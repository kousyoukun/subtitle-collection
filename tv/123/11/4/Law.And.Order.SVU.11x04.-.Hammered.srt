STABLER: Who puked?

17
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:34,488
The apartment owner,
when he discovered her.
Dalton Rindell.

18
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:35,858
He's got a pretty good
gash to the head.

19
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:36,953
Paramedics are
with him now.

20
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:38,122
We saw him
on the way in,

21
00:01:38,198 --> 00:01:39,256
but wanted to
get a handle on

22

what went down here
before we talked to him.

Fluids on her thigh
indicate sexual activity.

Rest of the story's
written on the wall.

Bludgeoned to death

I'd say you're looking
for a hammer.

28

Rindell called
91 1 at 7:34 a.m.

00:01:52,846 --> 00:01:54,814
Do you have
an approximate
time of death here?

the exact minute.

She tried to
shield her head

So, Rindell was out cold
for six and a half hours.

36
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:09,352
That's some
hit to the head.

37
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:11,590
This might explain
the perp's rage.

(READlNG)

00:02:16,336 --> 00:02:18,395
I thought Mr. Rindell's
name was Dalton.

40
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:20,336
He was having
an affair
with Audrey.

was consensual.

Mr. Rindell,

45
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,012
can you tell us
what happened?

46
00:02:33,186 --> 00:02:34,949
I was hoping
you could tell me.

47
00:02:35,021 --> 00:02:36,818
I don't remember anything.
My head is splitting.

48
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:39,085
Could his injury have
affected his memory?

49
00:02:39,192 --> 00:02:40,887

checked out fine.

50

STABLER: What exactly
is the nature of your
relationship with Audrey?

51
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:44,793
Who's Audrey?

52
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:46,491
The dead woman
on your
bedroom floor.

53
00:02:48,801 --> 00:02:50,359
We didn't have
any relationship.

54
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:52,768
Until I found her
this morning,

55
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:55,103
I'd never seen her
before in my life.

56
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:51,958
Melinda,
you got a minute?

57
00:03:52,031 --> 00:03:54,591
I was hoping to
pop her in the fridge
before she goes bad.

58
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:56,931
I'm thinking
it's Dalton's story
that's stinking.

59
00:03:57,003 --> 00:03:57,992
You like him for it.

60
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:59,902
Well, there was no
sign of forced entry.

61
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:02,134
But the victim's clothes,
purse and lD are missing.

62
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:03,368
Someone must have
taken them.

63
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:05,536
Someone Dalton doesn't
want us to know about.

64
00:04:05,612 --> 00:04:06,636
Drug dealer, pimp.

65
00:04:07,814 --> 00:04:08,974
We know she had sex.

66
00:04:09,048 --> 00:04:10,310
I need to know if
it was with Dalton.

67
00:04:10,483 --> 00:04:12,110
You mind coming upstairs
and doing a DNA swab?

68
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:13,174
We letting him
know why?

69
00:04:15,154 --> 00:04:16,712
I don't understand.
Why do you need
my fingerprints?

70
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:17,847
We take it from
anyone who has

71
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:19,619
Iegitimate access
to the apartment.

72
00:04:19,692 --> 00:04:20,852
Once we eliminate
the friendlies,

73
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:22,895
any unidentified print
could be the perp's.

74
00:04:22,962 --> 00:04:24,020
Got you.

75
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:25,894
We need you
to sign this so we can
search your apartment.

76
00:04:25,965 --> 00:04:28,661
That way, we don't have
to pester a judge
for a warrant.

77
00:04:29,202 --> 00:04:30,362
Why would you
need to do that?

78

There's no crime scene
exception to the
Fourth Amendment.

79

We need to keep
our searches legal.

Whatever you
need to do.

82
00:04:37,543 --> 00:04:38,737
But I don't get it.
Why did he pick me?

83
00:04:38,811 --> 00:04:41,075

anything like this?

I've never used
a prostitute.

00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:49,113
Sorry, without gallows
humor to cope with
what we see every day,

00:04:49,188 --> 00:04:50,815
I'd go stark
raving mad.

What do you
mean, "Go"?

90
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:54,289
How do you deal
with stress,
Mr. Rindell?

91
00:04:54,394 --> 00:04:55,986
Usually,
I avoid it.

Is it okay
if I take
a DNA sample?

94
00:04:59,365 --> 00:05:01,333
It's just a quick swab
of the inside
of your mouth.

95
00:05:01,401 --> 00:05:02,390
Won't hurt a bit.

With your permission.
Of course.

BENSON: Mr. Rindell,
do you own a hammer?

99
00:05:07,707 --> 00:05:08,731
Uh-huh.

100
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:10,799
It's not in
your toolbox.

101
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:13,475
Is that
what he used?

102
00:05:13,546 --> 00:05:15,070
I'm going to
be sick again.
I need some water.

103
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:17,241
We should get you
to the hospital and
have you checked out.

104
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:20,611
All right, let me
just grab my wallet.

105
00:05:25,091 --> 00:05:26,718
I'm not so sure
he doesn't know
the perp.

106
00:05:27,226 --> 00:05:29,251
If he's hiding something,
we'll find it.

107

DR. MANNlNG:
Looks like the paramedic
missed a sliver of glass.

108
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:36,896
Could that have caused
the memory loss?

109
00:05:36,969 --> 00:05:38,527
No, not deep enough.

110
00:05:38,604 --> 00:05:40,401
And your head CT
looks fine.

111

And you still don't
remember anything?

112
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:44,472
No. No, and I feel
like crap.

113
00:05:44,544 --> 00:05:47,479
Well, you're dehydrated.
I'll start an lV.

114
00:05:48,481 --> 00:05:50,381
Did you party
last night?
No.

115
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:51,508
Not at all.
I was working.

116

you how many victims

withhold information
about illegal drug use

118

they're going to
get into trouble.

STABLER: We're not
looking to jam you up

If you had a dealer
in your apartment

121
00:06:01,794 --> 00:06:03,125
or you were partying
with friends,

122
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:04,185
you just have
to tell us.

123
00:06:04,263 --> 00:06:06,857
I don't do drugs.
I don't even drink.

124
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:10,229
What if someone
drugged me?

125
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:12,633
Okay. Like who?

126
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:16,200
I don't know.

127
00:06:16,275 --> 00:06:18,675
Nayyar, how much longer
you going to keep this
bathroom tied up?

128
00:06:18,745 --> 00:06:19,769
You're worse
than my ex-wife.

129
00:06:19,846 --> 00:06:21,711
Someone let
a sweet talker
like you go?

130
00:06:21,781 --> 00:06:23,578
I'm done scanning.
It's all yours.

131
00:06:24,751 --> 00:06:27,379
Does CSU know
there's bloody
handprints in here?

132
00:06:27,453 --> 00:06:29,182
ANU: They're right behind
you in the lunch line.

133
00:06:29,255 --> 00:06:30,483
You know, those prints
look smeared to me,

134
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:32,217
but they'll
lift them all.

135
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:34,486
MUNCH:
Bloody towels, as well.
They're still damp.

136
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,858
Well,
no one from the canvass
saw a bloody maniac,

137
00:06:36,929 --> 00:06:40,023
so you've got to
figure he cleaned up
before he left.

138
00:06:43,536 --> 00:06:45,060
FlN: You didn't look
in the shower?

139
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,005
Washed clean.

140
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:51,306
He took a shower
while I was passed
out on the floor?

141
00:06:51,377 --> 00:06:54,642
Or maybe you came home
and surprised him
while he was in there.

142
00:06:54,714 --> 00:06:56,773
But why was I naked?
That's the million
dollar question.

143
00:06:56,849 --> 00:06:58,441
You think I raped her.
You think I did this?

144
00:06:58,518 --> 00:06:59,542
STABLER:
We're looking
for answers.

145
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:01,246
And you're not
providing any.

146
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,344
Well, I don't have any.

147
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,117
BENSON:
Dalton, calm down
and work with us.

148
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:07,921
We're trying to figure out
how a dead, naked woman
ended up in your apartment.

149
00:07:07,994 --> 00:07:09,621
What time did you
come home last night?

150
00:07:10,797 --> 00:07:12,059
I don't remember
coming home.

151
00:07:12,131 --> 00:07:13,291
You said
you were working.

152
00:07:13,366 --> 00:07:14,765
Where's that?
Did anybody see you?

153
00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:16,665
I'm a developer.

154
00:07:16,736 --> 00:07:19,102
My partner Bill and l
met with the buyers

00:07:19,172 --> 00:07:20,764
of these co-op units
we had presold.

156
00:07:22,241 --> 00:07:24,334
About 75 people showed up
to our headquarters.

157
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:26,071
Any one of them unhappy
with their purchase?

158
00:07:26,145 --> 00:07:28,875
All of them. Construction
hit a little speed bump,

159
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:32,384
so we threw
this cocktail mixer to
put their minds at ease.

160
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,682
Dalton,
you said you weren't
partying last night.

161
00:07:35,555 --> 00:07:37,819
Trust me.
It was no party.

162
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:43,387
BlLL: Dalton was
dripping flop sweat.

163
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,124
You have no idea
how crucial it was

164
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:46,756
to instill the investors
with confidence.

165
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:48,963
Of course I do.
That's step number one

166
00:07:49,035 --> 00:07:50,935
in The Idiot's Guide
to Flimflamming,

167
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:53,766
Hey, we're not running
the "Nigerian prince"
scam here.

168
00:07:55,074 --> 00:07:57,338
This is going to be
a landmark building.

169
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:58,968
When do you plan
on completing it?

170
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:00,842
Soon as we shore up
new financing.

171
00:08:00,913 --> 00:08:02,210
That was the point
of last night.

172
00:08:02,281 --> 00:08:05,011
You were trying to
suck even more money
out of these people?

173
00:08:05,451 --> 00:08:08,511
Otherwise,
we have to file bankruptcy
and they lose everything.

174
00:08:08,588 --> 00:08:10,613
Well, how much are
they already in for?

175
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:13,122
Two to four
hundred thousand each.

176
00:08:13,192 --> 00:08:15,592
So they all had motive
to murder both of you.

177
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:17,219
Or set you up for one.

178
00:08:17,296 --> 00:08:20,060
We were hoping
for a slightly more
enthusiastic response.

179
00:08:20,132 --> 00:08:22,828
That coward, Dalton,
left me to deal with them.

180
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:26,732
At the end of the cocktail
hour, I called the meeting
to order, and he was gone.

181
00:08:26,806 --> 00:08:29,206
Maybe he didn't
leave on his own.

182
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:33,133
I'll need a list
of your victims.
I mean, buyers.

183
00:08:33,212 --> 00:08:34,941
Absolutely not.

184
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:36,481
You can't drag them all
into a murder investigation.

185
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:39,109
Even if it means
clearing your partner?

186
00:08:41,587 --> 00:08:43,714
BOWMAN: Detectives.
What have we got?

187
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:45,620
The buildings
are connected.

188
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:47,659
That's Mr. Rindell's
bedroom window
right up there

189
00:08:47,727 --> 00:08:49,922
and the perp
must have tossed
this out of it.

190
00:08:49,996 --> 00:08:51,861
MUNCH: Oh!
What have we here?

191
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:57,098
FlN: We've got
ladies clothes,
shoes and a purse.

192
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:58,192
Why toss it over here?

193
00:08:58,271 --> 00:08:59,465
If he didn't
want it to be found,

194
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:00,665
he could have
thrown it in the river.

195
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,503
FlN: I don't know.

196
00:09:02,575 --> 00:09:04,600
But I just might have
found a motive
for her murder.

197
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,075
Our victim's a doctor.

198
00:09:06,145 --> 00:09:08,170
(MUNCH READlNG)

199
00:09:10,816 --> 00:09:12,340
They do abortions.

200
00:09:15,021 --> 00:09:16,579
We're so sorry
for your loss.

201
00:09:16,822 --> 00:09:19,154
Our divorce
was finalized
a few months ago,

202
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:21,591
but I never stopped
loving Audrey.

203
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:23,956
Friendly divorce?

204
00:09:24,096 --> 00:09:25,427
Is there such a thing?

205
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:27,430
You can't imagine
the screaming matches.

206
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,331
Me begging her
to leave her job
at the clinic

207
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:32,166
and her saying
she had a commitment
to uphold

208
00:09:32,271 --> 00:09:34,000
a constitutionally
protected service.

209
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,670
You didn't approve
of your wife's work.

210
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:38,403
I was afraid
for our daughter,
Clarissa.

211
00:09:38,477 --> 00:09:40,502
Your family
get threats?

212
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,606
A few years ago,
an anti-abortion group

213
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:45,412
posted hundreds
of doctors' names

214
00:09:45,885 --> 00:09:48,149
and home addresses
and telephone numbers
on the lnternet.

215
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:50,411
And we started
getting hang-up calls

216
00:09:50,489 --> 00:09:51,922
in the middle
of the night
and nasty letters.

217
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:53,219
Did you keep
any of them?

218
00:09:53,292 --> 00:09:56,455
No, I didn't
want our daughter
finding them.

219
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:59,362
And once that
doctor was shot

220
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:01,832
in his own church
in Kansas this summer,

221
00:10:02,835 --> 00:10:05,065
I petitioned the court
for sole custody,

222
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,602
but lost.

223
00:10:09,842 --> 00:10:13,642
And Audrey was supposed
to pick her up tomorrow.

224
00:10:14,246 --> 00:10:16,976
I told her this was
going to happen.

225
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:26,450
Mr. Hale, did you
or Audrey have any connection
with an R-T Developers?

226
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:30,119
No.

227
00:10:30,196 --> 00:10:32,357
STABLER: How about
a Dalton Rindell?

228
00:10:32,431 --> 00:10:34,422
Who's that?
One of those
fanatical nuts?

229
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,297
No, I am definitely
not one of them.

230
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:38,132
Let's play a little
free association.

231
00:10:38,204 --> 00:10:40,297
You say the first thing
that pops into your head.

232
00:10:40,373 --> 00:10:42,034
Roe v, Wade,

233
00:10:42,274 --> 00:10:43,673
Two ways to get
across a creek.

234
00:10:43,743 --> 00:10:45,904
You consider
Dr. Hale's murder
a joke?

235
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:47,570
No, no.

236
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:48,909
It was the most horrific
thing I've ever seen.

237
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:51,916
But I didn't do it.
I don't know her or
anything about her.

238
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:53,576
Then how did
she get in your
apartment?

239
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:56,315
Forget that.
How did she
get in your bed?

240
00:10:56,422 --> 00:10:58,413
Look. I know
it sounds crazy,

241
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:00,118
but it had to be one
of the co-op owners.

242
00:11:00,192 --> 00:11:01,352
I think
I'm being set up.

243
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:04,624
Okay. Here comes
the conspiracy theory.
You go.

244
00:11:05,598 --> 00:11:08,226
A guy puts a chunk down on
a three-million-dollar condo

245
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,494
that's never
going to be built.

246
00:11:09,568 --> 00:11:11,365
And he's not going to get
any of his money back.

247
00:11:11,437 --> 00:11:12,927
I can see that making
a guy a little nutty.

248
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:16,133
Right. So he starts
obsessing about
the ills of the world

249
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:18,267
and kills two birds
with one hammer.

250
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:20,574
We're going to need
the investors list
to prove that.

251
00:11:20,646 --> 00:11:21,943
We're hanging on
by a thread.

252
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:23,072
Could you
at least be discreet?

253
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:26,113
No problem. Just answer
my partner's question.

254
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:29,884
Which are you?
Pro-choice or no-choice?

255
00:11:29,955 --> 00:11:32,924
I know it's everybody's
litmus test for picking
a president

256
00:11:32,992 --> 00:11:35,426
or a Supreme Court
justice.

257
00:11:35,494 --> 00:11:36,893
It's not even on
my priority list.

258
00:11:36,962 --> 00:11:39,522
And I was just starting
to believe you, Mr. Rindell.

259
00:11:39,598 --> 00:11:41,327
Abortion is
the one subject

260
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,197
everyone has a strong
opinion about.

261
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:44,463
Abortion is murder.

262
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:46,471
You know,
that's what I've been
trying to tell her.

263
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:47,563
What group
are you with?

264
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,130
Operation
Save and Deliver.

265
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,641
Life begins
at conception.

266
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:51,836
BENSON: What if
my life is at risk?

267
00:11:51,911 --> 00:11:53,640
It's in God's hands,
not yours.

268
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:55,010
And what if
I told you
I was raped?

269
00:11:55,081 --> 00:11:57,481
Well, the Lord
wouldn't have brought
a child into this world

270
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,347
if he didn't have
great plans for it.

271
00:11:59,418 --> 00:12:01,386
Even though she'll be
a constant reminder?

272
00:12:02,621 --> 00:12:04,714
You have no idea
the toll that
takes on a woman.

273
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:06,917
You must have been
happy when Dr. Hale
was murdered.

274
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:08,991
No, no, no, no.
That was awful.

275
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:10,619
We don't condone
any killing.

276
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:17,397
But it is a blessing
there's one less
mass murderer out there.

lronically, the young
women she scares away

278

for birth control.

279
00:12:22,808 --> 00:12:24,969
So, yes, she's a danger,
but not a violent one.

280
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:27,239
So what's with
the bulletproof
glass here?

281
00:12:27,313 --> 00:12:29,941
Well, we had that
put in in '93 after
our sniper attack.

282

Well, not here,
but I monitor
the national stats.

there have been
175 arsons, 41 bombings.

286
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:41,886
Dr. Hale's ex-husband
was telling us

287
00:12:41,961 --> 00:12:43,258
about the hate mail
they received at home.

288

Yeah, well,
we get plenty
of that here.

out for you.

This is the first box.

291
00:12:47,299 --> 00:12:48,391
Okay.

292

How many more
like this?

293
00:12:51,036 --> 00:12:52,901
There are five or six.

Get down.

296

Just a harmless
egging. We get that
from time to time.

297
00:13:02,214 --> 00:13:03,476
Did you do this?

298
00:13:03,983 --> 00:13:05,416
It was a couple of kids.

299
00:13:05,584 --> 00:13:06,676
Which way
did they go?

300
00:13:06,752 --> 00:13:08,845
I don't know.
I had my eyes closed.

301
00:13:08,921 --> 00:13:11,446
But I'm touched
for your concern
for the chicken fetuses.

Let's go see
if she made it.

306
00:13:23,836 --> 00:13:26,202
We had dinner
at Picholine.

307
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:29,969
We left there around
9:30, shared a taxi.

308
00:13:30,042 --> 00:13:31,168
So Audrey went home?

309
00:13:31,777 --> 00:13:35,144
No, there was
night construction on 5th,

310
00:13:35,281 --> 00:13:37,511
and we were in
standstill traffic.

311
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:41,110
I saw this bar.
Said we should get out
and have a nightcap.

312
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:44,047
Audrey didn't want to,
but I dragged her.

313
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:45,453
Do you remember
the name of the bar?

314
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:47,683
That's what
I'm looking for.

315
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,091
BENSON:
Anyone there
hassling her?

316
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:50,958
No, but there
was this guy.

317
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:54,892
Okay. Linda.
Linda. It's okay.
Calm down.

318
00:13:58,604 --> 00:14:00,071
Just tell us about him.

319
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:04,506
White, 30s,
really good looking.

320
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:07,813
Audrey hadn't even
looked at another man
since her divorce.

321
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,745
I'm the one that
got them talking.

322
00:14:09,815 --> 00:14:11,442
Well, could he
have instigated it?

323
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:12,711
Maybe he followed you
into the place?

324
00:14:14,086 --> 00:14:17,317
No. It looked like
he'd been there
for a while. Oh!

325
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:21,451
Here it is.

326
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:23,188
Okay. That's good,
but back to the guy...

327
00:14:24,129 --> 00:14:25,289
They really hit it off.

328
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:27,025
STABLER: How did it
end with them?

329
00:14:28,767 --> 00:14:30,132
I don't know.

330
00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:35,800
I just left her there.
I thought I was
doing her a favor.

331
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,400
Did you get
the guy's name?

332
00:14:38,477 --> 00:14:40,536
Something like Barnes.

333
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:45,650
I just remember
it was the name
of a book store.

334
00:14:47,086 --> 00:14:48,110
Dalton?

335
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,648
Yes.

336
00:14:50,522 --> 00:14:51,887
I appreciate
the lift home.
I'm exhausted.

to do a quick stop here.

know this place?

DALTON: No.

341
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,561
It's walking distance
from your office.

342
00:15:02,635 --> 00:15:04,330
I haven't been to a bar
in over a year.

343
00:15:07,606 --> 00:15:08,937

Sure you weren't
here last night?

346
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:18,341
I'm positive.
Why do you keep
asking me?

347
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:21,511
Look, I'm in the program.

eight days sober.

So, Dalton.

353
00:15:33,232 --> 00:15:36,497
You had a headache,
you were throwing up,
you were dehydrated.

354
00:15:36,568 --> 00:15:37,762
I was hit in the head.

355
00:15:37,836 --> 00:15:39,360
Or you had a hangover.

356
00:15:41,073 --> 00:15:42,870
I don't drink.
I need to use the restroom.

Hey. Wait a minute.

BARTENDER:
That's the guy
right there.

00:15:55,421 --> 00:15:56,479
Dalton,
what are you
doing in here?

363
00:15:56,555 --> 00:15:57,647
Where's the men's room?

00:15:57,723 --> 00:15:59,088
What, you don't remember
from last night?

365
00:15:59,858 --> 00:16:00,916
What are you
talking about?

366
00:16:00,993 --> 00:16:02,790
Well, you were
knocking them back.

367
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,225
What's going on here?

368
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:07,424
Well, the bartender
says that you were
buying Audrey rounds

369
00:16:07,499 --> 00:16:08,591
after her friend left.

370
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:10,032
Why would you
say that?

371
00:16:10,102 --> 00:16:12,127
Buddy, you two
left together.

372

Back. Let go.

Take it easy.

376

I'm going to be
sick again.

Son of a bitch.
We lost him.

Now, what part of
taking a killer rapist
on a field trip

399
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:28,444
sounded like
a bright idea?

technically under...

of making their own

have eyes on Dalton.

This one is on me.
It was equally
my responsibility.

Spare me the mutual

What are we doing
to fix this?

We sat on his
apartment
all last night.

410
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:46,998
He was smart enough
not to come home.

411
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:48,964
Got a subpoena for
his cell phone records.

412
00:17:49,034 --> 00:17:51,400
And somebody's watching
the garage where
he keeps his car.

413
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:54,234
I put the word out
to the airport, train,
and bus terminals.

414
00:17:54,306 --> 00:17:56,001
His bank has an alert
on his credit and debit cards.

415
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:57,337
He hasn't
used them yet.

416
00:17:57,409 --> 00:18:00,572
Well, then, somebody
is harboring him.
Girlfriend? Parents?

417
00:18:00,646 --> 00:18:02,910
Dalton told us
he wasn't dating
anybody seriously,

418
00:18:02,981 --> 00:18:04,710
but we did
a little digging.

00:18:04,783 --> 00:18:06,648
His parents divorced
when he was a kid.

420

His father's

and his mother died from
cirrhosis of the liver.

Appears no one in
the Rindell clan can
handle their liquor.

423
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:14,884
There were multiple

through a Wade hearing

00:18:48,894 --> 00:18:50,054
Want to join me?

your recreation
of the crime scene

Leica Scan Station,

443
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,461
which you can
show to the jury
from any angle.

444
00:19:00,572 --> 00:19:03,166
Dalton approached
from the left,
wielding the hammer.

445
00:19:03,242 --> 00:19:04,800
Audrey must have seen
the first swing coming,

446
00:19:04,877 --> 00:19:07,744
scrambles out of the bed,
still tangled in the sheets.

447
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,279
Dalton comes around.

448
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:10,713

Tries to
ward off the first blow,
which breaks her wrist.

451
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:15,749
As he hauls back for
the second strike, he...

452
00:19:15,854 --> 00:19:17,845
Wait, wait,
wait, wait.

453
00:19:17,923 --> 00:19:19,151
She was raped first,
right?

454
00:19:20,225 --> 00:19:21,715
You want me
to simulate that?

455
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:25,528
Actually,
it's looking like the
sex was consensual.

456
00:19:25,597 --> 00:19:26,894
I mean,
they hooked up
in a bar.

457
00:19:26,965 --> 00:19:28,227
They both were
drinking heavily.

458
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:29,356
Oh, please.

459
00:19:29,434 --> 00:19:31,561
Half the rapists
I've put away
were drunk or high.

460
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:34,731
It's called Dutch courage.
It doesn't excuse jack.

461
00:19:34,806 --> 00:19:36,364
And stopping her
from crying rape

462
00:19:36,441 --> 00:19:38,568
is a motive to
kill her, right?
Keep going.

463
00:19:40,612 --> 00:19:42,079
ANU: Audrey's
on her side.

464
00:19:42,147 --> 00:19:44,741
He strikes her temple,
causing this arterial

465
00:19:44,816 --> 00:19:46,249
spurting pattern
on the carpet.

466
00:19:46,718 --> 00:19:49,448
Now, she's face down,
covering her head
with her hands.

467
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:51,421
One of the strikes
breaks her watch.

468
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:53,355
It's going to be hard
for a jury to watch.

469
00:19:53,425 --> 00:19:55,222
But easy for them
to convict.

470
00:19:55,294 --> 00:19:56,727
Castoff extends
onto the ceiling.

471
00:19:56,795 --> 00:19:58,524
Means he was bringing
the hammer back

472
00:19:58,597 --> 00:19:59,655
all the way
over his head
for each blow.

473
00:19:59,731 --> 00:20:02,495
Well, wait.
This shows him
covered in blood.

474
00:20:02,568 --> 00:20:04,297
There would
have been tons
of back spatter.

475
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:05,859
Well, do we have
his bloody clothes?

476
00:20:06,505 --> 00:20:08,166
No. He must have
been naked, too.

477
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,573
So, after he cleaned up,
he realized what he'd done,

478
00:20:11,643 --> 00:20:12,837
and he started
banging his head

479
00:20:12,911 --> 00:20:14,037
against the medicine
cabinet mirror.

480
00:20:14,112 --> 00:20:15,636
Bull. He was
staging the scene

481
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:17,739
to make it look like
he'd been attacked,
as well.

482
00:20:17,816 --> 00:20:19,909
OFFlCER: Captain,
this just came in.

483
00:20:20,252 --> 00:20:22,482
Well, if juries want
a video of the crime,

484
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:23,919
you're practically
giving them one.

485
00:20:23,989 --> 00:20:26,514
Yeah.
This is really good.

486
00:20:28,293 --> 00:20:30,158
Listen.
Raise the production
values for me.

487
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:31,355
Spare no expense.

488
00:20:33,365 --> 00:20:34,764
We just got Dalton's
cell phone records.

489
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:38,863
Dozens of calls
to the partner,
all unanswered.

490
00:20:38,937 --> 00:20:41,667
But he had a nice
long chat with his ex.

491
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:46,907
CELlNA: I have no idea
where Dalton is,

492
00:20:46,979 --> 00:20:51,313
Really? He didn't mention it
during your 17-minute
conversation last night?

493
00:20:51,783 --> 00:20:54,047
No. He just told me
his insane story.

494
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:55,143
It end with
a confession?

495
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:57,211
He swears
he's being set up.

496
00:20:57,289 --> 00:20:59,257
He asked you for
a place to hole up,
didn't he?

497
00:20:59,324 --> 00:21:00,689
He asked.
I said no.

498
00:21:01,493 --> 00:21:03,893
Well, you mind taking us
to your place to verify that?

499
00:21:03,962 --> 00:21:06,192
Not at all. As soon as
my open house is over.

500
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:09,098
FlN: Well, of course,
you being a rental agent,
you have access

501
00:21:09,167 --> 00:21:10,657
to plenty of apartments
you can stash him in.

502
00:21:10,736 --> 00:21:12,294
You're not going
to make us get
a search warrant

503
00:21:12,371 --> 00:21:13,565
for every one of them,
are you?

504
00:21:15,207 --> 00:21:16,504
After what Dalton
put me through?

505
00:21:16,575 --> 00:21:18,008
I'd never help
that son of a bitch.

506
00:21:18,076 --> 00:21:19,100
Bad marriage?

507
00:21:20,345 --> 00:21:22,643
Varied days of
wine and roses.

508
00:21:22,714 --> 00:21:25,239
I quit drinking.
Dalton couldn't.

509
00:21:25,317 --> 00:21:26,375
Was he abusive?

510
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:28,180
The real Dalton
is the greatest guy
you'll ever meet.

511
00:21:28,253 --> 00:21:31,552
But when he drinks,
he turns into a monster.

512
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:34,421
He kicked a lot of
holes in our walls,
but he only hurt me once.

513
00:21:34,493 --> 00:21:35,517
That's when I walked.

514
00:21:35,594 --> 00:21:37,289
Well, be grateful
you're still alive.

515
00:21:37,829 --> 00:21:39,729
Sober, he wouldn't
hurt a fly.

516
00:21:40,432 --> 00:21:42,525
I heard he went on
the wagon after
our divorce was final.

517
00:21:42,601 --> 00:21:44,933
Yeah, well, he fell
off with a big splash.

518
00:21:45,003 --> 00:21:46,868
If you wouldn't
help him, who would?

519
00:21:47,205 --> 00:21:48,399
(SCOFFS)

520
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:52,739
His old drinking buddy.
His business partner,
Bill Tattenger.

521
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,980
You son of a bitch!
Hey! Police!
Break it up!

522
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:00,575
Hey! Hey! Police!
Break it up!

523
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:02,142
Break it up!
Break it up!

524
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:04,017
What are you doing?
You're only
making things worse.

525
00:22:04,089 --> 00:22:06,216
First, evading arrest,
and now assault?

526
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:08,623
DALTON: I didn't run
because I was guilty.

527
00:22:08,694 --> 00:22:10,457
I ran because I needed
to prove my innocence.

528
00:22:10,529 --> 00:22:11,723
Admit what you did.

529
00:22:11,797 --> 00:22:13,196
He's out of his
freaking mind.

530
00:22:13,265 --> 00:22:14,289
Now, he's under arrest.

531
00:22:14,366 --> 00:22:15,355
It doesn't matter.

532
00:22:15,434 --> 00:22:18,232
I finally figured out
who's responsible for this.

533
00:22:18,303 --> 00:22:20,328
Tell them.
Tell them!

534
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:22,734
(SlGHS)

535
00:22:23,275 --> 00:22:24,765
What? Tell us what?

536
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:28,441
We were dying there!

537
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:31,277
Back in the day,
you closed million dollar
deals over drinks.

538
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,682
I convinced him
a little liquid courage
would steady his nerves.

539
00:22:33,752 --> 00:22:35,185
You ruined my life!

540
00:22:35,253 --> 00:22:37,016
No, let's go.
Let's go.

541
00:22:37,489 --> 00:22:38,786
There's no way
one drink put me
on my ass.

542
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:39,846
What did you
put in it?

543
00:22:40,392 --> 00:22:42,553
Nothing! I didn't do
anything illegal.

544
00:22:42,627 --> 00:22:44,754
No, not by
frat boy standards.

545
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:47,321
"You want to have
your way with them?
Get them nice and drunk."

546
00:22:47,399 --> 00:22:51,233
I swear to God,
I only gave him one.
What harm could that do?

547
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:55,101
Look, I'm on
a prescription
benzo for anxiety.

548
00:22:55,173 --> 00:22:56,765
You're not supposed
to mix that with alcohol.

549
00:22:56,842 --> 00:22:58,173
Bill kept telling me
one wouldn't hurt.

550
00:22:58,243 --> 00:23:00,074
He must have made
the drink a lot stronger
than he told me.

551
00:23:00,145 --> 00:23:01,510
Well, the thing is,
after you left Bill,

552
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:02,911
you drank seven
or eight on your own.

553
00:23:02,981 --> 00:23:03,970
That we know of.

554
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:05,243
Yeah, but I didn't
even know I was doing it.

555
00:23:05,317 --> 00:23:07,649
I don't even remember
leaving the office.
All right?

556
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:10,552
The combination of meds
and alcohol must have
completely disoriented me.

557
00:23:10,622 --> 00:23:12,249
You had no problem
finding the nearest bar.

558
00:23:12,324 --> 00:23:13,586
And you were the one
who did the ordering.

559
00:23:13,658 --> 00:23:15,489
Not Bill.
Not Audrey. You.

560
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:19,993
It's only because
Bill pressured me
into that first drink.

561
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:22,090
That's the reason I quit
in the first place.

562
00:23:22,167 --> 00:23:24,965
Look. Once I have one
in me, I can't stop.

563
00:23:25,937 --> 00:23:27,199
(EXHALES)

564
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,605
What a load of crap.

565
00:23:30,675 --> 00:23:33,235
It's not
that he couldn't stop.
He just didn't want to.

566
00:23:33,311 --> 00:23:35,336
CRAGEN: It's not that
cut and dry, Sonya.

567
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:37,473
Alcoholism is
a recognized addiction.

568
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:40,346
That millions of people
have successfully overcome.

569
00:23:41,353 --> 00:23:43,685
I've been sober
over 20 years,

570
00:23:44,456 --> 00:23:46,390
but I struggle
with it every day.

571
00:23:46,858 --> 00:23:48,758
It's not something
you ever overcome.

572
00:23:48,827 --> 00:23:51,819
But you're not
drinking, are you?
Proving my point.

573
00:23:52,063 --> 00:23:53,655
Alcohol is
just a crutch

574
00:23:53,732 --> 00:23:55,893
for weak-willed,
pathetic losers.

575
00:23:57,536 --> 00:24:00,004
How many
coffees and cigarettes
you have today, Sonya?

576
00:24:00,071 --> 00:24:03,905
(SCOFFlNG) Oh, please.
I can quit anytime I want.

577
00:24:04,176 --> 00:24:05,939
And if I committed
a felony,

578
00:24:06,011 --> 00:24:08,775
I wouldn't trot them out
like the old Twinkie defense.

579
00:24:08,847 --> 00:24:10,906
Intoxication
has never been
and never will

580
00:24:10,982 --> 00:24:12,677
be a defense to
rape and murder.

581
00:24:12,751 --> 00:24:13,911
Well, you have at it
on the murder,

582
00:24:13,985 --> 00:24:15,953
but I don't think
you're getting him
on the rape.

583
00:24:16,021 --> 00:24:19,354
Actually, Captain,
there's someone here
you need to talk to.

584
00:24:20,225 --> 00:24:22,921
I used to be
an assistant at
R-T Developers.

585
00:24:22,994 --> 00:24:24,393
A friend who still
works there called

586
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:26,897
and told me what
Dalton was arrested for.

587
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,595
You don't seem
too surprised.

588
00:24:32,504 --> 00:24:36,702
A little over a year ago,
just after Dalton
and Celina separated,

589
00:24:37,275 --> 00:24:40,267
I was working late and
went in to let him know
I was leaving.

590
00:24:40,912 --> 00:24:41,970
And what happened?

591
00:24:42,047 --> 00:24:43,912
He'd been drinking
in there all day.

592
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:46,780
He exposed himself.

593
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:52,082
I tried to leave,
but he cornered me.

594
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:01,494
He grabbed my breast

595
00:25:07,272 --> 00:25:09,536
and forced his hand
down my pants.

596
00:25:17,449 --> 00:25:19,178
I told you
he was a rapist.

597
00:25:24,155 --> 00:25:25,247
So, let me guess.
You have no memory

598
00:25:25,323 --> 00:25:27,052
of sexually assaulting
your old assistant.

599
00:25:27,125 --> 00:25:28,592
Oh, I took
responsibility
for that.

600
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:31,720
Paying a girl off
to keep her from
filing criminal charges

601
00:25:31,796 --> 00:25:33,423
is not taking
responsibility.

602
00:25:33,498 --> 00:25:35,932
Ask Glenna when
that happened.

603
00:25:36,001 --> 00:25:37,662
It was the day
I finally admitted
I had a problem.

604
00:25:37,736 --> 00:25:39,135
I quit cold turkey.

605
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:40,432
I thought the DTs
were going to kill me,

606
00:25:40,505 --> 00:25:42,496
but I never
touched another drop.

607
00:25:42,574 --> 00:25:44,735
Not until Bill practically
poured it down my throat.

608
00:25:44,809 --> 00:25:48,108
Oh, cut the crap.
Geez.

609
00:25:48,179 --> 00:25:49,771
Need something, Sonya?

610
00:25:49,848 --> 00:25:53,477
Yeah. For him to admit
he killed
and raped Audrey Hale.

611
00:25:53,585 --> 00:25:55,246
I got tired of watching
you two play patty cake.

DALTON: How can
I admit something
I don't remember?

613
00:25:57,822 --> 00:26:00,450
Look, I had
a history of blackouts
in my drinking days.

614
00:26:00,525 --> 00:26:02,823
One time, I woke up
in a hotel room in Phoenix.

615
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:04,259
I had no clue
how I got there.

616
00:26:04,329 --> 00:26:06,661
"The liquor made me do it.
My partner made me do it."

617
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:07,993
He did.
He admitted it.

618
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:09,090
Please.

619
00:26:09,167 --> 00:26:11,067
It's not like
he slipped you a Mickey.

620
00:26:11,136 --> 00:26:13,866
And he's not the one
who killed Audrey.
You are.

621
00:26:13,939 --> 00:26:15,566
You lured her
to your place,

622
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:16,834
found out what
she did for a living,

623
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:18,705
and then you killed her
in a drunken rage.

624
00:26:18,777 --> 00:26:19,835
I'm not even
anti-abortion.

625
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:20,935
Okay.

626
00:26:21,012 --> 00:26:22,138
So her profession
was just a fluke.

627
00:26:22,213 --> 00:26:23,407
Then why did
you kill her?

628
00:26:23,481 --> 00:26:24,470
I don't know!

629
00:26:24,549 --> 00:26:26,813
I swear, I have
no memory of what
happened that night.

630
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:31,955
Fine. Maybe this
will jog your memory.

631
00:26:50,542 --> 00:26:51,975
That's me.
Yeah.

632
00:26:52,043 --> 00:26:53,704
You can't show that
to a jury, can you?

No, not with your likeness,
but everything else.

just for you.

(DOOR CLOSES)

639
00:27:14,332 --> 00:27:17,301
DR. SOPHER: While
the initial decision
to drink is a choice,

640
00:27:17,369 --> 00:27:19,132
there comes a time
when the addiction switch

641
00:27:19,204 --> 00:27:20,865
is turned on
in the brain.

642
00:27:20,939 --> 00:27:23,430
I believe
this is the case
with Mr. Rindell.

643
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:26,569
Dr. Sopher,
you conducted a study

644
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:29,341
involving the brain
imaging of alcoholics.

645
00:27:29,414 --> 00:27:30,779
DR. SOPHER: Yes,
and the results...

646
00:27:30,849 --> 00:27:32,282
The People renew
their objection

647
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:33,874
to this hearing
in its entirety.

Counselor.

649
00:27:35,053 --> 00:27:38,989
It doesn't matter what
voodoo science she trots
out as an excuse.

650
00:27:39,057 --> 00:27:41,082
Intoxication has been
banned as a defense

651
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:42,592
to rape and murder
dating back...

652
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:46,358
The People didn't meet
their burden for rape.
That charge was dropped.

653
00:27:46,765 --> 00:27:48,528
Banned as a defense
to murder

654
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,864
dating back to
the 19th century.

655
00:27:50,935 --> 00:27:53,369
Would Your Honor
remind Ms. Paxton

656
00:27:53,438 --> 00:27:56,896
that the entire point
of a Frye hearing

657
00:27:56,975 --> 00:28:01,571
is to consider
the admissibility of
new science at trial?

658
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:05,172
I do have other
matters to consider.
Objection overruled.

659
00:28:05,717 --> 00:28:07,514
Continue with
your witness,
Mr. Kressler.

660
00:28:09,921 --> 00:28:11,912
What was the outcome
of your study?

661
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:15,926
Addiction is
a neurobiological disease.
A brain disease.

662
00:28:16,327 --> 00:28:18,124
You have evidence
to support this?

663
00:28:18,229 --> 00:28:21,494
Imaging of
addicted individuals
shows physical changes

664
00:28:21,566 --> 00:28:26,094
in areas of the brain
critical to judgment,
memory and behavioral control.

665
00:28:26,171 --> 00:28:29,663
So while Mr. Rindell
took a drink
of his own volition,

666
00:28:29,741 --> 00:28:32,471
because of his disease,
he was physically incapable

667
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:34,136
of controlling the urge
to keep drinking.

668
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:36,909
Which led him to kill.

669
00:28:39,084 --> 00:28:43,214
Dr. Sopher,
do all addicts
commit murder?

670
00:28:43,955 --> 00:28:45,650
No, of course not.

671
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:48,384
And your findings,
are they generally
accepted

672
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:50,291
within the scientific
community?

673
00:28:50,361 --> 00:28:52,522
We do have
our detractors.

674
00:28:52,697 --> 00:28:53,755
Huh!

675
00:28:57,102 --> 00:29:00,594
Do you believe
if I had an
inoperable tumor,

676
00:29:00,672 --> 00:29:02,139
that I could
just will it away?

677
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:03,465
No.

678
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:05,475
Because a tumor
is a disease.

679
00:29:05,543 --> 00:29:08,034
Not a behavior. Right?

680
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:18,849
Alcoholics stop drinking
all the time
by sheer willpower alone.

681
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:24,894
And you know why
they can do that?

682
00:29:25,497 --> 00:29:28,694
Because alcoholism
is not a disease.

683
00:29:34,205 --> 00:29:37,265
Good news, people!
Judge Moredock
isn't allowing

684
00:29:37,342 --> 00:29:40,505
Dalton's cockamamie
"alcoholism is
a disease" defense.

685
00:29:40,812 --> 00:29:43,007
Well, I'm familiar
with Dr. Sopher's work.

686
00:29:43,081 --> 00:29:45,743
The point of her research
isn't to excuse
criminal behavior.

687
00:29:45,817 --> 00:29:46,943
It's to find a cure.

688
00:29:47,018 --> 00:29:48,485
Yeah. Well,
good luck with that.

689
00:29:48,553 --> 00:29:51,249
Imagine if they could.
Crime rate
would be down 50%.

690
00:29:51,322 --> 00:29:52,482
More than that
for sexual assaults.

691

Some of us might
be out of a job.

692

Please. People do
bad things because
they're bad people.

693
00:29:56,161 --> 00:29:57,685
Getting drunk to do it
is just an excuse.

(CHUCKLlNG) Olivia, finally,
we agree on something.

had been a cure

still be alive.

Wait, Mommy liked
her cocktail, or...

698
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:12,970
My mother was
a falling-down drunk.

699
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:15,843
She died going down
a flight of stairs.

700
00:30:17,715 --> 00:30:20,445
She started drinking
after she was raped.
To cope.

701
00:30:20,518 --> 00:30:23,351
Yeah, she never quite
managed to do that
with me there.

702
00:30:24,556 --> 00:30:26,421
Well, no offense to
your mother, Olivia,

703
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:28,482
but you can't hide
behind a bottle.

704
00:30:28,927 --> 00:30:31,691
Now, Dalton is claiming
temporary insanity

705
00:30:31,763 --> 00:30:33,663
due to alcoholic
psychosis.

706
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:37,159
Well, take it
from somebody
who's been there.

707
00:30:37,235 --> 00:30:40,204
Odds are there will be
a sympathetic drinker
on that jury

That weasel, Kressler,
said he knew I was losing

731
00:31:50,141 --> 00:31:53,542
and purposely
played the wrong disc
to force a mistrial.

732
00:31:55,046 --> 00:31:56,673
It was an accident,
wasn't it?

733
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:59,581
Of course it was.
Geez.

734
00:31:59,784 --> 00:32:01,581
But the judge
isn't convinced.

735
00:32:01,653 --> 00:32:03,780
So he's polling
the jurors tomorrow

736
00:32:03,855 --> 00:32:05,948
to see if they can
disregard the video.

737
00:32:06,024 --> 00:32:07,048
What if some
of them can't?

738
00:32:07,125 --> 00:32:08,490
Then he'll have
to release them.

739
00:32:09,394 --> 00:32:12,852
Even with the alternates,
if the pool dips below 12,

740
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:15,494
he'll have no choice
but to declare a mistrial.

741
00:32:15,566 --> 00:32:16,624
So, you'll get
him on retrial.

742
00:32:16,701 --> 00:32:20,296
Not if the judge
determines there was
prosecutorial misconduct.

743
00:32:21,539 --> 00:32:25,669
In that case,
double jeopardy attaches,
and there is no retrial.

00:32:25,743 --> 00:32:29,235
Party's over.
Everybody just
goes on home.

00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:27,267
I was involved
in a fender bender
on my way, and...

765
00:33:27,372 --> 00:33:28,862
MOREDOCK:
Are you all right?

766
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:31,374
Oh, yeah.
Yeah. I'm fine.

767
00:33:31,442 --> 00:33:33,672
Thank you.
I'm just... Ooh!

768
00:33:34,312 --> 00:33:36,109
I made it. I was just...

MOREDOCK:
You don't look
all right to me.

770
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:39,908
Do you need
medical help?

771
00:33:39,984 --> 00:33:42,214
No, no, no, no, no.

772
00:33:42,653 --> 00:33:45,645
I might have hit my head
in the fender bender,

773
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:47,218
but I can play hurt.

774
00:33:47,725 --> 00:33:49,386
Alright. I can...

(BREATHlNG HEAVlLY)

776
00:33:51,929 --> 00:33:53,055
I'm ready to proceed,
Your Honor.

777
00:33:53,131 --> 00:33:54,496
MOREDOCK:
I think you need
to be looked at.

778
00:33:54,565 --> 00:33:55,827
She's drunk.

779
00:33:56,234 --> 00:33:58,293
Excuse me?
She's drunk.

780
00:33:58,436 --> 00:34:00,870
Excuse me, Dalton?
Are you... Did you
say something to me?

781
00:34:00,938 --> 00:34:01,927
Trust me.
I would know.

782
00:34:02,006 --> 00:34:03,405
Your Honor,
this is outrageous.

783
00:34:03,474 --> 00:34:06,375
Oh, what's your problem,
you tiny little man?

784
00:34:06,444 --> 00:34:07,843
Hey, Dalton?
MOREDOCK:
Ms. Paxton.

785
00:34:07,945 --> 00:34:08,969
Huh?

786
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:10,446
Have you been drinking?

787
00:34:11,249 --> 00:34:14,741
No, no, no, no,
not at all.

788
00:34:14,819 --> 00:34:16,377
I'm just exhausted,
Your Honor.

789
00:34:16,454 --> 00:34:18,445
I was up all night
preparing.

790
00:34:18,523 --> 00:34:19,990
What? Drinks?
PAXTON: No.

791
00:34:20,124 --> 00:34:23,616
I was going over
Detective Benson's
testimony with her.

792
00:34:25,129 --> 00:34:26,221
Ask her.

793
00:34:26,597 --> 00:34:29,794
Bailiff? Get Detective
Benson over here.

794
00:34:30,501 --> 00:34:32,662
And have her bring
a breathalyzer.

795
00:34:41,479 --> 00:34:44,107
Where would you like me
to administer the test,
Your Honor?

796
00:34:44,682 --> 00:34:45,876
Right at the Defense table?

797
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:46,939
Guess again.

798
00:34:47,018 --> 00:34:49,418
Unfortunately,
the Prosecution.

799
00:34:53,291 --> 00:34:54,280
BENSON: No.

800
00:34:55,293 --> 00:34:56,419
You can't be serious.

801
00:34:56,494 --> 00:34:58,462
Could you please
clear this up, Olivia?

802
00:34:58,529 --> 00:35:00,463
They're trying to
ruin my reputation.

803
00:35:00,531 --> 00:35:03,989
I have no desire to ruin
your reputation, Counselor.

804
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:08,766
Detective,
were you drinking with
Ms. Paxton last night?

805
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:09,829
I wasn't drinking.

806
00:35:09,974 --> 00:35:10,998
Was she?

807
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:18,347
I saw her consume
two drinks.

808
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:20,546
So you did lie to me.

809
00:35:21,052 --> 00:35:24,180
How many drinks
did you have after
Detective Benson left?

810
00:35:24,255 --> 00:35:26,655
I object to this
line of questioning,
Your Honor.

811
00:35:26,724 --> 00:35:27,816
MOREDOCK: Then blow.

812
00:35:27,992 --> 00:35:31,155
No. I can attest,
as an officer
of this court,

813
00:35:31,229 --> 00:35:32,890
that I am not
intoxicated.

814
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:36,127
Sonya, your eyes are
bloodshot and watery.

815
00:35:37,168 --> 00:35:39,636
Your speech is slurred,
and you stink of booze.

816
00:35:40,771 --> 00:35:42,102
Now blow!

817
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:44,630
I thought
you were my friend.

818
00:35:44,709 --> 00:35:45,801
Just do it.

819
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:48,911
Don't do this
to me, Olivia.

820
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,242
Please don't
do this to me.

821
00:35:50,348 --> 00:35:52,839
You did this
to yourself, Sonya.

822
00:35:52,917 --> 00:35:53,975
Now, blow.

00:36:03,127 --> 00:36:04,116
I got it.

826
00:36:04,195 --> 00:36:05,787
MOREDOCK:
Bring it up here.
Let me see.

827
00:36:07,965 --> 00:36:11,401
I saw it, Your Honor.
It's 0.07.
It's legally sober.

828
00:36:11,636 --> 00:36:13,263
I was hoping
for a zero.

829
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:14,929
It's still climbing.

830

your blood level
count is 0.082.

831
00:36:20,378 --> 00:36:23,575
That's residual
from last night.
I'm fine, Your Honor.

I am ready to proceed.

833

MOREDOCK: Counselor,
you have a problem.

834
00:36:28,786 --> 00:36:31,414
I'm ordering you removed
from this courtroom.

835

I've got it.
I've got it.

839
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:44,727
Then go.

840
00:36:45,069 --> 00:36:46,058
I've got it.

841
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,974
A shocking development
in the trial of
Dalton Rindell

842
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:01,382
for the murder
of abortion doctor
Audrey Hale.

843
00:37:01,452 --> 00:37:04,046
A mistrial
was declared after a
crime scene recreation,

844
00:37:04,121 --> 00:37:06,385
concocted
by the Prosecution,
was shown to the jury

845
00:37:06,457 --> 00:37:08,948
with the defendant's image
Photoshopped onto it.

846
00:37:09,627 --> 00:37:12,152
BENSON: I hope you know that
you're the luckiest man alive.

847
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:14,357
You think?

848
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:15,554
No matter
how long I live,

849
00:37:15,633 --> 00:37:17,828
no matter what I do
with the rest of my life,

It's still
all about you.

I've destroyed
so many lives.

854
00:37:33,317 --> 00:37:35,649
You're finally
owning up to it?

855

You know, you can never
serve time for this,

856

no matter what
you tell me.

857

So why don't you
get it off your chest?

Tell me.

After seeing
all the evidence,

after watching
that Prosecutor

861
00:37:57,975 --> 00:38:01,376
falling down drunk,
ruining her own career,

862
00:38:03,314 --> 00:38:05,782
it was like looking
in the mirror.

(SOBBlNG)

864
00:38:09,854 --> 00:38:12,152
I finally realized I had
done it. I killed her.

865
00:38:14,258 --> 00:38:15,316
Why?

866
00:38:17,395 --> 00:38:20,228
I swear I don't know.
I swear to God.

867
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:24,965
Oh, I had no reason
to hurt her.

868
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:28,863
My doctor told me that
in an alcoholic blackout,

869
00:38:28,939 --> 00:38:32,375
maybe I might
have known exactly
what I was doing.

870
00:38:33,511 --> 00:38:35,775
But the memory
never formed.

871
00:38:37,281 --> 00:38:38,680
And it never will.

872
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:43,820
Maybe the stress from
my business going
under made me snap,

873
00:38:43,888 --> 00:38:45,913
and I took it
out on her.
I don't know.

874
00:38:48,926 --> 00:38:51,486
How am I supposed
to live with that?

875
00:38:53,397 --> 00:38:54,864
I don't know.

876
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:59,663
Dalton. Dalton, can you
give me a statement
for The Ledger, please?

877
00:38:59,737 --> 00:39:01,898
FEMALE REPORTER: Do you
have anything to say
to the victim's family?

878
00:39:01,972 --> 00:39:05,135
Dalton, how does it feel
to get away with murder?

879
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:07,568
MALE REPORTER: Dalton,
you can't walk away.

880
00:39:07,645 --> 00:39:11,581
Well, at least he walked
because of the video
mix-up, and not Paxton's...

881
00:39:11,782 --> 00:39:13,647
I don't have to mention
the irony of that.

882
00:39:13,718 --> 00:39:15,185
SVU was too much
for her.

883
00:39:15,252 --> 00:39:16,879
The pressure must have
triggered her drinking.

884
00:39:16,954 --> 00:39:18,717
Explains why she was
such a control freak.

885
00:39:18,789 --> 00:39:20,814
White-knuckle drunk just
hanging on by a thread.

886
00:39:20,891 --> 00:39:22,188
What a hypocrite.

887
00:39:22,259 --> 00:39:24,227
She was a good lawyer
with a bad problem.

888
00:39:24,295 --> 00:39:26,092
I definitely saw a lot
of my mother in her.

889
00:39:26,163 --> 00:39:28,563
Well, her career's over.
There's no way
she's coming back from this.

890
00:39:28,632 --> 00:39:31,100
I mean, she's
a walking cluster...

891
00:39:37,108 --> 00:39:39,235
I couldn't have
said it better.

892
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:43,144
Though I wouldn't
have censored myself.

893
00:39:48,853 --> 00:39:51,151
I just wanted to say

894
00:39:53,157 --> 00:39:55,717
that it's been an honor
working with you.

895
00:39:55,793 --> 00:39:57,590
You taking some
personal time?

896
00:39:57,661 --> 00:39:59,253
No, no, no, no.

897
00:39:59,597 --> 00:40:02,657
I'm actually on my way
to court-ordered rehab.

898
00:40:10,007 --> 00:40:11,304
(EXHALES)

899
00:40:12,877 --> 00:40:14,868
I know that
there is no way

900
00:40:14,945 --> 00:40:18,210
that you will ever
be able to forgive me.

901
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:24,547
But I intend
to make amends

902
00:40:25,389 --> 00:40:28,722
to each and every
one of you.

903
00:40:35,132 --> 00:40:36,463
I'm sorry.
