1
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:25,221
In the criminal
justice system...

2
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:27,054
sexually based offenses

3
00:00:27,127 --> 00:00:28,890
are considered
especially heinous.

4
00:00:28,962 --> 00:00:31,226
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

5
00:00:31,297 --> 00:00:33,128
who investigate
these vicious felonies...

6
00:00:33,199 --> 00:00:34,894
are members of an elite squad

7
00:00:34,968 --> 00:00:36,663
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

8
00:00:36,736 --> 00:00:38,431
These are their stories.

9
00:00:41,474 --> 00:00:42,964
Guy's a slacker.

10
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:46,604
Didn't contribute, showed up late.
Study group didn't need the dead weight.

11
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:49,910
What'd you do? Tossed him
out on his pompous ass.

12
00:00:52,252 --> 00:00:54,345
Hey, there's that bum again.

13
00:00:54,421 --> 00:00:57,185
What's he up to? Probably
fertilizing the bushes.

14
00:00:57,257 --> 00:00:58,656
Hey, Harry.

15
00:01:00,827 --> 00:01:02,692
Where you going, Harry?

16
00:01:06,099 --> 00:01:08,397
Oh, my God.
Oh, man.

17
00:01:09,502 --> 00:01:11,732
Name's Kelly D'leah,
student at Hanford.

18
00:01:11,805 --> 00:01:15,502
Couple of joggers found her in the bushes
off the campus quad about 7:00 a. m.

19
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:17,634
Her condition?
Semi-conscious, no panties...

20
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:19,473
smell of alcohol
on her breath.

21
00:01:19,546 --> 00:01:22,379
Cordoned off the area, called
CSU. Partner's still on scene.

22
00:01:22,449 --> 00:01:25,213
What'd the doctor say?
That's him. Hey, Doc...

23
00:01:25,285 --> 00:01:27,685
Detectives Benson and
Stabler. What do we got?

24
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:30,587
She's a little vague on the
details, but has all the earmarks.

25
00:01:30,657 --> 00:01:34,149
Abrasions to knees, arms, bruising
about the pelvis and neck, hickeys.

26
00:01:34,227 --> 00:01:36,286
Rape kit turn up anything?
Haven't done it.

27
00:01:36,362 --> 00:01:39,229
Once I started the exam,
she refused to proceed.

28
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:41,733
I was hoping you might
be able to persuade her.

29
00:01:41,801 --> 00:01:42,893
Okay.

30
00:01:44,737 --> 00:01:46,568
Just a little longer.

31
00:01:51,244 --> 00:01:55,271
And that should do it.
Okay, Kelly. The exam's over.

32
00:01:56,116 --> 00:02:00,678
This is a high dose of oral
contraceptives. Birth control pills?

33
00:02:00,753 --> 00:02:02,653
The doctor found semen.

34
00:02:04,057 --> 00:02:07,584
What? The rapist didn't use a condom.

35
00:02:09,395 --> 00:02:10,760
No.

36
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,991
The pills will
prevent pregnancy.

37
00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:15,431
We'll also give you
an antibiotic for any STDs...

38
00:02:15,502 --> 00:02:18,596
that may have been transmitted. No.

39
00:02:20,607 --> 00:02:22,336
No, I can't.

40
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:25,569
You can't what, Kelly?
I can't deal with this.

41
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:27,772
Okay, sweetheart, you don't
have to decide right now.

44
00:02:32,418 --> 00:02:34,852
You don't understand...

45
00:02:36,956 --> 00:02:38,685
I'm a virgin.

46
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:35,909
Hi, I'm looking for Kelly D'leah.
They brought her in this morning.

47
00:03:35,982 --> 00:03:38,382
Are you a relative?
No, her roommate, Dana Kimble.

48
00:03:38,451 --> 00:03:40,419
I just brought her
a fresh change of clothes.

49
00:03:40,486 --> 00:03:42,181
Dana. Detective Stabler.

50
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:45,856
I came as soon as the
hospital called. How is she?

51
00:03:45,925 --> 00:03:47,017
She's still with the doctor.

52
00:03:47,093 --> 00:03:50,153
Tell you what, though. Come on
over here, I'll talk with you, okay?

53
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,755
Should be finished soon,
but in the meantime...

54
00:03:52,832 --> 00:03:54,697
do you know
where she was last night?

55
00:03:54,767 --> 00:03:58,498
She was out with Tess and Jodie,
a couple of our sorority sisters.

56
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:01,938
They said she was still partying at
the Beta Lambda house when they left.

57
00:04:02,008 --> 00:04:04,169
What time was that?
About 1:30.

58
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:08,271
They say who they left her with?
Joe Templeton and Hank Ludlow.

59
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:10,179
They friends of hers?

60
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:14,978
I wouldn't exactly call them friends,
but I know Joe had a thing for her.

61
00:04:15,054 --> 00:04:16,385
Okay, what's
that mean, "thing"?

62
00:04:16,456 --> 00:04:19,220
Ever since she shot him down
at a rush party last semester...

63
00:04:19,292 --> 00:04:21,886
he's been on her to go out
with him. Why won't she?

64
00:04:21,961 --> 00:04:24,759
She knows his type.
What type is that?

65
00:04:25,131 --> 00:04:26,393
He's a player.

66
00:04:26,799 --> 00:04:29,529
You know, she flirts with him
to tweak his ego a little bit.

67
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:30,591
Yeah?

68
00:04:31,304 --> 00:04:33,704
She knows where
to draw the line.

69
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:38,008
That's why I got worried when
she didn't come home last night.

70
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:40,605
Okay, excuse me
one second, okay?

71
00:04:42,749 --> 00:04:45,343
Doctor confirms semen
and a torn hymen.

72
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:47,682
Unfortunately, the victim's
a little vague on details.

73
00:04:47,754 --> 00:04:49,051
Blood alcohol's
still point 0.4.

74
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:52,114
Roommate said she'd been out partying
with two frat boys last night.

75
00:04:52,191 --> 00:04:55,456
Let's hope they can explain
how she wound up in the bushes.

76
00:04:56,062 --> 00:04:57,188
I got a crime scene here.

77
00:04:57,263 --> 00:04:59,163
Should we rescue Gordy
from the campus fuzz?

78
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:00,529
Better, or we'll be here
all day.

79
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,693
Look, it'll take as long
as it takes.

80
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:05,829
We need this area cleared for
pedestrians. What's the problem?

81
00:05:05,905 --> 00:05:08,567
We got 10,000 students swarming
this quad by 9:00 a. m...

82
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:11,769
and your guys are still beating the
weeds looking for God knows what.

83
00:05:11,844 --> 00:05:14,278
It's a crime scene, Barney.
They're looking for evidence.

84
00:05:14,347 --> 00:05:15,712
Name's Monroe, Detective...

85
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:17,943
and crime scene or not,
this is private property.

86
00:05:18,017 --> 00:05:19,951
The city's gonna pay
for these shrubs?

87
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:23,887
I arrest you for obstructing justice,
the university gonna pay your bail?

88
00:05:23,956 --> 00:05:26,288
Just make it quick, will you?

89
00:05:27,427 --> 00:05:28,985
What do you got?
Used condom...

90
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:31,656
handbag with the victim's
hairbrush and ID, and this scarf.

91
00:05:31,731 --> 00:05:33,358
Styling.
Bag it all.

92
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:35,492
Where are the joggers?
Up there.

93
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:40,230
I'm Detective Munch. This is
my partner, Detective Tutuola.

94
00:05:40,306 --> 00:05:43,969
We understand you found her. She
was laying down in the bushes.

95
00:05:44,377 --> 00:05:47,039
At first, I thought she was
dead, then I heard her moaning.

96
00:05:47,113 --> 00:05:50,480
She say anything?
A name. Josh, or John.

97
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,814
It was hard to make out.
Anybody else around?

98
00:05:52,885 --> 00:05:55,376
Just this little creep
who loiters around campus.

99
00:05:55,455 --> 00:05:56,649
What's he look like?

100
00:05:56,723 --> 00:05:58,850
Greasy hair,
wears an old army coat.

101
00:05:58,925 --> 00:06:02,884
Took off the minute he spotted
us. Where can we find this guy?

102
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:10,534
Want some syrup with
those flapjacks there, slappy?

103
00:06:22,849 --> 00:06:24,749
I didn't do anything.

104
00:06:24,817 --> 00:06:27,684
Why'd you run?
You were chasing me.

105
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:36,224
You Kelly D'leah?
No, it's Harry.

106
00:06:36,295 --> 00:06:40,095
Harry, you're under arrest for
possession of stolen property.

107
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:41,758
So take us through it, Kelly.

108
00:06:41,834 --> 00:06:46,635
Jodie, Tess, and I left the house about
9:30 and headed to the Kollege Keg...

109
00:06:46,806 --> 00:06:48,068
a bar near campus.

110
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:50,405
Is that where you met up
with Joe and Hank?

111
00:06:50,476 --> 00:06:53,070
Yeah, they invited us to
join them at a booth.

112
00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:55,275
How long did you stay?

113
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:58,613
An hour, maybe two.
Then what happened?

114
00:06:58,818 --> 00:07:02,083
We went to the Beta house to
play video games in Joe's room.

115
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:03,882
Tell us about Joe.

116
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:07,359
Not much to tell.
Typical frat rat.

117
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:10,362
Your roommate said
that he had a thing for you.

118
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:13,391
We flirted,
but it's not serious.

119
00:07:13,466 --> 00:07:16,435
What about Hank?
You gotta be kidding me.

120
00:07:16,502 --> 00:07:20,097
Did either one of these guys
make sexual advances toward you?

121
00:07:20,673 --> 00:07:24,541
Not more than usual,
but we were just having fun.

122
00:07:26,679 --> 00:07:29,011
How much
did you have to drink?

123
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:33,875
One or two glasses
of margaritas.

124
00:07:34,487 --> 00:07:36,182
A few sips of beer
at the house.

125
00:07:36,255 --> 00:07:39,019
What's the last thing
that you remember that night?

126
00:07:39,091 --> 00:07:43,721
We were all sitting on the
floor, talking, laughing...

127
00:07:44,063 --> 00:07:48,932
and after that, it gets fuzzy.
What do you mean, "fuzzy?"

128
00:07:52,004 --> 00:07:53,869
I remember feeling cold...

129
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:57,408
and someone
pulling on my hair.

130
00:07:58,511 --> 00:08:00,206
But then, nothing.

131
00:08:02,381 --> 00:08:06,181
I didn't think that I was drinking
that much, but I must have been.

132
00:08:06,252 --> 00:08:09,312
This wouldn't have happened
if I wasn't, right?

133
00:08:11,357 --> 00:08:13,291
Oh, God, what did I do?

134
00:08:17,864 --> 00:08:19,855
What did I do?

135
00:08:23,803 --> 00:08:27,261
Stellar bio you got here,
Harry. Petty theft, vagrancy.

136
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:30,639
Even pinched a couple of times for
window shopping at the girl's dorm.

137
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:33,702
I never hurt anybody.
So, why you taking souvenirs?

138
00:08:33,813 --> 00:08:35,781
Found them in the bushes.

139
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:39,045
I was on my way to lost
and found to turn them in.

140
00:08:39,785 --> 00:08:42,276
Since when is lost and found
in a dumpster?

141
00:08:42,788 --> 00:08:45,279
I had to eat first.
Come again?

142
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:48,327
Breakfast leftovers,
they get tossed by 11:00.

143
00:08:49,328 --> 00:08:52,422
Wanted to get my eats
while they were still hot.

144
00:08:53,065 --> 00:08:55,329
You think this is a joke?
No.

145
00:08:56,068 --> 00:08:57,330
No joke.

146
00:08:58,271 --> 00:09:00,671
I go there everyday.
Not anymore.

147
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,731
We got you on possession
of stolen property.

148
00:09:02,808 --> 00:09:06,869
And we're a blood test away from
nailing your little scruffy ass for rape.

149
00:09:07,113 --> 00:09:10,640
Should've used a condom, Harry.
Please, I can't stand needles.

150
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,548
No needles, please. Then
look, come at us straight...

151
00:09:13,619 --> 00:09:15,814
and maybe we can work
something out.

152
00:09:17,123 --> 00:09:18,215
All right.

153
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:24,753
I was making my rounds...

154
00:09:25,131 --> 00:09:27,031
she came out of the house.

155
00:09:27,633 --> 00:09:29,624
What house?
Frat house.

156
00:09:30,703 --> 00:09:34,969
She was all wobbly, like
she was drunk. What time?

157
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:39,501
Sun wasn't up, but it was
getting light. I followed her.

158
00:09:41,213 --> 00:09:44,376
She fell down a few times,
got up.

159
00:09:44,684 --> 00:09:48,780
Last time, she stayed down.
I went over.

160
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:51,117
She was out cold.

161
00:09:52,191 --> 00:09:53,954
I took the money...

162
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,091
the cards.

163
00:09:57,196 --> 00:10:00,791
I never raped anybody.

164
00:10:04,904 --> 00:10:06,667
You sons of bitches.

165
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:10,732
You said I wouldn't have to take
a needle. Yeah, well, we lied.

166
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:12,103
What do you think?

167
00:10:12,178 --> 00:10:14,305
If he was moving his way up
the food chain...

168
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:16,871
from peeping Tom to rapist, she
would have been an easy mark.

169
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:19,349
On the other hand, if his blood
test comes back negative...

170
00:10:19,418 --> 00:10:21,978
we're back to square one.
What did you find at the scene?

171
00:10:22,054 --> 00:10:25,820
Usual collegiate artifacts, used condom.
But since the rapist left semen...

172
00:10:25,891 --> 00:10:28,291
Test it anyway. What
about the missing panties?

173
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:31,353
Still missing. Along with
about six hours of memory.

174
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:33,364
All right, talk to
her party companions.

175
00:10:33,432 --> 00:10:36,731
See if we can start filling
in some of that missing time.

176
00:10:39,538 --> 00:10:41,472
We got to the house
about 11:00.

177
00:10:41,741 --> 00:10:43,208
What'd you do once
you got there?

178
00:10:43,275 --> 00:10:45,573
We went to Joe's room to play
strip poker on his computer.

179
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:48,307
You been drinking?
We were all pretty happy.

180
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:51,111
But, Kelly was pretty loose.
Really? How loose?

181
00:10:51,183 --> 00:10:54,209
She was hanging all over Joe,
making a fool of herself.

182
00:10:54,286 --> 00:10:56,584
But what else is new?
That happen a lot?

183
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,817
She was always glued
on somebody.

184
00:10:58,891 --> 00:11:01,519
How long were you at the
Beta house? For a while.

185
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:04,119
But when Kelly stripped down
to her bra and panties...

186
00:11:04,196 --> 00:11:06,391
Tess and I decided
to call it a night.

187
00:11:06,465 --> 00:11:08,763
You guys just left her there?

188
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:11,166
She was giving Joe
a lap dance.

189
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:14,371
And Joe?
He was lapping it up.

190
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,907
Wouldn't you?

191
00:11:16,609 --> 00:11:17,871
Yeah, she had the hot ticket.

192
00:11:17,943 --> 00:11:21,879
And I'd have been happy to punch it for her
if she hadn't have puked all over the floor.

193
00:11:21,947 --> 00:11:25,075
Kind of put the old muzzle on Mr.
Happy, if you know what I mean.

194
00:11:25,151 --> 00:11:27,346
Anybody witness
this fateful hurl?

195
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:30,651
Yeah, sure. We set up
bleachers and charged admission.

196
00:11:31,123 --> 00:11:34,115
What did you do after the wind
went out of your little sail?

197
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:38,220
I left her on my bed to sleep it off. And
I went downstairs to crash on the sofa.

198
00:11:38,297 --> 00:11:40,288
I was in the TV room
watching wrestling...

199
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:43,631
and Joe came in, threw me a blanket.
Told me we were sleeping there.

200
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:46,501
You know, luckily, I had a good
buzz on. I passed out on the floor.

201
00:11:46,572 --> 00:11:48,972
And you got no idea how Kelly
wound up in the bushes?

202
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:51,202
Look, man, I don't know
what this chick told you...

203
00:11:51,277 --> 00:11:53,609
but I heard she worked her way
through the Kappa Sigs...

204
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:56,648
before setting her sights
on Joe. So she had it coming?

205
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:57,740
I didn't say that.

206
00:11:57,817 --> 00:12:01,218
But I can tell you for a fact
that it wasn't Joe or me.

207
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:04,922
Harry's blood type
doesn't match the semen.

208
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:06,423
Any luck with her friends?

209
00:12:06,492 --> 00:12:09,757
According to her sorority sisters,
she was making all the moves.

210
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:12,195
I thought she was a virgin.
Technically.

211
00:12:12,264 --> 00:12:15,700
Word on campus was, she was doing a
lot of practicing for her oral exam.

212
00:12:15,768 --> 00:12:17,827
So she deserves to be raped?

213
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:19,837
We don't even know
if those rumors are true.

214
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:21,896
Yeah, but witnesses said
she came on to Joe.

215
00:12:21,974 --> 00:12:25,876
No, witnesses said she flirted. A lap
dance sends a pretty strong signal.

216
00:12:25,945 --> 00:12:27,105
She was drunk.
So was he.

217
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:28,237
So that excuses him?

218
00:12:28,314 --> 00:12:30,339
No, but her behavior's
open to interpretation.

219
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:33,544
She might have played it out and woke
up with a case of buyer's remorse.

220
00:12:33,619 --> 00:12:36,417
So now we're blaming the
victim? Nobody is blaming her...

221
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:40,084
but we all know how hard it is to get
an indictment on a he-said, she-said...

222
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:41,922
even without the ambiguities.

223
00:12:41,994 --> 00:12:43,052
That was the lab.

224
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:46,963
Tox screen just came back. They
found traces of GHB in Kelly's urine.

225
00:12:47,032 --> 00:12:49,159
So much for the ambiguities.

226
00:12:49,401 --> 00:12:52,495
Only one reason to slip
someone a date rape drug.

227
00:12:52,571 --> 00:12:55,836
Find out who spiked her drink,
you find the rapist.

228
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:59,677
I met with
the dean of students.

229
00:12:59,745 --> 00:13:01,645
She said if I don't
press criminal charges...

230
00:13:01,714 --> 00:13:04,012
she can have the university's
disciplinary committee...

231
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:05,983
handle my case
without a public trial.

232
00:13:06,051 --> 00:13:09,418
Rape is a criminal offense.
What if it was my fault?

233
00:13:09,855 --> 00:13:12,085
Jodie and Tess said I was
half naked when they left.

234
00:13:12,158 --> 00:13:13,216
I don't even remember.

235
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:15,954
That's because they found GHB
in your system.

236
00:13:16,028 --> 00:13:17,586
What's GHB?

237
00:13:17,663 --> 00:13:20,223
It's a drug
that reduces inhibitions.

238
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:23,097
The vomiting and the chills
were side effects.

239
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:25,194
You could have died, Kelly.

240
00:13:25,271 --> 00:13:26,636
But I didn't take anything.

241
00:13:26,705 --> 00:13:28,764
Somebody probably
slipped it into your drink.

242
00:13:28,841 --> 00:13:32,299
Whoever did this to you took away
your ability to consent to have sex.

243
00:13:32,378 --> 00:13:33,606
He raped you.

244
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:38,640
Who? That's what we're
trying to find out.

245
00:13:38,884 --> 00:13:41,011
But we need you to help us.

246
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:44,081
You said you were drinking
margaritas at the bar.

247
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:46,488
You ever leave
your drink unattended?

248
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:49,995
Joe and I got up to dance, and
I went to the restroom once.

249
00:13:50,062 --> 00:13:53,429
But both times, I left my glass
on the table with everybody else's.

250
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:56,525
How'd you feel when you left?
Fine, I guess.

251
00:13:56,602 --> 00:14:00,003
You go straight to the frat
house? Had a beer there?

252
00:14:00,606 --> 00:14:02,130
They kept pouring more
into my glass.

253
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:05,109
But, that's when I started
to feel dizzy, so I stopped.

254
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:08,772
Did anybody else join you at the
frat, once you got to Joe's room?

255
00:14:09,148 --> 00:14:10,843
Wally Parker.

256
00:14:11,383 --> 00:14:12,782
Who's Wally Parker?

257
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:15,685
One of the brothers.
But he didn't stay long.

258
00:14:15,754 --> 00:14:17,984
So, that leaves
Hank and Joe.

259
00:14:18,757 --> 00:14:20,816
You think it's one of them?
We don't know...

260
00:14:20,893 --> 00:14:24,260
but for now, why don't we just keep
this conversation between us, okay?

261
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:27,163
If anything turns up,
we'll let you know.

262
00:14:31,837 --> 00:14:34,397
You know how many frat rats
come in here every night?

263
00:14:34,473 --> 00:14:35,997
I wonder how many of them
are underage.

264
00:14:36,075 --> 00:14:39,567
Suppose we send in
an undercover team and see.

265
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:43,238
It's the Babe.
Who?

266
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:45,344
Bets me $20
against a free beer...

267
00:14:45,417 --> 00:14:47,510
that he can call a home run
at the top of the night...

268
00:14:47,586 --> 00:14:49,713
like Babe Ruth
in the World Series.

269
00:14:49,788 --> 00:14:53,155
Points out a girl,
if he bags her, he wins.

270
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:56,717
What's his batting average? He
drinks a lot more than he pays.

271
00:14:57,663 --> 00:15:00,063
He ever take a swing
at this one?

272
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:02,595
The other night.

273
00:15:02,668 --> 00:15:04,397
She walked in with
a couple other hotties.

274
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:06,461
Joe was sitting here
with his sidekick. Hank?

275
00:15:06,538 --> 00:15:08,597
Yeah. Joe picked her out
and laid down his bet.

276
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:11,666
Only this time,
bets me $50 against a pitcher.

277
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:14,508
Getting cocky?
Ain't cocky if you deliver.

278
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,571
Did he deliver with this one?

279
00:15:17,716 --> 00:15:19,946
Half hour later,
he's walking her out the door.

280
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:22,920
I'm telling you, guy's got
an eye for the long ball.

281
00:15:26,725 --> 00:15:28,818
Yes, I spoke to Miss D'leah
this morning...

282
00:15:28,894 --> 00:15:30,384
and I gave her
my full support.

283
00:15:30,462 --> 00:15:32,794
But you tried to talk her out
of pressing criminal charges.

284
00:15:32,865 --> 00:15:35,561
I gave her an alternative
to criminal proceedings.

285
00:15:35,634 --> 00:15:36,896
The decision is hers.

286
00:15:36,969 --> 00:15:39,836
How exactly does this disciplinary
committee of yours work?

287
00:15:39,905 --> 00:15:43,602
It's composed of three
students and three faculty.

288
00:15:43,676 --> 00:15:46,839
Each presents their case, along
with three other witnesses...

289
00:15:46,912 --> 00:15:49,676
then the committee deliberates
and renders a decision.

290
00:15:49,748 --> 00:15:51,739
What kind of sentences
do you hand down for rape?

291
00:15:51,817 --> 00:15:54,911
Since we don't have criminal
jurisdiction, we can't incarcerate.

292
00:15:54,987 --> 00:15:57,785
However, we can suspend,
and, if warranted, expel.

293
00:15:57,856 --> 00:16:01,724
Has Joe Templeton or Hank Ludlow been
involved in a case like this before?

294
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,284
I'm not at liberty to say.

295
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:07,321
Dean Richter, you realize we're talking
about a girl who's been drugged and raped.

296
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:09,094
I'm not unsympathetic.

297
00:16:09,168 --> 00:16:11,432
However, I cannot release
a student's private records...

298
00:16:11,503 --> 00:16:14,199
unless I have written
permission, or a court order.

299
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:20,434
Sometimes the thought of Maureen in
college scares the hell out of me.

300
00:16:20,512 --> 00:16:21,570
I don't blame you.

301
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:24,639
Higher education used to mean
B.A. s and Ph. D.s.

302
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,650
Now it's roofies and GHB.

303
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:29,916
And deans with confidential
disciplinary committees.

304
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:33,015
It's an extension of the loco
parentis role of the university.

305
00:16:33,192 --> 00:16:35,057
They prefer to keep
these matters in house...

306
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:37,095
to save the students
the ordeal of a public trial.

307
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:39,460
And to relieve the school
of any public embarrassment.

308
00:16:39,531 --> 00:16:42,796
The dean definitely did not feel
comfortable playing public relations...

309
00:16:42,868 --> 00:16:45,996
which makes me think those student
records are gonna tell us a story.

310
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:47,698
What'll it take to
get those records?

311
00:16:47,773 --> 00:16:50,571
The university will quash a
subpoena without more evidence.

312
00:16:50,642 --> 00:16:53,668
Evidence. No evidence
without those records.

313
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:55,145
Hell of a catch-22.

314
00:16:55,214 --> 00:16:58,672
If this guy is a sexual predator,
chances are he's left other victims.

315
00:16:58,751 --> 00:17:01,345
If we establish a pattern,
we've got our probable cause.

316
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:02,614
Any suggestions?

317
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:05,623
Fin and I made friends with a guy
in the campus police department.

318
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:07,591
We did?
Nick, the campus dick.

319
00:17:07,659 --> 00:17:10,822
Maybe, we can appeal to his fraternal
sense of brotherhood among cops.

320
00:17:10,896 --> 00:17:13,456
Kelly also mentioned a third
guy that was in Joe's room.

321
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:14,624
Maybe he's worth a shot.

322
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:18,158
Tell you what, at this point,
anything's worth a shot.

323
00:17:18,504 --> 00:17:20,904
All right, I'll see you later.
Wally Parker?

324
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:22,770
Can I talk to you a minute?

325
00:17:23,142 --> 00:17:25,804
Is this about Kelly? We heard
you were there the other night.

326
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:29,006
Not for long. I had a philosophy
exam, so I left to study.

327
00:17:29,081 --> 00:17:32,949
Now, before you left, did you
have any interaction with Kelly?

328
00:17:33,285 --> 00:17:35,219
What do you mean?
You talk with her?

329
00:17:35,287 --> 00:17:36,549
A little.

330
00:17:37,423 --> 00:17:39,550
She seem lucid to you
at the time?

331
00:17:39,925 --> 00:17:42,359
She was partying.
Was she dressed?

332
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:43,520
Yeah.

333
00:17:45,431 --> 00:17:48,127
Anything seem out of
whack to you? Like what?

334
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,468
You tell me.

335
00:17:53,338 --> 00:17:56,307
You either talk to us here,
or you talk to us downtown.

336
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:59,401
Because right now we got you
pegged as an accomplice...

337
00:17:59,478 --> 00:18:03,847
so you'll have plenty of time to test the
bonds of brotherhood in criminal court.

338
00:18:06,985 --> 00:18:10,580
About 1:00, I went downstairs
for a drink of water...

339
00:18:10,656 --> 00:18:14,854
I saw Hank and Joe
sacked out in the TV room.

340
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:19,955
And when I went back upstairs, she
was in Joe's room by herself, crying.

341
00:18:20,032 --> 00:18:22,262
Over what?
She wouldn't say.

342
00:18:22,734 --> 00:18:25,999
Her hair was messed up, and
there was vomit on the floor.

343
00:18:26,071 --> 00:18:28,266
She looked like
she needed a friend.

344
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:31,407
I offered to walk her home,
and by the time I got my coat...

345
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:33,240
she was already gone.

346
00:18:34,146 --> 00:18:35,545
Back to bust my chops?

347
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:37,343
Actually, we came
to apologize.

348
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:39,646
We might have been a little
harsh with you the other day.

349
00:18:39,718 --> 00:18:41,652
You know how it is,
boss breathing down our necks.

350
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:45,019
Bad day all around. We're
not all windup cops, you know.

351
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:47,183
I'm finishing my criminology
degree next month...

352
00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:49,489
and applying to the Feds.
My cousin's a G-man.

353
00:18:49,561 --> 00:18:52,086
I could put in a good word
as a professional courtesy.

354
00:18:52,164 --> 00:18:54,724
Why don't you tell me
why you're really here?

355
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:58,234
We need some information on a student
who may have caused you problems.

356
00:18:58,303 --> 00:18:59,861
Who?
Joe Templeton.

357
00:18:59,938 --> 00:19:02,270
You make him for the
doer in that rape? Maybe.

358
00:19:02,341 --> 00:19:03,774
We'd like to pull
his records...

359
00:19:03,842 --> 00:19:07,039
but we're having problems getting
past the gatekeeper in the ivory tower.

360
00:19:07,112 --> 00:19:10,411
And you want me to ignore university
policy to help you make your case?

361
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:13,110
We want you
to help us nail a rapist.

362
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:18,888
Off the record,
the guy's a piece of work.

363
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:22,518
In fact, I take more calls on that
house than any other frat on campus.

364
00:19:22,594 --> 00:19:23,618
What's his deal?

365
00:19:23,695 --> 00:19:26,357
Last semester, a woman on the
swim team claimed he raped her.

366
00:19:26,431 --> 00:19:27,898
Why isn't he in our system?

367
00:19:27,966 --> 00:19:30,833
She pressed charges through the
university's disciplinary board.

368
00:19:30,903 --> 00:19:32,302
Any details?

369
00:19:32,738 --> 00:19:35,673
Templeton got her drunk, did
her while she was in a stupor.

370
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:42,408
Mandy Schumacher?
Yes.

371
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:45,211
I'm Detective Munch. This is
my partner, Detective Tutuola.

372
00:19:45,284 --> 00:19:47,252
Can we talk?
Sure.

373
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:50,183
It was a rush party.

374
00:19:50,422 --> 00:19:53,152
He started hitting on me
the minute I walked in.

375
00:19:53,792 --> 00:19:56,693
We danced,
and I had a lot to drink.

376
00:19:57,062 --> 00:19:59,963
The only thing I remember is him
on top of me, pulling my hair.

377
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:01,659
I must have blacked out.

378
00:20:01,733 --> 00:20:05,260
Next morning, I woke up
with these God-awful hickeys.

379
00:20:05,337 --> 00:20:07,601
I don't even know
how I got home.

380
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:11,274
If you blacked out, how
did you know you were raped?

381
00:20:11,343 --> 00:20:12,469
I didn't...

382
00:20:12,778 --> 00:20:15,941
until a few weeks later, when
I found out I was pregnant.

383
00:20:16,148 --> 00:20:19,447
I did the math.
It had to be him.

384
00:20:20,452 --> 00:20:23,148
I ended up getting an
abortion. What else could I do?

385
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:25,452
Why didn't you call
the police?

386
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:28,885
I spoke with my advisor
and a lawyer.

387
00:20:29,828 --> 00:20:31,921
Both agreed that I didn't have
much of a case...

388
00:20:31,997 --> 00:20:35,694
since there was no evidence,
and I couldn't remember anything.

389
00:20:35,767 --> 00:20:38,258
So I filed a complaint
with the review board.

390
00:20:38,337 --> 00:20:41,602
They found him guilty of
conduct unbecoming a student.

391
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:45,168
He got put on probation
for one academic semester.

392
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:47,678
You run into him since?

393
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:50,681
Yeah, we see each other
on campus from time to time.

394
00:20:50,882 --> 00:20:52,713
He even tried to ask me out.

395
00:20:53,452 --> 00:20:54,714
I slapped him.

396
00:20:55,654 --> 00:20:59,215
Now he just snickers when he
passes by with his buddies.

397
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:03,423
It's like being raped
all over again.

398
00:21:07,399 --> 00:21:09,629
Final labs
from Kelly's rape kit.

399
00:21:09,701 --> 00:21:12,966
In addition to semen, the rapist
left behind another little gift.

400
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:15,370
Gonorrhea.
The gift that keeps on giving.

401
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,273
He either doesn't know
he has it, or doesn't care.

402
00:21:18,343 --> 00:21:19,503
How could he not know?

403
00:21:19,578 --> 00:21:22,240
Some carriers
don't show obvious symptoms.

404
00:21:22,314 --> 00:21:24,111
Which means he could have
infected others.

405
00:21:24,182 --> 00:21:25,376
Or still may.

406
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:27,975
We tie Joe to the GHB,
we can arrest him.

407
00:21:28,053 --> 00:21:30,385
We got enough for a
search warrant? Not yet.

408
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:33,049
But we've got enough to secure
a subpoena for his records.

409
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,116
And if those records
bear out Mandy's testimony...

410
00:21:35,193 --> 00:21:37,718
that'll give us a
search warrant. Let's go.

411
00:21:39,097 --> 00:21:42,828
I'm sorry, Robert, I'll call you
back. There's your court order...

412
00:21:42,901 --> 00:21:45,392
directing you to turn over
any personal, academic...

413
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:48,337
and disciplinary files
for the individuals listed.

414
00:21:49,374 --> 00:21:51,569
You can't just walk in here
and invade their privacy.

415
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:53,770
They're not even home.
We can and we are.

416
00:21:53,845 --> 00:21:57,144
Sir, please.
Get out of our way, squirt.

417
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:01,646
Okay, look what we got here.
Hey.

418
00:22:02,387 --> 00:22:05,356
Blood stains. Didn't
bother to change the sheets.

419
00:22:05,724 --> 00:22:06,713
Guys...

420
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:10,659
could be the mother lode.

421
00:22:10,729 --> 00:22:13,892
I'll take it to the lab, we'll
have an answer in an hour.

422
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,964
See these graphic representations? Yeah.

423
00:22:18,036 --> 00:22:21,301
Each color represents a chemical
with a specific refraction rate.

424
00:22:21,373 --> 00:22:23,933
The graph on the left shows
the breakdown of the GHB...

425
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:25,943
extracted from
the victim's urine.

426
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:29,572
The graph on the right represents
the sample taken from the eyedropper.

427
00:22:29,648 --> 00:22:31,707
What do you see?
They look the same.

428
00:22:31,783 --> 00:22:33,375
That's because they are.

429
00:22:33,452 --> 00:22:36,615
The chemical composition of
the two samples is identical.

430
00:22:36,788 --> 00:22:39,416
We find out who made it, we
find out who drugged our victim.

431
00:22:39,491 --> 00:22:41,959
Right. How do you
make this stuff?

432
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:43,961
The GHB tends
to be home-brewed.

433
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:47,362
Often using cleaning solvent or
paint remover as base compounds.

434
00:22:47,432 --> 00:22:50,026
But this batch
is uncommonly pure.

435
00:22:50,102 --> 00:22:52,730
Whoever cooked it
had access to a lab.

436
00:22:52,971 --> 00:22:54,199
Thanks.

437
00:22:56,475 --> 00:22:58,033
Joe's been a busy guy.

438
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:01,568
Every one of Mandy's witnesses
against Joe has a story to tell...

439
00:23:01,646 --> 00:23:02,738
none of them flattering.

440
00:23:02,814 --> 00:23:06,181
Gets them drunk, lures them to his
room, the hair pulling, the hickeys.

441
00:23:06,251 --> 00:23:07,912
It's like he's following
a play book.

442
00:23:07,986 --> 00:23:10,318
According to this, he offered
up only two witnesses...

443
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:11,378
in his defense.

444
00:23:11,456 --> 00:23:15,187
Hank Ludlow, and his own
father, Joseph Templeton Sr.

445
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:17,820
Now, what's his father doing
at a rush party?

446
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:20,154
Character witness only.

447
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:22,359
Guy must have some heft
with the university.

448
00:23:22,434 --> 00:23:23,560
Here we go.

449
00:23:23,769 --> 00:23:25,794
Mentions a chair he endowed
at the law school.

450
00:23:25,871 --> 00:23:28,271
Head of an alumni committee,
overseeing a building fund.

451
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:30,638
No wonder little Joey got off
with a slap on the wrist.

452
00:23:30,709 --> 00:23:32,870
Not this time. Go.

453
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:36,813
Hank Ludlow...

454
00:23:36,882 --> 00:23:40,943
you're under arrest for possession
of GHB, a controlled substance.

455
00:23:45,724 --> 00:23:47,055
Joe Templeton...

456
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:49,553
put your hands right there.

457
00:23:49,628 --> 00:23:54,065
You're under arrest for possession
of GHB and the rape of Kelly D'leah.

458
00:23:54,332 --> 00:23:55,822
This is ridiculous.

459
00:23:55,901 --> 00:23:57,368
You have the right
to remain silent...

460
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:59,631
and refuse to answer any
questions. Do you understand?

461
00:23:59,704 --> 00:24:02,935
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

462
00:24:03,008 --> 00:24:06,603
You have the right to an attorney. If
you cannot afford one, one will be...

463
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:13,478
I demand to see my son.

464
00:24:14,085 --> 00:24:17,680
I'm sorry, Mr. Templeton, but he's
in with the detectives right now.

465
00:24:17,756 --> 00:24:20,520
I'm his father.
I have a right to be with him.

466
00:24:20,592 --> 00:24:24,119
He's an adult under the law, and in
point of fact, you don't have that right.

467
00:24:24,196 --> 00:24:25,629
Do you want me
to go over your head?

468
00:24:25,697 --> 00:24:28,666
I'm not some college provost
you can intimidate with threats.

469
00:24:28,733 --> 00:24:31,395
Now you wanna gun for me, sir,
you give it your best shot.

470
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:34,098
But it won't help
your son one damn bit.

471
00:24:41,613 --> 00:24:43,706
You have children, Captain?

472
00:24:44,115 --> 00:24:45,104
No.

473
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:48,513
I just want him to know that he
doesn't have to go through this alone.

474
00:24:48,587 --> 00:24:50,214
Then be there for him.

475
00:24:50,455 --> 00:24:53,583
But in the eyes of the law, Joe is
responsible for his own actions...

476
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:56,923
and this time, he's gonna have
to stand on his own two feet.

477
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,791
The eyedropper
was a cute idea.

478
00:25:04,202 --> 00:25:05,464
It's not mine.

479
00:25:05,537 --> 00:25:08,028
Then how did it
end up in your waste basket?

480
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:11,301
I have no idea.
And the girl's underwear?

481
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:16,273
I already told you that she slept in
my bed. And her blood on your sheets?

482
00:25:17,883 --> 00:25:18,907
I can't help you.

483
00:25:18,984 --> 00:25:20,884
The urine sample
you gave already has.

484
00:25:20,952 --> 00:25:23,011
It tested positive
for gonorrhea.

485
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:24,947
What? No.

486
00:25:25,924 --> 00:25:28,984
No, I don't have gonorrhea.
Yeah. Yeah, you do.

487
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,390
And since Kelly was a virgin
before you raped her...

488
00:25:31,463 --> 00:25:34,023
we know that she got it from
you. Circumstantial, at best.

489
00:25:34,099 --> 00:25:35,589
It's good enough
for an indictment.

490
00:25:35,667 --> 00:25:38,033
And if his DNA matches
the semen from the rape kit...

491
00:25:38,103 --> 00:25:41,004
he'll be transferring to a campus
upstate. You understand that?

492
00:25:41,072 --> 00:25:43,597
Assuming you can get a court
order for the blood test.

493
00:25:43,675 --> 00:25:46,041
Please. We both know that
that's just a formality.

494
00:25:46,111 --> 00:25:47,510
Nevertheless...

495
00:25:47,579 --> 00:25:51,743
we'll wait for the results of that
formality before responding to your charges.

496
00:25:51,816 --> 00:25:52,805
Let's go.

497
00:25:52,984 --> 00:25:55,179
Possession of GHB is
a schedule one offense.

498
00:25:55,253 --> 00:25:57,813
With your past record...
What past record?

499
00:25:57,889 --> 00:26:00,255
The juvie hit for
possession of ecstasy.

500
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:04,889
That record was expunged after my
client finished his community service.

501
00:26:04,963 --> 00:26:08,763
It was expunged on the condition that
he keep his nose clean until he was 21.

502
00:26:08,833 --> 00:26:10,027
Your client's only 19.

503
00:26:10,101 --> 00:26:12,695
We'll start with possession,
move to acting in concert...

504
00:26:12,771 --> 00:26:14,295
top it off with rape.

505
00:26:14,372 --> 00:26:16,306
Wait a minute.
Enough with the scare tactics.

506
00:26:16,374 --> 00:26:19,172
What are you offering?
What are you selling?

507
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:24,715
I never saw the stuff.
How did it get in your room?

508
00:26:24,783 --> 00:26:25,807
I don't know.

509
00:26:25,884 --> 00:26:28,182
But Tess and Jodie were
acting weird all night.

510
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:32,012
They kept topping off Kelly's
beer, and calling it a love potion.

511
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:34,320
I thought they were just
trying to get her drunk.

512
00:26:34,392 --> 00:26:36,326
Is your roommate in on this?

513
00:26:38,396 --> 00:26:39,385
Yeah.

514
00:26:40,899 --> 00:26:42,696
All I know is...

515
00:26:43,468 --> 00:26:44,628
after the girls left...

516
00:26:44,703 --> 00:26:47,797
Joe tossed me a blanket
and told me to hit the bricks.

517
00:26:47,872 --> 00:26:50,466
Said he was about to hit
another home run.

518
00:26:52,844 --> 00:26:55,711
According to Hank, Joe spent at
least a half hour alone with Kelly...

519
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,338
before he went
downstairs to crash.

520
00:26:57,415 --> 00:27:00,816
His statement also implies a conspiracy
between Kelly's sorority sisters...

521
00:27:00,885 --> 00:27:02,682
for which we have no motive
and no proof.

522
00:27:02,754 --> 00:27:05,279
Why would her own sorority
sisters set her up to be raped?

523
00:27:05,357 --> 00:27:07,188
Exactly what
the grand jury's gonna ask.

524
00:27:07,258 --> 00:27:09,920
We don't supply an answer,
our whole case looks suspect.

525
00:27:09,995 --> 00:27:11,053
If they are involved...

526
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:14,030
Tess and Jodie are not gonna be
very forthcoming with a motive.

527
00:27:14,099 --> 00:27:16,124
But I know someone who might.

528
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:20,969
Kelly and Tess didn't get
along very well at first.

529
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:23,837
In fact, Tess tried to get
Kelly dinged during pledge week.

530
00:27:23,908 --> 00:27:24,932
"Dinged"?

531
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:27,342
Rejected by the membership.
Why?

532
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:33,576
Look, Dana, I understand that
your sisters are pressuring you...

533
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:35,950
but your friend was
drugged and raped.

534
00:27:36,021 --> 00:27:38,046
Now you need to decide
what's more important...

535
00:27:38,123 --> 00:27:40,853
living with them,
or living with yourself.

536
00:27:42,727 --> 00:27:45,195
Joe and Tess
were dating last semester.

537
00:27:45,597 --> 00:27:47,531
Kelly was new.
She didn't know.

538
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:50,659
When Joe checked her out at a
rush party, she flirted back.

539
00:27:50,735 --> 00:27:52,828
Tess was furious.

540
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:55,162
When Joe dumped her,
she blamed Kelly.

541
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:58,073
Tess the type of person
to hold a grudge?

542
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:01,536
A few weeks ago, I heard her
and Jodie in the bathroom.

543
00:28:01,613 --> 00:28:03,638
Tess found out
she had the clap.

544
00:28:03,715 --> 00:28:05,239
She get it from Joe?

545
00:28:05,617 --> 00:28:06,811
They were whispering.

546
00:28:06,885 --> 00:28:09,445
All I heard was something
about getting even.

547
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:11,580
Things got a little strange
after that.

548
00:28:11,656 --> 00:28:13,715
She started acting
really friendly towards Kelly.

549
00:28:13,792 --> 00:28:16,124
You know, even offered
to be her big sister.

550
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:18,185
But behind her back,
she was spreading rumors...

551
00:28:18,263 --> 00:28:20,094
about Kelly and how
she was sleeping around.

552
00:28:20,165 --> 00:28:22,395
Tess ever mentioned anything
about drugs?

553
00:28:22,467 --> 00:28:23,491
No.

554
00:28:23,568 --> 00:28:26,469
Did you ever see her or Jodie
handling a clear substance...

555
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:28,267
possibly in an eyedropper?

556
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:31,768
I saw them mixing chemicals
in their room.

557
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:34,807
When was that?

558
00:28:35,847 --> 00:28:37,610
The night before
they went out.

559
00:28:37,682 --> 00:28:38,842
It looked like homework.

560
00:28:38,917 --> 00:28:41,818
Tess was reading
from her biochem notebook.

561
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:49,553
That's Tess's station.
Open it.

562
00:28:54,933 --> 00:28:56,491
Bag everything.

563
00:28:57,635 --> 00:28:59,068
What are you doing?

564
00:28:59,137 --> 00:29:01,128
Lab TA said some items
are missing from storage,

565
00:29:01,206 --> 00:29:02,867
we thought they might
have been...

566
00:29:02,941 --> 00:29:06,308
misplaced in your drawer here.
Perhaps you could save us the trouble.

567
00:29:13,651 --> 00:29:16,484
You been out for a little jog?
What are you doing in my room?

568
00:29:16,554 --> 00:29:18,715
It's all in the warrant.

569
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:20,917
This is harassment.
So sue me.

570
00:29:20,992 --> 00:29:23,017
You're a biochem major, aren't you? So?

571
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:27,463
So, how about educating us to what the
scientific name for this little formula is?

572
00:29:28,733 --> 00:29:29,961
Well?

573
00:29:31,035 --> 00:29:34,562
Tess, possession is
just the beginning.

574
00:29:34,639 --> 00:29:37,130
Now we prove conspiracy,
you're looking at rape.

575
00:29:37,208 --> 00:29:39,972
Rape? You took away
her ability to consent.

576
00:29:40,044 --> 00:29:41,671
You'll never prove that.
No?

577
00:29:41,746 --> 00:29:45,045
One of your sorority sisters already
decided to break the code of silence.

578
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:48,108
Told us how Joe gave you the clap
before he dumped you for Kelly.

579
00:29:48,186 --> 00:29:50,814
I mean, what better way to
get back at the little tease...

580
00:29:50,889 --> 00:29:53,653
than making sure she paid
full freight for the ride?

581
00:29:53,725 --> 00:29:56,250
And GHB was the ticket.
We traced the chemicals...

582
00:29:56,327 --> 00:29:57,658
we know where
you mixed them.

583
00:29:57,729 --> 00:29:59,959
All we have to do is execute
another search warrant...

584
00:30:00,031 --> 00:30:01,794
and we're gonna have more than
what we need...

585
00:30:01,866 --> 00:30:05,029
to put you and your accomplice
away for a very long time.

586
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:09,334
I better call a lawyer.
Be my guest.

587
00:30:23,188 --> 00:30:26,351
You think she'll take the
bait? We'll know soon enough.

588
00:30:28,193 --> 00:30:29,251
Okay.

589
00:31:00,558 --> 00:31:01,547
You bitch.

590
00:31:07,165 --> 00:31:08,996
Prison is no sorority, Jodie.

591
00:31:09,067 --> 00:31:12,093
On the bright side, you
still might be young enough...

592
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:14,934
to have kids when you get out.
You don't scare me.

593
00:31:15,006 --> 00:31:18,407
What if I told you we have enough
evidence to send you to prison?

594
00:31:18,476 --> 00:31:20,034
My father would
never let that happen.

595
00:31:20,111 --> 00:31:23,547
Your fingerprints on the eyedropper.
Daddy can't help you with that.

596
00:31:23,615 --> 00:31:26,311
Look, Jodie,
I was in a sorority, too.

597
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:29,512
I understand that the bonds
of sisterhood run very deep.

598
00:31:30,321 --> 00:31:32,448
But Tess sold you out.

599
00:31:32,523 --> 00:31:33,512
She would never do that.

600
00:31:33,591 --> 00:31:36,025
She made a phone call
that put you in the basement.

601
00:31:36,094 --> 00:31:38,528
We know she was the one
who had the beef with Kelly.

602
00:31:38,596 --> 00:31:41,360
You just did the dirty
work for her. Look...

603
00:31:41,766 --> 00:31:43,063
you tell us the truth...

604
00:31:43,134 --> 00:31:46,626
and we'll try to convince the DA to
take your cooperation into consideration.

605
00:31:46,704 --> 00:31:48,228
You don't know Tess.

606
00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:50,404
If she did that to Kelly...

607
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:54,101
I'm James Woodrow,
Miss Tomlinson's lawyer.

608
00:31:54,178 --> 00:31:57,204
Her father, Justice Tomlinson,
sends his regards.

609
00:31:57,282 --> 00:32:00,445
And meanwhile, my client is
invoking her constitutional right...

610
00:32:00,518 --> 00:32:02,645
to keep her mouth shut.

611
00:32:05,123 --> 00:32:06,818
Jodie's lawyer
has pulled the plug.

612
00:32:06,891 --> 00:32:09,883
I think he'll reconsider, once he
and her father see the evidence.

613
00:32:09,961 --> 00:32:14,022
At least we've got them on possession,
possibly rape three, acting in concert.

614
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:15,190
Now the bad news.

615
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:18,429
Joe's and Hank's DNA don't match
the semen from the rape kit.

616
00:32:18,503 --> 00:32:21,336
Are you sure?
Lab checked it twice.

617
00:32:21,673 --> 00:32:24,540
So we got a rape, but we
still don't have a rapist.

618
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:26,770
What about Joe? Doesn't
the clap implicate him?

619
00:32:26,844 --> 00:32:30,177
Gonorrhea cannot be genetically
traced. So without the DNA...

620
00:32:30,248 --> 00:32:31,579
This is interesting.

621
00:32:31,649 --> 00:32:34,277
Remember that ugly scarf with
all the little fish on it?

622
00:32:34,352 --> 00:32:35,819
The one they found
in the bushes?

623
00:32:35,887 --> 00:32:38,048
Lab lifted two distinct
hair fibers from it.

624
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:40,989
One belongs to Kelly,
the other matches the semen.

625
00:32:42,393 --> 00:32:43,860
Looks familiar.

626
00:32:44,228 --> 00:32:45,593
We found it where you fell.

627
00:32:45,663 --> 00:32:48,564
There were hairs on it belonging
to you and another person.

628
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:51,193
The guy who raped me?
That's what we believe.

629
00:32:51,269 --> 00:32:54,796
Think hard, Kelly.
This is a very unusual scarf.

630
00:33:00,578 --> 00:33:03,240
You frat boys
and your nicknames.

631
00:33:13,624 --> 00:33:16,991
Walleye. That's a kind
of fish, isn't it?

632
00:33:17,462 --> 00:33:20,329
That wasn't a very bright
move, giving Kelly your scarf.

633
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:22,559
I didn't.
You saying she stole it?

634
00:33:22,867 --> 00:33:24,767
She must have.

635
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:27,096
From where?
I don't know.

636
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:28,934
You don't know
where you keep your clothes?

637
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:30,235
I don't know how she got it.

638
00:33:30,308 --> 00:33:33,505
Why don't we try and figure that one
out? You said you were in Joe's room.

639
00:33:33,578 --> 00:33:36,411
I left to study.
I meant later...

640
00:33:36,981 --> 00:33:39,541
when you found Kelly alone.

641
00:33:39,617 --> 00:33:44,145
Like I said, I offered to walk
her home, but she left without me.

642
00:33:51,896 --> 00:33:56,128
The hair fibers on the scarf, match
the semen that you left on Kelly.

643
00:33:59,837 --> 00:34:01,634
Why'd you lie, Wally?

644
00:34:08,813 --> 00:34:11,179
When I saw her
sitting there...

645
00:34:11,983 --> 00:34:13,951
she looked so sad.

646
00:34:14,752 --> 00:34:16,879
I took her to my room...

647
00:34:17,255 --> 00:34:20,315
and I brushed the hair
back from her face.

648
00:34:21,826 --> 00:34:23,817
And for the first time...

649
00:34:24,695 --> 00:34:29,132
she looked at me
like she actually saw me.

650
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:33,704
And we sat on my bed...

651
00:34:34,539 --> 00:34:36,097
and talked...

652
00:34:37,208 --> 00:34:39,199
and then she kissed me.

653
00:34:41,312 --> 00:34:42,301
And...

654
00:34:42,947 --> 00:34:44,847
the rest just happened.

655
00:34:46,951 --> 00:34:49,920
I didn't know she was drugged.

656
00:34:50,655 --> 00:34:53,180
I thought she wanted
to be with me.

657
00:34:58,362 --> 00:35:01,092
It doesn't matter if Wally
knew, it's rape by statute.

658
00:35:01,165 --> 00:35:03,030
Could we offer him a deal?

659
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:07,197
His DNA is the only concrete evidence
we have linking rapist to victim.

660
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:10,763
I can't afford to compromise my case
against the others by dealing him out.

661
00:35:10,842 --> 00:35:12,742
Yet, somehow that
does not seem right.

662
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:15,142
The kid goes down
because he misread signals?

663
00:35:15,213 --> 00:35:18,114
If we offer him a deal, we send
mixed signals to the grand jury.

664
00:35:18,182 --> 00:35:20,707
I can't ask them to indict
the sorority sisters on rape...

665
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:22,150
without offering up a rapist.

666
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:25,155
The case against Joe that
shaky? It's circumstantial.

667
00:35:25,223 --> 00:35:28,090
By itself, it's probably not
enough to secure an indictment...

668
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:29,183
for acting in concert.

669
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:32,161
You mean, after all this,
there's a chance Joe could walk?

670
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:35,028
Which is why we can't afford
to lose Wally as a defendant.

671
00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:37,260
If we can secure indictments
across the board...

672
00:35:37,335 --> 00:35:39,701
I might be in a position to
offer him a lesser charge...

673
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:41,465
in exchange for his testimony.

674
00:35:48,379 --> 00:35:49,539
I'm nervous.

675
00:35:49,914 --> 00:35:52,075
You're gonna do fine.
Just listen to Alex.

676
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:55,142
She'll guide you through
the testimony, step by step.

677
00:35:55,419 --> 00:35:57,080
Will any of them
be in the room?

678
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:59,749
No. Just you, Alex,
and the grand jury.

679
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:04,026
I hope I'm doing the right
thing. Kelly, you are.

680
00:36:04,228 --> 00:36:06,958
I still can't remember anything.
What if they don't believe me?

681
00:36:07,031 --> 00:36:08,498
Just tell them what you know.

682
00:36:08,566 --> 00:36:11,467
The other witnesses
will tell them the rest.

683
00:36:11,802 --> 00:36:12,791
Ready?

684
00:36:15,806 --> 00:36:16,795
Kelly?

685
00:36:17,408 --> 00:36:19,842
I thought you said
they wouldn't be here.

686
00:36:19,911 --> 00:36:22,072
They won't be inside.
I promise.

687
00:36:23,614 --> 00:36:27,380
I was lying on my back
in the hospital, shaking.

688
00:36:28,286 --> 00:36:30,447
The doctor told me...

689
00:36:31,455 --> 00:36:33,082
I'd been raped.

690
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:36,182
I was scared.

691
00:36:37,495 --> 00:36:40,225
It's like someone stealing
a piece of your soul.

692
00:36:40,898 --> 00:36:44,356
And even when you find out
who, and how...

693
00:36:44,435 --> 00:36:46,630
you can never get it back.

694
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:49,104
I may not remember
that night...

695
00:36:50,074 --> 00:36:52,838
but I do remember
my life before it...

696
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,012
and I'll never be
that person again.

697
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:01,916
GHB acts as an intoxicant...

698
00:37:01,986 --> 00:37:05,979
depressing one's inhibitions
and making one extremely pliable.

699
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:07,957
Does the drug affect
one's memory?

700
00:37:08,025 --> 00:37:11,961
In nearly all cases, the victim
suffers permanent short-term amnesia.

701
00:37:12,029 --> 00:37:15,089
We found a notebook
belonging to Tess Michner.

702
00:37:15,266 --> 00:37:18,895
Underneath the heading "Love
potion," was a formula for GHB...

703
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:23,669
which exactly matched the GHB
found in Kelly D'leah's blood.

704
00:37:24,108 --> 00:37:25,769
Now, a few days later...

705
00:37:26,277 --> 00:37:28,939
base chemicals were discovered
in the sorority basement...

706
00:37:29,013 --> 00:37:31,846
and fingerprints
subsequently tied...

707
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:35,181
Tess Michner and Jodie
Tomlinson to the containers.

708
00:37:35,486 --> 00:37:38,114
I saw Tess and Jodie
mixing chemicals...

709
00:37:38,322 --> 00:37:41,553
in their bedroom the night
before they went out with Kelly.

710
00:37:41,626 --> 00:37:44,493
What were they mixing?
I don't know.

711
00:37:44,829 --> 00:37:46,854
But they called it
a love potion.

712
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:49,764
They kept laughing and filling
Kelly's glass.

713
00:37:49,834 --> 00:37:51,324
Did Joe say anything to you

714
00:37:51,402 --> 00:37:53,199
when he sent you
from the room?

715
00:37:54,505 --> 00:37:56,700
That he was going
to hit a home run.

716
00:37:56,874 --> 00:37:59,536
And who was in the room
when you left?

717
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:03,246
Just Joe and Kelly.

718
00:38:03,414 --> 00:38:07,510
The examination revealed a torn hymen,
semen, and the presence of gonorrhea.

719
00:38:07,885 --> 00:38:10,353
Can gonorrhea be transmitted
without leaving semen?

720
00:38:10,421 --> 00:38:13,083
Yes, if the individual
penetrates without ejaculating.

721
00:38:13,157 --> 00:38:16,558
DNA analysis matched
the semen to Wallace Parker.

722
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:21,257
However, that semen was free of gonorrhea.
What does that suggest to you, doctor?

723
00:38:21,332 --> 00:38:23,823
Someone else
infected Kelly D'leah.

724
00:38:23,901 --> 00:38:26,734
We discovered underwear stuffed
between Joe's bed and wall.

725
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:29,364
Blood spots on his sheets
also belonged to Kelly D'leah.

726
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:32,500
The crime lab analyzed a
sample of Joe Templeton's urine.

727
00:38:32,576 --> 00:38:36,068
What did they report? He
was infected with gonorrhea.

728
00:38:38,849 --> 00:38:40,077
How we doing?

729
00:38:40,618 --> 00:38:43,883
About as well as could be
expected. How are you holding up?

730
00:38:43,954 --> 00:38:45,979
All right, I guess.

731
00:38:46,057 --> 00:38:47,718
You wanted to see us?

732
00:38:47,958 --> 00:38:50,552
Wally's lawyer served us
with a cross 190.50.

733
00:38:51,028 --> 00:38:52,052
What's that?

734
00:38:52,129 --> 00:38:53,892
It means that Wally is
exercising his right

735
00:38:53,964 --> 00:38:56,159
to testify in front
of a grand jury.

736
00:38:56,233 --> 00:38:58,360
What's he have to say?
I don't know.

737
00:38:58,436 --> 00:39:00,427
I was hoping
you could tell me.

738
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:03,030
I told you,
I don't remember anything.

739
00:39:03,107 --> 00:39:05,837
I don't think Wally's lawyer would
risk a grand jury appearance...

740
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:08,504
if he didn't think his client
could be persuasive in an argument.

741
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:10,706
A DNA match
will make anyone desperate.

742
00:39:10,815 --> 00:39:13,215
Unless there's
a mitigating explanation.

743
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:16,411
Can you think of anything that
might have happened that night...

744
00:39:16,487 --> 00:39:18,352
to lead Wally to believe
his advances were welcomed?

745
00:39:18,422 --> 00:39:20,151
Anything that might be
construed as consent?

746
00:39:20,224 --> 00:39:23,284
I can't remember. Okay,
what about before that night?

747
00:39:24,595 --> 00:39:25,994
Think hard, Kelly.

748
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:29,361
Did you ever flirt with
him even just a little? No.

749
00:39:31,836 --> 00:39:34,304
Well, maybe.

750
00:39:35,072 --> 00:39:36,061
Tell me.

751
00:39:37,475 --> 00:39:39,705
We had a couple classes
together.

752
00:39:39,777 --> 00:39:41,301
He was a whiz
at the classics...

753
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:45,110
so I invited him for coffee a few
times afterward just to pick his brain.

754
00:39:45,182 --> 00:39:47,650
You know... And yes, I
knew he had a crush on me...

755
00:39:47,718 --> 00:39:51,313
but I never... What? That
doesn't mean I'm a slut.

756
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:53,118
Kelly, we know.

757
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:56,250
It's just, it might give them the
ammunition they need to plead innocent.

758
00:39:56,327 --> 00:39:59,057
I knew I shouldn't have
gone through with this.

759
00:39:59,463 --> 00:40:02,489
Okay. So what can you do?
Well...

760
00:40:02,933 --> 00:40:05,993
after he makes his statement,
I get to cross examine him.

761
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:08,402
Don't worry,
I'll go after him.

762
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:13,437
It began as a friendship...

763
00:40:13,511 --> 00:40:15,979
and became something more,
that night.

764
00:40:16,614 --> 00:40:18,343
We had sex.

765
00:40:18,783 --> 00:40:23,083
But I didn't know she was
drugged. I swear, I didn't know.

766
00:40:25,055 --> 00:40:28,855
Mr. Parker, just a couple of
questions for clarification.

767
00:40:30,027 --> 00:40:33,428
You saw the vomit on the floor. Yes.

768
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:37,265
You saw her disheveled appearance. Yes.

769
00:40:37,334 --> 00:40:39,962
Her matted hair, the watering eyes. Yes.

770
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:43,095
And you still didn't know
she was under the influence...

771
00:40:43,174 --> 00:40:46,541
when you asked her into your
room? I thought she was tired.

772
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:49,443
Tired?
Upset, maybe.

773
00:40:50,181 --> 00:40:51,910
She looked sad.

774
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:54,812
And you took that as
an invitation to have sex?

775
00:40:55,252 --> 00:40:57,049
No, I mean...

776
00:40:57,121 --> 00:40:59,646
Did she say she wanted
to have sex with you?

777
00:41:00,991 --> 00:41:03,551
She flirted with me.
When?

778
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:06,221
In class, at the coffee shop.

779
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:09,095
Did she say she wanted to
have sex with you then?

780
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:10,989
No.

781
00:41:11,068 --> 00:41:12,660
Did she say she
wanted to have sex with you...

782
00:41:12,736 --> 00:41:16,365
the night that you took her into
your room? She didn't have to.

783
00:41:17,274 --> 00:41:19,037
I'll take that as a no.

784
00:41:21,212 --> 00:41:22,338
She kissed me.

785
00:41:22,413 --> 00:41:25,314
And you took that kiss as
the green light to go ahead?

786
00:41:25,382 --> 00:41:27,009
She never said no.

787
00:41:27,084 --> 00:41:29,314
Her shirt was stained
with vomit...

788
00:41:29,386 --> 00:41:32,253
her hair was matted,
her eyes were blurry...

789
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:35,258
and you still thought
she wanted to have sex?

790
00:41:35,893 --> 00:41:36,985
Yes.

791
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:40,858
I guess it was just
your lucky night.

792
00:41:46,737 --> 00:41:48,705
What is taking so long?

793
00:41:48,772 --> 00:41:50,364
Don't read too much into it.

794
00:41:50,441 --> 00:41:52,432
They have a lot of evidence
to sift through...

795
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:55,035
a lot of testimony
to consider.

796
00:42:11,328 --> 00:42:12,317
Hey.

797
00:42:13,564 --> 00:42:14,553
So?

798
00:42:15,132 --> 00:42:18,329
The grand jury indicted Tess
and Jodie on possession...

799
00:42:19,737 --> 00:42:22,831
but they didn't return charges
against Wally or Joe.

800
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:25,402
They're saying I wasn't raped?

801
00:42:25,476 --> 00:42:28,536
But what about the semen,
the gonorrhea, the hickeys?

802
00:42:28,612 --> 00:42:32,173
Apparently, the grand jury
split on the issue of consent...

803
00:42:32,249 --> 00:42:37,084
they believed that you were drugged, but
they didn't believe that the guys knew.

804
00:42:37,187 --> 00:42:40,156
On the other hand,
the dean expelled them all.

805
00:42:42,526 --> 00:42:44,517
Hardly seems worth it.

806
00:42:45,529 --> 00:42:48,692
Kelly, you did
the right thing.

807
00:42:52,069 --> 00:42:54,629
I never took those pills
the doctor gave me.

808
00:42:54,705 --> 00:42:57,196
I don't know why,
but I just... I couldn't.

809
00:42:57,575 --> 00:42:59,509
What if I'm pregnant?

810
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:04,437
I'm probably not
the best person to ask.

811
00:43:04,782 --> 00:43:07,080
What about my parents?

812
00:43:09,053 --> 00:43:11,112
I haven't told them yet.

813
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:15,983
Might be a good time, huh?
