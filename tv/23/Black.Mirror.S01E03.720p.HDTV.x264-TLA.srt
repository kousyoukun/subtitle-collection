1
00:00:18,943 --> 00:00:21,069
Liam Foxwell, welcome.

2
00:00:21,081 --> 00:00:22,387
Thank you.

3
00:00:22,401 --> 00:00:23,906
OK, little speech time.

4
00:00:23,963 --> 00:00:26,637
I've mentioned this to
everyone about their appraisals,

5
00:00:26,762 --> 00:00:30,383
and I just want you to know that this
isn't a witch-hunt for the deadwood.

6
00:00:30,443 --> 00:00:32,023
It is much more of a...

7
00:00:33,483 --> 00:00:35,477
treasure hunt for the gold?

8
00:00:36,337 --> 00:00:37,655
Shit sinks.

9
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,437
But also, cream floats.

10
00:00:39,562 --> 00:00:41,199
Yes, yes, I see that.

11
00:00:41,243 --> 00:00:44,014
A new the area we're
getting lots of play in ...

12
00:00:44,027 --> 00:00:46,438
and your office could
be at the centre for ...

13
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:49,877
is litigation in
retrospective parenting cases.

14
00:00:50,002 --> 00:00:51,164
Retrospective...

15
00:00:51,189 --> 00:00:53,990
Bobby sues Mum and Dad
for insufficient attention

16
00:00:54,002 --> 00:00:57,803
leading to lack of confidence,
leading to damages against earnings.

17
00:00:57,828 --> 00:01:01,716
Right, and we're OK,
the firm's OK with that, ethically?

18
00:01:01,841 --> 00:01:03,237
And morally?

19
00:01:06,763 --> 00:01:07,971
Yep.

20
00:01:07,983 --> 00:01:09,018
Mm-hmm.

21
00:01:09,031 --> 00:01:10,077
Sure.

22
00:01:10,483 --> 00:01:11,889
Yeah, yeah, right.

23
00:01:12,483 --> 00:01:13,550
Are you?

24
00:01:14,259 --> 00:01:15,590
Totally, yeah.

25
00:01:17,281 --> 00:01:18,637
Yes.

26
00:01:19,851 --> 00:01:21,454
OK, Liam, look,

27
00:01:21,455 --> 00:01:25,091
so if we invite you to stay with
the firm in the new environment,

28
00:01:25,862 --> 00:01:28,274
what we'd have you do is
pull an exhaustive redo

29
00:01:28,275 --> 00:01:30,346
with personnel, maybe... next week.

30
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:33,797
Oh, well, I was ready to do
a big redo right now, but...

31
00:01:33,922 --> 00:01:35,977
No, it's fine, next week's fine.

32
00:01:36,102 --> 00:01:39,822
But I have to ask you this ...
they're not going to hit anything

33
00:01:39,847 --> 00:01:41,787
to freak us out, are they?

34
00:01:42,412 --> 00:01:44,663
There's no major
deletions this quarter?

35
00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:47,647
No, no, everything's
well within... parameters.

36
00:01:48,523 --> 00:01:51,419
Great, OK, Liam,
this has been really great.

37
00:01:51,544 --> 00:01:52,588
Um...

38
00:01:53,123 --> 00:01:58,247
Look, really hope to... look
forward to seeing you again.

39
00:02:02,883 --> 00:02:04,194
OK, thank you.

40
00:02:18,003 --> 00:02:19,476
Airport, please.

this has been really great, Liam,

Sorry!

BLEEP

57
00:03:47,184 --> 00:03:48,564
Mr Foxwell.

58
00:03:48,689 --> 00:03:52,353
Could you just rewind me
your last 24 hours for me, please?

59
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,509
Great, and back that up for me
times 64 for the week.

60
00:04:10,827 --> 00:04:12,159
That's great.

61
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,886
Enjoy your flight, Mr Foxwell.

62
00:04:17,723 --> 00:04:20,027
I'm not being funny,
right, but look at that.

63
00:04:21,183 --> 00:04:22,589
Look at what?

64
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,899
That!

65
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:26,436
Frayed carpet, there, you see?

66
00:04:26,437 --> 00:04:27,743
Seriously?

67
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:29,357
Yes, seriously!

68
00:04:29,807 --> 00:04:31,519
This is a five-star suite.

69
00:04:32,211 --> 00:04:34,375
I pay good money
to have perfect details.

70
00:04:34,803 --> 00:04:38,479
Now I've got that shitty
carpet for the rest of my life.

71
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,559
Only if you keep looking at it,
mate.

72
00:04:40,956 --> 00:04:42,460
Oh, thanks, Jonas!

73
00:04:42,871 --> 00:04:43,928
Fuck off.

74
00:04:45,084 --> 00:04:49,534
All right, now, you thought the
carpet was bad, have a look at this.

75
00:04:54,014 --> 00:04:57,557
You've met Lucy, my wife,
at the Dublin wedding?

76
00:04:57,682 --> 00:04:59,573
Oh, that's right, yes, hi, Liam.

77
00:04:59,958 --> 00:05:01,525
Hi... Hi again.

78
00:05:02,761 --> 00:05:05,434
(Lucy, Dublin.)

79
00:05:06,174 --> 00:05:07,492
Hello.

80
00:05:07,617 --> 00:05:10,029
Lucy ... Liam,
we met at the Dublin wedding.

81
00:05:10,303 --> 00:05:11,599
Liam!

82
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,905
Oh, great.

83
00:05:13,204 --> 00:05:14,479
Liam, yes.

84
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:16,239
Come in.
Thank you.

85
00:05:18,228 --> 00:05:20,693
- Great to see you again.
- Yeah, you too.

86
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,119
Where's Fi been hiding you?

87
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,037
Oh, you know, in our house.

88
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:27,065
(LAUGHS)

89
00:05:27,078 --> 00:05:30,262
We didn't know ... well, she didn't
know if you would make it.

90
00:05:30,275 --> 00:05:32,115
It was over quicker than I thought.

91
00:05:33,032 --> 00:05:34,860
Oh, sorry, hello.

92
00:05:34,885 --> 00:05:37,829
Let's get you a drink.
Um, beer OK?

93
00:05:37,954 --> 00:05:39,533
Lovely, thank you.

94
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,694
Everyone's through there,
so I'll be in in a minute, OK?

95
00:05:45,719 --> 00:05:46,814
OK, thank you.

96
00:05:58,110 --> 00:05:59,119
Hi.

97
00:06:00,763 --> 00:06:03,743
You're back early, then,
I didn't think you'd make it.

98
00:06:03,868 --> 00:06:07,424
Yeah, I didn't stay over and I
caught an early flight back, so...

99
00:06:07,549 --> 00:06:08,833
- Hi.
- Hello.

100
00:06:10,195 --> 00:06:11,755
So, how was the appraisal?

101
00:06:11,777 --> 00:06:15,319
Well, they said they'd let me do
a redo sometime next week, so...

102
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:17,047
Oh.
But good?

103
00:06:17,508 --> 00:06:18,521
Well...

104
00:06:19,278 --> 00:06:20,585
- Later?
- Later.

105
00:06:20,598 --> 00:06:21,606
OK.

106
00:06:21,874 --> 00:06:24,734
- How's Jody?
- At home, Gina's babysitting.

107
00:06:24,859 --> 00:06:26,166
Hey.

108
00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:27,434
Jonas, this is...

109
00:06:27,459 --> 00:06:29,457
- Liam ...
- Jonas.

110
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:31,479
Dude, it's really nice to meet you.

111
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,679
- You all right?
- Good, thank you.

112
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,351
- And you know Jeff?
- Yes.

113
00:06:35,376 --> 00:06:38,484
Yeah, you remember meeting Jeff,
because he'd have shown you,

114
00:06:38,497 --> 00:06:41,478
I don't know, a redo
of the side of his fridge.

115
00:06:41,603 --> 00:06:43,494
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
piss off, Jonas.

116
00:06:43,518 --> 00:06:44,824
- Hello.
- Hello.

117
00:06:44,825 --> 00:06:46,976
Your wife's being
very mean to me tonight.

118
00:06:47,001 --> 00:06:48,199
Oh, well she's like that.

119
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,606
Yeah, tell me about it.

120
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:53,113
- You all right for a drink?
- I'm fine, thank you, Jonas.

121
00:06:54,021 --> 00:06:57,325
Lynn, come and meet Liam, he's, um...

122
00:06:58,842 --> 00:07:01,639
A soon-to-be
unemployed/unemployable lawyer.

123
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,683
(LAUGHS)

124
00:07:04,284 --> 00:07:05,625
And Jeff.

125
00:07:06,328 --> 00:07:07,963
Jeff and Fi...

126
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:11,439
used to run the parties down
the Fraser Road with Paul and me.

127
00:07:11,907 --> 00:07:13,225
Mad old days.

128
00:07:14,262 --> 00:07:15,917
Before we started up the Kings.

129
00:07:17,321 --> 00:07:18,837
So, yeah...

130
00:07:20,722 --> 00:07:24,635
So, Liam, what was it you had,
an assessment?

131
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:25,962
Appraisal.

132
00:07:25,963 --> 00:07:27,239
How'd it go?

133
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,637
Good.

134
00:07:28,762 --> 00:07:32,873
Well, it was a disaster,
but you know, I don't know.

135
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:34,232
- Hard to gauge?
- Yeah

136
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,525
Let's have a look.

137
00:07:35,604 --> 00:07:37,740
Redo, we can
appraise the appraisal.

138
00:07:38,963 --> 00:07:40,277
Yeah, great.

139
00:07:40,402 --> 00:07:42,411
Throw it up there
and we can grade you.

140
00:07:42,747 --> 00:07:44,550
- Come on.
- Um...

141
00:07:44,575 --> 00:07:46,677
It could be fun, we could, um...

142
00:07:46,695 --> 00:07:47,727
vote!

143
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,885
- Paul?
- Yeah?

144
00:07:49,963 --> 00:07:52,995
I work in recruitment,
so it might be quite useful for you.

145
00:07:52,998 --> 00:07:53,601
Right, OK.

146
00:07:53,602 --> 00:07:56,275
Liam's redoing his
appraisal so we can give him marks.

147
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,397
- Notes.
- Pointers, you know.

148
00:07:58,415 --> 00:08:00,679
- I think Liam would probably...
- Yes, do you know what...

149
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,843
Guys, no, come on,
seriously, that's not cool,

150
00:08:03,855 --> 00:08:06,319
I mean Liam's
obviously uncomfortable,

151
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,599
so let's just drop it, yeah?

152
00:08:09,609 --> 00:08:10,940
Have a cool time.

153
00:08:12,805 --> 00:08:14,119
Time to eat!

154
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,566
Oh, it's ready.

155
00:08:19,387 --> 00:08:21,824
Thank you so much
for inviting us this evening.

156
00:08:21,849 --> 00:08:24,672
It's been too long, too long.

157
00:08:25,175 --> 00:08:26,518
Fi.

158
00:08:28,643 --> 00:08:31,309
I haven't met him before, have I?
Jonas, is it?

159
00:08:31,434 --> 00:08:33,040
He's one of the old crowd.

160
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,631
I think I said.

161
00:08:36,071 --> 00:08:37,578
- You OK?
- Yeah, yeah.

162
00:08:37,584 --> 00:08:40,880
- You know, if you're not in the mood,
we can go. - No, no, I'm fine.

163
00:08:40,905 --> 00:08:41,913
Sure?

164
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,799
QUIETLY TALKING AND LAUGHING

165
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,618
Hey!

166
00:09:02,643 --> 00:09:03,643
Sync and corrected by APOLLO
www.addic7ed.com

167
00:09:03,649 --> 00:09:06,488
Yeah! I brought enough
for others to share.

168
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:07,649
Thank you.

169
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:10,809
I've, er, been cooking a lot
since the break-up.

170
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:12,729
Jonas has had a tough one.

171
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:13,969
DOORBELL RINGS

172
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,209
Was it bad?

173
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:17,450
Er, yeah.

174
00:09:17,483 --> 00:09:20,285
Yeah, erm, we were in the middle
of planning is all

175
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:24,463
and I suddenly realised that
the less the relationship means

176
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:26,483
the more you spend
on the wedding, you know!

177
00:09:26,508 --> 00:09:27,529
(LAUGHS)

178
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:30,049
You actually start obsessing over
the tiniest little details,

179
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:33,089
like the thickness
of the wedding invitation paper

180
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:37,350
because, I mean, God knows you need
something to fucking talk about!

181
00:09:37,403 --> 00:09:40,227
So, everybody, this is Helen.

182
00:09:40,874 --> 00:09:42,602
Helen, Jonas.

183
00:09:42,727 --> 00:09:44,125
- Hi.
- Hi.

184
00:09:44,433 --> 00:09:46,211
And everyone!

185
00:09:46,949 --> 00:09:48,885
(ALL) - Hi!
- Help yourself.

186
00:09:48,911 --> 00:09:51,809
Jonas was just explaining why
relationships are a sham.

187
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:53,409
Are they? Shit!

188
00:09:54,161 --> 00:09:56,512
They're like going
to the theatre, OK?

189
00:09:56,637 --> 00:10:00,769
You pay loads to go and ultimately
you are wasting your entire night,

190
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:03,889
so, when someone asks you,
"Did you have a good time?",

191
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:07,889
you both say,
"Yeah! Yeah, it was great."

192
00:10:07,907 --> 00:10:10,037
The problem is the
more that you pay

193
00:10:10,045 --> 00:10:14,249
and the longer it goes on, the more
you're, "Oh, yeah, we loved it!",

194
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:18,049
you know, "We love being together
and never fucking anyone else"

195
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:20,127
"and only just having
one other person"

196
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:25,445
"to share our real thoughts with for
our entire lives, yeah, it's great!"

197
00:10:25,468 --> 00:10:27,562
Would you say you loved her, though?

198
00:10:30,748 --> 00:10:35,435
I just think we just really fancied
each other and that was what it was.

199
00:10:35,447 --> 00:10:36,873
You know what it's like early on.

200
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:39,009
You know, we were just,
I don't know,

201
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:41,169
we were just two tools
in the tool shed

202
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:42,889
that just fit together
really fucking well.

203
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:47,525
I mean, still, by the end, I'd
be like, "Go on, honey, you go up,"

204
00:10:47,526 --> 00:10:49,729
"I'm just going to watch
a little bit more of the news"

205
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:52,328
and I'd find myself, you know,
watching redos of, like,

206
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:54,449
hot times in earlier relationships!

207
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:55,762
Easy!

208
00:10:56,483 --> 00:10:59,178
I'm just saying, there's
a beautiful woman upstairs,

209
00:10:59,203 --> 00:11:00,574
you know, waiting
to have sex with me.

210
00:11:00,549 --> 00:11:01,836
What, right now?

211
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:05,325
(THEY LAUGH)

212
00:11:05,346 --> 00:11:08,489
She's upstairs, you know,
waiting to have sex with me

213
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:12,489
and I'm sat downstairs watching
redos of, like, some hot times

214
00:11:12,769 --> 00:11:16,362
with some hot girl that I just
picked up in some place

215
00:11:16,363 --> 00:11:20,280
and I'm fucking pulling
myself off. I mean, seriously?

216
00:11:23,003 --> 00:11:24,341
Oh, come on...

217
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:27,009
Come on, guys.

218
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:28,769
I mean, we all scroll
through the Grain

219
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:30,369
rifling through our greatest hits

220
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:33,445
for a little bit of filth
now and then, surely?

221
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:34,871
Not me.

222
00:11:36,947 --> 00:11:38,912
Helen doesn't have a Grain!

223
00:11:40,003 --> 00:11:41,805
- Oh, wow!
- Wow!

224
00:11:42,077 --> 00:11:43,469
No shit!

225
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:45,769
Was that a political thing?

226
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:48,289
No, no, I was gouged
about 12 months ago.

227
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:50,769
Jesus, was that painful?

228
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:53,009
Total agony.

229
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:55,809
But on the plus of that, I don't
remember it that clearly.

230
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:57,329
There's a scar on here.

231
00:11:57,985 --> 00:11:59,764
Yeah, can I, er...?

232
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:13,169
Yeah, that feels quite nice.

233
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:14,729
Yeah, that feels quite nice.
(THEY CHUCKLE)

234
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:17,529
Yeah, no brain damage, clearly!

235
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:20,787
Well, my sight held on fine, so...

236
00:12:20,912 --> 00:12:22,609
So, who took it then?

237
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:24,929
Stolen to order,
as far as they could tell,

238
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:28,289
probably to some millionaire
Chinese perve.

239
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:29,889
Really?! Yeah.

240
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:31,569
Is that for real?

241
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:33,649
Yeah, and none of
it was encrypted, so...

242
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:35,649
So, they saw the lot!

243
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:38,918
The thing is, after I was gouged
I didn't have one for a few days

244
00:12:39,043 --> 00:12:40,900
and then just kind of, liked it.

245
00:12:44,893 --> 00:12:46,129
It's cool.

246
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:47,209
That's cool.

247
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:49,369
I mean, because more people are...

248
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:52,049
I mean, now, right?
Like, going Grainless?

249
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:53,489
I believe it's huge with hookers.

250
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:55,169
I mean, no offence!

251
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:56,289
(THEY LAUGH)

252
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:59,009
No, no, it's OK. Sure, I...

253
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:01,227
Well, I'm pretty boring.
One man is a time.

254
00:13:01,352 --> 00:13:02,383
Boo!

255
00:13:03,726 --> 00:13:06,169
Serial monogamist.

256
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:07,987
I'm a serial monogamist.

257
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:10,729
I'm staying faithful
to my cornflakes right now!

258
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:12,837
(LAUGHS)

259
00:13:14,861 --> 00:13:17,849
Well, I think it's an interesting
choice, going Grainless.

260
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:19,009
It's a brave choice.

261
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:20,767
I'm sorry, but I...

262
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:24,769
I couldn't do it.

263
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:26,253
Uh-huh.

264
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:32,809
OK, I was going to play some redos
from the Fraser O days.

265
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:34,249
(ALL) Yay!

266
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:36,649
Stuff from last night,
depressing and fun.

267
00:13:37,385 --> 00:13:40,544
You know half the organic
memories you have a junk,

268
00:13:40,843 --> 00:13:42,165
just not trustworthy.

269
00:13:42,183 --> 00:13:43,929
Colleen works in Grain development.

270
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:47,006
With half the population you can
implant false memories,

271
00:13:47,018 --> 00:13:49,356
just by asking leading
questions in therapy.

272
00:13:49,481 --> 00:13:51,880
You can make people
remember getting lost

273
00:13:51,893 --> 00:13:53,769
in shopping malls they
never visited,

274
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:56,782
getting bothered by paedophile
babysitters they never had.

275
00:13:58,697 --> 00:14:00,775
I'm just happier now.

276
00:14:02,545 --> 00:14:03,704
TAPE REWINDING

277
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:07,849
'OK, great, Liam, this has been,
this has been really great, erm...

278
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:10,568
'we really hope to look
forward to seeing you again.'

279
00:14:10,576 --> 00:14:12,537
He looks forward to seeing
you again, that's good.

280
00:14:12,541 --> 00:14:13,969
"Hopes" to look forward.

281
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:15,449
TAPE REWINDING

282
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:18,609
'We really hope to look
forward to seeing you again.'

283
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:19,914
It's phoney.

284
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:22,574
Hang on.

285
00:14:22,575 --> 00:14:23,837
Pause it.

286
00:14:23,962 --> 00:14:25,372
Now backup.

287
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:27,599
Zoom in there.

288
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:29,889
Come on, that's a tick.

289
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:31,449
That could be a V or an L.

290
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:33,845
- It's a tick!
- Or the start of the swastika.

291
00:14:33,855 --> 00:14:37,261
It's probably the start of the
swastika, they were such pricks!

292
00:14:42,132 --> 00:14:44,805
- Did you have fun with the old gang?
- Yeah.

293
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:48,689
D'you speak to that Jonas much?

294
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:50,546
No, no, not really.

295
00:14:54,764 --> 00:14:56,480
He's a bit of a knob, ain't he?

296
00:14:56,493 --> 00:14:58,169
Bit of a dick?

297
00:14:58,170 --> 00:14:59,209
Jonas.

298
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:02,769
Pulling himself off to his own
relationship theories.

299
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:06,089
Oh, it must be such a drag,
Jonas, putting it about!

300
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:08,809
And when he protected me
from those arseholes,

301
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:10,649
"Hey, come on, guys,"

302
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:13,329
"it's really not cool to redo
another man's appraisals, dudes."

303
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:15,169
Then why invite him over?

304
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:16,476
I like him.

305
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:24,849
You wanted me to invite him.

306
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:26,529
I didn't say anything.

307
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:29,089
You were laughing
at everything he said.

308
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:31,609
You invited him!

309
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:33,948
It was obvious
I didn't want him to come.

310
00:15:36,169 --> 00:15:39,369
'Wow, it's only, it's early
to call it a night.'

311
00:15:39,371 --> 00:15:41,085
'Do fancy a quick one down the pub?'

312
00:15:41,096 --> 00:15:42,409
'Oh, we've got to get back,

313
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:44,969
'rescue Jodie from
the paedophile babysitter!

314
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:46,529
'(LAUGHS)'

315
00:15:46,542 --> 00:15:47,848
'Yeah.'

316
00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:53,609
'But why don't you come back to
ours, for a nightcap if you want?'

317
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:54,649
See?

318
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:58,906
It was obvious I didn't want him to
come, I was being polite to a moron.

319
00:15:59,031 --> 00:16:01,877
If you really don't want to come,
you can get rid of him.

320
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:14,959
Hey, hey!

321
00:16:14,968 --> 00:16:16,032
Hey.

322
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:19,862
Well, actually, what time is it?

323
00:16:19,901 --> 00:16:21,380
It's midnight.

324
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:23,476
Shit, it's quite late,
time's gone on.

325
00:16:23,494 --> 00:16:25,493
(LAUGHS) Yeah, time does that.

326
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:26,729
15 minutes.

327
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:27,889
Yeah.

328
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:30,917
But we've got the babysitter
inside, so...

329
00:16:31,042 --> 00:16:32,889
So, is that new info?

330
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:36,889
No, it's just that we, I mean,
we thought, right, Fi?

331
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:38,969
Yeah. Yeah.

332
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:40,329
OK, no, I get it.

333
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:42,449
No, it's just that, actually,
it turns out we're tired

334
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:45,489
and I guess we forgot,
but now we've remembered, so...

335
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:46,529
Sorry.

336
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:47,369
No, it's fine, really.

337
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:48,409
I'm sorry.

338
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:50,969
Oh, it's cool, no worries.

339
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:52,849
I've got a back-up plan, so...

340
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:54,609
Oh, cool, well, we vote the back-up.

341
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:56,049
Yeah, I will do.

342
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:57,809
Er, see you later, Fi.

343
00:16:57,810 --> 00:16:58,969
It was good to meet you, man.

344
00:16:58,970 --> 00:16:59,981
Yeah.

345
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:01,449
Nice one.

346
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:02,870
Brilliant. Brilliant.

347
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:06,359
OK, cool.

348
00:17:10,204 --> 00:17:11,522
Good to meet you, man.

349
00:17:11,647 --> 00:17:12,659
Yeah.

350
00:17:14,997 --> 00:17:18,729
Listen, Gina, it's a 40-minute
wait for a cab, but if you want,

351
00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:21,023
I have the bed made up in my office.

352
00:17:21,148 --> 00:17:22,465
Er... OK, thanks, Fi.

353
00:17:24,132 --> 00:17:28,129
Hey, there's just, you know, use
anything. There's T-shirts and...

354
00:17:28,254 --> 00:17:30,137
Yeah, thanks, I'll show myself out.

355
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:31,169
All right, night.

356
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:32,209
Night, guys.

357
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:33,523
Night, Gina.

358
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:42,144
Thank you.

359
00:17:43,629 --> 00:17:44,735
'Bye-bye.

360
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,649
'OK.

361
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:48,917
'Love you, love you.'

362
00:18:08,121 --> 00:18:10,089
Was he a big part of the gang?

363
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:11,478
Who? Jonas?

364
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:15,374
I don't know, yeah?

365
00:18:16,592 --> 00:18:19,489
Let me guess, he'd spent his time
oozing round the girls,

366
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:20,569
offering backrubs.

367
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:21,849
Not really.

368
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:23,597
Circling for an orifice.

369
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:27,289
Was he always that oily or...

370
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:28,596
OK, look.

371
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:31,969
What?

372
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:33,279
It's nothing, but...

373
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:40,049
You may have noticed a bit
of an atmosphere because...

374
00:18:41,761 --> 00:18:45,289
me and Jonas, years ago,
had a bit of a thing.

375
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,449
You had a thing with oily dude man?

376
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:48,529
It was just a little thing

377
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:50,049
and I didn't even know
you back then, so...

378
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:51,706
You slept with oily dude man?

379
00:18:52,577 --> 00:18:53,849
That's hilarious!

380
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:56,529
We've all got our skeletons,
how about you and Gemma?

381
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:58,129
What, I told you about Gemma.

382
00:18:58,130 --> 00:18:59,473
Gemma was a nutcase...

383
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,511
But you never mentioned Jonas.

384
00:19:02,536 --> 00:19:05,405
I did, I told you I hooked up
with someone in Marrakech.

385
00:19:05,414 --> 00:19:06,602
Jonas is Mr Marrakesh?!

386
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:07,849
It was a stupid thing...

387
00:19:07,858 --> 00:19:11,889
I thought Mr Marrakech was some
sort of super cool...

388
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:12,929
Not him.

389
00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:15,089
It was years ago and...

390
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:17,489
Are you embarrassed by that?

391
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,466
Cos it's embarrassing.

392
00:19:20,115 --> 00:19:23,259
I'm sorry, but, Christ,
are you not embarrassed?

393
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:24,739
It was years ago.

394
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:26,499
But you dated him for a month?

395
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,699
That's what I said.

396
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:31,699
Cos when you told me about
Mr Marrakech, it was a week.

397
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,557
No, I didn't.

398
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:35,692
Pah!

399
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:39,020
TAPE WINDING

400
00:19:39,331 --> 00:19:40,539
'What about you?'

401
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:42,819
I don't want to see our
first time right now.

402
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:43,899
Shh, you're about to talk.

403
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:47,059
'I went away and had a little thing
that did my head in for a while

404
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:50,179
'with this, sort of...

405
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:53,739
'..this, sort of, headfuck
that I met in Marrakech.'

406
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:55,059
'Mr Marrakech?'

407
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:56,379
'(LAUGHS) Yeah.'

408
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:59,779
'I'm imagining a chillum
and a big knob.'

409
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:03,779
'(LAUGHS) No, it was like dormouse.'

410
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:06,699
'Big deal, big heart-breaker?'

411
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:09,139
'No, it was just a week.

412
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:11,459
'It was a weird week.'

413
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:12,779
So, a weird week or a month?

414
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:14,619
The point is, it wasn't a big deal.

415
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:16,379
Well, it was big enough
to do your head in.

416
00:20:17,218 --> 00:20:20,613
Jonas, King Dormouse-Dick
of Marrakech did your head in!

417
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:25,859
That was a nice night, used to be.

418
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:27,356
You're getting obsessed.

419
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:29,299
I'm not.

420
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:31,779
We had all this with Dan, I don't
want you going like that again.

421
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:34,579
He had little creepy beady eyes
and he was always...

422
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:36,579
What? Acting like
he was interested?

423
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:38,739
And you know what, I think
he probably did fancy me

424
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:40,819
and actually he wasn't
completely hideous,

425
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:44,757
so in another life I don't know,
but nothing happened!

426
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:48,459
And Jonas...

427
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:52,459
he's an old fling.
So what? Don't go all fucked up!

428
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:54,099
What, I'm fucked up, am I?

429
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,339
No, I mean, just...

430
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:59,339
No, no, no, that's brilliant,
sometimes you're a bitch.

431
00:21:02,709 --> 00:21:04,425
I didn't mean that.

432
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:07,179
'You're a bitch!'

433
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:09,339
I'd like you to erase that.

434
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:10,419
'You're a bitch!'

435
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:12,299
Also, "sometimes".

436
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:15,474
You can't just edit off
the word, "sometimes"!

437
00:21:56,740 --> 00:22:01,083
I'm sorry, Fi, I know I go a bit
weird and wonky sometimes.

438
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:12,899
- I love you, you know?
- I know.

Come here a second.
I just want your opinion.

455

It's just a silly game.

456
00:24:27,813 --> 00:24:29,119
Sit down.

457
00:24:29,456 --> 00:24:30,849
Answer this.

458
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:34,319
I'm a serial monogamist.

459

I'm staying faithful
to my corn flakes right now.

Now, is that funny?

462
00:24:44,573 --> 00:24:47,930
There's no need to be nice,
the man's a prick.

463
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:52,599
Is that funny, in your opinion?

464
00:24:53,018 --> 00:24:54,395
Well...

465
00:24:54,398 --> 00:24:56,127
I'm a serial monogamist.

- No?
- No

- I don't know.
- You do.

470
00:25:05,243 --> 00:25:06,631
Morning.

471
00:25:06,756 --> 00:25:08,043
What's this?

472
00:25:08,044 --> 00:25:10,449
I'm just getting Gina's
opinion on something.

473

I'm a serial monogamist.

I was just wondering because you
found it funny, but it isn't,

477
00:25:20,363 --> 00:25:21,680
and Gina agrees.

478
00:25:21,805 --> 00:25:23,260
I don't really want to get involved.

479
00:25:23,273 --> 00:25:25,399
Let me get you a cab.
My dad's on his way.

480
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,879
Just one other thing.

481
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:32,727
We both want him to come back,
but who wants him to come back more?

482
00:25:32,852 --> 00:25:35,997
Off the top of your head,
who wants him to come back more?

483
00:25:36,122 --> 00:25:37,678
OK, well, bye.

484
00:25:37,803 --> 00:25:38,849
Yeah, bye.

485
00:25:39,421 --> 00:25:42,206
Wow, it's early. It's early
to call it a night.

486
00:25:42,231 --> 00:25:44,286
Fancy a quick one down the pub?

487
00:25:44,411 --> 00:25:47,402
Got to get back, rescue Jodie
from the paedophile baby-sitter.

488
00:25:47,403 --> 00:25:48,599
That's just a...

489
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,684
That's a joke.

490
00:25:51,033 --> 00:25:52,052
Sorry.

491
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:55,993
Jonas, why don't you come back to
ours for a nightcap, if you want?

492
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,246
Yeah.

493
00:25:58,259 --> 00:25:59,505
KNOCKING AT DOOR

494
00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:03,223
Now, ignore the joke. Who's
more keen for him to come back?

495
00:26:03,246 --> 00:26:04,676
I don't know.

496
00:26:04,678 --> 00:26:05,934
You do know, Gina.

497
00:26:06,162 --> 00:26:08,089
I'm so sorry, he's really hungover.

498
00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:09,483
That's OK.

499
00:26:23,083 --> 00:26:25,625
I'm staying faithful to
my corn flakes right now.

500
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:27,079
LAUGHTER

501
00:26:27,723 --> 00:26:29,558
That is just objectively not funny.

502
00:26:29,582 --> 00:26:31,557
Anyone would say,
"That's not funny."

503
00:26:31,632 --> 00:26:33,309
That was fucking embarrassing.

504
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,999
Whatever you're queuing up, stop it.

505
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,508
Sit down, please.

506
00:26:50,163 --> 00:26:51,519
You see that?

507
00:26:52,163 --> 00:26:54,072
You know Geoff?

508
00:26:54,096 --> 00:26:57,039
Yeah, you remember me and Geoff,
because he would have shown you

509
00:26:57,416 --> 00:27:01,039
a re-do of the side of his fridge,
something like that.

510
00:27:01,697 --> 00:27:03,758
- Spot the difference.
- You're drunk.

511
00:27:03,883 --> 00:27:06,839
I'm the difference.
He's the greatest guy in the world

512
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:09,199
and then I arrived and... you clam.

513
00:27:09,949 --> 00:27:11,255
For clarity.

514
00:27:13,453 --> 00:27:15,319
We're just talking!

515
00:27:15,878 --> 00:27:18,797
But moments later, you're so stiff.

516
00:27:18,922 --> 00:27:20,447
I don't know, a re-do...

517
00:27:20,462 --> 00:27:22,588
You don't know how
to stand around him.

518
00:27:22,601 --> 00:27:25,039
Your gauges are all over the place,
hot and cold.

519
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,479
This is just stupid!

520
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,564
You can't hide it.
Not completely.

521
00:27:29,589 --> 00:27:31,169
See how you look at him.

522
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:35,439
The less the relationship means,
the more you spend on the wedding.

523
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:38,719
Really, you start obsessing
about these tiny little details

524
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:41,519
like the thickness
of the wedding invitation paper.

525
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:44,239
Now, how you look at me.

526
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,759
I think it's an interesting choice,
going grainless.

527
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,119
It's a brave choice.

528
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:51,639
I'm sorry, but...

529
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:54,719
Tell me you look at me nice
like you look at him. You can't.

530
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,319
And how am I looking
at you now, Liam?

531
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:59,319
How long did you go out
with him for?

532
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:01,336
Does it matter?

533
00:28:03,264 --> 00:28:06,159
FILM REWINDING

534
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:09,959
You know, half the organic
memories you have are junk.

535
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:12,751
Just not trustworthy.
When it comes to little things.

536
00:28:12,776 --> 00:28:14,119
And big ones.

537
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,401
Is that Marrakesh?

538
00:28:18,123 --> 00:28:20,542
Does that look like Marrakesh?

539
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:24,959
No.

540
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,959
It's not Marrakesh.

541
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:30,959
So, how long did you
go out with him for?

542
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:35,757
All right, about six months.

543
00:28:39,271 --> 00:28:42,035
So not a week or a month.
Six months.

544
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:44,531
The ever-inflating romance.

545
00:28:44,532 --> 00:28:46,479
You're probably still
going out with him.

546
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,077
Why am I on trial here?

547
00:28:48,724 --> 00:28:50,159
What's been going on?

548
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:52,239
Nothing has been going on.

549
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:56,674
It was... Christ, you know how it
is when you first get with someone

550
00:28:56,675 --> 00:28:59,995
and then previous
boyfriends come up.

551
00:28:59,996 --> 00:29:02,288
He was never a boyfriend,
he was always a weird week.

552
00:29:02,302 --> 00:29:04,763
I downplayed it.
I fudged it, it was...

553
00:29:04,767 --> 00:29:05,638
You lied.

554
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:08,597
Not everything that
isn't true is a lie, Liam.

555
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,199
Hello?

556
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:15,383
So he was a bigger thing than I made
out and, yeah, he's sort of a dick.

557
00:29:15,443 --> 00:29:16,825
Sort of? He's a massive...

558
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:18,639
I liked him then.

559
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:22,312
And I don't like him,
not like that, not now.

560
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:25,857
So, just to get this clear.

561
00:29:25,982 --> 00:29:28,779
He fucks you, gets footage
for his redo wank file,

562
00:29:28,792 --> 00:29:29,735
but you're still pally.

563
00:29:29,747 --> 00:29:30,717
This is sad!

564
00:29:30,753 --> 00:29:32,735
- Cos if he was...
- This is just sad!

565
00:29:32,736 --> 00:29:34,577
He probably sits there
and tosses himself

566
00:29:34,578 --> 00:29:36,112
off all over his
cashmere blanket.

567
00:29:36,137 --> 00:29:37,381
It was years ago!

568
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:39,756
Not for him.

569
00:29:40,963 --> 00:29:44,417
I'd find myself watching
redos of really hot times

570
00:29:44,430 --> 00:29:46,245
early in relationships.

571
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:47,519
'Easy.'

572
00:29:48,394 --> 00:29:50,718
Sober up.
Make yourself puke.

573
00:29:50,843 --> 00:29:53,397
Whatever, I don't care.
Just sort this out.

574
00:29:54,387 --> 00:29:55,463
Fuck.

575
00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:00,572
I'd find myself watching
redos of really hot times

576
00:30:00,585 --> 00:30:02,736
early in relationships.

577
00:30:02,758 --> 00:30:04,064
Easy.

578
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:10,399
And I'm downstairs watching
some redo of some night

579
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:13,559
I've picked up somebody else and...

580
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:17,039
Yeah, nice, Geoff. She's upstairs
waiting to have sex with me

581
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:19,719
and I'm downstairs watching
some redo

582
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,879
of some night I've picked
up somebody else.

583
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,479
Easy.

584
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:26,397
And I'm fucking pulling myself off.
I'm just saying.

585
00:30:29,772 --> 00:30:31,227
'Green warning.

586

BUZZER

592
00:30:59,954 --> 00:31:01,794
- 'Who's that?'
- It's Liam.

593
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:05,150
Liam from last night.

594
00:31:06,046 --> 00:31:08,957
'Liam. Is Fi with you?'

595
00:31:09,082 --> 00:31:10,678
She's not, no.

596
00:31:11,363 --> 00:31:14,210
'Sorry, Liam, mate,
is there something that you want?'

597
00:31:14,222 --> 00:31:16,634
Yeah, I just want to
come in and talk to you.

598
00:31:16,635 --> 00:31:17,840
Can you open the gate?

599
00:31:17,841 --> 00:31:21,334
(CLEARS THROAT) Yeah, sure.
I'll let you in.

600
00:31:21,459 --> 00:31:23,137
Nice one, nice one.

601
00:31:37,818 --> 00:31:40,056
- Hey.
- Hey.

602
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,479
What do you want?

603
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,813
I just want to come in
for a bit, dude.

604
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,997
That looks expensive.
Is that expensive?

605
00:31:48,014 --> 00:31:49,879
Look, Liam, it's morning, mate.

606
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:52,157
Fucking hell. Liam.

607
00:31:58,672 --> 00:32:02,266
Jonas, this is a nice place!

608
00:32:05,428 --> 00:32:09,942
Hey. Seriously, man, it's not cool
you just walking in like this.

609
00:32:09,957 --> 00:32:12,395
To be honest with you,
it's a little bit weird.

610
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:14,216
Is that a Marrakeshian lamp?

611
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,317
Liam, do I have to call Fi?

612
00:32:23,104 --> 00:32:25,442
Did you guys have a row
or something like that?

613
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:27,344
- Sit down.
- No, I'm all right.

614
00:32:27,593 --> 00:32:30,679
Go on, sit down. It's not
a bear trap, it's a chair.

615
00:32:35,665 --> 00:32:38,557
Do you want me to bounce this
off your fucking head?

616
00:32:42,202 --> 00:32:43,334
(LAUGHS)

617
00:32:43,806 --> 00:32:45,845
I'm joking, Jonas.

618
00:32:45,970 --> 00:32:48,639
Bloody hell, I thought you were
supposed to be cool, man.

619
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:51,398
I thought you were meant
to be fucking brilliant.

620
00:32:51,523 --> 00:32:53,233
What's going on?

621
00:32:57,226 --> 00:32:58,557
Yeah, figures.

622
00:32:59,070 --> 00:33:01,637
Get some good stuff
for the scrapbook?

623
00:33:03,108 --> 00:33:04,414
I think you should go.

624
00:33:04,762 --> 00:33:06,559
I don't blame you.
I would have.

625
00:33:07,395 --> 00:33:09,248
Tell you what, let's have a look.

626
00:33:09,583 --> 00:33:12,159
Go on, chuck it
on the screen, don't be shy!

627
00:33:12,455 --> 00:33:13,761
Come on!

628
00:33:14,323 --> 00:33:17,132
I'm fucking joking again, Jonas!

629
00:33:17,418 --> 00:33:20,913
For goodness' sake,
you need to grow a sense of humour.

630
00:33:21,150 --> 00:33:23,177
- He's uptight, isn't he?
- OK, Liam.

631
00:33:26,204 --> 00:33:28,281
- It's a lovely room, this.
- Thank you.

632
00:33:29,462 --> 00:33:32,310
Is this where you masturbate
to images of my wife?

633
00:33:33,403 --> 00:33:37,246
- Or do you do it in that room?
- OK, Liam, I want you to leave now.

634
00:33:37,371 --> 00:33:40,079
Do you sometimes start in here
and then finish in there?

635
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,386
The world's pretty much your oyster,
isn't it?

636
00:33:42,398 --> 00:33:43,816
I want you to leave.

637
00:33:48,863 --> 00:33:50,699
Well, that's a pity.

638
00:33:50,763 --> 00:33:53,396
- Come on, mate.
- All right, now, what are you doing?

639
00:33:53,406 --> 00:33:55,715
Don't do that.
Come on now!

640
00:33:56,095 --> 00:33:58,213
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

641
00:33:58,216 --> 00:34:01,955
- Jesus! Get out!
- Stand up, Jonas, come on!

642
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:39,867
Hey.

643
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,032
What do you want?

644
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:48,275
INDECIPHERABLE GIBBERISH

645
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:50,115
Don't do that.

646
00:34:50,139 --> 00:34:51,574
Come on, Danny!

647
00:34:51,598 --> 00:34:53,364
- 'What are you doing?
- 'What are you doing?

648
00:34:53,376 --> 00:34:56,601
'Jesus! Get out, you fucking prick.

649
00:34:56,625 --> 00:34:57,993
'Tell you what... '

650
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,385
Stop it!

651
00:35:05,822 --> 00:35:07,679
I tell you what you're going to do.

652
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:10,359
You're going to get every bit
of Fion you've got in there

653
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:13,399
and you're going to select it
all and you're going to wipe it!

654
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:16,125
Hello, police, I'm witnessing
a serious assault at five...

655
00:35:16,958 --> 00:35:18,102
'Wipe it!

656
00:35:18,227 --> 00:35:19,315
'Fuck off.

657
00:35:19,316 --> 00:35:21,439
'I don't have a brain chip
to show you.'

658
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,599
This is a bottle, right?

659
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:26,821
Either you wipe it or
I will fucking gouge you myself.

660
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:27,866
Jesus!

661
00:35:27,891 --> 00:35:28,923
OK.

662
00:35:29,376 --> 00:35:31,017
Just do what he says.

663
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,375
Not on your eye, in there.

664
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,919
On there!

665
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,179
He's doing it!

666
00:35:40,177 --> 00:35:42,266
Now, delete it all.
The lot!

667
00:35:43,184 --> 00:35:47,325
Or I will crack your skull
and I will gouge your fucking neck.

668
00:35:47,450 --> 00:35:48,764
I'm doing it.

669
00:35:57,512 --> 00:35:59,601
Stay away from my house!

670
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:13,559
'Now, delete it all.
The lot!

671
00:36:13,961 --> 00:36:18,313
'Or I will crack your skull
and I will gouge your fucking neck.

672
00:36:18,338 --> 00:36:19,718
'I'm doing it.'

673
00:37:06,454 --> 00:37:07,760
Liam?

674
00:37:09,115 --> 00:37:10,471
Where did you go?

675
00:37:15,493 --> 00:37:16,836
What happened?

676
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,239
Liam, what happened?

677
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:21,009
Did you use a condom or not?

678
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:25,776
Just say.

679
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,999
Liam, whatever you think...

680
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,332
Am I Jodie's father?

681
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,959
- Liam!
- Am I?

682
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,039
Yes, of course.

683
00:37:35,466 --> 00:37:37,919
- You sure about that?
- Yes!

684
00:37:38,582 --> 00:37:39,987
That's nice.

685
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,605
I always liked that picture,
didn't you?

686
00:37:47,289 --> 00:37:48,943
It's why I bought it for you.

687
00:37:49,801 --> 00:37:52,599
I never liked it.
Thought it was pretentious shit.

688
00:38:06,308 --> 00:38:07,900
'I'll tell you what you're
going to do.

689
00:38:07,925 --> 00:38:09,919
'You're going to get every
bit of Fion... '

690
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,279
' Christ, what have you done?

691
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,359
'Select it all... '

692
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,839
We're getting to the good bit.

693
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:16,902
'Hello, police, I'm witnessing
a serious assault at... '

694
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:26,039
'Now, delete it all.
The lot!

695
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:30,669
'Or I will crack your skull
and I will gouge your fucking neck.'

696
00:38:40,222 --> 00:38:41,938
18 months ago in this room.

697
00:38:53,261 --> 00:38:55,375
You know when you suspect something,

698
00:38:55,862 --> 00:38:58,577
it's always better
when it turns out to be true.

699
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:04,039
It's like I've had a bad tooth
for years and I'm just finally

700
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:07,657
getting my tongue in there and I'm
digging out all the rotten shit.

701
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,439
That's not what it looks like.

702
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,239
Oh, this did Jonas come round
to read you a story?

703
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:14,279
No, it was...

704
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,439
A story about fucking?

705
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,039
It was...

706
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:20,115
When all the Dan stuff was going on
and you'd walked out.

707
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,319
For like ten minutes.

708
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,155
For five days, Liam.

709
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,692
No call, no nothing.

710
00:39:31,229 --> 00:39:33,639
So you fucked him after four days?

711
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,119
That's heroic.

712
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:38,959
I mean, three days,
that's admirable, but four days?

713
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,759
I mean, you must have been gagging.

714
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:42,281
I was so upset.

715
00:39:44,565 --> 00:39:47,227
We went for a drink, I got drunk.

716
00:39:47,674 --> 00:39:49,465
It shouldn't have happened.

717
00:39:50,672 --> 00:39:52,177
I'm sorry.

718
00:39:54,324 --> 00:39:57,639
I'm so sorry,
I can't say anything else.

719
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:58,912
I love you.

720
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:04,159
Did you use a condom?

721
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,319
Yes.

722
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:08,084
Cos we didn't have any here.
We were trying.

723
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,719
He had some.

724
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,479
In his pocket?

725
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,862
In his car.

726
00:40:15,577 --> 00:40:18,097
Was it his decision,
or did you make him wear one?

727
00:40:18,222 --> 00:40:19,523
I made him.

728
00:40:20,390 --> 00:40:22,566
- And you saw him put it on?
- Yes.

729
00:40:23,014 --> 00:40:24,332
Show me, then.

730
00:40:26,023 --> 00:40:27,600
Show me on there.

731
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:35,473
I need to see it, Fi.

732
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:38,955
I deleted it.

733
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:42,559
I wanted it to go away,
I wiped the whole thing.

734
00:40:42,684 --> 00:40:44,135
- Did you?
- Yeah.

735
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:46,404
So there's just a blank
gap in your timeline?

736
00:40:46,529 --> 00:40:47,977
Yeah.

737
00:40:48,954 --> 00:40:50,358
Show me that, then.

738
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:56,179
Yeah, OK.

739
00:40:57,037 --> 00:40:58,541
I have to find it.

740
00:41:05,025 --> 00:41:07,015
No! No deleting it, not now.

741
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:09,079
No, no.

742
00:41:12,164 --> 00:41:13,557
It's still on there, is it?

743
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,737
I'm sorry.

744
00:41:20,016 --> 00:41:21,759
You have to show it to me, Fi.

745
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:22,959
Why?

746
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,355
Cos I want to see it.

747
00:41:26,874 --> 00:41:28,590
I love you.

748
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,687
Show it to me.

749
00:41:31,557 --> 00:41:33,199
No.

750
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,439
- Show it to me.
- No.

751
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:35,679
- Show it to me!
- No!

752
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:39,244
Show it to me! I want to see!
I want to see what he looks like!

753
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:44,095
This isn't me!
Look what you're doing to me!

754
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,785
Fi, I need to see it!

755
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:49,098
Please.

756
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:02,319
I need to see it, Fi.
