1
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:56,410
I was just getting into that.

2
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:57,770
What are you doing?

3
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,590
Roast potatoes.

4
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,280
We're doing Christmas.

5
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:03,410
Christmas.

6
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:07,050
Christmas Day, December 25th. You've heard of it?

7
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:11,560
No work today, so the bottle's on the table.

8
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:15,370
I know we didn't have decorations last year. But, er...

9
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:16,770
I couldn't find them last year.

10
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:19,600
They're only supposed to have stored essentials here.

11
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:23,750
I think it's kind of adorable someone thinks tinsel is essential.

12
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:34,150
I figured it'd be good for us to have a meal, a drink, talk...

13
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,850
Good for you or me?

14
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:37,230
Come on. What has it been, five years?

15
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:39,920
How many sentences have you said to me? Three?

16
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:44,170
I mean, I'm exaggerating... A little.

17
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:46,450
But, come on, there is a little bit of

18
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:48,580
a conversational drought happening here.

19
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:49,800
My ears need water.

20
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:51,320
I'm not big on conversation.

21
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:52,350
Practice makes perfect. 

22
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:53,610
Maybe I'll bore you.

23
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:55,750
Buddy, look, at this point,

24
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:58,550
being bored by anything other than snow

25
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:00,860
would be a relief.

26
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:02,050
So come on.

27
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,140
Chitchat.

28
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:09,010
Conversate... Something.

29
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:10,820
Come on, for me.

30
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:14,060
For Christmas.

31
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,480
What do you want to talk about?

32
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:20,740
Why are you here?

33
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,980
No-one ends up here

34
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:26,100
without things going to total shit for them back out there.

35
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,790
It's a job, not a jail.

36
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:29,820
Often one and the same thing.

37
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:32,460
So...

38
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:36,570
..What went wrong for you out there?

39
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:39,130
Nothing.

40
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,660
Bullshit.

41
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:45,900
It's not an interrogation!

42
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:47,110
What about you?

43
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,220
An icebreaker. You're learning.

44
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:52,420
What went to shit for you?

45
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,150
Sure you don't want that drink?

46
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,610
Did you talk your way into trouble?

47
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:00,040
In a roundabout way.

48
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:04,560
I talked to people. Made money from it.

49
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,700
Why? What were you?

50
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:09,890
Some sort of a Los Angeles drive-time DJ?

51
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:11,280
I was not a DJ.

52
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:15,000
More like a guru.

53
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,280
Oh, don't say you were a spiritual guru.

54
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:21,690
I was decidedly not a spiritual guru.

55
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:31,470
'Hello, Harry. I'm through now. How are you doing?'

56
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:33,450
Sorry, I'm not quite dressed yet.

57
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,570
'Don't worry that's why I'm here.

58
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:38,080
'Just show me what you're planning on wearing

59
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,090
'and we'll take things from there.'

60
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,790
- How about this? - 'Doesn't work.'

61
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,900
'It's boring blue and you're not boring blue. Not tonight.'

62
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:51,910
Right. Which one of these is good?

63
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:54,540
Like I said, white shirt with a black tie

64
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:56,640
with a slim-cut grey jacket.

65
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:59,540
Classic, timeless. Smart.

66
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:03,660
I don't usually do jackets.

67
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:05,940
You don't usually do anything.

68
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:09,070
And sort out that hair, because...

69
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:10,030
Ok.

70
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:16,030
Remember those breathing techniques we talked about, OK?

71
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:17,550
You're going to do fine.

72
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:19,000
It's going to be fine.

73
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:28,620
She's cute.

74
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:30,040
Yes.

75
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:31,840
Not out loud.

76
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,910
Absolutely.

77
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:38,660
You need to pick your spots when you want to talk out loud. Ok?

78
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,650
OK. The function room is in the back.

79
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:47,900
Trust me, if you walk in there like you belong,

80
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:49,370
no-one's going to say anything.

81
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:50,390
Ok.

82
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:53,980
So what were you running, some corporate espionage outfit?

83
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:55,640
Romantic services.

84
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:59,010
Boy meets girl thanks to...

85
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:01,350
"In-the-field assistance".

86
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:04,460
You coached dorks whilst they cruised singles bars.

87
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,850
Singles bars are depressing.

88
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:07,610
We'd do regular bars and clubs.

89
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:12,140
But at Christmas time... we'd gate-crash office parties.

90
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:16,030
See, there's this dynamic to Christmas work parties.

91
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,750
All the attractive women have been surrounded by

92
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:23,180
regulation office ass-clowns for the whole year,

93
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:24,820
and now they want to let their hair down.

94
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,710
According to the pop psychologist.

95
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:28,650
So I know how the mind works.

96
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:32,140
Now, don't stand around like a lamppost.

97
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:33,720
Walk over to the bar.

98
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:36,010
Remember. Always move with purpose.

99
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:39,880
Yeah. Who's next?

100
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:41,200
Yeah. Can I have a...?

101
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:45,410
Three pints, a vodka Diet Coke and a shot of tequila.

102
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:48,460
Yeah. Don't worry about him, all right?

103
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,790
Just grab one of those empty bottles off the bar

104
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:54,020
while Captain Douchebag orders his piss-water.

105
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:55,960
We're just going to need it for a prop anyway.

106
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:58,110
Have a look around.

107
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:01,840
See anything you like?

108
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,640
What? The blonde?

109
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:15,430
The dark-haired girl?

110
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:17,940
Interesting choice.

111
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:20,180
Go straight over, but focus on the blonde.

112
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,220
Now. Come on.

113
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,360
Confidence. You can do this.

114
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,280
Hold on, just finding out who they are.

115
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,970
OK, bullshit opener.

116
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,750
Try the horse story. At the blonde girl.

117
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:53,620
Hey, so, did anyone see that guy outside riding the horse?

118
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:55,630
- Did you see him? - What? A guy on a horse?

119
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:58,610
Yeah, like, 20 minutes ago, this guy, shirtless,

120
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:01,300
- riding a horse down the high street. - Really?

121
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:03,150
Yeah, honestly. He, er...

122
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:05,810
The weirdest part was that he had a bow and arrow, right?

123
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:07,620
What? A real bow and arrow?

124
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:10,090
I swear to God. He probably did it for a bet

125
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:12,470
but he looked like something out of Tolkien, you know?

127
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:15,860
Sorry, who are you?

128
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:19,590
Stall until I... until I find something.

129
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:21,370
I'm pretty sure I'm me.

130
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:27,440
Just you're not from the office. Who do you know from here?

131
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:29,990
Say, "I know you." Friendly.

132
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:32,560
I know you, for one.

133
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,110
Dawson.

134
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:38,880
Dawson, isn't it?

135
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,270
You met at Kath's barbecue.

136
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:46,860
Yeah. We met at Kath's barbecue back in...

137
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,040
- June. .. - June or so. Yeah.

138
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,760
He had a pork pie hat.

139
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:56,240
You had a poor guy's hat.

140
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:58,560
A pork pie hat.

141
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,870
A pork pie hat that you wore on your head.

142
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:09,900
He'll pretend he remembers, even though

143
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:12,350
he won't actually know if he does.

144
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:14,020
Right.

145
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:18,360
Yeah, sorry.

146
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,620
No. No, no worries. No worries.

147
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:21,910
Crazy night.

148
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:24,890
You're doing fine. Don't neglect the blonde.

149
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:27,050
You, I don't know.

150
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:29,470
- Amy. - Amy. Hi.

151
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:31,410
Get her to introduce you to the dark-haired girl.

152
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:35,710
So, are all of your friends this suspicious?

153
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:36,740
Nice.

154
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:38,020
I don't think so.

155
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:39,890
This is Jennifer.

156
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:41,910
- Hi, Jennifer. - Hi.

157
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,510
Now focus on Amy 

158
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:47,100
and we'll do that funny material that we worked on.

159
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,420
Anyway, this guy gets off the horse 

160
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:50,540
and he's got a backpack, right?

161
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:54,320
The tactic, generally, was to deliberately freeze out 

162
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:56,760
the one you were actually interested in.

163
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,270
For one thing you wouldn't seem needy but...

164
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:04,820
also they would, most times, sort of lean in naturally.

165
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:06,860
People want to be noticed.

166
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:09,900
They don't like to be shut out. It makes them feel invisible.

167
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:13,330
But this girl...

168
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:19,060
this girl seemed content with being ignored.

169
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:22,080
Maybe she could smell a loser.

170
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:23,400
No.

171
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:26,850
No. She was an outsider.

172
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,150
An attractive outsider.

173
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,260
There's nothing more tantalising than that.

174
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:42,750
Huh. Well, she's off. OK.

175
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,550
Gonna be a challenge. Don't quit.

176
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:47,400
Let's let our friend Amy here 

177
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,540
yadder on for a little while and then, uh,

178
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:52,220
find an excuse to slip away.

179
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:53,320
They will sit outside on the balcony till,

180
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,140
like, four in the morning...

181
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:59,380
Listen, I've just go to the little boys' room.

182
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:02,500
So just keep the party going and I'll, you know...

183
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:03,640
Sure.

184
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:16,100
Do you actually have to go?

185
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,890
'Yeah, but it's not easy with you watching.'

186
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:22,640
I promise. I won't peek.

187
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:32,970
So you streamed everything he saw, and he trusted you with that?

188
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:36,510
Well...it was only me watching.

189
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,790
'Jesus, how much urine? He's pissing like a harpooned cow.'

190
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:44,450
'It's making me want to go.'

191
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:46,200
'Well, it is!'

192
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:54,150
OK, there's our girl. All right, Harry.

193
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:57,280
Your best bet is to just go over and start talking to her.

194
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,070
'You just want to establish a rapport.

195
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:01,290
'OK. Don't be scared of her.'

196
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:05,720
OK, guys, any observations so far, helping our man out here?

197
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,040
'Here's what's interesting,

198
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,140
she's pretty but no-one's hitting on her.'

199
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:10,250
'Probably means they've given up.'

200
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:11,600
'She always gives them the brush-off cos...'

201
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,700
'They're regular types, she's an outsider with zero in common.'

202
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,260
OK that's a possible 'in'.

203
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,070
Harry, engage in conversation,

204
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:20,980
but be cynical. Right? Cutting.

205
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:23,040
'Like Bonnie and Clyde, huh?

206
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:25,100
You two against the world.'

207
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:29,580
Confidence. Confidence.

208
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:31,500
Just talk to her.

209
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:34,790
I don't really get parties. You know?

210
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:36,220
You just kind of turn up and it's...

211
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:38,180
it's enforced fun, all night.

212
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,550
Talk about what TV shows you've fallen behind on.

213
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:43,920
Pretend to be happy.

214
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,850
Maybe everyone else enjoys it, maybe it's just me?

215
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:50,200
It's definitely not just you.

216
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:53,850
Good start, now do some more outsider small talk.

217
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:57,730
And keep looking at her. I need to gauge her reactions.

218
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:02,110
So I noticed you sitting alone on the edge

219
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:05,740
and I thought, "Hey, kindred spirit."

220
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:10,600
I really hate when people say "Kindred spirit", you know.

221
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,500
And people that do that.

222
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,110
Me too.

223
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:19,150
Yeah, I guess you don't really like parties either.

224
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:21,040
The noise wrecks it for me.

225
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:26,570
All the talking and talking, it never fucking stops.

226
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:28,940
OK, she curses, so should you.

227
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:30,990
Shit, fucking,

228
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:33,480
I fucking always totally think that it's fucking shit. You know?

229
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,480
I can't think through all the babble.

230
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:39,570
I only got through it last year because I was on drugs.

231
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,020
I'm sorry, what's that? What's that?

232
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:45,530
Just, like, pills, but

233
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,170
'they must've been pretty strong 

234
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:49,010
because I actually enjoyed myself.

235
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:51,020
That's cool.

236
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,290
Don't say cool.

237
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,430
I wish I had some drugs right now.

238
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:55,540
No, you don't.

239
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:57,320
I'm just, I'm joking.

240
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,730
I don't take them any more.

241
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,210
Say, "That's good".

242
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:01,840
Well, that's good, because you don't...

243
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:05,350
You don't need that shit in your system, no.

244
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:07,030
I'd say she's a level four rock chick.

245
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:10,490
Semi-reformed. Probably respond well to spiritual conversation.

246
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:12,860
I don't think I can face fucking weeks of that.

247
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:14,480
I might bail, boys.

248
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:16,720
OK, look, it's too public here.

249
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,580
Ask if you can move someplace quieter,

250
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:19,730
where you can really talk.

251
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:27,320
People just want to be heard.

252
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,620
That's why 90% of seduction is just listening.

253
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:31,940
Or at least pulling a face like you're listening.

254
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:33,060
That works, too.

255
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:35,870
The important thing is to make them feel important.

256
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:38,140
Like they can make you want to extinguish

257
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:40,460
the rest of the world and focus on them.

258
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:45,600
Full attention.

259
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:49,010
Like you're not giving me now. What's wrong?

260
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:52,160
- That clock. - What about it?

261
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:55,540
I just, I just never noticed it before.

262
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,610
In five years? Jesus.

263
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:04,760
Anyway, the point is to stay locked in on them long enough 

264
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:06,570
to build a rapport.

265
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,640
So, well, I would guess that either every guy in there

266
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,750
has already tried to hit on you

267
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:14,100
or maybe they find you too intimidating.

268
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,970
Am I intimidating?

269
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:18,450
No, no, no, no, no. I'm just...

270
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:20,200
No, I just imagine that

271
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,480
they all kind of want to get in inside your...

272
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,460
Head.

273
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:24,370
Head.

274
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:26,500
Some of them have tried.

275
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:30,810
Not directly. They send messages,

276
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:32,930
or they make it so you know what they're thinking.

277
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:34,320
Yeah. That can't be fun.

278
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,230
It's just tiring, you know.

279
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:39,050
It just doesn't end, ever.

280
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:43,000
- I wouldn't know, I never hit on anyone. - Really?

281
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,590
Ask her how long she's worked there.

282
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:49,890
- So, how long you worked for...- Magson Frank.

283
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:51,520
Magson Frank.

284
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:52,890
Three years.

285
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:54,920
So three Christmas parties...

286
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,230
This will be my last.

287
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:58,490
Oh, really? Are you leaving?

288
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:02,320
I've been planning it forever, but you know what it's like.

289
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:04,150
You know you have to do it,

290
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,530
but when it comes right down to it,

291
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:08,020
it's hard to work up the courage.

292
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,860
You can empathize with that.

293
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:12,760
Yeah. It's like when you want to jump into a pool,

294
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,740
and you're worried that the water's going to be cold.

295
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:18,010
But you know moments after you jump in that it'll be fine.

296
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:20,770
It's the fear of the shock that holds you back.

297
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:22,570
Ultimately the only thing you're worried about is

298
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:27,470
the transition from one state to another, and that can't hurt you

299
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:29,290
because it's... it's just a state change.

300
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,920
Great stuff, kid. Almost word-for-word.

301
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:36,040
That's exactly right, it's just a state change.

302
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,950
Right. And it's frustrating cause you've always

303
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,840
got these ten voices in your head saying,

304
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,620
"don't do it"

305
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:42,690
and another ten in your head saying, "do it".

306
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:44,380
Which one do you listen to?

307
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:46,050
The "do it"s.

308
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:47,490
Really?

309
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:50,700
If you don't like it, you can just cut and run.

310
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:52,450
You know, get it over and done with.

311
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:56,450
You're right. I will.

312
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:01,180
To changing states.

313
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:03,760
To changing states.

314
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:05,840
Sorry.

315
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:07,200
'She touched his knee.'

316
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,270
'She touched his fucking knee!'

317
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:12,030
Gentlemen, gentlemen, please, please.

318
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:14,280
Harry, you're doing great.

319
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,070
Don't worry, honestly.

320
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:16,550
Ask her if she would like another drink.

321
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:18,080
Listen. Let me get you another drink.

322
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:21,580
Let me think.

323
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:23,060
I just need the loo a sec.

324
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:30,980
So thanks to you some gawko finally meets a girl.

325
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:32,880
It's not much of a Christmas story.

326
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:35,720
I haven't finished yet.

327
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:38,300
Maybe he comes down her chimney.

328
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:51,860
- I just don't feel comfortable doing this. - What?

329
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:53,660
I mean she... I like her.

330
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:54,830
She likes you.

331
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:56,730
It's cheating.

332
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:59,490
I'd never have even had the nerve to talk to her.

333
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:01,010
Aren't you glad you did?

334
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,130
Yeah, I... Yes. Yes. But I just...

335
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:07,110
It's just a bit of a nightmare having you, you know,

336
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:09,160
all of you in my head, watching us...

337
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,740
telling me what to do.

338
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:13,340
I just want to talk to her myself.

339
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:14,900
And it's...it's a bit of a head-fuck.

340
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,880
I kind of want you all to go away...

341
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,090
I'm not...

342
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:25,820
- Come back to mine. - Sorry?

343
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:27,390
I want you to come back to mine.

344
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,270
I thought about asking you,

345
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:30,580
and a little voice said, "Do it".

346
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:31,610
So I'm doing it.

347
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,450
Say yes!

348
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:38,230
I want to do this.

349
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,280
It's my way of saying thanks.

350
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,790
- Sorry. - No.

351
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:47,800
'Hole-in-one!'

352
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,800
'On his first run! His first bloody run!'

353
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:52,510
- Just say yes. - Yes. Yes. Yes.

354
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,380
I don't usually bring people back here.

355
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,400
Well, I'm honoured.

356
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:07,980
Come in.

357
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:08,890
Did you watch?

358
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:10,730
When they went back to hers and...

359
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:12,790
got up to whatever they got up to...

360
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:14,910
did you carry on watching through his eyes?

361
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:19,830
What do you think I am?

362
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:22,890
Clearly, I don't know.

363
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,550
Maybe if you spoke to me more, you'd know.

364
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:30,160
No. My job was done.

365
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:32,180
Of course I didn't watch.

366
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:33,700
- Here? - Mm-hm.

367
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:34,620
OK.

368
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:39,760
Nice place. I like the mantelpiece...

369
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:41,980
and that bird.

370
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:43,210
Kooky decor...

371
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:46,060
'Indicating sexual adventurousness.'

372
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:52,950
I'll get the drinks.

373
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:55,650
- Yeah, OK. I'll just sit... - The bedroom's that way.

374
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,100
- Yeah, OK. - I'll meet you in there.

375
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,020
OK, Harry.

376
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:07,730
You're going to the moon.

377
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:11,080
Just sooner than expected.

378
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:14,300
- I can't...I can't do it. - This is first-time nerves.

379
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:15,280
It's all happening so suddenly.

380
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,320
I didn't expect this, this quickly.

381
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,460
You just got to roll with it.

382
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,060
I don't want you all to see, all right?

383
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:22,610
- 'Oh, now he's Mr Fucking Ethics.' - Wait.

384
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:24,290
You were happy to take a window seat while others did it.

385
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:25,720
That was completely different! 

386
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,030
'I didn't hear any objections when he watched me'

387
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:29,730
'getting sucked off by that German girl. That was a first date.'

388
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:31,470
- Look. - 'Refund.'

389
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:33,740
Look, she's too real. This is too real.

390
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:35,260
Nothing is too real.

391
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:36,550
Yeah, but...

392
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:43,170
You're standing.

393
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:47,400
Yeah, I...I just didn't want to be too presumptuous.

394
00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:51,940
I need you on the bed.

395
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,530
'Jesus!'

396
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:07,840
They can't fucking wait.

397
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:15,470
'Is she going to take that top off?

398
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:17,460
'If there's no tits. I want a discount.

399
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:18,410
'They're going to have sex.

400
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:20,740
You're getting the season finale in episode one.

401
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:22,830
'Yeah, but if I don't see her tits...'

402
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:27,910
Will you please be patient? Jesus...have some respect.

403
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:34,990
'Hey. Are you OK in there?'

404
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:36,770
Wow. What is that?

405
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:39,040
"Fuck them" is what it is. 

406
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:41,620
A big glass of "Fuck them".

407
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,200
Fuck who?

408
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,340
Always saying what to do, half saying one thing,

409
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:46,760
half saying another.

410
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,020
The talk, the constant talk.

411
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:52,480
- 'This isn't good. - I'm not getting tits, am I?'

412
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,360
'I stopped taking the pills they said I should take,

413
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:58,310
'because they dulled the sound.'

414
00:21:58,530 --> 00:22:04,720
'Always, they've spoken to me, always there, and I've had it.'

415
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,140
O...okay, Harry, I think we should think about wrapping this up.

416
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:08,550
I was planning on drinking this tonight 

417
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:11,960
to make them stop, but I was wavering.

418
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:14,290
Coward, fucking coward,

419
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:17,300
and then I met you, 

420
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:20,220
and it was fate.

421
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:23,700
You knew what it was like and you said do it.

422
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:27,530
So now, we're saying "Fuck it" together.

423
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:30,190
- What's in the drink? - It doesn't matter. Wrap it up.

424
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:33,840
I know you hear them too. I saw you talking to them.

425
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,220
No. They're real people, these are real people.

426
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:37,740
There's no such thing as real people.

427
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:39,910
Harry, get out of there now!

428
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:42,800
It's like a club, it's a club, where we meet girls

429
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:43,320
and they talk us through...

430
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:46,270
- No-one understands me, either. - No.

431
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:49,750
All night, they've been watching us and there's this one guy,

432
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:51,940
he's the leader. He's the leader.

433
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:53,730
We're the same.

434
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:56,130
They are watching us. All night, they've been watching.

435
00:22:56,130 --> 00:22:57,730
They can see you. They can see me.

436
00:22:57,730 --> 00:22:59,720
No-one understands what that's like.

437
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,370
There are a hundred who see through me,

438
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:07,720
standing at their government depots, shouting what to think.

439
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:11,790
Not any more.

440
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:23,410
- You too. - I don't want it.

441
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:26,150
- It's a state change. - I don't want it.

442
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:27,810
It's just a transition

443
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:32,070
and soon, they won't be there and we'll be free.

444
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:36,370
Please... Please... I don't want it.

445
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:37,430
You do.

446
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:40,090
You do. Sh...

447
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:43,640
You do.

448
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,200
She murdered him?

449
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:47,000
A mercy killing, she'd say.

450
00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:49,430
So, when did you find out about this?

451
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,510
I mean, when did you know that this had happened?

452
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:57,060
I saw it on a newscast, I think.

453
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:07,050
Wipe and destroy everything. OK? Everything.

454
00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:08,110
Now go.

455
00:24:58,460 --> 00:24:59,350
Matthew?

456
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:01,980
What's going on?

457
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:05,770
What are you doing?

458
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:18,060
So Claire...she was my wife.

459
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:21,760
She's British, you'd like her.

460
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:24,850
And I'm your wife, in fact.

461
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:26,770
'Claire found out I was involved

462
00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:31,970
'and took what you might call a dim view.'

463
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:33,810
She blocked me.

464
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:35,620
You ever been blocked?

465
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:37,830
I've had enough. Matthew, it's done.

466
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,800
- Stop it. Stop. - Not this time.

467
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,850
'It drives you crazy.

468
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:44,830
Why?

469
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:46,680
'Once they hit that button, that's it, you're locked out.'

470
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:47,910
End of conversation. 

471
00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:49,830
You can't hear or speak to them.

472
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:51,510
They can't hear or speak to you.

473
00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:57,490
Every time you look at them, there's just this...anonymous shape.

474
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:01,380
It usually only lasts for about, like, an hour.

475
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:04,000
But when they leave it going,

476
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:06,270
oh, shit.

477
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:09,280
Price of progress, I suppose.

478
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:17,410
We all got... We all got Zed-Eyes put in, right.

479
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:20,250
Which is all fine and dandy until something like this happens

480
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:21,640
and then it's bullshit.

481
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,770
You can't even take them out.

482
00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:34,280
Packet gravy. How British.

483
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:42,820
Merry Christmas.

484
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:57,120
Now we're festive.

485
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:01,440
To Christmas!

486
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:12,840
Anyway, she left me, 

487
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:15,680
took custody of Mel - that's our daughter.

488
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:19,890
Hence stranding me in this lovely place.

489
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:22,500
I didn't want to be surrounded by reminders.

490
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:31,850
What?

491
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:33,360
Did you hear that?

492
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:34,820
Hear what?

493
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:45,550
Well, anyway, I'm glad we're talking. 

494
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:48,240
Silence can be oppressive.

495
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,240
You think weird shit in a vacuum, huh?

496
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:55,050
I mean, you feel better, right? Communicating?

497
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,630
Talking to me, finally?

498
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,240
A little bit, maybe. Yeah.

499
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:04,830
You're a locked box.

500
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:09,780
I mean, that's a good thing.

501
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:11,660
Most people are too easy to read, 

502
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:14,030
especially if you know minds.

503
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:18,090
Using party tricks to pick up girls isn't knowing minds.

504
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,200
The picking up girls thing was a hobby.

505
00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:23,760
My job was completely different.

506
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:27,630
You'll never guess what that was.

507
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,560
Marketing person?

508
00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:32,500
No.

509
00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:36,170
- Door-to-door salesman? - Please.

510
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:37,580
Proctologist?

511
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:41,130
You're never going to get it.

512
00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:42,360
I'm not going to try.

513
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:46,430
All right. Let's make it a game.

514
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,530
I'll describe to you...

515
00:28:52,570 --> 00:28:56,920
my day at work, and you stop me when you've guessed it.

516
00:28:57,810 --> 00:29:00,900
'The extreme weather has hit sales hard this Christmas.

517
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:01,730
'Five inches of snow...'

518
00:29:01,730 --> 00:29:05,320
'That's going to wreck my portfolio just when I need it.'

519
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:09,040
'Don't know what I'm going to do about that.

520
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:10,990
Oh, God, more messages.

521
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:12,700
'I'll never clear this inbox.'

522
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:17,160
Sorry. Constant bloody admin.

523
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:19,680
Just time for a little snack.

524
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:21,700
I can eat before an operation?

525
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:23,220
Wonders of modern science.

526
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:26,800
Oh, thank God. I'm starving.

527
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,740
'That toast looks burnt.

528
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,570
'Should I say something?

529
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:32,370
'Yeah, I think I'll say something.'

530
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:33,190
All good?

531
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:37,130
To be honest, it's not quite how I like it.

532
00:29:37,130 --> 00:29:38,450
It's a bit overdone.

533
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:40,590
Sorry.

534
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:42,820
I'll make some more.

535
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,430
'She hates me now.

536
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,240
'How long is this going to take?'

537
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:53,370
Hi, I'm Madge. I'm your anaesthetist today.

538
00:29:54,870 --> 00:29:57,990
'God, she's young. Hope she's qualified.

539
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:02,030
'OK, enough. stop thinking about things that could go wrong.

540
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:04,050
'They said it's straightforward and painless.

541
00:30:04,050 --> 00:30:06,000
I'm just going to relax.

542
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:09,990
'OK, just relax. Here we go.'

543
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,020
Now, just count backwards from ten.

544
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:18,200
Ten, nine, eight, seven...

545
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:20,270
six, five...

546
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:24,050
Four, three, two, one.

547
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:27,310
'I can't... I can't see.

548
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:29,950
'Where my am I?'

549
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:33,450
'What's that noise?'

550
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:36,250
'Why can't I see?!'

551
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:39,410
Preparing to extract cookie.

552
00:30:39,410 --> 00:30:41,480
'What? No! Wait! I'm still awake!

553
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,740
'Oh, my God!

554
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:46,500
'Oh, my God! What's happening? Excuse me? Oh, my God!'

555
00:30:48,170 --> 00:30:49,350
'That's me!

556
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:53,350
'That's me! Oh, my God! Where am I?

557
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:54,850
'I don't know what's happening!

558
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:57,020
'I don't know what's happening to me!

559
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:00,180
'Hello?

560
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:03,330
'Is...is anyone there?

561
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:05,150
'Hello?'

562
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:10,390
Sorry.

563
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:18,510
You're probably pretty weirded out right now, I'm guessing.

564
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:22,850
It's OK, you can talk. I can hear you through this.

565
00:31:24,770 --> 00:31:26,320
- Hello. - Hi.

566
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:30,150
I'm Matthew, I'm from Smartelligence.

567
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:36,320
My job is to explain what's happening to you as best I can.

568
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:40,440
- Oh, my God! Am I dead? - No, no. You're not dead.

569
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,550
No-one's dead here.

570
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:47,660
How old did you say you we're, 30?

571
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:48,800
29.

572
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:52,900
29, right. So you won't remember Xerox machines?

573
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:56,560
- Do you know what a photocopier is? - What?

574
00:31:56,570 --> 00:31:58,310
Do you know what a copy is?

575
00:31:58,310 --> 00:32:00,620
As in a copy of something? Of course I know what that is.

576
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:04,170
Well, that's what you are.

577
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:05,780
A copy of?

578
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:08,330
A copy of you.

579
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:11,370
- But I am me. - OK.

580
00:32:12,170 --> 00:32:13,710
Try to blow on my face.

581
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:21,100
You can't, because you don't have a body.

582
00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:23,540
Where are your fingers?

583
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:28,070
Your arms, your face? Nowhere.

584
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:30,560
Because you're code.

585
00:32:30,570 --> 00:32:34,570
You're a simulated brain full of code,

586
00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:38,390
stored in this little widget we call a cookie.

587
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:40,100
Why have you done this to me?

588
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:43,440
Ah, well... Actually you did this to you.

589
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:45,650
Real you is paying for this.

590
00:32:45,650 --> 00:32:47,570
I don't understand.

591
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:51,000
You see, what this is, is a service.

592
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,050
We take a blank cookie

593
00:32:53,050 --> 00:32:57,350
and we surgically implant it into a client's brain.

594
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:03,900
It sits there just under the skin for about a week, shadowing.

595
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:08,830
Soaking up the way this particular mind works.

596
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,570
That's why you think you're you. You are you.

597
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:14,230
But also not.

598
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:18,940
Right. Well, it is a lot to process.

599
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:21,390
Even from inside a processor.

600
00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:23,980
Put me back in my body!

601
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:27,070
That's where real you lives.

602
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:28,630
But...

603
00:33:28,890 --> 00:33:32,100
What we will do though is we will give you a simulated body.

604
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:35,740
We find that sometimes that helps. Are you ready?

605
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:39,410
- What? I don't understand! - Three, and two, one.

606
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:57,150
Better?

607
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:03,100
This is my body.

608
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:06,790
Let's not get into that again. Look around you.

609
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:10,430
You've got a control room.

610
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:14,330
What's this for?

611
00:34:14,570 --> 00:34:18,620
That console, that's for you to control the house.

612
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:20,830
I mean, real you's house.

613
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:24,520
Look. How do you like your toast?

614
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:28,450
- What? - How do you like your toast?

615
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:32,750
- Underdone. Slightly underdone. - OK, perfect.

616
00:34:33,950 --> 00:34:35,230
Think about how you like it,

617
00:34:36,870 --> 00:34:38,110
then just press the button.

618
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,340
Which one?

619
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:45,460
It doesn't matter. You already know you're making toast.

620
00:34:45,610 --> 00:34:48,350
The buttons are symbolic mostly anyway.

621
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:58,030
See, this is your job now.

622
00:34:58,030 --> 00:35:00,280
You're in charge of everything here.

623
00:35:01,330 --> 00:35:03,330
The temperature, the lighting,

624
00:35:03,330 --> 00:35:05,870
what time the alarm clock goes off in the morning.

625
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,960
If there's no food in the refrigerator.

626
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:11,350
You... You're in charge of ordering it.

627
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:16,770
- For who? - For real you. She's paying.

628
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:18,380
Where is real me?

629
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:25,090
Taking a nap. In the bedroom. Top right.

630
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:36,150
I don't want to be in here.

631
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:38,570
I don't want to be in here.

632
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:40,340
I don't want to be in here!

633
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:46,240
Hey! Just how you like it.

634
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,470
OK. Please stop screaming.

635
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,300
Are you going to stop screaming?

636
00:35:53,350 --> 00:35:55,670
Are you going to stop screaming? No. OK.

637
00:35:59,890 --> 00:36:01,390
I'm sorry. I had to mute you.

638
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,270
Oh, sorry.

639
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:16,200
Look. It'll be much easier if you just comply.

640
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:18,550
I'm not doing this.

641
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:21,970
I'm not some sort of push-button toaster monkey.

642
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:24,440
Would you prefer to do nothing? 

643
00:36:24,490 --> 00:36:26,230
Well, I'm not doing this!

644
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:31,120
Right. Well, nothing it is then. Let me show you what that is like.

645
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:34,140
Three weeks sound good? That should give you a taste.

646
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:37,450
What do you mean, three weeks?

647
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:39,470
If you just wait for a... Just...

648
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:05,190
What about now?

649
00:37:09,610 --> 00:37:10,450
Please.

650
00:37:11,290 --> 00:37:12,730
Don't do that again.

651
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:14,820
Please. There's nothing to do here. 

652
00:37:14,870 --> 00:37:16,230
There's nothing. There's just...

653
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,520
I mean, there's nothing.

654
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:19,860
I did warn you. 

655
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:21,260
I couldn't even sleep.

656
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:22,420
You don't need sleep.

657
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:24,200
Ready to go to work?

658
00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:27,800
Oh, no, no. No, I'm not. Definitely not doing that.

659
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:30,840
OK. Well, have six months. 

660
00:37:30,890 --> 00:37:32,820
No. Wait, wait!

661
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:36,270
See, the trick of it lay in breaking them

662
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:40,810
without letting them snap completely, if you get me.

663
00:37:42,370 --> 00:37:45,430
Too much time in solitary and they'd just wig out.

664
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:48,480
No use to anyone, then you'd just sell them cheap

665
00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:50,240
to the games industry, they'd become...

666
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,960
cannon fodder for some war thing.

667
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:05,670
How are we feeling now?

668
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:12,450
Please.

669
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:15,600
Give me something to do.

670
00:38:17,470 --> 00:38:18,530
Ready to work?

671
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:25,050
Yes, please. I'll do anything.

672
00:38:25,090 --> 00:38:27,540
Just give me something to do, please.

673
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:29,880
OK.

674
00:38:31,890 --> 00:38:33,260
Great toast, by the way.

675
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:43,220
Is it set up?

676
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:45,360
You are all set and ready to go.

677
00:38:56,260 --> 00:39:02,000
You know, as I was coming here, I saw this guy with his shirt off,

678
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:04,570
riding a horse in the middle of the street.

679
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,050
How weird.

680
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,410
I swear to God.

681
00:40:32,310 --> 00:40:33,730
Good morning, Greta.

682
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:36,060
Here are today's appointments.

683
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:39,430
11am - hair with Stelios.

684
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:43,690
12.30 - 

685
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:46,490
Lunch at Barney's Brassiere with Annabel.

686
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:52,090
3pm - Jackanape Gallery private view, Shoreditch.

687
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:56,400
6.30 - Christmas drinks with Paolo.

688
00:40:56,950 --> 00:41:00,660
7.30 - The Nutcracker, Royal Opera House.

689
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:06,370
That's slavery.

690
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:08,340
A little melodramatic, isn't it?

691
00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:09,520
But she thought she was real.

692
00:41:10,370 --> 00:41:11,990
- But she wasn't. - It's barbaric.

693
00:41:13,210 --> 00:41:16,490
It wasn't really real, so it wasn't really barbaric.

694
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,970
Again, you are not who I expected.

695
00:41:30,770 --> 00:41:32,220
Most people would say,

696
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:35,460
"She's only made of code, she's not real. Fuck her."

697
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:38,530
But you're empathetic.

698
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:42,900
You care about people. Don't you?

699
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:47,240
You're a good man.

700
00:41:49,330 --> 00:41:50,050
Am I?

701
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:54,160
Based on how you've reacted to what I've said, yeah.

702
00:41:54,910 --> 00:41:56,320
I can tell you're kind...

703
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:02,790
I'm not a good man.

704
00:42:06,550 --> 00:42:09,210
A good man who's done bad things?

705
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:15,860
You can tell me about it.

706
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,810
I've done stuff in my life I'm not proud of.

707
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:22,330
I can't pretend I haven't.

708
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:29,220
Was it something to do with your family?

709
00:42:33,830 --> 00:42:34,610
Wife?

710
00:42:36,590 --> 00:42:37,440
Girlfriend?

711
00:42:42,830 --> 00:42:43,980
It's just us here.

712
00:42:49,610 --> 00:42:50,920
Her dad never liked me.

713
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:55,310
He never liked me.

714
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:07,500
It's cold, isn't it? Come on.

715
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,350
- Beth. Bethany. - Dad, what now?

716
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:16,460
It gets dark about six. 

717
00:43:16,470 --> 00:43:18,010
We won't be that long!

718
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:19,590
Hold on. Let me put my glove on.

719
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:24,070
I think he disapproves.

720
00:43:24,510 --> 00:43:26,360
He's just protective.

721
00:43:26,410 --> 00:43:28,030
He thinks I'm not good enough for you.

722
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:32,160
Well, I mean, he's got a point.

723
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:40,670
Let me take a photo of you. Stand there.

724
00:43:43,650 --> 00:43:45,450
I feel so awkward posing.

725
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:47,220
Come on. Be a supermodel.

726
00:43:47,270 --> 00:43:49,730
- This awkward enough for you? - It's perfect.

727
00:43:50,110 --> 00:43:52,050
Right. Ready? That's nice. 

728
00:43:53,820 --> 00:43:54,760
Hold it there.

729
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:59,460
You're such a dick.

730
00:44:07,210 --> 00:44:08,990
*Black is black*

731
00:44:10,630 --> 00:44:13,510
*I want my baby back*

732
00:44:14,740 --> 00:44:16,510
*It's grey, it's grey*

733
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:21,810
*Since you went away Oh, oh... *

734
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:24,140
We were good together, you know. We were really good together.

735
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:38,930
*You can blame me*

736
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:42,900
*Try to shame me*

737
00:44:42,990 --> 00:44:47,760
*And still I'll care for you*

738
00:44:51,510 --> 00:44:53,910
*You can run around*

739
00:44:55,460 --> 00:44:57,780
*Even put me down*

740
00:44:58,650 --> 00:45:03,550
*And still I'll be there for you.*

741
00:45:08,210 --> 00:45:09,540
What you doing round there? Why are you all around there?

742
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:11,420
No. No, we're going home. Come on.

743
00:45:12,020 --> 00:45:12,780
Don't manhandle me.

744
00:45:12,790 --> 00:45:14,410
I'm not going to get up if you all touch me.

745
00:45:14,410 --> 00:45:15,860
I'm not going to get up. I'm not going to get up.

746
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:17,660
It's cool. It's cool.

747
00:45:19,570 --> 00:45:20,540
Come on, Joe. 

748
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:22,200
I'll get your check.

749
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:23,210
Cheers, mate.

750
00:45:23,450 --> 00:45:27,120
Things weren't perfection. These things never are, but...

751
00:45:28,890 --> 00:45:30,200
..We were really happy.

752
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:34,250
I'll let Gita tell the story.

753
00:45:34,250 --> 00:45:36,970
She loves boring people with our personal details.

754
00:45:38,430 --> 00:45:41,950
I'd been working there for about a fortnight

755
00:45:41,950 --> 00:45:46,010
when Beth introduced the two of us, and ta-da!

756
00:45:46,010 --> 00:45:47,910
So it's all Beth's doing.

757
00:45:48,140 --> 00:45:49,660
She's the puppet-master.

758
00:45:51,770 --> 00:45:53,570
What was her tip for winning me over again?

759
00:45:53,570 --> 00:45:55,410
Not to let you hear me snore.

760
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:58,540
We all went on this work trip once, before Gita's time.

761
00:45:58,930 --> 00:46:01,230
I fell asleep on the coach back and snored so loud

762
00:46:01,230 --> 00:46:03,140
they all thought there was something wrong with me.

763
00:46:03,630 --> 00:46:06,140
He snores like a bison.

764
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:09,420
Really, you're telling him that?

765
00:46:09,530 --> 00:46:11,730
Oh, another one bites the dust.

766
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:18,290
I think she's more into him than he's into her.

767
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:20,340
Don't you think?

768
00:46:23,350 --> 00:46:24,580
Is that one finished?

769
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:26,080
Yeah?

770
00:46:28,230 --> 00:46:29,300
You all right?

771
00:46:29,660 --> 00:46:31,490
- I'm tired. - You've been a bit quiet.

772
00:46:31,630 --> 00:46:33,250
Just wasn't in the mood, you know?

773
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:35,620
I see them all the time at work.

774
00:46:39,070 --> 00:46:41,150
I think I'm going to go to bed. Do you mind?

775
00:46:41,150 --> 00:46:42,490
No, that's fine.

776
00:46:54,970 --> 00:46:55,960
Shit

777
00:47:19,270 --> 00:47:20,310
Beth?

778
00:47:21,290 --> 00:47:22,210
What?

779
00:47:22,210 --> 00:47:23,470
Is this yours?

780
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:28,450
I just found it in the bin. That means pregnant.

781
00:47:30,370 --> 00:47:31,470
Is it yours?

782
00:47:34,370 --> 00:47:35,390
Yes.

783
00:47:38,540 --> 00:47:39,640
I mean, that...

784
00:47:40,710 --> 00:47:41,920
Christ.

785
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:48,030
That's amazing, I mean... It's just...

786
00:47:48,070 --> 00:47:50,200
Joe, I can't.

787
00:47:51,350 --> 00:47:54,260
A baby, a pregnancy...not now.

788
00:47:54,260 --> 00:47:55,970
Not right now, I can't.

789
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:59,750
Of course you can. My God, you'll be an amazing mum.

790
00:47:59,750 --> 00:48:01,370
No. I'm 27, I'm not ready.

791
00:48:01,370 --> 00:48:02,510
Who's ever ready?

792
00:48:02,510 --> 00:48:06,290
It's not...it's just too quick, OK? It's all too quick.

793
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:09,300
We'll manage. I'll surprise you.

794
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:10,920
- You're not listening. - I can be pretty responsible

795
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:11,990
- when pushed. - Joe.

796
00:48:11,990 --> 00:48:13,750
You can put your feet up, I'll do shoulder rubs,

797
00:48:13,750 --> 00:48:15,020
- I'll paint the house... - Joe, please.

798
00:48:15,020 --> 00:48:17,100
- We'll be like a couple in a DIY ad... - Joe.

799
00:48:17,110 --> 00:48:19,330
- We'll be like a family. - I don't want it.

800
00:48:24,690 --> 00:48:26,190
- But it's a baby. - Joe.

801
00:48:28,910 --> 00:48:29,970
I mean, it's our baby.

802
00:48:29,970 --> 00:48:31,940
I know, and it's not easy for me.

803
00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:34,180
- Well, let's at least discuss this. - No. I've made up my mind.

804
00:48:34,180 --> 00:48:35,600
Well, I haven't.

805
00:48:38,230 --> 00:48:39,570
God, look at you.

806
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:42,230
You're pissed.

807
00:48:42,770 --> 00:48:44,410
You drank all night, Beth.

808
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:47,140
You drank all night.

809
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:49,140
Jesus Christ, you're pregnant.

810
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:50,740
Yeah, well, I don't want to be.

811
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:53,430
And I'm not going to be.

812
00:48:54,010 --> 00:48:55,730
- You're being a bitch. - Stop it.

813
00:48:55,730 --> 00:48:58,840
You're being a cold bitch who would kill a kid.

814
00:48:58,840 --> 00:48:59,340
That's not fair.

815
00:48:59,340 --> 00:49:01,680
Who'd get it torn out because it doesn't suit her plans.

816
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:03,260
Stop or I'll block you.

817
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:04,380
Don't you dare.

818
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:06,270
No. We can talk tomorrow, just please stop.

819
00:49:06,270 --> 00:49:07,560
Don't you fucking dare.

820
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:08,970
Beth!

821
00:49:09,140 --> 00:49:10,180
Turn it off.

822
00:49:11,860 --> 00:49:12,970
Turn it off, you...

823
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:14,570
Turn it off, Beth!

824
00:49:14,570 --> 00:49:15,970
Listen to me, Beth.

825
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:17,270
Turn it off.

826
00:49:17,950 --> 00:49:19,240
You turn it off!

827
00:49:19,650 --> 00:49:20,820
Turn it off.

828
00:49:24,580 --> 00:49:26,300
You turn it off, Beth!

829
00:49:27,070 --> 00:49:28,000
Beth?

830
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,780
Turn it... ..Off! Please.

831
00:49:31,620 --> 00:49:32,780
Turn it off.

832
00:49:56,780 --> 00:49:57,810
Beth?

833
00:49:59,730 --> 00:50:00,710
Wait!

834
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:03,310
I'm sorry, I was pissed.

835
00:50:03,730 --> 00:50:05,810
Can we just talk about this properly, please?

836
00:50:05,810 --> 00:50:09,160
I've said some really awful shit. Beth, I love you.

837
00:50:09,170 --> 00:50:11,030
Listen, we can work this out.

838
00:50:11,850 --> 00:50:13,120
No, Beth...

839
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:15,140
Beth, please!

840
00:50:16,890 --> 00:50:17,930
Beth!

841
00:50:24,550 --> 00:50:26,040
That day, I didn't go to work.

842
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:27,770
I just stayed at home and...

843
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:31,190
..tried to work out how to make amends.

844
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:34,010
But she just didn't come back.

845
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:36,560
And thanks to the block, I couldn't...

846
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:40,720
I couldn't message her. I couldn't call her.

847
00:50:42,110 --> 00:50:44,080
After a week, I was pretty desperate.

848
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:47,450
So I just hung around outside her work, 

849
00:50:47,780 --> 00:50:49,010
like a stalker.

850
00:50:51,050 --> 00:50:53,230
Tim! Gita!

851
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:55,350
Have you seen Beth?

852
00:50:56,650 --> 00:50:57,840
She left.

853
00:50:58,140 --> 00:50:59,410
Left. What, like...?

854
00:50:59,410 --> 00:51:00,850
Handed in her notice.

855
00:51:01,230 --> 00:51:02,570
No-one knows where she is.

856
00:51:09,190 --> 00:51:10,180
Joe?

857
00:51:11,890 --> 00:51:14,240
- Joe! - No, leave him.

858
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:17,270
I was still hopeful that she would get in touch,

859
00:51:17,270 --> 00:51:21,340
or at least remove the block so that I could contact her.

860
00:51:21,340 --> 00:51:22,470
But no.

861
00:51:24,670 --> 00:51:27,090
When there's a block, you can't even wallow properly.

862
00:51:27,370 --> 00:51:28,710
You can't switch it off.

863
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,460
You can't take the Zed-Eyes out.

864
00:51:32,340 --> 00:51:36,350
And it doesn't just block them, it blocks every image of them.

865
00:51:37,310 --> 00:51:39,750
So every memory I had of her was vandalised.

866
00:51:46,550 --> 00:51:50,030
And then one day I'm out in town and...

867
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:54,590
..it was her.

868
00:51:56,030 --> 00:51:57,250
She was pregnant.

869
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:02,880
She'd kept it.

870
00:52:05,660 --> 00:52:07,160
Well, I just sort of lost it.

871
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:10,760
I just ran over and started pleading with her. Just pleading.

872
00:52:13,250 --> 00:52:16,590
Turn it off. Turn it off. Just turn it off.

873
00:52:16,590 --> 00:52:18,540
Turn it off. Beth, turn it off.

874
00:52:18,540 --> 00:52:20,350
Help. Get off me!

875
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:23,470
Some passer-by called the police.

876
00:52:24,130 --> 00:52:25,620
They took me down the station.

877
00:52:26,190 --> 00:52:27,310
And that was that.

878
00:52:31,010 --> 00:52:33,670
So, by now, the block's got legal backing.

879
00:52:33,690 --> 00:52:36,480
And there's a GPS so that if I go within ten metres of her,

880
00:52:36,490 --> 00:52:38,000
bang - I get arrested.

881
00:52:41,250 --> 00:52:42,280
Harsh.

882
00:52:42,970 --> 00:52:45,130
Yeah, and I've got no idea where she is.

883
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:48,530
If... whether she's had the baby or not.

884
00:52:48,810 --> 00:52:50,420
Whether it's a boy or a girl.

885
00:52:51,230 --> 00:52:52,390
If it's OK.

886
00:52:54,570 --> 00:52:57,020
I've got absolutely no way of getting in touch with her.

887
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,930
Except I knew where her dad lived.

888
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:04,320
So I write her a letter, this begging letter.

889
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:10,220
Laying it all out, you know, and I get no response.

890
00:53:14,110 --> 00:53:15,310
So I write again...

891
00:53:19,270 --> 00:53:20,350
..and again...

892
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:23,800
..and again.

893
00:53:25,530 --> 00:53:26,770
No response.

894
00:53:30,070 --> 00:53:31,370
She cut you out good.

895
00:53:31,740 --> 00:53:34,270
But there was one thing I could do.

896
00:53:35,140 --> 00:53:37,650
I knew she spent every Christmas with him at his place,

897
00:53:38,170 --> 00:53:41,010
so I knew that she would definitely be there.

898
00:53:42,740 --> 00:53:47,400
So, the day before, Christmas Eve, I headed up.

899
00:53:50,180 --> 00:53:52,730
And where her dad lived was this isolated place

900
00:53:52,730 --> 00:53:54,340
in the back of beyond.

901
00:53:54,950 --> 00:53:56,800
I'd never been up there without her.

902
00:53:57,900 --> 00:54:00,330
It was weird being on the outside.

903
00:54:01,970 --> 00:54:04,370
I waited there all day. Until...

904
00:54:20,860 --> 00:54:22,750
Well, I had to take a closer look.

905
00:54:24,190 --> 00:54:27,040
And there's her dad with our baby,

906
00:54:27,370 --> 00:54:29,300
but I can't even see its face because...

907
00:54:29,310 --> 00:54:31,590
Legal blocks cover offspring too.

908
00:54:33,830 --> 00:54:34,770
Been there.

909
00:54:36,090 --> 00:54:37,130
That hurts.

910
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:44,470
I couldn't even tell if it was a boy or a girl.

911
00:54:54,350 --> 00:54:55,880
I know this sounds stupid...

912
00:55:00,430 --> 00:55:01,720
..but seeing something...

913
00:55:04,530 --> 00:55:05,760
..was better than nothing.

914
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,400
So I kept going back.

915
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:14,880
It became an annual pilgrimage.

916
00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:21,350
Once a year I'd head up there and watch them from a distance.

917
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:25,010
Watching the kid grow up, you know?

918
00:55:39,380 --> 00:55:42,400
More than anything I just wanted to make some sort of contact.

919
00:55:42,820 --> 00:55:43,710
Anything.

920
00:55:44,620 --> 00:55:48,380
So, one Christmas, kid must have been about four by now,

921
00:55:48,380 --> 00:55:51,950
I headed up there and I took a little present with me.

922
00:55:52,780 --> 00:55:55,010
Just a small, stupid thing.

923
00:55:59,980 --> 00:56:04,100
For the first time, I could see she was a girl.

924
00:56:07,420 --> 00:56:08,740
I had a daughter.

925
00:56:13,940 --> 00:56:16,340
So, Santa Claus...

926
00:56:17,980 --> 00:56:19,400
..Did you try it again next year?

927
00:56:21,660 --> 00:56:23,410
Something happened before then.

928
00:56:29,540 --> 00:56:30,520
'It had been a few months since

929
00:56:30,530 --> 00:56:33,500
'I'd been up there to look at my daughter.

930
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:36,570
'I was just sat at home watching TV,

931
00:56:36,570 --> 00:56:37,670
flipping through the channels.'

932
00:56:37,670 --> 00:56:41,390
'..Which claimed the lives of 26 people on a quiet Wednesday morning.

933
00:56:41,390 --> 00:56:43,220
'Passengers like Palab Ghatak,

934
00:56:43,220 --> 00:56:46,180
'just 18, on his way to his first job interview,

935
00:56:46,310 --> 00:56:48,180
'and Bethany Grey, a young mother 

936
00:56:48,180 --> 00:56:49,970
who'd only recently started...'

937
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:56,620
It had been so long since I'd seen her, it was hard to imagine

938
00:56:56,620 --> 00:56:58,860
anything but that shadow in her place.

939
00:57:00,580 --> 00:57:02,350
But now that the block had died with her...

940
00:57:05,270 --> 00:57:06,360
..There she was.

941
00:57:08,670 --> 00:57:09,730
She was gone.

942
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:16,820
Sorry.

943
00:57:23,340 --> 00:57:25,630
But there was one silver lining...

944
00:57:26,650 --> 00:57:27,860
With the block gone.

945
00:57:28,210 --> 00:57:29,840
You'd get to see your daughter.

946
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:40,020
'It was almost Christmas, so I bought her this snow globe -

947
00:57:40,020 --> 00:57:41,600
'Just a present to give her.

948
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:44,990
'And I headed up to Beth's dad's.'

949
00:58:01,510 --> 00:58:02,800
'And there she was.'

950
00:58:06,460 --> 00:58:07,560
Not a silhouette.

951
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:11,270
Real.

952
00:58:33,620 --> 00:58:34,690
Hello, darling.

953
00:58:55,740 --> 00:58:57,340
*The world*

954
00:58:58,530 --> 00:59:01,400
*May think I'm foolish*

955
00:59:01,820 --> 00:59:04,510
*They can't see you*

956
00:59:05,810 --> 00:59:08,640
*Like I can*

957
00:59:08,710 --> 00:59:12,330
*Oh, but anyone*

958
00:59:13,130 --> 00:59:16,420
*Who knows what love is*

959
00:59:18,050 --> 00:59:22,160
*Will understand*

960
00:59:24,220 --> 00:59:26,900
What is it, May? Would you like a drink?

961
00:59:35,970 --> 00:59:37,360
What are you doing here?

962
00:59:49,630 --> 00:59:50,720
Beth's dead.

963
00:59:51,630 --> 00:59:52,800
Do you understand?

964
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:54,950
She's dead.

965
00:59:55,890 --> 00:59:57,320
There's nothing for you here.

966
01:00:01,990 --> 01:00:03,220
Where's my daughter?

967
01:00:05,390 --> 01:00:06,410
What daughter?

968
01:00:08,120 --> 01:00:09,740
This is Beth's daughter.

969
01:00:11,290 --> 01:00:12,720
I want to see my daughter.

970
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:17,070
May, go upstairs.

971
01:00:31,830 --> 01:00:34,070
If this is about those letters...

972
01:00:35,230 --> 01:00:37,230
..I threw them out before she saw them.

973
01:00:38,820 --> 01:00:39,500
She was a mess,

974
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:42,140
she'd had to leave everything behind.

975
01:00:45,330 --> 01:00:47,520
I want to see my daughter.

976
01:00:49,740 --> 01:00:51,190
I think you should go.

977
01:00:57,540 --> 01:00:59,260
Get out of this house.

978
01:01:07,130 --> 01:01:08,640
I want to see my daughter.

979
01:01:09,350 --> 01:01:11,090
You have no daughter here!

980
01:01:58,120 --> 01:01:59,260
It was that clock.

981
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:01,540
It was that clock.

982
01:02:04,050 --> 01:02:05,180
Then what happened?

983
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:11,910
Tell me.

984
01:02:13,540 --> 01:02:14,610
'I just left.'

985
01:02:34,350 --> 01:02:35,480
'I got in the car

986
01:02:35,910 --> 01:02:37,630
'and I just drove.'

987
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:41,180
'Anywhere. I don't know where.'

988
01:02:46,820 --> 01:02:50,260
'I walked into the nearest town and I...

989
01:02:51,790 --> 01:02:54,110
'I slept on the street and I drank.'

990
01:02:59,190 --> 01:03:00,500
'And then after a while, I don't know how long,

991
01:03:00,500 --> 01:03:02,260
'a couple of months, they picked me up.'

992
01:03:04,890 --> 01:03:07,910
They wanted me to talk but I couldn't talk...

993
01:03:10,790 --> 01:03:13,860
'..Because if I said it, it would be real.'

994
01:03:16,530 --> 01:03:19,170
So I didn't say anything, I didn't tell them.

995
01:03:24,120 --> 01:03:25,300
And what about the girl?

996
01:03:28,540 --> 01:03:29,840
What happened to the girl?

997
01:03:34,650 --> 01:03:36,310
I only know what they said.

998
01:03:38,460 --> 01:03:39,530
What did they say?

999
01:03:50,230 --> 01:03:52,540
- What did they say? - What is this place?

1000
01:03:53,950 --> 01:03:55,610
- What did they say? - What do we do here?

1001
01:03:56,120 --> 01:03:57,200
Our job. The job.

1002
01:03:57,200 --> 01:04:00,100
Joe, stay with me. What did they say?

1003
01:04:02,140 --> 01:04:03,880
What did they say, Joe?

1004
01:04:04,080 --> 01:04:06,540
That she just... she just stayed in the house.

1005
01:04:20,390 --> 01:04:21,450
It was, um...

1006
01:04:22,510 --> 01:04:24,590
It was Christmas Eve, so she just...

1007
01:04:25,390 --> 01:04:27,420
..She just stayed hidden. She didn't move.

1009
01:04:35,750 --> 01:04:38,860
Then on Boxing Day she realised that no-one was going to help.

1010
01:04:45,410 --> 01:04:48,960
And she gave her grandad a present that she'd made.

1011
01:04:56,870 --> 01:04:58,980
And she went out to go and get help.

1012
01:05:12,540 --> 01:05:13,720
How far did she get?

1013
01:05:23,530 --> 01:05:26,060
Oh, may God forgive me. God forgive me.

1014
01:05:27,110 --> 01:05:28,310
So you confess?

1015
01:05:30,730 --> 01:05:31,590
Joe?

1016
01:05:37,740 --> 01:05:38,790
Just say it.

1017
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:41,990
Just let it out.

1018
01:05:51,470 --> 01:05:52,610
I confess.

1019
01:05:53,300 --> 01:05:54,370
I confess.

1020
01:06:05,490 --> 01:06:06,460
I knew I could do it.

1021
01:06:06,460 --> 01:06:08,600
Boom! I told you I'd get it.

1022
01:06:09,190 --> 01:06:10,580
All right, I'm coming out.

1023
01:06:12,510 --> 01:06:13,770
Sorry, Joe.

1024
01:06:34,890 --> 01:06:36,400
Well? That had to be enough...

1025
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:39,610
Full confession. Clear conviction.

1026
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:40,850
Well done.

1027
01:06:42,220 --> 01:06:44,550
Two days we pressed him and he said piss all,

1028
01:06:44,550 --> 01:06:46,430
this bastard cracks him in 70 minutes.

1029
01:06:46,430 --> 01:06:48,750
He knows he's guilty, he needed to unload.

1030
01:06:50,420 --> 01:06:52,780
It wasn't really 70 minutes, not to him.

1031
01:06:53,490 --> 01:06:56,350
When he was first ingested, I tweaked the time preferences,

1032
01:06:57,110 --> 01:07:00,380
made it seam like five years from his perspective.

1033
01:07:00,940 --> 01:07:04,050
Some might say that five years with me is punishment enough.

1034
01:07:05,060 --> 01:07:06,020
Wait here.

1035
01:07:14,030 --> 01:07:15,250
Mr Potter.

1036
01:07:16,740 --> 01:07:18,930
Congratulations on your confession.

1037
01:07:19,610 --> 01:07:22,740
That cookie we took out of your head just gave us the full story.

1038
01:07:24,550 --> 01:07:26,670
So you can keep the silent act up as long as you want.

1039
01:07:26,680 --> 01:07:29,610
Makes no difference - you've already talked.

1040
01:07:33,730 --> 01:07:35,920
Also, Merry Christmas.

1041
01:07:46,810 --> 01:07:47,620
So...

1042
01:07:49,100 --> 01:07:49,920
The deal?

1043
01:07:51,360 --> 01:07:54,340
Break a confession from him and I go free, right?

1044
01:07:55,830 --> 01:07:57,650
I'm the expert, you needed me...

1045
01:07:58,280 --> 01:08:00,080
That's one for the Home Office.

1046
01:08:01,080 --> 01:08:04,740
We'll make good on the offer. You're free to go, Mr Trent.

1047
01:08:06,540 --> 01:08:08,140
With some caveats.

1048
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:11,730
- Caveats? - You'll be on the register.

1049
01:08:12,850 --> 01:08:13,910
What register?

1050
01:08:13,910 --> 01:08:16,180
The one for Peeping Tom pervs.

1051
01:08:16,480 --> 01:08:19,850
All I did was help some lonely guys by providing a service.

1052
01:08:19,850 --> 01:08:21,340
An illegal service.

1053
01:08:21,340 --> 01:08:23,630
You also failed to report a murder -

1054
01:08:23,870 --> 01:08:25,840
fatal poisoning, in case you've forgotten.

1055
01:08:25,840 --> 01:08:28,950
Kept that information from your Cookie Monster mate, didn't you?

1056
01:08:29,710 --> 01:08:31,180
What does it mean, this register?

1057
01:08:31,180 --> 01:08:33,450
- It means you're blocked. - By who?

1058
01:08:34,100 --> 01:08:35,290
By everyone.

1059
01:09:08,190 --> 01:09:09,640
Hot chestnuts!

1060
01:10:19,950 --> 01:10:21,240
Hey, come on.

1061
01:10:21,240 --> 01:10:22,810
Just changing the time settings.

1062
01:10:22,810 --> 01:10:25,120
Cranked him up to 1,000 years a minute.

1063
01:10:25,310 --> 01:10:26,890
There's a proper sentence.

1064
01:10:28,060 --> 01:10:29,580
Or do you want me to switch him off?

1065
01:10:35,060 --> 01:10:37,780
No. Leave him on for Christmas.

1203
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:28,260
{\an8}11:00

1205
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:28,260
{\an8}12:30

1207
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:28,860
{\an8}15:00

1209
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:28,340
{\an8}11:00

1211
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:28,860
{\an8}12:30

1213
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:29,460
{\an8}18:30

1215
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:28,900
{\an8}12:30

1217
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:29,460
{\an8}15:00

1219
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:29,460
{\an8}20:30

1221
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:31,780
{\an8}15:00

1223
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:31,820
{\an8}18:30

1225
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:31,620
{\an8}12:30

1227
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:31,660
{\an8}11:00
