00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:13,633
A) I wouldn't.

186
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:17,836
And B)... I don't have
that clockage.

187
00:20:18,558 --> 00:20:21,089
It's, what, 12 mil just to enter?

188
00:20:21,133 --> 00:20:23,369
What kind of bike time is that?
Six months?

189
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:25,689
- Yeah, but...
- I'm hand to mouth.

190
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:29,709
I know people save and stuff
to get onto that stage

191
00:20:29,723 --> 00:20:32,327
and then there's what Selma did.
But, you know what?

192
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:35,716
- I'd rather not give myself...
- Yeah, but I'll gift it to you.

193
00:20:38,353 --> 00:20:40,031
The full 12, I'll gift it.

194
00:20:46,378 --> 00:20:47,769
Don't be ridiculous!

195
00:20:48,285 --> 00:20:50,113
Seriously, I've got it spare.

196
00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:52,589
You've got 12 mil spare?

197
00:20:53,256 --> 00:20:54,736
My brother left it me.

198
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:57,285
Own a channel, does he?

199
00:20:57,567 --> 00:20:58,873
No, he...

200
00:20:59,330 --> 00:21:00,639
He died.

201
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:05,878
He... He died last year,

202
00:21:06,374 --> 00:21:07,954
so it got transferred to me.

203
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:11,102
Just over six months' worth,
but I've kept it.

204
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:15,499
Why don't you spend it on you, then?

205
00:21:15,511 --> 00:21:18,322
And buy what? Some new shoes
for my doppel to wear?

206
00:21:19,634 --> 00:21:22,289
I don't know, upgrade your MOS...

207
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:24,283
Or get a Fat Attack season pass?

208
00:21:25,343 --> 00:21:27,169
Buy one of those wall buddies.

209
00:21:27,179 --> 00:21:30,587
The new ones that talk to you after
shutting and solve your problems.

210
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:34,594
They guide your dreams, like gurus.
It's amazing, really, what they can do.

211
00:21:34,619 --> 00:21:38,169
A mirror plug-in? That shows me how I
look as a werewolf? What's the point?

212
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:41,413
- I know it can be quite funny.
- It's all just stuff. It's...

213
00:21:42,854 --> 00:21:45,518
It's stuff, it's confetti, it's...

214
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:50,076
You've got something real.

215
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:53,813
What better to spend it on?

216
00:21:53,938 --> 00:21:56,002
You heard me singing in a toilet.

217
00:21:57,383 --> 00:21:58,689
Is that real?

218
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:01,168
More than anything that's
happened all year.

219
00:22:05,267 --> 00:22:07,879
I can't take that kind of clockage
off someone.

220
00:22:09,085 --> 00:22:10,838
It's 12 mils, no way.

221
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:12,821
Let me do this.

222
00:22:16,187 --> 00:22:18,774
I... I look around here, I just...

223
00:22:20,354 --> 00:22:22,542
I just want something real to happen.

224
00:22:25,194 --> 00:22:26,499
Just once.

225
00:22:29,546 --> 00:22:30,849
I'd mess up.

226
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:32,694
You wouldn't. I don't care anyway.

227
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:36,529
I'll go with you.
I'll be able to force you.

228
00:22:36,796 --> 00:22:38,425
I'll force you to go.

229
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:41,793
It's tomorrow.

230
00:22:43,641 --> 00:22:45,121
Come on!

231
00:22:51,762 --> 00:22:53,068
Say yes.

232
00:22:56,733 --> 00:22:59,007
I'll go as far as to say, "OK."

233
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:03,021
Which proves acceptable.

234
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:07,006
Thank God for that.

235
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:12,400
Walking away now.

236
00:23:13,756 --> 00:23:15,061
You loon!

237
00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:17,541
I can live with it!

238
00:23:21,850 --> 00:23:23,159
(SIGHS)

239
00:23:48,819 --> 00:23:50,995
I'd love to fucking ruin that
and all.

240
00:24:19,170 --> 00:24:20,476
What?

241
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:22,285
15?

242
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:27,167
A flippin' joke...

243
00:25:02,091 --> 00:25:03,397
(LAUGHS)

244
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:18,129
LOUD MUSIC AND SOUND EFFECTS

245
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:20,231
'New from Wraith Babes.

246
00:25:20,244 --> 00:25:23,502
'The hottest girls

247
00:25:24,603 --> 00:25:26,121
Oh, yeah! Ooh!

(SIGHS)

249
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:43,971
Can't believe I'm doing this.

250
00:25:47,187 --> 00:25:48,495
I am doing this.

251
00:25:52,073 --> 00:25:53,404
I can't be doing this.

252
00:25:53,429 --> 00:25:54,946
Can you trade it back?

253
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:56,695
The ticket?

254
00:25:56,988 --> 00:25:58,070
Don't be mad.

255
00:25:58,846 --> 00:26:01,445
It's a lot of pressure
to put someone under, you know.

256
00:26:01,469 --> 00:26:04,564
Don't think I'm not grateful.
But it's, it's just...

257
00:26:04,589 --> 00:26:05,895
You're babbling.

258
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:07,490
I'm babbling.

259
00:26:15,838 --> 00:26:17,330
I made you this.

260
00:26:20,887 --> 00:26:24,431
You never get to keep them more
than a day, but there it is, anyway.

261
00:26:29,163 --> 00:26:30,394
It folds flat.

262
00:26:30,812 --> 00:26:33,486
So you can keep them
in your waistband.

263
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:39,049
Thank you.

264
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:45,899
It's, you know...

265
00:26:46,202 --> 00:26:47,507
something.

266
00:27:17,856 --> 00:27:19,297
Face the screen, please.

267
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:25,699
Is he your Friends And Family
allocation?

268
00:27:26,571 --> 00:27:27,877
(Yeah).

269
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:29,570
Hand, please.

270
00:27:30,813 --> 00:27:31,814
Oh!!

271
00:27:32,236 --> 00:27:33,827
That's not permanent, is it?

272
00:27:33,952 --> 00:27:35,339
Oh, no. Two months max.

273
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:37,598
Round to the right,
and through the scanner.

274
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:43,246
VOCAL EXERCISES

275
00:28:02,076 --> 00:28:03,384
Where do we go now?

276
00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:05,328
You wait here.

277
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:07,681
How long?

278
00:28:12,342 --> 00:28:13,644
So, what do we do?

279
00:28:13,656 --> 00:28:14,939
I don't know.

280
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:17,875
Hey, hey, hey.
Fuck off.

281
00:28:22,743 --> 00:28:24,375
Her with the dark hair?

282
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:26,250
Yeah, yeah, yeah. The pretty one.

283
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,179
Yup. OK. Move.

284
00:28:30,543 --> 00:28:32,188
They want to preview you.

285
00:28:32,885 --> 00:28:34,619
- What?
- Preview. Come on.

286
00:28:35,068 --> 00:28:36,623
- He's with me.
- Hand?

287
00:28:38,545 --> 00:28:39,868
Show me your hand.

288
00:28:40,397 --> 00:28:41,699
OK. You, too.

289
00:28:41,824 --> 00:28:44,125
That's not fair.
She's new. That's not fair.

290
00:28:44,129 --> 00:28:45,639
I don't pick the order.

291
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:48,368
I've waited here all week,
and she's just walked in.

292
00:28:48,447 --> 00:28:52,262
Everyone will get seen eventually.
I don't pick the order.

293
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:53,746
But I'm a good singer.

294
00:28:53,754 --> 00:28:56,370
I can sing. I'm a good singer, I am.

295
00:28:56,371 --> 00:28:58,720
- Stand aside.
- It's not fair!

296
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:01,095
It's not fair!

297
00:29:06,908 --> 00:29:09,184
- Next lot.
- Stand there.

298
00:29:13,806 --> 00:29:16,324
Would you like to be as big as Salma
one day?

299
00:29:16,689 --> 00:29:19,553
Erm...
Yeah, I mean...

300
00:29:19,578 --> 00:29:20,819
Could you say that

301
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:23,417
as a self-contained sentence
into that screen?

302
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:28,459
I guess I'd like to be
as big as Salma one day.

303
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:30,419
OK. Proceed to stage area.

304
00:29:31,244 --> 00:29:32,550
Are we done?

305
00:29:35,586 --> 00:29:37,625
- Both performing?
- Just her.

306
00:29:37,638 --> 00:29:40,259
- Okay... and what are you?
- Singer.

307
00:29:40,593 --> 00:29:42,411
- Compliance?
- No, thanks.

308
00:29:42,536 --> 00:29:45,636
A-ha. Yes, thanks!
It's compulsory for all contestants.

309
00:29:45,649 --> 00:29:48,178
More to the point,
it'll stop you puking with nerves.

310
00:29:48,232 --> 00:29:50,428
- She's got to perform.
- Well, mmm(!)

311
00:29:50,851 --> 00:29:52,849
Look, just sip it, you'll be fine.

312
00:29:57,463 --> 00:29:59,457
Just a touch of light foam.
It'll pass.

313
00:29:59,582 --> 00:30:01,006
Make the most of it.

314
00:30:01,131 --> 00:30:02,977
You can't get this stuff
anywhere else.

315
00:30:03,424 --> 00:30:04,979
You OK?
Yeah.

316
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:06,289
You OK?

317
00:30:09,062 --> 00:30:10,377
Yeah. Just, erm...

318
00:30:11,492 --> 00:30:15,499
I don't know. Things are just
wider apart. I'm fine.

319
00:30:16,304 --> 00:30:18,865
- Really?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

320
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:21,186
Right. You're on.

321
00:30:38,946 --> 00:30:40,513
A little closer, please.

322
00:30:45,246 --> 00:30:46,577
Little closer.

323
00:30:49,788 --> 00:30:51,380
Into the light, love.

324
00:30:59,744 --> 00:31:02,952
- And who're we looking at here?
- Abi Khan.

325
00:31:03,586 --> 00:31:05,961
What are you going
to do for us today, Abi?

326
00:31:06,546 --> 00:31:07,939
I'm going to sing.

327
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:09,399
You speak up, love.

328
00:31:09,524 --> 00:31:10,870
We don't bite.

329
00:31:12,486 --> 00:31:13,792
I'm going to sing.

330
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:17,819
Hey, would you mind
lifting up your top for me?

331
00:31:19,372 --> 00:31:21,076
Can you take off your top?

332
00:31:21,091 --> 00:31:23,081
I want to check out those titties.

333
00:31:23,206 --> 00:31:24,262
Woo-hoo-hoo!

334
00:31:24,263 --> 00:31:25,571
Oh!

335
00:31:26,628 --> 00:31:28,331
Come on. Mucho feranto.

336
00:31:29,729 --> 00:31:31,358
Ah! No titties?

337
00:31:32,164 --> 00:31:34,303
She says she's here to sing.

338
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:37,259
I got to see
those titties, though.

339
00:31:37,384 --> 00:31:38,779
Come on, girl.

340
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:40,126
I mean, damn!

341
00:31:40,151 --> 00:31:41,499
Heh-heh-heh.

342
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:43,179
You hot.

343
00:31:43,656 --> 00:31:46,118

384

really hearing it.

You've got this pure beauty

397
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:27,250
What seems to be
a knockout figure.

398
00:35:27,946 --> 00:35:30,899
And this sort of interesting
innocence going on.

399
00:35:30,909 --> 00:35:33,359
That's something I think
Rafe's erotica channels

400
00:35:33,368 --> 00:35:35,019
could really play with.

401
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:37,539
Absolutely. That's what I thought

402
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:38,939
the moment I saw you.

403
00:35:39,117 --> 00:35:40,419
The moment.

404
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:44,299
I'd watch. I don't know a man here
who wouldn't.

405
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:46,775
To be honest,
some of us girls might join you.

Don't! Abi!

409
00:35:54,623 --> 00:35:56,850
No! Abi! Abi!

410
00:35:56,975 --> 00:35:58,979
I don't think that's quite...

411
00:36:01,305 --> 00:36:05,857
You will never have to pedal again.
Not one minute.

412
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:09,045
We could really work with you.

413
00:36:09,170 --> 00:36:12,315
Last year we had
singers, singers, singers.

414
00:36:12,676 --> 00:36:13,878
So many singers.

415
00:36:13,903 --> 00:36:16,737
So, to be a singer you have to be
truly exceptional

416
00:36:17,223 --> 00:36:20,939
There's just no slots left
for an above average singer.

417
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:23,659
Not for the next few years,
at least. Charity?

418
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:26,542
No. Saturation point, singer-wise.

419
00:36:27,514 --> 00:36:29,715
Listen. We said,
right from the start.

420
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:32,415
We'll go with something
different this season.

you dole it out in meagre portions.
