I was just getting into that.

What are you doing?

00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,790

We're doing Christmas.

00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,590
Christmas.

21
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:07,640
Christmas Day, December 25th.
You've heard of it?

22
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:11,880
No work today,
so the bottle's on the table.

23
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:15,310
I know we didn't have
decorations last year. But, er...

24
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,990
I couldn't find them last year.

25
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,510
They're only supposed to have
stored essentials here.

26
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,560
I think it's kind of adorable
someone thinks tinsel is essential.

27
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,200
I figured it'd be good for us
to have a meal, a drink, talk...

28
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,950
Good for you or me?

29
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,750
Come on.
What has it been, five years?

30
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,030
How many sentences
have you said to me? Three?

00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:44,030
I mean, I'm exaggerating...
a little.

33
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,070
But, come on, there
is a little bit of

34
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,430
a conversational
drought happening here.

35
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,630
My ears need water.

36
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,190
I'm not big on conversation.

37
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,910
~ Practice makes perfect.
~ Maybe I'll bore you.

38
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:57,960
Buddy, look, at this point, being
bored by anything other than snow

39
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,030
would be a relief.

40
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,870
So come on.

Come on, for me.

45
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,030
For Christmas.

46
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,080
What do you want to talk about?

47
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,150
Why are you here?

48
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,950
No-one ends up here

49
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,990
without things going to total shit
for them back out there.

50
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,710
It's a job, not a jail.

51
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,430
Often one and the same thing.

52
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,710
So...

53
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:37,910
.. what went wrong for you out there?

54
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,390
Nothing.

55
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:44,190
Bullshit.

56
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,830
It's not an interrogation!

57
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,470
What about you?

58
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,150
An icebreaker. You're learning.

59
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:54,150
What went to shit for you?

60
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:58,200
~ Sure you don't want that drink?
~ Did you talk your way into trouble?

61
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,910
In a roundabout way.

62
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:04,510
I talked to people.
Made money from it.

63
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,430
Why? What were you?

64
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,590
Some sort of
a Los Angeles drive-time DJ?

65
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:13,640
I was not a DJ.

66
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,030
More like a guru.

67
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,790
Oh, don't say you were
a spiritual guru.

68
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,840
I was decidedly not
a spiritual guru.

00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,790
Sorry, I'm not quite dressed yet.

72
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,630
'Don't worry that's why I'm here.

73
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,190
'Just show me what
you're planning on wearing

74
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,240
'and we'll take things from there.'

75
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:45,190
~ How about this?
~ 'Doesn't work.

76
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:49,240
'It's boring blue and you're
not boring blue. Not tonight.'

77
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,910
Right. Which one of these is good?

78
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,230
Like I said, white shirt
with a black tie

79
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,630
with a slim-cut grey jacket.

80
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:00,680
Classic, timeless. Smart.

81
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,750
I don't usually do jackets.

82
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,790
You don't usually do anything.

83
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,710
And sort out that hair, because...

84
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,670
OK.

85
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,710
HE EXHALES

86
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:15,760
Remember those breathing
techniques we talked about, OK?

87
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,750
You're going to do fine.

88
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,270
It's going to be fine.

00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,350
Yes.

92
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,550
Not out loud.

93
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,310
Absolutely.

94
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,360
You need to pick your spots
when you want to talk out loud. OK?

95
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,080
OK. The function room
is in the back.

96
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,830
Trust me, if you walk
in there like you belong,

97
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,470
no-one's going to say anything.

98
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,030
OK.

99
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:53,870
So what were you running,
some corporate espionage outfit?

100
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,950
Romantic services.

101
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,230
Boy meets girl thanks to...

102
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,230
"in-the-field assistance".

103
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,510
You coached dorks whilst
they cruised singles bars.

104
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,510
Singles bars are depressing.
We'd do regular bars and clubs.

105
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:11,560
But at Christmas time...
we'd gate-crash office parties.

106
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:16,200
See, there's this dynamic
to Christmas work parties.

107
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,710
All the attractive women
have been surrounded by

108
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:22,710
regulation office ass-clowns
for the whole year,

109
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,710
and now they want to
let their hair down.

110
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,790
According to the pop psychologist.

111
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:29,870
So I know how the mind works.

112
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:32,310
'Now, don't stand
around like a lamppost.'

113
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,750
Walk over to the bar.

114
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:37,800
'Remember. Always
move with purpose.'

115
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,030
< Yeah, who's next?

116
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,150
Yeah. Can I have a...?

117
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:45,200
Three pints, a vodka Diet Coke
and a shot of tequila.

118
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:49,030
Yeah. Don't worry about him,
all right?

119
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,390
Just grab one of those
empty bottles off the bar

120
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,990
while Captain Douchebag
orders his piss-water.

121
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,430
We're just going to need it
for a prop anyway.

122
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:00,310
Have a look around.

123
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:04,360
'See anything you like?'

124
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,750
What? The blonde?

125
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,710
The dark-haired girl?

126
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,990
Interesting choice.

127
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,390
Go straight over,
but focus on the blonde.

128
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,430
'Now. Come on.

129
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:26,480
'Confidence. You can do this.'

130
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:34,200
Hold on, just finding
out who they are.

131
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,470
OK, bullshit opener.

132
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:48,510
Try the horse story.
At the blonde girl.

133
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,560
Hey, so, did anyone see that
guy outside riding the horse?

134
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,670
~ Did you see him?
~ What? A guy on a horse?

135
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,550
Yeah, like, 20 minutes ago,
this guy, shirtless,

136
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,150
~ riding a horse down
the high street. ~ Really?

137
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,110
Yeah, honestly. He, er...

138
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,830
The weirdest part was that he
had a bow and arrow, right?

139
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,310
What? A real bow and arrow?

140
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,190
I swear to God.
He probably did it for a bet

141
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,710
but he looked like something
out of Tolkien, you know?

142
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,550
Sorry, who are you?

143
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,470
Stall until I...
until I find something.

144
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,270
I'm pretty sure I'm me.

145
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,190
HE LAUGHS

146
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:27,240
Just you're not from the office.
Who do you know from here?

147
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,710
Say, "I know you." Friendly.

148
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:34,760
I know you, for one.

149
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,470
Dawson.

150
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:41,110
Dawson, isn't it?

151
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:43,630
You met at Kath's barbecue.

152
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:46,710
Yeah. We met at
Kath's barbecue back in...

153
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:50,760
~ June. ~ .. June or so. Yeah.

154
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,470
He had a pork pie hat.

155
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,470
You had a poor guy's hat.

156
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,670
A PORK PIE hat.

157
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,720
A pork pie hat that
you wore on your head.

158
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,270
He'll pretend he remembers,
even though

159
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,870
he won't actually know if he does.

160
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,030
Right.

161
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,910
Yeah?

162
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,190
Yeah, sorry.

163
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,470
No. No, no worries. No worries.

164
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,910
Crazy night.

165
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:24,990
You're doing fine.
Don't neglect the blonde.

166
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,990
You, I don't know.

167
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,870
~ Amy. ~ Amy. Hi.

168
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:32,710
Get her to introduce you
to the dark-haired girl.

169
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:35,670
So, are all of your friends
this suspicious?

170
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,830
'Nice.'

171
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,230
I don't think so.

172
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,230
This is Jennifer.

173
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,950
~ Hi, Jennifer. ~ Hi.

174
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,950
Now focus on Amy and we'll do that
funny material that we worked on.

175
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,510
Anyway, this guy gets off the horse
and he's got a backpack, right?

176
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,190
The tactic, generally,
was to deliberately

177
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:57,240
freeze out the one you were
actually interested in.

178
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,990
For one thing you
wouldn't seem needy but...

179
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:04,040
also they would, most times,
sort of lean in naturally.

180
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,990
People want to be noticed.

181
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,470
They don't like to be shut out.
It makes them feel invisible.

182
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:14,520
But this girl...

183
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:18,760
This girl seemed content
with being ignored.

184
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,230
Maybe she could smell a loser.

185
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,150
No.

186
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:27,350
No. She was an outsider.

187
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:31,070
An attractive outsider.

188
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,120
There's nothing more
tantalising than that.

189
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:40,960
Huh. Well, she's off. OK.

190
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,470
Gonna be a challenge. Don't quit.

191
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:49,030
Let's let our friend Amy here yadder
on for a little while and then, uh,

192
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,430
find an excuse to slip away.

193
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:55,480
They will sit outside on the balcony
till, like, four in the morning...

194
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,230
Listen, I've just go
to the little boys' room.

195
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,630
So just keep the party going
and I'll, you know...

196
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,680
Sure.

197
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,190
Do you actually have to go?

198
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,240
'Yeah, but it's not
easy with you watching.'

199
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,800
I promise. I won't peek.

200
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:32,640
So you streamed everything he saw,
and he trusted you with that?

201
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:37,150
Well... it was only me watching.

202
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,200
'Jesus, how much urine?
He's pissing like a harpooned cow.'

203
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,630
'It's making me want to go.

204
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:48,680
'Well, it is!'

205
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:53,710
OK, there's our girl.
All right, Harry.

206
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,110
Your best bet is to just go over
and start talking to her.

207
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,790
'You just want to establish
a rapport.

208
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:01,630
'OK. Don't be scared of her.'

209
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,550
OK, guys, any observations
so far, helping our man out here?

210
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,750
'Here's what's interesting, she's
pretty but no-one's hitting on her.'

211
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,310
'Probably means they've given up.'

212
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,310
'She always gives them
the brush-off cos...'

213
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:15,070
'They're regular types, she's
an outsider with zero in common.'

214
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,630
OK that's a possible 'in'.

215
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:20,680
Harry, engage in conversation,
but be cynical. Right? Cutting.

216
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:25,040
'Like Bonnie and Clyde, huh?
You two against the world.'

217
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:31,430
Confidence. Confidence.
Just talk to her.

218
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:34,670
I don't really get parties. You know?

219
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,110
You just kind of turn up and it's...
it's enforced fun, all night.

220
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:42,110
Talk about what TV shows
you've fallen behind on.

221
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,710
Pretend to be happy.

222
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:47,390
Maybe everyone else enjoys it,
maybe it's just me?

223
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,710
It's definitely not just you.

224
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:53,760
Good start, now do
some more outsider small talk.

225
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:58,360
And keep looking at her.
I need to gauge her reactions.

226
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:02,950
So I noticed you sitting
alone on the edge

227
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
and I thought, "Hey, kindred spirit."

228
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,710
I really hate when people say
"kindred spirit", you know.

229
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:13,510
And people that do that.

230
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:16,590
Me too.

231
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,910
Yeah, I guess you don't
really like parties either.

232
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:22,110
The noise wrecks it for me.

233
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:26,150
All the talking and talking,
it never fucking stops.

234
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:29,230
OK, she curses, so should you.

235
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,670
Shit, fucking,

236
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,510
I fucking always totally think
that it's fucking shit. You know?

237
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:36,710
I can't think through
all the babble.

238
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:40,760
I only got through it last year
because I was on drugs.

239
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,030
I'm sorry, what's that? What's that?

240
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:45,110
Just, like, pills, but

241
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:49,160
'they must've been pretty strong
because I actually enjoyed myself.'

242
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,790
That's cool.

243
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,110
Don't say cool.

244
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,790
I wish I had some drugs right now.

245
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,390
No, you don't.

246
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,030
I'm just... I'm joking.

247
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,550
I don't take them any more.

248
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,790
Say, "That's good."

249
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,670
Well, that's good,
because you don't...

250
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:05,190
You don't need that
shit in your system, no.

251
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,990
'I'd say she's
a level four rock chick.'

252
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,310
'Semi-reformed. Probably respond
well to spiritual conversation.'

253
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:14,360
'I don't think I can face fucking
weeks of that. I might bail, boys.'

254
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,350
OK, look, it's too public here.

255
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:20,400
Ask if you can move someplace
quieter, where you can really talk.

256
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,230
People just want to be heard.

257
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,630
That's why 90% of seduction
is just listening.

258
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,750
Or at least pulling
a face like you're listening.

259
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:35,800
That works, too. The important thing
is to make them feel important.

260
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,150
Like they can make you
want to extinguish

261
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:42,200
the rest of the world
and focus on them.

262
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:46,670
Full attention.

263
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,870
Like you're not giving me now.
What's wrong?

264
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:52,670
~ That clock. ~ What about it?

265
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:56,190
I just... I just never
noticed it before.

266
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,750
In five years? Jesus.

267
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:03,430
Anyway, the point is
to stay locked in on them

268
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:07,190
long enough to build a rapport.

269
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:10,270
So, well, I would guess that
either every guy in there has

270
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,230
already tried to hit on you or maybe
they find you too intimidating.

271
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,750
Am I intimidating?

272
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,630
No, no, no, no, no. I'm just er...

273
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:21,670
No, I just imagine that they all
kind of want to get in inside your...

274
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,710
Head.

275
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:23,910
Head.

276
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:26,670
Some of them have tried.

277
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,990
Not directly. They send messages,

278
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,350
or they make it so you
know what they're thinking.

279
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,830
Yeah. That can't be fun.

280
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:36,230
It's just tiring, you know.

281
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:39,870
It just doesn't end, ever.

282
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,950
~ I wouldn't know, I never
hit on anyone. ~ Really?

283
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,150
OK, er...

284
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:47,350
ask her how long she's worked there.

285
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,510
~ 'So, how long you worked for...'
~ Magson Frank.

286
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,230
.. Magson Frank.

287
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,630
Three years.

288
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,630
Oh, wow.
So three Christmas parties...

289
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,710
This will be my last.

290
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,670
Oh, really? Are you leaving?

291
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,110
I've been planning it forever,
but you know what it's like.

292
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,390
You know you have to do it,
but when it comes right down to it,

293
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,030
it's hard to work up the courage.

294
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,590
You can empathize with that.

295
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:12,270
Yeah. It's like when you want
to jump into a pool,

296
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,710
and you're worried that the
water's going to be cold.

297
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:17,550
But you know moments after you
jump in that it'll be fine.

298
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,110
It's the fear of the
shock that holds you back.

299
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,510
Ultimately the only thing
you're worried about is

300
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:26,560
the transition from one state to
another, and that can't hurt you

301
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,990
because it's...
it's just a state change.

302
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,990
Great stuff, kid.
Almost word-for-word.

303
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:35,910
That's exactly right,
it's just a state change.

304
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:38,470
Right. And it's frustrating cos
you've always got these ten

305
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,750
voices in your head saying,

306
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,430
"Don't do it" and another
ten in your head saying, "Do it".

307
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,550
Which one do you listen to?

308
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,790
The "do it"s.

309
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,190
Really?

310
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,830
Yeah. If you don't like it,
you can just cut and run.

311
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:53,430
You know, get it over and done with.

312
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:57,480
You're right. I will.

313
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,310
Well.

314
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,230
To changing states.

315
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,350
To changing states.

316
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,150
GLASSES CHIME

317
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,750
Sorry.

318
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,830
'She touched his knee.'

319
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,430
'She touched his fucking knee!'

320
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,950
Gentlemen, gentlemen,
please, please.

321
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Harry, you're doing great. Ask her
if she would like another drink.

322
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:19,990
Listen. Let me get you another drink.

323
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,430
Let me think.

324
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:25,480
I just need the loo a sec.

325
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:31,070
So thanks to you some gawko
finally meets a girl.

326
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:34,110
It's not much of a Christmas story.

327
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,430
I haven't finished yet.

328
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,480
Maybe he comes down her chimney.

329
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,950
~ I just don't feel
comfortable doing this. ~ What?

330
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,710
I mean she... I like her.

331
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:54,870
She likes you.

332
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:58,920
It's cheating. I'd never have even
had the nerve to talk to her.

333
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,110
Aren't you glad you did?

334
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:03,830
Yeah, I... Yes. Yes.
But I just...

335
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:06,630
It's just a bit of a nightmare
having you, you know,

336
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,750
all of you in my head,
watching us...

337
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,710
Telling me what to do.

338
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,830
I just want to talk to her myself.

339
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,110
And it's... it's
a bit of a head-fuck.

340
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:18,190
I kind of want you all to go away...

341
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,240
Hey.

342
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:25,310
~ Come back to mine. ~ Sorry?

343
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,550
I want you to come back to mine.

344
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,390
I thought about asking you,
and a little voice said, "Do it".

345
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,870
So I'm doing it.

346
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:34,990
Um... uh...

347
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,430
Say yes!

348
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,870
I want to do this.

349
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:41,920
It's my way of saying thanks.

350
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:45,110
Sorry.

351
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,630
No.

352
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,750
'Hole-in-one!'

353
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,630
'On his first run!
His first bloody run!'

354
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:53,680
~ Just say yes.
~ Yes. Yes. Yes.

355
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,870
I don't usually bring
people back here.

356
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:06,870
Well, I'm honoured.

357
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,070
Come in.

358
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,390
Did you watch?

359
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,390
When they went back to hers and got
up to whatever they got up to...

360
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:16,440
did you carry on watching
through his eyes?

361
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,230
What do you think I am?

362
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,990
Clearly, I don't know.

363
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:26,670
Maybe if you spoke to me
more, you'd know.

364
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:30,470
No. My job was done.

365
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,630
Of course I didn't watch.

366
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:36,670
~ 'Here? ~ Mm-hm. ~ OK.'

367
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,750
Nice place.
I like the mantelpiece...

368
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,350
and that bird.

369
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,190
Kooky decor...

370
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:47,240
'Indicating sexual adventurousness.'

371
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,550
I'll get the drinks.

372
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:55,150
~ Yeah, OK. I'll just sit...
~ The bedroom's that way.

373
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,200
~ Yeah, OK.
~ I'll meet you in there.

374
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,470
OK, Harry.

375
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,550
You're going to the moon.

376
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,990
Just sooner than expected.

377
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:14,510
~ I can't... I can't do it.
~ This is first-time nerves.

378
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:17,470
It's all happening so suddenly.
I didn't expect this, this quickly.

379
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,830
You just got to roll with it.

380
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,590
I don't want you
all to see, all right?

381
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:24,640
~ 'Oh, now he's Mr Fucking Ethics.'
~ Wait. You were happy to take a window
seat while others did it.

382
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:28,880
~ That was different! ~ 'I didn't hear
any objections when he watched me
getting sucked off

383
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,510
'by that German girl.
That was a first date.'

384
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,990
~ 'Refund.' ~ Look, she's too real.
This is too real.

385
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,190
Nothing is too real.

386
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:39,240
Yeah, but...

387
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,990
You're standing.

388
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:47,040
Yeah, I... I just didn't want
to be too presumptuous.

389
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:52,150
I need you on the bed.

390
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:56,200
'Jesus!'

391
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:10,480
(They can't fucking wait.)

392
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:15,230
'Is she going to take that top off?

393
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,190
'If there's no tits.
I want a discount.

394
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:20,910
'They're going to have sex.
You're getting the season
finale in episode one.

395
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,150
'Yeah, but if I don't see
her tits...'

396
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:27,200
Will you please be patient?
Jesus... have some respect.

397
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,790
HE GAGS

398
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:32,230
HE COUGHS

399
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,630
'Hey. Are you OK in there?'

400
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,670
~ HE COUGHS
~ Wow. What is that?

401
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,720
"Fuck them" is what it is.
A big glass of "fuck them".

402
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,190
Fuck who?

403
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,510
Always saying what to do,
half saying one thing,

404
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:46,990
half saying another.

405
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:49,550
The talk, the constant talk.

406
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,430
'This isn't good.
I'm not getting tits, am I?'

407
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,510
'I stopped taking the pills
they said I should take,

408
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:58,310
'because they dulled the sound.'

409
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:02,360
'Always, they've spoken to me,
always there, and I've had it.'

410
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,670
Harry, I think we should
think about wrapping this up.

411
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:11,720
I was planning on drinking
this tonight to make them stop,
but I was wavering.

412
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,790
Coward, fucking coward,

413
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:18,840
and then I met you, and it was fate.

414
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,310
HE GAGS

415
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,510
You knew what it was like
and you said do it.

416
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:27,560
So now, we're saying "fuck it"
together.

417
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:30,270
~ What's in the drink?
~ It doesn't matter. Wrap it up.

418
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:34,030
I know you hear them too.
I saw you talking to them.

419
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,190
No. They're real people,
these are real people.

420
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,830
There's no such thing
as real people.

421
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:40,470
Harry, get out of there now!

422
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,590
It's like a club, it's a club,
where we meet girls

423
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,790
and they talk us through...

424
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,070
~ No-one understands me, either.
~ No.

425
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:49,670
All night, they've been watching us
and there's this one guy,

426
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,830
he's the leader.
He's the leader.

427
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,710
We're the same.

428
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,270
They are watching us.
All night, they've been watching.

429
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,230
They can see you. They can see me.

430
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,790
No-one understands what that's like.

431
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:03,510
There are a hundred
who see through me,

432
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:07,560
standing at their government depots,
shouting what to think.

433
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:10,870
HE COUGHS

434
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,190
Not any more.

435
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:16,240
HE CHOKES

436
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:23,310
~ You too.
~ I don't want it.

437
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,670
~ It's a state change.
~ I don't want it.

438
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,470
It's just a transition

439
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:32,230
and soon, they won't be there
and we'll be free.

440
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:35,990
Please... Please... I don't want it.

441
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,470
You do.

442
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,630
You do. Sh...

443
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:42,110
MUFFLED CRIES

444
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,710
You do.

445
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,390
She murdered him?

446
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,230
A mercy killing, she'd say.

447
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,430
So, when did you find out
about this?

448
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:53,480
I mean, when did you know
that this had happened?

449
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:57,710
I saw it on a newscast, I think.

450
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,430
HARRY SCREAMS

451
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:03,480
MUFFLED SCREAMING CONTINUES

452
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:07,150
Wipe and destroy everything. OK?
Everything.

453
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:11,200
Now go.

454
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:42,960
TOY SQUEAKS

455
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:54,600
BABBLE OF ELECTRONIC SOUNDS

456
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,030
Matthew?

457
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:04,430
What's going on?

458
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,110
What are you doing?

459
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:10,160
BABBLE OF SOUNDS CONTINUES

460
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,350
So Claire... she was my wife.

461
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:22,190
She's British, you'd like her.

462
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,950
And I'm your wife, in fact.

463
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,990
'Claire found out I was involved

464
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:31,830
'and took what you might call
a dim view.'

465
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:34,190
She blocked me.

466
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,510
You ever been blocked?

467
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,710
I've had enough. Matthew, it's done.

468
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:41,760
~ Stop it. Stop.
~ Not this time.

469
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,230
'It drives you crazy.

470
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46,870
'Once they hit that button,
that's it, you're locked out.'

471
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:50,030
End of conversation.
You can't hear or speak to them.

472
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,430
They can't hear or speak to you.

473
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:56,480
Every time you look at them,
there's just this... anonymous shape.

474
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:02,400
It usually only lasts
for about, like, an hour.

475
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,710
But when they leave it going,

476
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:07,310
oh, shit.

477
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:11,360
Price of progress, I suppose.

478
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:17,390
We all got...
We all got Zed-Eyes put in, right.

479
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:20,470
Which is all fine and dandy
until something like this happens

480
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,190
and then it's bullshit.

481
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:26,240
You can't even take them out.

482
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,960
Packet gravy. How British.

483
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:45,680
Merry Christmas.

484
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:58,800
Now we're festive. Huh?

485
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:03,400
To Christmas!

486
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:14,560
Anyway, she left me, took custody
of Mel - that's our daughter.

487
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,870
Hence stranding me
in this lovely place.

488
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:22,150
I didn't want to be
surrounded by reminders.

489
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:26,200
LOUD JANGLING CRASH

490
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:31,950
What?

491
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,470
Did you hear that?

492
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:37,520
Hear what?

493
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:47,720
Well, anyway, I'm glad we're talking.
Silence can be oppressive.

494
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,550
You think weird shit in a vacuum,
huh?

495
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:55,600
I mean, you feel better, right?
Communicating?

496
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,630
Talking to me, finally?

497
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:02,630
A little bit, maybe. Yeah.

498
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:06,680
You're a locked box.

499
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,110
I mean, that's a good thing.

500
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:13,950
Most people are too easy to read,
especially if you know minds.

501
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,950
Using party tricks to pick up girls
isn't knowing minds.

502
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,150
The picking up girls thing
was a hobby.

503
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:25,200
My job was completely different.

504
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:29,590
You'll never guess what that was.

505
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,350
Marketing person?

506
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,270
No.

507
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:36,030
~ Door-to-door salesman?
~ Please.

508
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:39,710
Proctologist?

509
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,110
You're never going to get it.

510
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:43,630
I'm not going to try.

511
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:47,680
All right. Let's make it a game.

512
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:52,870
I'll describe to you...

513
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:56,920
.. my day at work, and you stop me
when you've guessed it.

514
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,790
TV: 'The extreme weather has hit
sales hard this Christmas.

515
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,390
'Five inches of snow...'

516
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:05,950
'That's going to wreck my portfolio
just when I need it.'

517

518

about that. Oh, God, more messages.

'I'll never clear this inbox.'

520
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:17,790
Sorry. Constant bloody admin.

521
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,590
Just time for a little snack.

522
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,510
I can eat before an operation?

523
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,430
Wonders of modern science.

524
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:27,190
Oh, thank God. I'm starving.

525
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,110
'That toast looks burnt.

526
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,790
'Should I say something?

527
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,590
'Yeah, I think I'll say
something.'

528
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,310
All good?

529
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:37,310
To be honest, it's not quite how
I like it.

530
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,150
It's a bit overdone.

531
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,910
Sorry.

532
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,670
I'll make some more.

533
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:46,720
'She hates me now.

534
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:50,790
'How long is this going to take?'

535
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:53,750
Hi, I'm Madge.
I'm your anaesthetist today.

536
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:54,950
Hi.

537
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,910
'God, she's young.
Hope she's qualified.

538
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,630
'OK, stop thinking about things
that could go wrong.

'They said it's straightforward and
painless. I'm just going to relax.

540
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:10,750
'OK, just relax. Here we go.'

541
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:13,230
Now, just count backwards
from ten.

542
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:17,280
Ten, nine, eight, seven...

543
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:20,510
six, five...

544

Ow!

564
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:13,680
Sorry.

565
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:18,840
You're probably pretty weirded out
right now, I'm guessing.

566
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:24,360
It's OK, you can talk.
I can hear you through this.

567
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:27,270
~ Hello. ~ Hi.

568
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:31,320
I'm Matthew,
I'm from Smartelligence.

569
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:36,840
My job is to explain what's
happening to you as best I can.

570
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:40,550
~ Oh, my God! Am I dead?
~ No, no. You're not dead.

571
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:43,950
No-one's dead here.

572
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,000
How old did you say you we're, 30?

573
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,670
29.

574
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:53,150
29, right. So you won't remember
Xerox machines?

575
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:56,710
~ Do you know what a photocopier is?
~ What?

576
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,710
Do you know what a copy is?

577
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:01,110
As in a copy of something?
Of course I know what that is.

578
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:04,550
Well, that's what you are.

579
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,990
A copy of?

580
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:09,190
A copy of you.

581
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:11,950
~ But I am me. ~ OK.

582
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Try to blow on my face.

583
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:21,960
You can't, because you don't have
a body.

584
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,910
Where are your fingers?

585
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:28,960
Your arms, your face? Nowhere.

586
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:32,550
Because you're code.

587
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:35,310
You're a simulated brain
full of code,

588
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:38,830
stored in this little widget
we call a cookie.

589
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,030
Why have you done this to me?

590
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:43,670
Ah, well...
Actually you did this to you.

591
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,870
Real you is paying for this.

592
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:48,830
I don't understand.

593
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:51,830
You see, what this is, is a service.

594
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,910
We take a blank cookie

595
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:57,960
and we surgically implant it
into a client's brain.

596
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:02,200
It sits there just under the skin
for about a week, shadowing.

597
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:09,030
Soaking up the way
this particular mind works.

598
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:12,990
That's why you think you're you.
You are you.

599
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:17,040
But also not.

600
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:21,280
Right. Well, it is a lot to process.
Even from inside a processor.

601
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:24,310
Put me back in my body!

602
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:27,750
Hm. That's where real you lives.

603
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,110
But...

604
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:32,670
What we will do though is
we will give you a simulated body.

605
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,870
We find that sometimes that helps.
Are you ready?

606
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:39,920
~ What? I don't understand!
~ Three, and two, one.

607
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,950
Hey.

608
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Better?

609
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,390
This is my body.

610
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:07,440
Let's not get into that again.
Look around you.

611
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:13,080
You've got a control room.

612
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:14,950
What's this for?

613
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,870
That console,
that's for you to control the house.

614
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:21,190
I mean, real you's house.

615
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:24,990
Look. How do you like your toast?

616
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:29,040
~ What? ~ How do you like your toast?

617
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:33,790
~ Underdone. Slightly underdone.
~ OK, perfect.

618
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:36,550
Think about how you like it,

619
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:40,600
then just press the button.

620
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,110
Which one?

621
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:45,750
It doesn't matter. You already know
you're making toast.

622
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:49,800
The buttons are symbolic mostly
anyway.

623
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,550
See, this is your job now.

624
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:01,150
You're in charge of everything here.

625
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,750
The temperature, the lighting,

626
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:06,510
what time the alarm clock
goes off in the morning.

627
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:09,150
If there's
no food in the refrigerator.

628
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:12,910
You...
You're in charge of ordering it.

629
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:16,950
~ For who? ~ For real you. She's paying.

630
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Where is real me?

631
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:25,520
Taking a nap. In the bedroom.
Top right.

632
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:30,360
SHE GASPS

633
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,830
I don't want to be in here.

634
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,390
I don't want to be in here.

635
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:42,270
I don't want to be in here!

636
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,030
TOASTER SOUNDS

637
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:47,510
Hey! Just how you like it.

638
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:49,670
SHE SCREAMS

639
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:52,630
OK. Please stop screaming.

640
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,510
Are you going to stop screaming?

641
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:58,560
Are you going to stop screaming?
No. OK.

642
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:04,240
I'm sorry. I had to mute you.

643
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:11,840
Oh, sorry.

644
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:17,320
Look. It'll be much easier
if you just comply.

645
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:19,990
I'm not doing this.

646
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:22,710
I'm not some sort of
push-button toaster monkey.

647
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:26,750
~ Would you prefer to do nothing?
~ Well, I'm not doing this!

648
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:30,800
Right. Well, nothing it is then.
Let me show you what that is like.

649
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:34,910
Three weeks sound good?
That should give you a taste.

650
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:37,550
What do you mean, three weeks?

651
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:41,600
If you just wait for a...
Just...

652
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:08,440
What about now?

653
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,110
Please.

654
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,870
Don't do that again.

655
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:16,920
Please. There's nothing to do here.
There's nothing. There's just...

656
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,950
I mean, there's nothing.

657
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,630
~ I did warn you.
~ I couldn't even sleep.

658
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,510
You don't need sleep.

659
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:24,990
Ready to go to work?

660
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:29,040
Oh, no, no. No, I'm not.
Definitely not doing that.

661
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:33,520
~ OK. Well, have six months.
~ No. Wait, wait!

662
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,710
See, the trick of it
lay in breaking them

663
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:40,760
without letting them snap
completely, if you get me.

664
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:45,830
Too much time in solitary
and they'd just wig out.

665
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:48,830
No use to anyone,
then you'd just sell them cheap

666
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:51,230
to the games industry,
they'd become...

667
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:55,280
cannon fodder for some war thing.

668
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:08,920
How are we feeling now?

669
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:13,830
Please.

670
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:17,390
Give me something to do.

671
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:20,470
Ready to work?

672
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:24,110
Yes, please. I'll do anything.

673
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:28,160
Just give me something to do, please.

674
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:32,430
OK.

675
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:36,480
Great toast, by the way.

676
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:42,070
Hey.

677
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,550
Is it set up?

678
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:47,600
You are all set and ready to go.

679
00:38:56,760 --> 00:39:00,760
You know, as I was coming here,
I saw this guy with his shirt off,

680
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:05,030
riding a horse
in the middle of the street.

681
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:07,270
How weird.

682
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:11,320
I swear to God.

683
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:39,280
MUSIC: The Thieving Magpie
by Rossini

684
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:34,350
COMPUTER: Good morning, Greta.

685
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:37,030
Here are today's appointments.

686
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:41,080
11am - hair with Stelios.

687
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:46,920
12.30 - Lunch at Barney's Brassiere
with Annabel.

688
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:52,760
3pm - Jackanape Gallery
private view, Shoreditch.

689
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:57,320
6.30 - Christmas drinks with Paolo.

690
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:01,600
7.30 - The Nutcracker,
Royal Opera House.

691
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:06,950
That's slavery.

692
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,710
A little melodramatic, isn't it?

693
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,350
But she thought she was real.

694
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:13,390
~ But she wasn't. ~ It's barbaric.

695
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:17,440
It wasn't really real,
so it wasn't really barbaric.

696
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:29,800
Again, you are not who I expected.

697
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,030
Most people would say,

698
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:37,080
"She's only made of code,
she's not real. Fuck her."

699
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:40,430
But you're empathetic.

700
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:44,480
~ You care about people. ~ Don't you?

701
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:49,350
You're a good man.

702
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:51,470
Am I?

703
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:54,790
Based on how you've reacted
to what I've said, yeah.

704
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:58,840
I can tell you're kind...

705
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:05,520
I'm not a good man.

706
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:11,000
A good man who's done bad things?

707
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:18,590
You can tell me about it.

708
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:21,070
I've done stuff in my life
I'm not proud of.

709
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:25,120
I can't pretend I haven't.

710
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:31,480
Was it something to do
with your family?

711
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:36,470
Wife?

712
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:40,520
Girlfriend?

713
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:47,080
It's just us here.

714
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:53,680
Her dad never liked me.

715
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:58,120
He never liked me.

716
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:09,360
It's cold, isn't it? Come on.

717
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:14,720
~ Beth. Bethany. ~ Dad, what now?

718
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:18,110
~ It gets dark about six.
~ We won't be that long!

719
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:22,160
Hold on. Let me put my glove on.

720
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:24,910
I think he disapproves.

721
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,950
He's just protective.

722
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,830
He thinks I'm not good enough
for you.

723
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:33,880
Well, I mean, he's got a point.

724
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:43,240
Let me take a photo of you.
Stand there.

725
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,710
I feel so awkward posing.

726
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:47,590
Come on. Be a supermodel.

727
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:50,550
~ This awkward enough for you?
~ It's perfect.

728
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:54,600
Right. Ready?
That's nice. Hold it there.

729
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:00,050
You're such a dick.

Why are you all around there?

~ No. No, we're going home. Come on.
~ Don't manhandle me.

I'm not going to get up

I'm not going to get up.

Cheers, mate.

751
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:27,520
Things weren't perfection.
These things never are, but...

752
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:32,760
.. we were really happy.

753
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:34,390
I'll let Gita tell the story.

754
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:38,440
She loves boring people
with our personal details.

755
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:41,630
I'd been working there
for about a fortnight

756
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:45,680
when Beth introduced the two of us,
and ta-da!

757
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:47,950
So it's all Beth's doing.

758
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,230
She's the puppet-master.

759
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:51,310
LAUGHTER

760
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:53,670
What was her tip
for winning me over again?

761
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:55,830
Not to let you hear me snore.

762
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:58,670
We all went on this work trip once,
before Gita's time.

763
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:01,350
I fell asleep on the coach back
and snored so loud

764
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:04,110
they all thought there was
something wrong with me.

765
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:06,070
He snores like a bison.

766
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:07,870
Wow.

767
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:09,670
Really, you're telling him that?

768
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:13,720
Oh, another one bites the dust.

769
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:19,150
I think she's more into him
than he's into her.

770
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:23,200
Don't you think?

771
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:27,320
~ Is that one finished? ~ Mmm-hmm. ~ Yeah?

772
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:29,510
You all right?

773
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:31,670
~ I'm tired. ~ You've been a bit quiet.

774
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:33,990
Just wasn't in the mood, you know?

775
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:38,040
I see them all the time at work.

776
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:40,910
I think I'm going to go to bed.
Do you mind?

777
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:44,960
No, that's fine.

778
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:59,160
(Shit.)

779
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:21,270
Beth?

780
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:22,350
What?

781
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:26,110
Is this yours?

782
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:30,160
I just found it in the bin.
That means pregnant.

783
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:34,320
Is it yours?

784
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:38,440
Yes.

785
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:40,590
I mean, that...

786
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:44,640
Christ.

787
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:48,110
That's amazing, I mean...
It's just...

788
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:51,430
Joe, I can't.

789
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:54,390
A baby, a pregnancy... not now.

790
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:56,590
Not right now, I can't.

791
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:59,950
Of course you can.
My God, you'll be an amazing mum.

792
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,510
~ No. I'm 27, I'm not ready.
~ Who's ever ready?

793
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:06,560
It's not... it's just too quick, OK?
It's all too quick.

794
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,710
We'll manage. I'll surprise you.

795
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:10,110
You're not listening.

796
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:12,070
~ I can be pretty responsible
when pushed. ~ Joe.

797
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:14,110
You can put your feet up,
I'll do shoulder rubs,

798
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:15,710
~ I'll paint the house...
~ Joe, please.

799
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:17,510
~ We'll be like a couple
in a DIY ad... ~ Joe.

800
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:21,560
~ We'll be like a family.
~ I don't want it.

801
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:28,720
~ But it's a baby. ~ Joe.

802
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:30,110
I mean, it's our baby.

803
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:31,550
I know, and it's not easy for me.

804
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:34,230
~ Well, let's at least discuss this.
~ No. I've made up my mind.

805
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:38,280
Well, I haven't.

806
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:40,950
God, look at you.

807
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,910
You're pissed.

808
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:45,670
You drank all night, Beth.

809
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:47,590
You drank all night.

810
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:49,110
Jesus Christ, you're pregnant.

811
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:52,190
Yeah, well, I don't want to be.

812
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:53,950
And I'm not going to be.

813
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,750
~ You're being a bitch. ~ Stop it.

814
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:59,270
~ You're being a cold bitch who would
kill a kid. ~ That's not fair.

815
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:01,710
Who'd get it torn out
because it doesn't suit her plans.

816
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:03,030
Stop or I'll block you.

817
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:04,270
Don't you dare.

818
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:06,390
No. We can talk tomorrow,
just please stop.

819
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:07,710
Don't you fucking dare.

820
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:09,110
MUFFLED: Beth!

821
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:11,750
Turn it off.

822
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:12,910
Turn it off, you...

823
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:14,510
Turn it off, Beth!

824
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:16,070
Listen to me, Beth.

825
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:17,830
Turn it off.

826
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:19,510
You turn it off!

827
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:23,560
Turn it off.

828
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:26,150
You turn it off, Beth!

829
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:27,630
Beth?

830
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:31,630
Turn it... (MUFFLED).. off! Please.

831
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:35,680
Turn it off.

832
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:59,630
Beth?

833
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:01,510
Wait!

834
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:03,470
I'm sorry, I was pissed.

835
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:05,990
Can we just talk about this
properly, please?

836
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:09,150
I've said some really awful shit.
Beth, I love you.

837
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:11,830
Listen, we can work this out.

838
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:13,470
(MUFFLED) No, Beth...

839
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:16,510
Beth, please!

840
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:20,560
Beth!

841
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:26,310
That day, I didn't go to work.

842
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:29,230
I just stayed at home and...

843
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:31,950
.. tried to work out
how to make amends.

844
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,430
But she just didn't come back.

845
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:38,480
And thanks to the block,
I couldn't...

846
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:42,430
I couldn't message her.
I couldn't call her.

847
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:44,390
After a week, I was pretty desperate.

848
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:48,440
So I just hung around
outside her work, like a stalker.

849
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:53,630
Tim! Gita!

850
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:56,270
Have you seen Beth?

851
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:58,190
She left.

852
00:50:58,240 --> 00:50:59,470
Left. What, like...?

853
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:01,110
Handed in her notice.

854
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:05,160
No-one knows where she is.

855
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:11,950
Joe?

856
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,190
~ Joe! ~ No, leave him.

857
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:17,270
I was still hopeful
that she would get in touch,

858
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:21,230
or at least remove the block
so that I could contact her.

859
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:24,270
But no.

860
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:27,270
When there's a block,
you can't even wallow properly.

861
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:29,830
You can't switch it off.

862
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:32,630
You can't take the Zed-Eyes out.

863
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:36,680
And it doesn't just block them,
it blocks every image of them.

864
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:41,000
So every memory
I had of her was vandalised.

865
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:50,600
And then one day
I'm out in town and...

866
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:55,870
.. it was her.

867
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:59,920
She was pregnant.

868
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:05,670
She'd kept it.

869
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:07,230
Well, I just sort of lost it.

870
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:10,670
I just ran over and started
pleading with her. Just pleading.

871
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:13,230
MUFFLED VOICE

872
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:16,390
Turn it off. Turn it off.
Just turn it off.

873
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:18,830
Turn it off. Beth, turn it off.

874
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:20,790
Help. Get off me!

875
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:24,840
Some passer-by called the police.
They took me down the station.

876
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:29,480
And that was that.

877
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:33,750
So, by now, the block's
got legal backing.

878
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:36,510
And there's a GPS so that if I go
within ten metres of her,

879
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:40,560
bang - I get arrested.

880
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:43,110
Harsh.

881
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:45,950
Yeah, and I've got no idea
where she is.

882
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,790
If...
Whether she's had the baby or not.

883
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:51,310
Whether it's a boy or a girl.

884
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:54,510
If it's OK.

885
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:57,990
I've got absolutely no way
of getting in touch with her.

886
00:52:58,040 --> 00:53:01,950
Except I knew where her dad lived.

887
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:06,000
So I write her a letter,
this begging letter.

888
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:10,840
Laying it all out, you know,
and I get no response.

889
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:18,240
So I write again...

890
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:22,670
.. and again...

891
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:25,550
.. and again.

892
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:29,600
No response.

893
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:31,750
She cut you out good.

894
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:35,150
But there was one thing I could do.

895
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:38,150
I knew she spent every Christmas
with him at his place,

896
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:42,200
so I knew that she would
definitely be there.

897
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:46,600
So, the day before,
Christmas Eve, I headed up.

898
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:52,670
And where her dad lived
was this isolated place

899
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:54,510
in the back of beyond.

900
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:58,230
I'd never been up there without her.

901
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:01,990
It was weird being on the outside.

902
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:05,150
I waited there all day. Until...

903
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:09,200
CAR DOORS SLAM

904
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:24,030
Well, I had to take a closer look.

905
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:27,190
And there's her dad with our baby,

906
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:29,470
but I can't even see its face
because...

907
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:33,520
Legal blocks cover offspring too.

908
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:35,870
Been there.

909
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:39,920
That hurts.

910
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:45,480
I couldn't even tell
if it was a boy or a girl.

911
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:58,240
I know this sounds stupid...

912
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:04,310
.. but seeing something...

913
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:08,360
.. was better than nothing.

914
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:12,800
So I kept going back.

915
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:17,000
It became an annual pilgrimage.

916
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:21,240
Once a year I'd head up there
and watch them from a distance.

917
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:27,000
Watching the kid grow up, you know?

918
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:34,640
MUFFLED VOICES

919
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:42,830
More than anything I just wanted
to make some sort of contact.

920
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:44,630
Anything.

921
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:48,390
So, one Christmas, kid must have
been about four by now,

922
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:52,440
I headed up there
and I took a little present with me.

923
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:56,840
Just a small, stupid thing.

924
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:04,040
For the first time,
I could see she was a girl.

925
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:11,480
I had a daughter.

926
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,990
So, Santa Claus...

927
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:21,670
.. did you try it again next year?

928
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:24,720
Something happened before then.

929
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:30,750
'It had been a few months since

930
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:33,670
'I'd been up there
to look at my daughter.

931
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:37,720
'I was just sat at home watching TV,
flipping through the channels.'

932
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:41,950
TV: '.. which claimed the lives of 26
people on a quiet Wednesday morning.

933
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,790
'Passengers like Palab Ghatak,

934

935
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:50,480
'and Bethany Grey, a young mother
who'd only recently started...'

936
00:56:54,440 --> 00:56:57,150
It had been so long since
I'd seen her, it was hard to imagine

937
00:56:57,200 --> 00:57:00,390
anything but that shadow
in her place.

938
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:04,440
But now that the block
had died with her...

939
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:08,430
.. there she was.

940
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:11,750
She was gone.

941
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:15,750
HE SOBS

942
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:19,800
Sorry.

943
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:26,710
But there was one silver lining...

944
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:28,150
With the block gone.

945
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:32,200
You'd get to see your daughter.

946
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:39,480
'It was almost Christmas,

That she just...
she just stayed in the house.

1019
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:21,790
It was, um...

1020
01:04:21,840 --> 01:04:25,550
It was Christmas Eve, so she just...

1021

.. she just stayed hidden.
She didn't move.

1022

Then on Boxing Day she realised
that no-one was going to help.

1023
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:49,200
And she gave her grandad
a present that she'd made.

1024
01:04:56,800 --> 01:05:00,800

1041
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:44,230

and he said piss all,

1042

1043

It wasn't really 70 minutes,
not to him.

1045
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:56,390
When he was first ingested,
I tweaked the time preferences,

1046
01:06:56,440 --> 01:07:00,440
made it seam like five years
from his perspective.

1047
01:07:00,520 --> 01:07:04,520
Some might say that five years
with me is punishment enough.
