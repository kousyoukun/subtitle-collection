Hey, gorgeous, just checking that you're still on for tonight.

偏遠郊區發現兩具男尸后
A murder enquiry has been launched after the bodies of two men

18
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,430
警方開始兇案偵查
were discovered at a remote farmhouse.

19
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:45,570
受害者的身份還未確定
The victims have not been formally identified,

20
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:48,180
但其中一人是現役警察
but one is understood to be a serving police officer.

21
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:16,590
警方還未就此案做出相關批捕
Police have yet to make an arrest in connection to the case.

22
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,660
這場殘忍的雙尸案發生于
The brutal double killing took place

23
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:20,580
昨日的康普頓馬丁附近
near Compton Martin yesterday.

24
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:31,970
想必大家都不會感到意外
You won't be surprised to learn that

25
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:34,530
這個案件已成為重大事件
this has been designated a major incident.

26
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:37,710
肖恩·哈達克督察被謀殺了
DI Sean Hardacre has been murdered.

27
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:39,700
我向你們保證
And I can assure you,

28
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:43,690
正如我剛才向肖恩的遺孀海倫保證的
as I've just assured Sean's widow Helen,

29
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:47,050
此案從今起成為我的頭等大事
that this will remain my first and foremost priority

30
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:49,960
直到我們抓到他的兇手并定罪
until we catch and convict his killer.

31
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,950
我知道你們和我一樣急切想找到這個混蛋
Now, I know you're all as keen as I am to nail this bastard,

32
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,490
所以我會調派我手下
so I will be seconding officers

33
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,050
不同隊伍的警察
from all the different teams under me

34
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,860
一起偵破這起案件
to work on this investigation.

35
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,550
就這樣
That's it.

36
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,000
工作吧
Let's get to work.

37
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:07,520
謝謝  長官
Thank you, sir.

38
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,080
你們可以用我的辦公室
You can use my office, you know.

39
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:41,770
那不安全
It's not safe.

40
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:44,250
上面有人在泄露消息
Someone up there is leaking information.

41
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:46,980
那我們要怎么辦
So, what are we going to do?

42
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:48,990
整天在這里鬼鬼祟祟嗎
Skulk around here all day?

43
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:52,040
你得在我們的調查外設立防火墻
You've got to throw a firewall around our investigation.

44
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:54,100
所以這現在是調查了嗎
So, it's an investigation now, is it?

45
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:56,140
伊茜給了我們足夠的線索進行調查
Issy's given us plenty to go on.

46
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:57,640
沒錯  但我們得不讓別人知道
Yeah, but we've got to keep that close,

47
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,930
只有我們三人
just between the three of us.

48
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:00,980
沒有證據顯示她的臥底身份被識破
There's no sign that her cover's been blown.

49
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:02,630
就給我們一點時間
Look, just give us some time.

50
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,020
看她能知道什么
See what she can find out.

51
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:08,630
伊茜是我們抓住肖恩兇手的最佳機會
Issy is our best chance of catching Sean's killer.

52
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,640
這不實際
It's not realistic.

53
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:14,180
為什么  只有我們知道她的存在
Why not? We're the only ones that know about her.

54
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:15,700
或與餐廳的聯系
Or the link to the restaurant.

55
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:17,540
凱恩像紅疹一樣鋪天蓋地地查這個案子
Kane is all over this like a rash.

56
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:19,180
我得告訴他
I have to tell him.

57
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:21,080
-不行  -他是我們的老大  漢娜
- No. - He's our boss, Hannah.

58
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:21,840
他也跟別人一樣
He could just as easily

59
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,890
可能是泄露信息的內鬼
be the source of the leak as anyone else.

60
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:29,780
你想要什么
So, what are you asking?

61
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:32,600
給我們一點空中掩護
Just give us some air cover.

62
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,960
確保我們不被
Just make sure that we're not

63
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,050
調派去主要事件偵查團隊
seconded to the major incident team.

64
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:38,550
如果我們找到任何線索  我們可以決定
If we dig up anything, then we can try and work out

65
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:40,610
在什么時候告訴什么人
who it's safe to tell and when.

66
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:43,690
這違反了所有規矩
This breaks every rule in the book.

67
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:45,760
那就讓我主導調查吧
Well, then, let me take the lead on it.

68
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:49,750
如果我們被抓包  你可以說
If we get rumbled, you can say

69
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:53,090
你讓我看看肖恩正在進行的調查
you asked me to take a look at Sean's ongoing investigations.

70
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:56,390
我從肖恩的文件發現了伊茜的存在
I found out about Issy through Sean's files

71
00:03:56,390 --> 00:04:00,640
并開始利用她做我的線人
and I started running her as a confidential contact.

72
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,780
你都不知道有這么一號人
And you didn't even know that she existed.

73
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:05,610
好吧
All right.

74
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:09,660
給你們幾天  但必須時刻告訴我進展
You've got a few days, but I need to be kept updated.

75
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:13,740
我們所有人都在為此冒險
All our necks are now on the line.

00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,750
不  我得學習
No. I have to study.

85
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:17,560
只是場愚蠢的游戲
It's just a stupid game.

86
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:20,560
但是四分之一決賽了
But it's the quarterfinals.

What are we looking for?

101

大麻
Cannabis.

102
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,420

How much?

103
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:33,360
誰在乎  達沃可以自己玩蛋去了
Who cares, Davor can go fuck himself.

104
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,590
你不是那個意思
You don't mean that.

105
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,280
他一點不尊重我
He shows me no respect.

-去他媽的達沃  -來吧  斯特凡

今天有什么這么重要
So, what's so important today?

109
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:14,080
他非得讓你錯過籃球賽
That he's making you miss your basketball?

110
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,860
我們要去見安德里
We're supposed to meet Andri.

111
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:18,970
誰是安德里
Who's Andri?

112
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,210
一個阿爾巴尼亞瘋子
A crazy fucking Albanian.

113
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:27,880
安德里是我們進入卡拉布里亞的方法
Andri is our way into Calabria.

114
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:30,920
卡拉布里亞在哪
Where's Calabria?

115
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:33,250
你什么都不知道  對吧
You know nothing, do you?

116
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:34,650
那告訴我
So, teach me.

117
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:38,050
英格蘭半數的可卡因都從卡拉布里亞進口
Half the cocaine in England comes through Calabria.

118
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:39,820
好吧
Ok.

119
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,480
現在我懂了
Now I get it.

120
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:45,630
所以我們通過阿爾巴尼亞人進入卡拉布里亞
So, we go through Albania to get to Calabria

121
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:48,660
通過卡拉布里亞實現克拉伊納
and we go through Calabria to get to Krajina.

122
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,190
克拉伊納是什么
And what's Krajina?

123
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:55,490
與你無關
None of your fucking business.

124
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:04,850
克拉伊納是我們的過去
Krajina is our past.

125
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:07,640
也是我們的未來
And it's also our future.

126
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:09,970
我不明白
I don't understand.

127
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:13,090
你怎么會懂  你不是克羅地亞人
How could you, you're not Croatian.

128
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,100
我是混血
I'm half.

129
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:19,280
別擔心了
Don't worry about it.

130
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:23,480
只是達沃的愚蠢計劃
It's just some bullshit plan of Davor's.

131
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,550
他現在認為自己是大佬了
He thinks he's Mr Big Bollocks now.

132
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:28,290
說我們要掌管西南毒品交易的
Claims we're going to take over half the drug trade

133
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:30,430
半壁江山什么的
in south west or something.

134
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:33,140
什么  阿爾巴尼亞人會坐著讓給我們嗎
What? And the Albanians will just stand back and let us?

135
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,490
他說他們別無選擇
He says they won't have a choice.

136
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:41,020
來吧  我們離開這里
Come on, let's get out of here.

137
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:42,500
我們不能就這么走了
We can't just go.

138
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:44,830
他可以干自己的臟活
He can do his own dirty work.

139
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:00,790
{\an8}克拉伊納是個巨大的

140
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:01,700
{\an8}巨大的販賣可卡因行動

141
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:02,830
{\an8}可能去見

142
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:04,520
{\an8}可能去見安德里這人

143
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,920
{\an8}今天

144
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:19,570
這里有多少
And how much is there?

145
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:21,950
大概五公斤
Maybe five kilos.

146
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:24,270
你得殺了魚才拿到嗎
And you had to gut the fish to get it?

147
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:28,370
并沒有殺魚  只是檢查每條魚體內
Well, not gut them exactly, just check inside each one.

148
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,440
有多少魚
And how many boxes of fish?

149
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:32,800
天知道
God knows.

150
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:34,630
很多
A lot.

151
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:39,870
我告訴你  克里斯申  有三百盒
I will tell you, Christian, there were 300 boxes.

152
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:42,930
然而斯特凡卻一整個下午都在外面喝酒
And yet Stefan was out drinking all afternoon.

153
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:47,380
我很榮幸跟一個正直的人做生意
You know, it is a pleasure to deal with someone with integrity.

154
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:54,640
這表達了我的感謝
This is a token of my appreciation.

155
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:03,920
謝謝
Thank you.

156
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,570
你現在跟我們混了
You're working with us now.

157
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,140
這是什么地方
What is this place?

158
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:43,630
是個安全屋
It's a safe house.

159
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:45,740
我不知道我們還用這些
Didn't know we still used those.

160
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:48,100
我們不用  是我用
We don't. I do.

161
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:22,230
{\an8}一小時后見面

162
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:23,560
{\an8}保齡

163
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,910
{\an8}保齡球館

164
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:25,950
{\an8}斯皮德韋爾

165
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:27,700
這是什么
What the hell is it?

166
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:30,950
前南斯拉夫的內戰中所犯的暴行
It's one of the few remaining photos of an atrocity that was

167
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:33,510
這是為數不多所剩余的照片
committed during the Civil War in the former Yugoslavia.

168
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,880
這告訴了我們
And it tells us everything

169
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,930
關于米密查一家我們需要知道的一切
that we need to know about the Mimicas.

170
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:38,770
經營那個餐廳的家族嗎
The family that run the restaurant?

171
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:40,910
他們在一個下午失去了
They lost more than 20 relatives and

172
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:42,440
20多個親戚和鄰居
neighbours in a single afternoon.

173
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:46,630
俘虜他們村莊的塞爾維亞人不分青紅皂白
The Serbs that captured their village were pretty indiscriminate.

174
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,190
你就要看到幸存者了
You're about to see the survivors.

175
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,360
這是杜布拉芙卡
So, this is Dubravka.

176
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,850
據我們所知  她是大家族的女族長
She's a bit of a clan matriarch, as far as we can tell.

177
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:58,590
這是她的妹夫  茲沃諾密爾
And this is her brother-in-law, Zvonomir.

178
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:01,420
他是我唯一之前交過手的人
He's the only one I've come across before.

179
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:02,900
我們有他的卷宗嗎
Do we have a file on him?

180
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:03,940
沒有
No.

181
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,460
他的名字出現在不久前的緝毒行動中
His name was linked to a drugs bust a while back.

182
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:10,260
局里讓我去進行審訊
The agency asked me to sit in on the interview

183
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:12,030
因為我在東歐的聯系
cos of the Eastern European connection,

184
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:14,490
但他沒被起訴
but he wasn't charged.

185
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:19,020
這是杜布拉芙卡的女兒  碧昂卡
This is Dubravka's daughter, Bianca.

186
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:21,660
她是伊茜嗎
Is she Issy?

187
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:24,200
說實話  我們不知道
The honest answer is, we don't know.

188
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:27,910
跟她牽手的人是誰
And whose hand is she holding?

189
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:29,500
斯特凡·瓦蓋奇
Stefan Vargic.

190
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:32,680
這是唯一一個我們手里有資料的人
The only one we have anything concrete on.

191
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,230
是什么
And what's that?

192
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:35,930
他做了18個月牢
He served 18 months...

193
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:37,930
蓄意持毒
For possession with intent.

194
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:43,020
這位杰出的男士是
And here's the illustrious man himself...

195
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:47,110
達沃·米密查  兒子和繼承人
..Davor Mimica, son and heir.

196
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:48,880
那是他男友嗎
Is that his boyfriend?

197
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:51,130
可能
Possibly.

198
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:53,080
家里其他人知道嗎
Do the rest of them know?

199
00:13:56,090 --> 00:13:57,690
這些照片都是肖恩拍的嗎
And these are all taken by Sean?

200
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:59,490
他在拼湊事件前后
He was putting the pieces together.

201
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,310
肯定有人給他們通風報信了
Someone must have tipped them off.

202
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:06,240
{\an8}發送

203
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:12,980
你在電話里說有新消息
You said on the phone that you had fresh information.

204
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:13,670
對
Aye.

205
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:15,940
伊茜給了新信息
Issy's come good.

206
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:17,570
說稍后會有一個會議
There's a meeting later on.

207
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,510
和這個人
With this guy.

208
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,810
安德里·卡巴夏
Andri Kabashi.

209
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:25,370
屬于阿爾巴尼亞黑幫  他們控制著南格洛斯特郡
Belongs to an Albanian gang that controls the coke trade

210
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:27,060
部分地區的可卡因販賣
in parts of South Gloucestershire.

211
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:29,980
這么說米密查打算擴張
So the Mimicas are looking to expand.

212
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:31,660
看來是如此
Seems that way.

213
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:35,540
-好  我得走了  -我也是
- All right, I've got to be going. - Yeah, me too.

214
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:41,550
比利  我需要拿回筆記本
Billy, I need that laptop back.

215
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:43,480
誰要
Who's asking for it?

216
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,350
芙蘭  但他們都提到了
Fran, but they've all mentioned it.

217
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,840
你能再給我幾天嗎
Well, can you give me a couple of days?

218
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:49,810
好
Ok.

219
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:59,550
{\an8}你能錄音嗎

220
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:09,230
走吧
Let's go.

221
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:18,750
{\an8}太危險了

222
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:51,110
達沃在哪
Where is Davor?

223
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:52,420
我替達沃說話
I speak for Davor.

224
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:55,160
聽著
Look...

225
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:58,730
我們只想讓你牽線搭橋
..All we're asking you is to make the connection.

226
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:02,090
如果你只有這個要求
If that's all you're asking...

227
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:04,420
那你自己牽線搭橋
..Then make it yourself.

228
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:06,300
但我們答應給你一大筆錢
But we are offering you a shitload.

229
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,790
我們給你25%的利潤
We give you 25% of the profit.

230
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:11,740
這是很大的讓步了
It's a big step up.

231
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,860
你為什么這么犯渾
Why are you being an asshole, huh?

232
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:16,850
那么
So...

233
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:19,850
我是個混蛋  是嗎
..I'm being an asshole, am I?

234
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:21,810
他不是這個意思  安德里
He doesn't mean that, Andri.

235
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:23,470
我們想成為朋友
We want to be friends.

236
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,230
對
Yeah...

不是敵人

00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:51,110
"我是克里斯申  請留言"
"This is Christian. Say something."

252
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,990
克里斯申  你能給我回電嗎
Christian, will you call me, please?

253
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:56,240
好  慢點
OK, slow down.

254
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:59,100
沒人跟著我們  他們不是來抓我們的
There's no-one following. It's not us they're after.

255
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:01,350
我說了  慢點開
I said, take it easy!

256
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:03,630
媽的
Fuck!

257

他準備好交易了  一切都好
He's ready to deal. It's good!

259
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:16,200
"我是克里斯申  請留言"

來個人幫忙  趕緊
Can I have some help here, people?!

266
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:02,760
別說話  呼吸
Don't speak, just breathe--

267
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:05,770
給她點空間  給她點空氣
Give her some room, give her some air!

268
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,760
{\an2}{\pos(192,240)}怎么回事

269
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,440
{\an2}{\pos(192,240)}警察來了

270

{\an2}{\pos(192,240)}有人給他們消息了嗎

{\an2}{\pos(192,240)}別擔心

273
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,600
{\an2}{\pos(192,240)}肯定只是巧合

274
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,600
{\an2}{\pos(192,240)}安德里一點也不小心

275
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,680
{\an2}{\pos(192,240)}你覺得我們會有問題嗎

276
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,240
{\an2}{\pos(192,240)}如果有  我們會知道

277
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:42,270
{\an8}漢娜  三個未接來電

278
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:04,530
這怎么可能
How is this even possible?

279
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,650
我查了
I checked.

280
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:10,140
克里斯申和斯特凡·瓦蓋奇是獄友
Christian and Stefan Vargic were cell mates.

281
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:13,020

What about Sean?

282
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:15,060
他和克里斯申關系很好
He and Christian were close.

283
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:17,310
我聽漢娜說起過
I've heard Hannah talk about it.

284
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,050
他沒想過要告訴她嗎
And he didn't think to tell her?

285
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:22,520
我想他打算說的
I think he was going to, you know,

286
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:25,870
在她問了關于伊茜的事之后  但是
after she questioned him about Issy, but...

287
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,390
但他還沒來及說就死了
..But he never got the chance.

288
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:33,420
還有她去那干什么
What the hell was she even doing there?

289
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,330
她覺得自己能干什么
What did she think she could achieve?

290
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:38,220
我以為那是個年輕姑娘
Well, I was dealing with a young woman.

291
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:41,130
我擔心她
I was worried for her.

292
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:46,380
萬一她有什么麻煩  我可以去救她
I wanted to be there in case she got into trouble.

293
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,950
別對自己太嚴格了
Don't be too hard on yourself.

294
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:52,290
我
I've...

295
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:53,760
我讓他陷入了危險
..I've put him in danger.

296
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:56,510
這是他自找的
He brought that on himself.

297
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:58,730
我要叫停行動了
I'm going to pull the plug.

298
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:02,730
你能聯系他嗎  讓他退出
Can you contact him? Tell him he needs to get out.

299
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,400
這話還是由他媽媽說比較妥當吧
Wouldn't that be better coming from his mum?

300
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:09,120
漢娜根本不能辦這個案子
Hannah should be nowhere near this.

301
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,640
事情太復雜了
It's way too messy.

302
00:22:11,810 --> 00:22:14,040
他不接我的電話
He's not answering my calls.

303
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,500
接著打
Keep trying.

304
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:26,490
這個太咸了嗎
Is this too salty?

305
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:27,700
這是什么
What is it?

306
00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:29,450
帕斯蒂卡達燉牛肉
Pasticada.

307
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,390
很好吃
Oh, it's good.

308
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,210
-你個騙子  -抱歉
- You liar! - Oh! Sorry!

309
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:42,270
-真抱歉  你還好嗎  -嗯
- I'm so sorry! Are you OK? - Yeah.

310
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:44,720
不  給我看看  好紅
No, let me see! No, it's really red!

311
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:50,820
壞主意
Bad idea.

312
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,020
你有兩個手機嗎
You have two phones?

313
00:22:58,670 --> 00:22:59,730
怎么了
What's going on?

314
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:01,280
我只是...
Oh, I was just, er...

315
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:02,720
手機掉了
..Dropped my phone.

316
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,610
有什么吃的嗎
Anything to eat?

317
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:09,460
帕斯蒂卡達燉牛肉
Ah, pasticada.

318
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,830
你能送一盤上來嗎
Can you send up a plate?

319
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:26,970
謝謝
Thanks.

320
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:48,720
我們都以為你只是
Oh! We were beginning to think you were

321
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,570
他想象中的人物了
a figment of his imagination.

322
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,480
你們約會多久了
How long have you been dating?

323
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:56,310
約會  不  天吶
Dating? No. Oh, my God!

324
00:23:56,850 --> 00:23:59,030
這是我們約炮以后第三次見面
This is the third time I've seen him since we hooked up.

325
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:02,350
好好享受

326
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:07,710
-他們喜歡你  放松  -我很放松

327
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:12,030
你想要什么
Do you want anything?

328
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:15,430
-你賣什么  -K粉  每包一百

329

00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:20,860

給你  七十塊  給我滾
Here, 70 quid. Now get lost.

335
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,060
別這樣
Oh, come on...

336
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,430
玩會兒

干杯
Cheers.

339
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:15,680
你不用告訴我任何事
'You don't need to tell me anything.'

340
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:18,490
或許我該告訴你
'Maybe I do, actually.'

341
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:48,560

等等  叫達沃過來

我給他打了幾次電話  沒人接
I've tried him a few times. There's no answer.

355
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:55,930
或許他在開會
Maybe he's stuck in meetings.

356
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:57,220
誰是最后看到他的人
Who saw him last?

357

他穿戴整齊準備出門

但你不是家人
But you're not family.

365
00:28:12,910 --> 00:28:14,160
或許這樣更好
Well, maybe that's for the best.

366

00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:32,860
沒加糖
No sugar.

426
00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:39,980
沒消息嗎
No word?

427
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:42,890
別擔心  他會聯系你的
Don't worry. He'll call.

428
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:44,210
我不那么確定
I wouldn't be so sure.

429
00:36:44,210 --> 00:36:46,890
我不是克里斯申圣誕節賀卡上的頭號人物
I'm not exactly top of his Christmas card list.

430
00:36:48,350 --> 00:36:50,660
他只需要時間消化這一切
He just needs time to process it.

431
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:54,130
決定他是否要繼續
Decide if he wants to continue.

432
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:56,440
他不能繼續了
There's no way he's continuing.

433
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,620
我想那由不得你
I'm not sure that's up to you.

434
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:00,840
我是他母親
I'm his mother.

435
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:03,390
對  但他是成年人
Aye, and he's a grown-up.

436
00:37:08,970 --> 00:37:10,510
你聽到蒂娜說的了
You heard what Tina said.

437
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:14,170
如果她告訴凱恩  那整個團隊都知道了
If she tells Kane then the whole of HQ might as well know,

438
00:37:14,170 --> 00:37:17,510
然后米密查家族的內鬼會...
and then whoever's leaking information to the Mimicas will...

439
00:37:19,890 --> 00:37:22,540
他如果留下就是自殺
It'd be suicide for him to stay.

440
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:27,020
我來找你是為了提個其他建議
I'm meeting you to suggest an alternative.

441
00:37:28,590 --> 00:37:30,280
讓蒂娜改變心意
Make Tina change her mind.

442
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:37,670
不如讓克里斯申做我的線人
Why don't I take over Christian as my contact?

443
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:39,940
你嗎
You?

444
00:37:40,450 --> 00:37:41,770
我有更多回旋余地
I've way more leeway.

445
00:37:43,310 --> 00:37:45,880
如果真的被人發現  我就說
If it ever came to light, I'd just say

446
00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:48,700
我沒告訴你們倆他的身份
I kept his identity secret from both of you,

447
00:37:49,930 --> 00:37:51,750
我不知道你們之間的關系
that I was unaware of the connection.

448
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,330
所以我不能參與嗎
So I wouldn't be involved?

449
00:37:55,330 --> 00:37:56,780
你要參與
Oh, you'd be involved.

450
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,050
只是不是明面上
Just not officially.

451
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:02,920
如果他現在退出
If he pulls out now,

452
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,930
我們或許永遠抓不到肖恩的兇手了
we may never nail Sean's killer.

453
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:14,830
他是我兒子  比利
He's my son, Billy.

454
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:18,760
所以不要這一套"別問"的說辭
So none of this "Don't ask" Bollocks.

455
00:38:18,770 --> 00:38:22,370
你要把發生的一切都告訴我
You keep me in the loop about fucking everything.

456
00:38:57,980 --> 00:38:58,670
碧昂卡
Bianca?

457
00:39:00,290 --> 00:39:01,320
碧昂卡  你在哪
Bianca, where are you?

458
00:39:08,170 --> 00:39:09,050
我們得走了
We have to go.

459
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:36,320
{\an8}克里斯申

460
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,640
{\an8}準備好談談了

461
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:39,840
我早告訴你了
Told you so.

462
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:26,450
為什么選這里
Why here?

463
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:32,440
這里安全
It's safe.

464
00:40:44,350 --> 00:40:45,230
我想他
I miss him.

465
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:46,750
我也是
Me too.

466
00:40:48,810 --> 00:40:50,980
但如果他還沒死  我會因為
But if he wasn't already dead I'd bloody kill him

467
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:52,810
他把你卷入這一切而殺了他
for getting you involved in all this.

468
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:54,290
這是我的主意
It was my idea.

469
00:40:54,290 --> 00:40:55,350
他應該阻止你
He should've stopped you.

470
00:40:55,350 --> 00:40:56,310
他試過了
Yeah, he tried.

471
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:57,950
好吧  現在輪到我了
OK, so now it's my turn.

472
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:00,360
他們殺了他  克里斯申
They murdered him, Christian.

473
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,930
對  所以我們繼續調查
Yeah, and that's why we have to do this.

474
00:41:01,930 --> 00:41:04,080
聽著  你需要知道一些事
Listen, you need to know something.

475
00:41:04,350 --> 00:41:05,740
總部有個內鬼
There's a leak at headquarters.

476
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:08,170
米密查家族在警局安插了眼線
The Mimicas have got someone on the inside.

477
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:11,070
所以他們知道我了嗎
So they're onto me?

478
00:41:11,870 --> 00:41:13,760
我想沒有
I-I don't think so.

479
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:14,790
你怎么能確定
Well, how can you be sure?

480
00:41:14,790 --> 00:41:15,760
我不能
I can't.

481
00:41:15,770 --> 00:41:18,030
但除了我  只有兩人知道你的存在
But there's only two other people who know about you.

482
00:41:19,130 --> 00:41:20,070
你相信他們嗎
Do you trust them?

483
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:22,310
我最信任別人也就那樣了
As much as I can trust anyone.

484
00:41:23,130 --> 00:41:24,350
其中一人是我的老板
One of them's my boss.

485
00:41:24,350 --> 00:41:25,830
她想讓你退出
She wants to pull you out.

486
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:31,520
你不能說服她改變心意嗎
You can't persuade her not to?

487
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:34,360
我可以試試
I can try.

488
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:39,540
我要開車送達沃參加會議
I'm driving Davor to a meeting.

489
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:41,860
我看看是否有新消息
I'll see if anything comes of it

490
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:43,010
能幫助你改變心意
that might help change your mind.

491
00:41:47,590 --> 00:41:48,720
這是錄音器
It's a recording device.

492
00:41:50,690 --> 00:41:51,950
別你也來這套
Not you as well.

493
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:55,510
網上有五星好評
Had five-star reviews online.

494
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:13,180
你看著很像樣
You look the part.

495
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:17,180
來吧  我們走
Come on, let's go.

496
00:42:50,590 --> 00:42:51,440
開始了
Here we go.

497
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:54,480
那是安德里·卡巴夏
That's Andri Kabashi.

498
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:55,950
另外一個人是誰
Who's the other guy?

499
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:58,030
我不知道
I don't know.

500
00:43:12,050 --> 00:43:13,690
那是達沃·米密查
There's Davor Mimica.

501
00:43:22,110 --> 00:43:22,930
你留在這
You stay here.

502
00:43:43,250 --> 00:43:44,020
喂
Hello?

503
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:45,560
他沒拿
He didn't take it.

504
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:46,820
什么
What?

505
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:48,190
我該怎么辦
What do I do?

506
00:43:50,090 --> 00:43:50,940
你去搞定
You fix it.

507
00:44:10,610 --> 00:44:13,850
150公斤  這可是大量的可卡因
150kg - that's a lot of cocaine.

508
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:15,360
我們能搞定
We can handle it.

509
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,780
你會讓市場泛濫
You'll flood the market.

510
00:44:18,110 --> 00:44:20,630
沒錯  并用低價逼退
Exactly, and price a lot of other people

511
00:44:20,630 --> 00:44:21,930
其他的競爭對手
out of it in the process.

512
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:25,310
你這樣要樹敵
You're going to make enemies.

513
00:44:25,850 --> 00:44:28,540
我干這行不是為了交朋友
I didn't get into this business to win friends.

514
00:44:29,690 --> 00:44:31,230
而且這不是一次性交易嗎
And it isn't just a one-off?

515
00:44:31,450 --> 00:44:32,610
這只是個開始
It's just a start.

516
00:44:32,870 --> 00:44:35,540
這對我們雙方都會利潤豐厚
This is going to be very profitable for both of us.

517
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:40,570
150公斤
150 kilos?

518
00:44:41,890 --> 00:44:44,500
他們要怎么出手這么多毒品
How in the name of God will they swing that?

519
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:45,900
我不知道
I've no idea.

520
00:44:47,970 --> 00:44:49,510
這是個大證據  克里斯申
This is a hell of a lead, Christian.

521
00:44:50,610 --> 00:44:51,810
現在留給我們吧
You can leave it with us now.

522
00:44:52,530 --> 00:44:53,130
不
No.

523
00:44:53,970 --> 00:44:54,800
不  我是認真的
No, I mean it.

524
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:57,860
你沒必要再深入虎穴了
There's no need to put yourself in any more danger.

525
00:44:57,860 --> 00:44:59,770
但你們還是不知道他們要怎么操作
But you still don't know how they're gonna do this.

526
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:02,040
沒有我  你們永遠都不會知道
And without me you never will.

527
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:04,010
你不用證明什么
You've got nothing to prove.

528
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:05,570
給你的老板吧
Just give it to your boss.

529
00:45:06,270 --> 00:45:07,650
告訴她還有更多
Tell her there's plenty more to come.

530
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:09,910
我跟你出去
I'll walk with you.

531
00:45:11,370 --> 00:45:14,670
所以今后你就過來這邊  你保證嗎
So you'll come and go from here from now on, you promise me?

532
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:15,560
嗯  沒事
Yeah, it's fine.

533
00:45:15,740 --> 00:45:17,230
比利是你的聯絡人
Billy will be your contact.

534
00:45:17,230 --> 00:45:19,180
我參與此案會損害
My involvement would compromise

535
00:45:19,180 --> 00:45:20,920
你提供的所有證據
any evidence you supply us with.

536
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:21,810
我明白
I understand.

537
00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:23,060
但我會在這
But I'll be here.

538
00:45:23,550 --> 00:45:26,530
還有  你能想個掩飾身份的說辭嗎
And, please, will you try and get some kind of cover story

539
00:45:26,530 --> 00:45:28,200
萬一有人看到你進出這里
in case someone spots you coming in and out?

540
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:29,480
我很小心
I'm being careful.

541
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:31,180
還有  克里斯申
And... And, Christian?

542
00:45:33,950 --> 00:45:34,900
我是認真的
I mean it.

543
00:45:35,870 --> 00:45:37,850
你不用證明什么
You've got nothing to prove.
