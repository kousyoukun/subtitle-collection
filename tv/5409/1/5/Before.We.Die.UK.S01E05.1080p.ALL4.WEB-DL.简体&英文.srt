你能来这里吗
Should you even be here?

23
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,350
我依然是你母亲
I'm still your mother.

24
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,300
你不该去工作吗
Shouldn't you be at work?

25
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:29,870
-克里斯申  -我请病假了
- Christian? - I called in sick.

26
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:31,650
你病了吗
And are you?

27
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,570
我睡不着
I can't sleep.

28
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,950
那场景一直在我脑海里重复
It's playing in my head on a loop.

29
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:43,760
一直...挥之不去
It's just...there.

30
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:46,220
循环不停
All the time.

31
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,330
我永远都无法摆脱这噩梦了
I'll never be able to get away from it.

32
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:51,270
你会的
You will.

33
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,740
你会的  你会的
You will, you will.

34
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:55,150
你...
You've...

35
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,550
你只需要多给点时间
You've just got to give it time.

36
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:59,390
我觉得我撑不下去了
I don't think I can handle it.

37
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,840
我不该承受这些
You shouldn't have to.

38
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:12,380
这一切  都不怪你
All this, you're not to blame.

39
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:14,420
这是我的烂摊子  不是你的
This is my fuck-up, not yours.

40
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:16,610
我...
I've...

41
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:20,010
我犯了好多错
I've made so many mistakes.

42
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:22,050
对你爸爸
With your dad,

肖恩
Sean.

45
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:30,910
我们都不对彼此说真话
None of us ever really speaking the truth to one another.

46
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:33,120
我很抱歉要由你
And I'm so fucking sorry because you're the one

47
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,710
来承担后果
that's paid the price.

48
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:40,000
但除了杀死斯特凡外还有什么选择
But what was the alternative to killing Stefan?

49
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,560
你自己死吗
Your own death?

50
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:48,500
你选择了生存
You are hard wired to survive,

51
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:50,120
你也活了下来
and you did.

52
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:53,830
杀死斯特凡是正确的事
Killing Stefan was the right thing to do.

53
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:58,160
我知道你为此付出了很大代价
Now, I know that it's come at a terrible cost.

54
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,950
但那个代价会让你成为
But that cost will make you

55
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:05,960
一个坚强智慧的男人
a strong and a wise man.

56
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:19,880
你会挺过去
You will get through this.

57
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:31,260
你从哪拿到这个的
Where did you get this?

58
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:35,440
肖恩在我坐牢时给我的
Sean gave it to me when I was in prison.

59
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:39,940
他说这能保护我安全
He said it was to keep me safe.

60
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:43,840
应该给你
You should take it.

61
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:45,440
不  不要
No, no way.

62
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:47,430
给我戴太不精致了
That's got a bit of work to do yet.

63
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:56,250
是时候做决定了
It's time to decide.

64
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:58,570
你干还是不干
Are you in or are you out?

65
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:00,070
着什么急
What's the rush?

66
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,160
克拉伊纳已经开始了
Krajina has started.

67
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,300
船定好出发日期了
The ship has set sail?

68
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:06,600
几小时前离开了安特卫普
It left Antwerp a couple of hours ago,

69
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:09,550
船上装了特殊的货物
with a very special cargo on board.

70
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,620
那你需要我们干什么
So what do you need from us?

71
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:13,860
一个简单的答案
A simple answer.

72
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:17,030
我们要做朋友  一起赚大钱
Are we going to be friends and make money together...

73
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:19,970
还是做敌人  摧毁彼此
..Or enemies, tear each other apart?

74
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:24,450
我不会再问第二次
I won't ask again.

75
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:25,380
我们加入
We're in.

76
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:27,460
为此敬一杯吧
And let's drink to that.

77
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:28,770
克里斯申
Christian?

78
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:50,780

Bianca...

79
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,220
碧昂卡  拜托  你为什么不接电话
Bianca, please, why won't you answer my calls?

80
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:58,130
别烦我
Leave me alone.

81
00:06:58,540 --> 00:06:59,880
-什么  -别烦我
- What? - Leave me alone.

82
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:02,350
我们为什么不能谈谈
Why can't we just talk?

83
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:03,810
我不想跟你说话
I don't want to speak with you.

84
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:08,260
你说过不会放弃我
You said you wouldn't give up on me.

85
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,930
-碧昂卡  -离我远点  克里斯申
- Bianca... - Stay away from me, Christian.

86
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:18,270
我知道你干了什么
I know what you did.

87
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:51,520
这太令人厌烦了
This is getting tiresome.

88
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:52,670
对我们都是
For all of us.

89
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:03,230
再说一次  我郑重申明  你没有任何证据
Once again, for the record, you have no evidence to

90
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:05,890
显示我的当事人与找回的武器有关
link my client to the weapon that was recovered.

91
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,780
除了枪是在他车库里找到的
Except that it was found in his garage.

92
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,270
卡巴夏先生坚称你们不会
Mr Kabashi is adamant you won't

93
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,520
在武器上找到他的DNA
find any of his DNA on the weapon.

94
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,020
你肯定知道我们是来真的  安德里
You must know the game's up, Andri.

95
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,390
还是说你太蠢意识不到这点
Or are you too dumb to realise it?

96
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,920
我们了解你的一切
We know everything about you.

97
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:35,540
我们知道你的帮派
We know who you associate with,

我们知道你的藏匿屋
We know where you keep your stash.

100
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:48,810
我们知道莉安的一切
We know all about Leanne

101
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:51,830
她在你的行动里扮演什么角色

Florian's very young to be taken into care.

103
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:07,180
我再问一次
For the record,

104
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:10,710
你杀了肖恩·哈达克吗
did you shoot Sean Hardacre?

问询结束  11点45分

106
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,700
我快好了
I'm nearly finished.

107
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:51,650
不着急
No rush.

108
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:56,300
好奇怪
That's weird.

109
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:57,860
什么
What's that?

110
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,030
那个女人
That woman.

111

她吗
Her?

112
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:03,540
她是谁

斯特凡·瓦盖奇的已知同伙

114
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:08,470
谁
Who?

115
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,760
树林里的那个男尸
The guy found up in the woods.

116
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:13,810
真的吗  你确定吗
Really? Are you sure?

117
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:14,880
很确定
Pretty sure.

118
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:16,720
为什么这么问
Why do you ask?

119
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:18,820
她上周来过警局
She came to the station last week.

120
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:21,640
说她担心自己失踪的男友
Said she was worried about her missing boyfriend.

121
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,710
我们让她做了部分身份信息验证
We got her to do a partial ID.

122
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:26,570
斯特凡·瓦盖奇吗
Stefan Vargic?

123
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:28,450
她发誓不是他
She swore blind it wasn't him.

124
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:37,940
碧昂卡
Bianca?

125
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:38,580
怎么了
Yeah?

126
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:41,150
我是芙兰·希利  你有空吗
Fran Healy. Do you have a moment?

127
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:42,400
抱歉
I'm sorry.

128
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,490
我只想谈谈
I just wanna talk.

129
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,880
我知道是你帮助我们确认了斯特凡
I know it was you who helped us to identify Stefan.

130
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:52,640
那肯定需要很大的勇气
That must have taken a lot of nerve.

131
00:11:57,010 --> 00:11:58,290
他死了
The fact that he's dead...

132
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,170
让人感觉不真实
..It's just so surreal.

133
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:06,240
你为什么坦白
Why did you come forward?

134
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,190
我只想让这停下
I just want it to stop.

135
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:12,220
你想让谁停下
You want who to stop?

136
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:15,020
你的家人吗
Your family?

137
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:18,110
-你是说他们杀了...  -我什么也没说
- Are you saying they killed... - I'm not saying anything.

138
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:24,800
你知道任何关于肖恩·哈达克谋杀案的事吗
Do you know anything about the murder of Sean Hardacre?

139
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:26,310
我得走了
I have to go.

140
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:28,240
我能帮你  碧昂卡
I can help you, Bianca.

141

让一切停下
To make it stop...

142
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:07,520
克里斯申
Christian?

143
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,380
克里斯
Chrissy?

144
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:13,100
我给你买了咖喱  你就不用做饭了
I brought you a curry so that you don't need to cook.

145
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:17,690
克里斯申
Christian?

146
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:25,420
克里斯申  天呐  醒醒  醒醒
Christian, come on, wake up, wake up.

147
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:29,400
好吧
Ok...

148
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:46,510
紧急情况  你需要什么服务
Emergency. What service do you require?

149
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:48,840
救护车
Ambulance, please.

150
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:50,220
地址是哪里
What's the address?

151
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:54,100
斯托克斯克罗夫特  格洛斯特法院14B
It's 14B, Gloucester Court, Stokes Croft.

152
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,300
你来电的原因是什么
What's the reason for your call?

153
00:13:57,090 --> 00:13:59,380
我儿子  他昏迷了
Yes, it's my son. He's unconscious.

154
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,110
我觉得他
I-I think he's, ah...

155
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:04,600
我觉得他吃了药  喝了酒
I think he's taken some pills and, erm, alcohol.

156
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,700
但我不知道是什么  和服用的剂量
I don't know what and I don't know how much.

157
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:08,300
他多大了
How old is he?

158
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:09,850
24岁
He's 24.

159
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:11,230
他有呼吸吗
Is he breathing?

160
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,250
对  他有呼吸
Yes, he's breathing.

161
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:14,560
我检查了他的呼吸道  他还有呼吸
I checked his airways and he's breathing.

162
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:16,820
请保持冷静  救护车马上到
Please stay calm. An ambulance is on its way.

163
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:19,580
克里斯申  挺住
Christian, come on...

164
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:05,260
他怎么样了
How is he?

165
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:08,460
醒了  但很虚弱
Awake but very weak.

166
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:11,290
他说什么了吗
Has he said anything?

167
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:13,760
他说是个意外
He claims it was an accident.

168
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:15,310
医生似乎相信他
The doctors seem to believe him

169
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:17,820
但他们给他提供了心理咨询  以防万一
but they offered him counselling just in case.

170
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:20,440
我暂时相信他吧
Well, I'll give him the benefit of the doubt.

171
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:23,130
他还活着  这最重要
He's alive, that's the main thing.

172
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,740
船已经离港了
The ship's left port.

173
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:29,580
什么时候到港
When will it dock?

174
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:33,450
后天  如果是往布里斯托开的话
Day after tomorrow, assuming it's heading for Bristol,

175
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:35,230
但我们不能确定
although we can't be sure of anything.

176
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:36,930
没有克里斯申的话
Without Christian.

177
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,830
我本来打算说没有更多情报的话
I was going to say without further intelligence

178
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:41,600
但其实是一回事
but it amounts to the same thing.

179
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,440
我得回他身边了
I'd better get back to him.

180
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,100
好
Ok.

181
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:48,080
你保重
You take care.

182
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:57,190
{\an9}碧昂卡
碧昂卡  拜托
你为什么不接电话
我不知道你觉得自己知道什么  我们能谈谈吗
碧昂卡  见鬼
求你了
我快疯了
接电话吧
你说过不会放弃我
拜托  碧昂卡

183
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,680
我们再也不交谈了
We never talk any more.

184
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,540
-我们一直谈话啊  -但不谈心了
- We talk all the time. - Not properly.

185
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:39,680
跟我说说  怎么了
Speak to me. What's wrong?

186
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:42,390
你在想斯特凡吗
Are you thinking about Stefan?

187
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:45,700
你不必担心
You mustn't worry.

188
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:50,420
我们昨晚接到了他的电话  他没事
We heard from him last night. He's doing fine.

189
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,920
至于你
And as for you...

190
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:02,280
这个嘛
..Well...

191
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,040
男人们很快会排着长队
..They're going to be queuing up

192
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,760
等着跟你约会  我美丽的女儿
to date you, my beautiful baby girl.

193
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:11,020
好了
Now...

194
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:14,760
开心点  宝贝
..Be happy, duso.

195
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:20,190
我们不能让你在我的生日会上
We can't have you making everyone

196
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:22,290
把大家惹得不开心
miserable at my birthday party.

197
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:41,690
克拉伊纳
Krajina.

198
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:46,890
来啊
Come on!

199
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:49,270
现身吧
Show yourselves!

200
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,100
你这懦夫
You fucking cowards!

201
00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:00,300
我觉得不用把这个放回去了
Hardly seems worth putting back.

202
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:03,580
真神奇  竟然在这么小的玻璃里
It's amazing how much they can put away

203
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:05,570
放了这么多液体
in these tiny little glasses.

204
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,410
你在干什么
What on earth are you doing?!

205
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,240
我自己出院了
I've discharged myself.

206
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,350
你说真的吗
You can't be serious?

207
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:50,000
我要去找人谈谈
I'm going to go and speak to someone.

208
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:50,850
你在浪费时间
You're wasting your time.

209
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:52,300
他们做什么都不能阻止我
There's nothing they can do to stop me.

210
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,790
克里斯申  你就不能
Christian, can't you at least talk

211
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:55,850
-跟那里的人谈谈吗  -说什么
- to someone in there? - And say what?

212
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:57,720
我该告诉他们什么
What am I going to tell them?

213
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:00,570
别担心我了  我没事
Just stop worrying about me. I'm fine.

214
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,350
我得回去了
I have to get back.

215
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:05,500
-我不会让你回去  -妈  住手
- I'm not going to let you. - Mum, stop it!

216
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:08,430
我得结束这一切
I have to finish this.

217
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,830
对  我想从现在起
Yes, I can assure you you won't need

218
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:35,830
你不需要找别人了
to go to anyone else from now on.

219
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,720
好  听着  我们晚点说  好吗  拜
OK, listen, erm, we'll talk later, OK? Bye.

220
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:42,230
怎么了
What happened?

221
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:44,540
他们认为我癫痫发作了
They think I had a seizure.

222
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:46,200
-什么  -很轻微
- What? - It was a minor one.

223
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:49,020
-我现在没事了  -你之前有过吗
- I'm fine now. - Have you had it before?

224
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:53,530
是怎么引起的
So...what brought it on?

225
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:57,050
医生认为是压力导致
They think it's stress related.

226
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:01,050
-好吧  听着  你要休息一阵  -不  不行
- OK, listen, you're going to take some time off. - No, no way.

227
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:02,510
我们在克罗地亚有房子
We have a place in Croatia you can use.

228
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:04,650
我们就快结束了  我想参与
We're almost done. I want to be part of it.

229
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:07,210
听着  这里没有你能做的事了
Listen, there is nothing for you to do here.

230
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:11,350
-那货物呢  -兹沃诺密尔去就行了
- What about the consignment? - Zvonomir will meet it.

231
00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:13,400
这活一人干就够了
It's one man job.

232
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:16,160
你决定在哪接头了吗
Have you decided where?

233
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,940
如果我告诉你  就得杀了你
Now, if I told you that, I'd have to kill you.

234
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:48,460
你联系这个人
This is who you contact.

235
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:55,420
告诉他我承认
Tell him I will play ball.

236
00:22:57,140 --> 00:23:00,230
但除非我得到保证
But only if I get a guarantee that

237
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:02,030
我家人会被妥善照顾
my family will be taken care of.

238
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:03,430
什么保证
What kind of guarantee?

239
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:07,140
我们是说话算话的人
We're men of our words.

240
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,560
打电话给达沃就行
Just make the call to Davor.

241
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,760
{\an2}{\pos(192,240)}时间正好

242
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,920
{\an2}{\pos(192,240)}但跟你母亲的生日会撞上了

243
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,360
{\an2}{\pos(192,240)}我觉得正好

244
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,880
{\an2}{\pos(192,240)}我不明白

245
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,770
{\an2}{\pos(192,230)}所有人都会在这里  举杯庆祝过去

246
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,680
{\an2}{\pos(192,240)}方圆百英里内所有克罗地亚人

247
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:39,320
{\an2}{\pos(192,230)}而你可以骑着摩托车溜出去锁定我们的未来

248
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,480
{\an2}{\pos(192,240)}我没这么想过

249
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,120
{\an2}{\pos(192,240)}我们最大的一批货物

250
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,650
{\an2}{\pos(192,230)}比我们之前做的所有交易都值钱

251
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:51,340
{\an2}{\pos(192,240)}那就值得庆祝

252
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:06,110
所以克里斯申不会参与交易
So Christian won't be involved with the exchange?

253
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:07,280
对  我们认为不会
No, we don't think so.

254
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:09,190
我们也没法追踪潜艇的位置
And we've no way of tracking the sub?

255
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:11,400
很不幸  是的
Unfortunately, no.

256
00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:14,150
那我们就不知道这些货物会在哪交易
Then we've no idea where the goods will come ashore.

257
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:15,790
但我们知道大概的时间
But we know roughly when.

258
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,590
我们也知道谁要去交易
And we do know who's going to meet them.

259
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:20,470
如果我们能追踪他  他就能带我们到接头点
If we can track him, then he should lead us to the drop off.

260
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:22,880
好  那我们要怎么做
OK, so how do we do that?

261
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:26,670
我们睁一只眼闭一只眼  让克里斯申自己行动
We turn a blind eye and allow Christian to use his initiative.

262
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:28,540
他到目前为止干得很好
He's done all right so far.

263
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:32,520
听着  现在该告诉凯恩吗
Look, is this the moment to brief Kane?

264
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:36,590
最好的情况  我们被文件缠身  结果太迟
At best we get drowned in paperwork and we're too slow.

265
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,530
最差他叫停整个项目
At worst he shuts the whole thing down.

266
00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:42,740
我们就失去了把所有事联系到一起的机会
And we lose our chance to tie the whole thing together.

267
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,280
我们需要枪支
We'll need firearms clearance.

268
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,610
你有行动权限
You have operational authority.

269
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:51,450
还有后援
And back up.

270
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:54,110
你不认为我们能搞定吗
You don't think we can handle this?

271
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:56,290
我们不知道对方是什么人
We've no idea what we'll be up against.

272
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,360
不如告诉芙兰  还有马库斯
What about looping in Fran? Marcus?

273
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,710
太冒险了
It's too risky.

274
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,550
我认识一个人
There's someone I know.

275
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:06,560
我不敢问
I daren't ask.

276
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:08,970
你最好别问
It's better if you don't.

277
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:15,770
是有人被折磨的录像吗
Was it footage of someone being tortured?

278
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:18,600
我只看了一小会
I only saw it for a second.

279
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:20,640
你能...
Will you...

280
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:22,380
拷贝下来吗
..Copy it?

281
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:24,440
我不知道
I don't know.

282
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,610
如果你不帮我  我也无法帮你
I can't help you if you don't help me.

283
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:29,770
谢谢
Thank you.

284
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:32,390
你说过你有照片
And you said you had some photos?

285
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:33,910
对
Yeah.

286
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:36,550
稍等
Hold on.

287
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:39,700
这是我哥哥达沃
That's my brother Davor.

288
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:41,210
这是我妈妈
Erm, that's my mum.

289
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:44,400
你可以忽略那个
Oh, you can ignore that one.

290
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:51,730
-你认识这个女人吗  -对  她是朋友的母亲
- You know this woman? - Yeah, she's a mum of a friend.

291
00:25:51,730 --> 00:25:52,720
但她与此事无关
She's not involved.

292
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:54,460
你能发给我吗
Will you send me those?

293
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,020
好
Yeah.

294
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:07,010
我的当事人想提供口供  供记录在案
My client wishes to make a statement for the record.

295
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:13,320
我想招供
I want to confess.

296
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:18,420
杀了那个警察
To killing that cop.

297
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,220
肖恩·哈迪克吗
Sean Hardacre?

298
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:24,660
我没问他的名字
I didn't ask his name.

299
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:27,800
你能告诉我们发生了什么吗
Will you tell us what happened?

300
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:33,530
我知道他在调查我们
I knew he was keeping tabs on us.

301
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:35,630
不是你
Not you.

302
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:38,080
你怎么知道的
How did you know that?

303
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:42,090
我不记得了
I... I don't remember.

304
00:26:42,090 --> 00:26:43,680
或许我们该让卡巴夏先生
Perhaps we might let Mr Kabashi

305
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,090
把他的口供说完
get to the end of his statement?

306
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:47,220
我给了他一个消息
I fed him a tip off,

307
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:50,660
把他引诱到荒无人烟的地方
lured him to a remote spot.

308
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:54,830
接着说
Go on.

309
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:58,140
本来计划打他一顿
The plan was to rough him up.

310
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:00,280
找出他对我们知道多少
Find out how much he knew.

311
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:03,280
然后呢
And?

312
00:27:04,170 --> 00:27:05,560
他逃了
He escaped.

313
00:27:06,530 --> 00:27:08,780
显然他知道了我的长相
It was obvious he could identify me.

314
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,760
所以我得杀了他
So I had to kill him.

315
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:15,780
那迈克·弗雷斯特呢
And Michael Forrester?

316
00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:18,580
那个农民
The farmer.

317
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:23,970
随便谁吧
Whatever you say.

318
00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:27,930
有证据显示这些凶案
There's evidence that may link these murders

319
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:30,080
与斯特凡·瓦盖奇的谋杀有关
to the killing of Stefan Vargic.

320
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,300
安德里·卡巴夏招供了肖恩的谋杀
Andri Kabashi has confessed to Sean's murder.

321
00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:39,400
真是操蛋
What a crock of shite!

322
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,550
他有可能在说实话吗
Is there any chance he's telling the truth?

323
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:44,120
不  全是胡说
No. It's total bollocks.

324
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,150
但我们没有证据
But we don't have evidence

325
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:47,190
把米密查家族和肖恩的谋杀联系到一起
that connects the Mimicas to Sean's murder.

326
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:48,540
你自己也说了
You said it yourself.

327
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,760
肖恩在调查米密查家族
Sean was investigating the Mimicas,

328
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,250
不是什么安德里·卡巴夏
not Andri fucking Kabashi!

329
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:53,430
我们知道他们有联系
We know they have links.

330
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:55,410
或许肖恩也有安德里的情报
Maybe Sean had intel on Andri, too.

331
00:27:55,410 --> 00:27:57,190
卡巴夏只是个小喽啰
Kabashi is a total nobody.

332
00:27:57,660 --> 00:28:00,120
他没有别人允许都不敢给自己擦屁股
He can't even wipe his backside without someone's permission!

333
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:03,290
我们在他车库找到了俄罗斯特种部队手枪
Well, we found a Russian Special Forces revolver in his garage.

334
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:06,150
-真方便  -而且他还招供了
- Oh, how convenient! - And he happens to have confessed.

335
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:09,180
-有人抢先说服了他  -有人抢先说服了谁
- Someone got to him! - Someone's got to whom?

336
00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:15,230
我的一个线人  长官
A contact of mine, sir.

337
00:28:21,730 --> 00:28:23,950
我们在说其他的案子  长官
We were talking about another investigation, Sir.

338
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:25,600
你走运了
You got lucky.

339
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:29,450
-人得给自己制造运气  -不是这个案子
- You make your own luck, sir. - Not in this case.

340
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:32,190
很遗憾你这么想
I'm sorry you think that.

341
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,630
我想要你团队调查的
I want a full account of every line of inquiry

342
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:39,350
所有线索的详细报告  周五之前放我桌上
your team's been following on my desk by Friday.

343
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:42,340
-周五  -最好是正经报告
- Friday? - And it better be good.

344
00:29:57,230 --> 00:29:58,680
你好吗
Hi. How are you?

345
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:01,220
你看起来糟透了
You look terrible.

346
00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:03,350
他们在医院里说  你...
They said at the hospital, you...

347
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:04,640
我不想谈
I don't wanna talk about it.

348
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:10,690
听着  我有些坏消息
Listen, erm, I'm afraid that I've got some bad news.

349
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:15,500
安德里·卡巴夏供认杀了肖恩
Andri Kabashi confessed to killing Sean.

350
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:17,260
安德里
Andri?

351
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,070
对  他们在他车库找到了凶器
Yeah, they found the murder weapon in his garage.

352
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:22,850
你相信他吗
And you believe him?

353
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:26,670
老大相信  这才是最重要的
Well, the top brass do, and that's all that matters.

354
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:29,770
等等  如果安德里被起诉了
Wait, if Andri's being charged...

355
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:30,720
他死了
He's dead.

356
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:34,660
他的牢房里有刀片
A razor blade in his prison cell.

357
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:38,050
-他们让他背锅了  -对
- They got to him. - Yeah.

358
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:42,050
所以他们不会为肖恩的凶案坐牢吗
So they won't get done for killing Sean?

359
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:47,180
我可能因谋杀坐牢  但他们却不会
I could serve time for murder, but they won't?

360
00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:48,770
克里斯申
Christian,

361
00:30:49,410 --> 00:30:51,960
斯特凡被枪击了三次
Stefan was shot three times.

362
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:55,250
很可能不是你杀了他
It's highly probable that you didn't kill him.

363
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:03,590
我们得继续
We have to keep going.

364
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,890
我不知道该怎么办
I don't know what to do.

365
00:31:07,890 --> 00:31:09,290
我们抓他们现行
We catch them in the act.

366
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:11,580
怎么做
How?

367
00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:15,370
我还有船上的追踪器
I still have one of the trackers from the boat.

368
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:50,180
妈妈
Mum?

369
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:51,420
怎么了
What?

370
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:52,760
又一盆植物
It's another plant.

371
00:31:52,890 --> 00:31:54,040
我不知道该怎么办
I don't know what to do with it.

372
00:31:56,090 --> 00:31:57,670
老天啊
Mother of God.

373
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:00,830
克里斯申  你能帮帮碧昂卡吗
Christian, can you help Bianca, please?

374
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,080
放到露台上
On the terrace.

375
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:06,530
把那画摘掉
Take that down.

376
00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:09,270
达沃让我挂这里
Davor told me to hang it here.

377
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:11,380
我是六十岁  不是八十  拿下来
I'm 60, not 80 . Take it down.

378
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,190
妈妈  蛋糕来了
Ah, Mum, the cakes.

379
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:15,970
放到地下室的储藏柜里
Ah, in the storage cupboard in the basement.

380
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:17,630
克里斯申  我们需要更多酒
Christian, we need more wine.

381
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:18,630
跟我来
Follow me.

382
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:20,230
把那画一起拿上
And bring that with you.

383
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,720
跟上  克里斯申
Keep up, Christian.

384
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,850
真遗憾你母亲不能来
It's such a pity your mother can't come.

385
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:57,370
我们对他还有其他了解吗
Do we know any more about him?

386
00:32:57,790 --> 00:33:00,340
听说他们一起在波斯尼亚服过役
They served together in Bosnia, apparently.

387
00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:02,600
但他是...警察吗
But is he...police?

388
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:03,920
干得好
Well done, you.

389
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:05,600
还有什么
What else do we have?

390
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,300
这装备真不错
That's a great piece of kit.

391
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:11,390
你感觉如何
How are you feeling?

392
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:15,450
谢天谢地我们终于
Thankful that we've finally got

393
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:17,250
有好机会抓住他们了
a decent shot at nailing them.

394
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:20,690
-扎拉特科  -杜布拉芙卡
- Zlatko, ah! - Dubravka!

395
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:21,660
请进
Come in.

396
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:24,110
-齐瓦娜  -杜布拉芙卡
- Zivana! - Dubravka.

397
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,910
-碧昂卡  -请进  请进
- Bianca! - Come in, come in!

398
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:27,960
你长大了
You have grown.

399
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:36,040
你不能现在逃跑
You can't escape now.

400
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,560
我得去继续打扮
I need to finish getting ready.

401
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:44,050
你看着美极了
You look amazing.

402
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,010
好了
Now...

403
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,940
你去多拿点酒
..You go and get more drinks.

404
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:50,170
让大家都有酒
Organise them.

405
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:51,790
好好享受
Enjoy.

406
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,940
听着  我们香槟不够了
Listen, ah, we're running low on champagne.

407
00:34:11,430 --> 00:34:12,550
你先让我拿一些来吗
You want me to fetch some more?

408
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:15,510
对  拿一箱  再拿一瓶佩林科瓦克
Yeah, get a case, and get a bottle of Pelinkovac.

409
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,220
在门边的柜子上
Ah, on the cupboard by the door.

410
00:34:59,270 --> 00:35:00,420
有信号了
We've got a signal.

411
00:35:13,810 --> 00:35:16,990
当我们刚来这里时  大概是
When we first came here, more than...

412
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:21,800
天呐  25年前了  我们一无所有
Ah, God, 25 years ago, we had nothing.

413
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:26,260
我们刚失去了房子  生意
We'd lost our home, our business.

414
00:35:27,770 --> 00:35:30,980
我们失去了我父亲  马克
And we lost my father, Marco.

415
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:34,160
但你不是过来哀悼  妈妈
But you didn't come here to mourn, Mama.

416
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:39,010
你过来为我们所有人建立了更好的生活
You came here to build a better life for all of us.

417
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:43,310
而且从那时起你就为了这个目标努力工作
And you've worked so hard to achieve that ever since,

418
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:44,430
日夜不停
day and night.

419
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:26,290
我很荣幸跟大家一起分享..
It's so great that we can share...

420
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:35,910
齐瓦娜  你给妈妈找了第一份工作
Zivana, you found Mama her first job,

421
00:36:36,690 --> 00:36:37,920
打扫手术室
cleaning at the surgery.
