碧昂卡
Bianca.

10
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:20,490
发生什么了吗
Has something happened?

11
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:21,800
不  我...
No. I...

12
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:23,880
我想跟你谈谈
..I hoped we could talk?

13
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:25,800
斯特凡跟你在一起吗
Is Stefan with you?

14
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:29,910
请我进去吧
Invite me in then.

15
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,130
你想来点吗
Oh, do you want some?

16
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,690
-不  -抱歉
- No. - Sorry.

17
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:46,970
我知道麦当娜红酒餐厅绝不会卖这种垃圾
I know they'd never sell crap like this at Vino Modana.

18
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:50,520
不不  有时离开餐厅也挺好
No, no, it's nice to get away from the restaurant sometimes.

19
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:52,550
我们可以不在那边
I mean, we can talk properly for one thing

20
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:53,980
好好谈谈  所以
when we're not there, so...

21
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:00,100
我其实想跟你谈谈
I wanted to talk to you, actually.

22
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:00,940
行
Sure.

23
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:03,290
是关于斯特凡
It's Stefan, it's...

24
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:05,250
不  我理解
Oh, no, I understand.

25
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:06,780
不是
No, um...

26
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:09,960
我四岁时就认识他了
..I've known him since I was four.

27
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:13,340
我  我妈妈  达沃  我们
Me, my mum, Davor, we're...

28
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:14,980
-我们是他唯一的家人  -嗯
- ..We're all he's got. - Yeah.

29
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:18,010
没事  你不用跟我解释什么
It's OK, you don't need to explain anything.

30
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:18,910
不
No, um...

31
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:23,780
从我记事以来
..We've been destined to be together

32
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:26,100
我们就已经订亲了  而且
for as long as I can remember and...

33
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:27,890
我很在乎他
..I really care for him.

34
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,790
但他不是我每天醒来
But he's not the person I wake up

35
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:35,150
和睡前想念的人
and go to bed thinking about.

36
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:38,850
碧昂卡  这个
Bianca, it's...

37
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,470
碧昂卡  我不
Bianca, I'm not...

38
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:13,390
桑姬塔
Hello, Sangita.

39
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:15,710
见鬼  比利  一周两次
Fuck me, Billy, twice in a week?

40
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:17,470
别担心  你可以黑进英格兰银行
Don't worry, you can be hacking the Bank of England,

41
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:18,540
我也不在乎
for all I care.

42
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:24,430
这次你想要什么
So, what do you want this time?

43
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:30,100
我上周刚帮你黑进去这个
I hacked this for you last week.

44
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:33,250
我需要你大大加强它的加密
I need you to massively strengthen its encryption,

45
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:36,640
让任何试图打开它的人都头疼
make it nigh on impossible for anyone to access.

46
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,650
你能做到吗
Can you do that?

47
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:44,830
还有一件事
And one more thing...

48
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,150
我要你帮我创建一个新账户
I need you to create me a new ID.

49
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:06,730
-克里斯申  -米密查太太
- Christian. - Mrs Mimica.

50
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:08,280
叫我杜布拉芙卡
Dubravka, please.

51
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:10,040
达沃让我过来
Davor asked me to come.

52
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,690
当然  他在阳台
Of course, he's on the terrace.

53
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:15,710
你家真漂亮
You have an amazing home.

54
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:19,260
你第一次来吗
Your first time here?

55
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:22,680
我希望之后还有很多次
I hope the first of many.

56
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,720
{\an2}{\pos(192,240)}他们收到信息了吗

57
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,960
{\an2}{\pos(192,240)}非常清楚

58
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,720
{\an2}{\pos(192,225)}他们很清楚自己会发生什么

59
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:41,770
{\an2}{\pos(192,225)}他们知道会得到什么  以及惹怒我们会失去什么

60
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,590
{\an2}{\pos(192,240)}我们会搞死他们

61
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,320
{\an2}{\pos(192,240)}我们吗

62
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:48,610
怎么回事
What was that?

63
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:50,170
我想你妈妈打碎了什么
I think your mum dropped something.

64
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,340
去看看她是否需要帮忙
Go and see if she needs help.

65
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:57,390
那孩子还以为自己是黑帮呢
Ah, the kid thinks he's a gangster.

66
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:03,370
-我们有个工作给你  -好
- We have a job for you. - Sure.

67
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:06,760
我们需要你租一艘船  快船
We need you to rent a boat, a fast one,

68
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:08,460
能容纳四个人
big enough for four people.

69
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:11,090
至少能开六百英里
Range of at least 600 miles.

70
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:11,970
你什么时候需要
And when do you need it?

71
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:13,560
尽快
Soon as possible.

72
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,490
你没有问题吗
Don't you have any questions?

73
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:23,610
如果需要我知道  你会告诉我
If I need to know, you'll tell me.

74
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,690
{\an8}有些事你该知道  老地方见

75
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,090
六百英里
600 miles?

76
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,800
那可能是任何地方
That could be bloody anywhere.

77
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,520
他们没说其他事吗
And they didn't say anything else?

78
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,420
就这些
That was it.

79
00:07:57,970 --> 00:07:59,870
他们没说还是你没问
They didn't say or you didn't ask?

80
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:01,630
我不想引起怀疑
I didn't want to raise suspicions.

81
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,010
你不能总打安全牌
You can't always play it safe.

82
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:06,390
这是他的决定  比利  不是你的
That's his call, Billy, not yours.

83
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:09,840
我要给船装监听器
I'm going to have to bug the cabin.

84
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,020
-当然  -这是个好主意吗
- Of course. - Is that a good idea?

85
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,470
你知道这种事的套路
You know how this works.

86
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:16,800
我们需要铁证  否则就是捕风捉影
We need hard evidence or we're pissing in the wind.

87
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,070
不  太危险了
Nah, it's too dangerous.

88
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:20,390
这整个行动都很危险
The whole fucking shebang is dangerous.

89
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:23,660
你在冒险这事上没有独断专权  比利
You don't have the monopoly on risk-taking, Billy!

90
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,620
我们都想抓到这群畜生
We all want to catch these fuckers,

91
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,430
只是不会不顾一切
just not at any cost.

92
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:29,420
我以为你说自己不会牵扯进来
I thought you said you weren't going to be involved?

93
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,630
我打算去码头
I'm going to head down to the marina,

94
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,570
问问价格  知道个大概
shop around, get some estimates.

95
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,350
-怎么了  -你有掩饰身份的说辞吗
- What? - Have you got a cover story?

96
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:38,910
什么
A what?

97
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:41,550
如果有人看到你来这  你打算怎么说
You know, what you say if someone sees you coming here.

98
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,110
-你有吗  -见鬼了  别烦我
- Well? - For fuck's sake, stop nagging me.

99
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:45,830
我只是想保护你
I'm just trying to protect you.

100
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:47,290
你现在表现地像我妈
Well, you're behaving like my mother.

101
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:10,770
{\an8}圣尼古拉斯市场

102
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:54,810
你在跟踪我吗
Are you following me?

103
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:58,300
我只是闹着玩
I was just messing around.

104
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:01,520
你来这里干什么
What are you doing in this part of town?

105
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,810
我有事要办
I just had stuff to do.

106
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:03,750
什么事
What stuff?

107
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:06,020
家里事  你知道的
Family shit, you know.

108
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:07,510
不  克里斯申  我不知道
No, Christian, I don't know.

109
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:10,800
-抱歉  我无意...  -我开玩笑的
- Sorry, I didn't mean... - I'm kidding, forget it.

110
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,680
拜托
Come on.

111
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:14,040
谢了
Thanks.

112
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:15,760
那你呢
So, what about you?

113
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:18,400
我过来见一个跟我赌注有关的人
I've been meeting a guy about my bet.

114
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:19,530
你的赌注
Your bet?

115
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:22,900
对  我跟你说的那个
Yeah, you know, the one I told you about.

116
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,170
篮球比赛吗
Oh, the basketball game?

117
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:28,560
不是普通比赛  克里斯申  是欧洲杯
It's not just a game, Christian, it's a European Cup match.

118
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:31,580
如果十字军球队能赢超过三分
And if the Crusaders win by three points or more...

119
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:34,490
我就能赚八万
..I'll make 80 grand.

120
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:35,650
什么
What?

121
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,840
他们的对手是谁
Well, who are they playing?

122
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:39,340
去年的亚军
Last year's runners-up.

123
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:41,770
我以为英国人不擅长篮球
I thought us Brits weren't very good at basketball.

124
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:42,740
确实
We're not.

125
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:44,710
那听上去希望不大
It sounds like a long shot then.

126
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,510
除非比赛被操控了
Not if the game is rigged.

127
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:51,520
你要怎么操纵篮球比赛
How the fuck did you rig a basketball game?

128
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,370
-你也下注吗  -好啊
- Are you in? - Yeah.

129
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:56,810
好  我去弄点现金
Yeah, let me rustle up some cash.

130
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,040
我们比赛之后开派对
We'll party after the game.

131
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:14,280
{\an2}{\pos(192,240)}他不像我想象的那样

132
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:19,630
没人会听到我们  妈  你可以说英语
No-one's going to hear us, Mum. You can speak English.

133
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,250
我想给她找个更好的人
I wanted better for her.

134
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,470
比什么更好
Better than what?

135
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:24,940
斯特凡
Stefan.

136
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:28,790
他就快成为我们中的一员了
He's about to become one of us.

137
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:30,890
他是个傻瓜
He's a fool.

138
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,520
你想让我叫停吗
Do you want me to put a stop to it?

139
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,750
我应该开心
I should be happy.

140
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,520
至少我有个孩子能结婚
At least one of my children will be married.

141
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:49,030
我得走了
I have to go.

142
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:50,920
你要去哪见他
Where are you meeting him?

143

老地方
The usual place.

144
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,720
别再让我等了
Don't keep me waiting again.

145
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,420
你说得对  我需要一个说辞

为什么  发生了什么吗

147

斯特凡举止奇怪
Stefan's acting weird.

148
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:31,960
我们该担心吗
Should we be worried?

149
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:36,420
达沃
Davor...

150
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:41,780
有人刚好有我们餐厅的照片吗
..Somebody just happens to leave the picture of our restaurant

151
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:44,730
放在警局的复印机上
lying on the photocopier of the police station?

152
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:47,000
那是上次调查的照片
It's from the previous investigation.

153
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,570
或其他人接手了

154
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,340
那个死警察的调查
where the dead cop left off.

155
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:55,490
你听到了  谋杀案调查毫无进展
You heard it, the murder investigation is going nowhere.

156

我还听说或许有其他团队在调查
I heard also there may be other teams working on it...

157
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:03,280
但我们的线人并不知道
..That our source doesn't know about.

158
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:05,450
我去处理
I'll take care of it.

159
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,950
很好  你们都在

我有事告诉你们
I have something to tell you.

161
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:55,920

162
00:14:56,870 --> 00:15:00,370
我觉得有人在给警察提供消息
I think someone is feeding information to the police.

163
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,120
你为什么现在才告诉我们
Why are you just telling us this now?

164
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,220
我刚发现
I just found out.

165
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:09,210
达沃  拜托

好
OK, so...

168
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:23,260
你要找什么类型的船
So what exactly are you looking for?

169
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,360
能开六百英里
Something that can do 600 miles.

170
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,580
好  所有船都有标配的绘图机
OK, well, they all come standard with chart plotting,

171
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:30,380
船头和艉侧推器

172
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:33,360

我想没有
I don't think so.

188
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,430
达沃的举止怪异吗

I don't understand why Stefan would point the finger at you.

Maybe he thinks I'm muscling in on his place in the family.

287
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:12,420
你去跟克里斯申和好  听懂没
You make it up with Christian, you understand?

288
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,160
你今天躲过一劫
You dodged a bullet today.

289
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:24,240
-谢天谢地有玛丽安·杰克森  -对  很不错
- Thank God for Marianne Jackson. - Yeah, that was a nice touch.

290
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,790
我们得再小心点
We just have to be more careful.

291
00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:27,640
-我要停止你们的行动  -不行
- I'm shutting you down. - No!

292
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:29,680
我们刚有点起色
We're starting to get somewhere.

293
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,540
听着  是我在冒险
Look, it's my neck on the line.

294
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:34,150
这不是正式批准的调查  克里斯申
This isn't an officially sanctioned investigation, Christian.

295
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:35,550
我们所有人都在冒险
All our necks are on the line.

296
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:37,440
拜托  再给点时间
Please, just let it play out a little longer.

297
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,800
我已经给了你时间
I've already given you time.

298
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:41,860
他用来获取可被法庭采纳的证据了
Which he's used to acquire admissible evidence

299
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:44,090
用来证明一项重大犯罪阴谋
on a major criminal conspiracy.

300
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:45,660
我很确定凯恩警司
Which I'm sure Superintendent Kane

301
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:47,330
会为此感恩
will be hugely grateful for.

302
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:48,680
我不离开餐厅
I'm not leaving the restaurant.

303
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:50,180
-克里斯申  -我不走
- Christian. - I'm not!

304
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,730
直到我们能证明跟肖恩有关
Not until we prove the link to Sean.

305
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:53,620
听着
Look...

306
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,260
我跟你们一样
..I want to catch these scumbags

307
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:58,180
-也想抓住他们  -那就证明啊
- as much as you do. - Then prove it.

308
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:00,530
给我们一点时间
Give us some time.

309
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,910
我们已经很接近了
Look, we're really close.

310
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:04,720
达沃开始接纳我了
Davor's letting me in.

311
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,240
72小时
72 hours...

312
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:11,810
找到联系
..To find the link.

313
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,360
之后我就要过去
After that, I'm coming down there

314
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:16,760
把你拖出来  亲自逮捕你
to drag you out and arrest you myself.

315
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:24,810
我需要再来一瓶啤酒
Well, that calls for a beer.

316
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:40,690
-怎么这么久  -我今早才拿到
- What's taking so long? - I was only given it this morning.

317
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:42,710
我们都等了一周了
We've been waiting almost a week.

318
00:25:43,530 --> 00:25:45,690
你们或许得再多等一阵  伙计
And you might be waiting a lot longer than that, mate.

319
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:49,410
-什么意思  -这东西的加密程度
- How do you mean? - Level of encryption on this.

320
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,080
就像恩尼格玛密码机一样
It's like the sodding Enigma code.

321
00:26:02,290 --> 00:26:04,030
欢迎  请进
Welcome. Come in.

322
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:06,380
-这些给你  -谢谢
- These are for you. - Oh, thank you.

323
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:11,530
-这是我儿子  -很高兴终于见面了
- This is my son. - It's so nice to finally meet you.

324
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:14,050
-我是达沃  -我也很幸会  我是海伦
- I'm Davor. - Very nice to meet you, too. I'm Helen.

325
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:16,160
约万  我侄子
Jovan, my nephew.

326
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,730
-你好  约万  侄子  你好  -你好
- Hello, Jovan, the nephew. Hello. - Hi.

327
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:20,770
这是我女儿  碧昂卡
This is my daughter, Bianca.

328
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,460
你好  很高兴认识你
Oh, hello. Very nice to meet you.

329
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:24,000
-欢迎  -谢谢
- Welcome. - Thank you.

330
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:26,180
还有斯特凡  她未婚夫
And Stefan, her fiance.

331
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:28,060
-你好吗  -欢迎
- Hi. How are you? - Welcome.

332
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:32,540
-约万  帮海伦拿外套  -非常感谢
- Jovan, take Helen's coat, please. - Thank you very much.

333
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,170
-我能帮你拿吗  -好
- Can I get yours? - Yeah, yeah.

334
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:36,110
-外面有点冷  -这边走
- It's a bit chilly out there. - This way.

335
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:38,290
谢谢  房子真美
Thank you. What a lovely house.

336
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:41,190
看着好美味
This looks delicious.

337
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,980
-你在厨房忙了一天吧  -一整天
- Have you been in the kitchen all day? - All day.

338
00:26:45,530 --> 00:26:46,590
向来如此
Always.

339
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:51,650
克里斯申告诉我你前夫是克罗地亚人
So, Christian tells me your ex-husband is from Croatia.

340
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:54,550
对  但他在这里
Yes, but he's lived here for

341
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,740
生活了三十年  所以
the best part of 30 years, so...

342
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:58,620
一日克罗地亚人  永远克罗地亚魂  对吧
You never stop being Croatian, right?

343
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:01,530
我想没人跟尼克说过这个
Well, I'm not sure that anyone's told Nick that.

344
00:27:02,770 --> 00:27:05,650
-你去过那里吗  海伦  -克罗地亚吗  去过
- Have you been there, Helen? - To Croatia? Yeah.

345
00:27:05,810 --> 00:27:10,240
对  克里斯申小时候去度过几次假
Yeah, a couple of times on holiday when Christian was small.

346
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:13,430
-你们去哪了  -我们去了小岛  哈瓦
- Where did you go? - Oh, we went to an island. Havar.

347
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:15,520
那里叫哈瓦尔
It's pronounced Hvar.

348
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,610
哈瓦尔  哈瓦尔吗
Hvar? Hvar?

349
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:19,470
-我说得对吗  -对  完美
- Is that right? - Yeah. Perfect.

350
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:22,980
哈瓦尔  我们去了哈瓦尔
Hvar. We went to Hvar.

351
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,800
-你喜欢那里吗  -超爱
- And did you like it? - Yes, loved it.

352
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:27,030
美如仙境
Absolutely beautiful.

353
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:30,390
但有一个假期  克里斯申
But there was one holiday when Christian

354
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:33,080
-非常害怕  -害怕
- got absolutely terrified. - Terrified?

355
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:36,670
对  有一种林鸽
Yeah. There were these wood pigeons

356
00:27:36,670 --> 00:27:39,530
克里斯申觉得它们的叫声像狼
and Christian thought that they sounded like wolves.

357
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:41,620
-真可爱  -是啊
- How adorable. - Yeah.

358
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:45,840
-他那个年龄肯定很好看  -确实  确实
- I bet he was gorgeous at that age. - Yeah, he was, he was.

359
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,280
-他就是个妈宝  -妈  别说了
- He was a real mummy's boy. - Mum, stop.

360
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:52,090
真的吗  妈宝  但你从没去监狱探望过他
Really? Mummy's boy? But you never visited him in jail.

361
00:27:54,610 --> 00:27:57,520
斯特凡  你在侮辱我们的客人
Stefan, you are insulting our guest.

362
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,320
不
No.

363
00:27:58,690 --> 00:28:00,390
不不  没关系
No, no, no, it's OK.

364
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:05,090
我  我不否认当时我觉得很丢脸
I... I don't mind admitting I was ashamed of him.

365
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:07,560
但我现在不是了
But I'm not now.

366
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,050
自从他跟你们在一起
Ever since he's been with you,

367
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:14,030
自从他来到你们的餐厅  我...
ever since he's been in your restaurant, I...

368
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,730
我说不出自己有多骄傲
I can't tell you how proud of him I am.

369
00:28:29,930 --> 00:28:30,860
敬家人
To family.

370
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:32,580
敬家人
To family.

371
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:41,070
我很抱歉我们怀疑了你
I'm sorry we doubted you.

372
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:43,040
没必要
There's really no need.

373
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:46,490
我不该听他的
I shouldn't have listened to him.

374
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:50,960
换了我也会这么做
I would have done the same.

375
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:55,370
我们认为有人在给警察
We believe someone is supplying information

376
00:28:55,370 --> 00:28:56,940
提供我们的信息
to the police about us.

377
00:28:57,850 --> 00:28:59,040
家里人吗
Someone in the family?

378
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:01,830
或熟人
Or close to it.

379
00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:04,920
我猜他忍不住
I suppose he hasn't been able to

380
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,850
炫耀克拉伊纳的事
resist boasting about Krajina.

381
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:10,350
他跟我说了一些
He's told me a little.

382
00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:16,240
现在你知道我们为什么要额外警觉  甚至多疑
Now you know why we need to be extra vigilant. Paranoid even.

383
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,270
当然
Of course.

384
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:21,610
那会让我们非常富裕
It is going to make us very rich.

385
00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:23,680
我们所有人
All of us.

386
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:27,090
包括你
You included.

387
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:46,170
你以前杀过人吗
Have you ever killed anyone?

388
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:52,470
但你觉得你能行吗
But do you think you could?

389
00:29:54,690 --> 00:29:55,720
我想不行
I don't think so.

390
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:01,590
我想你会让自己惊讶的
I think you're going to surprise yourself.

391
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:06,480
杀人只需要勇气
All it takes is character...

392
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:10,560
而你有很多
..And you have plenty of that.

393
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:22,160
这只是说说
Look, it's just talk.

394
00:30:23,370 --> 00:30:25,320
他在获取情报  仅此而已
He's marking his card, that's all.

395
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:28,420
让他知道他们是认真的
Letting him know they mean business.

396
00:30:30,890 --> 00:30:31,860
看这个
Here, look at this.

397
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,100
-那是他们要租的船吗  -对
- Is that the boat they're hiring? - Aye.

398
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:38,340
之前是渔船
Ex-fishing charter.

399
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:42,430
航行过几次  但状态依旧很好
Done a few knots, but still in good nick.

400
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:46,240
我应该能在那块板后面
I should be able to plant the listening device

401
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,940
装上监听器
behind that panel there.

402
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:51,640
很高科技
Pretty high-tech.

403
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:54,420
-Q最近很忙啊  -对
- Q has been busy. - Aye.

404
00:30:55,450 --> 00:30:58,010
运动激活的录音监听设备
Motion activated recording and listening device.

405
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:02,090
不是买一送一的标准警察监听破烂
None of your buy-one-get-one-free standard issue police crap.

406
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,380
如果你拿不到上好的监听器
Well, you wouldn't be much of a spook

407
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:06,220
那你也算不上什么好间谍
if you couldn't get your mitts on a decent listening device,

408
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:08,220
比利  是不是
Billy, would you now?

409
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:27,930
有东西吗
Anything?

410
00:31:29,170 --> 00:31:30,190
没问题
It's clean.

411
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:48,760
那么
So...

412
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:51,270
我们和好了
..We're cool?

413
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,190
嗯  和好了  斯特凡
Yeah, we're cool, Stefan.

414
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:58,610
很好  因为我需要你帮忙
Good, because I need your help.

415
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:04,220
你记得我说能赢八万的那场篮球赛吧
You remember I stand to win 80 grand on this basketball game?

416
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:06,400
这数字可不容易忘
It's not a number you forget.

417
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:10,400
我想或许
Well, I thought maybe...

418
00:32:12,810 --> 00:32:14,600
我们可以用这钱来干个买卖
..We could use it to set up shop together.

419
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:16,530
你和我吗
Me and you?

420
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:20,010
我得开始自立门户  达沃生我气了
I need to start doing my own shit. Davor is pissed with me.

421
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:22,790
如果他发现我们在他的地盘上贩毒
He's going to be even more pissed

422
00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:23,950
那他会更加生气
if we start dealing on his patch.

423
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:27,550

430
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,450
就杀了他们全家
if they don't come through.

你得想清楚是否该再信任我

441
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:34,960

443
00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:45,540

-斯特凡  我...  -没事

你什么都不用说  我不傻
You don't have to say anything. I'm not stupid.

446

但如果你真是我的朋友
But if you really are my friend...

447
00:33:58,910 --> 00:34:00,350
那你就知道我有多爱她
..Then you know how much I love her.

448

我想纹个碧昂卡  但太疼了
I wanted to write Bianca, but it hurt too much.

449
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:17,030

450
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:18,520
不能告诉任何人
You can't say this to anyone.

451
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:19,630

你不用威胁我
You don't need to threaten me.

458

别低估他们
Don't underestimate them...

我该当作没看到吗
