我不确定
I'm not sure.

听说是个遛狗的人
Some guy walking his dog, apparently.

那会毁了你的一整天
That would ruin your day.

关于他的家庭  关于碧昂卡

..listen to me. I know now... Everything's a lie!

30

这很正常  但没关系
I mean, it's natural, but it's fine.

他会回来的

他会回来的
He'll turn up.

00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:43,920
-你就发信息给我  或者...  -好

我可以让你们俩处理  对吧
So I can leave you two to it, yeah?

00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:05,460
但你能尽快来老地方见我吗
but will you meet me back at the usual place as soon as possible?

克里斯申  什么
Christian, what...

48
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:26,420
你在干什么  住手
What are you doing? Stop it.

49
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:27,420
放开我
Get your hands off me.

50
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:29,000
克里斯申  住手
Christian, stop it!

51

够了  你听到了吗
Enough! Do you hear me?

52
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,920
比利  怎么回事
Billy, what has happened?

53
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,920
斯特凡·瓦盖奇死了
Stefan Vargic is dead.

54
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:39,320
你杀了他
You killed him!

55
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:41,280
不
No!

56
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:43,760
克里斯申  天呐
Christian... Oh, my God.

57
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:47,080
-住手  -是你的朋友  米密查家族
- Stop it. - Your friends, the Mimicas,

58
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:49,660
对  但你差不多也算扣下了扳机
Yeah, but you might as well have pulled the trigger!

59
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:52,640
住手  克里斯申  克里斯申
Stop it! Christian... Christian!

60
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,160
你觉得会怎么样
What did you expect?

61
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:58,880
-我不知道  克里斯申  我以为  -什么
- I don't know, Christian. I thought that... - What?

62
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:02,680
跟警察交好能给他一枚奖牌吗
Give him a gold fucking star for cosying up a police officer?

63
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,840
我觉得你最好离开  比利
I think you'd better go, Billy.

64
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:18,440
我是想保护你
I was trying to protect you.

65
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,080
克里斯申
Christian...

66
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:13,480
克里斯申
Christian?

00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:16,070
坐起来
Sit up.

68
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,000
喝掉这个
You drink this.

69
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:31,640
是什么
What is it?

70
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:33,960
加了白兰地的茶
It's tea with brandy.

71
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,470
你受惊了
You're in shock.

72
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:46,130
你在场吗
Were you there?

73
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:53,120
你看到事发经过了吗
Did you see it happen?

74
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:57,410
谁打死了他
Who shot him?

75
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:02,380
拜托  克里斯申  这很重要
Please, Christian, it's important.

76
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:04,280
谁打死了斯特凡
Who shot Stefan?

77
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:23,400
拜托
Please...

78
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,080
克里斯申
Christian...

79
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:28,510
谁打死了他
..who shot him?

80
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:53,760
我快结束了
I'm almost finished.

81
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:00,600
怎么了
What is it?

82
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:01,800
大家都在哪
Where is everyone?

83
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:02,960
谁
Who?

84
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:05,080
斯特凡  克里斯申
Well, Stefan, Christian.

85
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,600
我联系不到他们俩
I can't get hold of either of them.

86
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,660
你为什么联系克里斯申
Why are you calling Christian?

87
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:10,320
问他有没有看到斯特凡
To ask if he's seen Stefan.

88
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:20,560
斯特凡在克罗地亚
Stefan is in Croatia.

89
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:22,880
从什么时候开始
Since when?

90
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:26,680
昨晚
Last night.

91
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:29,120
怎么  都不说再见吗
What, without saying goodbye?

92
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:35,320
他需要消失
He needed to disappear.

93
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:39,560
他干了什么
What did he do?

94
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:46,200
你知道最好别问
You know better than to ask that.

95
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,240
他什么时候会回来
And when will he be back?

96
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,680
他不回来了
He's not coming back.

97
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:17,080
这不会改变我对你的看法
This doesn't change the way I feel about you.

98
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:19,120
你知道  对吧
You know that, right?

99
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:24,760
它改变了我对自己的看法
It changes the way I feel about myself.

100
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:27,680
-不是他死就是你亡  -妈
- It was him or you. - Mum.

101
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:31,380
我对他的死不感到惋惜
I-I'm not sorry he's dead.

102
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,100
别说了
Please, stop.

103
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,380
我不在乎别人
I don't care about anyone.

104
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:37,320
我只在乎让你离开这危险的局面
I just care about getting you out of this mess.

105
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:39,180
我得回去了
I have to go back.

106
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,130
那不行
Well, that's not gonna happen,

107
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,860
因为我不允许
because I won't allow it.

108
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:43,640
他们不会让我就这样离开
They won't just let me walk away.

109
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,760
那你就躲起来
Then you'll go into hiding.

110
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:46,980
下半辈子都躲吗
For the rest of my life?

111
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,340
直到我们抓到他们
Until we nail them.

112
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:49,560
那是什么时候
And when will that be?

113
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:54,040
你没有任何线索证明米密查家族和肖恩的死有关
You have nothing to link the Mimicas to Sean's murder.

114
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:58,580
没有我  你根本没有机会把他们绳之于法
And without me you've got no chance pulling the stroke of bastards.

115
00:10:58,580 --> 00:10:59,960
我不再在乎了
I don't care any more.

116
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:04,780
跟达沃说  告诉他你受够了想退出
Talk to Davor, tell him that you've had enough and you want out.

117
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:06,610
他有你用过的枪
He's got the gun that you used.

118
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:09,000
他知道你不会告密
He knows you'll keep your mouth shut.

119
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:15,000
否则他会让自己受牵连
He'd have to incriminate himself.

120
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:17,640
他不会冒这个险
He'd never risk it.

121
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,320
你会告诉蒂娜吗
Will you tell Tina?

122
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:30,600
不会
Nothing.

123
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:33,190
她不必知道
She never needs to know.

124
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:37,240
比利呢
And Billy?

125
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,440
别担心比利
Don't worry about Billy.

126
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:42,840
他会想明白的  如果他还没发现的话
He'll work it out, if he hasn't already.

127
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,400
你确定吗
Are you sure?

128
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:02,360
克里斯申确定是他
Christian ID'd him.

129
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:05,160
他看到了吗
Did he witness it?

130
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:07,690
我想没有
I don't think so.

131
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:10,840
-但他可以作证  -不行
- But could he testify? - No.

132
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:13,630
他还好吗
Is he all right?

133
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:14,920
你觉得呢
What do you think?

134
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:20,620
但他现在接受我们得撤出他了吗
But does he accept now that we have to pull him out?

135
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:21,400
不行
No.

136
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:27,790
他认为米密查家族是在交易前清理内务
He thinks the Mimicas were tidy in-house before the deal.

137
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:29,500
他并不知道
He can't be sure of that.

138
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,120
但他是深入虎穴的人
But he's the man on the ground here.

139
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:36,260
他很坚信有大事要发生
He's adamant something big's about to happen.

140
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:38,400
而且他很安全
And that he's completely safe.

141
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:39,800
听着
Look,

142
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:44,520
如果我们抓到他们现场交易白粉
if we can catch them in the act of smuggling the coke,

143
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:46,860
再加上克里斯申的录音
along with the audio Christian's recorded

144
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:48,800
和肖恩电脑里的文件
and the files from Sean's computer,

145
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:52,440
这就是实打实的铁证
it all adds up to a solid bust.

146
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:55,080
这证明了肖恩在追查他们
It proves Sean was onto them,

147
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,660
并且对方有杀他的动机
and a motive for his murder.

148
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:59,300
但如果我们不把斯特凡的事告诉凯恩
But if we don't tell Kane about Stefan

149
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:01,920
之后他发现我们早就知道  那...
and it comes out later that we knew, then...

150
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:06,120
你有合理的借口
You have plausible deniability.

151
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:09,560
这都是国家犯罪调查局的
This is all masterminded by some

152
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:12,340
流氓探员一手策划的
rogue operative from the NCA.

153
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:15,080
这差不多也是事实
Which is more or less the bloody truth.

154
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,960
你说过我们有72小时
You said we had 72 hours.

155
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:21,120
对
Yeah.

156
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,520
而且时间快到了
And they're almost up.

157
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:31,640
流浪者回来了
The wanderer returns.

158
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:34,800
你可算回来了
There you are.

159
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:56,160
你见到斯特凡了吗
Have you seen Stefan?

160
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:57,440
没有
No.

161
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:59,560
达沃说他回克罗地亚了
Davor said he's in Croatia.

162
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:02,240
-克罗地亚  -对  他是这么说的
- Croatia? - Well, that's what he said.

163
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:04,110
克里斯申  怎么回事
Christian, what's going on?

164
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:05,440
我得跟他谈谈
I have to go and speak to him.

165
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:16,440
-达沃  -你来迟了
- Davor? - You're late.

166
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:19,270
一天可以  不能连着两天
One day's OK, not two in a row.

167
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:24,140
尤其是现在斯特凡在克罗地亚
Especially with Stefan in Croatia.

168
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:25,800
-对  我想跟你谈谈这个  -坐下
- Yeah, but that's what I wanted to sp... - Sit.

169
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:27,360
-达沃  我...  -坐
- Davor, I.. - Sit.

170
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:42,670
我需要你展示出勇气
I need you to show character.

171
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:44,440
你能做到吗
Can you do that?

172
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:48,800
因为我们谈过的事
Cos the thing we talked about...

173
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:49,720
克拉伊纳
Krajina.

174
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:51,480
从今天开始
..it starts today.

175
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:54,960
克里斯申
Christian...

176
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:58,440
过去的已经过去了
..what's done is done.

177
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,300
我是克里斯申  请留言
This is Christian. Say something.

178
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:31,280
别又玩失踪
Not again.

179
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:34,520
我想他肯定有理由
I'm sure there's an explanation.

180
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,160
已经快两小时了
It's been almost two hours.

181
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:40,060
我再给他发信息
I'll try texting him again.

182
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:41,640
天呐
Oh, God.

183
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,320
你得冷静
You need to calm down.

184
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:30,400
不能带手机
No phones.

185
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:38,030
有消息吗
Anything?

186
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:41,320
信号肯定很弱
The signal must be weak.

187
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:45,950
有了
There we go.

188
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:49,200
那是哪里
Well, where's that?

189
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:52,160
玛丽娜酒店
The Marina Hotel.

190
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:59,000
先生们  欢迎来到布里斯托

191
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:10,760

00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:14,760
-我们说过不能带手机  -放松

195

看着熟悉吗
Look familiar?

196
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:25,240
那是什么
What's that?

197
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:28,920
我们喝一杯吧
Let's have a drink, huh?

198
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:30,960
他戴着监听器
He's carrying a bug.

199
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:32,440
监听器
A bug?

200
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:35,880
敬成功行动
To a successful operation.

201
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:38,320
见鬼
Shit.

00:18:57,420 --> 00:19:00,240
告诉我  你的旅途还顺利吗
So, tell me, how was your trip?

203
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,040
不太牢靠
Shaky.

204
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:05,600
这家伙怎么回事
What's wrong with this guy?

205
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:06,950
抱歉
Sorry.

206
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:11,800
也许  他病了
Maybe...he's sick?

207
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:12,920
让他出去
Get him out of here.

208
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:18,620
你觉得他需要支援吗
Do you think he needs backup?

209
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:19,560
不  让他去
No, leave him.

210
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,160
他心中有数
He knows what he's doing.

211
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,200
我不能坐视不管

212
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:26,680
汉娜  你要去哪

克里斯申  你得站起来
Christian, you have to get up.

222
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:06,240
我们得离开这里
We have to get out of here!

223

It's ok.

225
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:17,680
你在这干什么
What are you doing in there?

226
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:19,560
我感觉不舒服
Well, I...don't feel very well.

227
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:22,640
你得回去了
You need to come back now.

228
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:24,040

Yeah, whenever. It's not going anywhere.

231
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:46,560
我们都一样
It was the same for all of us.

232
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:50,920
第一次杀人  这是
The first time you kill, it's...

233
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:55,840
这是对勇气的终极考验
It's the ultimate test of character.

234
00:21:58,620 --> 00:21:59,570
你会没事的
You'll be fine.

235
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:15,580

-只有在需要这样的时候  -不
- Only when I need to be. - No.

你太鲁莽了  汉娜

但我没有
Well, I didn't,

240
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:23,760
我也不需要你跟我说教鲁莽的事  比利
and I don't need a lecture from you on being reckless, Billy.

241
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:31,880
至少他又回来了

我在广播里听到

商讨这方面事宜时克里斯申不在屋里
Christian wasn't in the room when it was discussed.

284
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:40,620

听着  这次感觉不同

286

这不是一次性交易
It's not a single deal.

287
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:47,600
我觉得后面有更大的局

而且这两人不是闹着玩的  我能确定
And these two are serious business, I can tell.

289
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,540
他们肯定在我们的侦查范围里
They've got to be on our radar.

290
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:54,640
全国警察电脑系统吗
On pnc?

291
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:57,830
可能吗
Are they fuck!

292
00:25:58,740 --> 00:25:59,600
不
No.

293
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:01,720
我是说我们的系统
I mean our radar.

294
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:04,520
那你能问问老同事吧
And you can ask someone, I presume.

295
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:07,490
听着  我们快要收尾了
Listen, we're at the business end now.

296
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:10,620
达沃在十天前说还剩三周
Davor said three weeks and that was ten days ago.

297
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:11,880
最坏的情况
At worst,

298
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:16,000
这能让我们进行大型白粉缉毒行动
this lead could be our ticket to a massive coke bust.

299
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:18,640
想想把这个结果交给凯恩
Imagine taking that to Kane

300
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:21,880
并给他深深鞠个躬
with a great big fucking bow on it.

301
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:25,680
好吧
All right.

302
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:28,320
继续查
Keep digging.

303
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:32,120
听着  我需要你们在总部露露脸
Look, I need you to show your faces at HQ.

304
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:34,280
我已经快没借口了
I'm running out of excuses.

305
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:56,010
芙兰  你还在跟进肖恩·哈达克的案子吗
Fran, are you still working the Sean Hardacre case?

306
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:57,660
必须的
For my sins.

307
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:59,800
你不是说他们用了自制子弹吗
Didn't you say they used home-made bullets?

308
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:02,440
对
Yeah.

309
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:06,680
用了奇怪的西洋棋图案
With some weird chequerboard design

310
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:07,860
塞进了弹药筒的底部
pressed into the base of the cartridge.

311
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:09,080
对  我想也是
Yeah, I thought so.

312
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:10,800
为这个干什么
Why do you ask?

313
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:12,600
在树林发现的尸体
That body they found in the woods,

314
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:14,920
用的是同样的子弹
shot with exactly the same ammo.

315
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,060
一枪打在胸上
One to the chest

316
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:17,520
另一枪爆头毙命
and one to the head to finish him off.

317
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:21,280
-你确定吗  -百分百
- Are you sure? - Oh, 100%.

318
00:27:21,490 --> 00:27:22,340
不是普通布里斯托
Not exactly the ammo of choice

319
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:24,040
小混混们会选择的弹药  对吧
of your average Bristol low-life, is it?

320
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:27,100
谢谢
Thanks.

321
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:31,320
我觉得他们刚认出了他  如果你感兴趣
I think they've just identified him, if you're interested.

322
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:53,000
我们就不能在酒店酒吧见面吗  哪怕就一次
Couldn't we meet in a nice hotel bar, just for once?

323
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:54,800
你的规矩  不是我定的
Your rules, not mine.

324
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:57,560
这鬼地方
Godforsaken shithole.

325
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:02,280
这最好是好消息
This better be good.

326
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:07,720
我们的线人听到老家伙被称为上校
Our source heard the older guy referred to as the Colonel.

327
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:10,820
如果你仔细看
If you look closely,

328
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:13,320
会发现另一个人耳朵有残疾
you'll see the other guy has a mangled ear.

329
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:15,920
在刚果被打掉了
It was shot off in the Congo.

330
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:18,000
那你认识他们咯
You know them, then?

331
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:21,520
艾蒂安·德克勒克
Etienne Declerck.

332
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:24,280
左边是文森特·克莱蒙斯
The one on the left is Vincent Clemens.

333
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:27,280
以前是比利时特种部队
Belgian special forces back in the day.

334
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:29,560
军火商
Arms dealers.

335
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:32,000
雇佣兵
Mercenaries.

336
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:34,960
他们怎么会出现在你的调查里
How have they popped up on your radar?

337
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:40,200
他们跟我们盯着的毒贩打了交道
They're playing footsie with a drug gang in our patch.

338
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:44,640
那你就有问题了  朋友
Then you have got a problem, my friend.

339
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:46,880
为什么
Why do you say that?

340
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:50,320
如果你找上他们  八成是要挑起战争  
Those are the guys you call if you want to start a war.

341
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:16,400
没事了
It's OK.

342
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,050
怎么了
What's wrong?

343
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:21,650
斯特凡死了
Stefan's dead.

344
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:24,000
你确定吗
Are you sure?

345
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:25,730
我看到照片了
I've seen a photo.

346
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:28,850
你知道吗
Did you know?

347
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:31,880
-真的  你不知道吗  -不
- Really, you didn't know? - No.

348
00:29:35,170 --> 00:29:37,120
如果他们能杀他  他们也能杀你
If they can shoot him, they can shoot you, too.

349
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:40,900
-我得叫停这一切  -为什么  碧昂卡
- I've got to put a stop to this. - Why? Bianca...

350
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:42,410
不  我已经报警了
No, I've already called the police,

351
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:44,160
告诉他们死者是斯特凡
told them it was Stefan.

352
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:46,540
我是匿名举报的
I called anonymously.

353
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:47,490
碧昂卡
Bianca?

354
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:53,330
碧昂卡  那些桌子不会自己变干净
Bianca, those tables won't lay themselves.

355
00:29:58,830 --> 00:29:59,800
你还好吗
You ok?

356
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:04,040
-感觉好些了吗  -嗯  好点了  谢谢
- Feeling better? - Yeah, a little. Thanks.

357
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:19,050
-达沃  -我不想听
- Davor. - I don't want to hear it.

358
00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:21,190
不是同一把枪
It's not the same gun.

359
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:23,130
但是同一种子弹
It's the same fucking bullets!

360
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:25,610
见鬼
Fuck!

361
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:28,250
我就知道我们不该把他埋在那里
I knew we shouldn't have buried him there.

362
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:34,760
那我们该怎么办
So, what shall we do?

363
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:38,920
给他们想要的东西
Give them what they're looking for.

364
00:30:50,870 --> 00:30:53,280
你的人确认他们身份了吗
Did... Did your guy ID them?

365
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:55,250
他们是军火商
They're arms dealers.

366
00:30:56,390 --> 00:30:59,330
有道理  他们需要武器
Well, that makes sense. They'll need fire power.

367
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:02,560
这些家伙贩卖的不是那种武器
Not the kind of fire power these guys specialise in.

368
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:07,120
稍等
Excuse me a second.

369
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:13,800
天呐
Christ!

370
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:15,600
怎么了
What?

371
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:20,920
碧昂卡刚给总部的人匿名举报
Bianca's just given someone at HQ an anonymous tip off...

372
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:22,890
关于斯特凡
..about Stefan.

373
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:25,320
见鬼  我们知道是谁吗
Shit! Do we know who?

374
00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:27,210
他没说
He doesn't say.

375
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:30,830
天呐  他们会联系到米密查家族
Oh, God, they'll make the connection to the Mimicas

376
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:32,440
然后找到克里斯申
and then onto Christian.

377
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:34,000
蒂娜联系你了吗
Has Tina called you?

378
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:36,800
没有  但她肯定要疯了
No, but she'll be losing her shit.

379
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:38,770
我们有人得跟她谈谈
Well, one of us needs to speak to her.

380
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:40,880
我去吧
I'll do it.

381
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:51,840
-汉娜  -薇姬
- Hannah. - Hi, Vicky.

382
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:55,290
我不知道你今天会来
I didn't know you were coming in today.

383
00:31:57,820 --> 00:31:58,990
大家都在哪
Where is everyone?

384
00:31:58,990 --> 00:32:00,170
在大会议室
The big meeting room.

385
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:04,040
嗯  我最好悄悄溜进去
Right. Better stick my head in.

386
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:09,870
芙兰  汉娜请了病假
And, Fran, Hannah is off sick.

387
00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:10,870
我不知道细节
I don't have the details.

388
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:12,750
那不是我的部门  你跟人力说去
That's not my department. Take it up with HR.

389
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:14,320
简直是胡说八道
That's utter bullshit!

390
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:17,970
汉娜
Hannah.

391
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:20,050
你的耳朵肯定烫了
Your ears must've been burning.

392
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:22,200
-我们正在谈论你  -是吗
- We were just talking about you. - Were you?

393
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:25,580
对  芙兰问你是否真的请了病假
Yeah, Fran was asking if you've really been signed off sick.

394
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:27,460
抱歉  汉娜  我没有暗示什么
I'm sorry, Hannah. I didn't mean to imply anything.

395
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:29,950
-我们知道这对你打击很大  -对我们都是
- We know how hard it's hit you. - It has all of us.

396
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:32,420
我们没有了解调查的所有内容
We're not being properly looped in on the investigation.

397
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:33,770
我很抱歉如果你感觉
I'm sorry if you feel

398
00:32:33,770 --> 00:32:35,100
我让你们失望了
I've let you all down.

399
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:36,630
没人有这个意思
No-one is suggesting that.

400
00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:39,390
只是感觉一半的队伍都不见了
It just feels like half the team is missing.

401
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:40,850
在我们最需要人手的时候
When we can least afford it.

402
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:41,780
而且我们重重受阻
And we're being obstructed.

403
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:44,070
太可笑了  没人在阻碍你们
That is ridiculous. No-one is obstructing you!

404
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:47,020
那为什么花了一周我们才拿到肖恩的笔记本
So why has it taken nearly a week to get hold of Sean's laptop?

405
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:49,910
为什么我们从其他渠道找到了斯特凡·瓦盖奇
And why do we only find out second hand about Stefan Vargic

406
00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:52,500
而他和肖恩的谋杀案明明存在着明显联系
when there's clearly a link between his and Sean's murders?

407
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:53,690
你能证明吗
Can you prove that?

408
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:56,920
两起谋杀使用的是同一种子弹
The same ammunition was used in both killings.

409
00:32:57,710 --> 00:32:58,890
手工制作
It's handmade.

410
00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:00,430
很特别
It's distinctive.

411
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:03,060
所以呢  有人做了一批子弹并卖给
So? Somebody makes a batch and flogs it

412
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:04,870
布里斯托的懒蛋混混
to all the ne'er-do-wells in Bristol.

413
00:33:04,870 --> 00:33:05,870
这证明不了什么
It doesn't prove anything.

414
00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:07,590
这证明两起案件有联系
It suggests there's a connection.

415
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:09,430
如果有联系我肯定会知道
Pretty sure I'd know about it if there was one.

416
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:11,630
你不能一周多不来
You can't just turn up after more than a week

417
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:13,970
然后突然出现用权力压我们
and start throwing your weight around, Billy.

418
00:33:13,990 --> 00:33:15,080
我没有
I'm not.

419
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:17,840
那你为什么认为你知道任何有价值的信息呢
So, what makes you think you know anything remotely useful?

420
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:20,970
斯特凡·瓦盖奇是我的线人
Stefan Vargic was on my list.

421
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:23,630
什么
What?

422
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:25,680
他是我的线人
He was one of my contacts.

423
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:27,870
你为什么不告诉我们
Why didn't you tell us?

424
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:30,090
我现在告诉你们了
I'm telling you now.

425
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:32,720
那你怎么确定这两者之间没有联系
And what makes you so sure there's no connection?

426
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:36,180
瓦盖奇和他的人都是小混混  我就是知道
Vargic and his crew are total no-marks. I just know it.

427
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,090
他跟谁一起混
Who was he with?

428
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:39,520
克罗地亚家族  经营城里的一家餐厅
Croatian family, runs a restaurant in town.

429
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:41,090
只是小打小闹
They're small fry.

430
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:43,920
-但有人认为应该杀了他  -对
- Yet someone thought it worthwhile killing him? - Aye.

431
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:46,160
真是令人意外
That was a bit of a shocker.

432
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:48,720
我需要知道发生了什么
I need to know what's going on.

433
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:50,880
你个自私的无赖  比利
You're a selfish twat, Billy.

434
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:52,610
我很抱歉你这么想
I'm sorry you think that.

435
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:54,270
肖恩·哈达克被谋杀了
Sean Hardacre has been killed.

436
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:56,480
所以跟大家合作吧
So start being a team player.

437
00:33:58,070 --> 00:34:01,520
我会分享我这边的线索  我保证
I'll share whatever I find out, I promise.

438
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:03,090
只是
Just...

439
00:34:04,150 --> 00:34:05,440
只是再给我一两天
Just give me a day or two.

440
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,070
{\an8}切换SIM卡

441
00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:33,260
紧急情况  你需要什么服务
Emergency. Which service do you require?

442
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:34,570
请接警察
Police, please.

443
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:40,600
我有关于警察遇害事件的消息
I have information relating to the murder of the police officer.

444
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:44,240
我不想说
I'd rather not say.

445
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:48,680
不  抱歉  不行
No, I'm sorry, I can't.

446
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:53,500
我知道凶器在哪
Well, I know where the weapon is

447
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:54,920
用来杀他的凶器
which was used to kill him.

448
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:35,760
这招很妙
That was a smart play.

449
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:38,360
至少给我们争取了时间
Buys us a wee bit of time at least.

450
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:41,710
还有米密查家族收到的任何信息
And any information gets fed back to the Mimicas.

451
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:43,330
如果内鬼在屋里
If the source is in the room.

452
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:49,240
听着  我刚才的话不是真心的
Listen, I, I didn't mean what I said.

453
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:51,610
说我是个自私的无赖吗
About me being a selfish twat?

454
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:57,480
我认罪  法官大人
Guilty as charged, your honour.

455
00:35:58,310 --> 00:36:00,050
听着  我知道
Look I-I know that...

456
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:04,050
我知道你在照顾他
..I know you're looking out for him.

457
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:15,350
你开玩笑吧  "没有证据"
You're joking, aren't you? "No evidence."

458
00:36:15,350 --> 00:36:17,670
-他们是这么说的吗  -对  什么也没有  天呐
- Is that what they said? - Yeah, nothing. Jesus.

459
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:19,410
正是我要找的女人
Just the woman I'm looking for.

460
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,980
有人举报
Someone's called in a tip

461
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:23,490
杀死肖恩·哈达克的枪支
about the gun used to kill Sean Hardacre.

462
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:25,880
有印象吗
Ring any bells?

463
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:29,000
你想一起来吗
You fancy tagging along?

464
00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:30,290
肯定
You bet.

465
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:32,800
有什么有趣的事吗
Anything interesting?

466
00:36:33,070 --> 00:36:35,520
我们可能知道了一个谋杀凶器的下落
We may know the whereabouts of one of the murder weapons.

467
00:36:36,830 --> 00:36:37,690
好
Ok.

468
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:39,800
随时通知我
Keep me informed.

469
00:36:50,590 --> 00:36:51,880
卡巴夏先生
Mr Kabashi...

470
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:55,560
我们在你的车库里找到了这个
..we found it in your garage.

471
00:36:58,270 --> 00:36:59,980
我的当事人对手枪一无所知
My client has no knowledge of the weapon

472
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:01,570
也不知为何在那
or how it got there.

473
00:37:02,270 --> 00:37:04,470
所以有人栽赃了你吗
So, somebody planted it?

474
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:06,000
他是这么说的
That's what he says.

475
00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:10,210
他愿意跟我们说说吗
Does he care to enlighten us?

476
00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:24,010
你要离开多久
How long will you be gone?

477
00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:26,210
也许两晚
Maybe two nights.

478
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:27,920
最多三晚
Three at most.

479
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:32,650
你知道自己要去干什么吗
And do you know what you're getting yourself into?

480
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:34,680
达沃跟我说了一点
Davor's told me a bit about it.

481
00:37:36,390 --> 00:37:37,530
你能告诉我吗
Can you tell me?

482
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:40,130
你应该问他
You should ask him.

483
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:43,170
他一直称之为"克拉伊纳"
He always refers to it as "Krajina".

484
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:06,090
别走
Don't go.

485
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:08,810
我必须走
I have to.

486
00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:10,510
克里斯申  拜托
Christian, please.

487
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:12,130
碧昂卡  别  你就...
Bianca, don't, just...

488
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:21,250
这是什么
What's this?

489
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:22,610
假的
It's fake.

490
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:26,040
我也给你做了一本  我们可以消失
I can get one made for you too, we could disappear,

491
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:27,450
以免无法挽回
before it's too late.

492
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:32,760
我不是你想象中的人
I'm not who you think I am.

493
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:19,600
我不会放弃你  克里斯申
I won't give up on you, Christian.

494
00:39:30,150 --> 00:39:31,200
{\an2}{\pos(192,240)}你有吗

495
00:39:32,510 --> 00:39:33,670
{\an2}{\pos(192,240)}我没睡

496
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,590
{\an2}{\pos(192,240)}你有什么好担心的

497
00:39:37,590 --> 00:39:39,720
{\an2}{\pos(192,240)}我总是在想斯特凡

498
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:43,280
{\an2}{\pos(192,240)}他把我们出卖给了警察吗

499
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:44,590
{\an2}{\pos(192,240)}杂种

500
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:48,150
{\an2}{\pos(192,240)}达沃想把我赶走吗

501
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,400
{\an2}{\pos(192,240)}为什么

502
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:51,800
{\an2}{\pos(192,240)}因为  你懂的

503
00:39:52,870 --> 00:39:55,770
能扣下扳机
..you know, being able to pull the trigger?

504
00:39:59,550 --> 00:40:04,440
{\an2}{\pos(192,225)}克里斯申开枪打死了他  这对你没影响

505
00:40:06,910 --> 00:40:10,880
达沃只是开心那混蛋死了
Davor is just glad the bastard's dead.

506
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:13,680
真的
Really.

507
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:28,730
听我说  我知道之前在哪看到过那辆车了
Listen to me, I know now wh-where I've seen that car before.

508
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:31,810
对对  我可以证明  只需给我...
Yes, yes! I can prove it! Just give me my...!

509
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:55,130
比利
Billy?

510
00:41:59,190 --> 00:41:59,930
比利
Billy.

511
00:42:01,630 --> 00:42:03,090
他们就要靠岸了
They're about to dock.

512
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:08,120
那是哪里
Where is that?

513
00:42:09,990 --> 00:42:12,010
安特卫普附近
Somewhere near Antwerp.

514
00:42:27,310 --> 00:42:28,290
欢迎
Welcome.

515
00:42:35,950 --> 00:42:36,910
你想看看吗
You want to look?

516
00:42:38,870 --> 00:42:40,600
卡拉什尼科夫冲锋枪
Kalashnikov, hm?

517
00:42:46,350 --> 00:42:47,080
不好吗
No?

518
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:49,930
或许你更喜欢手枪  对吗
Maybe you prefer a handgun instead, hey?

519
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:52,050
瓦尔特PPK手枪
Walther PPK.

520
00:42:52,590 --> 00:42:53,880
希特勒就有一把
Hitler owned one.

521
00:42:54,670 --> 00:42:55,880
猫王也是
So did Elvis.

522
00:42:56,020 --> 00:42:56,850
砰
Bang!

523
00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:00,430
我们说正事吧
Shall we get down to business?

524
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:01,950
好  我们说正事
Yeah, let's get to business.

525
00:43:01,950 --> 00:43:05,480
给  别担心  这把坏了
Here, don't worry, it's broken.

526
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:06,830
看看吧
Have a look.

527
00:43:15,150 --> 00:43:16,040
你来吗
You coming?

528
00:43:20,310 --> 00:43:21,370
一切都是谎言
Everything's a lie!

529
00:43:23,030 --> 00:43:24,430
一切都是谎言
Everything's a lie!

530
00:43:26,790 --> 00:43:28,570
一切都是谎言
Everything's a lie.

531
00:43:29,470 --> 00:43:31,130
你说过  "我会告诉你
You said, "I'll tell you...

532
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:34,690
"如果有你需要知道的事"
"..if there's something you need to know."

533
00:43:38,070 --> 00:43:40,680
克拉伊纳的答案就在这里
The answer to Krajina is here.

534
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:38,840
{\an8}LAX项目  北约鲑鱼号潜艇

535
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:35,840
这是个很罕见的鸟
Quite a rare bird, this one,

536
00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:38,010
或者我该说鱼
or, should I say fish.

537
00:44:40,990 --> 00:44:43,870
这是洛索斯微型潜艇
It's a Losos Class midget submarine,

538
00:44:43,870 --> 00:44:47,730
在俄语中是"鲑鱼"的意思  如果你们想知道
translates as "salmon" in Russian, you may like to know.

539
00:44:48,070 --> 00:44:49,010
俄语
Russian?

540
00:44:49,550 --> 00:44:51,580
苏联在冷战时期很擅长建造这种
They're rather used to specialise in this type of vessel

541
00:44:51,580 --> 00:44:53,290
小型潜艇
during the Cold War.

542
00:44:53,950 --> 00:44:57,090
用途多为支持破坏任务
Designed to support sabotage missions, that sort of thing.

543
00:44:57,230 --> 00:44:59,250
它的排水量是多少
And how much can she carry?

544
00:44:59,950 --> 00:45:01,930
大概半吨吧
Up to half a metric ton, I'd say.

545
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:03,770
足够引起领地战争了
Enough to start a turf war.

546
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:05,450
天呐
Oh, my God.

547
00:45:05,790 --> 00:45:06,950
他们打算用这个
And that's what they're gonna use

548
00:45:06,950 --> 00:45:08,960
把毒品运进这个国家
to get the drugs into the country.

549
00:45:09,070 --> 00:45:10,850
你要在哪停靠这种潜艇
And where would you dock a sub like this?

550
00:45:11,190 --> 00:45:13,240
它可以在很浅的水域行进
She can operate in very shallow water.

551
00:45:13,250 --> 00:45:15,310
我想大概需要用小船
I imagine you'd probably use a small boat

552
00:45:15,310 --> 00:45:16,660
把货物送到岸上
to bring her cargo ashore.

553
00:45:16,670 --> 00:45:19,040
所以可以停在任何地方
So, anywhere, basically.

554
00:45:19,670 --> 00:45:22,510
它可以行驶几百海里
She has a range of several hundred nautical miles,

555
00:45:22,510 --> 00:45:23,770
从它的母舰上
from her mother ship.

556
00:45:24,910 --> 00:45:26,930
-母舰  -对
- Mother ship? - Yes.

557
00:45:27,390 --> 00:45:28,800
有趣的是
And funnily enough,

558
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:33,130
安特卫普周围正好有一艘符合要求的舰艇
there's one that fits the bill operating out of Antwerp right now.

559
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:36,400
亚历山大·涅夫斯基号
The Alexander Nevsky,

560
00:45:36,470 --> 00:45:39,250
苏联海军于90年代中期将其退役
decommissioned by the Russian Navy in the mid 90's,

561
00:45:39,270 --> 00:45:40,590
也许是在同一时期
probably about the same time

562
00:45:40,590 --> 00:45:44,280
狡猾的小鲑鱼也赋闲在家了
that our slippery little salmon was put out to pasture.

563
00:45:44,550 --> 00:45:47,090
它被改造为货运用船
She's been refitted as a merchant vessel.

564
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:48,200
没错
Exactly.

565
00:45:49,220 --> 00:45:52,640
只要母舰离港  你就知道
You'll know when they're going to launch our sub

566
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:54,570
他们要发射潜艇了
once she leaves the harbour.

567
00:45:54,970 --> 00:45:56,280
就是这个
This is it.
