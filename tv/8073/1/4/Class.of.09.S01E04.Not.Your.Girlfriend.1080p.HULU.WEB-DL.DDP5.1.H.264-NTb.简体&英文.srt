00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:15,010
前情提要
Previously on Class of '09...

2
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:17,720
在这里 我们会彼此握手
Out here, we shake each other's hands.

3
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:18,890
（现在）

4
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:20,550
先生 我不是来买牛的
Well, I'm not here to buy a cow, sir.

5
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:30,150
-值得吗  -他们自己暴露了
Was it worth it? They revealed themselves.

6
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:34,230
去你的
Fuck you!

7
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:39,820
-他们计画攻击的目标是什么  -我们
What are they planning to attack? Us.

8
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:45,410
我可以看清楚 你听到消息时脸上的表情
I get to see the expression on your face when you hear the news.

9
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:47,790
有些逮捕行动理由不明
There are inexplicable arrests.

10
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:48,920
（未来）

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,710
-你知 我知 -不 参议员 我不知道
You know it, I know it. No, Senator, I don't know it.

12
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:54,840
波伊特探员 你一直被蒙蔽
Special Agent Poet, you've been lied to.

13
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:57,720
这个系统会自己建立连结
This system is making connections on its own.

14
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:00,260
这是跟我们截然不同的智慧
This is an intelligence nothing like our own.

15
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:31,330
联邦凶杀案
第一季第四集

16
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:31,330
本WEB版外挂字幕由  风吹来的那片云  双语合并

17
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:45,390
（过去 1996年）

18
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:01,110
-嫌犯要进入公寓了 -收到
Suspect is entering the apartment. Copy.

19
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:16,000
嫌犯自己一个人 没看到他的女友

20
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:17,550
收到 准备进去
Copy. Moving in.

21
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:25,140
-联调局 开门 -开门
FBI. Open up. Open up!

22
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,350
手举起来 趴下 快点 趴下
Hands up! Get down! Gun! Stay on him!

23
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:35,400
我们应该待在车内
We should stay in the van.

24
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:43,320
去抓他 快点
Get off me.

25
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:47,950
可恶 放开我
Get him, let's go.

26
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:57,210
放开我
Hold him down.

27
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:00,920
联调局 不要动
FBI! Stop right there!

28
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:10,470
该死 茱儿…
Oh, shit. Drew. Drew.

29
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:13,100
她应该要待在车内的
She was supposed to stay in the van.

30
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:15,690
她为什么会在这里  她到底在这里做什么
Why was she there? What the hell was she doing?

31
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:16,770
撑着点
Hang in there.

32
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:22,490
这是我当探员的第一把手枪 西格绍尔P228
This was my weapon as an agent. A SIG Sauer p228.

33
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:28,530
你开过枪吗 长官  我是说在出任务时
Did you ever fire it, ma'am? On duty, I mean.

34
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:31,500
没有 我从未开过枪
No, I never did.

35
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,170
调查局第一把制式武器 是四吋枪管的柯特警用左轮
The Bureau's first official weapon. A four-inch barreled Colt Police revolver.

36
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:43,470
在1934年发给毕业班学员
Issued to the class of 1934 at graduation.

37
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:46,760
我们现在使用的主要武器是克拉克23
Today the primary weapon we use is the Glock 23.

38
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:49,260
这把叫做红把手
This one is called the red handle

39
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:52,890
因为枪管塞住 撞针也移除了
because the barrel has been blocked and the firing pin removed.

40
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:55,730
训练期间 你们在基地要带着这把枪
During your training, you will carry these around the base.

41
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:58,310
目的是要你们熟悉它的重量
We want you to get accustomed to the weight of them.

42
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:01,610
触感 以及概念
The feel of them. The idea of them.

43
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:03,990
长官 概念是指什么
The idea of them, ma'am?

44
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,450
取人性命意谓着什么
What it means to take a life.

45
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:09,070
冒着自己的生命危险意谓着什么
What it means to risk your life.

46
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:13,950
除非想要开枪 否则探员不会拔枪
A special agent doesn't draw their gun unless they intend to fire.

47
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:19,710
如果你觉得自己无法取人性命 那你就当不成探员
If you decide that you cannot take a life, you cannot be a special agent.

48
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,760
当你拿到武器 请跟班上同学说一下
When you receive your weapon, I'd like you to tell the class

49
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,260
自己在枪枝方面的经验
about your own experiences with firearms.

50
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,200
你对枪很熟门熟路
You know your way around a gun.

51
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,540
我成年之后就常跑靶场 长官
I spent most of my adult life in a shooting range, sir.

52
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:00,670
那是什么样的靶场
What's the story of this range?

53
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:05,170
芝加哥枪枝学院 长官 由一对和善的越南夫妇所经营
Chicago Gun Academy, sir. Ran by a lovely Vietnamese couple.

54
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,720
去那里的人不是想要拿枪射谁
The people going there weren't dreaming of shooting anybody,

55
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,260
他们只是不想被人开枪
they just didn't want to be shot.

56
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,730
这是我第一次拿枪
This is the first time I've ever held a gun.

57
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:22,020
你何时提出申请的
When did you apply?

58
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,570
六个月前
Six months ago.

59
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:29,450
如果你们不接受 我说出来也没什么意义
There wasn't any point in telling you if I wasn't going to be accepted.

60
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:34,620
你没有告诉我们 是因为你知道我们会说不
You didn't tell us because you knew we'd say no.

61
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:37,410
为什么现在要告诉我们
Why tell us now?

62
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:42,630
下一阶段是测谎 如果我没有告诉你们
The next stage is the polygraph. So if I hadn't told you...

63
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:48,840
-那可能会出现在我的答案里 -乌尔 你在做什么
maybe it would show up in my answers. Hour. What are you doing?

64
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:52,890
-你有麻省理工的学位 -他们喜欢我这点
You have a degree from MIT. They like that about me.

65
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:56,220
因为没有其他人 会这样浪费自己的教育背景
Because nobody else would waste their education in this way.

66
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,390
这是你一无所知的世界
This is not a world you know anything about.

67
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,770
我们搭地铁上班 这样才不会在开车时被拦下来
We take the Metro to work so we won't be stopped in our car.

68
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:06,440
我们度假时是搭车 这样才不会在机场被拦下来
We take the car on vacation so we won't be stopped at the airports.

69
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:08,280
我不想要这样的生活
I don't want to live that way.

70
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:12,110
-我想要有归属感 -这是你选择的生活
I want to feel part of something. And this is what you choose?

71
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:15,700
-他们需要我 爸 -但你为什么需要他们
They want me, Dad. But why do you want them?

72
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:18,910
他们会叫你做什么
What will they have you do?

73
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:22,580
-监视自己的同胞  -爸爸 这又不是秘密警察
Spy on your own people? Baba, this isn't the secret police.

74
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,960
他们一定会对我们家进行背景调查
They must have carried out a background check on our family.

75
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:29,590
-你把他们带进了我们的生活 -我们没什么好隐瞒的
You've brought them into our lives. We have nothing to hide.

76
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:33,010
那不是重点 那从来就不是重点
That doesn't matter. That has never mattered.

77
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:40,600
你在生我们的气吗
Are you angry with us?

78
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:43,400
这是跟…
Is this about...

79
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,610
-其他事情有关吗  -那会是什么 妈妈
something else? What might it be about, Mom?

80
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:47,820
你是…
You were...

81
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:51,030
孤独的孩子
a lonely child.

82
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:53,360
或许你现在还是很孤独
Perhaps you're lonely still.

83
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:55,070
或许我会一直孤独下去
Maybe I'll always be lonely.

84
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,700
想要在这个国家有归属感有其他方法
There are other ways to feel a part of this country.

85
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,830
想要跟我们有不同感受也有其他方法
And other ways to feel different from us.

86
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:08,840
希望你们以我为荣 是不是太过奢求了
Was it too much to hope that you'd be proud of me?

87
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:31,820
请抬起手臂
Would you lift your arms, please?

88
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,740
-我可以自己来 -不行 得由我来
- I can do that. - No, it has to be me.

89
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,040
请把手摊平
Will you lay your hands flat, please?

90
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,130
可以解释一下你正在做什么吗
Could you explain what you're doing?

91
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:50,550
从来没有人问过
Nobody ever asks that.

92
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:54,590
椅子上有侦测动作的感测器
There's a sensor in the chair that detects movement.

93
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:58,430
这些是测量你呼吸频率的列线图管
These are pneumography tubes, measure your rate of respiration.

94
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:02,020
这些会测量你的肤电活动 那个会量血压
These measure electrodermal activity. That's for your blood pressure.

95
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,520
测试大概要花两个小时
The test will take approximately two hours.

96
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:09,770
如果你的答案没有反应 可能会花上四小时
And if your answers are unresponsive, it can take up to four.

97
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:12,230
你的答案只能局限在是与否
You have to limit your answers to yes or no.

98
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:15,860
你随时可以终止测试 但这样做会造成失败
You can stop the test at any time, but to do so would constitute a fail.

99
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:18,910
你有权找律师 但这么做会…
And you have the right to an attorney, but to call for one would...

100
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:20,200
造成失败
Constitute a fail.

101
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,450
会紧张是正常的
It's normal to be nervous.

102
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:27,500
我不紧张 我是好奇
I'm not nervous. I'm curious.

103
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:35,300
-谁来解读这些反应  -我
Who interprets the responses? I do.

104
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:38,510
-你做过多少测试  -几百次
How many tests have you done? Oh, hundreds.

105
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:44,390
每年有五万人申请加入联邦调查局
There are 50,000 applicants to the Bureau each year.

106
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:48,100
政府一定执行了几百万次这样的测试
The government must have carried out millions of these tests.

107
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,650
-经年累月 -你们会…
Over the years. Do you...

108
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:53,320
搜集资料吗
collect the data?

109
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:55,690
我们会以档案形式保存
We keep 'em on file.

110
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:59,570
-是存放在集中式资料库吗  -不是
But is it on a centralized database? No.

111
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:04,450
这些资料如果能交叉比对
Doesn't it make sense to cross-reference them

112
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:07,000
而非依赖单一个人的解读 不是更合理吗
rather than rely on one person's interpretation?

113
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:11,920
之前不是有李文和的案子 那个洛沙拉摩斯的核子科学家
There was the case of Wen Ho Lee. Nuclear scientist at Los Alamos

114
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,210
-他被控当中国的间谍 -我知道这个案子
accused of being a Chinese spy? I know the case.

115
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:18,550
他通过了能源部的测谎 但是当联调局重新检视同一份结果
He passed the DOE polygraph. But the FBI reexamined the same results

116
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,430
他们判定他在说谎
and they decided he was lying.

117
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:24,100
他把W88小型核弹头的秘密 泄漏给中国
That he had slipped China secrets about the miniaturized W88 warhead.

118
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:28,640
如果你们把搜集到的资料 都放到集中式资料库
Maybe if you collated all the data on a central database,

119
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:30,020
或许判读就不会那么主观了
it wouldn't be so subjective.

120
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:38,030
你知道 有些人不想要通过测试
You know, some people want to fail a test.

121
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:41,660
他们会故意采取某种方式 让自己退出流程
They deliberately flunk it in a way to drop out of the process

122
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:45,120
却又不会丢脸 如果你是这种情况 尽管说
without losing face. If that's you, just say so.

123
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,210
可以开始了吗
Can we begin?

124
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:06,850
（现在 2023年）

125
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:43,680
真遗憾先前没有握手
Excuse me for not shaking your hand.

126
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:04,990
-一名海军陆战队员曾经跟我说… -抱歉 这名海军陆战队员
Marine once told me... I'm sorry, this Marine,

127
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:06,740
是你的朋友还是…
is he a friend of yours, or...?

128
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,710
朋友 好朋友 爱国者
Friend. Close friend. Patriot.

129
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:16,710
他说一个人在第一次杀人之后
He said after a man kills for the first time,

130
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:18,880
他的皮肤味道会改变
the smell of his skin changes.

131
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:21,340
你的妻子
Your wife.

132
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:24,050
她是你杀的第一个人吗
Was she the first person you've killed?

133
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:28,050
我把她从破烂的地方救出来
Well, I rescued her from squalor.

134
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:31,520
修补她的牙齿 整理她的头发
I fixed her teeth, her hair.

135
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:34,350
照顾她生存的一切所需
Overlooked everything she had to do to survive.

136
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,100
听起来你照顾过头了
Yeah, sounds like you overlooked quite a bit

137
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:37,980
因为你看不出来她恨你
because you couldn't see that she hated you.

138
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:40,900
那你的太太呢
What about your wife?

139
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:44,570
看起来我让你们两个人都成了凶手
Looks like I made killers of you both.

140
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:47,820
我认为可以肯定地说 我们有正当理由 不是吗
I think it's safe to say that we had just cause, wouldn't you?

141
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,580
“正当理由”
Just cause?

142
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:53,790
“正当理由”
Just cause.

143
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:58,420
你跑到我的牧场就是想要找这个吗
Is that what you were looking for out at my ranch?

144
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:02,510
“正当理由” 你一辈子都在找正当理由
"Just cause." Yeah, you've been looking for that your whole life.

145
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:05,840
你有了徽章和枪
And you got your badge and your gun.

146
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:10,310
现在只需要“正当理由” 就可以为所欲为
All you needed was that "just cause" to get away with it.

147
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:15,890
为所欲为 是啊
"To get away with it," yeah.

148
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:20,110
我们来谈谈“为所欲为”
Let's talk about that, "getting away with it."

149
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:24,400
因为如果能为所欲为 我会去乱逛你的牧场
Because getting away with it, I would've just strolled on your ranch.

150
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:27,320
我会一枪打中你眉心
And I would've shot you right between the eyes.

151
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:31,530
也许我应该这么做 因为如此一来你太太就不会丧命
And maybe I should've because then... your wife would still be alive.

152
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,240
我的搭档不会躺在医院床上
My partner wouldn't be lying in a hospital bed.

153
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:36,500
我太太也不会遭受攻击 但我没有
And my wife wouldn't have been attacked. But I didn't.

154
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,460
不…我没有
No, no, no, I didn't.

155
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:46,720
你是蒙大拿阶级最高的联调局探员
You're the highest ranking FBI agent in Montana.

156
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:49,510
如果不是猎捕像我这样的人 你在例行的外勤工作当中
What you doing on a routine piece of fieldwork

157
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:51,600
还能做什么
if not hunting for folks like me?

158
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:55,430
没错 你已经梦想这天好几年了
Yeah, you've been dreaming of that day for years.

159
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:02,150
让我们把事情说清楚
Let's... Let's be very clear about something.

160
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:04,980
你可能有很多身分
You may be many things,

161
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:08,070
但你绝对不是我的梦想
but you are no dream of mine.

162
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:12,330
我们搞清楚了他们被逮时
Have we figured out where they were driving to

163
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:15,620
-正要开车去哪里吗  -我们无法理解他们的路线
when they were caught? We can't make sense of their route.

164
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:18,370
（计算可能目的地）

165
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:20,000
有没有可能他们在声东击西
Is it possible that they were a diversion?

166
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,290
为了避开什么
A diversion from what?

167
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:37,390
表现不错 乌尔 你是天生好手
Nice job, Hour. You're a natural.

168
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:39,270
泰约 换你了
Tayo, you're up.

169
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:41,230
表现得很好…
Nice job.

170
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:44,360
射手准备
Shooter, stand by.

171
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:04,000
好枪法 学员
Nice shooting, trainee.

172
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,850
射手 准备
Shooter, stand by.

173
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:45,210
你为什么僵住了 学员
Why did you freeze, trainee?

174
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:47,250
不 我没有僵住
Ma'am, I didn't freeze.

175
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:49,840
你没开枪
You didn't fire.

176
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:53,550
-我不认为她是威胁 -为什么 她手拿武器
I didn't consider her to be a threat. Why not? She's armed.

177
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:57,100
但她是谁呢 她是一名女性 看起来是专业人士
But who is she? She's a woman, she looks like a professional,

178
00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:00,730
-我猜她是执法人员 -她拿的不是克拉克
my guess would be law enforcement. She's not holding a Glock.

179
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:04,600
史密斯威森640 是下班警察可合法配戴的枪
Smith & Wesson 640. Approved for off-duty police officers.

180
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:08,070
所以你在那电光火石之间 判断她是下班的警探
So you decided in that split second she was an off-duty detective?

181
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,570
他们也用那些枪来保护自己
Well, they also use those guns for personal protection.

182
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:12,400
她可能是要逃离有暴力倾向的伙伴
She could be escaping a violent partner.

183
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:15,280
这项测试不是要帮她写传记
The test wasn't to write her biography.

184
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:19,370
但我们不用吗  如果我们要取她性命的话
But don't we have to, if we're gonna take her life?

185
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,720
-嘿 -嘿
- Hey. - Hey.

186
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:36,430
刚刚我很为你感到骄傲
I was proud of you back there.

187
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:38,970
你觉得骄傲
You were proud?

188
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:42,770
-我说错话了 对吧  -没有
Oh, I said the wrong word, didn't I? No.

189
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:46,440
不管正确的字眼是什么 那是我当时的感受
Well, whatever the, uh, the right word is, that is how I felt.

190
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:49,400
正确的字眼不是你说了算吗
Isn't it up to you to decide what the right word is?

191
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:53,650
-你很难恭维 -而且很容易得罪
You're a hard person to compliment. And an easy one to offend?

192
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:54,780
我没那么说
I didn't say that.

193
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,530
你在哪里学会开枪的
Where'd you learn how to shoot?

194
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:01,490
我妈 在后院打锡罐
My mom. Tin cans in the backyard.

195
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:05,670
她认为任何独居的女性 都应该知道怎么开枪
She believed any woman who lived alone should know how to shoot.

196
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,420
-你呢  -我爸…
- You? - My dad.

197
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:10,380
猎鹿
Hunting deer.

198
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,770
我在做什么
What am I doing?

199
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:31,270
我应该要工作 而不是去约会
I'm supposed to be working, not going on dates.

200
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,320
-这是心有旁骛 -坠入爱河不是心有旁骛
He's a distraction. Falling in love is not a distraction.

201
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:36,740
我没有坠入爱河
I'm not in love.

202
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:42,370
接下来五个月会决定我们的下半辈子
I mean, these next five months decide the rest of our lives.

203
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:44,910
任何五个月都会决定我们的下半辈子
Any five months decide the rest of our lives.

204
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
有些月份就是比较重要
Well, some months are more important than others.

205
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:53,420
中学时我有朋友都在胡搞瞎搞 现在
I had friends in high school who...

206
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:56,420
他们有的是时间 但就是无法改变自己的人生
messed around and now they have all the time in the world, but they can't change their lives.

207
00:16:57,430 --> 00:17:00,470
我知道那种感觉 那是内疚
I know these feelings. It's guilt.

208
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:04,390
我爱上某个人时 也会有这种感觉
I felt the same way when I'd fall for someone.

209
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:07,560
我没有爱上他 我只是…喜欢他
I haven't fallen for him, I just... I like him.

210
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,060
对我来说 内疚就是…
For me the guilt is...

211
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:16,690
因为我没有结婚 对你来说 就是职业道德
...because I'm not married. For you it's work ethic.

212
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,240
你知道吗…
Yeah.

213
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:25,870
我妈从来没有跟任何人约会过
My mom never dated anyone.

214
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:31,580
我爸离家出走时 她答应我绝不会带男朋友回家
When my dad... walked out, she promised me she'd never bring a boyfriend home.

215
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:35,130
我一直都没有父亲 所以 她要弥补这一点
I never had a father, so she was gonna make up for that.

216
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:38,130
但是当我年纪渐长…
But when I got older, you know, and...

217
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:41,970
并意识到这让她付出了什么代价 我应该要说
and realized what this was costing her, I-I should have said...

218
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,640
“没关系的 你可以去约会
"It's fine, you can date.

219
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,890
你不必是孤单一人”
You don't have to be alone."

220
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,650
也许如果我…
Maybe if I had...

221
00:17:56,610 --> 00:18:00,860
没关系的 你可以去约会 你不必是孤单孤单一人
It's fine. You can date. You don't have to be alone.

222
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:19,340
-你可以跟我来吗  -是 长官
Can you come with me, please? Yes, ma'am.

223
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:42,660
在训练的这个阶段 我们会再次进行测谎
At this point in the training, we repeat your polygraph test

224
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:44,240
然后比较两次的反应
and compare your responses.

225
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:47,870
只有我吗
Only me?

226
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:50,200
为什么会只有你
Why would it only be you?

227
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:53,750
好的
Right.

228
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:34,870
想办法放松 我不想要你因为紧张而没过关
Try to relax. I'd hate to fail you because you couldn't relax.

229
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:43,970
你是否服用过任何非法毒品
Have you ever taken any illegal narcotics?

230
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:45,890
是
Yes.

231
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:51,970
你在申请表里填了你曾吸过几次大麻
You listed on your application the occasions you smoked marijuana.

232
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:54,730
-现在还是只有那几次吗  -是
Are these still the only occasions? Yes.

233
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,770
是在做爱之后抽的吗
Were they after sex?

234
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:01,940
否
No.

235
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:05,530
令堂曾经对处方药上瘾吗
Was your mother ever addicted to prescription medication?

236
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,240
是
Yes.

237
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:12,750
你曾经对处方药上瘾吗
Have you ever been addicted to prescription medication?

238
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:15,540
否
No.

239
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:19,340
在这个过程中 你是否隐瞒了任何
You concealed anything during this process

240
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:21,920
可能会对你的申请 造成负面影响的事情
which might negatively influence your application?

241
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,680
是
Yes.

242
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:34,560
你先前的答案是“否” 你现在要把它改成“是”
Your previous answer was no. You're changing your answer to yes?

243
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:35,850
是
Yes.

244
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:41,110
-你先前说谎吗  -否
Did you lie before? No.

245
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,860
所以是新发生的事
This is something new?

246
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:48,030
是
Yes.

247
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,410
下一个问题 你可以不用
For the next question, I'm going to release you

248
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:56,080
只回答“是”与“否”
of the obligation saying yes or no.

249
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:59,040
你隐瞒了什么事
What have you concealed?

250
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:12,350
你重新接受过测谎了吗
Have you retaken the polygraph?

251
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,640
上个星期
Last week.

252
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:18,190
-是吗 结果如何  -一样
Oh, yeah? How'd it go? The same.

253
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:23,320
你什么话也不跟我说
You didn't say something to me?

254
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:25,940
要说什么
What's to say?

255
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,650
你有把我们的事情告诉他们吗
Did you tell them about us?

256
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:32,780
我们的事 没有 你有吗
About us? No. Did you?

257
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:37,910
他们问我有没有隐瞒任何事
I mean... they asked me if I was concealing anything.

258
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,120
那不是在说我们
They weren't talking about us.

259
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:41,210
你怎么知道 这违反规定
How do you know? This is against the rules.

260
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:44,380
-什么规定  -联邦调查局学员守则
What rules? The agent trainee rules.

261
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:49,260
-你真的读了那种东西  -拜托 这很重要
You actually read those? Come on. This is important.

262
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,930
这里又不是中学
This isn't high school.

263
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,890
所以你觉得 我们不需要让盖布瑞和茱儿知道
So you don't think we need to let Gabriel and Drew know?

264
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:58,480
-不关他们的事 -每件事都关他们的事
It's none of their business. Everything is their business.

265
00:21:58,980 --> 00:21:59,980
我们的不是
Not us.

266
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:14,740
-介意我跟你一起走吗  -当然不
Mind if I walk with you? Oh, of course not.

267
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:17,910
我想要谈谈你的测谎
I wanted to talk about your polygraph.

268
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:19,830
我没通过吗
Oh, did I fail?

269
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:24,500
听着 我现在不是 以指导者的身分讲话
Look, I'm not speaking as your supervisor right now.

270
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:26,800
好
Okay.

271
00:22:27,170 --> 00:22:30,840
自从女性获准加入调查局以来 就一直有绯闻或情侣产生
Ever since women were allowed to join, there have been hookups and couples.

272
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:35,350
有些人到后来甚至还结了婚 但多数人没有
Some even end up getting married. Most don't.

273
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,270
我不想让你感到尴尬
I'm not trying to embarrass you.

274
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:43,310
只是想让你察觉我们处境的现实面
I just wanted you to be aware of the reality of our situation.

275
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,520
你是指
Which is...?

276
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:48,900
如果不顺利 情况变得糟糕的总是女性
If it doesn't work out, the woman always comes off worse.

277
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,070
遭受打击的总是女性
She always takes the hit.

278
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:54,120
不应该是这样 但现实就是如此
It shouldn't be that way. But it is.

279
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:57,620
我不是要叫你采取不同的作法
And I'm not telling you to do anything differently.

280
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,620
我只是要告诉你 事情就是这样
I'm telling you the way it is.

281
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,330
我很感激
I appreciate that.

282
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:07,670
初入职场时 我涉入一起事件 变成了被指责的对象
I was in an incident at the beginning of my career, for which I was blamed.

283
00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:12,090
那是一起探员对探员的枪击事件
It was an agent-on-agent shooting.

284
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:16,140
-你开枪打探员  -不是 我是挨子弹的那个人
- You shot an agent? - No. I was the one who was shot.

285
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:20,270
-你说被怪罪的人是你  -没错
You said you were blamed? I was.

286
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:24,770
他们提出的原因是说我在错误的位置
One of the reasons they gave was they said I was in the wrong place.

287
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:27,360
但我在的位置跟男性一模一样
And I was in the same place as the guys.

288
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:29,530
真遗憾
I'm so sorry.

289
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:33,320
要不是对方的枪法太差 我早就没命了
Ah, I'd be dead if they weren't such lousy shots.

290
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:40,660
-你为什么还留在局里  -我不能让他们赢
Why did you stay in the Bureau? I couldn't let 'em win.

291
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:43,410
我是当年度最佳学员
I was one of the best trainees my year.

292
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:46,380
当我康复 我就回到了教室
So, when I recovered, I just came back to the classroom.

293
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:51,010
因为…这里是唯一 能让我有所成就的地方
'Cause... that's the only place I was ever allowed to be great.

294
00:23:58,930 --> 00:24:05,350
（未来 2034年）

295
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:29,710
你好
Hey.

296
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:31,460
你好
Hey.

297
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:36,340
我可以进去吗
Can I come in?

298
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,520
房子很大
Big house.

299
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:49,020
对 有女孩子在的时候 感觉不错
Yeah, it's nice when the girls stay.

300
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:53,070
那样的情况有多频繁
How often is that?

301
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,950
不如我想要的那么频繁
Not as often as I'd like.

302
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,280
真遗憾
I'm sorry.

303
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:04,370
是啊 我也觉得
Yeah, so am I.

304
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:15,300
我依靠家庭关系想要了解…
I leaned on my family connections to try and see if...

305
00:25:16,170 --> 00:25:17,720
谁是盟友
you know, who was an ally.

306
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:21,260
很多人…
A lot of people are...

307
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,680
真的很担心这套系统
really worried about this system.

308
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:27,060
他们认为它太庞大 也太强大
Uh, they think it's too big, it's too powerful.

309
00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:31,440
很多人只会在私底下表达担忧
A lot of people will only express their concerns in private.

310
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,820
没有太多人愿意帮忙
Not a lot are willing to help.

311
00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:39,030
-不令人讶异 对吧  -对
No surprise there, right? No.

312
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:44,740
光是谈论就可能让人惹上麻烦
Even talking can get people in trouble.

313
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,410
有些人因为我接近他们而感到生气
Some got mad at me for approaching them

314
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:52,330
-面对面 远离摄影机 -你爸有帮助吗
face-to-face, away from cameras. Is your dad helping?

315
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:58,970
他认识人面广的人 其中包括史宾塞参议员
He knows people that know people, including Senator Spenser,

316
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:01,930
所以 我正在设法安排会面
so I'm trying to... set up a meeting.

317
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:04,930
但就像我说的 人们很害怕
But like I said, people are scared.

318
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:16,690
我想说的是 在这件事…
I wanted to say that... you know, before this goes too far,

319
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:20,990
变得不可收拾之前 你不必为了我而一起调查
you don't have to be a part of the investigation into Tayo's system

320
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:24,740
-泰约的系统 -诗人 别这样
for my sake. Poet, stop.

321
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:28,910
-你可以自己进行 我懂 -你…
You can do it on your own. I-I get it. You...

322
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:34,750
你总是认为我喜欢自己一个人
You always had it in your mind that I preferred to be alone.

323
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,130
因为你一向如此
Because you always are.

324
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:41,630
不是我的话也没关系
If not me, okay.

325
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:44,600
但至少要有别人
But someone.

326
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,480
我…
Am...

327
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,690
我是问题吗
Am I the problem?

328
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:02,990
每次感觉不错时 你总是不相信 好像那不会是真的一样
Every time something feels good, you mistrust it. Like it can't be real.

329
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:07,080
你会不断测试 直到它崩坏
So you test it and you test it until it breaks.

330
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:11,910
然后你会对自己说 “看吧 我一直都是对的”
And you say to yourself, "You see? I was right all along."

331
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:16,590
这是我们之间没有成功的原因吗
Is that why we didn't make it?

332
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:24,760
或许我生命中的每件事 看起来都很轻松
Maybe everything in my life seemed too easy.

333
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:28,720
而你不想要成为其中一件事
And you wouldn't be another one of those things.

334
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:32,850
但我现在可以跟你说…
But I can tell you now...

335
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,150
爱上你并不轻松
loving you has not been easy.

336
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:39,940
而我已经爱你二十年了
And I've loved you for 20 years.

337
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:50,200
这就是为什么你不应该牵扯进这件事
That is why you should not be involved in this.

338
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:52,710
诗人 这次不行
Not this time, Poet.

339
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:58,000
这次你必须告诉我毫无机会
This time, you're gonna have to tell me it doesn't stand a chance.

340
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:02,630
这次不会是我
This time, it's not gonna be me.

341
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:09,450
图皮瑞克能让人渗透进局里吗
Could Tupirik have people infiltrate the Bureau?

342
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:11,660
为什么不呢
Why not?

343
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,370
-一直都有查核 -测谎吗
There are checks. The polygraph?

344
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:19,630
我测谎时就说谎了
I lied on mine.

345
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:23,630
你对什么事说谎
What'd you lie about?

346
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,680
只有真正重要的事
Only the really important things.

347
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:34,520
几个州发起了至少十几次的搜索行动
At least a dozen manhunts

348
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,690
想要逮捕马克图皮瑞克 民兵组织的其他主要成员
for additional key members of Mark Tupirik's militia are underway in multiple states...

349
00:29:37,850 --> 00:29:40,770
目前调查局正试图厘清
as the Bureau attempts to figure out the scope

350
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:43,070
反政府民兵运动的范围与规模
and scale of his anti-government militia.

351
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:45,690
枪枝射击评鉴就在今天
Firearms assessment is today.

352
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:03,710
你有吗
You got it?

353
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:13,800
谢谢
Thanks.

354
00:30:43,130 --> 00:30:44,460
我们今天行动
We go today.

355
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:55,350
我要你看一下萤幕上的这些人
at the people on this screen.

356
00:31:13,570 --> 00:31:14,570
你在怕什么
What are you afraid of?

357
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,620
你认为自己很容易就会被…
You think you'll be too easy to read?

358
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:25,040
像我这样的人看穿
By a man like me?

359
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:37,140
系统发现情绪紧张的动作
The system is picking up elevated movements,

360
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:39,140
瞳孔放大 心跳加快
pupil dilation, heart rate increase.

361
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:41,520
我们找到人了
We've got one.

362
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:48,020
下一位
Next.

363
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:02,450
我以前见过这个人
I've seen this man before.

364
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:05,460
在车库里施工
Doing construction in the garage.

365
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:09,420
我们认为嫌犯可能就在宽提科
We think the suspect may be at Quantico.

366
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:16,970
听令 一边向前走 一边射击目标
On the signal, walk forward while shooting at the target.

367
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:23,890
有人开枪…
Shooter! Shooter!

368
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,730
-嘿 -快逃
Hey!

369
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:47,620
拜托
No, please!

370
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:14,860
-她流了好多血 -干得好
She's losing so much blood. You're gonna be all right.

371
00:33:15,990 --> 00:33:17,450
宽提科有警报
There's an alert at Quantico.

372
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:31,590
-我想请你立刻跟我碰面 -在哪里 这里吗
Hey. I need you to meet me right now. Where? Here?

373
00:33:31,670 --> 00:33:34,380
如果我错了 我来承担 但我们必须疏散这栋大楼
I'll take the heat if I'm wrong, but we need to evacuate this building.

374
00:33:35,710 --> 00:33:36,880
好了 我们走吧

375
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:50,480
注意…请立刻撤离这栋建筑物
Attention, attention. Please evacuate this building immediately.

376
00:33:50,690 --> 00:33:51,860
这不是演习
This is not a drill.

377
00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:57,860
注意…请立刻撤离这栋建筑物
Attention. Attention. Please evacuate this building immediately.

378
00:33:58,150 --> 00:33:59,400
这不是演习
This is not a drill.

379
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:06,500
注意…请立刻撤离这栋建筑物
Attention. Attention. Please evacuate this building immediately.

380
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:08,080
这不是演习
This is not a drill.

381
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:23,510
嘿
Hey!

382
00:35:05,890 --> 00:35:07,680
好了 换下一根柱子

383
00:35:10,810 --> 00:35:12,100
嘿 不要动
Hey, freeze!

384
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:19,610
放轻松…我只是要去找我的主管
Easy. Easy. I just got to go get my supervisor.

385
00:35:40,010 --> 00:35:43,590
注意…请立刻撤离这栋建筑物
Hurry! Please evacuate this building immediately.

386

387
00:35:49,810 --> 00:35:51,480
疏散…

388
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:25,550
我们必须离开 现在就走
We have to go! We have to go now!
