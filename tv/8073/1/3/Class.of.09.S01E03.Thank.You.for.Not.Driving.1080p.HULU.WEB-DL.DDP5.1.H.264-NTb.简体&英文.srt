1
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:14,270
前情提要
Previously on Class of '09...

2
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:15,400
（过去）

3
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:17,480
泰约 你自己测试过吗
Tayo, did you self-test?

4
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:20,650
-报告长官 有 -你通过了
Yes, sir, I did. And you passed?

5
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:23,990
-是的 长官 -但你在这里没有通过测验
Yes, ma'am. Well, you haven't passed it here.

6
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:26,530
我不在乎你们喜不喜欢对方
I don't care whether you like each other or not.

7
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:28,620
当你受到攻击时
These are the people who'll be by your side

8
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:30,950
-这些人会在你身边 -现在他们在监视我
when you're under fire. Now they're watching me.

9
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:32,540
（未来）

10
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:34,250
你应该跟乌尔谈谈 只有她
You should talk to Hour. She's the only one

11
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:35,830
了解那些程式码
who ever understood the code.

12
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,010
（现在）

13
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:41,380
-你们来访的目的是  -我们只是
Why are you here? We were just

14
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:42,970
希望能聊一聊
hoping that we could talk a bit.

15
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:49,560
我看到报导 胡佛局长会流放 他不喜欢的探员到标特和比林斯员
I read that J. Edgar Hoover used to exile out-of-favor agents to Butte and Billings.

16
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:51,640
麦可斯探员 你犯了什么错吗
Did you do something wrong, Agent Michaels?

17
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:11,580
地下室
The basement.

18
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:24,550
（妻子）

19
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:38,610
我们阻止了对方的行动
Did we stop something?

20
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:43,190
还是启动了
Or start it?

21
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:55,750
如果你怕了 尽管举手 我就会停车
If you get scared, just raise your hand and I'll stop.

22
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:13,520
汽车和联邦调查局一起成长
The car and the Bureau grew up together.

23
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:17,100
调查局成立于1908年
The Bureau Of Investigation was founded in 1908.

24
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:20,440
同一年 亨利福特开始在底特律
That same year, Henry Ford began mass production

25
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:24,360
皮凯特大道工厂大量生产T型车
of the Model T automobile at the Piquette Avenue Plant in Detroit.

26
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:28,280
有史以来第一次 一般的美国家庭
For the first time ordinary American families

27
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:29,700
买得起自己的车子
could afford their own car.

28
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:33,950
有史以来第一次 一般的美国罪犯也买得起车了
For the first time ordinary American criminals could, too.

29
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:38,290
没有汽车 本局会变成怎样
What would the Bureau have become without the car?

30
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,960
它会有任何的变化吗
Would it have become anything at all?

31
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:47,550
赛道已清空 可进行高速转向操驾
AGENT (over P.A.): Track is clear for spin maneuver.

32
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:51,260
好 我出发了
Okay. Here we go.

33
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:06,280
你太紧绷了
You're too high-strung.

34
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:15,080
加油
Come on, come on.

35
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,870
你很拼 这样很好
You've got some fight. I like that.

36
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,330
但要倒车甩尾直行 你必须让车子有点失控
But to do a J-turn, you've got to lose control.

37
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:38,930
太好了
Yes!

38
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,020
很好
Yeah!

39
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,550
联邦凶杀案
第一季第三集

40
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,550
本WEB版外挂字幕由  风吹来的那片云  双语合并

41
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:25,770
好好监视 盯住那些窗户
We've got line of sight on both sides of the building.

42
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:30,570
（现在 2023年）

43
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:33,280
他在图皮瑞克的牧场 我们包围住他了
He was at Two Bricks Ranch. We've got him surrounded.

44
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:35,370
他想要谈判
He wants to negotiate.

45
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:38,330
破门小队 现在就位
Breach team, moving into position now.

46
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:51,090
就位
Positions!

47
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:09,400
AB两队已就位
Alpha, Bravo Team's in position.

48
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,650
不要开枪 嘿
No one fire. Hey!

49
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:14,280
注意 牛仔走进去了
Heads up, got one walking in.

50
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:18,280
-走到栏杆旁 -收到

51
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,790
联调局 把手举起来
FBI! Keep your hands in the air!

52
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,170
马克图皮瑞克在哪里
Where is Mark Tupirik?

53
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,300
你根本不了解接下来会发生什么事
You got no idea what's coming.

54
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:44,770
（未来 2034年）

55
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:50,320
（电子讯号阻断器）

56
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:54,440

Warning. Magnetic interference detected.

58
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,040
（警告 侦测到磁…）
Warning. Magnetic interference detected.

59
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:23,580
妈妈
Mama!

60
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,870
我想要你见见我的家人
I want you to meet my family.

61
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:39,220
你们好 我是波伊特
Hi, I'm Poet.

62
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:41,680
我知道你是谁
I know who you are.

63
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:45,810
-她是莎拉 -你好
This is Sara. Hello there.

64
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:48,180
你为什么看起来这么悲伤
Why do you look so sad?

65
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,020
我不悲伤 我很开心
I-I'm not sad. I'm happy.

66
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:55,520
你是我妈的朋友吗
Are you my mom's friend?

67
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:00,700
她是我最好的朋友
She was my best friend.

68
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:12,370
我需要你的帮忙
I need your help.

69
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:14,750
我的帮忙
My help?

70
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,050
你是对的
You were right.

71
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:19,760
-我错了 -错在哪里
I was wrong. What were you wrong about?

72
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:20,880
全部
All of it.

73
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,640
他们偷了你的系统 把它变成了可怕的东西
They stole your system. They turned it into something terrible.

74
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,220
我告诉过你会发生这种事
I told you this would happen.

75
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:27,970
我别无选择 由不得我决定
I didn't have a choice. It wasn't my call--

76
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:29,470
你有选择 你可以相信我
You did have a choice. You could've trusted me.

77
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:34,020
再也不是预测了 它已成真 现在正在发生
It's not a prediction anymore. Okay? It's reality. It's happening now.

78
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:35,480
发生了什么事
What is happening?

79
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,490
-阿莫斯贾西亚死了 -很好
- Amos Garcia is dead. - Good!

80
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:45,450
让他腐烂 他偷了我的系统 你站在他那一边
Let him rot. He stole my fucking system. You sided with him.

81
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:52,830
他中枪时我在场 他给了我一样东西
I was there when he was shot. He gave me something.

82
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:57,960
我需要你帮忙解读
Something that I need your help understanding.

83
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:05,010
这个系统已经扩展到 我们生活的每个层面
The system has expanded into every part of our lives.

84
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,720
先前我恳求你帮我
I begged you to help me.

85
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:09,930
我从来没有求过你任何事
I've never asked you for anything.

86
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:13,310
当我恳求你 你却转身拒绝我
And I begged you. And you turned your back on me.

87
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:22,440
我了解你 诗人 我知道在我对你告白之后
I know you, Poet. I know it would've been too intimate for you if...

88
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:28,410
如果你还站在我这边的话 对你来说会太过亲密
...if you had sided with me after I told you that I was in love with you.

89
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:43,720
这个嘛…
Well...

90
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:46,590
就是这样了
here we are.

91
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,270
我来到这里
Here I am.

92
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:55,350
蒙羞 独自一人
Humiliated, alone.

93
00:09:56,850 --> 00:10:00,690
我失去调查局 我失去最好的朋友 我无法改变这些事
I lost the Bureau, I lost my best friend. And I can't change any of it,

94
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:04,690
但我可以试 我可以试着弥补错误
but I can try. I can try and make this right.

95
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:39,310
（现在）

96
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:03,960
我们称它为“更好的明天”
We call it "Better Tomorrow."

97
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:13,510
在你看来 更好的明天是什么样子
What does a better tomorrow look like to you?

98
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,060
那是一个坏事都不会被遗漏
It's a world where nothing bad gets missed.

99
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,190
证据都不会被忽视的世界
And no piece of evidence is ever overlooked.

100
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:22,060
听起来很不错
I like the sound of that.

101
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:25,940
你不觉得20年后 他们会在我们变得正聪明的时候
Don't you think it's crazy that after 20 years,

102
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:28,070
把我们踢出去 这样很蠢吗
they kick us out just as we're getting smart?

103
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:31,280
-对 会啊 -我们一直致力于学习
Yeah, I do. All that time we devote to learning.

104
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:35,200
现在 如果所有的人生经验 所有的智慧
Now what if all that life experience, all that wisdom,

105
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:37,160
都保留在这里呢
was held here?

106
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:40,750
你是这么看的吗
That's how you see this?

107
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:45,380
当本局在调查大学航空炸弹客的案子
When the Bureau was investigating the Unabomber case,

108
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:48,840
他们引进了 z索引电脑系统 你记得吗
they introduced the Z Index computer system. Do you remember that?

109
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:51,680
没有人记得z索引系统
Nobody remembers the Z Index system.

110
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,140
那是调查局最早使用的电脑系统
It was one of the first computer systems the Bureau ever used.

111
00:11:56,350 --> 00:12:01,190
保留了1100万份大学航空炸弹客文件 8400万个人名
Held all 11 million Unabomber case documents. 84 million names.

112
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,980
探员就不用再到成堆的箱子里翻找
So agents didn't have to search through stacks of boxes anymore.

113
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:06,780
调查局在一夜之间改变
The Bureau changed overnight.

114
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:11,150
-这不只是档案系统 -这是探员的图书馆
This is more than just a filing system. It's a library of special agents.

115
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:14,200
汇集了你跟我的精华
It's the best of you. It's the best of me.

116
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:17,790
这是梦想
It's the dream.

117
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:22,540
这是梦想
It's the dream.

118
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,920
我不懂为何联调局会拒绝
I don't understand why the Bureau would say no.

119
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:30,550
采用这项科技就代表整个调查程序
Adopting this technology would mean entire investigations

120
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:34,640
不会依赖某个探员的判断或记忆
don't depend on one agent's judgment... or their memory.

121
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:37,260
我们可以回放任何的访谈
You could play back any interview.

122
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:40,060
参考任何的案件 即使你正在外调查也是一样
Reference any case. Even if you're in the field.

123
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:43,310
这是防止偏见和错误的护栏
It's a guardrail against bias and error.

124
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,610
好
Okay.

125
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:49,570
你觉得乌尔为什么 这么执着于局里的科技
Why do you think Hour is so fixated on the Bureau's technology?

126
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:51,150
我才刚跟你解释过原因
I just told you why.

127
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:53,030
动机…
Motivations...

128
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:55,530
可能很复杂
...can be complicated.

129
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:59,290
你要扯到哪里去
Where are you going with this?

130
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:11,970
（性倾向与压抑性格 不可预测性）

131
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:16,680
-现在又不是1960年代 -这不是批判
-This isn't the 1960s. - It's not a judgment.

132
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:18,970
-看起来就是 -这是洞见
- It certainly looks like one. - It's an insight.

133
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:22,810
乌尔的技术透露了她什么事
What would Hour's tech say about her?

134
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:27,190
透露出她非常关切公平与正义
It would say that she cares deeply about fairness and justice.

135
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,400
或者她对科技的信赖程度超过人类
Or that she trusts technology more than she trusts people.

136
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:35,820
或许她想为其他人 创造一个公平的世界
May-Maybe she wants to create a fairer world

137
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:37,030
而那个世界对她来说比较好
for others than that world has-has been for her.

138
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,580
我觉得听起来很棒 有什么…
That sounds great to me. What does...

139
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:40,450
如果这是她的动机又有什么关系
what does it matter if that's her motivation?

140
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,160
太过于私人了
It's deeply personal.

141
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:46,920
这不只是份提案 它深植于她的认同里
This isn't just a proposal. It's, it's... it's rooted in her identity.

142
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:50,960
理想如此深化 是很难放手的
When ideas go that deep, it's hard to let it go.

143
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,340
如果她无法改革调查局
If she can't reform the Bureau, she...

144
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:58,050
她可能会感受到比拒绝更深层的创伤
she might feel a kind of trauma that goes deeper than rejection.

145
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:00,810
这种事以前发生过 诗人
It's happened before, Poet.

146
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:02,720
我知道你晓得那些名字 我不必举出来
I know you know the names, I don't need to name them.

147
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:04,850
你不是要我回报她的技术
You didn't want me to report back on her tech.

148
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:09,110
你是要我在你关闭她的计画时 管理好她的情绪
You wanted me to manage her emotions if you shut her down.

149
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:15,190
她知道所有的秘密 诗人 她花了十年的时间搜集
She knows all of the secrets, Poet. She spent ten years collecting them.

150
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,660
你知道好笑的是什么吗 调查局声称
You know what's funny, the Bureau claims to want different types

151
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:21,330
要找具有不同经验的各类人士
of people with different experiences

152
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:23,540
却只要我们做该死的同一件事
so long as we all do the same fucking thing.

153
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,080
这个机构不是一张白纸 诗人
This institution isn't a blank page, Poet.

154
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,420
我没办法改写 其他人也是
I don't get to rewrite it, nor does anyone else.

155
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:39,140
1985年 本局创立了暴力犯罪逮捕计画
In 1985, the Bureau pioneered the Violent Criminal Apprehension Program.

156
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:43,890
这个计画的起点 是一套叫做VACS 11785的系统
ViCAP started on a system called the Vax 11/785.

157
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:45,350
大小跟这个房间差不多
It was the size of this room.

158
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:48,900
纳扎里探员 今天的听证会不是要谈过去的计画
Agent Nazari, today's hearing isn't about programs from the past--

159
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:51,020
过去是这次讨论内容的核心
The past is at the heart of what we're talking about.

160
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:54,940
重点在于保留知识 而不是让它溜走
It's about holding on to knowledge, rather than letting it slip away.

161
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,820
一个中央知识库
A central repository

162
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:01,070
记录了每次的犯罪调查
of every criminal investigation,

163
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,990
全国各地的每个探员都能存取
accessible by every agent in every part of the country.

164
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:08,210
在1985年是个高明的点子 但当时我们弃而不用
It was a brilliant idea in 1985. And we betrayed it then.

165
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:11,420
我们不能重蹈覆辙
We can't betray it again.

166
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:15,050
这个房间里的每个人 都能说出至少一名受害者
Every person in this room could name at least one victim who would still be alive today

167
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:18,380
如果执法人员把线索串连起来 这个人在今天还会活着
if law enforcement had connected the dots. You can appreciate how our agents

168
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:21,760
你可以理解探员有多么不想被监视
don't want to be spied on?

169
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:25,930
-我可以理解 是的 -你会让监视变成
I can appreciate that, yes. You-you would make spying a matter of-of what?

170
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:28,390
例行公事 每次的对话
Routine? Every conversation?

171
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:30,810
-不 这样说不公平… -抱歉 不好意思
Well, no, that's, that's an unfair character-- Excuse me, I'm sorry,

172
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,400
我们预测
but we predicted this would create

173
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:36,150
这会让本局面临招不到人的空前危机
a recruitment crisis of the kind the Bureau's never seen.

174
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,900
我们不能这么害怕 可能会得罪人的技术
We can't be so scared of technology treading on our toes

175
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:40,910
因此就认定它无用
that we render it useless.

176
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:46,120
今天 暴力犯罪逮捕计画 保存的资料还不到所有暴力犯罪的1%
Today ViCAP holds less than one percent of all violent crimes.

177
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:50,330
档案里应该要有超过五百万个案子 它却只有大约九万件
There should be over five million cases on file. It has around 90,000.

178
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:53,040
这个资料库搜集一切的资讯 无论那重不重要
Your database collects everything, whether it's important or not.

179
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:55,630
我们要搜集到了 才会知道什么是重要的
We don't know what's important until we collect it.

180
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:56,960
是啊 好吧
Yeah, okay.

181
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:03,340
这个论点…让人们担心
That rationale worries people.

182
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:06,470
你提议的是自动化搜索
What you're proposing is an industrial trawler.

183
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:10,480
我们有探员 那是我们训练出来 也是我们信赖的人
We have agents who we train and-and who we trust...

184
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:13,310
这不是建立在不信任上面的资料库
This is not a database built on mistrust.

185
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:16,230
这是探员们的累积智慧
It's the accumulated wisdom of the agents

186
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,990
来自诸多前辈和我现在的同事
who've served before me and who serve today.

187
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:22,410
它不是要取代或监视他们 而是把他们连结起来
It doesn't replace them or spy on them. It connects them.

188
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:26,830
-探员一直都在做判断 -它比我们聪明
The agent always makes the judgments. It's smarter than us, faster than us,

189
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:30,580
比我们快 比我们公平
fairer than us.

190
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:33,040
纳扎里探员 这不是你的论点吗
Isn't that your contention, Agent Nazari?

191
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:38,460
我的论点是 它协助我们 变得更聪明 更快 也更公平
My contention is that it helps us become smarter and faster and fairer.

192
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:57,400
我需要喝一杯
I need a drink.

193
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:20,670
他们会在月底关闭这里
They're shutting us down at the end of the month.

194
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:25,720
这不是你们的错 你们表现杰出
It's not your fault. You did extraordinary work.

195
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:32,520
只是我们的时运不济
It wasn't our time.

196
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:38,230
我很骄傲…
I'm proud...

197
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,450
嫌犯马克图皮瑞克 拥有强大火力 极度危险
Suspect Mark Tupirik is heavily armed and extremely dangerous.

198
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,330
收到 你可以走了
Copy that. Move on.

199
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:05,420
可以走了 往前开
Go ahead. You can go.

200
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:09,890
往前 快点
Move up! Come on!

201
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:17,480
你们要去哪里
Where you guys heading?

202
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:19,650
只是要去送个货
Just making a delivery.

203
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:21,770
请靠边停
Pull in, please.

204
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:27,740
（建设公司 土木工程与混凝土专家）

205
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,480
这些人没问题
These guys are good.

206
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:14,370
图皮瑞克人在哪里
Where's Tupirik now?

207
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,250
他要去哪里
Where's he going?

208
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:22,750
他打算何时发动攻击
What's he planning to attack?

209
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:27,630
我们可以整天坐在这里
We can sit here all day.

210
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:31,840
获准再审问他24小时
Been granted another 24 hours to question him.

211
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:35,350
太好了 再多24小时 他也只是不发一语
Mm, great. Another 24 hours of him saying nothing.

212
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:12,130
-我们有什么损失  -不可以 长官
- What have we got to lose? - No way, sir.

213
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:15,300
那是华府想要从中央 细部管理每个外地办公室
It's D.C. trying to micromanage every field office from the center.

214
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:18,640
对 但我们在追的人 拥有比我们精良的电脑
Yeah, but the people we're chasing, they've got better computers than we do.

215
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:21,770
如果总部启动那个资料库 它将取代我们
If HQ rolls that database, it will replace us.

216
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:24,980
还有我的上级 我是说真的
And then above me, too. I'm telling you.

217
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:28,230
你打开那个盒子 就永远无法再阖上
You open that box, you'll never be able to close it.

218
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,900
你真是救星 长官
You're a lifesaver, sir.

219
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:11,440
喝过之后再说
Don't say that yet, until you taste it.

220
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:13,530
-来 给你 -我相信一定好喝
- Here you go, man. - I'm sure it's great.

221
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:14,820
-非常感谢 -好 谢谢你
- I really appreciate it. - All right, thank you.

222
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:16,990
-非常感谢 祝你今天顺心 -好的
- Thank you so much. You have a good day. - All right.

223
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,530
（西北山电力公司）

224
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:06,850
去你的
Fuck you!

225
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:13,580
-我很好… -是 但我不好
I'm okay. I'm okay. Yeah, but I'm not okay.

226
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,010
玻璃是怎么回事
Tell me about the glass.

227
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:31,520
我们面临威胁
There were threats.

228
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:34,690
-好 什么时候  -一直都有威胁
- Okay, when? - There've always been threats

229
00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:35,980
从我们搬来这里之后
from the moment that we got here.

230
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:37,270
你怎么什么都没说
Why didn't you say something?

231
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,280
因为我不想让他们进我们的脑袋里
Because I didn't want them to get in our heads.

232
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:41,900
亲爱的 我以前就面临过死亡威胁
Baby, I've had death threats before.

233
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,830
对 听我说 我…
Okay. Okay.

234
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:52,870
我以前没想过我会跟任何人共度一生
I never imagined that I'd spend my life with anyone.

235
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:57,380
现在 我没有办法想象没有你的人生
And now, I can't imagine my life without you.

236
00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:00,170
但保护我不受世界威胁不是你的工作
But it's not your job to protect me from the world.

237
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:01,630
那是我唯一的工作
That's my only job.

238
00:25:03,050 --> 00:25:04,760
如果做不到这点 这一切有何意义
What's the point of all this if I can't do that?

239
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:15,350
如果让我们觉得安全的唯一方法 是我辞职…
If the only way that we can feel safe is for me to quit... you say the word.

240
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:20,230
-你只要开口 -那你要做什么
And what would you do, hmm? I don't know.

241
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:24,530
我不知道 照顾孩子
Look after the kids?

242
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,780
我们没有孩子
We don't have any kids.

薇 我向上帝发誓…
Viv, I swear to God, I swear to God,

244
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:38,170
如果你要我辞职
if you need me to quit,

245
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:40,750
我就会辞职
then I'll quit.

246
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:43,470
对不起…
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

247
00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:45,880
真的对不起 亲爱的
I'm so sorry, baby.

248
00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:50,970
你早知道会有这次的袭击
You knew about the attack!

249
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:53,480
什么袭击
What attack?

250
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:58,150
你的朋友死了 我太太还活着
Your friends are dead, my wife is still alive,

251
00:25:58,270 --> 00:26:00,900
我们会再次从头审问你
and we are going to start this interview again.

252
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:11,540
-那些人拒绝使用它 -对 你的人曾经有机会
The men refuse to use it. Yeah, well, your men had the chance.

253
00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:17,420
我必须跟纳扎里探员谈谈
I need to speak to Special Agent Nazari.

254
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,570
-喔 嗨 -嗨
- Hi. - Hi.

255
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:53,490
-你好吗 你的气色很不错 -不 你的气色才好
- Look at you. Oh, you look amazing. - Well, you look amazing.

256
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:55,290
-嗨 -嗨
- Hi. - Hi.

257

很高兴再见到你 波伊特
Good to see you again, Poet.

258

You, too. Um, your house is... amazing.

别管房子了 妈 爸
Forget the house. Mom? Pop?

260

来 我要你们见见波伊特
Yeah. I want you to meet Poet.

261
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:08,840
-你好 可以抱你一下吗  -你好
- Hi. Can I give you a hug?

262
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:10,640
-当然 -真高兴见到你
- Of course. - It's so nice to meet you.

263
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,600
天啊 不敢相信这是你们第一次见面
Oh, my God. I can't believe this is the first time you're meeting.

264
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,260
-我也很高兴见到你 -他们应该要在
- Nice to meet you as well. - They were supposed

265
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:17,060
我的毕业典礼上见面 但我爸妈来不了
to meet at my, uh, graduation, but they couldn't make it.

266

He gave this to me right before he died.

406
00:41:22,530 --> 00:41:24,570
这个跟你创造的系统有何差异
How is this different than what you created?

407
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:27,530
我创造的是犯罪资料库
I created a criminal database.

408
00:41:27,990 --> 00:41:30,450
它搜集资讯然后呈现给我们
It collected information and presented it to us.

409
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:33,670
-所有的思考都是我们做的 -像是图书馆
All of the thinking was done by us. It was a library.

410
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:36,500
这个系统会自己建立连结
This system is making connections on its own.

411
00:41:36,630 --> 00:41:39,090
我没有看到任何由探员发出的指令
I don't see any commands being issued by agents.

412
00:41:39,170 --> 00:41:42,340
我看到凭空出现的互动线
I see new lines of interactions coming out of nowhere.

413
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:44,010
它不需要人
It doesn't need people?

414
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:48,680
它需要有关人的资料 但没错 它不需要人
It needs data about people. But no, it does not need people.

415
00:41:49,930 --> 00:41:52,180
这是跟我们截然不同的智慧
This is an intelligence nothing like our own.

416
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:53,520
它有什么能耐
What is it capable of?

417
00:41:53,770 --> 00:41:54,850
波伊特探员
Special Agent Poet...

418
00:41:56,150 --> 00:41:57,440
你一直被蒙蔽
You've been lied to.

419
00:41:58,610 --> 00:42:00,400
这个系统能自行运作
The system is acting on its own.

420
00:42:01,030 --> 00:42:04,400
决定有罪和无罪 进行预测性逮捕
Deciding guilt and innocence. Making predictive arrests.

421
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:07,780
你必须调查泰约真正知道的事
You must investigate what Tayo really knows.

422
00:42:15,870 --> 00:42:19,630
（现在）

423
00:42:58,080 --> 00:42:59,170
想说来听听吗
You want to share?

424
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:03,960
你以为你逮到我了
Oh, you think you caught me.

425
00:43:05,090 --> 00:43:06,220
我是逮到你了
I have caught you.

426
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:09,510
但这里正是我想待的地方
But I'm exactly where I want to be.

427
00:43:09,930 --> 00:43:11,300
被关在这里 真的吗
Oh, locked up in here? Really?

428
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,020
最好的观众席
Best seat in the house.

429
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:17,350
好吧 为什么
Okay. Why is that?

430
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:22,980
因为我可以看清楚 你听到消息时脸上的表情
'Cause I get to see the expression on your face when you hear the news.

431
00:43:25,530 --> 00:43:26,570
什么消息
What news?

432
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:29,360
什么消息
What news?!

433
00:43:34,490 --> 00:43:35,830
我从没想过…
I never imagined...

434
00:43:38,410 --> 00:43:39,620
“从没想过”
Never imagined?

435
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:44,670
你还在这里
You'd still be here.

436
00:43:47,170 --> 00:43:48,260
我也没想到
I didn't either.

437
00:43:55,470 --> 00:43:56,970
这些年我错过了什么
Where are the years I missed?

438
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:03,730
我很高兴你在
I'm happy you're here.

439
00:44:06,530 --> 00:44:07,610
我也是
I'm happy, too.

440
00:44:11,450 --> 00:44:12,530
你一定累了
You must be tired.

441
00:44:14,030 --> 00:44:16,490
-晚安 诗人 -晚安
Good night, Poet. Good night.

442
00:46:17,110 --> 00:46:19,120
