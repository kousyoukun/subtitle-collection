1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,079
我們將是一個團射擊
松雞在黑暗中棲息。

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:07,199
槍聲
萊利,杏仁。

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,759
還記得降落傘嗎？

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,599
斯特林想知道
如果我們再做一次。

5
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:12,999
我不要求任何東西
除許可外。

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,119
還有60名男子。

7
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:16,239
我會根據選擇的男人
按照我自己的標準。

8
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:18,079
你為什麼要打架
在沙漠里,戴夫？

9
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,039
好吧,我只想殺人
他們是法西斯主義者,先生。

10
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:22,559
這個團不全是帕迪斯,
是嗎？

11
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,279
如果您決定加入他們,
我也會加入SAS。

12
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:28,519
他們被送到了一個地方
叫卡布裡特,

13
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:31,119
落後德國人200英里
和義大利線。

14
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,679
他們的生存機會有多大？

15
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,239
10%?

16
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,639
這是SAS大本營。

17
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,839
阻止法西斯主義的推進
整個非洲現在都落在我們身上。

18
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,320
上帝幫助我們。

19
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,240
風吹

20
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,800
軍樂

21
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,080
稍息！

22
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,600
付錢給瘋子。他是瘋子！

23
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,479
這裡！你們郵遞員有問題嗎
有一點風？

24
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,679
哦,帕迪,閉嘴。

25
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,639
我會飛其中一個
我自己操東西。

26
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,679
當然只是一輛卡車
雄心勃勃。

27
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,879
好了,這就夠了。

28
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:55,000
不應該和我一起變得聰明。
讓開。

29
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:03,559
先生們,我明白了
您對天氣的擔憂。

30
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,839
這不是天氣。

31
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,759
這是整個沙漠
升到空中。

32
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,039
奧金萊克將軍將搬家
他的第八軍

33
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:13,199
對抗隆美爾的前線
為了緩解托布魯克。

34
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,999
如果托布魯克倒下...
托布魯克不會倒下！

35
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,039
..接下來是開羅和蘇伊士運河。

36
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:23,159
馬爾他和地中海
像多米諾骨牌一樣倒塌。

37
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:27,199
它以隆美爾滾動結束
他的裝甲車在購物中心

38
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,759
朝向白金漢宮。

39
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:31,519
他的飛機不得攻擊
我們的部隊。

40
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:34,039
SAS 已經訓練了幾個月
把他們炸在地上。

41
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,759
我們不會退縮。
許多人的生命依賴於我們。

42
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,479
這是上帝的工作。

43
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,039
我們對此只有一次機會。

44
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,959
你明白嗎？你的工作是
拯救我們,回頭。

45
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,999
我們將走自己的路回家。

46
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,159
風速為30節。

47
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:50,279
15 節被認為是不安全的。

48
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,279
戰爭他媽的不安全！

49
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,399
好了,夠了。足夠。此外！

50
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,600
斯特林船長比你高。

51
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,719
你將不得不和你自己睡覺
良心如果奧金萊克的進步

52
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:07,800
被空中優勢阻止
托布魯克落入敵人之手。

53
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,240
讓你的人登機。

54
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,120
好人。

55
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,799
是不是太過分了？
我認為進展得相當順利。

56
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,680
瘋狂的混蛋。

57
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,120
袋子裡有家裡的信。

58
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,759
時間就是現在！

59
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,039
公司3,準備好了嗎？全體:先生！

60
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,320
我們啪啪啪。

61
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,320
是時候了,小夥子們。

62
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,000
公司2！

63
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,120
公司1！

64
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,039
“親愛的母親。

65
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,079
“如果我不回來
還有一具屍體要燃燒,

66
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,799
“把我的骨灰撒在石楠中
讓松雞嘲笑我的命運。

67
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,999
“因為現在是我和我的戰友

68
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,799
誰是鬆雞
飛到槍上。

69
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:05,559
“在我們之下是敵人
甚至現在都在載入

70
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,480
“並瞄準。”

71
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:11,239
“我最親愛的米倫。
你知道我愛你。

72
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:14,079
“我知道我可以讓你這麼開心
你不想死

73
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,879
“萬一天堂沒有那麼好。

74
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:19,039
“只要說是,你就會嫁給我
當我是一個合格的船長時,

75
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,159
“我不會問你
把它放在報紙上,

76
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,639
“因為我今晚可能會死。

77
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,919
“然後人們會說'哈哈'
或者他們會說「可憐的親愛的」,

78
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,919
“兩者都很可怕。

79
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,679
“如果這一切
是我的一個美夢,

80
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,640
“嗯,一直很可愛
做夢。

81
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,679
偉大的潛力
這些人是巨大的。

82
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,679
“我只是希望這些其他官員
看得出來。

83
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,119
」或者他們會被添加到長
銀勺餵食的白癡名單...”

84
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,639
“我混在一起的這套新衣服
很好奇。

85
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:50,719
「在我們短暫的時期
訓練,男人們一直活下去

86
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,479
“朗姆酒和酸橙,朗姆酒和茶...”

87
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:56,839
“親愛的姐姐。我有一個非常
與這個新單位一起快樂的時光。

88
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,399
“我真誠地希望我有機會

89
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,799
“向軍官展示我能做什麼
用步槍。

90
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,079
“這是一群優秀的小夥子,愛,
所以你不用擔心。

91
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,559
“你只是得到了所有的幸福
走出你可以的生活。

92
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,399
“任何能給你帶來幸福的東西,
孩子。

93
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,359
他們大喊大叫
去他媽的。

94
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,520
風呼嘯

95
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:17,479
“我和一位老人團聚了
阿爾斯特步槍隊的朋友。

96
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:20,399
“他是新教徒。帕迪·梅恩。

97
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,360
“雖然他喝得像個天主教徒。

98
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,559
“我們可以談論家
彼此之間。

99
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,559
“他就是我認識的那個人
在愛爾蘭,

100
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,479
“但最近,我被他改變了。”

101
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:36,119
這裡有一個人
我在阿爾斯特認識。伊恩·麥戈尼格爾。

102
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:39,319
他來自另一邊,
但我們不談論宗教。

103
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:42,999
“如果我坐起來吠叫和嚎叫
晚上,就像我有時做的那樣,

104
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,999
“他帶我去散步
然後扔了一根棍子給我。

105
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,799
“當我發現自己變成了魔鬼時,

106
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,400
“他提醒我,在下面
我是一個詩人。

107
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,360
先生！飛行員想和你說幾句話。

108
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,600
沒什麼可擔心的,小夥子們。

109
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,400
只是有點樂趣,嗯？

110
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,599
我們離下降還有兩分鐘。

111
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:25,880
但是斯特林船長,如果你出去
在這一點上,這將是自殺。

112
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:31,079
自殺,斯特林船長,
而已。

113
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:34,840
回頭並不丟人
在這樣的夜晚。

114
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,320
想想你的男人。

115
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,639
船上的先生們已被評估
他們的處境

116
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,400
並做出了決定。

117
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,600
繼續下降。

118
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,800
瘋狂的混蛋要跳了。

119
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,159
我們準備好了嗎,夥計們？

120
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,279
所有人:是的,先生！

121
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,479
這是十英里的步行路程
到簡易機場。

122
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,359
我們會轟炸他們的飛機
當他們睡覺時

123
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,239
並與帕迪會合
和喬克的男孩

124
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,439
朗姆酒早餐,是嗎？
所有人:是的！

125
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,319
血腥地獄,米徹姆,
你臉色蒼白。

126
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,119
你被誘惑了嗎？沒有,先生。不？

127
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,280
近！

128
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,239
好了,聽好了！

129
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:52,640
不許胡說八道！

130
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,680
站起來。

131
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,720
勾搭。

132
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,560
喊命令

133
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,839
行動站！

134
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,200
觸發釋放！

135
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,880
風呼嘯,男人喊

136
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,160
大喊大叫

137
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,560
喊聲

138
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,200
風安靜下來

139
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,399
遠處喊道:L支隊！

140
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,280
L 支隊！

141
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,920
霍頓？蓋茨？米查姆？

142
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,880
呼吸困難

143
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,239
L 支隊！

144
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,080
蓋茨,米徹姆！

145
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,439
呻吟

146
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,719
先生！

147
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,679
哦！先生！

148
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,360
呻吟

149
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,160
我曾經是。。。我被拖了
懸崖那邊。

150
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,239
啊！你能站得住嗎？

151
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,759
不。

152
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,879
我不能忍受,先生。

153
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,760
我聽到我的脊椎折斷了。

154
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,439
就像他媽的槍聲。

155
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,000
尖叫

156
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,879
你想要一些水嗎？

157
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,640
我受不了這種痛苦。

158
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,640
對不起。米徹姆,不！

159
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,240
喊:操！

160
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,480
願主憐悯
在你的靈魂上。

161
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,480
在我的身上。

162
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,880
嗯,父親？

163
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:13,040
你說戰爭可能不愉快。

164
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,200
我找到了炸藥和機槍。

165
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:33,400
然後財富與我們同在。
我們走。

166
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,599
搬到哪裡去,先生？

167
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,519
機場。

168
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:43,120
我們只有八個人,先生。

169
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:48,759
所以對他們來說會更難
從空中看到我們。加油。

170
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,000
熱。

171
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,159
你的胳膊怎麼了？

172
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,920
它壞了,先生。

173
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,999
然後。。。

174
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,919
..你很幸運,在 SAS 中,

175
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,560
你不必敬禮。

176
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,919
呐喊,嘶吼

177
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:13,199
現在,在我們繼續之前,

178
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,199
我們需要確定
機場在哪裡。

179
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:19,039
要做到這一點,我們需要確定
我們在哪裡。

180
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,599
萊利,我相信你留住了
你的指南針。

181
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,959
我只能肯定地說
機場在海岸上

182
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:28,119
而且我們在他們的南方。

183
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,959
好。

184
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,440
所以我們向北走。

185
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,960
我們只有八個人...先生。

186
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:41,120
如果你做出這樣的觀察
再。。。

187
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,880
..我們只有七個人。

188
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:49,119
我會向北走
即使我一個人。

189
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,240
右。我們還有工作要做。

190
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:06,119
你覺得呢
有一個遙遠的邊境小鎮

191
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:09,279
沙漠邊緣的某個地方

192
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,479
我們知道的最後一塊土地？

193
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,719
槍聲

194
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:17,400
有些憔悴,最終
我們的光的極限

195
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,800
我會發現你在等。

196
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:25,959
我們會一起去
再次攜手

197
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:29,960
進入廢墟
我們不知道

198
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,400
走進光明。

199
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,280
槍聲

200
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,880
啊？哦,謝謝。

201
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,560
麥戈尼格爾,先生。

202
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,880
哦。

203
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,520
還行。

204
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:23,920
還行。

205
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,960
他落地了所有的內臟...
是的,我明白。

206
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,840
您是否設法找到
任何武器？

207
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,320
只找到一挺機槍
和六枚手榴彈。

208
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,320
沒有炸藥或雷管。

209
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,399
他們都將被埋在沙子里
由於風。

210
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,639
我們會使用你的手榴彈。
什麼？

211
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:59,639
我們將向北走,
那他媽的方式,在那裡。

212
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:03,879
我們將到達海岸,
我們會找到我們的機場。

213
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:06,439
是的,好吧,帕迪,我們不會破壞
一個他媽的東西

214
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,879
用我們所擁有的,小夥子。水稻。

215
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,440
我們要向南走。

216
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:13,319
先生,烏雲密佈——
要下雨了。

217
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:16,439
我們需要搬到更高的地方
在我們被沖走之前。

218
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,999
右。

219
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,719
這是個搞砸的,是嗎？

220
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:22,519
這是一個偉大的老混蛋。
現在,如果我們消滅自己,

221
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:25,119
這將是唯一的事情
我們曾經做過,帕迪。

222
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:27,519
他們會說我們曾經做過的一切
被搞砸了。

223
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:31,719
GHQ會嘲笑我們。
所以你的結論

224
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,920
我們應該退縮嗎？

225
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,599
是這樣嗎？

226
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,759
帕迪,我不是說...

227
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:41,319
你的結論,下士,
是我們應該退縮。

228
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,439
我不是沒有意思。
是這樣嗎？

229
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,040
在他們對他做了什麼之後？
不是他們殺了他。

230
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,639
是風和秋天
和我們的決定,

231
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,440
我們都做出了決定。

232
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,520
對不起,先生。

233
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,040
帕迪,我們需要活著
再去一次。

234
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,520
那麼我們應該搬出去嗎？

235
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,200
下雨了。水稻
我們不能離開沒有你。

236
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,600
沒事的。去。

237
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,160
我會追上你的。

238
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,280
去。

239
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:45,080
對,收拾你的物品
然後滾蛋。

240
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,080
遙遠的雷聲

241
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,680
雨落

242
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,040
雷霆墜毀

243
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,400
來吧,庫珀,從那裡起來！

244
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,559
把手給我。

245
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,479
我們甚至知道我們要去哪裡嗎,
先生？

246
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,680
答案是肯定的！

247
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,880
千斤頂！

248
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,199
指南針裡有水。

249
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,919
也在鬆散的炸彈中。

250
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:03,639
他們渾身濕透。
完全沒用。

251
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:07,119
我們包裡的炸彈被稱為
劉易斯轟炸,因為路易斯是我的名字

252
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,039
我他媽的發明了它們。

253
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,399
我會決定它們什麼時候沒用！

254
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,079
喊

255
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,719
看在上帝的份上,把他弄出去！

256
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,759
來吧,你沒事吧。

257
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:19,920
除非你想讓我們都淹死,
我們必須重新開始。

258
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,360
你知道我曾經在泰晤士河上游泳嗎？

259
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,639
從塔橋。

260
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,719
正如尤利烏斯·凱撒
游了台伯河。

261
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:34,200
休息一下！千斤頂！

262
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,559
看。。。

263
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:40,239
水變成了沙漠
變成流沙。

264
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,519
你不能走過流沙,
更不用說游泳了。

265
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:48,319
我不是建議,萊利,
我是凱撒大帝,

266
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:52,000
但就像凱撒一樣,我的第一次嘗試
在征服被挫敗了。

267
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:56,199
愷撒撤退了,又回來了。

268
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,879
這就是我們將要做的。

269
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:00,760
我們會去,
但我們會回來的。

270
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,439
是的。

271
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,120
可以肯定。

272
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,520
來吧,你聽到了那個人的聲音。動！

273
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,080
風哨

274
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,080
我能聽到歌聲。

275
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,160
遙遠的歌唱

276
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:51,240
唱歌繼續

277
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:58,079
現在你唱第二節
為了讓他們放心

278
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,719
我們不是德國人。

279
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:03,239
在卡布裡特,我們軍官決心
沙漠程式。

280
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:06,199
如果你在夜裡看到火,
你唱第一節

281
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,599
和火場上的人
唱第二節。

282
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:13,160
因為如果我們是德國人,
我們不會知道這些詞。

283
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,880
你們中的任何一個小夥子都知道
第二節？

284
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,799
不。

285
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,999
不。井。。。

286
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,999
..如果你不唱
在下一個...30秒,

287
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,840
然後程式是開火。

288
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:35,239
如果帕迪在那裡,
這將是五秒鐘。

289
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,440
天啊,這一切是多麼有趣。

290
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:44,159
# 冰雹,冰雹,幫派都在這裡

291
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:47,839
# 我們到底在乎什麼？
我們到底在乎什麼？

292
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,559
# 我們到底在乎什麼？

293
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:53,039
# 冰雹,冰雹,幫派都在這裡

294
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:56,599
# 我們到底在乎什麼？
現在。。。

295
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:59,959
# 推出桶

296
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:03,039
# 我們會玩得很開心

297
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:06,919
全部:# 推出桶
加油！

298
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:09,480
# 我們有藍調在奔跑

299
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,599
# 唱歌、樹、塔拉瑞爾

300
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:17,119
# 唱出一首歡呼之歌

301
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:20,799
# 現在是時候滾動桶了

302
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,920
# 為了幫派都在這裡！#

303
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,760
好嗎,先生？

304
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,679
除了那幫人不是...

305
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,559
..都在這裡,是嗎？

306
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:41,120
不,這幫人並不都在這裡。

307
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,400
只有我們。

308
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:01,160
低沉的談話

309
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,239
有一些,呃...

310
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,960
..茶,稻田。

311
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,960
來吧,夥計。

312
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,679
我們來了。

313
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,560
水稻？

314
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,080
婉轉的音樂播放

315
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,919
# 部隊中的同胞

316
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:46,119
# 正在寫信

317
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:48,679
# 來自東方的某個地方

318
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,679
# 談論眨眼的盛宴

319
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:53,159
# 他說這隻是布萊克浦金沙

320
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,599
# 我們玩手榴彈

321
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,399
# 如果我們知道
我們會帶上

322
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,319
# 我們的水桶和黑桃

323
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:04,879
# 在中東
你可以玩得很開心

324
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:09,399
# 在中東
由地中海

325
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,599
# 聯手,
他們曾經說過

326
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,839
# 看世界
聽起來還行

327
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:16,439
# 但你整天看到的只有沙子

328
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,839
# 在中東

329
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,839
# 當你餓了

330
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:22,839
# 他們從不為你服務
一些火鍋

331
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:27,239
# 你永遠不會得到微風
吹風吹來吹去

332
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,879
# 頭上戴著帽子
像平底鍋蓋

333
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:32,199
# 你脫掉你的
好吧,我從來沒有做過

334
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,399
# 有點熱...#

335
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,599
看起來像我們的乘客
已經到了。

336
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,999
我以為有55個。

337
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,319
不用擔心。

338
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,720
您仍將獲得報酬
如果你空著開車回家。

339
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,520
毫米。

340
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:54,720
遠端沙漠集團！
表明自己的身份。

341
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,120
庫 珀。

342
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:06,280
我們是L支隊,
第一特種空勤旅。

343
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,880
我們剩下的。

344
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,359
也許這是你的態度。

345
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,399
也許這是你走路的方式。

346
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,320
但你走在鋼絲上。

347
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,919
這是一片大沙漠,

348
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:29,239
但是裡面沒有空間

349
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:33,239
對於現實主義者或實用主義者

350
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:35,480
或常識的信徒。

351
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:43,280
昨晚是第一個不確定的
踏上通往榮耀的漫長道路。

352
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:49,320
沒有其他敘述。

353
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:04,519
就是這樣,老男孩,來吧。

354
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,959
發生了什麼事？

355
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:08,719
我們經歷了一些天氣。
啊,是的。

356
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,119
你在這裡負責嗎？

357
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:12,840
沙漠在這裡負責。
也許你已經學會了,先生。

358
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:25,239
托布魯克有什麼消息？
我們已經遠離了廣播。

359
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:30,599
加油。洗個澡,
喝一瓶啤酒,或喝兩杯,或三杯,

360
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:33,960
然後我們將討論托布魯克。
加油。

361
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,160
又搞砸了？

362
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,440
又是一樁混蛋。

363
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:47,639
但無論如何,我們開人力車
進城。

364
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:50,119
我們還能期待多少？

365
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,839
啊...

366
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,359
..我們經歷的天氣
非常糟糕,先生。

367
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:55,719
是的。

368
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,160
也許不多。

369
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:00,839
右。而且,呃...

370
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,960
你想等多久？

371
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,800
哦,你知道的。

372
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,160
永遠。

373
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,440
毫米。

374
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:15,239
不,我不喜歡等待。

375
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,839
我在開羅有一個撲克遊戲
週四。

376
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,040
喊叫:我們有一些牛
四捨五入。

377
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,159
走吧,孩子們。加油。
在你的腳上。

378
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,200
加油！

379
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,320
音樂:慢速騎行
作者:福加特

380
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,680
# 慢行

381
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:52,400
# 放輕鬆

382
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,680
# 慢速騎行...#

383
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:03,719
# 我有很多錢
在我愛人家攢錢...#

384
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:06,919
哼唱曲調
大躍進,男孩們！

385
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:09,119
# 放輕鬆

386
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,560
哎 呦

387
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,319
# 慢行

388
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:15,399
百日咳

389
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,440
# 放輕鬆

390
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,760
# 我有心情

391
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,000
# 押韻是對的
嗚呼！

392
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:30,680
# 移至音樂

393
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:34,079
# 我們可以整夜滾動...#

394
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,999
你到底要怎麼做
在這片廣袤的土地上找到他們？

395
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,439
在沙漠中,一切
可以預測。

396
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,639
你被扔在北邊的四邊形,
12號。

397
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,199
然後雨來了。

398
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,719
不斷上漲的洪水送走你的孩子
在高地上。

399
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:48,039
鴨嘴獸嶺,
向南延伸,

400
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:50,840
所以他們向南走
直到山脊分裂。

401
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,920
滾回去。

402
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,960
哈哈！

403
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,000
加油！

404
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,959
然後他們到達綠洲,

405
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:08,480
連英國人都可以看到
由於植被。

406
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,680
加油！

407
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,839
然後他們跟隨
乾涸的河床南

408
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:18,239
直到他們到達...

409
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,640
..差不多...

410
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,560
..現在。繞到那裡。

411
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:42,199
看起來我會做的
我的撲克遊戲。

412
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,200
# 我有心情

413
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,440
# 節奏正確

414
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,839
# 移至音樂...#

415
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:56,040
我只數了我們八個人。

416
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,160
22名倖存者出...

417
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,959
..55.

418
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:06,719
沒有開一槍,
除了一個該死的好士兵

419
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,480
向他自己的大腦開火。

420
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:14,600
沒有一架飛機被摧毀,不是
一個該死的雷管引爆了。

421
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,560
GHQ會做什麼？

422
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,360
關於什麼？

423
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:24,919
什麼也沒發生。
我們的使命從未被授權,

424
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,839
所以沒有人會知道。

425
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:29,399
GHQ有一些人知道,
他們會笑。

426
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,679
但。。。

427
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:33,839
..大多數情況下,他們會太忙了
輸掉戰爭來關心。

428
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:37,640
我們將被擱置
當我們回到開羅時。

429
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,359
是的。

430
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,960
如果我們回去。

431
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:50,519
他們說男孩們
來自遠端沙漠組

432
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:54,239
可以找到鉛筆
在1000平方英里的沙漠中

433
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:57,199
只要它投下陰影。

434
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:00,839
他們可以找到被擊落的飛行員
在英格蘭大小的地區

435
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:03,240
半夜
在沙塵暴中。

436
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,719
所以？

437
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,400
所以。。。我想知道...

438
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:14,039
..如果他們能找到 SAS
一個避難所。

439
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,720
喇叭嗶嗶聲

440
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,480
你好！

441
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,200
百日咳

442
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:26,120
樂隊演奏爵士音樂

443
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,840
你在這裡幹什麼？
槍聲

444
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,280
我來這裏放鬆一下。

445
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,039
我以為是時候了
相互更新

446
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,759
關於最近的一些事件。

447
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,919
你的辦公室被鎖住了。

448
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:04,239
最近發生的事件？戴高樂將軍
需要隨時了解情況

449
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,520
英國戰略
在北非。

450
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,399
法語 75.

451
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:13,519
告訴我,什麼是將軍的
目前主要關注的問題是什麼？

452
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:14,919
操你媽。

453
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,679
他們在哪？

454
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:19,479
你的意思是他們在哪裡？

455
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,160
或者他在哪裡？

456
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,119
你想吃晚飯嗎？

457
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:28,359
不。告訴我他們在哪裡。

458
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:31,680
沒有人在說什麼。
對開羅來說,這是不尋常的。

459
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,679
清嗓子
好吧,事實是,

460
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,319
沒有人知道他們在哪裡。

461
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:40,759
任何倖存者都應該有
兩周前報導過。

462
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:43,359
我們沒有溝通
任何類型的。

463
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,279
他們怎麼了？

464
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:48,239
好吧,在你開始想像之前
一些英勇的戰鬥,

465
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,599
幾乎可以肯定
如果他們都死了,

466
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:53,639
他們沒有被德國人殺死
或義大利人。

467
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,359
他們被沙漠殺死了。

468
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,400
風,沙子,荊棘。

469
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,679
哦,通過魯莽的決定

470
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,999
由我們的朋友拍攝
和他的戰友

471
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,519
因為他們無法忍受
丟臉。

472
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:09,199
他們決定起飛
並在晚上降落傘降落

473
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:12,079
在中間
一場該死的沙塵暴。

474
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:14,960
斯特林是怎麼回事
你這麼不喜歡？

475
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:20,680
我發明瞭SAS。

476
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:26,039
他無權摧毀它
在其第一次任務中。

477
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:28,279
如果它沒有被摧毀,
它現在是一個笑柄

478
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,280
在少數人中
誰知道它的存在。

479
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:34,039
就百分比而言,
恐怕斯特林的機會

480
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:36,879
還活著
只是零的這一邊。

481
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:40,079
我以為你知道規則
戰時交戰。

482
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,479
他媽的沒事。

483
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,200
感覺不是。

484
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,880
音樂播放

485
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:13,759
那麼,現在。

486
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,399
我的朋友們,這是Jalo。

487
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,999
從字面上看,毫無疑問,

488
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,719
不可否認是中間的
他媽的無處可去。

489
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:25,799
如果他媽的無處可去
一個首都,就是這樣。

490
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:29,199
這將是主要街道
他媽的無處可去的城市。

491
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:33,159
市長大人會他媽的
沒有人,主持他媽的所有人

492
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:36,359
在一個沒有人的地方
周圍給他媽的。

493
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:39,880
這正是你所要求的,
斯特林船長,我說的對嗎？

494
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,879
我們可以繼續開車,
但我會說這個地方

495
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:46,479
與任何其他部分一樣好
我們可能無處可尋。

496
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,839
到德國機場有多遠？

497
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:51,239
蘇爾特位於西北350英里處。

498
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,839
盟軍前線？

499
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:55,439
盟軍的第一個陣地
你會來

500
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:59,399
是紐西蘭後備部隊,
80英里穿過開闊的沙漠。

501
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,479
但是紐西蘭人戰鬥的人
已被送往北方,

502
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:03,639
所以營地是空的。

503
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:05,319
如果您需要任何説明,
沒有。

504
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:08,239
紐西蘭營地空無一人,
你說？

505
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,199
幾個受傷,幾個警衛。

506
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:12,999
還有幾輛空卡車,
人們可以想像。

507
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,239
也許他們留下了一些槍。

508
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:16,719
也許是一些彈藥。

509
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,359
會有鋼琴嗎？

510
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,399
他媽的鋼琴？

511
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:24,199
他媽的無處可去的首都
會幫我們做得很好。

512
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:27,640
但首先,我們需要做
購物場所。

513
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,760
來吧,你這個害羞的混蛋。

514
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:37,640
音樂:我與法律作鬥爭
由衝突

515
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:48,039
# 在烈日下打破岩石

516
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,999
# 我與法律抗爭
法律贏了...#

517
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,639
小偷混蛋？從來不是我。

518
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:54,479
# 我與法律抗爭,法律贏了

519
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,479
# 我需要錢,因為我沒有錢

520
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,679
# 我與法律抗爭
法律贏了...#

521
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,719
如果我知道你要去
搶劫這個地方,

522
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:04,439
我不會帶你來的,先生。
叫我大衛,不要先生。

523
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:07,119
# ..感覺太糟糕了

524
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:09,240
# 猜猜我的比賽正在進行

525
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:13,679
# 她是最好的女孩
我曾經有過

526
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:16,639
# 我與法律抗爭,法律贏了

527
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,640
# 我與法律和

528
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:28,679
# 我與法律抗爭,法律贏了

529
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:32,199
# 我與法律抗爭,法律贏了

530
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:35,559
# 我與法律抗爭,法律贏了

531
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:38,759
喇叭嘶嘶嘶
# 我與法律抗爭,法律贏了

532
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:42,079
# 我與法律抗爭,法律贏了

533
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:44,999
#我与法律和...#
他們歡呼

534
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,960
飛利浦！哨兵值班。
在塔上,一個小時。

535
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:54,319
如果可以,也許你可以
埋葬炸藥罐

536
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,800
使它們遠離直接熱量。

537
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:59,079
我可以把鋼琴放在哪裡？

538
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:01,320
你彈鋼琴,帕迪？不。

539
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,559
Eoin試圖教我。

540
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:07,080
我想繼續。

541
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,719
把它放在食堂裡。

542
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,239
沒有食堂。

543
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,760
所以建立一個。

544
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,999
尋求？是的,老闆。

545
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,839
現在,昨晚
相當成功,

546
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,519
所以我們有一些值得慶祝的事情。

547
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,239
你偷了什麼
通過飲料的方式？

548
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:25,719
45加侖紐西蘭朗姆酒,先生。

549
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,079
好孩子。右。

550
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:29,919
所以當我們打開包裝時,
這將是雞尾酒時間。

551
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,279
然後當我們有了我們的
雞尾酒和太陽落山,

552
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:34,040
我認為我們應該去
有點快活。

553
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:38,959
彈藥將被登錄
弗雷澤中尉。

554
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:42,160
除非他對此有問題。
沒有,先生。

555
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:46,239
給你的車輛加油,薩德勒先生。

556
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,559
我們今晚去。

557
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:48,959
音樂:鋼鐵之輪
作者:撒克遜

558
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,839
把帳篷搭起來。
我們不要太有創意！

559
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,400
叫我邁克。

560
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:01,719
目標將在海岸上給出。

561
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:05,159
每人十枚路易斯炸彈。
準備就緒！

562
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:09,839
有十分鐘的保險絲
和您的30分鐘保險絲。

563
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:14,199
在可以之前不要使用炸彈
聞聞梅塞施密特的味道！

564
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:18,119
SAS任務第一！

565
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:20,519
搬出去,你們這些該死的處女。

566
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:22,000
來吧,鮑勃。

567
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:33,600
# 她有卑鄙的鋼輪

568
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,320
# 她有

569
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,560
# 鋼輪

570
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,120
# 鋼輪

571
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,880
# 談論我的鋼鐵之輪

572
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,880
# 鋼輪..#

573
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:58,799
我們在十英里外
蘇爾特簡易機場,正北。

574
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,039
我要選三個人,
把他們帶到那裡,

575
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,559
並盡我所能造成傷害。

576
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:05,359
劉易斯,你會帶走你的手下
到梅爾薩佈雷加。

577
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:08,159
您的目標是加油車
和供應卡車。

578
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,839
稻田,你帶你的手下
到塔梅特簡易機場。

579
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:14,279
您的目標是義大利卡普羅尼
戰鬥轟炸機和梅塞施密特。

580
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:17,520
比爾弗雷澤,你在哪裡？
我在這裡。加油。

581
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:25,599
我在搞砸的時候聽到
你反覆問的問題

582
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,200
你的指揮官。

583
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:33,479
好吧,我們已經決定,按順序
為了避免進一步的搞砸,

584
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:36,839
歡迎提問
在 SAS 中。

585
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:40,160
你會選擇四個男人
並前往阿格達比亞。

586
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:47,359
先生,如果歡迎提問,
我有一個問題。是的？

587
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,439
男孩們可以喝點朗姆酒嗎？
哦,當然。

588
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,279
請。加油。

589
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:55,279
右。我們在這裡會合
明天早上。

590
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,759
您和您的司機在這裡等候
為了我們的回歸。

591
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,239
恕我直言,先生,

592
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:01,439
我他媽的厭倦了
計程車服務。

593
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:04,040
我可以更好地閱讀這片沙漠
比這裡的任何人都要。

594
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:08,519
好吧,如果是行動
你所追求的,

595
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:10,000
和帕迪·梅恩一起去。

596
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:13,439
我們還有第二次機會。

597
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:16,239
讓我們看看星星是什麼
為我們準備了,好嗎？

598
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,920
男士歡呼

599
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:20,920
喊命令

600
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:01,200
它是空的。

601
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:05,080
他們都飛了。

602
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:08,440
狗屎。

603
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,960
主保險絲。十分鐘。

604
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:52,120
去。

605
00:43:56,600 --> 00:44:00,719
萊利。以一個人為例,
向右走。

606
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:03,360
杏仁,拿三個人,
從後方側翼回合。

607
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:06,359
八分鐘后回到這裡。

608
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:09,280
盡可能多地撞卡車。
看在上帝的份上,不要被人看到。

609
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:13,160
去。

610
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:42,359
薩德勒。哼？

611
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:45,639
這是一枚著名的路易斯炸彈。

612
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:47,279
從未聽說過。

613
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:50,119
那是因為它只有名聲
在我們中間。

614
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:52,879
喬克·路易斯發明瞭它。

615
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:54,639
他給我們煮了一個原型。

616
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:56,639
今晚,我們要
試試看。

617
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:58,119
您以前從未使用過它們？

618
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:00,479
不,但喬克·路易斯非常聰明。

619
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:02,000
我相信我們會沒事的。

620
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:07,359
這些都已準備就緒
十分鐘后就走了,對吧？

621
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:08,439
從現在開始？

622
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:09,800
從現在開始。

623
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:13,839
所以我們應該他媽的
加油,帕迪。

624
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:15,599
十分鐘足夠了,男孩們。

625
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:16,960
有足夠的時間做什麼？

626
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:21,280
遙遠的笑聲和喋喋不休

627
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:26,279
他們喝醉了,帕迪。

628
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:28,639
我們可以炸毀炸彈
並在他們知道之前消失...

629
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:32,000
唾手可得的果實,成熟的蘋果。

630
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:38,679
那些醉漢是飛行員
和工程師清醒時。

631
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:42,319
所以他媽的按照慣例,
日內瓦或其他。

632
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:44,239
這是我們他媽的工作,男孩們。

633
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:47,440
這就是我們,
殺戮和被殺。

634
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:54,799
任何男人都太公正、善良和高尚
因為這樣的工作可以留下來,

635
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:57,080
擦亮他們的子彈,
做一條漂亮的小項鍊。

636
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:02,280
我自己,我很平靜。

637
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:06,560
我從不參加派對
無論如何,我都被邀請參加。

638
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:20,759
低聲說:走。

639
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:23,120
那個,那個,那個。

640
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,960
喋喋不休

641
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:33,000
喧鬧的談話,錄音播放

642
00:47:58,640 --> 00:47:59,920
你想要一盞燈嗎？

643
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:02,480
給你。

644
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:05,839
不。英語,實際上。

645
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:07,360
笑

646
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:09,719
英語！

647
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:10,999
是的。

648
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,719
英語。

649
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:14,320
你好！

650
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:16,440
扼流圈

651
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:26,000
刀刮擦

652
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:31,799
喇叭布拉雷斯

653
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:34,200
用德語喊叫

654
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:36,960
他媽的。

655
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:48,199
晚上好。

656
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:49,720
錄音播放

657
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:02,240
炮火

658
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:06,880
搖滾樂

659
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:13,000
找掩護！

660
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:17,840
喊

661
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:27,279
三分鐘,炸彈爆炸！

662
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:29,920
包括這輛卡車！
不理想。

663
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:09,439
嗚咽

664
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:11,959
他們現在已經受夠了,帕迪。
水稻！

665
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:13,359
水稻！

666
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:15,000
炮火

667
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:22,640
兩分鐘吹飛機,
男孩。移動！

668
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:27,640
他媽的招式！

669
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:46,839
千斤頂？

670
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:49,719
一分鐘后,這輛卡車即將駛來
有點熱！

671
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:51,199
沒有説明。

672
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:52,920
加油！移動！

673
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,680
喊

674
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:05,960
帕迪在哪裡？

675
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:13,039
他到底在哪裡？

676
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:15,359
口哨
水稻！

677
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:17,440
水稻！

678
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:31,000
去！

679
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:42,599
尖叫

680
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:44,160
炸彈！

681
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:47,079
喊

682
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:48,399
移動！

683
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:49,600
去！去！

684
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:52,680
水稻！

685
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:01,640
他們嘩啦啦

686
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:06,119
回到那些吉普車上。

687
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:08,159
稻田,快點！

688
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:09,319
水稻！

689
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:12,000
音樂:新玫瑰
作者:《詛咒》

690
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:18,800
笑

691
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:22,439
# 我內心有一種感覺

692
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:24,400
爆炸淹沒音樂

693
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:31,039
# 我猜這些東西
必須

694
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:34,159
# 我有一朵新玫瑰
我有很好的

695
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:36,479
# 猜猜我知道我總是會

696
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:39,559
# 我不能停下來胡鬧
哎 呦

697
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:42,199
# 我在城裡得到了一朵嶄新的玫瑰

698
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:44,719
# 見太陽
看到太陽,它閃耀

699
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:47,199
# 我猜這些東西
必須

700
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:50,480
# 我得到了一朵新玫瑰
我做得很好...#

701
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:55,879
遠處的爆炸

702
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:57,279
男孩。

703
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:59,120
他們笑了

704
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:06,479
那是梅爾薩佈雷加和阿格達比亞
被吹到地獄了,先生。

705
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:08,080
是的！

706
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:12,520
遠處的爆炸

707
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:18,079
這就是Tamet的Paddy Mayne。

708
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:19,360
笑

709
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:24,479
我在黑暗中
和蘇爾特的沉默。

710
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:28,840
這不是比賽,先生。
當然是他媽的。

711
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:36,680
加油。

712
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:53,880
摩爾斯電碼

713
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:58,159
先生。 來自情報部門的報告。

714
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:00,400
摩爾斯電碼繼續

715
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:15,039
啊,親愛的。

716
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:18,240
終於,我有事要彙報了
這確實是真的。

717
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:24,640
其實他媽的沒錯。

718
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:31,759
截獲的無線電通信

719
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:34,799
德國人之間
和義大利空軍司令部

720
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:37,959
說前天晚上,
48架戰鬥轟炸機

721
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:40,559
戰鬥機被摧毀
在地面上時

722
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:43,279
在兩個獨立的空軍基地——
被出現的男人摧毀

723
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:46,119
顯然不知從何而來
然後消失在沙漠中。

724
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:49,839
此外,還有17輛油罐車,
補給卡車、彈藥箱

725
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:52,519
炸藥被銷毀
在梅爾薩佈雷加。

726
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:56,039
顯然,那些抓住的少數人
攻擊者一瞥

727
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:59,079
說他們沒有穿制服
看起來像野蠻人。

728
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:00,680
所以他還活著。

729
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:08,880
重要的事情
是我的創造是活的。

730
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:17,759
我認為發生了什麼的奧秘
到L支隊第一SAS旅

731
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:19,159
可能已經解決了,先生。

732
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:22,240
嗯,我覺得那個男孩
可能只是贏了他的賭注。

733
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:45,320
鋼琴彈奏簡單的曲調

734
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:07,040
尾巴掉落

735
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:10,360
重新啟動

736
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:39,960
哦,我明白。

737
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:43,520
明白了。

738
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:47,320
音樂:粉碎它
作者:《詛咒》

739
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:51,840
讓遊戲開始吧。

740
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:59,079
# 我們現在一直在哭
太久了

741
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:01,919
# 現在我們要跳舞了
到另一首歌

742
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:06,199
# 我要尖叫和大喊大叫
直到我垂死的呼吸

743
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:09,320
# 我要把它砸碎
直到一無所有

744
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:13,560
#哦,砸碎它！

745
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:16,320
# 砸碎它,砸碎它！

746
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:19,320
#哦,砸碎它！

747
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:21,959
# 砸碎它,砸碎它！

748
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:24,799
# 人們叫我反派
哦,太可惜了

749
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:28,599
# 也許是我的衣服
一定是罪魁禍首

750
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:32,199
# 我什至不在乎我是否看起來一團糟

751
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:35,160
# 不想當傻瓜
像其他人一樣

752
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:39,879
# 哦,砸碎它

753
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:42,280
# 砸碎它,砸碎它！#

754
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,079
We would be a regiment shooting
grouse in their roost in the dark.

755
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:07,199
GUNSHOT
Riley, Almonds.

756
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,759
Remember the parachutes?

757
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,599
Stirling wants to know
if we'll do it again.

758
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:12,999
I'm not asking for anything
other than permission.

759
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,119
And 60 men.

760
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:16,239
Men I will choose according
to my own criteria.

761
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:18,079
Why do you want to fight
in the desert, Dave?

762
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,039
Well, I just want to kill
them fascists, sir.

763
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:22,559
This regiment isn't all Paddies,
is it?

764
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,279
If you decide to join them,
I will join the SAS too.

765
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:28,519
They've been sent to a place
called Kabrit,

766
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:31,119
200 miles behind the German
and Italian lines.

767
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,679
What are their chances of survival?

768
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,239
10%?

769
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,639
This is SAS base camp.

770
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,839
Stopping the advance of fascism
across Africa is now down to us.

771
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,320
God help us.

772
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,240
WIND BLOWS

773
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,800
MILITARY MUSIC

774
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,080
At ease!

775
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,600
Pay the madman. He is the madman!

776
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,479
Here! Do you postmen have a problem
with a wee bit of wind?

777
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,679
Oh, Paddy, shut up.

778
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,639
I'd fly one of these
fuckin' things myself.

779
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,679
Sure it's just a truck
with a lot of ambition.

780
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,879
OK, that's enough.

781
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:55,000
Shouldn't get fucking smart with me.
Step aside.

782
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:03,559
Gentlemen, I understand
your concerns regarding the weather.

783
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,839
This isn't weather.

784
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,759
This is the whole desert
risen up into the air.

785
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,039
General Auchinleck will move
his eighth army

786
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:13,199
against Rommel's front line
in order to relieve Tobruk.

787
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,999
If Tobruk falls...
Tobruk will not fall!

788
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,039
..Cairo and the Suez Canal are next.

789
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:23,159
Malta and the Mediterranean
topple like dominoes.

790
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:27,199
It ends with Rommel rolling
his Panzers up the Mall

791
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,759
towards Buckingham Palace.

792
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:31,519
His planes must not attack
our troops.

793
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:34,039
The SAS have trained for months
to blow them up on the ground.

794
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,759
We will not be stood down.
Many lives depend on us.

795
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,479
It's God's work.

796
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,039
We have one shot at this.

797
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,959
Do you understand? Your job is to
deliver us and turn back.

798
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,999
We will make our own way home.

799
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,159
The wind is 30 knots.

800
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:50,279
15 knots is considered unsafe.

801
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,279
War is fucking unsafe!

802
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,399
OK, enough. Enough. Besides!

803
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,600
Captain Stirling outranks you.

804
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,719
You will have to sleep with your own
conscience if Auchinleck's advance

805
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:07,800
is stopped by air superiority
and Tobruk falls to the enemy.

806
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,240
Get your men boarded.

807
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,120
Good man.

808
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,799
Was that too much?
I think it went rather well.

You said war could be unpleasant.

00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:33,400
Then fortune is with us.
Let's move.

Move where, sir?

The airfields.

921
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:43,120
There are only eight of us, sir.

922
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:48,759
So it'll be harder for them
to see us from the air. Come on.

00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,000
Warm up.

Now, before we proceed,

931
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,199
we need to ascertain
where the airfields are.

932
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:19,039
And to do that, we need to ascertain
where we are.

933
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,599
Riley, I believe you retained
your compass.

934
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,959
All I can say for sure is
that the airfields are on the coast

935
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:28,119
and that we are south of them.

936
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,959
Good.

937
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,440
So we head north.

938
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,960
There are only eight of us...sir.

939
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:41,120
If you make that observation
again...

940
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,880
..there will only be seven of us.

941
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:49,119
I would head north
even if I were alone.

00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,240
Right. We've got work to do.

Do you think
there's a far border town

Somewhere at the desert's edge

945
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,479
The last of the lands we know?

GUNSHOT

947
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:17,400
Some gaunt, eventual
limit of our light

948
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,800
In which I'll find you waiting.

949
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:25,959
And we'll go together
hand in hand again

950
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:29,960
Out there into the wastes
we know not

951
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,400

Oh.

956
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,520
OK.

957
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:23,920
OK.

958
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,960
He landed all gut...
Yes, I understand.

959
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,840
Did you manage to locate
any of the weapons?

00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,320
Found only one machine gun
and six grenades.

961
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,320
No explosives or detonators.

962
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,399
They will all be buried in the sand
on account of the wind.

963
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,639
We'll use your grenades.
You what?

964
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:59,639
We will head north,
that fucking way, up there.

965
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:03,879
And we will reach the coast,
and we will find our airfields.

966
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:06,439
Yeah, well, Paddy, we won't destroy
a single fucking thing

967
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,879
with what we've got, lad. Paddy.

968
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,440
We were going to head south.

969
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:13,319
Sir, there were dark clouds -
it's going to rain.

970
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:16,439
We need to move to a higher ground
before we get washed away.

971
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,999
Right.

972
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,719
This was a fuck-up, yeah?

973
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:22,519
And a grand old fuck-up it was.
Now, if we wipe ourselves out,

974
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:25,119
it will be the only thing
that we ever did, Paddy.

975
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:27,519
They'll say that all we ever did
was fuck up.

976
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:31,719
GHQ will laugh at us.
So your conclusion

977
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,920
is that we should stand down?

978
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,599
Is that it?

979
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,759
Paddy, I didn't mean...

980
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:41,319
Your conclusion, Corporal,
is that we should stand down.

981
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,439
I don't mean nothing by it.
Is that it?

982
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,040
After what they've done to him?
It wasn't them that killed him.

983
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,639
It was the wind and the fall
and our decision,

984
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,440
the decision we all made.

985
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,520
Sorry, sir.

986
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,040
Paddy, we need to be alive
to go again.

987
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,520
So should we move out?

988
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,200
It's rain. Paddy,
we can't leave without you.

989
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,600
It's fine. Go.

990
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,160
I'll catch you up.

991
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,280
Go.

992
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:45,080
Right, gather your belongings
and fuck off.

993
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,080
DISTANT THUNDER

994
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,680
RAIN FALLS

995
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,040
THUNDER CRASHES

996
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,400
Come on, Cooper, get up from there!

997
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,559
Give me your hand.

998
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,479
Do we even know where we're going,
sir?

999
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,680
Of course!

1000
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,880
Jack!

1001
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,199
There's water in the compass.

1002
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,919
Also in the loose bombs.

1003
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:03,639
They're drenched.
Completely useless.

1004
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:07,119
The bombs in our packs are called
Lewes bombs because Lewes is my name

1005
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,039
and I fucking invented them.

1006
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,399
I will decide when they are useless!

1007
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,079
SHOUTING

1008
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,719
Get him out, for God's sake!

1009
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,759
Come on, you're all right.

1010
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:19,920
Unless you want us all to drown,
we must start back.

1011
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,360
Do you know I once swam the Thames?

1012
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,639
From Tower Bridge.

1013
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,719
Just as Julius Caesar
swam the Tiber.

1014
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:34,200
Rest a bit! Jack!

1015
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,559
Look...

1016
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:40,239
the water's turned the desert
into quicksand.

1017
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,519
You can't walk across quicksand,
let alone swim it.

1018
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:48,319
I am not suggesting, Riley,
that I am Julius Caesar,

1019
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:52,000
but like Caesar, my first attempt
at conquest has been thwarted.

1020
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:56,199
Caesar withdrew and came back.

1021
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,879
That is what we will do.

1022
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:00,760
We will go,
but we will come back.

1023
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,439
Yes.

1024
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,120
With certainty.

1025
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,520
Come on, you heard the man. Move!

1026
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,080
WIND WHISTLES

1027
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,080
I can hear singing.

1028
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,160
DISTANT SINGING

1029
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:51,240
SINGING CONTINUES

1030
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:58,079
Now you sing the second verse
in order to reassure them

1031
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,719
that we are not German.

1032
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:03,239
In Kabrit, we officers resolved
a desert procedure.

1033
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:06,199
If you see a fire in the night,
you sing the first verse

1034
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,599
and the people at the fire
sing the second verse.

1035
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:13,160
Because if we were Germans,
we wouldn't know the words.

1036
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,880
Any of you lads know
the second verse?

1037
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,799
No.

1038
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,999
No. Well...

1039
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,999
..if you don't sing it
in the next...30 seconds,

1040
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,840
then the procedure is to open fire.

1041
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:35,239
If Paddy's out there,
it'll be five seconds.

1042
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,440
God, how amusing this all is.

1043
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:44,159
# Hail, hail, the gang's all here

1044
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:47,839
# What the hell do we care?
What the hell do we care?

1045
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,559
# What the hell do we care?

1046
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:53,039
# Hail, hail, the gang's all here

1047
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:56,599
# What the hell do we care?
Now...

1048
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:59,959
# Roll out the barrel

1049
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:03,039
# We'll have a barrel of fun

1050
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:06,919
ALL: # Roll out the barrel
Come on!

1051
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:09,480
# We've got the blues on the run

1052
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,599
# Zing, boom, tararrel

1053
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:17,119
# Sing out a song of good cheer

1054
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:20,799
# Now it's time to roll the barrel

1055
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,920
# For the gang's all here! #

1056
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,760
All right, sir?

1057
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,679
Except the gang is not...

1058
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,559
..all here, is it?

1059
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:41,120
No, the gang is not all here.

1060
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,400
Just us.

1061
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:01,160
MUFFLED CONVERSATION

1062
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,239
There's some, er...

1063
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,960
..tea, Paddy.

1064
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,960
Come on, mate.

1065
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,679
There we are.

1066
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,560
Paddy?

1067
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,080
JAUNTY MUSIC PLAYING

1068
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,919
# A fellow in the forces

1069
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:46,119
# Was writing a letter

1070
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:48,679
# From somewhere in the east

1071
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,679
# Talk of a blinking feast

1072
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:53,159
# He says it's just Blackpool Sands

1073
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,599
# We play with hands grenades

1074
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,399
# If we had known
we would have brought along

1075
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,319
# Our buckets and spades

1076
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:04,879
# Out in the Middle East
You can have a lot of fun

1077
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:09,399
# Out in the Middle East
by the Mediterranean

1078
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,599
# Join the forces,
they used to say

1079
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,839
# And see the world
It sounds OK

1080
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:16,439
# But you see nowt but sand all day

1081
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,839
# Out in the Middle East

1082
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,839
# And when you're hungry

1083
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:22,839
# They never serve you up
some hot pot

1084
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:27,239
# You never get a gentle breeze
a-blowing wind round your whatnot

1085
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,879
# On your heads you've hats
like saucepan lids

1086
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:32,199
# You take off your
well-I-never-dids

1087
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,399
# It gets a bit hot... #

1088
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,599
Looks like our passengers
have arrived.

1089
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,999
I thought there were 55 of them.

1090
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,319
Don't worry.

1091
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,720
You'll still be paid
if you drive home empty.

1092
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,520
Mm.

1093
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:54,720
Long Range Desert Group!
Identify yourself.

1094
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,120
Cooper.

1095
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:06,280
We are L Detachment,
First Special Air Service Brigade.

1096
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,880
What's left of us.

1097
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,359
Maybe it's your attitude.

1098
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,399
Maybe it's the way you walk.

1099
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,320
But you are walking on a tightrope.

1100
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,919
This is a big desert,

1101
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:29,239
but there is no room in it

1102
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:33,239
for realists or pragmatists

1103
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:35,480
or believers in common sense.

1104
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:43,280
Last night was the first uncertain
step on the long walk to glory.

1105
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:49,320
There is no other narrative.

1106
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:04,519
That's it, old boy, come on.

1107
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,959
What happened?

1108
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:08,719
We experienced some weather.
Ah, yes.

1109
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,119
Are you in charge here?

1110
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:12,840
The desert's in charge here.
Maybe you've learned that, sir.

1111
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:25,239
What news of Tobruk?
We've been away from radio.

1112
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:30,599
Come on. Get a nice bath,
drink a beer, or two, or three,

1113
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:33,960
and then we'll talk about Tobruk.
Come on.

1114
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,160
Another fuck-up?

1115
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,440
Another fuck-up.

1116
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:47,639
But anyway, we run the rickshaws
into town.

1117
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:50,119
How many more can we expect?

1118
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,839
Ah, well...

1119
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,359
..the weather we experienced
was very bad, sir.

1120
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:55,719
Yes.

1121
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,160
Perhaps not many.

1122
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:00,839
Right. And, er...

1123
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,960
how long do you want to wait?

1124
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,800
Oh, you know.

1125
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,160
Forever.

1126
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,440
Mm.

1127
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:15,239
No. I don't like waiting around.

1128
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,839
I have a poker game in Cairo
on Thursdays.

1129
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,040
SHOUTS: We have some cattle
to round up.

1130
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,159
Let's go, boys. Come on.
On your feet.

1131
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,200
Come on!

1132
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,320

How the hell are you going to
find them in this vastness?

1148
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,439
In the desert, everything
can be predicted.

1149
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,639
You were dropped in the north quad,
number 12.

1150
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,199
Then rain came.

1151
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,719
Rising flood sends your boys
on to high ground.

1152
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:48,039
The Platypus Ridge,
which runs south,

1153
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:50,840
so they walk south
until the ridge splits.

1154
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,920
Fuck off back there.

1155
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,960
Ha-ha!

1156
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,000
Come on!

1157
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,959
Then they reach the oasis,

1158
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:08,480
which even the Brits can see
on account of the vegetation.

1159
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,680
Come on!

1160
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,839
Then they follow
the dried-up riverbed south

1161
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:18,239
until they arrive...

1162
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,640
..right just about...

1163
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,560
..now. Round about there.

1164
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:42,199
Looks like I will make
my poker game.

1165
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,200
# I'm in the mood

1166
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,440
# The rhythm is right

00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,839
# Move to the music... #

1168
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:56,040
I only count eight of our men.

1169
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,160
22 survivors out of...

1170
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,959
..55.

1171
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:06,719
Not a shot fired,
except a damn good soldier

1172
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,480
firing into his own brain.

1173
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:14,600
Not a plane destroyed, not
a fucking detonator detonated.

1174
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,560
What will GHQ do?

1175
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,360
About what?

1176
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:24,919
Nothing happened.
Our mission was never authorised,

1177
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,839
so no-one will know.

1178
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:29,399
There are a few at GHQ that do know,
and they will laugh.

1179
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,679
But...

1180
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:33,839
..mostly they will be too busy
losing the war to care.

1181
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:37,640
And we will be stood down
when we get back to Cairo.

1182
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,359
Yes.

1183
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,960
If we go back.

1184
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:50,519
They say the boys
from the Long Range Desert Group

1185
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:54,239
can find a pencil
in 1,000 square miles of desert

1186
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:57,199
just so long as it casts a shadow.

1187
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:00,839
They can find a downed pilot
in an area the size of England

1188
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:03,240
in the middle of the night
in a sandstorm.

1189
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,719
So?

1190
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,400
So...I wonder...

1191
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:14,039
..if they can find the SAS
a place of sanctuary.

1192

I come here to relax.

1198
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,039
I thought it was time for us
to update each other

1199
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,759
on some recent events.

Your office was locked.

1201

Recent events? General de Gaulle
needs to be kept informed

1202
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,520
of British strategies
in North Africa.

1203

French 75.

1204
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:13,519
Tell me, what is the general's
main concern at the moment?

1205
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:14,919
Fuck you.

1206
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,679
Where are they?

1207
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:19,479
Do you mean where are they?

1208
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,160
Or where is he?

1209
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,119
Do you want to have dinner?

1210
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:28,359
No. Just tell me where they are.

1211
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:31,680
No-one is saying anything.
For Cairo, that is unusual.

1212
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,679
CLEARS THROAT
Well, truth is,

1213
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,319
no-one knows where they are.

1214
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:40,759
Any survivors should have
reported back two weeks ago.

1215
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:43,359
We've had no communications
of any sort.

1216
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,279
What happened to them?

1217
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:48,239
Well, before you begin to imagine
some heroic combat,

1218
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,599
it's almost certain
that if they are all dead,

1219
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:53,639
they weren't killed by the Germans
or the Italians.

1220
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,359
They were killed by the desert.

1221
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,400
The wind, the sand, the thorns.

1222
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,679
Oh, and by the reckless decision

1223
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,999
taken by our friend
and his comrades

1224
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,519
because they couldn't stand
to lose face.

1225
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:09,199
They decided to take off
and make a parachute drop at night

1226
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:12,079
in the middle of
a fucking sandstorm.

1227
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:14,960
What is it about Stirling
that you dislike so much?

1228
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:20,680
I invented the SAS.

1229
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:26,039
And he had no right to destroy it
on its first mission.

1230
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:28,279
And if it's not destroyed,
it's now a laughing stock

1231
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,280
among the few people
who even know it exists.

1232
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:34,039
In terms of percentage,
I'm afraid the chances of Stirling

1233
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:36,879
being still alive
are just this side of zero.

1234
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:40,079
I thought you knew the rules
of engagement in time of war.

1235
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,479
Fucking is fine.

1236
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,200
Feeling is not.

1237
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,880
MUSIC PLAYING

1238
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:13,759
Now, then.

1239
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,399
This, my friends, is Jalo.

1240
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,999
Literally, unquestionably,

1241
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,719
undeniably the middle
of fucking nowhere.

1242
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:25,799
If fucking nowhere had
a capital city, this would be it.

1243
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:29,199
And this would be the main street
of fucking nowhere city.

1244
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:33,159
And the Lord Mayor would be fucking
no-one, presiding over fuck all

1245
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:36,359
in a place where there was no-one
around to give a fuck.

1246
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:39,880
Which is exactly what you asked for,
Captain Stirling, am I right?

1247
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,879
We could carry on driving,
but I'd say this place

1248
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:46,479
is as good as any other part
of nowhere we might find.

1249
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,839
How far to the German airfield?

1250
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:51,239
Sirte is 350 miles north-west.

1251
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,839
The Allied front line?

1252
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:55,439
The first Allied position
you'd come to

1253
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:59,399
is the New Zealand Reserve troop,
80 miles across open desert.

1254
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,479
But the Kiwi fighting men
have been sent north,

1255
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:03,639
so the camp is empty.

1256
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:05,319
If you need any help,
there isn't any.

1257
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:08,239
The New Zealand camp is empty,
you say?

1258
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,199
A few wounded, a few guards.

1259
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:12,999
And a few empty trucks,
one might imagine.

1260
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,239
Maybe some guns they left behind.

1261
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:16,719
Maybe some ammunition.

1262
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,359
Will there be a piano?

1263
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,399
A fucking piano?

1264
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:24,199
The capital city of fucking nowhere
will do us just fine.

1265
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:27,640
But first, we need to do
a spot of shopping.

1266
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,760
Come on, you dishy bastard.

1267

00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:07,119
# ..and it feels so bad

1277
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:09,240
# Guess my race is run

1278
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:13,679
# She's the best girl
that I ever had

1279
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:16,639
# I fought the law and the law won

1280
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,640
# I fought the law and the

1281
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:28,679
# I fought the law and the law won

1282
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:32,199
# I fought the law and the law won

1283
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:35,559
# I fought the law and the law won

1284
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:38,759
HORNS BLARE
# I fought the law and the law won

1285
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:42,079
# I fought the law and the law won

1286
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:44,999
# I fought the law and the... #
THEY CHEER

1287
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,960
Philips! Sentry duty.
On the tower, one hour.

1288
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:54,319
And if you can, perhaps you might
bury the explosive canisters

1289
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,800
to keep them out of the direct heat.

1290
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:59,079
Where can I put the piano?

1291
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:01,320
You play the piano, Paddy? No.

1292
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,559
Eoin was trying to teach me.

1293
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:07,080
I want to carry on.

1294
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,719
Put it in the mess hall.

1295
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,239
There isn't a mess hall.

1296
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,760
So build one.

1297
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,999
Seekings? Yes, boss.

1298
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,839
Now, last night
was rather a success,

1299
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,519
so we have something to celebrate.

1300
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,239
What did you steal
by way of drinks?

1301
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:25,719
45 gallons of New Zealand rum, sir.

1302
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,079
Good boy. Right.

1303
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:29,919
So by the time that we're unpacked,
it will be cocktail hour.

1304
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,279
And then when we've had our
cocktails and the sun is set,

1305
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:34,040
I think we should go for
a bit of jolly.

1306
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:38,959
Ammunition will be signed in
by Lieutenant Fraser.

1307
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:42,160
Unless he has a problem with that.
No, sir.

1308
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:46,239
Refuel your vehicles, Mr Sadler.

1309
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,559
We go tonight.

1310
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:48,959
MUSIC: Wheels of Steel
by Saxon

1311
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,839
Get the tents up.
Let's not be too creative!

1312
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,400
Call me Mike.

1313
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:01,719
Targets will be given on the coast.

1314
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:05,159
Ten Lewes bombs to each man.
At the ready!

1315
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:09,839
Have your ten-minute fuses
and your 30-minute fuses.

1316
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:14,199
Do not use your bombs until you can
smell the Messerschmitts!

1317
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:18,119
SAS mission number one!

1318
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:20,519
Move out, you fucking virgins.

1319
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:22,000
Come on, Bob.

1320
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:33,600
# She's got mean wheels of steel

1321
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,320
# She's got

1322
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,560
# Wheels of steel

1323
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,120
# Wheels of steel

1324
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,880
# Talkin' about my wheels of steel

1325
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,880
# Wheels of steel.. #

1326
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:58,799
We are ten miles outside of
Sirte airstrip, directly north.

1327
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,039
I'm going to pick three men,
take them there,

1328
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,559
and do what damage I can.

1329
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:05,359
Lewes, you will take your men
to Mersa Brega.

1330
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:08,159
Your target is fuel trucks
and supply trucks.

1331
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,839
Paddy, you will take your men
to Tamet Airstrip.

1332
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:14,279
Your target is Italian Caproni
fighter bombers and Messerschmitts.

1333
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:17,520
Bill Fraser, where are you?
I'm here. Come on.

1334
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:25,599
I hear during the fuck-up
that you repeatedly asked questions

1335
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,200
of your commanding officer.

1336
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:33,479
Well, we have decided, in order
to avoid further fuck-ups,

1337
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:36,839
that questions are to be welcomed
in the SAS.

1338
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:40,160
You will pick four men
and travel to Agedabia.

1339
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:47,359
If questions are welcome, sir,
I've got a question. Yes?

1340
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,439
Can me the boys have some rum?
Oh, absolutely.

1341
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,279
Please. Come on.

1342
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:55,279
Right. We rendezvous back here
tomorrow morning.

1343
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,759
You and your drivers wait here
for our return.

1344
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,239
With all due respect, sir,

1345
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:01,439
I'm fucking sick of being
the taxi service.

1346
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:04,040
I can read this desert better
than any man here.

1347
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:08,519
Well, if it's action
that you're after,

1348
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:10,000
go with Paddy Mayne.

1349
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:13,439
We have a second chance.

1350
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:16,239
Let's see what the stars
have in store for us, shall we?

1351
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,920
MEN CHEER

1352
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:20,920
SHOUTS ORDERS

1353
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:01,200
It's empty.

1354
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:05,080
They've all flown.

1355
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:08,440
Shit.

1356
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,960
Prime fuses. Ten minutes.

1357
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:52,120
Go.

1358
00:43:56,600 --> 00:44:00,719
Riley. Take one man,
go to the right.

1359
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:03,360
Almonds, take three men,
flank round from the rear.

1360
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:06,359
Back here in eight minutes.

1361
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:09,280
Hit as many trucks as you can.
For God's sake, don't be seen.

1362
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:13,160
Go.

1363
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:42,359
Sadler. Huh?

1364
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:45,639
This is a famous Lewes bomb.

1365
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:47,279
Never heard of it.

1366
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:50,119
That's because it's only famous
amongst us.

1367
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:52,879
Jock Lewes invented it.

1368
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:54,639
He cooked us up a prototype.

1369
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:56,639
Tonight, we're going to
try them out.

1370
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:58,119
You've never used them before?

1371
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:00,479
No, but Jock Lewes is very smart.

1372
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:02,000
I'm sure we'll be fine.

1373
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:07,359
These are all being primed and ready
to go off in ten minutes, right?

1374
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:08,439
From now?

1375
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:09,800
From now.

1376
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:13,839
So we should fucking
get on with it, Paddy.

1377
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:15,599
Ten minutes is plenty of time, boys.

1378
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:16,960
Plenty of time for what?

1379
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:21,280
DISTANT LAUGHTER AND CHATTER

1380
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:26,279
They're drunk, Paddy.

1381
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:28,639
We could blow the bombs
and be gone before they know...

1382
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:32,000
Low-hanging fruit, ripe apples.

1383
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:38,679
Those drunks are pilots
and engineers when they sober up.

1384
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:42,319
So to fuck with conventions,
Geneva or otherwise.

1385
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:44,239
This is our fucking work, boys.

1386
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:47,440
This is who we are,
to kill and be killed.

1387
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:54,799
Any man too just and good and noble
for work like this can stay behind,

1388
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:57,080
polish their bullets,
make a nice wee necklace.

1389
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:02,280
Myself, I am tranquil.

1390
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:06,560
I never go to parties
to which I am invited anyway.

1391

00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:52,680
Paddy!

1438
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:01,640
THEY WHOOP

1439
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:06,119
Get back to those Jeeps.

1440
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:08,159
Paddy, hurry up!

1441
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:09,319
Paddy!

Boys.

1456
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:59,120
THEY LAUGH

1457
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:06,479
That's Mersa Brega and Agedabia
blown to hell, sir.

1458
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:08,080
Yes!

LAUGHS

1462

And here am I in the dark
and silence in Sirte.

1463
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:28,840
It's not a competition, sir.
Of course it fucking is.

1464
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:36,680
Come on.

1465
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:53,880
MORSE CODE

1466
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:58,159
Sir. Report from intelligence.

1467
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:00,400
MORSE CODE CONTINUES

1468
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:15,039
Ah, my dear.

1469
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:18,240
At last, I have something to report
that's actually true.

1470
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:24,640
Actually fucking true.

1471
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:31,759
Intercepted radio communications

1472
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:34,799
between the German
and Italian Air Force commands

1473
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:37,959
says that the night before last,
48 fighter bombers

1474
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:40,559
and fighter aircraft were destroyed
while on the ground

1475
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:43,279
at two separate air bases -
destroyed by men who appeared

1476
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:46,119
apparently from nowhere
and disappeared into the desert.

1477
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:49,839
Also, 17 fuel tankers,
supply trucks, ammunition crates

1478
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:52,519
and explosives were destroyed
at Mersa Brega.

1479
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:56,039
Apparently, those few who caught
a glimpse of the attackers

1480
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:59,079
said they wore no uniforms
and looked like wild savages.

1481
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:00,680
So he's alive.

1482
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:08,880
The important thing
is that my creation is alive.

1483
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:17,759
I think the mystery of what happened
to L Detachment First SAS Brigade

1484
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:19,159
may have been solved, sir.

1485
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:22,240
Well, I think that boy
might just have won his bet.

1486
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:45,320

1502
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:28,599
# Maybe its my clothes
