1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,999
我不要求任何東西
除許可外。

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,279
還有60名男子。我會選擇的男人
根據我自己的標準。

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:09,760
如果你決定加入他們,我會
也加入 SAS。

4
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:13,159
最親愛的米倫,你知道我愛你。

5
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:14,879
我知道我可以讓你這麼開心。

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,440
如果你出門,
這將是自殺。

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,920
誰？麥戈尼格爾,先生。

8
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:28,159
斯特林是怎麼回事
你這麼不喜歡？

9
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,359
我發明瞭SAS。

10
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:33,839
他無權毀滅
它執行了第一次任務。

11
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,479
我們還有第二次機會。

12
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:38,319
讓我們看看星星是什麼
為我們準備了。

13
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,639
槍雞巴

14
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,200
機槍射擊

15
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,879
那是帕迪·梅恩...

16
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,439
我在黑暗中
和沉默...

17
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,439
這不是比賽,先生。

18
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,759
當然是。

19
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:55,880
哦,我明白。
讓遊戲開始吧。

20
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:21,040
音樂:遊戲
作者:摩托黑德

21
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,840
狂笑

22
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,480
來吧,抓住他。

23
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,320
你覺得這些怎麼樣？

24
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,200
你到底從哪裡學的
像那樣開車,帕迪梅恩？

25
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:37,559
現在,我們將分成四個
單位和以前一樣。

26
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,679
我猜是同一個團隊
就像我們上次攻擊一樣

27
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:44,479
這些相同的簡易機場,只是為了保持
評分系統公平？

28
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,879
不。

29
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,439
不同的團隊,相同的團隊領導者。

30
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,279
因為這整個練習,
整個北非戰役

31
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,599
是關於我的團隊與你的團隊,
水稻。

32
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,359
贊成。
只要清楚就行。

33
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,199
先生們,這是一個劇院
戰爭,不是遊樂場。

34
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,559
而這次會有所不同,
因為現在德國人

35
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,999
都在期待我們。

36
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,439
每個簡易機場都將處於高位
警報。

37
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,920
更有趣,喬克。

38
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:11,919
所以現在也許是雙點

39
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,200
每摧毀一架飛機？

40
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,599
劉易斯,你會拿杏仁
和萊利到諾菲利亞簡易機場。

41
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,079
弗雷澤。。。我不要
參與這個愚蠢的遊戲。

42
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,839
..你會和路易斯一起去,
但是帶四個人休息

43
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,999
在簡易機場進行攻擊
西邊的機場。

44
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,599
而帕迪,就像上次一樣,

45
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:35,040
你會帶走塔梅特,我會帶走
蘇爾特。

46
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,799
那麼第二回合,先生。

47
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,799
哦,是的,第二輪。

48
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,319
那麼,先生,我可以加入您的團隊嗎？

49
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,839
當然可以,親愛的,
你堅持和帕迪叔叔在一起。

50
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,079
哦,她是一隻敏銳的小貓。
她是。

51
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:51,479
誰破壞最多
今晚的飛機將贏得一瓶

52
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:56,959
20 年單一麥芽威士卡
蘇格蘭威士卡！

53
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,840
歡呼

54
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,560
哦,我父親的最愛。

55
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:07,639
現在,我隨身攜帶以防萬一
我受了致命傷。

56
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:11,800
現在,我把它作為獎品提供
在我們的遊戲中。

57
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,759
帕迪,你有很多
你那個時代的威士卡。

58
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,439
沒有什麼比這更好的了,

59
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,239
考慮到你卑微的背景。

60
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,199
我能站在你們兩個之間嗎
他媽的

61
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,840
像校長這樣的白癡？

62
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,800
我自己,我更喜歡鍋,蒸餾
在浴缸裡。

63
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,680
但我很樂意接受這個
當我贏了,先生,請你動手。

64
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,720
好吧,夥計們,檢查一下你們的武器。

65
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,320
噴槍上膛

66
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,079
大衛。

67
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,960
這是什麼愚蠢的廢話
關於遊戲？

68
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:57,639
沒有指揮官曾經
能夠控制帕迪·梅恩

69
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,319
因為他們都不理解他。
他會和我爭戰

70
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,119
無論發生什麼。

71
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:05,759
但現在,他會努力留住
通過消滅敵人來佔據主導地位

72
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:10,319
飛機,這是必不可少的
如果我們不想讓托布魯克倒下。

73
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,599
是的,但它真的很聰明嗎
戰略,大衛,還是做

74
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,240
你只是想贏得比賽？

75
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,439
現在 幾點鐘？十分鐘到
午夜。

76
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,360
我們需要等待月亮落山。

77
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,519
讓我們在這裡等待月亮落山。

78
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,839
四英里到簡易機場。這
海岸路是

79
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,639
就在那個山脊上。

80
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:10,679
我們不能拿車輛冒險
任何進一步。

81
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,160
去他媽的月亮。

82
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,960
你來了,先生。
我們走吧。

83
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,440
遠方的聲音

84
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,279
厚顏無恥的混蛋已經忍受了
圍欄。

85
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,679
哎呀,厚臉皮的狐狸。

86
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,359
但它會讓它更有趣
這一次。

87
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:59,159
我認為我們應該等待月亮
解決 - 他們會看到我們。

88
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,999
不,月亮是我們的朋友。

89
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,640
耐心是我們的敵人。

90
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,280
此外,
那些看到我們的人很快就會死去。

91
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,720
聽。。。

92
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,440
低沉的隆隆聲

93
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,480
正如我想的那樣,柵欄
這次還有探照燈。

94
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,079
好吧。

95
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,880
我希望你讀這個。

96
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,840
在。。。

97
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,759
..我不信教,先生。

98
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,439
如果您無法閱讀列印件,

99
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:15,319
光線將足夠
對我們移動不利。

100
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,480
遞給我,這是我的最愛。

101
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,519
而且,呃,你在做什麼,先生？

102
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,439
我們至少還有15分鐘。

103
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,440
所以你讀你的聖經。

104
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,680
我要以我自己的方式祈禱。

105
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,040
低低的輕笑

106
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,919
我最親愛的米倫,

107
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:03,319
我發送已經兩周了
你我的求婚信。

108
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,639
我在想像我沒有
收到回復

109
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,719
由於郵件中的故障
服務。

110
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,639
我們現在以火星為基地。

111
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,240
郵件每藍月亮來一次。

112
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:19,199
說到月亮,每次
我看著它,我想起你。

113
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,800
太老套了,不是嗎？喜歡一個
那些糟糕的好萊塢電影。

114
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:27,040
她笑了

115
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:35,399
但月亮給了我希望
那東西如此寒冷和遙遠

116
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,280
可以顯得美麗。

117
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:46,599
我相信我也被認為是冷的
和一些人的遠端,我希望

118
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,719
你也可以考慮
我,如果不是美麗的,

119
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,680
那麼至少是可靠的。

120
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,000
我希望你的回答
我的建議將是肯定的。

121
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:07,640
光剛死
“你不要殺人”,先生。

122
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:16,559
好吧,我可以告訴你完整的
誡命 - 你不可殺人,

123
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,159
除非在一個很好的事業中。

124
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:22,159
每天,希特勒都派無辜者
到死為止。

125
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,240
所以我們有一個很好的理由。

126
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,399
弗雷澤。

127
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,919
帶你的人向西走。

128
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,159
我們向東走。

129
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,320
走得好,先生。

130
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,959
祝你好運,男孩們。

131
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,800
發動機修訂版

132
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,960
麥克,麥克...

133
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:00,800
德軍增援部隊正朝著
加入隆美爾。

134
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:05,840
我們無法到達蘇爾特簡易機場
沒有穿過那條路。

135
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,800
他媽的！

136
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,600
畫刀

137
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,560
德國之聲

138
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,000
公雞槍

139
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,519
悶悶的尖叫聲

140
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,160
刀斬

141
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:03,679
只有五個梅塞施密特在
帶。什麼意思？

142
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,159
五就是五。

143
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,679
五個梅塞施密特被取出
行動

144
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,240
挽救了英國人的生命。

145
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,759
狗屎

146
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,439
是的,先生。

147
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,759
我只希望有更多。

148
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:19,479
他們不在乎分數
黑板,我們誰都沒有。

149
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,119
好。

150
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,240
只有怪物會計數。

151
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,719
如果這是隆美爾的主要解脫
列,會有

152
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,519
三人間歇
小時。會有休息時間。

153
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:46,519
德軍緊緊逼
防止。。。會有血腥的
休息,薩德勒！

154
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,959
我會休息一下。

155
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,840
我他媽的欠休息一下！

# 生來就要輸

161
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,639
# 生來就要輸

162
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:27,280
# 寶貝我生來就要失去...#

163
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,280
狗屎

164
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,320
守衛喊叫

165
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,520
壞狗。

166
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,560
看起來帕迪點燃了另一個
篝火。

167
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,400
那麼,現在。他他媽的有什麼
炸了？

168
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:04,999
不管是什麼,我想有
對目的地幾乎沒有疑問

169
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,799
我父親最喜歡的威士卡。

170
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,320
笑聲

171
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,400
我父親會非常自豪。

172
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,719
就是這樣,道路暢通無阻。
這是最後一個。

173
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,519
現在 幾點鐘？

174
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:23,360
4:26 4:40 太陽升起。這是另一個
20分鐘行軍到蘇爾特簡易機場。

175
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,520
歎息:太晚了。

176
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,520
遙遠的轟隆隆

177
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,079
看起來像路易斯和弗雷澤
也取得了一些成功。

178
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,639
勇敢！

179
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,280
勇敢！

180
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,479
答案是肯定的。
答案是肯定的。

181
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,599
道路變得清晰起來
當已經太晚了。

182
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,679
或者想像一個更有趣的
可能性。

183
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:53,599
道路變得清晰起來
因為為時已晚。

184
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,160
這其中蘊藏著一個至關重要的哲學
分別。

185
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:07,999
荷馬在《伊利亞特》中寫道:
命運與我們同生。

186
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,920
沒有人能逃脫它,也沒有
勇敢的人也不是懦夫。

187
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,720
你說什麼,薩德勒？

188
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,640
當他說話時,我說不
勇敢或怯懦。

189
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,560
事實上。

190
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,440
根本沒有人在說話。

191
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,799
何屁

192
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,960
如果你看到一塊棕色的石頭,羅格,
遠離它。

193
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,120
斯特林！

194
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,440
我們做到了。

195
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,840
我想寫下分數。

196
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,320
你為什麼不不管它,帕迪？

197
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,840
拜託,24加27...

198
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,400
50...

199
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,359
..1.

200
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,480
嚇跑傑裡斯,那個。

201
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:35,559
即使他們拿了額外的
注意事項,我認為

202
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,839
我們做得很好。

203
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:42,719
電線,狗,睜大眼睛,
儘管男孩。

204
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,359
是什麼導致了所有的煙花？

205
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,559
5,000加侖航空燃料。

206
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,519
啊。

207
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,719
我在我的統計中沒有算在內。

208
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,919
你呢？

209
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,960
誰會得到威士卡？

210
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,600
獎品不見了,帕迪。

211
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:07,040
有些我喝了,其餘的
被打成碎片。

212
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,080
決定這是一個毫無價值的姿態。

213
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:17,279
我的策略是醜陋而徒勞的,
一瓶威士卡不是

214
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,399
合適的獎勵
為了足智多謀和勇氣

215
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,239
你已經展示了兩個以上
非常危險的任務。

216
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,680
所以。。。

217
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:31,319
..我要推薦給GHQ
你被授予

218
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:36,679
傑出服務勳章
獎章和你得到晉陞

219
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,680
到上尉軍銜。

220
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,199
恭喜你,梅恩船長。

221
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:52,639
特種航空服務第一
戰鬥勳章和首次晉陞。

222
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:57,280
為帕迪船長歡呼三聲
梅恩,塔梅特的瘋狂混蛋
帶！

223
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,879
嘻嘻...
萬歲！

224
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,479
嘻嘻...萬歲！

225
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,839
現在你可以嘗試穿披風了
你自己的力量,

226
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,560
你這個叛變的愛爾蘭屄。

227
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,240
你看你...

228
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:16,880
你是第一任指揮官
我曾經真正喜歡過。

229
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,400
哼。

230
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,440
劉易斯到底在哪裡？

231
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,960
米倫？

232
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,000
米倫？

233
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,719
她輕笑

234
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,079
你在幹什麼？

235
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,479
我在問我親愛的逝者
祖母問。

236
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,160
什麼問題？

237
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,919
你很神秘。

238
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,679
我們要去哪？

239
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,400
我祖母說是的。

240
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,799
所以讓我們去做吧。

241
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,640
在車後座！

242
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,960
這是所有年輕人
顯然,在美國是這樣。

243
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,879
呃......

244
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,440
她咯咯地笑

245
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,559
記住,你必須退出。

246
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,959
我會的,我的愛人。

247
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,520
我會的。

248
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,360
兩人都呻吟

249
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,720
我愛你,米倫。

250
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,760
呻吟

251
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:09,479
哦！

252
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,959
哦,哦,主啊！

253
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,159
什麼？

254
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:16,239
很快,看在上帝的份上。
我們該怎麼辦？

255
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,399
喜歡這個？是的,更快。

256
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,319
哦！

257
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,400
哦！善良。

258
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,999
這麼多！

259
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,760
他清了清嗓子

260
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,040
哦！

261
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:41,359
什麼？現在你毀了？

262
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,040
我的衣服被毀了。

263
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,360
嗯,米倫...

264
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,719
當我們結婚時,那裡
將不需要

265
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,600
用於戰略撤退。

266
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,600
你總是訴諸軍事術語
當你感到尷尬時。

267
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,760
你聽到我說話了嗎？

268
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,080
我說,當我們結婚的時候。

269
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,960
哦,喬克...

270
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,600
敵機,正南！

271
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:22,439
飛機無人機

272
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:25,160
大家,扇出去。小心！

273
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,239
杏仁,前往岩石。

274
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,039
大家都出去了。扇出！

275
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:58,079
拿起你的武器,掩護。
拿布倫槍。

276
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,279
散射！

277
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,880
大家散開！

278
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,919
下來吧,先生,還有另一個
飛機！顯然是自己做的

279
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:09,079
優先事項,如何
奉承。

280
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:11,559
杏仁,掩護。加油。

281
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,360
滾開！

282
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,280
他嘟囔著

283
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,919
喊

284
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,680
你被擊中了嗎,先生？

285
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,039
他們正在向後擺動。

286
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:47,599
鴨！你還好嗎,先生？

287
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,799
只是前往岩石。

288
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,840
我會在那裡見到你。

289
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,799
先生,你必須跑,跑。

290
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:58,640
跑？步行將是一件好事。

291
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,160
先生！你沒事吧？

292
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,040
呻吟

293
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,120
呼嚕 聲

294
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,920
喊叫,槍聲

295
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,920
先生！

296
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,880
您需要説明嗎？

297
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,600
呻吟

298
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,879
我們會來接你的。

299
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,359
回到岩石後面！

300
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:24,160
他們又來了！

301
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,480
呼嚕 聲

302
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:10,280
鳥兒鳴叫

303
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,280
運動員。

304
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
為了回答你的提議,我的
愛。。。

305
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,400
..我真的不得不說不。

306
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,320
我怎麼能嫁給一個男人
已經死了？

307
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,119
他嘟囔著

308
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,839
不。

309
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,280
不不不

310
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,080
不,米倫。

311
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,199
不。

312
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,480
不,我沒死。

313
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:04,320
我還活著。米倫...

314
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:08,000
我沒死,米倫！

315
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:37,519
我一會兒就和你在一起。

316
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:40,079
我盡可能快。

317
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,159
運動員！先生,你受傷了。

318
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,199
我來找你。

319
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:47,520
不要去那裡,那是
他媽的命令。我不會讓你
這。

320
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,760
喊

321
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:54,000
先生,我來了。

322
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,120
快到了,親愛的。

323
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,639
飛機無人機

324
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,440
炮火

325
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,479
只有一輛車。

326
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:25,040
我想知道德國人是否
有一塊黑板。

327
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:48,160
大家沒事吧,小夥子們？

328
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,920
你們沒事吧,夥計們？

329
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,080
給他們喝一杯。

330
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,840
喬克沒有成功。

331
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,839
什麼意思？

332
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,360
你是什麼意思？

333
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,279
你覺得我是什麼意思？

334
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:34,520
不。他在哪？

335
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,719
他他媽的死了。

336
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,200
嘿 嘿。。

337
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:46,599
他在哪？！

338
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,479
他就是他跌倒的地方。

339
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,279
你離開了他？

340
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:52,040
我離開了他...！

341
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:57,520
這就是他媽的協定！

342
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:01,960
你,按照你他媽的命令。

343
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:07,519
不要試圖檢索
墮落者的屍體

344
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:10,680
“因為它會阻礙迅速執行
給定任務“,先生。

345
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:27,120
他是一個血腥的爛攤子,在陽光下。

346
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,799
這就是我們在哪裡

347
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:33,319
現在都會
傑瑞在我們身上。

348
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:35,120
斯特林葛籣茨

349
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:01,480
我其實不相信
約翰·路易斯是人。

350
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:07,400
先生,熄滅你的香煙。

351
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:11,520
先生,熄滅你的香煙。
滾開！

352
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,320
滾開！

353
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,960
他死得很好。

354
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:48,320
沙子,沙子,快。

355
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,720
所以。。。

356
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:24,600
..只有夢想家
瘋子離開了。

357
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,120
他媽的會是誰
現在明智的人？

358
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:14,559
親愛的喬克,我收到了你的信
今天早上,我跳了舞。

359
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:17,519
我居然和信一起跳舞
在我的手裡,好像是

360
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,480
你我和你一起跳舞。

361
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,079
我當然會嫁給你,喬克。

362
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,760
我當然會。

363
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:53,960
遊行。

364
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,879
遊行。

365
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,200
注意力。

366
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,359
早上,先生們。

367
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,879
所有人:早上,先生。

368
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,679
他說:「早上好,先生們。

369
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:06,159
早上好,先生！

370
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,959
就像他媽的小學一樣。

371
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,440
放鬆。

372
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:14,279
好吧,如果這是小學,

373
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:17,599
我有消息
來自校長,

374
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,479
奧金萊克將軍本人。

375
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:23,520
但在我告訴之前
你他要說什麼...

376
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:28,760
..哀悼期
因為喬克·路易斯中尉結束了。

377
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,479
庫 珀

378
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,840
升旗。先生！

379
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:41,999
奧金萊克表示他的
對成功的驚訝

380
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,759
我們在這樣的成就
時間很短。

381
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:47,679
摧毀了90架敵機
三周后,

382
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:50,679
我們已經超過了這個數位
被英國皇家空軍摧毀

383
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:53,359
三倍。他媽的！

384
00:35:53,360 --> 00:36:00,559
帕迪·梅恩的DSO一直是
確認並已晉陞

385
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,920
到上尉軍銜。先生？

386
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,639
它不起作用。

387
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,639
對,尋求,

388
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,719
現在説明那個可憐的孩子。

389
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,200
他媽的很高興,先生。

390
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:16,519
輝盛榮獲獎項
軍事十字勳章。

391
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:18,959
繩子被鉤住了,是嗎？
是的。

392
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,639
我已經晉陞為軍銜
的專業。

393
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:25,639
我們做了...我認為
是輪子。是他媽的
繩子,你嘖嘖。

394
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:27,439
嘿,這樣跟我說話,

395
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:30,800
我會把你的出血塊打掉！
那麼,繼續！他媽的清酒！

396
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:44,599
從大局來看,

397
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:49,559
逆境而上,我們現在
有主動權。

398
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:54,319
這種成功是沒有感謝的
你的工作一小部分,

399
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:58,199
SAS的人已經執行了。

400
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:04,159
我們之所以取得成功,是因為我們做到了
事情不同。

401
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:08,079
我們以自己的方式實現我們的目標。

402
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:10,679
去他媽的輪子。
去他媽的繩索。

403
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:12,640
就把他媽的東西綁起來。

404
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:21,999
表彰你的驚奇
成功,GHQ

405
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,479
五天都獎勵了你
離開。

406
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:28,919
我們可能不是正式團,
但是當你走自己的路時

407
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:34,559
到你在開羅的酒吧和妓院,
你們都會穿一個

408
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:39,799
其中 - 鮑勃·泰特的帽子徽章。

409
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:44,119
火焰之劍是傳說中的
劍神劍。

410
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,560
新的跳躍翅膀。

411
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,080
它們是由喬克設計的。

412
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,839
你們這些能讀書的人,
將閱讀座右銘

413
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,359
在我們的徽章上。

414
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:57,839
現在,帕迪,既然你已經體現了
最好的話,我會離開

415
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:00,519
給你說。

416
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:04,079
新的座右銘
的特別航空服務是 -

417
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:09,040
喝朗姆酒,打臟,操
規則。

418
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:19,120
新的座右銘是「誰敢贏」。

419
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:24,200
誰敢...贏了。

420
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:28,240
我們將繼續敢於。

421
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:36,319
有卡車
在帶你們去開羅的路上。

422
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:41,239
將貝雷帽戴在頭上,
和你巨大的雞巴上的避孕套。

423
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:43,000
僅此而已。

424
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:52,200
叛變的愛爾蘭屄請求
允許不前往開羅,
先生。

425
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:06,160
音樂:祝福他們所有人
作者:喬治·福姆比

426
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:33,799
嘿,小夥子們,誰
點了咖啡

427
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,600
這裡的霜淇淋蛋筒呢？

428
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:42,879
那麼什麼是白色引擎蓋
那麼,代表女士們嗎？

429
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,440
你是女童子軍嗎？

430
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:47,360
讓我看看。

431
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,800
哦,哦！不應該那樣做。

432
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:54,359
你覺得怎麼樣？

433
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:57,880
你們可愛的女士們想要哪一個
帶我去阿斯科特,過女士節？

434
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:03,360
什麼？記住,大衛男孩...

435
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:06,759
..即使我們無法理解

436
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:11,600
一個他媽的詞這些蘇格蘭浪蕩子
說。。。

437
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:19,480
..他們是英國人,而我們不是
允許殺死他們。

438
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,120
浪漫的音樂播放

439
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:52,280
鳥鳴

440
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,840
看在你媽的份上。

441
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:16,560
我受不了了
東西。。。抱怨。

442
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:27,439
滾開！

443
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,760
耶穌。

444
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:34,920
對不起。

445
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:39,720
你在開玩笑。

446
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:15,120
這他媽是怎麼回事,雷格？
..在我們的貝雷帽的顏色上！

447
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:23,159
其他人對我們有意見
他媽的頭飾？！

448
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:24,919
請向前走。

449
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:26,720
議員們來了！

450
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:33,439
雖然,我不得不說,關於
新貝雷帽的顏色,

451
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:35,480
他們確實有道理。

452
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:47,519
我聽說你的新支隊在做什麼
很好。

453
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,319
這不是我的超脫。

454
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:50,840
這是喬克的超脫。

455
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:59,680
我想現在是
我的,屬於我和那個瘋子。

456
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,160
這裡。謝謝。

457
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:06,720
如果你不喜歡金絲雀
在籠子里,你為什麼會得到一個？

458
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:11,119
的。。。所以我可以釋放它。

459
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:13,639
你可能認為我很富有同情心。

460
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:15,639
你沒有同情心嗎？

461
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:18,200
不,我不認為我是。

462
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:23,480
為了你的勝利。啊。。。

463
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:36,879
雖然你看起來像一個
失去。

464
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:41,880
是的,我是一個玩遊戲的男孩
而我父親看著...

465
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,480
..像往常一樣。

466
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:48,519
如果我沒有獲得最多的嘗試,
或跑得最多,

467
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:51,199
他不會和我說話
回家的路。

468
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:53,799
這是汽車的聲音
發動機、擋風玻璃雨刷器

469
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:56,560
和雷鳴般的咆哮
他的沉默。

470
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,520
我們出去喝一杯吧。

471
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:09,919
急什麼？

472
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:11,159
不著急。

473
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:13,680
只想看日落
從帝國俱樂部的陽臺上。

474
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:19,840
我寧願留在這裡。

475
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:23,479
還行。

476
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:25,199
真相。

477
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:29,880
有我要你去的人
遇。。。今晚。

478
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:34,760
絕密。

479
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:38,359
有我在想
你和我在一起

480
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:39,640
因為你喜歡我。

481
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:51,440
我非常努力地只喜歡
你。

482
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:01,560
什麼。

483
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:33,080
歐文！

484
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:41,840
歐文？！

485
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:50,999
你的身體

486
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,360
我想,在這裡遇見你的靈魂。

487
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:17,720
我要讀你,
荷馬或濟慈...

488
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:22,199
..但後來我想,去他媽的。

489
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:23,559
我想我曾經讓你厭煩過。

490
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:25,800
而你只是在禮貌。

491
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:33,840
你還記得那個愚蠢的珀西
我們以前唱的法語歌？

492
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:39,320
我會給你唱珀西法國的東西
我們會笑一笑。

493
00:46:56,160 --> 00:47:01,119
# 我們會越過溝渠,我們的領導者
說著就把敵人從側翼拿下

494
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:05,119
# 但當時驚愕地大喊大叫
從各個等級中產生

495
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:08,239
# 用於張貼在高高的樹上

496
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:10,599
# 我們非常清楚地看到

497
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:14,680
# 非法侵入者被起訴
依法

498
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:20,159
# 我們被挫敗了,大膽地驚呼
斯萊特裡

499
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:23,239
# 我們的盛大活動到此結束

500
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:27,480
# 快樂地拋棄生命
面對那匹母馬和排水

501
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:33,240
# 現在我不像獅子那麼勇敢
但我比母雞勇敢

502
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:39,600
# 而打架逃跑的人
將活著再次戰鬥...#

503
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,080
哦,逃跑,嗯,歐文？

504
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:55,840
哦,多麼偉大的生活
那將是一個懦夫。

505
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:01,240
如此熱愛生活。

506
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:14,240
我想,我們今晚就睡在這裡。

507
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:35,479
親愛的上帝,我希望這不是
你的小驚喜。

508
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:37,159
看。。。

509
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:38,480
不,不是。

510
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:41,640
他見過我們。他喝醉了。

511
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:46,759
斯特林。斯特林少校,現在,我
聽見。

512
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:50,399
雖然我相信你個人
一無所獲。

513
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:52,959
我有東西給你。

514
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:56,159
看來我的幻影團
有了新的精神。

515
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:57,720
誰敢贏？

516
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:02,039
你他媽的從哪裡弄來的？

517
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:05,480
有人從酒吧里撿到的
鬥毆后的地板？

518
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:10,439
我的好朋友,人民委員部
開羅員警,告訴我

519
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:14,599
結果有七場戰鬥
受傷過紅燈

520
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:19,039
開羅區自10:00起
今天上午,其中六次涉及

521
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:21,359
戴著SAS貝雷帽的男人。

522
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:25,440
是的,他們是不會退縮的男人
如果他們受到侮辱,就下來。

523
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:29,359
哦,我明白。

524
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:31,599
以及顏色的選擇
是故意的。

525
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:34,559
克拉克先生,夏娃和我正在計劃
吃晚飯。

526
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:37,079
你選擇白色來挑釁
對質。

527
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:40,159
你看,親愛的,有
沒有什麼比酒吧鬥毆更像了

528
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:42,199
將男人聚集在一起。

529
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:44,359
有利於公司士氣。

530
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:47,040
克拉克先生,我在問
你禮貌地。

531
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:49,440
別管我們。

532
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:53,559
你是一個標本。

533
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:55,279
你一事無成。

534
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:58,480
然而你有膽量
重新設計我團的跳躍翅膀。

535
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:03,920
感謝您帶來SAS
成存在。

536
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:08,439
感謝您歸還貝雷帽。

537
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:10,000
現在,滾蛋。

538
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:19,599
你最好讓她教你
一些法國人,老男孩。

539
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:24,520
法國人正在向你走來,
他們是真正的交易。

540
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:42,199
他是什麼意思 - 法語
來找我？

541
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:43,959
讓我們跳舞吧。

542
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:45,840
好吧。

543
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:14,800
這他媽的到底是怎麼回事？

544
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:20,839
奧金萊克...

545
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:22,000
..他剛到。

546
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:29,839
常規。曼蘇爾小姐。

547
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:31,800
你好？斯特林。

548
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:48,159
一點兒。井
對於商業,

549
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:52,080
我更喜歡用英語。常規
奧金萊克,你怎麼來了？

550
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:57,559
好吧,您的成功給我們帶來了
在這裡,還有伯格船長的

551
00:51:57,560 --> 00:51:59,199
請求説明。

552
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:01,039
請允許我。

553
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:03,159
我不要任何人
強加給我,

554
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:05,839
因此,我不要
強加給你。

555
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:07,079
強加什麼？

556
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:08,599
我有20個

557
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:11,519
最堅韌,最優秀的傘兵
在法國軍隊中,

558
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:13,199
在我的指揮下。

559
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:17,439
他們就像拴著皮帶的野狗,
想殺死德國人。

560
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:20,479
好吧,我們要部署
他們在沙漠中,

561
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:23,039
但他們必須接受培訓。

562
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:26,040
我們的首席培訓官
在行動中陣亡。

563
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:28,920
我們會找別人的。

564
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:32,239
一切都安排好了。

565
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:35,760
我們正在派遣法國傘兵
加入你。

566
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:38,440
由誰決定？

567
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:43,039
這是我的想法。

568
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:46,479
在那之前的一切
一直是該戰略的一部分。

569
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:49,599
我的首要任務是執行
的戰爭。

570
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:51,080
你的也是。

571
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:57,039
首先,你只會
必須饒恕一個人。有人

572
00:52:57,040 --> 00:53:01,559
留下來訓練自由人
沙漠戰爭中的法國人。

573
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:04,559
但為了對付我的野性
狗,他必須是

574
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:06,600
一個非常堅強的人。

575
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:13,119
此部署何時開始？

576
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:15,039
好人。

577
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:17,319
來吧,喝一杯。
我們可以買幾把椅子嗎？

578
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:23,400
曼蘇爾小姐,你一定要告訴我
關於你最後幾天的一切...

579
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:07,840
鋼琴演奏

580
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:28,920
你找到他了嗎？

581
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:34,360
是的。

582
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:37,560
水稻。。。

583
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:48,960
..GHQ正在向我們派遣一支支隊
法國傘兵。

584
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:52,200
我們不需要更多的男人。

585
00:54:55,960 --> 00:55:00,039
嗯,這是直接訂單
來自奧金萊克本人,一個恩惠

586
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:02,720
給戴高樂,承諾
由溫斯頓邱吉爾。

587
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:09,079
但我們需要有人
來訓練他們。

588
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:10,559
有經驗的人。

589
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:12,719
有人建立訓練營。

590
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:15,839
訓練他們在這個烤箱裡戰鬥
由沙子製成,你看。

591
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:17,440
誰？

592
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:20,840
井。。。

593
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:25,479
..隨著喬克的消失...

594
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:28,920
..沒有其他人經驗豐富
足夠或足夠堅韌。

595
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:34,120
我決定必須是你。

596
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:44,560
所以我留在賈洛,而你繼續
外出執行任務？

597
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:52,679
是的,當然,我們會
繼續我們的活動。

598
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:55,000
所以失敗者找到了獲勝的方法。

599
00:55:56,680 --> 00:56:02,279
你知道,我的老爸,愛爾蘭人
從雙方,從雙方刺傷

600
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:05,159
像你這樣的男人。

601
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:06,519
蘭丹寧紳士。

602
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:08,159
帕迪,沒有其他人了。

603
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:10,519
他對我說生活
作為一個普通人,

604
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:11,720
他說。。。

605
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:18,239
你配不上我父親的
智慧。

606
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:20,399
右。好吧,聽著,帕迪。

607
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:24,039
哦 - 有時
當你在指揮時,

608
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:27,119
你需要製造困難
決定。

609
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:30,280
不彈他媽的鋼琴就走
在沙漠中觀光。

610
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:50,160
槍聲

611
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:11,440
我們完蛋了。

612
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,999
I'm not asking for anything
other than permission.

613
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,279
And 60 men. Men I will choose
according to my own criteria.

614
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:09,760
If you decide to join them, I will
join the SAS too.

615
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:13,159
Dearest Mirren, you know I love you.

616
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:14,879
I know I could make you so happy.

617
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,440
If you go out in this,
it will be suicide.

618
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,920
Who? McGonigal, sir.

619
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:28,159
What is it about Stirling
that you dislike so much?

620
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,359
I invented the SAS.

621
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:33,839
He had no right to destroy
it on its first mission.

622
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,479
We have a second chance.

623
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:38,319
Let's see what the stars
have in store for us.

624
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,639
GUNS COCK

625
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,200
MACHINE GUN FIRE

626
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,879
That's Paddy Mayne...

627
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,439
And here am I in the dark
and silent...

628
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,439
It's not a competition, sir.

629
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,759
Of course it is.

630
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:55,880
Oh, I see.
Let the games begin.

631
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:21,040
MUSIC: The Game
by Motorhead

632
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,840
LAUGHS WILDLY

633
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,480
Come on, catch him.

634
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,320
How do you like these?

635
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,200
Where the hell did you learn
to drive like that, Paddy Mayne?

636
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:37,559
Now, we will break off into four
units as before.

637
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,679
I'm guessing it's the same teams
as the last time we attacked

638
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:44,479
these same airstrips, just to keep
the scoring system fair?

639
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,879
Nope.

640
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,439
Different teams, same team leaders.

641
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,279
Because this whole exercise,
the whole North Africa campaign

642
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,599
is about my team versus your team,
Paddy.

643
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,359
Aye.
Just as long as that is clear.

644
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,199
Gentlemen, this is a theatre
of war, not a playground.

645
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,559
And this time it will be different,
because now the Germans

646
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,999
are expecting us.

647
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,439
Every airstrip will be on high
alert.

648
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,920
Even more fun, Jock.

649
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:11,919
So now perhaps double points

650
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,200
for each plane destroyed?

651
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,599
Lewes, you will take Almonds
and Riley to Nofilia airstrip.

652
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,079
Fraser... I want no
part in this idiotic game.

653
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,839
..you will go with Lewes,
but take four men and break

654
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,999
off at the airstrip to attack
the airfield to the west.

655
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,599
And Paddy, just as the last time,

656
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:35,040
you will take Tamet and I will take
Sirte.

657
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,799
Round two then, sir.

658
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,799
Oh, yes, round two.

659
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,319
Can I come on your team, then, sir?

660
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,839
Of course you can, sweetheart,
you stick with Uncle Paddy.

661
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,079
Oh, she's a keen kitten.
She is.

662
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:51,479
And whoever destroys the most
aeroplanes tonight will win a bottle

663
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:56,959
of 20-year-old single malt
Scotch whisky!

664
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,840
CHEERING

665
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,560
Oh, my father's favourite.

666
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:07,639
Now, I carry it with me in case
I'm fatally wounded.

667
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:11,800
Now, I'm offering it as a prize
in our game.

668
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,759
Paddy, you've had a lot
of whisky in your time.

669
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,439
Nothing as good as this,

670
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,239
considering your humble background.

671
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,199
Shall I stand between you two
fucking

672
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,840
idiots like a headmaster?

673
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,800
Myself, I prefer potcheen, distilled
in bathtubs.

674
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,680
But I will gladly take this
pish off your hands when I win, sir.

675
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,720
OK, men, check your weapons.

676
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,320
GUNS COCKING

677
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,079
David.

678
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,960
What's this idiotic nonsense
about a game?

679
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:57,639
No commanding officer has ever
been able to control Paddy Mayne

680
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,319
because none of them understood him.
He will fight against me

681
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,119
come what may.

682
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:05,759
But now, he will try to retain
dominance by destroying enemy

683
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:10,319
aircraft, which is essential
if we don't want Tobruk to fall.

684
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,599
Yes, but is it really clever
strategy, David, or do

685
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,240
you just want to win the game?

686
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,439
What time is it? Ten minutes to
midnight.

687
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,360
We need to wait for the moon to set.

688
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,519
Let's wait here for the moon to set.

689
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,839
Four miles to the airstrip. The
coast road is

690
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,639
just over that ridge.

691
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:10,679
We can't risk the vehicles
any further.

692
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,160
Fuck the moon.

693
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,960
There you are, sir.
Let's go.

694
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,440
VOICES IN DISTANCE

695
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,279
The cheeky bastards have put up
fences.

696
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,679
Aye, cheeky fox.

697
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,359
But it'll make it more fun
this time.

698
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:59,159
I think we should wait for the moon
to settle - they'll see us.

699
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,999
No, the moon is our friend.

700
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,640
Patience is our enemy.

701
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,280
And besides,
those that see us will soon be dead.

702
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,720
Listen...

703
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,440
DEEP RUMBLING

704
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,480
Just as I thought, fences
and searchlights this time.

705
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,079
All righty.

706
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,880
I want you to read this.

707
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,840
Um...

708
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,759
..I'm not religious, sir.

709
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,439
If you're unable to read the print,

710
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:15,319
the light will be sufficiently
bad for us to move.

711
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,480
Pass it me, it's my favourite.

712
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,519
And, er, what are you doing, sir?

713
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,439
We have at least 15 more minutes.

714
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,440
So you read your Bible.

715
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,680
I'm going to pray in my own way.

716
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,040
LOW CHUCKLE

717
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,919
My dearest Mirren,

718
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:03,319
it has been two weeks since I sent
you my letter of marriage proposal.

719
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,639
I'm imagining that I haven't
received a response

720
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,719
because of faults in the mail
service.

721
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,639
We are now based on the planet Mars.

722
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,240
And mail comes once every blue moon.

723
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:19,199
And speaking of the moon, every time
I look at it, I think of you.

724
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,800
So damn corny, isn't it? Like one
of those awful Hollywood films.

725
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:27,040
SHE LAUGHS

726
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:35,399
But the moon gives me hope
that something so cold and remote

727
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,280
can appear beautiful.

728
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:46,599
I believe I too am considered cold
and remote by some, and I am hoping

729
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,719
that you might also consider
me, if not beautiful,

730
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,680
then at least dependable.

731
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,000
And I hope that your answer
to my proposal will be yes.

732
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:07,640
The light died just after
"Thou shalt not kill", sir.

733
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:16,559
Well, I can tell you the full
commandment - Thou shalt not kill,

734
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,159
except in a very good cause.

735
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:22,159
Every day, Hitler sends innocents
to their deaths.

736
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,240
So we have a very good cause.

737
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,399
Fraser.

738
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,919
Take your men west.

739
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,159
We go east.

740
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,320
Go well, sir.

741
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,959
Best of luck, boys.

German reinforcements heading
to join Rommel.

745
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:05,840
We can't reach Sirte airstrip
without crossing that road.

746
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,800

Five is five.

Five Messerschmitts taken out of

They don't care about the scores on

no break for three
hours. There will be a break.

764
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:46,519
German troops stay tight to
prevent... There will be a bloody
break, Sadler!

765
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,959
I will get a break.

Now, then. what the fuck has he
blown up?

00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:04,999
Whatever it is, I imagine there's
little doubt about the destination

785
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:23,360

00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,479
Of course.
Of course.

792
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,599
The road became clear
when it was already too late.

793
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,679
Or imagine a more amusing
possibility.

794
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:53,599
The road became clear
BECAUSE it was too late.

795
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,160
Therein lies a crucial philosophical
distinction.

796
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:07,999
In The Iliad, Homer wrote,
Fate is born with us.

797
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,920
No man escapes it, neither
brave man nor coward.

798
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,720
What do you say, Sadler?

799
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,640
I say no when he's talking
of bravery or cowardice.

00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,560
Indeed.

801
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,440
No-one is talking at all.

802
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,799
HE FARTS

803
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,960
If you see a brown stone, Rog,
stay away from it.

804
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,120
Stirling!

805
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,440
We done it.

806
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,840
I want to write down the scores.

807
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,320
Why don't you leave it alone, Paddy?

808
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,840
Rog, 24 plus 27...

809
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,400
50...

810
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,359
..1.

811
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,480
Scare the Jerries off, that.

812
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:35,559
Even though they took extra
precautions, I think

813
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,839
we did rather well.

814
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:42,719
Wires, dogs, wide-eyed,
boys notwithstanding.

815
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,359
What caused all the fireworks?

816
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,559
5,000 gallons of aviation fuel.

817
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,519
Ah.

818
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,719
I'm not counting that in my tally.

819
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,919
What about you?

820
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,960
Who's getting the whisky?

821
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,600
The prize has gone, Paddy.

822
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:07,040
Some of it I drank, the rest
shot to pieces.

823
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,080
Decided it was a worthless gesture.

824
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:17,279
My strategy was ugly and vain,
and a bottle of whisky is not

825
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,399
a fitting reward
for the resourcefulness and courage

826
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,239
you have shown over two
very dangerous assignments.

827
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,680
So...

828
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:31,319
..I'm going to recommend to GHQ
that you be awarded

829
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:36,679
the Distinguished Service Order
Medal and that you be promoted

830
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,680
to the rank of captain.

831
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,199
Congratulations, Captain Mayne.

832
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:52,639
The Special Air Services first
combat medal and first promotion.

833
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:57,280
Three cheers for Captain Paddy
Mayne, the mad bastard of Tamet
strip!

834
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,879
Hip-hip...
Hooray!

835
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,479
Hip-hip... Hooray!

836
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,839
Now you can try wearing the mantle
of power yourself,

837
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,560
you mutinous Irish cunt.

838
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,240
You see you...

839
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:16,880
You are the first commanding officer
that I've ever actually liked.

840
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,400
Huh.

841
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,440
Where in the hell is Lewes?

842
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,960
Mirren?

843
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,000
Mirren?

845
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,079
What are you doing?

846
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,479
I was asking my dear-departed
grandmother a question.

847
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,160
What question?

848
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,919
You're being very mysterious.

849
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,679
Where are we going?

850
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,400
My grandmother said yes.

851
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,799
So let's do it.

852
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,640
In the back of the car!

853
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,960
It's what all the young people
in America do, apparently.

854
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,879
Erm...

00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,559
Remember, you have to pull out.

857
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,959
I will, my love.

858
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,520
I will.

859

860
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,720

Oh, oh, Lord!

864
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,159
What?

865
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:16,239
Quickly, for God's sake.
What do we do?

866
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,399
Like this? Yes, quicker.

867
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,319
Oh!

868
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,400
Oh! Goodness.

00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,999

Oh!

872
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:41,359
What? Now you are ruined?

873
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,040
My dress is ruined.

874
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,360
Well, Mirren...

875
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,719
When we're married, there
will be no need

876
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,600
for strategic withdrawals.

877
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,600
You always resort to military terms
when you're embarrassed.

878
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,760
Did you hear me?

879
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,080
I said, when we're married.

880
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,960

Get the Bren gun.

Scatter!

Everybody scatter!

Get down, sir, there's another

something of a priority, how
flattering.

00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:14,559
Dear Jock, I received your letter
this morning, and I danced.

970
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:17,519
I actually danced with the letter
in my hand as if it was

971
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,480
you I was dancing with.

972
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,079
Of course I will marry you, Jock.

973
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,760
Of course I will.

974
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:53,960
Parade.

975
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,879
Parade.

976
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,200
Attention.

977
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,359
Morning, gentlemen.

978
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,879
ALL: Morning, sir.

979
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,679
He said, "Good morning, gentlemen."

980
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:06,159
GOOD MORNING, SIR!

981
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,959
Like fucking primary school.

982
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,440
Relax.

983
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:14,279
Well, if this is primary school,

984
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:17,599
I've had a message
from the headmaster,

985
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,479
General Auchinleck himself.

986
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:23,520
But before I tell
you what he has to say...

987
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:28,760
..the period of mourning
for Lieutenant Jock Lewes is over.

988
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,479
Cooper,

989
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,840
hoist the flag. Sir!

990
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:41,999
Auchinleck expresses his
astonishment at the success

991
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,759
that we have achieved in such
a short space of time.

992
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:47,679
Having destroyed 90 enemy aircraft
in three weeks,

993
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:50,679
we have exceeded the number
destroyed by the RAF

994
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:53,359
by a factor of three. Fuck!

995
00:35:53,360 --> 00:36:00,559
Paddy Mayne's DSO has been
confirmed and he has been promoted

996
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,920
to the rank of captain. Sir?

997
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,639
It's not working.

998
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,639
Right, Seekings,

999
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,719
help that poor boy now.

1000
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,200
Fucking gladly, sir.

1001
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:16,519
Fraser has been awarded
the Military Cross.

1002
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:18,959
Rope snagged, is it?
Yeah.

1003
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,639
And I have been promoted to the rank
of major.

1004
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:25,639
We have made... I think
it's the wheel. It's the fucking
rope, you oaf.

1005
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:27,439
Hey, talk to me like that,

1006
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:30,800
I'll knock your bleeding block off!
Go on, then! Fuck sake!

1007
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:44,599
In the bigger picture,

1008
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:49,559
against the odds, we now
have the initiative.

1009
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:54,319
This success is in thanks in no
small part to the work that you,

1010
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:58,199
the men of the SAS have carried out.

1011
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:04,159
We achieve our success because we do
things differently.

1012
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:08,079
We achieve our goals in our own way.

1013
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:10,679
Fuck wheels.
Fuck ropes.

1014
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:12,640
Just tie the fucking thing.

1015
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:21,999
In recognition of your startling
successes, GHQ

1016
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,479
have awarded you all five days
leave.

1017
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:28,919
We may not be an official regiment,
but when you make your way

1018
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:34,559
to your bars and brothels in Cairo,
you will all be wearing one

1019
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:39,799
of these - cap badges by Bob Tait.

1020
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:44,119
The flaming sword is the legendary
sword Excalibur.

1021
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,560
New jump wings.

1022
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,080
They were designed by Jock.

1023
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,839
Those of you that can read,
will have read the motto

1024
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,359
on our badge.

1025
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:57,839
Now, Paddy, since you have embodied
the words best, I will leave

1026
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:00,519
it to you to say them.

1027
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:04,079
The new motto
of the Special Air Service is -

1028
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:09,040
drink rum, fight dirty, fuck the
rules.

1029
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:19,120
The new motto is Who Dares Wins.

1030
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:24,200
Who dares...wins.

1031
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:28,240
And we will continue to dare.

1032
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:36,319
There are trucks
on the way to take you all to Cairo.

1033
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:41,239
Wear the beret on your head,
and a condom on your massive cocks.

1034
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:43,000
That'll be all.

1035
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:52,200
Mutinous Irish cunt requesting
permission not to travel to Cairo,
sir.

MUSIC: Bless 'Em All
by George Formby

1037
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:33,799
Hey, lads, who
ordered the coffee

1038
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,600
and the ice cream cones here?

1039
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:42,879
So what's the white bonnet
represent, then, ladies?

1040
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,440
Are you Girl Scouts?

1041
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:47,360
Let me see that.

1042
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,800
Oh, oh! Shouldn't have done that.

1043
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:54,359
What do you think?

1044
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:57,880
Which one of you lovely ladies wants
to take me to Ascot, for Ladies Day?

1045
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:03,360
What? Remember, Davey boy...

1046
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:06,759
..even though we can't understand

1047
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:11,600
a fucking word these Scotch wankers
say...

1048
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:19,480
..they are British and we're not
allowed to kill them.

For fuck's sake.

1052
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:16,560
I can't bear this
thing...complaining.

1053
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:27,439
Fuck off!

1054
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,760
Jesus.

1055
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:34,920
I'm sorry.

1056
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:39,720
You're joking.

1057
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:15,120
What the fuck's going on, Reg?
..Over the colour of our berets!

1058
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:23,159
Anybody else have an opinion on our
fucking headgear?!

1059
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:24,919
Please step forward.

1060
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:26,720
MPs are coming!

1061
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:33,439
Although, I have to say, regarding
the colour of the new beret,

1062
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:35,480
they do have a point.

1063
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:47,519
I hear your new detachment's doing
very well.

1064
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,319
This isn't really my detachment.

1065
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:50,840
It's Jock's detachment.

1066
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:59,680
I suppose now it is
mine, belongs to me and that madman.

1067
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,160
Here. Thank you.

1068
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:06,720
If you don't like canaries
in cages, why did you get one?

1069
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:11,119
Er...so I can set it free.

1070
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:13,639
You might think I'm compassionate.

1071
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:15,639
Are you not compassionate?

1072
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:18,200
No, I don't think I am.

1073
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:23,480
To your victories. Ah...

1074
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:36,879
Though you look like someone who is
losing.

1075
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:41,880
Yes, I am a boy playing a game
while my father watches...

1076
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,480
..as he always did.

1077
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:48,519
If I don't score the most tries,
or make the most runs,

1078
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:51,199
he won't speak to me all
the way home.

1079
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:53,799
It's the sound of the car
engine, the windscreen wipers

1080
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:56,560
and the thunderous roar
of his silence.

1081
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,520
Let's go out for a drink.

1082
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:09,919
What's the rush?

1083
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:11,159
No rush.

1084
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:13,680
Just want to see the sunset
from the balcony of the Empire Club.

1085
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:19,840
I would, er, rather stay here.

1086
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:23,479
OK.

1087
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:25,199
The truth.

1088
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:29,880
There's someone I want you to
meet...tonight.

1089
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:34,760
Top secret.

1090
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:38,359
And there was me thinking
that you were with me

1091
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:39,640
because you liked me.

1092
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:51,440
I'm trying very hard to only like
you.

1093
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:01,560
Come.

1094
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:33,080
Owen!

1095
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:41,840
Owen?!

1096
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:50,999
Your bodies

1097
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,360
meet your spirits here, I think.

1098
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:17,720
I was going to read you,
Homer or Keats...

1099
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:22,199
..but then I thought, fuck that.

1100
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:23,559
I think I used to bore you with it.

1101
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:25,800
And you were just being polite.

1102
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:33,840
You remember that idiotic Percy
French song we used to sing?

1103
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:39,320
I'll sing you the Percy French thing
and we'll have a laugh.

1104
00:46:56,160 --> 00:47:01,119
# We'll cross the ditch, our leader
said and take the foe in flank

1105
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:05,119
# But yells of consternation then
arose from every rank

1106
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:08,239
# For posted high upon a tree

1107
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:10,599
# We very plainly saw

1108
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:14,680
# Trespassers prosecuted in
accordance with the law

1109
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:20,159
# We're foiled, exclaimed bold
Slattery

1110
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:23,239
# Here ends our grand campaign

1111
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:27,480
# Tis merrily throwing life away
to face that mare and drain

1112
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:33,240
# Now I'm not as brave as lions
but I'm braver than the hen

1113
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:39,600
# And he who fights and runs away
will live to fight again... #

1114
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,080
Oh, to run away, eh, Owen?

1115
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:55,840
Oh, how grand a life
it would be to be a coward.

1116
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:01,240
To love life that much.

1117
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:14,240
We'll sleep here tonight, I think.

1118
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:35,479
Dear God, I do hope this isn't
your little surprise.

1119
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:37,159
Look...

1120
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:38,480
No, it isn't.

1121
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:41,640
He's seen us. And he's drunk.

1122
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:46,759
Stirling. Major Stirling, now, I
hear.

1123
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:50,399
Although I believe you personally
have achieved nothing.

1124
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:52,959
I have something for you.

1125
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:56,159
It seems my phantom regiment
has a new ethos.

1126
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:57,720
Who Dares Wins?

1127
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:02,039
Where the fuck did you get that?

1128
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:05,480
Someone picked it off a barroom
floor after a brawl?

1129
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:10,439
My great friend, the Commissariat
of Cairo Police, tells me

1130
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:14,599
there were seven fights resulting
in injury across the red light

1131
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:19,039
district of Cairo since 10:00
this morning, six of them involving

1132
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:21,359
men wearing the SAS beret.

1133
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:25,440
Yes, they are men who will not back
down if they are insulted.

1134
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:29,359
Oh, I see.

1135
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:31,599
And the choice of colour
was deliberate.

1136
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:34,559
Mr Clarke, Eve and I are planning
to have dinner.

1137
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:37,079
You chose white to provoke
confrontation.

1138
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:40,159
You see, my dear, there's
nothing like a barroom brawl

1139
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:42,199
to bring men together.

1140
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:44,359
Good for company morale.

1141
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:47,040
Mr Clarke, I am asking
you politely.

1142
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:49,440
Leave us alone.

1143
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:53,559
You are a specimen.

1144
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:55,279
You've achieved nothing.

1145
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:58,480
Yet you have the audacity to
redesign my regiment's jump wings.

1146
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:03,920
Thank you for bringing the SAS
into being.

1147
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:08,439
Thank you for returning the beret.

1148
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:10,000
Now, fuck off.

1149
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:19,599
You'd better get her to teach you
some French, old boy.

1150
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:24,520
The French are coming your way,
and they are the real deal.

1151
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:42,199
What did he mean - French
coming my way?

1152
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:43,959
Let's dance.

1153
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:45,840
All right.

1154
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:14,800
What the fuck is this all about?

1155
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:20,839
Auchinleck...

1156
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:22,000
..he just arrived.

1157
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:29,839
General. Miss Mansour.

1158
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:31,800
How do you do? Stirling.

1159
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:48,159
A little. Well,
for business,

1160
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:52,080
I prefer to use English. General
Auchinleck, what brings you here?

1161
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:57,559
Well, your success brings us
here, and Captain Berge's

1162
00:51:57,560 --> 00:51:59,199
request for help.

1163
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:01,039
Please, allow me.

1164
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:03,159
I would not want anyone
to impose upon me,

1165
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:05,839
therefore, I don't want
to impose on you.

1166
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:07,079
Impose what?

1167
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:08,599
I have 20 of

1168
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:11,519
the toughest, finest paratroopers
in the French Army,

1169
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:13,199
under my command.

1170
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:17,439
They're like wild dogs on leashes,
wanting to kill Germans.

1171
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:20,479
Well, we want to deploy
them in the desert,

1172
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:23,039
but they have to be trained.

1173
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:26,040
Our chief training officer
was killed in action.

1174
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:28,920
We'll find somebody else.

1175
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:32,239
It's all been arranged.

1176
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:35,760
We're sending French paratroopers
to join you.

1177
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:38,440
Decided by who?

1178
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:43,039
This was my idea.

1179
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:46,479
And everything up until then
has been part of the strategy.

1180
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:49,599
My first priority is the execution
of the war.

1181
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:51,080
So is yours.

1182
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:57,039
To begin with, you'd only
have to spare one man. Somebody

1183
00:52:57,040 --> 00:53:01,559
left behind to train the Free
French in desert warfare.

1184
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:04,559
But in order to deal with my wild
dogs, he would have to be

1185
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:06,600
a very strong man.

1186
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:13,119
When would this deployment begin?

1187
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:15,039
Good man.

1188
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:17,319
Come on, have a drink.
Can we get some chairs?

1189
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:23,400
Miss Mansour, you must tell me
all about your last few days...

1190
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:07,840
PIANO PLAYS

1191
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:28,920
Did you find him?

1192
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:34,360
Yep.

1193
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:37,560
Paddy...

1194
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:48,960
..GHQ are sending us a detachment
of French paratroopers.

1195
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:52,200
We don't need many more men.

1196
00:54:55,960 --> 00:55:00,039
Well, it's a direct order
from Auchinleck himself, a favour

1197
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:02,720
to Charles de Gaulle, promised
by Winston Churchill.

1198
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:09,079
But we would need someone
to train them.

1199
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:10,559
Someone with experience.

1200
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:12,719
Someone to set up a training camp.

1201
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:15,839
Train them to fight in this oven
made of sand, you see.

1202
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:17,440
Who?

1203
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:20,840
Well...

1204
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:25,479
..with Jock gone...

1205
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:28,920
..there is no-one else experienced
enough or tough enough.

1206
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:34,120
I've decided it has to be you.

1207
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:44,560
So I stay in Jalo while you continue
to go out on missions?

1208
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:52,679
Yes, of course, we will
continue our campaign.

1209
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:55,000
So the loser finds a way to win.

1210
00:55:56,680 --> 00:56:02,279
You know, my old dad, Irish
from both sides, stabbed from both

1211
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:05,159
sides by men like you.

1212
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:06,519
Landowning gentry.

1213
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:08,159
Paddy, there is no-one else..

1214
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:10,519
He said to me about life
as a common man,

1215
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:11,720
he said...

1216
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:18,239
You don't deserve my father's
wisdom.

1217
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:20,399
Right. Well, listen, Paddy.

1218
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:24,039
Oh - sometimes
when you are in command,

1219
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:27,119
you need to make difficult
decisions.

1220
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:30,280
Not play the fucking piano and go
sightseeing in the desert.

1221
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:50,160
GUNSHOTS

1222
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:11,440
We're fucked.
