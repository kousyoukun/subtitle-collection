1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,999
I'm not asking for anything
other than permission.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,279
And 60 men. Men I will choose
according to my own criteria.

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:09,760
If you decide to join them, I will
join the SAS too.

4
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:13,159
Dearest Mirren, you know I love you.

5
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:14,879
I know I could make you so happy.

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,440
If you go out in this,
it will be suicide.

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,920
Who? McGonigal, sir.

8
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:28,159
What is it about Stirling
that you dislike so much?

9
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,359
I invented the SAS.

10
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:33,839
He had no right to destroy
it on its first mission.

11
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,479
We have a second chance.

12
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:38,319
Let's see what the stars
have in store for us.

13
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,639
GUNS COCK

14
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,200
MACHINE GUN FIRE

15
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,879
That's Paddy Mayne...

16
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,439
And here am I in the dark
and silent...

17
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,439
It's not a competition, sir.

18
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,759
Of course it is.

19
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:55,880
Oh, I see.
Let the games begin.

20
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:21,040
MUSIC: The Game
by Motorhead

21
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,840
LAUGHS WILDLY

22
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,480
Come on, catch him.

23
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,320
How do you like these?

24
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,200
Where the hell did you learn
to drive like that, Paddy Mayne?

25
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:37,559
Now, we will break off into four
units as before.

26
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,679
I'm guessing it's the same teams
as the last time we attacked

27
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:44,479
these same airstrips, just to keep
the scoring system fair?

28
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,879
Nope.

29
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,439
Different teams, same team leaders.

30
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,279
Because this whole exercise,
the whole North Africa campaign

31
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,599
is about my team versus your team,
Paddy.

32
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,359
Aye.
Just as long as that is clear.

33
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,199
Gentlemen, this is a theatre
of war, not a playground.

34
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,559
And this time it will be different,
because now the Germans

35
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,999
are expecting us.

36
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,439
Every airstrip will be on high
alert.

37
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,920
Even more fun, Jock.

38
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:11,919
So now perhaps double points

39
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,200
for each plane destroyed?

40
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,599
Lewes, you will take Almonds
and Riley to Nofilia airstrip.

41
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,079
Fraser... I want no
part in this idiotic game.

42
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,839
..you will go with Lewes,
but take four men and break

43
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,999
off at the airstrip to attack
the airfield to the west.

44
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,599
And Paddy, just as the last time,

45
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:35,040
you will take Tamet and I will take
Sirte.

46
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,799
Round two then, sir.

47
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,799
Oh, yes, round two.

48
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,319
Can I come on your team, then, sir?

49
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,839
Of course you can, sweetheart,
you stick with Uncle Paddy.

50
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,079
Oh, she's a keen kitten.
She is.

51
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:51,479
And whoever destroys the most
aeroplanes tonight will win a bottle

52
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:56,959
of 20-year-old single malt
Scotch whisky!

53
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,840
CHEERING

54
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,560
Oh, my father's favourite.

55
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:07,639
Now, I carry it with me in case
I'm fatally wounded.

56
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:11,800
Now, I'm offering it as a prize
in our game.

57
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,759
Paddy, you've had a lot
of whisky in your time.

58
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,439
Nothing as good as this,

59
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,239
considering your humble background.

60
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,199
Shall I stand between you two
fucking

61
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,840
idiots like a headmaster?

62
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,800
Myself, I prefer potcheen, distilled
in bathtubs.

63
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,680
But I will gladly take this
pish off your hands when I win, sir.

64
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,720
OK, men, check your weapons.

65
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,320
GUNS COCKING

66
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,079
David.

67
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,960
What's this idiotic nonsense
about a game?

68
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:57,639
No commanding officer has ever
been able to control Paddy Mayne

69
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,319
because none of them understood him.
He will fight against me

70
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,119
come what may.

71
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:05,759
But now, he will try to retain
dominance by destroying enemy

72
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:10,319
aircraft, which is essential
if we don't want Tobruk to fall.

73
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,599
Yes, but is it really clever
strategy, David, or do

74
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,240
you just want to win the game?

75
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,439
What time is it? Ten minutes to
midnight.

76
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,360
We need to wait for the moon to set.

77
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,519
Let's wait here for the moon to set.

78
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,839
Four miles to the airstrip. The
coast road is

79
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,639
just over that ridge.

80
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:10,679
We can't risk the vehicles
any further.

81
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,160
Fuck the moon.

82
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,960
There you are, sir.
Let's go.

83
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,440
VOICES IN DISTANCE

84
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,279
The cheeky bastards have put up
fences.

85
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,679
Aye, cheeky fox.

86
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,359
But it'll make it more fun
this time.

87
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:59,159
I think we should wait for the moon
to settle - they'll see us.

88
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,999
No, the moon is our friend.

89
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,640
Patience is our enemy.

90
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,280
And besides,
those that see us will soon be dead.

91
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,720
Listen...

92
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,440
DEEP RUMBLING

93
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,480
Just as I thought, fences
and searchlights this time.

94
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,079
All righty.

95
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,880
I want you to read this.

96
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,840
Um...

97
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,759
..I'm not religious, sir.

98
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,439
If you're unable to read the print,

99
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:15,319
the light will be sufficiently
bad for us to move.

100
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,480
Pass it me, it's my favourite.

101
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,519
And, er, what are you doing, sir?

102
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,439
We have at least 15 more minutes.

103
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,440
So you read your Bible.

104
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,680
I'm going to pray in my own way.

105
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,040
LOW CHUCKLE

106
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,919
My dearest Mirren,

107
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:03,319
it has been two weeks since I sent
you my letter of marriage proposal.

108
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,639
I'm imagining that I haven't
received a response

109
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,719
because of faults in the mail
service.

110
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,639
We are now based on the planet Mars.

111
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,240
And mail comes once every blue moon.

112
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:19,199
And speaking of the moon, every time
I look at it, I think of you.

113
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,800
So damn corny, isn't it? Like one
of those awful Hollywood films.

114
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:27,040
SHE LAUGHS

115
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:35,399
But the moon gives me hope
that something so cold and remote

116
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,280
can appear beautiful.

117
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:46,599
I believe I too am considered cold
and remote by some, and I am hoping

118
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,719
that you might also consider
me, if not beautiful,

119
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,680
then at least dependable.

120
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,000
And I hope that your answer
to my proposal will be yes.

121
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:07,640
The light died just after
"Thou shalt not kill", sir.

122
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:16,559
Well, I can tell you the full
commandment - Thou shalt not kill,

123
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,159
except in a very good cause.

124
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:22,159
Every day, Hitler sends innocents
to their deaths.

125
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,240
So we have a very good cause.

126
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,399
Fraser.

127
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,919
Take your men west.

128
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,159
We go east.

129
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,320
Go well, sir.

130
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,959
Best of luck, boys.

German reinforcements heading
to join Rommel.

134
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:05,840
We can't reach Sirte airstrip
without crossing that road.

135
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,800

no break for three
hours. There will be a break.

German troops stay tight to
prevent... There will be a bloody
break, Sadler!

154
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,959
I will get a break.

155
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,840

# Baby I'm born to lose... #

163
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,280
DOG BARKS

164
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,320
GUARD SHOUTS

165
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,520
Bad dog.

166
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,560
Looks like Paddy's lit another
bonfire.

167
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,400
Now, then. what the fuck has he
blown up?

168
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:04,999
Whatever it is, I imagine there's
little doubt about the destination

169
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,799
of my father's favourite whisky.

170
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,320
LAUGHTER

171
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,400
My father would be very proud.

172
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,719
That's it, road's clear.
That's the last of them.

173
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,519
What time is it?

174
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:23,360
4:26 sun rises at 4:40. It's another
20-minute march to Sirte airstrip.

175
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,520
SIGHS: It's too late.

176
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,520
DISTANT BOOMING

177
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,079
Looks like Lewes and Fraser
have had some success, too.

178
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,639
Bravo!

179
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,280
Bravo!

180
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,479
Of course.
Of course.

181
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,599
The road became clear
when it was already too late.

182
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,679
Or imagine a more amusing
possibility.

183
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:53,599
The road became clear
BECAUSE it was too late.

184
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,160
Therein lies a crucial philosophical
distinction.

185
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:07,999
In The Iliad, Homer wrote,
Fate is born with us.

186
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,920
No man escapes it, neither
brave man nor coward.

187
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,720
What do you say, Sadler?

188
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,640
I say no when he's talking
of bravery or cowardice.

189
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,560
Indeed.

190
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,440
No-one is talking at all.

191
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,799
HE FARTS

192
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,960
If you see a brown stone, Rog,
stay away from it.

193
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,120
Stirling!

194
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,440
We done it.

195
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,840
I want to write down the scores.

196
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,320
Why don't you leave it alone, Paddy?

197
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,840
Rog, 24 plus 27...

198
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,400
50...

199
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,359
..1.

200
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,480
Scare the Jerries off, that.

201
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:35,559
Even though they took extra
precautions, I think

202
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,839
we did rather well.

203
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:42,719
Wires, dogs, wide-eyed,
boys notwithstanding.

204
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,359
What caused all the fireworks?

205
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,559
5,000 gallons of aviation fuel.

206
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,519
Ah.

207
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,719
I'm not counting that in my tally.

208
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,919
What about you?

209
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,960
Who's getting the whisky?

210
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,600
The prize has gone, Paddy.

211
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:07,040
Some of it I drank, the rest
shot to pieces.

212
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,080
Decided it was a worthless gesture.

213
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:17,279
My strategy was ugly and vain,
and a bottle of whisky is not

214
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,399
a fitting reward
for the resourcefulness and courage

215
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,239
you have shown over two
very dangerous assignments.

216
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,680
So...

217
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:31,319
..I'm going to recommend to GHQ
that you be awarded

218
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:36,679
the Distinguished Service Order
Medal and that you be promoted

219
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,680
to the rank of captain.

220
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,199
Congratulations, Captain Mayne.

221
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:52,639
The Special Air Services first
combat medal and first promotion.

222
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:57,280
Three cheers for Captain Paddy
Mayne, the mad bastard of Tamet
strip!

223
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,879
Hip-hip...
Hooray!

224
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,479
Hip-hip... Hooray!

225
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,839
Now you can try wearing the mantle
of power yourself,

226
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,560
you mutinous Irish cunt.

227
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,240
You see you...

228
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:16,880
You are the first commanding officer
that I've ever actually liked.

229
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,400
Huh.

230
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,440
Where in the hell is Lewes?

231
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,960
Mirren?

232
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,000
Mirren?

233
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,719
SHE CHUCKLES

234
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,079
What are you doing?

235
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,479
I was asking my dear-departed
grandmother a question.

236
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,160
What question?

237
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,919
You're being very mysterious.

238
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,679
Where are we going?

239
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,400
My grandmother said yes.

240
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,799
So let's do it.

241
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,640
In the back of the car!

242
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,960
It's what all the young people
in America do, apparently.

243
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,879
Erm...

244
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,440
SHE GIGGLES

245
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,559
Remember, you have to pull out.

246
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,959
I will, my love.

247
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,520
I will.

248
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,360
BOTH GROAN

249
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,720
I love you, Mirren.

250
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,760

Oh, oh, Lord!

253
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,159
What?

254
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:16,239
Quickly, for God's sake.
What do we do?

255
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,399
Like this? Yes, quicker.

256
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,319
Oh!

257
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,400
Oh! Goodness.

258
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,999
Such a lot!

259
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,760
HE CLEARS THROAT

260
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,040
Oh!

261
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:41,359
What? Now you are ruined?

262
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,040
My dress is ruined.

263
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,360
Well, Mirren...

264
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,719
When we're married, there
will be no need

265
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,600
for strategic withdrawals.

266
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,600
You always resort to military terms
when you're embarrassed.

267
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,760
Did you hear me?

268
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,080
I said, when we're married.

269
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,960
Oh, Jock...

270
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,600

Everyone out. Fan out!

275
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:58,079
Grab your weapons, take cover.
Get the Bren gun.

276
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,279
Scatter!

277
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,880
Everybody scatter!

278
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,919
Get down, sir, there's another
plane! Obviously made ourselves

279
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:09,079
something of a priority, how
flattering.

280
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:11,559
Almonds, take cover. Come on.

281
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,360

In answer to your proposal, my

..I really have to say no.

330
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,840
Jock didn't make it.

331
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,839
What-what do you mean?

332
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,360
What do you mean?

333
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,279
What do you think I mean?

334
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:34,520
No. Where is he?

335
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,719
He's fucking dead.

336
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,200
Hey, hey..

337
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:46,599
Where is he?!

338
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,479
He's where he fell.

339
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,279
You left him?

340
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:52,040
I left him...!

341
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:57,520
That's the fucking protocol!

342
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:01,960
You, on your fucking order.

343
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:07,519
"Do not attempt to retrieve
the bodies of the fallen

344
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:10,680
"as it will impede swift execution
of the given mission", sir.

345
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:27,120
He's a bloody mess, out in the sun.

346
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,799
Which is where we

347
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:33,319
are all going to be, now
that Jerry is onto us.

348
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:35,120
STIRLING GRUNTS

349
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:01,480
I actually didn't believe
John Lewes was human.

350
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:07,400
Sir, put out your cigarette.

351
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:11,520
Sir, put out your cigarette.
Fuck off!

352
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,320
Fuck off!

353
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,960
He died well.

354
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:48,320
Sand, sand, quick.

355
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,720
So...

356
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:24,600
..only the dreamer
and the madman left.

357
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,120
Who the fuck is going to be
the sensible one now?

358
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:14,559
Dear Jock, I received your letter
this morning, and I danced.

359
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:17,519
I actually danced with the letter
in my hand as if it was

360
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,480
you I was dancing with.

361
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,079
Of course I will marry you, Jock.

362
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,760
Of course I will.

363
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:53,960
Parade.

364
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,879
Parade.

365
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,200
Attention.

366
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,359
Morning, gentlemen.

367
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,879
ALL: Morning, sir.

368
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,679
He said, "Good morning, gentlemen."

369
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:06,159
GOOD MORNING, SIR!

370
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,959
Like fucking primary school.

371
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,440
Relax.

372
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:14,279
Well, if this is primary school,

373
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:17,599
I've had a message
from the headmaster,

374
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,479
General Auchinleck himself.

375
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:23,520
But before I tell
you what he has to say...

376
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:28,760
..the period of mourning
for Lieutenant Jock Lewes is over.

377
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,479
Cooper,

378
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,840
hoist the flag. Sir!

379
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:41,999
Auchinleck expresses his
astonishment at the success

380
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,759
that we have achieved in such
a short space of time.

381
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:47,679
Having destroyed 90 enemy aircraft
in three weeks,

382
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:50,679
we have exceeded the number
destroyed by the RAF

383
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:53,359
by a factor of three. Fuck!

384
00:35:53,360 --> 00:36:00,559
Paddy Mayne's DSO has been
confirmed and he has been promoted

385
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,920
to the rank of captain. Sir?

386
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,639
It's not working.

387
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,639
Right, Seekings,

388
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,719
help that poor boy now.

389
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,200
Fucking gladly, sir.

390
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:16,519
Fraser has been awarded
the Military Cross.

391
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:18,959
Rope snagged, is it?
Yeah.

392
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,639
And I have been promoted to the rank
of major.

393
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:25,639
We have made... I think
it's the wheel. It's the fucking
rope, you oaf.

394
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:27,439
Hey, talk to me like that,

395
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:30,800
I'll knock your bleeding block off!
Go on, then! Fuck sake!

396
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:44,599
In the bigger picture,

397
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:49,559
against the odds, we now
have the initiative.

398
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:54,319
This success is in thanks in no
small part to the work that you,

399
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:58,199
the men of the SAS have carried out.

400
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:04,159
We achieve our success because we do
things differently.

401
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:08,079
We achieve our goals in our own way.

402
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:10,679
Fuck wheels.
Fuck ropes.

403
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:12,640
Just tie the fucking thing.

404
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:21,999
In recognition of your startling
successes, GHQ

405
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,479
have awarded you all five days
leave.

406
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:28,919
We may not be an official regiment,
but when you make your way

407
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:34,559
to your bars and brothels in Cairo,
you will all be wearing one

408
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:39,799
of these - cap badges by Bob Tait.

409
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:44,119
The flaming sword is the legendary
sword Excalibur.

410
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,560
New jump wings.

411
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,080
They were designed by Jock.

412
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,839
Those of you that can read,
will have read the motto

413
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,359
on our badge.

414
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:57,839
Now, Paddy, since you have embodied
the words best, I will leave

415
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:00,519
it to you to say them.

416
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:04,079
The new motto
of the Special Air Service is -

417
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:09,040
drink rum, fight dirty, fuck the
rules.

418
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:19,120
The new motto is Who Dares Wins.

419
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:24,200
Who dares...wins.

420
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:28,240
And we will continue to dare.

421
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:36,319
There are trucks
on the way to take you all to Cairo.

422
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:41,239
Wear the beret on your head,
and a condom on your massive cocks.

423
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:43,000
That'll be all.

424
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:52,200
Mutinous Irish cunt requesting
permission not to travel to Cairo,
sir.

425
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:06,160
MUSIC: Bless 'Em All
by George Formby

426
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:33,799
Hey, lads, who
ordered the coffee

427
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,600
and the ice cream cones here?

428
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:42,879
So what's the white bonnet
represent, then, ladies?

429
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,440
Are you Girl Scouts?

430
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:47,360
Let me see that.

431
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,800
Oh, oh! Shouldn't have done that.

432
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:54,359
What do you think?

433
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:57,880
Which one of you lovely ladies wants
to take me to Ascot, for Ladies Day?

434
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:03,360
What? Remember, Davey boy...

435
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:06,759
..even though we can't understand

436
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:11,600
a fucking word these Scotch wankers
say...

437
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:19,480
..they are British and we're not
allowed to kill them.

438

ROMANTIC MUSIC PLAYS

439
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:52,280
BIRD CHIRPS

440
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,840
For fuck's sake.

441
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:16,560
I can't bear this
thing...complaining.

442
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:27,439
Fuck off!

443
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,760
Jesus.

444
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:34,920
I'm sorry.

445
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:39,720
You're joking.

446
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:15,120
What the fuck's going on, Reg?
..Over the colour of our berets!

447
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:23,159
Anybody else have an opinion on our
fucking headgear?!

448
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:24,919
Please step forward.

449
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:26,720
MPs are coming!

450
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:33,439
Although, I have to say, regarding
the colour of the new beret,

451
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:35,480
they do have a point.

452
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:47,519
I hear your new detachment's doing
very well.

453
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,319
This isn't really my detachment.

454
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:50,840
It's Jock's detachment.

455
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:59,680
I suppose now it is
mine, belongs to me and that madman.

456
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,160
Here. Thank you.

457
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:06,720
If you don't like canaries
in cages, why did you get one?

458
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:11,119
Er...so I can set it free.

459
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:13,639
You might think I'm compassionate.

460
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:15,639
Are you not compassionate?

461
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:18,200
No, I don't think I am.

462
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:23,480
To your victories. Ah...

463
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:36,879
Though you look like someone who is
losing.

464
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:41,880
Yes, I am a boy playing a game
while my father watches...

465
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,480
..as he always did.

466
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:48,519
If I don't score the most tries,
or make the most runs,

467
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:51,199
he won't speak to me all
the way home.

468
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:53,799
It's the sound of the car
engine, the windscreen wipers

469
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:56,560
and the thunderous roar
of his silence.

470
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,520
Let's go out for a drink.

471
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:09,919
What's the rush?

472
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:11,159
No rush.

473
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:13,680
Just want to see the sunset
from the balcony of the Empire Club.

474
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:19,840
I would, er, rather stay here.

475
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:23,479
OK.

476
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:25,199
The truth.

477
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:29,880
There's someone I want you to
meet...tonight.

478
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:34,760
Top secret.

479
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:38,359
And there was me thinking
that you were with me

480
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:39,640
because you liked me.

481
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:51,440
I'm trying very hard to only like
you.

482
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:01,560
Come.

483
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:33,080
Owen!

484
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:41,840
Owen?!

485
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:50,999
Your bodies

486
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,360
meet your spirits here, I think.

487
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:17,720
I was going to read you,
Homer or Keats...

488
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:22,199
..but then I thought, fuck that.

489
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:23,559
I think I used to bore you with it.

490
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:25,800
And you were just being polite.

491
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:33,840
You remember that idiotic Percy
French song we used to sing?

492
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:39,320
I'll sing you the Percy French thing
and we'll have a laugh.

493
00:46:56,160 --> 00:47:01,119
# We'll cross the ditch, our leader
said and take the foe in flank

494
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:05,119
# But yells of consternation then
arose from every rank

495
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:08,239
# For posted high upon a tree

496
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:10,599
# We very plainly saw

497
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:14,680
# Trespassers prosecuted in
accordance with the law

498
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:20,159
# We're foiled, exclaimed bold
Slattery

499
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:23,239
# Here ends our grand campaign

500
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:27,480
# Tis merrily throwing life away
to face that mare and drain

501
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:33,240
# Now I'm not as brave as lions
but I'm braver than the hen

502
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:39,600
# And he who fights and runs away
will live to fight again... #

503
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,080
Oh, to run away, eh, Owen?

504
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:55,840
Oh, how grand a life
it would be to be a coward.

505
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:01,240
To love life that much.

506
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:14,240
We'll sleep here tonight, I think.

507
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:35,479
Dear God, I do hope this isn't
your little surprise.

508
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:37,159
Look...

509
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:38,480
No, it isn't.

510
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:41,640
He's seen us. And he's drunk.

511
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:46,759
Stirling. Major Stirling, now, I
hear.

512
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:50,399
Although I believe you personally
have achieved nothing.

513
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:52,959
I have something for you.

514
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:56,159
It seems my phantom regiment
has a new ethos.

515
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:57,720
Who Dares Wins?

516
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:02,039
Where the fuck did you get that?

517
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:05,480
Someone picked it off a barroom
floor after a brawl?

518
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:10,439
My great friend, the Commissariat
of Cairo Police, tells me

519
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:14,599
there were seven fights resulting
in injury across the red light

520
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:19,039
district of Cairo since 10:00
this morning, six of them involving

521
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:21,359
men wearing the SAS beret.

522
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:25,440
Yes, they are men who will not back
down if they are insulted.

523
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:29,359
Oh, I see.

524
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:31,599
And the choice of colour
was deliberate.

525
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:34,559
Mr Clarke, Eve and I are planning
to have dinner.

526
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:37,079
You chose white to provoke
confrontation.

527
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:40,159
You see, my dear, there's
nothing like a barroom brawl

528
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:42,199
to bring men together.

529
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:44,359
Good for company morale.

530
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:47,040
Mr Clarke, I am asking
you politely.

531
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:49,440
Leave us alone.

532
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:53,559
You are a specimen.

533
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:55,279
You've achieved nothing.

534
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:58,480
Yet you have the audacity to
redesign my regiment's jump wings.

535
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:03,920
Thank you for bringing the SAS
into being.

536
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:08,439
Thank you for returning the beret.

537
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:10,000
Now, fuck off.

538
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:19,599
You'd better get her to teach you
some French, old boy.

539
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:24,520
The French are coming your way,
and they are the real deal.

540
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:42,199
What did he mean - French
coming my way?

541
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:43,959
Let's dance.

542
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:45,840
All right.

543
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:14,800
What the fuck is this all about?

544
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:20,839
Auchinleck...

545
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:22,000
..he just arrived.

546
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:29,839
General. Miss Mansour.

547
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:31,800
How do you do? Stirling.

548
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:48,159
A little. Well,
for business,

549
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:52,080
I prefer to use English. General
Auchinleck, what brings you here?

550
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:57,559
Well, your success brings us
here, and Captain Berge's

551
00:51:57,560 --> 00:51:59,199
request for help.

552
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:01,039
Please, allow me.

553
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:03,159
I would not want anyone
to impose upon me,

554
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:05,839
therefore, I don't want
to impose on you.

555
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:07,079
Impose what?

556
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:08,599
I have 20 of

557
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:11,519
the toughest, finest paratroopers
in the French Army,

558
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:13,199
under my command.

559
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:17,439
They're like wild dogs on leashes,
wanting to kill Germans.

560
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:20,479
Well, we want to deploy
them in the desert,

561
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:23,039
but they have to be trained.

562
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:26,040
Our chief training officer
was killed in action.

563
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:28,920
We'll find somebody else.

564
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:32,239
It's all been arranged.

565
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:35,760
We're sending French paratroopers
to join you.

566
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:38,440
Decided by who?

567
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:43,039
This was my idea.

568
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:46,479
And everything up until then
has been part of the strategy.

569
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:49,599
My first priority is the execution
of the war.

570
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:51,080
So is yours.

571
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:57,039
To begin with, you'd only
have to spare one man. Somebody

572
00:52:57,040 --> 00:53:01,559
left behind to train the Free
French in desert warfare.

573
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:04,559
But in order to deal with my wild
dogs, he would have to be

574
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:06,600
a very strong man.

575
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:13,119
When would this deployment begin?

576
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:15,039
Good man.

577
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:17,319
Come on, have a drink.
Can we get some chairs?

578
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:23,400
Miss Mansour, you must tell me
all about your last few days...

579
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:07,840
PIANO PLAYS

580
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:28,920
Did you find him?

581
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:34,360
Yep.

582
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:37,560
Paddy...

583
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:48,960
..GHQ are sending us a detachment
of French paratroopers.

584
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:52,200
We don't need many more men.

585
00:54:55,960 --> 00:55:00,039
Well, it's a direct order
from Auchinleck himself, a favour

586
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:02,720
to Charles de Gaulle, promised
by Winston Churchill.

587
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:09,079
But we would need someone
to train them.

588
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:10,559
Someone with experience.

589
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:12,719
Someone to set up a training camp.

590
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:15,839
Train them to fight in this oven
made of sand, you see.

591
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:17,440
Who?

592
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:20,840
Well...

593
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:25,479
..with Jock gone...

594
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:28,920
..there is no-one else experienced
enough or tough enough.

595
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:34,120
I've decided it has to be you.

596
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:44,560
So I stay in Jalo while you continue
to go out on missions?

597
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:52,679
Yes, of course, we will
continue our campaign.

598
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:55,000
So the loser finds a way to win.

599
00:55:56,680 --> 00:56:02,279
You know, my old dad, Irish
from both sides, stabbed from both

600
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:05,159
sides by men like you.

601
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:06,519
Landowning gentry.

602
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:08,159
Paddy, there is no-one else..

603
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:10,519
He said to me about life
as a common man,

604
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:11,720
he said...

605
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:18,239
You don't deserve my father's
wisdom.

606
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:20,399
Right. Well, listen, Paddy.

607
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:24,039
Oh - sometimes
when you are in command,

608
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:27,119
you need to make difficult
decisions.

609
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:30,280
Not play the fucking piano and go
sightseeing in the desert.

610
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:50,160
GUNSHOTS

611
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:11,440
We're fucked.
