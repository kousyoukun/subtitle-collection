1
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:16,359
Tonight, James asks a girl
for a favour. No.

2
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:18,919
Richard listens to a man.

3
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:21,440
And I polish a bishop.

4
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,999
Hello, good evening!

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,719
Hello, thank you, everybody,
thank you. Now.

6
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:37,679
New cars come out so fast
these days,

7
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,759
sometimes it is difficult
to keep up.

8
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:44,279
Nissan, for example, said the other
day that over the next six years,

9
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,719
they will be bringing out
a new model every six weeks.

10
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:50,919
Happily, however,
there are some car companies,

11
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:53,839
usually Italian ones,
that won't be rushed.

12
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,279
That like to take their time,
have some lunch.

13
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,519
And nobody is better at this
than Lamborghini,

14
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:03,440
as Richard Hammond
shall now explain.

15
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,599
When it comes to
their big V12 cars,

16
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,879
their flagship battle cruisers,

17
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:21,160
Lamborghini really, really like
to take their time.

18
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,399
Just these four - the Miura,

19
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,400
the Countash, the Diablo...

20
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,279
and the Murcielago,
span half a century.

21
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,520
And now, at last, there's a new one.

22
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,920
It's called the Aventador.

23
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:47,439
It costs £248,000.

24
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:51,039
And it's the closest thing
to a stealth fighter jet

25
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,240
that you'll ever see on the road.

26
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,480
It even has a starter button
that's straight out of Top Gun.

27
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:16,599
The current boss of Lamborghini
said recently that in the old days,

28
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:20,679
the order of priority for Lamborghini
was top speed, acceleration,

29
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,480
and handling, in that order.

30
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,839
The thing is, for this car,

31
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,159
he says that order
is the other way round.

32
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,079
Handling comes first, with top speed
being given a lower priority.

33
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,920
So, let's find out just how low
a priority that is, shall we?

34
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Whooooa! Waaaah-hah!

35
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,519
0 to 60, 2.9 seconds.

36
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:52,640
So they still care
about acceleration, then!

37
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,839
220 kilometres an hour,

38
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,120
250!

39
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,560
260!

40
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,400
270. 280 kilometres.

41
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,359
Oh!

42
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,279
290 kilometres an hour.

43
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,960
Oh my God!

44
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,600
Oh, OK, and relax.

45
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:24,000
If that's them giving top speed
a low priority, bring it on!

46
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:29,999
Flat out,
the Aventador will do 217 mph...

47
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,400
which makes it faster
than the old Murcielago.

48
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,799
How Italian is that?

49
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:42,320
No top speed, OK,
270, no more, no more than that!

50
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:51,320
This pulverising performance
comes courtesy of the Aventador's
massive 6.5 litre engine...

51
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:56,919
their first all-new V12
for almost 50 years.

52
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:00,560
But what's surprising is that
they bothered to make one at all.

53
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,119
You see, these days,
a lot of carmakers are shying away
from bigger engines.

54
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,479
BMW's new M5, for example,
will have a V8 instead of a V10.

55
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,119
AMG are ditching V12s
in favour of V8s.

56
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,399
It's called moving with the times.

57
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,159
But that's not so easy
with a big Lamborghini.

58
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,559
A V12 is kind of its signature dish,
it defines the car.

59
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,599
And the engineers insisted that
whatever happened with the Aventador,

60
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,719
it had to have a V12.

61
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,920
And, of course, the by-product
of a V12 is lots of horsepowers.

62
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:43,400
This has got 691 of them,
which in Top Gear maths is 700.

63
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,599
That power is fed to all four wheels

64
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,319
through a unique design
of flappy paddle gearbox.

65
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:56,719
It can change in less than
50 milliseconds, which...

66
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,240
I can't demonstrate that
even if I blink an eye.

67
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,239
There are other
high-tech features too.

68
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:06,599
We're in strada mode right now,
which is for the road.

69
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,080
Let's put it in corsa, track mode.

70
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,120
Whoa, hang on!

71
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,840
All right, fella, all right!

72
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:23,280
That's absolutely brutal!
It kicks you in the back of the head.

73
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,559
And now we're in corsa mode,

74
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,559
let's find out how they've got on
with their new number-one priority...

75
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,800
handling.

76
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:38,519
Traditionally, always the scariest
part of testing a big Lambo.

77
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,680
OK, here we go, I'm nervous.

78
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,560
I'm OK.

79
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,160
Still on the track.

80
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,079
I'm in a V12 Lambo, I just threw it
at a corner at insane speed,

81
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,800
and it went round.

82
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:12,479
So why am I not buried in row 85
of that 747?

83
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:17,359
This is partly because the grip
is just unbelievable.

84
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,479
Also it's got push-rod suspension
which is very clever,

85
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:24,280
and unheard of in an road car -
that's F1 stuff.

86
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:30,239
So even when it's coming under
some pressure, like that,

87
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,599
the steering is just...

88
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,240
It's just... I'm turning a dial.

89
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:42,239
So, whilst the Aventador
looks as Miami Vice mental

90
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:47,400
as everything else in its family
tree, it's now a serious player.

91
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:53,399
The noise it makes is spirited
rather than deafening.

92
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,679
The chassis is made from
carbon fibre, not pig iron.

93
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,199
The air-conditioning works.

94
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:03,840
It's a proper car,
rather than a machine that wants,
most of all, to kill you.

95
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:08,560
And that makes me a bit sad.

96
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:13,759
Basically, what's missing
is that Lambo fear factor,

97
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:17,439
that knot in the stomach test pilots
must have felt in the '50s

98
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:21,320
when they headed for the sound
barrier in unproven jet aircraft.

99
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:26,360
Of course,
you might think that's a good thing.

100
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,840
To be honest, I'm not so sure.

101
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:35,840
If a big Lamborghini
is all about pantomime, drama,
theatre, which it is...

102
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,359
then I want people watching

103
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,399
not just to go, "Wow,
that's a stunning-looking thing."

104
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:47,159
I want them to look at me inside
and think, "Whoa, there goes
Chuck Yeager Hammond.

105
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:51,239
"He's brave."
But in this, I'm not being brave.

106
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:55,319
It's as easy to drive as a big Audi,
that's the truth of it.

107
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:59,519
I finally understand what they mean
by that, is it Helsinki syndrome?

108
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,479
When people who've been kidnapped,

109
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:04,600
when they're released,
miss their kidnappers.

110
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:10,039
I don't know that I want to be
in a big, loud V12 Lambo

111
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:13,919
that doesn't every now and again
try and kill me.

112
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,800
I miss that.

113
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,199
Very good.
It's beautiful but it's just not...

114
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,359
I think he made a mistake.

115
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:33,119
Hammond... Whoa, hang on, hang on.

116
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,679
Hammond, did you say, did you say
Helsinki syndrome? Yes, I did.

117
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,280
You mean Stockholm syndrome.

118
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:45,399
Yes I do. Yes.
What is Helsinki syndrome?

119
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:48,719
I think it's when you're an idiot
and get your syndromes mixed up.

120
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,000
Yeah, I've got it.

121
00:08:50,001 --> 00:08:55,199
Anyway, the Lamborghini.
What you're saying is, it would be
better if it were a bit worse.

122
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,279
No, it's like that McLaren MP4-12C
you drove the other week.

123
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,119
It is brilliant, undeniably.

124
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:04,199
But somehow it's just not exciting
enough. He's right, actually.

125
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,679
I've driven this as well
and it isn't boring

126
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:10,559
but it somehow lacks that sort of
Lamborghini theatre.

127
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,519
It's too refined
and it's sort of too clever.

128
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:16,399
It's as though Lamborghini
are trying to be Ferrari

129
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,919
instead of making cars
specifically for...

130
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,639
Lunatics. Rod Stewart. Fish.

131
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,959
Tadpoles. What?
No, people who like a laugh.

132
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:28,079
A Lamborghini should be
an instrument of terror
and this just isn't.

133
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,999
Well, now, let's examine
the scale of their failure

134
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,519
by seeing how fast
it goes round our track.

135
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:36,319
That means handing it over
to our tame racing driver.

136
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,079
Some say that his favourite T-shirt

137
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:43,319
has a picture on the front
of a T-shirt.

138
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:47,559
And that he spent all week waiting
for a big cheque from the Germans,

139
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:50,719
because he too has spent
the last 2,000 years

140
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,720
sitting on his backside
doing absolutely nothing at all.

141
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,560
All we know is,
he's called The Stig.

142
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:03,799
And he's off! Ooh, I love that pop
as it shifts up.

143
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,959
Single rather than double
clutch system.

144
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:10,839
Changes are still lightning-fast
as he spears into the first corner.

145
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:14,679
Wobble under braking, shows how much
speed he's already carrying.

146
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:17,079
He's got it all together
for the exit.

147
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:24,039
Stig listening to Petula Clark
in French, very unusual.

148
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:28,039
Clean through Chicago.
Coming up now to Hammerhead.

149
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,719
Despite carbon fibre construction,
this is still a big, heavy car.

150
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,319
Will it get out of shape?
Not a bit of it.

151
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,399
None of the traditional
Lambo flamboyance there.

152
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,439
Now, follow-through, the spoiler
fully extends at 80 miles an hour.

153
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,559
He's doing a lot more than that now.

154
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:55,679
Fast through the tyres,
just two corners left.

155
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,719
Here he comes now.
Hard on the ceramic brakes,

156
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,399
an old V12 Lambo would have
bitten him in the face by now.

157
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,480
Through Gambon
and across the line.

158
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,280
Now...

159
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,400
Now, if we look here...

160
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,399
this is the old Lamborghini,
the Murcielago,

161
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:19,560
the LP670 did it in 1:19.
Here's the Aventador.

162
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:25,079
Ooooooh...

163
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:28,639
1:16.5.

164
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:36,359
That's interesting, isn't it?

165
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:42,119
So... So it looks
absolutely fantastic.

166
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:46,759
And it's faster round our track
than a Bugatti Veyron Super Sport.

167
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:50,400
And I think it's clear now
why Hammond and May hate it so much.

168
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,999
He's no idea. He knows what
we're on about, he does know.

169
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,359
Right, it's time for us to do
the news and we begin with this.

170
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,199
Attention morons everywhere.

171
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,639
Mercedes have a new hardcore
AMG version of one of their cars.

172
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:09,359
It's from their especially ridiculous
range of black editions.

173
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,399
Oh, now, I'm sorry,
this is a car for connoisseurs.

174
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:18,519
It's a car for idiots. It's
for people who know the difference
between Sweden and Finland.

175
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,239
Yes, all right, sorry.

176
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,559
This is the new black edition
of the C-class.

177
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:27,999
It will cost you £110,000.
It's got the old 6.2 litre V8,

178
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,119
tuned version of that, rather than
the twin turbo AMG engines of today.

179
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,199
You also get the seven-speed
flappy paddle gearbox from an SLS.

180
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:41,879
But I think it looks fantastic.
Ridiculous. It's fantastic!

181
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,559
I think it looks infantile.

182
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,239
It does.

183
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:49,599
James, you are so old, you think
Werther's Originals are infantile.

184
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:54,239
Can I just clarify this a little bit?
He has got the old CLK black.

185
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,799
Yes, I do. And I went in it
the other day.

186
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,519
And you loved it. I hated it!

187
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:04,279
It's ridiculous! The ride is stupid.

188
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:08,039
It's like being in a touring car.
What's wrong with that?

189
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:11,799
Nothing at all,
if you're, I don't know, let's say,
in a touring car race.

190
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:16,359
If you want to use it,
let's imagine, on a road,

191
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,800
in, let's say, the world,

192
00:13:17,801 --> 00:13:22,559
it's absolutely stupid.
It's a terrible car. You may mock...

193
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,719
Thank you, it's ridiculous.

194
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:29,719
The fact is, the fact is, that
the CLK black is holding its value

195
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:32,759
a lot better than, I don't know,
911s that you two have.

196
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:36,079
Because they only sold 100 of them.
Yes, they did.

197
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:39,079
They'd have sold more but most
of the people who bought them

198
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:42,039
were wearing those jackets
that do up at the back.

199
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:45,399
They were only out for the day.
"I want one of those!"

200
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:49,199
Like that. They'd eaten the pens
you use to fill the options form in.

201
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:53,959
It's a stupid car. It is a
stupid car. It's ridiculous.

202
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:57,239
Oh, don't feel sorry for him!
Look at the wheel arches on it!

203
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,959
Aaaah!

204
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:03,399
Let's move on.
Yes, let's move on. Now...

205
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,479
we have been sent, by a viewer,

206
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:08,359
a copy of a motorcycling magazine
from 1976.

207
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:11,239
We have a picture of it here,
the front cover.

208
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,479
Sort of thing you love,
isn't it, James?

209
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:16,359
Mmm. Lovely.
What distressed us greatly was,

210
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:20,719
there was an advertisement on
the back page, for some leathers.

211
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,519
And it was the model that was
being used that has terrified us.

212
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,239
Here it is.

213
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:37,640
Now... don't say that isn't you,
look!

214
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:43,359
1976! Is that 1976? 1976.

215
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,319
There is no point denying that
it's you. He's wearing brown shoes.

216
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,959
It's got to be you. It is you.

217
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:53,839
You looked exactly the same in 1976
as... When were you born?!

218
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:58,359
I was only 12!
You weren't, though, were you?

219
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:02,439
You know, I have speculated many,
many, many times over the years

220
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:06,119
on what sort of a man
appears as a model in leather.

221
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:11,679
Yeah. You've let the motorcycling
side down there, badly.

222
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,359
Lewis Hamilton has been
in the news this week

223
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:17,319
saying that the national anthem
is too short.

224
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,839
He can't milk it on the podium,
it's over in 44 seconds.

225
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:22,639
He says it's not fair,
because when Massa wins,

226
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:27,479
who's Brazilian, that national
anthem goes on for 16 hours.

227
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,879
So I've had an idea.

228
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,879
Why don't we change
our national anthem

229
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,599
to Wish You Were Here, Pink Floyd.

230
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,759
27 minutes... Of hell.
It isn't hell.

231
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,479
The problem isn't that ours
is too short,

232
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,759
it's that everybody else's
is too long.

233
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:44,599
The Greek one is. 158 verses. What?!

234
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:47,879
I promise you.
The Greek national anthem...

235
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:51,839
How many times can you say,
"We're completely screwed"?

236
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:54,919
So you're saying ours is too...
They're all too long.

237
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:59,439
I think we could set an example
to the world, actually, with
the Olympics coming up in 2012

238
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,400
by making national anthems shorter.

239
00:16:01,401 --> 00:16:04,199
We could get ours pared
right down.

240
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:07,279
What, "we hope she's victorious
and lives a long time." No.

241
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:10,079
That's too long. Not very long.

242
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,439
I'm thinking more along
the lines of...

243
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,759
There you go.

244
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,959
So he gets up on the podium and...

245
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:21,359
Exactly. You'd have to have
the roll on the drums
so that people got ready.

246
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:28,320
That's quick, I like it.
That is actually a brilliant idea.

247
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,119
Last year, my CLK Mercedes...

248
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:38,119
Stupid, stupid car.
With stupid wheel arches.

249
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,799
You may think it's stupid,
but it's very determined.

250
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,999
My CLK, it said one day
when I got in it,

251
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,879
"24 days until the next service."

252
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,559
I mentioned this on the programme
a year ago.

253
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:50,519
I thought, I wonder what will happen
if I take it to 25 days.

254
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:55,880
Its German brain won't be able
to compute the fact that somebody
has disobeyed a direct order.

255
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:01,919
Thing was, on the 24th day,
Mercedes turned up while I was out

256
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:06,959
and took it away for a service,
which really annoyed me. Good news.

257
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:10,639
Yesterday, it suddenly said,
"Nine days until service due."

258
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,839
What I've done this time is
I've parked it

259
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,599
in a London underground garage

260
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,039
and I'm not going to tell anybody
which one.

261
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:22,439
I want to see what happens
when it goes to minus one.

262
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:25,559
No! That's dangerous. It could panic,

263
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,999
like a horse in a stable,
and just go mad.

264
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,119
Or it's probably already been
building a glider so it can escape.

265
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:35,639
That's why I've put it
in an underground car park

266
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:38,639
and not a multi-storey,
so it can't fly away.

267
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,559
It's probably been specially
trained to take a cyanide pill.

268
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:45,119
It's hidden it in one of its
massive wheel arches.

269
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,399
"I must end it now!"

270
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,840
So when I go back to it,
you think it'll be dead?

271
00:17:49,841 --> 00:17:51,400
Completely.

272
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:56,359
Last week, we had the Lotus T125
down here.

273
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,639
It's kind of a Formula 1 car
that you can buy

274
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,679
if you have £650,000 lying around.

275
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:05,079
We wondered how fast it would go
around our track,

276
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:09,039
whether it would be faster
than an actual Formula One car.

277
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:12,119
Sadly on the day we were going to try
for a lap, it was raining.

278
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:15,599
So we said we'd bring it back
when it wasn't. We have.

279
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,919
And it isn't.
Did that make sense?

280
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,200
I know what you mean.

281
00:18:19,201 --> 00:18:22,320
Anyway,
let's find out how it got on.

282
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,760
Away he goes.
Lighting up the back tyres a treat.

283
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,359
Not quite the sound of an F1 car.
Not as high-pitched.

284
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,199
That is the sound of torque.

285
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,359
The first corner.

286
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:40,119
The Stig sawing away at the wheel.
It is an animal, this thing.

287
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,120
Down the gears, into Chicago.

288
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,359
Wrestling it through there.

289
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:49,559
Stig actually demanded
a softer chassis set-up

290
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,519
and a softer tyres for today.

291
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,239
Will it have enough heat
in those tyres

292
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,559
to cling on through Hammerhead?

293
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:59,199
Yes, he does. Bit of a wiggle there.

294
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,679
Now he can really open it up.
Through the follow-through.

295
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:06,959
Stationary,
this car weighs 640 kilos.

296
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,119
Flat out, thanks to the air pressing
down on those wings,

297
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:14,479
it weighs two-and-a-quarter tonnes.
Coming up to the penultimate corner,

298
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,799
hard on the brakes.

299
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,319
Crackle on the over-run
up to Gambon,

300
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,879
Stig still working hard.
And across the line.

301
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,919
Now...

302
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:30,159
the actual Formula 1 car
we had down here a few years ago,

303
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,719
that did it in 59 seconds.

304
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:39,079
The T125 did it
in 1 minute 3.8.

305
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:43,519
So it's about four seconds a lap
slower than the Renault F1 car,

306
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:47,079
which means it's the same pace
as a current Lotus F1 car.

307
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:53,799
The fact is that the electric car
is very much with us.

308
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:58,839
You can actually go into
a dealership and simply buy one
but the big question is, should you?

309
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:02,119
What are the pitfalls?
What are the advantages?

310
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:05,479
To find out, James and I decided
to do a sensible test.

311
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:09,479
No clocking about, no catching fire,
no Richard Hammond.

312
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:14,279
We would simply get two of the cars
that you can actually buy these days

313
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:18,280
and take them on a perfectly
ordinary run to the seaside.

314
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:23,439
This is the Nissan Leaf

315
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,879
and there are no visual clues
that it's powered by electricity.

316
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,559
It looks like every other
five-door hatchback.

317
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:33,839
It also drives like every other
five-door hatchback,

318
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:38,039
except the engine doesn't shout
or bellow or roar.

319
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:42,559
It just sort of... hums, like a monk.

320
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,200
Hmmmmmmm.

321
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:50,359
Peugeot has gone down
a different styling route.

322
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:54,879
Their new electric car, the Ion,
is designed to look futuristic

323
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,759
and different and unusual.

324
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:02,759
But, just like the Nissan,
it is like a car.

325
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:05,759
Here I am driving along
the A46 towards Cleethorpes

326
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:09,960
and the situation
is completely normal.

327
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:16,559
Clarkson, May. Yeah, what?
Is your Nissan like a car?

328
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,679
Yes, nothing to see here.

329
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:22,719
And as I said before,
nothing to hear.

330
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,879
This car is so quiet,

331
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,039
they had to design a special
windscreen wiper motor for it

332
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:31,879
because the one they fit in
all other Nissan's was too loud.

333
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:34,919
They had a similar problem
with the door mirrors

334
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:40,159
cos as you were driving all you
could hear was the air rushing
over them, not a nice sound.

335
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,319
So they've sculpted the head lamps

336
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,640
to deflect air away
from the mirrors.

337
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,959
So, what about performance?

338
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:52,159
The top speed
is only 81 miles an hour.

339
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,959
And 0-60 takes something
like 16 seconds.

340
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,599
It doesn't feel like
you're a liability on the roads.

341
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:01,479
It doesn't feel like I'm holding
people up or anything like that.

342
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:05,079
The Nissan has
a much bigger electric motor.

343
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:08,599
It develops the equivalent
of 108 brake horsepower.

344
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,719
That means a top speed
of 90 miles an hour

345
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,199
and sufficient acceleration
to consider,

346
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,559
at least, overtaking someone.

347
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:19,279
James for example. Here we go.

348
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:22,639
One problem I have with electric
cars is they're not very heroic.

349
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,999
"Quick, James, I have the antidote.

350
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,239
"We need to be at the hospital
in 20 minutes.

351
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,839
"Only you can save me."

352
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,439
Hmmmmm...

353
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,199
You may regret that.

354
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:39,639
68, 69 miles an hour. 70.

355
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:42,799
- Or let me put it this way.
- 70.

356
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:48,079
Soon we pulled over
to examine our cars more closely.

357
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,479
I want to see what it is
that's making no noise,

358
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,479
that's humming like a Trappist monk.

359
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:56,599
Oh, that's an electric, is that an
electric...

360
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:59,759
that's an electric motor, is it?
It must be.

361
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,999
And one moving part.
Effectively, yes. And no gearbox.

362
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,680
And there's no fuel tank so you
get a big boot. That's not bad.

363
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:13,159
What's that for?
Solar panel. Is it? Yes.

364
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,679
It's a £260 option
which means you could use

365
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,799
the air-conditioning while parked,

366
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:21,919
so you don't drain the main
batteries. Very clever. I like that.

367
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:25,319
'The Peugeot, though,
is even cleverer.'

368
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:29,159
Where's the engine?
Ah, it's in the back. Is it?

369
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:34,639
It's rear-engined, rear-wheel drive.
It's a 911. It is a 911.

370
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,839
This is what the 911 will look like
in another 10 - 15 years' time.

371
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,320
So the engine's in there.

372
00:23:39,321 --> 00:23:41,959
It's under there,
the batteries are under there.

373
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:45,079
That's not a very big boot.
You wouldn't get a dog in there.

374
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:48,759
Discussing luggage space is like
I'm back on old Top Gear.

375
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,639
Can I get a beard?

376
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,279
So far then,
all seems well with these cars.

377
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:56,439
But they're not what
you'd call cheap.

378
00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:00,599
The Nissan is £30,990.

379
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:04,079
Nearly twice what you'd pay
for a normal car of this size.

380
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,119
The Peugeot is even more expensive,

381
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:11,600
£33,155.

382
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:17,839
Yes, with both you get £5,000 back
from the Government

383
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,959
but even with that,
they're not good value.

384
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,399
Mine isn't even very well equipped.

385
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,439
Have you got Sat Nav in your car,
James?

386
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:29,319
No, I haven't. Have you?
Yes. Cruise control?

387
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:33,759
No. So that's £3,000 more expensive
than this

388
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:37,239
and isn't as well-equipped
or as big?

389
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,119
And what's more,

390
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:43,520
the Leaf can even deliver your own
personal Greenpeace lecture.

391
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,119
It's talking!

392
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:50,279
'By the 12th of May,
electric cars worldwide

393
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,639
'saved a total
of 344,000 eco-trees.'

394
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:57,159
What!? 'And 659 tonnes
of carbon-dioxide has been reduced.'

395
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:01,759
What does that mean? What's an
eco-tree? What are you saying?

396
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:06,199
Still, there is an upside
to the nagging and the cost.

397
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:10,599
These days eco-ism is seen as cool.

398
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:14,719
People like James May and me,
petrol heads, we're dinosaurs.

399
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,759
If you have one of these cars
with zero emission

400
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,759
and full electric plastered
down the side,

401
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:23,119
you are more likely
to get a girlfriend.

402
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,679
You just have to hope
she doesn't live

403
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,879
at the other end of the country.

404
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:31,879
James, can I just ask,
what range do you have left?

405
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:35,319
I have 19 miles.

406
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:39,519
I was down to 14 miles.
So, as is the way with all cars,

407
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:43,439
we decided to buy some go juice
in the next town,

408
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,439
which turned out to be Lincoln.

409
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:50,479
And then I realised we might be
there for quite a while.

410
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:54,999
James, I have another read-out
on my dashboard.

411
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,199
Guess how long it will take

412
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,559
to charge this up to 100%
fully charged?

413
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:03,519
Well, a few hours I suppose.
Is it?

414
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:07,239
'11 hours.' What?!

415
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,479
By the time we reached
the city centre,

416
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:12,479
my range was down to seven miles.

417
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:17,599
So I looked on the Sat Nav for
the nearest official charging point.

418
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:23,359
The nearest charging space
it gives me is 45 miles away.

419
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,999
I can only go seven.

420
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,559
That's very useful function
you've got there!

421
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:31,719
OK, Covent Garden car park.
77 miles away.

422
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:34,480
'What possible use is that?!'

423
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:40,679
We pulled in at the council offices
to see if they could help.

424
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:44,359
Do you have any idea where we can
charge electric cars up in Lincoln?

425
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:46,519
Electric cars...

426
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:49,959
It just needs a socket, really.
You do, don't you?

427
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:52,839
'We didn't have to wait long
for an answer.'

428
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:58,119
I checked with our team,
there are definitely no points within
Lincolnshire. Not in Lincolnshire?

429
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:01,119
Who's pushing who?

430
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:05,839
'Various people suggested friends
who might be able to help

431
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,159
'but they were all too far away.'

432
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:11,880
32 miles. 32? 32 miles.

433
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,519
So, we stopped at a restaurant
in the marina

434
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:18,119
to ask if we could buy
some of their electricity.

435
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:22,479
Use some of your charm.
It will begin with the word "hello".

436
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:25,079
Ready? "Hello." Hello.

437
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:29,159
We were just wondering,
we're trying to...
We've got two electric cars.

438
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,959
Right.

439
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,639
James has a way with women.

440
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,839
I should imagine he'll be able
to talk her into it, no problem.

441
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:38,520
..it's going to take 12 hours.

442
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:43,959
No.

443
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:46,599
James, I do apologise,

444
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:49,759
those boats must be getting power
from the shore.

445
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,280
Yes, they'll have plugs
like caravan sites do.

446
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:56,519
Getting to the boat park
meant more driving,

447
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:59,919
so now my car was saying it would
need 13 hours to charge up.

448
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:04,439
'Very low battery charge. Search for
nearest charging station.'

449
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:09,199
You're just wasting electricity
telling me that.

450
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,959
I've only got four miles left,
Jeremy must be running on

451
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,919
whatever the equivalent of empty is
for a battery.

452
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:19,119
We've just got to stop somewhere
and beg for the use of a socket.

453
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,559
'Hello, that's it.'

454
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:22,279
That's it, that's it.

455
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:24,320
Oh, not there.

456
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:29,839
This is the future
of motoring here.

457
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,599
This is all of you lives here.

458
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,239
This is what's going to become
of you all.

459
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:38,239
Obviously, the solution would be
to get a tow from James.

460
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:42,759
However... "Do not tow this vehicle
with all four wheels on the ground.

461
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:46,799
"This may cause serious
and expensive damage to the motor."

462
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,199
Thank you.

463
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:53,439
Thankfully, some of the large crowd
we'd attracted
kindly pushed me to the boat park.

464
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,480
However...

465
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,119
I can see two problems with this.

466
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:00,080
You have got to get across
that water.

467
00:29:00,081 --> 00:29:02,439
And the other one is...
It's too short. Yes.

468
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,640
We'll have to push it
somewhere else.

469
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:09,959
So, once more, we appealed
to the good people of Lincoln

470
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:15,640
who pushed me to the university
where, finally,
we found somewhere to charge up.

471
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,919
See that,
blue light on the dashboard.

472
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:23,399
When all three are flashing,
it's fully charged. OK? Right.

473
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:30,599
We now had a 13-hour wait but,
thankfully, we were in the
magnificent city of Lincoln,

474
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:33,239
where there are many things
to see and do.

475
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:35,960
I like a good cathedral.

476
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,639
I would never normally
be brass rubbing

477
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:43,239
and do you know why
I've never done it?

478
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:46,599
All the cars I've ever owned have
been powered by petrol or diesel.

479
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:49,399
Look, it's Hammond,
only in a diving bell.

480
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:52,200
It does look a bit like Hammond,
actually.

481
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,839
Lincoln Castle was founded
by William the Conqueror 1068,

482
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,079
two years after the Norman Conquest.

483
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:03,239
You can't build a stone castle
on the earth and banks,

484
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:07,039
initially, you have to wait
for the banks to compact down.

485
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:09,959
That is the best building
in the world. Really?

486
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:14,240
For a department store, that's
a fantastic piece of architecture.

487
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:19,879
What's he doing?
I'm doing an abstract floor rubbing.

488
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:22,119
Look at that,
that's quite interesting.

489
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,959
Basically, in the Ice Age,

490
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,759
the Lincolnshire edge -
a big lump of limestone.

491
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:30,279
Do you know what this hill
is called? Hill?

492
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:34,680
No. Steep Hill. Is it?
Yes, it really is.
They spent ages thinking of that.

493
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,439
Can you see the square frontage?

494
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,719
Yeah. There's a square within
the square. Yeah.

495
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:43,560
That is like a Norman
fortified building...

496
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,759
You know Nissan are going
to start putting

497
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:50,599
fast-charge points
at all their dealerships?

498
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:53,239
You'll be able to charge your
car up in 30 minutes. Hmm.

499
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:55,680
The problem is, do that all
the time, then you could

500
00:30:55,681 --> 00:30:59,319
ruin the battery pack
in three years.

501
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:01,959
Yeah, how much is a new battery
pack? £7,000.

502
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:04,359
Really? Actually, Nissan
can't say how much,

503
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:07,959
but we rang an expert.
He said, in today's money, £7,000.

504
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:12,079
How long do they think batteries
last if you charge them
slowly and don't thrash them?

505
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:15,639
If you charge them up when
they're half empty, rather than

506
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:20,239
letting them get all the way
flat, maximum, ten years.

507
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:25,039
Possibly five.
It's not that long, is it? No.

508
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:28,759
Are you going to go?
I can't go, actually.

509
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:32,720
Since you put that in...
my word doesn't fit any more.

510
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:40,160
As evening fell, we really were
running out of things to do.

511
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:46,719
I think mine's worked quite well.
Yeah, not bad. Hurt like hell.

512
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:49,599
Is mine all right? Look.

513
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:54,360
What is it? What does it say?

514
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,120
What?

515
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:05,719
The next morning, after the longest
refuelling stop in history,

516
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:08,240
we set out once more for
Cleethorpes.

517
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:16,320
'As of the 12th May,
your energy economy was
0.1 kilowatt hours per mile.'

518
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:24,519
The cost of charging this up
at the University with its
cheap deal was £2.34.

519
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:27,399
But, if you charge it up during
the day, depending on

520
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:33,279
who your supplier is
and what deal you've done,
it could cost you £8.30.

521
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:37,400
That's £8.30 to do -
it says - 100 miles.

522
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:42,599
To do 100 miles in a Golf BlueMotion
diesel will cost about the same.

523
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:48,039
But remember, the Golf is
over £7,000 cheaper to buy.

524
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:51,759
And its fuel tank is unlikely
to be worn out after five years.

525
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:55,159
There are other issues, too.

526
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:57,839
One of the problems
with the electric car is

527
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:02,159
you drive constantly
as if on an economy run, because a
part of your brain is acutely aware

528
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:05,799
that when it's gone,
you're in for a big wait.

529
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:08,439
It will get different.
They'll have quick charging,

530
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:11,079
three-phase charging,
batteries will improve, yes.

531
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:15,719
But today, with this car on sale,
you simply have to accept

532
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:18,680
that you're going to learn a lot
of medieval history.

533
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:23,639
Plus you really do need to be able
to work out where you'll be

534
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:25,679
when the charge runs out.

535
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,359
And that's not easy.

536
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:30,919
So I've now done 26 miles
since I set off

537
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:34,680
but I've lost 40 miles of range.

538
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:40,159
Interesting. I've also done 26 miles
but this is the bit you'll like,

539
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:42,120
I've gained two miles of range.

540
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:48,039
A lot of people think I have
a downer on the electric motor.

541
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:50,079
I don't. Nothing wrong
with it at all.

542
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:54,119
Theoretically, it could be immensely
powerful. And I like the Leaf.

543
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:57,279
Beautifully made, is very quiet.
It's extremely comfortable.

544
00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:00,639
And spacious. Good car.

545
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:04,719
But the batteries it uses
have to be recharged from the mains

546
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:07,119
and I don't think that's the answer.

547
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:12,119
I think that what I'm actually
driving is a squariel
or a laser disc

548
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:13,600
or a Beta tape machine.

549
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:20,799
Batteries? Batteries are rubbish.
Batteries are rubbish in everything.

550
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,679
Think of all the things
that are battery-powered.

551
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:27,199
Torches and mobile phones
and digital cameras and laptops.

552
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:31,440
I bet you, they're all either
completely flat or going flat
very quickly.

553
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:37,639
Eventually we arrived
in Cleethorpes.

554
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:39,600
We've made it to the seaside.

555
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,560
And it was on the dodgems
that we had an epiphany.

556
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:56,319
This is an electric car.
But it has no on-board battery.

557
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:59,479
It takes its power from
the chicken wire in the roof.

558
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:02,159
Yes, all we have to do, really,
is put chicken wire

559
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:05,079
above all the motorways
and dual carriageways in Britain.

560
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:08,639
You drive to your nearest one,
extend the pole on
the back of your car,

561
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,959
and off you go driving on the mains.

562
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:14,319
It gets better than that, you know,
because if the traffic's

563
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:18,119
really busy on the motorway,
the government could just
cut the power a bit

564
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:20,919
and everyone would go slowly,
then if it was empty they

565
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:23,119
increase the power
and everyone goes fast.

566
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:26,519
Actually if there was an accident
or some bad congestion ahead

567
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:30,479
they could just turn it off
and everybody would glide to
a safe halt at the same rate.

568
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,479
We have solved it.

569
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,399
We have solved it.

570
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:39,559
If you think about it,
if you're driving along the motorway
and you're really bored,

571
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:42,999
you could just deliberately crash
into someone to amuse yourself.

572
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,919
That's true. Motorways are
boring, aren't they? Exactly.

573
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:48,679
So you just drive along doing this
to the man next to you...

574
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:51,200
These cars, then,
are not the future.

575
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:57,119
But they did at least bring us
to where the future lies.

576
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,639
Oh, no, I've got oversteer.

577
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:02,079
Nobody does this deliberately
on the motorway. Do they?

578
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,839
Er... What? Chaps.

579
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:16,719
So, you are proposing a sort of
chicken-wire grid above all of

580
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:19,999
the nation's motorways. Have you
two completely lost your minds?

581
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,159
Bringing you out in
a Helsinki syndrome?

582
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:25,239
Yeah, it's itching. It's bad,
it is. It is a brilliant idea.

583
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:28,639
I've had another one. It's based on
the London tube network.

584
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:31,079
It's electrified roads.
Yeah, brilliant.

585
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:34,160
I'll just cross the road to that shop
there. Dzzzz. It's a stupid idea.

586
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:39,439
I've had an even better idea.
What about, you fit a car with
a special tank,

587
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:43,799
into which you put
a flammable liquid.

588
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:47,999
When the liquid runs out,
you pull into, let's call it
a petrol station, fill it up

589
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,239
in a couple of minutes, and you'd
never have to go brass rubbing.

590
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,679
I think that might catch on.
But seriously,

591
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:57,559
what are we all going to do
when the oil finally becomes

592
00:36:57,560 --> 00:37:01,359
too expensive to use for personal
transport? Which it will.

593
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:06,639
Well, it's tricky, the government
recently said that there will
never be a charge point.

594
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:10,039
On every street corner
so you will be reduced
to going to universities...

595
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:12,199
and that's not practical -
like what we did.

596
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:17,839
And you can't use a hybrid
because that uses a petrol engine
to charge up the batteries.

597
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:22,439
So, we're going to have to have
a whole new approach. Dodgems.

598
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:25,319
No, Honda are already there.
It's hydrogen. It has to be.

599
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:27,679
Truth be told, it is hydrogen.

600
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:30,999
Yes, but isn't hydrogen very
complicated to work out?

601
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,799
Yes, but it was complicated to take
television from Logie Baird's attic

602
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:39,519
to the point where you're now
appearing on a television
in Syria, but they did it.

603
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,000
In a very short time. They did.

604
00:37:41,001 --> 00:37:46,759
Anyway, it is now time to put
a star in our reasonably priced car.

605
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:50,359
My guest tonight is responsible for
bands such as Boyzone,

606
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:52,479
Westlife, and Jedward.

607
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:57,759
And yet surprisingly, he hasn't been
tried for crimes against humanity.

608
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:01,400
Ladies and gentlemen, it's the other
one from the X Factor, Louis Walsh.

609
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:08,839
Have a seat.

610
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,439
Have a seat.

611
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:13,320
Louis Walsh, he's come among us.

612
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:20,439
And, um, now, to be fair,

613
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:23,959
I happen to know you do have
very good musical taste.

614
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:26,799
Of course I do, yeah.
I mean, it doesn't LOOK like you do.

615
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:30,319
In my job, in my day job?
Yeah. That's what I sell.

616
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,799
I'm in the music business.
So, you sell?

617
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:35,559
What I listen to at home
is totally different.

618
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:37,559
I happen to know that you
and I share a...

619
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:41,719
What, one person, yeah. Bob Segar.
And the Silver Bullet Band.
Silver Bullet Band.

620
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:45,959
Who here is familiar with Bob Segar
and the Silver Bullet Band? Yes.

621
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:50,159
Yes? A big fan?
That's one big fan and I think
that's enough of a reason

622
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,759
to discuss Bob Segar at some length.

623
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:56,199
What is your favourite
Bob Segar song?

624
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:59,119
Ooh. Night Moves, I think.

625
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:02,359
I agree. What would you go with,
Night Moves, best one?

626
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:04,919
No, Old Time Rock And Roll.
Old Time Rock And Roll.

627
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:08,079
Old Time is good, yeah. As used
in Risky Business? Absolutely.

628
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:10,519
Starring Tom Cruise.
I've a Wurlitzer jukebox,

629
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:13,239
all the old 45s.
I'm a fan of music.

630
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:17,199
So are you just flogging the noises
that come out of...? I sell.

631
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,879
You sell Jedward?
Yeah, they do incredibly well.

632
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:25,759
Do you listen to Jedward at home?
No. Honestly, no, no, I don't.

633
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,639
Does anybody own a Jedward record?

634
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:32,399
They've a new album out next week.
Have they? Yeah. I'm not interested.
Doing really well around Europe.

635
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:35,879
Still not interested. Your kids
would like them. No, they wouldn't.

636
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:39,719
They would! Kids love Jedward.
They'd get savagely beaten!

637
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:42,399
Kids like Jedward and Westlife
and Take That.

638
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:46,119
Having established that you are
a man of great musical taste.

639
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:48,719
At home. At home, yes. At home.

640
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:53,199
Is it Cowell, then, that's
got the Celine Dion fixation?

641
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:56,319
Has Simon Cowell got
a rubbish musical taste?

642
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,639
Yes.

643
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:02,159
Absolutely. He gave us Robson
and Jerome. He did, actually.

644
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,959
And he gave us Zig and Zag.

645
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:07,839
Has he, do you think, in his house
got any Led Zeppelin at all?

646
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:10,879
No. Absolutely not.
I have Led Zeppelin albums at home.

647
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,399
Bad Company?

648
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:15,359
Bad Company, Can't Get Enough?
He wouldn't know who they were.

649
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:19,039
He has a lot of bad company
but it is not the band.

650
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:22,919
So, anyway, X Factor, when is that
back? What stage are we at now?

651
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:26,119
That's series eight, it's back,
we've got three new judges.

652
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:28,559
We've got Gary Barlow,
Kelly Rowland, who was in

653
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:31,919
Destiny's Child, and we've got
Tulisa from the N-Dubz.

654
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:35,399
I know Gary Barlow. Yeah.
You'd know Destiny's Child.

655
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:38,359
It's three girls, Beyonce was
like the front lady in the band.

656
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:42,479
Boncey what? Beyonce. Beyonce!
She's like a big, big star.

657
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:47,679
Boncey and who?
She's married to Jay-Z. What?

658
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,639
Jay-Z. He's very cool.

659
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:52,679
Literally no idea what you're
talking about now. So, anyway,

660
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:55,759
the important thing to establish
is when is the X Factor back?

661
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:59,439
Back on TV August, ITV.
Until September?

662
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,639
December 12th.

663
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:04,279
I have to ask you this
because we have to go out

664
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:06,478
on Top Gear on a Sunday night
when you're not on.

665
00:41:06,479 --> 00:41:07,760
And my children say,

666
00:41:07,761 --> 00:41:10,919
when we are sitting on a beach
freezing ourselves to death

667
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:13,279
in December,
"Daddy, why are we here now?"

668
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:16,519
"Because Louis and Simon..."
Simon's not on this year.

669
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:20,279
Oh, he's gone.
"Because Louis and Boncey's mate..."

670
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:24,639
Beyonce. "..are watching a girl
who last week was working
behind a till in Asda

671
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,240
"and she's on a journey."

672
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,599
Everyone's on a journey.

673
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:34,399
We have to move Top Gear to get out
the way of the ratings juggernaut.

674
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:37,999
Because people wouldn't watch
Top Gear. They'd prefer X Factor.

675
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,799
We know, which is really annoying!
But anyway... Anyway!

676
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,919
..while we're on the subject
of the X Factor.

677
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:47,839
Is it true that Simon Cowell
bought you all Botox vouchers?

678
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,679
He actually did, last Christmas.

679
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:53,079
You know what, you know something?
I haven't used mine. No!

680
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:58,159
I'd like to... Jeremy, Jeremy...

681
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:01,759
I'd like to offer it to you.
Seriously. I won't use them.

682
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:04,319
Is that where you get injected,
or is that collagen?

683
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:06,679
What do you do with Botox?
It's your face.

684
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:09,479
What do you do with it?
Ask Simon next time he's on.

685
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:12,759
Does he do Botox? Hello!

686
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:15,200
Every time he's on he goes,
"You really should..."

687
00:42:15,201 --> 00:42:19,519
"Darling!" "Darling,
take more care of your appearance."

688
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:22,319
I always think, but what could
I do to improve myself?

689
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:25,999
Do you want my Botox vouchers? No!

690
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,399
I want to talk to you about cars.
Because this is a car show.

691
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:34,079
What turns you on about a car?
I like the look of cars.
I just love looking at cars.

692
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:37,839
I love looking at
Lamborghinis, Maseratis, Ferraris.

693
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:40,959
Bentleys, Rolls, I love...
I'm always taking pictures of them.

694
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:43,679
I don't like driving fast
but I love looking at cars.

695
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:47,959
It's the aesthetics of a car?
Absolutely. After... Which was
the first one? Boy's World?

696
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:51,399
I had a Toledo. Boyzone was
my first band. Your first band?

697
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:54,479
My first car was a Toledo.
It was a white Toledo.

698
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:57,999
Yes, and I took it out
the very first time ever.

699
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,119
I was parking it at home and I put
my foot on the accelerator.

700
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:03,599
I went bang into the wall
and wrecked the car.

701
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:05,759
The first time I took it out.
The first time?

702
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:10,079
The first time I'd taken it out.
And were you employed as a
record-company chauffeur?

703
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:15,479
I wasn't employed as a chauffeur,
I was an agent. I used to bring
artists to Ireland, singers,

704
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:20,239
different singers, like Sinitta.
I used to drive them around
to the gigs. In your Toledo?

705
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:23,999
No, I had a Mustang.
I had a really nice Mustang.

706
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,119
Do you remember what period Mustang?

707
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:29,679
It was red and black,
that's all I remember.

708
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:35,799
I'm driving a Maserati now. I've had
it three years. A Gran Turismo. I've
done 3,000 miles in it. 3,000 miles?

709
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:38,119
3,000 miles. In three years?

710
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:44,719
Yeah. Do you like it? I love it!
I love looking at it. I wash it
every week. I love the car.

711
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:47,519
That's the first time we've ever
had a guest who says,

712
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,559
"I love my car,
I watch it every week."

713
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:53,119
I wash it. Wash it.
Oh, wash it! I'm a bit mutton.

714
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:57,239
So you have a penchant for
American cars and good-looking cars.

715
00:43:57,240 --> 00:44:02,079
But you're not really a driver? I'm
not a fast driver. So, the bad news.

716
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:05,799
I know I'm a terrible driver.
I know.

717
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:11,999
How do we know? I know!
I drove around that bloody track.

718
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:16,359
I ended up on the grass.
I know I'm not good. I'm probably
the worst you've ever had.

719
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:19,359
Sadly, when you went on the grass,
the cameras weren't running.

720
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:26,280
Oh, good. Yes, they were! Unusually,
I believe this is the first corner.

721
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:31,719
Yes, look, here you go.
Foot still in it.

722
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:36,159
That's the dictionary definition
of understeer. Still in it!

723
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:39,679
I love the way that you had
the hope that it was going to be

724
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:43,079
OK as a lap time. "Still keep
going!" Have many people done that?

725
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:48,119
The only person who ever went off
there was Lionel Richie.

726
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:52,519
Lionel? The wheel fell off.
That was the only reason. OK, OK.

727
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:59,280
Who would like to see the actual
lap? YEAH! Let's have a look.
Here we go.

728
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:02,080
Racy start.

729
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:04,639
No wheel spin. Why not?

730
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:09,239
There's a terrible smell of oil.
The handbrake is on.

731
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:11,720
It was on, yes!
You set off with the handbrake on?

732
00:45:11,721 --> 00:45:15,639
OK, let's have a look at turn one.
Have we got it right this time?

733
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:20,999
Yes, no, yes. Just held it all
together there.

734
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:25,199
Ooh, changed gear.
I need Stig, badly.

735
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:27,719
I need Stig, yes. He was good.

736
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:30,199
You're going a very long way
round.

737
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:31,279
Argh!

738
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:32,319
Oh...

739
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:34,599
I'm going to be the last
person ever.

740
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:38,079
You really do need to get those
gear-changes worked out.

741
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:40,680
It's going, ra-ra-ra!
I drive an automatic car.

742
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:44,039
Change gear!

743
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:47,680
Change gear. What are gears?
There we go, that's it.

744
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:51,760
OK, here we go. I'm finally
going to fly this one.

745
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:56,559
Scary doing that. Here we go.

746
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:58,360
I hope I'm insured.

747
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:04,359
No, you don't needs to be insured.
Nothing to hit.

748
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:08,599
Second to last corner. That's rather
a neat line through there,
if I may say.

749
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:13,519
And Gambon.
That's also very nicely done.

750
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:15,159
Across the line, everybody.

751
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:22,880
So...

752
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:26,599
There it is, where do you think?

753
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:28,319
I'm near the bottom.

754
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:31,959
These are wet times. Ignore the
wet times. Anything with W after it.

755
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:35,679
The slowest we've ever had was
Amber Heard, and she did a 1.50.3.

756
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:39,239
You think you were slower than that?
Am I under Angelina Jolie?

757
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:42,680
I don't know!

758
00:46:42,681 --> 00:46:46,400
Right, 1:53 is the slowest so far.
You did it in 1...

759
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,999
40... Oh, really?

760
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,959
7.7. That's not bad.

761
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:56,920
That's good!

762
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:03,919
Sitting there between Alastair
Campbell and Danny Boyle.

763
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:06,559
Wow. A weird place to find yourself.

764
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:09,679
So I did better than Geldof?
You what?

765
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:14,159
I did better than Bob Geldof.
Oh yes, you beat Gob Beldof.
I'm happy.

766
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:16,719
And Al Murray. So there we are.
There we are.

767
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:20,159
The audience loves you,
the Stig loves you,
we all love you.

768
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:24,199
Ladies and gentlemen, Louis Walsh!

769
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:25,560
Louis Walsh!

770
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:39,839
Now, we recently received
an invitation to a motorsport event.

771
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:44,319
And as it involved mud and
4x4s and it was in Wales,

772
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:46,399
who better to attend, we thought,

773
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:50,880
than Top Gear's own Minister for
Rural Affairs, Richard Hammond?

774
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:57,719
'This is cross-country racing.'

775
00:47:57,720 --> 00:48:00,559
'It takes place at various locations
across Britain

776
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:03,199
'and for the teams taking part,

777
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:06,200
'it's one of the toughest amateur
motor sports around.'

778
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:15,879
We're here to follow one of those
teams as they take part in their
very first event.

779
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:19,399
But here's the thing,
there's something about these guys

780
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:22,920
that takes that challenge
to a whole new level.

781
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:33,279
'This team is made up of soldiers
who've all suffered massive injuries
whilst fighting in Afghanistan.'

782
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:36,160
'Soldiers like Tom, the co-driver.'

783
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:38,839
I was a sniper out there.

784
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:43,039
I shifted a sandbag and detonated
a booby-trap IED.

785
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:46,319
I just lost my feet to begin with
and through infection,

786
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:50,319
and other various things, I kept
having to have aggressive surgery

787
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:54,719
and ended up basically losing my
left arm and having my legs
amputated.

788
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:58,319
'Then there's Gav,
the team's mechanic.'

789
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:00,999
I was unlucky enough to strike
an IED,

790
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:05,399
obviously maiming me, leaving
me a bilateral amputee.

791
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:08,999
I lost both my femoral arteries.

792
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,720
I've got no idea how I survived
that, to be fair.

793
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:18,800
'Compared to those two, Tony the
driver actually feels quite lucky.'

794
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:22,400
I'm a below-knee scratch.
Is that what you call it!?

795
00:49:22,401 --> 00:49:26,879
Having been mercilessly ripped by
Tom and others for being,

796
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:31,119
well, it's just a flesh wound,
really - to quote Monty Python.

797
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:34,559
'These soldiers are using motor sport
as a way of helping them

798
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:36,679
'come to terms with their injuries.'

799
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:41,039
'They've set themselves an incredible
challenge, because in just 18 months,

800
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:45,880
'they aim to compete in the world's
most gruelling race...'

801
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:50,920
'The fearsome Dakar rally.'

802
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:57,199
I know there's amputees
all round the world

803
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:59,999
but for us, it's like pushing it
as far as we can.

804
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,879
If you can crack on in a Dakar rally
when you're doing 18-hour days

805
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:07,280
for two weeks solid, you can
pretty much achieve anything.

806
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:12,119
Your career's going one direction
and all of a sudden it grinds
to a halt

807
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:16,639
and you have to think about a
totally different way of living
your life.

808
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:20,680
It's important to challenge
yourself, to keep on challenging
yourself.

809
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:26,119
'Out on the eight-mile course,
most of the other competitors

810
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:28,680
'are running in powerful,
bespoke 4x4s.'

811
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:33,719
'But the soldiers must begin
their long climb to the Dakar

812
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:37,039
'in a humble Land Rover Freelander.'

813
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:39,720
First disabled team to do this,
mate.

814
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:44,200
Amber. 3, 2, 1, go.

815
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:49,320
Straight down here, mate.

816
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:53,439
Brake, brake, brake, brake.

817
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:54,560
Good, good.

818
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:59,119
What would you like to see come out
of this weekend?

819
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:02,399
I'd like to see it function,
for a start.

820
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:05,719
To find out where our weaknesses
are and work on them,

821
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:07,880
just keep focusing
on our weaknesses.

822
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:14,759
That's it.
'Tony and Tom complete their first
run in 12 minutes 14,

823
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:17,680
'some four minutes shy
of the big boys.'

824
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:22,479
'Already, they've discovered
a problem that is unique to them.'

825
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:25,159
The problem we've got is obviously

826
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:29,399
because Tony's missing his left leg,
he can't feel the palm of his foot

827
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:33,039
on the clutch and that's going to
give slip and you'll lose power.

828
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:36,239
I think what we're going to do
is devise a light that comes on

829
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:40,919
and warns him he's riding the
clutch, so he can pull his leg off.
Neat idea.

830
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:44,999
'The clutch fix isn't one
that can be done on site.

831
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:48,280
'So, for now,
the team must crack on regardless.'

832
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:53,359
'And crack on, they do.'

833
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:55,680
You did 10.54 on that last one.

834
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:59,840
Hairpin. First gear, mate.

835
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:02,200
10.41 on that one.

836
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:07,879
Go through, go through, go through.

837
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:11,039
'Spending a day with them,

838
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:14,959
'it becomes obvious their injuries
are more than just physical.'

839
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:18,239
The bloke alongside you, killed?

840
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:19,759
Yes, Anthony Lombardi.

841
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:22,999
He was also a mechanic.
Young lad, 21 year old.

842
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,719
He was a really good bloke, yes...

843
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:27,359
It just, I think,

844
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:31,160
it's difficult because... Um...

845
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:36,800
Can you just give us a minute?
Please. As long as you want, mate.

846
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:42,960
Oh, mate...

847
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:51,519
'It's then that you start to realise
the value of a project like this.'

848
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:54,279
These guys are soldiers,
they're men of action.

849
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:57,159
They're used to having challenges,
problems,

850
00:52:57,160 --> 00:53:00,199
obstacles to overcome by working
together as a team.

851
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:05,639
This isn't a treat. This is therapy,
it's something they need to do

852
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:09,160
if they're going to recover as well
as they possibly can.

853
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:16,880
'By the end of the first day,
the amputee team are running second
in the Freelander class.'

854
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:21,400
Hey, mate!
'But there's little time
for celebration...

855
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:30,120
'because they must very quickly get
to grips with the car they'll be
driving in the Dakar,

856
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:35,440
'a four-litre, V8 engine Wildcat.'

857
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:41,559
To make the move to this,

858
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:45,359
the guys are going to need some
training from an expert driver.

859
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:47,840
And we've got one.

860
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:54,079
'Yes, it's ex-Stig,
special forces driving instructor

861
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:56,680
'and romantic novelist, Ben Collins.'

862
00:53:57,640 --> 00:54:02,319
All right? Are we ready? Yes,
very good, looking forward to it.
Good, good.

863
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:06,799
When you're going round, don't tell
him anything, he'll put it in
a book. Make sure of that.

864
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:09,959
All right, men?
All right? Aye!

865
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:13,879
If you see Ryan, stop talking.
Leave it at that, all right?

866
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:16,000
Have fun.
Happy days. OK, let's crank it.

867
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:23,719
Do you know, to be honest, I am quite
glad to see the old splitter back.

868
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:27,560
And I do know how much giving these
guys a hand means to him.

869
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:31,360
So, this is all right.

870
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:39,760
'Clearly, Jilly Cooper had lost
none of his teaching skills.'

871
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:45,679
Pop it back into second.
You don't want to use the brakes,
just pop in the gas.

872
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:51,080
Go. 'Which meant on their first
solo outing, Tony and Tom
didn't disappoint.'

873
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:55,719
Just remember this bit here,
Tone. Nice.

874
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:59,199
That's a nine minute 51 guys.
We'll do it faster next time.
Yes.

875
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:01,919
'But mastering the Wildcat
is just the beginning,

876
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:06,679
'because these guys face problems
that their rivals won't encounter.'

877
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:11,159
There you go, mate.
'Gavin, for example, has had
to devise a unique system

879
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:19,319
'Tiredness is an issue too.
As a triple amputee,

880
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:25,240
'Tom uses 300% more energy
than an able-bodied person,
just to move around.'

881
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:28,759
'And then, there's their prosthetics.

882
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:31,479
If I show you the back of mine,

883
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:33,999
it makes more sense.
See the back of here?

884
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:38,239
That is quite unnerving when you do
that. You just wanted to do that.

885
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:41,439
Sand's getting
into the piston there,

886
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:44,799
getting water into the
electronics, it's all electronic

887
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:47,759
but if the legs play up
and that, I can just...

888
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:50,519
pop them in the back
and just crack on.

889
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:55,439
'One thing that won't let
them down is their camaraderie,

890
00:55:55,440 --> 00:56:00,479
'which shows up best when they
talk about the kind of tricks they'd
play on each other in hospital.'

891
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:04,519
One of the big ones was swapping
their wheelchair by the bedside
while they slept,

892
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:06,919
with maybe an office chair
with castor wheels,

893
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:10,599
and then pushing them around
and that for the rest of the day.

894
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:14,399
Or padlocking them to their beds.
So they set off and...?!

895
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:18,439
I got injured about a week
after a guy, a ranger, Andy Allen.

896
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:22,119
Basically he lost his eyesight
and both his legs as well.

897
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:24,519
He was a big Manchester United fan,
huge.

898
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:27,079
The guy obviously had
Manchester United shirts

899
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:29,679
and we swapped them all
for Liverpool shirts

900
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:34,479
and the guy would be cutting
round in Liverpool shirts. That is
a properly devious idea!

901
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:38,079
But when he started to get his
eyesight back a little bit,

902
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:41,079
he basically just
let loose on us then.

903
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:45,199
It feeds the sense of humour
that you're used to
and takes it a step further.

904
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:48,159
It also makes you come to terms
with what's happened to you.

905
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:51,599
You don't have to stop being you
just because of what's happened.

906
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:54,200
You don't have to...
People shouldn't pity you.

907
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:58,959
Come on.

908
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:04,160
'Throughout the day, the lads have
been getting faster and faster.'

909
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:10,079
You've just done two runs.
That was a 9.17 and a 9.08.

910
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:13,440
Break that barrier! Eight second.

911
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:18,479
'And as they lined up for the last
run of the weekend,

912
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:21,839
'everybody - us, the organisers,
the other competitors,

913
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:25,280
'wanted to see them break
the nine-minute barrier.'

914
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:31,719
Mate, if we don't do it
less than nine minutes...

915
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:33,519
Right, amber.

916
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:36,360
3, 2, 1, go.

917
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:42,720
Keep accelerating this bit, mate.
Keep going, keep going.

918
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:51,320
Second, yes?
Second gear's good.

919
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,240
Boot it, boot it, boot it.

920
00:57:58,360 --> 00:57:59,600
Nice!

921
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:01,840
This is awesome!

922
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:11,400
Keep going, keep going.

923
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:17,479
Here he is, here he is!
Oh my God.

924
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:18,920
That's it!

925
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:23,279
'Sadly, they hadn't broken
that nine-minute barrier,

926
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:26,559
'probably because they HAD broken
something else.'

927
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:28,359
Oh, yes!

928
00:58:28,360 --> 00:58:30,359
Most of that will polish out.

929
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:32,759
Largely, yes, largely.

930
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:36,120
That's a below centre point scratch.

931
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:40,519
'I really hope that these guys
do make it to the Dakar,

932
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:44,280
'because on spirit alone,
they deserve to be there.'

933
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:50,959
On that day I got blown up,
I never thought I'd make this stage
where I'm at now.

934
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:54,439
We said this in the car before,
who'd ever have thought

935
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:57,199
we'd be sat in a Wildcat on a
Sunday morning, rallying around?

936
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:59,920
What an experience.

937
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:11,040
You DO deserve to be in the
Wildcat on a Sunday morning.

938
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:15,400
And they are
here with us tonight!

939
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:21,920
Now, can I just say, really,

940
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:26,879
I think everybody here will join us
in wishing you all the very best.

941
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:30,799
We really do hope you make it
to the start and the finish
of the Dakar.

942
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:34,720
You really do deserve it, guys.
You do deserve it.

943
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:40,639
That's it!

944
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:44,119
Not only for this programme,
but for this series.

945
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:46,599
We'll be back whenever
the X Factor's finished.

946
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:48,240
See you then, good night.

947
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:07,640
