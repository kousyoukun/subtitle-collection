1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,480
Amazingly I'm pregnant.

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:04,100
- Judith's pregnant.
- Is it yours?

3
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:05,670
Yes! She's not slept
with anyone else.

4
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:07,230
Robbie's got this new girlfriend.

5
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:09,390
Hellooo! I'm Cheryl, how do you do?

6
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,230
She's moving in with him,
apparently. Right.

7
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:13,990
Can I go and live with my dad?
I don't think that's a good idea.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,470
Have you not got a date sorted yet?
It's her sister.

9
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,750
She can't decide if she wants her
at t'wedding or not.

10
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,110
Alan Buttershaw!

11
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,750
He's gone and invited Ted.
His brother.

12
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:25,390
Mum. Dad went out.
Can you come and get me?

13
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,830
I've offered to organise the wedding
for them. And I said you'd help me.

14
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:30,670
Lawrence! Where is Lawrence?

15
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:32,590
Don't tell me something
you'll regret.

16
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,800
I murdered him - Eddy.

17
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,160
Caroline?

18
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,760
Caroline.

19
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,640
Caroline. Caroline.

20
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,680
I made you some tea. Caroline.

21
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,440
What time is it? Ten to seven.

22
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,000
Caroline...

23
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,160
Are you all right?

24
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,400
I told you things.

25
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,560
Are you angry?

26
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,160
Do you hate me?

27
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,520
Speak to me.

28
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,920
I need to know...

29
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,240
..if you're going
to go to the police.

30
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,560
Why did you tell me?

31
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,320
I don't know.

32
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,800
You told me what he did to you.

33
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,200
The other "humiliations".

34
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,120
Nobody should have to
live like that.

35
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,360
And you never...
ever told anyone else?

36
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,960
Ever?

37
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,640
Me dad...knows I...

38
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:02,670
..smacked him round the head
to finish him off.

39
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,320
But he thought he'd been trying
to commit suicide.

40
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,870
Because that's what I told him,
so...

41
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:11,470
He didn't know the things
he did to me.

42
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,680
My dad didn't.

43
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,200
I think he...

44
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,840
..knew I wasn't having much fun.

45
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,600
But....

46
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,120
..I never told anyone that before.

47
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,880
I... I couldn't.

48
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,920
If I hadn't done it to him,
Caroline...

49
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,120
..he'd have done it to me.

50
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,310
I think perhaps we should
never mention it again.

51
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:50,120
I think perhaps we should pretend
you never told me.

52
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,800
Right.

53
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,590
Did you sleep well? I didn't.

54
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,150
I couldn't, not with all this
buzzing about in my head.

55
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,670
Could you eat a kipper, Alan?

56
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:12,960
No! I think I'm sufficiently
sophonsified. Thank you.

57
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:19,750
Had you thought about...
Well, not a hen-party, Celia -

58
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,680
I know that's not very you -
but something the evening before?

59
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,870
Like?

60
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,910
Well, you can't spend the evening
together, can you, beforehand?

61
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:31,110
Can't we? Why not?
We did first time we got wed.

62
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,670
Well, it's not what you do.

63
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:36,430
Well...me and Alan don't always
play by the rules, do we, Alan?

64
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:39,030
Not if we can help it.
We like to think laterally.

65
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,510
Outside t'box.
We're forever pushing the envelope.

66
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,630
So you'll be stopping in, then?
Together? Do you fancy a stag night,
Alan?

67
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:48,150
Like in a lap-dancing club,
with strippers and so on? Yeah.

68
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,470
Do YOU? I could do. With the girls.

69
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:54,110
That what you had in mind,
Muriel? It's not... No, I said...

70
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,990
Do they do lap-dancing with fellas?
Probably.

71
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,350
Is that the same as polo dancing?
No, it isn't.

72
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,400
Do you mean pole dancing?
Ooh! How do you know?

73
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,080
No, that's not what I had in mind.

74
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,400
I don't think you'd...
'Ey, Google it.

75
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:16,630
A sleazy night in Amsterdam!
What more could a woman ask for?

76
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:20,600
I did start off the conversation
by saying... Making assumptions.

77
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,550
I don't mind going to Amsterdam for
the art galleries if that's more...

78
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:29,710
Oh! Bugger the art galleries!
They'll be full of them daubs

79
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:32,590
by that twerp who
chopped his ear off.

80
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:36,670
This is my hen night we're talking
about. What you thinking, Alan?

81
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:39,710
Personally, well,
I've been there, fallen over,

82
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,190
got t'T-shirt, but if YOU fancy it...

83
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,270
Amsterdam? Have you?

84
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:47,520
Yeah. More than once.
So you'd recommend it? Oh!

85
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,800
I wonder why you told me.

86
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,800
Did you think you'd feel better?

87
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,350
I don't know.

88
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,760
Do you?

89
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,400
Do you wish I hadn't told you?

90
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,720
I suppose you told me
because you needed to.

91
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:18,960
You needed to tell someone.
I'm just wondering why it was me.

92
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,360
Because...

93
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,120
..you were here.

94
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,670
Because I was drunk.

95
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,560
(Do you want me to turn you in?)

96
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,710
Is that why you told me? No.

97
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,520
No.

98
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,640
I've buggered everything up,
haven't I?

99
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:47,560
We could've been friends, and I...
You had a lot to deal with.

100
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,760
You were trapped in a marriage
with a man who...

101
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,520
We are friends.

102
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,320
You told me because you needed to.

103
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,160
I'm not going to turn you in.

104
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,280
I'm not going to turn you in,
all right?

105
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,320
Are you sure?

106
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,120
Yeah.

107
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,600
Really?

108
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,160
(Yeah.)

109
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,830
Drive carefully! Yep, we will!

110
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:32,790
Like she cares.
Do you fancy a stag night?

111
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,550
Text me to let me know
you've got back safely!

112
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,670
Right-o! Like hell...

113
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,950
Well, I wouldn't mind going for
a pint up Spring Rock with Harry

114
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:44,550
and 'appen our Raff.
I could do a bit of something.

115
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,830
Me and Caroline and Gillian.

116
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:50,790
And I could even invite HER -
Muriel.

117
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,400
A laugh an hour(!)

118
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,990
Ta-ta!

119
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,310
Bye!

120
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:59,430
Have you been to Amsterdam?
Were you lying?

121
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,120
No, have you?

122
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,800
Are you sure you're fit to drive?

123
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,680
Not entirely.

124
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,710
What about you?

125
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,840
God knows.

126
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,280
Better get my telephone.

127
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:36,400
I'm sorry. It was difficult, I...
Piss off.

128
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,910
Thanks for ringing.

129
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:45,110
Where did you find him?
I didn't. He rang me. He was upset.

130
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,310
I asked him to ring you,
to leave a message at least,

131
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,830
to say he was spending the night
at my house, but he wouldn't.

132
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:54,560
And he wouldn't give me your number,
and I couldn't get hold of Caroline.
Neither could he. That's why...

133
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,880
Anyway...

134
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:00,520
I had to go out. Sure.
It was difficult.

135
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,160
So, Caroline...

136
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,790
..doesn't know...anything?

137
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:11,470
Well, I think she will when
she finally picks up her messages.

138
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,510
He left several, I left one.

139
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:16,760
PHONE RINGS

140
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:22,310
Hello? 'Where's Lawrence?!'
He's fine, he's fine.

141
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,190
He's absolutely fine, he's here.

142
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,550
He's playing on the Xbox.
'Well, what happened?'

143
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,830
Nothing happened, it was just
a silly misunderstanding.

144
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,840
A storm in a teacup, that's all.

145
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,960
No problem, any time.

146
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:47,310
You're an idiot.
I have one single evening to myself
and I can't even trust you for that!

147
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,230
He's absolutely fine. 'God Almighty!'

148
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:53,350
Why weren't you answering YOUR phone?
Because I lost it! Don't blame me!

149
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,750
'I want to speak to him.'
He's playing on the Xbox.

150
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,630
Well, where did he sleep?

151
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,190
What happened?

152
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,990
At Kate's, he slept at Kate's house.
Kate's?!

153
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,870
He...apparently...rang William

154
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:08,150
cos he couldn't get hold of anyone,
and William suggested ringing her.

155
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,110
He had her number on his phone.

156
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,950
Er, William did.

157
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:14,350
She's just dropped him off, just now.

158
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:18,550
Right. Well, I'll be back
in an hour. Less.

159
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,680
Is Kate still there? No.

160
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,550
Drive carefully.

161
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,510
Jerk.

162
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,520
Are you all right? Yup.

163
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,590
I'm going to go.

164
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,950
OK.

165
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,910
Look after yourself. And you.

166
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,480
Sorry, but...

167
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,000
..can I just say...

168
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,870
..I think you're right
about you and Robbie.

169
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:46,440
I know. I really like him.

170
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,120
No, I meant...

171
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:53,550
You said it could never be
a good idea, you and him.
Don't you remember?

172
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:56,760
Last night? It was how the
conversation - how it all started,
why you told me.

173
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,030
Right, OK, yeah.

174
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:03,470
Move on. You're a nice person,
you're a good mother, you work hard.

175
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:06,360
Something appalling happened,
you dealt with it, but move on.

176
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,910
Yeah.

177
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:11,510
Promise me? If I'm keeping
this secret, promise me,

178
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:15,190
because that would be one hell
of a can of worms, you and him.
Surely you can see that.

179
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,080
Yeah, course. Sorry, you're right.

180
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,790
I thought I'd make some lunch
for him.

181
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,840
And you if you want some.

182
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,510
Are you all right?

183
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,830
He all right?

184
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,670
He's absolutely fine.

185
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,710
It's just soup and bread and cheese.

186
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,000
Shouldn't you be looking
after Judith?

187
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,510
She won't get rid of it.

188
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:19,030
And I don't want to encourage her
by pretending that I think

189
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,270
it's a good idea.

190
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,910
I mean, what kind of life
would it have?

191
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,990
You'll be divorced soon,
you could marry her.

192
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,600
Mm, well,
that won't be happening.

193
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,710
It's sad...

194
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,590
to think of all the things
we got wrong.

195
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,080
We often used to get a lot
right as well.

196
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,510
I came to say thank you.

197
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,990
You didn't have to do that.

198
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,350
I left my phone in a hotel.

199
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:56,590
Gillian and I, we're organising
the wedding, my mum's wedding,

200
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:59,470
so that's why I didn't answer it.

201
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,030
Is Lawrence all right?

202
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,350
Yeah, he's fine.

203
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:07,870
I've left him so I'd...better
get back.

204
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,080
OK.

205
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,390
Can I come in?

206
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,360
I CAN say it on the doorstep.

207
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,870
All right...

208
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,240
No, come in.

209
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,960
Have you...

210
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,510
..got a birthing partner?

211
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:35,230
My mum said she would.

212
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,960
If I needed someone.

213
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:43,190
What about Greg, what about him?

214
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,710
No.

215
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,600
He really never was
part of the equation beyond...

216
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,550
Anyone else?
No.

217
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,760
Sorry.

218
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,520
SHE SIGHS

219
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:02,920
I just had a really weird night
with Gillian. She told me...

220
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,310
She told me what her husband
used to do to her.

221
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,800
He committed suicide,
but before that.

222
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,590
She never told anyone before,

223
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,910
she's never been able to
talk about it before, but...

224
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,910
she told me things.

225
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,590
He raped her, he did things.
Things you couldn't...

226
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,790
Humiliating things.

227
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,400
Jesus.

228
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,230
And this is a big bloke.

229
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:32,600
Not that it'd take a big bloke,
she's tiny, Gillian.

230
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,030
He pinned her down,
and she couldn't do anything

231
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,270
so she just took it,
because she had to.

232
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,680
Why? I mean, why did he...?

233
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,470
It's control.

234
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,950
It's power.

235
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,760
Why do they ever?

236
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:56,360
He was a bully, he was a prick.
He was just an inadequate prick.

237
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:02,310
I think she told me because
we drank too much and

238
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,990
we were telling each other things,
and the point is,

239
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,390
apart from the fact that
it was a really weird evening,

240
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,840
the point is I realised that...

241
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:17,430
..amidst all the disappointment
and complexity

242
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:22,790
and mundanity and madness
of the day-to-day,

243
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,560
we had something really nice
that happened between us.

244
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,630
I know you've made up
your mind about me

245
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,190
and I know I leave a lot to be
desired sometimes

246
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,960
but I decided it was worth...

247
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:43,160
..one more time asking...

248
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:47,430
..saying I'm sorry for
all the things I got wrong

249
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,680
and I will try,
I would try harder.

250
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,710
No.

251
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,320
Thank you.

252
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,750
SHEEP BLEAT

253
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:40,470
So, the plan is I drive
our car to Hebden.

254
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,350
No, we both drive our cars to Hebden.

255
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,550
We leave mine - ours - there.

256
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,390
Or his, one or t'other, and

257
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:51,350
drive back to Souby Bridge Wharf
in the other one, whichever.

258
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:57,070
Then set off in t'narrow boat
up through Luddenden and Mytholmroyd

259
00:16:57,080 --> 00:17:01,110
to Hebden, spend the night
in Hebden, go for a nice meal...

260
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,190
Piss-up.

261
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,750
Meal. Meal.

262
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:07,230
We'd have all our stuff on board
ready, morning suits,

263
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:11,550
top hats, the ring, then
drive straight to t'hotel

264
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:14,150
from Hebden in our car.

265
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,070
Or whichever car
we've left in Hebden,

266
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:20,430
and be at the hotel bang on 10:00am.

267
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,630
So, that works.

268
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,150
You're not seriously going to spend
a night in that...crate?

269
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:30,150
Hey, Celia. You won't recognise it
in a few short weeks.

270
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,070
We're talking total refurbishment.
Inside and out.

271
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:36,510
My imagination's not quite
as fertile as yours.

272
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:40,510
Well, you'll have a nice evening
with your Caroline and our Gillian

273
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,390
and your Muriel, won't you?

274
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,320
Yeah! We're going paintballing.

275
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,110
Seriously?
Are you?

276
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,240
Can we come?

277
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:54,390
My only regret marrying Alan now

278
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:59,590
is that we didn't get that
bungalow up Ripponden Bank.

279
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,110
There'll be others.

280
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:05,320
Do you think John would
give me away?

281
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,950
John?

282
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:10,950
Well, who else can I ask?

283
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,470
Do you need giving away?

284
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,270
Well, it's traditional.

285
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:17,910
Mum, you don't like John.
You've never liked him.

286
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:21,510
I'm surprised you're even
thinking about inviting him.

287
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,310
You'll be inviting Judith next.

288
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,190
I bloody won't.

289
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,430
Well, Harry's doing a speech
about Alan,

290
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,110
and traditionally, before that,

291
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:33,270
the father of the bride
does one about the bride,

292
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,870
and, you see, for all his
being a waste of space,

293
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:39,070
I thought that might be something
John'd be quite good at,

294
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,670
making a speech.

295
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,590
Wouldn't you be worried
he might say things

296
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,510
you'd rather people didn't hear?

297
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,830
Like what?

298
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,350
Well, there was that time you
slapped him across the face

299
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,670
over at the farm.
Oh, yeah.

300
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:53,270
I shan't tell them about that time
you fell down that man-hole

301
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,030
in the snow when
you'd been on the razzle.

302
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,350
It should've been better lit.

303
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:58,550
Then that time you nearly
choked to death laughing

304
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,750
when he snapped all the tendons
in his ankle

305
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:03,070
falling off that jetty in
Porta Pollenca.

306
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:05,630
That was comical.

307
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:08,470
Or that time you drove t'wrong way
round Bull Green roundabout

308
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,670
in Halifax when you came
back from t'Continent.

309
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,030
That were quite exciting!

310
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:14,550
And then that Christmas
when you let all his tyres down,

311
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,870
when you both got drunk
together on barley wine

312
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,430
and he called you a rancid old bag.

313
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,750
Oh, I don't think
he ever knew that was me.

314
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,190
CAROLINE LAUGHS

315
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,670
Oh! He did.

316
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:27,230
Or that time you got caught
shagging that sheep.

317
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,110
Hey.
It's not funny.

318
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:32,150
Our Gillian once caught a lad...

319
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,550
I know, she told me.

320
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:37,880
Funny thing was he kept coming back
to see the same sheep.

321
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:43,230
Well, there was that fella in India
married his dog.

322
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:47,110
Which, to be fair,
I can see the advantages.

323
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,430
Eh? You wouldn't have a dog going,
"Where you going?",

324
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,070
"You're not going dressed
like that,"

325
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:53,230
"Don't you dare bring any of your
mates home again,

326
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,830
"not in that state."

327
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:58,680
Oh, bugger off, go live somewhere
else if you don't like it.

328
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:03,800
You must miss her though, Edith.

329
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:09,750
Are you sure you want to get wed
again? No, I'm just thinking.

330
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:13,590
It's probably part of my duties
as your best man to make you stop

331
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:17,430
and think is this what you want?

332
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,190
What you really, really want?

333
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,390
You're going to get sacked
if you carry on like that.

334
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,630
I'd have made a good Spice Girl, me.

335
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,990
Manly Spice.

336
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,470
Old Spice.

337
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,550
You're just jealous. Yeah,
you keep telling yourself that.

338
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:32,510
Hey, what about your speech?

339
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,790
DOOR CLOSES

340
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,110
Dad?

341
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,480
Hello, love.

342
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,310
Have you remembered
what day it is tomorrow?

343
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:44,150
Is it Sunday?

344
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:47,190
Yeah, it's...Mum's birthday.

345
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,390
Aye! So it is. Yes.

346
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,990
Yes. Yes, I did know that.

347
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,990
I thought we might take Calamity
up to see her.

348
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,360
Yes. Yes, we should,
she'd like that.

349
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,670
Shame that bungalow fell through.

350
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,030
What bungalow?

351
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,470
That one up Ripponden Bank.

352
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,630
That one you and Celia
put the offer in on.

353
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,110
I thought you weren't right keen.

354
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,870
Me?

355
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,440
"Chucking money away on
dozy big bungalows."

356
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,950
I was lashing out.

357
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,590
I didn't mean it.

358
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,790
Not if it was what you wanted.

359
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:28,230
I'm not entirely sure it was.

360
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,750
What do you mean?

361
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,550
It was my fault we didn't get it.

362
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,190
Sorry?

363
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,190
She doesn't know.

364
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,750
What do you mean?

365
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:42,470
Well, when Darren and Kimberley said
they couldn't raise a mortgage,

366
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,470
I didn't have the heart to serve 'em
notice to quit.

367
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:50,030
It looked like adding insult
to injury, so

368
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:53,440
I never actually put
the house on the open market.

369
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:57,790
No, I kept meaning to,
but then them other folk came in

370
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,910
with that other offer
on the bungalow,

371
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,880
and then it was too late.

372
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,510
We'll find somewhere,
eventually.

373
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,670
Well, you won't.

374
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:12,590
Not till you actually do put yours
on the open market.

375
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,870
Darren and Kimberley'll
find somewhere else!

376
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,520
You'd give 'em fair warning.
Yeah, I know, but it's just...

377
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:22,750
If I'd got me finger out
and faced it,

378
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,950
we could've been sitting there now.

379
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,430
She fair had her heart set on it.

380
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:32,600
Trouble is, Dad,
you're just too nice a fella.

381
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:39,200
What about you and Robbie, then?

382
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,600
Not worth talking about.

383
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,350
I'm going to go
and look at Uncle Norman.

384
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,680
All right.

385
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:15,880
Now then, old lass,
I've got summat to tell you.

386
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,310
I'm getting wed again.

387
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:23,240
I hope that's all right.

388
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,400
I hope you don't mind.

389
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,080
I think...

390
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,550
Well, we always said life
was for living, didn't we?

391
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,480
And when you're gone...

392
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,520
I just...

393
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:43,670
I hope...

394
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,430
I know you were very young

395
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,720
when you didn't pass that
letter on to me, Celia's letter.

396
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:52,190
And I'm flattered!

397
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:55,040
I'm flattered that you
thought so much of me.

398
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:01,120
And I don't regret anything.

399
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:05,160
What'd be the point?
I don't, anyway.

400
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,120
I just...

401
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:14,750
I hope you would be pleased for me.

402
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:19,840
I think...I need to know
I have your blessing.

403
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:56,040
Is he tidy?

404
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,600
Yeah.

405
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,160
19.

406
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,190
Mad. Aye.

407
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,710
She was ten, me mother,
when he died.

408
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,710
Course, she couldn't get to go
and see him.

409
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,950
They'd managed to get him home

410
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:15,910
to a military hospital in Leicester,
that's where he died.

411
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:18,520
Me granny went down, his mum,
my mother's mum.

412
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:22,320
Sat by his bedside two days.

413
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:27,390
He'd had his spine shot out.

414
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:30,470
Couldn't feel anything apparently.

415
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,520
So...

416
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:38,080
Anyway, I promised me mum
I'd keep him tidy.

417
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,320
I'll see you by the car.

418
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:56,310
Caroline! Sorry.

419
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:59,430
Kate's driven herself into hospital.

420
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,910
She's bleeding.

421
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:03,030
I didn't know if you'd want me
to tell you or not...

422
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,670
Which hospital? You've got
meetings, and most of them

423
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:09,600
we won't be able to reschedule now
till after Christmas!

424
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:17,160
GENERAL CHATTER

425
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,230
It might be fine.

426
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:37,510
It doesn't always mean
what you think it means.

427
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,470
No, I think...

428
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,590
I think if you're bleeding
that's usually it.

429
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,160
Yes, but not always,
and you're 20...

430
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:48,000
How many weeks?
It'd be very unusual.

431
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:51,070
I've kept thinking...

432
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:54,310
for a few days that there
wasn't as much movement.

433
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,030
Have you rung your mum?

434
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:59,110
I don't want to upset her.
Till we know something definite.

435
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,710
Kate McKenzie?

436
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,640
Would you like to come through?

437
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,910
Do you want me to...

438
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,110
come in with you?

439
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,480
Will you?

440
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,960
There wasn't a lot of blood.

441
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,800
It was just...
Sh.

442
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:43,560
It's fine. It's absolutely fine.

443
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:48,550
That's the head there. Can you see?

444
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,550
There's... That's the heart, beating.

445
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,950
I'll just take a few measurements
while we're here,

446
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:56,750
but it all looks absolutely
lovely in there.

447
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:59,110
It's just one of those things,
it happens.

448
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:03,310
You did right to come in,
but, yeah, you're both fine.

449
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:05,550
Thank you.

450
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,470
Can you see what sex it is?

451
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,670
Well...I can give you a clue.

452
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,670
It doesn't appear to have
any testicles.

453
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,790
Oh, you mean...?

454
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,320
SHE MOUTHS

455
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:21,040
Sorry.
Oh, that's...

456
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,030
No! When did this happen?

457
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,830
Day before yesterday.

458
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:36,110
Well, no,
it must've happened last week,

459
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:38,830
but he Skyped
just t'day before yesterday.

460
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:41,550
And it's all swollen, you see.
All up here.

461
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:43,870
Black and blue
and his knee's in plaster,

462
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:46,870
so there'd be a risk of
deep vein thrombosis

463
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,270
apparently,
so the doctors have just said "no".

464
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:51,990
And he's a big fella,
isn't he, Alan? Yeah.

465
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,550
And he's nearly 80, so you
can't take a risk at that age.

466
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:59,430
Travel insurance people've
been very good though.

467
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,910
He'll get his money back.

468
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:04,150
And he can travel over here
in three or four months' time.

469
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,750
How did he break it?

470
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,670
How disappointing for you.

471
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,990
He fell over.

472
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:13,670
On his drive, in Auckland,
just getting his car out.

473
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,710
What about the rest of the family?

474
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:19,230
Oh, they've all fallen
by the wayside, one way and another.

475
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:22,550
It's getting enough time off work
to make it worth their while.

476
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:24,110
You see, realistically,

477
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:27,390
there's no point in coming
for less than three weeks.

478
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:30,350
Spending all that money
and travelling all that way, and...

479
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:34,870
So, are any of them...?
No, no. Doesn't look like it.

480
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,320
Can Angus come?

481
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,150
What about Kate?

482
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,710
What about Kate?

483
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,950
Well, she did offer to play
The Arrival Of The Queen Of Sheba

484
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,510
for me to walk in to,

485
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:51,270
and they've got a lovely piano,
and I don't know anyone else.

486
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:53,280
Oh, I see.

487
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:56,190
Can you ask her?

488
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,640
Well...

489
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,590
Can you?
I can give you her number.

490
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,750
DOOR CLOSES

491
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:05,440
Ooh! That'll be him!

492
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,120
SHE GASPS

493
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:19,040
I've brought you my washing.

494
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,390
Roxy?

495
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:26,310
She's reading politics, philosophy
and economics. She's from Liverpool.

496
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,710
She's at Balliol.
Does she know you're a poof?

497
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,830
Oh, yes.

498
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:32,350
I've been meaning to break
this to you gently for some time,

499
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:35,350
and I know you'll be disappointed,
but I'm not gay.

500
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,630
Are we going to meet her?

501
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,390
I was hoping I could ask her
to the wedding.

502
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:41,990
Smashing! Course you can!
Does she look like the back end
of a bus? Is she blind?

503
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,630
You're so predictable. Aren't you?

504
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,870
OVEN BEEPS

505
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:48,640
Mum, could you get the plates
for me? Yeah.

506
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:55,030
Did our Raff ring you up?

507
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,830
Well up for it.
What?

508
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:58,710
You sure you want him
in on it as well?

509
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,670
Yes, of course!
And Angus if he's coming.

510
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:03,510
Why's Angus coming?
He's my plus-one. What y'on about?

511
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,910
Right,
you've to keep your mouth shut.

512
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,110
(Can you sing?)

513
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,430
Not with my mouth shut.

514
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:10,430
DOORBELL RINGS
See, who's that?

515
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,830
That'll be your dad,
he'll want to have a look at you.

516
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,150
MOBILE PHONE RINGS

517
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,710
Hello?

518
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,990
Ted! It's Ted.

519
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,870
He's just ringing up to say
good luck on the big day.

520
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,950
Aww! How is he? How's his leg?

521
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,510
Is it Dad?
The weather?

522
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:27,270
Well, it's dark here, it's about
7:10,

523
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:29,630
but it's been quite mild though.

524
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,520
How is it where you are?

525
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:36,230
Much the same. Dark, bloody cold.

526
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,910
I keep hoping it might snow.

527
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:40,630
Snow! Do you get snow there?

528
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,390
Not like it does here.

529
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,710
In Yorkshire.

530
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,830
Celia says, "How's your leg?"

531
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,310
Oh, my God.

532
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:51,110
Ted?!

533
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,520
Oh! My good God!

534
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:59,390
Let's have a look at you! You've
shrunk, you wizened ole bugger!

535
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,310
But I thought...
I lied!

536
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:02,750
He lied! What a liar!

537
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:05,270
He had his leg in plaster!
We saw it on the... It was pretend!

538
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,630
Cement! Paint.
Did you know?

539
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:08,670
Cement?!

540
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:12,390
No! Did we 'ell, he just turned up
on t'doorstep like an hour ago.

541
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:15,200
Celia Armitage!
Ted Buttershaw.

542
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:19,430
Oh, give over!
Always a handful.

543
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,710
So when...what...when did you land?

544
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,670
I don't know. Couple of hours ago?

545
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:27,390
And is all the family with you?
No, sod 'em. Just me.

546
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,800
Who cares?

547
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:42,590
I think you and our Gillian
should get back together.

548
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,310
So do I.

549
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,150
Is this why you've invited me?

550
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:48,350
Is it 'ell.
No!

551
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:51,590
Have you ever seen a banana jump?

552
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,030
No.

553
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,590
Me neither.

554
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:57,150
I think they must do it at night.

555
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,120
THEY CHUCKLE

556
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:02,790
I'm wi' Cheryl now anyway, so.

557
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:08,150
Oh, Robbie. She's very nice,
is Cheryl, obviously, but...

558
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:10,470
She's a lightweight,

559
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,590
compared to our Gillian.

560
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:15,870
You do deserve better.
And who better than my mum?

561
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:20,310
She's got personality,
Gillian. And balls.

562
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,070
I like a woman with balls.

563
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:24,390
Listen,
I don't want to upset or offend

564
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:26,470
by reminding you about
the ins and outs of why me

565
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:29,070
and Gillian fell out...
Why did you fall out?

566
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:31,870
We do know she's a handful.

567
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:34,190
More than a handful,
let's be honest. She's...

568
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:35,950
She's trouble. No two ways.

569
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:38,230
She always was.
Is she?

570
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:39,590
But...
She's worth it.

571
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,710
..it's part of her charm.

572
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:45,270
And it's only a fella like you,
a fella with your sort of calibre,

573
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:49,670
could rise to that
sort of a challenge.

574
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:53,280
I suspect. But heck!
What do I know?

575
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:57,630
Who told you this?

576
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:01,000
I... We... It's...
I shouldn't...

577
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,870
I only told you because I
thought you'd see the funny side.

578
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:07,230
I didn't...
think you'd tell your mum.

579
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:10,150
What do you mean "the funny side"?
Mum, let's not spoil...

580
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,430
I didn't...
I didn't mean...

581
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:14,070
I don't understand what's
being said.

582
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:16,830
I thought it'd be better if I told
her than if she found out later

583
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,630
from anyone else. That's all, sorry.

584
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:22,230
Sorry, I am sorry. He's too soft.
He's too kind-hearted.

585
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,590
That's the top and bottom of it.
Exactly.

586
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,870
I've been telling him
this all his life, Celia.

587
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,990
It's a generous fault.
Well, all my life.

588
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,230
Obviously.
Not that...not that...not that...

589
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:34,910
So...? So.

590
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:37,110
So... So...

591
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:38,950
They've put an offer in
on a bungalow.

592
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:43,630
Dependent on my dad selling our old
house up Barkisland.

593
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:49,310
But he, being Dad, was too soft
to turf the tenants out.

594
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:51,470
And in the meantime
someone else put a better

595
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:54,030
offer in on the bungalow,
and of course they went with it.

596
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:57,710
The vendors.
Oh, dear! Oh, good Lord!

597
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:00,750
Celia, I'd have thought you had him
better trained than that by now!

598
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,510
Clearly not.

599
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:04,240
Not yet.

600
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:13,000
THEY HOWL WITH LAUGHTER

601
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,470
I'm not laughing at her, I'm...

602
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:26,800
No. No. But you're right,
she is...very entertaining.

603
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,520
By the way...

604
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,630
..I've been meaning to say...

605
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,160
What?

606
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:48,040
Are we still cool? Vincent.

607
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,520
Yep.

608
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:00,270
I know you never forgave me
over Frank.

609
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,990
Oh, bugger Frank.

610
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,760
Does that mean you have?

611
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:09,680
Did you ever know how miserable
I was with Kenneth?

612
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:11,870
No.

613
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,430
For years.

614
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,230
No.

615
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:19,600
I married him on the rebound, I
know that now, looking back, but...

616
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:26,270
..he was shallow, a lightweight.
He mucked around.

617
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:31,230
The night I gave birth to Caroline,
the night I nearly died

618
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:33,710
when I needed that
blood transfusion,

619
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:36,630
he was off having sex with
someone else.

620
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:40,670
I know because 15 years later
he told me.

621
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:42,350
SHE SIGHS

622
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,320
It doesn't matter now.

623
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:49,670
Well, except it does.

624
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,670
You'd never have had Caroline.

625
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,000
No.

626
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,960
No, I'd never have had Caroline.

627
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:01,360
But I might have been happy.
Happier.

628
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,950
It happened. We can't change it.

629
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:08,710
No. No, we can't.

630
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:11,030
And now...

631
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,670
I've met Alan again.

632
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:15,590
Everyone liked Alan.

633
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,910
Alan was always special.

634
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:22,920
I'm glad you're so happy, Celia.

Wow, OK, here goes.

687
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:09,990
Well...when my mum told me
she was getting married again,

688
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:15,750
I said, "Yes, Mother,
shall we discuss it in the car?"

689
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:18,830
And she said, "We are serious,
you know," and I said,

690
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:20,990
MOUTHS: Whatever.
LAUGHTER

691
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,240
But she was serious!
And they did it, and here we are.

692
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:27,920
My mum...

693
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:30,710
..is unique.

694
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:35,750
She's clever, she's funny,

695
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:40,990
she's supportive, she's very loving

696
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,960
and she's very kind.

697
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:46,710
She also likes to say it
like it is now and again,

but I think Alan's ready for that.

699

And I think Alan deserves
someone as wonderful as my mum

00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:57,390
because he is, without doubt,
one of the loveliest,

privileged to have been part of it.

I've always known Alan,
I can't remember not knowing Alan.

712
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:44,230
One of my earliest memories of Alan
was down Elland Wood.

713
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:46,070
We were about four years old and

714
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:48,390
we'd just found a pond full
of frogspawn,

715
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:50,150
and he wanted to take it home,

716
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:53,310
like you do,
only we'd nowt to carry it in.

717
00:44:53,320 --> 00:45:00,430
So he said, "Harry, you take your
wellies off, they'll do,"

718
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:04,310
and course, like a dozy bugger,
I did.

719
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:07,990
He had his wellies on as well,
I hasten to add,

720
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,830
but for some reason in his head
mine were the only ones with

721
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:14,510
"frogspawn container"
written on 'em.

722
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:19,470
Then at home, me mother'd be saying,
"How come Alan's always so tidy,

723
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:21,710
"and you're always such
a mucky mess?" All right?

724
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:24,670
I was being shamelessly
taken advantage of...

725
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:25,910
Are you? Yeah.

726
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:28,990
..by someone much cleverer than me.
Alan was always very dapper.

727
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,110
How's Cheryl?

728
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:33,360
She's fine, yeah.

729
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:35,790
Good.

730
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:38,710
..he got that cushy job at Jessop's
Chemicals up Huddersfield...

731
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:41,710
It's a nice do. Yeah.

732
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:43,430
Thanks for asking.

733
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:45,270
Me dad.

734
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:48,440
It were me dad, not me. Mm, OK.

735
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:53,190
OK. He invited me on his stag do
last night, did he tell you?

736
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:54,470
No.

737
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:56,600
Did you not know?
No.

738
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:59,670
OK.

739
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:02,120
He does what he likes. Yeah.

740
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:09,230
He were saying... Eh?

741
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:11,870

742
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:13,360
What?

00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:23,590
Doesn't matter.

746

No, seriously, though,
