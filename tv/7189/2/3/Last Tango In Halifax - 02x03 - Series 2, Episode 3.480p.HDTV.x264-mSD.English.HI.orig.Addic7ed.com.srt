1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:04,550
I want a baby.
I mean, how...how would it work?

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,750
Well, obviously a donor.

3
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:09,920
She's pregnant. It's mine.

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,790
I'm not having that lad
leaving school,

5
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:18,310
he could get into university.

6
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,910
Just as long as you know that
I can't see Caroline short either.

7
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,670
Bloody Caroline.

8
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:27,390
What's up with Caroline?
I thought you were mates? Nothing.

9
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,950
I know you said you're seeing
Robbie, but, frankly,

10
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:32,830
I think you and me both know that
is a disaster. Really?

11
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:35,710
Are you doing anything this weekend?

12
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:37,750
Thing is, we're married now.

13
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,000
You did it?
Yeah, course we did it.

14
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,990
I mean...you know.

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,310
Just disappointed.

16
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,710
We didn't want a fuss.

17
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,910
Fair enough, but if I'm being
honest, I'm with 'Arry.

18
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:36,990
Disappointed.

19
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,310
Yeah, well, it's done now, so...

20
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,870
What are we going to call this baby?

21
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,510
What does it look like?

22
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,190
You can see what it looks like.

23
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:50,070
No, I mean does it look like
a Heather? Or a Barbara?

24
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,070
Or a...Claudette?

25
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:56,310
I think it looks like a bad-tempered
beetroot, personally. But...

26
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,830
Right! It's had enough, it wants
to get its windy-pops up now.

27
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,720
Does great grandad Harry want
to do the honours?

28
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,550
"Oh, great grandad Harry, I much
prefer you to great grandad Alan,

29
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:15,350
"because I know that if it'd
been you getting wed, and you'd

30
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,270
"asked him to be your best man,
you'd not have gone sneaking off..."

31
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,470
He wasn't going to ask you,
he'd asked me.

32
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,440
He asked me.
He asked me.

33
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,110
He asked me.

34
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,390
I didn't ask either of you.
You volunteered.

35
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,870
Which I was very flattered by,
and touched, but you're my pals!

36
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:39,150
I couldn't say no to either of you!
So...

37
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,990
And it was what Celia wanted.

38
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,430
What Celia wanted.

39
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,870
I'm sick of having to
explain myself.

40
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:48,550
She leads you by t'nose.
You know that, don't you?

41
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,310
What did she say?

42
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,710
"I don't want either of them

43
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,990
"two scruffy buggers
being your best man?"

44
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,390
Hey. You talk for yourself...

45
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,350
Funnily enough,
you weren't mentioned.

46
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,280
I scrub up very nicely, thank you.
Are we going to let this drop?

47
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,590
Where is Celia?

48
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,110
Harrogate. Oh, she's coming back.

49
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,880
She's just popped over to fetch
a few bits and pieces.

50
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,750
I mean, can you imagine?

51
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:22,270
She literally didn't know
she was pregnant, she said,

52
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,310
and then - clang - there it is.

53
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:29,070
A baby. I think she's in shock,
I think they all are.

54
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,670
Hello, Celia!

55
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,750
Oh. I thought he'd moved out.

56
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,350
No! Not entirely, not yet.

57
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,110
It hasn't even got a name.

58
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,750
They're calling it "The Baby".

59
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,550
And is it...definitely his?

60
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,190
Oh, yeah. First thing Gillian did was
go down to t'chemist

61
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:47,070
and buy a paternity testing kit.
God.

62
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:51,510
So...Ellie is living at the farm
with "The Baby".

63
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,070
What does her mother think?

64
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,990
Oh, she wants her back home
and at school.

65
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,910
Only I don't think she's
facing the facts.

66
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,790
She's not prepared to help out.

67
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:02,190
She has this high-powered
highly-paid job in the NHS

68
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,230
shuffling papers off her desk
onto somebody else's,

69
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:08,750
which she has made it plain she's not
prepared to give up,

70
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:11,430
or even go part-time,
and why should she?

71
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:16,350
But what she's not addressing is
the situation as it stands.

72
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:21,030
And the husband's no better, he's
a quantity surveyor in Dewsbury.

73
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,390
Divorced.

74
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,550
And he has opinions as well,
but nothing that alters the facts.

75
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,150
So, what's going to happen?

76
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,430
Well, they seem determined to muddle
through at the farm.

77
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,590
Everyone's helping out.
Gillian, Robbie...

78
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,390
How is Gillian?
Harry, me, Alan...

79
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,710
I think I've changed its nappy
as often as anyone.

80
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,790
I mean, they do nowt, Raff and Ellie.

81
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,630
Is she still seeing Robbie? Gillian.

82
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,750
I think they're frightened of it,

83
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:49,710
and it's a sweet enough
little thing.

84
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:54,310
It sickens me, when there's folks
want babies and can't,

85
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,110
you know, honest, hard-working,
decent people...

86
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:01,590
Has it...she really not got a
name?

87
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,150
Well, nothing that's stuck.
Gillian calls her Flossie,

88
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,790
which to me is more what you might
call a King Charles Spaniel.

89
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,830
Alan calls her Emily Jane,

90
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,550
but that's just so he can make it
rhyme with stuff.

91
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:20,150
Harry calls her
Foo-Foo Tinkerbell or summat.

92
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,230
But he's an...idiot.

93
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,190
But she's coping? Gillian.

94
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,790
What would you call a baby?
If you had one?

95
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,990
Oh, well, for a girl, I've always
liked Emily.

96
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,070
And with Alan. It's good, it's...

97
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,870
Or Victoria, Virginia, Elizabeth,
Charlotte.

98
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:39,790
Those sort of more traditional
names...Helen, Helena, Eleanor.

99
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:43,630
Oh, no, that's Ellie. Or...or
something pretty. Like Flora.

100
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:47,670
Jasmine. Poppy! Grace. That's nice.

101
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,910
Celia! You've got a lovely name.

102
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:53,830
And there's Rose, Rosie, Ros,
Rosamund, Rosalind...

103
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,550
Florence, Maisie, Daisy...

104
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,870
retro, I know, but it's very sweet.
I don't know!

105
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,000
It'll all depend on what
Caroline thinks.

106
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,630
What would?
What's it got to do with Caroline?

107
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:08,110
I mean, if ever...if, if...me and
Caroline...

108
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:11,430
Which, why would we?
..had to choose a baby name.

109
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,070
You and Caroline?
You and Caroline?

110
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,600
Not, not, not that...

111
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,950
Well, you wouldn't have to.
Would you?

112
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,270
Well, no, women...lesb...

113
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,390
Ladies...do have babies.

114
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,600
Do they?

115
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,910
How.

116
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,520
Well, if...

117
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,830
You're not, are you? She's too old.

118
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,510
Yeah, well, she isn't,
technically, and I'm not.

119
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,030
So, hypothetically, in theory...

120
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:45,710
She'd not want to go through
all that again at her age.

121
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,360
No...no.

122
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,590
Where did you say she was?

123
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:58,230
The year-12s are doing
King Lear tonight. So...

124
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,750
That'll be one to
slit your wrists to.

125
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:04,270
So, is that is that something
you're serious about?

126
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:07,390
No. God, no. Is Alan next door?

127
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,070
No, I've left him in Halifax.

128
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:12,070
I just popped over to
get a few bits.

129
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,630
Well...and I wanted five minutes
with Caroline.

130
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:18,550
Any road, will you tell her to pop
round when she's got a minute?

131
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,750
Sure. I mean, not tonight.

132
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:24,480
If she's had to sit through King Lear
she'll just want to lie down.

133
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,830
DOOR CLOSES

134
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,310
SHEEP BLEAT

135
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,550
There.

136
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,360
MOBILE RINGS

137
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,870
Hello.

138
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,510
Gillian. It's John.

139
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,560
Yeah.

140
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,150
Sorry. Erm.
I never rang you back last week

141
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:58,390
cos I heard what had happened
and I didn't want to pester you.

142
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,230
Sounds like you've
had your hands full.

143
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,630
Yep.

144
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:04,120
How's...how's...how are things?

145
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,190
Complicated.

146
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:10,030
Right. I was serious
about what I said.

147
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:13,190
About putting money...in my farm?

148
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,870
I would do that, but I meant
more about you.

149
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:18,390
You know, I can't help
thinking it's a mistake.

150
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,230
Right.

151
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,630
I still think about you
all the time.

152
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:26,270
I've started writing again.
John, I...

153
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,590
I wonder if getting the push
from the publisher was

154
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,520
the kick up the arse that I needed.

155
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,910
It's about you.

156
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,510
Well, sort of about you.

157
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:39,510
It's about everything.
Everything that's happened.

158
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:43,230
Celia and your dad meeting up again
after all this time.

159
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:47,950
And...mad bitch here,
and her mousey little girlfriend.

160
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:52,070
But your character's
the real central...the...

161
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,790
..point of it all really.
The lynch pin.

162
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,830
The...well, the heroine...

163
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:03,190
..if you like. Gillian?

164
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,870
Right. OK.

165
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:09,030
So, you see...it would
be lovely to meet up.

166
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,510
I don't have to come to the house.
The farm.

167
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:15,470
If that's complicated.
We could just...go out for dinner.

168
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,880
Or a drink.

169
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,560
Hello?

170
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,630
I can't. It's too messy.

171
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,270
I have to go now.

172
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:28,710
Gillian... I'm sorry, I'm hanging
up. I'm glad you're working again.

173
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,440
Bye...bye. Bye-bye.

174
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,630
How was school?

175
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,670
Fine.

176
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,030
She been all right?

177
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,830
No, we sold her to a Chinaman.

178
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,310
Right.

179
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,480
We didn't get much for her.

180
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,350
Have you had something to eat?

181
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,910
Toast.

182
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,630
Toast.

183
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,630
Are you managing to concentrate?

184
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,630
Yeah.
I mean, at school.

185
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,470
Yes!

186
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,480
She needs her nappy changed.

187
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,670
HE JANGLES TOY

188
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:11,440
Little Nelly needs her nappy changed,
kids.

189
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,030
I said,
the baby needs its nappy changed.

190
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,790
Grandad! What y' doing?
Ooh, knackers!

191
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:24,390
Were you saving the universe?
Y'shouldn't have done that.

192
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:27,070
It's not real. Me and your grandad
lived through the Blitz.

193
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,110
Did you 'eck.
Blitz was in t'big cities.

194
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,990
Halifax got one bomb dropped on it,
and that were by accident

195
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,550
cos some plank in the Luftwaffe
couldn't find Manchester.

196
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,030
Oh, they know it all don't they?

197
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:39,070
Except, oh, yeah,
how to avoid getting pregnant.

198
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,350
We wouldn't have made that mistake,
would we, Alan?

199
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,920
Eh? Blitz or no Blitz...

200
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,440
HE STOMPS UPSTAIRS

201
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,360
DOOR SLAMS

202
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,880
HE CRIES

203
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,080
KNOCKS ON DOOR

204
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,160
It's me.

205
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,550
Can I come in.

206
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,680
Why are you even friends with him?

207
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,280
It isn't really about him, is it?

208
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,520
I've got to earn some money,
grandad.

209
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,880
Going to school now,
it's just ridiculous

210
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,990
I told him,
he can get a job soon enough,

211
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,760
but I'd be sickened
if he left school, Celia.

212
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,150
Celia?
So, there's no point us looking

213
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,590
for a little bungalow now then,
is there?

214
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,550
Well, we can look, but,

215
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,870
you see, when I was his age,
well, you an' all,

216
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,550
it were never an option.

217
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:18,510
Were it? Staying on at school.

218
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:21,350
If he'd just get his A levels,

219
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,910
he'd always be able to try
for a university at a later stage.

220
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:28,870
Wouldn't he? Which...
well, that's important.

221
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:32,870
Trouble is, he wants to do the
right thing, which I understand,

222
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:36,470
but t'difficulty is,
knowing what the right thing is

223
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,590
when everybody seems to have
so many different opinions.

224
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,110
Yeah. I think somebody at school's
said something nasty

225
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,310
that's upset him.

226
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,790
Well, they will do, they're kids.

227
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,510
I don't want him ending up in
a job wi' no prospects,

228
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:53,550
and then for her to just up-sticks
and beggar off anyway

229
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,630
with the baby, which you never know.

230
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:59,830
I mean, I don't know whether they're
still actually seeing one another.

231
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:02,310
I don't even know that they
ever were

232
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,240
beyond this one evening
of Malibu-fuelled passion.

233
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,630
I know he was smitten with her
before, but

234
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:14,110
I'm not so sure now and
she doesn't seem bothered about

235
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:17,270
owt much at the minute,
him included.

236
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,750
You're not telling me
anything I don't know.

237
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,630
I have been there a week.

238
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:25,990
I know, I'm just...I'm struggling
to make sense of it myself.

239
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,750
The more I think about it,
worse it seems to get.

240
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:33,710
It's a mess, Celia.
It's a right bloody mess.

241
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:37,150
Yeah,
but you haven't to get stressed.

242
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:39,520
Oh...I'm all right.

243
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,670
I'm missing you.

244
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,150
I'm missing you.

245
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:48,870
CAR APPROACHES
Oh, hey up. Madame Lazonga's back.

246
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,280
Who?
Our little Caroline.

247
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,790
Hey,
what do you think about Cordelia?

248
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,310
For a name. It's King Lear.
There's three of them.

249
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,150
Daughters - Goneril, Regan
and Cordelia.

250
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,590
I think of the three...

251
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:09,430
Goneril!
Oh, y'just wouldn't, would you?

252
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,070
There's no wonder
they wanted him dead.

253
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,320
Dozy old bugger.

254
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,000
Kate?

255
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,760
Are you all right?

256
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,920
How was King Lear?

257
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:56,190
It was very good,
I was very proud of them.

258
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:59,190
Your mum's back.
I saw the car.

259
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,200
She said to pop round. Not tonight.

260
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,630
Have you been crying?

261
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:07,350
Just feeling sorry for myself.

262
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,710
Why?

263
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:12,470
Not Lawrence. No.

264
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,270
John? No!

265
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,120
My mother? No.

266
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,960
What then?

267
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,280
Do you want to tell me
about it in bed?

268
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,600
Have you been eating peanuts?

269
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,270
Popcorn at the interval...
That'd do it.

270
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,430
..but I've drunk a whole glass of
wine since then!

271
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,720
That'd wash off any...
Not necessarily. Get the...

272
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:53,750
Where's your handbag?
In there.

273
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,790
Do you want me to do it?
Do you want to do it?

274
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,430
No, you.

275
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,520
SHE WHEEZES AND COUGHS

276
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:05,430
Here, just right there.

277
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,790
You're going to be fine.
I'm going to be fine.

278
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,320
SHE CONTINUES TO COUGH

279
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,760
Ambulance.

280
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:18,070
Caroline Elliot,
46 Conway Drive,

281
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,560
Harrogate, HG3 2MC.

282
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,320
I've got someone with anaphylaxia.

283
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,830
Thank you.

284
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:30,870
Four minutes. God, I'm sorry.

285
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,190
I'm fine.

286
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,710
Stupid thing to do!

287
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,230
I don't think I need an ambulance.

288
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,760
It's on its way, it's coming.

289
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,030
Y'have to massage it after
you've injected.

290
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,320
Let me.

291
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:46,030
What were you upset about?

292
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,400
Just.

293
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,160
Babies.

294
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,920
Kate's just had, erm...

295
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,320
I wasn't, uh...

296
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,880
We weren't...

297
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:26,470
You want to get yourself to
bed,

298
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,470
you've got school tomorrow.

299
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,600
I might sleep down here tonight.

300
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,590
Why?

301
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,480
Just...
that camp bed's not right comfy.

302
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,630
We should get you a double bed.

303
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,910
Would a double bed fit in that room?
With a cot.

304
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,270
When we get the cot.

305
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:48,670
I'm fine sleeping down here.

306
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:51,750
What about when little doo-dah needs
feeding during the night?

307
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,590
You can't leave it all to Ellie.

308
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,670
I'll hear her, I'll help her.

309
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,310
You mightn't.

310
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,280
I just, don't want to crowd her.

311
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,950
Who?

312
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,160
Ellie.

313
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,920
We need another bedroom.

314
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,470
I'll get you that other duvet...

315
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,080
out of the airing cupboard.

316
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,110
Hospital?

317
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,230
She'll be fine, it happens.

318
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,990
I've given her the morning off work,
anyway.

319
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,070
Oh, hell, steady on.
You don't want to be spoiling her.

320
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,070
Are you just here to dazzle us
all with your sparkling wit

321
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,190
or do you want something?

322
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,590
I haven't see you for a week!

323
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,870
Have I changed?

324
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,190
No, you're just as gorgeous.

325
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,670
Mm. So are you.

326
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:58,470
She said something droll yesterday,
did Kate.

327
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,390
Oh, what. We were discussing
babies' names, you know,

328
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:06,350
for little Fanny Alice
and...she talked like...

329
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:10,440
..you were thinking of having one.
You and her. I said "How?"

330
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,190
Oh, she, we...it's, it's not...

331
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,150
Where's my laptop? And my papers?
Sorry?

332
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,990
They were on the coffee table
in the sitting room. They were right
there in front of me.

333
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,830
Have you been buggering around in
there? It wasn't him, it was me.
I've confiscated them.

334
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:26,470
Where are they? I'm not telling you.
Where ARE they?

335
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,830
Why don't you talk to me
about Alison Waterhouse?

336
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:31,950
Who? "A flaccid, overripe fruit of
a woman."

337
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:34,990
I was experimenting with...
language, similes.

338
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,390
It's a metaphor.

339
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,430
It's a lazy metaphor, I mean, what
sort of fruit are we talking about?

340
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,910
A banana? A tangerine?

341
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,630
You know, people always think you've
based characters on them

342
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,110
and you haven't.

343
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:48,470
And can we leave Alison's
"dusky Negress" right out of it?

344
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,630
Or Matthew Waterhouse will be
getting his withering, shrivelling,

345
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:54,550
starved-of-light, pink little
bollocks chopped right off.

346
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,710
Right. Fine.

347
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,310
Is that what he's put?

348
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:59,830
Adjustments will be made.
Can I have it back?

349
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,670
No. You can whistle.
Caroline!

350
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:05,310
And what about Lizzie Cunningham?
Hmm?

351
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,830
"A latter-day Bathsheba Everdene"
no less,

352
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,110
who owns her own sheep farm

353
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,630
and has more suitors than
she knows what to do with.

354
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,070
Who does that remind us of?

355
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:15,550
"A sullen, sinewy 40-something
woman

356
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:19,150
"with the purposeful frame and
carriage of a 16-year-old boy".

357
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:21,510
Ooh, la-la! So...

358
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,470
Mummy isn't the only
gay in the village.

359
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,230
I'm sorry, I am sorry, I'm going
to have to ring Gillian...

360
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,830
You are not going to ring Gillian.

361
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:31,830
I am. I'm going to have to
ring Gillian.

362
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,390
You are not ringing Gillian!

363
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:37,360
Right!
Ring bloody sodding Gillian then!

364
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:41,550
Do you mind not using language like
that in front of my mother?

365
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,000
Give it me back.

366
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,310
CAROLINE!?!

367
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,750
What's he put about me?

368
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,550
It's not you...

369
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:53,350
The basic upshot is two people
in their 70s, in love,

370
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,270
who get together after...
ooh, 60 years?

371
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:59,110
But it's not about you, and then
their respective daughters -

372
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:02,030
Alison, the flaccid, overripe
fruit, who just happens to be

373
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:05,510
the headmistress of a very
marvellous public school,

374
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:09,510
and Lizzie, with the body of a
16-year-old boy, and a sheep farm.

375
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,150
I want to read it.

376
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,470
I've not written the
bloody thing yet!

377
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:16,990
No, and I don't think you should if
you're going to be rude about people.

378
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,550
Why were you even reading it anyway?

379
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,710
Cos you shouldn't leave
things chucking about.

380
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,750
If this is damaged,
you're paying for a new one.

381
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,200
Oh, that's happening.

382
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,910
Why is he even here?

383
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:32,110
Because he's got nowhere else to go.

384
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:35,630
He reckons to be looking for a flat
to rent near the university

385
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:38,110
till I can buy him out here,
and then he can buy somewhere.

386
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,750
I don't know.

387
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,030
Have you made any decisions yet?

388
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:44,720
It's all up in the air,
I'm afraid, love.

389
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,840
Go brush your teeth.

390
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,320
You know, Kate's up for it.

391
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:03,390
She's serious, she's had her house
valued, she's got it on the market.

392
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:06,480
OK. But she, erm...

393
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,760
OK. So, the thing is...

394
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,070
It's true. She does want a baby.

395
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,870
If she makes this commitment to me,
to me buying the house,

396
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,870
she wants us to...

397
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,030
How?

398
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:22,190
Oh, don't worry about that.
But the thing is...

399
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,710
Would you really want to go
through all that again?

400
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,950
No. It's unlikely that she'll
ever get pregnant.

401
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,670
She was pregnant four times
when she was married to Richard,

402
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:34,190
but she never got beyond the first
12 weeks.

403
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,270
She's 42,
I've been on the internet,

404
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:39,270
the chances of her getting
pregnant are minute.

405
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:42,030
And I think she'd be better
concentrating on her career,

406
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,150
she's very clever, but,
the thing is...

407
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,310
Sorry, you don't want to hear
this.

408
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,910
Oh, go on. It's her birthday this
coming weekend,

409
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,870
so I'm going to take
her...somewhere nice,

410
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,230
it's a little hotel I've found, and
I've booked it, and I'm going to...

411
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,160
to try and talk her out of it.
For her sake!

412
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:02,390
She'll only end up tearful and
disappointed when it doesn't happen.

413
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,710
I wondered
if you'd keep an eye on the boys?

414
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,150
You and Alan.

415
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:08,950
There's no point asking John,
he'll just get Judith round again

416
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,560
and trash the place.
Yeah, of course we will, love.

417
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,160
Thank you.

418
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,670
CAROLINE SIGHS WITH RELIEF

419
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:21,110
What are your plans today?

420
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:24,200
Oh, we're going looking at a
bungalow! Over at Ripponden.

421
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:28,040
You needn't look so worried,
we're only looking.

422
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,480
Good morning. Mrs Buttershaw?

423
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,550
How do you do.
You have picked a super day.

424
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:52,230
It's a smashing view.

425
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,310
Well, it's all in with the price.

426
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:57,430
And this is my husband.
And that's the baby.

427
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,830
We've not been married a week,
and look.

428
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:03,030
You can't hang about, y'see,
not when you get to our age.

429
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,430
Right.

430
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:08,790
He's pulling your leg, love. We're
actually the great grandparents.

431
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:12,550
I know! And me only 36.
Have you remembered the keys?

432
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,470
Yeah.

433
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:17,190
Boo! Boo! Yes!

434
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,160
Do you like it?

435
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:24,390
What do you reckon?
Oh, it's beautiful.

436
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,670
And we can afford it. Between us.

437
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,920
In theory.

438
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,910
I know.

439
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:34,070
It wouldn't need a lot doing.
Maybe a new bathroom,

440
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:37,600
but other than that.
That kitchen's beautiful.

441
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:43,560
We need to win t'lottery,
then we'd have enough for everybody.

442
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,200
Are we kidding ourselves?

443
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:51,000
I think so, don't you?

444
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:54,240
Way things are at the moment.

445
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,990
It's her mother and father that ought
to be forking out for stuff,

446
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,630
not you and Gillian.

447
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:04,750
You're giving her and the baby
a roof over their heads,

448
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:07,550
least they can do is
put their hands in their pockets.

449
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:10,270
Aye, but we can't make 'em, can we?

450
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:14,350
You know your little house,
up Barkisland. Yeah.

451
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:16,430
Have y'ever thought of getting
it valued,

452
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:20,150
and then asking Darren and Kimberley
if they'd like to buy it?

453
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,430
Then you'd not be turfing them out.

454
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:25,950
No. No, I hadn't thought of that.

455
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:28,310
Is it something you'd consider?

456
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,430
In theory. In practice I doubt it's
something they could afford to do.

457
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,680
Well, you don't know.

458
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:38,110
They might have parents that'd
like to try to help them along.

459
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,710
I can ask. But what'd be t'point?

460
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:44,720
If you're thinking of investing
more money in Caroline's house?

461
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:50,030
You realise the alternative
is you and me forever flitting

462
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:52,200
between Harrogate and Halifax.

463
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,910
Wouldn't it be nice to have
somewhere of our own?

464
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,750
Well, it would, but...

465
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:02,030
I think you should tell Darren
and Kimberley that

466
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:05,910
your circumstances've changed, and
you need the capital

467
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:09,230
out of that house, whether they can
afford to buy it or not.

468
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,440
Do you?

469
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,550
What's so funny?

470
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:16,590
You like home truths, don't you?

471
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:19,190
Now and again.
You like to call a spade a spade.

472
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,310
Yes, I do.

473
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:23,270
And here's some more...

474
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:25,870
I know you think Raff should
stop on at school,

475
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:28,110
and I do understand why.

476
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:31,390
But the fact is,
he's muckied his ticket.

477
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:34,070
And if you don't let him
take responsibility for it,

478
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,630
he'll never grow up.

479
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,430
Is that right?
You know it is.

480
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,030
Do you know what I think?

481
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,430
Fire away.

482
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:44,590
I think you ought to tell Caroline
to paddle her own canoe,

483
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,990
and cut her coat according
to her cloth.

484
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,990
Nobody needs a house that big.

485
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,950
There's only four of 'em,

486
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:54,110
and William'll be off to
university at the end of the summer.

487
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:56,870
He'll be back in the holidays.
Oh come on, Celia!

488
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:01,110
Her and Kate between 'em,
they must earn a six figure salary.

489
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,870
Well, I've no idea.

490
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,190
Easily. Caroline probably
earns that on her own.

491
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:10,230
Why should she expect
money from you as well?

492
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:13,630
Caroline was very good to me
after Kenneth died.

493
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,430
I'm sure she were, but now,

494
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:19,230
eight years on,
your circumstances have changed.

495
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,870
She should sell that house

496
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:25,200
and find somewhere just as lovely
only happen a bit smaller.

497
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:33,470
You do realise if you keep taking
that baby out so much,

498
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:37,520
it's going to get very
confused about who its mother is.

499
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,320
I'm serious!

500
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,230
What time will Gillian be home?

501
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,430
She's on t'late shift down at
Greenhough's.

502
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:57,230
They close at eight,
she's generally back by 20 past.

503
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,870
Is there anything I can be doing?

504
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,040
No, you're all right love.

505
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,510
It had a grand big sitting room.

506
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:08,070
They're very sought-after
properties them up there.

507
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,750
Are they? Oh, aye. It'd be a good
investment, if nowt else.

508
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:13,870
It won't hang around, even wi'
t'property market like it is.

509
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:18,510
I do like round here.
I suppose it feels like coming home.

510
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:20,550
Well, it is, isn't it?

511
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:23,830
Nearly.
Elland was our stomping ground.

512
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,430
What's Alan think?

513
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:29,270
Oh, he was just as taken
with it as I was.

514
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:32,750
Are they all right now?
Gillian and Alan?

515
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:36,630
Gillian and Alan? Yeah, I think so.

516
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:39,190
Cos you know she were really upset.

517
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,550
Oh, she was just bothered cos we
got married without telling anyone.

518
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,070
No, I mean before.

519
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,910
That whole two weeks
when you were over in Harrogate,

520
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:49,070
there were summat up.

521
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:53,030
Oh...something about Eileen.
Her mother.

522
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:55,400
Something about being disappointed...

523
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,800
Oh, I know what it was.

524
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:03,870
Gillian had an abortion, apparently,
when she was 15.

525
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:08,070
She had to leave school and, oh, it
all got brought up again,

526
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,510
and it all
seemed to be about that,

527
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:12,390
but don't say anything love.

528
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,990
I assume Raff doesn't know.

529
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,030
And what upset Gillian

530
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:20,600
was Alan saying how
disappointed her mother was.

531
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:26,080
That's all, it's all water under
t'bridge now, so.

532
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,480
I spoke to Greg.

533
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:32,470
You spoke to him? How?

534
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:35,830
He rang this afternoon.
Just before you got back from work.

535
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,960
He wants to pop over
for my birthday.

536
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,040
Actually on your birthday?

537
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,440
Well...

538
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:49,590
OK, but what if I'd made plans
for your birthday?

539
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,310
Have you?

540
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:55,110
You didn't, you didn't...what...
You didn't talk to him about...?

541
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,270
I mentioned it.
Mentioned it how?

542
00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:00,270
Well, I explained.
What we've discussed, and he said...

543
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:03,550
yeah, that he'd be more than happy
to help out.

544
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,870
We've not made any, you know,
plans.

545
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:08,600
Obviously. I said, obviously, you'd
want to meet him first.

546
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,950
I've booked a hotel
for a couple of nights.

547
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,870
Caroline.

548
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,510
Do you want me to cancel it?

549
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:18,950
No, oh, no...

550
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,600
but I want you to meet him. Soon.

551
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:26,350
Where is it? The hotel.
You're not suggesting...?

552
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:29,470
He could just meet us for a drink.
I'm not suggesting that we do the...

553
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:32,190
No, I'm just suggesting that you
meet him. Get to know him.

554
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,840
I don't need to get to know him.
You need to meet him.

555
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:43,480
It's a bad idea.
No. It's not. It's...

556
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:53,830
Fine, ask him for a drink. Maybe
it's better that we meet him there,

557
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,910
rather than here. What's the matter?
What's the matter is that

558
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:59,910
you're going to get pregnant,
possibly, with someone else, which

559
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:02,190
is fine in so far as you can't get
pregnant with me,

560
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,830
but beyond that...
It's...less fine.

561
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:07,750
There are things that I haven't...

562
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,680
processed, yet.

563
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:14,550
I assume I don't need to
spell them out.

564
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:16,760
It is the most likely way
for it to work.

565
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:24,670
You do know that whatever way,
it's kind of unlikely, don't you?

566
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:29,710
I know the odds aren't great. Yes.
I want to try though, Caroline.

567
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,950
And I'm terrified of leaving it any
longer.

568
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,390
What if it doesn't happen?

569
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:36,470
I'll deal with it.
You'll get upset. Well...

570
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:39,190
It's better to try and fail again

571
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,960
before I give up for good,
though, isn't it?

572
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:45,190
You've got a fantastic career.

573
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:48,310
You'll be the next head of languages
- you will, no contest -

574
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:52,430
you could be a deputy head in a few
very short years.

575
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,160
You've got what it takes, Kate.

576
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,240
I want to be somebody's mum.

577
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,800
Do you think we should get married?

578
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,120
Don't be daft.

579
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:56,790
Hiya!
Casserole for y'all in the oven.

580
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,190
Are you not stopping?

581
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,910
No, I'm...
I've got stuff to do at home.

582
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:03,150
What's up?

583
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:05,200
Did you have an abortion
when you were 15?

584
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:11,960
Was it mine?

585
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:14,920
Yeah.

586
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:19,030
Who's...? How's...?

587
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,480
Celia.

588
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:25,630
Celia? Just...chatting. Just asked
her why you and Alan fell out

589
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,510
when he stayed over in Harrogate.

590
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:29,670
You haven't to think, there was,
I never...

591
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,070
Why did you never tell me?

592
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,560
I was 15.

593
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,320
I'd forgotten.

594
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:40,030
It'd have been 30-odd now.

595
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,670
31.

596
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:45,030
I could never have had it.
There were no point telling you.

597
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,280
No.

598
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,560
I'm sorry. No, I'm just...

599
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:54,590
I just never knew.
I'd been a dad.

600
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,630
You weren't.

601
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:00,080
And then...
you went off with our Eddie.

602
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,990
I'm not being funny,
but I'm off home.

603
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,990
Right. And are you coming back?

604
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,960
Not tonight.
Will you ring me?

605
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,400
Are you dumping me?

606
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:15,720
I just don't want to be here.
For a bit.

607
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:20,950
So, how is this "not being funny"?
Then.

608
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:24,670
If you're "just going home"?
Are you feeling sorry for yourself?

609
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:26,710
Cos I was the one that had
to leave school,

610
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:29,510
I was the one that never got
a crack at their A levels.

611
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,270
And I could've done, I wasn't thick.

612
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:34,950
I never told you, but I never
inflicted anything on you either.

613
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,790
I'm going home.

614
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,200
Right.

615
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:53,470
(What a bitch.)

616
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:56,400
DOOR SLAMS AND POTS CLATTER

617
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,910
Is that you, love?

618
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,790
Yeah.

619
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,000
Yeah.

620
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:10,870
Yeah, it's me.
I fell asleep.

621
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:13,310
So did I.

622
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,390
Supper's ready. Where's Ellie?

623
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,080
Do you want to give her a shout?

624
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:23,310
Robbie's gone.
Has he?

625
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,790
Shall I set the table, love?

626
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:28,190
He's cooked everybody's tea,
and now he's gone.

627
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,150
I didn't know he was here.

628
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,510
You did.

629
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,910
Did I?

630
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,470
Oh, he's been asleep.

631
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,710
He's gone,
and he's not in a very good mood.

632
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,950
Has somebody said something to him?

633
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,750
What about?

634
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:43,400
Me. How do you mean? Oh. What?

635
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:50,800
Celia told Robbie that
I had an abortion when I was 15.

636
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:56,430
Well, the thing is,

637
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:59,830
he asked me why you
and your dad'd fallen out, so...

638
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,950
It was his. Whose?

639
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,670
Robbie's. Robbie...?

640
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:06,710
So, and he never knew
and now he does.

641
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:09,430
So, he's gone. Robbie?

642
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:12,550
I used to see him
before I started seeing Eddie.

643
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:15,270
Well, I...I didn't know that.

644
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,870
Why were you telling him
stuff about me anyway?

645
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,960
Hey, just...let's just calm down.

646
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:24,390
I'd no idea.

647
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:28,510
Yeah. But what you do know,
Celia, what you must know,

648
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:33,310
is that at the best of times that is
a pretty indiscreet thing

649
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:35,950
to be saying about somebody
to people.

650
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:38,990
She didn't know.
I mean, I didn't know.

651
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,790
Yeah, but you get the bigger point?

652
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,630
She says she doesn't want any tea,
she says she's not hungry.

653
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:46,190
I'm sorry. I am sorry, Gillian.

654
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,760
Well, he's gone anyway.

655
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,710
You know what?

656
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:53,240
I mean, that is...you're...

657
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:57,830
It's poisonous. Saying something
like that.

658
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:00,870
I mean, you don't even know us.
You don't know me.

659
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:04,710
To say something like that to
somebody

660
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:08,990
when you've got no
idea of the consequences...

661
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,230
Gillian.

662
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,550
What's going on?

663
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:14,590
Perhaps you'd like to
tell our Raff as well, Celia?

664
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,870
Tell me what?

665
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:18,230
Look. I've said I'm sorry.
If I'd known I'd not have...

666
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:21,350
I had an abortion
when I was 15. Didn't I, Celia?

667
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:23,550
Do you want to go up
and tell Ellie as well?

668
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:25,190
Who did? You did?

669
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,590
Yeah.

670
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,440
You did? Yeah.

671
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:35,430
It was Robbie's and he never knew.

672
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:38,470
But he does now, because Celia's
just told him,

673
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,840
and now he's gone.

674
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:45,510
Robbie? Not me dad?

675
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,510
Ellie needs to eat.

676
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:50,870
She can't not eat, it's only been
a week since she gave birth.

677
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:54,350
Now, go upstairs and tell
her to come down here. Now. Go on.

678
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:57,510
Look, I'm wondering if it was
better if I went home to Harrogate.

679
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:00,470
No, it's fine. Look, Celia made
a mistake.

680
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,710
She's apologised.

681
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:04,030
Oh, that's all right then.

682
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:06,910
Look, I think I will, I'm popping
upstairs to get my things.

683
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:10,590
What if I went and talked to Robbie?
No.

684
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,590
Were he cross? Quiet.

685
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:15,070
Well, then why don't I just
pop down to his house and...

686
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:17,720
No. I've said. You leave it.
I'm going.

687
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:22,110
Well, if Celia's going back to
Harrogate, I'll be going with her.

688
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:25,390
You know...I don't recognise
you any more.

689
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:30,910
Going looking at dozy big bungalows
that you know you can't afford...

690
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,270
Go get your things.

691
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:35,070
Chucking your money away on
flash cars that eat petrol and

692
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:37,710
bugger up the environment.
Not wanting anybody there

693
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:41,750
when you get wed.
Me, Raff, your mates. Why? Eh? Why?

694
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,600
That is so not you.

695
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:49,030
And, you know, I have to be frank...

696
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:52,590
Dad, I don't like it.

697
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:55,390
I'm aware of that...

698
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,120
I'm increasingly aware of it.

699
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:01,350
Shall I tell you something? I have
spent my life watching you

700
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:04,590
go after unsuitable beggars one
after other!

701
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:07,310
You know what me
and your mother always used to say?

702
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:09,070
Don't say stuff about my mum.

703
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:13,150
"Oh, aye, our Gillian,
she always used to pick 'em."

704
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:15,150
Like it were funny.

705
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:17,030
But it weren't.

706
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,350
And have I ever fallen out with
you about it?

707
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:22,710
Ever?
All bloody stupid stuff you did.

708
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:26,120
All the bloody dozy stuff Eddie did.
No.

709
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:30,720
I were here all the time,
whenever you needed me.

710
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:35,390
You know what I'm talking about.
So, don't you dare...

711
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:38,950
She's a shit-stirrer!
DON'T YOU DARE

712
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,520
say ANYTHING about Celia to me.

713
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:02,190
"Poisonous."
I could've been in tears.

714
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:05,270
Do you want me to get involved?
Do you want me to ring her?

715
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:08,630
No.
I'm off! Oh, hello, Celia.

716
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:11,230
Hello, love.
See you there.

717
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:12,910
Yeah.

718
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,280
OK, bye.

719
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:20,910
Is Alan all right? Is he here?

720
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:23,190
We drove back last night.
Did you not hear us?

721
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:26,430
How is he?
I think he's had enough of her.

722
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:28,030
I think, between you and me,

723
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:31,270
it sounds like she's been a bit
of a bloody nuisance all her life.

724
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,270
Never at school.

725
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:36,560
This is after
she went back, after the abortion.

726
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:40,030
Always over in Manchester at night.

727
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:44,360
Pink hair, green eyebrows,
studs everywhere.

728
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:49,110
Course this was when she started
bothering with him.

729
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,550
Eddie.

730
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,080
Bloody Eddie.

731
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:57,230
Then a few other little incidents -
shoplifting, joyriding.

732
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:58,750
It was all him.

733
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:01,160
But she were just daft enough to
go along with it.

734
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:07,030
And who was it used to have to go
doing all the apologising,

735
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:11,710
making amends and pointing out that
she wasn't from a bad home,

736
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:15,270
she'd had a perfectly good
upbringing, thank you...

737
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:18,110
..and we were just as
upset and bemused

738
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:20,320
by t'way she carried on as
anyone else.

739
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,910
Well...

740
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:27,030
I'm sorry you've had it
all to put up with.

741
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,520
Aye, well...

742
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:32,360
Makes you wonder why you bother.

743
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,190
Well, that can't be any good for
him. Not with his condition.

744
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,750
He's fine, he says.

745
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:41,910
He says as long as he's with me,
nothing else matters.

746
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,510
I might ring her.

747
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:46,480
Oh, I wouldn't.
You know she doesn't like you.

748
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,950
You shouldn't say things like that.

749
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,430
She's right jealous of you.

750
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:54,190
Oh, I don't...I've never...

751
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:56,230
You don't see it.

752
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:58,720
Right, well, OK.
I'll keep out of it then.

753
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:01,990
Mum!

754
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,350
Morning.

755
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,400
Phone!

756
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:06,870
Who is it?

757
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,150
It's for you.

758
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:10,160
SHEEP BLEAT

759
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:18,910
Who?

760
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:20,240
Have you seen Ellie?

761
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:25,510
Bit early for Ellie,
isn't it? Who is it?

762
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:27,750
She's not upstairs.
She's not downstairs.

763
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,310
Her stuff's gone.

764
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:30,870
Well, she can't have just...?

765
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:33,630
I've rung her number.
There's no answer.

766
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:36,600
Well, when did she? I were up
at six o' clock. No idea.

767
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:39,670
Have you rung her mother's number?
No.

768
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:41,910
Right. I will.

769
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:43,870
Not that I imagine it'll do me
any good.

770
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:46,150
What're we going to with...?

771
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:48,990
I'm on a shift at Greenhough's
this aft.

772
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,550
Well, I'm going to have to
stop at home then.

773
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:53,840
No. That's...no.
You're going to school.

774
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:59,230
But you've fallen out wi' me
grandad again, haven't you, so...?

775
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:01,680
We'll manage. Won't we.

776
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:06,390
Eh? How? Little Flossie.

777
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,670
How will you manage?

778
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:11,390
I'll manage. You're going to school.

779
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:13,670
Hello?
Gillian. It's Caroline.

780
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:15,270
Go get ready, pack your bag.

781
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:16,720
(I mean it...)

782
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:19,510
Hello?

783
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:20,880
It's Caroline.

784
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:23,990
Caroline.

785
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,030
Sorry, are you busy,
is this a bad time?

786
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:30,230
What do you want?
If it's a bad time I'll ring later.

787
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:34,070
We've a lot on,
it's best to just spit it out.

788
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:37,070
OK. Well, look...

789
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:41,110
..obviously, I don't know everything
that's been said, but...

790
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:45,070
..my Mum came round this morning,
and, um...

791
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:48,630
..well, she was upset.

792
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:50,710
Was she.

793
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:51,950
(Why?) Shh.

794
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:55,070
I think she knows she's put
her foot in it, Gillian.

795
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:58,310
Yeah. Large style, big time.

796
00:43:58,320 --> 00:43:59,870
The thing is...

797
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:02,790
she delves. I've lived with
it all my life,

798
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:06,510
and I know that's possibly of
no comfort or...

799
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:09,870
I, on the other hand, haven't, and I
don't intend to start now.

800
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:12,750
OK, but can I just say that

801
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:15,240
she is very sorry and she is very
upset.

802
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:18,840
Gillian?

803
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:23,080
How's the baby?
It's...

804
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:32,350
It's a baby.

805
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:34,990
Yeah, well...

806
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,790
Babies are, aren't they?

807
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:40,350
I don't know what the hell
I'm doing.

808
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:42,870
I don't know whether I'm coming
or going, Caroline.

809
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,480
I don't know which way's up.

810
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:49,310
You're tired.
I can hear it in your voice.

811
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:51,270
I'm sorry I had a go at your mother,

812
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:54,670
but, conversely, on the other hand,

813
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:57,590
I'm sorry she put me
in a position where I had to.

814
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:00,480
I know, I know. I do know, Gillian.

815
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:04,750
I don't suppose there's anything I
can do?

816
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:06,150
Make excuses for me.

817
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:08,670
Tell her I'm mental.

818
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:12,190
Hormonal. Round the bloody bend.

819
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:14,870
Will everything be all right?
With Robbie?

820
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,310
(Which one's Robbie?)

821
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:18,550
(Shh) I dunno... (Policeman.)

822
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:21,550
..he's not rung me.
And I've not rung him. So...

823
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:23,040
But, you know.

824
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:26,430
I've got to go, Caroline.

825
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:29,160
I've a thousand
and million-one things to do.

826
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:35,190
Is me dad all right?

827
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:38,400
Yeah! Yeah.
I will keep an eye on him.

828
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:41,590
I appreciate you ringing.

829
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:43,920
Call me. Any time.

830
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:46,200
Thanks.

831
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:49,640
Bye. Bye. Bye.

832
00:45:56,040 --> 00:46:01,000
That...was your Auntie Caroline.

833
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:04,720
But right now...

834
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:10,240
..it's just you and me, kid.

835
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:32,800
That's terrific. Well, I'll start
the ball rolling, then.

836
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:41,870
And I'm pleased for you,
both of you.

837
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:46,070
It's a big thing,
yeah, it's a step forward.

838
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:47,950
(Who you talking to?)

839
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:50,240
OK, love. OK, will do.

840
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:53,360
Ta-ta.

841
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:56,350
It's Kimberley.

842
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:58,310
Darren's got his hours
back at the garage,

843
00:46:58,320 --> 00:46:59,710
and she's spoken to her mum and,

844
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:02,030
subject to us agreeing a price,
they would like to try

845
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:03,830
and raise a mortgage and buy it.

846
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:05,480
Oh!

847
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:09,910
Are you absolutely sure it's
what you want to do?

848
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:12,790
Yeah, I think so, yeah.

849
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:17,790
I'm not forcing you, I'm not leaning
on you, I'm not manipulating you.

850
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:20,390
You can manipulate me
any time you like.

851
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:22,190
What about Gillian?

852
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:25,510
Bugger Gillian. What about her?

853
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:27,910
I don't like all this bad feeling.

854
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:32,830
I need to ring an estate agent
and get an idea of a fair price.

855
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:34,550
And it was my fault.

856
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:38,200
You apologised. I offered to go
see Robbie. Forget her.

857
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:43,230
I think I might break it to
Caroline that I'm putting my money

858
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:46,590
elsewhere after they come
back from their mucky weekend.

859
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:49,150
What mucky weekend?

860
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:50,830
Oh, that reminds me.

861
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:53,790
They're going off on a mucky weekend.

862
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:57,670
I'm taking Kate to a nice little
hotel for the weekend, next weekend,

863
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:59,390
just for her birthday.

864
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:00,750
It's Kate's birthday,

865
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:03,790
so she's taking her somewhere
posh for a mucky weekend.

866
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:06,430
Granny will be here.
Granny and Alan.

867
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:08,150
Right.

868
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:09,270
Right.

869
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:12,070
And William,
but he'll be working, so...

870
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:15,790
We're baby-sitting the boys.
I did tell you.

871
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:17,390
OK?

872
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:18,630
Whatever.

873
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:21,150
Not that they need
baby-sitting at their age.

874
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:23,270
I mustn't have been listening.

875
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:24,750
Men don't.

876
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:25,990
Right, Mrs Buttershaw.

877
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,150
I need to do one or two more sums,
so we can weigh up

878
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:32,600
what sort of offer we'd be in a
position to make. Hmm?

879
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:35,670
Then I might take you out for lunch.

880
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:37,160
Oh.

881
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:46,880
Why don't you and Miss Mackenzie
drive to school together?

882
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:51,110
Because we don't always finish
work at the same time.

883
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:52,640
Please call her Kate.

884
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:56,080
Everyone knows, you know.

885
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:59,150
And you
need to stop kidding yourself.

886
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:01,030
cos you just look like a hypocrite.

887
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:03,270
Which is not a cool message to be
sending out to the

888
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:06,350
two-point-seven percent of kids
in this school who will one day

889
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:08,760
turn out to be muff-munching,
shirt-lifters.

890
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:13,640
I'll see you later.

891
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:28,350
She's taking Mackenzie
off on a dirty weekend next weekend.

892
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:29,950
My Granny's looking after us.

893
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:32,790
Do you want to come round and watch
Reservoir Dogs and get pissed

894
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:35,280
and trash the place? Yeah.

895
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:09,750
Hello.

896
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:10,960
Hi.

897
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:14,910
So...

898
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:16,720
Thanks for coming.
No problem.

899
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:20,920
Tea?

900
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:41,670
So, where's Ellie gone? Do we know?

901
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:44,430
I rang her mum
and she said she had no idea,

902
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:47,910
but then Harry phoned a bit later
and said she was there.

903
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:50,190
At her mother's. Silly bitch.

904
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:52,750
Are you all right?

905
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:53,920
Well...

906
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:58,800
everyone's fallen out with me,
again, so...

907
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:06,230
I'm kind of up shit creek
without a paddle, again...

908
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:08,280
..so, God, I don't know...

909
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:13,560
It's a bit mad, isn't it?

910
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:17,000
You and me.

911
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:21,790
Well, I don't know.
It's not very much madder than

912
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:23,720
almost everything else that's
happened.

913
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:27,280
I'm wondering if you're right.

914
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:31,110
About Robbie.

915
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:32,440
Me and Robbie.

916
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:35,070
Really?

917
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:37,600
It's not just. It's...

918
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:42,960
SHE SIGHS

919
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:46,520
I did this thing once.

920
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:51,120
I've never told anyone.

921
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:54,070
Except me dad knows.

922
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:55,240
What thing?

923
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:58,720
It was when Eddie died.

924
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:06,160
To us.

925
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:11,350
I could get used to this,
given another five minutes.

926
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:13,520
I think I already have.

927
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:17,230
To the manor born.

928
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:18,510
The good life.

929
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:20,400
Till death do us part.

930
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:26,390
I love you.

931
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:27,760
I love you.

932
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:32,350
I'm still feeling guilty.

933
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:34,230
So, don't.

934
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:36,430
I didn't even know
she knew Robbie then.

935
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:38,750
Let it go.

936
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:40,870
I can't come between you and her.

937
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:43,480
It's, I'd...I can't do that.

938
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:46,760
I want to tell you summat.

939
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:54,310
I nearly did once before but...

940
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:57,000
I couldn't, so I told you only half
a tale.

941
00:52:58,080 --> 00:53:00,000
It were when Eddie died.

942
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:05,520
I should've called an ambulance.

943
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:09,550
And I didn't.

944
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:13,520
And I'm telling you because...
it's been a burden to me for years.

945
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:18,350
He'd smashed his head open

946
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:20,640
with the
log splitter down in t'barn.

947
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:25,470
And when I met you
that day in Skipton...

948
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:28,030
and I remembered how much
I was in love with you.

949
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:30,030
I was so happy.

950
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:32,790
So properly happy.

951
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:34,600
Like I hadn't been for years.

952
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:38,550
With this...
business weighing me down.

953
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:40,000
So, what happened?

954
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:42,760
He'd done it on purpose...

955
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:44,840
he wanted to die.

956
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:49,240
But when I found him,
he wasn't dead.

957
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:54,760
And I should've called an ambulance,
but I didn't.

958
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:59,520
I should've helped him and
instead...

959
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:04,710
..I just watched him die.

960
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:06,950
I told you she didn't call
an ambulance,

961
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:08,480
but it were worse than that.

962
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:13,120
She'd finished him off...

963
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:15,840
..with a block of wood.

964
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:19,520
She killed him.

965
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:22,760
She said...

966
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:25,760
..she'd put him out of his misery.

967
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:33,840
There was nothing anybody
could've done for him.

968
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:39,360
And I'm telling you this because...

969
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:45,630
I'd be nervous about getting in
any deeper with Robbie, anyway.

970
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:49,230
Robbie knew.
He tried to get her arrested,

971
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:50,720
but he couldn't prove owt.

972
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:53,800
He was very fond of Eddie.

973
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:59,840
They were adopted, there was
only ever the pair of 'em.

974
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:06,760
Only person in the world who ever
mattered to him, really, was Eddie.

975
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:12,320
And me.

976
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:18,520
And I let Eddie die.

977
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:25,270
So, how did you know?

978
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:28,470
Well, she told me.
Soon as I got there.

979
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:30,910
I'm sorry I didn't tell you the
truth before.

980
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:33,230
But I couldn't,
I've never told anyone.

981
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:36,240
I didn't tell Eileen.
I couldn't have told Eileen.

982
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:40,150
So, we came up with this tale.

983
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:42,400
I used to have nightmares after.

984
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:45,960
I still do.

985
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,800
I sometimes wonder...

986
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:55,280
If it weren't...

987
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:57,800
..even suicide.

988
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:04,720
Although that's what coroner said.

989
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:09,870
The point is I've done
enough for her over the years -

990
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:13,520
apologising, covering stuff up
and now I'm happy...

991
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:17,310
..like I never imagined
I would be

992
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:20,120
or deserved to be ever again.

993
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:26,470
And now we're buying this bungalow

994
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:28,510
and I'm putting all that behind me.

995
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:29,960
I'm sorry.

996
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:34,310
Yep.

997
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:35,680
Blimey.

998
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:39,200
I am...

999
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:44,880
very fond of you.
And...I do think we could...

1000
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:49,040
..be good for each other.

1001
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:56,520
I'm going to look after the baby
while you do your shift at
Greenhough's.

1002
00:56:57,520 --> 00:56:59,310
You sure?

1003
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:00,640
Go to work.

1004
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:04,360
I can do babies.

1005
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:07,880
I'm very good with babies.

1006
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:23,280
BABY GURGLES

1007
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:28,910
So, you're her are you?
You're the whore.

1008
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:31,630
Greg! Kate.

1009
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:34,710
You're on the birth certificate
as the father? Well, not yet.

1010
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:36,310
Oh, well, you want to sort that out.

1011
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:39,670
Celia, it's William.
He's in Outpatients.

1012
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:41,390
Outpatients?

1013
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:44,150
You are unbelievable,
you know that, don't you?

1014
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:46,590
Somebody with a good heart
like you shouldn't have

1015
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:48,150
skeletons in their cupboard.

1016
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:49,750
I'm looking for John. Is he here?

1017
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:52,190
I want to have a child,
I want to get on with it.

1018
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:54,910
Something's happened.
I need you to tell him something.

1019
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:57,520
Bless you,
you were one of life's treasures.
