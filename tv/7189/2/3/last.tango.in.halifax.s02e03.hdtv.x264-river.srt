1
00:00:06,922 --> 00:00:10,141
I want a baby.
I mean, how... how would it work?

2
00:00:10,231 --> 00:00:12,430
Well, obviously a donor.

3
00:00:12,431 --> 00:00:15,591
She's pregnant. It's mine.

4
00:00:18,631 --> 00:00:21,470
I'm not having that lad
leaving school,

5
00:00:21,471 --> 00:00:23,990
he could get into university.

6
00:00:23,991 --> 00:00:28,590
Just as long as you know that
I can't see Caroline short either.

7
00:00:28,591 --> 00:00:30,350
Bloody Caroline.

8
00:00:30,351 --> 00:00:33,070
What's up with Caroline?
I thought you were mates? Nothing.

9
00:00:33,071 --> 00:00:35,630
I know you said you're seeing
Robbie, but, frankly,

10
00:00:35,631 --> 00:00:38,510
I think you and me both know that
is a disaster. Really?

11
00:00:38,511 --> 00:00:41,390
Are you doing anything this weekend?

12
00:00:41,391 --> 00:00:43,430
Thing is, we're married now.

13
00:00:43,431 --> 00:00:45,671
You did it?
Yeah, course we did it.

14
00:00:46,864 --> 00:01:20,648
<font color="#3399CC">Subtitles by </font><font color="ffffff">MemoryOnSmells</font>
<font color="#3399CC">http://UKsubtitles.ru.</font>

15
00:01:33,711 --> 00:01:35,670
I mean... you know.

16
00:01:35,671 --> 00:01:36,990
Just disappointed.

17
00:01:36,991 --> 00:01:38,390
We didn't want a fuss.

18
00:01:38,391 --> 00:01:41,590
Fair enough, but if I'm being
honest, I'm with 'Arry.

19
00:01:41,591 --> 00:01:42,670
Disappointed.

20
00:01:42,671 --> 00:01:45,990
Yeah, well, it's done now, so...

21
00:01:45,991 --> 00:01:48,550
What are we going to call this baby?

22
00:01:48,551 --> 00:01:50,190
What does it look like?

23
00:01:50,191 --> 00:01:51,870
You can see what it looks like.

24
00:01:51,871 --> 00:01:55,750
No, I mean does it look like
a Heather? Or a Barbara?

25
00:01:55,751 --> 00:01:57,750
Or a... Claudette?

26
00:01:57,751 --> 00:02:01,990
I think it looks like a bad-tempered
beetroot, personally. But...

27
00:02:01,991 --> 00:02:05,510
Right! It's had enough, it wants
to get its windy-pops up now.

28
00:02:05,511 --> 00:02:08,391
Does great grandad Harry want
to do the honours?

29
00:02:12,631 --> 00:02:17,230
"Oh, great grandad Harry, I much
prefer you to great grandad Alan,

30
00:02:17,231 --> 00:02:21,030
"because I know that if it'd
been you getting wed, and you'd

31
00:02:21,031 --> 00:02:24,950
"asked him to be your best man,
you'd not have gone sneaking off..."

32
00:02:24,951 --> 00:02:28,150
He wasn't going to ask you,
he'd asked me.

33
00:02:28,151 --> 00:02:30,111
He asked me.
He asked me.

34
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:32,790
He asked me.

35
00:02:32,791 --> 00:02:36,070
I didn't ask either of you.
You volunteered.

36
00:02:36,071 --> 00:02:40,550
Which I was very flattered by,
and touched, but you're my pals!

37
00:02:40,551 --> 00:02:44,830
I couldn't say no to either of you!
So...

38
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:47,670
And it was what Celia wanted.

39
00:02:47,671 --> 00:02:49,110
What Celia wanted.

40
00:02:49,111 --> 00:02:51,550
I'm sick of having to
explain myself.

41
00:02:51,551 --> 00:02:54,230
She leads you by t'nose.
You know that, don't you?

42
00:02:54,231 --> 00:02:55,990
What did she say?

43
00:02:55,991 --> 00:02:57,390
"I don't want either of them

44
00:02:57,391 --> 00:02:59,670
"two scruffy buggers
being your best man?"

45
00:02:59,671 --> 00:03:01,070
Hey. You talk for yourself...

46
00:03:01,071 --> 00:03:03,030
Funnily enough,
you weren't mentioned.

47
00:03:03,031 --> 00:03:05,951
I scrub up very nicely, thank you.
Are we going to let this drop?

48
00:03:08,631 --> 00:03:10,270
Where is Celia?

49
00:03:10,271 --> 00:03:11,790
Harrogate. Oh, she's coming back.

50
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:14,551
She's just popped over to fetch
a few bits and pieces.

51
00:03:22,951 --> 00:03:24,430
I mean, can you imagine?

52
00:03:24,431 --> 00:03:27,950
She literally didn't know
she was pregnant, she said,

53
00:03:27,951 --> 00:03:29,990
and then - clang - there it is.

54
00:03:29,991 --> 00:03:34,750
A baby. I think she's in shock,
I think they all are.

55
00:03:34,751 --> 00:03:36,350
Hello, Celia!

56
00:03:36,351 --> 00:03:38,430
Oh. I thought he'd moved out.

57
00:03:38,431 --> 00:03:41,030
No! Not entirely, not yet.

58
00:03:41,031 --> 00:03:42,790
It hasn't even got a name.

59
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:44,430
They're calling it "The Baby".

60
00:03:44,431 --> 00:03:47,230
And is it... definitely his?

61
00:03:47,231 --> 00:03:49,870
Oh, yeah. First thing Gillian did was
go down to t'chemist

62
00:03:49,871 --> 00:03:52,750
and buy a paternity testing kit.
God.

63
00:03:52,751 --> 00:03:57,190
So... Ellie is living at the farm
with "The Baby".

64
00:03:57,191 --> 00:03:58,750
What does her mother think?

65
00:03:58,751 --> 00:04:00,670
Oh, she wants her back home
and at school.

66
00:04:00,671 --> 00:04:02,590
Only I don't think she's
facing the facts.

67
00:04:02,591 --> 00:04:04,470
She's not prepared to help out.

68
00:04:04,471 --> 00:04:07,870
She has this high-powered
highly-paid job in the NHS

69
00:04:07,871 --> 00:04:10,910
shuffling papers off her desk
onto somebody else's,

70
00:04:10,911 --> 00:04:14,430
which she has made it plain she's not
prepared to give up,

71
00:04:14,431 --> 00:04:17,110
or even go part-time,
and why should she?

72
00:04:17,111 --> 00:04:22,030
But what she's not addressing is
the situation as it stands.

73
00:04:22,031 --> 00:04:26,710
And the husband's no better, he's
a quantity surveyor in Dewsbury.

74
00:04:26,711 --> 00:04:28,070
Divorced.

75
00:04:28,071 --> 00:04:32,230
And he has opinions as well,
but nothing that alters the facts.

76
00:04:32,231 --> 00:04:33,830
So, what's going to happen?

77
00:04:33,831 --> 00:04:37,110
Well, they seem determined to muddle
through at the farm.

78
00:04:37,111 --> 00:04:40,270
Everyone's helping out.
Gillian, Robbie...

79
00:04:40,271 --> 00:04:43,070
How is Gillian?
Harry, me, Alan...

80
00:04:43,071 --> 00:04:46,390
I think I've changed its nappy
as often as anyone.

81
00:04:46,391 --> 00:04:48,470
I mean, they do nowt, Raff and Ellie.

82
00:04:48,471 --> 00:04:50,310
Is she still seeing Robbie? Gillian.

83
00:04:50,311 --> 00:04:52,430
I think they're frightened of it,

84
00:04:52,431 --> 00:04:55,390
and it's a sweet enough
little thing.

85
00:04:55,391 --> 00:04:59,990
It sickens me, when there's folks
want babies and can't,

86
00:04:59,991 --> 00:05:03,790
you know, honest, hard-working,
decent people...

87
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:07,270
Has it... she really not got a
name?

88
00:05:07,271 --> 00:05:11,830
Well, nothing that's stuck.
Gillian calls her Flossie,

89
00:05:11,831 --> 00:05:15,470
which to me is more what you might
call a King Charles Spaniel.

90
00:05:15,471 --> 00:05:17,510
Alan calls her Emily Jane,

91
00:05:17,511 --> 00:05:21,230
but that's just so he can make it
rhyme with stuff.

92
00:05:21,231 --> 00:05:25,830
Harry calls her
Foo-Foo Tinkerbell or summat.

93
00:05:25,831 --> 00:05:27,910
But he's an... idiot.

94
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:29,870
But she's coping? Gillian.

95
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:32,470
What would you call a baby?
If you had one?

96
00:05:32,471 --> 00:05:35,670
Oh, well, for a girl, I've always
liked Emily.

97
00:05:35,671 --> 00:05:37,750
And with Alan. It's good, it's...

98
00:05:37,751 --> 00:05:40,550
Or Victoria, Virginia, Elizabeth,
Charlotte.

99
00:05:40,551 --> 00:05:45,470
Those sort of more traditional
names... Helen, Helena, Eleanor.

100
00:05:45,471 --> 00:05:49,310
Oh, no, that's Ellie. Or... or
something pretty. Like Flora.

101
00:05:49,311 --> 00:05:53,350
Jasmine. Poppy! Grace. That's nice.

102
00:05:53,351 --> 00:05:55,590
Celia! You've got a lovely name.

103
00:05:55,591 --> 00:05:59,510
And there's Rose, Rosie, Ros,
Rosamund, Rosalind...

104
00:05:59,511 --> 00:06:02,230
Florence, Maisie, Daisy...

105
00:06:02,231 --> 00:06:04,550
retro, I know, but it's very sweet.
I don't know!

106
00:06:04,551 --> 00:06:06,671
It'll all depend on what
Caroline thinks.

107
00:06:08,671 --> 00:06:11,310
What would?
What's it got to do with Caroline?

108
00:06:11,311 --> 00:06:13,790
I mean, if ever... if, if... me and
Caroline...

109
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:17,110
Which, why would we?
..had to choose a baby name.

110
00:06:17,111 --> 00:06:18,750
You and Caroline?
You and Caroline?

111
00:06:18,751 --> 00:06:20,271
Not, not, not that...

112
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:24,630
Well, you wouldn't have to.
Would you?

113
00:06:24,631 --> 00:06:26,950
Well, no, women... lesb...

114
00:06:26,951 --> 00:06:30,070
Ladies... do have babies.

115
00:06:30,071 --> 00:06:31,271
Do they?

116
00:06:32,831 --> 00:06:34,590
How.

117
00:06:34,591 --> 00:06:36,191
Well, if...

118
00:06:38,271 --> 00:06:41,510
You're not, are you? She's too old.

119
00:06:41,511 --> 00:06:45,190
Yeah, well, she isn't,
technically, and I'm not.

120
00:06:45,191 --> 00:06:47,710
So, hypothetically, in theory...

121
00:06:47,711 --> 00:06:51,390
She'd not want to go through
all that again at her age.

122
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:53,031
No... no.

123
00:06:58,431 --> 00:07:00,270
Where did you say she was?

124
00:07:00,271 --> 00:07:03,910
The year-12s are doing
King Lear tonight. So...

125
00:07:03,911 --> 00:07:06,430
That'll be one to
slit your wrists to.

126
00:07:06,431 --> 00:07:09,950
So, is that is that something
you're serious about?

127
00:07:09,951 --> 00:07:13,070
No. God, no. Is Alan next door?

128
00:07:13,071 --> 00:07:14,750
No, I've left him in Halifax.

129
00:07:14,751 --> 00:07:17,750
I just popped over to
get a few bits.

130
00:07:17,751 --> 00:07:21,310
Well... and I wanted five minutes
with Caroline.

131
00:07:21,311 --> 00:07:24,230
Any road, will you tell her to pop
round when she's got a minute?

132
00:07:24,231 --> 00:07:26,430
Sure. I mean, not tonight.

133
00:07:26,431 --> 00:07:30,151
If she's had to sit through King Lear
she'll just want to lie down.

134
00:07:39,991 --> 00:07:41,231
There.

135
00:07:53,071 --> 00:07:54,550
Hello.

136
00:07:54,551 --> 00:07:56,190
Gillian. It's John.

137
00:07:56,191 --> 00:07:57,231
Yeah.

138
00:07:58,231 --> 00:08:00,830
Sorry. Erm.
I never rang you back last week

139
00:08:00,831 --> 00:08:04,070
cos I heard what had happened
and I didn't want to pester you.

140
00:08:04,071 --> 00:08:05,910
Sounds like you've
had your hands full.

141
00:08:05,911 --> 00:08:07,310
Yep.

142
00:08:07,311 --> 00:08:09,791
How's... how's... how are things?

143
00:08:11,471 --> 00:08:12,870
Complicated.

144
00:08:12,871 --> 00:08:15,710
Right. I was serious
about what I said.

145
00:08:15,711 --> 00:08:18,870
About putting money... in my farm?

146
00:08:18,871 --> 00:08:21,550
I would do that, but I meant
more about you.

147
00:08:21,551 --> 00:08:24,070
You know, I can't help
thinking it's a mistake.

148
00:08:24,071 --> 00:08:25,910
Right.

149
00:08:25,911 --> 00:08:29,310
I still think about you
all the time.

150
00:08:29,311 --> 00:08:31,950
I've started writing again.
John, I...

151
00:08:31,951 --> 00:08:34,270
I wonder if getting the push
from the publisher was

152
00:08:34,271 --> 00:08:36,191
the kick up the arse that I needed.

153
00:08:38,031 --> 00:08:39,590
It's about you.

154
00:08:39,591 --> 00:08:42,190
Well, sort of about you.

155
00:08:42,191 --> 00:08:45,190
It's about everything.
Everything that's happened.

156
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:48,910
Celia and your dad meeting up again
after all this time.

157
00:08:48,911 --> 00:08:53,630
And... mad bitch here,
and her mousey little girlfriend.

158
00:08:53,631 --> 00:08:57,750
But your character's
the real central... the...

159
00:08:57,751 --> 00:09:01,470
..point of it all really.
The lynch pin.

160
00:09:01,471 --> 00:09:04,510
The... well, the heroine...

161
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:08,870
..if you like. Gillian?

162
00:09:08,871 --> 00:09:11,550
Right. OK.

163
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:14,710
So, you see... it would
be lovely to meet up.

164
00:09:14,711 --> 00:09:17,190
I don't have to come to the house.
The farm.

165
00:09:17,191 --> 00:09:21,150
If that's complicated.
We could just... go out for dinner.

166
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:22,551
Or a drink.

167
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:25,231
Hello?

168
00:09:26,231 --> 00:09:28,310
I can't. It's too messy.

169
00:09:28,311 --> 00:09:29,950
I have to go now.

170
00:09:29,951 --> 00:09:34,390
Gillian... I'm sorry, I'm hanging
up. I'm glad you're working again.

171
00:09:34,391 --> 00:09:37,111
Bye... bye. Bye-bye.

172
00:09:46,271 --> 00:09:48,310
How was school?

173
00:09:48,311 --> 00:09:50,350
Fine.

174
00:09:50,351 --> 00:09:51,710
She been all right?

175
00:09:51,711 --> 00:09:53,510
No, we sold her to a Chinaman.

176
00:09:53,511 --> 00:09:54,990
Right.

177
00:09:54,991 --> 00:09:57,151
We didn't get much for her.

178
00:09:58,191 --> 00:10:00,030
Have you had something to eat?

179
00:10:00,031 --> 00:10:01,590
Toast.

180
00:10:01,591 --> 00:10:03,310
Toast.

181
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:05,310
Are you managing to concentrate?

182
00:10:05,311 --> 00:10:07,310
Yeah.
I mean, at school.

183
00:10:07,311 --> 00:10:09,150
Yes!

184
00:10:09,151 --> 00:10:11,151
She needs her nappy changed.

185
00:10:14,351 --> 00:10:17,111
Little Nelly needs her nappy changed,
kids.

186
00:10:23,671 --> 00:10:25,710
I said,
the baby needs its nappy changed.

187
00:10:25,711 --> 00:10:27,470
Grandad! What y' doing?
Ooh, knackers!

188
00:10:27,471 --> 00:10:30,070
Were you saving the universe?
Y'shouldn't have done that.

189
00:10:30,071 --> 00:10:32,750
It's not real. Me and your grandad
lived through the Blitz.

190
00:10:32,751 --> 00:10:34,790
Did you 'eck.
Blitz was in t'big cities.

191
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:37,670
Halifax got one bomb dropped on it,
and that were by accident

192
00:10:37,671 --> 00:10:40,230
cos some plank in the Luftwaffe
couldn't find Manchester.

193
00:10:40,231 --> 00:10:41,710
Oh, they know it all don't they?

194
00:10:41,711 --> 00:10:44,750
Except, oh, yeah,
how to avoid getting pregnant.

195
00:10:44,751 --> 00:10:47,030
We wouldn't have made that mistake,
would we, Alan?

196
00:10:47,031 --> 00:10:48,591
Eh? Blitz or no Blitz...

197
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:08,831
It's me.

198
00:11:10,991 --> 00:11:13,230
Can I come in.

199
00:11:13,231 --> 00:11:15,351
Why are you even friends with him?

200
00:11:20,671 --> 00:11:22,951
It isn't really about him, is it?

201
00:11:44,351 --> 00:11:46,191
I've got to earn some money,
grandad.

202
00:11:47,591 --> 00:11:50,551
Going to school now,
it's just ridiculous

203
00:12:01,871 --> 00:12:04,670
I told him,
he can get a job soon enough,

204
00:12:04,671 --> 00:12:07,431
but I'd be sickened
if he left school, Celia.

205
00:12:09,431 --> 00:12:11,830
Celia?
So, there's no point us looking

206
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:14,270
for a little bungalow now then,
is there?

207
00:12:14,271 --> 00:12:16,230
Well, we can look, but,

208
00:12:16,231 --> 00:12:19,550
you see, when I was his age,
well, you an' all,

209
00:12:19,551 --> 00:12:21,230
it were never an option.

210
00:12:21,231 --> 00:12:24,190
Were it? Staying on at school.

211
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:27,030
If he'd just get his A levels,

212
00:12:27,031 --> 00:12:30,590
he'd always be able to try
for a university at a later stage.

213
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:34,550
Wouldn't he? Which...
well, that's important.

214
00:12:34,551 --> 00:12:38,550
Trouble is, he wants to do the
right thing, which I understand,

215
00:12:38,551 --> 00:12:42,150
but t'difficulty is,
knowing what the right thing is

216
00:12:42,151 --> 00:12:45,270
when everybody seems to have
so many different opinions.

217
00:12:45,271 --> 00:12:48,790
Yeah. I think somebody at school's
said something nasty

218
00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:50,990
that's upset him.

219
00:12:50,991 --> 00:12:53,470
Well, they will do, they're kids.

220
00:12:53,471 --> 00:12:56,190
I don't want him ending up in
a job wi' no prospects,

221
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:59,230
and then for her to just up-sticks
and beggar off anyway

222
00:12:59,231 --> 00:13:01,310
with the baby, which you never know.

223
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:05,510
I mean, I don't know whether they're
still actually seeing one another.

224
00:13:05,511 --> 00:13:07,990
I don't even know that they
ever were

225
00:13:07,991 --> 00:13:11,911
beyond this one evening
of Malibu-fuelled passion.

226
00:13:13,191 --> 00:13:16,310
I know he was smitten with her
before, but

227
00:13:16,311 --> 00:13:19,790
I'm not so sure now and
she doesn't seem bothered about

228
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:22,950
owt much at the minute,
him included.

229
00:13:22,951 --> 00:13:25,430
You're not telling me
anything I don't know.

230
00:13:25,431 --> 00:13:27,310
I have been there a week.

231
00:13:27,311 --> 00:13:31,670
I know, I'm just... I'm struggling
to make sense of it myself.

232
00:13:31,671 --> 00:13:35,430
The more I think about it,
worse it seems to get.

233
00:13:35,431 --> 00:13:39,390
It's a mess, Celia.
It's a right bloody mess.

234
00:13:39,391 --> 00:13:42,830
Yeah,
but you haven't to get stressed.

235
00:13:42,831 --> 00:13:45,191
Oh... I'm all right.

236
00:13:46,871 --> 00:13:49,350
I'm missing you.

237
00:13:49,351 --> 00:13:50,830
I'm missing you.

238
00:13:50,831 --> 00:13:54,550
Oh, hey up. Madame Lazonga's back.

239
00:13:54,551 --> 00:13:56,951
Who?
Our little Caroline.

240
00:13:58,191 --> 00:14:00,470
Hey,
what do you think about Cordelia?

241
00:14:00,471 --> 00:14:03,990
For a name. It's King Lear.
There's three of them.

242
00:14:03,991 --> 00:14:07,830
Daughters - Goneril, Regan
and Cordelia.

243
00:14:07,831 --> 00:14:10,270
I think of the three...

244
00:14:10,271 --> 00:14:15,110
Goneril!
Oh, y'just wouldn't, would you?

245
00:14:15,111 --> 00:14:17,750
There's no wonder
they wanted him dead.

246
00:14:17,751 --> 00:14:19,991
Dozy old bugger.

247
00:14:49,391 --> 00:14:50,671
Kate?

248
00:14:53,111 --> 00:14:54,431
Are you all right?

249
00:14:56,151 --> 00:14:57,591
How was King Lear?

250
00:14:58,871 --> 00:15:01,870
It was very good,
I was very proud of them.

251
00:15:01,871 --> 00:15:04,870
Your mum's back.
I saw the car.

252
00:15:04,871 --> 00:15:06,871
She said to pop round. Not tonight.

253
00:15:08,111 --> 00:15:10,310
Have you been crying?

254
00:15:10,311 --> 00:15:13,030
Just feeling sorry for myself.

255
00:15:13,031 --> 00:15:15,390
Why?

256
00:15:15,391 --> 00:15:18,150
Not Lawrence. No.

257
00:15:18,151 --> 00:15:20,950
John? No!

258
00:15:20,951 --> 00:15:22,791
My mother? No.

259
00:15:24,391 --> 00:15:25,631
What then?

260
00:15:36,871 --> 00:15:38,951
Do you want to tell me
about it in bed?

261
00:15:44,271 --> 00:15:46,271
Have you been eating peanuts?

262
00:15:47,351 --> 00:15:49,950
Popcorn at the interval...
That'd do it.

263
00:15:49,951 --> 00:15:52,110
..but I've drunk a whole glass of
wine since then!

264
00:15:52,111 --> 00:15:54,391
That'd wash off any...
Not necessarily. Get the...

265
00:15:55,711 --> 00:15:59,430
Where's your handbag?
In there.

266
00:15:59,431 --> 00:16:01,470
Do you want me to do it?
Do you want to do it?

267
00:16:01,471 --> 00:16:03,111
No, you.

268
00:16:08,311 --> 00:16:11,110
Here, just right there.

269
00:16:11,111 --> 00:16:15,471
You're going to be fine.
I'm going to be fine.

270
00:16:18,191 --> 00:16:19,431
Ambulance.

271
00:16:21,231 --> 00:16:23,750
Caroline Elliot,
46 Conway Drive,

272
00:16:23,751 --> 00:16:26,231
Harrogate, HG3 2MC.

273
00:16:27,911 --> 00:16:29,991
I've got someone with anaphylaxia.

274
00:16:31,831 --> 00:16:33,510
Thank you.

275
00:16:33,511 --> 00:16:36,550
Four minutes. God, I'm sorry.

276
00:16:36,551 --> 00:16:37,870
I'm fine.

277
00:16:37,871 --> 00:16:39,390
Stupid thing to do!

278
00:16:39,391 --> 00:16:40,910
I don't think I need an ambulance.

279
00:16:40,911 --> 00:16:42,431
It's on its way, it's coming.

280
00:16:43,351 --> 00:16:45,710
Y'have to massage it after
you've injected.

281
00:16:45,711 --> 00:16:46,991
Let me.

282
00:16:49,951 --> 00:16:51,710
What were you upset about?

283
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:53,071
Just.

284
00:16:54,551 --> 00:16:55,831
Babies.

285
00:17:05,711 --> 00:17:07,591
Kate's just had, erm...

286
00:17:10,391 --> 00:17:11,991
I wasn't, uh...

287
00:17:14,351 --> 00:17:15,551
We weren't...

288
00:17:29,591 --> 00:17:32,150
You want to get yourself to
bed,

289
00:17:32,151 --> 00:17:34,150
you've got school tomorrow.

290
00:17:34,151 --> 00:17:36,271
I might sleep down here tonight.

291
00:17:38,191 --> 00:17:40,270
Why?

292
00:17:40,271 --> 00:17:43,151
Just...
that camp bed's not right comfy.

293
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:48,310
We should get you a double bed.

294
00:17:48,311 --> 00:17:50,590
Would a double bed fit in that room?
With a cot.

295
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:51,950
When we get the cot.

296
00:17:51,951 --> 00:17:54,350
I'm fine sleeping down here.

297
00:17:54,351 --> 00:17:57,430
What about when little doo-dah needs
feeding during the night?

298
00:17:57,431 --> 00:17:59,270
You can't leave it all to Ellie.

299
00:17:59,271 --> 00:18:01,350
I'll hear her, I'll help her.

300
00:18:01,351 --> 00:18:02,990
You mightn't.

301
00:18:02,991 --> 00:18:04,951
I just, don't want to crowd her.

302
00:18:06,271 --> 00:18:07,630
Who?

303
00:18:07,631 --> 00:18:08,831
Ellie.

304
00:18:13,031 --> 00:18:14,591
We need another bedroom.

305
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:20,150
I'll get you that other duvet...

306
00:18:20,151 --> 00:18:21,751
out of the airing cupboard.

307
00:18:39,031 --> 00:18:40,790
Hospital?

308
00:18:40,791 --> 00:18:43,910
She'll be fine, it happens.

309
00:18:43,911 --> 00:18:46,670
I've given her the morning off work,
anyway.

310
00:18:46,671 --> 00:18:49,750
Oh, hell, steady on.
You don't want to be spoiling her.

311
00:18:49,751 --> 00:18:52,750
Are you just here to dazzle us
all with your sparkling wit

312
00:18:52,751 --> 00:18:53,870
or do you want something?

313
00:18:53,871 --> 00:18:55,270
I haven't see you for a week!

314
00:18:55,271 --> 00:18:56,550
Have I changed?

315
00:18:56,551 --> 00:18:58,870
No, you're just as gorgeous.

316
00:18:58,871 --> 00:19:01,350
Mm. So are you.

317
00:19:01,351 --> 00:19:04,150
She said something droll yesterday,
did Kate.

318
00:19:04,151 --> 00:19:07,070
Oh, what. We were discussing
babies' names, you know,

319
00:19:07,071 --> 00:19:12,030
for little Fanny Alice
and... she talked like...

320
00:19:12,031 --> 00:19:16,111
..you were thinking of having one.
You and her. I said "How?"

321
00:19:17,831 --> 00:19:19,870
Oh, she, we... it's, it's not...

322
00:19:19,871 --> 00:19:21,830
Where's my laptop? And my papers?
Sorry?

323
00:19:21,831 --> 00:19:25,670
They were on the coffee table
in the sitting room. They were right
there in front of me.

324
00:19:25,671 --> 00:19:29,510
Have you been buggering around in
there? It wasn't him, it was me.
I've confiscated them.

325
00:19:29,511 --> 00:19:32,150
Where are they? I'm not telling you.
Where ARE they?

326
00:19:32,151 --> 00:19:34,510
Why don't you talk to me
about Alison Waterhouse?

327
00:19:34,511 --> 00:19:37,630
Who? "A flaccid, overripe fruit of
a woman."

328
00:19:37,631 --> 00:19:40,670
I was experimenting with...
language, similes.

329
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:42,070
It's a metaphor.

330
00:19:42,071 --> 00:19:45,110
It's a lazy metaphor, I mean, what
sort of fruit are we talking about?

331
00:19:45,111 --> 00:19:46,590
A banana? A tangerine?

332
00:19:46,591 --> 00:19:49,310
You know, people always think you've
based characters on them

333
00:19:49,311 --> 00:19:50,790
and you haven't.

334
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:54,150
And can we leave Alison's
"dusky Negress" right out of it?

335
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:57,310
Or Matthew Waterhouse will be
getting his withering, shrivelling,

336
00:19:57,311 --> 00:20:00,230
starved-of-light, pink little
bollocks chopped right off.

337
00:20:00,231 --> 00:20:01,390
Right. Fine.

338
00:20:01,391 --> 00:20:02,990
Is that what he's put?

339
00:20:02,991 --> 00:20:05,510
Adjustments will be made.
Can I have it back?

340
00:20:05,511 --> 00:20:07,350
No. You can whistle.
Caroline!

341
00:20:07,351 --> 00:20:10,990
And what about Lizzie Cunningham?
Hmm?

342
00:20:10,991 --> 00:20:13,510
"A latter-day Bathsheba Everdene"
no less,

343
00:20:13,511 --> 00:20:14,790
who owns her own sheep farm

344
00:20:14,791 --> 00:20:17,310
and has more suitors than
she knows what to do with.

345
00:20:17,311 --> 00:20:18,750
Who does that remind us of?

346
00:20:18,751 --> 00:20:21,230
"A sullen, sinewy 40-something
woman

347
00:20:21,231 --> 00:20:24,830
"with the purposeful frame and
carriage of a 16-year-old boy".

348
00:20:24,831 --> 00:20:27,190
Ooh, la-la! So...

349
00:20:27,191 --> 00:20:30,150
Mummy isn't the only
gay in the village.

350
00:20:30,151 --> 00:20:32,910
I'm sorry, I am sorry, I'm going
to have to ring Gillian...

351
00:20:32,911 --> 00:20:34,510
You are not going to ring Gillian.

352
00:20:34,511 --> 00:20:37,510
I am. I'm going to have to
ring Gillian.

353
00:20:37,511 --> 00:20:39,070
You are not ringing Gillian!

354
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:43,031
Right!
Ring bloody sodding Gillian then!

355
00:20:44,351 --> 00:20:47,230
Do you mind not using language like
that in front of my mother?

356
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:48,671
Give it me back.

357
00:20:50,831 --> 00:20:51,990
CAROLINE!?!

358
00:20:51,991 --> 00:20:53,430
What's he put about me?

359
00:20:53,431 --> 00:20:55,230
It's not you...

360
00:20:55,231 --> 00:20:59,030
The basic upshot is two people
in their 70s, in love,

361
00:20:59,031 --> 00:21:01,950
who get together after...
ooh, 60 years?

362
00:21:01,951 --> 00:21:04,790
But it's not about you, and then
their respective daughters -

363
00:21:04,791 --> 00:21:07,710
Alison, the flaccid, overripe
fruit, who just happens to be

364
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:11,190
the headmistress of a very
marvellous public school,

365
00:21:11,191 --> 00:21:15,190
and Lizzie, with the body of a
16-year-old boy, and a sheep farm.

366
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:16,830
I want to read it.

367
00:21:16,831 --> 00:21:19,150
I've not written the
bloody thing yet!

368
00:21:19,151 --> 00:21:22,670
No, and I don't think you should if
you're going to be rude about people.

369
00:21:22,671 --> 00:21:24,230
Why were you even reading it anyway?

370
00:21:24,231 --> 00:21:26,390
Cos you shouldn't leave
things chucking about.

371
00:21:26,391 --> 00:21:28,430
If this is damaged,
you're paying for a new one.

372
00:21:28,431 --> 00:21:29,871
Oh, that's happening.

373
00:21:32,951 --> 00:21:34,590
Why is he even here?

374
00:21:34,591 --> 00:21:37,790
Because he's got nowhere else to go.

375
00:21:37,791 --> 00:21:41,310
He reckons to be looking for a flat
to rent near the university

376
00:21:41,311 --> 00:21:43,790
till I can buy him out here,
and then he can buy somewhere.

377
00:21:43,791 --> 00:21:45,430
I don't know.

378
00:21:45,431 --> 00:21:47,710
Have you made any decisions yet?

379
00:21:47,711 --> 00:21:50,391
It's all up in the air,
I'm afraid, love.

380
00:21:51,911 --> 00:21:53,511
Go brush your teeth.

381
00:22:01,991 --> 00:22:03,991
You know, Kate's up for it.

382
00:22:05,151 --> 00:22:09,070
She's serious, she's had her house
valued, she's got it on the market.

383
00:22:09,071 --> 00:22:12,151
OK. But she, erm...

384
00:22:14,231 --> 00:22:16,431
OK. So, the thing is...

385
00:22:18,031 --> 00:22:19,750
It's true. She does want a baby.

386
00:22:19,751 --> 00:22:22,550
If she makes this commitment to me,
to me buying the house,

387
00:22:22,551 --> 00:22:24,550
she wants us to...

388
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:25,710
How?

389
00:22:25,711 --> 00:22:27,870
Oh, don't worry about that.
But the thing is...

390
00:22:27,871 --> 00:22:30,390
Would you really want to go
through all that again?

391
00:22:30,391 --> 00:22:34,630
No. It's unlikely that she'll
ever get pregnant.

392
00:22:34,631 --> 00:22:37,350
She was pregnant four times
when she was married to Richard,

393
00:22:37,351 --> 00:22:39,870
but she never got beyond the first
12 weeks.

394
00:22:39,871 --> 00:22:41,950
She's 42,
I've been on the internet,

395
00:22:41,951 --> 00:22:44,950
the chances of her getting
pregnant are minute.

396
00:22:44,951 --> 00:22:47,710
And I think she'd be better
concentrating on her career,

397
00:22:47,711 --> 00:22:49,830
she's very clever, but,
the thing is...

398
00:22:49,831 --> 00:22:51,990
Sorry, you don't want to hear
this.

399
00:22:51,991 --> 00:22:54,590
Oh, go on. It's her birthday this
coming weekend,

400
00:22:54,591 --> 00:22:56,550
so I'm going to take
her... somewhere nice,

401
00:22:56,551 --> 00:22:59,910
it's a little hotel I've found, and
I've booked it, and I'm going to...

402
00:22:59,911 --> 00:23:02,831
to try and talk her out of it.
For her sake!

403
00:23:03,951 --> 00:23:08,070
She'll only end up tearful and
disappointed when it doesn't happen.

404
00:23:08,071 --> 00:23:10,390
I wondered
if you'd keep an eye on the boys?

405
00:23:10,391 --> 00:23:11,830
You and Alan.

406
00:23:11,831 --> 00:23:14,630
There's no point asking John,
he'll just get Judith round again

407
00:23:14,631 --> 00:23:17,231
and trash the place.
Yeah, of course we will, love.

408
00:23:18,551 --> 00:23:19,831
Thank you.

409
00:23:24,351 --> 00:23:26,790
What are your plans today?

410
00:23:26,791 --> 00:23:29,871
Oh, we're going looking at a
bungalow! Over at Ripponden.

411
00:23:30,911 --> 00:23:33,711
You needn't look so worried,
we're only looking.

412
00:23:49,031 --> 00:23:51,151
Good morning. Mrs Buttershaw?

413
00:23:53,511 --> 00:23:56,230
How do you do.
You have picked a super day.

414
00:23:56,231 --> 00:23:57,910
It's a smashing view.

415
00:23:57,911 --> 00:23:59,990
Well, it's all in with the price.

416
00:23:59,991 --> 00:24:03,110
And this is my husband.
And that's the baby.

417
00:24:03,111 --> 00:24:05,510
We've not been married a week,
and look.

418
00:24:05,511 --> 00:24:08,710
You can't hang about, y'see,
not when you get to our age.

419
00:24:08,711 --> 00:24:10,110
Right.

420
00:24:10,111 --> 00:24:14,470
He's pulling your leg, love. We're
actually the great grandparents.

421
00:24:14,471 --> 00:24:18,230
I know! And me only 36.
Have you remembered the keys?

422
00:24:18,231 --> 00:24:20,150
Yeah.

423
00:24:20,151 --> 00:24:22,870
Boo! Boo! Yes!

424
00:24:22,871 --> 00:24:24,831
Do you like it?

425
00:24:27,071 --> 00:24:30,070
What do you reckon?
Oh, it's beautiful.

426
00:24:30,071 --> 00:24:32,350
And we can afford it. Between us.

427
00:24:32,351 --> 00:24:33,591
In theory.

428
00:24:34,751 --> 00:24:36,590
I know.

429
00:24:36,591 --> 00:24:39,750
It wouldn't need a lot doing.
Maybe a new bathroom,

430
00:24:39,751 --> 00:24:43,271
but other than that.
That kitchen's beautiful.

431
00:24:44,951 --> 00:24:49,231
We need to win t'lottery,
then we'd have enough for everybody.

432
00:24:51,271 --> 00:24:52,871
Are we kidding ourselves?

433
00:24:54,231 --> 00:24:56,671
I think so, don't you?

434
00:24:57,951 --> 00:24:59,911
Way things are at the moment.

435
00:25:02,391 --> 00:25:05,670
It's her mother and father that ought
to be forking out for stuff,

436
00:25:05,671 --> 00:25:07,310
not you and Gillian.

437
00:25:07,311 --> 00:25:10,430
You're giving her and the baby
a roof over their heads,

438
00:25:10,431 --> 00:25:13,230
least they can do is
put their hands in their pockets.

439
00:25:13,231 --> 00:25:15,950
Aye, but we can't make 'em, can we?

440
00:25:15,951 --> 00:25:20,030
You know your little house,
up Barkisland. Yeah.

441
00:25:20,031 --> 00:25:22,110
Have y'ever thought of getting
it valued,

442
00:25:22,111 --> 00:25:25,830
and then asking Darren and Kimberley
if they'd like to buy it?

443
00:25:25,831 --> 00:25:28,110
Then you'd not be turfing them out.

444
00:25:28,111 --> 00:25:31,630
No. No, I hadn't thought of that.

445
00:25:31,631 --> 00:25:33,990
Is it something you'd consider?

446
00:25:33,991 --> 00:25:37,110
In theory. In practice I doubt it's
something they could afford to do.

447
00:25:37,111 --> 00:25:38,351
Well, you don't know.

448
00:25:39,791 --> 00:25:43,790
They might have parents that'd
like to try to help them along.

449
00:25:43,791 --> 00:25:46,390
I can ask. But what'd be t'point?

450
00:25:46,391 --> 00:25:50,391
If you're thinking of investing
more money in Caroline's house?

451
00:25:51,711 --> 00:25:55,710
You realise the alternative
is you and me forever flitting

452
00:25:55,711 --> 00:25:57,871
between Harrogate and Halifax.

453
00:25:59,111 --> 00:26:02,590
Wouldn't it be nice to have
somewhere of our own?

454
00:26:02,591 --> 00:26:04,430
Well, it would, but...

455
00:26:04,431 --> 00:26:07,710
I think you should tell Darren
and Kimberley that

456
00:26:07,711 --> 00:26:11,590
your circumstances've changed, and
you need the capital

457
00:26:11,591 --> 00:26:14,910
out of that house, whether they can
afford to buy it or not.

458
00:26:14,911 --> 00:26:16,111
Do you?

459
00:26:17,831 --> 00:26:20,230
What's so funny?

460
00:26:20,231 --> 00:26:22,270
You like home truths, don't you?

461
00:26:22,271 --> 00:26:24,870
Now and again.
You like to call a spade a spade.

462
00:26:24,871 --> 00:26:26,990
Yes, I do.

463
00:26:26,991 --> 00:26:28,950
And here's some more...

464
00:26:28,951 --> 00:26:31,550
I know you think Raff should
stop on at school,

465
00:26:31,551 --> 00:26:33,790
and I do understand why.

466
00:26:33,791 --> 00:26:37,070
But the fact is,
he's muckied his ticket.

467
00:26:37,071 --> 00:26:39,750
And if you don't let him
take responsibility for it,

468
00:26:39,751 --> 00:26:41,310
he'll never grow up.

469
00:26:41,311 --> 00:26:43,110
Is that right?
You know it is.

470
00:26:43,111 --> 00:26:44,710
Do you know what I think?

471
00:26:44,711 --> 00:26:46,110
Fire away.

472
00:26:46,111 --> 00:26:50,270
I think you ought to tell Caroline
to paddle her own canoe,

473
00:26:50,271 --> 00:26:52,670
and cut her coat according
to her cloth.

474
00:26:52,671 --> 00:26:54,670
Nobody needs a house that big.

475
00:26:54,671 --> 00:26:56,630
There's only four of 'em,

476
00:26:56,631 --> 00:26:59,790
and William'll be off to
university at the end of the summer.

477
00:26:59,791 --> 00:27:02,550
He'll be back in the holidays.
Oh come on, Celia!

478
00:27:02,551 --> 00:27:06,790
Her and Kate between 'em,
they must earn a six figure salary.

479
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:08,550
Well, I've no idea.

480
00:27:08,551 --> 00:27:11,870
Easily. Caroline probably
earns that on her own.

481
00:27:11,871 --> 00:27:15,910
Why should she expect
money from you as well?

482
00:27:15,911 --> 00:27:19,310
Caroline was very good to me
after Kenneth died.

483
00:27:19,311 --> 00:27:21,110
I'm sure she were, but now,

484
00:27:21,111 --> 00:27:24,910
eight years on,
your circumstances have changed.

485
00:27:24,911 --> 00:27:26,550
She should sell that house

486
00:27:26,551 --> 00:27:30,871
and find somewhere just as lovely
only happen a bit smaller.

487
00:27:36,191 --> 00:27:39,150
You do realise if you keep taking
that baby out so much,

488
00:27:39,151 --> 00:27:43,191
it's going to get very
confused about who its mother is.

489
00:27:44,351 --> 00:27:45,991
I'm serious!

490
00:27:55,911 --> 00:27:57,910
What time will Gillian be home?

491
00:27:57,911 --> 00:28:00,110
She's on t'late shift down at
Greenhough's.

492
00:28:00,111 --> 00:28:02,910
They close at eight,
she's generally back by 20 past.

493
00:28:02,911 --> 00:28:04,550
Is there anything I can be doing?

494
00:28:04,551 --> 00:28:05,711
No, you're all right love.

495
00:28:08,751 --> 00:28:11,190
It had a grand big sitting room.

496
00:28:11,191 --> 00:28:13,750
They're very sought-after
properties them up there.

497
00:28:13,751 --> 00:28:16,430
Are they? Oh, aye. It'd be a good
investment, if nowt else.

498
00:28:16,431 --> 00:28:19,550
It won't hang around, even wi'
t'property market like it is.

499
00:28:19,551 --> 00:28:24,190
I do like round here.
I suppose it feels like coming home.

500
00:28:24,191 --> 00:28:26,230
Well, it is, isn't it?

501
00:28:26,231 --> 00:28:29,510
Nearly.
Elland was our stomping ground.

502
00:28:29,511 --> 00:28:31,110
What's Alan think?

503
00:28:31,111 --> 00:28:34,950
Oh, he was just as taken
with it as I was.

504
00:28:34,951 --> 00:28:38,430
Are they all right now?
Gillian and Alan?

505
00:28:38,431 --> 00:28:42,310
Gillian and Alan? Yeah, I think so.

506
00:28:42,311 --> 00:28:44,870
Cos you know she were really upset.

507
00:28:44,871 --> 00:28:48,230
Oh, she was just bothered cos we
got married without telling anyone.

508
00:28:48,231 --> 00:28:49,750
No, I mean before.

509
00:28:49,751 --> 00:28:52,590
That whole two weeks
when you were over in Harrogate,

510
00:28:52,591 --> 00:28:54,750
there were summat up.

511
00:28:54,751 --> 00:28:58,710
Oh... something about Eileen.
Her mother.

512
00:28:58,711 --> 00:29:01,071
Something about being disappointed...

513
00:29:02,671 --> 00:29:04,471
Oh, I know what it was.

514
00:29:05,791 --> 00:29:09,550
Gillian had an abortion, apparently,
when she was 15.

515
00:29:09,551 --> 00:29:13,750
She had to leave school and, oh, it
all got brought up again,

516
00:29:13,751 --> 00:29:16,190
and it all
seemed to be about that,

517
00:29:16,191 --> 00:29:18,070
but don't say anything love.

518
00:29:18,071 --> 00:29:20,670
I assume Raff doesn't know.

519
00:29:20,671 --> 00:29:22,710
And what upset Gillian

520
00:29:22,711 --> 00:29:26,271
was Alan saying how
disappointed her mother was.

521
00:29:27,471 --> 00:29:31,751
That's all, it's all water under
t'bridge now, so.

522
00:29:33,471 --> 00:29:35,151
I spoke to Greg.

523
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:38,150
You spoke to him? How?

524
00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:41,510
He rang this afternoon.
Just before you got back from work.

525
00:29:41,511 --> 00:29:43,631
He wants to pop over
for my birthday.

526
00:29:46,111 --> 00:29:47,711
Actually on your birthday?

527
00:29:49,311 --> 00:29:51,111
Well...

528
00:29:52,151 --> 00:29:55,270
OK, but what if I'd made plans
for your birthday?

529
00:29:55,271 --> 00:29:56,990
Have you?

530
00:29:56,991 --> 00:30:00,790
You didn't, you didn't... what...
You didn't talk to him about...?

531
00:30:00,791 --> 00:30:02,950
I mentioned it.
Mentioned it how?

532
00:30:02,951 --> 00:30:05,950
Well, I explained.
What we've discussed, and he said...

533
00:30:05,951 --> 00:30:09,230
yeah, that he'd be more than happy
to help out.

534
00:30:09,231 --> 00:30:11,550
We've not made any, you know,
plans.

535
00:30:11,551 --> 00:30:14,271
Obviously. I said, obviously, you'd
want to meet him first.

536
00:30:16,111 --> 00:30:18,630
I've booked a hotel
for a couple of nights.

537
00:30:18,631 --> 00:30:20,550
Caroline.

538
00:30:20,551 --> 00:30:22,190
Do you want me to cancel it?

539
00:30:22,191 --> 00:30:24,630
No, oh, no...

540
00:30:24,631 --> 00:30:27,271
but I want you to meet him. Soon.

541
00:30:28,911 --> 00:30:32,030
Where is it? The hotel.
You're not suggesting...?

542
00:30:32,031 --> 00:30:35,150
He could just meet us for a drink.
I'm not suggesting that we do the...

543
00:30:35,151 --> 00:30:37,870
No, I'm just suggesting that you
meet him. Get to know him.

544
00:30:37,871 --> 00:30:40,511
I don't need to get to know him.
You need to meet him.

545
00:30:46,911 --> 00:30:49,151
It's a bad idea.
No. It's not. It's...

546
00:30:55,231 --> 00:30:59,510
Fine, ask him for a drink. Maybe
it's better that we meet him there,

547
00:30:59,511 --> 00:31:02,590
rather than here. What's the matter?
What's the matter is that

548
00:31:02,591 --> 00:31:05,590
you're going to get pregnant,
possibly, with someone else, which

549
00:31:05,591 --> 00:31:07,870
is fine in so far as you can't get
pregnant with me,

550
00:31:07,871 --> 00:31:10,510
but beyond that...
It's... less fine.

551
00:31:10,511 --> 00:31:13,430
There are things that I haven't...

552
00:31:13,431 --> 00:31:15,351
processed, yet.

553
00:31:17,471 --> 00:31:20,230
I assume I don't need to
spell them out.

554
00:31:20,231 --> 00:31:22,431
It is the most likely way
for it to work.

555
00:31:24,671 --> 00:31:30,350
You do know that whatever way,
it's kind of unlikely, don't you?

556
00:31:30,351 --> 00:31:35,390
I know the odds aren't great. Yes.
I want to try though, Caroline.

557
00:31:35,391 --> 00:31:37,630
And I'm terrified of leaving it any
longer.

558
00:31:37,631 --> 00:31:39,070
What if it doesn't happen?

559
00:31:39,071 --> 00:31:42,150
I'll deal with it.
You'll get upset. Well...

560
00:31:42,151 --> 00:31:44,870
It's better to try and fail again

561
00:31:44,871 --> 00:31:47,631
before I give up for good,
though, isn't it?

562
00:31:48,991 --> 00:31:50,870
You've got a fantastic career.

563
00:31:50,871 --> 00:31:53,990
You'll be the next head of languages
- you will, no contest -

564
00:31:53,991 --> 00:31:58,110
you could be a deputy head in a few
very short years.

565
00:31:58,111 --> 00:31:59,831
You've got what it takes, Kate.

566
00:32:02,151 --> 00:32:03,911
I want to be somebody's mum.

567
00:32:10,711 --> 00:32:12,471
Do you think we should get married?

568
00:32:16,151 --> 00:32:17,791
Don't be daft.

569
00:32:58,431 --> 00:33:02,470
Hiya!
Casserole for y'all in the oven.

570
00:33:02,471 --> 00:33:03,870
Are you not stopping?

571
00:33:03,871 --> 00:33:06,590
No, I'm...
I've got stuff to do at home.

572
00:33:06,591 --> 00:33:08,830
What's up?

573
00:33:08,831 --> 00:33:10,871
Did you have an abortion
when you were 15?

574
00:33:16,391 --> 00:33:17,631
Was it mine?

575
00:33:19,391 --> 00:33:20,591
Yeah.

576
00:33:22,151 --> 00:33:24,710
Who's...? How's...?

577
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:26,151
Celia.

578
00:33:27,511 --> 00:33:31,310
Celia? Just... chatting. Just asked
her why you and Alan fell out

579
00:33:31,311 --> 00:33:33,190
when he stayed over in Harrogate.

580
00:33:33,191 --> 00:33:35,350
You haven't to think, there was,
I never...

581
00:33:35,351 --> 00:33:36,750
Why did you never tell me?

582
00:33:36,751 --> 00:33:38,231
I was 15.

583
00:33:40,791 --> 00:33:41,991
I'd forgotten.

584
00:33:43,551 --> 00:33:45,710
It'd have been 30-odd now.

585
00:33:45,711 --> 00:33:47,350
31.

586
00:33:47,351 --> 00:33:50,710
I could never have had it.
There were no point telling you.

587
00:33:50,711 --> 00:33:51,951
No.

588
00:33:53,751 --> 00:33:56,231
I'm sorry. No, I'm just...

589
00:33:57,591 --> 00:34:00,270
I just never knew.
I'd been a dad.

590
00:34:00,271 --> 00:34:02,310
You weren't.

591
00:34:02,311 --> 00:34:05,751
And then...
you went off with our Eddie.

592
00:34:07,711 --> 00:34:09,670
I'm not being funny,
but I'm off home.

593
00:34:09,671 --> 00:34:12,670
Right. And are you coming back?

594
00:34:12,671 --> 00:34:14,631
Not tonight.
Will you ring me?

595
00:34:16,791 --> 00:34:18,071
Are you dumping me?

596
00:34:19,231 --> 00:34:21,391
I just don't want to be here.
For a bit.

597
00:34:23,871 --> 00:34:26,630
So, how is this "not being funny"?
Then.

598
00:34:26,631 --> 00:34:30,350
If you're "just going home"?
Are you feeling sorry for yourself?

599
00:34:30,351 --> 00:34:32,390
Cos I was the one that had
to leave school,

600
00:34:32,391 --> 00:34:35,190
I was the one that never got
a crack at their A levels.

601
00:34:35,191 --> 00:34:36,950
And I could've done, I wasn't thick.

602
00:34:36,951 --> 00:34:40,630
I never told you, but I never
inflicted anything on you either.

603
00:34:40,631 --> 00:34:42,470
I'm going home.

604
00:34:42,471 --> 00:34:43,871
Right.

605
00:34:56,711 --> 00:34:59,151
What a bitch.

606
00:35:07,991 --> 00:35:09,590
Is that you, love?

607
00:35:09,591 --> 00:35:11,470
Yeah.

608
00:35:11,471 --> 00:35:12,671
Yeah.

609
00:35:13,751 --> 00:35:16,550
Yeah, it's me.
I fell asleep.

610
00:35:16,551 --> 00:35:18,990
So did I.

611
00:35:18,991 --> 00:35:21,070
Supper's ready. Where's Ellie?

612
00:35:21,071 --> 00:35:22,751
Do you want to give her a shout?

613
00:35:26,711 --> 00:35:28,990
Robbie's gone.
Has he?

614
00:35:28,991 --> 00:35:30,470
Shall I set the table, love?

615
00:35:30,471 --> 00:35:33,870
He's cooked everybody's tea,
and now he's gone.

616
00:35:33,871 --> 00:35:35,830
I didn't know he was here.

617
00:35:35,831 --> 00:35:37,190
You did.

618
00:35:37,191 --> 00:35:38,590
Did I?

619
00:35:38,591 --> 00:35:40,150
Oh, he's been asleep.

620
00:35:40,151 --> 00:35:42,390
He's gone,
and he's not in a very good mood.

621
00:35:42,391 --> 00:35:44,630
Has somebody said something to him?

622
00:35:44,631 --> 00:35:46,430
What about?

623
00:35:46,431 --> 00:35:49,071
Me. How do you mean? Oh. What?

624
00:35:50,311 --> 00:35:56,471
Celia told Robbie that
I had an abortion when I was 15.

625
00:36:00,271 --> 00:36:02,110
Well, the thing is,

626
00:36:02,111 --> 00:36:05,510
he asked me why you
and your dad'd fallen out, so...

627
00:36:05,511 --> 00:36:07,630
It was his. Whose?

628
00:36:07,631 --> 00:36:09,350
Robbie's. Robbie...?

629
00:36:09,351 --> 00:36:12,390
So, and he never knew
and now he does.

630
00:36:12,391 --> 00:36:15,110
So, he's gone. Robbie?

631
00:36:15,111 --> 00:36:18,230
I used to see him
before I started seeing Eddie.

632
00:36:18,231 --> 00:36:20,950
Well, I... I didn't know that.

633
00:36:20,951 --> 00:36:23,550
Why were you telling him
stuff about me anyway?

634
00:36:23,551 --> 00:36:25,631
Hey, just... let's just calm down.

635
00:36:26,951 --> 00:36:30,070
I'd no idea.

636
00:36:30,071 --> 00:36:34,190
Yeah. But what you do know,
Celia, what you must know,

637
00:36:34,191 --> 00:36:38,990
is that at the best of times that is
a pretty indiscreet thing

638
00:36:38,991 --> 00:36:41,630
to be saying about somebody
to people.

639
00:36:41,631 --> 00:36:44,670
She didn't know.
I mean, I didn't know.

640
00:36:44,671 --> 00:36:46,470
Yeah, but you get the bigger point?

641
00:36:46,471 --> 00:36:49,310
She says she doesn't want any tea,
she says she's not hungry.

642
00:36:49,311 --> 00:36:51,870
I'm sorry. I am sorry, Gillian.

643
00:36:51,871 --> 00:36:53,431
Well, he's gone anyway.

644
00:36:54,711 --> 00:36:56,390
You know what?

645
00:36:56,391 --> 00:36:58,911
I mean, that is... you're...

646
00:37:00,591 --> 00:37:03,510
It's poisonous. Saying something
like that.

647
00:37:03,511 --> 00:37:06,550
I mean, you don't even know us.
You don't know me.

648
00:37:06,551 --> 00:37:10,390
To say something like that to
somebody

649
00:37:10,391 --> 00:37:14,670
when you've got no
idea of the consequences...

650
00:37:14,671 --> 00:37:15,910
Gillian.

651
00:37:15,911 --> 00:37:17,230
What's going on?

652
00:37:17,231 --> 00:37:20,270
Perhaps you'd like to
tell our Raff as well, Celia?

653
00:37:20,271 --> 00:37:21,550
Tell me what?

654
00:37:21,551 --> 00:37:23,910
Look. I've said I'm sorry.
If I'd known I'd not have...

655
00:37:23,911 --> 00:37:27,030
I had an abortion
when I was 15. Didn't I, Celia?

656
00:37:27,031 --> 00:37:29,230
Do you want to go up
and tell Ellie as well?

657
00:37:29,231 --> 00:37:30,870
Who did? You did?

658
00:37:30,871 --> 00:37:32,270
Yeah.

659
00:37:32,271 --> 00:37:34,111
You did? Yeah.

660
00:37:38,111 --> 00:37:41,110
It was Robbie's and he never knew.

661
00:37:41,111 --> 00:37:44,150
But he does now, because Celia's
just told him,

662
00:37:44,151 --> 00:37:45,511
and now he's gone.

663
00:37:47,831 --> 00:37:51,190
Robbie? Not me dad?

664
00:37:51,191 --> 00:37:53,190
Ellie needs to eat.

665
00:37:53,191 --> 00:37:56,550
She can't not eat, it's only been
a week since she gave birth.

666
00:37:56,551 --> 00:38:00,030
Now, go upstairs and tell
her to come down here. Now. Go on.

667
00:38:00,031 --> 00:38:03,190
Look, I'm wondering if it was
better if I went home to Harrogate.

668
00:38:03,191 --> 00:38:06,150
No, it's fine. Look, Celia made
a mistake.

669
00:38:06,151 --> 00:38:07,390
She's apologised.

670
00:38:07,391 --> 00:38:09,710
Oh, that's all right then.

671
00:38:09,711 --> 00:38:12,590
Look, I think I will, I'm popping
upstairs to get my things.

672
00:38:12,591 --> 00:38:16,270
What if I went and talked to Robbie?
No.

673
00:38:16,271 --> 00:38:18,270
Were he cross? Quiet.

674
00:38:18,271 --> 00:38:20,750
Well, then why don't I just
pop down to his house and...

675
00:38:20,751 --> 00:38:23,391
No. I've said. You leave it.
I'm going.

676
00:38:24,711 --> 00:38:27,790
Well, if Celia's going back to
Harrogate, I'll be going with her.

677
00:38:27,791 --> 00:38:31,070
You know... I don't recognise
you any more.

678
00:38:31,071 --> 00:38:36,590
Going looking at dozy big bungalows
that you know you can't afford...

679
00:38:36,591 --> 00:38:37,950
Go get your things.

680
00:38:37,951 --> 00:38:40,750
Chucking your money away on
flash cars that eat petrol and

681
00:38:40,751 --> 00:38:43,390
bugger up the environment.
Not wanting anybody there

682
00:38:43,391 --> 00:38:47,430
when you get wed.
Me, Raff, your mates. Why? Eh? Why?

683
00:38:47,431 --> 00:38:49,271
That is so not you.

684
00:38:50,471 --> 00:38:54,710
And, you know, I have to be frank...

685
00:38:54,711 --> 00:38:58,270
Dad, I don't like it.

686
00:38:58,271 --> 00:39:01,070
I'm aware of that...

687
00:39:01,071 --> 00:39:02,791
I'm increasingly aware of it.

688
00:39:03,871 --> 00:39:07,030
Shall I tell you something? I have
spent my life watching you

689
00:39:07,031 --> 00:39:10,270
go after unsuitable beggars one
after other!

690
00:39:10,271 --> 00:39:12,990
You know what me
and your mother always used to say?

691
00:39:12,991 --> 00:39:14,750
Don't say stuff about my mum.

692
00:39:14,751 --> 00:39:18,830
"Oh, aye, our Gillian,
she always used to pick 'em."

693
00:39:18,831 --> 00:39:20,830
Like it were funny.

694
00:39:20,831 --> 00:39:22,710
But it weren't.

695
00:39:22,711 --> 00:39:25,030
And have I ever fallen out with
you about it?

696
00:39:25,031 --> 00:39:28,390
Ever?
All bloody stupid stuff you did.

697
00:39:28,391 --> 00:39:31,791
All the bloody dozy stuff Eddie did.
No.

698
00:39:32,951 --> 00:39:36,391
I were here all the time,
whenever you needed me.

699
00:39:37,591 --> 00:39:41,070
You know what I'm talking about.
So, don't you dare...

700
00:39:41,071 --> 00:39:44,630
She's a shit-stirrer!
DON'T YOU DARE

701
00:39:44,631 --> 00:39:47,191
say ANYTHING about Celia to me.

702
00:40:04,391 --> 00:40:07,870
"Poisonous."
I could've been in tears.

703
00:40:07,871 --> 00:40:10,950
Do you want me to get involved?
Do you want me to ring her?

704
00:40:10,951 --> 00:40:14,310
No.
I'm off! Oh, hello, Celia.

705
00:40:14,311 --> 00:40:16,910
Hello, love.
See you there.

706
00:40:16,911 --> 00:40:18,590
Yeah.

707
00:40:18,591 --> 00:40:19,951
OK, bye.

708
00:40:24,111 --> 00:40:26,590
Is Alan all right? Is he here?

709
00:40:26,591 --> 00:40:28,870
We drove back last night.
Did you not hear us?

710
00:40:28,871 --> 00:40:32,110
How is he?
I think he's had enough of her.

711
00:40:32,111 --> 00:40:33,710
I think, between you and me,

712
00:40:33,711 --> 00:40:36,950
it sounds like she's been a bit
of a bloody nuisance all her life.

713
00:40:36,951 --> 00:40:38,950
Never at school.

714
00:40:38,951 --> 00:40:42,231
This is after
she went back, after the abortion.

715
00:40:43,591 --> 00:40:45,710
Always over in Manchester at night.

716
00:40:45,711 --> 00:40:50,031
Pink hair, green eyebrows,
studs everywhere.

717
00:40:51,071 --> 00:40:54,790
Course this was when she started
bothering with him.

718
00:40:54,791 --> 00:40:56,230
Eddie.

719
00:40:56,231 --> 00:40:57,751
Bloody Eddie.

720
00:40:59,151 --> 00:41:02,910
Then a few other little incidents -
shoplifting, joyriding.

721
00:41:02,911 --> 00:41:04,430
It was all him.

722
00:41:04,431 --> 00:41:06,831
But she were just daft enough to
go along with it.

723
00:41:08,471 --> 00:41:12,710
And who was it used to have to go
doing all the apologising,

724
00:41:12,711 --> 00:41:17,390
making amends and pointing out that
she wasn't from a bad home,

725
00:41:17,391 --> 00:41:20,950
she'd had a perfectly good
upbringing, thank you...

726
00:41:20,951 --> 00:41:23,790
..and we were just as
upset and bemused

727
00:41:23,791 --> 00:41:25,991
by t'way she carried on as
anyone else.

728
00:41:27,511 --> 00:41:29,590
Well...

729
00:41:29,591 --> 00:41:32,710
I'm sorry you've had it
all to put up with.

730
00:41:32,711 --> 00:41:34,191
Aye, well...

731
00:41:35,831 --> 00:41:38,031
Makes you wonder why you bother.

732
00:41:39,671 --> 00:41:42,870
Well, that can't be any good for
him. Not with his condition.

733
00:41:42,871 --> 00:41:44,430
He's fine, he says.

734
00:41:44,431 --> 00:41:47,590
He says as long as he's with me,
nothing else matters.

735
00:41:47,591 --> 00:41:49,190
I might ring her.

736
00:41:49,191 --> 00:41:52,151
Oh, I wouldn't.
You know she doesn't like you.

737
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:56,630
You shouldn't say things like that.

738
00:41:56,631 --> 00:41:58,110
She's right jealous of you.

739
00:41:58,111 --> 00:41:59,870
Oh, I don't... I've never...

740
00:41:59,871 --> 00:42:01,910
You don't see it.

741
00:42:01,911 --> 00:42:04,391
Right, well, OK.
I'll keep out of it then.

742
00:42:06,511 --> 00:42:07,670
Mum!

743
00:42:07,671 --> 00:42:09,030
Morning.

744
00:42:09,031 --> 00:42:10,071
Phone!

745
00:42:11,391 --> 00:42:12,550
Who is it?

746
00:42:12,551 --> 00:42:13,831
It's for you.

747
00:42:22,831 --> 00:42:24,590
Who?

748
00:42:24,591 --> 00:42:25,911
Have you seen Ellie?

749
00:42:27,911 --> 00:42:31,190
Bit early for Ellie,
isn't it? Who is it?

750
00:42:31,191 --> 00:42:33,430
She's not upstairs.
She's not downstairs.

751
00:42:33,431 --> 00:42:34,990
Her stuff's gone.

752
00:42:34,991 --> 00:42:36,550
Well, she can't have just...?

753
00:42:36,551 --> 00:42:39,310
I've rung her number.
There's no answer.

754
00:42:39,311 --> 00:42:42,271
Well, when did she? I were up
at six o' clock. No idea.

755
00:42:43,391 --> 00:42:45,350
Have you rung her mother's number?
No.

756
00:42:45,351 --> 00:42:47,590
Right. I will.

757
00:42:47,591 --> 00:42:49,550
Not that I imagine it'll do me
any good.

758
00:42:49,551 --> 00:42:51,830
What're we going to with...?

759
00:42:51,831 --> 00:42:54,670
I'm on a shift at Greenhough's
this aft.

760
00:42:54,671 --> 00:42:57,230
Well, I'm going to have to
stop at home then.

761
00:42:57,231 --> 00:42:59,511
No. That's... no.
You're going to school.

762
00:43:00,791 --> 00:43:04,910
But you've fallen out wi' me
grandad again, haven't you, so...?

763
00:43:04,911 --> 00:43:07,351
We'll manage. Won't we.

764
00:43:08,631 --> 00:43:12,070
Eh? How? Little Flossie.

765
00:43:12,071 --> 00:43:14,350
How will you manage?

766
00:43:14,351 --> 00:43:17,070
I'll manage. You're going to school.

767
00:43:17,071 --> 00:43:19,350
Hello?
Gillian. It's Caroline.

768
00:43:19,351 --> 00:43:20,950
Go get ready, pack your bag.

769
00:43:20,951 --> 00:43:22,391
I mean it...

770
00:43:23,511 --> 00:43:25,190
Hello?

771
00:43:25,191 --> 00:43:26,551
It's Caroline.

772
00:43:28,391 --> 00:43:29,670
Caroline.

773
00:43:29,671 --> 00:43:32,710
Sorry, are you busy,
is this a bad time?

774
00:43:32,711 --> 00:43:35,910
What do you want?
If it's a bad time I'll ring later.

775
00:43:35,911 --> 00:43:39,750
We've a lot on,
it's best to just spit it out.

776
00:43:39,751 --> 00:43:42,750
OK. Well, look...

777
00:43:42,751 --> 00:43:46,790
..obviously, I don't know everything
that's been said, but...

778
00:43:46,791 --> 00:43:50,750
..my Mum came round this morning,
and, um...

779
00:43:50,751 --> 00:43:54,310
..well, she was upset.

780
00:43:54,311 --> 00:43:56,390
Was she.

781
00:43:56,391 --> 00:43:57,630
Why? Shh.

782
00:43:57,631 --> 00:44:00,750
I think she knows she's put
her foot in it, Gillian.

783
00:44:00,751 --> 00:44:03,990
Yeah. Large style, big time.

784
00:44:03,991 --> 00:44:05,550
The thing is...

785
00:44:05,551 --> 00:44:08,470
she delves. I've lived with
it all my life,

786
00:44:08,471 --> 00:44:12,190
and I know that's possibly of
no comfort or...

787
00:44:12,191 --> 00:44:15,550
I, on the other hand, haven't, and I
don't intend to start now.

788
00:44:15,551 --> 00:44:18,430
OK, but can I just say that

789
00:44:18,431 --> 00:44:20,911
she is very sorry and she is very
upset.

790
00:44:23,111 --> 00:44:24,511
Gillian?

791
00:44:26,471 --> 00:44:28,751
How's the baby?
It's...

792
00:44:36,311 --> 00:44:38,030
It's a baby.

793
00:44:38,031 --> 00:44:40,670
Yeah, well...

794
00:44:40,671 --> 00:44:43,470
Babies are, aren't they?

795
00:44:43,471 --> 00:44:46,030
I don't know what the hell
I'm doing.

796
00:44:46,031 --> 00:44:48,550
I don't know whether I'm coming
or going, Caroline.

797
00:44:48,551 --> 00:44:50,151
I don't know which way's up.

798
00:44:51,271 --> 00:44:54,990
You're tired.
I can hear it in your voice.

799
00:44:54,991 --> 00:44:56,950
I'm sorry I had a go at your mother,

800
00:44:56,951 --> 00:45:00,350
but, conversely, on the other hand,

801
00:45:00,351 --> 00:45:03,270
I'm sorry she put me
in a position where I had to.

802
00:45:03,271 --> 00:45:06,151
I know, I know. I do know, Gillian.

803
00:45:07,751 --> 00:45:10,430
I don't suppose there's anything I
can do?

804
00:45:10,431 --> 00:45:11,830
Make excuses for me.

805
00:45:11,831 --> 00:45:14,350
Tell her I'm mental.

806
00:45:14,351 --> 00:45:17,870
Hormonal. Round the bloody bend.

807
00:45:17,871 --> 00:45:20,550
Will everything be all right?
With Robbie?

808
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:21,990
Which one's Robbie?

809
00:45:21,991 --> 00:45:24,230
Shh I dunno... Policeman.

810
00:45:24,231 --> 00:45:27,230
..he's not rung me.
And I've not rung him. So...

811
00:45:27,231 --> 00:45:28,711
But, you know.

812
00:45:30,431 --> 00:45:32,110
I've got to go, Caroline.

813
00:45:32,111 --> 00:45:34,831
I've a thousand
and million-one things to do.

814
00:45:38,791 --> 00:45:40,870
Is me dad all right?

815
00:45:40,871 --> 00:45:44,071
Yeah! Yeah.
I will keep an eye on him.

816
00:45:45,591 --> 00:45:47,270
I appreciate you ringing.

817
00:45:47,271 --> 00:45:49,591
Call me. Any time.

818
00:45:50,591 --> 00:45:51,871
Thanks.

819
00:45:52,871 --> 00:45:55,311
Bye. Bye. Bye.

820
00:46:01,711 --> 00:46:06,671
That... was your Auntie Caroline.

821
00:46:08,871 --> 00:46:10,391
But right now...

822
00:46:14,311 --> 00:46:15,911
..it's just you and me, kid.

823
00:46:34,191 --> 00:46:38,471
That's terrific. Well, I'll start
the ball rolling, then.

824
00:46:43,751 --> 00:46:47,550
And I'm pleased for you,
both of you.

825
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:51,750
It's a big thing,
yeah, it's a step forward.

826
00:46:51,751 --> 00:46:53,630
Who you talking to?

827
00:46:53,631 --> 00:46:55,911
OK, love. OK, will do.

828
00:46:57,071 --> 00:46:59,031
Ta-ta.

829
00:47:00,391 --> 00:47:02,030
It's Kimberley.

830
00:47:02,031 --> 00:47:03,990
Darren's got his hours
back at the garage,

831
00:47:03,991 --> 00:47:05,390
and she's spoken to her mum and,

832
00:47:05,391 --> 00:47:07,710
subject to us agreeing a price,
they would like to try

833
00:47:07,711 --> 00:47:09,510
and raise a mortgage and buy it.

834
00:47:09,511 --> 00:47:11,151
Oh!

835
00:47:12,511 --> 00:47:15,590
Are you absolutely sure it's
what you want to do?

836
00:47:15,591 --> 00:47:18,470
Yeah, I think so, yeah.

837
00:47:18,471 --> 00:47:23,470
I'm not forcing you, I'm not leaning
on you, I'm not manipulating you.

838
00:47:23,471 --> 00:47:26,070
You can manipulate me
any time you like.

839
00:47:26,071 --> 00:47:27,870
What about Gillian?

840
00:47:27,871 --> 00:47:31,190
Bugger Gillian. What about her?

841
00:47:31,191 --> 00:47:33,590
I don't like all this bad feeling.

842
00:47:33,591 --> 00:47:38,510
I need to ring an estate agent
and get an idea of a fair price.

843
00:47:38,511 --> 00:47:40,230
And it was my fault.

844
00:47:40,231 --> 00:47:43,871
You apologised. I offered to go
see Robbie. Forget her.

845
00:47:46,031 --> 00:47:48,910
I think I might break it to
Caroline that I'm putting my money

846
00:47:48,911 --> 00:47:52,270
elsewhere after they come
back from their mucky weekend.

847
00:47:52,271 --> 00:47:54,830
What mucky weekend?

848
00:47:54,831 --> 00:47:56,510
Oh, that reminds me.

849
00:47:56,511 --> 00:47:59,470
They're going off on a mucky weekend.

850
00:47:59,471 --> 00:48:03,350
I'm taking Kate to a nice little
hotel for the weekend, next weekend,

851
00:48:03,351 --> 00:48:05,070
just for her birthday.

852
00:48:05,071 --> 00:48:06,430
It's Kate's birthday,

853
00:48:06,431 --> 00:48:09,470
so she's taking her somewhere
posh for a mucky weekend.

854
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:12,110
Granny will be here.
Granny and Alan.

855
00:48:12,111 --> 00:48:13,830
Right.

856
00:48:13,831 --> 00:48:14,950
Right.

857
00:48:14,951 --> 00:48:17,750
And William,
but he'll be working, so...

858
00:48:17,751 --> 00:48:21,470
We're baby-sitting the boys.
I did tell you.

859
00:48:21,471 --> 00:48:23,070
OK?

860
00:48:23,071 --> 00:48:24,310
Whatever.

861
00:48:24,311 --> 00:48:26,830
Not that they need
baby-sitting at their age.

862
00:48:26,831 --> 00:48:28,950
I mustn't have been listening.

863
00:48:28,951 --> 00:48:30,430
Men don't.

864
00:48:30,431 --> 00:48:31,670
Right, Mrs Buttershaw.

865
00:48:31,671 --> 00:48:34,830
I need to do one or two more sums,
so we can weigh up

866
00:48:34,831 --> 00:48:38,271
what sort of offer we'd be in a
position to make. Hmm?

867
00:48:39,351 --> 00:48:41,350
Then I might take you out for lunch.

868
00:48:41,351 --> 00:48:42,831
Oh.

869
00:48:49,431 --> 00:48:52,551
Why don't you and Miss Mackenzie
drive to school together?

870
00:48:54,071 --> 00:48:56,790
Because we don't always finish
work at the same time.

871
00:48:56,791 --> 00:48:58,311
Please call her Kate.

872
00:49:00,111 --> 00:49:01,751
Everyone knows, you know.

873
00:49:03,071 --> 00:49:04,830
And you
need to stop kidding yourself.

874
00:49:04,831 --> 00:49:06,710
cos you just look like a hypocrite.

875
00:49:06,711 --> 00:49:08,950
Which is not a cool message to be
sending out to the

876
00:49:08,951 --> 00:49:12,030
two-point-seven percent of kids
in this school who will one day

877
00:49:12,031 --> 00:49:14,431
turn out to be muff-munching,
shirt-lifters.

878
00:49:16,991 --> 00:49:19,311
I'll see you later.

879
00:49:30,431 --> 00:49:34,030
She's taking Mackenzie
off on a dirty weekend next weekend.

880
00:49:34,031 --> 00:49:35,630
My Granny's looking after us.

881
00:49:35,631 --> 00:49:38,470
Do you want to come round and watch
Reservoir Dogs and get pissed

882
00:49:38,471 --> 00:49:40,951
and trash the place? Yeah.

883
00:50:14,031 --> 00:50:15,430
Hello.

884
00:50:15,431 --> 00:50:16,631
Hi.

885
00:50:18,311 --> 00:50:20,590
So...

886
00:50:20,591 --> 00:50:22,391
Thanks for coming.
No problem.

887
00:50:25,271 --> 00:50:26,591
Tea?

888
00:50:44,791 --> 00:50:47,350
So, where's Ellie gone? Do we know?

889
00:50:47,351 --> 00:50:50,110
I rang her mum
and she said she had no idea,

890
00:50:50,111 --> 00:50:53,590
but then Harry phoned a bit later
and said she was there.

891
00:50:53,591 --> 00:50:55,870
At her mother's. Silly bitch.

892
00:50:55,871 --> 00:50:58,430
Are you all right?

893
00:50:58,431 --> 00:50:59,591
Well...

894
00:51:00,591 --> 00:51:04,471
everyone's fallen out with me,
again, so...

895
00:51:06,711 --> 00:51:11,910
I'm kind of up shit creek
without a paddle, again...

896
00:51:11,911 --> 00:51:13,951
..so, God, I don't know...

897
00:51:17,591 --> 00:51:19,231
It's a bit mad, isn't it?

898
00:51:21,271 --> 00:51:22,671
You and me.

899
00:51:25,231 --> 00:51:27,470
Well, I don't know.
It's not very much madder than

900
00:51:27,471 --> 00:51:29,391
almost everything else that's
happened.

901
00:51:31,151 --> 00:51:32,951
I'm wondering if you're right.

902
00:51:34,511 --> 00:51:36,790
About Robbie.

903
00:51:36,791 --> 00:51:38,111
Me and Robbie.

904
00:51:39,231 --> 00:51:40,750
Really?

905
00:51:40,751 --> 00:51:43,271
It's not just. It's...

906
00:51:50,351 --> 00:51:52,191
I did this thing once.

907
00:51:55,351 --> 00:51:56,791
I've never told anyone.

908
00:51:58,151 --> 00:51:59,750
Except me dad knows.

909
00:51:59,751 --> 00:52:00,911
What thing?

910
00:52:02,751 --> 00:52:04,391
It was when Eddie died.

911
00:52:10,431 --> 00:52:11,831
To us.

912
00:52:13,751 --> 00:52:17,030
I could get used to this,
given another five minutes.

913
00:52:17,031 --> 00:52:19,191
I think I already have.

914
00:52:21,431 --> 00:52:22,910
To the manor born.

915
00:52:22,911 --> 00:52:24,190
The good life.

916
00:52:24,191 --> 00:52:26,071
Till death do us part.

917
00:52:30,231 --> 00:52:32,070
I love you.

918
00:52:32,071 --> 00:52:33,431
I love you.

919
00:52:36,431 --> 00:52:38,030
I'm still feeling guilty.

920
00:52:38,031 --> 00:52:39,910
So, don't.

921
00:52:39,911 --> 00:52:42,110
I didn't even know
she knew Robbie then.

922
00:52:42,111 --> 00:52:44,430
Let it go.

923
00:52:44,431 --> 00:52:46,550
I can't come between you and her.

924
00:52:46,551 --> 00:52:49,151
It's, I'd... I can't do that.

925
00:52:50,831 --> 00:52:52,431
I want to tell you summat.

926
00:52:57,351 --> 00:52:59,990
I nearly did once before but...

927
00:52:59,991 --> 00:53:02,671
I couldn't, so I told you only half
a tale.

928
00:53:03,751 --> 00:53:05,671
It were when Eddie died.

929
00:53:07,871 --> 00:53:11,191
I should've called an ambulance.

930
00:53:13,831 --> 00:53:15,230
And I didn't.

931
00:53:15,231 --> 00:53:19,191
And I'm telling you because...
it's been a burden to me for years.

932
00:53:20,991 --> 00:53:24,030
He'd smashed his head open

933
00:53:24,031 --> 00:53:26,311
with the
log splitter down in t'barn.

934
00:53:27,711 --> 00:53:31,150
And when I met you
that day in Skipton...

935
00:53:31,151 --> 00:53:33,710
and I remembered how much
I was in love with you.

936
00:53:33,711 --> 00:53:35,710
I was so happy.

937
00:53:35,711 --> 00:53:38,470
So properly happy.

938
00:53:38,471 --> 00:53:40,271
Like I hadn't been for years.

939
00:53:41,551 --> 00:53:44,230
With this...
business weighing me down.

940
00:53:44,231 --> 00:53:45,671
So, what happened?

941
00:53:47,031 --> 00:53:48,431
He'd done it on purpose...

942
00:53:49,431 --> 00:53:50,511
he wanted to die.

943
00:53:52,151 --> 00:53:54,911
But when I found him,
he wasn't dead.

944
00:53:57,431 --> 00:54:00,431
And I should've called an ambulance,
but I didn't.

945
00:54:02,391 --> 00:54:05,191
I should've helped him and
instead...

946
00:54:07,831 --> 00:54:10,390
..I just watched him die.

947
00:54:10,391 --> 00:54:12,630
I told you she didn't call
an ambulance,

948
00:54:12,631 --> 00:54:14,151
but it were worse than that.

949
00:54:17,391 --> 00:54:18,791
She'd finished him off...

950
00:54:20,231 --> 00:54:21,511
..with a block of wood.

951
00:54:24,031 --> 00:54:25,191
She killed him.

952
00:54:27,231 --> 00:54:28,431
She said...

953
00:54:29,511 --> 00:54:31,431
..she'd put him out of his misery.

954
00:54:36,511 --> 00:54:39,511
There was nothing anybody
could've done for him.

955
00:54:42,951 --> 00:54:45,031
And I'm telling you this because...

956
00:54:47,511 --> 00:54:51,310
I'd be nervous about getting in
any deeper with Robbie, anyway.

957
00:54:51,311 --> 00:54:54,910
Robbie knew.
He tried to get her arrested,

958
00:54:54,911 --> 00:54:56,391
but he couldn't prove owt.

959
00:54:57,791 --> 00:54:59,471
He was very fond of Eddie.

960
00:55:02,431 --> 00:55:05,511
They were adopted, there was
only ever the pair of 'em.

961
00:55:08,911 --> 00:55:12,431
Only person in the world who ever
mattered to him, really, was Eddie.

962
00:55:16,431 --> 00:55:17,991
And me.

963
00:55:22,511 --> 00:55:24,191
And I let Eddie die.

964
00:55:29,471 --> 00:55:30,950
So, how did you know?

965
00:55:30,951 --> 00:55:34,150
Well, she told me.
Soon as I got there.

966
00:55:34,151 --> 00:55:36,590
I'm sorry I didn't tell you the
truth before.

967
00:55:36,591 --> 00:55:38,910
But I couldn't,
I've never told anyone.

968
00:55:38,911 --> 00:55:41,911
I didn't tell Eileen.
I couldn't have told Eileen.

969
00:55:43,031 --> 00:55:45,830
So, we came up with this tale.

970
00:55:45,831 --> 00:55:48,071
I used to have nightmares after.

971
00:55:50,271 --> 00:55:51,631
I still do.

972
00:55:56,671 --> 00:55:58,471
I sometimes wonder...

973
00:55:59,551 --> 00:56:00,951
If it weren't...

974
00:56:02,031 --> 00:56:03,471
..even suicide.

975
00:56:08,471 --> 00:56:10,391
Although that's what coroner said.

976
00:56:11,831 --> 00:56:15,550
The point is I've done
enough for her over the years -

977
00:56:15,551 --> 00:56:19,191
apologising, covering stuff up
and now I'm happy...

978
00:56:20,311 --> 00:56:22,990
..like I never imagined
I would be

979
00:56:22,991 --> 00:56:25,791
or deserved to be ever again.

980
00:56:28,351 --> 00:56:32,150
And now we're buying this bungalow

981
00:56:32,151 --> 00:56:34,190
and I'm putting all that behind me.

982
00:56:34,191 --> 00:56:35,631
I'm sorry.

983
00:56:38,351 --> 00:56:39,990
Yep.

984
00:56:39,991 --> 00:56:41,351
Blimey.

985
00:56:43,751 --> 00:56:44,871
I am...

986
00:56:46,511 --> 00:56:50,551
very fond of you.
And... I do think we could...

987
00:56:53,111 --> 00:56:54,711
..be good for each other.

988
00:56:58,511 --> 00:57:02,191
I'm going to look after the baby while
you do your shift at Greenhough's.

989
00:57:03,191 --> 00:57:04,990
You sure?

990
00:57:04,991 --> 00:57:06,311
Go to work.

991
00:57:08,431 --> 00:57:10,031
I can do babies.

992
00:57:12,031 --> 00:57:13,551
I'm very good with babies.

993
00:57:31,511 --> 00:57:34,590
So, you're her are you?
You're the whore.

994
00:57:34,591 --> 00:57:37,310
Greg! Kate.

995
00:57:37,311 --> 00:57:40,390
You're on the birth certificate
as the father? Well, not yet.

996
00:57:40,391 --> 00:57:41,990
Oh, well, you want to sort that out.

997
00:57:41,991 --> 00:57:45,350
Celia, it's William.
He's in Outpatients.

998
00:57:45,351 --> 00:57:47,070
Outpatients?

999
00:57:47,071 --> 00:57:49,830
You are unbelievable,
you know that, don't you?

1000
00:57:49,831 --> 00:57:52,270
Somebody with a good heart
like you shouldn't have

1001
00:57:52,271 --> 00:57:53,830
skeletons in their cupboard.

1002
00:57:53,831 --> 00:57:55,430
I'm looking for John. Is he here?

1003
00:57:55,431 --> 00:57:57,870
I want to have a child,
I want to get on with it.

1004
00:57:57,871 --> 00:58:00,590
Something's happened.
I need you to tell him something.

1005
00:58:00,591 --> 00:58:03,191
Bless you,
you were one of life's treasures.

1006
00:58:05,776 --> 00:58:37,993
