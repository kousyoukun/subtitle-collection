1
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,550
I want a baby.
I mean, how...how would it work?

2
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:12,750
Well, obviously a donor.

3
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:15,920
She's pregnant. It's mine.

4
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,790
I'm not having that lad
leaving school,

5
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,310
he could get into university.

6
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,910
Just as long as you know that
I can't see Caroline short either.

7
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,670
Bloody Caroline.

8
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:33,390
What's up with Caroline?
I thought you were mates? Nothing.

9
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,950
I know you said you're seeing
Robbie, but, frankly,

10
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,830
I think you and me both know that
is a disaster. Really?

11
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:41,710
Are you doing anything this weekend?

12
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:43,750
Thing is, we're married now.

13
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,000
You did it?
Yeah, course we did it.

14
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,990
I mean...you know.

15
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,310
Just disappointed.

16
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,710
We didn't want a fuss.

17
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,910
Fair enough, but if I'm being
honest, I'm with 'Arry.

18
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:42,990
Disappointed.

19
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,310
Yeah, well, it's done now, so...

20
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,870
What are we going to call this baby?

21
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,510
What does it look like?

22
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,190
You can see what it looks like.

23
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,070
No, I mean does it look like
a Heather? Or a Barbara?

24
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,070
Or a...Claudette?

25
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:02,310
I think it looks like a bad-tempered
beetroot, personally. But...

26
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,830
Right! It's had enough, it wants
to get its windy-pops up now.

27
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,720
Does great grandad Harry want
to do the honours?

28
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:17,550
"Oh, great grandad Harry, I much
prefer you to great grandad Alan,

29
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:21,350
"because I know that if it'd
been you getting wed, and you'd

30
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,270
"asked him to be your best man,
you'd not have gone sneaking off..."

31
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,470
He wasn't going to ask you,
he'd asked me.

32
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,440
He asked me.
He asked me.

33
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,110
He asked me.

34
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,390
I didn't ask either of you.
You volunteered.

35
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,870
Which I was very flattered by,
and touched, but you're my pals!

36
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:45,150
I couldn't say no to either of you!
So...

37
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,990
And it was what Celia wanted.

38
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,430
What Celia wanted.

39
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,870
I'm sick of having to
explain myself.

40
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,550
She leads you by t'nose.
You know that, don't you?

41
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,310
What did she say?

42
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,710
"I don't want either of them

43
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,990
"two scruffy buggers
being your best man?"

44
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,390
Hey. You talk for yourself...

45
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,350
Funnily enough,
you weren't mentioned.

46
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,280
I scrub up very nicely, thank you.
Are we going to let this drop?

47
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,590
Where is Celia?

48
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,110
Harrogate. Oh, she's coming back.

49
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,880
She's just popped over to fetch
a few bits and pieces.

50
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,750
I mean, can you imagine?

51
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:28,270
She literally didn't know
she was pregnant, she said,

52
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,310
and then - clang - there it is.

53
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:35,070
A baby. I think she's in shock,
I think they all are.

54
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,670
Hello, Celia!

55
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,750
Oh. I thought he'd moved out.

56
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,350
No! Not entirely, not yet.

57
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,110
It hasn't even got a name.

58
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,750
They're calling it "The Baby".

59
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,550
And is it...definitely his?

60
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,190
Oh, yeah. First thing Gillian did was
go down to t'chemist

61
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:53,070
and buy a paternity testing kit.
God.

62
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:57,510
So...Ellie is living at the farm
with "The Baby".

63
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,070
What does her mother think?

64
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,990
Oh, she wants her back home
and at school.

65
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,910
Only I don't think she's
facing the facts.

66
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,790
She's not prepared to help out.

67
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:08,190
She has this high-powered
highly-paid job in the NHS

68
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:11,230
shuffling papers off her desk
onto somebody else's,

69
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:14,750
which she has made it plain she's not
prepared to give up,

70
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,430
or even go part-time,
and why should she?

71
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:22,350
But what she's not addressing is
the situation as it stands.

72
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:27,030
And the husband's no better, he's
a quantity surveyor in Dewsbury.

73
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,390
Divorced.

74
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,550
And he has opinions as well,
but nothing that alters the facts.

75
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,150
So, what's going to happen?

76
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,430
Well, they seem determined to muddle
through at the farm.

77
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,590
Everyone's helping out.
Gillian, Robbie...

78
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,390
How is Gillian?
Harry, me, Alan...

79
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:46,710
I think I've changed its nappy
as often as anyone.

80
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,790
I mean, they do nowt, Raff and Ellie.

81
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,630
Is she still seeing Robbie? Gillian.

82
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,750
I think they're frightened of it,

83
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:55,710
and it's a sweet enough
little thing.

84
00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:00,310
It sickens me, when there's folks
want babies and can't,

85
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,110
you know, honest, hard-working,
decent people...

86
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:07,590
Has it...she really not got a
name?

87
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,150
Well, nothing that's stuck.
Gillian calls her Flossie,

88
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,790
which to me is more what you might
call a King Charles Spaniel.

89
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,830
Alan calls her Emily Jane,

90
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,550
but that's just so he can make it
rhyme with stuff.

91
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:26,150
Harry calls her
Foo-Foo Tinkerbell or summat.

92
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,230
But he's an...idiot.

93
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,190
But she's coping? Gillian.

94
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,790
What would you call a baby?
If you had one?

95
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,990
Oh, well, for a girl, I've always
liked Emily.

96
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,070
And with Alan. It's good, it's...

97
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,870
Or Victoria, Virginia, Elizabeth,
Charlotte.

98
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:45,790
Those sort of more traditional
names...Helen, Helena, Eleanor.

99
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,630
Oh, no, that's Ellie. Or...or
something pretty. Like Flora.

100
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:53,670
Jasmine. Poppy! Grace. That's nice.

101
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,910
Celia! You've got a lovely name.

102
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:59,830
And there's Rose, Rosie, Ros,
Rosamund, Rosalind...

103
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,550
Florence, Maisie, Daisy...

104
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,870
retro, I know, but it's very sweet.
I don't know!

105
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,000
It'll all depend on what
Caroline thinks.

106
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,630
What would?
What's it got to do with Caroline?

107
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:14,110
I mean, if ever...if, if...me and
Caroline...

108
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:17,430
Which, why would we?
..had to choose a baby name.

109
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,070
You and Caroline?
You and Caroline?

110
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,600
Not, not, not that...

111
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,950
Well, you wouldn't have to.
Would you?

112
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,270
Well, no, women...lesb...

113
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,390
Ladies...do have babies.

114
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,600
Do they?

115
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,910
How.

116
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,520
Well, if...

117
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,830
You're not, are you? She's too old.

118
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,510
Yeah, well, she isn't,
technically, and I'm not.

119
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,030
So, hypothetically, in theory...

120
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:51,710
She'd not want to go through
all that again at her age.

121
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,360
No...no.

122
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,590
Where did you say she was?

123
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:04,230
The year-12s are doing
King Lear tonight. So...

124
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,750
That'll be one to
slit your wrists to.

125
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:10,270
So, is that is that something
you're serious about?

126
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:13,390
No. God, no. Is Alan next door?

127
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,070
No, I've left him in Halifax.

128
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:18,070
I just popped over to
get a few bits.

129
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,630
Well...and I wanted five minutes
with Caroline.

130
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:24,550
Any road, will you tell her to pop
round when she's got a minute?

131
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,750
Sure. I mean, not tonight.

132
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:30,480
If she's had to sit through King Lear
she'll just want to lie down.

133
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,550
There.

134
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,870
Hello.

135
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,510
Gillian. It's John.

136
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,560
Yeah.

137
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,150
Sorry. Erm.
I never rang you back last week

138
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:04,390
cos I heard what had happened
and I didn't want to pester you.

139
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,230
Sounds like you've
had your hands full.

140
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,630
Yep.

141
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:10,120
How's...how's...how are things?

142
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,190
Complicated.

143
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:16,030
Right. I was serious
about what I said.

144
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:19,190
About putting money...in my farm?

145
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,870
I would do that, but I meant
more about you.

146
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:24,390
You know, I can't help
thinking it's a mistake.

147
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,230
Right.

148
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,630
I still think about you
all the time.

149
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:32,270
I've started writing again.
John, I...

150
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,590
I wonder if getting the push
from the publisher was

151
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,520
the kick up the arse that I needed.

152
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,910
It's about you.

153
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:42,510
Well, sort of about you.

154
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:45,510
It's about everything.
Everything that's happened.

155
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:49,230
Celia and your dad meeting up again
after all this time.

156
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:53,950
And...mad bitch here,
and her mousey little girlfriend.

157
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:58,070
But your character's
the real central...the...

158
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,790
..point of it all really.
The lynch pin.

159
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,830
The...well, the heroine...

160
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:09,190
..if you like. Gillian?

161
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,870
Right. OK.

162
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:15,030
So, you see...it would
be lovely to meet up.

163
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,510
I don't have to come to the house.
The farm.

164
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:21,470
If that's complicated.
We could just...go out for dinner.

165
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,880
Or a drink.

166
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,560
Hello?

167
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,630
I can't. It's too messy.

168
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,270
I have to go now.

169
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:34,710
Gillian... I'm sorry, I'm hanging
up. I'm glad you're working again.

170
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,440
Bye...bye. Bye-bye.

171
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,630
How was school?

172
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,670
Fine.

173
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,030
She been all right?

174
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,830
No, we sold her to a Chinaman.

175
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,310
Right.

176
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,480
We didn't get much for her.

177
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,350
Have you had something to eat?

178
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,910
Toast.

179
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,630
Toast.

180
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,630
Are you managing to concentrate?

181
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,630
Yeah.
I mean, at school.

182
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,470
Yes!

183
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,480
She needs her nappy changed.

184
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:17,440
Little Nelly needs her nappy changed,
kids.

185
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,030
I said,
the baby needs its nappy changed.

186
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,790
Grandad! What y' doing?
Ooh, knackers!

187
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,390
Were you saving the universe?
Y'shouldn't have done that.

188
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,070
It's not real. Me and your grandad
lived through the Blitz.

189
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,110
Did you 'eck.
Blitz was in t'big cities.

190
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,990
Halifax got one bomb dropped on it,
and that were by accident

191
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,550
cos some plank in the Luftwaffe
couldn't find Manchester.

192
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,030
Oh, they know it all don't they?

193
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:45,070
Except, oh, yeah,
how to avoid getting pregnant.

194
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,350
We wouldn't have made that mistake,
would we, Alan?

195
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,920
Eh? Blitz or no Blitz...

196
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,160
It's me.

197
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,550
Can I come in.

198
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,680
Why are you even friends with him?

199
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,280
It isn't really about him, is it?

200
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,520
I've got to earn some money,
grandad.

201
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,880
Going to school now,
it's just ridiculous

202
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,990
I told him,
he can get a job soon enough,

203
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,760
but I'd be sickened
if he left school, Celia.

204
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,150
Celia?
So, there's no point us looking

205
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,590
for a little bungalow now then,
is there?

206
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,550
Well, we can look, but,

207
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,870
you see, when I was his age,
well, you an' all,

208
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,550
it were never an option.

209
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:24,510
Were it? Staying on at school.

210
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:27,350
If he'd just get his A levels,

211
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,910
he'd always be able to try
for a university at a later stage.

212
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:34,870
Wouldn't he? Which...
well, that's important.

213
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:38,870
Trouble is, he wants to do the
right thing, which I understand,

214
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:42,470
but t'difficulty is,
knowing what the right thing is

215
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,590
when everybody seems to have
so many different opinions.

216
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,110
Yeah. I think somebody at school's
said something nasty

217
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,310
that's upset him.

218
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,790
Well, they will do, they're kids.

219
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:56,510
I don't want him ending up in
a job wi' no prospects,

220
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:59,550
and then for her to just up-sticks
and beggar off anyway

221
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,630
with the baby, which you never know.

222
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:05,830
I mean, I don't know whether they're
still actually seeing one another.

223
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,310
I don't even know that they
ever were

224
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,240
beyond this one evening
of Malibu-fuelled passion.

225
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:16,630
I know he was smitten with her
before, but

226
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:20,110
I'm not so sure now and
she doesn't seem bothered about

227
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:23,270
owt much at the minute,
him included.

228
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,750
You're not telling me
anything I don't know.

229
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,630
I have been there a week.

230
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:31,990
I know, I'm just...I'm struggling
to make sense of it myself.

231
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,750
The more I think about it,
worse it seems to get.

232
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,710
It's a mess, Celia.
It's a right bloody mess.

233
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:43,150
Yeah,
but you haven't to get stressed.

234
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,520
Oh...I'm all right.

235
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,670
I'm missing you.

236
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,150
I'm missing you.

237
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:54,870
Oh, hey up. Madame Lazonga's back.

238
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,280
Who?
Our little Caroline.

239
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,790
Hey,
what do you think about Cordelia?

240
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:04,310
For a name. It's King Lear.
There's three of them.

241
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,150
Daughters - Goneril, Regan
and Cordelia.

242
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,590
I think of the three...

243
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:15,430
Goneril!
Oh, y'just wouldn't, would you?

244
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,070
There's no wonder
they wanted him dead.

245
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,320
Dozy old bugger.

246
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,000
Kate?

247
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,760
Are you all right?

248
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,920
How was King Lear?

249
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:02,190
It was very good,
I was very proud of them.

250
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:05,190
Your mum's back.
I saw the car.

251
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,200
She said to pop round. Not tonight.

252
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,630
Have you been crying?

253
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:13,350
Just feeling sorry for myself.

254
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,710
Why?

255
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,470
Not Lawrence. No.

256
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,270
John? No!

257
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,120
My mother? No.

258
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,960
What then?

259
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,280
Do you want to tell me
about it in bed?

260
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,600
Have you been eating peanuts?

261
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,270
Popcorn at the interval...
That'd do it.

262
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,430
..but I've drunk a whole glass of
wine since then!

263
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,720
That'd wash off any...
Not necessarily. Get the...

264
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:59,750
Where's your handbag?
In there.

265
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,790
Do you want me to do it?
Do you want to do it?

266
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,430
No, you.

267
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:11,430
Here, just right there.

268
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:15,790
You're going to be fine.
I'm going to be fine.

269
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,760
Ambulance.

270
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:24,070
Caroline Elliot,
46 Conway Drive,

271
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,560
Harrogate, HG3 2MC.

272
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,320
I've got someone with anaphylaxia.

273
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,830
Thank you.

274
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:36,870
Four minutes. God, I'm sorry.

275
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,190
I'm fine.

276
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,710
Stupid thing to do!

277
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,230
I don't think I need an ambulance.

278
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,760
It's on its way, it's coming.

279
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,030
Y'have to massage it after
you've injected.

280
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,320
Let me.

281
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:52,030
What were you upset about?

282
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,400
Just.

283
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,160
Babies.

284
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,920
Kate's just had, erm...

285
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,320
I wasn't, uh...

286
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,880
We weren't...

287
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:32,470
You want to get yourself to
bed,

288
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,470
you've got school tomorrow.

289
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,600
I might sleep down here tonight.

290
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,590
Why?

291
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:43,480
Just...
that camp bed's not right comfy.

292
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,630
We should get you a double bed.

293
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,910
Would a double bed fit in that room?
With a cot.

294
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,270
When we get the cot.

295
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,670
I'm fine sleeping down here.

296
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:57,750
What about when little doo-dah needs
feeding during the night?

297
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,590
You can't leave it all to Ellie.

298
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,670
I'll hear her, I'll help her.

299
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,310
You mightn't.

300
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,280
I just, don't want to crowd her.

301
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,950
Who?

302
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,160
Ellie.

303
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,920
We need another bedroom.

304
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:20,470
I'll get you that other duvet...

305
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,080
out of the airing cupboard.

306
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,110
Hospital?

307
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,230
She'll be fine, it happens.

308
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,990
I've given her the morning off work,
anyway.

309
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,070
Oh, hell, steady on.
You don't want to be spoiling her.

310
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,070
Are you just here to dazzle us
all with your sparkling wit

311
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,190
or do you want something?

312
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,590
I haven't see you for a week!

313
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,870
Have I changed?

314
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,190
No, you're just as gorgeous.

315
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,670
Mm. So are you.

316
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:04,470
She said something droll yesterday,
did Kate.

317
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,390
Oh, what. We were discussing
babies' names, you know,

318
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:12,350
for little Fanny Alice
and...she talked like...

319
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:16,440
..you were thinking of having one.
You and her. I said "How?"

320
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,190
Oh, she, we...it's, it's not...

321
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,150
Where's my laptop? And my papers?
Sorry?

322
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,990
They were on the coffee table
in the sitting room. They were right
there in front of me.

323
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,830
Have you been buggering around in
there? It wasn't him, it was me.
I've confiscated them.

324
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,470
Where are they? I'm not telling you.
Where ARE they?

325
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,830
Why don't you talk to me
about Alison Waterhouse?

326
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,950
Who? "A flaccid, overripe fruit of
a woman."

327
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:40,990
I was experimenting with...
language, similes.

328
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,390
It's a metaphor.

329
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,430
It's a lazy metaphor, I mean, what
sort of fruit are we talking about?

330
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,910
A banana? A tangerine?

331
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:49,630
You know, people always think you've
based characters on them

332
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,110
and you haven't.

333
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,470
And can we leave Alison's
"dusky Negress" right out of it?

334
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,630
Or Matthew Waterhouse will be
getting his withering, shrivelling,

335
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,550
starved-of-light, pink little
bollocks chopped right off.

336
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,710
Right. Fine.

337
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,310
Is that what he's put?

338
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:05,830
Adjustments will be made.
Can I have it back?

339
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,670
No. You can whistle.
Caroline!

340
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:11,310
And what about Lizzie Cunningham?
Hmm?

341
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,830
"A latter-day Bathsheba Everdene"
no less,

342
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,110
who owns her own sheep farm

343
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,630
and has more suitors than
she knows what to do with.

344
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,070
Who does that remind us of?

345
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,550
"A sullen, sinewy 40-something
woman

346
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:25,150
"with the purposeful frame and
carriage of a 16-year-old boy".

347
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:27,510
Ooh, la-la! So...

348
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,470
Mummy isn't the only
gay in the village.

349
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,230
I'm sorry, I am sorry, I'm going
to have to ring Gillian...

350
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,830
You are not going to ring Gillian.

351
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:37,830
I am. I'm going to have to
ring Gillian.

352
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,390
You are not ringing Gillian!

353
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:43,360
Right!
Ring bloody sodding Gillian then!

354
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:47,550
Do you mind not using language like
that in front of my mother?

355
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,000
Give it me back.

356
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,310
CAROLINE!?!

357
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,750
What's he put about me?

358
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,550
It's not you...

359
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:59,350
The basic upshot is two people
in their 70s, in love,

360
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,270
who get together after...
ooh, 60 years?

361
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:05,110
But it's not about you, and then
their respective daughters -

362
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:08,030
Alison, the flaccid, overripe
fruit, who just happens to be

363
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:11,510
the headmistress of a very
marvellous public school,

364
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:15,510
and Lizzie, with the body of a
16-year-old boy, and a sheep farm.

365
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,150
I want to read it.

366
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,470
I've not written the
bloody thing yet!

367
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:22,990
No, and I don't think you should if
you're going to be rude about people.

368
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,550
Why were you even reading it anyway?

369
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:26,710
Cos you shouldn't leave
things chucking about.

370
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,750
If this is damaged,
you're paying for a new one.

371
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,200
Oh, that's happening.

372
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,910
Why is he even here?

373
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:38,110
Because he's got nowhere else to go.

374
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:41,630
He reckons to be looking for a flat
to rent near the university

375
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:44,110
till I can buy him out here,
and then he can buy somewhere.

376
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,750
I don't know.

377
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,030
Have you made any decisions yet?

378
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,720
It's all up in the air,
I'm afraid, love.

379
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,840
Go brush your teeth.

380
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,320
You know, Kate's up for it.

381
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:09,390
She's serious, she's had her house
valued, she's got it on the market.

382
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:12,480
OK. But she, erm...

383
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,760
OK. So, the thing is...

384
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,070
It's true. She does want a baby.

385
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,870
If she makes this commitment to me,
to me buying the house,

386
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,870
she wants us to...

387
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,030
How?

388
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:28,190
Oh, don't worry about that.
But the thing is...

389
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,710
Would you really want to go
through all that again?

390
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,950
No. It's unlikely that she'll
ever get pregnant.

391
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,670
She was pregnant four times
when she was married to Richard,

392
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:40,190
but she never got beyond the first
12 weeks.

393
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,270
She's 42,
I've been on the internet,

394
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:45,270
the chances of her getting
pregnant are minute.

395
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,030
And I think she'd be better
concentrating on her career,

396
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:50,150
she's very clever, but,
the thing is...

397
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,310
Sorry, you don't want to hear
this.

398
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,910
Oh, go on. It's her birthday this
coming weekend,

399
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,870
so I'm going to take
her...somewhere nice,

400
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,230
it's a little hotel I've found, and
I've booked it, and I'm going to...

401
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,160
to try and talk her out of it.
For her sake!

402
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:08,390
She'll only end up tearful and
disappointed when it doesn't happen.

403
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,710
I wondered
if you'd keep an eye on the boys?

404
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,150
You and Alan.

405
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,950
There's no point asking John,
he'll just get Judith round again

406
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,560
and trash the place.
Yeah, of course we will, love.

407
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,160
Thank you.

408
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:27,110
What are your plans today?

409
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:30,200
Oh, we're going looking at a
bungalow! Over at Ripponden.

410
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:34,040
You needn't look so worried,
we're only looking.

411
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,480
Good morning. Mrs Buttershaw?

412
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:56,550
How do you do.
You have picked a super day.

413
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,230
It's a smashing view.

414
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,310
Well, it's all in with the price.

415
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:03,430
And this is my husband.
And that's the baby.

416
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,830
We've not been married a week,
and look.

417
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:09,030
You can't hang about, y'see,
not when you get to our age.

418
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,430
Right.

419
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:14,790
He's pulling your leg, love. We're
actually the great grandparents.

420
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:18,550
I know! And me only 36.
Have you remembered the keys?

421
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,470
Yeah.

422
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,190
Boo! Boo! Yes!

423
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,160
Do you like it?

424
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:30,390
What do you reckon?
Oh, it's beautiful.

425
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,670
And we can afford it. Between us.

426
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,920
In theory.

427
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:36,910
I know.

428
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:40,070
It wouldn't need a lot doing.
Maybe a new bathroom,

429
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:43,600
but other than that.
That kitchen's beautiful.

430
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:49,560
We need to win t'lottery,
then we'd have enough for everybody.

431
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,200
Are we kidding ourselves?

432
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:57,000
I think so, don't you?

433
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:00,240
Way things are at the moment.

434
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,990
It's her mother and father that ought
to be forking out for stuff,

435
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,630
not you and Gillian.

436
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:10,750
You're giving her and the baby
a roof over their heads,

437
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:13,550
least they can do is
put their hands in their pockets.

438
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:16,270
Aye, but we can't make 'em, can we?

439
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:20,350
You know your little house,
up Barkisland. Yeah.

440
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:22,430
Have y'ever thought of getting
it valued,

441
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:26,150
and then asking Darren and Kimberley
if they'd like to buy it?

442
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:28,430
Then you'd not be turfing them out.

443
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:31,950
No. No, I hadn't thought of that.

444
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:34,310
Is it something you'd consider?

445
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:37,430
In theory. In practice I doubt it's
something they could afford to do.

446
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,680
Well, you don't know.

447
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:44,110
They might have parents that'd
like to try to help them along.

448
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:46,710
I can ask. But what'd be t'point?

449
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:50,720
If you're thinking of investing
more money in Caroline's house?

450
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:56,030
You realise the alternative
is you and me forever flitting

451
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:58,200
between Harrogate and Halifax.

452
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:02,910
Wouldn't it be nice to have
somewhere of our own?

453
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,750
Well, it would, but...

454
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:08,030
I think you should tell Darren
and Kimberley that

455
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:11,910
your circumstances've changed, and
you need the capital

456
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:15,230
out of that house, whether they can
afford to buy it or not.

457
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,440
Do you?

458
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,550
What's so funny?

459
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,590
You like home truths, don't you?

460
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:25,190
Now and again.
You like to call a spade a spade.

461
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,310
Yes, I do.

462
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:29,270
And here's some more...

463
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:31,870
I know you think Raff should
stop on at school,

464
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:34,110
and I do understand why.

465
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:37,390
But the fact is,
he's muckied his ticket.

466
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:40,070
And if you don't let him
take responsibility for it,

467
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,630
he'll never grow up.

468
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,430
Is that right?
You know it is.

469
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,030
Do you know what I think?

470
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,430
Fire away.

471
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:50,590
I think you ought to tell Caroline
to paddle her own canoe,

472
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,990
and cut her coat according
to her cloth.

473
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,990
Nobody needs a house that big.

474
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,950
There's only four of 'em,

475
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,110
and William'll be off to
university at the end of the summer.

476
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,870
He'll be back in the holidays.
Oh come on, Celia!

477
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:07,110
Her and Kate between 'em,
they must earn a six figure salary.

478
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,870
Well, I've no idea.

479
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:12,190
Easily. Caroline probably
earns that on her own.

480
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:16,230
Why should she expect
money from you as well?

481
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:19,630
Caroline was very good to me
after Kenneth died.

482
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,430
I'm sure she were, but now,

483
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:25,230
eight years on,
your circumstances have changed.

484
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,870
She should sell that house

485
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:31,200
and find somewhere just as lovely
only happen a bit smaller.

486
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:39,470
You do realise if you keep taking
that baby out so much,

487
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:43,520
it's going to get very
confused about who its mother is.

488
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,320
I'm serious!

489
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,230
What time will Gillian be home?

490
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,430
She's on t'late shift down at
Greenhough's.

491
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:03,230
They close at eight,
she's generally back by 20 past.

492
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,870
Is there anything I can be doing?

493
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,040
No, you're all right love.

494
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:11,510
It had a grand big sitting room.

495
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,070
They're very sought-after
properties them up there.

496
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,750
Are they? Oh, aye. It'd be a good
investment, if nowt else.

497
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:19,870
It won't hang around, even wi'
t'property market like it is.

498
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:24,510
I do like round here.
I suppose it feels like coming home.

499
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:26,550
Well, it is, isn't it?

500
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:29,830
Nearly.
Elland was our stomping ground.

501
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,430
What's Alan think?

502
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:35,270
Oh, he was just as taken
with it as I was.

503
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:38,750
Are they all right now?
Gillian and Alan?

504
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:42,630
Gillian and Alan? Yeah, I think so.

505
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,190
Cos you know she were really upset.

506
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:48,550
Oh, she was just bothered cos we
got married without telling anyone.

507
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,070
No, I mean before.

508
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,910
That whole two weeks
when you were over in Harrogate,

509
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:55,070
there were summat up.

510
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:59,030
Oh...something about Eileen.
Her mother.

511
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:01,400
Something about being disappointed...

512
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,800
Oh, I know what it was.

513
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:09,870
Gillian had an abortion, apparently,
when she was 15.

514
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:14,070
She had to leave school and, oh, it
all got brought up again,

515
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,510
and it all
seemed to be about that,

516
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,390
but don't say anything love.

517
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,990
I assume Raff doesn't know.

518
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,030
And what upset Gillian

519
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:26,600
was Alan saying how
disappointed her mother was.

520
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:32,080
That's all, it's all water under
t'bridge now, so.

521
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,480
I spoke to Greg.

522
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:38,470
You spoke to him? How?

523
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,830
He rang this afternoon.
Just before you got back from work.

524
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,960
He wants to pop over
for my birthday.

525
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,040
Actually on your birthday?

526
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,440
Well...

527
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,590
OK, but what if I'd made plans
for your birthday?

528
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,310
Have you?

529
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:01,110
You didn't, you didn't...what...
You didn't talk to him about...?

530
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,270
I mentioned it.
Mentioned it how?

531
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:06,270
Well, I explained.
What we've discussed, and he said...

532
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:09,550
yeah, that he'd be more than happy
to help out.

533
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,870
We've not made any, you know,
plans.

534
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:14,600
Obviously. I said, obviously, you'd
want to meet him first.

535
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,950
I've booked a hotel
for a couple of nights.

536
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,870
Caroline.

537
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,510
Do you want me to cancel it?

538
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,950
No, oh, no...

539
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,600
but I want you to meet him. Soon.

540
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:32,350
Where is it? The hotel.
You're not suggesting...?

541
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:35,470
He could just meet us for a drink.
I'm not suggesting that we do the...

542
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:38,190
No, I'm just suggesting that you
meet him. Get to know him.

543
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,840
I don't need to get to know him.
You need to meet him.

544
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,480
It's a bad idea.
No. It's not. It's...

545
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:59,830
Fine, ask him for a drink. Maybe
it's better that we meet him there,

546
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,910
rather than here. What's the matter?
What's the matter is that

547
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:05,910
you're going to get pregnant,
possibly, with someone else, which

548
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:08,190
is fine in so far as you can't get
pregnant with me,

549
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,830
but beyond that...
It's...less fine.

550
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:13,750
There are things that I haven't...

551
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,680
processed, yet.

552
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:20,550
I assume I don't need to
spell them out.

553
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,760
It is the most likely way
for it to work.

554
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:30,670
You do know that whatever way,
it's kind of unlikely, don't you?

555
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:35,710
I know the odds aren't great. Yes.
I want to try though, Caroline.

556
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,950
And I'm terrified of leaving it any
longer.

557
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:39,390
What if it doesn't happen?

558
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:42,470
I'll deal with it.
You'll get upset. Well...

559
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:45,190
It's better to try and fail again

560
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,960
before I give up for good,
though, isn't it?

561
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:51,190
You've got a fantastic career.

562
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:54,310
You'll be the next head of languages
- you will, no contest -

563
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:58,430
you could be a deputy head in a few
very short years.

564
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:00,160
You've got what it takes, Kate.

565
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,240
I want to be somebody's mum.

566
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,800
Do you think we should get married?

567
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,120
Don't be daft.

568
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:02,790
Hiya!
Casserole for y'all in the oven.

569
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,190
Are you not stopping?

570
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,910
No, I'm...
I've got stuff to do at home.

571
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:09,150
What's up?

572
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,200
Did you have an abortion
when you were 15?

573
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:17,960
Was it mine?

574
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:20,920
Yeah.

575
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:25,030
Who's...? How's...?

576
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,480
Celia.

577
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:31,630
Celia? Just...chatting. Just asked
her why you and Alan fell out

578
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:33,510
when he stayed over in Harrogate.

579
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:35,670
You haven't to think, there was,
I never...

580
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,070
Why did you never tell me?

581
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:38,560
I was 15.

582
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,320
I'd forgotten.

583
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:46,030
It'd have been 30-odd now.

584
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,670
31.

585
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:51,030
I could never have had it.
There were no point telling you.

586
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,280
No.

587
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:56,560
I'm sorry. No, I'm just...

588
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:00,590
I just never knew.
I'd been a dad.

589
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,630
You weren't.

590
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:06,080
And then...
you went off with our Eddie.

591
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,990
I'm not being funny,
but I'm off home.

592
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,990
Right. And are you coming back?

593
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,960
Not tonight.
Will you ring me?

594
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,400
Are you dumping me?

595
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,720
I just don't want to be here.
For a bit.

596
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:26,950
So, how is this "not being funny"?
Then.

597
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:30,670
If you're "just going home"?
Are you feeling sorry for yourself?

598
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:32,710
Cos I was the one that had
to leave school,

599
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:35,510
I was the one that never got
a crack at their A levels.

600
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,270
And I could've done, I wasn't thick.

601
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:40,950
I never told you, but I never
inflicted anything on you either.

602
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,790
I'm going home.

603
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,200
Right.

604
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,470
(What a bitch.)

605
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,910
Is that you, love?

606
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,790
Yeah.

607
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,000
Yeah.

608
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:16,870
Yeah, it's me.
I fell asleep.

609
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:19,310
So did I.

610
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,390
Supper's ready. Where's Ellie?

611
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,080
Do you want to give her a shout?

612
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:29,310
Robbie's gone.
Has he?

613
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,790
Shall I set the table, love?

614
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:34,190
He's cooked everybody's tea,
and now he's gone.

615
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,150
I didn't know he was here.

616
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,510
You did.

617
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,910
Did I?

618
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,470
Oh, he's been asleep.

619
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,710
He's gone,
and he's not in a very good mood.

620
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,950
Has somebody said something to him?

621
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,750
What about?

622
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:49,400
Me. How do you mean? Oh. What?

623
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:56,800
Celia told Robbie that
I had an abortion when I was 15.

624
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,430
Well, the thing is,

625
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:05,830
he asked me why you
and your dad'd fallen out, so...

626
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,950
It was his. Whose?

627
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,670
Robbie's. Robbie...?

628
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:12,710
So, and he never knew
and now he does.

629
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:15,430
So, he's gone. Robbie?

630
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:18,550
I used to see him
before I started seeing Eddie.

631
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:21,270
Well, I...I didn't know that.

632
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,870
Why were you telling him
stuff about me anyway?

633
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,960
Hey, just...let's just calm down.

634
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:30,390
I'd no idea.

635
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:34,510
Yeah. But what you do know,
Celia, what you must know,

636
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:39,310
is that at the best of times that is
a pretty indiscreet thing

637
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:41,950
to be saying about somebody
to people.

638
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:44,990
She didn't know.
I mean, I didn't know.

639
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,790
Yeah, but you get the bigger point?

640
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,630
She says she doesn't want any tea,
she says she's not hungry.

641
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:52,190
I'm sorry. I am sorry, Gillian.

642
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,760
Well, he's gone anyway.

643
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,710
You know what?

644
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:59,240
I mean, that is...you're...

645
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:03,830
It's poisonous. Saying something
like that.

646
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:06,870
I mean, you don't even know us.
You don't know me.

647
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:10,710
To say something like that to
somebody

648
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:14,990
when you've got no
idea of the consequences...

649
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,230
Gillian.

650
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,550
What's going on?

651
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:20,590
Perhaps you'd like to
tell our Raff as well, Celia?

652
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:21,870
Tell me what?

653
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:24,230
Look. I've said I'm sorry.
If I'd known I'd not have...

654
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:27,350
I had an abortion
when I was 15. Didn't I, Celia?

655
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,550
Do you want to go up
and tell Ellie as well?

656
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:31,190
Who did? You did?

657
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,590
Yeah.

658
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,440
You did? Yeah.

659
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:41,430
It was Robbie's and he never knew.

660
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:44,470
But he does now, because Celia's
just told him,

661
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,840
and now he's gone.

662
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:51,510
Robbie? Not me dad?

663
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,510
Ellie needs to eat.

664
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:56,870
She can't not eat, it's only been
a week since she gave birth.

665
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:00,350
Now, go upstairs and tell
her to come down here. Now. Go on.

666
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:03,510
Look, I'm wondering if it was
better if I went home to Harrogate.

667
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:06,470
No, it's fine. Look, Celia made
a mistake.

668
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,710
She's apologised.

669
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:10,030
Oh, that's all right then.

670
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:12,910
Look, I think I will, I'm popping
upstairs to get my things.

671
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:16,590
What if I went and talked to Robbie?
No.

672
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,590
Were he cross? Quiet.

673
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:21,070
Well, then why don't I just
pop down to his house and...

674
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:23,720
No. I've said. You leave it.
I'm going.

675
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:28,110
Well, if Celia's going back to
Harrogate, I'll be going with her.

676
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:31,390
You know...I don't recognise
you any more.

677
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:36,910
Going looking at dozy big bungalows
that you know you can't afford...

678
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,270
Go get your things.

679
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:41,070
Chucking your money away on
flash cars that eat petrol and

680
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:43,710
bugger up the environment.
Not wanting anybody there

681
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:47,750
when you get wed.
Me, Raff, your mates. Why? Eh? Why?

682
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,600
That is so not you.

683
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:55,030
And, you know, I have to be frank...

684
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:58,590
Dad, I don't like it.

685
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:01,390
I'm aware of that...

686
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:03,120
I'm increasingly aware of it.

687
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:07,350
Shall I tell you something? I have
spent my life watching you

688
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:10,590
go after unsuitable beggars one
after other!

689
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:13,310
You know what me
and your mother always used to say?

690
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:15,070
Don't say stuff about my mum.

691
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:19,150
"Oh, aye, our Gillian,
she always used to pick 'em."

692
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:21,150
Like it were funny.

693
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:23,030
But it weren't.

694
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:25,350
And have I ever fallen out with
you about it?

695
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:28,710
Ever?
All bloody stupid stuff you did.

696
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:32,120
All the bloody dozy stuff Eddie did.
No.

697
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:36,720
I were here all the time,
whenever you needed me.

698
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:41,390
You know what I'm talking about.
So, don't you dare...

699
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:44,950
She's a shit-stirrer!

700
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:47,520
say ANYTHING about Celia to me.

701
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:08,190
"Poisonous."
I could've been in tears.

702
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:11,270
Do you want me to get involved?
Do you want me to ring her?

703
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:14,630
No.
I'm off! Oh, hello, Celia.

704
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:17,230
Hello, love.
See you there.

705
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:18,910
Yeah.

706
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:20,280
OK, bye.

707
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:26,910
Is Alan all right? Is he here?

708
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:29,190
We drove back last night.
Did you not hear us?

709
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:32,430
How is he?
I think he's had enough of her.

710
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:34,030
I think, between you and me,

711
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:37,270
it sounds like she's been a bit
of a bloody nuisance all her life.

712
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,270
Never at school.

713
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:42,560
This is after
she went back, after the abortion.

714
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:46,030
Always over in Manchester at night.

715
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:50,360
Pink hair, green eyebrows,
studs everywhere.

716
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:55,110
Course this was when she started
bothering with him.

717
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:56,550
Eddie.

718
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,080
Bloody Eddie.

719
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:03,230
Then a few other little incidents -
shoplifting, joyriding.

720
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:04,750
It was all him.

721
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:07,160
But she were just daft enough to
go along with it.

722
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:13,030
And who was it used to have to go
doing all the apologising,

723
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:17,710
making amends and pointing out that
she wasn't from a bad home,

724
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:21,270
she'd had a perfectly good
upbringing, thank you...

725
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:24,110
..and we were just as
upset and bemused

726
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:26,320
by t'way she carried on as
anyone else.

727
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,910
Well...

728
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:33,030
I'm sorry you've had it
all to put up with.

729
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,520
Aye, well...

730
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,360
Makes you wonder why you bother.

731
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,190
Well, that can't be any good for
him. Not with his condition.

732
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,750
He's fine, he says.

733
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:47,910
He says as long as he's with me,
nothing else matters.

734
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,510
I might ring her.

735
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:52,480
Oh, I wouldn't.
You know she doesn't like you.

736
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:56,950
You shouldn't say things like that.

737
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,430
She's right jealous of you.

738
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:00,190
Oh, I don't...I've never...

739
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:02,230
You don't see it.

740
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:04,720
Right, well, OK.
I'll keep out of it then.

741
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:07,990
Mum!

742
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,350
Morning.

743
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,400
Phone!

744
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:12,870
Who is it?

745
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,150
It's for you.

746
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:24,910
Who?

747
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:26,240
Have you seen Ellie?

748
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:31,510
Bit early for Ellie,
isn't it? Who is it?

749
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,750
She's not upstairs.
She's not downstairs.

750
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,310
Her stuff's gone.

751
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:36,870
Well, she can't have just...?

752
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:39,630
I've rung her number.
There's no answer.

753
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:42,600
Well, when did she? I were up
at six o' clock. No idea.

754
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:45,670
Have you rung her mother's number?
No.

755
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:47,910
Right. I will.

756
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:49,870
Not that I imagine it'll do me
any good.

757
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:52,150
What're we going to with...?

758
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:54,990
I'm on a shift at Greenhough's
this aft.

759
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,550
Well, I'm going to have to
stop at home then.

760
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:59,840
No. That's...no.
You're going to school.

761
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:05,230
But you've fallen out wi' me
grandad again, haven't you, so...?

762
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:07,680
We'll manage. Won't we.

763
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:12,390
Eh? How? Little Flossie.

764
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,670
How will you manage?

765
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:17,390
I'll manage. You're going to school.

766
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:19,670
Hello?
Gillian. It's Caroline.

767
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,270
Go get ready, pack your bag.

768
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:22,720
(I mean it...)

769
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:25,510
Hello?

770
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:26,880
It's Caroline.

771
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:29,990
Caroline.

772
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,030
Sorry, are you busy,
is this a bad time?

773
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:36,230
What do you want?
If it's a bad time I'll ring later.

774
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:40,070
We've a lot on,
it's best to just spit it out.

775
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:43,070
OK. Well, look...

776
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:47,110
..obviously, I don't know everything
that's been said, but...

777
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:51,070
..my Mum came round this morning,
and, um...

778
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:54,630
..well, she was upset.

779
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:56,710
Was she.

780
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:57,950
(Why?) Shh.

781
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:01,070
I think she knows she's put
her foot in it, Gillian.

782
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:04,310
Yeah. Large style, big time.

783
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:05,870
The thing is...

784
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:08,790
she delves. I've lived with
it all my life,

785
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:12,510
and I know that's possibly of
no comfort or...

786
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:15,870
I, on the other hand, haven't, and I
don't intend to start now.

787
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:18,750
OK, but can I just say that

788
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:21,240
she is very sorry and she is very
upset.

789
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:24,840
Gillian?

790
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:29,080
How's the baby?
It's...

791
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,350
It's a baby.

792
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:40,990
Yeah, well...

793
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,790
Babies are, aren't they?

794
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:46,350
I don't know what the hell
I'm doing.

795
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:48,870
I don't know whether I'm coming
or going, Caroline.

796
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:50,480
I don't know which way's up.

797
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:55,310
You're tired.
I can hear it in your voice.

798
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:57,270
I'm sorry I had a go at your mother,

799
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:00,670
but, conversely, on the other hand,

800
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:03,590
I'm sorry she put me
in a position where I had to.

801
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:06,480
I know, I know. I do know, Gillian.

802
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:10,750
I don't suppose there's anything I
can do?

803
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:12,150
Make excuses for me.

804
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:14,670
Tell her I'm mental.

805
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:18,190
Hormonal. Round the bloody bend.

806
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:20,870
Will everything be all right?
With Robbie?

807
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:22,310
(Which one's Robbie?)

808
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:24,550
(Shh) I dunno... (Policeman.)

809
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:27,550
..he's not rung me.
And I've not rung him. So...

810
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:29,040
But, you know.

811
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:32,430
I've got to go, Caroline.

812
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:35,160
I've a thousand
and million-one things to do.

813
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:41,190
Is me dad all right?

814
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:44,400
Yeah! Yeah.
I will keep an eye on him.

815
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:47,590
I appreciate you ringing.

816
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:49,920
Call me. Any time.

817
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:52,200
Thanks.

818
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:55,640
Bye. Bye. Bye.

819
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:07,000
That...was your Auntie Caroline.

820
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:10,720
But right now...

821
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:16,240
..it's just you and me, kid.

822
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:38,800
That's terrific. Well, I'll start
the ball rolling, then.

823
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:47,870
And I'm pleased for you,
both of you.

824
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:52,070
It's a big thing,
yeah, it's a step forward.

825
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:53,950
(Who you talking to?)

826
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:56,240
OK, love. OK, will do.

827
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:59,360
Ta-ta.

828
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:02,350
It's Kimberley.

829
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:04,310
Darren's got his hours
back at the garage,

830
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:05,710
and she's spoken to her mum and,

831
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:08,030
subject to us agreeing a price,
they would like to try

832
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:09,830
and raise a mortgage and buy it.

833
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:11,480
Oh!

834
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:15,910
Are you absolutely sure it's
what you want to do?

835
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:18,790
Yeah, I think so, yeah.

836
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:23,790
I'm not forcing you, I'm not leaning
on you, I'm not manipulating you.

837
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:26,390
You can manipulate me
any time you like.

838
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,190
What about Gillian?

839
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:31,510
Bugger Gillian. What about her?

840
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:33,910
I don't like all this bad feeling.

841
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:38,830
I need to ring an estate agent
and get an idea of a fair price.

842
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:40,550
And it was my fault.

843
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:44,200
You apologised. I offered to go
see Robbie. Forget her.

844
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:49,230
I think I might break it to
Caroline that I'm putting my money

845
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:52,590
elsewhere after they come
back from their mucky weekend.

846
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:55,150
What mucky weekend?

847
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:56,830
Oh, that reminds me.

848
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:59,790
They're going off on a mucky weekend.

849
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:03,670
I'm taking Kate to a nice little
hotel for the weekend, next weekend,

850
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:05,390
just for her birthday.

851
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:06,750
It's Kate's birthday,

852
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:09,790
so she's taking her somewhere
posh for a mucky weekend.

853
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:12,430
Granny will be here.
Granny and Alan.

854
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:14,150
Right.

855
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:15,270
Right.

856
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:18,070
And William,
but he'll be working, so...

857
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:21,790
We're baby-sitting the boys.
I did tell you.

858
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:23,390
OK?

859
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:24,630
Whatever.

860
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:27,150
Not that they need
baby-sitting at their age.

861
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:29,270
I mustn't have been listening.

862
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:30,750
Men don't.

863
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:31,990
Right, Mrs Buttershaw.

864
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,150
I need to do one or two more sums,
so we can weigh up

865
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:38,600
what sort of offer we'd be in a
position to make. Hmm?

866
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:41,670
Then I might take you out for lunch.

867
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:43,160
Oh.

868
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,880
Why don't you and Miss Mackenzie
drive to school together?

869
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:57,110
Because we don't always finish
work at the same time.

870
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:58,640
Please call her Kate.

871
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:02,080
Everyone knows, you know.

872
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:05,150
And you
need to stop kidding yourself.

873
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:07,030
cos you just look like a hypocrite.

874
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:09,270
Which is not a cool message to be
sending out to the

875
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:12,350
two-point-seven percent of kids
in this school who will one day

876
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:14,760
turn out to be muff-munching,
shirt-lifters.

877
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:19,640
I'll see you later.

878
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:34,350
She's taking Mackenzie
off on a dirty weekend next weekend.

879
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:35,950
My Granny's looking after us.

880
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:38,790
Do you want to come round and watch
Reservoir Dogs and get pissed

881
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:41,280
and trash the place? Yeah.

882
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:15,750
Hello.

883
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:16,960
Hi.

884
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:20,910
So...

885
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:22,720
Thanks for coming.
No problem.

886
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:26,920
Tea?

887
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:47,670
So, where's Ellie gone? Do we know?

888
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:50,430
I rang her mum
and she said she had no idea,

889
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:53,910
but then Harry phoned a bit later
and said she was there.

890
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:56,190
At her mother's. Silly bitch.

891
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:58,750
Are you all right?

892
00:50:58,760 --> 00:50:59,920
Well...

893
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:04,800
everyone's fallen out with me,
again, so...

894
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:12,230
I'm kind of up shit creek
without a paddle, again...

895
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:14,280
..so, God, I don't know...

896
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:19,560
It's a bit mad, isn't it?

897
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:23,000
You and me.

898
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:27,790
Well, I don't know.
It's not very much madder than

899
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:29,720
almost everything else that's
happened.

900
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:33,280
I'm wondering if you're right.

901
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:37,110
About Robbie.

902
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:38,440
Me and Robbie.

903
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:41,070
Really?

904
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:43,600
It's not just. It's...

905
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:52,520
I did this thing once.

906
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:57,120
I've never told anyone.

907
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:00,070
Except me dad knows.

908
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:01,240
What thing?

909
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:04,720
It was when Eddie died.

910
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:12,160
To us.

911
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:17,350
I could get used to this,
given another five minutes.

912
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:19,520
I think I already have.

913
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:23,230
To the manor born.

914
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:24,510
The good life.

915
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:26,400
Till death do us part.

916
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:32,390
I love you.

917
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:33,760
I love you.

918
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:38,350
I'm still feeling guilty.

919
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:40,230
So, don't.

920
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:42,430
I didn't even know
she knew Robbie then.

921
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:44,750
Let it go.

922
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:46,870
I can't come between you and her.

923
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:49,480
It's, I'd...I can't do that.

924
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:52,760
I want to tell you summat.

925
00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:00,310
I nearly did once before but...

926
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:03,000
I couldn't, so I told you only half
a tale.

927
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:06,000
It were when Eddie died.

928
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:11,520
I should've called an ambulance.

929
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:15,550
And I didn't.

930
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:19,520
And I'm telling you because...
it's been a burden to me for years.

931
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:24,350
He'd smashed his head open

932
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:26,640
with the
log splitter down in t'barn.

933
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:31,470
And when I met you
that day in Skipton...

934
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:34,030
and I remembered how much
I was in love with you.

935
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:36,030
I was so happy.

936
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:38,790
So properly happy.

937
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:40,600
Like I hadn't been for years.

938
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:44,550
With this...
business weighing me down.

939
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:46,000
So, what happened?

940
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:48,760
He'd done it on purpose...

941
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:50,840
he wanted to die.

942
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:55,240
But when I found him,
he wasn't dead.

943
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:00,760
And I should've called an ambulance,
but I didn't.

944
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:05,520
I should've helped him and
instead...

945
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:10,710
..I just watched him die.

946
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:12,950
I told you she didn't call
an ambulance,

947
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:14,480
but it were worse than that.

948
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:19,120
She'd finished him off...

949
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:21,840
..with a block of wood.

950
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:25,520
She killed him.

951
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:28,760
She said...

952
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:31,760
..she'd put him out of his misery.

953
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:39,840
There was nothing anybody
could've done for him.

954
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:45,360
And I'm telling you this because...

955
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:51,630
I'd be nervous about getting in
any deeper with Robbie, anyway.

956
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:55,230
Robbie knew.
He tried to get her arrested,

957
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:56,720
but he couldn't prove owt.

958
00:54:58,120 --> 00:54:59,800
He was very fond of Eddie.

959
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:05,840
They were adopted, there was
only ever the pair of 'em.

960
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:12,760
Only person in the world who ever
mattered to him, really, was Eddie.

961
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:18,320
And me.

962
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:24,520
And I let Eddie die.

963
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:31,270
So, how did you know?

964
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:34,470
Well, she told me.
Soon as I got there.

965
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:36,910
I'm sorry I didn't tell you the
truth before.

966
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:39,230
But I couldn't,
I've never told anyone.

967
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:42,240
I didn't tell Eileen.
I couldn't have told Eileen.

968
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:46,150
So, we came up with this tale.

969
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:48,400
I used to have nightmares after.

970
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:51,960
I still do.

971
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,800
I sometimes wonder...

972
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:01,280
If it weren't...

973
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:03,800
..even suicide.

974
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:10,720
Although that's what coroner said.

975
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:15,870
The point is I've done
enough for her over the years -

976
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:19,520
apologising, covering stuff up
and now I'm happy...

977
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:23,310
..like I never imagined
I would be

978
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:26,120
or deserved to be ever again.

979
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:32,470
And now we're buying this bungalow

980
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:34,510
and I'm putting all that behind me.

981
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:35,960
I'm sorry.

982
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:40,310
Yep.

983
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:41,680
Blimey.

984
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:45,200
I am...

985
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:50,880
very fond of you.
And...I do think we could...

986
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:55,040
..be good for each other.

987
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:02,520
I'm going to look after the baby
while you do your shift at
Greenhough's.

988
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:05,310
You sure?

989
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:06,640
Go to work.

990
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:10,360
I can do babies.

991
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:13,880
I'm very good with babies.

992
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:34,910
So, you're her are you?
You're the whore.

993
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:37,630
Greg! Kate.

994
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:40,710
You're on the birth certificate
as the father? Well, not yet.

995
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:42,310
Oh, well, you want to sort that out.

996
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:45,670
Celia, it's William.
He's in Outpatients.

997
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:47,390
Outpatients?

998
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:50,150
You are unbelievable,
you know that, don't you?

999
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:52,590
Somebody with a good heart
like you shouldn't have

1000
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:54,150
skeletons in their cupboard.

1001
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:55,750
I'm looking for John. Is he here?

1002
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:58,190
I want to have a child,
I want to get on with it.

1003
00:57:58,200 --> 00:58:00,910
Something's happened.
I need you to tell him something.

1004
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:03,520
Bless you,
you were one of life's treasures.
