<font color="#8B0000">(前情提要)</font> 没见过像你这么开车的
That is the most selfish, 

2
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:05,750
自私自利 不管不顾
mindless piece of driving I have ever witnessed.

3
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:07,410
别发脾气 我用不了一分钟就走人
Keep your hair on, I'll be under 60 seconds.

4
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:09,120
蠢货      不要脸的贱人
Idiot.        Snotty bitch.

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,930
有个下流脑残的垃圾货占了我车位
Some braindead, lowlife, trailer trash stole my parking space.

6
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:15,600
你见过我女儿了吧?      什么?
And you've met my daughter?        Sorry?

7
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:18,030
好了 我们有个消息要告诉你们

You're very pretty.        You're magnificent.

You mad cow!       This marriage is over! 

11
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:34,130
死了! 散伙了! 从没存在过!
It is dead! It is redundant! It never was!

12
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:35,670
我们做爱了
We made love.

13
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:37,760
那天是我生日 咱俩都有点醉了
It was my birthday, we were both a bit pissed.

14
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:42,250
他在医院 昨晚被送去的 心脏病犯了
'He's in hospital. He were rushed in last night. He had a heart attack.'

15
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:45,150
我昨晚去见你了吗?
Did I come to see you last night?

16
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,380
艾伦?      还是我在做梦?
Alan?        Or were I dreaming?

17
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:54,420
是的 你来了 你来见我了

他醒过来了 他恢复意识了
He's come round, he's regained consciousness.

23
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,000
哦 妈妈
'Oh, Mum!'

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,500
吉莉安刚进去看他了 她在跟他说话呢
Gillian's just in with him just now. She's just chatting to him.

25
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,410
艾伦醒过来了
Alan's come round.

26
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:00,150
那他们...
'And are they...?'

27
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:03,380
那他...他们是不是确定他能...?
Is he, erm...? Are they confident he's going to...?

28
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:08,290
现在说还早 不过他看起来很精神
Well, I mean, it's early days but he seems very perky.

29
00:02:08,290 --> 00:02:09,680
别累着他
'You mustn't tire him.'

30
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,810
我不会让他累到
I'm not going to tire him!

31
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:17,720
我爱你
I love you.

我爱你
I love you.

33
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,910
我想我也爱西莉亚
I think I love Celia as well.

34
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,040
我也爱
So do I.

35
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,410
嘿 你离她远点儿 她是我的
Hey, you can keep your hands off her. She's mine.

36
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:40,750
你是怎么打算的呢?
What are you going to do?

37
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:42,640
是留下来跟我们一起 还是...?
Are you going to stay with us here, or are you...?

38
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,580
哦 接下来几天我都想留在这边
Oh, I think I'd like to be on hand over the next few days,

39
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:48,420
直到我们知道情况如何
just till we know what's what. 

40
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:49,370
我是说 如果这样...
I mean, if that's...

41
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:51,440
那太好了 太好了 
It's wonderful, it's perfect.

42
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,890
要不要我开车到哈罗盖特给你拿东西?
Do you want me to drive over to Harrogate, fetch any of your things?

43
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:58,120
不 不用 你现在不能离开 你得待在这儿
No, no. You don't want to be setting off, you need to be here.

44
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:01,660
不用 我让讨人厌女士收拾点东西带过来
No, I'll get Lady Muck to bring over a few bits and pieces.

45
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,100
她不会介意的
She won't mind.

46
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,050
西莉亚...      怎么了?
Celia...        What?

47
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:07,980
我想...我能不能...
I just... Can I just...

48
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,480
怎么了 亲爱的
What, love?

49
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:12,040

谢谢你让他这么开心
Thank you for making him so happy

52
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:18,280
谢谢你把他从鬼门关带回来
and thank you for bringing him back.

53
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:22,210
你觉得是吗? 我想是吧
Do you know? I think I did.

54
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:23,930
不 就是你的功劳
No, I know you did.

55
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:25,940
你以后都不许和他吵架了
Now, you mustn't fall out with him again.

56
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:29,150
哦 是他跟我吵架
Oh, well, it was him that fell out with me.

57
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:32,080
嗯 算了 反正你知道我的意思
Yeah, well, whatever. You know what I'm saying.

58
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:35,380
我永远也不会再跟他吵架了
I am never going to fall out with him again.

59
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:37,800
永远 无论什么事
Ever! About anything.

60
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,720
给你们 女士们
There you go, ladies.

61
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,400
你最好了 爱死你了      谢谢你 亲爱的
You're a gem, and a star.        Thanks, love.

62
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,430
我把羊关进棚里了 还做了千层面
I've penned that ewe up on her own in t'barn and I've made a lasagne.

63
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:10,120
要是卡洛琳过来时想吃点的话
There's enough for everybody, if Caroline wants something 

64
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,180
也足够了
when she gets here.

65
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:13,340
你说他怎么表现这么好呢?
Have you any idea how good he's been?

66
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:16,850
是我啊 你在给我收拾箱子吗?
It's ME. Are you packing me that suitcase?

67
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:18,940
箱子我已经收拾好了
I have packed you that suitcase.

68
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:21,590
罗比说给你准备了晚饭等你过来吃
Robbie says he'll have a bit of supper ready for you when you get here, 

69
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:22,400
要是你乐意的话
if you like.

70
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,740
哦 那太好了
'Oh, that's lovely.'

71
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:24,790
帮我谢谢他
Thank you, tell him. 

72
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:26,790
吉莉安说你可以留下过夜
'And Gillian says you're welcome to stop the night,

73
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:29,560
要是你不想直接开回去的话
'if you don't fancy turning round and driving straight back.'

74
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,210
好啊 为什么不呢?
OK. Great. Why not?

75
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:34,070
那我们待会见
So we'll see you in a bit.

76
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:36,200
好的 拜      开车当心
Yeah, bye.        'Drive carefully.'

77
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,390
好的 拜拜
Yeah, I will. Bye-bye.

78
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:42,090
要不我去给她送吧?      你?
Why don't I pop over with her bits and pieces?        You?

79
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:43,410
能给你省点时间...
Well, it'll save you time and... 

80
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:45,350
如果你想帮忙的话 你能做的就是
The best thing you can do, if you want to be useful,

81
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:48,500
留下来陪孩子们 因为我可能会在那边过夜
is stay here with the boys cos I might stay over there.

82
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:51,710
为什么?      就住今天一晚 为什么不呢?
Why?         Well, just tonight. Why not?

83
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:54,690
他们已经够大了...不如我跟你一起去吧?
They're old enough to... why don't I come with you?

84
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,890
跟我去...干什么?
Come... What for?

85
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:01,050
去跟大家道歉...
Well, so I can apologise to everyone for...

86
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:04,510
是我的错 不是吗?      怎么这么说?
Well, it was all my fault, wasn't it?        How?

87
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:07,750
要是我没跟西莉亚说你是...
Well, if I hadn't told Celia about you being...

88
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,540
然后她的反应不是这么强烈的话
And then if she hadn't reacted so badly to that,

89
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:15,780
艾伦就不会看到她狭隘顽固的一面
Alan wouldn't have seen how small-minded and bigoted she...can be

90
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:18,460
要是他们没有因为这个吵架
and then if they hadn't fallen out about that,

91
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:21,970
他就不会伤心 然后就...就...就...
he might not have got upset and had...had...had the...

92
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:24,190
犯了心脏病
the heart attack.

93
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:27,960
可说到底都是你的事 对不对?
But it really is all about you, isn't it?

94
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,280
这...这是...
That's... That's just...

95
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,230
等我回来 我们真的需要搞明白到底是怎么回事
When I get back, we really do need to work out what's what

96
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:34,910
应该怎么办 所有一切问题
and whose is what and all the rest of it.

97
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,390
孩子们
Boys!

98
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:40,560

00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:45,270
爸爸留在这儿
Dad's going to be here.

100
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:49,630

111

那我们今晚没什么安排了是吗?
So, we're not doing anything tonight, then?

112
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:14,110
我们的事还没说完 是不是?
Well, we left it up in the air, didn't we?

113
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,460
这样可以吗?
So, is that all right?

114
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:21,220
嗯 嗯 嗯 当然了

I was watching you. You and your wife.

You're just so completely in love with each other, aren't you?

122
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:49,080
她还不是我妻子
She's not my wife yet.

123
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,640
我可想我们得把事情办完
But I do think we need to get on with it.

124

Why? Have you got plans?

爱丽
Ellie.

130
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:05,530
谁?      女朋友
Who?        Girlfriend.        

131
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:07,000
她不是我女朋友
She's not my girlfriend.

132
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,610
她还是玩弄你于股掌之间啊
She running rings round you again?

133
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:10,750
她不是那样的人      那她什么样?
She's not like that.        What is she like?

134
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,290
她的确忽冷忽热的
She does blow hot and cold.

135
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:14,040
<font color="#4096d1">(约翰手机)</font> 哦 这可不行
Oh, you don't want that.

136
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,340
人生苦短啊
Life's too short. 

137
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:16,670
我们只是朋友
We're just mates.

138
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:18,510
她在利用你      她没利用我
She uses you.        She doesn't use me.

139
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:20,650
她就是利用你      就一次
She damn well does!        Once.

140
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:22,340
发生什么了?      没什么
What happened?        Nothing.

141
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:24,160
他们约过一次会      "约会"
They had a date.        "Date."

142
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,520
但是她为了别人爽了他的约
Only she stood him up cos she got a better offer.

143
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,850
是啊 很不错 贱人
Yeah, nice Bitch.

144
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:30,810
不是这么一回事      就是
That ain't what happened.        Is.

145
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:32,710
那你会说是怎么一回事
How would you describe it?

146
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:34,760
我还是管好自己的事吧
Well, I'd be minding me own business.

147
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:38,150
约翰? 他想干嘛?
John? What's he want?

148
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:42,480
喂?      西莉亚 嗨
Hello?        'Celia! Hi.'

149
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,770
什么事?
'What's up?'

150
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:47,520
就是打来告诉你卡洛琳已经走了 就刚才
Just ringing to let you know that Caroline's just set off, just now.

151
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:49,340
好
Right.

152
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:51,840
可能再有一小时 一个半小时就到你那儿了
Probably be with you in an hour, an hour and a half.

153
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,830
好      他怎么样?
Right.        'How is he?'

154
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,080
艾伦
Alan?

155
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:58,760
嗯 现在说还太早 总之他清醒了
'Well, it's early days, but he's conscious anyway.

156
00:08:58,770 --> 00:08:59,990
她没告诉你吗?
'Didn't she tell you?'

157
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:02,070
那就好 她说了
Good. Yes! She did.

158
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:06,750
那个...我能不能...吉莉安在吗?
Is...? Could I...? Is Gillian there?

159
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:09,990
吉莉安? 嗯 她在 还有拉弗和罗比
Gillian? Yes, she's here, and Raff and Robbie.

160
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:13,280
我能...我能跟她说话吗?      吉莉安?
Could I...? Could I speak to her?        'Gillian?'

161
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,290
是的      什么事?
Yes.        'What for?'

162
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:17,620
我就是...就是...
'Well, just...just...'

163
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:20,340
是约翰 他要跟你说话
It's John. He's asking to speak to you.

164
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:23,330
说什么?
What about?

165
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:26,650
喂?
Hello?

166
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:28,730
吉莉安      是我

167
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:30,170

嗨      嗯?
Hi.        Yes?

170
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:37,790

'Look... Sorry. I realise you're cross with me.'

171
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:39,300
是吗?
Am I?

172
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,130
嗯 不是吗?
Yeah. Aren't you?

173
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:42,560
因为我喝醉了大惊小怪
'For getting drunk and making a fuss

174
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,260
把卡洛琳的事说给西莉亚听 还有...
'and spilling the beans about Caroline to Celia and...'

175
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:46,200
哦
Oh!

176
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,190
...等等的事
..so forth.

177
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:49,740
事情都过去了 所以...
Well, it's all water under t'bridge now, so...

178
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:51,350
那就好 那就好 是这样吗?
'Good. Good. Is it?'

179
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:52,660
过去的事就忘了它吧
Gone and forgotten.

180
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:55,080
好 好 那就好
Good. Good. Well, that's good.

181
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,240
那拜拜了
Bye, then.

182
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,920
不 等等
No. Wait.

183
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:01,450
还有一件事
Then, there's the other thing.

184
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,210
还有一件事?
The other thing?

185
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:08,150
我们能...我想再见你
'Could we...? I'd like to see you again.'

186
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:10,870
嗯 这...这不行...
Right. Well, that's... That's not...

187
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,190
问题是 哦天啊
The thing is. Oh, God.

188
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,690
喂?
Hello?

189
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:19,300
我想我有点爱上你了
I think I'm a little bit in love with you.

190
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:24,030
嗯 嗯 好吧
Right. Right. OK.

191
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:30,820
这...这不是我的问题 对吧?
Well. That's...not exactly my problem as such, is it?

192
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,210
很明显 你说话不方便
You can't talk. Obviously.

193
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:36,050
是的
And there is that.

194
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,320
也许...我们能...见个面?
'Maybe... Could we...meet up?

195
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,420
找个地方 找个时间?      不行
'Somewhere? Sometime?'        No.

196
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:43,960
我可以过去啊
I don't mind popping over.

197
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:47,860
你收到我信息了吧?      别拒绝我
Did you get my text message?        Please don't say no.

198
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:48,710
我想我不能...
I don't think I could...

199
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:51,240
好 那我再给西莉亚说?
OK, so shall I give you back to Celia?

200
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,790
不 不 我不要再跟西莉亚说话了
'No. No. I don't need to speak to Celia again.'

201
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:56,010
不要吗 好 那就再见了
No, OK. Ta-ta, then.

202
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:58,740
吉莉安 吉莉安 我...
Gillian. Gillian. This is...

203
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:00,880
我爸爸在医院 约翰
My dad's in hospital, John.

204
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:04,100
我们现在有很多事
We've got a lot on just now at this end.

205
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,690
当然了 当然了
Of course. Course you do.

206
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:07,760
抱歉 但是我...
Sorry. Sure. It's just...

207
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,010
孩子们都好吗?
'Boys all right?'

208
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,730
孩子们都很好
boys are fine.

209
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:13,600
好 拜
OK. Bye!

210
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,010
拜拜 拜拜
Bye. Bye! Bye-bye.

211
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:29,780
爸爸 晚饭吃什么      什么也没有
Dad! What's for tea?        Nothing.

212
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:31,710
我不知道
I don't know.

213
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:50,340
嗨 朱蒂丝 是我 你今晚有事吗?
Hi, Judith. It's me. Are you doing anything this evening?

214
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:54,590
医生说我周一就可以回家了
He said I can come home on Monday, the doctor,

215
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:56,750
如果一切顺利的话
all things being equal.

216
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,810
那...太好了
That's...amazing.

217
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,250
他还说什么了?
What else has he said?

218
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:06,200
哦...一些注意事项      比如什么?
Oh...a few dos and don'ts.        Like?

219
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:11,560
跟往常一样      不 告诉我
Usual.        No, come on.

220
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,770
不能享受生活
No enjoying yourself. 

221
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:17,190
不能唱歌 不能跳舞 不能打架 不能放屁
No singing, no dancing, no fighting, no farting.

222
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,520
药换了吗?
Different pills?

223
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,460
不 没换 还是一样
No, no. The same.

224
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:25,490
他跟我说还有点...
He told me there'd been...

225
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,000
肌肉损伤
damage to the muscle.

226
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,100
是啊 它自己..自己就好了
Yeah. Well, it's...sorted itself out.

227
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:37,350
我会再去找医生谈一下 爸爸
I will be talking to the consultant myself again, Dad,

228
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:39,900
我怕你会瞒着我们
in case you were thinking about trying to pull the wool over anyone's eyes 

229
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:42,050
不说实话
with your medical rhetoric.

230
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,590
不如你带上卡洛琳
Why don't you take Caroline 

231
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:47,170
看看能不能找到地方喝杯茶?
and see if you can't find a cup of tea somewhere?

232
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:51,250
好主意 等下见了
Good plan. We'll see you in a bit, then.

233
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,480
见到你很高兴
It is nice to see you.

234
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,730
见到你我也很高兴 亲爱的
Yeah, it's nice to see you as well, love.

235
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,000
他们有蛋糕
They do cake.

236
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,620
我一直在想      嗯 我也在想
I've been thinking.        Yeah, so have I.

237
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:13,910
我们要不要...
Happen we should...        

238
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:15,850
直接举行好了 我们的婚礼
Just get on with it, the wedding.

239
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:18,450
好主意 抛开所有实际问题...
Great minds. Bugger the practicalities...

240
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:20,800
比如我们要住哪儿 我们就...
Like where we might live. Let's just...

241
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,530
找一个登记员 直接注册
Book a registrar and get on with it 

242
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:25,050
然后再考虑其他事
and worry about everything else afterwards.

243
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:27,550
你觉得呢? 找一个会场?
What do you think? What about a venue?

244
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:31,160
我不知道 我不在乎      我也是
I don't know, I don't care.        Neither do I.

245
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:35,850
我们可以在酒吧的停车场上举行婚礼
We can get married in the car park at The Dog & Duck for all I care.

246
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:40,120
还有...事情办好之前谁也不告诉
And...not tell anyone till it's all over and done with.

247
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,280
谁也不说?
Anyone?

248
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,220
谁也不说
Anyone.

249
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:47,370
那就可以很轻松地躲开伴郎问题了
Well, that'll get round the best man issue very nicely.

250
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:49,220
我们不需要见证人吗?
Won't we need witnesses?

251
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:51,120
会有路过的人的
There'll be folk passing.

252
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,690
我觉得这样很好
It's appealing to me.

253
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:54,370
是啊 我知道
Yes, I can see.

254
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:57,640
医生是怎么说的?
What did the consultant say?

255
00:13:57,650 --> 00:13:59,690
跟我说的一样
Just what I've said.

256
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,460
怎么从男人嘴里问点话
Why is it that trying to get information out of a man

257
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:05,180
就像让石头流血那么难
is like trying to get blood out of a stone?

258
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:06,790
我健康得不得了
I'm A1.

259
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:10,700
不  你不是 你刚犯过心脏病
Oh, you're not A1, you've had a heart attack.

260
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,840
我健康得不得了
I'm A1.

261
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:19,170
我觉得我听说艾伦出事
I think I was more upset when I heard about Alan

262
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:21,090
比听说我爸爸去世还要难过
than I was when my dad died.

263
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:23,440
天 这么说真是不好
God, that's an awful thing to say. 

264
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,500
不过他得了痴呆症 我爸爸
Except he had dementia, my dad.

265
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,370
所以某种意义上...
So in some ways...      

266
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:27,330
也算...一种解脱      嗯 嗯
it was...a relief.        Yeah Yeah

267
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:31,910
你觉得人会因为心碎而死吗?
Do you think people can die from a broken heart?

268
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:37,000
我觉得就是这么一回事
I thought that was what was happening.

269
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:42,810
当然我不会跟医生说 他肯定会笑我
Course I couldn't say that to t'consultant. He'd have laughed,

270
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:46,570
或者用那种很同情的眼神看你
or given you that look they do where they feel sorry for you,

271
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:47,860
觉得你很傻
for being thick.

272
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,240
你可能没被这样看过
You've probably never had that.

273
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,530
凯特怎么样?
How's Kate?

274
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:56,290
嗯 她...她...
Yeah, she's... She's...

275
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,180
怎么?      好像...
What?        It's all...

276
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:06,960
大家一下子都知道了 我没想这样
Like everybody suddenly knows and I didn't want it to be like that.

277
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:10,230
我是说 我觉得我们还不清楚两个人的关系
I mean, I don't think we know what we are yet exactly.

278
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:12,070
然后大家都眼巴巴看着你
And everybody's gawping at you 

279
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:14,090
好像期待你宣布什么决定一样
like they're expecting you to make an announcement.

280
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:16,760
就是这样      别管他们 让他们走开
Exactly that.        Sod 'em. Let 'em deal with it.

281
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:22,400
嗯 是啊
Yeah. Yeah.

282
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:31,150
我要告诉你一件事
I need to tell you this thing.

283
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,690
好
OK.

284
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:38,710
说了之后你可能会觉得我是个彻头彻尾的笨蛋
You'll probably think I'm a complete dipstick when I've told you,

285
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:41,900
可我宁愿坦白说出来 让你知道
but I'd rather be upfront about it and then you know,

286
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:46,490
然后我们可以把它放下 或者不放下
and then we can either move forward or not.

287
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,200
好 首先...
OK. So, first of all...

288
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:52,960
我不后悔
I don't regret it. 

289
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:53,840
我不为任何事不后悔
I don't regret anything, 

290
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:56,120
后悔没有任何意义
I make a point of not regretting things.

291
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:01,480
但是...      你跟约翰上床了
However...        You've slept with John.

292
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:06,700
我喝醉了
I was pissed.

293
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,300
那天是我生日
It was my birthday. 

294
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:12,190
我同情他 同情他是这么一个...混球
I felt sorry for him, for being such a...twat, 

295
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:13,770
他看起来那么可怜
he looked so pathetic.

296
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,920
哦 你真的和约翰上床了?
Oh, you really have slept with John?

297
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:29,120
怎么样啊?
What was it like?

298
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:33,230
说实话...
To be honest...

299
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:39,750
...我不怎么记得了 只记得有过这件事
..I don't actually remember very much about it, except that it happened.

300
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:42,630
好
Right.

301
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:46,960
你...恨我吗?
Are you...hating me?

302
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:49,390
不
No.

303
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:54,620
我不希望你从别人那里听说
I didn't want you to find out later from someone else 

304
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:57,190
然后认为还有除此之外的其他什么
and think there was any more to it than there was,

305
00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:58,510
因为根本没有 真的没有
because there wasn't, there really wasn't.

306
00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:00,820
这件事是那种你做了之后会想
It was one of those things you do and after you go,

307
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,220
天啊 我为什么要这么做
"God, why did I do that?!"

308
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:04,870
事实就是...
And the truth is...

309
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:09,530
...我喝醉了
..I was pissed.

310
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:12,140
我甚至都不喜欢他
I don't even fancy him.

311
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:15,470
我是说 你知道 我不讨厌他...
I mean, you know, I don't mind him, but...

312
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:21,550
哦 看你的表情来看 我希望事情
Oh, I'm daring to hope that this isn't going down too badly judging

313
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:23,880
不会太糟糕
by the expression on your face.

314
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:25,840
你跟我说了我很高兴
I'm pleased you told me.        

315
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:26,870
这种事不会再发生了
It won't happen again.

316
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:28,660
不 不...你可以跟他在一起
No, no...you can have him.        

317
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:29,540
我不想要他
I don't want him.

318
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:31,610
他赚得很多      我不在乎
He's got a good income.        I don't care.

319
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:37,720
你恨我吗?      不
Do you hate me?        No.

320
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,990
你是在笑我还是跟我一起笑?
Are you laughing at me or with me?

321
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:43,190
我不知道 我只是...
I don't know, I'm just...

322
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:46,180
我...我不知道 我只是在笑
I'm... I don't know, just laughing.

323
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:51,670
你在想 "下流脑残的垃圾货"是不是?
You're thinking, "Braindead, low-life, trailer trash," aren't you?

324
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:53,010
对
Yeah.

325
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,950
但那是因为我是个不要脸的贱人
But that's cos I'm a snotty bitch.

326
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:02,110
你能这么平静真是太好了
It's good that you're taking it so well.

327
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:03,830
也许你太吃惊了
Maybe you're in shock. 

328
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:06,700
也许你还没意识到事情的严重性
Maybe the implications haven't sunk in yet.

329
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,930
有严重吗?
Are there any?

330
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,200
你没怀孕吧?
You're not pregnant, are you?

331
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:15,370
没有! 那样的话事情可就复杂了
No! That really would thicken the plot.

332
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,440
那...
So, um...

333
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:25,570
...什么时候的事?
..when was this?

334
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:29,470
你妈妈和我爸爸开车回哈罗盖特那晚
Night me dad and your mum drove back over to Harrogate.

335
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:33,900
当时他 你知道 约翰把你的事告诉了她
When he'd, you know, John had spilled the beans to her about you.

336
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:35,390
我们的生日
Our birthday.

337
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,990
天      没错
God.        Right.

338
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:43,240
当时我在急诊室陪着朱蒂丝
When I was propping Judith up in casualty.

339
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,140
是吗?
Were you?

340
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:47,680
好吧
Blimey.

341
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:53,610
"我们没事吧 文森特?"
"Are we cool, Vincent?"

342
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:58,190
这句话出自哪里吗?
Is that from something?

343
00:18:58,190 --> 00:18:59,700
"低俗小说"
Pulp Fiction.

344
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:05,460
我是塞缪尔・杰克逊 你是约翰・特拉沃尔塔
I'm Samuel L Jackson and you're John Travolta.

345
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:08,850
嗯
Right.

346
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,140
然后我们出去打死了几个学生 我想是
Then we go out and shoot some students, I think.

347
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:14,830
除非我记错了
Unless I've misremembered.

348
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:20,220
好吧
Blimey.

349
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,770
我老是忍不住想要是他没挺过来
I can't help thinking how different things would've been now

350
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:33,060
那会怎么样      哦 西莉亚 
if he hadn't pulled through.        Oh, Celia!

351
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:36,350
你现在就别想这个了 好吗?
Well, you don't need to think about that now, do you?

352
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:39,550
你们俩对我来说非常重要
I think the world of you two.

353
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:42,280
这点你俩都知道 是吧?      哦
You both know that, don't you?        Aww!

354
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,490
我去把水烧上
I'll get t'kettle on.

355
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:12,170
那个腿瘸了的小子 叫什么来着 他去哪儿了?
Where's little what's-his-name with the broken leg?

356
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:17,430
保罗? 我让他走人了 把他送到他奶奶家了
Paul? I got shot of him. I took him to his granny's.

357
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:19,610
坐吧 暖和暖和
Sit down, get warm.

358
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:26,140
我可能要回家去 妈妈
I might get back off home, Mum.

359
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:27,580
哦 你不是要住一晚吗
Oh, I thought you were stopping.

360
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:29,400
我让约翰留在家里陪孩子们了
I've left John at home with the boys, 

361
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,210
但是我不太愿意这样
which I'm not thrilled about.

362
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:34,270
我不想让他觉得我离不开他 因为我没有
I don't want him to think I need him for anything, because I don't.

363
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:36,560
他之前打过电话 约翰 我不知道为啥
He rang earlier, John. I don't know why.

364
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:40,720
哦 说你出发了 听起来像借口
Oh, to say you'd set off. Seemed like an excuse.

365
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:43,330
他要跟吉莉安说话来着 不知道为啥
He asked to speak to Gillian. I don't know why.

366
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:45,710
我在想
I've been thinking.

367
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:49,940
要是他出院后 我们住在我的小公寓里
How would you feel if, when he comes out of hospital,

368
00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:52,910
你怎么想?
we came to live at my little flat?

369
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:55,370
我觉得可以啊      问题是
I'd feel fine about it.        You see, the thing is,

370
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:59,730
你知道我爸爸死于心脏病 爬楼梯的时候
you know my dad died of a heart attack, climbing the stairs.

371
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:02,870
医生告诉他不要爬了 但是我妈妈说
The doctor told him not to and my mother, of course, said,

372
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:06,410
"哦 你不会有事的" 然后事情就发生了
"Oh, you'll be all right," and that was it.

373
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:08,750
他不想和她争执
He'd not want to contradict her.

374
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:12,070
他去世时脸和床单一样白
He went as white as a sheet.

375
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:16,180
妈妈 那是你家 我绝对不会反对
Mum, it's your home. It's absolutely fine by me.

376
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,830
吉莉安怎么想?
What does Gillian think?

377
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:22,970
你看 我家没楼梯 这里除了楼梯就是楼梯
See, I've no stairs, and it's nothing but stairs here,

378
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:25,520
还是很陡的楼梯
and steep ones at that.

379
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,590
好
OK.

380
00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:30,840
我连他都没说呢 更别说吉莉安了
I've not broached him with it yet, never mind Gillian.

381
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:33,280
他可能有其他想法      好
He might have other ideas.        OK.

382
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:36,360
好
Right.

383
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:39,040
大家都够暖和吧?
Is everybody warm enough?

384
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:42,830
我要..回家了
I'm going to...get, er...going.

385
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,080
好的
OK.

386
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:48,010
我有一堆文件要处理 然后...
I've a pile of paperwork to get through and...

387
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:50,250
有需要给我打电话
Ring me if you want anything.

388
00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:53,700
我送你...好的      我送你
I'll see you...Sure        I'll see you out...

389
00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:58,950
再见      再见
See you.        See ya.

390
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:07,240
你没事吧?      嗯
Are you all right?        Yeah.

391
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:13,230
你和吉莉安有什么事吗?
Is there something up between you and Gillian?

392
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:19,500
她和约翰上床了
She slept with John.

393
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,510
她刚跟我说的
She just told me. 

394
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:25,940
那天晚上 我的生日 也是她生日
That night, my birthday, her birthday,

395
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:28,810
他来这里大放厥词的时候
when he was over here shooting his mouth off.

396
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:32,370
你和艾伦去哈罗盖特了
You and Alan set off over to Harrogate, 

397
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:38,230
我在送朱蒂丝去急诊室 他们就睡在一起了
I was propping Judith up in casualty and they ended up in bed together.

398
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,770
我是说 她跟我说了 因为她感觉很糟糕
I mean, she's told me cos she feels bad about it

399
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:44,080
她当时喝醉了 希望这一切没发生 但是...
and she was drunk and she wishes it hadn't happened, but...

400
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:49,640
我不知道 怎么会有这样的人?
I don't know. How do people do that?

401
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:53,440
怎么每件事都这么随便和没意义...?
Why is everything so casual and meaningless and...?

402
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,310
我不能走 我得陪他
I can't leave. I need to be near him.

403
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,860
不 我不是...
No, I didn't...

404
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:01,320
我知道 我没想让你走
I know that, I don't expect you to.

405
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:03,280
我只是...对不起
I was... Sorry, 

406
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:05,480
我想我只是有点吃惊吧 没别的
I just think I'm a little bit shocked, that's all.

407
00:23:05,810 --> 00:23:08,030
什么都别说      好
Don't say anything.        No.

408
00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:12,960
你觉得在朱蒂丝之前 约翰有没有...?
Do you think before Judith, John was...?

409
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,150
跟各色女人鬼混?
At it with all and sundry?

410
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:17,990
像你爸爸那样?
Like your dad?

411
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:21,610
我不知道 亲爱的
I don't know, love.

412
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:28,060
给我打电话      好
Ring me.        Yes.

413
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,090
什么都别说
Don't say anything.

414
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:32,620
好 别担心
No, don't worry.

415
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:04,640
没什么事吧?      嗯
Everything all right?        Hmm.

416
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:09,570
我想我先回房间了 可以吗?      当然了
I thought I might turn in early, if it's all right?        Sure.

417
00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:12,670
当然了 你...去忙你的事吧
Course. You... do what you need to do.

418
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,090
给我的?      嗯
That for me?        Yeah.

419
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:17,870
我能不能...?
Is it all right if I...?

420
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:20,430
好的
Course.

421
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,520
晚安 亲爱的
Night-night, love.

422
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,040
晚安
Night-night.

423
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,120
巴特萧先生 准备好了吗?
Ready, Mr Buttershaw?

424
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:13,390
我早晨六点就准备好了
I've been ready since six o'clock this morning.

425
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:16,800
你疯了吗? 别这么坐着 穿上大衣
Have you heck?! Not sat there, in your coat.

426
00:25:17,810 --> 00:25:21,410
说到底 这又不是你第一次让我等了
Still, wouldn't be the first time you'd kept me waiting.

427
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:26,870
这件事你是永远都要念个不停了 是吧?
You're never going to let that drop, are you? 

428
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:30,780
有天会停啊 要是你足够乖的话
I might do one day, if you play your cards right.

429
00:25:58,450 --> 00:26:00,620
我下了决心 第一次发病后 
I resolved, the first time it happened, 

430
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:04,990
决心要换个活法 总得来说 我确实做到了
that I was going to live life differently and I did, on the whole.

431
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:10,340
比如我跟你联系上了 是不是? 可现在...
I got in touch with you, didn't I, for instance? But now...

432
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:16,070
现在你要一切慢慢来       不 天啊 不
Now you're going to take things steady.        No. God, no.

433
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:18,740
现在我要真正开始我的人生
Now I'm going to really start living.

434
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:21,980
你觉得我坐在这儿是干什么?
What do you think I'm doing sat up here?

435
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:26,630
你知道医生刚才说了什么      哦 不管他
Well, you know what the consultant just said.        Oh, bugger that.

436
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:30,820
好吧 那你想做什么?
OK. So what've you got planned?

437
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:34,650
什么都行 任何事      比如呢
Anything. All sorts.        Such as?

438
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:40,300
你有没有想过去滑雪?      没有 你呢?
Have you ever fancied skiing?        No. Have you?

439
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:44,560
哦 你啊
Oh, you!

440
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:46,640
从来没有      很好
Never!        Good.

441
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,390
那这件可以放在一边了
Well, that's that dealt with, then.

442
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:52,380
我们以前经常骑车上来
We used to come up here on bikes.

443
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:57,160
我和莫里斯 哈利还有莱利
Me and Maurice and Harry and Joe Riley.

444
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,770
你可以从巴基斯兰德的山顶
You could get all t'way to Greetland 

445
00:26:58,770 --> 00:27:02,150
一路骑到格里特兰 一下都不用蹬
from top o' Barkisland without pedalling once.

446
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:04,140
我知道你可以 因为...
I know you could because...        

447
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,500
就像在云中漫步一样
It were like floating through the air.

448
00:27:06,530 --> 00:27:09,700
因为我 艾琳和道芮・威奇森
Because me and Eileen and Doreen Wilkinson

449
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:12,220
还有穆里尔也这么干过
and our Muriel used to do just the same.

450
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:14,230
是吗?       是啊是啊
Did you?         Yeah,yeah.

451
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:18,730
我那时一直觉得你有点喜欢乔・莱利
I always used to think you were a bit smitten with Joe Riley.

452
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,510
乔?
Joe?!

453
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:23,770
没有 虽然他是挺帅的
No. Although he was very good-looking.

454
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:27,750
我一直觉得他长得像埃罗尔・弗林 但是更聪明
I always thought he had a look of Errol Flynn, but clever.

455
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:30,300
他去美国宇航局工作了 是吗?      是的
He went to work for NASA, didn't he?        He did!

456
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:33,240
他加入了皇家学会
He were made a Fellow of the Royal Society, 

457
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:35,680
然后就去了加利福尼亚的阿尔塔迪纳
then off he went to Altadena, California.

458
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:40,020
人才流失啊 他是我的伴郎...
Brain drain. He were my best man...

459
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:45,200
我和艾琳结婚时      哦 你们有联系吗?
when Eileen and I got wed.        Oh. Do you keep in touch?

460
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:51,320
有啊 每年圣诞节 中间还有偶尔写信
We did. Every Christmas, and the occasional letter in-between.

461
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:56,530
他回来看过他妈妈一两次 我们一直有联系
He popped over once or twice to see his mother, but we always caught up.

462
00:27:57,090 --> 00:28:00,950
我总是想去那边 可是没成行过
I always fancied popping over there, but it never happened.

463
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:05,360
他最后得帕金森死了
He had Parkinson's at finish.

464
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:13,380
我们在这里撒的我爸爸骨灰 我和我妈妈
We came up here to scatter my dad's ashes, me and me mum.

465
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:18,330
我们从谢菲尔德开车过来 卡洛琳还坐着推车
We drove over from Sheffield and we had Caroline in the pushchair.

466
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,670
1969年
1969.

467
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:25,480
他喜欢这上面 我爸爸
He loved up here, me dad.

468
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,360
结果搞得滑稽
It was a right farce.

469
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:31,370
我们以为骨灰是粉末状的 可是不是
We thought it would be like powder, but it wasn't,

470
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:36,830
更像是沙砾 颗粒 弄得到处都是
it was more like grit, granules, and it got everywhere.

471
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:40,080
我们没办法弄掉它 他
We just couldn't get rid of it. Him.

472
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:44,740
我们都没仔细想过 她没想过 我妈妈
We hadn't thought it through. Well, she hadn't, me mother.

473
00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:50,380
也没得到任何许可 我们不知道还需要许可
And we hadn't got permission. Well, we didn't know you needed it.

474
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:53,040
也许不需要吧 我不知道
Perhaps you didn't then. I don't know.

475
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:59,220
我不知道我爸妈对咱俩的事会怎么想
I don't know what my mum and dad would've thought about me and you.

476
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:04,680
其实我知道 他们一定高兴极了
Actually, I do. They'd have been over the moon.

477
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:07,090
跟你在一起他们一定会乐开花
They'd have been thrilled to bits with you.

478
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,750
你想不想喝一杯?
Do you fancy a pint?

479
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,590
现在才十一点半
It's only just gone half-past 11!

480
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:17,640
你出院才半小时
You've only been out of hospital half an hour!

481
00:29:17,650 --> 00:29:20,960
那又怎么样?      你知道怎么样
So what?        You know damn well so what.

482
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:26,780
那你想不想先去登记处啊?
Do you fancy popping over to the Registry Office first, then?

483
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:31,610
我们真的要这样吗 谁也不告诉
Are we serious, about not telling anyone

484
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:33,860
直到生米煮成熟饭?
till it's all over and done with? 

485
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,910
嗯 我是想这样没错
Well, I am, yeah.

486
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:19,830
两星期后的明天 上午十一点
So that's a fortnight tomorrow at 11am.

487
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,850
我给你们写在卡片上吧?
Shall I put that on a card for you?

488
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:32,750
<font color="#4096d1">婚礼预约卡 阿兰・巴特萧和西莉亚・道森</font>

489
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:57,020
感谢你给我发信息了啊
Well, it's a good job you texted me

490
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:58,900
不然我就不知道你去哪儿了
or I'd have been wondering where you were.

491
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:03,610
刚出院就到处乱逛这样好吗?
Is it wise to go gallivanting when you've only just been discharged?

492
00:31:03,610 --> 00:31:05,980
我只是想去看看格莱斯顿岩
I just wanted to see Ladstone Rock 

493
00:31:06,610 --> 00:31:08,400
然后我们去喝了一杯
and then we fancied a pint.

494
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:12,550
哦 莫非你们是从苏格兰开过去的?      没错
Oh, so you went via Aberdeen?        That's right.

495
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:14,600
你们订好日子了吗?
Have you set a date?

496
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,590
什么?      婚礼日期呀
Sorry?        For the wedding?

497
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:19,330
哦 没有 亲爱的 没有
Oh, no, love. No.

498
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:23,150
艾伦要先好好恢复一下身体
Alan needs to concentrate on getting fit again first

499
00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:25,720
然后我们再考虑这些事
before we start thinking of anything like that.

500
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:26,730
我们把水烧上吧?
Shall we get t'kettle on?

501
00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:30,590
然后我和西莉亚有事跟你说
And then me and Celia have got something to run past you.

502
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:38,580
哈罗盖特?      我那儿没楼梯
Harrogate?        I've no stairs.

503
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:42,500
你又一整天都在农场里 或者在店里
And you're out on the farm all day, or down at the shop,

504
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:45,010
我却可以一天二十四小时陪着他
whereas I can see to him 24/7.

505
00:31:45,050 --> 00:31:46,820
我是这么想的
That's what I'm thinking.

506
00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:50,200
谢谢你这么做 但是...
Well, that's very kind of you, but...

507
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,240
也不是一直住下去了
And it's not like it's for ever.

508
00:31:52,290 --> 00:31:56,330
我是说 我们最后还是要买房子
I mean, we do intend to buy. Eventually.

509
00:31:56,330 --> 00:31:58,490
好吧      而且很快
OK.        And soon.

510
00:31:58,510 --> 00:32:02,010
买的时候 还是比较可能买在这边的
And when we do, it'll more than likely be round here.

511
00:32:02,050 --> 00:32:03,780
这个我们还没谈论
Well, we've not discussed that yet.

512
00:32:03,810 --> 00:32:05,230
还没 可是...
No, no, but...

513
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:08,650
哈罗盖特又不是一百英里远 对吧?
And it's not a million miles away, Harrogate, is it?

514
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:11,230
嗯 但是...
No, it's not but...

515
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:15,610
我们随时欢迎你过来
And you'd be more than welcome, any time you fancied, to pop over.

516
00:32:15,610 --> 00:32:20,380
那边很好 大房子和西莉亚的小公寓
It is very nice, the house and Celia's little flat.

517
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:23,430
肯定很好 爸爸 我只是...
I'm sure it is, Dad. I just...

518
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:28,450
那你们想什么时候...
So when were you thinking of...

519
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,520
明天
Tomorrow.

520
00:32:31,530 --> 00:32:35,030
明天? 卡洛琳知道吗?
Tomorrow? Does Caroline know...?

521
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:37,400
她没问题
She's fine about it.

522
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:38,760
我知道了
I see.

523
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:41,540
嗯...
So...

524
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:45,300
只是有点突然
Well, it just seems a bit sudden.

525
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:49,120
可是...好吧 
But... Well, yeah,

526
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,050
如果你想这样的话
if it's what you want.

527
00:32:50,050 --> 00:32:53,080
我想这样一来你就不用操心了
I thought it'd be a weight off your mind.

528
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:54,550
你以后离我有六十英里远了
You'll be 60 miles away.

529
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:58,240
哦 没有 也就四十英里吧
Oh, no. It's actually more like 40.

530
00:32:58,270 --> 00:32:59,730
四十 六十
40, 60.

531
00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:02,250
我会好好照顾他的
He'll be in good hands.

532
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:04,630
嗯 我明白 西莉亚
Yeah, I understand that, Celia.

533
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,840
你就当我是去度假了
You'll have to pretend I'm on holiday.

534
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:10,560
好
Right.

535
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:12,880
不过...
But...

536
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:16,060
我跟你们去怎么样?
how about if I popped over with you?

537
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,720
就去一趟 就明天 只是想确保你...
Just quickly, just tomorrow, just to make sure you're...        

538
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:19,610
嗯
Yeah.

539
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:21,530
...一切都安顿好...
..settled in all right and everything's...

540
00:33:21,530 --> 00:33:22,770
当然了
Sure.

541
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:29,050
好 我去烧水
Right. I'll get the kettle on.

542
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:36,490
我买了顶新帽子
I've got my new hat.

543
00:33:36,490 --> 00:33:38,950
这样这一项就有了
So that's that bit covered.

544
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:42,250
一件旧东西 一件新东西...
Something old, something new...

545
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:44,330
旧的我们已经有了
Something old we've not got.

546
00:33:44,330 --> 00:33:46,320
我们都是又老又旧的
Well, we're both old.

547
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:50,720
是吗?      你是 我可不是
Are we?        Well, you are, I'm not.

548
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:55,940
我从36岁起就开始逆生长了
I started counting backwards when I got to 36.

549
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:58,210
那你现在几岁了?
So how old does that make you now then?

550
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:00,860
负三岁
Minus three.

551
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:02,790
有意思
Fancy.

552
00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:07,400
1988年我们经历很有趣
We had a very interesting experience in 1988,

553
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:11,070
那时我和卡洛琳都是22岁
when me and our Caroline were both 22.

554
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:13,700
解释起来一定很费劲
That must have taken some explaining.

555
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:15,080
也不算是
Not really.

556
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,580
还要一件借来的东西...
Something borrowed...

557
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:22,710
我可以问莫里斯借个领结
I could borrow a bow tie off Maurice. 

558
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:25,300
那样我就衣冠楚楚了
Then I'd be very dapper.

559
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:26,720
行啊去吧
You could and you would, 

560
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:28,820
那他就想知道你为什么借了
but then he'd want to know why you were borrowing it.

561
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:30,400
你知道他有多讨厌
You know what a nosy old bugger he is.

562
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:34,560
我可以撒个谎 我可以说我受邀参加鸡尾酒派对
I could lie. I could say I'd been invited to a cocktail party.

563
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:35,710
在曼哈顿举行的
In Manhattan.

564
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:37,770
嗯 他会信的
Mmm, he'd believe that.

565
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:40,200
除非他想跟我一起去
Only he might want to come with me.

566
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:42,710
叫他滚开      好的
Tell him to sod off.        OK.

567
00:34:43,570 --> 00:34:45,280
还得一样蓝色的东西
Something blue.

568
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:47,930
黄色杂志?
A mucky magazine?

569
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:51,070
你有吗?
Have you got any?

570
00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:53,340
没有 你有吗?
No. Have you?

571
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:56,210
哦 有很多呐
Oh, yeah, got loads.

572
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,700
不 我没有
No, I haven't.

573
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,300
她跟约翰有染
She slept with John.

574
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:58,320
谁?      吉莉安
Who?        Gillian.

575
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:01,500
就是那晚我们驱车赶来
That night when we drove over here,

576
00:36:01,870 --> 00:36:04,860
他在那大骂卡洛琳
and he'd been there shooting his mouth off about Caroline

577
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:06,470
抨击另一方...
batting for the other side...

578
00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:08,140
跟他有染?!
Slept with him?!

579
00:36:08,170 --> 00:36:10,280
跟他...发生了关系
Had...sex with him.

580
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:12,710
你怎么知道的?
How do you know?

581
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,110
卡洛琳告诉我的
Caroline told me.

582
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:16,080
她怎么知道的?
Well, how does she know?

583
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:18,810
显然是吉莉安告诉她的
Gillian. Told her, apparently.

584
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:20,870
为什么?
What for?

585
00:36:21,310 --> 00:36:26,730
因为...我不知道 我想是因为她后悔了吧
Well, because... I don't know. I think because she regretted it.

586
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:33,440
我不知道为什么要告诉你 只是这很困扰我
I don't know why I've told you. Well, except it's bothered me.

587
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:37,070
不好意思 我不想让你担心的
Sorry. I don't want to burden you with it.

588
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,820
这不是...我不是...
It's not... I'm not...

589
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:42,830
我真的只是有点糊涂了
I'm just a bit befuddled with it myself really.

590
00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:48,790
再说了 我也不想看到吉莉安受到伤害 
And plus, I don't want to see her get hurt. Gillian.

591
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:52,910
天呐! 约翰是个混球
God! He's a bugger is John.

592
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,030
吉莉安来了!
Gillian's coming!        

593
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:03,350
吉莉安?      是的!
Gillian?        Yes!

594
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:05,950
凯特来了
And Kate's here.

595
00:37:07,390 --> 00:37:09,320
干嘛...? 吉莉安来这干嘛?
What's...? What's Gillian coming here for?

596
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:12,910
要喝点茶吗?      哦 你好 约翰
Would you like some tea?        Ooh. Hi, John.

597
00:37:13,770 --> 00:37:15,440
吉莉安来这干嘛?
What's Gillian coming here for?

598
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,980
艾伦搬到我妈妈那去休养了
Alan's moving into my mum's to recuperate 

599
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:20,070
我认为她是想让他安顿下来
and I think she wants to see him settled in.

600
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:23,320
那么 她...她会长...住?
So, is...is she staying...long?

601
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:25,190
我不知道 你可以自己去问她
I don't know. You'll have to ask her yourself.

602
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:26,610
哦 还有凯特搬过来了
Oh, and Kate's moving in.

603
00:37:27,930 --> 00:37:29,720
我去把东西搬下车
I'll get my things out of the car.

604
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:31,840
劳伦斯 你能帮凯特搬下东西吗?
Lawrence, can you help Kate with her things?

605
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:34,900
那...你别指望我...
That's... You can't expect me...

606
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:37,720
她自己有家 干嘛要搬来这里?
She's got her own house, what does she want to move in here for?

607
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:40,830
约翰 我周六晚回来就发现了该发现的
John, after I came back here on Saturday night

608
00:37:40,830 --> 00:37:43,780
你竟能总以为自己有权对别人的事指手画脚
and found what I found, I'm amazed you could begin to imagine that

609
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:46,650
我真是服了你这份想象力了
you have anything to say at all about what other people do.

610
00:37:47,090 --> 00:37:49,010
朱蒂丝...      朱蒂丝需要帮助
Judith...        Judith needs help.

611
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:50,380
我和朱蒂丝不是一路的
Judith and I are not an item.        

612
00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:52,210
好啊 你以前还可以糊弄糊弄我!
Well, you could've fooled me!

613
00:37:52,210 --> 00:37:56,420
我不想在自己家也像个见鬼的怨妇
I will not be made to feel like a sodding gooseberry in my own house.

614
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:58,150
那 那 那是...
That-that-that was...        

615
00:37:58,150 --> 00:37:59,810
你没什么好说的了
You have nothing to say.

616
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,750
他们什么时候到这?
What time are they getting here?

617
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:23,470
啊呀
Blimey.

618
00:38:23,990 --> 00:38:26,570
我的小公寓在这后面 吉莉安
My little apartment's round the back, Gillian.

619
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:31,900
你自己在这没问题吧 爸爸?
Done all right for yourself here, Dad, eh?

620
00:38:33,850 --> 00:38:34,650
怎么了?
What's up?

621
00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:36,110
我以为苏珊・贾翠家儿子那件事上
I thought we were plumbing depths 

622
00:38:36,110 --> 00:38:39,180
已经说得够明白了 但是约翰?
with Susan Jatri's lad, but John?

623
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:41,760
他算是你的妹夫
He's practically your brother-in-law.

624
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:42,690
我以为你会告诉我
And I thought you told me 

625
00:38:42,690 --> 00:38:44,490
你和罗比或多或少有点可能?
you and Robbie were more or less an item?

626
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:45,700
怎么...? 谁...?
How did...? Who...?

627
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:49,130
西莉亚告诉我的 卡洛琳告诉她的
Celia told me. Caroline told her.

628
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:49,990
你...
You...        

629
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:52,430
我告诉卡洛琳是因为我对此感到抱歉
I told Caroline because I felt bad about it.

630
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:56,520
我当时喝醉了 那天是我生日 我和罗比...
I was pissed, it was my birthday. Me and Robbie are...

631
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:59,550
我们进去吗?      好的 让我来
Are we going in?        Yeah, let me.

632
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:01,470
我来带路
I'll lead the way.

633
00:39:04,070 --> 00:39:07,680
那说明不了什么 一派胡言 太可笑了
It didn't mean anything. It was rubbish, it was ridiculous.

634
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:09,150
我只是有点可怜他
I just felt sorry for him.

635
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,630
你真是个...
You're a...

636
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:15,580
是什么? 说吧! 别藏着掖着!
What am I? Come on! Don't hold back!

637
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:18,510
...笨蛋!
..a pillock!

638
00:39:18,870 --> 00:39:22,030
哦 好吧 我以为你会说得更坏
Oh, OK. I thought you were going to say something worse.        

639
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:22,870
我本来是要的
I was.

640
00:39:22,870 --> 00:39:24,450
是啊! 随便啦
Yeah! Whatever.

641
00:39:26,010 --> 00:39:27,700
我把我的东西放到你卧室去了
I've put my things in your bedroom.

642
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:30,980
那...?      当然
Is that...?        Of course it is.

643
00:39:31,610 --> 00:39:33,310
这是永久性的?
How permanent is this?

644
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:38,070
我们得坐下来 好好谈谈
We need to sit down and have the conversation properly,

645
00:39:38,070 --> 00:39:39,990
不是我们仓促决定的
and not when we've been rushed into it, 

646
00:39:39,990 --> 00:39:42,450
而是...是的 如果...
but it's... Yeah. If...

647
00:39:43,410 --> 00:39:49,280
如果...是的 如果你愿意的话
If... Yeah. If it's what you want.

648
00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:51,090
这还用问吗?
Do you need to ask?

649
00:39:57,030 --> 00:39:59,380
你好?      我们回来了 已经到了
Hello?        'We're back, we've arrived.'

650
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:02,760
好! 他们已经到了 我会过来的
Good! They've arrived. I'll pop round.

651
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,330
我有事要告诉你
There's something I need to tell you.

652
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:06,650
好的 再见
'Right. Ta-ta.'

653
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:08,750
她会过来的
She's popping round.

654
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:13,760
怎么啦?
What's up?

655
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:17,730
有点失望 是吧?
It's just a disappointment, isn't it?

656
00:40:17,730 --> 00:40:20,310
持续的失望
An ongoing disappointment.

657
00:40:20,310 --> 00:40:23,880
郑重声明 他不是我的妹夫 因为首先
And for the record, he is not my brother-in-law because, A,

658
00:40:23,890 --> 00:40:28,770
你们还没结婚 其次 他和卡洛琳要离婚了
you're not married yet, and two - him and Caroline are getting divorced.

659
00:40:28,770 --> 00:40:33,040
事实上 证明完毕 不是我的妹夫
Ipso-facto, QED, NOT my brother-in-law.

660
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,930
我告诉过你什么都别说
I said not to say anything.

661
00:40:34,930 --> 00:40:36,500
明白 我知道了
Aye. Well, I did.

662
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:41,060
你们能不能只记住 我很后悔
Can we all just get it into our little heads that I regret it 

663
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:42,750
并且不会再发生?
and it won't happen again?

664
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:44,610
你要我把它写下来吗?
Would you like that written down?

665
00:40:44,610 --> 00:40:46,320
一式三份?
In triplicate?

666
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:50,470
用来干嘛? 那说明不了什么
What for? It wouldn't mean owt.

667
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:54,070
爸爸 我要生气了
Dad, I'm going to get upset.

668
00:40:54,070 --> 00:40:55,570
你想怎么样?
Well, what do you expect?

669
00:40:56,850 --> 00:40:59,470
她15岁的时候就搞大了肚子
She were pregnant when she were 15.

670
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:02,790
爸爸!
Dad!        

671
00:41:02,790 --> 00:41:06,770
伤透了艾琳的心 或许你不知道
Broke Eileen's heart. Perhaps you didn't know that.

672
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:13,240
嗨! 艾伦!
Hi! Alan!

673
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:16,030
你好 亲爱的      路上怎么样?
Hello, love.        How was your journey?

674
00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:24,350
很好      太好了! 一切还...?
It was fine.        Good! Is everything...?

675
00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:27,500
我去烧水      我给大家准备了晚饭
I'll put the kettle on in a minute.        I'm cooking for everyone.

676
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:29,740
如果没什么的话 半小时左右就好了
It'll be about half an hour if that's...

677
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:31,760
好极了 亲爱的      太好了
Perfect, love.        Smashing.

678
00:41:33,470 --> 00:41:37,680
我只是要来...告诉你点事
So, I just need to...tell you something.

679
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:41,120
凯特来了 你们得原谅我 
Kate's here. You're going to have to bear with me. 

680
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:44,500
我不是有意这么做的...只是
I didn't plan this exactly to coincide... Only, 

681
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:47,470
我周六晚回到这 朱蒂丝在
when I got back here on Saturday night, Judith was here.

682
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:03,750
哦 天呐!
Oh, Jesus!

683
00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:08,760
该死! 我以为... 他说你在...
Shit! I thought... He said you were in...        

684
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:11,130
那个哪儿来着...哈德斯菲尔德
Where is it? Huddersfield.

685
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:13,310
哈利法克斯
Halifax.

686
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:17,110
怎么了? 发生什么事了?
What's the matter? What's happened?

687
00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:19,690
你不会又摔下楼梯了吧 你这头蠢牛?
You've not fallen down the stairs again have you, you silly cow?

688
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:21,620
卡洛琳来了      什么?
Caroline's here.        What?        

689
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:23,850
卡洛琳来了!      什么?
Caroline's here!        What?

690
00:42:23,850 --> 00:42:26,020
卡洛琳...      卡洛琳在哈利法克斯
CAROLINE'S...        Caroline's in Halifax.

691
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:27,370
孩子们在哪儿?
Where are the boys?

692
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:31,830
在附近吧 你在这里干嘛? 你不是应该...
They're around. What are you doing here? You're supposed to be...

693
00:42:31,830 --> 00:42:34,520
他们把音乐开得很响 弄出很大噪音
They've been playing music really loud and making loads of noise,

694
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:35,920
东西丢得满厨房都是
and they were throwing stuff around in the kitchen 

695
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:38,220
然后上楼去了你的卧室!
and then they went upstairs in your bedroom!

696
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:40,200
那孩子要好好教育一下了
That kid needs to lighten up.        

697
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:41,700
我们以为你会出去整晚
We thought you were going to be away all night.

698
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:46,000
哦 天呐 别哭了! 才没那么...糟糕
Oh, God, don't snivel! It's hardly that...bad.

699
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:49,040
穿上外套 去我车上
Get your coats on, get into my car.

700
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:51,220
我明天早上回来 我不管你们怎么弄
I'll be back in the morning and I don't care how you do it,

701
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:52,100
但是那厨房
but that kitchen 

702
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:55,130
得跟我今晚离开时一样干净
better be as spotless as it was when I left here this afternoon.

703
00:42:56,020 --> 00:42:59,720
哦 你有朋友来 我也有朋友来
Oi, you have friends round, I have friends round.

704
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:02,330
你吓坏孩子们了
You've traumatised our children.

705
00:43:02,330 --> 00:43:05,680
我吗? 那你呢? 你对他们的伤害是永久性的!
I have? What about you? You've scarred them for life!

706
00:43:06,190 --> 00:43:09,220
你知道吗? 我真有点想吐了
Do you know what? I'm actually starting to feel a bit queasy.

707
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:13,140
这跟你对他们的影响比起来根本不算了什么
This is nothing compared to what you're actively inflicting on them,

708
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:14,500
你这个神经老拉拉!
you mad old dyke!

709
00:43:14,510 --> 00:43:16,050
带着你的废话
And bollocks to you with your 

710
00:43:16,050 --> 00:43:18,070
"跟我原来那个厨房一样干净"滚吧
"this kitchen better be spotless".

711
00:43:18,070 --> 00:43:20,500
我不知道为什么要浪费唇舌提醒你
I don't know why I'm bothering to remind you, 

712
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:21,410
但还是要说
but I will.

713
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:25,850
这房子...这房子全都是用我的钱买的
This house... This house was paid for almost entirely with money

714
00:43:25,850 --> 00:43:28,080
我这个最佳销售榜作者卖书挣的钱!
I earned when I was on the bestseller list! 

715
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:29,570
所以...
So f...

716
00:43:33,930 --> 00:43:36,000
明早见      好
I'll see you in the morning.        Yeah.

717
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:37,600
随便啦
Whatever.

718
00:43:38,270 --> 00:43:42,060
所以我带着孩子们去了凯特家过夜
So, I took the boys round to Kate's for the night

719
00:43:42,060 --> 00:43:47,730
嗯...老实说 隔天早上约翰自己也震惊到了
and, um...John was pretty appalled, to be fair to him, on Sunday morning.

720
00:43:47,730 --> 00:43:49,650
他已经尽力去打扫厨房了
He had tried to tidy the kitchen up,

721
00:43:49,650 --> 00:43:53,170
但他一整天连站都站不稳
but he wasn't really in any fit state to stand up for any length of time

722
00:43:53,170 --> 00:43:56,030
所以我不得不去帮他
until the early evening, so I had to help him.

723
00:43:56,570 --> 00:43:59,560
之后我问他是否要搬出去
Then I asked him if he would move out,

724
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:01,780
那样的话我们都可以继续自己的生活
so that we can all move on with our lives,

725
00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:03,380
但他还是不愿意
but he's still refusing to do that.

726
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:07,040
所以我让凯特搬进来希望
So I have asked Kate to move in in the hope that,

727
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:09,860
这样他能明白
at some point, he will get the message.

728
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:14,160
这就是凯特搬来的原因 行吗?
So that's why Kate's here, OK?

729
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:26,230
卡洛琳在哪?      隔壁
Where's Caroline?        Next door.

730
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:31,460
吉莉安会...留下来吃饭?
Is...Gillian staying for supper?

731
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:33,030
我不知道
I don't know.

732
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:38,280
你在烧...什么?
What are you...cooking?

733
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:40,650
是...嗯...我不知道
It's... Erm...I don't know. 

734
00:44:40,650 --> 00:44:42,290
卡洛琳负责的 我只是...
Caroline's in charge, I'm just...

735
00:44:42,290 --> 00:44:44,080
她在隔壁干嘛?      我...
What's she doing next door?        I...

736
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:49,070
天呐 我受不了了! 这是我家 我住在这
God, I can't stand this! This is my house, I live here.

737
00:44:50,060 --> 00:44:53,550
她是...? 她最好别      什么?
Is she...? She'd better not be.        What?

738
00:44:53,550 --> 00:44:56,220
跟别人说我的事
Telling people things about me.

739
00:44:57,470 --> 00:44:59,340
我不想在自己家里....
I'm not going to be made to feel like...

740
00:44:59,890 --> 00:45:02,410
都毫无尊严
whatever in my own house.

741
00:45:03,190 --> 00:45:06,630
我...没意见
I...have no opinion on that.

742
00:45:11,620 --> 00:45:13,540
就知道约翰是个混球
He's a mess is John.

743
00:45:14,050 --> 00:45:17,400
只要没人抱有幻想
As long as nobody's under any illusions.

744
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:22,110
卡洛琳 我要回家了
Caroline, I'm going to get off home.

745
00:45:22,940 --> 00:45:24,230
好
OK.

746
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:29,260
如果有需要打给我
Ring me if you want anything.

747
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:30,610
好
Right.

748
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:34,020
好 多谢 西莉亚
Right. Thanks, Celia.

749
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:36,440
好的 亲爱的
OK, love.

750
00:45:43,710 --> 00:45:45,000
我会...
I'll...

751
00:45:52,790 --> 00:45:56,510
吉莉安?      不好意思 我得回去了
Gillian?        Sorry, I need to get home.

752
00:45:58,010 --> 00:45:59,590
怎么了?      没什么
What's the matter?        Nothing.        

753
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:02,400
进去吧      不 不 我要...
Come inside.        No. No, I'll...

754
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:05,950
...发生什么事了?
... What's happened?

755
00:46:05,950 --> 00:46:08,100
没事 很好 我只是把他留在这
It's fine. It's fine. I'm just leaving him here,

756
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:11,140
离家有60 40英里的地方...
60, 40 miles from home and...

757
00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:14,020
她会照看好他的      我知道
She'll look after him.        I know that.

758
00:46:14,020 --> 00:46:16,350
我会盯着一切的
And I'll keep an eye on everything.        

759
00:46:16,350 --> 00:46:17,700
我知道 我知道你会的
I know. I know you will.

760
00:46:17,710 --> 00:46:20,860
你随时可以过来      我知道 我知道
You can come here any time you like.        I know. I know.

761
00:46:21,910 --> 00:46:23,530
你为什么要告诉你妈妈?
Why did you tell your mum?

762
00:46:25,890 --> 00:46:27,500
是因为那...?
Is that what's...?

763
00:46:28,450 --> 00:46:31,030
她告诉了我爸爸 他...      是吗?
She's told me dad and he's...        Did she?        

764
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:32,820
对不起 我只是...
I'm sorry, I just...

765
00:46:34,050 --> 00:46:39,580
我只是不能..只是不能...
I just couldn't... Just couldn't...

766
00:46:39,580 --> 00:46:43,840
别 别 总之都是我的错 不是吗?
No, don't. It's all my own stupid fault anyway, isn't it?

767
00:46:44,770 --> 00:46:46,330
他生气了?
Is he upset?

768
00:46:47,150 --> 00:46:49,750
哦 天呐 我很抱歉
Oh, God. I'm sorry.

769
00:46:49,750 --> 00:46:50,990
不 这...
No, it's...

770
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:56,410
他说了我妈妈的一些事
He said something about me mum.

771
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:58,570
仅此而已
That's all.

772
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:01,990
显然我伤了她的心
I broke her heart apparently.

773
00:47:03,370 --> 00:47:05,040
那时我15岁
When I was 15.

774
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:08,320
是的 我知道我伤了她的心
Well, I did. I know I did.

775
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:10,480
我那时怀孕了
I got pregnant.

776
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:14,390
不得不离开学校 我之后回去...
I had to leave school at the time. You know, I went back...

777
00:47:14,390 --> 00:47:16,740
参加高考 但是...
later to do my A-levels, but...

778
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:18,740
一直没考出来 所以...
it never worked out, so...

779
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:23,490
一切都令他们很失望
All very disappointing for them.

780
00:47:23,810 --> 00:47:26,350
所以 是的 是我的错
So, yup, that's me.

781
00:47:27,810 --> 00:47:28,900
你生了个孩子?
You had a baby?

782
00:47:28,910 --> 00:47:32,130
不! 没有 打掉了
No! No. A-Abortion.

783
00:47:33,530 --> 00:47:34,730
不好意思 我很抱歉
Sorry. I am sorry. 

784
00:47:34,740 --> 00:47:36,800
我不知道为什么要告诉她 我只是...
I don't know why I told her, I just...

785
00:47:37,330 --> 00:47:40,670
突然脑子一热 她是我妈妈...
had it on my brain and, you know, she's me mum, and...

786
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:43,630
会过去的      是的 会的?
Well, it'll blow over.        Yeah. Will it?

787
00:47:43,630 --> 00:47:45,650
只是这个糟糕的时刻 正值他...
Just bad timing. With his...        

788
00:47:45,650 --> 00:47:48,010
是啊 抱歉
Yeah. Sorry.

789
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:51,250
我走了      我会打电话给你的
I'll get off.        I'll ring you.

790
00:47:51,250 --> 00:47:52,680
我不是在指责你
I wasn't accusing you. 

791
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:53,920
我只是...      抱歉
I just...        I'm sorry.

792
00:47:54,330 --> 00:47:56,340
不是你的错 真不是
Not your fault. Really not.

793
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:05,810
我为什么要道歉?
Why am I apologising?

794
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:11,470
虚情假意的...
Sanctimonious b...

795
00:48:38,390 --> 00:48:41,280
吉莉安!      该死!
Gillian!        Shit!

796
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:43,080
我得跟你谈谈
I need to talk to you.

797
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:45,020
是啊 我不要跟你谈!
Yeah, well, I don't need to talk to you!

798
00:48:45,020 --> 00:48:46,790
事实上 这会儿...      我不能...
In fact, right now...        I can't.....        

799
00:48:46,790 --> 00:48:47,940
我最不想...
you're the last...

800
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:52,220
你不能对人这样的
You can't treat people like this.

801
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:55,180
你不能无视我的短信 挂我电话
You can't ignore my texts and hang up on me on the phone.

802
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:58,060
麻烦你能别呆我车上吗?
Can you get out of my Land Rover, please?        

803
00:48:58,070 --> 00:48:59,260
我们发生关系了
We had sex.

804
00:48:59,260 --> 00:49:02,520
是啊 所以我这是现世报吗?
Yes, we did. And, boy, am I paying for it now?!

805
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:03,990
你找上的我      没有!
You came onto me.        Not!        

806
00:49:03,990 --> 00:49:04,840
所以原谅我...
So forgive me... 

807
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:05,710
是的 你确实找的我      你...
Yes, you did.        You...

808
00:49:05,710 --> 00:49:08,310
我只是解释下对你的感觉
I tentatively explained that I had feelings for you.

809
00:49:08,310 --> 00:49:11,450
你说的 "我们上楼吧?" 所以原谅我认为
You said, "Shall we go upstairs?" So forgive me for thinking 

810
00:49:11,450 --> 00:49:13,420
我们要开始某种关系
that we'd embarked upon some sort of relationship.

811
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:14,380
行 对 对
OK. Right. Right.

812
00:49:14,390 --> 00:49:16,950
那么 麻烦你解释下周六晚上 
So, please, can you explain why, Saturday afternoon,

813
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:18,590
你为什么在电话里说
you're on the phone saying,

814
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:21,400
"我觉得我有点爱上你了 吉莉安"
"I think I might be a little bit in love with you, Gillian," 

815
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:27,110
之后的当天晚上 就在这里跟朱蒂丝同床共眠
and then, the same night, you're here, in bed with Judith apparently,

816
00:49:27,110 --> 00:49:28,860
正是那个你声称痛恨的人
who you claim to hate.

817
00:49:28,860 --> 00:49:30,050
她告诉你了 卡洛琳 她...
She told you. Caroline. She... 

818
00:49:30,060 --> 00:49:31,540
是的!      这么明显吗?
Yes!        Well, isn't it obvious?

819
00:49:32,310 --> 00:49:33,140
在我看来不是!
Not to me! 

820
00:49:33,140 --> 00:49:34,970
我在挣扎      什么?
I'm floundering.       What?        

821
00:49:34,970 --> 00:49:37,920
你不愿跟我说话 她决定做个女同
You won't speak to me, she's decided she's a dyke,

822
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:39,240
孩子们觉得我很可笑
the boys think I'm ridiculous.

823
00:49:39,270 --> 00:49:42,190
哦 不 他们没有 是吗?
Oh, no. They don't. Do they?

824
00:49:42,690 --> 00:49:45,770
我一无所有了 她让那个乏味的小女友搬进来
I've got nothing. She's moved her insipid little girlfriend in

825
00:49:45,770 --> 00:49:48,640
还有那个疯母亲...      喂 打住
and her mad mother...        Oi, steady on.

826
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:53,120
我买的房子 现在我是那个...哦 该死的!
I bought that house and now I'm the one who... Oh, shit!

827
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:56,200
我重新要杀回去
I'm going to have to knock to get back in.

828
00:49:57,590 --> 00:49:58,400
祝你好运
Bless.

829
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,430
是啊 这一切都这么好笑 是吧?
Yeah, it's all so funny, isn't it?

830
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:02,150
不好意思
Sorry.

831
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:06,010
我心里很乱 没法好好思考 之后...天呐!
I'm all over the place, I can't think straight, and then... God!

832
00:50:06,010 --> 00:50:08,780
结果我跟那个可笑的女人
I end up in another tawdry mess with that ridiculous woman 

833
00:50:08,780 --> 00:50:10,530
在孩子们面前出丑 要知道
in front of the children.You know, 

834
00:50:10,530 --> 00:50:14,170
人们情愿自杀也不愿意被荼毒大脑
people commit suicide with less than this eating away inside their brain.

835
00:50:14,170 --> 00:50:16,660
有..那么糟吗?
Is it...that bad?

836
00:50:16,660 --> 00:50:18,310
出版商和我解约了
My publisher's dropped me.

837
00:50:20,020 --> 00:50:21,190
为什么?
Why?

838
00:50:23,930 --> 00:50:26,920
已经酝酿有段时间了 我上周收到封电子邮件
It's being brewing for a while. I got an e-mail last week.

839
00:50:29,410 --> 00:50:34,900
嗯...你有没有可以谈谈的人?
Well...is there someone you can talk to about it?

840
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:37,780
没有 基本没有 我不想随便跟人聊这事
No, not really. It's not something you want to tell to just anyone.

841
00:50:37,780 --> 00:50:40,390
还有我的经纪人...不回我电话 所以...
And my agent...he's not returned my calls, so that's...

842
00:50:41,190 --> 00:50:43,140
要知道 在此之前 卡洛琳真的...
You see, before, Caroline would've been really...

843
00:50:43,490 --> 00:50:44,810
很擅长这类
good about something like that.

844
00:50:44,810 --> 00:50:46,740
她会联系前因后果
She'd have put it in a context.

845
00:50:46,740 --> 00:50:48,820
看出其中的端倪...
She'd have thrown a light on it that...

846
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:52,560
她真的是个很好的支持
She can be a really good person to have in your corner.

847
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:56,330
是啊 可惜你背叛了她
Yeah, well, shame you were unfaithful to her.

848
00:50:57,650 --> 00:50:58,710
不好意思
Sorry.

849
00:50:58,730 --> 00:51:00,970
一切都乱套了
Everything's just such a mess.

850
00:51:02,490 --> 00:51:03,690
你说的什么意思
What did you mean when you said, 

851
00:51:03,690 --> 00:51:06,270
什么现世报?
"And, boy, am I paying for it now"?

852
00:51:08,030 --> 00:51:10,500
嗯...好吧 他们都知道了
Well... OK. They all know.

853
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:13,740
我们...      是吗?
That we...        Do they?

854
00:51:16,290 --> 00:51:19,640
是吗? 有那么...
Do they? Well, is that...

855
00:51:21,310 --> 00:51:23,220
那么糟糕吗? 我们就不能...?
such a bad thing? Couldn't we...?

856
00:51:24,670 --> 00:51:28,810
不能 这是个本不该发生的错误
No. It was a mistake, it should never have happened.

857
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:32,720
我得走了 约翰
I have to go, John.

858
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:35,090
对于你出版商的事我很遗憾
I'm sorry about your publisher

859
00:51:35,090 --> 00:51:37,620
但你知道的 我们都有自己的烦恼
but, you know, we've all got crosses to bear.

860
00:51:37,620 --> 00:51:40,220
我不知道农场的开销我还能负担多久
I don't know how much longer I can afford to keep the farm going,

861
00:51:40,220 --> 00:51:42,200
维持多久      为什么?
way things are at the moment.        Why?

862
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:45,500
哦...钱呗      真的吗?
Oh...money.        Really?

863
00:51:45,850 --> 00:51:47,260
那是我的问题
That's my problem.

864
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:51,840
那么...如果我...偶尔过来坐坐
So...what if I...popped over some time? 

865
00:51:51,850 --> 00:51:53,080
会不会...
Would that be...

866
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:54,500
很...?
completely...?

867
00:51:55,410 --> 00:51:56,690
我在跟罗比约会
I'm seeing Robbie.

868
00:51:57,980 --> 00:51:59,130
我以为你憎恨罗比
I thought you hated Robbie.

869
00:51:59,130 --> 00:52:00,910
是啊 我也以为你憎恨朱蒂丝
Yeah, I thought you hated Judith.

870
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:29,560
你在外面干嘛?
What are you doing outside?        

871
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:31,930
我...有关系吗?
I... Does it matter?

872
00:52:38,110 --> 00:52:39,370
你要吃点什么吗?
Do you want something to eat?

873
00:52:40,750 --> 00:52:42,780
还有吗?      去找把椅子
Is there enough?        You'll have to find a chair.

874
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:00,850
你好
Hello.

875
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:04,530
你好 艾伦 怎么样了...? 你...?
Hi, Alan. How's...? Are you...?

876
00:53:04,530 --> 00:53:06,170
哦 很强健
Oh, fighting fit.

877
00:53:06,910 --> 00:53:09,410
很好 那很好 那...
Good. That's good. That's...

878
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:10,900
你要不要...?
Would you like...?

879
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:14,120
也许一小杯
Well, perhaps just a small one.

880
00:53:18,060 --> 00:53:19,300
我帮你拿个杯子
I'll get you a glass.

881
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:38,570
过来!
Come by!

882
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:41,760
走开! 走开!
Away! Away!

883
00:53:55,010 --> 00:53:56,640
麻烦你们能坐下吗
Can you sit down, please?

884
00:53:58,940 --> 00:54:01,020
继续走 快点
On you go. Come on.

885
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:17,330
进去
In you go.

886
00:54:41,350 --> 00:54:42,550
<font color="#4096d1">婚礼预约卡</font>

887
00:54:42,550 --> 00:54:44,470
<font color="#4096d1">阿兰・巴特萧和西莉亚・道森</font>

888
00:54:45,210 --> 00:54:46,510
哦 不好意思
Oh, sorry.

889
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:49,460
哦 我得接个电话
Oh, I've got to take this.

890
00:54:54,830 --> 00:54:57,420
你好 吉莉安      你忙吗?
Hello, Gillian.        'You busy?'

891
00:54:57,420 --> 00:54:58,670
我在开会
I'm in a meeting.

892
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:01,970
好吧 不好意思 但这事或许很急
All right. Well, I'm sorry, but this might be urgent.

893
00:55:02,660 --> 00:55:03,660
怎么啦?
Why?

894
00:55:03,980 --> 00:55:05,830
我爸爸和西莉亚在哪?
Where's me dad and Celia?

895
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:08,950
呃...据我所知是在家
Well, erm...at home as far as I know.

896
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:10,960
他们...那么 你...
They... So, you've...

897
00:55:12,390 --> 00:55:14,230
那么没人...
So no-one's been...

898
00:55:15,570 --> 00:55:21,250
我在沙发垫后面发现一张卡片
I've found a card, behind a cushion, on our settee. 

899
00:55:22,690 --> 00:55:24,890
是卡尔德达尔登记处的
It's from Calderdale Registry Office.

900
00:55:24,890 --> 00:55:26,270
预约卡片
'An appointment card. 

901
00:55:26,270 --> 00:55:30,440
他们已经预约今早11点...结婚
'They've got an appointment to get married at...11 o'clock this morning.' 

902
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,190
你开玩笑吧!
You're kidding!

903
00:55:32,670 --> 00:55:33,910
他们...?
Have they...?

904
00:55:33,910 --> 00:55:36,250
他们什么都没跟你说吗?
Have they not said anything to you?

905
00:55:36,730 --> 00:55:37,650
没有
'No.'

906
00:55:37,670 --> 00:55:39,380
呃...没有
Er...no.

907
00:55:39,380 --> 00:55:41,570
我打过他的电话 也打过她的
I've tried his mobile, I've tried hers.

908
00:55:42,730 --> 00:55:44,330
如果你能到的话 我也能
I can be there if you can.

909
00:55:44,340 --> 00:55:48,850
我或许能从62号公路上驱车赶过去 小混蛋!
I'll probably overtake them on the M62. The little buggers!

910
00:55:49,330 --> 00:55:53,000
但是...也许 他们不想我们在场
But...presumably, they don't want us there

911
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,960
也许 那才是关键
and, presumably, that's the point.

912
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:58,700
他什么都没跟你说吗?
'Has he not said anything to you at all?'

913
00:56:01,110 --> 00:56:03,740
自从他住到你们那儿去之后两星期
I've spoken to him twice on the phone...

914
00:56:05,140 --> 00:56:07,150
我跟他通过两次电话...
'in the last two weeks since he came to live at yours,

915
00:56:07,150 --> 00:56:08,920
他都敷敷衍衍的
'all of it very perfunctory.'

916
00:56:09,650 --> 00:56:13,100
最近我非常不受待见 是吧?
Not exactly flavour of the month at the moment, am I?

917
00:56:13,460 --> 00:56:14,900
什么 还是这样?
'What, still?'

918
00:56:16,060 --> 00:56:18,550
有点过分了 是吧?
'It's just a bit much, isn't it?'

919
00:56:19,310 --> 00:56:22,480
我们父母要结婚了 却不希望我们在场
Our parents are getting married and they don't even want us there.

920
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:24,480
也许他们不想兴师动众
Perhaps they don't want a fuss.

921
