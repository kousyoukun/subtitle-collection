1
00:00:01,655 --> 00:00:05,234
That is the most selfish,
mindless piece of driving

2
00:00:05,291 --> 00:00:06,230
I have ever witnessed.

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:08,159
Keep your hair on,
I'll be under 60 seconds.

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,759
Idiot. Snotty bitch.

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:13,319
Some braindead, lowlife, trailer
trash stole my parking space.

6
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,319
And you've met my daughter? Sorry?

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,599
Now then, we've got some
news for you.

8
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,320
We're getting married.

9
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,400
You're very pretty.
You're magnificent.

10
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,959
This marriage is over!
It is dead! It is redundant!

11
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,759
It never was!

12
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:36,159
We made love.

13
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,479
It was my birthday,
we were both a bit pissed.

14
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:43,199
'He's in hospital. He were rushed in
last night. He had a heart attack.'

15
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,279
Did I come to see you last night?

16
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,839
Alan? Or were I dreaming?

17
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:54,919
Yes, you did. You came to see me.

18
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,600
I love you.

19
00:00:59,529 --> 00:01:34,125

20
00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:49,225
He's come round,
he's regained consciousness.

21
00:01:49,225 --> 00:01:50,984
'Oh, Mum!'

22
00:01:50,985 --> 00:01:55,824
Gillian's just in with him just
now. She's just chatting to him.

23
00:01:55,825 --> 00:01:57,585
Alan's come round.

24
00:01:58,825 --> 00:02:00,864
'And are they...?'

25
00:02:00,865 --> 00:02:03,664
Is he, erm...? Are they
confident he's going to...?

26
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:08,704
Well, I mean, it's early days
but he seems very perky.

27
00:02:08,705 --> 00:02:10,624
'You mustn't tire him.'

28
00:02:10,625 --> 00:02:12,465
I'm not going to tire him!

29
00:02:17,025 --> 00:02:18,065
I love you.

30
00:02:19,345 --> 00:02:20,385
I love you.

31
00:02:22,545 --> 00:02:24,544
I think I love Celia as well.

32
00:02:24,545 --> 00:02:25,624
So do I.

33
00:02:25,625 --> 00:02:28,465
Hey, you can keep your hands off
her. She's mine.

34
00:02:39,865 --> 00:02:41,024
What are you going to do?

35
00:02:41,025 --> 00:02:43,184
Are you going to stay with us here,
or are you...?

36
00:02:43,185 --> 00:02:47,184
Oh, I think I'd like to be on hand
over the next few days,

37
00:02:47,185 --> 00:02:49,864
just till we know what's what.
I mean, if that's...

38
00:02:49,865 --> 00:02:51,424
It's wonderful, it's perfect.

39
00:02:51,425 --> 00:02:54,744
Do you want me to drive over to
Harrogate, fetch any of your things?

40
00:02:54,745 --> 00:02:58,744
No, no. You don't want to be
setting off, you need to be here.

41
00:02:58,745 --> 00:03:02,224
No, I'll get Lady Muck to bring over
a few bits and pieces.

42
00:03:02,225 --> 00:03:03,744
She won't mind.

43
00:03:03,745 --> 00:03:06,144
Celia... What?

44
00:03:06,145 --> 00:03:08,544
I just... Can I just...

45
00:03:08,545 --> 00:03:10,184
What, love?

46
00:03:10,185 --> 00:03:12,264
..hug you? Oh!

47
00:03:12,265 --> 00:03:13,664
Thank you.

48
00:03:13,665 --> 00:03:15,824
Thank you for making him so happy

49
00:03:15,825 --> 00:03:18,944
and thank you for bringing him back.

50
00:03:18,945 --> 00:03:22,504
Do you know? I think I did.

51
00:03:22,505 --> 00:03:24,864
No, I know you did.

52
00:03:24,865 --> 00:03:27,624
Now, you mustn't fall out
with him again.

53
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:29,704
Oh, well, it was him
that fell out with me.

54
00:03:29,705 --> 00:03:32,184
Yeah, well, whatever.
You know what I'm saying.

55
00:03:32,185 --> 00:03:35,904
I am never going to fall out with
him again.

56
00:03:35,905 --> 00:03:39,745
Ever! About anything.

57
00:04:01,745 --> 00:04:03,464
There you go, ladies.

58
00:04:03,465 --> 00:04:05,344
You're a gem, and a star.
Thanks, love.

59
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:08,224
I've penned that ewe up on her own
in t'barn and I've made a lasagne.

60
00:04:08,225 --> 00:04:11,704
There's enough for everybody, if Caroline
wants something when she gets here.

61
00:04:11,705 --> 00:04:13,904
Have you any idea how good
he's been?

62
00:04:13,905 --> 00:04:16,944
It's ME. Are you packing me
that suitcase?

63
00:04:16,945 --> 00:04:18,584
I have packed you that suitcase.

64
00:04:18,585 --> 00:04:22,464
Robbie says he'll have a bit of supper ready
for you when you get here, if you like.

65
00:04:22,465 --> 00:04:24,184
'Oh, that's lovely.'

66
00:04:24,185 --> 00:04:26,864
Thank you, tell him. 'And Gillian
says you're welcome to stop

67
00:04:26,865 --> 00:04:28,824
'the night, if you don't fancy
turning round

68
00:04:28,825 --> 00:04:32,864
'and driving straight back.'
OK. Great. Why not?

69
00:04:32,865 --> 00:04:34,584
So we'll see you in a bit.

70
00:04:34,585 --> 00:04:36,624
Yeah, bye. 'Drive carefully.'

71
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:39,584
Yeah, I will. Bye-bye.

72
00:04:39,585 --> 00:04:43,024
Why don't I pop over with her
bits and pieces? You?

73
00:04:43,025 --> 00:04:46,584
Well, it'll save you time and... The best
thing you can do, if you want to be useful,

74
00:04:46,585 --> 00:04:48,944
is stay here with the boys
cos I might stay over there.

75
00:04:48,945 --> 00:04:51,864
Why? Well, just tonight. Why not?

76
00:04:51,865 --> 00:04:55,144
They're old enough to...
why don't I come with you?

77
00:04:55,145 --> 00:04:57,264
Come... What for?

78
00:04:57,265 --> 00:05:02,144
Well, so I can apologise
to everyone for...

79
00:05:02,145 --> 00:05:05,024
Well, it was all my fault,
wasn't it? How?

80
00:05:05,025 --> 00:05:08,784
Well, if I hadn't told Celia about
you being...

81
00:05:08,785 --> 00:05:11,864
And then if she hadn't reacted
so badly to that,

82
00:05:11,865 --> 00:05:13,704
Alan wouldn't have seen how

83
00:05:13,705 --> 00:05:16,424
small-minded and bigoted
she... can be

84
00:05:16,425 --> 00:05:18,744
and then if they hadn't
fallen out about that,

85
00:05:18,745 --> 00:05:23,104
he might not have got upset
and had... had... had the...

86
00:05:23,105 --> 00:05:24,265
the heart attack.

87
00:05:26,025 --> 00:05:28,184
But it really is all about you,
isn't it?

88
00:05:28,185 --> 00:05:29,504
That's... That's just...

89
00:05:29,505 --> 00:05:32,304
When I get back, we really do need
to work out what's what

90
00:05:32,305 --> 00:05:35,864
and whose is what
and all the rest of it.

91
00:05:35,865 --> 00:05:38,704
Boys!

92
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:41,985
I'm off over to Halifax.

93
00:05:43,305 --> 00:05:44,945
Dad's going to be here.

94
00:05:46,305 --> 00:05:50,265
I'm on my mobile if you want me.
I'll see you later.

95
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:21,225
Mum, you've got a text.

96
00:06:51,545 --> 00:06:53,144
'Halifax?'

97
00:06:53,145 --> 00:06:56,184
Yeah! He's come round,
he's regained consciousness.

98
00:06:56,185 --> 00:06:57,424
'Oh!'

99
00:06:57,425 --> 00:07:00,944
Yeah, he's going to be fine.
Well, we hope.

100
00:07:00,945 --> 00:07:03,544
'That's...' I know.

101
00:07:03,545 --> 00:07:05,985
..fantastic.
'So I'll be back tomorrow.'

102
00:07:07,225 --> 00:07:12,384
Oh. So, we're not doing anything
tonight, then?

103
00:07:12,385 --> 00:07:14,585
Well, we left it up in the air,
didn't we?

104
00:07:16,545 --> 00:07:17,704
So, is that all right?

105
00:07:17,705 --> 00:07:21,785
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, course.

106
00:07:22,865 --> 00:07:25,824
We'll do something tomorrow.

107
00:07:25,825 --> 00:07:26,865
Good.

108
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:35,384
Can I just check your blood
pressure, Mr Buttershaw?

109
00:07:35,385 --> 00:07:38,384
Hm? Oh, yes.

110
00:07:38,385 --> 00:07:42,424
How are you feeling?
I'm very happy.

111
00:07:42,425 --> 00:07:44,664
I was watching you.
You and your wife.

112
00:07:44,665 --> 00:07:47,864
You're just so completely in love
with each other, aren't you?

113
00:07:47,865 --> 00:07:49,264
She's not my wife yet.

114
00:07:49,265 --> 00:07:52,185
But I do think
we need to get on with it.

115
00:07:53,505 --> 00:07:56,544
We are popping up back to the
hospital again, aren't we, Gillian?

116
00:07:56,545 --> 00:07:59,584
This evening? Absolutely.
I'd like to.

117
00:07:59,585 --> 00:08:01,024
Do you need me to come?

118
00:08:01,025 --> 00:08:02,344
Why? Have you got plans?

119
00:08:02,345 --> 00:08:03,384
Ellie.

120
00:08:03,385 --> 00:08:06,064
Who? Girlfriend.
She's not my girlfriend.

121
00:08:06,065 --> 00:08:09,424
She running rings round you again?

122
00:08:09,425 --> 00:08:11,344
She's not like that.
What is she like?

123
00:08:11,345 --> 00:08:13,384
She does blow hot and cold.

124
00:08:13,385 --> 00:08:17,184
Oh, you don't want that. Life's
too short. We're just mates.

125
00:08:17,185 --> 00:08:19,384
She uses you.
She doesn't use me.

126
00:08:19,385 --> 00:08:21,344
She damn well does! Once.

127
00:08:21,345 --> 00:08:22,984
What happened? Nothing.

128
00:08:22,985 --> 00:08:24,904
They had a date. "Date."

129
00:08:24,905 --> 00:08:27,584
Only she stood him up cos she got
a better offer.

130
00:08:27,585 --> 00:08:29,384
Yeah, nice! Bitch.

131
00:08:29,385 --> 00:08:31,864
That ain't what happened. Is.

132
00:08:31,865 --> 00:08:33,584
How would you describe it?
PHONE RINGS

133
00:08:33,585 --> 00:08:36,184
Well, I'd be minding
me own business.

134
00:08:36,185 --> 00:08:38,625
John? What's he want?

135
00:08:40,545 --> 00:08:42,744
Hello? 'Celia! Hi.'

136
00:08:42,745 --> 00:08:44,224
'What's up?'

137
00:08:44,225 --> 00:08:48,024
Just ringing to let you know that
Caroline's just set off, just now.

138
00:08:48,025 --> 00:08:49,384
Right.

139
00:08:49,385 --> 00:08:52,104
Probably be with you in an
hour, an hour and a half.

140
00:08:52,105 --> 00:08:54,464
Right. 'How is he?'

141
00:08:54,465 --> 00:08:56,064
Alan?

142
00:08:56,065 --> 00:08:59,104
'Well, it's early days,
but he's conscious anyway.

143
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:00,784
'Didn't she tell you?'

144
00:09:00,785 --> 00:09:02,664
Good. Yes! She did.

145
00:09:02,665 --> 00:09:07,184
Is...? Could I...? Is Gillian there?

146
00:09:07,185 --> 00:09:11,104
Gillian? Yes, she's here,
and Raff and Robbie.

147
00:09:11,105 --> 00:09:13,544
Could I...? Could I speak to her?
'Gillian?'

148
00:09:13,545 --> 00:09:15,664
Yes. 'What for?'

149
00:09:15,665 --> 00:09:17,984
'Well, just... just...'

150
00:09:17,985 --> 00:09:20,825
It's John.
He's asking to speak to you.

151
00:09:22,025 --> 00:09:23,865
What about?

152
00:09:25,905 --> 00:09:27,064
Hello?

153
00:09:27,065 --> 00:09:28,984
Gillian. 'Yes.'

154
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:30,064
It's John.

155
00:09:30,065 --> 00:09:32,064
Yes.

156
00:09:32,065 --> 00:09:34,584
Hi. Yes?

157
00:09:34,585 --> 00:09:38,424
'Look... Sorry.
I realise you're cross with me.'

158
00:09:38,425 --> 00:09:39,744
Am I?

159
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:41,464
Yeah. Aren't you?

160
00:09:41,465 --> 00:09:43,064
'For getting drunk and making a fuss

161
00:09:43,065 --> 00:09:45,624
'and spilling the beans
about Caroline to Celia and...'

162
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:46,744
Oh!

163
00:09:46,745 --> 00:09:48,304
..so forth.

164
00:09:48,305 --> 00:09:50,384
Well, it's all water
under t'bridge now, so...

165
00:09:50,385 --> 00:09:51,744
'Good. Good. Is it?'

166
00:09:51,745 --> 00:09:53,424
Gone and forgotten.

167
00:09:53,425 --> 00:09:55,544
Good. Good. Well, that's good.

168
00:09:55,545 --> 00:09:57,664
Bye, then.

169
00:09:57,665 --> 00:09:59,744
No. Wait.

170
00:09:59,745 --> 00:10:01,544
Then, there's the other thing.

171
00:10:01,545 --> 00:10:04,264
The other thing?

172
00:10:04,265 --> 00:10:08,264
'Could we...?
I'd like to see you again.'

173
00:10:08,265 --> 00:10:11,864
Right. Well, that's... That's not...

174
00:10:11,865 --> 00:10:15,784
The thing is. Oh, God.

175
00:10:15,785 --> 00:10:17,784
Hello?

176
00:10:17,785 --> 00:10:20,584
I think I'm a little
bit in love with you.

177
00:10:20,585 --> 00:10:24,824
Right. Right. OK.

178
00:10:24,825 --> 00:10:31,665
Well. That's... not exactly
my problem as such, is it?

179
00:10:32,745 --> 00:10:34,704
You can't talk. Obviously.

180
00:10:34,705 --> 00:10:36,864
And there is that.

181
00:10:36,865 --> 00:10:39,984
'Maybe... Could we... meet up?

182
00:10:39,985 --> 00:10:41,864
'Somewhere? Sometime?' No.

183
00:10:41,865 --> 00:10:44,264
I don't mind popping over.

184
00:10:44,265 --> 00:10:47,264
Did you get my text message?
Please don't say no.

185
00:10:47,265 --> 00:10:49,064
I don't think I could...

186
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:52,064
OK, so shall I give you back to
Celia?

187
00:10:52,065 --> 00:10:54,624
'No. No. I don't need to
speak to Celia again.'

188
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:56,464
No, OK. Ta-ta, then.

189
00:10:56,465 --> 00:10:58,864
Gillian. Gillian. This is...

190
00:10:58,865 --> 00:11:01,424
My dad's in hospital, John.

191
00:11:01,425 --> 00:11:04,944
We've got a lot on
just now at this end.

192
00:11:04,945 --> 00:11:06,384
Of course. Course you do.

193
00:11:06,385 --> 00:11:08,704
Sorry. Sure. It's just...

194
00:11:08,705 --> 00:11:10,424
'Boys all right?'

195
00:11:10,425 --> 00:11:11,984
Er... boys are fine.

196
00:11:11,985 --> 00:11:13,904
OK. Bye!

197
00:11:13,905 --> 00:11:16,025
Bye. Bye! Bye-bye.

198
00:11:26,785 --> 00:11:30,704
Dad! What's for tea? Nothing.

199
00:11:30,705 --> 00:11:32,465
I don't know.

200
00:11:46,265 --> 00:11:50,425
Hi, Judith. It's me.
Are you doing anything this evening?

201
00:11:51,425 --> 00:11:55,344
He said I can come home
on Monday, the doctor,

202
00:11:55,345 --> 00:11:56,984
all things being equal.

203
00:11:56,985 --> 00:12:01,064
That's... amazing.

204
00:12:01,065 --> 00:12:03,384
What else has he said?

205
00:12:03,385 --> 00:12:06,305
Oh... a few dos and don'ts. Like?

206
00:12:08,545 --> 00:12:12,144
Usual. No, come on.

207
00:12:12,145 --> 00:12:15,144
No enjoying yourself.
No singing, no dancing,

208
00:12:15,145 --> 00:12:17,464
no fighting, no farting.

209
00:12:17,465 --> 00:12:19,864
Different pills?

210
00:12:19,865 --> 00:12:21,585
No, no. The same.

211
00:12:22,865 --> 00:12:26,704
He told me there'd been...

212
00:12:26,705 --> 00:12:29,464
damage to the muscle.

213
00:12:29,465 --> 00:12:34,504
Yeah. Well, it's... sorted
itself out.

214
00:12:34,505 --> 00:12:37,464
I will be talking to the consultant
myself again, Dad,

215
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:40,624
in case you were thinking about
trying to pull the wool over

216
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:42,984
anyone's eyes with your
medical rhetoric.

217
00:12:42,985 --> 00:12:47,944
Why don't you take Caroline and see if you
can't find a cup of tea somewhere?

218
00:12:47,945 --> 00:12:51,585
Good plan.
We'll see you in a bit, then.

219
00:12:55,905 --> 00:12:58,344
It is nice to see you.

220
00:12:58,345 --> 00:13:00,785
Yeah, it's nice to see you as well,
love.

221
00:13:02,145 --> 00:13:03,545
They do cake.

222
00:13:10,145 --> 00:13:13,024
I've been thinking.
Yeah, so have I.

223
00:13:13,025 --> 00:13:16,144
Happen we should...
Just get on with it, the wedding.

224
00:13:16,145 --> 00:13:18,864
Great minds.
Bugger the practicalities...

225
00:13:18,865 --> 00:13:21,024
Like where we might live.
Let's just...

226
00:13:21,025 --> 00:13:23,064
Book a registrar
and get on with it

227
00:13:23,065 --> 00:13:25,504
and worry about everything else
afterwards.

228
00:13:25,505 --> 00:13:28,104
What do you think?
What about a venue?

229
00:13:28,105 --> 00:13:32,504
I don't know, I don't care.
Neither do I.

230
00:13:32,505 --> 00:13:36,464
We can get married in the car park
at The Dog & Duck for all I care.

231
00:13:36,465 --> 00:13:40,744
And... not tell anyone
till it's all over and done with.

232
00:13:40,745 --> 00:13:41,864
Anyone?

233
00:13:41,865 --> 00:13:44,624
Anyone.

234
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:48,024
Well, that'll get round the
best man issue very nicely.

235
00:13:48,025 --> 00:13:49,744
Won't we need witnesses?

236
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:52,064
There'll be folk passing.

237
00:13:52,065 --> 00:13:54,264
It's appealing to me.

238
00:13:54,265 --> 00:13:56,064
Yes, I can see.

239
00:13:56,065 --> 00:13:58,264
What did the consultant say?

240
00:13:58,265 --> 00:14:00,744
Just what I've said.

241
00:14:00,745 --> 00:14:03,064
Why is it that trying to get
information out of a man

242
00:14:03,065 --> 00:14:06,424
is like trying to get
blood out of a stone?

243
00:14:06,425 --> 00:14:08,104
I'm A1.

244
00:14:08,105 --> 00:14:10,704
Oh, you're not A1,
you've had a heart attack.

245
00:14:10,705 --> 00:14:11,945
I'm A1.

246
00:14:17,305 --> 00:14:19,904
I think I was more upset
when I heard about Alan

247
00:14:19,905 --> 00:14:22,184
than I was when my dad died.

248
00:14:22,185 --> 00:14:25,304
God, that's an awful thing to say.
Except he had dementia, my dad.

249
00:14:25,305 --> 00:14:27,944
So in some ways... Yeah.
..it was... Yeah. ..a relief.

250
00:14:27,945 --> 00:14:32,225
Do you think people can
die from a broken heart?

251
00:14:34,385 --> 00:14:37,425
I thought that was
what was happening.

252
00:14:40,185 --> 00:14:43,344
Course I couldn't say that to
t'consultant. He'd have laughed,

253
00:14:43,345 --> 00:14:47,104
or given you that look they do
where they feel sorry for you,

254
00:14:47,105 --> 00:14:48,464
for being thick.

255
00:14:48,465 --> 00:14:50,704
You've probably never had that.

256
00:14:50,705 --> 00:14:54,824
Well... How's Kate?

257
00:14:54,825 --> 00:14:56,825
Yeah, she's... She's...

258
00:14:58,385 --> 00:15:01,425
What? It's all...

259
00:15:03,465 --> 00:15:07,424
Like everybody suddenly knows and
I didn't want it to be like that.

260
00:15:07,425 --> 00:15:10,544
I mean, I don't think we know
what we are yet exactly.

261
00:15:10,545 --> 00:15:13,864
And everybody's gawping at you
like they're expecting you

262
00:15:13,865 --> 00:15:17,745
to make an announcement. Exactly
that. Sod 'em. Let 'em deal with it.

263
00:15:19,345 --> 00:15:22,425
Yeah. Yeah.

264
00:15:29,025 --> 00:15:31,705
I need to tell you this thing.

265
00:15:32,705 --> 00:15:34,225
OK.

266
00:15:36,065 --> 00:15:39,424
You'll probably think I'm a complete
dipstick when I've told you,

267
00:15:39,425 --> 00:15:42,704
but I'd rather be upfront about it
and then you know,

268
00:15:42,705 --> 00:15:47,344
and then we can either
move forward or not.

269
00:15:47,345 --> 00:15:51,864
OK. So, first of all...

270
00:15:51,865 --> 00:15:54,584
I don't regret it.
I don't regret anything,

271
00:15:54,585 --> 00:15:56,665
I make a point of not
regretting things.

272
00:15:58,905 --> 00:16:01,905
However... You've slept with John.

273
00:16:05,225 --> 00:16:07,944
I was pissed.

274
00:16:07,945 --> 00:16:10,144
It was my birthday.
I felt sorry for him,

275
00:16:10,145 --> 00:16:13,705
for being such a... twat,
he looked so pathetic.

276
00:16:16,265 --> 00:16:17,945
Oh, you really have slept with John?

277
00:16:27,825 --> 00:16:29,465
What was it like?

278
00:16:32,065 --> 00:16:33,825
To be honest...

279
00:16:35,545 --> 00:16:38,424
..I don't actually remember
very much about it,

280
00:16:38,425 --> 00:16:39,905
except that it happened.

281
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:42,985
Right.

282
00:16:45,785 --> 00:16:48,584
Are you... hating me?

283
00:16:48,585 --> 00:16:49,625
No.

284
00:16:52,225 --> 00:16:55,464
I didn't want you to find out later
from someone else and think there was

285
00:16:55,465 --> 00:16:56,784
any more to it than there was,

286
00:16:56,785 --> 00:16:58,864
because there wasn't,
there really wasn't.

287
00:16:58,865 --> 00:17:00,944
It was one of those things you do
and after you go,

288
00:17:00,945 --> 00:17:03,584
"God, why did I do that?!"

289
00:17:03,585 --> 00:17:05,185
And the truth is...

290
00:17:08,425 --> 00:17:09,465
..I was pissed.

291
00:17:11,105 --> 00:17:13,304
I don't even fancy him.

292
00:17:13,305 --> 00:17:15,705
I mean, you know, I don't mind him,
but...

293
00:17:18,185 --> 00:17:21,864
Oh, I'm daring to hope that this
isn't going down too badly

294
00:17:21,865 --> 00:17:24,864
judging by the expression
on your face.

295
00:17:24,865 --> 00:17:27,664
I'm pleased you told me.
It won't happen again.

296
00:17:27,665 --> 00:17:29,904
No, no... you can have him.
I don't want him.

297
00:17:29,905 --> 00:17:32,145
He's got a good income.
I don't care.

298
00:17:35,065 --> 00:17:38,664
Do you hate me? No.

299
00:17:38,665 --> 00:17:41,104
Are you laughing at me or with me?

300
00:17:41,105 --> 00:17:47,224
I don't know, I'm just... I'm...
I don't know, just laughing.

301
00:17:47,225 --> 00:17:52,264
You're thinking, "Braindead,
low-life, trailer trash," aren't you?

302
00:17:52,265 --> 00:17:54,104
Yeah.

303
00:17:54,105 --> 00:17:56,025
But that's cos I'm a snotty bitch.

304
00:18:00,665 --> 00:18:03,424
It's good that you're taking it
so well.

305
00:18:03,425 --> 00:18:08,144
Maybe you're in shock. Maybe the
implications haven't sunk in yet.

306
00:18:08,145 --> 00:18:09,984
Are there any?

307
00:18:09,985 --> 00:18:11,704
You're not pregnant, are you?

308
00:18:11,705 --> 00:18:15,665
No! That really would
thicken the plot.

309
00:18:21,785 --> 00:18:22,825
So, um...

310
00:18:24,185 --> 00:18:25,785
..when was this?

311
00:18:27,105 --> 00:18:30,544
Night me dad and your mum drove
back over to Harrogate.

312
00:18:30,545 --> 00:18:34,184
When he'd, you know, John had
spilled the beans to her about you.

313
00:18:34,185 --> 00:18:35,385
Our birthday.

314
00:18:36,745 --> 00:18:38,345
God. Right.

315
00:18:40,345 --> 00:18:44,144
When I was propping
Judith up in casualty.

316
00:18:44,145 --> 00:18:46,424
Were you?

317
00:18:46,425 --> 00:18:47,785
Blimey.

318
00:18:51,545 --> 00:18:54,025
"Are we cool, Vincent?"

319
00:18:57,105 --> 00:18:58,904
Is that from something?

320
00:18:58,905 --> 00:18:59,945
Pulp Fiction.

321
00:19:01,545 --> 00:19:05,385
I'm Samuel L Jackson
and you're John Travolta.

322
00:19:07,705 --> 00:19:08,745
Right.

323
00:19:10,665 --> 00:19:13,824
Then we go out and shoot
some students, I think.

324
00:19:13,825 --> 00:19:15,465
Unless I've misremembered.

325
00:19:18,665 --> 00:19:20,265
Blimey.

326
00:19:29,465 --> 00:19:31,784
I can't help thinking how
different things would've

327
00:19:31,785 --> 00:19:34,264
been now if he hadn't
pulled through. Oh, Celia!

328
00:19:34,265 --> 00:19:38,464
Well, you don't need to
think about that now, do you?

329
00:19:38,465 --> 00:19:40,384
I think the world of you two.

330
00:19:40,385 --> 00:19:42,425
You both know that, don't you?
Aww!

331
00:20:05,585 --> 00:20:07,864
I'll get t'kettle on.

332
00:20:07,865 --> 00:20:13,024
Where's little what's-his-name
with the broken leg?

333
00:20:13,025 --> 00:20:18,064
Paul? I got shot of him.
I took him to his granny's.

334
00:20:18,065 --> 00:20:19,905
Sit down, get warm.

335
00:20:24,345 --> 00:20:26,824
I might get back off home, Mum.

336
00:20:26,825 --> 00:20:28,864
Oh, I thought you were stopping.

337
00:20:28,865 --> 00:20:31,664
I've left John at home with the
boys, which I'm not thrilled about.

338
00:20:31,665 --> 00:20:34,784
I don't want him to think I need
him for anything, because I don't.

339
00:20:34,785 --> 00:20:37,264
He rang earlier, John.
I don't know why.

340
00:20:37,265 --> 00:20:41,384
Oh, to say you'd set off.
Seemed like an excuse.

341
00:20:41,385 --> 00:20:44,664
He asked to speak to Gillian.
I don't know why.

342
00:20:44,665 --> 00:20:46,464
I've been thinking.

343
00:20:46,465 --> 00:20:50,184
How would you feel if,
when he comes out of hospital,

344
00:20:50,185 --> 00:20:53,584
we came to live at my little flat?

345
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:56,064
I'd feel fine about it.
You see, the thing is,

346
00:20:56,065 --> 00:21:00,344
you know my dad died of a heart
attack, climbing the stairs.

347
00:21:00,345 --> 00:21:03,024
The doctor told him not to
and my mother, of course, said,

348
00:21:03,025 --> 00:21:06,904
"Oh, you'll be all right,"
and that was it.

349
00:21:06,905 --> 00:21:08,745
He'd not want to contradict her.

350
00:21:10,265 --> 00:21:12,184
He went as white as a sheet.

351
00:21:12,185 --> 00:21:17,624
Mum, it's your home.
It's absolutely fine by me.

352
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:19,544
What does Gillian think?

353
00:21:19,545 --> 00:21:23,824
See, I've no stairs,
and it's nothing but stairs here,

354
00:21:23,825 --> 00:21:25,864
and steep ones at that.

355
00:21:25,865 --> 00:21:27,065
OK.

356
00:21:27,985 --> 00:21:30,904
I've not broached him with it yet,
never mind Gillian.

357
00:21:30,905 --> 00:21:34,984
He might have other ideas. OK.

358
00:21:34,985 --> 00:21:36,305
Right.

359
00:21:37,425 --> 00:21:39,824
Is everybody warm enough?

360
00:21:39,825 --> 00:21:43,184
I'm going to... get, er... going.

361
00:21:43,185 --> 00:21:44,424
OK.

362
00:21:44,425 --> 00:21:49,024
I've a pile of paperwork to get
through and...

363
00:21:49,025 --> 00:21:50,944
Ring me if you want anything.

364
00:21:50,945 --> 00:21:54,185
I'll see you... I'll see you out...
Sure.

365
00:21:56,545 --> 00:21:58,985
See you. See ya.

366
00:22:04,425 --> 00:22:07,465
Are you all right? Yeah.

367
00:22:09,025 --> 00:22:13,665
Is there something up between you
and Gillian?

368
00:22:17,905 --> 00:22:20,865
She slept with John.

369
00:22:21,905 --> 00:22:26,544
She just told me. That night,
my birthday, her birthday,

370
00:22:26,545 --> 00:22:29,105
when he was over here
shooting his mouth off.

371
00:22:30,305 --> 00:22:34,304
You and Alan set off over to
Harrogate, I was propping

372
00:22:34,305 --> 00:22:39,184
Judith up in casualty and
they ended up in bed together.

373
00:22:39,185 --> 00:22:41,384
I mean, she's told me
cos she feels bad about it

374
00:22:41,385 --> 00:22:44,225
and she was drunk and she wishes it
hadn't happened, but...

375
00:22:46,825 --> 00:22:50,624
I don't know.
How do people do that?

376
00:22:50,625 --> 00:22:54,184
Why is everything so casual
and meaningless and...?

377
00:22:54,185 --> 00:22:56,344
I can't leave.
I need to be near him.

378
00:22:56,345 --> 00:22:59,104
No, I didn't...

379
00:22:59,105 --> 00:23:02,264
I know that, I don't expect you to.

380
00:23:02,265 --> 00:23:05,784
I was... Sorry, I just think I'm
a little bit shocked, that's all.

381
00:23:05,785 --> 00:23:07,985
Don't say anything. No.

382
00:23:10,545 --> 00:23:13,224
Do you think
before Judith, John was...?

383
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:15,545
At it with all and sundry?

384
00:23:16,545 --> 00:23:18,225
Like your dad?

385
00:23:19,905 --> 00:23:21,465
I don't know, love.

386
00:23:26,585 --> 00:23:27,985
Ring me. Yes.

387
00:23:29,945 --> 00:23:31,264
Don't say anything.

388
00:23:31,265 --> 00:23:33,585
No, don't worry.

389
00:24:03,185 --> 00:24:04,505
Everything all right? Hmm.

390
00:24:06,345 --> 00:24:10,344
I thought I might turn in early,
if it's all right? Sure.

391
00:24:10,345 --> 00:24:13,104
Course. You...
do what you need to do.

392
00:24:13,105 --> 00:24:14,145
That for me? Yeah.

393
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:18,664
Is it all right if I...?

394
00:24:18,665 --> 00:24:20,345
Course.

395
00:24:26,105 --> 00:24:27,504
Night-night, love.

396
00:24:27,505 --> 00:24:29,345
Night-night.

397
00:25:09,025 --> 00:25:10,704
Ready, Mr Buttershaw?

398
00:25:10,705 --> 00:25:14,104
I've been ready since six o'clock
this morning.

399
00:25:14,105 --> 00:25:18,384
Have you heck?!
Not sat there, in your coat.

400
00:25:18,385 --> 00:25:21,585
Still, wouldn't be the first time
you'd kept me waiting.

401
00:25:23,825 --> 00:25:29,144
You're never going to let that drop,
are you? I might do one day,

402
00:25:29,145 --> 00:25:30,985
if you play your cards right.

403
00:25:58,545 --> 00:26:02,384
I resolved, the first time it
happened, that I was going to live

404
00:26:02,385 --> 00:26:05,704
life differently and I did,
on the whole.

405
00:26:05,705 --> 00:26:10,505
I got in touch with you,
didn't I, for instance? But now...

406
00:26:11,905 --> 00:26:16,424
Now you're going to take things
steady. No. God, no.

407
00:26:16,425 --> 00:26:19,704
Now I'm going to really
start living.

408
00:26:19,705 --> 00:26:22,744
What do you think I'm doing
sat up here?

409
00:26:22,745 --> 00:26:26,745
Well, you know what the consultant
just said. Oh, bugger that.

410
00:26:28,145 --> 00:26:31,144
OK. So what've you got planned?

411
00:26:31,145 --> 00:26:35,424
Anything. All sorts. Such as?

412
00:26:35,425 --> 00:26:40,425
Have you ever fancied skiing?
No. Have you?

413
00:26:42,425 --> 00:26:44,864
Oh, you!

414
00:26:44,865 --> 00:26:47,264
Never! Good.

415
00:26:47,265 --> 00:26:49,784
Well, that's that dealt with, then.

416
00:26:49,785 --> 00:26:53,984
We used to come up here on bikes.

417
00:26:53,985 --> 00:26:57,064
Me and Maurice and Harry
and Joe Riley.

418
00:26:57,065 --> 00:27:00,824
You could get all t'way to Greetland
from top o' Barkisland

419
00:27:00,825 --> 00:27:02,504
without pedalling once.

420
00:27:02,505 --> 00:27:07,224
I know you could because... It were
like floating through the air.

421
00:27:07,225 --> 00:27:10,264
Because me and Eileen and
Doreen Wilkinson

422
00:27:10,265 --> 00:27:15,744
and our Muriel used to do just
the same. Did you? Yeah, yeah.

423
00:27:15,745 --> 00:27:19,064
I always used to think you were
a bit smitten with Joe Riley.

424
00:27:19,065 --> 00:27:20,744
Joe?!

425
00:27:20,745 --> 00:27:24,624
No. Although he was very
good-looking.

426
00:27:24,625 --> 00:27:28,624
I always thought he had
a look of Errol Flynn, but clever.

427
00:27:28,625 --> 00:27:31,064
He went to work for NASA, didn't he?
He did!

428
00:27:31,065 --> 00:27:34,744
He were made a Fellow of the
Royal Society, then off he went

429
00:27:34,745 --> 00:27:41,104
to Altadena, California.
Brain drain. He were my best man...

430
00:27:41,105 --> 00:27:45,584
when Eileen and I got wed.
Oh. Do you keep in touch?

431
00:27:45,585 --> 00:27:52,224
We did. Every Christmas, and the
occasional letter in-between.

432
00:27:52,225 --> 00:27:53,504
He popped over once or twice

433
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:57,064
to see his mother,
but we always caught up.

434
00:27:57,065 --> 00:28:01,465
I always fancied popping over there,
but it never happened.

435
00:28:03,305 --> 00:28:05,625
He had Parkinson's at finish.

436
00:28:09,145 --> 00:28:12,184
We came up here to
scatter my dad's ashes,

437
00:28:12,185 --> 00:28:14,784
me and me mum.

438
00:28:14,785 --> 00:28:19,744
We drove over from Sheffield and
we had Caroline in the pushchair.

439
00:28:19,745 --> 00:28:20,985
1969.

440
00:28:23,865 --> 00:28:27,024
He loved up here, me dad.

441
00:28:27,025 --> 00:28:28,944
It was a right farce.

442
00:28:28,945 --> 00:28:31,144
We thought it would be like powder,

443
00:28:31,145 --> 00:28:33,824
but it wasn't,
it was more like grit,

444
00:28:33,825 --> 00:28:37,784
granules, and it got everywhere.

445
00:28:37,785 --> 00:28:41,144
We just couldn't get rid of it. Him.

446
00:28:41,145 --> 00:28:45,464
We hadn't thought it through.
Well, she hadn't, me mother.

447
00:28:45,465 --> 00:28:51,064
And we hadn't got permission.
Well, we didn't know you needed it.

448
00:28:51,065 --> 00:28:53,385
Perhaps you didn't then.
I don't know.

449
00:28:56,025 --> 00:28:59,825
I don't know what my mum and dad
would've thought about me and you.

450
00:29:01,585 --> 00:29:04,944
Actually, I do.
They'd have been over the moon.

451
00:29:04,945 --> 00:29:07,185
They'd have been thrilled to
bits with you.

452
00:29:09,225 --> 00:29:11,745
Do you fancy a pint?

453
00:29:14,065 --> 00:29:16,344
It's only just gone half-past 11!

454
00:29:16,345 --> 00:29:18,624
You've only been out of hospital
half an hour!

455
00:29:18,625 --> 00:29:21,344
So what? You know damn well so what.

456
00:29:21,345 --> 00:29:27,584
Do you fancy popping over to the
Registry Office first, then?

457
00:29:27,585 --> 00:29:32,304
Are we serious,
about not telling anyone

458
00:29:32,305 --> 00:29:36,585
till it's all over and done with?
Well, I am, yeah.

459
00:30:15,825 --> 00:30:20,025
So that's a fortnight tomorrow
at 11am.

460
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:23,865
Shall I put that on a card for you?

461
00:30:54,745 --> 00:30:56,944
Well, it's a good job you texted me

462
00:30:56,945 --> 00:30:59,704
or I'd have been wondering
where you were.

463
00:30:59,705 --> 00:31:04,184
Is it wise to go gallivanting when
you've only just been discharged?

464
00:31:04,185 --> 00:31:08,784
I just wanted to see Ladstone Rock
and then we fancied a pint.

465
00:31:08,785 --> 00:31:13,664
Oh, so you went via Aberdeen?
That's right.

466
00:31:13,665 --> 00:31:16,784
Have you set a date? Sorry?
For the wedding?

467
00:31:16,785 --> 00:31:20,304
Oh, no, love. No.

468
00:31:20,305 --> 00:31:23,624
Alan needs to concentrate on
getting fit again first

469
00:31:23,625 --> 00:31:26,184
before we start
thinking of anything like that.

470
00:31:26,185 --> 00:31:27,904
Shall we get t'kettle on?

471
00:31:27,905 --> 00:31:31,865
And then me and Celia have got
something to run past you.

472
00:31:36,065 --> 00:31:39,344
Harrogate? I've no stairs.

473
00:31:39,345 --> 00:31:43,064
And you're out on the farm all day,
or down at the shop,

474
00:31:43,065 --> 00:31:45,544
whereas I can see to him 24/7.

475
00:31:45,545 --> 00:31:46,985
That's what I'm thinking.

476
00:31:48,625 --> 00:31:50,744
Well, that's very kind of you, but...

477
00:31:50,745 --> 00:31:52,904
And it's not like it's for ever.

478
00:31:52,905 --> 00:31:56,504
I mean, we do intend to buy.
Eventually.

479
00:31:56,505 --> 00:31:59,104
OK. And soon.

480
00:31:59,105 --> 00:32:02,584
And when we do, it'll more than
likely be round here.

481
00:32:02,585 --> 00:32:04,504
Well, we've not discussed that yet.

482
00:32:04,505 --> 00:32:05,864
No, no, but...

483
00:32:05,865 --> 00:32:10,424
And it's not a million miles away,
Harrogate, is it?

484
00:32:10,425 --> 00:32:11,704
No, it's not but...

485
00:32:11,705 --> 00:32:16,464
And you'd be more than welcome,
any time you fancied, to pop over.

486
00:32:16,465 --> 00:32:19,304
It is very nice, the house

487
00:32:19,305 --> 00:32:21,024
and Celia's little flat.

488
00:32:21,025 --> 00:32:23,865
I'm sure it is, Dad. I just...

489
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:29,624
So when were you thinking of...

490
00:32:29,625 --> 00:32:31,144
Tomorrow.

491
00:32:31,145 --> 00:32:35,704
Tomorrow? Does Caroline know...?

492
00:32:35,705 --> 00:32:37,904
She's fine about it.

493
00:32:37,905 --> 00:32:39,225
I see.

494
00:32:40,465 --> 00:32:43,504
So...

495
00:32:43,505 --> 00:32:46,625
Well, it just seems a bit sudden.

496
00:32:47,985 --> 00:32:49,384
But... Well,

497
00:32:49,385 --> 00:32:50,944
yeah, if it's what you want.

498
00:32:50,945 --> 00:32:53,824
I thought it'd be
a weight off your mind.

499
00:32:53,825 --> 00:32:55,424
You'll be 60 miles away.

500
00:32:55,425 --> 00:32:58,944
Oh, no.
It's actually more like 40.

501
00:32:58,945 --> 00:33:00,504
40, 60.

502
00:33:00,505 --> 00:33:03,064
He'll be in good hands.

503
00:33:03,065 --> 00:33:04,944
Yeah, I understand that, Celia.

504
00:33:04,945 --> 00:33:09,464
You'll have to pretend
I'm on holiday.

505
00:33:09,465 --> 00:33:11,744
Right.

506
00:33:11,745 --> 00:33:13,304
But...

507
00:33:13,305 --> 00:33:16,824
how about if I popped over with you?

508
00:33:16,825 --> 00:33:20,104
Just quickly, just tomorrow,
just to make sure you're... Yeah.

509
00:33:20,105 --> 00:33:22,344
..settled in all right
and everything's...

510
00:33:22,345 --> 00:33:24,784
Sure.

511
00:33:24,785 --> 00:33:29,105
Right. I'll get the kettle on.

512
00:33:34,665 --> 00:33:40,064
I've got my new hat.
So that's that bit covered.

513
00:33:40,065 --> 00:33:43,064
Something old, something new...

514
00:33:43,065 --> 00:33:45,264
Something old we've not got.

515
00:33:45,265 --> 00:33:47,264
Well, we're both old.

516
00:33:47,265 --> 00:33:51,025
Are we? Well, you are, I'm not.

517
00:33:53,025 --> 00:33:56,784
I started counting backwards
when I got to 36.

518
00:33:56,785 --> 00:34:00,184
So how old does that make
you now then?

519
00:34:00,185 --> 00:34:02,024
Minus three.

520
00:34:02,025 --> 00:34:03,624
Fancy.

521
00:34:03,625 --> 00:34:07,704
We had a very interesting
experience in 1988,

522
00:34:07,705 --> 00:34:11,784
when me and our Caroline
were both 22.

523
00:34:11,785 --> 00:34:14,744
That must have taken
some explaining.

524
00:34:14,745 --> 00:34:16,624
Not really.

525
00:34:16,625 --> 00:34:19,864
Something borrowed...

526
00:34:19,865 --> 00:34:26,424
I could borrow a bow tie off
Maurice. Then I'd be very dapper.

527
00:34:26,425 --> 00:34:29,104
You could and you would, but then
he'd want to know why you were

528
00:34:29,105 --> 00:34:31,344
borrowing it. You know what
a nosy old bugger he is.

529
00:34:31,345 --> 00:34:34,784
I could lie. I could say I'd been
invited to a cocktail party.

530
00:34:34,785 --> 00:34:36,824
In Manhattan.

531
00:34:36,825 --> 00:34:38,304
Mmm, he'd believe that.

532
00:34:38,305 --> 00:34:40,904
Only he might want to come with me.

533
00:34:40,905 --> 00:34:44,104
Tell him to sod off. OK.

534
00:34:44,105 --> 00:34:46,264
Something blue.

535
00:34:46,265 --> 00:34:49,184
A mucky magazine?

536
00:34:49,185 --> 00:34:51,664
Have you got any?

537
00:34:51,665 --> 00:34:53,944
No. Have you?

538
00:34:53,945 --> 00:34:56,265
Oh, yeah, got loads!

539
00:35:00,665 --> 00:35:02,505
No, I haven't.

540
00:35:54,105 --> 00:35:55,465
She slept with John.

541
00:35:56,905 --> 00:35:59,784
Who? Gillian.

542
00:35:59,785 --> 00:36:01,904
That night when we drove over here,

543
00:36:01,905 --> 00:36:05,104
and he'd been there shooting
his mouth off about Caroline

544
00:36:05,105 --> 00:36:06,544
batting for the other side...

545
00:36:06,545 --> 00:36:08,584
Slept with him?!

546
00:36:08,585 --> 00:36:10,745
Had... sex with him.

547
00:36:12,065 --> 00:36:13,304
How do you know?

548
00:36:13,305 --> 00:36:15,224
Caroline told me.

549
00:36:15,225 --> 00:36:16,664
Well, how does she know?

550
00:36:16,665 --> 00:36:19,184
Gillian. Told her, apparently.

551
00:36:19,185 --> 00:36:21,984
What for?

552
00:36:21,985 --> 00:36:26,865
Well, because... I don't know.
I think because she regretted it.

553
00:36:28,265 --> 00:36:33,225
I don't know why I've told you.
Well, except it's bothered me.

554
00:36:34,865 --> 00:36:37,664
Sorry. I don't want to
burden you with it.

555
00:36:37,665 --> 00:36:40,144
It's not... I'm not...

556
00:36:40,145 --> 00:36:44,184
I'm just a bit befuddled with it
myself really.

557
00:36:44,185 --> 00:36:49,264
And plus, I don't want to see her
get hurt. Gillian.

558
00:36:49,265 --> 00:36:54,225
God! He's a bugger is John.

559
00:36:59,105 --> 00:37:04,224
Gillian's coming! Gillian? Yes!

560
00:37:04,225 --> 00:37:06,624
And Kate's here.

561
00:37:06,625 --> 00:37:09,904
What's...? What's Gillian
coming here for?

562
00:37:09,905 --> 00:37:13,664
Would you like some tea?
Ooh. Hi, John.

563
00:37:13,665 --> 00:37:15,904
What's Gillian coming here for?

564
00:37:15,905 --> 00:37:20,464
Alan's moving into my mum's to
recuperate and I think she wants to
see him settled in.

565
00:37:20,465 --> 00:37:23,184
So, is... is she staying... long?

566
00:37:23,185 --> 00:37:25,944
I don't know.
You'll have to ask her yourself.

567
00:37:25,945 --> 00:37:28,344
Oh, and Kate's moving in.

568
00:37:28,345 --> 00:37:30,184
I'll get my things out of the car.

569
00:37:30,185 --> 00:37:33,944
Lawrence, can you help Kate
with her things?

570
00:37:33,945 --> 00:37:35,784
That's... You can't expect me...

571
00:37:35,785 --> 00:37:38,464
She's got her own house, what does
she want to move in here for?

572
00:37:38,465 --> 00:37:41,544
John, after I came back here
on Saturday night

573
00:37:41,545 --> 00:37:44,624
and found what I found, I'm amazed
you could begin to imagine that

574
00:37:44,625 --> 00:37:47,384
you have anything to say at all
about what other people do.

575
00:37:47,385 --> 00:37:49,544
Judith... Judith needs help.

576
00:37:49,545 --> 00:37:52,424
Judith and I are not an item.
Well, you could've fooled me!

577
00:37:52,425 --> 00:37:57,104
I will not be made to feel like a
sodding gooseberry in my own house.

578
00:37:57,105 --> 00:38:00,105
That-that-that was...
You have nothing to say.

579
00:38:05,225 --> 00:38:06,945
What time are they getting here?

580
00:38:22,105 --> 00:38:23,864
Blimey.

581
00:38:23,865 --> 00:38:27,665
My little apartment's
round the back, Gillian.

582
00:38:29,985 --> 00:38:32,225
Done all right for yourself here,
Dad, eh?

583
00:38:34,185 --> 00:38:35,664
What's up?

584
00:38:35,665 --> 00:38:39,824
I thought we were plumbing depths
with Susan Jatri's lad, but John?

585
00:38:39,825 --> 00:38:42,544
He's practically
your brother-in-law.

586
00:38:42,545 --> 00:38:45,344
And I thought you told me you and
Robbie were more or less an item?

587
00:38:45,345 --> 00:38:46,584
How did...? Who...?

588
00:38:46,585 --> 00:38:49,264
Celia told me. Caroline told her.

589
00:38:49,265 --> 00:38:52,784
You... I told Caroline
because I felt bad about it.

590
00:38:52,785 --> 00:38:57,544
I was pissed, it was my birthday.
Me and Robbie are...

591
00:38:57,545 --> 00:38:59,984
Are we going in? Yeah, let me.

592
00:38:59,985 --> 00:39:01,985
I'll lead the way.

593
00:39:03,585 --> 00:39:07,424
It didn't mean anything.
It was rubbish, it was ridiculous.

594
00:39:07,425 --> 00:39:09,505
I just felt sorry for him.

595
00:39:11,385 --> 00:39:13,624
You're a...

596
00:39:13,625 --> 00:39:16,025
What am I? Come on!
Don't hold back!

597
00:39:17,425 --> 00:39:19,144
..a pillock!

598
00:39:19,145 --> 00:39:23,384
Oh, OK. I thought you were going
to say something worse. I was.

599
00:39:23,385 --> 00:39:24,665
Yeah! Whatever.

600
00:39:26,385 --> 00:39:29,144
I've put my things in your bedroom.

601
00:39:29,145 --> 00:39:32,144
Is that...? Of course it is.

602
00:39:32,145 --> 00:39:33,545
How permanent is this?

603
00:39:35,465 --> 00:39:38,584
We need to sit down and have
the conversation properly,

604
00:39:38,585 --> 00:39:43,784
and not when we've been rushed
into it, but it's... Yeah. If...

605
00:39:43,785 --> 00:39:49,744
If... Yeah. If it's what you want.

606
00:39:49,745 --> 00:39:51,185
Do you need to ask?

607
00:39:55,865 --> 00:39:59,824
Hello?
'We're back, we've arrived.'

608
00:39:59,825 --> 00:40:03,264
Good! They've arrived.
I'll pop round.

609
00:40:03,265 --> 00:40:05,304
There's something
I need to tell you.

610
00:40:05,305 --> 00:40:06,704
'Right. Ta-ta.'

611
00:40:06,705 --> 00:40:09,265
She's popping round.

612
00:40:12,585 --> 00:40:13,985
What's up?

613
00:40:15,825 --> 00:40:18,464
It's just a disappointment,
isn't it?

614
00:40:18,465 --> 00:40:20,304
An ongoing disappointment.

615
00:40:20,305 --> 00:40:24,544
And for the record, he is not
my brother-in-law because, A,

616
00:40:24,545 --> 00:40:29,904
you're not married yet, and two - him
and Caroline are getting divorced.

617
00:40:29,905 --> 00:40:33,784
Ipso-facto, QED,
NOT my brother-in-law.

618
00:40:33,785 --> 00:40:35,864
I said not to say anything.

619
00:40:35,865 --> 00:40:37,424
Aye. Well, I did.

620
00:40:37,425 --> 00:40:41,864
Can we all just get it into our
little heads that I regret it

621
00:40:41,865 --> 00:40:45,344
and it won't happen again?
Would you like that written down?

622
00:40:45,345 --> 00:40:47,104
In triplicate?

623
00:40:47,105 --> 00:40:50,305
What for? It wouldn't mean owt.

624
00:40:52,705 --> 00:40:54,824
Dad, I'm going to get upset.

625
00:40:54,825 --> 00:40:56,944
Well, what do you expect?

626
00:40:56,945 --> 00:40:59,665
She were pregnant when she were 15.

627
00:41:02,385 --> 00:41:06,825
Dad! Broke Eileen's heart.
Perhaps you didn't know that.

628
00:41:08,905 --> 00:41:13,024
Hi! Alan!

629
00:41:13,025 --> 00:41:15,985
Hello, love.
How was your journey?

630
00:41:19,025 --> 00:41:24,625
It was fine.
Good! Is everything...?

631
00:41:25,665 --> 00:41:28,464
I'll put the kettle on in a minute.
I'm cooking for everyone.

632
00:41:28,465 --> 00:41:30,544
It'll be about half an hour
if that's...

633
00:41:30,545 --> 00:41:32,545
Perfect, love.
Smashing.

634
00:41:34,385 --> 00:41:39,184
So, I just need to... tell you
something.

635
00:41:39,185 --> 00:41:42,624
Kate's here. You're going to have to
bear with me. I didn't plan this

636
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:46,264
exactly to coincide...
Only, when I got back here

637
00:41:46,265 --> 00:41:47,905
on Saturday night, Judith was here.

638
00:41:56,785 --> 00:41:58,464
Ahh!

639
00:41:58,465 --> 00:42:00,464
Oh!

640
00:42:00,465 --> 00:42:04,144
Oh, Jesus!

641
00:42:04,145 --> 00:42:11,304
Shit! I thought... He said you were
in... Where is it? Huddersfield.

642
00:42:11,305 --> 00:42:14,904
Halifax.

643
00:42:14,905 --> 00:42:17,424
What's the matter? What's happened?

644
00:42:17,425 --> 00:42:20,944
You've not fallen down the stairs
again have you, you silly cow?

645
00:42:20,945 --> 00:42:24,784
Caroline's here. What?
Caroline's here! What?

646
00:42:24,785 --> 00:42:26,984
CAROLINE'S...
Caroline's in Halifax.

647
00:42:26,985 --> 00:42:28,864
Where are the boys?

648
00:42:28,865 --> 00:42:32,104
They're around. What are you doing
here? You're supposed to be...

649
00:42:32,105 --> 00:42:34,984
They've been playing music really
loud and making loads of noise,

650
00:42:34,985 --> 00:42:39,264
and they were throwing stuff around
in the kitchen and then they went
upstairs in your bedroom!

651
00:42:39,265 --> 00:42:43,864
That kid needs to lighten up. We thought
you were going to be away all night.

652
00:42:43,865 --> 00:42:46,904
Oh, God, don't snivel!
It's hardly that... bad.

653
00:42:46,905 --> 00:42:48,904
Get your coats on, get into my car.

654
00:42:48,905 --> 00:42:51,824
I'll be back in the morning
and I don't care how you do it,

655
00:42:51,825 --> 00:42:53,984
but that kitchen better
be as spotless as it was

656
00:42:53,985 --> 00:42:56,624
when I left here this afternoon.

657
00:42:56,625 --> 00:42:58,744
Oi, you have friends round,

658
00:42:58,745 --> 00:43:00,824
I have friends round.

659
00:43:00,825 --> 00:43:02,984
You've traumatised our children.

660
00:43:02,985 --> 00:43:06,424
I have? What about you?
You've scarred them for life!

661
00:43:06,425 --> 00:43:09,744
Do you know what? I'm actually
starting to feel a bit queasy.

662
00:43:09,745 --> 00:43:12,704
This is nothing compared to what
you're actively

663
00:43:12,705 --> 00:43:15,104
inflicting on them,
you mad old dyke!

664
00:43:15,105 --> 00:43:18,464
And bollocks to you with your
"this kitchen better be spotless".

665
00:43:18,465 --> 00:43:21,944
I don't know why I'm bothering to
remind you, but I will.

666
00:43:21,945 --> 00:43:26,544
This house... This house was paid
for almost entirely with money

667
00:43:26,545 --> 00:43:29,185
I earned when I was
on the bestseller list! So f...

668
00:43:33,905 --> 00:43:36,384
I'll see you in the morning. Yeah.

669
00:43:36,385 --> 00:43:38,544
Whatever.

670
00:43:38,545 --> 00:43:42,544
So, I took the boys round
to Kate's for the night

671
00:43:42,545 --> 00:43:46,664
and, um... John was pretty appalled,
to be fair to him,

672
00:43:46,665 --> 00:43:48,344
on Sunday morning.

673
00:43:48,345 --> 00:43:50,104
He had tried to tidy the kitchen up,

674
00:43:50,105 --> 00:43:52,864
but he wasn't really in any
fit state to stand up

675
00:43:52,865 --> 00:43:56,704
for any length of time until the early
evening, so I had to help him.

676
00:43:56,705 --> 00:44:00,384
Then I asked him
if he would move out,

677
00:44:00,385 --> 00:44:02,464
so that we can all move on
with our lives,

678
00:44:02,465 --> 00:44:04,824
but he's still refusing to do that.

679
00:44:04,825 --> 00:44:06,824
So I have asked Kate to move in

680
00:44:06,825 --> 00:44:10,464
in the hope that, at some point,
he will get the message.

681
00:44:10,465 --> 00:44:14,385
So that's why Kate's here, OK?

682
00:44:23,745 --> 00:44:26,425
Where's Caroline? Next door.

683
00:44:28,665 --> 00:44:32,064
Is... Gillian staying for supper?

684
00:44:32,065 --> 00:44:33,305
I don't know.

685
00:44:36,505 --> 00:44:38,064
What are you... cooking?

686
00:44:38,065 --> 00:44:42,544
It's... Erm... I don't know.
Caroline's in charge, I'm just...

687
00:44:42,545 --> 00:44:44,864
What's she doing next door? I...

688
00:44:44,865 --> 00:44:49,145
God, I can't stand this!
This is my house, I live here.

689
00:44:51,105 --> 00:44:54,344
Is she...? She'd better not be.
What?

690
00:44:54,345 --> 00:44:57,504
Telling people things about me.

691
00:44:57,505 --> 00:45:00,144
I'm not going to be made to
feel like...

692
00:45:00,145 --> 00:45:03,344
whatever in my own house.

693
00:45:03,345 --> 00:45:06,745
I...have no opinion on that.

694
00:45:11,985 --> 00:45:14,624
He's a mess is John.

695
00:45:14,625 --> 00:45:17,545
As long as nobody's under
any illusions.

696
00:45:19,585 --> 00:45:23,184
Caroline, I'm going to get off home.

697
00:45:23,185 --> 00:45:24,225
OK.

698
00:45:27,465 --> 00:45:29,984
Ring me if you want anything.

699
00:45:29,985 --> 00:45:31,624
Right.

700
00:45:31,625 --> 00:45:34,305
Right. Thanks, Celia.

701
00:45:35,505 --> 00:45:36,865
OK, love.

702
00:45:43,745 --> 00:45:45,665
I'll...

703
00:45:52,785 --> 00:45:56,745
Gillian?
Sorry, I need to get home.

704
00:45:58,425 --> 00:46:03,424
What's the matter? Nothing.
Come inside. No. No, I'll...

705
00:46:03,425 --> 00:46:05,824
Well... What's happened?

706
00:46:05,825 --> 00:46:08,584
It's fine. It's fine.
I'm just leaving him here,

707
00:46:08,585 --> 00:46:11,184
60, 40 miles from home and...

708
00:46:11,185 --> 00:46:14,264
She'll look after him.
I know that.

709
00:46:14,265 --> 00:46:18,064
And I'll keep an eye on everything.
I know. I know you will.

710
00:46:18,065 --> 00:46:21,984
You can come here any time you like.
I know. I know.

711
00:46:21,985 --> 00:46:23,745
Why did you tell your mum?

712
00:46:26,625 --> 00:46:28,464
Is that what's...?

713
00:46:28,465 --> 00:46:32,945
She's told me dad and he's...
Did she? I'm sorry, I just...

714
00:46:34,225 --> 00:46:40,064
I just couldn't... Just couldn't...

715
00:46:40,065 --> 00:46:44,424
No, don't. It's all my own stupid
fault anyway, isn't it?

716
00:46:44,425 --> 00:46:46,345
Is he upset?

717
00:46:47,625 --> 00:46:50,344
Oh, God. I'm sorry.

718
00:46:50,345 --> 00:46:51,385
No, it's...

719
00:46:54,345 --> 00:46:57,504
He said something about me mum.

720
00:46:57,505 --> 00:46:58,545
That's all.

721
00:47:00,465 --> 00:47:02,265
I broke her heart apparently.

722
00:47:03,545 --> 00:47:04,985
When I was 15.

723
00:47:06,545 --> 00:47:09,664
Well, I did. I know I did.

724
00:47:09,665 --> 00:47:10,864
I got pregnant.

725
00:47:10,865 --> 00:47:15,024
I had to leave school at the time.
You know, I went back...

726
00:47:15,025 --> 00:47:18,505
later to do my A-levels,
but... it never worked out, so...

727
00:47:20,825 --> 00:47:24,224
All very disappointing for them.

728
00:47:24,225 --> 00:47:26,945
So, yup, that's me.

729
00:47:27,905 --> 00:47:29,264
You had a baby?

730
00:47:29,265 --> 00:47:32,305
No! No. A-Abortion.

731
00:47:33,865 --> 00:47:37,704
Sorry. I am sorry. I don't know why
I told her, I just...

732
00:47:37,705 --> 00:47:41,624
had it on my brain and, you know,
she's me mum, and...

733
00:47:41,625 --> 00:47:44,224
Well, it'll blow over.
Yeah. Will it?

734
00:47:44,225 --> 00:47:47,745
Just bad timing. With his...
Yeah. Sorry.

735
00:47:49,665 --> 00:47:51,784
I'll get off. I'll ring you.

736
00:47:51,785 --> 00:47:54,504
I wasn't accusing you. I just...
I'm sorry.

737
00:47:54,505 --> 00:47:56,665
Not your fault. Really not.

738
00:48:03,865 --> 00:48:05,305
Why am I apologising?

739
00:48:09,665 --> 00:48:11,425
Sanctimonious b...

740
00:48:38,625 --> 00:48:42,144
Gillian! Shit!

741
00:48:42,145 --> 00:48:43,544
I need to talk to you.

742
00:48:43,545 --> 00:48:46,024
Yeah, well, I don't need to
talk to you!

743
00:48:46,025 --> 00:48:50,384
In fact, right now...
I can't... ..you're the last...

744
00:48:50,385 --> 00:48:52,744
You can't treat people like this.

745
00:48:52,745 --> 00:48:56,424
You can't ignore my texts and
hang up on me on the phone.

746
00:48:56,425 --> 00:48:59,904
Can you get out of my Land Rover,
please? We had sex.

747
00:48:59,905 --> 00:49:02,984
Yes, we did.
And, boy, am I paying for it now?!

748
00:49:02,985 --> 00:49:05,864
You came onto me. Not! So
forgive me... Yes, you did. You...

749
00:49:05,865 --> 00:49:09,064
I tentatively explained that
I had feelings for you.

750
00:49:09,065 --> 00:49:11,904
You said, "Shall we go upstairs?"
So forgive me for thinking that

751
00:49:11,905 --> 00:49:14,744
we'd embarked upon some sort of
relationship. OK. Right. Right.

752
00:49:14,745 --> 00:49:17,504
So, please, can you explain why,
Saturday afternoon,

753
00:49:17,505 --> 00:49:19,024
you're on the phone saying,

754
00:49:19,025 --> 00:49:22,744
"I think I might be a little bit in
love with you, Gillian," and then,

755
00:49:22,745 --> 00:49:26,904
the same night, you're here,
in bed with Judith apparently,

756
00:49:26,905 --> 00:49:29,144
who you claim to hate.

757
00:49:29,145 --> 00:49:32,424
She told you. Caroline. She...
Yes! Well, isn't it obvious?

758
00:49:32,425 --> 00:49:34,904
Not to me!
I'm floundering.

759
00:49:34,905 --> 00:49:38,344
What? You won't speak to me,
she's decided she's a dyke,

760
00:49:38,345 --> 00:49:39,744
the boys think I'm ridiculous.

761
00:49:39,745 --> 00:49:43,064
Oh, no. They don't. Do they?

762
00:49:43,065 --> 00:49:46,304
I've got nothing. She's moved her
insipid little girlfriend in

763
00:49:46,305 --> 00:49:48,904
and her mad mother...
Oi, steady on.

764
00:49:48,905 --> 00:49:54,504
I bought that house and now I'm
the one who... Oh, shit!

765
00:49:54,505 --> 00:49:56,384
I'm going to have to knock
to get back in.

766
00:49:56,385 --> 00:49:58,784
Aw-w! Bless.

767
00:49:58,785 --> 00:50:01,184
Yeah, it's all so funny, isn't it?

768
00:50:01,185 --> 00:50:02,704
Sorry.

769
00:50:02,705 --> 00:50:06,304
I'm all over the place, I can't
think straight, and then... God!

770
00:50:06,305 --> 00:50:10,624
I end up in another tawdry mess
with that ridiculous woman
in front of the children.

771
00:50:10,625 --> 00:50:14,424
You know, people commit suicide
with less than this eating away
inside their brain.

772
00:50:14,425 --> 00:50:16,944
Is it... that bad?

773
00:50:16,945 --> 00:50:18,585
My publisher's dropped me.

774
00:50:20,065 --> 00:50:21,585
Why?

775
00:50:23,905 --> 00:50:27,945
It's being brewing for a while.
I got an e-mail last week.

776
00:50:30,185 --> 00:50:35,144
Well... is there someone you can
talk to about it?

777
00:50:35,145 --> 00:50:38,064
No, not really. It's not something
you want to tell to just anyone.

778
00:50:38,065 --> 00:50:41,144
And my agent... he's not
returned my calls, so that's...

779
00:50:41,145 --> 00:50:43,704
You see, before,
Caroline would've been really...

780
00:50:43,705 --> 00:50:45,384
good about something like that.

781
00:50:45,385 --> 00:50:47,584
She'd have put it in a context.

782
00:50:47,585 --> 00:50:50,184
She'd have thrown a light
on it that...

783
00:50:50,185 --> 00:50:53,104
She can be a really good person
to have in your corner.

784
00:50:53,105 --> 00:50:56,425
Yeah, well, shame you were
unfaithful to her.

785
00:50:57,825 --> 00:50:58,984
Sorry.

786
00:50:58,985 --> 00:51:01,345
Everything's just such a mess.

787
00:51:02,785 --> 00:51:06,985
What did you mean when you said,
"And, boy, am I paying for it now"?

788
00:51:08,025 --> 00:51:11,144
Well... OK. They all know.

789
00:51:11,145 --> 00:51:14,145
That we... Do they?

790
00:51:16,065 --> 00:51:21,264
Do they? Well, is that...

791
00:51:21,265 --> 00:51:24,984
such a bad thing?
Couldn't we...?

792
00:51:24,985 --> 00:51:30,344
No. It was a mistake,
it should never have happened.

793
00:51:30,345 --> 00:51:32,944
I have to go, John.

794
00:51:32,945 --> 00:51:35,224
I'm sorry about your publisher

795
00:51:35,225 --> 00:51:38,544
but, you know, we've all
got crosses to bear.

796
00:51:38,545 --> 00:51:41,184
I don't know how much longer
I can afford to keep the farm going,

797
00:51:41,185 --> 00:51:43,664
way things are at the moment. Why?

798
00:51:43,665 --> 00:51:46,264
Oh... money. Really?

799
00:51:46,265 --> 00:51:47,385
That's my problem.

800
00:51:48,545 --> 00:51:51,664
So... what if I... popped over

801
00:51:51,665 --> 00:51:53,824
some time? Would that be...

802
00:51:53,825 --> 00:51:55,984
completely...?

803
00:51:55,985 --> 00:51:58,064
I'm seeing Robbie.

804
00:51:58,065 --> 00:51:59,704
I thought you hated Robbie.

805
00:51:59,705 --> 00:52:01,625
Yeah, I thought you hated Judith.

806
00:52:28,265 --> 00:52:32,385
What are you doing outside?
I... Does it matter?

807
00:52:38,625 --> 00:52:40,624
Do you want something to eat?

808
00:52:40,625 --> 00:52:43,745
Is there enough?
You'll have to find a chair.

809
00:53:00,465 --> 00:53:02,464
Hello.

810
00:53:02,465 --> 00:53:04,464
Hi, Alan. How's...? Are you...?

811
00:53:04,465 --> 00:53:07,424
Oh, fighting fit.

812
00:53:07,425 --> 00:53:10,344
Good. That's good. That's...

813
00:53:10,345 --> 00:53:12,704
Would you like...?

814
00:53:12,705 --> 00:53:14,505
Well, perhaps just a small one.

815
00:53:18,545 --> 00:53:19,705
I'll get you a glass.

816
00:53:37,545 --> 00:53:38,585
Come by!

817
00:53:40,185 --> 00:53:41,665
Away! Away!

818
00:53:55,385 --> 00:53:57,105
Can you sit down, please?

819
00:53:58,985 --> 00:54:01,545
On you go. Come on.

820
00:54:16,225 --> 00:54:17,265
In you go.

821
00:54:44,905 --> 00:54:46,825
Oh, sorry.

822
00:54:48,385 --> 00:54:49,625
Oh, I've got to take this.

823
00:54:55,065 --> 00:54:57,984
Hello, Gillian.
'You busy?'

824
00:54:57,985 --> 00:54:59,864
I'm in a meeting.

825
00:54:59,865 --> 00:55:02,544
All right. Well, I'm sorry,
but this might be urgent.

826
00:55:02,545 --> 00:55:04,384
Why?

827
00:55:04,385 --> 00:55:05,784
Where's me dad and Celia?

828
00:55:05,785 --> 00:55:09,264
Well, erm... at home
as far as I know.

829
00:55:09,265 --> 00:55:11,585
They... So, you've...

830
00:55:12,905 --> 00:55:15,384
So no-one's been...

831
00:55:15,385 --> 00:55:20,064
I've found a card,
behind a cushion,

832
00:55:20,065 --> 00:55:25,264
'on our settee. It's from
Calderdale Registry Office.

833
00:55:25,265 --> 00:55:27,744
'An appointment card.
They've got an appointment'

834
00:55:27,745 --> 00:55:31,304
to get married at...11 o'clock
this morning.

835
00:55:31,305 --> 00:55:32,584
You're kidding!

836
00:55:32,585 --> 00:55:34,664
Have they...?

837
00:55:34,665 --> 00:55:36,624
Have they not said anything to you?

838
00:55:36,625 --> 00:55:38,064
'No.'

839
00:55:38,065 --> 00:55:39,624
Er... no.

840
00:55:39,625 --> 00:55:43,424
I've tried his mobile,
I've tried hers.

841
00:55:43,425 --> 00:55:45,224
I can be there if you can.

842
00:55:45,225 --> 00:55:49,384
I'll probably overtake them
on the M62. The little buggers!

843
00:55:49,385 --> 00:55:53,544
But... presumably, they don't
want us there

844
00:55:53,545 --> 00:55:57,024
and, presumably, that's the point.

845
00:55:57,025 --> 00:55:59,305
'Has he not said
anything to you at all?'

846
00:56:01,705 --> 00:56:04,024
I've spoken to him twice
on the phone...

847
00:56:04,025 --> 00:56:07,704
'in the last two weeks
since he came to live at yours,

848
00:56:07,705 --> 00:56:09,304
'all of it very perfunctory.'

849
00:56:09,305 --> 00:56:13,624
Not exactly flavour of the month
at the moment, am I?

850
00:56:13,625 --> 00:56:15,025
'What, still?'

851
00:56:16,385 --> 00:56:19,344
'It's just a bit much, isn't it?'

852
00:56:19,345 --> 00:56:22,784
Our parents are getting married and
they don't even want us there.

853
00:56:22,785 --> 00:56:25,225
Perhaps they don't want a fuss.

854
00:56:27,305 --> 00:56:30,024
Gillian, I'm going to have to go.
I'm chairing a meeting.

855
00:56:30,025 --> 00:56:32,424
Right. Sorry, is that all right?
Can I ring you...?

856
00:56:32,425 --> 00:56:33,825
Bi...

857
00:57:09,905 --> 00:57:11,704
Shall we get married
and not tell anyone?

858
00:57:11,705 --> 00:57:14,944
'You doing anything this weekend?'
What did you have in mind? All sorts.

859
00:57:14,945 --> 00:57:18,864
I want a baby.

860
00:57:18,865 --> 00:57:20,624
No.

861
00:57:20,625 --> 00:57:23,304
No, Caroline, I'm serious.

862
00:57:23,305 --> 00:57:25,504
Just keep pushing, love!
keep pushing.

863
00:57:25,505 --> 00:57:28,624
Keep squeezing Grandad's hand.
He's not me grandad!

864
00:57:28,625 --> 00:57:32,064
We'd have never carried on like that
at that age, would we?

865
00:57:32,065 --> 00:57:34,864
Don't go, Dad.

866
00:57:34,865 --> 00:57:38,544
I don't know how you could fashion
talking to your dad like this,

867
00:57:38,545 --> 00:57:41,224
when you know how poorly he's been.

868
00:57:41,225 --> 00:57:42,705
Pow.

869
00:57:43,531 --> 00:58:14,280
