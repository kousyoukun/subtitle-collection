1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:05,030
That is the most selfish,
mindless piece of driving

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,070
I have ever witnessed.

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,910
Keep your hair on,
I'll be under 60 seconds.

4
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,510
Idiot. Snotty bitch.

5
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:13,070
Some braindead, lowlife, trailer
trash stole my parking space.

6
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:16,070
And you've met my daughter? Sorry?

7
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:18,350
Now then, we've got some
news for you.

8
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,080
BOTH: We're getting married.

9
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:24,160
You're very pretty.
You're magnificent.

10
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,710
This marriage is over!
It is dead! It is redundant!

11
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,510
It never was!

12
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:35,910
We made love.

13
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,230
It was my birthday,
we were both a bit pissed.

14
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:42,950
'He's in hospital. He were rushed in
last night. He had a heart attack.'

15
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,030
Did I come to see you last night?

16
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:48,590
Alan? Or were I dreaming?

17
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:54,670
Yes, you did. You came to see me.

18
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,360
I love you.

19
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,150
He's come round,
he's regained consciousness.

20
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,910
'Oh, Mum!'

21
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:55,750
Gillian's just in with him just
now. She's just chatting to him.

22
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,520
Alan's come round.

23
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,790
'And are they...?'

24
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,590
Is he, erm...? Are they
confident he's going to...?

25
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,630
Well, I mean, it's early days
but he seems very perky.

26
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,550
'You mustn't tire him.'

27
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,400
I'm not going to tire him!

28
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,000
I love you.

29
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,320
I love you.

30
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,470
I think I love Celia as well.

31
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,550
So do I.

32
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,400
Hey, you can keep your hands off
her. She's mine.

33
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,950
What are you going to do?

34
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,110
Are you going to stay with us here,
or are you...?

35
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,110
Oh, I think I'd like to be on hand
over the next few days,

36
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,790
just till we know what's what.
I mean, if that's...

37
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,350
It's wonderful, it's perfect.

38
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,670
Do you want me to drive over to
Harrogate, fetch any of your things?

39
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:58,670
No, no. You don't want to be
setting off, you need to be here.

40
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:02,150
No, I'll get Lady Muck to bring over
a few bits and pieces.

41
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,670
She won't mind.

42
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,070
Celia... What?

43
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,470
I just... Can I just...

44
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,110
What, love?

45
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,190
..hug you? Oh!

46
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,590
Thank you.

47
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,750
Thank you for making him so happy

48
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,870
and thank you for bringing him back.

49
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:22,430
Do you know? I think I did.

50
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,790
No, I know you did.

51
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,550
Now, you mustn't fall out
with him again.

52
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,630
Oh, well, it was him
that fell out with me.

53
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:32,110
Yeah, well, whatever.
You know what I'm saying.

54
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,830
I am never going to fall out with
him again.

55
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,680
Ever! About anything.

56
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,390
There you go, ladies.

57
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,270
You're a gem, and a star.
Thanks, love.

58
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,150
I've penned that ewe up on her own
in t'barn and I've made a lasagne.

59
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:11,630
There's enough for everybody,
if Caroline wants something when she
gets here.

60
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,830
Have you any idea how good
he's been?

61
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,870
It's ME. Are you packing me
that suitcase?

62
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,510
I have packed you that suitcase.

63
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:22,390
Robbie says he'll have a bit of
supper ready for you when you get
here, if you like.

64
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,110
'Oh, that's lovely.'

65
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,790
Thank you, tell him. 'And Gillian
says you're welcome to stop

66
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,750
'the night, if you don't fancy
turning round

67
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:32,790
'and driving straight back.'
OK. Great. Why not?

68
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,510
So we'll see you in a bit.

69
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,550
Yeah, bye. 'Drive carefully.'

70
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,510
Yeah, I will. Bye-bye.

71
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,950
Why don't I pop over with her
bits and pieces? You?

72
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,510
Well, it'll save you time and...
The best thing you can do,
if you want to be useful,

73
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,870
is stay here with the boys
cos I might stay over there.

74
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,790
Why? Well, just tonight. Why not?

75
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:55,070
They're old enough to...
why don't I come with you?

76
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,190
Come... What for?

77
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:02,070
Well, so I can apologise
to everyone for...

78
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,950
Well, it was all my fault,
wasn't it? How?

79
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,710
Well, if I hadn't told Celia about
you being...

80
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,790
And then if she hadn't reacted
so badly to that,

81
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,630
Alan wouldn't have seen how

82
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:16,350
small-minded and bigoted
she...can be

83
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,670
and then if they hadn't
fallen out about that,

84
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:23,030
he might not have got upset
and had...had...had the...

85
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,200
the heart attack.

86
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,110
But it really is all about you,
isn't it?

87
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,430
That's... That's just...

88
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,230
When I get back, we really do need
to work out what's what

89
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,790
and whose is what
and all the rest of it.

90
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,630
Boys!

91
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,920
I'm off over to Halifax.

92
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,880
Dad's going to be here.

93
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,200
I'm on my mobile if you want me.
I'll see you later.

94
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:21,160
PHONE BEEPS
Mum, you've got a text.

95
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,080
PHONE BEEPS

96
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,070
'Halifax?'

97
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:56,110
Yeah! He's come round,
he's regained consciousness.

98
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,350
'Oh!'

99
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,870
Yeah, he's going to be fine.
Well, we hope.

100
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,470
'That's...' I know.

101
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,920
..fantastic.
'So I'll be back tomorrow.'

102
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:12,310
Oh. So, we're not doing anything
tonight, then?

103
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,520
Well, we left it up in the air,
didn't we?

104
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,630
So, is that all right?

105
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:21,720
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, course.

106
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,750
We'll do something tomorrow.

107
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:26,800
Good.

108
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:35,310
Can I just check your blood
pressure, Mr Buttershaw?

109
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:38,310
Hm? Oh, yes.

110
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:42,350
How are you feeling?
I'm very happy.

111
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,590
I was watching you.
You and your wife.

112
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,790
You're just so completely in love
with each other, aren't you?

113
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,190
She's not my wife yet.

114
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:52,120
But I do think
we need to get on with it.

115
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,470
We are popping up back to the
hospital again, aren't we, Gillian?

116
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:59,510
This evening? Absolutely.
I'd like to.

117
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,950
Do you need me to come?

118
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,270
Why? Have you got plans?

119
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,310
Ellie.

120
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,990
Who? Girlfriend.
She's not my girlfriend.

She running rings round you again?

122
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,270
She's not like that.
What is she like?

123
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,310
She does blow hot and cold.

124
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:17,110
Oh, you don't want that. Life's
too short. We're just mates.

125
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,310
She uses you.
She doesn't use me.

126
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,270
She damn well does! Once.

127
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,910
What happened? Nothing.

128
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,830
They had a date. "Date."

129
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,510
Only she stood him up cos she got
a better offer.

130
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,310
Yeah, nice(!) Bitch.

131
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,790
That ain't what happened. Is.

132
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,510
How would you describe it?

'What's up?'

00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:47,950
Just ringing to let you know that
Caroline's just set off, just now.

00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,310
Right.

139
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,030
Probably be with you in an
hour, an hour and a half.

Right. 'How is he?'

but he's conscious anyway.

'Didn't she tell you?'

Good. Yes! She did.

Gillian? Yes, she's here,

Could I...? Could I speak to her?

I realise you're cross with me.'

00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,390
Yeah. Aren't you?

160
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,990
'For getting drunk and making a fuss

161
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,550
'and spilling the beans
about Caroline to Celia and...'

162
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,670
Oh!

163
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,230
..so forth.

164
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,310
Well, it's all water
under t'bridge now, so...

165
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,670
'Good. Good. Is it?'

166
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,350
Gone and forgotten.

167
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,470
Good. Good. Well, that's good.

168
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,590
Bye, then.

169
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,670
No. Wait.

170
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,470
Then, there's the other thing.

171
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:04,190
The other thing?

172
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:08,190
'Could we...?
I'd like to see you again.'

173
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:11,790
Right. Well, that's... That's not...

174
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:15,710
The thing is. Oh, God.

175
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,710
Hello?

176
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,510
I think I'm a little
bit in love with you.

177
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:24,750
Right. Right. OK.

178
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:31,600
Well. That's...not exactly
my problem as such, is it?

179
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,630
You can't talk. Obviously.

180
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,790
And there is that.

181
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,910
'Maybe... Could we...meet up?

182
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,790
'Somewhere? Sometime?' No.

183
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,190
I don't mind popping over.

184
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:47,190
Did you get my text message?
Please don't say no.

185
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,990
I don't think I could...

186
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,990
OK, so shall I give you back to
Celia?

187
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,550
'No. No. I don't need to
speak to Celia again.'

188
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,390
No, OK. Ta-ta, then.

189
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,790
Gillian. Gillian. This is...

190
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,350
My dad's in hospital, John.

191
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,870
We've got a lot on
just now at this end.

192
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,310
Of course. Course you do.

193
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,630
Sorry. Sure. It's just...

194
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,350
'Boys all right?'

195
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,910
Er...boys are fine.

196
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,830
OK. Bye!

197
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,960
Bye. Bye! Bye-bye.

198
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,630
Dad! What's for tea? Nothing.

199
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,400
I don't know.

200
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:50,360
Hi, Judith. It's me.
Are you doing anything this evening?

201
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,270
He said I can come home
on Monday, the doctor,

202
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,910
all things being equal.

203
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:00,990
That's...amazing.

204
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,310
What else has he said?

205
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:06,240
Oh...a few dos and don'ts. Like?

206
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,070
Usual. No, come on.

207
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:15,070
No enjoying yourself.
No singing, no dancing,

208
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,390
no fighting, no farting.

209
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,790
THEY LAUGH
Different pills?

210
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,520
No, no. The same.

211
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,630
He told me there'd been...

212
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:29,390
damage to the muscle.

213
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:34,430
Yeah. Well, it's...sorted
itself out.

214
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:37,390
I will be talking to the consultant
myself again, Dad,

215
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:40,550
in case you were thinking about
trying to pull the wool over

216
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,910
anyone's eyes with your
medical rhetoric.

217
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:47,870
Why don't you take Caroline
and see if you can't find
a cup of tea somewhere?

218
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:51,520
Good plan.
We'll see you in a bit, then.

219
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,270
It is nice to see you.

220
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,720
Yeah, it's nice to see you as well,
love.

221
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,480
They do cake.

222
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,950
I've been thinking.
Yeah, so have I.

223
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:16,070
Happen we should...
Just get on with it, the wedding.

224
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,790
Great minds.
Bugger the practicalities...

225
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,950
Like where we might live.
Let's just...

226
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,990
Book a registrar
and get on with it

227
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,430
and worry about everything else
afterwards.

228
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,030
What do you think?
What about a venue?

229
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:32,430
I don't know, I don't care.
Neither do I.

230
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:36,390
We can get married in the car park
at The Dog & Duck for all I care.

231
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:40,670
And...not tell anyone
till it's all over and done with.

232
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:41,790
Anyone?

233
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,550
Anyone.

234
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,950
Well, that'll get round the
best man issue very nicely.

235
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,670
Won't we need witnesses?

236
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,990
There'll be folk passing.

237
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,190
It's appealing to me.

238
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,990
Yes, I can see.

239
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,190
What did the consultant say?

240
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,670
Just what I've said.

241
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,990
Why is it that trying to get
information out of a man

242
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,350
is like trying to get
blood out of a stone?

243
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,030
I'm A1.

244
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,630
Oh, you're not A1,
you've had a heart attack.

245
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:11,880
(I'm A1.)

246
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,830
I think I was more upset
when I heard about Alan

247
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:22,110
than I was when my dad died.

248
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:25,230
God, that's an awful thing to say.
Except he had dementia, my dad.

249
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,870
So in some ways... Yeah.
..it was... Yeah...a relief.

250
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:32,160
Do you think people can
die from a broken heart?

251
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,360
I thought that was
what was happening.

252
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:43,270
Course I couldn't say that to
t'consultant. He'd have laughed,

253
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:47,030
or given you that look they do
where they feel sorry for you,

254
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,390
for being thick.

255
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,630
You've probably never had that.

256
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:54,750
Well... How's Kate?

257
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,760
Yeah, she's... She's...

258
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,360
What? It's all...

259
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:07,350
Like everybody suddenly knows and
I didn't want it to be like that.

260
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,470
I mean, I don't think we know
what we are yet exactly.

261
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,790
And everybody's gawping at you
like they're expecting you

262
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:17,680
to make an announcement. Exactly
that. Sod 'em. Let 'em deal with it.

263
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:22,360
Yeah. Yeah.

264
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:31,640
I need to tell you this thing.

265
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,160
OK.

266
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,350
You'll probably think I'm a complete
dipstick when I've told you,

267
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,630
but I'd rather be upfront about it
and then you know,

268
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:47,270
and then we can either
move forward or not.

269
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:51,790
OK. So, first of all...

270
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,510
I don't regret it.
I don't regret anything,

271
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,600
I make a point of not
regretting things.

272
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:01,840
However... You've slept with John.

273
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,870
I was pissed.

274
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,070
It was my birthday.
I felt sorry for him,

275
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:13,640
for being such a...twat,
he looked so pathetic.

276
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,880
Oh, you really have slept with John?

277
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,400
What was it like?

278
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,760
To be honest...

279
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:38,350
..I don't actually remember
very much about it,

280
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,840
except that it happened.

281
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:42,920
Right.

282
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:48,510
Are you...hating me?

283
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,560
No.

284
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:55,390
I didn't want you to find out later
from someone else and think there was

285
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,710
any more to it than there was,

286
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,790
because there wasn't,
there really wasn't.

287
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,870
It was one of those things you do
and after you go,

288
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,510
"God, why did I do that?!"

289
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,120
And the truth is...

290
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,400
..I was pissed.

291
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,230
I don't even fancy him.

292
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,640
I mean, you know, I don't mind him,
but...

293
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:21,790
Oh, I'm daring to hope that this
isn't going down too badly

294
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,790
judging by the expression
on your face.

295
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,590
I'm pleased you told me.
It won't happen again.

296
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,830
No, no...you can have him.
I don't want him.

297
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,070
He's got a good income.
I don't care.

298
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,440
CAROLINE LAUGHS

299
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,590
Do you hate me? No.

300
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,030
Are you laughing at me or with me?

301
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:47,150
I don't know, I'm just...I'm...
I don't know, just laughing.

302
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:52,190
You're thinking, "Braindead,
low-life, trailer trash," aren't you?

303
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,030
Yeah.

304
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,960
But that's cos I'm a snotty bitch.

305
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,350
It's good that you're taking it
so well.

306
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:08,070
Maybe you're in shock. Maybe the
implications haven't sunk in yet.

307
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,910
Are there any?

308
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,630
You're not pregnant, are you?

309
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:15,600
No! That really would
thicken the plot.

310
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,760
So, um...

311
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,720
..when was this?

312
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:30,470
Night me dad and your mum drove
back over to Harrogate.

313
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,110
When he'd, you know, John had
spilled the beans to her about you.

314
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,320
Our birthday.

315
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,280
God. Right.

316
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:44,070
When I was propping
Judith up in casualty.

317
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,350
Were you?

318
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,720
Blimey.

319
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,960
"Are we cool, Vincent?"

320
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,830
Is that from something?

321
00:18:58,840 --> 00:18:59,880
Pulp Fiction.

322
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:05,320
I'm Samuel L Jackson
and you're John Travolta.

323
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,680
Right.

324
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:13,750
Then we go out and shoot
some students, I think.

325
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,400
Unless I've misremembered.

326
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,200
Blimey.

327
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,710
I can't help thinking how
different things would've

328
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:34,190
been now if he hadn't
pulled through. Oh, Celia!

329
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:38,390
Well, you don't need to
think about that now, do you?

330
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,310
I think the world of you two.

331
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,360
You both know that, don't you?
Aww!

332
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,790
I'll get t'kettle on.

333
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:12,950
Where's little what's-his-name
with the broken leg?

334
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:17,990
Paul? I got shot of him.
I took him to his granny's.

335
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,840
Sit down, get warm.

336
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:26,750
I might get back off home, Mum.

337
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,790
Oh, I thought you were stopping.

338
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:31,590
I've left John at home with the
boys, which I'm not thrilled about.

339
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,710
I don't want him to think I need
him for anything, because I don't.

340
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,190
He rang earlier, John.
I don't know why.

341
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:41,310
Oh, to say you'd set off.
Seemed like an excuse.

342
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:44,590
He asked to speak to Gillian.
I don't know why.

343
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,390
I've been thinking.

344
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:50,110
How would you feel if,
when he comes out of hospital,

345
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:53,510
we came to live at my little flat?

346
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,990
I'd feel fine about it.
You see, the thing is,

347
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,270
you know my dad died of a heart
attack, climbing the stairs.

348
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:02,950
The doctor told him not to
and my mother, of course, said,

349
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:06,830
"Oh, you'll be all right,"
and that was it.

350
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,680
He'd not want to contradict her.

351
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,110
He went as white as a sheet.

352
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:17,550
Mum, it's your home.
It's absolutely fine by me.

353
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,470
What does Gillian think?

354
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:23,750
See, I've no stairs,
and it's nothing but stairs here,

355
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,790
and steep ones at that.

356
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,000
OK.

357
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,830
I've not broached him with it yet,
never mind Gillian.

358
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:34,910
He might have other ideas. OK.

359
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,240
Right.

360
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,750
Is everybody warm enough?

361
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:43,110
I'm going to...get, er...going.

362
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,350
OK.

363
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:48,950
I've a pile of paperwork to get
through and...

364
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,870
Ring me if you want anything.

365
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,120
I'll see you... I'll see you out...
Sure.

366
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,920
See you. See ya.

367
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:07,400
Are you all right? Yeah.

368
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:13,600
Is there something up between you
and Gillian?

369
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,800
She slept with John.

370
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:26,470
She just told me. That night,
my birthday, her birthday,

371
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,040
when he was over here
shooting his mouth off.

372
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:34,230
You and Alan set off over to
Harrogate, I was propping

373
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:39,110
Judith up in casualty and
they ended up in bed together.

374
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,310
I mean, she's told me
cos she feels bad about it

375
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:44,160
and she was drunk and she wishes it
hadn't happened, but...

376
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:50,550
I don't know.
How do people do that?

377
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:54,110
Why is everything so casual
and meaningless and...?

378
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,270
I can't leave.
I need to be near him.

379
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:59,030
No, I didn't...

380
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:02,190
I know that, I don't expect you to.

381
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:05,710
I was... Sorry, I just think I'm
a little bit shocked, that's all.

382
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,920
Don't say anything. No.

383
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,150
Do you think
before Judith, John was...?

384
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,480
At it with all and sundry?

385
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,160
Like your dad?

386
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,400
I don't know, love.

387
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,920
Ring me. Yes.

388
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,190
Don't say anything.

389
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,520
No, don't worry.

390
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,440
Everything all right? Hmm.

391
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:10,270
I thought I might turn in early,
if it's all right? Sure.

392
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:13,030
Course. You...
do what you need to do.

393
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,080
That for me? Yeah.

394
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,590
Is it all right if I...?

395
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,280
Course.

396
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,430
Night-night, love.

397
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,280
Night-night.

398
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,630
Ready, Mr Buttershaw?

399
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:14,030
I've been ready since six o'clock
this morning.

400
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:18,310
Have you heck?!
Not sat there, in your coat.

401
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:21,510
Still, wouldn't be the first time
you'd kept me waiting.

402
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,750
THEY CHUCKLE

403
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:29,070
You're never going to let that drop,
are you? I might do one day,

404
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,920
if you play your cards right.

405
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:02,310
I resolved, the first time it
happened, that I was going to live

406
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,630
life differently and I did,
on the whole.

407
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:10,440
I got in touch with you,
didn't I, for instance? But now...

408
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:16,350
Now you're going to take things
steady. No. God, no.

409
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:19,630
Now I'm going to really
start living.

410
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:22,670
What do you think I'm doing
sat up here?

411
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:26,680
Well, you know what the consultant
just said. Oh, bugger that.

412
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:31,070
OK. So what've you got planned?

413
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:35,350
Anything. All sorts. Such as?

414
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:40,360
Have you ever fancied skiing?
No. Have you?

415
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,790
HE LAUGHS
Oh, you!

416
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:47,190
Never! Good.

417
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,710
Well, that's that dealt with, then.

418
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:53,910
We used to come up here on bikes.

419
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:56,990
Me and Maurice and Harry
and Joe Riley.

420
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,750
You could get all t'way to Greetland
from top o' Barkisland

421
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,430
without pedalling once.

422
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:07,150
I know you could because... It were
like floating through the air.

423
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:10,190
Because me and Eileen and
Doreen Wilkinson

424
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:15,670
and our Muriel used to do just
the same. Did you? Yeah, yeah.

425
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:18,990
I always used to think you were
a bit smitten with Joe Riley.

426
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,670
Joe?!

427
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:24,550
No. Although he was very
good-looking.

428
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:28,550
I always thought he had
a look of Errol Flynn, but clever.

429
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,990
He went to work for NASA, didn't he?
He did!

430
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,670
He were made a Fellow of the
Royal Society, then off he went

431
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:41,030
to Altadena, California.
Brain drain. He were my best man...

432
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:45,510
when Eileen and I got wed.
Oh. Do you keep in touch?

433
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:52,150
We did. Every Christmas, and the
occasional letter in-between.

434
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,430
He popped over once or twice

435
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,990
to see his mother,
but we always caught up.

436
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,400
I always fancied popping over there,
but it never happened.

437
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,560
He had Parkinson's at finish.

438
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:12,110
We came up here to
scatter my dad's ashes,

439
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:14,710
me and me mum.

440
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:19,670
We drove over from Sheffield and
we had Caroline in the pushchair.

441
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:20,920
1969.

442
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:26,950
He loved up here, me dad.

443
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,870
It was a right farce.

444
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,070
We thought it would be like powder,

445
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:33,750
but it wasn't,
it was more like grit,

446
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:37,710
granules, and it got everywhere.

447
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:41,070
We just couldn't get rid of it. Him.

448
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:45,390
We hadn't thought it through.
Well, she hadn't, me mother.

449
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:50,990
And we hadn't got permission.
Well, we didn't know you needed it.

450
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,320
Perhaps you didn't then.
I don't know.

451
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:59,760
I don't know what my mum and dad
would've thought about me and you.

452
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:04,870
Actually, I do.
They'd have been over the moon.

453
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:07,120
They'd have been thrilled to
bits with you.

454
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,680
Do you fancy a pint?

455
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,270
It's only just gone half-past 11!

456
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:18,550
You've only been out of hospital
half an hour!

457
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:21,270
So what? You know damn well so what.

458
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:27,510
Do you fancy popping over to the
Registry Office first, then?

459
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:32,230
Are we serious,
about not telling anyone

460
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:36,520
till it's all over and done with?
Well, I am, yeah.

461
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:19,960
So that's a fortnight tomorrow
at 11am.

462
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,800
Shall I put that on a card for you?

463
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,870
Well, it's a good job you texted me

464
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,630
or I'd have been wondering
where you were.

465
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:04,110
Is it wise to go gallivanting when
you've only just been discharged?

466
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:08,710
I just wanted to see Ladstone Rock
and then we fancied a pint.

467
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:13,590
Oh, so you went via Aberdeen?
That's right.

468
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,710
Have you set a date? Sorry?
For the wedding?

469
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:20,230
Oh, no, love. No.

470
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:23,550
Alan needs to concentrate on
getting fit again first

471
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:26,110
before we start
thinking of anything like that.

472
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,830
Shall we get t'kettle on?

473
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:31,800
And then me and Celia have got
something to run past you.

474
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,270
Harrogate? I've no stairs.

475
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:42,990
And you're out on the farm all day,
or down at the shop,

476
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,470
whereas I can see to him 24/7.

477
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,920
That's what I'm thinking.

478
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:50,670
Well, that's very kind of you, but...

479
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,830
And it's not like it's for ever.

480
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:56,430
I mean, we do intend to buy.
Eventually.

481
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:59,030
OK. And soon.

482
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:02,510
And when we do, it'll more than
likely be round here.

483
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:04,430
Well, we've not discussed that yet.

484
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,790
No, no, but...

485
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:10,350
And it's not a million miles away,
Harrogate, is it?

486
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,630
No, it's not but...

487
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:16,390
And you'd be more than welcome,
any time you fancied, to pop over.

488
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:19,230
It is very nice, the house

489
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,950
and Celia's little flat.

490
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,800
I'm sure it is, Dad. I just...

491
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,550
So when were you thinking of...

492
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:31,070
Tomorrow.

493
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:35,630
Tomorrow? Does Caroline know...?

494
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,830
She's fine about it.

495
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,160
I see.

496
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:43,430
So...

497
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:46,560
Well, it just seems a bit sudden.

498
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,310
But... Well,

499
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:50,870
yeah, if it's what you want.

500
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,750
I thought it'd be
a weight off your mind.

501
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,350
You'll be 60 miles away.

502
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:58,870
Oh, no.
It's actually more like 40.

503
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,430
40, 60.

504
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:02,990
He'll be in good hands.

505
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,870
Yeah, I understand that, Celia.

506
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:09,390
You'll have to pretend
I'm on holiday.

507
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,670
Right.

508
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,230
But...

509
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:16,750
how about if I popped over with you?

510
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:20,030
Just quickly, just tomorrow,
just to make sure you're... Yeah.

511
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:22,270
..settled in all right
and everything's...

512
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:24,710
Sure.

513
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:29,040
Right. I'll get the kettle on.

514
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:39,990
I've got my new hat.
So that's that bit covered.

515
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,990
Something old, something new...

516
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,190
Something old we've not got.

517
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,190
Well, we're both old.

518
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:50,950
Are we? Well, you are, I'm not.

519
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,950
THEY CHUCKLE

520
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:56,710
I started counting backwards
when I got to 36.

521
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:00,110
So how old does that make
you now then?

522
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,950
Minus three.

523
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,550
Fancy.

524
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:07,630
We had a very interesting
experience in 1988,

525
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:11,710
when me and our Caroline
were both 22.

526
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:14,670
That must have taken
some explaining.

527
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:16,550
Not really.

528
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:19,790
Something borrowed...

529
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:26,350
I could borrow a bow tie off
Maurice. Then I'd be very dapper.

530
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:29,030
You could and you would, but then
he'd want to know why you were

531
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,270
borrowing it. You know what
a nosy old bugger he is.

532
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:34,710
I could lie. I could say I'd been
invited to a cocktail party.

533
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:36,750
In Manhattan.

534
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,230
Mmm, he'd believe that.

535
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:40,830
Only he might want to come with me.

536
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:44,030
Tell him to sod off. OK.

537
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,190
Something blue.

538
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:49,110
A mucky magazine?

539
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:51,590
Have you got any?

540
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,870
No. Have you?

541
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:56,190
Oh, yeah, got loads(!)

542
00:34:56,200 --> 00:35:00,590
THEY LAUGH

543
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,440
No, I haven't.

544
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,720
CELIA AND ALAN LAUGH UPSTAIRS

545
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,400
She slept with John.

546
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:59,710
Who? Gillian.

547
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:01,830
That night when we drove over here,

548
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:05,030
and he'd been there shooting
his mouth off about Caroline

549
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,470
batting for the other side...

550
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,510
Slept with him?!

551
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:10,680
Had...sex with him.

552
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,230
How do you know?

553
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:15,150
Caroline told me.

554
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:16,590
Well, how does she know?

555
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:19,110
Gillian. Told her, apparently.

556
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:21,910
What for?

557
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:26,800
Well, because... I don't know.
I think because she regretted it.

558
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:33,160
I don't know why I've told you.
Well, except it's bothered me.

559
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,590
Sorry. I don't want to
burden you with it.

560
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:40,070
It's not... I'm not...

561
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:44,110
I'm just a bit befuddled with it
myself really.

562
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:49,190
And plus, I don't want to see her
get hurt. Gillian.

563
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:54,160
God! He's a bugger is John.

564
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:04,150
Gillian's coming! Gillian? Yes!

565
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,550
And Kate's here.

566
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:09,830
What's...? What's Gillian
coming here for?

567
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:13,590
Would you like some tea?
Ooh. Hi, John.

568
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,830
What's Gillian coming here for?

569
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:20,390
Alan's moving into my mum's to
recuperate and I think she wants to
see him settled in.

570
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:23,110
So, is...is she staying...long?

571
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:25,870
I don't know.
You'll have to ask her yourself.

572
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:28,270
Oh, and Kate's moving in.

573
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,110
I'll get my things out of the car.

574
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:33,870
Lawrence, can you help Kate
with her things?

575
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:35,710
That's... You can't expect me...

576
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:38,390
She's got her own house, what does
she want to move in here for?

577
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,470
John, after I came back here
on Saturday night

578
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:44,550
and found what I found, I'm amazed
you could begin to imagine that

579
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:47,310
you have anything to say at all
about what other people do.

580
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:49,470
Judith... Judith needs help.

581
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:52,350
Judith and I are not an item.
Well, you could've fooled me!

582
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:57,030
I will not be made to feel like a
sodding gooseberry in my own house.

583
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:00,040
That-that-that was...
You have nothing to say.

584
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,880
What time are they getting here?

585
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:23,790
Blimey.

586
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:27,600
My little apartment's
round the back, Gillian.

587
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,160
Done all right for yourself here,
Dad, eh?

588
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,590
What's up?

589
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:39,750
I thought we were plumbing depths
with Susan Jatri's lad, but John?

590
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:42,470
He's practically
your brother-in-law.

591
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:45,270
And I thought you told me you and
Robbie were more or less an item?

592
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,510
How did...? Who...?

593
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:49,190
Celia told me. Caroline told her.

594
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:52,710
You... I told Caroline
because I felt bad about it.

595
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:57,470
I was pissed, it was my birthday.
Me and Robbie are...

596
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:59,910
Are we going in? Yeah, let me.

597
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,920
I'll lead the way.

598
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:07,350
It didn't mean anything.
It was rubbish, it was ridiculous.

599
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:09,440
I just felt sorry for him.

600
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:13,550
You're a...

601
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:15,960
What am I? Come on!
Don't hold back!

602
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:19,070
..a pillock!

603
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:23,310
Oh, OK. I thought you were going
to say something worse. I was.

604
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,600
Yeah! Whatever.

605
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:29,070
I've put my things in your bedroom.

606
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:32,070
Is that...? Of course it is.

607
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,480
How permanent is this?

608
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:38,510
We need to sit down and have
the conversation properly,

609
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:43,710
and not when we've been rushed
into it, but it's... Yeah. If...

610
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:49,670
If... Yeah. If it's what you want.

611
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:51,120
Do you need to ask?

612
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:55,790
PHONE RINGS

613
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:59,750
Hello?
'We're back, we've arrived.'

614
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:03,190
Good! They've arrived.
I'll pop round.

615
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,230
There's something
I need to tell you.

616
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:06,630
'Right. Ta-ta.'

617
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:09,200
She's popping round.

618
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:13,920
What's up?

619
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:18,390
It's just a disappointment,
isn't it?

620
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,230
An ongoing disappointment.

621
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:24,470
And for the record, he is not
my brother-in-law because, A,

622
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:29,830
you're not married yet, and two - him
and Caroline are getting divorced.

623
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:33,710
Ipso-facto, QED,
NOT my brother-in-law.

624
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:35,790
I said not to say anything.

625
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,350
Aye. Well, I did.

626
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:41,790
Can we all just get it into our
little heads that I regret it

627
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:45,270
and it won't happen again?
Would you like that written down?

628
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,030
In triplicate?

629
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:50,240
What for? It wouldn't mean owt.

630
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,750
Dad, I'm going to get upset.

631
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:56,870
Well, what do you expect?

632
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,600
She were pregnant when she were 15.

633
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:06,750
Dad! Broke Eileen's heart.
Perhaps you didn't know that.

634
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:08,830
KNOCK ON DOOR

635
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:12,950
Hi! Alan!

636
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,920
Hello, love.
How was your journey?

637
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:24,560
It was fine.
Good! Is everything...?

638
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:28,390
I'll put the kettle on in a minute.
I'm cooking for everyone.

639
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,470
It'll be about half an hour
if that's...

640
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,480
Perfect, love.
Smashing.

641
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:39,110
So, I just need to...tell you
something.

642
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:42,550
Kate's here. You're going to have to
bear with me. I didn't plan this

643
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:46,190
exactly to coincide...
Only, when I got back here

644
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,840
on Saturday night, Judith was here.

645
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:58,390
Ahh!

646
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,390
Oh!

647
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:04,070
Oh, Jesus!

648
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:11,230
Shit! I thought... He said you were
in... Where is it? Huddersfield.

649
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:14,830
Halifax.

650
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:17,350
What's the matter? What's happened?

651
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:20,870
You've not fallen down the stairs
again have you, you silly cow?

652
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:24,710
Caroline's here. What?
Caroline's here! What?

653
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,910
CAROLINE'S...
Caroline's in Halifax.

654
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:28,790
Where are the boys?

655
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:32,030
They're around. What are you doing
here? You're supposed to be...

656
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:34,910
They've been playing music really
loud and making loads of noise,

657
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:39,190
and they were throwing stuff around
in the kitchen and then they went
upstairs in your bedroom!

658
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:43,790
That kid needs to lighten up.
We thought you were going to be away
all night.

659
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:46,830
Oh, God, don't snivel!
It's hardly that...bad.

660
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:48,830
Get your coats on, get into my car.

661
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:51,750
I'll be back in the morning
and I don't care how you do it,

662
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:53,910
but that kitchen better
be as spotless as it was

663
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:56,550
when I left here this afternoon.

664
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:58,670
Oi, you have friends round,

665
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:00,750
I have friends round.

666
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:02,910
You've traumatised our children.

667
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:06,350
I have? What about you?
You've scarred them for life!

668
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:09,670
Do you know what? I'm actually
starting to feel a bit queasy.

669
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:12,630
This is nothing compared to what
you're actively

670
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:15,030
inflicting on them,
you mad old dyke!

671
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:18,390
And bollocks to you with your
"this kitchen better be spotless".

672
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:21,870
I don't know why I'm bothering to
remind you, but I will.

673
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:26,470
This house... This house was paid
for almost entirely with money

674
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:29,110
I earned when I was
on the bestseller list! So f...

675
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:31,520
JUDITH VOMITS

676
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:36,310
I'll see you in the morning. Yeah.

677
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:38,470
Whatever.

678
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:42,470
So, I took the boys round
to Kate's for the night

679
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:46,590
and, um...John was pretty appalled,
to be fair to him,

680
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:48,270
on Sunday morning.

681
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:50,030
He had tried to tidy the kitchen up,

682
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:52,790
but he wasn't really in any
fit state to stand up

683
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:56,630
for any length of time
until the early evening,
so I had to help him.

684
00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:00,310
Then I asked him
if he would move out,

685
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:02,390
so that we can all move on
with our lives,

686
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,750
but he's still refusing to do that.

687
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:06,750
So I have asked Kate to move in

688
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:10,390
in the hope that, at some point,
he will get the message.

689
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:14,320
So that's why Kate's here, OK?

690
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:26,360
Where's Caroline? Next door.

691
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:31,990
Is...Gillian staying for supper?

692
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,240
I don't know.

693
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:37,990
What are you...cooking?

694
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:42,470
It's... Erm...I don't know.
Caroline's in charge, I'm just...

695
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:44,790
What's she doing next door? I...

696
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:49,080
God, I can't stand this!
This is my house, I live here.

697
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:54,270
Is she...? She'd better not be.
What?

698
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:57,430
Telling people things about me.

699
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:00,070
I'm not going to be made to
feel like...

700
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:03,270
whatever in my own house.

701
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:06,680
I...have no opinion on that.

702
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:14,550
He's a mess is John.

703
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:17,480
As long as nobody's under
any illusions.

704
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:23,110
Caroline, I'm going to get off home.

705
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:24,160
OK.

706
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:29,910
Ring me if you want anything.

707
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:31,550
Right.

708
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:34,240
Right. Thanks, Celia.

709
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:36,800
OK, love.

710
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:45,600
I'll...

711
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:56,680
Gillian?
Sorry, I need to get home.

712
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:03,350
What's the matter? Nothing.
Come inside. No. No, I'll...

713
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:05,750
Well... What's happened?

714
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:08,510
It's fine. It's fine.
I'm just leaving him here,

715
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:11,110
60, 40 miles from home and...

716
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:14,190
She'll look after him.
I know that.

717
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:17,990
And I'll keep an eye on everything.
I know. I know you will.

718
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,910
You can come here any time you like.
I know. I know.

719
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:23,680
Why did you tell your mum?

720
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:28,390
Is that what's...?

721
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:32,880
She's told me dad and he's...
Did she? I'm sorry, I just...

722
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:39,990
I just couldn't... Just couldn't...

723
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:44,350
No, don't. It's all my own stupid
fault anyway, isn't it?

724
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:46,280
Is he upset?

725
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:50,270
Oh, God. I'm sorry.

726
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:51,320
No, it's...

727
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:57,430
He said something about me mum.

728
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:58,480
That's all.

729
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,200
I broke her heart apparently.

730
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:04,920
When I was 15.

731
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:09,590
Well, I did. I know I did.

732
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:10,790
I got pregnant.

733
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:14,950
I had to leave school at the time.
You know, I went back...

734
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:18,440
later to do my A-levels,
but...it never worked out, so...

735
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:24,150
All very disappointing for them.

736
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:26,880
So, yup, that's me.

737
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:29,190
You had a baby?

738
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:32,240
No! No. A-Abortion.

739
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:37,630
Sorry. I am sorry. I don't know why
I told her, I just...

740
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:41,550
had it on my brain and, you know,
she's me mum, and...

741
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:44,150
Well, it'll blow over.
Yeah. Will it?

742
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:47,680
Just bad timing. With his...
Yeah. Sorry.

743
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:51,710
I'll get off. I'll ring you.

744
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:54,430
I wasn't accusing you. I just...
I'm sorry.

745
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:56,600
Not your fault. Really not.

746
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:05,240
Why am I apologising?

747
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:11,360
Sanctimonious b...

748
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:42,070
Gillian! Shit!

749
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:43,470
I need to talk to you.

750
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:45,950
Yeah, well, I don't need to
talk to you!

751
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:50,310
In fact, right now...
I can't.....you're the last...

752
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:52,670
You can't treat people like this.

753
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:56,350
You can't ignore my texts and
hang up on me on the phone.

754
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:59,830
Can you get out of my Land Rover,
please? We had sex.

755
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:02,910
Yes, we did.
And, boy, am I paying for it now?!

756
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:05,790
You came onto me. Not! So
forgive me... Yes, you did. You...

757
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:08,990
I tentatively explained that
I had feelings for you.

758
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,830
You said, "Shall we go upstairs?"
So forgive me for thinking that

759
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:14,670
we'd embarked upon some sort of
relationship. OK. Right. Right.

760
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:17,430
So, please, can you explain why,
Saturday afternoon,

761
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:18,950
you're on the phone saying,

762
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:22,670
"I think I might be a little bit in
love with you, Gillian," and then,

763
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:26,830
the same night, you're here,
in bed with Judith apparently,

764
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:29,070
who you claim to hate.

765
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:32,350
She told you. Caroline. She...
Yes! Well, isn't it obvious?

766
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:34,830
Not to me!
I'm floundering.

767
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:38,270
What? You won't speak to me,
she's decided she's a dyke,

768
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:39,670
the boys think I'm ridiculous.

769
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:42,990
Oh, no. They don't. Do they?

770
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:46,230
I've got nothing. She's moved her
insipid little girlfriend in

771
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:48,830
and her mad mother...
Oi, steady on.

772
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:54,430
I bought that house and now I'm
the one who... Oh, shit!

773
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:56,310
I'm going to have to knock
to get back in.

774
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:58,710
SHE GIGGLES
Aw-w! Bless.

775
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:01,110
Yeah, it's all so funny, isn't it?

776
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:02,630
Sorry.
SHE LAUGHS

777
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:06,230
I'm all over the place, I can't
think straight, and then... God!

778
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:10,550
I end up in another tawdry mess
with that ridiculous woman
in front of the children.

779
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:14,350
You know, people commit suicide
with less than this eating away
inside their brain.

780
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:16,870
Is it...that bad?

781
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:18,520
My publisher's dropped me.

782
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,520
Why?

783
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:27,880
It's being brewing for a while.
I got an e-mail last week.

784
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:35,070
Well...is there someone you can
talk to about it?

785
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:37,990
No, not really. It's not something
you want to tell to just anyone.

786
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,070
And my agent...he's not
returned my calls, so that's...

787
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:43,630
You see, before,
Caroline would've been really...

788
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:45,310
good about something like that.

789
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:47,510
She'd have put it in a context.

790
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:50,110
She'd have thrown a light
on it that...

791
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:53,030
She can be a really good person
to have in your corner.

792
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:56,360
Yeah, well, shame you were
unfaithful to her.

793
00:50:57,760 --> 00:50:58,910
Sorry.

794
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:01,280
Everything's just such a mess.

795
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:06,920
What did you mean when you said,
"And, boy, am I paying for it now"?

796
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:11,070
Well... OK. They all know.

797
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:14,080
That we... Do they?

798
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:21,190
Do they? Well, is that...

799
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:24,910
such a bad thing?
Couldn't we...?

800
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:30,270
No. It was a mistake,
it should never have happened.

801
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:32,870
I have to go, John.

802
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:35,150
I'm sorry about your publisher

803
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:38,470
but, you know, we've all
got crosses to bear.

804
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:41,110
I don't know how much longer
I can afford to keep the farm going,

805
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:43,590
way things are at the moment. Why?

806
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:46,190
Oh...money. Really?

807
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:47,320
That's my problem.

808
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:51,590
So...what if I...popped over

809
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:53,750
some time? Would that be...

810
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:55,910
completely...?

811
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:57,990
I'm seeing Robbie.

812
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,630
I thought you hated Robbie.

813
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:01,560
Yeah, I thought you hated Judith.

814
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:15,720
HE KNOCKS ON WINDOW

815
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:32,320
What are you doing outside?
I... Does it matter?

816
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:40,550
Do you want something to eat?

817
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:43,680
Is there enough?
You'll have to find a chair.

818
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:02,390
Hello.

819
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:04,390
Hi, Alan. How's...? Are you...?

820
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:07,350
Oh, fighting fit.

821
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:10,270
Good. That's good. That's...

822
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:12,630
Would you like...?

823
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:14,440
Well, perhaps just a small one.

824
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:19,640
I'll get you a glass.

825
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:38,520
Come by!

826
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:41,600
Away! Away!

827
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:49,880
SHE WHISTLES

828
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:57,040
Can you sit down, please?

829
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:01,470
On you go. Come on.

830
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:02,680
BELL RINGS

831
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:09,280
STUDENTS SING

832
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:17,200
In you go.

833
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:46,760
PHONE VIBRATES
Oh, sorry.

834
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:49,560
Oh, I've got to take this.

835
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,910
Hello, Gillian.
'You busy?'

836
00:54:57,920 --> 00:54:59,790
I'm in a meeting.

837
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:02,470
All right. Well, I'm sorry,
but this might be urgent.

838
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:04,310
Why?

839
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:05,710
Where's me dad and Celia?

840
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:09,190
Well, erm...at home
as far as I know.

841
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:11,520
They... So, you've...

842
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:15,310
So no-one's been...

843
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:19,990
I've found a card,
behind a cushion,

844
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:25,190
'on our settee. It's from
Calderdale Registry Office.

845
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:27,670
'An appointment card.
They've got an appointment'

846
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:31,230
to get married at...11 o'clock
this morning.

847
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:32,510
You're kidding!

848
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:34,590
Have they...?

849
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:36,550
Have they not said anything to you?

850
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:37,990
'No.'

851
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,550
Er...no.

852
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:43,350
I've tried his mobile,
I've tried hers.

853
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:45,150
I can be there if you can.

854
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:49,310
I'll probably overtake them
on the M62. The little buggers!

855
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:53,470
But...presumably, they don't
want us there

856
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:56,950
and, presumably, that's the point.

857
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:59,240
'Has he not said
anything to you at all?'

858
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:03,950
I've spoken to him twice
on the phone...

859
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:07,630
'in the last two weeks
since he came to live at yours,

860
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:09,230
'all of it very perfunctory.'

861
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:13,550
Not exactly flavour of the month
at the moment, am I?

862
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:14,960
'What, still?'

863
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:19,270
'It's just a bit much, isn't it?'

864
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:22,710
Our parents are getting married and
they don't even want us there.

865
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:25,150
Perhaps they don't want a fuss.

866
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:27,230
SHE SCOFFS

867
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:29,950
Gillian, I'm going to have to go.
I'm chairing a meeting.

868
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:32,350
Right. Sorry, is that all right?
Can I ring you...?

869
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:33,760
(Bi...)

870
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:11,630
Shall we get married
and not tell anyone?

871
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:14,870
'You doing anything this weekend?'
What did you have in mind? All sorts.

872
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:18,790
I want a baby.
SHE LAUGHS

873
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:20,550
No.

874
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:23,230
No, Caroline, I'm serious.

875
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:25,430
Just keep pushing, love!
keep pushing.

876
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:28,550
Keep squeezing Grandad's hand.
He's not me grandad!

877
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:31,990
We'd have never carried on like that
at that age, would we?

878
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,790
Don't go, Dad.

879
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:38,470
I don't know how you could fashion
talking to your dad like this,

880
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:41,150
when you know how poorly he's been.

881
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:42,640
Pow.
