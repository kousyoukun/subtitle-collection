1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:04,030
That is the most selfish,
mindless piece of driving

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:05,070
I have ever witnessed.

3
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:06,910
Keep your hair on,
I'll be under 60 seconds.

4
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:08,510
Idiot. Snotty bitch.

5
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:12,070
Some braindead, lowlife, trailer
trash stole my parking space.

6
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,070
And you've met my daughter? Sorry?

7
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:17,350
Now then, we've got some
news for you.

8
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:19,080
We're getting married.

9
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,160
You're very pretty.
You're magnificent.

10
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:31,710
This marriage is over!
It is dead! It is redundant!

11
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:33,510
It never was!

12
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:34,910
We made love.

13
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,230
It was my birthday,
we were both a bit pissed.

14
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:41,950
'He's in hospital. He were rushed in
last night. He had a heart attack.'

15
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:45,030
Did I come to see you last night?

16
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:47,590
Alan? Or were I dreaming?

17
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:53,670
Yes, you did. You came to see me.

18
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,360
I love you.

19
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,150
He's come round,
he's regained consciousness.

20
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,910
'Oh, Mum!'

21
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,750
Gillian's just in with him just
now. She's just chatting to him.

22
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,520
Alan's come round.

23
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,790
'And are they...?'

24
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,590
Is he, erm...? Are they
confident he's going to...?

25
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:07,630
Well, I mean, it's early days
but he seems very perky.

26
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,550
'You mustn't tire him.'

27
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,400
I'm not going to tire him!

28
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,000
I love you.

29
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,320
I love you.

30
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,470
I think I love Celia as well.

31
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,550
So do I.

32
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,400
Hey, you can keep your hands off
her. She's mine.

33
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,950
What are you going to do?

34
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,110
Are you going to stay with us here,
or are you...?

35
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:46,110
Oh, I think I'd like to be on hand
over the next few days,

36
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,790
just till we know what's what.
I mean, if that's...

37
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,350
It's wonderful, it's perfect.

38
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:53,670
Do you want me to drive over to
Harrogate, fetch any of your things?

39
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,670
No, no. You don't want to be
setting off, you need to be here.

40
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,150
No, I'll get Lady Muck to bring over
a few bits and pieces.

41
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,670
She won't mind.

42
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,070
Celia... What?

43
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,470
I just... Can I just...

44
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,110
What, love?

45
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,190
..hug you? Oh!

46
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,590
Thank you.

47
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,750
Thank you for making him so happy

48
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,870
and thank you for bringing him back.

49
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:21,430
Do you know? I think I did.

50
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,790
No, I know you did.

51
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,550
Now, you mustn't fall out
with him again.

52
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,630
Oh, well, it was him
that fell out with me.

53
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,110
Yeah, well, whatever.
You know what I'm saying.

54
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,830
I am never going to fall out with
him again.

55
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:38,680
Ever! About anything.

56
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,390
There you go, ladies.

57
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,270
You're a gem, and a star.
Thanks, love.

58
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:07,150
I've penned that ewe up on her own
in t'barn and I've made a lasagne.

59
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:10,630
There's enough for everybody,
if Caroline wants something when she
gets here.

60
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,830
Have you any idea how good
he's been?

61
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,870
It's ME. Are you packing me
that suitcase?

62
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,510
I have packed you that suitcase.

63
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:21,390
Robbie says he'll have a bit of
supper ready for you when you get
here, if you like.

64
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,110
'Oh, that's lovely.'

65
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,790
Thank you, tell him. 'And Gillian
says you're welcome to stop

66
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,750
'the night, if you don't fancy
turning round

67
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:31,790
'and driving straight back.'
OK. Great. Why not?

68
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,510
So we'll see you in a bit.

69
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,550
Yeah, bye. 'Drive carefully.'

70
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,510
Yeah, I will. Bye-bye.

71
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:41,950
Why don't I pop over with her
bits and pieces? You?

72
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:45,510
Well, it'll save you time and...
The best thing you can do,
if you want to be useful,

73
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,870
is stay here with the boys
cos I might stay over there.

74
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,790
Why? Well, just tonight. Why not?

75
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,070
They're old enough to...
why don't I come with you?

76
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,190
Come... What for?

77
00:04:56,200 --> 00:05:01,070
Well, so I can apologise
to everyone for...

78
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,950
Well, it was all my fault,
wasn't it? How?

79
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:07,710
Well, if I hadn't told Celia about
you being...

80
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:10,790
And then if she hadn't reacted
so badly to that,

81
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,630
Alan wouldn't have seen how

82
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:15,350
small-minded and bigoted
she...can be

83
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,670
and then if they hadn't
fallen out about that,

84
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:22,030
he might not have got upset
and had...had...had the...

85
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,200
the heart attack.

86
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,110
But it really is all about you,
isn't it?

87
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,430
That's... That's just...

88
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:31,230
When I get back, we really do need
to work out what's what

89
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:34,790
and whose is what
and all the rest of it.

90
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,630
Boys!

91
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:40,920
I'm off over to Halifax.

92
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,880
Dad's going to be here.

93
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:49,200
I'm on my mobile if you want me.
I'll see you later.

94
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:20,160
Mum, you've got a text.

95
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,070
'Halifax?'

96
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,110
Yeah! He's come round,
he's regained consciousness.

97
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,350
'Oh!'

98
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:59,870
Yeah, he's going to be fine.
Well, we hope.

99
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,470
'That's...' I know.

100
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,920
..fantastic.
'So I'll be back tomorrow.'

101
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:11,310
Oh. So, we're not doing anything
tonight, then?

102
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,520
Well, we left it up in the air,
didn't we?

103
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,630
So, is that all right?

104
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:20,720
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, course.

105
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,750
We'll do something tomorrow.

106
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,800
Good.

107
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,310
Can I just check your blood
pressure, Mr Buttershaw?

108
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:37,310
Hm? Oh, yes.

109
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:41,350
How are you feeling?
I'm very happy.

110
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,590
I was watching you.
You and your wife.

111
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,790
You're just so completely in love
with each other, aren't you?

112
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,190
She's not my wife yet.

113
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:51,120
But I do think
we need to get on with it.

114
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:55,470
We are popping up back to the
hospital again, aren't we, Gillian?

115
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:58,510
This evening? Absolutely.
I'd like to.

116
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,950
Do you need me to come?

117
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,270
Why? Have you got plans?

118
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,310
Ellie.

119
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,990
Who? Girlfriend.
She's not my girlfriend.

120
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,350
She running rings round you again?

121
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,270
She's not like that.
What is she like?

122
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,310
She does blow hot and cold.

123
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:16,110
Oh, you don't want that. Life's
too short. We're just mates.

124
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,310
She uses you.
She doesn't use me.

125
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,270
She damn well does! Once.

126
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,910
What happened? Nothing.

127
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,830
They had a date. "Date."

128
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,510
Only she stood him up cos she got
a better offer.

129
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,310
Yeah, nice(!) Bitch.

130
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,790
That ain't what happened. Is.

131
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,510
How would you describe it?

132
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:35,110
Well, I'd be minding
me own business.

133
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,560
John? What's he want?

134
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,670
Hello? 'Celia! Hi.'

135
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,150
'What's up?'

136
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:46,950
Just ringing to let you know that
Caroline's just set off, just now.

137
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,310
Right.

138
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,030
Probably be with you in an
hour, an hour and a half.

139
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,390
Right. 'How is he?'

140
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,990
Alan?

141
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,030
'Well, it's early days,
but he's conscious anyway.

142
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,710
'Didn't she tell you?'

143
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,590
Good. Yes! She did.

144
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:06,110
Is...? Could I...? Is Gillian there?

145
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:10,030
Gillian? Yes, she's here,
and Raff and Robbie.

146
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,470
Could I...? Could I speak to her?
'Gillian?'

147
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,590
Yes. 'What for?'

148
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,910
'Well, just...just...'

149
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,760
It's John.
He's asking to speak to you.

150
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,800
What about?

151
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,990
Hello?

152
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,910
Gillian. 'Yes.'

153
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:28,990
It's John.

154
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,990
Yes.

155
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,510
Hi. Yes?

156
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:37,350
'Look... Sorry.
I realise you're cross with me.'

157
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,670
Am I?

158
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,390
Yeah. Aren't you?

159
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,990
'For getting drunk and making a fuss

160
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,550
'and spilling the beans
about Caroline to Celia and...'

161
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,670
Oh!

162
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,230
..so forth.

163
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,310
Well, it's all water
under t'bridge now, so...

164
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,670
'Good. Good. Is it?'

165
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,350
Gone and forgotten.

166
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,470
Good. Good. Well, that's good.

167
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,590
Bye, then.

168
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,670
No. Wait.

169
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,470
Then, there's the other thing.

170
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,190
The other thing?

171
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,190
'Could we...?
I'd like to see you again.'

172
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,790
Right. Well, that's... That's not...

173
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,710
The thing is. Oh, God.

174
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,710
Hello?

175
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,510
I think I'm a little
bit in love with you.

176
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:23,750
Right. Right. OK.

177
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:30,600
Well. That's...not exactly
my problem as such, is it?

178
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,630
You can't talk. Obviously.

179
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,790
And there is that.

180
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,910
'Maybe... Could we...meet up?

181
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,790
'Somewhere? Sometime?' No.

182
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,190
I don't mind popping over.

183
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,190
Did you get my text message?
Please don't say no.

184
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,990
I don't think I could...

185
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,990
OK, so shall I give you back to
Celia?

186
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,550
'No. No. I don't need to
speak to Celia again.'

187
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,390
No, OK. Ta-ta, then.

188
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,790
Gillian. Gillian. This is...

189
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,350
My dad's in hospital, John.

190
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:03,870
We've got a lot on
just now at this end.

191
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,310
Of course. Course you do.

192
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,630
Sorry. Sure. It's just...

193
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,350
'Boys all right?'

194
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,910
Er...boys are fine.

195
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,830
OK. Bye!

196
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,960
Bye. Bye! Bye-bye.

197
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:29,630
Dad! What's for tea? Nothing.

198
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,400
I don't know.

199
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:49,360
Hi, Judith. It's me.
Are you doing anything this evening?

200
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:54,270
He said I can come home
on Monday, the doctor,

201
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,910
all things being equal.

202
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:59,990
That's...amazing.

203
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,310
What else has he said?

204
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,240
Oh...a few dos and don'ts. Like?

205
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:11,070
Usual. No, come on.

206
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:14,070
No enjoying yourself.
No singing, no dancing,

207
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,390
no fighting, no farting.

208
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,790
Different pills?

209
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,520
No, no. The same.

210
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:25,630
He told me there'd been...

211
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:28,390
damage to the muscle.

212
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:33,430
Yeah. Well, it's...sorted
itself out.

213
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,390
I will be talking to the consultant
myself again, Dad,

214
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:39,550
in case you were thinking about
trying to pull the wool over

215
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,910
anyone's eyes with your
medical rhetoric.

216
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:46,870
Why don't you take Caroline
and see if you can't find
a cup of tea somewhere?

217
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:50,520
Good plan.
We'll see you in a bit, then.

218
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,270
It is nice to see you.

219
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,720
Yeah, it's nice to see you as well,
love.

220
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,480
They do cake.

221
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,950
I've been thinking.
Yeah, so have I.

222
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:15,070
Happen we should...
Just get on with it, the wedding.

223
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,790
Great minds.
Bugger the practicalities...

224
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,950
Like where we might live.
Let's just...

225
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,990
Book a registrar
and get on with it

226
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,430
and worry about everything else
afterwards.

227
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:27,030
What do you think?
What about a venue?

228
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:31,430
I don't know, I don't care.
Neither do I.

229
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,390
We can get married in the car park
at The Dog & Duck for all I care.

230
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:39,670
And...not tell anyone
till it's all over and done with.

231
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,790
Anyone?

232
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,550
Anyone.

233
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:46,950
Well, that'll get round the
best man issue very nicely.

234
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,670
Won't we need witnesses?

235
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,990
There'll be folk passing.

236
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,190
It's appealing to me.

237
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,990
Yes, I can see.

238
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,190
What did the consultant say?

239
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,670
Just what I've said.

240
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,990
Why is it that trying to get
information out of a man

241
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,350
is like trying to get
blood out of a stone?

242
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,030
I'm A1.

243
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,630
Oh, you're not A1,
you've had a heart attack.

244
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,880
(I'm A1.)

245
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,830
I think I was more upset
when I heard about Alan

246
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:21,110
than I was when my dad died.

247
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,230
God, that's an awful thing to say.
Except he had dementia, my dad.

248
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,870
So in some ways... Yeah.
..it was... Yeah...a relief.

249
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:31,160
Do you think people can
die from a broken heart?

250
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:36,360
I thought that was
what was happening.

251
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,270
Course I couldn't say that to
t'consultant. He'd have laughed,

252
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:46,030
or given you that look they do
where they feel sorry for you,

253
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,390
for being thick.

254
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,630
You've probably never had that.

255
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:53,750
Well... How's Kate?

256
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,760
Yeah, she's... She's...

257
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:00,360
What? It's all...

258
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:06,350
Like everybody suddenly knows and
I didn't want it to be like that.

259
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:09,470
I mean, I don't think we know
what we are yet exactly.

260
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:12,790
And everybody's gawping at you
like they're expecting you

261
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,680
to make an announcement. Exactly
that. Sod 'em. Let 'em deal with it.

262
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:21,360
Yeah. Yeah.

263
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,640
I need to tell you this thing.

264
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,160
OK.

265
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,350
You'll probably think I'm a complete
dipstick when I've told you,

266
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:41,630
but I'd rather be upfront about it
and then you know,

267
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:46,270
and then we can either
move forward or not.

268
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:50,790
OK. So, first of all...

269
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,510
I don't regret it.
I don't regret anything,

270
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,600
I make a point of not
regretting things.

271
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:00,840
However... You've slept with John.

272
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,870
I was pissed.

273
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,070
It was my birthday.
I felt sorry for him,

274
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:12,640
for being such a...twat,
he looked so pathetic.

275
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,880
Oh, you really have slept with John?

276
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,400
What was it like?

277
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,760
To be honest...

278
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,350
..I don't actually remember
very much about it,

279
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,840
except that it happened.

280
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,920
Right.

281
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,510
Are you...hating me?

282
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,560
No.

283
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:54,390
I didn't want you to find out later
from someone else and think there was

284
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,710
any more to it than there was,

285
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,790
because there wasn't,
there really wasn't.

286
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,870
It was one of those things you do
and after you go,

287
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:02,510
"God, why did I do that?!"

288
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,120
And the truth is...

289
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,400
..I was pissed.

290
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,230
I don't even fancy him.

291
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,640
I mean, you know, I don't mind him,
but...

292
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:20,790
Oh, I'm daring to hope that this
isn't going down too badly

293
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,790
judging by the expression
on your face.

294
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:26,590
I'm pleased you told me.
It won't happen again.

295
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,830
No, no...you can have him.
I don't want him.

296
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:31,070
He's got a good income.
I don't care.

297
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,590
Do you hate me? No.

298
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,030
Are you laughing at me or with me?

299
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:46,150
I don't know, I'm just...I'm...
I don't know, just laughing.

300
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:51,190
You're thinking, "Braindead,
low-life, trailer trash," aren't you?

301
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,030
Yeah.

302
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,960
But that's cos I'm a snotty bitch.

303
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,350
It's good that you're taking it
so well.

304
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:07,070
Maybe you're in shock. Maybe the
implications haven't sunk in yet.

305
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,910
Are there any?

306
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,630
You're not pregnant, are you?

307
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:14,600
No! That really would
thicken the plot.

308
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,760
So, um...

309
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,720
..when was this?

310
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:29,470
Night me dad and your mum drove
back over to Harrogate.

311
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:33,110
When he'd, you know, John had
spilled the beans to her about you.

312
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,320
Our birthday.

313
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,280
God. Right.

314
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:43,070
When I was propping
Judith up in casualty.

315
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,350
Were you?

316
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,720
Blimey.

317
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,960
"Are we cool, Vincent?"

318
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,830
Is that from something?

319
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:58,880
Pulp Fiction.

320
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:04,320
I'm Samuel L Jackson
and you're John Travolta.

321
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,680
Right.

322
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,750
Then we go out and shoot
some students, I think.

323
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,400
Unless I've misremembered.

324
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,200
Blimey.

325
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,710
I can't help thinking how
different things would've

326
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,190
been now if he hadn't
pulled through. Oh, Celia!

327
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:37,390
Well, you don't need to
think about that now, do you?

328
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,310
I think the world of you two.

329
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,360
You both know that, don't you?
Aww!

330
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,790
I'll get t'kettle on.

331
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:11,950
Where's little what's-his-name
with the broken leg?

332
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:16,990
Paul? I got shot of him.
I took him to his granny's.

333
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,840
Sit down, get warm.

334
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,750
I might get back off home, Mum.

335
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,790
Oh, I thought you were stopping.

336
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:30,590
I've left John at home with the
boys, which I'm not thrilled about.

337
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:33,710
I don't want him to think I need
him for anything, because I don't.

338
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:36,190
He rang earlier, John.
I don't know why.

339
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:40,310
Oh, to say you'd set off.
Seemed like an excuse.

340
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,590
He asked to speak to Gillian.
I don't know why.

341
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,390
I've been thinking.

342
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:49,110
How would you feel if,
when he comes out of hospital,

343
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:52,510
we came to live at my little flat?

344
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,990
I'd feel fine about it.
You see, the thing is,

345
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,270
you know my dad died of a heart
attack, climbing the stairs.

346
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,950
The doctor told him not to
and my mother, of course, said,

347
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:05,830
"Oh, you'll be all right,"
and that was it.

348
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,680
He'd not want to contradict her.

349
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,110
He went as white as a sheet.

350
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:16,550
Mum, it's your home.
It's absolutely fine by me.

351
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,470
What does Gillian think?

352
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,750
See, I've no stairs,
and it's nothing but stairs here,

353
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,790
and steep ones at that.

354
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,000
OK.

355
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:29,830
I've not broached him with it yet,
never mind Gillian.

356
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:33,910
He might have other ideas. OK.

357
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,240
Right.

358
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:38,750
Is everybody warm enough?

359
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:42,110
I'm going to...get, er...going.

360
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,350
OK.

361
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:47,950
I've a pile of paperwork to get
through and...

362
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,870
Ring me if you want anything.

363
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:53,120
I'll see you... I'll see you out...
Sure.

364
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,920
See you. See ya.

365
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,400
Are you all right? Yeah.

366
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:12,600
Is there something up between you
and Gillian?

367
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:19,800
She slept with John.

368
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:25,470
She just told me. That night,
my birthday, her birthday,

369
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:28,040
when he was over here
shooting his mouth off.

370
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:33,230
You and Alan set off over to
Harrogate, I was propping

371
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:38,110
Judith up in casualty and
they ended up in bed together.

372
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:40,310
I mean, she's told me
cos she feels bad about it

373
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:43,160
and she was drunk and she wishes it
hadn't happened, but...

374
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,550
I don't know.
How do people do that?

375
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:53,110
Why is everything so casual
and meaningless and...?

376
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,270
I can't leave.
I need to be near him.

377
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,030
No, I didn't...

378
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:01,190
I know that, I don't expect you to.

379
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,710
I was... Sorry, I just think I'm
a little bit shocked, that's all.

380
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,920
Don't say anything. No.

381
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:12,150
Do you think
before Judith, John was...?

382
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,480
At it with all and sundry?

383
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,160
Like your dad?

384
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,400
I don't know, love.

385
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,920
Ring me. Yes.

386
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,190
Don't say anything.

387
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,520
No, don't worry.

388
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,440
Everything all right? Hmm.

389
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:09,270
I thought I might turn in early,
if it's all right? Sure.

390
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:12,030
Course. You...
do what you need to do.

391
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,080
That for me? Yeah.

392
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,590
Is it all right if I...?

393
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,280
Course.

394
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,430
Night-night, love.

395
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,280
Night-night.

396
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,630
Ready, Mr Buttershaw?

397
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:13,030
I've been ready since six o'clock
this morning.

398
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:17,310
Have you heck?!
Not sat there, in your coat.

399
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:20,510
Still, wouldn't be the first time
you'd kept me waiting.

400
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:28,070
You're never going to let that drop,
are you? I might do one day,

401
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,920
if you play your cards right.

402
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:01,310
I resolved, the first time it
happened, that I was going to live

403
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:04,630
life differently and I did,
on the whole.

404
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:09,440
I got in touch with you,
didn't I, for instance? But now...

405
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:15,350
Now you're going to take things
steady. No. God, no.

406
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:18,630
Now I'm going to really
start living.

407
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,670
What do you think I'm doing
sat up here?

408
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:25,680
Well, you know what the consultant
just said. Oh, bugger that.

409
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:30,070
OK. So what've you got planned?

410
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:34,350
Anything. All sorts. Such as?

411
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:39,360
Have you ever fancied skiing?
No. Have you?

412
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,790
Oh, you!

413
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,190
Never! Good.

414
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,710
Well, that's that dealt with, then.

415
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,910
We used to come up here on bikes.

416
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:55,990
Me and Maurice and Harry
and Joe Riley.

417
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,750
You could get all t'way to Greetland
from top o' Barkisland

418
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,430
without pedalling once.

419
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:06,150
I know you could because... It were
like floating through the air.

420
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:09,190
Because me and Eileen and
Doreen Wilkinson

421
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:14,670
and our Muriel used to do just
the same. Did you? Yeah, yeah.

422
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:17,990
I always used to think you were
a bit smitten with Joe Riley.

423
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,670
Joe?!

424
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:23,550
No. Although he was very
good-looking.

425
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:27,550
I always thought he had
a look of Errol Flynn, but clever.

426
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,990
He went to work for NASA, didn't he?
He did!

427
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,670
He were made a Fellow of the
Royal Society, then off he went

428
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:40,030
to Altadena, California.
Brain drain. He were my best man...

429
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:44,510
when Eileen and I got wed.
Oh. Do you keep in touch?

430
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:51,150
We did. Every Christmas, and the
occasional letter in-between.

431
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,430
He popped over once or twice

432
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:55,990
to see his mother,
but we always caught up.

433
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,400
I always fancied popping over there,
but it never happened.

434
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,560
He had Parkinson's at finish.

435
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:11,110
We came up here to
scatter my dad's ashes,

436
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,710
me and me mum.

437
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:18,670
We drove over from Sheffield and
we had Caroline in the pushchair.

438
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,920
1969.

439
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:25,950
He loved up here, me dad.

440
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,870
It was a right farce.

441
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:30,070
We thought it would be like powder,

442
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,750
but it wasn't,
it was more like grit,

443
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:36,710
granules, and it got everywhere.

444
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:40,070
We just couldn't get rid of it. Him.

445
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:44,390
We hadn't thought it through.
Well, she hadn't, me mother.

446
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:49,990
And we hadn't got permission.
Well, we didn't know you needed it.

447
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,320
Perhaps you didn't then.
I don't know.

448
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,760
I don't know what my mum and dad
would've thought about me and you.

449
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:03,870
Actually, I do.
They'd have been over the moon.

450
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:06,120
They'd have been thrilled to
bits with you.

451
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,680
Do you fancy a pint?

452
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,270
It's only just gone half-past 11!

453
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:17,550
You've only been out of hospital
half an hour!

454
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:20,270
So what? You know damn well so what.

455
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:26,510
Do you fancy popping over to the
Registry Office first, then?

456
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:31,230
Are we serious,
about not telling anyone

457
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:35,520
till it's all over and done with?
Well, I am, yeah.

458
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:18,960
So that's a fortnight tomorrow
at 11am.

459
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,800
Shall I put that on a card for you?

460
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,870
Well, it's a good job you texted me

461
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:58,630
or I'd have been wondering
where you were.

462
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:03,110
Is it wise to go gallivanting when
you've only just been discharged?

463
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:07,710
I just wanted to see Ladstone Rock
and then we fancied a pint.

464
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:12,590
Oh, so you went via Aberdeen?
That's right.

465
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:15,710
Have you set a date? Sorry?
For the wedding?

466
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:19,230
Oh, no, love. No.

467
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:22,550
Alan needs to concentrate on
getting fit again first

468
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:25,110
before we start
thinking of anything like that.

469
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,830
Shall we get t'kettle on?

470
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:30,800
And then me and Celia have got
something to run past you.

471
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,270
Harrogate? I've no stairs.

472
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:41,990
And you're out on the farm all day,
or down at the shop,

473
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,470
whereas I can see to him 24/7.

474
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,920
That's what I'm thinking.

475
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:49,670
Well, that's very kind of you, but...

476
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,830
And it's not like it's for ever.

477
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:55,430
I mean, we do intend to buy.
Eventually.

478
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:58,030
OK. And soon.

479
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:01,510
And when we do, it'll more than
likely be round here.

480
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:03,430
Well, we've not discussed that yet.

481
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,790
No, no, but...

482
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:09,350
And it's not a million miles away,
Harrogate, is it?

483
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,630
No, it's not but...

484
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:15,390
And you'd be more than welcome,
any time you fancied, to pop over.

485
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:18,230
It is very nice, the house

486
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,950
and Celia's little flat.

487
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:22,800
I'm sure it is, Dad. I just...

488
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:28,550
So when were you thinking of...

489
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,070
Tomorrow.

490
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:34,630
Tomorrow? Does Caroline know...?

491
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,830
She's fine about it.

492
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,160
I see.

493
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:42,430
So...

494
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:45,560
Well, it just seems a bit sudden.

495
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,310
But... Well,

496
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,870
yeah, if it's what you want.

497
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:52,750
I thought it'd be
a weight off your mind.

498
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,350
You'll be 60 miles away.

499
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:57,870
Oh, no.
It's actually more like 40.

500
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,430
40, 60.

501
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,990
He'll be in good hands.

502
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,870
Yeah, I understand that, Celia.

503
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:08,390
You'll have to pretend
I'm on holiday.

504
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,670
Right.

505
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,230
But...

506
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,750
how about if I popped over with you?

507
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:19,030
Just quickly, just tomorrow,
just to make sure you're... Yeah.

508
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:21,270
..settled in all right
and everything's...

509
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:23,710
Sure.

510
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:28,040
Right. I'll get the kettle on.

511
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:38,990
I've got my new hat.
So that's that bit covered.

512
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,990
Something old, something new...

513
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,190
Something old we've not got.

514
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,190
Well, we're both old.

515
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:49,950
Are we? Well, you are, I'm not.

516
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:55,710
I started counting backwards
when I got to 36.

517
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:59,110
So how old does that make
you now then?

518
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,950
Minus three.

519
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,550
Fancy.

520
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:06,630
We had a very interesting
experience in 1988,

521
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:10,710
when me and our Caroline
were both 22.

522
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:13,670
That must have taken
some explaining.

523
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:15,550
Not really.

524
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:18,790
Something borrowed...

525
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:25,350
I could borrow a bow tie off
Maurice. Then I'd be very dapper.

526
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:28,030
You could and you would, but then
he'd want to know why you were

527
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:30,270
borrowing it. You know what
a nosy old bugger he is.

528
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:33,710
I could lie. I could say I'd been
invited to a cocktail party.

529
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:35,750
In Manhattan.

530
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,230
Mmm, he'd believe that.

531
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:39,830
Only he might want to come with me.

532
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:43,030
Tell him to sod off. OK.

533
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:45,190
Something blue.

534
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:48,110
A mucky magazine?

535
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:50,590
Have you got any?

536
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,870
No. Have you?

537
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:55,190
Oh, yeah, got loads(!)

538
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,440
No, I haven't.

539
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,400
She slept with John.

540
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:58,710
Who? Gillian.

541
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,830
That night when we drove over here,

542
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:04,030
and he'd been there shooting
his mouth off about Caroline

543
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,470
batting for the other side...

544
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:07,510
Slept with him?!

545
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,680
Had...sex with him.

546
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,230
How do you know?

547
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,150
Caroline told me.

548
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,590
Well, how does she know?

549
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:18,110
Gillian. Told her, apparently.

550
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:20,910
What for?

551
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:25,800
Well, because... I don't know.
I think because she regretted it.

552
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:32,160
I don't know why I've told you.
Well, except it's bothered me.

553
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:36,590
Sorry. I don't want to
burden you with it.

554
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:39,070
It's not... I'm not...

555
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:43,110
I'm just a bit befuddled with it
myself really.

556
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:48,190
And plus, I don't want to see her
get hurt. Gillian.

557
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:53,160
God! He's a bugger is John.

558
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:03,150
Gillian's coming! Gillian? Yes!

559
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:05,550
And Kate's here.

560
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:08,830
What's...? What's Gillian
coming here for?

561
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:12,590
Would you like some tea?
Ooh. Hi, John.

562
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,830
What's Gillian coming here for?

563
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:19,390
Alan's moving into my mum's to
recuperate and I think she wants to
see him settled in.

564
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:22,110
So, is...is she staying...long?

565
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:24,870
I don't know.
You'll have to ask her yourself.

566
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,270
Oh, and Kate's moving in.

567
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,110
I'll get my things out of the car.

568
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:32,870
Lawrence, can you help Kate
with her things?

569
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,710
That's... You can't expect me...

570
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:37,390
She's got her own house, what does
she want to move in here for?

571
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:40,470
John, after I came back here
on Saturday night

572
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:43,550
and found what I found, I'm amazed
you could begin to imagine that

573
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:46,310
you have anything to say at all
about what other people do.

574
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,470
Judith... Judith needs help.

575
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:51,350
Judith and I are not an item.
Well, you could've fooled me!

576
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:56,030
I will not be made to feel like a
sodding gooseberry in my own house.

577
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:59,040
That-that-that was...
You have nothing to say.

578
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,880
What time are they getting here?

579
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,790
Blimey.

580
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:26,600
My little apartment's
round the back, Gillian.

581
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:31,160
Done all right for yourself here,
Dad, eh?

582
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:34,590
What's up?

583
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:38,750
I thought we were plumbing depths
with Susan Jatri's lad, but John?

584
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:41,470
He's practically
your brother-in-law.

585
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:44,270
And I thought you told me you and
Robbie were more or less an item?

586
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,510
How did...? Who...?

587
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:48,190
Celia told me. Caroline told her.

588
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:51,710
You... I told Caroline
because I felt bad about it.

589
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:56,470
I was pissed, it was my birthday.
Me and Robbie are...

590
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,910
Are we going in? Yeah, let me.

591
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,920
I'll lead the way.

592
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:06,350
It didn't mean anything.
It was rubbish, it was ridiculous.

593
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:08,440
I just felt sorry for him.

594
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,550
You're a...

595
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,960
What am I? Come on!
Don't hold back!

596
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:18,070
..a pillock!

597
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:22,310
Oh, OK. I thought you were going
to say something worse. I was.

598
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,600
Yeah! Whatever.

599
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:28,070
I've put my things in your bedroom.

600
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:31,070
Is that...? Of course it is.

601
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:32,480
How permanent is this?

602
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:37,510
We need to sit down and have
the conversation properly,

603
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:42,710
and not when we've been rushed
into it, but it's... Yeah. If...

604
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:48,670
If... Yeah. If it's what you want.

605
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:50,120
Do you need to ask?

606
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:58,750
Hello?
'We're back, we've arrived.'

607
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:02,190
Good! They've arrived.
I'll pop round.

608
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,230
There's something
I need to tell you.

609
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,630
'Right. Ta-ta.'

610
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:08,200
She's popping round.

611
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,920
What's up?

612
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:17,390
It's just a disappointment,
isn't it?

613
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:19,230
An ongoing disappointment.

614
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:23,470
And for the record, he is not
my brother-in-law because, A,

615
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:28,830
you're not married yet, and two - him
and Caroline are getting divorced.

616
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:32,710
Ipso-facto, QED,
NOT my brother-in-law.

617
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,790
I said not to say anything.

618
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,350
Aye. Well, I did.

619
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:40,790
Can we all just get it into our
little heads that I regret it

620
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:44,270
and it won't happen again?
Would you like that written down?

621
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:46,030
In triplicate?

622
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:49,240
What for? It wouldn't mean owt.

623
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:53,750
Dad, I'm going to get upset.

624
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,870
Well, what do you expect?

625
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:58,600
She were pregnant when she were 15.

626
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:05,750
Dad! Broke Eileen's heart.
Perhaps you didn't know that.

627
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:11,950
Hi! Alan!

628
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:14,920
Hello, love.
How was your journey?

629
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:23,560
It was fine.
Good! Is everything...?

630
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:27,390
I'll put the kettle on in a minute.
I'm cooking for everyone.

631
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,470
It'll be about half an hour
if that's...

632
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:31,480
Perfect, love.
Smashing.

633
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:38,110
So, I just need to...tell you
something.

634
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:41,550
Kate's here. You're going to have to
bear with me. I didn't plan this

635
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:45,190
exactly to coincide...
Only, when I got back here

636
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,840
on Saturday night, Judith was here.

637
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:57,390
Ahh!

638
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:59,390
Oh!

639
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:03,070
Oh, Jesus!

640
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:10,230
Shit! I thought... He said you were
in... Where is it? Huddersfield.

641
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:13,830
Halifax.

642
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:16,350
What's the matter? What's happened?

643
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:19,870
You've not fallen down the stairs
again have you, you silly cow?

644
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:23,710
Caroline's here. What?
Caroline's here! What?

645
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:25,910
CAROLINE'S...
Caroline's in Halifax.

646
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,790
Where are the boys?

647
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:31,030
They're around. What are you doing
here? You're supposed to be...

648
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:33,910
They've been playing music really
loud and making loads of noise,

649
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:38,190
and they were throwing stuff around
in the kitchen and then they went
upstairs in your bedroom!

650
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:42,790
That kid needs to lighten up.
We thought you were going to be away
all night.

651
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:45,830
Oh, God, don't snivel!
It's hardly that...bad.

652
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:47,830
Get your coats on, get into my car.

653
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:50,750
I'll be back in the morning
and I don't care how you do it,

654
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:52,910
but that kitchen better
be as spotless as it was

655
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:55,550
when I left here this afternoon.

656
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:57,670
Oi, you have friends round,

657
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:59,750
I have friends round.

658
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:01,910
You've traumatised our children.

659
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:05,350
I have? What about you?
You've scarred them for life!

660
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:08,670
Do you know what? I'm actually
starting to feel a bit queasy.

661
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:11,630
This is nothing compared to what
you're actively

662
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:14,030
inflicting on them,
you mad old dyke!

663
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:17,390
And bollocks to you with your
"this kitchen better be spotless".

664
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:20,870
I don't know why I'm bothering to
remind you, but I will.

665
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:25,470
This house... This house was paid
for almost entirely with money

666
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:28,110
I earned when I was
on the bestseller list! So f...

667
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:35,310
I'll see you in the morning. Yeah.

668
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:37,470
Whatever.

669
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:41,470
So, I took the boys round
to Kate's for the night

670
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:45,590
and, um...John was pretty appalled,
to be fair to him,

671
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:47,270
on Sunday morning.

672
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:49,030
He had tried to tidy the kitchen up,

673
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:51,790
but he wasn't really in any
fit state to stand up

674
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:55,630
for any length of time
until the early evening,
so I had to help him.

675
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:59,310
Then I asked him
if he would move out,

676
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:01,390
so that we can all move on
with our lives,

677
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:03,750
but he's still refusing to do that.

678
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:05,750
So I have asked Kate to move in

679
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:09,390
in the hope that, at some point,
he will get the message.

680
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:13,320
So that's why Kate's here, OK?

681
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:25,360
Where's Caroline? Next door.

682
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:30,990
Is...Gillian staying for supper?

683
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,240
I don't know.

684
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:36,990
What are you...cooking?

685
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:41,470
It's... Erm...I don't know.
Caroline's in charge, I'm just...

686
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:43,790
What's she doing next door? I...

687
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:48,080
God, I can't stand this!
This is my house, I live here.

688
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:53,270
Is she...? She'd better not be.
What?

689
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:56,430
Telling people things about me.

690
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:59,070
I'm not going to be made to
feel like...

691
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:02,270
whatever in my own house.

692
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:05,680
I...have no opinion on that.

693
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:13,550
He's a mess is John.

694
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:16,480
As long as nobody's under
any illusions.

695
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:22,110
Caroline, I'm going to get off home.

696
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:23,160
OK.

697
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,910
Ring me if you want anything.

698
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:30,550
Right.

699
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:33,240
Right. Thanks, Celia.

700
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:35,800
OK, love.

701
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:44,600
I'll...

702
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:55,680
Gillian?
Sorry, I need to get home.

703
00:45:57,360 --> 00:46:02,350
What's the matter? Nothing.
Come inside. No. No, I'll...

704
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:04,750
Well... What's happened?

705
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:07,510
It's fine. It's fine.
I'm just leaving him here,

706
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:10,110
60, 40 miles from home and...

707
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:13,190
She'll look after him.
I know that.

708
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:16,990
And I'll keep an eye on everything.
I know. I know you will.

709
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,910
You can come here any time you like.
I know. I know.

710
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:22,680
Why did you tell your mum?

711
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:27,390
Is that what's...?

712
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:31,880
She's told me dad and he's...
Did she? I'm sorry, I just...

713
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:38,990
I just couldn't... Just couldn't...

714
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:43,350
No, don't. It's all my own stupid
fault anyway, isn't it?

715
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:45,280
Is he upset?

716
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:49,270
Oh, God. I'm sorry.

717
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:50,320
No, it's...

718
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:56,430
He said something about me mum.

719
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:57,480
That's all.

720
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:01,200
I broke her heart apparently.

721
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:03,920
When I was 15.

722
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:08,590
Well, I did. I know I did.

723
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:09,790
I got pregnant.

724
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:13,950
I had to leave school at the time.
You know, I went back...

725
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:17,440
later to do my A-levels,
but...it never worked out, so...

726
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:23,150
All very disappointing for them.

727
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:25,880
So, yup, that's me.

728
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:28,190
You had a baby?

729
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:31,240
No! No. A-Abortion.

730
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:36,630
Sorry. I am sorry. I don't know why
I told her, I just...

731
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:40,550
had it on my brain and, you know,
she's me mum, and...

732
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:43,150
Well, it'll blow over.
Yeah. Will it?

733
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:46,680
Just bad timing. With his...
Yeah. Sorry.

734
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:50,710
I'll get off. I'll ring you.

735
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:53,430
I wasn't accusing you. I just...
I'm sorry.

736
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:55,600
Not your fault. Really not.

737
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:04,240
Why am I apologising?

738
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:10,360
Sanctimonious b...

739
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:41,070
Gillian! Shit!

740
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:42,470
I need to talk to you.

741
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:44,950
Yeah, well, I don't need to
talk to you!

742
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:49,310
In fact, right now...
I can't.....you're the last...

743
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:51,670
You can't treat people like this.

744
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:55,350
You can't ignore my texts and
hang up on me on the phone.

745
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:58,830
Can you get out of my Land Rover,
please? We had sex.

746
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:01,910
Yes, we did.
And, boy, am I paying for it now?!

747
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:04,790
You came onto me. Not! So
forgive me... Yes, you did. You...

748
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:07,990
I tentatively explained that
I had feelings for you.

749
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,830
You said, "Shall we go upstairs?"
So forgive me for thinking that

750
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:13,670
we'd embarked upon some sort of
relationship. OK. Right. Right.

751
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:16,430
So, please, can you explain why,
Saturday afternoon,

752
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:17,950
you're on the phone saying,

753
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:21,670
"I think I might be a little bit in
love with you, Gillian," and then,

754
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:25,830
the same night, you're here,
in bed with Judith apparently,

755
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:28,070
who you claim to hate.

756
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:31,350
She told you. Caroline. She...
Yes! Well, isn't it obvious?

757
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:33,830
Not to me!
I'm floundering.

758
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:37,270
What? You won't speak to me,
she's decided she's a dyke,

759
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:38,670
the boys think I'm ridiculous.

760
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:41,990
Oh, no. They don't. Do they?

761
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,230
I've got nothing. She's moved her
insipid little girlfriend in

762
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:47,830
and her mad mother...
Oi, steady on.

763
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:53,430
I bought that house and now I'm
the one who... Oh, shit!

764
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:55,310
I'm going to have to knock
to get back in.

765
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:57,710
Aw-w! Bless.

766
00:49:57,720 --> 00:50:00,110
Yeah, it's all so funny, isn't it?

767
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:01,630
Sorry.

768
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:05,230
I'm all over the place, I can't
think straight, and then... God!

769
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:09,550
I end up in another tawdry mess
with that ridiculous woman
in front of the children.

770
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:13,350
You know, people commit suicide
with less than this eating away
inside their brain.

771
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:15,870
Is it...that bad?

772
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:17,520
My publisher's dropped me.

773
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,520
Why?

774
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:26,880
It's being brewing for a while.
I got an e-mail last week.

775
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:34,070
Well...is there someone you can
talk to about it?

776
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:36,990
No, not really. It's not something
you want to tell to just anyone.

777
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:40,070
And my agent...he's not
returned my calls, so that's...

778
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:42,630
You see, before,
Caroline would've been really...

779
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:44,310
good about something like that.

780
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:46,510
She'd have put it in a context.

781
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:49,110
She'd have thrown a light
on it that...

782
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:52,030
She can be a really good person
to have in your corner.

783
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:55,360
Yeah, well, shame you were
unfaithful to her.

784
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:57,910
Sorry.

785
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:00,280
Everything's just such a mess.

786
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:05,920
What did you mean when you said,
"And, boy, am I paying for it now"?

787
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:10,070
Well... OK. They all know.

788
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:13,080
That we... Do they?

789
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:20,190
Do they? Well, is that...

790
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:23,910
such a bad thing?
Couldn't we...?

791
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:29,270
No. It was a mistake,
it should never have happened.

792
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:31,870
I have to go, John.

793
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:34,150
I'm sorry about your publisher

794
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:37,470
but, you know, we've all
got crosses to bear.

795
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:40,110
I don't know how much longer
I can afford to keep the farm going,

796
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:42,590
way things are at the moment. Why?

797
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:45,190
Oh...money. Really?

798
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:46,320
That's my problem.

799
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:50,590
So...what if I...popped over

800
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:52,750
some time? Would that be...

801
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:54,910
completely...?

802
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:56,990
I'm seeing Robbie.

803
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,630
I thought you hated Robbie.

804
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:00,560
Yeah, I thought you hated Judith.

805
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:31,320
What are you doing outside?
I... Does it matter?

806
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:39,550
Do you want something to eat?

807
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:42,680
Is there enough?
You'll have to find a chair.

808
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:01,390
Hello.

809
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:03,390
Hi, Alan. How's...? Are you...?

810
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:06,350
Oh, fighting fit.

811
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:09,270
Good. That's good. That's...

812
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:11,630
Would you like...?

813
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:13,440
Well, perhaps just a small one.

814
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:18,640
I'll get you a glass.

815
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:37,520
Come by!

816
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:40,600
Away! Away!

817
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:56,040
Can you sit down, please?

818
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:00,470
On you go. Come on.

819
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:16,200
In you go.

820
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:45,760
Oh, sorry.

821
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:48,560
Oh, I've got to take this.

822
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,910
Hello, Gillian.
'You busy?'

823
00:54:56,920 --> 00:54:58,790
I'm in a meeting.

824
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:01,470
All right. Well, I'm sorry,
but this might be urgent.

825
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:03,310
Why?

826
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:04,710
Where's me dad and Celia?

827
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:08,190
Well, erm...at home
as far as I know.

828
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:10,520
They... So, you've...

829
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:14,310
So no-one's been...

830
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:18,990
I've found a card,
behind a cushion,

831
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:24,190
'on our settee. It's from
Calderdale Registry Office.

832
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:26,670
'An appointment card.
They've got an appointment'

833
00:55:26,680 --> 00:55:30,230
to get married at...11 o'clock
this morning.

834
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:31,510
You're kidding!

835
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:33,590
Have they...?

836
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:35,550
Have they not said anything to you?

837
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:36,990
'No.'

838
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,550
Er...no.

839
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:42,350
I've tried his mobile,
I've tried hers.

840
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:44,150
I can be there if you can.

841
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:48,310
I'll probably overtake them
on the M62. The little buggers!

842
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:52,470
But...presumably, they don't
want us there

843
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:55,950
and, presumably, that's the point.

844
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:58,240
'Has he not said
anything to you at all?'

845
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:02,950
I've spoken to him twice
on the phone...

846
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:06,630
'in the last two weeks
since he came to live at yours,

847
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:08,230
'all of it very perfunctory.'

848
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:12,550
Not exactly flavour of the month
at the moment, am I?

849
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:13,960
'What, still?'

850
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:18,270
'It's just a bit much, isn't it?'

851
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:21,710
Our parents are getting married and
they don't even want us there.

852
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:24,150
Perhaps they don't want a fuss.

853
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:28,950
Gillian, I'm going to have to go.
I'm chairing a meeting.

854
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:31,350
Right. Sorry, is that all right?
Can I ring you...?

855
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:32,760
(Bi...)

856
00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:10,630
Shall we get married
and not tell anyone?

857
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:13,870
'You doing anything this weekend?'
What did you have in mind? All sorts.

858
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:17,790
I want a baby.

859
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:19,550
No.

860
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:22,230
No, Caroline, I'm serious.

861
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:24,430
Just keep pushing, love!
keep pushing.

862
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:27,550
Keep squeezing Grandad's hand.
He's not me grandad!

863
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:30,990
We'd have never carried on like that
at that age, would we?

864
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,790
Don't go, Dad.

865
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:37,470
I don't know how you could fashion
talking to your dad like this,

866
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:40,150
when you know how poorly he's been.

867
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:41,640
Pow.
