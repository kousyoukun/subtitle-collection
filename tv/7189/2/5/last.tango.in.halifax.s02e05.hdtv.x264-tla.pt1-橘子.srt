1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:03,050
所以那个婊子就是你 对不对
So you're her, are you? You're the whore.

2
00:00:03,051 --> 00:00:04,870
艾米丽・珍・格林伍德-华莱士
"Emily Jane Greenwood-Wallace".

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:08,950
对于一个只有六磅三盎司的小家伙来说 这名字还真长
Well that's a gob-full, for someone who only weighs 6lbs 3oz.

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,350
你不能给孩子起这名字
You can't call a baby that!

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,510
他们叫她什么了
What've they called it?

6
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:14,190
克莱莫提・珍 <font color="#4096d1">(灾难)</font>
Calamity Jane.

7
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,990
你告诉我你订了这个地方时我都高兴死了
I was so delighted when you told me you'd booked this place.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,270
然后你就订了两个房间
And then you go and book two separate rooms.

9
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:22,430
上次我说只是去看看的那小屋
That bungalow we went to see when I said we were just looking...

10
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,350
我们付了定金
We've put in an offer.

11
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:25,560
莫里斯死了
Maurice is dead.

12

格雷格      凯特
Greg!        Kate!

13
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,110
你俩上床了?      没有
Have you slept together?        No!

14
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,270
你要甩了我?
Are you dumping me?

15
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,960
我想我们就没真正开始过 是吗
I don't think anything ever really started, did it?

16
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,310
你愿意再次嫁给我吗
Will you marry me? Again?

17
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,360
那么来吧
Go on, then.

18
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,270
太好了      太好了
Yeah!        Yes!

19
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:00,150
你确定这些你都需要么      是的
Are you absolutely sure you need all this stuff?        Yes.

20
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:04,830
学期结束的时候你还会再运回来的      所以呢
You'll only have it all to cart back again at the end of term.        And?

21
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,910
差不多了吗
Are you nearly ready?

22
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,470
对 楼上还有最后一个包
Yeah! I've just got one more bag upstairs.

23

去和外婆说一声威廉要走了
Nip round and tell Granny William's going.

24
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,230
你有没有寄离婚协议书
Have you had the divorce papers in the post?

25
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,470
寄了      签名了没
Yes.        Have you signed them?

26
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,030
签了
Yes.

27
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,150
你是用挂号信寄的吗
Did you send them back by registered post?

28
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,550
我已经寄了
I sent them back.

29
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,710
是用挂号信记的吗
By registered post?

30
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,430
上面写明了要用挂号信寄的
It said specifically to return them by registered post.

31
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,131
我擦
Oh for f...! 

32
00:02:25,132 --> 00:02:29,670
我上网申请已经给你省了几千英镑的律师费了
I have saved you thousands of pounds in lawyers' fees by organising this online.

33
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,110

34
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,240
拿到了
Got it!

35
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,040
他们要走了      喂 艾伦 他们要走了
They're going!        Ey up, Alan! They're going!

36
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,390
到了打个电话
Ring me when you get there.

37
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,950
你想打而且不忙的话就打 不然就发短信
Only if you want to, only if you're not busy. Or drop me a text.

38
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,110
我会给你打电话      我真希望我可以和你一起去
I'll ring you. I wish I could come with you.

好极了 他终于滚了
WAY-HEY! Finally, we get rid of him!

43
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:13,110
怎么会有他的存在@@不务正业@@是啊 是特殊需求啊
Why does he exist? @@ Beano boy. @@ Yeah, special needs.

44
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,350

48
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,990
不用 一脚油门踩下去 两个半小时就到
Nah! Foot down, two-and-a-half.

49

53
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,750
啊 给 勤洗衣服
Aww! Here, get your washing done regularly.

54
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,590
女孩子喜欢穿干净内裤的男孩子 其他的说辞都是假的
Girls like boys with clean underwear, don't let anyone tell you different.

55
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,470
你也会给我钱吗 外婆
Do I get a twencer, Gran?

56
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,600
可以啊 等你上了牛津以后

再见      再见
Bye!        Bye!

58

I need a poo.

59
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,280
喔 鸡蛋应该煮熟了
Ooh! That egg'll be boiling.

60
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,920
你没事吧 亲爱的
You all right, love?

61
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,870
嗯
Yeah.

62
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,670
只是 嗯
I was, um...

Big day.

64
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,910
我和艾伦今天会去里彭登
Me and Alan are off over to Ripponden today.

65
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:33,030
我们会去帮忙照顾孩子
We said we'd help out with the baby.

66
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,990
还是来来回回跑啊
Still back and forth.

67
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,470
真可惜 小屋的计划泡汤了
It's a shame that bungalow fell through.

68
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,750
你们婚礼计划得怎样了
How're the wedding plans going?

69
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:42,270
哦 还在原地踏步呢
Oh, we never seem to get any closer.

70
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,870
为什么
Why?

71
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:48,910
呃 原因之一 他去邀请了他的哥哥泰德
Well, for one reason, he's gone and invited Ted. His brother.

72
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,390
我不知道艾伦还有哥哥
I didn't know Alan had a brother.

73
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,950
有 叫泰德 比我们大两岁
Yeah. Ted. He was two years above us.

74
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,710
好吧
Right.

75
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,670
泰德来有什么不妥吗
So, what's wrong with Ted coming?

76
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,030
他在新西兰
He's in New Zealand.

77
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:01,150
他有五个已婚的孩子
He's got five kids and they're all married

78
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:06,390
他们生了十三个孙子孙女 天知道为什么
and they've got 13 grandchildren between them, and, God knows why, but,

79
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:11,350
因为他们都没见过艾伦 所以都想来
because they've never met Alan, they all want to come over.

80
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,640
哦 天啊 所以呢?
Oh, gosh. So...?

81
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:16,790
我们一开始真没计划租那么大的会场
Well, we weren't planning on having that big a venue, really.

82
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,470
但现在婚礼就成了一场后勤恶梦
But now it's all become a logistical nightmare.

83
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,070
怎么会
How?

84
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,350
就是这样
Oh, well, it has.

85
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,470
怎么会
How?

86
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,400
其中一个只吃素
One of them's a vegetarian.

87
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:32,590
这不是什么无法克服的障碍对吧
Well, that's not insurmountable, is it, as problems go?

88
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,230
就只是... "他们要住在哪里"
Oh, it's all... "where are they staying?"

89
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:38,430
天知道 还有"他们会坐同一个班机来吗"
and God knows what, and "will they all get a flight at the same time?"

90
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,910
好吧
Right.

91
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:43,710
你看 所以我们原本才打算悄悄结婚的
You see, this is why we just wanted to do it all on the quiet.

92
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:47,200
一开始是啊 后来你们决定邀请客人了
Well, you did. And then you decided to do this.

93
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,520
你后来又被调查过没有?
Have y'had any more inquiries?

94
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,800
这周没有
No, not this week.

95
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,950
她好了 你能抱抱她吗 我还没刷牙呢
She's done, can you take her? I've not brushed my teeth.

96
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,470
我在给你做三明治呢
I'm making you a sandwich.

97
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,800
但是需要有人给她拍背
Yeah, but she needs to get her wind up.

98
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,630
啊 你没给她换尿布吗
Ugh! Have you not done her nappy?

99
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,750
换了 她不会是...
Yeah. She hasn't...?

100
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:35,790
好像是的
I think she has.

101
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,630
那壶里还有茶吗
Is there any tea left in that pot?

102
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:40,390
抖抖的话说不定还能抖出些来
Yeah, probably, if you squeeze it!

103
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,510
妈妈 能抱一下克莱莫提吗 她需要打嗝
Mum, can you take Calamity? She needs burping.

104
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,960
你要迟到了@@我知道
You're going to be late. @@ Yeah, I do know!

105
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,950

You don't want to be missing the bus, not this morning.

106
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,910
我没法送你去 我要把猪送去家畜集...
I can't drive you, I'm taking hogs to t'livestock mar...

107
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,670

Has she...?

Then, ideally, if it's possible, if it's something you can accommodate,

139
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,150
我想回来当兼职
I'd like to come back part-time.

How possible is that?

143
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,990
我知道你过去对于去组建自己家庭
I know you've always been very good in the past

144
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,040

with women who've left to start families and then wanted to go part-time.

145
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,110
你得让我考虑一下
You'll have to leave it with me.

146

如果你想的是"想得美" 请你直说
If what you're really thinking is, "You'll be lucky", I'd rather you just said.

147
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,840
别这么不信任我
I hope you know me better than that.

00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,960
我只是需要时间去安排后勤的事 仅此而已
I just need time to work out the logistics, that's all.

Make yourself a cup o' tea if you want to. I've got to get to Otley.

172

It's her sister.

西莉亚有妹妹?
Has Celia got a sister?

181
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:59,430
穆里尔 在小学的时候她比我们低一年级

Upshot is, she can't decide whether she wants her at t'wedding or not.

209

It were after Maurice died. You have to seize the day.

210
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,030
It's something I've always fancied, as far back as ever I can remember.

211
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,430
How do you go on opening locks on your own?

212
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:50,190
Piece of piss, what you on about? Hey, ladies present.

213

Oh, I've heard worse. I meant baby.

He means when you get even older, you dozy old sod.

215
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:59,990
How're you going to open locks when you're juggling with a Zimmer frame?

216
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,160
Nay, I'll shoot me sen before I get to that stage!

217
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:08,910
He'll sell his house, live on it for two or three weeks and then he'll get fed up.

218
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:11,590
He misses Maurice. Aw.

219
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,190
Is it just three of us for supper? Yeah.

220
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,590
Where have Raff and Ellie taken Calamity, then? Oh, just...

221

So - he works with her. She's a copper.

223
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:32,830
She's blonde, gorgeous, 15 years younger than him, divorced.

224
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:35,800
Is he making a point? Yeah.

225
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:40,110
Of course he is. He's always hated her up to now.

226
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:43,590
Gone on about how annoying and dippy she is. So, yeah.

227
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:49,990
Men, transparent. What can you do? Present company excepted, obviously.

228
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:56,190
Except Raff says she's moving in with him. Apparently.

229
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,720
John's back with Judith.

230
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,150
I'm really not interested in John, Celia.

231

Thanks. Really, really not.

232

Oh, no, I was just saying.

233

I mean, God knows why.

234
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,070
I honestly don't think they can stand each other.

235
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,430
It's just a habit. A bad habit.

236
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,350
How's Caroline?

237
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,990
She's all right.

238
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,630
Oh, yeah!

239
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:24,270
Celia...tell me about your sister!

240
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,310
I didn't know you had a sister.

241
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:32,310
Shame the wedding plans have got bogged down cos of her.

242
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:36,550
Oh, it's not cos of our Muriel, it's cos of Ted, isn't it?

243
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:40,070
About them not being able to make their minds up when they're coming over

244
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:42,030
and where they're all going to stay, and...

245
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,550
No. No, I don't think so.

246
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:47,240
Ted's waiting for you to fix a date so they can all book their flights.

247
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,310
Well, I got the impression...

248
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:54,070
No, no, there's no problem there. Is there? Dad?

249
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:58,470
Er...well, it'll be tricky for 'em co-ordinating everything,

250
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,870
but, erm...no.

251
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:03,950
No, I don't think the problem is wi' our Ted, really.

252
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,590
Anyway, that's their problem.

253
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,150
You set a date, they turn up, if they can.

254
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,430
I don't think they expect you to organise it around them.

255
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,070
They don't. They absolutely don't.

256
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,440
They're not like that.

257
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,150
Have you heard from Will?

258
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,000
Yeah, he's fine. I got a text.

259
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,320
Can I go and live with my dad?

260
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,800
Why do you want to do that?

261
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:01,560
He's not...boring.

262
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:04,910
Sorry.

263
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:07,000
I really don't think that's a good idea.

264
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,160
I'm sorry if you think I'm...

265
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:16,470
..not very exciting, but I've seen Judith's flat.

266
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,870
You wouldn't want to live there,

267
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:20,270
you wouldn't want to spend more than five minutes there.

268
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,990
Hello? Caroline? It's Gillian.

269
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,910
'Oh, hello.'

270
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,150
How are you?

271
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,990
Fine! Fine.

272
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,590
Good.

273
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,990
'Are you?' Yeah! Yeah.

274
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,670
I was ringing you...about the wedding.

275
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,310
I'm just concerned.

276
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:52,070
I thought you might be able to throw a bit of light on something. OK.

277
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,790
It all seems to have got bogged down, somehow.

278
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,470
And...I think it's making me dad a bit miserable.

279
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:03,070
Oh! I know. is it not to do with...um...uh, Ted, his brother?

280
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:05,270
No. No, it isn't.

281
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,600
'That's what my mum said.'

282
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:11,630
She's using that as an excuse. I did wonder.

283
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,830
I think it's to do with her sister. Muriel?

284
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:17,950
Right. Right.

285
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,510
Ted's fine, honestly.

286
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,710
He's really easygoing, he just wants to fit in.

287
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,310
Yeah - it's...

288
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,670
That wouldn't surprise me, Muriel.

289
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,430
Is she...difficult?

290
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,110
Auntie Muriel? No! God, no. She's...

291
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:34,230
They're just chalk and cheese, that's all. 'OK.'

292
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,110
Only if we could get to t'bottom of whether she's coming or not,

293
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,950
they could move forward with things, that's all.

294
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,270
Oh, she'll be coming. I don't think she wouldn't come.

295
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:45,830
Well, pinning it down, then, so they can set a date.

296
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:50,150
Could you ring her? Muriel? Yeah, sure.

297
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,470
Find out what stage they're at in their delicate negotiations,

298
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:56,030
cos I've got Ted and his lot Skyping every five minutes

299
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:58,190
'wanting to know when they can book their flights.

300
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,550
'Sooner they can book, cheaper it'll be.'

301
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,670
Course. Of course. OK. Leave it with me.

302
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:05,110
It's just...they're just...it's...

303
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,110
Complicated.

304
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:10,240
Yeah. Yeah.

305
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,190
Oh, hell! Orange again.

306
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,230
I hate sport and nature.

307
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,870
No, it's sport and leisure.

308
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,230
No, that's green.

309
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,350
No, that's science and nature.

310
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:25,360
Is it? Yeah. Oh, OK.

311
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:29,230
Sherlock Holmes. The Beatles. Shakespeare.

312
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,310
Sorry? The answer.

313
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,310
But I haven't asked t'question yet.

314
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:35,230
No, I know, but it will be one of them.

315
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,670
It always is, the answer.

316
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,960
Or Manchester United.

317
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,950
I've been thinking. Oh, aye? What with?

318
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:46,682
Oh, you're so funny Why don't I...

319
00:19:46,683 --> 00:19:50,200
Why don't me and Caroline organise the wedding?

320
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,310
Really? Yeah.

321
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:55,070
Only you seem to have got stuck

322
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,550
and I can't believe you WANT to be stuck. So...

323
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,990
Well, I...

324
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,870
We'd run everything past you. We wouldn't do anything you'd hate.

325
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:04,990
Have you spoken to her? Just now, just this second.

326
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,310
Oh. Well...

327
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,510
Why don't we just check out some venues for you, at least?

328
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,470
We'll suss a few out and then you choose.

329
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:14,902
And we'll compile an invite list and then you can...

330
00:20:14,903 --> 00:20:17,640
cross anyone out that you don't really want.

331
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,910
Well...I don't know.

332
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:25,230
I suppose so, if you wanted to.

333
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,910
We would love to. I would love to.

334
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,350
Oh, who's this?

335
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,680
Muriel!

336
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,270
Hello!

337
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,080
Hello? I've just put my foot right in it!

338
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,510
Have you? Why?

339
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,590
She didn't know - Muriel didn't even know.

340
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,070
My mother hadn't even told her!

341
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,590
Wow. Wow. That's...

342
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,630
Alan Buttershaw!

343
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,470
That's...it's so perfect! It's wonderful.

344
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,550
Gosh, you must be so happy.

345
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:58,470
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I am.

346
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,190
So when is it? The wedding?

347
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,030
Well, we've - we've...

348
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:04,990
Um...how did you know?

349
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,310
Caroline. Caroline just rang, just now.

350
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:10,270
I am so deep in the doghouse, it won't ever be worth trying to get out.

351
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,350
It's not your fault. Our Caroline?

352
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:15,670
You don't know what it's like. Caroline, you didn't know.

353
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,430
Oh, damn! She's spoilt the surprise!

354
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:21,550
I was thinking of popping down this...this very weekend,

355
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:24,550
this coming weekend, to tell you.

356
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,950
Both of us, me and Alan.

357
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,000
How's she taking it?

358
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,920
She's smiling, she's happy.

359
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:35,680
She's laughing! Yeah, well that's just...

360
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,470
You wait till she comes off the phone.

361
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,710
It'll be Armageddon.

362
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,430
The forces of Gog and Magog

363
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,630
will gather from the four corners of the earth...

364
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,350
You're losing me, Caroline. Yeah, well, good luck.

365
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,350
I've offered to organise the wedding for them.

366
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,760
And I said you'd help me.

367
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,830
Hello? 'Go on!

368
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,550
'Come on, we'll have a laugh.'

369
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,670
I could use a laugh, couldn't you?

370
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,160
I'm...

371
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,520
..bloody well fed-up.

372
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,550
'I have been for months.'

373
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,120
Yeah. Yeah...

374
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,310
Yeah, all right.

375
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:20,110
Oh, wonderful! That'd be lovely.

376
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:22,190
So this coming weekend?

377
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,830
How are you fixed this coming weekend?

378
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,670
Yes, well, if that was the plan, if that fits in with you and Alan,

379
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,230
it's absolutely fine with me.

380
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,710
You'll be thinking I wasn't going to tell you.

381
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,030
'No! No.'

382
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:34,350
And nothing could be further from the truth.

383
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,950
No, you wanted to surprise me - that's nice!

384
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,190
Yeah...

385
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,550
Well, give Alan my love.

386
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,870
I will.

387
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,870
Oh, Caroline was telling me her and John are getting divorced.

388
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:46,590
Oh - what else did she tell you?

389
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,070
Nothing, she didn't have time.

390
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,710
I wanted to ring you to say congratulations.

391
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,470
You'll have to fill me in when I see you.

392
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,630
Yeah.

393
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,310
OK, then. Aw! Bye-bye.

394
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,400
Bye, bye. Bye-bye!

395
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,160
Who were that?

396
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,840
Muriel - our Muriel.

397
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,160
Nice. Yeah.

398
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,280
Whose roll is it?

399
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:24,950
I don't know what Caroline was thinking of, ringing our Muriel.

400
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,670
Well, she'd have assumed - and she wasn't alone -

401
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:31,070
that you'd spoken to Muriel any number of weeks ago.

402
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,830
Well, I never said I had.

403
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:36,510
If you don't want her there, we won't invite her.

404
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:38,590
What're you smiling at? You.

405
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:41,510
Whenever have I said I didn't want her there?

406
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,910
It's an impression you've given.

407
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,200
I don't know how.

408
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:49,110
She's always to be interfering. Who?

409
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:52,550
Caroline - always has to be organising everybody.

410
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:55,950
Of course I want my sister at my wedding!

411
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:58,990
Good! Good.

412
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,670
I don't know why you've got that expression on your face.

413
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,440
She's all right, our Muriel.

414
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,520
In small doses.

415
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:15,310
And if Gillian told you to jump off a cliff, what would your response to that be?

416
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,892
Mum, I've explained what happened. 

417
00:24:16,893 --> 00:24:20,550
I won't go through it again, because you are choosing not to hear what's being said.

418
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:23,710
What YOU have to decide - when you're calmer -

419
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,990
is whether you want Muriel there on the day or not,

420
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,150
because it's precisely no skin off my nose.

421
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,910
It's your wedding, your big day.

422
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:33,150
No-one else minds what you do as long as you're happy.

423
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,000
That'll be John.

424
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,000
Lawrence?

425
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,600
I, erm...

426
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,040
Sorry. Could...?

427
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,230
This isn't your problem, clearly.

428
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,720
But just...just so you're aware...

429
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,160
Judith's pregnant.

430
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,200
Jud...?

431
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:10,760
How?

432
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:15,640
I mean, how...? How can...? Eight or nine weeks.

433
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:20,200
Is it yours? She...yes. She's not slept with anyone else.

434
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,910
So I dunno, I... Has she been to see a doctor?

435
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:26,110
Yes, just this week. And?

436
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:29,400
It's definitely not...something else?

437
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:31,760
Such as?

438
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,150
Does she want it?

439
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,400
I...it's...all very...

440
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:41,350
And the reason...the reason I'm telling you this

441
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:45,750
is that things might get a bit fraught round there,

442
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,440
given that it's all just reared its...

443
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,760
So...

444
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,750
..as much as I'm happy to have Lawrence for the weekend normally,

445
00:25:55,760 --> 00:26:01,470
if you wanted to take him with you instead, to Halifax, just this weekend,

446
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:05,000
I would completely understand that that might be the better option.

447
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,430
Not for you, obviously. But for him.

448
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,880
Popsi-Cola!

449
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,600
You're going to have to come with me. What?

450
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:17,360
To Gillian's. Why?

451
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,390
Because it's not a great weekend for us to do this,

452
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,710
as things have panned out... I'm not staying here.

453
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:27,030
No, we're going to Gillian's. I'm not going to stupid Gillian's!

454
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,800
I'm going to yours with you.

455
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:31,560
It's...Lawrence...

456
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,800
Hates me, I'm boring. No, you're not. Apparently.

457
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,600
Lawrence? You can't...!

458
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,120
You'll be on your mobile?

459
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,390
Hello! Hi.

460
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,270
Caroline. Robbie.

461
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:22,350
They're off to York Races for t'day.

462
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:25,470
Hello! Awww...!

463
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:28,510
I'm Cheryl! How do you do? I'm Robbie's better half!

464
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:31,720
Other half - what am I like?! Don't tell me!
