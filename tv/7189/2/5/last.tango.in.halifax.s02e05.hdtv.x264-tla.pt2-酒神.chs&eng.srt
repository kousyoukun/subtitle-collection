1
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:34,770
可惜天气不太好啊
Ain't it a shame about t'weather?

2
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,250
我喜欢你的外套
I like your jacket -

3
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:40,710
我喜欢那个图案 真的很经典
I love the pattern, it's really classy.

4
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:42,070
那么再见了!
Bye, then!

5
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,710
我不知道我们会到多晚      没事的
I don't know how late we'll be.        No problem.

6
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:47,240
爱你们 再见咯
Loving you and leaving you.

7
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:50,490
再见!      玩得开心点!
Bye!        Have a nice time!

8
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:51,860
这就是那个婴儿 那是爱丽
That's the baby. That's Ellie.

9
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:53,560
哦 我的天呐! 哦!
Oh, my God! Oh!

10
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:55,450
你是奶奶了
You're a grandmother. 

11
00:27:58,670 --> 00:28:00,320
她真讨人厌
She's annoying.

12
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:06,800
该死的约克比赛 有钱挥霍了
Bloody York Races. They've money to burn.

13
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:09,560
他有作业 她也有作业
He's got homework. She's got homework.

14
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,010
我以为 
I thought - 

15
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:13,040
你跟罗比不是...?
weren't you and Robbie...?

16
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:16,030
不 天呐 不是 几个月前就结束了
No. Hell, no. That went tits-up months ago.

17
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:16,940
哦
Oh,

18
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:19,680
不好意思
I'm sorry.

19
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:22,430
行啦 蝙蝠侠 有什么打算?
Right, Batman. What's the plan?

20
00:28:22,430 --> 00:28:24,720
找个好地方午餐
Lunch. Somewhere nice.

21
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,400
老实说... 我这礼拜手头有点紧
To be honest...I'm a bit skint this week.

22
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,710
我不紧 我... 我有钱
Well, I'm not. I'm...I'm loaded.

23
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:31,750
不能让你请我
I can't have you paying for me.        

24
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:33,400
怎么不行! 拿东西去
Yes, you can! Get your stuff.

25
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:37,730
我要不要打扮一下?
Do I need to get dressed up?

26
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,790
你愿意的话 可以啊
Only if you want to.

27
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:43,900
我们去哪儿?      惊喜
Where we going?        It's a surprise.

28
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:46,230
开谁的车去?      我无所谓!
Whose car we going in?        I don't care!

29
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:23,460
三个月前我和凯特来过这
I came here with Kate, three months ago.

30
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:26,070
我们分手那时很吓人
It was horrendous, it was when we fell out.

31
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:29,140
它非常适合举办婚礼 给我留下了深刻的印象
It struck me as being a nice place for a wedding.

32
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,560
我很遗憾你们分手了
I'm sorry you fell out.

33
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:34,930
跟我说说你妈妈和穆里尔 
Tell me about Muriel and your mum. 

34
00:29:34,930 --> 00:29:36,110
到底怎么回事啊?
What's all that about, then?

35
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:37,760
说来话长
It's a long story.

36
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,880
事情过去很久了
Well, it's an old story.

37
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:42,650
也许是我解读过度了
And it may be me reading too much into things.

38
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:44,670
我意思是 她从未正式说过什么
I mean, she's never actually said anything.

39
00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:46,010
老实说 你不一定要告诉我的
You don't have to tell me, honestly. 

40
00:29:46,010 --> 00:29:47,520
我只是八卦一下
I'm only being nosey.

41
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:52,740
我妈妈 他们搬去谢菲尔德后...
My mum, after they moved to Sheffield...

42
00:29:53,610 --> 00:29:55,740
也许是在跟你爸爸
..after - presumably - she'd given up on your dad

43
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:57,680
分开之后...
ever getting in touch...

44
00:29:58,150 --> 00:30:01,080
跟这个法兰克约会过
..went out with this lad, Frank.

45
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:03,810
显然是很正式的
It was serious, apparently.

46
00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:06,040
但之后结局却是...
But then the upshot was...

47
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:08,670
他娶了穆里尔
..he ended up marrying Muriel.

48
00:30:08,670 --> 00:30:10,750
不 不是吧!
No. No way!

49
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:13,040
当然 我妈妈觉得是她甩了他
Of course, my mum's version is that she dumped him,

50
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:15,450
之后才跟穆里尔开始交往的 但...
and THEN he took up with their Muriel. But...

51
00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:17,910
为什么她过了这么多年后对穆里尔的态度
..why would she be so funny about Muriel 

52
00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:19,210
还这么滑稽?
so many years on?

53
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:20,310
天呐
God.

54
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:22,380
我只知道...
All I know is...

55
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:26,270
我妈妈和穆里尔因为什么事争吵过
they'd had a spat about something, Muriel and my mum.

56
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:30,280
这也是很多年后 我和约翰结婚后了
This is - God - years ago, just after me and John got married.

57
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:33,490
穆里尔 她很生气 
And she was upset - Muriel was -

58
00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:35,520
所以我过去看看她
so I popped round to see her, 

59
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:38,670
看看可以做点什么火上浇油之类的事
to see if I could pour oil on...whatever.

60
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:43,690
她说 不管怎样
And she said, "What it is is,

61
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:47,710
在法兰克的事上 她永远不会真正原谅我的
"she's never really forgiven me about Frank".

62
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:51,130
我很傻地没问 什么意思?
And stupidly, I didn't say, "What do you mean?"

63
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:53,150
我就这么走了
I think I just left.

64
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:56,420
法兰克现在在哪儿?
Where is Frank?

65
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:59,090
几年前死了
Dead. Years ago.

66
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:04,160
你们两位要咨询婚礼服务?      是的!
Are you the two ladies enquiring about wedding facilities?         Yes!

67
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:06,430
你们要不要在午餐时看看简介图册?
Would you like to have a look at the brochures, over lunch?

68
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:08,490
之后我可以带你去转转?      谢谢
And then perhaps I can show you around?        Thank you.

69
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:10,120
谢谢
Thank you.

70
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:26,110
我知道你永远不会问
I know you wouldn't mention it, 

71
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:27,810
但有必要让你知道下...
but just so you know...

72
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:30,600
穆里尔一直不知道我和肯尼斯的事
Muriel never knew about me and Kenneth.

73
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:33,810
在发现他背叛我之后
About all the ups and downs we had 

74
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:36,360
我们争吵的那些事
after I found out he'd been mucking about behind my back.

75
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,630
好
OK.        

76
00:31:37,890 --> 00:31:40,560
正如我说的 我知道你不会 但...
Like I say, I know you wouldn't, but...

77
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:43,280
当危机来临时
Not the sort of sister you could confide in, then,

78
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:44,380
不是你可以信任的那种姐妹?
when it came to the crunch?

79
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:47,920
是的 是... 我们家的穆里尔可不行
No. No...not our Muriel.

80
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,670
那 你可以信任谁?
Well, who did you confide in?

81
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:52,420
谁都不能
Well, no-one.

82
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,500
没人 我不想让人知道
Nobody. I didn't want folk knowing.

83
00:31:55,970 --> 00:32:01,620
有一次我情绪特别低落 差点告诉我妈妈 
I nearly told my mother, once, when I was at a particularly low ebb.

84
00:32:02,370 --> 00:32:04,400
但... 这会让她伤心的
But...it would have broken her heart.

85
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:07,040
她会杀了他的 她会的!
And she'd have killed him. She would have!

86
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:11,450
所以 不要 我能自己处理
So, no. I dealt with it on my own.

87
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:15,040
之后当卡洛琳大一点开始懂事了
Then I told Caroline, eventually, 

88
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,780
我还是告诉她了
when she was old enough to understand.

89
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:21,160
然后...是啊
And then...yeah.

90
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:24,200
我只告诉了你
You're the only other person I ever told.

91
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:33,200
我定了晚上七点的位子
I've got a table booked for this evening for seven.

92
00:32:33,490 --> 00:32:34,790
就在这儿附近
It's just down here,

93
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:37,510
这里过去两条街有个意大利餐厅
we've an Italian restaurant just two streets away.

94
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:40,160
很好很漂亮 你们运气真好
It's very nice, it's very good, we're very lucky.

95
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:41,630
你喜欢意大利菜吗 艾伦?
Do you like Italian, Alan?

96
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:42,840
哦 我什么都吃!
Oh, I can eat anything!

97
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,150
今天下午
And this afternoon,

98
00:32:44,150 --> 00:32:46,960
马丁和乔安妮说他们会带女儿来访
Martin and Joanne said they'd pop in with the girls.

99
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,480
你有多少年没见过她们了 西莉亚?
How long is it since you've seen the girls, Celia?

100
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:50,940
他们长很大了!
They've shot up!

101
00:32:51,370 --> 00:32:53,040
马丁是我长子
Martin's my eldest.

102
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:55,590
劳拉以A级分数升二年级了
Laura's just started the second year of her A-levels,

103
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:57,350
她读得非常好
she's doing very well.

104
00:32:57,660 --> 00:33:00,720
威廉去牛津了 他怎么样啊?
William's gone to Oxford. How's he getting on?

105
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,750
还行 据我们所知 
Fine, as far as we know.

106
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:04,690
他才去了一周...      你有孙子女吗 艾伦?
He's only been there a week...     Do you have grandchildren, Alan?   

107
00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:07,360
只有一个 拉斐 拉弗
Just the one. Raphael. Raff.

108
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:10,360
他也以A级分数升二年级了
He's just started the second year of his A-levels as well, 

109
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:11,430
跟你家谁一样?
same as your...?

110
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:13,010
劳拉      劳拉
Laura.        Laura.

111
00:33:13,010 --> 00:33:15,910
你一定很为威廉骄傲
You must be so proud of him, William.

112
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:19,250
我一直认为骄兵必败 所以...
Well, I always think pride comes before a fall, so...

113
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:21,140
她当然为他骄傲了
Of course she's proud of him.

114
00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:23,700
他不是我的 我还为他骄傲呢!
I'm proud of him, he's not even my lad!

115
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:26,120
你女儿做什么的啊 艾伦?
Aw! What does your daughter do, Alan?

116
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:29,100
她务农 是农民 牧羊
She farms. She's a farmer. She farms sheep.

117
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:32,850
我猜 你说的很多事
Of all the things you might've said, and I'd been guessing,

118
00:33:32,850 --> 00:33:34,590
都跟他们有关!
that would not have been one of them!

119
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:37,440
养殖的是特殊品种吗?
Is it a special variety, breed?

120
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:40,520
不 不是 只是普通的黑面羊
No, no - just your bog-standard Swaledales.

121
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:42,510
很吸引人啊      或许吧
Fascinating.        It can be.

122
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:45,090
产羊羔!      哦 是的!
Lambing!        Oh, yes!

123
00:33:49,490 --> 00:33:51,380
跟我说说卡洛琳
Tell me about Caroline.        

124
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:53,530
说她什么?      她跟约翰
What about her?        Her and John.

125
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:55,000
哦 好
Oh, well.

126
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,970
他 呃... 开始跟别人胡搞
He, er...started messing about with somebody else.

127
00:33:57,970 --> 00:34:01,210
不... 不! 他是个白痴
No...no! He's an idiot.

128
00:34:01,210 --> 00:34:02,590
约翰? 是啊
John? Well, yeah.

129
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:03,820
我很遗憾
I am sorry.

130
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:06,120
大概一年前 18个月前
It was about a year ago. 18 months.

131
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,870
当然 他浪子回头了 是什么时候?
Course, he came crawling back - when was it?

132
00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:10,180
三四个月前
Three or four months since.

133
00:34:10,610 --> 00:34:12,470
意识到自己是个傻瓜 
Realising what a fool he'd been. 

134
00:34:12,470 --> 00:34:13,790
但...但她想通了
But... But she'd moved on.

135
00:34:13,790 --> 00:34:15,970
她意识到不再需要他了
Well, she realised she didn't need him any more.

136
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:16,930
对她而言是好事
Good for her.        

137
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:18,640
我也这么想      对她而言是好事
I think so.        Good for her.

138
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:20,860
当然 绝对的
Absolutely. Absolutely.

139
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,320
我再去倒壶茶 艾伦 如果...?
Well, I'm going to make another pot of tea, Alan, if...?

140
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,240
好的 是 谢谢
Smashing, yes. Thank you.

141
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:30,690
我们应该去花园 多好的天啊!
We should go into the garden. It's such a lovely day!

142
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:35,070
哦 我不知道还能忍多久
Oh, I don't know how much more of this I can stand.

143
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:36,220
怎么了?
What?

144
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:37,940
她以为自己是谁啊?
Who does she think she is?

145
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:40,130
你是做什么的 你个小人?
"And what do you do, you little person?"

146
00:34:40,130 --> 00:34:42,510
她似乎还不错
She seems right enough.

147
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:44,320
为什么问了个问题
Why do folk ask a question, 

148
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,920
在你要回答的时候又打断你?
and then interrupt as soon as you embark on an answer?

149
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:50,020
她只是见到你太高兴了 她只是...
She's just thrilled to see you, she's just...

150
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:52,300
我们家马丁 我们家劳拉
"Our Martin, our Laura."

151
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:55,570
她想闭嘴 却永远停不下来
She wants to put a sock in it, she never stops.

152
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:59,370
别告诉她卡洛琳的事
Do not tell her about Caroline.

153
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:04,110
我给你们来点奎宁杜松子酒吧?
Instead of tea, can I tempt anyone to a gin and tonic?

154
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:09,030
她会喜欢的      我也这么想
She'd love this.        So would he.

155
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:13,380
我们谈谈价格吧? 包装 协议 数量?
Can we talk about costs? Packages, deals, numbers?

156
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:16,460
当然! 要给你们来点香槟酒吗 女士们?
Of course! Can I offer you ladies a glass of champagne?

157
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:19,130
嗯... 好的 谢谢
Um...yes. Thank you.        

158
00:35:19,130 --> 00:35:20,490
等你们准备好了 
Do you want to join me in The Waterhouse Bar,

159
00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:21,830
再来沃特豪斯酒吧找我吧?
when you're ready?

160
00:35:24,050 --> 00:35:26,520
如果我喝多了 你能开我的路虎吗?
If I drink too much, can you drive my Land Rover?

161
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:29,000
如果我喝多了呢?
What if I drink too much?

162
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,700
我们就惨了
We'll be up shit creek.

163
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:51,150
我要出去
I'm going out.

164
00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:52,780
是这太吵了?
Is this too loud?

165
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:55,260
不! 不是 是我的问题 没事
No! No. It's me. It's fine.        

166
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:56,030
我们可以开轻些的
We can turn it down.

167
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:59,590
没事 只是... 我没法集中注意力
It's fine. It's just...I can't concentrate.

168
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:01,970
你要去哪儿?      随便走走
Where are you going?        Just for a walk.

169
00:36:01,970 --> 00:36:03,350
我们都去吧?      不
Shall we all go?        No.        

170
00:36:03,350 --> 00:36:04,150
我们可以一起去的
We can all go.

171
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:06,550
我只是... 不 不 你...
I just...no. No, you...

172
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:12,020
你出去的时候...能不能带点吃的
Perhaps you could get something for supper...while you're out.

173
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:14,360
匹萨或...?      好的
Pizzas or...?        Yeah.

174
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:15,840
你要去多久?
How long will you be?

175
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,340
我不知道 有关系吗?
I don't know, does it matter?

176
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:18,720
你带手机了吗?
Have you got your mobile?

177
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:28,380
她这年纪还能生吧?
Isn't she too old to be pregnant?

178
00:36:28,810 --> 00:36:31,340
...不能
Well...no.

179
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:32,880
她没事吧?
Is she all right?

180
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:35,930
我... 这...
I... It's...

181
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:38,710
你为什么问她带没带手机?
Why did you ask her if she'd got her mobile?

182
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:40,730
哦 她不能...
Oh, she can't...

183
00:36:40,730 --> 00:36:43,750
她不... 她有时候...      什么?
She doesn't... She sometimes...        What?

184
00:36:45,490 --> 00:36:47,050
我找她去
I'll just follow her.

185
00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:50,620
我只是去确认下她没有...
I'll just make sure she doesn't...

186
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:54,280
她不应该喝酒的      好吧
She shouldn't really be drinking, you see.        Right.

187
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:57,350
很快回来 经典结束语
Shan't be long. Famous last words.

188
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:11,590
哈利・沃伦思! 天呐 他有次约我出去的
Harry Wallace! Good Lord. He once asked me out.

189
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:13,560
哦 哈利谁都约
Oh, Harry asked everyone out.

190
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:14,730
哦 不好意思 不是那意思...
Oh, I'm sorry, not that...        

191
00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:16,840
不 没关系 我知道!
No, no, I know he did!

192
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,290
我没答应他!
I didn't say yes!

193
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:20,530
他约过你吗 西莉亚?
Did he ever ask you out, Celia?

194
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:22,660
他不敢
He wouldn't dare.

195
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:25,240
我们现在是亲戚了 我和哈利
We're related now, me and Harry.        

196
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,420
什么亲戚?
How?

197
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:30,080
哦 你没...告诉穆里尔...?
Oh, well - did you not...tell Muriel...?

198
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,840
呃 没有
Er, no. I hadn't.

199
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:37,030
我有曾孙女了 艾米丽 艾米丽・简
Well, I've got a great-grandchild. Emily. Emily Jane.

200
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:40,460
哈利的孙女和我外孙 拉弗
His - Harry's - granddaughter and my grandson, Raff.

201
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:41,470
他们已经...
They've...

202
00:37:41,470 --> 00:37:44,950
我以为... 你不是说他还在读书?
I thought...did you not say he was still doing his A-levels?

203
00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:47,300
是的! 他们很年轻
Yes! They're very young.        

204
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:49,090
他们都还在读书?
They're both still at school?

205
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:52,050
哇 好吧... 总会发生的
Oh. Well...it happens.

206
00:37:52,050 --> 00:37:53,350
他们很相爱
They're very fond of each other.        

207
00:37:53,350 --> 00:37:55,720
当然      他们不傻
Of course.        And they're not daft.

208
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:57,340
...显然如果傻的话
Well...they were, obviously, 

209
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:58,390
也不会有这事 但是...
or it wouldn't have happened, but...

210
00:37:58,390 --> 00:38:00,150
所以他们年纪到了
So they've risen to the occasion.

211
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:04,520
是的! 是的 似乎如此
Yes! Yes, they seem to be doing.

212
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:05,990
天呐
Gosh.

213
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:12,630
西莉亚 你觉得卡洛琳会再婚吗?
Do you think Caroline'll ever get married again, Celia?

214
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,840
有男朋友了吗?
Is there anyone?

215
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,310
她很有魅力...
Well, she's very attractive...

216
00:38:16,310 --> 00:38:18,710
我可不这么想 我觉得她看透了
I doubt it. I think she's seen the light.

217
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:20,840
看透了?      对于男人
Seen the light?        As regards men.

218
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:25,390
我觉得她明白了男人的目光短浅和无知
I think she's worked out what shallow-minded half-wits they are.

219
00:38:26,290 --> 00:38:27,860
哦 不是说你!
Oh, not you!

220
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:30,740
不是你 永远不是
Not you, never you.

221
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:34,120
真好 真完美
Aw, so wonderful. It's so perfect.

222
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:37,340
可惜没早几年遇到
What a shame it didn't happen all those years ago.

223
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:40,100
是啊 是啊
Yeah. Yeah.

224
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:42,670
有各种可能性
In oh-so many ways.

225
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:46,950
虽然那样我们就不可能有我们的卡洛琳和吉莉安了
Although we wouldn't have had our Caroline and our Gillian.

226
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:55,930
你好 亲爱的!
Hello, love!

227
00:38:55,930 --> 00:38:58,390
妈妈 我们来的这个地方好极了
Mum, this place we're visiting is perfect.

228
00:38:58,390 --> 00:39:00,820
我觉得你们会喜欢的 有各种选择
I think you'll love it - there are various options,

229
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:02,730
看你们打算怎么庆祝了
it depends how far you want to push the boat out,

230
00:39:02,730 --> 00:39:05,000
但老实说 我觉得你们会被吸引的
but honestly, I think you'll be charmed.

231
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:05,930
但重点是
But the point is 

232
00:39:05,930 --> 00:39:08,430
他们唯一还能定的
the only day they've got free this side of Christmas, 

233
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:09,770
是这个圣诞节
and it's a way off, 

234
00:39:09,770 --> 00:39:12,830
12月24日 星期二 所以...
is Tuesday the 24th of December, so...

235
00:39:12,830 --> 00:39:13,620
但那...
But that...

236
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:14,920
那是圣诞夜啊!
that's Christmas Eve!

237
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,250
我知道是圣诞夜!
'I know it's Christmas Eve!'

238
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:18,500
所以我们得做决定 因为很可能就没有了
So we need to make a decision, because it'll probably go,

239
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:19,970
他们很热门的 
they're very popular. 

240
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,710
我觉得他们以为我们要结婚
I think they think we're getting married

241
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:27,440
你能发我点图片吗 发到穆里尔的邮箱
Can you e-mail me some pictures, to Muriel's address,

242
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,760
我们看看?
so we can have a look?

243
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:30,040
等一下 妈妈
Just hang on, Mum.

244
00:39:30,990 --> 00:39:33,240
他们为 为什么会那样想?
W-Why would they think that?

245
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:38,080
我猜他们记得你带凯特来过这
I'm guessing that they remember you bringing Kate here,

246
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:43,460
他们以为我是你的另一个女人
and they think that I'm just another one of your women.

247
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:45,300
不!      你好?
No!        'Hello?'

248
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:46,960
你在吗? 卡洛琳?
Are you there? Caroline?

249
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:52,240
你好 不好意思
Hello? Sorry.

250
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,960
你能发些图片给我吗?
Can you e-mail me some pictures?

251
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:55,850
好 可以的
Yeah, I can.

252
00:39:55,850 --> 00:40:00,600
我手机里有...穆里尔的电子邮箱
I've...got Muriel's e-mail address on my phone.

253
00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:02,910
你在笑什么?
What are you laughing at?

254
00:40:02,910 --> 00:40:05,780
没什么 我们只是喝了点香槟酒而已
Nothing. We've just had some champagne, that's all.

255
00:40:06,770 --> 00:40:08,040
哦 别那样!      为什么?
Oh, don't do that!        Why not?        

256
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,790
太吓人了      哦 多谢
It's frightening.        Oh, thanks.

257
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:11,860
我肚子笑疼了
My pelvic floor isn't what it was.

258
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:13,830
如果你不当心点的话 我就跟你分手
I'm going to finish wi' you if you're not careful.

259
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:16,160
我听不到你说什么
I can't hear what you're saying.

260
00:40:17,350 --> 00:40:20,790
我会发些照片和报价单给你的 妈妈
I'm going to send you some photos and a list of costs, Mum.        

261
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:21,740
好的
'OK.'

262
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:23,270
你玩得开心吗?
Are you having a nice time?

263
00:40:23,270 --> 00:40:24,590
不开心
No.

264
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:28,280
不好意思是我多事 打给了她 
I'm sorry I rang her, I'm sorry I put my foot in it.

265
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:31,130
没事的 都过去了 你不知情
It's fine, it's forgotten. You didn't know.

266
00:40:31,130 --> 00:40:32,450
我爱你
I love you.

267
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:36,190
我爱你      再见
'I love you.'        Bye.

268
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:39,370
再见      再见
Bye.        Bye-bye.

269
00:40:47,730 --> 00:40:49,210
需要我们怎么做 女士们?
How are we doing, ladies?

270
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:09,010
好极了
That's fantastic.

271
00:41:09,010 --> 00:41:11,240
非常感谢 会的
Thank you very much, we will.

272
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:15,220
再见 再见 再见
Bye. Bye. Bye-bye.

273
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:17,840
?????

274
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:19,300
在他们那儿?      是的
Have they got it?        Yeah.

275
00:41:19,930 --> 00:41:23,320
酒醉的女校长把手机落在了酒吧
"Inebriated headmistress leaves phone in hotel bar."

276
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:25,840
酒醉的傻瓜把手机落在了酒吧
"Drunken pillock leaves phone in hotel bar."

277
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:29,270
模仿的不好 照搬照抄       60块
That's not good copy, that's just normal.        60.

278
00:41:33,570 --> 00:41:35,750
快点 开门 我要上厕所
Quick, open up, I need the loo.

279
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:41,730
哦 我从来不锁门 没什么可偷的
Oh, I never lock up. Nowt worth stealing.

280
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:46,220
<font color=#4096d1>Mum</font>

281
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:51,070
你好 我是卡洛琳
'Hello. This is Caroline.

282
00:41:51,070 --> 00:41:53,900
请留言 我会尽快回电给你
'Leave a message and I'll get back to you as quickly as I can.

283
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:59,780
妈妈? 爸爸出去了 出去很久了
Mum? Dad went out. Ages ago.

284
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:01,630
我联系不上他
I can't get hold of him.

285
00:42:01,630 --> 00:42:03,300
你能来接我吗?
Can you come and get me?

286
00:42:06,830 --> 00:42:08,720
你在哪儿? 为什么不接电话?
Where are you? Why aren't you answering?

287
00:42:12,870 --> 00:42:15,690
很抱歉 我说你烦
I'm sorry I said you were boring.

288
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:19,970
妈妈?
Mum?

289
00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:23,410
妈妈?
Mum?

290
00:42:28,350 --> 00:42:29,740
茶
Tea.

291
00:42:31,110 --> 00:42:32,840
你明天开车送我回来取路虎
You definitely all right for driving me back

292
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:34,340
确定没问题吧?
to pick up the Landy tomorrow?

293
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:36,660
没问题 我得去取手机 不是吗?
Well, yeah, I've got to get my phone, haven't I?

294
00:42:48,570 --> 00:42:50,290
你跟凯特?
What happened?

295
00:42:51,350 --> 00:42:52,630
发生什么事了?
With Kate?

296
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:59,830
我定了两间房欢度浪漫周末
I booked two separate rooms for a romantic weekend.

297
00:42:59,830 --> 00:43:01,670
你个傻女人
You knob.

298
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:04,950
别埋怨我
Don't go on at me.

299
00:43:07,310 --> 00:43:12,120
什么时候能回到...
What time will thingy and whats-it be back from...wherever-it-was

300
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:13,760
小时候?
with little doo-dah?

301
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:19,730
拉弗 埃莉 约克 灾难
Raff. Ellie. York. Calamity.

302
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,540
我不知道
I've no idea.

303
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:27,670
你能给我间房吗?
Will you have room for me?

304
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:30,710
我们一直给你留了房间
We've always got room for you.

305
00:43:36,790 --> 00:43:38,820
我跟凯特玩完了
I blew it with Kate.

306
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,400
我真的搞糟了
I really blew it.

307
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:49,540
现在我真的意识到那有多美好
I only realise now how lovely it was.

308
00:43:50,610 --> 00:43:52,440
多珍贵
How precious.

309
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:58,880
我想道歉 但她不听
And I've tried to apologise, but she won't listen.

310
00:43:59,870 --> 00:44:02,680
我觉得她已经打定主意我对她不好了
I think she's decided that I'm bad for her.

311
00:44:04,090 --> 00:44:08,280
不管我做什么说什么
And there's nothing I can do or say.

312
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:13,650
我现在被贴上了坏字的标签 
I'm in this box now, with "bad" written on it.

313
00:44:17,090 --> 00:44:20,210
不是坏 只是...
Well, not "bad." Just...

314
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:24,970
自负
"Arrogant."

315
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,620
愚蠢
"Inept."

316
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:31,660
自私
"Selfish."

317
00:44:32,970 --> 00:44:35,030
压抑
"Repressed."

318
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:40,940
只是感情上的...废人
Just, emotionally...crippled.

319
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:46,260
你没事吧?
You all right?

320
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:54,440
你跟罗比呢?
What about you and Robbie?

321
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:58,890
哦 我和罗比
Oh - me and Robbie.

322
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:03,980
那是另一回事了
That's a different sort of thing altogether.

323
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:07,590
为什么?
Why?

324
00:45:17,730 --> 00:45:21,290
你要不要来点白兰地酒?
Do you fancy a drop of brandy in your tea?

325
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:24,490
你要吗?
Are you?

326
00:45:33,460 --> 00:45:36,110
哦 希望我们的决定是对的
Oh, I hope we've made the right decision.

327
00:45:36,110 --> 00:45:38,370
我觉得它看起来很合适
I think it looks spot-on.

328
00:45:38,370 --> 00:45:41,930
要我说卡洛琳有一样好 就是眼光不错
One thing I will say for Caroline - she has good taste.

329
00:45:41,930 --> 00:45:45,380
我们现在定下来了 他们已经付了定金
Well, we're committed now, they've paid the deposit.

330
00:45:45,380 --> 00:45:48,430
我跟她通话的时候 她有点醉了
Although she sounded a bit pissed when I spoke to her.

331
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:52,530
这是...肯尼斯?      是啊
Is this...Kenneth?        Yeah.

332
00:45:53,350 --> 00:45:54,940
是他
That's him.

333
00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:01,140
她似乎很喜欢你 穆里尔
She seems very fond of you, Muriel.

334
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:02,590
考虑到...
Considering...

335
00:46:02,590 --> 00:46:03,980
考虑到什么?
Considering what?

336
00:46:03,980 --> 00:46:07,850
那... 你似乎不太喜欢她
Well, that...you don't seem very fond of her.

337
00:46:07,850 --> 00:46:10,600
哦...她永远是对的
Oh...she's right enough.

338
00:46:11,610 --> 00:46:14,070
是...      什么?
It's...        What?

339
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:20,230
哦... 她总是要成为焦点
Oh...she's always has to be the centre of attention.

340
00:46:20,730 --> 00:46:23,670
穆里尔不会去参加一个派对
She can't just come to a party, Muriel - 

341
00:46:23,670 --> 00:46:25,400
必须自己举办一个
she has to BE the party.

342
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:28,620
有些人总是需要那些 不是吗?
Well, some people are needy that way, aren't they?

343
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:31,100
需要? 就这样?
Needy? Is that what it is?

344
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:34,700
害怕被落下 害怕被忽视
Scared of being left out. Scared of being overlooked.

345
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:39,760
所以他们争强好胜地冲到最前面 
So they push their way to the front, with their sharp elbows.

346
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:44,720
有些人觉得那很吸引人 但我肯定不觉得
Some people might find that attractive, but I'm damned certain I don't.

347
00:46:46,610 --> 00:46:48,720
你在担心这?
Is that what you're bothered about?

348
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:50,200
如果她去了婚礼
If she came to t'wedding,

349
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:54,030
会让你觉得不是你的而是她的好日子?
she'd make you feel like it were her big day, rather than yours?

350
00:46:55,900 --> 00:46:57,850
差不多 是的
Something like that, yes.

351
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:04,420
跟你比起来
She's very plain, you know.

352
00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:06,860
她很一般
Compared to you.

353
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:11,230
她没让我笑了一整天 一次都没有
And she hasn't made me laugh all day. Not once.

354
00:47:11,230 --> 00:47:16,300
我认为 我们结婚的那天 你我一起
I think the day we get married, you and me together,

355
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:19,960
会占了所有人的风头 是吧?
we'll eclipse everyone else entirely - don't you?

356
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:23,990
那是她丈夫?
Was that her husband?

357
00:47:24,860 --> 00:47:29,050
是的 法兰克 是法兰克
Yeah. Frank. That's Frank.

358
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:32,550
他去世了
He's dead.

359
00:47:39,930 --> 00:47:41,580
所以事情就是这样
So here's the thing.

360
00:47:42,930 --> 00:47:44,450
就是这样
This is the thing.

361
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:50,180
我和罗比
Me and Robbie.

362
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:57,620
我 我一直 非常 非常喜欢他
I am - I've always been - very, very, very fond of him.

363
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:01,930
我本应该继续跟他在一起的
I should've stuck with him.

364
00:48:02,540 --> 00:48:04,000
罗比
Robbie.

365
00:48:07,730 --> 00:48:09,390
但是艾迪...
But Eddie...

366
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:14,420
他...
He was...

367
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:18,590
只是其中一个...
..just one of those men who...

368
00:48:19,290 --> 00:48:20,700
哦 天呐
Oh, God.

369
00:48:23,250 --> 00:48:25,580
我跟他在一起的时候 什么都不放在眼里
When I was with him, nothing else mattered. 

370
00:48:25,580 --> 00:48:26,640
任何事
Nothing.

371
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:29,140
如果你在哈利法克斯丢个氦原子弹
You could've dropped a helium bomb on Halifax

372
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:30,840
我也不会注意到的
and I wouldn't have noticed.

373
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:34,210
是氢原子
It was hydrogen.

374
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:42,810
我不该那么对罗比的
I shouldn't have done that to Robbie.

375
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:48,310
但我就是忍不住
But I couldn't help it.

376
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:52,640
不能
I couldn't.

377
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,890
但你肯定已经克服了
But you'd got over that, surely, before -

378
00:48:55,890 --> 00:49:00,440
你和罗比 又开始约会的时候
you and Robbie, when you started going out with each other again...

379
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:02,430
是啊
Mm, yeah. We did.

380
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:07,060
但...
But...

381
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,240
他跟那个夏丽尔不会长久的 是吧?
It's not going to last with that Cheryl, is it?

382
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:12,630
他很快会跟她分的
He'll soon get to the end of her.

383
00:49:12,630 --> 00:49:13,990
他显然只在乎...
He's obviously only bothering...        

384
00:49:13,990 --> 00:49:15,660
是啊 是啊 管他呢
Yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever.

385
00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:17,890
我知道 我知道
I know that. I know that.

386
00:49:18,610 --> 00:49:19,980
不好意思
Sorry.

387
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:25,070
虽然拉弗说 她已经搬去他那儿了
Although Raff reckons she's moving in with him.

388
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:30,370
我是不是漏了什么?
Am I missing the point?

389
00:49:30,870 --> 00:49:34,210
没有 没有
No. No. No.

390
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:37,350
我
I...

391
00:49:41,510 --> 00:49:45,060
认为
..don't think...ever...

392
00:49:48,630 --> 00:49:51,420
我和罗比不适合在一起
..me and Robbie could be a good idea.

393
00:49:54,190 --> 00:49:58,440
虽然 如果一切顺利的话 我们本可以在一起的
Even though, all things being equal, we could've been.

394
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:00,600
为什么?
Why?

395
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:05,260
我们本可以好好在一起的
We could've been really nice together.

396
00:50:06,090 --> 00:50:08,430
你为什么觉得现在不可以呢?
Why do you think you can't be?

397
00:50:13,450 --> 00:50:18,610
我背着他做了蠢事
I did the...shittiest thing to him.

398
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:26,760
我从没告诉过别人 卡洛琳
I never told anyone this, Caroline.

399
00:50:27,470 --> 00:50:31,620
我...醉得很厉害      我也是
I'm...very drunk.        So am I.

400
00:50:31,620 --> 00:50:32,390
是吗?      是啊 
Are you?        Yeah.    

401
00:50:32,390 --> 00:50:33,870
真的吗?      是的
Really?        Yeah.

402
00:50:33,870 --> 00:50:36,750
跟我一样醉?      不知道 我很醉了
As drunk as me?        I don't know, I'm pretty drunk.

403
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:39,550
别告诉我 你会后悔的事
Don't tell me something you're going to regret.

404
00:50:39,550 --> 00:50:42,820
我想告诉你      好吧
I want to tell you.        OK.

405
00:50:48,390 --> 00:50:50,750
我
I...

406
00:50:55,090 --> 00:50:56,560
杀了他
