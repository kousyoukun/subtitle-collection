1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:04,870
So you're her, are you?
You're the whore.
"Emily Jane Greenwood-Wallace".

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:08,950
Well that's a gob-full, for someone
who only weighs 6lbs 3oz.

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,350
You can't call a baby that!

4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,510
What've they called it?

5
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:14,190
Calamity Jane.

6
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,990
I was so delighted when you told me
you'd booked this place.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,270
And then you go and book
two separate rooms.

8
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:22,430
That bungalow we went to see
when I said we were just looking...

9
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,350
We've put in an offer.

10
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:25,560
Maurice is dead.

11
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:31,310
Greg!
Kate!

12
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,110
- Have you slept together?
- No!

13
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,270
Are you dumping me?

14
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,960
I don't think anything ever
really started, did it?

15
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,310
Will you marry me? Again?

16
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,360
Go on, then.

17
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,270
Yeah! Yes!

18
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:00,150
Are you absolutely sure you need
all this stuff? Yes.

19
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:04,830
You'll only have it all to cart back
again at the end of term. And?

20
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,910
Are you nearly ready?

21
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,470
Yeah!
I've just got one more bag upstairs.

22
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:11,400
Nip round
and tell Granny William's going.

23
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,230
Have you had the divorce
papers in the post?

24
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,470
Yes. Have you signed them?

25
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,030
Yes.

26
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,150
Did you send them back
by registered post?

27
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,550
I sent them back.

28
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,710
By registered post?

29
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,430
It said specifically to return them
by registered post.

30
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:27,950
Oh for f...! I have saved you
thousands of pounds in lawyers' fees

31
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,670
by organising this online.

32
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,110
The very least you could do is...

33
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,240
Got it!

34
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,040
They're going!
Ey up, Alan! They're going!

35
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,390
Ring me when you get there.

36
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,950
Only if you want to, only if
you're not busy. Or drop me a text.

37
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,110
I'll ring you.
I wish I could come with you.

38
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,080
You've got a school to run!

39
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,480
I am proud of you.

40
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,750
I'm proud of you.

41
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,270
WAY-HEY!
Finally, we get rid of him!

42
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:13,110
Why does he exist? Beano boy.
Yeah, special needs.

43
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,350
Stop it.

44
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,950
The concert party's arrived!
Just in time!

45
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,390
How long does it take
to drive to Oxford?

46
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,070
Three or four hours, I would think.

47
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,990
Nah! Foot down, two-and-a-half.

48
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,070
Please drive properly.

49
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,470
Good luck, lad! Work hard.
Enjoy yourself.

50
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,720
Thanks, Grandad.

51
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,350
See ya, Gran.

52
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,750
Aww! Here, get your washing done
regularly.

53
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,510
Girls like boys with clean
underwear,

54
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,590
don't let anyone tell you different.

55
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,470
Do I get a twencer, Gran?

56
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,600
Yeah! When you get in at Oxford.

57
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,120
Bye! Bye!

58
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,310
I need a poo.

59
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,280
Ooh! That egg'll be boiling.

60
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,920
You all right, love?

61
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,870
Yeah.

62
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,670
I was, um...

63
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,920
Big day.

64
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,910
Me and Alan are off over
to Ripponden today.

65
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:33,030
We said we'd help out with the baby.

66
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,990
Still back and forth.

67
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,470
It's a shame that bungalow
fell through.

68
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,750
How're the wedding plans going?

69
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:42,270
Oh, we never seem to get any closer.

70
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,870
Why?

71
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:48,910
Well, for one reason, he's gone
and invited Ted. His brother.

72
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,390
I didn't know Alan had a brother.

73
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,950
Yeah. Ted.
He was two years above us.

74
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,710
Right.

75
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,670
So, what's wrong with Ted coming?

76
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,030
He's in New Zealand.

77
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:01,150
He's got five kids and they're all
married

78
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:04,470
and they've got 13 grandchildren
between them,

79
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,390
and, God knows why, but,

80
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:11,350
because they've never met Alan,
they all want to come over.

81
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,640
Oh, gosh. So...?

82
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:16,790
Well, we weren't planning on having
that big a venue, really.

83
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,470
But now it's all become
a logistical nightmare.

84
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,070
How?

85
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,350
Oh, well, it has.

86
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,470
How?

87
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,400
One of them's a vegetarian.

88
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:32,590
Well, that's not insurmountable,
is it, as problems go?

89
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,230
Oh, it's all...
"where are they staying?"

90
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:38,430
and God knows what, and "will they
all get a flight at the same time?"

91
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,910
Right.

92
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:43,710
You see, this is why we just wanted
to do it all on the quiet.

93
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:47,200
Well, you did.
And then you decided to do this.

94
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,520
Have y'had any more inquiries?

95
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,800
No, not this week.

96
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,950
She's done, can you take her?
I've not brushed my teeth.

97
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,470
I'm making you a sandwich.

98
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,800
Yeah, but she needs
to get her wind up.

99
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,630
Ugh! Have you not done her nappy?

100
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,750
Yeah. She hasn't...?

101
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:35,790
I think she has.

102
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,630
Is there any tea left in that pot?

103
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:40,390
Yeah, probably, if you squeeze it!

104
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,510
Mum, can you take Calamity?
She needs burping.

105
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,870
You're going to be late.

106
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:45,960
Yeah, I do know!

107
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,950
You don't want to be missing
the bus, not this morning.

108
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,910
I can't drive you, I'm taking hogs
to t'livestock mar...

109
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,670
Has she...?

110
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,000
Yeah, sorry.

111
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:03,240
Calamity, is there no end
to your shining wealth of talents?

112
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,670
Ey, Mum. What?

113
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,310
It's been a month. It's a month
today since Ellie moved in.

114
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,790
You said you'd make a decision.

115
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,670
Yeah.

116
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,040
So?

117
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,920
Yeah.

118
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,870
Yeah. As long Yvonne doesn't stop
slinging me the cash every week

119
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,950
for her housekeeping.

120
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,870
So you're happy.

121
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,630
Well, happy's pushing it, but, yeah.

122
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:32,710
As long as she keeps pulling
her weight. She will.

123
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,280
Is she happy? With everything?

124
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:40,080
She'd rather be here than
with her mother.

125
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:46,190
Oh, and we won't be in for us
teas tonight,

126
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,590
me, Ellie and Calamity.

127
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,040
Robbie's invited us down to his.

128
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,670
Cheryl's cooking.

129
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,000
Right. Is she?

130
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,440
She's moving in with him,
apparently.

131
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,720
Right.

132
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,720
Sorry. Hello.

133
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,950
Beverley said
you might have a few minutes.

134
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:38,440
I can come back later.
No. No. Come in.

135
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,040
Sure.

136
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,400
OK. Well...

137
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,600
Amazingly, I'm pregnant.

138
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,880
It was 12 weeks on Saturday.

139
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,920
So... I'm cautiously starting to
think about the future.

140
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,680
And, what I'd like to do,
if nothing...

141
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,590
..is work up until next Easter.

142
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,950
Then, ideally, if it's possible,

143
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,790
if it's something you can
accommodate,

144
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,150
I'd like to come back part-time.

145
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,510
This time next year.

146
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,550
Autumn term.

147
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,550
Right.

148
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,310
How possible is that?

149
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,990
I know you've always been very good
in the past

150
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,830
with women who've left to
start families

151
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:34,040
and then wanted to go part-time.

152
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,110
You'll have to leave it with me.

153
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,470
If what you're really thinking is,
"You'll be lucky",
I'd rather you just said.

154
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,840
I hope you know me better than that.

155
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,960
I just need time to work out
the logistics, that's all.

156
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,120
Sorry.

157
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,520
OK.

158
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,520
Thank you.

159
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,550
Congratulations.

160
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,680
Thank you. Thanks.

161
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,190
You're too late, you've missed her!
Who?

162
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,230
Calamity! Harry's been
and fetched her. You all right?

163
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,990
Yeah! Very fair.

164
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,990
Hi, Celia.
Are you all right, love?

165
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,040
Not so bad.

166
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,110
Where is she?

167
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,030
With Harry.
He wants you to text him.

168
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,030
He's got summat
he wants to show you, he said,

169
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,430
down by t'wharf in Sowerby Bridge.

170
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:11,150
Is that where he's taken the baby?
Well, I'm assuming.

171
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,470
What's he wanting to show us?

172
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,910
I have no idea,
but he seemed very excited.

173
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,510
That's sounds ominous.

174
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,710
Down by t'wharf?
Yup.

175
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,870
What is there down at t'wharf?

176
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:25,310
Water? Ducks? Geese?
Industrial waste?

177
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,910
Are we setting straight off, then?

178
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:29,590
Make yourself a cup o' tea if you
want to. I've got to get to Otley.

179
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,470
I'll just use the bathroom,
if that's...

180
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,520
Right. OK.

181
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,670
Are you...? Keeping fit?

182
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:45,390
Yeah! Yeah, I think so.

183
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,630
Have you not got a date sorted yet?

184
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,910
Oh, have we buggery.

185
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:52,310
Only Ted Skyped again last night.
They're all itching to book flights.

186
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,480
It's her sister.

187
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,110
Has Celia got a sister?

188
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:59,430
Muriel. She were in t'year below us
at grammar school.

189
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,590
She lives in Sheffield.

190
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,430
So, what's up wi' Muriel?

191
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,870
Celia seems to have a very...
What?

192
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,070
..ambivalent relationship
with her.

193
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,750
Right. How come?

194
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:13,070
I've no idea. We don't go there.

195
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:16,230
Upshot is, she can't decide whether
she wants her at t'wedding or not.

196
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,670
Right.

197
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,110
Whereas I can't wait to
get on with it.

198
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,070
I know! I know.

199
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,510
Celia does seem to have quite...

200
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:28,950
complex relationships with people,
I've noticed.

201
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:32,400
I'll get to t'bottom of it.
Right. Good luck.

202
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,350
Oh, text Harry.

203
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,400
Oh, aye.

204
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,160
It's nice to see you.

205
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,760
Eh! Are you all right, love?

206
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:47,200
Me? Yeah! God, yeah!

207
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:51,320
Ta'ra! Ta'ra!

208
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,870
Be honest. Well, it's, eh...

209
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,670
I think you're crackers.
You haven't actually
sold your house?

210
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,710
No, but that's plan.
It's up for sale.

211
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,190
What, and you're going to live on
it, permanently? Through the winter?

212
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:16,510
It's grand and warm. There's
going to be a wood-burning stove,

213
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:22,510
telly, DVD, drinks cabinet.
satellite dish.

214
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:25,200
Come and have a look. No!

215
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:31,440
Gordon said we can take it
for a spin down Cut. Yeah, come on.
Ooh, don't!

216
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,790
It were after Maurice died.
You have to seize the day.

217
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,030
It's something I've always fancied,
as far back as ever I can remember.

218
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,430
How do you go on opening locks
on your own?

219
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:50,190
Piece of piss, what you on about?
Hey, ladies present.

220
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,910
Oh, I've heard worse.
I meant baby.

221
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:56,190
He means when you get
even older, you dozy old sod.

222
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:59,990
How're you going to open locks when
you're juggling with a Zimmer frame?

223
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,160
Nay, I'll shoot me sen
before I get to that stage!

224
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:08,910
He'll sell his house, live on it
for two or three weeks
and then he'll get fed up.

225
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:11,590
He misses Maurice. Aw.

226
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,190
Is it just three of us for supper?
Yeah.

227
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,590
Where have Raff and Ellie taken
Calamity, then? Oh, just...

228
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:24,070
Robbie - Robbie's... He's got
this new girlfriend. Cheryl.

229
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:27,230
So - he works with her.
She's a copper.

230
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:30,110
She's blonde, gorgeous,

231
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,830
15 years younger than him, divorced.

232
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:35,800
Is he making a point? Yeah.

233
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:40,110
Of course he is.
He's always hated her up to now.

234
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:43,590
Gone on about how annoying
and dippy she is. So, yeah.

235
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:49,990
Men, transparent. What can you do?
Present company excepted, obviously.

236
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:56,190
Except Raff says she's
moving in with him. Apparently.

237
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,720
John's back with Judith.

238
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,150
I'm really not interested
in John, Celia.

239
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,870
Thanks. Really, really not.

240
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,120
Oh, no, I was just saying.

241
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,840
I mean, God knows why.

242
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,070
I honestly don't think
they can stand each other.

243
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,430
It's just a habit. A bad habit.

244
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,350
How's Caroline?

245
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,990
She's all right.

246
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,630
Oh, yeah!

247
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:24,270
Celia...tell me about your sister!

248
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,310
I didn't know you had a sister.

249
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,560
Oh...

250
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:32,310
Shame the wedding plans
have got bogged down cos of her.

251
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:36,550
Oh, it's not cos of our Muriel,
it's cos of Ted, isn't it?

252
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,630
About them not being able
to make their minds up

253
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,070
when they're coming over

254
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:42,030
and where they're all going to stay,
and...

255
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,550
No. No, I don't think so.

256
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:47,240
Ted's waiting for you to fix a date
so they can all book their flights.

257
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,790
Oh.

258
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,310
Well, I got the impression...

259
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:54,070
No, no, there's no problem there.
Is there? Dad?

260
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:58,470
Er...well, it'll be tricky for 'em
co-ordinating everything,

261
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,870
but, erm...no.

262
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:03,950
No, I don't think the problem
is wi' our Ted, really.

263
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,590
Anyway, that's their problem.

264
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,150
You set a date, they turn up,
if they can.

265
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,430
I don't think they expect you
to organise it around them.

266
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,070
They don't. They absolutely don't.

267
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,440
They're not like that.

268
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,150
Have you heard from Will?

269
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,000
Yeah, he's fine. I got a text.

270
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,320
Can I go and live with my dad?

271
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,800
Why do you want to do that?

272
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:01,560
He's not...boring.

273
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:04,910
Sorry.

274
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:07,000
I really don't think
that's a good idea.

275
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,160
I'm sorry if you think I'm...

276
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:16,470
..not very exciting,
but I've seen Judith's flat.

277
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,870
You wouldn't want to live there,

278
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:20,270
you wouldn't want to spend
more than five minutes there.

279
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,990
Hello? Caroline? It's Gillian.

280
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,910
'Oh, hello.'

281
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,150
How are you?

282
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,990
Fine! Fine.

283
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,590
Good.

284
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,990
'Are you?' Yeah! Yeah.

285
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,670
I was ringing you...about
the wedding.

286
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,310
I'm just concerned.

287
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:52,070
I thought you might be able to throw
a bit of light on something. OK.

288
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,790
It all seems to have got
bogged down, somehow.

289
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,470
And...I think it's making me dad
a bit miserable.

290
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:03,070
Oh! I know. is it not to do
with...um...uh, Ted, his brother?

291
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:05,270
No. No, it isn't.

292
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,600
'That's what my mum said.'

293
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,110
She's using that as an excuse.

294
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,630
I did wonder.

295
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,830
I think it's to do with her sister.
Muriel?

296
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:17,950
Right. Right.

297
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,510
Ted's fine, honestly.

298
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,710
He's really easygoing,
he just wants to fit in.

299
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,310
Yeah - it's...

300
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,670
That wouldn't surprise me, Muriel.

301
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,430
Is she...difficult?

302
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,110
Auntie Muriel? No! God, no.
She's...

303
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:34,230
They're just chalk and cheese,
that's all. 'OK.'

304
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,110
Only if we could get to t'bottom
of whether she's coming or not,

305
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,950
they could move forward
with things, that's all.

306
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,270
Oh, she'll be coming.
I don't think she wouldn't come.

307
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:45,830
Well, pinning it down, then,
so they can set a date.

308
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:50,150
Could you ring her? Muriel?
Yeah, sure.

309
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,470
Find out what stage they're at
in their delicate negotiations,

310
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:56,030
cos I've got Ted and his lot
Skyping every five minutes

311
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:58,190
'wanting to know when they can book
their flights.

312
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,550
'Sooner they can book,
cheaper it'll be.'

313
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,670
Course. Of course. OK.
Leave it with me.

314
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:05,110
It's just...they're just...it's...

315
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,110
Complicated.

316
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:10,240
Yeah. Yeah.

317
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,190
Oh, hell! Orange again.

318
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,230
I hate sport and nature.

319
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,870
No, it's sport and leisure.

320
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,230
No, that's green.

321
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,350
No, that's science and nature.

322
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:25,360
Is it? Yeah. Oh, OK.

323
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:29,230
Sherlock Holmes.
The Beatles. Shakespeare.

324
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,310
Sorry? The answer.

325
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,310
But I haven't asked t'question yet.

326
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:35,230
No, I know,
but it will be one of them.

327
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,670
It always is, the answer.

328
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,960
Or Manchester United.

329
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,950
I've been thinking.
Oh, aye? What with?

330
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,550
Oh, you're so funny(!)

331
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:50,200
Why don't I... Why don't me and
Caroline organise the wedding?

332
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,310
Really? Yeah.

333
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:55,070
Only you seem to have got stuck

334
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,550
and I can't believe
you WANT to be stuck. So...

335
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,990
Well, I...

336
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,870
We'd run everything past you.
We wouldn't do anything you'd hate.

337
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:04,990
Have you spoken to her?
Just now, just this second.

338
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,310
Oh. Well...

339
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,510
Why don't we just check out
some venues for you, at least?

340
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,470
We'll suss a few out
and then you choose.

341
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,710
And we'll compile an invite list

342
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:17,640
and then you can...cross anyone out
that you don't really want.

343
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,910
Well...I don't know.

344
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:25,230
I suppose so, if you wanted to.

345
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,910
We would love to. I would love to.

346
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,350
Oh, who's this?

347
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,680
Muriel!

348
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,270
Hello!

349
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,080
Hello?
I've just put my foot right in it!

350
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,510
Have you? Why?

351
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,590
She didn't know -
Muriel didn't even know.

352
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,070
My mother hadn't even told her!

353
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,590
Wow. Wow. That's...

354
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,630
Alan Buttershaw!

355
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,470
That's...it's so perfect!
It's wonderful.

356
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,550
Gosh, you must be so happy.

357
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:58,470
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I am.

358
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,190
So when is it? The wedding?

359
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,030
Well, we've - we've...

360
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:04,990
Um...how did you know?

361
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,310
Caroline.
Caroline just rang, just now.

362
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,510
I am so deep in the doghouse,

363
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,270
it won't ever be worth
trying to get out.

364
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,310
It's not your fault.

365
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,350
Our Caroline?

366
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:15,670
You don't know what it's like.
Caroline, you didn't know.

367
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,430
Oh, damn! She's spoilt the surprise!

368
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:21,550
I was thinking of popping down
this...this very weekend,

369
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:24,550
this coming weekend, to tell you.

370
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,950
Both of us, me and Alan.

371
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,000
How's she taking it?

372
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,920
She's smiling, she's happy.

373
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,150
She's laughing!

374
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,680
Yeah, well that's just...

375
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,470
You wait till she comes
off the phone.

376
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,710
It'll be Armageddon.

377
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,430
The forces of Gog and Magog

378
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,630
will gather from the four corners
of the earth...

379
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,350
You're losing me, Caroline.
Yeah, well, good luck.

380
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,350
I've offered to organise
the wedding for them.

381
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,760
And I said you'd help me.

382
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,910
Hello?

383
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,830
'Go on!

384
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,550
'Come on, we'll have a laugh.'

385
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,670
I could use a laugh, couldn't you?

386
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,160
I'm...

387
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,520
..bloody well fed-up.

388
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,550
'I have been for months.'

389
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,120
Yeah. Yeah...

390
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,310
Yeah, all right.

391
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:20,110
Oh, wonderful! That'd be lovely.

392
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:22,190
So this coming weekend?

393
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,830
How are you fixed
this coming weekend?

394
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,670
Yes, well, if that was the plan,
if that fits in with you and Alan,

395
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,230
it's absolutely fine with me.

396
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,710
You'll be thinking
I wasn't going to tell you.

397
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,030
'No! No.'

398
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:34,350
And nothing could be
further from the truth.

399
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,950
No, you wanted to surprise me -
that's nice!

400
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,190
Yeah...

401
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,550
Well, give Alan my love.

402
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,870
I will.

403
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,870
Oh, Caroline was telling me
her and John are getting divorced.

404
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:46,590
Oh - what else did she tell you?

405
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,070
Nothing, she didn't have time.

406
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,710
I wanted to ring you
to say congratulations.

407
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,470
You'll have to fill me in
when I see you.

408
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,630
Yeah.

409
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,310
OK, then. Aw! Bye-bye.

410
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,400
Bye, bye. Bye-bye!

411
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,160
Who were that?

412
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,840
Muriel - our Muriel.

413
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,750
Nice.

414
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,160
Yeah.

415
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,280
Whose roll is it?

416
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,550
I don't know what Caroline
was thinking of,

417
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,950
ringing our Muriel.

418
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,670
Well, she'd have assumed -
and she wasn't alone -

419
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:31,070
that you'd spoken to Muriel
any number of weeks ago.

420
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,830
Well, I never said I had.

421
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:36,510
If you don't want her there,
we won't invite her.

422
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:38,590
What're you smiling at? You.

423
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:41,510
Whenever have I said
I didn't want her there?

424
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,910
It's an impression you've given.

425
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,200
I don't know how.

426
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:49,110
She's always to be interfering.
Who?

427
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:52,550
Caroline - always has to be
organising everybody.

428
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:55,950
Of course I want my sister
at my wedding!

429
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:58,990
Good! Good.

430
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,670
I don't know why you've got
that expression on your face.

431
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,440
She's all right, our Muriel.

432
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,520
In small doses.

433
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,670
And if Gillian told you
to jump off a cliff,

434
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,310
what would your response to that be?

435
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:18,150
Mum, I've explained what happened.
I won't go through it again,

436
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,550
because you are choosing not to hear
what's being said.

437
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:23,710
What YOU have to decide -
when you're calmer -

438
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,990
is whether you want Muriel there
on the day or not,

439
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,150
because it's precisely no skin
off my nose.

440
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,910
It's your wedding, your big day.

441
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:33,150
No-one else minds what you do
as long as you're happy.

442
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,000
That'll be John.

443
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,000
Lawrence?

444
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,600
I, erm...

445
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,040
Sorry. Could...?

446
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,230
This isn't your problem, clearly.

447
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,720
But just...just so you're aware...

448
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,160
Judith's pregnant.

449
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,200
Jud...?

450
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:10,760
How?

451
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:15,640
I mean, how...? How can...?
Eight or nine weeks.

452
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:20,200
Is it yours? She...yes.
She's not slept with anyone else.

453
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,910
So I dunno, I...
Has she been to see a doctor?

454
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:26,110
Yes, just this week. And?

455
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:29,400
It's definitely
not...something else?

456
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:31,760
Such as?

457
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,150
Does she want it?

458
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,400
I...it's...all very...

459
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:41,350
And the reason...the reason
I'm telling you this

460
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:45,750
is that things might get
a bit fraught round there,

461
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,440
given that it's all just
reared its...

462
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,760
So...

463
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,750
..as much as I'm happy to have
Lawrence for the weekend normally,

464
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,350
if you wanted to take him
with you instead,

465
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:01,470
to Halifax,
just this weekend,

466
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:05,000
I would completely understand that
that might be the better option.

467
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,430
Not for you, obviously. But for him.

468
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,880
Popsi-Cola!

469
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,600
You're going to have to come
with me. What?

470
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:17,360
To Gillian's. Why?

471
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,390
Because it's not a great weekend
for us to do this,

472
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,710
as things have panned out...
I'm not staying here.

473
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:27,030
No, we're going to Gillian's.
I'm not going to stupid Gillian's!

474
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,800
I'm going to yours with you.

475
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:31,560
It's...Lawrence...

476
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,800
Hates me, I'm boring.
No, you're not. Apparently.

477
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,600
Lawrence? You can't...!

478
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,120
You'll be on your mobile?

479
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,390
Hello! Hi.

480
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,270
Caroline.
Robbie.

481
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:22,350
They're off to York Races for t'day.

482
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:25,470
Hello! Awww...!

483
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:28,510
I'm Cheryl! How do you do?
I'm Robbie's better half!

484
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:31,720
Other half - what am I like?!
Don't tell me!

485
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,680
Ain't it a shame about t'weather?

486
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,870
I like your jacket -

487
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:40,230
I love the pattern,
it's really classy.

488
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,400
Bye, then!

489
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:45,470
I don't know how late we'll be.
No problem.

490
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,630
Loving you and leaving you.

491
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,910
Bye! Have a nice time!

492
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,470
That's the baby. That's Ellie.

493
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,390
Oh, my God! Oh!

494
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,920
You're a grandmother. Hm...

495
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:59,760
She's annoying.

496
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:06,470
Bloody York Races.
They've money to burn.

497
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:09,150
He's got homework.
She's got homework.

498
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:12,630
I thought -
weren't you and Robbie...?

499
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:16,400
No. Hell, no.
That went tits-up months ago.

500
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,310
Oh, I'm sorry.

501
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:21,790
Right, Batman. What's the plan?

502
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:24,310
Lunch. Somewhere nice.

503
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,670
To be honest...I'm a bit skint
this week.

504
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:29,990
Well, I'm not. I'm...I'm loaded.

505
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,560
I can't have you paying for me.
Yes, you can! Get your stuff.

506
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:37,830
Do I need to get dressed up?

507
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,040
Only if you want to.

508
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:43,470
Where we going? It's a surprise.

509
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:45,760
Whose car we going in?
I don't care!

510
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:23,230
I came here with Kate,
three months ago.

511
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:25,990
It was horrendous,
it was when we fell out.

512
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,550
It struck me as being a nice place
for a wedding.

513
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,750
I'm sorry you fell out.

514
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:35,790
Tell me about Muriel and your mum.
What's all that about, then?

515
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,430
It's a long story.

516
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,030
Well, it's an old story.

517
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:42,310
And it may be me reading
too much into things.

518
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,270
I mean, she's never actually
said anything.

519
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:46,800
You don't have to tell me, honestly.
I'm only being nosey.

520
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:51,760
My mum,
after they moved to Sheffield...

521
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,270
..after - presumably -
she'd given up on your dad

522
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,480
ever getting in touch...

523
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:00,200
..went out with this lad, Frank.

524
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,550
It was serious, apparently.

525
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,120
But then the upshot was...

526
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,310
..he ended up marrying Muriel.

527
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,270
No. No way!

528
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:12,630
Of course, my mum's version
is that she dumped him,

529
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,560
and THEN he took up
with their Muriel. But...

530
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:18,510
..why would she be so funny
about Muriel so many years on?

531
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:19,950
God.

532
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:24,310
All I know is...they'd had
a spat about something,

533
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,560
Muriel and my mum.

534
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:30,230
This is - God - years ago,
just after me and John got married.

535
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:33,310
And she was upset -
Muriel was -

536
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:35,150
so I popped round to see her,

537
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:38,040
to see if I could pour oil
on...whatever.

538
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:43,950
And she said, "What it is is,

539
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:46,680
"she's never really forgiven me
about Frank".

540
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:50,150
And stupidly, I didn't say,
"What do you mean?"

541
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:52,160
I think I just left.

542
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,110
Where is Frank?

543
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,840
Dead. Years ago.

544
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:03,270
Are you the two ladies enquiring
about wedding facilities? Yes!

545
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:05,830
Would you like to have a look
at the brochures, over lunch?

546
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:08,160
And then perhaps I can
show you around? Thank you.

547
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,480
Um...

548
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,790
I know you wouldn't mention it,
but just so you know...

549
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:30,550
Muriel never knew
about me and Kenneth.

550
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:33,310
About all the ups and downs we had

551
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:35,910
after I found out he'd been
mucking about behind my back.

552
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:39,750
OK. Like I say, I know you wouldn't,
but...

553
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,750
Not the sort of sister
you could confide in, then,

554
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,070
when it came to the crunch?

555
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:47,310
No. No...not our Muriel.

556
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:49,200
Well, who did you confide in?

557
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,440
Well, no-one.

558
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:54,870
Nobody. I didn't want folk knowing.

559
00:31:54,880 --> 00:32:00,790
I nearly told my mother, once,
when I was at a particularly low ebb.

560
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:03,950
But...it would have broken her heart.

561
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:06,710
And she'd have killed him.
She would have!

562
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:10,760
So, no. I dealt with it on my own.

563
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:14,950
Then I told Caroline, eventually,

564
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:17,040
when she was old enough
to understand.

565
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:21,110
And then...yeah.

566
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,280
You're the only other person
I ever told.

567
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,910
I've got a table booked
for this evening for seven.

568
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,150
It's just down here,

569
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:37,190
we've an Italian restaurant
just two streets away.

570
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,750
It's very nice, it's very good,
we're very lucky.

571
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,110
Do you like Italian, Alan?

572
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,390
Oh, I can eat anything!

573
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,790
And this afternoon,

574
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:46,470
Martin and Joanne said they'd pop in
with the girls.

575
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:49,230
How long is it since you've
seen the girls, Celia?

576
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:50,750
They've shot up!

577
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,630
Martin's my eldest.

578
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:55,230
Laura's just started the second year
of her A-levels,

579
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:57,150
she's doing very well.

580
00:32:57,160 --> 00:33:00,190
William's gone to Oxford.
How's he getting on?

581
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,070
Fine, as far as we know.

582
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,790
He's only been there a week...
Do you have grandchildren, Alan?

583
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,710
Just the one. Raphael. Raff.

584
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,950
He's just started the second year
of his A-levels as well,

585
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:12,350
same as your...? Laura. Laura.

586
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:15,310
You must be so proud of him,
William.

587
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:18,710
Well, I always think pride
comes before a fall, so...

588
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,830
Of course she's proud of him.

589
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:23,150
I'm proud of him,
he's not even my lad!

590
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:25,470
Aw!
What does your daughter do, Alan?

591
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:28,990
She farms. She's a farmer.
She farms sheep.

592
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,510
Oh! Of all the things you might've
said, and I'd been guessing,

593
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:34,230
that would not have been
one of them!

594
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,990
Is it a special variety, breed?

595
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,030
No, no - just your bog-standard
Swaledales.

596
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:42,670
Fascinating. It can be.

597
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:45,080
Lambing! Oh, yes!

598
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:53,030
Tell me about Caroline.
What about her? Her and John.

599
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,390
Oh, well.

600
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:57,630
He, er...started messing about
with somebody else.

601
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:00,590
No...no! He's an idiot.

602
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,270
John? Well, yeah.

603
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,470
I am sorry.

604
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:05,950
It was about a year ago. 18 months.

605
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:08,590
Course, he came crawling back -
when was it?

606
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,070
Three or four months since.

607
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:13,310
Realising what a fool he'd been.
But... But she'd moved on.

608
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,790
Well, she realised she didn't
need him any more.

609
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:18,310
Good for her. I think so.
Good for her.

610
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,400
Absolutely. Absolutely.

611
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,990
Well, I'm going to make another
pot of tea, Alan, if...?

612
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,950
Smashing, yes. Thank you.

613
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:30,360
We should go into the garden.
It's such a lovely day!

614
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:34,390
Oh, I don't know how much more
of this I can stand.

615
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,750
What?

616
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,470
Who does she think she is?

617
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,910
"And what do you do,
you little person?"

618
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,990
She seems right enough.

619
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,950
Why do folk ask a question,

620
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:46,670
and then interrupt as soon as you
embark on an answer?

621
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:49,550
She's just thrilled to see you,
she's just...

622
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:51,430
"Our Martin, our Laura."

623
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:54,720
She wants to put a sock in it,
she never stops.

624
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:58,920
Do not tell her about Caroline.

625
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:03,560
Instead of tea, can I tempt anyone
to a gin and tonic?

626
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,630
She'd love this. So would he.

627
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:12,750
Can we talk about costs?
Packages, deals, numbers?

628
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:15,790
Of course! Can I offer you ladies
a glass of champagne?

629
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:20,070
Um...yes. Thank you. Do you want
to join me in The Waterhouse Bar,

630
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,160
when you're ready?

631
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:26,510
If I drink too much,
can you drive my Land Rover?

632
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:28,120
What if I drink too much?

633
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,120
We'll be up shit creek.

634
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,070
I'm going out.

635
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:52,510
Is this too loud?

636
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:55,710
No! No. It's me. It's fine.
We can turn it down.

637
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:59,310
It's fine.
It's just...I can't concentrate.

638
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,670
Where are you going?
Just for a walk.

639
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,830
Shall we all go? No.
We can all go.

640
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,720
I just...no. No, you...

641
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:12,030
Perhaps you could get something
for supper...while you're out.

642
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:14,070
Pizzas or...? Yeah.

643
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,550
How long will you be?

644
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:16,830
I don't know, does it matter?

645
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,080
Have you got your mobile?

646
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,830
Isn't she too old to be pregnant?

647
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:31,270
Well...no.

648
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,230
Is she all right?

649
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:35,160
I... It's...

650
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,590
Why did you ask her
if she'd got her mobile?

651
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,350
Oh, she can't...

652
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:43,160
She doesn't... She sometimes...
What?

653
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,360
I'll just follow her.

654
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:50,710
I'll just make sure she doesn't...

655
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:53,870
She shouldn't really be drinking,
you see. Right.

656
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:56,760
Shan't be long. Famous last words.

657
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:11,110
Harry Wallace! Good Lord.
He once asked me out.

658
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:13,070
Oh, Harry asked everyone out.

659
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:16,030
Oh, I'm sorry, not that...
No, no, I know he did!

660
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:17,950
I didn't say yes!

661
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,910
Did he ever ask you out, Celia?

662
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,990
He wouldn't dare.

663
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,560
We're related now, me and Harry.
How?

664
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:29,750
Oh, well -
did you not...tell Muriel...?

665
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,040
Er, no. I hadn't.

666
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:36,670
Well, I've got a great-grandchild.
Emily. Emily Jane.

667
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:39,950
His - Harry's - granddaughter
and my grandson, Raff.

668
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,150
They've...

669
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:43,950
I thought...did you not say
he was still doing his A-levels?

670
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:48,190
Yes! They're very young.
They're both still at school?

671
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:51,510
Mm. Oh. Well...it happens.

672
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:54,990
They're very fond of each other.
Of course. And they're not daft.

673
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,070
Well...they were, obviously,
or it wouldn't have happened, but...

674
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,630
So they've risen to the occasion.

675
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:03,710
Yes! Yes, they seem to be doing.

676
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:05,000
Gosh.

677
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:12,630
Do you think Caroline'll ever
get married again, Celia?

678
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,310
Is there anyone?

679
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,030
Well, she's very attractive...

680
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:18,390
I doubt it.
I think she's seen the light.

681
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,550
Seen the light? As regards men.

682
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:25,630
I think she's worked out what
shallow-minded half-wits they are.

683
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:27,910
Oh, not you!

684
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:30,270
Not you, never you.

685
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:33,160
Aw, so wonderful. It's so perfect.

686
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:37,030
What a shame it didn't happen
all those years ago.

687
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,760
Yeah. Yeah.

688
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,840
In oh-so many ways.

689
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:46,590
Although we wouldn't have had
our Caroline and our Gillian.

690
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,670
Hello, love! (It's Caroline.)

691
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,990
Mum, this place we're visiting
is perfect.

692
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,270
I think you'll love it -
there are various options,

693
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:02,390
it depends how far
you want to push the boat out,

694
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,390
but honestly,
I think you'll be charmed.

695
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,310
But the point is the only day
they've got free

696
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:09,510
this side of Christmas,
and it's a way off,

697
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:12,550
is Tuesday the 24th of December,
so...

698
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,550
But that...that's Christmas Eve!

699
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,870
'I know it's Christmas Eve!'

700
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:18,270
So we need to make a decision,
because it'll probably go,

701
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,600
they're very popular.

702
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,310
(I think they think
we're getting married.)

703
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:26,830
Can you e-mail me some pictures,
to Muriel's address,

704
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,150
so we can have a look?

705
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,200
Just hang on, Mum.

706
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:33,150
W-Why would they think that?

707
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:37,510
I'm guessing that they remember
you bringing Kate here,

708
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:42,710
and they think that I'm just
another one of your women.

709
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,950
No! 'Hello?'

710
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,520
Are you there? Caroline?

711
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:51,950
Hello? Sorry.

712
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:54,430
Can you e-mail me some pictures?

713
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,750
Yeah, I can.

714
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:59,670
I've...got Muriel's e-mail
address on my phone.

715
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,270
What are you laughing at?

716
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:05,200
Nothing. We've just had
some champagne, that's all.

717
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:09,590
Oh, don't do that! Why not?
It's frightening. Oh, thanks.

718
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,590
My pelvic floor isn't what it was.

719
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:13,910
I'm going to finish wi' you
if you're not careful.

720
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,480
I can't hear what you're saying.

721
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:21,350
I'm going to send you some photos
and a list of costs, Mum. 'OK.'

722
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,990
Are you having a nice time?

723
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,790
No.

724
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:28,150
I'm sorry I rang her,
I'm sorry I put my foot in it.

725
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,550
It's fine, it's forgotten.
You didn't know.

726
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,510
I love you.

727
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:33,790
Aww!

728
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,830
'I love you.' Bye.

729
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,550
Bye.

730
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:38,840
Bye-bye.

731
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,840
How are we doing, ladies?

732
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:08,350
That's fantastic.

733
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:11,230
Thank you very much, we will.

734
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:14,880
Bye. Bye. Bye-bye.

735
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:19,670
Have they got it? Yeah.

736
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:22,910
"Inebriated headmistress
leaves phone in hotel bar."

737
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:25,470
"Drunken pillock
leaves phone in hotel bar."

738
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:28,600
That's not good copy,
that's just normal. 60.

739
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,120
Quick, open up, I need the loo.

740
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:41,480
Oh, I never lock up.
Nowt worth stealing.

741
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:50,750
'Hello. This is Caroline.

742
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:53,200
'Leave a message and I'll get back
to you as quickly as I can.

743
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,590
Mum? Dad went out. Ages ago.

744
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:00,910
I can't get hold of him.

745
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:02,680
Can you come and get me?

746
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:08,480
Where are you?
Why aren't you answering?

747
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:14,960
I'm sorry I said you were boring.

748
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:19,520
Mum?

749
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:22,720
Mum?

750
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:30,590
Tea. Mm.

751
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:32,510
You definitely all right
for driving me back

752
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:33,870
to pick up the Landy tomorrow?

753
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:36,030
Well, yeah,
I've got to get my phone, haven't I?

754
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:37,160
Oh.

755
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,320
What happened?

756
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:52,120
With Kate?

757
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:59,350
I booked two separate rooms
for a romantic weekend.

758
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:00,920
You knob.

759
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,120
Don't go on at me.

760
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:11,750
What time will thingy and whats-it
be back from...wherever-it-was

761
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,000
with little doo-dah?

762
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:18,880
Raff. Ellie. York. Calamity.

763
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:22,720
I've no idea.

764
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:27,070
Will you have room for me?

765
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:30,280
We've always got room for you.

766
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:37,800
I blew it with Kate.

767
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:42,120
I really blew it.

768
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:48,480
I only realise now
how lovely it was.

769
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:51,400
How precious.

770
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:58,080
And I've tried to apologise,
but she won't listen.

771
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:02,000
I think she's decided
that I'm bad for her.

772
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:07,240
And there's nothing I can do or say.

773
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:12,800
I'm in this box now,
with "bad" written on it.

774
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:19,120
Well, not "bad." Just...

775
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:23,920
"Arrogant."

776
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:27,000
"Inept."

777
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:30,560
"Selfish."

778
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:33,880
"Repressed."

779
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:40,080
Just, emotionally...crippled.

780
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:45,560
You all right?

781
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:53,720
What about you and Robbie?

782
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:58,080
Oh - me and Robbie.

783
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:03,160
That's a different sort of thing
altogether.

784
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:06,680
Why?

785
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:20,840
Do you fancy a drop of brandy
in your tea?

786
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:23,840
Are you?

787
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:35,910
Oh, I hope we've made
the right decision.

788
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:38,150
I think it looks spot-on.

789
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:41,510
One thing I will say for Caroline -
she has good taste.

790
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:44,830
Well, we're committed now,
they've paid the deposit.

791
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:47,680
Although she sounded a bit pissed
when I spoke to her.

792
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:52,870
Is this...Kenneth? Yeah.

793
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:54,200
That's him.

794
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:56,480
Hm...

795
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:00,590
She seems very fond of you, Muriel.

796
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:02,270
Considering...

797
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:03,790
Considering what?

798
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:07,430
Well, that...you don't seem
very fond of her.

799
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:09,840
Oh...she's right enough.

800
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:13,200
It's...
What?

801
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:20,350
Oh...she's always has to be
the centre of attention.

802
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:24,990
She can't just come to a party,
Muriel - she has to BE the party.

803
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,710
Well, some people are needy
that way, aren't they?

804
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:30,750
Needy? Is that what it is?

805
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:34,750
Scared of being left out.
Scared of being overlooked.

806
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:38,840
So they push their way to the front,
with their sharp elbows.

807
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:42,350
Some people might find
that attractive,

808
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:43,840
but I'm damned certain I don't.

809
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:48,510
Is that what you're bothered about?

810
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:49,950
If she came to t'wedding,

811
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:53,200
she'd make you feel like it were
her big day, rather than yours?

812
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:57,160
Something like that, yes.

813
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:03,520
She's very plain, you know.

814
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:06,000
Compared to you.

815
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:10,830
And she hasn't made me laugh
all day. Not once.

816
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:16,070
I think the day we get married,
you and me together,

817
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:19,320
we'll eclipse everyone else
entirely - don't you?

818
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:23,320
Was that her husband?

819
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:28,280
Yeah. Frank. That's Frank.

820
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:31,960
He's dead.

821
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:40,800
So here's the thing.

822
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:43,760
This is the thing.

823
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:49,560
Me and Robbie.

824
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:56,560
I am - I've always been -
very, very, very fond of him.

825
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:02,070
I should've stuck with him.

826
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:03,320
Robbie.

827
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:09,270
But Eddie...

828
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:13,680
He was...

829
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:17,800
..just one of those men who...

830
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:20,080
Oh, God.

831
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:26,590
When I was with him,
nothing else mattered. Nothing.

832
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:28,950
You could've dropped
a helium bomb on Halifax

833
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:30,600
and I wouldn't have noticed.

834
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:33,600
It was hydrogen.

835
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:42,440
I shouldn't have done that to Robbie.

836
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:47,720
But I couldn't help it.

837
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:52,590
I couldn't.

838
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:55,630
But you'd got over that, surely,
before -

839
00:48:55,640 --> 00:49:00,310
you and Robbie, when you started
going out with each other again...

840
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:01,640
Mm, yeah. We did.

841
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:04,950
Wow.

842
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:06,280
But...

843
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:10,950
It's not going to last
with that Cheryl, is it?

844
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:12,310
He'll soon get to the end of her.

845
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:15,270
He's obviously only bothering...
Yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever.

846
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:18,070
I know that. I know that.

847
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:19,400
Sorry.

848
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:24,000
Although Raff reckons
she's moving in with him.

849
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:30,390
Am I missing the point?

850
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:33,400
No. No. No.

851
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:36,280
I...

852
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:44,200
..don't think...ever...

853
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:50,720
..me and Robbie could be a good idea.

854
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:57,240
Even though, all things being equal,
we could've been.

855
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:00,270
Why?

856
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:04,320
We could've been really nice
together.

857
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:07,920
Why do you think you can't be?

858
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:17,400
I did the...shittiest thing to him.

859
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:25,840
I never told anyone this, Caroline.

860
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:31,190
I'm...very drunk.
So am I.

861
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:33,310
Are you? Yeah. Really? Yeah.

862
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:36,040
As drunk as me?
I don't know, I'm pretty drunk.

863
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:39,110
Don't tell me something
you're going to regret.

864
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:41,680
I want to tell you. OK.

865
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:48,880
I...

866
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:55,920
I murdered him.

867
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:00,560
Eddie.

868
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:05,750
The only proper family
Robbie ever had.

869
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:07,360
And...fuck!

870
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:19,240
I murdered him.

871
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:29,390
You don't know what you're
talking about, you never did!

872
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:30,990
It's all so easy, isn't it?

873
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:35,070
It's all so cut and dried
and black and white,

874
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:38,190
that's why you've been so successful
all your life!

875
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:41,950
Because you've got all the bloody
answers to bloody everything!

876
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:43,190
Lawrence?

877
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:47,270
"Just get rid of it, Judith,
you're killing it, anyway."

878
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:49,870
Can you hear what you sound like?

879
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:52,230
Can you hear how nasty it is?

880
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:55,790
Lawrence?
You have no... Men don't!

881
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:59,350
Women create, men destroy. Fact.

882
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:03,750
Women create life, men shoot people.

883
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:07,150
Name me one war started by a woman.

884
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:08,350
The Falklands.

885
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:10,310
Yeah! Exactly! That's the one.

886
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:11,550
Where's Lawrence?

887
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:15,150
Out of how many? Since time began?

888
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:17,110
One war.
Where is Lawrence?

889
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:20,950
And don't say the Trojan War,
because that's bollocks.

890
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:25,070
Pollux. Pollux and Castor,
they started it.

891
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:27,830
They invaded...Athens.

892
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:32,030
She was - Helen was just an excuse
to get the guns out.

893
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:33,510
Boadicea.

894
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:35,830
Joan of Arc, Elizabeth I,

895
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:40,550
Cleopatra, Queen Anne, Golda Meir,

896
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:43,350
Indira Ghandi, Catherine the Great.

897
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:46,510
Queen Isabella of Spain -
she was a bitch.

898
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:47,550
Tzu-Hsi...

899
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:49,710
You made that last one up.

900
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:52,630
You don't know what you're
talking about! Let's face it.

901
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:55,200
Gun-boat diplomacy!
Who started that?

902
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:57,870
Queen Victoria!

903
00:52:57,880 --> 00:52:59,520
Where is Lawrence?

904
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:05,880
He knocked me about.

905
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:09,960
All the time.

906
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:16,200
He knocked three of my back teeth
out.

907
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:20,960
Be careful not to do it at the front.

908
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:24,040
Where people can see.

909
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:29,360
Once...he pinned me down...

910
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:32,280
..and put a cigarette out.

911
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:38,080
On my neck.

912
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:55,360
I've...shed blood...

913
00:53:57,160 --> 00:53:59,720
..in every room in this house.

914
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:14,200
There were other humiliations.

915
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:18,800
I won't bore you with them.

916
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:23,160
So...

917
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:33,440
I...

918
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:41,070
The police had me in for...days.

919
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:43,400
Hours, over several days.

920
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:48,080
And me dad.

921
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:55,080
I told him same tale I told them.

922
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:59,520
That I'd found him with his head
in the log splitter.

923
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,470
He had an inkling
there was more to it than that,

924
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:07,640
me dad did.

925
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:15,870
So I told him I'd put him
out of his misery

926
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:18,080
after a botched suicide effort.

927
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:25,830
He bought that.

928
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:28,360
I think - I think he bought that.

929
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:35,520
Then he made me ring the police.

930
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:44,160
Why are you telling me this?

931
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:48,440
I don't know.

932
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:54,960
Because...

933
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:58,040
..that's why it could never work.

934
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:00,200
Me and Robbie.

935
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:05,630
Even he -
after the coroner's report -

936
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:06,880
had to accept...

937
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:16,240
But I did it.

938
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:26,750
His brother,
only proper family he's ever had,

939
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:28,360
and I...

940
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:33,840
..did it.

941
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:39,160
So that's why.

942
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:42,600
That's why.

943
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:47,040
But other than that...

944
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:58,200
I don't know why I've told you,
Caroline.

945
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:31,310
Oh...

946
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:54,750
I need to know
if you're going to go to the police.

947
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:56,390
Do you fancy a stag night, Alan?

948
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:57,790
Like in a lap dancing club?

949
00:57:57,800 --> 00:58:01,150
I decided it was worth,
one more time, saying I'm sorry.

950
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:05,590
My only regret is that we didn't get
that bungalow at Ripponden Bank.

951
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:07,670
It were my fault we didn't get it.

952
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:11,270
Kate's driven herself into hospital.
She's bleeding.

953
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:15,070
I think you and our Gillian
should get back together.

954
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:18,750
Did you ever know how miserable
I was with Kenneth? No.

955
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:20,910
Hi? We're ready.
They're ready.

956
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:21,950
Have a nice Christmas.

957
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:23,400
Yeah, how likely is that?
