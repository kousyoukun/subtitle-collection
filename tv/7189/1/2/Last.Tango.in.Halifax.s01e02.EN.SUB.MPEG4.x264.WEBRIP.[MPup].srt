1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,080
This programme contains some strong language.

2
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:10,440
- I've got a new headship. 
- Where? 
- Huddersfield. 
- Went well? The move.

3
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,480
- Robbie? Shit! 
- Jesus! 
- Shit, Robbie!

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,160
- Oh, my God. 
- Dial 999 now. 
- He's still in there. Eddie.

5
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:19,240
Your house is haunted by none other than Matthew Normanton,

6
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,760
right-hand man to King David himself.

7
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,200
Nonetheless, it's... THUNDER RUMBLES

8
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,680
I know there's no such thing. But what if there is?

9
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:29,880
Celia's playing Madame Arcati in Blithe Spirit.

10
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:34,280
- We've no-one to play Dr Bradman. 
- Oh... 
- So I said you'd do it.

11
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,360
What have you got to lose?

12
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,640
John and Judith? Are you serious?

13
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,920
This is why I'm suggesting doing it at my house, rather than yours.

14
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,200
Greg wants to come and spend time with Flora,

15
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,640
so that's another reason to be at our house.

16
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,040
- What about... 
- HIGH-PITCHED: 
- ..Bridget?

17
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,520
- Well, Bridget... HIGH-PITCHED: 
- Bridget.

18
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,360
..will be with her parents in Chipping Norton.

19
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,960
Of course she will. Of course! That's where she comes from.

20
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,200
Yeah, so...

21
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,480
What do you think?

22
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:52,200
Yeah, let's do it at your house.

23
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,480
Brandy snaps!

24
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,920
Oh, my actual God. Do you remember brandy snaps?

25
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,520
I haven't had brandy snaps

26
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,480
since I was, like, six at my Auntie Mary's house.

27
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,880
You all right?

28
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,960
Caroline?

29
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,320
What's the matter?

30
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:14,160
This thing happened, and I haven't told anyone.

31
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,320
It's delicate.

32
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,840
OK.

33
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,640
Obviously, since Kate died, it can't have been easy for you.

34
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:29,840
How do you feel you've been coping with your responsibilities here?

35
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,720
- I'm sorry? 
- You have been an outstanding headteacher.

36
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,640
No-one here has anything but the highest regard for you.

37
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:41,040
However, the worry is that your performance has become...

38
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,160
"Lacklustre" is too strong a word.

39
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,320
Anyway, we - the governors and the parents -

40
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:54,760
wonder whether you would benefit from

41
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:58,400
some sort of...sabbatical.

42
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,360
- You're kidding! 
- And it became clear as the conversation went on...

43
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,120
..that this was a sabbatical

44
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,800
- I wasn't ever supposed to come back from. 
- Why?

45
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,680
We think we live in such a tolerant society, but...

46
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,800
- ..you scratch the surface... 
- No way.

47
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,480
Of course, nothing was said in so many words and I could have

48
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,400
made a fuss, but I was bereaved. There's the irony.

49
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,080
I was bereaved and I didn't feel up to it.

50
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,440
Talk about adding insult to injury.

51
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,000
And I didn't tell anyone

52
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,720
because it was a conversation I didn't want to have...

53
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,000
with anyone, certainly not with my mother or the boys,

54
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,520
and so I pretended it was a choice, a bold new adventure,

55
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,240
and now I'm terrified.

56
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:42,240
I'm terrified that I'm not going to last five minutes at this new place,

57
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,760
I'm terrified that they're going to eat me alive.

58
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,160
- No-one could eat you alive. 
- No, I know.

59
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,760
When you've got 101 tiny little irritations

60
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,560
chipping away at your self-esteem...

61
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,120
however strong you think you are...

62
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,240
and then you just make...

63
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:04,960
..just one or two rogue decisions...

64
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,360
..and suddenly, you find yourself

65
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:11,880
living in a strange house that everyone hates, and you're facing

66
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:16,000
a job you're worried you haven't got the stamina for...

67
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,880
- OK. 
- ..any more...

68
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,920
SHE CLEARS HER THROAT

69
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:23,600
Why did you go for such a difficult school?

70
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,920
Well, just after I had that conversation with Gavin,

71
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,480
that was when I met Olga.

72
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,520
Are you all right?

73
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:40,960
- Oh! I'm sorry! I'm sorry. I'm really... Oh, my God. 
- Oh!

74
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,760
That is a £45,000 car. HORN TOOTS

75
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:48,200
- Shit! Oh, God! Oh, no. 
- Are you all right?

76
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:52,080
I think so. I think so. Am I? Are you?

77
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,280
Weren't you looking?

78
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,320
I thought you were moving off. Were you not moving off?

79
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,000
There were things coming!

80
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,840
- Oh, this isn't happening. Oh, God. 
- HORNS BLARE

81
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:04,880
- Are you all right? 
- Pull over! 
- Yeah, whatever. Go round. You can see what's happening, can't you?

82
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,120
You've got eyes in your head. Wanker!

83
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,800
- MAN SHOUTS 
- You're a stupid arsehole as well.

84
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,840
Bring it on, moron!

85
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,160
- I am really sorry. 
- We need to exchange details.

86
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:19,840
- OK. 
- I'm just going to take some photos. 
- Good, good. Good idea.

87
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,640
I've just got to see if my daughter's all right.

88
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,080
She's not hurt, is she?

89
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,560
- No. 
- Oh, she's tiny! 
- She's fine.

90
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,280
SHE GASPS

91
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,560
Mummy's just going to be a few moments, Flora.

92
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,320
We've just had a silly little bump.

93
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:38,160
- You know, I don't know who I'm insured with. 
- You are insured?

94
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,680
I think I'm panicking.

95
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,800
If you just give me your name and a phone number.

96
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,360
HORNS TOOT

97
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:47,720
- OK, I'm just going to ring the police. 
- Why?! Why?

98
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:51,360
- Well, just because we're blocking the roundabout. 
- Have I gone pale?

99
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,480
Yeah, sit down, put your head between your knees. I'll...

100
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,520
I'll sort everything out.

101
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:59,240
You're taking this very well.

102
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:05,880
Yeah, I'm sorry I said that thing about the car costing so much.

103
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:09,680
I apologise, I'm sorry. It was unhelpful and unnecessary.

104
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,120
No, please, don't. I...

105
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,280
SHOUTING, HORNS BLARE

106
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,360
Tosser!

107
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,240
What is wrong with these people?

108
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,080
You really need to calm down.

109
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,360
I am calm!

110
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,800
I am not calm.

111
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,480
- I think I'm going to be sick. 
- Have you been drinking?

112
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,640
No, no! God, no.

113
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:30,760
I mean, don't get me wrong, I do drink, but...

114
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:33,240
- I can drink for England. 
- Look, look, OK.

115
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:36,680
I want to phone the police because I don't know what the procedure is

116
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:40,040
if you can't move your vehicle, and your van is dripping something.

117
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:43,600
Oh, no, that's just coolant. I don't think it's petrol.

118
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,400
It's something coming out of the radiator. It's probably water.

119
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,320
It's not petrol, it's just...

120
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,680
Oh, my God, it's petrol! Get the toddler out.

121
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,080
Get her out the car!

122
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,800
Right.

123
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,400
Have I spelt it properly?

124
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,680
Yeah.

125
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,160
- What's yours? 
- It's Mackenzie-Dawson.

126
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,560
Caroline.

127
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:13,280
And it's 07700 900 643.

128
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,520
Right.

129
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,240
So... Flora, she's your daughter?

130
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,520
Yes.

131
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,200
So, is she adopted?

132
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:29,760
- No. 
- Oh! 
- No. 
- OK.

133
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,520
Wow.

134
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,840
So...

135
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,120
- Oh, my partner gave birth to her. 
- Oh.

136
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,480
OK. Good.

137
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,840
Sorry.

138
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,920
For what?

139
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,560
Being inept, asking dumb questions.

140
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,680
No, you're direct. It's good.

141
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,840
Makes life easier.

142
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,600
So, what does your partner do?

143
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,360
Nothing.

144
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,080
She's dead.

145
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,920
So...so you ended up...

146
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:11,640
I ended up in bed with her, yeah. Which so isn't me.

147
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,240
I know. I know that.

148
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:16,680
I don't pick people up off street corners and end up in bed with them.

149
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,920
- Like I do? 
- No, I never... I didn't say that.

150
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,280
And that's not...

151
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,320
That's exactly what happened.

152
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,840
It was a few days later.

153
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,480
She just knocked on the door.

154
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,560
Hi.

155
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,680
Which was a nice gesture, which she didn't have to make,

156
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,360
so I invited her in.

157
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,560
And, erm, we had...we had...

158
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,680
Well, it was a Friday night, so we had some of the wine.

159
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,360
Maybe two bottles.

160
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,040
- I mean, it was good wine. 
- That's all that matters.

161
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,680
And, um...

162
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,040
Yeah... She... We...

163
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,960
One thing led to another.

164
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:56,960
I've got this thing that I need to tell you.

165
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,480
What?

166
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:03,920
- You know when I went into the back of you? I mean, on the road. 
- Yeah.

167
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,040
- I was texting. 
- Oh.

168
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,040
I just need to get that off my chest

169
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,760
because it really shouldn't have happened,

170
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,000
especially with Flora in the back and everything. So...

171
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,440
- I'm sorry. 
- It's OK.

172
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
- Really? 
- Yeah.

173
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,840
Yeah.

174
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:29,080
God, she's a stupid bitch.

175
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:33,720
- Sorry, who is? 
- Oh, my girlfriend.

176
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:36,920
That's who I was texting. She drives me up the wall.

177
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:39,000
Trust it to be her that I'm texting

178
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,040
when I smash into the back of a £90 million car.

179
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,200
Sorry...

180
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,600
You've just apologised to me because you were texting

181
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,000
and then you blithely go and mention to me that you've got a girlfriend?

182
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,040
Ex. Ex!

183
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:56,800
Did I not say ex? No, we split up.

184
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,360
When?

185
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,920
SHE SIGHS

186
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,360
Day before yesterday. She dumped me.

187
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,800
Why?

188
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,560
Because...

189
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,040
..she thought I'd been seeing someone.

190
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,560
And had you?

191
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,840
So obviously I'm someone she's just picked up on the rebound

192
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:23,120
from a shit-storm of entanglement.

193
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,120
So then I felt like I'd been unfaithful to Kate,

194
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,120
and if I was going to do something like that,

195
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,400
it should have meant more.

196
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,920
I should've been more discerning.

197
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:33,360
I should... Why am I telling you this?

198
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,440
Oh, yes, Olga is intelligent, cultured,

199
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:39,080
but entirely uneducated, her and her brother.

200
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,880
- Sod 'em! 
- Yeah, I know.

201
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,200
ROMANTIC MUSIC PLAYS

202
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,280
- You know what you should do? 
- What?

203
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,360
You should work in the state sector.

204
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,120
You're needed.

205
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,520
I had a really shit education.

206
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:55,560
You know, our dumb parents lurched from one bad enterprise to another,

207
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:58,640
which meant we never had any money, despite being posh.

208
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,520
So we ended up down the local comp.

209
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:03,680
That's where I learned to talk like this. I hated it!

210
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,920
Half the staff, they didn't know what they were talking about.

211
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,480
And the other half,

212
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,640
they were so overworked

213
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:14,160
and all so thoroughly demoralised.

214
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,120
God, they reeked of it. They stank of it.

215
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:21,920
Oh, and then this really crap, useless headteacher,

216
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,920
who never spoke to any of us

217
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:27,000
because he was too busy having a breakdown...

218
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,120
Go and work in a state school.

219
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,400
In a school in a poor area.

220
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:35,240
In a school that really needs someone like you.

221
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:38,120
You could make a real difference!

222
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,000
Can you imagine?

223
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,960
If kids in state schools had the kind of teachers

224
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:46,880
- that someone like you could attract... 
- Yes, it's... It's...

225
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,520
It's not that simple.

226
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:54,400
Of course it isn't. It takes a lot of people to make a real difference.

227
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:58,880
But where do you start, if it's not with someone like you?

228
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,440
Maybe this was meant to happen.

229
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,000
God, yeah!

230
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,640
No, Caroline!

231
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,760
Maybe...

232
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,280
..she's right.

233
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,800
Maybe this was meant to happen.

234
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,120
Don't tell anyone.

235
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:25,480
Men are worse than women, you know,

236
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:30,120
especially highly strung men, like your husband...

237
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,280
..is.

238
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:37,120
- Is he so highly strung, do you think? 
- Yes.

239
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,360
Erm...

240
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:42,720
I need to talk to you about that.

241
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,560
He's been working a bit too hard lately.

242
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,600
You do know you're paraphrasing?

243
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,880
Remorselessly, as Gerald would say.

244
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,160
Yeah, but I'm getting gist across.

245
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,720
You need to have more of a manner, Alan, you know?

246
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:00,280
These are sophisticated people.

247
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:04,360
They live in Kent, for goodness' sake. It's the 1940s.

248
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,080
I don't know...

249
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:11,360
I've driven through Kent, you know, once in the 1970s.

250
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,680
That's different.

251
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:15,520
And who are these people? I don't know who these people are.

252
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:19,000
They've got a maid, a cook that they treat like dirt.

253
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,320
Neither of them seem to go out to work.

254
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,360
Don't they know there's a war on?

255
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,400
- I mean, that's not even mentioned. 
- It's a comedy!

256
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:30,920
Get on board. Come on, let's keep going.

257
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:33,560
POSH VOICE: Is he so highly strung, do you think?

258
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:37,720
- POSH VOICE: 
- I'm afraid he's been working

259
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,960
a bit too hard lately.

260
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:42,600
NORMAL VOICE: Been OVERWORKING lately.

261
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,120
- POSH VOICE: 
- Been overworking lately.

262
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,720
"Overwarking"?

263
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,600
- NORMAL VOICE: 
- Oh...

264
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:54,160
Eh? Eh? Summat about in a nervous condition but nowt serious.

265
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,800
I think that's as far as I've got.

266
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:01,560
Right, well, that's the scene you're going to be rehearsing tonight.

267
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,760
Janice'll want you on top of your lines.

268
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,160
I'll be on top of my lines.

269
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,600
- I've said I'll do it. 
- Bye! 
- >

270
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,800
- And I'll do it properly. 
- The news is good.

271
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,880
Angus has passed his test and he's driving over on Christmas Day

272
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:14,160
- to get away from his mental parents. 
- Oh, yippee.

273
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,440
Well, you better tell Gillian or your mother,

274
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,240
whoever's doing the cooking.

275
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,920
- We've already got a full house. 
- Good. They won't notice one more.

276
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,440
We'll be off out in his jalopy as soon as he gets here.

277
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,640
Oh, that'll make your mother happy(!)

278
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:31,080
You and Angus the nitwit taking hairpin bends at breakneck speed

279
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,920
across the moors in a car with no brakes.

280
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,000
Oh, and he's bringing a ouija board.

281
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,080
We're going to speak to Matthew Normanton.

282
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,400
- Where did he get a ouija board from? 
- Amazon.

283
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,920
You can join in, if you want.

284
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,600
Like, method acting with this old bag woman

285
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,160
you're playing in this play.

286
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,120
Go on, then.

287
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,040
Grandad.

288
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,640
- No, you can't. 
- What's she wanting? 
- Grandad.

289
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:59,960
- She wants Robbie to carry her. 
- He can't, chicken. He's hurt his neck.

290
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:02,680
Strictly speaking, Grandma hurt his neck, but we won't dwell on it.

291
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,320
Never going to let it drop.

292
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,960
In the barn.

293
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:12,240
- Yes, that's right. 
- In the barn. 
- That's right. In the barn.

294
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,960
- She's not on about him again! 
- She loves him. 
- Who?

295
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:17,760
- The fellow in the barn. 
- What fellow in the barn?

296
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,880
- It's just this idea she's got. 
- Of a fellow in the barn?

297
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,480
- Just one of her imaginary friends. 
- What does he look like?

298
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:27,520
- What's he said to her? 
- Mum, it's a joke, it's pretend.

299
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:30,440
Yeah, but it's not a joke if she thinks he exists.

300
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:33,280
- Does he have a name? 
- Grandad.

301
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,800
Yeah, in her little pixie head he exists.

302
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:39,320
- Nowhere else. 
- So what has she said about him? 
- Nothing! 
- Ellie!

303
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:42,520
- She just makes up stories with him. 
- With him? 
- About him.

304
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:45,520
- What happens in these stories? 
- Nothing! It's nowt.

305
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,680
Are we going to Caroline's, or what?

306
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,960
- Yeah. Stop being weird, Mum. 
- Get in.

307
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,840
INDISTINCT CHATTER

308
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,880
- OK, are you ready? 
- Shh.

309
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:20,520
- Theresa May? 
- I don't know what you're doing. What are you doing?

310
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:24,120
- I know who it is. 
- They're hopeless! 
- It's obvious.

311
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,760
It's obvious to me who it is.

312
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,080
Ethelred the Unready.

313
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,400
Enid Blyton.

314
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:31,640
Erm... Oh, Michael McIntyre.

315
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,760
What's-her-name off The Magic Roundabout?

316
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,520
- You're just reeling off names now. 
- Well, it's one way.

317
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,160
Is it...

318
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:42,120
Oh, are you cooking something? You've baked a cake. Nigella Lawson.

319
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,640
- Jamie Oliver. Fanny Cradock. 
- Who?

320
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,720
It's got to be a name that's already been!

321
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,080
- Talking, you're talking. You're not allowed to talk, Celia. 
- Oh, Jesus.

322
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,840
Oh, yeah, him!

323
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:56,120
- So sad. 
- Minute's up. Stop. 
- ALL: 
- Aw...

324
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:58,600
They all get it. How come you can't?

325
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,680
Well, it would help if one-third of the women's team wasn't babies,

326
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,920
and the other third weren't outside having a fag,

327
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,680
or whatever it is they think they're doing.

328
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,320
- ALL: 
- Oo-oo-ooh!

329
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:12,840
I've got this thing I'd like to get off my chest.

330
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:13,880
OK.

331
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,360
The afterlife.

332
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:17,080
Oh, yeah.

333
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,880
Me dad told me about

334
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:24,120
him and your mum wanting to be buried together whenever...

335
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,800
Yes.

336
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,320
You knew?

337
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,880
Yeah.

338
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,240
- Yeah. 
- Well, I suppose it's different for you.

339
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,440
Your mum and dad never got on, did they?

340
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:43,520
So they might not want to be together for ever in eternity.

341
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,880
But it's...

342
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:48,160
It's bothered me about mine.

343
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:53,600
But then we now know he was unfaithful to her, so...

344
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,880
Maybe she wouldn't have wanted that anyway now, so...

345
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,480
Oh, I don't know.

346
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,520
Sorry, I should've told you.

347
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,040
So, when did you know?

348
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:10,400
When they altered their wills last summer.

349
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,800
I'm my mother's executor, so I had to sign something.

350
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:18,920
- May, June, around then. 
- You're an executor? 
- Yeah.

351
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,680
GEARS CRUNCH

352
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,680
TYRES SCREECH

353
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,320
Here he is!

354
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,560
- Better start the washing up. 
- Yeah.

355
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,920
Did you, erm, bring the stuff?

356
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,080
£9.99.

357
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:52,320
We're having a seance when it gets dark. Do you want to play...join in?

358
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,960
Yeah. Why not?

359
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:03,280
- Ah. 
- Hello. 
- Is there any more...

360
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:09,280
- I thought you'd come to help me with the washing up. 
- Oh, yeah. Can do.

361
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,000
Um...

362
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:17,080
- Why are you here? 
- To be with the boys.

363
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,680
No, really.

364
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,000
Oh...

365
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,280
You think this is me desperately needing to be with other people

366
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:28,440
on Christmas Day because I can't stand being on my own with her? No!

367
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,480
Not in the least.

368
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:34,440
Since she stopped drinking, well, some days it's touch and go,

369
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,840
but on the whole...

370
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:40,320
I think we're actually pretty well matched. She's great fun.

371
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,720
Very clever.

372
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,960
No, I often think, as I'm sure you do,

373
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:50,920
that things always tend to work out for the best...in the end.

374
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:55,160
One way and another.

375
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,520
Good.

376
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,320
Well, good.

377
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,400
Good.

378
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,280
I'm pleased for you.

379
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,640
TV ON IN THE BACKGROUND

380
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:41,800
You don't fancy doing this play instead of me, do you?

381
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:46,600
- Playing this Dr Bradman fellow? 
- Me? 
- Yeah. 
- I can't act

382
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:51,800
- any more than you can. 
- Well, I don't think that matters, as such.

383
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:55,800
- It's only am-dram. 
- Well, no, I don't fancy doing it.

384
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:58,360
I think I've bitten off more than I can chew.

385
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,840
Aye. Well, you shouldn't have been

386
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,880
so keen to say yes just to make some damn silly point, should you?

387
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,600
I didn't want Celia to be disappointed if it all fell through.

388
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,000
- You'll be all right. 
- I keep having nightmares.

389
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,320
We're standing in the wings and I'm in costume

390
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:21,880
and I'm just about to step on stage and, God knows why,

391
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,840
it's only then I realise

392
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:27,320
I've never actually sat down and learned the lines.

393
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,720
- None of them. 
- Ooh, shit.

394
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,360
I know.

395
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,880
I've had it three times now.

396
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,880
You only got the part two days ago.

397
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:38,560
Yeah, but I have naps.

398
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:44,320
Well, it's only a dream. It's probably normal.

399
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,760
I bet Laurence Olivier were the same.

400
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,880
- Go on. 
- What?

401
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:52,640
You do it. You'll be better than me.

402
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,320
- No. 
- Think about it.

403
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,920
No.

404
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:09,720
- Is there a gardener? 
- Eh? 
- In the play, is there a gardener?

405
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:14,120
No. Not that I know of.

406
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,920
Why?

407
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,560
I could be a gardener.

408
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:20,280
There isn't a gardener.

409
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,680
- I'd be a good gardener. 
- There isn't one.

410
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:25,320
- Well, happen there should be. 
- Well, there isn't.

411
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:28,360
- Well, happen somebody should write one in, then. 
- He's dead.

412
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,000
- Who is? 
- The fella that wrote it.

413
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,680
Noel.

414
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,120
Yeah, him.

415
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,680
I'd make a good gardener.

416
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:45,280
This doctor, happen he does a bit of gardening in his spare time.

417
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,880
Happen you could think of him more as a gardener than a doctor.

418
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,800
Bugger off. I'm not falling for that. A doctor's a doctor.

419
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:02,240
- I know what you should do. 
- What? 
- Play it for laughs.

420
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:06,200
Get a big set of false teeth, like that vicar Dick Emery used to do,

421
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:10,160
and talk like a silly arse. It would bring the house down. It will.

422
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:13,600
That's what you need. A gimmick. A thing.

423
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:17,680
You could do a limp, something like that. You could be a bit pissed.

424
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:22,640
Play him pissed. A pissed doctor. That'll get 'em going.

425
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,640
A pissed doctor that squints. Hey?

426
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,920
A limp, pissed, squint and...

427
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:31,080
stick your teeth out and talk like a silly arse.

428
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:33,640
They'll give you a Bafta for that!

429
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:38,520
You see, you've got more ideas than me! I think you're missing a trick.

430
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,520
HARRY GRUMBLES

431
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,320
- I don't... 
- What?

432
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,440
I don't think I can learn these lines.

433
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:50,640
Not in three days.

434
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,760
HE SIGHS

435
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:56,440
At one time, happen, but not now. And I have tried.

436
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,200
HE SIGHS

437
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,080
Well... I'll have a look.

438
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,560
Eee...

439
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:13,800
Well, everybody can't put their hand on the planchette

440
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,320
because there isn't room.

441
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,400
- I'm happy to just watch. Can you just watch? 
- Er, yeah.

442
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:20,720
I'm not sure this is something that you really want to be doing.

443
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,880
If you're going to have doubts about it, it won't work.

444
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,280
It says so on the instructions.

445
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:26,360
Yeah, shut up. Let's just get on with it, yeah?

446
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:29,280
- Right. I'll just watch. 
- Come on, we're losing momentum.

447
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,880
- Who's going to be in charge, then? Have we decided? 
- Granny.

448
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,960
It's good research for a play that she's in.

449
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:36,240
Good. Come on, Celia. You'll be good at this.

450
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,200
Right, come on, kids. Concentrate.

451
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,640
Shh.

452
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:50,080
Is there anybody there?

453
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,160
SNIGGERING

454
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:56,640
- Sorry. 
- You will have to leave the room. 
- Sorry.

455
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:59,280
Nerves. Sorry, Celia.

456
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,200
Is there anybody there?

457
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:08,800
- Oh, shit. 
- Did you feel that? 
- Keep your hands on.

458
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,800
Did you do that?

459
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,240
Shh.

460
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,760
- RAFF: 
- Was that real?

461
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,400
- Shh. 
- Was it? People better not be messing about.

462
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,480
Oh, come on. Concentrate.

463
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,560
Are you there?

464
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:25,840
Please indicate to us if you are there.

465
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,440
Is there anybody there?

466
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:33,120
- You're doing that. 
- I am not.

467
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:36,320
That's weird. That is weird. That's weird.

468
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:40,240
- Someone is with us. LAWRENCE: 
- Have you done this before, Granny? 
- No.

469
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:45,720
- Granny, are you moving it? 
- No, she isn't. 
- No.

470
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:51,840
Are you a spirit of the departed, passed over, from the other side?

471
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:57,240
- Celia, no, really. Is that you? 
- That's weird. 
- Put your hand back on.

472
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:59,160
I think it's weird.

473
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:02,960
Spirit...spell out your name for us.

474
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,560
Oh, my God.

475
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,160
S.

476
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,480

E.

481
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:26,520
- Spike? 
- Ooh, no. That's freaky, that.

482
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:29,680
We used to have a cat called Spike.

483
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:34,760
A black cat. He got chopped up in a combine in the lower field.

484
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:38,840
- Do you remember, Mum? 
- Yeah. Yeah, I remember it was me that k...

485
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:44,440
I'm not sure I want to do this any more.

486
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,960
SNORING

487
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,160
Shut up.

488
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,000
Shh.

489
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,160
SNORING CONTINUES

490
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,640
Shut up!

491
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,160
Robbie, shut up!

492
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,720
SNORING CONTINUES

493
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,560
Robbie.

494
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:23,640
Robbie. Robbie.

495
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,560
Robbie!

496
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,680
Robbie. ROBBIE!

497
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,440
HE GASPS

498
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,880
Stop snoring.

499
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,280
Sorry.

500
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:42,400
SNORING RESUMES F... hell!

501
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,520
DOOR SLAMS

502
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,640
- You all right? 
- Yeah. I can't sleep.

503
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,800
Why?

504
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:20,440
- Because you snore, Robbie. 
- Sorry.

505
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,280
- I can't... 
- What?

506
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,040
I can't do this any more.

507
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,120
What are you talking about?

508
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,480
This, us.

509
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,320
This, us - what?

510
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:38,960
SHE SIGHS

511
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:44,960
- Don't shout. 
- What do you mean, don't shout?

512
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:48,000
I don't want you to go busting your stitches by shouting.

513
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,880
Yeah, well, it's not at the top of my list of things to do, either.

514
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,560
I think...

515
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,280
Something weird's happening.

516
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,320
You what?

517
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:59,040
You won't like what I'm going to say

518
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:01,680
and you'll think I'm mental, which is fine.

519
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:06,120
Right. Well, you'd better spit it out, then.

520
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,400
I do care about you.

521
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,480
Good.

522
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,320
Which is why...

523
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,600
Why what?

524
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,800
Why I'm worried.

525
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,600
About what?

526
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,640
Eddie.

527
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,040
Eddie?

528
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,040
I...

529
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:51,960
I think he's in the barn. That's the third accident you've had in there.

530
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,680
I think he never left.

531
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:59,840
And he knows we've got married and he doesn't like it.

532
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,320
That's...

533
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:03,800
Daft, I know. I do know that.

534
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:11,920
I think it's easy to read too much into stuff.

535
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:17,200
Don't you ever feel odd in that barn?

536
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:21,200
Well, yeah... It's where he died.

537
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,520
Obviously it's going to feel odd, but...

538
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,320
No, no... SHE INHALES SHARPLY

539
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:27,640
That's just knowing someone...

540
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,600
..took their own life in there,

541
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,680
- that's all that is. 
- Yeah, but is it? 
- Yes!

542
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:35,200
There's no such thing as ghosts.

543
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,720
OK, I've had three accidents,

544
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,400
but accidents happen.

545
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:42,680
It isn't like there isn't a logical explanation for 'em all.

546
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,920
That log falling on your head wasn't logical.

547
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,800
Except I was stacking logs at the time.

548
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,840
You said it felt like someone lobbed it at you.

549
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:51,680
That was the first thing you said when you came through that door!

550
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,000
Right. Supposing...

551
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,760
even supposing that there was something like that,

552
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,800
which there isn't, what could you do about it?

553
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,480
We should never have got married.

554
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:07,440
- He doesn't like it. 
- Have you got any idea how mad that sounds?

555
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:11,720
I am actually...past caring if it sounds mad. He's in there.

556
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:13,520
I've known he was in there for years,

557
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:15,680
only I've convinced myself I was being stupid.

558
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:18,240
Gillian, he's not in there! He's dead!

559
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:22,200
He killed himself because he didn't want to be around any more.

560
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:25,200
- We should never have got married. 
- Oh, that's just...

561
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:29,160
It's you I'm thinking about. It's you that keeps getting hurt.

562
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:32,720
Except, next time, if he does kill you, guess who'll be in the frame?

563
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,280
Guess who your buddies at the cop shop will be down on

564
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:37,640
- like a ton of bricks? 
- Well, OK.

565
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,320
Well...

566
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:44,440
Why don't we sell up and start again somewhere else if you're that upset?

567
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:48,440
- Because he'd follow us. 
- Gillian...

568
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:51,200
Anyway, I'm not being chased out by him.

569
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:54,600
This was my farm, not his. I...I worked for it.

570
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,680
I'm not going to be bullied by him.

571
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,960
I had enough of that to put up with when he was alive.

572
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,720
No, you won't be chased out by him,

573
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:03,080
but you'll give up on our marriage because of him!

574
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:07,000
I shouldn't have married you. That's the point. You're his brother.

575
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,760
It was a wrong thing to do.

576
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:12,000
That's... It's superstitious! It's crap!

577
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,520
He's been in there for years, watching me,

578
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:17,560
but he's never done anything like this before.

579
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:20,520
I don't think it's helpful thinking about him like this.

580
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:23,480
I think we should let him rest in peace, for all his faults.

581
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:26,520
- I'd love to. 
- He's gone! He can't hurt you any more.

582
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:30,360
So, why is this happening?

583
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:33,560
You... You've chosen to connect two things.

584
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,600
It's all in here.

585
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,560
I want you to leave.

586
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:45,000
For your own good.

587
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,120
No. Gillian...think about it.

588
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:50,120
There's no evidence.

589
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:53,920
You're letting your imagination get the better of you.

590
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:56,960
- You're being silly. 
- Silly?

591
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,200
You think this is just silly?

592
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,160
I'm going mad, Robbie!

593
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:07,120
Did you know Caroline is an executor for her mother's will?

594
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,600
I don't get asked. Dad doesn't ask me.

595
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:13,440
- What's that got to do with anything? 
- Nothing. It's just...

596
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,760
She's doing my head in!

597
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,560
And of course I'd look small-minded if I say anything.

598
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,080
Look, I can see you're upset.

599
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:25,360
I can see that you believe it's real, this...business,

600
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,960
but from my point of view...

601
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,760
- ..I can't. 
- Right.

602
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:33,400
Well... Who's this fella that Calamity's been seeing, then?

603
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,960
She's a kiddie.

604
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:37,080
- It's imaginary. 
- Yeah, but is it?

605
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:43,640
Some people think children can see things we can't.

606
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:45,240
Gill!

607
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,720
You know... you're starting to sound...

608
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,680
I never thought of you as flaky, Gillian.

609
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,880
SHE GASPS

610
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,720
There's something I've never told you.

611
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,200
What?

612
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,320
SHE EXHALES

613
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,920
What?

614
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,560
You were right.

615
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:17,000
All those years ago, trying to get me arrested.

616
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,040
Not my dad. He knew nothing.

617
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,480
It was me.

618
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:27,280
It wasn't an accident, it wasn't suicide.

619
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:31,960
It was me. I saw an opportunity and I...I took it.

620
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:36,080
I was off my head at the time. I was off my head with the...

621
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:38,920
the turmoil of having to live with a mad, torturing bastard.

622
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,680
- You're just saying that. 
- I'm not.

623
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:44,200
- You didn't really do it. 
- No, I did. And...I think...

624
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:48,680
..I can't live...like this any more.

625
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:53,000
I did it because I couldn't stand it, but I did it. I...

626
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,640
Why are you saying this?

627
00:34:56,640 --> 00:35:00,720
- I can't be married to you, because I killed your brother. 
- You...

628
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:05,440
- Don't say that. Why would you even say that? 
- I need to tell the truth.

629
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:09,680
I could cope, just about, till we got married.

630
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:13,560
I shouldn't have done that. I shouldn't have done it to you.

631
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:18,640
- How did you kill him? 
- Oh... You know how I killed him. 
- Describe it to me.

632
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,600
Oh, fuck off!

633
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,800
Describe it to me!

634
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:26,240
He was playing with the log-splitter.

635
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,720
No helmet.

636
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,360
He didn't know I was there.

637
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:32,600
I came in behind him and I shoved his head in the way of the blade,

638
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:35,120
and it shattered his skull.

639
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:37,080
He was drunk, I was drunk.

640
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,800
No, you were just...

641
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:42,520
- You're trying to get rid of me. 
- I'm... No.

642
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,200
SHE EXHALES

643
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:50,080
I need...to face the consequences and get it done with.

644
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:53,480
- You want me to arrest you? 
- Yeah. I think you should.

645
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,160
Erm...make a phone call.

646
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,800
SHE MUMBLES

647
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,640
Do whatever you have to do.

648
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:01,680
- You're serious, aren't you? 
- I killed him and I got away with it.

649
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,200
Except I didn't.

650
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,880
I want some peace.

651
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:13,000
And I'll never have any peace until I deal with it.

652
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:21,120
I'd rather kill myself than carry on like this.

653
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,680
I'm going to get dressed.

654
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:33,160
I'm going to pack a few things...

655
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:35,240
and I think...

656
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,720
..I'm leaving.

657
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,840
- Morning. 
- Hi.

658
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,920
You all right?

659
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,960
Robbie's gone.

660
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:14,560
It's, erm, been brewing for a while, and now he's gone.

661
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:15,840
Where?

662
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,720
Why?

663
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,800
Like I say, it's...

664
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:27,520
- Are you all right? 
- Yeah. I don't know. No!

665
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:33,080
- Has something happened? 
- No. No.

666
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:35,720
I asked him to go and he went.

667
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,400
You asked him to go?

668
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:46,800
I'm fond of him. I've always been fond of him.

669
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:51,880
But we should never have got married.

670
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:54,360
I think we both know that now.

671
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,240
HE SIGHS

672
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,400
I'm sorry...

673
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:02,480
Have I shocked you? Are you upset?

674
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,480
Is he all right?

675
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:09,360
I don't know.

676
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:15,600
- Harry?! 
- Yeah... He'll be better than me. 
- He'll muck it up!

677
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:16,760
No, he won't.

678
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:21,600
- He'll do it daft. 
- He's got some very interesting ideas. 
- I bet!

679
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:24,560
I think he'll put his heart and soul into it.

680
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:28,520
- He doesn't look like a doctor. 
- Well, neither do I. 
- Yes, you do.

681
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:32,200
- You look distinguished. 
- So does he! 
- Does he buggery!

682
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:35,800
Anyway, what do doctors look like? They're just people.

683
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:38,120
They come in all...physiognomies.

684
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:40,800
- He's got a beard. 
- HE SIGHS

685
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:46,040
- Freud had a beard. 
- Yeah, and he was a pillock. Sex, sex, sex.

686
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:48,920
- He won't be a patch on you! 
- It's just...

687
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,960
HE SIGHS

688
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:54,320
It's not my thing, I've realised,

689
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:59,480
standing on a stage, everyone looking, expecting summat.

690
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:03,800
I... I'm sorry. I were only doing it to help you out.

691
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,640
And he'll be perfectly...

692
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:07,320
He'll be better than me.

693
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:09,440
Well, I don't think he will.

694
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:12,240
And I'm disappointed.

695
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:15,680
I'll be involved. I...could...

696
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:19,600
sell programmes at the door. I could do the bar.

697
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,360
Do they have a bar?

698
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:25,640
I think you should reserve judgment wi' Harry.

699
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:28,120
I think you might be pleasantly surprised.

700
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,480
I'm going to brush my teeth.

701
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,920
Right.

702
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:39,920
- I'm sick of Harry! 
- No, you're not. 
- Yes, I fucking am!

703
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:43,360
- Oh, Mum! 
- Well, if you can't say the F-word

704
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:46,400
when you're pissed off at my age, when can you say it?

705
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:50,320
Oh, she's not listening. She's not bothered.

706
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:53,240
Anyway, you like hearing your granny swear, don't you?

707
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:57,760
She finds it liberating and uplifting, don't you, chicken?

708
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,120
Ganny!

709
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,520
SHE CHUCKLES

710
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:03,600
- See? 
- Yeah, well, so do I, most of the time, however...

711
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:05,400
can you just button it?

712
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:08,720
Oh, you're so conventional-minded, you.

713
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:14,040
- What's up? 
- I think I put my foot in it yesterday with Gillian.

714
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:17,920
I mentioned the fact that I was an executor of your will,

715
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,840
and I didn't realise that she wasn't...

716
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:22,440
with her dad.

717
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:25,160
- So... 
- Oh, well, wouldn't worry.

718
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:28,720
You know, he's worried...

719
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,960
that he can't remember his lines.

720
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:34,240
I heard them talking last night, him and Harry.

721
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:38,600
He's been struggling to remember his lines, then having bad dreams.

722
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:43,080
He doesn't want to let you down, but perhaps he genuinely isn't up to it.

723
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:45,160
And he has a heart condition.

724
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:50,240
- What do you mean? You think his memory's not...? 
- He's 78! 
- So am I!

725
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,640
Well, are YOU going to be ready on time?

726
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:56,480
You've got a lot more lines than he has, and you've only got three days.

727
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,600
Oh, I'll be all right.

728
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:01,440
- SHE CHUCKLES 
- Oh, God knows.

729
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,360
But I mean, you can't let the side down

730
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,800
when you've said you'll do something, can you?

731
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:08,320
Well...I can't.

732
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:11,320
Have you been online? Got your tickets?

733
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:16,680
- You know we're nearly sold out? 
- Yes! Everybody's coming.

734
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:18,680
And I mean everybody.

735
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:21,320
John, Judith, Greg, Angus, you name it. They can't wait.

736
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:23,680
- What night are you coming? 
- First night!

737
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:26,920
- It's the only night that had any tickets left. 
- And Olga?

738
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:33,040
- Olga? 
- She said she wanted to come the other day. I like Olga.

739
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,720
Do you?

740
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,600
Why?

741
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:52,240
- Hiya. 
- Hi.

742
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:54,560
Can I get a cup of tea, please, love?

743
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:00,960
Thank you for coming.

744
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,080
How's your neck?

745
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:09,280
Fine.

746
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:11,280
- How are you? 
- Um...

747
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:14,320
God knows. I'm all over the place.

748
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:21,920
Are you still of the opinion...that that's the truth, what you told me?

749
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:24,000
I don't think anybody knew...

750
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:27,520
..what I was going through with him.

751
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,880
And I had a little kid to look after, as well.

752
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:35,080
If I hadn't...

753
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:39,320
..done it to him, he'd have done it to me one day.

754
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:41,040
One day it would've happened.

755
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:42,720
You know.

756
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,960
You know what he was like.

757
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:50,200
But maybe you don't know the extent of it.

758
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:56,800
Maybe you can imagine without me...

759
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,800
spelling it out.

760
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,880
Are you all right?

761
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,480
Sad.

762
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:13,720
I'm just sad.

763
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:15,400
Sad for him.

764
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:17,120
Sad for me.

765
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:22,160
So, what are we going to do?

766
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:26,960
Are you going to report me? Do you want me to hand myself in?

767
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:29,520
It wouldn't bring him back, would it?

768
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:33,720
But maybe there's only me would want him back.

769
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:36,360
I don't know.

770
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:40,800
I do know what he was like, that side of him.

771
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:43,520
I should have married you.

772
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:46,440
- Years ago. 
- Yeah. 
- But not him.

773
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:49,160
Yeah, but you didn't.

774
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:52,200
You were obsessed with him.

775
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:53,520
Yeah. Fucking idiot.

776
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:55,880
I'm sorry...

777
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:00,840
I think you're right, though. I don't, erm...

778
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:04,000
I can't stay there. Not now.

779
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:08,320
I think that would be, erm...

780
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:13,360
- Have you told anyone else? 
- No. No, I...

781
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:18,560
My dad really didn't know. The worst thing he knew was that I didn't...

782
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:21,760
call for an ambulance as soon as I should have done.

783
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:24,600
And that did his head in.

784
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:30,760
I'm not going to do owt rash, but I had an offer on the house.

785
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:32,360
Remember?

786
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:36,800
Months ago. A cheeky offer, way below the asking price.

787
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:39,000
They said if I changed my mind, then...

788
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,240
So if they're still offering...

789
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:43,400
I might take it.

790
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:47,480
Then I think I might travel.

791
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:49,720
I've always fancied Canada.

792
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:52,960
You mean, like...permanently?

793
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:56,680
Maybe.

794
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:58,120
Right.

795
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:03,000
So we're not going to the police station?

796
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:06,720
No.

797
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:19,400
Excuse me. Thank you.

798
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:23,080
Hello...darling!

799
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:25,720
Are you pi...

800
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:27,480
(Pixelated?)

801
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:31,360
I may have had the odd sherbet or two, just to...

802
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:33,400
steady the old nerves.

803
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:35,040
It's packed!

804
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:37,280
Gillian isn't here, and Olga hasn't turned up,

805
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:40,280
but everybody else is here and they're all excited!

806
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:43,040
- He's pickled! 
- I love you, Alan.

807
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:45,400
I knew this would happen, or something like it.

808
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:49,520
This is, lest we forget, the fella that capsized a 75ft narrow boat

809
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:52,760
and damaged a small enclave of West Yorkshire!

810
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:57,080
- That's cheap, bringing that up. 
- How much have you had?

811
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:59,760
Don't worry, it's method.

812
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:05,120
I've, erm, decided the good doctor is indeed an alcoholic.

813
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:08,240
- But he isn't! It's not in the script! 
- You're joking!

814
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:10,960
They knocked back dry martinis for breakfast, this lot!

815
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:12,920
- Have you not read... 
- BELL RINGS

816
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:14,360
Has she not read...

817
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:16,240
We're on!

818
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:19,160
- We're on, everyone! 
- Get off me hat!

819
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:22,880
HARRY MUTTERS

820
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:39,120
- That's right, Edith. 
- Yes, ma'am.

821
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:41,720
Now, you'd better fetch me the ice bucket.

822
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:45,960
- Shh! 
- Did you get my white wine? I wanted a white wine.

823
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:47,800
Edith, as you're not in the Navy,

824
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:51,160
it is unnecessary to do everything at the double.

825
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:52,960
LAUGHTER

826
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:07,920
Olga?

827
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:11,520
- Yeah? 
- Gillian. I'm, erm, a friend of Caroline.

828
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:14,360
- Oh. 
- Her mum married my dad.

829
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:17,080
Ah, sweet! Are we late?

830
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:23,120
Sorry, ladies, the curtain's just gone up.

831
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:25,520
I can sneak you in if you don't mind waiting for a lull.

832
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:27,400
- Take your time. 
- Yeah, whenever.

833
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:30,440
- < 
- With your help, my love, I have risen above...

834
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:35,680
- I hate am-dram. 
- Me too. 
- I'm only here cos... Well, you know.

835
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:38,000
Yeah. Yeah.

836
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,400
Hey, fancy a drink?

837
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:51,280
- Oh...come... 
- Susan! 
- Oh, my love!

838
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:53,160
Oh, ignore him, Susan.

839
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:55,680
- Do your best, love. 
- Just refer to the script.

840
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:58,080
Everybody knows you've stepped in at the last minute.

841
00:47:58,080 --> 00:48:00,920
- Nobody will think anything of it. 
- I'm word perfect.

842
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:04,400
THEY ALL GASP

843
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:06,200
Jesus!

844
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:08,280
- Oh, dear! 
- Oh, no! 
- Let's have a look.

845
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:09,760
Susan's a midwife!

846
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:13,880
OK, Harry, listen to me. Listen to me, love. You're not going on stage.

847
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:16,080
Ring 999. He's broken something.

848
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:19,520
It's all right, you're all right. You're going to be absolutely fine.

849
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:24,160
I just need you to stay still. That's right, you squeeze my hand.

850
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:25,920
- Ohhh! 
- That's it. 
- What is it?

851
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:27,920
We've got a compound fracture.

852
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:32,360
- Oh... You'll have to go on, Alan. 
- Eh? Eh? 
- He can't!

853
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:37,160
- You'll have to talk to them. 
- Look, Alan will go on, with Susan. 
- Really?

854
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:40,680
We'll stay here with Nitwit until the ambulance arrives.

855
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:44,440
- Look, I... I... I...! 
- Harry, where's your script? 
- Oh, it's, erm...

856
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:45,840
Can you see it?

857
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:52,560
Alan, just read the lines. Just... Honestly, Alan, you'll be wonderful!

858
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:57,000
I... I... You've got to stop the show now. Surely. Surely...

859
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
Are you a man or a mouse?

860
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:02,840
Go on, get up on the stage, be the mouse that roared.

861
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:06,640
Cry havoc! For England and...Boy George... What's that quotation?

862
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:08,160
Come on, Susan.

863
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:12,560
She's probably on one knee in a pre-sprinting position,

864
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:15,120
waiting for Cook to open the kitchen door.

865
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:16,840
LAUGHTER

866
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:19,800
- Steady, Edith! 
- Yes, sir.

867
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:22,520
Dr and Mrs Bradman.

868
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:29,640
We're not late, are we?

869
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:36,920
I-I only got back from hospital half an hour ago.

870
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:39,240
No, no, of course not!

871
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:41,080
Madame Arcati hasn't arrived yet.

872
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:44,160
That must have been her we passed coming down the hill.

873
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:47,320
- I said I thought it was. 
- Then she won't be long.

874
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:51,400
- I'm so glad you were able to come. 
- We've been looking forward to it.

875
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:53,160
I'm really quite excited.

876
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:58,040
Oh...

877
00:49:58,040 --> 00:49:59,440
Erm...

878
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:03,600
I guarantee...Violet will be good.

879
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:10,320
- I made her promise. 
- There wasn't any need! I'm absolutely thrilled!

880
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:13,880
I've only seen Madame Arcati two or three times in the village.

881
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:16,880
I mean, I've never seen her do anything peculiar at all,

882
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:18,840
if you know what I mean!

883
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:20,800
Dry martini?

884
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:23,880
POSH VOICE: By all means! LAUGHTER

885
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:26,120
I'm all for it.

886
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:29,360
I mean, I assume she's very good at what she does.

887
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:33,280
And why should all the private schools

888
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:35,600
get all the superstar head teachers?

889
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:40,200
It weren't just me, you know? I mean, it wasn't just what I said.

890
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:43,960
In fact, it probably wasn't me at all. There was this lad.

891
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:47,680
- What lad? 
- Wyatt.

892
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:51,520
- A lad she visits in the Young Offenders'. 
- Who?

893
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:55,840
He's the boy that was driving the car when Kate got killed.

894
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:59,480
He wrote to her saying he was sorry and would she visit him.

895
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:02,640
So she did. Has she not told you this?

896
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:07,280
- No. 
- He's 16.

897
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:10,920
He was terrified of her first time, he was shaking.

898
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:16,440
But he was desperate to say sorry to her. To her face. And it shook her.

899
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:21,200
Made her remember there are other reasons for being in teaching,

900
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:24,360
besides helping rich kids with sharp-elbowed parents

901
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:26,000
get into Oxbridge.

902
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:30,800
- I didn't know that. 
- Mm.

903
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:33,760
You should remind her.

904
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:35,240
About that.

905
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:40,280
She's thinking she's made a massive mistake coming here.

906
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:42,680
SIREN WAILS

907
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:57,880
- Ohh! 
- Try not to make a noise. 
- Who is it? 
- This way.

908
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:07,240
Ooh, Daphne, don't do that, dear. You're hurting me!

909
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:09,840
Oh, Daphne, dear, please!

910
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:12,960
Ooh! Ooh!

911
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:15,080
Ooh! No.

912
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:17,360
Be good, there's a dear child.

913
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:19,880
LAUGHTER

914
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:24,680
You say there is someone there who wishes to speak to someone here?

915
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:26,240
SINGLE KNOCK

916
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:27,480
Is it I?

917
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:29,760
TWO KNOCKS

918
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:32,960
Is it Dr Bradman?

919
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:34,680
TWO KNOCKS

920
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:36,680
Is it Mrs Condomine?

921
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:38,600
CONTINUOUS KNOCKING

922
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:41,640
Oh, stop it! Stop it! Stop!

923
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:44,560
She's actually quite good.

924
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:46,560
Ohhh...

925
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:49,360
- Oh, steady on! 
- Harry?

926
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:52,680
- What happened? 
- Oh... 
- Shouldn't you be on stage?

927
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:56,200
- Your dad's doing it. Oh, careful! 
- Come on. 
- Oh!

928
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:57,880
Oh...

929
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:05,200
Oh! What are you doing?!

930
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:07,080
Sorry, we have to go in now.

931
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:09,040
Sorry.

932
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:11,080
CHEERING

933
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:13,120
WHISTLING

934
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:25,080
Well done!

935
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:26,120
Yeah!

936
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:31,120
Aw! So sweet, old people!

937
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:33,280
Yay!

938
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:35,480
- Whoo! 
- Don't!

939
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:38,600
Gillian said you're worried you're making a mistake being here,

940
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:40,320
with the school.

941
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:44,680
You haven't. You're going to make a massive difference.

942
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:47,600
You are going to be brilliant.

943
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:21,240
CHILDREN CHATTER

944
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:34,080
Good morning.

945
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:42,400
- Morning. 
- Good morning. How are you?

946
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:49,480
Morning.

947
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:58,480
- BELL RINGS 
- Good morning.

948
00:54:58,480 --> 00:54:59,960
- Morning! 
- Good morning!

949
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:10,920
Good morning! Has everyone had a good holiday?

950
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:14,080
Well rested? Delighted to be back, all raring to go?

951
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:18,800
- Do you want a doughnut? 
- Maybe later. Who's done this?

952
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:22,160
- Maintenance. 
- Can you ask maintenance to come back with a spirit level?

953
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:25,040
- He won't like that. 
- Shall we risk it?

954
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:31,120
Who do you fancy next? King Lear?

955
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:34,240
- No! 
- Eh, I could do Lady Bracknell.

956
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:36,160
Properly this time.

957
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:37,840
"A handbag!"

958
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:39,440
Is she in King Lear?

959
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:41,800
Yeah, she's one of the Ugly Sisters.

960
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:43,640
Oh! Very good.

961
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:45,480
Her and Gonorrhoea.

962
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:48,120
No wonder he didn't like 'em, wi' names like that!

963
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:49,760
SHE CHUCKLES

964
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:52,720
- Well, he chose 'em, presumably. 
- Aye!

965
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:55,000
Him and Mrs Lear.

966
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:58,120
He'd be hard work, wouldn't he? Miserable old sod.

967
00:55:58,120 --> 00:56:01,960
No wonder they were buggers to him. What about a musical?

968
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:04,240
A musical King Lear?

969
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:06,800
No! That would be dozy.

970
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:08,400
Come on, what's a really good play

971
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:11,240
for two mature individuals such as ourselves?

972
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:14,800
I don't know! I don't know owt about drama.

973
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:18,240
I don't know how we've gotten ourselves into this fine mess

974
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:21,280
- in the first place. 
- I think we must turn to the Bard.

975
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:25,160
- Must we? 
- Mm, whether we like it or not.

976
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:31,360
- Antony And Cleopatra! 
- Really? Which one are you going to play?

977
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:34,560
"I'll spurn thine eyes, like balls before me."

978
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:37,920
Oh! OK. Good luck with that one.

979
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:41,320
No! Where's your joie de vivre?

980
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:45,320
Well, I suppose you were the Queen of Sheba when we got wed.

981
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:49,120
- You might as well be Cleopatra as well. 
- Yeah.

982
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:55,080
And you're going to be my Mark Antony, Alan Buttershaw.

983
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:57,360
- You think? 
- Mm, yeah.

984
00:56:57,360 --> 00:57:00,440
Your legs can bestride the ocean.

985
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:01,960
HE CHORTLES

986
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:05,960
And I don't want to hear any excuses about arthritis.
