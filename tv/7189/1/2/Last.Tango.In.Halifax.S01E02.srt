1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,179
我有一个笔友，威廉告诉你了吗?不。
I've got a pen pal. Did William tell you? No.

2
00:00:04,206 --> 00:00:05,885
我的同学。
This fellow I was at school with.

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:08,399
我确实约过她一次。
I did ask her out once.

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,519
是的。
Yeah.

5
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:13,599
原来朱蒂丝有点酗酒。你想回来吗?
It turns out Judith's a bit of an alcoholic. You want to come back?

6
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,799
你该庆幸我让你跟他扯上关系了!
You're lucky I let you have owt to do with him!

7
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:18,399
你很幸运，他没有离开你。
You're lucky that you've not had him taken off you.

8
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,439
"我很高兴星期一能在斯基普顿见到你。"
'I would be delighted to meet you in Skipton on Monday.'

9
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:25,559
我想我可以请你喝几瓶啤酒。再一次。
I thought I might buy you a few beers. Again.

10
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:29,919
告诉我我爸什么时候去世的。这不是意外。她杀了他。
Tell me about when my dad died. It wasn't an accident. She killed him.

11
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,079
我很喜欢你。
I'm very fond of you.

12
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:35,039
我只是觉得我不能再这样下去了。
I just don't think I can do this any more.

13
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,399
是你告诉迈克尔·多布森的!
You told Michael bloody Dobson of all people!

14
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,599
白痴。下贱的婊子。
Idiot. Snotty bitch.

15
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,240
我们要结婚了。
We're getting married.

16
00:00:45,187 --> 00:01:29,698

17
00:01:36,565 --> 00:01:39,205
很明显，你什么都不用说。
Well, you don't have to say anything, obviously.

18
00:01:42,045 --> 00:01:43,444
什么时候?
When?

19
00:01:43,445 --> 00:01:45,564
嗯,我们……我们还没有解决细节问题。
Well, we'd... we'd not worked out the details.

20
00:01:45,565 --> 00:01:48,805
我们没时间了。
We haven't had time.

21
00:01:51,365 --> 00:01:53,364
好吧，你不必这么担心。
Well, you needn't look so worried.

22
00:01:53,365 --> 00:01:55,404
我不是。我,呃……
I'm not. I'm, er...

23
00:01:55,405 --> 00:01:58,924
不管怎样，我今天过得很累，
I've just had quite a long day, one way or another,

24
00:01:58,925 --> 00:02:01,765
所以我很想…
so I'd just quite like to, um...

25
00:02:03,285 --> 00:02:05,084
天啊，这是…
Gosh, well, this is, er...

26
00:02:05,085 --> 00:02:08,284
你的车呢?是的。哦，警察找到了。
Where's your car? Yeah. Oh, the police have got it.

27
00:02:08,285 --> 00:02:11,044
你的呢?搜捕联盟已经把车送到修理厂了。
What about yours? The RAC have taken it to a garage.

28
00:02:11,045 --> 00:02:13,164
在哈罗盖特吗?
In Harrogate?

29
00:02:13,165 --> 00:02:14,723
他们没载你一程吗?
Well, didn't they offer you a lift?

30
00:02:14,724 --> 00:02:17,083
他们应该带走你和你的车。
They're supposed to take you as well as your vehicle.

31
00:02:17,084 --> 00:02:19,485
好吧，他们可能做到了。我不知道。
Well, they may have done, possibly. I don't know.

32
00:02:19,486 --> 00:02:23,165
我不能丢下艾伦一个人。他有心脏病。
I couldn't leave Alan on his own. He has a heart condition.

33
00:02:24,205 --> 00:02:28,524
好吧，你们有彼此的电子邮件地址，所以……
Right, well, you've got each other's e-mail addresses so...

34
00:02:28,525 --> 00:02:29,564
完全正确。
Exactly.

35
00:02:29,565 --> 00:02:32,284
你不停下来喝杯茶吗?
Will you not stop and have a cup of tea?

36
00:02:32,285 --> 00:02:34,844
不。对不起，妈妈，我今晚有一千零一件事要做。
No. Sorry, Mum, I've got 1,001 things to do this evening.

37
00:02:34,845 --> 00:02:38,284
私立学校督察来了，所以…
I've got the Independent Schools Inspectorate coming in, so...

38
00:02:38,285 --> 00:02:40,284
我不介意停下来喝杯茶。
I don't mind stopping for a cup of tea.

39
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:43,844
既然我们在这里，我倒不介意去厕所。
I wouldn't mind the loo, actually, while we're here.

40
00:02:43,845 --> 00:02:46,364
好吧，我会把那女孩叫过来的。他们会以为我们搬进来了。
Well, I'll get the girl over. They'll think we've moved in.

41
00:02:46,365 --> 00:02:50,364
对不起，妈妈，我不能。我的车停在路中间。
Sorry, Mum, I can't. My car's parked in the middle of the road.

42
00:02:50,365 --> 00:02:52,484
你能找不到停车位吗?
Well, can you not find a parking space?

43
00:02:52,485 --> 00:02:55,004
不。艾伦，和你在一起很愉快。
No. Alan, it's been delightful.

44
00:02:55,005 --> 00:02:58,124
很抱歉我们不能多待了，但我真的有很多事要做。
Sorry we can't stay longer, but I really have got a lot to do.

45
00:02:58,125 --> 00:03:01,204
哦，那太遗憾了。那么，下次会发生吗?
Well, that's a shame. Another time, then, happen?

46
00:03:01,205 --> 00:03:03,964
绝对的。你能替我向吉莉安道别吗?
Absolutely. Will you say goodbye to Gillian for me?

47
00:03:03,965 --> 00:03:06,604
是的!我…我会的。
Yes! I... I will.

48
00:03:06,605 --> 00:03:10,204
好吧，看来我被赶出去了。
Right, well, looks like I'm being herded out.

49
00:03:10,205 --> 00:03:12,564
我要不要，呃……早上给你打电话?
Shall I, er... phone you in the morning?

50
00:03:12,565 --> 00:03:15,204
不,今晚。告诉我你平安回来了。
No, tonight. Let me know you've got back all right.

51
00:03:15,205 --> 00:03:16,884
哦,是的。是的，我会的。
Oh, yes. Yeah, I will.

52
00:03:16,885 --> 00:03:20,405
我是说，还没人祝贺我们。
I mean, nobody's actually congratulated us yet.

53
00:03:21,925 --> 00:03:24,524
我们在车里讨论好吗?讨论了吗?
Shall we discuss it in the car? Discuss it?

54
00:03:24,525 --> 00:03:28,084
呃…不，你应该这么做。她是对的。卡洛琳是对的。
Er... no, you should. She's right. Caroline's right.

55
00:03:28,085 --> 00:03:31,965
一切都需要…仔细思考。
Everything'll need... thinking through properly.

56
00:03:33,005 --> 00:03:34,685
不会吗?
Won't it?

57
00:03:36,645 --> 00:03:38,165
那么,再见。
Bye, then.

58
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:41,924
再见。
Bye-bye.

59
00:03:41,925 --> 00:03:44,244
祝贺你,爷爷。哦……
Congratulations, Granddad. Oh...

60
00:03:44,245 --> 00:03:46,284
这是Raffy吗?是的。
Is this Raffy? Yes.

61
00:03:46,285 --> 00:03:50,125
你好!他是不是很伟大?是的，他很好，是的。
How do you do? Isn't he grand? Aye, he's all right, aye.

62
00:03:52,325 --> 00:03:54,244
好吧，我得走了。
Well, I'll have to go.

63
00:03:54,245 --> 00:03:55,844
安全驾驶。
Drive safely.

64
00:03:55,845 --> 00:03:58,124
谢谢你！我们会的。
Thank you. We will.

65
00:03:58,125 --> 00:04:00,165
和你。回头见。
And you. Ta-ta.

66
00:04:02,725 --> 00:04:03,805
再见。
Bye-bye.

67
00:04:11,445 --> 00:04:16,125
今天真是不寻常的一天，不是吗，不管怎样?
It's been quite a day, hasn't it, one way and another?

68
00:04:34,165 --> 00:04:36,764
该死的，爷爷!结婚了吗?
Bloody hell, Granddad! Married?

69
00:04:36,765 --> 00:04:39,444
你是怎么做到的?
How have you managed that?!

70
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:41,445
我不太确定。
I'm not entirely sure.

71
00:04:43,725 --> 00:04:47,164
哦，只有上帝知道他们会怎么看我们!
Well, God alone knows what they must think about us!

72
00:04:47,165 --> 00:04:49,284
你本可以停下来喝杯茶。
You could have stopped and had a cup of tea.

73
00:04:49,285 --> 00:04:50,925
收割
Get in.

74
00:04:57,685 --> 00:05:01,404
我们是认真的，你知道的。我们对结婚是认真的。
We're serious, you know. We're serious about getting married.

75
00:05:01,405 --> 00:05:03,244
无论什么。
Whatever.

76
00:05:03,245 --> 00:05:05,764
我知道你认为我是疯子。
I know you think I'm crackers.

77
00:05:05,765 --> 00:05:09,285
妈妈，我什么都没想。我没时间想任何事。
Mum, I don't think anything. I don't have time to think anything.

78
00:05:12,845 --> 00:05:14,964
他们走了吗?是的。
Have they gone? Yeah.

79
00:05:14,965 --> 00:05:18,804
你到底在搞什么鬼!
What the hell on earth are you playing at?!

80
00:05:18,805 --> 00:05:20,045
你不喜欢她吗?
Did you not like her?

81
00:05:20,046 --> 00:05:22,604
喜欢她?但我不认识她。你不了解她。
Like her? But I don't know her. You don't know her.

82
00:05:22,605 --> 00:05:25,244
你已经六十年没见过她了。嗯，我喜欢她。
You haven't seen her for 60 years. Well, I liked her.

83
00:05:25,245 --> 00:05:28,084
不过我觉得她女儿有点难伺候。
The daughter strikes me as being a bit high-maintenance, though.

84
00:05:28,085 --> 00:05:29,844
她放你鸽子了。
She stood you up.

85
00:05:29,845 --> 00:05:31,803
显然不是。她当时骗了你。
Apparently not. She had you on then.

86
00:05:31,804 --> 00:05:33,605
你怎么知道她现在没骗你?
How do you know she's not having you on now?

87
00:05:33,606 --> 00:05:35,724
发生的事情是……还有那个该死的女儿!
What happened was... And that bloody daughter!

88
00:05:35,725 --> 00:05:38,124
哦，别误会我……开始了。拖车垃圾吗?
Oh, don't get me... started. Trailer trash?

89
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:39,764
发生的事情是……母狗!
What happened was... Bitch!

90
00:05:39,765 --> 00:05:42,404
发生的事情是……爸爸。我不想知道她是怎么扭曲的
What happened was... Dad. Don't want to know how she's twisted it

91
00:05:42,405 --> 00:05:46,484
试图让你相信黑即是白。因为你知道发生了什么。你告诉过我的。
and tried to make you believe black's white. Cos you know what happened. You told me.

92
00:05:46,485 --> 00:05:49,084
我稍后再告诉你。
I'll tell you later.

93
00:05:49,085 --> 00:05:50,965
你不必麻烦了。
You needn't bother.

94
00:06:13,085 --> 00:06:16,125
见到你!同上!
See you! Ditto!

95
00:06:34,965 --> 00:06:40,005
所以你对迈克尔·多布森很轻率?
So, you were indiscreet with Michael bloody Dobson?

96
00:06:42,245 --> 00:06:45,804
你对他说了什么?我只是有点含泪。
What did you say to him? I was just a bit tearful.

97
00:06:45,805 --> 00:06:48,844
我躲在图书室里，他进来了。
I was hiding in the book room and he came in.

98
00:06:48,845 --> 00:06:53,444
是的，你对他说了什么?他问我为什么…我说
Yes, and what did you say to him? He asked me why I was... and I said

99
00:06:53,445 --> 00:06:56,444
因为我一直在和别人约会然后那个人把我甩了
because I'd been seeing somebody and that that somebody had dumped me,

100
00:06:56,445 --> 00:06:58,925
然后我不小心把"他"说成了"她"
and then I accidentally said "she" instead of "he",

101
00:06:58,926 --> 00:07:01,404
他说:“天哪，是这里的人吗?”
and he said, "Oh, God, is it someone from here?"

102
00:07:01,405 --> 00:07:03,285
从那以后他就不肯罢休。
and he wouldn't let it drop after that.

103
00:07:03,286 --> 00:07:06,764
你说我的名字了吗?看起来……
Did you say my name? Look...

104
00:07:06,765 --> 00:07:08,524
你说我的名字了吗?是的。
Did you say my name? Yes.

105
00:07:08,525 --> 00:07:11,644
你到底跟他说了什么?
What exactly did you tell him?

106
00:07:11,645 --> 00:07:13,844
只是…
Just...

107
00:07:13,845 --> 00:07:16,085
你得说出来。
You're going to have to say it.

108
00:07:17,285 --> 00:07:19,164
我们吻了两次。
That we kissed twice.

109
00:07:19,165 --> 00:07:22,644
听着，他是我的伙伴。否则我不会告诉他的。
Look, he's a mate. I wouldn't have told him otherwise.

110
00:07:22,645 --> 00:07:25,885
他什么也不会说的。你生气了吗?
He's not going to say anything. Are you cross?

111
00:07:33,085 --> 00:07:34,325
不。
No.

112
00:07:49,525 --> 00:07:51,764
喂?
Hello?

113
00:07:51,765 --> 00:07:53,564
“早上好。”
'Good morning.'

114
00:07:53,565 --> 00:07:55,565
我想我应该过来看看。
I thought I might pop over.

115
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:01,044
哇呼!哦……
Yoo-hoo! Oh...

116
00:08:01,045 --> 00:08:02,644
有人在家吗?
Is anybody in?

117
00:08:02,645 --> 00:08:06,484
西莉亚!约翰。你忙吗?
Celia! John. Are you busy?

118
00:08:06,485 --> 00:08:11,724
我刚读到普罗西罗的部分，那是主要的中心。性格,
I've just got to the bit where Prothero, that's the main central... character,

119
00:08:11,725 --> 00:08:13,603
刚刚发现了他最好的朋友
has just discovered his best friend's

120
00:08:13,604 --> 00:08:15,765
他和他妈妈睡了十五年。
been sleeping with his mother for the last 15 years.

121
00:08:15,766 --> 00:08:19,084
哦,亲爱的。他和他的亲生母亲在一起吗?
Oh, dear. Has he, with his own mother?

122
00:08:19,085 --> 00:08:21,565
不。不,不。和普罗西罗的母亲一起。
No. No, no. With Prothero's mother.

123
00:08:22,885 --> 00:08:24,884
哦,好吧。好了。
Oh, well. There we go.

124
00:08:24,885 --> 00:08:28,524
嗯…如果你没事的话，能让我搭你的车去车库吗?
Um... could you give me a lift to the garage if you're not doing anything?

125
00:08:28,525 --> 00:08:30,124
只是他们把我分类了
Only they've sorted me out

126
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:33,404
一辆小礼宾车，我要去哈利法克斯。
a little courtesy car, and I've got to get over to Halifax.

127
00:08:33,405 --> 00:08:39,404
做了……卡洛琳说我搬回来住了吗?
Did... Did Caroline explain that I've moved back in?

128
00:08:39,405 --> 00:08:41,244
是的，是的，她说了。
Yeah, yeah, she did.

129
00:08:41,245 --> 00:08:42,924
好。
Good.

130
00:08:42,925 --> 00:08:45,724
问题是，它很脆弱。
The thing is, it's delicate.

131
00:08:45,725 --> 00:08:47,725
是的。
Yeah.

132
00:08:52,645 --> 00:08:56,044
我错了，西莉亚。我就不该离开她。
Oh, I made a mistake, Celia. I should never have left her.

133
00:08:56,045 --> 00:08:58,844
我把事情搞得一团糟。
I've made such a bloody mess of things.

134
00:08:58,845 --> 00:09:01,205
她把我安排在空房间了，这很好。
She's put me in the spare room, which is fine, you know.

135
00:09:01,206 --> 00:09:02,965
这是……这是……
It's... it's...

136
00:09:04,565 --> 00:09:06,764
问题是，很明显，如果你愿意，
The thing is, obviously, if you felt inclined,

137
00:09:06,765 --> 00:09:09,725
如果……如果你能美言几句……
if... if you could put in a good word...

138
00:09:10,725 --> 00:09:14,324
对我来说……和她在一起。你看，她听你的。
for me... with her. You see, she listens to you.

139
00:09:14,325 --> 00:09:16,884
哈!什么时候? !不，她有。
Huh! When?! No, she does.

140
00:09:16,885 --> 00:09:19,484
如果对她合适的话，洪水就来一次。
Happen once a flood, if it suits her.

141
00:09:19,485 --> 00:09:23,005
我只是希望一切恢复正常，西莉亚。
I just want everything to get back to normal, Celia.

142
00:09:25,645 --> 00:09:28,844
你觉得我的消息怎么样?什么消息?
What do you think about my news? What news?

143
00:09:28,845 --> 00:09:30,685
我和艾伦。
Me and Alan.

144
00:09:34,165 --> 00:09:36,804
西莉亚的响。风扇皮带又没了。
Celia's rung. Fan belt's gone again.

145
00:09:36,805 --> 00:09:40,044
她过来了。什么时候?现在。
She's popping over. When? Now.

146
00:09:40,045 --> 00:09:43,605
对什么?因为有事情要讨论。
What for? Well, because there's stuff to discuss.

147
00:09:44,845 --> 00:09:47,284
拉夫昨天从学校回来了。
Raff came home from school yesterday...

148
00:09:47,285 --> 00:09:49,764
问艾迪什么时候死的
asking questions about when Eddie died.

149
00:09:49,765 --> 00:09:51,284
什么样的问题?
What sort of questions?

150
00:09:51,285 --> 00:09:52,844
哦……
Oh...

151
00:09:52,845 --> 00:09:54,164
为什么昨天?
Why yesterday?

152
00:09:54,165 --> 00:09:57,085
因为罗比在学校外面出现了。
Because Robbie turned up outside the school.

153
00:09:58,085 --> 00:10:00,364
说的东西。什么东西?
Saying stuff. What stuff?

154
00:10:00,365 --> 00:10:02,925
废话连篇。
The usual crap.

155
00:10:05,005 --> 00:10:07,964
但如果他突然开始说…
But what if he gets it into his head to start talking about...

156
00:10:07,965 --> 00:10:10,165
其他的事情，比如……
other things, like...

157
00:10:11,765 --> 00:10:13,325
到底发生了什么。
what really happened.

158
00:10:14,485 --> 00:10:16,644
他不会那么傻吧?
He wouldn't be that daft, surely?

159
00:10:16,645 --> 00:10:18,085
罗比吗?
Robbie?

160
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:23,084
他肯定会把拉菲的脑子弄得比你的脑子更乱。
He'll have messed with Raffy's head more than yours, surely.

161
00:10:23,085 --> 00:10:25,084
他知道这一点。
He knows that.

162
00:10:25,085 --> 00:10:27,085
我觉得他没想那么多，爸爸。
I don't think he cogitates that far, Dad.

163
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:34,084
她特地来这里
She actually coming here, specifically,

164
00:10:34,085 --> 00:10:36,564
而不是，你知道，在这里?
as opposed to, you know, here in general?

165
00:10:36,565 --> 00:10:39,204
是的，是的，在这里。
Yeah, yes, here.

166
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:43,645
因为你知道，在外人看来，这地方确实像个垃圾场?
Cos you do realise, to fresh eyes, the place does look like a dump?

167
00:10:52,045 --> 00:10:54,524
卡洛琳?
Caroline?

168
00:10:54,525 --> 00:10:57,404
你丈夫在跟我打电话。他说事情很紧急。
I've got your husband on the phone. He says it's urgent.

169
00:10:57,405 --> 00:10:58,445
给他接过来。
Put him through.

170
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:06,164
约翰。
John.

171
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:08,524
你没告诉我你妈要结婚了。
You didn't tell me your ma's getting married.

172
00:11:08,525 --> 00:11:10,324
发生了一件事吗?“是的。”
Something happened? 'Yeah.'

173
00:11:10,325 --> 00:11:12,124
你妈妈要结婚了。
Your mother's getting married.

174
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:14,964
对不起，有急事吗?这是令人愉快的。
Sorry, is this urgent? It's delightful.

175
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:19,844
这是无稽之谈。这不会发生的。他们……你知道她是什么样的人。
It's nonsense. It won't happen. They... You know what she's like.

176
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:21,964
它……她一分钟前都是为了某件事
It... She's all for something one minute,

177
00:11:21,965 --> 00:11:25,364
然后半小时，十分钟后，她就完全失去理智了。
then half an hour, ten minutes later, she's gone completely off it.

178
00:11:25,365 --> 00:11:29,164
就像她想…买一台传真机。“嗯，我不知道。”
It's like when she wanted to... buy a fax machine. 'Well, I don't know.'

179
00:11:29,165 --> 00:11:31,244
她开车去哈利法克斯看他。
She's driving over to Halifax to see him.

180
00:11:31,245 --> 00:11:33,924
什么时候?“现在”。
When? 'Now.'

181
00:11:33,925 --> 00:11:35,764
她租了一辆小车。
She's picked up a little hire car.

182
00:11:35,765 --> 00:11:37,644
我妈妈租了一辆车?
My mother has hired a car?

183
00:11:37,645 --> 00:11:40,684
不，这是一辆小礼宾车。
Well, no, it's a little courtesy car.

184
00:11:40,685 --> 00:11:42,043
看起来……天啊，她会迷路的。
Look... God, she'll get lost.

185
00:11:42,044 --> 00:11:44,085
不，上面有个卫星导航的东西…在里面。
No, it's got a little sat-nav thingy on it... in it.

186
00:11:44,086 --> 00:11:47,004
“那家伙教她怎么用，所以……”
'And the bloke showed her how it works so...'

187
00:11:47,005 --> 00:11:48,364
她带手机了吗?
Did she take her mobile?

188
00:11:48,365 --> 00:11:51,084
我不知道。可能。
I don't know. Probably.

189
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:52,884
你不觉得……
Don't you think it's...

190
00:11:52,885 --> 00:11:55,244
怎么啦？“我不知道。”
What? 'I don't know.'

191
00:11:55,245 --> 00:12:00,404
壮志凌云。适当地，你知道，适当地。
Life-affirming. Properly, you know, proper.

192
00:12:00,405 --> 00:12:02,125
令人振奋的。好。
Uplifting. Good.

193
00:12:03,725 --> 00:12:06,085
这一切都是为了什么，真的。
What it's all for, really.

194
00:12:07,845 --> 00:12:08,965
卡洛琳?
Caroline?

195
00:12:12,045 --> 00:12:14,364
我不知道。
I don't know.

196
00:12:14,365 --> 00:12:17,964
我不知道。我得走了。你今晚想出去吃晚饭吗?
I don't know. Look, I've got to go. Do you want to go out for dinner tonight?

197
00:12:17,965 --> 00:12:21,444
我…不。
I... No.

198
00:12:21,445 --> 00:12:24,324
有人在敲门。我得走了。
Someone at the door. I'd better go.

199
00:12:24,325 --> 00:12:27,245
再见。再见。再见。
Bye. Bye. Bye.

200
00:12:30,005 --> 00:12:31,045
朱迪思?
Judith?

201
00:12:34,245 --> 00:12:36,364
你好,迈克尔。我可以……
Hello, Michael. Could I...

202
00:12:36,365 --> 00:12:38,164
看到你吗?是的，当然。
see you? Yes, of course.

203
00:12:38,165 --> 00:12:40,284
贝弗利在那里，如果你想预约的话。
Beverley's there if you want an appointment.

204
00:12:40,285 --> 00:12:41,845
我是说，呃……
I meant, er...

205
00:12:43,325 --> 00:12:44,564
现在。
now.

206
00:12:44,565 --> 00:12:46,924
是关于什么的?嗯…
What's it about? Well...

207
00:12:46,925 --> 00:12:48,965
这是……
it's...

208
00:12:50,045 --> 00:12:51,805
确定。
Sure.

209
00:12:59,485 --> 00:13:00,764
凯特。凯特。
Kate. Kate.

210
00:13:00,765 --> 00:13:02,724
那她呢?
What about her?

211
00:13:02,725 --> 00:13:06,404
她有……一直在说些什么。
She has... been saying things.

212
00:13:06,405 --> 00:13:09,765
也许你应该知道的事情。
Things that perhaps you ought to be aware of.

213
00:13:12,925 --> 00:13:15,565
好的。所以…
OK. So...

214
00:13:17,325 --> 00:13:19,564
她暗示…
she implied...

215
00:13:19,565 --> 00:13:21,324
嗯。她说,
Hmm. She said,

216
00:13:21,325 --> 00:13:25,804
而且，你看，她可能不只是对我说这些话，
and, you see, it's not just me that she may be saying these things to,

217
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:29,245
和…它可能是有害的……
and... it could be damaging...

218
00:13:30,805 --> 00:13:34,324
若有总督，就归你们
to you if any governors

219
00:13:34,325 --> 00:13:36,524
或者父母，等等，
or parents, et cetera,

220
00:13:36,525 --> 00:13:38,325
还是……还是……
or... or...

221
00:13:39,325 --> 00:13:40,485
你两个儿子中的一个…
one of your two boys...

222
00:13:42,805 --> 00:13:44,844
甚至,
even,

223
00:13:44,845 --> 00:13:46,724
例如,
for instance,

224
00:13:46,725 --> 00:13:48,045
听说…
got wind of...

225
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:50,685
你想要什么，迈克尔?
What do you want, Michael?

226
00:13:53,485 --> 00:13:56,205
为你的“横跨欧洲”项目增加预算?
Bigger budget for your Hands Across Europe project?

227
00:13:58,445 --> 00:14:00,884
阿斯皮诺尔夫人离职后，你会成为系主任吗?
Head of department when Mrs Aspinall moves on?

228
00:14:00,885 --> 00:14:05,005
看起来……我可以…谨慎。
Look... I can be... discreet.

229
00:14:06,205 --> 00:14:09,445
滚开，你这个小混蛋。你真以为你能羞辱我吗?
Sod off, you little prick. Do you really think you can humiliate me?

230
00:14:10,645 --> 00:14:12,724
去吧，天才。散布一些谣言。
Go for it, genius. Spread a few rumours.

231
00:14:12,725 --> 00:14:16,484
它会比我更能说明你。这是2012年。
It'll say more about you than it ever will about me. This is 2012.

232
00:14:16,485 --> 00:14:19,564
我单身。她是单身。我们是成年人。
I'm single. She's single. We're adults.

233
00:14:19,565 --> 00:14:22,244
我们有过一段风流韵事。女士们已经着陆了。
We had a fling. The ladies have landed.

234
00:14:22,245 --> 00:14:24,644
其实是很久以前的事了。克服它吧。
Quite a long time ago, in fact. Get over it.

235
00:14:24,645 --> 00:14:28,084
她跟你说话是因为她很难过，你就这么回应吗?
She spoke to you because she was upset, and this is how you respond?

236
00:14:28,085 --> 00:14:31,484
糟糕的举动。也为你感到羞耻。
Bad move. And shame on you, as well.

237
00:14:31,485 --> 00:14:34,445
出去的时候别关门。
Leave the door open on your way out.

238
00:14:47,445 --> 00:14:49,725
Psss-choo !
Psss-choo!

239
00:14:50,885 --> 00:14:54,404
我真的伤害你了吗?是的。
Did I really hurt you? Yeah.

240
00:14:54,405 --> 00:14:57,004
天哪，太可怕了。
God, that's appalling.

241
00:14:57,005 --> 00:14:58,445
是的。
Yeah.

242
00:15:01,365 --> 00:15:02,405
疼吗?
Did it hurt?

243
00:15:06,365 --> 00:15:09,004
我想“对不起”还不够……
I suppose "sorry" doesn't even start to...

244
00:15:09,005 --> 00:15:12,565
嗯，你知道，它很复杂。我理解。
Well, you know, it's complex. I understand that.

245
00:15:13,885 --> 00:15:17,685
朱蒂丝，我对你在卡罗琳的厨房里不太放心。
Judith, I'm not entirely comfortable about you being here in Caroline's kitchen.

246
00:15:18,885 --> 00:15:22,164
为什么?她在这儿吗?不，当然不是。她在上班。
Why? Is she here? No, of course not. She's at work.

247
00:15:22,165 --> 00:15:24,764
没有人在这里。这是你的厨房，不是吗?
No-one's here. It is your kitchen, though, isn't it?

248
00:15:24,765 --> 00:15:28,804
和她的一样多吗?你拿着这个点。
As much as it is hers? You take the point.

249
00:15:28,805 --> 00:15:30,644
我要你回来。不。
I want you to come back. No.

250
00:15:30,645 --> 00:15:32,764
我不想再这样下去了。
I don't want to be like this any more.

251
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:36,285
嗯，是的，你当然不知道，你也不应该知道，但是……
Well, yes, of course you don't, and you shouldn't, but...

252
00:15:39,325 --> 00:15:41,084
朱蒂丝，反正我也会离开的。
Judith, I'd have left anyway.

253
00:15:41,085 --> 00:15:44,564
为什么?因为它已经走到了尽头。
Why? Because it had run its course.

254
00:15:44,565 --> 00:15:48,364
你以为你能像那样把人抓起来，然后把他们扔下吗?
You think you can just pick people up like that, and then just drop them?

255
00:15:48,365 --> 00:15:51,884
当然，当人们开始打人的时候，是的。
Well, certainly when people start hitting people, yes.

256
00:15:51,885 --> 00:15:54,165
这更像是一种选择。
It makes it more of an option.

257
00:15:56,645 --> 00:15:59,925
你为什么回到这里来?我们讨论过这个。
Why have you come back here? We went through this.

258
00:16:01,005 --> 00:16:03,164
我们吗?这是我的归属。
Did we? It's where I belong.

259
00:16:03,165 --> 00:16:05,644
你总是说它让你窒息。
You always said it stifled you.

260
00:16:05,645 --> 00:16:07,804
我想我和卡罗琳又回到了原点
I think I've come full circle with Caroline.

261
00:16:07,805 --> 00:16:12,604
我不明白，因为我们在一起是那么美好，那么快乐，那么激动人心。
I don't get it, because we were so good and happy and exciting together.

262
00:16:12,605 --> 00:16:15,244
你和我一样喜欢喝酒。
And you like a drink just as much as I do.

263
00:16:15,245 --> 00:16:19,125
不是……和你一样喜欢。
Not... quite as much as you do.

264
00:16:20,085 --> 00:16:22,524
我只是…
I just...

265
00:16:22,525 --> 00:16:25,364
我只是不知道我该期待什么，约翰。
I just don't know what I've got to look forward to, John.

266
00:16:25,365 --> 00:16:27,004
我是认真的。
I'm serious.

267
00:16:27,005 --> 00:16:29,404
我今年43岁，
I'm 43 years old,

268
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:31,844
和…我在找工作，
and... I'm between jobs,

269
00:16:31,845 --> 00:16:37,085
而我的生活就在一个又一个尴尬的不幸中蹒跚而行。
and my life just lurches from one embarrassing mishap to the next.

270
00:16:38,325 --> 00:16:40,524
我很无聊!
And I'm bored!

271
00:16:40,525 --> 00:16:42,925
厌倦了想这到底有什么意义。
Bored of wondering what the point is.

272
00:17:01,885 --> 00:17:05,004
-你在干什么?-我去过阁楼。
- What you doing? - I've been in the attic.

273
00:17:05,005 --> 00:17:06,444
哦，是吗?是的。
Oh, have you? Yeah.

274
00:17:06,445 --> 00:17:09,764
爬上那该死的旧梯子?你知道你不应该上去…
Up that bloody old ladder? You know you're not supposed to go up...

275
00:17:09,765 --> 00:17:12,004
给我吧。不，我能行。
Let me have that. No, I can manage.

276
00:17:12,005 --> 00:17:13,884
你坐下。来吧，到这里来。
You sit down. Come on, down here.

277
00:17:13,885 --> 00:17:16,844
都是那些老照片。是的，是的，我知道是什么。
It's all those old photos. Yeah, yeah, I know what it is.

278
00:17:16,845 --> 00:17:20,004
我的天啊。我好多年没见过这个了。
Oh, my God. I haven't seen this for years.

279
00:17:20,005 --> 00:17:23,004
我也不。它在一堆东西下面。
Me neither. It were under a load of stuff.

280
00:17:23,005 --> 00:17:25,324
你应该喊我的。是的。
You should have shouted me. Yeah.

281
00:17:25,325 --> 00:17:26,405
我只是在院子里。
I was only in the yard.

282
00:17:26,406 --> 00:17:29,964
你知道你不应该到处乱摸东西的。
You know you're not supposed to go hoicking stuff around.

283
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:32,684
我确信我有她的照片。
I was certain I had a picture of her.

284
00:17:32,685 --> 00:17:36,284
我们几个人排成一排，坐在长凳上，
There were a few of us in a row, sitting on a bench,

285
00:17:36,285 --> 00:17:38,164
在芬兰的一个公园里。
up at t'park in Elland.

286
00:17:38,165 --> 00:17:41,005
噢,看。这是马。啊。
Oh, look. It's Ma. Ah.

287
00:17:42,445 --> 00:17:44,165
她当时多大了?
How old would she have been there?

288
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:48,484
嗯，那是……背上写着什么?
Well, that's, er... What does it say on t'back?

289
00:17:48,485 --> 00:17:50,324
1953.
1953.

290
00:17:50,325 --> 00:17:55,204
16. 你看。那大概是我最后一次见到西莉亚的时间。
16. There, you see. That's round about the time that I last saw Celia.

291
00:17:55,205 --> 00:17:57,044
啊，她比Raffy还小。
Ah, she's younger than Raffy.

292
00:17:57,045 --> 00:17:58,964
哦,明白她是不是很漂亮?
Oh, aye. Isn't she pretty?

293
00:17:58,965 --> 00:18:00,765
啊，她真可爱。
Ah, she were lovely.

294
00:18:02,165 --> 00:18:04,564
我的天啊。
Oh, my God.

295
00:18:04,565 --> 00:18:07,444
我好多年没见过这个了。你的结婚照。
I've not seen this for years. Your wedding photo.

296
00:18:07,445 --> 00:18:09,925
哦，你们俩是不是都很可爱?
Oh, weren't you both lovely?

297
00:18:11,045 --> 00:18:12,885
我们应该把它挂在什么地方。
We ought to have this up somewhere.

298
00:18:12,886 --> 00:18:15,244
在一个框架里。
In a frame.

299
00:18:15,245 --> 00:18:18,964
啊呀。看我妈妈的裙子。嘿，好了。
Blimey. Look at my mother's dress. Hey, now, then.

300
00:18:18,965 --> 00:18:23,204
学校的照片。我们都在这，我，你妈妈和西莉亚。
School photo. We'll all be on here - me, your mum and Celia.

301
00:18:23,205 --> 00:18:25,324
我们去肉店吧。
Let's have a butcher's.

302
00:18:25,325 --> 00:18:27,404
我的天啊。
Oh, my God.

303
00:18:27,405 --> 00:18:30,084
看看他们的短裤和小膝盖。
Look at all them shorts and little knees.

304
00:18:30,085 --> 00:18:32,324
是的,是的。嗯，是我。
Yeah, yeah. Eeh, that's me.

305
00:18:32,325 --> 00:18:34,564
看。啊!
Look. Ah!

306
00:18:34,565 --> 00:18:38,004
你很可爱吧?喂，你在说什么?
Aren't you sweet? Hey, here, what you on about?

307
00:18:38,005 --> 00:18:41,805
我看起来很有男子气概。我的意思是……我是说有男子气概。我说的是"男子气概"。
I looked manly. I meant... I meant manly. I said "manly".

308
00:18:42,845 --> 00:18:46,764
你看起来不像个男子汉，爸爸。你才12岁。
You don't look manly, Dad. You're 12 years old.

309
00:18:46,765 --> 00:18:49,724
嘿，那是艾琳，那是…
Hey, there's Eileen and there's...

310
00:18:49,725 --> 00:18:52,764
它是。就是她，就是她。西莉亚。
It is. That's her, that's her. That's Celia.

311
00:18:52,765 --> 00:18:53,924
啊。
Ah.

312
00:18:53,925 --> 00:18:57,525
中间是多琳·威尔金森。
And that's Doreen Wilkinson in between.

313
00:19:00,245 --> 00:19:02,165
他死了。
He's dead.

314
00:19:03,685 --> 00:19:05,725
他死了。
He's dead.

315
00:19:07,245 --> 00:19:09,165
她去世了。
She died.

316
00:19:11,085 --> 00:19:13,085
他到南方去了。毫米。
He went down south. Mm.

317
00:19:15,565 --> 00:19:18,484
好吧，听着，我…我得上车了。
Right, look, I... I'd better get on.

318
00:19:18,485 --> 00:19:19,844
毫米吗?哦。
Mm? Oh.

319
00:19:19,845 --> 00:19:22,804
你是打算收拾一下，还是懒得收拾?
Are you going to tidy it up, or are you not bothering?

320
00:19:22,805 --> 00:19:24,725
我以为我已经整理好了。是吗?
Well, I thought I'd tidied. Did you?

321
00:19:24,726 --> 00:19:26,404
哦,好吧。
Oh, OK.

322
00:19:26,405 --> 00:19:29,724
但这不是……不，没关系。
But is it not... No, it's fine.

323
00:19:29,725 --> 00:19:32,764
对的,享受。Ta-ra。
Right, enjoy. Ta-ra.

324
00:19:32,765 --> 00:19:33,925
哈哈。
Ha.

325
00:19:38,045 --> 00:19:39,925
哦……
Oh...

326
00:20:18,885 --> 00:20:20,485
你好。
Hello.

327
00:20:22,285 --> 00:20:26,324
我躺在床上睡了半夜，不知道这是不是我做的梦。
I lay awake half the night, wondering if I'd dreamt it.

328
00:20:26,325 --> 00:20:27,764
我也是，你呢?
So did I. Did you?

329
00:20:27,765 --> 00:20:34,525
嗯,没有。它更多的是躺着不睡觉，想知道我是否理解错了。
Well, no. It were more laying awake wondering if I'd got the wrong end of the stick.

330
00:20:36,165 --> 00:20:38,085
我收拾了一下。
I tidied up.

331
00:20:39,645 --> 00:20:41,244
你的景色很美。
You've got a lovely view.

332
00:20:41,245 --> 00:20:43,204
哦，冬天是苦的。
Oh, it's bitter in winter.

333
00:20:43,205 --> 00:20:46,404
你有没有考虑过我们住在哪里?
Have you given any thought as to where we might live?

334
00:20:46,405 --> 00:20:50,724
我们有几个选择。那是我在巴克岛的小屋。
We've a few options. There's my little house up Barkisland.

335
00:20:50,725 --> 00:20:52,964
我在卡洛琳家的公寓。
There's my flat at Caroline's.

336
00:20:52,965 --> 00:20:56,084
然后是这里。那里的房间。哦。
Then there's here. There's room. Oh.

337
00:20:56,085 --> 00:20:58,364
你的吉莉安会喜欢吗?哦,明白
Would your Gillian like that? Oh, aye.

338
00:20:58,365 --> 00:21:01,444
我在农场有钱，所以她不会真的反对。
I have money in the farm, so she couldn't really object.

339
00:21:01,445 --> 00:21:05,084
她不会的。我也一样。
Not that she would. Well, I'm the same.

340
00:21:05,085 --> 00:21:08,204
没有我的帮助，他们不可能买下哈罗盖特的那栋大房子。
They'd never have been able to buy that big house in Harrogate without my input.

341
00:21:08,205 --> 00:21:10,484
如果我们真想住在我的小房子里，
If we did want to live in my little house,

342
00:21:10,485 --> 00:21:13,044
我得提前一个月通知达伦和金伯利……
I'd have to give Darren and Kimberley a month's notice...

343
00:21:13,045 --> 00:21:14,604
租户。
the tenants.

344
00:21:14,605 --> 00:21:17,524
我也想这么做，但他们刚生了孩子。
Which I'd do, but they've just had a baby.

345
00:21:17,525 --> 00:21:18,965
哦。
Oh.

346
00:21:21,245 --> 00:21:25,044
你在电话里说的汽车保险是怎么回事?
What were you saying about car insurance on the phone?

347
00:21:25,045 --> 00:21:27,484
哦。好。
Oh. Well.

348
00:21:27,485 --> 00:21:29,924
史蒂夫说的，史蒂夫在车库…
What Steve said, Steve at the garage...

349
00:21:29,925 --> 00:21:32,684
他跟保险有什么关系?哦,没什么。
What's he got to do with insurance? Oh, nothing.

350
00:21:32,685 --> 00:21:36,684
他只是说因为我开车撞到了你的车尾，
He was just saying that because I drove into the back of your vehicle,

351
00:21:36,685 --> 00:21:40,644
在我这个年纪，他们不仅会提高我的保费，
at my age, not only might they bump up my premiums,

352
00:21:40,645 --> 00:21:44,684
下次他们可能会完全拒绝给我投保。
they might refuse to insure me altogether another time.

353
00:21:44,685 --> 00:21:47,125
开车是我仅有的一点独立，
It's my only little bit of independence, this driving,

354
00:21:47,126 --> 00:21:50,004
所以，我在想…
so, I was wondering...

355
00:21:50,005 --> 00:21:51,644
我不会说的。
I won't claim.

356
00:21:51,645 --> 00:21:54,444
我是说，我会赔偿损失的。不，你不会的!
I mean, I will pay for the damage. No, you won't!

357
00:21:54,445 --> 00:21:57,484
哦，我会的。你喜欢争论这件事吗?
Oh, I will. Do you fancy arguing about it?

358
00:21:57,485 --> 00:21:58,765
午餐时，出去吗?
Over lunch, out?

359
00:21:58,766 --> 00:22:02,524
吉莉安说我们可以坐路虎。她这船尾不需要它。”
Gillian says we can take the Land Rover. She doesn't need it this aft'.

360
00:22:02,525 --> 00:22:04,484
或者是我的小礼宾车。
Or there's my little courtesy car.

361
00:22:04,485 --> 00:22:07,365
我们有太多的决定。我们有太多选择了。
We have too many decisions. We're spoilt for choice.

362
00:22:09,485 --> 00:22:12,124
我从来没坐过路虎。
Well, I've never been in a Land Rover.

363
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:14,405
哦，确实不舒服。
Oh, it's right uncomfortable.

364
00:22:16,365 --> 00:22:19,364
不，先生，我可以把mc拆开
♪ No, sir, I could tear apart MCs

我告诉你，吉莉安
I tell you what, Gillian,

372
00:22:45,084 --> 00:22:47,405
你在田野里弯腰的时候有种感觉
there's something about you bending over in a field

373
00:22:47,406 --> 00:22:49,844
这让我几乎无法控制自己。
that makes me almost unable to contain myself.

374
00:22:49,845 --> 00:22:52,524
滚开，保罗。
Piss off, Paul.

375
00:22:52,525 --> 00:22:56,484
你点头，我就会越过这堵墙，在你说，
You give the nod, and I'll be over this wall and up behind you before you can say,

376
00:22:56,485 --> 00:22:59,844
“你应该和那个尺寸的人一起在杂志上摆姿势，保罗。”
"You ought to be posing in magazines with one that size, Paul."

377
00:22:59,845 --> 00:23:01,205
现在走吧。
Move along now.

378
00:23:04,445 --> 00:23:06,084
我一直希望你能给我发短信。
I keep hoping you'll text me.

379
00:23:06,085 --> 00:23:09,685
多么奇怪。你知道你喜欢它。
How weird. You know you like it.

380
00:23:11,885 --> 00:23:13,965
有人在你家里吗?
There anybody in at your house?

381
00:23:15,085 --> 00:23:18,325
为什么?还有半个小时。
Why? Got a half hour.

382
00:23:27,965 --> 00:23:29,605
那不是你的路虎吗?
Ain't that your Land Rover?

383
00:23:34,925 --> 00:23:36,684
半小时?
Half an hour?

384
00:23:36,685 --> 00:23:39,444
当然，还有另一种选择。
Of course, there is another option.

385
00:23:39,445 --> 00:23:41,284
是吗?是的。
Is there? Yeah.

386
00:23:41,285 --> 00:23:44,204
等我们结婚了，我们就不需要两辆车了，对吧?
When we're married, we won't need both cars, will we?

387
00:23:44,205 --> 00:23:49,324
所以，我们为什么不把它们都卖掉，买一些我们一直喜欢的东西呢?
So, why don't we trade them both in and buy something we've always fancied?

388
00:23:49,325 --> 00:23:51,964
你有什么想法吗?是的。
Well, did you have summat in mind? Yeah.

389
00:23:51,965 --> 00:23:55,085
我不敢告诉你什么。你会觉得我疯了。
I daren't tell you what. You'll think I'm crackers.

390
00:24:31,765 --> 00:24:33,284
你好。你是那辆出租车吗?
Hello. Are you the taxi?

391
00:24:33,285 --> 00:24:36,124
爸爸?爸爸!
Dad? Dad!

392
00:24:36,125 --> 00:24:38,365
怎么啦？是吗?
What? Yes?

393
00:24:41,125 --> 00:24:43,324
大便。威廉?
Shit. William?

394
00:24:43,325 --> 00:24:46,724
呃…这是……你在…你这个时候在这儿干什么?
Er... this is... What are you... what are you doing here at this time?

395
00:24:46,725 --> 00:24:47,884
修订。
Revision.

396
00:24:47,885 --> 00:24:50,644
一个水平。考试，中间。
A levels. Exams, middle of.

397
00:24:50,645 --> 00:24:54,724
没错，嗯……朱蒂丝，这是威廉，我的长子。你好。
That's right, er... Judith, this is William, my eldest. Hello.

398
00:24:54,725 --> 00:24:57,884
威廉，这是…她在这里做什么?
William, this is... What's she doing here?

399
00:24:57,885 --> 00:25:00,845
什么都没有,什么都没有。老实说，没什么，威廉。它很好。
Nothing, nothing. Honestly, nothing, William. It's fine.

400
00:25:03,205 --> 00:25:05,164
那是我的出租车。太好了。
That'll be my taxi. Great.

401
00:25:05,165 --> 00:25:07,084
将它吗?我的天啊。
Will it? Oh, my God.

402
00:25:07,085 --> 00:25:10,484
你恶心。真的没什么……我去开门好吗?
You're disgusting. It's really nothing... Shall I answer the door?

403
00:25:10,485 --> 00:25:13,765
你喝了多少酒?我想我会的。
How much have you had to drink? I think I will.

404
00:25:19,365 --> 00:25:22,884
朱迪思已经……有点问题。
Judith has... a bit of a problem.

405
00:25:22,885 --> 00:25:24,884
她有吗?是的。
SHE has? Yeah.

406
00:25:24,885 --> 00:25:27,604
明白了，但是……她不应该在这房子里。
Point taken, but... She shouldn't be in this house.

407
00:25:27,605 --> 00:25:29,365
让……让我…
Let... let me just...

408
00:25:33,085 --> 00:25:35,244
我就……你能……吗?
I'll just... Can you...?

409
00:25:35,245 --> 00:25:37,684
喂?
Hello?

410
00:25:37,685 --> 00:25:41,364
约翰，是我。嗨！你好!
John, it's me. Hi! Hello!

411
00:25:41,365 --> 00:25:44,124
“我在想，嗯……”
'I was thinking, um...'

412
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:48,844
也许我们应该找个时间一起出去，然后…
maybe we should go out together sometime, and, um...

413
00:25:48,845 --> 00:25:52,205
“谈谈事情，嗯……”
'talk about things and, er...'

414
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:56,844
试着找到一条正确的道路。
try and find a proper way forward.

415
00:25:56,845 --> 00:26:00,404
太好了。是的。好。
Great. Yes. Good.

416
00:26:00,405 --> 00:26:03,244
今晚不行。我要做的事太多了。
Not tonight. I've just got far too much on.

417
00:26:03,245 --> 00:26:05,604
但是,嗯…一些时间。
But, um... some time.

418
00:26:05,605 --> 00:26:07,885
不，不，好吧。这是……这很好。
No, no, fine. That's... that's fine.

419
00:26:09,245 --> 00:26:11,845
正确的,那么。我…我很乐意。
Right, then. I'd... I'd like that.

420
00:26:13,325 --> 00:26:15,285
正确的。
Right.

421
00:26:19,805 --> 00:26:21,485
正确的。
Right.

422
00:26:23,645 --> 00:26:26,484
那么,再见。再见。
Bye, then. Bye.

423
00:26:26,485 --> 00:26:29,245
再见。
Bye-bye.

424
00:26:39,205 --> 00:26:41,044
她走了吗?
Has she gone?

425
00:26:41,045 --> 00:26:46,364
如果你不跟妈妈提这件事就好了……
It'd be, like, really good if you didn't mention this to Mum...

426
00:26:46,365 --> 00:26:48,524
哈!．.因为，老实说，我…
Huh! ..because, honestly, I was...

427
00:26:48,525 --> 00:26:51,125
我只是想摆脱她。威廉。
I was just trying to get rid of her. William.

428
00:26:57,205 --> 00:27:00,164
昨晚你开车回家的时候卡罗琳还好吗?
Was Caroline all right when you drove home last night?

429
00:27:00,165 --> 00:27:01,325
卡洛琳?是的。
Caroline? Yeah.

430
00:27:02,925 --> 00:27:04,924
是的，我想是的。
Yes, I think so.

431
00:27:04,925 --> 00:27:08,525
她似乎心事重重。她总是这样。
She seemed preoccupied. She always is.

432
00:27:10,205 --> 00:27:13,285
我想这对他们俩来说都有点震惊。
I suppose it was a bit of a shock for 'em both.

433
00:27:14,845 --> 00:27:16,924
我觉得卡罗琳不高兴。
I don't think Caroline's happy.

434
00:27:16,925 --> 00:27:19,884
怎么啦？关于我们?任何东西。
What? About us? About anything.

435
00:27:19,885 --> 00:27:23,324
她嫁给了这个…约翰。
She's married to this... John.

436
00:27:23,325 --> 00:27:28,644
哦，他可以很有趣，但他完全是浪费空间。
Oh, he can be quite entertaining but he's a complete waste of space.

437
00:27:28,645 --> 00:27:32,164
他在约克大学工作。
He works at the university in York.

438
00:27:32,165 --> 00:27:34,324
当它适合他的时候。
When it suits him.

439
00:27:34,325 --> 00:27:36,324
他还写小说。
And he writes novels.

440
00:27:36,325 --> 00:27:38,604
发表,但是……
Published, but...

441
00:27:38,605 --> 00:27:39,925
他们是邪恶。
they're nowt.

442
00:27:42,925 --> 00:27:45,324
他和另一个女人私奔了。
He went off with another woman.

443
00:27:45,325 --> 00:27:47,044
朱迪思。
Judith.

444
00:27:47,045 --> 00:27:51,685
卡洛琳要全职工作还要独自抚养两个儿子。
So, Caroline was working full time and bringing up two boys on her own.

445
00:27:53,485 --> 00:27:57,845
然后他又大摇大摆地回来了，她让他进去了。
And then he just waltzes back in, and she lets him.

446
00:27:58,845 --> 00:28:00,604
你什么都不能说。
You can't say anything.

447
00:28:00,605 --> 00:28:04,564
不，吉莉安嫁的那个家伙，艾迪，他是个坏人。
No, the fella our Gillian was married to, Eddie, he was a wrong 'un.

448
00:28:04,565 --> 00:28:06,324
是他吗?
Was he?

449
00:28:06,325 --> 00:28:09,284
死了十年了，但他还是把她的头打穿了。
Dead ten years, but he still manages to do her head in.

450
00:28:09,285 --> 00:28:12,565
如何?哦。
How? Ooh.

451
00:28:14,565 --> 00:28:18,124
我说过他死于农场的一场事故?
You know I said he died in an accident on the farm?

452
00:28:18,125 --> 00:28:19,764
是吗?
Yeah?

453
00:28:19,765 --> 00:28:22,844
这不是意外。
Well, it wasn't an accident.

454
00:28:22,845 --> 00:28:25,084
他自杀了。
He killed himself.

455
00:28:25,085 --> 00:28:27,444
哦,不。不稳定。
Oh, no. Volatile.

456
00:28:27,445 --> 00:28:31,485
喝得太多了。总是缺钱。她非常喜欢他。
Drank too much. Always short of money. She thought the world of him.

457
00:28:32,565 --> 00:28:36,884
我能理解为什么人们会被他吸引，但我从来没有。
I could see why people were drawn to him, but I never was.

458
00:28:36,885 --> 00:28:39,405
他是个恶霸。是啊，还是个懦夫。
He was a bully. Yeah, and a coward.

459
00:28:41,405 --> 00:28:44,164
不过，他现在不在那里。
Still, he's not there now.

460
00:28:44,165 --> 00:28:46,604
所以…
So...

461
00:28:46,605 --> 00:28:49,164
但是小伙子不知道。
But the lad doesn't know.

462
00:28:49,165 --> 00:28:52,165
我们总是让他相信那是个意外。
We always let him believe that it was an accident.

463
00:28:53,765 --> 00:28:56,604
有人找你吗?呃…我,嗯…
You being seen to? Er... I, um...

464
00:28:56,605 --> 00:29:01,405
是的，我们想试驾一下这辆车，谢谢。
Yeah, we'd like to test-drive this car, please.

465
00:29:02,845 --> 00:29:06,365
什么,现在?呃…理想情况下,是的。
What, now? Er... ideally, yes.

466
00:29:08,645 --> 00:29:11,125
好的，是的。和…你想买吗?
Right, OK, yeah. And... and are you looking to buy?

467
00:29:11,126 --> 00:29:14,565
是的,th-that……这就是我的想法。
Yeah, th-that... that's the idea.

468
00:29:15,565 --> 00:29:20,245
这是部分交换吗?是的，是的，那个……这就是计划。
And is it part exchange? Yes, yes, that... that's the plan.

469
00:29:22,045 --> 00:29:24,564
好的，先生和太太……
OK, Mr and Mrs...

470
00:29:24,565 --> 00:29:27,005
你怎么知道我们结婚了?
What makes you think we're married?

471
00:29:30,645 --> 00:29:31,684
呃…
Er...

472
00:29:31,685 --> 00:29:33,885
噢!
Ow!

473
00:29:39,725 --> 00:29:41,044
正确的。
Right.

474
00:29:41,045 --> 00:29:43,205
来吧。
Come on.

475
00:29:44,205 --> 00:29:45,805
拍拍屁股走人。
Bugger off.

476
00:29:51,685 --> 00:29:54,485
是的。
Yeah.

477
00:29:56,725 --> 00:29:58,325
下次见。
Till next time.

478
00:30:11,405 --> 00:30:13,645
你笨蛋。
You twat.

479
00:30:15,765 --> 00:30:18,324
我认为昨天很不幸。
It was unfortunate yesterday, I think.

480
00:30:18,325 --> 00:30:21,924
我们的吉莉安和你的卡罗琳似乎一开始就不太对劲。
Our Gillian and your Caroline seemed to get off on the wrong foot.

481
00:30:21,925 --> 00:30:24,604
他认为我们浪费时间。
He thinks we're time-wasters.

482
00:30:24,605 --> 00:30:26,924
谁做?在那边。
Who does? Yond.

483
00:30:26,925 --> 00:30:30,604
如果我们搞点小活动，比如订婚……
Happen if we had a little do, like a little engagement...

484
00:30:30,605 --> 00:30:33,084
他们会被迫互相交谈。
Well, they'd be forced to speak to each other.

485
00:30:33,085 --> 00:30:34,485
他们会奋起应对。
They'd rise to the occasion.

486
00:30:34,486 --> 00:30:36,124
为什么不呢?
Well, why not?

487
00:30:36,125 --> 00:30:39,525
有个开派对的借口总是好的。
It's always nice to have an excuse for a party.

488
00:30:40,845 --> 00:30:43,044
我们为什么要浪费他的时间?
Why would we waste his time?

489
00:30:43,045 --> 00:30:46,204
他认为我们是一群愚蠢的老家伙，下午没别的事可做。
He thinks we're silly old buggers who've nothing better to do of an afternoon.

490
00:30:46,205 --> 00:30:48,524
我们应该邀请他。
Well, happen we should invite him.

491
00:30:48,525 --> 00:30:50,964
这样就能保证挥出正确的一杆了。
That'd guarantee it'd go with a right swing.

492
00:30:50,965 --> 00:30:53,765
他和他的脸。莎莉。
Him and his face. Ey up.

493
00:30:58,285 --> 00:31:01,484
那么，道森夫人……
So, Mrs Dawson...

494
00:31:01,485 --> 00:31:04,964
我和哈罗盖特的史蒂夫谈过，
I spoke to Steve in Harrogate,

495
00:31:04,965 --> 00:31:07,844
根据他告诉我的，减去损失的成本，
and based on what he's telling me, minus the cost of the damage,

496
00:31:07,845 --> 00:31:12,204
我们可以给你的a级车提供5500英镑的部分交货价，所以你想支付…
we can offer you 5,500 part-ex on your A-Class, so you'd be looking to pay...

497
00:31:12,205 --> 00:31:14,205
21500年。
21,500.

498
00:31:18,005 --> 00:31:19,525
21500年。
21,500.

499
00:31:20,525 --> 00:31:22,404
你还想试驾吗?
You still want a test-drive?

500
00:31:22,405 --> 00:31:25,405
每个是10750。
It's 10,750 each.

501
00:31:31,685 --> 00:31:33,045
视情况而定。
It depends.

502
00:31:35,325 --> 00:31:36,364
在什么?
On what?

503
00:31:36,365 --> 00:31:39,044
如果你能给我21美元的话。
On if you can give it to me for 21.

504
00:31:39,045 --> 00:31:42,244
如果你能在周六下午准备好。
And if you can have it ready for Saturday afternoon.

505
00:31:42,245 --> 00:31:44,325
只不过这是我们的订婚派对。
Only it's our engagement party.

506
00:31:48,205 --> 00:31:50,284
妈妈，你在哪里?
Mum, where are you?

507
00:31:50,285 --> 00:31:54,884
“你没事吧?”是的，我和艾伦在哈利法克斯。“什么?”
'Are you all right?' Yeah, I'm with Alan in Halifax. 'What?'

508
00:31:54,885 --> 00:31:58,844
你在哈利法克斯做什么?什么都没有。
What are you doing in Halifax? Nothing.

509
00:31:58,845 --> 00:32:01,805
你还好吗?是啊，再好不过了。
Are you all right? Yeah, never better.

510
00:32:04,765 --> 00:32:08,324
好吧，嗯……小心驾驶。
Right, well, er... drive carefully.

511
00:32:08,325 --> 00:32:12,284
是的，我会的。再见。再见。
Yeah, I will. Bye-bye. Bye.

512
00:32:12,285 --> 00:32:15,525
再见!
Bye-bye!

513
00:32:34,965 --> 00:32:37,844
我已经把水壶烧上了。我看见你停车了。
I've put the kettle on. I saw you pulling in.

514
00:32:37,845 --> 00:32:40,484
你好。你最近在忙什么?
Hello. What you been up to?

515
00:32:40,485 --> 00:32:43,164
嗯…什么都没有。
Um... nothing.

516
00:32:43,165 --> 00:32:45,565
嘿，你今天早上跟谁聊天来着?
Hey, who was that you were chatting to this morning?

517
00:32:45,566 --> 00:32:48,564
哦，保罗·贾特里。我做了一个蛋糕。
Oh, Paul Jatri. I made a cake.

518
00:32:48,565 --> 00:32:50,684
苏珊·贾特里的儿子?这是咖啡和核桃。
Oh, Susan Jatri's lad? It's coffee and walnut.

519
00:32:50,685 --> 00:32:51,964
是的。是的。
Yeah. Yeah.

520
00:32:51,965 --> 00:32:55,484
他不是要和尼尔·克雷斯韦尔的女朋友结婚吗?
Isn't he getting married to Neil Cresswell's girl?

521
00:32:55,485 --> 00:32:59,244
我想是的。哦，它看起来很可爱。
I believe so. Oh, it looks lovely.

522
00:32:59,245 --> 00:33:02,004
我们昨天一开始就误会了，西莉亚。
We got off on the wrong foot yesterday, Celia.

523
00:33:02,005 --> 00:33:04,804
我很抱歉。哦，不，亲爱的。这不是你的错。
I'm sorry. Oh, no, love. It wasn't your fault.

524
00:33:04,805 --> 00:33:09,484
不，我是说我和卡洛琳一开始就不太对劲。
No, I meant more me and Caroline got off on the wrong foot.

525
00:33:09,485 --> 00:33:11,404
我很抱歉。
And I'm sorry.

526
00:33:11,405 --> 00:33:14,804
我不该把车开进那个停车位，因为她在暗示，
I shouldn't have pulled into that parking space, because she was indicating,

527
00:33:14,805 --> 00:33:19,684
只有我……我很惊慌，想知道他，我爸爸是否还好……
only I... I was panicking, wondering if he, my dad, was all right and...

528
00:33:19,685 --> 00:33:23,444
也许你可以告诉她我很抱歉，我向她道歉
Perhaps you could tell her that I'm sorry and that I apologise

529
00:33:23,445 --> 00:33:28,524
显然，如果我们能把这事抛诸脑后就好了，
and obviously it'd be nice if we could put it behind us,

530
00:33:28,525 --> 00:33:31,924
考虑到……我当然会……是的。
given the... Of course I will. ..situation. Yeah.

531
00:33:31,925 --> 00:33:37,164
好。嘿，我们在考虑办个订婚派对。
Good. Hey, we were thinking about having, um, a little engagement do.

532
00:33:37,165 --> 00:33:38,964
太棒了!在哪里?在这里。
Great! Where? Here.

533
00:33:38,965 --> 00:33:41,204
星期六，这个星期六。
On Saturday, this Saturday.

534
00:33:41,205 --> 00:33:42,484
太棒了。
Fantastic.

535
00:33:42,485 --> 00:33:44,804
,看…
And, look...

536
00:33:44,805 --> 00:33:47,404
祝贺你。我昨天就该说了。
congratulations. I should have said it yesterday.

537
00:33:47,405 --> 00:33:49,445
但是，你知道，这只是…
But, you know, it was just...

538
00:33:50,405 --> 00:33:52,645
意想不到的。
so unexpected.

539
00:33:53,685 --> 00:33:55,685
我去拿……
I'll get the...

540
00:34:09,365 --> 00:34:11,885
安全驾驶。
Drive safely.

541
00:34:15,365 --> 00:34:18,405
你最近在忙什么呢?什么都没有。
So, what have you been up to? Nothing.

542
00:34:20,405 --> 00:34:22,445
我一直在想。
I've been thinking.

543
00:34:24,205 --> 00:34:26,444
我应该告诉拉夫……
Happen I ought to tell Raff...

544
00:34:26,445 --> 00:34:28,805
埃迪。
about Eddie.

545
00:34:30,165 --> 00:34:33,644
是时候了。然后他就知道了。
Happen it's time. And then he knows.

546
00:34:33,645 --> 00:34:36,004
我不会害怕的
And I won't be terrified

547
00:34:36,005 --> 00:34:39,285
他从别人那里听到了，就像听到了大锤一样。
about him hearing it, like a sledgehammer, from anyone else.

548
00:34:41,845 --> 00:34:43,884
怎么啦？
What?

549
00:34:43,885 --> 00:34:46,164
不。
No.

550
00:34:46,165 --> 00:34:47,725
我觉得你很聪明。
I think you're wise.

551
00:35:06,525 --> 00:35:10,204
我做饭。不是吧，夏洛克。
I'm cooking. No shit, Sherlock.

552
00:35:10,205 --> 00:35:14,164
如何……如何……检查人员怎么样了?
How... how... how were the inspectors?

553
00:35:14,165 --> 00:35:16,564
好。很好。
Good. Very good.

554
00:35:16,565 --> 00:35:18,524
好。他们理应如此。
Good. So they should be.

555
00:35:18,525 --> 00:35:20,565
你的历史论文写得怎么样?
How was your history paper?

556
00:35:22,445 --> 00:35:24,564
你没事吧?
You all right?

557
00:35:24,565 --> 00:35:26,764
是的。
Yup.

558
00:35:26,765 --> 00:35:30,604
现在，妈妈给大家带来了一些消息。怎么啦？
Now, Mum has got some news for everyone. What?

559
00:35:30,605 --> 00:35:34,604
有我吗?你没怀孕?哦，别傻了。我45岁。
Have I? You're not pregnant? Oh, don't be stupid. I'm 45.

560
00:35:34,605 --> 00:35:36,564
那么,什么呢?什么消息?
What, then? What news?

561
00:35:36,565 --> 00:35:39,484
西莉亚。哦，奶奶要结婚了。
Celia. Oh, Granny's getting married.

562
00:35:39,485 --> 00:35:41,564
如何?艾伦吗?谁?
How? To Alan? Who?

563
00:35:41,565 --> 00:35:44,245
显然。这不会发生的。
Apparently. It won't happen.

564
00:35:50,605 --> 00:35:53,364
不是意外?
Not an accident?

565
00:35:53,365 --> 00:35:55,565
验尸官也是这么说的。
That's what t'coroner said.

566
00:35:57,645 --> 00:35:59,565
他为什么……
Why did he...

567
00:36:02,925 --> 00:36:05,924
显然这是我想过的……
Obviously that's something I've thought about...

568
00:36:05,925 --> 00:36:06,965
很多。
a lot.

569
00:36:08,765 --> 00:36:11,164
但你知道吗?一天结束的时候，
But you know what? At the end of the day,

570
00:36:11,165 --> 00:36:14,204
你永远不知道为什么有人会走那么远。
you can never know why somebody gets that far down the line.

571
00:36:14,205 --> 00:36:16,245
如果他们不愿意说就不会。
Not if they won't talk about it.

572
00:36:18,165 --> 00:36:20,565
即使是你很亲近的人。
Even someone you're that close to.

573
00:36:21,525 --> 00:36:23,565
我们都有恶魔。
We all have demons.

574
00:36:26,885 --> 00:36:28,605
大多数人……
And most people...

575
00:36:29,605 --> 00:36:33,165
应付它们，忍受它们。
cope with them, put up with them.

576
00:36:35,445 --> 00:36:36,644
魔鬼?
Demons?

577
00:36:36,645 --> 00:36:39,325
我们自己不喜欢的事情。
Things about ourselves that we don't like.

578
00:36:41,045 --> 00:36:42,285
应付不了。
Can't cope with.

579
00:36:43,805 --> 00:36:45,245
我们做过的事。
Things we've done.

580
00:36:47,525 --> 00:36:49,125
我们的表现。
How we've behaved.

581
00:36:51,365 --> 00:36:54,005
你知道他脾气不好，而且…
Well, you know he had a temper and...

582
00:36:55,365 --> 00:37:00,565
他有很多优点，你爸爸，真的。
He had a lot of wonderful things about him, your dad, he really did.

583
00:37:02,005 --> 00:37:04,245
但他也有黑暗的一面……
But he had this darker side as well and...

584
00:37:07,325 --> 00:37:09,564
但是你不必担心。
But you mustn't worry about it.

585
00:37:09,565 --> 00:37:11,645
你和他不一样，在这方面不一样。
You're not like him, not in that respect.

586
00:37:12,645 --> 00:37:14,724
你更像我爸爸。
You're much more like my dad.

587
00:37:14,725 --> 00:37:16,765
你是善良的。
You're kind.

588
00:37:17,965 --> 00:37:19,005
深思熟虑的。
Thoughtful.

589
00:37:20,645 --> 00:37:21,685
平衡。
Balanced.

590
00:37:25,445 --> 00:37:26,685
你没事吧?
You all right?

591
00:37:35,165 --> 00:37:39,524
我不想让罗比告诉你。这是所有。
I didn't want you hearing it from Robbie. That's all.

592
00:37:39,525 --> 00:37:40,565
你看……
And, you see...

593
00:37:42,045 --> 00:37:45,605
这是罗比不愿意接受事实的另一个原因。
that's another reason Robbie doesn't like accepting what really happened.

594
00:37:46,965 --> 00:37:48,245
他把艾迪想得神魂颠倒。
He thought the world of Eddie.

595
00:37:49,685 --> 00:37:51,725
他的哥哥。
His big brother.

596
00:37:54,565 --> 00:37:56,045
艾迪把他丢下了。
And Eddie left him behind.

597
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:11,884
我们下周六有个小聚会。
We're having a little do next Saturday.

598
00:38:11,885 --> 00:38:14,764
你知道，就像订婚派对?
You know, like an engagement party?

599
00:38:14,765 --> 00:38:19,005
在吉莉安和艾伦家……农场。每个人都被邀请了。
At Gillian and Alan's house... farm. And everyone's invited.

600
00:38:22,805 --> 00:38:24,285
进来坐下。
Come in and sit down.

601
00:38:38,685 --> 00:38:41,125
你为什么这么急?
Why are you rushing into this?

602
00:38:42,205 --> 00:38:44,564
我猜你一定是这么想的。
I suppose that's what it must seem like to you.

603
00:38:44,565 --> 00:38:48,445
不然别人会怎么想呢?
Well, how else could it seem to anyone?

604
00:38:50,685 --> 00:38:53,524
我已经爱他60年了。
I've been in love with him for 60 years.

605
00:38:53,525 --> 00:38:56,284
这不是匆忙。
That's not rushing.

606
00:38:56,285 --> 00:38:58,964
你最后一次见他时他16岁。
He was 16 the last time you saw him.

607
00:38:58,965 --> 00:39:02,525
人……改变
People... alter.

608
00:39:03,725 --> 00:39:06,204
你怎么知道，只是在实践层面上…
How do you know, just on a practical level...

609
00:39:06,205 --> 00:39:08,684
毫米吗?．.比如说，他有多少钱?
Mm? ..how much money he's got, for instance?

610
00:39:08,685 --> 00:39:11,324
哦，他还不算穷。
Oh, he's not badly off.

611
00:39:11,325 --> 00:39:13,964
他有他工作的公司发给他的养老金。
He has a pension from the company that he worked for.

612
00:39:13,965 --> 00:39:17,885
他是哈德斯菲尔德杰索普化学公司的楼层经理。
He was a floor manager at Jessops Chemicals in Huddersfield.

613
00:39:19,805 --> 00:39:21,124
好,很好。
OK, good.

614
00:39:21,125 --> 00:39:24,684
他有自己的房子，他把房子出租，并从中获得收入。
He owns his own house, which he rents out and has an income from.

615
00:39:24,685 --> 00:39:27,684
他在农场里投了不少钱。
And he put quite a bit of money in the farm.

616
00:39:27,685 --> 00:39:30,085
他不矮。我不傻。哦，妈妈，我知道。
He's not short. I'm not daft. Oh, Mum, I know that.

617
00:39:30,086 --> 00:39:33,084
你从来没傻过。嗯,然后呢?
You've never been daft. Well, then?

618
00:39:33,085 --> 00:39:35,564
这就是我想要的。
Well, it's what I want.

619
00:39:35,565 --> 00:39:37,605
这是我一直想要的。
What I've always wanted.

620
00:39:39,445 --> 00:39:43,765
我比我自己还了解他。你能理解吗?
I know him better than I know myself. Can you understand that?

621
00:39:45,885 --> 00:39:46,925
嗯，算是吧。
Well, sort of.

622
00:39:48,685 --> 00:39:50,165
几乎。
Almost.

623
00:39:51,245 --> 00:39:53,284
这是非常…
That's very...

624
00:39:53,285 --> 00:39:55,524
怎么啦？
What?

625
00:39:55,525 --> 00:39:57,365
感人。
Touching.

626
00:39:58,925 --> 00:40:00,605
善于表达。
Articulate.

627
00:40:01,885 --> 00:40:06,204
想想看，如果我嫁给了他，而不是你爸爸，我会……
Just think, if I'd married him and not your dad, I'd have...

628
00:40:06,205 --> 00:40:07,525
没有我。
Not have had me.

629
00:40:10,165 --> 00:40:14,045
哦，我想我会的。我想我会一直拥有你。
Oh, I think I would. I think I'd always have had you.

630
00:40:15,725 --> 00:40:19,885
我只是在想，要是那样生活会幸福得多。
I was just thinking how much happier life would have been.

631
00:40:22,805 --> 00:40:25,964
吉莉安说她很抱歉你和她一开始就闹僵了，
Gillian says she's sorry that you and her got off on the wrong foot,

632
00:40:25,965 --> 00:40:28,885
她希望你们都能放下过去。
and she hopes you can both put it behind you.

633
00:40:30,525 --> 00:40:34,485
她很好，你知道的。心是对的。
She's all right, you know. Heart's in the right place.

634
00:40:35,845 --> 00:40:38,125
她也有事情要处理。
She's had things to deal with as well.

635
00:40:39,925 --> 00:40:41,685
还有谁?!
As well as who?!

636
00:40:43,885 --> 00:40:45,525
你，你这个笨蛋。
You, you twit.

637
00:41:00,845 --> 00:41:03,525
-准备好了吗?——嗯?
- Are you ready? - Hmm?

638
00:41:09,485 --> 00:41:11,964
我是……对不起。
I was... Sorry.

639
00:41:11,965 --> 00:41:16,604
我只是想知道，至于我在空房间里……
Just wondering, as regards me being in the spare room...

640
00:41:16,605 --> 00:41:19,164
等等。不是说……
and so forth. Not that...

641
00:41:19,165 --> 00:41:22,044
听着，我知道…我知道现在为时尚早
Look, I know... I know it's early days

642
00:41:22,045 --> 00:41:25,404
但是——显然，我并不是说我们应该……
but - and I'm not suggesting, obviously, that we should have...

643
00:41:25,405 --> 00:41:27,444
有……有……性?
have... have... Sex?

644
00:41:27,445 --> 00:41:28,884
然而。嗯,很好。
Yet. Well, good.

645
00:41:28,885 --> 00:41:31,004
没有,但是……
No, but...

646
00:41:31,005 --> 00:41:32,965
我做了一件蠢事。
I did this stupid thing.

647
00:41:34,245 --> 00:41:35,965
抱歉?
Sorry?

648
00:41:38,405 --> 00:41:40,764
我说了这句蠢话。
I said this stupid thing.

649
00:41:40,765 --> 00:41:43,765
当我遇到吉莉安时，我…
When I met Gillian, I...

650
00:41:44,725 --> 00:41:46,804
我不知道是吉莉安。
I didn't know it was Gillian.

651
00:41:46,805 --> 00:41:50,164
在艾伦介绍我们认识之前，我和她发生了口角
I had a sort of spat with her before Alan introduced us

652
00:41:50,165 --> 00:41:52,124
和我…怎么啦？你……
and I... What? What did you...

653
00:41:52,125 --> 00:41:54,005
我叫她白痴，然后我…
I called her an idiot and then I...

654
00:41:56,005 --> 00:41:58,285
我说她是脑残的拖车垃圾。
I called her brain-dead lowlife trailer trash.

655
00:41:59,565 --> 00:42:01,644
她抢了我的停车位。这一点都不好笑。
She stole my parking space. It wasn't funny.

656
00:42:01,645 --> 00:42:03,605
这就是我爱你的地方。你太…
That's what I love about you. You're so...

657
00:42:03,606 --> 00:42:07,204
怎么啦？又傲慢又光荣!
What? Snotty and arrogant and glorious!

658
00:42:07,205 --> 00:42:09,965
重点是，我一点也不期待这个派对。
The point is, I'm not looking forward to this party.

659
00:42:11,085 --> 00:42:13,644
你道歉了吗?不,我……
Did you apologise? No, I...

660
00:42:13,645 --> 00:42:16,724
她去厕所的时候跑掉了。
ran off when she went to the loo.

661
00:42:16,725 --> 00:42:20,564
事情从来没有你想的那么糟。
These things are never as bad as you think they are.

662
00:42:20,565 --> 00:42:22,964
不,这……是什么。
No, this... was.

663
00:42:22,965 --> 00:42:26,244
该死，我真希望我当时在场。我要向她道歉。
Damn, I wish I'd been there. I am going to apologise to her.

664
00:42:26,245 --> 00:42:28,805
那是成年人该做的事。
That would be the grown-up thing to do.

665
00:42:34,045 --> 00:42:35,844
也许……
Maybe...

666
00:42:35,845 --> 00:42:39,125
你可以开始…睡在这里……
you could start... sleeping in here...

667
00:42:40,645 --> 00:42:42,045
再一次。
again.

668
00:42:47,245 --> 00:42:49,925
今晚吗?还是……
Tonight? Or...

669
00:43:14,965 --> 00:43:17,203
我们在这里左转，就在这里。
So, we're turning left just here, just coming up.

670
00:43:17,204 --> 00:43:19,605
卫星导航显示还有六英里。
Well, the sat-nav's saying it's in another six miles.

671
00:43:19,606 --> 00:43:22,484
好吧，别在意那句话。你要往这边走。这里!
Yeah, well, take no notice of that. You want to go this way. Here!

672
00:43:22,485 --> 00:43:25,164
这,什么?是的。你确定吗?
What, this? Yes. Are you sure?

673
00:43:25,165 --> 00:43:26,964
艾伦总是这样来的。
This is the way Alan always comes.

674
00:43:26,965 --> 00:43:29,405
我想我还是按照卫星导航的指示去做吧。
I think I'd rather do what the sat-nav's telling me.

675
00:43:29,406 --> 00:43:32,884
不管卫星导航告诉你什么。就是这里。我告诉你。
Well, bugger what the sat-nav's telling you. This is it. I'm telling you.

676
00:43:32,885 --> 00:43:34,404
好的。
OK.

677
00:43:34,405 --> 00:43:36,804
我知道我在说什么。好。
I do know what I'm talking about. Good.

678
00:43:36,805 --> 00:43:40,124
只要我们走对路就行。我觉得不舒服。感觉不舒服还是要不舒服?
As long as we're going the right way. I feel sick. Feel sick or going to be sick?

679
00:43:40,125 --> 00:43:44,004
我要小便。约翰，座位后面的口袋里有个塑料袋。
I need a wee. John, there's plastic bag in the pocket at the back of the seat.

680
00:43:44,005 --> 00:43:46,844
你得再坚持一会儿。
You'll have to hang on for a wee.

681
00:43:46,845 --> 00:43:49,284
哦,狗屎!哦!妈妈，你能正常开车吗?
Oh, shit! Oh! Mum, can you drive properly?

682
00:43:49,285 --> 00:43:51,405
你说什么?我没开玩笑，我要吐了。
I beg your pardon? I'm not kidding, I'm throwing up.

683
00:43:51,406 --> 00:43:53,604
不要呕吐。没人需要呕吐。
Do not throw up. Nobody NEEDS to throw up.

684
00:43:53,605 --> 00:43:58,884
如果有人愿意找的话，口袋里有一个塑料袋!
There is a plastic bag in the pocket, if somebody chooses to look for it properly!

685
00:43:58,885 --> 00:44:01,365
爸爸为什么不开车?哦，是的，那会有帮助的!
Why doesn't Dad drive? Oh, yes, that'll help matters!

686
00:44:01,366 --> 00:44:04,444
我已经仔细找过了。你确定是这条路吗，西莉亚?
I have looked for it properly. Are you sure this is the right road, Celia?

687
00:44:04,445 --> 00:44:06,884
嗯…最好是这样。我只能说这么多。
Um... It had better be. That's all I can say.

688
00:44:06,885 --> 00:44:09,404
哦，我想……哦……你找到那个包了吗?
Oh, I think... Oh... Have you found that bag?

689
00:44:09,405 --> 00:44:10,805
没有袋子。有一个袋子!
There is no bag. There is a bag!

690
00:44:10,806 --> 00:44:13,164
总有一个袋子!去越野吧，妈妈。
There is always a bag! Go off-road, Mum.

691
00:44:13,165 --> 00:44:15,964
-调成四轮驱动。-不，妈妈，不要。
- Put it into four-wheel drive. - No, Mum, don't.

692
00:44:15,965 --> 00:44:18,044
我不会去越野的。
I am not going off-road.

693
00:44:18,045 --> 00:44:19,925
你知道怎么把它调成四轮驱动吗?
Do you know how to put it in four-wheel drive?

694
00:44:19,926 --> 00:44:21,964
我当然知道怎么开四轮驱动。
Course I know how to put it in four-wheel drive.

695
00:44:21,965 --> 00:44:24,484
她看起来像吗?她从不需要四轮驱动。
Does she heck as like! She never needs four-wheel drive.

696
00:44:24,485 --> 00:44:25,963
她买的时候我就告诉她了。
I told her when she bought it.

697
00:44:25,964 --> 00:44:28,125
是啊，我现在得到这份工作真是太好了，不是吗?
Yeah, well, it's a good job I've got it now, isn't it?

698
00:44:29,565 --> 00:44:30,885
我们到底在哪儿，妈妈?
Where the hell are we, Mother?

699
00:44:30,886 --> 00:44:34,325
我只是想找到我认识的东西。耶稣。
I'm just trying to find something I recognise. Jesus.

700
00:44:35,325 --> 00:44:37,804
我们能放点音乐吗?不。
Can we have some music on? No.

701
00:44:37,805 --> 00:44:40,244
让我们唱歌。我们不用麻烦了。
Let's sing. Let's not bother.

702
00:44:40,245 --> 00:44:41,563
哦，她变得暴躁了。
Ooh, she's getting stroppy.

703
00:44:41,564 --> 00:44:42,923
你马上就可以出来了。是啊，闭嘴。
You'll be getting out in a minute. Yeah, shut up.

704
00:44:42,924 --> 00:44:44,525
你闭嘴。你们两个，闭嘴。
You shut up. Both of you, shut up.

705
00:44:44,526 --> 00:44:47,685
别叫我闭嘴。混蛋。
Don't you tell me to shut up. Bastard.

706
00:44:48,885 --> 00:44:51,085
呃…停车!
Er... stop the car!

707
00:45:21,325 --> 00:45:23,324
他们在这里!
They're here!

708
00:45:23,325 --> 00:45:25,245
废料!
Raff!

709
00:45:26,485 --> 00:45:27,645
废料!
Raff!

710
00:45:30,165 --> 00:45:32,924
哦!你的脸怎么了?
Oh! What have you done to your face?

711
00:45:32,925 --> 00:45:35,324
什么都没有。我摔倒了。什么时候?
Nothing. I fell over. When?

712

昨晚在黑暗中从奥吉家回来。

好吧，我们走吧?确定。

很抱歉我失礼了。
I'm so sorry I was rude.

732
00:46:23,765 --> 00:46:27,764
那是，呃……不可原谅和不必要的，
It was, er... inexcusable and unnecessary,

733
00:46:27,765 --> 00:46:30,324
我很抱歉。
and I am sorry.

734
00:46:30,325 --> 00:46:34,004
你很担心你妈妈。我知道。我…我很担心他。
You were worried about your mother. I know. I... I was worried about him.

我也很抱歉。这太美了!
I'm sorry too. This is beautiful!

736
00:46:38,365 --> 00:46:43,324
是的，我们很幸运。我有时勉强维持生计，但我不会拿它换。
Yeah, we're lucky. I struggle to make ends meet sometimes, but I wouldn't swap it.

737
00:46:43,325 --> 00:46:46,084
你想进来吗?我们已经把水壶烧好了。
Do you want to come in? We've got the kettle on.

745
00:47:01,845 --> 00:47:05,324
我,呃……我准备了一些东西。
I've, er... I've prepared a little bit of something.

746
00:47:05,325 --> 00:47:08,244
我想艾伦要做个简短的演讲了。
Ooh, I think Alan's going to make a little speech.

747
00:47:08,245 --> 00:47:10,364
演讲!演讲!
Speech! Speech!

748
00:47:10,365 --> 00:47:13,444
闭嘴，噪音盒子。是他，不是你。
Shut up, noise-boxes. Him, not you.

749
00:47:13,445 --> 00:47:15,004
-为什么是我?——嗯…
- Why me? - Well...

750
00:47:15,005 --> 00:47:16,445
孩子们!
Boys!

751
00:47:17,685 --> 00:47:20,604
继续，爸爸。呃…谢谢你！
Go on, Dad. Er... thank you.

752
00:47:20,605 --> 00:47:24,324
好吧，嗯…我…我…
OK, well, um... I... I...

753
00:47:24,325 --> 00:47:28,044
首先，我想说谢谢你……每一个人,
First of all, I'd like to say thank you for... everyone,

754
00:47:28,045 --> 00:47:35,644
谢谢你来…和我们一起庆祝这个…这是一个非常快乐和不寻常的事件。
for coming to, er... celebrate with us this... this very happy and unusual event.

755
00:47:35,645 --> 00:47:38,564
呃…我们……我们还没有定好日期。
Er... we... we've not fixed a date yet.

756
00:47:38,565 --> 00:47:42,444
和,呃……我们不知道我们可能住在哪里。
And, er... we haven't a clue where we might live.

757
00:47:42,445 --> 00:47:45,324
但我们会随时通知你的。哦!
But we'll keep you posted. Aw!

758
00:47:45,325 --> 00:47:50,164
是的。所以…嗯…我只是想……
Yeah. So... Um... I'd just like to...

759
00:47:50,165 --> 00:47:53,924
澄清。呃…
clarify. Er...

760
00:47:53,925 --> 00:47:56,524
我…我知道你觉得我们很愚蠢。
I...I know you think we're daft.

761
00:47:56,525 --> 00:47:58,884
我们没有!没人觉得你傻。
We do not! Nobody thinks you're daft.

762
00:47:58,885 --> 00:48:03,925
不。那就冲进去吧。但是,呃…西莉亚和我……
No. Well, rushing in, then. But, er... Celia and I...

763
00:48:05,925 --> 00:48:11,164
事情是这样的，我站在桥上等她，因为我们约好了。
What happened was, I was stood on a bridge waiting for her, cos we had a date.

764
00:48:11,165 --> 00:48:14,684
这是，呃……60年前，呃……埃兰。
This is, er...60 years ago, er... in Elland.

765
00:48:14,685 --> 00:48:19,444
而且，你知道，这是在我们没有电话之前。
And, you know, this is before we had telephones.

766
00:48:19,445 --> 00:48:23,444
她妈妈把她的约会对象搞错了，他们已经飞去谢菲尔德了
And her mother had mixed her dates up and they were already flitted to Sheffield

767
00:48:23,445 --> 00:48:29,444
西莉亚联系不上我，所以她…发了一条信息，
and Celia couldn't contact me so she, er... sent a message,

768
00:48:29,445 --> 00:48:31,405
一封通过……
a letter via...

769
00:48:32,605 --> 00:48:33,964
一个朋友,
a friend,

770
00:48:33,965 --> 00:48:36,644
嗯…说对不起，
um... to say sorry,

771
00:48:36,645 --> 00:48:38,924
我可以给她写个新地址，
with a new address that I could write to her,

772
00:48:38,925 --> 00:48:42,644
但我……我一直没收到留言。
but I... I never got the message.

773
00:48:42,645 --> 00:48:44,484
所以,嗯…
So, um...

774
00:48:44,485 --> 00:48:45,804
为什么?
Why?

775
00:48:45,805 --> 00:48:49,244
因为不是她给我的。
Well, cos she didn't give it to me.

776
00:48:49,245 --> 00:48:50,764
的朋友吗?
The friend?

777
00:48:50,765 --> 00:48:53,044
-是的。——为什么?
- Yeah. - Why?

778
00:48:53,045 --> 00:48:55,844
只是因为…
Just cos...

779
00:48:55,845 --> 00:48:57,364
肮脏的伎俩。
Nasty trick.

780
00:48:57,365 --> 00:49:00,484
嗯,嗯……她是谁?
Mm, well... Who was she?

781
00:49:00,485 --> 00:49:02,965
我们……我们会找到她的照片，然后把它扔进去。
We... we'll find a picture of her and chuck darts at it.

782
00:49:07,485 --> 00:49:09,085
是艾琳。
It were Eileen.

783
00:49:12,045 --> 00:49:13,524
我的母亲吗?
My mother?

784
00:49:13,525 --> 00:49:15,644
是的。
Yeah.

785
00:49:15,645 --> 00:49:17,364
所以,无论如何。
So, anyway.

786
00:49:17,365 --> 00:49:22,325
不是说……并不是说任何人都想改变过去的一切。
Not that... not that anybody wants to change what's gone.

787
00:49:23,325 --> 00:49:27,365
但这只是为了说明我们并不急于求成。
But it's just to illustrate the fact that we're not rushing in.

788
00:49:28,445 --> 00:49:30,964
我们一直都很…
We've always had very...

789
00:49:30,965 --> 00:49:33,885
彼此之间的感情很好……
very fond feelings for one another...

790
00:49:35,365 --> 00:49:36,885
从很久以前开始…
since all that time ago and...

791
00:49:38,245 --> 00:49:40,165
嗯，什么都没变。
well, nothing's changed.

792
00:49:41,725 --> 00:49:43,004
所以…
So...

793
00:49:43,005 --> 00:49:45,524
这是……上帝,这是……
That's... God, that's...

794
00:49:45,525 --> 00:49:47,444
哇。
Wow.

795
00:49:47,445 --> 00:49:49,524
这是所以…
That's so...

796
00:49:49,525 --> 00:49:51,804
神。
God.

797
00:49:51,805 --> 00:49:54,205
不管怎样，对我们来说。
Anyroad, to us.

798
00:49:55,245 --> 00:49:56,285
给我们。
To us.

799
00:49:59,165 --> 00:50:00,444
妈妈!
Mum!

800
00:50:00,445 --> 00:50:03,364
外面停了一辆巨大的红色跑车。
There's a massive red sports car just pulled up outside.

801
00:50:03,365 --> 00:50:05,484
看起来大概花了两百万英镑。
Looks like it cost about two million quid.

802
00:50:05,485 --> 00:50:06,925
哦，是我们。
Oh, that's us.

803
00:50:10,005 --> 00:50:13,444
我们决定不买订婚戒指。
We decided against an engagement ring.

804
00:50:13,445 --> 00:50:17,044
所以我们俩一起买了辆车。
So instead we bought a car between us.

805
00:50:17,045 --> 00:50:19,644
我们一直喜欢的那种!
The sort we've always fancied!

806
00:50:19,645 --> 00:50:20,925
——是的!——Whoa-ho !
- Yes! - Whoa-ho!

807
00:50:20,926 --> 00:50:22,164
快看!
Look at that!

808
00:50:22,165 --> 00:50:23,564
哦!
Oh!

809
00:50:23,565 --> 00:50:26,445
哦!噢,瞧!哦!
Oh! Oh, look! Oh!

810
00:50:28,085 --> 00:50:30,004
奶奶!
Grandma!

811
00:50:30,005 --> 00:50:31,644
你知道这件事吗?
Did you know about this?

812
00:50:31,645 --> 00:50:33,565
哦!不。
Oh! No.

813
00:50:35,245 --> 00:50:37,604
哦!美丽。
Oh! Beautiful.

814
00:50:37,605 --> 00:50:39,365
哦!
Oh!

815
00:50:42,925 --> 00:50:45,284
Buttershaw先生。道森太太。
Mr Buttershaw. Mrs Dawson.

816
00:50:45,285 --> 00:50:48,044
哦!爷爷，我们能坐在里面吗?
Oh! Can we sit in it, Granddad?

817
00:50:48,045 --> 00:50:49,884
嗯…是的，当然可以。
Well... Yes, of course you can.

818
00:50:49,885 --> 00:50:52,724
只要他们小心点。祝贺你。
As long as they're careful. Congratulations.

819
00:50:52,725 --> 00:50:54,964
惊人的!哇!
Stunning! Wow!

820
00:50:54,965 --> 00:50:58,244
所以,你……这不是订婚戒指吗?
So, you... This is instead of an engagement ring?

821
00:50:58,245 --> 00:50:59,484
毫米。
Mm.

822
00:50:59,485 --> 00:51:01,964
但你没有让艾伦为整件事买单吗?
But you didn't let Alan pay for the whole thing?

823
00:51:01,965 --> 00:51:05,564
不，我是说我们私下买的。希望他们没把泥拖进去。
No, I said we bought it between us. Hope they're not trailing mud in.

824
00:51:05,565 --> 00:51:08,085
所以…啊呀!
So... Blimey!

825
00:51:09,565 --> 00:51:12,804
那要花多少钱呢，爸爸?是的,足够了。
How much did it cost, then, Dad? Yeah, enough.

826
00:51:12,805 --> 00:51:15,044
澄清一下，你不知道什么时候，
So, just to clarify, you don't know when,

827
00:51:15,045 --> 00:51:18,764
或者，老实说，如果你打算结婚，但你刚刚花了……
or, let's be honest, if you're going to get married, but you've just spent...

828
00:51:18,765 --> 00:51:20,445
没有如果……花这么多钱买车
There is no if. ..silly money buying a car

829
00:51:20,446 --> 00:51:23,084
你需要一个髋关节置换术才能进出。
that you're going to need a hip replacement to get in and out of.

830
00:51:23,085 --> 00:51:24,804
哦，别这么消极。
Oh, stop being so negative.

831
00:51:24,805 --> 00:51:27,604
你喜欢吗?是的,是的。
Do you like it? Yeah, yeah.

832
00:51:27,605 --> 00:51:30,964
我想我妈妈可能会喜欢所有的，爸爸。
I think my mother probably would have liked one and all, Dad.

833
00:51:30,965 --> 00:51:34,125
现在怎么办呢?
Now what?

834
00:51:39,645 --> 00:51:42,324
下午。如何?
Afternoon. How do?

835
00:51:42,325 --> 00:51:43,445
他们是脱衣舞娘吗?
Are they the strippers?

836
00:51:43,446 --> 00:51:45,564
阻止它。
Stop it.

837
00:51:45,565 --> 00:51:48,804
漂亮的车。你想要什么?吉莉安。
Nice car. What do you want? Gillian.

838
00:51:48,805 --> 00:51:50,964
有总结吗?
Is there summat up?

839
00:51:50,965 --> 00:51:53,325
我只需要和拉菲聊几句，就这样。
Just need to have a little chat with Raffy, that's all.

840
00:51:53,326 --> 00:51:55,604
对什么?你的脸怎么了?
What for? What have you done to your face?

841
00:51:55,605 --> 00:51:57,565
他摔倒了。在哪里?
He fell over. Where?

842
00:51:58,845 --> 00:52:01,765
Ripponden。你认识保罗·贾特里吗?
Down Ripponden. Do you know a Paul Jatri?

843
00:52:03,765 --> 00:52:05,604
不。
No.

844
00:52:05,605 --> 00:52:07,444
他认为他认识你。
Well, he reckons he knows you.

845
00:52:07,445 --> 00:52:10,044
他说你昨晚袭击了他。
He's been in saying that you assaulted him last night.

846
00:52:10,045 --> 00:52:12,964
是吗?他不该说那些话的，对吧?
Yeah? Well, he shouldn't have been saying stuff, should he?

847
00:52:12,965 --> 00:52:15,285
什么东西?
What stuff?

848
00:52:16,845 --> 00:52:19,044
我以涉嫌袭击罪逮捕你。
I'm arresting you on suspicion of assault.

849
00:52:19,045 --> 00:52:20,885
你不是!你什么都不用说
You're not! You don't have to say anything,

850
00:52:20,886 --> 00:52:23,644
但如果你在被询问时不提，可能不利于你的辩护
but it may harm your defence if you don't mention when questioned

851
00:52:23,645 --> 00:52:25,403
你以后在法庭上会用到的东西。
something you later rely on in court.

852
00:52:25,404 --> 00:52:26,885
你不能逮捕他。
You're not arresting him.

853
00:52:26,886 --> 00:52:29,164
他侵犯了某人。他是你的侄子。
He's assaulted someone. He's your nephew.

854
00:52:29,165 --> 00:52:31,005
这只是一个小小的警告，仅此而已。
It'll just be a bit of a caution, that's all.

855
00:52:31,006 --> 00:52:33,764
哈特菲尔德探长要跟你说几句话。
Inspector Hatfield'll just need to have a bit of a word with you.

856
00:52:33,765 --> 00:52:35,844
提醒一下?是的。
A bit of a caution? Yeah.

857
00:52:35,845 --> 00:52:38,604
如果他被激怒了，听起来确实如此。
If he was provoked, which it sounds like he was.

858
00:52:38,605 --> 00:52:41,284
看,也许……我们应该…
Look, perhaps... should we...

859
00:52:41,285 --> 00:52:43,524
我们该下车了吗?不。
should we be getting off? No.

860
00:52:43,525 --> 00:52:47,244
不，不，不。看，这是西莉亚和艾伦的小派对。我们不能这样。
No, no, no. Look, look, this is Celia and Alan's little party. We can't have this.

861
00:52:47,245 --> 00:52:48,604
我们不能就这么走了。
We can't just take off.

862
00:52:48,605 --> 00:52:50,644
问题是，警官，
The thing is, Officer,

863
00:52:50,645 --> 00:52:53,844
呃…这位女士和这位先生……
er... this lady and this gentleman...

864
00:52:53,845 --> 00:52:56,724
有人让他闭嘴。刚刚订婚，即将结婚，
Someone shut him up. ..have just got engaged to be married,

865
00:52:56,725 --> 00:52:59,404
说真的，这件事不能等一等吗?
and, really, couldn't this wait?

866
00:52:59,405 --> 00:53:01,444
祝贺你,艾伦。是的,谢谢。
Congratulations, Alan. Yeah, thanks.

867
00:53:01,445 --> 00:53:03,444
来吧，小伙子，让我们快点结束。
Come on, lad, let's get this over with.

868
00:53:03,445 --> 00:53:06,484
不，这真的，我想说，太粗暴了。你是谁?
No, this is really, I would say, rather heavy-handed. And you are?

869
00:53:06,485 --> 00:53:09,525
我…我…一个卑鄙的人。
I'm... I'm... A wanker.

870
00:53:12,765 --> 00:53:14,605
他是。他在我们家搞过那个婊子。
He is. He's had that bitch in our house.

871
00:53:14,606 --> 00:53:16,484
什么……婊子?
What... bitch?

872
00:53:16,485 --> 00:53:18,724
朱迪思。
Judith.

873
00:53:18,725 --> 00:53:21,764
上周二考试结束后，我下午三点左右回到家，
I came home mid-afternoon last Tuesday after my exam,

874
00:53:21,765 --> 00:53:24,245
他们在客厅里一起喝醉了。
and they were pissed together in the sitting room.

875
00:53:34,125 --> 00:53:37,644
废料,呃……你和Robbie一起去。我开着路虎跟着你。
Raff, er... you go with Robbie. I'll follow you on in the Land Rover.

876
00:53:37,645 --> 00:53:39,525
我得和他一起去。很好。
I'm going to have to go with him. Fair enough.

877
00:53:39,526 --> 00:53:42,605
你就不能让我们搭你的车去主干道吗?是的,不管。收割
You couldn't give us a lift down to the main road? Yeah, whatever. Get in.

878
00:53:45,525 --> 00:53:47,324
在我家里?!
In my house?!

879
00:53:47,325 --> 00:53:49,404
不是你想的那样。
Not what you think.

880
00:53:49,405 --> 00:53:51,045
我应该和吉莉安一起去趟警察局。
Happen I ought to pop down to the police station with Gillian.

881
00:53:51,046 --> 00:53:54,204
是的，你最好。我们不要毁了这一切……真的，真的很可爱……
Yes, you'd better. Let's not ruin this... really, really lovely...

882
00:53:54,205 --> 00:53:56,644
以雷克萨斯为例。要我吗?你不介意吧?
Take the Lexus. Shall I? You don't mind?

883
00:53:56,645 --> 00:54:01,724
快上车，孩子们。妈妈，我们要走了。
Get in the car, boys. Mum, we're leaving.

884
00:54:01,725 --> 00:54:06,724
做得很好。别再回来了。
Well done. Don't come back.

885
00:54:06,725 --> 00:54:09,204
你还没听我说呢。
You haven't even heard my side of it.

886
00:54:09,205 --> 00:54:12,684
这被断章取义了，不成比例了，什么都没发生!
This has been taken out of context, out of proportion, and nothing happened!

887
00:54:12,685 --> 00:54:15,525
卡洛琳，你不能把我丢在这里!
Caroline, you are not leaving me here!

888
00:54:19,165 --> 00:54:20,644
哦!
Oh!

889
00:54:20,645 --> 00:54:23,925
这么多年来我一直想这么做。
I've wanted to do that for years.

890
00:54:52,325 --> 00:54:55,924
有一次我差点杀了他。我是说，字面上，我可以有k…
I could have killed him one time. I mean, literally, I could have k...

891
00:54:55,925 --> 00:55:00,684
我只是想让你明白你对我的影响。
I just want you to understand the effect you have on me.

892
00:55:00,685 --> 00:55:05,324
啊!他们说要往我身上倒汽油，然后把我点着。
Aaah! They said they was going to pour petrol over me and set me on fire.

893
00:55:05,325 --> 00:55:08,244
哦!这段婚姻结束了!
Oh! This marriage is over!

894
00:55:08,245 --> 00:55:10,364
我不想再浪费一个…你婊子!
And I do not want to waste another... You bitch!

895
00:55:10,365 --> 00:55:13,084
我花了这么多时间假装这是值得拯救的东西!
Second of my life pretending it's something worth saving!

896
00:55:13,085 --> 00:55:14,485
妈妈!哦!
Mum! Oh!

897
00:55:16,165 --> 00:55:19,444
你好!有人在吗?
Hello! Is anybody there?

898
00:55:19,445 --> 00:55:22,325
飞片。是的,不管。
Slapper. Yeah, whatever.

899
00:55:22,403 --> 00:55:42,549
