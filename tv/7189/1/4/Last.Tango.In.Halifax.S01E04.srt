1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,360
你还好吗?我只是心脏有问题。
Are you all right? I just have a heart condition.

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,440
如果你给我打电话，我就跑过来，即使我知道你不是真的感兴趣。
If you ring me, I'll run round here even though I know you're not really interested.

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,000
“我不是不感兴趣。”
'I'm not NOT interested.'

4
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:12,320
拉夫?“我想他已经明白了，知道了什么。”
Raff? 'I assume he's seen the light, worked out what'

5
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:16,760
你真是个疯婆子。如果他想搬来住，我没意见。
a mad bitch you are. If he wants to move in here, that's fine by me.

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,960
你竟敢向他灌输我的坏话。
Don't you dare fill his head with rubbish about me.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,400
这段婚姻结束了，我不想再浪费另一段…愚蠢的母狗!
This marriage is over and I do not want to waste another... Silly bitch!

8
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:27,720
．.我花了这么多时间假装这是值得拯救的东西!
..second of my life pretending it's something worth saving!

9
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,000
他叹息着说
HE GROANS

10
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:31,840
他在这里做什么?他没有别的地方可去。
What's he doing here? He's got nowhere else to go.

11
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:34,640
你想要什么?你不能借给我一些钱，是吗?
What do you want? You couldn't lend me some money, could you?

12
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:38,440
你想在哪里结婚?你知道，现在你可以在任何地方结婚。
Where would you like to get wed? You can get wed anywhere now, you know.

13
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,720
喂?有人在吗?
Hello? Is anybody there?

14
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,280
哦,不!
Oh, no!

15
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:34,720
雷声隆隆，大雨倾盆
THUNDER RUMBLES RAIN POURS

16
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:37,440
现在都安全了。你为什么不回到暖和的地方去呢?
It's all safe now. Why don't you get back in t'warm?

17
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:40,040
我们要下车了。再见。谢谢。
We'll get off. Bye. Thanks.

18
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,680
雷声不断
THUNDER CONTINUES

19
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:00,520
“你好，我是艾伦·巴特肖。请在哔声后留言。”
'Hello, this is Alan Buttershaw. Please leave your message after the tone.'

20
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,840
哔哔的声音
BEEP

21
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:05,320
爸爸，是我……再说一遍，只是想说……
Dad, it's me...again, just to say...

22
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,720
她叹了口气
SHE SIGHS

23
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:12,080
…你在哪里，你收到我最后一条短信了吗，
...where are you, basically, and did you get my last message,

24
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,920
叫外卖吗?因为……
about picking up a takeaway? Cos...

25
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:18,240
发生了这么多事，我都没时间考虑做饭了。
I've not been able to think about cooking with all this going on.

26
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,400
她叹了口气
SHE SIGHS

27
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,480
再见。
Bye.

28
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,200
我真不想现在发生这种事。
I so didn't need this happening right now.

29
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,760
你得打电话给你的保险公司。
You'll have to ring your insurance.

30
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,360
他们会给我50英镑。
They'll give me about 50 quid for it.

31
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,000
我怎么能再买一个呢?
How the hell am I going to buy another one?

32
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,400
你可以用我的车。
You can use my car.

33
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,440
谢谢。
Thanks.

34
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:38,640
是怎么开始的?哦，他们不知道——闪电……电气故障……
How'd it start? Oh, they don't know - lightning...electrical fault...

35
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,160
你不会认为有人把它烧了吧?
You don't think someone torched it?

36
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,640
像谁?
Like who?

37
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,040
Cresswells。海莉愚蠢的兄弟们。
Cresswells. Hailey's stupid brothers.

38
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,960
我希望我爸爸能回家。
I wish me dad would get home.

39
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:55,160
他们应该一个多小时前就到了。
They should've been here over an hour since.

40
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,000
噢!
Ooh!

41
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,360
你知道吗，我的牌很烂。
D'you know, I've had some poor cards.

42
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,560
风呼啸着，门开了
WIND HOWLS DOOR OPENS

43
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,040
哦，她又来了。
Oh, there she goes again.

44
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,360
#用她的头…
# With her 'ead...

45
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,560
西莉亚加入:#…蜷缩在她的手臂下
CELIA JOINS IN: # ...tucked underneath her arm

46
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:22,400
她走在该死的塔上!＃
# She walks the bloody tower! #

47
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,920
我们在这里，亲爱的!
We're in here, love!

48
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,040
你说得对，这是一种抽风。
You're right, it'll be a draught.

49
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:36,320
这么大这么老的房子，如果不咯吱咯吱地响才怪呢。
House this size, this old, it'd be odd if it didn't creak and make a few noises.

50
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,920
打完这手，我们再去趟厕所好吗?
Shall we make another expedition to t'water closet after this hand?

51
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,560
嗯，没问题。
Mmm, can do.

52
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:45,280
我不知道接待处的电话为什么坏了。
I don't know why that telephone at reception won't work.

53
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:48,240
这显然是有联系的。
It's obviously connected.

54
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,600
我很惊讶我们居然没有拉响警报。
I'm amazed we've not set off an alarm.

55
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:00,760
你觉得有人发现我们失踪了吗?
D'you think anyone's realised that we're missing?

56
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,040
门打开
DOOR OPENS

57
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:15,680
约翰:她就在这儿，就在这儿，让我问问她。卡洛琳……
JOHN: She's just here, just now, let me ask her. Caroline...

58
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,840
这是怎么回事?爸爸的烹饪。
What's all this mess? Dad's cooking.

59
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,760
你考试考得怎么样?好的……伊什。
How was your exam? Good...ish.

60
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,840
回答一切吗?
Answered everything?

61
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,240
嗯。没有令人不快的惊喜吗?
Mmm. No nasty surprises?

62
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,920
卡洛琳，我是吉莉安。谁?
Caroline, it's Gillian. Who?

63
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:29,000
有点担心，因为她以为你妈妈和艾伦
Slightly concerned cos she was under the impression your mum and Alan

64
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,800
我们该去她家了，可他们还没来。
were due at hers and they've not turned up.

65
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,600
所以呢?他们是成年人。
So? They're adults.

66
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,640
是的，但她本来是五点钟来的。
Yes, but she was expecting them at five.

67
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,400
她在给他们做饭，而且…
She's cooking for them, and...

68
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,120
你想和她谈谈吗?
Do you want to talk to her?

69
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,000
吉莉安,你好!
Gillian, hi!

70
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,840
我打电话只是想看看他们是不是和你在一起，仅此而已。
I was just ringing to see if they were with you, that's all.

71
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,960
不，他们的车不在这里。他们不在这里，我刚看过。
Er, no, their car's not here. They're not here, I just looked.

72
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,520
我知道他们要马上离开这里。
I got the idea they were leaving here first thing.

73
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,680
是的，我知道。我…
They did, I know. I...

74
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:58,840
我只是想知道他们是不是因为什么原因回哈罗盖特了。
I just wondered if they'd gone back to Harrogate for whatever reason.

75
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,280
我不这么想。
I don't think so.

76
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,760
你妈妈有手机吗?
Has your mum got a mobile?

77
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,320
是的。你能帮我给她打个电话吗?
Yes. Would you mind ringing her for me?

78
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,880
我不介意他们迟到，只要他们没事就行。
I don't mind 'em being late just so long as they're all right.

79
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,560
确定。我一会儿打给你，给我一分钟。
Sure. I'll get back to you, give me a minute.

80
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,400
谢谢你！“再见。”
Thank you. 'Bye.'

81
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,440
再见。
Bye-bye.

82
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,440
她为什么打你手机?为什么?嗯…
Why is she ringing you on your mobile? Why? Well...

83
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:21,920
“你好，我是西莉亚……”嘘!“……道森。请留言。”
'Hello, this is Celia...' Shush! '..Dawson. Please leave a message.'

84
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,400
“谢谢你。”
'Thank you.'

85
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,640
嗨，妈妈，是我。
Hi, Mum, it's me.

86
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:27,760
听到留言后，请给我打个电话好吗?谢谢你！再见。
Can you give me a ring when you get this message, please? Thank you. Bye.

87
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:31,720
我需要吉莉安的电话。
I, er, need Gillian's number.

88
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:38,000
07700 900 827。
07700 900 827.

89
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:43,080
我给她打了个电话，谢谢你让我住在她家，因为你开车走了，没带我。
I rang her to say thank you for letting me stay at her house after you drove off without me.

90
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,400
艾伦开车送我过来的时候我跟他要了她的电话。
I got her number from Alan when he drove me over here.

91
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,600
而你拯救了它。
And you saved it.

92
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:50,360
嗯，是的，不，不，不……你是透明的。
Well, yes, not, not, not... You're transparent.

93
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,120
“你好吗?”
'Hello?'

94
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,440
吉莉安,嗨。我刚收到语音留言。
Gillian, hi. I'm just getting voice mail.

95
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:57,080
“好吧。”我肯定他们会来的。
'OK.' I'm sure they'll turn up.

96
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,120
我只是担心我爸身上带着药，你知道…
I just worry about me dad having his pills on him, you know...

97
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,280
．.为了他的心脏。
..for his heart.

98
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,280
哦，天啊，当然了。
Oh, God, yeah, of course.

99
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:08,520
如果他知道自己要迟到了，他是不会不打电话的。
'And he wouldn't not ring if he knew he was going to be late,

100
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,360
“当他知道我在给他们做饭的时候。”
'when he knew I was cooking for 'em.'

101
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,480
他只是……
He's just...

102
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:15,480
他很有礼貌，很体贴。
He's polite, he's thoughtful.

103
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,760
他有没有他们可能拜访过的朋友或亲戚?
Has he any friends or relatives they might have visited?

104
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,720
是的。是啊，我只是想先试试你。
Yeah. Yeah, I just thought I'd try you first.

105
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,400
我会继续打她的电话。
I'll keep trying her number.

106
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,640
谢谢。
Thanks.

107
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,640
“你能给我打电话吗?”课程。
'Will you ring me?' Course.

108
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,480
好吧,再见。他们可能只是被冲昏了头脑
OK, bye. They've probably just got carried away

109
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,680
做一些事情，忘记看时钟。
doing something and forgotten to look at the clock.

110
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,920
是的,不管。我做饭。
Yeah, whatever. I'm cooking.

111
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,600
对我来说不是。我不要你的脏东西。
Not for me. I don't want your filth.

112
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:40,040
你看，那只是…我有一个时间表。我知道我在做什么，什么时候。
You see, that's just... I have a timetable. I know what I'm cooking, when.

113
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,360
当你有两个高大魁梧的少年时，你就会这样安排自己，
That's the way you organise yourself when you have two strapping teenagers,

114
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,920
这是一份要求高、耗时长的全职工作，
a demanding, time-consuming, full-time job,

115
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,520
还有一个为了酒鬼甩了你的丈夫。
and a husband who dumps you for an alcoholic.

116
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,400
奶奶怎么了?噢,呃…
What's happening with Granny? Oh, er...

117
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,200
她和艾伦没按时出现在吉莉安家，
Her and Alan haven't turned up at Gillian's when they're supposed to,

118
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,640
和…她是,呃……
and...she's, er...

119
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,040
担心他们在哪里。
worried about where they are.

120
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,520
我去换衣服。
I'll get changed.

121
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,640
雨倒
RAIN POURS

122
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,120
马桶冲水
TOILET FLUSHES

123
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,680
那个马桶的冲水很厉害。
Ee, it's got a grand flush, that toilet.

124
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,000
维多利亚时代的人建造得很好，不是吗?
They built things properly, didn't they, the Victorians?

125
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,760
严格来说，这是乔治亚风格的。
Well, strictly speaking, it's Georgian.

126
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,480
1836年，北塔建成
1836, North Tower were completed -

127

在维多利亚登基前一年

128
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:30,120
哦，很好。“房子的主体……”
Oh, very good. "Main body of the house..."

129
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,440
这里，我不知道它有这么古老，可以追溯到1514年!
Here, I didn't know it were this old - dates back to 1514!

130
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,040
哦,漂亮!
Oh, fancy!

131
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,400
是啊，幸好我们没砸窗户。
Yeah, it's a good job we didn't try smashing a window.

132
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:45,800
彩色玻璃是原始的中世纪-它是独一无二的，它是无价的。
Stained glass is original medieval - it's unique, it's priceless.

133
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,840
真见鬼!
Heck!

134
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,120
摇摇欲坠
CREAKING

135
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,720
她在那儿吹。我希望她不会。
There she blows. I wish she wouldn't.

136
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,520
我们陷入困境了，夫人!
We're in t'cludgie, missus!

137
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,560
他们笑了
THEY LAUGH

你好!
Hello!

142

我只是想知道他没事，仅此而已。

你问错人了。
You're asking t'wrong person.

167
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:21,080
除了他和尼尔·克雷斯韦尔的女儿订婚了，
Apart from t'fact that he's engaged to Neil Cresswell's lass,

168
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,880

he's got a mental age of a blancmange. He's retarded.

169
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,680
她找他麻烦可能不是为了他的大脑，对吧?
Well, probably not his brain she's bothering with him for, is it?

170
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,280
我告诉你，她一直都是这么做的。是啊，好吧!
Bloody screw loose, I tell you, she always has had. Yeah, all right!

好吧，我要开车去哈利法克斯。
Right, I'm going to drive over to Halifax.

00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,240
真的吗?
Really?

176
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:47,040
是的。我把时间定在9点吧?
Yeah. Why don't I give it till nine o'clock?

177
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:50,440
是的，我把时间推迟到9点，如果我们还没有听到任何消息，我就……
Yep, I'll give it till nine and if we still haven't heard anything, I'll...

是的，我想可能是。
Yeah, I thought it might be.

我爸爸还没有出现……他本该这么做的时候
Me dad hasn't turned up... when he was supposed to,

185
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:14,760
几个小时前，我想知道拉夫有没有见过他

00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,200
我很抱歉?“打电话的借口。”
I'm sorry? 'Excuses for ringing up.'

189
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,480
她叹了口气，我不是在开玩笑，Robbie。他的心脏有问题。
SHE SIGHS I'm not mucking about, Robbie. He's got his heart problem.

你最后一次通话时他们在哪里?在芬兰的一家咖啡馆里，
Where were they last time you spoke? In a cafe in Elland,

201
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,560
“两点。”从那以后你给他打过电话吗?

不，他们没有。你不必敲门，你知道，你可以直接进来。
No, they haven't. You don't have to knock, you know, you can just come in.

242
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,880

246
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:25,160
什么时候?就在你离开之后。

247
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,560
可能是闪电。
It were probably lightning.

那么，你打算怎么处理……?我将管理。
Well, how are you going to manage...? I'll manage.

是哈利和莫里斯。你爷爷的朋友。
It's Harry and Maurice. Your granddad's buddies.

你觉得有那么严重吗?你认为我应该报警吗?
Do you think it's that serious? Do you think I should report it to the police?

258
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,200
这取决于你。我在征求你的意见。
It's up to you. I'm asking your advice.

259
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:04,720
你想什么时候报告都行。
Well, you can report it any time you like.

你没事吧，亲爱的?

我给傻蛋打了电话，但他也没收到他们的消息。
I rang Silly Bugger but he's not heard owt from 'em either.

Good evening, Gillian. I'm sure there's a perfectly simple explanation.

266
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,280
你希望如此，不是吗?
You'd hope so, wouldn't you?

267
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,840
骑兵的到来。
Cavalry's arrived.

268
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,480
告诉你吧。怎么啦？
Tell you what. What?

00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,680
下雨了。
It's raining.

270
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:38,080
你没事吧，拉夫，小伙子?还不错。
You all right, Raff, lad? Not so bad.

271
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,800
我的上帝!他怎么了?
My God! What's happened to him?

272
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,160
是吗?
Eh?

你没事吧，亲爱的?呃…
You all right, love? Er...

吉莉安，有什么最新消息吗?
So, what's the latest, Gillian?

275
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,200
我跑遍了医院，当然这并不意味着
I've run round the hospitals, but of course that doesn't mean

276
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:54,480
他们并没有在荒野的某个地方离开路边，但是……
they haven't gone off the side of the road somewhere up in t'wilds, but...

277
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,760
不，他们是对的。
Nay, they'll be right.

278
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:59,360
你怎么知道他没带她去什么酒店
How do you know he hasn't taken her to some hotel somewhere

279
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:02,520
为了一个疯狂的夜晚?
for a wild night of nudge-nudge wink-wink?

280
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,160
他满脑子想的都是这个。
It's all he thinks about.

281
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,440
好吗?
Is it 'ell.

282
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,800
我不知道，哈利，我只是……我想他会给我打电话的。
I don't know, that, Harry, I just... I think he'd have rung me.

283
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:12,160
那我们该在什么阶段报警呢?
So, at what stage do we report it to the police?

284
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,760
罗比是……我随时都可以告诉她。
Well, Robbie's... I've told her any time.

285
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,360
考虑到他的…
Given his, er...

00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:19,240
我想11点再做，然后…
I thought I'd leave it while 11, and then...

287
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,600
不。给他们打电话。
Nay. Get 'em rung.

288
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:24,160
我不想…反应过度。
Well, I don't want to...overreact.

289
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:27,960
你不想往最坏的方面想。这就是问题所在。
You don't want to think the worst. That's the thing.

290
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,760
但是…考虑到他……
But...given his...

291
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,080
他们会很感激的，警察，可能还有别的事要做。
They'll be grateful, t'police - probably got bugger all else to do.

292
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:41,240
别那样看着我。我实话实说。
Don't look at me like that. I tell it like it is.

293
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:46,120
我也想，但他偶尔会和你们一起出去吃晚饭
Well, I would, but he has, on occasion, been out supping with you lot all hours

294
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,120
在此之前，便出现了胡言乱语
before now, then turned up talking gibberish

295
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:52,080
裤腿卷起来，外套穿反了。
with his trouser legs rolled up and his coat on inside out.

296
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:56,200
是啊，那太不幸了。
Yes, well, that was...unfortunate.

297
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,280
今天是他的生日!你怎么了?
It were his birthday! What's up with you?

298
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:06,440
错过什么?不，只是该出现的时候没出现。
Missing? No, just not turned up when they were supposed to.

299
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,440
那你觉得他们在哪里?
So, well, where do you think they are?

300
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,360
我不知道!没人知道，那是…
I've got no idea! Nobody does, that's...

301
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,560
对不起，凯特。我只是…
I'm sorry, Kate. I'm just...

302
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,600
伤了?你当然是。没关系。
Wound up? Course you are. That's all right.

303
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,360
我敢肯定她绝对……
I'm sure she's absolutely...

304
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,880
课程。当然可以。
Course. Of course.

305
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:24,200
不过，天黑后她通常不出去，这就是问题所在。
She doesn't go out after dark, as a rule, though, that's the thing.

306
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,960
她的眼睛和以前不一样了，而且……
Her eyes aren't what they were, and...

307
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,800
会有解释的。
There'll be an explanation.

308
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:31,520
听着，有什么我能帮忙的就打电话给我。
Listen, ring me if there's anything I can do.

309
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:34,440
或者你只是想找个人聊聊。
Or if you just want to talk to someone.

310
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,560
你打电话找我干什么?
What were you ringing me for?

311
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,920
哦!
Oh!

312
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:41,160
现在看来不那么重要了。
It doesn't seem so important now.

313
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,360
只是…你说我们应该离开。
Just...you said we should go away.

314
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,680
“这个周末。
'For the weekend.

315
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:50,280
“可能在某个地方一起。
'Together, somewhere, possibly.

316
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:54,040
“我想知道你是不是认真的，如果你是认真的，”
'And I wanted to know if you meant it, and if you did,'

317
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,440
如果我应该修理什么东西
if I should fix something up.

318
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,880
我们能晚点再谈吗?
Can we talk about it later?

319
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,080
是的，当然。
Yeah, of course.

320
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:32,880
嗨。有什么消息吗?我妈妈和罗比在那边跟警察说话。
Hi. Is there any news? Me mum's through there with Robbie talking to a uniform.

321
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:35,520
你是西莉亚的女儿吗?
Are you Celia's lass?

322
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,560
是的,那是……
Yes, that's...

323
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,680
哈利华莱士。
Harry Wallace.

324
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,040
我是莫里斯·普莱斯。
This is Maurice Price.

325
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,800
他们是我爷爷的朋友。啊。
They're me granddad's pals. Ah.

326
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:45,800
希望你妈妈没有把他引入歧途。是…?
I hope your mother's not been leading him astray. Been...?

327
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,520
闭嘴。拉斯很担心。
Shut up. Lass is worried.

328
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,440
她知道我在开玩笑。
She knows I'm joking.

329
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:54,440
我知道你是个医生!
I understand you're a doctor!

330
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,400
我…是的。
I'm... Yeah.

331
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,440
她是吗?
Is she?

332
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,120
你能看看我的脚吗?
Will you look at my foot?

333
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:02,760
把你的脚拿开。我血液循环不好。
Put your foot away. I've got poor circulation.

334
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:05,080
我不是医生
I'm not a medical doctor.

335
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,440
然后呢?化学。
What then, then? Chemistry.

336
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,600
化学，他们能做到吗?
Chemistry, can they do that?

337
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,480
忽略他。
Ignore him.

338
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,640
他的农村。
He's rural.

339
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:16,400
我也有疝气。我想是疝气。你想看一看吗?
I've a hernia as well. I think it's a hernia. Do you want to have a look?

340
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,080
这不是我的…
It's not really my...

341
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:22,640
我们知道发生了什么吗?没有任何进展。
Do we know what's happening? There's been no developments.

342
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:26,200
你为什么不坐下呢，亲爱的?
Why don't you sit down, love?

343
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,960
化学。
Chemistry.

344
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,920
玛格丽特·撒切尔在牛津大学读化学。
Margaret Thatcher read chemistry at Oxford.

345
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,960
是的，我在另一所大学。
Yes, well, I was in a different college.

346
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,960
是啊，我会道歉的。
Yeah, and I'd be apologising an' all.

347
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,680
发生了什么事?什么都没有。什么都没有。
What's happened? Nothing. Nothing.

348
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:49,200
就像我在电话里说的，我们觉得没什么好损失的，
It were just, like I said on t'phone, we decided there was nothing to lose,

349
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:53,600
尽快报告他们失踪，所以....
reporting 'em missing sooner rather than later, so....

350
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,800
你还好吗?是的。是的。是吗?
Are you all right? Yeah. Yeah. Are you?

351
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,640
是的。
Yeah.

352
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:04,040
他们已经做了描述，他们可以…
They've taken a description, and they can...

353
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:07,320
他们要做什么，Robbie?检查银行卡最后一次使用的时间，
What are they going to do, Robbie? Check when the bank cards were last used,

354
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:10,040
他们最后一次使用手机的时间。然后我们就跑
when their mobiles were last used. And then we'll run

355
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,480
对他们的车辆进行ANPR检查那是什么?
an ANPR check on their vehicle. What's that?

356
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:15,480
荷兰的两倍。这就像车牌识别。
Double Dutch. It's like vehicle plate recognition.

357
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:19,120
我们可以看到他们最后被摄像头拍到的地方。看看他们要去哪里。
We can see where they were last picked up on cameras. See where they were heading.

358
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:23,440
那我们什么时候能知道呢?只要我们得到楼上的授权去追查。
So when will we know anything? As soon as we get authority from upstairs to pursue it.

359
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:27,560
跟我们谈话的那个小伙子要直接去见警长，所以…
The lad that we spoke to is going straight up to see t'Super, so...

360
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,760
最好的办法是……
Best thing we can...

361
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,760
他们说我们最好还是回家。
They said best thing we can do is go home.

362
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,640
他们知道了会给我们打电话的。
They'll ring us when they know owt.

363
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,880
你们为什么不回家呢，伙计们?
Why don't you go home, lads?

364
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:38,520
如果我需要你，我会给你打电话。如果有什么消息。
I'll ring you if I need you. If there's any news.

365
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:53,200
“你好，我是西莉亚·道森。请留下……”
'Hello, this is Celia Dawson. Please leave...'

366
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,160
你是谁?
Who IS that?

367
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,760
保罗……Jatri。
Paul...Jatri.

368
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:05,000
他是个白痴。
He's an idiot.

369
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,600
保罗Jat……?那就是你…?
Paul Jat...? Is that the bloke you...?

370
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:10,240
是的。但我没有那样对他。
Yeah. But I didn't do that to him.

371
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,400
我只是碰伤了他。
I just bruised him.

372
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,200
那是另一个人。
That was somebody else.

373
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,760
正确的。
Right.

374
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,000
他不受欢迎。
He's not popular.

375
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,120
是什么……他在这里做什么?
So what's... What's he doing here?

376
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,560
这是个好问题。
That's a good question.

377
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,400
不要问。
Don't ask.

378
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,480
(你拿着那个量尺干什么?)
(What were you doing with that dipstick?)

379
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,160
别责怪我，我已经受够了。
Don't start on me, I've enough on.

380
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,520
我只是…
I just...

381
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,840
我所做的是……
What I do is...

382
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,320
你以为我会成为修女吗?
You think I'm going to be a nun?

383
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:47,000
不!不。艾迪已经死了十年了。
No! No. Eddie's been dead for ten years.

384
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:50,360
你真以为从那以后我就没跟别人睡过吗?
D'you seriously think I haven't slept with other people since then?

385
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,240
我只是…这关你什么事?
I just... What's it to you?

386
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,080
我很抱歉。
I'm sorry.

387
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:59,200
关于我们之间的不愉快。
About all the unpleasantness there's been between us.

388
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,360
不愉快?
Unpleasantness?

389
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,960
想让别人相信我有问题吗?
Trying to convince people that I've got a screw loose?

390
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,880
我谋杀了自己的丈夫?想让拉菲相信吗?我在发泄。
That I murdered my own husband? Trying to make Raffy believe that? I was lashing out.

391
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,800
十年?我很抱歉。
For ten years? I'm sorry.

392
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,280
我只是觉得……
I just think...

393
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,760
…你让自己失望了。
...you let yourself down.

394
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:18,680
为一连串的…随便吧，像他一样。
Bothering with a streak of...whatever, like him.

395
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,360
你应该做得更好。
You're better than that.

396
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,440
我以为……
I thought...

397
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:30,600
…在艾迪死后，你是最重要的
...after Eddie died, you of all people

398
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,080
会帮助我，支持我。
would help me, support me.

399
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,360
妈的，我错了，对吧?
Shit, I was wrong, wasn't it?

400
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,240
你以为我会忘记你对我做的事吗?
D'you think I'm going to forget what you tried to do to me?

401
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:42,200
你让我经历了什么?
What you put me through?

402
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,480
我们可以组成一个完美的团队。
We could make an all-right team.

403
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:48,960
你，我，还有拉夫，不是吗?
You, me, an' Raff, couldn't we?

404
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,880
你烧了我的路虎吗?
Did you torch my Land Rover?

405
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,400
不!
No!

406
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,360
如果克雷斯韦尔家族这么做了，我会……
If the Cresswells did, I will...

407
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,600
我会抓住他们的。
I'll get 'em.

408
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,040
这是……
That's...

409
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,920
嗯…
Um...

410
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:12,440
我很感激你的道歉，Robbie。
I'm appreciating the apology, Robbie.

411
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,800
它很好。
It's fine.

412
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,440
上床睡觉。
Go to bed.

413
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:30,320
一有消息我就通知你。
I'll let you know the second we hear owt.

414
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,080
我们都无能为力。
There's nowt any of us can do.

415
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,800
至少闭上眼睛吧，你明天还要上学。
Go shut your eyes at least, you've got school tomorrow.

416
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,320
电话响了
PHONE RINGS

417
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,680
喂?
Hello?

418
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:42,840

哦,是的。
Oh, yeah.

4.32,对吧。
4.32, right.

421
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,280
对布拉德福德? !
Towards Bradford?!

422
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,440
无道?
Godley Lane?

423
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,720
他不认识那边的人。
He doesn't know anybody over that way.

424
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:56,960
等一下。
Hang on a minute.

425
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,520
他们被摄像头拍到，或者他们的注册号是。
They were caught on camera, or their registration number was.

426
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:05,240
沿着哈利法克斯另一边的戈德利巷，驶向布拉德福德。
Driving up Godley Lane, the other side of Halifax, towards Bradford.

427
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:08,360
没有进一步的目击。正确的。所以你……?
No further sightings. Right. So you're...?

428
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:13,960
他们最初集中在那片区域。
They're concentrating on that area round there initially.

429
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,360
那附近有什么?
What is there around there?

430
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:18,280
什么都没有，只有南屋厅，仅此而已。
There's nothing, there's Southowram Hall, that's about it.

431
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:21,080
喃喃自语:你可以在southwram大厅结婚。他说了什么?
MUMBLING: You can get married at Southowram Hall. What's he said?

432
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,600
他说你可以在索瑟伦庄园结婚。
He said you can get married at Southowram Hall.

433
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,600
他们在找婚礼场地。
They were looking for a wedding venue.

434
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,360
电视剧
TV PLAYS

435
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:12,480
你和妈妈现在还在离婚吗?
Are you and Mum still getting divorced then now, or what?

436
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:14,040
哦,好吧…
Oh, well...

437
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,320
恐怕我不知道。
I'm afraid I don't know.

438
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,600
你不能说服她吗?
Can't you win her round?

439
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:20,880
你不能…给她买些花什么的?
Can't you...buy her some flowers or something?

440
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:23,120
嗯，我有。几乎。
Well, I had. Almost.

441
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,320
赢得了她的支持。我认为。然后……
Won her round. I think. And then...

442
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:28,160
别怪我。我不是!
Don't you blame me. I wasn't!

443
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,520
我不是。
I wasn't.

444
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,520
不过你确实误会了。
Although you did get the wrong end of the stick.

445
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:35,120
是啊，如果你还没发现…一开始就是个贱人
Yeah, well, if you hadn't started seeing that...bitch in the first place,

446
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:38,880
不会有任何错误的一端给任何人抓住，不是吗?
there wouldn't be any wrong end of any sticks for anybody to get hold of, would there?

447
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:43,360
是的,很好。我们现在真的要争论这个吗?重点是，你再也见不到朱蒂丝了，
Yeah, fine. Are we really going to argue about this now? The point is, you're not seeing Judith any more,

448
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,280
所以你不需要再离婚了。
so you don't need to get divorced any more.

449
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:49,200
不，重点是，她不能再信任他了，不能再信任他了。
No, the point is, she can't trust him any more, any further than she can throw him.

450
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:53,240
所以这并不像说“你不能给她买些花吗?”那么天真和愚蠢。
So it's not just as naive and dumb as saying, "Can't you buy her some flowers?!"

451
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,600
尿了!是啊，成熟点吧!
Piss off! Yeah, well, grow up!

452
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,160
你成熟点吧!冷静点。停止它!阻止它。
You grow up! Just calm down. Stop it! Stop it.

453
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:02,120
我们都很担心奶奶，这不是一个好办法…
We're all worried about Gran, and this isn't a good way to...

454
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:04,200
他嗤之以鼻
HE SNIFFS

455
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,080
我相信我和妈妈能解决问题。
I'm sure me and Mum can sort things out.

456
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:11,680
这些事有时需要时间，仅此而已。
These things take time, sometimes, that's all.

457
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,720
还有一点善意。
And a bit of goodwill.

458
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:23,040
我很抱歉那天把我丈夫强加给你。
I'm sorry I inflicted my husband on you the other day.

459
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:27,680
哦，好吧，不用道歉。
Oh, well, don't apologise.

460
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:30,640
我很抱歉我儿子在你们面前被捕了…
I'm sorry my son got arrested in front of you all...

461
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:33,360
由他自己…
by his own...

462
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,640
叔叔。
uncle.

463
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:39,160
所以他……拉夫揍了躺在你沙发上的那个家伙。
So he... Raff beat up the bloke that's lying on your couch.

464
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,680
是的。是的,他……
Yeah. Yeah, he...

465
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,600
他是保罗。他的……
He's Paul. He's...

466
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,400
我和保罗是朋友
We're friends, me and Paul,

467
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:49,240
拉夫觉得我们不仅仅是朋友
and Raff got it into his head that we were more than friends

468
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:51,520
他不喜欢这样。所以他……
and he didn't like that. So he...

469
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:55,840
然后又有人把他打得更狠?是的。
Then someone else beat him up even more? Yeah.

470
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:00,360
他女朋友的兄弟们听到了风声，
His girlfriend's brothers got wind of what'd been said,

471
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,560
而且，他们是一群令人讨厌的人。
and, well, they're a pretty unpleasant lot.

472
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:09,520
哦……他断腿是因为什么误会吗?
Oh... He's got broken limbs because of some misunderstanding?

473
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:17,240
那么，一切都解决了吗?
So, has everything settled down?

474
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:20,960
然后呢?现在?呃，在你那边?
Then? Now? Er, at your end?

475
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,360
或者…?
Or...?

476
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,040
哦!呃…
Oh! Er...

477
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,120
我和约翰。
Me and John.

478
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,160
是的。
Yeah.

479
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,720
远不止于此。
It's beyond that.

480
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,240
他跟你说了什么?
What did he tell you?

481
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,360
哦，那个，呃……
Oh, that, er...

482
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,960
她清喉咙
SHE CLEARS THROAT

483
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,680
…他有过一段风流韵事
...he'd had a fling,

484
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,720
和…
and...

485
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:47,040
是啊，他希望自己没这么做。
Yeah, that he wished he hadn't.

486
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:50,040
真的吗?嗯。他只是想…
Really? Mmm. And that he wanted just to...

487
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,560
…回去吧。
...get back with you.

488
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:57,800
如果他明天遇到想和他一起做的人他还会再做的。
Well, he'd do it again tomorrow if he met someone else he wanted to do it with.

489
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,920
他就是这么抱歉。
That's how sorry he is.

490
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,960
你还好吗?
Are you all right?

491
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,360
累了。
Tired.

492
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,720
他们到底在哪?!
Where the hell are they?!

493
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,080
对不起。
Sorry.

494
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,400
我很抱歉。这对谁都没有帮助。
I'm sorry. That helps no-one.

495
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:18,200
不，你没事的。你担心。喝点白兰地。是的,真的。
No, you're all right. You're worried. Have a drop of brandy. Yes, actually.

496
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:43,640
这不是，呃，误会。
It wasn't, er, a misunderstanding.

497
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,200
我…
I...

498
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:52,480
我不知道。我都不知道我为什么要告诉你。
I don't know. I don't even know why I'm telling you.

499
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,880
不过拉夫一般不会这么做。
Except that Raff doesn't generally behave like that.

500
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:04,360
他的……他不是暴徒。他是个好孩子。
He's... He's not a thug. He's a grand lad.

501
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,200
比我应得的好。
Better than I deserve.

502
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,320
他就像我爸爸。
He's like my dad.

503
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:11,720
他有一个伟大的连胜纪录
He's got a big streak

504
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,640
他身上刻下了一些体面的印记。
of something very decent etched right through him.

505
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,080
我没有。
And I haven't.

506
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:20,720
我一团糟。
I'm a mess.

507
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,600
你知道的。
Well, you know that.

508
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:26,360
你第一次见到我的时候就明白了。
Put your finger on it the first time you met me.

509
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:31,040
我不该那么说的。这很愚蠢。我不是故意的，我是…
I shouldn't have said that. It was stupid. I didn't mean it, it was...

510
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,080
我一直在…
I've been...

511
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,880
我一直很沮丧。
I've been depressed.

512
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,880
好几个月了。
For months.

513
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,600
把东西装瓶，然后……
Bottling things up and then...

514
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:49,640
它出来了，你说了些愚蠢、下流、愚蠢的话，
it comes out, and you say things - silly, nasty, stupid things,

515
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:52,120
你根本不是那个意思，而且自从…
things you don't even mean, and it's since...

516
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,720
这是自…
It's since...

517
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,880
大多数时候，我觉得我只是在压抑自己的工作，
I feel like I'm only just holding my job down, most days,

518
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,440
这就是……
and that's...

519
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,360
这是可怕的。
It's terrifying.

520
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:12,400
抱歉，你也不需要知道这个。
Sorry, you don't need to know that, either.

521
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,640
电话响了
PHONE RINGS

522
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,680
喂?
Hello?

523
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,200
他们找到车了。
They've found the car.

524
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:30,720
在康布里伍德南瑟伦大厅楼上的停车场里。
In the car park above Southowram Hall in Cumbry Wood.

525
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:32,640
但不是他们?
But not them?

526
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:33,720
喂?
Hello?

527
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:36,600
我们现在解雇了很多警官。
We're turning a good number of officers out now.

528
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,920
这附近有什么地方吗
Is there anywhere at all in the vicinity

529
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,720
你觉得他们最有可能去哪了?
where you think they're most likely to have gone?

530
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:45,560
我能帮你吗?我是馆长。你的中士打电话给我。
Can I help you? I'm the curator. Your sergeant rang me.

531
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,240
我尽快赶过来了。两个退休?
I got here as soon as I could. Two pensioners?

532
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:50,640
您是钥匙持有者吗，先生?其中一个。
Are you the key holder, sir? One of them.

533
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:54,080
我可以为你开门，非常欢迎，但我们昨天没开门。
I can open up for you, you're more than welcome, but we weren't open yesterday.

534
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:57,040
我们星期一不营业。从星期天起我们就没有客人了。
We don't open on a Monday. We've had no visitors since Sunday.

535
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:01,200
我能问一下，他们俩最近有抑郁吗?
Can I ask, has either of them been depressed at all lately?

536
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:03,360
不!一点也不!
No! Not at all!

537
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:06,400
完全相反!他们彼此相爱。
Completely the opposite! They're in love with each other.

538
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:07,960
他们从来没有这么快乐过!
They've never been happier!

539
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:25,680
对，就是这样。奇怪的事情发生了。
Right, that's it. Summat weird's happening.

540
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:28,360
为什么车在那里，他们不在里面?
Why's the car there and them not in it?

541
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:31,560
然后问我他们最近有没有抑郁过?
And asking me if either of them has been depressed lately?

542
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:35,520
他们只是想排除一切可能，吉莉安。这是例行公事。
They're just trying to rule things out, Gillian. It's routine.

543
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:38,120
他们只是在想最好的办法。
They're just trying to think of the best way forward.

544
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:41,480
这没有什么邪恶的。他不像你那么了解他们。
There's nothing sinister about it. He doesn't know 'em like you do.

545
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:45,040
他只是想建立一幅画面。他只是在做他的工作。
He's just trying to build up a picture. He's just doing his job.

546
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:47,480
你想开车过去吗?我不会。
Do you want to drive over there? I wouldn't.

547
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,960
说实话，你最好待在这里，暖和点。
Honestly, you're best off here, in t'warm.

548
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,120
如果你们去那里，只会更加紧张。
You're only going to wind yourselves up even more if you go over there.

549
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:55,760
让他们继续吧。他们知道自己在做什么。
Let them get on with it. They know what they're doing.

550
00:30:56,800 --> 00:31:00,920
听着，这种事时有发生……每一个星期。
Look, stuff like this happens... every week.

551
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,920
这并不罕见。
It's not unusual.

552
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,520
十有八九，会有完美的…
Nine times out of ten, there's a perfectly...

553
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:10,640
不一定是一个合理的解释，但总有一个解释。
Well, not necessarily a rational explanation, but there's an explanation.

554
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:15,160
人们马上就来了。他们经常因为这样的小题大做而感到尴尬!
People turn up right as rain. They're often embarrassed there's been such a fuss!

555
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,720
我只希望他在某个温暖的地方。
I just hope he's warm somewhere.

556
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:22,080
别在这外面。我为什么不过去呢?
Not out in this. Why don't I go over there?

557
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:26,360
我可能会发现一些问题。而且我能更好地让你了解最新情况。
I might find summat out. And I can keep you up to date better.

558
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,880
你想去吗?
Do you want to?

559
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,200
是的。
Yeah.

560
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:31,640
每天早上醒来都能看到这个感觉真好。
It's very nice, waking up to this every morning.

561
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,760
嗯,是的。
Well, yeah.

562
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,360
在夏天。
In summer.

563
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:38,960
我爸爸…
Me dad...

564
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:45,480
…我在说，如果西莉亚来和我们一起住，你会怎么想?
...was saying, how would you feel if Celia came to live with us here?

565
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:49,480
他只是在猜测。我觉得他们还没做决定。
He was just speculating. I don't think they've made a decision.

566
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:54,160
我说我很乐意，但我不知道她冬天会怎么过。
And I said I'd be delighted, but I don't know how she'd go on in winter.

567
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,880
风会把你吹倒。
Wind can knock you over.

568
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:59,560
去年我们有八英尺高的积雪。
We had eight-foot snowdrifts last year.

569
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:04,640
不，我想象不出她挤牛奶的样子。
No, I can't quite picture her milking cows.

570
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,760
我没有奶牛。
I don't have any cows.

571
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,000
只羊。
Just sheep.

572
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:15,560
我一直想要一个农场。
I always wanted a farm.

573
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:18,360
我不知道为什么。我不是天生的。
I don't know why. I wasn't born into it.

574
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:23,080
是你丈夫吗?上帝,不!
Was your husband? God, no!

575
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:28,560
骑自行车和喝酒是他的两大职业选择。
Biking and boozing were his two big career choices.

576
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:32,120
是我做了所有的讨价还价和调查。
It was me that did all the wheeling and dealing and finding out.

577
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:36,800
他很喜欢。嗯，他很喜欢。但是…
He liked it. Well, he loved it. But...

578
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:39,640
他在哪里?
Where is he?

579
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,520
死了。
Dead.

580
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:43,560
十年，下次再来。
Ten years, this next time.

581
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,320
发生了什么事?
What happened?

582
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,720
用劈柴机打碎了他的头骨。
Smashed his skull with a log splitter.

583
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,720
哦!在t 'barn。
Oh! In t'barn.

584
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,080
耶稣。
Jesus.

585
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,240
失血过多而死。
Bled to death.

586
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:58,960
这样也好。
Which was just as well.

587
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,560
如果他能活下来，他的大脑也会受损。
He'd have had brain damage if he'd survived.

588
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:06,480
我找到他了。那是愉快的!
I found him. That was pleasant!

589
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,160
是意外吗?
Was it an accident?

590
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:11,840
不。
No.

591
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,760
哦,嗯。
Oh, eh.

592
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,600
对不起。
Sorry.

593
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:22,240
你觉得他们死了吗?不。
Do you think they're dead? No.

594
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:27,360
不，我觉得我们不该这么想。
No, I don't think we should assume that.

595
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:32,040
他爱她，你知道的。这么多。
He loves her, you know. So much.

596
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:34,560
他的……它是美丽的。
He's... It's beautiful.

597
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:38,080
这是非凡的。
It's extraordinary.

598
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:47,640
不管发生了什么，他都会照顾她的。
Whatever has happened, he'll be looking after her.

599
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,040
我知道。
I know that.

600
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,880
我知道。
I know.

601
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,720
但这让我很困扰。
It's bothered me, though.

602
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:01,440
关于我母亲的事…
That thing about me mother...

603
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:03,800
没有把这个信息传递给他。
not passing on that message to him.

604
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,400
你妈妈的。
From your mum.

605
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,560
因为，你知道，我想……
Because, you know, I suppose...

606
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:15,960
．.你想要能够想象她会为他感到高兴。
..you want to be able to think that she'd have been happy for him.

607
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,640
过了这么久才见到西莉亚。
Meeting up with Celia after all this time.

608
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:22,880
他一直很……
He's been so...

609
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:26,920
. .快乐。
..happy.

610
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:33,040
但也许她不会。
But maybe she wouldn't have been.

611
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:38,240
她嫉妒到一开始就阻止他们在一起。
She were jealous enough to stop 'em getting together in t'first place.

612
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,520
也许她真的…!
Maybe she'd have been really...!

613
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:43,360
她这么做的时候还是个青少年。
She was a teenager when she did that.

614
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:48,480
她当时和拉夫现在一样大——没有人会因此而责怪她。
She was the same age Raff is now - nobody can hold that against her.

615
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:49,760
但是她欺骗了他……
But she deceived him...

616
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,560
…他们的一生。
...all their lives.

617
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,680
而他只是刚刚发现。
And he's only just found out.

618
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,520
我想这让他很难过。
And I think it's upset him.

619
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:03,200
他什么也没说。不。
He hasn't said owt. No.

620
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:09,000
如果你爸爸没有娶你妈妈，我妈妈没有嫁给我爸爸，
If your dad hadn't married your mum, and my mum hadn't married my dad,

621
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:12,200
我们俩都不会在这里，所以…或者我们可以成为姐妹。
neither of us would be here, so... Or we could've been sisters.

622
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:15,280
是啊，那就…灾难。
Yeah, well that would have been a... Disaster.

623
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,840
他们笑了
THEY LAUGH

624
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:20,880
我想我们应该感谢你妈妈默默为她所做的一切。
I think we should be very grateful to your mum on the quiet for doing what she did.

625
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,400
是的。
Yeah.

626
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,880
你的父母很高兴，是吗?是的,是的!
Your parents were happy, weren't they? Yeah, yeah!

627
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,200
那好吧!
Well, then!

628
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:29,200
他们似乎一直都是。
They always seemed to be.

629
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,320
不是你的吗?
Weren't yours?

630
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,200
嗯…
Well...

631
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,520
这就是奇怪的地方。
that's what's so odd.

632
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:40,800
她突然和我过去45年认识的那个人完全不一样了。
She's suddenly such a different person to the one I've known for the last 45 years.

633
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:46,840
我突然觉得她好像还活着，好像我从没见过她。
It's suddenly like she's alive, like I've never seen her before.

634
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:53,760
锁和门咔哒响
LOCKS AND DOORS CLICK

635
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:01,120
遥远的声音
DISTANT VOICES

636
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:05,480
西莉亚?西莉亚!
Celia? Celia!

637
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,120
哦，我一直在睡觉。
Oh, I've been asleep.

638
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:10,160
Ssh !Ssh !
Ssh! Ssh!

639
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:14,640
现在几点了?
What time is it?

640
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,840
噢，差二十分八点了!
Oh, it's twenty to eight!

641
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,880
哦，永远不会!
Oh, it's never!

642
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,760
它是!
It is!

643
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,600
哦!哦，我僵了!
Oh! Ooh, I'm stiff!

644
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:24,920
是的。
Yeah.

645
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,720
来吧。
Come on.

646
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:29,480
你还好吗?是的。
Are you all right? Yeah.

647
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,320
我想是的。
I think so.

648
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,840
是吗?
Are you?

649
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,600
哦，我不知道!
Oh, I've no idea!

650
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:45,600
我肯定在我们回到床上之前就把门关上了。
I'm sure I shut that door before we got back into bed.

651
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,720
哦，我们走吧。
Oh, let's get out of here.

652
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:57,800
我并不乐观。他们都70多岁了，
I'm not optimistic. Both in their 70s,

653
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,400
整晚都在外面。你好!
out all night. Hello!

654
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,680
我们被关在里面了!你负责吗?
We've been shut in! Are you in charge?

655
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:06,200
我,呃……我们带了些巧克力，我们必须带。
I, er... We took some chocolate, we had to.

656
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,480
我在收银台留下了一张5英镑的钞票。
I've left a £5 note by the till.

657
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:10,760
你还好吗?我整理了床铺。
Are you all right? And I made the bed.

658
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,200
你应该打电话求救的。我们做不到!
You should have rung for help. We couldn't make it work!

659
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:16,360
而且你的手机也收不到信号!你必须按9号铃打外线。
And you can't get a signal on t'mobile! You've to ring 9 for an outside line.

660
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,640
你应该把它写在手机旁边的小卡片上，
Well, you should have it written by the phone on a bit of card,

661
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,840
这样人们就会知道了。我们昨天不营业。
then folk would know. We weren't open yesterday.

662
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:24,800
那扇门。我们有个送货…
That door was. We had a delivery...

663
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:27,920
大约四点半?我的天啊!
About half past fourish? Oh, my God!

664
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,920
我们等着买票。
We waited to buy tickets.

665
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:33,200
但是没有人来，所以我们在那里闲逛，寻找一个人。
Only nobody came, so we wandered through there, looking for somebody.

666
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:35,880
是啊，然后我们听到关门的声音。就是这样。
Yeah, and then we heard the door slam. And that was that.

667
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:38,680
我很惊讶我们没有启动警报。
I'm amazed we didn't set t'alarm off.

668
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
哦，该死的。
Oh, bloody hell.

669
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:45,840
你现在没法给我们接通外线，对吧?
You couldn't get us an outside line right now, could you?

670
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:48,720
只会有人想知道我们到底在哪里!
Only there'll be people wondering where the heck we are!

671
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:50,000
是的。有。
Yeah. There are.

672
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:52,600
西约克郡一半的警察都在找你!
Half of West Yorkshire Police are out looking for you!

673
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:59,080
约翰:“你打算怎么处理工作?”
JOHN: 'What are you going to do about work?'

674
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:03,960
我已经和副局长谈过了。他们可以在没有我的情况下维持下去，只要…
I've spoken to the deputy heads. They can keep things afloat without me for as long as, um...

675
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,040
我以为我们现在已经有所了解了。
I thought we'd know something by now.

676
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:08,800
孩子们怎么样了?我不会送劳伦斯去上学的。
How are the boys? I'm not sending Lawrence to school.

677
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:12,400
反正威廉今天也没有考试，但他们俩都没合眼。
William's not got any exams today anyway, but neither of them slept a wink.

678
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:14,600
“嗯，我们谁也没见过。”它很好。
'Well, none of us have.' It's fine.

679
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:17,040
电话响得很好。
PHONE RINGS Fine.

680
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:19,200
你好!爷爷!
Hello! Granddad!

681
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:20,400
我的天啊!
Oh, my God!

682
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:21,640
你们俩都没事吧?
Are you both all right?

683
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:25,800
夫人……博士吗?卡洛琳在这里。她整晚都在这里…
Mrs... Dr? Caroline's here. She's been here all night with...

684
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:28,480
我能跟她谈谈吗?她想和西莉亚谈谈。
Can I talk to her? She wants to talk to Celia.

685
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:30,880
妈妈?
Mum?

686
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:33,440
吉莉安!妈妈!
Gillian! Mum!

687
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:36,280
吉莉安!吉莉安!
Gillian! Gillian!

688
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:39,680
他们很好。他们很好!他们绝对没问题。
They're fine. They're fine! They're absolutely fine.

689
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:41,520
他们被关在南大厅里了。
They got shut inside Southowram Hall.

690
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:44,040
他们一直在打牌和吃巧克力!
They've been playing cards and eating chocolate!

691
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,200
关在? !是啊!
Shut in?! Yeah!

692
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:47,480
警察没想过要先进去看看吗?!
Didn't t'police think to look in there first?!

693
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:51,840
他们笑了
THEY LAUGH

694
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:54,320
哦，我要杀了他!
Oh, I'll kill him!

695
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,880
慵懒的…!
Dozy...!

696
00:39:55,920 --> 00:40:01,400
只有他能自己去……!
Only he could go getting himself in a...!

697
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,600
吉莉安笑
GILLIAN LAUGHS

698
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:05,560
哦!
Oh!

699
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:25,000
好了，学校。
OK, so, school.

700
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:28,600
妈妈说你不必去，所以我建议你卧床休息，可能的话，玩Xbox。
Mum says you don't have to go, so I suggest bed, day off, Xbox, possibly.

701
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:31,080
是的!大胆去做吧。显然不是你。
Yes! Go for it. Not you, obviously.

702
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:32,760
你必须复习。
You have to revise.

703
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,760
很遗憾，我得去超市。
I, sadly, have to go to the supermarket.

704
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:49,360
他呻吟道:“你最好还是上楼，别挡道。”
HE GROANS You'll be better off upstairs, out of t'way.

705
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:51,560
你要睡在哪里?在t 'settee。
Where will you sleep? On t'settee.

706

我会把你的车藏在谷仓里，如果有人来找你…
I'll hide your car in t'barn, then if anybody comes looking for you...

707
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,720
不，不，不。
No, no, no.

708
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,200
他们唉声叹气
THEY GROAN AND GASP

709
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:01,040
．.我会告诉他们你不在这里。
..I'll tell 'em you're not here.

710
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:03,400
她呼气了，好吗?
SHE EXHALES OK?

711
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:07,960
他们喘着气呻吟着
THEY GASP AND GROAN

712
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:12,080
好的。
OK.

713

对吧……
Right...

你……在我有机会向我爸爸解释之前不要声张
you...keep it quiet till I've had a chance to explain to me dad

715
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:22,000
你他妈在这儿干什么。
what the bloody hell you're doing here.

716
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:23,880

..when I have, I don't want any vulgar comments

718

出现在西莉亚面前!
of any description in front of Celia!

719
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:32,680
完全理解了吗?
Is that absolutely understood?

720
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:36,600
因为如果你这么做，你就得滚蛋了，比你说"复合骨折"还快。
Cos you'll be out on your arse if you do, faster than you can say "compound fracture".

721
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:39,720
我说过你有什么问题吗?
Now, is there anything I've said you're having trouble with?

722
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:43,320
他呻吟着说:你给我止痛药了吗?
HE GROANS Have you got me painkillers?

723
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:47,000
我去给你倒点水。
I'll get you some water.

724
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:50,360
真希望我能早点把他关进来。
I wish I'd have thought to stick him in here sooner.

725
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,760
拉夫:妈妈，他们来了!比;
RAFF: Mum, they're here! &gt;

726
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:02,720
发生了什么事? !哦!
What happened?! Oh!

727
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:05,400
你不是应该在工作吗?是的。
Shouldn't you be at work? Yes.

728
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:10,920
嘿，那是谁的车?昨晚一屋子人都坐满了想知道你到底去哪了。
Hey, whose car is that? We had a full house last night trying to work out where the hell you were.

729
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,880
嘿!那是我们的路虎吗?
Hey! Is that our Land Rover?!

730
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:14,160
它被闪电击中了。
It was hit by lightning.

731
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:17,720
你还好吗?僵硬、冰冷、头脑迟钝。
Are you all right? Stiff, cold and muzzy-headed.

732
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:20,720
我希望警察给那个把你锁在里面的人一枚火箭
I hope the police gave whoever locked you in a rocket up their...

733
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:22,480
哦，那是肯定的。
ROBBIE: Oh, that's guaranteed.

734
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:25,200
我们以为你私奔了!嗯，好主意。
We thought you'd eloped! Eh, that's a good idea.

735
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:27,400
你饿了吗?
Are you hungry?

736
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:30,280
哦，一杯加糖的好茶，我想。
Oh, a nice cup of tea with a bit of sugar, I think.

737
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:33,120
哦，我们可以喝茶!他需要他的药!
Oh, we can do tea! And he needs his pills!

738
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:34,960
你说那是谁的车?
Hey, whose car did you say that were?

739
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,120
哦，是…是保罗·贾特里的。
Oh, it's, um... It's Paul Jatri's.

740
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:40,160
保罗Jatri ?是啊!
Paul Jatri? Yeah!

741
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:43,200
是的,他是……我去烧壶水。
Yeah, he's... I'll get t'kettle on.

742
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:44,480
你感觉怎么样?
How do you feel?

743
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:47,560
用劳伦斯的话来说，就像呕吐热身一样。
Oh, like puke warmed up, to quote our Lawrence.

744
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:56,080
嗨。啊。
Hi. Ah.

745
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:57,920
很抱歉。
Sorry about this.

746
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:03,640
两个月的房租。
Two months' rent.

747
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:06,840
你真是太好了。
You really are very kind.

748
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:10,880
约翰?你还好吗?
John? Are you all right?

749
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:13,800
我昨晚没怎么睡。
Oh, didn't get much sleep last night.

750
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:17,680
天啊，我不是故意让你惊慌的!我没有勒索你!
God, I didn't mean for you to get panicky! I'm not blackmailing you!

751
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:20,400
我岳母失踪了。哦。
My mother-in-law went missing. Oh.

752
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:22,000
她是……?很好。她很好。
Is she...? Fine. She's fine.

753
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:23,480
她绝对没事。
She's absolutely fine.

754
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:26,800
哦，那太好了。
Oh, well, that's...good.

755
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:31,880
我想问问蒂姆·霍斯金斯能不能让我回去工作
I was thinking of asking Tim Hoskins if I could have my old job back

756
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:33,320
在大学图书馆。
at the university library.

757
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:35,880
朱蒂丝，是蒂姆·霍斯金斯让你离开的。
Judith, it was Tim Hoskins who asked you to leave.

758
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:41,600
我知道，但我想，如果你能帮我说句话，
Yes, I know, but I thought, if you could put a word in for me,

759
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:43,760
如果你告诉他我在好转
if you told him that I'm getting better

760
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:45,520
我正在处理这件事
and I'm dealing with it and...

761
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:47,200
我想他现在已经取代你了。
I imagine he's replaced you by now.

762
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:49,440
是的，但下次有空缺的时候。
Yes, but next time there's a vacancy.

763
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:51,200
朱迪思,不!
Judith, no!

764
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:54,600
我去告诉卡洛琳我给了你那笔钱，好吗?
I'm going to tell Caroline I've given you that money, all right?

765
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:58,360
求你了，别再向我要了。我认为在就业方面，
And please, don't ask me for any more. I think as regards employment,

766
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:03,000
你得把眼光放在更现实的事情上。说“现实”，就说“卑微”?
you're going to have to set your sights on something more realistic. For "realistic", read "menial"?!

767
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:09,160
你要把我介绍给你的出版商!你有什么成品要给他看吗?
You WERE going to introduce me to your publisher! Have you got anything finished to show him?

768
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:11,280
我又写了一章，那是第四章!
I've written another chapter, that's four!

769
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:15,760
朱蒂丝，我已经解释过了。没人会出版几章。我知道!
Judith, I've explained this. No-one's going to publish a few chapters. I know that!

770
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:20,440
没有人会因为他们的力量给你预支钱。
And no-one's going to advance you some money on the strength of them.

771
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:22,480
我们又回到了现实世界!
Again, we come back to living in the real world!

772
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:24,080
哦，你真是个傲慢的……
Oh, you're a patronising...!

773
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:26,320
不，朱蒂丝，我是实话实说。
No, Judith, I'm telling it to you like it is.

774
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:27,920
也许是时候有人这么做了。
It's possibly time someone did.

775
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,680
你曾经说过我有成为小说家的潜力。是的，我做到了!
You used to say I had a potential as a novelist. Yes, I did!

776
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:34,200
你仍然需要投入时间!
You still have to put the hours in!

777
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:37,960
你还得保持清醒足够长的时间才能真正把它写下来!
You still have to stay sober long enough to actually get it down in black and white!

778
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,920
你不能靠潜力来谋生!
You can't make a career and a living out of potential!

779
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:44,360
你得让它更上一层楼。
You've got to take it to the next level.

780
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:48,720
如果你明白我在说什么，并继续做下去，你最后可能会感谢我。
If you ever understand what I'm saying, and simply got on with it, you'd probably thank me in the end.

781
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:49,840
事实上……尿了!
As it is... Piss off!

782
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:51,400
完全正确。
Exactly.

783
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:57,040
如果……如果我曾经认为你真的在努力，我希望
If... If I ever did think you were genuinely making an effort, I hope -

784
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:59,400
我希望我能帮助你。
I HOPE - I would help you.

785
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:01,480
现在就是这样了。
As it is, that's it now.

786
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:17,880
我们应该起诉!
We should sue!

787
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:20,800
我是说，你们都担心死了。
I mean, you lot have been worried out of your minds.

788
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:24,560
我和艾伦都受到了创伤。疏忽!
Me and Alan's traumatised. It's negligence!

789
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:28,080
但是他们免费给你提供了婚礼场地?
But they've offered you the venue free of charge for the wedding?

790
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:32,120
嗯嗯。你不能接受这一点然后起诉他们，对吧?
Mm-hm. Well, you can't accept that and sue them, can you?

791
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:34,720
嗯,没有。
Well, no.

792
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:36,760
而且非常优雅。
And it is very classy.

793
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:42,280
不可能有那么多人能在那里结婚。
There can't be so many can afford to get married there.

794
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:44,880
这对教会来说是一件好事!
And it would be one in the eye for the church!

795
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:47,200
我们被拒绝了!我告诉过你吗?
We got turned down! Did I tell you?

796
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:49,400
我是说，你能相信吗?
I mean, can you believe it?!

797
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:54,160
我和艾伦小时候在教堂里受苦的时光。
The hours me and Alan have sat suffering in that church when we were kids.

798
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:57,280
现在我们连结婚的资格都没有了!
And now we don't even qualify to get wed in it!

799
00:45:58,360 --> 00:45:59,760
这是犯罪!
It's criminal!

800
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,160
你和保罗·贾特里有一腿吗!
You've been having a fling with Paul Jatri?!

801
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:10,600
你能相信吗?哦，他才15岁!
Can you believe it? Oh, he's only 15!

802
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:14,360
不，爸爸，那是违法的。他是22。
No, Dad, that would be illegal. He's 22.

803
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:17,200
是啊，你45岁了!你最近照镜子了吗?
Yeah, and you're 45! Have you looked in t'mirror lately?

804
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:20,200
这不是一时的冲动!只是……他笑着说
It wasn't a fling! It was just... HE LAUGHS

805
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:23,560
这一点都不好笑。真是一团糟!这就是为什么聪明的乞丐被逮捕了!
It's not funny. It's a mess! That's why clever beggar got arrested!

806
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:26,640
然后保罗的女朋友听到了风声
And then Paul's girlfriend got wind of it and...

807
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:28,240
他有女朋友了?!
He's got a girlfriend?!

808
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:30,360
他和尼尔·克雷斯韦尔的女儿订婚了!
He's engaged to Neil Creswell's lass!

809
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:33,680
她的哥哥们对他的虐待更甚!糟糕得多!
Her brothers have done him over even worse! A hell of a lot worse!

810
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:35,480
然后是我的土地……
Then there's my Land...

811
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:37,560
所以他才在楼上我的床上
That's why he's upstairs in my bed

812
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:40,560
腿断了，下巴断了，三根肋骨断了
with a broken leg, a bust jaw, three cracked ribs

813
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:44,160
一只手的手指都碎成了…鸡奸!
and the fingers on one hand all smashed to...buggery!

814
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:48,360
你能相信吗?他无处可去了!
Can you believe it? He's got nowhere else to go!

815
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:49,880
总是你挑的!
You always did pick 'em!

816
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:52,680
我已经跟他说清楚了，他没有…
I've made it clear to him, he hasn't...

817
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:56,960
在西莉亚面前做或说任何粗鲁或挑衅的话
to do or say anything crude or provocative in front of Celia,

818
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,960
我觉得他不会的
which I don't think he will.

819
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,960
他目前没有能力。哦，这是你的房子。
He's not capable at the minute. Oh, it's your house.

820
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,600
别这么说，爷爷!叫她把他甩了!
Don't say that, Granddad! Tell her to chuck him out!

821
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:06,560
你不是真的要和罗比分手吧?
You're not really stopping with Robbie?

822
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:10,040
嗯…我为什么要来这里?
Well...well, why would I want to be here?

823
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:14,240
我不介意她有男朋友，但为什么她就不能选一个a -不是白痴的呢，
I don't mind her having a boyfriend, but why can't she pick somebody who A - isn't a dickhead,

824
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:19,600
B -没有比她年轻300岁，C -没有和别人订婚!
B - isn't 300 years younger than she is, and C - wasn't engaged to somebody else!

825
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:22,360
所以我并不完美!我很惊讶这对你来说是个新闻!
So I'm not perfect! I'm amazed this is news to you!

826
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:25,560
我说过我是吗?!他叹了口气
Have I ever claimed to be?! HE SIGHS

827
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:31,400
哦!
Oh!

828
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:34,360
那家伙订婚了!
Fella that's engaged!

829
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:37,040
是的!好吧!把我钉在十字架上吧!
Yes! All right! So crucify me!

830
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:40,760
你还好吗?
Are you all right?

831
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:46,680
过几天我可能会去做手术。
I might pop down to t'surgery in the next few days.

832
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:51,320
约个时间，做个小检查。
Make a little appointment, just have a little check-up.

833
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:53,960
你是……?不，这不是……
Are you...? No, it's nowt...

834
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,320
这是一种刺痛。
It's a twinge.

835
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:57,920
昨晚有一两次。我现在就打电话。
Once or twice last night. I'll ring up now.

836
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:01,560
不，不，我来打。我将戒指。我将……等一下，安静点。
No, no, I'll ring. I'll ring. I'll...wait, while it's quieter.

837
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:03,920
爸爸。这是公牛。
Dad. It's nowt.

838
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:05,600
这是……这是压力。
It's... It's stress.

839
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:09,360
昨晚，我压力很大。
Last night, it was stressful.

840
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:11,440
我很好。我是。
I'm fine. I am.

841
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:14,120
我从来没有这么快乐过!
I've never been happier!

842
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:17,880
他笑了笑，这比任何药都好。
HE CHUCKLES That's better than any medicine.

843
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:20,520
你昨晚没带药，对吧?
You didn't have your pills on you last night, did you?

844
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:26,160
不…但我现在已经拿走了。你什么时候才能学会?无论你走到哪里，你都得带着它们。
No...but I've taken them now. When will you learn? You've got to take them with you, wherever you go.

845
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:29,040
尤其是现在有这么多…恶作剧
Especially now with all of these... shenanigans

846
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:32,040
你已经开始进入……。好吧，我会的。
you've started getting into... Up to. Right, well, I will.

847
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:33,880
答应我。我保证。
Promise me. I promise.

848
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:36,720
过几天就会有个混蛋冒出来。你现在在打电话，
And bugger popping down in t'next few days. You're ringing now,

849
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:38,600
等大家都走了。好吧。
as soon as everyone's gone. All right.

850
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:40,600
不。对吗?
No. Right, as in...?

851
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:42,840
是的，正确就是正确。
Yes, right as in right.

852
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:44,240
抱歉打扰一下。
Sorry to interrupt.

853
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:48,880
我要下车了。我今天下午应该设法开始工作。
I'm going to get off. I ought to try and get into work this afternoon.

854
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:53,000
我来照顾他们，你自己照顾好自己。
I'll look after 'em. You take care of yourself.

855
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:55,960
是的，我会的。和你。
Yeah, I will. And you.

856
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:05,440
不要沮丧。
Don't be depressed.

857
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:06,800
这是浪费时间。
It's a waste of time.

858
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:08,960
继续前进。
Just move on.

859
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:12,720
我知道说起来容易做起来难。
It's easier said than done, I know.

860
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:17,080
祝你好运…是的,很好。我们将会看到。
Good luck with, um... Yeah, well. We'll see.

861
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:24,840
安全驾驶!
Drive safely!

862
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:38,840
我会把他送到学校。你能保持清醒吗?
I'll drop him off at school. Will you be able to stay awake?

863
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:45,720
谢谢你…Robbie。
Thank you...Robbie.

864
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:25,280
我给你洗个热水澡。哦!
I'm running you a nice, hot bath. Oh!

865
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:27,320
我给你放了一些泡泡进去。
I put you some bubbles in.

866
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:28,840
哦。你喜欢泡泡吗?
Aw. Do you like bubbles?

867
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:31,120
我喜欢泡泡。它会温暖你的。
I love bubbles. It'll warm you through.

868
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:32,960
它将。
It will.

869
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,960
嗯，我是说洗个热水澡——一般要半个小时才能洗满，
Well, I say a nice hot bath - it generally takes half an hour to fill,

870
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,400
到那时，天气会稍微凉爽一些，但是……
by which time, it's slightly cooler, but...

871
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:39,840
它会很可爱的。
It'll be lovely.

872
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:42,240
我们有很多毛巾。
And we've got plenty towels.

873
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:44,800
好。我把你们俩放到暖气片上了
Good. I've put you two over t'radiator

874
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:47,440
我在浴室旁边给你装了个小收音机。
and I've set you up a little radio next to t'bath.

875
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:49,320
我把它放到二台。
I'll put it on Radio 2.

876
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:51,280
你喜欢二台吗?
It is Radio 2 you like?

877
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:52,920
我爱二台!
I love Radio 2!

878
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:56,080
我再给你沏点茶好吗?
Can I make you some more tea?

879
00:51:56,120 --> 00:51:59,200
不!我累坏了。
No! I'm all tea-ed out.

880
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:01,400
我给你煮一壶好咖啡!
I'll make you a nice pot of coffee!

881
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:04,720
然后你可以走出浴室，喝一杯热咖啡!
Then you can step out of the bath and have a cup of hot coffee!

882
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:07,600
你把我宠坏了。
You're spoiling me.

883
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:09,880
是的,嗯…
Yeah, well...

884
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:11,680
这是t 'plan。
that's t'plan.

885
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:14,000
所以你最好习惯它……
So you'd better get used to it...

886
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:15,600
Buttershaw夫人!
Mrs Buttershaw!

887
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:20,720
因为从现在开始，一切都将如此!
Because that's the way it's going to be from now on!

888
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:28,760
正确的。
Right.

889
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:51,240
嗨。
Hi.

890
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:53,880
嗨。你一定累坏了。
Hi. You must be exhausted.

891
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:56,280
你送孩子们上学了吗?
Did you send the boys to school?

892
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:59,080
不，他们都在电视机前睡着了。西莉亚怎么样?
No, they're both asleep in front of the telly. How's Celia?

893
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:00,560
好啊!
Fine!

894
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:02,680
有点——我不知道——摇晃。
A bit - I don't know - wobbly.

895
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:04,200
冲击,可能。
Shock, probably.

896
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:07,920
她想留在那里，所以…
She wanted to stay over there, so...

897
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:10,080
发生这种事很奇怪。
It's a weird thing to happen.

898
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:12,040
我给你煮点咖啡好吗?
Can I make you some coffee?

899
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:13,200
嗯…
Um...

900
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:18,640
不，谢谢。
No, thank you.

901
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:23,800
我要去睡一会儿，然后我可能…试着去工作。
I'm going to go to sleep for a bit, then I might...try and go into work.

902
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:26,760
今天肯定没人期待你来吧。
Oh, surely no-one's going to expect you in today.

903
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:29,200
我可以…吗?怎么啦？
Could I...? What?

904
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:31,640
我想说点什么，告诉你。
I wanted to say something, tell you something.

905
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:33,360
怎么啦？
What?

906
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:51,160
我讨厌我们之间出的问题。
I hate what's gone wrong between us.

907
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:53,600
我不知道你是否会原谅我，
I don't know if you're ever going to forgive me,

908
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:57,960
但我跟自己做了个约定再也不骗你了
but I made this deal with myself that I would never lie to you ever again.

909
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,960
或者以任何方式欺骗你，
Or deceive you in any way, shape or form,

910
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:05,640
希望有一天，你可能会……
in the hope that one day, you would possibly...

911
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:09,920
所以，我想让你知道，纯粹因为我觉得有责任，
So, I want you to know that purely because I felt responsible,

912
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:12,800
有罪，上帝知道……
guilty, God knows...

913
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:14,520
真替她难过，
sorry for her,

914
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:19,120
因为她太…可怜，我借给了
because she's so...pathetic, I lent -

915
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:23,520
我给了朱蒂丝一些房租钱。
gave - Judith some money for her rent.

916
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:27,280
什么时候? !今天早上，但我跟她说得很清楚了那东西是哪里来的。
When?! This morning, but I've made it clear to her there's no more where that came from.

917
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:31,200
而且——而且——我告诉过她我会把一切都告诉你的。
And - and - I've told her that I'd be telling you all about it.

918
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:34,440
她打电话来求我，
She rang up begging,

919
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:35,920
乞讨!
begging!

920
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:41,080
她几乎没有……把握生活的现实。
She's got almost no... grasp on the realities of life.

921
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:43,080
哇哇哇。可怜的贱人。
Aww. Poor bitch.

922
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:44,760
我希望她不存在。
I wish she didn't exist.

923
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:49,800
这样说别人是很糟糕的。
Which is a terrible thing to say about someone.

924
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:53,680
我一直在想。是吗?
I've been thinking. Yeah?

925
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:58,600
这在这里行得通。为了孩子们，我们可以礼貌点，不是吗?
This can work here. We can be civil, can't we, for the boys?

926
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:00,960
就像你说的，每个人都有空间。
And like you said, there's room for everyone.

927
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,880
确定。所以呢?
Sure. So?

928
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:06,320
我有男朋友了。
I'm seeing someone.

929
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:09,560
Y-Y-Y……嗯。
Y-Y-Y... Mmm.

930
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:11,160
你是谁?嗯。
You are? Mmm.

931
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:12,880
你吗?谁?
You? Who?

932
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:15,000
什么时候?这不是……
When? It's not...

933
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:18,800
我不知道这是不是我想要的，但是…
I don't know if it's what I want entirely yet, but...

934
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:24,160
我不试试就不知道。
I won't know if I don't try.

935
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:25,680
谁?
Who?

936
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:27,080
一个人。谁? !
Someone. Who?!

937
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:28,760
没关系!对我很重要!
It doesn't matter! Matters to me!

938
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:32,320
我不会告诉你是谁的，约翰，所以…她吹覆盆子
I'm not going to tell you who it is, John, so... SHE BLOWS RASPBERRY

939
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:34,560
工作上的人?可能。可能不是。
Someone at work? Possibly. Possibly not.

940
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:36,120
它是!你可能会这么想。
It is! You may think that.

941
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:37,840
我无法发表评论。
I couldn't possibly comment.

942
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:39,280
谁?我要去睡觉了。
Who? I'm going to bed.

943
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:41,760
谁? !约翰!谁? !这就是交易!
Who?! John! Who?! That's the deal!

944
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:43,920
等等，我又不是和你住在一个屋檐下
Hang on, I'm not living under the same roof as you

945
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:46,040
当你和别人在一起的时候!
while you're having it off with someone else!

946
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:48,240
你知道门在哪里。
Well, you know where the door is.

947
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:50,080
你在撒谎吗，卡罗琳?你在撒谎吗?!
Are you lying, Caroline? Are you lying?!

948
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:51,880
我不说谎!那是谁?!
I don't do lies! Well, who is it then?!

949
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:53,360
没有人!为什么这是秘密?!
No-one! Why's it a secret?!

950
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:56,840
因为我不想听你的任何意见
Because I don't want to have to listen to any of your opinions

951
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:59,960
还有评论和愚蠢的垃圾。
and comments and inane bloody rubbish.

952
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,240
所以是我认识的人!
So it's someone I know!

953
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:02,400
也许，也许不是!
Maybe, maybe not!

954
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:04,480
怎么回事?!什么都没有。
What's going on?! Nothing.

955
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:06,240
嗨,孩子们!
Hi, kids!

956
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:08,800
怎么了?
DOOR SLAMS What's up?

957
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:10,000
她的……怎么啦？
She's... What?

958
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:11,080
看到一个人。
Seeing someone.

959
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:12,920
妈妈?是的。
Mum? Yes.

960
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:15,000
妈妈? !是的!
Mum?! Yes!

961
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:17,560
谁?一些……我不知道!
Who? Some... I don't know!

962
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:21,800
她在学校里有和什么特别的人在一起吗?
Does she bother with anyone in particular at school?

963
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:33,240
不。别傻了!
No. Don't be stupid!

964
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:35,200
卡洛琳!
Caroline!

965
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:39,080
卡洛琳!
Caroline!

966
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:41,040
他敲门，卡洛琳!
HE KNOCKS ON DOOR Caroline!

967
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:42,640
来吧!开门!
Come on! Open the door!

968
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:46,520
你去哪儿了?我哪里没说过?你不能把他搬进来。
Where've you been? Where haven't I? You're not moving him in here.

969
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:48,400
我很高兴我们……谈过了。
I'm glad we...talked.

970
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:50,360
你想什么时候出去吃顿饭吗?
Do you fancy going out for a meal some time?

971
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:52,920
继续冒险!全体:我们在Soyland!
Keep having adventures! ALL: We're up Soyland!

972
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:55,280
我被利用了。
I've been used.

973
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:58,040
朱迪思?是的。注意你在哪里……
Judith? Yeah. Mind where you're...

974
00:56:58,080 --> 00:57:01,240
．.打到他的后牙。你不能把他留在这里!
..to the back teeth of him. You're not leaving him here!

975
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:02,760
他陷入困境都是你的错。
It's your fault he's in this mess.

976
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:04,680
嘿!那么你还没死。
Hey! You're not dead, then.

977
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:07,800
你想过找伴郎吗?我从来没当过伴郎。
Have you thought about a best man? I've never been a best man.

978
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:10,480
哦，我不知道约翰在哪里。
Oh, I haven't a clue where John is.

979
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:13,280
西莉亚!哦,上帝!发生了什么事? !
Celia! Oh, God! What's happened?!
