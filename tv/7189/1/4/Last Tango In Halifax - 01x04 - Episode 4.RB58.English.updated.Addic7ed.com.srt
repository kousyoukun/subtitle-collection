2
00:00:49,803 --> 00:00:52,522
It's all safe now.
Why don't you get back in t'warm?

3
00:00:52,523 --> 00:00:55,123
We'll get off. Bye. Thanks.

4
00:01:12,203 --> 00:01:15,603
'Hello, this is Alan Buttershaw.
Please leave your message
after the tone.'

5
00:01:16,923 --> 00:01:20,403
Dad, it's me... again, just to say...

6
00:01:22,803 --> 00:01:27,162
where are you, basically,
and did you get my last message,

7
00:01:27,163 --> 00:01:30,002
about picking up a takeaway? Cos...

8
00:01:30,003 --> 00:01:33,323
I've not been able to think about
cooking with all this going on.

9
00:01:34,483 --> 00:01:35,562
Bye.

10
00:01:35,563 --> 00:01:38,282
I so didn't need this happening
right now.

11
00:01:38,283 --> 00:01:39,841
You'll have to ring your insurance.

12
00:01:39,842 --> 00:01:41,443
They'll give me about 50 quid
for it.

13
00:01:42,803 --> 00:01:45,082
How the hell am I going to buy
another one?

14
00:01:45,083 --> 00:01:46,482
You can use my car.

15
00:01:46,483 --> 00:01:47,523
Thanks.

16
00:01:49,363 --> 00:01:53,722
How'd it start? Oh, they don't know -
lightning... electrical fault...

17
00:01:53,723 --> 00:01:56,243
You don't think someone torched it?

18
00:01:59,683 --> 00:02:00,722
Like who?

19
00:02:00,723 --> 00:02:04,122
Cresswells. Hailey's stupid brothers.

20
00:02:04,123 --> 00:02:06,043
I wish me dad would get home.

21
00:02:07,163 --> 00:02:10,243
They should've been here
over an hour since.

22
00:02:16,443 --> 00:02:18,082
Ooh!

23
00:02:18,083 --> 00:02:20,443
D'you know,
I've had some poor cards.

24
00:02:25,643 --> 00:02:28,123
Oh, there she goes again.

25
00:02:30,123 --> 00:02:31,442
# With her 'ead...

26
00:02:31,443 --> 00:02:33,642
# ...tucked underneath her arm

27
00:02:33,643 --> 00:02:37,482
♪ She walks the bloody tower! ♪

28
00:02:37,483 --> 00:02:39,003
We're in here, love!

29
00:02:42,363 --> 00:02:44,123
You're right, it'll be a draught.

30
00:02:45,363 --> 00:02:51,402
House this size, this old,
it'd be odd if it didn't creak
and make a few noises.

31
00:02:51,403 --> 00:02:55,002
Shall we make another expedition
to t'water closet after this hand?

32
00:02:55,003 --> 00:02:56,642
Mmm, can do.

33
00:02:56,643 --> 00:03:00,362
I don't know why that telephone
at reception won't work.

34
00:03:00,363 --> 00:03:03,322
It's obviously connected.

35
00:03:03,323 --> 00:03:05,683
I'm amazed we've not set off
an alarm.

36
00:03:12,203 --> 00:03:15,843
D'you think anyone's realised
that we're missing?

37
00:03:27,803 --> 00:03:30,762
She's just here, just now,
let me ask her. Caroline...

38
00:03:30,763 --> 00:03:32,922
What's all this mess? Dad's cooking.

39
00:03:32,923 --> 00:03:35,842
How was your exam? Good... ish.

40
00:03:35,843 --> 00:03:36,923
Answered everything?

41
00:03:36,924 --> 00:03:39,322
Mmm. No nasty surprises?

42
00:03:39,323 --> 00:03:41,002
Caroline, it's Gillian. Who?

43
00:03:41,003 --> 00:03:44,082
Slightly concerned cos she was under
the impression your mum and Alan

44
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:45,883
were due at hers and they've not
turned up.

45
00:03:45,884 --> 00:03:47,682
So? They're adults.

46
00:03:47,683 --> 00:03:49,722
Yes, but she was expecting them
at five.

47
00:03:49,723 --> 00:03:51,482
She's cooking for them, and...

48
00:03:51,483 --> 00:03:53,203
Do you want to talk to her?

49
00:03:59,723 --> 00:04:01,082
Gillian, hi!

50
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:03,922
I was just ringing to see
if they were with you, that's all.

51
00:04:03,923 --> 00:04:07,042
Er, no, their car's not here.
They're not here, I just looked.

52
00:04:07,043 --> 00:04:09,602
I got the idea they were
leaving here first thing.

53
00:04:09,603 --> 00:04:10,763
They did, I know. I...

54
00:04:10,764 --> 00:04:13,922
I just wondered if they'd gone back
to Harrogate for whatever reason.

55
00:04:13,923 --> 00:04:15,362
I don't think so.

56
00:04:15,363 --> 00:04:16,843
Has your mum got a mobile?

57
00:04:16,844 --> 00:04:19,402
Yes.
Would you mind ringing her for me?

58
00:04:19,403 --> 00:04:21,962
I don't mind 'em being late
just so long as they're all right.

59
00:04:21,963 --> 00:04:24,642
Sure. I'll get back to you,
give me a minute.

60
00:04:24,643 --> 00:04:26,482
Thank you. 'Bye.'

61
00:04:26,483 --> 00:04:27,523
Bye-bye.

62
00:04:30,403 --> 00:04:33,522
Why is she ringing you on your
mobile? Why? Well...

63
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:37,002
'Hello, this is Celia...' Shush!
'..Dawson. Please leave a message.'

64
00:04:37,003 --> 00:04:38,482
'Thank you.'

65
00:04:38,483 --> 00:04:39,723
Hi, Mum, it's me.

66
00:04:39,724 --> 00:04:42,843
Can you give me a ring when you get
this message, please? Thank you.
Bye.

67
00:04:43,963 --> 00:04:46,803
I, er, need Gillian's number.

68
00:04:49,323 --> 00:04:53,083
07700 900 827.

69
00:04:54,443 --> 00:04:58,162
I rang her to say thank you
for letting me stay at her house
after you drove off without me.

70
00:04:58,163 --> 00:05:00,481
I got her number from Alan
when he drove me over here.

71
00:05:00,482 --> 00:05:01,683
And you saved it.

72
00:05:01,684 --> 00:05:05,442
Well, yes, not, not, not...
You're transparent.

73
00:05:05,443 --> 00:05:07,202
'Hello?'

74
00:05:07,203 --> 00:05:09,522
Gillian, hi. I'm just getting
voice mail.

75
00:05:09,523 --> 00:05:12,162
'OK.' I'm sure they'll turn up.

76
00:05:12,163 --> 00:05:16,203
I just worry about me dad
having his pills on him, you know...

77
00:05:17,323 --> 00:05:18,363
for his heart.

78
00:05:18,364 --> 00:05:20,362
Oh, God, yeah, of course.

79
00:05:20,363 --> 00:05:23,602
'And he wouldn't not ring
if he knew he was going to be late,

80
00:05:23,603 --> 00:05:25,443
'when he knew I was
cooking for 'em.'

81
00:05:25,444 --> 00:05:26,563
He's just...

82
00:05:27,723 --> 00:05:30,562
He's polite, he's thoughtful.

83
00:05:30,563 --> 00:05:33,842
Has he any friends or relatives
they might have visited?

84
00:05:33,843 --> 00:05:36,802
Yeah. Yeah, I just thought
I'd try you first.

85
00:05:36,803 --> 00:05:38,482
I'll keep trying her number.

86
00:05:38,483 --> 00:05:39,722
Thanks.

87
00:05:39,723 --> 00:05:42,722
'Will you ring me?' Course.

88
00:05:42,723 --> 00:05:45,562
OK, bye. They've probably just
got carried away

89
00:05:45,563 --> 00:05:47,763
doing something
and forgotten to look at the clock.

90
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:50,002
Yeah, whatever. I'm cooking.

91
00:05:50,003 --> 00:05:51,683
Not for me. I don't want your filth.

92
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:55,122
You see, that's just...
I have a timetable.
I know what I'm cooking, when.

93
00:05:55,123 --> 00:05:58,442
That's the way you organise yourself
when you have two strapping
teenagers,

94
00:05:58,443 --> 00:06:01,002
a demanding, time-consuming,
full-time job,

95
00:06:01,003 --> 00:06:03,603
and a husband who dumps you
for an alcoholic.

96
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:07,483
What's happening with Granny?
Oh, er...

97
00:06:09,043 --> 00:06:12,282
Her and Alan haven't turned up at
Gillian's when they're supposed to,

98
00:06:12,283 --> 00:06:13,722
and... she's, er...

99
00:06:13,723 --> 00:06:15,123
worried about where they are.

100
00:06:17,403 --> 00:06:18,603
I'll get changed.

101
00:06:27,443 --> 00:06:29,762
Ee, it's got a grand flush,
that toilet.

102
00:06:29,763 --> 00:06:33,082
They built things properly,
didn't they, the Victorians?

103
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:35,842
Well, strictly speaking,
it's Georgian.

104
00:06:35,843 --> 00:06:38,562
1836, North Tower were completed...

105
00:06:38,563 --> 00:06:41,962
year before Victoria
ascended t'throne.

106
00:06:41,963 --> 00:06:45,202
Oh, very good.
"Main body of the house..."

107
00:06:45,203 --> 00:06:49,522
Here, I didn't know it were
this old - dates back to 1514!

108
00:06:49,523 --> 00:06:51,122
Oh, fancy!

109
00:06:51,123 --> 00:06:54,482
Yeah, it's a good job
we didn't try smashing a window.

110
00:06:54,483 --> 00:07:00,882
Stained glass is original medieval -
it's unique, it's priceless.

111
00:07:00,883 --> 00:07:01,923
Heck!

112
00:07:03,203 --> 00:07:06,802
There she blows.
I wish she wouldn't.

113
00:07:06,803 --> 00:07:08,603
We're in t'cludgie, missus!

114
00:07:16,203 --> 00:07:18,082
There's somebody up there.

115
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:19,123
Hello!

116
00:07:20,683 --> 00:07:23,322
Oh, shit!
No, no, no, we're all right.

117
00:07:23,323 --> 00:07:25,163
What are we going to do?

118
00:07:26,323 --> 00:07:27,403
Hello!

119
00:07:30,683 --> 00:07:33,083
We're going to go back up to
t'bedroom...

120
00:07:34,763 --> 00:07:37,683
and shut t'door... and play cards.

121
00:07:38,683 --> 00:07:40,962
Hello!

122
00:07:40,963 --> 00:07:44,883
We got shut in! We're not burglars!
We're pensioners!

123
00:07:46,123 --> 00:07:47,163
Hello!

124
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:52,803
What was that?

125
00:07:54,883 --> 00:07:55,922
Nothing.

126
00:07:55,923 --> 00:07:57,443
It's nothing.

127
00:08:00,323 --> 00:08:03,563
Are you all right? Gillian?

128
00:08:05,483 --> 00:08:08,603
I just want to know that he's
all right, that's all.

129
00:08:15,323 --> 00:08:17,202
Who were that? Her.

130
00:08:17,203 --> 00:08:18,923
Your mother. Who else?

131
00:08:19,963 --> 00:08:21,362
Mad bitch!

132
00:08:21,363 --> 00:08:23,122
Paul Jatri.

133
00:08:23,123 --> 00:08:25,202
I know! Paul bloody Jatri!

134
00:08:25,203 --> 00:08:26,762
I know! Why?

135
00:08:26,763 --> 00:08:28,162
God knows.

136
00:08:28,163 --> 00:08:30,602
No, really... you know, why?

137
00:08:30,603 --> 00:08:32,522
You're asking t'wrong person.

138
00:08:32,523 --> 00:08:36,162
Apart from t'fact that he's engaged
to Neil Cresswell's lass,

139
00:08:36,163 --> 00:08:38,962
he's got a mental age of
a blancmange. He's retarded.

140
00:08:38,963 --> 00:08:41,762
Well, probably not his brain
she's bothering with him for, is it?

141
00:08:41,763 --> 00:08:45,363
Bloody screw loose, I tell you,
she always has had. Yeah, all right!

142
00:08:47,003 --> 00:08:48,923
All right.

143
00:08:50,883 --> 00:08:52,202
Sorry.

144
00:08:52,203 --> 00:08:53,443
Sorry.

145
00:08:54,603 --> 00:08:57,202
Right, I'm going to drive over
to Halifax.

146
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:58,322
Really?

147
00:08:58,323 --> 00:09:02,122
Yeah. Why don't I give it
till nine o'clock?

148
00:09:02,123 --> 00:09:05,522
Yep, I'll give it till nine and if
we still haven't heard anything,
I'll...

149
00:09:05,523 --> 00:09:10,043
Do you want me to come with you,
Mum? No, no, you've got school
tomorrow.

150
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:18,962
Hello!

151
00:09:18,963 --> 00:09:20,762
Robbie, it's Gillian.

152
00:09:20,763 --> 00:09:22,362
Yeah, I thought it might be.

153
00:09:22,363 --> 00:09:25,642
Me dad hasn't turned up...
when he was supposed to,

154
00:09:25,643 --> 00:09:29,842
couple of hours ago now,
and I wanted to know
if Raff had seen him

155
00:09:29,843 --> 00:09:32,642
or had a phone call from him
or anything.

156
00:09:32,643 --> 00:09:35,002
'Is he there?'
Is that the best you can do?

157
00:09:35,003 --> 00:09:37,282
I'm sorry? 'Excuses for ringing up.'

158
00:09:37,283 --> 00:09:40,563
I'm not mucking about, Robbie.
He's got his heart problem.

159
00:09:42,323 --> 00:09:45,603
I just want to know if Raff's heard
from him. It's that simple.

160
00:09:47,643 --> 00:09:49,603
Raff? Mmm?

161
00:09:50,763 --> 00:09:53,403
Come on, summat about your granddad.

162
00:09:57,963 --> 00:10:00,042
What d'you want?

163
00:10:00,043 --> 00:10:02,243
Have you heard from Granddad
at all this evening?

164
00:10:02,244 --> 00:10:04,602
'No.' He's not rung you, or...?

165
00:10:04,603 --> 00:10:05,722
Why?

166
00:10:05,723 --> 00:10:08,922
'Because I was expecting him
at five for tea...

167
00:10:08,923 --> 00:10:10,802
'him and Celia -'

168
00:10:10,803 --> 00:10:12,283
and they've not turned up.

169
00:10:12,284 --> 00:10:15,322
Where were they last time you spoke?
In a cafe in Elland,

170
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:17,642
'two o'clock.'
Have you tried ringing him since?

171
00:10:17,643 --> 00:10:19,203
Course I've...!

172
00:10:21,003 --> 00:10:23,002
I'm ringing him every ten minutes.

173
00:10:23,003 --> 00:10:25,602
'So... Well, what are you
going to do?'

174
00:10:25,603 --> 00:10:28,563
I'll have to ring round
the hospitals, won't I?

175
00:10:29,563 --> 00:10:31,202
Well, do you want me to do owt?

176
00:10:31,203 --> 00:10:33,042
No.

177
00:10:33,043 --> 00:10:34,563
Do you want me to go looking
for him?

178
00:10:35,563 --> 00:10:36,843
No.

179
00:10:38,203 --> 00:10:40,083
Do you want me to come over?

180
00:10:41,283 --> 00:10:42,643
If you want.

181
00:10:43,803 --> 00:10:45,683
Is that twat still lying
on our settee?

182
00:10:45,684 --> 00:10:51,322
If you want to come over and
help me think about what to do next,

183
00:10:51,323 --> 00:10:52,683
'you'd be very welcome.'

184
00:10:54,683 --> 00:10:56,163
Have you done your homework?

185
00:11:04,923 --> 00:11:07,002
We should sue. You what?

186
00:11:07,003 --> 00:11:11,002
In the morning, when we get out
of this godforsaken hole,
we should sue.

187
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:15,082
This is entrapment.
Well, negligence.

188
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:17,043
I mean, what if someone...?

189
00:11:18,603 --> 00:11:22,162
Have you got your pills?
I'll be reet.

190
00:11:22,163 --> 00:11:23,803
Come on, get in.

191
00:11:26,003 --> 00:11:28,042
Happen they weren't footsteps.

192
00:11:28,043 --> 00:11:30,922
Happen... just sounds a house makes.

193
00:11:30,923 --> 00:11:33,282
A house this old, this big,

194
00:11:33,283 --> 00:11:34,842
can sound like... Yeah.

195
00:11:34,843 --> 00:11:37,163
Anything, anything you want it
to sound like.

196
00:11:38,563 --> 00:11:42,082
I don't believe in ghosts.
Neither do I.

197
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:45,642
I think once you've cashed your
chips - pfft! - that's it.

198
00:11:45,643 --> 00:11:47,603
Yeah...

199
00:11:48,603 --> 00:11:50,043
although...

200
00:11:51,643 --> 00:11:52,682
What?

201
00:11:52,683 --> 00:11:56,362
I've always thought there's more
between heaven and earth

202
00:11:56,363 --> 00:11:59,282
than any of us ever know about.

203
00:11:59,283 --> 00:12:00,883
Oh, well...

204
00:12:02,043 --> 00:12:03,203
Aye.

205
00:12:07,003 --> 00:12:11,403
Was that... candle on
that table... before?

206
00:12:19,763 --> 00:12:21,562
Have they turned up?

207
00:12:21,563 --> 00:12:24,682
No, they haven't. You don't have to
knock, you know, you can just
come in.

208
00:12:24,683 --> 00:12:25,963
Come in!

209
00:12:29,523 --> 00:12:32,442
What happened to t'Land Rover?
Blew up.

210
00:12:32,443 --> 00:12:35,002
How?
Lightning, electrical fault...

211
00:12:35,003 --> 00:12:37,882
or someone torched it. Torched it?!

212
00:12:37,883 --> 00:12:40,243
When? Just after you left.

213
00:12:42,003 --> 00:12:43,642
It were probably lightning.

214
00:12:43,643 --> 00:12:46,003
Well, how are you going to
manage...? I'll manage.

215
00:12:47,203 --> 00:12:51,042
Robbie thought we should come over,
help look for me granddad.

216
00:12:51,043 --> 00:12:54,002
Did he? Right, well...

217
00:12:54,003 --> 00:12:55,122
thanks.

218
00:12:55,123 --> 00:12:57,642
Have you reported it to t'police? No.

219
00:12:57,643 --> 00:13:00,162
Is that them?

220
00:13:00,163 --> 00:13:01,323
Is it?

221
00:13:02,683 --> 00:13:04,043
Doesn't look like.

222
00:13:06,163 --> 00:13:09,482
It's Harry and Maurice.
Your granddad's buddies.

223
00:13:09,483 --> 00:13:13,202
Do you think it's that serious?
Do you think I should report it
to the police?

224
00:13:13,203 --> 00:13:16,282
It's up to you.
I'm asking your advice.

225
00:13:16,283 --> 00:13:19,802
Well, you can report it
any time you like.

226
00:13:19,803 --> 00:13:23,042
There's a legitimate cause for
concern cos of his heart condition.

227
00:13:23,043 --> 00:13:24,882
Oh, God.

228
00:13:24,883 --> 00:13:26,083
D'you wanna...?

229
00:13:32,923 --> 00:13:34,802
You all right, love?

230
00:13:34,803 --> 00:13:38,002
I rang Silly Bugger but he's not
heard owt from 'em either.

231
00:13:38,003 --> 00:13:41,402
Good evening, Gillian.
I'm sure there's a perfectly simple
explanation.

232
00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:43,363
You'd hope so, wouldn't you?

233
00:13:44,363 --> 00:13:45,923
Cavalry's arrived.

234
00:13:47,443 --> 00:13:49,562
Tell you what. What?

235
00:13:49,563 --> 00:13:50,762
It's raining.

236
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:53,163
You all right, Raff, lad?
Not so bad.

237
00:13:54,363 --> 00:13:56,882
My God! What's happened to him?

238
00:13:56,883 --> 00:13:58,242
Eh?

239
00:13:58,243 --> 00:14:00,242
You all right, love? Er...

240
00:14:00,243 --> 00:14:03,282
So, what's the latest, Gillian?

241
00:14:03,283 --> 00:14:06,282
I've run round the hospitals,
but of course that doesn't mean

242
00:14:06,283 --> 00:14:09,562
they haven't gone off the side of
the road somewhere up in t'wilds,
but...

243
00:14:09,563 --> 00:14:10,843
Nay, they'll be right.

244
00:14:10,844 --> 00:14:14,442
How do you know he hasn't taken her
to some hotel somewhere

245
00:14:14,443 --> 00:14:17,602
for a wild night of
nudge-nudge wink-wink?

246
00:14:17,603 --> 00:14:20,242
It's all he thinks about.

247
00:14:20,243 --> 00:14:21,522
Is it 'ell.

248
00:14:21,523 --> 00:14:24,882
I don't know, that, Harry,
I just... I think he'd have rung me.

249
00:14:24,883 --> 00:14:27,242
So, at what stage do we report it
to the police?

250
00:14:27,243 --> 00:14:29,842
Well, Robbie's...
I've told her any time.

251
00:14:29,843 --> 00:14:31,442
Given his, er...

252
00:14:31,443 --> 00:14:34,322
I thought I'd leave it while 11,
and then...

253
00:14:34,323 --> 00:14:35,682
Nay. Get 'em rung.

254
00:14:35,683 --> 00:14:39,242
Well, I don't want to... overreact.

255
00:14:39,243 --> 00:14:43,042
You don't want to think the worst.
That's the thing.

256
00:14:43,043 --> 00:14:45,843
But... given his...

257
00:14:47,523 --> 00:14:51,163
They'll be grateful, t'police -
probably got bugger all else to do.

258
00:14:53,563 --> 00:14:56,322
Don't look at me like that.
I tell it like it is.

259
00:14:56,323 --> 00:15:01,202
Well, I would, but he has,
on occasion, been out supping
with you lot all hours

260
00:15:01,203 --> 00:15:04,202
before now,
then turned up talking gibberish

261
00:15:04,203 --> 00:15:07,162
with his trouser legs rolled up
and his coat on inside out.

262
00:15:07,163 --> 00:15:11,282
Yes, well, that was... unfortunate.

263
00:15:11,283 --> 00:15:14,363
It were his birthday!
What's up with you?

264
00:15:17,003 --> 00:15:21,522
Missing? No, just not turned up
when they were supposed to.

265
00:15:21,523 --> 00:15:23,522
So, well, where do you think
they are?

266
00:15:23,523 --> 00:15:27,442
I've got no idea!
Nobody does, that's...

267
00:15:27,443 --> 00:15:29,642
I'm sorry, Kate. I'm just...

268
00:15:29,643 --> 00:15:31,682
Wound up? Course you are.
That's all right.

269
00:15:31,683 --> 00:15:33,442
I'm sure she's absolutely...

270
00:15:33,443 --> 00:15:34,962
Course. Of course.

271
00:15:34,963 --> 00:15:39,282
She doesn't go out after dark,
as a rule, though, that's the thing.

272
00:15:39,283 --> 00:15:41,043
Her eyes aren't what they were,
and...

273
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:43,882
There'll be an explanation.

274
00:15:43,883 --> 00:15:46,602
Listen, ring me
if there's anything I can do.

275
00:15:46,603 --> 00:15:49,522
Or if you just want to talk
to someone.

276
00:15:49,523 --> 00:15:51,642
What were you ringing me for?

277
00:15:51,643 --> 00:15:54,002
Oh!

278
00:15:54,003 --> 00:15:56,243
It doesn't seem so important now.

279
00:15:57,363 --> 00:16:00,443
Just... you said we should go away.

280
00:16:01,483 --> 00:16:02,763
'For the weekend.

281
00:16:02,764 --> 00:16:05,362
'Together, somewhere, possibly.

282
00:16:05,363 --> 00:16:09,122
'And I wanted to know if you
meant it, and if you did, '

283
00:16:09,123 --> 00:16:11,523
if I should fix something up.

284
00:16:14,763 --> 00:16:16,962
Can we talk about it later?

285
00:16:16,963 --> 00:16:18,163
Yeah, of course.

286
00:16:43,723 --> 00:16:47,962
Hi. Is there any news? Me mum's
through there with Robbie talking
to a uniform.

287
00:16:47,963 --> 00:16:50,602
Are you Celia's lass?

288
00:16:50,603 --> 00:16:51,642
Yes, that's...

289
00:16:51,643 --> 00:16:53,762
Harry Wallace.

290
00:16:53,763 --> 00:16:55,122
This is Maurice Price.

291
00:16:55,123 --> 00:16:57,882
They're me granddad's pals. Ah.

292
00:16:57,883 --> 00:17:00,882
I hope your mother's not been
leading him astray. Been...?

293
00:17:00,883 --> 00:17:03,602
Shut up. Lass is worried.

294
00:17:03,603 --> 00:17:05,523
She knows I'm joking.

295
00:17:06,523 --> 00:17:09,522
I understand you're a doctor!

296
00:17:09,523 --> 00:17:11,482
I'm... Yeah.

297
00:17:11,483 --> 00:17:12,522
Is she?

298
00:17:12,523 --> 00:17:14,202
Will you look at my foot?

299
00:17:14,203 --> 00:17:17,842
Put your foot away.
I've got poor circulation.

300
00:17:17,843 --> 00:17:20,162
I'm not a medical doctor.

301
00:17:20,163 --> 00:17:22,522
What then, then? Chemistry.

302
00:17:22,523 --> 00:17:24,682
Chemistry, can they do that?

303
00:17:24,683 --> 00:17:26,562
Ignore him.

304
00:17:26,563 --> 00:17:27,722
He's rural.

305
00:17:27,723 --> 00:17:31,482
I've a hernia as well. I think it's
a hernia. Do you want to have a look?

306
00:17:31,483 --> 00:17:33,163
It's not really my...

307
00:17:34,283 --> 00:17:37,722
Do we know what's happening?
There's been no developments.

308
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:41,283
Why don't you sit down, love?

309
00:17:44,483 --> 00:17:47,042
Chemistry.

310
00:17:47,043 --> 00:17:50,002
Margaret Thatcher read chemistry
at Oxford.

311
00:17:50,003 --> 00:17:52,042
Yes, well, I was in
a different college.

312
00:17:52,043 --> 00:17:54,043
Yeah, and I'd be apologising an' all.

313
00:17:57,283 --> 00:17:59,762
What's happened? Nothing. Nothing.

314
00:17:59,763 --> 00:18:04,282
It were just, like I said
on t'phone, we decided
there was nothing to lose,

315
00:18:04,283 --> 00:18:08,683
reporting 'em missing
sooner rather than later, so...

316
00:18:09,883 --> 00:18:12,883
Are you all right?
Yeah. Yeah. Are you?

317
00:18:13,963 --> 00:18:15,722
Yeah.

318
00:18:15,723 --> 00:18:19,122
They've taken a description,
and they can...

319
00:18:19,123 --> 00:18:22,402
What are they going to do, Robbie?
Check when the bank cards
were last used,

320
00:18:22,403 --> 00:18:25,122
when their mobiles were last used.
And then we'll run

321
00:18:25,123 --> 00:18:27,562
an ANPR check on their vehicle.
What's that?

322
00:18:27,563 --> 00:18:30,562
Double Dutch. It's like vehicle
plate recognition.

323
00:18:30,563 --> 00:18:34,202
We can see where they were last
picked up on cameras.
See where they were heading.

324
00:18:34,203 --> 00:18:38,522
So when will we know anything?
As soon as we get authority from
upstairs to pursue it.

325
00:18:38,523 --> 00:18:42,642
The lad that we spoke to is going
straight up to see t'Super, so...

326
00:18:42,643 --> 00:18:43,843
Best thing we can...

327
00:18:43,844 --> 00:18:45,841
They said best thing we can do
is go home.

328
00:18:45,842 --> 00:18:47,723
They'll ring us when they know owt.

329
00:18:47,724 --> 00:18:49,962
Why don't you go home, lads?

330
00:18:49,963 --> 00:18:53,603
I'll ring you if I need you.
If there's any news.

331
00:19:04,723 --> 00:19:08,283
'Hello, this is Celia Dawson.
Please leave...'

332
00:19:13,643 --> 00:19:15,242
Who IS that?

333
00:19:15,243 --> 00:19:17,842
Paul... Jatri.

334
00:19:17,843 --> 00:19:20,082
He's an idiot.

335
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:22,682
Paul Jat...?
Is that the bloke you...?

336
00:19:22,683 --> 00:19:25,322
Yeah. But I didn't do that to him.

337
00:19:25,323 --> 00:19:27,482
I just bruised him.

338
00:19:27,483 --> 00:19:29,283
That was somebody else.

339
00:19:30,443 --> 00:19:31,842
Right.

340
00:19:31,843 --> 00:19:33,083
He's not popular.

341
00:19:34,643 --> 00:19:37,202
So what's... What's he doing here?

342
00:19:37,203 --> 00:19:39,642
That's a good question.

343
00:19:39,643 --> 00:19:41,483
Don't ask.

344
00:19:50,723 --> 00:19:52,563
What were you doing
with that dipstick?

345
00:19:52,564 --> 00:19:54,242
Don't start on me, I've enough on.

346
00:19:54,243 --> 00:19:55,602
I just...

347
00:19:55,603 --> 00:19:56,923
What I do is...

348
00:19:58,123 --> 00:19:59,403
You think I'm going to be a nun?

349
00:19:59,404 --> 00:20:02,082
No! No.
Eddie's been dead for ten years.

350
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:05,442
D'you seriously think I haven't
slept with other people since then?

351
00:20:05,443 --> 00:20:08,322
I just... What's it to you?

352
00:20:08,323 --> 00:20:10,163
I'm sorry.

353
00:20:11,803 --> 00:20:14,281
About all the unpleasantness
there's been between us.

354
00:20:14,282 --> 00:20:15,443
Unpleasantness?

355
00:20:15,444 --> 00:20:19,042
Trying to convince people
that I've got a screw loose?

356
00:20:19,043 --> 00:20:22,962
That I murdered my own husband?
Trying to make Raffy believe that?
I was lashing out.

357
00:20:22,963 --> 00:20:24,883
For ten years? I'm sorry.

358
00:20:26,323 --> 00:20:27,363
I just think...

359
00:20:28,563 --> 00:20:29,843
you let yourself down.

360
00:20:29,844 --> 00:20:33,763
Bothering with a streak
of... whatever, like him.

361
00:20:34,963 --> 00:20:36,442
You're better than that.

362
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:37,523
I thought...

363
00:20:40,043 --> 00:20:45,682
after Eddie died,
you of all people

364
00:20:45,683 --> 00:20:48,163
would help me, support me.

365
00:20:49,443 --> 00:20:51,443
Shit, I was wrong, wasn't it?

366
00:20:52,483 --> 00:20:55,322
D'you think I'm going to forget
what you tried to do to me?

367
00:20:55,323 --> 00:20:57,282
What you put me through?

368
00:20:57,283 --> 00:20:59,562
We could make an all-right team.

369
00:20:59,563 --> 00:21:04,043
You, me, an' Raff, couldn't we?

370
00:21:06,403 --> 00:21:07,962
Did you torch my Land Rover?

371
00:21:07,963 --> 00:21:09,482
No!

372
00:21:09,483 --> 00:21:11,443
If the Cresswells did, I will...

373
00:21:13,323 --> 00:21:14,683
I'll get 'em.

374
00:21:17,243 --> 00:21:19,123
That's...

375
00:21:20,723 --> 00:21:22,003
Um...

376
00:21:24,723 --> 00:21:27,523
I'm appreciating the apology,
Robbie.

377
00:21:36,843 --> 00:21:37,883
It's fine.

378
00:21:40,843 --> 00:21:42,522
Go to bed.

379
00:21:42,523 --> 00:21:45,402
I'll let you know the second we hear
owt.

380
00:21:45,403 --> 00:21:47,163
There's nowt any of us can do.

381
00:21:48,563 --> 00:21:51,883
Go shut your eyes at least,
you've got school tomorrow.

382
00:21:55,323 --> 00:21:56,762
Hello?

383
00:21:56,763 --> 00:21:57,923
Yes, it is.

384
00:21:59,003 --> 00:22:00,283
Oh, yeah.

385
00:22:01,283 --> 00:22:02,763
4.32, right.

386
00:22:04,243 --> 00:22:05,363
Towards Bradford?!

387
00:22:06,643 --> 00:22:08,522
Godley Lane?

388
00:22:08,523 --> 00:22:10,802
He doesn't know anybody
over that way.

389
00:22:10,803 --> 00:22:12,043
Hang on a minute.

390
00:22:12,044 --> 00:22:15,602
They were caught on camera,
or their registration number was.

391
00:22:15,603 --> 00:22:20,323
Driving up Godley Lane, the other
side of Halifax, towards Bradford.

392
00:22:21,323 --> 00:22:23,443
No further sightings. Right.
So you're...?

393
00:22:25,083 --> 00:22:29,042
They're concentrating on that area
round there initially.

394
00:22:29,043 --> 00:22:30,443
What is there around there?

395
00:22:30,444 --> 00:22:33,362
There's nothing, there's Southowram
Hall, that's about it.

396
00:22:33,363 --> 00:22:36,162
You can get married
at Southowram Hall. What's he said?

397
00:22:36,163 --> 00:22:38,682
He said you can get married
at Southowram Hall.

398
00:22:38,683 --> 00:22:40,683
They were looking for
a wedding venue.

399
00:23:24,843 --> 00:23:27,562
Are you and Mum still getting
divorced then now, or what?

400
00:23:27,563 --> 00:23:29,122
Oh, well...

401
00:23:29,123 --> 00:23:31,402
I'm afraid I don't know.

402
00:23:31,403 --> 00:23:32,683
Can't you win her round?

403
00:23:32,684 --> 00:23:35,962
Can't you... buy her some flowers
or something?

404
00:23:35,963 --> 00:23:38,202
Well, I had. Almost.

405
00:23:38,203 --> 00:23:40,402
Won her round. I think. And then...

406
00:23:40,403 --> 00:23:43,242
Don't you blame me. I wasn't!

407
00:23:43,243 --> 00:23:44,602
I wasn't.

408
00:23:44,603 --> 00:23:46,602
Although you did
get the wrong end of the stick.

409
00:23:46,603 --> 00:23:50,202
Yeah, well, if you hadn't
started seeing that... bitch
in the first place,

410
00:23:50,203 --> 00:23:53,962
there wouldn't be any wrong end
of any sticks for anybody
to get hold of, would there?

411
00:23:53,963 --> 00:23:58,442
Yeah, fine. Are we really going to
argue about this now? The point is,
you're not seeing Judith any more,

412
00:23:58,443 --> 00:24:00,363
so you don't need to get divorced
any more.

413
00:24:00,364 --> 00:24:04,282
No, the point is,
she can't trust him any more,
any further than she can throw him.

414
00:24:04,283 --> 00:24:08,322
So it's not just as naive and dumb
as saying, "Can't you buy her
some flowers?!"

415
00:24:08,323 --> 00:24:09,683
Piss off! Yeah, well, grow up!

416
00:24:09,684 --> 00:24:12,243
You grow up! Just calm down. Stop it!
Stop it.

417
00:24:13,283 --> 00:24:17,203
We're all worried about Gran,
and this isn't a good way to...

418
00:24:21,363 --> 00:24:23,163
I'm sure me and Mum can
sort things out.

419
00:24:23,164 --> 00:24:26,763
These things take time, sometimes,
that's all.

420
00:24:31,123 --> 00:24:32,803
And a bit of goodwill.

421
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:38,123
I'm sorry I inflicted my husband
on you the other day.

422
00:24:39,283 --> 00:24:42,762
Oh, well, don't apologise.

423
00:24:42,763 --> 00:24:45,722
I'm sorry my son got arrested
in front of you all...

424
00:24:45,723 --> 00:24:48,442
by his own...

425
00:24:48,443 --> 00:24:49,722
uncle.

426
00:24:49,723 --> 00:24:54,242
So he... Raff beat up the bloke
that's lying on your couch.

427
00:24:54,243 --> 00:24:56,762
Yeah. Yeah, he...

428
00:24:56,763 --> 00:24:58,683
He's Paul. He's...

429
00:24:59,843 --> 00:25:01,482
We're friends, me and Paul,

430
00:25:01,483 --> 00:25:04,322
and Raff got it into his head
that we were more than friends

431
00:25:04,323 --> 00:25:06,603
and he didn't like that. So he...

432
00:25:07,843 --> 00:25:10,923
Then someone else beat him up
even more? Yeah.

433
00:25:12,323 --> 00:25:15,442
His girlfriend's brothers got wind
of what'd been said,

434
00:25:15,443 --> 00:25:18,643
and, well,
they're a pretty unpleasant lot.

435
00:25:19,883 --> 00:25:24,603
Oh... He's got broken limbs
because of some misunderstanding?

436
00:25:28,483 --> 00:25:32,322
So, has everything settled down?

437
00:25:32,323 --> 00:25:36,042
Then? Now? Er, at your end?

438
00:25:36,043 --> 00:25:37,442
Or...?

439
00:25:37,443 --> 00:25:39,123
Oh! Er...

440
00:25:41,243 --> 00:25:43,202
Me and John.

441
00:25:43,203 --> 00:25:44,243
Yeah.

442
00:25:45,363 --> 00:25:46,803
It's beyond that.

443
00:25:50,043 --> 00:25:51,323
What did he tell you?

444
00:25:52,963 --> 00:25:54,443
Oh, that, er...

445
00:25:56,043 --> 00:25:57,762
he'd had a fling,

446
00:25:57,763 --> 00:25:59,802
and...

447
00:25:59,803 --> 00:26:02,122
Yeah, that he wished he hadn't.

448
00:26:02,123 --> 00:26:05,123
Really?
Mmm. And that he wanted just to...

449
00:26:07,003 --> 00:26:08,642
get back with you.

450
00:26:08,643 --> 00:26:12,882
Well, he'd do it again tomorrow
if he met someone else he wanted
to do it with.

451
00:26:12,883 --> 00:26:15,003
That's how sorry he is.

452
00:26:17,123 --> 00:26:19,043
Are you all right?

453
00:26:20,043 --> 00:26:21,443
Tired.

454
00:26:22,803 --> 00:26:24,802
Where the hell are they?!

455
00:26:24,803 --> 00:26:26,162
Sorry.

456
00:26:26,163 --> 00:26:28,482
I'm sorry. That helps no-one.

457
00:26:28,483 --> 00:26:33,283
No, you're all right. You're
worried. Have a drop of brandy.
Yes, actually.

458
00:26:55,843 --> 00:26:58,723
It wasn't, er, a misunderstanding.

459
00:27:00,883 --> 00:27:02,283
I...

460
00:27:04,483 --> 00:27:07,563
I don't know. I don't even know
why I'm telling you.

461
00:27:12,483 --> 00:27:15,962
Except that Raff doesn't generally
behave like that.

462
00:27:15,963 --> 00:27:19,442
He's... He's not a thug.
He's a grand lad.

463
00:27:19,443 --> 00:27:21,283
Better than I deserve.

464
00:27:23,043 --> 00:27:24,403
He's like my dad.

465
00:27:25,643 --> 00:27:26,803
He's got a big streak

466
00:27:26,804 --> 00:27:29,723
of something very decent
etched right through him.

467
00:27:31,763 --> 00:27:33,163
And I haven't.

468
00:27:34,603 --> 00:27:35,803
I'm a mess.

469
00:27:37,283 --> 00:27:38,682
Well, you know that.

470
00:27:38,683 --> 00:27:41,442
Put your finger on it
the first time you met me.

471
00:27:41,443 --> 00:27:46,123
I shouldn't have said that. It was
stupid. I didn't mean it, it was...

472
00:27:47,763 --> 00:27:49,163
I've been...

473
00:27:54,003 --> 00:27:55,963
I've been depressed.

474
00:27:57,363 --> 00:27:58,962
For months.

475
00:27:58,963 --> 00:28:00,682
Bottling things up and then...

476
00:28:00,683 --> 00:28:04,722
it comes out, and you say things -
silly, nasty, stupid things,

477
00:28:04,723 --> 00:28:07,203
things you don't even mean,
and it's since...

478
00:28:10,323 --> 00:28:11,803
It's since...

479
00:28:15,763 --> 00:28:18,962
I feel like I'm only just
holding my job down, most days,

480
00:28:18,963 --> 00:28:20,523
and that's...

481
00:28:22,003 --> 00:28:24,442
It's terrifying.

482
00:28:24,443 --> 00:28:27,483
Sorry, you don't need to know that,
either.

483
00:28:37,443 --> 00:28:38,763
Hello?

484
00:28:40,683 --> 00:28:42,282
They've found the car.

485
00:28:42,283 --> 00:28:45,802
In the car park above Southowram Hall
in Cumbry Wood.

486
00:28:45,803 --> 00:28:47,722
But not them?

487
00:28:47,723 --> 00:28:48,802
Hello?

488
00:28:48,803 --> 00:28:51,682
We're turning a good number of
officers out now.

489
00:28:51,683 --> 00:28:54,002
Is there anywhere at all
in the vicinity

490
00:28:54,003 --> 00:28:56,803
where you think they're most likely
to have gone?

491
00:28:58,123 --> 00:29:00,642
Can I help you? I'm the curator.
Your sergeant rang me.

492
00:29:00,643 --> 00:29:03,322
I got here as soon as I could.
Two pensioners?

493
00:29:03,323 --> 00:29:05,722
Are you the key holder, sir?
One of them.

494
00:29:05,723 --> 00:29:09,162
I can open up for you,
you're more than welcome,
but we weren't open yesterday.

495
00:29:09,163 --> 00:29:12,122
We don't open on a Monday.
We've had no visitors since Sunday.

496
00:29:12,123 --> 00:29:16,282
Can I ask, has either of them
been depressed at all lately?

497
00:29:16,283 --> 00:29:18,442
No! Not at all!

498
00:29:18,443 --> 00:29:21,482
Completely the opposite!
They're in love with each other.

499
00:29:21,483 --> 00:29:23,043
They've never been happier!

500
00:29:38,323 --> 00:29:40,762
Right, that's it.
Summat weird's happening.

501
00:29:40,763 --> 00:29:43,442
Why's the car there and them
not in it?

502
00:29:43,443 --> 00:29:46,642
And asking me if either of them
has been depressed lately?

503
00:29:46,643 --> 00:29:50,602
They're just trying to rule things
out, Gillian. It's routine.

504
00:29:50,603 --> 00:29:53,202
They're just trying to
think of the best way forward.

505
00:29:53,203 --> 00:29:56,562
There's nothing sinister about it.
He doesn't know 'em like you do.

506
00:29:56,563 --> 00:30:00,122
He's just trying to build up
a picture. He's just doing his job.

507
00:30:00,123 --> 00:30:02,562
Do you want to drive over there?
I wouldn't.

508
00:30:02,563 --> 00:30:05,042
Honestly,
you're best off here, in t'warm.

509
00:30:05,043 --> 00:30:08,202
You're only going to wind yourselves
up even more if you go over there.

510
00:30:08,203 --> 00:30:10,843
Let them get on with it.
They know what they're doing.

511
00:30:11,843 --> 00:30:16,002
Look, stuff like this happens...
every week.

512
00:30:16,003 --> 00:30:18,002
It's not unusual.

513
00:30:18,003 --> 00:30:20,602
Nine times out of ten,
there's a perfectly...

514
00:30:20,603 --> 00:30:25,722
Well, not necessarily
a rational explanation,
but there's an explanation.

515
00:30:25,723 --> 00:30:30,243
People turn up right as rain.
They're often embarrassed
there's been such a fuss!

516
00:30:31,243 --> 00:30:33,802
I just hope he's warm somewhere.

517
00:30:33,803 --> 00:30:37,163
Not out in this.
Why don't I go over there?

518
00:30:38,203 --> 00:30:41,442
I might find summat out.
And I can keep you up to date better.

519
00:30:41,443 --> 00:30:42,963
Do you want to?

520
00:30:44,003 --> 00:30:45,283
Yeah.

521
00:31:43,723 --> 00:31:46,723
It's very nice,
waking up to this every morning.

522
00:31:47,843 --> 00:31:49,842
Well, yeah.

523
00:31:49,843 --> 00:31:51,443
In summer.

524
00:31:52,763 --> 00:31:54,043
Me dad...

525
00:31:55,763 --> 00:32:00,562
was saying, how would you feel
if Celia came to live with us here?

526
00:32:00,563 --> 00:32:04,562
He was just speculating. I don't
think they've made a decision.

527
00:32:04,563 --> 00:32:09,242
And I said I'd be delighted,
but I don't know how she'd go on
in winter.

528
00:32:09,243 --> 00:32:11,962
Wind can knock you over.

529
00:32:11,963 --> 00:32:14,643
We had eight-foot snowdrifts
last year.

530
00:32:16,083 --> 00:32:19,723
No, I can't quite picture her
milking cows.

531
00:32:21,643 --> 00:32:23,842
I don't have any cows.

532
00:32:23,843 --> 00:32:25,083
Just sheep.

533
00:32:28,203 --> 00:32:30,642
I always wanted a farm.

534
00:32:30,643 --> 00:32:33,443
I don't know why.
I wasn't born into it.

535
00:32:35,723 --> 00:32:38,163
Was your husband? God, no!

536
00:32:39,523 --> 00:32:43,642
Biking and boozing
were his two big career choices.

537
00:32:43,643 --> 00:32:47,203
It was me that did all the wheeling
and dealing and finding out.

538
00:32:48,723 --> 00:32:51,883
He liked it. Well, he loved it.
But...

539
00:32:53,483 --> 00:32:54,722
Where is he?

540
00:32:54,723 --> 00:32:56,602
Dead.

541
00:32:56,603 --> 00:32:58,642
Ten years, this next time.

542
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:00,403
What happened?

543
00:33:01,723 --> 00:33:03,802
Smashed his skull
with a log splitter.

544
00:33:03,803 --> 00:33:05,803
Oh! In t'barn.

545
00:33:07,083 --> 00:33:08,162
Jesus.

546
00:33:08,163 --> 00:33:10,323
Bled to death.

547
00:33:11,603 --> 00:33:14,042
Which was just as well.

548
00:33:14,043 --> 00:33:16,643
He'd have had brain damage
if he'd survived.

549
00:33:18,363 --> 00:33:21,563
I found him. That was pleasant!

550
00:33:22,683 --> 00:33:24,243
Was it an accident?

551
00:33:25,883 --> 00:33:26,923
No.

552
00:33:30,003 --> 00:33:31,842
Oh, eh.

553
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:33,683
Sorry.

554
00:33:35,483 --> 00:33:37,323
Do you think they're dead? No.

555
00:33:39,603 --> 00:33:42,443
No, I don't think
we should assume that.

556
00:33:43,723 --> 00:33:47,122
He loves her, you know. So much.

557
00:33:47,123 --> 00:33:49,643
He's... It's beautiful.

558
00:33:51,203 --> 00:33:53,163
It's extraordinary.

559
00:33:58,003 --> 00:34:02,722
Whatever has happened,
he'll be looking after her.

560
00:34:02,723 --> 00:34:04,123
I know that.

561
00:34:05,163 --> 00:34:06,963
I know.

562
00:34:10,403 --> 00:34:11,803
It's bothered me, though.

563
00:34:13,923 --> 00:34:16,522
That thing about me mother...

564
00:34:16,523 --> 00:34:18,882
not passing on that message to him.

565
00:34:18,883 --> 00:34:20,483
From your mum.

566
00:34:23,803 --> 00:34:25,643
Because, you know, I suppose...

567
00:34:26,923 --> 00:34:31,043
you want to be able to think
that she'd have been happy for him.

568
00:34:32,443 --> 00:34:34,723
Meeting up with Celia
after all this time.

569
00:34:36,283 --> 00:34:37,963
He's been so...

570
00:34:40,283 --> 00:34:42,003
happy.

571
00:34:45,163 --> 00:34:48,123
But maybe she wouldn't have been.

572
00:34:50,123 --> 00:34:53,322
She were jealous enough to stop 'em
getting together in t'first place.

573
00:34:53,323 --> 00:34:55,602
Maybe she'd have been really...!

574
00:34:55,603 --> 00:34:58,443
She was a teenager
when she did that.

575
00:34:59,963 --> 00:35:03,562
She was the same age Raff is now -
nobody can hold that against her.

576
00:35:03,563 --> 00:35:04,843
But she deceived him...

577
00:35:06,443 --> 00:35:08,643
all their lives.

578
00:35:09,843 --> 00:35:11,762
And he's only just found out.

579
00:35:11,763 --> 00:35:13,603
And I think it's upset him.

580
00:35:15,483 --> 00:35:18,283
He hasn't said owt. No.

581
00:35:19,523 --> 00:35:24,082
If your dad hadn't married your mum,
and my mum hadn't married my dad,

582
00:35:24,083 --> 00:35:27,282
neither of us would be here, so...
Or we could've been sisters.

583
00:35:27,283 --> 00:35:30,363
Yeah, well that would have
been a... Disaster.

584
00:35:31,923 --> 00:35:35,963
I think we should be very grateful
to your mum on the quiet
for doing what she did.

585
00:35:37,003 --> 00:35:38,482
Yeah.

586
00:35:38,483 --> 00:35:40,963
Your parents were happy,
weren't they? Yeah, yeah!

587
00:35:40,964 --> 00:35:42,282
Well, then!

588
00:35:42,283 --> 00:35:44,283
They always seemed to be.

589
00:35:45,283 --> 00:35:46,403
Weren't yours?

590
00:35:47,523 --> 00:35:49,282
Well...

591
00:35:49,283 --> 00:35:51,602
that's what's so odd.

592
00:35:51,603 --> 00:35:55,883
She's suddenly such a different
person to the one I've known
for the last 45 years.

593
00:35:57,763 --> 00:36:01,923
It's suddenly like she's alive,
like I've never seen her before.

594
00:36:17,323 --> 00:36:20,563
Celia? Celia!

595
00:36:22,323 --> 00:36:24,202
Oh, I've been asleep.

596
00:36:24,203 --> 00:36:25,243
Ssh! Ssh!

597
00:36:28,123 --> 00:36:29,722
What time is it?

598
00:36:29,723 --> 00:36:31,922
Oh, it's twenty to eight!

599
00:36:31,923 --> 00:36:33,962
Oh, it's never!

600
00:36:33,963 --> 00:36:35,842
It is!

601
00:36:35,843 --> 00:36:38,682
Oh! Ooh, I'm stiff!

602
00:36:38,683 --> 00:36:40,002
Yeah.

603
00:36:40,003 --> 00:36:41,802
Come on.

604
00:36:41,803 --> 00:36:44,562
Are you all right? Yeah.

605
00:36:44,563 --> 00:36:46,402
I think so.

606
00:36:46,403 --> 00:36:47,922
Are you?

607
00:36:47,923 --> 00:36:50,683
Oh, I've no idea!

608
00:36:56,123 --> 00:37:00,683
I'm sure I shut that door
before we got back into bed.

609
00:37:03,283 --> 00:37:05,803
Oh, let's get out of here.

610
00:37:10,123 --> 00:37:12,882
I'm not optimistic.
Both in their 70s,

611
00:37:12,883 --> 00:37:14,483
out all night. Hello!

612
00:37:15,603 --> 00:37:17,762
We've been shut in!
Are you in charge?

613
00:37:17,763 --> 00:37:21,282
I, er...
We took some chocolate, we had to.

614
00:37:21,283 --> 00:37:23,562
I've left a £5 note by the till.

615
00:37:23,563 --> 00:37:25,842
Are you all right?
And I made the bed.

616
00:37:25,843 --> 00:37:28,283
You should have rung for help.
We couldn't make it work!

617
00:37:28,284 --> 00:37:31,442
And you can't get a signal on
t'mobile! You've to ring 9
for an outside line.

618
00:37:31,443 --> 00:37:34,722
Well, you should have it written
by the phone on a bit of card,

619
00:37:34,723 --> 00:37:36,922
then folk would know.
We weren't open yesterday.

620
00:37:36,923 --> 00:37:39,882
That door was. We had a delivery...

621
00:37:39,883 --> 00:37:43,002
About half past fourish? Oh, my God!

622
00:37:43,003 --> 00:37:45,002
We waited to buy tickets.

623
00:37:45,003 --> 00:37:48,282
Only nobody came, so we wandered
through there, looking for somebody.

624
00:37:48,283 --> 00:37:50,962
Yeah, and then we heard
the door slam. And that was that.

625
00:37:50,963 --> 00:37:53,763
I'm amazed we didn't
set t'alarm off.

626
00:37:56,043 --> 00:37:58,082
Oh, bloody hell.

627
00:37:58,083 --> 00:38:00,922
You couldn't get us an outside line
right now, could you?

628
00:38:00,923 --> 00:38:03,802
Only there'll be people
wondering where the heck we are!

629
00:38:03,803 --> 00:38:05,083
Yeah. There are.

630
00:38:05,084 --> 00:38:07,683
Half of West Yorkshire Police
are out looking for you!

631
00:38:11,883 --> 00:38:14,162
'What are you going to do
about work?'

632
00:38:14,163 --> 00:38:19,042
I've spoken to the deputy heads.
They can keep things afloat without
me for as long as, um...

633
00:38:19,043 --> 00:38:21,122
I thought we'd know something
by now.

634
00:38:21,123 --> 00:38:23,882
How are the boys?
I'm not sending Lawrence to school.

635
00:38:23,883 --> 00:38:27,482
William's not got any exams today
anyway, but neither of them
slept a wink.

636
00:38:27,483 --> 00:38:29,682
'Well, none of us have.' It's fine.

637
00:38:29,683 --> 00:38:32,122
Fine.

638
00:38:32,123 --> 00:38:34,282
Hello! Granddad!

639
00:38:34,283 --> 00:38:35,482
Oh, my God!

640
00:38:35,483 --> 00:38:36,723
Are you both all right?

641
00:38:36,724 --> 00:38:40,882
Mrs... Dr? Caroline's here.
She's been here all night with...

642
00:38:40,883 --> 00:38:43,563
Can I talk to her?
She wants to talk to Celia.

643
00:38:44,803 --> 00:38:45,962
Mum?

644
00:38:45,963 --> 00:38:48,522
Gillian! Mum!

645
00:38:48,523 --> 00:38:51,362
Gillian! Gillian!

646
00:38:51,363 --> 00:38:54,762
They're fine. They're fine!
They're absolutely fine.

647
00:38:54,763 --> 00:38:56,603
They got shut inside
Southowram Hall.

648
00:38:56,604 --> 00:38:59,122
They've been playing cards
and eating chocolate!

649
00:38:59,123 --> 00:39:00,283
Shut in?! Yeah!

650
00:39:00,284 --> 00:39:02,563
Didn't t'police think
to look in there first?!

651
00:39:06,923 --> 00:39:09,402
Oh, I'll kill him!

652
00:39:09,403 --> 00:39:10,962
Dozy...!

653
00:39:10,963 --> 00:39:16,483
Only he could go getting himself
in a...!

654
00:39:18,683 --> 00:39:20,643
Oh!

655
00:39:38,003 --> 00:39:40,082
OK, so, school.

656
00:39:40,083 --> 00:39:43,682
Mum says you don't have to go,
so I suggest bed, day off,
Xbox, possibly.

657
00:39:43,683 --> 00:39:46,162
Yes!
Go for it. Not you, obviously.

658
00:39:46,163 --> 00:39:47,842
You have to revise.

659
00:39:47,843 --> 00:39:50,843
I, sadly, have to go to
the supermarket.

660
00:40:01,243 --> 00:40:04,442
You'll be better off upstairs,
out of t'way.

661
00:40:04,443 --> 00:40:06,642
Where will you sleep? On t'settee.

662
00:40:06,643 --> 00:40:11,042
I'll hide your car in t'barn, then
if anybody comes looking for you...

663
00:40:11,043 --> 00:40:12,803
No, no, no.

664
00:40:14,283 --> 00:40:16,122
I'll tell 'em you're not here.

665
00:40:16,123 --> 00:40:18,483
OK?

666
00:40:25,803 --> 00:40:27,163
OK.

667
00:40:29,083 --> 00:40:30,562
Right...

668
00:40:30,563 --> 00:40:34,402
you... keep it quiet till I've had
a chance to explain to me dad

669
00:40:34,403 --> 00:40:37,082
what the bloody hell
you're doing here.

670
00:40:37,083 --> 00:40:38,962
Then... Ow!

671
00:40:38,963 --> 00:40:42,922
When I have, I don't want
any vulgar comments

672
00:40:42,923 --> 00:40:45,482
of any description
in front of Celia!

673
00:40:45,483 --> 00:40:47,762
Is that absolutely understood?

674
00:40:47,763 --> 00:40:51,682
Cos you'll be out on your arse
if you do, faster than you can say
"compound fracture".

675
00:40:51,683 --> 00:40:54,802
Now, is there anything I've said
you're having trouble with?

676
00:40:54,803 --> 00:40:58,403
Have you got me painkillers?

677
00:40:59,683 --> 00:41:02,082
I'll get you some water.

678
00:41:02,083 --> 00:41:05,442
I wish I'd have thought
to stick him in here sooner.

679
00:41:05,443 --> 00:41:06,843
Mum, they're here!

680
00:41:15,083 --> 00:41:17,802
What happened?! Oh!

681
00:41:17,803 --> 00:41:20,483
Shouldn't you be at work? Yes.

682
00:41:21,763 --> 00:41:26,002
Hey, whose car is that? We had
a full house last night trying to
work out where the hell you were.

683
00:41:26,003 --> 00:41:27,962
Hey! Is that our Land Rover?!

684
00:41:27,963 --> 00:41:29,243
It was hit by lightning.

685
00:41:29,244 --> 00:41:32,802
Are you all right?
Stiff, cold and muzzy-headed.

686
00:41:32,803 --> 00:41:35,802
I hope the police gave whoever
locked you in a rocket up their...

687
00:41:35,803 --> 00:41:37,562
Oh, that's guaranteed.

688
00:41:37,563 --> 00:41:40,282
We thought you'd eloped!
Eh, that's a good idea.

689
00:41:40,283 --> 00:41:42,482
Are you hungry?

690
00:41:42,483 --> 00:41:45,362
Oh, a nice cup of tea with a bit of
sugar, I think.

691
00:41:45,363 --> 00:41:48,202
Oh, we can do tea!
And he needs his pills!

692
00:41:48,203 --> 00:41:50,043
Hey, whose car did you say that were?

693
00:41:50,044 --> 00:41:53,202
Oh, it's, um... It's Paul Jatri's.

694
00:41:53,203 --> 00:41:55,242
Paul Jatri? Yeah!

695
00:41:55,243 --> 00:41:58,282
Yeah, he's... I'll get t'kettle on.

696
00:41:58,283 --> 00:41:59,563
How do you feel?

697
00:41:59,564 --> 00:42:02,643
Oh, like puke warmed up,
to quote our Lawrence.

698
00:42:09,203 --> 00:42:11,162
Hi. Ah.

699
00:42:11,163 --> 00:42:13,003
Sorry about this.

700
00:42:17,643 --> 00:42:18,723
Two months' rent.

701
00:42:18,724 --> 00:42:21,923
You really are very kind.

702
00:42:23,243 --> 00:42:25,962
John? Are you all right?

703
00:42:25,963 --> 00:42:28,882
Oh, didn't get much sleep last night.

704
00:42:28,883 --> 00:42:32,762
God, I didn't mean for you to get
panicky! I'm not blackmailing you!

705
00:42:32,763 --> 00:42:35,482
My mother-in-law went missing. Oh.

706
00:42:35,483 --> 00:42:37,082
Is she...? Fine. She's fine.

707
00:42:37,083 --> 00:42:38,562
She's absolutely fine.

708
00:42:38,563 --> 00:42:41,882
Oh, well, that's... good.

709
00:42:41,883 --> 00:42:46,962
I was thinking of asking Tim Hoskins
if I could have my old job back

710
00:42:46,963 --> 00:42:48,403
at the university library.

711
00:42:48,404 --> 00:42:50,962
Judith, it was Tim Hoskins
who asked you to leave.

712
00:42:50,963 --> 00:42:56,682
Yes, I know, but I thought,
if you could put a word in for me,

713
00:42:56,683 --> 00:42:58,842
if you told him
that I'm getting better

714
00:42:58,843 --> 00:43:00,602
and I'm dealing with it and...

715
00:43:00,603 --> 00:43:02,283
I imagine he's replaced you by now.

716
00:43:02,284 --> 00:43:04,522
Yes, but next time
there's a vacancy.

717
00:43:04,523 --> 00:43:06,282
Judith, no!

718
00:43:06,283 --> 00:43:09,682
I'm going to tell Caroline I've
given you that money, all right?

719
00:43:09,683 --> 00:43:13,442
And please, don't ask me for any
more. I think as regards employment,

720
00:43:13,443 --> 00:43:18,083
you're going to have to set your
sights on something more realistic.
For "realistic", read "menial"?!

721
00:43:19,923 --> 00:43:24,242
You WERE going to introduce me
to your publisher! Have you got
anything finished to show him?

722
00:43:24,243 --> 00:43:26,362
I've written another chapter,
that's four!

723
00:43:26,363 --> 00:43:30,843
Judith, I've explained this.
No-one's going to publish
a few chapters. I know that!

724
00:43:32,403 --> 00:43:35,522
And no-one's going to advance you
some money on the strength of them.

725
00:43:35,523 --> 00:43:37,562
Again, we come back
to living in the real world!

726
00:43:37,563 --> 00:43:39,162
Oh, you're a patronising...!

727
00:43:39,163 --> 00:43:41,402
No, Judith, I'm telling it to you
like it is.

728
00:43:41,403 --> 00:43:43,003
It's possibly time someone did.

729
00:43:44,043 --> 00:43:47,762
You used to say I had a potential
as a novelist. Yes, I did!

730
00:43:47,763 --> 00:43:49,283
You still have to put the hours in!

731
00:43:49,284 --> 00:43:53,042
You still have to stay sober
long enough to actually get it down
in black and white!

732
00:43:53,043 --> 00:43:57,002
You can't make a career and a living
out of potential!

733
00:43:57,003 --> 00:43:59,442
You've got to take it
to the next level.

734
00:43:59,443 --> 00:44:03,802
If you ever understand what I'm
saying, and simply got on with it,
you'd probably thank me in the end.

735
00:44:03,803 --> 00:44:04,923
As it is... Piss off!

736
00:44:04,924 --> 00:44:06,483
Exactly.

737
00:44:07,603 --> 00:44:12,122
If... If I ever did think you were
genuinely making an effort, I hope...

738
00:44:12,123 --> 00:44:14,482
I HOPE - I would help you.

739
00:44:14,483 --> 00:44:16,563
As it is, that's it now.

740
00:44:31,643 --> 00:44:32,962
We should sue!

741
00:44:32,963 --> 00:44:35,882
I mean, you lot have been worried
out of your minds.

742
00:44:35,883 --> 00:44:39,642
Me and Alan's traumatised.
It's negligence!

743
00:44:39,643 --> 00:44:43,162
But they've offered you the venue
free of charge for the wedding?

744
00:44:43,163 --> 00:44:47,202
Mm-hm. Well, you can't accept that
and sue them, can you?

745
00:44:47,203 --> 00:44:49,802
Well, no.

746
00:44:49,803 --> 00:44:51,843
And it is very classy.

747
00:44:53,803 --> 00:44:57,362
There can't be so many can afford
to get married there.

748
00:44:57,363 --> 00:44:59,962
And it would be one in the eye
for the church!

749
00:44:59,963 --> 00:45:02,282
We got turned down! Did I tell you?

750
00:45:02,283 --> 00:45:04,482
I mean, can you believe it?!

751
00:45:04,483 --> 00:45:09,242
The hours me and Alan have sat
suffering in that church
when we were kids.

752
00:45:09,243 --> 00:45:12,363
And now we don't even qualify
to get wed in it!

753
00:45:13,403 --> 00:45:14,843
It's criminal!

754
00:45:19,043 --> 00:45:22,242
You've been having a fling
with Paul Jatri?!

755
00:45:22,243 --> 00:45:25,682
Can you believe it?
Oh, he's only 15!

756
00:45:25,683 --> 00:45:29,442
No, Dad, that would be illegal.
He's 22.

757
00:45:29,443 --> 00:45:32,282
Yeah, and you're 45!
Have you looked in t'mirror lately?

758
00:45:32,283 --> 00:45:35,282
It wasn't a fling! It was just...

759
00:45:35,283 --> 00:45:38,642
It's not funny. It's a mess! That's
why clever beggar got arrested!

760
00:45:38,643 --> 00:45:41,722
And then Paul's girlfriend
got wind of it and...

761
00:45:41,723 --> 00:45:43,322
He's got a girlfriend?!

762
00:45:43,323 --> 00:45:45,442
He's engaged to Neil Creswell's lass!

763
00:45:45,443 --> 00:45:48,762
Her brothers have done him over
even worse! A hell of a lot worse!

764
00:45:48,763 --> 00:45:50,562
Then there's my Land...

765
00:45:50,563 --> 00:45:52,642
That's why he's upstairs in my bed

766
00:45:52,643 --> 00:45:55,642
with a broken leg, a bust jaw,
three cracked ribs

767
00:45:55,643 --> 00:45:59,243
and the fingers on one hand
all smashed to... buggery!

768
00:46:00,603 --> 00:46:03,442
Can you believe it?
He's got nowhere else to go!

769
00:46:03,443 --> 00:46:04,962
You always did pick 'em!

770
00:46:04,963 --> 00:46:07,762
I've made it clear to him,
he hasn't...

771
00:46:07,763 --> 00:46:12,042
to do or say anything crude
or provocative in front of Celia,

772
00:46:12,043 --> 00:46:14,042
which I don't think he will.

773
00:46:14,043 --> 00:46:17,042
He's not capable at the minute.
Oh, it's your house.

774
00:46:17,043 --> 00:46:19,682
Don't say that, Granddad!
Tell her to chuck him out!

775
00:46:19,683 --> 00:46:21,643
You're not really stopping
with Robbie?

776
00:46:21,644 --> 00:46:25,122
Well... well, why would I want
to be here?

777
00:46:25,123 --> 00:46:29,322
I don't mind her having a boyfriend,
but why can't she pick somebody
who A - isn't a dickhead,

778
00:46:29,323 --> 00:46:34,682
B - isn't 300 years younger than
she is, and C - wasn't engaged
to somebody else!

779
00:46:34,683 --> 00:46:37,442
So I'm not perfect!
I'm amazed this is news to you!

780
00:46:37,443 --> 00:46:40,643
Have I ever claimed to be?!

781
00:46:45,003 --> 00:46:46,482
Oh!

782
00:46:46,483 --> 00:46:49,442
Fella that's engaged!

783
00:46:49,443 --> 00:46:52,123
Yes! All right! So crucify me!

784
00:46:53,523 --> 00:46:55,843
Are you all right?

785
00:46:57,443 --> 00:47:01,763
I might pop down to t'surgery
in the next few days.

786
00:47:03,163 --> 00:47:06,402
Make a little appointment,
just have a little check-up.

787
00:47:06,403 --> 00:47:09,042
Are you...? No, it's nowt...

788
00:47:09,043 --> 00:47:10,402
It's a twinge.

789
00:47:10,403 --> 00:47:13,002
Once or twice last night.
I'll ring up now.

790
00:47:13,003 --> 00:47:16,642
No, no, I'll ring. I'll ring.
I'll... wait, while it's quieter.

791
00:47:16,643 --> 00:47:19,002
Dad. It's nowt.

792
00:47:19,003 --> 00:47:20,682
It's... It's stress.

793
00:47:20,683 --> 00:47:24,442
Last night, it was stressful.

794
00:47:24,443 --> 00:47:26,523
I'm fine. I am.

795
00:47:27,843 --> 00:47:29,202
I've never been happier!

796
00:47:29,203 --> 00:47:32,962
That's better than any medicine.

797
00:47:32,963 --> 00:47:35,602
You didn't have your pills on you
last night, did you?

798
00:47:35,603 --> 00:47:41,242
No... but I've taken them now.
When will you learn? You've got to
take them with you, wherever you go.

799
00:47:41,243 --> 00:47:44,122
Especially now with all of these...
shenanigans

800
00:47:44,123 --> 00:47:47,122
you've started getting into...
Up to. Right, well, I will.

801
00:47:47,123 --> 00:47:48,962
Promise me. I promise.

802
00:47:48,963 --> 00:47:51,802
And bugger popping down in t'next
few days. You're ringing now,

803
00:47:51,803 --> 00:47:53,683
as soon as everyone's gone.
All right.

804
00:47:53,684 --> 00:47:55,682
No. Right, as in...?

805
00:47:55,683 --> 00:47:57,922
Yes, right as in right.

806
00:47:57,923 --> 00:47:59,322
Sorry to interrupt.

807
00:47:59,323 --> 00:48:03,962
I'm going to get off. I ought to try
and get into work this afternoon.

808
00:48:03,963 --> 00:48:08,082
I'll look after 'em.
You take care of yourself.

809
00:48:08,083 --> 00:48:11,043
Yeah, I will. And you.

810
00:48:18,563 --> 00:48:20,522
Don't be depressed.

811
00:48:20,523 --> 00:48:21,882
It's a waste of time.

812
00:48:21,883 --> 00:48:24,043
Just move on.

813
00:48:25,083 --> 00:48:27,803
It's easier said than done, I know.

814
00:48:28,883 --> 00:48:32,163
Good luck with, um...
Yeah, well. We'll see.

815
00:48:38,843 --> 00:48:39,923
Drive safely!

816
00:48:51,123 --> 00:48:53,923
I'll drop him off at school.
Will you be able to stay awake?

817
00:48:58,923 --> 00:49:00,803
Thank you... Robbie.

818
00:50:36,803 --> 00:50:40,362
I'm running you a nice, hot bath.
Oh!

819
00:50:40,363 --> 00:50:42,402
I put you some bubbles in.

820
00:50:42,403 --> 00:50:43,922
Aw. Do you like bubbles?

821
00:50:43,923 --> 00:50:46,202
I love bubbles.
It'll warm you through.

822
00:50:46,203 --> 00:50:48,042
It will.

823
00:50:48,043 --> 00:50:51,042
Well, I say a nice hot bath -
it generally takes half an hour
to fill,

824
00:50:51,043 --> 00:50:53,482
by which time, it's slightly cooler,
but...

825
00:50:53,483 --> 00:50:54,922
It'll be lovely.

826
00:50:54,923 --> 00:50:57,322
And we've got plenty towels.

827
00:50:57,323 --> 00:50:59,882
Good.
I've put you two over t'radiator

828
00:50:59,883 --> 00:51:02,522
and I've set you up a little radio
next to t'bath.

829
00:51:02,523 --> 00:51:04,402
I'll put it on Radio 2.

830
00:51:04,403 --> 00:51:06,362
It is Radio 2 you like?

831
00:51:06,363 --> 00:51:08,003
I love Radio 2!

832
00:51:09,403 --> 00:51:11,162
Can I make you some more tea?

833
00:51:11,163 --> 00:51:14,282
No! I'm all tea-ed out.

834
00:51:14,283 --> 00:51:16,482
I'll make you a nice pot of coffee!

835
00:51:16,483 --> 00:51:19,802
Then you can step out of the bath
and have a cup of hot coffee!

836
00:51:19,803 --> 00:51:22,682
You're spoiling me.

837
00:51:22,683 --> 00:51:24,962
Yeah, well...

838
00:51:24,963 --> 00:51:26,762
that's t'plan.

839
00:51:26,763 --> 00:51:29,082
So you'd better get used to it...

840
00:51:29,083 --> 00:51:30,683
Mrs Buttershaw!

841
00:51:31,763 --> 00:51:35,803
Because that's the way
it's going to be from now on!

842
00:51:42,763 --> 00:51:43,843
Right.

843
00:52:04,563 --> 00:52:06,322
Hi.

844
00:52:06,323 --> 00:52:08,962
Hi. You must be exhausted.

845
00:52:08,963 --> 00:52:11,362
Did you send the boys to school?

846
00:52:11,363 --> 00:52:14,162
No, they're both asleep
in front of the telly. How's Celia?

847
00:52:14,163 --> 00:52:15,642
Fine!

848
00:52:15,643 --> 00:52:17,762
A bit - I don't know - wobbly.

849
00:52:17,763 --> 00:52:19,283
Shock, probably.

850
00:52:20,843 --> 00:52:23,002
She wanted to stay over there, so...

851
00:52:23,003 --> 00:52:25,162
It's a weird thing to happen.

852
00:52:25,163 --> 00:52:27,122
Can I make you some coffee?

853
00:52:27,123 --> 00:52:28,283
Um...

854
00:52:32,163 --> 00:52:33,722
No, thank you.

855
00:52:33,723 --> 00:52:38,882
I'm going to go to sleep for a bit,
then I might... try and go into work.

856
00:52:38,883 --> 00:52:41,842
Oh, surely no-one's going
to expect you in today.

857
00:52:41,843 --> 00:52:44,282
Could I...? What?

858
00:52:44,283 --> 00:52:46,722
I wanted to say something,
tell you something.

859
00:52:46,723 --> 00:52:48,443
What?

860
00:53:04,363 --> 00:53:06,243
I hate what's gone wrong between us.

861
00:53:06,244 --> 00:53:08,682
I don't know if you're ever going
to forgive me,

862
00:53:08,683 --> 00:53:13,042
but I made this deal with myself
that I would never lie to you
ever again.

863
00:53:13,043 --> 00:53:16,042
Or deceive you
in any way, shape or form,

864
00:53:16,043 --> 00:53:20,722
in the hope that one day,
you would possibly...

865
00:53:20,723 --> 00:53:25,002
So, I want you to know that
purely because I felt responsible,

866
00:53:25,003 --> 00:53:27,882
guilty, God knows...

867
00:53:27,883 --> 00:53:29,602
sorry for her,

868
00:53:29,603 --> 00:53:34,202
because she's so... pathetic, I lent...

869
00:53:34,203 --> 00:53:38,602
gave - Judith some money
for her rent.

870
00:53:38,603 --> 00:53:42,362
When?! This morning,
but I've made it clear to her
there's no more where that came from.

871
00:53:42,363 --> 00:53:46,282
And - and - I've told her
that I'd be telling you all about it.

872
00:53:46,283 --> 00:53:49,522
She rang up begging,

873
00:53:49,523 --> 00:53:51,002
begging!

874
00:53:51,003 --> 00:53:56,162
She's got almost no...
grasp on the realities of life.

875
00:53:56,163 --> 00:53:58,162
Aww. Poor bitch.

876
00:53:58,163 --> 00:53:59,843
I wish she didn't exist.

877
00:54:01,363 --> 00:54:04,882
Which is a terrible thing
to say about someone.

878
00:54:04,883 --> 00:54:08,762
I've been thinking. Yeah?

879
00:54:08,763 --> 00:54:13,682
This can work here. We can be civil,
can't we, for the boys?

880
00:54:13,683 --> 00:54:16,042
And like you said,
there's room for everyone.

881
00:54:16,043 --> 00:54:18,962
Sure. So?

882
00:54:18,963 --> 00:54:21,403
I'm seeing someone.

883
00:54:22,443 --> 00:54:24,642
Y-Y-Y... Mmm.

884
00:54:24,643 --> 00:54:26,242
You are? Mmm.

885
00:54:26,243 --> 00:54:27,962
You? Who?

886
00:54:27,963 --> 00:54:30,082
When? It's not...

887
00:54:30,083 --> 00:54:33,883
I don't know if it's
what I want entirely yet, but...

888
00:54:37,123 --> 00:54:39,242
I won't know if I don't try.

889
00:54:39,243 --> 00:54:40,762
Who?

890
00:54:40,763 --> 00:54:42,162
Someone. Who?!

891
00:54:42,163 --> 00:54:43,842
It doesn't matter! Matters to me!

892
00:54:43,843 --> 00:54:47,402
I'm not going to tell you
who it is, John, so...

893
00:54:47,403 --> 00:54:49,642
Someone at work?
Possibly. Possibly not.

894
00:54:49,643 --> 00:54:51,202
It is! You may think that.

895
00:54:51,203 --> 00:54:52,922
I couldn't possibly comment.

896
00:54:52,923 --> 00:54:54,362
Who? I'm going to bed.

897
00:54:54,363 --> 00:54:56,842
Who?! John! Who?!
That's the deal!

898
00:54:56,843 --> 00:54:59,003
Hang on, I'm not living
under the same roof as you

899
00:54:59,004 --> 00:55:01,122
while you're having it off
with someone else!

900
00:55:01,123 --> 00:55:03,322
Well, you know where the door is.

901
00:55:03,323 --> 00:55:05,161
Are you lying, Caroline?
Are you lying?!

902
00:55:05,162 --> 00:55:06,961
I don't do lies!
Well, who is it then?!

903
00:55:06,962 --> 00:55:08,443
No-one! Why's it a secret?!

904
00:55:08,444 --> 00:55:11,922
Because I don't want to have to
listen to any of your opinions

905
00:55:11,923 --> 00:55:15,042
and comments and
inane bloody rubbish.

906
00:55:15,043 --> 00:55:16,321
So it's someone I know!

907
00:55:16,322 --> 00:55:17,483
Maybe, maybe not!

908
00:55:17,484 --> 00:55:19,562
What's going on?! Nothing.

909
00:55:19,563 --> 00:55:21,322
Hi, kids!

910
00:55:21,323 --> 00:55:23,882
What's up?

911
00:55:23,883 --> 00:55:25,082
She's... What?

912
00:55:25,083 --> 00:55:26,163
Seeing someone.

913
00:55:26,164 --> 00:55:28,002
Mum? Yes.

914
00:55:28,003 --> 00:55:30,082
Mum?! Yes!

915
00:55:30,083 --> 00:55:32,643
Who? Some... I don't know!

916
00:55:33,843 --> 00:55:36,883
Does she bother with anyone
in particular at school?

917
00:55:44,643 --> 00:55:48,322
No. Don't be stupid!

918
00:55:48,323 --> 00:55:50,283
Caroline!

919
00:55:52,843 --> 00:55:54,162
Caroline!

920
00:55:54,163 --> 00:55:56,122
Caroline!

921
00:55:56,123 --> 00:55:57,723
Come on! Open the door!
