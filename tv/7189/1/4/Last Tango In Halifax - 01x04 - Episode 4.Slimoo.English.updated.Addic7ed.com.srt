2
00:00:49,303 --> 00:00:52,022
It's all safe now.
Why don't you get back in t'warm?

3
00:00:52,023 --> 00:00:54,623
We'll get off. Bye. Thanks.

4
00:01:11,703 --> 00:01:15,103
'Hello, this is Alan Buttershaw.
Please leave your message
after the tone.'

5
00:01:16,423 --> 00:01:19,903
Dad, it's me... again, just to say...

6
00:01:22,303 --> 00:01:26,662
where are you, basically,
and did you get my last message,

7
00:01:26,663 --> 00:01:29,502
about picking up a takeaway? Cos...

8
00:01:29,503 --> 00:01:32,823
I've not been able to think about
cooking with all this going on.

9
00:01:33,983 --> 00:01:35,062
Bye.

10
00:01:35,063 --> 00:01:37,782
I so didn't need this happening
right now.

11
00:01:37,783 --> 00:01:39,341
You'll have to ring your insurance.

12
00:01:39,342 --> 00:01:40,943
They'll give me about 50 quid
for it.

13
00:01:42,303 --> 00:01:44,582
How the hell am I going to buy
another one?

14
00:01:44,583 --> 00:01:45,982
You can use my car.

15
00:01:45,983 --> 00:01:47,023
Thanks.

16
00:01:48,863 --> 00:01:53,222
How'd it start? Oh, they don't know -
lightning... electrical fault...

17
00:01:53,223 --> 00:01:55,743
You don't think someone torched it?

18
00:01:59,183 --> 00:02:00,222
Like who?

19
00:02:00,223 --> 00:02:03,622
Cresswells. Hailey's stupid brothers.

20
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:05,543
I wish me dad would get home.

21
00:02:06,663 --> 00:02:09,743
They should've been here
over an hour since.

22
00:02:15,943 --> 00:02:17,582
Ooh!

23
00:02:17,583 --> 00:02:19,943
D'you know,
I've had some poor cards.

24
00:02:25,143 --> 00:02:27,623
Oh, there she goes again.

25
00:02:29,623 --> 00:02:30,942
# With her 'ead...

26
00:02:30,943 --> 00:02:33,142
# ...tucked underneath her arm

27
00:02:33,143 --> 00:02:36,982
♪ She walks the bloody tower! ♪

28
00:02:36,983 --> 00:02:38,503
We're in here, love!

29
00:02:41,863 --> 00:02:43,623
You're right, it'll be a draught.

30
00:02:44,863 --> 00:02:50,902
House this size, this old,
it'd be odd if it didn't creak
and make a few noises.

31
00:02:50,903 --> 00:02:54,502
Shall we make another expedition
to t'water closet after this hand?

32
00:02:54,503 --> 00:02:56,142
Mmm, can do.

33
00:02:56,143 --> 00:02:59,862
I don't know why that telephone
at reception won't work.

34
00:02:59,863 --> 00:03:02,822
It's obviously connected.

35
00:03:02,823 --> 00:03:05,183
I'm amazed we've not set off
an alarm.

36
00:03:11,703 --> 00:03:15,343
D'you think anyone's realised
that we're missing?

37
00:03:27,303 --> 00:03:30,262
She's just here, just now,
let me ask her. Caroline...

38
00:03:30,263 --> 00:03:32,422
What's all this mess? Dad's cooking.

39
00:03:32,423 --> 00:03:35,342
How was your exam? Good... ish.

40
00:03:35,343 --> 00:03:36,423
Answered everything?

41
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:38,822
Mmm. No nasty surprises?

42
00:03:38,823 --> 00:03:40,502
Caroline, it's Gillian. Who?

43
00:03:40,503 --> 00:03:43,582
Slightly concerned cos she was under
the impression your mum and Alan

44
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:45,383
were due at hers and they've not
turned up.

45
00:03:45,384 --> 00:03:47,182
So? They're adults.

46
00:03:47,183 --> 00:03:49,222
Yes, but she was expecting them
at five.

47
00:03:49,223 --> 00:03:50,982
She's cooking for them, and...

48
00:03:50,983 --> 00:03:52,703
Do you want to talk to her?

49
00:03:59,223 --> 00:04:00,582
Gillian, hi!

50
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:03,422
I was just ringing to see
if they were with you, that's all.

51
00:04:03,423 --> 00:04:06,542
Er, no, their car's not here.
They're not here, I just looked.

52
00:04:06,543 --> 00:04:09,102
I got the idea they were
leaving here first thing.

53
00:04:09,103 --> 00:04:10,263
They did, I know. I...

54
00:04:10,264 --> 00:04:13,422
I just wondered if they'd gone back
to Harrogate for whatever reason.

55
00:04:13,423 --> 00:04:14,862
I don't think so.

56
00:04:14,863 --> 00:04:16,343
Has your mum got a mobile?

57
00:04:16,344 --> 00:04:18,902
Yes.
Would you mind ringing her for me?

58
00:04:18,903 --> 00:04:21,462
I don't mind 'em being late
just so long as they're all right.

59
00:04:21,463 --> 00:04:24,142
Sure. I'll get back to you,
give me a minute.

60
00:04:24,143 --> 00:04:25,982
Thank you. 'Bye.'

61
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:27,023
Bye-bye.

62
00:04:29,903 --> 00:04:33,022
Why is she ringing you on your
mobile? Why? Well...

63
00:04:33,023 --> 00:04:36,502
'Hello, this is Celia...' Shush!
'..Dawson. Please leave a message.'

64
00:04:36,503 --> 00:04:37,982
'Thank you.'

65
00:04:37,983 --> 00:04:39,223
Hi, Mum, it's me.

66
00:04:39,224 --> 00:04:42,343
Can you give me a ring when you get
this message, please? Thank you.
Bye.

67
00:04:43,463 --> 00:04:46,303
I, er, need Gillian's number.

68
00:04:48,823 --> 00:04:52,583
07700 900 827.

69
00:04:53,943 --> 00:04:57,662
I rang her to say thank you
for letting me stay at her house
after you drove off without me.

70
00:04:57,663 --> 00:04:59,981
I got her number from Alan
when he drove me over here.

71
00:04:59,982 --> 00:05:01,183
And you saved it.

72
00:05:01,184 --> 00:05:04,942
Well, yes, not, not, not...
You're transparent.

73
00:05:04,943 --> 00:05:06,702
'Hello?'

74
00:05:06,703 --> 00:05:09,022
Gillian, hi. I'm just getting
voice mail.

75
00:05:09,023 --> 00:05:11,662
'OK.' I'm sure they'll turn up.

76
00:05:11,663 --> 00:05:15,703
I just worry about me dad
having his pills on him, you know...

77
00:05:16,823 --> 00:05:17,863
for his heart.

78
00:05:17,864 --> 00:05:19,862
Oh, God, yeah, of course.

79
00:05:19,863 --> 00:05:23,102
'And he wouldn't not ring
if he knew he was going to be late,

80
00:05:23,103 --> 00:05:24,943
'when he knew I was
cooking for 'em.'

81
00:05:24,944 --> 00:05:26,063
He's just...

82
00:05:27,223 --> 00:05:30,062
He's polite, he's thoughtful.

83
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:33,342
Has he any friends or relatives
they might have visited?

84
00:05:33,343 --> 00:05:36,302
Yeah. Yeah, I just thought
I'd try you first.

85
00:05:36,303 --> 00:05:37,982
I'll keep trying her number.

86
00:05:37,983 --> 00:05:39,222
Thanks.

87
00:05:39,223 --> 00:05:42,222
'Will you ring me?' Course.

88
00:05:42,223 --> 00:05:45,062
OK, bye. They've probably just
got carried away

89
00:05:45,063 --> 00:05:47,263
doing something
and forgotten to look at the clock.

90
00:05:47,264 --> 00:05:49,502
Yeah, whatever. I'm cooking.

91
00:05:49,503 --> 00:05:51,183
Not for me. I don't want your filth.

92
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:54,622
You see, that's just...
I have a timetable.
I know what I'm cooking, when.

93
00:05:54,623 --> 00:05:57,942
That's the way you organise yourself
when you have two strapping
teenagers,

94
00:05:57,943 --> 00:06:00,502
a demanding, time-consuming,
full-time job,

95
00:06:00,503 --> 00:06:03,103
and a husband who dumps you
for an alcoholic.

96
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:06,983
What's happening with Granny?
Oh, er...

97
00:06:08,543 --> 00:06:11,782
Her and Alan haven't turned up at
Gillian's when they're supposed to,

98
00:06:11,783 --> 00:06:13,222
and... she's, er...

99
00:06:13,223 --> 00:06:14,623
worried about where they are.

100
00:06:16,903 --> 00:06:18,103
I'll get changed.

101
00:06:26,943 --> 00:06:29,262
Ee, it's got a grand flush,
that toilet.

102
00:06:29,263 --> 00:06:32,582
They built things properly,
didn't they, the Victorians?

103
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:35,342
Well, strictly speaking,
it's Georgian.

104
00:06:35,343 --> 00:06:38,062
1836, North Tower were completed...

105
00:06:38,063 --> 00:06:41,462
year before Victoria
ascended t'throne.

106
00:06:41,463 --> 00:06:44,702
Oh, very good.
"Main body of the house..."

107
00:06:44,703 --> 00:06:49,022
Here, I didn't know it were
this old - dates back to 1514!

108
00:06:49,023 --> 00:06:50,622
Oh, fancy!

109
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:53,982
Yeah, it's a good job
we didn't try smashing a window.

110
00:06:53,983 --> 00:07:00,382
Stained glass is original medieval -
it's unique, it's priceless.

111
00:07:00,383 --> 00:07:01,423
Heck!

112
00:07:02,703 --> 00:07:06,302
There she blows.
I wish she wouldn't.

113
00:07:06,303 --> 00:07:08,103
We're in t'cludgie, missus!

114
00:07:15,703 --> 00:07:17,582
There's somebody up there.

115
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:18,623
Hello!

116
00:07:20,183 --> 00:07:22,822
Oh, shit!
No, no, no, we're all right.

117
00:07:22,823 --> 00:07:24,663
What are we going to do?

118
00:07:25,823 --> 00:07:26,903
Hello!

119
00:07:30,183 --> 00:07:32,583
We're going to go back up to
t'bedroom...

120
00:07:34,263 --> 00:07:37,183
and shut t'door... and play cards.

121
00:07:38,183 --> 00:07:40,462
Hello!

122
00:07:40,463 --> 00:07:44,383
We got shut in! We're not burglars!
We're pensioners!

123
00:07:45,623 --> 00:07:46,663
Hello!

124
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:52,303
What was that?

125
00:07:54,383 --> 00:07:55,422
Nothing.

126
00:07:55,423 --> 00:07:56,943
It's nothing.

127
00:07:59,823 --> 00:08:03,063
Are you all right? Gillian?

128
00:08:04,983 --> 00:08:08,103
I just want to know that he's
all right, that's all.

129
00:08:14,823 --> 00:08:16,702
Who were that? Her.

130
00:08:16,703 --> 00:08:18,423
Your mother. Who else?

131
00:08:19,463 --> 00:08:20,862
Mad bitch!

132
00:08:20,863 --> 00:08:22,622
Paul Jatri.

133
00:08:22,623 --> 00:08:24,702
I know! Paul bloody Jatri!

134
00:08:24,703 --> 00:08:26,262
I know! Why?

135
00:08:26,263 --> 00:08:27,662
God knows.

136
00:08:27,663 --> 00:08:30,102
No, really... you know, why?

137
00:08:30,103 --> 00:08:32,022
You're asking t'wrong person.

138
00:08:32,023 --> 00:08:35,662
Apart from t'fact that he's engaged
to Neil Cresswell's lass,

139
00:08:35,663 --> 00:08:38,462
he's got a mental age of
a blancmange. He's retarded.

140
00:08:38,463 --> 00:08:41,262
Well, probably not his brain
she's bothering with him for, is it?

141
00:08:41,263 --> 00:08:44,863
Bloody screw loose, I tell you,
she always has had. Yeah, all right!

142
00:08:46,503 --> 00:08:48,423
All right.

143
00:08:50,383 --> 00:08:51,702
Sorry.

144
00:08:51,703 --> 00:08:52,943
Sorry.

145
00:08:54,103 --> 00:08:56,702
Right, I'm going to drive over
to Halifax.

146
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:57,822
Really?

147
00:08:57,823 --> 00:09:01,622
Yeah. Why don't I give it
till nine o'clock?

148
00:09:01,623 --> 00:09:05,022
Yep, I'll give it till nine and if
we still haven't heard anything,
I'll...

149
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:09,543
Do you want me to come with you,
Mum? No, no, you've got school
tomorrow.

150
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:18,462
Hello!

151
00:09:18,463 --> 00:09:20,262
Robbie, it's Gillian.

152
00:09:20,263 --> 00:09:21,862
Yeah, I thought it might be.

153
00:09:21,863 --> 00:09:25,142
Me dad hasn't turned up...
when he was supposed to,

154
00:09:25,143 --> 00:09:29,342
couple of hours ago now,
and I wanted to know
if Raff had seen him

155
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:32,142
or had a phone call from him
or anything.

156
00:09:32,143 --> 00:09:34,502
'Is he there?'
Is that the best you can do?

157
00:09:34,503 --> 00:09:36,782
I'm sorry? 'Excuses for ringing up.'

158
00:09:36,783 --> 00:09:40,063
I'm not mucking about, Robbie.
He's got his heart problem.

159
00:09:41,823 --> 00:09:45,103
I just want to know if Raff's heard
from him. It's that simple.

160
00:09:47,143 --> 00:09:49,103
Raff? Mmm?

161
00:09:50,263 --> 00:09:52,903
Come on, summat about your granddad.

162
00:09:57,463 --> 00:09:59,542
What d'you want?

163
00:09:59,543 --> 00:10:01,743
Have you heard from Granddad
at all this evening?

164
00:10:01,744 --> 00:10:04,102
'No.' He's not rung you, or...?

165
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:05,222
Why?

166
00:10:05,223 --> 00:10:08,422
'Because I was expecting him
at five for tea...

167
00:10:08,423 --> 00:10:10,302
'him and Celia -'

168
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:11,783
and they've not turned up.

169
00:10:11,784 --> 00:10:14,822
Where were they last time you spoke?
In a cafe in Elland,

170
00:10:14,823 --> 00:10:17,142
'two o'clock.'
Have you tried ringing him since?

171
00:10:17,143 --> 00:10:18,703
Course I've...!

172
00:10:20,503 --> 00:10:22,502
I'm ringing him every ten minutes.

173
00:10:22,503 --> 00:10:25,102
'So... Well, what are you
going to do?'

174
00:10:25,103 --> 00:10:28,063
I'll have to ring round
the hospitals, won't I?

175
00:10:29,063 --> 00:10:30,702
Well, do you want me to do owt?

176
00:10:30,703 --> 00:10:32,542
No.

177
00:10:32,543 --> 00:10:34,063
Do you want me to go looking
for him?

178
00:10:35,063 --> 00:10:36,343
No.

179
00:10:37,703 --> 00:10:39,583
Do you want me to come over?

180
00:10:40,783 --> 00:10:42,143
If you want.

181
00:10:43,303 --> 00:10:45,183
Is that twat still lying
on our settee?

182
00:10:45,184 --> 00:10:50,822
If you want to come over and
help me think about what to do next,

183
00:10:50,823 --> 00:10:52,183
'you'd be very welcome.'

184
00:10:54,183 --> 00:10:55,663
Have you done your homework?

185
00:11:04,423 --> 00:11:06,502
We should sue. You what?

186
00:11:06,503 --> 00:11:10,502
In the morning, when we get out
of this godforsaken hole,
we should sue.

187
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:14,582
This is entrapment.
Well, negligence.

188
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:16,543
I mean, what if someone...?

189
00:11:18,103 --> 00:11:21,662
Have you got your pills?
I'll be reet.

190
00:11:21,663 --> 00:11:23,303
Come on, get in.

191
00:11:25,503 --> 00:11:27,542
Happen they weren't footsteps.

192
00:11:27,543 --> 00:11:30,422
Happen... just sounds a house makes.

193
00:11:30,423 --> 00:11:32,782
A house this old, this big,

194
00:11:32,783 --> 00:11:34,342
can sound like... Yeah.

195
00:11:34,343 --> 00:11:36,663
Anything, anything you want it
to sound like.

196
00:11:38,063 --> 00:11:41,582
I don't believe in ghosts.
Neither do I.

197
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:45,142
I think once you've cashed your
chips - pfft! - that's it.

198
00:11:45,143 --> 00:11:47,103
Yeah...

199
00:11:48,103 --> 00:11:49,543
although...

200
00:11:51,143 --> 00:11:52,182
What?

201
00:11:52,183 --> 00:11:55,862
I've always thought there's more
between heaven and earth

202
00:11:55,863 --> 00:11:58,782
than any of us ever know about.

203
00:11:58,783 --> 00:12:00,383
Oh, well...

204
00:12:01,543 --> 00:12:02,703
Aye.

205
00:12:06,503 --> 00:12:10,903
Was that... candle on
that table... before?

206
00:12:19,263 --> 00:12:21,062
Have they turned up?

207
00:12:21,063 --> 00:12:24,182
No, they haven't. You don't have to
knock, you know, you can just
come in.

208
00:12:24,183 --> 00:12:25,463
Come in!

209
00:12:29,023 --> 00:12:31,942
What happened to t'Land Rover?
Blew up.

210
00:12:31,943 --> 00:12:34,502
How?
Lightning, electrical fault...

211
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:37,382
or someone torched it. Torched it?!

212
00:12:37,383 --> 00:12:39,743
When? Just after you left.

213
00:12:41,503 --> 00:12:43,142
It were probably lightning.

214
00:12:43,143 --> 00:12:45,503
Well, how are you going to
manage...? I'll manage.

215
00:12:46,703 --> 00:12:50,542
Robbie thought we should come over,
help look for me granddad.

216
00:12:50,543 --> 00:12:53,502
Did he? Right, well...

217
00:12:53,503 --> 00:12:54,622
thanks.

218
00:12:54,623 --> 00:12:57,142
Have you reported it to t'police? No.

219
00:12:57,143 --> 00:12:59,662
Is that them?

220
00:12:59,663 --> 00:13:00,823
Is it?

221
00:13:02,183 --> 00:13:03,543
Doesn't look like.

222
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:08,982
It's Harry and Maurice.
Your granddad's buddies.

223
00:13:08,983 --> 00:13:12,702
Do you think it's that serious?
Do you think I should report it
to the police?

224
00:13:12,703 --> 00:13:15,782
It's up to you.
I'm asking your advice.

225
00:13:15,783 --> 00:13:19,302
Well, you can report it
any time you like.

226
00:13:19,303 --> 00:13:22,542
There's a legitimate cause for
concern cos of his heart condition.

227
00:13:22,543 --> 00:13:24,382
Oh, God.

228
00:13:24,383 --> 00:13:25,583
D'you wanna...?

229
00:13:32,423 --> 00:13:34,302
You all right, love?

230
00:13:34,303 --> 00:13:37,502
I rang Silly Bugger but he's not
heard owt from 'em either.

231
00:13:37,503 --> 00:13:40,902
Good evening, Gillian.
I'm sure there's a perfectly simple
explanation.

232
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:42,863
You'd hope so, wouldn't you?

233
00:13:43,863 --> 00:13:45,423
Cavalry's arrived.

234
00:13:46,943 --> 00:13:49,062
Tell you what. What?

235
00:13:49,063 --> 00:13:50,262
It's raining.

236
00:13:50,263 --> 00:13:52,663
You all right, Raff, lad?
Not so bad.

237
00:13:53,863 --> 00:13:56,382
My God! What's happened to him?

238
00:13:56,383 --> 00:13:57,742
Eh?

239
00:13:57,743 --> 00:13:59,742
You all right, love? Er...

240
00:13:59,743 --> 00:14:02,782
So, what's the latest, Gillian?

241
00:14:02,783 --> 00:14:05,782
I've run round the hospitals,
but of course that doesn't mean

242
00:14:05,783 --> 00:14:09,062
they haven't gone off the side of
the road somewhere up in t'wilds,
but...

243
00:14:09,063 --> 00:14:10,343
Nay, they'll be right.

244
00:14:10,344 --> 00:14:13,942
How do you know he hasn't taken her
to some hotel somewhere

245
00:14:13,943 --> 00:14:17,102
for a wild night of
nudge-nudge wink-wink?

246
00:14:17,103 --> 00:14:19,742
It's all he thinks about.

247
00:14:19,743 --> 00:14:21,022
Is it 'ell.

248
00:14:21,023 --> 00:14:24,382
I don't know, that, Harry,
I just... I think he'd have rung me.

249
00:14:24,383 --> 00:14:26,742
So, at what stage do we report it
to the police?

250
00:14:26,743 --> 00:14:29,342
Well, Robbie's...
I've told her any time.

251
00:14:29,343 --> 00:14:30,942
Given his, er...

252
00:14:30,943 --> 00:14:33,822
I thought I'd leave it while 11,
and then...

253
00:14:33,823 --> 00:14:35,182
Nay. Get 'em rung.

254
00:14:35,183 --> 00:14:38,742
Well, I don't want to... overreact.

255
00:14:38,743 --> 00:14:42,542
You don't want to think the worst.
That's the thing.

256
00:14:42,543 --> 00:14:45,343
But... given his...

257
00:14:47,023 --> 00:14:50,663
They'll be grateful, t'police -
probably got bugger all else to do.

258
00:14:53,063 --> 00:14:55,822
Don't look at me like that.
I tell it like it is.

259
00:14:55,823 --> 00:15:00,702
Well, I would, but he has,
on occasion, been out supping
with you lot all hours

260
00:15:00,703 --> 00:15:03,702
before now,
then turned up talking gibberish

261
00:15:03,703 --> 00:15:06,662
with his trouser legs rolled up
and his coat on inside out.

262
00:15:06,663 --> 00:15:10,782
Yes, well, that was... unfortunate.

263
00:15:10,783 --> 00:15:13,863
It were his birthday!
What's up with you?

264
00:15:16,503 --> 00:15:21,022
Missing? No, just not turned up
when they were supposed to.

265
00:15:21,023 --> 00:15:23,022
So, well, where do you think
they are?

266
00:15:23,023 --> 00:15:26,942
I've got no idea!
Nobody does, that's...

267
00:15:26,943 --> 00:15:29,142
I'm sorry, Kate. I'm just...

268
00:15:29,143 --> 00:15:31,182
Wound up? Course you are.
That's all right.

269
00:15:31,183 --> 00:15:32,942
I'm sure she's absolutely...

270
00:15:32,943 --> 00:15:34,462
Course. Of course.

271
00:15:34,463 --> 00:15:38,782
She doesn't go out after dark,
as a rule, though, that's the thing.

272
00:15:38,783 --> 00:15:40,543
Her eyes aren't what they were,
and...

273
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:43,382
There'll be an explanation.

274
00:15:43,383 --> 00:15:46,102
Listen, ring me
if there's anything I can do.

275
00:15:46,103 --> 00:15:49,022
Or if you just want to talk
to someone.

276
00:15:49,023 --> 00:15:51,142
What were you ringing me for?

277
00:15:51,143 --> 00:15:53,502
Oh!

278
00:15:53,503 --> 00:15:55,743
It doesn't seem so important now.

279
00:15:56,863 --> 00:15:59,943
Just... you said we should go away.

280
00:16:00,983 --> 00:16:02,263
'For the weekend.

281
00:16:02,264 --> 00:16:04,862
'Together, somewhere, possibly.

282
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:08,622
'And I wanted to know if you
meant it, and if you did, '

283
00:16:08,623 --> 00:16:11,023
if I should fix something up.

284
00:16:14,263 --> 00:16:16,462
Can we talk about it later?

285
00:16:16,463 --> 00:16:17,663
Yeah, of course.

286
00:16:43,223 --> 00:16:47,462
Hi. Is there any news? Me mum's
through there with Robbie talking
to a uniform.

287
00:16:47,463 --> 00:16:50,102
Are you Celia's lass?

288
00:16:50,103 --> 00:16:51,142
Yes, that's...

289
00:16:51,143 --> 00:16:53,262
Harry Wallace.

290
00:16:53,263 --> 00:16:54,622
This is Maurice Price.

291
00:16:54,623 --> 00:16:57,382
They're me granddad's pals. Ah.

292
00:16:57,383 --> 00:17:00,382
I hope your mother's not been
leading him astray. Been...?

293
00:17:00,383 --> 00:17:03,102
Shut up. Lass is worried.

294
00:17:03,103 --> 00:17:05,023
She knows I'm joking.

295
00:17:06,023 --> 00:17:09,022
I understand you're a doctor!

296
00:17:09,023 --> 00:17:10,982
I'm... Yeah.

297
00:17:10,983 --> 00:17:12,022
Is she?

298
00:17:12,023 --> 00:17:13,702
Will you look at my foot?

299
00:17:13,703 --> 00:17:17,342
Put your foot away.
I've got poor circulation.

300
00:17:17,343 --> 00:17:19,662
I'm not a medical doctor.

301
00:17:19,663 --> 00:17:22,022
What then, then? Chemistry.

302
00:17:22,023 --> 00:17:24,182
Chemistry, can they do that?

303
00:17:24,183 --> 00:17:26,062
Ignore him.

304
00:17:26,063 --> 00:17:27,222
He's rural.

305
00:17:27,223 --> 00:17:30,982
I've a hernia as well. I think it's
a hernia. Do you want to have a look?

306
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:32,663
It's not really my...

307
00:17:33,783 --> 00:17:37,222
Do we know what's happening?
There's been no developments.

308
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:40,783
Why don't you sit down, love?

309
00:17:43,983 --> 00:17:46,542
Chemistry.

310
00:17:46,543 --> 00:17:49,502
Margaret Thatcher read chemistry
at Oxford.

311
00:17:49,503 --> 00:17:51,542
Yes, well, I was in
a different college.

312
00:17:51,543 --> 00:17:53,543
Yeah, and I'd be apologising an' all.

313
00:17:56,783 --> 00:17:59,262
What's happened? Nothing. Nothing.

314
00:17:59,263 --> 00:18:03,782
It were just, like I said
on t'phone, we decided
there was nothing to lose,

315
00:18:03,783 --> 00:18:08,183
reporting 'em missing
sooner rather than later, so...

316
00:18:09,383 --> 00:18:12,383
Are you all right?
Yeah. Yeah. Are you?

317
00:18:13,463 --> 00:18:15,222
Yeah.

318
00:18:15,223 --> 00:18:18,622
They've taken a description,
and they can...

319
00:18:18,623 --> 00:18:21,902
What are they going to do, Robbie?
Check when the bank cards
were last used,

320
00:18:21,903 --> 00:18:24,622
when their mobiles were last used.
And then we'll run

321
00:18:24,623 --> 00:18:27,062
an ANPR check on their vehicle.
What's that?

322
00:18:27,063 --> 00:18:30,062
Double Dutch. It's like vehicle
plate recognition.

323
00:18:30,063 --> 00:18:33,702
We can see where they were last
picked up on cameras.
See where they were heading.

324
00:18:33,703 --> 00:18:38,022
So when will we know anything?
As soon as we get authority from
upstairs to pursue it.

325
00:18:38,023 --> 00:18:42,142
The lad that we spoke to is going
straight up to see t'Super, so...

326
00:18:42,143 --> 00:18:43,343
Best thing we can...

327
00:18:43,344 --> 00:18:45,341
They said best thing we can do
is go home.

328
00:18:45,342 --> 00:18:47,223
They'll ring us when they know owt.

329
00:18:47,224 --> 00:18:49,462
Why don't you go home, lads?

330
00:18:49,463 --> 00:18:53,103
I'll ring you if I need you.
If there's any news.

331
00:19:04,223 --> 00:19:07,783
'Hello, this is Celia Dawson.
Please leave...'

332
00:19:13,143 --> 00:19:14,742
Who IS that?

333
00:19:14,743 --> 00:19:17,342
Paul... Jatri.

334
00:19:17,343 --> 00:19:19,582
He's an idiot.

335
00:19:19,583 --> 00:19:22,182
Paul Jat...?
Is that the bloke you...?

336
00:19:22,183 --> 00:19:24,822
Yeah. But I didn't do that to him.

337
00:19:24,823 --> 00:19:26,982
I just bruised him.

338
00:19:26,983 --> 00:19:28,783
That was somebody else.

339
00:19:29,943 --> 00:19:31,342
Right.

340
00:19:31,343 --> 00:19:32,583
He's not popular.

341
00:19:34,143 --> 00:19:36,702
So what's... What's he doing here?

342
00:19:36,703 --> 00:19:39,142
That's a good question.

343
00:19:39,143 --> 00:19:40,983
Don't ask.

344
00:19:50,223 --> 00:19:52,063
What were you doing
with that dipstick?

345
00:19:52,064 --> 00:19:53,742
Don't start on me, I've enough on.

346
00:19:53,743 --> 00:19:55,102
I just...

347
00:19:55,103 --> 00:19:56,423
What I do is...

348
00:19:57,623 --> 00:19:58,903
You think I'm going to be a nun?

349
00:19:58,904 --> 00:20:01,582
No! No.
Eddie's been dead for ten years.

350
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:04,942
D'you seriously think I haven't
slept with other people since then?

351
00:20:04,943 --> 00:20:07,822
I just... What's it to you?

352
00:20:07,823 --> 00:20:09,663
I'm sorry.

353
00:20:11,303 --> 00:20:13,781
About all the unpleasantness
there's been between us.

354
00:20:13,782 --> 00:20:14,943
Unpleasantness?

355
00:20:14,944 --> 00:20:18,542
Trying to convince people
that I've got a screw loose?

356
00:20:18,543 --> 00:20:22,462
That I murdered my own husband?
Trying to make Raffy believe that?
I was lashing out.

357
00:20:22,463 --> 00:20:24,383
For ten years? I'm sorry.

358
00:20:25,823 --> 00:20:26,863
I just think...

359
00:20:28,063 --> 00:20:29,343
you let yourself down.

360
00:20:29,344 --> 00:20:33,263
Bothering with a streak
of... whatever, like him.

361
00:20:34,463 --> 00:20:35,942
You're better than that.

362
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:37,023
I thought...

363
00:20:39,543 --> 00:20:45,182
after Eddie died,
you of all people

364
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:47,663
would help me, support me.

365
00:20:48,943 --> 00:20:50,943
Shit, I was wrong, wasn't it?

366
00:20:51,983 --> 00:20:54,822
D'you think I'm going to forget
what you tried to do to me?

367
00:20:54,823 --> 00:20:56,782
What you put me through?

368
00:20:56,783 --> 00:20:59,062
We could make an all-right team.

369
00:20:59,063 --> 00:21:03,543
You, me, an' Raff, couldn't we?

370
00:21:05,903 --> 00:21:07,462
Did you torch my Land Rover?

371
00:21:07,463 --> 00:21:08,982
No!

372
00:21:08,983 --> 00:21:10,943
If the Cresswells did, I will...

373
00:21:12,823 --> 00:21:14,183
I'll get 'em.

374
00:21:16,743 --> 00:21:18,623
That's...

375
00:21:20,223 --> 00:21:21,503
Um...

376
00:21:24,223 --> 00:21:27,023
I'm appreciating the apology,
Robbie.

377
00:21:36,343 --> 00:21:37,383
It's fine.

378
00:21:40,343 --> 00:21:42,022
Go to bed.

379
00:21:42,023 --> 00:21:44,902
I'll let you know the second we hear
owt.

380
00:21:44,903 --> 00:21:46,663
There's nowt any of us can do.

381
00:21:48,063 --> 00:21:51,383
Go shut your eyes at least,
you've got school tomorrow.

382
00:21:54,823 --> 00:21:56,262
Hello?

383
00:21:56,263 --> 00:21:57,423
Yes, it is.

384
00:21:58,503 --> 00:21:59,783
Oh, yeah.

385
00:22:00,783 --> 00:22:02,263
4.32, right.

386
00:22:03,743 --> 00:22:04,863
Towards Bradford?!

387
00:22:06,143 --> 00:22:08,022
Godley Lane?

388
00:22:08,023 --> 00:22:10,302
He doesn't know anybody
over that way.

389
00:22:10,303 --> 00:22:11,543
Hang on a minute.

390
00:22:11,544 --> 00:22:15,102
They were caught on camera,
or their registration number was.

391
00:22:15,103 --> 00:22:19,823
Driving up Godley Lane, the other
side of Halifax, towards Bradford.

392
00:22:20,823 --> 00:22:22,943
No further sightings. Right.
So you're...?

393
00:22:24,583 --> 00:22:28,542
They're concentrating on that area
round there initially.

394
00:22:28,543 --> 00:22:29,943
What is there around there?

395
00:22:29,944 --> 00:22:32,862
There's nothing, there's Southowram
Hall, that's about it.

396
00:22:32,863 --> 00:22:35,662
You can get married
at Southowram Hall. What's he said?

397
00:22:35,663 --> 00:22:38,182
He said you can get married
at Southowram Hall.

398
00:22:38,183 --> 00:22:40,183
They were looking for
a wedding venue.

399
00:23:24,343 --> 00:23:27,062
Are you and Mum still getting
divorced then now, or what?

400
00:23:27,063 --> 00:23:28,622
Oh, well...

401
00:23:28,623 --> 00:23:30,902
I'm afraid I don't know.

402
00:23:30,903 --> 00:23:32,183
Can't you win her round?

403
00:23:32,184 --> 00:23:35,462
Can't you... buy her some flowers
or something?

404
00:23:35,463 --> 00:23:37,702
Well, I had. Almost.

405
00:23:37,703 --> 00:23:39,902
Won her round. I think. And then...

406
00:23:39,903 --> 00:23:42,742
Don't you blame me. I wasn't!

407
00:23:42,743 --> 00:23:44,102
I wasn't.

408
00:23:44,103 --> 00:23:46,102
Although you did
get the wrong end of the stick.

409
00:23:46,103 --> 00:23:49,702
Yeah, well, if you hadn't
started seeing that... bitch
in the first place,

410
00:23:49,703 --> 00:23:53,462
there wouldn't be any wrong end
of any sticks for anybody
to get hold of, would there?

411
00:23:53,463 --> 00:23:57,942
Yeah, fine. Are we really going to
argue about this now? The point is,
you're not seeing Judith any more,

412
00:23:57,943 --> 00:23:59,863
so you don't need to get divorced
any more.

413
00:23:59,864 --> 00:24:03,782
No, the point is,
she can't trust him any more,
any further than she can throw him.

414
00:24:03,783 --> 00:24:07,822
So it's not just as naive and dumb
as saying, "Can't you buy her
some flowers?!"

415
00:24:07,823 --> 00:24:09,183
Piss off! Yeah, well, grow up!

416
00:24:09,184 --> 00:24:11,743
You grow up! Just calm down. Stop it!
Stop it.

417
00:24:12,783 --> 00:24:16,703
We're all worried about Gran,
and this isn't a good way to...

418
00:24:20,863 --> 00:24:22,663
I'm sure me and Mum can
sort things out.

419
00:24:22,664 --> 00:24:26,263
These things take time, sometimes,
that's all.

420
00:24:30,623 --> 00:24:32,303
And a bit of goodwill.

421
00:24:34,223 --> 00:24:37,623
I'm sorry I inflicted my husband
on you the other day.

422
00:24:38,783 --> 00:24:42,262
Oh, well, don't apologise.

423
00:24:42,263 --> 00:24:45,222
I'm sorry my son got arrested
in front of you all...

424
00:24:45,223 --> 00:24:47,942
by his own...

425
00:24:47,943 --> 00:24:49,222
uncle.

426
00:24:49,223 --> 00:24:53,742
So he... Raff beat up the bloke
that's lying on your couch.

427
00:24:53,743 --> 00:24:56,262
Yeah. Yeah, he...

428
00:24:56,263 --> 00:24:58,183
He's Paul. He's...

429
00:24:59,343 --> 00:25:00,982
We're friends, me and Paul,

430
00:25:00,983 --> 00:25:03,822
and Raff got it into his head
that we were more than friends

431
00:25:03,823 --> 00:25:06,103
and he didn't like that. So he...

432
00:25:07,343 --> 00:25:10,423
Then someone else beat him up
even more? Yeah.

433
00:25:11,823 --> 00:25:14,942
His girlfriend's brothers got wind
of what'd been said,

434
00:25:14,943 --> 00:25:18,143
and, well,
they're a pretty unpleasant lot.

435
00:25:19,383 --> 00:25:24,103
Oh... He's got broken limbs
because of some misunderstanding?

436
00:25:27,983 --> 00:25:31,822
So, has everything settled down?

437
00:25:31,823 --> 00:25:35,542
Then? Now? Er, at your end?

438
00:25:35,543 --> 00:25:36,942
Or...?

439
00:25:36,943 --> 00:25:38,623
Oh! Er...

440
00:25:40,743 --> 00:25:42,702
Me and John.

441
00:25:42,703 --> 00:25:43,743
Yeah.

442
00:25:44,863 --> 00:25:46,303
It's beyond that.

443
00:25:49,543 --> 00:25:50,823
What did he tell you?

444
00:25:52,463 --> 00:25:53,943
Oh, that, er...

445
00:25:55,543 --> 00:25:57,262
he'd had a fling,

446
00:25:57,263 --> 00:25:59,302
and...

447
00:25:59,303 --> 00:26:01,622
Yeah, that he wished he hadn't.

448
00:26:01,623 --> 00:26:04,623
Really?
Mmm. And that he wanted just to...

449
00:26:06,503 --> 00:26:08,142
get back with you.

450
00:26:08,143 --> 00:26:12,382
Well, he'd do it again tomorrow
if he met someone else he wanted
to do it with.

451
00:26:12,383 --> 00:26:14,503
That's how sorry he is.

452
00:26:16,623 --> 00:26:18,543
Are you all right?

453
00:26:19,543 --> 00:26:20,943
Tired.

454
00:26:22,303 --> 00:26:24,302
Where the hell are they?!

455
00:26:24,303 --> 00:26:25,662
Sorry.

456
00:26:25,663 --> 00:26:27,982
I'm sorry. That helps no-one.

457
00:26:27,983 --> 00:26:32,783
No, you're all right. You're
worried. Have a drop of brandy.
Yes, actually.

458
00:26:55,343 --> 00:26:58,223
It wasn't, er, a misunderstanding.

459
00:27:00,383 --> 00:27:01,783
I...

460
00:27:03,983 --> 00:27:07,063
I don't know. I don't even know
why I'm telling you.

461
00:27:11,983 --> 00:27:15,462
Except that Raff doesn't generally
behave like that.

462
00:27:15,463 --> 00:27:18,942
He's... He's not a thug.
He's a grand lad.

463
00:27:18,943 --> 00:27:20,783
Better than I deserve.

464
00:27:22,543 --> 00:27:23,903
He's like my dad.

465
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:26,303
He's got a big streak

466
00:27:26,304 --> 00:27:29,223
of something very decent
etched right through him.

467
00:27:31,263 --> 00:27:32,663
And I haven't.

468
00:27:34,103 --> 00:27:35,303
I'm a mess.

469
00:27:36,783 --> 00:27:38,182
Well, you know that.

470
00:27:38,183 --> 00:27:40,942
Put your finger on it
the first time you met me.

471
00:27:40,943 --> 00:27:45,623
I shouldn't have said that. It was
stupid. I didn't mean it, it was...

472
00:27:47,263 --> 00:27:48,663
I've been...

473
00:27:53,503 --> 00:27:55,463
I've been depressed.

474
00:27:56,863 --> 00:27:58,462
For months.

475
00:27:58,463 --> 00:28:00,182
Bottling things up and then...

476
00:28:00,183 --> 00:28:04,222
it comes out, and you say things -
silly, nasty, stupid things,

477
00:28:04,223 --> 00:28:06,703
things you don't even mean,
and it's since...

478
00:28:09,823 --> 00:28:11,303
It's since...

479
00:28:15,263 --> 00:28:18,462
I feel like I'm only just
holding my job down, most days,

480
00:28:18,463 --> 00:28:20,023
and that's...

481
00:28:21,503 --> 00:28:23,942
It's terrifying.

482
00:28:23,943 --> 00:28:26,983
Sorry, you don't need to know that,
either.

483
00:28:36,943 --> 00:28:38,263
Hello?

484
00:28:40,183 --> 00:28:41,782
They've found the car.

485
00:28:41,783 --> 00:28:45,302
In the car park above Southowram Hall
in Cumbry Wood.

486
00:28:45,303 --> 00:28:47,222
But not them?

487
00:28:47,223 --> 00:28:48,302
Hello?

488
00:28:48,303 --> 00:28:51,182
We're turning a good number of
officers out now.

489
00:28:51,183 --> 00:28:53,502
Is there anywhere at all
in the vicinity

490
00:28:53,503 --> 00:28:56,303
where you think they're most likely
to have gone?

491
00:28:57,623 --> 00:29:00,142
Can I help you? I'm the curator.
Your sergeant rang me.

492
00:29:00,143 --> 00:29:02,822
I got here as soon as I could.
Two pensioners?

493
00:29:02,823 --> 00:29:05,222
Are you the key holder, sir?
One of them.

494
00:29:05,223 --> 00:29:08,662
I can open up for you,
you're more than welcome,
but we weren't open yesterday.

495
00:29:08,663 --> 00:29:11,622
We don't open on a Monday.
We've had no visitors since Sunday.

496
00:29:11,623 --> 00:29:15,782
Can I ask, has either of them
been depressed at all lately?

497
00:29:15,783 --> 00:29:17,942
No! Not at all!

498
00:29:17,943 --> 00:29:20,982
Completely the opposite!
They're in love with each other.

499
00:29:20,983 --> 00:29:22,543
They've never been happier!

500
00:29:37,823 --> 00:29:40,262
Right, that's it.
Summat weird's happening.

501
00:29:40,263 --> 00:29:42,942
Why's the car there and them
not in it?

502
00:29:42,943 --> 00:29:46,142
And asking me if either of them
has been depressed lately?

503
00:29:46,143 --> 00:29:50,102
They're just trying to rule things
out, Gillian. It's routine.

504
00:29:50,103 --> 00:29:52,702
They're just trying to
think of the best way forward.

505
00:29:52,703 --> 00:29:56,062
There's nothing sinister about it.
He doesn't know 'em like you do.

506
00:29:56,063 --> 00:29:59,622
He's just trying to build up
a picture. He's just doing his job.

507
00:29:59,623 --> 00:30:02,062
Do you want to drive over there?
I wouldn't.

508
00:30:02,063 --> 00:30:04,542
Honestly,
you're best off here, in t'warm.

509
00:30:04,543 --> 00:30:07,702
You're only going to wind yourselves
up even more if you go over there.

510
00:30:07,703 --> 00:30:10,343
Let them get on with it.
They know what they're doing.

511
00:30:11,343 --> 00:30:15,502
Look, stuff like this happens...
every week.

512
00:30:15,503 --> 00:30:17,502
It's not unusual.

513
00:30:17,503 --> 00:30:20,102
Nine times out of ten,
there's a perfectly...

514
00:30:20,103 --> 00:30:25,222
Well, not necessarily
a rational explanation,
but there's an explanation.

515
00:30:25,223 --> 00:30:29,743
People turn up right as rain.
They're often embarrassed
there's been such a fuss!

516
00:30:30,743 --> 00:30:33,302
I just hope he's warm somewhere.

517
00:30:33,303 --> 00:30:36,663
Not out in this.
Why don't I go over there?

518
00:30:37,703 --> 00:30:40,942
I might find summat out.
And I can keep you up to date better.

519
00:30:40,943 --> 00:30:42,463
Do you want to?

520
00:30:43,503 --> 00:30:44,783
Yeah.

521
00:31:43,223 --> 00:31:46,223
It's very nice,
waking up to this every morning.

522
00:31:47,343 --> 00:31:49,342
Well, yeah.

523
00:31:49,343 --> 00:31:50,943
In summer.

524
00:31:52,263 --> 00:31:53,543
Me dad...

525
00:31:55,263 --> 00:32:00,062
was saying, how would you feel
if Celia came to live with us here?

526
00:32:00,063 --> 00:32:04,062
He was just speculating. I don't
think they've made a decision.

527
00:32:04,063 --> 00:32:08,742
And I said I'd be delighted,
but I don't know how she'd go on
in winter.

528
00:32:08,743 --> 00:32:11,462
Wind can knock you over.

529
00:32:11,463 --> 00:32:14,143
We had eight-foot snowdrifts
last year.

530
00:32:15,583 --> 00:32:19,223
No, I can't quite picture her
milking cows.

531
00:32:21,143 --> 00:32:23,342
I don't have any cows.

532
00:32:23,343 --> 00:32:24,583
Just sheep.

533
00:32:27,703 --> 00:32:30,142
I always wanted a farm.

534
00:32:30,143 --> 00:32:32,943
I don't know why.
I wasn't born into it.

535
00:32:35,223 --> 00:32:37,663
Was your husband? God, no!

536
00:32:39,023 --> 00:32:43,142
Biking and boozing
were his two big career choices.

537
00:32:43,143 --> 00:32:46,703
It was me that did all the wheeling
and dealing and finding out.

538
00:32:48,223 --> 00:32:51,383
He liked it. Well, he loved it.
But...

539
00:32:52,983 --> 00:32:54,222
Where is he?

540
00:32:54,223 --> 00:32:56,102
Dead.

541
00:32:56,103 --> 00:32:58,142
Ten years, this next time.

542
00:32:58,143 --> 00:32:59,903
What happened?

543
00:33:01,223 --> 00:33:03,302
Smashed his skull
with a log splitter.

544
00:33:03,303 --> 00:33:05,303
Oh! In t'barn.

545
00:33:06,583 --> 00:33:07,662
Jesus.

546
00:33:07,663 --> 00:33:09,823
Bled to death.

547
00:33:11,103 --> 00:33:13,542
Which was just as well.

548
00:33:13,543 --> 00:33:16,143
He'd have had brain damage
if he'd survived.

549
00:33:17,863 --> 00:33:21,063
I found him. That was pleasant!

550
00:33:22,183 --> 00:33:23,743
Was it an accident?

551
00:33:25,383 --> 00:33:26,423
No.

552
00:33:29,503 --> 00:33:31,342
Oh, eh.

553
00:33:31,343 --> 00:33:33,183
Sorry.

554
00:33:34,983 --> 00:33:36,823
Do you think they're dead? No.

555
00:33:39,103 --> 00:33:41,943
No, I don't think
we should assume that.

556
00:33:43,223 --> 00:33:46,622
He loves her, you know. So much.

557
00:33:46,623 --> 00:33:49,143
He's... It's beautiful.

558
00:33:50,703 --> 00:33:52,663
It's extraordinary.

559
00:33:57,503 --> 00:34:02,222
Whatever has happened,
he'll be looking after her.

560
00:34:02,223 --> 00:34:03,623
I know that.

561
00:34:04,663 --> 00:34:06,463
I know.

562
00:34:09,903 --> 00:34:11,303
It's bothered me, though.

563
00:34:13,423 --> 00:34:16,022
That thing about me mother...

564
00:34:16,023 --> 00:34:18,382
not passing on that message to him.

565
00:34:18,383 --> 00:34:19,983
From your mum.

566
00:34:23,303 --> 00:34:25,143
Because, you know, I suppose...

567
00:34:26,423 --> 00:34:30,543
you want to be able to think
that she'd have been happy for him.

568
00:34:31,943 --> 00:34:34,223
Meeting up with Celia
after all this time.

569
00:34:35,783 --> 00:34:37,463
He's been so...

570
00:34:39,783 --> 00:34:41,503
happy.

571
00:34:44,663 --> 00:34:47,623
But maybe she wouldn't have been.

572
00:34:49,623 --> 00:34:52,822
She were jealous enough to stop 'em
getting together in t'first place.

573
00:34:52,823 --> 00:34:55,102
Maybe she'd have been really...!

574
00:34:55,103 --> 00:34:57,943
She was a teenager
when she did that.

575
00:34:59,463 --> 00:35:03,062
She was the same age Raff is now -
nobody can hold that against her.

576
00:35:03,063 --> 00:35:04,343
But she deceived him...

577
00:35:05,943 --> 00:35:08,143
all their lives.

578
00:35:09,343 --> 00:35:11,262
And he's only just found out.

579
00:35:11,263 --> 00:35:13,103
And I think it's upset him.

580
00:35:14,983 --> 00:35:17,783
He hasn't said owt. No.

581
00:35:19,023 --> 00:35:23,582
If your dad hadn't married your mum,
and my mum hadn't married my dad,

582
00:35:23,583 --> 00:35:26,782
neither of us would be here, so...
Or we could've been sisters.

583
00:35:26,783 --> 00:35:29,863
Yeah, well that would have
been a... Disaster.

584
00:35:31,423 --> 00:35:35,463
I think we should be very grateful
to your mum on the quiet
for doing what she did.

585
00:35:36,503 --> 00:35:37,982
Yeah.

586
00:35:37,983 --> 00:35:40,463
Your parents were happy,
weren't they? Yeah, yeah!

587
00:35:40,464 --> 00:35:41,782
Well, then!

588
00:35:41,783 --> 00:35:43,783
They always seemed to be.

589
00:35:44,783 --> 00:35:45,903
Weren't yours?

590
00:35:47,023 --> 00:35:48,782
Well...

591
00:35:48,783 --> 00:35:51,102
that's what's so odd.

592
00:35:51,103 --> 00:35:55,383
She's suddenly such a different
person to the one I've known
for the last 45 years.

593
00:35:57,263 --> 00:36:01,423
It's suddenly like she's alive,
like I've never seen her before.

594
00:36:16,823 --> 00:36:20,063
Celia? Celia!

595
00:36:21,823 --> 00:36:23,702
Oh, I've been asleep.

596
00:36:23,703 --> 00:36:24,743
Ssh! Ssh!

597
00:36:27,623 --> 00:36:29,222
What time is it?

598
00:36:29,223 --> 00:36:31,422
Oh, it's twenty to eight!

599
00:36:31,423 --> 00:36:33,462
Oh, it's never!

600
00:36:33,463 --> 00:36:35,342
It is!

601
00:36:35,343 --> 00:36:38,182
Oh! Ooh, I'm stiff!

602
00:36:38,183 --> 00:36:39,502
Yeah.

603
00:36:39,503 --> 00:36:41,302
Come on.

604
00:36:41,303 --> 00:36:44,062
Are you all right? Yeah.

605
00:36:44,063 --> 00:36:45,902
I think so.

606
00:36:45,903 --> 00:36:47,422
Are you?

607
00:36:47,423 --> 00:36:50,183
Oh, I've no idea!

608
00:36:55,623 --> 00:37:00,183
I'm sure I shut that door
before we got back into bed.

609
00:37:02,783 --> 00:37:05,303
Oh, let's get out of here.

610
00:37:09,623 --> 00:37:12,382
I'm not optimistic.
Both in their 70s,

611
00:37:12,383 --> 00:37:13,983
out all night. Hello!

612
00:37:15,103 --> 00:37:17,262
We've been shut in!
Are you in charge?

613
00:37:17,263 --> 00:37:20,782
I, er...
We took some chocolate, we had to.

614
00:37:20,783 --> 00:37:23,062
I've left a £5 note by the till.

615
00:37:23,063 --> 00:37:25,342
Are you all right?
And I made the bed.

616
00:37:25,343 --> 00:37:27,783
You should have rung for help.
We couldn't make it work!

617
00:37:27,784 --> 00:37:30,942
And you can't get a signal on
t'mobile! You've to ring 9
for an outside line.

618
00:37:30,943 --> 00:37:34,222
Well, you should have it written
by the phone on a bit of card,

619
00:37:34,223 --> 00:37:36,422
then folk would know.
We weren't open yesterday.

620
00:37:36,423 --> 00:37:39,382
That door was. We had a delivery...

621
00:37:39,383 --> 00:37:42,502
About half past fourish? Oh, my God!

622
00:37:42,503 --> 00:37:44,502
We waited to buy tickets.

623
00:37:44,503 --> 00:37:47,782
Only nobody came, so we wandered
through there, looking for somebody.

624
00:37:47,783 --> 00:37:50,462
Yeah, and then we heard
the door slam. And that was that.

625
00:37:50,463 --> 00:37:53,263
I'm amazed we didn't
set t'alarm off.

626
00:37:55,543 --> 00:37:57,582
Oh, bloody hell.

627
00:37:57,583 --> 00:38:00,422
You couldn't get us an outside line
right now, could you?

628
00:38:00,423 --> 00:38:03,302
Only there'll be people
wondering where the heck we are!

629
00:38:03,303 --> 00:38:04,583
Yeah. There are.

630
00:38:04,584 --> 00:38:07,183
Half of West Yorkshire Police
are out looking for you!

631
00:38:11,383 --> 00:38:13,662
'What are you going to do
about work?'

632
00:38:13,663 --> 00:38:18,542
I've spoken to the deputy heads.
They can keep things afloat without
me for as long as, um...

633
00:38:18,543 --> 00:38:20,622
I thought we'd know something
by now.

634
00:38:20,623 --> 00:38:23,382
How are the boys?
I'm not sending Lawrence to school.

635
00:38:23,383 --> 00:38:26,982
William's not got any exams today
anyway, but neither of them
slept a wink.

636
00:38:26,983 --> 00:38:29,182
'Well, none of us have.' It's fine.

637
00:38:29,183 --> 00:38:31,622
Fine.

638
00:38:31,623 --> 00:38:33,782
Hello! Granddad!

639
00:38:33,783 --> 00:38:34,982
Oh, my God!

640
00:38:34,983 --> 00:38:36,223
Are you both all right?

641
00:38:36,224 --> 00:38:40,382
Mrs... Dr? Caroline's here.
She's been here all night with...

642
00:38:40,383 --> 00:38:43,063
Can I talk to her?
She wants to talk to Celia.

643
00:38:44,303 --> 00:38:45,462
Mum?

644
00:38:45,463 --> 00:38:48,022
Gillian! Mum!

645
00:38:48,023 --> 00:38:50,862
Gillian! Gillian!

646
00:38:50,863 --> 00:38:54,262
They're fine. They're fine!
They're absolutely fine.

647
00:38:54,263 --> 00:38:56,103
They got shut inside
Southowram Hall.

648
00:38:56,104 --> 00:38:58,622
They've been playing cards
and eating chocolate!

649
00:38:58,623 --> 00:38:59,783
Shut in?! Yeah!

650
00:38:59,784 --> 00:39:02,063
Didn't t'police think
to look in there first?!

651
00:39:06,423 --> 00:39:08,902
Oh, I'll kill him!

652
00:39:08,903 --> 00:39:10,462
Dozy...!

653
00:39:10,463 --> 00:39:15,983
Only he could go getting himself
in a...!

654
00:39:18,183 --> 00:39:20,143
Oh!

655
00:39:37,503 --> 00:39:39,582
OK, so, school.

656
00:39:39,583 --> 00:39:43,182
Mum says you don't have to go,
so I suggest bed, day off,
Xbox, possibly.

657
00:39:43,183 --> 00:39:45,662
Yes!
Go for it. Not you, obviously.

658
00:39:45,663 --> 00:39:47,342
You have to revise.

659
00:39:47,343 --> 00:39:50,343
I, sadly, have to go to
the supermarket.

660
00:40:00,743 --> 00:40:03,942
You'll be better off upstairs,
out of t'way.

661
00:40:03,943 --> 00:40:06,142
Where will you sleep? On t'settee.

662
00:40:06,143 --> 00:40:10,542
I'll hide your car in t'barn, then
if anybody comes looking for you...

663
00:40:10,543 --> 00:40:12,303
No, no, no.

664
00:40:13,783 --> 00:40:15,622
I'll tell 'em you're not here.

665
00:40:15,623 --> 00:40:17,983
OK?

666
00:40:25,303 --> 00:40:26,663
OK.

667
00:40:28,583 --> 00:40:30,062
Right...

668
00:40:30,063 --> 00:40:33,902
you... keep it quiet till I've had
a chance to explain to me dad

669
00:40:33,903 --> 00:40:36,582
what the bloody hell
you're doing here.

670
00:40:36,583 --> 00:40:38,462
Then... Ow!

671
00:40:38,463 --> 00:40:42,422
When I have, I don't want
any vulgar comments

672
00:40:42,423 --> 00:40:44,982
of any description
in front of Celia!

673
00:40:44,983 --> 00:40:47,262
Is that absolutely understood?

674
00:40:47,263 --> 00:40:51,182
Cos you'll be out on your arse
if you do, faster than you can say
"compound fracture".

675
00:40:51,183 --> 00:40:54,302
Now, is there anything I've said
you're having trouble with?

676
00:40:54,303 --> 00:40:57,903
Have you got me painkillers?

677
00:40:59,183 --> 00:41:01,582
I'll get you some water.

678
00:41:01,583 --> 00:41:04,942
I wish I'd have thought
to stick him in here sooner.

679
00:41:04,943 --> 00:41:06,343
Mum, they're here!

680
00:41:14,583 --> 00:41:17,302
What happened?! Oh!

681
00:41:17,303 --> 00:41:19,983
Shouldn't you be at work? Yes.

682
00:41:21,263 --> 00:41:25,502
Hey, whose car is that? We had
a full house last night trying to
work out where the hell you were.

683
00:41:25,503 --> 00:41:27,462
Hey! Is that our Land Rover?!

684
00:41:27,463 --> 00:41:28,743
It was hit by lightning.

685
00:41:28,744 --> 00:41:32,302
Are you all right?
Stiff, cold and muzzy-headed.

686
00:41:32,303 --> 00:41:35,302
I hope the police gave whoever
locked you in a rocket up their...

687
00:41:35,303 --> 00:41:37,062
Oh, that's guaranteed.

688
00:41:37,063 --> 00:41:39,782
We thought you'd eloped!
Eh, that's a good idea.

689
00:41:39,783 --> 00:41:41,982
Are you hungry?

690
00:41:41,983 --> 00:41:44,862
Oh, a nice cup of tea with a bit of
sugar, I think.

691
00:41:44,863 --> 00:41:47,702
Oh, we can do tea!
And he needs his pills!

692
00:41:47,703 --> 00:41:49,543
Hey, whose car did you say that were?

693
00:41:49,544 --> 00:41:52,702
Oh, it's, um... It's Paul Jatri's.

694
00:41:52,703 --> 00:41:54,742
Paul Jatri? Yeah!

695
00:41:54,743 --> 00:41:57,782
Yeah, he's... I'll get t'kettle on.

696
00:41:57,783 --> 00:41:59,063
How do you feel?

697
00:41:59,064 --> 00:42:02,143
Oh, like puke warmed up,
to quote our Lawrence.

698
00:42:08,703 --> 00:42:10,662
Hi. Ah.

699
00:42:10,663 --> 00:42:12,503
Sorry about this.

700
00:42:17,143 --> 00:42:18,223
Two months' rent.

701
00:42:18,224 --> 00:42:21,423
You really are very kind.

702
00:42:22,743 --> 00:42:25,462
John? Are you all right?

703
00:42:25,463 --> 00:42:28,382
Oh, didn't get much sleep last night.

704
00:42:28,383 --> 00:42:32,262
God, I didn't mean for you to get
panicky! I'm not blackmailing you!

705
00:42:32,263 --> 00:42:34,982
My mother-in-law went missing. Oh.

706
00:42:34,983 --> 00:42:36,582
Is she...? Fine. She's fine.

707
00:42:36,583 --> 00:42:38,062
She's absolutely fine.

708
00:42:38,063 --> 00:42:41,382
Oh, well, that's... good.

709
00:42:41,383 --> 00:42:46,462
I was thinking of asking Tim Hoskins
if I could have my old job back

710
00:42:46,463 --> 00:42:47,903
at the university library.

711
00:42:47,904 --> 00:42:50,462
Judith, it was Tim Hoskins
who asked you to leave.

712
00:42:50,463 --> 00:42:56,182
Yes, I know, but I thought,
if you could put a word in for me,

713
00:42:56,183 --> 00:42:58,342
if you told him
that I'm getting better

714
00:42:58,343 --> 00:43:00,102
and I'm dealing with it and...

715
00:43:00,103 --> 00:43:01,783
I imagine he's replaced you by now.

716
00:43:01,784 --> 00:43:04,022
Yes, but next time
there's a vacancy.

717
00:43:04,023 --> 00:43:05,782
Judith, no!

718
00:43:05,783 --> 00:43:09,182
I'm going to tell Caroline I've
given you that money, all right?

719
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:12,942
And please, don't ask me for any
more. I think as regards employment,

720
00:43:12,943 --> 00:43:17,583
you're going to have to set your
sights on something more realistic.
For "realistic", read "menial"?!

721
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:23,742
You WERE going to introduce me
to your publisher! Have you got
anything finished to show him?

722
00:43:23,743 --> 00:43:25,862
I've written another chapter,
that's four!

723
00:43:25,863 --> 00:43:30,343
Judith, I've explained this.
No-one's going to publish
a few chapters. I know that!

724
00:43:31,903 --> 00:43:35,022
And no-one's going to advance you
some money on the strength of them.

725
00:43:35,023 --> 00:43:37,062
Again, we come back
to living in the real world!

726
00:43:37,063 --> 00:43:38,662
Oh, you're a patronising...!

727
00:43:38,663 --> 00:43:40,902
No, Judith, I'm telling it to you
like it is.

728
00:43:40,903 --> 00:43:42,503
It's possibly time someone did.

729
00:43:43,543 --> 00:43:47,262
You used to say I had a potential
as a novelist. Yes, I did!

730
00:43:47,263 --> 00:43:48,783
You still have to put the hours in!

731
00:43:48,784 --> 00:43:52,542
You still have to stay sober
long enough to actually get it down
in black and white!

732
00:43:52,543 --> 00:43:56,502
You can't make a career and a living
out of potential!

733
00:43:56,503 --> 00:43:58,942
You've got to take it
to the next level.

734
00:43:58,943 --> 00:44:03,302
If you ever understand what I'm
saying, and simply got on with it,
you'd probably thank me in the end.

735
00:44:03,303 --> 00:44:04,423
As it is... Piss off!

736
00:44:04,424 --> 00:44:05,983
Exactly.

737
00:44:07,103 --> 00:44:11,622
If... If I ever did think you were
genuinely making an effort, I hope...

738
00:44:11,623 --> 00:44:13,982
I HOPE - I would help you.

739
00:44:13,983 --> 00:44:16,063
As it is, that's it now.

740
00:44:31,143 --> 00:44:32,462
We should sue!

741
00:44:32,463 --> 00:44:35,382
I mean, you lot have been worried
out of your minds.

742
00:44:35,383 --> 00:44:39,142
Me and Alan's traumatised.
It's negligence!

743
00:44:39,143 --> 00:44:42,662
But they've offered you the venue
free of charge for the wedding?

744
00:44:42,663 --> 00:44:46,702
Mm-hm. Well, you can't accept that
and sue them, can you?

745
00:44:46,703 --> 00:44:49,302
Well, no.

746
00:44:49,303 --> 00:44:51,343
And it is very classy.

747
00:44:53,303 --> 00:44:56,862
There can't be so many can afford
to get married there.

748
00:44:56,863 --> 00:44:59,462
And it would be one in the eye
for the church!

749
00:44:59,463 --> 00:45:01,782
We got turned down! Did I tell you?

750
00:45:01,783 --> 00:45:03,982
I mean, can you believe it?!

751
00:45:03,983 --> 00:45:08,742
The hours me and Alan have sat
suffering in that church
when we were kids.

752
00:45:08,743 --> 00:45:11,863
And now we don't even qualify
to get wed in it!

753
00:45:12,903 --> 00:45:14,343
It's criminal!

754
00:45:18,543 --> 00:45:21,742
You've been having a fling
with Paul Jatri?!

755
00:45:21,743 --> 00:45:25,182
Can you believe it?
Oh, he's only 15!

756
00:45:25,183 --> 00:45:28,942
No, Dad, that would be illegal.
He's 22.

757
00:45:28,943 --> 00:45:31,782
Yeah, and you're 45!
Have you looked in t'mirror lately?

758
00:45:31,783 --> 00:45:34,782
It wasn't a fling! It was just...

759
00:45:34,783 --> 00:45:38,142
It's not funny. It's a mess! That's
why clever beggar got arrested!

760
00:45:38,143 --> 00:45:41,222
And then Paul's girlfriend
got wind of it and...

761
00:45:41,223 --> 00:45:42,822
He's got a girlfriend?!

762
00:45:42,823 --> 00:45:44,942
He's engaged to Neil Creswell's lass!

763
00:45:44,943 --> 00:45:48,262
Her brothers have done him over
even worse! A hell of a lot worse!

764
00:45:48,263 --> 00:45:50,062
Then there's my Land...

765
00:45:50,063 --> 00:45:52,142
That's why he's upstairs in my bed

766
00:45:52,143 --> 00:45:55,142
with a broken leg, a bust jaw,
three cracked ribs

767
00:45:55,143 --> 00:45:58,743
and the fingers on one hand
all smashed to... buggery!

768
00:46:00,103 --> 00:46:02,942
Can you believe it?
He's got nowhere else to go!

769
00:46:02,943 --> 00:46:04,462
You always did pick 'em!

770
00:46:04,463 --> 00:46:07,262
I've made it clear to him,
he hasn't...

771
00:46:07,263 --> 00:46:11,542
to do or say anything crude
or provocative in front of Celia,

772
00:46:11,543 --> 00:46:13,542
which I don't think he will.

773
00:46:13,543 --> 00:46:16,542
He's not capable at the minute.
Oh, it's your house.

774
00:46:16,543 --> 00:46:19,182
Don't say that, Granddad!
Tell her to chuck him out!

775
00:46:19,183 --> 00:46:21,143
You're not really stopping
with Robbie?

776
00:46:21,144 --> 00:46:24,622
Well... well, why would I want
to be here?

777
00:46:24,623 --> 00:46:28,822
I don't mind her having a boyfriend,
but why can't she pick somebody
who A - isn't a dickhead,

778
00:46:28,823 --> 00:46:34,182
B - isn't 300 years younger than
she is, and C - wasn't engaged
to somebody else!

779
00:46:34,183 --> 00:46:36,942
So I'm not perfect!
I'm amazed this is news to you!

780
00:46:36,943 --> 00:46:40,143
Have I ever claimed to be?!

781
00:46:44,503 --> 00:46:45,982
Oh!

782
00:46:45,983 --> 00:46:48,942
Fella that's engaged!

783
00:46:48,943 --> 00:46:51,623
Yes! All right! So crucify me!

784
00:46:53,023 --> 00:46:55,343
Are you all right?

785
00:46:56,943 --> 00:47:01,263
I might pop down to t'surgery
in the next few days.

786
00:47:02,663 --> 00:47:05,902
Make a little appointment,
just have a little check-up.

787
00:47:05,903 --> 00:47:08,542
Are you...? No, it's nowt...

788
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:09,902
It's a twinge.

789
00:47:09,903 --> 00:47:12,502
Once or twice last night.
I'll ring up now.

790
00:47:12,503 --> 00:47:16,142
No, no, I'll ring. I'll ring.
I'll... wait, while it's quieter.

791
00:47:16,143 --> 00:47:18,502
Dad. It's nowt.

792
00:47:18,503 --> 00:47:20,182
It's... It's stress.

793
00:47:20,183 --> 00:47:23,942
Last night, it was stressful.

794
00:47:23,943 --> 00:47:26,023
I'm fine. I am.

795
00:47:27,343 --> 00:47:28,702
I've never been happier!

796
00:47:28,703 --> 00:47:32,462
That's better than any medicine.

797
00:47:32,463 --> 00:47:35,102
You didn't have your pills on you
last night, did you?

798
00:47:35,103 --> 00:47:40,742
No... but I've taken them now.
When will you learn? You've got to
take them with you, wherever you go.

799
00:47:40,743 --> 00:47:43,622
Especially now with all of these...
shenanigans

800
00:47:43,623 --> 00:47:46,622
you've started getting into...
Up to. Right, well, I will.

801
00:47:46,623 --> 00:47:48,462
Promise me. I promise.

802
00:47:48,463 --> 00:47:51,302
And bugger popping down in t'next
few days. You're ringing now,

803
00:47:51,303 --> 00:47:53,183
as soon as everyone's gone.
All right.

804
00:47:53,184 --> 00:47:55,182
No. Right, as in...?

805
00:47:55,183 --> 00:47:57,422
Yes, right as in right.

806
00:47:57,423 --> 00:47:58,822
Sorry to interrupt.

807
00:47:58,823 --> 00:48:03,462
I'm going to get off. I ought to try
and get into work this afternoon.

808
00:48:03,463 --> 00:48:07,582
I'll look after 'em.
You take care of yourself.

809
00:48:07,583 --> 00:48:10,543
Yeah, I will. And you.

810
00:48:18,063 --> 00:48:20,022
Don't be depressed.

811
00:48:20,023 --> 00:48:21,382
It's a waste of time.

812
00:48:21,383 --> 00:48:23,543
Just move on.

813
00:48:24,583 --> 00:48:27,303
It's easier said than done, I know.

814
00:48:28,383 --> 00:48:31,663
Good luck with, um...
Yeah, well. We'll see.

815
00:48:38,343 --> 00:48:39,423
Drive safely!

816
00:48:50,623 --> 00:48:53,423
I'll drop him off at school.
Will you be able to stay awake?

817
00:48:58,423 --> 00:49:00,303
Thank you... Robbie.

818
00:50:36,303 --> 00:50:39,862
I'm running you a nice, hot bath.
Oh!

819
00:50:39,863 --> 00:50:41,902
I put you some bubbles in.

820
00:50:41,903 --> 00:50:43,422
Aw. Do you like bubbles?

821
00:50:43,423 --> 00:50:45,702
I love bubbles.
It'll warm you through.

822
00:50:45,703 --> 00:50:47,542
It will.

823
00:50:47,543 --> 00:50:50,542
Well, I say a nice hot bath -
it generally takes half an hour
to fill,

824
00:50:50,543 --> 00:50:52,982
by which time, it's slightly cooler,
but...

825
00:50:52,983 --> 00:50:54,422
It'll be lovely.

826
00:50:54,423 --> 00:50:56,822
And we've got plenty towels.

827
00:50:56,823 --> 00:50:59,382
Good.
I've put you two over t'radiator

828
00:50:59,383 --> 00:51:02,022
and I've set you up a little radio
next to t'bath.

829
00:51:02,023 --> 00:51:03,902
I'll put it on Radio 2.

830
00:51:03,903 --> 00:51:05,862
It is Radio 2 you like?

831
00:51:05,863 --> 00:51:07,503
I love Radio 2!

832
00:51:08,903 --> 00:51:10,662
Can I make you some more tea?

833
00:51:10,663 --> 00:51:13,782
No! I'm all tea-ed out.

834
00:51:13,783 --> 00:51:15,982
I'll make you a nice pot of coffee!

835
00:51:15,983 --> 00:51:19,302
Then you can step out of the bath
and have a cup of hot coffee!

836
00:51:19,303 --> 00:51:22,182
You're spoiling me.

837
00:51:22,183 --> 00:51:24,462
Yeah, well...

838
00:51:24,463 --> 00:51:26,262
that's t'plan.

839
00:51:26,263 --> 00:51:28,582
So you'd better get used to it...

840
00:51:28,583 --> 00:51:30,183
Mrs Buttershaw!

841
00:51:31,263 --> 00:51:35,303
Because that's the way
it's going to be from now on!

842
00:51:42,263 --> 00:51:43,343
Right.

843
00:52:04,063 --> 00:52:05,822
Hi.

844
00:52:05,823 --> 00:52:08,462
Hi. You must be exhausted.

845
00:52:08,463 --> 00:52:10,862
Did you send the boys to school?

846
00:52:10,863 --> 00:52:13,662
No, they're both asleep
in front of the telly. How's Celia?

847
00:52:13,663 --> 00:52:15,142
Fine!

848
00:52:15,143 --> 00:52:17,262
A bit - I don't know - wobbly.

849
00:52:17,263 --> 00:52:18,783
Shock, probably.

850
00:52:20,343 --> 00:52:22,502
She wanted to stay over there, so...

851
00:52:22,503 --> 00:52:24,662
It's a weird thing to happen.

852
00:52:24,663 --> 00:52:26,622
Can I make you some coffee?

853
00:52:26,623 --> 00:52:27,783
Um...

854
00:52:31,663 --> 00:52:33,222
No, thank you.

855
00:52:33,223 --> 00:52:38,382
I'm going to go to sleep for a bit,
then I might... try and go into work.

856
00:52:38,383 --> 00:52:41,342
Oh, surely no-one's going
to expect you in today.

857
00:52:41,343 --> 00:52:43,782
Could I...? What?

858
00:52:43,783 --> 00:52:46,222
I wanted to say something,
tell you something.

859
00:52:46,223 --> 00:52:47,943
What?

860
00:53:03,863 --> 00:53:05,743
I hate what's gone wrong between us.

861
00:53:05,744 --> 00:53:08,182
I don't know if you're ever going
to forgive me,

862
00:53:08,183 --> 00:53:12,542
but I made this deal with myself
that I would never lie to you
ever again.

863
00:53:12,543 --> 00:53:15,542
Or deceive you
in any way, shape or form,

864
00:53:15,543 --> 00:53:20,222
in the hope that one day,
you would possibly...

865
00:53:20,223 --> 00:53:24,502
So, I want you to know that
purely because I felt responsible,

866
00:53:24,503 --> 00:53:27,382
guilty, God knows...

867
00:53:27,383 --> 00:53:29,102
sorry for her,

868
00:53:29,103 --> 00:53:33,702
because she's so... pathetic, I lent...

869
00:53:33,703 --> 00:53:38,102
gave - Judith some money
for her rent.

870
00:53:38,103 --> 00:53:41,862
When?! This morning,
but I've made it clear to her
there's no more where that came from.

871
00:53:41,863 --> 00:53:45,782
And - and - I've told her
that I'd be telling you all about it.

872
00:53:45,783 --> 00:53:49,022
She rang up begging,

873
00:53:49,023 --> 00:53:50,502
begging!

874
00:53:50,503 --> 00:53:55,662
She's got almost no...
grasp on the realities of life.

875
00:53:55,663 --> 00:53:57,662
Aww. Poor bitch.

876
00:53:57,663 --> 00:53:59,343
I wish she didn't exist.

877
00:54:00,863 --> 00:54:04,382
Which is a terrible thing
to say about someone.

878
00:54:04,383 --> 00:54:08,262
I've been thinking. Yeah?

879
00:54:08,263 --> 00:54:13,182
This can work here. We can be civil,
can't we, for the boys?

880
00:54:13,183 --> 00:54:15,542
And like you said,
there's room for everyone.

881
00:54:15,543 --> 00:54:18,462
Sure. So?

882
00:54:18,463 --> 00:54:20,903
I'm seeing someone.

883
00:54:21,943 --> 00:54:24,142
Y-Y-Y... Mmm.

884
00:54:24,143 --> 00:54:25,742
You are? Mmm.

885
00:54:25,743 --> 00:54:27,462
You? Who?

886
00:54:27,463 --> 00:54:29,582
When? It's not...

887
00:54:29,583 --> 00:54:33,383
I don't know if it's
what I want entirely yet, but...

888
00:54:36,623 --> 00:54:38,742
I won't know if I don't try.

889
00:54:38,743 --> 00:54:40,262
Who?

890
00:54:40,263 --> 00:54:41,662
Someone. Who?!

891
00:54:41,663 --> 00:54:43,342
It doesn't matter! Matters to me!

892
00:54:43,343 --> 00:54:46,902
I'm not going to tell you
who it is, John, so...

893
00:54:46,903 --> 00:54:49,142
Someone at work?
Possibly. Possibly not.

894
00:54:49,143 --> 00:54:50,702
It is! You may think that.

895
00:54:50,703 --> 00:54:52,422
I couldn't possibly comment.

896
00:54:52,423 --> 00:54:53,862
Who? I'm going to bed.

897
00:54:53,863 --> 00:54:56,342
Who?! John! Who?!
That's the deal!

898
00:54:56,343 --> 00:54:58,503
Hang on, I'm not living
under the same roof as you

899
00:54:58,504 --> 00:55:00,622
while you're having it off
with someone else!

900
00:55:00,623 --> 00:55:02,822
Well, you know where the door is.

901
00:55:02,823 --> 00:55:04,661
Are you lying, Caroline?
Are you lying?!

902
00:55:04,662 --> 00:55:06,461
I don't do lies!
Well, who is it then?!

903
00:55:06,462 --> 00:55:07,943
No-one! Why's it a secret?!

904
00:55:07,944 --> 00:55:11,422
Because I don't want to have to
listen to any of your opinions

905
00:55:11,423 --> 00:55:14,542
and comments and
inane bloody rubbish.

906
00:55:14,543 --> 00:55:15,821
So it's someone I know!

907
00:55:15,822 --> 00:55:16,983
Maybe, maybe not!

908
00:55:16,984 --> 00:55:19,062
What's going on?! Nothing.

909
00:55:19,063 --> 00:55:20,822
Hi, kids!

910
00:55:20,823 --> 00:55:23,382
What's up?

911
00:55:23,383 --> 00:55:24,582
She's... What?

912
00:55:24,583 --> 00:55:25,663
Seeing someone.

913
00:55:25,664 --> 00:55:27,502
Mum? Yes.

914
00:55:27,503 --> 00:55:29,582
Mum?! Yes!

915
00:55:29,583 --> 00:55:32,143
Who? Some... I don't know!

916
00:55:33,343 --> 00:55:36,383
Does she bother with anyone
in particular at school?

917
00:55:44,143 --> 00:55:47,822
No. Don't be stupid!

918
00:55:47,823 --> 00:55:49,783
Caroline!

919
00:55:52,343 --> 00:55:53,662
Caroline!

920
00:55:53,663 --> 00:55:55,622
Caroline!

921
00:55:55,623 --> 00:55:57,223
Come on! Open the door!
