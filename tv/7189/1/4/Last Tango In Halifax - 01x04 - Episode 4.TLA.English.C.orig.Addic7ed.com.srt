1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,400
Are you all right?
I just have a heart condition.

2
00:00:01,491 --> 00:00:05,569
If you ring me,
I'll run round here even though
I know you're not really interested.

3
00:00:06,249 --> 00:00:07,808
'I'm not NOT interested.'

4
00:00:07,809 --> 00:00:10,329
Raff? 'I assume he's seen the light,
worked out what'

5
00:00:10,353 --> 00:00:14,791
a mad bitch you are. If he wants to
move in here, that's fine by me.

6
00:00:14,792 --> 00:00:17,991
Don't you dare fill his head
with rubbish about me.

7
00:00:17,992 --> 00:00:22,431
This marriage is over and I do not
want to waste another... Silly bitch!

8
00:00:22,562 --> 00:00:25,882
Second of my life pretending
it's something worth saving!

9
00:00:27,162 --> 00:00:30,001
What's he doing here?
He's got nowhere else to go.

10
00:00:30,002 --> 00:00:32,801
What do you want? You couldn't
lend me some money, could you?

11
00:00:32,802 --> 00:00:36,601
Where would you like to get wed? You
can get wed anywhere now, you know.

12
00:00:36,602 --> 00:00:39,481
Hello? Is anybody there?

13
00:00:39,526 --> 00:00:41,086
Oh, no!

14
00:00:43,179 --> 00:01:29,936
<font color="#3399CC">Subtitles by </font><font color="ffffff">MemoryOnSmells</font>
<font color="#3399CC">http://UKsubtitles.ru.</font>

15
00:01:32,526 --> 00:01:35,245
It's all safe now.
Why don't you get back in t'warm?

16
00:01:35,246 --> 00:01:37,846
We'll get off. Bye. Thanks.

17
00:01:54,926 --> 00:01:58,326
'Hello, this is Alan Buttershaw.
Please leave your message
after the tone.'

18
00:01:59,646 --> 00:02:03,126
Dad, it's me... again, just to say...

19
00:02:05,526 --> 00:02:09,885
where are you, basically,
and did you get my last message,

20
00:02:09,886 --> 00:02:12,725
about picking up a takeaway? Cos...

21
00:02:12,726 --> 00:02:16,046
I've not been able to think about
cooking with all this going on.

22
00:02:17,311 --> 00:02:18,390
Bye.

23
00:02:18,391 --> 00:02:21,110
I so didn't need this happening
right now.

24
00:02:21,111 --> 00:02:22,669
You'll have to ring your insurance.

25
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:24,271
They'll give me about 50 quid
for it.

26
00:02:25,631 --> 00:02:27,910
How the hell am I going to buy
another one?

27
00:02:27,911 --> 00:02:29,310
You can use my car.

28
00:02:29,311 --> 00:02:30,351
Thanks.

29
00:02:32,191 --> 00:02:36,550
How'd it start? Oh, they don't know -
lightning... electrical fault...

30
00:02:36,551 --> 00:02:39,071
You don't think someone torched it?

31
00:02:42,511 --> 00:02:43,550
Like who?

32
00:02:43,551 --> 00:02:46,950
Cresswells. Hailey's stupid brothers.

33
00:02:46,951 --> 00:02:48,871
I wish me dad would get home.

34
00:02:49,991 --> 00:02:53,071
They should've been here
over an hour since.

35
00:02:59,271 --> 00:03:00,910
Ooh!

36
00:03:00,911 --> 00:03:03,271
D'you know,
I've had some poor cards.

37
00:03:08,471 --> 00:03:10,951
Oh, there she goes again.

38
00:03:12,951 --> 00:03:14,270
♪ With her 'ead...

39
00:03:14,271 --> 00:03:16,470
♪ ...tucked underneath her arm

40
00:03:16,471 --> 00:03:20,310
♪ She walks the bloody tower! ♪

41
00:03:20,311 --> 00:03:21,831
We're in here, love!

42
00:03:25,191 --> 00:03:26,951
You're right, it'll be a draught.

43
00:03:28,191 --> 00:03:34,230
House this size, this old,
it'd be odd if it didn't creak
and make a few noises.

44
00:03:34,231 --> 00:03:37,830
Shall we make another expedition
to t'water closet after this hand?

45
00:03:37,831 --> 00:03:39,470
Mmm, can do.

46
00:03:39,471 --> 00:03:43,190
I don't know why that telephone
at reception won't work.

47
00:03:43,191 --> 00:03:46,150
It's obviously connected.

48
00:03:46,151 --> 00:03:48,511
I'm amazed we've not set off
an alarm.

49
00:03:55,031 --> 00:03:58,671
D'you think anyone's realised
that we're missing?

50
00:04:10,631 --> 00:04:13,590
She's just here, just now,
let me ask her. Caroline...

51
00:04:13,591 --> 00:04:15,750
What's all this mess? Dad's cooking.

52
00:04:15,751 --> 00:04:18,670
How was your exam? Good... ish.

53
00:04:18,671 --> 00:04:19,751
Answered everything?

54
00:04:19,752 --> 00:04:22,150
Mmm. No nasty surprises?

55
00:04:22,151 --> 00:04:23,830
Caroline, it's Gillian. Who?

56
00:04:23,831 --> 00:04:26,910
Slightly concerned cos she was under
the impression your mum and Alan

57
00:04:26,911 --> 00:04:28,711
were due at hers and they've not
turned up.

58
00:04:28,712 --> 00:04:30,510
So? They're adults.

59
00:04:30,511 --> 00:04:32,550
Yes, but she was expecting them
at five.

60
00:04:32,551 --> 00:04:34,310
She's cooking for them, and...

61
00:04:34,311 --> 00:04:36,031
Do you want to talk to her?

62
00:04:42,551 --> 00:04:43,910
Gillian, hi!

63
00:04:43,911 --> 00:04:46,750
I was just ringing to see
if they were with you, that's all.

64
00:04:46,751 --> 00:04:49,870
Er, no, their car's not here.
They're not here, I just looked.

65
00:04:49,871 --> 00:04:52,430
I got the idea they were
leaving here first thing.

66
00:04:52,431 --> 00:04:53,591
They did, I know. I...

67
00:04:53,592 --> 00:04:56,750
I just wondered if they'd gone back
to Harrogate for whatever reason.

68
00:04:56,751 --> 00:04:58,190
I don't think so.

69
00:04:58,191 --> 00:04:59,671
Has your mum got a mobile?

70
00:04:59,672 --> 00:05:02,230
Yes.
Would you mind ringing her for me?

71
00:05:02,231 --> 00:05:04,790
I don't mind 'em being late
just so long as they're all right.

72
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:07,470
Sure. I'll get back to you,
give me a minute.

73
00:05:07,471 --> 00:05:09,310
Thank you. 'Bye.'

74
00:05:09,311 --> 00:05:10,351
Bye-bye.

75
00:05:13,231 --> 00:05:16,350
Why is she ringing you on your
mobile? Why? Well...

76
00:05:16,351 --> 00:05:19,830
'Hello, this is Celia...' Shush!
'..Dawson. Please leave a message.'

77
00:05:19,831 --> 00:05:21,310
'Thank you.'

78
00:05:21,311 --> 00:05:22,551
Hi, Mum, it's me.

79
00:05:22,552 --> 00:05:25,671
Can you give me a ring when you get
this message, please? Thank you.
Bye.

80
00:05:26,791 --> 00:05:29,631
I, er, need Gillian's number.

81
00:05:32,151 --> 00:05:35,911
07700 900 827.

82
00:05:37,271 --> 00:05:40,990
I rang her to say thank you
for letting me stay at her house
after you drove off without me.

83
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:43,309
I got her number from Alan
when he drove me over here.

84
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:44,511
And you saved it.

85
00:05:44,512 --> 00:05:48,270
Well, yes, not, not, not...
You're transparent.

86
00:05:48,271 --> 00:05:50,030
'Hello?'

87
00:05:50,031 --> 00:05:52,350
Gillian, hi. I'm just getting
voice mail.

88
00:05:52,351 --> 00:05:54,990
'OK.' I'm sure they'll turn up.

89
00:05:54,991 --> 00:05:59,031
I just worry about me dad
having his pills on him, you know...

90
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:01,191
for his heart.

91
00:06:01,192 --> 00:06:03,190
Oh, God, yeah, of course.

92
00:06:03,191 --> 00:06:06,430
'And he wouldn't not ring
if he knew he was going to be late,

93
00:06:06,431 --> 00:06:08,271
'when he knew I was
cooking for 'em.'

94
00:06:08,272 --> 00:06:09,391
He's just...

95
00:06:10,551 --> 00:06:13,390
He's polite, he's thoughtful.

96
00:06:13,391 --> 00:06:16,670
Has he any friends or relatives
they might have visited?

97
00:06:16,671 --> 00:06:19,630
Yeah. Yeah, I just thought
I'd try you first.

98
00:06:19,631 --> 00:06:21,310
I'll keep trying her number.

99
00:06:21,311 --> 00:06:22,550
Thanks.

100
00:06:22,551 --> 00:06:25,550
'Will you ring me?' Course.

101
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:28,390
OK, bye. They've probably just
got carried away

102
00:06:28,391 --> 00:06:30,591
doing something
and forgotten to look at the clock.

103
00:06:30,592 --> 00:06:32,830
Yeah, whatever. I'm cooking.

104
00:06:32,831 --> 00:06:34,511
Not for me. I don't want your filth.

105
00:06:34,512 --> 00:06:37,950
You see, that's just...
I have a timetable.
I know what I'm cooking, when.

106
00:06:37,951 --> 00:06:41,270
That's the way you organise yourself
when you have two strapping
teenagers,

107
00:06:41,271 --> 00:06:43,830
a demanding, time-consuming,
full-time job,

108
00:06:43,831 --> 00:06:46,431
and a husband who dumps you
for an alcoholic.

109
00:06:48,151 --> 00:06:50,311
What's happening with Granny?
Oh, er...

110
00:06:51,871 --> 00:06:55,110
Her and Alan haven't turned up at
Gillian's when they're supposed to,

111
00:06:55,111 --> 00:06:56,550
and... she's, er...

112
00:06:56,551 --> 00:06:57,951
worried about where they are.

113
00:07:00,231 --> 00:07:01,431
I'll get changed.

114
00:07:10,271 --> 00:07:12,590
Ee, it's got a grand flush,
that toilet.

115
00:07:12,591 --> 00:07:15,910
They built things properly,
didn't they, the Victorians?

116
00:07:15,911 --> 00:07:18,670
Well, strictly speaking,
it's Georgian.

117
00:07:18,671 --> 00:07:21,390
1836, North Tower were completed...

118
00:07:21,391 --> 00:07:24,790
year before Victoria
ascended t'throne.

119
00:07:24,791 --> 00:07:28,030
Oh, very good.
"Main body of the house..."

120
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:32,350
Here, I didn't know it were
this old - dates back to 1514!

121
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:33,950
Oh, fancy!

122
00:07:33,951 --> 00:07:37,310
Yeah, it's a good job
we didn't try smashing a window.

123
00:07:37,311 --> 00:07:43,710
Stained glass is original medieval -
it's unique, it's priceless.

124
00:07:43,711 --> 00:07:44,751
Heck!

125
00:07:46,031 --> 00:07:49,630
There she blows.
I wish she wouldn't.

126
00:07:49,631 --> 00:07:51,431
We're in t'cludgie, missus!

127
00:07:59,031 --> 00:08:00,910
There's somebody up there.

128
00:08:00,911 --> 00:08:01,951
Hello!

129
00:08:03,511 --> 00:08:06,150
Oh, shit!
No, no, no, we're all right.

130
00:08:06,151 --> 00:08:07,991
What are we going to do?

131
00:08:09,151 --> 00:08:10,231
Hello!

132
00:08:13,511 --> 00:08:15,911
We're going to go back up to
t'bedroom...

133
00:08:17,591 --> 00:08:20,511
and shut t'door... and play cards.

134
00:08:21,511 --> 00:08:23,790
Hello!

135
00:08:23,791 --> 00:08:27,711
We got shut in! We're not burglars!
We're pensioners!

136
00:08:28,951 --> 00:08:29,991
Hello!

137
00:08:33,911 --> 00:08:35,631
What was that?

138
00:08:37,711 --> 00:08:38,750
Nothing.

139
00:08:38,751 --> 00:08:40,271
It's nothing.

140
00:08:43,151 --> 00:08:46,391
Are you all right? Gillian?

141
00:08:48,311 --> 00:08:51,431
I just want to know that he's
all right, that's all.

142
00:08:58,151 --> 00:09:00,030
Who were that? Her.

143
00:09:00,031 --> 00:09:01,751
Your mother. Who else?

144
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:04,190
Mad bitch!

145
00:09:04,191 --> 00:09:05,950
Paul Jatri.

146
00:09:05,951 --> 00:09:08,030
I know! Paul bloody Jatri!

147
00:09:08,031 --> 00:09:09,590
I know! Why?

148
00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:10,990
God knows.

149
00:09:10,991 --> 00:09:13,430
No, really... you know, why?

150
00:09:13,431 --> 00:09:15,350
You're asking t'wrong person.

151
00:09:15,351 --> 00:09:18,990
Apart from t'fact that he's engaged
to Neil Cresswell's lass,

152
00:09:18,991 --> 00:09:21,790
he's got a mental age of
a blancmange. He's retarded.

153
00:09:21,791 --> 00:09:24,590
Well, probably not his brain
she's bothering with him for, is it?

154
00:09:24,591 --> 00:09:28,191
Bloody screw loose, I tell you,
she always has had. Yeah, all right!

155
00:09:29,831 --> 00:09:31,751
All right.

156
00:09:33,711 --> 00:09:35,030
Sorry.

157
00:09:35,031 --> 00:09:36,271
Sorry.

158
00:09:37,431 --> 00:09:40,030
Right, I'm going to drive over
to Halifax.

159
00:09:40,031 --> 00:09:41,150
Really?

160
00:09:41,151 --> 00:09:44,950
Yeah. Why don't I give it
till nine o'clock?

161
00:09:44,951 --> 00:09:48,350
Yep, I'll give it till nine and if
we still haven't heard anything,
I'll...

162
00:09:48,351 --> 00:09:52,871
Do you want me to come with you,
Mum? No, no, you've got school
tomorrow.

163
00:09:59,911 --> 00:10:01,790
Hello!

164
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:03,590
Robbie, it's Gillian.

165
00:10:03,591 --> 00:10:05,190
Yeah, I thought it might be.

166
00:10:05,191 --> 00:10:08,470
Me dad hasn't turned up...
when he was supposed to,

167
00:10:08,471 --> 00:10:12,670
couple of hours ago now,
and I wanted to know
if Raff had seen him

168
00:10:12,671 --> 00:10:15,470
or had a phone call from him
or anything.

169
00:10:15,471 --> 00:10:17,830
'Is he there?'
Is that the best you can do?

170
00:10:17,831 --> 00:10:20,110
I'm sorry? 'Excuses for ringing up.'

171
00:10:20,111 --> 00:10:23,391
I'm not mucking about, Robbie.
He's got his heart problem.

172
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:28,431
I just want to know if Raff's heard
from him. It's that simple.

173
00:10:30,471 --> 00:10:32,431
Raff? Mmm?

174
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:36,231
Come on, summat about your granddad.

175
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:42,870
What d'you want?

176
00:10:42,871 --> 00:10:45,071
Have you heard from Granddad
at all this evening?

177
00:10:45,072 --> 00:10:47,430
'No.' He's not rung you, or...?

178
00:10:47,431 --> 00:10:48,550
Why?

179
00:10:48,551 --> 00:10:51,750
'Because I was expecting him
at five for tea...

180
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:53,630
'him and Celia -'

181
00:10:53,631 --> 00:10:55,111
and they've not turned up.

182
00:10:55,112 --> 00:10:58,150
Where were they last time you spoke?
In a cafe in Elland,

183
00:10:58,151 --> 00:11:00,470
'two o'clock.'
Have you tried ringing him since?

184
00:11:00,471 --> 00:11:02,031
Course I've...!

185
00:11:03,831 --> 00:11:05,830
I'm ringing him every ten minutes.

186
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:08,430
'So... Well, what are you
going to do?'

187
00:11:08,431 --> 00:11:11,391
I'll have to ring round
the hospitals, won't I?

188
00:11:12,391 --> 00:11:14,030
Well, do you want me to do owt?

189
00:11:14,031 --> 00:11:15,870
No.

190
00:11:15,871 --> 00:11:17,391
Do you want me to go looking
for him?

191
00:11:18,391 --> 00:11:19,671
No.

192
00:11:21,031 --> 00:11:22,911
Do you want me to come over?

193
00:11:24,111 --> 00:11:25,471
If you want.

194
00:11:26,631 --> 00:11:28,511
Is that twat still lying
on our settee?

195
00:11:28,512 --> 00:11:34,150
If you want to come over and
help me think about what to do next,

196
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:35,511
'you'd be very welcome.'

197
00:11:37,511 --> 00:11:38,991
Have you done your homework?

198
00:11:47,751 --> 00:11:49,830
We should sue. You what?

199
00:11:49,831 --> 00:11:53,830
In the morning, when we get out
of this godforsaken hole,
we should sue.

200
00:11:53,831 --> 00:11:57,910
This is entrapment.
Well, negligence.

201
00:11:57,911 --> 00:11:59,871
I mean, what if someone...?

202
00:12:01,431 --> 00:12:04,990
Have you got your pills?
I'll be reet.

203
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:06,631
Come on, get in.

204
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:10,870
Happen they weren't footsteps.

205
00:12:10,871 --> 00:12:13,750
Happen... just sounds a house makes.

206
00:12:13,751 --> 00:12:16,110
A house this old, this big,

207
00:12:16,111 --> 00:12:17,670
can sound like... Yeah.

208
00:12:17,671 --> 00:12:19,991
Anything, anything you want it
to sound like.

209
00:12:21,391 --> 00:12:24,910
I don't believe in ghosts.
Neither do I.

210
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:28,470
I think once you've cashed your
chips - pfft! - that's it.

211
00:12:28,471 --> 00:12:30,431
Yeah...

212
00:12:31,431 --> 00:12:32,871
although...

213
00:12:34,471 --> 00:12:35,510
What?

214
00:12:35,511 --> 00:12:39,190
I've always thought there's more
between heaven and earth

215
00:12:39,191 --> 00:12:42,110
than any of us ever know about.

216
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:43,711
Oh, well...

217
00:12:44,871 --> 00:12:46,031
Aye.

218
00:12:49,831 --> 00:12:54,231
Was that... candle on
that table... before?

219
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:04,390
Have they turned up?

220
00:13:04,391 --> 00:13:07,510
No, they haven't. You don't have to
knock, you know, you can just
come in.

221
00:13:07,511 --> 00:13:08,791
Come in!

222
00:13:12,351 --> 00:13:15,270
What happened to t'Land Rover?
Blew up.

223
00:13:15,271 --> 00:13:17,830
How?
Lightning, electrical fault...

224
00:13:17,831 --> 00:13:20,710
or someone torched it. Torched it?!

225
00:13:20,711 --> 00:13:23,071
When? Just after you left.

226
00:13:24,831 --> 00:13:26,470
It were probably lightning.

227
00:13:26,471 --> 00:13:28,831
Well, how are you going to
manage...? I'll manage.

228
00:13:30,031 --> 00:13:33,870
Robbie thought we should come over,
help look for me granddad.

229
00:13:33,871 --> 00:13:36,830
Did he? Right, well...

230
00:13:36,831 --> 00:13:37,950
thanks.

231
00:13:37,951 --> 00:13:40,470
Have you reported it to t'police? No.

232
00:13:40,471 --> 00:13:42,990
Is that them?

233
00:13:42,991 --> 00:13:44,151
Is it?

234
00:13:45,511 --> 00:13:46,871
Doesn't look like.

235
00:13:48,991 --> 00:13:52,310
It's Harry and Maurice.
Your granddad's buddies.

236
00:13:52,311 --> 00:13:56,030
Do you think it's that serious?
Do you think I should report it
to the police?

237
00:13:56,031 --> 00:13:59,110
It's up to you.
I'm asking your advice.

238
00:13:59,111 --> 00:14:02,630
Well, you can report it
any time you like.

239
00:14:02,631 --> 00:14:05,870
There's a legitimate cause for
concern cos of his heart condition.

240
00:14:05,871 --> 00:14:07,710
Oh, God.

241
00:14:07,711 --> 00:14:08,911
D'you wanna...?

242
00:14:15,751 --> 00:14:17,630
You all right, love?

243
00:14:17,631 --> 00:14:20,830
I rang Silly Bugger but he's not
heard owt from 'em either.

244
00:14:20,831 --> 00:14:24,230
Good evening, Gillian.
I'm sure there's a perfectly simple
explanation.

245
00:14:24,231 --> 00:14:26,191
You'd hope so, wouldn't you?

246
00:14:27,191 --> 00:14:28,751
Cavalry's arrived.

247
00:14:30,271 --> 00:14:32,390
Tell you what. What?

248
00:14:32,391 --> 00:14:33,590
It's raining.

249
00:14:33,591 --> 00:14:35,991
You all right, Raff, lad?
Not so bad.

250
00:14:37,191 --> 00:14:39,710
My God! What's happened to him?

251
00:14:39,711 --> 00:14:41,070
Eh?

252
00:14:41,071 --> 00:14:43,070
You all right, love? Er...

253
00:14:43,071 --> 00:14:46,110
So, what's the latest, Gillian?

254
00:14:46,111 --> 00:14:49,110
I've run round the hospitals,
but of course that doesn't mean

255
00:14:49,111 --> 00:14:52,390
they haven't gone off the side of
the road somewhere up in t'wilds,
but...

256
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:53,671
Nay, they'll be right.

257
00:14:53,672 --> 00:14:57,270
How do you know he hasn't taken her
to some hotel somewhere

258
00:14:57,271 --> 00:15:00,430
for a wild night of
nudge-nudge wink-wink?

259
00:15:00,431 --> 00:15:03,070
It's all he thinks about.

260
00:15:03,071 --> 00:15:04,350
Is it 'ell.

261
00:15:04,351 --> 00:15:07,710
I don't know, that, Harry,
I just... I think he'd have rung me.

262
00:15:07,711 --> 00:15:10,070
So, at what stage do we report it
to the police?

263
00:15:10,071 --> 00:15:12,670
Well, Robbie's...
I've told her any time.

264
00:15:12,671 --> 00:15:14,270
Given his, er...

265
00:15:14,271 --> 00:15:17,150
I thought I'd leave it while 11,
and then...

266
00:15:17,151 --> 00:15:18,510
Nay. Get 'em rung.

267
00:15:18,511 --> 00:15:22,070
Well, I don't want to... overreact.

268
00:15:22,071 --> 00:15:25,870
You don't want to think the worst.
That's the thing.

269
00:15:25,871 --> 00:15:28,671
But... given his...

270
00:15:30,351 --> 00:15:33,991
They'll be grateful, t'police -
probably got bugger all else to do.

271
00:15:36,391 --> 00:15:39,150
Don't look at me like that.
I tell it like it is.

272
00:15:39,151 --> 00:15:44,030
Well, I would, but he has,
on occasion, been out supping
with you lot all hours

273
00:15:44,031 --> 00:15:47,030
before now,
then turned up talking gibberish

274
00:15:47,031 --> 00:15:49,990
with his trouser legs rolled up
and his coat on inside out.

275
00:15:49,991 --> 00:15:54,110
Yes, well, that was... unfortunate.

276
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:57,191
It were his birthday!
What's up with you?

277
00:15:59,831 --> 00:16:04,350
Missing? No, just not turned up
when they were supposed to.

278
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:06,350
So, well, where do you think
they are?

279
00:16:06,351 --> 00:16:10,270
I've got no idea!
Nobody does, that's...

280
00:16:10,271 --> 00:16:12,470
I'm sorry, Kate. I'm just...

281
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:14,510
Wound up? Course you are.
That's all right.

282
00:16:14,511 --> 00:16:16,270
I'm sure she's absolutely...

283
00:16:16,271 --> 00:16:17,790
Course. Of course.

284
00:16:17,791 --> 00:16:22,110
She doesn't go out after dark,
as a rule, though, that's the thing.

285
00:16:22,111 --> 00:16:23,871
Her eyes aren't what they were,
and...

286
00:16:24,911 --> 00:16:26,710
There'll be an explanation.

287
00:16:26,711 --> 00:16:29,430
Listen, ring me
if there's anything I can do.

288
00:16:29,431 --> 00:16:32,350
Or if you just want to talk
to someone.

289
00:16:32,351 --> 00:16:34,470
What were you ringing me for?

290
00:16:34,471 --> 00:16:36,830
Oh!

291
00:16:36,831 --> 00:16:39,071
It doesn't seem so important now.

292
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:43,271
Just... you said we should go away.

293
00:16:44,311 --> 00:16:45,591
'For the weekend.

294
00:16:45,592 --> 00:16:48,190
'Together, somewhere, possibly.

295
00:16:48,191 --> 00:16:51,950
'And I wanted to know if you
meant it, and if you did, '

296
00:16:51,951 --> 00:16:54,351
if I should fix something up.

297
00:16:57,591 --> 00:16:59,790
Can we talk about it later?

298
00:16:59,791 --> 00:17:00,991
Yeah, of course.

299
00:17:26,551 --> 00:17:30,790
Hi. Is there any news? Me mum's
through there with Robbie talking
to a uniform.

300
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:33,430
Are you Celia's lass?

301
00:17:33,431 --> 00:17:34,470
Yes, that's...

302
00:17:34,471 --> 00:17:36,590
Harry Wallace.

303
00:17:36,591 --> 00:17:37,950
This is Maurice Price.

304
00:17:37,951 --> 00:17:40,710
They're me granddad's pals. Ah.

305
00:17:40,711 --> 00:17:43,710
I hope your mother's not been
leading him astray. Been...?

306
00:17:43,711 --> 00:17:46,430
Shut up. Lass is worried.

307
00:17:46,431 --> 00:17:48,351
She knows I'm joking.

308
00:17:49,351 --> 00:17:52,350
I understand you're a doctor!

309
00:17:52,351 --> 00:17:54,310
I'm... Yeah.

310
00:17:54,311 --> 00:17:55,350
Is she?

311
00:17:55,351 --> 00:17:57,030
Will you look at my foot?

312
00:17:57,031 --> 00:18:00,670
Put your foot away.
I've got poor circulation.

313
00:18:00,671 --> 00:18:02,990
I'm not a medical doctor.

314
00:18:02,991 --> 00:18:05,350
What then, then? Chemistry.

315
00:18:05,351 --> 00:18:07,510
Chemistry, can they do that?

316
00:18:07,511 --> 00:18:09,390
Ignore him.

317
00:18:09,391 --> 00:18:10,550
He's rural.

318
00:18:10,551 --> 00:18:14,310
I've a hernia as well. I think it's
a hernia. Do you want to have a look?

319
00:18:14,311 --> 00:18:15,991
It's not really my...

320
00:18:17,111 --> 00:18:20,550
Do we know what's happening?
There's been no developments.

321
00:18:20,551 --> 00:18:24,111
Why don't you sit down, love?

322
00:18:27,311 --> 00:18:29,870
Chemistry.

323
00:18:29,871 --> 00:18:32,830
Margaret Thatcher read chemistry
at Oxford.

324
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:34,870
Yes, well, I was in
a different college.

325
00:18:34,871 --> 00:18:36,871
Yeah, and I'd be apologising an' all.

326
00:18:40,111 --> 00:18:42,590
What's happened? Nothing. Nothing.

327
00:18:42,591 --> 00:18:47,110
It were just, like I said
on t'phone, we decided
there was nothing to lose,

328
00:18:47,111 --> 00:18:51,511
reporting 'em missing
sooner rather than later, so...

329
00:18:52,711 --> 00:18:55,711
Are you all right?
Yeah. Yeah. Are you?

330
00:18:56,791 --> 00:18:58,550
Yeah.

331
00:18:58,551 --> 00:19:01,950
They've taken a description,
and they can...

332
00:19:01,951 --> 00:19:05,230
What are they going to do, Robbie?
Check when the bank cards
were last used,

333
00:19:05,231 --> 00:19:07,950
when their mobiles were last used.
And then we'll run

334
00:19:07,951 --> 00:19:10,390
an ANPR check on their vehicle.
What's that?

335
00:19:10,391 --> 00:19:13,390
Double Dutch. It's like vehicle
plate recognition.

336
00:19:13,391 --> 00:19:17,030
We can see where they were last
picked up on cameras.
See where they were heading.

337
00:19:17,031 --> 00:19:21,350
So when will we know anything?
As soon as we get authority from
upstairs to pursue it.

338
00:19:21,351 --> 00:19:25,470
The lad that we spoke to is going
straight up to see t'Super, so...

339
00:19:25,471 --> 00:19:26,671
Best thing we can...

340
00:19:26,672 --> 00:19:28,669
They said best thing we can do
is go home.

341
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:30,551
They'll ring us when they know owt.

342
00:19:30,552 --> 00:19:32,790
Why don't you go home, lads?

343
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:36,431
I'll ring you if I need you.
If there's any news.

344
00:19:47,551 --> 00:19:51,111
'Hello, this is Celia Dawson.
Please leave...'

345
00:19:56,471 --> 00:19:58,070
Who IS that?

346
00:19:58,071 --> 00:20:00,670
Paul... Jatri.

347
00:20:00,671 --> 00:20:02,910
He's an idiot.

348
00:20:02,911 --> 00:20:05,510
Paul Jat...?
Is that the bloke you...?

349
00:20:05,511 --> 00:20:08,150
Yeah. But I didn't do that to him.

350
00:20:08,151 --> 00:20:10,310
I just bruised him.

351
00:20:10,311 --> 00:20:12,111
That was somebody else.

352
00:20:13,271 --> 00:20:14,670
Right.

353
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:15,911
He's not popular.

354
00:20:17,471 --> 00:20:20,030
So what's... What's he doing here?

355
00:20:20,031 --> 00:20:22,470
That's a good question.

356
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:24,311
Don't ask.

357
00:20:33,551 --> 00:20:35,391
What were you doing
with that dipstick?

358
00:20:35,392 --> 00:20:37,070
Don't start on me, I've enough on.

359
00:20:37,071 --> 00:20:38,430
I just...

360
00:20:38,431 --> 00:20:39,751
What I do is...

361
00:20:40,951 --> 00:20:42,231
You think I'm going to be a nun?

362
00:20:42,232 --> 00:20:44,910
No! No.
Eddie's been dead for ten years.

363
00:20:44,911 --> 00:20:48,270
D'you seriously think I haven't
slept with other people since then?

364
00:20:48,271 --> 00:20:51,150
I just... What's it to you?

365
00:20:51,151 --> 00:20:52,991
I'm sorry.

366
00:20:54,631 --> 00:20:57,109
About all the unpleasantness
there's been between us.

367
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:58,271
Unpleasantness?

368
00:20:58,272 --> 00:21:01,870
Trying to convince people
that I've got a screw loose?

369
00:21:01,871 --> 00:21:05,790
That I murdered my own husband?
Trying to make Raffy believe that?
I was lashing out.

370
00:21:05,791 --> 00:21:07,711
For ten years? I'm sorry.

371
00:21:09,151 --> 00:21:10,191
I just think...

372
00:21:11,391 --> 00:21:12,671
you let yourself down.

373
00:21:12,672 --> 00:21:16,591
Bothering with a streak
of... whatever, like him.

374
00:21:17,791 --> 00:21:19,270
You're better than that.

375
00:21:19,271 --> 00:21:20,351
I thought...

376
00:21:22,871 --> 00:21:28,510
after Eddie died,
you of all people

377
00:21:28,511 --> 00:21:30,991
would help me, support me.

378
00:21:32,271 --> 00:21:34,271
Shit, I was wrong, wasn't it?

379
00:21:35,311 --> 00:21:38,150
D'you think I'm going to forget
what you tried to do to me?

380
00:21:38,151 --> 00:21:40,110
What you put me through?

381
00:21:40,111 --> 00:21:42,390
We could make an all-right team.

382
00:21:42,391 --> 00:21:46,871
You, me, an' Raff, couldn't we?

383
00:21:49,231 --> 00:21:50,790
Did you torch my Land Rover?

384
00:21:50,791 --> 00:21:52,310
No!

385
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:54,271
If the Cresswells did, I will...

386
00:21:56,151 --> 00:21:57,511
I'll get 'em.

387
00:22:00,071 --> 00:22:01,951
That's...

388
00:22:03,551 --> 00:22:04,831
Um...

389
00:22:07,551 --> 00:22:10,351
I'm appreciating the apology,
Robbie.

390
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:20,711
It's fine.

391
00:22:23,671 --> 00:22:25,350
Go to bed.

392
00:22:25,351 --> 00:22:28,230
I'll let you know the second we hear
owt.

393
00:22:28,231 --> 00:22:29,991
There's nowt any of us can do.

394
00:22:31,391 --> 00:22:34,711
Go shut your eyes at least,
you've got school tomorrow.

395
00:22:38,151 --> 00:22:39,590
Hello?

396
00:22:39,591 --> 00:22:40,751
Yes, it is.

397
00:22:41,831 --> 00:22:43,111
Oh, yeah.

398
00:22:44,111 --> 00:22:45,591
4.32, right.

399
00:22:47,071 --> 00:22:48,191
Towards Bradford?!

400
00:22:49,471 --> 00:22:51,350
Godley Lane?

401
00:22:51,351 --> 00:22:53,630
He doesn't know anybody
over that way.

402
00:22:53,631 --> 00:22:54,871
Hang on a minute.

403
00:22:54,872 --> 00:22:58,430
They were caught on camera,
or their registration number was.

404
00:22:58,431 --> 00:23:03,151
Driving up Godley Lane, the other
side of Halifax, towards Bradford.

405
00:23:04,151 --> 00:23:06,271
No further sightings. Right.
So you're...?

406
00:23:07,911 --> 00:23:11,870
They're concentrating on that area
round there initially.

407
00:23:11,871 --> 00:23:13,271
What is there around there?

408
00:23:13,272 --> 00:23:16,190
There's nothing, there's Southowram
Hall, that's about it.

409
00:23:16,191 --> 00:23:18,990
You can get married
at Southowram Hall. What's he said?

410
00:23:18,991 --> 00:23:21,510
He said you can get married
at Southowram Hall.

411
00:23:21,511 --> 00:23:23,511
They were looking for
a wedding venue.

412
00:24:07,671 --> 00:24:10,390
Are you and Mum still getting
divorced then now, or what?

413
00:24:10,391 --> 00:24:11,950
Oh, well...

414
00:24:11,951 --> 00:24:14,230
I'm afraid I don't know.

415
00:24:14,231 --> 00:24:15,511
Can't you win her round?

416
00:24:15,512 --> 00:24:18,790
Can't you... buy her some flowers
or something?

417
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:21,030
Well, I had. Almost.

418
00:24:21,031 --> 00:24:23,230
Won her round. I think. And then...

419
00:24:23,231 --> 00:24:26,070
Don't you blame me. I wasn't!

420
00:24:26,071 --> 00:24:27,430
I wasn't.

421
00:24:27,431 --> 00:24:29,430
Although you did
get the wrong end of the stick.

422
00:24:29,431 --> 00:24:33,030
Yeah, well, if you hadn't
started seeing that... bitch
in the first place,

423
00:24:33,031 --> 00:24:36,790
there wouldn't be any wrong end
of any sticks for anybody
to get hold of, would there?

424
00:24:36,791 --> 00:24:41,270
Yeah, fine. Are we really going to
argue about this now? The point is,
you're not seeing Judith any more,

425
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:43,191
so you don't need to get divorced
any more.

426
00:24:43,192 --> 00:24:47,110
No, the point is,
she can't trust him any more,
any further than she can throw him.

427
00:24:47,111 --> 00:24:51,150
So it's not just as naive and dumb
as saying, "Can't you buy her
some flowers?!"

428
00:24:51,151 --> 00:24:52,511
Piss off! Yeah, well, grow up!

429
00:24:52,512 --> 00:24:55,071
You grow up! Just calm down. Stop it!
Stop it.

430
00:24:56,111 --> 00:25:00,031
We're all worried about Gran,
and this isn't a good way to...

431
00:25:04,191 --> 00:25:05,991
I'm sure me and Mum can
sort things out.

432
00:25:05,992 --> 00:25:09,591
These things take time, sometimes,
that's all.

433
00:25:13,951 --> 00:25:15,631
And a bit of goodwill.

434
00:25:17,551 --> 00:25:20,951
I'm sorry I inflicted my husband
on you the other day.

435
00:25:22,111 --> 00:25:25,590
Oh, well, don't apologise.

436
00:25:25,591 --> 00:25:28,550
I'm sorry my son got arrested
in front of you all...

437
00:25:28,551 --> 00:25:31,270
by his own...

438
00:25:31,271 --> 00:25:32,550
uncle.

439
00:25:32,551 --> 00:25:37,070
So he... Raff beat up the bloke
that's lying on your couch.

440
00:25:37,071 --> 00:25:39,590
Yeah. Yeah, he...

441
00:25:39,591 --> 00:25:41,511
He's Paul. He's...

442
00:25:42,671 --> 00:25:44,310
We're friends, me and Paul,

443
00:25:44,311 --> 00:25:47,150
and Raff got it into his head
that we were more than friends

444
00:25:47,151 --> 00:25:49,431
and he didn't like that. So he...

445
00:25:50,671 --> 00:25:53,751
Then someone else beat him up
even more? Yeah.

446
00:25:55,151 --> 00:25:58,270
His girlfriend's brothers got wind
of what'd been said,

447
00:25:58,271 --> 00:26:01,471
and, well,
they're a pretty unpleasant lot.

448
00:26:02,711 --> 00:26:07,431
Oh... He's got broken limbs
because of some misunderstanding?

449
00:26:11,311 --> 00:26:15,150
So, has everything settled down?

450
00:26:15,151 --> 00:26:18,870
Then? Now? Er, at your end?

451
00:26:18,871 --> 00:26:20,270
Or...?

452
00:26:20,271 --> 00:26:21,951
Oh! Er...

453
00:26:24,071 --> 00:26:26,030
Me and John.

454
00:26:26,031 --> 00:26:27,071
Yeah.

455
00:26:28,191 --> 00:26:29,631
It's beyond that.

456
00:26:32,871 --> 00:26:34,151
What did he tell you?

457
00:26:35,791 --> 00:26:37,271
Oh, that, er...

458
00:26:38,871 --> 00:26:40,590
he'd had a fling,

459
00:26:40,591 --> 00:26:42,630
and...

460
00:26:42,631 --> 00:26:44,950
Yeah, that he wished he hadn't.

461
00:26:44,951 --> 00:26:47,951
Really?
Mmm. And that he wanted just to...

462
00:26:49,831 --> 00:26:51,470
get back with you.

463
00:26:51,471 --> 00:26:55,710
Well, he'd do it again tomorrow
if he met someone else he wanted
to do it with.

464
00:26:55,711 --> 00:26:57,831
That's how sorry he is.

465
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:01,871
Are you all right?

466
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:04,271
Tired.

467
00:27:05,631 --> 00:27:07,630
Where the hell are they?!

468
00:27:07,631 --> 00:27:08,990
Sorry.

469
00:27:08,991 --> 00:27:11,310
I'm sorry. That helps no-one.

470
00:27:11,311 --> 00:27:16,111
No, you're all right. You're
worried. Have a drop of brandy.
Yes, actually.

471
00:27:38,671 --> 00:27:41,551
It wasn't, er, a misunderstanding.

472
00:27:43,711 --> 00:27:45,111
I...

473
00:27:47,311 --> 00:27:50,391
I don't know. I don't even know
why I'm telling you.

474
00:27:55,311 --> 00:27:58,790
Except that Raff doesn't generally
behave like that.

475
00:27:58,791 --> 00:28:02,270
He's... He's not a thug.
He's a grand lad.

476
00:28:02,271 --> 00:28:04,111
Better than I deserve.

477
00:28:05,871 --> 00:28:07,231
He's like my dad.

478
00:28:08,471 --> 00:28:09,631
He's got a big streak

479
00:28:09,632 --> 00:28:12,551
of something very decent
etched right through him.

480
00:28:14,591 --> 00:28:15,991
And I haven't.

481
00:28:17,431 --> 00:28:18,631
I'm a mess.

482
00:28:20,111 --> 00:28:21,510
Well, you know that.

483
00:28:21,511 --> 00:28:24,270
Put your finger on it
the first time you met me.

484
00:28:24,271 --> 00:28:28,951
I shouldn't have said that. It was
stupid. I didn't mean it, it was...

485
00:28:30,591 --> 00:28:31,991
I've been...

486
00:28:36,831 --> 00:28:38,791
I've been depressed.

487
00:28:40,191 --> 00:28:41,790
For months.

488
00:28:41,791 --> 00:28:43,510
Bottling things up and then...

489
00:28:43,511 --> 00:28:47,550
it comes out, and you say things -
silly, nasty, stupid things,

490
00:28:47,551 --> 00:28:50,031
things you don't even mean,
and it's since...

491
00:28:53,151 --> 00:28:54,631
It's since...

492
00:28:58,591 --> 00:29:01,790
I feel like I'm only just
holding my job down, most days,

493
00:29:01,791 --> 00:29:03,351
and that's...

494
00:29:04,831 --> 00:29:07,270
It's terrifying.

495
00:29:07,271 --> 00:29:10,311
Sorry, you don't need to know that,
either.

496
00:29:20,271 --> 00:29:21,591
Hello?

497
00:29:23,511 --> 00:29:25,110
They've found the car.

498
00:29:25,111 --> 00:29:28,630
In the car park above Southowram Hall
in Cumbry Wood.

499
00:29:28,631 --> 00:29:30,550
But not them?

500
00:29:30,551 --> 00:29:31,630
Hello?

501
00:29:31,631 --> 00:29:34,510
We're turning a good number of
officers out now.

502
00:29:34,511 --> 00:29:36,830
Is there anywhere at all
in the vicinity

503
00:29:36,831 --> 00:29:39,631
where you think they're most likely
to have gone?

504
00:29:40,951 --> 00:29:43,470
Can I help you? I'm the curator.
Your sergeant rang me.

505
00:29:43,471 --> 00:29:46,150
I got here as soon as I could.
Two pensioners?

506
00:29:46,151 --> 00:29:48,550
Are you the key holder, sir?
One of them.

507
00:29:48,551 --> 00:29:51,990
I can open up for you,
you're more than welcome,
but we weren't open yesterday.

508
00:29:51,991 --> 00:29:54,950
We don't open on a Monday.
We've had no visitors since Sunday.

509
00:29:54,951 --> 00:29:59,110
Can I ask, has either of them
been depressed at all lately?

510
00:29:59,111 --> 00:30:01,270
No! Not at all!

511
00:30:01,271 --> 00:30:04,310
Completely the opposite!
They're in love with each other.

512
00:30:04,311 --> 00:30:05,871
They've never been happier!

513
00:30:21,151 --> 00:30:23,590
Right, that's it.
Summat weird's happening.

514
00:30:23,591 --> 00:30:26,270
Why's the car there and them
not in it?

515
00:30:26,271 --> 00:30:29,470
And asking me if either of them
has been depressed lately?

516
00:30:29,471 --> 00:30:33,430
They're just trying to rule things
out, Gillian. It's routine.

517
00:30:33,431 --> 00:30:36,030
They're just trying to
think of the best way forward.

518
00:30:36,031 --> 00:30:39,390
There's nothing sinister about it.
He doesn't know 'em like you do.

519
00:30:39,391 --> 00:30:42,950
He's just trying to build up
a picture. He's just doing his job.

520
00:30:42,951 --> 00:30:45,390
Do you want to drive over there?
I wouldn't.

521
00:30:45,391 --> 00:30:47,870
Honestly,
you're best off here, in t'warm.

522
00:30:47,871 --> 00:30:51,030
You're only going to wind yourselves
up even more if you go over there.

523
00:30:51,031 --> 00:30:53,671
Let them get on with it.
They know what they're doing.

524
00:30:54,671 --> 00:30:58,830
Look, stuff like this happens...
every week.

525
00:30:58,831 --> 00:31:00,830
It's not unusual.

526
00:31:00,831 --> 00:31:03,430
Nine times out of ten,
there's a perfectly...

527
00:31:03,431 --> 00:31:08,550
Well, not necessarily
a rational explanation,
but there's an explanation.

528
00:31:08,551 --> 00:31:13,071
People turn up right as rain.
They're often embarrassed
there's been such a fuss!

529
00:31:14,071 --> 00:31:16,630
I just hope he's warm somewhere.

530
00:31:16,631 --> 00:31:19,991
Not out in this.
Why don't I go over there?

531
00:31:21,031 --> 00:31:24,270
I might find summat out.
And I can keep you up to date better.

532
00:31:24,271 --> 00:31:25,791
Do you want to?

533
00:31:26,831 --> 00:31:28,111
Yeah.

534
00:32:26,551 --> 00:32:29,551
It's very nice,
waking up to this every morning.

535
00:32:30,671 --> 00:32:32,670
Well, yeah.

536
00:32:32,671 --> 00:32:34,271
In summer.

537
00:32:35,591 --> 00:32:36,871
Me dad...

538
00:32:38,591 --> 00:32:43,390
was saying, how would you feel
if Celia came to live with us here?

539
00:32:43,391 --> 00:32:47,390
He was just speculating. I don't
think they've made a decision.

540
00:32:47,391 --> 00:32:52,070
And I said I'd be delighted,
but I don't know how she'd go on
in winter.

541
00:32:52,071 --> 00:32:54,790
Wind can knock you over.

542
00:32:54,791 --> 00:32:57,471
We had eight-foot snowdrifts
last year.

543
00:32:58,911 --> 00:33:02,551
No, I can't quite picture her
milking cows.

544
00:33:04,471 --> 00:33:06,670
I don't have any cows.

545
00:33:06,671 --> 00:33:07,911
Just sheep.

546
00:33:11,031 --> 00:33:13,470
I always wanted a farm.

547
00:33:13,471 --> 00:33:16,271
I don't know why.
I wasn't born into it.

548
00:33:18,551 --> 00:33:20,991
Was your husband? God, no!

549
00:33:22,351 --> 00:33:26,470
Biking and boozing
were his two big career choices.

550
00:33:26,471 --> 00:33:30,031
It was me that did all the wheeling
and dealing and finding out.

551
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:34,711
He liked it. Well, he loved it.
But...

552
00:33:36,311 --> 00:33:37,550
Where is he?

553
00:33:37,551 --> 00:33:39,430
Dead.

554
00:33:39,431 --> 00:33:41,470
Ten years, this next time.

555
00:33:41,471 --> 00:33:43,231
What happened?

556
00:33:44,551 --> 00:33:46,630
Smashed his skull
with a log splitter.

557
00:33:46,631 --> 00:33:48,631
Oh! In t'barn.

558
00:33:49,911 --> 00:33:50,990
Jesus.

559
00:33:50,991 --> 00:33:53,151
Bled to death.

560
00:33:54,431 --> 00:33:56,870
Which was just as well.

561
00:33:56,871 --> 00:33:59,471
He'd have had brain damage
if he'd survived.

562
00:34:01,191 --> 00:34:04,391
I found him. That was pleasant!

563
00:34:05,511 --> 00:34:07,071
Was it an accident?

564
00:34:08,711 --> 00:34:09,751
No.

565
00:34:12,831 --> 00:34:14,670
Oh, eh.

566
00:34:14,671 --> 00:34:16,511
Sorry.

567
00:34:18,311 --> 00:34:20,151
Do you think they're dead? No.

568
00:34:22,431 --> 00:34:25,271
No, I don't think
we should assume that.

569
00:34:26,551 --> 00:34:29,950
He loves her, you know. So much.

570
00:34:29,951 --> 00:34:32,471
He's... It's beautiful.

571
00:34:34,031 --> 00:34:35,991
It's extraordinary.

572
00:34:40,831 --> 00:34:45,550
Whatever has happened,
he'll be looking after her.

573
00:34:45,551 --> 00:34:46,951
I know that.

574
00:34:47,991 --> 00:34:49,791
I know.

575
00:34:53,231 --> 00:34:54,631
It's bothered me, though.

576
00:34:56,751 --> 00:34:59,350
That thing about me mother...

577
00:34:59,351 --> 00:35:01,710
not passing on that message to him.

578
00:35:01,711 --> 00:35:03,311
From your mum.

579
00:35:06,631 --> 00:35:08,471
Because, you know, I suppose...

580
00:35:09,751 --> 00:35:13,871
you want to be able to think
that she'd have been happy for him.

581
00:35:15,271 --> 00:35:17,551
Meeting up with Celia
after all this time.

582
00:35:19,111 --> 00:35:20,791
He's been so...

583
00:35:23,111 --> 00:35:24,831
happy.

584
00:35:27,991 --> 00:35:30,951
But maybe she wouldn't have been.

585
00:35:32,951 --> 00:35:36,150
She were jealous enough to stop 'em
getting together in t'first place.

586
00:35:36,151 --> 00:35:38,430
Maybe she'd have been really...!

587
00:35:38,431 --> 00:35:41,271
She was a teenager
when she did that.

588
00:35:42,791 --> 00:35:46,390
She was the same age Raff is now -
nobody can hold that against her.

589
00:35:46,391 --> 00:35:47,671
But she deceived him...

590
00:35:49,271 --> 00:35:51,471
all their lives.

591
00:35:52,671 --> 00:35:54,590
And he's only just found out.

592
00:35:54,591 --> 00:35:56,431
And I think it's upset him.

593
00:35:58,311 --> 00:36:01,111
He hasn't said owt. No.

594
00:36:02,351 --> 00:36:06,910
If your dad hadn't married your mum,
and my mum hadn't married my dad,

595
00:36:06,911 --> 00:36:10,110
neither of us would be here, so...
Or we could've been sisters.

596
00:36:10,111 --> 00:36:13,191
Yeah, well that would have
been a... Disaster.

597
00:36:14,751 --> 00:36:18,791
I think we should be very grateful
to your mum on the quiet
for doing what she did.

598
00:36:19,831 --> 00:36:21,310
Yeah.

599
00:36:21,311 --> 00:36:23,791
Your parents were happy,
weren't they? Yeah, yeah!

600
00:36:23,792 --> 00:36:25,110
Well, then!

601
00:36:25,111 --> 00:36:27,111
They always seemed to be.

602
00:36:28,111 --> 00:36:29,231
Weren't yours?

603
00:36:30,351 --> 00:36:32,110
Well...

604
00:36:32,111 --> 00:36:34,430
that's what's so odd.

605
00:36:34,431 --> 00:36:38,711
She's suddenly such a different
person to the one I've known
for the last 45 years.

606
00:36:40,591 --> 00:36:44,751
It's suddenly like she's alive,
like I've never seen her before.

607
00:37:00,151 --> 00:37:03,391
Celia? Celia!

608
00:37:05,151 --> 00:37:07,030
Oh, I've been asleep.

609
00:37:07,031 --> 00:37:08,071
Ssh! Ssh!

610
00:37:10,951 --> 00:37:12,550
What time is it?

611
00:37:12,551 --> 00:37:14,750
Oh, it's twenty to eight!

612
00:37:14,751 --> 00:37:16,790
Oh, it's never!

613
00:37:16,791 --> 00:37:18,670
It is!

614
00:37:18,671 --> 00:37:21,510
Oh! Ooh, I'm stiff!

615
00:37:21,511 --> 00:37:22,830
Yeah.

616
00:37:22,831 --> 00:37:24,630
Come on.

617
00:37:24,631 --> 00:37:27,390
Are you all right? Yeah.

618
00:37:27,391 --> 00:37:29,230
I think so.

619
00:37:29,231 --> 00:37:30,750
Are you?

620
00:37:30,751 --> 00:37:33,511
Oh, I've no idea!

621
00:37:38,951 --> 00:37:43,511
I'm sure I shut that door
before we got back into bed.

622
00:37:46,111 --> 00:37:48,631
Oh, let's get out of here.

623
00:37:52,951 --> 00:37:55,710
I'm not optimistic.
Both in their 70s,

624
00:37:55,711 --> 00:37:57,311
out all night. Hello!

625
00:37:58,431 --> 00:38:00,590
We've been shut in!
Are you in charge?

626
00:38:00,591 --> 00:38:04,110
I, er...
We took some chocolate, we had to.

627
00:38:04,111 --> 00:38:06,390
I've left a £5 note by the till.

628
00:38:06,391 --> 00:38:08,670
Are you all right?
And I made the bed.

629
00:38:08,671 --> 00:38:11,111
You should have rung for help.
We couldn't make it work!

630
00:38:11,112 --> 00:38:14,270
And you can't get a signal on
t'mobile! You've to ring 9
for an outside line.

631
00:38:14,271 --> 00:38:17,550
Well, you should have it written
by the phone on a bit of card,

632
00:38:17,551 --> 00:38:19,750
then folk would know.
We weren't open yesterday.

633
00:38:19,751 --> 00:38:22,710
That door was. We had a delivery...

634
00:38:22,711 --> 00:38:25,830
About half past fourish? Oh, my God!

635
00:38:25,831 --> 00:38:27,830
We waited to buy tickets.

636
00:38:27,831 --> 00:38:31,110
Only nobody came, so we wandered
through there, looking for somebody.

637
00:38:31,111 --> 00:38:33,790
Yeah, and then we heard
the door slam. And that was that.

638
00:38:33,791 --> 00:38:36,591
I'm amazed we didn't
set t'alarm off.

639
00:38:38,871 --> 00:38:40,910
Oh, bloody hell.

640
00:38:40,911 --> 00:38:43,750
You couldn't get us an outside line
right now, could you?

641
00:38:43,751 --> 00:38:46,630
Only there'll be people
wondering where the heck we are!

642
00:38:46,631 --> 00:38:47,911
Yeah. There are.

643
00:38:47,912 --> 00:38:50,511
Half of West Yorkshire Police
are out looking for you!

644
00:38:54,711 --> 00:38:56,990
'What are you going to do
about work?'

645
00:38:56,991 --> 00:39:01,870
I've spoken to the deputy heads.
They can keep things afloat without
me for as long as, um...

646
00:39:01,871 --> 00:39:03,950
I thought we'd know something
by now.

647
00:39:03,951 --> 00:39:06,710
How are the boys?
I'm not sending Lawrence to school.

648
00:39:06,711 --> 00:39:10,310
William's not got any exams today
anyway, but neither of them
slept a wink.

649
00:39:10,311 --> 00:39:12,510
'Well, none of us have.' It's fine.

650
00:39:12,511 --> 00:39:14,950
Fine.

651
00:39:14,951 --> 00:39:17,110
Hello! Granddad!

652
00:39:17,111 --> 00:39:18,310
Oh, my God!

653
00:39:18,311 --> 00:39:19,551
Are you both all right?

654
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:23,710
Mrs... Dr? Caroline's here.
She's been here all night with...

655
00:39:23,711 --> 00:39:26,391
Can I talk to her?
She wants to talk to Celia.

656
00:39:27,631 --> 00:39:28,790
Mum?

657
00:39:28,791 --> 00:39:31,350
Gillian! Mum!

658
00:39:31,351 --> 00:39:34,190
Gillian! Gillian!

659
00:39:34,191 --> 00:39:37,590
They're fine. They're fine!
They're absolutely fine.

660
00:39:37,591 --> 00:39:39,431
They got shut inside
Southowram Hall.

661
00:39:39,432 --> 00:39:41,950
They've been playing cards
and eating chocolate!

662
00:39:41,951 --> 00:39:43,111
Shut in?! Yeah!

663
00:39:43,112 --> 00:39:45,391
Didn't t'police think
to look in there first?!

664
00:39:49,751 --> 00:39:52,230
Oh, I'll kill him!

665
00:39:52,231 --> 00:39:53,790
Dozy...!

666
00:39:53,791 --> 00:39:59,311
Only he could go getting himself
in a...!

667
00:40:01,511 --> 00:40:03,471
Oh!

668
00:40:20,831 --> 00:40:22,910
OK, so, school.

669
00:40:22,911 --> 00:40:26,510
Mum says you don't have to go,
so I suggest bed, day off,
Xbox, possibly.

670
00:40:26,511 --> 00:40:28,990
Yes!
Go for it. Not you, obviously.

671
00:40:28,991 --> 00:40:30,670
You have to revise.

672
00:40:30,671 --> 00:40:33,671
I, sadly, have to go to
the supermarket.

673
00:40:44,071 --> 00:40:47,270
You'll be better off upstairs,
out of t'way.

674
00:40:47,271 --> 00:40:49,470
Where will you sleep? On t'settee.

675
00:40:49,471 --> 00:40:53,870
I'll hide your car in t'barn, then
if anybody comes looking for you...

676
00:40:53,871 --> 00:40:55,631
No, no, no.

677
00:40:57,111 --> 00:40:58,950
I'll tell 'em you're not here.

678
00:40:58,951 --> 00:41:01,311
OK?

679
00:41:08,631 --> 00:41:09,991
OK.

680
00:41:11,911 --> 00:41:13,390
Right...

681
00:41:13,391 --> 00:41:17,230
you... keep it quiet till I've had
a chance to explain to me dad

682
00:41:17,231 --> 00:41:19,910
what the bloody hell
you're doing here.

683
00:41:19,911 --> 00:41:21,790
Then... Ow!

684
00:41:21,791 --> 00:41:25,750
When I have, I don't want
any vulgar comments

685
00:41:25,751 --> 00:41:28,310
of any description
in front of Celia!

686
00:41:28,311 --> 00:41:30,590
Is that absolutely understood?

687
00:41:30,591 --> 00:41:34,510
Cos you'll be out on your arse
if you do, faster than you can say
"compound fracture".

688
00:41:34,511 --> 00:41:37,630
Now, is there anything I've said
you're having trouble with?

689
00:41:37,631 --> 00:41:41,231
Have you got me painkillers?

690
00:41:42,511 --> 00:41:44,910
I'll get you some water.

691
00:41:44,911 --> 00:41:48,270
I wish I'd have thought
to stick him in here sooner.

692
00:41:48,271 --> 00:41:49,671
Mum, they're here!

693
00:41:57,911 --> 00:42:00,630
What happened?! Oh!

694
00:42:00,631 --> 00:42:03,311
Shouldn't you be at work? Yes.

695
00:42:04,591 --> 00:42:08,830
Hey, whose car is that? We had
a full house last night trying to
work out where the hell you were.

696
00:42:08,831 --> 00:42:10,790
Hey! Is that our Land Rover?!

697
00:42:10,791 --> 00:42:12,071
It was hit by lightning.

698
00:42:12,072 --> 00:42:15,630
Are you all right?
Stiff, cold and muzzy-headed.

699
00:42:15,631 --> 00:42:18,630
I hope the police gave whoever
locked you in a rocket up their...

700
00:42:18,631 --> 00:42:20,390
Oh, that's guaranteed.

701
00:42:20,391 --> 00:42:23,110
We thought you'd eloped!
Eh, that's a good idea.

702
00:42:23,111 --> 00:42:25,310
Are you hungry?

703
00:42:25,311 --> 00:42:28,190
Oh, a nice cup of tea with a bit of
sugar, I think.

704
00:42:28,191 --> 00:42:31,030
Oh, we can do tea!
And he needs his pills!

705
00:42:31,031 --> 00:42:32,871
Hey, whose car did you say that were?

706
00:42:32,872 --> 00:42:36,030
Oh, it's, um... It's Paul Jatri's.

707
00:42:36,031 --> 00:42:38,070
Paul Jatri? Yeah!

708
00:42:38,071 --> 00:42:41,110
Yeah, he's... I'll get t'kettle on.

709
00:42:41,111 --> 00:42:42,391
How do you feel?

710
00:42:42,392 --> 00:42:45,471
Oh, like puke warmed up,
to quote our Lawrence.

711
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:53,990
Hi. Ah.

712
00:42:53,991 --> 00:42:55,831
Sorry about this.

713
00:43:00,471 --> 00:43:01,551
Two months' rent.

714
00:43:01,552 --> 00:43:04,751
You really are very kind.

715
00:43:06,071 --> 00:43:08,790
John? Are you all right?

716
00:43:08,791 --> 00:43:11,710
Oh, didn't get much sleep last night.

717
00:43:11,711 --> 00:43:15,590
God, I didn't mean for you to get
panicky! I'm not blackmailing you!

718
00:43:15,591 --> 00:43:18,310
My mother-in-law went missing. Oh.

719
00:43:18,311 --> 00:43:19,910
Is she...? Fine. She's fine.

720
00:43:19,911 --> 00:43:21,390
She's absolutely fine.

721
00:43:21,391 --> 00:43:24,710
Oh, well, that's... good.

722
00:43:24,711 --> 00:43:29,790
I was thinking of asking Tim Hoskins
if I could have my old job back

723
00:43:29,791 --> 00:43:31,231
at the university library.

724
00:43:31,232 --> 00:43:33,790
Judith, it was Tim Hoskins
who asked you to leave.

725
00:43:33,791 --> 00:43:39,510
Yes, I know, but I thought,
if you could put a word in for me,

726
00:43:39,511 --> 00:43:41,670
if you told him
that I'm getting better

727
00:43:41,671 --> 00:43:43,430
and I'm dealing with it and...

728
00:43:43,431 --> 00:43:45,111
I imagine he's replaced you by now.

729
00:43:45,112 --> 00:43:47,350
Yes, but next time
there's a vacancy.

730
00:43:47,351 --> 00:43:49,110
Judith, no!

731
00:43:49,111 --> 00:43:52,510
I'm going to tell Caroline I've
given you that money, all right?

732
00:43:52,511 --> 00:43:56,270
And please, don't ask me for any
more. I think as regards employment,

733
00:43:56,271 --> 00:44:00,911
you're going to have to set your
sights on something more realistic.
For "realistic", read "menial"?!

734
00:44:02,751 --> 00:44:07,070
You WERE going to introduce me
to your publisher! Have you got
anything finished to show him?

735
00:44:07,071 --> 00:44:09,190
I've written another chapter,
that's four!

736
00:44:09,191 --> 00:44:13,671
Judith, I've explained this.
No-one's going to publish
a few chapters. I know that!

737
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:18,350
And no-one's going to advance you
some money on the strength of them.

738
00:44:18,351 --> 00:44:20,390
Again, we come back
to living in the real world!

739
00:44:20,391 --> 00:44:21,990
Oh, you're a patronising...!

740
00:44:21,991 --> 00:44:24,230
No, Judith, I'm telling it to you
like it is.

741
00:44:24,231 --> 00:44:25,831
It's possibly time someone did.

742
00:44:26,871 --> 00:44:30,590
You used to say I had a potential
as a novelist. Yes, I did!

743
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:32,111
You still have to put the hours in!

744
00:44:32,112 --> 00:44:35,870
You still have to stay sober
long enough to actually get it down
in black and white!

745
00:44:35,871 --> 00:44:39,830
You can't make a career and a living
out of potential!

746
00:44:39,831 --> 00:44:42,270
You've got to take it
to the next level.

747
00:44:42,271 --> 00:44:46,630
If you ever understand what I'm
saying, and simply got on with it,
you'd probably thank me in the end.

748
00:44:46,631 --> 00:44:47,751
As it is... Piss off!

749
00:44:47,752 --> 00:44:49,311
Exactly.

750
00:44:50,431 --> 00:44:54,950
If... If I ever did think you were
genuinely making an effort, I hope...

751
00:44:54,951 --> 00:44:57,310
I HOPE - I would help you.

752
00:44:57,311 --> 00:44:59,391
As it is, that's it now.

753
00:45:14,471 --> 00:45:15,790
We should sue!

754
00:45:15,791 --> 00:45:18,710
I mean, you lot have been worried
out of your minds.

755
00:45:18,711 --> 00:45:22,470
Me and Alan's traumatised.
It's negligence!

756
00:45:22,471 --> 00:45:25,990
But they've offered you the venue
free of charge for the wedding?

757
00:45:25,991 --> 00:45:30,030
Mm-hm. Well, you can't accept that
and sue them, can you?

758
00:45:30,031 --> 00:45:32,630
Well, no.

759
00:45:32,631 --> 00:45:34,671
And it is very classy.

760
00:45:36,631 --> 00:45:40,190
There can't be so many can afford
to get married there.

761
00:45:40,191 --> 00:45:42,790
And it would be one in the eye
for the church!

762
00:45:42,791 --> 00:45:45,110
We got turned down! Did I tell you?

763
00:45:45,111 --> 00:45:47,310
I mean, can you believe it?!

764
00:45:47,311 --> 00:45:52,070
The hours me and Alan have sat
suffering in that church
when we were kids.

765
00:45:52,071 --> 00:45:55,191
And now we don't even qualify
to get wed in it!

766
00:45:56,231 --> 00:45:57,671
It's criminal!

767
00:46:01,871 --> 00:46:05,070
You've been having a fling
with Paul Jatri?!

768
00:46:05,071 --> 00:46:08,510
Can you believe it?
Oh, he's only 15!

769
00:46:08,511 --> 00:46:12,270
No, Dad, that would be illegal.
He's 22.

770
00:46:12,271 --> 00:46:15,110
Yeah, and you're 45!
Have you looked in t'mirror lately?

771
00:46:15,111 --> 00:46:18,110
It wasn't a fling! It was just...

772
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:21,470
It's not funny. It's a mess! That's
why clever beggar got arrested!

773
00:46:21,471 --> 00:46:24,550
And then Paul's girlfriend
got wind of it and...

774
00:46:24,551 --> 00:46:26,150
He's got a girlfriend?!

775
00:46:26,151 --> 00:46:28,270
He's engaged to Neil Creswell's lass!

776
00:46:28,271 --> 00:46:31,590
Her brothers have done him over
even worse! A hell of a lot worse!

777
00:46:31,591 --> 00:46:33,390
Then there's my Land...

778
00:46:33,391 --> 00:46:35,470
That's why he's upstairs in my bed

779
00:46:35,471 --> 00:46:38,470
with a broken leg, a bust jaw,
three cracked ribs

780
00:46:38,471 --> 00:46:42,071
and the fingers on one hand
all smashed to... buggery!

781
00:46:43,431 --> 00:46:46,270
Can you believe it?
He's got nowhere else to go!

782
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:47,790
You always did pick 'em!

783
00:46:47,791 --> 00:46:50,590
I've made it clear to him,
he hasn't...

784
00:46:50,591 --> 00:46:54,870
to do or say anything crude
or provocative in front of Celia,

785
00:46:54,871 --> 00:46:56,870
which I don't think he will.

786
00:46:56,871 --> 00:46:59,870
He's not capable at the minute.
Oh, it's your house.

787
00:46:59,871 --> 00:47:02,510
Don't say that, Granddad!
Tell her to chuck him out!

788
00:47:02,511 --> 00:47:04,471
You're not really stopping
with Robbie?

789
00:47:04,472 --> 00:47:07,950
Well... well, why would I want
to be here?

790
00:47:07,951 --> 00:47:12,150
I don't mind her having a boyfriend,
but why can't she pick somebody
who A - isn't a dickhead,

791
00:47:12,151 --> 00:47:17,510
B - isn't 300 years younger than
she is, and C - wasn't engaged
to somebody else!

792
00:47:17,511 --> 00:47:20,270
So I'm not perfect!
I'm amazed this is news to you!

793
00:47:20,271 --> 00:47:23,471
Have I ever claimed to be?!

794
00:47:27,831 --> 00:47:29,310
Oh!

795
00:47:29,311 --> 00:47:32,270
Fella that's engaged!

796
00:47:32,271 --> 00:47:34,951
Yes! All right! So crucify me!

797
00:47:36,351 --> 00:47:38,671
Are you all right?

798
00:47:40,271 --> 00:47:44,591
I might pop down to t'surgery
in the next few days.

799
00:47:45,991 --> 00:47:49,230
Make a little appointment,
just have a little check-up.

800
00:47:49,231 --> 00:47:51,870
Are you...? No, it's nowt...

801
00:47:51,871 --> 00:47:53,230
It's a twinge.

802
00:47:53,231 --> 00:47:55,830
Once or twice last night.
I'll ring up now.

803
00:47:55,831 --> 00:47:59,470
No, no, I'll ring. I'll ring.
I'll... wait, while it's quieter.

804
00:47:59,471 --> 00:48:01,830
Dad. It's nowt.

805
00:48:01,831 --> 00:48:03,510
It's... It's stress.

806
00:48:03,511 --> 00:48:07,270
Last night, it was stressful.

807
00:48:07,271 --> 00:48:09,351
I'm fine. I am.

808
00:48:10,671 --> 00:48:12,030
I've never been happier!

809
00:48:12,031 --> 00:48:15,790
That's better than any medicine.

810
00:48:15,791 --> 00:48:18,430
You didn't have your pills on you
last night, did you?

811
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:24,070
No... but I've taken them now.
When will you learn? You've got to
take them with you, wherever you go.

812
00:48:24,071 --> 00:48:26,950
Especially now with all of these...
shenanigans

813
00:48:26,951 --> 00:48:29,950
you've started getting into...
Up to. Right, well, I will.

814
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:31,790
Promise me. I promise.

815
00:48:31,791 --> 00:48:34,630
And bugger popping down in t'next
few days. You're ringing now,

816
00:48:34,631 --> 00:48:36,511
as soon as everyone's gone.
All right.

817
00:48:36,512 --> 00:48:38,510
No. Right, as in...?

818
00:48:38,511 --> 00:48:40,750
Yes, right as in right.

819
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:42,150
Sorry to interrupt.

820
00:48:42,151 --> 00:48:46,790
I'm going to get off. I ought to try
and get into work this afternoon.

821
00:48:46,791 --> 00:48:50,910
I'll look after 'em.
You take care of yourself.

822
00:48:50,911 --> 00:48:53,871
Yeah, I will. And you.

823
00:49:01,391 --> 00:49:03,350
Don't be depressed.

824
00:49:03,351 --> 00:49:04,710
It's a waste of time.

825
00:49:04,711 --> 00:49:06,871
Just move on.

826
00:49:07,911 --> 00:49:10,631
It's easier said than done, I know.

827
00:49:11,711 --> 00:49:14,991
Good luck with, um...
Yeah, well. We'll see.

828
00:49:21,671 --> 00:49:22,751
Drive safely!

829
00:49:33,951 --> 00:49:36,751
I'll drop him off at school.
Will you be able to stay awake?

830
00:49:41,751 --> 00:49:43,631
Thank you... Robbie.

831
00:51:19,631 --> 00:51:23,190
I'm running you a nice, hot bath.
Oh!

832
00:51:23,191 --> 00:51:25,230
I put you some bubbles in.

833
00:51:25,231 --> 00:51:26,750
Aw. Do you like bubbles?

834
00:51:26,751 --> 00:51:29,030
I love bubbles.
It'll warm you through.

835
00:51:29,031 --> 00:51:30,870
It will.

836
00:51:30,871 --> 00:51:33,870
Well, I say a nice hot bath -
it generally takes half an hour
to fill,

837
00:51:33,871 --> 00:51:36,310
by which time, it's slightly cooler,
but...

838
00:51:36,311 --> 00:51:37,750
It'll be lovely.

839
00:51:37,751 --> 00:51:40,150
And we've got plenty towels.

840
00:51:40,151 --> 00:51:42,710
Good.
I've put you two over t'radiator

841
00:51:42,711 --> 00:51:45,350
and I've set you up a little radio
next to t'bath.

842
00:51:45,351 --> 00:51:47,230
I'll put it on Radio 2.

843
00:51:47,231 --> 00:51:49,190
It is Radio 2 you like?

844
00:51:49,191 --> 00:51:50,831
I love Radio 2!

845
00:51:52,231 --> 00:51:53,990
Can I make you some more tea?

846
00:51:53,991 --> 00:51:57,110
No! I'm all tea-ed out.

847
00:51:57,111 --> 00:51:59,310
I'll make you a nice pot of coffee!

848
00:51:59,311 --> 00:52:02,630
Then you can step out of the bath
and have a cup of hot coffee!

849
00:52:02,631 --> 00:52:05,510
You're spoiling me.

850
00:52:05,511 --> 00:52:07,790
Yeah, well...

851
00:52:07,791 --> 00:52:09,590
that's t'plan.

852
00:52:09,591 --> 00:52:11,910
So you'd better get used to it...

853
00:52:11,911 --> 00:52:13,511
Mrs Buttershaw!

854
00:52:14,591 --> 00:52:18,631
Because that's the way
it's going to be from now on!

855
00:52:25,591 --> 00:52:26,671
Right.

856
00:52:47,391 --> 00:52:49,150
Hi.

857
00:52:49,151 --> 00:52:51,790
Hi. You must be exhausted.

858
00:52:51,791 --> 00:52:54,190
Did you send the boys to school?

859
00:52:54,191 --> 00:52:56,990
No, they're both asleep
in front of the telly. How's Celia?

860
00:52:56,991 --> 00:52:58,470
Fine!

861
00:52:58,471 --> 00:53:00,590
A bit - I don't know - wobbly.

862
00:53:00,591 --> 00:53:02,111
Shock, probably.

863
00:53:03,671 --> 00:53:05,830
She wanted to stay over there, so...

864
00:53:05,831 --> 00:53:07,990
It's a weird thing to happen.

865
00:53:07,991 --> 00:53:09,950
Can I make you some coffee?

866
00:53:09,951 --> 00:53:11,111
Um...

867
00:53:14,991 --> 00:53:16,550
No, thank you.

868
00:53:16,551 --> 00:53:21,710
I'm going to go to sleep for a bit,
then I might... try and go into work.

869
00:53:21,711 --> 00:53:24,670
Oh, surely no-one's going
to expect you in today.

870
00:53:24,671 --> 00:53:27,110
Could I...? What?

871
00:53:27,111 --> 00:53:29,550
I wanted to say something,
tell you something.

872
00:53:29,551 --> 00:53:31,271
What?

873
00:53:47,191 --> 00:53:49,071
I hate what's gone wrong between us.

874
00:53:49,072 --> 00:53:51,510
I don't know if you're ever going
to forgive me,

875
00:53:51,511 --> 00:53:55,870
but I made this deal with myself
that I would never lie to you
ever again.

876
00:53:55,871 --> 00:53:58,870
Or deceive you
in any way, shape or form,

877
00:53:58,871 --> 00:54:03,550
in the hope that one day,
you would possibly...

878
00:54:03,551 --> 00:54:07,830
So, I want you to know that
purely because I felt responsible,

879
00:54:07,831 --> 00:54:10,710
guilty, God knows...

880
00:54:10,711 --> 00:54:12,430
sorry for her,

881
00:54:12,431 --> 00:54:17,030
because she's so... pathetic, I lent...

882
00:54:17,031 --> 00:54:21,430
gave - Judith some money
for her rent.

883
00:54:21,431 --> 00:54:25,190
When?! This morning,
but I've made it clear to her
there's no more where that came from.

884
00:54:25,191 --> 00:54:29,110
And - and - I've told her
that I'd be telling you all about it.

885
00:54:29,111 --> 00:54:32,350
She rang up begging,

886
00:54:32,351 --> 00:54:33,830
begging!

887
00:54:33,831 --> 00:54:38,990
She's got almost no...
grasp on the realities of life.

888
00:54:38,991 --> 00:54:40,990
Aww. Poor bitch.

889
00:54:40,991 --> 00:54:42,671
I wish she didn't exist.

890
00:54:44,191 --> 00:54:47,710
Which is a terrible thing
to say about someone.

891
00:54:47,711 --> 00:54:51,590
I've been thinking. Yeah?

892
00:54:51,591 --> 00:54:56,510
This can work here. We can be civil,
can't we, for the boys?

893
00:54:56,511 --> 00:54:58,870
And like you said,
there's room for everyone.

894
00:54:58,871 --> 00:55:01,790
Sure. So?

895
00:55:01,791 --> 00:55:04,231
I'm seeing someone.

896
00:55:05,271 --> 00:55:07,470
Y-Y-Y... Mmm.

897
00:55:07,471 --> 00:55:09,070
You are? Mmm.

898
00:55:09,071 --> 00:55:10,790
You? Who?

899
00:55:10,791 --> 00:55:12,910
When? It's not...

900
00:55:12,911 --> 00:55:16,711
I don't know if it's
what I want entirely yet, but...

901
00:55:19,951 --> 00:55:22,070
I won't know if I don't try.

902
00:55:22,071 --> 00:55:23,590
Who?

903
00:55:23,591 --> 00:55:24,990
Someone. Who?!

904
00:55:24,991 --> 00:55:26,670
It doesn't matter! Matters to me!

905
00:55:26,671 --> 00:55:30,230
I'm not going to tell you
who it is, John, so...

906
00:55:30,231 --> 00:55:32,470
Someone at work?
Possibly. Possibly not.

907
00:55:32,471 --> 00:55:34,030
It is! You may think that.

908
00:55:34,031 --> 00:55:35,750
I couldn't possibly comment.

909
00:55:35,751 --> 00:55:37,190
Who? I'm going to bed.

910
00:55:37,191 --> 00:55:39,670
Who?! John! Who?!
That's the deal!

911
00:55:39,671 --> 00:55:41,831
Hang on, I'm not living
under the same roof as you

912
00:55:41,832 --> 00:55:43,950
while you're having it off
with someone else!

913
00:55:43,951 --> 00:55:46,150
Well, you know where the door is.

914
00:55:46,151 --> 00:55:47,989
Are you lying, Caroline?
Are you lying?!

915
00:55:47,990 --> 00:55:49,789
I don't do lies!
Well, who is it then?!

916
00:55:49,790 --> 00:55:51,271
No-one! Why's it a secret?!

917
00:55:51,272 --> 00:55:54,750
Because I don't want to have to
listen to any of your opinions

918
00:55:54,751 --> 00:55:57,870
and comments and
inane bloody rubbish.

919
00:55:57,871 --> 00:55:59,149
So it's someone I know!

920
00:55:59,150 --> 00:56:00,311
Maybe, maybe not!

921
00:56:00,312 --> 00:56:02,390
What's going on?! Nothing.

922
00:56:02,391 --> 00:56:04,150
Hi, kids!

923
00:56:04,151 --> 00:56:06,710
What's up?

924
00:56:06,711 --> 00:56:07,910
She's... What?

925
00:56:07,911 --> 00:56:08,991
Seeing someone.

926
00:56:08,992 --> 00:56:10,830
Mum? Yes.

927
00:56:10,831 --> 00:56:12,910
Mum?! Yes!

928
00:56:12,911 --> 00:56:15,471
Who? Some... I don't know!

929
00:56:16,671 --> 00:56:19,711
Does she bother with anyone
in particular at school?

930
00:56:27,471 --> 00:56:31,150
No. Don't be stupid!

931
00:56:31,151 --> 00:56:33,111
Caroline!

932
00:56:35,671 --> 00:56:36,990
Caroline!

933
00:56:36,991 --> 00:56:38,950
Caroline!

934
00:56:38,951 --> 00:56:40,551
Come on! Open the door!

935
00:56:41,551 --> 00:56:44,430
Where've you been? Where haven't I?
You're not moving him in here.

936
00:56:44,431 --> 00:56:46,310
I'm glad we... talked.

937
00:56:46,311 --> 00:56:48,271
Do you fancy going out
for a meal some time?

938
00:56:48,272 --> 00:56:50,831
- Keep having adventures!
- We're up Soyland!

939
00:56:52,151 --> 00:56:53,191
I've been used.

940
00:56:53,192 --> 00:56:55,950
Judith? Yeah. Mind where you're...

941
00:56:55,951 --> 00:56:59,150
to the back teeth of him.
You're not leaving him here!

942
00:56:59,151 --> 00:57:00,670
It's your fault he's in this mess.

943
00:57:00,671 --> 00:57:02,590
Hey! You're not dead, then.

944
00:57:02,591 --> 00:57:05,711
Have you thought about a best man?
I've never been a best man.

945
00:57:06,831 --> 00:57:08,391
Oh, I haven't a clue where John is.

946
00:57:08,392 --> 00:57:11,191
Celia! Oh, God!
What's happened?!

947
00:57:11,932 --> 00:57:46,720
