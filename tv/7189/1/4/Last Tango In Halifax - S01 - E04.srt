1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,400
Are you all right?
I just have a heart condition.

2
00:00:03,468 --> 00:00:07,546
If you ring me,
I'll run round here even though
I know you're not really interested.

3
00:00:08,226 --> 00:00:09,785
'I'm not NOT interested.'

4
00:00:09,786 --> 00:00:12,306
Raff? 'I assume he's seen the light,
worked out what'

5
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:16,768
a mad bitch you are. If he wants to
move in here, that's fine by me.

6
00:00:16,769 --> 00:00:19,968
Don't you dare fill his head
with rubbish about me.

7
00:00:19,969 --> 00:00:24,408
This marriage is over and I do not
want to waste another... Silly bitch!

8
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:27,859
Second of my life pretending
it's something worth saving!

9
00:00:29,139 --> 00:00:31,978
What's he doing here?
He's got nowhere else to go.

10
00:00:31,979 --> 00:00:34,778
What do you want? You couldn't
lend me some money, could you?

11
00:00:34,779 --> 00:00:38,578
Where would you like to get wed? You
can get wed anywhere now, you know.

12
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:41,458
Hello? Is anybody there?

13
00:00:41,503 --> 00:00:43,063
Oh, no!

14
00:00:45,044 --> 00:01:34,420
<font color="#3399CC">Subtitles by </font><font color="ffffff">MemoryOnSmells</font>
<font color="#3399CC">http://UKsubtitles.ru.</font>

15
00:01:34,503 --> 00:01:37,222
It's all safe now.
Why don't you get back in t'warm?

16
00:01:37,223 --> 00:01:39,823
We'll get off. Bye. Thanks.

17
00:01:56,903 --> 00:02:00,303
'Hello, this is Alan Buttershaw.
Please leave your message
after the tone.'

18
00:02:01,623 --> 00:02:05,103
Dad, it's me... again, just to say...

19
00:02:07,503 --> 00:02:11,862
where are you, basically,
and did you get my last message,

20
00:02:11,863 --> 00:02:14,702
about picking up a takeaway? Cos...

21
00:02:14,703 --> 00:02:18,023
I've not been able to think about
cooking with all this going on.

22
00:02:19,183 --> 00:02:20,262
Bye.

23
00:02:20,263 --> 00:02:22,982
I so didn't need this happening
right now.

24
00:02:22,983 --> 00:02:24,541
You'll have to ring your insurance.

25
00:02:24,542 --> 00:02:26,143
They'll give me about 50 quid
for it.

26
00:02:27,503 --> 00:02:29,782
How the hell am I going to buy
another one?

27
00:02:29,783 --> 00:02:31,182
You can use my car.

28
00:02:31,183 --> 00:02:32,223
Thanks.

29
00:02:34,063 --> 00:02:38,422
How'd it start? Oh, they don't know -
lightning... electrical fault...

30
00:02:38,423 --> 00:02:40,943
You don't think someone torched it?

31
00:02:44,383 --> 00:02:45,422
Like who?

32
00:02:45,423 --> 00:02:48,822
Cresswells. Hailey's stupid brothers.

33
00:02:48,823 --> 00:02:50,743
I wish me dad would get home.

34
00:02:51,863 --> 00:02:54,943
They should've been here
over an hour since.

35
00:03:01,143 --> 00:03:02,782
Ooh!

36
00:03:02,783 --> 00:03:05,143
D'you know,
I've had some poor cards.

37
00:03:10,343 --> 00:03:12,823
Oh, there she goes again.

38
00:03:14,823 --> 00:03:16,142
♪ With her 'ead...

39
00:03:16,143 --> 00:03:18,342
♪ ...tucked underneath her arm

40
00:03:18,343 --> 00:03:22,182
♪ She walks the bloody tower! ♪

41
00:03:22,183 --> 00:03:23,703
We're in here, love!

42
00:03:27,063 --> 00:03:28,823
You're right, it'll be a draught.

43
00:03:30,063 --> 00:03:36,102
House this size, this old,
it'd be odd if it didn't creak
and make a few noises.

44
00:03:36,103 --> 00:03:39,702
Shall we make another expedition
to t'water closet after this hand?

45
00:03:39,703 --> 00:03:41,342
Mmm, can do.

46
00:03:41,343 --> 00:03:45,062
I don't know why that telephone
at reception won't work.

47
00:03:45,063 --> 00:03:48,022
It's obviously connected.

48
00:03:48,023 --> 00:03:50,383
I'm amazed we've not set off
an alarm.

49
00:03:56,903 --> 00:04:00,543
D'you think anyone's realised
that we're missing?

50
00:04:12,503 --> 00:04:15,462
She's just here, just now,
let me ask her. Caroline...

51
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:17,622
What's all this mess? Dad's cooking.

52
00:04:17,623 --> 00:04:20,542
How was your exam? Good... ish.

53
00:04:20,543 --> 00:04:21,623
Answered everything?

54
00:04:21,624 --> 00:04:24,022
Mmm. No nasty surprises?

55
00:04:24,023 --> 00:04:25,702
Caroline, it's Gillian. Who?

56
00:04:25,703 --> 00:04:28,782
Slightly concerned cos she was under
the impression your mum and Alan

57
00:04:28,783 --> 00:04:30,583
were due at hers and they've not
turned up.

58
00:04:30,584 --> 00:04:32,382
So? They're adults.

59
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:34,422
Yes, but she was expecting them
at five.

60
00:04:34,423 --> 00:04:36,182
She's cooking for them, and...

61
00:04:36,183 --> 00:04:37,903
Do you want to talk to her?

62
00:04:44,423 --> 00:04:45,782
Gillian, hi!

63
00:04:45,783 --> 00:04:48,622
I was just ringing to see
if they were with you, that's all.

64
00:04:48,623 --> 00:04:51,742
Er, no, their car's not here.
They're not here, I just looked.

65
00:04:51,743 --> 00:04:54,302
I got the idea they were
leaving here first thing.

66
00:04:54,303 --> 00:04:55,463
They did, I know. I...

67
00:04:55,464 --> 00:04:58,622
I just wondered if they'd gone back
to Harrogate for whatever reason.

68
00:04:58,623 --> 00:05:00,062
I don't think so.

69
00:05:00,063 --> 00:05:01,543
Has your mum got a mobile?

70
00:05:01,544 --> 00:05:04,102
Yes.
Would you mind ringing her for me?

71
00:05:04,103 --> 00:05:06,662
I don't mind 'em being late
just so long as they're all right.

72
00:05:06,663 --> 00:05:09,342
Sure. I'll get back to you,
give me a minute.

73
00:05:09,343 --> 00:05:11,182
Thank you. 'Bye.'

74
00:05:11,183 --> 00:05:12,223
Bye-bye.

75
00:05:15,103 --> 00:05:18,222
Why is she ringing you on your
mobile? Why? Well...

76
00:05:18,223 --> 00:05:21,702
'Hello, this is Celia...' Shush!
'..Dawson. Please leave a message.'

77
00:05:21,703 --> 00:05:23,182
'Thank you.'

78
00:05:23,183 --> 00:05:24,423
Hi, Mum, it's me.

79
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:27,543
Can you give me a ring when you get
this message, please? Thank you.
Bye.

80
00:05:28,663 --> 00:05:31,503
I, er, need Gillian's number.

81
00:05:34,023 --> 00:05:37,783
07700 900 827.

82
00:05:39,143 --> 00:05:42,862
I rang her to say thank you
for letting me stay at her house
after you drove off without me.

83
00:05:42,863 --> 00:05:45,181
I got her number from Alan
when he drove me over here.

84
00:05:45,182 --> 00:05:46,383
And you saved it.

85
00:05:46,384 --> 00:05:50,142
Well, yes, not, not, not...
You're transparent.

86
00:05:50,143 --> 00:05:51,902
'Hello?'

87
00:05:51,903 --> 00:05:54,222
Gillian, hi. I'm just getting
voice mail.

88
00:05:54,223 --> 00:05:56,862
'OK.' I'm sure they'll turn up.

89
00:05:56,863 --> 00:06:00,903
I just worry about me dad
having his pills on him, you know...

90
00:06:02,023 --> 00:06:03,063
for his heart.

91
00:06:03,064 --> 00:06:05,062
Oh, God, yeah, of course.

92
00:06:05,063 --> 00:06:08,302
'And he wouldn't not ring
if he knew he was going to be late,

93
00:06:08,303 --> 00:06:10,143
'when he knew I was
cooking for 'em.'

94
00:06:10,144 --> 00:06:11,263
He's just...

95
00:06:12,423 --> 00:06:15,262
He's polite, he's thoughtful.

96
00:06:15,263 --> 00:06:18,542
Has he any friends or relatives
they might have visited?

97
00:06:18,543 --> 00:06:21,502
Yeah. Yeah, I just thought
I'd try you first.

98
00:06:21,503 --> 00:06:23,182
I'll keep trying her number.

99
00:06:23,183 --> 00:06:24,422
Thanks.

100
00:06:24,423 --> 00:06:27,422
'Will you ring me?' Course.

101
00:06:27,423 --> 00:06:30,262
OK, bye. They've probably just
got carried away

102
00:06:30,263 --> 00:06:32,463
doing something
and forgotten to look at the clock.

103
00:06:32,464 --> 00:06:34,702
Yeah, whatever. I'm cooking.

104
00:06:34,703 --> 00:06:36,383
Not for me. I don't want your filth.

105
00:06:36,384 --> 00:06:39,822
You see, that's just...
I have a timetable.
I know what I'm cooking, when.

106
00:06:39,823 --> 00:06:43,142
That's the way you organise yourself
when you have two strapping
teenagers,

107
00:06:43,143 --> 00:06:45,702
a demanding, time-consuming,
full-time job,

108
00:06:45,703 --> 00:06:48,303
and a husband who dumps you
for an alcoholic.

109
00:06:50,023 --> 00:06:52,183
What's happening with Granny?
Oh, er...

110
00:06:53,743 --> 00:06:56,982
Her and Alan haven't turned up at
Gillian's when they're supposed to,

111
00:06:56,983 --> 00:06:58,422
and... she's, er...

112
00:06:58,423 --> 00:06:59,823
worried about where they are.

113
00:07:02,103 --> 00:07:03,303
I'll get changed.

114
00:07:12,143 --> 00:07:14,462
Ee, it's got a grand flush,
that toilet.

115
00:07:14,463 --> 00:07:17,782
They built things properly,
didn't they, the Victorians?

116
00:07:17,783 --> 00:07:20,542
Well, strictly speaking,
it's Georgian.

117
00:07:20,543 --> 00:07:23,262
1836, North Tower were completed...

118
00:07:23,263 --> 00:07:26,662
year before Victoria
ascended t'throne.

119
00:07:26,663 --> 00:07:29,902
Oh, very good.
"Main body of the house..."

120
00:07:29,903 --> 00:07:34,222
Here, I didn't know it were
this old - dates back to 1514!

121
00:07:34,223 --> 00:07:35,822
Oh, fancy!

122
00:07:35,823 --> 00:07:39,182
Yeah, it's a good job
we didn't try smashing a window.

123
00:07:39,183 --> 00:07:45,582
Stained glass is original medieval -
it's unique, it's priceless.

124
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:46,623
Heck!

125
00:07:47,903 --> 00:07:51,502
There she blows.
I wish she wouldn't.

126
00:07:51,503 --> 00:07:53,303
We're in t'cludgie, missus!

127
00:08:00,903 --> 00:08:02,782
There's somebody up there.

128
00:08:02,783 --> 00:08:03,823
Hello!

129
00:08:05,383 --> 00:08:08,022
Oh, shit!
No, no, no, we're all right.

130
00:08:08,023 --> 00:08:09,863
What are we going to do?

131
00:08:11,023 --> 00:08:12,103
Hello!

132
00:08:15,383 --> 00:08:17,783
We're going to go back up to
t'bedroom...

133
00:08:19,463 --> 00:08:22,383
and shut t'door... and play cards.

134
00:08:23,383 --> 00:08:25,662
Hello!

135
00:08:25,663 --> 00:08:29,583
We got shut in! We're not burglars!
We're pensioners!

136
00:08:30,823 --> 00:08:31,863
Hello!

137
00:08:35,783 --> 00:08:37,503
What was that?

138
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:40,622
Nothing.

139
00:08:40,623 --> 00:08:42,143
It's nothing.

140
00:08:45,023 --> 00:08:48,263
Are you all right? Gillian?

141
00:08:50,183 --> 00:08:53,303
I just want to know that he's
all right, that's all.

142
00:09:00,023 --> 00:09:01,902
Who were that? Her.

143
00:09:01,903 --> 00:09:03,623
Your mother. Who else?

144
00:09:04,663 --> 00:09:06,062
Mad bitch!

145
00:09:06,063 --> 00:09:07,822
Paul Jatri.

146
00:09:07,823 --> 00:09:09,902
I know! Paul bloody Jatri!

147
00:09:09,903 --> 00:09:11,462
I know! Why?

148
00:09:11,463 --> 00:09:12,862
God knows.

149
00:09:12,863 --> 00:09:15,302
No, really... you know, why?

150
00:09:15,303 --> 00:09:17,222
You're asking t'wrong person.

151
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:20,862
Apart from t'fact that he's engaged
to Neil Cresswell's lass,

152
00:09:20,863 --> 00:09:23,662
he's got a mental age of
a blancmange. He's retarded.

153
00:09:23,663 --> 00:09:26,462
Well, probably not his brain
she's bothering with him for, is it?

154
00:09:26,463 --> 00:09:30,063
Bloody screw loose, I tell you,
she always has had. Yeah, all right!

155
00:09:31,703 --> 00:09:33,623
All right.

156
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:36,902
Sorry.

157
00:09:36,903 --> 00:09:38,143
Sorry.

158
00:09:39,303 --> 00:09:41,902
Right, I'm going to drive over
to Halifax.

159
00:09:41,903 --> 00:09:43,022
Really?

160
00:09:43,023 --> 00:09:46,822
Yeah. Why don't I give it
till nine o'clock?

161
00:09:46,823 --> 00:09:50,222
Yep, I'll give it till nine and if
we still haven't heard anything,
I'll...

162
00:09:50,223 --> 00:09:54,743
Do you want me to come with you,
Mum? No, no, you've got school
tomorrow.

163
00:10:01,783 --> 00:10:03,662
Hello!

164
00:10:03,663 --> 00:10:05,462
Robbie, it's Gillian.

165
00:10:05,463 --> 00:10:07,062
Yeah, I thought it might be.

166
00:10:07,063 --> 00:10:10,342
Me dad hasn't turned up...
when he was supposed to,

167
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:14,542
couple of hours ago now,
and I wanted to know
if Raff had seen him

168
00:10:14,543 --> 00:10:17,342
or had a phone call from him
or anything.

169
00:10:17,343 --> 00:10:19,702
'Is he there?'
Is that the best you can do?

170
00:10:19,703 --> 00:10:21,982
I'm sorry? 'Excuses for ringing up.'

171
00:10:21,983 --> 00:10:25,263
I'm not mucking about, Robbie.
He's got his heart problem.

172
00:10:27,023 --> 00:10:30,303
I just want to know if Raff's heard
from him. It's that simple.

173
00:10:32,343 --> 00:10:34,303
Raff? Mmm?

174
00:10:35,463 --> 00:10:38,103
Come on, summat about your granddad.

175
00:10:42,663 --> 00:10:44,742
What d'you want?

176
00:10:44,743 --> 00:10:46,943
Have you heard from Granddad
at all this evening?

177
00:10:46,944 --> 00:10:49,302
'No.' He's not rung you, or...?

178
00:10:49,303 --> 00:10:50,422
Why?

179
00:10:50,423 --> 00:10:53,622
'Because I was expecting him
at five for tea...

180
00:10:53,623 --> 00:10:55,502
'him and Celia -'

181
00:10:55,503 --> 00:10:56,983
and they've not turned up.

182
00:10:56,984 --> 00:11:00,022
Where were they last time you spoke?
In a cafe in Elland,

183
00:11:00,023 --> 00:11:02,342
'two o'clock.'
Have you tried ringing him since?

184
00:11:02,343 --> 00:11:03,903
Course I've...!

185
00:11:05,703 --> 00:11:07,702
I'm ringing him every ten minutes.

186
00:11:07,703 --> 00:11:10,302
'So... Well, what are you
going to do?'

187
00:11:10,303 --> 00:11:13,263
I'll have to ring round
the hospitals, won't I?

188
00:11:14,263 --> 00:11:15,902
Well, do you want me to do owt?

189
00:11:15,903 --> 00:11:17,742
No.

190
00:11:17,743 --> 00:11:19,263
Do you want me to go looking
for him?

191
00:11:20,263 --> 00:11:21,543
No.

192
00:11:22,903 --> 00:11:24,783
Do you want me to come over?

193
00:11:25,983 --> 00:11:27,343
If you want.

194
00:11:28,503 --> 00:11:30,383
Is that twat still lying
on our settee?

195
00:11:30,384 --> 00:11:36,022
If you want to come over and
help me think about what to do next,

196
00:11:36,023 --> 00:11:37,383
'you'd be very welcome.'

197
00:11:39,383 --> 00:11:40,863
Have you done your homework?

198
00:11:49,623 --> 00:11:51,702
We should sue. You what?

199
00:11:51,703 --> 00:11:55,702
In the morning, when we get out
of this godforsaken hole,
we should sue.

200
00:11:55,703 --> 00:11:59,782
This is entrapment.
Well, negligence.

201
00:11:59,783 --> 00:12:01,743
I mean, what if someone...?

202
00:12:03,303 --> 00:12:06,862
Have you got your pills?
I'll be reet.

203
00:12:06,863 --> 00:12:08,503
Come on, get in.

204
00:12:10,703 --> 00:12:12,742
Happen they weren't footsteps.

205
00:12:12,743 --> 00:12:15,622
Happen... just sounds a house makes.

206
00:12:15,623 --> 00:12:17,982
A house this old, this big,

207
00:12:17,983 --> 00:12:19,542
can sound like... Yeah.

208
00:12:19,543 --> 00:12:21,863
Anything, anything you want it
to sound like.

209
00:12:23,263 --> 00:12:26,782
I don't believe in ghosts.
Neither do I.

210
00:12:26,783 --> 00:12:30,342
I think once you've cashed your
chips - pfft! - that's it.

211
00:12:30,343 --> 00:12:32,303
Yeah...

212
00:12:33,303 --> 00:12:34,743
although...

213
00:12:36,343 --> 00:12:37,382
What?

214
00:12:37,383 --> 00:12:41,062
I've always thought there's more
between heaven and earth

215
00:12:41,063 --> 00:12:43,982
than any of us ever know about.

216
00:12:43,983 --> 00:12:45,583
Oh, well...

217
00:12:46,743 --> 00:12:47,903
Aye.

218
00:12:51,703 --> 00:12:56,103
Was that... candle on
that table... before?

219
00:13:04,463 --> 00:13:06,262
Have they turned up?

220
00:13:06,263 --> 00:13:09,382
No, they haven't. You don't have to
knock, you know, you can just
come in.

221
00:13:09,383 --> 00:13:10,663
Come in!

222
00:13:14,223 --> 00:13:17,142
What happened to t'Land Rover?
Blew up.

223
00:13:17,143 --> 00:13:19,702
How?
Lightning, electrical fault...

224
00:13:19,703 --> 00:13:22,582
or someone torched it. Torched it?!

225
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:24,943
When? Just after you left.

226
00:13:26,703 --> 00:13:28,342
It were probably lightning.

227
00:13:28,343 --> 00:13:30,703
Well, how are you going to
manage...? I'll manage.

228
00:13:31,903 --> 00:13:35,742
Robbie thought we should come over,
help look for me granddad.

229
00:13:35,743 --> 00:13:38,702
Did he? Right, well...

230
00:13:38,703 --> 00:13:39,822
thanks.

231
00:13:39,823 --> 00:13:42,342
Have you reported it to t'police? No.

232
00:13:42,343 --> 00:13:44,862
Is that them?

233
00:13:44,863 --> 00:13:46,023
Is it?

234
00:13:47,383 --> 00:13:48,743
Doesn't look like.

235
00:13:50,863 --> 00:13:54,182
It's Harry and Maurice.
Your granddad's buddies.

236
00:13:54,183 --> 00:13:57,902
Do you think it's that serious?
Do you think I should report it
to the police?

237
00:13:57,903 --> 00:14:00,982
It's up to you.
I'm asking your advice.

238
00:14:00,983 --> 00:14:04,502
Well, you can report it
any time you like.

239
00:14:04,503 --> 00:14:07,742
There's a legitimate cause for
concern cos of his heart condition.

240
00:14:07,743 --> 00:14:09,582
Oh, God.

241
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:10,783
D'you wanna...?

242
00:14:17,623 --> 00:14:19,502
You all right, love?

243
00:14:19,503 --> 00:14:22,702
I rang Silly Bugger but he's not
heard owt from 'em either.

244
00:14:22,703 --> 00:14:26,102
Good evening, Gillian.
I'm sure there's a perfectly simple
explanation.

245
00:14:26,103 --> 00:14:28,063
You'd hope so, wouldn't you?

246
00:14:29,063 --> 00:14:30,623
Cavalry's arrived.

247
00:14:32,143 --> 00:14:34,262
Tell you what. What?

248
00:14:34,263 --> 00:14:35,462
It's raining.

249
00:14:35,463 --> 00:14:37,863
You all right, Raff, lad?
Not so bad.

250
00:14:39,063 --> 00:14:41,582
My God! What's happened to him?

251
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:42,942
Eh?

252
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:44,942
You all right, love? Er...

253
00:14:44,943 --> 00:14:47,982
So, what's the latest, Gillian?

254
00:14:47,983 --> 00:14:50,982
I've run round the hospitals,
but of course that doesn't mean

255
00:14:50,983 --> 00:14:54,262
they haven't gone off the side of
the road somewhere up in t'wilds,
but...

256
00:14:54,263 --> 00:14:55,543
Nay, they'll be right.

257
00:14:55,544 --> 00:14:59,142
How do you know he hasn't taken her
to some hotel somewhere

258
00:14:59,143 --> 00:15:02,302
for a wild night of
nudge-nudge wink-wink?

259
00:15:02,303 --> 00:15:04,942
It's all he thinks about.

260
00:15:04,943 --> 00:15:06,222
Is it 'ell.

261
00:15:06,223 --> 00:15:09,582
I don't know, that, Harry,
I just... I think he'd have rung me.

262
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:11,942
So, at what stage do we report it
to the police?

263
00:15:11,943 --> 00:15:14,542
Well, Robbie's...
I've told her any time.

264
00:15:14,543 --> 00:15:16,142
Given his, er...

265
00:15:16,143 --> 00:15:19,022
I thought I'd leave it while 11,
and then...

266
00:15:19,023 --> 00:15:20,382
Nay. Get 'em rung.

267
00:15:20,383 --> 00:15:23,942
Well, I don't want to... overreact.

268
00:15:23,943 --> 00:15:27,742
You don't want to think the worst.
That's the thing.

269
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:30,543
But... given his...

270
00:15:32,223 --> 00:15:35,863
They'll be grateful, t'police -
probably got bugger all else to do.

271
00:15:38,263 --> 00:15:41,022
Don't look at me like that.
I tell it like it is.

272
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:45,902
Well, I would, but he has,
on occasion, been out supping
with you lot all hours

273
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:48,902
before now,
then turned up talking gibberish

274
00:15:48,903 --> 00:15:51,862
with his trouser legs rolled up
and his coat on inside out.

275
00:15:51,863 --> 00:15:55,982
Yes, well, that was... unfortunate.

276
00:15:55,983 --> 00:15:59,063
It were his birthday!
What's up with you?

277
00:16:01,703 --> 00:16:06,222
Missing? No, just not turned up
when they were supposed to.

278
00:16:06,223 --> 00:16:08,222
So, well, where do you think
they are?

279
00:16:08,223 --> 00:16:12,142
I've got no idea!
Nobody does, that's...

280
00:16:12,143 --> 00:16:14,342
I'm sorry, Kate. I'm just...

281
00:16:14,343 --> 00:16:16,382
Wound up? Course you are.
That's all right.

282
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:18,142
I'm sure she's absolutely...

283
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:19,662
Course. Of course.

284
00:16:19,663 --> 00:16:23,982
She doesn't go out after dark,
as a rule, though, that's the thing.

285
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:25,743
Her eyes aren't what they were,
and...

286
00:16:26,783 --> 00:16:28,582
There'll be an explanation.

287
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:31,302
Listen, ring me
if there's anything I can do.

288
00:16:31,303 --> 00:16:34,222
Or if you just want to talk
to someone.

289
00:16:34,223 --> 00:16:36,342
What were you ringing me for?

290
00:16:36,343 --> 00:16:38,702
Oh!

291
00:16:38,703 --> 00:16:40,943
It doesn't seem so important now.

292
00:16:42,063 --> 00:16:45,143
Just... you said we should go away.

293
00:16:46,183 --> 00:16:47,463
'For the weekend.

294
00:16:47,464 --> 00:16:50,062
'Together, somewhere, possibly.

295
00:16:50,063 --> 00:16:53,822
'And I wanted to know if you
meant it, and if you did, '

296
00:16:53,823 --> 00:16:56,223
if I should fix something up.

297
00:16:59,463 --> 00:17:01,662
Can we talk about it later?

298
00:17:01,663 --> 00:17:02,863
Yeah, of course.

299
00:17:28,423 --> 00:17:32,662
Hi. Is there any news? Me mum's
through there with Robbie talking
to a uniform.

300
00:17:32,663 --> 00:17:35,302
Are you Celia's lass?

301
00:17:35,303 --> 00:17:36,342
Yes, that's...

302
00:17:36,343 --> 00:17:38,462
Harry Wallace.

303
00:17:38,463 --> 00:17:39,822
This is Maurice Price.

304
00:17:39,823 --> 00:17:42,582
They're me granddad's pals. Ah.

305
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:45,582
I hope your mother's not been
leading him astray. Been...?

306
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:48,302
Shut up. Lass is worried.

307
00:17:48,303 --> 00:17:50,223
She knows I'm joking.

308
00:17:51,223 --> 00:17:54,222
I understand you're a doctor!

309
00:17:54,223 --> 00:17:56,182
I'm... Yeah.

310
00:17:56,183 --> 00:17:57,222
Is she?

311
00:17:57,223 --> 00:17:58,902
Will you look at my foot?

312
00:17:58,903 --> 00:18:02,542
Put your foot away.
I've got poor circulation.

313
00:18:02,543 --> 00:18:04,862
I'm not a medical doctor.

314
00:18:04,863 --> 00:18:07,222
What then, then? Chemistry.

315
00:18:07,223 --> 00:18:09,382
Chemistry, can they do that?

316
00:18:09,383 --> 00:18:11,262
Ignore him.

317
00:18:11,263 --> 00:18:12,422
He's rural.

318
00:18:12,423 --> 00:18:16,182
I've a hernia as well. I think it's
a hernia. Do you want to have a look?

319
00:18:16,183 --> 00:18:17,863
It's not really my...

320
00:18:18,983 --> 00:18:22,422
Do we know what's happening?
There's been no developments.

321
00:18:22,423 --> 00:18:25,983
Why don't you sit down, love?

322
00:18:29,183 --> 00:18:31,742
Chemistry.

323
00:18:31,743 --> 00:18:34,702
Margaret Thatcher read chemistry
at Oxford.

324
00:18:34,703 --> 00:18:36,742
Yes, well, I was in
a different college.

325
00:18:36,743 --> 00:18:38,743
Yeah, and I'd be apologising an' all.

326
00:18:41,983 --> 00:18:44,462
What's happened? Nothing. Nothing.

327
00:18:44,463 --> 00:18:48,982
It were just, like I said
on t'phone, we decided
there was nothing to lose,

328
00:18:48,983 --> 00:18:53,383
reporting 'em missing
sooner rather than later, so...

329
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:57,583
Are you all right?
Yeah. Yeah. Are you?

330
00:18:58,663 --> 00:19:00,422
Yeah.

331
00:19:00,423 --> 00:19:03,822
They've taken a description,
and they can...

332
00:19:03,823 --> 00:19:07,102
What are they going to do, Robbie?
Check when the bank cards
were last used,

333
00:19:07,103 --> 00:19:09,822
when their mobiles were last used.
And then we'll run

334
00:19:09,823 --> 00:19:12,262
an ANPR check on their vehicle.
What's that?

335
00:19:12,263 --> 00:19:15,262
Double Dutch. It's like vehicle
plate recognition.

336
00:19:15,263 --> 00:19:18,902
We can see where they were last
picked up on cameras.
See where they were heading.

337
00:19:18,903 --> 00:19:23,222
So when will we know anything?
As soon as we get authority from
upstairs to pursue it.

338
00:19:23,223 --> 00:19:27,342
The lad that we spoke to is going
straight up to see t'Super, so...

339
00:19:27,343 --> 00:19:28,543
Best thing we can...

340
00:19:28,544 --> 00:19:30,541
They said best thing we can do
is go home.

341
00:19:30,542 --> 00:19:32,423
They'll ring us when they know owt.

342
00:19:32,424 --> 00:19:34,662
Why don't you go home, lads?

343
00:19:34,663 --> 00:19:38,303
I'll ring you if I need you.
If there's any news.

344
00:19:49,423 --> 00:19:52,983
'Hello, this is Celia Dawson.
Please leave...'

345
00:19:58,343 --> 00:19:59,942
Who IS that?

346
00:19:59,943 --> 00:20:02,542
Paul... Jatri.

347
00:20:02,543 --> 00:20:04,782
He's an idiot.

348
00:20:04,783 --> 00:20:07,382
Paul Jat...?
Is that the bloke you...?

349
00:20:07,383 --> 00:20:10,022
Yeah. But I didn't do that to him.

350
00:20:10,023 --> 00:20:12,182
I just bruised him.

351
00:20:12,183 --> 00:20:13,983
That was somebody else.

352
00:20:15,143 --> 00:20:16,542
Right.

353
00:20:16,543 --> 00:20:17,783
He's not popular.

354
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:21,902
So what's... What's he doing here?

355
00:20:21,903 --> 00:20:24,342
That's a good question.

356
00:20:24,343 --> 00:20:26,183
Don't ask.

357
00:20:35,423 --> 00:20:37,263
What were you doing
with that dipstick?

358
00:20:37,264 --> 00:20:38,942
Don't start on me, I've enough on.

359
00:20:38,943 --> 00:20:40,302
I just...

360
00:20:40,303 --> 00:20:41,623
What I do is...

361
00:20:42,823 --> 00:20:44,103
You think I'm going to be a nun?

362
00:20:44,104 --> 00:20:46,782
No! No.
Eddie's been dead for ten years.

363
00:20:46,783 --> 00:20:50,142
D'you seriously think I haven't
slept with other people since then?

364
00:20:50,143 --> 00:20:53,022
I just... What's it to you?

365
00:20:53,023 --> 00:20:54,863
I'm sorry.

366
00:20:56,503 --> 00:20:58,981
About all the unpleasantness
there's been between us.

367
00:20:58,982 --> 00:21:00,143
Unpleasantness?

368
00:21:00,144 --> 00:21:03,742
Trying to convince people
that I've got a screw loose?

369
00:21:03,743 --> 00:21:07,662
That I murdered my own husband?
Trying to make Raffy believe that?
I was lashing out.

370
00:21:07,663 --> 00:21:09,583
For ten years? I'm sorry.

371
00:21:11,023 --> 00:21:12,063
I just think...

372
00:21:13,263 --> 00:21:14,543
you let yourself down.

373
00:21:14,544 --> 00:21:18,463
Bothering with a streak
of... whatever, like him.

374
00:21:19,663 --> 00:21:21,142
You're better than that.

375
00:21:21,143 --> 00:21:22,223
I thought...

376
00:21:24,743 --> 00:21:30,382
after Eddie died,
you of all people

377
00:21:30,383 --> 00:21:32,863
would help me, support me.

378
00:21:34,143 --> 00:21:36,143
Shit, I was wrong, wasn't it?

379
00:21:37,183 --> 00:21:40,022
D'you think I'm going to forget
what you tried to do to me?

380
00:21:40,023 --> 00:21:41,982
What you put me through?

381
00:21:41,983 --> 00:21:44,262
We could make an all-right team.

382
00:21:44,263 --> 00:21:48,743
You, me, an' Raff, couldn't we?

383
00:21:51,103 --> 00:21:52,662
Did you torch my Land Rover?

384
00:21:52,663 --> 00:21:54,182
No!

385
00:21:54,183 --> 00:21:56,143
If the Cresswells did, I will...

386
00:21:58,023 --> 00:21:59,383
I'll get 'em.

387
00:22:01,943 --> 00:22:03,823
That's...

388
00:22:05,423 --> 00:22:06,703
Um...

389
00:22:09,423 --> 00:22:12,223
I'm appreciating the apology,
Robbie.

390
00:22:21,543 --> 00:22:22,583
It's fine.

391
00:22:25,543 --> 00:22:27,222
Go to bed.

392
00:22:27,223 --> 00:22:30,102
I'll let you know the second we hear
owt.

393
00:22:30,103 --> 00:22:31,863
There's nowt any of us can do.

394
00:22:33,263 --> 00:22:36,583
Go shut your eyes at least,
you've got school tomorrow.

395
00:22:40,023 --> 00:22:41,462
Hello?

396
00:22:41,463 --> 00:22:42,623
Yes, it is.

397
00:22:43,703 --> 00:22:44,983
Oh, yeah.

398
00:22:45,983 --> 00:22:47,463
4.32, right.

399
00:22:48,943 --> 00:22:50,063
Towards Bradford?!

400
00:22:51,343 --> 00:22:53,222
Godley Lane?

401
00:22:53,223 --> 00:22:55,502
He doesn't know anybody
over that way.

402
00:22:55,503 --> 00:22:56,743
Hang on a minute.

403
00:22:56,744 --> 00:23:00,302
They were caught on camera,
or their registration number was.

404
00:23:00,303 --> 00:23:05,023
Driving up Godley Lane, the other
side of Halifax, towards Bradford.

405
00:23:06,023 --> 00:23:08,143
No further sightings. Right.
So you're...?

406
00:23:09,783 --> 00:23:13,742
They're concentrating on that area
round there initially.

407
00:23:13,743 --> 00:23:15,143
What is there around there?

408
00:23:15,144 --> 00:23:18,062
There's nothing, there's Southowram
Hall, that's about it.

409
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:20,862
You can get married
at Southowram Hall. What's he said?

410
00:23:20,863 --> 00:23:23,382
He said you can get married
at Southowram Hall.

411
00:23:23,383 --> 00:23:25,383
They were looking for
a wedding venue.

412
00:24:09,543 --> 00:24:12,262
Are you and Mum still getting
divorced then now, or what?

413
00:24:12,263 --> 00:24:13,822
Oh, well...

414
00:24:13,823 --> 00:24:16,102
I'm afraid I don't know.

415
00:24:16,103 --> 00:24:17,383
Can't you win her round?

416
00:24:17,384 --> 00:24:20,662
Can't you... buy her some flowers
or something?

417
00:24:20,663 --> 00:24:22,902
Well, I had. Almost.

418
00:24:22,903 --> 00:24:25,102
Won her round. I think. And then...

419
00:24:25,103 --> 00:24:27,942
Don't you blame me. I wasn't!

420
00:24:27,943 --> 00:24:29,302
I wasn't.

421
00:24:29,303 --> 00:24:31,302
Although you did
get the wrong end of the stick.

422
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:34,902
Yeah, well, if you hadn't
started seeing that... bitch
in the first place,

423
00:24:34,903 --> 00:24:38,662
there wouldn't be any wrong end
of any sticks for anybody
to get hold of, would there?

424
00:24:38,663 --> 00:24:43,142
Yeah, fine. Are we really going to
argue about this now? The point is,
you're not seeing Judith any more,

425
00:24:43,143 --> 00:24:45,063
so you don't need to get divorced
any more.

426
00:24:45,064 --> 00:24:48,982
No, the point is,
she can't trust him any more,
any further than she can throw him.

427
00:24:48,983 --> 00:24:53,022
So it's not just as naive and dumb
as saying, "Can't you buy her
some flowers?!"

428
00:24:53,023 --> 00:24:54,383
Piss off! Yeah, well, grow up!

429
00:24:54,384 --> 00:24:56,943
You grow up! Just calm down. Stop it!
Stop it.

430
00:24:57,983 --> 00:25:01,903
We're all worried about Gran,
and this isn't a good way to...

431
00:25:06,063 --> 00:25:07,863
I'm sure me and Mum can
sort things out.

432
00:25:07,864 --> 00:25:11,463
These things take time, sometimes,
that's all.

433
00:25:15,823 --> 00:25:17,503
And a bit of goodwill.

434
00:25:19,423 --> 00:25:22,823
I'm sorry I inflicted my husband
on you the other day.

435
00:25:23,983 --> 00:25:27,462
Oh, well, don't apologise.

436
00:25:27,463 --> 00:25:30,422
I'm sorry my son got arrested
in front of you all...

437
00:25:30,423 --> 00:25:33,142
by his own...

438
00:25:33,143 --> 00:25:34,422
uncle.

439
00:25:34,423 --> 00:25:38,942
So he... Raff beat up the bloke
that's lying on your couch.

440
00:25:38,943 --> 00:25:41,462
Yeah. Yeah, he...

441
00:25:41,463 --> 00:25:43,383
He's Paul. He's...

442
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:46,182
We're friends, me and Paul,

443
00:25:46,183 --> 00:25:49,022
and Raff got it into his head
that we were more than friends

444
00:25:49,023 --> 00:25:51,303
and he didn't like that. So he...

445
00:25:52,543 --> 00:25:55,623
Then someone else beat him up
even more? Yeah.

446
00:25:57,023 --> 00:26:00,142
His girlfriend's brothers got wind
of what'd been said,

447
00:26:00,143 --> 00:26:03,343
and, well,
they're a pretty unpleasant lot.

448
00:26:04,583 --> 00:26:09,303
Oh... He's got broken limbs
because of some misunderstanding?

449
00:26:13,183 --> 00:26:17,022
So, has everything settled down?

450
00:26:17,023 --> 00:26:20,742
Then? Now? Er, at your end?

451
00:26:20,743 --> 00:26:22,142
Or...?

452
00:26:22,143 --> 00:26:23,823
Oh! Er...

453
00:26:25,943 --> 00:26:27,902
Me and John.

454
00:26:27,903 --> 00:26:28,943
Yeah.

455
00:26:30,063 --> 00:26:31,503
It's beyond that.

456
00:26:34,743 --> 00:26:36,023
What did he tell you?

457
00:26:37,663 --> 00:26:39,143
Oh, that, er...

458
00:26:40,743 --> 00:26:42,462
he'd had a fling,

459
00:26:42,463 --> 00:26:44,502
and...

460
00:26:44,503 --> 00:26:46,822
Yeah, that he wished he hadn't.

461
00:26:46,823 --> 00:26:49,823
Really?
Mmm. And that he wanted just to...

462
00:26:51,703 --> 00:26:53,342
get back with you.

463
00:26:53,343 --> 00:26:57,582
Well, he'd do it again tomorrow
if he met someone else he wanted
to do it with.

464
00:26:57,583 --> 00:26:59,703
That's how sorry he is.

465
00:27:01,823 --> 00:27:03,743
Are you all right?

466
00:27:04,743 --> 00:27:06,143
Tired.

467
00:27:07,503 --> 00:27:09,502
Where the hell are they?!

468
00:27:09,503 --> 00:27:10,862
Sorry.

469
00:27:10,863 --> 00:27:13,182
I'm sorry. That helps no-one.

470
00:27:13,183 --> 00:27:17,983
No, you're all right. You're
worried. Have a drop of brandy.
Yes, actually.

471
00:27:40,543 --> 00:27:43,423
It wasn't, er, a misunderstanding.

472
00:27:45,583 --> 00:27:46,983
I...

473
00:27:49,183 --> 00:27:52,263
I don't know. I don't even know
why I'm telling you.

474
00:27:57,183 --> 00:28:00,662
Except that Raff doesn't generally
behave like that.

475
00:28:00,663 --> 00:28:04,142
He's... He's not a thug.
He's a grand lad.

476
00:28:04,143 --> 00:28:05,983
Better than I deserve.

477
00:28:07,743 --> 00:28:09,103
He's like my dad.

478
00:28:10,343 --> 00:28:11,503
He's got a big streak

479
00:28:11,504 --> 00:28:14,423
of something very decent
etched right through him.

480
00:28:16,463 --> 00:28:17,863
And I haven't.

481
00:28:19,303 --> 00:28:20,503
I'm a mess.

482
00:28:21,983 --> 00:28:23,382
Well, you know that.

483
00:28:23,383 --> 00:28:26,142
Put your finger on it
the first time you met me.

484
00:28:26,143 --> 00:28:30,823
I shouldn't have said that. It was
stupid. I didn't mean it, it was...

485
00:28:32,463 --> 00:28:33,863
I've been...

486
00:28:38,703 --> 00:28:40,663
I've been depressed.

487
00:28:42,063 --> 00:28:43,662
For months.

488
00:28:43,663 --> 00:28:45,382
Bottling things up and then...

489
00:28:45,383 --> 00:28:49,422
it comes out, and you say things -
silly, nasty, stupid things,

490
00:28:49,423 --> 00:28:51,903
things you don't even mean,
and it's since...

491
00:28:55,023 --> 00:28:56,503
It's since...

492
00:29:00,463 --> 00:29:03,662
I feel like I'm only just
holding my job down, most days,

493
00:29:03,663 --> 00:29:05,223
and that's...

494
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:09,142
It's terrifying.

495
00:29:09,143 --> 00:29:12,183
Sorry, you don't need to know that,
either.

496
00:29:22,143 --> 00:29:23,463
Hello?

497
00:29:25,383 --> 00:29:26,982
They've found the car.

498
00:29:26,983 --> 00:29:30,502
In the car park above Southowram Hall
in Cumbry Wood.

499
00:29:30,503 --> 00:29:32,422
But not them?

500
00:29:32,423 --> 00:29:33,502
Hello?

501
00:29:33,503 --> 00:29:36,382
We're turning a good number of
officers out now.

502
00:29:36,383 --> 00:29:38,702
Is there anywhere at all
in the vicinity

503
00:29:38,703 --> 00:29:41,503
where you think they're most likely
to have gone?

504
00:29:42,823 --> 00:29:45,342
Can I help you? I'm the curator.
Your sergeant rang me.

505
00:29:45,343 --> 00:29:48,022
I got here as soon as I could.
Two pensioners?

506
00:29:48,023 --> 00:29:50,422
Are you the key holder, sir?
One of them.

507
00:29:50,423 --> 00:29:53,862
I can open up for you,
you're more than welcome,
but we weren't open yesterday.

508
00:29:53,863 --> 00:29:56,822
We don't open on a Monday.
We've had no visitors since Sunday.

509
00:29:56,823 --> 00:30:00,982
Can I ask, has either of them
been depressed at all lately?

510
00:30:00,983 --> 00:30:03,142
No! Not at all!

511
00:30:03,143 --> 00:30:06,182
Completely the opposite!
They're in love with each other.

512
00:30:06,183 --> 00:30:07,743
They've never been happier!

513
00:30:23,023 --> 00:30:25,462
Right, that's it.
Summat weird's happening.

514
00:30:25,463 --> 00:30:28,142
Why's the car there and them
not in it?

515
00:30:28,143 --> 00:30:31,342
And asking me if either of them
has been depressed lately?

516
00:30:31,343 --> 00:30:35,302
They're just trying to rule things
out, Gillian. It's routine.

517
00:30:35,303 --> 00:30:37,902
They're just trying to
think of the best way forward.

518
00:30:37,903 --> 00:30:41,262
There's nothing sinister about it.
He doesn't know 'em like you do.

519
00:30:41,263 --> 00:30:44,822
He's just trying to build up
a picture. He's just doing his job.

520
00:30:44,823 --> 00:30:47,262
Do you want to drive over there?
I wouldn't.

521
00:30:47,263 --> 00:30:49,742
Honestly,
you're best off here, in t'warm.

522
00:30:49,743 --> 00:30:52,902
You're only going to wind yourselves
up even more if you go over there.

523
00:30:52,903 --> 00:30:55,543
Let them get on with it.
They know what they're doing.

524
00:30:56,543 --> 00:31:00,702
Look, stuff like this happens...
every week.

525
00:31:00,703 --> 00:31:02,702
It's not unusual.

526
00:31:02,703 --> 00:31:05,302
Nine times out of ten,
there's a perfectly...

527
00:31:05,303 --> 00:31:10,422
Well, not necessarily
a rational explanation,
but there's an explanation.

528
00:31:10,423 --> 00:31:14,943
People turn up right as rain.
They're often embarrassed
there's been such a fuss!

529
00:31:15,943 --> 00:31:18,502
I just hope he's warm somewhere.

530
00:31:18,503 --> 00:31:21,863
Not out in this.
Why don't I go over there?

531
00:31:22,903 --> 00:31:26,142
I might find summat out.
And I can keep you up to date better.

532
00:31:26,143 --> 00:31:27,663
Do you want to?

533
00:31:28,703 --> 00:31:29,983
Yeah.

534
00:32:28,423 --> 00:32:31,423
It's very nice,
waking up to this every morning.

535
00:32:32,543 --> 00:32:34,542
Well, yeah.

536
00:32:34,543 --> 00:32:36,143
In summer.

537
00:32:37,463 --> 00:32:38,743
Me dad...

538
00:32:40,463 --> 00:32:45,262
was saying, how would you feel
if Celia came to live with us here?

539
00:32:45,263 --> 00:32:49,262
He was just speculating. I don't
think they've made a decision.

540
00:32:49,263 --> 00:32:53,942
And I said I'd be delighted,
but I don't know how she'd go on
in winter.

541
00:32:53,943 --> 00:32:56,662
Wind can knock you over.

542
00:32:56,663 --> 00:32:59,343
We had eight-foot snowdrifts
last year.

543
00:33:00,783 --> 00:33:04,423
No, I can't quite picture her
milking cows.

544
00:33:06,343 --> 00:33:08,542
I don't have any cows.

545
00:33:08,543 --> 00:33:09,783
Just sheep.

546
00:33:12,903 --> 00:33:15,342
I always wanted a farm.

547
00:33:15,343 --> 00:33:18,143
I don't know why.
I wasn't born into it.

548
00:33:20,423 --> 00:33:22,863
Was your husband? God, no!

549
00:33:24,223 --> 00:33:28,342
Biking and boozing
were his two big career choices.

550
00:33:28,343 --> 00:33:31,903
It was me that did all the wheeling
and dealing and finding out.

551
00:33:33,423 --> 00:33:36,583
He liked it. Well, he loved it.
But...

552
00:33:38,183 --> 00:33:39,422
Where is he?

553
00:33:39,423 --> 00:33:41,302
Dead.

554
00:33:41,303 --> 00:33:43,342
Ten years, this next time.

555
00:33:43,343 --> 00:33:45,103
What happened?

556
00:33:46,423 --> 00:33:48,502
Smashed his skull
with a log splitter.

557
00:33:48,503 --> 00:33:50,503
Oh! In t'barn.

558
00:33:51,783 --> 00:33:52,862
Jesus.

559
00:33:52,863 --> 00:33:55,023
Bled to death.

560
00:33:56,303 --> 00:33:58,742
Which was just as well.

561
00:33:58,743 --> 00:34:01,343
He'd have had brain damage
if he'd survived.

562
00:34:03,063 --> 00:34:06,263
I found him. That was pleasant!

563
00:34:07,383 --> 00:34:08,943
Was it an accident?

564
00:34:10,583 --> 00:34:11,623
No.

565
00:34:14,703 --> 00:34:16,542
Oh, eh.

566
00:34:16,543 --> 00:34:18,383
Sorry.

567
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:22,023
Do you think they're dead? No.

568
00:34:24,303 --> 00:34:27,143
No, I don't think
we should assume that.

569
00:34:28,423 --> 00:34:31,822
He loves her, you know. So much.

570
00:34:31,823 --> 00:34:34,343
He's... It's beautiful.

571
00:34:35,903 --> 00:34:37,863
It's extraordinary.

572
00:34:42,703 --> 00:34:47,422
Whatever has happened,
he'll be looking after her.

573
00:34:47,423 --> 00:34:48,823
I know that.

574
00:34:49,863 --> 00:34:51,663
I know.

575
00:34:55,103 --> 00:34:56,503
It's bothered me, though.

576
00:34:58,623 --> 00:35:01,222
That thing about me mother...

577
00:35:01,223 --> 00:35:03,582
not passing on that message to him.

578
00:35:03,583 --> 00:35:05,183
From your mum.

579
00:35:08,503 --> 00:35:10,343
Because, you know, I suppose...

580
00:35:11,623 --> 00:35:15,743
you want to be able to think
that she'd have been happy for him.

581
00:35:17,143 --> 00:35:19,423
Meeting up with Celia
after all this time.

582
00:35:20,983 --> 00:35:22,663
He's been so...

583
00:35:24,983 --> 00:35:26,703
happy.

584
00:35:29,863 --> 00:35:32,823
But maybe she wouldn't have been.

585
00:35:34,823 --> 00:35:38,022
She were jealous enough to stop 'em
getting together in t'first place.

586
00:35:38,023 --> 00:35:40,302
Maybe she'd have been really...!

587
00:35:40,303 --> 00:35:43,143
She was a teenager
when she did that.

588
00:35:44,663 --> 00:35:48,262
She was the same age Raff is now -
nobody can hold that against her.

589
00:35:48,263 --> 00:35:49,543
But she deceived him...

590
00:35:51,143 --> 00:35:53,343
all their lives.

591
00:35:54,543 --> 00:35:56,462
And he's only just found out.

592
00:35:56,463 --> 00:35:58,303
And I think it's upset him.

593
00:36:00,183 --> 00:36:02,983
He hasn't said owt. No.

594
00:36:04,223 --> 00:36:08,782
If your dad hadn't married your mum,
and my mum hadn't married my dad,

595
00:36:08,783 --> 00:36:11,982
neither of us would be here, so...
Or we could've been sisters.

596
00:36:11,983 --> 00:36:15,063
Yeah, well that would have
been a... Disaster.

597
00:36:16,623 --> 00:36:20,663
I think we should be very grateful
to your mum on the quiet
for doing what she did.

598
00:36:21,703 --> 00:36:23,182
Yeah.

599
00:36:23,183 --> 00:36:25,663
Your parents were happy,
weren't they? Yeah, yeah!

600
00:36:25,664 --> 00:36:26,982
Well, then!

601
00:36:26,983 --> 00:36:28,983
They always seemed to be.

602
00:36:29,983 --> 00:36:31,103
Weren't yours?

603
00:36:32,223 --> 00:36:33,982
Well...

604
00:36:33,983 --> 00:36:36,302
that's what's so odd.

605
00:36:36,303 --> 00:36:40,583
She's suddenly such a different
person to the one I've known
for the last 45 years.

606
00:36:42,463 --> 00:36:46,623
It's suddenly like she's alive,
like I've never seen her before.

607
00:37:02,023 --> 00:37:05,263
Celia? Celia!

608
00:37:07,023 --> 00:37:08,902
Oh, I've been asleep.

609
00:37:08,903 --> 00:37:09,943
Ssh! Ssh!

610
00:37:12,823 --> 00:37:14,422
What time is it?

611
00:37:14,423 --> 00:37:16,622
Oh, it's twenty to eight!

612
00:37:16,623 --> 00:37:18,662
Oh, it's never!

613
00:37:18,663 --> 00:37:20,542
It is!

614
00:37:20,543 --> 00:37:23,382
Oh! Ooh, I'm stiff!

615
00:37:23,383 --> 00:37:24,702
Yeah.

616
00:37:24,703 --> 00:37:26,502
Come on.

617
00:37:26,503 --> 00:37:29,262
Are you all right? Yeah.

618
00:37:29,263 --> 00:37:31,102
I think so.

619
00:37:31,103 --> 00:37:32,622
Are you?

620
00:37:32,623 --> 00:37:35,383
Oh, I've no idea!

621
00:37:40,823 --> 00:37:45,383
I'm sure I shut that door
before we got back into bed.

622
00:37:47,983 --> 00:37:50,503
Oh, let's get out of here.

623
00:37:54,823 --> 00:37:57,582
I'm not optimistic.
Both in their 70s,

624
00:37:57,583 --> 00:37:59,183
out all night. Hello!

625
00:38:00,303 --> 00:38:02,462
We've been shut in!
Are you in charge?

626
00:38:02,463 --> 00:38:05,982
I, er...
We took some chocolate, we had to.

627
00:38:05,983 --> 00:38:08,262
I've left a £5 note by the till.

628
00:38:08,263 --> 00:38:10,542
Are you all right?
And I made the bed.

629
00:38:10,543 --> 00:38:12,983
You should have rung for help.
We couldn't make it work!

630
00:38:12,984 --> 00:38:16,142
And you can't get a signal on
t'mobile! You've to ring 9
for an outside line.

631
00:38:16,143 --> 00:38:19,422
Well, you should have it written
by the phone on a bit of card,

632
00:38:19,423 --> 00:38:21,622
then folk would know.
We weren't open yesterday.

633
00:38:21,623 --> 00:38:24,582
That door was. We had a delivery...

634
00:38:24,583 --> 00:38:27,702
About half past fourish? Oh, my God!

635
00:38:27,703 --> 00:38:29,702
We waited to buy tickets.

636
00:38:29,703 --> 00:38:32,982
Only nobody came, so we wandered
through there, looking for somebody.

637
00:38:32,983 --> 00:38:35,662
Yeah, and then we heard
the door slam. And that was that.

638
00:38:35,663 --> 00:38:38,463
I'm amazed we didn't
set t'alarm off.

639
00:38:40,743 --> 00:38:42,782
Oh, bloody hell.

640
00:38:42,783 --> 00:38:45,622
You couldn't get us an outside line
right now, could you?

641
00:38:45,623 --> 00:38:48,502
Only there'll be people
wondering where the heck we are!

642
00:38:48,503 --> 00:38:49,783
Yeah. There are.

643
00:38:49,784 --> 00:38:52,383
Half of West Yorkshire Police
are out looking for you!

644
00:38:56,583 --> 00:38:58,862
'What are you going to do
about work?'

645
00:38:58,863 --> 00:39:03,742
I've spoken to the deputy heads.
They can keep things afloat without
me for as long as, um...

646
00:39:03,743 --> 00:39:05,822
I thought we'd know something
by now.

647
00:39:05,823 --> 00:39:08,582
How are the boys?
I'm not sending Lawrence to school.

648
00:39:08,583 --> 00:39:12,182
William's not got any exams today
anyway, but neither of them
slept a wink.

649
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:14,382
'Well, none of us have.' It's fine.

650
00:39:14,383 --> 00:39:16,822
Fine.

651
00:39:16,823 --> 00:39:18,982
Hello! Granddad!

652
00:39:18,983 --> 00:39:20,182
Oh, my God!

653
00:39:20,183 --> 00:39:21,423
Are you both all right?

654
00:39:21,424 --> 00:39:25,582
Mrs... Dr? Caroline's here.
She's been here all night with...

655
00:39:25,583 --> 00:39:28,263
Can I talk to her?
She wants to talk to Celia.

656
00:39:29,503 --> 00:39:30,662
Mum?

657
00:39:30,663 --> 00:39:33,222
Gillian! Mum!

658
00:39:33,223 --> 00:39:36,062
Gillian! Gillian!

659
00:39:36,063 --> 00:39:39,462
They're fine. They're fine!
They're absolutely fine.

660
00:39:39,463 --> 00:39:41,303
They got shut inside
Southowram Hall.

661
00:39:41,304 --> 00:39:43,822
They've been playing cards
and eating chocolate!

662
00:39:43,823 --> 00:39:44,983
Shut in?! Yeah!

663
00:39:44,984 --> 00:39:47,263
Didn't t'police think
to look in there first?!

664
00:39:51,623 --> 00:39:54,102
Oh, I'll kill him!

665
00:39:54,103 --> 00:39:55,662
Dozy...!

666
00:39:55,663 --> 00:40:01,183
Only he could go getting himself
in a...!

667
00:40:03,383 --> 00:40:05,343
Oh!

668
00:40:22,703 --> 00:40:24,782
OK, so, school.

669
00:40:24,783 --> 00:40:28,382
Mum says you don't have to go,
so I suggest bed, day off,
Xbox, possibly.

670
00:40:28,383 --> 00:40:30,862
Yes!
Go for it. Not you, obviously.

671
00:40:30,863 --> 00:40:32,542
You have to revise.

672
00:40:32,543 --> 00:40:35,543
I, sadly, have to go to
the supermarket.

673
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:49,142
You'll be better off upstairs,
out of t'way.

674
00:40:49,143 --> 00:40:51,342
Where will you sleep? On t'settee.

675
00:40:51,343 --> 00:40:55,742
I'll hide your car in t'barn, then
if anybody comes looking for you...

676
00:40:55,743 --> 00:40:57,503
No, no, no.

677
00:40:58,983 --> 00:41:00,822
I'll tell 'em you're not here.

678
00:41:00,823 --> 00:41:03,183
OK?

679
00:41:10,503 --> 00:41:11,863
OK.

680
00:41:13,783 --> 00:41:15,262
Right...

681
00:41:15,263 --> 00:41:19,102
you... keep it quiet till I've had
a chance to explain to me dad

682
00:41:19,103 --> 00:41:21,782
what the bloody hell
you're doing here.

683
00:41:21,783 --> 00:41:23,662
Then... Ow!

684
00:41:23,663 --> 00:41:27,622
When I have, I don't want
any vulgar comments

685
00:41:27,623 --> 00:41:30,182
of any description
in front of Celia!

686
00:41:30,183 --> 00:41:32,462
Is that absolutely understood?

687
00:41:32,463 --> 00:41:36,382
Cos you'll be out on your arse
if you do, faster than you can say
"compound fracture".

688
00:41:36,383 --> 00:41:39,502
Now, is there anything I've said
you're having trouble with?

689
00:41:39,503 --> 00:41:43,103
Have you got me painkillers?

690
00:41:44,383 --> 00:41:46,782
I'll get you some water.

691
00:41:46,783 --> 00:41:50,142
I wish I'd have thought
to stick him in here sooner.

692
00:41:50,143 --> 00:41:51,543
Mum, they're here!

693
00:41:59,783 --> 00:42:02,502
What happened?! Oh!

694
00:42:02,503 --> 00:42:05,183
Shouldn't you be at work? Yes.

695
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:10,702
Hey, whose car is that? We had
a full house last night trying to
work out where the hell you were.

696
00:42:10,703 --> 00:42:12,662
Hey! Is that our Land Rover?!

697
00:42:12,663 --> 00:42:13,943
It was hit by lightning.

698
00:42:13,944 --> 00:42:17,502
Are you all right?
Stiff, cold and muzzy-headed.

699
00:42:17,503 --> 00:42:20,502
I hope the police gave whoever
locked you in a rocket up their...

700
00:42:20,503 --> 00:42:22,262
Oh, that's guaranteed.

701
00:42:22,263 --> 00:42:24,982
We thought you'd eloped!
Eh, that's a good idea.

702
00:42:24,983 --> 00:42:27,182
Are you hungry?

703
00:42:27,183 --> 00:42:30,062
Oh, a nice cup of tea with a bit of
sugar, I think.

704
00:42:30,063 --> 00:42:32,902
Oh, we can do tea!
And he needs his pills!

705
00:42:32,903 --> 00:42:34,743
Hey, whose car did you say that were?

706
00:42:34,744 --> 00:42:37,902
Oh, it's, um... It's Paul Jatri's.

707
00:42:37,903 --> 00:42:39,942
Paul Jatri? Yeah!

708
00:42:39,943 --> 00:42:42,982
Yeah, he's... I'll get t'kettle on.

709
00:42:42,983 --> 00:42:44,263
How do you feel?

710
00:42:44,264 --> 00:42:47,343
Oh, like puke warmed up,
to quote our Lawrence.

711
00:42:53,903 --> 00:42:55,862
Hi. Ah.

712
00:42:55,863 --> 00:42:57,703
Sorry about this.

713
00:43:02,343 --> 00:43:03,423
Two months' rent.

714
00:43:03,424 --> 00:43:06,623
You really are very kind.

715
00:43:07,943 --> 00:43:10,662
John? Are you all right?

716
00:43:10,663 --> 00:43:13,582
Oh, didn't get much sleep last night.

717
00:43:13,583 --> 00:43:17,462
God, I didn't mean for you to get
panicky! I'm not blackmailing you!

718
00:43:17,463 --> 00:43:20,182
My mother-in-law went missing. Oh.

719
00:43:20,183 --> 00:43:21,782
Is she...? Fine. She's fine.

720
00:43:21,783 --> 00:43:23,262
She's absolutely fine.

721
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:26,582
Oh, well, that's... good.

722
00:43:26,583 --> 00:43:31,662
I was thinking of asking Tim Hoskins
if I could have my old job back

723
00:43:31,663 --> 00:43:33,103
at the university library.

724
00:43:33,104 --> 00:43:35,662
Judith, it was Tim Hoskins
who asked you to leave.

725
00:43:35,663 --> 00:43:41,382
Yes, I know, but I thought,
if you could put a word in for me,

726
00:43:41,383 --> 00:43:43,542
if you told him
that I'm getting better

727
00:43:43,543 --> 00:43:45,302
and I'm dealing with it and...

728
00:43:45,303 --> 00:43:46,983
I imagine he's replaced you by now.

729
00:43:46,984 --> 00:43:49,222
Yes, but next time
there's a vacancy.

730
00:43:49,223 --> 00:43:50,982
Judith, no!

731
00:43:50,983 --> 00:43:54,382
I'm going to tell Caroline I've
given you that money, all right?

732
00:43:54,383 --> 00:43:58,142
And please, don't ask me for any
more. I think as regards employment,

733
00:43:58,143 --> 00:44:02,783
you're going to have to set your
sights on something more realistic.
For "realistic", read "menial"?!

734
00:44:04,623 --> 00:44:08,942
You WERE going to introduce me
to your publisher! Have you got
anything finished to show him?

735
00:44:08,943 --> 00:44:11,062
I've written another chapter,
that's four!

736
00:44:11,063 --> 00:44:15,543
Judith, I've explained this.
No-one's going to publish
a few chapters. I know that!

737
00:44:17,103 --> 00:44:20,222
And no-one's going to advance you
some money on the strength of them.

738
00:44:20,223 --> 00:44:22,262
Again, we come back
to living in the real world!

739
00:44:22,263 --> 00:44:23,862
Oh, you're a patronising...!

740
00:44:23,863 --> 00:44:26,102
No, Judith, I'm telling it to you
like it is.

741
00:44:26,103 --> 00:44:27,703
It's possibly time someone did.

742
00:44:28,743 --> 00:44:32,462
You used to say I had a potential
as a novelist. Yes, I did!

743
00:44:32,463 --> 00:44:33,983
You still have to put the hours in!

744
00:44:33,984 --> 00:44:37,742
You still have to stay sober
long enough to actually get it down
in black and white!

745
00:44:37,743 --> 00:44:41,702
You can't make a career and a living
out of potential!

746
00:44:41,703 --> 00:44:44,142
You've got to take it
to the next level.

747
00:44:44,143 --> 00:44:48,502
If you ever understand what I'm
saying, and simply got on with it,
you'd probably thank me in the end.

748
00:44:48,503 --> 00:44:49,623
As it is... Piss off!

749
00:44:49,624 --> 00:44:51,183
Exactly.

750
00:44:52,303 --> 00:44:56,822
If... If I ever did think you were
genuinely making an effort, I hope...

751
00:44:56,823 --> 00:44:59,182
I HOPE - I would help you.

752
00:44:59,183 --> 00:45:01,263
As it is, that's it now.

753
00:45:16,343 --> 00:45:17,662
We should sue!

754
00:45:17,663 --> 00:45:20,582
I mean, you lot have been worried
out of your minds.

755
00:45:20,583 --> 00:45:24,342
Me and Alan's traumatised.
It's negligence!

756
00:45:24,343 --> 00:45:27,862
But they've offered you the venue
free of charge for the wedding?

757
00:45:27,863 --> 00:45:31,902
Mm-hm. Well, you can't accept that
and sue them, can you?

758
00:45:31,903 --> 00:45:34,502
Well, no.

759
00:45:34,503 --> 00:45:36,543
And it is very classy.

760
00:45:38,503 --> 00:45:42,062
There can't be so many can afford
to get married there.

761
00:45:42,063 --> 00:45:44,662
And it would be one in the eye
for the church!

762
00:45:44,663 --> 00:45:46,982
We got turned down! Did I tell you?

763
00:45:46,983 --> 00:45:49,182
I mean, can you believe it?!

764
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:53,942
The hours me and Alan have sat
suffering in that church
when we were kids.

765
00:45:53,943 --> 00:45:57,063
And now we don't even qualify
to get wed in it!

766
00:45:58,103 --> 00:45:59,543
It's criminal!

767
00:46:03,743 --> 00:46:06,942
You've been having a fling
with Paul Jatri?!

768
00:46:06,943 --> 00:46:10,382
Can you believe it?
Oh, he's only 15!

769
00:46:10,383 --> 00:46:14,142
No, Dad, that would be illegal.
He's 22.

770
00:46:14,143 --> 00:46:16,982
Yeah, and you're 45!
Have you looked in t'mirror lately?

771
00:46:16,983 --> 00:46:19,982
It wasn't a fling! It was just...

772
00:46:19,983 --> 00:46:23,342
It's not funny. It's a mess! That's
why clever beggar got arrested!

773
00:46:23,343 --> 00:46:26,422
And then Paul's girlfriend
got wind of it and...

774
00:46:26,423 --> 00:46:28,022
He's got a girlfriend?!

775
00:46:28,023 --> 00:46:30,142
He's engaged to Neil Creswell's lass!

776
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:33,462
Her brothers have done him over
even worse! A hell of a lot worse!

777
00:46:33,463 --> 00:46:35,262
Then there's my Land...

778
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:37,342
That's why he's upstairs in my bed

779
00:46:37,343 --> 00:46:40,342
with a broken leg, a bust jaw,
three cracked ribs

780
00:46:40,343 --> 00:46:43,943
and the fingers on one hand
all smashed to... buggery!

781
00:46:45,303 --> 00:46:48,142
Can you believe it?
He's got nowhere else to go!

782
00:46:48,143 --> 00:46:49,662
You always did pick 'em!

783
00:46:49,663 --> 00:46:52,462
I've made it clear to him,
he hasn't...

784
00:46:52,463 --> 00:46:56,742
to do or say anything crude
or provocative in front of Celia,

785
00:46:56,743 --> 00:46:58,742
which I don't think he will.

786
00:46:58,743 --> 00:47:01,742
He's not capable at the minute.
Oh, it's your house.

787
00:47:01,743 --> 00:47:04,382
Don't say that, Granddad!
Tell her to chuck him out!

788
00:47:04,383 --> 00:47:06,343
You're not really stopping
with Robbie?

789
00:47:06,344 --> 00:47:09,822
Well... well, why would I want
to be here?

790
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:14,022
I don't mind her having a boyfriend,
but why can't she pick somebody
who A - isn't a dickhead,

791
00:47:14,023 --> 00:47:19,382
B - isn't 300 years younger than
she is, and C - wasn't engaged
to somebody else!

792
00:47:19,383 --> 00:47:22,142
So I'm not perfect!
I'm amazed this is news to you!

793
00:47:22,143 --> 00:47:25,343
Have I ever claimed to be?!

794
00:47:29,703 --> 00:47:31,182
Oh!

795
00:47:31,183 --> 00:47:34,142
Fella that's engaged!

796
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:36,823
Yes! All right! So crucify me!

797
00:47:38,223 --> 00:47:40,543
Are you all right?

798
00:47:42,143 --> 00:47:46,463
I might pop down to t'surgery
in the next few days.

799
00:47:47,863 --> 00:47:51,102
Make a little appointment,
just have a little check-up.

800
00:47:51,103 --> 00:47:53,742
Are you...? No, it's nowt...

801
00:47:53,743 --> 00:47:55,102
It's a twinge.

802
00:47:55,103 --> 00:47:57,702
Once or twice last night.
I'll ring up now.

803
00:47:57,703 --> 00:48:01,342
No, no, I'll ring. I'll ring.
I'll... wait, while it's quieter.

804
00:48:01,343 --> 00:48:03,702
Dad. It's nowt.

805
00:48:03,703 --> 00:48:05,382
It's... It's stress.

806
00:48:05,383 --> 00:48:09,142
Last night, it was stressful.

807
00:48:09,143 --> 00:48:11,223
I'm fine. I am.

808
00:48:12,543 --> 00:48:13,902
I've never been happier!

809
00:48:13,903 --> 00:48:17,662
That's better than any medicine.

810
00:48:17,663 --> 00:48:20,302
You didn't have your pills on you
last night, did you?

811
00:48:20,303 --> 00:48:25,942
No... but I've taken them now.
When will you learn? You've got to
take them with you, wherever you go.

812
00:48:25,943 --> 00:48:28,822
Especially now with all of these...
shenanigans

813
00:48:28,823 --> 00:48:31,822
you've started getting into...
Up to. Right, well, I will.

814
00:48:31,823 --> 00:48:33,662
Promise me. I promise.

815
00:48:33,663 --> 00:48:36,502
And bugger popping down in t'next
few days. You're ringing now,

816
00:48:36,503 --> 00:48:38,383
as soon as everyone's gone.
All right.

817
00:48:38,384 --> 00:48:40,382
No. Right, as in...?

818
00:48:40,383 --> 00:48:42,622
Yes, right as in right.

819
00:48:42,623 --> 00:48:44,022
Sorry to interrupt.

820
00:48:44,023 --> 00:48:48,662
I'm going to get off. I ought to try
and get into work this afternoon.

821
00:48:48,663 --> 00:48:52,782
I'll look after 'em.
You take care of yourself.

822
00:48:52,783 --> 00:48:55,743
Yeah, I will. And you.

823
00:49:03,263 --> 00:49:05,222
Don't be depressed.

824
00:49:05,223 --> 00:49:06,582
It's a waste of time.

825
00:49:06,583 --> 00:49:08,743
Just move on.

826
00:49:09,783 --> 00:49:12,503
It's easier said than done, I know.

827
00:49:13,583 --> 00:49:16,863
Good luck with, um...
Yeah, well. We'll see.

828
00:49:23,543 --> 00:49:24,623
Drive safely!

829
00:49:35,823 --> 00:49:38,623
I'll drop him off at school.
Will you be able to stay awake?

830
00:49:43,623 --> 00:49:45,503
Thank you... Robbie.

831
00:51:21,503 --> 00:51:25,062
I'm running you a nice, hot bath.
Oh!

832
00:51:25,063 --> 00:51:27,102
I put you some bubbles in.

833
00:51:27,103 --> 00:51:28,622
Aw. Do you like bubbles?

834
00:51:28,623 --> 00:51:30,902
I love bubbles.
It'll warm you through.

835
00:51:30,903 --> 00:51:32,742
It will.

836
00:51:32,743 --> 00:51:35,742
Well, I say a nice hot bath -
it generally takes half an hour
to fill,

837
00:51:35,743 --> 00:51:38,182
by which time, it's slightly cooler,
but...

838
00:51:38,183 --> 00:51:39,622
It'll be lovely.

839
00:51:39,623 --> 00:51:42,022
And we've got plenty towels.

840
00:51:42,023 --> 00:51:44,582
Good.
I've put you two over t'radiator

841
00:51:44,583 --> 00:51:47,222
and I've set you up a little radio
next to t'bath.

842
00:51:47,223 --> 00:51:49,102
I'll put it on Radio 2.

843
00:51:49,103 --> 00:51:51,062
It is Radio 2 you like?

844
00:51:51,063 --> 00:51:52,703
I love Radio 2!

845
00:51:54,103 --> 00:51:55,862
Can I make you some more tea?

846
00:51:55,863 --> 00:51:58,982
No! I'm all tea-ed out.

847
00:51:58,983 --> 00:52:01,182
I'll make you a nice pot of coffee!

848
00:52:01,183 --> 00:52:04,502
Then you can step out of the bath
and have a cup of hot coffee!

849
00:52:04,503 --> 00:52:07,382
You're spoiling me.

850
00:52:07,383 --> 00:52:09,662
Yeah, well...

851
00:52:09,663 --> 00:52:11,462
that's t'plan.

852
00:52:11,463 --> 00:52:13,782
So you'd better get used to it...

853
00:52:13,783 --> 00:52:15,383
Mrs Buttershaw!

854
00:52:16,463 --> 00:52:20,503
Because that's the way
it's going to be from now on!

855
00:52:27,463 --> 00:52:28,543
Right.

856
00:52:49,263 --> 00:52:51,022
Hi.

857
00:52:51,023 --> 00:52:53,662
Hi. You must be exhausted.

858
00:52:53,663 --> 00:52:56,062
Did you send the boys to school?

859
00:52:56,063 --> 00:52:58,862
No, they're both asleep
in front of the telly. How's Celia?

860
00:52:58,863 --> 00:53:00,342
Fine!

861
00:53:00,343 --> 00:53:02,462
A bit - I don't know - wobbly.

862
00:53:02,463 --> 00:53:03,983
Shock, probably.

863
00:53:05,543 --> 00:53:07,702
She wanted to stay over there, so...

864
00:53:07,703 --> 00:53:09,862
It's a weird thing to happen.

865
00:53:09,863 --> 00:53:11,822
Can I make you some coffee?

866
00:53:11,823 --> 00:53:12,983
Um...

867
00:53:16,863 --> 00:53:18,422
No, thank you.

868
00:53:18,423 --> 00:53:23,582
I'm going to go to sleep for a bit,
then I might... try and go into work.

869
00:53:23,583 --> 00:53:26,542
Oh, surely no-one's going
to expect you in today.

870
00:53:26,543 --> 00:53:28,982
Could I...? What?

871
00:53:28,983 --> 00:53:31,422
I wanted to say something,
tell you something.

872
00:53:31,423 --> 00:53:33,143
What?

873
00:53:49,063 --> 00:53:50,943
I hate what's gone wrong between us.

874
00:53:50,944 --> 00:53:53,382
I don't know if you're ever going
to forgive me,

875
00:53:53,383 --> 00:53:57,742
but I made this deal with myself
that I would never lie to you
ever again.

876
00:53:57,743 --> 00:54:00,742
Or deceive you
in any way, shape or form,

877
00:54:00,743 --> 00:54:05,422
in the hope that one day,
you would possibly...

878
00:54:05,423 --> 00:54:09,702
So, I want you to know that
purely because I felt responsible,

879
00:54:09,703 --> 00:54:12,582
guilty, God knows...

880
00:54:12,583 --> 00:54:14,302
sorry for her,

881
00:54:14,303 --> 00:54:18,902
because she's so... pathetic, I lent...

882
00:54:18,903 --> 00:54:23,302
gave - Judith some money
for her rent.

883
00:54:23,303 --> 00:54:27,062
When?! This morning,
but I've made it clear to her
there's no more where that came from.

884
00:54:27,063 --> 00:54:30,982
And - and - I've told her
that I'd be telling you all about it.

885
00:54:30,983 --> 00:54:34,222
She rang up begging,

886
00:54:34,223 --> 00:54:35,702
begging!

887
00:54:35,703 --> 00:54:40,862
She's got almost no...
grasp on the realities of life.

888
00:54:40,863 --> 00:54:42,862
Aww. Poor bitch.

889
00:54:42,863 --> 00:54:44,543
I wish she didn't exist.

890
00:54:46,063 --> 00:54:49,582
Which is a terrible thing
to say about someone.

891
00:54:49,583 --> 00:54:53,462
I've been thinking. Yeah?

892
00:54:53,463 --> 00:54:58,382
This can work here. We can be civil,
can't we, for the boys?

893
00:54:58,383 --> 00:55:00,742
And like you said,
there's room for everyone.

894
00:55:00,743 --> 00:55:03,662
Sure. So?

895
00:55:03,663 --> 00:55:06,103
I'm seeing someone.

896
00:55:07,143 --> 00:55:09,342
Y-Y-Y... Mmm.

897
00:55:09,343 --> 00:55:10,942
You are? Mmm.

898
00:55:10,943 --> 00:55:12,662
You? Who?

899
00:55:12,663 --> 00:55:14,782
When? It's not...

900
00:55:14,783 --> 00:55:18,583
I don't know if it's
what I want entirely yet, but...

901
00:55:21,823 --> 00:55:23,942
I won't know if I don't try.

902
00:55:23,943 --> 00:55:25,462
Who?

903
00:55:25,463 --> 00:55:26,862
Someone. Who?!

904
00:55:26,863 --> 00:55:28,542
It doesn't matter! Matters to me!

905
00:55:28,543 --> 00:55:32,102
I'm not going to tell you
who it is, John, so...

906
00:55:32,103 --> 00:55:34,342
Someone at work?
Possibly. Possibly not.

907
00:55:34,343 --> 00:55:35,902
It is! You may think that.

908
00:55:35,903 --> 00:55:37,622
I couldn't possibly comment.

909
00:55:37,623 --> 00:55:39,062
Who? I'm going to bed.

910
00:55:39,063 --> 00:55:41,542
Who?! John! Who?!
That's the deal!

911
00:55:41,543 --> 00:55:43,703
Hang on, I'm not living
under the same roof as you

912
00:55:43,704 --> 00:55:45,822
while you're having it off
with someone else!

913
00:55:45,823 --> 00:55:48,022
Well, you know where the door is.

914
00:55:48,023 --> 00:55:49,861
Are you lying, Caroline?
Are you lying?!

915
00:55:49,862 --> 00:55:51,661
I don't do lies!
Well, who is it then?!

916
00:55:51,662 --> 00:55:53,143
No-one! Why's it a secret?!

917
00:55:53,144 --> 00:55:56,622
Because I don't want to have to
listen to any of your opinions

918
00:55:56,623 --> 00:55:59,742
and comments and
inane bloody rubbish.

919
00:55:59,743 --> 00:56:01,021
So it's someone I know!

920
00:56:01,022 --> 00:56:02,183
Maybe, maybe not!

921
00:56:02,184 --> 00:56:04,262
What's going on?! Nothing.

922
00:56:04,263 --> 00:56:06,022
Hi, kids!

923
00:56:06,023 --> 00:56:08,582
What's up?

924
00:56:08,583 --> 00:56:09,782
She's... What?

925
00:56:09,783 --> 00:56:10,863
Seeing someone.

926
00:56:10,864 --> 00:56:12,702
Mum? Yes.

927
00:56:12,703 --> 00:56:14,782
Mum?! Yes!

928
00:56:14,783 --> 00:56:17,343
Who? Some... I don't know!

929
00:56:18,543 --> 00:56:21,583
Does she bother with anyone
in particular at school?

930
00:56:29,343 --> 00:56:33,022
No. Don't be stupid!

931
00:56:33,023 --> 00:56:34,983
Caroline!

932
00:56:37,543 --> 00:56:38,862
Caroline!

933
00:56:38,863 --> 00:56:40,822
Caroline!

934
00:56:40,823 --> 00:56:42,423
Come on! Open the door!

935
00:56:43,423 --> 00:56:46,302
Where've you been? Where haven't I?
You're not moving him in here.

936
00:56:46,303 --> 00:56:48,182
I'm glad we... talked.

937
00:56:48,183 --> 00:56:50,143
Do you fancy going out
for a meal some time?

938
00:56:50,144 --> 00:56:52,703
- Keep having adventures!
- We're up Soyland!

939
00:56:54,023 --> 00:56:55,063
I've been used.

940
00:56:55,064 --> 00:56:57,822
Judith? Yeah. Mind where you're...

941
00:56:57,823 --> 00:57:01,022
to the back teeth of him.
You're not leaving him here!

942
00:57:01,023 --> 00:57:02,542
It's your fault he's in this mess.

943
00:57:02,543 --> 00:57:04,462
Hey! You're not dead, then.

944
00:57:04,463 --> 00:57:07,583
Have you thought about a best man?
I've never been a best man.

945
00:57:08,703 --> 00:57:10,263
Oh, I haven't a clue where John is.

946
00:57:10,264 --> 00:57:13,063
Celia! Oh, God!
What's happened?!

947
00:57:13,679 --> 00:57:47,329
