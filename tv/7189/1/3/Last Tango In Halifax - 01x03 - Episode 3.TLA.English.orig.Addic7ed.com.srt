1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,302
We're serious about getting married.
Whatever. I sent you a note
to say I couldn't come.

2
00:00:05,509 --> 00:00:07,070
I gave it to Eileen Pickford
to give to you.

3
00:00:07,071 --> 00:00:08,389
Eileen?

4
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:10,949
My mother? Yeah.

5
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:12,870
No, don't tell me you didn't get it?

6
00:00:12,871 --> 00:00:15,309
I'm very... fond of you.

7
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:18,189
I just don't think
I can do this any more.

8
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:19,708
I'm arresting you on suspicion of
assault.

9
00:00:19,776 --> 00:00:20,815
You're not arresting him!

10
00:00:20,816 --> 00:00:22,737
There's summat about you
bending over in a field

11
00:00:22,738 --> 00:00:24,976
that makes me almost
unable to contain myself.

12
00:00:24,977 --> 00:00:26,856
Ow!

13
00:00:26,857 --> 00:00:29,776
Tell me about when my dad died.
It wasn't an accident.
She killed him.

14
00:00:29,777 --> 00:00:32,216
We decided against
an engagement ring,

15
00:00:32,217 --> 00:00:35,416
so instead, we bought
a car between us.

16
00:00:35,417 --> 00:00:37,776
Judith, this is William, my eldest.
Hello.

17
00:00:37,777 --> 00:00:40,456
He's had that bitch in our house.

18
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:42,137
Don't come back.

19
00:00:45,182 --> 00:01:30,648

<font color="#3399CC">http://UKsubtitles.ru.</font>

20
00:01:30,657 --> 00:01:32,816
You can't just leave him. Can't I?

21
00:01:32,817 --> 00:01:34,816
Why not? He left me.

22
00:01:34,817 --> 00:01:37,536
I mean, you can't just abandon him
in the middle of nowhere.

23
00:01:37,537 --> 00:01:40,296
You think I should let him humiliate
me over and over again...

24
00:01:40,297 --> 00:01:45,016
Bend! ..and pretend that
everything's fine and dandy,
when in actual fact

25
00:01:45,017 --> 00:01:46,857
I'm having a nervous bloody
breakdown?

26
00:01:46,858 --> 00:01:48,097
Mum!

27
00:02:00,577 --> 00:02:01,657
Oh.

28
00:02:02,817 --> 00:02:03,857
Are you all right?

29
00:02:05,137 --> 00:02:06,217
Caroline?

30
00:02:21,137 --> 00:02:24,896
Idiot. You're an idiot.

31
00:02:24,897 --> 00:02:27,176
Why am I an idiot? Telling her.

32
00:02:27,177 --> 00:02:29,496
He probably wasn't even
doing anything.

33
00:02:29,497 --> 00:02:31,776
He hates her. He hates Judith.

34
00:02:31,777 --> 00:02:34,337
He was probably
just trying to get rid of her.

35
00:02:44,937 --> 00:02:45,977
Mum.

36
00:02:49,977 --> 00:02:51,536
I'm sorry.

37
00:02:51,537 --> 00:02:53,056
I shouldn't have said anything.

38
00:02:53,057 --> 00:02:54,975
They weren't doing anything.
They were just drunk.

39
00:02:54,976 --> 00:02:56,417
He let her into the house.

40
00:02:57,937 --> 00:03:00,456
It doesn't matter whether
they were doing anything or not.

41
00:03:00,457 --> 00:03:04,457
What matters is that he's shallow
and weak-willed...

42
00:03:05,817 --> 00:03:08,057
and I can't trust him.

43
00:03:09,057 --> 00:03:10,297
Much as I'd like to.

44
00:03:11,937 --> 00:03:12,977
For your sake.

45
00:03:14,257 --> 00:03:16,056
My sake.

46
00:03:16,057 --> 00:03:17,497
Everyone's sake.

47
00:03:30,457 --> 00:03:31,897
Are you all right, Mum?

48
00:03:34,337 --> 00:03:35,777
Are you?

49
00:03:38,897 --> 00:03:40,257
Come on.

50
00:03:54,537 --> 00:03:57,016
I couldn't find a parking space.

51
00:03:57,017 --> 00:03:58,177
What have they said?

52
00:03:59,817 --> 00:04:03,136
Um... they're not pressing charges.
It is just a caution.

53
00:04:03,137 --> 00:04:04,177
Oh.

54
00:04:05,897 --> 00:04:09,776
Here, I know it looks extravagant,
the car.

55
00:04:09,777 --> 00:04:13,617
And, yeah, your mother might have
liked one, but I don't know, I...

56
00:04:15,417 --> 00:04:18,097
She were never bothered about cars.

57
00:04:20,297 --> 00:04:21,337
Odd.

58
00:04:22,537 --> 00:04:27,017
That thing you said about
my mother not giving you that note.

59
00:04:29,777 --> 00:04:32,536
Do you wish she had? Given it to you?

60
00:04:32,537 --> 00:04:34,776
Well, you can't think like that,
can you?

61
00:04:34,777 --> 00:04:36,376
No, but do you?

62
00:04:36,377 --> 00:04:38,896
No! Course not!

63
00:04:38,897 --> 00:04:42,936
But you aren't cross with her,
for not doing?

64
00:04:42,937 --> 00:04:44,097
No.

65
00:04:46,937 --> 00:04:50,496
She was a fantastic woman, my mother.

66
00:04:50,497 --> 00:04:53,216
Yeah, she were. You're right.

67
00:04:53,217 --> 00:04:55,217
I've certainly got no complaints.

68
00:04:58,417 --> 00:05:00,416
Done and dusted.

69
00:05:00,417 --> 00:05:04,016
And next time, give the weedy
little twat a wide berth.

70
00:05:04,017 --> 00:05:05,737
You all right?

71
00:05:09,257 --> 00:05:10,377
What were it about?

72
00:05:12,097 --> 00:05:15,777
Gillian? You know as much as me,
Robbie.

73
00:05:34,657 --> 00:05:38,056
What did he say, the inspector?
Stuff.

74
00:05:38,057 --> 00:05:39,857
I'll see you back there. Right.

75
00:05:41,097 --> 00:05:43,537
And what was Paul Jaktri saying?

76
00:05:44,577 --> 00:05:45,736
Shit.

77
00:05:45,737 --> 00:05:48,137
What kind of shit? Can I go in
t'Lexus with my grandad?

78
00:05:48,138 --> 00:05:50,177
What kind of shit? Grandad,
can I go with you?

79
00:05:53,097 --> 00:05:55,096
You OK?
I'm sorry I spoilt your party.

80
00:05:55,097 --> 00:05:56,137
Ah...

81
00:06:23,937 --> 00:06:25,217
Ah.

82
00:06:27,697 --> 00:06:29,056
I'm going to my room.

83
00:06:29,057 --> 00:06:32,216
I thought I'd better hang about.
You left the door unlocked.

84
00:06:32,217 --> 00:06:34,776
I'll ring Celia, see if she's all
right.

85
00:06:34,777 --> 00:06:36,256
Right. Mm.

86
00:06:36,257 --> 00:06:41,017
How... how were things
at the, um... police station?

87
00:06:43,257 --> 00:06:47,096
I'd hate you and Caroline
to get the wrong idea about us.

88
00:06:47,097 --> 00:06:48,736
For my dad's sake.

89
00:06:48,737 --> 00:06:52,056
This isn't how he behaves, Raffy.
He's a good lad.

90
00:06:52,057 --> 00:06:53,416
I'm sure he is.

91
00:06:53,417 --> 00:06:57,736
God knows why he couldn't rise above
it. He... he would do normally.

92
00:06:57,737 --> 00:07:00,136
Kids. Well, boys, anyway.

93
00:07:00,137 --> 00:07:01,816
I...I helped myself. Good.

94
00:07:01,817 --> 00:07:03,937
I hope that's... Absolutely fine.

95
00:07:06,257 --> 00:07:09,056
Sorry about... What?

96
00:07:09,057 --> 00:07:12,096
Oh, dirty linen in public.
Me and Caroline.

97
00:07:12,097 --> 00:07:15,936
Hey, listen. Don't apologise to me.

98
00:07:15,937 --> 00:07:19,256
Not for anything.
I don't judge people.

99
00:07:19,257 --> 00:07:22,496
Never have done. Life's too short.

100
00:07:22,497 --> 00:07:24,816
Let's be frank.

101
00:07:24,817 --> 00:07:28,097
We're none of us perfect.
The ironic thing is...

102
00:07:29,297 --> 00:07:31,576
What? Oh.

103
00:07:31,577 --> 00:07:34,056
I had this...

104
00:07:34,057 --> 00:07:35,936
fling thing,

105
00:07:35,937 --> 00:07:37,976
affair-fest,

106
00:07:37,977 --> 00:07:40,736
embarrassing mistake thing
with this Judith,

107
00:07:40,737 --> 00:07:43,457
four... three months ago.

108
00:07:44,417 --> 00:07:45,737
Tell me when I get boring.

109
00:07:45,738 --> 00:07:48,256
Oh, the point is she...

110
00:07:48,257 --> 00:07:52,536
I was in the house by myself.
Our house, mine and Caroline's.

111
00:07:52,537 --> 00:07:55,816
And she turns up. Judith.

112
00:07:55,817 --> 00:07:59,576
And I can't get rid of her.
William comes home from school early,

113
00:07:59,577 --> 00:08:01,696
because he's in the middle
of his A levels.

114
00:08:01,697 --> 00:08:04,176
He assumes we're up to stuff.

115
00:08:04,177 --> 00:08:06,456
Which we're not. Absolutely not.
All over.

116
00:08:06,457 --> 00:08:08,576
Thing of the past. Big, bad mistake.

117
00:08:08,577 --> 00:08:13,496
Desperately grateful to be back
with glorious, snotty, mad Caroline,

118
00:08:13,497 --> 00:08:15,017
albeit in the spare bedroom.

119
00:08:16,057 --> 00:08:20,617
But now she's gone all berserk
and says I'm out on my ear again.

120
00:08:22,137 --> 00:08:23,576
Shit.

121
00:08:23,577 --> 00:08:24,617
I've...

122
00:08:26,697 --> 00:08:30,216
just got to pop upstairs
and see if Raffy's OK.

123
00:08:30,217 --> 00:08:32,056
Sure.

124
00:08:32,057 --> 00:08:33,977
Sure.

125
00:08:46,577 --> 00:08:47,617
Raff?

126
00:08:49,577 --> 00:08:53,176
I want to know what Paul was saying
that made you so cross.

127
00:08:53,177 --> 00:08:57,296
He's an idiot. Well, I can't say
I'd argue with you over that.

128
00:08:57,297 --> 00:08:59,537
And you're an idiot as well.

129
00:09:13,057 --> 00:09:15,697
How's the car? Smashing.

130
00:09:16,737 --> 00:09:19,056
You couldn't drive me
to the nearest railway?

131
00:09:19,057 --> 00:09:22,336
Well, where are you heading?
Well, Harrogate.

132
00:09:22,337 --> 00:09:26,016
Well, I'll drive you there.
I'm off over to see Celia.
She's barely seen that car.

133
00:09:26,017 --> 00:09:28,256
But it'll have to be tomorrow
morning.

134
00:09:28,257 --> 00:09:30,256
I'm not setting off now!

135
00:09:30,257 --> 00:09:34,056
It's dark. Fine. Great. Is that...?

136
00:09:34,057 --> 00:09:36,457
So... so could I stay?

137
00:09:38,577 --> 00:09:40,097
Can he stay?

138
00:09:41,177 --> 00:09:45,456
Alan's very kindly offered
me a lift back to Harrogate
tomorrow morning. Course.

139
00:09:45,457 --> 00:09:49,976
Only I'd be grateful if you...
you didn't drink any more.

140
00:09:49,977 --> 00:09:53,056
I don't want you throwing up in
t'car before Celia's even sat in it.

141
00:09:53,057 --> 00:09:54,376
Celia all right?

142
00:09:54,377 --> 00:09:58,856
Well, I think she'd have liked
a turn in t'car.

143
00:09:58,857 --> 00:10:03,617
Perhaps I should phone for that taxi.
Don't be daft. You stay put.
Oh, I'll go and put t'kettle on.

144
00:10:08,937 --> 00:10:11,176
You want to stick up for yourself
more, you do.

145
00:10:11,177 --> 00:10:13,297
Me? Yeah.

146
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:17,376
You know, if you weren't doing owt,

147
00:10:17,377 --> 00:10:21,657
if you genuinely weren't
doing owt with this Judith...

148
00:10:22,857 --> 00:10:25,856
why accept being chucked out?

149
00:10:25,857 --> 00:10:28,417
And presumably half the house
is yours.

150
00:11:02,577 --> 00:11:04,816
Morning, everyone!

151
00:11:04,817 --> 00:11:07,536

00:11:15,937 --> 00:11:18,617
Who wants pancakes?

156
00:11:37,457 --> 00:11:39,216
Morning! It's ten to eight.

157

Yes, I... Sorry I'm late.

00:12:12,897 --> 00:12:14,696
Pa-pa-pa pom!

162
00:12:14,697 --> 00:12:16,776
Do you believe in God?

163
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:20,376
I used to... to believe.

164
00:12:20,377 --> 00:12:22,217
Mid-to-late 1970s.

165
00:12:24,857 --> 00:12:28,336
What happened in the mid-to-late
1970s?

166
00:12:28,337 --> 00:12:30,576
I'm not sure.

167
00:12:30,577 --> 00:12:35,496
But, er... that's when we just
seemed to stop going. Why?

168
00:12:35,497 --> 00:12:40,376
I think I'd like to get married
in a church rather than
a registry office...

169
00:12:40,377 --> 00:12:42,336
on reflection.

170
00:12:42,337 --> 00:12:44,976
Who's that making that din?
Well, we can do.

171
00:12:44,977 --> 00:12:47,456
I...I don't think
it's obligatory these days,

172
00:12:47,457 --> 00:12:50,697
to believe in God, just cos
you want to get wed in church.

173
00:12:55,417 --> 00:12:58,656
What the hell on earth do you think
you're doing?! Morning, darling.

174
00:12:58,657 --> 00:13:01,176
Don't you shitting well
"darling" me! Potty mouth.

175
00:13:01,177 --> 00:13:03,496
What are you doing?
Breakfast. Want some?

176
00:13:03,497 --> 00:13:05,136
Is that John? Has she let him in?

177
00:13:05,137 --> 00:13:07,216
I live here!
How has he got back?

178
00:13:07,217 --> 00:13:11,456
No, you don't live here,
because I chucked you out
for being an arsehole!

179
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:13,536
Yes, well...

180
00:13:13,537 --> 00:13:15,376
half this house is mine!

181
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:17,976
I wasn't doing anything wrong!
She turned up!

182
00:13:17,977 --> 00:13:20,135
William exaggerated! Get over it!
Don't you touch that!

183
00:13:20,136 --> 00:13:22,017
And next time your mother slaps me,

184
00:13:22,018 --> 00:13:25,976
you tell her I will slap her right
back! Harder!

185
00:13:25,977 --> 00:13:28,736
You are not making a mess
in my kitchen!

186
00:13:28,737 --> 00:13:31,656
That's right!
I'm making a mess in my kitchen!

187
00:13:31,657 --> 00:13:35,736
You forfeited any right
to anything when you went off
shagging that whore!

188
00:13:35,737 --> 00:13:38,896
Shout a little bit louder, Caroline!

189
00:13:38,897 --> 00:13:40,816
It's not funny! No.

190
00:13:40,817 --> 00:13:44,896
Morally, I can't argue with you.
Legally, however, a tad more
compromise!

191
00:13:44,897 --> 00:13:46,816
I do not want you here!

192
00:13:46,817 --> 00:13:50,576
Well, I don't mind you being here.
It isn't like there isn't room,
is it?

193
00:13:50,577 --> 00:13:52,456
So, if you can't be civil to me,

194
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:54,856
just bugger off into another room,
all right?

195
00:13:54,857 --> 00:13:57,217
Because if you're going to be
difficult and unco-operative,

196
00:13:57,218 --> 00:14:00,216
I might just chuck
all your things out, OK?

197
00:14:00,217 --> 00:14:01,736
What's happening?

198
00:14:01,737 --> 00:14:03,257
Nothing.

199
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:06,976
Your father's behaving like a pig!

200
00:14:06,977 --> 00:14:08,857
Oh, damn. She's shut the window.

201
00:14:09,857 --> 00:14:13,296
You see, I'm not behaving like a pig.
I'm willing to be entirely
reasonable.

202
00:14:13,297 --> 00:14:16,137
You're doing breakfast, Popsicle?
Yes, I am. Cool.

203
00:14:28,257 --> 00:14:30,377
It's not funny!

204
00:14:35,377 --> 00:14:37,336
Hey!

205
00:14:37,337 --> 00:14:40,217
How do you fancy driving over
to Buckstones Ridge?

206
00:14:45,537 --> 00:14:48,057
Oh...

207
00:15:32,457 --> 00:15:33,657
I'm just off to work.

208
00:15:35,857 --> 00:15:37,737
Raff.

209
00:16:12,937 --> 00:16:14,056
Ah.

210
00:16:14,057 --> 00:16:16,096
What have you been saying to our
Raff?

211
00:16:16,097 --> 00:16:18,256
Oh, steady on, Gillian.
And going to the police?

212
00:16:18,257 --> 00:16:22,216
What kind of bloke gets
beaten up by a 16-year-old
and goes whining to the police?

213
00:16:22,217 --> 00:16:24,615
How about, "Thank you, Paul,
for not pressing charges"?

214
00:16:24,616 --> 00:16:25,697
What did you say to him?

215
00:16:25,698 --> 00:16:28,216
"Thank you, Paul, for letting
him get off with a caution."

216
00:16:28,217 --> 00:16:30,776
Nowt. I were just, like... You know.

217
00:16:30,777 --> 00:16:32,056
What?

218
00:16:32,057 --> 00:16:34,056
I were just saying
what a fine woman you was.

219
00:16:34,057 --> 00:16:35,696
You idiot. Any time, love.

220
00:16:35,697 --> 00:16:37,976
Well, he didn't believe you,
anyway. Ha-ha.

221
00:16:37,977 --> 00:16:39,936
Nah, he did.

222
00:16:39,937 --> 00:16:43,496
Not to start with, cheeky git.

223
00:16:43,497 --> 00:16:47,496
Not till I described the way
your wallpaper's peeling off
above t'window where it's damp.

224
00:16:47,497 --> 00:16:49,776
And your five million pair of shoes.

225
00:16:49,777 --> 00:16:53,456
And that photo he has by his bed of
him, his Uncle Robbie and his dad.

226
00:16:53,457 --> 00:16:55,776
Yeah, yeah,
I think that's when he realised

227
00:16:55,777 --> 00:16:58,216
I really had been in your upstairs.

228
00:16:58,217 --> 00:17:01,057
He went mad. Lickle bastard.

229
00:17:07,817 --> 00:17:09,497
That's...

230
00:18:13,097 --> 00:18:15,656
Hello? Gillian?

231
00:18:15,657 --> 00:18:18,656
Yeah? It's John Elliot.

232
00:18:18,657 --> 00:18:20,096
Caroline's husband.

233
00:18:20,097 --> 00:18:22,096
Oh.

234
00:18:22,097 --> 00:18:25,416
John.

235
00:18:25,417 --> 00:18:27,016
Hello.

236
00:18:27,017 --> 00:18:30,216
I'm just ringing to say thank you
for putting me up last night.

237
00:18:30,217 --> 00:18:31,576
Oh, that's...

238
00:18:31,577 --> 00:18:35,296
I stuck up for myself, and, er...
well, she didn't like it.

239
00:18:35,297 --> 00:18:37,176
Not surprisingly.

240
00:18:37,177 --> 00:18:39,016
But I did it.

241
00:18:39,017 --> 00:18:42,216
He's talking to someone.

242
00:18:42,217 --> 00:18:45,296
'Who?'
I've got no idea. He's smirking.

243
00:18:45,297 --> 00:18:47,416
It's probably her, Judith.

244
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:51,256
Well, I've no idea, Caroline.
I'm sorry I upset you.

245
00:18:51,257 --> 00:18:55,177
I'm sorry I didn't listen to you.
You were right. He's an absolute...

246
00:18:56,457 --> 00:18:59,096
jerk. I've spent
the best years of my life

247
00:18:59,097 --> 00:19:02,176
married to an unreliable,
shallow-minded...

248
00:19:02,177 --> 00:19:04,137
self-centred...

249
00:19:05,377 --> 00:19:06,977
jerk.

250
00:19:09,017 --> 00:19:10,056
Yes.

251
00:19:10,057 --> 00:19:12,136
What am I going to do?

252
00:19:12,137 --> 00:19:14,577
Divorce him,
and not just talk about it this time.

253
00:19:14,578 --> 00:19:17,136
Sell the house, split everything.
Start again.

254
00:19:17,137 --> 00:19:19,696
I can't sell this house! 'Why?'

255
00:19:19,697 --> 00:19:24,016
Because I... I've put so much into
it. I've worked so hard for it.

256
00:19:24,017 --> 00:19:26,896
It's perfect.
I don't want to sell...

257
00:19:26,897 --> 00:19:28,857
Anyway, I can't,
because my mother...

258
00:19:28,858 --> 00:19:32,976
Actually, my mother's
probably going to move out,
because she's getting married.

259
00:19:32,977 --> 00:19:35,096
Your mother? Yes.

260
00:19:35,097 --> 00:19:38,256
Your mother is getting married?
Who to?

261
00:19:38,257 --> 00:19:40,297
Oh, it's just...

262
00:19:42,657 --> 00:19:43,697
How sweet.

263
00:19:49,257 --> 00:19:50,857
Would you like me to come round?

264
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:55,497
'Would you like to go for a walk?
Would you like to do something?'

265
00:19:57,177 --> 00:19:59,337
Me going on about stuff
a bit too much, probably...

266
00:20:01,217 --> 00:20:04,497
That's such a beautiful
part of the world that you live in.

267
00:20:06,257 --> 00:20:07,976
John? John, John.

268
00:20:07,977 --> 00:20:10,337
I'm... I'm sorry.
I've got to go, cos I'm at work.

269
00:20:10,338 --> 00:20:12,616
Oh, I'm sorry.
Yeah, no... no problem.

270
00:20:12,617 --> 00:20:14,256
Ta-ta, then. Me waxing lyrical.

271
00:20:14,257 --> 00:20:16,216
Yeah. Aw. Bye!

272
00:20:16,217 --> 00:20:19,416
Probably see you again some
time anyway. Yeah, yep.

273
00:20:19,417 --> 00:20:21,577
Bye. Bye-bye. Bye.

274
00:20:26,937 --> 00:20:29,777
Sweet exotic creature.

275
00:20:41,817 --> 00:20:43,257
'So, 2 o'clock, then?'

276
00:20:45,977 --> 00:20:47,816
Jesus Christ.

277
00:20:47,817 --> 00:20:51,296
He's lit a cigarette.
'Is that very...'

278
00:20:51,297 --> 00:20:53,336
How bad is that?

279
00:20:53,337 --> 00:20:54,617
We don't smoke.

280
00:20:54,618 --> 00:20:56,616
Oh. Ah.

281
00:20:56,617 --> 00:21:00,176
And he's drinking whisky
at quarter-past 11 in the morning.

282
00:21:00,177 --> 00:21:02,776
And he's listening to the...
bloody Archers!

283
00:21:02,777 --> 00:21:03,817
I've got to go.

284
00:21:04,937 --> 00:21:07,057
Right, well, I'll see you at...

285
00:21:23,977 --> 00:21:26,536
You silly bitch!

286
00:21:26,537 --> 00:21:29,496
What kind of example
do you think you set these boys, hm?

287
00:21:29,497 --> 00:21:34,176
Smoking! And drinking
and fornicating!

288
00:21:34,177 --> 00:21:38,256
And wallowing there like some...
self-indulgent tosser!

289
00:21:38,257 --> 00:21:41,096
How dare you do that?
I do not want you here!

290
00:21:41,097 --> 00:21:46,776
Well, bad luck. I live here,
and if I want to smoke and bring
women here, then I'll bring them!

291
00:21:46,777 --> 00:21:48,976
But I don't want to bring women here!

292
00:21:48,977 --> 00:21:51,776
Because I want our marriage to work!

293
00:21:51,777 --> 00:21:54,576
You mad cow! This marriage is over!

294
00:21:54,577 --> 00:21:58,456
It is dead! It is redundant!
It... it never was!

295
00:21:58,457 --> 00:22:01,136
And I do not want to waste
another second of my life

296
00:22:01,137 --> 00:22:03,457
pretending it's something
worth saving!

297
00:22:06,497 --> 00:22:09,696

If anybody had told me
a few weeks ago

302
00:22:23,977 --> 00:22:27,096
that I'd be sitting
up at Buckstones Ridge,

303
00:22:27,097 --> 00:22:31,096
holding hands with a man
who isn't my husband,

304
00:22:31,097 --> 00:22:33,856
and who's just driven me
here in his Lexus,

305
00:22:33,857 --> 00:22:36,776
I'd have thought they were
pulling my leg.

306
00:22:36,777 --> 00:22:39,016
Not that I'd have ever sat anywhere

307
00:22:39,017 --> 00:22:41,577
holding hands with a man
who was my husband.

308
00:22:42,657 --> 00:22:45,656
Kenneth wasn't
the hand-holding sort.

309
00:22:45,657 --> 00:22:49,216
I mean, even before the trouble,

310
00:22:49,217 --> 00:22:53,376
I don't think he'd a romantic bone
in his body.

311
00:22:53,377 --> 00:22:56,936
And then after, when I'd found out
what a randy sod he'd been, well...

312
00:22:56,937 --> 00:23:02,177
that put the tin lid on any sort
of... Anything resembling romantic.

313
00:23:03,857 --> 00:23:07,456
I mean, I stopped going
anywhere with him socially.

314
00:23:07,457 --> 00:23:10,057
I mean, he didn't know who knew
and who didn't.

315
00:23:11,497 --> 00:23:15,496
And I work on the
principle it's always wise
to assume the worst.

316
00:23:15,497 --> 00:23:17,616
I mean, it's not nice, is it?

317
00:23:17,617 --> 00:23:21,136
Folk nudging each other, going,
"Ooh, that's her

318
00:23:21,137 --> 00:23:25,336
"whose husband's at it with
all and sundry behind her back.

319
00:23:25,337 --> 00:23:27,696
"I wonder if she knows, poor bitch.

320
00:23:27,697 --> 00:23:31,457
"I wonder what she's not doing
that's making him look elsewhere."

321
00:23:32,977 --> 00:23:34,857
So, you stop in. You don't go out.

322
00:23:38,017 --> 00:23:39,657
And your world gets smaller.

323
00:23:41,737 --> 00:23:43,337
I should have divorced him.

324
00:23:44,577 --> 00:23:46,696
But it's easy to say,
with a child to bring up

325
00:23:46,697 --> 00:23:50,096
and no money of your own.
And you see, I'd not worked.

326
00:23:50,097 --> 00:23:51,856
I had no career.

327
00:23:51,857 --> 00:23:54,896
I'd given up my job
when Caroline was born.

328
00:23:54,897 --> 00:23:56,897
Women did in them days.

329
00:23:59,617 --> 00:24:01,657
Could have killed him one time.

330
00:24:03,057 --> 00:24:04,937
I mean, literally, I could have!

331
00:24:06,857 --> 00:24:08,936
He was decorating the kitchen.

332
00:24:08,937 --> 00:24:11,937
Painting the ceiling
up a little stepladder.

333
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:15,977
He was hopeless
at anything to do with DIY.

334
00:24:17,977 --> 00:24:20,257
Anyway, he slipped
and banged his head.

335
00:24:21,817 --> 00:24:26,576
He must have been out for... oh,
well, no more than a second or two.

336
00:24:26,577 --> 00:24:28,376
But of course, I panicked.

337
00:24:28,377 --> 00:24:30,457
Till he came to.

338
00:24:31,457 --> 00:24:34,217
It was only afterwards
I realised I'd been slow.

339
00:24:35,617 --> 00:24:39,136
And I decided if it ever
happened again I'd slip
a cushion over his face

340
00:24:39,137 --> 00:24:40,937
and suffocate him.

341
00:24:47,097 --> 00:24:48,496
Have I shocked you?

342
00:24:48,497 --> 00:24:50,457
No.

343
00:24:52,497 --> 00:24:54,496
Oh, God.

344
00:24:54,497 --> 00:24:56,696
I'm sorry I go on about him.

345
00:24:56,697 --> 00:25:02,057
No, no, no, no. I'm just sorry you...
you had it to go through.

346
00:25:03,577 --> 00:25:07,737
I'm only telling you this
so you know what sort of a woman
you're marrying.

347
00:25:09,297 --> 00:25:12,017
Do you fancy a pint in a pub?

348
00:25:13,697 --> 00:25:15,217
I was thinking... Oh, aye?

349
00:25:16,777 --> 00:25:19,097
Why don't you stop tonight
in Harrogate?

350
00:25:20,897 --> 00:25:23,816
Oh, I don't mean anything untoward.

351
00:25:23,817 --> 00:25:25,057
I've got a spare room.

352
00:25:25,058 --> 00:25:31,136
Only it's going to be a long haul
for you otherwise,
taking me back to Harrogate

353
00:25:31,137 --> 00:25:33,136
then setting off to Halifax.

354
00:25:33,137 --> 00:25:35,897
And you were up
at the crack of dawn this morning.

355
00:25:38,697 --> 00:25:40,657
I'd have to buy a toothbrush.

356
00:25:56,217 --> 00:25:57,817
Raff?

357
00:26:01,337 --> 00:26:02,777
Raffy?

358
00:26:23,777 --> 00:26:26,376
Answer it.

359
00:26:26,377 --> 00:26:29,736
'I can't take your call. Leave a
message and I'll ring you back.'

360
00:26:29,737 --> 00:26:31,576
Raff, it's me.

361
00:26:31,577 --> 00:26:34,896
Where are you?
Just ring me or... or text me.

362
00:26:34,897 --> 00:26:36,337
I...I need to know where you are.

363
00:26:38,257 --> 00:26:41,496
I'm sorry if I've upset you.
I know I've upset you.

364
00:26:41,497 --> 00:26:43,777
But I need to know that you're all
right.

365
00:27:01,817 --> 00:27:04,177
Oh, shit.

366
00:27:14,017 --> 00:27:15,816
Gillian? Is Raff with you?

367
00:27:15,817 --> 00:27:17,456
He is, yeah.

368
00:27:17,457 --> 00:27:20,656
Is he all right?

369
00:27:20,657 --> 00:27:22,417
Yeah, he's absolutely fine.

370
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:27,496
What's he said? Nothing.

371
00:27:27,497 --> 00:27:31,096
Well, can I talk to him?
He's a bit busy at the minute.
He's on the Xbox.

372
00:27:31,097 --> 00:27:32,896
Yeah? Well, get him off the f...

373
00:27:32,897 --> 00:27:37,136
And to be frank I don't
think he'd want to talk with you.
I don't know what's happened,

374
00:27:37,137 --> 00:27:40,096
other than him fighting
with that dickhead,
but I assume something has.

375
00:27:40,097 --> 00:27:43,496
I assume that he's finally seen the
light and worked out what a mad
bitch you are,

376
00:27:43,497 --> 00:27:47,616
so you know, if he wants to move
in here, that's fine by me.

377
00:27:47,617 --> 00:27:52,056
I'm not keeping him here by force.
Don't you dare fill his head
with rubbish about me.

378
00:27:52,057 --> 00:27:55,417
Will that be everything, then?
You just tell him to ring me!

379
00:28:29,537 --> 00:28:31,136
Hello? John?

380
00:28:31,137 --> 00:28:32,297
Yeah? It's Gillian.

381
00:28:33,657 --> 00:28:34,897
Alan's daughter.

382
00:28:37,217 --> 00:28:38,536
Gillian.

383
00:28:38,537 --> 00:28:41,496
Sorry I had to ring off this morning.

384
00:28:41,497 --> 00:28:43,976
Only the boss were breathing
down my neck and...

385
00:28:43,977 --> 00:28:46,496
No, no, that's...
I thought nothing of it.

386
00:28:46,497 --> 00:28:47,696
Good, good.

387
00:28:47,697 --> 00:28:49,817
Good. So, how's things progressing?

388
00:28:52,457 --> 00:28:55,936
Oh, she's having a little
coven in the garden

389
00:28:55,937 --> 00:28:58,017
with some insipid little
witch that she works with.

390
00:28:58,018 --> 00:28:59,776
Nice.

391
00:28:59,777 --> 00:29:04,416
Lawrence says she's a lesbian.
God knows why Caroline's
invited her here.

392
00:29:04,417 --> 00:29:06,296
You know what you said last night

393
00:29:06,297 --> 00:29:09,977
about you having this
affair with this...

394
00:29:11,217 --> 00:29:12,257
Judith?

395
00:29:14,577 --> 00:29:17,417
Yeah? Well...

396
00:29:20,857 --> 00:29:22,697
I did something similar and...

397
00:29:23,857 --> 00:29:25,937
You did? Yeah, a...

398
00:29:27,297 --> 00:29:28,737
stupid, stupid thing.

399
00:29:31,417 --> 00:29:34,976
And Raff's found out,
and that's what that fight was about,

400
00:29:34,977 --> 00:29:36,776
and he's gone to live with Robbie.

401
00:29:36,777 --> 00:29:40,056
That's his uncle, the policeman.

402
00:29:40,057 --> 00:29:42,417
And he's a right bastard and...

403
00:29:45,777 --> 00:29:47,296
Bollocks!

404
00:29:47,297 --> 00:29:50,136
It was exactly the same
when me and Richard got divorced.

405
00:29:50,137 --> 00:29:52,217
Neither of us could afford
to buy the other one out

406
00:29:52,218 --> 00:29:54,616
so we had to sell up,
split everything.

407
00:29:54,617 --> 00:29:58,496
Right down the middle.
Beautiful house we had.

408
00:29:58,497 --> 00:30:00,656
It was heartbreaking.

409
00:30:00,657 --> 00:30:03,336
But you find a way forward.

410
00:30:03,337 --> 00:30:05,897
I'm going to have to get
proper legal advice.

411
00:30:07,457 --> 00:30:09,977
Yes, obviously.
I don't know what I'm talking about.

412
00:30:11,857 --> 00:30:16,096
Don't you? I was being sarcastic.
I just said I've been through
exactly the same thing,

413
00:30:16,097 --> 00:30:19,777
but, yes, you should get
proper legal advice.
Why are you being so snippy? Why?

414
00:30:21,497 --> 00:30:22,537
What?

415
00:30:26,657 --> 00:30:29,897
My dad's got Alzheimer's.
Did you know that?

416
00:30:31,297 --> 00:30:32,736
God, I'm so sorry.

417
00:30:32,737 --> 00:30:36,537
There's a million and one things
you don't know about me, Caroline...

418
00:30:37,617 --> 00:30:40,896
cos you never ask, and I try not
to inflict things on people

419
00:30:40,897 --> 00:30:42,976
unless I think
they're actually interested,

420
00:30:42,977 --> 00:30:45,137
but I've never really had
the impression that you were,

421
00:30:45,138 --> 00:30:47,656
but you just take it for granted
that I'll be interested in you.

422
00:30:47,657 --> 00:30:49,976
Don't you? You offered
to come round.

423
00:30:49,977 --> 00:30:52,776
Mm, but you rang me up.

424
00:30:52,777 --> 00:30:55,136
After you'd dumped me. Shh.

425
00:30:55,137 --> 00:30:59,016
You rang me up expecting me
to be sympathetic, which I am.

426
00:30:59,017 --> 00:31:02,176
Not that it'll do me any good.
And then you're like a man.

427
00:31:02,177 --> 00:31:05,136
You just make this decision
that I haven't got a clue

428
00:31:05,137 --> 00:31:07,617
what I'm talking about
even though I've been through it.

429
00:31:07,618 --> 00:31:11,656
I think you're overreacting.
You're reading things...
And then having a go at me last week

430
00:31:11,657 --> 00:31:14,736
for talking to someone when
I was upset about what had
happened.

431
00:31:14,737 --> 00:31:17,376
Someone who was sympathetic
and interested.

432
00:31:17,377 --> 00:31:20,096
Michael bloody Dobson?
He tried to blackmail me.

433
00:31:20,097 --> 00:31:22,777
He didn't. You'd better go.

434
00:31:25,177 --> 00:31:26,377
Am I being dismissed?

435
00:31:26,378 --> 00:31:28,937
I shouldn't have rang you up.
I'm sorry I did.

436
00:31:31,097 --> 00:31:32,377
Don't say that.

437
00:31:34,377 --> 00:31:36,097
I just want you to understand...

438
00:31:38,857 --> 00:31:43,577
the effect you have on me.

439
00:31:46,137 --> 00:31:50,256
If you ring me, I'll run round here,
even though I know you're not
really interested in me.

440
00:31:50,257 --> 00:31:55,737
I'm not... not interested in you.

441
00:31:57,497 --> 00:31:58,537
I'm...

442
00:32:01,177 --> 00:32:02,697
I don't know what I am. I...

443
00:32:04,577 --> 00:32:07,736
You're right, I've never asked
you anything about you,

444
00:32:07,737 --> 00:32:09,776
and it's not because I don't...

445
00:32:09,777 --> 00:32:13,177
It's because I'm selfish
and hopeless...

446
00:32:14,617 --> 00:32:18,216
and you've been a really good
friend, and I don't know how to be
a good friend.

447
00:32:18,217 --> 00:32:20,337
To anyone.

448
00:32:22,817 --> 00:32:24,816
My parents never got on.

449
00:32:24,817 --> 00:32:27,936
I grew up in a house on my own
with these people

450
00:32:27,937 --> 00:32:30,696
who never spoke to each
other unless they had to,

451
00:32:30,697 --> 00:32:32,576
and I thought that was normal.

452
00:32:32,577 --> 00:32:35,536
And now she's met this bloke,
this Alan, and he's a sweet man,

453
00:32:35,537 --> 00:32:38,216
and he thinks the world of her,
and she thinks the world of him,

454
00:32:38,217 --> 00:32:40,297
and she's so different!

455
00:32:42,657 --> 00:32:46,016
And I can't help wondering
if she'd been in love with my dad

456
00:32:46,017 --> 00:32:48,257
and he'd been in love with her...

457
00:32:49,617 --> 00:32:51,937
how different things
would have been.

458
00:32:53,497 --> 00:32:56,696
I don't know what
normal relationships are like.

459
00:32:56,697 --> 00:32:59,777
I see them,
but I don't know how to do them.

460
00:33:01,657 --> 00:33:03,616
So I'm sorry.

461
00:33:03,617 --> 00:33:08,017
I'm sorry if I've hurt you
or taken you for granted.

462
00:33:09,377 --> 00:33:12,296
I will endeavour not to do that...

463
00:33:12,297 --> 00:33:14,097
in the future.

464
00:33:17,177 --> 00:33:19,577
Because I do value
your friendship and...

465
00:33:21,737 --> 00:33:25,377
I'm sorry if I've never said
or made that clear or done what...

466
00:33:27,257 --> 00:33:30,297
normal people do
to express these things.

467
00:33:32,737 --> 00:33:33,777
So, I'm sorry.

468
00:33:36,177 --> 00:33:37,217
Thank you.

469
00:33:42,777 --> 00:33:46,496
I think you've got to give yourself
a break, Gillian, I really do.

470
00:33:46,497 --> 00:33:48,816
He's 16 years old. Give him a week.

471
00:33:48,817 --> 00:33:51,336
Give him a week
with Robbie's microwave cooking.

472
00:33:51,337 --> 00:33:54,976
Give Robbie a week with a bloody
teenager in the house. You're right.

473
00:33:54,977 --> 00:33:58,176
You know where he is. You know
he's safe. OK, he's had a shock.

474
00:33:58,177 --> 00:34:01,096
He's found out his mother has sex.
Get over it.

475
00:34:01,097 --> 00:34:03,216
I know, I know.
It's just life, you know?

476
00:34:03,217 --> 00:34:05,656
And he has to realise
that you have...

477
00:34:05,657 --> 00:34:07,936
you know, just like
everyone else does,

478
00:34:07,937 --> 00:34:09,856
urges, feelings,

479
00:34:09,857 --> 00:34:11,537
and when he's an adult,
he'll get it.

480
00:34:11,538 --> 00:34:14,336
He will not look back on you
and make judgments.

481
00:34:14,337 --> 00:34:18,216
He just needs a little bit of time.
Step back from it, Gillian.

482
00:34:18,217 --> 00:34:19,736
I know it's not easy.

483
00:34:19,737 --> 00:34:21,496
He's your boy, but,

484
00:34:21,497 --> 00:34:22,937
if you can... Yeah, yeah.

485
00:34:26,577 --> 00:34:28,656
Yeah, you're right, you're right.

486
00:34:28,657 --> 00:34:30,697
Oh, kids.

487
00:34:35,017 --> 00:34:37,457
Gosh.

488
00:34:38,657 --> 00:34:40,457
So, how's things in the garden?

489
00:34:43,017 --> 00:34:45,377
Oh, much the same.

490
00:35:40,497 --> 00:35:41,897
Oh, God!

491
00:35:43,817 --> 00:35:45,897
Paul. Jesus.

492
00:35:49,057 --> 00:35:51,497
What's happened? Paul? What?

493
00:35:53,337 --> 00:35:54,776
Who did this?

494
00:35:54,777 --> 00:35:58,256
Who did it? Was it Raff?

495
00:35:58,257 --> 00:36:00,297
Robbie?

496
00:36:02,217 --> 00:36:04,697
OK. Come on.

497
00:36:05,817 --> 00:36:07,057
Let's get you inside.

498
00:36:32,497 --> 00:36:34,577
I think we should get you up
to the Princess Royal.

499
00:36:34,578 --> 00:36:36,257
I'll be all right.

500
00:36:41,417 --> 00:36:42,497
What happened?

501
00:36:49,297 --> 00:36:50,337
Darren and Gavin.

502
00:36:52,977 --> 00:36:55,177
Hayley's brothers found out
I'd been at it with you

503
00:36:55,178 --> 00:36:58,217
so them and a couple of big
bastards laid into me.

504
00:37:01,817 --> 00:37:04,297
So, I... I guess the
engagement's off, eh?!

505
00:37:05,377 --> 00:37:07,937
You dirty sod.

506
00:37:12,337 --> 00:37:15,977
They said they was going
to pour petrol over me
and set me on fire.

507
00:37:18,057 --> 00:37:20,657
I believed them.

508
00:37:35,537 --> 00:37:38,017
Let Granny in.

509
00:37:41,377 --> 00:37:42,857
Thanks.

510
00:37:45,137 --> 00:37:48,136
Morning! Hi.

511
00:37:48,137 --> 00:37:51,056
Just to let you know...
Oh, you're very smart.

512
00:37:51,057 --> 00:37:53,136
Me and Alan are popping
over to Halifax

513
00:37:53,137 --> 00:37:55,736
to look at possible venues
for the wedding.

514
00:37:55,737 --> 00:37:59,856
So I won't be here this evening.
I'll be stopping over at
Gillian's with Alan.

515
00:37:59,857 --> 00:38:01,216
Right.

516
00:38:01,217 --> 00:38:04,536
I'm sorry to pop over so early
but you'll be going to work so...

517
00:38:04,537 --> 00:38:07,136
Brush your teeth.
Where are my shoes?

518
00:38:07,137 --> 00:38:09,256
Wherever you left them.

519
00:38:09,257 --> 00:38:12,897
He's very nervous.
He's got his first English paper.

520
00:38:14,337 --> 00:38:16,736
He stopped over last night, Alan.

521
00:38:16,737 --> 00:38:19,937
Yes, I assumed. I, um... saw the car.

522
00:38:21,377 --> 00:38:24,176
He was going to sleep
in the spare bedroom but...

523
00:38:24,177 --> 00:38:27,176
I don't know,
one thing led to another,

524
00:38:27,177 --> 00:38:31,376
and I've got a double bed
and we are getting married so...

525
00:38:31,377 --> 00:38:33,737
we shared the same bed.

526
00:38:35,217 --> 00:38:36,457
OK.

527
00:38:38,657 --> 00:38:41,496
I don't know what people'll think.

528
00:38:41,497 --> 00:38:44,656
Well, good for you.
I just thought, "What the hell?"

529
00:38:44,657 --> 00:38:46,656
What people?

530
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:49,297
I don't care. Anyone.

531
00:38:50,497 --> 00:38:52,456
Right.

532
00:38:52,457 --> 00:38:56,376
As I say, it's not as though
we're not getting married,
cos we are, so...

533
00:38:56,377 --> 00:38:58,256
So?

534
00:38:58,257 --> 00:39:00,656
You don't mind? Me? No.

535
00:39:00,657 --> 00:39:01,697
No, of course not.

536
00:39:03,657 --> 00:39:06,657
So... It's great.

537
00:39:10,897 --> 00:39:13,536
I'm talking about sex.
Yes, I realise that.

538
00:39:13,537 --> 00:39:15,416
It was marvellous.

539
00:39:15,417 --> 00:39:16,657
I'd forgotten.

540
00:39:19,617 --> 00:39:22,496
I can be quite a romantic,
when push comes to shove,

541
00:39:22,497 --> 00:39:26,256
not that your dad ever appreciated
that. Oh, can you not just...?

542
00:39:26,257 --> 00:39:29,656
What? Well, it's...
Oh. Have I embarrassed you?

543
00:39:29,657 --> 00:39:32,056
I don't need to know.
It's fine, it's fine.

544
00:39:32,057 --> 00:39:36,136
Whatever you do, it's fine, it's
good. You're adults. It's...

545
00:39:36,137 --> 00:39:38,057
I thought you might be happy for me.

546
00:39:38,058 --> 00:39:41,336
I am. I am!

547
00:39:41,337 --> 00:39:42,936
I love you, you know.

548
00:39:42,937 --> 00:39:44,577
I know you do.

549
00:40:10,737 --> 00:40:13,496
I can't get through
to our Gillian.

550
00:40:13,497 --> 00:40:17,017
She's not answering
her mobile or anything.

551
00:40:18,337 --> 00:40:19,937
Can I get you some more tea?

552
00:40:21,497 --> 00:40:23,616
No, no. No, no, I'm fine.

553
00:40:23,617 --> 00:40:26,777
Another egg? No, thanks.

554
00:40:33,137 --> 00:40:35,016
Sorry, what did you say?

555
00:40:35,017 --> 00:40:37,137
Something about Gillian?

556
00:41:10,617 --> 00:41:12,257
Right, where to?

557
00:41:14,337 --> 00:41:16,096
I can't go home.

558
00:41:16,097 --> 00:41:20,497
My dad's chucked me out and my mam
says she never wants to clap eyes
on me again.

559
00:41:29,977 --> 00:41:31,417
I'm not giving you Raffy's room.

560
00:42:56,977 --> 00:42:58,616
Hello?

561
00:42:58,617 --> 00:43:02,256
John? It's Judith.
What do you want?

562
00:43:02,257 --> 00:43:04,296
Er... I, um...

563
00:43:04,297 --> 00:43:06,217
You shouldn't ring this number.
What if Caroline had answered it?

564
00:43:06,218 --> 00:43:07,736
Isn't she at work?

565
00:43:07,737 --> 00:43:08,977
What do you want?

566
00:43:08,978 --> 00:43:12,056
You couldn't lend me some money,
could you?

567
00:43:12,057 --> 00:43:16,696
It's just that the landlord's
getting... unpleasant with me

568
00:43:16,697 --> 00:43:18,816
about the rent arrears and...

569
00:43:18,817 --> 00:43:20,696
You get benefits for that.

570
00:43:20,697 --> 00:43:23,056
Yeah, yeah.

571
00:43:23,057 --> 00:43:25,816
The thing is...

572
00:43:25,817 --> 00:43:29,176
I've spent it. Oh, Jesus.

573
00:43:29,177 --> 00:43:32,417
And you don't want me turning up
on your doorstep, do you?

574
00:43:36,337 --> 00:43:38,856
I must have spent hours in
here when I was a kid.

575
00:43:38,857 --> 00:43:40,296
Yeah, so did I.

576
00:43:40,297 --> 00:43:43,256
I always tried to, er... wangle it

577
00:43:43,257 --> 00:43:48,536
so that we'd sit somewhere
where I could gaze at you.

578
00:43:48,537 --> 00:43:51,176
You didn't? You daft article.

579
00:43:51,177 --> 00:43:53,497
You were the only thing
that made it bearable.

580
00:43:54,617 --> 00:43:57,016
I hated it, church.

581
00:43:57,017 --> 00:44:00,497
I used to get so bored and miserable.

582
00:44:01,857 --> 00:44:02,897
Yeah, well.

583
00:44:04,137 --> 00:44:08,216
Mind you, it's better than all this
happy-clappy stuff they have now.

584
00:44:08,217 --> 00:44:12,096
Mm? Do you want a mint?
Is it? Why? At least with
the happy-clappy stuff,

585
00:44:12,097 --> 00:44:14,456
people actually look like
they want to be there.

586
00:44:14,457 --> 00:44:16,816
Well, it's not proper, is it?

587
00:44:16,817 --> 00:44:19,256
They have pop songs at funerals now.

588
00:44:19,257 --> 00:44:20,937
Yeah? So what?

589
00:44:22,217 --> 00:44:24,056
Pop songs at funerals?

590
00:44:24,057 --> 00:44:27,896
Religion when we were kids
was all about control.

591
00:44:27,897 --> 00:44:31,696
It was about the ruling classes
being hand in glove with the Church

592
00:44:31,697 --> 00:44:36,497
to keep the ordinary hard-working
people terrified of having a mind of
their own.

593
00:44:37,577 --> 00:44:38,977
Was it hell?! No, it was.

594
00:44:38,978 --> 00:44:41,137
You think about it.

595
00:44:42,937 --> 00:44:44,696
I won't get into a debate.

596
00:44:44,697 --> 00:44:47,656
Why shouldn't you have
a pop song at a funeral

597
00:44:47,657 --> 00:44:52,736
if it's something that you've liked,
something that's meant something to
you?

598
00:44:52,737 --> 00:44:56,017
Pop songs are for... for discos
and pubs and social clubs.

599
00:44:58,857 --> 00:45:00,736
In church you sing hymns.

600
00:45:00,737 --> 00:45:02,056
Pop songs at funerals

601
00:45:02,057 --> 00:45:07,296
are about ordinary folk celebrating
whatever, in their own way,

602
00:45:07,297 --> 00:45:11,456
not accepting what's inflicted on
them by people in high places,

603
00:45:11,457 --> 00:45:14,697
who just want to keep everybody
frightened and miserable.

604
00:45:15,697 --> 00:45:19,336
Well...

605
00:45:19,337 --> 00:45:23,857
some people need people
in high places to tell them
what's what now and again.

606
00:45:25,857 --> 00:45:29,337
You're going to tell me next
you voted for Margaret Thatcher.

607
00:45:30,337 --> 00:45:33,896
Well, you can't have liked
Michael Foot?

608
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:35,617
In his anorak at the Cenotaph?

609
00:45:37,097 --> 00:45:39,496
A very intelligent man, Michael Foot.

610
00:45:39,497 --> 00:45:41,496
Oh, he can't have been that
intelligent

611
00:45:41,497 --> 00:45:44,936
or he wouldn't have gone around
looking like a scarecrow.

612
00:45:44,937 --> 00:45:46,937
I didn't dislike Tony Blair... Oh!

613
00:45:48,457 --> 00:45:50,656
Until he muckied his ticket
in Iraq.

614
00:45:50,657 --> 00:45:54,816
Now, Gordon Brown,
there's a much-maligned man.

615
00:45:54,817 --> 00:45:57,416
Gordon Brown? Mm.

616
00:45:57,417 --> 00:46:01,416
Trying to get everybody to like him,
with his phoney grin?

617
00:46:01,417 --> 00:46:03,456
And he's Scottish.

618
00:46:03,457 --> 00:46:06,016
Now, there's an unassailable
political argument!

619
00:46:06,017 --> 00:46:08,896
Well, it hardly needs pointing
out he buggered up the economy.

620
00:46:08,897 --> 00:46:10,336
No, he didn't.

621
00:46:10,337 --> 00:46:12,976
He did not. He had vision.

622
00:46:12,977 --> 00:46:16,176
Oh, God. I can see this is a subject
we're going to have to avoid.

623
00:46:16,177 --> 00:46:19,496
No, don't worry, I'll teach you.
You damn well won't.

624
00:46:19,497 --> 00:46:21,417
Yeah, we'll buy you
a copy of the Guardian.

625
00:46:21,418 --> 00:46:24,176
You can keep your Guardian.

626
00:46:24,177 --> 00:46:27,976
I thought I spotted a Daily Mail
lurking in your recycling bin.

627
00:46:27,977 --> 00:46:30,816
What's wrong with the Daily Mail?
What's wrong with it?

628
00:46:30,817 --> 00:46:32,496
What's right with it?

629
00:46:32,497 --> 00:46:36,216
Do you know, I'd never have
had you down for red-hot Labour.

630
00:46:36,217 --> 00:46:39,456
I thought you had more about you.

631
00:46:39,457 --> 00:46:42,656
Do you know,
the good thing about David Cameron

632
00:46:42,657 --> 00:46:45,736
is that even he knows he's an arse!

633
00:46:45,737 --> 00:46:48,576
No, every time he opens his mouth,
you can see him thinking,

634
00:46:48,577 --> 00:46:53,496
"I was born an arse,
I'll die an arse, but at
least I know I'm an arse."

635
00:46:53,497 --> 00:46:57,536
You've suddenly got very coarse,
Mr Buttershaw.

636
00:46:57,537 --> 00:47:01,976
So, what will you be walking
down the aisle to, then? Mm?

637
00:47:01,977 --> 00:47:05,177
Jerusalem? Rule Britannia?

638
00:47:07,177 --> 00:47:08,977
The Arrival Of The Queen Of Sheba.

639
00:47:12,297 --> 00:47:13,337
What?

640
00:47:15,097 --> 00:47:16,137
What?

641
00:47:17,857 --> 00:47:19,736
No, no, that's...

642
00:47:19,737 --> 00:47:21,856
What?!

643
00:47:21,857 --> 00:47:23,257
It's very appropriate!

644
00:47:25,817 --> 00:47:27,817
Mm, I'd turn up for that.

645
00:47:28,817 --> 00:47:33,696
I can see how I'm going to have
to re-educate you, Alan Buttershaw.

646
00:47:33,697 --> 00:47:37,496
Does that mean I get to choose
the music we walk out to?

647
00:47:37,497 --> 00:47:39,096
Hell, no.

648
00:47:39,097 --> 00:47:40,816
It's become screamingly obvious

649
00:47:40,817 --> 00:47:43,497
I can't trust you any further
than I could chuck you.

650
00:47:45,777 --> 00:47:47,736
Hey.

651
00:47:47,737 --> 00:47:51,016
I forgot we're in church.
We've been swearing like troopers.

652
00:47:51,017 --> 00:47:53,497
Well, we'd better find t'vicar, then.

653
00:47:54,937 --> 00:47:56,536
If this is what you want.

654
00:47:56,537 --> 00:48:00,016
Well, not if you think
I'm oppressing the masses.

655
00:48:00,017 --> 00:48:03,656
Oh, it'll be worth oppressing
the masses for half an hour or so

656
00:48:03,657 --> 00:48:06,857
to see you arriving
like the Queen of Sheba.

657
00:48:10,657 --> 00:48:12,616
I hope it isn't a woman.

658
00:48:12,617 --> 00:48:14,176
Who?

659
00:48:14,177 --> 00:48:16,217
The vicar.

660
00:48:21,537 --> 00:48:25,297
If you're insisting on a Saturday
slot, you're looking at four...

661
00:48:27,937 --> 00:48:29,097
five months away.

662
00:48:31,937 --> 00:48:34,057
I think sooner rather than later.
Mm.

663
00:48:37,017 --> 00:48:38,417
Are either of you divorced?

664
00:48:38,418 --> 00:48:39,457
No. No, no.

665
00:48:40,857 --> 00:48:42,137
Widowed.

666
00:48:43,617 --> 00:48:46,497
And you're both regular churchgoers,
obviously?

667
00:48:49,177 --> 00:48:50,897
Well, we have been in the past.

668
00:48:53,337 --> 00:48:54,377
Hm.

669
00:48:55,977 --> 00:48:59,136
So, you're not regular churchgoers
now?

670
00:48:59,137 --> 00:49:00,977
Not... No.

671
00:49:02,057 --> 00:49:04,497
When did you last go to church?

672
00:49:05,777 --> 00:49:07,137
Er... Christmas?

673
00:49:08,177 --> 00:49:10,136
19...oh, er...

674
00:49:10,137 --> 00:49:11,617
77?

675
00:49:12,697 --> 00:49:15,456
What about you,

676
00:49:15,457 --> 00:49:17,976
Mrs Dawson? About the same.

677
00:49:17,977 --> 00:49:19,216
Mm.

678
00:49:19,217 --> 00:49:23,576
So, why do you want God's blessing,

679
00:49:23,577 --> 00:49:25,137
if you don't go to church?

680
00:49:26,737 --> 00:49:28,937
I'm just interested.

681
00:49:34,257 --> 00:49:35,857
We thought he might like the trade.

682
00:49:48,777 --> 00:49:51,776
Miserable bitch!

683
00:49:51,777 --> 00:49:54,417
I mean, no wonder folk don't go.

684
00:49:56,897 --> 00:49:59,936
Oh, we could live over t'brush.

685
00:49:59,937 --> 00:50:02,576
Ah, but then you wouldn't be
Mrs Buttershaw.

686
00:50:02,577 --> 00:50:07,216
No, and I fancy having a do.
I want to buy a hat.

687
00:50:07,217 --> 00:50:10,696
Oh, we could find another vicar.
I bet they're not all like that.

688
00:50:10,697 --> 00:50:14,736
No, she's put me off. That's it,
now, with me and the Church. End of.

689
00:50:14,737 --> 00:50:17,536
Good night, Vienna.
I've left the building.

690
00:50:17,537 --> 00:50:19,616
Well, where would you like
to get wed?

691
00:50:19,617 --> 00:50:23,056
Cos, I mean, you can get
wed anywhere now, you know.

692
00:50:23,057 --> 00:50:24,377
Oh, somewhere classy.

693
00:50:26,257 --> 00:50:27,297
Oh, yeah.

694
00:50:28,457 --> 00:50:30,016
South Ouram Hall.

695
00:50:30,017 --> 00:50:32,016
South Ouram Hall.

696
00:50:32,017 --> 00:50:34,377
Oh, I used to love South Ouram Hall.

697
00:50:35,497 --> 00:50:38,456
Is it still there?
Yeah, yeah, far as I know.

698
00:50:38,457 --> 00:50:39,777
They've not mucked it up?

699
00:50:39,778 --> 00:50:43,537
No, I think
it's just as creepy as it ever were.

700
00:51:27,817 --> 00:51:31,857
What's he doing here? It's my house.

701
00:51:33,897 --> 00:51:35,736
Slapper.

702
00:51:35,737 --> 00:51:38,536
Yeah, whatever.

703
00:51:38,537 --> 00:51:41,457
What do you mean? Is this what...?

704
00:51:43,217 --> 00:51:44,537
You and him?

705
00:51:47,017 --> 00:51:50,257
Right. I'm off upstairs
to get the rest of my stuff.

706
00:51:52,457 --> 00:51:53,497
I'll be outside.

707
00:51:54,897 --> 00:51:57,737
You really do need
your head examined.

708
00:52:16,657 --> 00:52:17,697
Ah! Ah!

709
00:52:19,977 --> 00:52:22,817
Oh! Oh!

710
00:52:28,897 --> 00:52:30,977
Hello? Shop?

711
00:52:36,297 --> 00:52:39,616
What, nobody about?
No, doesn't look like it.

712
00:52:39,617 --> 00:52:41,217
Hello?

713
00:52:45,577 --> 00:52:46,777
Hello?

714
00:52:51,137 --> 00:52:53,297
Hello?

715
00:53:07,177 --> 00:53:10,056
My cousin Alice
saw a ghost here once.

716
00:53:10,057 --> 00:53:13,176
Where? Er... upstairs.

717
00:53:13,177 --> 00:53:15,856
What was it like?

718
00:53:15,857 --> 00:53:17,457
A woman.

719
00:53:34,257 --> 00:53:35,576
Don't go.

720
00:53:35,577 --> 00:53:38,296
I can't chuck him out.
He's got nowhere else to go.

721
00:53:38,297 --> 00:53:40,897
I'll... I'll go.
You can't! You... You can't.

722
00:53:49,137 --> 00:53:51,177
Don't.

723
00:54:11,657 --> 00:54:14,137
I...I think it were this room.

724
00:54:28,297 --> 00:54:30,576
Er... she came through that door.

725
00:54:30,577 --> 00:54:33,016
She walked across here...

726
00:54:33,017 --> 00:54:35,777
and disappeared through that wall.

727
00:54:36,737 --> 00:54:39,297
Ooh.

728
00:54:49,417 --> 00:54:50,777
Shall we go?

729
00:54:52,697 --> 00:54:55,457
Power cut. Let's go.

730
00:55:08,377 --> 00:55:09,417
Oh!

731
00:55:15,177 --> 00:55:16,936
Hello? Is anybody there?

732
00:55:16,937 --> 00:55:18,936
Hello?

733
00:55:18,937 --> 00:55:20,417
Hello? Telephone.

734
00:55:24,697 --> 00:55:26,817
I've got no reception.
Neither have I.

735
00:55:45,297 --> 00:55:46,777
What the...

736
00:55:52,417 --> 00:55:54,697
Oh... No...

737
00:56:10,057 --> 00:56:12,856
Do you think anyone's
realised that we're missing?

738
00:56:12,857 --> 00:56:16,016
I just worry about my dad having
his pills on him for his heart.

739
00:56:16,017 --> 00:56:18,056
There's somebody up there.

740
00:56:18,057 --> 00:56:20,417
How do you know he hasn't
taken her to some hotel

741
00:56:20,418 --> 00:56:22,696
for a wild night
of nudge-nudge, wink-wink?

742
00:56:22,697 --> 00:56:24,416
Where the hell are they?

743
00:56:24,417 --> 00:56:28,816
Why's the car there and
them not in it? You still have to
stay sober long enough

744
00:56:28,817 --> 00:56:32,616
to actually get it down
in black and white. Piss off!
Do you think they're dead?

745
00:56:32,617 --> 00:56:35,536
What were you doing with that
dipstick? Did you torch my
Land Rover?

746
00:56:35,537 --> 00:56:39,977
I'm not living with you while you're
having it off with someone else.
Well, you know where the door is.

747
00:56:40,379 --> 00:57:11,320
