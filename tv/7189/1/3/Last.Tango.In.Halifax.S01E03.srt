1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,302
我们对结婚是认真的。无论什么。我给你写了张便条说我不能来。
We're serious about getting married. Whatever. I sent you a note to say I couldn't come.

2
00:00:05,509 --> 00:00:07,070
我把它交给艾琳·皮克福德，让她交给你。
I gave it to Eileen Pickford to give to you.

3
00:00:07,071 --> 00:00:08,389
艾琳?
Eileen?

4
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:10,949
我的母亲吗?是的。
My mother? Yeah.

5
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:12,870
不，别告诉我你没拿到?
No, don't tell me you didn't get it?

6
00:00:12,871 --> 00:00:15,309
我很……喜欢你。
I'm very... fond of you.

7
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:18,189
我只是觉得我不能再这样下去了。
I just don't think I can do this any more.

8
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:19,708
我以涉嫌袭击罪逮捕你。
I'm arresting you on suspicion of assault.

9
00:00:19,776 --> 00:00:20,815
你不能逮捕他!
You're not arresting him!

10
00:00:20,816 --> 00:00:22,737
这是关于你在田野里弯腰
There's summat about you bending over in a field

11
00:00:22,738 --> 00:00:24,976
这让我几乎无法控制自己。
that makes me almost unable to contain myself.

12
00:00:24,977 --> 00:00:26,856
噢!
Ow!

13
00:00:26,857 --> 00:00:29,776
告诉我我爸什么时候去世的。这不是意外。她杀了他。
Tell me about when my dad died. It wasn't an accident. She killed him.

14
00:00:29,777 --> 00:00:32,216
我们决定不买订婚戒指
We decided against an engagement ring,

15
00:00:32,217 --> 00:00:35,416
所以，我们俩买了一辆车。
so instead, we bought a car between us.

16
00:00:35,417 --> 00:00:37,776
朱蒂丝，这是威廉，我的长子。你好。
Judith, this is William, my eldest. Hello.

17
00:00:37,777 --> 00:00:40,456
他在我们家搞过那个婊子。
He's had that bitch in our house.

18
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:42,137
别再回来了。
Don't come back.

19
00:00:45,182 --> 00:01:30,648

<font color="#3399CC">Subtitles by </font><font color="ffffff">MemoryOnSmells</font> <font color="#3399CC">http://UKsubtitles.ru.</font>

20
00:01:30,657 --> 00:01:32,816
你不能就这样离开他。我不能?
You can't just leave him. Can't I?

21
00:01:32,817 --> 00:01:34,816
为什么不呢?他离开了我。
Why not? He left me.

22
00:01:34,817 --> 00:01:37,536
我是说，你不能把他丢在荒郊野外。
I mean, you can't just abandon him in the middle of nowhere.

23
00:01:37,537 --> 00:01:40,296
你认为我应该让他一次又一次地羞辱我……
You think I should let him humiliate me over and over again...

24
00:01:40,297 --> 00:01:45,016
弯曲!．.假装一切都很好，而实际上
Bend! ..and pretend that everything's fine and dandy, when in actual fact

25
00:01:45,017 --> 00:01:46,857
我快要精神崩溃了?
I'm having a nervous bloody breakdown?

26
00:01:46,858 --> 00:01:48,097
妈妈!
Mum!

27
00:02:00,577 --> 00:02:01,657
哦。
Oh.

28
00:02:02,817 --> 00:02:03,857
你还好吗?
Are you all right?

29
00:02:05,137 --> 00:02:06,217
卡洛琳?
Caroline?

30
00:02:21,137 --> 00:02:24,896
白痴。你是个白痴。
Idiot. You're an idiot.

31
00:02:24,897 --> 00:02:27,176
为什么我是白痴?告诉她。
Why am I an idiot? Telling her.

32
00:02:27,177 --> 00:02:29,496
他可能什么都没做。
He probably wasn't even doing anything.

33
00:02:29,497 --> 00:02:31,776
他恨她。他讨厌朱蒂丝。
He hates her. He hates Judith.

34
00:02:31,777 --> 00:02:34,337
他可能只是想摆脱她。
He was probably just trying to get rid of her.

35
00:02:44,937 --> 00:02:45,977
妈妈。
Mum.

36
00:02:49,977 --> 00:02:51,536
我很抱歉。
I'm sorry.

37
00:02:51,537 --> 00:02:53,056
我不该说的。
I shouldn't have said anything.

38
00:02:53,057 --> 00:02:54,975
他们什么也没做。他们只是喝醉了。
They weren't doing anything. They were just drunk.

39
00:02:54,976 --> 00:02:56,417
他让她进了屋子。
He let her into the house.

40
00:02:57,937 --> 00:03:00,456
他们是否做了什么并不重要。
It doesn't matter whether they were doing anything or not.

41
00:03:00,457 --> 00:03:04,457
重要的是他肤浅，意志薄弱……
What matters is that he's shallow and weak-willed...

42
00:03:05,817 --> 00:03:08,057
我不能相信他
and I can't trust him.

43
00:03:09,057 --> 00:03:10,297
虽然我很想去。
Much as I'd like to.

44
00:03:11,937 --> 00:03:12,977
为了你。
For your sake.

45
00:03:14,257 --> 00:03:16,056
我的缘故。
My sake.

46
00:03:16,057 --> 00:03:17,497
每个人的缘故。
Everyone's sake.

47
00:03:30,457 --> 00:03:31,897
你还好吗，妈妈?
Are you all right, Mum?

48
00:03:34,337 --> 00:03:35,777
是吗?
Are you?

49
00:03:38,897 --> 00:03:40,257
来吧。
Come on.

50
00:03:54,537 --> 00:03:57,016
我找不到停车位。
I couldn't find a parking space.

51
00:03:57,017 --> 00:03:58,177
他们说了什么?
What have they said?

52
00:03:59,817 --> 00:04:03,136
嗯…他们没有提出指控。这只是一个警告。
Um... they're not pressing charges. It is just a caution.

53
00:04:03,137 --> 00:04:04,177
哦。
Oh.

54
00:04:05,897 --> 00:04:09,776
我知道这辆车看起来很奢华。
Here, I know it looks extravagant, the car.

55
00:04:09,777 --> 00:04:13,617
是的，你妈妈可能会喜欢，但我不知道，我…
And, yeah, your mother might have liked one, but I don't know, I...

56
00:04:15,417 --> 00:04:18,097
她从不为车而烦恼。
She were never bothered about cars.

57
00:04:20,297 --> 00:04:21,337
奇数。
Odd.

58
00:04:22,537 --> 00:04:27,017
你说我妈妈没有给你那张纸条。
That thing you said about my mother not giving you that note.

59
00:04:29,777 --> 00:04:32,536
你希望她这么做吗?给你的?
Do you wish she had? Given it to you?

60
00:04:32,537 --> 00:04:34,776
你不能这么想，对吧?
Well, you can't think like that, can you?

61
00:04:34,777 --> 00:04:36,376
没有，但你呢?
No, but do you?

62
00:04:36,377 --> 00:04:38,896
不!当然不是!
No! Course not!

63
00:04:38,897 --> 00:04:42,936
但你不生她的气，因为她没做什么?
But you aren't cross with her, for not doing?

64
00:04:42,937 --> 00:04:44,097
不。
No.

65
00:04:46,937 --> 00:04:50,496
我母亲是个了不起的女人。
She was a fantastic woman, my mother.

66
00:04:50,497 --> 00:04:53,216
是的，她是。你是对的。
Yeah, she were. You're right.

67
00:04:53,217 --> 00:04:55,217
我当然没什么可抱怨的。
I've certainly got no complaints.

68
00:04:58,417 --> 00:05:00,416
尘埃落定。
Done and dusted.

69
00:05:00,417 --> 00:05:04,016
下次，离那个讨厌的小娘们远点。
And next time, give the weedy little twat a wide berth.

70
00:05:04,017 --> 00:05:05,737
你没事吧?
You all right?

71
00:05:09,257 --> 00:05:10,377
是关于什么的?
What were it about?

72
00:05:12,097 --> 00:05:15,777
吉莉安吗?你知道的和我一样多，Robbie。
Gillian? You know as much as me, Robbie.

73
00:05:34,657 --> 00:05:38,056
那个探长说了什么?的东西。
What did he say, the inspector? Stuff.

74
00:05:38,057 --> 00:05:39,857
回头见。正确的。
I'll see you back there. Right.

75
00:05:41,097 --> 00:05:43,537
Paul Jaktri说了什么?
And what was Paul Jaktri saying?

76
00:05:44,577 --> 00:05:45,736
大便。
Shit.

77
00:05:45,737 --> 00:05:48,137
什么鬼东西?我能和我爷爷一起开雷克萨斯吗?
What kind of shit? Can I go in t'Lexus with my grandad?

78
00:05:48,138 --> 00:05:50,177
什么鬼东西?爷爷，我能和你一起去吗?
What kind of shit? Grandad, can I go with you?

79
00:05:53,097 --> 00:05:55,096
你还好吗?对不起，我破坏了你的聚会。
You OK? I'm sorry I spoilt your party.

80
00:05:55,097 --> 00:05:56,137
啊…
Ah...

81
00:06:23,937 --> 00:06:25,217
啊。
Ah.

82
00:06:27,697 --> 00:06:29,056
我要回我的房间了。
I'm going to my room.

83
00:06:29,057 --> 00:06:32,216
我想我最好还是多呆一会儿。你没锁门。
I thought I'd better hang about. You left the door unlocked.

84
00:06:32,217 --> 00:06:34,776
我给西莉亚打个电话，看看她怎么样了。
I'll ring Celia, see if she's all right.

85
00:06:34,777 --> 00:06:36,256
正确的。毫米。
Right. Mm.

86
00:06:36,257 --> 00:06:41,017
如何……事情怎么样，嗯…警察局吗?
How... how were things at the, um... police station?

87
00:06:43,257 --> 00:06:47,096
我不想让你和卡洛琳误会我们的关系。
I'd hate you and Caroline to get the wrong idea about us.

88
00:06:47,097 --> 00:06:48,736
看在我爸爸的份上。
For my dad's sake.

89
00:06:48,737 --> 00:06:52,056
他不是这样的，拉菲。他是个好孩子。
This isn't how he behaves, Raffy. He's a good lad.

90
00:06:52,057 --> 00:06:53,416
我相信他是。
I'm sure he is.

91
00:06:53,417 --> 00:06:57,736
天知道他为什么不能摆脱它。他……他会做得很正常。
God knows why he couldn't rise above it. He... he would do normally.

92
00:06:57,737 --> 00:07:00,136
的孩子。好吧，男孩们，不管怎样。
Kids. Well, boys, anyway.

93
00:07:00,137 --> 00:07:01,816
我…我自己吃。好。
I...I helped myself. Good.

94
00:07:01,817 --> 00:07:03,937
我希望那是…绝对好。
I hope that's... Absolutely fine.

95
00:07:06,257 --> 00:07:09,056
抱歉……怎么啦？
Sorry about... What?

96
00:07:09,057 --> 00:07:12,096
哦，公共场合的家丑。我和卡洛琳。
Oh, dirty linen in public. Me and Caroline.

97
00:07:12,097 --> 00:07:15,936
嘿,听。别跟我道歉。
Hey, listen. Don't apologise to me.

98
00:07:15,937 --> 00:07:19,256
没有任何理由。我不评判别人。
Not for anything. I don't judge people.

99
00:07:19,257 --> 00:07:22,496
从来没有。人生苦短。
Never have done. Life's too short.

100
00:07:22,497 --> 00:07:24,816
让我们坦率地说。
Let's be frank.

101
00:07:24,817 --> 00:07:28,097
我们都不完美。讽刺的是……
We're none of us perfect. The ironic thing is...

102
00:07:29,297 --> 00:07:31,576
怎么啦？哦。
What? Oh.

103
00:07:31,577 --> 00:07:34,056
我有这个…
I had this...

104
00:07:34,057 --> 00:07:35,936
扔东西,
fling thing,

105
00:07:35,937 --> 00:07:37,976
affair-fest,
affair-fest,

106
00:07:37,977 --> 00:07:40,736
这个朱蒂丝的尴尬错误
embarrassing mistake thing with this Judith,

107
00:07:40,737 --> 00:07:43,457
四个……三个月前。
four... three months ago.

108
00:07:44,417 --> 00:07:45,737
我无聊的时候告诉我。
Tell me when I get boring.

109
00:07:45,738 --> 00:07:48,256
重点是她…
Oh, the point is she...

110
00:07:48,257 --> 00:07:52,536
我一个人在屋里。我们的家，我和卡罗琳的家。
I was in the house by myself. Our house, mine and Caroline's.

111
00:07:52,537 --> 00:07:55,816
然后她出现了。朱迪思。
And she turns up. Judith.

112
00:07:55,817 --> 00:07:59,576
我也甩不掉她。威廉很早就放学回家了，
And I can't get rid of her. William comes home from school early,

113
00:07:59,577 --> 00:08:01,696
因为他的高级水平考试才考到一半。
because he's in the middle of his A levels.

114
00:08:01,697 --> 00:08:04,176
他以为我们在做什么。
He assumes we're up to stuff.

115
00:08:04,177 --> 00:08:06,456
但我们不是。绝对不是。到处都是。
Which we're not. Absolutely not. All over.

116
00:08:06,457 --> 00:08:08,576
过去的事了。大错特错。
Thing of the past. Big, bad mistake.

117
00:08:08,577 --> 00:08:13,496
非常感激能回到光荣，高傲，疯狂的卡罗琳身边，
Desperately grateful to be back with glorious, snotty, mad Caroline,

118
00:08:13,497 --> 00:08:15,017
虽然是在空卧室里。
albeit in the spare bedroom.

119
00:08:16,057 --> 00:08:20,617
可现在她又疯了，说我又疯了。
But now she's gone all berserk and says I'm out on my ear again.

120
00:08:22,137 --> 00:08:23,576
大便。
Shit.

121
00:08:23,577 --> 00:08:24,617
我已经……
I've...

122
00:08:26,697 --> 00:08:30,216
我得上楼去看看拉菲怎么样了。
just got to pop upstairs and see if Raffy's OK.

123
00:08:30,217 --> 00:08:32,056
确定。
Sure.

124
00:08:32,057 --> 00:08:33,977
确定。
Sure.

125
00:08:46,577 --> 00:08:47,617
拉夫?
Raff?

126
00:08:49,577 --> 00:08:53,176
我想知道保罗说了什么让你这么生气。
I want to know what Paul was saying that made you so cross.

127
00:08:53,177 --> 00:08:57,296
他是个白痴。我不能说我会和你争论这个问题。
He's an idiot. Well, I can't say I'd argue with you over that.

128
00:08:57,297 --> 00:08:59,537
你也是个白痴。
And you're an idiot as well.

129
00:09:13,057 --> 00:09:15,697
车怎么样了?粉碎。
How's the car? Smashing.

130
00:09:16,737 --> 00:09:19,056
你不能开车送我去最近的火车站吗?
You couldn't drive me to the nearest railway?

131
00:09:19,057 --> 00:09:22,336
你要去哪里?哈罗盖特。
Well, where are you heading? Well, Harrogate.

132
00:09:22,337 --> 00:09:26,016
我开车送你去。我要去看西莉亚。她几乎没见过那辆车。
Well, I'll drive you there. I'm off over to see Celia. She's barely seen that car.

133
00:09:26,017 --> 00:09:28,256
但必须是明天早上。
But it'll have to be tomorrow morning.

134
00:09:28,257 --> 00:09:30,256
我现在不走!
I'm not setting off now!

135
00:09:30,257 --> 00:09:34,056
它是黑暗的。很好。太好了。是…?
It's dark. Fine. Great. Is that...?

136
00:09:34,057 --> 00:09:36,457
所以…我能留下吗?
So... so could I stay?

137
00:09:38,577 --> 00:09:40,097
他能留下来吗?
Can he stay?

138
00:09:41,177 --> 00:09:45,456
艾伦很好心地让我明天早上搭车回哈罗盖特。课程。
Alan's very kindly offered me a lift back to Harrogate tomorrow morning. Course.

139
00:09:45,457 --> 00:09:49,976
如果你……我会很感激的。你不再喝酒了。
Only I'd be grateful if you... you didn't drink any more.

140
00:09:49,977 --> 00:09:53,056
我不希望西莉亚还没坐进车里你就吐了。
I don't want you throwing up in t'car before Celia's even sat in it.

141
00:09:53,057 --> 00:09:54,376
西莉亚还好吧?
Celia all right?

142
00:09:54,377 --> 00:09:58,856
我想她会想去我车里转转的。
Well, I think she'd have liked a turn in t'car.

143
00:09:58,857 --> 00:10:03,617
也许我应该打电话叫辆出租车。别傻了。你待在原地。哦，我去把水壶烧上。
Perhaps I should phone for that taxi. Don't be daft. You stay put. Oh, I'll go and put t'kettle on.

144
00:10:08,937 --> 00:10:11,176
你更想维护自己，你确实想。
You want to stick up for yourself more, you do.

145
00:10:11,177 --> 00:10:13,297
我吗?是的。
Me? Yeah.

146
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:17,376
你知道，如果你不做什么，
You know, if you weren't doing owt,

147
00:10:17,377 --> 00:10:21,657
如果你真的没有和这个朱蒂丝做什么
if you genuinely weren't doing owt with this Judith...

148
00:10:22,857 --> 00:10:25,856
为什么要接受被开除?
why accept being chucked out?

149
00:10:25,857 --> 00:10:28,417
大概房子的一半都是你的。
And presumably half the house is yours.

150
00:11:02,577 --> 00:11:04,816
早上好,每个人!
Morning, everyone!

151
00:11:04,817 --> 00:11:07,536
爸爸回来了!爸爸回来了!
Daddy's back! Daddy's home!

152
00:11:07,537 --> 00:11:10,616
♬爱的孩子们
♪ Allons enfants de la Patrie

153
00:11:10,617 --> 00:11:13,376
♬你的荣耀终将到来!♪
♪ Le jour de gloire est arrive! ♪

154
00:11:13,377 --> 00:11:15,936
早餐!我做饭!
Breakfast! I'm cooking!

155
00:11:15,937 --> 00:11:18,617
谁想吃煎饼?
Who wants pancakes?

156
00:11:37,457 --> 00:11:39,216
早上好!差十分八点。
Morning! It's ten to eight.

157
00:11:39,217 --> 00:11:41,577
是的,我……对不起，我迟到了。
Yes, I... Sorry I'm late.

158
00:11:44,097 --> 00:11:46,497
哦!
Oh!

159
00:11:49,057 --> 00:11:53,296
“星期天早晨的礼拜仪式来自圣詹姆斯大帝教堂……”
'The Sunday morning service comes from the church of St James the Great...'

160
00:11:53,297 --> 00:11:54,857
哦，滚开。
Oh, piss off.

161
00:12:12,897 --> 00:12:14,696
Pa-pa-pa pom !
Pa-pa-pa pom!

162
00:12:14,697 --> 00:12:16,776
你相信上帝吗?
Do you believe in God?

163
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:20,376
我过去常常……相信。
I used to... to believe.

164
00:12:20,377 --> 00:12:22,217
1970年代中后期。
Mid-to-late 1970s.

165
00:12:24,857 --> 00:12:28,336
70年代中后期发生了什么?
What happened in the mid-to-late 1970s?

166
00:12:28,337 --> 00:12:30,576
我不确定。
I'm not sure.

167
00:12:30,577 --> 00:12:35,496
但是,呃…从那时起，我们似乎就不去了。为什么?
But, er... that's when we just seemed to stop going. Why?

168
00:12:35,497 --> 00:12:40,376
我想我更愿意在教堂结婚，而不是在婚姻登记处结婚。
I think I'd like to get married in a church rather than a registry office...

169
00:12:40,377 --> 00:12:42,336
在反思。
on reflection.

170
00:12:42,337 --> 00:12:44,976
是谁在制造噪音?好吧，我们可以。
Who's that making that din? Well, we can do.

171
00:12:44,977 --> 00:12:47,456
我…我不认为这是必须的，
I...I don't think it's obligatory these days,

172
00:12:47,457 --> 00:12:50,697
相信上帝，只是因为你想在教堂结婚。
to believe in God, just cos you want to get wed in church.

173
00:12:55,417 --> 00:12:58,656
你到底在搞什么鬼!早上好,亲爱的。
What the hell on earth do you think you're doing?! Morning, darling.

174
00:12:58,657 --> 00:13:01,176
别把我拉屎了，亲爱的!如厕的嘴。
Don't you shitting well "darling" me! Potty mouth.

175
00:13:01,177 --> 00:13:03,496
你在干什么?早餐。想要一些吗?
What are you doing? Breakfast. Want some?

176
00:13:03,497 --> 00:13:05,136
是约翰吗?她让他进来了吗?
Is that John? Has she let him in?

177
00:13:05,137 --> 00:13:07,216
我住在这里!他是怎么回来的?
I live here! How has he got back?

178
00:13:07,217 --> 00:13:11,456
不，你不住在这里，因为你是个混蛋，我把你赶出去了!
No, you don't live here, because I chucked you out for being an arsehole!

179
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:13,536
是的,嗯…
Yes, well...

180
00:13:13,537 --> 00:13:15,376
这房子有一半是我的!
half this house is mine!

181
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:17,976
我没有做错任何事!她来了!
I wasn't doing anything wrong! She turned up!

182
00:13:17,977 --> 00:13:20,135
威廉夸张!克服它!别碰那个!
William exaggerated! Get over it! Don't you touch that!

183
00:13:20,136 --> 00:13:22,017
下次你妈再扇我耳光，
And next time your mother slaps me,

184
00:13:22,018 --> 00:13:25,976
你告诉她我会立马还给她一巴掌!困难!
you tell her I will slap her right back! Harder!

185
00:13:25,977 --> 00:13:28,736
你不能把我的厨房弄得一团糟!
You are not making a mess in my kitchen!

186
00:13:28,737 --> 00:13:31,656
这是正确的!我把厨房弄得一团糟!
That's right! I'm making a mess in my kitchen!

187
00:13:31,657 --> 00:13:35,736
当你和那个婊子上床的时候你就丧失了任何权利!
You forfeited any right to anything when you went off shagging that whore!

188
00:13:35,737 --> 00:13:38,896
再大声点，卡罗琳!
Shout a little bit louder, Caroline!

189
00:13:38,897 --> 00:13:40,816
这一点都不好笑!不。
It's not funny! No.

190
00:13:40,817 --> 00:13:44,896
道德上，我不能和你争论。然而，在法律上，更多的妥协!
Morally, I can't argue with you. Legally, however, a tad more compromise!

191
00:13:44,897 --> 00:13:46,816
我不想你在这儿!
I do not want you here!

192
00:13:46,817 --> 00:13:50,576
我不介意你在这里。又不是没有地方了，对吧?
Well, I don't mind you being here. It isn't like there isn't room, is it?

193
00:13:50,577 --> 00:13:52,456
所以，如果你不能对我彬彬有礼，
So, if you can't be civil to me,

194
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:54,856
滚到另一个房间去，好吗?
just bugger off into another room, all right?

195
00:13:54,857 --> 00:13:57,217
因为如果你要变得难以相处和不合作，
Because if you're going to be difficult and unco-operative,

196
00:13:57,218 --> 00:14:00,216
我可能会把你的东西都扔掉，好吗?
I might just chuck all your things out, OK?

197
00:14:00,217 --> 00:14:01,736
发生什么事情了?
What's happening?

198
00:14:01,737 --> 00:14:03,257
什么都没有。
Nothing.

199
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:06,976
你爸爸表现得像只猪!
Your father's behaving like a pig!

200
00:14:06,977 --> 00:14:08,857
哦,该死的。她关上了窗户。
Oh, damn. She's shut the window.

201
00:14:09,857 --> 00:14:13,296
你看，我没有表现得像只猪。我愿意完全讲理。
You see, I'm not behaving like a pig. I'm willing to be entirely reasonable.

202
00:14:13,297 --> 00:14:16,137
你在做早餐吗，冰棒?是的，我是。酷。
You're doing breakfast, Popsicle? Yes, I am. Cool.

203
00:14:28,257 --> 00:14:30,377
这一点都不好笑!
It's not funny!

204
00:14:35,377 --> 00:14:37,336
嘿!
Hey!

205
00:14:37,337 --> 00:14:40,217
你想不想开车去巴克斯通岭?
How do you fancy driving over to Buckstones Ridge?

206
00:14:45,537 --> 00:14:48,057
哦……
Oh...

207
00:15:32,457 --> 00:15:33,657
我要去上班了。
I'm just off to work.

208
00:15:35,857 --> 00:15:37,737
拉夫。
Raff.

209
00:16:12,937 --> 00:16:14,056
啊。
Ah.

210
00:16:14,057 --> 00:16:16,096
你对我们的拉夫说了什么?
What have you been saying to our Raff?

211
00:16:16,097 --> 00:16:18,256
冷静点，吉莉安。然后去报警?
Oh, steady on, Gillian. And going to the police?

212
00:16:18,257 --> 00:16:22,216
什么样的人会被16岁的孩子打了还去报警?
What kind of bloke gets beaten up by a 16-year-old and goes whining to the police?

213
00:16:22,217 --> 00:16:24,615
那就说"谢谢你，保罗，没有起诉我"怎么样?
How about, "Thank you, Paul, for not pressing charges"?

214
00:16:24,616 --> 00:16:25,697
你对他说了什么?
What did you say to him?

215
00:16:25,698 --> 00:16:28,216
“谢谢你，保罗，你给了他一个警告。”
"Thank you, Paul, for letting him get off with a caution."

216
00:16:28,217 --> 00:16:30,776
公牛。我只是…你知道的。
Nowt. I were just, like... You know.

217
00:16:30,777 --> 00:16:32,056
怎么啦？
What?

218
00:16:32,057 --> 00:16:34,056
我正说你是个好女人呢。
I were just saying what a fine woman you was.

219
00:16:34,057 --> 00:16:35,696
你这个白痴。任何时候，爱。
You idiot. Any time, love.

220
00:16:35,697 --> 00:16:37,976
反正他也不相信你。哈哈。
Well, he didn't believe you, anyway. Ha-ha.

221
00:16:37,977 --> 00:16:39,936
不，他说了。
Nah, he did.

222
00:16:39,937 --> 00:16:43,496
一开始就不是了，厚脸皮的蠢货。
Not to start with, cheeky git.

223
00:16:43,497 --> 00:16:47,496
直到我描述了你窗户上方潮湿的墙纸都在剥落。
Not till I described the way your wallpaper's peeling off above t'window where it's damp.

224
00:16:47,497 --> 00:16:49,776
还有你那双价值五百万的鞋子。
And your five million pair of shoes.

225
00:16:49,777 --> 00:16:53,456
他床边的那张照片是他，他的叔叔Robbie和他的爸爸。
And that photo he has by his bed of him, his Uncle Robbie and his dad.

226
00:16:53,457 --> 00:16:55,776
是啊，我想他那时才意识到
Yeah, yeah, I think that's when he realised

227
00:16:55,777 --> 00:16:58,216
我真的去过你的楼上。
I really had been in your upstairs.

228
00:16:58,217 --> 00:17:01,057
他疯了。Lickle混蛋。
He went mad. Lickle bastard.

229
00:17:07,817 --> 00:17:09,497
这是……
That's...

230
00:18:13,097 --> 00:18:15,656
喂?吉莉安吗?
Hello? Gillian?

231
00:18:15,657 --> 00:18:18,656
是吗?我是约翰·艾略特。
Yeah? It's John Elliot.

232
00:18:18,657 --> 00:18:20,096
卡洛琳的丈夫。
Caroline's husband.

233
00:18:20,097 --> 00:18:22,096
哦。
Oh.

234
00:18:22,097 --> 00:18:25,416
约翰。
John.

235
00:18:25,417 --> 00:18:27,016
你好。
Hello.

236
00:18:27,017 --> 00:18:30,216
我打电话是想谢谢你昨晚收留我。
I'm just ringing to say thank you for putting me up last night.

237
00:18:30,217 --> 00:18:31,576
噢,那是……
Oh, that's...

238
00:18:31,577 --> 00:18:35,296
我为自己辩护，然后…嗯，她不喜欢。
I stuck up for myself, and, er... well, she didn't like it.

239
00:18:35,297 --> 00:18:37,176
毫不奇怪。
Not surprisingly.

240
00:18:37,177 --> 00:18:39,016
但我做到了。
But I did it.

241
00:18:39,017 --> 00:18:42,216
他在跟人说话。
He's talking to someone.

242
00:18:42,217 --> 00:18:45,296
“谁?”我不知道。他傻笑。
'Who?' I've got no idea. He's smirking.

243
00:18:45,297 --> 00:18:47,416
可能是她，朱蒂丝。
It's probably her, Judith.

244
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:51,256
我不知道，卡洛琳对不起，我惹你生气了。
Well, I've no idea, Caroline. I'm sorry I upset you.

245
00:18:51,257 --> 00:18:55,177
对不起，我没听你的。你是对的。他是个绝对的……
I'm sorry I didn't listen to you. You were right. He's an absolute...

246
00:18:56,457 --> 00:18:59,096
混蛋。我度过了人生中最美好的时光
jerk. I've spent the best years of my life

247
00:18:59,097 --> 00:19:02,176
嫁给了一个不靠谱，肤浅的…
married to an unreliable, shallow-minded...

248
00:19:02,177 --> 00:19:04,137
以自我为中心…
self-centred...

249
00:19:05,377 --> 00:19:06,977
混蛋。
jerk.

250
00:19:09,017 --> 00:19:10,056
是的。
Yes.

251
00:19:10,057 --> 00:19:12,136
我该怎么办呢?
What am I going to do?

252
00:19:12,137 --> 00:19:14,577
跟他离婚，这次别光说说而已。
Divorce him, and not just talk about it this time.

253
00:19:14,578 --> 00:19:17,136
卖掉房子，平分所有财产。重新开始。
Sell the house, split everything. Start again.

254
00:19:17,137 --> 00:19:19,696
我不能卖这房子!“为什么?”
I can't sell this house! 'Why?'

255
00:19:19,697 --> 00:19:24,016
因为我……我为此付出了很多。我为此付出了那么多努力。
Because I... I've put so much into it. I've worked so hard for it.

256
00:19:24,017 --> 00:19:26,896
它是完美的。我不想卖……
It's perfect. I don't want to sell...

257
00:19:26,897 --> 00:19:28,857
不管怎样，我不能，因为我妈妈……
Anyway, I can't, because my mother...

258
00:19:28,858 --> 00:19:32,976
事实上，我妈妈可能要搬出去了，因为她要结婚了。
Actually, my mother's probably going to move out, because she's getting married.

259
00:19:32,977 --> 00:19:35,096
你的母亲吗?是的。
Your mother? Yes.

260
00:19:35,097 --> 00:19:38,256
你妈妈要结婚了?谁来?
Your mother is getting married? Who to?

261
00:19:38,257 --> 00:19:40,297
哦，只是…
Oh, it's just...

262
00:19:42,657 --> 00:19:43,697
多么甜蜜。
How sweet.

263
00:19:49,257 --> 00:19:50,857
你想让我过去吗?
Would you like me to come round?

264
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:55,497
“你想去散散步吗?”你想做点什么吗?”
'Would you like to go for a walk? Would you like to do something?'

265
00:19:57,177 --> 00:19:59,337
可能是我说得太多了……
Me going on about stuff a bit too much, probably...

266
00:20:01,217 --> 00:20:04,497
你住的地方真是世界上最美丽的地方。
That's such a beautiful part of the world that you live in.

267
00:20:06,257 --> 00:20:07,976
约翰?约翰,约翰。
John? John, John.

268
00:20:07,977 --> 00:20:10,337
我…我很抱歉。我得走了，因为我在工作。
I'm... I'm sorry. I've got to go, cos I'm at work.

269
00:20:10,338 --> 00:20:12,616
哦，对不起。是的,不…没有问题。
Oh, I'm sorry. Yeah, no... no problem.

270
00:20:12,617 --> 00:20:14,256
那么,再见。我变得抒情起来。
Ta-ta, then. Me waxing lyrical.

271
00:20:14,257 --> 00:20:16,216
是的。哦。再见!
Yeah. Aw. Bye!

272
00:20:16,217 --> 00:20:19,416
也许什么时候能再见到你。是的,是的。
Probably see you again some time anyway. Yeah, yep.

273
00:20:19,417 --> 00:20:21,577
再见。再见。再见。
Bye. Bye-bye. Bye.

274
00:20:26,937 --> 00:20:29,777
可爱的外来生物。
Sweet exotic creature.

275
00:20:41,817 --> 00:20:43,257
“那么，2点怎么样?”
'So, 2 o'clock, then?'

276
00:20:45,977 --> 00:20:47,816
耶稣基督。
Jesus Christ.

277
00:20:47,817 --> 00:20:51,296
他点燃了一支香烟。“那很……”
He's lit a cigarette. 'Is that very...'

278
00:20:51,297 --> 00:20:53,336
这有多糟糕?
How bad is that?

279
00:20:53,337 --> 00:20:54,617
我们不抽烟。
We don't smoke.

280
00:20:54,618 --> 00:20:56,616
哦。啊。
Oh. Ah.

281
00:20:56,617 --> 00:21:00,176
他在早上11点15分喝威士忌。
And he's drinking whisky at quarter-past 11 in the morning.

282
00:21:00,177 --> 00:21:02,776
他在听…该死的弓箭手!
And he's listening to the... bloody Archers!

283
00:21:02,777 --> 00:21:03,817
我得走了。
I've got to go.

284
00:21:04,937 --> 00:21:07,057
好吧，那我们……
Right, well, I'll see you at...

285
00:21:23,977 --> 00:21:26,536
你这个傻婊子!
You silly bitch!

286
00:21:26,537 --> 00:21:29,496
你觉得你给孩子们树立了什么样的榜样?
What kind of example do you think you set these boys, hm?

287
00:21:29,497 --> 00:21:34,176
吸烟!喝酒和私通!
Smoking! And drinking and fornicating!

288
00:21:34,177 --> 00:21:38,256
在那里打滚，就像…放纵的傻帽!
And wallowing there like some... self-indulgent tosser!

289
00:21:38,257 --> 00:21:41,096
你怎么敢这么做?我不想你在这儿!
How dare you do that? I do not want you here!

290
00:21:41,097 --> 00:21:46,776
嗯，运气不好。我住在这里，如果我想抽烟，想带女人来，那我就带!
Well, bad luck. I live here, and if I want to smoke and bring women here, then I'll bring them!

291
00:21:46,777 --> 00:21:48,976
但我不想带女人来这里!
But I don't want to bring women here!

292
00:21:48,977 --> 00:21:51,776
因为我想让我们的婚姻继续下去!
Because I want our marriage to work!

293
00:21:51,777 --> 00:21:54,576
你这个疯子!这段婚姻结束了!
You mad cow! This marriage is over!

294
00:21:54,577 --> 00:21:58,456
它死了!这是多余的!它……从来没有!
It is dead! It is redundant! It... it never was!

295
00:21:58,457 --> 00:22:01,136
我不想再浪费生命中的一秒
And I do not want to waste another second of my life

296
00:22:01,137 --> 00:22:03,457
假装它是值得拯救的东西!
pretending it's something worth saving!

297
00:22:06,497 --> 00:22:09,696
♬你怀里的静电
♪ The static from your arms

298
00:22:09,697 --> 00:22:13,056
♬它是一种催化剂
♪ It is a catalyst

299
00:22:13,057 --> 00:22:16,536
♬你是一种燃烧的化学物质
♪ You're a chemical that burns

300
00:22:16,537 --> 00:22:20,177
♬没有什么比这更好的了。♪
♪ There is nothing like this. ♪

301
00:22:21,377 --> 00:22:23,976
如果几周前有人告诉我的话
If anybody had told me a few weeks ago

302
00:22:23,977 --> 00:22:27,096
我会坐在巴克斯通岭
that I'd be sitting up at Buckstones Ridge,

303
00:22:27,097 --> 00:22:31,096
和一个不是我丈夫的男人牵手，
holding hands with a man who isn't my husband,

304
00:22:31,097 --> 00:22:33,856
他开着他的雷克萨斯开车送我过来
and who's just driven me here in his Lexus,

305
00:22:33,857 --> 00:22:36,776
我还以为他们在跟我开玩笑呢。
I'd have thought they were pulling my leg.

306
00:22:36,777 --> 00:22:39,016
我也不会坐在任何地方
Not that I'd have ever sat anywhere

307
00:22:39,017 --> 00:22:41,577
和我的丈夫手牵手。
holding hands with a man who was my husband.

308
00:22:42,657 --> 00:22:45,656
肯尼斯不是那种乐于助人的人。
Kenneth wasn't the hand-holding sort.

309
00:22:45,657 --> 00:22:49,216
我是说，在麻烦出现之前，
I mean, even before the trouble,

310
00:22:49,217 --> 00:22:53,376
我不认为他有浪漫的天性。
I don't think he'd a romantic bone in his body.

311
00:22:53,377 --> 00:22:56,936
后来，当我发现他是个多么好色的家伙时，嗯……
And then after, when I'd found out what a randy sod he'd been, well...

312
00:22:56,937 --> 00:23:02,177
把锡盖放在任何一种…任何类似浪漫的东西。
that put the tin lid on any sort of... Anything resembling romantic.

313
00:23:03,857 --> 00:23:07,456
我是说，我不再和他交往了。
I mean, I stopped going anywhere with him socially.

314
00:23:07,457 --> 00:23:10,057
我是说，他不知道谁知道谁不知道。
I mean, he didn't know who knew and who didn't.

315
00:23:11,497 --> 00:23:15,496
我的工作原则是做最坏的打算永远是明智的。
And I work on the principle it's always wise to assume the worst.

316
00:23:15,497 --> 00:23:17,616
我是说，这样不好，对吧?
I mean, it's not nice, is it?

317
00:23:17,617 --> 00:23:21,136
大家互相推搡，说:“哦，是她。
Folk nudging each other, going, "Ooh, that's her

318
00:23:21,137 --> 00:23:25,336
她丈夫背着她干这事。
"whose husband's at it with all and sundry behind her back.

319
00:23:25,337 --> 00:23:27,696
“我不知道她是否知道，可怜的婊子。
"I wonder if she knows, poor bitch.

320
00:23:27,697 --> 00:23:31,457
“我想知道她没做什么，让他把目光投向别处。”
"I wonder what she's not doing that's making him look elsewhere."

321
00:23:32,977 --> 00:23:34,857
所以，你进去了。你不出去。
So, you stop in. You don't go out.

322
00:23:38,017 --> 00:23:39,657
你的世界变得越来越小。
And your world gets smaller.

323
00:23:41,737 --> 00:23:43,337
我应该和他离婚的。
I should have divorced him.

324
00:23:44,577 --> 00:23:46,696
但说起来容易，有个孩子要抚养
But it's easy to say, with a child to bring up

325
00:23:46,697 --> 00:23:50,096
而且没有自己的钱。你看，我没有工作。
and no money of your own. And you see, I'd not worked.

326
00:23:50,097 --> 00:23:51,856
我没有事业。
I had no career.

327
00:23:51,857 --> 00:23:54,896
卡洛琳出生时我就放弃了工作。
I'd given up my job when Caroline was born.

328
00:23:54,897 --> 00:23:56,897
在那个时代，女人是这样做的。
Women did in them days.

329
00:23:59,617 --> 00:24:01,657
有一次可能会杀了他。
Could have killed him one time.

330
00:24:03,057 --> 00:24:04,937
我是说，真的，我可以!
I mean, literally, I could have!

331
00:24:06,857 --> 00:24:08,936
他正在装饰厨房。
He was decorating the kitchen.

332
00:24:08,937 --> 00:24:11,937
把天花板漆成一个小梯子。
Painting the ceiling up a little stepladder.

333
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:15,977
他对自己动手做任何事都一窍不通。
He was hopeless at anything to do with DIY.

334
00:24:17,977 --> 00:24:20,257
总之，他滑倒了，撞到了头。
Anyway, he slipped and banged his head.

335
00:24:21,817 --> 00:24:26,576
他一定是出去了……不会超过一两秒钟的。
He must have been out for... oh, well, no more than a second or two.

336
00:24:26,577 --> 00:24:28,376
当然，我慌了。
But of course, I panicked.

337
00:24:28,377 --> 00:24:30,457
直到他醒过来。
Till he came to.

338
00:24:31,457 --> 00:24:34,217
直到后来我才意识到我的反应太慢了。
It was only afterwards I realised I'd been slow.

339
00:24:35,617 --> 00:24:39,136
我决定，如果这种事再发生，我就在他脸上塞个垫子
And I decided if it ever happened again I'd slip a cushion over his face

340
00:24:39,137 --> 00:24:40,937
然后让他窒息。
and suffocate him.

341
00:24:47,097 --> 00:24:48,496
我吓到你了吗?
Have I shocked you?

342
00:24:48,497 --> 00:24:50,457
不。
No.

343
00:24:52,497 --> 00:24:54,496
哦,上帝。
Oh, God.

344
00:24:54,497 --> 00:24:56,696
很抱歉我一直在说他。
I'm sorry I go on about him.

345
00:24:56,697 --> 00:25:02,057
不，不，不。我只是很抱歉你…你必须经历这一切。
No, no, no, no. I'm just sorry you... you had it to go through.

346
00:25:03,577 --> 00:25:07,737
我告诉你这些只是想让你知道你要娶的是一个什么样的女人。
I'm only telling you this so you know what sort of a woman you're marrying.

347
00:25:09,297 --> 00:25:12,017
你想去酒吧喝一杯吗?
Do you fancy a pint in a pub?

348
00:25:13,697 --> 00:25:15,217
我在想……哦,啊?
I was thinking... Oh, aye?

349
00:25:16,777 --> 00:25:19,097
你今晚为何不在哈罗盖特停留?
Why don't you stop tonight in Harrogate?

350
00:25:20,897 --> 00:25:23,816
哦，我没有什么不愉快的意思。
Oh, I don't mean anything untoward.

351
00:25:23,817 --> 00:25:25,057
我有一间空房。
I've got a spare room.

352
00:25:25,058 --> 00:25:31,136
不过不然的话，带我回哈罗盖特对你来说会是一段漫长的旅程
Only it's going to be a long haul for you otherwise, taking me back to Harrogate

353
00:25:31,137 --> 00:25:33,136
然后出发去哈利法克斯。
then setting off to Halifax.

354
00:25:33,137 --> 00:25:35,897
你今天天刚亮就起床了。
And you were up at the crack of dawn this morning.

355
00:25:38,697 --> 00:25:40,657
我得买把牙刷。
I'd have to buy a toothbrush.

356
00:25:56,217 --> 00:25:57,817
拉夫?
Raff?

357
00:26:01,337 --> 00:26:02,777
Raffy吗?
Raffy?

358
00:26:23,777 --> 00:26:26,376
回答。
Answer it.

359
00:26:26,377 --> 00:26:29,736
“我不能接你的电话。请留言，我会给你回电话的。”
'I can't take your call. Leave a message and I'll ring you back.'

360
00:26:29,737 --> 00:26:31,576
拉夫，是我。
Raff, it's me.

361
00:26:31,577 --> 00:26:34,896
你在哪里?打电话给我或者…或者给我发短信。
Where are you? Just ring me or... or text me.

362
00:26:34,897 --> 00:26:36,337
我…我要知道你在哪里。
I...I need to know where you are.

363
00:26:38,257 --> 00:26:41,496
如果我让你不高兴了，我很抱歉。我知道我让你不高兴了。
I'm sorry if I've upset you. I know I've upset you.

364
00:26:41,497 --> 00:26:43,777
但我得知道你没事。
But I need to know that you're all right.

365
00:27:01,817 --> 00:27:04,177
哦,狗屎。
Oh, shit.

366
00:27:14,017 --> 00:27:15,816
吉莉安吗?拉夫和你在一起吗?
Gillian? Is Raff with you?

367
00:27:15,817 --> 00:27:17,456
是的。
He is, yeah.

368
00:27:17,457 --> 00:27:20,656
他还好吗?
Is he all right?

369
00:27:20,657 --> 00:27:22,417
是的，他很好。
Yeah, he's absolutely fine.

370
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:27,496
他说了什么?什么都没有。
What's he said? Nothing.

371
00:27:27,497 --> 00:27:31,096
我能跟他谈谈吗?他现在有点忙。他在玩Xbox。
Well, can I talk to him? He's a bit busy at the minute. He's on the Xbox.

372
00:27:31,097 --> 00:27:32,896
是吗?把他从床上弄下来…
Yeah? Well, get him off the f...

373
00:27:32,897 --> 00:27:37,136
坦白说，我觉得他不会想和你谈的。我不知道发生了什么
And to be frank I don't think he'd want to talk with you. I don't know what's happened,

374
00:27:37,137 --> 00:27:40,096
除了他和那个白痴打架，但我想肯定有事发生了。
other than him fighting with that dickhead, but I assume something has.

375
00:27:40,097 --> 00:27:43,496
我猜他终于明白了你是一个多么疯狂的婊子，
I assume that he's finally seen the light and worked out what a mad bitch you are,

376
00:27:43,497 --> 00:27:47,616
所以，如果他想搬来住，我没意见。
so you know, if he wants to move in here, that's fine by me.

377
00:27:47,617 --> 00:27:52,056
我不会强行把他关在这里。你竟敢向他灌输我的坏话。
I'm not keeping him here by force. Don't you dare fill his head with rubbish about me.

378
00:27:52,057 --> 00:27:55,417
那么，就这些了吗?你让他给我打电话!
Will that be everything, then? You just tell him to ring me!

379
00:28:29,537 --> 00:28:31,136
喂?约翰?
Hello? John?

380
00:28:31,137 --> 00:28:32,297
是吗?吉莉安。
Yeah? It's Gillian.

381
00:28:33,657 --> 00:28:34,897
艾伦的女儿。
Alan's daughter.

382
00:28:37,217 --> 00:28:38,536
吉莉安。
Gillian.

383
00:28:38,537 --> 00:28:41,496
对不起，我今天早上不得不挂断电话。
Sorry I had to ring off this morning.

384
00:28:41,497 --> 00:28:43,976
只有老板紧盯着我，而且……
Only the boss were breathing down my neck and...

385
00:28:43,977 --> 00:28:46,496
不，不，那是……我没多想。
No, no, that's... I thought nothing of it.

386
00:28:46,497 --> 00:28:47,696
好,好。
Good, good.

387
00:28:47,697 --> 00:28:49,817
好。事情进展如何?
Good. So, how's things progressing?

388
00:28:52,457 --> 00:28:55,936
她在花园里开了个小集会
Oh, she's having a little coven in the garden

389
00:28:55,937 --> 00:28:58,017
和一个和她一起工作的无聊的小女巫。
with some insipid little witch that she works with.

390
00:28:58,018 --> 00:28:59,776
好了。
Nice.

391
00:28:59,777 --> 00:29:04,416
劳伦斯说她是女同性恋。天知道卡洛琳为什么邀请她来。
Lawrence says she's a lesbian. God knows why Caroline's invited her here.

392
00:29:04,417 --> 00:29:06,296
你知道你昨晚说了什么
You know what you said last night

393
00:29:06,297 --> 00:29:09,977
关于你和这个…
about you having this affair with this...

394
00:29:11,217 --> 00:29:12,257
朱迪思?
Judith?

395
00:29:14,577 --> 00:29:17,417
是吗?嗯…
Yeah? Well...

396
00:29:20,857 --> 00:29:22,697
我也做过类似的事情……
I did something similar and...

397
00:29:23,857 --> 00:29:25,937
你做了吗?是的,…
You did? Yeah, a...

398
00:29:27,297 --> 00:29:28,737
愚蠢，愚蠢的事情。
stupid, stupid thing.

399
00:29:31,417 --> 00:29:34,976
拉夫发现了，所以才会吵起来，
And Raff's found out, and that's what that fight was about,

400
00:29:34,977 --> 00:29:36,776
他去跟罗比住了
and he's gone to live with Robbie.

401
00:29:36,777 --> 00:29:40,056
那是他的叔叔，警察。
That's his uncle, the policeman.

402
00:29:40,057 --> 00:29:42,417
他是个十足的混蛋……
And he's a right bastard and...

403
00:29:45,777 --> 00:29:47,296
胡说!
Bollocks!

404
00:29:47,297 --> 00:29:50,136
我和理查德离婚的时候也是这样。
It was exactly the same when me and Richard got divorced.

405
00:29:50,137 --> 00:29:52,217
我们都没钱买下对方的股份
Neither of us could afford to buy the other one out

406
00:29:52,218 --> 00:29:54,616
所以我们不得不卖掉所有的东西。
so we had to sell up, split everything.

407
00:29:54,617 --> 00:29:58,496
就在中间。我们的房子很漂亮。
Right down the middle. Beautiful house we had.

408
00:29:58,497 --> 00:30:00,656
这让人心碎。
It was heartbreaking.

409
00:30:00,657 --> 00:30:03,336
但你会找到前进的道路。
But you find a way forward.

410
00:30:03,337 --> 00:30:05,897
我得去找个合适的法律顾问。
I'm going to have to get proper legal advice.

411
00:30:07,457 --> 00:30:09,977
是的,很明显。我不知道我在说什么。
Yes, obviously. I don't know what I'm talking about.

412
00:30:11,857 --> 00:30:16,096
你不?我是在讽刺你。我只是说我也经历过同样的事情，
Don't you? I was being sarcastic. I just said I've been through exactly the same thing,

413
00:30:16,097 --> 00:30:19,777
但是，是的，你应该得到适当的法律建议。你为什么这么无礼?为什么?
but, yes, you should get proper legal advice. Why are you being so snippy? Why?

414
00:30:21,497 --> 00:30:22,537
怎么啦？
What?

415
00:30:26,657 --> 00:30:29,897
我爸爸得了老年痴呆症。你知道吗?
My dad's got Alzheimer's. Did you know that?

416
00:30:31,297 --> 00:30:32,736
天啊，我很抱歉。
God, I'm so sorry.

417
00:30:32,737 --> 00:30:36,537
关于我，你不知道的事太多了，卡洛琳
There's a million and one things you don't know about me, Caroline...

418
00:30:37,617 --> 00:30:40,896
因为你从不开口，我也尽量不给别人添麻烦
cos you never ask, and I try not to inflict things on people

419
00:30:40,897 --> 00:30:42,976
除非我觉得他们真的感兴趣
unless I think they're actually interested,

420
00:30:42,977 --> 00:30:45,137
但我从来没觉得你是
but I've never really had the impression that you were,

421
00:30:45,138 --> 00:30:47,656
但你却想当然地认为我会对你感兴趣。
but you just take it for granted that I'll be interested in you.

422
00:30:47,657 --> 00:30:49,976
你不?是你主动提出要过来的。
Don't you? You offered to come round.

423
00:30:49,977 --> 00:30:52,776
但是你给我打电话了。
Mm, but you rang me up.

424
00:30:52,777 --> 00:30:55,136
在你甩了我之后。嘘。
After you'd dumped me. Shh.

425
00:30:55,137 --> 00:30:59,016
你给我打电话希望我能同情你，我确实同情你。
You rang me up expecting me to be sympathetic, which I am.

426
00:30:59,017 --> 00:31:02,176
那对我也没什么好处。然后你就像个男人了。
Not that it'll do me any good. And then you're like a man.

427
00:31:02,177 --> 00:31:05,136
你就这么决定了，我都不知道
You just make this decision that I haven't got a clue

428
00:31:05,137 --> 00:31:07,617
我在说什么，尽管我也经历过。
what I'm talking about even though I've been through it.

429
00:31:07,618 --> 00:31:11,656
我觉得你反应过度了。你在阅读……然后上周又来找我
I think you're overreacting. You're reading things... And then having a go at me last week

430
00:31:11,657 --> 00:31:14,736
在我为所发生的事难过的时候告诉别人
for talking to someone when I was upset about what had happened.

431
00:31:14,737 --> 00:31:17,376
一个有同情心和兴趣的人。
Someone who was sympathetic and interested.

432
00:31:17,377 --> 00:31:20,096
迈克尔·多布森?他试图勒索我。
Michael bloody Dobson? He tried to blackmail me.

433
00:31:20,097 --> 00:31:22,777
他没有。你最好走吧。
He didn't. You'd better go.

434
00:31:25,177 --> 00:31:26,377
我被解雇了吗?
Am I being dismissed?

435
00:31:26,378 --> 00:31:28,937
我不应该给你打电话。对不起，我说了。
I shouldn't have rang you up. I'm sorry I did.

436
00:31:31,097 --> 00:31:32,377
别这么说。
Don't say that.

437
00:31:34,377 --> 00:31:36,097
我只是想让你明白…
I just want you to understand...

438
00:31:38,857 --> 00:31:43,577
你对我的影响。
the effect you have on me.

439
00:31:46,137 --> 00:31:50,256
如果你给我打电话，我就跑过来，尽管我知道你对我并不是真的感兴趣。
If you ring me, I'll run round here, even though I know you're not really interested in me.

440
00:31:50,257 --> 00:31:55,737
我不是…对你不感兴趣。
I'm not... not interested in you.

441
00:31:57,497 --> 00:31:58,537
我…
I'm...

442
00:32:01,177 --> 00:32:02,697
我不知道我是什么。我…
I don't know what I am. I...

443
00:32:04,577 --> 00:32:07,736
你说得对，我从没问过你的事，
You're right, I've never asked you anything about you,

444
00:32:07,737 --> 00:32:09,776
不是因为我不…
and it's not because I don't...

445
00:32:09,777 --> 00:32:13,177
那是因为我自私，没有希望……
It's because I'm selfish and hopeless...

446
00:32:14,617 --> 00:32:18,216
你一直是我的好朋友，而我不知道该怎么做一个好朋友。
and you've been a really good friend, and I don't know how to be a good friend.

447
00:32:18,217 --> 00:32:20,337
在任何人身上。
To anyone.

448
00:32:22,817 --> 00:32:24,816
我父母合不来。
My parents never got on.

449
00:32:24,817 --> 00:32:27,936
我和这些人在自己的房子里长大
I grew up in a house on my own with these people

450
00:32:27,937 --> 00:32:30,696
除非万不得已，他们从不说话，
who never spoke to each other unless they had to,

451
00:32:30,697 --> 00:32:32,576
我以为这很正常
and I thought that was normal.

452
00:32:32,577 --> 00:32:35,536
现在她遇到了一个叫艾伦的家伙，他是个好人，
And now she's met this bloke, this Alan, and he's a sweet man,

453
00:32:35,537 --> 00:32:38,216
他把她看得很重，她也把他看得很重，
and he thinks the world of her, and she thinks the world of him,

454
00:32:38,217 --> 00:32:40,297
她是如此的与众不同!
and she's so different!

455
00:32:42,657 --> 00:32:46,016
我忍不住想知道她是否爱上了我爸爸
And I can't help wondering if she'd been in love with my dad

456
00:32:46,017 --> 00:32:48,257
他曾经爱过她……
and he'd been in love with her...

457
00:32:49,617 --> 00:32:51,937
事情会变得多么不同。
how different things would have been.

458
00:32:53,497 --> 00:32:56,696
我不知道正常的关系是什么样的。
I don't know what normal relationships are like.

459
00:32:56,697 --> 00:32:59,777
我看到了，但我不知道怎么做。
I see them, but I don't know how to do them.

460
00:33:01,657 --> 00:33:03,616
所以我很抱歉。
So I'm sorry.

461
00:33:03,617 --> 00:33:08,017
如果我伤害了你或者不把你当回事，我很抱歉。
I'm sorry if I've hurt you or taken you for granted.

462
00:33:09,377 --> 00:33:12,296
我将尽力不那样做……
I will endeavour not to do that...

463
00:33:12,297 --> 00:33:14,097
在未来。
in the future.

464
00:33:17,177 --> 00:33:19,577
因为我很珍惜你的友谊
Because I do value your friendship and...

465
00:33:21,737 --> 00:33:25,377
我很抱歉，如果我从来没有说清楚或做过什么…
I'm sorry if I've never said or made that clear or done what...

466
00:33:27,257 --> 00:33:30,297
正常人都是这样做的。
normal people do to express these things.

467
00:33:32,737 --> 00:33:33,777
我很抱歉。
So, I'm sorry.

468
00:33:36,177 --> 00:33:37,217
谢谢你！
Thank you.

469
00:33:42,777 --> 00:33:46,496
我觉得你该让自己休息一下，吉莉安，真的。
I think you've got to give yourself a break, Gillian, I really do.

470
00:33:46,497 --> 00:33:48,816
他16岁了。给他一个星期的时间。
He's 16 years old. Give him a week.

471
00:33:48,817 --> 00:33:51,336
让他用Robbie的微波炉煮一个星期。
Give him a week with Robbie's microwave cooking.

472
00:33:51,337 --> 00:33:54,976
给罗比一周时间，让他和一个该死的少年待在家里。你是对的。
Give Robbie a week with a bloody teenager in the house. You're right.

473
00:33:54,977 --> 00:33:58,176
你知道他在哪儿。你知道他很安全。好吧，他受了惊吓。
You know where he is. You know he's safe. OK, he's had a shock.

474
00:33:58,177 --> 00:34:01,096
他发现他妈妈有性行为了。克服它吧。
He's found out his mother has sex. Get over it.

475
00:34:01,097 --> 00:34:03,216
我知道，我知道。这就是生活，你知道吗?
I know, I know. It's just life, you know?

476
00:34:03,217 --> 00:34:05,656
他必须意识到你…
And he has to realise that you have...

477
00:34:05,657 --> 00:34:07,936
你知道，就像其他人一样，
you know, just like everyone else does,

478
00:34:07,937 --> 00:34:09,856
冲动,感情,
urges, feelings,

479
00:34:09,857 --> 00:34:11,537
等他长大了，他会明白的。
and when he's an adult, he'll get it.

480
00:34:11,538 --> 00:34:14,336
他不会回头看你，对你评头论足。
He will not look back on you and make judgments.

481
00:34:14,337 --> 00:34:18,216
他只是需要一点时间。退后，吉莉安。
He just needs a little bit of time. Step back from it, Gillian.

482
00:34:18,217 --> 00:34:19,736
我知道这不容易。
I know it's not easy.

483
00:34:19,737 --> 00:34:21,496
他是你的孩子，但是，
He's your boy, but,

484
00:34:21,497 --> 00:34:22,937
如果你能……是的,是的。
if you can... Yeah, yeah.

485
00:34:26,577 --> 00:34:28,656
是的，你说得对，你说得对。
Yeah, you're right, you're right.

486
00:34:28,657 --> 00:34:30,697
哦,孩子。
Oh, kids.

487
00:34:35,017 --> 00:34:37,457
天啊。
Gosh.

488
00:34:38,657 --> 00:34:40,457
花园里的事情怎么样了?
So, how's things in the garden?

489
00:34:43,017 --> 00:34:45,377
哦，差不多一样。
Oh, much the same.

490
00:35:40,497 --> 00:35:41,897
哦,上帝!
Oh, God!

491
00:35:43,817 --> 00:35:45,897
保罗。耶稣。
Paul. Jesus.

492
00:35:49,057 --> 00:35:51,497
发生了什么事?保罗?怎么啦？
What's happened? Paul? What?

493
00:35:53,337 --> 00:35:54,776
这是谁干的?
Who did this?

494
00:35:54,777 --> 00:35:58,256
谁干的?是拉夫吗?
Who did it? Was it Raff?

495
00:35:58,257 --> 00:36:00,297
罗比吗?
Robbie?

496
00:36:02,217 --> 00:36:04,697
好的。来吧。
OK. Come on.

497
00:36:05,817 --> 00:36:07,057
我带你进去。
Let's get you inside.

498
00:36:32,497 --> 00:36:34,577
我觉得我们应该带你去见皇家公主。
I think we should get you up to the Princess Royal.

499
00:36:34,578 --> 00:36:36,257
我会没事的。
I'll be all right.

500
00:36:41,417 --> 00:36:42,497
发生了什么事?
What happened?

501
00:36:49,297 --> 00:36:50,337
达伦和加文。
Darren and Gavin.

502
00:36:52,977 --> 00:36:55,177
海莉的兄弟们发现了我和你在一起
Hayley's brothers found out I'd been at it with you

503
00:36:55,178 --> 00:36:58,217
所以他们和几个大混蛋打了我。
so them and a couple of big bastards laid into me.

504
00:37:01,817 --> 00:37:04,297
所以,我……我想订婚取消了，是吧?
So, I... I guess the engagement's off, eh?!

505
00:37:05,377 --> 00:37:07,937
你这个肮脏的家伙。
You dirty sod.

506
00:37:12,337 --> 00:37:15,977
他们说要往我身上倒汽油，然后把我点着。
They said they was going to pour petrol over me and set me on fire.

507
00:37:18,057 --> 00:37:20,657
我相信了他们。
I believed them.

508
00:37:35,537 --> 00:37:38,017
让奶奶进来。
Let Granny in.

509
00:37:41,377 --> 00:37:42,857
谢谢。
Thanks.

510
00:37:45,137 --> 00:37:48,136
早上好!嗨。
Morning! Hi.

511
00:37:48,137 --> 00:37:51,056
只是想让你知道…哦，你真聪明。
Just to let you know... Oh, you're very smart.

512
00:37:51,057 --> 00:37:53,136
我和艾伦要去哈利法克斯
Me and Alan are popping over to Halifax

513
00:37:53,137 --> 00:37:55,736
去看看可能的婚礼地点。
to look at possible venues for the wedding.

514
00:37:55,737 --> 00:37:59,856
所以我今晚不会来了。我要和艾伦一起去吉莉安家。
So I won't be here this evening. I'll be stopping over at Gillian's with Alan.

515
00:37:59,857 --> 00:38:01,216
正确的。
Right.

516
00:38:01,217 --> 00:38:04,536
很抱歉这么早过来，但你要去上班，所以……
I'm sorry to pop over so early but you'll be going to work so...

517
00:38:04,537 --> 00:38:07,136
刷牙。我的鞋子在哪里?
Brush your teeth. Where are my shoes?

518
00:38:07,137 --> 00:38:09,256
不管你把它们放在哪里。
Wherever you left them.

519
00:38:09,257 --> 00:38:12,897
他很紧张。他拿到了他的第一篇英语论文。
He's very nervous. He's got his first English paper.

520
00:38:14,337 --> 00:38:16,736
他昨晚来过，艾伦。
He stopped over last night, Alan.

521
00:38:16,737 --> 00:38:19,937
是的，我猜想。我,嗯…看到那辆车了。
Yes, I assumed. I, um... saw the car.

522
00:38:21,377 --> 00:38:24,176
他本来打算睡在空卧室的，但是……
He was going to sleep in the spare bedroom but...

523
00:38:24,177 --> 00:38:27,176
我不知道，一件事接着一件事，
I don't know, one thing led to another,

524
00:38:27,177 --> 00:38:31,376
我有一张双人床，我们要结婚了，所以……
and I've got a double bed and we are getting married so...

525
00:38:31,377 --> 00:38:33,737
我们睡在一张床上。
we shared the same bed.

526
00:38:35,217 --> 00:38:36,457
好的。
OK.

527
00:38:38,657 --> 00:38:41,496
我不知道人们会怎么想。
I don't know what people'll think.

528
00:38:41,497 --> 00:38:44,656
对你有好处。我只是想，“这是怎么回事?”
Well, good for you. I just thought, "What the hell?"

529
00:38:44,657 --> 00:38:46,656
什么人?
What people?

530
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:49,297
我也不在乎任何人。
I don't care. Anyone.

531
00:38:50,497 --> 00:38:52,456
正确的。
Right.

532
00:38:52,457 --> 00:38:56,376
就像我说的，我们又不是不结婚，因为我们已经结婚了，所以…
As I say, it's not as though we're not getting married, cos we are, so...

533
00:38:56,377 --> 00:38:58,256
所以呢?
So?

534
00:38:58,257 --> 00:39:00,656
你不介意吧?我吗?不。
You don't mind? Me? No.

535
00:39:00,657 --> 00:39:01,697
不，当然不是。
No, of course not.

536
00:39:03,657 --> 00:39:06,657
所以…太棒了。
So... It's great.

537
00:39:10,897 --> 00:39:13,536
我说的是性。是的，我知道。
I'm talking about sex. Yes, I realise that.

538
00:39:13,537 --> 00:39:15,416
真是太棒了。
It was marvellous.

539
00:39:15,417 --> 00:39:16,657
我忘记了。
I'd forgotten.

540
00:39:19,617 --> 00:39:22,496
我可以很浪漫，但到了紧要关头，
I can be quite a romantic, when push comes to shove,

541
00:39:22,497 --> 00:39:26,256
你爸可从没欣赏过这一点。你能不能别…?
not that your dad ever appreciated that. Oh, can you not just...?

542
00:39:26,257 --> 00:39:29,656
怎么啦？嗯,这是……哦。我让你难堪了吗?
What? Well, it's... Oh. Have I embarrassed you?

543
00:39:29,657 --> 00:39:32,056
我不需要知道。没事，没事。
I don't need to know. It's fine, it's fine.

544
00:39:32,057 --> 00:39:36,136
不管你做什么，都很好，很好。你是成年人。这是……
Whatever you do, it's fine, it's good. You're adults. It's...

545
00:39:36,137 --> 00:39:38,057
我以为你会为我高兴。
I thought you might be happy for me.

546
00:39:38,058 --> 00:39:41,336
我是。我是!
I am. I am!

547
00:39:41,337 --> 00:39:42,936
我爱你，你知道。
I love you, you know.

548
00:39:42,937 --> 00:39:44,577
我知道你喜欢。
I know you do.

549
00:40:10,737 --> 00:40:13,496
我打不通我们的吉莉安。
I can't get through to our Gillian.

550
00:40:13,497 --> 00:40:17,017
她不接电话什么的。
She's not answering her mobile or anything.

551
00:40:18,337 --> 00:40:19,937
我再给你倒点茶好吗?
Can I get you some more tea?

552
00:40:21,497 --> 00:40:23,616
不,不。不，不，我没事。
No, no. No, no, I'm fine.

553
00:40:23,617 --> 00:40:26,777
另一个鸡蛋吗?不,谢谢。
Another egg? No, thanks.

554
00:40:33,137 --> 00:40:35,016
对不起，你说什么?
Sorry, what did you say?

555
00:40:35,017 --> 00:40:37,137
关于吉莉安的事?
Something about Gillian?

556
00:41:10,617 --> 00:41:12,257
好吧，去哪儿?
Right, where to?

557
00:41:14,337 --> 00:41:16,096
我不能回家。
I can't go home.

558
00:41:16,097 --> 00:41:20,497
我爸爸把我赶出去了，我妈妈说她再也不想见到我了。
My dad's chucked me out and my mam says she never wants to clap eyes on me again.

559
00:41:29,977 --> 00:41:31,417
我不会把拉菲的房间给你的。
I'm not giving you Raffy's room.

560
00:42:56,977 --> 00:42:58,616
喂?
Hello?

561
00:42:58,617 --> 00:43:02,256
约翰?朱迪思。你想要什么?
John? It's Judith. What do you want?

562
00:43:02,257 --> 00:43:04,296
呃…我,嗯…
Er... I, um...

563
00:43:04,297 --> 00:43:06,217
你不应该打这个号码。如果是卡洛琳接的呢?
You shouldn't ring this number. What if Caroline had answered it?

564
00:43:06,218 --> 00:43:07,736
她不是在上班吗?
Isn't she at work?

565
00:43:07,737 --> 00:43:08,977
你想要什么?
What do you want?

566
00:43:08,978 --> 00:43:12,056
你不能借给我一些钱，是吗?
You couldn't lend me some money, could you?

567
00:43:12,057 --> 00:43:16,696
只是房东有点…和我不愉快
It's just that the landlord's getting... unpleasant with me

568
00:43:16,697 --> 00:43:18,816
关于拖欠房租和…
about the rent arrears and...

569
00:43:18,817 --> 00:43:20,696
你会因此受益。
You get benefits for that.

570
00:43:20,697 --> 00:43:23,056
是的,是的。
Yeah, yeah.

571
00:43:23,057 --> 00:43:25,816
问题是……
The thing is...

572
00:43:25,817 --> 00:43:29,176
我已经花了。哦,耶稣。
I've spent it. Oh, Jesus.

573
00:43:29,177 --> 00:43:32,417
你不希望我出现在你家门口，对吧?
And you don't want me turning up on your doorstep, do you?

574
00:43:36,337 --> 00:43:38,856
我小时候肯定在这里待了好几个小时。
I must have spent hours in here when I was a kid.

575
00:43:38,857 --> 00:43:40,296
是啊，我也是。
Yeah, so did I.

576
00:43:40,297 --> 00:43:43,256
我一直试着…哄骗它
I always tried to, er... wangle it

577
00:43:43,257 --> 00:43:48,536
这样我们就能坐在一个我可以凝视你的地方。
so that we'd sit somewhere where I could gaze at you.

578
00:43:48,537 --> 00:43:51,176
你没有吗?你这篇愚蠢的文章。
You didn't? You daft article.

579
00:43:51,177 --> 00:43:53,497
你是唯一让我能忍受的人。
You were the only thing that made it bearable.

580
00:43:54,617 --> 00:43:57,016
我讨厌教堂。
I hated it, church.

581
00:43:57,017 --> 00:44:00,497
我以前很无聊，很痛苦。
I used to get so bored and miserable.

582
00:44:01,857 --> 00:44:02,897
是的,很好。
Yeah, well.

583
00:44:04,137 --> 00:44:08,216
提醒你，这比他们现在的那些快乐的东西要好。
Mind you, it's better than all this happy-clappy stuff they have now.

584
00:44:08,217 --> 00:44:12,096
毫米吗?你要薄荷糖吗?是吗?为什么?至少在开心的时候，
Mm? Do you want a mint? Is it? Why? At least with the happy-clappy stuff,

585
00:44:12,097 --> 00:44:14,456
人们看起来真的很想待在那里。
people actually look like they want to be there.

586
00:44:14,457 --> 00:44:16,816
这是不合适的，不是吗?
Well, it's not proper, is it?

587
00:44:16,817 --> 00:44:19,256
现在葬礼上都有流行歌曲了。
They have pop songs at funerals now.

588
00:44:19,257 --> 00:44:20,937
是吗?那又怎样?
Yeah? So what?

589
00:44:22,217 --> 00:44:24,056
葬礼上的流行歌曲?
Pop songs at funerals?

590
00:44:24,057 --> 00:44:27,896
当我们还是孩子的时候，宗教就是关于控制。
Religion when we were kids was all about control.

591
00:44:27,897 --> 00:44:31,696
它讲的是统治阶级与教会的勾结
It was about the ruling classes being hand in glove with the Church

592
00:44:31,697 --> 00:44:36,497
让那些勤劳的普通人害怕拥有自己的思想。
to keep the ordinary hard-working people terrified of having a mind of their own.

593
00:44:37,577 --> 00:44:38,977
是地狱吗?!不，是的。
Was it hell?! No, it was.

594
00:44:38,978 --> 00:44:41,137
你想想看。
You think about it.

595
00:44:42,937 --> 00:44:44,696
我不想和你争论。
I won't get into a debate.

596
00:44:44,697 --> 00:44:47,656
葬礼上为什么不能放首流行歌曲呢
Why shouldn't you have a pop song at a funeral

597
00:44:47,657 --> 00:44:52,736
如果是你喜欢的东西，对你有意义的东西?
if it's something that you've liked, something that's meant something to you?

598
00:44:52,737 --> 00:44:56,017
流行歌曲是给……迪斯科舞厅，酒吧和社交俱乐部。
Pop songs are for... for discos and pubs and social clubs.

599
00:44:58,857 --> 00:45:00,736
在教堂里你唱赞美诗。
In church you sing hymns.

600
00:45:00,737 --> 00:45:02,056
葬礼上的流行歌曲
Pop songs at funerals

601
00:45:02,057 --> 00:45:07,296
都是普通民众用自己的方式庆祝，
are about ordinary folk celebrating whatever, in their own way,

602
00:45:07,297 --> 00:45:11,456
不接受身居高位的人强加给他们的东西，
not accepting what's inflicted on them by people in high places,

603
00:45:11,457 --> 00:45:14,697
他们只想让所有人都感到恐惧和痛苦。
who just want to keep everybody frightened and miserable.

604
00:45:15,697 --> 00:45:19,336
嗯…
Well...

605
00:45:19,337 --> 00:45:23,857
有些人需要身居高位的人时不时地告诉他们什么是什么。
some people need people in high places to tell them what's what now and again.

606
00:45:25,857 --> 00:45:29,337
下次你要告诉我你投了玛格丽特·撒切尔的票。
You're going to tell me next you voted for Margaret Thatcher.

607
00:45:30,337 --> 00:45:33,896
你不会喜欢迈克尔·富特吧?
Well, you can't have liked Michael Foot?

608
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:35,617
在纪念碑上穿夹克?
In his anorak at the Cenotaph?

609
00:45:37,097 --> 00:45:39,496
一个非常聪明的人，迈克尔·富特。
A very intelligent man, Michael Foot.

610
00:45:39,497 --> 00:45:41,496
他不可能有那么聪明
Oh, he can't have been that intelligent

611
00:45:41,497 --> 00:45:44,936
不然他就不会像个稻草人一样到处走了。
or he wouldn't have gone around looking like a scarecrow.

612
00:45:44,937 --> 00:45:46,937
我不讨厌托尼·布莱尔……哦!
I didn't dislike Tony Blair... Oh!

613
00:45:48,457 --> 00:45:50,656
直到他在伊拉克把票弄脏了。
Until he muckied his ticket in Iraq.

614
00:45:50,657 --> 00:45:54,816
现在，戈登·布朗，有一个饱受诟病的人。
Now, Gordon Brown, there's a much-maligned man.

615
00:45:54,817 --> 00:45:57,416
英国首相戈登•布朗(Gordon Brown) ?毫米。
Gordon Brown? Mm.

616
00:45:57,417 --> 00:46:01,416
想让每个人都喜欢他，用他虚伪的笑容?
Trying to get everybody to like him, with his phoney grin?

617
00:46:01,417 --> 00:46:03,456
他是苏格兰人。
And he's Scottish.

618
00:46:03,457 --> 00:46:06,016
现在，这是一个无懈可击的政治论点!
Now, there's an unassailable political argument!

619
00:46:06,017 --> 00:46:08,896
不用说，他把经济搞得一团糟。
Well, it hardly needs pointing out he buggered up the economy.

620
00:46:08,897 --> 00:46:10,336
不，他没有。
No, he didn't.

621
00:46:10,337 --> 00:46:12,976
他没有。他有远见。
He did not. He had vision.

622
00:46:12,977 --> 00:46:16,176
哦,上帝。我知道这是一个我们必须避免的话题。
Oh, God. I can see this is a subject we're going to have to avoid.

623
00:46:16,177 --> 00:46:19,496
不，别担心，我会教你的。你绝对不会的。
No, don't worry, I'll teach you. You damn well won't.

624
00:46:19,497 --> 00:46:21,417
我们会给你买份《卫报》
Yeah, we'll buy you a copy of the Guardian.

625
00:46:21,418 --> 00:46:24,176
你可以保留你的守护者。
You can keep your Guardian.

626
00:46:24,177 --> 00:46:27,976
我好像在你的回收箱里发现了一份《每日邮报》
I thought I spotted a Daily Mail lurking in your recycling bin.

627
00:46:27,977 --> 00:46:30,816
《每日邮报》怎么了?有什么问题吗?
What's wrong with the Daily Mail? What's wrong with it?

628
00:46:30,817 --> 00:46:32,496
它怎么了?
What's right with it?

629
00:46:32,497 --> 00:46:36,216
你知道吗，我从没想过让你参加火热的工党。
Do you know, I'd never have had you down for red-hot Labour.

630
00:46:36,217 --> 00:46:39,456
我以为你有更多的东西。
I thought you had more about you.

631
00:46:39,457 --> 00:46:42,656
你知道大卫·卡梅伦的好处吗
Do you know, the good thing about David Cameron

632
00:46:42,657 --> 00:46:45,736
连他自己都知道自己是个混蛋!
is that even he knows he's an arse!

633
00:46:45,737 --> 00:46:48,576
不，每次他开口，你都能看到他在想，
No, every time he opens his mouth, you can see him thinking,

634
00:46:48,577 --> 00:46:53,496
我生下来是个混蛋，死也会是个混蛋，但至少我知道我是个混蛋
"I was born an arse, I'll die an arse, but at least I know I'm an arse."

635
00:46:53,497 --> 00:46:57,536
你突然变得很粗鲁了，巴特肖先生。
You've suddenly got very coarse, Mr Buttershaw.

636
00:46:57,537 --> 00:47:01,976
那么，你结婚时穿的是什么呢?毫米吗?
So, what will you be walking down the aisle to, then? Mm?

637
00:47:01,977 --> 00:47:05,177
耶路撒冷?统治不列颠?
Jerusalem? Rule Britannia?

638
00:47:07,177 --> 00:47:08,977
示巴女王的到来。
The Arrival Of The Queen Of Sheba.

639
00:47:12,297 --> 00:47:13,337
怎么啦？
What?

640
00:47:15,097 --> 00:47:16,137
怎么啦？
What?

641
00:47:17,857 --> 00:47:19,736
不，不，那是……
No, no, that's...

642
00:47:19,737 --> 00:47:21,856
什么? !
What?!

643
00:47:21,857 --> 00:47:23,257
这是非常合适的!
It's very appropriate!

644
00:47:25,817 --> 00:47:27,817
嗯，我会去的。
Mm, I'd turn up for that.

645
00:47:28,817 --> 00:47:33,696
我知道我得重新教育你了，艾伦·巴特肖。
I can see how I'm going to have to re-educate you, Alan Buttershaw.

646
00:47:33,697 --> 00:47:37,496
这意味着我可以选择我们出去的音乐吗?
Does that mean I get to choose the music we walk out to?

647
00:47:37,497 --> 00:47:39,096
地狱,没有。
Hell, no.

648
00:47:39,097 --> 00:47:40,816
这已经非常明显了
It's become screamingly obvious

649
00:47:40,817 --> 00:47:43,497
我不能再信任你了，就像我可以抛弃你一样。
I can't trust you any further than I could chuck you.

650
00:47:45,777 --> 00:47:47,736
嘿。
Hey.

651
00:47:47,737 --> 00:47:51,016
我忘了我们是在教堂。我们像骑警一样咒骂。
I forgot we're in church. We've been swearing like troopers.

652
00:47:51,017 --> 00:47:53,497
好吧，那我们最好去找牧师。
Well, we'd better find t'vicar, then.

653
00:47:54,937 --> 00:47:56,536
如果这是你想要的。
If this is what you want.

654
00:47:56,537 --> 00:48:00,016
如果你觉得我在压迫大众，那就不是了。
Well, not if you think I'm oppressing the masses.

655
00:48:00,017 --> 00:48:03,656
噢，压迫群众半个小时还是值得的
Oh, it'll be worth oppressing the masses for half an hour or so

656
00:48:03,657 --> 00:48:06,857
看到你像示巴女王一样到来
to see you arriving like the Queen of Sheba.

657
00:48:10,657 --> 00:48:12,616
我希望不是一个女人。
I hope it isn't a woman.

658
00:48:12,617 --> 00:48:14,176
谁?
Who?

659
00:48:14,177 --> 00:48:16,217
教区牧师。
The vicar.

660
00:48:21,537 --> 00:48:25,297
如果你坚持周六的档位，那你就只能看四个……
If you're insisting on a Saturday slot, you're looking at four...

661
00:48:27,937 --> 00:48:29,097
五个月后。
five months away.

662
00:48:31,937 --> 00:48:34,057
我想宜早不宜迟。毫米。
I think sooner rather than later. Mm.

663
00:48:37,017 --> 00:48:38,417
你们俩有谁离婚了吗?
Are either of you divorced?

664
00:48:38,418 --> 00:48:39,457
不。不,不。
No. No, no.

665
00:48:40,857 --> 00:48:42,137
丧偶的。
Widowed.

666
00:48:43,617 --> 00:48:46,497
很明显你们俩都经常去教堂?
And you're both regular churchgoers, obviously?

667
00:48:49,177 --> 00:48:50,897
好吧，我们过去是这样的。
Well, we have been in the past.

668
00:48:53,337 --> 00:48:54,377
嗯。
Hm.

669
00:48:55,977 --> 00:48:59,136
那么，你现在不经常去教堂了?
So, you're not regular churchgoers now?

670
00:48:59,137 --> 00:49:00,977
不是……不。
Not... No.

671
00:49:02,057 --> 00:49:04,497
你上次去教堂是什么时候?
When did you last go to church?

672
00:49:05,777 --> 00:49:07,137
呃…圣诞节吗?
Er... Christmas?

673
00:49:08,177 --> 00:49:10,136
19…噢,呃…
19...oh, er...

674
00:49:10,137 --> 00:49:11,617
77年?
77?

675
00:49:12,697 --> 00:49:15,456
你呢?
What about you,

676
00:49:15,457 --> 00:49:17,976
道森太太吗?差不多一样。
Mrs Dawson? About the same.

677
00:49:17,977 --> 00:49:19,216
毫米。
Mm.

678
00:49:19,217 --> 00:49:23,576
那么，你为什么要上帝的祝福，
So, why do you want God's blessing,

679
00:49:23,577 --> 00:49:25,137
如果你不去教堂?
if you don't go to church?

680
00:49:26,737 --> 00:49:28,937
我只是感兴趣。
I'm just interested.

681
00:49:34,257 --> 00:49:35,857
我们觉得他可能会喜欢这个交易。
We thought he might like the trade.

682
00:49:48,777 --> 00:49:51,776
可怜的贱人!
Miserable bitch!

683
00:49:51,777 --> 00:49:54,417
我是说，难怪人们不去。
I mean, no wonder folk don't go.

684
00:49:56,897 --> 00:49:59,936
哦，我们可以住在灌木丛那边。
Oh, we could live over t'brush.

685
00:49:59,937 --> 00:50:02,576
那你就不是巴特肖太太了。
Ah, but then you wouldn't be Mrs Buttershaw.

686
00:50:02,577 --> 00:50:07,216
不，我想做个派对。我想买一顶帽子。
No, and I fancy having a do. I want to buy a hat.

687
00:50:07,217 --> 00:50:10,696
我们可以再找一个牧师。我打赌他们不都是那样的。
Oh, we could find another vicar. I bet they're not all like that.

688
00:50:10,697 --> 00:50:14,736
不，她让我失望了。就这样了，我和教会。结束的。
No, she's put me off. That's it, now, with me and the Church. End of.

689
00:50:14,737 --> 00:50:17,536
晚安，维也纳。我已经离开大楼了。
Good night, Vienna. I've left the building.

690
00:50:17,537 --> 00:50:19,616
那你想在哪结婚?
Well, where would you like to get wed?

691
00:50:19,617 --> 00:50:23,056
因为，我是说，现在你可以在任何地方结婚。
Cos, I mean, you can get wed anywhere now, you know.

692
00:50:23,057 --> 00:50:24,377
哦，某个高档的地方。
Oh, somewhere classy.

693
00:50:26,257 --> 00:50:27,297
哦,是的。
Oh, yeah.

694
00:50:28,457 --> 00:50:30,016
南奥拉姆大厅。
South Ouram Hall.

695
00:50:30,017 --> 00:50:32,016
南奥拉姆大厅。
South Ouram Hall.

696
00:50:32,017 --> 00:50:34,377
哦，我以前很喜欢南奥拉姆大厅。
Oh, I used to love South Ouram Hall.

697
00:50:35,497 --> 00:50:38,456
它还在那儿吗?是的，就我所知是这样。
Is it still there? Yeah, yeah, far as I know.

698
00:50:38,457 --> 00:50:39,777
他们没有搞砸吗?
They've not mucked it up?

699
00:50:39,778 --> 00:50:43,537
不，我觉得还是和以前一样诡异。
No, I think it's just as creepy as it ever were.

700
00:51:27,817 --> 00:51:31,857
他在这里做什么?这是我的房子。
What's he doing here? It's my house.

701
00:51:33,897 --> 00:51:35,736
飞片。
Slapper.

702
00:51:35,737 --> 00:51:38,536
是的,不管。
Yeah, whatever.

703
00:51:38,537 --> 00:51:41,457
你是什么意思?这是什么?
What do you mean? Is this what...?

704
00:51:43,217 --> 00:51:44,537
你和他?
You and him?

705
00:51:47,017 --> 00:51:50,257
正确的。我要上楼去拿我剩下的东西。
Right. I'm off upstairs to get the rest of my stuff.

706
00:51:52,457 --> 00:51:53,497
我就在外面。
I'll be outside.

707
00:51:54,897 --> 00:51:57,737
你真的需要检查一下脑袋。
You really do need your head examined.

708
00:52:16,657 --> 00:52:17,697
啊!啊!
Ah! Ah!

709
00:52:19,977 --> 00:52:22,817
哦!哦!
Oh! Oh!

710
00:52:28,897 --> 00:52:30,977
喂?商店吗?
Hello? Shop?

711
00:52:36,297 --> 00:52:39,616
什么，没人吗?不，看起来不像。
What, nobody about? No, doesn't look like it.

712
00:52:39,617 --> 00:52:41,217
喂?
Hello?

713
00:52:45,577 --> 00:52:46,777
喂?
Hello?

714
00:52:51,137 --> 00:52:53,297
喂?
Hello?

715
00:53:07,177 --> 00:53:10,056
我表姐爱丽丝在这里见过一次鬼。
My cousin Alice saw a ghost here once.

716
00:53:10,057 --> 00:53:13,176
在哪里?呃…楼上。
Where? Er... upstairs.

717
00:53:13,177 --> 00:53:15,856
那是什么感觉?
What was it like?

718
00:53:15,857 --> 00:53:17,457
一个女人。
A woman.

719
00:53:34,257 --> 00:53:35,576
不要去。
Don't go.

720
00:53:35,577 --> 00:53:38,296
我不能把他赶出去。他没有别的地方可去。
I can't chuck him out. He's got nowhere else to go.

721
00:53:38,297 --> 00:53:40,897
我将……我去。你不能!你……你不能。
I'll... I'll go. You can't! You... You can't.

722
00:53:49,137 --> 00:53:51,177
不喜欢。
Don't.

723
00:54:11,657 --> 00:54:14,137
我…我想是这个房间。
I...I think it were this room.

724
00:54:28,297 --> 00:54:30,576
呃…她从那扇门进来的。
Er... she came through that door.

725
00:54:30,577 --> 00:54:33,016
她走过这里……
She walked across here...

726
00:54:33,017 --> 00:54:35,777
然后穿过那堵墙消失了。
and disappeared through that wall.

727
00:54:36,737 --> 00:54:39,297
哦。
Ooh.

728
00:54:49,417 --> 00:54:50,777
我们走吧?
Shall we go?

729
00:54:52,697 --> 00:54:55,457
停电。我们走吧。
Power cut. Let's go.

730
00:55:08,377 --> 00:55:09,417
哦!
Oh!

731
00:55:15,177 --> 00:55:16,936
喂?有人在吗?
Hello? Is anybody there?

732
00:55:16,937 --> 00:55:18,936
喂?
Hello?

733
00:55:18,937 --> 00:55:20,417
喂?电话。
Hello? Telephone.

734
00:55:24,697 --> 00:55:26,817
我这儿没有信号。我也没有。
I've got no reception. Neither have I.

735
00:55:45,297 --> 00:55:46,777
什么……
What the...

736
00:55:52,417 --> 00:55:54,697
哦……不…
Oh... No...

737
00:56:10,057 --> 00:56:12,856
你觉得有人发现我们失踪了吗?
Do you think anyone's realised that we're missing?

738
00:56:12,857 --> 00:56:16,016
我只是担心我爸身上带着治疗心脏病的药。
I just worry about my dad having his pills on him for his heart.

739
00:56:16,017 --> 00:56:18,056
上面有人。
There's somebody up there.

740
00:56:18,057 --> 00:56:20,417
你怎么知道他没带她去酒店
How do you know he hasn't taken her to some hotel

741
00:56:20,418 --> 00:56:22,696
为了一个疯狂的夜晚，互相推搡，眨眼?
for a wild night of nudge-nudge, wink-wink?

742
00:56:22,697 --> 00:56:24,416
他们到底在哪儿?
Where the hell are they?

743
00:56:24,417 --> 00:56:28,816
为什么车在那里，他们不在里面?你还得保持清醒足够长的时间
Why's the car there and them not in it? You still have to stay sober long enough

744
00:56:28,817 --> 00:56:32,616
用白纸黑字写下来。尿了!你觉得他们死了吗?
to actually get it down in black and white. Piss off! Do you think they're dead?

745
00:56:32,617 --> 00:56:35,536
你拿那个量尺干什么?你烧了我的路虎吗?
What were you doing with that dipstick? Did you torch my Land Rover?

746
00:56:35,537 --> 00:56:39,977
我不会在你和别人乱搞的时候和你住在一起。你知道门在哪里。
I'm not living with you while you're having it off with someone else. Well, you know where the door is.

747
00:56:40,379 --> 00:57:11,320
