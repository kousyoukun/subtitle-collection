1
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,840
Kate, hello.

2
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,920
Are you teaching?

3
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,920
Good.

4
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,920
Could you come to my office?

5
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,040
Yes, now, would you mind?

6
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:16,320
Caroline! We weren't expecting you.

7
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,640
How's your mum?

8
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,840
Fine. Yes.

9
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,320
Is she traumatised?

10
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,560
Um...

11
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,600
..don't know.

12
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,960
I, um...I don't think so. I was,

13
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,800
I feel all, um...

14
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,560
something else now.

15
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,400
Exhilarated.

16
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,760
Shock, possibly.

17
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:38,360
Can I get you some tea?
I think Alison's just made a pot.

18
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:41,280
Oh, has she? Oh, good. Um, yes.
Thank you.

19
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,560
What?

20
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,960
Oh... Oh...

21
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,160
I, um...told John.

22
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,120
About us?
God, it felt good.

23
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,840
Better, um...tuck that back in.

24
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,200
Beverley'll be in any minute
with the tea.

25
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,040
Oh, good.

26
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,720
Caroline...do you...

27
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:26,200
do you want to come round tonight?

28
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,360
Yup.

29
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,000
So presumably your mum...

30
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,720
Turned up, she's fine.
You all right?

31
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:34,560
I was awake all night, came home,
went to bed, couldn't sleep,

32
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,480
so I think I'm a bit, um...wired?

33
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,760
Is that a word? It's...

34
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,960
Yes, it's a very good word.

35
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,280
You're very pretty.

36
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,040
Am I? Mmm.

37
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,680
You're magnificent.

38
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
SHE SIGHS

39
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,400
SHE WHISPERS

40
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,560
Wouldn't that be
technically difficult?

41
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,600
Sure we'll think of something.

42
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,080
KNOCKING AT DOOR

43
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,000
Tea! Ah! Thank you.

44
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,720
Kate, can I get you one?
I should have asked.

45
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,320
No. Thanks, I'm...

46
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,880
I rearranged your meeting
with the chairman of the board
of governors at two.

47
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,640
Should I see
if he's still able to make it?

48
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,160
Um...

49
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:20,880
yup, if he's, um...still available.

50
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,440
Have you had any lunch?

51
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,120
Nope. Can I get you some?

52
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,240
No. Well, maybe, in a bit.

53
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,000
CRIES

54
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,840
You really all right?

55
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,600
Caroline.

56
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,840
I thought she was dead last night.

57
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,560
I thought they both were.

58
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,200
And there was this one moment
when I thought...

59
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,240
that's it.

60
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,520
And I couldn't stand it because I
thought, "How unfair would that be,

61
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:10,680
"to have met this one person again
after all these years,
and then died."

62
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:20,160
I'm sitting on the floor
in my own office.

63
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,840
Yeah, I'd spotted that.

64
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,960
It's the relief, is it?

65
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,840
Do you think maybe
you should be at home after all?

66
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,480
No.

67
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:34,480
I'll see Gavin at two
and then I might as well wait
till quarter past three.

68
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:39,160
Will you be at home by four o'clock?

69
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,240
I can be.

70
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,680
We escaped.

71
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,240
We did!

72
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,080
We keep having adventures.

73
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,320
We do!

74
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,920
I didn't have much in the way
of adventures until I met you.

75
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,160
Eh, eh, eh! You needn't look at me.

76
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,560
It's you that gets us
into these shenanigans. Hardly!

77
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:37,720
Well, it were your idea,
going up Southowram. Was it?

78
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,840
You...

79
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,440
Oh. OK.
HE SNIGGERS

80
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:54,280
It's odd. Weren't it? That...well,
whatever it were last night.

81
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:57,480
There were a distinct presence,
weren't there?

82
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,240
I just can't shake it off.

83
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,120
Well, we're here now.

84
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,360
Aren't we?

85
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,800
Back in the land of the living. So...

86
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,480
You know...

87
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,840
I told you about when Eddie died?

88
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:19,040
Yeah.

89
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,800
How he killed himself? Yeah.

90
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:25,680
Well, there were a bit more to it
than I'd said, and...

91
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,880
I think it's summat I ought
to tell you about.

92
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,560
Before we get wed.

93
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,240
What?
DOOR OPENS

94
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,240
Unh! Oh, bloody hell.

95
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,880
Oh, hell's bells.

96
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,080
Who is he when he's at home?

97
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,560
Ouch! Do you know him?

98
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,760
Yes.
Are you going to introduce us?

99
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:46,880
Right, well, that is Paul.

100
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,200
Hello, Mr Buttershaw.

101
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,480
This is Celia.

102
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,960
You all right, love?

103
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,880
You've been in the wars. Yeah.

104
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,240
Oh!

105
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,320
Tell me about it.

106
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,600
Paul? Gi... Oh.

107
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,440
Ah. Is it all right if I put
t'kettle on, Mr Buttershaw?

108
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:03,560
Only I'm supposed to keep me fluids
up and I think Gillian's forgot.

109
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,600
KNOCKING

110
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:09,160
See, somebody at the door now.
What were you going to tell me?

111
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,680
I'll... Later.

112
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,400
Ah...

113
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,800
Oh! Ah.

114
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,400
Do you need a hand up?

115
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,880
Hey! You're not dead, then.
How's Celia?

116
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,200
Is it Tuesday?

117
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,480
I'm in a pub.

118
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,480
I'm having trouble
with the reception.

119
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,600
We're in a bit of a dip,

120
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,640
can you hear me?
Loud and clear.

121
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:37,040
He goes out for a bit of lunch
every Tuesday with his pals.

122
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,520
And they've asked me along.

123
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,600
That's nice.

124
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,720
Yeah.

125
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,080
Anyway, the reason I'm ringing
is because I've decided

126
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,960
to stop a few days
while we sort out the wedding.

127
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:51,680
Only the thing is, I've not got
a clean change of underwear.

128
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,280
OK, so...? So you couldn't
pop over, could you?

129
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,080
With some...

130
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:01,160
with some knickers and a...and
a nightie, and me toothbrush?

131
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,640
Like a little overnight bag,
sort of business.

132
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,720
Well, Mum, I would,
but I've got a school to run.

133
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,680
You've not gone to work?!

134
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,200
You've been up all night!

135
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,280
Could you get Alan
to pop into Halifax with you?

136
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,240
They'll have an M&S, surely, or...

137
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,160
Oh, right. Don't worry about me!

138
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:18,120
Well, I would, but...
Hmm. I get the picture.

139
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,640
Can I ring you later?
If you've time.

140
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,760
Is that OK? It'll have to be.

141
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:23,920
So I'll ring you later.

142
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,960
I could have caught
a chill last night.

143
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:28,280
I could have caught pneumonia.

144
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,680
Yes, but you didn't.

145
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:34,120
All the same, I should be taking it
steady, not traipsing into Halifax.

146
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,200
You're in a pub.

147
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:39,160
What do you want for your birthday?
Can I ring you later?

148
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,880
Only I never know what to get you.

149
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,480
Yes, can I ring you later?

150
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,000
If I don't get you anything,
you'll say I'm being off with you.

151
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,480
Mum... How old are you this time?

152
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:50,600
Mum! I'm in a meeting.
Who are you in a meeting with?

153
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,000
The chairman of the
board of governors.

154
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,320
Oh, that smarmy beggar.
Well, you can tell him to eff off.

155
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,000
From me. Right.

156
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,120
I'll ring you later.

157
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,480
Yeah, don't knock yourself out.

158
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,200
I will ring you. Later. Hmm.

159
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,000
Think what you want
for your birthday.

160
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,640
Get me something from Marks's
when you go buying your necessaries.

161
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,880
Bye-bye.

162
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,960
Bye.

163
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,400
She sends her regards.

164
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,320
Do you want a straw, love?
Actually...

165
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,080
How much?

166
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:30,240
He's asking 4,000. He'll take less.
Well, what condition's it in?

167
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,200
Oh, you'd have to take it
for a test drive.

168
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:36,600
Well, I can't imagine her getting
more than a few thousand off
insurance.

169
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,880
If that.
Still, it's her birthday tomorrow.

170
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,480
Gillian's? Is it?

171
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:45,480
So I'm thinking, happen I could
make up the difference for her.

172
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,240
How old is she?

173
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,680
Um...40-summat.

174
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:54,560
You want me to ring up, see if he's
around this aff so you can have a go
with it?

175
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,880
Yeah, sure. Why not? I'll pop
outside, see if I can get a signal.

176
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,200
Right.

177
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:08,680
Now, Alan, have you
thought about a best man?

178
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:11,160
No, not yet, not really.

179
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:16,120
You see, I'm used to a certain
degree of public speaking.

180
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:19,160
Having been on t'council
all them years. Of course.

181
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,800
And I can be very amusing,
of course.

182
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:27,280
I was often complimented on
my humorous turn of phrase and wit

183
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,840
and illuminating insights.

184
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:31,400
Yeah, yeah.

185
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:34,960
Then there's the, um, other aspect.

186
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,000
Is there? Which?

187
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,440
Not losing the ring.

188
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:41,080
Turning up on time.

189
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:44,000
Sober. All that side.

190
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,840
Yeah, well... Obviously.

191
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:51,560
Shall I break it to him, then?
Or will you?

192
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,240
Sorry? Harry.

193
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,840
Oh! What have I missed?

194
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:59,320
POSH ACCENT: We've bought you
a medium-dry white wine, Celia.

195
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,320
Oh! That's lovely, thank you.

196
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:04,040
Harry's lad's friend's
selling a Land Rover.

197
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,400
I thought we could pop up
and have a look at it

198
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,680
for our Gillian this after.
Oh, very good.

199
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:14,000
I hope you're not taking painkillers
and drinking alcohol.

200
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,160
Can you fetch us a straw, love?

201
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,400
Don't mention owt to Harry yet.

202
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:25,040
Let me deal with that side
of things. OK.

203
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,960
Dad?

204
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,400
Dad?

205
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,760

Sorry. Caroline, it's Gillian.

I'm sorry to be ringing you,
only... How are you?

00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,920
You haven't... They've...

They're not... They're not here.

214
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:36,320
I mean, they were here and now
they're not. You haven't...seen them,
have you?

215
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,040
They were in a pub. Sorry?

216
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:41,800
My mother rang, about an hour ago.
They were in a pub with some friends
of Alan's.

I, um, panicked.

220
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:52,000
I've been out working all morning
and then when I came in
and they weren't here

221
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,520
and the car gone...

222
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,960
You all right?

223
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,080
I just...

224
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:03,480
Gillian? It's brought it home to me.

225
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,360
Last night.

226
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,320
I don't think I could stand it
if I lost him.

227
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,480
Not just yet.

228
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,520
Especially not since he's met
your mum again, he's been so happy.

229
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,480
Sorry.

230
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,560
Don't be sorry.

231
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:24,440
Perhaps you should give me
your mum's mobile number.

232
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:27,360
For future reference.
I've got a feeling...

233
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,360
I'm going to need it if they're
going to carry on like this.
Sure.

00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,720

Oh, um...

00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:37,640
you couldn't do me a favour,

Hello, love!

00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:49,000
You don't know what's happened
to Paul, do you?

242
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,920
The fella that was... Paul?

00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,600
Yes, he's here, he's with us.

He was going stir crazy at home.

245
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,800
Were you wanting to speak to him?

246

No!

247
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,120
Where are you?

248
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,680
I'm...I'm not entirely sure.

249
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:03,880
Where are we, Alan?

250
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,400

We're up Soyland!

253
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,720
Right. OK.

254
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,520
Can you tell my dad... Are Harry
and Maurice with you?

255
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,560
Yes. Yes, they are, love.

256
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,840
Right, can you tell my dad
to tell Harry and Maurice

257
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:25,960
to take Paul home to his mother's?
They know where he lives.

258
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:28,320
And to leave him there, right?

259
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,560
And not to bring him back to ours.

260
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,640
Yes!

261
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,280
Yes, I can do that.

262
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:36,040
Fabulous! Oh!

263
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:38,200

I've spoken to Caroline.

267
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:46,440
I'm going into Halifax,
what sort do you want?

268
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,720
Well, um...

269
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,440
And what size?

270
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,640
I'm struggling to hear you,

271
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,960
I think the signal's going.

272
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,440
Hello? I think we're stuck.

273
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:59,040
I'm going to have to go.
We'll be fine.

274
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,480
Now, I'm hanging up now.
Hello?

275
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,840
What's that smell?

276
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,680
That smell, I'm afraid to say...

277
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,800
It's like tomatoes.

278
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,160
It's like metal tomatoes.

279
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:13,400
That smell is the smell
of a buggered clutch, Alan.

280
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:17,080
Oh, aye, did I not say?
Lad said it'd need a new clutch.

281
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:21,040
We can pop to McNally's scrap yard
and get a re-whatsited one for about
70 quid.

282
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:26,160
Other than that, I'd say it's in
damn near pretty perfect condition.

Right, so...the thing is, what
size knickers does your mum wear?

291
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:27,480
Only when I rang her
she couldn't tell me herself

292
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:30,800
cos she was embarrassed cos
me dad and Harry and Maurice
were there with her

It's Gillian.

297
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:43,160
..just buy a few different sorts
and a few different sizes?

298
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:46,560
What does she want? She wants
to know what size knickers
my mother wears.

299
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,480
And then any that aren't suitable
I can just take back.

300
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,320
They'll be fine with that,
won't they?

301
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,200
Yeah! If they're unopened.

302
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,480
Y...yeah. Yeah, course they will.

303
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,200
Good idea.

304
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,560
OK, sorry to bother you.

305
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,800
No problem.

306
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:02,000
Thank you. Ta-ra.

Ah, go on.

I've been meaning to say, Alan,
regarding t'wedding...

316
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,880
..you'll want a best man
that people like, won't you?

317
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:36,320
You won't want somebody
who'll drone on,

318
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,160
talk about himself

319
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,800
ad infinitum for 40 minutes.

320
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,960
Cos you know that's what'll happen.

321
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,160
Whereas, thing is...

322
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,480
..I've never been a best man.

323
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:52,880
And, um, it's summat
I'd like to do...

00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,960
once, before I die.

325
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,280
Well, I'll, um...

326
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,440
Yeah, yeah. I'll...

327
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,640
Smashing.

328
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,200
Shall I tell him? Or will you?

329
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,400
Yeah, I'll... Yeah, leave it to me.

330
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:33,800
So what are you going to do?
Well, I don't know.

331
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,360
Can you have two best men?

332
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,920
No. It'd look daft.

333
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:40,280
Well, I'll have
to worry about that tomorrow.

334
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,640
Like Scarlett O'Hara.

335
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:44,160
Are you suited with it?

336
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,920
Oh, I think so.

337
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:48,520
We'll shut it in here,
she'll have a surprise in t'morning.

338
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,160
What were you going
to tell me earlier?

339
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,080
When that lad fell down the stairs.

340
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,040
Oh.

341
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,080
Yeah.

342
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,960
Let's put t'kettle on, eh?

343
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:25,520
It may sound summat and nowt
when I say it, but...

344
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:29,920
They'd been arguing,
this is what Gillian told me after.

345
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,200
He'd been drinking, Eddie had.

346
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,840
Threatening to...kill himself.

347
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,320
Then she found him,
he were in t'barn,

348
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,760
he'd smashed his head open
with t'log splitter.

349
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,680
But the thing is...

350
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:48,000
when she found him, he weren't dead.

351
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,280
And not only that...

352
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,600
He were still conscious.

353
00:19:54,600 --> 00:20:00,080
Then I got here about, ooh...an hour
after it had happened, and...

354
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:05,440
..she'd called police by that
stage, by that stage he were dead.

355
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,080
She told me...

356
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,640
..she just stood there...

357
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,520
..and watched him slip away.

358
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,640
Right in front of her.

359
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,680
Rather than get help.

360
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:25,160
So that's why...

361
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,120
Anyway.

362
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,320
Why what?

363
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,600
Robbie.

364
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:37,640
The others thought
summat untoward had gone on.

365
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,680
That...she had killed him,

366
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,240
which were nonsense, she didn't.

367
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,840
But she didn't call
an ambulance either.

368
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:48,560
She told me what she'd done
as soon as I got here,

369
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:51,200
which I suppose makes me
complicit in it.

370
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,400
I don't blame her.

371
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,160
Not for a second.

372
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:00,240
He made her life a misery
and there were no way under t'sun

373
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,320
I were going to shop her
to the police.

374
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:07,320
So, I wanted you to know
that I did that,

375
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:12,840
because, strictly speaking,
it weren't right. But...

376
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,560
Anyway, that's it.

377
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,960
Are you shocked?

378
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,200
No.

379
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,240
Are you disappointed?

380
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,440
No.

381
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,440
No.

382
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:31,040
I told you about Kenneth, what
I'd have done given half a chance.

383
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,760
You thought about it, we did it.

384
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:33,960
You didn't.

385
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,120
I covered it up.

386
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:38,920
Don't tell Gillian I've told you.
No, I won't.

387
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:42,600
Ever. Promise me. I promise.

388
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,480
And I keep my promises.

389
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,560
It sort of bought it back
last night.

390
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:51,880
There's always been
a funny feeling in that barn since.

391
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:56,440
I do sometimes wonder
if he's still in there.

392
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,800
Let it go.

393
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,760
I'm glad you've told me,
but now let it go.

394
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,760
You don't think less of me?

395
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:07,600
No, never.

396
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,720
I love you.

397
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,280
I love you.

398
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,400
Sorry.

399
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,080
We've gone all miserable.

400
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:26,160
We don't want that, do we? No.

401
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,800
We need to be laughing, you and me!

402
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,880
Hey.

403
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:33,000
Do you remember all that jiving
we used to do?

404
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,560
Oh, gosh.

405
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,760
Do I remember?!

406
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:42,440
DISTANT MUSIC: "Tutti Frutti"
by Little Richard

407
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,680
Oh, no!
No, don't mind me.

408
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,320
We were just... Good!

409
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:38,480
...reminiscing.
You should reminisce more often!

410
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,520
Oh heck, now you'll be
telling everybody.

411
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:43,320
Smashing photos.

412
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,760
I'm texting 'em to Caroline.

413
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,080
Did you get rid of him?
Hey? Paul.

414
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,360
Oh, yes. Well, yes.

415
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:53,000
Harry took him in his Mondeo.

416
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,800
Good job well done.

417
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,480
Celia?

418
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,320
Knickers.

419
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:01,840
Owt that doesn't fit or isn't right
we'll take back.

420
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,960
Oh, thanks. How much do I owe you?

421
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:06,560
There's a receipt in there
somewhere.

422
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:09,360
And, I rung Robbie.
Him and Raff are coming round
for supper.

423
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,440
Robbie?!

424
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,680
Yeah, tonight.

425
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,360
Raff's bringing his stuff back.

426
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,440
He's moving back in.

427
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,120
So,

428
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:19,800
I bought a chicken
and a couple of bottles of wine.

429
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:22,920
Ooh! We're celebrating.
What are we celebrating?

430
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,760
Everything, anything.
You name it, we'll celebrate it.

431
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,320
Well, I'll just go upstairs
and sort myself out.

432
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:31,160
Do you know where you're going?
Yes, thanks, love.

433
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:33,560
Robbie was really on it last night,
Dad.

434
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:36,520
He really bothered,
really surprised me,

435
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:40,560
and he apologised for all the crap
and nonsense and rubbish.

436
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,440
I think he were genuine.

437
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,720
That bed'll need a clean sheet
and another duvet cover.

438
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,960
Oh, and Celia?

439
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,600
I got this for Caroline.

440
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:57,200
She said to get her something
from M&S for you to give to her
for her birthday.

441
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,360
She said it would be
a weight off your mind,

442
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,360
or her mind,
or one of your minds, yeah?

443
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,560
Thanks.

444
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,040
Don't worry, he's gone.

445
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,160
He better have.

446
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,440
Where have you been?

447
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:45,040
Work. Till this time?

448
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:47,360
Boys all right?

449
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,520
Where have you been?

450
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:49,960
Where haven't I been?

451
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:52,160
Just...tell me who it is.

452
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,240
No.

453
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:56,720
I won't get cross.
Ooh, lucky me(!)

454
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,640
Are you making it up?

455
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,680
How's Judith?

456
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:03,040
I finished with Judith. I don't want
to see her again as long as I live.

457
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:05,600
Is she pretty, Judith?
I've never asked you.

458
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,720
She's... No, actually,
she's rather ugly.

459
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:10,440
When you've seen her
fall down the stairs more than once

460
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:13,960
and wet herself vomiting, it's hard
to think of her as anything else.
Who is it?

461
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:17,760
There are other people,
more important people, who need
to know before you.

462
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:18,840
Why? Just say it.

463
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:21,800
Is it that unctuous git that's
chairman of your board of...?

464
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:22,880
Gavin!

465
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:26,680
Anyway, he's married, with children.

466
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:29,120
Do you think I'd do that?

467
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:34,240
I thought the idea was we were
going to try to make it work here,

468
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,320
for the boys.

469
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:38,240
Only as a practical arrangement
until they got off to university.

470
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,480
You must have known I was never
really going to get back into bed
with you.

471
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,640
So I'm just going to live here
while you sleep around?

472
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:46,200
I'm not going to sleep around,
but you could.

473
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:49,240
Actually, if I'm with someone else
and you're going to sleep around...

474
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:52,680
I don't want to sleep around.
..we might as well just call it
a day and get divorced.

475
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,280
You're not having the house.

476
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,560
I'm having the boys,
because I never walked out on them,

477
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:59,440
and no court in its right mind would
throw them out of the family home.

478
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,560
Caroline. Get yourself a good lawyer.
I intend to.

479
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:04,280
Caroline, I don't want
to get divorced.

480
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:06,040
Well, I'm sorry,
I've come full circle.

481
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:08,560
If I love and trust someone
enough to have sex with them

482
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:11,480
I don't want them relegated to the
Fourth Division, I want them here.

483
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,040
Where I can have them.

484
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:15,200
Any time I like.

485
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,880
Do you know what I realised
last night?

486
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,960
I've been depressed.

487
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,400
For months.

488
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,800
And last night I was so low

489
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,200
I hit rock bottom, and then...

490
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:32,560
..when my mum turned up I turned
a corner, something lifted,
it was physical.

491
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:35,840
This fog that's been there for
months, it vanished, just like that,

492
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,800
and everything became clear
and I felt...

493
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,880
..happy.

494
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,160
Like I can't remember feeling
for years.

495
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:47,240
You're not moving him in here.

496
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,440
It's not a he.

497
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:52,920
I suppose we might as well
get that out of the way.

498
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:56,360
I need to tell the boys,
and I need to tell my mother,

499
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,480
and until I've had the chance to do
that myself,

500
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,040
I'd appreciate you being discreet.

501
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:03,400
Whoever the hell else you choose to
tell is of course your business

502
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,840
but clearly we have
to address the possibility that

503
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:08,920
it might upset the boys initially,
until they get used to it.

504
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:13,400
So obviously if you need to take the
piss and make ridiculous comments

505
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,560
it'd be best if you did it straight
to my face and not in front of them.

506
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,720
But being a liberal-minded
intellectual,

507
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,800
I assume you won't need
to do that anyway.

508
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,080
Yeah.

Hello?

512
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:31,680
I spent 45 quid. Is that all right?

513
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,760
Oh, that's brilliant.

514
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,320
I got a dressing-gown

515
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:38,360
for you, well,
for her to give to you.

516
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:41,800
It's just a white towel robe thing.

517
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,680
Perfect, that's perfect.

518
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:46,280
If you don't want it,
I'll have it. No!

519
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:48,920
It's spot-on, thank you.

520
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:51,280
If you give me your bank details
I'll transfer the cash.

521
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:53,840
I'll pay for her stuff as well.

522

When is it your birthday,
by the way, out of interest?

525
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,840
Just cos it's mine tomorrow.

526
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,400
Tomorrow.

527

You're kidding.

No!

Why?

546
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:53,280
It's funny, it sort of teases you
out of thought, doesn't it?

I mean, how t'heck

I mean, you couldn't invent that,
could you?

549

You know I told you I used to think
about you, when I was with Kenneth?

And you said you used to think about
me, sometimes?

Yeah.

I wonder if we were thinking
about each other, that night.

553
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,800
The night, you know,
they were conceived.

554
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:26,520
I think it's just another sign.

That things were always meant to be,
don't you?

I'd better go back down,
help Gillian wi' t'washing up.

Or else I'll be in bother.

No. You can do.

You should go to bed.

Hmm.

Fine.

597
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:24,280
If it's someone that deserves you.

598
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,560
OK.

599
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,600
Well then, yes I am.

00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:46,960
OK, well, if...

If it, if, if it, erm...

607
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:51,880
it was...

608
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,240
..what would, how would you...

609
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:57,080
She's nice! I like her.

610
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:58,560
She's clever,

611
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,920
she's interesting, she's kind.

612
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,600
How...

613
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:03,920
How did you know?

614
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,440
I saw you.

615
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:08,320
When you came in
to invigilate for my exam yesterday,

616
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,960
just the way you looked
at each other.

Nowt!

We found it.

It were free, at side of t'road.

Oh, you shouldn't have.
You're getting married.

636
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,400
You're going to need all the
money... Shut up.

00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,440
Nice one, Grandad.

...beautiful. It's...

00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:12,440
..got wheels and everything!

it's for our Gillian.

Dad!

644
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:21,480
Only thing is, the clutch has gone.

645
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,160
So I've bought a new one,

646
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:27,120
well, a re-whatsited one,
is on t'front seat.

647
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:29,160
So you'll...

648
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,280
Be having to put that in myself.

649
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:34,120
Well, you like mucking about
inside engines, don't you? So...

650
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:35,960
Yeah.

651
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,200
Thanks, Dad.

652
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,440
Harry says otherwise
it were in perfect condition.

653
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:42,440
Harry? For its vintage.

654
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:44,480
SHE LAUGHS

655
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:47,000
You pillock!

656
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,320
Right, I'm off.
Happy birthday, Mother.

657
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:51,120
Oh!

658
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,960
See you, Gramps. Ta-ta, Celia.

659
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,120
Bye, love.
Hey, do you want a lift?

660
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,360
In this?

661
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,960
Not in that.

662
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,120
In that!

663
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:02,920
Yeah, me and Celia are going to
t'registry office in Halifax, so...

664
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:03,960
Are you?

665
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,360
Yeah, just to have a look.

666
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:08,480
Oh, well, yeah, yeah,
I mean, if you're going that way.

667
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:26,080
Out. Get off me, bitch!

668
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:27,560
I am not having him.

669
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,200
I am sick of him,

670
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,840
I am sick to the back teeth of him.

671
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:34,200
You are nothing but trouble.

672
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,080
Bloody nuisance, he is.

673
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,720
Yeah, well he's not
coming back 'ere!

674
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:41,600
Well, you should have thought
about that before you started
mucking about with him.

675
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:44,040
It's your fault he's in this mess.
Bitch! Liar!

676
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:47,160
I only got in t'car cos she said
she was taking me round me granny's.

677
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,880
You're not leaving him here!

678
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,640
Watch me. You're not!

679
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:54,320
ENGINE STARTS

680
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:57,200
I'll get t'keys for t'car.
Do you want to get in, Raffy?

681
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,800
Bitch!

682
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,080
Raff?

683
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:42,400
TYPING

684
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,160
She's not a lesbian.

685
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:47,520
Oh, OK. So what would you call it,
then?

686
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:50,160
If she's getting into bed
with another woman.

687
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,440
No, she's just not a lesbian.

688
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:54,080
Whatever it is she's doing
with this other woman, she's not...

689
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,960
She just doesn't look like a lesbian.

690
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:58,800
I know what lesbians look like.
We have them on campus.

691
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,600
They meet in Derwent Bar
on Monday nights.

692
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:03,480
God! Aren't you quaint?!
What decade do you live in?

693
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:06,000
Do you think she looks like...?
Oh, you've never seen her.

694
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,680
No, but I'm warming to her.

695
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,400
I wonder what it's like.

696
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,480
What?

697
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:13,560
To get hot and steamy
with another woman.

698
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:14,600
God, well,

699
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:17,280
I can't imagine it's...
Well, what is it? What do they do?

700
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,880
They haven't got anything
to do anything with, have they?

701
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,760
Are you being deliberately stupid?

702
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:26,000
No, course not, you're just
lashing out. Who wouldn't?

703
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,680
You've just found out that
the woman you've been married
to...for how long?

704
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,080
18 years.

705
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,920
18 years!

706
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:36,120
Has probably been faking it,
every single time.

707
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:38,640
No, no, she hasn't,
she wouldn't, she's not...

708
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:41,040
Well, either that
or every time you made her come

709
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:44,000
she was pretending that you were,
you know, a girl.

710
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
A girly, a girly-whirly!

711
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,160
No, no, no, that's...

712
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:49,480
We had... Me and Caroline
had fantastic...

713
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:51,800
You don't know what's
in people's heads.

714
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:54,240
You don't know what was in
my head when I shagged you.

715
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:57,320
Well, what is?
Well, I could be thinking all sorts.

716
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,600
Anything.

717
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,160
Yeah, well, what?

718
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,240
I'm not telling you!

719
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,640
I've been used.

720
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:06,840
No, you haven't.

721
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,320
Well, yeah, you have.

722
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:11,960
But hasn't everybody at some stage?

723
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:14,920
PHONE BEEPS AND VIBRATES

724
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,040
It's her.

725
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,760
Oh, shall I answer it?

726
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:20,880
Yes?

727
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,040
Where are you?

728
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:24,240
Does it matter?
Where did you sleep last night?

729
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,240
It doesn't... I'm not...
It's none of your...

730
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,080
Have you moved out again
or something?

731
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,680
No! OK, well,

732
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:34,600
I'm planning to cook tonight for
my birthday for my, erm...friend.

733
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,640
And the boys.

734
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,920
I want to know if you'll be
in or out.

735
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,800
I don't know where I'll be.

736
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,800
OK. Well, if you're in,

737
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,960
given that it's where you live,

738
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,280
I'd, er...

739
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,880
I'd like you to join us.

740
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,640
Are you serious?

741
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,680
Yes, assuming
you'd only accept the invitation

742
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:56,120
if you were going to behave like an
adult in front of the children.

743
00:39:56,120 --> 00:40:00,720
Piss off, you sanctimonious,
patronising mad bitch!

744
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:07,600
Problem? She's invited me
for dinner with her and her...

745
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:08,720
Oh, are you going?

746
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,960
No! Do you want to know
what she looks like?

747
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:13,680
No! I don't want to see that...

748
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:16,800
Hang on. What?

749
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,880
My God! It's that woman
she had in the garden

750
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,800
when she chucked
all that water over me.

751
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,240
Lawrence said she was a lesbian.

752
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:24,680
Go on, go and have dinner
with them. No!

753
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:26,400
Oh, OK.

754
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,440
Shame.

755
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,600
Cos, thing is, to be frank, John,

756
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:31,000
I don't want you here either.

757
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,840
I've started to realise
what a bad influence you are on me.

758
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:51,280
It seems very impersonal.

759
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,560
I'm still cross about the church.

760
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:58,040
Maybe if she'd accommodated us,

761
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:01,000
that vicar,
we'd have started going again.

762
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,880
I think she took
a very short-term view.

763
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,760
What about Southowram?

764
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:08,640
Well, they did offer.

765
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:12,240
I thought you said wild horses
wouldn't drag you back there.

766
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:15,480
Yes, I know I did,
but if it's the only place...

767
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:17,040
No, it's no good then, is it?

768
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:21,880
They have a lovely chapel
at Caroline's school.

769
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:25,680
I went there once to
a little concert she'd organised.

770
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,960
Do they not hire it out
for weddings?

771
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,240
Who?

772
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:30,520
The school!

773
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:34,640
Would you want
to get wed in Harrogate?

774
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:38,600
I don't mind where we get wed,
as long as it's what you want.

PHONE RINGS

Hello?

Caroline's... Oh, hello.

00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:23,560
Who is it?
I'm sorry I'm ringing you.

00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:24,640
I...

782
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,160
What's happening? Anything?

783
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:29,080
I was just wondering...
The thing is...

784
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:31,680
Oh, dear.

785
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,280
Are you all right?

786
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:36,760
I'm not entirely certain
why I'm ringing you. Just...

787
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:38,400
Has something happened?

788
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:41,600
You gave me such good advice that
time, you know, when Caroline

789
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,120
drove off without me and...

790
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:44,440
What's up?

791
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:46,960
Can I come over?

792
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:49,720
If you like.

793
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:50,800
Would you mind?

794
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,400
No, course not. What's it...

795
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,720
What's it to do with?

796
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,200
It's, it's...

797
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:57,920
Just say it.

798
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,360
Caroline.

799
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:00,400
Caroline?

800
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:02,560

00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:33,480
Dinner's going to be
another 40 minutes, sorry.

810
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:34,880
It's fine, I'll help you.

811
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:36,080
Thanks, William.

812
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:40,680
Or would you like to play
Scrabble while Mum's cooking,
if you like, or...?

813
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:42,520
God, haven't played
Scrabble in years.

814
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:45,520
I'll see if Lawrence wants to.
He can't spell,
but it's good for him.

815
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:53,240
I told him. He knows.

816
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:55,280
He's been brilliant about it.

817
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:00,320
I've not told Lawrence. I'm just
waiting for the right kind of...

818
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:01,920
Yeah. ...moment.

819
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:02,960
OK.

820
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:14,840
Are you going to stay tonight?

821
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:15,960
Sure.

822
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:19,840
Is John not...?
Oh, I haven't a clue where John is.

823
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:25,920
TV: CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

824
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:42,040
THEY SIGH

825
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:43,920
Do you know, my feet!

826
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:47,080
Mm, yeah, but
we're making progress now.

827
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:50,000
We still don't know
where we're living!

828
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,840
Well, we could spend
a few weeks here and then
a few weeks over in Harrogate.

829
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:56,480
We could alternate at intervals.

830
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:58,840
That way, they can all get
equally sick of us.

831
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:02,560
Yeah, and we can get
equally sick of them!

832
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:06,640
Oh, I'm not sure about
this hat now I've bought it.

833
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:09,080
Well, buy another one.
You've got three weeks.

834
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:11,400
Yeah. Bugger the expense.

835
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:13,560
Buy the cat a goldfish.

836
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:14,840
Celia?

837
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:17,280
What, my love?

838
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:20,800
What I told you yesterday...

839
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:22,400
What about it?

840
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:25,960
Well, it were manslaughter.

841
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:27,640
I don't know if I made that clear.

842
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:31,640
Even though he'd tried to take
his own life, she could've still...

843
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:32,680
Alan?

844
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:34,480
It's forgotten.

845
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:38,000
Well, I just want to know that...

846
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,120
you realise...

847
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:42,640
Listen, one of the great things
about getting older -

848
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:44,480
I don't know if you feel the same -

849
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:46,960
is that very little shocks
you any more.

850
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:49,840
And that certainly doesn't.

851
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:51,880
You know that.

852
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:56,880
HE SIGHS HAPPILY

853
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:01,040
Have you got my perfume?

854
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:05,760
Celia!
We've shopped till we've dropped!

855
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:09,040
John's here.

856
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:11,640
Er, he's been here all afternoon.

857
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:14,160
And, erm...
he's had a bit to drink.

858
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:17,360
What?
And he's being a bit...emotional.

859
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:18,600
Why, what's happened?

860
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:22,560
OK, erm, well...

861
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:24,840
erm, Caroline, um...

862
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:25,960
Is she all right?

863
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:27,880
She's fine. She's...

864
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:30,360
She's... She's... She's... She's...

865
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:31,800
Has she been in an accident?

866
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:34,040
No! No, no, no, no.
She was all right at lunchtime

867
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:36,640
when we spoke to her about the
chapel. No, she's fine.

868
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:39,440
She's fine.
It's nothing to do with that.

869
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:40,960
Right. Is that Celia?

870
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:44,320
Yeah, sounds like it. Listen, pal,
why don't you let Gillian...

871
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:46,400
Oi! Celia!

872
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:47,760
He...

873
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:48,920
She, er...

874
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:51,760
Oh, John ought to tell you himself,
really. Well, no, Caroline.

875
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:54,200
CONVERSATION CONTINUES IN DISTANCE

876
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:58,320
The thing is, John's had
a bit to drink, and he's...

877
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:00,480
Celia! Oh, God.

878
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:02,680
What's happened?!
Nothing's happened.

879
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:04,320
What are you doing here?

880
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:05,840
Came to see Gillian.

881
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:08,280
How much have you had to drink?

882
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:11,360
Loads.
Has something happened with Caroline?

883
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:13,440
Well, yeah, you could
kind of say that.

884
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:15,960
No, it's... John, you're very drunk.
Just bear that in mind

885
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:17,920
before you say anything else.

886
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:20,960
Can someone kindly tell Celia
what's going on?

887
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,560
Did you know that
Caroline's a lesbian?

888
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:31,520
What's he talking about?

889
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:34,360
Did you know that? Did you know that
I've been married to this woman?

890
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:36,960
And you wonder why I had an affair?
This woman,

891
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:38,800
who for 19 years

892
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:41,000
has been either faking it or...

893
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,400
Shut up.

894
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:45,000
Gillian, shut him up.

895
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,680
What a bloody silly thing to say.

896
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:48,520
Do you know how that makes me feel?

897
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:52,600
Your ridiculous bloody daughter...
Hey, that's enough
of that sort of talk.

898
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:56,520
What's he doing here, anyway?
Why's he here upsetting people?

899
00:47:56,520 --> 00:47:59,520
Alan! John,
you're upsetting her. I don't care!

900
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:02,360
Well, I do. Come on, let's take it
outside. Get your hands off me!

901
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:04,240
I want you to calm down.

902
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:06,640
That's wicked, coming out
with something like that.

903
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:08,400
And who've you been telling it to?

904
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:09,720
I'm saying it cos it's true,

905
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:12,080
cos she's been having it off
with another woman!

906
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:14,760
Get him out of the way.
Come on, outside.

907
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:17,320
What are you doing? Get outside!

908
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:19,080
What woman?

909
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:23,000
Come... Come and sit down.
I'll make you some tea.

910
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,120
I don't want any tea!

911
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:26,960
I want to go home.

912
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:31,080
At school? In the chapel.

913
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:33,680
Then we'll move on to somewhere else
for the reception.

914
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:36,720
I'm checking out a few
possible venues for them.

915
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:39,440
It'll be fantastic.
It'll be gorgeous.

916
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:41,960
It'll be just what she wants.
It's so amazing. Your mum!

917
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:44,200
I know! I know, it's perfect.

918
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:45,840
It's wonderful.

919
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:47,240
It's what she deserves.

920
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:50,840
Even if she's had to wait
all this time to get it.

921
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:55,120
Can I get drunk? No.

922
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:56,360
DOORBELL RINGS

923
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:00,360
SLURRED: Oh! Hello!

924
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:02,600
Er...

925
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:03,760
can I help you?

926
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:06,040
Sorry, I dropped a bottle of wine.

927
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:08,320
Just now. It was...

928
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:09,520
meant to be a present.

929
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:12,840
Are you...Caroline?

930
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:17,680
I was looking for John. Is he in?

931
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:20,600
Judith?

932
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:22,120
Yeah.

933
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:24,280
No, he's not in.
I don't know where he is.

934
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:26,320
Oh. Right.

935
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:28,720
I think I've upset him.

936
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:31,920
I wanted to apologise to him.

937
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:35,120
But I guess that
you're here now, so...

938
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:37,520
Have you seen him?

939
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:39,920
This morning. But, you know,
it's over.

940
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:41,520
It's good.

941
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:44,400
Even so, I don't want to hurt him.

942
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:47,960
And hey, listen, it's great!

943
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:50,200
I'm really cool with it. Well done.

944
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:52,960
Sorry?

945
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:54,480
I used to have

946
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:58,560
this horrendous crush
on one of my dad's girlfriends.

947
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:01,720
So, you know, I'm right there
with you.

948
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:03,080
What are you talking about?

949
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:06,440
I used to imagine
what it might be like to snog her.

950
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:08,440
Would you like me to call you
a taxi? No.

951
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:10,160
And listen...

952
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:11,240
Caroline...

953
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:12,680
I'm sorry I...

954
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:15,320
You know, in the end,

955
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:17,600
maybe it wasn't entirely his fault.

956
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:19,840
Not that I'm defending him.
Useless twat.

957
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:22,560
But there's got to be something,
hasn't there, not working,

958
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:24,520
before a bloke...

959
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:26,320
goes off? Mind where you're...

960
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:27,840
GLASS SMASHES

961
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:28,960
Judith!

962
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:33,360
What are you doing?!
I'm helping you!

963
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:35,960
Kate! Was that Caroline?

964
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:08,720
He's asleep.

965
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:10,920
What a puff.

966
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:12,920
Fainting!

967
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:16,440
You don't have to stay, you know.
I can handle things.

968
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:20,040
I'm 15. I'll stay here with you
until your mum gets back.

969
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:24,840
She's seeing someone. Mum.

970
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:26,880
Did you know? Yes.

971
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:28,640
Yes.

972
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:29,840
I did know.

973
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:32,640
Who?

974
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:35,400
Well...

975
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:38,880
I expect she'll talk it through
with you when she's ready.

976
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:41,440
"Talk it through"? What do you mean?

977
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:44,320
PHONE RINGS

978
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:45,640
Will that be her?

979
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:48,880
Hello? Hi. Is that William?

980
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:49,960
Lawrence.

981
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:51,440
Lawrence.

982
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:54,400
Hi. Er, it's Gillian,
Alan's daughter.

983
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:56,000
Is Caroline there?

984
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,120
No, she's had to rush
somebody into hospital.

985
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:01,240
Oh. Er...

986
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:02,760
Oh, erm...

987
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:06,160
Um...that'll be why
she hasn't been picking up

988
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:08,240
her mobile, then. Why?

989
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:09,840
Well, cos...

990
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:13,800
Can you give her a message from me
when she gets back?

991
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:15,000
Yep.

992
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,040
Can you tell her...

993
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:18,160
er...

994
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:22,200
her mother's driving over
with me dad in the dark.

995
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:23,880
I couldn't stop them. I tried.

996
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:27,560
And you know, neither of them's
eyesight is that good. But, er,

997
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:30,240
I wanted to just warn her

998
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:33,200
that she's upset. Erm, Celia.

999
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:34,960
You, your granny. She's upset...

1000
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:40,080
..cos she's found out
about this relationship, erm...

1001
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:42,040
Caroline's been having...

1002
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:46,400
..with, er, with...with...

1003
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:47,800
Kate.

1004
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:51,280
Yeah.

1005
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:53,520
Kate.

1006
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:55,240
What, you knew?

1007
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:58,560
Yeah.

1008
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:03,080
OK.

1009
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:06,240
Right. I'll...I'll tell her.

1010
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:08,520
Bye.

1011
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:10,040
Bye.

1012
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:15,880
What?

1013
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,760
Raff's gone to bed.

1014
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:22,920
I'm going to get off. I'm up at six.

1015
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:23,960
OK.

1016
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:27,240
Are you all right with this joker,
or do you want me to deposit him
somewhere?

1017
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:30,880
No, leave him. He's upset.
He can sleep down here

1018
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:34,480
with Paul. I'll find him a duvet.

1019
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:35,560
Right.

1020
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:38,680
Night. Night.

1021
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:47,880
Night. Night.

1022
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:56,720
SHE SIGHS

1023
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:21,200
Help yourself.

1024
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:26,000
Dozy bugger.

1025
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:31,280
I suppose...

1026
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:33,840
you won't believe me...

1027
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:36,800
if I said I didn't really
come over here to do that.

1028
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:41,440
It was just an excuse, really...

1029
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:44,040
..to see you again.

1030
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:46,960
I've...

1031
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:48,600
kept thinking about you.

1032
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:13,720
HE SIGHS

1033
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:18,320
Sorry, I need to rest me eyes
for five minutes.

1034
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:22,080
Would you like a cup of coffee?

1035
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:24,720
Mm, we can do.

1036
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:30,800
He'll have t'wrong end of t'stick.

1037
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:32,440
Ring her!

1038
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:34,760
No.

1039
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:36,040
Would you like me to ring her?

1040
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:37,400
No!

1041
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:50,120
I can't decide....

1042
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:53,400
..if you're an evil git

1043
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:56,920
or if it's actually
quite...flattering

1044
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:59,000
and romantic that you'd go
to such lengths

1045
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:02,520
and piss so many people off
so massively

1046
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:04,280
just to have an excuse
to come and see me.

1047
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:06,720
None of it, it wasn't...

1048
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:08,040
I didn't plan it.

1049
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:11,880
And I'm not horrible.

1050
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:14,400
Just like you...

1051
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:16,000
said.

1052
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,800
About when Raff got annoyed
with you. I'm just...

1053
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:22,480
..disappointingly human.

1054
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:36,960
Do you want to go upstairs?

1055
00:56:48,185 --> 00:56:51,745
