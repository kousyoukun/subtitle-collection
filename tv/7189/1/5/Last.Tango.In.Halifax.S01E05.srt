1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,680
你想在哪里结婚，现在你可以在任何地方结婚。
Where would you like to get wed, you can get wed anywhere now.

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:05,440
我们被关在里面了。我们不是窃贼，我们是领养老金的人。
We got shut in. We're not burglars, we're pensioners.

3
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:08,980
他们到底在哪儿?
Where the hell are they?

4
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:12,180
不管发生了什么，他都会照顾她的。我知道。
Whatever has happened, he'll be looking after her. I know that.

5
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:13,860
你觉得他们死了吗?
Do you think they're dead?

6
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:16,260
你不能借给我一些钱，是吗?
You couldn't lend me some money, could you?

7
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:17,980
两个月的房租，够了。
Two months rent, that's it now.

8
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:22,300
吉莉安，他们很好。他们一直在打牌和吃巧克力。
Gillian, they're fine. They've been playing cards and eating chocolate.

9
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:24,460
慵懒的…!
Dozy...!

10
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:29,420
你真以为我没跟别人睡过吗?
Do you seriously think I haven't slept with other people?

11
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:31,780
你拿着那个量尺干什么?我们配合得很好
What are you doing with that dipstick? We make an all right team,

12
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:34,500
你，我和拉夫，不是吗?
you, me and Raff, couldn't we?

13
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:38,260
我有男朋友了。我还不知道这是不是我想要的。
I'm seeing someone. I don't know if it's what I want entirely yet.

14
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:40,900
工作上的人?我不试试就不知道。
Someone at work? I won't know if I don't try.

15
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:42,900
那是谁呢?没有人。为什么这是个秘密?
Who is it then? No-one. Why is it a secret?

16
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:35,460
哨声响起，孩子们欢呼雀跃
WHISTLE BLOWS AND CHILDREN SHOUT

17
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:45,740
凯特,你好。
Kate, hello.

19
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,820
好。
Good.

20
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:52,820
你能来我办公室一趟吗?
Could you come to my office?

21
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:54,940
是的，现在，你介意吗?
Yes, now, would you mind?

22
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:01,220
卡洛琳!我们没想到你会来。
Caroline! We weren't expecting you.

23
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:02,540
你妈妈好吗?
How's your mum?

24
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:03,740
很好。是的。
Fine. Yes.

25
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:05,220
她受到心理创伤了吗?
Is she traumatised?

26
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:06,460
嗯…
Um...

27
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:10,500
．.不知道。
..don't know.

28
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,860
我,嗯…我不这么想。我是,
I, um...I don't think so. I was,

29
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:14,700
我觉得，嗯…
I feel all, um...

30
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:17,460
现在说点别的。
something else now.

31
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:19,300
兴奋。
Exhilarated.

32
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,660
冲击,可能。
Shock, possibly.

33
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:23,260
我给你倒点茶好吗?艾莉森好像刚煮了一壶。
Can I get you some tea? I think Alison's just made a pot.

34
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:26,180
哦，是吗?哦,很好。嗯,是的。谢谢你！
Oh, has she? Oh, good. Um, yes. Thank you.

35
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:35,460
怎么啦？
What?

36
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:51,860
哦……哦……
Oh... Oh...

37
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,060
我,嗯…告诉约翰。
I, um...told John.

38
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:00,020
关于我们?天啊，感觉好极了。
About us? God, it felt good.

39
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:02,740
好,嗯…把它塞回去。
Better, um...tuck that back in.

40
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:05,100
贝弗利马上就来送茶。
Beverley'll be in any minute with the tea.

41
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,940
哦,很好。
Oh, good.

42
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:08,620
卡洛琳……你……
Caroline...do you...

43
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:11,100
你今晚想来吗?
do you want to come round tonight?

44
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,260
是的。
Yup.

45
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:14,900
所以你妈妈…
So presumably your mum...

46
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:16,620
出现了，她很好。你没事吧?
Turned up, she's fine. You all right?

47
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:19,460
我整晚都没睡，回到家，上床，睡不着，
I was awake all night, came home, went to bed, couldn't sleep,

48
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:21,380
所以我觉得我有点…
so I think I'm a bit, um...wired?

49
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:22,660
这是一个词吗?这是……
Is that a word? It's...

50
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,860
是的，这是一个非常好的词。
Yes, it's a very good word.

51
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:27,180
你很漂亮。
You're very pretty.

52
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:28,940
我是吗?嗯。
Am I? Mmm.

53
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:30,580
你是华丽的。
You're magnificent.

54
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,900
她叹了口气
SHE SIGHS

55
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:39,300
她低声说
SHE WHISPERS

56
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:42,460
这在技术上不是很困难吗?
Wouldn't that be technically difficult?

57
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:44,500
当然，我们会想办法的。
Sure we'll think of something.

58
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,980
敲门
KNOCKING AT DOOR

59
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:49,900
茶!啊!谢谢你！
Tea! Ah! Thank you.

60
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:52,620
凯特，要我帮你拿一杯吗?我应该先问问的。
Kate, can I get you one? I should have asked.

61
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:54,220
不。谢谢你,我…
No. Thanks, I'm...

62
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:58,780
我把你和董事会主席的会面重新安排在两点。
I rearranged your meeting with the chairman of the board of governors at two.

63
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,540
要我看看他还能不能来吗?
Should I see if he's still able to make it?

64
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,060
嗯…
Um...

65
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:05,780
是的，如果他…仍然可用。
yup, if he's, um...still available.

66
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:07,340
你吃过午饭了吗?
Have you had any lunch?

67
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:09,020
不。要来点吗?
Nope. Can I get you some?

68
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:11,140
不。好吧，也许吧。
No. Well, maybe, in a bit.

69
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:15,900
哭
CRIES

70
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,740
你真的没事吗?
You really all right?

71
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,500
卡洛琳。
Caroline.

72
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:37,740
我以为她昨晚死了。
I thought she was dead last night.

73
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:39,460
我以为他们都是。
I thought they both were.

74
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:45,100
有那么一刻，我想……
And there was this one moment when I thought...

75
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,140
就是这样。
that's it.

76
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:51,420
我无法忍受，因为我想，“这太不公平了，
And I couldn't stand it because I thought, "How unfair would that be,

77
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:55,580
“这么多年后再见到这个人，然后就死了。”
"to have met this one person again after all these years, and then died."

78
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:05,060
我坐在自己办公室的地板上。
I'm sitting on the floor in my own office.

79
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:06,740
是的，我发现了。
Yeah, I'd spotted that.

80
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,860
这是解脱，是吗?
It's the relief, is it?

81
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:11,740
你觉得你到底是不是该待在家里?
Do you think maybe you should be at home after all?

82
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:14,380
不。
No.

83
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:19,380
我两点去见加文，然后我不妨等到三点一刻。
I'll see Gavin at two and then I might as well wait till quarter past three.

84
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:24,060
你四点能到家吗?
Will you be at home by four o'clock?

85
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,140
我可以。
I can be.

86
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:05,580
我们逃脱了。
We escaped.

87
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:07,140
是我们做的!
We did!

88
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:08,980
我们一直在冒险。
We keep having adventures.

89
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:10,220
我们所做的!
We do!

90
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:12,820
在遇到你之前，我并没有多少冒险经历。
I didn't have much in the way of adventures until I met you.

91
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:15,060
呃，呃，呃!你不必看着我。
Eh, eh, eh! You needn't look at me.

92
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:18,460
是你让我们陷入这些恶作剧的。几乎没有!
It's you that gets us into these shenanigans. Hardly!

93
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:22,620
去南角是你的主意。是吗?
Well, it were your idea, going up Southowram. Was it?

94
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:23,740
你……
You...

95
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:26,340
哦。好的。他嘲笑
Oh. OK. HE SNIGGERS

96
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:39,180
这是奇怪的。不是吗?那不管昨晚发生了什么。
It's odd. Weren't it? That...well, whatever it were last night.

97
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:42,380
有一个明显的存在，不是吗?
There were a distinct presence, weren't there?

98
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:46,140
我就是甩不掉。
I just can't shake it off.

99
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:50,020
好吧，我们现在到了。
Well, we're here now.

100
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:51,260
不是吗?
Aren't we?

101
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:54,700
回到人间。所以…
Back in the land of the living. So...

102
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:59,380
你知道的…
You know...

103
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:01,740
我告诉过你埃迪死的时间吗?
I told you about when Eddie died?

104
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:03,940
是的。
Yeah.

105
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:06,700
他是怎么自杀的?是的。
How he killed himself? Yeah.

106
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:10,580
嗯，事情比我说的要复杂一些，而且……
Well, there were a bit more to it than I'd said, and...

107
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:13,780
我想这件事我应该告诉你。
I think it's summat I ought to tell you about.

108
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:15,460
在我们结婚之前
Before we get wed.

109
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:18,140
怎么啦？门打开
What? DOOR OPENS

110
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:20,140
主要研究!哦，该死的。
Unh! Oh, bloody hell.

111
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:22,780
哦，见鬼了。
Oh, hell's bells.

112
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:23,980
他在家的时候是谁?
Who is he when he's at home?

113
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:25,460
哎哟!你认识他吗?
Ouch! Do you know him?

114
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:28,660
是的。你要介绍我们认识吗?
Yes. Are you going to introduce us?

115
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:31,780
好吧，那就是保罗。
Right, well, that is Paul.

116
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:33,100
你好，巴特肖先生。
Hello, Mr Buttershaw.

117
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,380
这是西莉亚。
This is Celia.

118
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:35,860
你没事吧，亲爱的?
You all right, love?

119
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:37,780
你参加过战争。是的。
You've been in the wars. Yeah.

120
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:39,140
哦!
Oh!

121
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:40,220
告诉我吧。
Tell me about it.

122
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:42,500
保罗?胃肠道……哦。
Paul? Gi... Oh.

123
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,340
啊。我可以烧壶水吗，巴特肖先生?
Ah. Is it all right if I put t'kettle on, Mr Buttershaw?

124
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:48,460
只是我得多喝水，我想吉莉安忘了。
Only I'm supposed to keep me fluids up and I think Gillian's forgot.

125
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:50,500
敲门
KNOCKING

126
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:54,060
看，有人在敲门。你想跟我说什么?
See, somebody at the door now. What were you going to tell me?

127
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:55,580
我将……以后。
I'll... Later.

128
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:57,300
啊…
Ah...

129
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,700
哦!啊。
Oh! Ah.

130
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:03,300
你需要帮忙吗?
Do you need a hand up?

131
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:07,780
嘿!那么你还没死。西莉亚怎么样?
Hey! You're not dead, then. How's Celia?

132
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:10,100
今天是星期二吗?
Is it Tuesday?

133
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,380
我在酒吧里。
I'm in a pub.

134
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:15,380
我的信号接收有问题。
I'm having trouble with the reception.

135
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:16,500
我们正处于低谷，
We're in a bit of a dip,

136
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,540
你能听到我说话吗?响亮而清晰。
can you hear me? Loud and clear.

137
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:21,940
他每周二都和朋友们出去吃点午饭。
He goes out for a bit of lunch every Tuesday with his pals.

138
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:23,420
他们还邀请了我。
And they've asked me along.

139
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:24,500
这很好。
That's nice.

140
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,620
是的。
Yeah.

141
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:28,980
总之，我打电话是因为我已经决定了
Anyway, the reason I'm ringing is because I've decided

142
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:31,860
在我们安排婚礼的时候暂停几天。
to stop a few days while we sort out the wedding.

143
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:36,580
问题是，我没有干净的换洗内衣。
Only the thing is, I've not got a clean change of underwear.

144
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:40,180
好的,所以……吗?所以你不能过来，对吧?
OK, so...? So you couldn't pop over, could you?

145
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:41,980
有一些…
With some...

146
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:46,060
穿着短裤和…还有睡衣和牙刷?
with some knickers and a...and a nightie, and me toothbrush?

147
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:48,540
就像一个小旅行袋，生意之类的。
Like a little overnight bag, sort of business.

148
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:50,620
嗯，妈妈，我很想，但是我要管理学校。
Well, Mum, I would, but I've got a school to run.

149
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:52,580
你没去上班?!
You've not gone to work?!

150
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:54,100
你整晚都没睡!
You've been up all night!

151
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,180
你能让艾伦和你一起去哈利法克斯吗?
Could you get Alan to pop into Halifax with you?

152
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:58,140
他们肯定会有玛莎百货，或者……
They'll have an M&S, surely, or...

153
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:00,060
哦,对了。别为我担心!
Oh, right. Don't worry about me!

154
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:03,020
嗯，我会的，但是……嗯。我明白了。
Well, I would, but... Hmm. I get the picture.

155
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:05,540
我过会儿给你打电话好吗?如果你有时间的话。
Can I ring you later? If you've time.

156
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:07,660
这样可以吗?它必须是。
Is that OK? It'll have to be.

157
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:08,820
我晚点再给你打电话。
So I'll ring you later.

158
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:10,860
昨晚我可能着凉了。
I could have caught a chill last night.

159
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:13,180
我可能得了肺炎。
I could have caught pneumonia.

160
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:14,580
是的，但是你没有。
Yes, but you didn't.

161
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:19,020
尽管如此，我还是应该稳扎稳打，而不是拖拖拉拉地走到哈利法克斯。
All the same, I should be taking it steady, not traipsing into Halifax.

162
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:20,100
你在酒吧里。
You're in a pub.

163
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:24,060
你生日想要什么礼物?我过会儿给你打电话好吗?
What do you want for your birthday? Can I ring you later?

164
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:25,780
只是我不知道该给你买什么。
Only I never know what to get you.

165
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:27,380
是的，我稍后给你打电话好吗?
Yes, can I ring you later?

166
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:29,900
如果我不给你买东西，你会说我跟你走了。
If I don't get you anything, you'll say I'm being off with you.

167
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:32,380
妈妈……这次你多大了?
Mum... How old are you this time?

168
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:35,500
妈妈!我在开会。你在和谁开会?
Mum! I'm in a meeting. Who are you in a meeting with?

169
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,900
董事会主席。
The chairman of the board of governors.

170
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:42,220
哦，那个谄媚的乞丐。你可以叫他滚开。
Oh, that smarmy beggar. Well, you can tell him to eff off.

171
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,900
从我。正确的。
From me. Right.

172
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,020
我过会儿给你打电话。
I'll ring you later.

173
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:47,380
是啊，别太劳累了。
Yeah, don't knock yourself out.

174
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:50,100
我会给你打电话的。以后。嗯。
I will ring you. Later. Hmm.

175
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,900
想想你想要什么生日礼物。
Think what you want for your birthday.

176
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:54,540
你去买生活必需品的时候给我带点东西。
Get me something from Marks's when you go buying your necessaries.

177
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:55,780
再见。
Bye-bye.

178
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:56,860
再见。
Bye.

179
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,300
她向我问好。
She sends her regards.

180
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:08,220
你要吸管吗，亲爱的?实际上……
Do you want a straw, love? Actually...

181
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:10,980
多少钱?
How much?

182
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:15,140
他要价4000。他会接受更少的。嗯，它的状况如何?
He's asking 4,000. He'll take less. Well, what condition's it in?

183
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:17,100
哦，你得试驾一下。
Oh, you'd have to take it for a test drive.

184
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:21,500
我无法想象她能少拿几千美元的保险金。
Well, I can't imagine her getting more than a few thousand off insurance.

185
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:24,780
如果这一点。不过，明天是她的生日。
If that. Still, it's her birthday tomorrow.

186
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:26,380
吉莉安的吗?是吗?
Gillian's? Is it?

187
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:30,380
所以我在想，也许我可以为她弥补差额。
So I'm thinking, happen I could make up the difference for her.

188
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,140
她多大了?
How old is she?

189
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:34,580
嗯……40-summat。
Um...40-summat.

190
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:39,460
你想让我打个电话，看看他在不在这样你就可以试试了吗?
You want me to ring up, see if he's around this aff so you can have a go with it?

191
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:42,780
是的,当然。为什么不呢?我去外面看看能不能收到信号。
Yeah, sure. Why not? I'll pop outside, see if I can get a signal.

192
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:44,100
正确的。
Right.

193
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:53,580
艾伦，你想过伴郎人选吗?
Now, Alan, have you thought about a best man?

194
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:56,060
不，还没有，还没有。
No, not yet, not really.

195
00:10:56,060 --> 00:11:01,020
你看，我已经习惯了某种程度的公开演讲。
You see, I'm used to a certain degree of public speaking.

196
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:04,060
我在长老会待了这么多年。当然可以。

人们常常称赞我幽默的措辞和机智

是的,嗯…很明显。
Yeah, well... Obviously.

207
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:36,460
那我要不要告诉他?你会吗?
Shall I break it to him, then? Or will you?

208
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:38,140
抱歉?哈利。
Sorry? Harry.

209
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:39,740
哦!我错过了什么?
Oh! What have I missed?

217
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:06,300
先别跟哈利提什么。
Don't mention owt to Harry yet.

218
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:09,940

也许你应该把你妈妈的手机号码给我。
Perhaps you should give me your mum's mobile number.

248
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:12,260
供将来参考。我有一种感觉……

如果他们继续这样下去，我就需要它了。确定。

00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:54,060
就像金属番茄。
It's like metal tomatoes.

295
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:58,300
那味道是手包的味道，艾伦。
That smell is the smell of a buggered clutch, Alan.

296
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:01,980
哦，是啊，我不是说过吗?Lad说需要一个新的离合器。
Oh, aye, did I not say? Lad said it'd need a new clutch.

297
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:05,940
我们可以去麦克纳利的废品站花70英镑买一个重新定位的。
We can pop to McNally's scrap yard and get a re-whatsited one for about 70 quid.

298
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:11,060
除此之外，我得说它的状态近乎完美。
Other than that, I'd say it's in damn near pretty perfect condition.

299
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:22,940
门铃响了
DOORBELL RINGS

300
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,860

301
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:34,220
嗨。

302
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:42,580
叹了口气
SIGHS

303
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:55,780
电话响了。
PHONE RINGS Shit.

304
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:56,940
哦。
Oh.

305
00:16:58,740 --> 00:16:59,780
喂?
Hello?

306
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:07,820
对,所以……问题是，你妈妈穿多大号的内裤?
Right, so...the thing is, what size knickers does your mum wear?

307
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:12,380
只是当我给她打电话时，她不能亲自告诉我
Only when I rang her she couldn't tell me herself

308
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:15,700
因为她很尴尬因为我爸，哈里和莫里斯也在她身边
cos she was embarrassed cos me dad and Harry and Maurice were there with her

309
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,900
所以…哦,我…我…我…
so... Oh, I...I...I...

310
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:21,220
我真的不……的计谋…再…你,嗯…
I don't really... Cou...cou...you, um...

311
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:23,300
嗯…我为什么不…?
um... Why don't I just...?

312
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:24,940
(是谁?)吉莉安。
(Who is it?) It's Gillian.

313
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:28,060
．.只买几种不同的种类和不同的尺寸?
..just buy a few different sorts and a few different sizes?

314
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:31,460
她想要什么?她想知道我妈穿几号内裤。
What does she want? She wants to know what size knickers my mother wears.

315
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:34,380
然后任何不合适的我都可以收回。
And then any that aren't suitable I can just take back.

316
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:36,220
他们不会介意的，对吧?
They'll be fine with that, won't they?

317
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:38,100
是啊!如果没开封的话。
Yeah! If they're unopened.

318
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,380
Y…是的。是的，他们当然会。
Y...yeah. Yeah, course they will.

319
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:42,100
好主意。
Good idea.

320
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,460
好的，很抱歉打扰你。
OK, sorry to bother you.

321
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:44,700
没有问题。
No problem.

322
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,900
谢谢你！Ta-ra。
Thank you. Ta-ra.

323
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,260
我欠你一个人情。
I owe you one.

324
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:50,140
再见。再见。
Bye. Bye.

325
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:51,780
怎么啦？
What?

326
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,060
这有什么不对吗?
What's wrong with that?

327
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:58,100
One hundred.
100.

328
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,940
不…
No...

329
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:01,100
你要75张吗?
Will you take 75?

330
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:03,180
啊，接着说。
Ah, go on.

331
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:13,660
我一直想说，艾伦，关于婚礼…
I've been meaning to say, Alan, regarding t'wedding...

332
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:18,780
．.你想要一个大家都喜欢的伴郎，对吧?
..you'll want a best man that people like, won't you?

333
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:21,220
你不会想要一个喋喋不休的人，
You won't want somebody who'll drone on,

334
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:23,060
谈论自己
talk about himself

335
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:25,700
无限广告，40分钟。
ad infinitum for 40 minutes.

336
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:27,860
因为你知道那是会发生的。
Cos you know that's what'll happen.

337
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:31,060
然而，问题是……
Whereas, thing is...

338
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:34,380
．.我从来没当过伴郎。
..I've never been a best man.

339
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:37,780
这是我想做的一件事…
And, um, it's summat I'd like to do...

340
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:39,860
一次，在我死之前。
once, before I die.

341
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:43,180
好吧，我会…
Well, I'll, um...

342
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:46,340
是的,是的。我将……
Yeah, yeah. I'll...

343
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:47,540
粉碎。
Smashing.

344
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:52,100
要我告诉他吗?你会吗?
Shall I tell him? Or will you?

345
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:54,300
是的,我会……是啊，交给我吧。
Yeah, I'll... Yeah, leave it to me.

346
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:18,700
那你打算怎么做?嗯，我不知道。
So what are you going to do? Well, I don't know.

347
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,260
你能请两个伴郎吗?
Can you have two best men?

348
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:22,820
不。那会看起来很傻。
No. It'd look daft.

349
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:25,180
那我明天再担心吧。
Well, I'll have to worry about that tomorrow.

350
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:26,540
像思嘉·奥哈拉那样。
Like Scarlett O'Hara.

351
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:29,060
你适合吗?
Are you suited with it?

352
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:30,820
哦，我想是的。
Oh, I think so.

353
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:33,420
我们把它关在这里，明天早上她会有一个惊喜。
We'll shut it in here, she'll have a surprise in t'morning.

354
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:37,060
你之前想跟我说什么?
What were you going to tell me earlier?

355
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:38,980
当那个孩子从楼梯上摔下来的时候。
When that lad fell down the stairs.

356
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:40,940
哦。
Oh.

357
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:41,980
是的。
Yeah.

358
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,860
让我们把水壶放上，好吗?
Let's put t'kettle on, eh?

359
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:10,420
我说的时候可能听起来微不足道，但是……
It may sound summat and nowt when I say it, but...

360
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:14,820
他们一直在争吵，这是吉莉安后来告诉我的。
They'd been arguing, this is what Gillian told me after.

361
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:17,100
他喝了酒，艾迪喝了。
He'd been drinking, Eddie had.

362
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:19,740
威胁……自杀。
Threatening to...kill himself.

363
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:24,220
然后她找到了他，他在谷仓里，
Then she found him, he were in t'barn,

364
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:26,660
他用原木劈刀把自己的头敲开了。
he'd smashed his head open with t'log splitter.

365
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:29,580
但问题是……
But the thing is...

366
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:32,900
她发现他的时候，他还没死。
when she found him, he weren't dead.

367
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:35,180
不仅如此……
And not only that...

368
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:39,500
他仍然清醒。
He were still conscious.

369
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:44,980
然后我来到这里，哦…事情发生一小时后，然后……
Then I got here about, ooh...an hour after it had happened, and...

370
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:50,340
．.那个时候她已经报警了，那个时候他已经死了。
..she'd called police by that stage, by that stage he were dead.

371
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:52,980
她告诉我……
She told me...

372
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:56,540
．.她只是站在那里……
..she just stood there...

373
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:00,420
．.看着他悄悄溜走。
..and watched him slip away.

374
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:03,540
就在她面前。
Right in front of her.

375
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:05,580
而不是寻求帮助。
Rather than get help.

376
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:10,060
这就是为什么…
So that's why...

377
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:15,020
无论如何。
Anyway.

378
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:17,220
为什么什么?
Why what?

379
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:19,500
Robbie。
Robbie.

380
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:22,540
其他人以为发生了什么不愉快的事。
The others thought summat untoward had gone on.

381
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:24,580
那她杀了他，
That...she had killed him,

382
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:26,140
这些都是废话，她没有。
which were nonsense, she didn't.

383
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:29,740
但她也没有叫救护车。
But she didn't call an ambulance either.

384
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:33,460
我一到这里她就告诉我她做了什么，
She told me what she'd done as soon as I got here,

385
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:36,100
我想我也是同谋
which I suppose makes me complicit in it.

386
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:40,300
我不怪她。
I don't blame her.

387
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,060
一秒钟都没有。
Not for a second.

388
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:45,140
他使她的生活很痛苦，在太阳底下是没有办法的
He made her life a misery and there were no way under t'sun

389
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:47,220
我打算把她交给警察。
I were going to shop her to the police.

390
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:52,220
我想让你知道是我做的，
So, I wanted you to know that I did that,

391
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:57,740
因为，严格来说，这是不对的。但是…
because, strictly speaking, it weren't right. But...

392
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:01,460
不管怎样，就是这样。
Anyway, that's it.

393
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:02,860
你感到震惊吗?
Are you shocked?

394
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:05,100
不。
No.

395
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,140
你失望了吗?
Are you disappointed?

396
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:07,340
不。
No.

397
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,340
不。
No.

398
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:15,940
我跟你说过肯尼斯的事，如果有一点机会我也会这么做。
I told you about Kenneth, what I'd have done given half a chance.

399
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:17,660
你想过，我们做过。
You thought about it, we did it.

400
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:18,860
你没有。
You didn't.

401
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:20,020
我把它盖起来了。
I covered it up.

402
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,820
别告诉吉莉安我告诉你了。不，我不会的。
Don't tell Gillian I've told you. No, I won't.

403
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:27,500
永远。答应我。我保证。
Ever. Promise me. I promise.

404
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,380
我遵守我的诺言。
And I keep my promises.

405
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:33,460
它昨晚算是把它买回来了。
It sort of bought it back last night.

406
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:36,780
从那以后，谷仓里总有一种奇怪的感觉。
There's always been a funny feeling in that barn since.

407
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:41,340
我有时会怀疑他是否还在里面。
I do sometimes wonder if he's still in there.

408
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:42,700
随它去吧。
Let it go.

409
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:47,660
我很高兴你告诉了我，但现在随它去吧。
I'm glad you've told me, but now let it go.

410
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:49,660
你没有看轻我吗?
You don't think less of me?

411
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:52,500
不,从来没有。
No, never.

412
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:57,620
我爱你。
I love you.

413
00:22:57,620 --> 00:23:00,180
我爱你。
I love you.

414
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:05,300
对不起。
Sorry.

415
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,980
我们都很痛苦。
We've gone all miserable.

416
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:11,060
我们不希望那样，对吧?不。
We don't want that, do we? No.

417
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:13,700
我们得开怀大笑，你和我!
We need to be laughing, you and me!

418
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:14,780
嘿。
Hey.

419
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:17,900
你还记得我们以前一起跳舞吗?
Do you remember all that jiving we used to do?

420
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:21,460
哦,天哪。
Oh, gosh.

421
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:23,660
我记得吗?!
Do I remember?!

422
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:27,340
遥远的音乐:小理查德的《Tutti Frutti》
DISTANT MUSIC: "Tutti Frutti" by Little Richard

423
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:18,580
哦,不!不，别介意我。
Oh, no! No, don't mind me.

424
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:20,220
我们只是…好!
We were just... Good!

425
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:23,380
回忆。你应该经常回忆往事!
...reminiscing. You should reminisce more often!

426
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:25,420
见鬼，现在你要告诉所有人了。
Oh heck, now you'll be telling everybody.

427
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:28,220
了照片。
Smashing photos.

428
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:29,660
我在给卡洛琳发短信
I'm texting 'em to Caroline.

429
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:32,980
你把他赶走了吗?嘿?保罗。
Did you get rid of him? Hey? Paul.

430
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:35,260
哦,是的。嗯,是的。
Oh, yes. Well, yes.

431
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:37,900
哈利开着他的蒙迪欧带着他。
Harry took him in his Mondeo.

432
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:39,700
干得好。
Good job well done.

433
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:41,380
西莉亚?
Celia?

434
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:43,220
短裤。
Knickers.

435
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:46,740
不合适或不合适的东西我们会收回。
Owt that doesn't fit or isn't right we'll take back.

436
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:48,860
哦,谢谢。我该付你多少钱?
Oh, thanks. How much do I owe you?

437
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:51,460
这里有张收据。
There's a receipt in there somewhere.

438
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:54,260
然后，我打电话给Robbie。他和拉夫要过来吃晚饭。
And, I rung Robbie. Him and Raff are coming round for supper.

439
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:55,340
罗比? !
Robbie?!

440
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:56,580
是的,今晚。
Yeah, tonight.

441
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:58,260
拉夫把他的东西带回来了。
Raff's bringing his stuff back.

442
00:24:58,260 --> 00:24:59,340
他要搬回来了。
He's moving back in.

443
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:01,020
所以,
So,

444
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:04,700
我买了一只鸡和几瓶酒。
I bought a chicken and a couple of bottles of wine.

445
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:07,820
噢!我们庆祝。我们在庆祝什么?
Ooh! We're celebrating. What are we celebrating?

446
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:10,660
一切,任何事情。只要你能说出来，我们就庆祝。
Everything, anything. You name it, we'll celebrate it.

447
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:13,220
好吧，我还是上楼去整理一下自己吧。
Well, I'll just go upstairs and sort myself out.

448
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:16,060
你知道你要去哪里吗?是的，谢谢，亲爱的。
Do you know where you're going? Yes, thanks, love.

449
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:18,460
罗比昨晚真的很忙，爸爸。
Robbie was really on it last night, Dad.

450
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:21,420
他真的很困扰我，让我很惊讶，
He really bothered, really surprised me,

451
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:25,460
他为所有的废话和垃圾道歉。
and he apologised for all the crap and nonsense and rubbish.

452
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:28,340
我认为他是真诚的。
I think he were genuine.

453
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:31,620
那张床需要一张干净的床单和一个羽绒被套。
That bed'll need a clean sheet and another duvet cover.

454
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:32,860
哦，西莉亚呢?
Oh, and Celia?

455
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:37,500
我给卡洛琳买的。
I got this for Caroline.

456
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:42,100
她让我从玛莎百货买些东西给她，让你在她生日时送给她。
She said to get her something from M&S for you to give to her for her birthday.

457
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:44,260
她说这会让你轻松很多，
She said it would be a weight off your mind,

458
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:46,260
或者她的大脑，或者你们的大脑?
or her mind, or one of your minds, yeah?

459
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:47,460
谢谢。
Thanks.

460
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:09,940
别担心，他走了。
Don't worry, he's gone.

461
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:11,060
最好是这样。
He better have.

462
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:26,340
你去哪儿了?
Where have you been?

463
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:29,940
工作。直到现在?
Work. Till this time?

464
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:32,260
孩子们还好吗?
Boys all right?

465
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:33,420
你去哪儿了?
Where have you been?

466
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:34,860
我还没去过哪里?
Where haven't I been?

467
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:37,060
只是…告诉我是谁。
Just...tell me who it is.

468
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:38,140
不。
No.

469
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:41,620
我不会生气的。哦，我真幸运!
I won't get cross. Ooh, lucky me(!)

470
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:43,540
你在瞎编吗?
Are you making it up?

471
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:44,580
朱迪思怎么样?
How's Judith?

472
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:47,940
我和朱蒂丝结束了。我这辈子都不想再见到她了。
I finished with Judith. I don't want to see her again as long as I live.

473
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:50,500
她漂亮吗，朱蒂丝?我从没问过你。
Is she pretty, Judith? I've never asked you.

474
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:52,620
她的……不，事实上，她很丑。
She's... No, actually, she's rather ugly.

475
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:55,340
当你不止一次看到她从楼梯上摔下来
When you've seen her fall down the stairs more than once

476
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:58,860
把自己弄湿呕吐，很难想象她是别的什么人。是谁?
and wet herself vomiting, it's hard to think of her as anything else. Who is it?

477
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:02,660
还有其他人，更重要的人，需要在你之前知道。
There are other people, more important people, who need to know before you.

478
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:03,740
为什么?说出来吧。
Why? Just say it.

479
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:06,700
是你们董事会主席那个油嘴滑舌的混蛋吗?
Is it that unctuous git that's chairman of your board of...?

480
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:07,780
加文!
Gavin!

481
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:11,580
总之，他结婚了，有了孩子。
Anyway, he's married, with children.

482
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:14,020
你觉得我会那么做吗?
Do you think I'd do that?

483
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:19,140
我以为我们的想法是我们要试着让它在这里工作，
I thought the idea was we were going to try to make it work here,

484
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:20,220
给男孩们。
for the boys.

485
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:23,140
在他们上大学之前，这只是一个实际的安排。
Only as a practical arrangement until they got off to university.

486
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:26,380
你一定知道我再也不会和你上床了。
You must have known I was never really going to get back into bed with you.

487
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:28,540
所以我就住在这里，而你到处乱搞?
So I'm just going to live here while you sleep around?

488
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:31,100
我不会到处乱搞，但你可以。
I'm not going to sleep around, but you could.

489
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:34,140
事实上，如果我和别人在一起，而你要到处乱搞……
Actually, if I'm with someone else and you're going to sleep around...

490
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:37,580
我不想到处乱搞。我们不如就到此为止，离婚吧。
I don't want to sleep around. ..we might as well just call it a day and get divorced.

491
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:39,180
房子不是你的了。
You're not having the house.

492
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:41,460
我要生孩子，因为我从没抛弃过他们，
I'm having the boys, because I never walked out on them,

493
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:44,340
任何心智正常的法庭都不会把他们赶出家门。
and no court in its right mind would throw them out of the family home.

494
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:46,460
卡洛琳。给自己找个好律师。我打算这么做。
Caroline. Get yourself a good lawyer. I intend to.

495
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:49,180
卡罗琳，我不想离婚。
Caroline, I don't want to get divorced.

496
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:50,940
抱歉，我又兜了一圈。
Well, I'm sorry, I've come full circle.

497
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:53,460
如果我爱一个人，信任他，愿意和他做爱
If I love and trust someone enough to have sex with them

498
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:56,380
我不希望他们降级到第四级别，我希望他们留在这里。
I don't want them relegated to the Fourth Division, I want them here.

499
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:57,940
在我可以拥有它们的地方。
Where I can have them.

500
00:27:57,940 --> 00:28:00,100
随时都可以。
Any time I like.

501
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:03,780
你知道我昨晚意识到什么吗?
Do you know what I realised last night?

502
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:05,860
我一直很沮丧。
I've been depressed.

503
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:07,300
好几个月了。
For months.

504
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:09,700
昨晚我情绪很低落
And last night I was so low

505
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:12,100
我跌入谷底，然后…
I hit rock bottom, and then...

506
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:17,460
．.当我妈妈出现的时候，我拐了个弯，有什么东西被举起来了，那是身体上的。
..when my mum turned up I turned a corner, something lifted, it was physical.

507
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:20,740
雾已经在那里几个月了，就这样消失了，
This fog that's been there for months, it vanished, just like that,

508
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,700
一切都变得清晰起来，我觉得……
and everything became clear and I felt...

509
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:25,780
. .快乐。
..happy.

510
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:30,060
就像我多年来都不记得的感觉。
Like I can't remember feeling for years.

511
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:32,140
你不能把他搬进来。
You're not moving him in here.

512
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:34,340
这不是他。
It's not a he.

513
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:37,820
我想我们还是把这事解决掉吧。
I suppose we might as well get that out of the way.

514
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:41,260
我得告诉孩子们，还有我妈，
I need to tell the boys, and I need to tell my mother,

515
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:43,380
在我有机会亲自去做之前
and until I've had the chance to do that myself,

516
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:44,940
我希望你能谨慎一点。
I'd appreciate you being discreet.

517
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:48,300
你选择告诉谁当然是你的事
Whoever the hell else you choose to tell is of course your business

518
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:50,740
但很明显，我们必须解决这种可能性
but clearly we have to address the possibility that

519
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:53,820
这可能会让男孩们一开始感到不安，直到他们习惯了。
it might upset the boys initially, until they get used to it.

520
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:58,300
所以很明显，如果你需要尿尿并发表荒谬的评论
So obviously if you need to take the piss and make ridiculous comments

521
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:01,460
你最好是当着我的面说，而不是当着他们的面。
it'd be best if you did it straight to my face and not in front of them.

522
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:03,620
但作为一个思想自由的知识分子，
But being a liberal-minded intellectual,

523
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:05,700
我想你也不需要这么做了。
I assume you won't need to do that anyway.

524
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:08,980
是的。
Yeah.

525
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:10,100
电话响了

喂?
Hello?

528
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:16,580
我花了45英镑。这样可以吗?
I spent 45 quid. Is that all right?

529
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:18,660
哦，太棒了。
Oh, that's brilliant.

530
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:20,220
我有一件晨衣
I got a dressing-gown

531
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:23,260
为了你，为了她给你。
for you, well, for her to give to you.

532
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:26,700
只是一件白毛巾长袍。
It's just a white towel robe thing.

533
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:28,580
太好了，太好了。
Perfect, that's perfect.

534
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:31,180
如果你不想要，给我吧。不!
If you don't want it, I'll have it. No!

535
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:33,820
非常准确，谢谢。
It's spot-on, thank you.

536
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:36,180
如果你给我你的银行信息，我就把钱汇过去。
If you give me your bank details I'll transfer the cash.

537
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:38,740
我也会付她的东西。
I'll pay for her stuff as well.

538
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:39,900
嘿，这是作弊!
Hey, that's cheating!

539
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:40,980
是eck吗?
Is it 'eck!

540
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:44,340
顺便问一句，你的生日是什么时候?
When is it your birthday, by the way, out of interest?

541
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:46,740
因为明天是我的。
Just cos it's mine tomorrow.

542
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:48,300
明天。
Tomorrow.

543
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:50,020
你在开玩笑吧。
You're kidding.

544
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:52,580
明天是我的。
It's mine tomorrow.

545
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:56,260
这有多奇怪?
How weird is that?!

546
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:58,140
你多大了?你多大了?
How old are you? How old are you?

547
00:29:58,140 --> 00:29:59,820
我明天就好。
46, I will be tomorrow.

这是……
That's...

549
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,540
是吗?
Are you?

550
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:03,820
是的。
Yeah.

00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:05,940
哦，天哪!这有点……
Oh, good Lord! That's a bit...

552
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:08,220
我们是双胞胎!
We're twins!

553
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:10,980
嗯，我们是某种东西。
Well, we're something.

554
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:12,100
你是在耍我吗?
Are you winding me up?

555
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:13,900
不!
No!

556
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:15,900
我不知道。
I had no idea.

557
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:17,140
哦，他有一手好牌。
Oh, he's got a good hand.

我想知道那天晚上我们是否在想着对方。
I wonder if we were thinking about each other, that night.

569
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:07,700
他们受孕的那晚。
The night, you know, they were conceived.

That things were always meant to be, don't you?

不。你能做到的。
No. You can do.

00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:59,820
尽管我很想，

你怎么不在床上?
Why aren't you in bed?

你在和别人约会吗?
Are you seeing someone?

如果我是，你会怎么想?
How would you feel about it if I was?

633
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:58,940
没人看见。
No-one else saw.

634
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:02,340
我不会让你难堪的。我知道。
I won't embarrass you. I know.

635
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:05,660
如果你爸爸…我也不在乎

它是免费的，就在路边。

哦，你不应该这么做。你要结婚了。
Oh, you shouldn't have. You're getting married.

652
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:47,300
你需要所有的钱……闭嘴。
You're going to need all the money... Shut up.

653
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:48,340
干得好，爷爷。

666
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:20,860

谢谢,爸爸。

哈里说它的情况很好。

00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:27,340
哈利?因为它的年代久远。
Harry? For its vintage.

680
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:48,860

00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:50,260
是的，只是看看。
Yeah, just to have a look.

00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:53,380
是啊，是啊，我是说，如果你要走那条路。
Oh, well, yeah, yeah, I mean, if you're going that way.

我讨厌他。
I am sick of him,

686
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:16,740
我非常讨厌他。
I am sick to the back teeth of him.

00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:19,100
你只会惹麻烦。
You are nothing but trouble.

688
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:20,980
他真是个讨厌鬼。
Bloody nuisance, he is.

689
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:22,620
是啊，他不会再回来了!
Yeah, well he's not coming back 'ere!

690
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:26,500
你在和他乱搞之前就应该想到这一点。
Well, you should have thought about that before you started mucking about with him.

691
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:28,940
他陷入困境都是你的错。母狗!骗子!
It's your fault he's in this mess. Bitch! Liar!

692
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:32,060
我上车只是因为她说要带我去我奶奶家转转。
I only got in t'car cos she said she was taking me round me granny's.

693
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:33,780
你不能把他留在这里!
You're not leaving him here!

694
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:36,540
看我。你不是!
Watch me. You're not!

697
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:43,700
母狗!

698
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:44,980

她不是同性恋。
She's not a lesbian.

701
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:32,420
哦,好吧。那你怎么称呼它?
Oh, OK. So what would you call it, then?

702
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:35,060
如果她和别的女人上床。
If she's getting into bed with another woman.

703
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:36,340
不，她只是不是同性恋。
No, she's just not a lesbian.

704
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:38,980
不管她和另一个女人在做什么，她都不是…
Whatever it is she's doing with this other woman, she's not...

705
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:40,860
她看起来一点都不像同性恋。
She just doesn't look like a lesbian.

706
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:43,700
我知道女同性恋长什么样。我们校园里也有。
I know what lesbians look like. We have them on campus.

707
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:45,500
他们周一晚上在德文特酒吧见面。
They meet in Derwent Bar on Monday nights.

708
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:48,380
上帝!你是不是很古怪?你生活在哪个年代?
God! Aren't you quaint?! What decade do you live in?

709
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:50,900
你觉得她长得像…吗?哦，你从没见过她。
Do you think she looks like...? Oh, you've never seen her.

710
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:52,580
没有，但我对她有好感。
No, but I'm warming to her.

711
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:55,300
我想知道那是什么感觉。
I wonder what it's like.

712
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:56,380
怎么啦？
What?

713
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:58,460
和另一个女人做爱。
To get hot and steamy with another woman.

714
00:38:58,460 --> 00:38:59,500
上帝,
God, well,

715
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:02,180
我无法想象……那是什么?他们是做什么的?
I can't imagine it's... Well, what is it? What do they do?

716
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:04,780
他们没什么事可做，对吧?
They haven't got anything to do anything with, have they?

717
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:06,660
你是故意犯傻吗?
Are you being deliberately stupid?

718
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:10,900
不，当然不是，你只是在发泄。谁不想呢?
No, course not, you're just lashing out. Who wouldn't?

719
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:14,580
你刚刚发现你娶的那个女人…要多久?
You've just found out that the woman you've been married to...for how long?

720
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:15,980
18年。
18 years.

721
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:17,820
18岁!

00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:21,020
可能每次都是装的。
Has probably been faking it, every single time.

723
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:23,540
不，不，她没有，她不会，她不是…
No, no, she hasn't, she wouldn't, she's not...

724
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:25,940
要不就是每次你叫她来
Well, either that or every time you made her come

725
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:28,900
她假装你是，你知道，一个女孩。
she was pretending that you were, you know, a girl.

726
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,900
少女风，少女风!
A girly, a girly-whirly!

727
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:32,060
不不不，那是…
No, no, no, that's...

我们有…我和卡洛琳过得很好……
We had... Me and Caroline had fantastic...

729
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:36,700
你不知道人们在想什么。
You don't know what's in people's heads.

730
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:39,140
你不知道我跟你上床时脑子里在想什么。
You don't know what was in my head when I shagged you.

731
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:42,220
那是什么呢?我可能会想各种各样的。
Well, what is? Well, I could be thinking all sorts.

732
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:43,500
任何东西。
Anything.

733
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,060
是啊，怎么了?
Yeah, well, what?

734
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:46,140
我不会告诉你的!
I'm not telling you!

735
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,540
我被利用了。
I've been used.

736
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:51,740
不，你没有。
No, you haven't.

737
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:53,220
嗯，是的，你有。
Well, yeah, you have.

738
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:56,860
但每个人不是都在某个阶段吗?
But hasn't everybody at some stage?

这有关系吗?你昨晚睡在哪里?
Does it matter? Where did you sleep last night?

745
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:11,140
它不…我不是…这不关你的事……
It doesn't... I'm not... It's none of your...

746
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:12,980
你又搬出去了还是怎么的?
Have you moved out again or something?

747
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:14,580
不!好吧,好吧,
No! OK, well,

748
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:19,500

00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:26,700
好的。好吧，如果你加入
OK. Well, if you're in,

753
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:28,860
考虑到你住在那里
given that it's where you live,

754
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:30,180
我,呃……
I'd, er...

755
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:33,780
我希望你能加入我们。
I'd like you to join us.

756

你是认真的吗?
Are you serious?

757
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:37,580
是的，前提是你接受邀请
Yes, assuming you'd only accept the invitation

758
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:41,020
如果你想在孩子们面前表现得像个大人。
if you were going to behave like an adult in front of the children.

759
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:45,620
滚开，你这个伪善的，傲慢的疯婊子!
Piss off, you sanctimonious, patronising mad bitch!

760
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:52,500
问题吗?她邀请我和她一起吃晚饭，还有她……
Problem? She's invited me for dinner with her and her...

761
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:53,620
哦，你要去吗?
Oh, are you going?

762
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:55,860
不!你想知道她长什么样吗?
No! Do you want to know what she looks like?

763
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:58,580
不!我不想看到……
No! I don't want to see that...

764
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:01,700
坚持下去。怎么啦？
Hang on. What?

765
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:03,780
我的上帝!是她在花园里的那个女人
My God! It's that woman she had in the garden

766
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:05,700
当她把水泼在我身上时。
when she chucked all that water over me.

767
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:07,140
劳伦斯说她是女同性恋。
Lawrence said she was a lesbian.

768
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:09,580
去吧，去和他们一起吃饭吧。不!
Go on, go and have dinner with them. No!

769
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:11,300
哦,好吧。
Oh, OK.

770
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:12,340
耻辱。
Shame.

771
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:14,500
说实话，约翰，
Cos, thing is, to be frank, John,

772
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:15,900
我也不想让你在这里。
I don't want you here either.

773
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:18,740
我开始意识到你对我的影响有多坏。
I've started to realise what a bad influence you are on me.

774
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:36,180
这看起来很没有人情味。
It seems very impersonal.

775
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:40,460
我还在为教堂的事生气。
I'm still cross about the church.

776
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:42,940
也许如果她迁就我们
Maybe if she'd accommodated us,

777
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:45,900
那个牧师，我们会重新开始。
that vicar, we'd have started going again.

778
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:48,780
我认为她目光短浅。
I think she took a very short-term view.

779
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:50,660
那南弗洛姆呢?
What about Southowram?

780
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:53,540
嗯，他们确实提出了。
Well, they did offer.

781
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:57,140
你不是说野马不会把你拖回去吗。
I thought you said wild horses wouldn't drag you back there.

782
00:41:57,140 --> 00:42:00,380
是的，我知道，但如果这是唯一的地方…
Yes, I know I did, but if it's the only place...

783
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:01,940
不，那就不好了，对吧?
No, it's no good then, is it?

784
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:06,780
卡洛琳的学校里有个可爱的小教堂。
They have a lovely chapel at Caroline's school.

785
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:10,580
我去那里听过一次她组织的小型音乐会。
I went there once to a little concert she'd organised.

786
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:12,860
他们不把它租出去办婚礼吗?
Do they not hire it out for weddings?

787
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:14,140
谁?
Who?

788
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:15,420
这所学校!
The school!

789
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:19,540
你想在哈罗盖特结婚吗?
Would you want to get wed in Harrogate?

790
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:23,500
我不介意我们在哪里结婚，只要那是你想要的。
I don't mind where we get wed, as long as it's what you want.

我不太确定为什么给你打电话。只是…

00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:23,300
发生什么事了吗?
Has something happened?

804
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:26,500

You gave me such good advice that time, you know, when Caroline

805
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:28,020
开走了，没带我，然后……
drove off without me and...

806
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:29,340
有什么事吗?
What's up?

807
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:31,860
我能过来吗?
Can I come over?

808
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:34,620
如果你愿意的话。
If you like.

809
00:43:34,620 --> 00:43:35,700
你介意吗?
Would you mind?

810
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:37,300
不，当然不是。是什么……
No, course not. What's it...

811
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:39,620
这有什么用?
What's it to do with?

812
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:41,100
这是,这是……
It's, it's...

813

Or would you like to play Scrabble while Mum's cooking, if you like, or...?

829
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:27,420
天啊，我好几年没玩拼字游戏了。
God, haven't played Scrabble in years.

830
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:30,420
我去看看劳伦斯是否愿意。他不会拼写，但这对他有好处。
I'll see if Lawrence wants to. He can't spell, but it's good for him.

831
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:38,140
我告诉了他。他知道。
I told him. He knows.

832
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:40,180
他在这方面非常出色。
He's been brilliant about it.

833
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:45,220
我还没告诉劳伦斯。我只是在等合适的…
I've not told Lawrence. I'm just waiting for the right kind of...

834
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:46,820
是的。…。
Yeah. ...moment.

835
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:47,860
好的。
OK.

确定。
Sure.

838

约翰不是……吗?哦，我不知道约翰在哪里。

840
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:26,940

THEY SIGH

841
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:28,820
你知道，我的脚!
Do you know, my feet!

842
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:31,980
是啊，但我们现在有进展了。
Mm, yeah, but we're making progress now.

843
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:34,900
我们还是不知道我们住在哪里!
We still don't know where we're living!

844
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:38,740
我们可以在这里待几周再去哈罗盖特待几周。
Well, we could spend a few weeks here and then a few weeks over in Harrogate.

845
00:45:38,740 --> 00:45:41,380
我们可以隔一段时间换一次。
We could alternate at intervals.

846
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:43,740
那样的话，他们也会同样讨厌我们。
That way, they can all get equally sick of us.

847
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:47,460
是啊，我们也可以同样讨厌他们!
Yeah, and we can get equally sick of them!

848
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:51,540
哦，我不确定这顶帽子是否合适，我已经买了。
Oh, I'm not sure about this hat now I've bought it.

849
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:53,980
好吧，再买一个。你有三个星期的时间。
Well, buy another one. You've got three weeks.

850
00:45:53,980 --> 00:45:56,300

00:45:59,740 --> 00:46:02,180
什么，亲爱的?
What, my love?

854
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:05,700
我昨天告诉你的…
What I told you yesterday...

855
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:07,300
怎么了?
What about it?

856
00:46:08,340 --> 00:46:10,860
这是过失杀人。
Well, it were manslaughter.

857
00:46:10,860 --> 00:46:12,540
我不知道我说得是否清楚。
I don't know if I made that clear.

858
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:16,540
即使他试图结束自己的生命，她仍然可以……
Even though he'd tried to take his own life, she could've still...

859
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:17,580
艾伦吗?
Alan?

860
00:46:17,580 --> 00:46:19,380
这是遗忘。
It's forgotten.

861
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:22,900
我只是想知道…
Well, I just want to know that...

862
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:24,020
你意识到……
you realise...

863
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:27,540
听着，变老的好处之一是
Listen, one of the great things about getting older -

864
00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:29,380
我不知道你是否也有同样的感觉
I don't know if you feel the same -

865
00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:31,860
这一点还能让你震惊吗。
is that very little shocks you any more.

866
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:34,740
这当然不是。
And that certainly doesn't.

867
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:36,780
你知道的。
You know that.

868
00:46:39,980 --> 00:46:41,780
他高兴地叹了口气
HE SIGHS HAPPILY

869
00:46:44,140 --> 00:46:45,940
你有我的香水吗?
Have you got my perfume?

870
00:46:47,660 --> 00:46:50,660
西莉亚!我们一直逛到筋疲力尽!
Celia! We've shopped till we've dropped!

871
00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:53,940
约翰在这里。
John's here.

872
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:56,540
呃，他整个下午都在这儿。
Er, he's been here all afternoon.

873
00:46:56,540 --> 00:46:59,060
和的,嗯…他喝了点酒。
And, erm... he's had a bit to drink.

874
00:46:59,060 --> 00:47:02,260
怎么啦？而且他有点…情绪化。
What? And he's being a bit...emotional.

875
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:03,500
怎么了，出什么事了?
Why, what's happened?

876
00:47:04,580 --> 00:47:07,460
好吧，嗯……
OK, erm, well...

877
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:09,740
卡洛琳，嗯…
erm, Caroline, um...

878
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:10,860
她还好吗?
Is she all right?

879
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:12,780
她很好。她的……
She's fine. She's...

880
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:15,260
她的……她的……她的……她的……
She's... She's... She's... She's...

881
00:47:15,260 --> 00:47:16,700
她出车祸了吗?
Has she been in an accident?

882
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:18,940
不!不，不，不。午饭时她还好
No! No, no, no, no. She was all right at lunchtime

883
00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:21,540
当我们和她谈教堂的事时。不，她很好。
when we spoke to her about the chapel. No, she's fine.

884
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:24,340
她很好。这和那个没有关系。
She's fine. It's nothing to do with that.

885
00:47:24,340 --> 00:47:25,860
正确的。是西莉亚吗?
Right. Is that Celia?

886
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:29,220
听起来是这样。听着，伙计，你为什么不让吉莉安…
Yeah, sounds like it. Listen, pal, why don't you let Gillian...

887
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:31,300
Oi !西莉亚!
Oi! Celia!

888
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:32,660
他……
He...

00:47:33,820 --> 00:47:36,660
哦，约翰应该亲自告诉你，真的。不，卡罗琳。
Oh, John ought to tell you himself, really. Well, no, Caroline.

891
00:47:36,660 --> 00:47:39,100
对话在远处继续
CONVERSATION CONTINUES IN DISTANCE

892
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:43,220
问题是，约翰喝了点酒，他…
The thing is, John's had a bit to drink, and he's...

893
00:47:43,220 --> 00:47:45,380
西莉亚!哦,上帝。
Celia! Oh, God.

894
00:47:45,380 --> 00:47:47,580
发生了什么事? !但是什么也没有发生。
What's happened?! Nothing's happened.

895
00:47:47,580 --> 00:47:49,220
你在这里做什么?
What are you doing here?

896
00:47:49,220 --> 00:47:50,740
来找吉莉安。
Came to see Gillian.

897
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:53,180
你喝了多少酒?
How much have you had to drink?

898
00:47:53,180 --> 00:47:56,260
负载。卡罗琳出什么事了吗?
Loads. Has something happened with Caroline?

899
00:47:56,260 --> 00:47:58,340
嗯，是的，你可以这么说。
Well, yeah, you could kind of say that.

900
00:47:58,340 --> 00:48:00,860
不,这是……约翰，你醉得很厉害。记住这一点
No, it's... John, you're very drunk. Just bear that in mind

901
00:48:00,860 --> 00:48:02,820
在你说别的之前。
before you say anything else.

902
00:48:02,820 --> 00:48:05,860
谁能告诉西莉亚发生了什么事?
Can someone kindly tell Celia what's going on?

903
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:11,460
你知道卡洛琳是同性恋吗?
Did you know that Caroline's a lesbian?

904
00:48:14,420 --> 00:48:16,420
他在说什么?
What's he talking about?

905
00:48:16,420 --> 00:48:19,260
你知道吗?你知道我和这个女人结过婚吗?
Did you know that? Did you know that I've been married to this woman?

906
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:21,860
你想知道我为什么出轨吗?这个女人,
And you wonder why I had an affair? This woman,

907
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:23,700
19年来
who for 19 years

908
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:25,900
要么是装的，要么是…

909
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:27,300
闭嘴。
Shut up.

910
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:29,900
吉莉安，让他闭嘴。
Gillian, shut him up.

911
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:31,580
这话说得真他妈傻。
What a bloody silly thing to say.

912
00:48:31,580 --> 00:48:33,420
你知道我是什么感觉吗?
Do you know how that makes me feel?

913
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:37,500
你那可笑的女儿…嘿，别再说这种话了。
Your ridiculous bloody daughter... Hey, that's enough of that sort of talk.

914
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:41,420
他到底在这里做什么?他为什么在这里让人心烦?
What's he doing here, anyway? Why's he here upsetting people?

915
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:44,420
艾伦!约翰，你惹她生气了。我才不管呢!
Alan! John, you're upsetting her. I don't care!

916
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:47,260
嗯，我知道。来吧，我们到外面去吧。别碰我!
Well, I do. Come on, let's take it outside. Get your hands off me!

917
00:48:47,260 --> 00:48:49,140
我希望你冷静下来。
I want you to calm down.

918
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:51,540
说这种话真是太恶毒了。
That's wicked, coming out with something like that.

919
00:48:51,540 --> 00:48:53,300
你都告诉谁了?
And who've you been telling it to?

920
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:54,620
我这么说是因为这是真的
I'm saying it cos it's true,

921
00:48:54,620 --> 00:48:56,980
因为她和另一个女人有一腿!
cos she's been having it off with another woman!

922
00:48:56,980 --> 00:48:59,660
把他弄开。来吧，出去。
Get him out of the way. Come on, outside.

923
00:48:59,660 --> 00:49:02,220
你在干什么?出去!
What are you doing? Get outside!

924
00:49:02,220 --> 00:49:03,980
什么女人?
What woman?

925
00:49:03,980 --> 00:49:07,900
来……过来坐下。我给你泡点茶。
Come... Come and sit down. I'll make you some tea.

926
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:10,020
我不想喝茶!
I don't want any tea!

927
00:49:10,020 --> 00:49:11,860
我想回家。
I want to go home.

928
00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:15,980
在学校吗?在教堂里。
At school? In the chapel.

929
00:49:15,980 --> 00:49:18,580
然后我们去别的地方举行招待会。
Then we'll move on to somewhere else for the reception.

930
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:21,620
我正在为他们找几个可能的场地。
I'm checking out a few possible venues for them.

931
00:49:21,620 --> 00:49:24,340
那会很棒的。会很漂亮的。
It'll be fantastic. It'll be gorgeous.

932
00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:26,860
这正是她想要的。太神奇了。你的妈妈!
It'll be just what she wants. It's so amazing. Your mum!

933
00:49:26,860 --> 00:49:29,100
我知道!我知道，这很完美。
I know! I know, it's perfect.

934
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:30,740
这是美妙的。
It's wonderful.

935
00:49:30,740 --> 00:49:32,140
这是她应得的。
It's what she deserves.

936
00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:35,740
即使她等了这么久才拿到。
Even if she's had to wait all this time to get it.

937
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:40,020
我能喝醉吗?不。
Can I get drunk? No.

00:50:13,620 --> 00:50:16,820
我想向他道歉。
I wanted to apologise to him.

953
00:50:16,820 --> 00:50:20,020
但我猜你现在在这里，所以…
But I guess that you're here now, so...

954
00:50:21,220 --> 00:50:22,420
你见过他吗?
Have you seen him?

955
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:24,820
今天早上。但是，你知道，一切都结束了。
This morning. But, you know, it's over.

956
00:50:24,820 --> 00:50:26,420
很好。
It's good.

957
00:50:26,420 --> 00:50:29,300
即便如此，我也不想伤害他。
Even so, I don't want to hurt him.

958
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:32,860
嘿，听着，这太棒了!

抱歉?
Sorry?

961
00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:39,380
我曾经有过

我对我爸一个女朋友的疯狂迷恋。

所以，你知道，我支持你。
So, you know, I'm right there with you.

你在说什么?
What are you talking about?

965
00:50:47,980 --> 00:50:51,340
我曾经想象过亲吻她的感觉。
I used to imagine what it might be like to snog her.

966
00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:53,340
要我帮你叫辆出租车吗?不。
Would you like me to call you a taxi? No.

你知道，到最后，
You know, in the end,

971
00:51:00,220 --> 00:51:02,500
也许这不全是他的错。
maybe it wasn't entirely his fault.

972
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:04,740
我不是在为他辩护。无用的娘们儿。
Not that I'm defending him. Useless twat.

973
00:51:04,740 --> 00:51:07,460
但肯定有什么办法，不是吗，不管用，
But there's got to be something, hasn't there, not working,

00:54:39,660 --> 00:54:41,620
她叹了口气
SHE SIGHS

1039
00:55:05,020 --> 00:55:06,100
帮助你自己。
Help yourself.

1040
00:55:09,580 --> 00:55:10,900
愚蠢的家伙。
Dozy bugger.

1041
00:55:14,220 --> 00:55:16,180
我想……
I suppose...

1042
00:55:16,180 --> 00:55:18,740
你不会相信我的……
you won't believe me...

1043
00:55:18,740 --> 00:55:21,700
如果我说我不是来这里做这个的
if I said I didn't really come over here to do that.

1044
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:26,340
那只是个借口，真的……
It was just an excuse, really...

1045
00:55:27,780 --> 00:55:28,940
．.再次见到你。
..to see you again.

1046
00:55:30,820 --> 00:55:31,860
我已经……
I've...

1047
00:55:31,860 --> 00:55:33,500
一直在想你。
kept thinking about you.

1048
00:55:57,300 --> 00:55:58,620
他叹了口气
HE SIGHS

1049
00:56:00,180 --> 00:56:03,220
对不起，我需要让眼睛休息五分钟。
Sorry, I need to rest me eyes for five minutes.

1050
00:56:05,660 --> 00:56:06,980
你想喝杯咖啡吗?
Would you like a cup of coffee?

1051
00:56:08,340 --> 00:56:09,620
嗯，我们可以。
Mm, we can do.

1052
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:15,700
他会错了。
He'll have t'wrong end of t'stick.

1053
00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:17,340
环她!
Ring her!

1054
00:56:18,460 --> 00:56:19,660
不。
No.

1055
00:56:19,660 --> 00:56:20,940
要我给她打个电话吗?
Would you like me to ring her?

1056
00:56:20,940 --> 00:56:22,300
不!
No!

1057
00:56:33,780 --> 00:56:35,020
我不能决定....
I can't decide....

1058
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:38,300
．.如果你是一个邪恶的家伙
..if you're an evil git

1059
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:41,820
或者这真的很讨人喜欢
or if it's actually quite...flattering

1060
00:56:41,820 --> 00:56:43,900
你这么用心也很浪漫
and romantic that you'd go to such lengths

1061
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:47,420
而且会让很多人非常生气
and piss so many people off so massively

1062
00:56:47,420 --> 00:56:49,180
只是为了找个借口来看我。
just to have an excuse to come and see me.

1063
00:56:49,180 --> 00:56:51,620
都不是，不是……
None of it, it wasn't...

1064
00:56:51,620 --> 00:56:52,940
这不是我计划的。
I didn't plan it.

1065
00:56:54,940 --> 00:56:56,780
我也不可怕。
And I'm not horrible.

1066
00:56:56,780 --> 00:56:59,300
就像你一样……
Just like you...

1067
00:56:59,300 --> 00:57:00,900
说。
said.

1068
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:03,700
拉夫什么时候生你的气。我只是…
About when Raff got annoyed with you. I'm just...

1069
00:57:05,980 --> 00:57:07,380
．.令人失望的人。
..disappointingly human.

1070
00:57:20,340 --> 00:57:21,860
你想上楼吗?
Do you want to go upstairs?

1071
00:57:32,660 --> 00:57:36,460
她叫桑给巴尔，但我简称她为凯特，
She's called Zanzibar, but I just call her Kate for short,

1072
00:57:36,460 --> 00:57:38,060
这是更容易。
it's easier.

1073
00:57:38,060 --> 00:57:40,020
我想我还是搬出去比较好。
I think it would be better if I moved out.

1074
00:57:40,020 --> 00:57:43,020
卡洛琳是怎么变成拉拉的。
What's up with Caroline being a bit of a dyke anyway.

1075
00:57:43,020 --> 00:57:45,420
他认为我应该见见凯特。
He thinks I should meet Kate.

1076
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:46,460
进来。
Come in.

1077
00:57:46,460 --> 00:57:48,660
你还好吗?是的，会是消化不良。
Are you all right? Yeah, it'll be indigestion.

1078
00:57:48,660 --> 00:57:51,780
今晚唯一会有损失的人就是她。
The only one who's got anything to lose this evening is her.

1079
00:57:51,780 --> 00:57:54,380
当我看到她碰你的时候，我反胃了。
Turned my stomach when I saw her touch you.

1080
00:57:54,380 --> 00:57:56,340
抱歉，你说什么了吗?不。
Sorry, did you say something? Nope.

1081
00:57:56,340 --> 00:58:00,100
她对卡罗琳说话的方式让我很失望，我很震惊。
She disappointed me the way she talked to Caroline, I were shocked.

1082
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:03,140
你不会跟她闹翻的，对吧?爸爸?
You're not going to fall out with her though, are you? Dad?
