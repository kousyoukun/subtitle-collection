1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,680
Where would you like to get wed,
you can get wed anywhere now.

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:05,990
We got shut in. We're not burglars,
we're pensioners.

3
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:08,980
Where the hell are they?

4
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:12,180
Whatever has happened, he'll be
looking after her. I know that.

5
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:13,860
Do you think they're dead?

6
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:16,260
You couldn't lend me some money,
could you?

7
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:17,980
Two months rent, that's it now.

8
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:22,300
Gillian, they're fine. They've been
playing cards and eating chocolate.

9
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:24,460
Dozy...!

10
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:29,420
Do you seriously think I haven't
slept with other people?

11
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:31,780
What are you doing with that
dipstick? We make an all right team,

12
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:34,500
you, me and Raff, couldn't we?

13
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:38,260
I'm seeing someone. I don't know if
it's what I want entirely yet.

14
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:40,900
Someone at work?
I won't know if I don't try.

15
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:42,900
Who is it then?
No-one. Why is it a secret?

16
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:45,740
Kate, hello.

17
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:47,820
Are you teaching?

18
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,820
Good.

19
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:52,820
Could you come to my office?

20
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:54,940
Yes, now, would you mind?

21
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:01,220
Caroline! We weren't expecting you.

22
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:02,540
How's your mum?

23
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:03,740
Fine. Yes.

24
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:05,220
Is she traumatised?

25
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:06,460
Um...

26
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:10,500
..don't know.

27
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,860
I, um...I don't think so. I was,

28
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:14,700
I feel all, um...

29
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:17,460
something else now.

30
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:19,300
Exhilarated.

31
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,660
Shock, possibly.

32
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:23,260
Can I get you some tea?
I think Alison's just made a pot.

33
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:26,180
Oh, has she? Oh, good. Um, yes.
Thank you.

34
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:35,460
What?

35
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:51,860
Oh... Oh...

36
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,060
I, um...told John.

37
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:00,020
About us?
God, it felt good.

38
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:02,740
Better, um...tuck that back in.

39
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:05,100
Beverley'll be in any minute
with the tea.

40
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,940
Oh, good.

41
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:08,620
Caroline...do you...

42
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:11,100
do you want to come round tonight?

43
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,260
Yup.

44
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:14,900
So presumably your mum...

45
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:16,620
Turned up, she's fine.
You all right?

46
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:19,460
I was awake all night, came home,
went to bed, couldn't sleep,

47
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:21,380
so I think I'm a bit, um...wired?

48
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:22,660
Is that a word? It's...

49
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,860
Yes, it's a very good word.

50
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:27,180
You're very pretty.

51
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:28,940
Am I? Mmm.

52
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:30,580
You're magnificent.

53
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:42,460
Wouldn't that be
technically difficult?

54
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:44,500
Sure we'll think of something.

55
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:49,900
Tea! Ah! Thank you.

56
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:52,620
Kate, can I get you one?
I should have asked.

57
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:54,220
No. Thanks, I'm...

58
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:58,780
I rearranged your meeting
with the chairman of the board
of governors at two.

59
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,540
Should I see
if he's still able to make it?

60
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,060
Um...

61
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:05,780
yup, if he's, um...still available.

62
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:07,340
Have you had any lunch?

63
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:09,020
Nope. Can I get you some?

64
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:11,140
No. Well, maybe, in a bit.

65
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,740
You really all right?

66
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,500
Caroline.

67
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:37,740
I thought she was dead last night.

68
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:39,460
I thought they both were.

69
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:45,100
And there was this one moment
when I thought...

70
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,140
that's it.

71
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:51,420
And I couldn't stand it because I
thought, "How unfair would that be,

72
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:55,580
"to have met this one person again
after all these years,
and then died."

73
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:05,060
I'm sitting on the floor
in my own office.

74
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:06,740
Yeah, I'd spotted that.

75
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,860
It's the relief, is it?

76
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:11,740
Do you think maybe
you should be at home after all?

77
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:14,380
No.

78
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:19,380
I'll see Gavin at two
and then I might as well wait
till quarter past three.

79
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:24,060
Will you be at home by four o'clock?

80
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,140
I can be.

81
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:05,580
We escaped.

82
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:07,140
We did!

83
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:08,980
We keep having adventures.

84
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:10,220
We do!

85
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:12,820
I didn't have much in the way
of adventures until I met you.

86
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:15,060
Eh, eh, eh! You needn't look at me.

87
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:18,460
It's you that gets us
into these shenanigans. Hardly!

88
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:22,620
Well, it were your idea,
going up Southowram. Was it?

89
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:23,740
You...

90
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:25,040
Oh. OK.

91
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:39,180
It's odd. Weren't it? That...well,
whatever it were last night.

92
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:42,380
There were a distinct presence,
weren't there?

93
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:46,140
I just can't shake it off.

94
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:50,020
Well, we're here now.

95
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:51,260
Aren't we?

96
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:54,700
Back in the land of the living. So...

97
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:59,380
You know...

98
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:01,740
I told you about when Eddie died?

99
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:03,940
Yeah.

100
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:06,700
How he killed himself? Yeah.

101
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:10,580
Well, there were a bit more to it
than I'd said, and...

102
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:13,780
I think it's summat I ought
to tell you about.

103
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:15,460
Before we get wed.

104
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:16,540
What?

105
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:20,140
Unh! Oh, bloody hell.

106
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:22,780
Oh, hell's bells.

107
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:23,980
Who is he when he's at home?

108
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:25,460
Ouch! Do you know him?

109
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:28,660
Yes.
Are you going to introduce us?

110
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:31,780
Right, well, that is Paul.

111
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:33,100
Hello, Mr Buttershaw.

112
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,380
This is Celia.

113
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:35,860
You all right, love?

114
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:37,780
You've been in the wars. Yeah.

115
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:39,140
Oh!

116
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:40,220
Tell me about it.

117
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:42,500
Paul? Gi... Oh.

118
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,340
Ah. Is it all right if I put
t'kettle on, Mr Buttershaw?

119
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:48,460
Only I'm supposed to keep me fluids
up and I think Gillian's forgot.

120
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:54,060
See, somebody at the door now.
What were you going to tell me?

121
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:55,580
I'll... Later.

122
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:57,300
Ah...

123
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,700
Oh! Ah.

124
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:03,300
Do you need a hand up?

125
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:07,780
Hey! You're not dead, then.
How's Celia?

126
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:10,100
Is it Tuesday?

127
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,380
I'm in a pub.

128
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:15,380
I'm having trouble
with the reception.

129
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:16,500
We're in a bit of a dip,

130
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,540
can you hear me?
Loud and clear.

131
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:21,940
He goes out for a bit of lunch
every Tuesday with his pals.

132
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:23,420
And they've asked me along.

133
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:24,500
That's nice.

134
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,620
Yeah.

135
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:28,980
Anyway, the reason I'm ringing
is because I've decided

136
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:31,860
to stop a few days
while we sort out the wedding.

137
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:36,580
Only the thing is, I've not got
a clean change of underwear.

138
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:40,180
OK, so...? So you couldn't
pop over, could you?

139
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:41,980
With some...

140
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:46,060
with some knickers and a...and
a nightie, and me toothbrush?

141
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:48,540
Like a little overnight bag,
sort of business.

142
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:50,620
Well, Mum, I would,
but I've got a school to run.

143
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:52,580
You've not gone to work?!

144
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:54,100
You've been up all night!

145
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,180
Could you get Alan
to pop into Halifax with you?

146
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:58,140
They'll have an M&S, surely, or...

147
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:00,060
Oh, right. Don't worry about me!

148
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:03,020
Well, I would, but...
Hmm. I get the picture.

149
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:05,540
Can I ring you later?
If you've time.

150
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:07,660
Is that OK? It'll have to be.

151
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:08,820
So I'll ring you later.

152
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:10,860
I could have caught
a chill last night.

153
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:13,180
I could have caught pneumonia.

154
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:14,580
Yes, but you didn't.

155
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:19,020
All the same, I should be taking it
steady, not traipsing into Halifax.

156
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:20,100
You're in a pub.

157
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:24,060
What do you want for your birthday?
Can I ring you later?

158
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:25,780
Only I never know what to get you.

159
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:27,380
Yes, can I ring you later?

160
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:29,900
If I don't get you anything,
you'll say I'm being off with you.

161
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:32,380
Mum... How old are you this time?

162
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:35,500
Mum! I'm in a meeting.
Who are you in a meeting with?

163
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,900
The chairman of the
board of governors.

164
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:42,220
Oh, that smarmy beggar.
Well, you can tell him to eff off.

165
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,900
From me. Right.

166
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,020
I'll ring you later.

167
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:47,380
Yeah, don't knock yourself out.

168
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:50,100
I will ring you. Later. Hmm.

169
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,900
Think what you want
for your birthday.

170
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:54,540
Get me something from Marks's
when you go buying your necessaries.

171
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:55,780
Bye-bye.

172
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:56,860
Bye.

173
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,300
She sends her regards.

174
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:08,220
Do you want a straw, love?
Actually...

175
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:10,980
How much?

176
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:15,140
He's asking 4,000. He'll take less.
Well, what condition's it in?

177
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:17,100
Oh, you'd have to take it
for a test drive.

178
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:21,500
Well, I can't imagine her getting
more than a few thousand off
insurance.

179
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:24,780
If that.
Still, it's her birthday tomorrow.

180
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:26,380
Gillian's? Is it?

181
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:30,380
So I'm thinking, happen I could
make up the difference for her.

182
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,140
How old is she?

183
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:34,580
Um...40-summat.

184
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:39,460
You want me to ring up, see if he's
around this aff so you can have a go
with it?

185
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:42,780
Yeah, sure. Why not? I'll pop
outside, see if I can get a signal.

186
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:44,100
Right.

187
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:53,580
Now, Alan, have you
thought about a best man?

188
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:56,060
No, not yet, not really.

189
00:10:56,060 --> 00:11:01,020
You see, I'm used to a certain
degree of public speaking.

190
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:04,060
Having been on t'council
all them years. Of course.

191
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:06,700
And I can be very amusing,
of course.

192
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:12,180
I was often complimented on
my humorous turn of phrase and wit

193
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:13,740
and illuminating insights.

194
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:16,300
Yeah, yeah.

195
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:19,860
Then there's the, um, other aspect.

196
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:21,900
Is there? Which?

197
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,340
Not losing the ring.

198
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:25,980
Turning up on time.

199
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:28,900
Sober. All that side.

200
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:30,740
Yeah, well... Obviously.

201
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:36,460
Shall I break it to him, then?
Or will you?

202
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:38,140
Sorry? Harry.

203
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:39,740
Oh! What have I missed?

204
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:44,220
We've bought you a
medium-dry white wine, Celia.

205
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:46,220
Oh! That's lovely, thank you.

206
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:48,940
Harry's lad's friend's
selling a Land Rover.

207
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:51,300
I thought we could pop up
and have a look at it

208
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:54,580
for our Gillian this after.
Oh, very good.

209
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:58,900
I hope you're not taking painkillers
and drinking alcohol.

210
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:03,060
Can you fetch us a straw, love?

211
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:06,300
Don't mention owt to Harry yet.

212
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:09,940
Let me deal with that side
of things. OK.

213
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:20,860
Dad?

214
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,300
Dad?

215
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:38,660
Dad?!

216
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:54,100
Hello?

217
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:58,740
Oh, that's...useful. Well done, Dad.

218
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,140
Sorry. Caroline, it's Gillian.

219
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:14,500
I'm sorry to be ringing you,
only... How are you?

220
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,820
You haven't... They've...

221
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,460
They're not... They're not here.

222
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:21,220
I mean, they were here and now
they're not. You haven't...seen them,
have you?

223
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:22,940
They were in a pub. Sorry?

224
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:26,700
My mother rang, about an hour ago.
They were in a pub with some friends
of Alan's.

225
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:30,660
Pillock! Yeah, it's Tuesday.

226
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:32,620
I, um, panicked.

227
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:36,900
I've been out working all morning
and then when I came in
and they weren't here

228
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,420
and the car gone...

229
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:39,860
You all right?

230
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:40,980
I just...

231
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:48,380
Gillian? It's brought it home to me.

232
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:51,260
Last night.

233
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:55,220
I don't think I could stand it
if I lost him.

234
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:57,380
Not just yet.

235
00:13:57,380 --> 00:14:01,420
Especially not since he's met
your mum again, he's been so happy.

236
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:04,380
Sorry.

237
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:06,460
Don't be sorry.

238
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:09,340
Perhaps you should give me
your mum's mobile number.

239
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:12,260
For future reference.
I've got a feeling...

240
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:15,260
I'm going to need it if they're
going to carry on like this.
Sure.

241
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:17,620
Which I get the idea they are.

242
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:19,300
Oh, um...

243
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:22,540
you couldn't do me a favour,
Gillian, could you?

244
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:28,820
Hello.

245
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,020
It's Gillian!

246
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:31,340
Hello, love!

247
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:33,900
You don't know what's happened
to Paul, do you?

248
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,820
The fella that was... Paul?

249
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,500
Yes, he's here, he's with us.

250
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,700
He was going stir crazy at home.

251
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:42,700
Were you wanting to speak to him?

252
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:43,740
No!

253
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:45,020
Where are you?

254
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:47,580
I'm...I'm not entirely sure.

255
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:48,780
Where are we, Alan?

256
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:50,300
Up Soyland.

257
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:53,300
We're up Soyland!

258
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,940
We're up Soyland!

259
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:57,620
Right. OK.

260
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:01,420
Can you tell my dad... Are Harry
and Maurice with you?

261
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:03,460
Yes. Yes, they are, love.

262
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:06,740
Right, can you tell my dad
to tell Harry and Maurice

263
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:10,860
to take Paul home to his mother's?
They know where he lives.

264
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:13,220
And to leave him there, right?

265
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:15,460
And not to bring him back to ours.

266
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:16,540
Yes!

267
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,180
Yes, I can do that.

268
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:20,940
Fabulous! Oh!

269
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:23,100
And, Celia! Yes, love.

270
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,300
Knickers.

271
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,460
Um...

272
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:28,460
I've spoken to Caroline.

273
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:31,340
I'm going into Halifax,
what sort do you want?

274
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:32,620
Well, um...

275
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:34,340
And what size?

276
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:36,540
I'm struggling to hear you,

277
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:38,860
I think the signal's going.

278
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:41,340
Hello? I think we're stuck.

279
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:43,940
I'm going to have to go.
We'll be fine.

280
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:46,380
Now, I'm hanging up now.
Hello?

281
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,740
What's that smell?

282
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:49,580
That smell, I'm afraid to say...

283
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:51,700
It's like tomatoes.

284
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:54,060
It's like metal tomatoes.

285
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:58,300
That smell is the smell
of a buggered clutch, Alan.

286
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:01,980
Oh, aye, did I not say?
Lad said it'd need a new clutch.

287
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:05,940
We can pop to McNally's scrap yard
and get a re-whatsited one for about
70 quid.

288
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:11,060
Other than that, I'd say it's in
damn near pretty perfect condition.

289
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,860
Hi.

290
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:34,220
Hi.

291
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,780
Shit.

292
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:56,940
Oh.

293
00:16:58,740 --> 00:16:59,780
Hello?

294
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:07,820
Right, so...the thing is, what
size knickers does your mum wear?

295
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:12,380
Only when I rang her
she couldn't tell me herself

296
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:15,700
cos she was embarrassed cos
me dad and Harry and Maurice
were there with her

297
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,900
so... Oh, I...I...I...

298
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:21,220
I don't really...
Cou...cou...you, um...

299
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:23,300
um... Why don't I just...?

300
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:24,940
(Who is it?)
It's Gillian.

301
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:28,060
..just buy a few different sorts
and a few different sizes?

302
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:31,460
What does she want? She wants
to know what size knickers
my mother wears.

303
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:34,380
And then any that aren't suitable
I can just take back.

304
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:36,220
They'll be fine with that,
won't they?

305
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:38,100
Yeah! If they're unopened.

306
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,380
Y...yeah. Yeah, course they will.

307
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:42,100
Good idea.

308
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,460
OK, sorry to bother you.

309
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:44,700
No problem.

310
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,900
Thank you. Ta-ra.

311
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,260
I owe you one.

312
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:50,140
Bye. Bye.

313
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:51,780
What?

314
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,060
What's wrong with that?

315
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:58,100
100.

316
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,940
No...

317
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:01,100
Will you take 75?

318
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:03,180
Ah, go on.

319
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:13,660
I've been meaning to say, Alan,
regarding t'wedding...

320
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:18,780
..you'll want a best man
that people like, won't you?

321
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:21,220
You won't want somebody
who'll drone on,

322
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:23,060
talk about himself

323
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:25,700
ad infinitum for 40 minutes.

324
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:27,860
Cos you know that's what'll happen.

325
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:31,060
Whereas, thing is...

326
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:34,380
..I've never been a best man.

327
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:37,780
And, um, it's summat
I'd like to do...

328
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:39,860
once, before I die.

329
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:43,180
Well, I'll, um...

330
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:46,340
Yeah, yeah. I'll...

331
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:47,540
Smashing.

332
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:52,100
Shall I tell him? Or will you?

333
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:54,300
Yeah, I'll... Yeah, leave it to me.

334
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:18,700
So what are you going to do?
Well, I don't know.

335
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,260
Can you have two best men?

336
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:22,820
No. It'd look daft.

337
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:25,180
Well, I'll have
to worry about that tomorrow.

338
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:26,540
Like Scarlett O'Hara.

339
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:29,060
Are you suited with it?

340
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:30,820
Oh, I think so.

341
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:33,420
We'll shut it in here,
she'll have a surprise in t'morning.

342
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:37,060
What were you going
to tell me earlier?

343
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:38,980
When that lad fell down the stairs.

344
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:40,940
Oh.

345
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:41,980
Yeah.

346
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,860
Let's put t'kettle on, eh?

347
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:10,420
It may sound summat and nowt
when I say it, but...

348
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:14,820
They'd been arguing,
this is what Gillian told me after.

349
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:17,100
He'd been drinking, Eddie had.

350
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:19,740
Threatening to...kill himself.

351
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:24,220
Then she found him,
he were in t'barn,

352
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:26,660
he'd smashed his head open
with t'log splitter.

353
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:29,580
But the thing is...

354
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:32,900
when she found him, he weren't dead.

355
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:35,180
And not only that...

356
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:39,500
He were still conscious.

357
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:44,980
Then I got here about, ooh...an hour
after it had happened, and...

358
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:50,340
..she'd called police by that
stage, by that stage he were dead.

359
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:52,980
She told me...

360
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:56,540
..she just stood there...

361
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:00,420
..and watched him slip away.

362
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:03,540
Right in front of her.

363
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:05,580
Rather than get help.

364
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:10,060
So that's why...

365
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:15,020
Anyway.

366
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:17,220
Why what?

367
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:19,500
Robbie.

368
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:22,540
The others thought
summat untoward had gone on.

369
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:24,580
That...she had killed him,

370
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:26,140
which were nonsense, she didn't.

371
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:29,740
But she didn't call
an ambulance either.

372
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:33,460
She told me what she'd done
as soon as I got here,

373
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:36,100
which I suppose makes me
complicit in it.

374
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:40,300
I don't blame her.

375
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,060
Not for a second.

376
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:45,140
He made her life a misery
and there were no way under t'sun

377
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:47,220
I were going to shop her
to the police.

378
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:52,220
So, I wanted you to know
that I did that,

379
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:57,740
because, strictly speaking,
it weren't right. But...

380
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:01,460
Anyway, that's it.

381
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:02,860
Are you shocked?

382
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:05,100
No.

383
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,140
Are you disappointed?

384
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:07,340
No.

385
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,340
No.

386
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:15,940
I told you about Kenneth, what
I'd have done given half a chance.

387
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:17,660
You thought about it, we did it.

388
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:18,860
You didn't.

389
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:20,020
I covered it up.

390
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,820
Don't tell Gillian I've told you.
No, I won't.

391
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:27,500
Ever. Promise me. I promise.

392
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,380
And I keep my promises.

393
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:33,460
It sort of bought it back
last night.

394
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:36,780
There's always been
a funny feeling in that barn since.

395
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:41,340
I do sometimes wonder
if he's still in there.

396
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:42,700
Let it go.

397
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:47,660
I'm glad you've told me,
but now let it go.

398
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:49,660
You don't think less of me?

399
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:52,500
No, never.

400
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:57,620
I love you.

401
00:22:57,620 --> 00:23:00,180
I love you.

402
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:05,300
Sorry.

403
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,980
We've gone all miserable.

404
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:11,060
We don't want that, do we? No.

405
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:13,700
We need to be laughing, you and me!

406
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:14,780
Hey.

407
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:17,900
Do you remember all that jiving
we used to do?

408
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:21,460
Oh, gosh.

409
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:23,660
Do I remember?!

410
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:27,340
(Little Richard's
"Tutti Frutti" plays)

411
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:18,580
Oh, no!
No, don't mind me.

412
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:20,220
We were just... Good!

413
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:23,380
...reminiscing.
You should reminisce more often!

414
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:25,420
Oh heck, now you'll be
telling everybody.

415
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:28,220
Smashing photos.

416
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:29,660
I'm texting 'em to Caroline.

417
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:32,980
Did you get rid of him?
Hey? Paul.

418
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:35,260
Oh, yes. Well, yes.

419
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:37,900
Harry took him in his Mondeo.

420
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:39,700
Good job well done.

421
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:41,380
Celia?

422
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:43,220
Knickers.

423
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:46,740
Owt that doesn't fit or isn't right
we'll take back.

424
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:48,860
Oh, thanks. How much do I owe you?

425
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:51,460
There's a receipt in there
somewhere.

426
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:54,260
And, I rung Robbie.
Him and Raff are coming round
for supper.

427
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:55,340
Robbie?!

428
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:56,580
Yeah, tonight.

429
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:58,260
Raff's bringing his stuff back.

430
00:24:58,260 --> 00:24:59,340
He's moving back in.

431
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:01,020
So,

432
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:04,700
I bought a chicken
and a couple of bottles of wine.

433
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:07,820
Ooh! We're celebrating.
What are we celebrating?

434
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:10,660
Everything, anything.
You name it, we'll celebrate it.

435
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:13,220
Well, I'll just go upstairs
and sort myself out.

436
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:16,060
Do you know where you're going?
Yes, thanks, love.

437
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:18,460
Robbie was really on it last night,
Dad.

438
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:21,420
He really bothered,
really surprised me,

439
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:25,460
and he apologised for all the crap
and nonsense and rubbish.

440
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:28,340
I think he were genuine.

441
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:31,620
That bed'll need a clean sheet
and another duvet cover.

442
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:32,860
Oh, and Celia?

443
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:37,500
I got this for Caroline.

444
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:42,100
She said to get her something
from M&S for you to give to her
for her birthday.

445
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:44,260
She said it would be
a weight off your mind,

446
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:46,260
or her mind,
or one of your minds, yeah?

447
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:47,460
Thanks.

448
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:09,940
Don't worry, he's gone.

449
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:11,060
He better have.

450
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:26,340
Where have you been?

451
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:29,940
Work. Till this time?

452
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:32,260
Boys all right?

453
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:33,420
Where have you been?

454
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:34,860
Where haven't I been?

455
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:37,060
Just...tell me who it is.

456
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:38,140
No.

457
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:41,620
I won't get cross.
Ooh, lucky me(!)

458
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:43,540
Are you making it up?

459
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:44,580
How's Judith?

460
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:47,940
I finished with Judith. I don't want
to see her again as long as I live.

461
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:50,500
Is she pretty, Judith?
I've never asked you.

462
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:52,620
She's... No, actually,
she's rather ugly.

463
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:55,340
When you've seen her
fall down the stairs more than once

464
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:58,860
and wet herself vomiting, it's hard
to think of her as anything else.
Who is it?

465
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:02,660
There are other people,
more important people, who need
to know before you.

466
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:03,740
Why? Just say it.

467
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:06,700
Is it that unctuous git that's
chairman of your board of...?

468
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:07,780
Gavin!

469
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:11,580
Anyway, he's married, with children.

470
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:14,020
Do you think I'd do that?

471
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:19,140
I thought the idea was we were
going to try to make it work here,

472
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:20,220
for the boys.

473
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:23,140
Only as a practical arrangement
until they got off to university.

474
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:26,380
You must have known I was never
really going to get back into bed
with you.

475
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:28,540
So I'm just going to live here
while you sleep around?

476
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:31,100
I'm not going to sleep around,
but you could.

477
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:34,140
Actually, if I'm with someone else
and you're going to sleep around...

478
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:37,580
I don't want to sleep around.
..we might as well just call it
a day and get divorced.

479
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:39,180
You're not having the house.

480
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:41,460
I'm having the boys,
because I never walked out on them,

481
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:44,340
and no court in its right mind would
throw them out of the family home.

482
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:46,460
Caroline. Get yourself a good lawyer.
I intend to.

483
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:49,180
Caroline, I don't want
to get divorced.

484
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:50,940
Well, I'm sorry,
I've come full circle.

485
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:53,460
If I love and trust someone
enough to have sex with them

486
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:56,380
I don't want them relegated to the
Fourth Division, I want them here.

487
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:57,940
Where I can have them.

488
00:27:57,940 --> 00:28:00,100
Any time I like.

489
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:03,780
Do you know what I realised
last night?

490
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:05,860
I've been depressed.

491
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:07,300
For months.

492
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:09,700
And last night I was so low

493
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:12,100
I hit rock bottom, and then...

494
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:17,460
..when my mum turned up I turned
a corner, something lifted,
it was physical.

495
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:20,740
This fog that's been there for
months, it vanished, just like that,

496
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,700
and everything became clear
and I felt...

497
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:25,780
..happy.

498
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:30,060
Like I can't remember feeling
for years.

499
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:32,140
You're not moving him in here.

500
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:34,340
It's not a he.

501
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:37,820
I suppose we might as well
get that out of the way.

502
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:41,260
I need to tell the boys,
and I need to tell my mother,

503
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:43,380
and until I've had the chance to do
that myself,

504
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:44,940
I'd appreciate you being discreet.

505
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:48,300
Whoever the hell else you choose to
tell is of course your business

506
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:50,740
but clearly we have
to address the possibility that

507
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:53,820
it might upset the boys initially,
until they get used to it.

508
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:58,300
So obviously if you need to take the
piss and make ridiculous comments

509
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:01,460
it'd be best if you did it straight
to my face and not in front of them.

510
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:03,620
But being a liberal-minded
intellectual,

511
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:05,700
I assume you won't need
to do that anyway.

512
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:08,980
Yeah.

513
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:11,660
You might need to think about it.

514
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:13,220
Hello?

515
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:16,580
I spent 45 quid. Is that all right?

516
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:18,660
Oh, that's brilliant.

517
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:20,220
I got a dressing-gown

518
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:23,260
for you, well,
for her to give to you.

519
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:26,700
It's just a white towel robe thing.

520
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:28,580
Perfect, that's perfect.

521
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:31,180
If you don't want it,
I'll have it. No!

522
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:33,820
It's spot-on, thank you.

523
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:36,180
If you give me your bank details
I'll transfer the cash.

524
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:38,740
I'll pay for her stuff as well.

525
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:39,900
Hey, that's cheating!

526
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:40,980
Is it 'eck!

527
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:44,340
When is it your birthday,
by the way, out of interest?

528
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:46,740
Just cos it's mine tomorrow.

529
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:48,300
Tomorrow.

530
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:50,020
You're kidding.

531
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:52,580
It's mine tomorrow.

532
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:56,260
How weird is that?!

533
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:58,140
How old are you?
How old are you?

534
00:29:58,140 --> 00:29:59,820
46, I will be tomorrow.

535
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:01,300
That's...

536
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,540
Are you?

537
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:03,820
Yeah.

538
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:05,940
Oh, good Lord! That's a bit...

539
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:08,220
We're twins!

540
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:10,980
Well, we're something.

541
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:12,100
Are you winding me up?

542
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:13,900
No!

543
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:15,900
I had no idea.

544
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:17,140
Oh, he's got a good hand.

545
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:21,180
Ey! Oi! You're never going to
believe this - this is weird.

546
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:32,500
Hello? Are you sober?

547
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:33,820
Why?

548
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:38,180
It's funny, it sort of teases you
out of thought, doesn't it?

549
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:41,420
I mean, how t'heck
could that have happened?

550
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:44,580
I mean, you couldn't invent that,
could you?

551
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:53,420
You know I told you I used to think
about you, when I was with Kenneth?

552
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:56,380
And you said you used to think about
me, sometimes?

553
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:57,540
Yeah.

554
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:03,500
I wonder if we were thinking
about each other, that night.

555
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:07,700
The night, you know,
they were conceived.

556
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:11,420
I think it's just another sign.

557
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:16,140
That things were always meant to be,
don't you?

558
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:22,500
I'd better go back down,
help Gillian wi' t'washing up.

559
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,140
Or else I'll be in bother.

560
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:25,300
Oh...

561
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,900
Let's just have a few more minutes.

562
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:35,060
Thanks for bringing him back, Rob.

563
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,380
No problem.

564
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:37,740
You're all right.

565
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:40,340
When you're not being a twillock!

566
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:42,380
Yeah? Thanks, Gillian.

567
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:50,020
'Ey, and, you know...

568
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:53,380
..thanks.

569
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:54,620
For last night.

570
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:58,980
I'm glad we talked about stuff.

571
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:02,500
Are you doing owt?
Tomorrow, for your birthday?

572
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:05,300
Nah.

573
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:10,180
Do you fancy going out for a meal?

574
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:12,260
Or summat,

575
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:13,860
some time?

576
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:16,060
Yeah.

577
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:18,700
Why not?

578
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:52,300
Do you want to stay?

579
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:57,380
No. You can do.

580
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:59,820
As much as I'd like to,

581
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:04,260
ask me when you're less likely
to regret it the morning after.

582
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:06,020
I'm not pi...

583
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:08,740
I'm not that pissed.

584
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:13,340
Night, Gillian.

585
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:14,900
Coward.

586
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:18,020
Night night.

587
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:20,420
Night.

588
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,540
(Mum. Mum?)

589
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:36,100
Hello.

590
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:37,420
You should go to bed.

591
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:39,620
Hmm.

592
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:48,260
Oh...

593
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:50,140
Where's Dad?

594
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:52,340
Has he gone out? I don't know.

595
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:54,580
Why aren't you in bed?

596
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:01,380
Are you seeing someone?

597
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:05,180
How would you feel about it
if I was?

598
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:06,620
Fine.

599
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:09,180
If it's someone that deserves you.

600
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:11,460
OK.

601
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:14,500
Well then, yes I am.

602
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:15,780
Seeing someone.

603
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:22,620
Is it Kate McKenzie?

604
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:23,980
What...

605
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:26,860
..makes you think that?

606
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:29,380
Is it?

607
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:31,860
OK, well, if...

608
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:35,340
If it, if, if it, erm...

609
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:36,780
it was...

610
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:40,140
..what would, how would you...

611
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:41,980
She's nice! I like her.

612
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:43,460
She's clever,

613
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:45,820
she's interesting, she's kind.

614
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:47,500
How...

615
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:48,820
How did you know?

616
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:50,340
I saw you.

617
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:53,220
When you came in
to invigilate for my exam yesterday,

618
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:55,860
just the way you looked
at each other.

619
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:58,940
No-one else saw.

620
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:02,340
I won't embarrass you. I know.

621
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:05,660
This wouldn't have happened
if your dad... I don't care.

622
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:08,220
I want you to be happy.

623
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:09,340
Lawrence know?

624
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:10,380
No.

625
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:17,180
Happy birthday.

626
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:26,460
Right, this
had better be good.

627
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:27,860
Ready? Yep.

628
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:29,460
Steady? No!

629
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:30,980
Ta-da!

630
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:33,620
Dad!

631
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:35,900
It goes.

632
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:38,860
How much did you...

633
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:39,900
Nowt!

634
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:41,220
We found it.

635
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:42,860
It were free, at side of t'road.

636
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:45,060
Oh, you shouldn't have.
You're getting married.

637
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:47,300
You're going to need all the
money... Shut up.

638
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:48,340
Nice one, Grandad.

639
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:49,380
It's...

640
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:52,140
...beautiful. It's...

641
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:57,340
..got wheels and everything!

642
00:35:57,340 --> 00:36:00,140
I said to t'fella, only the best,
it's for our Gillian.

643
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:01,660
You...

644
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:02,900
Dad!

645
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:06,380
Only thing is, the clutch has gone.

646
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:09,060
So I've bought a new one,

647
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:12,020
well, a re-whatsited one,
is on t'front seat.

648
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:14,060
So you'll...

649
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:16,180
Be having to put that in myself.

650
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:19,020
Well, you like mucking about
inside engines, don't you? So...

651
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:20,860
Yeah.

652
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:22,100
Thanks, Dad.

653
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:25,340
Harry says otherwise
it were in perfect condition.

654
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:27,340
Harry? For its vintage.

655
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:31,900
You pillock!

656
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:34,220
Right, I'm off.
Happy birthday, Mother.

657
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:36,020
Oh!

658
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:37,860
See you, Gramps. Ta-ta, Celia.

659
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:40,020
Bye, love.
Hey, do you want a lift?

660
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:41,260
In this?

661
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:42,860
Not in that.

662
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:44,020
In that!

663
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:47,820
Yeah, me and Celia are going to
t'registry office in Halifax, so...

664
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:48,860
Are you?

665
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:50,260
Yeah, just to have a look.

666
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:53,380
Oh, well, yeah, yeah,
I mean, if you're going that way.

667
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:10,980
Out. Get off me, bitch!

668
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:12,460
I am not having him.

669
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:14,100
I am sick of him,

670
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:16,740
I am sick to the back teeth of him.

671
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:19,100
You are nothing but trouble.

672
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:20,980
Bloody nuisance, he is.

673
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:22,620
Yeah, well he's not
coming back 'ere!

674
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:26,500
Well, you should have thought
about that before you started
mucking about with him.

675
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:28,940
It's your fault he's in this mess.
Bitch! Liar!

676
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:32,060
I only got in t'car cos she said
she was taking me round me granny's.

677
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:33,780
You're not leaving him here!

678
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:36,540
Watch me. You're not!

679
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:42,100
I'll get t'keys for t'car.
Do you want to get in, Raffy?

680
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:43,700
Bitch!

681
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:44,980
Raff?

682
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:30,060
She's not a lesbian.

683
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:32,420
Oh, OK. So what would you call it,
then?

684
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:35,060
If she's getting into bed
with another woman.

685
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:36,340
No, she's just not a lesbian.

686
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:38,980
Whatever it is she's doing
with this other woman, she's not...

687
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:40,860
She just doesn't look like a lesbian.

688
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:43,700
I know what lesbians look like.
We have them on campus.

689
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:45,500
They meet in Derwent Bar
on Monday nights.

690
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:48,380
God! Aren't you quaint?!
What decade do you live in?

691
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:50,900
Do you think she looks like...?
Oh, you've never seen her.

692
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:52,580
No, but I'm warming to her.

693
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:55,300
I wonder what it's like.

694
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:56,380
What?

695
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:58,460
To get hot and steamy
with another woman.

696
00:38:58,460 --> 00:38:59,500
God, well,

697
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:02,180
I can't imagine it's...
Well, what is it? What do they do?

698
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:04,780
They haven't got anything
to do anything with, have they?

699
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:06,660
Are you being deliberately stupid?

700
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:10,900
No, course not, you're just
lashing out. Who wouldn't?

701
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:14,580
You've just found out that
the woman you've been married
to...for how long?

702
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:15,980
18 years.

703
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:17,820
18 years!

704
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:21,020
Has probably been faking it,
every single time.

705
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:23,540
No, no, she hasn't,
she wouldn't, she's not...

706
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:25,940
Well, either that
or every time you made her come

707
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:28,900
she was pretending that you were,
you know, a girl.

708
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,900
A girly, a girly-whirly!

709
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:32,060
No, no, no, that's...

710
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:34,380
We had... Me and Caroline
had fantastic...

711
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:36,700
You don't know what's
in people's heads.

712
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:39,140
You don't know what was in
my head when I shagged you.

713
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:42,220
Well, what is?
Well, I could be thinking all sorts.

714
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:43,500
Anything.

715
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,060
Yeah, well, what?

716
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:46,140
I'm not telling you!

717
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,540
I've been used.

718
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:51,740
No, you haven't.

719
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:53,220
Well, yeah, you have.

720
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:56,860
But hasn't everybody at some stage?

721
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:01,940
It's her.

722
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:04,660
Oh, shall I answer it?

723
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:05,780
Yes?

724
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:06,940
Where are you?

725
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:09,140
Does it matter?
Where did you sleep last night?

726
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:11,140
It doesn't... I'm not...
It's none of your...

727
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:12,980
Have you moved out again
or something?

728
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:14,580
No! OK, well,

729
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:19,500
I'm planning to cook tonight for
my birthday for my, erm...friend.

730
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,540
And the boys.

731
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:22,820
I want to know if you'll be
in or out.

732
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:24,700
I don't know where I'll be.

733
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:26,700
OK. Well, if you're in,

734
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:28,860
given that it's where you live,

735
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:30,180
I'd, er...

736
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:33,780
I'd like you to join us.

737
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:35,540
Are you serious?

738
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:37,580
Yes, assuming
you'd only accept the invitation

739
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:41,020
if you were going to behave like an
adult in front of the children.

740
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:45,620
Piss off, you sanctimonious,
patronising mad bitch!

741
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:52,500
Problem? She's invited me
for dinner with her and her...

742
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:53,620
Oh, are you going?

743
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:55,860
No! Do you want to know
what she looks like?

744
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:58,580
No! I don't want to see that...

745
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:01,700
Hang on. What?

746
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:03,780
My God! It's that woman
she had in the garden

747
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:05,700
when she chucked
all that water over me.

748
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:07,140
Lawrence said she was a lesbian.

749
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:09,580
Go on, go and have dinner
with them. No!

750
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:11,300
Oh, OK.

751
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:12,340
Shame.

752
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:14,500
Cos, thing is, to be frank, John,

753
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:15,900
I don't want you here either.

754
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:18,740
I've started to realise
what a bad influence you are on me.

755
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:36,180
It seems very impersonal.

756
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:40,460
I'm still cross about the church.

757
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:42,940
Maybe if she'd accommodated us,

758
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:45,900
that vicar,
we'd have started going again.

759
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:48,780
I think she took
a very short-term view.

760
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:50,660
What about Southowram?

761
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:53,540
Well, they did offer.

762
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:57,140
I thought you said wild horses
wouldn't drag you back there.

763
00:41:57,140 --> 00:42:00,380
Yes, I know I did,
but if it's the only place...

764
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:01,940
No, it's no good then, is it?

765
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:06,780
They have a lovely chapel
at Caroline's school.

766
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:10,580
I went there once to
a little concert she'd organised.

767
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:12,860
Do they not hire it out
for weddings?

768
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:14,140
Who?

769
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:15,420
The school!

770
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:19,540
Would you want
to get wed in Harrogate?

771
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:23,500
I don't mind where we get wed,
as long as it's what you want.

772
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:02,340
Hello?

773
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:03,780
Gillian, hello, it's John.

774
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:04,820
Elliott.

775
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:06,140
Caroline's... Oh, hello.

776
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:08,460
Who is it?
I'm sorry I'm ringing you.

777
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:09,540
I...

778
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:11,060
What's happening? Anything?

779
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:13,980
I was just wondering...
The thing is...

780
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:16,580
Oh, dear.

781
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:18,180
Are you all right?

782
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:21,660
I'm not entirely certain
why I'm ringing you. Just...

783
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:23,300
Has something happened?

784
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:26,500
You gave me such good advice that
time, you know, when Caroline

785
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:28,020
drove off without me and...

786
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:29,340
What's up?

787
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:31,860
Can I come over?

788
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:34,620
If you like.

789
00:43:34,620 --> 00:43:35,700
Would you mind?

790
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:37,300
No, course not. What's it...

791
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:39,620
What's it to do with?

792
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:41,100
It's, it's...

793
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:42,820
Just say it.

794
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:44,260
Caroline.

795
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:45,300
Caroline?

796
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:47,460
Is she all right?

797
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:05,660
Hi.

798
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:06,860
Come in.

799
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:07,900
Hello, William.

800
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:09,060
Hi.

801
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:10,420
For you.

802
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:11,900
Happy birthday!

803
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:15,260
William, can you take
Kate's coat, please?

804
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:18,380
Dinner's going to be
another 40 minutes, sorry.

805
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:19,780
It's fine, I'll help you.

806
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:20,980
Thanks, William.

807
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:25,580
Or would you like to play
Scrabble while Mum's cooking,
if you like, or...?

808
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:27,420
God, haven't played
Scrabble in years.

809
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:30,420
I'll see if Lawrence wants to.
He can't spell,
but it's good for him.

810
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:38,140
I told him. He knows.

811
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:40,180
He's been brilliant about it.

812
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:45,220
I've not told Lawrence. I'm just
waiting for the right kind of...

813
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:46,820
Yeah. ...moment.

814
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:47,860
OK.

815
00:44:58,020 --> 00:44:59,740
Are you going to stay tonight?

816
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:00,860
Sure.

817
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:04,740
Is John not...?
Oh, I haven't a clue where John is.

818
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:28,820
Do you know, my feet!

819
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:31,980
Mm, yeah, but
we're making progress now.

820
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:34,900
We still don't know
where we're living!

821
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:38,740
Well, we could spend
a few weeks here and then
a few weeks over in Harrogate.

822
00:45:38,740 --> 00:45:41,380
We could alternate at intervals.

823
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:43,740
That way, they can all get
equally sick of us.

824
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:47,460
Yeah, and we can get
equally sick of them!

825
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:51,540
Oh, I'm not sure about
this hat now I've bought it.

826
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:53,980
Well, buy another one.
You've got three weeks.

827
00:45:53,980 --> 00:45:56,300
Yeah. Bugger the expense.

828
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:58,460
Buy the cat a goldfish.

829
00:45:58,460 --> 00:45:59,740
Celia?

830
00:45:59,740 --> 00:46:02,180
What, my love?

831
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:05,700
What I told you yesterday...

832
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:07,300
What about it?

833
00:46:08,340 --> 00:46:10,860
Well, it were manslaughter.

834
00:46:10,860 --> 00:46:12,540
I don't know if I made that clear.

835
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:16,540
Even though he'd tried to take
his own life, she could've still...

836
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:17,580
Alan?

837
00:46:17,580 --> 00:46:19,380
It's forgotten.

838
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:22,900
Well, I just want to know that...

839
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:24,020
you realise...

840
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:27,540
Listen, one of the great things
about getting older -

841
00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:29,380
I don't know if you feel the same -

842
00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:31,860
is that very little shocks
you any more.

843
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:34,740
And that certainly doesn't.

844
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:36,780
You know that.

845
00:46:44,140 --> 00:46:45,940
Have you got my perfume?

846
00:46:47,660 --> 00:46:50,660
Celia!
We've shopped till we've dropped!

847
00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:53,940
John's here.

848
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:56,540
Er, he's been here all afternoon.

849
00:46:56,540 --> 00:46:59,060
And, erm...
he's had a bit to drink.

850
00:46:59,060 --> 00:47:02,260
What?
And he's being a bit...emotional.

851
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:03,500
Why, what's happened?

852
00:47:04,580 --> 00:47:07,460
OK, erm, well...

853
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:09,740
erm, Caroline, um...

854
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:10,860
Is she all right?

855
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:12,780
She's fine. She's...

856
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:15,260
She's... She's... She's... She's...

857
00:47:15,260 --> 00:47:16,700
Has she been in an accident?

858
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:18,940
No! No, no, no, no.
She was all right at lunchtime

859
00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:21,540
when we spoke to her about the
chapel. No, she's fine.

860
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:24,340
She's fine.
It's nothing to do with that.

861
00:47:24,340 --> 00:47:25,860
Right. Is that Celia?

862
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:29,220
Yeah, sounds like it. Listen, pal,
why don't you let Gillian...

863
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:31,300
Oi! Celia!

864
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:32,660
He...

865
00:47:32,660 --> 00:47:33,820
She, er...

866
00:47:33,820 --> 00:47:36,660
Oh, John ought to tell you himself,
really. Well, no, Caroline.

867
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:43,220
The thing is, John's had
a bit to drink, and he's...

868
00:47:43,220 --> 00:47:45,380
Celia! Oh, God.

869
00:47:45,380 --> 00:47:47,580
What's happened?!
Nothing's happened.

870
00:47:47,580 --> 00:47:49,220
What are you doing here?

871
00:47:49,220 --> 00:47:50,740
Came to see Gillian.

872
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:53,180
How much have you had to drink?

873
00:47:53,180 --> 00:47:56,260
Loads.
Has something happened with Caroline?

874
00:47:56,260 --> 00:47:58,340
Well, yeah, you could
kind of say that.

875
00:47:58,340 --> 00:48:00,860
No, it's... John, you're very drunk.
Just bear that in mind

876
00:48:00,860 --> 00:48:02,820
before you say anything else.

877
00:48:02,820 --> 00:48:05,860
Can someone kindly tell Celia
what's going on?

878
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:11,460
Did you know that
Caroline's a lesbian?

879
00:48:14,420 --> 00:48:16,420
What's he talking about?

880
00:48:16,420 --> 00:48:19,260
Did you know that? Did you know that
I've been married to this woman?

881
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:21,860
And you wonder why I had an affair?
This woman,

882
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:23,700
who for 19 years

883
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:25,900
has been either faking it or...

884
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:27,300
Shut up.

885
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:29,900
Gillian, shut him up.

886
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:31,580
What a bloody silly thing to say.

887
00:48:31,580 --> 00:48:33,420
Do you know how that makes me feel?

888
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:37,500
Your ridiculous bloody daughter...
Hey, that's enough
of that sort of talk.

889
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:41,420
What's he doing here, anyway?
Why's he here upsetting people?

890
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:44,420
Alan! John,
you're upsetting her. I don't care!

891
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:47,260
Well, I do. Come on, let's take it
outside. Get your hands off me!

892
00:48:47,260 --> 00:48:49,140
I want you to calm down.

893
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:51,540
That's wicked, coming out
with something like that.

894
00:48:51,540 --> 00:48:53,300
And who've you been telling it to?

895
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:54,620
I'm saying it cos it's true,

896
00:48:54,620 --> 00:48:56,980
cos she's been having it off
with another woman!

897
00:48:56,980 --> 00:48:59,660
Get him out of the way.
Come on, outside.

898
00:48:59,660 --> 00:49:02,220
What are you doing? Get outside!

899
00:49:02,220 --> 00:49:03,980
What woman?

900
00:49:03,980 --> 00:49:07,900
Come... Come and sit down.
I'll make you some tea.

901
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:10,020
I don't want any tea!

902
00:49:10,020 --> 00:49:11,860
I want to go home.

903
00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:15,980
At school? In the chapel.

904
00:49:15,980 --> 00:49:18,580
Then we'll move on to somewhere else
for the reception.

905
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:21,620
I'm checking out a few
possible venues for them.

906
00:49:21,620 --> 00:49:24,340
It'll be fantastic.
It'll be gorgeous.

907
00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:26,860
It'll be just what she wants.
It's so amazing. Your mum!

908
00:49:26,860 --> 00:49:29,100
I know! I know, it's perfect.

909
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:30,740
It's wonderful.

910
00:49:30,740 --> 00:49:32,140
It's what she deserves.

911
00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:35,740
Even if she's had to wait
all this time to get it.

912
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:40,020
Can I get drunk? No.

913
00:49:43,620 --> 00:49:45,260
Oh! Hello!

914
00:49:46,340 --> 00:49:47,500
Er...

915
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:48,660
can I help you?

916
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:50,940
Sorry, I dropped a bottle of wine.

917
00:49:50,940 --> 00:49:53,220
Just now. It was...

918
00:49:53,220 --> 00:49:54,420
meant to be a present.

919
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:57,740
Are you...Caroline?

920
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:02,580
I was looking for John. Is he in?

921
00:50:03,860 --> 00:50:05,500
Judith?

922
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:07,020
Yeah.

923
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:09,180
No, he's not in.
I don't know where he is.

924
00:50:09,180 --> 00:50:11,220
Oh. Right.

925
00:50:12,220 --> 00:50:13,620
I think I've upset him.

926
00:50:13,620 --> 00:50:16,820
I wanted to apologise to him.

927
00:50:16,820 --> 00:50:20,020
But I guess that
you're here now, so...

928
00:50:21,220 --> 00:50:22,420
Have you seen him?

929
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:24,820
This morning. But, you know,
it's over.

930
00:50:24,820 --> 00:50:26,420
It's good.

931
00:50:26,420 --> 00:50:29,300
Even so, I don't want to hurt him.

932
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:32,860
And hey, listen, it's great!

933
00:50:32,860 --> 00:50:35,100
I'm really cool with it. Well done.

934
00:50:36,180 --> 00:50:37,860
Sorry?

935
00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:39,380
I used to have

936
00:50:39,380 --> 00:50:43,460
this horrendous crush
on one of my dad's girlfriends.

937
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:46,620
So, you know, I'm right there
with you.

938
00:50:46,620 --> 00:50:47,980
What are you talking about?

939
00:50:47,980 --> 00:50:51,340
I used to imagine
what it might be like to snog her.

940
00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:53,340
Would you like me to call you
a taxi? No.

941
00:50:53,340 --> 00:50:55,060
And listen...

942
00:50:55,060 --> 00:50:56,140
Caroline...

943
00:50:56,140 --> 00:50:57,580
I'm sorry I...

944
00:50:57,580 --> 00:51:00,220
You know, in the end,

945
00:51:00,220 --> 00:51:02,500
maybe it wasn't entirely his fault.

946
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:04,740
Not that I'm defending him.
Useless twat.

947
00:51:04,740 --> 00:51:07,460
But there's got to be something,
hasn't there, not working,

948
00:51:07,460 --> 00:51:09,420
before a bloke...

949
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:11,220
goes off? Mind where you're...

950
00:51:12,740 --> 00:51:13,860
Judith!

951
00:51:15,660 --> 00:51:18,260
What are you doing?!
I'm helping you!

952
00:51:18,260 --> 00:51:20,860
Kate! Was that Caroline?

953
00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:53,620
He's asleep.

954
00:51:53,620 --> 00:51:55,820
What a puff.

955
00:51:55,820 --> 00:51:57,820
Fainting!

956
00:51:59,100 --> 00:52:01,340
You don't have to stay, you know.
I can handle things.

957
00:52:01,340 --> 00:52:04,940
I'm 15. I'll stay here with you
until your mum gets back.

958
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:09,740
She's seeing someone. Mum.

959
00:52:09,740 --> 00:52:11,780
Did you know? Yes.

960
00:52:11,780 --> 00:52:13,540
Yes.

961
00:52:13,540 --> 00:52:14,740
I did know.

962
00:52:15,740 --> 00:52:17,540
Who?

963
00:52:19,060 --> 00:52:20,300
Well...

964
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:23,780
I expect she'll talk it through
with you when she's ready.

965
00:52:23,780 --> 00:52:26,340
"Talk it through"? What do you mean?

966
00:52:29,220 --> 00:52:30,540
Will that be her?

967
00:52:31,780 --> 00:52:33,780
Hello? Hi. Is that William?

968
00:52:33,780 --> 00:52:34,860
Lawrence.

969
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:36,340
Lawrence.

970
00:52:36,340 --> 00:52:39,300
Hi. Er, it's Gillian,
Alan's daughter.

971
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:40,900
Is Caroline there?

972
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:44,020
No, she's had to rush
somebody into hospital.

973
00:52:44,020 --> 00:52:46,140
Oh. Er...

974
00:52:46,140 --> 00:52:47,660
Oh, erm...

975
00:52:47,660 --> 00:52:51,060
Um...that'll be why
she hasn't been picking up

976
00:52:51,060 --> 00:52:53,140
her mobile, then. Why?

977
00:52:53,140 --> 00:52:54,740
Well, cos...

978
00:52:56,180 --> 00:52:58,700
Can you give her a message from me
when she gets back?

979
00:52:58,700 --> 00:52:59,900
Yep.

980
00:52:59,900 --> 00:53:00,940
Can you tell her...

981
00:53:00,940 --> 00:53:03,060
er...

982
00:53:03,060 --> 00:53:07,100
her mother's driving over
with me dad in the dark.

983
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:08,780
I couldn't stop them. I tried.

984
00:53:08,780 --> 00:53:12,460
And you know, neither of them's
eyesight is that good. But, er,

985
00:53:12,460 --> 00:53:15,140
I wanted to just warn her

986
00:53:15,140 --> 00:53:18,100
that she's upset. Erm, Celia.

987
00:53:18,100 --> 00:53:19,860
You, your granny. She's upset...

988
00:53:20,860 --> 00:53:24,980
..cos she's found out
about this relationship, erm...

989
00:53:24,980 --> 00:53:26,940
Caroline's been having...

990
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:31,300
..with, er, with...with...

991
00:53:31,300 --> 00:53:32,700
Kate.

992
00:53:34,820 --> 00:53:36,180
Yeah.

993
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:38,420
Kate.

994
00:53:38,420 --> 00:53:40,140
What, you knew?

995
00:53:41,180 --> 00:53:43,460
Yeah.

996
00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:47,980
OK.

997
00:53:47,980 --> 00:53:51,140
Right. I'll...I'll tell her.

998
00:53:52,380 --> 00:53:53,420
Bye.

999
00:53:53,420 --> 00:53:54,940
Bye.

1000
00:53:59,140 --> 00:54:00,780
What?

1001
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:04,660
Raff's gone to bed.

1002
00:54:04,660 --> 00:54:07,820
I'm going to get off. I'm up at six.

1003
00:54:07,820 --> 00:54:08,860
OK.

1004
00:54:08,860 --> 00:54:12,140
Are you all right with this joker,
or do you want me to deposit him
somewhere?

1005
00:54:12,140 --> 00:54:15,780
No, leave him. He's upset.
He can sleep down here

1006
00:54:15,780 --> 00:54:19,380
with Paul. I'll find him a duvet.

1007
00:54:19,380 --> 00:54:20,460
Right.

1008
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:23,580
Night. Night.

1009
00:54:31,140 --> 00:54:32,780
Night. Night.

1010
00:55:05,020 --> 00:55:06,100
Help yourself.

1011
00:55:09,580 --> 00:55:10,900
Dozy bugger.

1012
00:55:14,220 --> 00:55:16,180
I suppose...

1013
00:55:16,180 --> 00:55:18,740
you won't believe me...

1014
00:55:18,740 --> 00:55:21,700
if I said I didn't really
come over here to do that.

1015
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:26,340
It was just an excuse, really...

1016
00:55:27,780 --> 00:55:28,940
..to see you again.

1017
00:55:30,820 --> 00:55:31,860
I've...

1018
00:55:31,860 --> 00:55:33,500
kept thinking about you.

1019
00:56:00,180 --> 00:56:03,220
Sorry, I need to rest me eyes
for five minutes.

1020
00:56:05,660 --> 00:56:06,980
Would you like a cup of coffee?

1021
00:56:08,340 --> 00:56:09,620
Mm, we can do.

1022
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:15,700
He'll have t'wrong end of t'stick.

1023
00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:17,340
Ring her!

1024
00:56:18,460 --> 00:56:19,660
No.

1025
00:56:19,660 --> 00:56:20,940
Would you like me to ring her?

1026
00:56:20,940 --> 00:56:22,300
No!

1027
00:56:33,780 --> 00:56:35,020
I can't decide....

1028
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:38,300
..if you're an evil git

1029
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:41,820
or if it's actually
quite...flattering

1030
00:56:41,820 --> 00:56:43,900
and romantic that you'd go
to such lengths

1031
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:47,420
and piss so many people off
so massively

1032
00:56:47,420 --> 00:56:49,180
just to have an excuse
to come and see me.

1033
00:56:49,180 --> 00:56:51,620
None of it, it wasn't...

1034
00:56:51,620 --> 00:56:52,940
I didn't plan it.

1035
00:56:54,940 --> 00:56:56,780
And I'm not horrible.

1036
00:56:56,780 --> 00:56:59,300
Just like you...

1037
00:56:59,300 --> 00:57:00,900
said.

1038
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:03,700
About when Raff got annoyed
with you. I'm just...

1039
00:57:05,980 --> 00:57:07,380
..disappointingly human.

1040
00:57:20,340 --> 00:57:21,860
Do you want to go upstairs?

1041
00:57:32,660 --> 00:57:36,460
She's called Zanzibar, but I just
call her Kate for short,

1042
00:57:36,460 --> 00:57:38,060
it's easier.

1043
00:57:38,060 --> 00:57:40,020
I think it would be better if
I moved out.

1044
00:57:40,020 --> 00:57:43,020
What's up with Caroline being
a bit of a dyke anyway.

1045
00:57:43,020 --> 00:57:45,420
He thinks I should meet Kate.

1046
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:46,460
Come in.

1047
00:57:46,460 --> 00:57:48,660
Are you all right?
Yeah, it'll be indigestion.

1048
00:57:48,660 --> 00:57:51,780
The only one who's got anything to
lose this evening is her.

1049
00:57:51,780 --> 00:57:54,380
Turned my stomach when
I saw her touch you.

1050
00:57:54,380 --> 00:57:56,340
Sorry, did you say something? Nope.

1051
00:57:56,340 --> 00:58:00,100
She disappointed me the way she
talked to Caroline, I were shocked.

1052
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:03,140
You're not going to fall out
with her though, are you? Dad?
