2
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,199
I mean, I'd never have been able to
bring him

3
00:00:50,261 --> 00:00:53,600
somewhere like this, you see.
Your dad. No.

4
00:00:53,744 --> 00:00:55,184
Cos he'd dribble.

5
00:00:56,864 --> 00:00:59,343
I tried to keep him neat.

6
00:00:59,344 --> 00:01:02,543
If we went to, like,
the cafe in Sainsbury's,

7
00:01:02,544 --> 00:01:06,023
I'd sit with my back to the wall
and him facing me.

8
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:07,543
Well, I had to.

9
00:01:07,544 --> 00:01:09,264
It's off-putting for folk, isn't it?

10
00:01:09,265 --> 00:01:12,544
They've come out for a coffee,
seeing someone like that.

11
00:01:15,104 --> 00:01:17,743
You're feeling sorry for him,
aren't you?

12
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:19,943
No, I'm...
Yes, well, don't.

13
00:01:19,944 --> 00:01:23,743
I looked after him, and it's more
than he would have done for me.

14
00:01:23,744 --> 00:01:25,303
I told you about the pension?

15
00:01:25,304 --> 00:01:26,503
Yes.

16
00:01:26,504 --> 00:01:28,743
No provision for me.
No.

17
00:01:28,744 --> 00:01:30,423
He were thinking I'd go first.

18
00:01:30,424 --> 00:01:32,383
Well, yes, but...
But what?

19
00:01:32,384 --> 00:01:34,064
It's not like you're without,
is it?

20
00:01:34,065 --> 00:01:36,064
That isn't the point!

21
00:01:37,744 --> 00:01:40,823
I was an inconvenience
for 50 years.

22
00:01:40,824 --> 00:01:42,343
50 years!

23
00:01:42,344 --> 00:01:45,104
Well, he's dead now, so...
You never liked him.

24
00:01:47,144 --> 00:01:50,784
God, I make better coffee
than this in the microwave.

25
00:01:54,464 --> 00:01:57,023
God, these glasses are mucky.

26
00:01:57,024 --> 00:02:00,023
I've got a pen pal.
Did William tell you?

27
00:02:00,024 --> 00:02:01,823
No.

28
00:02:01,824 --> 00:02:03,743
This fella I was at school with.

29
00:02:03,744 --> 00:02:06,623
Well, except that
he was a lad then, obviously.

30
00:02:06,624 --> 00:02:09,504
I showed Gran how to put her details
on Facebook.

31
00:02:10,904 --> 00:02:12,463
Well, so who is he?

32
00:02:12,464 --> 00:02:14,743
Alan, he was called.

33
00:02:14,744 --> 00:02:16,623
He still is!

34
00:02:16,624 --> 00:02:19,543
Hang on, stop.
Start again. You...

35
00:02:19,544 --> 00:02:22,103
When Granddad was...
He can talk for himself!

36
00:02:22,104 --> 00:02:25,183
When I were at school,
there were this lass, this girl...

37
00:02:25,184 --> 00:02:27,423
Who he fancied. Whatever.
Keep going!

38
00:02:27,424 --> 00:02:29,623
Well, that's it, really.
No, it isn't.

39
00:02:29,624 --> 00:02:31,263
Put his name on Facebook,
right.

40
00:02:31,264 --> 00:02:34,343
Oh, aye! That's it.
And there she was. Celia Dawson.

41
00:02:34,344 --> 00:02:36,463
Nee Armitage.
Her and Doreen Wilkinson.

42
00:02:36,464 --> 00:02:38,783
Yeah, just two of 'em
out of t'whole year.

43
00:02:38,784 --> 00:02:40,742
You're joking?
So, we wrote to her.

44
00:02:40,743 --> 00:02:42,264
"We"?
Granddad were a bit nervous.

45
00:02:42,265 --> 00:02:45,183
What for?
Well, I were in two minds.

46
00:02:45,184 --> 00:02:47,383
So, you wrote to her, and...?

47
00:02:47,384 --> 00:02:48,823
And she wrote back.

48
00:02:48,824 --> 00:02:50,264
So, we kept it going!

49
00:02:52,104 --> 00:02:53,344
Oh, it's all nowt.

50
00:02:54,544 --> 00:02:56,143
It's all nowt.

51
00:02:56,144 --> 00:02:57,703
We're just pen pals.

52
00:02:57,704 --> 00:03:00,223
Except it's been a trip down
memory lane.

53
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:03,463
Well, sort of, given that...

54
00:03:03,464 --> 00:03:04,903
Given that...?

55
00:03:04,904 --> 00:03:08,103
Well, you see, he was in my
year but not in my form.

56
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:10,383
Gran was in the A stream.

57
00:03:10,384 --> 00:03:14,543
And if he's who I think he is, then
not everything he says adds up.

58
00:03:14,544 --> 00:03:18,463
You see, I think they lived up in the
wilds, somewhere up Stainland.

59
00:03:18,464 --> 00:03:20,423
She lived in t'next street.

60
00:03:20,424 --> 00:03:24,383
Only he talks
like he lived in the next street.

61
00:03:24,384 --> 00:03:26,224
And if he did, well...

62
00:03:27,744 --> 00:03:30,023
I'm beggared if I can place
him.

63
00:03:30,024 --> 00:03:32,543
Well, I were amazed when
she wrote back.

64
00:03:32,544 --> 00:03:34,024
I didn't think I were t'sort

65
00:03:34,025 --> 00:03:36,703
someone like her would
remember. Why?

66
00:03:36,704 --> 00:03:38,783
What sort's she?

67
00:03:38,784 --> 00:03:40,863
Glamorous.
Oh, aye?

68
00:03:40,864 --> 00:03:44,063
She always seemed... a bit better
spoken than the rest, and I...

69
00:03:44,064 --> 00:03:47,543
I were on t'shy side and
gormless.

70
00:03:47,544 --> 00:03:49,063
So, where is she now?

71
00:03:49,064 --> 00:03:53,383
Harrogate. She's got a little
flat at her daughter's house.

72
00:03:53,384 --> 00:03:56,503
Last time he saw her was in
1953. Really?!

73
00:03:56,504 --> 00:03:59,903
Yeah, her dad got a job down in
Sheffield and that were it - off
they went.

74
00:03:59,904 --> 00:04:03,423
He was heartbroken.
Did she know you had a...

75
00:04:03,424 --> 00:04:04,983
thing about her?

76
00:04:04,984 --> 00:04:07,063
Oh, she'd not look at me twice.

77
00:04:07,064 --> 00:04:09,943
I've told him. He wants to invite
himself over.

78
00:04:09,944 --> 00:04:12,743
Yeah! Why not? Say you're passing.

79
00:04:12,744 --> 00:04:17,264
Say... you're in Harrogate anyway
and would she like to meet up for a
cup of tea?

80
00:04:20,344 --> 00:04:23,223
Your Uncle Robbie's here,
Raff. Yes!

81
00:04:23,224 --> 00:04:24,983
Half an hour early.

82
00:04:24,984 --> 00:04:26,583
Want you back by five.

83
00:04:26,584 --> 00:04:27,824
No way!

84
00:04:32,464 --> 00:04:34,903
Told you this last time.
I made it clear.

85
00:04:34,904 --> 00:04:39,303
Mum, it doesn't finish while five.
How are we gonna get back here by
five?

86
00:04:39,304 --> 00:04:41,063
Hiya, Robbie.
Raff.

87
00:04:41,064 --> 00:04:42,463
I want him back by five.

88
00:04:42,464 --> 00:04:44,343
Right. No, not "right",

89
00:04:44,344 --> 00:04:46,224
like you're just saying it to
shut me up.

90
00:04:46,225 --> 00:04:48,943
"Right!", like you're heard
what I've said and it's sunk in.

91
00:04:48,944 --> 00:04:50,463
Right.

92
00:04:50,464 --> 00:04:52,303
He's got homework.
I've done it!

93
00:04:52,304 --> 00:04:53,304
When?!

94
00:04:54,584 --> 00:04:56,744
I'll ring yer.

95
00:04:59,824 --> 00:05:03,103
♪ ...Run for your lives... ♪

96
00:05:03,104 --> 00:05:04,224
Bastard.

97
00:05:08,144 --> 00:05:11,063
Why don't you ask him for a photo if
you can't picture him?

98
00:05:11,064 --> 00:05:14,383
She's got one. He sent one.
On the e-mail.

99
00:05:14,384 --> 00:05:17,383
Only I'm none the wiser, as folk
change so much, don't they?

100
00:05:17,384 --> 00:05:18,984
Especially men.

101
00:05:22,664 --> 00:05:25,064
That's John's car.

102
00:05:45,624 --> 00:05:47,023
Dad's here.

103
00:05:47,024 --> 00:05:49,743
Hi. Hello.

104
00:05:49,744 --> 00:05:51,944
I let myself in.
So I see.

105
00:05:53,304 --> 00:05:54,744
Hi, Will.

106
00:05:55,944 --> 00:05:57,104
I'm off upstairs.

107
00:05:58,584 --> 00:06:00,064
Didn't know you had a key.

108
00:06:00,065 --> 00:06:01,824
Do you want it back?

109
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:04,303
Either way.

110
00:06:04,304 --> 00:06:06,663
How's your mother?

111
00:06:06,664 --> 00:06:08,464
Fine. Good.

112
00:06:10,184 --> 00:06:11,944
Why are you here?

113
00:06:14,024 --> 00:06:16,344
Do you want to give us a
few minutes? Sure.

114
00:06:45,024 --> 00:06:49,583
Um... I'm tempted to say it's a
long story, but it isn't really.

115
00:06:49,584 --> 00:06:51,703
In fact, it's pretty
straightforward.

116
00:06:51,704 --> 00:06:53,423
Turns out...

117
00:06:53,424 --> 00:06:55,064
Judith's a bit of an alcoholic.

118
00:06:56,864 --> 00:06:59,743
I knew she had a significant
relationship with the stuff,

119
00:06:59,744 --> 00:07:01,424
I knew she liked a drink, but,
um,

120
00:07:01,425 --> 00:07:03,423
yeah...

121
00:07:03,424 --> 00:07:05,864
didn't realise the extent of it.

122
00:07:08,664 --> 00:07:11,463
Has she tried to get help?
Oh, yeah. More than once.

123
00:07:11,464 --> 00:07:14,783
I don't think it's something
that'll sort itself out overnight.

124
00:07:14,784 --> 00:07:16,903
Well, if ever, in fact, so...

125
00:07:16,904 --> 00:07:19,064
Yeah.

126
00:07:21,664 --> 00:07:23,784
So, how does this involve me?

127
00:07:25,304 --> 00:07:26,984
I've made a terrible mistake,
Caroline.

128
00:07:30,224 --> 00:07:31,903
Oh, I see.

129
00:07:31,904 --> 00:07:33,704
You want to come back?

130
00:07:35,384 --> 00:07:36,944
What do you think?

131
00:07:41,104 --> 00:07:43,983
I don't know.
I was dazzled.

132
00:07:43,984 --> 00:07:46,063
It's pathetic, isn't it?

133
00:07:46,064 --> 00:07:49,743
Even more so when you see
what a ridiculous
empty-headed mess she...

134
00:07:49,744 --> 00:07:52,024
Sorry. You don't want to hear
this.

135
00:07:53,824 --> 00:07:57,183
That's so selfish!

136
00:07:57,184 --> 00:07:59,423
Out of necessity, I suppose.

137
00:07:59,424 --> 00:08:01,663
You can't imagine it until
you've...

138
00:08:01,664 --> 00:08:03,143
Sorry.

139
00:08:03,144 --> 00:08:05,143
I suppose I never have.

140
00:08:05,144 --> 00:08:06,943
Seen it before, up close.

141
00:08:06,944 --> 00:08:08,944
The real McCoy.

142
00:08:11,384 --> 00:08:14,263
And it's only now I realise...

143
00:08:14,264 --> 00:08:16,264
how much of a fool I've made
of myself.

144
00:08:17,744 --> 00:08:21,463
And to have thrown away all this here
with you and the boys.

145
00:08:21,464 --> 00:08:22,864
And for what?

146
00:08:24,784 --> 00:08:26,183
It's appalling.

147
00:08:26,184 --> 00:08:27,904
It's abysmal, it's unthinkable.

148
00:08:56,904 --> 00:09:00,944
"I am planning a trip
up to Skipton next week.

149
00:09:05,064 --> 00:09:07,504
"Possibly Monday."

150
00:09:13,024 --> 00:09:17,583
"If you fancied meeting up for
a coffee,

151
00:09:17,584 --> 00:09:22,344

opportunity to...

152
00:09:26,824 --> 00:09:30,904
"Would you fancy meeting up
for a coffee?

153
00:09:32,544 --> 00:09:35,104
"...a cup of coffee?

154
00:09:36,344 --> 00:09:42,424
"I appreciate that you
probably have much more
interesting things to do...

have your week planned...

"...free...

158
00:10:01,024 --> 00:10:03,784
"...it would be very nice to
see you."

159
00:10:05,664 --> 00:10:07,584
"With very best wishes...

160
00:10:12,464 --> 00:10:15,384
"Best wishes, Alan."

161
00:10:35,344 --> 00:10:36,743
Hello?

162
00:10:36,744 --> 00:10:38,583
Alan, it's Robbie.

163
00:10:38,584 --> 00:10:41,223
Lad's come off his bike.
Is Gillian there?

164
00:10:41,224 --> 00:10:44,303
Er, no, no. She's...
Ambulance is here.

165
00:10:44,304 --> 00:10:46,583
They're taking him to
t'Princess Royal.

166
00:10:46,584 --> 00:10:48,464
Shall I see you there, then, or
what?

167
00:10:48,465 --> 00:10:51,023
Yeah, but what's he done?

168
00:10:51,024 --> 00:10:52,743
I dunno. He's...

169
00:10:52,744 --> 00:10:55,183
Well, he's conscious now,
anyway, so...

170
00:10:55,184 --> 00:10:57,824
Yeah, well, see you there. Ta.

171
00:11:01,424 --> 00:11:03,104
Gillian!

172
00:11:25,664 --> 00:11:28,543
Where is he?
He's in wi' t'doctor.

173
00:11:28,544 --> 00:11:30,582
Well, congratulations, Robbie.
Finally got what you wanted.

174
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:32,544
What are you talking about?
Oh, you know.

175
00:11:32,545 --> 00:11:35,103
This is what I wanted, him flat on
his back in an ambulance? You love

176
00:11:35,104 --> 00:11:37,743
that every Saturday I go through
hell worrying about him getting
hurt.

177
00:11:37,744 --> 00:11:39,904
I know you've got a screw loose,
Gillian, so I won't push it,

178
00:11:39,905 --> 00:11:43,263
but you'd better apologise for that.
Oh, yeah, that's happening!
Come on, calm down.

179
00:11:43,264 --> 00:11:45,144
I go biking with Raff because
he loves it.

180
00:11:45,145 --> 00:11:49,303
I love it. Eddie loved it. It's in
us blood. So, don't you come
and accuse me...

181
00:11:49,304 --> 00:11:51,624
Yeah, and if you hadn't raked
up all that bloody trouble

182
00:11:51,625 --> 00:11:55,063
when Eddie died, nobody'd have
reason to think you took
any satisfaction! No, don't.

183
00:11:55,064 --> 00:11:57,663
You're lucky I let you have 'owt to
do with him. Yeah?

184
00:11:57,664 --> 00:12:00,464
Well, you're lucky that you've not
had him taken off yer.

185
00:12:01,584 --> 00:12:03,264
Raff, lad!

186
00:12:04,744 --> 00:12:07,023
Oh, God, you had me worried!

187
00:12:07,024 --> 00:12:08,703
Oh, they fussed, Mother.

188
00:12:08,704 --> 00:12:12,063
I said, I don't need an ambulance,
I don't need an X-ray,

189
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:15,104
I'm made like rubber, but...
nobody were listening.

190
00:12:26,504 --> 00:12:27,744
Hello.

191
00:12:30,704 --> 00:12:31,984
John's gone.

192
00:12:34,184 --> 00:12:37,064
He's gone to fetch some of his
things. He's moving back in.

193
00:12:38,544 --> 00:12:41,504
Right. I've told him he'll have to
sleep in another room.

194
00:12:43,544 --> 00:12:46,624
It seems very easy for him
after all that he's done.

195
00:12:49,824 --> 00:12:51,583
It turns out she's an alcoholic.

196
00:12:51,584 --> 00:12:53,663
And he's just discovered this?

197
00:12:53,664 --> 00:12:56,023
After goodness knows how
many months?

198
00:12:56,024 --> 00:12:58,904
He knew she had a problem -
he didn't know the extent of it.

199
00:13:00,984 --> 00:13:04,064
He wants to meet me in
Skipton for a cup of coffee.

200
00:13:06,104 --> 00:13:07,304
Oh, your, um...

201
00:13:07,305 --> 00:13:10,144
Alan. Are you going?

202
00:13:11,904 --> 00:13:13,464
No.

203
00:13:15,344 --> 00:13:16,944
D'you think I'm making a
mistake?

204
00:13:18,704 --> 00:13:20,944
Doesn't matter what I think,
love.

205
00:13:34,344 --> 00:13:36,304
"Dear Alan.

206
00:13:41,464 --> 00:13:42,824
"Sadly...

207
00:13:47,024 --> 00:13:49,464
"Unfortunately...

208
00:13:59,384 --> 00:14:02,944
"I would be delighted to meet
you in Skipton on Monday."

209
00:14:35,184 --> 00:14:36,744
I'll put the kettle on.

210
00:14:40,904 --> 00:14:42,824
Just you pause there a
second, lad.

211
00:14:42,825 --> 00:14:47,463
If you jack this in -
properly, once and for all...

212
00:14:47,464 --> 00:14:49,904
I'll buy you a car
when you pass your test.

213
00:14:50,944 --> 00:14:52,223
Why?

214
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:55,823
Because that's how much
your mum can't stand it.

215
00:14:55,824 --> 00:14:58,383
She lost your dad.

216
00:14:58,384 --> 00:14:59,864
She doesn't want to lose you.

217
00:15:26,624 --> 00:15:28,544
Hi, Lawrence.
Give us a hand.

218
00:15:33,024 --> 00:15:34,224
Yeah, right!

219
00:16:51,664 --> 00:16:55,824
Um, do you... really want me
to sleep in the spare room?

220
00:16:57,264 --> 00:16:59,744
Just so I know
where to put my stuff. Um...

221
00:17:03,024 --> 00:17:06,744
I've got the Independent
Schools Inspectorate coming
in this week and...

222
00:17:09,224 --> 00:17:11,224
Just don't push it, all right?

223
00:17:59,664 --> 00:18:03,343
Kicking off to number
36 in the pop charts...

224
00:18:03,344 --> 00:18:06,024
What did you say to Raffy?
Hm?

225
00:18:08,024 --> 00:18:10,584
About buying him a car?
Oh...

226
00:18:12,504 --> 00:18:14,504
He does his own thing, Dad.

227
00:18:16,024 --> 00:18:19,104
If he wants to be friends with
Robbie, fine. I hate him.

228
00:18:20,344 --> 00:18:21,984
Dozy pillock.

229
00:18:23,384 --> 00:18:24,424
But...

230
00:18:25,464 --> 00:18:27,024
he's Eddie's brother.

231
00:18:28,264 --> 00:18:30,463
And Raff has to make up his
own mind about folk.

232
00:18:30,464 --> 00:18:32,463
I asked him not to tell you.

233
00:18:32,464 --> 00:18:36,503
Yeah, I appreciate that.
I appreciate you interfering.

234
00:18:36,504 --> 00:18:38,743
I love it when you interfere!

235
00:18:38,744 --> 00:18:41,064
But I'm not stopping him
doing stuff he likes doing.

236
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:46,944
He has to outgrow
things... naturally, and then he
won't resent people.

237
00:18:48,104 --> 00:18:49,144
Me.

238
00:18:52,064 --> 00:18:54,063
I'm meeting her.

239
00:18:54,064 --> 00:18:56,464
In Skipton on Monday.
Are you?

240
00:18:57,544 --> 00:18:59,383
Mm.

241
00:18:59,384 --> 00:19:00,623
Are you?! Mm.

242
00:19:00,624 --> 00:19:03,103
Well, if she turns up.
Why wouldn't she?

243
00:19:03,104 --> 00:19:05,343
Well, I dunno.

244
00:19:05,344 --> 00:19:07,704
I don't know that I'll have
enough to say to her,

245
00:19:07,705 --> 00:19:09,944
enough to keep a
conversation going.

246
00:19:11,864 --> 00:19:15,184
Perhaps I should find an
excuse. What for?

247
00:19:18,144 --> 00:19:20,383
I did ask her out once.

248
00:19:20,384 --> 00:19:22,743
Did you?

249
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:24,743
So?

250
00:19:24,744 --> 00:19:26,623
Oh, she never turned up.

251
00:19:26,624 --> 00:19:30,103
I stood there nearly two
hours, then after,

252
00:19:30,104 --> 00:19:33,823
I found out that's when
she'd gone to Sheffield.

253
00:19:33,824 --> 00:19:35,423
That same day.
You're kidding?

254
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:37,664
She's probably forgotten.

255
00:19:38,824 --> 00:19:41,183
That were a rotten trick.

256
00:19:41,184 --> 00:19:45,103
Well, it might not have been.
She might just have forgotten.

257
00:19:45,104 --> 00:19:48,623
If they were flitting, she'd have had
a lot on her mind, and, er...

258
00:19:48,624 --> 00:19:53,343
well, you know, we were only kids,
teenagers, so...

259
00:19:53,344 --> 00:19:56,303
Aw, Dad.

260
00:19:56,304 --> 00:19:58,583
Well, you don't have to go.

261
00:19:58,584 --> 00:20:00,744
Oh, I can't pull out now.

262
00:20:02,904 --> 00:20:06,224
And it were 60 years ago.
So what?

263
00:20:07,944 --> 00:20:10,384
I thought the sun shone
out of her.

264
00:20:12,624 --> 00:20:15,903
I can still feel that feeling I felt
when I looked at her.

265
00:20:15,904 --> 00:20:18,344
You've been married to me mother for
50 years since then.

266
00:20:19,304 --> 00:20:21,384
Oh, I know. I...

267
00:20:23,344 --> 00:20:24,664
I loved your mum.

268
00:20:26,664 --> 00:20:27,784
We were...

269
00:20:29,264 --> 00:20:30,424
pals.

270
00:20:32,464 --> 00:20:33,704
But Celia...

271
00:20:35,024 --> 00:20:36,384
It were more like...

272
00:20:37,784 --> 00:20:38,864
I dunno.

273
00:20:40,544 --> 00:20:44,264
Now Heaven walks on Earth.

274
00:20:46,344 --> 00:20:48,463
Is that a line from something?

275
00:20:48,464 --> 00:20:49,823
Probably. Oh.

276
00:20:49,824 --> 00:20:51,183
It will be.

277
00:20:51,184 --> 00:20:52,584
Shakespeare.

278
00:20:54,264 --> 00:20:56,544

- Morning.
- Good morning.

288
00:23:07,464 --> 00:23:08,944
Oh, sod it.

289
00:23:34,464 --> 00:23:35,983
There's your tea.
Thank you.

290
00:23:35,984 --> 00:23:39,144
And your change.
Oh, thank you very much.

291
00:24:29,224 --> 00:24:30,304
Alan?

292
00:24:33,944 --> 00:24:35,263
Celia.

293
00:24:35,264 --> 00:24:36,543
How are you?

294
00:24:36,544 --> 00:24:39,183
Oh, I'm... not so bad.

295
00:24:39,184 --> 00:24:40,863
Er... how are you?

296
00:24:40,864 --> 00:24:42,583
Oh, I'm all right.
Good.

297
00:24:42,584 --> 00:24:44,543
Good, good.

298
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:46,463
Oh, that's, er...

299
00:24:46,464 --> 00:24:48,543
Oh, I know who you are now.

300
00:24:48,544 --> 00:24:49,743
Sorry?

301
00:24:49,744 --> 00:24:52,663
Penny dropped as soon as I
saw you.

302
00:24:52,664 --> 00:24:55,463
You didn't know who I was?

303
00:24:55,464 --> 00:24:57,384
I didn't for long enough.
I sent you a photograph.

304
00:24:57,385 --> 00:25:01,263
Even with the photograph, I
was thinking you were that
other Alan, up at Stainland.

305
00:25:01,264 --> 00:25:04,463
Alan... Robertshaw?
Robertshaw!

306
00:25:04,464 --> 00:25:07,223
With spindly legs?
SHE LAUGHS

307
00:25:07,224 --> 00:25:10,943
Had he? Spaghetti Legs, my dad
called him.

308
00:25:10,944 --> 00:25:12,503
I don't remember his legs.

309
00:25:12,504 --> 00:25:15,543
Now, you lived in the next
street.

310
00:25:15,544 --> 00:25:18,704
I didn't realise there was
a... confusion.

311
00:25:20,104 --> 00:25:23,503
Are you disappointed?
No!

312
00:25:23,504 --> 00:25:25,903
How was your journey?

313
00:25:25,904 --> 00:25:28,023
Oh, it was fine, thank you.

314
00:25:28,024 --> 00:25:29,384
Only, um...

315
00:25:30,784 --> 00:25:32,943
What can I get you?

316
00:25:32,944 --> 00:25:35,503
Oh, she'll come over.
Only what?

317
00:25:35,504 --> 00:25:39,183
Well, I didn't, um...
get a-a ticket for the...

318
00:25:39,184 --> 00:25:40,823
Oh!
...for the car park.

319
00:25:40,824 --> 00:25:43,264
I didn't have the right change.
Do you want to go back?

320
00:25:43,265 --> 00:25:45,663
No, let me get you something first.

321
00:25:45,664 --> 00:25:48,063
Then I'll...

322
00:25:48,064 --> 00:25:49,623
Isn't it odd?

323
00:25:49,624 --> 00:25:52,943
Things you remember and
things you don't.

324
00:25:52,944 --> 00:25:55,143
Yes, always.

325
00:25:55,144 --> 00:25:58,463
Didn't you ask me out once?

326
00:25:58,464 --> 00:26:00,023
Did I?

327
00:26:00,024 --> 00:26:01,823
Mm, you probably don't
remember.

328
00:26:01,824 --> 00:26:03,383
Um...

329
00:26:03,384 --> 00:26:04,624
You did.

330
00:26:06,224 --> 00:26:08,623
Oh!
Yeah, that's right.

331
00:26:08,624 --> 00:26:10,503
Then I couldn't come.

332
00:26:10,504 --> 00:26:13,663
Because it was when
we were moving to Sheffield.

333
00:26:13,664 --> 00:26:15,383
Oh. Yeah.

334
00:26:15,384 --> 00:26:17,143
And we went a day early.

335
00:26:17,144 --> 00:26:19,063
I can't remember why now.

336
00:26:19,064 --> 00:26:20,824
It'll be my mother not being
organised.

337
00:26:22,184 --> 00:26:23,744
You go and get your ticket.

338
00:26:25,384 --> 00:26:27,183
Can I have a latte, please?

339
00:26:27,184 --> 00:26:29,303
D'you know, it's ringing a bell.

340
00:26:29,304 --> 00:26:31,423
Now you've said it.
Good.

341
00:26:31,424 --> 00:26:34,103
But you got my note.

342
00:26:34,104 --> 00:26:35,863
Did I?

343
00:26:35,864 --> 00:26:37,463
Yeah. What note?

344
00:26:37,464 --> 00:26:40,743
I sent you a note to say I
couldn't come.

345
00:26:40,744 --> 00:26:42,743
I gave it to Eileen Pickford
to give to you.

346
00:26:42,744 --> 00:26:45,743
Eileen? Yeah.

347
00:26:45,744 --> 00:26:49,543
To say I was sorry
I was letting you down, but...

348
00:26:49,544 --> 00:26:53,504
this was my new address in Sheffield
so you could write to me.

349
00:26:55,384 --> 00:26:56,623
Did you?!

350
00:26:56,624 --> 00:26:59,143
Oh, don't tell me you didn't
get it?

351
00:26:59,144 --> 00:27:01,143
You didn't? No!

352
00:27:01,144 --> 00:27:02,423
Oh!

353
00:27:02,424 --> 00:27:05,303
Well, it's a good job you'd
forgotten.

354
00:27:05,304 --> 00:27:09,544
Cos otherwise you'd have
spent the last 60 years
thinking I'd stood you up!

355
00:27:13,304 --> 00:27:15,063
You go and get your ticket.

356
00:27:15,064 --> 00:27:16,824
OK.

357
00:27:49,024 --> 00:27:50,463
Kate...

358
00:27:50,464 --> 00:27:51,543
Kate.

359
00:27:51,544 --> 00:27:53,464
Have you got five minutes?

360
00:28:04,704 --> 00:28:06,024
Just take a...

361
00:28:08,504 --> 00:28:09,784
Sit down.

362
00:28:11,384 --> 00:28:12,744
Very formal.

363
00:28:16,424 --> 00:28:19,264
John turned up on Saturday.
He...

364
00:28:20,464 --> 00:28:22,744
He wants to move back in, so...

365
00:28:24,264 --> 00:28:26,703
so I said yes.

366
00:28:26,704 --> 00:28:27,944
For the boys' sake.

367
00:28:27,945 --> 00:28:30,144
When you say move back in,
does that mean...?

368
00:28:31,344 --> 00:28:34,943
I don't know what it means,
exactly.

369
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:36,103
Yet.

370
00:28:36,104 --> 00:28:37,464
I'm amazed.

371
00:28:38,904 --> 00:28:40,224
After everything he's done.

372
00:28:42,104 --> 00:28:43,584
After everything you've said.

373
00:28:43,585 --> 00:28:46,343
It's mainly for the boys.

374
00:28:46,344 --> 00:28:48,224
God knows we see enough of
it here,

375
00:28:48,225 --> 00:28:50,743
parents who put their children
anywhere except first.

376
00:28:50,744 --> 00:28:53,703
They think they do until it
comes to their own
convenience and...

377
00:28:53,704 --> 00:28:55,543
ha...

378
00:28:55,544 --> 00:28:56,903
Happiness.

379
00:28:56,904 --> 00:29:00,023
I don't wanna be like that.
He doesn't put them first.

380
00:29:00,024 --> 00:29:02,823
Yes, well, perhaps all the more
reason why I should.

381
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:05,223
Look...

382
00:29:05,224 --> 00:29:06,624
I'm very...

383
00:29:09,384 --> 00:29:11,503
fond...

384
00:29:11,504 --> 00:29:12,943
of you.

385
00:29:12,944 --> 00:29:14,984
You know that. I just...

386
00:29:17,504 --> 00:29:20,023
don't think I can do this any
more.

387
00:29:20,024 --> 00:29:22,824
Obviously we can be friends.

388
00:29:23,984 --> 00:29:25,344
But, um...

389
00:29:27,504 --> 00:29:29,423
the other thing, it...

390
00:29:29,424 --> 00:29:30,704
it's not me.

391
00:29:32,464 --> 00:29:35,263
I mean, it's not not me,
I'm just not, you know...

392
00:29:35,264 --> 00:29:37,663
ready...

393
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:39,184
to go there.

394
00:29:48,504 --> 00:29:49,823
I've got 9F.

395
00:29:49,824 --> 00:29:51,263
Bad luck!

396
00:29:51,264 --> 00:29:52,424
Sorry.

397
00:29:53,744 --> 00:29:55,064
I am sorry.

398
00:30:39,704 --> 00:30:41,864
Oh, God.

399
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:48,304
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Keep calm.

400
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:09,823
Can I have a packet of 20,
please?

401
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:11,704
How old are you?

402
00:31:12,944 --> 00:31:15,104
You know how old I am. You asked me
that t'other night.

403
00:31:17,224 --> 00:31:18,824
Right, can I see your ID?

404
00:31:31,344 --> 00:31:32,864
Thank you.

405
00:31:40,384 --> 00:31:43,823
You going up to t'White Horse again
Friday night? This Friday?

406
00:31:43,824 --> 00:31:45,423
No. Probably not.

407
00:31:45,424 --> 00:31:47,023
Why not?
Stuff to do.

408
00:31:47,024 --> 00:31:48,384
Have you 'eck.

409
00:31:49,384 --> 00:31:51,903
That's a shame, cos I thought
I might buy you a few beers.

410
00:31:51,904 --> 00:31:53,904
Again.

411
00:31:56,264 --> 00:31:58,344
That's £6.30.

412
00:32:01,864 --> 00:32:04,023
Oh...

413
00:32:04,024 --> 00:32:06,223
I'll be there anyway.

414
00:32:06,224 --> 00:32:08,944
If you're feeling... lonely.

415
00:32:10,184 --> 00:32:11,664
Right.

416
00:32:13,704 --> 00:32:15,304
Mind how you go.

417
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:19,104
Ooh!

418
00:32:34,544 --> 00:32:36,943
Is that what you thought?

419
00:32:36,944 --> 00:32:40,223
Sorry?
That I'd stood you up.

420
00:32:40,224 --> 00:32:41,664
Well, um...
You must have done.

421
00:32:41,665 --> 00:32:43,823
Well, I suppose I might have.
You did!

422
00:32:43,824 --> 00:32:45,103
Y... Well...

423
00:32:45,104 --> 00:32:46,743
Oh, how embarrassing.

424
00:32:46,744 --> 00:32:50,143
How sad. No, look, it's water
under t'bridge.

425
00:32:50,144 --> 00:32:53,424
I think my car's...
I really hoped you'd write.

426
00:32:54,824 --> 00:32:56,103
Did you? Yes.

427
00:32:56,104 --> 00:32:58,023
I waited for a letter.

428
00:32:58,024 --> 00:33:01,943
Never occurred to me
she wouldn't give it to you.

429
00:33:01,944 --> 00:33:04,463
'Appen she were jealous.
'Appen she forgot.

430
00:33:04,464 --> 00:33:06,264
Well... And I probably just assumed

431
00:33:06,265 --> 00:33:08,743
you just didn't have time to bother
writing.

432
00:33:08,744 --> 00:33:12,103
No, no! No, Celia. I'd have written
if I'd got it.

433
00:33:12,104 --> 00:33:15,944
Well, that's the last time I'll
ask Eileen Pickford to do
anything for me.

434
00:33:17,024 --> 00:33:19,984
She's dead. Is she?
Well, that'll teach her.

435
00:33:21,544 --> 00:33:25,103
D'you know, it's all come back to me
just now, just seeing your face.

436
00:33:25,104 --> 00:33:26,344
I married her.

437
00:33:28,024 --> 00:33:29,024
Eileen.

438
00:33:30,144 --> 00:33:32,503
She were Gillian's mother.

439
00:33:32,504 --> 00:33:34,984
Oh, good Lord. Aye.

440
00:33:38,464 --> 00:33:40,544
Well, she was a nice lass.

441
00:33:47,104 --> 00:33:49,824
I think my car's been stolen.

442
00:33:51,024 --> 00:33:52,344
What?

443
00:33:53,624 --> 00:33:55,864
Yeah, it's a blue Vauxhall
Astra.

444
00:33:57,664 --> 00:33:58,904
Sure, yeah.

445
00:34:00,184 --> 00:34:04,263
I can't say mine was a happy
marriage, cos it wasn't.

446
00:34:04,264 --> 00:34:06,184
I don't say that to everyone.

447
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:11,184
He wasn't the most faithful of
husbands, shall we say?

448
00:34:12,384 --> 00:34:13,783
Not just once, either.

449
00:34:13,784 --> 00:34:16,944
There was a whole string of them,
a whole stream of them.

450
00:34:18,584 --> 00:34:21,704
What's the collective noun for women
who aren't very fussy?

451
00:34:23,424 --> 00:34:25,943
Sorry, that too much
information?

452
00:34:25,944 --> 00:34:27,024
No.

453
00:34:28,304 --> 00:34:32,823
See, Caroline says it takes two
people to make a marriage go wrong.

454
00:34:32,824 --> 00:34:34,663
I don't believe that.

455
00:34:34,664 --> 00:34:37,343
She probably gets sick of me
going on about it.

456
00:34:37,344 --> 00:34:39,503
Well, she does.

457
00:34:39,504 --> 00:34:41,263
She says he's dead,
get over it.

458
00:34:41,264 --> 00:34:44,943
Well, not in so many words,
but that's what it amounts to.

459
00:34:44,944 --> 00:34:46,064
I'm sorry.

460
00:34:47,104 --> 00:34:49,103
Tell me about Eileen.

461
00:34:49,104 --> 00:34:51,543
Oh, we were very happy.

462
00:34:51,544 --> 00:34:54,104
Happy enough. Very... steady.

463
00:34:55,544 --> 00:34:57,464
Then she developed Alzheimer's.

464
00:34:59,184 --> 00:35:01,104
She didn't know me at t'finish.

465
00:35:03,904 --> 00:35:06,384
Fancy her not giving you my
letter.

466
00:35:08,184 --> 00:35:09,904
She must have liked you.

467
00:35:11,664 --> 00:35:15,463
So, I've processed your
information, Mr Buttershaw,
concerning your vehicle.

468
00:35:15,464 --> 00:35:17,384
How are you fixed for getting
home?

469
00:35:18,744 --> 00:35:21,343
Oh... Oh, I...

470
00:35:21,344 --> 00:35:22,903
In broad daylight?

471
00:35:22,904 --> 00:35:24,583
In Skipton?

472
00:35:24,584 --> 00:35:26,183
You're joking.

473
00:35:26,184 --> 00:35:30,663
So, I were, er, wondering if you
could come and pick me up?

474
00:35:30,664 --> 00:35:32,104
Not straightaway necessarily.

475
00:35:32,105 --> 00:35:33,503
Well, yeah... Thank you.

476
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:35,703
I don't know why
you won't let me drive you.

477
00:35:35,704 --> 00:35:37,904
You been to the police?
Yeah, well, it's a long way,

478
00:35:37,905 --> 00:35:40,663
and then you'd only have to drive
back to Harrogate.

479
00:35:40,664 --> 00:35:42,462
Er, yes, course we've been
t'police.

480
00:35:42,463 --> 00:35:44,422
It's only 40 miles or so,
isn't it?

481
00:35:44,423 --> 00:35:46,704
And have you got your pills
with you? Yes. Yes, yes.

482
00:35:46,705 --> 00:35:49,223
Um, and have you some
cash on you?

483
00:35:49,224 --> 00:35:50,743
Er, yes, I'm OK there.

484
00:35:50,744 --> 00:35:52,184
So, you're basically all right?

485
00:35:52,185 --> 00:35:54,503
Well, it were a bit of a shock.
And, er...

486
00:35:54,504 --> 00:35:56,943
they're not optimistic
about getting it back.

487
00:35:56,944 --> 00:35:59,183
Not all in one piece, anyway!

488
00:35:59,184 --> 00:36:00,543
Right.

489
00:36:00,544 --> 00:36:02,824
Well, I'll set off as soon as I
can after four, OK?

490
00:36:02,825 --> 00:36:04,303
OK.

491
00:36:04,304 --> 00:36:06,023
Dad...

492
00:36:06,024 --> 00:36:08,143
Dad, I'm gonna have to go.
Oh, OK.

493
00:36:08,144 --> 00:36:09,824
Ta-ta, love.
Right, keep in touch.

494
00:36:09,825 --> 00:36:11,544
Yeah, ta-ta.

495
00:36:13,344 --> 00:36:16,383
Well, she doesn't get off till,
er... four,

496
00:36:16,384 --> 00:36:19,023
otherwise she'd be straight
over.

497
00:36:19,024 --> 00:36:21,944
I'm not a bad driver,
if that's what you're thinking.

498
00:36:23,024 --> 00:36:28,064
We could pop down to Elland,
we could... look up a few
of our old haunts.

499
00:36:30,064 --> 00:36:32,943
Gillian were heartbroken
when her Eddie died.

500
00:36:32,944 --> 00:36:34,383
All over t'place.

501
00:36:34,384 --> 00:36:36,063
A farm to run.

502
00:36:36,064 --> 00:36:41,023
Never enough money. That's why she
works at t'supermarket.

503
00:36:41,024 --> 00:36:44,263
That's why I moved in -
she was struggling.

504
00:36:44,264 --> 00:36:45,823
I've still got my little house.

505
00:36:45,824 --> 00:36:48,103
Oh, have you? Mm.

506
00:36:48,104 --> 00:36:50,944
Up Barkisland. A lovely view.

507
00:36:52,024 --> 00:36:55,823
I rent it out. Which suits me.
I... I didn't like it on me own.

508
00:36:55,824 --> 00:36:58,023
Oh, I'm used to it.

509
00:36:58,024 --> 00:37:02,263
I've felt like I've been on me
own for the past 40 years.

510
00:37:02,264 --> 00:37:05,103
I'm sorry you've been so
unhappy.

511
00:37:05,104 --> 00:37:08,223
It isn't your fault.

512
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:10,503
Well, it's not what you
deserve.

513
00:37:10,504 --> 00:37:13,623
My memory of you is smiling.

514
00:37:13,624 --> 00:37:16,223
Lovely big smile.

515
00:37:16,224 --> 00:37:17,863
You were radiant.

516
00:37:17,864 --> 00:37:19,583
Oh!

517
00:37:19,584 --> 00:37:22,903
It's a long time since anyone's
called me that!

518
00:37:22,904 --> 00:37:25,224
You still are.

519
00:37:30,544 --> 00:37:32,183
That's... It is!

520
00:37:32,184 --> 00:37:33,663
That's... that's my car!

521
00:37:33,664 --> 00:37:35,463
You're joking?!
I'm not!

522
00:37:35,464 --> 00:37:38,023
I'm not! That's my
registration plate!

523
00:37:38,024 --> 00:37:39,743
Right...

524
00:37:39,744 --> 00:37:42,463
What are you doing? You get on the
phone to the police

525
00:37:42,464 --> 00:37:45,783
and I'll put me foot down.
Well, w-what shall I ring?

526
00:37:45,784 --> 00:37:47,463
999?
Yes, if you like.

527
00:37:47,464 --> 00:37:48,624
That's emergency.

528
00:37:48,625 --> 00:37:50,263
Well, this is an emergency.

529
00:37:50,264 --> 00:37:51,263
Oh, shut up!

530
00:37:51,264 --> 00:37:53,943
What?
No, not you. Oh, God!

531
00:37:53,944 --> 00:37:56,743
Where's reverse when you bloody well
need it?

532
00:37:56,744 --> 00:37:59,184
Oh...

533
00:38:06,264 --> 00:38:08,184
Are you all right?
Yeah, I'm fine.

534
00:38:08,185 --> 00:38:11,943
Oh, h-h-hello. Yes, er, police,
please.

535
00:38:11,944 --> 00:38:14,263
I just have a heart condition.

536
00:38:14,264 --> 00:38:17,663
Buttershaw, Alan.
Have you?

537
00:38:17,664 --> 00:38:20,183
Far Slack Farm, Ripponden.

538
00:38:20,184 --> 00:38:24,263
West Yorkshire. HX5 7LD.

539
00:38:24,264 --> 00:38:26,064
I'm supposed to avoid
excitement.

540
00:38:27,504 --> 00:38:31,103
Er, yeah, my car's just been
stolen, I've just reported it.

541
00:38:31,104 --> 00:38:35,663
But now we've just spotted it and now
we're just following it.

542
00:38:35,664 --> 00:38:37,224
At speed.

543
00:38:38,664 --> 00:38:40,263
We're... Where are we?

544
00:38:40,264 --> 00:38:43,103
We're on the B437,
heading back to Skipton.

545
00:38:43,104 --> 00:38:47,743
We're on the B437,
heading back to Skipton.

546
00:38:47,744 --> 00:38:51,104
Er, it's a blue Vauxhall Astra.

547
00:38:52,344 --> 00:38:54,903
Yes, yes, we're right behind
'em.

548
00:38:54,904 --> 00:39:00,024
What's this road? Well, it's
wiggly, anyway. It's by t'canal.

549
00:39:01,184 --> 00:39:03,703
Now we're going over a little
bridge.

550
00:39:03,704 --> 00:39:05,024
Oh.

551
00:39:12,184 --> 00:39:15,824
Hang onto your hat.
I am doing!

552
00:39:23,024 --> 00:39:24,384
Oh, heck!

553
00:39:25,544 --> 00:39:26,784
Oh...

554
00:39:30,624 --> 00:39:32,104
Careful!

555
00:39:33,824 --> 00:39:34,744
Oh!

556
00:39:37,544 --> 00:39:40,543
Not-not-not sure where we
are now.

557
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:41,744
Yeah, Albert Street.

558
00:39:41,745 --> 00:39:45,743
Well, w... In fact, we've just left
Albert Street. We're now in...

559
00:39:45,744 --> 00:39:47,544
Well, I dunno, summat else.

560
00:39:50,824 --> 00:39:52,743
Oh, my...
...God!

561
00:39:52,744 --> 00:39:54,664
Oh! Oh.

562
00:39:58,264 --> 00:39:59,703
W-What?

563
00:39:59,704 --> 00:40:01,863
Are we all right?
Yeah, are you all right?

564
00:40:01,864 --> 00:40:04,383
Yes. Oh, God.

565
00:40:04,384 --> 00:40:07,383
I'm so sorry. I...

566
00:40:07,384 --> 00:40:09,384
Oh, my God!

567
00:40:10,384 --> 00:40:11,863
Oh!

568
00:40:11,864 --> 00:40:14,143
I'm so sorry. Oh.

569
00:40:14,144 --> 00:40:15,664
No, I'm sorry. You've...

570
00:40:19,544 --> 00:40:21,224
Yeah, a silver A-class.

571
00:40:23,384 --> 00:40:24,383
Yeah...

572
00:40:24,384 --> 00:40:26,463
It was 20 years ago
first time it happened.

573
00:40:26,464 --> 00:40:28,663
I had to take early retirement.

574
00:40:28,664 --> 00:40:31,983
Then I had a funny do
ten years after that.

575
00:40:31,984 --> 00:40:35,823
On holiday. I should be dead, really!

576
00:40:35,824 --> 00:40:37,303
Good heavens.

577
00:40:37,304 --> 00:40:39,584
Still, we've had an adventure!

578
00:40:40,984 --> 00:40:43,343
I wonder what would have
happened...

579
00:40:43,344 --> 00:40:46,543
if Eileen had given you that
letter.

580
00:40:46,544 --> 00:40:49,823
We'll never know.
Well, we could speculate.

581
00:40:49,824 --> 00:40:51,823
I'd certainly have written.

582
00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:54,183
There's very little doubt about
that.

583
00:40:54,184 --> 00:40:56,103
What would you have put?

584
00:40:56,104 --> 00:41:01,064
Er, "Dear Celia," I'd have put,
"thank you for sending me your
address."

585
00:41:02,384 --> 00:41:03,983
And then what?

586
00:41:03,984 --> 00:41:05,903
I've no idea.

587
00:41:05,904 --> 00:41:09,983
We wouldn't have got very far,
then, would we?

588
00:41:09,984 --> 00:41:13,903
"I am sorry that you were unable to
turn up.

589
00:41:13,904 --> 00:41:17,303
"At least, however, I weren't left
standing there for two hours

590
00:41:17,304 --> 00:41:20,903
"on t'bridge outside t'church
in t'snow,

591
00:41:20,904 --> 00:41:23,943
"as I might have been
had you not written."

592
00:41:23,944 --> 00:41:25,663
You weren't?

593
00:41:25,664 --> 00:41:29,303
Well, not the snow bit, obviously,
it were July, but, er...

594
00:41:29,304 --> 00:41:31,383
I thought you said
you couldn't remember it.

595
00:41:31,384 --> 00:41:32,864
Yeah, well...

596
00:41:34,224 --> 00:41:35,224
I lied.

597
00:41:36,664 --> 00:41:38,824
I remember it like it were
yesterday.

598
00:41:40,184 --> 00:41:42,224
I were gutted.

599
00:41:43,344 --> 00:41:44,824
Oh, Alan.

600
00:41:46,984 --> 00:41:51,263
And there was me in Sheffield
thinking you didn't want
to write to me.

601
00:41:51,264 --> 00:41:55,103
Ah, but you didn't feel t'same way
about me as I felt about you.

602
00:41:55,104 --> 00:41:56,823
How do you know I didn't?

603
00:41:56,824 --> 00:42:00,703
Cor...! I'd been waiting for you
to ask me out for months.

604
00:42:00,704 --> 00:42:02,144
Years.

605
00:42:03,944 --> 00:42:07,823
Two hours ago, you thought I was
someone with spindly legs

606
00:42:07,824 --> 00:42:09,183
from up Stainland.

607
00:42:09,184 --> 00:42:12,023
I knew damn well who you
were the first time you wrote.

608
00:42:12,024 --> 00:42:14,423
I was pretending.

609
00:42:14,424 --> 00:42:16,663
Pretending to myself.

610
00:42:16,664 --> 00:42:18,543
Why?!
Because...

611
00:42:18,544 --> 00:42:21,103
I did like you, a lot.

612
00:42:21,104 --> 00:42:24,543
But I was never sure
how you really felt about me,

613
00:42:24,544 --> 00:42:26,304
not when you didn't write,
and...

614
00:42:27,744 --> 00:42:32,183
Oh, well, I can say it now because
it was 200 years ago and...

615
00:42:32,184 --> 00:42:34,104
because I'm shameless and...

616
00:42:36,104 --> 00:42:38,944
if I don't say it now,
I never will.

617
00:42:43,744 --> 00:42:45,464
I was in love with you.

618
00:42:50,544 --> 00:42:54,384
Right! Statements.
Who wants to go first?

619
00:42:55,424 --> 00:42:56,944
Mrs Buttershaw?

620
00:42:59,264 --> 00:43:00,504
We're not married.

621
00:43:20,024 --> 00:43:22,823
Got your text.
Yeah, I got yours.

622
00:43:22,824 --> 00:43:25,463
You're not jacking it in.
It's like I told you...

623
00:43:25,464 --> 00:43:26,584
Get in.

624
00:43:27,664 --> 00:43:29,384
You've gotta get straight back
on.

625
00:43:29,385 --> 00:43:32,103
That's what your dad would've said.
That's what your dad would've done.

626
00:43:32,104 --> 00:43:34,903
It upsets me mum too much. You can't
live your life not doing stuff

627
00:43:34,904 --> 00:43:38,103
just because your...
But it shook me up as well.
You're just saying that.

628
00:43:38,104 --> 00:43:40,744
This is about Gillian not wanting
you to have 'owt to do wi' me.

629
00:43:42,224 --> 00:43:43,344
No, it isn't.

630
00:43:44,744 --> 00:43:47,024
I'm gonna tell you summat
now, Raff, about your mother,

631
00:43:47,025 --> 00:43:50,103
about why she don't like you and me
bothering wi' each other.

632
00:43:50,104 --> 00:43:51,504
When our Eddie...

633
00:43:52,544 --> 00:43:54,183
When your dad died,

634
00:43:54,184 --> 00:43:55,744
you know what happened?

635
00:43:57,264 --> 00:43:58,824
Yeah. Ish.

636
00:43:59,864 --> 00:44:02,943
Wasn't an accident.
This is my personal theory.

637
00:44:02,944 --> 00:44:05,263
You know what happened,
right? Yeah.

638
00:44:05,264 --> 00:44:07,544
Death by misadventure. Yeah.
Bollocks.

639
00:44:08,624 --> 00:44:09,624
She killed him.

640
00:44:39,744 --> 00:44:42,143
Make yourself some tea, love.

641
00:44:42,144 --> 00:44:43,984
There's plenty of stuff in
t'fridge.

642
00:44:43,985 --> 00:44:45,823
I've got to go to...

643
00:44:45,824 --> 00:44:47,264
Skipton.

644
00:44:48,344 --> 00:44:50,864
Grandad's car's been stolen.

645
00:44:52,104 --> 00:44:55,544
Tell me about when me dad died.
What, now?

646
00:44:58,464 --> 00:45:01,023
Well... you know.
I... I've told you.

647
00:45:01,024 --> 00:45:02,343
Not everything.

648
00:45:02,344 --> 00:45:05,383
Robbie turned up outside the
school gates this aft'.

649
00:45:05,384 --> 00:45:07,184
Robbie?

650
00:45:08,704 --> 00:45:12,064
He said summat... weird.
Robbie's a mad bastard.

651
00:45:13,824 --> 00:45:15,024
D'you know what he thinks?

652
00:45:15,025 --> 00:45:17,823
Yeah, course I know.
He tried to have me arrested.

653
00:45:17,824 --> 00:45:20,424
Like I hadn't enough to cope
with at the time.

654
00:45:21,464 --> 00:45:25,383
Look, if you wanna
talk about this now, fine.

655
00:45:25,384 --> 00:45:27,984
But you're gonna have to
come with me.

656
00:45:33,344 --> 00:45:35,824
Ooh, it's hopeless. You can never
get hold of her at school.

657
00:45:35,825 --> 00:45:38,023
She's always got it switched
off.

658
00:45:38,024 --> 00:45:41,623
I've left a message anyway.
Right.

659
00:45:41,624 --> 00:45:44,304
And if I get desperate,
I can always ring John.

660
00:45:46,304 --> 00:45:47,863
Well...

661
00:45:47,864 --> 00:45:49,663
Who'd have thought it?

662
00:45:49,664 --> 00:45:51,544
Us here today, like this.

663
00:45:52,624 --> 00:45:55,503
Were you really...

664
00:45:55,504 --> 00:45:56,823
in love with me?

665
00:45:56,824 --> 00:45:59,824
What can I get you?
Ooh. Um...

666
00:46:02,544 --> 00:46:04,103
Er...

667
00:46:04,104 --> 00:46:05,583
Oh.

668
00:46:05,584 --> 00:46:08,623
What do you suppose
a crappuccino is, Alan?

669
00:46:08,624 --> 00:46:10,823
Isn't that an F?

670
00:46:10,824 --> 00:46:13,583
Is it? Where?
On the board.

671
00:46:13,584 --> 00:46:18,023
Is it?
It's frappuccino. Coffee with ice.

672
00:46:18,024 --> 00:46:21,823
They've always to muck everything
about these days, haven't they?

673
00:46:21,824 --> 00:46:25,263
Still, if you're not taking risks,
you're not living.

674
00:46:25,264 --> 00:46:27,423
That's what our William says,

675
00:46:27,424 --> 00:46:30,543
and he lives in his bedroom,
so what does he know?

676
00:46:30,544 --> 00:46:33,583
Oh, go on. I'll have one.

677
00:46:33,584 --> 00:46:36,223
Well, following that impeccable
logic, I'll have one as well.

678
00:46:36,224 --> 00:46:38,184
Thank you.

679
00:46:40,224 --> 00:46:43,183
I'd forgotten you were a comedian.
I'd forgotten you were one!

680
00:46:43,184 --> 00:46:46,983
You knew damn well
that didn't say "crappuccino"!

681
00:46:46,984 --> 00:46:50,383
Well, people bother with you more if
they think you're senile.

682
00:46:50,384 --> 00:46:52,703
I mean, look at that policeman.

683
00:46:52,704 --> 00:46:56,944
Well, either that or they run a
mile, which can be equally
entertaining.

684
00:46:57,984 --> 00:47:00,823
Were you really in love with me?

685
00:47:00,824 --> 00:47:01,983
Mm.

686
00:47:01,984 --> 00:47:03,904
I used to think about you...

687
00:47:05,024 --> 00:47:06,984
when I was miserable with
Kenneth.

688
00:47:08,184 --> 00:47:10,144
I used to wonder what you
were up to...

689
00:47:11,264 --> 00:47:12,584
and who you were with...

690
00:47:14,384 --> 00:47:18,104
and how different
things might have been if I'd
married a lad like you.

691
00:47:22,144 --> 00:47:25,543
Did you think about me?
When you were with Eileen?

692
00:47:25,544 --> 00:47:26,504
Now and again.

693
00:47:28,824 --> 00:47:32,624
See, I don't think I ever stopped
thinking about you.

694
00:47:34,384 --> 00:47:35,504
Oh...

695
00:47:36,824 --> 00:47:38,824
We missed a trick, didn't we?

696
00:47:40,104 --> 00:47:43,744
I can't believe Eileen
didn't give me that letter.

697
00:47:45,304 --> 00:47:47,463
Well, we can't change it.

698
00:47:47,464 --> 00:47:51,103
It's... it's such a big thing
not to have done.

699
00:47:51,104 --> 00:47:52,784
She must have known.

700
00:47:54,984 --> 00:47:58,423
Well, you've got Gillian and
Raffy,

701
00:47:58,424 --> 00:48:00,583
and I've got my lot.

702
00:48:00,584 --> 00:48:03,023
And I don't regret that,
do you?

703
00:48:03,024 --> 00:48:07,743
Whatever else might have happened.
No. No! No. I-I...

704
00:48:07,744 --> 00:48:10,103
Course not.

705
00:48:10,104 --> 00:48:12,103
He says it wasn't an accident.

706
00:48:12,104 --> 00:48:13,744
He says me dad wouldn't have been
that stupid.

707
00:48:13,745 --> 00:48:14,823
Look...

708
00:48:14,824 --> 00:48:17,023
He took risks with his biking,
right enough,

709
00:48:17,024 --> 00:48:19,103
but calculated risks,
Robbie said.

710
00:48:19,104 --> 00:48:20,584
He were big on safety on
t'farm.

711
00:48:20,585 --> 00:48:22,103
Yeah, yeah, he was,

712
00:48:22,104 --> 00:48:24,384
when he wasn't off his head
drunk.

713
00:48:26,464 --> 00:48:28,663
Look... He said you argued...

714
00:48:28,664 --> 00:48:30,903
all the time. Yeah, like thousands of
others.

715
00:48:30,904 --> 00:48:32,742
Well, he said how, days
before he died,

716
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:34,822
you argued and told him
you'd like to see him dead.

717
00:48:34,823 --> 00:48:36,464
Did he?
Well, I said you loved him

718
00:48:36,465 --> 00:48:39,383
and he had to shut his mouth.
Right. Well, that's... Good for you.

719
00:48:39,384 --> 00:48:43,543
Then he said how most of what he
deals with is stuff like this.
Domestics.

720
00:48:43,544 --> 00:48:45,902
What you don't realise... He said
that every copper knows

721
00:48:45,903 --> 00:48:48,224
people don't kill people they
couldn't give a toss about.

722
00:48:48,225 --> 00:48:50,823
What you don't realise, Raff,
about Robbie is...

723
00:48:50,824 --> 00:48:52,104
when Eddie...

724
00:48:54,464 --> 00:48:56,264
when your dad died...

725
00:48:57,664 --> 00:48:59,184
Jesus!

726
00:49:18,504 --> 00:49:20,463
It warped him.

727
00:49:20,464 --> 00:49:22,463
Robbie.

728
00:49:22,464 --> 00:49:25,104
He couldn't accept it. He couldn't
come to terms with it.

729
00:49:26,304 --> 00:49:28,303
He couldn't accept...

730
00:49:28,304 --> 00:49:29,823
it just happened.

731
00:49:29,824 --> 00:49:32,224
He had to blame someone.

732
00:49:33,824 --> 00:49:35,064
So...

733
00:49:36,104 --> 00:49:37,424
obvious choice.

734
00:49:39,104 --> 00:49:40,584
Me.

735
00:49:47,624 --> 00:49:49,384
He said one day he'd prove it.

736
00:49:52,064 --> 00:49:53,703
He won't, will he?

737
00:49:53,704 --> 00:49:55,184
No, love.

738
00:49:56,384 --> 00:49:57,384
No.

739
00:50:35,384 --> 00:50:36,784
Is that you, Ma?

740
00:50:42,984 --> 00:50:44,943
Opening game, with serve...

741
00:50:44,944 --> 00:50:46,383
Hard at it, are we?

742
00:50:46,384 --> 00:50:48,543
I was gonna cook supper,
but you might have to.

743
00:50:48,544 --> 00:50:50,663
Right.

744
00:50:50,664 --> 00:50:52,663
I got a B in my science test
today, Ma,

745
00:50:52,664 --> 00:50:54,783
and then I scored a try.
Good, well done.

746
00:50:54,784 --> 00:50:56,824
He thinks if he lies like that
he'll be able to see up

747
00:50:56,825 --> 00:50:58,463
the girlies' skirts on the telly,

748
00:50:58,464 --> 00:51:01,663
We've been discussing your mother.

749
00:51:01,664 --> 00:51:03,263
Have you?
"Age cannot wither her,

750
00:51:03,264 --> 00:51:06,383
"nor custom stale her infinite
variety." Apparently.

751
00:51:06,384 --> 00:51:08,543
Ignore him. He's drunk.
Really?

752
00:51:08,544 --> 00:51:10,824
Mature love, Antony and
Cleopatra, all that claptrap.

753
00:51:10,825 --> 00:51:13,543
You didn't tell me she had a fella.
She hasn't, it's just some old...

754
00:51:13,544 --> 00:51:16,143
someone she writes to on the
e-mail.

755
00:51:16,144 --> 00:51:18,863
Right, well, I'm off to Skipton
to pick her up. What?

756
00:51:18,864 --> 00:51:20,983
She's been trying to get hold
of you. Oh!

757
00:51:20,984 --> 00:51:24,663
She went to meet this Alan in Skipton
and then she pranged her car.

758
00:51:24,664 --> 00:51:25,824
Is she all right?

759
00:51:25,825 --> 00:51:29,343
Yeah, yeah, but the car's damaged, so
she needs picking up, so...

760
00:51:29,344 --> 00:51:32,103
I'll go. I'll go.

761
00:51:32,104 --> 00:51:33,464
I'll go!

762
00:51:40,864 --> 00:51:42,144
So...

763
00:51:43,304 --> 00:51:45,903
if I had written

764
00:51:45,904 --> 00:51:49,023
and if we had kept in touch...

765
00:51:49,024 --> 00:51:51,583
Going back to speculating.

766
00:51:51,584 --> 00:51:53,544
Oh, well...

767
00:51:54,624 --> 00:51:56,544
Maybe you'd have popped
down to visit me.

768
00:51:56,545 --> 00:51:58,543
More than likely.

769
00:51:58,544 --> 00:52:00,103
Then we might have gone
dancing.

770
00:52:00,104 --> 00:52:02,863
I imagine so!

771
00:52:02,864 --> 00:52:04,943
And then...

772
00:52:04,944 --> 00:52:06,703
Then...

773
00:52:06,704 --> 00:52:08,264
well...

774
00:52:09,384 --> 00:52:10,584
we might have...

775
00:52:10,585 --> 00:52:11,823
started...

776
00:52:11,824 --> 00:52:12,944
Courting?

777
00:52:14,024 --> 00:52:15,304
Yeah.

778
00:52:16,464 --> 00:52:18,623
Except by then, I'd have met
Kenneth.

779
00:52:18,624 --> 00:52:19,903
Would you?

780
00:52:19,904 --> 00:52:23,504
Him with his university
education and his prospects.

781
00:52:25,144 --> 00:52:26,424
Would that have been it, then?

782
00:52:27,544 --> 00:52:29,143
I don't know.

783
00:52:29,144 --> 00:52:33,543
You see, I think that's what I was
dazzled by - his prospects.

784
00:52:33,544 --> 00:52:35,543
I wouldn't be now.

785
00:52:35,544 --> 00:52:41,303
Now I know there are much more
important qualities a man can have,
but... then...

786
00:52:41,304 --> 00:52:42,663
I wanted...

787
00:52:42,664 --> 00:52:45,543
a nice house with a bit of garden

788
00:52:45,544 --> 00:52:46,864
and a car.

789
00:52:48,024 --> 00:52:49,824
Things my mum and dad had
never had.

790
00:52:51,264 --> 00:52:53,543
So, no.

791
00:52:53,544 --> 00:52:56,463
I would probably have made
the same mistakes.

792
00:52:56,464 --> 00:52:58,024
I had prospects.

793
00:52:59,744 --> 00:53:01,024
Oh, I know. I...

794
00:53:01,025 --> 00:53:04,383
Not t'same as Kenneth, perhaps.

795
00:53:04,384 --> 00:53:06,463
I wasn't comparing. I'm just...

796
00:53:06,464 --> 00:53:07,704
saying...

797
00:53:08,984 --> 00:53:11,823
And anyway, you weren't there.

798
00:53:11,824 --> 00:53:13,543
No.

799
00:53:13,544 --> 00:53:14,744
So...

800
00:53:16,264 --> 00:53:17,864
But I'm here now.

801
00:53:19,664 --> 00:53:21,824
You certainly are.

802
00:53:24,464 --> 00:53:27,903
You told Michael bloody
Dobson of all people?!

803
00:53:27,904 --> 00:53:30,463
That insidious little prick?
Are you cross?

804
00:53:30,464 --> 00:53:33,303
No, Kate, I'm delighted, I'm
thrilled, I'm over the bloody moon!

805
00:53:33,304 --> 00:53:35,824
Look, he's... I've gotta go,
I'm going, I'm driving.

806
00:53:48,384 --> 00:53:51,023
Hey! Oi!

807
00:53:51,024 --> 00:53:53,064
Sorry! Emergency.

808
00:53:54,704 --> 00:53:55,744
Jesus!

809
00:54:02,544 --> 00:54:03,663
Dad.

810
00:54:03,664 --> 00:54:05,464
Oh, Gillian!

811
00:54:07,104 --> 00:54:11,183
That was the most selfish,
mindless piece of driving

812
00:54:11,184 --> 00:54:12,904
I have ever witnessed.
I won't be a minute, love.

813
00:54:12,905 --> 00:54:14,943
Then you can have it.
You could see I'd got

814
00:54:14,944 --> 00:54:16,382
my reversing lights on, you could
see I'd already started manoeuvring.

815
00:54:16,383 --> 00:54:18,784
Yeah, well, if you keep your hair
on, I'll be less than 60 seconds.

816
00:54:18,785 --> 00:54:20,383
Idiot! Snotty bitch!

817
00:54:20,384 --> 00:54:22,463
Are you gonna let her
talk to you like that?

818
00:54:22,464 --> 00:54:24,023
Mum, you all right?

819
00:54:24,024 --> 00:54:25,543
Fine.

820
00:54:25,544 --> 00:54:27,983
- This must be Alan.
- Yes.

821
00:54:27,984 --> 00:54:30,383
How do you do? I'm
Caroline. How do you do?

822
00:54:30,384 --> 00:54:32,463
Thank you for staying with
her till I got here.

823
00:54:32,464 --> 00:54:36,103
We're gonna have to go - some
braindead lowlife trailer trash

824
00:54:36,104 --> 00:54:39,183
stole my parking space.
And... you've met my daughter.

825
00:54:39,184 --> 00:54:40,583
Sorry?

826
00:54:40,584 --> 00:54:42,704
Gillian, this is Celia...

827
00:54:44,504 --> 00:54:46,104
and Caroline.

828
00:54:47,264 --> 00:54:49,263
Hello, Celia.

829
00:54:49,264 --> 00:54:50,824
I've heard a lot about you.

830
00:54:52,664 --> 00:54:54,103
I've met Caroline.

831
00:54:54,104 --> 00:54:55,184
Right.

832
00:54:56,664 --> 00:54:58,184
Well...

833
00:54:59,264 --> 00:55:02,703
Now, then, we've got some
news for you.

834
00:55:02,704 --> 00:55:04,224
For both of you.

835
00:55:05,504 --> 00:55:07,024
We're getting married.

836
00:55:15,664 --> 00:55:18,183
What did you say to him?
That we kissed twice.

837
00:55:18,184 --> 00:55:19,503
I did this stupid thing.

838
00:55:19,504 --> 00:55:23,143
We were thinking about having a
little engagement do.

839
00:55:23,144 --> 00:55:25,584
There's something about you bending
over in a field

840
00:55:25,585 --> 00:55:28,383
that makes me almost unable to
contain meself. Piss off, Paul.

841
00:55:28,384 --> 00:55:31,183
Judith! I want you to come back.

842
00:55:31,184 --> 00:55:33,903
Hello! Are you the taxi!
Dad!

843
00:55:33,904 --> 00:55:38,023
We decided against an engagement
ring, so instead,

844
00:55:38,024 --> 00:55:40,263
we bought a car between us.

845
00:55:40,264 --> 00:55:43,784
It'd be like really good, if you
didn't mention this to Mum.

846
00:55:45,209 --> 00:56:18,667
