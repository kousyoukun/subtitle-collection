1
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:03,550
Guess the latest.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,150
We've decided we're
going to get married.

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,190
Right.

4
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:09,230
'You know my date with Gary?

5
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,910
'Wasn't me he was interested in.

6
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,550
'He thinks you had
a fling with his mother.

7
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:17,030
~ 'And that you're his dad.'
~ I didn't know there'd been a child.

8
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:19,430
~ Are you all right?
~ Judith's, erm, she's...

9
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:21,600
She's lost the baby.
It's been awful.

10
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,000
~ I got your text. ~ It's true.

11
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,830
They can't expect you to sell
your house in 28 days!

12
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,990
How else is he going to raise
that kind of money?

13
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,790
~ What's up? ~ Nothing.

14
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:35,430
Someone is going to have
to tell my mother at some point,

15
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:37,080
and, if none of you do, I will.

16
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:39,550
He'd like to meet you.

17
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,880
~ Gary? ~ Alan. Hello.

18
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:52,910
~ It's a bit of a shock. ~ Yes.

19
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,750
For both of us. For all of us.
I mean, Gillian, too.

20
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,160
Yes. Yes.

21
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,640
I didn't sleep much last night.

22
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,320
Yeah...

23
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,640
I didn't want to, erm...

24
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,320
I just...

25
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:19,870
Sorry. I realise I don't actually
have anything to say as such.

26
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,470
It's just, I was intrigued to meet
you. To see you, I suppose.

27
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,030
That's all.

28
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,270
She never told me she was...

29
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:30,000
Your mum, she never...
Did Gillian tell you?

30
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,550
Gillian's lovely, by the way.

31
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,870
Oh! Well.

32
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,040
So funny. So sweet.
So uncomplicated.

33
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,600
Her heart's in the right place.

34
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:56,510
So, what was he upset for?
I thought he never wanted it.

35
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,310
Well, no. He didn't.

36
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:02,630
I don't know, I've had all this
second-hand from Caroline.

37
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,750
Still, I suppose
if it was nearly full-term.

38
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,920
God knows what
she must have gone through.

39
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,470
Are they even together still?
I mean, were they ever,

40
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,590
really actually?
After a certain point?

41
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,870
God knows.
She's cleared off, anyway.

42
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:22,270
She's gone to live with her sister
in St Albans.

43
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:25,750
And he's been sleeping
in Caroline's spare room again.

44
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,630
~ Apparently. ~ Really? ~ Hm.

45
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:32,320
She's very good to him, Caroline,
given what a bugger he's been.

46
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,910
If it was me, he'd not darken
the doorstep ever again.

47
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,640
No. No. No.

48
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,150
How...

49
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,150
Can I ask how you met?

50
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:52,790
Erm... Well, I married Eileen,
Gillian's mum in 1957.

51
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:56,550
But the woman
I really wanted to marry,

52
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,630
the woman I was in love with,

53
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,720
she'd stood me up.
Except she hadn't.

54
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05,350
She left me a message.

55
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,230
Only I never got it.

56
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,630
Celia.

57
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,240
That's right.

58
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:17,390
I was very fond of Eileen.
But, truth is,

59
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,870
I got engaged to her on the rebound.

60
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,070
I don't think we'd have
called it that then,

61
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,630
and I certainly wasn't aware that

62
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:27,360
that's what I was doing.
But... yeah.

63
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,560
Then I met your mum.

64
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,070
At Jessops Chemicals.
Up Huddersfield.

65
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:39,680
She was a secretary.
And she reminded me of Celia.

66
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:44,350
The second I saw her,
everything about her,

67
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,110
the way her eyes lit up
when she smiled.

68
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,230
Way she walked.

69
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:54,590
I felt that same feeling I felt
when I was with Celia. It was...

70
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,550
I don't know.

71
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,720
Like... the world lit up.

72
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:07,230
And we were weak, we were daft,
we were old enough to know better,

73
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,080
it shouldn't have happened.

74
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,320
But it did.

75
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,870
Then she left.

76
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,520
And I never saw her again.

77
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,040
Did you TRY to see her again?

78
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,000
No.

79
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,880
I suppose... if I HAD known...

80
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:36,550
.. I'd like to think that
I'd have done the right thing.

81
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:40,870
It would have been more complicated,
obviously.

82
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:43,390
No, she should have told me.

83
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,390
She should have told me at the time.

84
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,960
How ever difficult it might have
been for everybody.

85
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,830
So you're not coming to this...

86
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,830
"wedding" then?

87
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,790
She did ask me.

88
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,590
Only I said we were busy.

89
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,280
And aren't you?

90
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,390
I don't think she really
wanted me there.

91
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,870
I think she only invited me
cos she thought she should.

92
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,150
I think you're being
a bit sensitive.

93
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:19,630
If she didn't want you, she wouldn't
ask you, you know what she's like.

94
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,430
Who else is going?

95
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:25,950
William's coming up from Oxford,
a few people from school,

96
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,190
a couple of her pals from Oxford,

97
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,310
and I don't know
about Kate's family.

98
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:36,720
It's only small, it's all a bit last
minute, not everyone's available.

99
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,720
Our Muriel's in Corfu, sadly.

100
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:45,190
So... John's living at the house.

101
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:48,590
And Kate's on leave now,
so she's at home all day...

102
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,790
with John.

103
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,750
Well, yeah. Presumably.

104
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,030
Cos he's never at work, is he?

105
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,000
I don't know why they pay him.

106
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,030
Contractions are good.

107
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:07,190
They're painful, but
they're on your side.

108
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:10,270
Your contractions happen
when your uterus contracts,

109
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:14,000
and that's what dilates,
or opens, the cervix.

110
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,550
Now, dads.

111
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,750
During labour,

112
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,830
you may find it distressing to see
your partner in so much pain.

113
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,200
Is this your first, not your first?

114
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:33,670
It's... it's... it's not my first.
It's Kate's first.

115
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:37,790
So you'll know what I'm talking
about. It is distressing,

116
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:42,110
but you just being there, gently
encouraging her to keep going,

117
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,760
that is so important.

118
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:50,080
It's... it's not actually mine,
as such, I'm just...

119
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,480
Kate's my wife's girlfriend.

120
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,350
OK...

121
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,480
So, let's talk about pain relief.

122
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,070
We're back!

123
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,510
Dad!

124
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,230
Ooh, my feet.

125
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,430
~ Calamity, you're getting heavier by
the hour. ~ I'm making you some tea.

126
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,600
Well...

127
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,150
.. I think I've spent up, Alan!

128
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:49,550
You'd better not have.
Not if we're thinking about this

129
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,760
Australasian adventure.

130
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:56,430
~ Are we serious? ~ I am if you are.

131
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:59,710
Why are we whispering?
Is it a secret?

132
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,320
No...

133
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:05,110
So, have you been busy?

134
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:08,150
No. No. No.

135
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:12,390
Right, I'll pop all this lot
upstairs, then I can relax.

136
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,430
~ Can you manage? ~ Oh, yes.

137
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:17,750
Tea? Coffee? Jaeger bomb?

138
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,200
Tea, thanks, love.

139
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,310
Have you had a nice time?

140
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:27,390
Clothes shopping
with my mother-in-law.

141
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,430
Step-mother.

142
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:32,790
Yeah, yeah.

143
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,520
It was a bit of a laugh.

144
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:41,030
~ How did you get on? ~ Fine.

145
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:45,390
~ Yeah? ~ Like you said,
he seems like a very nice fella.

146
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,040
Yeah. Yeah.

147
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,790
~ He's odd. ~ What?

148
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:53,390
~ I felt like I knew him. ~ Yeah.

149
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,590
~ Yeah. ~ So did I.
~ From the moment I saw his face.

150
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:01,110
~ So, what did he say,
what did he want? ~ Nothing.

151
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:04,670
~ I didn't think he did. I think he
just... ~ Just wanted to talk, yeah.

152
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,150
I wish I could've stopped with
him longer, but...

153
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:11,670
Any road, he asked me
if we'd like to go have a meal.

154
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:14,150
Meet Felicity. His wife.

155
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,790
Oh, so he is married, then?

156
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:19,030
Yeah. They've two girls.

157
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:23,400
He meant all of us -
you, me, Raff, Ellie, Calamity.

158
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:27,310
Celia.
He said he'd like to meet Celia.

159
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,230
I said...

160
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,960
"Well, I haven't told her yet."

161
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,270
So...?

162
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,150
Oh, I don't know.

163
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,710
You have got to tell her. I had
Caroline on t'phone

164
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,590
a couple of days ago and
she said if we... If you don't tell
Celia, she will.

165
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:47,110
What the hell were you doing
telling Caroline for?

166
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:51,030
I told you! And, look,
she wasn't being nasty.

167
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:54,790
To be fair to her, it's cos
she knows how upset Celia was

168
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,950
when she found out about Kenneth.

169
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,790
Knowing she'd been...

170
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:03,790
cheated on. Lied to.
And isn't it best to be honest?

171
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:07,510
Really? And coming from you sooner
rather than later.

172
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:10,190
I told Caroline you wanted
to meet him first.

173
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,110
And then you'd tell her. Celia.

174
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,550
She was fine with that.

175
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,750
But now you have met him...

176
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,710
So...

177
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,110
OK.

178
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,270
~ So? ~ Yeah, I'll tell her.

179
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,950
~ When? ~ Soon.

180
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,320
Soon!

181
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,190
Well, why did you let him
go with you?

182
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:36,230
Because... I don't know!

183
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,830
He just tagged along and, of course,

184
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,590
I was daft enough to feel
sorry for him.

185
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:42,590
I should've said,
right in front of everyone,

186
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,870
"She's not your wife, she's your
ex-wife John, you're divorced."

187
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,630
~ Yes, you should've done.
~ "She's my wife's girlfriend."

188
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:51,270
"She's my wife. Very nearly.
And you're..." I don't know.

189
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,790
A friend of the family.

190
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,710
Well. No. He's more than that,
he's the father of...

191
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,160
Still...

192
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,830
.. we don't need to split hairs.

193
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,750
"I know you've had an upset.
But can I just be blunt?

194
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,030
"You really, really need
to move out, John.

195
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,870
"Before me and Caroline
get married".

196
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:09,630
Yes, well, good.
You should've said it.

197
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,950
He's got all that money
we've begged, borrowed,

198
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,910
and stolen to buy his half of the
house. What's the problem?

199
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:18,470
I don't think we've stolen
anything, have we?

200
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,720
Whatever.

201
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:23,960
What is the problem? Just say it.

202
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,390
Can't you?

203
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,000
Sure.

204
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,240
~ Yes! ~ Damn.

205
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,640
I'll deal with it later.

206
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,350
I WILL deal with it later.

207
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,960
They're... playing a game.

208
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,910
If I go into labour,
he comes nowhere near that hospital.

209
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,960
Course he won't!

210
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,190
What's the matter?

211
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,320
I don't know.

212
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,280
I don't know,
maybe I'm just frightened.

213
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,760
Don't be frightened.

214
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,790
I'm not that much younger
than Judith.

215
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,910
Judith's an alcoholic.

216
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,990
What if there's something
wrong with it?

217
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,030
There won't be. Why would there be?

218
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:36,080
And if there is, we'll deal with it.
But there won't be. So.

219
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,200
And you WILL get rid of him?

220
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,950
I will ask him...

221
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,760
to leave.

222
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,640
Oh, God. I ought to ring my mum.

223
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,110
Hello?

224
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,830
'Mum, hi. It's me. How are you?'

225
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:17,670
~ Very well, love.
~ 'Good. Good. Good, how's Alan?'

226
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,630
Alan? He's fine.

227
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,670
Caroline says, "How's Alan?"
He's fine, love.

228
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,510
'Good. So, er...'

229
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:30,430
Good. So I've got nothing fresh
that I can think of. Have you?

230
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,950
'No... I don't think so.'

231
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,910
~ Have we got anything fresh, Alan?
~ No. No. No

232
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,790
(He's not told her.)

233
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:40,070
'We thought we'd drive over'

234
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:43,470
on Friday,
the day before the wedding,

235
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:47,310
'then if there's anything
you want doing, I can help out.'

236
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,750
Right. Good. Thank you.

237
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,120
Is that Ellie?

238
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,830
~ Did you decide on your outfit?
~ Hello, love.

239
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,470
~ Where've you been?
~ Supermarket. Greenhough's.

240
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,710
~ Not answering your phone.
~ Oh, have ya been ringing?

241
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,150
~ Oggy said you had an argument
with Mr Epplewhite. ~ I did.

242
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,830
~ Which one's he?
~ Politics.

243
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:08,110
I told him he can shove his course
work up his arse,

244
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,950
and I've left,
and I've got a job at Greenhough's.

245
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,760
You can't do that!

246
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,080
Well, I just did.

247
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,750
You can't NOT do your A-levels.

248
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,390
What's happened?

249
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,350
Well, no, I can. Not do them.

250
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,750
And then I can earn some money.

251
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,390
Have you spoken... Have you talked
to your mum about it?

252
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,990
No way, she's enough on worrying
about me grandad.

253
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:30,510
~ Right, well, I think you need to.
~ It's none of her business.

254
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,910
No, Ellie, it is!
She's going to be very upset

255
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:35,470
if you're going to drop
out of doing your A-levels.

256
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,270
You can't work at Greenhough's.

257
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,870
~ That's just a job, it's not a
career. ~ You're a clever lass!

258
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,430
You don't want to just go
chucking it all down the drain.

259
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,590
No, listen, it's good!
It's full-time!

260
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,390
He said I can go on a fast-track,

261
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:51,390
he said I can be a store manager
in a couple of years

262
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,390
if I put the hours in and play my
cards right,

263
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,230
~ there's all sorts of opportunities.
~ Wow(!)

264
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,190
It's money, Raff.

265
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,310
It's not being
dependent on every-bloody-body.

266
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,510
It isn't like I've got that many
people to be dependent on now

267
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,150
with me Grandad being such a loony!

268
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,910
I still think you need to
ring your mother!

269
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:13,590
Hang on,
I can't hear what you're saying,

270
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:16,750
they're all just shouting
at each other at this end.

271
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,670
Can I speak to Gillian?

272
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,440
Erm...
Yeah, I think so, hang on. Gillian!

273
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,080
It's Caroline.

274
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,150
What's happened? What's going on...?

275
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,670
Hiya, Caz.

276
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,390
He hasn't told her.

277
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,870
No, no, no, not yet.

278
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,560
'He needs to tell her.'

279
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,430
I know. He will.

280
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,590
He needs to tell her soon.

281
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:44,990
Yes. I know, I agree with you,
I'm working on it.

282
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,750
I do like Kate, you know.

283
00:15:55,800 --> 00:16:00,240
I suppose if Caroline had to be that
way, she could've done a lot worse.

284
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,470
It's funny, isn't it? Babies.

285
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,950
They're always welcome
when they come.

286
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,710
Even when they're unexpected.

287
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,960
Like our little Calamity.

288
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,440
And now there's this other one.

289
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,590
I know there's something
bothering you.

290
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,280
I wish you'd let on what it is.

291
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:31,070
Is it Harry and that damned silly
mess he's got himself into?

292
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,120
Well, what, then?

293
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,960
I've had a bit of news.

294
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,480
What news?

295
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,840
I've been in two minds about
whether to tell you or not.

296
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:58,360
~ What news?
~ It's not, I'm not ill, I...

297
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:04,630
I suppose there's a lot about
each other we still don't know,

298
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,070
isn't there?

299
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,350
Is there?

300
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:11,070
Well, 60-odd years
not seeing someone,

301
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:14,320
there's bound to be one or two...

302
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,360
What? One or two what?

303
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:25,280
It turns out I've got
a skeleton in the cupboard.

304
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,200
What do you mean?

305
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:33,200
One I never even knew I had.

306
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,440
Well, not...

307
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,430
What? What is it?

308
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,230
Oh, I don't care what it is, Alan.

309
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,510
You can tell me anything.

310
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:49,030
Nothing's worth making yourself
ill over, just tell me.

311
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:51,880
Just say it, just spit it out.

312
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,590
You'll think I'm like Kenneth.

313
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:00,120
How could you ever be like Kenneth?

314
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,680
I've got a lad.

315
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,000
A son.

316
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,310
A boy I never knew I had.

317
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,080
Well, I call him "lad."
He's a man now.

318
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,270
You see...

319
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,040
I had a bit of a fling.

320
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,350
When?

321
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,720
Years ago.

322
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,880
Before you were married?

323
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,840
No.

324
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:39,950
So, I don't want to make excuses.
It happened. It shouldn't have.

325
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,960
But I didn't know
there'd been a child.

326
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,600
When?

327
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:54,470
Year our Gillian were born.
Only as I say, I've only just...

328
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,840
The year Gillian were born?

329
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:03,960
But you'd been married nine years
when Gillian... was born.

330
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,910
Who was she?

331
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,760
You wouldn't know her.

332
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,840
They lived up Siddal.

333
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,710
Mary.

334
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:23,120
She were called Mary. Mary Kershaw.

335
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:29,000
Came to work at Jessops.
She were the secretary.

336
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,830
She, um...

337
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,720
She had the look of you.

338
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,760
The year Gillian was born,
you were...?

339
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,910
Did Eileen know?

340
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,350
No. It's like I'd said to Gillian,
it stopped before it started.

341
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:58,070
~ It was never...
~ So what does Gillian know about it?

342
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:00,840
Her date. On Valentine's Day.

343
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,030
It weren't a date as such.

344
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,600
It were him.

345
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,150
How long did it go on?

346
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,910
It didn't.

347
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,910
Long enough to get her pregnant.

348
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,440
Only the once.

349
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:23,000
Then she left. I never saw her again.

350
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:26,920
I had no idea she were...

351
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,070
So, what does he want, this Gary?

352
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,830
Nothing. He just wanted to meet me.

353
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,520
And are you going to?

354
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,350
Well, the thing is...

355
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,990
I already have.

356
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:47,910
I met him this morning when
you and Gillian went shopping.

357
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:51,030
And he's a grand fella, Celia.

358
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:54,030
And he's very keen to meet you.
Genuinely.

359
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:57,510
He's the sort of person
who genuinely seems to be

360
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:01,230
~ interested in people. He...
~ So, hang on.

361
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:04,870
He just rang out of the blue,
this morning,

362
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:07,190
when Gillian and me
just happened to be out shopping?

363
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:12,230
No. No. No, he, we, it were...
It were arranged.

364
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,390
Gillian arranged it.

365
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:17,550
Oh, so you were just getting me
out of the way?

366
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,920
No!

367
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,790
Look...

368
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,190
~ It were delicate... ~ Where?

369
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,920
Where did you meet him?

370
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:28,590
~ In a cafe. ~ Right.

371
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,950
I understand you'd probably rather
I'd told you first...

372
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,630
I'd rather you didn't lie to me
about what you were doing.

373
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:38,870
But, obviously, I were worried
about how you'd react.

374
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:43,680
You see, this is what adultery does
to people, it turns them into liars.

375
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,870
Well, no wonder you couldn't
have little Calamity,

376
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:51,070
no wonder we had to trail
her round with us.

377
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,350
It's been difficult,
knowing the right thing to do

378
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,750
and the right order to do stuff in.

379
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:58,510
And of course Gillian's been upset.

380
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:03,110
But not above colluding
with you about deceiving me.

381
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:05,070
Nobody wanted to deceive you!

382
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:08,360
It was just about knowing when
and how to tell you.

383
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,070
Well...

384
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,560
You've told me now.

385
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,160
Have you seen Ellie?

386
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:28,950
Yeah, she were up at 6:15,
she was off to catch the 6:50 bus.

387
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,470
She's to be at Greenhough's
at half past.

388
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:35,710
She didn't discuss this wi' me
at all, nothing.

389
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:39,030
~ You need to be communicating
with each other more. ~ No shit!

390
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,550
I'm not being an unpaid nanny
if she's out earning money.

391
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:45,390
That is not the way the world works,
this isn't cloud cuckoo land.

392
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,430
Also, plus, Yvonne is slinging me

393
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:50,430
cash every week for her
housekeeping. Which...

394
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:54,230
I can't accept that. I'm not
accepting that if Ellie's working.

395
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:57,950
~ Did she even speak to her mother
last night? ~ No idea.

396
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,910
Do you just not talk to each other
at all? About anything?

397
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,190
Hello?!

398
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:05,510
~ Right, well, I'll have to bang on
about it at her, then! ~ Feel free!

399
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,310
I'll see her later. I'm on a shift!

400
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:11,000
After I've done every bloody thing
else for every bugger else!

401
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,760
What's up with Celia
and me grandad?

402
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,950
What IS up with Celia
and your grandad?

403
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,430
They're sat at breakfast table
not speaking to each other.

404
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,430
Has something happened?

405
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,590
~ They were up in t'night,
I heard 'em. ~ No, I don't think...

406
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:36,200
Is one of 'em ill?

407
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:40,310
No. No. Nothing like that.

408
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,400
Just...

409
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:48,200
It turns out I've got a brother.

410
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:52,870
A half brother...

411
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,710
that I didn't know about.

412
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:55,920
How?

413
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,320
You what?!

414
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,640
I would like you to meet him.

415
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,680
You see, I think you'd like him.

416
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,640
He'd like to meet you.

417
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:26,000
I can't imagine why.

418
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,270
He's very... I don't know.

419
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,870
Calm.

420
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:36,030
His manner. Kindly and...

421
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:39,710
unusual. I was nervous about going to
meet him. But, no,

422
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,830
he just seemed to be wanting
to make sense of it himself,

423
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:48,240
and apologising, and saying that he
knew it was a shock for all of us.

424
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:54,270
He were being very grown-up
about the whole thing, I suppose.

425
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:57,040
And you want me
to be grown-up about it, too?

426
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,080
Well?

427
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,830
Either we can move forward together,
or...

428
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,680
I don't know what
the alternative is.

429
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:14,480
Maybe I should go and stay
with Caroline for a few days.

430
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,680
Caroline knows, by the way.

431
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,550
Caroline? What the hell
does Caroline know about it?

432
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,390
Gillian wanted to talk to her

433
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:28,840
before she told me,
after she met him. Gary.

434
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:34,560
Anyway, she thought Caroline'd know
the best way forward.

435
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:40,150
So Kate'll know about it as well,
won't she?

436
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:44,880
~ I mean, does everybody know
except me? ~ No. No!

437
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:51,670
Well, of course I discussed it with
Kate, I'm allowed to,

438
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:54,880
she's my partner.
We tell each other things.

439
00:25:55,920 --> 00:26:00,230
You see, this is what
I used to hate about your dad.

440
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:03,390
Him mucking about
and everybody knowing.

441
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:08,550
Then you find out and you realise
they've been laughing at you
behind your back.

442
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,310
Or else feeling sorry for you.

443
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,390
All who?

444
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:15,430
'Oh... Everybody, anybody,'

445
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,750
I don't know. You lot.

446
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:20,640
Not in this instance,
nobody's like that.

447
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,560
I'm so shocked, Caroline.

448
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:28,280
I thought he was different.

449
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,920
I thought I knew him.

450
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:35,390
I thought he was better than that.

451
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:39,030
You know, when you haven't seen
someone for 60 years,

452
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:41,640
there will be things about them
you don't know.

453
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:45,150
I love you.

454
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,470
I know you do.

455
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:50,910
And I think he does,
I know he does, and you know,

456
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,510
'this isn't about you,
and I think you need to try

457
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:55,350
'and step back from it.'

458
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:59,550
He went and met him
without telling me.

459
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,030
'Yeah.'

460
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,190
Yeah...

461
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,550
Did you know that?

462
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,590
'Yeah. Yeah. I...'

463
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,910
Yeah.

464
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:10,750
~ Why didn't you tell me? ~ 'I was
going to! I told Gillian, I said'

465
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:13,280
"If you don't hurry up
and tell her, I will."

466
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:17,030
Are all men rotten?

467
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,600
No. No.

468
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:22,790
A lot of them are, but I don't
think Alan's one of them.

469
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:26,030
If I thought he was I'd have driven
straight over there two days ago and

470
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:29,630
ripped his pacemaker out
and shoved it...

471
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,320
where the sun doesn't shine.

472
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:35,790
He hasn't got a pacemaker.

473
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:39,070
'No, I know, I know. I just...'

474
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,310
I thought it sounded good.
But I would.

475
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:44,110
'If I thought for one second that he
was taking the mickey

476
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,590
'out of you, I'd deal with him.'

477
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:48,150
I don't think he is.
I think he's a good man.

478
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:51,470
I think he's made a mistake and
I bet he's doing his damnedest now

479
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:55,270
to make things right, because I
would imagine that he is terrified.

480
00:27:55,320 --> 00:28:00,030
~ 'Terrified of losing you.'
~ You're very wise.

481
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,950
'Hm...'

482
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,720
I wonder who I get that from?

483
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,870
Not me.

484
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:11,510
You're right to be upset.
He was unfaithful to his wife.

485
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:14,750
That's something that's going to
bring back a lot of unpleasant

486
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,990
memories for you,
but it was a long time ago.

487
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:19,670
'That's not an excuse,
but it really

488
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:22,480
'isn't a reflection
on you personally, is it?

489
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,200
'Can you see that?'

490
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:29,470
I know you're shocked, I know you're
upset, and come over here for

491
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:32,710
a few days on your own if you want
a bit of time to yourself but...

492
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:36,680
you don't really want to lose Alan,
Mum, do you?

493
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,880
Have I buggered everything up?

494
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,470
You've been a while.

495
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:17,200
I went for a little drive
onto the tops.

496
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,030
We were worried you
weren't coming back.

497
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,590
I rang Caroline.

498
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,070
Is she all right?

499
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:27,350
Mmm. Kate's sick of John
being around the house all day.

500
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:30,670
But Lawrence likes him being there,
so she's finding it difficult

501
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:35,000
to tell him to sling his hook.
But, no, nothing else fresh.

502
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:43,230
I really don't want to be
small-minded about this.

503
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:48,670
I'm not Kenneth, Celia.
It happened once.

504
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,310
I were ashamed of it, I regretted it,

505
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,520
and it never happened again.

506
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:55,920
OK.

507
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:59,400
I'd almost forgotten it'd happened.

508
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:06,040
Happen I blacked it out,
I don't know.

509
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,480
Right.

510
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,790
Are we friends?

511
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,560
Course we're friends.

512
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:21,590
I googled him.

513
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:24,350
~ Sorry? ~ Gary! I googled him.

514
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:27,990
You know I said it looked like
he'd done all right for himself?

515
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:31,110
Well, he has. He's owns Cafe Rapido.

516
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:34,990
Mobile coffee shops, mobile baristas.

517
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:37,950
Vans selling coffee,
and pastries, and cakes,

518
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,190
like at railways stations
and football matches,

519
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:43,790
and, well, you'll have
seen 'em around.

520
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:47,400
~ I've never been to a football match.
~ They're all over!

521
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:51,790
He started off with one van
when he were 18,

522
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:55,790
and now he has whole fleets of 'em,
up and down the country.

523
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:59,870
He's an entrepreneur,
he's a multi-millionaire.

524
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:05,550
~ Is he? ~ He supports all sorts of
charities and good causes.

525
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,830
He owns
Huddersfield Town Football club!

526
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,630
Do you want to have a look?

527
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:15,200
Let me see
if I can find it again for you.

528
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:33,510
You and me need to be having

529
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,560
a proper conversation
at some point, lady.

530
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:39,470
~ Gillian! ~ Cheryl.

531
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:42,070
~ How's yourself?
~ Yeah... I'm all right.

532
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:44,630
Bless. I've heard the news.

533
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:46,190
Which?

534
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,750
That you and Robbie's been
at it behind my back.

535
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,870
Anything you'd like to say to me?

536
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,350
I, er...

537
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,870
You don't know
what I'm talking about?

538
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:57,470
No, I'm sorry,
that's not going to wash.

539
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:59,830
It were Robbie
that telled me hisself.

540
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:02,950
Bit of a domestic about the kitchen.
Him not wanting to spend money,

541
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,030
and me saying, "Well, this is just a
breeding ground for bacteria,"

542
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,710
then one thing led to another
and it all came tumbling out.

543
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,710
So, what I'd like to suggest is,

544
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,830
next time you're making whoopee,
if you could just ask him

545
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,870
to wear one of these cos, obviously,

546
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:21,470
I personally don't want to be
picking up anything unpleasant.

547
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:25,190
Oh, as well, if you're so desperate
for sex that you need to borrow

548
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:28,160
other people's fellas,
let me give you this.

549
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:33,670
Yep, so...

550
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,790
there we go.

551
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:38,320
Have a nice day. Mind how you go.

552
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,630
Careful now, don't get too close,
or she'll have your kecks off.

553
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:47,270
I know, and with
a face like a bust shoe.

554
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:50,070
She must be releasing the right
sort of pheromones, eh?

555
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,760
Oh, I like your shoes!

556
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,710
So I said "Fine.

557
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:27,870
"You can shove your job where
monkeys shove their nuts."

558
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:31,310
~ I've had enough being talked to
like crap. ~ Well... what happened?

559
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,150
Nothing.

560
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,830
Just... him saying how I'm always
trouble.

561
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,750
Me! I know.

562
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,070
Always late.

563
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:42,310
Really? Twice in the last...

564
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:45,790
month.
Always mouthing off, apparently.

565
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:50,270
Only because I'm sticking up
for people, other people,

566
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:53,510
against him being
a fascist dictator.

567
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:57,990
I said, I told him,
"My father was a union man.

568
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:00,190
"I'm not apologising."

569
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:03,150
Then him just going on about
how I'm always...

570
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:08,270
Whatever, so I just said
"Fine. Fine. You know what?

571
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:11,910
"Fine. For me, this is win-win."

572
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,680
So you lost your job.

573
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:17,830
No, I... I resigned.

574
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,640
How is it win-win?

575
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:24,870
I get time off and I don't have to
listen to that jackass

576
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,670
telling me what to do any more.

577
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:28,440
Oh, you pillock.

578
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,830
Where's Celia?

579
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:37,990
Oh. She was here
before I nodded off.

580
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:40,350
Is the Lexus outside?

581
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,270
Yeah.

582
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,150
Celia?!

583
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:46,440
I'm just upstairs!

584
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:50,280
~ Did you tell her? ~ Yeah.

585
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:55,280
~ Yeah. And? ~ She's fine.

586
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,790
Fine how?

587
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:02,790
Obviously, it were a shock
to start with. But, I don't know,

588
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:05,920
Caroline seemed to talk some
sense into her.

589
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:11,240
Yeah, and,
come and have a look at this.

590
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:16,910
I googled him.
Do you realise who he is?

591
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:21,350
You'll not believe it.
He's a real mover and a shaker.

592
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:24,270
You'll not credit
what he's achieved.

593
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,720
~ Blimey. ~ Yeah.

594
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,870
God!

595
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,710
~ Huddersfield Town? ~ He owns it.

596
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:35,310
Maybe he'll give me a job,
cutting the Astroturf.

597
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:38,390
Well, ask him. I rang him,
we're all going to tea on Friday.

598
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:42,150
~ Tea? ~ Supper. Dinner. A meal.

599
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,040
Seven for seven-thirty.

600
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:49,390
~ I'll have to tell Raff. ~ Yeah, I...

601
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,390
Already told him.

602
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,110
He heard you get up in the night,

603
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:56,950
~ and he was worried you were ill,
so I... ~ How did he...?

604
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:01,310
Oh, he thought it was "well cool"
I think were the exact words.

605
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:04,350
The fact that you'd been unfaithful
to my mother appeared to go

606
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,550
right over his pretty little head.

607
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:09,950
But then again he's a bloke, so...

608
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,590
What you doing?

609
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:13,830
I'm going to Harrogate. Hello, love.

610
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:16,430
~ Celia. ~ I don't want to make a fuss.

611
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:20,110
I'm happy for you to go and have
dinner with this Gary.

612
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:23,150
I can see you're all excited about
it and I understand why,

613
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,910
he's obviously a very
successful young man,

614
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:28,710
but I personally would
find it difficult. So...

615
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:31,470
If it's all right with everyone
here, I'd rather be in Harrogate.

616
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:35,510
Celia, it's not because he's
successful, it's because he's,

617
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,430
well, he's flesh and blood.

618
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:40,270
Yes, well, whatever it is,
he'll understand...

619
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,710
He was particular in
wanting to meet you.

620
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:44,430
It's you he's interested in.

621
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,790
And that's fine. Like I say,
I don't want to be

622
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:50,830
small minded about it. But, equally,
you'll understand

623
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,750
if I don't want to be there.

624
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:56,910
And, anyway, it's the wedding
the next day and she might want me

625
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:00,470
over there Friday night in case
there's anything wants doing.

626
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:03,160
OK, I won't go.

627
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,990
No. You're going,
I'm not having that.

628
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:09,000
You're going.

629
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:26,270
I thought I might cook
this evening for everyone

630
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:29,120
as a sort of thank you.
I bought steak.

631
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,790
You're not a vegetarian, are you?

632
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:35,430
No. I can't do nuts,
but other than that...

633
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:36,920
I bought this.

634
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,120
Sweet, isn't it?

635
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,750
I always wanted a girl.

636
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,950
I mean, I love the boys, obviously,

637
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:51,790
I wouldn't swap them. But, secretly,
I always wanted a little girl, too.

638
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:55,080
But Caroline didn't want to have
any more after the boys came along.

639
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,830
I'm really sorry about
what's happened, John.

640
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,350
Yes.

641
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,760
I know you are.

642
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:09,120
You've both been very kind.

643
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,160
Do you want some tea?

644
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,790
Oh, yeah, Mum.

645
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:35,270
What's this about you
and a vibrator and some condoms?

646
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,710
I said not to say owt!

647
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:39,350
So actually you got sacked, in fact.

648
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,790
~ I resigned. ~ She resigned.

649
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:42,790
~ What happened? ~ Nothing.

650
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:45,950
~ Cheryl came in the shop. Apparently.
~ I wouldn't have told you about it

651
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,910
if I thought you were going to
be horrible!

652
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:50,550
And repeat it in front
of your grandad!

653
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:52,950
~ I'll go. ~ What happened?

654
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,510
I wouldn't have, Gillian.

655
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,070
What happened?

656
00:38:56,120 --> 00:39:00,510
There was an incident at work
involving Cheryl.

657
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:07,150
Who clearly has some form
of borderline personality disorder

658
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:11,150
and who got the wrong
end of the stick. Yet again!

659
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,990
So, what happened?

660
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,750
I can't turn it off.

661
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:27,280
~ Carry on! ~ Perhaps we should have
a chat, Gillian? In my office.

662
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,640
~ Are you all right?
~ Yeah, I'm fine.

663
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:37,110
So, he said it was a final warning,
and I resigned.

664
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:39,990
NO, hang on. Why would Cheryl
do something like that?

665
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:42,960
~ Because she's deranged. ~ And she's
thick. Not that she can help it.

666
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:47,110
I heard about what happened
and I just wanted to say sorry.

667
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:50,720
I should've er... I should've warned
you that she, er...

668
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,800
.. that she...

669
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,790
Anyway, she's moved out, she's gone.

670
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,150
Why?

671
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:01,870
Er...

672
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:04,110
Oh...

673
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:06,240
You've...

674
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,990
Don't you ever, EVER pull that face
at me again, young man.

675
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:15,870
~ Why? What has...? Oh.
~ I did tell you.

676
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:18,750
~ Yeah. ~ You told HIM? When?

677
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:21,830
We've been invited out for tea
to Gary's.

678
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,390
Gary? Oh...

679
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,190
So...

680
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:27,160
OK. Blimey.

681
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:31,430
~ So she's moved out? ~ Yup.

682
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:33,240
We need to be setting off.

683
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:39,400
~ Sorry. OK. Well, look I'll...
catch up with you later. ~ Yeah.

684
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,920
'So, they're going.'

685
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,470
He's fair smitten with him.

686
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:55,470
He said he felt like he knew him
when he met him.

687
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,430
Soon as he clapped eyes on him,

688
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:00,070
he said he felt like
he'd "always known him."

689
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:02,750
Which, I mean how can you?

690
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,590
It's Gillian I feel sorry for.

691
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:08,790
Losing her job and then Alan
all excited about this fella

692
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,950
being a multi-millionaire.

693
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,670
Obviously, it's complicated for...

694
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:16,990
She's obviously got very mixed
feelings about him herself,

695
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:20,030
but, oh, no, Alan's blind to it.

696
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:24,110
On the one hand, he's saying
he's ashamed he ever had this...

697
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:27,230
relationship, and, on the other,
he seems to think

698
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:30,280
this fella's the best thing
since sliced bread.

699
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:44,150
Talk about the pot
calling the kettle black.

700
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:46,430
~ Eh? ~ Oh, no... ~ Oh, yes!

701
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,110
All these years.

702
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:51,710
Listen, and I wasn't the other
woman. She was.

703
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:54,270
Me and Robbie, we just had
a bit of a blip, that's all,

704
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:58,230
cos of that loud-mouthed, alcoholic
bitch sticking her neb in.

705
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,430
Which?

706
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:02,910
~ Judith. ~ We're not going to parade
all this in front of Gary, are we?

707
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,910
What, all our dirty linen?!

708
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,390
Oh, hell, no.

709
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:09,430
We don't want him
thinking any of us have sex, do we?

710
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:11,230
Eh, Grandad?

711
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:21,750
~ Where the hell are we? ~ We're lost.

712
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:25,070
~ I think it looks dead creepy.
~ So do I.

713
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:29,190
~ God, this is dank. ~ I'm wondering
if that was a wrong turn.

714
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:33,190
That first one we took way back
when we came off main road.

715
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:34,720
Oh, now he says it!

716
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:38,670
Shit. What was that?

717
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:40,990
Oh, we're all right. Keep going.

718
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:43,870
The worst thing that can happen
is we'll end up in Slaithwaite.

719
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:47,230
~ It's like we're in The Rocky Horror
Picture Show. ~ Yeah.

720
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:49,670
Do you think Uncle Gary's
a transvestite, Mum?

721
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:52,390
From Transsexual Transylvania?

722
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:54,310
~ Hey, there's a light.
~ Eh? Where?

723
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:59,080
~ Over at the Frankenstein place. ~ No.
~ No, there really is a light, look.

724
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:04,190
Wow.

725
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:06,350
Look. Good lord.

726
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,470
Oh, my God.

727
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:10,000
Blimey.

728
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:20,030
I was 17, this was in summer 1983

729
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:23,110
and I had FIVE part-time jobs.

730
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:25,750
~ And one of them was in... ~ Five? Why?

731
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:28,750
~ How? ~ I don't know, I was saving up
to go to university.

732
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:33,150
~ He never went. ~ I didn't need to,
hadn't time, and one of them...
~ You didn't hear that.

733
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:34,750
Do you know Luigi's?

734
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:37,550
Cafe on George Square
in the middle of Halifax,

735
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:39,710
~ I used to wash up there.
~ Thank you. ~ Anyway,

736
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:42,670
there was this old Gaggia
machine in the stock room upstairs,

737
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:45,590
been there for years gathering dust,
it was defunct, it was ancient,

738
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:49,390
God knows why he never threw it out,
but I reckoned I could fix it up

739
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:51,430
and I offered him £5 for it,

740
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:53,310
and he laughed and said,

741
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:57,950
"Gary, you take it, I give
you £5 to take it away".

742
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:02,590
~ That's an Italian accent if you
were... ~ Yeah. ~ .. wondering.

743
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:06,870
So, but, at the same time,
my grandad, my mum's dad,

744
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:09,990
he retired, he was retiring,
he was a painter and decorator

745
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:12,430
and he had this old van he'd
used for years and years,

746
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:15,310
it was dropping to pieces
and I said, "Can I have it?"

747
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:20,470
And he said, "Gary lad, I'll give
you £10 to take it away". So...

748
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:25,190
I've got a coffee machine and a van.

749
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:27,310
What are you going to do?

750
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:31,790
~ You're going to put them together,
aren't you? ~ Inevitably. Obviously.

751
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:34,510
~ That was, in fact, my idea.
~ Well, she says this.

752
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:35,870
Because it's true.

753
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:38,070
So, where did you two meet?

754
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:40,990
Ah, well, there's another story.

755
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:44,910
You know Tyson's, the company
that makes security alarms

756
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:47,510
and security equipment
down in Sowerby Bridge?

757
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:49,350
Well...

758
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:54,630
Know what I mean?

759
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:58,750
Now... And this is a first edition?

760
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:02,270
No, not quite, no. God knows what
that would be worth, no.

761
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:06,750
This is the first edition in
America, with, look...

762
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:10,830
The publisher's misattribution on
the title page to Charlotte Bronte.

763
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:12,710
Isn't that, you know...

764
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:15,190
~ .. amazing? ~ Amazing.

765
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:22,430
I'm SO excited that we've met, Alan.

766
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:26,430
I feel like I need to know
everything, everything about you,

767
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:30,230
~ and I want you to know
everything about me. ~ Yeah, well...

768
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:32,600
.. we will, lad. We will.

769
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:07,760
Good morning.

770
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:10,710
Oh, hello.

771
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:12,750
How long have you been up?

772
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:15,310
I couldn't get comfortable.

773
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:17,110
Then I got heartburn, again.

774
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:19,910
Then I had to get up to
pee, about 19 times.

775
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:22,870
And then I got all excited,
thinking about being married to you.

776
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:24,200
Aww.

777
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:29,270
Aren't you simple?

778
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:30,310
Just think,

779
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:34,630
in just over three hours' time we'll
be shackled to each other forever.

780
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:36,190
Have you chosen a poem?

781
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:37,510
I might have.

782
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:39,590
I don't want to be the only one
reading out a poem.

783
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:42,190
~ I might have written one.
~ Have you? ~ Might have.

784
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:43,360
No, have you?

785
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,830
My love is like a hot water bottle.

786
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:48,430
That's so flattering, Caroline.

787
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:50,190
My love is like a thermal vest.

788
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:52,510
God, you've really
missed your metier, haven't you?

789
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:55,040
Shall I compare thee
to my Jeep Cherokee?

790
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:57,280
Go on, then.

791
00:46:58,600 --> 00:46:59,960
Thou art more...

792
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:02,520
More...?

793
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:07,190
Built like a tank and guzzles diesel
like it's going out of fashion?

794
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:10,030
Yeah, OK. I've not thought
that one through.

795
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:12,160
Yeah, well, you've got three hours.

796
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:14,800
Caroline.

797
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:18,040
Caroline?

798
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:43,670
Eh, I'm thinking
I might wear this suit.

799
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:46,310
It's the one I wore
when we got wed first time

800
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:49,670
~ in register office in Halifax.
~ Right.

801
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:52,110
What about you?

802
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:53,390
What about me?

803
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:54,990
Well, what are you wearing?

804
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:57,270
I'm not going.

805
00:47:57,320 --> 00:47:58,950
What do you mean?

806
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,070
I can't stand there, smiling.

807
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:04,470
Nobody's going to thank me
if I stand there looking like
a wet weekend.

808
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:06,670
Well, I think you should make
an effort.

809
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:09,670
~ It's Caroline's big day...
~ Big day?

810
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:12,990
~ Getting married to another woman?
~ But...

811
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:18,230
You were just saying how nice it were
when Kate popped round.

812
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:20,360
Yeah, well, that was yesterday.

813
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:23,520
Oh, Celia...

814
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:27,960
Don't let this other
business spoil...

815
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:32,510
~ Where did you do it?
~ What?

816
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:35,550
Sex. You and Mary?

817
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:36,870
I'm not going there...

818
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:39,270
I'm assuming you couldn't take her
back to your house,

819
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:42,310
because Gillian
and Eileen would be there.

820
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:44,910
And who did she live with?
Her mum and dad,

821
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:47,670
~ so that wouldn't have been
an option. ~ I don't want...

822
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:50,310
In a stationery cupboard at Jessops?

823
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:51,790
In the back of your car?

824
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:54,110
Fumbling about with her knickers.

825
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:55,550
In the same car, possibly,

826
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:59,560
that you'd brought Gillian back from
the hospital in when she was born.

827
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:03,230
Then going back to Eileen...

828
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:05,160
.. smelling of HER.

829
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:08,480
I'm not Kenneth.

830
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:11,430
The night Caroline was born,

831
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:16,230
the night I lost all that blood
and I had to have that transfusion.

832
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:19,590
I found out afterwards he'd been
having it off with someone else.

833
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:21,840
Kenneth, that same night.

834
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:26,030
I was in hospital, I nearly died,

835
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:28,920
and he was off,
shagging one of his tarts.

836
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:32,750
Do you know what that does to you?

837
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:36,000
To your self-esteem?
Have you any idea?

838
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:40,240
And the year Gillian was born...

839
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:44,920
.. you're mucking about
with somebody's secretary.

840
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:55,880
~ Ten minutes, then we'd better...
~ Yeah.

841
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:00,470
You nervous?

842
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:01,600
Are you?

843
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:07,520
~ Can I tell you something?
~ What?

844
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:12,910
Can I tell you how grateful
I am to you, for...

845
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:15,640
.. giving me the strength
and the courage to...

846
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:18,680
.. stop hiding.

847
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:21,880
You're magnificent.

848
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:25,910
You're very pretty.

849
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:27,350
Do you remember that day?

850
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:29,830
That was so mad!
Snogging in your office.

851
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:34,350
It was more than a snog, pal.
I had my hand inside your bra.

852
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:39,280
Alan. It's open!

853
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:45,150
~ Good morning! ~ Yes. Hello, love.

854
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:46,350
Very smart!

855
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:48,840
Oh, yes. Well...

856
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:51,720
We've, I've...

857
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:55,520
There's a problem with your mum.

858
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:07,510
Mum, you need to get dressed.

859
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:10,150
He's no better than your father.

860
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:13,110
~ Mum, I want you to get dressed.
~ Did you hear what I said?

861
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:16,160
~ I did. However,
today isn't about that. ~ Look...

862
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:19,470
.. please don't take this
the wrong way,

863
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:22,110
~ but you don't mind
if I don't come, do you? ~ Yes.

864
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:24,990
Yes, I do, actually.
I really want you to be there.

865
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:27,110
I'd only make everyone miserable.

866
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:29,390
You'll make ME miserable
if you don't come.

867
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:31,710
But Kate's mother's not going
to be there.

868
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:33,750
That's because she's in America.

869
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:36,470
She's working, she's going to come
and spend the summer with us,

870
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:38,400
all the more reason
why you SHOULD be there.

871
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:44,590
I was fair looking forward to it.
I'd bought an outfit.

872
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:47,200
~ And a hat.
~ Good, put them on.

873
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:52,950
Oh, Mum.

874
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,110
You've got to separate
what's between you and Alan

875
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:56,670
from this, today.

876
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:58,600
Because they're not connected.

877
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:02,560
I really want you to be there,
Mum.

878
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:06,800
Mum. Get dressed.

879
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:11,520
You'll have a nice day
with your friends.

880
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:17,430
Do you remember when I got
my doctorate? The degree ceremony.

881
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:20,830
And you didn't come. My dad turned
up, and I said, "Where's mum?",

882
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:24,030
and he looked a bit apologetic
and he said, "Oh she's not here".

883
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:25,510
You'd obviously had an argument.

884
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:28,470
And I was really rude to him.
I said...

885
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:30,990
"Well there's no point you being
here if she's not here".

886
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:34,750
And it really hurt him, I could see.

887
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:37,750
He'd bothered to come all that way
and you hadn't,

888
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:40,310
and I was rude to him. It was the
biggest day of my life

889
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:43,030
and you weren't there cos you'd had
an argument with him

890
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:44,830
about God knows what, but I
certainly

891
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:46,230
wasn't part of the
equation

892
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:48,680
when you decided not to come.

893
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:54,470
It was always me that took
an interest in everything you did,

894
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:55,590
not him.

895
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:59,070
The facts on that occasion would
suggest otherwise.

896
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:01,990
I'd looked forward to that day
so much.

897
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:05,790
I'd imagined it, I'd imagined you,
both of you, in Oxford -

898
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:08,870
taking you out for lunch,
showing you round my college,

899
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:11,310
introducing you to my friends.

900
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:13,110
I had no idea you weren't
coming until

901
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:17,150
I saw my dad on his own
down Cornmarket. I was devastated.

902
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:20,910
I was gutted. I know you've had
an upset,

903
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:24,830
but these things are not connected
and if you do this to me again,

904
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:26,630
then there's absolutely no point

905
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:29,560
in pretending that we
have any kind of a relationship.

906
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:36,520
Please, Mum. Get dressed.

907
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:46,880
Right.

908
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:21,710
All right?
What is this...? Brilliant.

909
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:22,990
Where's Lawrence?

910
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:26,120
I don't know.
I expect he'll come with the others.

911
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:40,400
Whoa, granny! Nice outfit.

912
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:45,230
She says she's not going.

913
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:46,680
Why?

914
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:51,510
I don't want to go either.

915
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:53,350
Oh, now come on!

916
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:55,830
You can stay here with me
if you like, chicken.

917
00:54:55,880 --> 00:54:57,950
I thought you said you'd
invited Angus.

918
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,870
You can't have Angus turning up
on his own,

919
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:01,790
he'll have no-one to sit with.

920
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:04,150
Hey, and what about your mother?

921
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:06,000
You all right, Gran?

922
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:09,280
I'm staying here.

923
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:12,760
You'll regret this.

924
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:15,680
Both of you. You'll regret it.

925
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:19,550
What's happened?

926
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:21,710
Please. Please. Both of you.

927
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:25,160
Think about Caroline.
She doesn't deserve this.

928
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:43,280
I'm so glad you could come.

929
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:47,830
~ You look great! ~ Oh, thank you.

930
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:49,750
I'm glad you could make it.

931
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:53,110
~ Where's Lawrence?
~ He's coming with, um...

932
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:54,680
Oh, Gran and Alan are here.

933
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:15,040
Should we all be heading inside?

934
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:19,950
I'm sorry, love.
I tried to persuade her.

935
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:25,080
And then Lawrence came round
and then he wouldn't come either.

936
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:33,430
Well, there's no point you being
here then. Is there?

937
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:35,640
If she's not here.

938
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:53,350
~ What's going on?
Are you not at the wedding? ~ No.

939
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:55,590
I, Caroline Elizabeth Dawson...

940
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:58,630
Do take you, Katherine Abike
McKenzie, to be my lawfully

941
00:56:58,680 --> 00:56:59,750
wedded wife.

942
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:01,750
~ I've got all this money...
~ Why don't we get married?

943
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:03,390
I think we could be comfortable.

944
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:05,110
Have I got anything to say to you?

945
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:06,830
I don't want to fall out with you.

946
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:08,870
You're your own worst enemy.

947
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:13,080
~ Where you going? ~ Home. To Halifax.
If that's what you really want.
