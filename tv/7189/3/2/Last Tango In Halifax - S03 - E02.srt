1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,638
Guess the latest.

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:04,472
We've decided
we're going to get married.

3
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:06,229
Right.

4
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:08,436
GILLIAN: <i>You know my date with Gary?</i>

5
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:10,238
<i>Wasn't me he was interested in.</i>

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,878
<i>He thinks you had a fling</i>

7
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:13,791
<i>with his mother.</i>
<i>And that you're his dad.</i>

8
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:16,440
I didn't know there'd been a child.

9
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:18,192
- You all right?
- JOHN: <i>Judith's, um...</i>

10
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:21,192
She's lost the baby. It's been awful.

11
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:22,793
I got your text.

12
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,795
- It's true.
- (CHUCKLING)

13
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:28,314
They can't expect you
to sell your house in 28 days.

14
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,197
And how else is he going to raise
that kind of money?

15
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,793
- What's up?
- Nothing.

16
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:34,519
Someone is going to
have to tell my mother at some point

17
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,397
and if none of you do, I will.

18
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,349
He'd like to meet you.

19
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:39,429
Gary?

20
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,873
Alan, hello.

21
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:59,523
<b><font color="#004F8C">Ripped By mstoll</font></b>

22
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,749
- It's a bit a shock.
- Yes.

23
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,913
For both of us, well, for all of us.

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,831
- I mean, Gillian, too.
- Yeah, yes.

25
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,918
I didn't sleep much last night.

26
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,672
Uh, yeah...

27
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,873
I didn't want to, um...

28
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,269
I just...

29
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,275
Sorry, I realise

30
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:01,158
I don't actually have
anything to say as such, it's just...

31
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:05,555
I was intrigued to meet you,
to see you, I suppose. That's all.

32
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,789
She never told me she were...

33
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:12,111
Your mum, she never...
Did Gillian tell you?

34
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,716
And Gillian's lovely, by the way.

35
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,994
- Oh!
- (BOTH CHUCKLE)

36
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,310
- Well...
- She's just so funny,

37
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,197
so sweet, so uncomplicated.

38
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,434
(CHUCKLES)

39
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,671
Her heart's in right place.

40
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,679
So, what was he upset for?

41
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,034
I thought he never wanted it.

42
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:40,040
(CHUCKLES) Well, no. He didn't.

43
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,394
I don't know.

44
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:44,040
I've had all this second-hand
from Caroline.

45
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,839
Still, I suppose if it was
nearly full-term...

46
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,953
Oh, God knows
what she must have gone through.

47
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,114
Are they even together still?
I mean, were they ever?

48
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,714
Really, actually? After a certain point?

49
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,199
God knows.

50
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,829
Well, she's cleared off, anyway,

51
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,832
she's gone to live with
her sister in St Albans.

52
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:06,995
And he's been sleeping
in Caroline's spare room again,

53
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,433
- apparently.
- Really?

54
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,635
Hmm.

55
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:13,599
She's very good to him, Caroline,
given what a bugger he's been.

56
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,639
If it was me,

57
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,917
he'd have not darkened the doorstep
ever again.

58
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,878
No, no. No.

59
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,989
How...

60
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,799
Can I ask how you met?

61
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,429
Um...

62
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,038
Well, I married Eileen, Gillian's mum,
in, uh, 1957.

63
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,432
But the woman I really wanted to marry,

64
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:41,433
the one that I was in love with,
she'd stood me up.

65
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,074
Except she hadn't.

66
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:47,789
She left me a message, only...

67
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,510
- I never got it.
- Celia?

68
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,678
That's right.

69
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,154
I were very fond of Eileen

70
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:01,431
but truth is
I got engaged to her on rebound.

71
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,795
I don't think we'd have
called it that then.

72
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:08,431
And I certainly weren't aware that
that's what I were doing, but yeah.

73
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,112
Then I met your mum.

74
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,349
At Jessop's Chemicals up Huddersfield.

75
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:19,113
She were a secretary and... (SIGHS)

76
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,873
She reminded me of Celia.

77
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:25,752
The second I saw her,
everything about her.

78
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,276
The way her eyes lit up when she smiled.

79
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,511
Way she walked.

80
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,479
I felt the same feeling I felt
when I were with Celia.

81
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,595
It was...

82
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,513
I don't know.

83
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,958
Like world lit up.

84
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,196
And we were weak.

85
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,670
We were daft.

86
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,513
We were old enough to know better,
it shouldn't have happened.

87
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,759
But it did.

88
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,269
Then she left.

89
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,032
I never saw her again.

90
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,190
Did you try to see her again?

91
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,273
No.

92
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,554
I suppose

93
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,273
if I had known,

94
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,072
I'd like to think that

95
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,671
I'd have done right thing.

96
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,518
It would have been more...

97
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,991
complicated, obviously.

98
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,912
No, she should have told me.

99
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,591
She should have told me at the time.

100
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:31,276
However difficult it might have been
for everybody.

101
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:43,590
So you're not coming to this
"wedding", then?

102
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,719
She did ask me.

103
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,713
Only I said we were busy.

104
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,275
And aren't you?

105
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,357
(SIGHS) I don't think
she really wanted me there.

106
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:55,113
I think she only invited me
'cause she thought she should.

107
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,236
I think you're being a bit sensitive.

108
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:00,392
If she didn't want you, she wouldn't
ask you. You know what she's like.

109
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,073
Who else is going?

110
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,037
William's coming up from Oxford.

111
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,118
A few people from school.

112
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,872
Couple of her pals from Oxford.

113
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,235
I don't know about Kate's family.

114
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,394
Fairly small.
It's all a bit last-minute.

115
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,036
You know, not everyone's available.

116
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,034
Our Muriel's in Corfu, sadly.

117
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,554
So... John's living at the house

118
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:29,359
and Kate's on leave now
so she's at home all day

119
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,109
with John?

120
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,432
Well, yeah, presumably.

121
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,476
'Cause he's never at work, is he?

122
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,357
I don't know why they pay him.

123
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:40,949
(CHUCKLING)

124
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,073
MIDWIFE: Contractions are good.

125
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:47,916
They're painful
but they're on your side.

126
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:51,670
Your contractions happen
when your uterus contracts

127
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:55,309
and that's what dilates
or opens the cervix.

128
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,309
Now, Dads,

129
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,439
during labour,

130
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,798
you may find it distressing
to see your partner in so much pain.

131
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,999
Is this your first?

132
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,399
Not your first?

133
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,355
(STAMMERING) It's not my first.

134
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,668
It's Kate's first.

135
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,190
So you'll know what I'm talking about.

136
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,840
It is distressing

137
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:23,310
but you just being there,
gently encouraging her to keep going,

138
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,868
that is so important.

139
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:31,630
It's... It's not actually mine as such.
I'm just, uh...

140
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,076
Kate's my wife's girlfriend.

141
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:45,756
Okay, so let's talk about pain relief.

142
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,153
(CAR APPROACHING)

143
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,319
(LAUGHING)

144
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,230
We're back! Dad?

145
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,318
Oh, my feet!

146
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,197
Oh, Calamity,
you are getting heavier by the hour.

147
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,679
I'm making you some tea.

148
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,749
Well...

149
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,151
I think I spent up, Alan.

150
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,388
You better not have.

151
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:33,234
(SOFTLY) Not if we are thinking about
this Australasian adventure.

152
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,359
Are we serious?

153
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,352
I am if you are.

154
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:40,519
Why are we whispering? Is it a secret?

155
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,829
No, it isn't.

156
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,071
So, you've been busy?

157
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,837
Eh, no, no, no.

158
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:53,474
Right, I'll pop this lot upstairs
and then I can relax.

159
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,551
- Can you manage?
- Oh, yeah.

160
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,308
Tea, coffee?

161
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,919
- Jäger bomb?
- Uh...

162
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,309
Tea, thanks, love.

163
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,353
Have you had a nice time?

164
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,950
Clothes shopping with my mother-in-law?

165
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,951
No, stepmother.

166
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,589
Yeah.

167
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,753
Yeah. It was a bit of a laugh.

168
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,957
- How did you get on?
- Fine.

169
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:25,319
- Yeah?
- Like you said, he seems like a

170
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,235
- very nice fella.
- Yeah, yeah.

171
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,677
- It's odd.
- What?

172
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,799
I felt like I knew him.

173
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:34,995
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

174
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,229
Yeah, and so did I.

175
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,550
From the moment I saw his face.

176
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,838
So, what did he say? What did he want?

177
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,269
Nothing.

178
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,549
No, I didn't think he did.

179
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,835
- I think he just wanted to...
- He just wanted to talk, yeah.

180
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,435
Wish I could have stopped
with him longer but, uh...

181
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,150
Any road, he asked me
if we'd like to go and have a meal.

182
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,674
- Meet Felicity, his wife.
- Oh.

183
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,035
So, he's, um... He's married, then?

184
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,838
Yeah, they've two girls.

185
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,798
Yeah, and he meant all of us,
you know, you, me, Raff, Ellie.

186
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,875
Calamity.

187
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:08,313
Celia, he said he'd like to meet Celia.

188
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,109
I said, uh...

189
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,110
"Well, I haven't told her yet." (SIGHS)

190
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:15,869
So?

191
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,112
Oh, I don't know.

192
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,674
You have got to tell her.

193
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,318
I had Caroline on the phone
a couple of days ago

194
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:24,631
and she said if we... Well, if you
don't tell Celia, she will.

195
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,315
Oh, what the hell were you doing
telling Caroline for?

196
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,879
I told you.

197
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,076
Look, she wasn't being nasty.

198
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,549
To be fair to her, it's 'cause she knows

199
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,632
how upset Celia was
when she found out about Kenneth.

200
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,555
You know, she'd been

201
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,390
cheated on, lied to.

202
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,755
And isn't it best to be honest, really?

203
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,196
Coming from you,
sooner rather than later.

204
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:52,196
I told Caroline that you wanted to meet
him first and then you'd tell her.

205
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,269
Celia.

206
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,999
And she was fine with that.

207
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:58,633
But now you have met him, so...

208
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,709
Okay.

209
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,635
- So...
- Yeah, I'll tell her.

210
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,438
- When?
- Soon.

211
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,275
Soon!

212
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:14,438
CAROLINE:
Well, why did you let him go with you?

213
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,509
Because...

214
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,238
I don't know, he just tagged along.

215
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,470
Of course I was daft enough
to feel sorry for him.

216
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,468
I should have said,
right in front of everyone,

217
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,039
"She's not your wife,

218
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,270
"she's your ex-wife,
John, you're divorced."

219
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,395
You... You should have done.

220
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,516
"She's my wife's girlfriend."
She's my wife.

221
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,398
Very nearly. "And you're just,
I don't know, a friend of the family."

222
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,677
Well, no, no. He's more than that,
he's the father of...

223
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:37,749
Still.

224
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,312
No need to split hairs.

225
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,630
"I know you've had an upset
but can I just be blunt?

226
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,551
"You really, really need to move out,

227
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,517
"John, before me and Caroline
get married."

228
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,472
Yes. Well, good.

229
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:50,869
You should have said it.

230
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,713
All that money that we have begged,
borrowed and stolen

231
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,677
to buy his half of the house.
What's the problem?

232
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,920
I don't think we've stolen anything,
have we?

233
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,119
Whatever.

234
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,597
What is the problem?

235
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,318
Just say it.

236
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,554
Can't you?

237
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,389
Sure.

238
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,358
- Yes!
- Damn.

239
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,632
I'll deal with it later.

240
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,991
I will deal with it later.

241
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,871
They're playing a game.

242
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,951
If I go into labour,
he comes nowhere near the hospital.

243
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,712
Course he won't.

244
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,195
What's the matter?

245
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,914
(VOICE BREAKING) I don't know.

246
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:58,078
I don't know. Maybe I'm just frightened.

247
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,913
Don't be frightened.

248
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,914
I'm not that much younger than Judith.

249
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,913
Judith's an alcoholic.

250
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,797
And what if there's something
wrong with it?

251
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,471
There won't be. Why would there be?

252
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:17,030
And if there is, we'll deal with it,
but there won't be. So.

253
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,076
And you will get rid of him?

254
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,599
I will ask him

255
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,673
to leave.

256
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,276
Oh, God, I ought to ring my mum.

(MOBILE RINGING)

258
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:51,989
Hello.

259
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,833
<i>Mum, hi, it's me. How are you?</i>

260
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,639
- Very well, love.
<i>- Good.</i>

261
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,109
<i>Good.</i>

262
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,955
How's Alan?

263
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,112
Um, he's fine. Caroline says how's Alan?

264
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,111
- He's fine, love.
<i>- Good.</i>

265
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,719
<i>So, er...</i>

266
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,360
Good. So I've got nothing fresh
that I can think of.

267
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,429
Have you?

268
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,712
Um, no, I don't think so.
Have we got anything fresh, Alan?

269
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,151
Eh, no, no, no, no.

270
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,149
(WHISPERING) He's not told her.

271
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:22,312
We thought we'd drive over on Friday,

272
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,595
the day before the wedding.

273
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:28,675
<i>Then if there's anything you want doing,</i>
<i>I can help out.</i>

274
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,239
Right, good. Thank you.

00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,753
CELIA: Did you decide on your outfit?

278
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:37,989
Hello, love.

279
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,594
- Where you been?
- Supermarket. Greenhough's.

280
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,033
Not answering your phone?

281
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,314
Oh, has it been ringing?

282
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,118
Harvey said you had an argument
with Mr Streplewhite.

283
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,269
- Yeah, I did.
- Which one's he?

284
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,634
- Politics.
- Politics. I told him

285
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,278
he can shove his coursework up his arse

286
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,669
and I've left and I've got a job
at Greenhough's.

287
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,399
You can't do that.

288
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,229
Well, I just did.

289
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,877
You can't not do your A levels.

290
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,598
Hey, what's... What's happened?

291
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:03,877
Well, no, I can not do them.
And then I can earn some money.

292
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:06,315
Have you... Have you
talked to your mum about it?

293
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:09,195
No way. She has enough going
worrying about me granddad.

294
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,429
Well, I think you need to.

295
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,636
- Well, it's none of her business.
- No, Ellie, it is!

296
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,996
She's going to be very upset
if you're going to drop out

297
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,308
of doing your A levels.

298
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,231
You can't work at Greenhough's,

299
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,117
that's just a job, it's not a career.

ALAN: You're a clever lass.

301
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,949
You don't want to just go
chucking it all down the drain.

No! Listen!

It's good. It's full-time.

He said I can go on a fast-track.
He said I can be a store manager.

305
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,592
In a couple of years, if I put the hours
in and I play me cards right,

306
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,511
there's all sorts of opportunities.

307
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,909
- Wow.
- It's money, Raff.

308
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,238
It's not being dependent
on every bloody body.

309
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,394
And it isn't like I've got
that many people to be dependent on now,

310
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,311
with me granddad being such a loony.

He hasn't told her.

322
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:16,633
No, no, no. Uh, not yet.

323
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,914
<i>He needs to tell her.</i>

324
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,389
I know, he will.

325
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,478
He needs to tell her soon.

326
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:26,391
Yes, I know. I agree with you.
I'm working on it.

327
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,789
(MOUTHING)

328
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,676
CELIA: Well, that may be the case.

329
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,357
I do like Kate, you know.

330
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:41,429
I suppose if Caroline had to be that
way, she could have done a lot worse.

331
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:44,709
It's funny, isn't it?

332
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,315
Babies.

333
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:49,235
They're always welcome when they come.

334
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,632
Even when they're unexpected.

335
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,357
Like our little Calamity.

336
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,833
And now, there's this other one.

337
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,598
I know there's something bothering you.

338
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,318
I'd wish you'd let on what it is.

339
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:08,875
Is it Harry?

340
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,194
And that damn silly mess
he's got himself into?

341
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,114
Well, what, then?

342
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,158
I've had a bit of news.

343
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,309
What news?

344
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:33,557
I've been in two minds
about whether to tell you or not.

345
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,715
What news?

346
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,552
Oh, no, it's not an ordeal. I...

347
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:44,109
I suppose there's a lot about each other

348
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,872
that we still don't know, isn't there?

349
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:48,190
(CHUCKLES) Is there?

350
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:51,597
Well, 60-odd years not seeing someone,

351
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,517
there's bound to be one or two.

352
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,550
What? One or two what?

353
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,591
It turns out I've got a...

354
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,958
skeleton in cupboard.

355
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,474
What do you mean?

356
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,953
One I never even knew I had.

357
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,551
Well, not...

358
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,476
What? What is it?

359
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:24,348
Oh, I don't care what it is, Alan,

360
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,476
you can tell me anything.

361
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:30,156
Nothing's worth making yourself
ill over, just tell me.

362
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,200
Just say it. Just spit it out.

363
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,556
You'll think I'm like Kenneth.

364
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,315
How could you ever be like Kenneth?

365
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,878
I've got a lad.

366
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,194
A son.

367
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,639
A boy I never knew I had.

368
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,109
Well, I call him lad, he's a man now.

369
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,549
You see...

370
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,311
I had a bit of a fling.

371
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,435
When?

372
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,108
Oh, years ago.

373
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,238
Before you were married?

374
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:12,909
No.

375
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,669
No.

376
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,636
Celia, look,
I don't want to make excuses,

377
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,153
it happened, it shouldn't have.

378
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,310
But I didn't know there'd been a child.

379
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:28,989
When?

380
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,156
Year our Gillian were born.

381
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,034
Only, as I said, I've only just...

382
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,270
The year Gillian was born?

383
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,355
But you'd...

384
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:43,193
You'd been married nine years
when Gillian

385
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,469
was born.

386
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,553
- Who was she?
- Oh, you wouldn't know her.

387
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,869
They lived up Siddal.

388
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,269
Mary.

389
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,476
She were called Mary. Mary Kershaw.

390
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:10,150
Came to work at Jessop's,
she were a secretary.

391
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,229
She, um...

392
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,598
She had a look of you.

393
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,754
The year Gillian was born, you were...

394
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,317
Well, did Eileen know?

395
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,389
No.

396
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:34,713
It's like I said to Gillian,
it stopped before it started.

397
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,358
It were never...

398
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,156
What does Gillian know about it?

399
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,194
Her date on Valentine's Day.

400
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:47,512
It weren't a date as such.

401
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,473
It were him.

402
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,633
- Well, how long did it go on?
- We didn't.

403
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,873
Long enough to get her pregnant.

404
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:00,155
Only the once.

405
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:04,076
Then she left. I...
I never saw her again.

406
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,319
I had no idea she were...

407
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,991
CELIA: So, what does he want, this Gary?

408
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:19,115
Nothing. He just wanted to meet me.

409
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,474
And you're going to?

410
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,554
Well, thing is I already have.

411
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:28,596
I met him this morning
when you and Gillian went shopping.

412
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,477
And he's a grand fella, Celia,

413
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:35,074
he's very keen to meet you, genuinely.

414
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:38,277
He's the sort of person who genuinely

415
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,510
seems to be interested in people.

416
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,794
So, hang on.

417
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:45,637
He just rang, out of the blue
this morning,

418
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,276
when Gillian and me just happened
to be out shopping?

419
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,759
No, no, no, no.

420
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:53,113
He... It were, it were arranged.

421
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,193
Gillian arranged it.

422
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,878
Oh, so you were just getting me
out of the way.

423
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,473
No!

424
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,754
Yeah... Look...

425
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:06,396
- It were delicate.
- Where? Where did you meet him?

426
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,235
In a café.

427
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,035
Right.

428
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:13,556
Look, I understand you probably rather
I'd told you first.

429
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:16,791
No, I'd rather you didn't lie to me
about what you were doing.

430
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,077
But obviously I were worried
about how you'd react.

431
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:23,072
You see? This is what adultery does
to people.

432
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,832
It turns them into liars.

433
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:29,070
Well, no wonder
you couldn't have Calamity.

434
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:32,152
No wonder we had to
trail around with...

435
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,959
It's been difficult,
knowing right thing to do!

436
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:37,031
And right order to do stuff in.

437
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,236
And of course Gillian's been upset.

438
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:44,318
But not above colluding with you
about deceiving me.

439
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,152
Nobody wanted to deceive you.

440
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,516
It was just about knowing
when and how to tell you!

441
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,549
Well...

442
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,838
you've told me now.

443
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,394
Have you seen Ellie?

444
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,959
Yeah, she were up at quarter past six.

445
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,917
She was off to catch
the ten to seven bus.

446
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,192
She's to be at Greenhough's
at half past.

447
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:16,314
She didn't discuss this with me
at all, nothing.

448
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,758
You need to be communicating
with each other more.

449
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,239
Oh, no shit.

450
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,788
No, I'm not being an unpaid nanny
if she's out earning money.

451
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,996
You know, that is, that is not
the way the world works.

452
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:28,038
This isn't cloud cuckoo land.
Also, plus Yvonne

453
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:30,634
is slinging me cash every week
for her housekeeping, which...

454
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,079
I can't accept that.

455
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,390
I'm not accepting that
if Ellie's working.

456
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,876
Did she even speak
to her mother last night?

457
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,188
No idea!

458
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:42,238
Do you just not talk to each other
at all, about anything?

459
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,469
Hello!

460
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,312
Oh, right. Well, I'll have to
bang on at her about it, then.

461
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,549
Oh, feel free!

462
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,437
Well, I'll see you later.
I'm on a shift.

463
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:52,035
After I've done every bloody thing else
for every bugger else.

464
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,511
What's up with Celia and me granddad?

465
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,071
What is up with Celia and your granddad?

466
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,913
They sat at the breakfast table
not speaking to each other.

467
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:12,589
Has summat happened?
They were up in night, I heard them.

468
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,432
No, I don't think...

469
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,231
Is one of them ill?

470
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:22,038
No. No, nothing like that, just...

471
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:29,319
It turns out I've got a brother.

472
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,029
A half-brother

473
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,275
that I didn't know about.

474
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:36,869
How?

475
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:41,275
(CHUCKLING) You what?

476
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,997
I would like you to meet him.

477
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,712
You see, I think you'd like him.

478
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,873
He'd like to meet you.

479
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,073
I can't imagine why.

480
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:13,558
He's very... I don't know, calm.

481
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,709
He's mannered, kindly,

482
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:20,198
unusual.
I were nervous about going to meet him.

483
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:23,989
But no, he just seemed to be wanting
to make sense of it himself

484
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,832
and apologising

485
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,756
and saying that he knew
it was a shock for all of us.

486
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:35,196
He were being very grown-up
about the whole thing, I suppose.

487
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:38,792
And you want me to be grown-up
about it, too.

488
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,549
Well...

489
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,793
either we can
move forward together or...

490
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,993
I don't know what alternative is.

491
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,597
Maybe I should go
and stay with Caroline for a few days.

492
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:02,236
Caroline knows, by the way.

493
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:05,714
Caroline? What the hell does Caroline
know about it?

494
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:08,519
Gillian wanted to talk to her
before she told me,

495
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,999
after she met him, Gary.

496
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,432
Anyway, she thought

497
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,715
Caroline would know best way forward.

498
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:20,635
So Kate will know about it as well,
won't she?

499
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,436
I mean, does everybody know except me?

500
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,909
No. No!

501
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,916
Yes, but of course
I discussed it with Kate.

502
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,309
I'm allowed to, she's my partner.

503
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,958
We tell each other things.

504
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:41,638
CELIA: You see, this is what I used to
hate about your dad.

505
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:44,314
Him mucking about
and then everybody knowing.

506
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,990
And then you find out and you realise

507
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:49,150
they've been laughing at you
behind your back.

508
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,558
Or else feeling sorry for you.

509
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:52,993

Not in this instance.
Nobody's like that.

513
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,994
I'm so shocked, Caroline.

514
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,432
I thought he was different.

515
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,679

516
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,590
I thought he was better than that.

517

You know, when you haven't
seen someone for 60 years,

518
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,988

you don't know.

521
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,912

And you know,

522
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,479
this isn't about you

523
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:36,154
and I think you need to
try and step back from it.

524
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,310
He went and met him

525
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,639

526
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,872
Yeah, yeah.

Why didn't you tell me?

530
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,918
I was going to, I told Gillian,

531
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,070
I said, "If you don't hurry up
and tell her, I will."

straight over there two days ago

00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,829

and shoved it...

542
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,517
if I thought for one second

543
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,875
that he was taking the mickey
out of you, I'd deal with him.

544
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,315
I don't think he is.
I think he's a good man.

and I bet he's doing his damndest now

to make things right,
because I would imagine

547
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:38,590
he is terrified,

<i>- Hmm.</i>

00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:09,913
where monkeys shove their nuts.
I've had enough

642
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,479
of being talked to like...

643
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:14,358
- Well, what happened?
- Nothing, just...

644
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:16,749
Him saying how I'm always trouble.

645
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:21,276
- Me, I know! Always late. Really?
- (TURNS TV OFF)

646
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,390
Twice in the last... month.

647
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,914
Always mouthing off, apparently.

648
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,470
Only because I'm sticking up for people,
other people.

649
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,915
Against him being a fascist dictator.

650
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,352
I said, I told him,

651
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:41,070
"My father was a union man,
so I'm not apologising."

652
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:44,513
And then him just going on about
how I'm always...

653
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,999
Whatever. So, I just said, "Fine!

654
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,798
"Fine, you know what?

655
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:52,952
"Fine. You know, for me,
this is win-win."

656
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,748
So you lost your job.

657
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:59,079
No I... I resigned.

658
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:01,037
So, how is it win-win?

659
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:06,274
I get time off and I don't have to
listen to that jackass

660
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:08,271
telling me what to do any more.

661
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,918
Oh, you pillock.

662
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,629
Where's Celia?

663
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,914
Oh, she were here before I nodded off.

664
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,516
Where... Is the Lexus outside?

665
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,589
Yeah.

666
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,109
Celia?

667
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,871
CELIA: I'm just upstairs.

668
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,271
- Did you tell her?
- Yeah.

669
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:36,313
- Yeah, and?
- No, she's fine.

670
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,869
Fine how?

671
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:43,396
Obviously it were a shock to start with,
but, uh...

672
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:46,950
Well, I don't know, Caroline seemed
to talk some sense into her.

673
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,428
Yeah, and

674
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,359
come and have a look at this.

675
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:55,835
I googled him.

676
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:57,953
Do you realise who he is?

677
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,674
You'll not believe it.

678
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,390
He's a real mover and shaker.

679
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:05,390
You'll not credit what he's achieved.

680
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:07,953
- Blimey.
- Yeah.

681
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,309
God.

682
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,669
- Huddersfield Town.
- He owns it.

683
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,194
Hmm, maybe he'll give me a job
cutting the astroturf.

684
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,269
I'll ask him.

685
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:19,669
I rang him. We're all going to tea
on Friday.

686
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:23,309
- Tea?
- Supper, dinner. A meal,

687
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,913
7:00 for 7:30.

688
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:28,592
Oh, I'll have to tell Raff.

689
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:32,153
Oh, yeah, I... already told him.

690
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:35,480
No, he heard you get up in the night
and he was worried you were ill.

691
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,312
- So I...
- How did he...

692
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:42,837
Well, he thought it was "well cool"
I think were the exact words.

693
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:45,434
The fact that you'd been unfaithful
to my mother appeared to go

694
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,511
right over his pretty little head.

695
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,310
But then again, he's a bloke, so...

696
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,759
What are you doing?

697
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,114
I'm going to Harrogate.

698
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,198
- Hello, love.
- Celia.

699
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,679
I don't want to make a fuss.

700
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:01,639
I'm happy for you to go
and have dinner with this Gary.

701
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,278
I can see you're all excited about it

702
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:06,716
and I understand why, he's obviously
a very successful young man.

703
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,314
But I personally
would find it difficult

704
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:12,912
so if it's all right with everyone here,
I'd rather be in Harrogate.

705
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,037
Celia, it's not because he's successful,

706
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:18,588
it's because, well,
he's flesh and blood.

707
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:21,435
Yes, well. Whatever it is,
he'll understand.

708
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,829
But he was particular
in wanting to meet you.

709
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,912
It's you he's interested in
and that's fine.

710
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,355
Like I say, I don't want to be
small-minded about it

711
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:33,149
but equally, you'll understand
if I don't want to be there.

712
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:37,038
And anyway, it's the wedding
the next day

713
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,954
and she might want me over there
Friday night,

714
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,719
in case there's anything wants doing.

715
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:44,475
Okay. I won't go.

716
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:49,272
No, you're going. I'm not having that.
You're going.

00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:07,316
I thought I might cook this evening
for everyone.

720
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,072
As a sort of thank you.

721
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:10,388
I bought steak.

- No.

No, I can't do nuts
but other than that...

724

727

I mean, I love the boys, obviously,
I wouldn't swap them, but secretly,

728
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,597
I always wanted a little girl, too.

729
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:36,072
But Caroline didn't want to have
any more after the boys came along.

I'm really sorry
about what's happened, John.

Yes, I know you are.

You've both been very kind.

- I resigned.
- She resigned.

739

- What happened?
- Nothing.

I wouldn't have, Gillian.

Well, what happened?

748
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:43,638
There was an incident at work
involving Cheryl, who clearly has...

749
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:48,631
(CLEARING THROAT)... some form of
borderline personality disorder

750

I, um, can't turn it off.

Carry on!

Perhaps we should have a chat,
Gillian, in my office?

- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

756

So, he said it was a final warning
and I resigned.

Hang on, why would Cheryl
do something like that?

758
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,631
- Because she's deranged.
- And she's thick.

Not that she can help it.

760

Just wanted to say I was sorry.

that she...

764
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:39,789

calling the kettle black, eh?

798
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:27,392
ALAN: Oh, no.
GILLIAN: Oh, yes.

799
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:29,436
All these years.

800
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:33,035
Listen, and, I wasn't the other woman,
she was.

801
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:35,429
Me and Robbie, we just,
we just had a bit of a blip, that's all,

802
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:39,513
because of that loudmouth,
alcoholic bitch sticking her nebby...

803
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:41,352
- Which?
- Judith.

804
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:44,193
We're not going to parade all this
in front of Gary, are we?

805
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:46,271
What? All our dirty linen?

806
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:47,713
Oh, hell no.

807
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:52,316
We don't want him thinking
any of us have sex, do we, eh? Granddad?

808
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,118
(ALL LAUGHING)

809
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:03,189
RAFF: Where the hell are we?
ELLIE: We're lost.

810
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:06,317
RAFF: I think it looks dead creepy.
ELLIE: Hmm, so do I.

811
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,072
God, this is dark.

812
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:10,674
I'm wondering if that was a wrong turn.

813
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:14,548
Now, for this one, we took way back
when we came off main road.

814
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:15,789
Well, now he says it!

815
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:19,154
Shit!

816
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:22,630
- What was that?
- No, we are all right. Keep going.

817
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:25,029
The worst that can happen
is we'll end up in Slough.

818
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:27,516
It's like we're in
<i>The Rocky Horror Picture Show.</i>

819
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:28,589
Yeah.

820
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:31,194
You think
Uncle Gary is a transvestite, Mum?

821
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:33,555
From Transsexual, Transylvania?

822
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:35,631
- Hey, there's a light.
- Eh? Where?

823
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:37,836
- Over at the Frankenstein place!
- Oh.

824
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:39,717
No. There really is a light.

825
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:41,074
Look.

826
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:47,551
- Wow.
- ALAN: Good Lord!

827
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:50,952
- Oh, my God!
- Blimey.

(LAUGHTER)

829
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:01,555
So, I was... I was 17,
this was in summer 1983

830
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:04,393
and I had five part-time jobs.

831
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:07,711
- And one of them was...
- Five? Why? How?

832
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:09,950
Uh, I don't know, I was saving up
to go to university.

833
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:12,156
- He never went.
- I didn't need to, I hadn't time.

834
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:14,549
- And one of them...
- You didn't hear that.

835
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:15,959
Do you know Luigi's?

836
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:18,713
It's a café on George Square
in the middle of Halifax,

837
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,392
I used to wash up there. Anyway,

838
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,037
there was this old Gaggia machine
in the stockroom upstairs,

839
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:26,839
been there for years gathering dust.
It was defunct, it was ancient.

840
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:28,273
God knows why they never threw it out.

841
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:32,751
But I reckoned I could fix it up
and I footed £5 for it

842
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:34,796
and he laughed and said,

843
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:39,032
"Gary, you take it.
I'll give you £5 to take it away."

844
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:42,354
FELICITY: That's an Italian accent,

845
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:43,759
- in case you were wondering.
- Yeah, I was.

846
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:49,198
So, but at the same time
my granddad, me mum's dad, he retired.

847
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:51,271
He was retiring,
he was a painter and decorator,

848
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:53,476
and he had this old van he'd used
for years and years and years,

849
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:55,118
it was dropping to pieces.

850
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:56,519
And I said, "Can I have it?"

851
00:44:56,600 --> 00:45:00,434
And he said, "Gary, lad, I'll give you
£10 to take it away." So...

852
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:05,797
I've got a coffee machine and a van.

853
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:09,348
What are you going to do? (CHUCKLES)

854
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:10,998
You're going to put them together,
aren't you?

855
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:13,036
- Inevitably. Yeah, obviously.
- GARY: Yeah.

856
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:14,314
FELICITY: That was, in fact, my idea.

857
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:16,914
- GARY: Yeah, well, she says it is.
- Because it's true.

858
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,036
So, where did you two meet?

859
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:22,433
Ah, well, there's another story.

860
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:24,351
Uh, you know Tyson's?

861
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:28,433
The company that makes security alarms
and security equipment?

862
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:30,317
ALAN: Mmm-hmm.

No, not quite, no.
God knows what that'd be worth. No.

866

This is the first edition in America
with, look,

867
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:52,232
the publisher's misattribution
on the title page to Charlotte Brontë.

868
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:56,348
- Isn't that, you know, amazing?
- Amazing.

869
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,879
I am so excited that we've met, Alan.

870
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:07,316
I feel like I need to know everything,
everything about you.

871
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:09,673
And I want you to know
everything about me.

872
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:13,355
Yeah, well, we will, lad, we will.

Well, hello.

How long have you been up?

877
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:58,392
I couldn't get comfortable.
Then I got heartburn again.

878
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:01,392
Then I had to get up to pee
about 19 times.

879
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:03,994
Then I got all excited
thinking about being married to you.

00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:05,559
Aww.

881

Aren't you simple?

00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:13,320
Just think,
in just over three hours' time,

883
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:15,960
we'll be shackled to each other forever.

884
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:17,678
Have you chosen a poem?

885
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:18,749
I might have.

886
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:20,592
Don't want to be the only one
reading out a poem.

887
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:21,954
Might have written one.

888
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:23,439
- Have you?
- Might have.

889
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:24,794
No, have you?

I might wear this suit.

when we got wed first time.

- Right.

- What about you?
- What about me?

Well, what are you wearing?

I'm not going.

when Kate popped round.

Oh, Celia.

- What?

I'm not going to...

923
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:20,430
I'm assuming
you couldn't take her back to your house

924
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:23,478
because Gillian and Eileen
would be there.

925
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:26,199
And who did she live with?
Her mum and dad?

In the back of your car?

930

In the same car, possibly,

back from hospital in

smelling of her.

the night I lost all that blood

and had to have that transfusion,

937

938
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:01,029
he'd been having it off
with someone else.

952
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:00,359
stop hiding?

953
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:03,391
You are magnificent.

954
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:06,235
(VOICE BREAKING) You're very pretty.

955
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:08,709
Do you remember that day?

956
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:10,995
That was so mad,
snogging in your office.

957
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:15,552
It was more than a snog, pal.
I had me hand inside your bra.

958
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:16,675
(TAPPING ON WINDOW)

959
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:20,515
Oh, Alan, it's open.

960
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:26,070
- KATE: Good morning.
- Yes, hello, love.

961
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:27,674
Very smart.

962
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:30,194
Oh, goodness. Well...

963
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:35,797
Oh, we've... I've...
There's a problem with your mum.

964
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:48,031
Mum, you need to get dressed.

965
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:51,198
He's no better than your father.

966
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:52,755
Mum, I want you to get dressed.

967
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:54,713
- Did you hear what I said?
- I did.

968
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:56,313
However, today isn't about that.

969
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:57,989
Look.

970
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:00,679
Please don't take this the wrong way,

971
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:02,796
but you don't mind
if I don't come, do you?

972
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:06,555
Yes. Yes, I do, actually.
I really want you to be there.

973
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:08,551
I'd only make everyone miserable.

974
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:10,392
You'll make me miserable
if you don't come.

975
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:12,756
But Kate's mother's
not going to be there.

976
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:14,717
That's because she is in America.

977
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:17,549
She's working. She's going to come
and spend the summer with us.

978
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:19,471
And all the more reason
why you should be there.

979
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:24,195
(SIGHS) I was fair
looking forward to it.

980
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:26,635
I'd bought an outfit and a hat.

981
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:28,870
Good. Put them on.

982
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:32,309
Oh, Mum.

983
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:36,398
You've got to separate
what's happened between you and Alan

984
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:39,631
from this today
because they're not connected.

985
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:43,628
I really want you to be there, Mum.

986
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:47,670
Mum, get dressed.

987
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:52,831
You'll have a nice day
with your friends.

988
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:57,472
Do you remember when I got my doctorate?

989
00:52:57,560 --> 00:52:59,516
The degree ceremony, you didn't come?

990
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:02,038
My dad turned up and I said,
"Oh, where's Mum?"

991
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:05,271
And he looked a bit apologetic
and he said, "Oh, she's not here."

992
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:08,670
You'd obviously had an argument.
And I was really rude to him, I said,

993
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:12,350
"Well, there's no point
you being here if she's not here."

994
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:15,637
And it really hurt him. I could see.

995
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:18,829
He'd bothered to come all that way
and you hadn't

996
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:20,319
and I was rude to him.

997
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:23,312
The biggest day of my life,
and you weren't there

998
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:25,470
because you'd had an argument with him
about God knows what,

999
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:27,312
but I certainly
wasn't part of the equation

1000
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:29,834
when you decided not to come.

1001
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:36,553
It was always me that took an interest
in everything that you did, not him.

1002
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:40,189
Well, the facts on that occasion
would suggest otherwise.

1003
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:43,113
I had looked forward
to that day so much.

1004
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:46,954
I had imagined it.
I imagined you, both of you, in Oxford.

1005
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:49,952
Taking you out for lunch,
showing you around the college,

1006
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:51,917
introducing you to my friends.

1007
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:54,193
I had no idea you weren't coming

1008
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:56,271
until I saw my dad on his own
down Cornmarket.

1009
00:53:56,360 --> 00:53:59,397
I was devastated. I was gutted.

1010
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:04,077
I know you've had an upset
but these things are not connected.

1011
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:05,752
And if you do this to me again,

1012
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:08,557
then there's absolutely
no point in pretending

1013
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:11,473
that we have any kind of a relationship.

1014
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:17,355
Please, Mum, get dressed.

1015
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:27,792
Right.

1016
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:42,353
Right.

1017
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:02,190
All right? Oh, what is this? Brilliant.

1018
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:03,749
Where's Lawrence?

1019
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:06,479
Uh, I don't know.
I expect he'll come with the others.

1020
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:21,271
Oh, Granny, nice outfit.

1021
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:26,312
She says she's not going.

1022
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:27,919
Why?

1023
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:32,591
I don't want to go, either.

1024
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:34,113
Oh, now, come on.

1025
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:37,112
You can stay here with me
if you like, chicken.

1026
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:39,077
ALAN: Well, I thought you said
you'd invited Angus.

1027
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:41,515
You can't have Angus
turning up on his own.

1028
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:44,637
He'll have no one to sit with.
Eh, eh, and what about your mother?

1029
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:46,952
Are you all right, Gran?

1030
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:50,479
I'm staying here.

1031
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:54,835
You'll regret this.

1032
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:56,911
Both of you, you'll regret it.

1033

What's happened?

1034
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:04,399
Please, please, both of you,
think about Caroline.

1035
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:06,797
She doesn't deserve this.

Oh, uh, Gran and Alan are here.

Shouldn't we all be heading inside?

I'm sorry, love.
I tried to persuade her.

1047
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:06,399
Then, uh, Lawrence came round
and then he wouldn't come, either.

00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:14,074
Well, there's no point
in you being here, then, is there?
