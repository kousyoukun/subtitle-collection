1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:01,550
Guess the latest.

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:04,150
We've decided we're
going to get married.

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,190
Right.

4
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:07,230
'You know my date with Gary?

5
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:08,910
'Wasn't me he was interested in.

6
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,550
'He thinks you had
a fling with his mother.

7
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:15,030
~ 'And that you're his dad.'
~ I didn't know there'd been a child.

8
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:17,430
~ Are you all right?
~ Judith's, erm, she's...

9
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:19,600
She's lost the baby.
It's been awful.

10
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,000
~ I got your text. ~ It's true.

11
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,830
They can't expect you to sell
your house in 28 days!

12
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,990
How else is he going to raise
that kind of money?

13
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:30,790
~ What's up? ~ Nothing.

14
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,430
Someone is going to have
to tell my mother at some point,

15
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,080
and, if none of you do, I will.

16
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,550
He'd like to meet you.

17
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,880
~ Gary? ~ Alan. Hello.

18
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,910
~ It's a bit of a shock. ~ Yes.

19
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,750
For both of us. For all of us.
I mean, Gillian, too.

20
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,160
Yes. Yes.

21
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,640
I didn't sleep much last night.

22
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,320
Yeah...

23
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,640
I didn't want to, erm...

24
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,320
I just...

25
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:59,870
Sorry. I realise I don't actually
have anything to say as such.

26
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,470
It's just, I was intrigued to meet
you. To see you, I suppose.

27
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,030
That's all.

28
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,270
She never told me she was...

29
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,000
Your mum, she never...
Did Gillian tell you?

30
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,550
Gillian's lovely, by the way.

31
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,870
Oh! Well.

32
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,040
So funny. So sweet.
So uncomplicated.

33
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,600
Her heart's in the right place.

34
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:36,510
So, what was he upset for?
I thought he never wanted it.

35
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,310
Well, no. He didn't.

36
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:42,630
I don't know, I've had all this
second-hand from Caroline.

37
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:45,750
Still, I suppose
if it was nearly full-term.

38
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,920
God knows what
she must have gone through.

39
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,470
Are they even together still?
I mean, were they ever,

40
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,590
really actually?
After a certain point?

41
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:58,870
God knows.
She's cleared off, anyway.

42
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:02,270
She's gone to live with her sister
in St Albans.

43
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:05,750
And he's been sleeping
in Caroline's spare room again.

44
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,630
~ Apparently. ~ Really? ~ Hm.

45
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:12,320
She's very good to him, Caroline,
given what a bugger he's been.

46
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,910
If it was me, he'd not darken
the doorstep ever again.

47
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,640
No. No. No.

48
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,150
How...

49
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,150
Can I ask how you met?

50
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:32,790
Erm... Well, I married Eileen,
Gillian's mum in 1957.

51
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:36,550
But the woman
I really wanted to marry,

52
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,630
the woman I was in love with,

53
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:41,720
she'd stood me up.
Except she hadn't.

54
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,350
She left me a message.

55
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,230
Only I never got it.

56
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,630
Celia.

57
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,240
That's right.

58
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:57,390
I was very fond of Eileen.
But, truth is,

59
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,870
I got engaged to her on the rebound.

60
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,070
I don't think we'd have
called it that then,

61
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,630
and I certainly wasn't aware that

62
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,360
that's what I was doing.
But... yeah.

63
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,560
Then I met your mum.

64
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,070
At Jessops Chemicals.
Up Huddersfield.

65
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,680
She was a secretary.
And she reminded me of Celia.

66
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:24,350
The second I saw her,
everything about her,

67
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,110
the way her eyes lit up
when she smiled.

68
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,230
Way she walked.

69
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:34,590
I felt that same feeling I felt
when I was with Celia. It was...

70
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,550
I don't know.

71
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,720
Like... the world lit up.

72
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:47,230
And we were weak, we were daft,
we were old enough to know better,

73
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,080
it shouldn't have happened.

74
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,320
But it did.

75
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,870
Then she left.

76
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,520
And I never saw her again.

77
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,040
Did you TRY to see her again?

78
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,000
No.

79
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,880
I suppose... if I HAD known...

80
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:16,550
.. I'd like to think that
I'd have done the right thing.

81
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:20,870
It would have been more complicated,
obviously.

82
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,390
No, she should have told me.

83
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,390
She should have told me at the time.

84
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:29,960
How ever difficult it might have
been for everybody.

85
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,830
So you're not coming to this...

86
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,830
"wedding" then?

87
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,790
She did ask me.

88
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,590
Only I said we were busy.

89
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,280
And aren't you?

90
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,390
I don't think she really
wanted me there.

91
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,870
I think she only invited me
cos she thought she should.

92
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,150
I think you're being
a bit sensitive.

93
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:59,630
If she didn't want you, she wouldn't
ask you, you know what she's like.

94
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,430
Who else is going?

95
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:05,950
William's coming up from Oxford,
a few people from school,

96
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,190
a couple of her pals from Oxford,

97
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,310
and I don't know
about Kate's family.

98
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:16,720
It's only small, it's all a bit last
minute, not everyone's available.

99
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,720
Our Muriel's in Corfu, sadly.

100
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:25,190
So... John's living at the house.

101
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:28,590
And Kate's on leave now,
so she's at home all day...

102
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,790
with John.

103
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,750
Well, yeah. Presumably.

104
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,030
Cos he's never at work, is he?

105
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,000
I don't know why they pay him.

106
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,030
Contractions are good.

107
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:47,190
They're painful, but
they're on your side.

108
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,270
Your contractions happen
when your uterus contracts,

109
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:54,000
and that's what dilates,
or opens, the cervix.

110
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,550
Now, dads.

111
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,750
During labour,

112
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,830
you may find it distressing to see
your partner in so much pain.

113
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,200
Is this your first, not your first?

114
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:13,670
It's... it's... it's not my first.
It's Kate's first.

115
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:17,790
So you'll know what I'm talking
about. It is distressing,

116
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:22,110
but you just being there, gently
encouraging her to keep going,

117
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,760
that is so important.

118
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:30,080
It's... it's not actually mine,
as such, I'm just...

119
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,480
Kate's my wife's girlfriend.

120
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,350
OK...

121
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,480
So, let's talk about pain relief.

122
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,070
We're back!

123
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,510
Dad!

124
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,230
Ooh, my feet.

125
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,430
~ Calamity, you're getting heavier by
the hour. ~ I'm making you some tea.

126
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,600
Well...

127
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:25,150
.. I think I've spent up, Alan!

128
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:29,550
You'd better not have.
Not if we're thinking about this

129
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,760
Australasian adventure.

130
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:36,430
~ Are we serious? ~ I am if you are.

131
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:39,710
Why are we whispering?
Is it a secret?

132
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,320
No...

133
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:45,110
So, have you been busy?

134
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:48,150
No. No. No.

135
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:52,390
Right, I'll pop all this lot
upstairs, then I can relax.

136
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,430
~ Can you manage? ~ Oh, yes.

137
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,750
Tea? Coffee? Jaeger bomb?

138
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,200
Tea, thanks, love.

139
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,310
Have you had a nice time?

140
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,390
Clothes shopping
with my mother-in-law.

141
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,430
Step-mother.

142
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:12,790
Yeah, yeah.

143
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,520
It was a bit of a laugh.

144
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,030
~ How did you get on? ~ Fine.

145
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:25,390
~ Yeah? ~ Like you said,
he seems like a very nice fella.

146
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,040
Yeah. Yeah.

147
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,790
~ He's odd. ~ What?

148
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,390
~ I felt like I knew him. ~ Yeah.

149
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,590
~ Yeah. ~ So did I.
~ From the moment I saw his face.

150
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:41,110
~ So, what did he say,
what did he want? ~ Nothing.

151
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:44,670
~ I didn't think he did. I think he
just... ~ Just wanted to talk, yeah.

152
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,150
I wish I could've stopped with
him longer, but...

153
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:51,670
Anyhow, he asked me
if we'd like to go have a meal.

154
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:54,150
Meet Felicity. His wife.

155
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,790
Oh, so he is married, then?

156
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,030
Yeah. They've two girls.

157
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:03,400
He meant all of us -
you, me, Raff, Ellie, Calamity.

158
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:07,310
Celia.
He said he'd like to meet Celia.

159
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,230
I said...

160
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,960
"Well, I haven't told her yet."

161
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,270
So...?

162
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,150
Oh, I don't know.

163
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,710
You have got to tell her. I had
Caroline on t'phone

164
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:23,590
a couple of days ago and
she said if we... If you don't tell
Celia, she will.

165
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:27,110
What the hell were you doing
telling Caroline for?

166
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:31,030
I told you! And, look,
she wasn't being nasty.

167
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:34,790
To be fair to her, it's cos
she knows how upset Celia was

168
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,950
when she found out about Kenneth.

169
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,790
Knowing she'd been...

170
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:43,790
cheated on. Lied to.
And isn't it best to be honest?

171
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:47,510
Really? And coming from you sooner
rather than later.

172
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:50,190
I told Caroline you wanted
to meet him first.

173
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,110
And then you'd tell her. Celia.

174
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,550
She was fine with that.

175
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,750
But now you have met him...

176
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,710
So...

177
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,110
OK.

178
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,270
~ So? ~ Yeah, I'll tell her.

179
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,950
~ When? ~ Soon.

180
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,320
Soon!

181
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,190
Well, why did you let him
go with you?

182
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:16,230
Because... I don't know!

183
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,830
He just tagged along and, of course,

184
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,590
I was daft enough to feel
sorry for him.

185
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:22,590
I should've said,
right in front of everyone,

186
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,870
"She's not your wife, she's your
ex-wife John, you're divorced."

187
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,630
~ Yes, you should've done.
~ "She's my wife's girlfriend."

188
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,270
"She's my wife. Very nearly.
And you're..." I don't know.

189
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,790
A friend of the family.

190
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:35,710
Well. No. He's more than that,
he's the father of...

191
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,160
Still...

192
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,830
.. we don't need to split hairs.

193
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:42,750
"I know you've had an upset.
But can I just be blunt?

194
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,030
"You really, really need
to move out, John.

195
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,870
"Before me and Caroline
get married".

196
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,630
Yes, well, good.
You should've said it.

197
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,950
He's got all that money
we've begged, borrowed,

198
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,910
and stolen to buy his half of the
house. What's the problem?

199
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:58,470
I don't think we've stolen
anything, have we?

200
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,720
Whatever.

201
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:03,960
What is the problem? Just say it.

202
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,390
Can't you?

203
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,000
Sure.

204
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,240
~ Yes! ~ Damn.

205
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,640
I'll deal with it later.

206
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,350
I WILL deal with it later.

207
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,960
They're... playing a game.

208
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,910
If I go into labour,
he comes nowhere near that hospital.

209
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,960
Course he won't!

210
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,190
What's the matter?

211
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,320
I don't know.

212
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:56,280
I don't know,
maybe I'm just frightened.

213
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,760
Don't be frightened.

214
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:05,790
I'm not that much younger
than Judith.

215
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,910
Judith's an alcoholic.

216
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,990
What if there's something
wrong with it?

217
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,030
There won't be. Why would there be?

218
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:16,080
And if there is, we'll deal with it.
But there won't be. So.

219
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,200
And you WILL get rid of him?

220
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:24,950
I will ask him...

221
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,760
to leave.

222
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,640
Oh, God. I ought to ring my mum.

223
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,110
Hello?

224
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,830
'Mum, hi. It's me. How are you?'

225
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:57,670
~ Very well, love.
~ 'Good. Good. Good, how's Alan?'

226
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,630
Alan? He's fine.

227
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,670
Caroline says, "How's Alan?"
He's fine, love.

228
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,510
'Good. So, er...'

229
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:10,430
Good. So I've got nothing fresh
that I can think of. Have you?

230
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,950
'No... I don't think so.'

231
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,910
~ Have we got anything fresh, Alan?
~ No. No. No

232
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,790
(He's not told her.)

233
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:20,070
'We thought we'd drive over'

234
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:23,470
on Friday,
the day before the wedding,

235
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:27,310
'then if there's anything
you want doing, I can help out.'

236
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,750
Right. Good. Thank you.

237
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,120
Is that Ellie?

238
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,830
~ Did you decide on your outfit?
~ Hello, love.

239
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,470
~ Where've you been?
~ Supermarket. Greenhough's.

240
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,710
~ Not answering your phone.
~ Oh, have ya been ringing?

241
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,150
~ Oggy said you had an argument
with Mr Epplewhite. ~ I did.

242
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,830
~ Which one's he?
~ Politics.

243
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:48,110
I told him he can shove his course
work up his arse,

244
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,950
and I've left,
and I've got a job at Greenhough's.

245
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,760
You can't do that!

246
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,080
Well, I just did.

247
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,750
You can't NOT do your A-levels.

248
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,390
What's happened?

249
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,350
Well, no, I can. Not do them.

250
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,750
And then I can earn some money.

251
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,390
Have you spoken... Have you talked
to your mum about it?

252
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,990
No way, she's enough on worrying
about me grandad.

253
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,510
~ Right, well, I think you need to.
~ It's none of her business.

254
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,910
No, Ellie, it is!
She's going to be very upset

255
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:15,470
if you're going to drop
out of doing your A-levels.

256
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,270
You can't work at Greenhough's.

257
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,870
~ That's just a job, it's not a
career. ~ You're a clever lass!

258
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,430
You don't want to just go
chucking it all down the drain.

259
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,590
No, listen, it's good!
It's full-time!

260
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,390
He said I can go on a fast-track,

261
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:31,390
he said I can be a store manager
in a couple of years

262
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,390
if I put the hours in and play my
cards right,

263
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,230
~ there's all sorts of opportunities.
~ Wow(!)

264
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,190
It's money, Raff.

265
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,310
It's not being
dependent on every-bloody-body.

266
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,510
It isn't like I've got that many
people to be dependent on now

267
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,150
with me Grandad being such a loony!

268
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,910
I still think you need to
ring your mother!

269
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:53,590
Hang on,
I can't hear what you're saying,

270
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:56,750
they're all just shouting
at each other at this end.

271
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,670
Can I speak to Gillian?

272
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,440
Erm...
Yeah, I think so, hang on. Gillian!

273
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,080
It's Caroline.

274
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,150
What's happened? What's going on...?

275
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,670
Hiya, Caz.

276
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,390
He hasn't told her.

277
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,870
No, no, no, not yet.

278
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,560
'He needs to tell her.'

279
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,430
I know. He will.

280
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,590
He needs to tell her soon.

281
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:24,990
Yes. I know, I agree with you,
I'm working on it.

282
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,750
I do like Kate, you know.

283
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:40,240
I suppose if Caroline had to be that
way, she could've done a lot worse.

284
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,470
It's funny, isn't it? Babies.

285
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,950
They're always welcome
when they come.

286
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,710
Even when they're unexpected.

287
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,960
Like our little Calamity.

288
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,440
And now there's this other one.

289
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,590
I know there's something
bothering you.

290
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,280
I wish you'd let on what it is.

291
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:11,070
Is it Harry and that damned silly
mess he's got himself into?

292
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,120
Well, what, then?

293
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:19,960
I've had a bit of news.

294
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,480
What news?

295
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,840
I've been in two minds about
whether to tell you or not.

296
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:38,360
~ What news?
~ It's not, I'm not ill, I...

297
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:44,630
I suppose there's a lot about
each other we still don't know,

298
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,070
isn't there?

299
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,350
Is there?

300
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:51,070
Well, 60-odd years
not seeing someone,

301
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:54,320
there's bound to be one or two...

302
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,360
What? One or two what?

303
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:05,280
It turns out I've got
a skeleton in the cupboard.

304
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,200
What do you mean?

305
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:13,200
One I never even knew I had.

306
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,440
Well, not...

307
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:20,430
What? What is it?

308
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,230
Oh, I don't care what it is, Alan.

309
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,510
You can tell me anything.

310
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:29,030
Nothing's worth making yourself
ill over, just tell me.

311
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:31,880
Just say it, just spit it out.

312
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,590
You'll think I'm like Kenneth.

313
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:40,120
How could you ever be like Kenneth?

314
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,680
I've got a lad.

315
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,000
A son.

316
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,310
A boy I never knew I had.

317
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,080
Well, I call him "lad."
He's a man now.

318
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,270
You see...

319
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,040
I had a bit of a fling.

320
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,350
When?

321
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,720
Years ago.

322
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,880
Before you were married?

323
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,840
No.

324
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:19,950
So, I don't want to make excuses.
It happened. It shouldn't have.

325
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,960
But I didn't know
there'd been a child.

326
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,600
When?

327
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:34,470
Year our Gillian were born.
Only as I say, I've only just...

328
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,840
The year Gillian were born?

329
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:43,960
But you'd been married nine years
when Gillian... was born.

330
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,910
Who was she?

331
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,760
You wouldn't know her.

332
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,840
They lived up Siddal.

333
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,710
Mary.

334
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:03,120
She were called Mary. Mary Kershaw.

335
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:09,000
Came to work at Jessops.
She were the secretary.

336
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:13,830
She, um...

337
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,720
She had the look of you.

338
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,760
The year Gillian was born,
you were...?

339
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,910
Did Eileen know?

340
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:33,350
No. It's like I'd said to Gillian,
it stopped before it started.

341
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:38,070
~ It was never...
~ So what does Gillian know about it?

342
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:40,840
Her date. On Valentine's Day.

343
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,030
It weren't a date as such.

344
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,600
It were him.

345
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,150
How long did it go on?

346
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,910
It didn't.

347
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,910
Long enough to get her pregnant.

348
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,440
Only the once.

349
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:03,000
Then she left. I never saw her again.

350
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,920
I had no idea she were...

351
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,070
So, what does he want, this Gary?

352
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,830
Nothing. He just wanted to meet me.

353
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,520
And are you going to?

354
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,350
Well, the thing is...

355
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,990
I already have.

356
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:27,910
I met him this morning when
you and Gillian went shopping.

357
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:31,030
And he's a grand fella, Celia.

358
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:34,030
And he's very keen to meet you.
Genuinely.

359
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:37,510
He's the sort of person
who genuinely seems to be

360
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:41,230
~ interested in people. He...
~ So, hang on.

361
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:44,870
He just rang out of the blue,
this morning,

362
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:47,190
when Gillian and me
just happened to be out shopping?

363
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:52,230
No. No. No, he, we, it were...
It were arranged.

364
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:54,390
Gillian arranged it.

365
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:57,550
Oh, so you were just getting me
out of the way?

366
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,920
No!

367
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,790
Look...

368
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,190
~ It were delicate... ~ Where?

369
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,920
Where did you meet him?

370
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:08,590
~ In a cafe. ~ Right.

371
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,950
I understand you'd probably rather
I'd told you first...

372
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,630
I'd rather you didn't lie to me
about what you were doing.

373
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:18,870
But, obviously, I were worried
about how you'd react.

374
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:23,680
You see, this is what adultery does
to people, it turns them into liars.

375
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,870
Well, no wonder you couldn't
have little Calamity,

376
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:31,070
no wonder we had to trail
her round with us.

377
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,350
It's been difficult,
knowing the right thing to do

378
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,750
and the right order to do stuff in.

379
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:38,510
And of course Gillian's been upset.

380
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:43,110
But not above colluding
with you about deceiving me.

381
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,070
Nobody wanted to deceive you!

382
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,360
It was just about knowing when
and how to tell you.

383
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,070
Well...

384
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,560
You've told me now.

385
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,160
Have you seen Ellie?

386
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:08,950
Yeah, she were up at 6:15,
she was off to catch the 6:50 bus.

387
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,470
She's to be at Greenhough's
at half past.

388
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:15,710
She didn't discuss this wi' me
at all, nothing.

389
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:19,030
~ You need to be communicating
with each other more. ~ No shit!

390
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:21,550
I'm not being an unpaid nanny
if she's out earning money.

391
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,390
That is not the way the world works,
this isn't cloud cuckoo land.

392
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,430
Also, plus, Yvonne is slinging me

393
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:30,430
cash every week for her
housekeeping. Which...

394
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,230
I can't accept that. I'm not
accepting that if Ellie's working.

395
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:37,950
~ Did she even speak to her mother
last night? ~ No idea.

396
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,910
Do you just not talk to each other
at all? About anything?

397
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,190
Hello?!

398
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:45,510
~ Right, well, I'll have to bang on
about it at her, then! ~ Feel free!

399
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,310
I'll see her later. I'm on a shift!

400
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:51,000
After I've done every bloody thing
else for every bugger else!

401
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,760
What's up with Celia
and me grandad?

402
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,950
What IS up with Celia
and your grandad?

403
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,430
They're sat at breakfast table
not speaking to each other.

404
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,430
Has something happened?

405
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,590
~ They were up in t'night,
I heard 'em. ~ No, I don't think...

406
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:16,200
Is one of 'em ill?

407
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:20,310
No. No. Nothing like that.

408
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,400
Just...

409
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:28,200
It turns out I've got a brother.

410
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,870
A half brother...

411
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,710
that I didn't know about.

412
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:35,920
How?

413
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,320
You what?!

414
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,640
I would like you to meet him.

415
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,680
You see, I think you'd like him.

416
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,640
He'd like to meet you.

417
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:06,000
I can't imagine why.

418
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,270
He's very... I don't know.

419
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,870
Calm.

420
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:16,030
His manner. Kindly and...

421
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:19,710
unusual. I was nervous about going to
meet him. But, no,

422
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:22,830
he just seemed to be wanting
to make sense of it himself,

423
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:28,240
and apologising, and saying that he
knew it was a shock for all of us.

424
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:34,270
He were being very grown-up
about the whole thing, I suppose.

425
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:37,040
And you want me
to be grown-up about it, too?

426
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,080
Well?

427
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:44,830
Either we can move forward together,
or...

428
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,680
I don't know what
the alternative is.

429
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:54,480
Maybe I should go and stay
with Caroline for a few days.

430
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,680
Caroline knows, by the way.

431
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,550
Caroline? What the hell
does Caroline know about it?

432
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,390
Gillian wanted to talk to her

433
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,840
before she told me,
after she met him. Gary.

434
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:14,560
Anyway, she thought Caroline'd know
the best way forward.

435
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:20,150
So Kate'll know about it as well,
won't she?

436
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:24,880
~ I mean, does everybody know
except me? ~ No. No!

437
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:31,670
Well, of course I discussed it with
Kate, I'm allowed to,

438
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:34,880
she's my partner.
We tell each other things.

439
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:40,230
You see, this is what
I used to hate about your dad.

440
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:43,390
Him mucking about
and everybody knowing.

441
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:48,550
Then you find out and you realise
they've been laughing at you
behind your back.

442
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,310
Or else feeling sorry for you.

443
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,390
All who?

444
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:55,430
'Oh... Everybody, anybody,'

445
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,750
I don't know. You lot.

446
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:00,640
Not in this instance,
nobody's like that.

447
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,560
I'm so shocked, Caroline.

448
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,280
I thought he was different.

449
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,920
I thought I knew him.

450
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:15,390
I thought he was better than that.

451
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:19,030
You know, when you haven't seen
someone for 60 years,

452
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:21,640
there will be things about them
you don't know.

453
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:25,150
I love you.

454
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,470
I love you too.

455
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,910
And I think he does,
I know he does, and you know,

456
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,510
'this isn't about you,
and I think you need to try

457
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,350
'and step back from it.'

458
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:39,550
He went and met him
without telling me.

459
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,030
'Yeah.'

460
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,190
Yeah...

461
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,550
Did you know that?

462
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,590
'Yeah. Yeah. I...'

463
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,910
Yeah.

464
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:50,750
~ Why didn't you tell me? ~ 'I was
going to! I told Gillian, I said'

465
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:53,280
"If you don't hurry up
and tell her, I will."

466
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:57,030
Are all men rotten?

467
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:58,600
No. No.

468
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:02,790
A lot of them are, but I don't
think Alan's one of them.

469
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:06,030
If I thought he was I'd have driven
straight over there two days ago and

470
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:09,630
ripped his pacemaker out
and shoved it...

471
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,320
where the sun doesn't shine.

472
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:15,790
He hasn't got a pacemaker.

473
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:19,070
'No, I know, I know. I just...'

474
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,310
I thought it sounded good.
But I would.

475
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:24,110
'If I thought for one second that he
was taking the mickey

476
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,590
'out of you, I'd deal with him.'

477
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:28,150
I don't think he is.
I think he's a good man.

478
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:31,470
I think he's made a mistake and
I bet he's doing his damnedest now

479
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:35,270
to make things right, because I
would imagine that he is terrified.

480
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:40,030
~ 'Terrified of losing you.'
~ You're very wise.

481
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,950
'Hm...'

482
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,720
I wonder who I get that from?

483
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,870
Not me.

484
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:51,510
You're right to be upset.
He was unfaithful to his wife.

485
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:54,750
That's something that's going to
bring back a lot of unpleasant

486
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,990
memories for you,
but it was a long time ago.

487
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:59,670
'That's not an excuse,
but it really

488
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:02,480
'isn't a reflection
on you personally, is it?

489
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,200
'Can you see that?'

490
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:09,470
I know you're shocked, I know you're
upset, and come over here for

491
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:12,710
a few days on your own if you want
a bit of time to yourself but...

492
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:16,680
you don't really want to lose Alan,
Mum, do you?

493
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,880
Have I buggered everything up?

494
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,470
You've been a while.

495
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:57,200
I went for a little drive
onto the tops.

496
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:01,030
We were worried you
weren't coming back.

497
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,590
I rang Caroline.

498
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,070
Is she all right?

499
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:07,350
Mmm. Kate's sick of John
being around the house all day.

500
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:10,670
But Lawrence likes him being there,
so she's finding it difficult

501
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:15,000
to tell him to sling his hook.
But, no, nothing else fresh.

502
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:23,230
I really don't want to be
small-minded about this.

503
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:28,670
I'm not Kenneth, Celia.
It happened once.

504
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,310
I were ashamed of it, I regretted it,

505
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,520
and it never happened again.

506
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,920
OK.

507
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:39,400
I'd almost forgotten it'd happened.

508
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:46,040
Happen I blacked it out,
I don't know.

509
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,480
Right.

510
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,790
Are we friends?

511
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,560
Course we're friends.

512
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:01,590
I googled him.

513
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:04,350
~ Sorry? ~ Gary! I googled him.

514
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:07,990
You know I said it looked like
he'd done all right for himself?

515
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:11,110
Well, he has. He's owns Cafe Rapido.

516
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:14,990
Mobile coffee shops, mobile baristas.

517
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:17,950
Vans selling coffee,
and pastries, and cakes,

518
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,190
like at railways stations
and football matches,

519
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,790
and, well, you'll have
seen 'em around.

520
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:27,400
~ I've never been to a football match.
~ They're all over!

521
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:31,790
He started off with one van
when he were 18,

522
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:35,790
and now he has whole fleets of 'em,
up and down the country.

523
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:39,870
He's an entrepreneur,
he's a multi-millionaire.

524
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:45,550
~ Is he? ~ He supports all sorts of
charities and good causes.

525
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:48,830
He owns
Huddersfield Town Football club!

526
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,630
Do you want to have a look?

527
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:55,200
Let me see
if I can find it again for you.

528
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,510
You and me need to be having

529
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:15,560
a proper conversation
at some point, lady.

530
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:19,470
~ Gillian! ~ Cheryl.

531
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:22,070
~ How's yourself?
~ Yeah... I'm all right.

532
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:24,630
Bless. I've heard the news.

533
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,190
Which?

534
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,750
That you and Robbie's been
at it behind my back.

535
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,870
Anything you'd like to say to me?

536
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,350
I, er...

537
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,870
You don't know
what I'm talking about?

538
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:37,470
No, I'm sorry,
that's not going to wash.

539
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,830
It were Robbie
that telled me hisself.

540
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:42,950
Bit of a domestic about the kitchen.
Him not wanting to spend money,

541
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,030
and me saying, "Well, this is just a
breeding ground for bacteria,"

542
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,710
then one thing led to another
and it all came tumbling out.

543
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:51,710
So, what I'd like to suggest is,

544
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:54,830
next time you're making whoopee,
if you could just ask him

545
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:57,870
to wear one of these cos, obviously,

546
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:01,470
I personally don't want to be
picking up anything unpleasant.

547
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:05,190
Oh, as well, if you're so desperate
for sex that you need to borrow

548
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:08,160
other people's fellas,
let me give you this.

549
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:13,670
Yep, so...

550
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,790
there we go.

551
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:18,320
Have a nice day. Mind how you go.

552
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:24,630
Careful now, don't get too close,
or she'll have your kecks off.

553
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:27,270
I know, and with
a face like a bust shoe.

554
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:30,070
She must be releasing the right
sort of pheromones, eh?

555
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,760
Oh, I like your shoes!

556
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:03,710
So I said "Fine.

557
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:07,870
"You can shove your job where
monkeys shove their nuts."

558
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:11,310
~ I've had enough being talked to
like crap. ~ Well... what happened?

559
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:13,150
Nothing.

560
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:15,830
Just... him saying how I'm always
trouble.

561
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,750
Me! I know.

562
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,070
Always late.

563
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:22,310
Really? Twice in the last...

564
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:25,790
month.
Always mouthing off, apparently.

565
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:30,270
Only because I'm sticking up
for people, other people,

566
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:33,510
against him being
a fascist dictator.

567
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:37,990
I said, I told him,
"My father was a union man.

568
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:40,190
"I'm not apologising."

569
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:43,150
Then him just going on about
how I'm always...

570
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:48,270
Whatever, so I just said
"Fine. Fine. You know what?

571
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:51,910
"Fine. For me, this is win-win."

572
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,680
So you lost your job.

573
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:57,830
No, I... I resigned.

574
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,640
How is it win-win?

575
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:04,870
I get time off and I don't have to
listen to that jackass

576
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,670
telling me what to do any more.

577
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,440
Oh, you pillock.

578
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,830
Where's Celia?

579
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,990
Oh. She was here
before I nodded off.

580
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:20,350
Is the Lexus outside?

581
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,270
Yeah.

582
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,150
Celia?!

583
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,440
I'm just upstairs!

584
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:30,280
~ Did you tell her? ~ Yeah.

585
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:35,280
~ Yeah. And? ~ She's fine.

586
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,790
Fine how?

587
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:42,790
Obviously, it were a shock
to start with. But, I don't know,

588
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:45,920
Caroline seemed to talk some
sense into her.

589
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:51,240
Yeah, and,
come and have a look at this.

590
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:56,910
I googled him.
Do you realise who he is?

591
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:01,350
You'll not believe it.
He's a real mover and a shaker.

592
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:04,270
You'll not credit
what he's achieved.

593
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,720
~ Blimey. ~ Yeah.

594
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,870
God!

595
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,710
~ Huddersfield Town? ~ He owns it.

596
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:15,310
Maybe he'll give me a job,
cutting the Astroturf.

597
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:18,390
Well, ask him. I rang him,
we're all going to tea on Friday.

598
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:22,150
~ Tea? ~ Supper. Dinner. A meal.

599
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:24,040
Seven for seven-thirty.

600
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:29,390
~ I'll have to tell Raff. ~ Yeah, I...

601
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,390
Already told him.

602
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,110
He heard you get up in the night,

603
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:36,950
~ and he was worried you were ill,
so I... ~ How did he...?

604
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:41,310
Oh, he thought it was "well cool"
I think were the exact words.

605
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:44,350
The fact that you'd been unfaithful
to my mother appeared to go

606
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,550
right over his pretty little head.

607
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:49,950
But then again he's a bloke, so...

608
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,590
What you doing?

609
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:53,830
I'm going to Harrogate. Hello, love.

610
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:56,430
~ Celia. ~ I don't want to make a fuss.

611
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:00,110
I'm happy for you to go and have
dinner with this Gary.

612
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:03,150
I can see you're all excited about
it and I understand why,

613
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,910
he's obviously a very
successful young man,

614
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:08,710
but I personally would
find it difficult. So...

615
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:11,470
If it's all right with everyone
here, I'd rather be in Harrogate.

616
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:15,510
Celia, it's not because he's
successful, it's because he's,

617
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:17,430
well, he's flesh and blood.

618
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:20,270
Yes, well, whatever it is,
he'll understand...

619
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,710
He was particular in
wanting to meet you.

620
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,430
It's you he's interested in.

621
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,790
And that's fine. Like I say,
I don't want to be

622
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:30,830
small minded about it. But, equally,
you'll understand

623
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,750
if I don't want to be there.

624
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:36,910
And, anyway, it's the wedding
the next day and she might want me

625
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:40,470
over there Friday night in case
there's anything wants doing.

626
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:43,160
OK, I won't go.

627
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,990
No. You're going,
I'm not having that.

628
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,000
You're going.

629
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:06,270
I thought I might cook
this evening for everyone

630
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:09,120
as a sort of thank you.
I bought steak.

631
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,790
You're not a vegetarian, are you?

632
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:15,430
No. I can't do nuts,
but other than that...

633
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:16,920
I bought this.

634
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,120
Sweet, isn't it?

635
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,750
I always wanted a girl.

636
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,950
I mean, I love the boys, obviously,

637
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:31,790
I wouldn't swap them. But, secretly,
I always wanted a little girl, too.

638
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:35,080
But Caroline didn't want to have
any more after the boys came along.

639
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,830
I'm really sorry about
what's happened, John.

640
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,350
Yes.

641
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,760
I know you are.

642
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,120
You've both been very kind.

643
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:55,160
Do you want some tea?

644
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,790
Oh, yeah, Mum.

645
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:15,270
What's this about you
and a vibrator and some condoms?

646
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,710
I said not to say owt!

647
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:19,350
So actually you got sacked, in fact.

648
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,790
~ I resigned. ~ She resigned.

649
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,790
~ What happened? ~ Nothing.

650
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:25,950
~ Cheryl came in the shop. Apparently.
~ I wouldn't have told you about it

651
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,910
if I thought you were going to
be horrible!

652
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:30,550
And repeat it in front
of your grandad!

653
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:32,950
~ I'll go. ~ What happened?

654
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,510
I wouldn't have, Gillian.

655
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,070
What happened?

656
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:40,510
There was an incident at work
involving Cheryl.

657
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:47,150
Who clearly has some form
of borderline personality disorder

658
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:51,150
and who got the wrong
end of the stick. Yet again!

659
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,990
So, what happened?

660
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,750
I can't turn it off.

661
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:07,280
~ Carry on! ~ Perhaps we should have
a chat, Gillian? In my office.

662
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:10,640
~ Are you all right?
~ Yeah, I'm fine.

663
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:17,110
So, he said it was a final warning,
and I resigned.

664
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:19,990
NO, hang on. Why would Cheryl
do something like that?

665
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:22,960
~ Because she's deranged. ~ And she's
thick. Not that she can help it.

666
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:27,110
I heard about what happened
and I just wanted to say sorry.

667
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:30,720
I should've er... I should've warned
you that she, er...

668
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,800
.. that she...

669
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:38,790
Anyway, she's moved out, she's gone.

670
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,150
Why?

671
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,870
Er...

672
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:44,110
Oh...

673
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,240
You've...

674
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,990
Don't you ever, EVER pull that face
at me again, young man.

675
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,870
~ Why? What has...? Oh.
~ I did tell you.

676
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,750
~ Yeah. ~ You told HIM? When?

677
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:01,830
We've been invited out for tea
to Gary's.

678
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:03,390
Gary? Oh...

679
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,190
So...

680
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:07,160
OK. Blimey.

681
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:11,430
~ So she's moved out? ~ Yup.

682
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:13,240
We need to be setting off.

683
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:19,400
~ Sorry. OK. Well, look I'll...
catch up with you later. ~ Yeah.

684
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,920
'So, they're going.'

685
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:32,470
He's fair smitten with him.

686
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:35,470
He said he felt like he knew him
when he met him.

687
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,430
Soon as he clapped eyes on him,

688
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:40,070
he said he felt like
he'd "always known him."

689
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:42,750
Which, I mean how can you?

690
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,590
It's Gillian I feel sorry for.

691
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:48,790
Losing her job and then Alan
all excited about this fella

692
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,950
being a multi-millionaire.

693
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,670
Obviously, it's complicated for...

694
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:56,990
She's obviously got very mixed
feelings about him herself,

695
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:00,030
but, oh, no, Alan's blind to it.

696
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:04,110
On the one hand, he's saying
he's ashamed he ever had this...

697
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:07,230
relationship, and, on the other,
he seems to think

698
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:10,280
this fella's the best thing
since sliced bread.

699
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:24,150
Talk about the pot
calling the kettle black.

700
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:26,430
~ Eh? ~ Oh, no... ~ Oh, yes!

701
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:28,110
All these years.

702
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:31,710
Listen, and I wasn't the other
woman. She was.

703
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:34,270
Me and Robbie, we just had
a bit of a blip, that's all,

704
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:38,230
cos of that loud-mouthed, alcoholic
bitch sticking her neb in.

705
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:39,430
Which?

706
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:42,910
~ Judith. ~ We're not going to parade
all this in front of Gary, are we?

707
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,910
What, all our dirty linen?!

708
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,390
Oh, hell, no.

709
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:49,430
We don't want him
thinking any of us have sex, do we?

710
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:51,230
Eh, Grandad?

711
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:01,750
~ Where the hell are we? ~ We're lost.

712
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:05,070
~ I think it looks dead creepy.
~ So do I.

713
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:09,190
~ God, this is dank. ~ I'm wondering
if that was a wrong turn.

714
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:13,190
That first one we took way back
when we came off main road.

715
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:14,720
Oh, now he says it!

716
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:18,670
Shit. What was that?

717
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,990
Oh, we're all right. Keep going.

718
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:23,870
The worst thing that can happen
is we'll end up in Slaithwaite.

719
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:27,230
~ It's like we're in The Rocky Horror
Picture Show. ~ Yeah.

720
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:29,670
Do you think Uncle Gary's
a transvestite, Mum?

721
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:32,390
From Transsexual Transylvania?

722
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:34,310
~ Hey, there's a light.
~ Eh? Where?

723
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:39,080
~ Over at the Frankenstein place. ~ No.
~ No, there really is a light, look.

724
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:44,190
Wow.

725
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:46,350
Look. Good lord.

726
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,470
Oh, my God.

727
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:50,000
Blimey.

728
00:43:56,240 --> 00:44:00,030
I was 17, this was in summer 1983

729
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:03,110
and I had FIVE part-time jobs.

730
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:05,750
~ And one of them was in... ~ Five? Why?

731
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:08,750
~ How? ~ I don't know, I was saving up
to go to university.

732
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:13,150
~ He never went. ~ I didn't need to,
hadn't time, and one of them...
~ You didn't hear that.

733
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:14,750
Do you know Luigi's?

734
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:17,550
Cafe on George Square
in the middle of Halifax,

735
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:19,710
~ I used to wash up there.
~ Thank you. ~ Anyway,

736
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:22,670
there was this old Gaggia
machine in the stock room upstairs,

737
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:25,590
been there for years gathering dust,
it was defunct, it was ancient,

738
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:29,390
God knows why he never threw it out,
but I reckoned I could fix it up

739
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:31,430
and I offered him £5 for it,

740
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:33,310
and he laughed and said,

741
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:37,950
"Gary, you take it, I give
you £5 to take it away".

742
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:42,590
~ That's an Italian accent if you
were... ~ Yeah. ~ .. wondering.

743
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:46,870
So, but, at the same time,
my grandad, my mum's dad,

744
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:49,990
he retired, he was retiring,
he was a painter and decorator

745
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:52,430
and he had this old van he'd
used for years and years,

746
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:55,310
it was dropping to pieces
and I said, "Can I have it?"

747
00:44:55,360 --> 00:45:00,470
And he said, "Gary lad, I'll give
you £10 to take it away". So...

748
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:05,190
I've got a coffee machine and a van.

749
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:07,310
What are you going to do?

750
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:11,790
~ You're going to put them together,
aren't you? ~ Inevitably. Obviously.

751
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:14,510
~ That was, in fact, my idea.
~ Well, she says this.

752
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:15,870
Because it's true.

753
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:18,070
So, where did you two meet?

754
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:20,990
Ah, well, there's another story.

755
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:24,910
You know Tyson's, the company
that makes security alarms

756
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:27,510
and security equipment
down in Sowerby Bridge?

757
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:29,350
Well...

758
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:34,630
Know what I mean?

759
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:38,750
Now... And this is a first edition?

760
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:42,270
No, not quite, no. God knows what
that would be worth, no.

761
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:46,750
This is the first edition in
America, with, look...

762
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:50,830
The publisher's misattribution on
the title page to Charlotte Bronte.

763
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:52,710
Isn't that, you know...

764
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:55,190
~ .. amazing? ~ Amazing.

765
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:02,430
I'm SO excited that we've met, Alan.

766
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:06,430
I feel like I need to know
everything, everything about you,

767
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:10,230
~ and I want you to know
everything about me. ~ Yeah, well...

768
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:12,600
.. we will, lad. We will.

769
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:47,760
Good morning.

770
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:50,710
Oh, hello.

771
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:52,750
How long have you been up?

772
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:55,310
I couldn't get comfortable.

773
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:57,110
Then I got heartburn, again.

774
00:46:57,160 --> 00:46:59,910
Then I had to get up to
pee, about 19 times.

775
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:02,870
And then I got all excited,
thinking about being married to you.

776
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:04,200
Aww.

777
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:09,270
Aren't you simple?

778
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:10,310
Just think,

779
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:14,630
in just over three hours' time we'll
be shackled to each other forever.

780
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:16,190
Have you chosen a poem?

781
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:17,510
I might have.

782
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:19,590
I don't want to be the only one
reading out a poem.

783
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:22,190
~ I might have written one.
~ Have you? ~ Might have.

784
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:23,360
No, have you?

785
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:26,830
My love is like a hot water bottle.

786
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:28,430
That's so flattering, Caroline.

787
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:30,190
My love is like a thermal vest.

788
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:32,510
God, you've really
missed your metier, haven't you?

789
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:35,040
Shall I compare thee
to my Jeep Cherokee?

790
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:37,280
Go on, then.

791
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:39,960
Thou art more...

792
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:42,520
More...?

793
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:47,190
Built like a tank and guzzles diesel
like it's going out of fashion?

794
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:50,030
Yeah, OK. I've not thought
that one through.

795
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:52,160
Yeah, well, you've got three hours.

796
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:54,800
Caroline.

797
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:58,040
Caroline?

798
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:23,670
Eh, I'm thinking
I might wear this suit.

799
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:26,310
It's the one I wore
when we got wed first time

800
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:29,670
~ in register office in Halifax.
~ Right.

801
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:32,110
What about you?

802
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:33,390
What about me?

803
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:34,990
Well, what are you wearing?

804
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:37,270
I'm not going.

805
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:38,950
What do you mean?

806
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,070
I can't stand there, smiling.

807
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:44,470
Nobody's going to thank me
if I stand there looking like
a wet weekend.

808
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:46,670
Well, I think you should make
an effort.

809
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:49,670
~ It's Caroline's big day...
~ Big day?

810
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:52,990
~ Getting married to another woman?
~ But...

811
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:58,230
You were just saying how nice it were
when Kate popped round.

812
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:00,360
Yeah, well, that was yesterday.

813
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:03,520
Oh, Celia...

814
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:07,960
Don't let this other
business spoil...

815
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:12,510
~ Where did you do it?
~ What?

816
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:15,550
Sex. You and Mary?

817
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:16,870
I'm not going there...

818
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:19,270
I'm assuming you couldn't take her
back to your house,

819
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:22,310
because Gillian
and Eileen would be there.

820
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:24,910
And who did she live with?
Her mum and dad,

821
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:27,670
~ so that wouldn't have been
an option. ~ I don't want...

822
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:30,310
In a stationery cupboard at Jessops?

823
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:31,790
In the back of your car?

824
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:34,110
Fumbling about with her knickers.

825
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:35,550
In the same car, possibly,

826
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:39,560
that you'd brought Gillian back from
the hospital in when she was born.

827
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:43,230
Then going back to Eileen...

828
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:45,160
.. smelling of HER.

829
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:48,480
I'm not Kenneth.

830
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:51,430
The night Caroline was born,

831
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:56,230
the night I lost all that blood
and I had to have that transfusion.

832
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:59,590
I found out afterwards he'd been
having it off with someone else.

833
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:01,840
Kenneth, that same night.

834
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:06,030
I was in hospital, I nearly died,

835
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:08,920
and he was off,
shagging one of his tarts.

836
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:12,750
Do you know what that does to you?

837
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:16,000
To your self-esteem?
Have you any idea?

838
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:20,240
And the year Gillian was born...

839
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:24,920
.. you're mucking about
with somebody's secretary.

840
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:35,880
~ Ten minutes, then we'd better...
~ Yeah.

841
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:40,470
You nervous?

842
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:41,600
Are you?

843
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:47,520
~ Can I tell you something?
~ What?

844
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:52,910
Can I tell you how grateful
I am to you, for...

845
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:55,640
.. giving me the strength
and the courage to...

846
00:50:57,640 --> 00:50:58,680
.. stop hiding.

847
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:01,880
You're magnificent.

848
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:05,910
You're very pretty.

849
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:07,350
Do you remember that day?

850
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:09,830
That was so mad!
Snogging in your office.

851
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:14,350
It was more than a snog, pal.
I had my hand inside your bra.

852
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:19,280
Alan. It's open!

853
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:25,150
~ Good morning! ~ Yes. Hello, love.

854
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:26,350
Very smart!

855
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:28,840
Oh, yes. Well...

856
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:31,720
We've, I've...

857
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:35,520
There's a problem with your mum.

858
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:47,510
Mum, you need to get dressed.

859
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:50,150
He's no better than your father.

860
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:53,110
~ Mum, I want you to get dressed.
~ Did you hear what I said?

861
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:56,160
~ I did. However,
today isn't about that. ~ Look...

862
00:51:57,800 --> 00:51:59,470
.. please don't take this
the wrong way,

863
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:02,110
~ but you don't mind
if I don't come, do you? ~ Yes.

864
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:04,990
Yes, I do, actually.
I really want you to be there.

865
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:07,110
I'd only make everyone miserable.

866
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:09,390
You'll make ME miserable
if you don't come.

867
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:11,710
But Kate's mother's not going
to be there.

868
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:13,750
That's because she's in America.

869
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:16,470
She's working, she's going to come
and spend the summer with us,

870
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:18,400
all the more reason
why you SHOULD be there.

871
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:24,590
I was fair looking forward to it.
I'd bought an outfit.

872
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:27,200
~ And a hat.
~ Good, put them on.

873
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:32,950
Oh, Mum.

874
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,110
You've got to separate
what's between you and Alan

875
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:36,670
from this, today.

876
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:38,600
Because they're not connected.

877
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:42,560
I really want you to be there,
Mum.

878
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:46,800
Mum. Get dressed.

879
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:51,520
You'll have a nice day
with your friends.

880
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:57,430
Do you remember when I got
my doctorate? The degree ceremony.

881
00:52:57,480 --> 00:53:00,830
And you didn't come. My dad turned
up, and I said, "Where's mum?",

882
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:04,030
and he looked a bit apologetic
and he said, "Oh she's not here".

883
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:05,510
You'd obviously had an argument.

884
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:08,470
And I was really rude to him.
I said...

885
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:10,990
"Well there's no point you being
here if she's not here".

886
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:14,750
And it really hurt him, I could see.

887
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:17,750
He'd bothered to come all that way
and you hadn't,

888
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:20,310
and I was rude to him. It was the
biggest day of my life

889
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:23,030
and you weren't there cos you'd had
an argument with him

890
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:24,830
about God knows what, but I
certainly

891
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:26,230
wasn't part of the
equation

892
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:28,680
when you decided not to come.

893
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:34,470
It was always me that took
an interest in everything you did,

894
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:35,590
not him.

895
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:39,070
The facts on that occasion would
suggest otherwise.

896
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:41,990
I'd looked forward to that day
so much.

897
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:45,790
I'd imagined it, I'd imagined you,
both of you, in Oxford -

898
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:48,870
taking you out for lunch,
showing you round my college,

899
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:51,310
introducing you to my friends.

900
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:53,110
I had no idea you weren't
coming until

901
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:57,150
I saw my dad on his own
down Cornmarket. I was devastated.

902
00:53:57,200 --> 00:54:00,910
I was gutted. I know you've had
an upset,

903
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:04,830
but these things are not connected
and if you do this to me again,

904
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:06,630
then there's absolutely no point

905
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:09,560
in pretending that we
have any kind of a relationship.

906
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:16,520
Please, Mum. Get dressed.

907
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:26,880
Right.

908
00:54:57,680 --> 00:55:01,710
All right?
What is this...? Brilliant.

909
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:02,990
Where's Lawrence?

910
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:06,120
I don't know.
I expect he'll come with the others.

911
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:20,400
Whoa, granny! Nice outfit.

912
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:25,230
She says she's not going.

913
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:26,680
Why?

914
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:31,510
I don't want to go either.

915
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:33,350
Oh, now come on!

916
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:35,830
You can stay here with me
if you like, chicken.

917
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:37,950
I thought you said you'd
invited Angus.

918
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,870
You can't have Angus turning up
on his own,

919
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:41,790
he'll have no-one to sit with.

920
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:44,150
Hey, and what about your mother?

921
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:46,000
You all right, Gran?

922
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:49,280
I'm staying here.

923
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:52,760
You'll regret this.

924
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:55,680
Both of you. You'll regret it.

925
00:55:57,920 --> 00:55:59,550
What's happened?

926
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:01,710
Please. Please. Both of you.

927
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:05,160
Think about Caroline.
She doesn't deserve this.

928
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:23,280
I'm so glad you could come.

929
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:27,830
~ You look great! ~ Oh, thank you.

930
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:29,750
I'm glad you could make it.

931
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:33,110
~ Where's Lawrence?
~ He's coming with, um...

932
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:34,680
Oh, Gran and Alan are here.

933
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:55,040
Should we all be heading inside?

934
00:56:57,160 --> 00:56:59,950
I'm sorry, love.
I tried to persuade her.

935
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:05,080
And then Lawrence came round
and then he wouldn't come either.

936
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:13,430
Well, there's no point you being
here then. Is there?

937
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:15,640
If she's not here.

938
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:33,350
~ What's going on?
Are you not at the wedding? ~ No.

939
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:35,590
I, Caroline Elizabeth Dawson...

940
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:38,630
Do take you, Katherine Abike
McKenzie, to be my lawfully

941
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:39,750
wedded wife.

942
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:41,750
~ I've got all this money...
~ Why don't we get married?

943
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:43,390
I think we could be comfortable.

944
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:45,110
Have I got anything to say to you?

945
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:46,830
I don't want to fall out with you.

946
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:48,870
You're your own worst enemy.

947
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:53,080
~ Where you going? ~ Home. To Halifax.
If that's what you really want.
