1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:04,400
I now pronounce you spouses for life.

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,750
I meant what I said about
helping out, financially.

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,150
~ I've got a half brother.
~ I've got a son.

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,990
I am sorry. Perhaps
it's time I met him.

5
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:17,470
~ Celia, tell me about your family.
~ Do you really want to marry me?

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,030
I've wanted to marry
you since I was 16.

7
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,630
~ Are you sure about this?
~ Course! You can get on with your work.

8
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,830
I'll only be half
an hour, 40 minutes.

9
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,790
~ What's happened?
~ Kate's been hit by a car.

10
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,080
Do you want to come through
here and we'll have a chat.

11
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,030
Flora.

12
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,550
~ Really?
~ Don't you like it?

13
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,670
It's... It's up to you.

14
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:33,590
~ Isn't it up to both of us?
~ Yes. Of course. But you're... You know,

15
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:36,270
you've got more say in the matter.

16
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,790
You've got to like it.

17
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,270
I don't dislike it.

18
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,190
~ Flora Grace.
~ OK.

19
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,470
You don't sound thrilled.

20
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,470
No, I am.

21
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,070
Well, what would you call her?

22
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,990
I like that name.

23
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,950
Sweet. Good.

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,150
So you don't like it.

25
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,470
No, I do, like I say. It's
growing on me. It suits her.

26
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,830
Well, it suits her now, but
will it suit her when she's 14

27
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,510
and got opinions.

28
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,830
~ I really like it.
~ Well, then, that's all that matters.

29
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,910
~ You're just saying that.
~ I wouldn't do that.

30
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,950
If I thought it was really
abhorrent, I'd say so.

31
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,150
~ As opposed to mildly abhorrent?
~ Kate. We're calling her Flora. Flora.

32
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,350
Flora Grace.

33
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,150
There is some margarine
called Flora, of course.

34
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,710
You've put me off it now.

35
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,430
No, I haven't.

36
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:23,540
Don't talk to me like that.
That's how men talk.

37
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,710
~ So you do like Grace?
~ I like Flora.

38
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,300
You really don't. It's obvious.

39
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,870
She's your baby.

40
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,230
She's our baby.

41
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,430
KNOCK ON DOOR

42
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,680
Mum?

43
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:47,790
The hearse has arrived.

44
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,510
It's outside.

45
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,750
Right.

46
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,750
Do you want me to take the baby?

47
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,340
No, I'll...

48
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,900
Thanks.

49
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,270
To everything there is a season

50
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:42,190
and a time to every purpose on earth.

51
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:47,280
A time to be born and a time to die.

52
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:55,710
Here in this last act,

53
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,270
in sorrow but without fear,

54
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:03,510
in love and appreciation,

55
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:10,950
we commit Katherine
Abike McKenzie-Dawson

56
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,870
to a natural end.

57
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,320
Little girl. Little sweetheart.

58
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:29,110
You are going to have to decide
on a name for this baby.

59
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,190
Flora.

60
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,270
I decided just before we set off.

61
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,590
It's Flora Grace.

62
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:37,070
That's beautiful, Caroline.

63
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,590
Thank you.

64
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,920
Ginika, do you want to...

65
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,070
That's the father. Don't look.

66
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,230
Which one?

67
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,590
Pudgy, pale, face hair, 12 o'clock.

68
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,190
Keeps looking this way.

69
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,190
Used to be called Greg.

70
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,230
Probably still is.

71
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,270
He's an idiot.

72
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,990
They often are.

73
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,590
And here's another one.

74
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:15,790
John. Have you met
Ginika, Kate's mother?

75
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,550
She's a professor of economics.

76
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,270
~ Ah!
~ At Columbia.

77
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,910
Gosh, how do you do?

78
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:25,270
Terrible, tragic, awful situation.

79
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:28,150
I lecture in English at
the University of York.

80
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:31,590
Not to be confused with York
University, which is in Canada,

81
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,630
apparently.

82
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,830
~ So you've flown in?
~ No, she got on a steam packet.

83
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,270
You're Caroline's ex?

84
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,510
You must be devastated,
heart-broken. I'm so sorry.

85
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,070
You write novels?

86
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,990
Well, yes. I've published one or two.

87
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,870
Jack Protheroe, private
detective, lost soul.

88
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,630
Yes! You've... Have you read...

89
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:53,670
Oh, a long time ago.

90
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,430
My favourite is The Haunted Man.

91
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:01,470
It's entertaining, it's interesting,
it's insightful. You're very clever.

92
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,190
~ Gosh, well, that's...
~ Dad? Dad!

93
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,870
You need to move your car.
You've blocked someone in.

94
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:10,020
She's left her handbag
at the crematorium.

95
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,460
~ Would you excuse me?
~ Sure.

96
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,270
That'll have made his day.

97
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,260
You don't like him.

98
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,710
I didn't like Kate's
husband, Richard.

99
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:26,390
My mother didn't like
my first husband,

100
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:29,190
Douglas, the one with Alzheimer's.

101
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:32,180
Maybe it's normal.
Maybe it's a thing.

102
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,830
Did your mother like
your first husband?

103
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,230
Kenneth?

104
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,350
She thought the world of him,

105
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,640
but she wouldn't have done if she had
known the things I knew about him.

106
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:47,350
I like Caroline.

107
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,230
I was very fond of Kate.

108
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:53,190
She'd come round and play Scrabble
with me sometimes in the evening,

109
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,470
when I was on my own.

110
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,550
I found it difficult at first,

111
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:05,950
and I wasn't always as kind
as I might have been, but...

112
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,110
~ It was a surprise.
~ Well, not entirely, if I'm being honest.

113
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,430
Kate was very happy

114
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,150
with Caroline.

115
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,040
~ Most of the time.
~ I know.

116
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,600
So, Flora Grace.

117
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,440
Well, I know for a fact
Kate would've liked that.

118
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,630
Hello. Sorry.

119
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,870
I know we didn't hit it off,

120
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:41,120
but I couldn't not come.

121
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:45,000
We were college buddies, apart
from anything else, so...

122
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:49,580
How's... I know I'm
not supposed to ask...

123
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,750
~ .. but how's the baby?
~ She's fine.

124
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,510
She's fine.

125
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,670
~ A girl?
~ Yes.

126
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,230
I couldn't have a look
at her, could I?

127
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:03,000
~ That wasn't the plan, was it?
~ No.

128
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,590
~ What's going to happen to her?
~ She's going to be fine.

129
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,630
~ Are you...
~ I'm looking after her.

130
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,750
~ Is that...
~ Official? Yes.

131
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,670
I'm on the birth certificate
as her parent.

132
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,430
No, I was going to say,
is that what you want?

133
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,550
Yes. Of course it is.

134
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,310
It must be tough.

135
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:26,230
I mean, it's not what you thought
you were buying into, is it?

136
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:29,070
You didn't want her to have a baby
and now you're the one left with it.

137
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,910
Well, I didn't not want
her to have a baby.

138
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,790
Sorry, I must've misunderstood.

139
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,590
I wanted what she wanted.

140
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,510
She said you weren't
as keen as she was.

141
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:40,660
I wasn't, but I wouldn't
have stopped her.

142
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,310
I'm sorry.

143
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,720
I'd better go. I've got to get
the train back to Manchester.

144
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,670
I just...

145
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:53,310
I wanted just to say,

146
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,030
I can see you've got a
lot of help and support,

147
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,470
but, if you just wanted someone
to look after her for a bit or...

148
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:02,510
And, as I say, under
any other circumstances

149
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,430
I wouldn't be offering.
I'd have backed off.

150
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,590
I wouldn't even be here. That was
the deal and I'm aware of that,

151
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,910
but, if ever there was anything,

152
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:14,070
I'm flexible, I'm self-employed,
I can work anywhere,

153
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,590
so I wouldn't want you to
feel like you couldn't ask

154
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,200
or that it'd be inconvenient, because
chances are it wouldn't be.

155
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,560
~ That's all.
~ OK.

156
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,550
Well, thank you.

157
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,990
Have you... Have you got my number?

158
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,310
It...

159
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,350
It'll be on Kate's phone.

160
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,240
Well...

161
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,030
She's in the kitchen

162
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:46,790
with my mum or Kate's
mum if you want to

163
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,710
have a look at her.

164
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:51,350
I shouldn't have asked.

165
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,140
It's up to you.

166
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,840
OK.

167
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:03,590
Thing is, she's with Kate's mother

168
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:07,160
and Kate's mother
thinks I'm an idiot.

169
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,310
A teaspoonful of baking
powder, a splash of milk,

170
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:15,670
a drop of vanilla essence
and bob's your uncle.

171
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,270
Mum. Ginika.

172
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,280
~ This is Greg.
~ Hi.

173
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,270
Greg's the...

174
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,390
Flora's biological...

175
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,470
Hi, Mrs McKenzie.

176
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:31,670
I haven't been Mrs McKenzie
in 20 years, Greg.

177
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,520
Of course. Divorced. Gosh.

178
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,350
Greg wanted to...

179
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,750
~ Support her head.
~ Yeah.

180
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,560
Yeah.

181
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,920
OK.

182
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,990
Have you seen Alan?

183
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,390
Alan?

184
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,390
He went into the garden to have
a cigarette with my Head of Maths.

185
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,590
Alan doesn't smoke.

186
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:13,430
~ No. I didn't know Chris did either.
~ And you just let him?

187
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,750
He has a heart condition.

188
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,360
Wow.

189
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:26,190
Course they've built the
M6 toll road since then,

190
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,990
so I've no idea if that's
any more efficient.

191
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,510
Oh, shit!

192
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,670
~ Are you smoking?
~ No.

193
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,230
~ You were smoking.
~ I weren't.

194
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,790
Why else would you be standing
out here in the drizzle?

195
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,310
I just...

196
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,630
Did you know he has
a heart condition?

197
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,070
~ This is Chris.
~ Hi.

198
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,790
You'd think a mathematician
would know better.

199
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,030
I could have you sacked.

200
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,870
Giving cigarettes to a man
with a heart condition.

201
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,550
Yes, I'm Caroline's mother.

202
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,510
It were only the one.

203
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:02,270
~ I didn't know you smoked.
~ I don't. I used to.

204
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,230
I just like the very
occasional one now. Every...

205
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:08,590
Look, last one I had were
millennium. Now, when were that?

206
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:11,710
~ I thought I knew you.
~ You do.

207
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,190
Women, cigarettes...

208
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,110
~ How would you like it if I started smoking?
~ I wouldn't.

209
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,430
Oh, then I think I might.

210
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:22,190
~ Can I have a cigarette, Chris?
~ Sure.

211
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,350
See how you like it.

212
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:26,110
You don't have to smoke a
cigarette to prove a point.

213
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,110
And at a funeral, as well.

214
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,700
Are you going to let this drop?

215
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,990
There you go.

216
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,350
I think I might go back inside.

217
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:39,470
Don't let me stop you. I
don't want your cigarettes.

218
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,520
Right, well, I'll...

219
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:51,390
~ 'Ere, showing me up!
~ You want showing up!

220
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,270
It's only because I care about you.

221
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:57,230
It were only an excuse
to get a bit of fresh air.

222
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,910
Seriously, do you smoke?

223
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,100
No!

224
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,400
No.

225
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,460
Do you fancy a sherbet?

226
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,150
You all right?

227
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,550
I don't know who half
these people are.

228
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,510
They weren't at the wedding.

229
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:27,030
~ Mind you, we didn't invite
very many people to the wedding.
~ No.

230
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:30,830
Well, we did, unofficially, but
most of them couldn't come.

231
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,550
No, well, I'm sorry. We were busy.

232
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,830
No matter. It was all
a bit last minute.

233
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,420
We only did it for her, really.

234
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,910
He's the father.

235
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,390
The biological father.

236
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:47,350
And Ginika's the grandmother.

237
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,590
The biological...

238
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,180
Kate's mum.

239
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,070
And I'm not actually anything.

240
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,390
~ She's got colic.
~ Jesus, you don't need that.

241
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,870
She seems OK at the minute.

242
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,260
You wait till six o' clock.

243
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,670
It's like flicking a switch

244
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:13,430
and then it can go on till about

245
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:16,480
three o'clock in the morning.
It's terrible. It's like...

246
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:27,950
It's like she's crying for her
mother, and I know it's colic,

247
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,470
but that's what it feels like.

248
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,040
BABY CRIES

249
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,990
Shush-shush-shush.

250
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,190
All it does is cry.

251
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,430
It goes on till three or
four o'clock in the morning,

252
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,990
and you can't do anything else.

253
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,670
You can't concentrate on anything
else and it's ridiculous.

254
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,990
~ Yeah, no, it's... It must be.
~ Yeah, well, it's worse for Mum.

255
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,550
No, it isn't. She wanted it.

256
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,430
I don't even know what
it's for. What does it do?

257
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,670
It just cries and shits.

258
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,950
~ Oi! Oi!
~ That'll do.

259
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,190
It's not even ours, and you're
not even here, so shut up.

260
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:04,190
Yeah, and you're old enough to start
trying to help her and support her,

261
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,430
instead of behaving like
a self-centred little dick

262
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,430
~ all the time.
~ Piss off.
~ Oh, you piss off.

263
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,350
Stop it!

264
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:13,700
Mum's got enough on her
plate without you...

265
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,550
I thought you were having a lie down.

266
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:20,190
~ Yeah, but I couldn't sleep, so...
~ She's fine! She's fine!

267
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,470
I'm just going to take her
out for a bit of fresh air.

268
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:26,750
~ No, you don't have to.
~ I want to! We're in love. We've bonded.

269
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,310
Hands off.

270
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:32,070
Driving. That's meant to
be good for colicky babies.

271
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,230
Has she got something
I can wrap her up in?

272
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:37,270
Yes, she's got a lovely little pink
velour coat and a matching hat

273
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,950
that Alan and me bought her.

274
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,070
It's the vibration and the sound.

275
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,670
It's like being in the womb.

276
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,600
Obviously, it's all very DH Lawrence.

277
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,510
The pushchair's in the hall,
love, and there's a blanket.

278
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,470
I'll be an hour or so.

279
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,860
~ You get some rest.
~ Thanks.

280
00:15:56,840 --> 00:16:00,510
I'm going to have to sit down.

281
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,870
I've done what I can.

282
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,390
Oh, Alan, you go in there.
I'll bring you some tea.

283
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,670
Are you all right, love?

284
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,870
Yeah.

285
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,190
Yeah.

286
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,860
Where's Kate's mum?

287
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,640
~ She's having a lie down, as well, I think.
~ Is she all right?

288
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,560
No, of course she's not. It's
not meant to happen, is it?

289
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:32,100
One of your children
going before you.

290
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,830
He can't stand it, the crying.

291
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,620
I can't either.

292
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,470
Do we know any more
about what's happened

293
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,270
to the idiots that knocked her down?

294
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,030
Oh, did I not tell you?

295
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,030
Well, you said there were
charges of car theft,

296
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,630
reckless driving and manslaughter.

297
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,390
They were released on bail,

298
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:58,670
~ day before yesterday.
~ No!

299
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,000
And you laugh at me when I say
we should bring back hanging.

300
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08,920
I'll go and see if
Lawrence is all right.

301
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,710
You go and sit down
in there with Alan.

302
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:15,760
~ I'll bring you both some tea.
~ You sure?

303
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:19,630
Yeah, go on. Off you pop.

304
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,790
See you in a bit.

305
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:28,430
There's a tea towel there.

306
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,640
Yeah. Actually, I might pop out and
get a bit of fresh air, as well.

307
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,000
You're transparent. You
do know that, don't you?

308
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,550
Mum's making the tea.

309
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,190
She caught me smoking.

310
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,870
Ah, that was my fault.

311
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:51,060
So I'm in bother again.

312
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:54,590
I'm glad you got over that...

313
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,140
.. other thing.

314
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,390
I'm not entirely sure we have.

315
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:05,190
I think it's been put on hold.

316
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:09,030
And there are no other
skeletons, are there,

317
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,430
in the cupboard?

318
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,510
I know it's none of my
business, but she's my mum.

319
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,670
No.

320
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:19,040
No more skeletons. I
weren't like your dad.

321
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:22,590
Well,

322
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,630
except,

323
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,910
~ I wonder if I were.
~ What do you mean?

324
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,200
Not... Not different women, just...

325
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,720
I did love Eileen...

326
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,670
.. but, then, a slow,
dawning realisation

327
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:40,830
that you've settled for summat that

328
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:45,080
you knew all along weren't
really what you wanted.

329
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,190
When she became pregnant
with Gillian,

330
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:53,310
I thought it were what I wanted, but,

331
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,470
actually, it frightened me.

332
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:59,150
Delighted me, but

333
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,080
frightened me, like, "Is this it?"

334
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,430
I'm sorry. I'm sounding
like I'm making excuses,

335
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,280
but, no, it never happened
again, so...

336
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,550
Sorry. Sorry.

337
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:17,470
I shouldn't have started
talking about that. Not now.

338
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,150
He wasn't all bad, my dad.

339
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,430
No.

340
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,390
No.

341
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:26,350
Right, who wants to be mother?

342
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,670
You do.

343
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,390
I caught him smoking. Did I tell you?

344
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,470
Yes, it was me that... I'm sorry.

345
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,510
What're you apologising to him for?

346
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:40,630
He's 76! If he can't have
one single tiny cigarette

347
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:43,390
without being made to feel
like a six-year-old.

348
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,470
We'll find out he's been spying
for the Russians next.

349
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:49,550
Well, we've all got our
shortcomings, haven't we?

350
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,350
He smokes, you read the Daily Mail.

351
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,350
I don't smoke!

352
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,870
Only for the telly page.

353
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:58,960
~ Of course, you're perfect, aren't you.
~ Ish.

354
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,340
There you go, love.

355
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,590
John's gone after Gillian.

356
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,360
I told him, I said,
"You're transparent."

357
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,830
Sorry. Hi.

358
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,230
Yeah, I know.

359
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:21,640
Predictable, boring, transparent.

360
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,870
~ How're things?
~ Fine.

361
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,520
Good. Good.

362
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,950
I wanted to...

363
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:33,310
Look, I know this is difficult,

364
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,390
it's awkward,

365
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,840
but, you know, we're adults.

366
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,830
~ We can...
~ Me and Robbie's getting married.

367
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,950
I told you he'd asked me,
and now I've said yes.

368
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,670
I said yes two weeks ago,

369
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,590
only we've not told anyone yet.

370
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:51,510
We were just waiting until after
the funeral to announce it properly.

371
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:54,350
So you're the first to know.

372
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,350
OK. Well, that's

373
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,670
good.

374
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,750
That's...

375
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:01,910
The thing...

376
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:05,390
The thing I wanted to say was that,
given what's happened with Kate,

377
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,910
I think she needs me here.

378
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,910
Caroline.

379
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:13,590
I think she needs me here
for Lawrence, probably,

380
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:16,390
so I... Obviously...

381
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:20,790
Me offering you financial help
with the farm, as I did,

382
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,830
~ might be something that I can't...
~ That's fine.

383
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,480
~ Can't do any more.
~ That's fine.

384
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,920
~ Still, if you're marrying Robbie...
~ Yes, it's fine.

385
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,630
~ Are you sure he's...
~ Yes.

386
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:39,350
~ .. really what you want?
~ Yes, I am.

387
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,670
Good.

388
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,790
~ I didn't take it very seriously anyway.
~ No?

389
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,680
No. Good.

390
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,470
~ Well, that's all I wanted
to say. Thank you for...
~ Sure.

391
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,720
~ .. being so understanding.
~ It's no problem.

392
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,510
I do think it's a mistake.

393
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,900
Robbie.

394
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,880
~ I don't care what you think.
~ He's so...

395
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,870
No.

396
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,230
No, I don't suppose you do.

397
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:16,110
We haven't told anyone, yet,
about us getting married.

398
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,030
What with Kate.

399
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,350
So don't go repeating it.

400
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,640
DOOR OPENS

401
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,590
She's asleep, believe it or not.

402
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,310
I don't know how long for.

403
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,310
I've left her in her pram.

404
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,700
Thanks.

405
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,510
She's a sweet baby.

406
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:15,670
I mean, when she's not
screaming blue mur...

407
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,860
Screaming her head off.

408
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,550
Do you not think?

409
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:23,400
I think I prefer them when
they get to be about 15.

410
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,030
Has everyone gone?

411
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,390
Mum and Alan are next door.

412
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:30,190
They'll be asleep in front of the
telly and Kate's mum's in bed.

413
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,780
Poor woman.

414
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,870
Mm.

415
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,390
Poor you.

416
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:39,120
~ I'd better be making tracks myself.
~ Sure.

417
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:46,680
Listen, I wanted to talk
to you about something.

418
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,070
Now might not be the time,

419
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,990
but I don't want you to hear
it from my dad or your mum

420
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:55,040
~ and get the wrong end of the stick.
~ OK.

421
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,140
I've started...

422
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,510
I've been seeing Robbie again,

423
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:16,030
and I know. I know
you think that's bad,

424
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,830
given what...

425
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,990
The thing I told you,

426
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:24,190
but he's good for me, he's right
for me, he stops me being a pillock,

427
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:27,600
and now he's asked me to
marry him and I've said yes.

428
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,510
Caroline.

429
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,230
Caroline.

430
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,230
Caroline.

431
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:44,230
~ I can't think about that now.
~ No, I know. I just...

432
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:47,560
Like I said, I didn't want you
hearing it from anyone else.

433
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:51,070
What's going through your head?

434
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,510
Anything?

435
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:57,030
I don't know. I guess if you can
live with it that's your business.

436
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,350
Can you?

437
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,790
Can I what?

438
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,150
Do that?

439
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,630
Live with someone, sleep
with someone, knowing you

440
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,870
murdered his brother?

441
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:10,390
I don't think I could. I think
it's just something I'd avoid.

442
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:14,270
I had a lot to put
up with with Eddie.

443
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,920
I did exp...

444
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:17,830
I did tell you that.

445
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:18,950
Yes, I know.

446
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,350
I like Robbie. I've
always liked Robbie.

447
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,630
He likes me.

448
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,310
He loves me.

449
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:28,430
It's him I should've married,

450
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,750
all those years ago, and none
of this would ever've...

451
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:33,390
I'm sorry, I can't
think about it now.

452
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,190
No. Sure.

453
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,870
You know, you were
the one, that night,

454
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:40,310
saying that's why it could never
be a good idea, you and Robbie.

455
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:42,590
What I said the next day, I
was just agreeing with you.

456
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,030
I have no memory of that.

457
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:48,110
Well, no, but

458
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,310
you did.

459
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:52,310
Yeah, well, he's asked
me and I've said yes.

460
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:54,750
I can't... I can't
let him down again.

461
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,670
I thought we said we
were going to pretend

462
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,870
you never told me about Eddie.

463
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,270
Yeah. Yeah, we did.

464
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,120
All right, then.

465
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:06,070
~ Right.
~ So...

466
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:09,200
You do what you like. You do
what you feel comfortable with.

467
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,600
Like I need your permission.

468
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,240
BABY CRIES

469
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,990
HORN BEEPS

470
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,790
Morning.

471
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,110
Hiya.

472
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,700
How was it?

473
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:19,270
How was Caroline?

474
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:21,360
Quiet. Tired.

475
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:26,470
I don't know why you wouldn't
let me come with you.

476
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,480
Sweet little baby.

477
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,280
So sad, so heartbreaking.

478
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:38,470
Was that feckless streak
of oily shite there?

479
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:41,070
Oh, John. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

480
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,790
So, probably good job
you weren't there.

481
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,350
Did you talk to him?

482
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,470
No.

483
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,430
No longer than necessary.

484
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:52,310
Can you imagine going to
your ex-wife's girlfriend...

485
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,870
Partner's funeral?

486
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:56,510
He's just... He's got no...

487
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,550
I don't know.

488
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,830
Decorum.

489
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,710
Yeah. Well, you know what
middle-class people are like.

490
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:06,070
They fall out and get divorced, then
they're still speaking to each other

491
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:09,310
just to show how grown-up
they all are.

492
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,910
Knob.

493
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,670
Yup.

494
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,110
But she were all right? Caroline?

495
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,960
She's got colic.

496
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:18,470
The baby. Flora.

497
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:21,750
So, on top of everything
else, she's just exhausted.

498
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,910
Was everything all
right here, yesterday?

499
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:26,430
Yeah, I didn't see much
of 'em, to be honest.

500
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,910
Raff were over at Gary's
place all day again

501
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,910
and Ellie took Calamity
to her mother's.

502
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,070
I've no idea how that went.

503
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:36,870
I saw to t'sheep, then I got
called in for some of overtime,

504
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:39,590
I had to cover a three-ten, so...

505
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,830
Are we going to tell 'em? About us?

506
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:44,150
You said after t'funeral.

507
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,150
Yep.

508
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,800
So, today?

509
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,760
Today.

510
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:57,950
Then we need to start thinking about
what sort of do we're having.

511
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,630
And where. And who we're inviting.

512
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:03,390
What sort of budget d'you
think we're looking at?

513
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:06,990
Cos you know I've got... very little.

514
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:09,790
I mean, me dad might stick
his hand in his pocket, but...

515
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,070
~ And your Gary.
~ I'm not asking Gary, for anything.

516
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,670
I've only known him five minutes!

517
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,260
I'm joking!

518
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,030
How did Raff get on
with him yesterday?

519
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,470
Great time,

520
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:24,310
sun shines out of his trousers.

521
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:26,700
Gary is God. It's official.

522
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:31,630
Erm... Registry Office, not church.

523
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:34,470
Then we can have, like, an
hog roast up at t'Sportsman's.

524
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:37,630
Like, a barbecue and a buffet.
We could get a marquee.

525
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,190
Steady on.

526
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,270
~ And a band.
~ What sort of band?

527
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:43,260
Well, a DJ, anyway.

528
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,110
~ We'll think about it.
~ And a honeymoon!

529
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,790
We're definitely going on honeymoon.

530
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,110
And for two weeks. Two whole weeks.

531
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,680
Longer.

532
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,470
Why don't we go for four?

533
00:29:56,520 --> 00:30:00,070
Four weeks. Somewhere
really exciting, like...

534
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,710
Australia. You could go
and meet all your cousins!

535
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:05,390
~ Yeah.
~ He can look after t'sheep.

536
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,430
~ Who can?
~ You can.
~ When?

537
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:11,600
When me and your mum
go off on us honeymoon.

538
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,790
Robbie's asked me to marry him and...

539
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:18,990
I've said yes.

540
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:21,230
~ Really?
~ Yeah.

541
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:23,190
~ No, really?
~ Yeah.

542
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,870
No, seriously?

543
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,360
Yes!

544
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,790
~ Good luck, buddy.
~ Shut up!

545
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,470
No, nice one. You probably
need your head examined but...

546
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:34,790
~ Will you...?
~ I'm joking!

547
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:38,790
Well, I'm not. Congratulations! When?

548
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:42,030
~ Soon as.
~ Are you inviting people
from work? Like, erm...

549
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,630
Well, everybody except Cheryl, yeah.

550
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:48,510
We don't mention that name
in this house, thank you.

551
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:50,150
Aww!

552
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,740
You're mad, both of you. But...

553
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:55,750
.. I'm very happy for you.

554
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,950
Oh, Gary says why haven't
you rang him?

555
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,590
~ Rung him.
~ That's what I said. He thinks
you've fell out with him.

556
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,670
Fallen out with him. Why?

557
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:10,190
~ Yeah, you and me
~ Grandad. Why?
~ I don't know.
~ Why's he think that?

558
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,580
I'm just passing a message.

559
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:23,830
I'll pop round in a few minutes
and see how she's getting on.

560
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,020
Mm.

561
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:30,520
~ MOBILE PHONE VIBRATES
~ Ooh, that's me.

562
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:36,470
"Hi, Grandad. Guess what.

563
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:39,070
"Mum and Uncle Robbie
are getting married.

564
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,950
"Did you know?" No,
I damn well didn't!

565
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,000
"She must have told that
John tosser to eff off."

566
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:51,590
"I hope Caroline is OK. Gary
says why haven't you rang him.

567
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,240
"Love Raff".

568
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:57,560
~ Married.
~ Well, well!

569
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:04,470
I will do everything I can for
you. OK? But it would really help

570
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:08,070
if you could stop doing
all this crying at night.

571
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:11,600
I know you can't help it, and I know you
haven't a clue what I'm talking about.

572
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,880
SHE SIGHS

573
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:20,150
Your mum would've been
so thrilled with you.

574
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:23,200
With every tiny, tiny
little bit of you.

575
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,320
Right, well,...

576
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,670
.. we've got options.

577
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:35,540
Just interrupt me if I say anything
you like the sound of.

578
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:38,680
One, and this is a big one,...

579
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:42,460
.. is that I take early retirement.

580
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,630
I'd have to sell this
place, probably,

581
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:49,790
but, on the plus side, I've got a
not insubstantial pension going on.

582
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:53,320
I am nothing if not a smart cookie.
You'll soon get used to that.

583
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:58,190
The flaw in that plan
is that I am still...

584
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,380
not without ambition...

585
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:04,390
.. in the old career department...

586
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:10,060
.. which brings me onto
option number two.

587
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:15,840
We ask other people to
get involved and help out.

588
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,440
My mother.

589
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:24,190
My mother. Have you met my mother?

590
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:29,790
Oh, and then there's John. The ex.
You have met John. Several times.

591
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:32,950
He's the one who was going on about
Rudyard Kipling the other day

592
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,830
when I was trying to have a nervous
breakdown. He's an idiot.

593
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:38,390
Well, he's not an idiot,
he's just someone

594
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:41,470
who never got the hang of
being one of the grown-ups,

595
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:44,560
which you could say is
part of his charm, or not.

596
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,390
But,

597
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:51,310
he was very good with my other
two when they were little.

598
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,990
Well, he was and he wasn't.

599
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:56,240
And, then, of course, there's
always the nanny option.

600
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:00,230
But I know what your
mum'd think about that.

601
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:02,390
That's not happening.

602
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,150
Yeah, she'd hate it.

603
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,470
She'd say, "That was
never part of the plan."

604
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:08,990
~ Well, it wasn't.
~ No, I know.

605
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:13,280
But you not being here wasn't
part of the plan either, was it?

606
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,630
~ She's talking to herself.
~ She's talking to the baby, you knob.

607
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,870
Is that the sort of language
they teach you at Oxford?

608
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:22,430
~ Well, he is a knob.
~ You're a knob.
~ Knob.

609
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:25,790
~ Is Kate's mum up?
~ Knob.
~ Not seen her.

610
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:29,990
It cried again, till like
20 to three this morning.

611
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,830
Have you tried using earplugs?

612
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,830
~ You can still hear it!
~ Her!

613
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:37,270
~ It's not even ours.
~ He's got to stop saying that,
Gran, he's going to upset Mum.

614
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:39,870
~ Well, she's no-one else's, love.
~ Who's its father?

615
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:42,910
It was that, erm...
He was here yesterday.

616
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,870
~ Which one?
~ Tall. Pasty-faced.

617
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:48,430
Ginger-ish. Got a, like a bit
of a beard thing going on.

618
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,870
Gavin.

619
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,870
~ Gareth. Gilbert.
~ Gandalf?

620
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,720
Greg! It's Greg.

621
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,430
You'd never think he'd
be Kate's sort. Still.

622
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,910
Yeah, well, why can't HE take it?

623
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:03,070
God, you really know how to make
yourself popular, don't you?

624
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:06,320
Has anybody taken your
mother a cup of tea?

625
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,550
KNOCK AT DOOR

626
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,310
Can I come in?

627
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:16,950
Hello.

628
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,160
BABY GURGLES

629
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,430
It won't last forever,...

630
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,750
.. feeling like this.

631
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:40,140
I know it's hard for you
to imagine that just now.

632
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,910
When did you ever feel like this?

633
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:47,160
~ Not when my dad died.
~ No, no. It was when MY dad died.

634
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,870
I cried for an entire week,

635
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,510
solid.

636
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:55,430
I worshipped the ground he walked on.

637
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:57,710
59 years old.

638
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,150
He's been dead...

639
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,670
47, 48 years now.

640
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:06,750
1966,

641
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,940
the year you were born.

642
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:13,440
I thought I would never smile again.

643
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:17,440
And then... you came along.

644
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:21,310
And you looked just like him.

645
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:24,760
Do you think it's weird, being dead?

646
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:29,000
Well, we all get to find
out eventually, don't we?

647
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:34,070
I doubt it.

648
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:36,710
I reckon once you're
gone, you're gone.

649
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:40,520
~ I think it's more weird
for the people left behind.
~ Mm.

650
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:46,790
Do you think some people
linger longer...

651
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,440
than others?

652
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:53,390
I suppose it can feel
like that sometimes.

653
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:56,830
I think it's more in your
imagination, isn't it,

654
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,590
that sort of thing?

655
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:01,190
I can't help...

656
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:02,920
worrying...

657
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:08,720
.. imagining what she did and
didn't know when she got hit...

658
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,230
.. what she went through,
what she was thinking,

659
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:14,870
however quick it was.

660
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:16,550
How frightened she must've been,

661
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:19,230
wondering what the hell
was happening to her.

662
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,710
She was such a peaceful person,

663
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:25,060
she was so calm, she
was so kind, and then...

664
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:30,080
.. to die like that so
violently... It's just so...

665
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:35,990
Not in a million years is that
what should've happened to her.

666
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:38,000
It's very unfair.

667
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:43,280
But I'm afraid, love,
life can be very unfair.

668
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,830
You...

669
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:50,280
It'll be tough for a while.

670
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:55,630
But you'll come out the
other side. You will.

671
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,670
Eventually.

672
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,590
You know you will.

673
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,750
Cos you're...

674
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:06,670
You're resilient.

675
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:09,640
~ SHE SOBS
~ You're clever.

676
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:15,320
SHE SOBS

677
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,620
Oh, sweetheart.

678
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:50,510
Did you take Ginika some tea?

679
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,670
~ Yes, I did.
~ Is she all right?

680
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:56,550
I think so.

681
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:59,270
I've been thinking about options.

682
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:02,110
I really don't want to give
up my job, I'd resent it,

683
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,550
and that wouldn't be
good for either of us.

684
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:07,270
~ Any of us. Would it?
~ No.
~ Would it?
~ No.

685
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:11,150
And I can't go part-time as
a head teacher, it's just...

686
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:15,080
~ Not even for a few months?
~ It's not fair on the school.

687
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:18,110
Well, what was Kate going to do?

688
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:22,630
Well, she was going to take a year
off and then she was going to come
back part-time. It's easier...

689
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:28,000
for teachers, it's completely
different. And the thing is...

690
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,990
.. she'd hate it if
I employed a nanny

691
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:36,470
~ whilst Flora's so tiny.
~ Mm.

692
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:39,670
So, the thing is...

693
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:42,470
I'll do what I can, love, for you,

694
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:47,310
but, you know, with the best
will in the world, I'm 76.

695
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:49,430
I know. I wasn't...

696
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:54,070
I'm sorry. I wasn't going to
ask you to do anything full-time

697
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:57,750
but if I could balance a few options,

698
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:00,670
could you, you and Alan, could you...

699
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:04,240
I don't know, do the odd...

700
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,950
.. shift?

701
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,470
Yes. Yes, of course we could.

702
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:20,670
Gillian and Robbie are getting
married. We've just had a text.

703
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,550
Yes, I know, she told me last night.

704
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:26,350
I think he could be a
very good thing for her.

705
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,470
She was married to his brother.

706
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:31,760
Yeah, well, it's not unheard of.

707
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,520
~ No.
~ Is it?

708
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,830
What's up?

709
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:42,510
~ You don't fancy her, do you?
~ Do you MIND?!

710
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:45,910
~ Well, I just...
~ We're friends!
~ I know. Right.
~ Ish.

711
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:48,760
When she's not behaving like a twit.

712
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:54,030
People do have nannies
from being this tiny.

713
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:55,750
Yeah, I know.

714
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:01,340
It'd just be a matter of
finding the right person.

715
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,470
~ Gosh.
~ Just say no...

716
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:07,190
~ No.
~ .. if it's a stupid idea.

717
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:11,830
~ No, it's...
~ I know you've got no
reason to want to help me.

718
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,790
No, it's...

719
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:16,470
~ intriguing.
~ It just occurred to me

720
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:20,750
because you seemed to want to
be involved after you lost...

721
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,670
Yeah.

722
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:26,120
~ Judith's, and...
~ Yeah. Yeah.

723
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,040
Yeah.

724
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:33,310
No, you're right, it's a stupid idea.

725
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:36,660
I don't know why I thought
of it. Forget it.

726
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,750
I could...

727
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:41,140
try and help you out maybe.

728
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:45,230
One afternoon a week.
For an hour. Or so.

729
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:50,150
And then if Celia did a couple
of days a week. Or more.

730
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:53,040
~ She's 76.
~ Sure. Sure.

731
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,020
It's not...

732
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:03,480
It's not really what Kate
would've wanted. Me. Is it?

733
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:09,200
I mean, obviously, I'd be happy to
do the occasional, odd... but...

734
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:14,920
Realistically, on a regular
basis, I don't think...

735
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:27,150
You're still intending to buy a flat
or something close by, aren't you?

736
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,070
So you can spend more
time with Lawrence?

737
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:32,670
~ Sure. Sure.
~ Have you actually started looking?

738
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:35,080
Erm... no.

739
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:39,230
But I will

740
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:41,710
and I will help you, Caroline.

741
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,750
I will, I'll do what I can, I'll
help you out as often as I can.

742
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:47,070
But I think...

743
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:49,470
You've got to be realistic.

744
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:51,430
You've been dealt a terrible blow,

745
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:53,110
it's awful, it's...

746
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:56,230
But the point is,

747
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:59,350
you have to see that
this is life-changing

748
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:01,670
and you can't pretend it isn't.

749
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:05,670
You've either going to have
to employ a full-time...

750
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:09,470
proper person who knows how
to look after people this tiny

751
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:13,080
or give up your job,
at least temporarily.

752
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:18,160
I can't do that. I can't
give up my job, I'd go mad.

753
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,630
~ Are you going to drive me to the station?
~ Sure.

754
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:24,750
~ I can...
~ I'll do it.

755
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:35,350
Ring me, text me, and let me
know you've got back safely.

756
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:37,600
You look after yourself.

757
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:41,830
Bye-bye, baby.

758
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:47,670
She's your sister, you know that, don't
you? You will think of her as your sister.

759
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:49,640
Course I do.

760
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:52,630
Course I will.

761
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:57,160
~ See you.
~ Bye-bye, love.

762
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:16,880
~ Now what?
~ God knows.

763
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:22,070
~ You're doing really well, you know.
~ No, I'm not.

764
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:24,710
~ I think you are.
~ I'm talking to myself!

765
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:27,430
That's usually a sign of madness.

766
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:30,270
You could always ring Greg.

767
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:32,110
~ I'm not ringing Greg.
~ He did offer.

768
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:34,230
I'm not ringing Greg.

769
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:38,030
Maybe he isn't as big a
twerp as you think he is.

770
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:40,150
No, I think as twerps go
- in the twerp department -

771
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:41,390
Greg goes off the deep end.

772
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:43,830
~ You just don't like him.
~ No shit, Sherlock.

773
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:46,270
~ Don't swear in front of Flora.
~ Sorry.

774
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:49,990
~ You over-use that phrase anyway.
You know that, don't you?
~ Yup.

775
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:54,590
You do realise, as well, that Greg

776
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:58,190
is the only person on the
planet who's likely to

777
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:02,030
feel as protective towards
Flora as you and my mum do.

778
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:04,190
And what use is my mum going to be?

779
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:07,740
She's winging it back to
the States on Tuesday.

780
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:11,830
Would you really hate
it if I got a nanny?

781
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:14,390
A good nanny, a really good,
expensive, proper nanny.

782
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:16,630
~ I wouldn't speak to you, Caroline.
~ Look...

783
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:19,430
You've got Mary Poppins in your
head. That nanny doesn't exist.

784
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:20,910
Let me ring some of those numbers.

785
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:23,870
We might both be pleasantly
surprised. I promise. I promise.

786
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:26,310
I won't do anything you'd hate.

787
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:27,870
Look! I love this kid too!

788
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:29,790
Not as much as you would've
done, but I do.

789
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:32,510
I love her and I will do
everything I can for her!

790
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:35,230
But I've got to deal with it all!

791
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:52,070
~ What confuses me though,
Mother, if I'm being...
~ Disingenuous.

792
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:53,550
Honest.

793
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:55,070
What does that mean?

794
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:56,590
He knows.

795
00:45:57,160 --> 00:46:00,310
Is that less than two
weeks ago, John stayed.

796
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:02,870
~ Yeah, but nothing happened.
~ He slept in your room.

797
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:05,230
~ That doesn't mean owt.
~ It usually does.

798
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:07,220
He crashed out. OK?

799
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:11,390
I feel sorry for John.

800
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:14,030
He's like a lost... little...

801
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:15,470
He's in his 60s.

802
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:17,190
No, he isn't!

803
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:19,470
Is he?

804
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:20,910
What about Cheryl?

805
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:22,910
You know about Cheryl!

806
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:24,670
She's cleared out and gone.

807
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:27,110
And Robbie only went with
her in the first place

808
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:29,670
because he was reacting
against me being a...

809
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:31,310
Being a...?

810
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:33,120
Twit.

811
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:38,510
So you and John - that's
all over and done with?

812
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:40,950
~ I don't even like John any more.
~ Like forever?

813
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,310
I'm not sure I ever did.

814
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:45,510
~ Till next time.
~ Well, no, I don't dislike him.

815
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:47,430
I just think he brings out daft

816
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:50,390
stupid stuff in me and I don't
want to be like that any more.

817
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:52,110
OK?

818
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:57,510
And Robbie's asked me and
- you know - you like him,

819
00:46:57,560 --> 00:47:00,390
I like him. It's a no-brainer.

820
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:02,310
Oh, right up your street, then.

821
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:06,270
You're so funny! You're
so witty, you're so sharp.

822
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:10,150
~ Yup.
~ He's got all cocky since he's
started working at Gary's.

823
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:12,750
God knows why. It's
only a Saturday job.

824
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:14,030
Cock o' t'midden.

825
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:16,470
It's so cool having an
uncle who's the boss.

826
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:19,670
People falling all over themselves
being nice... to me!

827
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:21,630
~ Cock o' the dung-hill.
~ Did you ring him?

828
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:23,150
When have I had time?

829
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:24,430
He said to ring him.

830
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:26,950
And I don't want to hear
any smart-arse shit-stirring

831
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,710
comments about John
in front of Robbie.

832
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:30,910
Right?

833
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:32,630
Hiya!

834
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:34,830
Supper'll be ready in
a quarter of an hour.

835
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:37,150
Fantastic! Perfect!

836
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:39,350
Can I do anything? Set the table?

837
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:41,590
No, you're all right,
love. I've done it.

838
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:43,590
Are we inviting Gary to t'wedding?

839
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:45,630
~ Sure.
~ No.
~ Why not?

840
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:48,030
~ Why aren't we?
~ We might as well.

841
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:50,830
I think he'd be a bit pissed
off if you didn't invite him.

842
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:53,750
~ Oh, dear.
~ Why aren't we inviting him?

843
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:56,710
I was joking.

844
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:58,710
Course we're inviting him.

845
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:01,310
She doesn't like him.
She's jealous of him.

846
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:03,150
Why am I jealous of him?

847
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:05,710
Being so successful and nice.

848
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:06,990
Yeah, whatever.

849
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:10,670
He knows about t'wedding, anyway. cos I've
texted him and told him. And Grandad.

850
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:14,040
I think Grandad were a bit bemused about
how come you'd not told him yourself.

851
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:27,990
Don't you like him? Gary.

852
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:29,790
Course I like him!

853
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:32,870
Yeah, but what, then? There's summat.

854
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:35,720
I don't know. I don't know.

855
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:38,830
I like her.

856
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:41,950
~ Felicity.
~ She's round the flaming twist.

857
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,760
She's funny.

858
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:48,260
What, then?

859
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:52,310
SHE SIGHS

860
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:57,870
He's a good man, me dad.
He made a mistake,

861
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:01,440
he did something he shouldn't
have, but I can't crucify him.

862
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:06,880
And Gary's great. What a lovely
man. How lucky are we?

863
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:11,820
But... I dunno.

864
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:19,150
Me dad's so fascinated by him,

865
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:25,710
like he's the successful, suave,
wunderkind he should've always had.

866
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:28,550
Rather than the feckless
knob that he ended up with.

867
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:32,590
~ You dad's not said that.
~ Course he's not said it.

868
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:35,940
Is that why you didn't
text your dad either?

869
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:41,640
Well, if it's any consolation.
I think you're perfect.

870
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:50,630
I'd better ring him.

871
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:52,550
See what he wants.

872
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,270
~ Late! Sorry.
~ That's OK.

873
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:05,830
How are you?

874
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:07,880
Can I have some tea?

875
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:12,150
~ Thanks for meeting me.
~ It's nice to see you.

876
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:14,030
Is it?

877
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:16,480
~ Why wouldn't it be?
~ Well...

878
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,470
Alan hasn't rung me for two weeks.

879
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:20,510
~ He's been in Harrogate.
~ Yeah.

880
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:24,950
It's all been pretty
traumatic. For everyone.

881
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:28,360
Sure. But then you didn't
ring me either. Till Sunday.

882
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,670
Well, I've been a bit snowed
under meself as well.

883
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:36,510
Course. Course. It's
just that I'm paranoid.

884
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:38,700
~ Are you?
~ Not normally.

885
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:43,510
How's Raff doing?

886
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:47,590
Really well! He loves it. He's
great, he's such a nice lad.

887
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:48,950
Thank you. He can be.

888
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:52,200
When he's not being a...
cocky little dick.

889
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:58,510
Me and Felicity haven't been
getting on very well lately.

890
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:00,870
~ Really?
~ Sorry, that's...

891
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:03,430
~ No.
~ I mean... it's since all this.

892
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:05,870
So it's probably all my fault.

893
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:07,990
Why? What do you mean?

894
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:10,590
I suddenly...

895
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:12,510
I felt very angry.

896
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:16,630
After we'd been over for
lunch the other Sunday.

897
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:18,230
Why?

898
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:20,020
How's Caroline?

899
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:24,070
She's coping. Why did you feel angry?

900
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:25,990
I don't know why.

901
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:28,470
~ It's not...
~ Angry with...?

902
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:33,070
Everything. With... Why
my parents never told me.

903
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:36,070
You know, that's a conversation that
I can never have with them now.

904
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:38,510
Yeah, I know. I understand.
I do understand.

905
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:39,950
Because I feel the same about...

906
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,790
And I'm remembering things. Things
that happened in the past.

907
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:47,350
And I'm wondering whether they did
think more about our Adam - my brother
- than they did about me.

908
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:50,790
~ He's younger than erm...?
~ Yeah! Yeah, and my dad
was his dad, his proper dad.

909
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:55,190
And I've never, NEVER thought
like this before.

910
00:51:55,240 --> 00:52:00,870
I've never felt angry or jealous
before. Well, not like this.

911
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:02,670
I know.

912
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:06,190
It changes the past. Almost.
Even though it doesn't.

913
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:11,750
But it - yeah. It colours the past.
And yeah, that's difficult.

914
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:13,830
~ But...
~ Then no-one... nobody rings me up.

915
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:15,270
After that Sunday,

916
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:17,710
so I've got all this shit in
my head about my real parents,

917
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:21,190
and I'm thinking, "Oh, and now he doesn't
really want to get to know me".

918
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:24,710
~ No, that's...
~ But I am the one who always
has to do the ringing up.

919
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:28,630
No. Gary. Honestly. You're
reading too much into it.

920
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:30,110
It's been an odd few weeks.

921
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:32,300
You're getting married!

922
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:34,670
Yeah!

923
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:37,230
You are invited!

924
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:38,620
Really?

925
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:42,910
Just ring me dad up if you're worried
you've not heard from him!

926
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:46,070
~ Yeah, but I...
~ What?
~ I daren't.

927
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:48,870
Daren't? You're Gary Jackson!

928
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:50,870
That doesn't mean anything!

929
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:54,030
I don't want to end up feeling like
I'm being a nuisance all the time!

930
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:56,820
My dad would never think like that.

931
00:52:57,480 --> 00:52:58,950
Your dad?

932
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:03,590
Yeah. My dad, your dad. Whatever.

933
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:05,030
He is interested in me, isn't he?

934
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:08,070
Yes! Absolutely! He thinks
you're fantastic!

935
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:10,270
And Celia liked me.

936
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:13,230
~ She loved you.
~ Sorry.

937
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:15,790
~ Don't...
~ I'm not like this. This - it's just...

938
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:20,430
it's just been such a shock,
Gillian. And... It's like...

939
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:22,710
it's only just sunk in.
Properly. All the...

940
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:25,870
~ I know.
~ Implications.
~ I know. I do know.

941
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:28,870
Sorry. I get - sorry
- I get obsessed.

942
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:32,720
And a little bit weird about
stuff. That's just me!

943
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:38,790
~ Is she even bringing me some tea?
~ Calm down.

944
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:41,580
~ Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
~ Calm down.

945
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:58,070
I'm going to e-mail you
the second I'm home.

946
00:53:58,120 --> 00:53:59,550
Yes. Please do.

947
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:02,150
~ And I'm going to be back for the summer.
~ Good.

948
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:05,430
For two whole weeks!

949
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:08,480
And I'm going to bring
you so much stuff!

950
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:12,680
And then you and Mom -

951
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:16,590
this Mom - are going to visit me.

952
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:18,710
~ We are.
~ That's right.

953
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:21,680
Celia.

954
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:25,710
You have a safe journey.

955
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:27,030
Alan.

956
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:32,110
You've both been so kind.

957
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:35,390
You keep in touch. With us
two, as well as these two.

958
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:37,880
I will, of course I will.

959
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:13,520
~ Y'all right, love?
~ Yup.

960
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:25,070
Dr Elliot?

961
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:26,870
Holly?

962
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:29,670
Is this...? This is 46 Conway Drive.

963
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:31,510
I'm looking for a Dr McKenzie-Dawson.

964
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:34,110
~ Oh. Yes. That's me.
~ Is it?

965
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:36,430
Yes... I - I got married.

966
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:41,390
Gosh. Well. The agency sent me.

967
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:45,230
~ And I'm ten minutes early, but I
can go away and come back if you like.
~ No, no, don't do that.

968
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:48,750
~ But... you went off to
Sussex to read sociology.
~ I dropped out!

969
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:50,990
The surname - when the agency
rang... That wasn't...

970
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:53,470
~ I didn't...
~ I dropped out and I got married too!

971
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:55,670
And now I'm a nanny. I never
wanted to go to Sussex.

972
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:58,270
It was my parents.
Bless them. And you!

973
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:00,070
So ambitious for us all!

974
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:03,470
But all I ever really wanted to do was
this. And now that's what I am doing!

975
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:06,710
And I couldn't be happier, honestly.

976
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:09,990
Holly. This is my mother.
And this is my stepfather.

977
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:12,350
~ How do you do?
~ Celia.

978
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:14,270
Alan. Hello.

979
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:16,390
And this is Flora.

980
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:20,470
Hello, Flora! My goodness
me, aren't you pretty?

981
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:22,270
What beautiful skin.

982
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:23,990
I'm not her biological mother.

983
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:27,630
Did, erm... did the agency
explain my situation to you?

984
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:29,920
No. Not - not entirely.

985
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:33,110
Would you like some tea?

986
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:34,870
I'd love some tea.

987
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:37,470
~ Do you want to come inside?
~ Thank you.

988
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:39,470
What a gorgeous house!

989
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:41,230
Gosh, look at those irises.

990
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:43,590
That's my absolute number
one favourite colour.

991
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:45,990
Wow. Is that your car?

992
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:47,390
No, it's...

993
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:48,710
Really? Good for you!

994
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:51,590
If I could choose a car, I think
I'd choose that one. Seriously.

995
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:54,880
Except I'd be scared to drive it.
I think I'd just rather look at it.

996
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:58,240
Gosh, it's a nice hallway...

997
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:01,590
Today we might take a
picnic to Knaresborough.

998
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:04,230
We've just had a phone call
from the police in Bradford.

999
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:06,750
~ They've got Flora.
~ The police've got Flora?

1000
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:08,230
I told you I didn't want a baby.

1001
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:09,630
I said I didn't want a baby.

1002
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:12,870
I'm lying. Saying
I never told anyone.

1003
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:14,990
~ Lawrence, this is Greg.
~ Hi.

1004
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:16,470
Bye.

1005
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:18,550
It's less than six
weeks since Kate died.

1006
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:21,150
~ Well.
~ Are you seriously asking me that question?

1007
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:24,040
Then the other thing... Oh, you're
going to take this the wrong way.
