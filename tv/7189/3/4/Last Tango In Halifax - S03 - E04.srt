这是……这取决于你。

14
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:33,590
这不是我们俩的事吗?~是的。当然可以。但是你……你知道的,
~ Isn't it up to both of us? ~ Yes. Of course. But you're... You know,

所以你不喜欢它。

不，我知道，就像我说的。我越来越喜欢它了。这很适合她。
No, I do, like I say. It's growing on me. It suits her.

26
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,830
现在很适合她，但她14岁时还适合吗
Well, it suits her now, but will it suit her when she's 14

27
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,510
然后得到意见。

28
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,830
我真的很喜欢它。~好吧，这才是最重要的。
~ I really like it. ~ Well, then, that's all that matters.

29
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,910
你只是说说而已。我不会那样做的。

00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,950
如果我觉得这真的很可恶，我就会这么说。

35
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,430
不，我没有。
No, I haven't.

36
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:23,540
别那样跟我说话。男人就是这么说话的。
Don't talk to me like that. That's how men talk.

37
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,710
~所以你喜欢格蕾丝?~我喜欢弗洛拉。

她把他想得神魂颠倒，

You didn't want her to have a baby and now you're the one left with it.

00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,030
看得出来你得到了很多帮助和支持，
I can see you've got a lot of help and support,

147
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,470
但是，如果你只是想找人照顾她一会儿或者……
but, if you just wanted someone to look after her for a bit or...

148
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:02,510
就像我说的，在其他情况下
And, as I say, under any other circumstances

149
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,430
我不会提供的。我早就退让了。
I wouldn't be offering. I'd have backed off.

150
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,590
我就不会在这里了。这是约定，我很清楚，
I wouldn't even be here. That was the deal and I'm aware of that,

151
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,910
但是，如果有什么，
but, if ever there was anything,

152
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:14,070
我很灵活，我是自由职业者，我可以在任何地方工作，
I'm flexible, I'm self-employed, I can work anywhere,

153
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,590
所以我不想让你觉得你不能开口
so I wouldn't want you to feel like you couldn't ask

154
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,200
或者它会带来不便，因为很可能它不会带来不便。
or that it'd be inconvenient, because chances are it wouldn't be.

155
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,560
~就这些。~好吧。
~ That's all. ~ OK.

156
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,550
好的，谢谢你。
Well, thank you.

157
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,990
有你…你有我的电话号码吗?
Have you... Have you got my number?

158
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,310
它……
It...

159
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,350
会发到凯特的手机上。
It'll be on Kate's phone.

160
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,240
嗯…
Well...

161
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,030
她在厨房里
She's in the kitchen

162
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:46,790
和我妈妈或者凯特的妈妈一起，如果你愿意的话
with my mum or Kate's mum if you want to

163
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,710
看看她。
have a look at her.

164
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:51,350
我不该问的。
I shouldn't have asked.

165
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,140
这取决于你。
It's up to you.

166
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,840
好的。
OK.

167
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:03,590
问题是，她和凯特的妈妈在一起
Thing is, she's with Kate's mother

168
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:07,160
凯特的妈妈觉得我是个白痴
and Kate's mother thinks I'm an idiot.

169
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,310
一茶匙发酵粉，一勺牛奶，
A teaspoonful of baking powder, a splash of milk,

170
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:15,670
一滴香草精就万事大吉了。
a drop of vanilla essence and bob's your uncle.

171
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,270
妈妈。Ginika。
Mum. Ginika.

172
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,280
我是格雷格。~你好。
~ This is Greg. ~ Hi.

173
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,270
格雷格的…
Greg's the...

174
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,390
植物的生物……
Flora's biological...

175
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,470
你好，麦肯齐太太。
Hi, Mrs McKenzie.

176
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:31,670
我已经二十年不做麦肯齐太太了，格雷格。
I haven't been Mrs McKenzie in 20 years, Greg.

177
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,520
当然可以。离婚了。天啊。
Of course. Divorced. Gosh.

178
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,350
格雷格想……
Greg wanted to...

179
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,750
~扶着她的头。~是的。
~ Support her head. ~ Yeah.

180
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,560
是的。
Yeah.

181
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,920
好的。
OK.

182
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,990
你看到艾伦了吗?
Have you seen Alan?

183
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,390
艾伦吗?
Alan?

184
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,390
他到花园里去和我的数学主任抽烟了。
He went into the garden to have a cigarette with my Head of Maths.

185
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,590
艾伦不抽烟。
Alan doesn't smoke.

186
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:13,430
~没有。我不知道克里斯也有。你就让他这么做了?
~ No. I didn't know Chris did either. ~ And you just let him?

187
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,750
他有心脏病。
He has a heart condition.

188
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,360
哇。
Wow.

189
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:26,190
当然，从那以后他们修建了M6收费公路，
Course they've built the M6 toll road since then,

190
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,990
所以我不知道这样是否更有效率。
so I've no idea if that's any more efficient.

191
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,510
哦,狗屎!
Oh, shit!

192
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,670
你在抽烟吗?~没有。
~ Are you smoking? ~ No.

193
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,230
你在抽烟。~我没有。
~ You were smoking. ~ I weren't.

194
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,790
不然你为什么还站在外面下毛毛雨?
Why else would you be standing out here in the drizzle?

195
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,310
我只是…
I just...

196
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,630
你知道他有心脏病吗?
Did you know he has a heart condition?

197
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,070
我是克里斯。~你好。
~ This is Chris. ~ Hi.

198
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,790
你以为数学家会更清楚。
You'd think a mathematician would know better.

199
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,030
我可以解雇你。
I could have you sacked.

200
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,870
给一个有心脏病的人香烟。
Giving cigarettes to a man with a heart condition.

201
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,550
是的，我是卡罗琳的妈妈。
Yes, I'm Caroline's mother.

202
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,510
只有一个。
It were only the one.

203
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:02,270
我不知道你抽烟。~我不喜欢。我以前是这样。
~ I didn't know you smoked. ~ I don't. I used to.

204
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,230
我现在只是喜欢偶尔来一次。每一个…
I just like the very occasional one now. Every...

205
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:08,590
我上次吃的是千禧年的。那是什么时候的事?
Look, last one I had were millennium. Now, when were that?

206
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:11,710
我以为我认识你。~你有。
~ I thought I knew you. ~ You do.

207
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,190
女性,香烟……
Women, cigarettes...

208
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,110
如果我开始抽烟，你觉得怎么样?~我不会。
~ How would you like it if I started smoking? ~ I wouldn't.

209
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,430
哦，那我想我会的。
Oh, then I think I might.

210
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:22,190
我能抽根烟吗，克里斯?~肯定。
~ Can I have a cigarette, Chris? ~ Sure.

211
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,350
看看你喜欢不喜欢。
See how you like it.

212
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:26,110
你不需要抽烟来证明你的观点。
You don't have to smoke a cigarette to prove a point.

213
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,110
在葬礼上也一样。
And at a funeral, as well.

214
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,700
你打算让它掉下去吗?
Are you going to let this drop?

215
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,990
好了。
There you go.

216
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,350
我想我还是回去吧。
I think I might go back inside.

217
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:39,470
别让我阻止你。我不想要你的香烟。
Don't let me stop you. I don't want your cigarettes.

218
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,520
好吧，我…
Right, well, I'll...

219
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:51,390
嘿，让我露脸!~你想要出现!
~ 'Ere, showing me up! ~ You want showing up!

220
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,270
那只是因为我在乎你。
It's only because I care about you.

221
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:57,230
这不过是想呼吸点新鲜空气的借口。
It were only an excuse to get a bit of fresh air.

222
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,910
说真的，你抽烟吗?
Seriously, do you smoke?

223
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,100
不!
No!

224
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,400
不。
No.

225
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,460
你想吃果子露吗?
Do you fancy a sherbet?

226
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,150
你没事吧?
You all right?

227
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,550
这些人有一半我都不认识。
I don't know who half these people are.

228
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,510
他们没有参加婚礼。
They weren't at the wedding.

229
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:27,030
请注意，我们没有邀请很多人来参加婚礼。~没有。
~ Mind you, we didn't invite very many people to the wedding. ~ No.

230
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:30,830
嗯，我们非正式地邀请了，但大多数人都来不了。
Well, we did, unofficially, but most of them couldn't come.

231
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,550
不，我很抱歉。我们很忙。
No, well, I'm sorry. We were busy.

232
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,830
不管。这都是最后一刻才决定的。
No matter. It was all a bit last minute.

233
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,420
我们这么做是为了她，真的。
We only did it for her, really.

234
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,910
他是孩子的父亲。
He's the father.

235
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,390
生父。
The biological father.

236
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:47,350
吉妮卡是祖母。
And Ginika's the grandmother.

237
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,590
生物……
The biological...

238
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,180
凯特的妈妈。
Kate's mum.

239
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,070
其实我什么都不是。
And I'm not actually anything.

240
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,390
她得了疝气。天啊，你不需要那个。
~ She's got colic. ~ Jesus, you don't need that.

241
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,870
她现在看起来还好。
She seems OK at the minute.

242
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,260
你等到6点钟。
You wait till six o' clock.

243
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,670
就像按开关一样
It's like flicking a switch

244
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:13,430
然后一直持续到
and then it can go on till about

245
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:16,480
凌晨三点。这是可怕的。这就像……
three o'clock in the morning. It's terrible. It's like...

246
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:27,950
她好像在哭她妈妈，我知道她是疝气，
It's like she's crying for her mother, and I know it's colic,

247
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,470
但这就是我的感觉。
but that's what it feels like.

248
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,040
婴儿的哭声
BABY CRIES

249
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,990
Shush-shush-shush。
Shush-shush-shush.

250
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,190
它只会哭泣。
All it does is cry.

251
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,430
一直持续到凌晨三四点钟，
It goes on till three or four o'clock in the morning,

252
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,990
除此之外你什么都做不了。
and you can't do anything else.

253
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,670
你不能把注意力集中在其他事情上，这很荒谬。
You can't concentrate on anything else and it's ridiculous.

254
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,990
~是的，不，这是…一定是。是啊，对妈妈来说更糟。
~ Yeah, no, it's... It must be. ~ Yeah, well, it's worse for Mum.

255
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,550
不，不是。她想要。
No, it isn't. She wanted it.

256
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,430
我都不知道这是干什么用的。它是做什么的?
I don't even know what it's for. What does it do?

257
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,670
它只是哭泣和拉屎。
It just cries and shits.

258
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,950
~ Oi !Oi !那就行了。
~ Oi! Oi! ~ That'll do.

259
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,190
这都不是我们的，而你又不在这里，所以闭嘴。
It's not even ours, and you're not even here, so shut up.

260
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:04,190
是啊，你已经长大了，可以开始帮助她，支持她了，
Yeah, and you're old enough to start trying to help her and support her,

261
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,430
而不是像个以自我为中心的小混蛋
instead of behaving like a self-centred little dick

262
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,430
~一直都是。滚开。哦，你滚开。
~ all the time. ~ Piss off. ~ Oh, you piss off.

263
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,350
停止它!
Stop it!

264
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:13,700
没有你，妈妈的事已经够多了……
Mum's got enough on her plate without you...

265
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,550
我以为你在躺着呢。
I thought you were having a lie down.

266
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:20,190
是的，但是我睡不着，所以…~她很好!她很好!
~ Yeah, but I couldn't sleep, so... ~ She's fine! She's fine!

267
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,470
我要带她出去呼吸点新鲜空气。
I'm just going to take her out for a bit of fresh air.

268
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:26,750
不，你不需要。~我想!我们相爱了。我们保税。
~ No, you don't have to. ~ I want to! We're in love. We've bonded.

269
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,310
手了。
Hands off.

270
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:32,070
开车。这对疝气宝宝有好处。
Driving. That's meant to be good for colicky babies.

271
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,230
她有什么东西可以裹起来吗?
Has she got something I can wrap her up in?

272
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:37,270
是的，她有一件可爱的粉色丝绒小外套和一顶相配的帽子
Yes, she's got a lovely little pink velour coat and a matching hat

273
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,950
艾伦和我给她买的
that Alan and me bought her.

274
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,070
是振动和声音。
It's the vibration and the sound.

275
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,670
就像在子宫里一样。
It's like being in the womb.

276
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,600
显然，这都是DH劳伦斯的风格。
Obviously, it's all very DH Lawrence.

277
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,510
婴儿车在走廊里，亲爱的，还有条毯子。
The pushchair's in the hall, love, and there's a blanket.

278
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,470
我一个小时左右回来。
I'll be an hour or so.

279
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,860
~你休息一下。~谢谢。
~ You get some rest. ~ Thanks.

280
00:15:56,840 --> 00:16:00,510
我得坐下了。
I'm going to have to sit down.

281
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,870
我已经尽力了。
I've done what I can.

282
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,390
艾伦，你进去吧。我给你拿点茶来。
Oh, Alan, you go in there. I'll bring you some tea.

283
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,670
你还好吗，亲爱的?
Are you all right, love?

284
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,870
是的。
Yeah.

285
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,190
是的。
Yeah.

286
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,860
凯特的妈妈在哪里?
Where's Kate's mum?

287
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,640
~我想她也在躺着休息。她还好吗?
~ She's having a lie down, as well, I think. ~ Is she all right?

288
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,560
不，她当然不是。这是不可能发生的，不是吗?
No, of course she's not. It's not meant to happen, is it?

289
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:32,100
你的一个孩子走在你前面。
One of your children going before you.

290
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,830
他无法忍受哭泣。
He can't stand it, the crying.

291
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,620
我也不能。
I can't either.

292
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,470
我们还知道发生了什么吗
Do we know any more about what's happened

293
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,270
对那些把她撞倒的白痴吗?
to the idiots that knocked her down?

294
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,030
我没告诉你吗?
Oh, did I not tell you?

295
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,030
你说有偷车的指控，
Well, you said there were charges of car theft,

296
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,630
鲁莽驾驶和过失杀人。
reckless driving and manslaughter.

297
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,390
他们被保释，
They were released on bail,

298
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:58,670
~前天。~不!
~ day before yesterday. ~ No!

299
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,000
当我说我们应该恢复绞刑时，你嘲笑我。
And you laugh at me when I say we should bring back hanging.

300
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08,920
我去看看劳伦斯怎么样了。
I'll go and see if Lawrence is all right.

301
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,710
你去和艾伦一起坐进去。
You go and sit down in there with Alan.

302
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:15,760
我给你们俩拿点茶来。你确定?
~ I'll bring you both some tea. ~ You sure?

303
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:19,630
是的，继续。滚吧。
Yeah, go on. Off you pop.

304
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,790
一会儿见。
See you in a bit.

305
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:28,430
那里有一条茶巾。
There's a tea towel there.

306
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,640
是的。事实上，我可能也会出去呼吸点新鲜空气。
Yeah. Actually, I might pop out and get a bit of fresh air, as well.

307
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,000
你是透明的。你知道的，不是吗?
You're transparent. You do know that, don't you?

308
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,550
妈妈在泡茶。
Mum's making the tea.

309
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,190
她撞见我抽烟。
She caught me smoking.

310
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,870
啊，那是我的错。
Ah, that was my fault.

311
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:51,060
所以我又有麻烦了。
So I'm in bother again.

312
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:54,590
我很高兴你克服了……
I'm glad you got over that...

313
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,140
. .另一件事。
.. other thing.

314
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,390
我不太确定我们有。
I'm not entirely sure we have.

315
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:05,190
我想它被搁置了。
I think it's been put on hold.

316
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:09,030
那里没有别的骷髅了，是吗，
And there are no other skeletons, are there,

317
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,430
在橱柜里?
in the cupboard?

318
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,510
我知道这不关我的事，但她是我妈妈。
I know it's none of my business, but she's my mum.

319
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,670
不。
No.

320
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:19,040
没有骷髅了。我不像你爸爸。
No more skeletons. I weren't like your dad.

321
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:22,590
好吧,
Well,

322
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,630
除了,
except,

323
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,910
~我想知道我是不是。你是什么意思?
~ I wonder if I were. ~ What do you mean?

324
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,200
不是……不是不同的女人，只是…
Not... Not different women, just...

325
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,720
我确实爱过艾琳……
I did love Eileen...

326
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,670
. .但随后，一个缓慢的、初见端倪的意识出现了
.. but, then, a slow, dawning realisation

327
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:40,830
你已经接受了这样的事情
that you've settled for summat that

328
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:45,080
你一直都知道这不是你想要的。
you knew all along weren't really what you wanted.

329
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,190
当她怀上吉莉安的时候，
When she became pregnant with Gillian,

330
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:53,310
我以为这是我想要的，但是，
I thought it were what I wanted, but,

331
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,470
事实上，它吓到我了。
actually, it frightened me.

332
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:59,150
我很高兴，但是
Delighted me, but

333
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,080
吓到我了，“就这样了吗?”
frightened me, like, "Is this it?"

334
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,430
我很抱歉。我听起来像是在找借口，
I'm sorry. I'm sounding like I'm making excuses,

335
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,280
但是，没有，再也没有发生过，所以…
but, no, it never happened again, so...

336
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,550
对不起。对不起。
Sorry. Sorry.

337
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:17,470
我不该说这些的。不是现在。
I shouldn't have started talking about that. Not now.

338
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,150
我爸爸也不全是坏人。
He wasn't all bad, my dad.

339
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,430
不。
No.

340
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,390
不。
No.

341
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:26,350
好吧，谁想当妈妈?
Right, who wants to be mother?

342
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,670
你做的事情。
You do.

343
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,390
我撞见他抽烟。我告诉过你吗?
I caught him smoking. Did I tell you?

344
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,470
是的，是我……我很抱歉。
Yes, it was me that... I'm sorry.

345
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,510
你为什么向他道歉?
What're you apologising to him for?

346
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:40,630
他是76年!如果他连一小根烟都不能抽
He's 76! If he can't have one single tiny cigarette

347
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:43,390
不会让你觉得自己像个六岁小孩。
without being made to feel like a six-year-old.

348
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,470
接下来我们会发现他一直在为俄罗斯人做间谍。
We'll find out he's been spying for the Russians next.

349
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:49,550
我们都有缺点，不是吗?
Well, we've all got our shortcomings, haven't we?

350
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,350
他抽烟，你看每日邮报。
He smokes, you read the Daily Mail.

351
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,350
我不抽烟!
I don't smoke!

352
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,870
只在电视上播放。
Only for the telly page.

353
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:58,960
当然，你很完美，不是吗?~伊什。
~ Of course, you're perfect, aren't you. ~ Ish.

354
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,340
给你，亲爱的。
There you go, love.

355
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,590
约翰去找吉莉安了。
John's gone after Gillian.

356
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,360
我告诉他，我说"你是透明的"
I told him, I said, "You're transparent."

357
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,830
对不起。嗨。
Sorry. Hi.

358
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,230
是的，我知道。
Yeah, I know.

359
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:21,640
可预测、无聊、透明。
Predictable, boring, transparent.

360
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,870
最近怎么样?~好。
~ How're things? ~ Fine.

361
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,520
好。好。
Good. Good.

362
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,950
我想…
I wanted to...

363
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:33,310
我知道这很难
Look, I know this is difficult,

364
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,390
尴尬的,
it's awkward,

365
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,840
但是，你知道，我们是成年人。
but, you know, we're adults.

366
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,830
~我们可以…我和Robbie要结婚了。
~ We can... ~ Me and Robbie's getting married.

367
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,950
我告诉过你他邀请过我，现在我答应了。
I told you he'd asked me, and now I've said yes.

368
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,670
我两周前就答应了
I said yes two weeks ago,

369
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,590
只是我们还没告诉任何人。
only we've not told anyone yet.

370
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:51,510
我们只是想等到葬礼结束后再正式宣布。
We were just waiting until after the funeral to announce it properly.

371
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:54,350
所以你是第一个知道的。
So you're the first to know.

372
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,350
好的。好吧,这是
OK. Well, that's

373
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,670
好。
good.

374
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,750
这是……
That's...

375
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:01,910
的东西……
The thing...

376
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:05,390
我想说的是，考虑到凯特的事，
The thing I wanted to say was that, given what's happened with Kate,

377
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,910
我想她需要我在这里。
I think she needs me here.

378
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,910
卡洛琳。
Caroline.

379
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:13,590
我觉得她可能需要我陪着劳伦斯，
I think she needs me here for Lawrence, probably,

380
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:16,390
所以我……很显然……
so I... Obviously...

381
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:20,790
我向你提供农场的经济援助，就像我做的那样，
Me offering you financial help with the farm, as I did,

382
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,830
~可能有些事我不能……很好。
~ might be something that I can't... ~ That's fine.

383
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,480
~不能再做了。很好。
~ Can't do any more. ~ That's fine.

384
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,920
~不过，如果你要嫁给Robbie…是的，很好。
~ Still, if you're marrying Robbie... ~ Yes, it's fine.

385
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,630
你确定他…~是的。
~ Are you sure he's... ~ Yes.

386
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:39,350
~ . .你真的想要什么?是的，我是。
~ .. really what you want? ~ Yes, I am.

387
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,670
好。
Good.

388
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,790
反正我也没把它当回事。~不是吗?
~ I didn't take it very seriously anyway. ~ No?

389
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,680
不。好。
No. Good.

390
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,470
好了，这就是我想说的。为某事感谢~肯定。
~ Well, that's all I wanted to say. Thank you for... ~ Sure.

391
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,720
~ . .如此善解人意。没有问题。
~ .. being so understanding. ~ It's no problem.

392
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,510
我确实认为这是个错误。
I do think it's a mistake.

393
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,900
Robbie。
Robbie.

394
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,880
我不在乎你怎么想。~他太……
~ I don't care what you think. ~ He's so...

395
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,870
不。
No.

396
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,230
不，我想你不知道。
No, I don't suppose you do.

397
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:16,110
我们还没告诉任何人，我们结婚的事。
We haven't told anyone, yet, about us getting married.

398
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,030
和凯特在一起。
What with Kate.

399
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,350
所以不要再重复了。
So don't go repeating it.

400
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,640
门打开
DOOR OPENS

401
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,590
信不信由你，她睡着了。
She's asleep, believe it or not.

402
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,310
我不知道要多久。
I don't know how long for.

403
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,310
我把她留在婴儿车里了。
I've left her in her pram.

404
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,700
谢谢。
Thanks.

405
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,510
她是个可爱的孩子。
She's a sweet baby.

406
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:15,670
我是说，当她不尖叫的时候…
I mean, when she's not screaming blue mur...

407
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,860
尖叫得要命。
Screaming her head off.

408
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,550
你不这么认为吗?
Do you not think?

409
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:23,400
我想我更喜欢他们15岁左右的样子。
I think I prefer them when they get to be about 15.

410
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,030
大家都走了吗?
Has everyone gone?

411
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,390
妈妈和艾伦在隔壁。
Mum and Alan are next door.

412
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:30,190
他们会在电视机前睡觉，凯特的妈妈在床上。
They'll be asleep in front of the telly and Kate's mum's in bed.

413
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,780
可怜的女人。
Poor woman.

414
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,870
毫米。
Mm.

415
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,390
可怜的你。
Poor you.

416
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:39,120
~我最好自己去录。~肯定。
~ I'd better be making tracks myself. ~ Sure.

417
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:46,680
听着，我想跟你说点事。
Listen, I wanted to talk to you about something.

418
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,070
现在可能不是时候
Now might not be the time,

419
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,990
但我不想让你从我爸爸或你妈妈那里听到
but I don't want you to hear it from my dad or your mum

420
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:55,040
你可能会误解别人的意思。~好吧。
~ and get the wrong end of the stick. ~ OK.

421
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,140
我开始…
I've started...

422
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,510
我又和Robbie约会了
I've been seeing Robbie again,

423
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:16,030
我知道。我知道你觉得这不好
and I know. I know you think that's bad,

424
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,830
考虑到……
given what...

425
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,990
我告诉你的事
The thing I told you,

426
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:24,190
但他对我有好处，他是我的真命天子，他让我不再当傻瓜，
but he's good for me, he's right for me, he stops me being a pillock,

427
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:27,600
现在他向我求婚，我答应了
and now he's asked me to marry him and I've said yes.

428
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,510
卡洛琳。
Caroline.

429
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,230
卡洛琳。
Caroline.

430
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,230
卡洛琳。
Caroline.

431
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:44,230
我现在不能想那件事。~不，我知道。我只是…
~ I can't think about that now. ~ No, I know. I just...

432
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:47,560
就像我说的，我不想让你从别人那里听到。
Like I said, I didn't want you hearing it from anyone else.

433
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:51,070
你脑子里在想什么?
What's going through your head?

434
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,510
什么吗?
Anything?

435
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:57,030
我不知道。如果你能接受，那是你的事。
I don't know. I guess if you can live with it that's your business.

436
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,350
你能吗?
Can you?

437

和某人住在一起，和某人睡觉，了解你
Live with someone, sleep with someone, knowing you

440
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,870
谋杀了他的兄弟?

441
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:10,390
我想我做不到。我想这是我应该避免的。
I don't think I could. I think it's just something I'd avoid.

442
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:14,270
艾迪让我受够了。
I had a lot to put up with with Eddie.

443
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,920
我做了…
I did exp...

444
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:17,830
我确实告诉过你。
I did tell you that.

445
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:18,950
是的，我知道。
Yes, I know.

他喜欢我。
He likes me.

448
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,310
他爱我。
He loves me.

449
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:28,430
我应该嫁的是他
It's him I should've married,

450
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,750
那么多年以前，这一切都不可能…
all those years ago, and none of this would ever've...

451
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:33,390
对不起，我现在不能考虑这个问题。
I'm sorry, I can't think about it now.

452
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,190
不。确定。
No. Sure.

453
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,870
你知道吗，那天晚上，你就是那个，
You know, you were the one, that night,

454
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:40,310
说这就是为什么你和罗比永远不可能是个好主意。
saying that's why it could never be a good idea, you and Robbie.

455
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:42,590
我第二天说的话，我只是同意你的观点。
What I said the next day, I was just agreeing with you.

456
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,030
我不记得了。
I have no memory of that.

457
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:48,110
没有，但是
Well, no, but

458
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,310
你所做的。
you did.

459
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:52,310
是啊，他邀请我了，我答应了。
Yeah, well, he's asked me and I've said yes.

460
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:54,750
我不能……我不能再让他失望了。
I can't... I can't let him down again.

461
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,670
我记得我们说过要假装的
I thought we said we were going to pretend

462
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,870
你从没跟我说过埃迪的事。
you never told me about Eddie.

463
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,270
是的。是的，我们做到了。
Yeah. Yeah, we did.

464
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,120
那好吧。

~对吧。~所以…
~ Right. ~ So...

00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:09,200
你喜欢做什么就做什么。你做你觉得舒服的事。
You do what you like. You do what you feel comfortable with.

467
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,600
好像我需要你的许可似的。
Like I need your permission.

468
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,240
婴儿的哭声

473
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:19,270
卡罗琳怎么样?
How was Caroline?

474

安静。累了。
Quiet. Tired.

475
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:26,470
我不知道你为什么不让我跟你一起去。
I don't know why you wouldn't let me come with you.

476
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,480
可爱的小宝贝。
Sweet little baby.

477
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,280
如此悲伤，如此令人心碎。
So sad, so heartbreaking.

478
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:38,470
那个没用的油乎乎的家伙在那儿吗?
Was that feckless streak of oily shite there?

479
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:41,070
哦,约翰。对，对，对。
Oh, John. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

480
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,790
所以，还好你没去。
So, probably good job you weren't there.

481
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,350
你跟他谈过了吗?
Did you talk to him?

482
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,470
不。
No.

483
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,430
没有必要了。
No longer than necessary.

484
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:52,310
你能想象去找你前妻的女朋友…

合作伙伴的葬礼吗?

486
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:56,510
他只是……他没有……
He's just... He's got no...

487
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,550
我不知道。
I don't know.

礼仪。

489
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,710
是的。你知道中产阶级是什么样的。
Yeah. Well, you know what middle-class people are like.

490
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:06,070
他们闹翻了，离婚了，然后他们还在说话
They fall out and get divorced, then they're still speaking to each other

491
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:09,310
只是为了显示他们都长大了。
just to show how grown-up they all are.

492
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,910
旋钮。

00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,670

但她没事吧?卡洛琳?
But she were all right? Caroline?

00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,960
她得了疝气。
She's got colic.

496
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:18,470
婴儿。菌群。
The baby. Flora.

497
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:21,750
最重要的是，她太累了。
So, on top of everything else, she's just exhausted.

498
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,910
昨天这里一切都好吗?
Was everything all right here, yesterday?

499
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:26,430
是啊，说实话，我没怎么见过他们。
Yeah, I didn't see much of 'em, to be honest.

500
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,910
大家又在加里家呆了一整天
Raff were over at Gary's place all day again

501
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,910
Ellie把Calamity带到她妈妈家。
and Ellie took Calamity to her mother's.

502
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,070
我不知道那是怎么回事。
I've no idea how that went.

503
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:36,870
我看着羊，然后被叫去加班，
I saw to t'sheep, then I got called in for some of overtime,

504
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:39,590
我得去掩护一个3 - 10，所以…
I had to cover a three-ten, so...

505
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,830
我们要告诉他们吗?关于我们?
Are we going to tell 'em? About us?

506
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:44,150
你说过在我葬礼之后。
You said after t'funeral.

507
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,150
是的。
Yep.

508
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,800
所以,今天好吗?
So, today?

509
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,760
今天。
Today.

510
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:57,950
然后我们需要开始思考我们要做的是什么。
Then we need to start thinking about what sort of do we're having.

511
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,630
和在哪里。还有我们邀请的人。
And where. And who we're inviting.

512
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:03,390
你觉得我们的预算是多少?
What sort of budget d'you think we're looking at?

513
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:06,990
因为你知道我有…非常小。
Cos you know I've got... very little.

514
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:09,790
我是说，我爸可能会把手伸进口袋，但是…
I mean, me dad might stick his hand in his pocket, but...

515
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,070
~还有你的Gary。我没有向加里要任何东西。
~ And your Gary. ~ I'm not asking Gary, for anything.

516
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,670
我才认识他五分钟!
I've only known him five minutes!

517
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,260
我在开玩笑!
I'm joking!

518
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,030
拉夫昨天跟他相处得怎么样?
How did Raff get on with him yesterday?

519
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,470
伟大的时间,
Great time,

520
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:24,310
阳光从他的裤子里照出来。
sun shines out of his trousers.

521
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:26,700
加里就是上帝。这是官方的。
Gary is God. It's official.

522
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:31,630
嗯…登记处，不是教堂。
Erm... Registry Office, not church.

523
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:34,470
然后我们就可以在sportsman餐厅吃烤猪了。
Then we can have, like, an hog roast up at t'Sportsman's.

00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,270
~还有乐队。~什么样的乐队?
~ And a band. ~ What sort of band?

527
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:43,260
好吧，反正是个DJ。
Well, a DJ, anyway.

528
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,110
我们会考虑的。~还有蜜月!

更长时间。

我们为什么不买四个呢?

四个星期。一个非常令人兴奋的地方，比如……

当我和你妈妈去度蜜月的时候。

538
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,790

546
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:34,790
你会……吗?~我开玩笑的!

551
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:50,150
哇哇哇!

~给他打电话。我就是这么说的。他以为你和他闹翻了。
~ Rung him. ~ That's what I said. He thinks you've fell out with him.

~ Yeah, you and me ~ Grandad. Why? ~ I don't know. ~ Why's he think that?

558
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,580
我只是传个话。
I'm just passing a message.

559
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:23,830
过几分钟我就过来看看她过得怎么样了。
I'll pop round in a few minutes and see how she's getting on.

560
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,020

564
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,950
“你知道吗?”不，我当然没有!
"Did you know?" No, I damn well didn't!

565
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,000
“她一定是叫那个混蛋滚开了。”
"She must have told that John tosser to eff off."

566
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:51,590
“我希望卡罗琳没事。加里说你为什么不给他打电话。
"I hope Caroline is OK. Gary says why haven't you rang him.

567
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,240

~结婚了。~好吧，好吧!

I will do everything I can for you. OK? But it would really help

570
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:08,070
如果你能在晚上停止哭泣。
if you could stop doing all this crying at night.

571
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:11,600
我知道你忍不住，我也知道你根本不知道我在说什么。
I know you can't help it, and I know you haven't a clue what I'm talking about.

572
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,880
她叹了口气
SHE SIGHS

573
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:20,150
你妈妈会为你高兴的。
Your mum would've been so thrilled with you.

574
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:23,200
用你的每一点一滴。
With every tiny, tiny little bit of you.

575
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,320
对吧,…
Right, well,...

. .我们有很多选择。
.. we've got options.

577
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:35,540
如果我说什么你喜欢的话就打断我。
Just interrupt me if I say anything you like the sound of.

578
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:38,680
一个，这是一个大问题……
One, and this is a big one,...

579
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:42,460
. .我要提前退休。
.. is that I take early retirement.

580
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,630
我可能得把这里卖了，
I'd have to sell this place, probably,

581
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:49,790
但从好的方面来说，我有一笔不小的退休金。
but, on the plus side, I've got a not insubstantial pension going on.

582
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:53,320
我是一个聪明的人。你很快就会习惯的。
I am nothing if not a smart cookie. You'll soon get used to that.

583
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:58,190
这个计划的缺陷是我仍然……
The flaw in that plan is that I am still...

584
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,380
不是没有野心……
not without ambition...

585
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:04,390
. .在过去的职业部门…
.. in the old career department...

586
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:10,060
. .这就引出了第二个选择。
.. which brings me onto option number two.

587
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:15,840
我们要求其他人参与并帮助我们。
We ask other people to get involved and help out.

588
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,440
我的母亲。
My mother.

589
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:24,190
我的母亲。你见过我妈妈吗?
My mother. Have you met my mother?

590
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:29,790
哦，还有约翰。你见过约翰了。好几次了。
Oh, and then there's John. The ex. You have met John. Several times.

591
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:32,950
他就是那天喋喋不休谈论拉迪亚德·吉卜林的人
He's the one who was going on about Rudyard Kipling the other day

592
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,830
当时我正试图精神崩溃。他是个白痴。
when I was trying to have a nervous breakdown. He's an idiot.

593
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:38,390
他不是白痴，他只是个普通人
Well, he's not an idiot, he's just someone

594
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:41,470
他从来都不知道如何成为一个成年人，
who never got the hang of being one of the grown-ups,

595
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:44,560
你可以说这是他魅力的一部分，也可以说不是。
which you could say is part of his charm, or not.

596
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,390
但是,
But,

597
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:51,310
我另外两个孩子小的时候，他和他们相处得很好。
he was very good with my other two when they were little.

598
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,990
好吧，他是又不是。
Well, he was and he wasn't.

599
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:56,240
当然，还有保姆的选择。
And, then, of course, there's always the nanny option.

600
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:00,230
但我知道你妈妈会怎么想。
But I know what your mum'd think about that.

601
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:02,390
这是不可能的。
That's not happening.

602
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,150
是啊，她会讨厌的。
Yeah, she'd hate it.

603
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,470
她会说"这不是计划的一部分"
She'd say, "That was never part of the plan."

604
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:08,990
嗯，它不是。~不，我知道。
~ Well, it wasn't. ~ No, I know.

605
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:13,280
但你不在这里也不是计划的一部分，对吧?
But you not being here wasn't part of the plan either, was it?

606
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,630
她在自言自语。她在跟孩子说话呢，你个笨蛋。
~ She's talking to herself. ~ She's talking to the baby, you knob.

607
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,870
这就是牛津大学教你的语言吗?
Is that the sort of language they teach you at Oxford?

608
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:22,430
嗯，他是个讨厌鬼。你真是个笨蛋。~旋钮。
~ Well, he is a knob. ~ You're a knob. ~ Knob.

609
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:25,790
凯特的妈妈醒了吗?~旋钮。~没见过她。
~ Is Kate's mum up? ~ Knob. ~ Not seen her.

610
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:29,990
它又哭了，一直哭到今天凌晨两三点。
It cried again, till like 20 to three this morning.

611
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,830
你试过用耳塞吗?
Have you tried using earplugs?

612
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,830
~你还能听到!~她!
~ You can still hear it! ~ Her!

613
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:37,270
它甚至不是我们的。他不能再那样说了，奶奶，他会让妈妈难过的。
~ It's not even ours. ~ He's got to stop saying that, Gran, he's going to upset Mum.

614
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:39,870
她不是别人的，亲爱的。它的爸爸是谁?
~ Well, she's no-one else's, love. ~ Who's its father?

615
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:42,910
那是……他昨天在这里。
It was that, erm... He was here yesterday.

616
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,870
~哪一个?~高。白脸。
~ Which one? ~ Tall. Pasty-faced.

617
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:48,430
Ginger-ish。我的胡子有点长了。
Ginger-ish. Got a, like a bit of a beard thing going on.

618
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,870
加文。
Gavin.

619
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,870
~加雷斯。吉尔伯特。~甘道夫?
~ Gareth. Gilbert. ~ Gandalf?

620
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,720
格雷格!格雷格。
Greg! It's Greg.

621
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,430
你绝对想不到他会是凯特的菜。不动。
You'd never think he'd be Kate's sort. Still.

622
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,910
是啊，那他为什么不能接受呢?
Yeah, well, why can't HE take it?

623
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:03,070
天啊，你还真知道怎么让自己受欢迎啊?
God, you really know how to make yourself popular, don't you?

624
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:06,320
有人给你妈妈倒杯茶吗?
Has anybody taken your mother a cup of tea?

625
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,550
敲门
KNOCK AT DOOR

626
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,310
我能进来吗?
Can I come in?

627
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:16,950
你好。
Hello.

628
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,160
婴儿咯咯的笑声
BABY GURGLES

629
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,430
它不会永远持续下去，……
It won't last forever,...

630
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,750
. .感觉就像这样。
.. feeling like this.

631
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:40,140
我知道你现在很难想象。
I know it's hard for you to imagine that just now.

632
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,910
你什么时候有过这种感觉?
When did you ever feel like this?

633
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:47,160
~我爸爸去世的时候没有。~不，不。那是我爸爸去世的时候。
~ Not when my dad died. ~ No, no. It was when MY dad died.

634
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,870
我哭了整整一个星期，
I cried for an entire week,

635
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,510
固体。
solid.

636
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:55,430
我崇拜他走过的土地。
I worshipped the ground he walked on.

637
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:57,710
59岁。
59 years old.

638
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,150
他已经死了……
He's been dead...

639
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,670
47、48年了。
47, 48 years now.

640
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:06,750
1966年,
1966,

641
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,940
你出生的那一年。
the year you were born.

642
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:13,440
我以为我再也笑不出来了。
I thought I would never smile again.

643
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:17,440
然后……你来了。
And then... you came along.

644
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:21,310
你和他长得一模一样。
And you looked just like him.

645
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:24,760
你觉得死了很奇怪吗?
Do you think it's weird, being dead?

646
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:29,000
我们最终都会知道的，不是吗?
Well, we all get to find out eventually, don't we?

647
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:34,070
我很怀疑。
I doubt it.

648
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:36,710
我想一旦你走了，你就走了。
I reckon once you're gone, you're gone.

649
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:40,520
~我觉得留下来的人更奇怪。~毫米。
~ I think it's more weird for the people left behind. ~ Mm.

650
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:46,790
你认为有些人逗留的时间更长吗?
Do you think some people linger longer...

651
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,440
比其他的吗?
than others?

652
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:53,390
我想有时候会有这种感觉。
I suppose it can feel like that sometimes.

653
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:56,830
我觉得这更多的是你的想象，不是吗，
I think it's more in your imagination, isn't it,

654
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,590
诸如此类的事情?
that sort of thing?

655
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:01,190
我忍不住……
I can't help...

656
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:02,920
担心……
worrying...

657
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:08,720
. .想象着她做了什么，不知道什么时候被撞了……
.. imagining what she did and didn't know when she got hit...

658
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,230
. .她的经历，她的想法，
.. what she went through, what she was thinking,

659
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:14,870
不管它有多快。
however quick it was.

660
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:16,550
她一定很害怕
How frightened she must've been,

661
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:19,230
想知道她到底出了什么事。
wondering what the hell was happening to her.

662
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,710
她是一个如此平和的人
She was such a peaceful person,

663
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:25,060
她那么冷静，那么善良，然后……
she was so calm, she was so kind, and then...

664
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:30,080
. .就这样惨死……这太……
.. to die like that so violently... It's just so...

665
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:35,990
这种事绝对不应该发生在她身上。
Not in a million years is that what should've happened to her.

666
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:38,000
这很不公平。
It's very unfair.

667
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:43,280
但我怕，爱情，生活可以很不公平。
But I'm afraid, love, life can be very unfair.

668
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,830
你……
You...

669
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:50,280
这段时间会很艰难。
It'll be tough for a while.

670
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:55,630
但你会从另一边出来的。你会的。
But you'll come out the other side. You will.

671
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,670
最终。
Eventually.

672
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,590
你知道你会的。
You know you will.

673
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,750
因为你……
Cos you're...

674
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:06,670
你有弹性。
You're resilient.

675
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:09,640
~她抽泣~你很聪明。
~ SHE SOBS ~ You're clever.

676
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:15,320
她抽泣
SHE SOBS

677
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,620
哦,甜心。
Oh, sweetheart.

678
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:50,510
你给吉妮卡带茶了吗?
Did you take Ginika some tea?

679
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,670
是的，我做了。她还好吗?
~ Yes, I did. ~ Is she all right?

680
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:56,550
我想是的。
I think so.

681
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:59,270
我一直在考虑其他选择。
I've been thinking about options.

682
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:02,110
我真的不想放弃我的工作，我会怨恨它，
I really don't want to give up my job, I'd resent it,

683
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,550
那对我们俩都不好。
and that wouldn't be good for either of us.

684
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:07,270
我们中的任何一个。会吗?~没有。~会吗?~没有。
~ Any of us. Would it? ~ No. ~ Would it? ~ No.

685
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:11,150
我也不能兼职当班主任，只是……
And I can't go part-time as a head teacher, it's just...

686
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:15,080
~几个月都没有?这对学校不公平。
~ Not even for a few months? ~ It's not fair on the school.

687
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:18,110
那么，凯特要怎么做呢?
Well, what was Kate going to do?

688
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:22,630
嗯，她打算休息一年，然后她会回来兼职。更容易……
Well, she was going to take a year off and then she was going to come back part-time. It's easier...

689
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:28,000
对于教师来说，情况完全不同。问题是……
for teachers, it's completely different. And the thing is...

690
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,990
. .如果我雇保姆，她会不高兴的
.. she'd hate it if I employed a nanny

691
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:36,470
~而弗洛拉那么小。~毫米。
~ whilst Flora's so tiny. ~ Mm.

692
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:39,670
所以，事情是……
So, the thing is...

693
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:42,470
我会尽我所能，亲爱的，为你，
I'll do what I can, love, for you,

694
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:47,310
但是，你知道，我有世界上最好的意志，我76岁了。
but, you know, with the best will in the world, I'm 76.

695
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:49,430
我知道。我不是……
I know. I wasn't...

696
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:54,070
我很抱歉。我没打算让你全职做任何事
I'm sorry. I wasn't going to ask you to do anything full-time

697
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:57,750
但如果我能权衡几个选择
but if I could balance a few options,

698
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:00,670
你，你和艾伦，你能…
could you, you and Alan, could you...

699
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:04,240
我不知道，做一些奇怪的…
I don't know, do the odd...

700
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,950
. .转变?
.. shift?

701
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,470
是的。是的，我们当然可以。
Yes. Yes, of course we could.

702
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:20,670
吉莉安和罗比要结婚了。我们刚收到一条短信。
Gillian and Robbie are getting married. We've just had a text.

703
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,550
是的，我知道，她昨晚告诉我的。
Yes, I know, she told me last night.

704
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:26,350
我觉得他对她来说是件好事。
I think he could be a very good thing for her.

705
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,470
她嫁给了他的兄弟。
She was married to his brother.

706
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:31,760
是啊，也不是没听说过。
Yeah, well, it's not unheard of.

707
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,520
~没有。~是吗?
~ No. ~ Is it?

708
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,830
有什么事吗?
What's up?

709
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:42,510
你不喜欢她，是吗?~你介意吗?!
~ You don't fancy her, do you? ~ Do you MIND?!

710
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:45,910
嗯，我只是…我们是朋友!~我知道。正确的。~伊什。
~ Well, I just... ~ We're friends! ~ I know. Right. ~ Ish.

711
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:48,760
当她不像个傻瓜的时候。
When she's not behaving like a twit.

712
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:54,030
这么小的人都请保姆了。
People do have nannies from being this tiny.

713
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:55,750
是的，我知道。
Yeah, I know.

714
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:01,340
只要找到合适的人就行了。
It'd just be a matter of finding the right person.

715
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,470
~天啊。~直接说不……
~ Gosh. ~ Just say no...

716
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:07,190
~没有。~ . .如果这是个愚蠢的想法。
~ No. ~ .. if it's a stupid idea.

717
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:11,830
~不，是……我知道你没有理由要帮我。
~ No, it's... ~ I know you've got no reason to want to help me.

718
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,790
不,这是……
No, it's...

719
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:16,470
~有趣的。我刚想起来
~ intriguing. ~ It just occurred to me

720
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:20,750
因为在你输了之后你似乎还想参与…
because you seemed to want to be involved after you lost...

721
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,670
是的。
Yeah.

722
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:26,120
~朱蒂丝的，还有……~是的。是的。
~ Judith's, and... ~ Yeah. Yeah.

723
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,040
是的。
Yeah.

724
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:33,310
不，你说得对，这是个蠢主意。
No, you're right, it's a stupid idea.

725
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:36,660
我不知道我为什么会想到这个。算了吧。
I don't know why I thought of it. Forget it.

726
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,750
我可以……
I could...

727
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:41,140
也许可以试着帮你。
try and help you out maybe.

728
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:45,230
一周一个下午。一个小时。左右。
One afternoon a week. For an hour. Or so.

729
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:50,150
然后如果西莉亚每周来几天。或者更多。
And then if Celia did a couple of days a week. Or more.

730
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:53,040
~她76岁了。~肯定。确定。
~ She's 76. ~ Sure. Sure.

731
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,020
这不是……
It's not...

732
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:03,480
这不是凯特想要的。我。是吗?
It's not really what Kate would've wanted. Me. Is it?

733
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:09,200
我是说，很明显，我很乐意偶尔做些奇怪的……但是…
I mean, obviously, I'd be happy to do the occasional, odd... but...

734
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:14,920
实际上，一般来说，我不认为……
Realistically, on a regular basis, I don't think...

735
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:27,150
你还打算在附近买套公寓或别的什么，是吗?
You're still intending to buy a flat or something close by, aren't you?

736
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,070
这样你就能多陪陪劳伦斯了吗?
So you can spend more time with Lawrence?

737
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:32,670
~肯定。确定。你真的开始找了吗?
~ Sure. Sure. ~ Have you actually started looking?

738
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:35,080
嗯…不。
Erm... no.

739
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:39,230
但是我会的
But I will

740
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:41,710
我会帮你的卡洛琳
and I will help you, Caroline.

741
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,750
我会的，我会尽我所能，我会尽可能多地帮助你。
I will, I'll do what I can, I'll help you out as often as I can.

742
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:47,070
但是我认为……
But I think...

743
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:49,470
你必须现实一点。
You've got to be realistic.

744
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:51,430
你受到了沉重的打击
You've been dealt a terrible blow,

745
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:53,110
太可怕了，太……
it's awful, it's...

746
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:56,230
但重点是，
But the point is,

747
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:59,350
你必须看到这是改变人生的
you have to see that this is life-changing

748
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:01,670
你不能假装它不是。
and you can't pretend it isn't.

749
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:05,670
你要么要雇佣一个全职的…
You've either going to have to employ a full-time...

750
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:09,470
一个知道如何照顾这么小的人的合适人选
proper person who knows how to look after people this tiny

751
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:13,080
或者放弃你的工作，至少暂时放弃。
or give up your job, at least temporarily.

752
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:18,160
我不能那样做。我不能放弃我的工作，我会发疯的。
I can't do that. I can't give up my job, I'd go mad.

753
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,630
你要开车送我去车站吗?~肯定。
~ Are you going to drive me to the station? ~ Sure.

754
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:24,750
~我可以…我来做。
~ I can... ~ I'll do it.

755
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:35,350
给我打电话，发短信，告诉我你安全回来了。
Ring me, text me, and let me know you've got back safely.

756
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:37,600
你要照顾好自己。
You look after yourself.

757
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:41,830
再见,宝贝。
Bye-bye, baby.

758
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:47,670
她是你妹妹，你知道的，对吧?你会把她当成你的妹妹。
She's your sister, you know that, don't you? You will think of her as your sister.

759
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:49,640
我当然知道。
Course I do.

760
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:52,630
我当然会。
Course I will.

761
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:57,160
~再见。再见，爱。
~ See you. ~ Bye-bye, love.

762
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:16,880
~现在怎么办?上帝知道。
~ Now what? ~ God knows.

763
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:22,070
你知道，你做得很好。不，我不是。
~ You're doing really well, you know. ~ No, I'm not.

764
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:24,710
我想你是。~我在自言自语!
~ I think you are. ~ I'm talking to myself!

765
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:27,430
这通常是疯狂的表现。
That's usually a sign of madness.

766
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:30,270
你可以随时给格雷格打电话。
You could always ring Greg.

767
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:32,110
我不会给格雷格打电话的。他的确提出了。
~ I'm not ringing Greg. ~ He did offer.

768
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:34,230
我不会给格雷格打电话的。
I'm not ringing Greg.

769
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:38,030
也许他不像你想的那么傻。
Maybe he isn't as big a twerp as you think he is.

770
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:40,150
不，我认为作为笨蛋，在笨蛋部门
No, I think as twerps go - in the twerp department -

771
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:41,390
格雷格太过分了。
Greg goes off the deep end.

772
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:43,830
你就是不喜欢他。不是吧，夏洛克。
~ You just don't like him. ~ No shit, Sherlock.

773
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:46,270
不要在弗洛拉面前骂人。~对不起。
~ Don't swear in front of Flora. ~ Sorry.

774
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:49,990
~反正你用得太多了。你知道的，不是吗?~是的。
~ You over-use that phrase anyway. You know that, don't you? ~ Yup.

775
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:54,590
你也知道，格雷格
You do realise, as well, that Greg

776
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:58,190
是这个星球上唯一有可能这么做的人吗
is the only person on the planet who's likely to

777
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:02,030
像你和我妈妈一样保护弗洛拉。
feel as protective towards Flora as you and my mum do.

778
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:04,190
我妈妈又有什么用呢?
And what use is my mum going to be?

779
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:07,740
她将于周二飞回美国。
She's winging it back to the States on Tuesday.

780
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:11,830
你真的不喜欢我请保姆吗?
Would you really hate it if I got a nanny?

781
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:14,390
一个好保姆，一个非常好的，昂贵的，合适的保姆。
A good nanny, a really good, expensive, proper nanny.

782
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:16,630
我不会跟你说话的，卡罗琳。~看…
~ I wouldn't speak to you, Caroline. ~ Look...

783
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:19,430
你脑子里有《欢乐满人间》那个保姆根本不存在。
You've got Mary Poppins in your head. That nanny doesn't exist.

784
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:20,910
我来打几个电话。
Let me ring some of those numbers.

785
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:23,870
我们都可能会感到惊喜。我保证。我保证。
We might both be pleasantly surprised. I promise. I promise.

786
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:26,310
我不会做任何你讨厌的事。
I won't do anything you'd hate.

787
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:27,870
看！我也爱这个孩子!
Look! I love this kid too!

788
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:29,790
没有你想的那么多，但我想。
Not as much as you would've done, but I do.

789
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:32,510
我爱她，我会为她做我能做的一切!
I love her and I will do everything I can for her!

790
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:35,230
但我得处理这一切!
But I've got to deal with it all!

791
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:52,070
是什么让我困惑，妈妈，如果我…~虚伪的。
~ What confuses me though, Mother, if I'm being... ~ Disingenuous.

792
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:53,550
诚实的。
Honest.

793
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:55,070
这是什么意思?
What does that mean?

794
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:56,590
他知道。
He knows.

795
00:45:57,160 --> 00:46:00,310
不到两周前，约翰留下来了。
Is that less than two weeks ago, John stayed.

796
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:02,870
~是的，但是什么也没发生。他睡在你的房间。
~ Yeah, but nothing happened. ~ He slept in your room.

797
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:05,230
那并不意味着什么。通常是这样的。
~ That doesn't mean owt. ~ It usually does.

798
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:07,220
他昏了过去。好吗?
He crashed out. OK?

799
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:11,390
我为约翰感到难过。
I feel sorry for John.

800
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:14,030
他就像个迷路的…小……
He's like a lost... little...

801
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:15,470
他60多岁了。
He's in his 60s.

802
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:17,190
不，他不是!
No, he isn't!

803
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:19,470
是吗?
Is he?

804
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:20,910
谢丽尔呢?
What about Cheryl?

805
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:22,910
你知道谢丽尔!
You know about Cheryl!

806
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:24,670
她已经离开了。
She's cleared out and gone.

807
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:27,110
罗比一开始只是和她一起去的
And Robbie only went with her in the first place

808
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:29,670
因为他反对我做一个…
because he was reacting against me being a...

809
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:31,310
是一个…吗?
Being a...?

810
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:33,120
笨蛋。
Twit.

811
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:38,510
所以你和约翰，一切都结束了?
So you and John - that's all over and done with?

812
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:40,950
我甚至不再喜欢约翰了。~就像永远?
~ I don't even like John any more. ~ Like forever?

813
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,310
我不确定我是否做过。
I'm not sure I ever did.

814
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:45,510
~下次见。哦，不，我不讨厌他。
~ Till next time. ~ Well, no, I don't dislike him.

815
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:47,430
我只是觉得他很傻
I just think he brings out daft

816
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:50,390
愚蠢的东西在我身上，我不想再那样了。
stupid stuff in me and I don't want to be like that any more.

817
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:52,110
好吗?
OK?

818
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:57,510
罗比邀请了我，你知道，你喜欢他，
And Robbie's asked me and - you know - you like him,

819
00:46:57,560 --> 00:47:00,390
我喜欢他。这是显而易见的。
I like him. It's a no-brainer.

820
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:02,310
哦，那正合你意。
Oh, right up your street, then.

821
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:06,270
你真有趣!你很机智，也很敏锐。
You're so funny! You're so witty, you're so sharp.

822
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:10,150
~是的。自从他开始在加里家工作以来，他变得非常自大。
~ Yup. ~ He's got all cocky since he's started working at Gary's.

823
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:12,750
天知道为什么。这只是一个星期六的工作。
God knows why. It's only a Saturday job.

824
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:14,030
我不知道。
Cock o' t'midden.

825
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:16,470
有个叔叔当老板真是太酷了。
It's so cool having an uncle who's the boss.

826
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:19,670
人们为了表现得好而倾尽全力……对我!
People falling all over themselves being nice... to me!

827
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:21,630
~粪堆上的公鸡。你给他打电话了吗?
~ Cock o' the dung-hill. ~ Did you ring him?

828
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:23,150
我什么时候有时间?
When have I had time?

829
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:24,430
他说给他打电话。
He said to ring him.

830
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:26,950
我也不想听任何自作聪明的废话
And I don't want to hear any smart-arse shit-stirring

831
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,710
在罗比面前评论约翰。
comments about John in front of Robbie.

832
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:30,910
对吧?
Right?

833
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:32,630
你好!
Hiya!

834
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:34,830
再过一刻钟晚饭就好了。
Supper'll be ready in a quarter of an hour.

835
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:37,150
太棒了!完美!
Fantastic! Perfect!

836
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:39,350
我能做点什么吗?摆桌子?
Can I do anything? Set the table?

837
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:41,590
不，你没事的，亲爱的。我已经做到了。
No, you're all right, love. I've done it.

838
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:43,590
我们要邀请加里参加我们的婚礼吗?
Are we inviting Gary to t'wedding?

839
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:45,630
~肯定。~没有。为什么不呢?
~ Sure. ~ No. ~ Why not?

840
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:48,030
我们为什么不呢?我们不妨。
~ Why aren't we? ~ We might as well.

841
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:50,830
我想如果你不邀请他，他会有点生气的。
I think he'd be a bit pissed off if you didn't invite him.

842
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:53,750
哦，亲爱的。我们为什么不邀请他?
~ Oh, dear. ~ Why aren't we inviting him?

843
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:56,710
我是开玩笑的。
I was joking.

844
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:58,710
我们当然会邀请他。
Course we're inviting him.

845
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:01,310
她不喜欢他。她嫉妒他。
She doesn't like him. She's jealous of him.

846
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:03,150
我为什么要嫉妒他?
Why am I jealous of him?

847
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:05,710
如此成功和友善。
Being so successful and nice.

848
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:06,990
是的,不管。
Yeah, whatever.

849
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:10,670
反正他知道婚礼的事。因为我发短信告诉他了。和爷爷。
He knows about t'wedding, anyway. cos I've texted him and told him. And Grandad.

850
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:14,040
我想爷爷对你为什么不亲自告诉他有点困惑。
I think Grandad were a bit bemused about how come you'd not told him yourself.

851
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:27,990
你不喜欢他吗?加里。
Don't you like him? Gary.

852
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:29,790
我当然喜欢他!
Course I like him!

853
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:32,870
是啊，那又怎样?summat。
Yeah, but what, then? There's summat.

854
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:35,720
我不知道。我不知道。
I don't know. I don't know.

855
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:38,830
我喜欢她。
I like her.

856
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:41,950
~幸福。~她绕着燃烧的漩涡。
~ Felicity. ~ She's round the flaming twist.

857
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,760
她很有趣。
She's funny.

858
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:48,260
那么,什么呢?
What, then?

859
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:52,310
她叹了口气
SHE SIGHS

860
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:57,870
他是个好人，我爸爸。他犯了一个错误，
He's a good man, me dad. He made a mistake,

861
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:01,440
他做了不该做的事，但我不能把他钉在十字架上。
he did something he shouldn't have, but I can't crucify him.

862
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:06,880
加里很棒。多可爱的人啊。我们有多幸运?
And Gary's great. What a lovely man. How lucky are we?

863
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:11,820
但是…我不晓得。
But... I dunno.

864
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:19,150
我爸爸对他很着迷
Me dad's so fascinated by him,

865
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:25,710
就好像他是一个成功的，温文尔雅的，他本该拥有的神童。
like he's the successful, suave, wunderkind he should've always had.

866
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:28,550
而不是他最后得到的那个没用的笨蛋。
Rather than the feckless knob that he ended up with.

867
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:32,590
~你爸爸没这么说。他当然没说过。
~ You dad's not said that. ~ Course he's not said it.

868
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:35,940
所以你也没给你爸发短信吗?
Is that why you didn't text your dad either?

869
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:41,640
如果这能安慰你的话。我觉得你很完美。
Well, if it's any consolation. I think you're perfect.

870
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:50,630
我最好给他打个电话。
I'd better ring him.

871
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:52,550
看看他想要什么。
See what he wants.

872
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,270
~迟了!对不起。~没关系。
~ Late! Sorry. ~ That's OK.

873
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:05,830
你好吗？
How are you?

874
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:07,880
我能喝点茶吗?
Can I have some tea?

875
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:12,150
谢谢你来见我。很高兴见到你。
~ Thanks for meeting me. ~ It's nice to see you.

876
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:14,030
是吗?
Is it?

877
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:16,480
为什么不呢?~嗯…
~ Why wouldn't it be? ~ Well...

878
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,470
艾伦已经两周没给我打电话了。
Alan hasn't rung me for two weeks.

879
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:20,510
他一直在哈罗盖特。~是的。
~ He's been in Harrogate. ~ Yeah.

880
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:24,950
这一切都很痛苦。适合所有人。
It's all been pretty traumatic. For everyone.

881
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:28,360
确定。但你也没给我打电话。直到星期天。
Sure. But then you didn't ring me either. Till Sunday.

882
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,670
嗯，我也有点忙不过来了。
Well, I've been a bit snowed under meself as well.

883
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:36,510
课程。课程。我只是有点多疑。
Course. Course. It's just that I'm paranoid.

884
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:38,700
是吗?~不正常。
~ Are you? ~ Not normally.

885
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:43,510
拉夫怎么样了?
How's Raff doing?

886
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:47,590
很好!他很喜欢。他很棒，是个很好的小伙子。
Really well! He loves it. He's great, he's such a nice lad.

887
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:48,950
谢谢你！他可以。
Thank you. He can be.

888
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:52,200
当他不是…自大的小混蛋。
When he's not being a... cocky little dick.

889
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:58,510
我和费利西蒂最近关系不太好。
Me and Felicity haven't been getting on very well lately.

890
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:00,870
~真的吗?~对不起，那是……
~ Really? ~ Sorry, that's...

891
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:03,430
~没有。~我是说…自从这一切发生之后。
~ No. ~ I mean... it's since all this.

892
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:05,870
所以可能都是我的错。
So it's probably all my fault.

893
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:07,990
为什么?你是什么意思?
Why? What do you mean?

894
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:10,590
我突然……
I suddenly...

895
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:12,510
我感到很生气。
I felt very angry.

896
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:16,630
那个星期天我们一起吃过午饭之后。
After we'd been over for lunch the other Sunday.

897
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:18,230
为什么?
Why?

898
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:20,020
卡洛琳怎么样?
How's Caroline?

899
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:24,070
她的应对。你为什么生气?
She's coping. Why did you feel angry?

900
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:25,990
我不知道为什么。
I don't know why.

901
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:28,470
~这不是…对…生气?
~ It's not... ~ Angry with...?

902
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:33,070
一切。与…为什么我的父母从来不告诉我。
Everything. With... Why my parents never told me.

903
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:36,070
你知道，我现在再也不能和他们谈这个话题了。
You know, that's a conversation that I can never have with them now.

904
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:38,510
是的，我知道。我明白了。我明白。
Yeah, I know. I understand. I do understand.

905
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:39,950
因为我对……
Because I feel the same about...

906
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,790
我记起了一些事情。过去发生的事情。
And I'm remembering things. Things that happened in the past.

907
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:47,350
我想知道他们是否更关心我们的亚当——我的兄弟——而不是我。
And I'm wondering whether they did think more about our Adam - my brother - than they did about me.

908
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:50,790
~他比呃…年轻?~是啊!我爸爸是他爸爸，他真正的爸爸。
~ He's younger than erm...? ~ Yeah! Yeah, and my dad was his dad, his proper dad.

909
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:55,190
我从来没有，从来没有这样想过。
And I've never, NEVER thought like this before.

910
00:51:55,240 --> 00:52:00,870
我以前从来没有生气或嫉妒过。好吧，不是这样的。
I've never felt angry or jealous before. Well, not like this.

911
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:02,670
我知道。
I know.

912
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:06,190
它改变了过去。几乎。尽管事实并非如此。
It changes the past. Almost. Even though it doesn't.

913
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:11,750
但是，是的。它给过去涂上了色彩。是的，这很难。
But it - yeah. It colours the past. And yeah, that's difficult.

914
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:13,830
~但是…~那就没人…没人给我打电话。
~ But... ~ Then no-one... nobody rings me up.

915
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:15,270
在那个星期天之后，
After that Sunday,

916
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:17,710
所以我脑子里满是关于我亲生父母的事
so I've got all this shit in my head about my real parents,

917
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:21,190
我在想，“哦，现在他真的不想了解我了”。
and I'm thinking, "Oh, and now he doesn't really want to get to know me".

918
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:24,710
~不，那是……但是我总是要打电话。
~ No, that's... ~ But I am the one who always has to do the ringing up.

919
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:28,630
不。加里。诚实。你想得太多了。
No. Gary. Honestly. You're reading too much into it.

920
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:30,110
这几周很奇怪。
It's been an odd few weeks.

921
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:32,300
你要结婚了!
You're getting married!

922
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:34,670
是啊!
Yeah!

923
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:37,230
你被邀请了!
You are invited!

924
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:38,620
真的吗?
Really?

925
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:42,910
如果你担心没有我爸爸的消息，就给他打电话!
Just ring me dad up if you're worried you've not heard from him!

926
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:46,070
~是的，但是我…~什么?我不敢。
~ Yeah, but I... ~ What? ~ I daren't.

927
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:48,870
不敢吗?你是加里·杰克逊!
Daren't? You're Gary Jackson!

928
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:50,870
那不代表什么!
That doesn't mean anything!

929
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:54,030
我可不想最后总觉得自己是个讨厌鬼!
I don't want to end up feeling like I'm being a nuisance all the time!

930
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:56,820
我爸爸不会那样想的。
My dad would never think like that.

931
00:52:57,480 --> 00:52:58,950
你的爸爸?
Your dad?

932
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:03,590
是的。我爸爸，你爸爸。无论什么。
Yeah. My dad, your dad. Whatever.

933
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:05,030
他对我感兴趣，是吗?
He is interested in me, isn't he?

934
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:08,070
是的!绝对的!他觉得你很棒!
Yes! Absolutely! He thinks you're fantastic!

935
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:10,270
西莉亚也喜欢我。
And Celia liked me.

936
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:13,230
她爱你。~对不起。
~ She loved you. ~ Sorry.

937
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:15,790
~不要…~我不是这样的。这，这只是…
~ Don't... ~ I'm not like this. This - it's just...

938
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:20,430
真是太震惊了，吉莉安。和…这就像……
it's just been such a shock, Gillian. And... It's like...

939
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:22,710
我才刚刚明白过来。正常。所有的…
it's only just sunk in. Properly. All the...

940
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:25,870
~我知道。~影响。~我知道。我知道。
~ I know. ~ Implications. ~ I know. I do know.

941
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:28,870
对不起。我——对不起——我被迷住了。
Sorry. I get - sorry - I get obsessed.

942
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:32,720
还有一些奇怪的事情。这就是我!
And a little bit weird about stuff. That's just me!

943
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:38,790
她给我端茶来了吗?~冷静点。
~ Is she even bringing me some tea? ~ Calm down.

944
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:41,580
~是的。是的。是的。是的。~冷静点。
~ Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. ~ Calm down.

945
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:58,070
我一到家就给你发邮件。
I'm going to e-mail you the second I'm home.

946
00:53:58,120 --> 00:53:59,550
是的。请做。
Yes. Please do.

947
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:02,150
我要回来过暑假。~好。
~ And I'm going to be back for the summer. ~ Good.

948
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:05,430
整整两个星期!
For two whole weeks!

949
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:08,480
我要给你带很多东西!
And I'm going to bring you so much stuff!

950
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:12,680
然后你和妈妈
And then you and Mom -

951
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:16,590
这个妈妈要来看我。
this Mom - are going to visit me.

952
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:18,710
~是的。~没错。
~ We are. ~ That's right.

953
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:21,680
西莉亚。
Celia.

954
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:25,710
祝你一路平安。
You have a safe journey.

955
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:27,030
艾伦。
Alan.

956
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:32,110
你们俩真是太好了。
You've both been so kind.

957
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:35,390
你们保持联系。我们两个，还有这两个。
You keep in touch. With us two, as well as these two.

958
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:37,880
我会的，我当然会。
I will, of course I will.

959
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:13,520
你还好吧，亲爱的?~是的。
~ Y'all right, love? ~ Yup.

960
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:25,070
艾略特博士吗?
Dr Elliot?

961
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:26,870
霍莉?
Holly?

962
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:29,670
这是…吗?这里是康威路46号。
Is this...? This is 46 Conway Drive.

963
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:31,510
我在找麦肯齐-道森医生。
I'm looking for a Dr McKenzie-Dawson.

964
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:34,110
~哦。是的。那就是我。~是吗?
~ Oh. Yes. That's me. ~ Is it?

965
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:36,430
是的……我，我结婚了。
Yes... I - I got married.

966
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:41,390
天啊。好。中介派我来的。
Gosh. Well. The agency sent me.

967
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:45,230
我早到了十分钟，不过如果你愿意，我可以先走了再回来。~不，不，不要那样做。
~ And I'm ten minutes early, but I can go away and come back if you like. ~ No, no, don't do that.

968
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:48,750
~但是…你去苏塞克斯读社会学。~我退学了!
~ But... you went off to Sussex to read sociology. ~ I dropped out!

969
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:50,990
那个姓，当中介打来电话的时候……那不是……
The surname - when the agency rang... That wasn't...

970
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:53,470
~我没有…~我退学了，我也结婚了!
~ I didn't... ~ I dropped out and I got married too!

971
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:55,670
现在我是保姆了。我从没想过去苏塞克斯。
And now I'm a nanny. I never wanted to go to Sussex.

972
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:58,270
是我的父母。祝福他们。和你!
It was my parents. Bless them. And you!

973
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:00,070
对我们所有人来说都是如此雄心勃勃!
So ambitious for us all!

974
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:03,470
但我真正想做的就是这个。这就是我要做的!
But all I ever really wanted to do was this. And now that's what I am doing!

975
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:06,710
老实说，我再高兴不过了。
And I couldn't be happier, honestly.

976
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:09,990
冬青。这是我妈妈。这是我的继父。
Holly. This is my mother. And this is my stepfather.

977
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:12,350
你好!~西莉亚。
~ How do you do? ~ Celia.

978
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:14,270
艾伦。你好。
Alan. Hello.

979
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:16,390
这是弗洛拉。
And this is Flora.

980
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:20,470
你好,植物!我的天哪，你真漂亮!
Hello, Flora! My goodness me, aren't you pretty?

981
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:22,270
多漂亮的皮肤啊。
What beautiful skin.

982
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:23,990
我不是她的生母。
I'm not her biological mother.

983
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:27,630
做的,嗯…局里跟你解释过我的情况了吗?
Did, erm... did the agency explain my situation to you?

984
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:29,920
不。不，不完全是。
No. Not - not entirely.

985
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:33,110
你想喝点茶吗?
Would you like some tea?

986
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:34,870
我想喝点茶。
I'd love some tea.

987
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:37,470
~你想进来吗?~谢谢。
~ Do you want to come inside? ~ Thank you.

988
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:39,470
多漂亮的房子啊!
What a gorgeous house!

989
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:41,230
天哪，看看这些虹膜。
Gosh, look at those irises.

990
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:43,590
那绝对是我最喜欢的颜色。
That's my absolute number one favourite colour.

991
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:45,990
哇。那是你的车吗?
Wow. Is that your car?

992
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:47,390
不,这是……
No, it's...

993
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:48,710
真的吗?好样的!
Really? Good for you!

994
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:51,590
如果我可以选择一辆车，我想我会选那辆。认真对待。
If I could choose a car, I think I'd choose that one. Seriously.

995
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:54,880
除了我不敢开它。我想我还是看着它吧。
Except I'd be scared to drive it. I think I'd just rather look at it.

996
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:58,240
天啊，这走廊真漂亮……
Gosh, it's a nice hallway...

997
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:01,590
今天我们可能会去克纳斯伯勒野餐。
Today we might take a picnic to Knaresborough.

998
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:04,230
我们刚接到布拉德福德警方的电话。
We've just had a phone call from the police in Bradford.

999
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:06,750
~他们抓走了弗洛拉。警察抓了弗洛拉?
~ They've got Flora. ~ The police've got Flora?

1000
