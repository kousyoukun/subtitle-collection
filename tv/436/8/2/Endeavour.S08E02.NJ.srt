595
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:16,399
That makes it sometime after last night's seven o'clock mass.

unless it's prearranged with the priest?

There's no exit wound this time, so calibre will have to wait on the PM.
这次不是贯穿伤 所以子弹口径结果要到下午才能出来

that would be of interest to the same killer?
会让同一个凶手感兴趣

604

Until we have forensics on the bullet, we don't know they were.
弹道鉴定结果出来前 不能判定是同一凶手所为

605
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:46,599

Still no excuse for a grubby shirt.

Slovenly dress leads to a slovenly mind.

626
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:38,719
If more connects these cases than robbery,

in front of the grandfather clock?

The key was on the floor next to him.

-玻璃门开着 是为了给钟上发条  -没错

His wife told us he always wound the clocks at 9:00.
他妻子说他一般会在9点给钟上发条

insofar as we've been able to establish

at what time each of the murders took place.

Father Mahoney at 8:00.

And Commodore Maynard at 9:00.

1215
01:20:18,280 --> 01:20:19,639
Which tells us...

1216
01:20:19,640 --> 01:20:22,839
..that the killer changed the time on a watch or clock
在每一个犯罪现场 凶手都调整了

1217
01:20:22,840 --> 01:20:24,639
at each of the scene of crimes.

把Maynard准将的

he changed Commodore Maynard's carriage clock to 3:10.
马车钟从9点调成3点10分

1223

我们之前以为他是想给自己制造假的不在场证明

If you say so.

Whether he likes it or not.
