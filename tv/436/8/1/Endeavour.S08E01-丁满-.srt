00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:17,479
She'll be back in a minute,
I'm sure.

704
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,039
I can't have a late night, George.

705
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,799
I've got a match tomorrow.

706
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,919
Are you staying on for it?
Yeah, of course.

707
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,599
We're all put up at the Plaza.

708
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,359
Your mum and sisters and everyone.

709
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,879
Great.

710
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:30,200
Great, we'll do something after,
then. OK?

711
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,679
Home!

712
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,599
You're late, Dad!

713
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,479
Work went on.

714
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,560
You missed Sam on the telephone.

715
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:44,320
I gave him your best.

716
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,240
All right over there, is it...

717
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:50,799
..with the locals?

718
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,280
Behaving themselves?

719
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,159
He didn't say.

720
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:57,720
I asked if he was looking
after himself. He said he was.

721
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:02,039
I'll put the kettle on.
Nothing for me this late.

722
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:04,599
Fair dos. Here...

723
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,639
you'll never guess
who I met tonight.

724
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,439
Who? Someone we know?

725
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,999
Eamonn Andrews.

726
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,599
Eamonn Andrews?

727
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,839
Fancy!

728
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,359
What's he like?

729
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,640
Very nice.

730
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:20,000
But not as tall as he looks
on the telly.

731
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:23,519
Sorry to drag you away.

732
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,759
I just had to get out.

733
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:28,200
You know, get away.

734
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,600
Sometimes, it takes me like that.

735
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:35,519
I get tired of it.
Of what?

736
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,399
Being Jack Swift.

737
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:40,319
What, the adulation, women, money?

738
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,239
My commiserations!
Aye.

739
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,959
It looks great from the outside.

740
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:46,639
But everyone wants something.

741
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:49,159
A signed photo.
A cut of your wages.

742
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:50,359
To be your friend.

743
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:52,999
To take them to bed so they can run
to the papers about it.

744
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,639
And what do you want?

745
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,600
The love of a good woman.

746
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,000
I had one, too.

747
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:01,480
And I let her go.

748
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,919
It was put to me I had to choose.

749
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,240
It was her...

750
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:10,199
..or success at the football.

751
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:12,319
There's not a day goes by...

752
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,519
HE CHUCKLES

753
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,480
And now they want to kill me for it.

754
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,240
Have you got a girl?

755
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:26,119
Er, no. No, not at the moment.

756
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:29,320
I could get some company over.
Make a call.
