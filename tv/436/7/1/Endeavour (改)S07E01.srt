What do you think you're doing, eh,
touching her like that?

17
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,960
So, I've got this dog
and I love my dog,

18
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,960
but I had to take it
to the vets the other day,

19
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,960
vet took one look at it,

20
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,960
picked him up, checked his eyes,
checked his ears, checked his teeth.

21
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,960
Then he went, "I'm really sorry,
I've gotta put the dog down."

22
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,960
I burst into tears,
why you gotta put him down?

23
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,960
He said, "He's really heavy."
LAUGHTER

24
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,960
So, there's this, er, Irish man...

00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,960
Three more chicken in a basket.

26

00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,960
Yeah.

29
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,960
Yeah, sorry, Tony.

30
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,960
I'm fine. It was just a turn.

31
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,480
I'll be all right.

32
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,960
This is more like it.

33
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,960
Thank you.

We said... no questions.

39
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,640
Got a name for her?

40
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,480
I wouldn't like to swear to it,

41
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,160
but I think it could be
Molly Andrews.

42
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,960
Barmaid down The Grapes.

43
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,960
Taking a short-cut home, maybe?

44
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,960
Body was found by David Clemens.

45
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,960
Works at the Morris plant.

46
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,960
Keep-fit fanatic.

47
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,480
Doctor.
Gentlemen.

48
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:10,000
Have to wait on the post-mortem
to confirm it, but...

49
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,960
cause of death would appear to be
a broken neck.

50
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:14,960
That what the mark's about?

51
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,960
Yes. Possibly.

52
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,960
I'll know more after the PM.

53
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,960
Any...?

54
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,960
If that was the motive,
he hasn't gone through with it.

55
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,960
He may have been disturbed,
of course.

56
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,320
Shall we say two o'clock?

57
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:37,640
Oh, and, er...

58
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,000
Happy New Year.

59
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,960
Her handbag was found over there.

60
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,960
No purse in it.

61
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,960
Robbery, you think?

62
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,960
Some drunk, maybe?

63
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,320
Be enough of 'em about last night.

64
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,960
Tried it on.

65
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:57,480
Or'd had too much of a skinful
to do what he meant to.

66
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,320
Uniform up and down the towpath.

67
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,960
See if anyone moored up,
saw anything.

68
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,320
So, how was your New Year's Eve?

69
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,960
Resolutions?

70
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,960
Find out who did this. You?

71
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,960
Oh, I'm long past mending my ways.

72
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,960
New Year, new decade...

73
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,000
..new start.

74
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,960
You always hope for better,
don't you?

75
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,960
Bitter mornings,

76
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,960
up in the dark and the cold,

77
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:37,960
and the worst of human nature
at the end of it.

78
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:41,320
You start to wonder how many more
of these you've got in you.

79
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,160
No Morse today?

80
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,640
Fortnight's leave.

81
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,960
Oh, yeah.
Anywhere nice?

82
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:08,960
What time is it?

83
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,960
1970.

84
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,960
Felice anno nuovo.

85
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,160
RADIO: The body of a young woman

86
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,960
discovered on a stretch
of canal towpath

87
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,960
in the early hours
of New Year's Day,

88
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:54,960
has been identified
as 24-year-old Molly Andrews.

89
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,960
Miss Andrews
is believed to have been attacked

90
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,960
shortly after finishing her shift
at The Grapes pub in Oxford

91
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,960
where she worked as a barmaid.

92
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:04,960
The investigation into her murder
is continuing.

93
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,960
I told you, I was at a party.

94
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:12,640
I left The Grapes, but wasn't gonna
get home before midnight, was I?

95
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,320
The landlord says you were arguing
with her earlier in the night.

96
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,960
Then you started
chucking your weight around.

97
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:18,960
Said he had to throw you out.

98
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,960
Somebody said she'd been
seeing another fella.

99
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:22,960
Some college type.

100
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,960
Where's this come from?

101
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,000
I just heard it somewhere, is all.

102
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,960
All right.

103
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,960
Let's just have it one more time.

104
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,320
From the beginning.

105
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,960
'Fiore per la signora?'

106
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,960
Oh, no, grazie.

107
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,960
Si!

108
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,960
Avaro! Come se dice...

109
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:56,960
..cheap!

110
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,960
HE LAUGHS
Discerning.

111
00:11:58,960 --> 00:11:59,960
Grazie.
Grazie.

112
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,960
If you wanna rose,
I'll get you a rose.

113
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,480
I just won't waste money
on this artificial rubbish.

114
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,640
It will never fade.

115
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,960
Never die.

116
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,800
Yeah, but it's not real.

117
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,960
Michelangelo's David isn't David.

118
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,960
"Ceci n'est pas une pipe."

119
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,960
If it's beautiful, does it matter?

120
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,960
You think he is responsible?

121
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:24,960
Denying it, of course,

122
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,960
but they were seen rowing
earlier in the evening.

123
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,960
And her purse is missing.

124
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,960
We're searching Sturgis' place now.

125
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,000
No sign of it as yet.

126
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,960
At the bottom of the canal,
as like as not.

127
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,960
I've divers coming in,
but in my opinion,

128
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,960
the whole purse business
is just a blind.

129
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:43,000
A domestic dispute
leading to a murder, Thursday?

130
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,640
Such a ruse as you're suggesting

131
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,960
supposes a far greater
presence of mind

132
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:50,960
than one usually finds
in cases like these.

133
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:53,960
It's him. I know it is.
I can feel it in my corns.

134
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:54,960
I can crack him.

135
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:55,960
I'm sure.

136
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:58,480
Well, keep me abreast
of any developments.

137
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,960
Of course.

138
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,480
Very well. Carry on.

139
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,960
Sir.

140
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,960
If I might ask, sir.

141
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:12,960
How's Mrs Bright bearing up?

142
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,960
As well as can be expected.

143
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,960
You're back, then?
How was, erm...?

144
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:53,320
Oh, you know.

145
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,960
So, what've I missed?

146
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:38,960
GIRLS GIGGLE

147
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:39,960
I'm given to understand
that the ACC's daughter
GIRLS GIGGLE

148
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,960
I'm given to understand
that the ACC's daughter

149
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,960
was amongst a group of young women

150
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:46,960
making their way back
from Lady Matilda's boathouse,

151
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:47,960
along the towpath,

152
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,960
when a man exposed himself to them.

153
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:53,960
Obviously, with the killer
of the barmaid...

154
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,480
Molly Andrews, sir.

155
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,000
Yes, thank you, Sergeant.

156
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,960
..the young woman at New Year,
still at large,

157
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:02,000
the ACC is keen to know
what progress is being made.

158
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,960
Bit of a sticker, sir.

159
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:06,960
But I'm still of the strong opinion
that the boyfriend's responsible.

160
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:07,960
Carl Sturgis.

161
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:10,320
Her purse was taken, wasn't it?

162
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,320
Doesn't that suggest a robbery?

163
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,960
One wouldn't expect that
in a domestic dispute.

164
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:18,960
The boyfriend always seemed
a little pedestrian to my mind.

165
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,160
Plus, he's alibied, isn't he?

166
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,960
What's this?

167
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:24,960
Well, a cab driver said he picked
him up outside The Grapes, smashed,

168
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,960
and dropped him
at an address in Cowley.

169
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,960
Had to pour him through
the letter box, supposedly.

170
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:30,960
Well, he could've come back.

171
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,960
That's if the cabby
had the right man.

172
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,960
Sturgis did say that
he got a cab though, didn't he?

173
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:36,960
One young drunk on New Year's Eve

174
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,960
looks much like another,
I'd have thought.

175
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:43,000
Ye... I...

176
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,480
I was on leave the initial week
of the investigation,

177
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,960
so I may not have the full picture.

178
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,960
Indeed.

179
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:54,960
Well, perhaps you might
take another look.

180
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,960
What do you say, Thursday?

181
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:58,960
Fresh pair of eyes.

182
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,800
If you think so, sir.

183
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,960
Yes, well,
I can't see the harm in it.

184
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,960
Done yourself an injury, Sergeant?

185
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,960
Rat, sir. Big bugger.

186
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:13,960
Been hanging about the coal shed.

187
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:16,960
Gave me a nip when I went up the
yard last night to fill the scuttle.

188
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,640
But you've seen someone about it?

189
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,960
Yes, sir. Tetanus first thing.
From the house man.

190
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:30,960
Where is he, the boyfriend?

191
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,960
Carl Sturgis?
Mm-hm.

192
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,960
Drives for Duxbury's at Cowley.

193
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,960
Undertakers.
I'll dig out the address.

194
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,960
Pedestrian? You never said.

195
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:47,960
Well, I came to it late.

196
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,960
I thought perhaps you knew
something I didn't.

197
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,960
Not everything's a crossword puzzle.

198
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,960
Sometimes, how everything looks
is how it is.

199
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,960
The boyfriend, the husband,
the father, the brother.

200
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:59,960
Right, so, if you thought he did it,

201
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:00,960
why didn't you charge him?

202
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:03,480
We couldn't put him at the scene!

203
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:07,800
We turned his place inside out.
Not a shred. No purse. No nothing.

204
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,800
And if he didn't do it?

205
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,960
Then I'm sure
you'll get to the bottom of it.

206
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,960
Did Molly ever mention
a college type?

207
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:25,960
Boyfriend, perhaps?

208
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:26,960
Not lately.

209
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,960
She did like the college-y ones.

210
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,960
Said they treated her more nice.

211
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,960
Thought I was done with kiddies.

212
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:36,960
My Rose.

213
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,960
Molly.

214
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,960
Now Lucy.
Third time lucky.

215
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,960
What about the child's father?

216
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,960
New Year's Eve, when your
granddaughter didn't come home,

217
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,960
you weren't concerned?

218
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:56,640
I took it she was seeing her fella.

219
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,960
Carl Sturgis?

220
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,640
She weren't a bad girl.

221
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,960
Just lonely.

222
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,960
I think it's not having
a father herself.

223
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,960
She was always
looking for something.

224
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,960
What did you make to him? Carl.

225
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:17,960
Couldn't say.

226
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,960
She never brung any of 'em home.

227
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,960
DIRECTOR: Professor Donald Blish,
Cardinal College.

228
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,960
Higher Mathematics screen test,

229
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,960
Seventh of May, 1970.

230
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:34,960
BELL RINGS
And action!

231
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,960
Hello, and welcome to Module Seven.

232
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:40,960
In this module,
we'll be looking at...

233
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,960
Rectilinear shapes.

234
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,320
Erm, don't tell me, don't tell me,
er... What is it?

235
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,960
DIRECTOR: Particularly triangles.

236
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:53,160
Thank you. Erm, particularly
trian... particularly triangles.

237
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:57,320
And finding the gradient,
equations and intersections

238
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:00,960
of medians, altitudes
and perpendicular bisectors.

239
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,960
Sorry, this isn't public.

240
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,960
Oh, Detective Sergeant Morse.
Thames Valley.

241
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,320
I'm looking for a Carl Sturgis.

242
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,960
This about Molly Andrews?

243
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,480
I said all I had to
when it happened.

244
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,960
Don't you wanna find out what
happened to your girlfriend?

245
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,640
I know who you lot think did it.

246
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,320
Not me, I wasn't part
of the original inquiry.

247
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,480
I'm keeping an open mind.

248
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,960
That's why I'm here.
Why what do you think happened?

249
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,960
I don't know.

250
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,960
I'd give anything not
to have had that row with her.

251
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,960
I wasn't thinking straight.

252
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,960
I liked her.

253
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,960
She was a smashin' bird.

254
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,960
She was a smashin' bird and
now she's dead, and it's my fault.

255
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:45,800
If I hadn't acted like a berk...

256
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,960
This other man
you thought she'd been seeing?

257
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:52,960
"Some college type," you said in
interview. Where d'you get that?

258
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,960
One of me mates said
he'd seen her in town with a bloke

259
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,960
who looked like he was in college.

260
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:02,160
You know the sort,
scarf, pushing a bike.

261
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,960
Should one get an agent,
do you think,

262
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,320
just to handle the money?

263
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,960
Putting the cart somewhat
before the horse, aren't you?

264
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,960
No. No, I don't think so, Jeremy.

265
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,960
Oh, they told you
you'd got the job, did they?

266
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:22,960
Well, not in so many words, but
I think we've got an understanding.

267
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,960
Look at this.

268
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,960
Well, well.

269
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:33,960
Dr Naomi Benford, 28,
currently, Junior Research Fellow

270
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,960
at The Department
of Latent Potential.

271
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:38,960
As you tilt the horizontal plane,
the section is an ellipse,

272
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,960
but there will come a point where
the plane is parallel to the line.

273
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:46,960
Now, let's see
how that applies to...

274
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,960
Strong... to break someone's neck?

275
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,800
Not necessarily.

276
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,960
The right angle, a sudden twist.

277
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,960
At least it would
have been relatively quick.

278
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02,960
Nothing out of the ordinary, then?

279
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,960
All too ordinary, I'm afraid.

280
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:08,960
The female of the species
might hold good for Kipling,

281
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,000
but he never walked a crooked mile
in these brogues.

282
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:19,960
There's nothing here that
wasn't in my report at the time.

283
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,960
Well, I was on leave at the time.

284
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,480
Mr Bright's asked me
to take a second look.

285
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,960
It's just fresh horses.

286
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:28,160
What do you make
to the mark on her neck?

287
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,960
Ligature?

288
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,960
Garrotte, possibly?

289
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:34,960
But I thought you said her neck was
broken, that she wasn't asphyxiated.

290
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:40,800
Well, perhaps, he started out
trying to choke her and...

291
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,960
changed his mind.

292
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,960
You don't sound terribly convinced.

293
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,960
I'm not.

294
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:51,960
Answers on a postcard
to the usual address.

295
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:54,960
I think she's got a bloody nerve.
She's not been here five minutes.

296
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:55,960
Oh, give it a rest, will you?

297
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,960
Oh, speak of the little succubus.

298
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,960
Here she is, look.

299
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,960
You are a dark horse,
aren't you, love?

300
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,960
Something you want, Ferman?

301
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,960
I just wondered
where you got the idea

302
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,960
you would put yourself forward
for the television.

303
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:10,960
I wasn't aware
I had to ask your permission (?)

304
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,800
There was an advert
in the college newsletter.

305
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:15,480
Oh, I know there was. We all saw it.

306
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,960
There's such a thing
as seniority, you know.

307
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,960
You've heard the phrase,
best man for the job, have you?

308
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:20,960
SHE SCOFFS
Don't talk rot.

309
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,960
You're a junior research fellow.

310
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,960
Tea and filing,
that's what you're here for

311
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,320
and don't you forget it.

312
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,960
Naomi, if you have a moment.

313
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,960
And a certain woman,

314
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,800
which had an issue of blood
12 years

315
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:07,960
And had suffered many
things of many physicians

316
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:10,960
and spent all that she had,
and was nothing bettered,

317
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,960
but rather grew worse.

318
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:17,000
When she had heard of Jesus

319
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,960
she came into the press behind,

320
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,960
and touched his garment.

321
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:26,000
And he said unto her,

322
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:32,960
Daughter, thy faith
hath made thee whole.

323
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:38,960
Go in peace,
and be whole of thy plague.

324
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,960
I am feeling better, Puli.

325
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,960
Stronger every day.

326
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,000
Well, that's marvellous.

327
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:17,960
You do have faith, don't you, Puli?

328
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,480
Of course, my dear.

329
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,960
Of course.

330
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:52,960
You said to call
if I didn't hear anything.

331
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,960
No. No, I understand. No.

332
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,000
I haven't changed my mind.

333
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,960
I'll be in for
the usual session next week,

334
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,960
but you know where to get hold of me
if there's any news.

335
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,160
OK, bye now.

336
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,160
Morning, yeah.

337
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:51,960
Morning, Win.

338
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,960
Morning, Reet. Bridget.

339
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,960
Shoo. Shoo!

340
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:16,000
It's nine o'clock with Mr Bright.

341
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,960
Sharp, he said.

342
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:20,960
Traditionally, the condemned man
gets a hearty breakfast.

343
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,960
Oh, come on, it's not like that.

344
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:26,000
Isn't it? My investigation
passed scrutiny, then?

345
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,800
Well. Early days.

346
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:30,960
That right?

347
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,960
Butter's cold.

348
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,960
Square.

349
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,800
Wavy lines.

350
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,160
So, going through
the original statements,

351
00:27:57,160 --> 00:28:00,960
there's a dog-walker came forward,
day after the body was discovered,

352
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,960
said he'd heard someone
whistling on the towpath. Whistling?

353
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,640
Hm. A melody that he couldn't place.

354
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,960
But it doesn't seem
to have been followed up.

355
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,000
I followed it up.

356
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,960
I spoke to him.
Mr Scrimm. He didn't see anyone.

357
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,960
There's nothing to say
it was connected, sir.

358
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,960
What about traffic on the canal?

359
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,320
Very little of it, sir.

360
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:21,960
The odd bit of boating for pleasure,
but not at that time of year.

361
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:24,960
I'm sorry, sir,
but that's not strictly true.

362
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:30,960
Erm, I have a report
of a narrow boat, The Rosie Jugg,

363
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,960
logged passing through
Braunston Junction

364
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,960
in the early hours
of New Year's Day.

365
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,800
Skipper was an Abraham Petrovski.

366
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:41,800
He has history of petty theft
and drunken disorderliness.

367
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,960
Though, where he is now
is anybody's guess.

368
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,960
Any other business?

369
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,000
Good.

370
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,960
Erm, F-23?
I just wondered,

371
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,640
now you've had a little time.

372
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:25,640
Mm. Well, I don't think we're
taking that any further, are we?

373
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,960
F-23 scores very highly.

374
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,960
Some little nobody?

375
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,960
What's that got
to do with anything?

376
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,960
She might not know which knife
and fork to use at high table,

377
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,320
but her scores are off the chart.

378
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:37,960
Jeremy, you'll back me up.

379
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:38,960
I don't know, Nay.

380
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,960
There's nothing there that couldn't
have come out of the papers?

381
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:44,960
Well, I don't know. Isn't that
the point? Don't we have a duty?

382
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,960
To science? Certainly.

383
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,960
Yeah, but science doesn't exist in
a vacuum. We're part of this town.

384
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,960
There's no need for hysterics.

385
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:56,960
I'm not hysterical.
I'm worried, genuinely worried.

386
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,960
You said you'd consider this
seriously, but it's been months.

387
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:00,960
It really isn't any of our concern.

388
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,800
But it will be if something happens

389
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,320
and it gets out
we've withheld information.

390
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,480
But it won't.
Won't what?

391
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,960
Won't happen or won't get out?
Either.

392
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,960
Now, really, I am very busy.

393
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,000
It don't sit right with me,
you do know that, don't you?

394
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,960
Not being able to
close the book on it.

395
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,960
I don't care for it
any more than you do.

396
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,960
You've just got to be patient.

397
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:48,960
Keep your powder dry.
We'll get him.

398
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:49,960
I know.

399
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,960
Oh, I tried to call
Miss Thursday at Welfare,

400
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:59,480
just about Molly Andrews' daughter.
They said she's on secondment.

401
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,960
That's right. Win did say.

402
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:04,960
Four months. Six months. Something.

403
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,160
Talk to Viv Wall.

404
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:09,960
She'll see you right
about the kiddie. I will.

405
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,960
Monday morning, then.

406
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,960
Mind how you go.
Mm-hm.

407
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,960
Oh, I thought you'd gone home.

408
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,320
No.

409
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,960
Can you lock up, then?

410
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,960
He's right, you know.

411
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,960
It's none of our business.

412
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:22,960
Something like that's
never anyone's business.

413
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:23,960
Till it's everyone's.

414
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,960
I thought you were on my side.

415
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,960
Is this about...?
No.

416
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:32,960
Good heavens, no.

417
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:36,960
Then, why?

418
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:42,480
You'll always be on the outside,
you know.

419
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:46,960
Snotty grammar school nose
pressed against the pane.

420
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,960
They'll never let you in their club,

421
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,960
no matter however often
you take their part.

422
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,960
I'm sorry.

423
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:58,960
Me too.

424
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,800
Morse.

425
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,640
'I have Doctor Benford
on the line for you.'

426
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,960
Put him through.

427
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:34,960
FEMALE VOICE: 'Hello?'
Doctor Benford? How can I help?

428
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:37,960
'I'm calling about the woman
killed in the towpath at New Year,

429
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,320
'Molly Andrews?'

430
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:40,960
Oh, yes.

431
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,960
What was it you wanted to say?

432
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:45,480
'One of my test subjects...

433
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,960
'Actually, can we
meet somewhere tomorrow?'

434
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,960
Well, this is something.

435
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:03,960
Yes.
Yes, it is. Naomi Benford.

436
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:06,960
Dorothea Frazil. Oxford Mail.

437
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:07,960
You making a speech?

438
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,960
A speech? Me? No. No,
I wouldn't know how.

439
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:12,160
I'm just, er, saying a few words.

440
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:14,960
I'd love an interview
with the organisers,

441
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,960
even just a quote,
do you know them?

442
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,960
Yeah, of course.
It's Arielle, Sheila and Sally.

443
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,960
I can introduce you.
Oh, fantastic.

444
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:25,960
Hi, sorry, can I introduce
Dorothea Frazil. Oxford Mail.

445
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,480
Sally Alexander, I presume.

446
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:30,960
Sorry. Excuse me, just a minute.

447
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,960
The creche is just along the hall.

448
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:38,160
I'm sorry? The creche.
The chaps are running it today,

449
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:41,320
if that's what you're looking for.
No, I'm here to see a Dr Benford.

450
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:43,960
You're the policeman.
That's correct.

451
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,000
Erm...

452
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:49,960
..I might have
spoken out of turn last night.

453
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:50,960
Prematurely, at least.

454
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,960
Well, how's that?

455
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,960
I'm afraid my blood was up
when I telephoned.

456
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:58,960
You are aware there's an offence
of wasting police time?

457
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,960
I'm sorry, but there are
professional protocols

458
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,480
I'm obliged to observe
before I can speak freely.

459
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,960
If you have any information
about what happened

460
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:06,960
on the towpath at New Year,

461
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,960
you have an obligation
to tell the police.

462
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,960
And I'm sorry,
but it's not my story to tell.

463
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:14,960
There are people I need to talk to,
well, a person.

464
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,960
I'm speaking to them this afternoon.
Right.

465
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,480
I can't betray a confidence.
I'm sorry.

466
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,960
This you for the weekend, is it?
Some of it.

467
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,960
At four, I've more of this
dreadful cat business.

468
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:32,640
Cats going missing,
and then turning up...

469
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:33,960
all...

470
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,480
Oh, it's too horrible.

471
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:37,960
One for the RSPCA, no doubt.

472
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:41,960
So as you can see,
my dance card is positively chocker.

473
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:46,960
What is it that you're all hoping
to be liberated from, exactly?

474
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:49,960
Is it just the dishes,
or light housekeeping in general?

475
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:52,960
Patriarchal hegemony, in the main.

476
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:56,960
Ah. Freedom from the tyranny of the
squeezy bottle's just an adjunct.

477
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,960
Speaking of which,
how are you settling in

478
00:35:58,960 --> 00:35:59,960
to this new place of yours?

479
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,800
Urgh, slowly.

480
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,960
I'm still waiting
to hear about Venice.

481
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:06,160
Streets are filled with water.

482
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,800
Stop press (!)

483
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:10,960
What about you?
You've clearly plans?

484
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,960
Oh, I shall be oppressing
someone somewhere, I expect.

485
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:16,480
Keeping the chauvinist end up.
Mm.

486
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:19,960
Otherwise, I'll take my comforts
where I can. "Music hath charms."

487
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:20,960
Have a nice weekend.

488
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,960
You're sure?

489
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,960
I didn't think it was right
to speak on your behalf,

490
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,960
not without asking you first.

491
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:49,960
No, no. You know,

492
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,960
I wanted to go to them
in the first place. I just...

493
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,640
wanted to do it the right way.

494
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,000
Will they believe me?

495
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,960
He seemed pretty decent.

496
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:01,000
Slightly bad tempered, but then,
he did think I was wasting his time,

497
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,960
so I guess that's understandable.

498
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:06,160
I did get the impression he
wanted to get to the bottom of this.

499
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,960
I'll just feel better
once they know.

500
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,960
I'm sure I will.
SHE SIGHS

501
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,640
It's just, er...

502
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:14,960
..a weight on me.

503
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,480
I know.

504
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:18,960
I've been meaning to thank you.

505
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,960
For what?

506
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,960
For believing me.

507
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:27,000
It's going to be all right.

508
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,640
I promise.

509
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,480
Oh!

510
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,960
Excuse me.

511
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,960
Stop! Stop!

512
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,800
Careful!

513
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:21,960
Are you all right?

514
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,960
It's, erm...

515
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:30,960
Morse.

516
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,960
..Morse! Of course!
Forgive me.

517
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,960
English names.

518
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,960
I'm sorry, have we met?

519
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:39,960
Ludo. We were up at the same time.

520
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:42,960
I was at Beaufort,
and you were at... erm...

521
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,640
No, wait, don't tell me.

522
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:45,960
I was at Lonsdale.

523
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:48,960
Lonsdale, yes! Please,
allow me to stand you a drink?

524
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,800
Oh no. I'm fine, thank you.

525
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:51,960
No, look, I insist.

526
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:54,960
I have some small connection
to this afternoon's entertainment,

527
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,960
which, in a manner of speaking,
makes you my guest.

528
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,960
Frivolous.
It is NOT scientific work!

529
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:22,960
It's NOT important.

530
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,960
This... this is...
demeans us all, I'm sorry.

531
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,960
Donald, I think you're
being unreasonable.

532
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,960
Oh, sorry.

533
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,960
It'll keep. If you're in
the middle of something.

534
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,160
I can...
No, we're not.

535
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:34,960
Donald.

536
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:38,960
Do you know about this?

537
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,960
Oh, I might've heard
something about it.

538
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:43,960
Well, you might have told me.

539
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,960
You know,
this is a serious department.

540
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,960
We are engaged upon serious work.

541
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:50,800
The Bursar's already making
noises about funding.

542
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,960
Something like this
could turn us into a laughing stock.

543
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,960
You enjoyed the concert?

544
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,960
Very much.

545
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:09,960
Music is my life. My grand passion.

546
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,960
Second only to the dogged pursuit
of beautiful women.

547
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,960
MORSE LAUGHS
You would say this,

548
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:15,960
"dogged pursuit," in English?
Yes, we would.

549
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:18,960
Well, there we are,
such are the articles of my faith.

550
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,960
The only ones I acknowledge,
in any event.

551
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:21,960
There are much worse.

552
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,960
Ah, none better.
CHUCKLES

553
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:24,960
And now I am hungry.

554
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,320
Shall we have supper?

555
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:28,640
Oh, well...
I shall brook no refusal.

556
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,320
There's a little place I know.

557
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,960
You'll love it.

558
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:39,960
Cross.

559
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,960
Wavy lines.

560
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:55,960
Triangle.

561
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:57,960
TV ANNOUNCER: League Division One.

562
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:00,960
Cambridge - nil, Lincoln - one.

563
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,960
Oxford - one, Birmingham - nil.

564
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,960
Leicester - four,
Manchester...

565
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,960
Not like you to miss the results.

566
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,320
..Ipswich - two,
Carlisle...

567
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:10,960
Right. Work.

568
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,480
..Northampton - one,
Halifax - two.

569
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:13,960
Er, it's work. The, er...

570
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,960
..the girl up the towpath
at New Year.

571
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:22,960
Mr Bright's asked Morse
to take a look at it.

572
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,960
Make sure
there's nothing I've missed.

573
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,960
Morse?

574
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:30,960
Well, I'm not sure what
I think about that, I'm sure.

575
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,960
Don't mean anything.

576
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:35,800
Standard practice, that's all.

577
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,800
Ah...

578
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,960
I bought a couple of canaries
down the market.

579
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:48,960
A pair, a cock and hen.
We might get some chicks.

580
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,640
Might we?

581
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,800
I used to keep birds
when I was a boy.

582
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,960
Well, look after them
for the old man.

583
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:58,000
I thought it might be...

584
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,960
Something. An interest.

585
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,320
Feathers everywhere.

586
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,960
It's not feathers everywhere.

587
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,960
And if it is,
I'll... I'll see to it.

588
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,960
It's two birds.

589
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:09,960
They're not gonna bother you.

590
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:11,960
Well, where're we going to put them?

591
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:13,960
Where we going to keep them?
Up my arse, Winifred.

592
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:15,960
That's where gonna keep them.
Up my arse.

593
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:17,960
Like David Nixon.

594
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:19,960
I'm just asking.

595
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:21,320
No need for language.

596
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:24,800
In a cage, where d'you think?

597
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,960
I just saw them, and I wanted them,
and I bought them.

598
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:27,960
And that's it, and that's all.

599
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:30,960
I thought it might be
something nice. Something not...

600
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:33,960
..blood and cruelty.

601
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:37,000
And hatred.

602
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:41,960
What one person will do to another,
you've no idea.

603
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:52,960
Just gets you down sometimes,
that's all.

604
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:59,160
Another bottle?

605
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:00,960
Oh, no.

606
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:04,960
Well, what a day.

607
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:06,960
We have a saying in my country,

608
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,960
"Do not praise the day
before sunset."

609
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:10,640
Which country is that?

610
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:13,960
War has redrawn national borders
so many times

611
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:16,320
as to make such notions
an irrelevance.

612
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:18,960
I prefer to say
I'm a man of the world.

613
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:21,960
And what is it you do in the world?

614
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:23,960
Travel mostly.

615
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:25,640
My family's in shipping.

616
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:27,960
Since before Vasco da Gama.
LAUGHS

617
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:32,960
I look after the various arms
of our charitable foundation.

618
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:35,000
I buy and sell beautiful things.
Artwork.

619
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,960
I have a music festival.
And you?

620
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:40,960
Oh, nothing quite so interesting.

621
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:42,320
I'm a policeman.

622
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:43,960
Truly?
Mm-hm.

623
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:47,640
But you seem a man of refinement.
Of great taste.

624
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:50,960
Not at all a lumpen,
plodding, petty official.

625
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:52,320
Ah, I've offended you.

626
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:55,960
I meant, of course,
those policemen not in England.

627
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:58,800
Have you travelled
much in the continent?

628
00:43:58,800 --> 00:43:59,960
Oh, a little.

629
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:01,960
So, you will know
the border officials

630
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:04,640
and provincial policemen
are one of two types.

631
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:06,960
The dull,
everything-by-the book sort

632
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:10,960
And those who understand the only
international language worth a damn.

633
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:13,960
Which type are you?

634
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:14,960
The former. Definitely.

635
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:17,960
Incorruptible? Is that it?
That's right.

636
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:19,960
Every man has his price.

637
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:20,960
HALF-LAUGH
Every man.

638
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:23,640
I shall make it my life's
business to find yours.

639
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:24,960
And once I have found your weakness,

640
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:27,320
I shall exploit it without mercy
to my own ends.

641
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:28,960
And what is that?

642
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:31,960
I shall think of something.
HE LAUGHS

643
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:33,960
And what about you?

644
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:35,960
What's your weakness?

645
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:38,960
My weakness?

646
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:40,960
My weakness left me.

647
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,960
Ah...

648
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:46,960
I see. I'm sorry.

649
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:54,480
Perfect.

650
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:30,960
Bridget?

651
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:52,320
Department Of Latent Potential.

652
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:53,960
Some sort of science research lab.

653
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:57,960
Attached to Cardinal College,
so far as I can make out.

654
00:45:57,960 --> 00:45:59,480
Who's the deceased?

655
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:00,960
Dr Naomi Benford.

656
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:02,480
28 years old.

657
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:06,160
What?
She's just so young.

658
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:07,960
Did you know her?

659
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:08,960
I saw her about once or twice.

660
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:11,960
You know, early bird.
But not to speak to.

661
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:13,960
You're all right though?
Yeah.

662
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:17,480
It was Reet's granddaughter,
Bridget, that found her, not me.

663
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:18,960
It's you I'm married to.

664
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:22,960
I saw worse on fire watch,
in the war. Really.

665
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:23,960
I'm fine.

666
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:26,800
Now, go on. Do your job.

667
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:35,960
She'd just been picked
to be on the television

668
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:37,960
for some new academic
broadcasting programme.

669
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:39,960
There's a bit in the Mail today.

670
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:42,320
Interview, she did with Miss Frazil.

671
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:43,960
Family?

672
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:46,960
Penge. Locals are notifying them.

673
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:48,960
But she had a flat in North Oxford.

674
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:52,960
Multiple catastrophic injuries

675
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:57,960
consistent with a high fall
onto an unyielding surface.

676
00:46:57,960 --> 00:46:59,960
Have to wait on the post-mortem

677
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:02,960
to establish
exactly which killed her,

678
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:06,960
but there's perimortem hematoma
to both upper arms.

679
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:09,960
Someone gripped her by the biceps,

680
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:11,960
firmly enough to bruise,

681
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:13,800
within moments of her decease.

682
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:17,960
When?

683
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:19,960
Saturday evening, sometime?

684
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:22,960
Watch is stopped,
just after eight to twelve.

685
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:25,960
You think this is connected
to Molly Andrews?

686
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:27,960
Don't you?

687
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:31,000
So, she calls the station
Friday night,

688
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,480
claiming to have information
on the Towpath Killer.

689
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:35,960
Only when I see her on Saturday,
at Ruskin, she's got cold feet

690
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:37,640
and says she needs
to speak to someone

691
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:39,800
before she can disclose
anything she knows.

692
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:40,960
And now she's dead.

693
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:45,160
Somebody's killed her before she can
spill what she knew about Molly.

694
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:47,960
Somebody here.

695
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:49,960
Who's in charge of this place?

696
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:54,960
Head man's a Professor,
Sir Donald Blish.

697
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:56,960
He's got tutorials this afternoon,

698
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:58,960
and never comes in
on a Monday morning,

699
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:00,960
but one of the junior men is in.

700
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:03,960
A Dr Jeremy Kreitsek.

701
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:06,960
What is it you do here,
Doctor Kreitsek?

702
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:10,960
We're examining certain aspects
of human consciousness.

703
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:12,480
Psychic phenomena.

704
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:15,960
Telekinesis.
ESP - Extra Sensory Perception.

705
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:18,800
Telaesthesia -
travelling clairvoyance

706
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:20,480
or remote viewing,
if you prefer.

707
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:22,320
Some people
call it distant seeing,

708
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:24,960
but it all means the same thing.
Which is what?

709
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:29,960
A subject will be able to focus in
on places they've never even been.

710
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:31,960
Could be next door
or on the other side of the world,

711
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:34,960
and describe it
with great clarity and detail.

712
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:36,960
All in their mind's eye.

713
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:39,480
People too,
that have never even met.

714
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:41,160
So, do you get paid for this?

715
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:43,960
I'm sure that to a layman

716
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:46,960
it all sounds like
a whole lot of mumbo jumbo,

717
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:48,960
but Faraday was an early researcher.

718
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:50,960
Sir William Crookes,
Rufus Osgood Mason.

719
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:53,960
They all believed the mind
contains vast, untapped powers.

720
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:58,960
What's all this?

721
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:00,960
So?

722
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:03,960
It's Naomi.
There's been some sort of accident.

723
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:05,640
The stairwell.

724
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:09,960
I don't know what happened,
but she's... she's dead.

725
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:12,960
These gentlemen are with the police.

726
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:15,960
What? No, that can't be right.

727
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:17,960
I'm afraid it is. Dr...?

728
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:19,320
Ferman.

729
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:22,800
We'll need an account
of everyone's movements

730
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:25,960
between Saturday afternoon
and Sunday morning.

731
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:28,800
Well, I was in the pub
on Saturday night.

732
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:31,960
I'm afraid what I did see
of Sunday was beneath an eiderdown.

733
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:33,480
Which pub?

734
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:35,960
The Baby And The Bird.

735
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:36,960
The Turl.

736
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:38,960
And, well, after that
it gets a bit hazy.

737
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:40,160
Anyone vouch for you?

738
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:43,320
Bar staff, I suppose.

739
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:46,960
What about you, Doctor Kreitsek?

740
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:48,960
I was at The Tunnel, Saturday night.

741
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:49,960
It's a folk club.

742
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:51,960
Oh, yeah. Who was on?

743
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:54,960
Who was playing?
Mm-hm.

744
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:55,960
Chap called Thackeray, I like.

745
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:57,960
Seen him at Braden's Week.

746
00:49:57,960 --> 00:49:59,000
I've seen him a couple of times.

747
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Doctor Benford been with you long?

748
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,960
Since, um, about autumn.

749
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:05,960
What was her role here?

750
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:08,800
Junior research fellow.

751
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:10,960
Naomi carried out
a number of our experiments.

752
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:12,960
What sort of experiments?

753
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:17,960
The subject undergoes
a period of sensory deprivation.

754
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:19,960
A red light is shone
on ping-pong balls,

755
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:22,960
which are cut in half
and placed over the eyes.

756
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:25,000
At the same time,
headphones play white noise.

757
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,960
What's the game there, then?

758
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:30,640
Well, the idea is to clear the mind
of any external stimuli

759
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:32,960
in order that the subject might
become more receptive,

760
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:35,960
more attuned to their
extra sensory potential.

761
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:37,960
And do they?

762
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:39,960
Some, yeah.

763
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:41,960
Once the subject
is suitably prepared,

764
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:44,960
the tester turns through
a collection of flash cards

765
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:46,960
which show various
geometric symbols.

766
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:49,960
Like, er, triangles, squares,
circles, wavy lines and that.

767
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:51,960
The subject tries to see
what's on the cards.

768
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:52,960
Triangle.

769
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:55,960
Anything in it?

770
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:57,960
Some subjects show
an above average aptitude

771
00:50:57,960 --> 00:50:59,960
for correctly
identifying the symbols.

772
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:02,960
And some subjects show
a below average aptitude, I assume.

773
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:04,480
Given the nature of averages.

774
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:08,960
Look, the government show us a lot
of respect for the work we do here.

775
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:12,960
Perhaps you might want to extend
the same respect that it warrants.

776
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:14,960
Well, to get back
to the matter in hand,

777
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:18,960
did Dr Benford have a boyfriend,
or...?

778
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:20,960
Not so far as I know.

779
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:21,960
Well, I can't say we were close.

780
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:23,960
When did you last see her?

781
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:25,640
Saturday afternoon.

782
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:26,960
Here?

783
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:31,960
Doctor?

784
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:39,960
Good morning.

785
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:41,960
Detective Sergeant Morse -
Chief Inspector Thursday.

786
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:44,640
From Thames Valley.
We're looking for a Professor Blish.

787
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:46,960
Donald. My husband.

788
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:48,960
He's in the garden.
Won't you come in?

789
00:51:57,960 --> 00:51:59,960
Thought I heard the door.

790
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:01,000
The police, darling.

791
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,960
Someone at college has died.

792
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:04,960
A Dr Benford?

793
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:06,960
Naomi?
I'm afraid so, sir.

794
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:10,480
Detective Chief Inspector Thursday,
Detective Sergeant Morse.

795
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:12,960
Would you like tea,
or something stronger?

796
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:15,320
Thank you, Mrs Blish,
we won't if it's all the same.

797
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:16,960
Sorry...

798
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:20,800
Darling, if I could just trouble you
for a cheque for Querels

799
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:21,960
and then I'll be out of your hair.

800
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:25,960
I've made out the amount.

801
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:28,960
The butchers.

802
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:31,320
Only, I'm not allowed
my own chequebook.

803
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:33,960
In case my head explodes
and falls off (!)

804
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:35,320
Quite right.

805
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:37,960
Do you let your wife
have her own chequebook?

806
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:41,960
I know it's all the fashion,
but money, seems to me, a man's job.

807
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:42,960
There we are, darling.

808
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:44,960
If there's anything you want,
just shout.

809
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:48,960
At the Department, you say?

810
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:51,960
Poor girl.

811
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:53,960
But how? I don't understand.

812
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:55,960
Was there some sort of accident,
or...?

813
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:57,960
A fall, sir, but hopefully,
with your help,

814
00:52:57,960 --> 00:52:59,960
we'll be able to get
to the bottom of it.

815
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:01,960
When did you last
see Dr Benford?

816
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:04,960
Saturday, it would have been.

817
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:06,960
Half-past five or thereabouts.

818
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:11,960
She'd been over at Ruskin in the
morning for this women's conference,

819
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:13,960
and then came in for a few hours
after lunch.

820
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:16,000
Was there anyone with her
when you left?

821
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,960
Not that I saw.

822
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:20,960
But I wouldn't expect anyone
to be in the lab much after that.

823
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:22,960
She said she had
some work to finish.

824
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:28,960
Did she ever mention a young woman
killed on the towpath at New Year?

825
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:30,960
Molly Andrews.

826
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:32,960
She was a barmaid at The Grapes.

827
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:36,960
I read about it, of course.

828
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:38,480
Awful thing. But I...

829
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:40,960
I don't remember Naomi
ever mentioning it.

830
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:43,960
Really?

831
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:47,960
Only, she intimated that there
were some professional protocol

832
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:50,960
that she were obliged to follow,
before being able to discuss it.

833
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:53,960
I'm afraid I'm at a loss to explain
what she might have meant by that.

834
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:57,960
We have it that you quarrelled
with her on Saturday afternoon.

835
00:53:57,960 --> 00:54:01,960
Well, I wouldn't call it a quarrel.
We had a frank exchange of views.

836
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:03,960
You upset her, supposedly.

837
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:07,960
Really? Well,
I'm afraid it doesn't take much.

838
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:09,960
They don't respond well
to criticism.

839
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:11,960
What was the nature
of this criticism?

840
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:15,960
I felt she had become
less than rigorous in her work.

841
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:17,960
Her mind was on
this television business.

842
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:18,960
You disapproved?

843
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:23,960
One can either be a serious academic
or a frivolous person.

844
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:27,640
On the whole, I think women are too
emotional for the life scientific.

845
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:29,960
That will come as grave news
to Madam Curie, I'm sure.

846
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:31,480
SCOFFS
Hm, well...

847
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:32,960
I'm not sure I'd offer up someone

848
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:34,960
who managed to give themselves
radiation poisoning

849
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:36,960
as a shining example.

850
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:38,960
They just get under your feet
in the lab.

851
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:40,960
If they're not crying about
who they do love,

852
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:43,960
they're crying about
who doesn't love them.

853
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:45,960
It's a distraction.

854
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:48,960
There's a don like that in every
other common room in Oxford.

855
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:50,960
His experience of the
other half of humankind

856
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:52,960
starts with matron
and doesn't get much further.

857
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:54,960
Women are only good
for ironing their shirts

858
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:56,960
and making sure the cruet's filled
at the high table.

859
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:59,960
Anything in it, d'you think?
This, er, sixth sense business.

860
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:01,960
I've always had it down
for a load of old baloney.

861
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:04,960
I mean, if you had the gift
of second sight, or whatever it is,

862
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:06,960
you'd be down the bookies,
wouldn't you,

863
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:08,960
not trying to see what Mr Brezhnev's
got in his briefcase.

864
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:10,960
Yes, but we all get
feelings don't we?

865
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:12,960
Like what you had
about Carl Sturgis,

866
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:15,800
only we call them hunches.
That's experience, though, isn't it?

867
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:17,960
It's not something
from the great beyond.

868
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:19,960
Mrs Blish.
Hm.

869
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:47,960
BIRD CAWS

870
00:55:57,960 --> 00:55:59,960
It's always the ones you like.

871
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:02,960
I read your piece.
What do you make of her?

872
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:04,960
Clever, beautiful, funny.

873
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:06,960
Excited about the television.

874
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:08,960
Whoever hired her
knew what they were doing. How so?

875
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:10,960
Well, they could have
hired some dusty old don,

876
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:12,640
no-one would have turned a hair,

877
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:14,960
but put an intelligent
young woman on screen...

878
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:15,960
SHE TUTS

879
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:17,960
Was she attached?

880
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:19,480
She said not.

881
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:21,160
Was it an accident?

882
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:23,000
Well, that's what
I'm here to find out.

883
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,960
She did ask me, off the record,

884
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:27,960
if I'd heard anything
about the towpath at New Year.

885
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:29,960
The barmaid at The Grapes.

886
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:31,480
Such as?

887
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:34,960
Oh, anything the police might've
been keeping from the public.

888
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:37,960
Seemed a strange thing to ask.
Hm.

889
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:39,960
Did she say
what her interest would be?

890
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:40,960
SHE SIGHS

891
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:42,960
Behalf of a friend, she said.

892
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:44,960
You think that's connected?

893
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:46,960
Oh, really, I couldn't say.

894
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:50,960
And any avoidance of speculation
in print ahead of a formal statement

895
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:52,640
would be greatly appreciated.

896
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:53,960
It'll cost you.

897
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:55,960
Oh, it always does. But, thank you.

898
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:58,640
Just make sure you get the bastard.

899
00:56:58,640 --> 00:56:59,960
She was all right.

900
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:39,960
Where's all this come from?

901
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:43,960
The handbag. Pen was under her body.

902
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:45,960
A few bits and pieces
had fallen out,

903
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:48,960
lipstick, a compact, address book.

904
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:50,960
Anything else?
Afraid not.

905
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:53,960
Hmm...

906
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:56,960
According to the diary
at her flat,

907
00:57:56,960 --> 00:57:58,960
Dr Benford was supposed to meet
a Jennifer Tate

908
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:00,960
on Saturday at eight o'clock.

909
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:01,960
A friend?

910
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:04,320
Well, if she was,
she wasn't a close one.

911
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:05,960
There's no address for her
in the book.

912
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:09,960
Doctor Benford had also asked
Dorothea Frazil,

913
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:11,960
if there was anything she'd heard of

914
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:14,960
that we'd kept back from the public
about the towpath killing.

915
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:16,960
She had clippings
related to the case upon her desk.

916
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:20,320
And in her appointment book,
next to Jennifer Tate,

917
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:22,960
she'd written, "Regarding MA."

918
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:24,800
Molly Andrews?

919
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:27,960
Well, that would be my guess.

920
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:30,960
CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYS

921
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:34,960
DOORBELL

922
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:44,960
I was in the neighbourhood.

923
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:46,960
If it's a bad time?

924
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:50,640
No. No, no.
Um, come in, come in.

925
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:54,800
It's the second on the left.

926
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:02,960
I don't get many visitors.

927
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:04,960
I like what you've done
with the place.

928
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:06,160
You might want to let that breathe.

929
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:11,960
Well, I'm afraid
I've a very limited cellar.

930
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:14,320
But, erm, I've a reasonable bottle
of everyday wants finishing

931
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:15,960
while we wait.

932
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:17,960
Perfect.

933
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:30,960
Oh, my God!

934
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:35,320
You have the Calloway
'54 Traviata from La Scala.

935
00:59:35,320 --> 00:59:36,960
I've never heard it.

936
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:38,320
Very few have.

937
00:59:38,320 --> 00:59:39,960
It's a test pressing.

938
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:42,480
They were trying out
some new recording system.

939
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:43,960
Can I hear it?

940
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:47,800
Well, you can have it.

941
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:48,960
You are joking, I can have it?

942
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:49,960
Do you know how rare it is?

943
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:51,960
No, I haven't listened to it
for years.

944
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:53,960
I'd sooner it went to
a good home. Cheers!

945
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:02,960
So, to what do I owe the, er..?

946
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:05,320
I'm having a few people around
to my place at the weekend.

947
01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:07,960
A few drinks. I haven't seen you.

948
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:09,960
Oh, yes, I've just been busy.
With work.

949
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:11,960
What devilish conundrum
currently occupies the mind

950
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:13,480
of the great detective?

951
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:18,960
Murder in pursuit of robbery.

952
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:21,960
What makes you say that?

953
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:25,000
Her necklace.

954
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:27,960
That's what he took.

955
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:30,800
That's what made those marks
on her neck.

956
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:31,960
The chain, as he tore it away.

957
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:36,960
We were occupied... during the war.

958
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:40,960
There was a girl.

959
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:43,960
Young girl,
daughter of one of our staff.

960
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:45,480
14? 15?

961
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:49,960
She wore a St Christopher.

962
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:52,960
One of the soldiers, erm...

963
01:00:55,960 --> 01:00:57,960
Playing in the woods,
I found her body.

964
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:01,960
The marks on her neck
were like this.

965
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:07,160
I'm sorry, I have never
told anyone that story before.

966
01:01:08,320 --> 01:01:10,000
I, erm...

967
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,960
I had forgotten it
until I saw that.

968
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:16,960
Can't... I can't imagine.

969
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:22,960
No. You know,
I think that's why I'm drawn...

970
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:24,960
to the beautiful things in life.

971
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:26,960
DOORBELL

972
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:30,960
Well... Excuse me.

973
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,320
Oh, sorry, matey,
I didn't realise you had company.

974
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:42,960
Erm, this is my colleague,

975
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:43,960
Detective Sergeant Strange.

976
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:45,960
This is my friend Ludo.
Ludo. Strange.

977
01:01:45,960 --> 01:01:47,960
Jim.

978
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:50,960
Ooh, see you've got the record out,
then?

979
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:52,960
Can't go wrong.

980
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,960
So, how'd you know our Morse, then?

981
01:01:55,960 --> 01:01:57,960
Oh, we were up at Oxford
at the same time.

982
01:01:57,960 --> 01:02:01,960
Oh, were you? I've been up in Oxford
with him the last five years.

983
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:03,960
Well, up and down.

984
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:06,960
LAUGHS
Cowley for the most part.

985
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:07,960
Castle Gate now.

986
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:11,960
Do you mind if I borrowed him
for a minute? It's er... It's work.

987
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:12,960
Excuse us.

988
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:20,160
Well, I've got a work address
for this Tate girl

989
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:22,960
that Doctor Benford was due to see,
Friday night.

990
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:24,160
Thought you'd wanna know.

991
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:25,960
In case it was important.
Mm.

992
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:29,960
Well, that was all.

993
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:31,960
I won't stop if you've got company.

994
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:34,960
Don't worry about seeing me out.
I know the way.

995
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:36,320
It's nice to meet you.

996
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:40,960
Anything from the TV people?

997
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:42,640
Nothing that won't keep.

998
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:46,960
Look, I didn't like to say anything
in front of your mate,

999
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:48,960
but we've talked about this.

1000
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:49,960
You can't be bringing work home.

1001
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:51,960
Not evidence, you can't.

1002
01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:54,960
Orderly running of the office
is my responsibility now.

1003
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:56,960
Anything goes missing, it's my neck.

1004
01:02:58,160 --> 01:03:00,960
Just think on.

1005
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:01,960
Have a good night.

1006
01:03:07,960 --> 01:03:08,960
DOOR SHUTS

1007
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:11,960
It's about Dr Benford, Miss Tate.

1008
01:03:11,960 --> 01:03:14,320
I thought it must be.

1009
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:15,960
How's that?

1010
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:18,000
Well, Naomi said it'd be passed
to the police months ago.

1011
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,960
Right after it happened.

1012
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:21,960
What would?

1013
01:03:21,960 --> 01:03:23,640
What I told her.

1014
01:03:23,640 --> 01:03:26,960
About the girl on the towpath
at New Year.

1015
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:28,320
What did you tell her?

1016
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:29,960
What I saw.

1017
01:03:31,960 --> 01:03:32,960
The man who did it.

1018
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:35,960
You saw who killed Molly Andrews?

1019
01:03:35,960 --> 01:03:37,960
You were on the Towpath that night?

1020
01:03:37,960 --> 01:03:40,960
No. Not exactly.

1021
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:42,960
What do you mean?
You said you saw who did it?

1022
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:44,960
Yes, I did, like...

1023
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:47,960
..in my head.

1024
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:51,640
It was a vision.

1025
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:55,960
Well, we're very grateful
for your assistance, miss.

1026
01:03:55,960 --> 01:03:57,960
SHE SIGHS
You don't believe me.

1027
01:03:57,960 --> 01:04:00,480
We're the police,
we need evidence.

1028
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:01,960
Physical evidence.

1029
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:05,960
He took her necklace, didn't he?

1030
01:04:05,960 --> 01:04:07,640
We're not at liberty...
Yes.

1031
01:04:07,640 --> 01:04:08,960
Why? What else did you see?

1032
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:10,960
Did you see his face?

1033
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:12,960
No.

1034
01:04:13,960 --> 01:04:15,160
But I felt him.

1035
01:04:15,160 --> 01:04:18,960
This... anger.

1036
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:21,960
This hatred.

1037
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:22,960
Something evil.

1038
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:26,960
And the taste, I could...

1039
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:30,960
..taste it in my mouth,
on my tongue.

1040
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:32,960
Taste what?

1041
01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:36,960
Blood.

1042
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:41,960
Blood?

1043
01:04:41,960 --> 01:04:44,480
That's what she said, sir.

1044
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:46,960
There was no blood.

1045
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:48,480
Not at the scene.

1046
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:50,160
Certainly, none from Molly Andrews.

1047
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:52,960
Is it possible, do you think?

1048
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:56,960
This girl could literally have seen

1049
01:04:56,960 --> 01:04:58,960
what passed on the towpath
that night?

1050
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:01,960
Well, I'm not one
for the macabre, sir.

1051
01:05:03,960 --> 01:05:07,160
The way she described it all...

1052
01:05:07,160 --> 01:05:11,960
Maybe you'd have had to have been
there, but she did seem sincere,

1053
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:14,960
if you're at all susceptible
to that way of thinking.

1054
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:16,960
Susceptible or not,
she knew about the necklace.

1055
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:18,960
It's that which caused the marks
to Molly Andrews's neck.

1056
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:20,480
The killer tore it from her.

1057
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:23,960
A keepsake, perhaps?

1058
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:26,960
And what of this
television programme

1059
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:29,960
that Doctor Benford
was involved with, anything there?

1060
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:31,960
I spoke to the producer, sir.

1061
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:33,960
A chap called Ray Douglas.

1062
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:37,960
Quite flamboyant, as is often
the way with these people,

1063
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:40,960
but in his words
Doctor Benford was a natural.

1064
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:42,960
She had a...

1065
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:48,960
Yeah, here we are.

1066
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:51,960
"She had a very easy rapport
with the camera

1067
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:54,480
"and the camera loved her.

1068
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:56,960
"I think we knew
as soon as we saw her

1069
01:05:56,960 --> 01:05:59,960
"that we'd found our presenter
for the Higher Maths module."

1070
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:02,480
Did they interview
many people for the post?

1071
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:03,960
Audition.

1072
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:06,640
Hundreds, apparently.

1073
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:09,960
Anyone with a half decent science
degree in Oxford put in for it,

1074
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:11,960
including one or two
from her own department.

1075
01:06:13,960 --> 01:06:15,960
I just went along
to see what it was all about.

1076
01:06:15,960 --> 01:06:17,960
Didn't expect to get
very far with it at all.

1077
01:06:17,960 --> 01:06:19,960
I wasn't disappointed.

1078
01:06:19,960 --> 01:06:21,960
I think I knew at once
that I wasn't the sort of thing

1079
01:06:21,960 --> 01:06:23,960
they were looking for.
That none of us were.

1080
01:06:23,960 --> 01:06:25,960
How's that?

1081
01:06:25,960 --> 01:06:28,960
Sex, isn't it?
That's what it's all about nowadays.

1082
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:30,960
That's what sells.
Sex appeal.

1083
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:33,960
I mean, why bother hiring a fella
who knows what he's talking about

1084
01:06:33,960 --> 01:06:35,960
when you can put a pair
of knockers on screen?

1085
01:06:35,960 --> 01:06:37,960
For an academic programme?

1086
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:39,960
For anything, my boy.

1087
01:06:39,960 --> 01:06:41,960
From soap suds to Japanese cars.

1088
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:44,960
You see it at the motor show,
at the boat show, in the papers now.

1089
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:47,960
I mean, it's not us blokes they've
got sprawled all over everything,

1090
01:06:47,960 --> 01:06:49,960
showing the world
what we've got, is it?

1091
01:06:49,960 --> 01:06:50,960
I think that's a bit unnecessary.

1092
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:52,800
I won't have you talking
smut about her.

1093
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:54,960
We were friends.
Ha, friends!

1094
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:57,480
Jeremy had a soft spot for her,
didn't you, eh?

1095
01:06:57,480 --> 01:06:58,960
Well soft-ish (!)

1096
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:00,960
Asked her out the week
she started, didn't you?

1097
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:03,960
But she turned him down flat.
Shame (!)

1098
01:07:05,960 --> 01:07:06,960
You never mentioned.

1099
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:09,960
I asked her out once, for a drink.

1100
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:11,960
She said no.

1101
01:07:11,960 --> 01:07:13,960
She was under no obligation anyway.

1102
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:17,960
I wasn't her type, clearly.
That's all there was to it.

1103
01:07:17,960 --> 01:07:19,960
Not her type? You didn't have
anything to offer her.

1104
01:07:19,960 --> 01:07:21,960
That's why you weren't her type.

1105
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:22,960
No leg up, no leg over.

1106
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:23,960
You wanna wake up, man.

1107
01:07:23,960 --> 01:07:25,960
It's not a battle of the sexes,
it's war, mate.

1108
01:07:25,960 --> 01:07:27,640
And they've got the bazookas.

1109
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:29,960
How's your poor little pea-shooter
gonna compete with that?

1110
01:07:29,960 --> 01:07:31,960
I'll tell you, it's not.

1111
01:07:43,640 --> 01:07:44,960
Sam.

1112
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:45,960
What is it?

1113
01:07:56,640 --> 01:07:59,960
We're proceeding upon the assumption
that, what?

1114
01:07:59,960 --> 01:08:01,960
The towpath killing
and the murder of Dr Benford

1115
01:08:01,960 --> 01:08:03,960
are the work of the same hand?

1116
01:08:03,960 --> 01:08:07,960
Potentially, sir. But in truth,
there's very little to go on.

1117
01:08:07,960 --> 01:08:09,960
Her colleagues at work?

1118
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:12,960
Only one of them
has a solid alibi, sir.

1119
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:13,960
Professor Blish.

1120
01:08:13,960 --> 01:08:15,960
At home with his wife.

1121
01:08:15,960 --> 01:08:19,800
He denied Dr Benford had mentioned
the towpath killing to him.

1122
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:20,960
If he'd lie about that...

1123
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:23,960
Well we've only really got
Jenny Tate's word to go on, sir.

1124
01:08:23,960 --> 01:08:28,800
You said Kreitsek had interviewed
for this television post

1125
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:29,960
and had been turned down?

1126
01:08:29,960 --> 01:08:31,960
Something in that?
Professional jealousy.

1127
01:08:31,960 --> 01:08:35,960
Hmm. Ferman seemed
rather bitter about it.

1128
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:39,960
Put her getting the job
down to her natural advantages.

1129
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:42,000
And Professor Blish?

1130
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
What was his position
with regard

1131
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:47,960
to Dr Benford's part
in these educational programmes?

1132
01:08:47,960 --> 01:08:48,960
Far as we could make out, sir,

1133
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:51,960
he's none too keen on having women
in his department at all.

1134
01:08:51,960 --> 01:08:53,960
Only had her there on sufferance.

1135
01:08:53,960 --> 01:08:56,320
Word just through
from Birmingham, sir.

1136
01:08:56,320 --> 01:08:58,960
Petrovski, the bargee who
passed through Braunston Junction

1137
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:00,960
in the early hours
of January 1st.

1138
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:04,000
Collapsed on his boat yesterday
afternoon near Gas Street Basin.

1139
01:09:07,960 --> 01:09:09,960
Apparently, he died
of alcohol poisoning.

1140
01:09:09,960 --> 01:09:14,960
Sister says he'd never hurt a fly,
but just couldn't resist a drink.

1141
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:16,960
Yeah, the place is full of empties.

1142
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:20,960
Look, I got a bone to pick with you.

1143
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:21,960
Oh, yeah?

1144
01:09:21,960 --> 01:09:25,320
I didn't think much to you
hanging the old man out to dry.

1145
01:09:25,320 --> 01:09:27,960
I've read the case files.

1146
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:30,160
The first 48 hours
of the Molly Andrews' investigation

1147
01:09:30,160 --> 01:09:31,960
were slipshod at best.

1148
01:09:31,960 --> 01:09:32,960
Slipshod?

1149
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:35,160
Yeah, all right, shabby, then,
if you'd sooner.

1150
01:09:35,160 --> 01:09:37,960
Poor record keeping.
Statements misfiled.

1151
01:09:37,960 --> 01:09:39,960
In short, it was a catalogue
of errors from start to finish.

1152
01:09:41,480 --> 01:09:44,960
We were short-handed,
with the New Year.

1153
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:46,960
You know Ainsley's
rubbish on exhibits.

1154
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:48,960
If you hadn't been on leave...

1155
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:50,960
Yeah, well, if people had
done their job in the first place,

1156
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:52,960
then perhaps Naomi Benford
might still be alive.

1157
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:56,960
Anyway, Molly's boyfriend,

1158
01:09:56,960 --> 01:09:59,160
Carl Sturgis?

1159
01:09:59,160 --> 01:10:00,960
I don't think so.

1160
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:03,960
Is it hers?

1161
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:17,960
So, you took her to the folk club
in November?

1162
01:10:17,960 --> 01:10:19,640
She kept the tickets.

1163
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:21,960
I really liked her.

1164
01:10:23,160 --> 01:10:24,960
All right, she was my kind of girl.

1165
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:28,960
What kind's that, then? Easy?

1166
01:10:28,960 --> 01:10:31,800
See, you're just like the tools
I work with.

1167
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:35,960
She wasn't easy or a pushover or any
of the other names you'd call her.

1168
01:10:35,960 --> 01:10:38,960
Then, why didn't you tell us about
your relationship with her?

1169
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:41,960
You've heard them rib me at work
over taking Naomi out.

1170
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:44,640
If they'd found out
I was seeing a barmaid

1171
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:45,960
that would've been the end of me.

1172
01:10:45,960 --> 01:10:47,160
How would they have known?

1173
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:51,160
She was a test subject, wasn't she?
At the lab.

1174
01:10:51,160 --> 01:10:53,960
No latent potential for ESP,
whatsoever.

1175
01:10:53,960 --> 01:10:55,960
Well, a complete brick.

1176
01:10:56,960 --> 01:10:59,960
Don kept her on
as a control group.

1177
01:10:59,960 --> 01:11:03,960
They thought it was funny,
Don and Ferman.

1178
01:11:03,960 --> 01:11:06,960
They thought they'd have some sport
with a thick barmaid.

1179
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:09,960
Mind you, she was making
30-bob every visit,

1180
01:11:09,960 --> 01:11:11,960
so who had the last laugh there (?)

1181
01:11:11,960 --> 01:11:14,320
You were ashamed of her?

1182
01:11:14,320 --> 01:11:15,640
No.

1183
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:18,640
I was willing to take her on.

1184
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:20,160
Only you didn't.

1185
01:11:20,160 --> 01:11:22,960
Yeah, she was still with Carl.

1186
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:23,960
Then why didn't she just drop him?

1187
01:11:23,960 --> 01:11:25,960
She was frightened to.

1188
01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:28,960
She was afraid of him.

1189
01:11:29,960 --> 01:11:31,800
And with good reason.

1190
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:35,960
I mean, he got her in the end,
didn't he?

1191
01:11:35,960 --> 01:11:37,960
That what you think?

1192
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:41,960
Don't you?

1193
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:55,960
I didn't tell you, did I?

1194
01:11:55,960 --> 01:11:57,960
The television people
have been in touch.

1195
01:11:59,960 --> 01:12:01,480
Which television people?

1196
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:04,960
About these lecture programmes.

1197
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:06,960
With what happened
to Dr Benford,

1198
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:09,960
they want me to talk to them
about stepping in to her role.

1199
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:12,960
Is that something you want?

1200
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:15,800
To be a...
Oh, what do you call them,

1201
01:12:15,800 --> 01:12:16,960
a television personality?

1202
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:18,320
No. Not really.

1203
01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:19,960
I can't think of anything worse.

1204
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:22,960
But they've asked
and you never know.

1205
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:24,960
Might be good for the department.

1206
01:12:28,960 --> 01:12:33,960
This Dr Benford
that the police were here about.

1207
01:12:33,960 --> 01:12:35,480
Is there any news?

1208
01:12:35,480 --> 01:12:36,960
No.

1209
01:12:37,960 --> 01:12:39,160
No.

1210
01:12:41,480 --> 01:12:43,960
She must have been pretty.

1211
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:46,000
How's that?

1212
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,160
You never mention the pretty ones.

1213
01:12:48,160 --> 01:12:50,960
SCOFFS
What nonsense you do talk.

1214
01:12:50,960 --> 01:12:51,960
I'm plain.

1215
01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:53,960
It must be very dull for you.

1216
01:12:53,960 --> 01:12:56,960
Now, you're just
fishing for compliments.

1217
01:12:56,960 --> 01:12:59,960
If I've not mentioned her,
it's because I barely notice her.

1218
01:12:59,960 --> 01:13:02,960
You know, they are a general
nuisance in the laboratory,

1219
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:04,960
but beyond that,
they are invisible to me.

1220
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:10,800
Dessert?

1221
01:13:11,480 --> 01:13:12,960
Prunes.

1222
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:14,960
Oh, splendid.

1223
01:13:15,960 --> 01:13:17,960
And cold custard.

1224
01:13:17,960 --> 01:13:19,800
Tip-top.

1225
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:02,960
FOOTSTEPS CRUNCH

1226
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:15,960
EERIE WHISTLING

1227
01:14:21,960 --> 01:14:23,480
That Miss Tate telephoned.

1228
01:14:23,480 --> 01:14:25,960
She's had another one of her turns,
and wanted to talk to somebody.

1229
01:14:25,960 --> 01:14:27,960
I'll give her a call.

1230
01:14:27,960 --> 01:14:29,960
I don't know if it's connected,

1231
01:14:29,960 --> 01:14:31,960
but this was handed over
from nights.

1232
01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:34,960
Woman reported a fella
exposing himself to on the towpath.

1233
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:37,960
Not 200 yards from where
Molly Andrews' body was found.

1234
01:14:37,960 --> 01:14:40,960
She says she heard someone whistling
just before he jumped out at her.

1235
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:41,960
I've got identikit coming in,

1236
01:14:41,960 --> 01:14:43,960
see if we can't get
a description off her.

1237
01:14:43,960 --> 01:14:47,640
His face, obviously, not the, er...

1238
01:14:47,640 --> 01:14:49,960
Last turkey in the shop?

1239
01:14:49,960 --> 01:14:52,000
Hanging about the bushes
half the night in all weathers

1240
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,960
on the off-chance of a passer-by
to wave your doings at.

1241
01:14:55,960 --> 01:14:57,160
What do they get out of it?

1242
01:14:57,160 --> 01:14:58,960
That's what I can never fathom.

1243
01:14:58,960 --> 01:15:01,800
Great relief to us all,
Sergeant, I'm sure (!)

1244
01:15:01,800 --> 01:15:04,160
You think that's what's happened
at New Year? He goes out flashing,

1245
01:15:04,160 --> 01:15:06,960
and something's gone wrong
between him and Molly Andrews.

1246
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:09,960
I don't think it's about a man
exposing himself on the towpath.

1247
01:15:09,960 --> 01:15:10,960
I think it's about a college type

1248
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:13,960
writing his telephone number
on flashcards for a barmaid.

1249
01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:16,960
Did Dr Benford ever mention
her private life?

1250
01:15:18,160 --> 01:15:19,960
Not really.

1251
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:23,960
What about a Dr Kreitsek,
did she ever mention him?

1252
01:15:25,960 --> 01:15:28,000
SHE QUIVERS
It was here, wasn't it?

1253
01:15:29,960 --> 01:15:32,960
Where she died.
The girl from New Year.

1254
01:15:36,320 --> 01:15:38,960
When did you start having these,

1255
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:41,800
what would you call them,
intuitions?

1256
01:15:41,800 --> 01:15:43,960
Erm, when I was a little girl.

1257
01:15:43,960 --> 01:15:45,960
It was just little things.

1258
01:15:45,960 --> 01:15:47,960
Family things to start with.

1259
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:49,960
My aunt had a car accident,

1260
01:15:49,960 --> 01:15:51,960
and I knew about it
before she'd told my mum.

1261
01:15:51,960 --> 01:15:53,640
Right.

1262
01:15:56,480 --> 01:15:58,960
Sorry, I don't wanna go down there.

1263
01:16:03,960 --> 01:16:05,960
The man from here,

1264
01:16:05,960 --> 01:16:07,960
could he have anything to do
with what happened to Dr Benford?

1265
01:16:09,960 --> 01:16:11,160
I don't know.

1266
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:14,960
SHE SIGHS
Look, it's like...

1267
01:16:14,960 --> 01:16:18,960
being a radio that's left on,

1268
01:16:18,960 --> 01:16:20,960
that's tuning through
the frequencies,

1269
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:22,960
trying to find a station.

1270
01:16:22,960 --> 01:16:25,960
I can't always make sense
of what I see until later.

1271
01:16:29,320 --> 01:16:30,960
Like with you.

1272
01:16:31,960 --> 01:16:32,960
Me?

1273
01:16:34,320 --> 01:16:35,960
Why, what about me?

1274
01:16:35,960 --> 01:16:37,960
There's a woman...

1275
01:16:39,320 --> 01:16:40,960
..in a green dress.

1276
01:16:43,320 --> 01:16:46,960
And there's just, er... a sadness.

1277
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:49,640
Does that mean anything to you?

1278
01:16:54,960 --> 01:16:58,960
Jenny Tate confided to Dr Benford
about this vision

1279
01:16:58,960 --> 01:17:01,960
or whatever it was,
and she, in turn, notified you.

1280
01:17:01,960 --> 01:17:04,960
I'm curious as to why you didn't
bring this information

1281
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:05,960
to the police?

1282
01:17:05,960 --> 01:17:07,960
I really didn't think
it was my place.

1283
01:17:07,960 --> 01:17:10,960
We only had Miss Tate's word
to go on.

1284
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:12,960
This vision did not take place

1285
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:14,960
under laboratory controlled
conditions.

1286
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:17,960
We'd no way to know
if it was genuine.

1287
01:17:17,960 --> 01:17:19,960
Or she was just
doing it for attention.

1288
01:17:19,960 --> 01:17:22,960
She could have just picked up on
something she read in the papers.

1289
01:17:22,960 --> 01:17:25,960
You know we're not in
the vision business. Not like that.

1290
01:17:25,960 --> 01:17:29,960
Our experiments suggest
that paranormal phenomena,

1291
01:17:29,960 --> 01:17:33,960
present in far less dramatic
a fashion than she described.

1292
01:17:33,960 --> 01:17:37,960
You're not treating her claims with
any degree of seriousness, are you?

1293
01:17:37,960 --> 01:17:39,960
There are certain
details of the crime

1294
01:17:39,960 --> 01:17:42,480
known only to ourselves
and the perpetrator.

1295
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:45,960
Miss Tate's insight or vision,
or whatever you wanna call it,

1296
01:17:45,960 --> 01:17:48,960
accords with those peculiarities
to a degree

1297
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:51,960
which warrants us
taking them very seriously indeed.

1298
01:17:51,960 --> 01:17:53,160
Oh, and what happened to Naomi?

1299
01:17:53,160 --> 01:17:55,960
Did, erm... Miss Tate have
a vision of what happened there?

1300
01:17:55,960 --> 01:17:57,960
Oh, that's a very good point, Dai.

1301
01:17:57,960 --> 01:17:59,640
They were quite close.

1302
01:17:59,640 --> 01:18:02,960
If this girl really had
half the talent she pretends to,

1303
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:05,480
one might imagine
she'd have some idea

1304
01:18:05,480 --> 01:18:07,960
of who was responsible
for Naomi's death.

1305
01:18:07,960 --> 01:18:10,960
If she had, Professor, I'd hardly
be at liberty to discuss it.

1306
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:13,960
Certainly not
with any of her colleagues.

1307
01:18:15,800 --> 01:18:16,960
Hm.

1308
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:19,960
Yeah. Yeah, no.
I'll be right over. Thank you.

1309
01:18:19,960 --> 01:18:21,160
Could you cover for me?

1310
01:18:21,160 --> 01:18:22,960
Why? Where you going?

1311
01:18:24,320 --> 01:18:27,960
Looks like Dr Kreitsek
wasn't lying about Molly Andrews.

1312
01:18:27,960 --> 01:18:28,960
She's here, all right,

1313
01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:30,960
with all the rest
of the guinea-pigs.

1314
01:18:30,960 --> 01:18:33,960
Professor Blish signed off
her expenses each visit.

1315
01:18:33,960 --> 01:18:35,960
Worth giving Carl another go,
I think.

1316
01:18:35,960 --> 01:18:38,960
So, Professor Blish uses
a fountain pen?

1317
01:18:38,960 --> 01:18:41,960
Hm? You can tell by the signature
on the time sheet, look.

1318
01:18:41,960 --> 01:18:43,960
The nib has become splayed.

1319
01:18:43,960 --> 01:18:46,960
That's what's giving it
that double-vision look. So?

1320
01:18:49,960 --> 01:18:53,960
I thought it was unusual
for Dr Benford

1321
01:18:53,960 --> 01:18:55,960
to be using a pen like this.

1322
01:18:55,960 --> 01:18:57,960
This is Professor Blish's pen.

1323
01:18:58,960 --> 01:19:01,960
But we saw Blish sign a cheque
for the butcher's.

1324
01:19:01,960 --> 01:19:04,000
It was a silver pen, quite modern.

1325
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,960
But didn't his wife
give him a pen with the chequebook?

1326
01:19:06,960 --> 01:19:08,960
Bloke can have more than one pen.

1327
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:12,800
He can, but this pen belonged
to Professor Blish.

1328
01:19:13,800 --> 01:19:15,960
Look, the lines on the page,

1329
01:19:15,960 --> 01:19:18,640
are the exact same
as the signature on the timesheets.

1330
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:20,960
And that's the pen that was found
under Dr Benford's body?

1331
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:24,160
Which means it must have landed
before she fell.

1332
01:19:24,160 --> 01:19:26,960
Why kill Molly Andrews, though?

1333
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:28,960
You think he was knocking her off?

1334
01:19:28,960 --> 01:19:30,960
Only one way to find out.

1335
01:19:32,960 --> 01:19:37,960
Just one or two formalities
I wanted to go through with you.

1336
01:19:37,960 --> 01:19:40,960
I'm taking care of Dr Benford's
subjects now.

1337
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:42,960
SHE CLEARS THROAT

1338
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:46,160
You spoke to the police, I believe?

1339
01:19:46,160 --> 01:19:48,960
Er, yes. Yes, I did.

1340
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:50,320
About Dr Benford?

1341
01:19:50,320 --> 01:19:53,960
Yes. And I told her about my...

1342
01:19:53,960 --> 01:19:56,960
Er, what I saw on the towpath.

1343
01:19:56,960 --> 01:20:00,960
And did you talk to them about
anything else? Anyone here, say?

1344
01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:02,960
Like who?

1345
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:07,960
Well...

1346
01:20:09,960 --> 01:20:12,960
..you remember that little
conversation I had with Dr Benford?

1347
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:15,320
You were both laughing.

1348
01:20:15,320 --> 01:20:16,960
Do you remember?

1349
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:18,960
On the staircase.

1350
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:19,960
WOMEN GIGGLE

1351
01:20:19,960 --> 01:20:21,960
Perhaps, I seemed a little funny?

1352
01:20:21,960 --> 01:20:22,960
What's...
'A little cross, maybe?'

1353
01:20:22,960 --> 01:20:25,960
..what's funny?
Oh, nothing.

1354
01:20:25,960 --> 01:20:26,960
Oh, really.

1355
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:28,960
It seemed quite funny.

1356
01:20:28,960 --> 01:20:29,960
No. No, I assure you.

1357
01:20:29,960 --> 01:20:31,960
Do you?

1358
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:34,960
Well, then, I am assured...

1359
01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:36,960
aren't I?

1360
01:20:43,960 --> 01:20:46,320
Did you mention that at all?

1361
01:20:47,960 --> 01:20:50,480
No.

1362
01:20:51,320 --> 01:20:52,960
Well, that's good.

1363
01:20:55,960 --> 01:20:57,320
SHE GASPS AND SPLUTTERS,
HE GRUNTS

1364
01:20:59,800 --> 01:21:01,960
DOOR OPENS,
VOICE CALLS OUT

1365
01:21:04,160 --> 01:21:04,960
You're all right.
You're all right.

1366
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:05,960
You OK?
You're all right.
You're all right.

1367
01:21:05,960 --> 01:21:06,480
You OK?

1368
01:21:15,960 --> 01:21:17,800
So, did Molly Andrews
threaten to expose

1369
01:21:17,800 --> 01:21:19,480
what was going on between you
to your wife?

1370
01:21:19,480 --> 01:21:20,960
Is that why you killed her?

1371
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:21,960
Square.

1372
01:21:21,960 --> 01:21:24,960
She was blackmailing you,
so you strangled her

1373
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:26,960
the way you tried to strangle
Jenny Tate.

1374
01:21:27,960 --> 01:21:29,800
What?

1375
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:31,960
Molly, I, er...

1376
01:21:31,960 --> 01:21:33,960
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1377
01:21:36,160 --> 01:21:37,960
What happened between me and Naomi

1378
01:21:37,960 --> 01:21:39,960
was nothing to do
with anything else.

1379
01:21:39,960 --> 01:21:41,960
No more lies, Professor.

1380
01:21:41,960 --> 01:21:43,960
You'll never breathe free air again.

1381
01:21:43,960 --> 01:21:46,960
Why don't you come clean?
Get it off your chest.

1382
01:21:46,960 --> 01:21:49,960
You must have hated her
with a passion.

1383
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:52,160
Hate Naomi?

1384
01:21:52,160 --> 01:21:54,960
I didn't hate her.

1385
01:21:54,960 --> 01:21:56,960
Quite the opposite.

1386
01:21:57,960 --> 01:21:59,640
I had feelings for her.

1387
01:22:01,960 --> 01:22:03,960
And she gave me reason to believe
they were reciprocated.

1388
01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:07,960
You know, it's...
it's little things.

1389
01:22:08,960 --> 01:22:11,960
Shy glances held a moment too long.

1390
01:22:13,320 --> 01:22:15,960
Young woman like that?

1391
01:22:15,960 --> 01:22:17,960
What would she want
with an old stick like you?

1392
01:22:17,960 --> 01:22:21,960
No, you don't know.
You've no conception.

1393
01:22:21,960 --> 01:22:27,640
An older man has experience, wisdom.

1394
01:22:28,960 --> 01:22:30,960
Donald, I'm-I'm flattered, but...

1395
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:33,960
I thought...

1396
01:22:35,960 --> 01:22:39,960
You gave me reason to believe
you felt something for me.

1397
01:22:41,480 --> 01:22:43,960
I... I gave you no reason.

1398
01:22:45,640 --> 01:22:46,960
You took my arm.

1399
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:49,960
What?

1400
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:52,640
In the common room.

1401
01:22:53,960 --> 01:22:55,000
Did I?

1402
01:22:58,960 --> 01:22:59,960
HE SIGHS

1403
01:23:00,960 --> 01:23:02,960
I suppose you'll
put it round the college now.

1404
01:23:02,960 --> 01:23:04,160
You can all have a...

1405
01:23:04,160 --> 01:23:06,960
you can all have
a jolly good laugh. Well...

1406
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:09,960
I'm telling you now,
I won't be laughed at! I won't.

1407
01:23:09,960 --> 01:23:12,480
I know. I wouldn't.

1408
01:23:12,480 --> 01:23:14,800
I respect you too much
to ever laugh.

1409
01:23:15,800 --> 01:23:17,960
She had a lovely laugh.

1410
01:23:17,960 --> 01:23:19,960
That's one of the things
that first drew me to her.

1411
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:25,960
But, I mean, when you think
about it. It was her fault.

1412
01:23:28,960 --> 01:23:30,960
That's what set the whole thing
in motion. The end of it.

1413
01:23:39,960 --> 01:23:41,960
Donald?

1414
01:23:41,960 --> 01:23:43,960
HE SCOFFS
I gave you a chance!

1415
01:23:43,960 --> 01:23:45,800
Here.

1416
01:23:45,800 --> 01:23:46,960
To make something of yourself.

1417
01:23:46,960 --> 01:23:50,000
I give you a chance and...
you used me.

1418
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:51,960
Used you how?

1419
01:23:51,960 --> 01:23:55,960
I am infinitely more qualified
for that television thing than you.

1420
01:23:55,960 --> 01:23:58,480
It was me first mentioned
your name to them.

1421
01:23:58,480 --> 01:23:59,960
I thought you might make
a good assistant.

1422
01:23:59,960 --> 01:24:01,960
That's what this is about?

1423
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:05,960
Your bruised ego.

1424
01:24:05,960 --> 01:24:08,640
A woman beat you to the job,
and you can't stand it.

1425
01:24:10,960 --> 01:24:11,960
You're pathetic.

1426
01:24:12,960 --> 01:24:13,960
Where do you think you're going?!

1427
01:24:15,960 --> 01:24:17,000
I'm going home, Donald.

1428
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,320
You'll stay here
until I'm finished with you!

1429
01:24:19,320 --> 01:24:21,960
I just want a kiss. Kiss me.

1430
01:24:21,960 --> 01:24:23,960
What are you doing? Get off me!

1431
01:24:23,960 --> 01:24:25,960
I would have changed my life,

1432
01:24:25,960 --> 01:24:26,960
burnt all this to the ground.

1433
01:24:26,960 --> 01:24:28,960
Please. Please. Please.

1434
01:24:28,960 --> 01:24:30,960
SHE SCREAMS,
HE GASPS

1435
01:24:35,960 --> 01:24:37,960
She could have been something,
you know?

1436
01:24:41,480 --> 01:24:43,960
Really been something.

1437
01:24:43,960 --> 01:24:46,960
She was more than "something",
she was someone.

1438
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:48,960
Is that how it went
with Molly Andrews?

1439
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:50,480
You became fixated with her

1440
01:24:50,480 --> 01:24:52,960
the same way you became
fixated on Dr Benford?

1441
01:24:52,960 --> 01:24:55,640
Did she reject your unwanted
advances in the same way?

1442
01:24:55,640 --> 01:24:56,960
Is that why you killed her?

1443
01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:07,960
I'm off.

1444
01:25:07,960 --> 01:25:09,480
Drink?

1445
01:25:09,480 --> 01:25:12,960
Erm... I won't this evening.

1446
01:25:17,960 --> 01:25:18,960
You were right, then.

1447
01:25:20,960 --> 01:25:21,960
And I was wrong.

1448
01:25:22,960 --> 01:25:24,960
It wasn't the boyfriend.

1449
01:25:25,960 --> 01:25:26,960
MORSE EXHALES

1450
01:25:26,960 --> 01:25:29,000
Well, don't feel too bad about it.

1451
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:32,960
Sometimes you can't see
what's staring you in the face.

1452
01:25:32,960 --> 01:25:34,960
We got there in the end.

1453
01:25:34,960 --> 01:25:36,000
That's the main thing.

1454
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:38,960
See you tomorrow.

1455
01:25:45,800 --> 01:25:46,960
CHATTER

1456
01:25:50,960 --> 01:25:51,960
You made it!
MORSE LAUGHS

1457
01:25:51,960 --> 01:25:53,960
How's the case.
Did you get your man?

1458
01:25:53,960 --> 01:25:54,960
Yeah, it looks that way.

1459
01:25:54,960 --> 01:25:56,960
Congratulations.

1460
01:25:56,960 --> 01:25:59,640
Hmm. Thank you.
I say, this is quite the place.

1461
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:02,960
Let me get you a top up.

1462
01:26:02,960 --> 01:26:04,960
Sure.
Well, make yourself at home.

1463
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:05,960
Enjoy the garden. Relax.

1464
01:26:05,960 --> 01:26:07,960
I'll find you and you can
tell me all about it.

1465
01:26:17,960 --> 01:26:21,960
My wife's been having
these people round.

1466
01:26:21,960 --> 01:26:24,320
Faith healers,
they call themselves.

1467
01:26:24,320 --> 01:26:28,960
They perform this laying on
of hands, they call it.

1468
01:26:28,960 --> 01:26:30,960
Touching her body
while prayers are said.

1469
01:26:31,960 --> 01:26:36,320
She says it won't work unless...
one believes.

1470
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:39,960
Do you believe?

1471
01:26:41,160 --> 01:26:43,960
Well, can't say I've ever had much
use for it in civilian life

1472
01:26:43,960 --> 01:26:45,960
outside of court, of course.

1473
01:26:45,960 --> 01:26:47,960
We weren't Bible raised.

1474
01:26:48,960 --> 01:26:50,960
Can it work, do you think?

1475
01:26:52,960 --> 01:26:54,000
Beyond me, sir.

1476
01:26:55,960 --> 01:26:59,960
For some people,
believing's enough.

1477
01:26:59,960 --> 01:27:03,320
What they say,
"Faith can move mountains"?

1478
01:27:04,640 --> 01:27:05,960
If it gives her comfort.

1479
01:27:05,960 --> 01:27:07,160
Yes. Yes, that's...

1480
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:10,960
..that's the important thing.
Comfort. Hope.

1481
01:27:13,960 --> 01:27:15,960
But I worry, do you see?

1482
01:27:15,960 --> 01:27:20,960
What if there is a chance
it can work and my want of faith...?

1483
01:27:57,960 --> 01:27:58,960
Morse!

1484
01:27:58,960 --> 01:28:00,960
Come and meet my wife.
