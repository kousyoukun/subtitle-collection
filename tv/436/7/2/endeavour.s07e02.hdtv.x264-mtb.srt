to bring you

MEGAPHONE: For a better Oxford,

this Thursday, 18th June,
vote Conservative

12
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,280
because a vote
for the Conservative Party

13
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:37,110

00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:00,280
And all the way from Africa...

18
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,160
it's Johnny Simba!

CHEERING

20
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,720
How is she, Doctor?

21
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,760
Perhaps better
than one might expect.

22
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:34,360
There will be good days.

23
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,640
It's no accident that I use
the word "invasion" advisedly.

24
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,320
Because it contains
the word "Asian".

LAUGHTER

26
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:46,160
Since the war,
we have been literally swamped

27
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,880
with a tidal wave of people

28
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,720
from our former territories
and colonies.

29
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,960
But we left!
We gave them their countries back!

30
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,640
If the British Movement
is about one thing,

31
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,600
it's about British jobs
for British workers.

32
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,040

And British hospitals
for British patients.

00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,880
ALL: Yes!
CLAPPING

36
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,960
It's not the colour of your
passport that makes you British.

37
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,000
- It's the colour of your skin.
- Yes.

- Is he home?
- No. No, he's not. He's at school.

What do you want him for?

Like to look at his room,
if you don't mind?

133
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,320
I do mind.
You wanna poke about in my house,

134
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,080
you'll want a warrant, won't you?

135
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:10,680

you know what you can do.

00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,360

I'm sure
Her Majesty's very grateful, sir.

144
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,280
We've got a question
about one of your supporters.

145
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:36,440
Young man called Gary Radowicz.
Also calls himself Rogers.

146
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,960
Doesn't ring a bell.

147
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,160
He was at the talk that
you gave on Monday night.

148
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,910
Was he? Mm.
I really couldn't say.

149
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,480
I don't know
each and every one of those

150
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,240
sympathetic to the cause,
you understand.

151
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,600
There was a lot of people there.

152
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,240
A lot of people are very concerned
about the state of our country.

153
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,520
Well, we're very concerned
about young Pakistani lads

154
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,940
getting knifed on the street.

155
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,640
Terrible.

156
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:59,840
But...
I can't say that I'm surprised.

157
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:03,080
You cram all of these
incompatible cultures together

158

on one small island,

159
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,160
of course it's gonna lead to blood,
and worse.

160
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:09,040
Sounds like a threat, Mr Gorman.

161
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,560
It's just an observation.

162
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,760
If the police
can't keep the streets safe

163
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:16,960
and defend the indigenous population
against outsiders, well...

164
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:19,800
...no wonder people take it
into their own hands.

165
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:23,800
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I've got a seat to win.

166
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,640
Ah, Thursday.

167
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:33,010
- Morning, sir.
- Morse. Sir.

168
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,720
Division have been asking about
this Jakobsson case,

169
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,680
the cook at the working men's club.

170
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:41,280
We've got two women
who've positively identified him

171
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,560
as the man who's been exposing
himself along the river.

172
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,920
- But beyond that... - Random attacks,
as far as we can make out.

173
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,760
Robbery doesn't appear
to have been a motive.

174
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,000
- What about last night's stabbing?
- We've got a name.

175
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,960
Juvenile. 15 years old.
Gerwazy Radowicz.

176
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,600
What's that? Polish, is it?

177
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,280
On his father's side.
AKA, Gary Rogers.

178
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:00,320
- He runs with this racialist crowd.
- You're bringing him in, presumably.

179
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,320
If we can find him.
At school, according to his mother.

180
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,200
Though, if he was involved
last night,

181
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,400
I'd be surprised
if he turned up for assembly,

182
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,440
but we'll take a look.

183
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,800
I see, well, keep me apprised
of any developments.

184
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,040
The last thing we need is a public
order issue in Election Week.

185
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,120
Sorry to interrupt, sir.

186
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,120
Couldn't do us a favour,
could you, matey?

187
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,640
- I've got court in an hour.
- What's this? More about last night?

188
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,840
No, sir. Something else.

189
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,800
Missing person,
according to Uniform.

190
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,320
I see. Very well. Carry on.

191
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,300
I'll take the school,
if you want to... Sir.

192
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,760
- Good afternoon, Mrs...?
- Her name is Aziz.

193
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,960
She doesn't speak English.
That's why I'm here.

194
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,560
Mrs Sardar. Nuha Sardar.

195
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,000
Detective Sergeant Morse.

196
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,280
A missing persons case,
my colleague said.

197
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:47,280
Mrs Aziz's husband. He delivers food
for my father-in-law's restaurant.

198
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,400
The Jolly Rajah?

199
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,640
He left the restaurant
just after 11 last night

200
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,920
with his final delivery run,
and never came home.

201
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,120
And how had he been lately?
Anything worrying him?

202
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,040
- She said he'd not been himself.
- In what way?

203
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:03,290
He had something on his mind,
but couldn't tell her what it was?

204
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,360
So this is
his final list of deliveries?

205
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,560
- Yes.
- Just four addresses?

206
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,800
That's right.

207
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:12,320
Nobody called to say their
take-away hadn't been delivered?

208
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,960
- No.
- Right.

209
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:19,760
- Has Mr Aziz been with you long?
- A couple of years.

210
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,960
- Was he a reliable driver?
- Usually.

211
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,400
His wife said he seemed
to have something on his mind.

212
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:29,320
I wondered, is there anything
that had been troubling him at work?

213
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,840
No.

214
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,600
I mean, he did say that
he might wish to speak with me,

215
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,640
but I'm afraid I just put him off.

216
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,440
Any idea
what that might've been about?

217
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,960
Money.

218
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,960
See, his mother-in-law's coming
to live with him later this month.

219
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:47,520
And I suppose he thought
he might get a raise out of me.

220
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,840
Hm.

221
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,320
Can I ask who's responsible
for taking these orders?

222
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,740
Would you like to see a menu?

223
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,280
Perhaps a drink
while you're waiting?

224
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,400
Oh, all right. All right.

225
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:01,120
THEY SPEAK IN INDIAN LANGUAGE

226
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,920
I'm sorry, my brother is, er...

227
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:09,000
is not quite as in command
of his faculties as we're used to.

228
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,340
He's overworked.

229
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,920
Ah, I see, I was just...

230
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,920
...trying to find out
how the orders were dispatched.

231
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:22,760
- How the route is arrived at?
- Oh, right, I see. Um, well...

232
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:27,600
The orders are all bundled together
and sent out hourly, more or less.

233
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,640
Right... But I mean,
the nearest first, presumably?

234
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,640
I believe so.

235
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,320
This is all organised
by my brother and Mr Aziz.

236
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,990
I just take care of the kitchen.

237
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,480
MORSE: Good afternoon, sir.

238
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:45,810
Did you order an Indian takeaway
yesterday evening?

239
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,760
Good afternoon. Detective Sergeant
Morse, Thames Valley.

240
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:53,260
You ordered a takeaway
from The Jolly Rajah last night?

241
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,520
Hello?
DOOR CREAKS

242
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,640
Hello? The police...

243
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,840
Hello?

244
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,560
Doctor. What have we got?

245
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,760
The cause of death
would appear to be a cleaver blow

246
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,560
to the back of the skull.

247
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,320
No defensive wounds.

248
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,360
Blood splatter on the wall,

249
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:34,160
and what looks to be
a print on the door frame.

250
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,750
That be the weapon?

251
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,760
I can't say exactly

252
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,440
until I see
what comes back from the lab.

253
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,680
That's the bloke
who delivered my curry last night.

254
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:48,480
- About what time?
- Um... around 11?

255
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,840
Whose place is this?

256
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:52,960
It's a man called, erm,
Oberon Prince.

257
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
He's a cook,
according to the porter.

258
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,720
Yeah. He's off the telly.

259
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,680
He's got
a recipes and reviews column

260
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,320
in the Oxford Mail every Saturday.

261
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,720
So where is he?

262
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,600
Just a few questions.

263
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,760
Do you know Mr Prince in number ten?

264
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:09,640
We've said "hello" once or twice.
He's friendly enough.

265
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,960
- Have you lived here long?
- 18 months.

266
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:14,520
It's my dad's place. One of 'em.

267
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,040
I'm going through a divorce.

268
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,880
He doesn't use it much, so I...

269
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:21,240
So you didn't see or hear
anything unusual last night?

270
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,240
No.

271
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:25,370
Well, thank you very much,
Miss Trent.

272
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,320
Oberon Prince.

273
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,160
I've only met him a couple of times.

274
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,360
He files his copy by post,

275
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:35,000
always well in advance
of his deadline.

276
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,600
Turns up at the Christmas party
once in a while.

277
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,640
Family?

278
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:41,880
Has a wife, I think. Or had been.

279
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:45,080
Rosemary, possibly.
One of the herbs.

280
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,920
And this is the only address
you have for him?

281
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,280
Far as I know.

282
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,280
There might be a holiday home
in Greece.

283
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,440
I can look into it for you.
Can I get a quote?

284
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:57,160
All right,
we're keeping an open mind.

285
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,560
We welcome
the chance to speak to him

286
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:02,360
and urge him to contact us
at the earliest opportunity.

287
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:06,560
Well, I've an inquest to attend
once I'm done here,

288
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,880
but I'll see
it makes the late edition.

289
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,200
- Anyone we know?
- Farmer out towards Wytham.

290
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,360
Drowned in the pigswill.

291
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,840
You know,
this is the sixth freak accident

292
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:19,240
I've attended in as many months.

293
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:22,800
All relatively healthy.
All in their 30s or 40s. All single.

294
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,520
- Hm?
- Half a dozen in half a year?

295
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:27,360
Hardly what you'd call an epidemic.

296
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,860
Well, you know best, I'm sure.

297
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,960
See you later.
CAR DOOR CLOSES

298
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:46,120
Sir. The food for the third delivery
on his list is still in his car.

299
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,680
- How's that?
- It's, er, 14 Mendip Gardens West.

300
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:52,240
Nah, there's a Mendip Gardens North
and a Mendip Gardens South,

301
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,040
but no West.
Nor East, for that matter.

302
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:56,000
Could the restaurant
have taken it down wrong?

303
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,080
Well, it's possible.

304
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:00,120
The proprietor's
an, erm, Uqbah Sardar.

305
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,880
According to his brother, he's been
a little off his game recently.

306
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,120
You'd have thought
if someone's supper didn't turn up,

307
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,600
they might've rung to complain.

308
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,840
Yeah, that's what I thought,
but apparently not.

309
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,080
I'd better report back
to Mr Bright.

310
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,560
Can you and Jim finish up here?

311
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,080
Get out a ports and airports,

312
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,840
and see that Prince's photograph
is circulated.

313
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:19,280
Oh, erm, sir,
Miss Frazil's freak accidents,

314
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,040
you don't think
there's anything in that?

315
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:23,320
Besides a few thousand
on the circulation?

316
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:25,990
You know what the press is like.

317
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:31,160
Porter'd clocked
Aziz's car this morning.

318
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,600
He keeps
a list of those cars he sees

319
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,160
that don't have
a right to park here,

320
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,000
as some of the residents
can get quite beady.

321
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,200
And what did he say about him,
Prince?

322
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:41,360
Lived here about six years.
No trouble.

323
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,280
Last saw him yesterday morning
when he took him up his post.

324
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,700
Very popular with the ladies.

325
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:52,520
So, Prince orders a take-away
and then kills the delivery driver?

326
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:56,000
Or maybe he was on a promise
last night and never came home?

327
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,200
Mr Aziz was just in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

328
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,400
Perhaps he stumbled upon
a burglary or something?

329
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,000
Anything's possible, matey.

RADIO: ..death of an employee

331
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,800
of a popular Oxford restaurant,
The Jolly Rajah.

332
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,440
The victim,
who is yet to be identified,

333
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,640
is believed to be
a driver at the restaurant.

334
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,040
A stabbing last night, and now this.

335
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:16,160
- Connected, do you think?
- Nothing to say so, sir.

336
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,360
Both victims are Pakistani,
aren't they?

337
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,160
Yes, sir.
But that's as far as it goes.

338
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,480
Well, that's far enough.

339
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:24,280
Division will be monitoring
this situation very carefully.

340
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:26,720
Was the victim
known to this Prince character?

341
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,320
Not as we've been able
to establish yet, sir.

342
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:31,520
Morse and me are gonna brace 'em
down the restaurant,

343
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,880
see if there's anything there.

344
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:33,920
He orders an Indian meal,

345
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,680
and then butchers the man
who delivers it?

346
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,360
What is he? A lunatic of some sort?

347
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,920
Food critic, sir.

348
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,680
Even so.

349
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:44,560
Taking an axe to someone's head
goes beyond expressing

350
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,880
dissatisfaction with the service,
wouldn't you say?

351
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,800
He's had some sort of
emotional breakdown, maybe?

352
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,920
If it was him.

353
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:53,560
Well, if it wasn't,
you'd imagine he'd come forward

354
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:57,800
as soon as he hears his flat's
been turned into a slaughterhouse.

DOOR KNOCK

00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:29,760
Good afternoon, Mrs Sardar.
Might we come in?

366
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,080
Yes, of course.

367
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,560
It's the police. About Mr Aziz.

368
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,520
Detective Chief Inspector Thursday,
Thames Valley.

369
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,960
I believe you met my colleague.

370
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:49,440
Yes. Yes, of course.
My nephews, Dr Farook Sardar

371
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,080
and his young brother, Salim.

372
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:53,080
- You found him?
- We did, sir.

373
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:56,800
And I'm sorry to say
it's not good news, he's deceased.

374
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:59,300
And it wasn't a natural death.

375
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,190
What? Another attack?

376
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,440
Well, we can't speculate
at this stage, sir.

377
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,280
His car was found
outside a block of flats

378
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:12,200
called Tiffin Court.
Do you know it?

379
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,200
- No.
- I've never heard of it.

380
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,080
Did Mr Aziz have any enemies,
as far as you know?

381
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,640
No, he was... mildest of men.

382
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:23,320
No trouble with any
of the customers, nothing like that?

383
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:25,320
No, he saw nothing of the customers,

384
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:28,200
only walking through the restaurant
from the kitchen

385
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,400
to do his deliveries.

386
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,160
And we need to speak
to your brother, sir.

387
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,200
Uqbah, is it?

388
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,400
Er, about a couple of orders
he took.

389
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,880
The addresses appear
to have been taken down wrongly.

390
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,520
I'm afraid my father's not well,
Chief Inspector.

391
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,000
Recently, he's been...
having trouble with his memory,

392
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,400
- his reading and writing skills.
- Well, how's that?

393
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,160
Well...
For a few months,

394
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,720
there's been, ah...
discrepancies when cashing up.

395
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,720
He's been charging people twice over
for dishes on their bill,

396
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:54,000
or... not ringing it up at all.

397
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,800
How long as he been like this?

398
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:58,640
It has got worse over the last year.

399
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,640
We've been trying to talk to him
about doing less,

400
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,520
retiring, even,
but... he won't hear of it.

401
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,200
It would be helpful if
we could see a list of the customers

402
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,800
- that did come in last night.
- Certainly.

403
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,960
All the information's at The Rajah.

404
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:14,630
Ah, er, when you're ready,
we might go to the restaurant.

405
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,040
Did you have many bookings?

406
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:19,720
I suppose three-quarters
of the cover's early in the evening.

407
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,760
Was there any trouble
between Mr Aziz

408
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,280
and any of the other customers?

409
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,120
No. There was quite a rowdy table,
but...

410
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:29,480
they had nothing to do with Mr Aziz.
Wrestlers, I think.

411
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,800
- Had they booked?
- No, but they've been in before.

412
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:32,840
Always late.

413
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,720
What time did you close up
last night?

414
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,640
I closed the kitchen at 11.

415
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,480
My brother had a bit of a turn.

416
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,080
So we called Farook
and he took him home.

417
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,720
And then Salim followed on
in his car,

418
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,720
and I... shut up the restaurant
at, er, just after 12.

419
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,720
So you were alone?
Would that be usual?

420
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:54,280
Oh! First in, last out. Chef's lot.

421
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:57,280
Ah, the counterfoils,
for the credit card and the cheques.

422
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:59,520
Which were the addresses
you were having trouble with?

423
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:03,920
Tiffin Court, it was 10, not 1C.
And, er, Mendip Gardens West.

424
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:07,080
Maybe my brother
wrote it down wrongly.

425
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:10,160
Well...
thank you for your assistance.

426
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,520
We'll return these
as soon as possible.

427
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:14,190
TOGETHER: Thank you.

428
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:28,440
MORSE: I won't be long.

429
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,050
OFFICER: Sir.

430
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,960
- I'm sorry, who are you?
- I'm his wife.

431
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,440
Well, his first wife.

432
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,560
Rosemary Prince.

433
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,200
I believe
you're looking for my husband.

434
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,400
So I'm sorry,
what is it you're doing here?

435
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,240
Well, I was concerned.

436
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:21,800
I hoped he might have turned up,
come back,

437
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,200
then all this could be explained.

438
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,120
And when did you see him last,
Mr Prince?

439
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:28,160
I haven't seen him for a while.

440
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:31,920
But we speak... on the telephone,
every week.

441
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,550
Do you mind if I...

442
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,760
I know it's a little early,
but to steady my nerves.

443
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:39,760
Have you any idea where he might be?
There's talk of a place in Greece.

444
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:42,320
And a suitcase of his
appears to be missing.

445
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:45,570
Well, he does have a little place
there.

446
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,640
Well, who was he?

447
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,960
He was a delivery man...

448
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,280
from a restaurant
called The Jolly Rajah.

449
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:56,280
Did he ever mentioned
a man called Aziz? Iqbal Aziz?

450
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,800
No. Never.

451
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,280
Does that seem in keeping to you?

452
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,120
That he would order food
to be delivered.

453
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,280
Indian, certainly.

454
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,160
We never touched it
on the programme.

455
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:07,760
- Sorry, the programme?
- "Et Voila".

456
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,440
We started together.
On the television.

457
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,120
It was my Johnny to his Fanny.

458
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:14,960
Oh, it was 15 years ago, nigh on.

459
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,760
The Dark Ages.

460
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:20,200
Most people had barely heard
of vinaigrette, huh!

461
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,760
Look...

462
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:25,640
whatever you think he's done,
you're quite wrong.

463
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:29,280
Only he has his faults,
but this is far beyond his scope.

464
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:31,200
It's way too grotesque.

465
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,560
If you don't mind me asking,
what happened between you?

466
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,230
Oh, it was my fault.

467
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:40,720
I never cared for
the sticky side of married life.

468
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:44,240
We looked at other couples,
they might've had the physical side,

469
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,920
but most of them could barely stand
the sight of each other

470
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,120
half the time.

471
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:51,440
We had something
they could only dream of...

472
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,440
companionship.

473
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:56,400
And he was the most tremendous fun.

474
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Right up until
the sixth whisky sour.

475
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:02,680
Then things could turn
a little... ugly.

476
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,180
So what, he drank?

477
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:08,840
He drank. He gambled.
But I never stopped loving him.

478
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,510
Was he ever violent?

479
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:13,560
On occasion.

480
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:18,850
But I don't believe he's capable
of anything that happened here.

481
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:22,520
I can't. It's not the best time.

482
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:24,120
I can't talk now.

483
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,040
I agree, there's a lot to discuss.

484
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,700
I can't help you.

485
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,960
Sorry.

486
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,090
Who was that?

487
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,040
Wrong number.

488
00:28:02,410 --> 00:28:06,410
You don't think
we could've got it wrong, do you?

489
00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:08,610
I know, but...

490
00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:09,820
two murders...

491
00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:15,890
...Molly Andrews, Tony Jakobsson...
on the same stretch of Tow path?

492
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:17,610
For fear of
sounding like a broken record,

493
00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:20,370
I think
a man getting his throat cut,

494
00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:24,250
is a world apart
from a woman having her neck broken.

495
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:27,850
We've got who killed
Molly Andrews and Naomi Bedford,

496
00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:29,410
he's on remand in Farley.

497
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:31,090
Unless you wanted to drop
all charges

498
00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:34,090
and have him back out on the street.

499
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:39,130
How'd you make out at Prince's flat?

500
00:28:39,130 --> 00:28:41,290
Met his wife. Well, his first wife.

501
00:28:41,290 --> 00:28:43,490
Still seems to carry
something of a torch for him.

502
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:44,970
- What was she doing there?
- Same as us,

503
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:46,250
wants to know where Prince is.

504
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:47,970
- Shed any light?
- No.

505
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:49,890
But I did turn this up.

506
00:28:53,890 --> 00:28:55,490
- Gambler.
- Mm.

507
00:28:55,530 --> 00:28:59,530
Something of a drinker, too,
and violent with it.

508
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:01,850
Nothing from Ports and Airports

509
00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:03,610
on flight manifests
or passenger lists.

510
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:06,130
If he's already gone,
he's done it under a different name.

511
00:29:06,130 --> 00:29:08,610
But he's from the television,
isn't he?

512
00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:10,570
Be difficult for someone like that

513
00:29:10,570 --> 00:29:12,890
to slip out of the country
unnoticed, I'd have thought.

514
00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:14,530
Unless he's changed his appearance?

515
00:29:14,530 --> 00:29:16,970
Anything from Forensics
on the bloody thumb print

516
00:29:16,970 --> 00:29:18,130
found at Tiffin Court?

517
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:19,570
No match for Oberon Prince.

518
00:29:19,570 --> 00:29:22,050
What about the Greek Inn,
that place he's got out there?

519
00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:23,570
Vrakonisi?

520
00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:27,290
Locals have been up to the villa,
but no sign of life.

521
00:29:27,290 --> 00:29:30,460
- You, ah, seen the latest?
- Oh, yeah.

522
00:29:33,810 --> 00:29:35,980
Still think it wasn't him?

523
00:29:55,650 --> 00:29:57,450
SHE SOBS

524
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:07,410
OPERA MUSIC PLAYS

525
00:30:10,970 --> 00:30:13,410
DOOR BUZZES

526
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:24,210
Morse, it's been too long!

527
00:30:24,210 --> 00:30:26,210
I've been wandering
the Mediterranean

528
00:30:26,210 --> 00:30:28,130
with my, how do you say it,
"My cap in my hand"?

529
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:30,050
My beggar's bowl.

530
00:30:30,090 --> 00:30:33,450
- Begging bowl.
- All in a good cause, I assure you.

531
00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:36,650
Seeking donations for
my family's charitable foundation.

532
00:30:36,650 --> 00:30:39,370
The only relief I got
was that Steve was there,

533
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:41,690
- making a picture.
- Steve who?

534
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:43,850
McQueen. Yes, it's funny.

535
00:30:43,890 --> 00:30:46,250
The only real person, out of
any of them, should be an actor.

536
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:48,970
But I have been
unforgivably neglectful,

537
00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:51,330
and that's why I'm here.

538
00:30:51,370 --> 00:30:53,650
To rectify matters
and deserve your forgiveness.

539
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:55,890
- There's nothing needs forgiving.
- You're very kind.

540
00:30:55,890 --> 00:30:57,890
But one should keep
the friendships that matter

541
00:30:57,890 --> 00:30:59,210
in good repair, don't you think?

542
00:30:59,210 --> 00:31:00,490
I've never...

543
00:31:00,530 --> 00:31:03,650
I've never really thought about it
that way.

544
00:31:03,650 --> 00:31:07,650
I left messages at your work
before we went away.

545
00:31:07,850 --> 00:31:09,170
Come for supper tomorrow.

546
00:31:09,170 --> 00:31:12,010
Violetta has forsaken me once again.

547
00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:14,350
I'm in need of good company.

548
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:19,770
- Well, I can't promise that.
- Well, you sell yourself too short.

549
00:31:19,770 --> 00:31:21,610
Now, a drink, I think.

550
00:31:21,650 --> 00:31:23,610
I took the liberty.

551
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:25,650
What is this we're listening to?

552
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:28,090
La Cura Per L'Amore. Tregola.

553
00:31:28,130 --> 00:31:31,650
Ah! Well, in that case,
"Due bicchieri".

554
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:38,690
The police have gone.

555
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:41,320
There's nobody here... only me.

556
00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:44,930
I miss you.

557
00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:49,960
Why don't you come round
and keep me company?

558
00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:35,490
WHISTLING

559
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:12,770
Miss! Bridget, isn't it?

560
00:33:12,810 --> 00:33:14,530
Come, come out of the rain.

561
00:33:14,530 --> 00:33:16,450
THUNDER RUMBLES

562
00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:20,970
You wanna be careful
walking along at night like this.

563
00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:24,390
- It's not safe.
- I don't have far to go.

564
00:33:24,690 --> 00:33:29,110
Takes me back to my days
on the beat. Well, on Nights.

565
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:33,670
I used to like Nights.
Especially after a bit of rain.

566
00:33:34,210 --> 00:33:36,610
Oh, Win told me
all about the wrestling.

567
00:33:36,610 --> 00:33:38,930
Yeah! We had a great time.

568
00:33:38,970 --> 00:33:42,250
Oh, I'm all right from here,
Mr Thursday.

569
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:45,590
Oh, all right, then.
You mind how you go.

570
00:33:53,090 --> 00:33:55,370
WHISTLING

571
00:34:16,890 --> 00:34:20,050
Oh... you were in India,
Mrs Bright said.

572
00:34:20,050 --> 00:34:22,890
Yes, yes. Before the war. Hm, yes.

573
00:34:22,930 --> 00:34:24,930
- Whereabouts?
- Oh, here and there.

574
00:34:24,930 --> 00:34:28,170
Calcutta, Pankot, Chandrapore.

575
00:34:28,210 --> 00:34:31,460
- And yourself?
- Oxford, born and bred.

576
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:33,890
Yes, well...

577
00:34:35,130 --> 00:34:37,090
...I was very sad to go.

578
00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:38,450
We both were.

579
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:42,960
- Goodnight, sir.
- Ah, goodnight.

580
00:34:52,930 --> 00:34:56,490
Oh... He's very handsome,
don't you think?

581
00:34:56,530 --> 00:34:59,280
Oh, yes. Very handsome, I'm sure.

582
00:35:01,730 --> 00:35:04,170
Are you jealous, Puli?

583
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:10,170
Desperately.

584
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:17,650
- He says I'm doing much better.
- Good.

585
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:21,610
See, I told you.

586
00:35:23,010 --> 00:35:25,410
You have to have... faith.

587
00:35:31,010 --> 00:35:33,210
OLD MAN MUMBLING

588
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:39,970
What's he doing?

589
00:35:43,730 --> 00:35:45,150
Looking for Ammi.

590
00:35:46,850 --> 00:35:47,940
Sleepwalking.

591
00:35:48,930 --> 00:35:50,090
I don't know.

592
00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:53,550
I thought
Farook could give him something.

593
00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:04,390
You were late tonight,
from the restaurant.

594
00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:06,370
Stock take.

595
00:36:18,970 --> 00:36:21,210
OLD MAN GRUNTS

596
00:36:27,730 --> 00:36:30,530
HE MUTTERS
IN INDIAN LANGUAGE

597
00:36:57,410 --> 00:36:59,970
- And when did you see him last?
- When he went to bed.

598
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:03,490
- What time was that?
- About ten o'clock.

599
00:37:03,530 --> 00:37:05,810
We heard him walking about
afterwards.

600
00:37:05,810 --> 00:37:07,410
And how did he seem?

601
00:37:07,410 --> 00:37:11,610
He had been very anxious.
About what happened to Mr Aziz.

602
00:37:11,610 --> 00:37:14,250
What happened? You were
meant to be looking after him.

603
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:17,650
- I've told him.
- You don't tell me anything.

604
00:37:17,650 --> 00:37:20,130
We will get a description
circulated to all patrol cars

605
00:37:20,130 --> 00:37:21,610
and beat officers.

606
00:37:21,610 --> 00:37:23,570
Try not to worry.

607
00:37:23,610 --> 00:37:26,330
What about
the Oberon Prince case, Morse?

608
00:37:26,330 --> 00:37:29,570
- Anything on the ports and airports?
- Nothing, sir.

609
00:37:29,570 --> 00:37:30,650
Sir...

610
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:35,570
- He was at the restaurant that night.
- Which restaurant?

611
00:37:35,570 --> 00:37:37,490
- Jolly Rajah.
- Who was? Prince?

612
00:37:37,490 --> 00:37:39,250
Well, that can't be right.

613
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:42,010
Moniker here on his credit card slip
says different, matey.

614
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:43,810
But if he'd already eaten
at the restaurant,

615
00:37:43,810 --> 00:37:46,310
why would he order a takeaway?

616
00:37:47,050 --> 00:37:49,930
Oh, yes. Yes, he was here.

617
00:37:49,970 --> 00:37:54,290
In fact, he had words with that
rowdy table I was telling you about.

618
00:37:54,290 --> 00:37:57,460
- Party of eight.
- Mr Nayle, was that?

619
00:37:58,090 --> 00:38:00,590
Yeah, that sounds about right.

620
00:38:09,490 --> 00:38:12,890
- MORSE: Still no sign of Gary.
- And Prince?

621
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:16,890
Maybe Stanley Nayles boys
can shed some light.

622
00:38:26,490 --> 00:38:29,210
- How's Mrs Aziz?
- Terrible.

623
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:31,450
I gave her something
to help her sleep.

624
00:38:31,450 --> 00:38:32,930
Her kids are with her.

625
00:38:32,930 --> 00:38:36,010
This country,
it's not a place for us.

626
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:38,730
- They don't want us here.
- You shouldn't talk like that.

627
00:38:38,730 --> 00:38:40,480
This is our home now.

628
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:43,840
You heard there was a stabbing.

629
00:38:43,850 --> 00:38:47,130
One of our young men on the street.
That's our home.

630
00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:51,450
- That's how welcome we are.
- Did you help the police?

631
00:38:51,450 --> 00:38:56,530
I think so. They were asking about
a man called, er, Oberon Prince.

632
00:38:56,530 --> 00:39:00,370
I know him. He's off the television,
he's a chef.

633
00:39:00,370 --> 00:39:01,650
What about him?

634
00:39:01,690 --> 00:39:05,650
That's who Mr Aziz
was delivering to at Tiffin Court.

635
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:08,570
And they think he did it,
this Prince?

636
00:39:08,570 --> 00:39:11,070
He's gone missing, apparently.

637
00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:15,450
If he tries to turn that
into a Half-Nelson,

638
00:39:15,450 --> 00:39:17,170
you know what to do,
drop it right down...

639
00:39:17,170 --> 00:39:18,970
Stanley Nayle?

640
00:39:19,010 --> 00:39:20,530
Yes, gents.

641
00:39:20,570 --> 00:39:22,770
DCI Thursday, DS Morse,
Thames Valley.

642
00:39:22,770 --> 00:39:25,330
You ate in The Jolly Rajah in Oxford
on Monday night.

643
00:39:25,330 --> 00:39:27,890
Yeah, after we'd finished
at the venue.

644
00:39:27,890 --> 00:39:29,650
We heard you had words
with another patron.

645
00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:31,900
A man called Oberon Prince.

646
00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:34,410
He was taking the mickey.

647
00:39:34,410 --> 00:39:37,890
I told him to knock it off,
but he was drunk, you know.

648
00:39:37,890 --> 00:39:40,450
- He got a bit lippy with us.
- So what did you say?

649
00:39:40,450 --> 00:39:43,090
Don't know.
I suppose I just said,

650
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:45,290
"Knock it off, mate,"
or summat like that.

651
00:39:45,290 --> 00:39:46,810
You know, nothing heavy.

652
00:39:46,810 --> 00:39:48,850
- So you didn't threaten him?
- No.

653
00:39:48,850 --> 00:39:51,050
That's not Bobby's part,
in the ring or out.

654
00:39:51,050 --> 00:39:53,250
And when you left the restaurant,
where do you go?

655
00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:54,810
Well, it was getting late by then.

656
00:39:54,810 --> 00:39:56,290
Most of us
just went back to our digs.

657
00:39:56,290 --> 00:39:58,810
- Where would that be?
- We're all over.

658
00:39:58,810 --> 00:40:01,250
Ones and twos.
Couple of us here, couple there.

659
00:40:01,250 --> 00:40:03,920
Not everyone's keen on having...

660
00:40:04,410 --> 00:40:06,290
...wrestlers under their roof.

661
00:40:06,290 --> 00:40:09,770
You said "most" of you?
Some of you didn't, presumably?

662
00:40:09,770 --> 00:40:11,970
Well, I think a couple of the lads
went on to a drinker

663
00:40:11,970 --> 00:40:14,250
we sometimes go to.
Adam and the Noble Brothers.

664
00:40:14,250 --> 00:40:15,770
Adam?

665
00:40:15,810 --> 00:40:18,650
Adam, "Dangerman", Sloane.

666
00:40:18,690 --> 00:40:20,610
- And where's he?
- He tops the bill,

667
00:40:20,610 --> 00:40:21,970
so he's not with us tonight.

668
00:40:21,970 --> 00:40:24,330
Stan, our gaffer,
wanted him to rest up.

669
00:40:24,330 --> 00:40:26,330
Well, we'll need addresses
for their lodgings.

670
00:40:26,330 --> 00:40:28,330
Well, I'll have to check
my paperwork.

671
00:40:28,330 --> 00:40:29,770
All right if I phone it through?

672
00:40:29,770 --> 00:40:32,530
Look, there's some B&Bs we use
on a semi-regular,

673
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:33,730
whenever we're in town,

674
00:40:33,730 --> 00:40:36,090
but I'll have to check and see
who was where.

675
00:40:36,090 --> 00:40:37,610
Some of the lads double up, but...

676
00:40:37,610 --> 00:40:40,780
I will have a look, let you know,
yeah?

677
00:40:45,130 --> 00:40:49,380
- You ever go to the wrestling?
- What do you think?

678
00:40:51,210 --> 00:40:52,710
"Faces and heels."

679
00:40:53,770 --> 00:40:56,360
That's what the Yanks call 'em.

680
00:40:56,410 --> 00:41:00,890
Like the white hats and the black
in the cowboy pictures.

681
00:41:00,890 --> 00:41:03,330
Good guys and villains.

682
00:41:03,370 --> 00:41:05,040
Just like the opera.

683
00:41:06,930 --> 00:41:09,970
It's the "face" in a bout
the punters can root for.

684
00:41:09,970 --> 00:41:12,970
The "heel" gives 'em someone to boo.

685
00:41:14,410 --> 00:41:16,410
Sir. Morse.

686
00:41:16,450 --> 00:41:20,120
Your warrant came through
for Mrs Radowicz's.

687
00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:31,290
He's entitled to his opinion,
the same as anybody else.

688
00:41:31,290 --> 00:41:32,730
They're just not like us.

689
00:41:32,730 --> 00:41:35,050
In what way are they not like us,
Mrs Radowicz?

690
00:41:35,050 --> 00:41:36,410
All ways.

691
00:41:36,450 --> 00:41:37,930
They don't talk the way we do

692
00:41:37,930 --> 00:41:39,810
and they make a noise
till all hours,

693
00:41:39,810 --> 00:41:43,250
coming and going,
and their food smells funny.

694
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:45,570
- Their food smells funny?
- Well, it does!

695
00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:47,890
But you wouldn't know about that
because people like you

696
00:41:47,890 --> 00:41:49,690
don't have to live
on the same street as them.

697
00:41:49,690 --> 00:41:52,770
Look, do you want to see your Gary
get into even more trouble

698
00:41:52,770 --> 00:41:55,520
and end up in Borstal?
DOOR CLOSES

699
00:41:55,810 --> 00:41:58,400
- Shh, stay there!
- GARY: Mum?'

700
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:11,660
- Smoke?
- No.

701
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:14,540
Before we start,

702
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:16,900
we've got witnesses
can put you at the scene

703
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:18,100
at the time in question,

704
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:21,020
so, before you answer,
you might like to think about that.

705
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:24,020
I wasn't there.
I don't care what anybody says.

706
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:25,220
Who else was there, Gary?

707
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:27,660
I wouldn't know, would I?
Seeing as I wasn't there.

708
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:30,900
Look, it's easy to follow the pack.

709
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:35,360
Older boys, men, you wanna fit in,
be one of the lads.

710
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:38,360
Tell us about Martin Gorman.

711
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:39,860
What about him?

712
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:42,220
- Well, you like him.
- I'm not a queer.

713
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:44,460
I mean... you admire him, then.

714
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:46,900
- He talks sense.
- About what?

715
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:49,900
About the foreigners. Immigration.

716
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:52,260
The blacks. Pakis.

717
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:53,860
Coming over here,
taking all the jobs

718
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:56,060
- and the houses and that.
- What, you don't care for them?

719
00:42:56,060 --> 00:42:58,460
I don't care for
people ruining my country, no.

720
00:42:58,460 --> 00:43:00,660
Is that why you stuck a knife
in one of the Asian lads?

721
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:02,410
I didn't stab anyone.

722
00:43:04,060 --> 00:43:05,220
Gary Rogers.

723
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:08,140
What's that about?

724
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:10,380
You wanna go round my school
with a Polish name.

725
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:13,880
- See what it gets you.
- You were bullied?

726
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:16,940
Gerwazy Radowicz.

727
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:18,500
You had that hanging
round your neck,

728
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:20,260
you'd call yourself Gary Rogers
an' all.

729
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:23,420
I'm British... not Polish.

730
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:25,020
How'd your parents feel about that?

731
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:26,820
What I call myself
is none of her business.

732
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:28,580
And your father?

733
00:43:28,620 --> 00:43:29,900
Died. When I was five.

734
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:32,400
- Oh, sorry.
- There's no need.

735
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:35,220
- He's nothing to me.
- He should be.

736
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:37,860
- Why?
- He's your father.

737
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:40,300
You never knew him.
She only took up with him

738
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:42,340
for the money
she could screw out of him.

739
00:43:42,340 --> 00:43:47,260
Look... I didn't stab anyone.
I wasn't there,

740
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:48,900
and you can't put a knife
in my hand.

741
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:50,540
No, we can't.

742
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:52,620
But we do have
a group of Asian lads,

743
00:43:52,620 --> 00:43:55,380
who can pick you out of a line-up,
and they will pick you out, Gary.

744
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:56,470
KNOCK ON DOOR

745
00:43:57,980 --> 00:43:58,980
Sir?

746
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:10,460
But I thought
this boy had been recognised.

747
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:12,140
Well, no,
the eyewitness who named him

748
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:13,780
now isn't sure it was Gary
after all.

749
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:15,980
They've withdrawn
their earlier statement.

750
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:17,820
Someone put the frighteners on,
you think?

751
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:18,820
Maybe.

752
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:21,060
But whatever the cause,
we've had to let him go.

753
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:23,500
OFFICER: Sarge, the Sardar family
are asking for an update.

754
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:25,170
I'd better get that.

755
00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:29,980
Never the buggers
that load the gun, is it?

756
00:44:29,980 --> 00:44:33,900
- How's that? - Always the ones
that pull the trigger.

757
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:37,020
That tripe-hound,
Gorman's every bit as responsible

758
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:40,420
for the stabbing as the boy was,
filling his head full of rubbish.

759
00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:43,180
But nothing ever sticks
to those bastards.

760
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:45,780
British Movement.
He's a movement, all right.

761
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:47,980
May have been Gorman
who put the knife into his hand,

762
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:50,500
but it was Gary that stuck it
into another human being.

763
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:55,180
- A boy not so different from himself.
- Different enough.

764
00:44:55,180 --> 00:44:57,460
Boy doesn't know what he is yet.

765
00:44:57,460 --> 00:44:59,880
Whether he's coming or going.

766
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:03,300
English, Polish, growing up
for the most part without a father.

767
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:06,220
- Everybody has a choice.
- Do they?

768
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:10,380
I just hope the lad sees sense
about Gorman and his kind.

769
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:12,060
Got time for a pint?

770
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:14,690
Um... No, I can't, not tonight.

771
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:16,950
- Oh, no? Date, is it?
- Hm.

772
00:45:17,740 --> 00:45:20,080
I'll see you tomorrow, then.

773
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:49,500
Morse, good to see you!

774
00:45:50,620 --> 00:45:51,940
- Hello.
- Welcome.

775
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:52,940
Ludo?

776
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:59,860
Oh, I spoke prematurely.
La bella signora has returned to me.

777
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:02,820
Perhaps you should think
of flying a flag.

778
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:03,940
Hello again.

779
00:46:03,980 --> 00:46:05,900
Hello.

780
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:07,940
To indicate
that she is in residence, yes?

781
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:10,780
- Like Her Majesty.
- Exactly that.

782
00:46:11,740 --> 00:46:14,420
You've been in Monaco, Ludo says.

783
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:16,620
Monaco. Antibes.

784
00:46:16,660 --> 00:46:17,660
Right.

785
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:20,660
Well, look, I've no wish to intrude
upon a happy reunion, so I'll...

786
00:46:20,660 --> 00:46:25,500
Nonsense, we're delighted
to see you, aren't we? Of course.

787
00:46:25,540 --> 00:46:27,960
What would you like to drink?

788
00:46:31,020 --> 00:46:32,440
Whatever's going.

789
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:33,900
You shoot?

790
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:37,140
- Birds?
- No. People.

791
00:46:37,180 --> 00:46:38,300
MORSE CHUCKLES

792
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:40,700
It's a little early for game,
isn't it?

793
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:42,700
Come. Come.

794
00:46:42,740 --> 00:46:45,220
Pull!
HE SHOOTS GUN TWICE

795
00:46:47,740 --> 00:46:49,660
Did you see, darling?

796
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:52,020
- Did you see that wonderful shot?
- I saw.

797
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:54,820
How is the world of criminality?

798
00:46:54,860 --> 00:46:57,540
I read in the press about
Oberon Prince. Can that be right?

799
00:46:57,540 --> 00:46:59,740
- Yeah. Do you know him?
- Slightly.

800
00:46:59,740 --> 00:47:02,860
All right, I suppose.
He's no Robert Danvers.

801
00:47:02,860 --> 00:47:05,300
- What's this?
- Someone was murdered.

802
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:07,180
This Prince fellow is suspect.

803
00:47:07,180 --> 00:47:08,770
Will you catch him?

804
00:47:08,780 --> 00:47:11,980
I expect so. Sooner or later.
LUDO CHUCKLES

805
00:47:11,980 --> 00:47:13,660
What a blood-soaked life you lead.

806
00:47:13,660 --> 00:47:16,060
Pull!
HE SHOOTS TWICE

807
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:18,820
Yeah it's that, all right.

808
00:47:18,820 --> 00:47:21,340
No matter how many cases you solve
or bad people you put away,

809
00:47:21,340 --> 00:47:23,700
there's always another one
standing right behind them.

810
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:25,660
There speaks a devil sick of sin.

811
00:47:25,660 --> 00:47:28,340
I just wonder if
I've stayed too long at the fair.

812
00:47:28,340 --> 00:47:31,180
Why do it, if you hate it so much?

813
00:47:32,380 --> 00:47:36,220
I suppose because
I'm no good at anything else.

814
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:39,780
And because
the dead deserve justice.

815
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:42,500
There's a delivery man's
lost his life

816
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:44,860
and a... a woman left a widow.

817
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:46,380
Life, death, rich, poor.

818
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:50,620
It's all a roll of the dice, Morse.
There's no reason to any of it.

819
00:47:50,620 --> 00:47:52,580
They're not responsible.

820
00:47:52,580 --> 00:47:54,100
Some people are just unlucky.

821
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:55,580
Pull!

822
00:47:55,620 --> 00:47:59,780
GUN SHOOTS TWICE

823
00:47:59,820 --> 00:48:02,020
MAN ON TV: Britain already is part

824
00:48:02,020 --> 00:48:05,220
of the European Trade Association.

825
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:09,180
- We have applied for membership...
- All right?

826
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:11,660
Fred?

827
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:18,100
Yeah, I'm gonna take
a turn round the block.

828
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:19,740
What's up?

829
00:48:19,780 --> 00:48:20,980
Just, er...

830
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:23,380
Just work.

831
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:29,640
I'm here, you know,
if you want to talk about anything.

832
00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:35,540
Whatever it is, you'll put it right.

833
00:48:35,580 --> 00:48:37,140
It's what you do.

834
00:48:54,460 --> 00:48:56,550
I owe you an explanation.

835
00:49:01,940 --> 00:49:04,110
"No questions", wasn't it?

836
00:49:06,620 --> 00:49:08,940
A mere "goodbye"
might have been polite,

837
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:10,660
but nobody died.

838
00:49:11,820 --> 00:49:13,700
You don't owe me anything.

839
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:14,870
Can I see you?

840
00:49:21,980 --> 00:49:23,400
I don't think so.

841
00:49:26,980 --> 00:49:28,220
He's a friend.

842
00:49:32,420 --> 00:49:33,700
Affairs with married women?

843
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:37,290
I'm sorry,
it's just not my... not my scene.

844
00:49:37,740 --> 00:49:41,410
LUDO: I thought
we'd crack open the Margeaux.

845
00:49:41,420 --> 00:49:43,170
I'll leave you to it.

846
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:48,380
It'll have to be another time,
I'm afraid. Work.

847
00:49:48,380 --> 00:49:51,460
You approve? Violetta.

848
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:53,660
Oh, yeah, you're a lucky man.

849
00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:56,620
Yes, I am.
God knows what I did to deserve her.

850
00:49:56,620 --> 00:49:58,220
If I lost her,
I don't know what I'd do.

851
00:49:58,220 --> 00:50:00,020
Then don't.

852
00:50:00,060 --> 00:50:01,980
No. I don't intend to.

853
00:50:03,180 --> 00:50:05,660
MORSE CLEARS HIS THROAT
We'll go out.

854
00:50:05,660 --> 00:50:08,000
Tannheuser at Covent Garden.

855
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:11,060
Look, you can't be running around
London getting drunk with me.

856
00:50:11,060 --> 00:50:13,650
Your wife's back now. Take her.

857
00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:16,740
Violetta hates the opera.

858
00:50:16,740 --> 00:50:17,980
Next week!

859
00:50:18,020 --> 00:50:21,770
Let's do it, come on!
Best seats in the house!

860
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:37,580
OFFICER: Sir?

861
00:50:37,620 --> 00:50:39,860
THUNDER RUMBLES

862
00:50:48,220 --> 00:50:50,340
MAN WHIMPERS QUIETLY

863
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:52,540
WHIMPERING CONTINUES

864
00:51:05,820 --> 00:51:07,570
HE WHIMPERS
Mr Sardar?

865
00:51:08,740 --> 00:51:12,160
- We've been looking for you.
- Oh, hello.

866
00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:15,940
I... I must go... home.

867
00:51:17,140 --> 00:51:19,940
Course, you do.

868
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:23,260
Come on. You're drenched through.

869
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:24,470
There you are.

870
00:51:26,580 --> 00:51:30,700
You're lucky we got
a report about your wanderings.

871
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:32,500
Anyway...

872
00:51:32,540 --> 00:51:33,940
I forget things.

873
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:41,300
Well,
I'm... I'm sure we all do that.

874
00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:45,780
I'll go into a room
and I can't remember

875
00:51:45,780 --> 00:51:47,340
what I've come in for.

876
00:51:47,340 --> 00:51:49,780
Or I'll put my pipe down,

877
00:51:49,820 --> 00:51:53,860
and... damn me if I can remember
where I left it.

878
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:57,150
It's more than that,
I can't remember...

879
00:51:58,260 --> 00:52:00,260
...words.

880
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:01,660
I...

881
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:05,500
You know, conversations
I had five minutes ago.

882
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:09,000
Well, your eldest son's a doctor,
isn't he?

883
00:52:09,100 --> 00:52:13,100
- Overwork, he says.
- Well, there you are, then.

884
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:16,200
I feel like I'm...

885
00:52:18,020 --> 00:52:19,140
...fading.

886
00:52:20,380 --> 00:52:24,100
Like there's a darkness
on the edge of sight...

887
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:27,340
...slowly creeping in.

888
00:52:28,420 --> 00:52:31,940
And the more... you look

889
00:52:31,980 --> 00:52:34,650
out of the corner of your eye...

890
00:52:38,060 --> 00:52:40,860
...the more it slips out of view.

891
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:45,340
But I know it's there.

892
00:52:50,020 --> 00:52:52,500
Come on, let's get you inside.

893
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:55,340
He had been taking money, I think.

894
00:52:56,900 --> 00:52:58,020
Who had?

895
00:53:00,180 --> 00:53:01,460
Mr Aziz.

896
00:53:04,020 --> 00:53:05,580
Skimming, you call it now.

897
00:53:05,580 --> 00:53:07,780
Everyone thought
it was me forgetting,

898
00:53:07,780 --> 00:53:09,060
but it was him.

899
00:53:10,340 --> 00:53:12,980
Not enough to stand out, but...

900
00:53:14,820 --> 00:53:17,320
...over a long period of time.

901
00:53:18,540 --> 00:53:20,130
You should've said.

902
00:53:22,540 --> 00:53:24,710
I should've paid him more.

903
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:32,580
So, all that about
Uqbah coming up short

904
00:53:32,580 --> 00:53:35,100
when they cashed up of an evening
in the restaurant

905
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:39,140
was likely down to Mr Aziz
having his fingers in the till.

906
00:53:39,140 --> 00:53:42,220
I've run a registration check
on cars parked illegally

907
00:53:42,220 --> 00:53:44,140
- outside Tiffin Court.
- Where's this come from?

908
00:53:44,140 --> 00:53:45,380
The porter, Mr Comer.

909
00:53:45,380 --> 00:53:47,780
We got a few frequent customers.

910
00:53:47,780 --> 00:53:50,020
The most regular, a cream Mercedes.

911
00:53:50,020 --> 00:53:53,020
Saturday and Wednesdays,
roughly the same time.

912
00:53:53,020 --> 00:53:55,270
Any idea who it belongs to?

913
00:54:10,740 --> 00:54:13,620
ILSA: I really don't know
what I can do for you.

914
00:54:13,620 --> 00:54:16,580
Dr Sardar. You on a house call?

915
00:54:16,620 --> 00:54:19,820
If you forgive me, my private life
is none of your concern.

916
00:54:19,820 --> 00:54:22,460
It is if it has anything to do
with what happened to Mr Aziz

917
00:54:22,460 --> 00:54:23,980
in flat ten the other night.

918
00:54:23,980 --> 00:54:27,570
Why don't you sit down?
And you, Miss Trent.

919
00:54:28,060 --> 00:54:31,180
We really don't know anything
about that. Really, we don't!

920
00:54:31,180 --> 00:54:33,620
So, were you here on Monday night,
Doctor?

921
00:54:33,620 --> 00:54:36,420
We can easily find out
if your car was.

922
00:54:36,420 --> 00:54:37,900
He was gone by 11.

923
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:40,220
Did you see anyone loitering
about the place?

924
00:54:40,220 --> 00:54:43,340
No. Look, I have not broken the law.

925
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:45,660
You denied ever having heard
about Tiffin Court.

926
00:54:45,660 --> 00:54:47,700
Why do that,
unless you had something to hide?

927
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:49,140
What should I have said?

928
00:54:49,140 --> 00:54:52,140
Me and Ilsa know nothing about
what happened to poor Mr Aziz.

929
00:54:52,140 --> 00:54:54,260
OK? Just a coincidence.

930
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:57,740
So what is it that
you didn't want us to know?

931
00:54:57,740 --> 00:54:59,020
I know Prince.

932
00:54:59,060 --> 00:55:00,940
I've seen him once or twice,

933
00:55:00,940 --> 00:55:02,540
- we play cards together.
- Where?

934
00:55:02,540 --> 00:55:05,540
Here and there.
It's nothing regular.

935
00:55:06,660 --> 00:55:09,460
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I really do have patients to see.

936
00:55:09,460 --> 00:55:12,420
There's nothing else
I can tell you right now.

937
00:55:12,420 --> 00:55:13,580
So if I may?

938
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:15,700
All right.

939
00:55:18,540 --> 00:55:19,860
For now.

940
00:55:23,580 --> 00:55:25,750
We know where to find you.

941
00:55:33,220 --> 00:55:34,820
Where did you two meet?

942
00:55:34,820 --> 00:55:37,140
My father runs
a floating poker game.

943
00:55:37,140 --> 00:55:38,700

Look, my father's got nothing
to do with this.

946
00:55:44,260 --> 00:55:48,430
- I'd as soon as not say.
- We can easily find out.

947
00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:50,450
That's my dad there.

948
00:55:51,580 --> 00:55:54,780
Did Oberon Prince ever play
at your father's poker game?

949
00:55:54,780 --> 00:55:56,660
I think he was a regular, yeah.

950
00:55:56,660 --> 00:55:59,940
Not much of a card player, though,
Dad said.

951
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:02,940
Which made him the perfect addition.

Mm, some.

You forgive them?

958
00:56:28,620 --> 00:56:31,370
I'm not very good at forgiveness.

959
00:56:32,460 --> 00:56:36,050
Would you forgive me
if I did something bad?

960
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:39,350
That depends what it was.

961
00:56:40,460 --> 00:56:42,620
And if there was contrition.

962
00:56:42,620 --> 00:56:44,460
Genuine contrition.

I don't want to confess.

and renowned food critic
Oberon Prince.

The chef has not been seen

You said it was important.

00:58:55,780 --> 00:58:58,700
- I needed to see you. Alone.
- Why?

993
00:59:00,060 --> 00:59:02,730
To see if I still felt the same.

00:59:08,660 --> 00:59:10,580
...you should just make
a clean break of it.

00:59:20,740 --> 00:59:24,160

But it wasn't real.

these are wealthy individuals.

01:03:34,820 --> 01:03:37,660
- They buy and sell people like you.
- Really?

1065
01:03:37,660 --> 01:03:40,100
I can't imagine it would do
your election campaign much good

1066
01:03:40,100 --> 01:03:41,700
if it got out that
in your private life,

1067

you enjoy play cards

We're the police, we don't bluff.

While we're waiting,
we might get something

- Or in love.
- Oh, please! Love?

1080
01:04:17,980 --> 01:04:20,940
You think love'll save you
from her father's thugs?

- No. No. Of course not for you (!)

You're the Great British doctor.

01:04:33,340 --> 01:04:36,680
They tolerate you.
Because you're useful.

1087
01:04:37,500 --> 01:04:40,100
That's what... that's what they mean
by "tolerance", right?

1088
01:04:40,100 --> 01:04:43,060
Putting up with something
they'd sooner not.

1089
01:04:43,060 --> 01:04:46,500
I don't want to be tolerated.
I want to belong.

- Salim...
- I'm getting out.

1091
01:04:50,380 --> 01:04:51,500
Going home.

1092
01:04:51,540 --> 01:04:52,620
Home?

1093
01:04:54,980 --> 01:04:56,100
To Bengal?

1094
01:04:57,220 --> 01:04:58,980
And you call ME mad?!

1095
01:04:59,020 --> 01:05:02,340
- I've been talking to Cousin Arik.
- Oh, Cousin Arik the Nationalist?

1096
01:05:02,340 --> 01:05:05,140
We could be part of something.
All of us.

1100
01:05:16,380 --> 01:05:20,380
- You mean you haven't told her.
- No. He hasn't.

1101
01:05:21,780 --> 01:05:24,020
Is that's what these
late-night calls have been about?

1102
01:05:24,020 --> 01:05:26,770
We're not talking about this now.

1103
01:05:30,580 --> 01:05:32,300
I won't go back.

1104
01:05:32,340 --> 01:05:34,620
This is my home now
and I won't be driven out.

1105
01:05:34,620 --> 01:05:37,180
- Should tell him, not me.
- He's YOUR brother!

1106
01:05:37,180 --> 01:05:39,020
And he's your husband.

1107
01:05:49,980 --> 01:05:51,620
Is this all?

1108
01:05:51,660 --> 01:05:53,260
Enough, isn't it?

1109
01:05:53,300 --> 01:05:56,140
An elegant sufficiency, thank you.

1110
01:05:56,580 --> 01:05:59,540
Insofar as we appear
to have one torso,

1111
01:05:59,540 --> 01:06:02,780
together with both legs and arms,

1112
01:06:02,820 --> 01:06:06,580
but we are deficient
to the tune of one head.

1113
01:06:06,620 --> 01:06:10,420
And the mountain range
one might expect to find,

1114
01:06:10,420 --> 01:06:13,660
as the old geographers' joke has it,

1115
01:06:13,700 --> 01:06:16,620
at the end of a cockney's wristies.

1116
01:06:19,300 --> 01:06:21,140
His 'andies, Sergeant.

1117
01:06:22,820 --> 01:06:26,410
I'll know better
once I've got him laid out.

1118
01:06:26,620 --> 01:06:30,380
But in the inside compartment
in the suitcase,

1119
01:06:30,420 --> 01:06:34,220
there's a BEA airline ticket
and a passport.

1120
01:06:34,260 --> 01:06:36,680
In the name of Oberon Prince.

1121
01:06:38,740 --> 01:06:40,300
If there's nothing else, Doctor,

1122
01:06:40,300 --> 01:06:43,420
I think we'll leave you
to your jigsaw and move upwind.

1123
01:06:43,420 --> 01:06:46,590
By all means.
Shall we say two o'clock?

1124
01:06:49,580 --> 01:06:51,780
How can someone do that
to another human being?

1125
01:06:51,780 --> 01:06:53,340
He's already done the worst thing.

1126
01:06:53,340 --> 01:06:57,620
That might turn our stomachs,
but the victim's long past caring.

1127
01:06:57,620 --> 01:07:00,710
So what do we imagine
has taken place?

1128
01:07:00,740 --> 01:07:03,220
Delivery man stumbles up
on something,

1129
01:07:03,220 --> 01:07:06,660
then whoever killed Oberon Prince
had to silence him? Possibly, sir.

1130
01:07:06,660 --> 01:07:08,900
I don't think
he stumbled on anything, sir.

1131
01:07:08,900 --> 01:07:11,900
- I think Mr Aziz was sent there.
- How's that?

1132
01:07:11,900 --> 01:07:14,780
Well, I suspect someone sent him
on a wild goose chase

1133
01:07:14,780 --> 01:07:15,860
on his third delivery.

1134
01:07:15,860 --> 01:07:17,820
- Mendip Gardens West?
- Yeah. - Why?

1135
01:07:17,820 --> 01:07:19,660
Well, if I was killing two people,

1136
01:07:19,660 --> 01:07:22,740
it would be easier to deal with them
separately. Don't you think?

1137
01:07:22,740 --> 01:07:25,500
So, whoever it is kills Prince,
waits for Aziz to arrive,

1138
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:26,740
then does for him?

1139
01:07:26,740 --> 01:07:29,650
Assuming whoever it was
wanted both of them dead.

1140
01:07:29,650 --> 01:07:30,650
Two birds?

1141
01:07:37,950 --> 01:07:41,230
In the flat, I asked you
if he'd ever mentioned a Mr Aziz.

1142
01:07:41,230 --> 01:07:43,430
Now, in light
of these recent developments,

1143
01:07:43,430 --> 01:07:45,710
I'd like to know
if he knew anyone of that name.

1144
01:07:45,710 --> 01:07:47,510
No.

1145
01:07:47,550 --> 01:07:49,790
If he did,
he never mentioned anything to me.

1146
01:07:49,790 --> 01:07:54,790
Did your husband have any enemies
that you are aware of, Mrs Prince?

1147
01:07:54,790 --> 01:07:57,750
I mean, he might've given
the odd bad review

1148
01:07:57,750 --> 01:08:00,910
that some restauranteur
took exception to.

1149
01:08:00,910 --> 01:08:04,190
He could be quite difficult,
if the mood took him.

1150
01:08:04,190 --> 01:08:07,690
But nothing to warrant
something like this.

1151
01:08:08,150 --> 01:08:11,310
You're definitely sure
it's Oberon you've found?

1152
01:08:11,310 --> 01:08:12,870
You couldn't be mistaken?

1153
01:08:12,870 --> 01:08:15,070
Well, we've strong reason
to believe it is.

1154
01:08:15,070 --> 01:08:17,910
Did he have any distinguishing
features, Mrs Prince?

1155
01:08:17,910 --> 01:08:22,670
He had a... a port-wine birthmark
on his left thigh.

1156
01:08:24,750 --> 01:08:25,990
Is it that bad?

1157
01:08:25,990 --> 01:08:27,630
I'm very sorry.

1158
01:08:27,670 --> 01:08:29,310
No. Thank you.

1159
01:08:30,430 --> 01:08:31,710
SHE EXHALES SHARPLY

1160
01:08:31,710 --> 01:08:34,710
Somehow I always knew
he'd come back to me in the end.

1161
01:08:34,710 --> 01:08:36,300
One way or another.

1162
01:08:37,870 --> 01:08:42,430
Not so much dismembered
as butchered and jointed.

1163
01:08:42,470 --> 01:08:47,070
With a rudimentary proficiency
and no small amount of luck.

1164
01:08:47,070 --> 01:08:50,390
- Where?
- At the flat, presumably.

1165
01:08:50,430 --> 01:08:52,870
Place would've looked like
a slaughterhouse, wouldn't it?

1166
01:08:52,870 --> 01:08:54,830
- The bathroom?
- Well, of course,

1167
01:08:54,830 --> 01:08:56,790
that's the traditional locus,

1168
01:08:56,790 --> 01:08:58,990
for obvious reasons.

1169
01:08:59,030 --> 01:09:01,830
I'd be very surprised
if Scene Of Crime

1170
01:09:01,830 --> 01:09:04,190
didn't get a result
from the U-bend of the bath.

1171
01:09:04,190 --> 01:09:07,230
- How long would it take?
- Oh, not that long.

1172
01:09:07,230 --> 01:09:11,470
Provided you've a decent knife
and a passable bone-saw.

1173
01:09:11,470 --> 01:09:12,510
MAN ENTERS
Yes?

1174
01:09:12,510 --> 01:09:16,670
Duxbury's. The undertakers.
Here about a car crash.

1175
01:09:16,670 --> 01:09:18,030
Female. Whittaker.

1176
01:09:18,030 --> 01:09:20,230
Ah, yes, drawer six.

1177
01:09:20,270 --> 01:09:22,360
I'll show you. Excuse me.

1178
01:09:34,230 --> 01:09:36,150
Hey, can I have a word?

1179
01:09:36,910 --> 01:09:39,910
The court's been in touch.
About Molly. The trial.

1180
01:09:39,910 --> 01:09:41,790
Early in the new year
they're saying?

1181
01:09:41,790 --> 01:09:43,390
Yeah, that sounds about right.

1182
01:09:43,390 --> 01:09:44,750
Will they want me to testify?

1183
01:09:44,750 --> 01:09:46,870
Only as to what you know.

1184
01:09:46,910 --> 01:09:48,670
Look, I don't know what's going on,

1185
01:09:48,670 --> 01:09:51,760
but your guvnor's
following me around.

1186
01:09:53,870 --> 01:09:57,630
- No, you're imagining things.
- I was at the picture house, Monday.

1187
01:09:57,630 --> 01:10:00,470
He was there.
I've seen him watching my work too.

1188
01:10:00,470 --> 01:10:04,270
I've spoken to a solicitor.
It's harassment.

1189
01:10:04,310 --> 01:10:07,030
I don't want to make any trouble...

1190
01:10:07,030 --> 01:10:09,790
...but unless he lays off,
I'll have to talk to his superiors.

1191
01:10:09,790 --> 01:10:11,210
Make a complaint.

1192
01:10:16,870 --> 01:10:19,070
MAN: Oi, love!
Why don't you go home?!

1193
01:10:19,070 --> 01:10:22,110
MAN ON RADIO: Police investigating
the stabbing of an Oxford teenager

1194
01:10:22,110 --> 01:10:24,070
have now launched
a murder investigation

1195
01:10:24,070 --> 01:10:26,310
following the death of the boy
in hospital.

1196
01:10:26,310 --> 01:10:29,070
He had been admitted
after a racist attack...

1197
01:10:29,070 --> 01:10:30,950
- I don't believe it!
- He's done it again!

1198
01:10:30,950 --> 01:10:33,510
HE LAUGHS
Another win.

1199
01:10:33,550 --> 01:10:35,710
ROWDY CHATTER

1200
01:10:35,750 --> 01:10:39,080
Gary! What are you doing here?
Come 'ere.

1201
01:10:41,670 --> 01:10:44,870
Make yourself useful.
I'm out of smokes.

1202
01:10:44,870 --> 01:10:46,750
Nip along and get me
a packet of Guardsmen

1203
01:10:46,750 --> 01:10:48,110
and some Slim Panatellas.

1204
01:10:48,110 --> 01:10:50,310
I'll give you the money
when you get back.

1205
01:10:50,310 --> 01:10:53,310
CHATTER CONTINUES

1206
01:10:53,350 --> 01:10:54,910
He's a good lad.

1207
01:10:54,950 --> 01:10:57,710
Drinks!
CHATTER CONTINUES

1208
01:10:57,750 --> 01:10:59,430
MAN: Oh, no, no, no!

1209
01:11:03,790 --> 01:11:04,990
No, thanks.

1210
01:11:07,030 --> 01:11:12,360
So, you were made by Carl Sturgis
at the picture house on Monday.

1211
01:11:15,990 --> 01:11:18,190
I fancied an evening at the flicks.

1212
01:11:18,190 --> 01:11:20,310
X-rated smut?

1213
01:11:20,350 --> 01:11:23,430
Since when did you become
part of the plastic mac brigade?

1214
01:11:23,430 --> 01:11:24,770
What's going on?

1215
01:11:27,710 --> 01:11:29,550
I just wanna be sure.

1216
01:11:29,590 --> 01:11:31,350
Sure of what?

1217
01:11:32,430 --> 01:11:35,600
That we were right
about Molly Andrews.

1218
01:11:38,790 --> 01:11:42,070
Well... Sturgis is threatening
to make a complaint.

1219
01:11:42,070 --> 01:11:44,950
- He won't.
- What if he does? Let him.

1220
01:11:44,950 --> 01:11:47,700
I know you wanted it to be him...

1221
01:11:47,870 --> 01:11:49,670
...but you're obsessing
about the wrong man.

1222
01:11:49,670 --> 01:11:55,010
- You've gotta let it drop.
- Who do you think you're talking to?

1223
01:12:02,550 --> 01:12:03,590
DOOR SHUTS

1224
01:12:20,550 --> 01:12:21,590
No, wait!

1225
01:12:23,070 --> 01:12:25,070
HE BREATHES HEAVILY

1226
01:12:52,310 --> 01:12:53,830
Mrs Radowicz?

1227
01:12:53,870 --> 01:12:57,120
What is it now?
More lies about my Gary?

1228
01:13:05,030 --> 01:13:07,230
SHE WHIMPERS

1229
01:13:13,190 --> 01:13:15,520
SHE SOBS
He's... he's cold...

1230
01:13:16,710 --> 01:13:18,870
Why is he so cold?

1231
01:13:18,910 --> 01:13:21,990
You... you need to warm him up.

1232
01:13:22,030 --> 01:13:23,510
Fetch him a blanket!

1233
01:13:23,510 --> 01:13:26,760
Why... why don't you give him
a blanket?

1234
01:13:28,390 --> 01:13:30,510
He'll wake up.

1235
01:13:30,550 --> 01:13:32,910
Wake up! Wake up, wake up!

1236
01:13:32,950 --> 01:13:34,780
- Mrs Radowicz...
- No!

1237
01:13:36,030 --> 01:13:37,350
You did this.

1238
01:13:38,390 --> 01:13:40,810
You did this! You killed him!

1239
01:13:41,710 --> 01:13:45,110
SOBBING UNCONTROLLABLY:
Who did this?

1240
01:13:45,150 --> 01:13:48,150
Who hurt my boy?

1241
01:13:53,190 --> 01:13:54,550
I hate them!

1242
01:13:55,950 --> 01:14:00,630
I hate them all.
I hope they die screaming!

1243
01:14:00,670 --> 01:14:06,190
WPC Jarvis will see you home.
My sincere condolences.

1244
01:14:09,750 --> 01:14:12,310
SHE CONTINUES SOBBING

1245
01:14:22,070 --> 01:14:23,070
Jim?

1246
01:14:23,110 --> 01:14:25,350
Thought you'd want to know
soon as...

1247
01:14:25,350 --> 01:14:27,550
There's a match come through
on the thumbprint

1248
01:14:27,550 --> 01:14:29,550
at Oberon Prince's flat.

1249
01:14:31,350 --> 01:14:33,310
So you were at the Town Hall,

1250
01:14:33,310 --> 01:14:35,070
you did your wrestling,

1251
01:14:35,070 --> 01:14:36,950
then you went out
for something to eat.

1252
01:14:36,950 --> 01:14:39,150
- Remember?
- Yeah, I remember.

1253
01:14:39,150 --> 01:14:42,990
- An Indian restaurant.
- Yeah. I said I remember.

1254
01:14:42,990 --> 01:14:45,950
There was a bit of an argument
with one of the other diners.

1255
01:14:45,950 --> 01:14:47,870
You remember that?
Vaguely.

1256
01:14:47,870 --> 01:14:49,310
Man called Oberon Prince?

1257
01:14:49,310 --> 01:14:52,750
If you say so.
Where do you go after the restaurant?

1258
01:14:52,750 --> 01:14:55,430
Back to my digs.
Anyone vouch for you?

1259
01:14:55,430 --> 01:14:58,850
Yeah.
I were bunking in with Johnny Simba.

1260
01:14:59,230 --> 01:15:01,550
Right, that's interesting,
because according to this,

1261
01:15:01,550 --> 01:15:03,470
Mr Simba was sharing
with the Singh brothers,

1262
01:15:03,470 --> 01:15:06,030
and you had a single occupancy.

1263
01:15:06,030 --> 01:15:08,790
Right, well, it changes.

1264
01:15:08,830 --> 01:15:11,030
We stay in so many places,
it's hard to keep track.

1265
01:15:11,030 --> 01:15:13,230
But you just went straight back
to your digs.

1266
01:15:13,230 --> 01:15:14,630
Yeah, that's right.

1267
01:15:14,630 --> 01:15:17,950
Well, I wonder if you can tell us,
then, how your bloody thumb print

1268
01:15:17,950 --> 01:15:20,110
left an impression on a door frame

1269
01:15:20,110 --> 01:15:22,430
in a block of flats
called Tiffin Court.

1270
01:15:22,430 --> 01:15:24,630
A flat where we found a man dead,
murdered.

1271
01:15:24,630 --> 01:15:28,550
- I don't know anything about it.
- Well, we know that you were there.

1272
01:15:28,550 --> 01:15:31,050
So why don't you just tell us?

1273
01:15:32,190 --> 01:15:33,190
All right.

1274
01:15:33,230 --> 01:15:34,430
Well...

1275
01:15:35,990 --> 01:15:38,150
...Oberon were drunk,

1276
01:15:38,190 --> 01:15:41,520
and he'd been hassling the lads,
but...

1277
01:15:42,470 --> 01:15:43,830
ROWDY LAUGHTER

1278
01:15:46,790 --> 01:15:49,460
...I could see it were a front.

1279
01:15:56,150 --> 01:15:57,650
You got somewhere?

1280
01:15:59,590 --> 01:16:01,990
- Just like that?
- Why not?

1281
01:16:02,030 --> 01:16:05,790
I knew him from off the telly.
My mum likes his programmes.

1282
01:16:05,790 --> 01:16:08,230
He gave me his address
and I said I'd drop by later.

1283
01:16:08,230 --> 01:16:12,590
Your mates, the other wrestlers,
they know about your... preference?

1284
01:16:12,590 --> 01:16:13,990
Some.

1285
01:16:14,030 --> 01:16:16,190
Nobody cares.

1286
01:16:16,230 --> 01:16:18,430
I don't know about
the last time you looked,

1287
01:16:18,430 --> 01:16:21,550
but we get paid to roll about with
blokes wearing only our underpants.

1288
01:16:21,550 --> 01:16:23,750
Wrestling's just another part
of show business,

1289
01:16:23,750 --> 01:16:26,670
that's all I'm saying.
So long as you bring the crowds in,

1290
01:16:26,670 --> 01:16:28,870
nobody cares what you get up to
in your private life.

1291
01:16:28,870 --> 01:16:30,290
So what happened?

1292
01:16:31,190 --> 01:16:35,190
Right, well, me and a couple
of the lads went to the drinker

1293
01:16:35,190 --> 01:16:36,910
for an hour or so.

1294
01:16:36,950 --> 01:16:39,620
I got to his flat about one-ish.

1295
01:16:39,670 --> 01:16:41,870
Only, I couldn't get a reply
out his flat.

1296
01:16:41,870 --> 01:16:45,470
So, I buzzed a few more
until somebody answered the door.

1297
01:16:45,470 --> 01:16:47,830
He said there'd be a key
under the mat if I were late,

1298
01:16:47,830 --> 01:16:50,500
and that I should let myself in.

1299
01:16:53,550 --> 01:16:55,670
SAWING

1300
01:16:55,710 --> 01:16:57,910
There was somebody there.
I could hear 'em.

1301
01:16:57,910 --> 01:16:59,410
SAWING INTENSIFIES

1302
01:16:59,430 --> 01:17:03,910
Sounded like... I don't know...
..somebody sawing wood.

1303
01:17:03,910 --> 01:17:05,750
But you didn't see anyone?

1304
01:17:05,750 --> 01:17:09,030
Apart from the dead guy
on the floor, no.

1305
01:17:09,030 --> 01:17:13,280
I wasn't gonna hang around
and make introductions.

1306
01:17:14,710 --> 01:17:17,030
- So what happened to the knife?
- I got rid of it.

1307
01:17:17,030 --> 01:17:19,860
- Where?
- I stuck it down a drain.

1308
01:17:25,190 --> 01:17:26,670
It's where Sloan said it was.

1309
01:17:26,670 --> 01:17:28,190
It's the killer's, then.

1310
01:17:28,190 --> 01:17:30,350
That was the telephone exchange.

1311
01:17:30,350 --> 01:17:32,550
They've run down numbers
that called the restaurant.

1312
01:17:32,550 --> 01:17:35,550
And two came from
the same telephone.

1313
01:17:46,270 --> 01:17:48,750
Order two takeaways
from The Jolly Rajah...

1314
01:17:48,750 --> 01:17:51,500
only 20 yards from the phone box?

1315
01:17:52,990 --> 01:17:54,160
Why two calls?

1316
01:17:55,150 --> 01:17:58,030
Well, the first is to the bogus
address at Mendip Gardens West.

1317
01:17:58,030 --> 01:18:00,270
The second to Oberon Prince's flat
at Tiffin Court.

1318
01:18:00,270 --> 01:18:03,630
Which means whoever made the calls
needed to buy themselves time.

1319
01:18:03,630 --> 01:18:05,870
Yeah, they needed to keep
Mr Aziz distracted

1320
01:18:05,870 --> 01:18:08,070
while they got
to Tiffin Court first.

1321
01:18:08,070 --> 01:18:09,510
We'll get forensics out.

1322
01:18:09,510 --> 01:18:11,510
Needle in a haystack
after four days,

1323
01:18:11,510 --> 01:18:12,670
but we might get lucky.

1324
01:18:12,670 --> 01:18:15,430
Having a take-away
delivered to Tiffin Court, but...

1325
01:18:15,430 --> 01:18:17,230
it's not much of a plan
given that Prince

1326
01:18:17,230 --> 01:18:19,430
- had already dined at the restaurant.
- You're right,

1327
01:18:19,430 --> 01:18:21,790
but our killer didn't know
he HAD dined at the restaurant.

1328
01:18:21,790 --> 01:18:23,230
- How come?
- Because the chief stoker

1329
01:18:23,230 --> 01:18:25,650
never leaves the engine room.

1330
01:18:30,830 --> 01:18:33,410
HE SPEAKS IN AN INDIAN LANGUAGE

1331
01:18:35,590 --> 01:18:36,950
UQBAH: Rafiq.

1332
01:18:42,830 --> 01:18:45,510
Evening, Mr Sardar.
Could you come with us, please?

1333
01:18:45,510 --> 01:18:47,750
I can't leave the restaurant
in the middle of service.

1334
01:18:47,750 --> 01:18:50,750
I'm afraid you're gonna have to,
sir.

1335
01:18:52,630 --> 01:18:54,790
HE SPEAKS,
A MAN REPLIES

1336
01:19:00,950 --> 01:19:04,230
You were the only person
on the staff who didn't realise

1337
01:19:04,230 --> 01:19:07,110
that Mr Prince had already been
in the restaurant that evening.

1338
01:19:07,110 --> 01:19:09,790
You ordered Mr Aziz
to deliver a take-away to a man

1339
01:19:09,790 --> 01:19:11,110
who'd already eaten with you.

1340
01:19:11,110 --> 01:19:15,430
We've also recovered
the knife you killed Prince with.

1341
01:19:15,430 --> 01:19:18,020
How much were you into him for?

1342
01:19:20,870 --> 01:19:22,790
£13,000.

1343
01:19:25,110 --> 01:19:27,030
I tried to keep away...

1344
01:19:28,470 --> 01:19:31,470
...but the cards get into your skin.

1345
01:19:32,950 --> 01:19:37,190
- I broke the golden rule...
- Don't chase your losses.

1346
01:19:37,190 --> 01:19:40,110
Next time, the hand will be better.

1347
01:19:40,430 --> 01:19:43,230
You always think
your luck will turn.

1348
01:19:43,230 --> 01:19:46,030
And there's nobody in your family
that could've loaned that to you?

1349
01:19:46,030 --> 01:19:47,230
Loaned?

1350
01:19:48,510 --> 01:19:50,430
That was mine by right.

1351
01:19:51,550 --> 01:19:54,750
My half of the business.
What should have been my half.

1352
01:19:54,750 --> 01:19:55,750
The profits.

1353
01:19:56,790 --> 01:20:00,290
If my brother had remembered
our agreement.

1354
01:20:01,550 --> 01:20:05,790
All I wanted was my fair share,
50-50, that is what we agreed.

1355
01:20:05,790 --> 01:20:08,960
But your brother went back
on his word.

1356
01:20:09,310 --> 01:20:13,350
He said, "Don't worry yourself
with overheads and loans

1357
01:20:13,350 --> 01:20:16,910
"and credit and debit and...

1358
01:20:16,950 --> 01:20:21,190
"Just concentrate on the cooking,
leave the worrying to me."

1359
01:20:21,190 --> 01:20:23,190
You felt cheated?

1360
01:20:23,230 --> 01:20:24,710
I WAS cheated.

1361
01:20:27,070 --> 01:20:30,740
He said he couldn't remember
our arrangement.

1362
01:20:32,910 --> 01:20:36,030
He said, "Don't worry,
you will be sorted out,

1363
01:20:36,030 --> 01:20:37,350
"you will be looked after."

1364
01:20:37,350 --> 01:20:38,470
My nephews?

1365
01:20:39,590 --> 01:20:41,840
Taking care of their uncle?

1366
01:20:42,510 --> 01:20:45,470
Like I am some beggar man?

1367
01:20:45,510 --> 01:20:47,470
So you began stealing
from the restaurant

1368
01:20:47,470 --> 01:20:49,670
in order to pay your debt
to Oberon Prince.

1369
01:20:49,670 --> 01:20:51,950
It wasn't that your brother
was losing his faculties

1370
01:20:51,950 --> 01:20:55,110
and getting the sums wrong,
you were stealing from him.

1371
01:20:55,110 --> 01:20:57,110
What was it, Mr Aziz discovered you?

1372
01:20:57,110 --> 01:20:58,510
He saw me.

1373
01:20:58,550 --> 01:21:00,300
Did he blackmail you?

1374
01:21:01,430 --> 01:21:02,990
No.

1375
01:21:05,270 --> 01:21:09,110
He gave me a chance to come clean
and tell Uqbah, or he would.

1376
01:21:09,110 --> 01:21:13,590
So you came up with a plan
to solve all your problems.

1377
01:21:13,630 --> 01:21:15,750
Two birds with one stone.

1378
01:21:17,190 --> 01:21:20,470
You kill Oberon Prince,
which eradicates your debt,

1379
01:21:20,470 --> 01:21:22,630
and you frame him for killing Aziz.

1380
01:21:22,630 --> 01:21:27,470
So your brother never discovers
that you were stealing from him.

1381
01:21:27,470 --> 01:21:31,230
You think it's going to be easy
to do this... to someone.

1382
01:21:31,230 --> 01:21:33,230
It is easy in your head.

1383
01:21:33,910 --> 01:21:36,580
But with another human being...

1384
01:21:38,270 --> 01:21:39,910
...it is not easy.

1385
01:21:40,950 --> 01:21:41,950
No.

1386
01:21:45,230 --> 01:21:50,670
One minute, they are
a living, breathing creature...

1387
01:21:50,710 --> 01:21:54,910
and... and then
they're just meat and bones.

1388
01:21:56,750 --> 01:21:59,170
It's a bad thing I have done.

1389
01:22:00,030 --> 01:22:01,710
A wicked thing.

1390
01:22:03,070 --> 01:22:06,070
And I feel ashamed for it.

1391
01:22:06,110 --> 01:22:09,860
It is one thing to know yourself
to be weak...

1392
01:22:10,790 --> 01:22:13,910
I am a gambler. I am a thief.

1393
01:22:15,470 --> 01:22:19,390
...but it is another thing
when the people you love...

1394
01:22:19,390 --> 01:22:20,890
know what you are.

1395
01:22:22,030 --> 01:22:24,150
I gave in to temptation.

1396
01:22:26,790 --> 01:22:30,370
How could I ever look them
in the eye again?

1397
01:22:33,390 --> 01:22:34,750
I had no choice.

1398
01:22:38,390 --> 01:22:39,730
What could I do?

1399
01:22:50,190 --> 01:22:51,190
Look...

1400
01:22:52,350 --> 01:22:56,030
- What you said earlier...
- I was speaking out of turn.

1401
01:22:56,030 --> 01:22:57,430
No, no.

1402
01:22:57,470 --> 01:22:59,060
Maybe you're right.

1403
01:23:00,390 --> 01:23:03,470
All this with Carl Sturgis.

1404
01:23:05,310 --> 01:23:07,980
You just get obsessed sometimes.

1405
01:23:09,830 --> 01:23:11,080
I'll let it go.

1406
01:23:19,430 --> 01:23:20,830
All well, is it?

1407
01:23:21,990 --> 01:23:22,990
With you?

1408
01:23:26,110 --> 01:23:27,110
Always.

1409
01:23:29,670 --> 01:23:31,090
See you tomorrow.

1410
01:23:37,470 --> 01:23:40,910
MAN OVER SPEAKER: For a better
Oxford and a better Britain...

1411
01:23:40,910 --> 01:23:44,230
vote Archibald-Lake.
Vote Conservative.

1412
01:23:44,270 --> 01:23:48,830
A vote for the Conservative Party
is a vote for a better tomorrow.

1413
01:23:48,830 --> 01:23:50,750
Whatever the result tonight,

1414
01:23:50,750 --> 01:23:55,710
you can see what happens
when you mix their culture and ours.

1415
01:23:55,710 --> 01:24:00,510
Not 24 hours since,
we lost a foot soldier.

1416
01:24:01,590 --> 01:24:03,550
A good patriate.

1417
01:24:03,590 --> 01:24:07,340
- Young Gary Rogers.
- MRS RADOWICZ: Radowicz!

1418
01:24:09,990 --> 01:24:13,030
Gerwazy Radowicz.

1419
01:24:17,270 --> 01:24:18,520
Mrs Radowicz...

1420
01:24:24,550 --> 01:24:26,470
He was my boy.

1421
01:24:31,270 --> 01:24:34,990
You killed him.
Just as much as they did.

1422
01:24:36,590 --> 01:24:39,180
Filling his head with all this.

1423
01:24:42,310 --> 01:24:43,470
We all did.

1424
01:25:01,110 --> 01:25:03,950
My only brother stealing from me.

1425
01:25:06,030 --> 01:25:10,430
And killing... poor Mr Aziz.

1426
01:25:11,670 --> 01:25:15,420
- If only I had...
- It'll be all right, Baba.

1427
01:25:15,550 --> 01:25:17,140
It'll be all right.

1428
01:25:23,030 --> 01:25:27,590
I'll make sure he's looked after.
He can come and live with us.

1429
01:25:27,590 --> 01:25:28,670
Us?

1430
01:25:29,790 --> 01:25:33,230
Me and Ilsa. We're getting married.

1431
01:25:34,830 --> 01:25:38,630
So, when you leave...
We're staying.

1432
01:25:40,950 --> 01:25:45,390
All this anger, all the violence,
and all this hatred?

1433
01:25:46,550 --> 01:25:48,950
In the end, it defeats only itself.

1434
01:25:48,950 --> 01:25:52,280
And burns itself out
like a stubble fire.

1435
01:25:53,030 --> 01:25:55,510
We'll see Baba's looked after
between the both of us,

1436
01:25:55,510 --> 01:25:58,030
and Salim will take over
the restaurant.

1437
01:25:58,030 --> 01:25:59,150
With my help.

1438
01:26:00,190 --> 01:26:03,610
A good husband always listens
to his wife.

1439
01:26:03,870 --> 01:26:05,450
As you'll find out.

1440
01:26:10,070 --> 01:26:12,950
OPERA MUSIC PLAYS SOFTLY

1441
01:26:19,550 --> 01:26:21,230
DOORBELL RINGS

1442
01:27:19,310 --> 01:27:23,590
SOMEONE WHISTLING,
CLATTERING

1443
01:27:29,310 --> 01:27:30,910
MAN ON RADIO: Ten o'clock.

1444
01:27:30,910 --> 01:27:32,670
The polling stations
have just closed,

1445
01:27:32,670 --> 01:27:34,630
and if the exit polls
are to be believed,

1446
01:27:34,630 --> 01:27:40,300
we are in for a very tight night,
and a remarkably close contest...

1447
01:27:41,550 --> 01:27:45,030
SOMEONE WHISTLING

1448
01:27:53,390 --> 01:27:56,150
HIGH-PITCHED SOUND EFFECT

1449
01:27:57,070 --> 01:28:01,530
