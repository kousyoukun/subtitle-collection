1
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,859
<i>And that's your biggest worry?</i>

2
00:00:08,883 --> 00:00:10,132
<i>Yes, any kind of virus,</i>

3
00:00:10,156 --> 00:00:11,405
<i>but most probably
something similar</i>

4
00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:12,196
<i>to influenza.</i>

5
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:13,614
<i>Because of air travel.</i>

6
00:00:13,638 --> 00:00:14,970
<i>Through the air.</i>

7
00:00:14,994 --> 00:00:16,326
- Coughing...
- Uh, I-I'm sorry.

8
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:18,119
I meant people. On planes.

9
00:00:18,143 --> 00:00:19,933
Uh, that was something
you described in your book.

10
00:00:19,957 --> 00:00:21,925
Yes, a new virus
in Madagascar, say,

11
00:00:21,949 --> 00:00:23,916
could be in Chicago
within a matter of weeks.

12
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:25,919
And we end up with a global
pandemic. Pan meaning "all."

13
00:00:25,943 --> 00:00:29,256
The whole world
becomes sick all at once.

14
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,174
Hm... and, uh, Dr. Neuman,

15
00:00:31,198 --> 00:00:33,092
you're also an epidemiologist.

16
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:35,303
I presume the prospect
of a viral pandemic

17
00:00:35,327 --> 00:00:35,721
keeps you up at night as well.

18
00:00:35,745 --> 00:00:37,513
- No.
- No?

19
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:39,266
- No.
- All right, well, that's our show.

20
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:40,933
No.

21
00:00:40,957 --> 00:00:43,311
Mankind has been at war
with the virus from the start.

22
00:00:43,335 --> 00:00:45,689
Sometimes, millions of
people die, as in an actual war.

23
00:00:45,713 --> 00:00:48,107
But in the end, we always win.

24
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:51,069
Uh, but you... Uh, just to
be clear, you, you do think

25
00:00:51,093 --> 00:00:52,967
microorganisms pose a threat.

26
00:00:52,991 --> 00:00:54,865
Oh, in the most dire terms.

27
00:00:54,889 --> 00:00:56,574
- Bacteria.
- No.

28
00:00:56,598 --> 00:00:57,474
- You like saying no.
- Yes.

29
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:01,872
Not bacteria. Not viruses.

30
00:01:01,896 --> 00:01:03,771
- So?
- Fungus.

31
00:01:05,648 --> 00:01:07,461
Yes, that's the usual response.

32
00:01:07,485 --> 00:01:08,879
Fungi seem harmless enough.

33
00:01:08,903 --> 00:01:10,296
Many species know otherwise.

34
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,426
Because there are
some fungi who seek not to kill...

35
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:15,781
but to control.

36
00:01:15,805 --> 00:01:17,136
Let me ask you,

37
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,637
where do we get LSD from?

38
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:20,557
Where do you get it from?

39
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:22,684
It comes from ergot, a fungus.

40
00:01:22,708 --> 00:01:24,331
Psilocybin? Also a fungus.

41
00:01:24,355 --> 00:01:25,978
Viruses can make us ill,

42
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:28,606
but fungi can alter
our very minds.

43
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:31,234
There's a fungus
that infects insects.

44
00:01:31,258 --> 00:01:32,943
Gets inside an ant, for example,

45
00:01:32,967 --> 00:01:36,573
travels through its circulatory
system to the ant's brain,

46
00:01:36,597 --> 00:01:39,263
and then floods it
with hallucinogens,

47
00:01:39,287 --> 00:01:41,952
thus bending the ant's
mind to its will.

48
00:01:41,976 --> 00:01:43,830
The fungus starts to
direct the ant's behavior,

49
00:01:43,854 --> 00:01:45,790
telling it where to go,
what to do,

50
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:47,751
like a puppeteer
with a marionette.

51
00:01:47,775 --> 00:01:49,251
And it gets worse.

52
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:50,169
The fungus needs food to live,

53
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:54,216
so it begins to devour
its host from within,

54
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,967
replacing the ant's flesh
with its own,

55
00:01:55,991 --> 00:01:58,887
but it doesn't
let its victim die.

56
00:01:58,911 --> 00:02:01,807
No, it... it keeps
its puppet alive

57
00:02:01,831 --> 00:02:03,891
by preventing decomposition.

58
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:06,561
How? Where do we
get penicillin from?

59
00:02:06,585 --> 00:02:09,063
- Fungus.
- Oh...

60
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:10,419
Dr. Schoenheiss,
you're in distress.

61
00:02:10,443 --> 00:02:11,775
Fungal infection
of this kind is real,

62
00:02:11,799 --> 00:02:13,359
but not in humans.

63
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:15,236
True, fungi cannot survive

64
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:18,552
if its host's internal
temperature is over 94 degrees.

65
00:02:18,576 --> 00:02:21,868
And currently, there are no
reasons for fungi to evolve

66
00:02:21,892 --> 00:02:23,286
to be able to withstand
higher temperatures.

67
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,663
But what if that were to change?

68
00:02:24,687 --> 00:02:27,706
What if... for instance,

69
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:30,793
the world were
to get slightly warmer?

70
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:33,879
Well, now there is
reason to evolve.

71
00:02:33,903 --> 00:02:37,571
One gene mutates and an
ascomycete, uh, candida, ergot,

72
00:02:37,595 --> 00:02:41,263
cordyceps, aspergillus,
any one of them could become

73
00:02:41,287 --> 00:02:42,596
capable of burrowing
into our brains

74
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:47,227
and taking control not of
millions of us, but billions of us.

75
00:02:47,251 --> 00:02:50,313
Billions of puppets
with poisoned minds

76
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:53,399
permanently fixed
on one unifying goal:

77
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:57,904
to spread the infection
to every last human alive

78
00:02:57,928 --> 00:02:59,363
by any means necessary.

79
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:00,073
And there are no
treatments for this.

80
00:03:00,097 --> 00:03:03,367
No preventatives, no cures.

81
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:05,203
They don't exist.
It's not even possible

82
00:03:05,227 --> 00:03:07,580
to make them.

83
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:10,690
So if that happens?

84
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:12,734
We lose.

85
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:17,947
Uh, we'll be back.

86
00:04:58,089 --> 00:05:00,714
Alarm.

87
00:05:00,738 --> 00:05:03,385
Alarm!

88
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:21,715
- Where's the pancake mix?
- Oh, was I...

89
00:05:21,739 --> 00:05:23,132
Yeah, I was. Sorry.

90
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,884
I was gonna make you
birthday pancakes.

91
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:26,218
I swear.

92
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:28,721
You know I don't
really like pancakes.

93
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:31,330
I know you don't like them.
It was for my benefit.

94
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:36,419
Vitamin C.

95
00:05:45,344 --> 00:05:48,389
You get your, uh, homework done?

96
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:51,559
Fractions?

97
00:05:53,644 --> 00:05:54,914
How old are you again?

98
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:56,749
Thirty-six.

99
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:57,876
Gonna have to wear diapers soon.

100
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,567
Who says I don't already?

101
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:03,797
Shell.

102
00:06:03,821 --> 00:06:04,673
Calcium.

103
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:07,176
Lovely.

104
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,763
Is there enough for Uncle Tommy?

105
00:06:09,787 --> 00:06:11,204
Well, there would've been.

106
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:13,974
Ay!

107
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:15,352
You're still alive,
you old fucker.

108
00:06:15,376 --> 00:06:16,226
Aw, he loves you.

109
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:19,021
He's dependent on me.
Not the same.

110
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:21,107
- I think it's the same.
- It's definitely the same.

111
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:23,692
I thought we was
havin' pancakes.

112
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:25,194
We'll pick you somethin' up
on the road.

113
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:27,280
- Concrete guys gonna be there?
- Yeah, they said maybe.

114
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:28,865
Maybe?
We can't frame until we pour.

115
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:30,074
We're not gettin' paid
until we frame.

116
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:31,680
Well, we could bring
someone else on,

117
00:06:31,704 --> 00:06:33,286
- get the job done faster.
- No, no.

118
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:34,286
I'm not splittin' this job.

119
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:35,955
I barely wanna
split it with you.

120
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:37,331
We could work a double.

121
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:39,959
- Literally? Today?
- I know. I'd be done by nine.

122
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:41,484
By nine, right?

123
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:44,254
Yeah.

124
00:06:44,278 --> 00:06:46,091
I'll bring back a cake.

125
00:06:46,115 --> 00:06:47,240
I promise.

126
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:52,138
<i>...continued
disturbances in Jakarta,</i>

127
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:53,931
<i>but are advising
U.S. citizens...</i>

128
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:55,724
Jakarta.
Where is that, Middle East?

129
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:57,893
Doesn't ring a
bell. It's definitely a country.

130
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:00,062
- Or maybe part of Asia?
- Jakarta isn't a country.

131
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:02,649
Being a part of Asia isn't mutually
exclusive with being a country,

132
00:07:02,673 --> 00:07:04,984
and in fact, it's the
capital of Indonesia.

133
00:07:05,008 --> 00:07:07,426
Shit. Hope for us yet.

134
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:15,994
All right.

135
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:17,538
Finish up quick,
we'll drop you off.

136
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:20,375
- I'm still eating my eggshells.
- You got seven minutes.

137
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:22,275
Your t-shirt's inside out.

138
00:07:25,444 --> 00:07:26,779
Shit.

139
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:32,451
He's losin' it.

140
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:13,701
Sarah!

141
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:21,603
Hey, neighbor!

142
00:08:21,627 --> 00:08:22,728
Oh, hi.

143
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:24,813
Uh, Connie was askin' after you,

144
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:27,275
since you haven't
been over in a while.

145
00:08:27,299 --> 00:08:29,735
Make 'em happy.

146
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,217
I could come by after
school, but just for, like,

147
00:08:32,241 --> 00:08:34,699
- a little bit?
- Oh, she'll take whatcha got.

148
00:08:34,723 --> 00:08:37,702
Y'all can bake, whatever.

149
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:39,244
Speakin' of...

150
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:40,871
we got a lotta extra here.

151
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:43,082
Y'all, y'all want some biscuits?

152
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:45,316
Dad, you love biscuits.

153
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:50,005
I do.

154
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:52,591
But I'm on Atkins.

155
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:55,303
- On what now?
- It's, uh... You know what?

156
00:08:55,327 --> 00:08:56,262
We gotta run,
but Sarah'll be by later.

157
00:08:56,286 --> 00:08:59,515
She'll stay as long as you want.

158
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:00,432
Tell ya all about Atkins.

159
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:03,937
Great! I'll let Connie know.

160
00:09:03,961 --> 00:09:05,086
Solid.

161
00:09:08,464 --> 00:09:11,110
Can't tell you how exciting it was
listenin' to that fuckin' conversation.

162
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:13,612
Put that out.

163
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:15,054
Happy birthday to you.

164
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:28,544
Want you to write this
diagram out exactly as I have it.

165
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:31,130
Always subject and predicate.

166
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:33,423
Verb and noun.

167
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:36,928
Okay, the sentence is, "Where
are you going?" Subject is you.

168
00:09:36,952 --> 00:09:39,430
You... are going.

169
00:09:39,454 --> 00:09:40,639
Predicate.

170
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:41,848
Where, adverb.

171
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:45,311
You see it? Okay. Have
some nods, shaking of heads.

172
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:46,354
I swear you will use this
later in life.

173
00:09:46,378 --> 00:09:48,231
Believe me,
that's why you're here.

174
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:50,172
Okay? So...

175
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:58,366
Yes, you need to know this!

176
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:01,285
Yes, it's on
your test next week!

177
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:05,104
Homework is due
end of class tomorrow!

178
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:00,927
Twenty.

179
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:02,055
That's it?

180
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:04,348
Okay, 30.

181
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:05,390
Twenty's good.

182
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:08,668
It's a spring.
I'll do it right now.

183
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:28,604
All day. I swear.

184
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:34,151
- We're closing.
- Huh?

185
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:36,088
We're done for today.

186
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:41,676
It's 3:15, we close at 7.

187
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,202
- I'm very sorry. He cannot finish.
- I'm already finished.

188
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:49,708
You should go home.

189
00:12:08,727 --> 00:12:10,957
- There you are, sweetie.
- Sorry.

190
00:12:10,981 --> 00:12:11,832
I was gettin' worried.

191
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:14,525
I was getting
something for my dad.

192
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:16,235
Hi, Mercy.

193
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,801
Hey, is everything okay?
Like, on the news?

194
00:12:21,825 --> 00:12:23,677
Like what, hon?

195
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:27,223
Well, no, there was just a lot of
police and stuff on the road today.

196
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:29,057
Well, that's true
every day, innit?

197
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:31,852
People out there need
to get right with Jesus.

198
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:34,670
Three nails, plus one
cross, equals four-given.

199
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:38,776
I was thinkin' we'd
make some cookies.

200
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,486
Chocolate chip?

201
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:43,637
Raisin.

202
00:12:49,393 --> 00:12:51,538
C'mon, Mama. It's green.

203
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:54,751
You love that. Oh!

204
00:12:54,775 --> 00:12:55,667
Here we go!

205
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:59,130
I don't know why I talk to her.

206
00:12:59,154 --> 00:13:01,197
She's completely deaf.

207
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:31,037
You wanna give me a hand?

208
00:13:31,061 --> 00:13:32,228
Be right there!

209
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,957
Hey, Mrs. Adler?

210
00:13:55,981 --> 00:13:57,628
Could I borrow this?

211
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:59,213
Oh!

212
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:02,442
Yeah, sure.

213
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:04,569
It's one of Danny's.

214
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:06,447
You know what? My dad's
gonna be back real soon.

215
00:14:06,471 --> 00:14:08,323
- I should go.
- You sure?

216
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:10,933
- Yeah.
- Well, you're takin' some cookies.

217
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:02,336
<i>No comment
today from the Austin Police Department</i>

218
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:05,589
<i>regarding a rash of violent
incidents across the city,</i>

219
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:08,843
<i>some suggesting a new
street drug may be to blame.</i>

220
00:15:08,867 --> 00:15:10,343
<i>More on that when we return,</i>

221
00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:12,306
<i>with Manuela Sanchez
reporting live...</i>

222
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:21,814
You locked the door for once.

223
00:15:21,838 --> 00:15:23,086
Good job.

224
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:24,380
Yeah.

225
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:31,281
- It's 10.
- I know.

226
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:34,889
They... gave us the
wrong size for the headers.

227
00:15:34,913 --> 00:15:38,497
That doesn't mean
anything to ya. I'm sorry.

228
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:40,457
Where's the cake?

229
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:42,230
- Shit.
- C'mon, man.

230
00:15:42,254 --> 00:15:44,002
I'll get us one tomorrow.

231
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:47,256
Swear, or you don't
get your present.

232
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:50,009
- You got me a present?
- Swear.

233
00:15:50,033 --> 00:15:51,158
On my life.

234
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:01,960
Wow.

235
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:05,589
Fixed it for you.

236
00:16:12,596 --> 00:16:13,865
- Did you?
- What?

237
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:15,284
I don't hear anything.

238
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:18,078
That was lame.

239
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:20,872
- You're lame.
- Yeah, I know.

240
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:22,875
Where'd you get
the money for this?

241
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:24,418
Drugs. I sell hardcore drugs.

242
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:25,960
It's better than what I do.

243
00:16:25,984 --> 00:16:28,922
It was only $20,
which I stole from you.

244
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:32,051
I could've stolen 60,
but I put the change back

245
00:16:32,075 --> 00:16:33,844
- because I'm an honest thief.
- Mm.

246
00:16:33,868 --> 00:16:35,637
Besides, it's the
thought that counts.

247
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:37,541
And you were never gonna
do it for yourself, so.

248
00:16:43,001 --> 00:16:44,086
Thank you.

249
00:16:47,005 --> 00:16:48,632
Oh! There's one more.

250
00:16:51,009 --> 00:16:54,156
- Borrowed it from the Adlers.
- Oh, this is the one with the deleted scenes.

251
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:56,324
Yeah, imagine how
bad those have to be.

252
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:59,393
C'mon, pop it in. While
it's still your birthday.

253
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:10,359
- Don't fall asleep.
- 'Course, I won't.

254
00:17:10,383 --> 00:17:12,531
It's too riveting.

255
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:34,779
Hello?

256
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:35,448
<i>Joel, it's me.</i>

257
00:17:35,472 --> 00:17:38,450
<i>Uh, I'm okay.</i>

258
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:41,494
- Yeah?
<i>- But I'm in jail.</i>

259
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:43,788
- Goddammit.
<i>- Wasn't my fault this time.</i>

260
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:46,917
<i>I was at the bar, some guy goes
crazy, starts swingin' at a waitress,</i>

261
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:48,669
<i>I stepped in, knocked
him out, cops show up...</i>

262
00:17:48,693 --> 00:17:49,961
<i>Look, it doesn't fuckin' matter.</i>

263
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:51,546
<i>- You gotta bail me out.</i>
- Now?

264
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,132
<i>It's Friday, you
don't get me out tonight,</i>

265
00:17:53,156 --> 00:17:54,632
<i>I'm in here all weekend.</i>

266
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:56,301
<i>It's a fuckin' madhouse, Joel.</i>

267
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:58,804
<i>- I gotta get out.</i>
- Well, which jail? Travis County?

268
00:17:58,828 --> 00:18:00,263
<i>Yeah, on 10th.</i>

269
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:03,559
- Goddammit, Tommy.
<i>- I'm sorry.</i>

270
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,793
<i>Please.</i>

271
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,645
Okay.

272
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:10,130
Fuckin' idiot.

273
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:13,902
Dad?

274
00:19:23,036 --> 00:19:24,745
Dad?!

275
00:19:41,096 --> 00:19:42,887
<i>...indoors.</i>

276
00:19:42,911 --> 00:19:44,701
<i>Law enforcement
and emergency services</i>

277
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:48,103
<i>are in the area and will be in
contact with further instructions.</i>

278
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:52,816
<i>Stay indoors, law enforcement...</i>

279
00:19:57,029 --> 00:20:01,909
Shh, shh... Easy. Easy, Mercy.

280
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:04,786
What're you doing out here, boy?

281
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,649
C'mon, let's get you home.

282
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:40,299
C'mon, Mercy. Please.

283
00:20:40,323 --> 00:20:43,450
Mercy!

284
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:55,629
Mrs. Adler?

285
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:15,816
Mrs. Adler?

286
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:47,097
Mrs. Adler?

287
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:02,738
Help me.

288
00:22:53,121 --> 00:22:55,559
Get in the truck! Right now!

289
00:22:55,583 --> 00:22:57,625
Move!

290
00:23:08,386 --> 00:23:08,678
What are we doin', Joel?

291
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:28,257
- You killed her.
- Baby, I'm sorry.

292
00:23:28,281 --> 00:23:29,968
- Joel, we gotta go.
- Sarah, listen to me.

293
00:23:29,992 --> 00:23:31,282
It's not just the Adlers.

294
00:23:31,306 --> 00:23:32,595
But we're gonna be brave,

295
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:34,389
and we're gonna get outta this.

296
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:36,331
Hey. Let's go. Come on.

297
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:39,209
Get in.

298
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:42,313
Joel?

299
00:23:42,337 --> 00:23:44,065
Denise, you get
back inside the house!

300
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:46,424
- You lock your doors! Now!
- C'mon, c'mon, get in!

301
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:57,853
- Get your seat belt on.
- Hold on.

302
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:03,024
Jesus Christ, Joel!

303
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:09,906
- You take 70...
- 71, I know.

304
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:19,934
- Daddy...
- We don't know.

305
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:21,186
They're saying it's a virus.

306
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:22,436
Some kind of parasite.

307
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:24,022
Is it from terrorists?

308
00:24:24,046 --> 00:24:26,732
We don't know.

309
00:24:26,756 --> 00:24:28,944
- Are we sick?
- No. Of course not.

310
00:24:28,968 --> 00:24:30,320
Why did things blow up?

311
00:24:30,344 --> 00:24:32,613
No cellphone, no radio.

312
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:33,906
Minute ago,
newsman wouldn't shut up.

313
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:35,200
- How do you know?
- What?

314
00:24:35,224 --> 00:24:38,369
How do you know we're not sick?

315
00:24:38,393 --> 00:24:40,998
They're saying
it's mostly people in the city.

316
00:24:41,022 --> 00:24:43,023
That's why they got
the highway blocked off.

317
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:47,044
God.

318
00:24:47,068 --> 00:24:49,779
It's Jimmy's place.

319
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:01,226
The Adlers would take
Nana into the city.

320
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:02,935
To the hospital for stuff.

321
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:06,004
That's right. They would.
That's probably why.

322
00:25:07,547 --> 00:25:12,154
But... you'd have
to go a lot... right?

323
00:25:12,178 --> 00:25:12,802
We're fine. Trust me.

324
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:19,226
All right.

325
00:25:23,396 --> 00:25:25,437
Here! Right here!

326
00:25:25,461 --> 00:25:27,501
- Hey!
- What are you doin'?

327
00:25:27,525 --> 00:25:30,296
- Got a kid, Joel.
- So do we. Keep driving.

328
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,030
We could put them in the back.

329
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:37,619
Somebody else'll come along.

330
00:25:48,129 --> 00:25:50,024
Fuck! Everybody had
the same fuckin' idea.

331
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:51,943
I can't get through this.

332
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:54,571
All right, all right. Let's think it
through, we'll think it through.

333
00:25:54,595 --> 00:25:56,197
- Fuck!
- All right, take the field.

334
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:58,116
We cut across and we pick
up on the, on the west side.

335
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:58,951
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
West, west, all right.

336
00:25:58,975 --> 00:26:01,142
All right, hang on.

337
00:26:14,489 --> 00:26:16,717
Shit! Fuckin' army.

338
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:18,678
- Isn't that good?
- It's good for them,

339
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:20,639
but that's the highway
we're tryin' to get to.

340
00:26:20,663 --> 00:26:22,139
All right, keep
movin'. Head north.

341
00:26:22,163 --> 00:26:23,850
- Could be a lot of people.
- Well, we can't go south,

342
00:26:23,874 --> 00:26:25,560
we can't go east,
we can't go west.

343
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:27,544
Hell else we supposed to go?

344
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:29,337
Tommy, come on!

345
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:36,195
Yeah.

346
00:26:36,219 --> 00:26:37,113
Yeah, I know that place.

347
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:38,739
- This can work.
- Yeah, but then what?

348
00:26:38,763 --> 00:26:41,535
I don't know. Mexico.
Just far, far as we can.

349
00:26:41,559 --> 00:26:43,828
- How much gas?
- Three-quarter tank.

350
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:46,740
Go through town, golf course
by the river, straight across,

351
00:26:46,764 --> 00:26:49,675
we pick up the highway on
the other side of the blockade...

352
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:53,320
then we're out.

353
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:01,369
Maybe it's everywhere.

354
00:27:02,495 --> 00:27:05,165
Maybe there's nowhere to go.

355
00:27:10,086 --> 00:27:11,775
What the fuck?!

356
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:26,413
Son of a bitch. Gotta go around.

357
00:27:26,437 --> 00:27:27,604
Grab somethin'!

358
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:44,826
All right, keep goin',
keep goin'.

359
00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:46,539
Shit. Tommy!

360
00:27:49,417 --> 00:27:51,937
Tommy, you can't stop here.

361
00:27:51,961 --> 00:27:53,565
- I can't drive through 'em all.
- Are you serious?!

362
00:27:53,589 --> 00:27:54,505
Just keep goin'!

363
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:01,405
Go, go, go. Back, back, back,

364
00:28:01,429 --> 00:28:03,181
- back, back, back, back!
- I'm trying!

365
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:09,413
Tommy, go faster! We gotta go!

366
00:28:09,437 --> 00:28:10,582
I'm tryin'!
There's nowhere to fuckin' go!

367
00:28:10,606 --> 00:28:12,166
- Find an alley!
- What alley?!

368
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:13,710
- There's people everywhere!
- Roll the fuck over them!

369
00:28:13,734 --> 00:28:15,252
We gotta get
off this street now!

370
00:28:15,276 --> 00:28:16,858
That's what
I'm tryin' to do, Joel.

371
00:28:16,882 --> 00:28:18,465
We're gonna be
okay. Just keep drivin'.

372
00:28:18,489 --> 00:28:20,591
Dad?!

373
00:28:20,615 --> 00:28:21,991
Holy shit!

374
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,910
Move... move!

375
00:28:56,734 --> 00:28:59,255
Sarah... Sarah.

376
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:00,738
Stay right there. Don't move.

377
00:29:02,031 --> 00:29:03,467
Tommy, you okay?

378
00:29:03,491 --> 00:29:05,367
Yeah, I'm okay.

379
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:20,547
Sarah... don't look.

380
00:29:20,571 --> 00:29:22,695
You look at me... okay?

381
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:24,489
I'm sorry, baby, I know, I know.

382
00:29:24,513 --> 00:29:25,949
Come here.
Put your arms around me.

383
00:29:25,973 --> 00:29:27,992
Come here, come here.

384
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:30,787
I got you. I got... I got you.

385
00:29:30,811 --> 00:29:33,080
Got you.

386
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:35,167
Are you okay?

387
00:29:35,191 --> 00:29:35,916
- Mm-mm.
- Are you okay?

388
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,793
- My ankle.
- All right, okay.

389
00:29:37,817 --> 00:29:39,587
We gotta get off the street!

390
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:41,404
Shit!

391
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:46,178
Tommy?!

392
00:29:46,202 --> 00:29:48,513
Tommy?!

393
00:29:48,537 --> 00:29:50,848
Tommy!

394
00:29:50,872 --> 00:29:53,768
Head to the river!
I'll find a way.

395
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,627
Get her outta here, Joel! Go!

396
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:58,440
- We can't leave him.
- He'll be fine.

397
00:29:58,464 --> 00:30:00,173
- Can you run?
- No.

398
00:30:01,007 --> 00:30:02,861
- You keep your eyes on me.
- Okay.

399
00:30:02,885 --> 00:30:03,694
- Okay?
- Okay.

400
00:30:03,718 --> 00:30:05,864
And don't look anywhere else.

401
00:30:05,888 --> 00:30:07,054
Alright.

402
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:07,717
It's okay, baby. You're safe.

403
00:31:07,741 --> 00:31:10,719
Don't move!

404
00:31:10,743 --> 00:31:13,871
- My daughter's hurt. Her ankle.
- Stop right there!

405
00:31:14,747 --> 00:31:15,683
Okay.

406
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:18,519
Easy now. We're not sick!

407
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:21,084
I got two civilians
by the river,

408
00:31:21,108 --> 00:31:23,650
one of 'em injured.

409
00:31:23,674 --> 00:31:25,214
Ankle.

410
00:31:25,238 --> 00:31:26,777
What about Uncle Tommy?

411
00:31:26,801 --> 00:31:28,613
We're gonna get you
somewhere safe first.

412
00:31:28,637 --> 00:31:30,782
Then we'll go back
for him, okay?

413
00:31:30,806 --> 00:31:31,865
- Okay.
- Okay.

414
00:31:31,889 --> 00:31:33,722
I'm sorry, repeat?

415
00:31:33,746 --> 00:31:35,602
Hey! No one told you to move.

416
00:31:39,897 --> 00:31:42,900
Yes, sir.

417
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:47,030
Yes, sir.

418
00:31:49,616 --> 00:31:51,492
We're not sick.

419
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:55,472
Sir...

420
00:31:55,496 --> 00:31:56,873
we are not sick!

421
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:11,346
I'm sorry.

422
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:14,182
Please, don't.

423
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:25,192
Oh God.

424
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,967
No. Oh no.

425
00:32:31,991 --> 00:32:35,013
No, no. No.

426
00:32:35,037 --> 00:32:37,514
Okay...

427
00:32:37,538 --> 00:32:38,433
You're okay.
Move your hand, baby.

428
00:32:38,457 --> 00:32:40,541
Move your hand.

429
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:49,027
I know, baby, I know,
I know, I know, I know.

430
00:32:49,051 --> 00:32:50,527
I know it hurts.

431
00:32:50,551 --> 00:32:52,739
Alright. Don't
look down, look up, look up.

432
00:32:52,763 --> 00:32:56,784
Come on, baby.
You're okay, you're okay.

433
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:59,120
I know, I know, I know,
I know, baby, I know, I know.

434
00:32:59,144 --> 00:33:00,580
I know this hurts.

435
00:33:00,604 --> 00:33:02,039
You're gonna be okay.

436
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:05,752
All right... baby, baby,
baby, listen to me.

437
00:33:05,776 --> 00:33:07,921
I gotta get you up, okay?

438
00:33:07,945 --> 00:33:09,505
I gotta get you up.

439
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:10,548
All right? You come on.

440
00:33:10,572 --> 00:33:13,592
You come on. I know, baby.

441
00:33:13,616 --> 00:33:16,388
No, no. I know, I know, I
know, I know, I know, I know.

442
00:33:16,412 --> 00:33:17,912
Tommy, help me!

443
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:19,580
Joel.

444
00:33:20,873 --> 00:33:21,975
C'mon, baby girl.

445
00:33:21,999 --> 00:33:24,062
C'mon, baby girl,
I gotta get you up.

446
00:33:24,086 --> 00:33:25,187
Come on.

447
00:33:25,211 --> 00:33:26,522
Come on, we'll get up.

448
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:28,005
Come on, baby girl.

449
00:33:29,215 --> 00:33:31,571
Come on... come... Please.

450
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:19,385
We don't want you
falling out of the chair.

451
00:36:19,969 --> 00:36:21,554
What's your name?

452
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:24,974
Are you alone?

453
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:33,542
And, uh...

454
00:36:33,566 --> 00:36:35,776
how did you get this?

455
00:36:38,988 --> 00:36:41,908
There's gonna be a
little tickle right here.

456
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,980
What if I told you that after
we gave you some medicine,

457
00:36:54,004 --> 00:36:56,357
we're gonna find you
your favorite food to eat.

458
00:36:56,381 --> 00:36:58,567
Would you like that?

459
00:36:58,591 --> 00:37:02,196
And then we'll get you
some new clothes... and toys.

460
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,180
As many as you wanna play with.

461
00:37:07,975 --> 00:37:10,394
It's just a little needle.

462
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:13,981
It's okay.

463
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:20,320
You're safe.

464
00:38:24,218 --> 00:38:25,386
I can't.

465
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:06,427
Ten.

466
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:19,167
- You got anything else?
- Nothin' today.

467
00:39:19,191 --> 00:39:21,734
Tomorrow, we got
street sweeping...

468
00:39:22,985 --> 00:39:24,651
or sewer maintenance.

469
00:39:24,675 --> 00:39:26,340
Which pays more?

470
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:28,115
That'd be the one with the shit.

471
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:35,581
Late crew. 4 P.M. start.

00:41:07,089 --> 00:41:08,507
You're short five.

487
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:30,821
- Oxy?
- Hydro.

488
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:33,216
- How old?
- Three months.

489
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,093
- From Atlanta?
- I don't know where he gets 'em from.

490
00:41:34,117 --> 00:41:35,218
I just know they're real.

491
00:41:35,242 --> 00:41:37,512
If it's real, it's from Atlanta.

492
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:40,057
FEDRA's got a factory
down there in the QZ.

493
00:41:40,081 --> 00:41:41,916
Supposedly
only makes two things.

494
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:45,937
Pills and bullets,
bullets and pills.

495
00:41:45,961 --> 00:41:48,524
Well, the more you shoot people,
the harder it is to sleep, I guess.

496
00:41:48,548 --> 00:41:50,633
Oh, you guess?

497
00:41:51,884 --> 00:41:52,885
You want 'em or not?

498
00:41:58,474 --> 00:41:59,892
I need the bag back.

499
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:06,541
- How we doin' with the vehicle?
- All set.

500
00:42:06,565 --> 00:42:07,960
Just had to get one last
guy in the depot to buy in.

501
00:42:07,984 --> 00:42:09,252
Okay, how much?

502
00:42:09,276 --> 00:42:12,798
Four of them
on that shift plus me...

503
00:42:12,822 --> 00:42:14,841
six hundred total.

504
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:17,428
Look, those trucks are
shitheaped for a reason.

505
00:42:17,452 --> 00:42:19,284
And they don't have
any batteries. I know.

506
00:42:19,308 --> 00:42:21,140
I can see about 200
for the other guys...

507
00:42:21,164 --> 00:42:23,040
two hundred for you.

508
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:26,252
Deal.

509
00:42:28,087 --> 00:42:30,815
Hey, do yourself a favor...

510
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:33,318
stay off the streets
for the next few nights.

511
00:42:33,342 --> 00:42:35,821
Fuckin' Fireflies been
blowin' shit up all week.

512
00:42:35,845 --> 00:42:36,530
Two of our guys
got shot this morning.

513
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:39,116
Boss has got us working doubles.

514
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:40,474
Guys are jumpy and tired.

515
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:43,619
It's easy to make
a mistake in the dark.

516
00:42:45,938 --> 00:42:47,982
Stay safe.

517
00:42:48,857 --> 00:42:49,149
Yeah, you too.

518
00:43:10,587 --> 00:43:13,108
What do you
want me to say, Tess?

519
00:43:13,132 --> 00:43:15,676
I'm not askin'
you to say anything.

520
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:20,764
Sure.

521
00:43:21,807 --> 00:43:25,978
It's not like I planned
on... rippin' you off.

522
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:28,188
I'm sorry.

523
00:43:29,315 --> 00:43:30,357
Well...

524
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:34,361
how about we just let it go?

525
00:43:42,077 --> 00:43:44,015
What else are you gonna do?

526
00:43:44,039 --> 00:43:45,181
Ya gonna keep me here?

527
00:43:45,205 --> 00:43:47,475
- Kill me?
- Tess, c'mon.

528
00:43:47,499 --> 00:43:49,769
Then, Robert... what do ya want?

529
00:43:49,793 --> 00:43:51,230
I want you to forget
this ever happened.

530
00:43:51,254 --> 00:43:52,647
Done.

531
00:43:52,671 --> 00:43:54,107
- Don't do that.
- What?

532
00:43:54,131 --> 00:43:55,775
It's just a truck
battery. I paid you for it,

533
00:43:55,799 --> 00:43:58,069
you sold it to someone else,
and you spent my money.

534
00:43:58,093 --> 00:44:00,384
I mean, you think I've
never done shit like that?

535
00:44:00,408 --> 00:44:02,668
- My guys fucked you up.
- Yeah, so discipline them.

536
00:44:02,692 --> 00:44:04,952
You cut off a finger or
whatever the fuck you want.

537
00:44:04,976 --> 00:44:06,536
I don't care.
They're your fuckin' guys.

538
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:10,081
What about your guy?
'Cause when he sees you,

539
00:44:10,105 --> 00:44:13,919
- I mean, put yourself in my shoes.
- Look, he answers to me.

540
00:44:13,943 --> 00:44:17,610
So, I give you my word
that he won't hurt you.

541
00:44:17,634 --> 00:44:20,978
I'll tell him that I got
jumped by... some guys,

542
00:44:21,002 --> 00:44:24,370
and then you and I
can just move the fuck on.

543
00:44:26,663 --> 00:44:30,060
Now your shit has pretty
much ruined my week,

544
00:44:30,084 --> 00:44:34,231
and I'd like to go home and
drink 'til my face stops hurting.

545
00:44:34,255 --> 00:44:35,881
So, are we good?

546
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:43,472
Yeah.

547
00:44:55,651 --> 00:44:58,338
<i>All citizens must clear</i>

548
00:44:58,362 --> 00:44:59,798

558
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:47,512
Oh shit.

559
00:45:47,536 --> 00:45:50,057
Firefly, up top!

560
00:45:50,081 --> 00:45:51,832
Free Boston now, motherfuckers!

561
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:05,531
- They're shooting. They're shooting at us.
- On your knees.

562
00:46:05,555 --> 00:46:07,723
- On your knees!
- No, no! I'm not a F...

563
00:46:11,477 --> 00:46:13,770
I'm not a, I'm not a Firefly!

564
00:46:43,842 --> 00:46:46,237
Count slowly and clearly
from one to 10.

565
00:46:46,261 --> 00:46:48,032
- One, two, three, four...
- Slowly...

566
00:46:48,056 --> 00:46:49,515
and clearly.

567
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:51,725
One.

568
00:46:52,809 --> 00:46:54,287
Two.

569
00:46:54,311 --> 00:46:55,684
Three.

570
00:46:55,708 --> 00:46:57,113
Four.

571
00:46:57,137 --> 00:46:58,098
Five.

572
00:46:58,122 --> 00:46:59,550
Six.

573
00:46:59,574 --> 00:47:01,026
Seven.

574
00:47:01,735 --> 00:47:02,900
Eight.

575
00:47:02,924 --> 00:47:04,224
Fuck...

576
00:47:04,248 --> 00:47:05,572
you.

577
00:47:07,741 --> 00:47:09,886
And hold out your...

578
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:13,891
- State your name, slowly and clearly.
- Veronica.

579
00:47:13,915 --> 00:47:17,394
Same as yesterday...
and the day before...

580
00:47:17,418 --> 00:47:19,729
and the day before, and the...

581
00:47:19,753 --> 00:47:21,732
Hey, people are gonna
come looking for me.

582
00:47:21,756 --> 00:47:23,566
People from FEDRA. You hear me?

583
00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:25,801
Let me out or you're
gonna pay, motherfuckers!

584
00:47:28,345 --> 00:47:30,639
I'm not supposed to be here!

585
00:48:04,673 --> 00:48:06,610
Hey, there's a line!

586
00:48:06,634 --> 00:48:08,737
"Tell Dad it's a girl.

587
00:48:08,761 --> 00:48:10,447
"That would be good, right?

588
00:48:10,471 --> 00:48:12,157
"He wanted a granddaughter.

589
00:48:12,181 --> 00:48:14,993
Love, Becca."

590
00:48:15,017 --> 00:48:16,643
End message. Read back.

591
00:48:21,356 --> 00:48:23,609
Correct... 73-K Orlando. Out.

592
00:48:42,337 --> 00:48:43,545
Nothin'?

593
00:48:44,796 --> 00:48:47,359
Is there any chance
it's comin' in at night?

594
00:48:47,383 --> 00:48:48,925
You're sleepin', you miss it?

595
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:50,844
Hm.

596
00:48:53,221 --> 00:48:56,117
When I'm sleeping,
Gabriela listens, or my son.

597
00:48:56,141 --> 00:48:59,061
The smart one, not the
other one, God bless him.

598
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:02,999
If Tommy responded, we'd know.

599
00:49:03,023 --> 00:49:05,001
- And you're talkin' to the tower?
- Every day.

600
00:49:05,025 --> 00:49:06,837
They gave him your message,
they haven't seen or heard

601
00:49:06,861 --> 00:49:09,672
from him since, and that's it.

602
00:49:09,696 --> 00:49:11,926
- It hasn't been that long.
- It's been three weeks.

603
00:49:11,950 --> 00:49:14,204
It's never taken him
more than a day to respond.

604
00:49:16,244 --> 00:49:17,287
I'm sure he's okay.

605
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:24,503
Show me where the tower is.

606
00:49:26,046 --> 00:49:27,172
Oh, you can't be serious.

607
00:49:29,091 --> 00:49:30,693
J-Joel, it's in Wyoming.

608
00:49:30,717 --> 00:49:32,841
Uh, all-all this open country?

609
00:49:32,865 --> 00:49:34,989
I mean, you're a capable guy,

610
00:49:35,013 --> 00:49:38,369
but there are worse things
than Infected out there.

611
00:49:38,393 --> 00:49:40,119
I hear everything on this.

612
00:49:40,143 --> 00:49:42,081
There are raiders,
there are slavers...

613
00:49:42,105 --> 00:49:43,397
But you're "sure" Tommy's okay?

614
00:49:51,488 --> 00:49:52,906
It's, uh, it's the Cody tower...

615
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:57,786
Q-Bar 4, but I don't
know exactly wh...

616
00:50:04,167 --> 00:50:07,212
Next!

617
00:51:47,687 --> 00:51:48,665
<i>You know what, Joel...</i>

618
00:51:48,689 --> 00:51:51,691
<i>Joel!</i>

619
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:52,270
I got jumped by a couple guys.

620
00:52:52,294 --> 00:52:54,314
- What guys?
- Just a couple teenagers.

621
00:52:54,338 --> 00:52:56,381
Said some shit,
probably shouldn't've.

622
00:52:58,508 --> 00:53:00,988
Come on. You know these
guys were born after the outbreak.

623
00:53:01,012 --> 00:53:03,323
Never learned how to argue.
They just start swingin'.

624
00:53:03,347 --> 00:53:05,265
Fuckin' 19-year-old
pieces of shit.

625
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:08,018
It's a miracle you're alive.

626
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:11,021
It's a miracle
any of us are alive.

627
00:53:13,481 --> 00:53:14,774
These aren't new.

628
00:53:15,108 --> 00:53:17,086
No.

629
00:53:17,110 --> 00:53:19,946
I was in FEDRA lockup all day.

630
00:53:21,239 --> 00:53:23,885
Anyway, it doesn't matter.

631
00:53:23,909 --> 00:53:25,389
- I need you to take a breath.
- What?

632
00:53:27,829 --> 00:53:29,831
- Joel...
- What?

633
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,124
The guys who jumped me
were with Robert.

634
00:53:34,148 --> 00:53:36,296
He sold our battery
to someone else.

635
00:53:37,797 --> 00:53:41,111
Nothing's lost. Shit like
this is gonna happen.

636
00:53:41,135 --> 00:53:42,778
Now we just shake it off,

637
00:53:42,802 --> 00:53:45,240
and we go get our
cards back, or the battery.

638
00:53:45,264 --> 00:53:47,117
I need the battery, Tess.

639
00:53:47,141 --> 00:53:48,993
Truck's no good without one,

640
00:53:49,017 --> 00:53:50,120
and if I don't
get to Tommy soon,

641
00:53:50,144 --> 00:53:51,288
he's gonna die out there.

642
00:53:51,312 --> 00:53:52,204
Okay, fuck it.

643
00:53:52,228 --> 00:53:53,248
We get our money back

644
00:53:53,272 --> 00:53:54,228
and the battery.

645
00:53:54,252 --> 00:53:55,207
But, Joel, listen,

646
00:53:55,231 --> 00:53:57,293
Robert is terrified of you.

647
00:53:57,317 --> 00:53:59,129
So you march outta here
all Clint Eastwood,

648
00:53:59,153 --> 00:54:00,964
he's gonna get
wind of it and skip.

649
00:54:00,988 --> 00:54:03,323
I need you to take a breath.

650
00:54:09,037 --> 00:54:10,619
- Who'd he sell it to?
- Don't know.

651
00:54:10,643 --> 00:54:12,248
- Well, where is he?
- Don't know.

652
00:54:13,792 --> 00:54:15,603
Yet.

653
00:54:15,627 --> 00:54:18,732
But we're gonna
find out... quietly.

654
00:54:18,756 --> 00:54:21,484
Understand?

655
00:54:21,508 --> 00:54:23,802
Now I promised Robert
that you wouldn't hurt him.

656
00:54:25,095 --> 00:54:28,116
But I would very much
like for you to hurt him.

657
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:31,161
So let's go hunt
that motherfucker down,

658
00:54:31,185 --> 00:54:33,080
and get our battery
and our truck,

659
00:54:33,104 --> 00:54:36,375
and then we'll go find Tommy.

660
00:54:36,399 --> 00:54:39,526
All right?

661
00:54:40,443 --> 00:54:43,488
All right.

662
00:55:04,175 --> 00:55:06,594
The team in place
at Southeast 3?

663
00:55:08,179 --> 00:55:09,264
I held them back.

664
00:55:10,598 --> 00:55:12,369
I have some questions.

665
00:55:12,393 --> 00:55:13,685
Hm... Okay.

666
00:55:14,811 --> 00:55:17,249
We've been blowing up
meaningless FEDRA targets

667
00:55:17,273 --> 00:55:19,543
spread out all over
the QZ, for two weeks.

668
00:55:19,567 --> 00:55:21,860
We've already lost
four people, and we're...

669
00:55:22,986 --> 00:55:24,154
What's the point of this?

670
00:55:25,822 --> 00:55:27,049
Is that your question?

671
00:55:27,073 --> 00:55:28,300
That's one of them.

672
00:55:28,324 --> 00:55:30,553
My answer is to follow
fuckin' orders.

673
00:55:30,577 --> 00:55:32,930
And why do you have some
random girl locked in a room?

674
00:55:32,954 --> 00:55:35,308
And the guys you have
guarding her won't tell me shit?

675
00:55:35,332 --> 00:55:37,581
Our people are asking
what's going on,

676
00:55:37,605 --> 00:55:39,823
and I don't know
what to tell them.

677
00:55:39,847 --> 00:55:42,070
Tell them to follow
fuckin' orders.

678
00:55:42,094 --> 00:55:44,340
You two, go to Southeast 3. Now.

679
00:55:50,722 --> 00:55:52,408
- Kim.
- Marlene.

680
00:55:52,432 --> 00:55:55,078
We are in a war against
a military dictatorship

681
00:55:55,102 --> 00:55:56,913
to restore democracy
and freedom.

682
00:55:56,937 --> 00:55:57,977
Does that sound about right?

683
00:55:58,001 --> 00:55:59,113
- Yes?
- Are we winning?

684
00:55:59,137 --> 00:56:00,249
Are we beating FEDRA here?

685
00:56:00,273 --> 00:56:01,917
Are the Fireflies
beating FEDRA anywhere?

686
00:56:01,941 --> 00:56:03,919
- Rebellion takes time.
- You fight for 20 years

687
00:56:03,943 --> 00:56:05,922
and you get nowhere,
you're not a rebellion.

688
00:56:05,946 --> 00:56:08,799
Just spray paint.

689
00:56:08,823 --> 00:56:11,886
We're not hitting FEDRA
"all over" the QZ.

690
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:14,996
We hit 'em here,
here, here, here, here.

691
00:56:15,663 --> 00:56:16,915
Where are we right now?

692
00:56:19,042 --> 00:56:21,041
I want FEDRA
everywhere but here.

693
00:56:21,065 --> 00:56:22,991
I want them as
distracted as possible

694
00:56:23,015 --> 00:56:24,941
because tonight,
every Firefly in Boston

695
00:56:24,965 --> 00:56:26,484
is gonna gather
in this building,

696
00:56:26,508 --> 00:56:28,885
and we are gonna leave
the QZ. Permanently.

697
00:56:30,095 --> 00:56:31,781
- We're quitting?
- No.

698
00:56:31,805 --> 00:56:34,974
We're taking that random
girl locked in that room west.

699
00:56:36,935 --> 00:56:39,104
From our guy in the
radio tower in Salem.

700
00:56:46,903 --> 00:56:49,197
Is this real?

701
00:56:49,906 --> 00:56:51,491
I believe it is.

702
00:56:54,911 --> 00:56:57,956
Keep it quiet.

703
00:56:59,541 --> 00:57:01,123
Whatever you need.

704
00:57:01,147 --> 00:57:02,728
Whatever it takes.

705
00:57:02,752 --> 00:57:04,754
We'll get her
where she needs to go.

706
00:57:34,117 --> 00:57:36,971
Hey, friend.

707
00:57:36,995 --> 00:57:38,974
Don't worry.
I don't want anything.

708
00:57:38,998 --> 00:57:40,683
But if you're feelin' lost...

709
00:57:40,707 --> 00:57:43,067
You tell me to "look for the
light" and I'll break your jaw.

710
00:57:54,012 --> 00:57:57,200
Well, I mean, it cost us a couple
of cards, but, uh, we got him.

711
00:57:57,224 --> 00:58:00,412
He's supposedly takin' the
battery to a red-tagged building.

712
00:58:00,436 --> 00:58:04,541
But get this... corner
of Stillman and Cross.

713
00:58:04,565 --> 00:58:06,251
The one Miguel used to use.

714
00:58:06,275 --> 00:58:08,002
Yeah, I'm thinkin' so.

715
00:58:08,026 --> 00:58:09,212
I mean, we can take the
subway tunnel under Haymarket,

716
00:58:09,236 --> 00:58:11,673
get into the building
from below,

717
00:58:11,697 --> 00:58:13,884
and take Robert by surprise.

718
00:58:13,908 --> 00:58:15,283
Pay this fucker back.

719
00:58:23,666 --> 00:58:26,711
Oh, my God.

720
00:58:29,923 --> 00:58:31,925
Agh! You fucker!

721
00:58:37,263 --> 00:58:40,808
One, two, three, four...

722
00:59:08,044 --> 00:59:10,046
You're not scared.

723
00:59:13,091 --> 00:59:14,902
Then unlock me.

724
00:59:14,926 --> 00:59:16,571
How about we start
with "thank you"?

725
00:59:16,595 --> 00:59:17,947
For what?

726
00:59:17,971 --> 00:59:19,490
For saving your life?

727
00:59:19,514 --> 00:59:20,242
I am the one who told 'em
not to shoot you,

728
00:59:20,266 --> 00:59:23,184
- if you recall.
- Yeah.

729
00:59:30,483 --> 00:59:32,211
Why did you stop them?

730
00:59:32,235 --> 00:59:33,987
We'll get to that.

731
00:59:48,084 --> 00:59:49,502
So... Veronica...

732
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:54,173
how ya feelin'?

733
00:59:54,966 --> 00:59:57,010
The same.

734
00:59:58,177 --> 01:00:00,555
Is it gonna happen?

735
01:00:01,973 --> 01:00:03,766
No.

736
01:00:07,103 --> 01:00:08,229
So, can I go?

737
01:00:09,272 --> 01:00:09,999
No.

738
01:00:10,023 --> 01:00:12,085
I won't tell anyone
about any of this.

739
01:00:12,109 --> 01:00:13,335
I swear.

740
01:00:13,359 --> 01:00:14,503
Where you gonna go?

741
01:00:14,527 --> 01:00:16,255
Back to FEDRA military school?

742
01:00:16,279 --> 01:00:19,384
- You that anxious to be a soldier?
- You think I chose that place?

743
01:00:19,408 --> 01:00:21,261
They put me there
when I was a baby.

744
01:00:21,285 --> 01:00:22,594
It's for orphans.

745
01:00:22,618 --> 01:00:25,747
"They" didn't put you there.

746
01:00:26,497 --> 01:00:27,540
I did.

747
01:00:28,458 --> 01:00:31,502
Ellie.

748
01:00:32,503 --> 01:00:35,483
You my fucking mom or something?

749
01:00:35,507 --> 01:00:37,110
Do I look like your mom?

750
01:00:37,134 --> 01:00:40,345
Nooo, you do not.

751
01:00:41,179 --> 01:00:42,865
My name is Marlene.

752
01:00:42,889 --> 01:00:44,809
I'm the leader of the
Fireflies in the Boston QZ.

753
01:00:46,642 --> 01:00:48,579
Why would a terrorist
dump me with FEDRA?

754
01:00:48,603 --> 01:00:50,623
Because it's where you'd be
safest, and you were safe there

755
01:00:50,647 --> 01:00:51,041
until you decided to sneak out.

756
01:00:51,065 --> 01:00:52,774
And "terrorist"?

757
01:00:54,317 --> 01:00:55,735
Was Riley a terrorist?

758
01:01:12,627 --> 01:01:15,088
Why won't you let me go home?

759
01:01:18,341 --> 01:01:19,443
Because you have
a greater purpose

760
01:01:19,467 --> 01:01:20,593
than any of us
could've ever imagined.

761
01:01:22,678 --> 01:01:24,365
So we're leaving tonight,

762
01:01:24,389 --> 01:01:26,099
and we're taking you with us.

763
01:01:28,768 --> 01:01:30,978
- He's here.
- Five minutes.

764
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:37,819
What I'm about to tell you
cannot be repeated to anyone.

765
01:01:38,611 --> 01:01:40,423
Because if you do...

766
01:01:40,447 --> 01:01:41,781
I assure you...

767
01:01:43,449 --> 01:01:45,034
you will die.

768
01:02:07,390 --> 01:02:08,516
Okay.

769
01:02:09,475 --> 01:02:10,911
Ready?

770
01:02:10,935 --> 01:02:14,063
Yeah.

771
01:02:29,287 --> 01:02:32,331
Oh, that's the one.

772
01:02:54,729 --> 01:02:56,311
Oh! Oh fuck.

773
01:02:56,335 --> 01:02:57,940
Oh shit.

774
01:03:00,067 --> 01:03:01,152
This one's done.

775
01:03:03,654 --> 01:03:05,174
Yeah...

776
01:03:05,198 --> 01:03:06,508
I know. I just...

777
01:03:06,532 --> 01:03:08,135
I wasn't expecting it.

778
01:03:08,159 --> 01:03:09,785
Take it he wasn't
down here last time?

779
01:03:10,161 --> 01:03:11,954
No.

780
01:03:13,789 --> 01:03:17,853
You think he came down
after he was infected?

781
01:03:17,877 --> 01:03:21,339
Well, maybe down
here is where he was infected.

782
01:03:25,927 --> 01:03:27,553
Let's keep movin'.

783
01:03:41,651 --> 01:03:44,047
It's like they reframed
the whole structure.

784
01:03:44,071 --> 01:03:45,547
Probably in the '80s.

785
01:03:45,571 --> 01:03:46,466
Everyone was cutting
down on apartment sizes

786
01:03:46,490 --> 01:03:49,218
- to sell more condos.
- Oh.

787
01:03:49,242 --> 01:03:53,932
"This has been 'Construction
Corner' with Joel Miller."

788
01:03:53,956 --> 01:03:55,957
- How far up we goin'?
- Uh...

789
01:03:57,959 --> 01:03:59,043
this far.

790
01:04:01,754 --> 01:04:06,693
So, this... this opens
into the ha-hallway.

791
01:04:06,717 --> 01:04:08,803
What the fuck? Someone
put a piano in front of this?

792
01:04:12,181 --> 01:04:14,016
You smell that?

793
01:04:15,935 --> 01:04:18,020
Yeah... gunpowder.

794
01:04:24,527 --> 01:04:25,820
Tess.

795
01:04:46,716 --> 01:04:48,840
Well, the battery's no good.

796
01:04:48,864 --> 01:04:51,012
And he still tried to sell it.

797
01:04:51,887 --> 01:04:52,972
Twice.

798
01:04:54,056 --> 01:04:55,682
You greedy fuck.

799
01:05:08,904 --> 01:05:10,967
Shit.

800
01:05:10,991 --> 01:05:12,617
Oh God. Just...

801
01:05:14,910 --> 01:05:17,496
Oh shit, come on.

802
01:05:23,836 --> 01:05:25,963
Fuck.

803
01:05:27,965 --> 01:05:29,008
Joel?

804
01:05:29,383 --> 01:05:31,218
Marlene?

805
01:05:32,511 --> 01:05:35,348
- You okay?
- Yeah.

806
01:05:37,850 --> 01:05:39,162
Ellie...

807
01:05:39,186 --> 01:05:40,561
Ellie!

808
01:05:42,938 --> 01:05:44,792
- Oh shit!
- No, it's okay. I'll be all right.

809
01:05:44,816 --> 01:05:46,859
And you can't be
stupid like this.

810
01:05:49,153 --> 01:05:51,674
So this is who Robert
screwed us over with?

811
01:05:51,698 --> 01:05:52,758
The Che Guevara of Boston?

812
01:05:52,782 --> 01:05:55,135
I mean, war must
be goin' pretty shitty

813
01:05:55,159 --> 01:05:57,055
for you to be buying
from scumbags like him.

814
01:05:57,079 --> 01:05:57,555
Yeah, it kinda has been.

815
01:05:57,579 --> 01:05:59,890
The merch was bad,

816
01:05:59,914 --> 01:06:01,825
and he obviously didn't
take "fuck off" for an answer.

817
01:06:01,849 --> 01:06:03,784
- Gimme my knife.
- What do you need a car battery for?

818
01:06:04,627 --> 01:06:06,253
- Don't.
- Not at her.

819
01:06:08,297 --> 01:06:09,674
Point it at me.

820
01:06:22,603 --> 01:06:23,455
And to answer your question,

821
01:06:23,479 --> 01:06:25,124
I need it for a better
reason than you do.

822
01:06:25,148 --> 01:06:28,043
No offense,
but Tommy's just one man.

823
01:06:28,067 --> 01:06:30,295
- It's our business to know things.
- "To know things."

824
01:06:30,319 --> 01:06:33,549
You're the cause of it. You
turned my own brother against me.

825
01:06:33,573 --> 01:06:34,925
- Okay, Joel.
- That was a lot of gunfire.

826
01:06:34,949 --> 01:06:36,325
- FEDRA's gonna be on the way.
- I know.

827
01:06:42,248 --> 01:06:44,393
We were gonna move
Ellie outta the zone tonight.

828
01:06:44,417 --> 01:06:46,646
But we won't make it anywhere
like this. Not for a while anyway.

829
01:06:46,670 --> 01:06:48,627
So now I'm thinkin'...

830
01:06:48,651 --> 01:06:50,607
you're gonna do it.

831
01:06:50,631 --> 01:06:51,984
- The hell we are.
- I'm not goin' with them!

832
01:06:52,008 --> 01:06:53,110
- Let me take her.
- Tess...

833
01:06:53,134 --> 01:06:54,236
we don't have time for this.

834
01:06:54,260 --> 01:06:55,445
Oh, you don't have time?

835
01:06:55,469 --> 01:06:56,280
- Who is she?
- To you? She's cargo.

836
01:06:56,304 --> 01:06:57,907
We don't smuggle people. Sorry.

837
01:06:57,931 --> 01:06:59,450
- I can do it.
- Kim, you don't have

838
01:06:59,474 --> 01:07:00,993
a fuckin' ear
on your fuckin' head.

839
01:07:01,017 --> 01:07:03,412
Could you please?

840
01:07:03,436 --> 01:07:04,705
There's a team of Fireflies

841
01:07:04,729 --> 01:07:06,102
waiting for her
at the old State House.

842
01:07:06,126 --> 01:07:07,499
I know what's out there.

843
01:07:07,523 --> 01:07:11,087
We were going with an entire
squadron for that very reason.

844
01:07:11,111 --> 01:07:12,880
But now I don't have a
truck, I don't have a squadron,

845
01:07:12,904 --> 01:07:14,298
FEDRA's five minutes away.

846
01:07:14,322 --> 01:07:16,216
What I do have is you.

847
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:18,970
And I know what
you're both capable of.

848
01:07:18,994 --> 01:07:20,536
For better or worse.

849
01:07:23,456 --> 01:07:24,891
What are they capable of?

850
01:07:24,915 --> 01:07:25,955
You get her there safely,

851
01:07:25,979 --> 01:07:27,884
and they'll give you
what you need.

852
01:07:27,908 --> 01:07:29,813
Not just a battery.
The whole thing.

853
01:07:29,837 --> 01:07:32,442
Fueled-up truck, guns,
supplies, all of it.

854
01:07:32,466 --> 01:07:33,778
I swear.

855
01:07:36,635 --> 01:07:37,970
I swear.

856
01:07:45,770 --> 01:07:46,936
Asshole!

857
01:07:52,860 --> 01:07:54,463
You trust her?

858
01:07:54,487 --> 01:07:56,381
No, me neither,
but she seems desperate.

859
01:07:56,405 --> 01:07:59,176
Firefly vehicle usually means
repurposed FEDRA stuff.

860
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:01,637
So better-than-decent chance
makin' it to Tommy in one of those.

861
01:08:01,661 --> 01:08:03,138
The second we hand
that kid over...

862
01:08:03,162 --> 01:08:04,515
Y'all talk it through,
but please remember

863
01:08:04,539 --> 01:08:06,165
that I'm bleeding out.

864
01:08:10,336 --> 01:08:12,522
Okay. Here's the deal.

865
01:08:12,546 --> 01:08:13,649
We'll get her to your
crew at the State House.

866
01:08:13,673 --> 01:08:15,859
But before we hand her over,

867
01:08:15,883 --> 01:08:17,924
they give us
everything that we want.

868
01:08:17,948 --> 01:08:19,989
If not, we kill her,
there and then.

869
01:08:20,013 --> 01:08:21,907
- Deal.
- Really? That fast?

870
01:08:21,931 --> 01:08:23,825
You are all that matters.

871
01:08:23,849 --> 01:08:25,661
My team will not
jeopardize that.

872
01:08:25,685 --> 01:08:27,830
Remember what I told you?

873
01:08:27,854 --> 01:08:29,999
Now go get your backpack.

874
01:08:30,023 --> 01:08:31,524
Now, Ellie.

875
01:08:41,992 --> 01:08:43,035
Let's go.

876
01:08:51,085 --> 01:08:52,419
Joel...

877
01:08:54,463 --> 01:08:57,508
don't fuck this up.

878
01:08:58,342 --> 01:08:59,426
Please.

879
01:09:50,686 --> 01:09:52,248
Give us a minute, all right?

880
01:09:52,272 --> 01:09:53,397
What the fuck?!

881
01:09:55,149 --> 01:09:57,085
So, what's the plan?

882
01:09:57,109 --> 01:09:59,588
Hm. There's
not a lot of options.

883
01:09:59,612 --> 01:10:02,091
There's the short way
or the long way.

884
01:10:02,115 --> 01:10:03,697
The short way is pretty much...

885
01:10:03,721 --> 01:10:05,302
That leaves the long way.

886
01:10:05,326 --> 01:10:07,137
Things look bad,
we'll come up with something.

887
01:10:07,161 --> 01:10:08,973
We'll have to drop,
head to Bill and Frank's.

888
01:10:08,997 --> 01:10:12,458
Stock up on anything
we may need.

889
01:10:28,057 --> 01:10:30,225
We leave after
dark. Stay with the kid.

890
01:10:32,186 --> 01:10:34,772
Wait. Why do I have to... Tess.

891
01:10:35,564 --> 01:10:36,815
Tess!

892
01:10:44,281 --> 01:10:45,449
So, who's Bill and Frank?

893
01:10:48,243 --> 01:10:50,096
The radio's
a smuggling code, right?

894
01:10:50,120 --> 01:10:51,974
'60s song, they don't
have anything new,

895
01:10:51,998 --> 01:10:54,310
'70s, they got new stuff.

896
01:10:54,334 --> 01:10:55,626
What's '80s?

897
01:11:02,633 --> 01:11:03,902
What are you doing?

898
01:11:03,926 --> 01:11:04,904
- Killin' time.
- Well, what am I supposed to do?

899
01:11:04,928 --> 01:11:07,429
I'm sure you'll figure that out.

900
01:11:15,270 --> 01:11:16,897
Your watch is broken.

901
01:11:30,619 --> 01:11:33,664
You mumble in your sleep.

902
01:11:41,630 --> 01:11:43,430
I've never been on the
other side of the Wall.

903
01:11:45,175 --> 01:11:46,260
Look how dark it is.

904
01:11:53,809 --> 01:11:55,227
You guys go out there a lot?

905
01:11:56,478 --> 01:11:58,290
- I guess.
- When was the last time?

906
01:11:58,314 --> 01:12:00,126
Maybe a year. What's it matter?

907
01:12:00,150 --> 01:12:01,900
But you know where to go.

908
01:12:03,068 --> 01:12:04,695
So we're gonna be okay.

909
01:12:09,491 --> 01:12:12,536
Yeah.

910
01:12:17,750 --> 01:12:18,601
So, what's the deal
with you anyway?

911
01:12:18,625 --> 01:12:20,919
You some kinda bigwig's
daughter or somethin'?

912
01:12:23,297 --> 01:12:24,923
Something like that.

913
01:12:33,474 --> 01:12:35,893
Oh, the radio came on
when you were sleeping.

914
01:12:36,518 --> 01:12:36,911
What?

915
01:12:36,935 --> 01:12:37,871
What was the song?

916
01:12:37,895 --> 01:12:39,956
He kept sayin', like,

917
01:12:39,980 --> 01:12:42,566
like, "Wake me up
before you go-go"?

918
01:12:43,692 --> 01:12:45,796
Shit.

919
01:12:45,820 --> 01:12:47,338
Gotcha.

920
01:12:47,362 --> 01:12:49,531
'80s means trouble.

921
01:12:50,449 --> 01:12:53,494
Code broken.

922
01:12:54,078 --> 01:12:57,081
Listen...

923
01:13:01,877 --> 01:13:04,105
The spot under
Lancaster looks good.

924
01:13:04,129 --> 01:13:06,358
- You got a jacket in your pack?
- Yeah.

925
01:13:06,382 --> 01:13:09,134
Okay, get it. It's time to go.

926
01:13:20,938 --> 01:13:23,062
<i>...mandatory curfew</i>

927
01:13:23,086 --> 01:13:25,234
<i>to fight infection
and insurrection.</i>

928
01:13:28,070 --> 01:13:30,131
<i>Observe mandatory curfew</i>

929
01:13:30,155 --> 01:13:33,325
<i>to fight infection
and insurrection.</i>

930
01:14:22,124 --> 01:14:24,081
Holy shit. I'm actually outside.

931
01:14:24,105 --> 01:14:26,086
- Jesus Christ.
- Oh shit.

932
01:14:29,423 --> 01:14:32,987
Okay, we're gonna take the
left edge around the buffer zone.

933
01:14:33,011 --> 01:14:35,865
You stay close
and you follow my lead.

934
01:14:35,889 --> 01:14:38,367
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

935
01:14:38,391 --> 01:14:40,058
Let's go.

936
01:16:10,732 --> 01:16:11,876
What the hell?

937
01:16:11,900 --> 01:16:13,443
Hey, hey!
Don't, don't, don't move.

938
01:16:15,863 --> 01:16:18,282
Don't move!

939
01:16:22,411 --> 01:16:24,138
You gotta be shittin' me.

940
01:16:24,162 --> 01:16:26,099
- Okay, let's talk this out.
- Turn around.

941
01:16:26,123 --> 01:16:28,477
- Hold on...
- Get on your fuckin' knees. Get on your fuckin' knees!

942
01:16:28,501 --> 01:16:30,104
- Now hold on...
- What did I fuckin' tell you, man?

943
01:16:30,128 --> 01:16:31,814
I said stay the fuck home.

944
01:16:31,838 --> 01:16:33,481
Get on your knees!

945
01:16:33,505 --> 01:16:35,359
Just get on your knees,
just get on your knees.

946
01:16:35,383 --> 01:16:37,590
Listen, you let us
do this run...

947
01:16:37,614 --> 01:16:39,290
we'll split the cards with you.

948
01:16:39,314 --> 01:16:40,990
- Oh, will you?
- Yeah.

949
01:16:41,014 --> 01:16:41,823
I'm so blessed.

950
01:16:41,847 --> 01:16:44,576
Hands on your head.
Eyes forward.

951
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:45,892
Hands on your head!

952
01:16:49,563 --> 01:16:51,940
- Really, man?
- Yep. We're doin' this by the book.

953
01:16:53,233 --> 01:16:54,919
Jesus Christ.

954
01:16:54,943 --> 01:16:56,630
All right.
What about three-quarters?

955
01:16:56,654 --> 01:16:58,215
Unauthorized exit.

956
01:16:58,239 --> 01:17:00,300
They'll hang you for that.

957
01:17:00,324 --> 01:17:01,843
Fine. Everythin'
off of this run,

958
01:17:01,867 --> 01:17:04,221
- and half off on all of the pills.
- Half off?

959
01:17:04,245 --> 01:17:05,472
All off.

960
01:17:05,496 --> 01:17:06,723
Risk my job for half off.

961
01:17:06,747 --> 01:17:08,809
Outta your fuckin' mind...

962
01:17:08,833 --> 01:17:09,851
Ellie, Ellie!

963
01:17:09,875 --> 01:17:12,688
- Ellie, what the...
- Fuckin' bitch!

964
01:17:12,712 --> 01:17:14,564
Fuck!

965
01:17:14,588 --> 01:17:16,757
- Get out of the fuckin' way!
- Whoa, whoa!

966
01:17:18,634 --> 01:17:20,112
We can fix this.

967
01:17:20,136 --> 01:17:21,261
Move.

968
01:17:25,307 --> 01:17:28,352

970
01:18:05,764 --> 01:18:07,451

a day old to you?!

974
01:18:14,981 --> 01:18:17,627

975
01:18:17,651 --> 01:18:20,297
- When did it happen?
- It doesn't matter! You have to trust me!

976
01:18:20,321 --> 01:18:23,634
They're gonna catch us if we don't run!

977
01:18:23,658 --> 01:18:27,119
