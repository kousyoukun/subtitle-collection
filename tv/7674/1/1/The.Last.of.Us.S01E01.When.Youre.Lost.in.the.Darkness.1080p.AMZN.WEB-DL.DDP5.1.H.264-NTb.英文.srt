1
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:10,200
And that's your biggest worry? Yes, any kind of virus,

2
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:12,540
but most probably something similar to influenza.

3
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:13,870
Because of air travel.

4
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:15,630
Through the air. - Coughing--

5
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:18,250
- I'm sorry. I meant people. On planes.

6
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:19,920
That was something you described in your book.

7
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:23,970
Yes, a new virus in Madagascar, say, could be in Chicago within a matter of weeks.

8
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:26,050
And we end up with a global pandemic. Pan meaning "all."

9
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:29,390
The whole world becomes sick all at once.

10
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:33,350
And, Dr. Neuman, you're also an epidemiologist.

11
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,230
I presume the prospect of a viral pandemic keeps you up at night as well.

12
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:37,650
- No. - No?

13
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:40,360
- No. - All right, well, that's our show.

14
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,320
No, mankind has been at war with the virus from the start.

15
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:46,620
Sometimes, millions of people die, as in an actual war.

16
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:49,120
But in the end, we always win.

17
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,370
But you-- just to be clear, you do think microorganisms pose a threat.

18
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:54,460
In the most dire terms.

19
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:56,460
- Bacteria. - No.

20
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:58,590
- You like saying no. - Yes.

21
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,800
Not bacteria. Not viruses. - So?

22
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,220
- Fungus.

23
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:07,050
Yes, that's the usual response.

24
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:09,140
Fungi seem harmless enough.

25
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:11,060
Many species know otherwise.

26
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:14,640
Because there are some fungi who seek not to kill,

27
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:15,770
but to control.

28
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:18,610
Let me ask you, where do we get LSD from?

29
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:20,400
Where do you get it from?

30
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,860
It comes from ergot, a fungus.

31
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:25,200
Psilocybin? Also a fungus.

32
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,200
Viruses can make us ill, but fungi can alter our very minds.

33
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:31,200
There's a fungus that infects insects.

34
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:33,330
Gets inside an ant, for example,

35
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:36,460
travels through its circulatory system to the ant's brain,

36
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:41,800
and then floods it with hallucinogens, thus bending the ant's mind to its will.

37
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,090
The fungus starts to direct the ant's behavior,

38
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:45,630
telling it where to go, what to do,

39
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,840
like a puppeteer with a marionette.

40
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:49,260
And it gets worse.

41
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:50,850
The fungus needs food to live,

42
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:54,270
so it begins to devour its host from within,

43
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:56,850
replacing the ant's flesh with its own,

44
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:59,900
but it doesn't let its victim die.

45
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:03,980
No, it keeps its puppet alive by preventing decomposition.

46
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:05,240
How?

47
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,490
Where do we get penicillin from? Fungus.

48
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:12,160
Dr. Schoenheiss, you're in distress. Fungal infection of this kind is real,

49
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,620
but not in humans.

50
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:17,830
True, fungi cannot survive if its host's internal temperature is over 94 degrees.

51
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,210
And currently,

52
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:21,000
there are no reasons for fungi to evolve

53
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:23,590
to be able to withstand higher temperatures.

54
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:27,590
But what if that were to change? What if, for instance,

55
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,220
the world were to get slightly warmer?

56
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:33,810
Well, now there is reason to evolve.

57
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:35,060
One gene mutates

58
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:38,270
and an ascomycete, candida, ergot,

59
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:39,940
cordyceps, aspergillus,

60
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:43,360
any one of them could become capable of burrowing into our brains

61
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:47,240
and taking control not of millions of us, but billions of us.

62
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,490
Billions of puppets with poisoned minds

63
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:53,450
permanently fixed on one unifying goal:

64
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:57,870
to spread the infection to every last human alive

65
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,370
by any means necessary.

66
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:03,420
And there are no treatments for this. No preventatives, no cures.

67
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:06,960
They don't exist. It's not even possible to make them.

68
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,180
So, if that happens?

69
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:12,260
We lose.

70
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:17,890
We'll be back.

71
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:00,830
Alarm.

72
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,460
Alarm!

73
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:21,350
- Where's the pancake mix?

74
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:22,680
- Oh, was I--

75
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:24,100
Yeah, I was. Sorry.

76
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:27,100
I was gonna make you birthday pancakes. I swear.

77
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:28,980
You know I don't really like pancakes.

78
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:31,610
I know you don't like them. It was for my benefit.

79
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:37,070
Vitamin C.

80
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:47,210
You get your homework done?

81
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:51,050
Fractions?

82
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:55,010
How old are you again?

83
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:56,800
Thirty-six.

84
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,640
Gonna have to wear diapers soon. Who says I don't already?

85
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:04,930
Shell. Calcium.

86
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,190
Lovely.

87
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:09,690
Is there enough for Uncle Tommy?

88
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:11,150
Well, there would've been.

89
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:15,740
You're still alive, you old fucker.

90
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:19,030
He loves you. He's dependent on me. Not the same.

91
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,330
- I think it's the same. - It's definitely the same.

92
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:22,870
I thought we was havin' pancakes.

93
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,160
We'll pick you somethin' up on the road.

94
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:27,330
- Concrete guys gonna be there? - Yeah, they said maybe.

95
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:30,580
Maybe? We can't frame until we pour. We're not gettin' paid until we frame.

96
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:32,840
Well, we could bring someone else on, get the job done faster.

97
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,710
- No, no. I'm not splittin' this job.

98
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,130
I barely wanna split it with you.

99
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:37,340
We could work a double.

100
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:38,510
- Literally?

101
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:40,180
Today? - I know. I'd be done by nine.

102
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:41,510
By nine, right?

103
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:43,100
Yeah.

104
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:45,680
I'll bring back a cake.

105
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:47,180
I promise.

106
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:53,570
...continued disturbances in Jakarta, but are advising U.S. citizens...

107
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:55,780
Jakarta. Where is that, Middle East?

108
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,780
Doesn't ring a bell. It's definitely a country.

109
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:58,950
- Or maybe part of Asia?

110
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:00,110
- Jakarta isn't a country.

111
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,990
Being a part of Asia isn't mutually exclusive with being a country,

112
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,870
and in fact, it's the capital of Indonesia.

113
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:07,330
Shit. Hope for us yet.

114
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:15,380
All right.

115
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,670
Finish up quick, we'll drop you off.

116
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:20,430
- I'm still eating my eggshells. - You got seven minutes.

117
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:22,220
Your t-shirt's inside out.

118
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:26,890
Shit.

119
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:30,350
He's losin' it.

120
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:13,770
Sarah!

121
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,240
Hey, neighbor!

122
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:22,740
Oh, Hi.

123
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:24,780
Connie was askin' after you,

124
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:27,330
since you haven't been over in a while.

125
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:28,790
Make 'em happy.

126
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:33,170
I could come by after school, but just for, like, a little bit?

127
00:08:33,290 --> 00:08:34,670
- She'll take whatcha got.

128
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:37,630
Y'all can bake, whatever.

129
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,090
Speakin' of,

130
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:40,840
we got a lotta extra here.

131
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:42,590
Y'all want some biscuits?

132
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:45,180
Dad, you love biscuits.

133
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:50,890
I do.

134
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:52,640
But I'm on Atkins.

135
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:54,730
- On what now? - It's,

136
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:57,270
you know what? We gotta run, but Sarah'll be by later.

137
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,020
She'll stay as long as you want.

138
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:01,780
Tell ya all about Atkins. Great!

139
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,320
I'll let Connie know.

140
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,320
Solid.

141
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:11,250
Can't tell you how exciting it was listenin' to that fuckin' conversation.

142
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:12,620
Put that out.

143
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:15,120
Happy birthday to you.

144
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:17,840
OPERATION DESERT STORM COMBAT VETERAN

145
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:25,380
AUSTIN, TX SEPTEMBER 26th

146
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:28,550
Want you to write this diagram out exactly as I have it.

147
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,220
Always subject and predicate.

148
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:33,060
Verb and noun.

149
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:35,310
Okay, the sentence is, "Where are you going?"

150
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:37,100
Subject is you.

151
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:39,320
You are going.

152
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:42,860
Predicate. Where, adverb.

153
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:45,200
You see it? Okay. Have some nods, shaking of heads.

154
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,530
I swear you will use this later in life.

155
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,780
Believe me, that's why you're here.

156
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:53,000
Okay? So...

157
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,750
Yes, you need to know this!

158
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:00,670
Yes, it's on your test next week!

159
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:04,800
Homework is due end of class tomorrow!

160
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,980
Twenty.

161
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,270
That's it?

162
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,480
Okay, 30.

163
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,610
Twenty's good.

164
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:08,150
It's a spring. I'll do it right now.

165
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:29,510
All day. I swear.

166
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:34,010
We're closing.

167
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:36,640
We're done for today.

168
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:38,230
It's 3:15, we close at 7.

169
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:44,150
- I'm very sorry. He cannot finish. - I'm already finished.

170
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:49,360
You should go home.

171
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,880
- There you are, sweetie. - Sorry.

172
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:12,430
I was gettin' worried.

173
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:14,430
I was getting something for my dad.

174
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:16,850
Hi, Mercy.

175
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:19,930
Hey, is everything okay?

176
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:21,850
Like, on the news?

177
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:23,480
Like what, hon?

178
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:27,110
Well, no, there was just a lot of police and stuff on the road today.

179
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:29,110
Well, that's true every day, innit?

180
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:31,570
People out there need to get right with Jesus.

181
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:35,910
Three nails, plus one cross, equals four-given.

182
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:38,660
I was thinkin' we'd make some cookies.

183
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:40,120
Chocolate chip?

184
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:42,160
Raisin.

185
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:51,420
C'mon, Mama.

186
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:52,630
It's green.

187
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,050
You love that.

188
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,220
Here we go!

189
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,060
I don't know why I talk to her.

190
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:01,230
She's completely deaf.

191
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:30,960
You wanna give me a hand?

192
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:32,340
Be right there!

193
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:55,910
Hey, Mrs. Adler?

194
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:57,570
Could I borrow this?

195
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,500
Yeah, sure. It's one of Danny's.

196
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:07,330
You know what? My dad's gonna be back real soon. - I should go.

197
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:08,920
- You sure? - Yeah.

198
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,000
- Well, you're takin' some cookies.

199
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:05,470
No comment today from the Austin Police Department regarding a rash of violent incidents across the city,

200
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,850
some suggesting a new street drug may be to blame.

201
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:10,600
More on that when we return,

202
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:14,320
with Manuela Sanchez reporting live...

203
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:21,820
You locked the door for once.

204
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:23,490
Good job.

205
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:24,830
Yeah.

206
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:31,290
- It's 10. - I know.

207
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:34,750
They gave us the wrong size for the headers.

208
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:38,340
That doesn't mean anything to ya. I'm sorry.

209
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:39,840
Where's the cake?

210
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:41,760
- Shit.

211
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,100
- C'mon, man. I'll get us one tomorrow.

212
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:45,220
Swear,

213
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:47,060
or you don't get your present.

214
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:48,480
- You got me a present?

215
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,730
- Swear.

216
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:51,480
On my life.

217
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:00,200
Wow.

218
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:05,370
Fixed it for you.

219
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:13,960
- Did you? - What?

220
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:15,290
I don't hear anything.

221
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:17,670
That was lame.

222
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,670
- You're lame. - Yeah, I know.

223
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:22,970
Where'd you get the money for this?

224
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:26,140
Drugs. I sell hardcore drugs. It's better than what I do.

225
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:29,140
It was only $20, which I stole from you.

226
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:31,390
I could've stolen 60,

227
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,850
but I put the change back because I'm an honest thief.

228
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:35,400
Besides, it's the thought that counts.

229
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,980
And you were never gonna do it for yourself, so.

230
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:44,120
Thank you.

231
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,620
There's one more.

232
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,620
- Borrowed it from the Adlers.

233
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,880
- This is the one with the deleted scenes. Yeah,

234
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,590
imagine how bad those have to be.

235
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:59,340
C'mon, pop it in. While it's still your birthday.

236
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:09,470
- Don't fall asleep.

237
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,770
-'Course, I won't. It's too riveting.

238
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,000
Hello?

239
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,960
Joel, it's me.

240
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,420
I'm okay.

241
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,590
- Yeah? -But I'm in jail.

242
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:43,880
- Goddammit. -Wasn't my fault this time.

243
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:46,890
I was at the bar, some guy goes crazy, starts swingin' at a waitress,

244
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:48,800
I stepped in, knocked him out, cops show up--

245
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:50,970
Look, it doesn't fuckin' matter. -You gotta bail me out.

246
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:52,310
- Now? It's Friday,

247
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:54,640
you don't get me out tonight, I'm in here all weekend.

248
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:57,270
It's a fuckin' madhouse, Joel. -I gotta get out.

249
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:58,940
- Well, which jail? Travis County?

250
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:00,320
Yeah, on 10th.

251
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,030
- Goddammit, Tommy.

252
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:03,240
-I'm sorry.

253
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:05,950
Please.

254
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:08,490
Okay.

255
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:09,950
Fuckin' idiot.

256
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:35,380
11:03 PM

257
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,890
Dad?

258
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:24,150
Dad?!

259
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:42,920
...indoors.

260
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,130
Law enforcement and emergency services are in the area

261
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:48,590
and will be in contact with further instructions.

262
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:51,840
Stay indoors,

263
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:53,430
law enforcement...

264
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:02,730
Easy. Easy, Mercy.

265
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:04,730
What're you doing out here, boy?

266
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:34,260
C'mon, let's get you home.

267
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:39,980
C'mon, Mercy. Please.

268
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:41,640
Mercy!

269
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:54,200
Mrs. Adler?

270
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:16,260
Mrs. Adler?

271
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,000
Mrs. Adler?

272
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:02,810
Help me.

273
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:55,150
Get in the truck! Right now!

274
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,740
Move!

275
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:10,080
What are we doin', Joel?

276
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:28,310
- You killed her. - Baby, I'm sorry.

277
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:30,150
- Joel, we gotta go. - Sarah, listen to me.

278
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:31,860
It's not just the Adlers.

279
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:34,780
But we're gonna be brave, and we're gonna get outta this.

280
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,280
Hey. Let's go. Come on.

281
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:39,160
Get in.

282
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:41,870
Joel?

283
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:43,990
Denise, you get back inside the house!

284
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,830
- You lock your doors! Now!

285
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:47,540
- C'mon, c'mon, get in!

286
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:58,670
- Get your seat belt on. - Hold on.

287
00:24:01,930 --> 00:24:03,510
Jesus Christ, Joel!

288
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:10,100
- You take 70-- - 71, I know.

289
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:12,860
AUSTIN SAN MARCOS

290
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:20,200
- Daddy-- - We don't know.

291
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:22,490
They're saying it's a virus. Some kind of parasite.

292
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:24,160
Is it from terrorists?

293
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,450
We don't know.

294
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:29,160
- Are we sick? - No. Of course not.

295
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:32,500
Why did things blow up? No cellphone, no radio.

296
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:34,250
Minute ago, newsman wouldn't shut up.

297
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:35,880
- How do you know? - What?

298
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:38,380
How do you know we're not sick?

299
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:41,090
They're saying it's mostly people in the city.

300
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:43,090
That's why they got the highway blocked off.

301
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,100
God.

302
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:49,850
It's Jimmy's place.

303
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:01,240
The Adlers would take Nana into the city.

304
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:03,110
To the hospital for stuff.

305
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,740
That's right. They would.

306
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:06,330
That's probably why.

307
00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:11,410
But, you'd have to go a lot,

308
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:12,670
right?

309
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:14,330
We're fine. Trust me.

310
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:18,880
All right.

311
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:27,010
Here! Right here!

312
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:28,510
- Hey! - What are you doin'? - Got a kid, Joel.

313
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,390
- So do we. Keep driving.

314
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:31,980
We could put them in the back.

315
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,610
Somebody else'll come along.

316
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,950
Fuck! Everybody had the same fuckin' idea.

317
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,830
I can't get through this. All right. Let's think it through, we'll think it through.

318
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,250
- Fuck! - All right, take the field.

319
00:25:56,330 --> 00:25:58,250
We cut across and we pick up on the west side.

320
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:01,090
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. West, west, all right. All right, hang on.

321
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:16,850
Shit! Fuckin' army.

322
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:18,190
- Isn't that good?

323
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:20,940
- It's good for them, but that's the highway we're tryin' to get to.

324
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:23,400
All right, keep movin'. Head north. - Could be a lotta people.

325
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:25,700
- Well, we can't go south, we can't go east, we can't go west.

326
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:27,280
Hell else we supposed to go?

327
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:29,870
Tommy, come on!

328
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:36,370
Yeah.

329
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:39,000
Yeah, I know that place. - This can work. - Yeah, but then what?

330
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:43,130
I don't know. Mexico. Just far, far as we can. - How much gas?

331
00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:44,840
- Three-quarter tank.

332
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:47,680
Go through town, golf course by the river, straight across,

333
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:51,260
we pick up the highway on the other side of the blockade, then we're out.

334
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:01,730
Maybe it's everywhere.

335
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,990
Maybe there's nowhere to go.

336
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,990
What the fuck?!

337
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:26,420
Son of a bitch. Gotta go around.

338
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:27,760
Grab somethin'!

339
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,820
All right, keep goin', keep goin'.

340
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:46,280
Shit. Tommy!

341
00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:52,240
Tommy, you can't stop here.

342
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,620
- I can't drive through 'em all. - Are you serious?

343
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:55,830
Just keep goin'!

344
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:03,340
Go, go, go. Back, back, back, back, back, back, back! - I'm trying!

345
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:10,840
Tommy, go faster! We gotta go! I'm tryin'! There's nowhere to fuckin' go!

346
00:28:10,930 --> 00:28:12,930
- Find an alley! - What alley? - There's people everywhere!

347
00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:15,350
- Roll the fuck over them! We gotta get off this street now!

348
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:16,720
That's what I'm tryin' to do, Joel.

349
00:28:16,810 --> 00:28:18,480
We're gonna be okay. Just keep drivin'.

350
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,850
Dad?

351
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:22,610
Holy shit!

352
00:28:22,690 --> 00:28:24,940
Move. Move!

353
00:28:57,100 --> 00:29:00,810
Sarah, Sarah. Stay right there. Don't move.

354
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:05,230
Tommy, you okay? Yeah, I'm okay.

355
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:20,790
Sarah, don't look.

356
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:22,710
You look at me, okay?

357
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:24,540
I'm sorry, baby, I know, I know. Come here. Put your arms around me.

358
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:27,040
Come here, come here.

359
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:30,510
I got you. I got you.

360
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,130
Got you.

361
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:36,350
Are you okay? Are you okay?

362
00:29:36,430 --> 00:29:38,260
- My ankle. - All right, okay.

363
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:39,640
We gotta get off the street!

364
00:29:39,770 --> 00:29:41,020
Shit!

365
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:46,440
Tommy?!

366
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,690
Tommy?

367
00:29:47,770 --> 00:29:49,360
Tommy!

368
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:52,990
Head to the river! I'll find a way.

369
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:55,280
Get her outta here, Joel! Go!

370
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:59,490
- We can't leave him. - He'll be fine. - Can you run?

371
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:00,830
- No.

372
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:03,620
- You keep your eyes on me. - Okay.

373
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:05,330
- Okay? - Okay. And don't look anywhere else.

374
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:07,040
Alright.

375
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:07,230
It's okay, baby. You're safe.

376
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:09,060
Don't move!

377
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:13,400
- My daughter's hurt. Her ankle. - Stop right there!

378
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:16,070
Okay.

379
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:19,120
Easy now. We're not sick!

380
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:22,740
I got two civilians by the river, one of 'em injured.

381
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:24,950
Ankle.

382
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:27,210
What about Uncle Tommy?

383
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:29,500
We're gonna get you somewhere safe first.

384
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:31,290
Then we'll go back for him, okay? - Okay.

385
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:32,960
- Okay.  I'm sorry, repeat?

386
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,720
Hey! No one told you to move.

387
00:31:37,090 --> 00:31:38,260
Yes, sir.

388
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:41,220
Yes, sir.

389
00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:45,470
Yes, sir.

390
00:31:49,770 --> 00:31:50,980
We're not sick.

391
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:54,900
Sir,

392
00:31:55,690 --> 00:31:56,900
we are not sick!

393
00:32:10,290 --> 00:32:11,420
I'm sorry.

394
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,050
Please, don't.

395
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,260
Oh God.

396
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:31,400
No. Oh no.

397
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:33,770
No, no. No.

398
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:36,940
Okay, You're okay.

399
00:32:37,570 --> 00:32:39,240
You're okay. Move your hand, baby.

400
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:40,610
Move your hand.

401
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:49,250
I know, baby, I know, I know, I know, I know.

402
00:32:49,330 --> 00:32:50,710
I know it hurts.

403
00:32:51,370 --> 00:32:53,670
Alright. Don't look down, look up, look up.

404
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:56,710
Come on, baby. You're okay, you're okay.

405
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,800
I know, I know, I know, I know, baby, I know, I know.

406
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,880
I know this hurts.

407
00:33:00,970 --> 00:33:03,180
You're gonna be okay.

408
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:05,970
All right, baby, baby, baby, listen to me.

409
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:07,850
I gotta get you up, okay?

410
00:33:07,930 --> 00:33:10,560
I gotta get you up. All right?

411
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,400
You come on. You come on.

412
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:13,730
I know, baby.

413
00:33:13,810 --> 00:33:16,360
No, no. I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know.

414
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:17,940
Tommy, help me!

415
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:20,150
Joel.

416
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:24,990
C'mon, baby girl. C'mon, baby girl, I gotta get you up. Come on.

417
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:28,040
Come on, we'll get up. Come on, baby girl.

418
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,540
Come on,

419
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:32,750
come-- Please.

420
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:55,230
TWENTY YEARS LATER

421
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:48,160
BOSTON

422
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:04,170
WELCOME

423
00:36:17,830 --> 00:36:19,460
We don't want you falling out of the chair.

424
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:21,880
What's your name?

425
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,300
Are you alone?

426
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:32,470
And,

427
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:35,770
how did you get this?

428
00:36:38,850 --> 00:36:41,690
There's gonna be a little tickle right here.

429
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:53,620
What if I told you that after we gave you some medicine,

430
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:56,240
we're gonna find you your favorite food to eat.

431
00:36:56,330 --> 00:36:57,750
Would you like that?

432
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:01,670
And then we'll get you some new clothes... and toys.

433
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:04,210
As many as you wanna play with.

434
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,420
It's just a little needle.

435
00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:13,800
It's okay.

436
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:19,600
You're safe.

437
00:38:24,210 --> 00:38:25,460
I can't.

438
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,500
Ten.

439
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:19,100
- You got anything else?

440
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:21,760
- Nothin' today. Tomorrow, we got street sweeping,

441
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:24,600
or sewer maintenance.

442
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:26,440
Which pays more?

443
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:28,060
That'd be the one with the shit.

444
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:34,320
Late crew. 4 P.M. start.

445
00:39:43,870 --> 00:39:45,080
CURFEW HOURS 6PM - 6AM

446
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:46,250
ANYONE ON THE STREET WITHOUT FEDERAL APPROVAL IS SUBJECT TO IMMEDIATE ARREST

447
00:39:54,510 --> 00:39:57,050
SHOE LACES 1 RATION CARD EACH BOOT LACES 2 RATION CARDS EACH SEARCH FOR THE LIGHT

452
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:28,710
Each of you have been tried in a military court of justice,

453
00:40:28,790 --> 00:40:32,960
and each of you having been found guilty by the court martial panel,

as empowered under the EMPA, Article 1, Section 5...

456
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:56,400
C'mon.

457
00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:05,160
Or I could just shoot you. Yeah, but then what would you do?

458
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:08,450
You're short five.

459
00:41:28,970 --> 00:41:30,850
- Oxy? - Hydro.

460
00:41:31,770 --> 00:41:33,190
- How old? - Three months.

- From Atlanta? - I don't know where he gets 'em from.

462
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,610
I just know they're real. If it's real, it's from Atlanta.

463
00:41:37,690 --> 00:41:39,990
FEDRA's got a factory down there in the QZ.

464
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:42,280
Supposedly only makes two things.

465
00:41:43,990 --> 00:41:46,280
Pills and bullets, bullets and pills.

466
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:49,120
Well, the more you shoot people, the harder it is to sleep, I guess.

467
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:51,040
You guess?

468
00:41:51,870 --> 00:41:52,960
You want 'em or not?

469
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:00,300
I need the bag back.

470
00:42:04,590 --> 00:42:06,430
- How we doin' with the vehicle? - All set.

471
00:42:06,550 --> 00:42:09,010
Just had to get one last guy in the depot to buy in.

472
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:10,180
Okay, how much?

473
00:42:10,270 --> 00:42:13,770
Four of them on that shift plus me... six hundred total.

474
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:17,480
Look, those trucks are shitheaped for a reason.

475
00:42:17,610 --> 00:42:19,690
And they don't have any batteries. I know.

476
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:23,030
I can see about 200 for the other guys... two hundred for you.

477
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:26,320
Deal.

478
00:42:27,910 --> 00:42:29,700
Hey, do yourself a favor,

479
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:32,540
stay off the streets for the next few nights.

480
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:35,670
Fuckin' Fireflies been blowin' shit up all week.

481
00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:39,050
Two of our guys got shot this morning. Boss has got us working doubles.

482
00:42:39,130 --> 00:42:40,840
Guys are jumpy and tired.

483
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:43,630
It's easy to make a mistake in the dark.

484
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:48,010
Stay safe.

485
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:50,220
Yeah, you too.

486
00:42:58,860 --> 00:43:03,490
WHEN YOU'RE LOST IN THE DARKNESS LOOK FOR THE LIGHT

487
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:12,750
What do you want me to say, Tess?

488
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:15,580
I'm not askin' you to say anything.

489
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:18,790
Sure.

490
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:24,170
It's not like I planned

491
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:26,720
on rippin' you off.

492
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,300
I'm sorry.

493
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:30,470
Well,

494
00:43:32,310 --> 00:43:34,390
how about we just let it go?

495
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:43,730
What else are you gonna do?

496
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:46,070
Ya gonna keep me here? - Kill me?

497
00:43:46,150 --> 00:43:49,870
- Tess, c'mon. Then, Robert, what do ya want?

498
00:43:49,950 --> 00:43:52,790
I want you to forget this ever happened. Done.

499
00:43:52,870 --> 00:43:55,870
- Don't do that. - What? It's just a truck battery.

500
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:58,750
I paid you for it, you sold it to someone else, and you spent my money.

501
00:43:58,830 --> 00:44:00,380
I mean, you think I've never done shit like that?

502
00:44:00,460 --> 00:44:02,710
- My guys fucked you up. - Yeah, so discipline them.

503
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:05,010
You cut off a finger or whatever the fuck you want.

504
00:44:05,090 --> 00:44:07,090
I don't care. They're your fuckin' guys.

505
00:44:07,590 --> 00:44:08,720
What about your guy?

506
00:44:09,430 --> 00:44:11,640
'Cause when he sees you, - I mean, put yourself in my shoes.

507
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:13,260
- Look, he answers to me.

508
00:44:13,970 --> 00:44:17,390
So, I give you my word that he won't hurt you.

509
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:21,190
I'll tell him that I got jumped by some guys,

510
00:44:21,270 --> 00:44:24,480
and then you and I can just move the fuck on.

511
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:30,030
Now your shit has pretty much ruined my week,

512
00:44:30,110 --> 00:44:34,120
and I'd like to go home and drink 'til my face stops hurting.

513
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:35,870
So, are we good?

514
00:44:41,540 --> 00:44:43,000
Yeah.

515
00:44:56,680 --> 00:45:00,560
All citizens must clear the surrounding area immediately.

516
00:45:00,690 --> 00:45:04,110
Do not return until FEDRA authorities permit.

517
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:12,030
All citizens must clear the surrounding area immediately.

518
00:45:12,110 --> 00:45:15,830
Do not return until FEDRA authorities permit.

519
00:45:17,290 --> 00:45:21,290
All citizens must clear the surrounding area immediately.

520
00:45:21,370 --> 00:45:24,960
Do not return until FEDRA authorities permit.

521
00:45:27,510 --> 00:45:31,430
All citizens must clear the surrounding area immediately.

522
00:45:31,510 --> 00:45:34,720
Do not return until FEDRA authorities permit.

523
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:41,600
All citizens must clear the surrounding area immediately.

524
00:45:41,690 --> 00:45:45,230
Do not return until FEDRA authorities permit.

525
00:45:45,310 --> 00:45:46,570
Oh shit.

526
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:49,070
Firefly, up top!

527
00:45:49,940 --> 00:45:52,070
Free Boston now, motherfuckers!

528
00:46:03,580 --> 00:46:06,380
- They're shooting. They're shooting at us. - On your knees. - On your knees!

529
00:46:06,460 --> 00:46:07,710
- No, no! I'm not a F--

530
00:46:11,470 --> 00:46:13,930
I'm not a Firefly!

531
00:46:44,750 --> 00:46:47,130
Count slowly and clearly from one to 10. - One, two, three, four--

532
00:46:47,210 --> 00:46:49,050
- Slowly, and clearly.

533
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:51,960
One.

534
00:46:52,550 --> 00:46:53,590
Two.

535
00:46:54,340 --> 00:46:55,630
Three.

536
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:56,760
Four.

537
00:46:57,340 --> 00:46:58,470
Five.

538
00:46:58,600 --> 00:46:59,890
Six.

539
00:47:00,010 --> 00:47:01,060
Seven.

540
00:47:01,180 --> 00:47:02,680
Eight.

541
00:47:02,810 --> 00:47:05,060
Fuck... you.

542
00:47:07,690 --> 00:47:08,900
And hold out your--

543
00:47:10,730 --> 00:47:13,110
- State your name, slowly and clearly. - Veronica.

544
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:16,950
Same as yesterday, and the day before,

545
00:47:17,030 --> 00:47:19,740
and the day before, and the--

546
00:47:19,830 --> 00:47:23,500
Hey, people are gonna come looking for me. People from FEDRA. You hear me?

547
00:47:23,580 --> 00:47:26,250
Let me out or you're gonna pay, motherfuckers!

548
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:30,710
I'm not supposed to be here!

549
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:41,010
WHEN YOU'RE LOST IN THE DARKNESS

550
00:48:04,830 --> 00:48:06,290
Hey, there's a line!

551
00:48:06,410 --> 00:48:08,080
"Tell Dad it's a girl.

552
00:48:08,750 --> 00:48:10,840
"That would be good, right?

553
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:14,800
"He wanted a granddaughter. Love, Becca."

554
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:16,630
End message. Read back.

555
00:48:21,220 --> 00:48:23,560
Correct, 73-K Orlando. Out.

556
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:43,450
Nothin'?

557
00:48:45,660 --> 00:48:48,830
Is there any chance it's comin' in at night? You're sleepin', you miss it?

558
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:56,960
When I'm sleeping, Gabriela listens, or my son.

559
00:48:57,050 --> 00:48:59,430
The smart one, not the other one, God bless him.

560
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:02,510
If Tommy responded, we'd know.

561
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:04,220
- And you're talkin' to the tower?

562
00:49:04,310 --> 00:49:07,770
- Every day. They gave him your message, they haven't seen or heard from him since,

563
00:49:07,850 --> 00:49:09,100
and that's it.

564
00:49:09,850 --> 00:49:12,060
- It hasn't been that long. - It's been three weeks.

565
00:49:12,150 --> 00:49:14,190
It's never taken him more than a day to respond.

566
00:49:16,150 --> 00:49:17,360
I'm sure he's okay.

567
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:25,120
Show me where the tower is.

568
00:49:25,990 --> 00:49:27,620
You can't be serious.

569
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,290
Joel, it's in Wyoming.

570
00:49:32,170 --> 00:49:34,590
All this open country?

571
00:49:34,670 --> 00:49:38,340
I mean, you're a capable guy, but there are worse things than Infected out there.

572
00:49:38,420 --> 00:49:42,220
I hear everything on this. There are raiders, there are slavers--

573
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:44,300
But you're "sure" Tommy's okay?

574
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:56,020
It's the Cody tower... Q-Bar 4,

575
00:49:56,150 --> 00:49:58,480
but I don't know exactly wh--

576
00:50:03,990 --> 00:50:05,160
Next!

577
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:49,390
You know what, Joel...

578
00:51:50,850 --> 00:51:52,890
Joel!

579
00:52:49,780 --> 00:52:52,200
I got jumped by a couple guys.

580
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:54,540
- What guys? - Just a couple teenagers.

581
00:52:54,620 --> 00:52:57,370
Said some shit, probably shouldn't've.

582
00:52:58,370 --> 00:53:00,880
Come on. You know these guys were born after the outbreak.

583
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:03,460
Never learned how to argue. They just start swingin'.

584
00:53:03,540 --> 00:53:05,500
Fuckin' 19-year-old pieces of shit.

585
00:53:06,670 --> 00:53:09,090
It's a miracle you're alive.

586
00:53:09,180 --> 00:53:10,970
It's a miracle any of us are alive.

587
00:53:13,390 --> 00:53:14,760
These aren't new.

588
00:53:14,850 --> 00:53:16,180
No.

589
00:53:17,140 --> 00:53:19,890
I was in FEDRA lockup all day.

590
00:53:21,230 --> 00:53:22,900
Anyway, it doesn't matter.

591
00:53:23,810 --> 00:53:25,940
- I need you to take a breath. - What?

592
00:53:28,530 --> 00:53:29,990
- Joel-- - What?

593
00:53:31,820 --> 00:53:34,280
The guys who jumped me were with Robert.

594
00:53:34,370 --> 00:53:36,370
He sold our battery to someone else.

595
00:53:37,790 --> 00:53:40,870
Nothing's lost. Shit like this is gonna happen.

596
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:42,670
Now we just shake it off,

597
00:53:42,750 --> 00:53:45,250
and we go get our cards back, or the battery.

598
00:53:45,340 --> 00:53:49,130
I need the battery, Tess. Truck's no good without one,

599
00:53:49,220 --> 00:53:51,340
and if I don't get to Tommy soon, he's gonna die out there.

600
00:53:51,430 --> 00:53:54,010
Okay, fuck it. We get our money back and the battery.

601
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:57,430
But, Joel, listen, Robert is terrified of you.

602
00:53:57,520 --> 00:54:01,060
So, you march outta here all Clint Eastwood, he's gonna get wind of it and skip.

603
00:54:01,140 --> 00:54:03,810
I need you to take a breath.

604
00:54:09,030 --> 00:54:10,860
- Who'd he sell it to? - Don't know.

605
00:54:10,950 --> 00:54:13,450
- Well, where is he? - Don't know.

606
00:54:13,530 --> 00:54:14,870
Yet.

607
00:54:15,740 --> 00:54:18,490
But we're gonna find out, quietly.

608
00:54:18,580 --> 00:54:20,040
Understand?

609
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:24,170
Now I promised Robert that you wouldn't hurt him.

610
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:28,250
But I would very much like for you to hurt him.

611
00:54:28,340 --> 00:54:31,170
So let's go hunt that motherfucker down,

612
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:33,840
and get our battery and our truck,

613
00:54:33,930 --> 00:54:37,220
and then we'll go find Tommy. All right?

614
00:54:40,270 --> 00:54:41,350
All right.

615
00:55:04,790 --> 00:55:06,710
The team in place at Southeast 3?

616
00:55:08,130 --> 00:55:09,710
I held them back.

617
00:55:10,420 --> 00:55:12,050
I have some questions.

618
00:55:13,050 --> 00:55:14,510
Okay.

619
00:55:15,220 --> 00:55:19,720
We've been blowing up meaningless FEDRA targets spread out all over the QZ, for two weeks.

620
00:55:19,810 --> 00:55:21,850
We've already lost four people, and we're--

621
00:55:22,980 --> 00:55:24,100
What's the point of this?

622
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:27,310
Is that your question?

623
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:29,070
That's one of them.

624
00:55:29,150 --> 00:55:30,690
My answer is to follow fuckin' orders.

625
00:55:31,530 --> 00:55:33,440
And why do you have some random girl locked in a room?

626
00:55:33,530 --> 00:55:36,070
And the guys you have guarding her won't tell me shit?

627
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:39,910
Our people are asking what's going on, and I don't know what to tell them.

628
00:55:39,990 --> 00:55:42,120
Tell them to follow fuckin' orders.

629
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:44,540
You two, go to Southeast 3. Now.

630
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:52,510
- Kim. - Marlene.

631
00:55:52,590 --> 00:55:55,130
We are in a war against a military dictatorship

632
00:55:55,220 --> 00:55:58,050
to restore democracy and freedom. Does that sound about right?

633
00:55:58,140 --> 00:56:00,350
- Yes? - Are we winning? Are we beating FEDRA here?

634
00:56:00,430 --> 00:56:03,270
Are the Fireflies beating FEDRA anywhere? - Rebellion takes time.

635
00:56:03,350 --> 00:56:05,600
- You fight for 20 years and you get nowhere, you're not a rebellion.

636
00:56:06,100 --> 00:56:07,850
Just spray paint.

637
00:56:08,850 --> 00:56:11,360
We're not hitting FEDRA "all over" the QZ.

638
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:14,990
We hit 'em here, here, here, here, here.

639
00:56:15,530 --> 00:56:16,900
Where are we right now?

640
00:56:18,820 --> 00:56:20,660
I want FEDRA everywhere but here.

641
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:23,240
I want them as distracted as possible

642
00:56:23,330 --> 00:56:26,620
because tonight, every Firefly in Boston is gonna gather in this building,

643
00:56:26,710 --> 00:56:28,870
and we are gonna leave the QZ. Permanently.

644
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:31,210
- We're quitting?

645
00:56:31,290 --> 00:56:34,960
- No. We're taking that random girl locked in that room west.

646
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:39,050
From our guy in the radio tower in Salem.

647
00:56:47,690 --> 00:56:49,150
Is this real?

648
00:56:49,770 --> 00:56:51,110
I believe it is.

649
00:56:54,820 --> 00:56:56,110
Keep it quiet.

650
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:02,700
Whatever you need. Whatever it takes.

651
00:57:02,780 --> 00:57:04,790
We'll get her where she needs to go.

652
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:35,190
Hey, friend.

653
00:57:36,940 --> 00:57:38,440
Don't worry. I don't want anything.

654
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:40,910
But if you're feelin' lost--

655
00:57:40,990 --> 00:57:44,030
You tell me to "look for the light" and I'll break your jaw.

656
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:57,880
Well, it cost us a couple of cards, but we got him.

657
00:57:57,960 --> 00:58:01,550
He's supposedly takin' the battery to a red-tagged building.

658
00:58:01,630 --> 00:58:04,550
But get this, corner of Stillman and Cross.

659
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:06,310
The one Miguel used to use.

660
00:58:06,390 --> 00:58:08,100
Yeah, I'm thinkin' so.

661
00:58:08,180 --> 00:58:10,230
We can take the subway tunnel under Haymarket,

662
00:58:10,310 --> 00:58:13,310
get into the building from below, and take Robert by surprise.

663
00:58:13,850 --> 00:58:15,520
Pay this fucker back.

664
00:58:23,490 --> 00:58:24,870
Oh, my God.

665
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,960
Agh! You fucker!

666
00:58:38,500 --> 00:58:40,340
One, two, three, four--

667
00:59:08,830 --> 00:59:09,990
You're not scared.

668
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:14,250
Then unlock me.

669
00:59:14,870 --> 00:59:16,580
How about we start with "thank you"?

670
00:59:16,670 --> 00:59:17,840
For what?

671
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:19,590
For saving your life?

672
00:59:19,670 --> 00:59:21,960
I am the one who told 'em not to shoot you, if you recall.

673
00:59:22,050 --> 00:59:23,510
- Yeah.

674
00:59:30,430 --> 00:59:31,600
Why did you stop them?

675
00:59:32,810 --> 00:59:34,310
We'll get to that.

676
00:59:47,950 --> 00:59:50,330
So, Veronica,

677
00:59:52,620 --> 00:59:53,870
how ya feelin'?

678
00:59:55,750 --> 00:59:57,170
The same.

679
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:00,380
Is it gonna happen?

680
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:04,050
No.

681
01:00:07,050 --> 01:00:08,300
So, can I go?

682
01:00:09,180 --> 01:00:10,300
No.

683
01:00:10,390 --> 01:00:13,310
I won't tell anyone about any of this. I swear.

684
01:00:13,390 --> 01:00:16,230
Where you gonna go? Back to FEDRA military school?

685
01:00:16,310 --> 01:00:17,600
- You that anxious to be a soldier?

686
01:00:17,690 --> 01:00:19,440
- You think I chose that place?

687
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:21,360
They put me there when I was a baby.

688
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:22,610
It's for orphans.

689
01:00:22,690 --> 01:00:24,570
"They" didn't put you there.

690
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:27,610
I did.

691
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:29,570
Ellie.

692
01:00:33,450 --> 01:00:34,950
You my fucking mom or something?

693
01:00:35,580 --> 01:00:37,540
Do I look like your mom?

694
01:00:38,250 --> 01:00:40,080
Nooo, you do not.

695
01:00:41,210 --> 01:00:42,920
My name is Marlene.

696
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,130
I'm the leader of the Fireflies in the Boston QZ.

697
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:48,470
Why would a terrorist dump me with FEDRA?

698
01:00:48,550 --> 01:00:50,050
Because it's where you'd be safest,

699
01:00:50,140 --> 01:00:52,220
and you were safe there until you decided to sneak out.

700
01:00:52,300 --> 01:00:54,220
And "terrorist"?

701
01:00:54,310 --> 01:00:56,140
Was Riley a terrorist?

702
01:01:12,410 --> 01:01:14,290
Why won't you let me go home?

703
01:01:18,250 --> 01:01:21,500
Because you have a greater purpose than any of us could've ever imagined.

704
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:25,590
So we're leaving tonight, and we're taking you with us.

705
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:30,470
- He's here. - Five minutes.

706
01:01:35,430 --> 01:01:38,560
What I'm about to tell you cannot be repeated to anyone.

707
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:40,480
Because if you do,

708
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:42,100
I assure you

709
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:44,900
you will die.

710
01:02:07,340 --> 01:02:08,460
Okay.

711
01:02:09,380 --> 01:02:11,760
Ready? Yeah.

712
01:02:29,610 --> 01:02:30,740
That's the one.

713
01:02:55,930 --> 01:02:56,970
Oh fuck.

714
01:02:57,050 --> 01:02:58,100
Oh shit.

715
01:03:00,100 --> 01:03:01,180
This one's done.

716
01:03:03,560 --> 01:03:05,900
Yeah. I know.

717
01:03:05,980 --> 01:03:08,070
I just-- I wasn't expecting it.

718
01:03:08,150 --> 01:03:09,820
Take it he wasn't down here last time?

719
01:03:10,820 --> 01:03:12,150
No.

720
01:03:14,530 --> 01:03:16,530
You think he came down after he was infected?

721
01:03:18,410 --> 01:03:21,410
Well, maybe down here is where he was infected.

722
01:03:25,620 --> 01:03:27,040
Let's keep movin'.

723
01:03:41,470 --> 01:03:43,680
It's like they reframed the whole structure.

724
01:03:43,770 --> 01:03:45,440
Probably in the '80s.

725
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:48,690
Everyone was cutting down on apartment sizes to sell more condos.

726
01:03:48,770 --> 01:03:53,900
"This has been 'Construction Corner' with Joel Miller."

727
01:03:53,990 --> 01:03:56,030
How far up we goin'?

728
01:03:57,910 --> 01:03:59,200
This far.

729
01:04:01,830 --> 01:04:05,620
So, this opens into the hallway.

730
01:04:06,620 --> 01:04:09,630
What the fuck? Someone put a piano in front of this?

731
01:04:12,590 --> 01:04:14,090
You smell that?

732
01:04:15,880 --> 01:04:18,010
Yeah, gunpowder.

733
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:25,850
Tess.

734
01:04:46,870 --> 01:04:48,290
Well, the battery's no good.

735
01:04:49,040 --> 01:04:51,130
And he still tried to sell it.

736
01:04:51,750 --> 01:04:53,090
Twice.

737
01:04:53,630 --> 01:04:55,670
You greedy fuck.

738
01:05:08,520 --> 01:05:10,810
Shit.

739
01:05:10,900 --> 01:05:13,110
Oh God.

740
01:05:15,690 --> 01:05:17,150
Shit, come on.

741
01:05:24,330 --> 01:05:25,620
Fuck.

742
01:05:27,870 --> 01:05:29,080
Joel?

743
01:05:30,170 --> 01:05:31,250
Marlene?

744
01:05:33,290 --> 01:05:35,090
- You okay? - Yeah.

745
01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:40,970
Ellie. Ellie!

746
01:05:42,800 --> 01:05:45,720
- Oh shit! - No, it's okay. I'll be all right.

747
01:05:45,810 --> 01:05:47,810
And you can't be stupid like this.

748
01:05:49,100 --> 01:05:51,730
So this is who Robert screwed us over with?

749
01:05:51,810 --> 01:05:53,690
The Che Guevara of Boston?

750
01:05:53,770 --> 01:05:56,940
War must be goin' pretty shitty for you to be buying from scumbags like him.

751
01:05:57,030 --> 01:05:58,360
Yeah, it kinda has been.

752
01:05:58,440 --> 01:06:01,280
The merch was bad, and he obviously didn't take "fuck off" for an answer.

753
01:06:01,360 --> 01:06:04,080
- Gimme my knife. - What do you need a car battery for?

754
01:06:04,490 --> 01:06:06,080
- Don't. - Not at her.

755
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:09,620
Point it at me.

756
01:06:22,890 --> 01:06:25,220
And to answer your question, I need it for a better reason than you do.

757
01:06:25,300 --> 01:06:27,140
No offense, but Tommy's just one man.

758
01:06:28,270 --> 01:06:30,520
- It's our business to know things. -"To know things."

759
01:06:31,190 --> 01:06:33,600
You're the cause of it. You turned my own brother against me.

760
01:06:33,690 --> 01:06:35,230
- Okay, Joel. - That was a lot of gunfire.

761
01:06:35,310 --> 01:06:37,270
- FEDRA's gonna be on the way. - I know.

762
01:06:42,150 --> 01:06:43,820
We were gonna move Ellie outta the zone tonight.

763
01:06:44,570 --> 01:06:47,280
But we won't make it anywhere like this. Not for a while anyway.

764
01:06:47,370 --> 01:06:49,120
So now I'm thinkin',

765
01:06:49,790 --> 01:06:51,250
you're gonna do it. - The hell we are.

766
01:06:51,330 --> 01:06:52,670
- I'm not goin' with them! - Let me take her.

767
01:06:52,750 --> 01:06:55,000
- Tess, we don't have time for this. You don't have time?

768
01:06:55,080 --> 01:06:56,670
- Who is she? - To you? She's cargo.

769
01:06:56,750 --> 01:06:58,000
We don't smuggle people.

770
01:06:58,090 --> 01:06:59,130
Sorry. - I can do it.

771
01:06:59,210 --> 01:07:02,220
- Kim, you don't have a fuckin' ear on your fuckin' head. Could you please?

772
01:07:03,470 --> 01:07:06,300
There's a team of Fireflies waiting for her at the old State House.

773
01:07:06,390 --> 01:07:08,180
I know what's out there.

774
01:07:08,260 --> 01:07:11,140
We were going with an entire squadron for that very reason.

775
01:07:11,230 --> 01:07:13,270
But now I don't have a truck, I don't have a squadron,

776
01:07:13,350 --> 01:07:16,270
FEDRA's five minutes away. What I do have is you.

777
01:07:16,360 --> 01:07:18,440
And I know what you're both capable of.

778
01:07:19,020 --> 01:07:20,570
For better or worse.

779
01:07:23,530 --> 01:07:25,030
What are they capable of?

780
01:07:25,110 --> 01:07:27,870
You get her there safely, and they'll give you what you need.

781
01:07:27,950 --> 01:07:29,870
Not just a battery. The whole thing.

782
01:07:29,950 --> 01:07:34,000
Fueled-up truck, guns, supplies, all of it. I swear.

783
01:07:36,630 --> 01:07:37,960
I swear.

784
01:07:45,840 --> 01:07:46,930
Asshole!

785
01:07:52,810 --> 01:07:54,310
You trust her?

786
01:07:54,390 --> 01:07:56,440
No, me neither, but she seems desperate.

787
01:07:56,520 --> 01:07:58,980
Firefly vehicle usually means repurposed FEDRA stuff.

788
01:07:59,070 --> 01:08:01,610
So better-than-decent chance makin' it to Tommy in one of those.

789
01:08:01,690 --> 01:08:03,240
The second we hand that kid over--

790
01:08:03,320 --> 01:08:06,240
Y'all talk it through, but please remember that I'm bleeding out.

791
01:08:10,200 --> 01:08:11,790
Okay. Here's the deal.

792
01:08:12,660 --> 01:08:14,620
We'll get her to your crew at the State House.

793
01:08:14,710 --> 01:08:18,080
But before we hand her over, they give us everything that we want.

794
01:08:18,170 --> 01:08:20,460
If not, we kill her, there and then. - Deal.

795
01:08:20,540 --> 01:08:22,170
- Really? That fast?

796
01:08:22,250 --> 01:08:25,590
You are all that matters. My team will not jeopardize that.

797
01:08:25,670 --> 01:08:28,510
Remember what I told you? Now go get your backpack.

798
01:08:29,970 --> 01:08:31,600
Now, Ellie.

799
01:08:41,860 --> 01:08:43,150
Let's go.

800
01:08:50,870 --> 01:08:52,120
Joel,

801
01:08:54,290 --> 01:08:55,410
don't fuck this up.

802
01:08:58,170 --> 01:08:59,380
Please.

803
01:09:50,680 --> 01:09:52,090
Give us a minute, all right?

804
01:09:52,180 --> 01:09:53,430
What the fuck?!

805
01:09:55,060 --> 01:09:56,350
So, what's the plan?

806
01:09:58,020 --> 01:09:59,810
There's not a lot of options.

807
01:09:59,890 --> 01:10:01,900
There's the short way or the long way.

808
01:10:01,980 --> 01:10:03,940
The short way is pretty much...

809
01:10:04,020 --> 01:10:05,520
That leaves the long way.

810
01:10:05,610 --> 01:10:07,440
Things look bad, we'll come up with something.

811
01:10:07,530 --> 01:10:10,110
We'll have to drop, head to Bill and Frank's.

812
01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:12,620
Stock up on anything we may need.

813
01:10:17,290 --> 01:10:19,710
THE BILLBOARD BOOK OF NUMBER 1 HITS

814
01:10:27,880 --> 01:10:31,300
We leave after dark. Stay with the kid.

815
01:10:32,180 --> 01:10:33,970
Wait. Why do I have to--

816
01:10:34,050 --> 01:10:36,180
Tess.

817
01:10:36,260 --> 01:10:37,720
60 - NOTHING IN

818
01:10:37,810 --> 01:10:39,100
70 - NEW STOCK 80 - X

819
01:10:44,020 --> 01:10:45,560
So, who's Bill and Frank?

820
01:10:49,030 --> 01:10:50,650
The radio's a smuggling code, right?

821
01:10:50,740 --> 01:10:52,700
'60s song, they don't have anything new,

822
01:10:52,780 --> 01:10:54,280
'70s, they got new stuff.

823
01:10:54,370 --> 01:10:55,830
What's '80s?

824
01:11:02,460 --> 01:11:04,790
What are you doing? - Killin' time.

825
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:07,550
- Well, what am I supposed to do? I'm sure you'll figure that out.

826
01:11:15,220 --> 01:11:16,510
Your watch is broken.

827
01:11:32,030 --> 01:11:33,530
You mumble in your sleep.

828
01:11:41,500 --> 01:11:43,620
I've never been on the other side of the Wall.

829
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:46,460
Look how dark it is.

830
01:11:53,670 --> 01:11:55,340
You guys go out there a lot?

831
01:11:56,430 --> 01:11:58,430
- I guess. - When was the last time?

832
01:11:58,970 --> 01:12:01,430
Maybe a year. What's it matter? But you know where to go.

833
01:12:02,730 --> 01:12:04,480
So we're gonna be okay.

834
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:10,520
Yeah.

835
01:12:17,780 --> 01:12:20,950
So what's the deal with you anyway? You some kinda bigwig's daughter or somethin'?

836
01:12:23,160 --> 01:12:24,540
Something like that.

837
01:12:34,260 --> 01:12:35,880
The radio came on when you were sleeping.

838
01:12:36,010 --> 01:12:38,760
What? What was the song?

839
01:12:38,840 --> 01:12:42,720
He kept sayin', like, "Wake me up before you go-go"?

840
01:12:43,560 --> 01:12:44,680
Shit.

841
01:12:45,730 --> 01:12:46,770
Gotcha.

842
01:12:47,350 --> 01:12:49,650
'80s means trouble.

843
01:12:50,270 --> 01:12:51,820
Code broken.

844
01:12:54,860 --> 01:12:56,150
Listen--

845
01:13:01,450 --> 01:13:04,370
The spot under Lancaster looks good.

846
01:13:04,450 --> 01:13:06,370
- You got a jacket in your pack? - Yeah.

847
01:13:06,460 --> 01:13:08,540
Okay, get it. It's time to go.

848
01:13:20,970 --> 01:13:25,140
...mandatory curfew to fight infection and insurrection.

849
01:13:28,100 --> 01:13:33,360
Observe mandatory curfew to fight infection and insurrection.

850
01:14:21,950 --> 01:14:24,620
Holy shit. I'm actually outside.

851
01:14:24,700 --> 01:14:26,160
- Jesus Christ. - Shit.

852
01:14:29,210 --> 01:14:32,420
Okay, we're gonna take the left edge around the buffer zone.

853
01:14:32,920 --> 01:14:35,250
You stay close and you follow my lead.

854
01:14:35,960 --> 01:14:37,340
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

855
01:14:38,340 --> 01:14:39,760
Let's go.

856
01:16:10,770 --> 01:16:11,810
What the hell?

857
01:16:11,890 --> 01:16:14,140
Hey, hey! Don't, don't, don't move.

858
01:16:15,140 --> 01:16:16,520
Don't move!

859
01:16:22,530 --> 01:16:24,110
You gotta be shittin' me.

860
01:16:24,200 --> 01:16:25,650
- Okay, let's talk this out.

861
01:16:25,740 --> 01:16:27,320
- Turn around. - Hold on--

862
01:16:27,410 --> 01:16:29,080
- Get on your fuckin' knees. Get on your fuckin' knees! - Now hold on--

863
01:16:29,160 --> 01:16:31,830
- What did I fuckin' tell you, man? I said stay the fuck home.

864
01:16:31,910 --> 01:16:33,540
Get on your knees!

865
01:16:33,620 --> 01:16:35,460
Just get on your knees, just get on your knees.

866
01:16:35,540 --> 01:16:39,790
Listen, you let us do this run, we'll split the cards with you.

867
01:16:39,880 --> 01:16:41,090
- Will you? - Yeah.

868
01:16:41,170 --> 01:16:44,260
I'm so blessed. Hands on your head. Eyes forward.

869
01:16:44,340 --> 01:16:45,970
Hands on your head!

870
01:16:49,510 --> 01:16:52,260
- Really, man? - Yep. We're doin' this by the book.

871
01:16:52,970 --> 01:16:54,560
Jesus Christ.

872
01:16:54,640 --> 01:16:56,890
All right. What about three-quarters?

873
01:16:57,650 --> 01:17:00,110
Unauthorized exit. They'll hang you for that.

874
01:17:00,190 --> 01:17:03,650
Fine. Everythin' off of this run, and half off on all of the pills.

875
01:17:03,730 --> 01:17:05,860
Half off? All off.

876
01:17:05,950 --> 01:17:09,200
Risk my job for half off. Outta your fuckin' mind--

877
01:17:09,620 --> 01:17:11,240
Ellie, Ellie! - Ellie, what the--  - Fuckin'

878
01:17:11,330 --> 01:17:13,410
bitch! Fuck!

879
01:17:14,250 --> 01:17:15,710
Get out of the fuckin' way!

880
01:17:18,790 --> 01:17:20,960
We can fix this. Move.

881
01:17:25,340 --> 01:17:26,510
Move.

882
01:18:04,090 --> 01:18:06,630
No, no! No, I'm not sick! - Joel!

883
01:18:06,710 --> 01:18:08,970
Joel, Joel! - I am not sick! I'm not sick!

884
01:18:09,050 --> 01:18:11,180
Look! Look! This is three weeks old.

885
01:18:11,260 --> 01:18:12,800
Nobody lasts more than a day!

886
01:18:12,890 --> 01:18:14,970
Does this look a day old to you?

887
01:18:15,060 --> 01:18:17,140
- You would've killed me! - I should fucking kill you!

888
01:18:17,220 --> 01:18:20,310
- When did it happen? - It doesn't matter! You have to trust me!

889
01:18:20,390 --> 01:18:22,480
They're gonna catch us if we don't run!

890
01:18:24,520 --> 01:18:28,150
Joel, we gotta move. We gotta move, Joel!

891
01:18:39,870 --> 01:18:41,120
Joel!

892
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:49,840
