1
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,360
替我向莎拉问好
Give Sarah my love.

2
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:07,350
多处撕裂伤
...multiple lacerations.

3
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:11,940
看看我女儿 她才五岁
My daughter, she's five years old.

4
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
嘿
Hey. 

5
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:33,880
没事了 这里是医院
It's okay. You're in the hospital.

6
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,750
你身上痛吗
Are you in pain?

7
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,420
我们可以给你注射止痛药
We can give you something.

8
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:44,890
艾莉
Ellie! 

9
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:46,760
艾莉
Ellie!

10
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,560
好了 艾莉 好了

11
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:54,230
- 好了 - 艾莉
Here.

12
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:56,520
没事了
It's okay.

13
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:08,970
{\an8}最后生还者
第二季第三集

14
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:08,970
本WEB版外挂字幕由  风吹来的那片云  双语合并

15
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25,570
(三个月后)

16
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:04,190
一到十级 你的疼痛有几级
And how would you rate your pain? Scale of one to ten?

17
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,740
不疼 零级
Nothing. Zero.

18
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:08,780
零级 已经很好了
Zero. Can't ask for much more than that.

19
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:12,370
来吧 最后一次肺功能检查
Okay. One last PFT.

20
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
你看
Look at that.

21
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,120
不错
Yeah.

22
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,080
挺好的 就是今天了
Alright. Today's the day.

23
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:23,590
- 那我可以... - 就快了
- So, can I just-- - Almost.

24
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:26,130
你还得见一个人 然后就能出院了
I just need you to see one more person, then you're good to go.

25
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:32,100
我的老天爷
Oh, for fuck's sake.

26
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,100
- 你好吗  - 挺好的
- How are you doing? - Fine.

27
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:38,520
回答这么快就是不好的表现
If you say it that fast, it kind of implies you're not.

28
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,810
好吧 再问我一遍
Okay, ask me again.

29
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:41,980
艾莉 你好吗
How are you doing, Ellie?

30
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:47,610
让我想想 这事很复杂 毕竟感觉这东西...
Give me a moment. It's really complicated 'cause, you know, feelings.

31
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:48,820
好吧
Okay.

32
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:51,320
拜托 我一直被困在这里 自从...
Oh, come on, man, I've been stuck in here since...

33
00:06:55,450 --> 00:07:00,040
没错 我想他 他对我来说很重要 我既伤心又难过
Yeah, I miss him. He meant a lot to me. So, yeah. Upset and sad.

34
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:01,710
当然
Of course.

35
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,750
但我好奇的是跨年夜的事
But I was actually wondering about New Year's Eve.

36
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:09,220
你们两个在舞会上吵架了 那是你最后一次和他说话吗
You two got into it at the dance. Was that the last time you spoke to him?

37
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:13,850
是
Yeah.

38
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:17,680
我回家时 他站在门廊上
When I got home, he was on the porch,

39
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:22,100
我该跟他聊聊的 但我没有
and I should've talked to him, but I didn't.

40
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:26,020
- 你后悔吗  - 当然后悔
- Do you regret that? - Yeah, of course.

41
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:30,650
但你和一个人最后相处的时光
But your final moment with someone 

42
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:32,700
不能定义你们整体的关系
doesn't define your whole time with them.

43
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:35,370
道理是这个道理 但事实往往如此
It shouldn't, but it often does.

44
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:40,620
在我和乔尔相处的最后时光里 他曾说...
In my last moment with Joel, he said he

45
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:42,790
他对不起你
wronged you.

46
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,000
可能很严重
Maybe bad.

47
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:51,340
他说他干什么了吗
What is it that he said that he did?

48
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:54,930
问题就在这儿 他的话前后不搭
Well, that's the thing. It didn't really make sense.

49
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,810
他说“我救了她”
He said, "I saved her."

50
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:02,270
他救过我很多次
He saved me a lot of times.

51
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:05,310
对 换我也会这么想 但那不算“对不起”
Yeah, I would think so. But that's not wronging someone.

52
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:08,270
真奇怪
That's weird.

53
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,740
我不知道他什么意思
No idea what he meant.

54
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:14,820
我没觉得他对不起我
I don't feel wronged.

55
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:20,500
不管他说的是什么 真希望我能放过他
Man, I wish I could have let him off the hook for whatever it was he was talking about.

56
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:26,170
现在我只能放过自己了
I guess I'll have to let myself off the hook for that.

57
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:29,670
你做得很好了
Well, you really are doing good.

58
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,380
见鬼
Shit, 

59
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:36,340
如果人人都像你这么健康 我还怎么换取大麻和酒啊
if everyone were as healthy as you, what would I do for weed and booze?

60
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:39,510
不用担心 这镇上还有很多操蛋的人
I wouldn't worry, Gail, there's still a lot of fucked up people in this town.

61
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,850
对 但你不是
Yeah. But not you, though.

62
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:14,510
(米勒)

63
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:24,640
(乔尔 谢谢你做的一切)

64
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:41,380
艾莉
Ellie?

65
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:46,640
妈的
Fuck.

66
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,980
我来了
Yeah, I'm coming.

67
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:09,990
我去医院了
I went to the hospital.

68
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,370
他们什么时候让你出院的
When'd they let you out?

69
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:16,080
- 30分钟前 - 很好
- Thirty minutes ago. - Nice.

70
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:18,710
他们让我见盖尔了
They made me talk to Gail.

71
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:25,380
我从来没说...
I never said--

72
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:30,550
你来看了我那么多次 我早该说谢谢了
I should have said thank you for all those times you came to visit.

73
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:33,430
不用客气 换我住院 你也会来看我的
That's okay. You would have done the same for me.

74
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,980
- 对 也许不会那么频繁 - 是啊 可能不会
- Yeah, maybe not as often. - Yeah, no, probably not.

75
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,690
我做了饼干给你吃
I made you cookies.

76
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:41,860
为什么
Just 'cause?

77
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:44,440
算是一份和解礼吧
This is a peace offering.

78
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,610
因为我要让你生气了
Because I'm about to make you angry.

79
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,410
在医院里...
In the hospital,

80
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,290
你曾问过我
when you asked me 

81
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:00,540
那天的事...
about that day,

82
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:04,340
我说我没听到任何有用的信息
I told you I didn't learn anything useful.

83
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,380
其实我没说实话
That wasn't true.

84
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,720
我知道他们大部分人的名字 也知道他们是哪里来的
I know most of their names, and I know where they're from.

85
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,810
你听我说完
Please, just listen. 

86
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:18,440
- 医生叫我不要让你太激动 - 我不在乎
- The doctors told me not to upset you. - I don't give a fuck.

87
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,480
我知道我一旦说出他们在哪 你会拔掉输液管
And I knew that if I told you where they were, you'd just start pulling your tubes out

88
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,440
爬也要爬过去找他们
and crawling on your hands and knees to get there.

89
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:25,230
我不在乎
I don't give a fuck.

90
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:29,700
你浪费了我们的时间 你让他们逃走了
You cost us time. You let them get away.

91
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:33,740
首先
First of all,

92
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:37,370
几个星期以来 这镇上一片狼藉 到处都是葬礼
this town was wreckage and funerals for weeks.

93
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,710
没人会去追杀任何人
Nobody was gonna go after anyone.

94
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:41,000
然后我突然想到
And then it occurred to me, if you wanna find someone,

95
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:44,710
如果你想找一个人 而你只知道对方最终的目的地...
and the only thing you know about them is where they're gonna end up.

96
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:49,130
还不如让对方先到了再说
Maybe let them get there.

97
00:14:57,810 --> 00:14:59,230
我也爱他
I loved him too, you know.

98
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:41,310
好吧 我们先说名字
Okay, let's start with names.

99
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:45,610
那个黑发男叫曼尼 另一个男的叫欧文
The dark-haired guy was Manny. The other guy was Owen.

100
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:48,320
黑发女孩和光头女孩里有一个叫诺拉
The girl with the dark hair and the bald one, one of them's named Nora. 

101
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,690
- 我不确定是哪个 - 那个扎辫子的女孩
- I'm not sure which. - The girl with the braid?

102
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:52,820
艾比
Abby.

103
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:54,450
艾比
Abby.

104
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:59,040
他们来自什么地方
Where are they from?

105
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:01,870
我在一个背包上看到了一块布章
I saw a patch on a backpack.

106
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,130
黄色三角 有个狼头...
Yellow triangle, wolf's head,

107
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:08,460
还有三个字母 WLF
and the letters W-L-F.

108
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:12,170
我记得尤金给我讲过 他还在火萤时的一个故事
And then, I remembered a story Eugene told me from back when he was a Firefly.

109
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:15,300
他说有些地区性小团体 都想对抗联邦救灾局
He said that there were these small regional groups in the West all trying to fight FEDRA,

110
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:18,220
还说他们没有联合起来真够蠢的
and how stupid it was that they didn't just join together.

111
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:22,350
其中一个团体就是华盛顿解放阵线
One of those groups was the Washington Liberation Front.

112
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,110
来自西雅图
Out of Seattle.

113
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:28,320
WLF 狼
W-L-F. Wolf.

114
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,610
一群傻逼
Fucking morons.

115
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:33,110
- 他有说这个团体有多小吗  - 没说
- Did he say how small they were? - No.

116
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,450
不过 既然从那以后没人提过他们
But seeing as how no one's ever mentioned them since,

117
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:37,660
我猜应该是我们能应付的小团体
I'm guessing small enough for us to handle.

118
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:41,040
还有谁知道这事
Who else knows?

119
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:42,660
就我们俩
Just us.

120
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:46,540
我没打算在告诉你之前告诉任何人
I wasn't gonna tell anyone before you.

121
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:07,860
现在怎么办
So, now what?

122
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:22,950
怎么样
Well?

123
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:25,250
我得考虑一下
I gotta think about this.

124
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:27,710
考虑什么 我们去干掉那些家伙
Think about what? Let's fucking get these guys.

125
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:29,790
艾莉 事情没那么简单
Ellie, it ain't that simple.

126
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:32,630
小镇还在恢复中 你也一样
The town is still recovering. So are you. 

127
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,970
- 我们明白你的出发点 - 不 我们不明白
- We get where you're coming from-- - No, we don't get where you're coming from. 

128
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:38,640
我不明白 如果死的人是你 乔尔早在天亮前就赶往西雅图了
I don't get where you're coming from. If it had been you, Joel would be halfway to Seattle before the sun came up.

129
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:41,260
他那么做一定是为了救我的命
He'd be halfway to Seattle to save my life.

130
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:43,890
可我们现在有伤亡 还不能走
But when we lost people, no.

131
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:45,980
换他也会崩溃的 他会把一切责任揽到自己身上
It would just break him like it was his fault. 

132
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:49,270
我见过很多次了 别以为我不了解他
I saw that time and time again. And don't talk to me like I didn't know him.

133
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:51,440
他是我哥哥
He was my brother.

134
00:17:56,990 --> 00:18:00,780
听着 我不是说你不该去
Listen, I'm not sayin' you shouldn't do this.

135
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:04,200
但是既然要组队 就得组一支像样的队伍
But if we're gonna put a posse together, we gotta do it right, 

136
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:07,870
把这件事告诉玛丽亚 没错 必须告诉她
which means taking it to Maria. Yes, it's fuckin' necessary.

137
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,790
她会召开议会 通知全镇
She's gonna want a council meeting, open it up to the town.

138
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:13,050
每个想发声的人都能发声
Everyone who wants to get heard gets heard.

139
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:15,670
但你会支持我们的 对吧
But you'll back us, right?

140
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:17,420
当然
Of course, I will.

141
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:22,220
过来
Come here.

142
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,520
还有你
And you, 

143
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:33,320
你要是再有事瞒着我 就去最累的岗位上待一个月
you hold out information on me again, you got rendering detail for a month.

144
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,440
好了
Alright.

145
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:42,490
还有 艾莉...
Ellie.

146
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:47,910
我们把死者埋在镇南十英里的地方了
We buried our dead ten miles south of town.

147
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:49,790
你可以去看他
If you want to visit him.

148
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,550
去西雅图的时候再去吧
When we're on our way to Seattle.

149
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:11,480
(普吉特步道 植物园 西雅图步道)

150
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:52,900
怎么样
Well?

151
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:57,940
没人跟来 很安全 继续前进
"No one following. All clear. Keep moving."

152
00:19:58,070 --> 00:19:59,070
很好
Good.

153
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:02,110
等我们重新安顿好 我们会教你吹口哨的
Once we get resettled, I'll teach you to whistle.

154
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,080
你为什么不能告诉我目的地是哪里
Why can't you tell me where we're going?

155
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,450
因为我们还不知道
'Cause we don't know yet.

156
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:12,620
我已经说了我们要去的原因
I've told you the reason we're going.

157
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:16,840
我知道 但她为什么不能保护我们
I know, but why can't she just keep us safe?

158
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,090
先知
The Prophet?

159
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:23,430
她十年前就死了 康斯坦丝 我可不会指望她帮我们
She's been dead ten years, Constance. I wouldn't count on her to help.

160
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:26,180
但艾斯拉说先知是永生的
But Ezra said the Prophet is eternal.

161
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:29,060
从某种角度看没错
Well, she is, in a way.

162
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,100
但先知不是魔法
A prophet isn't magic.

163
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,560
他们只是...
They're just 

164
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:34,810
能看到别人看不到的真相
people that see truths hidden from others

165
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:37,400
并且不计代价分享真相的人
and share that truth, no matter what the cost.

166
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:40,440
我们的先知也是如此
So it was with our Prophet.

167
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:42,110
- 没错 - 没错
So it was.

168
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,400
我们就是这样让她的精神永存的
That's how we keep her spirit alive.

169
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:49,700
遵循她的话语 服从她的教诲 同时保护自己的安全
Follow her words, we obey her teachings, but we keep ourselves safe.

170
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:55,710
那能给我一把锤子吗
Then, can I have a hammer?

171
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:00,340
好
Alright.

172
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:06,390
告诉我 你觉得更安全了吗
Tell me, you feel safer?

173
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:08,010
是的
Yes.

174
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,600
很好
Good.

175
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,770
要知道 我们现在给你的东西
Understand, what we're giving you now,

176
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:15,440
会比锤子给你更多的安全感
will keep you far, far safer than a hammer.

177
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:18,900
那就是出离
Distance.

178
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:21,820
出离家乡
From home.

179
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,490
出离战争
From war.

180
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:36,290
找掩护 快
Take cover! Go!

181
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:54,560
是恶魔吗
Demons?

182
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,640
是狼
Wolves.

183
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:03,900
很好 注意旋转 再来
Alright. Good, but rotate. More.

184
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:07,610
现在换右边 只打右边
Now, the right side. Just the right side.

185
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:10,240
- 这边伤害更大 - 我注意到了
- Come on, man, that side hurts more. - I noticed.

186
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:11,910
- 来吧 - 好
- Come on. - Okay.

187
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:17,290
用力点 坚持住 最后五拳
Harder. Harder! Let's go! Last five.

188
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:24,000
- 好了 今天到此为止 - 好
- There it is, okay. Done for the day. - Okay.

189
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,340
你觉得怎么样
So, what'd you think?

190
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:29,380
一个无所事事三个月的人能做成这样
Well, for someone who sat on their ass for three months, 

191
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:31,260
- 我觉得很惊喜 - 是吗
- I'm pleasantly surprised. - Yeah?

192
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:32,390
平时做俯卧撑了
Push-ups?

193
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:34,390
对 还在他们不注意时卷腹了
Yeah, and crunches when they weren't looking.

194
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:38,600
这样就行了 再过几周 你就能恢复原来的状态
Yeah, that'll do it. A few more weeks, and you'll be right back to where you were before.

195
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:40,100
很好
Nice.

196
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:43,610
- 也就是你该有的水平的八成 - 随便了 去你的
- Which is 80% of where you should have been. - Whatever. Fuck you.

197
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:50,490
听说你加入议会了
So, I heard you're on the council now.

198
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:52,120
对
Yep.

199
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:54,620
那你肯定知道接下来的会议
So, you know about the meeting coming up?

200
00:22:56,790 --> 00:22:58,290
没错 我知道
I know about the meeting coming up.

201
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:01,500
我能指望你吗
Can I count on you?

202
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:05,750
我不能讨论即将开始的投票
I can't discuss upcoming votes.

203
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:08,420
- 搞什么 是我啊 - 我知道
- Seriously? It's me. - I know.

204
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:10,930
老兄 当时你也在场
Dude, you were there.

205
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:12,340
这我也知道
I know that too.

206
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:14,510
我得走了
Gotta go.

207
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:17,270
老天
Oh, my God.

208
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:20,140
艾莉
Ellie.

209
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:23,860
听完大家的意见 议会才能作决定
The council won't make up their mind until we hear people speak.

210
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:25,980
所以我给你一点建议
So, here's a little advice.

211
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:29,990
把你的想法整理清楚 写下来 明天念给大家听
Organize your thoughts, write them down, and then read 'em out loud tomorrow.

212
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:33,870
- 知道了 因为我很蠢 - 因为你愤怒 艾莉
- Okay, yeah, 'cause I'm stupid. - 'Cause you're angry, Ellie.

213
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:36,580
没人会投票给愤怒的人
And no one's gonna vote for angry.

214
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:48,460
...所以我一直说我们要多投资火鸡
Which is why I keep saying we need to invest more in turkeys 

215
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:49,800
少投资鸡
and less in chickens.

216
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:53,260
这就要说回我之前对玉米的看法了
And that brings me back to my earlier point about corn.

217
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:57,060
有些人听我这么说过 玉米不是最容易种植的作物
Corn, some of you have heard me say, is not the easiest crop to grow, 

218
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:59,180
但它是生长最快的作物之一
but it is among the fastest.

219
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:03,810
你们可以绘一张图 把收成时间和所需资源以及难易度...
You can plot a graph that shows ease and resources versus time to harvest and get a li--

220
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:07,520
斯考特 抱歉打断你 不要偏题
Scott, I'm sorry, but we gotta keep you on target here.

221
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:10,990
这是公开会议 章程上说...
But it's an open meeting. The bylaws say that--

222
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:14,200
或许我们应该回到 大家原本要讨论的议程上来
Maybe we should stick to what everyone else came here to discuss.

223
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:17,200
我对西雅图的事没意见
I don't really have an opinion on the Seattle thing.

224
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:19,040
好 谢谢
Okay. Thank you.

225
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:23,620
斯考特说完了 接下来是瑞秋
So, that was Scott. Next is Rachel.

226
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:26,880
乔尔对我们很多人来说非常重要...
Yeah, Joel meant so much to so many of us.

227
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,960
我听不见 大声点
Can't hear you.

228
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,550
- 你能帮我抱着他吗  - 好
- Can you take him, please? - Yeah. 

229
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:33,680
来吧
Okay, here we go.

230
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:43,600
我说乔尔对我们很多人来说非常重要
I said that Joel meant so much to so many of us.

231
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,060
但他并非唯一一个重要的人
But he wasn't the only one.

232
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:48,940
那天我失去了我妹妹
I lost my sister that day.

233
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:52,190
这里很多人都埋葬了家人
A lot of people in here buried family.

234
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,610
现在你们要派去16个顶尖成员
And now, you wanna send, what, you're saying 16 of our best?

235
00:24:57,570 --> 00:25:00,200
他们不在的时候 如果掠夺者来了 谁去墙上抵御他们
Well, while they're gone, who's gonna be on the wall if Raiders come?

236
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:02,120
墙还没修好呢
A wall that's barely mended.

237
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:05,870
而且谁也不能保证 那16个人都能回来
And none of you up there can promise us that all 16 will come back.

238
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:10,590
我同情你们 汤米和艾莉
So, my heart is with you, Tommy and Ellie.

239
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:13,760
但我们伤亡惨重 现在出击太早了
We are too hurt, and it is too soon.

240
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:16,220
谢谢你 瑞秋
Thank you, Rachel.

241
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,100
下一位是卡莱尔
Next is Carlisle.

242
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:29,230
我长话短说 毕竟这是个简单的决定
I'll be quick. 'Cause this one's simple to me.

243
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:31,980
有人来我们这里
People came 

244
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:33,940
杀了乔尔
and killed Joel.

245
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:37,450
我们为什么不想复仇
So, why wouldn't we wanna take our vengeance?

246
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:41,200
因为我们不该那么做
Well, because we're not supposed to.

247
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:45,410
宽恕他人 方能被人宽恕
Forgive and be forgiven.

248
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:49,130
放下怨恨和仇恨
No grudges. No revenge.

249
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:53,090
我都不是基督徒 可我一直觉得这么做很明智
And I'm not even a Christian. I've always seen the wisdom in that.

250
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:57,970
这正是我们与掠夺者和杀人犯 不同的地方
That's what separates us from the Raiders and the murderers.

251
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:00,800
我们懂得仁慈
Our capacity for mercy.

252
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:04,060
那些混蛋不配得到我们的仁慈
Those sons of bitches don't deserve our mercy.

253
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,770
当然不配 所以才叫仁慈啊
Well, of course they don't deserve it.

254
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:09,230
去你的屁话
That's what makes it mercy.

255
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:12,110
你能这么说 也不是什么好东西
Well, to hell with that. And to hell with you for saying it, Carlisle.

256
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:13,230
- 赛斯 坐下 - 不
- Seth, sit down. - No.

257
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,820
- 你不在发言名单上 - 不
- You're not on the list. - No!

258
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,530
我们到底在说什么
What the hell are we all talking about here?

259
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:20,950
哎呦 太不公平了
It's not fair.

260
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:24,490
我们要原谅每一个 骑在我们头上拉屎的人吗
What, we gotta forgive everybody when they show up and piss in our eye?

261
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,410
他们闯进了我们家
They came into our house.

262
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:29,370
抓走了我们的人
They took one of ours.

263
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,130
天啊
My God, 

264
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:34,500
有人射杀了你们的兄弟 你们还想把门锁拆了
somebody shoots your brother, you wanna take the locks off your doors?

265
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:35,880
幼稚
Grow up!

266
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:38,840
你们这些白痴 他们还会回来的
You idiots, they'll come back.

267
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:42,760
因为我们没让他们付出代价
They'll come back because we didn't make 'em pay.

268
00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:45,390
等他们回来时 一定带着嘲笑的嘴脸
And when they come back, they'll be laughing.

269
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,850
而你们都活该
And you'll all deserve it.

270
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,520
你们这群...
Bunch of 

271
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:53,980
该死的受害者
goddamn victims.

272
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:05,870
(斯考特 瑞秋 卡莱尔 艾莉)

273
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,500
艾莉
Ellie?

274
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:31,140
“我通常不会准备发言稿”
I normally don't write things down

275
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:33,610
“因为我向来有话直说 不假思索”
because I normally don't think before I talk,

276
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:36,730
“这让我惹上了不少麻烦”
which has gotten me in trouble before, a lot,

277
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:40,240
“让我付出了无法挽回的代价”
and it's cost me in ways that sometimes couldn't be undone.

278
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:45,580
“但我这次输不起 因为我知道我的要求很过分”
But I can't afford that right now, because I know what I'm asking is a lot.

279
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:49,160
“我要我们在最糟的时机”
I'm asking us to risk more people and resources,

280
00:27:49,290 --> 00:27:51,250
“拿更多的人力和资源去冒险”
and at the worst possible time.

281
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:55,340
“我想告诉大家 我想要的并非复仇”
And I want everyone to know, it's not because I want revenge.

282
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:57,800
“真的 这跟复仇无关”
It's not. It's not about revenge.

283
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:00,260
“我要的是 你们过去给予他人的东西”
What I want is what you used to give people.

284
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,970
“我要正义”
I want justice.

285
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:07,560
“因为除此之外 就只剩沉默与放弃了”
Because it's either that, or we do nothing.

286
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:12,390
“而外面的人 也只会默默地放弃我们”
That's what everyone else out there is going to do for us.

287
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:15,190
“如果我或你们遭遇不幸”
Nothing. A whole world of people who won't lift a finger

288
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:18,150
“全世界没有人愿意动一动手指”
if something bad happens to me or you.

289
00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:21,490
“我们有专门的词称呼这种人”
We have a word for these people.

290
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,110
“那就是‘陌生人’”
They're called strangers.

291
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,910
“我觉得我们之间不是陌生人”
Well, I don't think that we're strangers to each other.

292
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:29,450
“我得知道我能依靠你们”
And I want to know that I can count on you.

293
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:33,370
“我发誓 如果有人伤害你们或你们爱的人”
And I swear, if someone hurts any of you or the people you love, 

294
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:35,000
“你们也可以依靠我”
you can count on me.

295
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:37,460
“这才是我们的凝聚力”
That's what holds all this together.

296
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:41,340
“不是聚餐 也不是跨年舞会”
Not potluck dinners or New Year's Eve dances.

297
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:45,010
“更不是一堵墙 因为那堵墙已经被撞破了”
Definitely not a wall, because that thing got busted through.

298
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:47,010
“而杰克逊依然挺立”
But Jackson is still here.

299
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:52,350
“我会接受议会的一切决议”
I'll accept whatever the council decides.

300
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,600
“但我拜托你们”
But I am asking you, please,

301
00:28:56,810 --> 00:28:59,610
“不惜一切代价伸张正义”
do what it takes to see that justice is done.

302
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,360
“不是为了我”
Not for me. 

303
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,570
“甚至不是为了乔尔”
Not even for Joel.

304
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:10,830
“我拜托你们为我们大家这么做”
I am asking you, please, do it for us.

305
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:16,790
谢谢
Thank you.

306
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:31,310
议会将就派遣16名成员前往西雅图
The council will now vote on the proposal to send a party of 16 citizens to Seattle

307
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:34,930
寻找并处决杀害乔尔之人的提案 进行投票
to find the people who killed Joel and execute them.

308
00:29:57,370 --> 00:29:58,370
艾米贝丝
Amy-Beth?

309
00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:04,170
“赞成”
Yes.

310
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:07,220

“赞成”

315
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:21,610
“反对”
No.

316
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:24,940
“反对”
No.

317
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:27,360
“反对”
No.

318
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:29,910
“反对”
No.

319
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:32,990
“反对”
No.

320
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:39,790
八票反对 三票赞成 提案被否决了
The vote is 8 to 3. The proposal is rejected.

321
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:46,670
休庭
Adjourned.

322
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:14,410
加油 九号球员
Here we go, nine. Here we go.

323
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:18,910
- 好了 盯紧球  - 快
Grab the ball!

324
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:21,920
- 好样的 九号  - 加油 罗德尼 冲啊
Attaboy, nine!

325
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,750
- 该死 - 他没事
Oh, shit.

326
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,710
我都不知道你是球迷
I didn't know you were a fan.

327
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:29,220
当然 我当年可买过老虎队的季票呢
Hell, yeah! I had Tigers season tickets.

328
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:33,600
这其实跟2003年的球队差不多
This actually isn't that far off from the '03 squad.

329
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:38,270
要喝啤酒吗 我跟马歇尔拿的
You want a beer? I get them from Marshall.

330
00:31:51,530 --> 00:31:54,070
今天开会时 我在人群中看到你了
I spotted you in the crowd at the meeting today.

331
00:31:55,410 --> 00:31:56,410
对
Yeah.

332
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:59,040
我心想
And I thought to myself,

333
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:02,370
“她过去几周可能特别忙”
she's probably been extra busy these last few weeks.

334
00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:04,750
太残忍了
Brutal.

335
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:09,010
我自己都该去看心理医生 消化发生的一切
And I'm supposed to see a shrink myself, you know, to process it all, it's...

336
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:10,130
可这里没有别人了
I'm the only one here.

337
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:14,140
- 那你怎么办  - 我是个酒鬼
- So, what do you do, then? - Oh, well, I'm an alcoholic.

338
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:16,510
而且我尽可能地多抽大麻
And I smoke as much weed as I can.

339
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,470
真是一场大灾难
You know, complete fuckin' disaster.

340
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:21,390
但你来找我不是因为担心我
But you're not here 'cause you're worried about me.

341
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:24,520
两人出局了 各位 加油
Two outs, guys, two outs. Look alive!

342
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:25,730
我不知道
I don't know.

343
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:30,070
你能看到别人看不到的东西
You see things that others don't.

344
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:34,280
我担心她会做傻事
I'm nervous she's gonna do somethin' stupid.

345
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:37,660
- 怎么 你不相信她的发言  - 你相信吗
- What, you didn't believe her speech? - Did you?

346
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:39,540
当然不信 她是个骗子
Course not. She's a liar.

347
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:42,620
撒谎的人不一定是骗子
Well, there's a difference between lyin' and being a liar.

348
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:45,170
我知道 她就是骗子
Oh, I know. And that one? Liar.

349
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:48,630
她可能只跟一个人说过实话 而他已经...
There was maybe one person she told the truth to, and he's...

350
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,630
但我们可以在这一点上各持己见
But we can agree to disagree about that.

351
00:32:55,220 --> 00:33:00,220
问题是你很害怕 那我们谈谈吧
What matters is you're afraid. So, let's talk about it.

352
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:02,180
不收钱
Okay. Free of charge.

353
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:08,400
我只是不想看她步乔尔的后尘
I just don't want her to go down the same paths that Joel did.

354
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:13,740
他满口的正当理由
Comin' up with justifications and such.

355
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:18,240
其实只是在宣泄而已
All he was really doin' was lashin' out.

356
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:21,240
你觉得她的行为可能是跟他学的
So, you think she might have learned that behavior from him?

357
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:29,670
其实后天教养的作用微乎其微 其余的都是天性
Turns out nurture can only do this much. The rest is nature.

358
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:33,130
就算她走上某条路 那也不是乔尔教她的
If she's on a path, it's not one that Joel put her on.

359
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:35,970
不是
No. No.

360
00:33:36,090 --> 00:33:39,600
我觉得他们一开始就是并肩而行
I think they were walking side by side from the very start.

361
00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:44,230
汤米 我明白
Tommy, I get it.

362
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:48,100
现在她归你管了 你想帮她避开麻烦
You inherited her, and you wanna keep her out of trouble.

363
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:51,110
作为从业40年的心理医生 我劝你一句
Take it from a psychotherapist of 40 years.

364
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:53,110
有些人...
Some people just...

365
00:33:57,490 --> 00:33:59,820
有些人无法拯救
Some people just can't be saved.

366
00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:30,480
- 是谁  - 迪娜
- Who is it? - Dina.

367
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,400
好吧 你好
Hey.

368
00:34:37,990 --> 00:34:39,740
我要睡了
I'm just going to bed.

369
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:42,990
我不相信
No, I don't think that is where you're going.

370
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:49,620
就你一个人吗
Are you alone?

371
00:34:50,370 --> 00:34:51,500
是的
I'm alone.

372
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:00,840
进来
Get in.

373
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:03,680
天啊
Oh, Christ.

374
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:06,890
- 别劝我放弃 - 你以为我是来劝你的
- Please don't try and talk me out of this. - You think that's why I'm here?

375
00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:10,140
说说你的计划吧
So, what's your plan?

376
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:14,110
去西雅图杀死艾比
Go to Seattle and kill Abby.

377
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:15,400
路线呢
What route?

378
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:18,150
西北方
Northwest.

379
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:22,570
这里面都是枪吗 有没有医疗用品
And is that all guns, or do you have medical supplies in there? No?

380
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:26,450
你最好别在你规划好的西北路线上
Well, better not land weird on an ankle

381
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:29,960
崴了脚或发高烧
or get a fever on your well-charted path "northwest."

382
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:31,960
好吧 我该怎么办
Okay, so what am I supposed to do?

383
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:41,510
远离高速 避开城市或聚落
Stay off the highways. Steer clear of cities or settlements.

384
00:35:41,630 --> 00:35:43,550
第一阶段是穿越国家森林
First stage is through the national forest.

385
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,890
出来后 我们沿蛇河峡谷前进
Once we're out, we follow the Snake River Canyon,

386
00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:49,850
- 然后穿越斯诺夸尔米山口 - 斯诺夸尔米
- then break off through the Snoqualmie Pass. - Snoqualmie?

387
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:51,890
对 斯诺夸尔米
Yeah. Snoqualmie.

388
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:55,770
从东边接近西雅图 然后根据情况重新做评估
Approach Seattle from the east, then reassess based on what we find.

389
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:58,530
带好粮食 轻装上路 但要聪明
Provisions. Travel light, but smart.

390
00:35:58,650 --> 00:36:00,570
拿厚外套当床垫 拿夹克当被子
Winter coats for beds, jackets for blankets.

391
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:04,950
急救箱 电池和防熊喷雾都带上 你要带什么手枪
First aid kits, batteries, bear spray. Now, handguns. What are you bringing?

392
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:08,240
这是乔尔的吗
Is that Joel's?

393
00:36:10,370 --> 00:36:12,170
你打算用这个杀死她
So, that's what you're gonna kill her with?

394
00:36:12,290 --> 00:36:14,250
- 没错 - 那就留到那时候再用
- Fuckin' right. - Then, save it for that.

395
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:15,840
它的速度很慢 后坐力特别强
It's slow and kicks like hell.

396
00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:20,840
真的吗 你想轰掉你的屁股
Really? Shoot your damn ass off?

397
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:22,760
有人这么劝过我
I've heard that before.

398
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:25,800
我们每人起码得有一百发子弹 加上五十发步枪子弹
We'll want at least 100 shells apiece, plus 50 rifle rounds.

399
00:36:25,930 --> 00:36:28,310
你想带什么长枪都可以 只要有瞄准镜就行
Bring any long gun you want, as long as it's scoped.

400
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:31,180
氯片 平底锅 还有帮闪闪保持干燥的东西
Chlorine tablets, a pan, and something to keep Shimmer dry.

401
00:36:31,310 --> 00:36:32,850
- 只带闪闪吗  - 对
- Just Shimmer? - Yeah.

402
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:34,690
我们共骑一匹马 减少资源
We share a horse. Fewer resources.

403
00:36:34,810 --> 00:36:38,360
其他东西都跟你想的一样 除了这个
Everything else is what you'd figure, except this.

404
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:40,780
靴子
Boots.

405
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:44,320

和跨年夜有关
It's about New Year's Eve, and, you know,

And you were drunk.

468
00:45:47,110 --> 00:45:49,830
对 所以那不能代表什么 你是想问这个吧
Right, so it doesn't mean anything, if that's what you're asking.

469
00:45:49,950 --> 00:45:52,870
不 这个我知道 我想问的是
No, I know that. My question is,

470
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:56,870
你会给那个吻打几分
how would you rate it?

471

- 一到十分  - 不
- Scale of one to ten. - No.

你是同性恋 而我不是

我只是好奇 我想知道我厉不厉害

What?

480

郑重声明一下 我不相信你
For the record, I don't believe you.

481
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:29,410
你非要问 我就答了 对不起
Well, you asked, and I told you. I'm sorry.

482

You can go back to Jesse.

483

484
00:46:35,790 --> 00:46:37,210
那就行了
Well, there you have it.

485
00:46:49,090 --> 00:46:51,010
他有没有给你一种悲伤的感觉

486
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:53,890
杰西吗 有
Jesse? Yeah.

487
00:46:56,310 --> 00:46:57,680
他跟你说过原因吗
Has he ever told you why?

488
00:46:59,270 --> 00:47:00,310
没有
No.

489
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:06,030
但我觉得他内心深处就是悲伤的人
But I think deep inside, that's just how he is.

490
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:12,660
- 至少我希望是这样 - 为什么
- At least, I hope that's why. - Why would you hope that?

491
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:19,460
因为如果不是的话...
Well, because if it's not that,

492
00:47:21,330 --> 00:47:22,580
那就是我的问题了
then it's me.

理论上 我们会从城北五号公路附近穿出去
In theory, we'll come out near Highway Five, just north of the city.

Doing okay?

510
00:50:08,670 --> 00:50:11,960
对不起 我从没有过这种反应
Yeah, I'm sorry, it's just that's never happened before.

511
00:50:13,710 --> 00:50:16,470
- 可能是气味太重 - 而且惨不忍睹
- I think it was the smell. - It wasn't easy to look at either.

512
00:50:20,220 --> 00:50:21,640
如果这是他们干的...
If this was fucking them,

513
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:24,640
如果艾比和她的人能对人干出这种事

不 是我自创的 我只是想显得我厉害一点
No, that was just me. I was trying to sound like a badass.
