1
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:11,170
It'll be fine.

2
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:15,180
- He's gonna beat the shit outta me. - I said, it'll be fine.

3
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:18,220
I'm gonna get the belt.

4
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:19,350
No, you're not.

5
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:21,770
I will.

6
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:27,310
Just go to your room, and stay there.

9
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:10,320
I'm back on patrol in 30 minutes. So, talk fast. What happened?

10
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:13,030
You know what happened.

11
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:15,150
Yeah, well, I wanna hear it from you.

12
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:20,410
I was buying pot from this other kid.

13
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:22,620
He tried to rip me off, and we got into a fight.

14
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:27,040
- That's what you're going with? Okay. - I'm telling the truth.

15
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:28,750
No. No, you're not.

16
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:31,460
I think Tommy was buying the drugs, not you.

17
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:34,880
I think you happened to walk by, saw what was going on, and started punching. 

18
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:37,510
- Tommy didn't do anyth-- - I talked to the kid you beat up, Joel,

19
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:40,390
and the officers who got called to the scene. I'm not stupid.

20
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,850
And if you and Tommy weren't my sons, you'd both be in juvie right now.

21
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:49,400
You're not gonna hurt him.

22
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:27,100
Did I ever tell you about that time I stole a candy bar?

23
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:31,560
I was ten.

24
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:34,900
Grandpa found out, 

25
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:37,780
made me give it back, made me apologize to the cashier.

26
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:40,740
And then, we went home.

27
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:44,330
Just before I got out of the car, man, he just...

28
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:47,450
He broke my jaw. 

29
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:49,960
There was blood everywhere.

30
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:52,080
Grandma thought I was dead.

31
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:56,920
My mouth was wired shut for two months.

32
00:02:58,170 --> 00:02:59,970
Everybody knew why. 

33
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:02,510
It was humiliating.

34
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:06,640
If you know what it feels like, then why?

35
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,230
That's not why I'm telling you this.

36
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:14,690
Okay, yeah, I've hit you. And I've hit Tommy.

37
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:19,320
But never like that.

38
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,650
Not even close.

39
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:23,700
I mean, maybe I go too far, I...

40
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:26,580
I don't know, I just...

41
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:29,910
I don't know.

42
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,790
But I'm doing a little better than my father did.

43
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:43,800
And you know, when it's your turn,

44
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:49,060
I hope you do a little better than me.

47
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:49,510
- The new guy. - Been here two months, Seth.

48
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:52,930
Like I said. Got somethin' for me?

49
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,440
I'll be fucked.

50
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:05,780
My grandkids are gonna love these. How'd you find 'em?

51
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:08,400
Searched the old homes out by Hoback.

52
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,490
I searched those homes.

53
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,620
Well, I know where to look 'cause I'm a smuggler, and you're a...

54
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:16,910
I wasn't always this.

55
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:25,510
I was a cop.

56
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:27,760
Milwaukee PD.

57
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:36,270
So, a trade's a trade.

58
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:39,440
We can make what you want and have it to you by

59
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:43,610
- Friday. - No, I need it by tomorrow.

60
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:50,360
Vanilla or chocolate? Say vanilla, it's easier.

61
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:52,070
Vanilla.

62
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:54,660
Oh, I need one more thing.

63
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,700
Relax. You got a lot of 'em.

64
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:27,750
Joel!

65
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:35,640
- What happened? - Where'd you come from?

66
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,970
- Painkillers, she's alright. Come on. - Painkillers?

67
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:41,850
No, no, no. No, no, no, leave it. Leave it, don't touch it.

68
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:43,270
Tommy, what happened?

69
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:45,730
She was working KP and she burned her arm.

70
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:46,940
Well, how?

71
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:50,900
- I pushed it right up against a pot. - You did this on purpose?

72
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:54,360
I was like, "Here we go," and then I fucking went.

73
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:55,860
What? Why?

74
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:58,160
No one saw. I was on my own.

75
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:01,950
And I took it off and it was all red and melting and gross.

76
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,580
You know what it smelled like? Pork.

77
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:07,290
- Who let this happen? - What do you mean, "let"?

78
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:09,500
Who saw this comin'? I was eating my damn dinner.

79
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:11,250
- Oh, it hurts. - Okay.

80
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:12,670
Easy, baby girl.

81
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,090
- Easy, easy. - Dr. V ran over to the clinic.

82
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:17,300
He's gonna come by here with another shot.

83
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:18,430
Ellie.

84
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:25,020
I just really wanted to wear short sleeves again.

85
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:29,360
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

86
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,480
It's okay.

87
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,400
It's okay. You're okay.

88
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:13,520
- Goddammit, Seth. - Hey.

89
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:17,490
Hey.

90
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:23,700
"Happy 15th Birthday, Eli."

91
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:30,290
Well, let's hope Seth bakes better than he spells.

92
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:34,210
He does.

93
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:37,300
It's really good.

94
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,800
Oh, right.

95
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:47,930
Stay right there. I got somethin' else for you. Close your eyes.

96
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:51,650
Keep 'em closed.

97
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:55,900
Okay, turn toward me.

98
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,570
And, open.

99
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,910
- What's this? - Some folks call this a "gee-tar."

100
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:11,040
I borrowed one of your drawings for inspiration.

101
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:16,170
Took a bit of restorin'. Real bone saddle here.

102
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:20,800
Lacquered the whole body and used a Dremel to carve the...

103
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:23,550
Well, that's a rotary drill. Or could be a saw, dependin' on the tip.

104
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,720
But, actually, it's a pretty versatile tool.

105
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,480
Anyway.

106
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,730
I had promised I would teach you, so.

107
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:39,070
Well, if you want a lesson later.

108
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:40,860
Let me hear something.

109
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:45,200
- What do you mean, play it? - And sing.

110
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:48,700
No. No, no, no, no. No, I don't sing.

111
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:51,660
It's my fucking birthday, man. Let's see what you got.

112
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,100
Shit.

113
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:30,470
Well,

114
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:32,930
that didn't suck.

115
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:54,660
I understand.

116
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,500
Your arm.

117
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:01,790
I understand.

118
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:08,880
Happy birthday, kiddo.

120
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:22,110
- Is it a bow and arrow? - Nope.

121
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:25,150
- Is it water guns? - No. 

122
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:28,900
- Is it a dinosaur! - You're not gonna guess.

123
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:31,990
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Is it a "lotter" of kittens?

124
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,240
A "lotter"?

125
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:35,620
You mean a litter?

126
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:37,620
A litter of kittens? Really?

127
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,330
- Really. And no. - Fuck.

128
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:41,420
Is it a convertible?

129
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:43,500
The hell are you gonna do with a convertible?

130
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:44,630
Drive it.

131
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:45,880
We cross here.

132
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,890
How do you even know where we are?

133
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:55,220
I found it on patrol.

134
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:59,480
You know, Jesse was 16 when he started going on patrols.

135
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,600
Is that right?

136
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:04,480
Don't get me wrong. I love counting vegetables and shoveling sheep shit.

137
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:08,110
I'm just saying, I think I could be more useful outside the wall.

138
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,990
You'll get on patrols eventually. You should enjoy being a kid for now.

139
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,870
Oh, because childhood has been such a joy for me so far.

140
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:18,330
You've been 16 all of four hours.

141
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:20,410
We're not sending you out until you're trained.

142
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:23,130
You're gonna need somethin' called patience.

143
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:24,840
Jesse said he'd train me if you let him.

144
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,760
Is there somethin' going on between you two?

145
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:31,590
- Excuse me? - You spend a lot of time together.

146
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:34,260
Is it funny?

147
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:38,640
I see the way you look at him. I got a keen eye for these sort of things.

148
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:41,350
- I don't think you do. - Alright, none of my business.

149
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:44,440
But has anyone talked to you about the birds and the bees?

150
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,690
You mean dicks and vaginas?

151
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:49,110
- Jesus. - I tell you what.

152
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:52,780
I promise you, I won't get pregnant if you let me train for patrols. Deal?

153
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:55,490
I'll see what I can do.

154
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:57,370
Okay, how much longer, man?

155
00:15:58,620 --> 00:15:59,620
We're here.

156
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:14,220
Oh, my God. It is a dinosaur!

157
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,840
- Joel! - Like it?

158
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:19,060
Yeah. Likes it.

159
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:28,230
Ellie.

160
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:30,030
Ellie!

161
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:33,280
Oh, my God. 

162
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,240
Careful.

163
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:39,540
I'm on a motherfucking dinosaur!

164
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:44,250
- Joel, there's a museum! - Yeah, I know!

165
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:47,380
If you don't fall off the goddamn T-Rex, I'll take you there.

166
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,850
This is so cool.

167
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:03,270
How long have you known about this place?

168
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:04,390
A while.

169
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:06,650
Well, then what the fuck?

170
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,570
I was saving it for a special day.

171
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:10,730
You see? 

172
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:14,450
- Patience. - Oh, yeah, I've heard of that.

174
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:51,610
It works?

175
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:53,440
Somebody must have greased it.

176
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,330
Can you imagine being up there?

177
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:09,000
- Would you like to? - Like to what?

178
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,880
Go to space?

179
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,560
Is it real?

180
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:33,190
It's real. That one went up and back.

181
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:36,280
Apollo 15, 1971.

182
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:54,590
Well, open it.

183
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,720
You got it.

184
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:13,150
You're going up to space. You need a helmet.

185
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:22,490
Pick one.

186
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,950
- How's it smell in there? - Like space, 

187
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:08,950
and dust.

188
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:11,210
Well, good. Then, you're ready.

189
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:42,400
People of Discovery, set! Abort!

190
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:49,530
They sat right here.

191
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:55,750
Happy birthday, kiddo. 

192
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:58,170
- What's this? - This 

193
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,960
is something that took a mighty effort to find.

194
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:03,090
Play it.

195
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:20,940
Close your eyes.

196
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,400
It'll be worth it.

197
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,620
Thirty seconds and counting.

198
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:35,330
Astronauts report it feels good. T-minus 25 seconds.

199
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:40,170
Twenty seconds and counting.

200
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:45,840
T-minus 15 seconds. Guidance is internal.

201
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:49,550
Twelve, eleven, ten, nine.

202
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,680
Ignition sequence starts.

203
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:59,150
Six, five, four, three, two, one, zero.

204
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:00,610
All engines running.

205
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,650
Liftoff! We have a liftoff,

206
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:07,570
32 minutes past the hour, liftoff on Apollo 11.

207
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:51,160
I do okay?

208
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,490
Are you kidding me?

209
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:17,850
This is nice.

210
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:21,140
We should do this more.

211
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:22,650
Yeah. In.

212
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:34,660
You okay?

213
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,540
Yeah.

216
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:35,390
Fuck.

217
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:38,560
Joel, what the fuck?

218
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:41,140
Exactly. What the fuck?

219
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:42,980
- Get outta here. - No, wait.

220
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:46,020
What-- what are you even doing here? You're supposed to be on patrol.

221
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:49,110
I came home early to surprise you for your birthday.

222
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:50,440
Oh, yeah. 

223
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:51,900
Seventeen, by the way.

224
00:24:52,530 --> 00:24:54,320
Well, I'm 19, so.

225
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,370
I'm gonna go.

226
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:01,120
Fuck is that?

227
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,290
Fuck.

228
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:07,130
It's not done yet, it's gonna look better when I fill in--

229
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:08,750
- Leave. - Right.

230
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:21,560
So, all the teenage shit all at once, huh?

231
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:26,480
Drugs, and tattoos, and sex.

232
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:29,810
Experimenting with girls?

233
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:33,780
It wasn't sex, and it wasn't a fucking experiment.

234
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:38,280
You don't know what you're sayin'.

235
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:41,830
We'll discuss this later, when you're yourself.

236
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:35,210
- The hell are you doing? - Moving into the garage.

237
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:37,510
The hell you are. Ellie, let go.

238
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:41,800
It's the middle of the night. It's pissin' rain out there. Now, get this back on the bed.

239
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:44,510
There's no heat or running water in the garage. You can't stay there.

240
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,890
Okay, fine.

241
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:49,770
Okay, you want to have this conversation? Fine.

242
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,520
You may not like the rules, but this is my house.

243
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:56,360
No, it isn't. You don't own it. They gave it to you.

244
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,150
Sorry, to us.

245
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,990
You don't own anything.

246
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,040
Look, I'm sorry that I got a tattoo,

247
00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:16,380
and smoked weed, and fooled around with a girl.

248
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:19,510
Except, I'm not.

249
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:23,800
Maybe...

250
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:30,480
Maybe it's a good thing for you to have your own space.

251
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:36,440
Just give me a few days and let me fix things up a little out there.

252
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:39,610
Okay.

253
00:27:43,410 --> 00:27:44,410
Come on.

254
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:02,430
Thanks.

255
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:03,550
Sure.

256
00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:08,010
Can I see?

257
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,610
- Did it hurt? - Yeah.

258
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:20,490
But kinda good.

259
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:25,620
It's actually not bad.

260
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:31,290
Better than the one I made on your guitar anyway.

261
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:39,210
I never did ask. What is it with the moths?

262
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:43,720
Nothing. Just--

263
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:46,640
I just read about them in a book on dreams and stuff.

264
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:48,850
It's kind of symbolic.

265
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:50,140
Oh, right.

266
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:54,190
Yeah, like change and growin' and such.

268
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:02,400
It's late.

269
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:04,200
Yeah.

270
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:06,990
Well, good night.

271
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,160
Night.

273
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:29,510
Hey.

274
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:35,850
You guys study dreams and stuff, right?

275
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:40,900
Is there a "Doctor Is In" sign on me like Lucy from fuckin' Peanuts?

276
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:49,620
Yes, some doctors studied dreams. The dumb ones, mostly.

277
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:50,910
So, a moth.

278
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:55,250
That probably means change and growth?

279
00:29:55,910 --> 00:29:57,710
No, that would be a butterfly.

280
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:00,790
So, what's a moth?

281
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:01,920
Death.

282
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:04,840
If you believe in that shit.

283
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:15,730
Why?

287
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:21,540
Okay, so I've been thinking,

288
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:25,130
or wondering-- no, thinking for a while now

289
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:30,340
about Salt Lake City.

290
00:31:32,010 --> 00:31:33,800
I just want to understand it.

291
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:38,470
So, I wrote down some questions.

292
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:40,980
Okay?

293
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:44,230
Okay.

294
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:54,120
One, 

295
00:31:54,910 --> 00:31:57,870
if the Fireflies spotted us a mile from the hospital,

296
00:31:58,450 --> 00:32:01,710
how did they get surprised by an entire group of Raiders?

297
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:06,290
Two.

298
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:11,760
If the Raiders could kill all those soldiers, and Marlene, 

299
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:15,470
and you had to carry me the whole time, how did we get away?

300
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:17,720
Three, 

301
00:32:17,850 --> 00:32:21,230
if there are dozens of immune people, why hasn't anyone heard--

302
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:24,980
Ellie?

303
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:27,900
Coming.

304
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,370
Already dressed.

305
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,870
I figured I'd be waking you up.

306
00:32:39,330 --> 00:32:41,200
Nope. I had trouble sleeping.

307
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:45,790
Well, guess what? That works out great for your birthday present.

308
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:48,380
You're 19 and you've been patient.

309
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:51,210
So, I told 'em I was okay with it.

310
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:52,420
With what?

311
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:53,840
Your first patrol.

312
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,510
- I'll grab my coat. - And a gun.

313
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:14,490
So, what's the record for number of kills on a training run?

314
00:33:14,610 --> 00:33:19,200
Zero. This is the safest trail we got. Gotta start easy.

315
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:20,870
Great. Happy birthday to me.

316
00:33:21,910 --> 00:33:23,330
Come on, binoculars. 

317
00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:24,870
Why? There's nothing out here.

318
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,250
I know, but this is about learnin' the ropes.

319
00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:30,090
So, pretend, okay?

320
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:33,510
It's part of the rules. 

321
00:33:33,630 --> 00:33:36,260
You stick with your partner,

322
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:37,970
scan the countryside, be ready for anything.

323
00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:39,470
- Oh, shit. - What?

324
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:43,850
There's a little squirrel fucking a big squirrel!

325
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:46,100
We should probably report that.

326
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:50,520
Fine, we'll skip the scannin' for now.

327
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,450
But this is nice, right?

328
00:33:56,990 --> 00:33:59,950
Reminds me of the old days, just you and me on the trail.

329
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:02,290
I know you got stuff going on, but it'd be nice

330
00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:05,460
if we could do this kind of thing more often.

331
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:06,870
Spend time together.

332
00:34:10,170 --> 00:34:11,170
Yeah.

333
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,680
- You okay? - Yeah.

334
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:18,840
It's just, you look... 

335
00:34:18,970 --> 00:34:20,470
- No, I-- - There's nothin' on your mind? 

336
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,970
- No, nothing. - Cache Creek, this is Jackson. Come in.

337
00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:28,100
Go for Cache Creek.

338
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:29,690
Infected north of Pinnacle.

339
00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:32,610
Eugene and Adam need backup. You're the closest we've got.

340
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:36,150
I'll be there in ten. Tell them to dig in.

341
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,610
- Go back to Jackson. - No.

342
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:39,320
Ellie, it's not safe. Go back.

343
00:34:39,450 --> 00:34:43,200
I'm not your fucking kid, Joel. I'm your partner. We stick together.

345
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:19,320
We'll hike down from here. Faster than the switchback.

346
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,070
You remember what I taught you?

347
00:35:58,190 --> 00:35:59,940
I'm your back. You're mine.

348
00:36:35,650 --> 00:36:36,770
Come on.

349
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:06,470
Oh, shit. Eugene.

350
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:08,260
Ellie.

351
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:14,560
You clean?

352
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:20,570
No.

353
00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:26,530
- Are there any more? - Joel.

354
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:28,700
Are there any more?

355
00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:30,990
Other than me?

356
00:37:34,370 --> 00:37:35,370
No.

357
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:43,170
Okay, okay. Look. Please, I figure I got about an hour.

358
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:45,930
So, this is what we do. We go back to the gate.

359
00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:48,220
They let Gail out, 

360
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:52,810
keeping her at a safe distance, of course. And I say

361
00:37:53,850 --> 00:37:54,850
goodbye.

362
00:37:56,690 --> 00:37:57,810
We can't do that.

363
00:37:58,850 --> 00:38:00,520
Yes, we can.

364
00:38:04,990 --> 00:38:06,320
Yes, we can.

365
00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:07,990
You're empty.

366
00:38:12,330 --> 00:38:13,330
No.

367
00:38:13,870 --> 00:38:16,460
Joel, I gotta go back. I gotta see her.

368
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:20,170
I got things I gotta tell her.

369
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:23,750
Things.

370
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:26,590
- You don't understand. - I do.

371
00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:30,180
- But we have rules, and it can't happen. - Wait.

372
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:35,680
Hold out your hand.

373
00:38:42,110 --> 00:38:43,480
Hold out your hand.

374
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:49,700
Now, count slowly, clearly, from one to ten.

375
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:56,830
One, two, three, four, five,

376
00:38:57,620 --> 00:39:03,000
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

377
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:07,090
He has time. We tie him up and we bring him back.

378
00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:11,720
Joel, let him see his fucking wife.

379
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:14,180
Please.

380
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:24,070
Get the horses, bring them down the trail.

381
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:26,360
I'll start walkin' with him, we'll meet up with you.

382
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:40,660
I promise.

383
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:51,930
Go ahead, ten feet.

384
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:54,180
Thank you.

385
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:24,790
It makes you cold. The Cordyceps.

386
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:28,130
I didn't expect that.

387
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:35,590
Which way?

388
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:40,140
Head right.

389
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:01,330
It's beautiful.

390
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:14,180
I need you to not turn around.

391
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:17,800
No. You can't--

392
00:41:18,470 --> 00:41:19,890
you can't do this to me.

393
00:41:20,970 --> 00:41:21,970
Joel.

394
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:25,100
If you have last words for her, I'll pass them along.

395
00:41:25,230 --> 00:41:26,980
Last words for her?

396
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:29,060
No, no, I need...

397
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:31,730
I need her last words!

398
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:33,900
For me!

399
00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:37,870
I'm dying.

400
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:40,830
I'm terrified. I...

401
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:47,960
I don't need a view.

402
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:52,670
I need Gail.

403
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:57,300
To see her face. Please.

404
00:41:58,430 --> 00:42:00,930
Please let that be the last thing I see.

405
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:07,900
If you love someone,

406
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:12,610
you can always see their face.

407
00:42:49,850 --> 00:42:51,110
I see her.

408
00:43:45,330 --> 00:43:46,410
I'm sorry.

409
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,770
I'm gonna radio ahead and let them know.

410
00:44:12,940 --> 00:44:14,480
When we get there, I'll tell Gail what she needs to know, and nothin' more.

412
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:22,820
It's the right thing to do.

413
00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:27,620
Ellie.

414
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:33,420
I had no choice.

415
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,040
He was bit when we found him.

416
00:45:19,710 --> 00:45:20,710
And...

417
00:45:22,670 --> 00:45:24,880
Well, he wanted to tell you that he loved you.

418
00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:31,890
And he wished he could say goodbye to you in person

419
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:34,350
but he didn't wanna put you in danger. No, no.

420
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:37,400
And he wasn't scared. 

421
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:38,980
He...

422
00:45:39,730 --> 00:45:41,110
He was brave.

423
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:45,950
And he ended it himself.

424
00:45:59,330 --> 00:46:00,840
That's not what happened.

425
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:07,760
He begged to see you. 

426
00:46:08,550 --> 00:46:09,720
He had time.

427
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:12,060
Joel promised to take him to you.

428
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:14,220
He promised us both.

429
00:46:17,190 --> 00:46:19,440
And then, Joel shot him in the head.

430
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:39,670
Get away. Please. Get away from me, please.

431
00:46:46,050 --> 00:46:47,340
You swore.

433
00:46:55,930 --> 00:46:57,390
No.

436
00:47:48,530 --> 00:47:49,900
That was good, yeah?

437
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:55,490
Oh, okay. Yeah, he's fallin' apart. I'm gonna get him to bed.

438
00:47:55,620 --> 00:47:56,950
You're gonna miss the countdown. 

439
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:59,830
- I'll come back after. - Okay. The next one is a little slower.

440
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:01,210
Save me some of that.

441
00:48:01,870 --> 00:48:04,840
- Say goodnight to Uncle Grumpy. - Goodnight, Uncle Grumpy.

442
00:48:05,750 --> 00:48:07,000
Night, kiddo.

443
00:48:07,130 --> 00:48:08,380
See you next year.

444
00:48:09,010 --> 00:48:10,090
See you next year.

445
00:48:20,730 --> 00:48:21,810
You okay?

446
00:48:24,150 --> 00:48:25,310
Yeah, I'm fine.

447
00:48:27,230 --> 00:48:29,320
What I said today about you being a refugee

448
00:48:30,190 --> 00:48:32,740
- probably came off as ungrateful. - No, it's okay.

449
00:48:32,860 --> 00:48:34,910
Well, I am grateful.

450
00:48:35,820 --> 00:48:39,750
You mean a lot to us. To all of us. But especially to me and Tommy.

451
00:48:40,410 --> 00:48:44,290
What I'm trying to say is, Uncle Grumpy is family.

452
00:48:45,170 --> 00:48:48,670
And family helps each other out, if you need it.

453
00:48:52,170 --> 00:48:53,380
Hey, 

454
00:48:53,510 --> 00:48:54,760
it's a family event.

455
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:56,850
Sorry.

456
00:48:58,930 --> 00:48:59,930
Sorry.

457
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:03,020
In a church. Dykes.

458
00:49:03,140 --> 00:49:05,770
- Fuck did you just say? - Ellie, no. Ellie, hey. No.

459
00:49:07,940 --> 00:49:09,400
You get the hell out of here.

460
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:11,570
Seth. Let's...

461
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:15,700
Let's take a walk. Come on. 

462
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:16,820
Let's go.

463
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:20,080
Are you okay?

464
00:49:21,370 --> 00:49:22,830
What is wrong with you?

465
00:49:26,750 --> 00:49:29,380
I don't need your fucking help.

466
00:49:38,050 --> 00:49:39,050
Right.

467
00:51:44,510 --> 00:51:45,680
What are you drinking?

468
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:48,640
Coffee.

469
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:50,690
Where'd you get it?

470
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:55,190
The people that came through last week.

471
00:51:56,860 --> 00:52:00,150
I'm a little embarrassed for what I traded to get it, but...

472
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:02,700
it's not bad.

473
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:14,880
I had Seth under control.

474
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:18,460
Yeah, I know.

475
00:52:19,630 --> 00:52:22,630
And I don't wanna ever hear about you taking me off patrol again.

476
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:26,220
Okay.

477
00:52:34,060 --> 00:52:35,230
So, Dina.

478
00:52:37,940 --> 00:52:39,570
Is she your girlfriend now?

479
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:42,610
No. No, she...

480
00:52:44,740 --> 00:52:47,660
It was just one kiss. Didn't mean anything.

481
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:51,580
I don't know why she did that.

482
00:52:54,170 --> 00:52:55,170
But...

483
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,170
you do like her?

484
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:04,630
I'm so stupid.

485
00:53:08,470 --> 00:53:11,270
Look, I don't know what Dina's intentions are, but...

486
00:53:15,190 --> 00:53:16,810
well, she'd be lucky to have you.

487
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:22,190
You're such an asshole.

488
00:53:27,660 --> 00:53:28,990
You lied to me.

489
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:33,160
You looked me in the eyes and you lied, 

490
00:53:33,290 --> 00:53:35,170
and it was the same face.

491
00:53:36,290 --> 00:53:38,460
Same fucking look.

492
00:53:43,170 --> 00:53:44,930
But I think I knew already.

493
00:53:47,390 --> 00:53:49,220
I knew this whole time.

494
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:57,730
So, I'm gonna give you one last chance.

495
00:53:59,860 --> 00:54:02,070
Tell me what happened with the Fireflies.

496
00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:06,490
If you lie to me again, we're done.

497
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:18,000
Were there other immune people?

498
00:54:33,850 --> 00:54:35,270
Were there Raiders?

499
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:46,530
Could they have made a cure?

500
00:55:08,300 --> 00:55:09,340
Did you--

501
00:55:16,180 --> 00:55:17,480
And Marlene?

502
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:28,280
Making a cure

503
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:32,410
would've killed you.

504
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:37,580
Then, I was supposed to die. That was my purpose. 

505
00:55:37,700 --> 00:55:40,960
My life would have fucking mattered! But you took that from me!

506
00:55:41,790 --> 00:55:43,460
You took it from everyone.

507
00:55:45,590 --> 00:55:46,590
Yes.

508
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:51,180
And I'll pay the price

509
00:55:52,890 --> 00:55:55,060
because you're gonna turn away from me.

510
00:56:00,020 --> 00:56:03,190
But if somehow I had a second chance at that moment,

511
00:56:06,860 --> 00:56:08,570
I would do it all over again.

512
00:56:11,610 --> 00:56:13,490
Because you're selfish.

513
00:56:14,910 --> 00:56:16,330
Because I love you.

514
00:56:22,670 --> 00:56:23,750
In a way you...

515
00:56:25,460 --> 00:56:27,170
you can't understand.

516
00:56:30,670 --> 00:56:32,010
Maybe you never will.

517
00:56:35,510 --> 00:56:37,310
But if that day should come,

518
00:56:39,970 --> 00:56:42,060
if you should ever have one of your own,

519
00:56:48,690 --> 00:56:49,730
well, then...

520
00:56:53,950 --> 00:56:55,910
I hope you do a little better than me.

521
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:15,890
I don't think I can forgive you for this.

522
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:27,230
But I would like to try.
