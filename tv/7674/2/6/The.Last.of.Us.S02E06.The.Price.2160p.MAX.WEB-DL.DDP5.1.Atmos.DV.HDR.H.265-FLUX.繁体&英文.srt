1
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:11,170
沒事的
It'll be fine.

2
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:15,180
- 他會打死我的 - 我說了 沒事的
- He's gonna beat the shit outta me. - I said, it'll be fine.

3
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:18,220
我要挨一頓皮帶了
I'm gonna get the belt.

4
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:19,350
不會的
No, you're not.

5
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:21,770
我來挨
I will.

6
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:27,310
回你房間去 別出來
Just go to your room, and stay there.

(得克薩斯州奧斯汀 1983年)

8
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:02,890
(J米勒)

9
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:10,320
我30分鐘后要回去巡邏 有話快說 出什么事了
I'm back on patrol in 30 minutes. So, talk fast. What happened?

10
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:13,030
你已經知道了
You know what happened.

11
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:15,150
可我想聽你親口說
Yeah, well, I wanna hear it from you.

12
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:20,410
我從一個孩子那里買大麻
I was buying pot from this other kid.

13
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:22,620
他想敲詐我 我們打了起來
He tried to rip me off, and we got into a fight.

14
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:27,040
- 你打算這么說 好吧 - 我說的是實話
- That's what you're going with? Okay. - I'm telling the truth.

15
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:28,750
不 這不是
No. No, you're not.

16
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:31,460
我覺得買毒品的是湯米 不是你
I think Tommy was buying the drugs, not you.

17
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:34,880
你只是恰好路過 看到他被敲詐 就動手打人了
I think you happened to walk by, saw what was going on, and started punching. 

18
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:37,510
- 湯米沒有... - 喬爾 我問過你打的那小子了
- Tommy didn't do anyth-- - I talked to the kid you beat up, Joel,

19
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:40,390
還有被叫到現場的警察 我不是傻子
and the officers who got called to the scene. I'm not stupid.

20
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,850
假如你和湯米不是我兒子 你們現在都得進少管所
And if you and Tommy weren't my sons, you'd both be in juvie right now.

21
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:49,400
你不會傷害他的
You're not gonna hurt him.

22
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:27,100
我跟你說過我偷糖果的事情嗎
Did I ever tell you about that time I stole a candy bar?

23
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:31,560
那年我十歲
I was ten.

24
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:34,900
你爺爺發現了
Grandpa found out, 

25
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:37,780
讓我把糖還回去 還讓我跟收銀員道歉
made me give it back, made me apologize to the cashier.

26
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:40,740
然后我們回家了
And then, we went home.

27
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:44,330
就在我下車之前 他...
Just before I got out of the car, man, he just...

28
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:47,450
他打碎了我的下巴
He broke my jaw. 

29
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:49,960
到處都是血
There was blood everywhere.

30
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:52,080
你奶奶以為我死了
Grandma thought I was dead.

31
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:56,920
我的嘴被鋼絲固定了兩個月
My mouth was wired shut for two months.

32
00:02:58,170 --> 00:02:59,970
弄得人盡皆知
Everybody knew why. 

33
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:02,510
丟死人了
It was humiliating.

34
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:06,640
既然你知道那種感覺 為什么還打我們
If you know what it feels like, then why?

35
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,230
我告訴你這個故事不是為了同情你們
That's not why I'm telling you this.

36
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:14,690
沒錯 我打過你 也打過湯米
Okay, yeah, I've hit you. And I've hit Tommy.

37
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:19,320
但從來沒有那么狠
But never like that.

38
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,650
差得遠了
Not even close.

39
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:23,700
也許我太過分了 我...
I mean, maybe I go too far, I...

40
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:26,580
我不知道 我只是...
I don't know, I just...

41
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:29,910
我不知道
I don't know.

42
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,790
但我比我父親稍好一點
But I'm doing a little better than my father did.

43
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:43,800
將來你做父親的時候...
And you know, when it's your turn,

44
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:49,060
希望你能比我稍好一點
I hope you do a little better than me.

45

我的孫輩們會喜歡的 你怎么找到的
My grandkids are gonna love these. How'd you find 'em?

51
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:08,400
我搜了霍貝克那邊的老房子
Searched the old homes out by Hoback.

52
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,490
我早就搜過了
I searched those homes.

53
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,620
我知道去哪里找 因為我是走私販 而你是...
Well, I know where to look 'cause I'm a smuggler, and you're a...

54
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:16,910
我以前不干這一行
I wasn't always this.

交易就是交易

00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:39,440
我們可以準備好你要的東西 交貨日是...

00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:35,640
- 怎么了  - 你從哪冒出來的

00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:43,270
湯米 怎么回事

00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:45,730
她做伙食雜務的時候燙傷了手臂

70
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:46,940
怎么燙的

00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:50,900
- 我把手臂貼到鍋上了 - 你是故意的
- I pushed it right up against a pot. - You did this on purpose?

72
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:54,360
我心想“來吧” 然后就行動了
I was like, "Here we go," and then I fucking went.

73
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:55,860
什么 為什么
What? Why?

74
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:58,160
沒人看見 當時就我一個人
No one saw. I was on my own.

75
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:01,950
燙完之后 它變得紅腫軟塌 可惡心了
And I took it off and it was all red and melting and gross.

76
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,580
你知道有一股什么味兒嗎 豬肉
You know what it smelled like? Pork.

77
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:07,290
- 誰允許她這么干的  - 什么叫“允許”
- Who let this happen? - What do you mean, "let"?

78
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:09,500

對不起 真對不起
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

86
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,480
沒關系
It's okay.

87
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,400
沒關系 你沒事了
It's okay. You're okay.

00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,800
對了
Oh, right.

00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:47,930
你等著 我還有東西要給你 閉上眼睛
Stay right there. I got somethin' else for you. Close your eyes.

96
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:51,650
別睜開
Keep 'em closed.

97
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:55,900
好了 轉過來
Okay, turn toward me.

98
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,570
睜開眼睛
And, open.

99
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,910
- 這是什么  - 有人管這個叫吉他
- What's this? - Some folks call this a "gee-tar."

100
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:11,040
我借了你的一幅畫來尋找靈感
I borrowed one of your drawings for inspiration.

101
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:16,170
我花時間修過了 這是真骨琴橋
Took a bit of restorin'. Real bone saddle here.

102

Lacquered the whole body and used a Dremel to carve the...

103
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:23,550
就是那種旋轉的小鉆機 換個頭還能當鋸子用
Well, that's a rotary drill. Or could be a saw, dependin' on the tip.

104
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,720
挺萬能的一種工具
But, actually, it's a pretty versatile tool.

105
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,480
總之...
Anyway.

一鍋
A "lotter"?

125
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:35,620
你是說一窩嗎
You mean a litter?

126
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:37,620
一窩小貓 真的嗎
A litter of kittens? Really?

127
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,330
既是真的 又不是真的

Don't get me wrong. I love counting vegetables and shoveling sheep shit.

137
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:08,110
我只是覺得我在墻外更有用處
I'm just saying, I think I could be more useful outside the wall.

138
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,990
你早晚是要巡邏的 現在就好好享受當小孩的時光吧
You'll get on patrols eventually. You should enjoy being a kid for now.

139
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,870
因為到目前為止 童年一直帶給我無盡的快樂
Oh, because childhood has been such a joy for me so far.

140
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:18,330
你四小時前才剛滿16歲
You've been 16 all of four hours.

141
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:20,410
在你完成訓練之前 我們不會派你出去的
We're not sending you out until you're trained.

142
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:23,130
你需要一種叫做“耐心”的東西
You're gonna need somethin' called patience.

143
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:24,840
杰西說如果你愿意 他可以訓練我
Jesse said he'd train me if you let him.

144
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,760
你們兩個之間有什么嗎
Is there somethin' going on between you two?

145
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:31,590
- 你說什么  - 你們經常在一起
- Excuse me? - You spend a lot of time together.

146
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:34,260
這好笑嗎
Is it funny?

147
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:38,640
我看到你看他的眼神了 我看這種東西很準的
I see the way you look at him. I got a keen eye for these sort of things.

148
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:41,350
- 我不信 - 好吧 不關我的事
- I don't think you do. - Alright, none of my business.

149
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:44,440
但是有人跟你談過性教育嗎
But has anyone talked to you about the birds and the bees?

150
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,690
你是說雞巴和陰道嗎
You mean dicks and vaginas?

151
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:49,110
- 天啊 - 這樣吧
- Jesus. - I tell you what.

152
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:52,780
只要你讓我接受巡邏訓練 我就保證我不會懷孕
I promise you, I won't get pregnant if you let me train for patrols. Deal?

153
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:55,490
- 成交  - 我盡量
I'll see what I can do.

154
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:57,370
還要走多遠啊
Okay, how much longer, man?

155
00:15:58,620 --> 00:15:59,620
到了
We're here.

156
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:14,220
天啊 真的是恐龍
Oh, my God. It is a dinosaur!

157
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,840
- 喬爾  - 喜歡嗎
- Joel! - Like it?

158
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:19,060
看來是喜歡了
Yeah. Likes it.

159
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:28,230
艾莉
Ellie.

160
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:30,030
艾莉
Ellie!

161
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:33,280
天啊
Oh, my God. 

162
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,240
小心
Careful.

163
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:39,540
我騎上他媽的恐龍了
I'm on a motherfucking dinosaur!

164
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:44,250
- 喬爾 那里有座博物館  - 我知道
- Joel, there's a museum! - Yeah, I know!

165
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:47,380
你要是不從霸王龍上摔下來 我就帶你去
If you don't fall off the goddamn T-Rex, I'll take you there.

166
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,850
這太酷了
This is so cool.

167
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:03,270
你知道這個地方多久了
How long have you known about this place?

168
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:04,390
有一陣子了
A while.

169
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:06,650
那你怎么不說
Well, then what the fuck?

170
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,570
我想找個特殊的日子告訴你
I was saving it for a special day.

171
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:10,730
看吧
You see? 

172
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:14,450
- 這叫耐心 - 對 我聽說過
- Patience. - Oh, yeah, I've heard of that.

173
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,730
(穿越星空)

174
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:51,610
還轉得動嗎
It works?

175
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:53,440
一定有人上過油了
Somebody must have greased it.

176
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,330
你能想象身處太空的感覺嗎
Can you imagine being up there?

177
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:09,000
- 你想試試嗎  - 試什么
- Would you like to? - Like to what?

178

上太空
Go to space?

179
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,560
這是真的嗎
Is it real?

180
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:33,190
是 那個真的去過太空
It's real. That one went up and back.

好了
You got it.

184
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:13,150
你要上太空了 總要有頭盔吧
You're going up to space. You need a helmet.

185
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:22,490
選一個
Pick one.

186
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,950
- 里面的氣味怎么樣  - 有太空的味道

187
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:08,950
還有灰塵
and dust.

188
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:11,210
很好 那你準備好了

00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,960
是我千辛萬苦才找到的東西

194

放來聽聽

195
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:20,940
閉上眼睛
Close your eyes.

196
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,400
很值得

I do okay?

208
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,490
開什么玩笑
Are you kidding me?

209
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:17,850
這樣真好
This is nice.

210
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:21,140
我們應該經常來
We should do this more.

對 我贊成
Yeah. In.

212
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:34,660

喬爾 搞什么
Joel, what the fuck?

218
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:41,140
我還想問你呢 搞什么
Exactly. What the fuck?

219
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:42,980
- 出去 - 不 等等
- Get outta here. - No, wait.

220
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:46,020
你怎么來了 你不是去巡邏了嗎
What-- what are you even doing here? You're supposed to be on patrol.

221
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:49,110
我故意提前回家 想給你個生日驚喜
I came home early to surprise you for your birthday.

222
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:50,440
天啊
Oh, yeah. 

223
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:51,900
對了 你才17歲
Seventeen, by the way.

224
00:24:52,530 --> 00:24:54,320
我19歲了 所以...

225
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,370
我要走了
I'm gonna go.

226
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:01,120
那是什么鬼東西
Fuck is that?

227
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,290
該死...
Fuck.

228
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:07,130

It's not done yet, it's gonna look better when I fill in--

229
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:08,750
- 快走 - 好
- Leave. - Right.

230
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:21,560
所有的青春期問題一下子全來了

毒品 紋身 性愛

還和女孩一起探索
Experimenting with girls?

233
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:33,780
那不是性愛 也不是狗屁探索
It wasn't sex, and it wasn't a fucking experiment.

234
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:38,280
你根本不知道你在說什么
You don't know what you're sayin'.

235
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:41,830
等你清醒了 我們再討論這個
We'll discuss this later, when you're yourself.

236
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:35,210
- 你在干什么  - 搬進車庫
- The hell are you doing? - Moving into the garage.

237
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:37,510
想都別想 艾莉 放手
The hell you are. Ellie, let go.

238
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:41,800
現在是半夜 外面下著大雨 把這個放回床上
It's the middle of the night. It's pissin' rain out there. Now, get this back on the bed.

239
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:44,510
車庫里沒有暖氣和自來水 你不能住進去
There's no heat or running water in the garage. You can't stay there.

240
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,890
好吧
Okay, fine.

241
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:49,770
你非要跟我說清楚 好吧
Okay, you want to have this conversation? Fine.

242
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,520
你可能不喜歡這里的規矩 但這是我家
You may not like the rules, but this is my house.

243
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:56,360
才不是 你不是這里的主人 這是他們給你的
No, it isn't. You don't own it. They gave it to you.

244
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,150
不 是給我們的
Sorry, to us.

245
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,990
其實你一無所有
You don't own anything.

246
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,040
很抱歉 我紋了紋身
Look, I'm sorry that I got a tattoo,

247
00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:16,380
抽了大麻 還和一個女孩鬼混
and smoked weed, and fooled around with a girl.

248
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:19,510
只不過 我的道歉是假的
Except, I'm not.

249
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:23,800
也許...
Maybe...

250
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:30,480
也許你應該有自己的空間了
Maybe it's a good thing for you to have your own space.

251
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:36,440
給我幾天時間修繕一下車庫吧
Just give me a few days and let me fix things up a little out there.

252
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:39,610
好
Okay.

253
00:27:43,410 --> 00:27:44,410
來吧
Come on.

254
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:02,430
謝謝
Thanks.

255
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:03,550
不客氣
Sure.

256
00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:08,010
我能看看嗎
Can I see?

257
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,610
- 疼嗎  - 疼
- Did it hurt? - Yeah.

258
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:20,490
但是挺好看的
But kinda good.

259
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:25,620
確實還不錯
It's actually not bad.

260
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:31,290
至少比我在你吉他上刻的那個好
Better than the one I made on your guitar anyway.

261
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:39,210
我都沒問過 你為什么喜歡飛蛾
I never did ask. What is it with the moths?

262
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:43,720
沒什么
Nothing. Just--

263
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:46,640
我在一本關于夢境的書里看到過
I just read about them in a book on dreams and stuff.

264
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:48,850
有點象征意義
It's kind of symbolic.

265
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:50,140
對
Oh, right.

266
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:54,190
它代表改變和...
Yeah, like change and growin' and such.

267
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,810
成長之類的

268
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:02,400
很晚了
It's late.

269
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:04,200
對
Yeah.

270
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:06,990
晚安
Well, good night.

271
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,160
晚安
Night.

272
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:21,920
(“大地永存”)

273
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:29,510
嘿
Hey.

274
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:35,850
你們研究夢境什么的 對吧
You guys study dreams and stuff, right?

275
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:40,900
我身上有“醫生在此”的標志嗎  就像“花生”漫畫里的露西
Is there a "Doctor Is In" sign on me like Lucy from fuckin' Peanuts?

276
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:49,620
沒錯 有些醫生研究夢境 但大多是蠢醫生
Yes, some doctors studied dreams. The dumb ones, mostly.

277
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:50,910
飛蛾
So, a moth.

278
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:55,250
可能意味著改變和成長吧
That probably means change and growth?

279
00:29:55,910 --> 00:29:57,710
不 那是蝴蝶
No, that would be a butterfly.

280
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:00,790
那飛蛾代表什么
So, what's a moth?

281
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:01,920
死亡
Death.

282
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:04,840
如果你相信那鬼東西的話
If you believe in that shit.

283
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:15,730
為什么問這個
Why?

284
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:42,840
(贊菲爾 “孤獨的牧羊人”)

285
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:04,020
(你有更偉大的使命)

286
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:13,370
(兩年后)

287
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:21,540
這段時間 我一直在思考...
Okay, so I've been thinking,

288
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:25,130
或者好奇 不 是思考
or wondering-- no, thinking for a while now

289
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:30,340
鹽湖城的事
about Salt Lake City.

290
00:31:32,010 --> 00:31:33,800
我只是想弄明白
I just want to understand it.

291
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:38,470
所以我羅列了一些問題
So, I wrote down some questions.

292
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:40,980
好嗎
Okay?

293
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:44,230
好
Okay.

294
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:54,120
“第一”
One, 

295
00:31:54,910 --> 00:31:57,870
“如果火螢在離醫院一英里的地方 發現了我們”
if the Fireflies spotted us a mile from the hospital,

296
00:31:58,450 --> 00:32:01,710
“他們怎么會 被一整群掠奪者突襲 ”
how did they get surprised by an entire group of Raiders?

297
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:06,290
“第二”
Two.

298
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:11,760
“如果掠奪者有本事 殺死所有士兵和瑪琳”
If the Raiders could kill all those soldiers, and Marlene, 

299
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:15,470
“而你一直背著我 我們是怎么逃出來的 ”
and you had to carry me the whole time, how did we get away?

300
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:17,720
“第三”
Three, 

301
00:32:17,850 --> 00:32:21,230
“如果有幾十個免疫者 為什么沒人聽說...”
if there are dozens of immune people, why hasn't anyone heard--

302
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:24,980
艾莉
Ellie?

303
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:27,900
來了
Coming.

304
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,370
你已經穿好衣服了
Already dressed.

305
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,870
我以為我會吵醒你
I figured I'd be waking you up.

306
00:32:39,330 --> 00:32:41,200
沒有 我睡不著
Nope. I had trouble sleeping.

307
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:45,790
你猜怎么著  這作為你的生日禮物再合適不過了
Well, guess what? That works out great for your birthday present.

308
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:48,380
你19歲了 一直很有耐心
You're 19 and you've been patient.

309
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:51,210
所以我告訴他們我同意了
So, I told 'em I was okay with it.

310
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:52,420
同意什么
With what?

311
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:53,840
你第一次巡邏
Your first patrol.

312
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,510
- 我去拿外套 - 還有槍
- I'll grab my coat. - And a gun.

313
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:14,490
實習巡邏的擊殺紀錄是多少
So, what's the record for number of kills on a training run?

314
00:33:14,610 --> 00:33:19,200
零 這是目前最安全的路徑 得從簡單的開始
Zero. This is the safest trail we got. Gotta start easy.

315
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:20,870
很好 祝我生日快樂
Great. Happy birthday to me.

316
00:33:21,910 --> 00:33:23,330
把望遠鏡拿出來
Come on, binoculars. 

317
00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:24,870
為什么 這里什么都沒有
Why? There's nothing out here.

318
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,250
我知道 但這是為了熟悉流程
I know, but this is about learnin' the ropes.

319
00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:30,090
假裝一下 好嗎
So, pretend, okay?

320
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:33,510
這是規定
It's part of the rules. 

321
00:33:33,630 --> 00:33:36,260
跟緊你的搭檔 搜索郊區
You stick with your partner,

322
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:37,970
隨時做好一切準備
scan the countryside, be ready for anything.

323
00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:39,470
- 該死  - 怎么了
- Oh, shit. - What?

324
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:43,850
有只小松鼠在操一只大松鼠
There's a little squirrel fucking a big squirrel!

325
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:46,100
也許應該匯報上去
We should probably report that.

326
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:50,520
好吧 暫時不要搜索了
Fine, we'll skip the scannin' for now.

327
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,450
這感覺挺好的 對吧
But this is nice, right?

328
00:33:56,990 --> 00:33:59,950
讓我想起了以前 只有咱倆在林間的日子
Reminds me of the old days, just you and me on the trail.

329
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:02,290
我知道你有事要忙
I know you got stuff going on, but it'd be nice

330
00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:05,460
但我們要是能經常這樣就好了
if we could do this kind of thing more often.

331
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:06,870
多花點時間相處
Spend time together.

332
00:34:10,170 --> 00:34:11,170
對
Yeah.

333
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,680
- 你沒事吧  - 沒事
- You okay? - Yeah.

334
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:18,840
可你看起來...
It's just, you look... 

335
00:34:18,970 --> 00:34:20,470
- 不 我只是... - 你沒心事嗎
- No, I-- - There's nothin' on your mind? 

336
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,970
- 沒有 - “卡什溪 這里是杰克遜”
- No, nothing. - Cache Creek, this is Jackson. Come in.

337
00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:28,100
這里是卡什溪
Go for Cache Creek.

338
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:29,690
“頂峰以北發現感染者”
Infected north of Pinnacle.

339
00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:32,610
“尤金和亞當需要支援 你們離那里最近”
Eugene and Adam need backup. You're the closest we've got.

340
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:36,150
我十分鐘后到 叫他們開始行動
I'll be there in ten. Tell them to dig in.

341
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,610
- 回杰克遜 - 不
- Go back to Jackson. - No.

342
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:39,320
艾莉 這里不安全 快回去
Ellie, it's not safe. Go back.

343
00:34:39,450 --> 00:34:43,200
我不是你的孩子 喬爾 我是你的搭檔 我們不能分開
I'm not your fucking kid, Joel. I'm your partner. We stick together.

344
00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:48,790
好吧

345
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:19,320
我們從這里走下去 比走彎道還快
We'll hike down from here. Faster than the switchback.

346
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,070
記得我教你的嗎
You remember what I taught you?

347
00:35:58,190 --> 00:35:59,940
我們互為后盾
I'm your back. You're mine.

348
00:36:35,650 --> 00:36:36,770
來吧
Come on.

349
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:06,470
該死 尤金
Oh, shit. Eugene.

350
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:08,260
艾莉
Ellie.

351
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:14,560
你被咬了嗎
You clean?

352
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:20,570
是的
No.

353
00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:26,530
- 還有感染者嗎  - 喬爾
- Are there any more? - Joel.

354
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:28,700
還有感染者嗎
Are there any more?

355
00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:30,990
除了我
Other than me?

356
00:37:34,370 --> 00:37:35,370
沒了
No.

357
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:43,170
好吧 聽著 我還能撐一個小時
Okay, okay. Look. Please, I figure I got about an hour.

358
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:45,930
這樣吧 我們回大門口去
So, this is what we do. We go back to the gate.

359
00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:48,220
讓他們放蓋爾出來
They let Gail out, 

360
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:52,810
讓她跟我保持安全距離 然后我...
keeping her at a safe distance, of course. And I say

361
00:37:53,850 --> 00:37:54,850
跟她道別
goodbye.

362
00:37:56,690 --> 00:37:57,810
我們不能那么做
We can't do that.

363
00:37:58,850 --> 00:38:00,520
當然能了
Yes, we can.

364
00:38:04,990 --> 00:38:06,320
必須能
Yes, we can.

365
00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:07,990
你沒子彈了
You're empty.

366
00:38:12,330 --> 00:38:13,330
不
No.

367
00:38:13,870 --> 00:38:16,460
喬爾 我得回去 我得見見她
Joel, I gotta go back. I gotta see her.

368
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:20,170
我有事情要告訴她
I got things I gotta tell her.

369
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:23,750
有些事
Things.

370
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:26,590
- 你不明白 - 我明白
- You don't understand. - I do.

371
00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:30,180
- 但規定不讓我們那么做 - 等等
- But we have rules, and it can't happen. - Wait.

372
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:35,680
把手伸出來
Hold out your hand.

373
00:38:42,110 --> 00:38:43,480
把手伸出來
Hold out your hand.

374
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:49,700
現在慢慢地從一數到十
Now, count slowly, clearly, from one to ten.

375
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:56,830
一 二 三 四 五...
One, two, three, four, five,

376
00:38:57,620 --> 00:39:03,000
六 七 八 九 十
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

377
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:07,090
他還有時間 我們把他綁回去 再把他帶回來
He has time. We tie him up and we bring him back.

378
00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:11,720
喬爾 讓他見他老婆一面吧
Joel, let him see his fucking wife.

379
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:14,180
求你了
Please.

380
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:24,070
沿著小路把馬牽下來
Get the horses, bring them down the trail.

381
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:26,360
我帶他往回走 我們在中途匯合
I'll start walkin' with him, we'll meet up with you.

382
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:40,660
我保證
I promise.

383
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:51,930
往前走 十英尺
Go ahead, ten feet.

384
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:54,180
謝謝
Thank you.

385
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:24,790
蟲草菌會讓人身上發冷
It makes you cold. The Cordyceps.

386
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:28,130
這我倒是沒想到
I didn't expect that.

387
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:35,590
走哪邊
Which way?

388
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:40,140
右邊
Head right.

389
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:01,330
真美啊
It's beautiful.

390
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:14,180
別回頭
I need you to not turn around.

391
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:17,800
不 你不能...
No. You can't--

392
00:41:18,470 --> 00:41:19,890
你不能這樣對我
you can't do this to me.

393
00:41:20,970 --> 00:41:21,970
喬爾
Joel.

394
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:25,100
如果你有什么遺言要對她說 我愿意幫你轉達
If you have last words for her, I'll pass them along.

395
00:41:25,230 --> 00:41:26,980
給她的遺言
Last words for her?

396
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:29,060
不 我要...
No, no, I need...

397
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:31,730
我要聽她說話
I need her last words!

398
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:33,900
說給我聽的
For me!

399
00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:37,870
我要死了
I'm dying.

400
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:40,830
我很害怕 我...
I'm terrified. I...

401
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:47,960
我不需要看風景
I don't need a view.

402
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:52,670
我需要的是蓋爾
I need Gail.

403
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:57,300
我得看到她的臉 求你了
To see her face. Please.

404
00:41:58,430 --> 00:42:00,930
求你讓我看著她的臉死去
Please let that be the last thing I see.

405
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:07,900
如果你愛一個人...
If you love someone,

406
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:12,610
你隨時可以看到他們的臉
you can always see their face.

407
00:42:49,850 --> 00:42:51,110
我看見她了
I see her.

408
00:43:45,330 --> 00:43:46,410
很遺憾
I'm sorry.

409
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,770
我先用無線電通知他們吧
I'm gonna radio ahead and let them know.

410
00:44:12,940 --> 00:44:14,480
等我們到了 我會...
When we get there, I'll tell Gail what she needs to know, and nothin' more.

411
00:44:15,770 --> 00:44:19,940
我會告訴蓋爾她需要知道的部分 僅此而已

412
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:22,820
這么做才對
It's the right thing to do.

413
00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:27,620
艾莉
Ellie.

414
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:33,420
我別無選擇
I had no choice.

415
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,040
我們找到他的時候 他已經被咬了
He was bit when we found him.

416
00:45:19,710 --> 00:45:20,710
然后...
And...

417
00:45:22,670 --> 00:45:24,880
他讓我轉告你 他愛你
Well, he wanted to tell you that he loved you.

418
00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:31,890
他希望能當面跟你道別
And he wished he could say goodbye to you in person

419
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:34,350
但他不想讓你有危險
but he didn't wanna put you in danger. No, no.

420
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:37,400
他并不害怕
And he wasn't scared. 

421
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:38,980
他...
He...

422
00:45:39,730 --> 00:45:41,110
他很勇敢
He was brave.

423
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:45,950
他親手結束了自己的生命
And he ended it himself.

424
00:45:59,330 --> 00:46:00,840
不是那樣的
That's not what happened.

425
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:07,760
他求著要見你
He begged to see you. 

426
00:46:08,550 --> 00:46:09,720
他來得及
He had time.

427
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:12,060
喬爾答應帶他來見你的
Joel promised to take him to you.

428
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:14,220
他答應了我們兩個
He promised us both.

429
00:46:17,190 --> 00:46:19,440
可是接著 喬爾朝他的頭開了一槍
And then, Joel shot him in the head.

430
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:39,670
走開 拜托 離我遠點 求你了
Get away. Please. Get away from me, please.

431
00:46:46,050 --> 00:46:47,340
你發過誓的
You swore.

432
00:46:49,970 --> 00:46:51,680
我不想...

433
00:46:55,930 --> 00:46:57,390
不
No.

434
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:02,360
為什么

435
00:47:11,030 --> 00:47:15,160
(九個月后)

436
00:47:48,530 --> 00:47:49,900
還不錯吧
That was good, yeah?

437
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:55,490
他快撐不住了 我要帶他去睡覺
Oh, okay. Yeah, he's fallin' apart. I'm gonna get him to bed.

438
00:47:55,620 --> 00:47:56,950
你會錯過新年倒計時的
You're gonna miss the countdown. 

439
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:59,830
- 我晚點再回來 - 這一首歌比較慢
- I'll come back after. - Okay. The next one is a little slower.

440
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:01,210
給我留點酒
Save me some of that.

441
00:48:01,870 --> 00:48:04,840
- 跟暴躁大伯說晚安 - 晚安 暴躁大伯
- Say goodnight to Uncle Grumpy. - Goodnight, Uncle Grumpy.

442
00:48:05,750 --> 00:48:07,000
晚安 孩子
Night, kiddo.

443
00:48:07,130 --> 00:48:08,380
明年見
See you next year.

444
00:48:09,010 --> 00:48:10,090
明年見
See you next year.

445
00:48:20,730 --> 00:48:21,810
你沒事吧
You okay?

446
00:48:24,150 --> 00:48:25,310
沒事
Yeah, I'm fine.

447
00:48:27,230 --> 00:48:29,320
我今天說你是難民...
What I said today about you being a refugee

448
00:48:30,190 --> 00:48:32,740
- 可能讓你覺得我不知感恩 - 不 沒關系
- probably came off as ungrateful. - No, it's okay.

449
00:48:32,860 --> 00:48:34,910
我很感激你
Well, I am grateful.

450
00:48:35,820 --> 00:48:39,750
你對我們所有人而言都很重要 但對我和湯米來說尤其重要
You mean a lot to us. To all of us. But especially to me and Tommy.

451
00:48:40,410 --> 00:48:44,290
我想說的是 暴躁大伯是我們的家人
What I'm trying to say is, Uncle Grumpy is family.

452
00:48:45,170 --> 00:48:48,670
只要你需要 家人之間會互相幫忙
And family helps each other out, if you need it.

453
00:48:52,170 --> 00:48:53,380
嘿
Hey, 

454
00:48:53,510 --> 00:48:54,760
這是家庭活動
it's a family event.

455
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:56,850
對不起
Sorry.

456
00:48:58,930 --> 00:48:59,930
對不起
Sorry.

457
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:03,020
這可是教堂 臭同性戀
In a church. Dykes.

458
00:49:03,140 --> 00:49:05,770
- 你他媽說什么  - 艾莉 別生氣 艾莉
- Fuck did you just say? - Ellie, no. Ellie, hey. No.

459
00:49:07,940 --> 00:49:09,400
滾出去
You get the hell out of here.

460
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:11,570
賽斯 我們...
Seth. Let's...

461
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:15,700
我們去走走 來
Let's take a walk. Come on. 

462
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:16,820
我們走
Let's go.

463
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:20,080
你沒事吧
Are you okay?

464
00:49:21,370 --> 00:49:22,830
你有什么毛病
What is wrong with you?

465
00:49:26,750 --> 00:49:29,380
我他媽不用你幫忙
I don't need your fucking help.

466
00:49:38,050 --> 00:49:39,050
好
Right.

467
00:51:44,510 --> 00:51:45,680
你在喝什么
What are you drinking?

468
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:48,640
咖啡
Coffee.

469
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:50,690
哪來的
Where'd you get it?

470
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:55,190
上周來的那些人
The people that came through last week.

471
00:51:56,860 --> 00:52:00,150
我不好意思說 我是拿什么交換來的 但是...
I'm a little embarrassed for what I traded to get it, but...

472
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:02,700
味道還不賴
it's not bad.

473
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:14,880
我能控制住賽斯
I had Seth under control.

474
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:18,460
我知道
Yeah, I know.

475
00:52:19,630 --> 00:52:22,630
我不想再聽到 你要把我調離巡邏隊的事了
And I don't wanna ever hear about you taking me off patrol again.

476
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:26,220
好
Okay.

477
00:52:34,060 --> 00:52:35,230
迪娜...
So, Dina.

478
00:52:37,940 --> 00:52:39,570
她是你的女朋友了
Is she your girlfriend now?

479
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:42,610
不 她...
No. No, she...

480
00:52:44,740 --> 00:52:47,660
那只是一個吻 沒什么意義
It was just one kiss. Didn't mean anything.

481
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:51,580
我不知道她為什么那么做
I don't know why she did that.

482
00:52:54,170 --> 00:52:55,170
但是...
But...

483
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,170
你確實喜歡她吧
you do like her?

484
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:04,630
我太蠢了
I'm so stupid.

485
00:53:08,470 --> 00:53:11,270
我不知道迪娜的心意 但是...
Look, I don't know what Dina's intentions are, but...

486
00:53:15,190 --> 00:53:16,810
她能擁有你是她的幸運
well, she'd be lucky to have you.

487
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:22,190
你真是個混蛋
You're such an asshole.

488
00:53:27,660 --> 00:53:28,990
你騙了我
You lied to me.

489
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:33,160
你眼睜睜地騙了我
You looked me in the eyes and you lied, 

490
00:53:33,290 --> 00:53:35,170
那時候也是這張臉
and it was the same face.

491
00:53:36,290 --> 00:53:38,460
這樣的表情
Same fucking look.

492
00:53:43,170 --> 00:53:44,930
但我早就知道了
But I think I knew already.

493
00:53:47,390 --> 00:53:49,220
我一直都知道
I knew this whole time.

494
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:57,730
所以我再給你最后一次機會
So, I'm gonna give you one last chance.

495
00:53:59,860 --> 00:54:02,070
告訴我火螢到底是怎么回事
Tell me what happened with the Fireflies.

496
00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:06,490
如果你再騙我 我們就別來往了
If you lie to me again, we're done.

497
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:18,000
真有其他免疫者嗎
Were there other immune people?

498
00:54:33,850 --> 00:54:35,270
我們真的遇到了掠奪者嗎
Were there Raiders?

499
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:46,530
他們能研制出解藥嗎
Could they have made a cure?

500
00:55:08,300 --> 00:55:09,340
你是不是...
Did you--

501
00:55:16,180 --> 00:55:17,480
包括瑪琳
And Marlene?

502
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:28,280
研制解藥...
Making a cure

503
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:32,410
會要了你的命
would've killed you.

504
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:37,580
我本來就該死 那是我的使命
Then, I was supposed to die. That was my purpose. 

505
00:55:37,700 --> 00:55:40,960
我的命本來很重要 但你剝奪了我的權利
My life would have fucking mattered! But you took that from me!

506
00:55:41,790 --> 00:55:43,460
你剝奪了所有人的機會
You took it from everyone.

507
00:55:45,590 --> 00:55:46,590
對
Yes.

508
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:51,180
我會付出代價的
And I'll pay the price

509
00:55:52,890 --> 00:55:55,060
因為你會背棄我
because you're gonna turn away from me.

510
00:56:00,020 --> 00:56:03,190
但如果讓我重來一遍...
But if somehow I had a second chance at that moment,

511
00:56:06,860 --> 00:56:08,570
我還是會那么做
I would do it all over again.

512
00:56:11,610 --> 00:56:13,490
因為你很自私
Because you're selfish.

513
00:56:14,910 --> 00:56:16,330
因為我愛你
Because I love you.

514
00:56:22,670 --> 00:56:23,750
以一種...
In a way you...

515
00:56:25,460 --> 00:56:27,170
你無法理解的方式愛你
you can't understand.

516
00:56:30,670 --> 00:56:32,010
也許你永遠理解不了
Maybe you never will.

517
00:56:35,510 --> 00:56:37,310
但如果將來有一天
But if that day should come,

518
00:56:39,970 --> 00:56:42,060
你有了自己的孩子...
if you should ever have one of your own,

519
00:56:48,690 --> 00:56:49,730
那么...
well, then...

520
00:56:53,950 --> 00:56:55,910
我希望你做得比我稍好一點
I hope you do a little better than me.

521
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:15,890
我覺得我沒辦法原諒你
I don't think I can forgive you for this.

522
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:27,230
但我愿意試試
But I would like to try.

523
00:58:05,690 --> 00:58:06,690
待續

524
00:58:06,690 --> 00:58:07,770
謝謝觀賞

525
00:59:27,060 --> 00:59:29,060
