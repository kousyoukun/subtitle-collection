1
00:00:03,291 --> 00:00:05,122
But the service isn't that fast.

2
00:00:06,494 --> 00:00:10,260
Believe me, you guys are gonna flip
over the sushi in this place.

3
00:00:10,432 --> 00:00:12,297
Hey, come in, everybody.

4
00:00:12,901 --> 00:00:15,927
Excuse me, wasn't this
a Japanese restaurant yesterday?

5
00:00:16,104 --> 00:00:19,631
Say, you got the sharp eye for detail,
don't you?

6
00:00:19,808 --> 00:00:20,934
So I've been told.

7
00:00:21,109 --> 00:00:25,273
My name is Panayoti Shakelaris,
but everybody call me Papa Jack.

8
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:27,775
- Why?
- Why?

9
00:00:30,118 --> 00:00:31,608
I don't know why.

10
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:33,382
Follow me, please.

11
00:00:33,555 --> 00:00:34,988
What an amusing anecdote.

12
00:00:35,156 --> 00:00:36,953
That's a nice table for you.

13
00:00:37,125 --> 00:00:38,956
Sit. Eat.

14
00:00:39,127 --> 00:00:41,789
Sing. Dance. Enjoy.

15
00:00:41,963 --> 00:00:44,295
You're gonna make us have fun,
aren't you?

16
00:00:44,466 --> 00:00:48,027
- Boy, neat menus.
- It's all Greek to me.

17
00:00:51,072 --> 00:00:54,098
- Is he dangerous?
- No, we'll be fine, thanks.

18
00:00:54,275 --> 00:00:57,676
Guys, wait.
I'll bring special treat for you.

19
00:00:58,013 --> 00:00:59,878
Excuse me.

20
00:01:03,551 --> 00:01:05,644
Did you put a piece of lettuce
in your pocket?

21
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:08,311
It's for Harvey. My new pet.

22
00:01:09,257 --> 00:01:12,920
Lettuce? Harvey? I get it.
Big, tough Bull's got little pet bunny.

23
00:01:13,361 --> 00:01:14,885
Actually, Harvey's a python.

24
00:01:16,097 --> 00:01:17,086
Oh.

25
00:01:17,265 --> 00:01:18,823
I feed him bunnies, though.

26
00:01:19,834 --> 00:01:22,029
- Could I watch sometime?
- Oh, fellas, please.

27
00:01:22,203 --> 00:01:25,536
Harry, you'd love to see a snake
eat a bunny as much as I would.

28
00:01:25,974 --> 00:01:30,343
- I hope that everybody's hungry.
- Oh, boy, my favorite. Fire.

29
00:01:30,512 --> 00:01:33,640
Hey, this must be the souvlaki.

30
00:01:33,815 --> 00:01:36,613
No, souvlaki doesn't throb.

31
00:01:36,785 --> 00:01:38,946
That's very interesting. What is it?

32
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,645
This is the brand-new specialty
of the house.

33
00:01:42,057 --> 00:01:44,719
Squid swimming in an olive oil base...

34
00:01:44,893 --> 00:01:47,623
...dripping with kasseri and feta cheese...

35
00:01:47,796 --> 00:01:50,822
...bubbling over noodles and pine nuts...

36
00:01:50,999 --> 00:01:54,662
...covered in a simmering
lemon garlic sauce.

37
00:01:55,637 --> 00:01:57,730
I'll take scrambled eggs.

38
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,832
Come on, everybody, eat up.

39
00:02:04,012 --> 00:02:08,642
Come on, guys. No reason not to try
something just because it's new, right?

40
00:02:09,751 --> 00:02:11,878
Oh, I can't believe what chickens
you guys are.

41
00:02:12,053 --> 00:02:15,989
Come on, food is not just something to eat,
it's something to celebrate.

42
00:02:17,325 --> 00:02:18,849
Have a ball.

43
00:02:26,835 --> 00:02:29,565
So, what's the verdict?

44
00:02:43,618 --> 00:02:45,643
Manslaughter.

45
00:03:28,563 --> 00:03:30,155
Tell me if this hurts.

46
00:03:30,331 --> 00:03:31,798
- Nope.
- This?

47
00:03:31,966 --> 00:03:33,058
Uh-uh.

48
00:03:33,234 --> 00:03:35,134
Oh, come on, that tickles.
Come on, come...

49
00:03:35,303 --> 00:03:37,237
Ow! Oh! Ooh, ha.

50
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:39,570
Hi, guys. Hi, how you doing?
Come on in.

51
00:03:39,741 --> 00:03:41,231
How is he?
- Oh, I'm fine.

52
00:03:41,409 --> 00:03:44,071
The man says I got a little pain
in my tummy, that's all.

53
00:03:44,245 --> 00:03:48,272
That's not what I said, judge. This doesn't
sound like simple indigestion to me.

54
00:03:48,449 --> 00:03:52,442
In my opinion,
you should see a doctor right away.

55
00:03:54,289 --> 00:03:57,349
- Well, you're a doctor, aren't you?
- Gynecologist.

56
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:02,320
You people are lucky
I happened to be eating in that place.

57
00:04:02,497 --> 00:04:05,466
I appreciate that,
but you're a little of out of your league.

58
00:04:05,633 --> 00:04:08,067
Let's just say
his league has a lower strike zone.

59
00:04:09,237 --> 00:04:11,865
I'm sorry, it was so easy.

60
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:15,100
- How often do you get these pains, judge?
- Oh, every now and then.

61
00:04:15,276 --> 00:04:16,504
Once a week? Once a day?

62
00:04:16,678 --> 00:04:18,737
Let him know
when they're five minutes apart.

63
00:04:18,913 --> 00:04:20,710
Dan.

64
00:04:20,882 --> 00:04:23,976
This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

65
00:04:24,152 --> 00:04:26,347
I'm afraid I can't do anything more,
Your Honor.

66
00:04:26,521 --> 00:04:28,716
You really should be seen by a specialist.

67
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:31,916
I mean, it's been years since l...

68
00:04:32,093 --> 00:04:34,323
Been with a man?

69
00:04:34,729 --> 00:04:36,993
It is easy.

70
00:04:37,932 --> 00:04:41,629
If I were you, judge, I'd get myself
down to a hospital for some tests.

71
00:04:41,803 --> 00:04:44,670
No time, doc.
I got places to go, people to convict.

72
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:47,273
I think you're making a big mistake.

73
00:04:47,442 --> 00:04:50,878
But, then, I just did this for free.

74
00:04:51,813 --> 00:04:52,905
Are you crazy?

75
00:04:53,081 --> 00:04:54,708
You vomited, doubled-up in pain...

76
00:04:54,882 --> 00:04:57,510
...a doctor tells you go to the hospital,
you do nothing.

77
00:04:57,685 --> 00:04:59,516
Believe it or not.

78
00:04:59,687 --> 00:05:02,656
- Harry, listen...
- Come on, give me credit for some sense.

79
00:05:02,824 --> 00:05:04,485
I don't have to go to the hospital.

80
00:05:04,659 --> 00:05:07,253
What a bunch of gloomy gusses.

81
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:11,221
Hey, nice shoes, Selma.

82
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:15,936
Thanks. They're orthopedic.

83
00:05:16,104 --> 00:05:18,334
Let's go back to work, huh, guys?

84
00:05:18,506 --> 00:05:20,235
Your Honor...

85
00:05:20,575 --> 00:05:22,600
...if anything should happen to you...

86
00:05:23,244 --> 00:05:28,204
- I'll see you get my parking space.
- Oh, great, thank you. Take care, sir.

87
00:05:28,816 --> 00:05:31,944
The truth.
When's the last time you saw a doctor?

88
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:33,585
Thirty, 40 seconds ago.

89
00:05:33,755 --> 00:05:36,155
- Before that?
- Third grade.

90
00:05:36,324 --> 00:05:37,916
I almost lost part of my ear.

91
00:05:38,092 --> 00:05:41,027
Showing off in school.
Got my head stuck in the heating duct.

92
00:05:41,195 --> 00:05:43,288
- Harry...
- Should've taken off the vent.

93
00:05:43,464 --> 00:05:46,024
- Now, Harry, just listen to me.
- I just read a book...

94
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:50,034
...by a guy who cured a serious illness
with laughter. It was terrific.

95
00:05:50,204 --> 00:05:52,536
He just watched
old comedy movies, cartoons...

96
00:05:52,707 --> 00:05:54,766
...anything that would make him laugh.

97
00:05:54,942 --> 00:05:58,469
You know what they say,
"Laughter is the best medicine."

98
00:05:59,714 --> 00:06:02,376
- See? I feel better already.
- Great.

99
00:06:03,718 --> 00:06:06,312
You don't wanna listen
to common sense.

100
00:06:06,821 --> 00:06:09,153
I'll be right there, I just...

101
00:06:09,457 --> 00:06:11,891
I gotta powder my nose.

102
00:06:21,536 --> 00:06:24,164
You okay, Your Honor?
Heard you had a little problem.

103
00:06:24,339 --> 00:06:27,797
- Never felt better, big guy.
- Well, good, good.

104
00:06:27,975 --> 00:06:29,272
Hey, Mac?

105
00:06:29,444 --> 00:06:32,845
- Wanna know what I've been thinking?
- Well, now you know I do, sir.

106
00:06:33,014 --> 00:06:35,812
I read that the Detroit Lions
have a new stadium.

107
00:06:35,983 --> 00:06:37,348
They got a dome, Mac.

108
00:06:37,685 --> 00:06:40,677
Isn't that a breath of fresh air, sir.

109
00:06:40,855 --> 00:06:44,052
Anyway, now you could have the Lions
hosting the Chicago Bears.

110
00:06:44,225 --> 00:06:46,693
Then, the Detroit baseball team
could be playing.

111
00:06:46,861 --> 00:06:48,920
And then you know who's all playing
at once?

112
00:06:49,097 --> 00:06:53,227
- Lions and Tigers and Bears.
- Oh, my.

113
00:06:54,936 --> 00:06:56,335
Great stuff, huh, Mac?

114
00:06:56,504 --> 00:07:00,497
Yeah, you just keep setting them up,
and I'll keep bringing them home, sir.

115
00:07:03,144 --> 00:07:05,738
You're hurting.
Why don't you recess for the evening?

116
00:07:05,913 --> 00:07:09,610
I saw a doctor. He said I have a little
problem with my tummy. That's all.

117
00:07:10,017 --> 00:07:13,384
Your Honor, my cousin had a little problem
with his tummy for six years.

118
00:07:13,554 --> 00:07:17,490
They finally operated, found the problem.
He's been the picture of health ever since.

119
00:07:17,658 --> 00:07:20,183
See? You're not alone.
It happens to a lot of people.

120
00:07:20,528 --> 00:07:24,988
Not really. They found out my cousin
had been carrying his unborn twin brother.

121
00:07:26,501 --> 00:07:28,332
- That's disgusting.
- It wasn't very big.

122
00:07:28,503 --> 00:07:30,368
- Stop.
- There was no reason to name him.

123
00:07:30,538 --> 00:07:33,507
All right, move along, people, huh?

124
00:07:34,108 --> 00:07:37,407
- What is that stench?
- That's our first case, Your Honor.

125
00:07:37,845 --> 00:07:42,009
Edward Antoine and Philip Falcone.

126
00:07:45,753 --> 00:07:47,015
What's the problem?

127
00:07:47,188 --> 00:07:50,282
Well, I just got fed up with the noise,
Your Honor, that's all.

128
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:52,050
Every week, for six years...

129
00:07:52,226 --> 00:07:54,786
...this bozo comes by
with his lousy sanitation truck...

130
00:07:54,962 --> 00:07:56,259
...at 5:00 in the morning.

131
00:07:56,431 --> 00:07:58,729
You get a jump on the morning rush.

132
00:07:59,066 --> 00:08:02,001
Your Honor, they're charging each other
with aggravated assault.

133
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:06,504
Your Honor, if I may,
it seems that the story unfolds as follows:

134
00:08:06,674 --> 00:08:09,165
- Pace, woman, pace.
- Apparently, Mr. Antoine got up...

135
00:08:09,343 --> 00:08:12,642
...went outside and demanded an apology.
- He threw a dead cat at me.

136
00:08:12,814 --> 00:08:14,782
I didn't know what was in that shoebox.

137
00:08:14,949 --> 00:08:17,941
At which point, Mr. Antoine
took Mr. Falcone's patio furniture...

138
00:08:18,119 --> 00:08:20,849
...put it in his crusher,
and turned it into linguine.

139
00:08:21,022 --> 00:08:22,080
Mr. Antoine jumped him.

140
00:08:22,256 --> 00:08:25,316
When police arrived, they had been
rolling in swill for 10 minutes.

141
00:08:25,493 --> 00:08:29,759
They've been in the holding cell
since 7:00 this morning, fermenting.

142
00:08:29,931 --> 00:08:33,458
Your Honor, I've been picking filth and scum
out of my clothes all day long.

143
00:08:33,634 --> 00:08:35,795
Rancid dog food, used dental floss...

144
00:08:36,137 --> 00:08:40,096
...and this is what olive loaf turns into
after a couple weeks.

145
00:08:40,274 --> 00:08:45,041
Yeah, the lavender fuzz
kind of gives it away.

146
00:08:47,248 --> 00:08:49,273
Whoops.

147
00:08:53,921 --> 00:08:55,388
Found it.

148
00:08:55,556 --> 00:08:56,921
Harry, what is it?

149
00:08:57,091 --> 00:08:58,388
A pencil. Ever seen one?

150
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:00,117
You are sick, see a doctor.

151
00:09:00,294 --> 00:09:02,125
Leave me alone, Miss Young.

152
00:09:02,296 --> 00:09:04,787
See? See? We can all get upset, huh?

153
00:09:04,966 --> 00:09:07,730
But while you're sitting up there,
all nice and comfy...

154
00:09:07,902 --> 00:09:12,339
...there's guys like me down in the trenches
who are shoveling your sludge all day.

155
00:09:12,507 --> 00:09:15,442
- Perhaps you could speed up...
- And then you got guys like him...

156
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:19,808
...always putting you down,
ripping my guts out, bit by bit.

157
00:09:20,214 --> 00:09:22,045
For 15 years, they've been at it.

158
00:09:22,216 --> 00:09:24,980
Just slowly twisting that knife
in my belly.

159
00:09:25,152 --> 00:09:27,177
- Mr. Falcone...
- You got any idea how that must feel?

160
00:09:29,123 --> 00:09:31,455
Exactly.

161
00:09:31,993 --> 00:09:33,392
Harry.

162
00:09:35,897 --> 00:09:38,991
<i>Dr. Seidelman,
line one, please. Dr. Seidelman.</i>

163
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:59,584
<i>Just so you know,
The Rifleman goes on in 25 minutes.</i>

164
00:09:59,954 --> 00:10:02,286
Yeah, keep me posted on that, huh?

165
00:10:02,456 --> 00:10:06,950
Sure. I always keep my roommates informed
of their potential entertainment selections.

166
00:10:07,128 --> 00:10:08,755
- Listen, mister...
- I'm Kenny.

167
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:10,898
You just go ahead,
watch whatever you want.

168
00:10:11,065 --> 00:10:12,589
Okay.

169
00:10:13,935 --> 00:10:16,165
I love these beds.

170
00:10:16,337 --> 00:10:18,601
They go up and down, you know?

171
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:22,173
I love the sheets too.
We get them fresh every morning.

172
00:10:22,343 --> 00:10:25,608
And I love the doctors and nurses
who keep stopping by to say hello.

173
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:27,077
And the smell of antiseptic.

174
00:10:28,516 --> 00:10:31,815
And the food.
Tomorrow we get muffins and juice at 6:00.

175
00:10:35,122 --> 00:10:37,420
I love the walls.

176
00:10:42,863 --> 00:10:45,730
You all have to be patient.
I'm really doing everything I can.

177
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,595
- That's all you can tell us?
- Listen.

178
00:10:47,768 --> 00:10:51,727
All we know that we know is he has all
the classic symptoms of duodenal distress.

179
00:10:51,906 --> 00:10:55,205
- Duodenal distress?
- Possible ulcer.

180
00:10:55,376 --> 00:10:57,071
Thank you.

181
00:10:57,244 --> 00:10:59,974
The problem is
he refuses to submit to any tests.

182
00:11:00,147 --> 00:11:01,171
That's unbelievable.

183
00:11:01,349 --> 00:11:03,749
The ER specialist recommends
an immediate endoscopy.

184
00:11:03,918 --> 00:11:05,613
- Now that's...
- The oral insertion...

185
00:11:05,786 --> 00:11:09,222
...of a miniature probe
to detect specific intestinal...

186
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:11,654
I'm sorry, you were saying?

187
00:11:12,793 --> 00:11:18,288
The oral insertion of a miniature probe
to detect specific intestinal...

188
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,428
...things.

189
00:11:22,169 --> 00:11:24,535
- How old are you?
- Thirty-one.

190
00:11:24,705 --> 00:11:26,866
I've got underwear older than that.

191
00:11:30,678 --> 00:11:32,543
Oh, there'll be no smoking in this wing.

192
00:11:32,713 --> 00:11:35,307
- Oh, I'll be in the lounge.
- No smoking in the lounge.

193
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:39,811
I'll be out front sitting in the street.

194
00:11:44,258 --> 00:11:46,920
You're the third person in that bed
in two days.

195
00:11:49,897 --> 00:11:50,921
What happened?

196
00:11:51,332 --> 00:11:54,233
The angel of death took them all.

197
00:11:55,636 --> 00:11:58,833
Here's to you
making it through the night.

198
00:12:01,909 --> 00:12:03,103
- Hi.
- Oh, hi, guys.

199
00:12:03,277 --> 00:12:05,245
- Hey, Harry.
- How you feeling?

200
00:12:05,413 --> 00:12:06,846
Are you kidding? Never better.

201
00:12:07,014 --> 00:12:09,448
Then what was all that
screaming about, Harry?

202
00:12:09,617 --> 00:12:12,211
- Take a nap, Kenny.
- Sure.

203
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:15,589
Judge Stone, you must have
the tests I've indicated.

204
00:12:15,756 --> 00:12:17,348
No sale, doc.

205
00:12:17,725 --> 00:12:19,590
Let me handle this.

206
00:12:20,528 --> 00:12:22,155
Handle what?

207
00:12:23,264 --> 00:12:25,732
When I was a child,
my mother told me this story...

208
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,993
...and I'd like to pass it on to you.

209
00:12:28,169 --> 00:12:30,399
It seems there was this...

210
00:12:31,906 --> 00:12:33,203
...elf.

211
00:12:33,374 --> 00:12:36,502
And he had to go the hospital
because he had pains in his stomach...

212
00:12:36,677 --> 00:12:41,478
...and he refused
to take the tests, and, uh...

213
00:12:41,649 --> 00:12:42,673
...he died.

214
00:12:43,984 --> 00:12:46,179
That stinks.

215
00:12:47,588 --> 00:12:50,557
Why didn't anybody stop me?
Couldn't you see I was over my head?

216
00:12:50,725 --> 00:12:55,424
Harry, for heaven's sakes, do what
this guy wants, and take the tests.

217
00:12:55,596 --> 00:12:57,223
Can't do it. Didn't study.

218
00:13:01,969 --> 00:13:03,937
That's very funny.

219
00:13:04,105 --> 00:13:06,005
- Didn't study.
- Hello, Mr. Beilin.

220
00:13:06,173 --> 00:13:08,198
Hello, hello, doctor. How are you?

221
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:12,436
- And how are we feeling this evening?
- Oh, I'm in agony, doctor.

222
00:13:12,613 --> 00:13:16,071
- Oh?
- I think I'm having a stroke.

223
00:13:16,617 --> 00:13:19,882
Gosh, I'm sorry to hear that.
You want some juice?

224
00:13:20,254 --> 00:13:21,778
Well, if you think it would help.

225
00:13:22,857 --> 00:13:24,825
I'm sure it will.

226
00:13:25,059 --> 00:13:27,619
How about cran-apple, if you have any.

227
00:13:28,629 --> 00:13:30,654
Uh, what's with him?

228
00:13:30,831 --> 00:13:31,889
Munchausen syndrome.

229
00:13:32,066 --> 00:13:35,502
It's essentially a psychosomatic condition.
The patient wanders...

230
00:13:35,669 --> 00:13:39,230
...from hospital to hospital, claiming
to suffer from a variety of illnesses.

231
00:13:39,406 --> 00:13:42,466
In reality, it's merely a ploy for attention
by lonely people.

232
00:13:42,643 --> 00:13:45,407
I've read studies that indicate
several of these patients...

233
00:13:45,579 --> 00:13:48,844
...are quite intelligent,
despite their superficial histrionics.

234
00:13:49,016 --> 00:13:55,114
Their subconscious motivations stem from
a lack of stable interpersonal relationships.

235
00:13:56,991 --> 00:13:59,824
You're all like this, aren't you?

236
00:14:00,828 --> 00:14:05,162
Oh, hey, kid, would you get me some
of that juice out there? Thanks, babe. Hey.

237
00:14:05,733 --> 00:14:07,428
Hey, gang.

238
00:14:08,803 --> 00:14:10,293
How are you feeling, sir?

239
00:14:10,471 --> 00:14:14,066
Well, despite what everyone seems
to believe, I am feeling great.

240
00:14:14,241 --> 00:14:17,540
Terrific. Hey, look what I got
in the gift shop.

241
00:14:17,711 --> 00:14:18,871
Hey, nice watch.

242
00:14:19,046 --> 00:14:21,537
Dan, you really shouldn't have.

243
00:14:21,715 --> 00:14:24,183
Why the hell not?
I've always wanted one.

244
00:14:25,486 --> 00:14:26,976
Got you some Chiclets.

245
00:14:29,023 --> 00:14:31,548
So you going under the knife
or what?

246
00:14:31,725 --> 00:14:33,488
As a matter of fact, I'm going home.

247
00:14:33,661 --> 00:14:35,754
Okay, everybody out.

248
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:40,594
- I would like a minute alone with him.
- You're gonna get it now, Harry.

249
00:14:40,768 --> 00:14:45,865
Oh, hey, guys. Come on, I found out
where the nurses change.

250
00:14:49,109 --> 00:14:51,009
So? What do you wanna talk about?

251
00:14:51,512 --> 00:14:53,912
How about nuclear arms reduction?

252
00:14:54,081 --> 00:14:55,139
Sir, please.

253
00:14:55,316 --> 00:14:57,181
Oh, gotcha, it's too heavy.

254
00:14:57,351 --> 00:14:59,819
How about the year
those Cubbies had, huh?

255
00:15:00,321 --> 00:15:02,312
- Excuse us, won't you?
- Sure.

256
00:15:02,489 --> 00:15:04,923
- Bye, Harry.
- Bye, Kenny.

257
00:15:06,327 --> 00:15:08,488
Well, you got a great bedside manner.

258
00:15:08,662 --> 00:15:10,687
And you got a big space
between your ears.

259
00:15:10,865 --> 00:15:12,025
Billie, I'm fine.

260
00:15:12,199 --> 00:15:14,633
That's why they brought you here
in an ambulance.

261
00:15:14,802 --> 00:15:17,100
Well, it was fun.
They let Bull work the siren.

262
00:15:17,271 --> 00:15:20,604
- Come on, Harry.
- Billie, I appreciate your concern.

263
00:15:20,774 --> 00:15:24,335
Really, I do. But trust me, I'm fine.

264
00:15:27,181 --> 00:15:29,274
- Really.
- Get back in that bed.

265
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:30,781
No.

266
00:15:33,787 --> 00:15:36,085
Now, normally I would
consider this fun, but...

267
00:15:36,257 --> 00:15:39,556
- Harry. You are sick. Just say it.
- Okay, I'm sick.

268
00:15:39,727 --> 00:15:41,217
- Then you'll take the tests?
- No.

269
00:15:41,395 --> 00:15:42,760
What is it? Are you scared?

270
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:45,694
- I'm scared? Come on, don't be silly.
- You are, aren't you?

271
00:15:45,866 --> 00:15:49,063
That is ridiculous. Why in the world
would you say I'm scared?

272
00:15:49,236 --> 00:15:50,863
Harry?

273
00:15:53,674 --> 00:15:55,437
It's getting stuffy in here.

274
00:15:55,609 --> 00:15:57,668
Then stop breathing.

275
00:15:58,045 --> 00:15:59,774
I'll try that.

276
00:16:01,415 --> 00:16:06,443
Okay. Okay, maybe I am a little scared.

277
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:09,214
Well, it's nothing to be ashamed of.

278
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:11,358
Everybody's scared
when they come in here.

279
00:16:11,525 --> 00:16:13,254
I know my father was.

280
00:16:13,427 --> 00:16:15,952
They had him come in
for some of these same tests.

281
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:17,597
He never came out.

282
00:16:19,566 --> 00:16:20,590
- But...
- But what?

283
00:16:20,768 --> 00:16:24,829
It's one of those things, could've happen to
anybody? Doesn't mean it's gonna happen?

284
00:16:25,005 --> 00:16:26,905
I'm sorry, Harry.

285
00:16:27,574 --> 00:16:28,768
But you are a judge.

286
00:16:28,943 --> 00:16:32,003
You deal with other people's problems
every day.

287
00:16:32,346 --> 00:16:35,338
Now, can't you find it in yourself
to deal with your own?

288
00:16:35,516 --> 00:16:37,848
Well, intellectually,
that makes a lot of sense.

289
00:16:38,018 --> 00:16:41,351
But emotionally, I can't handle it.

290
00:16:42,623 --> 00:16:44,147
Take off your pants.

291
00:16:44,325 --> 00:16:46,088
What'd she say?

292
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,084
- I'm getting out.
- No, you're not.

293
00:16:48,262 --> 00:16:50,526
- Billie, let go of me.
- I think I can take you.

294
00:16:50,698 --> 00:16:53,064
- Don't make me hurt you.
- You got no meat on you.

295
00:16:53,233 --> 00:16:54,598
You're a woman, be serious.

296
00:16:54,768 --> 00:16:59,034
- Get back in that bed.
- Okay, I warned you.

297
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:05,671
All right, you stringy little magistrate.

298
00:17:05,846 --> 00:17:09,213
Now listen, you're hurting your friends
as well as yourself.

299
00:17:09,383 --> 00:17:11,214
- You know, I let you win.
- Just quiet.

300
00:17:12,286 --> 00:17:14,379
I'm not finished.

301
00:17:14,788 --> 00:17:17,052
You mean a lot to us, Harry.

302
00:17:17,224 --> 00:17:19,021
We all care about you.

303
00:17:21,128 --> 00:17:23,255
You mean a lot to me.

304
00:17:23,864 --> 00:17:25,058
I care.

305
00:17:26,633 --> 00:17:30,831
- I want a rematch when I'm healthy.
- Damn, don't you understand?

306
00:17:31,271 --> 00:17:34,035
I don't want you out of my life yet.

307
00:17:35,042 --> 00:17:36,634
You just got here.

308
00:17:38,312 --> 00:17:40,041
Billie.

309
00:17:40,881 --> 00:17:43,475
What you seem to be saying is...

310
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:47,177
She wants to jump your bones, Harry.

311
00:17:55,696 --> 00:17:59,132
My God, I called that one, didn't I?

312
00:18:00,234 --> 00:18:02,725
Harry, I was...
Let me get that curtain for you.

313
00:18:02,903 --> 00:18:04,268
We were just talking.

314
00:18:04,438 --> 00:18:08,340
- I don't care what you have going on in...
I've decided.

315
00:18:09,676 --> 00:18:11,268
I'm gonna have those tests.

316
00:18:11,445 --> 00:18:14,141
That's great news. I'll tell Bull.
He's down at pediatrics.

317
00:18:14,314 --> 00:18:17,112
The kids are riding him.

318
00:18:18,685 --> 00:18:21,313
You are gonna have the tests?

319
00:18:21,522 --> 00:18:22,921
Well, I suppose I should, huh?

320
00:18:23,957 --> 00:18:28,121
I mean, don't you wanna find out
how things turn out?

321
00:18:29,296 --> 00:18:30,593
Yeah, I do.

322
00:18:30,764 --> 00:18:32,288
Ditto.

323
00:18:32,533 --> 00:18:34,797
The walls have ears.

324
00:18:35,102 --> 00:18:37,832
I love the walls.

325
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:55,882
- Mr. Beilin.
- Hello. Hello, doctor.

326
00:18:56,623 --> 00:18:59,751
- You're fit as a fiddle.
- Oh, no. Oh, no, no, no.

327
00:18:59,927 --> 00:19:03,124
Sir, we have run every test on you.
There's nothing wrong.

328
00:19:03,297 --> 00:19:04,491
I'm having a stroke.

329
00:19:05,399 --> 00:19:06,661
No, you're not, Mr. Beilin.

330
00:19:06,834 --> 00:19:11,362
Now, look, why don't you just get dressed,
pack up your things and go on home, okay?

331
00:19:15,442 --> 00:19:16,704
So, doc?
- Mm-hm.

332
00:19:16,877 --> 00:19:19,311
- What's the good word?
- Surgery.

333
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,510
That was a rhetorical question.

334
00:19:22,683 --> 00:19:24,548
- Well, minor surgery.
- Yeah?

335
00:19:24,718 --> 00:19:26,447
Yeah, we found something
on the x-ray.

336
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:28,144
The sooner we pull it,
the better.

337
00:19:29,089 --> 00:19:31,956
- Pull what out?
- There it is, right there.

338
00:19:32,126 --> 00:19:34,060
- Tumor?
- Ulcer?

339
00:19:34,228 --> 00:19:35,695
- Whistle?
- We have a winner.

340
00:19:35,863 --> 00:19:37,694
- It's a whistle?
- Mm-hm.

341
00:19:37,865 --> 00:19:41,995
That's where it is.
I must've swallowed it.

342
00:19:42,402 --> 00:19:44,029
That would be my guess, yes.

343
00:19:44,638 --> 00:19:45,662
You know Zippy Bits?

344
00:19:45,839 --> 00:19:49,468
That breakfast cereal that promises
a free circus whistle in each box?

345
00:19:49,643 --> 00:19:52,612
Well, I bought a box, polished off
the whole thing. No whistle.

346
00:19:52,779 --> 00:19:57,182
I even called them. They said
there was a whistle in every box.

347
00:19:57,684 --> 00:20:00,312
- Guess they were right.
- You mean...

348
00:20:00,487 --> 00:20:05,220
You mean, he's been carrying a piece
of plastic in his stomach all these years?

349
00:20:05,392 --> 00:20:07,519
No, about three weeks.

350
00:20:08,795 --> 00:20:11,525
- What?
- Silly me, huh?

351
00:20:11,698 --> 00:20:13,893
- Ow.
- A whistle?

352
00:20:14,301 --> 00:20:17,668
I poured my guts out to you
over a whistle?

353
00:20:17,838 --> 00:20:20,136
Come on, you're supposed to like me.

354
00:20:20,307 --> 00:20:22,241
Come on, judge.
We'll get your whistle.

355
00:20:22,409 --> 00:20:24,309
Everyone's gonna
have to leave the room.

356
00:20:24,478 --> 00:20:26,969
Zippy Bits, huh?

357
00:20:29,049 --> 00:20:31,813
I opened myself up to him.

358
00:20:32,052 --> 00:20:33,576
Over Zippy Bits.

359
00:20:33,754 --> 00:20:38,851
I did it once for a piece of chocolate
and a pair of nylons.

360
00:20:42,963 --> 00:20:44,692
Get Operating Room 3 ready, okay?

361
00:20:44,865 --> 00:20:47,663
- Right. Hi.
- Hi.

362
00:20:47,834 --> 00:20:50,428
I got a day off tomorrow.

363
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:53,005
I got a new watch.

364
00:20:54,641 --> 00:20:56,438
See you, Harry.
- Good luck, sir.

365
00:20:56,610 --> 00:20:59,670
Thanks. See you, Selma.

366
00:21:03,984 --> 00:21:05,246
Billie.

367
00:21:08,522 --> 00:21:10,285
I want you to know...

368
00:21:11,592 --> 00:21:13,924
...I lied to you about
how I felt, Harry Stone.

369
00:21:14,795 --> 00:21:17,286
I just did it to get you
to take those tests.

370
00:21:18,498 --> 00:21:21,023
- I understand.
- You do?

371
00:21:21,201 --> 00:21:23,567
Probably would've done
the same for you.

372
00:21:23,737 --> 00:21:26,069
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

373
00:21:26,974 --> 00:21:32,002
So, what you're saying is you really don't
care all that much about me either, right?

374
00:21:32,179 --> 00:21:36,275
- I didn't say that. I care a lot about you.
- You do?

375
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:39,146
I care a lot about people in general.

376
00:21:39,319 --> 00:21:42,379
I mean, isn't that what this
is all about, Billie? Caring?

377
00:21:45,058 --> 00:21:46,582
Go on.

378
00:21:50,998 --> 00:21:53,865
- Did you hear something?
- No.

379
00:21:54,768 --> 00:21:56,736
Now, the way I see it...

380
00:22:00,107 --> 00:22:02,200
- Hi, Selma.
- Oh, how's Harry?

381
00:22:02,376 --> 00:22:05,106
Oh, he came through with flying colors.

382
00:22:05,279 --> 00:22:07,008
He'll be up and around in a few days.

383
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:08,238
Great.
- Yeah.

384
00:22:08,415 --> 00:22:14,945
I'm going down and have a cigarette.
I must be a carton behind by now.

385
00:22:15,756 --> 00:22:17,246
Mac?

386
00:22:18,759 --> 00:22:19,783
Kenny?

387
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:22,019
I have the most wonderful news.

388
00:22:22,195 --> 00:22:23,662
Yeah?

389
00:22:24,798 --> 00:22:26,527
Well...

390
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:29,498
- Broken arms.
- Ohh.

391
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:33,538
- Congratulations.
- I've got internal things too.

392
00:22:33,707 --> 00:22:35,572
Yeah?

393
00:22:36,977 --> 00:22:43,712
"Bruised kidney, two cracked ribs..."
Fractured tibia? Hey, you hit the jackpot.

394
00:22:44,951 --> 00:22:47,385
I don't know why
I never thought of it before.

395
00:22:48,755 --> 00:22:50,086
Thought of what?

396
00:22:51,958 --> 00:22:54,449
Is this Judge Stone's room?

397
00:22:54,628 --> 00:22:57,688
Yeah, but he's gone.

398
00:22:58,498 --> 00:22:59,897
When?

399
00:23:00,067 --> 00:23:02,900
Oh, about two hours ago.
