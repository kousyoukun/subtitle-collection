1
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:04,882
<i>You must have been a beautiful baby</i>

2
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:08,051
<i>You must have been a beautiful...</i>

3
00:00:10,532 --> 00:00:12,557
<i>Fowl</i>

4
00:00:13,935 --> 00:00:15,903
Where'd you come from?

5
00:00:18,707 --> 00:00:21,005
You got any plans for Thanksgiving?

6
00:00:21,176 --> 00:00:23,736
Yeah. He's coming
to my house for dinner.

7
00:00:23,912 --> 00:00:24,936
Hey, Mac.

8
00:00:25,113 --> 00:00:27,513
You don't mind me parking
my bird here, do you, sir?

9
00:00:27,682 --> 00:00:29,047
It's only temporary.

10
00:00:29,217 --> 00:00:32,550
I'm hauling him upstate
to my family's house tomorrow.

11
00:00:32,721 --> 00:00:35,588
I take it Mr. Gobbler is less a pet
than he is...

12
00:00:35,757 --> 00:00:38,419
Entree. Yes, sir.

13
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,484
It's sort of a holiday tradition.

14
00:00:40,662 --> 00:00:43,859
We get a live one,
fatten him, axe him and eat him.

15
00:00:44,032 --> 00:00:45,465
Sounds festive.

16
00:00:45,633 --> 00:00:47,931
What do you guys do for Christmas?

17
00:00:48,103 --> 00:00:50,594
You don't wanna know, sir.

18
00:00:52,941 --> 00:00:55,034
Shut up, turkey.

19
00:00:57,579 --> 00:01:00,810
So, uh, I mean, I got immunity, right?

20
00:01:01,516 --> 00:01:04,451
- Against many things, I'm sure.
- Ha-ha-ha.

21
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:06,644
I mean, if I testify.

22
00:01:06,821 --> 00:01:09,051
Yes, Miss Korchak.

23
00:01:09,224 --> 00:01:11,624
Well, how do I look?

24
00:01:11,793 --> 00:01:13,727
It isn't too much powder, is it?

25
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:16,726
Not if you're skiing.

26
00:01:20,101 --> 00:01:21,864
All rise.

27
00:01:22,537 --> 00:01:25,233
Manhattan Criminal Court Part 2
is now in session...

28
00:01:25,407 --> 00:01:27,568
...the Honorable Harold T. Stone
presiding.

29
00:01:29,878 --> 00:01:32,278
- Good evening, ladies.
- Hi.

30
00:01:32,747 --> 00:01:33,771
Let me guess, uh...

31
00:01:33,948 --> 00:01:36,416
...sorority prom
had a few too many daiquiris...

32
00:01:36,584 --> 00:01:40,111
...got a little giddy,
raised a little heck, right?

33
00:01:40,288 --> 00:01:42,483
They're hookers, sir.

34
00:01:43,058 --> 00:01:46,084
- Wasn't even in the ballpark, was I?
- Uh-huh.

35
00:01:46,261 --> 00:01:47,421
You may be seated.

36
00:01:49,164 --> 00:01:50,324
What's the story?

37
00:01:50,498 --> 00:01:53,126
Cops busted a house over on 72nd.

38
00:01:53,301 --> 00:01:56,532
Yes, Your Honor,
on a tip from Miss Angela Korchak...

39
00:01:56,704 --> 00:01:58,331
...a disgruntled former employee...

40
00:01:58,506 --> 00:02:02,670
...an undercover officer was sent to the
address in question, partied heartily...

41
00:02:02,844 --> 00:02:05,608
...subsequently determined it
to be a house of prostitution.

42
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:08,977
In support of which charge,
I submit confiscated financial records...

43
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:13,917
...an appointment book,
and this swatch of red velvet wallpaper.

44
00:02:14,522 --> 00:02:17,389
I had a tuxedo like this once.

45
00:02:18,226 --> 00:02:19,989
Your Honor, I move for postponement...

46
00:02:20,161 --> 00:02:22,721
...pending the location
of the owner of the building.

47
00:02:22,897 --> 00:02:27,197
Yes, a warrant has been issued for the
madam of the house, a Miss Irene Danbury.

48
00:02:27,368 --> 00:02:28,528
Hey, I know her.

49
00:02:30,171 --> 00:02:32,366
Well, I mean,
she's sort of famous, isn't she?

50
00:02:32,874 --> 00:02:34,603
<i>I saw her on Merv.</i>

51
00:02:34,776 --> 00:02:40,009
Yeah. I think it was his salute
to mattresses.

52
00:02:40,682 --> 00:02:43,617
I read an article about her
in one of those financial magazines.

53
00:02:43,785 --> 00:02:45,753
The Mogul Madam,
I believe they called her.

54
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,481
Well, Miss Danbury is famous for being
a respected member of the community...

55
00:02:49,657 --> 00:02:51,682
...and a generous patron of the arts.

56
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:52,986
Yes, the Arts.

57
00:02:53,161 --> 00:02:55,561
- The Bobs, the Teds, the...
Yeah.

58
00:02:56,297 --> 00:02:59,494
Regardless, we're just spinning our wheels
till Miss Danbury arrives.

59
00:02:59,667 --> 00:03:03,967
So let's put the ladies on the back burner,
Selma, and we'll move along.

60
00:03:04,139 --> 00:03:05,470
Next case.

61
00:03:05,907 --> 00:03:08,603
- Come on, girls, let's hustle.
- Ha-ha.

62
00:03:08,776 --> 00:03:11,404
If you think you're up to it. Ha-ha-ha.

63
00:03:11,579 --> 00:03:15,242
Honey, I was up to it and went beyond it.

64
00:03:15,583 --> 00:03:17,050
What's beyond it?

65
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:22,513
Rest, honey.
Decades and decades of rest.

66
00:04:04,465 --> 00:04:06,956
Hey, turkey.

67
00:04:08,269 --> 00:04:10,134
Turkey.

68
00:04:10,872 --> 00:04:12,863
Want a CornNut?

69
00:04:13,508 --> 00:04:16,671
CornNut. Num-num.

70
00:04:19,981 --> 00:04:23,382
Mmm. Nacho cheese.

71
00:04:24,052 --> 00:04:26,350
Hey, you better be careful with him.

72
00:04:26,754 --> 00:04:31,817
- You don't mind me feeding him, do you?
- Oh, no. Please do.

73
00:04:31,993 --> 00:04:33,824
What's his name?

74
00:04:33,995 --> 00:04:36,429
- I don't know.
- He's gotta have a name.

75
00:04:36,598 --> 00:04:40,295
Oh? Well, how about, uh...

76
00:04:40,768 --> 00:04:42,497
Protein.

77
00:04:44,205 --> 00:04:46,969
Protein? That's a funny name for a pet.

78
00:04:53,481 --> 00:04:54,812
You're not gonna kill him?

79
00:04:55,717 --> 00:04:59,050
No, it's my sister's turn.

80
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:04,788
Come on, Bull, judge wants to start up.

81
00:05:05,727 --> 00:05:07,592
Know what he's gonna do
with that turkey?

82
00:05:07,762 --> 00:05:12,062
Hey, as long
as they're consenting adults.

83
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:20,164
Hi, judge.

84
00:05:20,341 --> 00:05:22,366
Anything disgusting
and newsworthy tonight?

85
00:05:24,812 --> 00:05:26,575
Go away, Craven, I hate you...

86
00:05:26,748 --> 00:05:28,613
...you're scum.

87
00:05:30,184 --> 00:05:33,642
Did you know it's been three weeks
since somebody's been thrown off a roof?

88
00:05:33,821 --> 00:05:35,686
What's happening to this city?

89
00:05:35,857 --> 00:05:37,688
- Bull alert.
- Huh?

90
00:05:39,861 --> 00:05:40,885
Uh... Ahem.

91
00:05:41,062 --> 00:05:44,498
Look, you see, I really have to go,
because my car is double-parked...

92
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:47,157
...in a handicap zone.

93
00:05:47,335 --> 00:05:50,668
I could arrange it
so you could park there legally.

94
00:05:59,447 --> 00:06:00,675
Thank you, gentlemen.

95
00:06:00,848 --> 00:06:02,611
You've both been very kind.

96
00:06:02,784 --> 00:06:04,217
It was my pleasure.

97
00:06:04,385 --> 00:06:07,149
I wish everyone was as easy.

98
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:10,981
Carlene, sit up straight.

99
00:06:11,159 --> 00:06:13,525
Tracy, get rid of the gum, please.

100
00:06:13,928 --> 00:06:15,418
Thank you.

101
00:06:17,198 --> 00:06:18,790
<i>Thanks.</i>

102
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:20,961
Miss Danbury, Billie Young.

103
00:06:21,135 --> 00:06:23,933
Oh, yes, you worked for me
a couple of years ago, didn't you?

104
00:06:24,238 --> 00:06:26,604
Uh... No. I'm a defense attorney.

105
00:06:26,774 --> 00:06:29,902
Oh, pity. You look
like you got the right stuff.

106
00:06:30,078 --> 00:06:32,546
Oh, thanks. I mean...

107
00:06:32,714 --> 00:06:34,614
Oh, Miss Young.

108
00:06:34,782 --> 00:06:36,841
This way, Miss Danbury.

109
00:06:37,852 --> 00:06:39,717
- Hi there.
Hello.

110
00:06:39,887 --> 00:06:41,684
Are you my judge?

111
00:06:43,524 --> 00:06:45,048
Sir?

112
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:48,290
Why don't you go get your files, Billie?

113
00:06:48,463 --> 00:06:50,158
Why don't I?

114
00:06:50,531 --> 00:06:55,969
So, um, Harry, I understand
there's been a little misunderstanding...

115
00:06:56,137 --> 00:06:59,800
...concerning the, uh,
hostesses at my social club.

116
00:06:59,974 --> 00:07:01,305
Social club?

117
00:07:01,476 --> 00:07:06,675
Well, yes, my establishment is really
just a gathering place for lonely gentlemen.

118
00:07:06,848 --> 00:07:09,908
Out-of-town visitors
who merely wish to relax...

119
00:07:10,084 --> 00:07:12,951
...and have a pleasant conversation
with a friendly face.

120
00:07:13,388 --> 00:07:15,049
Sounds like the USO.

121
00:07:16,557 --> 00:07:19,185
We have better donuts.

122
00:07:21,028 --> 00:07:22,996
I bet.

123
00:07:23,798 --> 00:07:26,266
- Miss Young, is the defense ready?
- Ready, sir.

124
00:07:26,434 --> 00:07:28,698
Do the people
have an opening statement?

125
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:34,638
"I trembled with schoolgirl anticipation
as he pulled me onto the sofa.

126
00:07:34,809 --> 00:07:37,801
And the hand which had once waved
to cheering crowds...

127
00:07:37,979 --> 00:07:41,278
...now caressed my naked thigh."

128
00:07:42,049 --> 00:07:45,041
One of your better efforts, Mr. Fielding.

129
00:07:46,087 --> 00:07:48,385
Wait a minute, I wrote that.

130
00:07:48,556 --> 00:07:50,183
Thank you.

131
00:07:50,358 --> 00:07:54,727
Your Honor, it's a private memoir
that has nothing to do with this case.

132
00:07:54,896 --> 00:07:59,230
Yo, Your Honor, the people beg to differ,
and wish to submit into evidence...

133
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:03,837
...the unabridged and thoroughly
unadulterated diary of Miss Irene Danbury.

134
00:08:05,206 --> 00:08:07,470
All right, hose down, people.

135
00:08:07,642 --> 00:08:09,371
- Object.
- I object.

136
00:08:09,544 --> 00:08:11,136
- On what grounds?
- On what grounds?

137
00:08:11,312 --> 00:08:12,939
- It's personal.
- It's personal.

138
00:08:14,048 --> 00:08:17,643
Your Honor, I haven't even
had the chance to read that yet.

139
00:08:17,819 --> 00:08:21,550
I'm gonna sustain that, at least temporarily,
until we've had some copies made...

140
00:08:21,722 --> 00:08:24,122
...and you and I have had a chance
to take a gander.

141
00:08:24,292 --> 00:08:25,691
We'll take five, people.

142
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:27,327
Dan.

143
00:08:27,495 --> 00:08:29,929
Read it with someone you love.

144
00:08:44,579 --> 00:08:46,774
Would you try something like that?

145
00:08:48,149 --> 00:08:49,673
Yeah?

146
00:08:50,284 --> 00:08:51,649
You decent, sir?

147
00:08:51,819 --> 00:08:53,753
Come on in, Dan.

148
00:08:54,856 --> 00:08:56,050
What can I do for you?

149
00:08:56,224 --> 00:08:58,522
- You done with that yet?
- Just about.

150
00:08:58,693 --> 00:09:00,661
- This is really something, huh?
- Oh.

151
00:09:00,828 --> 00:09:04,787
I will never be able to look at chandeliers
the same way again.

152
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:07,494
Or the All-Star Game.

153
00:09:07,668 --> 00:09:10,296
Harry, there are some big,
big people in there.

154
00:09:10,471 --> 00:09:14,237
Athletes, politicians,
captains of industry.

155
00:09:14,408 --> 00:09:18,777
We could have a field day dragging
their good names through the mud.

156
00:09:18,946 --> 00:09:21,847
And so close to the holidays.

157
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:26,147
And perhaps we could further
our own careers in the process, eh, Dan?

158
00:09:26,821 --> 00:09:30,120
Oh, Harry, it's so right.

159
00:09:31,158 --> 00:09:32,648
- Your Honor?
- Come in.

160
00:09:32,827 --> 00:09:35,159
Hi.
- Oh, hi.

161
00:09:35,563 --> 00:09:38,430
Oh, I like your bird.

162
00:09:40,468 --> 00:09:42,060
Oh.

163
00:09:43,671 --> 00:09:44,695
Thanks.

164
00:09:44,872 --> 00:09:47,238
If I may cite some precedence
regarding the case...

165
00:09:47,408 --> 00:09:49,672
I'll listen to formal arguments
in court, Billie.

166
00:09:49,844 --> 00:09:52,711
Besides, I haven't even finished
the document in question yet.

167
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,474
The ending is predictable, sir.

168
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:59,484
- That will be all, Mr. Prosecutor.
- Yes, sir.

169
00:10:01,022 --> 00:10:02,614
Awesome.

170
00:10:05,726 --> 00:10:07,284
Ladies, if you'll excuse me?

171
00:10:07,728 --> 00:10:10,925
Sir, could I have a moment
alone with you, please?

172
00:10:11,098 --> 00:10:12,827
Well, Miss Danbury, I'm afraid...

173
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,764
Well, if you're afraid...

174
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:19,132
I suppose I can spare a moment.

175
00:10:19,307 --> 00:10:21,241
Thank you, sir.

176
00:10:21,943 --> 00:10:23,911
I'll meet you in court.

177
00:10:25,179 --> 00:10:27,443
- So, what can I do for you, Miss Danbury?
- Your...

178
00:10:28,816 --> 00:10:30,215
Yeah?

179
00:10:39,293 --> 00:10:41,318
Your Honor, I want my diary back.

180
00:10:41,495 --> 00:10:44,953
I'm afraid that's a legal decision
that I have not made yet.

181
00:10:45,132 --> 00:10:48,829
Look, that diary
is not just a bunch of papers.

182
00:10:49,003 --> 00:10:50,470
It's a part of me.

183
00:10:50,638 --> 00:10:53,630
It's everything I've been my whole life,
the good and the bad.

184
00:10:53,808 --> 00:10:55,469
I understand that, Miss Danbury.

185
00:10:56,077 --> 00:10:58,307
This could hurt a lot of people.

186
00:10:58,479 --> 00:11:00,242
People who trusted me.

187
00:11:00,414 --> 00:11:05,078
People who just needed a break
from the pressures of being somebody.

188
00:11:05,486 --> 00:11:07,386
I appreciate your sense of integrity.

189
00:11:07,555 --> 00:11:08,783
You can fine me.

190
00:11:08,956 --> 00:11:10,890
I'll even go to jail. I don't care.

191
00:11:11,359 --> 00:11:13,520
I'm afraid that
is not your decision to make.

192
00:11:13,694 --> 00:11:20,099
You see, there's a lot of material in here
that may be construed as incriminating.

193
00:11:22,336 --> 00:11:24,770
Have you read the chapter
about the famous architect?

194
00:11:24,939 --> 00:11:28,841
No. I'm just up to the
'76 convention. Oof.

195
00:11:29,744 --> 00:11:31,837
I think you'll enjoy it when you get to it.

196
00:11:32,013 --> 00:11:34,072
Well, listen, Miss Danbury,
I'm not a voyeur.

197
00:11:34,248 --> 00:11:36,614
I'm just doing my job.

198
00:11:37,184 --> 00:11:40,881
He came to me
just after his wife's accident.

199
00:11:41,322 --> 00:11:43,790
He was very much in love with her.

200
00:11:45,226 --> 00:11:47,694
But we all have needs.

201
00:11:47,862 --> 00:11:48,886
And so did he.

202
00:11:50,231 --> 00:11:52,222
He just cried most of the time, anyway...

203
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:56,837
...and after a while,
I even stopped accepting money.

204
00:11:57,505 --> 00:12:03,375
The point is, Harry, he loved her then,
he loves her now.

205
00:12:03,878 --> 00:12:06,506
Please, don't betray his trust in me.

206
00:12:09,517 --> 00:12:11,485
Your Honor, everybody's ready to go.

207
00:12:11,652 --> 00:12:13,449
Thanks, Selma.

208
00:12:13,854 --> 00:12:16,186
I appreciate your allowing me
these few moments.

209
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:17,784
It was my pleasure.

210
00:12:19,093 --> 00:12:20,685
You have a wonderful judge there.

211
00:12:20,861 --> 00:12:22,328
Cigarette?

212
00:12:22,496 --> 00:12:23,793
No, thanks.

213
00:12:23,964 --> 00:12:26,125
Just checking.

214
00:12:34,375 --> 00:12:37,003
I have reviewed the material in question.

215
00:12:38,679 --> 00:12:41,079
And as it's clearly germane
to the case before me...

216
00:12:41,248 --> 00:12:45,150
...I rule for the people, and I will allow
this document entered into evidence.

217
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:49,489
But first, we will take a dinner break.

218
00:12:49,657 --> 00:12:52,490
Court will reconvene in one hour.

219
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:54,457
All rise.

220
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:10,804
I got you some coffee.

221
00:13:10,978 --> 00:13:13,208
Oh, thank you, Billie.

222
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:16,474
Look, I'm really sorry. I should've
come up with something better.

223
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:18,914
Oh, that's okay. You did your best.

224
00:13:19,086 --> 00:13:21,054
That's all I expect from any of my girls.

225
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:25,058
Well, look, this thing isn't over yet.

226
00:13:25,926 --> 00:13:27,894
I'll be back in court.

227
00:13:36,737 --> 00:13:38,637
You know,
I thought she would never leave.

228
00:13:38,806 --> 00:13:41,001
- My name's Craven, from...
- I don't wanna talk.

229
00:13:41,175 --> 00:13:43,803
My paper has authorized me
to offer you a sum of money...

230
00:13:43,978 --> 00:13:47,004
...for the exclusive serialization rights
to your life story.

231
00:13:47,181 --> 00:13:48,910
And I don't usually pay for it.

232
00:13:52,086 --> 00:13:54,179
You must be very lonely.

233
00:13:54,722 --> 00:13:56,349
Well, yes. Uh...

234
00:13:57,091 --> 00:13:58,456
Get lost, Craven.

235
00:13:58,626 --> 00:14:02,118
- No, I wanna hear it from her.
- Get lost, Craven.

236
00:14:02,296 --> 00:14:04,127
Enough said.

237
00:14:08,235 --> 00:14:09,793
Starting already, huh?

238
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:11,403
Yeah, starting already.

239
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:15,031
You know, Irene, I had no choice.

240
00:14:15,209 --> 00:14:17,234
The law is very clear in the matter.

241
00:14:18,479 --> 00:14:19,810
I understand.

242
00:14:22,049 --> 00:14:24,779
Sometimes I wish
I'd stuck with the accordion.

243
00:14:24,952 --> 00:14:28,046
I could be annoying people
at a wedding now.

244
00:14:28,722 --> 00:14:30,485
We all make our beds.

245
00:14:30,658 --> 00:14:32,558
You got a nifty way with words, Irene.

246
00:14:34,028 --> 00:14:36,428
I have to. I do a lot of talking.

247
00:14:36,597 --> 00:14:38,861
That's all most of our clients
want to do, anyway.

248
00:14:39,033 --> 00:14:40,159
- Really?
- Sure.

249
00:14:40,334 --> 00:14:42,427
They talk about their wives and kids.

250
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:45,200
They ask advice about things.

251
00:14:45,372 --> 00:14:47,340
"What should I do about my job?

252
00:14:47,508 --> 00:14:49,169
How can I improve my appearance?

253
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:52,039
Should I drop out of the primaries?"

254
00:14:52,213 --> 00:14:53,703
Sounds fascinating.

255
00:14:53,881 --> 00:14:56,441
I can remember this Air Force general,
four stars...

256
00:14:56,617 --> 00:14:58,517
...although personally
I'd only give him two.

257
00:14:58,686 --> 00:14:59,914
The guy on page 48?

258
00:15:01,622 --> 00:15:04,648
Oh, I'm good with phone numbers too.

259
00:15:05,326 --> 00:15:09,592
Yeah, he used to come up every Sunday
with this cute little attaché case...

260
00:15:09,763 --> 00:15:14,393
...handcuffed to his wrist, and all he ever
wanted to talk about was his bombers.

261
00:15:14,568 --> 00:15:16,001
Bombers? What bombers?

262
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:19,731
Oh, I don't know,
it was the B-54 this, the C-31 that.

263
00:15:19,907 --> 00:15:22,273
I think there were a bunch of F-1 s too.

264
00:15:22,443 --> 00:15:24,536
Bombers. That's it.

265
00:15:24,712 --> 00:15:26,680
I gotta go. Bye.

266
00:15:29,984 --> 00:15:31,975
When you're done, you're done.

267
00:15:39,927 --> 00:15:42,691
Come on, heel, Skip, heel.

268
00:15:44,632 --> 00:15:45,894
Attaboy.

269
00:15:46,066 --> 00:15:47,294
You're very good with him.

270
00:15:47,468 --> 00:15:48,992
Thank you.

271
00:15:49,637 --> 00:15:51,366
Sit.

272
00:15:52,973 --> 00:15:54,941
Still working on that one.

273
00:15:55,409 --> 00:15:56,740
I have a pet bat.

274
00:15:56,911 --> 00:15:58,401
We keep the same hours.

275
00:16:04,218 --> 00:16:06,482
Uh, actually, Skippy's not my pet.

276
00:16:06,654 --> 00:16:08,121
He's gonna be somebody's dinner.

277
00:16:08,856 --> 00:16:10,050
Oh...

278
00:16:10,224 --> 00:16:12,590
Poor little fuzzy buzzard.

279
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,751
Oh, I'll be okay.

280
00:16:17,932 --> 00:16:18,956
Come on, Skippy.

281
00:16:19,133 --> 00:16:21,294
Walkies, walkies.

282
00:16:21,468 --> 00:16:22,958
Walkies.

283
00:16:23,137 --> 00:16:24,866
Come on, Fielding, what's the holdup?

284
00:16:25,039 --> 00:16:26,768
- Got an 11:00 deadline.
- Yeah, me too.

285
00:16:26,941 --> 00:16:29,000
Gentlemen, Judge Stone
will be out soon.

286
00:16:29,176 --> 00:16:32,236
In the meantime, I'd be glad to answer
any more of your questions.

287
00:16:32,413 --> 00:16:33,744
Dan Fielding.

288
00:16:33,914 --> 00:16:39,079
Aren't you the one that ran for city council
last year against the dead guy and lost?

289
00:16:42,022 --> 00:16:45,287
No, no, no. That was Dan Fielding.

290
00:16:45,459 --> 00:16:47,017
- Oh.
- Excuse me.

291
00:16:51,065 --> 00:16:52,930
All rise.

292
00:16:53,667 --> 00:16:56,227
Manhattan Criminal Court Part 2
is now in session...

293
00:16:56,403 --> 00:16:59,338
...the Honorable Harold T. Stone
presiding.

294
00:17:02,977 --> 00:17:04,569
You look a little nervous, sir.

295
00:17:04,745 --> 00:17:07,509
Bombers, Mac, bombers.

296
00:17:07,681 --> 00:17:10,241
I'm sure they're ours, sir.

297
00:17:10,918 --> 00:17:12,351
You may be seated.

298
00:17:13,187 --> 00:17:15,178
Your Honor,
the people are ready to proceed.

299
00:17:15,356 --> 00:17:17,881
Your Honor, before we begin,
the defense asks...

300
00:17:18,058 --> 00:17:21,585
...that you reconsider your decision
on Miss Danbury's private papers.

301
00:17:21,762 --> 00:17:24,390
I mean, surely you can
appreciate the confidentiality...

302
00:17:24,565 --> 00:17:28,331
...as in lawyer-client privilege,
as well as doctor-patient, priest-penitent...

303
00:17:28,502 --> 00:17:31,403
Uh, Your Honor, while the people
certainly respect the sanctity...

304
00:17:31,572 --> 00:17:35,303
...of the bimbo-bimbee relationship...

305
00:17:35,476 --> 00:17:39,674
...we heartily agree
with the ruling you already made.

306
00:17:40,347 --> 00:17:42,815
Let's proceed, huh, people?

307
00:17:44,351 --> 00:17:49,914
Now, uh, in considering this case,
I did some research into diaries.

308
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:53,389
There is, of course,
the diary of Anne Frank...

309
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:56,688
...the diary of Roderick,
Last of the Goths...

310
00:17:56,864 --> 00:17:57,853
...uh...

311
00:17:58,032 --> 00:18:01,661
...the, uh, Guadalcanal Diary...

312
00:18:01,835 --> 00:18:04,770
<i>...uh, the Diary of a Teenage Hitchhiker...</i>

313
00:18:04,938 --> 00:18:08,772
Your Honor, with all due respect,
we have a backlog of cases building up.

314
00:18:09,143 --> 00:18:10,906
Point well taken, Mr. Prosecutor.

315
00:18:11,078 --> 00:18:15,174
<i>And it was
Portrait of a Teenage Hitchhiker.</i>

316
00:18:15,783 --> 00:18:17,410
- Well, then, let's proceed.
- Indeed.

317
00:18:17,584 --> 00:18:19,211
Now, Your Honor, the people would...

318
00:18:19,386 --> 00:18:21,980
Hey. Hi, guys. Over here.

319
00:18:24,058 --> 00:18:27,858
Judge Stone? Major Roy Pritchard,
United States Air Force Intelligence.

320
00:18:28,028 --> 00:18:30,326
Good to see you. Hey, great hat.

321
00:18:30,497 --> 00:18:32,465
- Beg your pardon?
- This will take a minute.

322
00:18:32,633 --> 00:18:36,262
You folks can murmur excitedly
amongst yourselves.

323
00:18:37,771 --> 00:18:39,636
Do you know this Air Force joker?

324
00:18:40,007 --> 00:18:41,702
A major? Ha.

325
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:43,775
You've got to be kidding.

326
00:18:45,379 --> 00:18:48,007
Folks, I have an announcement.

327
00:18:48,816 --> 00:18:51,080
Having briefly reviewed excerpts
from the diary...

328
00:18:51,251 --> 00:18:53,811
...Major Pritchard
has made a preliminary judgment...

329
00:18:53,987 --> 00:18:57,980
...that disclosure of said diary could pose
a threat to national-security interests...

330
00:18:58,158 --> 00:19:03,027
...and so has temporarily classified
the document and its copies as secret.

331
00:19:03,197 --> 00:19:05,722
You may react briefly.

332
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,890
Your Honor, what does this mean?

333
00:19:08,068 --> 00:19:09,763
It means I'll take that.

334
00:19:09,937 --> 00:19:11,996
This is mine.

335
00:19:12,172 --> 00:19:13,434
Dan, give him the book.

336
00:19:17,077 --> 00:19:19,875
- Defense will surrender her copy.
- With pleasure, Your Honor.

337
00:19:20,047 --> 00:19:23,813
And may I remind both of you,
pending the final decision in this matter...

338
00:19:23,984 --> 00:19:27,784
...you will not discuss, disclose,
or in any way disseminate the contents...

339
00:19:27,955 --> 00:19:31,015
...of this document,
under the severe penalty of law.

340
00:19:31,191 --> 00:19:34,160
- What...? Your Honor, I object.
- Overruled.

341
00:19:34,328 --> 00:19:35,693
- Exception.
- Noted.

342
00:19:35,863 --> 00:19:38,627
- Frustration.
- Vented.

343
00:19:40,701 --> 00:19:42,601
- Good evening, Your Honor.
Thanks, major.

344
00:19:42,769 --> 00:19:44,327
Ma'am.

345
00:19:44,505 --> 00:19:45,904
Counselor.

346
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:51,937
All right, people, that's enough.

347
00:19:52,112 --> 00:19:56,412
Mr. Prosecutor, do you have any
other evidence to present in this case?

348
00:19:56,583 --> 00:19:59,143
Yeah. I got that boring stuff.

349
00:20:00,621 --> 00:20:04,250
The financial reports, the police records.

350
00:20:04,424 --> 00:20:06,892
I respectfully submit them.

351
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:08,152
Miss Young?

352
00:20:08,929 --> 00:20:10,760
You are terrific.

353
00:20:11,565 --> 00:20:16,593
I mean, Your Honor, the defense has
nothing more and moves for a finding.

354
00:20:17,404 --> 00:20:19,998
The court finds the defendant
guilty as charged.

355
00:20:20,174 --> 00:20:23,041
Thirty days suspended and a $500 fine.

356
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:24,677
And the court is adjourned.

357
00:20:24,845 --> 00:20:26,039
Wow!

358
00:20:26,213 --> 00:20:28,340
We won.

359
00:20:31,185 --> 00:20:35,645
Don't ever touch me
without a note from your doctor.

360
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:41,921
Harry?

361
00:20:44,031 --> 00:20:46,022
Do I give you the $500?

362
00:20:46,466 --> 00:20:48,957
That'd be a switch, wouldn't it?

363
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:51,435
I think you're worth it.

364
00:20:53,073 --> 00:20:55,507
Well, you just pay the clerk downstairs.

365
00:20:58,512 --> 00:21:00,104
Thank you.

366
00:21:00,781 --> 00:21:02,908
I hope I never see you again.

367
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:04,812
I mean, at least not here.

368
00:21:05,185 --> 00:21:07,585
Oh, no, I'm thinking of retiring.

369
00:21:07,754 --> 00:21:10,848
The social-club business
just ain't what it used to be.

370
00:21:11,024 --> 00:21:12,252
Glad to hear it.

371
00:21:12,426 --> 00:21:14,189
Maybe I'll move upstate.

372
00:21:14,361 --> 00:21:18,229
I've had my eye on this little country inn
near West Point.

373
00:21:18,398 --> 00:21:19,831
Good luck.

374
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:23,326
You know, this may be a little cliché...

375
00:21:23,503 --> 00:21:27,837
...but I think
if I had met you 20 years ago...

376
00:21:28,008 --> 00:21:30,568
...my life would've turned out
a lot differently.

377
00:21:31,144 --> 00:21:32,975
Mine too.

378
00:21:34,014 --> 00:21:36,312
I was 14.

379
00:21:37,951 --> 00:21:40,010
Good night, Harry.

380
00:21:43,457 --> 00:21:46,153
Good night, Irene.

381
00:21:47,628 --> 00:21:49,061
She's quite a gal, isn't she?

382
00:21:52,666 --> 00:21:54,725
Is this real wood?

383
00:21:56,169 --> 00:21:57,761
Um...

384
00:22:02,075 --> 00:22:03,599
So happy Thanksgiving, everybody.

385
00:22:03,777 --> 00:22:05,301
- Right.
- Happy Thanksgiving.

386
00:22:05,479 --> 00:22:07,777
Yeah, gobble, gobble.

387
00:22:07,948 --> 00:22:11,213
Oh, Dan, you're not still sore
about that gag order, are you?

388
00:22:11,385 --> 00:22:17,346
No, no, no. But, you know,
a filthy mind is a terrible thing to waste.

389
00:22:18,959 --> 00:22:21,189
Hey, Mac.
- Good evening, folks.

390
00:22:21,728 --> 00:22:24,196
What, uh, Bull's out
walking my bird again?

391
00:22:24,364 --> 00:22:25,388
I don't know.

392
00:22:25,565 --> 00:22:28,090
He took Skippy up on the roof.

393
00:22:28,268 --> 00:22:31,203
- What?
- He said he was gonna set him free.

394
00:22:31,371 --> 00:22:32,804
Set him free?

395
00:22:32,973 --> 00:22:35,840
Hey, man, turkeys don't fly.

396
00:22:36,009 --> 00:22:39,809
I knew there was something
I wanted to tell him.

397
00:22:57,998 --> 00:23:02,367
Runnies, runnies, runnies.
