00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,380
在这样的天气下
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}In weather like this,

111
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:04,640
你穿着不合适的衣服在外面待了五分钟
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}you're out there for five minutes with improper attire,

112
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:07,750
一会儿你唯一能搭的车
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and well, the only ride you're gonna need

113
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:10,550
就是去欧克莱尔验尸官那里的车
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}is to the coroner's in Eau Claire.

114
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:14,140
我正要进城买件外套
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I was walking into town to buy a jacket.

115
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,500
幸好你长得帅
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It's a good thing you're pretty.

116
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:23,290
看看这辆漂亮的老古董
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Ah! Look at the beautiful clunker.

117
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:25,080

{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Clunker?

118
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:27,000
每年  我们找一辆报废的车
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Every year, we take a wreck,

119
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,730
把它放在湖面上
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}we put it out on the lake,

120
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:31,660
然后  大家会猜测春天将至时
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and then, folks guess the date and the time

121
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:34,210
废车压破冰面的日期和时间
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}when it'll break through the ice come spring.

122
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:37,120
然后  获胜者和高中平分奖金
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And then, the winner splits the pot with the high school.

123
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,960
真的很有趣
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It's really fun.

你会喜欢的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You're gonna love it.

但你知道这地方最特别的是什么吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}But you know what really makes this place special?

132
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,720
是人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}The people.

{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Everyone here genuinely cares for their neighbor.

134
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:03,600
这是我们一切行为的出发点
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It's in everything we do.

135
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,380
这种精神是由本镇第一位
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}This spirit was passed down to us

136
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:11,380
居民及资助人莱斯特·汉密尔顿传给我们的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}by the town's first citizen and benefactor, Lester Hamilton.

137
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:15,130
他死后  将财产留给了湖畔镇
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And when he died, he left Lakeside his fortune

138
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:18,430
于是镇民才能继续繁荣昌盛
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}so that its citizens would continue to prosper.

139
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:20,890
他只要求我们尊重
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}All he asked in return was that we honor

140
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:24,080
一些他最喜欢的旧世界传统
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}some of his favorite Old World traditions.

141
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:27,000
所以每年我们都会举办一个冰雪节
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}So every year, we hold an ice festival

142
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:29,320
来庆祝他的慷慨
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}to celebrate his generosity

143
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:32,710
感谢我们神奇的小镇

{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}At the Koliada?

226
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:22,080
是的  没错
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Oh, yeah.

228
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:23,770
芝加哥
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Chicago.

229
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:26,510
为了卓娅·维切恩亚亚
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}For Zorya Vechernyaya.

230
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:28,010
不能等到那个时候吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Couldn't wait 'til then?

231
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:30,610
起诉战争是一个费时费力的差事
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Prosecuting the war is an all-consuming endeavor.

232
00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:33,710
总有事情在最后一刻出现
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Things come up all the time, last minute.

233
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:35,020
虽然追悼会是好的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Memorials are all well and good,

234
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:37,720
但是我们都知道以牙还牙
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}but we both know that an eye for an eye

235
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,650
并不便宜
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}don't come cheap.

236
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:44,160
一切为了事业
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Well, anything for the cause.

237
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:45,990
我该署名
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Should I make it out to...?

238
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:47,800
卡什[现金]就好了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}"Cash" Will be just fine.

想得美
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Nice try.

244
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:34,780
早上好啊  萨尔
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Oh, top of the morning to you, Sal!

245
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:37,290
好了  我说到哪了  对
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}All right, where was I? Oh, right!

246

湖畔新闻社就在那边
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Okay, Lakeside News is just down that-a-way.

{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It was started by Zachary Morgan in 1902.

248
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:46,590
他得了梅毒  穿着尿不湿死的  可怜的家伙
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}He died of syphilis wearing a diaper, poor fella.

249
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:48,810
真不错  其实
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Nice. Um, so actually...

250
00:21:48,810 --> 00:21:51,700
安迪  但愿你是在给你老婆买礼物
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Andy! I hope you're looking for a present for your wife!

251
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:54,160
你们两个的结婚纪念日马上到了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Your anniversary is coming up.

252
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:56,370
他经常忘记一些事情
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}He happens to forget things

253
00:21:56,370 --> 00:21:59,390
像结婚纪念日这种  一年一次的婚姻事件
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}like annual marital events, like anniversaries.

254
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,060
梅宝家餐馆就在这边
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Mabel's Restaurant is right over here,

255
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:03,340
那里的馅饼  就像我之前说的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and the pasties, as I mentioned earlier,

256
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:05,140
简直棒极了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}are the best things ever.

257
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:07,350
你知道吗  她传承了她奶奶的配方
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You know, she inherited the recipe from her grandmother,

258
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:09,880
而她奶奶是从康沃尔郡带来的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}who brought it over here from Cornwall.

259
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,010
我能不能快速插一句
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}If I could just sneak in

260
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:12,590
问一下我在哪里能租一辆车
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}a quick question about where to rent a car.

261
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:13,740
那你应该找欧克莱尔  那
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Oh, that's Eau Claire, that...

262
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:16,350
我从玛莎那里听说凯西的内衣被偷了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I heard from Martha that Kathy's unmentionables were stolen

263
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,090
而且是直接从洗衣篮里偷的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}right from her laundry basket!

264
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:18,420
我知道  我知道
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I know, I know, I know.

265
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,700
我们先不要因为一点点谣言
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Let's not all get in a fuss

266
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:21,960
就大惊小怪的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}over the Piggly Wiggly rumor mill.

267
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:24,470
-你好啊  安玛丽  -你好  柴德
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Oh, hey, Ann-Marie. - Hi, Chad.

268
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:27,220
迈克  看起来李·亨宁斯把你照顾得挺好啊
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Oh, Mike. I see Lee Henning's taken good care of you.

269
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,830
现在你看起来更像本地人了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Now you're lookin' more local.

270
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:30,140
至少暖和了不少
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Lot warmer at least.

271
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:32,680
梅格·冈瑟在激动什么呢
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What's Meg Gunther in a lather about?

272
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:34,380
内衣
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Lingerie.

273
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:38,030
显然  她的一周一轮的内衣丢了三套
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Apparently, three pairs of her days-of-the-week underwear:

274
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:40,230
星期三的  星期四的和星期六的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Wednesday, Thursday, and Saturday,

275
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:42,570
全从烘干机里消失了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}all went missing from the dryer.

276
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:47,450
所以她就认为  我们有一个  在逃内衣贼
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}So, in her mind, we have a, uh, panty thief on the loose.

277
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,640
你看  迈克  这就算得上
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}See, Mike, this is what qualifies

278
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:52,130
湖畔镇的重罪了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}as major crime here in Lakeside.

279
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:54,380
俗话说得好  如果你有钱  你在蒙特卡洛生活
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You know, if you're rich, you live in Monte Carlo.

280
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:56,270
如果你出名  就住在加州
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And if you're famous, you live in California.

281
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:59,520
但是如果你很幸运  那你就住在这  湖畔镇
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}But if you're lucky, you live here in... in Lakeside.

282
00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:02,630
该死  我要去水湾那里找巴特了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Oh, shoot. I'm supposed to meet Bart up at the inlet.

283
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:04,830
太抱歉了  柴德
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I am so sorry. Um, hey, Chad,

284
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:08,070
你能不能带我们的新人去尝尝馅饼
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}could you get our newest resident situated with a pasty?

285
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:09,260
你根本不用再问我第二遍
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Oh, you don't have to ask me twice.

286
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:10,910
-我要饿死了  -太好了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- I'm starving. - Okay.

287
00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:12,380

288
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:14,020
-谢谢你  -你肯定会喜欢的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Thank you. - You're gonna love it.

289
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:15,930
你知道吗  有趣的是
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You know, interestingly, uh,

290
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:18,050

{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Mabel's amazing pasty recipe,

291
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:19,930

{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}she actually inherited from her grandmother.

292
00:23:19,930 --> 00:23:21,870
大老远从康沃尔郡来的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Came all the way from Cornwall.

293
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,300

{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}He's staying up at the spot on Gorman.

297
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:30,510
很高兴认识你  迈克
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It's nice to meet you, Mike.

298
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:32,560
要看看菜单吗  亲爱的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Can I show you a menu, hon?

299
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:35,740
大家都在说馅饼
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Well, everyone's been talking about these pasties.

300
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:38,510
一份馅饼  店里赠送
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}One pasty on the house it is.

301
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:40,990
免费赠送给第一次光顾的顾客

{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Don't leave me hanging, dawg.

308
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:02,760
你认识德瑞克吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You know Derek?

309
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:05,050
不认识
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No.

310
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:08,540
我觉得他只是想让我知道有他这么个人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I think he just wants me to know he's down.

311
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:14,410
你是做什么工作的  迈克
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}So, what do you do for a living, Mike?

312
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:19,100

{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Just working for my uncle right now.

他是做什么的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What's he do?

314
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:22,610
他做进出口贸易
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}He runs an import-export business.

315
00:24:22,610 --> 00:24:25,140
是吗  哪一种
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yeah? What kind?

316
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:29,490
大部分都是古董
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Antiques, mostly.

317
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:34,760
我语气像警察问话  对吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I sound like a cop, don't I?

318
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:35,290
有一点
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Little bit.

319
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:37,000
习惯成自然
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yeah, that's a force of habit.

320
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:37,900
天啊  迈克  对不起
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Jeez, Mike, I'm sorry.

321
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:39,890

吃的来了  先生们
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Here you go, gents.

谢谢
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Thank you.

324
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,710
小心点
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Now, careful.

325
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:44,900
如果你饿着肚子离开这里
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}If you leave here hungry,

326
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:47,130
那就是你自己的错
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}it's your own dang fault.

327
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:54,410
真好吃
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}So good.

328
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:56,090
小心  这些会上瘾的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Careful. They're addictive.

329
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:57,750
你也许知道
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You might know.

330
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:02,810
有比欧克莱尔更近的租车地方吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Is there anywhere closer than Eau Claire to rent a car?

{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}of Zorya Vechernyaya.

458
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,970
不许你提她的名字
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hey, you take that name out of your mouth.

459
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:49,510
现在不是说这些的时候
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Oh, this is not the place or the time...

460
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:52,050
沃坦  听好了  这是你的错
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Votan! Listen, you did this.

461
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:54,350
你基本上等同于扣下了扳机
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You as good as pulled the trigger of the gun

462
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:55,160
结束了她的生命
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}that ended her life.

463
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,960
她是被共同的敌人谋杀的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}She was murdered by shared enemies.

464
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,480
你好大的胆子  沃坦
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}The balls on you, Votan.

465
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:03,030
你是来向卓娅致敬的吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Are you here to pay your respect to Zorya?

466
00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:06,010
我觉得不是  你来是为了你那愚蠢的战争
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I don't think so. You're here because of your stupid war.

467
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:07,870
这是罪过吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Is that a sin?

468
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:10,100
我来这里是为了悼念
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I came here to mourn the death

469
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:12,900
我曾心爱之人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}of someone who once owned my heart,

470
00:34:12,910 --> 00:34:15,340
同时发现自己周围站满了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and at the same time find myself surrounded

471
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:17,620
斯拉夫不同种族的神明
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}by Slavic deities of every stripe.

472
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:21,370
能被召集于我们旗下的盟友
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}A cotillion of allies to be recruited to our cause.

473
00:34:21,370 --> 00:34:25,310
还是说  你忘了我们的事业
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Or... have you forgotten our cause?

474
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:26,800
你是不是忘记了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Has it slipped your mind

475
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,740
你  岑诺伯格  夜神
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}that you, Czernobog, the Dark One,

476
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:31,880

477
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:36,370
敬晚间之星
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}To the evening star.

478
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:42,630
敬晚间之星
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}To the evening star.

479
00:34:58,390 --> 00:34:59,600
我喜欢你的发型
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I like the hair.

看起来很有型
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Much better look.

481
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,810
改头换面的时候到了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It was time for a change.

482
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:09,040
你把硬币带来了吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Did you bring the coin?

483
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:10,740
是的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yeah.

484
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:14,290
我走到哪里都带着
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I carry it everywhere.

485
00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:16,120
因为你和它一样
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Because you are just like it.

486
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:20,560
总是一半在光明  一半在黑暗之中
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Always half in light, half in shadow.

487
00:35:22,010 --> 00:35:24,950
你有一部分总是不肯示人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Part of you always hidden from sight.

488
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:27,630
星象告诉我们
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}The stars tell that a day

489
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:30,110
总有一天你会面对两个选择
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}is coming when you will face two paths.

490
00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:35,130
你必须选择自己的命运
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You must choose which way your destiny unfolds.

491
00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:41,920
我唯一想要的命运就是正常的生活
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}The only destiny I want is a normal life.

492
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:45,560
你这么说  但是
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You say that, but...

493
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:50,400
你的思维和心灵并不统一
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}...your head and your heart are not in agreement.

494
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,820
你的一半来自于全能的父
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Half of you comes from the All-Father.

495
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:58,200
它诱惑你  他的权力
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It tempts you. His power,

496
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:01,240
他的过去
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}his... history.

497
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:05,940
好吧  告诉你我想要什么
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Okay, this is what I want.

498
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:10,180
我不想再猜谜了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I want no more riddles.

499
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:14,910
你懂吗  不再有含义模糊的答案
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You know? No... no more cryptic answers.

500
00:36:15,830 --> 00:36:18,260
星象只能揭示这么多
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}The stars can only reveal so much.

501
00:36:20,170 --> 00:36:23,570
但是  当你迷茫的时候
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}But, when you cannot see your way,

502
00:36:23,930 --> 00:36:25,800
夜空会指引你
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}the night sky will guide you.

503
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:35,270
这才值得我跑一趟
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}That was worth the drive.

504
00:37:28,790 --> 00:37:31,180
那些新众神
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Ah, these New Gods,

505
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,620
杀了我们挚爱的卓娅
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}that killed our beloved Zorya,

506
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:38,430
如果他们想要战争  那就开战
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}if they want a war, bring me war, huh?

507
00:37:41,430 --> 00:37:43,420
现在听我说  岑诺伯格
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Now, hear me, Czernobog!

508
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:46,960
我  沃坦  全能的父
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I, Votan, the All-Father,

509
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,750
发誓为卓娅的死报仇!
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}swear to avenge Zorya's death!

510
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:54,010
邀请所有人  还有所有热血沸腾的混蛋
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And invite all, and any, hot-blooded bastards

511
00:37:54,010 --> 00:37:57,820
帮助恢复真神的荣耀
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}to help restore honor to the true gods!

512
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:17,120
除了我  他真的邀请了所有人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}He really did invite everyone but me.

513
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:25,150
偷得不错
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Nice lift.

514
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:27,050
我不知道你在说什么
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I don't know what you're talking about.

515
00:38:27,050 --> 00:38:30,510
那个明信片  我不会注意到吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}The postcard. What, I wouldn't notice?

516
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,770
但在你去拜访她之前
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}But before you pay her a visit,

517
00:38:32,770 --> 00:38:35,390
问问自己能给她带去什么
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}ask yourself if you have anything to offer her

518
00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:36,300
除了心痛
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}except for heartache.

519
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:37,920
管好你自己
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Stay in your fucking lane.

520
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:49,880
我的孩子
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}My boy.

521
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,310
你个混蛋  星期三
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You asshole, Wednesday!

522
00:38:56,730 --> 00:38:58,000
你骗了我
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You lied to me!

523
00:38:59,310 --> 00:39:01,590
也愿你平安  兄弟
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Oh, well, now, "Salaam aleikum" To you too, brother.

524
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:04,120
见鬼去吧  你把他送走了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}The hell with that! You sent him away!

525
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:05,600
我没有
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I did not!

526
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,130
那个鸡奸者讨厌我
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}That sodomite hates me

527
00:39:07,130 --> 00:39:09,400
对我恨之入骨
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}with every hair on his chinny-chin-chin.

528
00:39:09,730 --> 00:39:12,410
求你了  我要找到他
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Please. I need to find him.

529
00:39:12,410 --> 00:39:15,490
在他甩了你之后吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}After the way he pumped and dumped you?

530
00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:17,040
算了吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Get over it.

531
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:29,750
你应该让妖精杀了他
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You should have let the leprechaun kill him.

532
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:32,950
有一天你会感谢我的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}One day you'll thank me.

533
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:38,000

{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm, uh... I'm out.

534
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,830
回湖畔镇
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Back to Lakeside?

535
00:39:39,830 --> 00:39:41,690
那地方越来越吸引你了  不是吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}The place grows on you, doesn't it?

536
00:39:41,690 --> 00:39:43,670
几乎被冻死两次
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Nearly froze to death twice

537
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:45,560
又差点被爆头
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and almost got my head blown off.

538
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:46,980
但没错  食物很好
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}But, yeah, food's good.

我觉得我的车很性感
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I thought my ride was sexy.

541
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:20,780
你在做什么
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What's your hustle?

542
00:40:21,690 --> 00:40:23,090
你是被包养了吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You a sugar baby?

543
00:40:24,010 --> 00:40:26,070
你和金主有问题吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You got daddy issues?

544
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:27,450
我只是在做我自己
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm just doing me.

545
00:40:27,450 --> 00:40:28,630
那是什么
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Which means what?

546
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,860
扮演老男人的未婚妻
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Playing the old man's fiancee?

547
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,120
那不是
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}That would be a no.

548
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,880
我是女队的一员
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm on the all-girls squad.

549
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:42,470

{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}So, how'd you end up with him?

550
00:40:42,610 --> 00:40:44,660
他在克雷格列表网上发的贴子太棒了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Oh, his Craigslist post was dope,

551
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:47,390
所以我回复「有兴趣」
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}so I replied, "Interested".

552
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000

{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}All right. You know what?

555
00:40:54,210 --> 00:40:55,200
我不在乎
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I don't care.

556
00:40:55,390 --> 00:40:56,510
我大三的时候
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}My junior year of Hunter,

557
00:40:56,510 --> 00:40:59,490
被开除了  因为做黑客被捕了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I got kicked out, arrested for hacking.

558
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:01,510
我欠了一屁股债
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Up to my ass in debt.

559
00:41:03,110 --> 00:41:04,750
完美的工作
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}When along comes the perfect job,

560
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:06,130

{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}right when I needed it.

561
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:08,850
克雷格列表
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Craigslist.

562
00:41:09,950 --> 00:41:12,250
他帮我付清了律师费和学费
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}He paid off my legal bills and tuition.

563
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:16,690
我帮他处理高科技的事
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I help him with... um, tech stuff.

564
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:19,000
好消息是
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Well, the good news is,

565
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,870

{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}on account of me, you can now reach your old man,

566
00:41:21,870 --> 00:41:23,200
无论何时
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}day or night.

567
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,150
电话亭是怎么回事
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What happened to the phone booths?

568
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:27,930
是吧  海拉程序
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Right? Hella progress.

569
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:34,630
听着  我和我老爸有很多麻烦事
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Look, I got all sorts of shit with my old man,

570
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:36,130
但也许你可以考虑一下你爸爸
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}but maybe consider your Pops

571
00:41:36,130 --> 00:41:38,330
不完全是个混蛋
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}isn't a complete fucking asshole.

572
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:42,220
这有点困难
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Now, that is a stretch.

573
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:44,090
我懂
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I hear you.

574
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:47,630
如果你需要一个朋友聊聊
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}But if you ever need a friendly voice,

575
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:49,100
我知道  不是他
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I get it, not him,

576
00:41:49,770 --> 00:41:51,050
打给那个号码吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}just call the number.

577

你起码会接通我
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You'll get me, at least.

578
00:41:56,890 --> 00:42:00,660
好吧  听着  当事情变得难以处理时
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}All right, listen. When it all gets too much to handle,

579
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:02,180
总会这样的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and it will.

580

一样的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Likewise.

581

怎么了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yes?

586
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:02,120
如果我再点馅饼的话
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}If I have another one of those pasties,

587
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:03,030
恐怕吃四个都不够
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm gonna want four more.

588
00:43:03,030 --> 00:43:04,540
所以我还是悠着点
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}So I am gonna take it easy

589

这次我就点

培根配小麦土司吧

00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:14,540
我得问你几个问题
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm gonna have to ask you some questions.

596
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:22,960
你下午四点出发去芝加哥
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You left for Chicago about 4 p.m.

597
00:44:23,150 --> 00:44:25,060
离开镇子之前停车加油了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You stop for gas before you left town?

谢谢
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Thank you.

对
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yeah.

在小镇大街的西铁古加油站

601
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:36,610
怎么了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What's up?

602
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:44,290
艾莉森·麦戈文昨天没去上学
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Alison McGovern didn't show up to school

603
00:44:44,290 --> 00:44:45,830
也没去上班
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}or work yesterday.

604
00:44:46,630 --> 00:44:47,850
她前天在亨宁斯店里下班之后
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No one's seen or heard from her

605
00:44:47,850 --> 00:44:51,890
再就没人见过她  也没有过她的消息
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}since her shift ended at Hennings the previous day.

606
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:57,310
迈克  要知道  这不是针对你
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Gotta understand, Mike, this is nothing personal.

607
00:44:58,460 --> 00:45:00,710
我们要梳理一下你过去72小时的行踪
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We're going to go over your whereabouts for the past 72.

608
00:45:00,710 --> 00:45:04,220
而且迈克  我需要你说得越详细越好
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And Mike, I need you be as specific as you can.

609
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:06,020
没问题  去芝加哥
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Sure. It took about

610
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:08,470
用了差不多七个小时
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}seven hours to get to Chicago.

611
00:45:09,510 --> 00:45:11,650
你是去参加追悼会的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You were there for a memorial service.

612
00:45:11,650 --> 00:45:13,810
是家人吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}This a family member?

613
00:45:13,870 --> 00:45:15,280
我叔叔的朋友
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Friend of my uncle's.

614
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:18,090
我住在...
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yeah, I stayed at the, um,

615
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:21,010
东俄亥俄州的手绘酒店
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Freehand Hotel, East Ohio.

616
00:45:21,020 --> 00:45:23,410
然后今天早晨开回来的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And drove back this morning.

617
00:45:24,870 --> 00:45:26,100
挡风玻璃怎么回事
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}The windshield?

618
00:45:30,090 --> 00:45:32,630
我在36号公路撞了一只鹿
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I hit a deer on Route 36.

619
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:37,040
在斯蒂文斯波恩特的一家维修厂修了玻璃
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}The mechanic shop in Stevens Point fixed it.

620
00:45:37,220 --> 00:45:39,960
好了  迈克  我需要你
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Okay, Mike. I am gonna need you

621
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:43,820
把你准确的行车路线写下来
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}to write down the exact route that you took

622
00:45:43,820 --> 00:45:47,470
我们要核查高速监控录像
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}so we can confirm that with highway surveillance cameras.

623
00:45:54,230 --> 00:45:54,820
还需要
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Also gonna

624
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:58,290
扣留车辆做一下鲁米诺试验
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}need to hang on to the vehicle for a Luminol test.

625
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:03,760
好的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Sure.

626
00:46:24,010 --> 00:46:25,000
不能用个鬼
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Fuck it.

627
00:47:38,060 --> 00:47:40,330
迈克  等等
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hey, Mike. Wait, is...

628
00:47:41,110 --> 00:47:43,970
这是给不允许你用的壁炉烧的吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Is that for the fireplace you're not allowed to use?

629
00:47:44,510 --> 00:47:45,840
这样吧  干脆崩了我算了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You know what? Just shoot me.

630
00:47:46,170 --> 00:47:47,370
行吗  这次来真的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Okay? For real this time.

631
00:47:47,370 --> 00:47:48,550
因为这样比冻死
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Because it's a lot quicker way to go

632
00:47:48,550 --> 00:47:50,340
痛快得多
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}than just freezing to death.

633
00:47:52,890 --> 00:47:56,310
也许我们两个一开始就有些误会
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I think maybe you and I got off on the wrong foot.

634
00:47:58,110 --> 00:47:59,660
我跟柴德聊过了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I spoke to Chad.

635
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:01,610
他说你的事都核实无误
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}He said your story checks out.

636
00:48:01,750 --> 00:48:04,260
芝加哥  挡风玻璃
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Chicago, the windshield.

637
00:48:05,190 --> 00:48:06,270
对不起
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm sorry.

638
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:09,170
有艾莉森的消息吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Anything on Alison?

639
00:48:13,060 --> 00:48:14,860
跟她的几个朋友谈了谈
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Talked to some of her friends.

640
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:17,680
谁也不知道她有什么要离开镇子的缘由
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No one knows any reason why she might have left town

641
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:19,230
也不知道她可能去哪里
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}or where she could've gone.

642
00:48:19,660 --> 00:48:20,960
她家人正四处张贴传单
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}The family's putting up fliers

643
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:23,900
请求志愿者帮助搜寻
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and asking for volunteers to help in a search.

644
00:48:26,340 --> 00:48:27,560
需要帮忙就叫我
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Let me know if I can help.

645
00:48:30,150 --> 00:48:31,140
迈克
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Look, Mike...

646
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:36,140
我用猎枪招呼你的事
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}The thing with the shotgun.

647
00:48:38,030 --> 00:48:39,300
确实不太好
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}That wasn't cool.

648
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:44,160
对  是不好
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No. It wasn't.

649
00:49:03,730 --> 00:49:07,180
我之前把暖气的开关关上了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I had the breaker for the furnace turned off.

650
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:11,170
这没人住  干嘛给空房间供暖
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No one was living here. Why heat an empty place?

651
00:49:15,650 --> 00:49:17,860
差点忘了给你这个
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Oh, uh, almost forgot to give you this.

652
00:49:18,250 --> 00:49:20,310
我没让修车厂的人扔掉
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I got the guys at the body shop to save it.

653
00:49:20,370 --> 00:49:22,250
估计你儿子回来的时候可能想要
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Figured your son might want it when he got back.

654
00:49:24,870 --> 00:49:27,040
他在哪上学  你没说过
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Where's he at school? You didn't say.

655
00:49:27,910 --> 00:49:28,760
佛罗里达州
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Florida.

00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:30,500
不错  学什么专业的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Nice. What's he studying?

657
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:33,440

{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Uh, if your heat goes out,
