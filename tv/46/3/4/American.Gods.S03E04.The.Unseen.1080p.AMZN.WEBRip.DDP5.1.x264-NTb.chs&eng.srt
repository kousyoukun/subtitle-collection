美国众神 前情提要

2
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,400
我们是「血亡」
We are Blood Death

3
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:16,610
本曲献给全能的父
and this is dedicated to the All-Father.

4
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:19,620
复活神灵可不是你想得那么简单
Resurrecting a god isn't as easy as you'd think.

5
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:20,680
这个行吗
What about this?

6
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,860
萨梅迪给我的符咒
The gris-gris Samedi gave me.

7
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:24,620
对他有用吗
Would this work on him?

8
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,110
混合了爱情的血液
Blood... infused with love.

9
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:32,340
两滴
Two drops.

10
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:35,670
我现在意识到的现实就是
The reality that I am acknowledging

11
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:38,380
这个地方他妈烂透了
is that this place sucks donkey dick.

12
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,830
崔克斯法官指定我作为威尔斯小姐的监督人
Judge Trakes appointed me Miss Wells' conservator.

13
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:43,030
你好  亲爱的
Hello, darling.

14
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:45,770
你妻子的行为能力也许有所下降
Your wife's capacity may be diminished,

15
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:48,140
但是她的投资产品很稳健
but her portfolio is robust.

16
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,350
转移  误导
Distract. Misdirect.

17
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:53,870
让他们关注我们说什么是最重要的
Make them give a fuck about what we say is important.

18
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:03,670
快来找我  影・穆恩
Come find me, Shadow Moon.

19
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:27,590
国父们信奉一位造物主
The Founders believed in a creator

20
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:32,590
他赋予了每个人平等和自由
who endowed every individual with equality and freedom.

21
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:35,540
美国对这一点深信不疑
America was conceived around that truth

22
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:39,260
而「独立宣言」就是对这位造物主的誓言
and the Declaration was an oath to that creator.

23
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:43,440
庄严承诺这个新政府
A solemn promise that this new government

24
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:47,370
会维护其公民的神圣权利

25
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:51,120
包括生命  自由  以及追求幸福的权利
Life, liberty, and a shot at happiness.

26
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:55,740
但这个新政府负债累累
But the new government was overrun with debt.

27
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:00,210
激烈的辩论弄得大陆会议乌烟瘴气
Furious debate roiled the Continental Congress:

28
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:00,210
大陆会议是北美十三州
及后来美利坚合众国的立法机构和临时政府

29
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:04,460
天赋人权对战唯物主义
God-given rights versus materialism.

30
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:08,330
最终商业大获全胜
Commerce carried the day

31
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:14,470
这个年轻的国家逐渐成为了史上最富有的公司
and the young country was on its way to becoming the richest corporation in history.

32
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:20,210
在此过程中
In the process,

33
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:24,250
美国背叛了其对造物主的誓言
America betrayed its oath to the creator.

34
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:29,120
鞭子挥舞之下  经济飞速增长
Economic growth was spurred by the whip

35
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:33,650
财富留在了奴隶主及其投资者手中
and remained in the hands of the slave masters and their investors.

36
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:38,750
由棉花之王带来的财富遍布全国
The wealth generated by King Cotton was everywhere.

37
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:44,630
这个国家如今在商业的祭坛上祈祷
The nation now prayed at the altar of commerce.

38
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:48,610
但神灵并没有抛弃那些被奴役的人民
But the spirit did not abandon those who had been enslaved,

39
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:51,570
他们带着非洲的神  奥里莎
who brought their African gods, the Orishas,

40
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:53,490
一起来到了新世界
with them to the New World.

41
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:06,290
?涉水而来?
? Wade in the water ?

42
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:07,300
BGM: Wade In The Water by American Gods Cast

43
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:12,830
?涉水而来  孩子们?

44

49
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:41,000
来自故土的奥里莎啊  我呼唤您
I call upon the Orishas, of the land of the ancestors.

50
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:43,430
告诉大家我们不是一个人
Show the people that I is not me!

51
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:48,200
?涉水而来  孩子们?
? Wade in the water, children ?

52
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:45,210
我们是个整体
I is we!

53
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:53,810
?涉水而来?
? Wade in the water ?

54
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,950
团结就是力量
And we is power.

55
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:59,760
?神将会带来水患?
? God's gonna trouble the water ?

56
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,150
神将会带来水患
God's gonna trouble the water

57
00:03:58,150 --> 00:03:59,660
你是我的爱女
You are my beloved.

我是欧桑

60
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:14,150
我是叶玛亚  是水
I am Yemoja, the water.

61
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:17,590
负担过重  难以为继之时
When the burden is too great,

62
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,540
来我怀里休息吧
you rest in my arms.

63
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,020
我是阿耶
I am Aye,

64
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,020
是你们脚下的土
the earth beneath you.

65
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:31,020
你们在我身上流血  我的心也为你们滴血
You bleed upon me and I bleed upon you.

66
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,430
终有一天
The time will come

67
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:36,780
我们将会作为一个整体崛起
when we rise together as one.

68
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:39,090
正义永不休眠
Justice does not sleep.

69
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:43,020
正义来自神灵的手中
Righteousness comes from the hand of the divine.

70
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:45,920
奴隶主的权力减少
The power of the master diminishes.

71
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:48,850
我们中被奴役的人们
Those of us who have been enslaved

72
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:52,420
是尘埃中升起的一股力量

愿你们对明日的美好向往成为今日生活的支柱
May the optimism of tomorrow be your foundation for today

74
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:59,370
我们是一个整体  团结就是力量
and I is we, and we is power,

75
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:00,240
如果我们各自为营
and we are powerless

76
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,500
将会无权无力  一无所有
if we just become nothing but you and they.

77
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,890
愿你们内心宁静
May peace be in your hearts

78
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,970
愿奥里莎引领你们前行

你把她怎么了
What'd you do to her?

85
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:19,440
我说  你他妈到底对她做了什么
I said, what the fuck did you do to her?

86
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,830
什么都没做
Nothing.

87
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:24,010
我来这里是因为那个贱人对我干的事
I am here because of what that bitch did to me!

88
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:33,240

你他妈什么毛病
What the hell is wrong with you?

91
00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:01,630
我告诉过你了  比奇丝把我搞惨了
I told you: Bilquis fucked me up.

92
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:07,590
我需要她这个系铃人把铃铛解开
I need her to unfuck whatever it is that she did to me.

93
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:10,640

住手  快住手

我觉得我貌似搞清楚这里发生什么了
I think I might have figured out what went down here.

96
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,830
那你说吧  赶紧

比奇丝在这里勾搭的最后一个人

98
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:23,690
是...比尔・桑德斯

99
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:26,080
就是那位比尔・桑德斯
The Bill Sanders.

100
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:30,490
如果你想撒谎的话
If you are going to lie,

101
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,870
起码得撒得可信些
make it believable.

102
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:34,160
我说的是真话

偷偷来这里见比奇丝

但妹子有办法把人...弄不见

110
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:01,220

他的手机还在这里

这依旧没有解释比奇丝去哪了

00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:17,420
我已经道过歉了

142
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:18,960
不接受
Apology not accepted.

143
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,560
永远不会
Not now. Not ever.

144
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:24,140
我不是一个人
I am not alone.

145
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:26,980
我选择坚信
I choose to believe that.

146
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:29,440
我必须坚信
I have to believe that.

147
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,920
我不是一个人
I am not alone.

148
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:46,150
我不是一个人
I am not alone.

149
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:49,550
我选择坚信
I choose to believe that.

150
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:51,790
我必须坚信
I have to believe that.

151
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,020
我不是一个人
I am not alone.

152
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:55,840
桑德斯是个熟客
Sanders was a regular.

153
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,190
差不多一年了  每周都会去见她一次
Been seeing her once a week for over a year now.

154
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:00,600
问题是她在为谁工作
The question is, who's she working for?

155
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,830
你的高祖母
Your great-great-grandmother?

156
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:07,050
对  她当时可算个人物
Oh yeah, she was a personage.

157
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:10,990
她是路易斯安那州首位黑人女性律师
She was the first black woman lawyer in Louisiana.

158
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:13,590
这还有不少你不知道的事
There's lots to learn here.

159
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,550
戴蒙  你在跑哪
Hey, Damon. Where you at?

160
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:16,580
戴蒙
Damon?

161
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:19,260
再不过来我就要揍你了
Come on over here before I kick your poo butt.

162
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,010
爸爸

163
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,240
爸爸

164
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:30,940
爸爸  爸爸

00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:45,330
欢迎各位

166
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:47,420
炼狱  新人指南

167
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:49,570
认清现实

168
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:55,190
你带没带烟啊
Pst. I don't suppose you've got a smoke on you, do ya?

169
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:56,600
我倒希望我带了
Oh, I wish.

170
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:58,590
我可是一天抽三包的人
Three-pack-a-day girl over here.

171
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:01,210
等我得了喉癌  医生又叫我
When I got throat cancer, my doctor said I had

172
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:03,810
改变生活习惯
to change my lifestyle.

173
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:05,290
我就改吸了薄荷脑
So I switched to menthol.

174
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:06,530
那挺好啊
Hm! Nice.

175
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:12,630
等我们经历所有磨难之后
Um, so, once we've jumped through all of the hoops,

176
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:15,200
你知道具体什么时候才能离开这吗
do you know when the fuck we finally get outta here?

177
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,900
这是死亡的谜团之一
One of death's great mysteries.

178
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:20,000
我要是你  我可不会
I wouldn't spend a whole lotta time

179
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:21,920
为了搞清这个花那么多时间
trying to figure it out if I were you.

180
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:24,800
不然你就会变得跟那个蠢蛋一样
Or you'll end up like that sorry son-of-a-bitch.

181
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:26,760
这个人
This guy?

182
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,760
我是1993年夏天去世的
I died summer of '93.

183
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:31,440
那会他就这熊样
He was like that then.

184
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:33,820
从那之后就没变过
Nothing's changed since.

185
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:35,630
这么奇葩
Yikes.

186
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,920
持有红卡的旅客请注意

请前往指定区域
please make your way to the designated area...

188
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:44,810
没门
No.

189
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:46,640
仅限红卡持有者
Red card holders only.

190
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:56,460
你有没有见过
You haven't by any chance seen a guy in here:

191
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,520
大高个  红头发  咋咋呼呼
super tall, red hair, big mouth,

192
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,360
态度嚣张  像是爱尔兰人的一个人
bad attitude, Irish-ish?

193
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,850
没见过
I don't believe so.

194
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:04,400
但我对人不大留意
But I'm not much of a people watcher.

195
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:06,920
如果你见过他  绝对忘不了的
Oh, you would remember this guy if you saw him, trust me.

196
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,290
他就算在人群里也很显眼
He's pretty hard to miss.

197
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,970
所以你就喜欢那种坏男人  是吧
So, you're into the bad boys, are you?

198
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:12,900
才不是
Oh no, ew.

199
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:15,310
不是那么一回事
No, that's not what it was like at all.

200
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:16,460
不是
Oh, no.

201
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:18,270
以你刚才的描述
You were just talking like...

202
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,260
他听着像特别的人
...maybe he's someone special.

203
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:25,950
? Worlds end ?

204
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,710
? Stars dimmed ?

205
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:37,600
? Dark falls ?

206
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:42,410
? But your magic ?

207
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:45,110
? Still remains ?

208
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:47,750
? I'm here ?

209
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:50,790
? You're gone ?

210
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:52,890
? Hearts break ?

211
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:52,890
不行  绝对不行
No, no, no!

212
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:56,670
? Will your magic see me ?

213
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:59,190
? Can I ?

214
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:01,850
? Go on ?

215
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:06,520
? Without you ?

216
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:09,940
其实  他是杀我的凶手
Actually, he... is the guy who killed me.

217
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:13,250
对
Yup.

218
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,360
请注意
Attention.

219
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:17,570
持有红卡的旅客
Those with red cards, please make your way

220
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:20,220
现在请前往指定区域
to the designated area at this time.

221
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:25,120
这个傻逼哈钦森自以为能忽悠我
This Hutchinson pinhead thinks he can get one over on me.

222
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:27,670
我忘掉的骗术
Ha. I've forgotten more about long cons

223
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:28,650
都比他知道的多
than he'll ever know.

224
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:30,250
已经黑进他的企业账户了
Hacked into his business accounts.

225
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:33,020
保护者个屁
Conservator, my ass.

226
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:34,270
他就是个吸血鬼
He's a vampire.

227
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:36,160
专吸老弱病残
Preying on the elderly and infirm.

228
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,290
就别提抹黑厄琉西斯密仪了
Never mind defaming the Eleusinian mysteries.

229
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:40,120
好
Okay.

230
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:42,550
恰好在开曼群岛
Hello, Cayman Islands.

231
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:43,280
找对了
Bingo.

232
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,550
这老哥可谓轻车熟路
Man, this guy's got it all figured out.

233
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:46,990
离岸账户
Offshore accounts,

234
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,460
把从客户信托那里敛来的财
money being siphoned from the client trusts into...

235
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:53,360
看不到转移到哪去了  有防火墙
Firewall won't let me see where.

236
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:55,270
如果你想要那种
If you want proof of the

237
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:57,580
能掐住他要害的证据
stringing-him-up-by-the-balls variety,

238
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:00,040
我必须得接触到他的电脑
I'm gonna need access to his computer,

239
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:02,320
他的硬盘
like the actual hard drive.

240
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:05,370
蠢货里他算狡猾的了
A crafty pinhead, he is.

241
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:06,700
好
Fine.

242
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:10,740
那就进他家里的办公室拿吧
A home office B-and-E it is then.

243
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:14,360
说不定还能来一出父子戏
Perhaps a father and son two-hander.

244
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:16,300
好戏开始
Game on.

245
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:18,080
服务员呢
Now, where's that waitress?

246
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,840
我他妈要饿死了
I am fucking starving!

247
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,070
好
All right.

248
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:24,560
女儿的司机在那
There's the daughter's driver.

249
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,780
后面还有一辆车
And the follow car.

250
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,770
看见没
See?

251
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:30,140
带我来是不是有好处
Aren't you glad you brought me along?

252
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:54,310
没事  兄弟
It's alright, buddy.

253
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,130
绕个路吧
Little detour.

254
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:13,230
吉尔伯特  这事算是了结了
Well, Gilbert, the excitement appears to be concluded

255
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:14,990
这倒霉蛋的尸骨
and this poor man's remains

256
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:16,760
也要火化了
are about to be given to the furnace,

257
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:21,010
把这好好清理干净吧
so let's clean it up real good in here.

258
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:23,080
可怜的家伙
Poor fella.

259
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:27,030
任何人都不该这样离世
That is no way for a soul to be leaving this world.

260
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:28,680
再怎么也是神的子民
Someone oughta be holding a high thought

261
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,350
下手也该讲个轻重
for that child of God.

262
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:32,440
好好清理吧
Knock yourself out, Gilbert.

263
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,080
真行
Great. Great!

264
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:47,440
这简直就一块砖
A brick!

265
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:49,610
还没信号
And no bars.

266
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:52,100
你要找的东西肯定不在那里面
Whatever you're looking for, you won't find it in that.

267
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:56,160
我们就用那种低端非智能手机
We like our phones empty and dumb.

268
00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:57,910
就像你俩一样蠢
Like you two idiots.

269
00:18:57,910 --> 00:18:59,020
她在哪
Where is she?

270
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:05,570
一次性手机
Burner phones.

271
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:08,170
用完就能扔
Disposable.

272
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,750
无法追踪
Untraceable.

273
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:11,990
我知道你不喜欢无线通讯
I know wireless isn't your jam,

274
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:14,750
但这样不会让我们被监测到
but... it'll keep us under the radar.

275
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:18,730
我们将彻底销声匿迹  连国安局的那帮混蛋
We'll be so off the grid not even the assholes at the NSA

276
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:20,200
都无法追踪到我们
will be able to track us,

277
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,830
他们能追踪所有人
and they track everybody, just 'cause.

278
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,790
我觉得电话号码
I don't think phone numbers

279
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:30,530
没有那么多位
actually have that many digits.

280
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:33,080
准确来说是21位
21, to be exact.

281
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:35,670
在北欧神话体系下三是个很重要的数字
Three is a very important number in Norse mythology,

282
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:37,510
象征着王室
signifying royalty.

283
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:41,410
七也同等重要  象征着完整
Seven is of equal stature, representing completeness.

284
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:42,770
你算算吧
Do the math.

285
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:45,070
三乘以七是
Three times seven is...

286
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:47,830
知道了
Got it.

287
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:04,930
你好
Hello?

288
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:10,020
是找你的
It's for you.

289
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,760
那是条保密线路
That's a secure line.

290
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:14,750
很显然并不是  蠢货
Well, apparently not, dickhead.

291
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:17,930
现在把嘴闭上
Now, shut the fuck up.

292
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:19,900
你好
Hello?

293
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:21,030
影子
Shadow?

294
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:22,150
是我
Yeah.

295
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:25,630
你爸想和你聊聊
Your father would like a word.

296
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,120
你好  我的孩子
Hello, my boy.

297
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:35,280
我现在挺忙的
Okay, I am kind of in the middle of something.

298
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,430
我在马萨诸塞州有活给你干
I need you for a job up here in Massachusetts.

299
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:40,400
开车差不多三小时就到
Should take about three hours to drive up?

300
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,480
不可能的
Not happening.

301
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:42,940
好吧
Okay...

302
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,330
等我找到比奇丝后再聊
we'll talk after I find Bilquis.

303
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:48,070
他不来吗
No luck?

304
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,180
看来我们得找别的方法
Looks like we'll have to find

305
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:52,800
来营救我的新娘了
another way to rescue my bride.

306
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:59,110
我们之间没有必要变得这么对立
There's no reason for this to turn adversarial.

307
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:01,540
把关押她的地点给我们
So, just give us the location of where she's being held,

308
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:03,340
你就能回去干自己的活了
you get to go about your business.

309
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:05,960
你们是谁
Who are you guys?

310
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:08,180
条件是这样的  蠢货
Okay, here is the deal, shithead.

311
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:12,810
你要把我们想知道的告诉我们
You are going to tell us what we need to know,

312
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:16,670
不然我们会用煤油
or we are going to peel your fucking skin off

313
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:19,410
将你的皮肤剥下来  懂了吗
with fucking kerosene. You dig?

314
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:23,210
煤油
Kerosene?

315
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:25,500
认真的吗
Seriously?

316
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:29,300
拜托你别这么紧绷  稍微松松劲儿
I'm gonna need you to dial it back to about a two.

317
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,690
我来吧
I'll handle this.

318
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:35,810
你真的不知道你在和谁打交道
You really have no idea who you're dealing with.

319
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:37,730
你听说过外星人计划吗  没有吗
You ever hear of the alien agenda? No?

320
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:41,320
这远远超出你的水平
'Cause you are so far out of your league,

321
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,100
你根本不知道你面对的是什么情况
you don't even know what game you're playing.

322
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:49,070
你得快点开口
You need to start talkin'

323
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:52,090
不然你就会看到一些让你终身难忘的东西
or you're gonna start to see some shit that you really can't unsee.

324
00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:53,610
从他脑袋里喷出来的东西是什么
What's that stuff spraying out of his head?

325
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:54,840
你知道吗
You know what?

326
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:56,470
给他点厉害尝尝
Give him a taste.

327
00:22:09,650 --> 00:22:11,380
做过肠镜吗  马克
Ever been probed, Mark?

328
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:15,070
被短灰人  高白人抓起来
You know, grabbed up by the Greys, Tall Whites,

329
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:17,030
你什么都不会记得
you never remember a thing, but...

330
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:19,670
但是他那种外星人
...his kind.

331
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,800
不管你多么想忘记
Yeah, that shit you never forget...

332
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:29,150
那种事你是无法忘记的
...no matter how hard you try.

333
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:33,500
我们先从繁殖系统开始
We'll be starting with the reproductive system.

334
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,110
不不不  等等等等
No, no, no! Wait, wait, wait, wait!

335
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:36,460
她在霍博肯
She's in Hoboken!

336
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:38,270
她被关在
She's being held, um...

337
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:41,940
木材供应厂
...in a building behind the, uh,

338
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:43,560
后面的那栋楼里
behind the lumber supply!

339
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:49,390
我们走吧
Let's go.

340
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:56,150
「碎片大厦」的进度已经远远落后于初定内容了
We're behind schedule on the initial components for SHARD.

341
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:57,560
-为什么  -这不是我们的错
- Why? - It's not our fault.

342
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:00,120
我们应经准备好对基线算法进行内部测试了
We're ready to alpha test baseline algorithms.

343
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:02,270
这就是你遮羞的方式吗
Is that the sound of you covering your anus?

344
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:05,560
我们的软件供应商里维那边有个问题
There's a problem with our software suppliers, Levitech.

345
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,320
什么样的问题
What kind of problem?

346
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,300
董事会里一片混乱
Total chaos in the boardroom.

347
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:10,900
他们在尽一切努力不让事情曝光
They're doing their best to keep it under wraps,

348
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:14,970
但我们做了些研究发现威廉・桑德斯失踪了
but we did some digging and William Sanders is MIA.

349
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:17,440
投资者得到了风声  道琼斯指数一路下跌
Investors catch wind, the Dow craters.

350
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:20,400
地球上最厉害的人之一
How exactly does one of the most

351
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,520
是怎么失踪的
powerful men on the planet go missing?

352
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,700
很显然是从一个曼哈顿的应召女郎家里失踪的
In a Manhattan call-girl's apartment, apparently.

353
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,900
至于是怎么失踪的  我不太想推测
As to how, I wouldn't want to speculate.

354
00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:33,490
-至于偶发事件  -给我滚出去
- As far as contingency-- - Get the fuck out.

355
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:34,480
好的
Okay.

356
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:44,340
展示新泽西州  霍博肯的
Show me Levitech Server Farm Number 37.

357
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:46,100
里维第37号服务器集群
Hoboken, New Jersey.

358
00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:50,260
这他妈的
Oh, for fuck's sake.

359
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:54,730
镜头5

360
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:54,520
我早该料到的
I should've known.

361
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,820
他妈的疯婊子
Crazy fucking bitch.

362
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,920
有人很帅
Somebody's handsome.

363
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:07,910
安息吧
Peaceful rest.

364
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:30,730
亲爱的孩子
Dear child...

365
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:33,900
你可以哼得小声点么
could you please hum more quietly?

366
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:35,780
你知道这首歌是什么吗  旋律是
Do you, do you know what song this is? It's like...

367
00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:43,570
有人知道吗  有人知道这首是什么歌吗
Anybody? Does anybody know what this song is?

368
00:25:43,570 --> 00:25:44,960
求求你们了  旋律是
Please? It's like:

369
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:50,010
请告诉我这是什么歌
Somebody please tell me what this fucking song is.

370
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:53,000
这是施维格的「巴尔德的镇魂歌」
It's Schwieger's Requiem of Balder.

371
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:55,060
-你在这干什么  -喝咖啡
- What are you doing here? - Coffee.

372
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:57,100
后面都没人能煮新的一壶
No one in the back ever makes a fresh pot.

373
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:58,220
你能告诉我这首歌是什么吗
Can you please tell me what this song is

374
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:00,010
我小时候看的某部电影
that was playing in the background all the time

375
00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:01,630
它背景音乐一直是这首
when I was a kid in the movie thing?

376
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:02,510
这一定代表了什么
It must mean something.

377
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,210
-像是什么  -我也不知道
- Like what? - I don't know.

378
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:06,520
-你是那个炼狱人  -向导
- You're the Purgatory guy. - Guide.

379
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:09,430
-我是炼狱向导  -好的
- I'm the Purgatory guide. - Okay, good.

380
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,090
你要不是个万事通的话  也许
If you weren't such a know-it-all, and maybe

381
00:26:12,090 --> 00:26:13,790
你应该多待一会
you'd hung around a little while longer,

382
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:16,000
也许能了解更多
you might've found out more.

383
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:19,960
-例如什么  -你拥有强大的命运
- Like what? - You have a powerful destiny.

384
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:22,450
那他妈是什么意思
Whatever the fuck that means.

385
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:25,150
那是说你会吸引强大的敌人
It means you attract powerful enemies.

386
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:27,460
是啊  我被一个战神杀死了
Well, yeah. I mean, I was killed by a war god.

387
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:28,660
那个敌人是挺强大的
It's a pretty fucking powerful enemy.

388
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,370
-好吧  -好吧
- Okay. - Okay, well,

389
00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:32,630
那和这首歌有什么关系
what does it have to do with the song?

390
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,110
我也不知道
I have no idea.

391
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,720
这是像
Well, is it like, uh,

392
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:37,380
他的主题曲什么的吗
his theme song or something?

393
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:39,760
像是首战神斗曲吗
Like a war god fight song?

394
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:48,470
还有人看见了吗
Did anybody else see that?

395
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:14,320
嗨
Hi.

396
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:22,110
嗨
Hi.

397
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:26,420
刚刚管子上
There was a kink in the...

398
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:28,590
打了个结  然后
...hose. And then...

399
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:32,640
你是从哪  你是从哪里来的
Where did you... Where did you come from?

400
00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:35,990
炼狱
Um, Purgatory?

401
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,350
-你一定冷了  -是啊
- You must be cold. - Yeah.

402
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,010
是啊
Yeah.

403
00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:54,310
操
Shit.

404
00:27:55,330 --> 00:27:56,750
我活过来了
I'm alive.

405
00:27:57,150 --> 00:27:59,100
是的女士  我想你是活过来了
Yes, ma'am. I believe you are.

406
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:06,110
-这是我的血吗  -不是
- Is this mine? - No.

407
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:08,460
也有可能
Or maybe.

408
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,030
我不太清楚
I can't really tell.

409
00:28:11,650 --> 00:28:14,030
我想可能是之前的尸体上的
I... think it's from the body that was here.

410
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:18,300
高个子  红头发吗
Oh. Tall guy? Red hair?

411
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:21,000
-是的  -那是斯维尼
- Yeah. - Oh, that's Sweeney.

412
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,340
你知道他去哪里了吗
Um, do you happen to know where he went?

413
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:26,560
他被运走了  就不久前
Took him away. Little while ago.

414
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:28,520
至少是剩下的部分
What was left of him anyway.

415
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,050
他们要火化遗体
They're cremating the remains.

416
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:33,050
好吧  那么他确实死了
Okay, so he's dead.

417
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:36,490
是真的死了  完全死掉了
Like, actually dead. Completely dead.

418
00:28:39,810 --> 00:28:41,100
而这都是我的错
And it's my fault.

419
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:48,470
不不不
No, no, no.

420
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:50,980
我没杀他  就只是...
I didn't kill him. Heh. Just, um...

421
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,170
没法救活他
Just couldn't bring him back to life,

422
00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:56,770
本来我是可以做到的
which I should've been able to do.

423
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:58,900
但我没有
But I didn't.

424
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,250
说来话长了
It's a long story.

425
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:04,730
是我就不会这么责怪自己
Well, I wouldn't be too hard on yourself.

426
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:08,280
就像那本书中说的 世间万物有生
Like the book says, there's a time to be born

427
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:10,620
就有死
and there's a time to die.

428
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:12,970
是  但是不能因为有人在书里这么写了
Right. But just because somebody wrote it in a book

429
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:15,280
-就把它当做真理  -是没错
- doesn't mean it's true. - Fair enough.

430
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:16,500
我想我只是那种
I guess I'm just someone

431
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:19,140
相信不管他身处何方
who's inclined to believe that wherever he is,

432
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:21,880
那都是他的命运所在
that's where he's supposed to be.

433
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:40,300
BGM: Don't Stand Still by Harmony on Mars

434
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:44,950
? Do you think you're above everyone ?

435
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:47,210
? you know yourself well ?

436
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:55,090
看着点  你个蠢货
Watch it, you fucking moron.

437
00:29:55,450 --> 00:29:57,180
-说我是个蠢货  -没错  你就是
- I'm a fucking moron? - Fuck yeah, you are.

438
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:03,930
这是种不打算让居民受惊吓的
This is a home invasion with no specific intention

439
00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:06,200
家园入侵
of terrorizing the inhabitants,

440
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,810
虽然我不介意让那些无生气的
although I wouldn't mind if the bloodless milksop

441
00:30:08,810 --> 00:30:11,410
胆小鬼丈夫干点脏活
of a husband gets dirtied up a little, huh?

442
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:14,640
他需要看到他的世界崩溃
He just needs to see his world crumble

443
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,980
而我只需要他的电脑
and I just... need his computer.

444
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,500
-你有什么毛病  -有这个
- What the fuck is wrong with you? - This.

445
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,210
你听着呢吗
You listening?

446
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:28,250
有
Yeah.

447
00:30:28,610 --> 00:30:30,480
没问题  24小时内交给你
Yeah. You got it. You'll have it in 24 hours.

448
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,000
-很好  -但是兄弟  我需要你帮个忙
- Good. - But brother, I need a favor.

449
00:30:32,010 --> 00:30:33,350
说吧
Well, say it.

450
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:35,850
那个狗屎约翰每次一出现
Every time that shit-stain Johan comes in here,

451
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:37,350
就会惹出麻烦
he causes a problem.

452
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:40,060
我想让那蠢货
I want that fucking ape

453
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:41,580
从这里滚出去  不然就让他见血
out of here or he bleeds.

454
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:43,000
我来处理
I'll handle it.

455
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:54,890
他什么来头
So, what's his story?

456
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:56,500
传奇
Legend.

457
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:59,420
他在1978年骑着一辆哈雷61扁头摩托
He rode a '61 Flathead up Whiteface Mountain

458
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:01,030
顶着暴风雪上怀特费斯山
in the blizzard of '78.

459
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:03,560
每小时160公里的风速  一米厚的冰雪
100-mile-an-hour winds, sheet ice three feet thick.

460
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:06,210
来啊  上啊  上啊
Come on, bring it! Bring it! Bring it!

461
00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:08,040
后来无人可以企及
No one else since has even come close.

462
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:10,740
在面试乐队新成员吗  约翰
Auditioning new bandmates, Johan?

463
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:12,340
他们说那是不可能做到的事
They say it ain't possible.

464
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:14,870
在星期三身上  规则如同虚无
With Wednesday, rules just don't apply.

465
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:16,660
先生们  别这样
Gentlemen! Come on, come on!

466
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:19,970
这一切都是一场大误会  对不对  约翰
This is all a... a big misunderstanding, isn't it, Johan?

467
00:31:19,970 --> 00:31:21,660
你不想伤到任何人  对吧
You didn't mean any harm, did you?

468
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:24,580
不  没有  他不是有意的
No. No, he means no harm.

469
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:26,410
无论如何  据我所知
Anyway, as far as I know,

470
00:31:26,410 --> 00:31:28,630
不是有老话说  真正的派对
isn't it true that the party doesn't start

471
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:31,140
在没见点血之前就不算开始  是吧
unless a little blood has been spilled, huh?

472
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:34,800
这样好多了  来吧
That's better. Come on.

473
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:37,360
来吧  约翰
Come on, Johan!

474
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:39,840
老板  给所有人来一杯
Innkeeper, drinks all around, huh?

475
00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:46,460
别把帮手干掉了好吗  孩子
Try not to kill the help, my boy. Huh?

476
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:49,460
他们的吹捧在支撑我们
Their adulation sustains us.

477
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:57,300
我有时候会忘记规则  好吗
I sometimes forget the rules, okay?

478
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:00,430
我明白
I understand.

479
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:03,270
你依然在为乐队成员的去世悲伤
You're still grieving your bandmates.

480
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:06,350
他们是我的兄弟  我的家人
They were my... brothers, my family.

481
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,880
我会找出是谁杀了他们
And I will find whoever fucking killed them,

482
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,480
我要活剥了他们的皮
and I will skin them alive.

483
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:15,490
是你杀了他们吗
Did you kill them?

484
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:18,850
没有  你为什么这么问我  我没有
No, I... Why would you ask me that? No!

485
00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:21,670
我温和  可爱
Oh, my gentle, sweet,

486
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:25,020
嗜血的火熊
blood-drinking fire-bear.

487
00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:27,470
事实是这样的
The facts are these:

488
00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:29,950
你经常会发狂
you frequently do go ape-shit,

489
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:31,820
在那种境界下
and in such states,

490
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:34,550
你不会记得自己做了什么错事
do not remember what fell deeds you do.

491
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:37,640
那可能是场意外
It could've been an accident.

492
00:32:37,870 --> 00:32:39,990
可能是任何人杀了那个乐队
Anyone could kill that band.

493
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:42,690
很多人都想过
Many want to.

494
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:44,170
但是要记住
But, remember, huh?

495
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:46,310
我们需要
We need...

496
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:49,920
你的音乐能够召集的所有门徒
all the disciples that your music can gather.

497
00:32:49,930 --> 00:32:53,350
所以你需要组成一个新的乐队
So, you must form a new band.

498
00:32:56,150 --> 00:32:58,580
我没有杀他们
I did not kill them!

499
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,580
听我说
Listen to me.

500
00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:08,890
给我回家去
Go the fuck home.

501
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,860
好好睡一觉
Sleep it off.

502
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:14,030
然后  照我说的去做
And then, do what I fucking tell you.

503
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,030
好吗
Okay?

504
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:18,460
是的  全能的父
Yes, All-Father.

505
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:30,360
我祈求我的神
I cry to my god,

506
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:32,740
但是他不在王座之上
but his throne is empty!

507
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:48,810
敬我们至高无上的神
To the god in whose name we stand tall!

508
00:33:48,810 --> 00:33:50,540
奥丁万岁
Hail Odin!

509
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,480
熟悉的面孔
Familiar faces.

510
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,870
我与
I have a close

511
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:24,530
里维有着紧密的战略合作
strategic partnership with Levitech,

512
00:34:24,930 --> 00:34:27,020
我同意
and I agreed

513
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:30,850
你可以从桑德斯先生那里
that you could accept worship

514
00:34:30,850 --> 00:34:32,510
获取崇拜
from Mr. Sanders

515
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:35,460
但前提是你不能去
with the provision that you did not

516
00:34:35,470 --> 00:34:39,900
献祭他
facilitate his sacrifice.

517
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:42,430
我与我门徒之间的事情
What transpires between my worshippers and I

518
00:34:42,430 --> 00:34:44,290
与你无关
is none of your concern.

519
00:34:47,610 --> 00:34:51,910
那让我们把这一页翻过去吧
Let's... turn a page on the past, then.

520
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:54,470
你和我
You and me.

521
00:34:54,750 --> 00:34:59,740
新神  与旧神
New God... to old Goddess.

522
00:35:07,370 --> 00:35:11,450
如果你全心全意侍奉新神
If you fully commit to the new gods,

523
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:14,460
你作为典型  将能够说服
your example will persuade

524
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:18,290
旧联盟中的很多人
many in the old alliance

525
00:35:18,290 --> 00:35:23,420
去反对逼近我们的战争
to reject this war looming over us all!

526
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:26,600
星期三不可能独自迎战
Wednesday can't go into battle by himself.

527
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:29,420
你总是这套话
It's always the same speech with you.

528
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:33,690
对不起
I'm sorry.

529
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:45,740
我们的技术将会  重新定义
Our technology will... revolutionize

530
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:48,960
人与神之间的关系
man's relationship with the divine.

531
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:53,110
新神与旧神将会与门徒的思想
New gods and old gods will have a direct interface

532
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:54,880
有着直接的交流
with the minds of our worshippers.

533
00:35:55,890 --> 00:35:57,450
我不相信你
I don't believe you.

534
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:03,370
你离不开这里
You're not getting out of here.

535
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:09,170
除非比尔・桑德斯奇迹般的出现
Unless Bill Sanders miraculously appears

536
00:36:09,170 --> 00:36:11,300
解决这场误会
and clears up this misunderstanding.

537
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:14,810
我们都知道这是不可能的
We both know that is not going to happen.

538
00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:20,600
我想要救你的命
I am trying to save your life.

539
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:25,090
我不是一个人
I'm not alone.

540
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:28,740
我有爱
I... I have love.

541
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:31,180
你这是走到尽头了
Haven't you come to the end?

542
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,530
我有爱  我有爱
I have love. I have love.

543
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,630
我希望不会太痛苦
I hope it's not too painful.

544
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:56,950
下一步吗
Next steps?

545
00:36:56,950 --> 00:37:00,910
如果她依然拒绝说出桑德斯的下落
If she still refuses to give up Sanders' whereabouts,

546
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:04,730
我们不能冒险让她成为别人的情报线人
we can't risk her becoming an intelligence asset to someone else.

547
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:22,640
扁鼠和疣猪关店了
Pressed Rat and Warthog have closed down their shop.

548
00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:30,250
他们虽然不愿意  但也只能这样了
They didn't want to, 'twas all they had got.

549
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:33,040
卖「无调苹果」
Selling atonal apples,

550
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:35,480
「放大热量」
amplified heat,

551
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:40,220
还有扁鼠杂七杂八的唱片
and Pressed Rat's collection of dog legs and feet.

552
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:48,970
别挡路  混蛋
Get out of the way, asshole!

553
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:52,940
恶心的脏老头
Disgusting dirty old man!

554
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:54,840
那话不错  混蛋
Nice cock, asshole!

555
00:39:06,170 --> 00:39:07,730
老爹来电话了
Daddy's calling.

556
00:39:06,170 --> 00:39:08,900
自助

557
00:39:22,130 --> 00:39:23,840
-喂  -影子  谢天谢地
- Hello? - Oh, Shadow, thank God.

558
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,890
等等  你没事吧
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Y-you all right?

559
00:39:25,890 --> 00:39:28,400
我没事  但是有个叫约翰的疯子
I'm fine, but some whack-job berserker named Johan

560
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,710
把飙车族酒吧给炸了  当时你爸就在里面
blew up the biker bar while your dad was inside.

561
00:39:31,810 --> 00:39:34,370
-他...  -很遗憾  他们走了...
- Is he... - Sadly, they left...

562
00:39:34,370 --> 00:39:36,550
-他没事  -...没跟任何人告别
- He's fine. - ...telling no one good-bye.

563
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:38,160
他有事  他身体没什么问题
He's not fine. He's okay physically,

564
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,590
但是脑子糊涂了
but his head is a mess.

565
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:42,210
疣猪一条条纹领带
...Warthog a striped tie.

566
00:39:42,210 --> 00:39:44,380
我们正在送他去医院
We're checking him into a hospital now.

567
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:47,650
一家特诊医院  精神病院
It's like a... a special hospital. A nuthouse.

568
00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:50,080
这可真是时候  是吧
It's about fucking time, though, really, right?

569
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:51,520
很严重
This is serious!

570
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,470
好吧  好吧
All right, all right, all right...

571
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:55,700
-你没事吧  -还行  不过...
- Are you okay? - More or less, but...

572
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:57,560
好  可是  听我说
Okay, well, listen, listen. I, um...

573
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,700
我这边有点情况  但是
I-I've got a situation on my hands here, but...

574
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:02,230
我知道你跟你爸之间有些不愉快
I know you and your dad have beef,

575
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:04,220
但我从没见过他这个样子
but I've never seen him like this.

576
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:06,050
你得来一趟
You need to come.

577
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,870
求你了
Please.

578
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,010
油箱满了
Tank's full.

579
00:40:15,410 --> 00:40:18,760
他现在安全了  对吧
Look, um, he's safe right now, yeah?

580
00:40:18,770 --> 00:40:21,410
算是吧  只要给他穿上约束衣之类的
Yeah, I guess, once they get him into a straitjacket or something.

581
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:24,370
尽你全力  确保他的安全
Do whatever you can. Make sure he's safe.

582
00:40:24,950 --> 00:40:26,670
-我们明天再聊  -我真的认为你应该...
- We'll talk tomorrow. - I really think you should...

583
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:29,950
自助
普通柴油

584
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:33,080
我得挂了  我会尽快联系你  拜拜
I-I gotta go. Okay? Uh, we'll talk as soon as I can. Bye.

585
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:41,350
有个猴子在我裤子里拉屎了
A monkey shat in my pants.

586
00:40:41,350 --> 00:40:43,260
都会好起来的
Everything's gonna be okay.

587
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:43,490
你精致
You are exquisite.

588
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:45,580
如珠宝
A jewel.

589
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:47,000
巧克力般的肌肤
Your chocolate skin.

590
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:49,610
-眼神迷离  -对
- Your hypnotic gaze. - Yes.

591
00:41:51,190 --> 00:41:52,670
继续说
Tell me more.

592
00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:53,760
神秘
Mysterious.

593
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,240
洋气
Exotic.

594
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:57,590
你诱惑我  吞噬我
You tempt me, you devour me.

595
00:41:57,590 --> 00:41:59,620
你邪恶的美
You wicked beauty.

596
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:03,250
我必须要你  进入你
I have to have you, to be inside you.

597
00:42:03,250 --> 00:42:05,730
-进入你  -崇拜我
- Be inside you. - Worship me!

598
00:42:05,730 --> 00:42:07,820
你为我而生  我的女神
You were made for me, my goddess.

599
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:09,770
你为我而生
You were made for me.

600
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:18,510
闭嘴
Be silent!

601
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:24,470
我不是你口中的那样
I am not what you say.

602
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:29,100
我不是为你而生  我生在希瓦之前
I was not made for you. I was before Shiva,

603
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:31,270
在阿佛洛狄特之前  在文字之前
I was before Aphrodite, before the word.

604
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,870
我不是一个人
I am not alone!

605
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:36,060
我知道  也被世人知晓
I knew and was known.

606
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:37,660
我是...
I was...

607
00:42:41,370 --> 00:42:42,970
我的名字...
My name was...

608
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:47,190
我的名字...
My name was...

609
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:11,100
你是谁
Who are you?

610
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:13,520
我了解你  就像你了解我一样
I know you as you know me.

611
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:20,400
我们是一个整体
I... is we.

612
00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:23,660
欧桑
Oshun.

613
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:30,750
看看你自己
Look at yourself.

614
00:43:32,470 --> 00:43:36,430
看你甜美真实的自己
See your sweet, true self.

615
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:39,430
看清你是谁的真相
See the truth in who you are.

616
00:43:41,130 --> 00:43:42,950
看清你一直以来的自己
And who you have always been.

617
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:46,570
我不是一个人
I am not alone.

618
00:43:46,570 --> 00:43:49,660
你是我的爱女
You are my beloved.

619
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:52,090
我会保佑你
I will uphold you in your courage

620
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:53,970
给你继续前行的勇气
as you carry life forward.

621
00:44:00,190 --> 00:44:02,590
他们所说的  不是真正的你
You are not who they say you are.

622
00:44:02,630 --> 00:44:04,980
你想成为谁  就成为谁
You are whoever you want to be.

623
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:08,030
我一直都是她
I am she who has always been.

624
00:44:30,050 --> 00:44:31,300
我们好像把她弄崩溃了
I think we broke her.

625
00:44:32,530 --> 00:44:33,910
糟糕
Oops.

626
00:44:40,060 --> 00:44:41,130
天啊
Oh, my God.

627
00:44:52,350 --> 00:44:54,360
真好吃  真神奇
Tasting. What a concept.

628
00:45:01,210 --> 00:45:04,280
其实  这样是不符合规定的
You know, this ain't exactly according to regulations.

629
00:45:06,130 --> 00:45:07,850
这就是他吗
So, this is him?

630
00:45:08,610 --> 00:45:10,110
是的  女士
Yes, ma'am.

631
00:45:11,090 --> 00:45:13,600
他的全部就这样装在里面了
All of him somehow fits in here.

632
00:45:18,970 --> 00:45:21,840
? I'm here ?

633
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:24,800
? You're gone ?

634
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:27,890
? Hearts break ?

635
00:45:27,890 --> 00:45:30,440
希望你不会觉得我太冒昧  不过
You know, I hope you don't find me too forward, but, um,

636
00:45:31,110 --> 00:45:33,400
遇见你这样的人让人有了信念
meeting someone like you kinda gives a man faith.

637
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:37,450
什么样的信念  我还说不好
In what, I... can't exactly say.

638
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:39,670
我也说不好
Yeah, me neither.

639
00:45:40,330 --> 00:45:42,120
我认为  这就是让我们相信
You know, I think it comes down to just

640
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:43,730
我们看不到的事情
believing in somethin' we can't see

641
00:45:43,730 --> 00:45:45,110
因为我们知道它的存在
'cause we know it's there.

642
00:45:46,690 --> 00:45:48,180
这就是我们继续前进的动力
That's what keeps us going.

643
00:45:49,130 --> 00:45:50,660
也许吧
Maybe so.

644
00:45:52,650 --> 00:45:54,260
好了  谢谢你
Well, thank you.

645
00:45:54,260 --> 00:45:56,760
我该走了
I'm-I'm gonna, I'm gonna get going.

646
00:45:57,220 --> 00:45:59,800
我多嘴问一下  你要去哪
Where to, if you don't mind me asking?

647
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:02,440
我也没想好  不过
I'm not exactly sure yet but, um...

648
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:04,500
我要去找个人问一首歌
I've gotta go see a man about a song.

649
00:46:05,710 --> 00:46:08,090
-祝你好运  -你也是
- Well, good luck. - You too.

650
00:46:20,150 --> 00:46:21,190
女士
Se?orita.

651
00:46:23,510 --> 00:46:25,240
他说我们要在这拐弯了
He say this is where we turn.

652
00:46:25,470 --> 00:46:26,810
你要继续往北走  对吧
You go more norte, si?

653
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:28,420
是的
Uh, si.

654
00:46:28,430 --> 00:46:30,040
应该是往北
Norte, I think.

655
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:31,110
好的
Okay.

656
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:37,240
小姐  路上小心
Se?orita, tengo cuidado.

657
00:46:37,390 --> 00:46:39,640
你们也是   谢谢
You too. Thanks.

658
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:18,320
卡车驿站

659
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:38,930
你不会是往北走吧
You're not going north by any chance, are you?

660
00:47:38,930 --> 00:47:40,580
就是往北
Sure as hell am.

661
00:47:40,580 --> 00:47:42,920
-你要去哪  -伊利诺伊州开罗
- Where you headed? - Cairo, Illinois?

662
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:44,570
上来吧
Hop in.

663
00:48:03,210 --> 00:48:05,250
