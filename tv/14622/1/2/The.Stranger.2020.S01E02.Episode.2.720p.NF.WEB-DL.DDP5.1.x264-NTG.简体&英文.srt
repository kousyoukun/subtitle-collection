- Footballs? - Lunch.

153
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:48,660
昨晚吃剩的咖喱鸡
Last night's chicken jalfrezi.

154
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,090
全世界最美味的三明治
Best sandwich ever.

155
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:55,650
-你想来一个吗  -不用了
- Do you want one? - You're okay, mate.

156
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,070
那玩意好臭
That stinks.

157
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,950
犹如天堂一般臭
Stinks like heaven.

158
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:03,920
柯琳今早几点出门的
Oh, what time did Corinne go in this morning?

159
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,400
-我都没看到她的车  -是啊  她...
- I didn't see her car. - Yeah, I know, she...

160
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,710
起得很早  她去参加早餐俱乐部了
Early bird. She's doing the breakfast club.

161
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:14,420
我很赞成  但我从8点30工作到3点够累了
I heartily approve but 8:30 till 3:00 is enough for me.

162
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:17,230
所以她才能拿到"年度杰出教师"奖
That's what gets you "Teacher of the Year" award.

163
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:18,750
她昨晚跑哪去了
Where was she last night?

164
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:19,710
怎么回事
What happened?

165
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:21,990
学生们给你颁大奖  你却不露面
Pupils give you the top prize and you don't show.

166
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:23,340
我可不会错过这种事
Watch me miss that.

167
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:24,980
我也不会得这个奖就是了
Watch me get that.

168
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:27,080
我不是窥探你们隐私
Not prying or anything, you know,

169
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:28,660
如果我越界了  你直说就是
if I'm sticking my nose in just tell me to--

170
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:30,760
不不  她只是...
No, no, it's, you know, she's...

171
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,640
胃抽筋
Stomach cramps.

172
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:34,400
哥们
Oh, mate.

173
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:36,340
你这么说我还有胃口吗
Put me off my sandwich, why don't you?

174
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:41,180
好吧  看看你都听些什么歌
Right. Let's see what you're listening to.

175
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:46,070
*我想换身衣服  换个发型  焕然一新*
*Wanna change my clothes My hair, my face*

176
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,430
*老天  但我毫无进展*
*Man, I ain't getting nowhere*

177
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:52,460
*我就住在这样的破地方*
*I'm just living in a dump like this*

178
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:54,800
*某处正发生着大事*
*There's something happening somewhere*

179
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:58,990
*宝贝  我就是知道*
*Baby, I just know that there is*

180
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:01,290
*你不能放火*
*You can't start a fire*

181
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:24,910
我得和你聊两句
I need to talk to you.

182
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:28,020
这个镇  我们之间为何毫无隐私
This town... Why do we have to know each other's business?

183
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:29,160
谁告诉你的
Who told you?

184
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:31,350
告诉我什么  什么意思
Told me what? What do you mean?

185
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:32,550
你知道她在哪吗
Do you know where she is?

186
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:34,450
她昨晚是不是在你家过夜
Did she stay at yours?

187
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:35,600
谁
Who?

188
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:38,830
柯琳  她昨晚没回家
Corinne. She didn't come home last night.

189
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:41,380
没有  我在替她主持早餐俱乐部
No. I'm just covering her breakfast club.

190
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:44,240
薇姬  怎么了
Vicky, what is it?

191
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:45,740
别在这里说
Not here.

192
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:58,540
我...不知道该怎么办  我该知道的
I... I don't know what to do, and I should,

193
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:00,080
因为我是她妈妈  如果我不知道...
'cause I'm her mom, and if I don't know--

194
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,600
等等  你在说什么
Whoa, wait. What are we talking about here?

195
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,580
埃拉出事了
It's Ella.

196
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:07,360
-埃拉  -埃拉手机里的照片
- Ella? - The photos from Ella's phone

197
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:09,510
被人发到网上了
have been posted online by someone.

198
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:11,210
是近距离拍她的...
Close-up photos of...

199
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:12,580
私处
her privates.

200
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:13,730
什么
What?

201
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:16,030
好吧
Okay, hey.

202
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,330
我要怎么办
What do I do, though?

203
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:21,270
我已经把那些照片撤掉了  但如果已经被分享了
You know, I've taken the photos down but if they've been shared,

204
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:23,410
肯定流出去了  那我要怎么保护她
then they're out there, so how do I protect her?

205
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:26,080
你说是别人发的
You say someone else posted these?

206
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,900
是的  但是从她手机里发出去的
Yeah, but they were sent from her phone.

207
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,790
好吧  埃拉14岁
Right, well, Ella's 14,

208
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:32,060
所以这应该算是侵犯儿童罪
so this would be considered child abuse.

209
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:33,710
你得去报警
You're gonna have to go to the police.

210
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:35,750
埃拉说那些照片不是她的
Ella says the photos aren't of her.

211
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:36,880
但有人说那是她的
Yeah. But someone's claiming they are,

212
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,210
这是别人设计的
someone's done this to her.

213
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:40,890
好了  听着
All right, look...

214
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:43,440
这是一名家庭律师
This is a family lawyer.

215
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,080
你先给她打个电话吧
Why don't you give her a call first?

216
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:47,790
谢谢
Thanks.

217
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:52,620
柯琳在哪里  抱歉
And Corinne's where, sorry?

218
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:54,850
就上次缺课
She's not missed school since...

219
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:56,430
还是流产那次
since she lost the baby.

220
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:58,460
对不起
Sorry.

221
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:00,890
我知道我不该随便提这种事
I know that's not something I should just casually refer to.

222
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:01,720
没关系
It's fine.

223
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,230
她在哪里
Where is she?

224
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:12,080
问题就是  我...
That's it, I, uh...

225
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:13,770
我不知道
I have no idea.

226
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:14,990
我不知道
I don't know.

227
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:16,850
我们只收到了...
All I've got is this...

228
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:20,670
一条她说她需要时间的短信
text saying that she needs time.

229
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:21,590
好吧
Okay.

230
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,440
她昨晚也给我发短信了
She texted me as well last night.

231
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,730
什么  她给你发了短信  她说什么了
What, she texted you? What did she say?

232
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:27,930
她今天不会来了
That she won't be in today.

233
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:29,760
给我看看
Show me. Show me.

234
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:31,280
我没带手机
I don't have my phone on me.

235
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,530
但没说别的
But it was just that.

236
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:34,670
教员们需要代班时就会发短信
That's what staff do when they need cover.

237
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:39,420
-我知道你们之间一直有问题  -什么
- I know you two have been having issues. - What?

238
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:40,880
我不想掺和进去
I don't wanna get in the middle.

239
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,680
她说我们一直有问题
She said we've been having issues?

240
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:44,760
抱歉  薇姬  奥利维亚很不舒服
Sorry, Vicky, Olivia's being sick,

241
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,460
一直很不舒服
like, constantly and everywhere.

242
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:48,120
-我马上来  -好
- I'll be right with you. - Okay.

243
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:50,210
我得走了
I have to go.

244
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:52,170
薇姬
Vicky...

245
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,940
你知道什么我不知道的事吗
do you know something that I don't?

246
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,640
我没有
No. I don't.

247
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:09,170
没关系的  来  奥利维亚
It's okay. Come, Olivia.

248
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:10,400
我打电话给你妈妈
I'll call your mom.

249
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,100
你能帮帮但丁吗
Can you help out Dante?

250
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:21,870
你们能帮帮但丁吗
You guys helping out Dante?

251
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,160
早上好
Good morning.

252
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:38,910
对你来说是有可能
Definitely could be for you, yeah.

253
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:41,670
有人给你送了一个礼物
You've, um, had a gift-wrapped delivery.

254
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:43,820
可能是吃的
Could be something edible.

255
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,240
要我看一眼吗
Should I have a look?

256
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:46,840
谢谢你  不用了  就放那儿吧
Thank you, no, leave it.

257
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,120
上面还绑着气球
It's got a balloon attached.

258
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,560
放那儿吧
Leave it, all right?

259
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,680
你打电话就为了说这个吗
Is this why you called?

260
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,000
不  不
Oh, no, no.

261
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:52,800
凯兹刚刚给了我
Katz has just handed me

262
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,610
但丁·甘纳森的医院毒理学报告
the hospital toxicology report on Dante Gunnarsson.

263
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:56,960
我正看着他呢
I'm looking at him.

264
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,190
好吧  他那晚肯定是纵情狂欢
Okay, well, he must've been partying that night,

265
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:01,110
因为他体内除了九单位的酒精
because aside from the nine units of alcohol

266
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:02,650
和大麻以外
and cannabis in his system,

267
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:05,150
还检测出有摇头丸
he's also tested positive for MDMA.

268
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:07,110
是吗
Oh, has he?

269
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:08,680
家长还说
So much for the parental,

270
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:11,280
"他只会适量抽一些家种大麻"
"He only smokes home-grown weed in moderation."

271
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:13,470
说不定他们还在家制摇头丸呢
Maybe they're cooking up Mandy as well.

272
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:14,370
是啊
Yeah.

273
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,170
我们得查出但丁那晚干了什么
We need to find out what Dante was up to that night.

274
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:19,560
我这就去看看技术组对他手机的分析如何了
Yeah. I'm heading to see how the tech team are doing with his phone.

275
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:22,030
好  任何指向他去了哪里
Good, yeah, anything that lets us know where he was

276
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:23,760
或和谁一起的线索都行
and who he was with.

277
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:24,560
嗯
Yeah.

278
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,680
我们得快点  别被学校发现我们不在
We'll have to be quick so they don't miss us at school.

279
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:41,280
我们可以直接拿去扔掉
We could just take it down to the dump.

280
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:43,270
那边全是监控摄像头
They've got CCTV all over that place.

281
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:52,910
你们在搞什么
What the fuck are you doing?

282
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:57,540
臭死了
Oh, it stinks.

283
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:59,980
-搞什  -那是只美洲驼
- What the...? - That's a fucking llama!

284
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:01,010
是羊驼
Alpaca.

285
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:02,810
你们怎么会有个美洲驼的头
Why have you got a llama head in here?

286
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:03,790
其实是羊驼
Alpaca, actually.

287
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:05,510
因为那天晚上狂欢晚会以后
Because after the rave the other night,

288
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:07,960
这混蛋开始拿石头丢我窗户
this clown starts throwing stones at my window.

289
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:09,540
我往外看
When I look out...

290
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:14,750
他就举着那个  脸上表情你想象不出来
he's off his face more than you can believe, holding that up.

291
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,220
但为什么在这里
But why is it here?

292
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,830
因为他没法回家
'Cause he couldn't go home.

293
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:19,690
真的  你不知道他当时状态多糟
Really, you have no idea how bad he was.

294
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:21,340
-他得在这里留宿  -好吧
- He had to stay here. - Okay.

295
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:22,420
那为什么它还在这里
Why is it still here?

296
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:24,630
我们就在想这事  怎么处理掉它
That's what we're trying to sort, how to get rid of it.

297
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,990
-迈克  -干嘛  怎么了
- Mike? - What? What is it?

298
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,540
你怎么了
What are you doing?

299
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:43,050
该死的  你们两个看起来好奇怪
Bloody hell. You both looked weird.

300
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:44,280
就像
That was...

301
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:47,270
就像那天晚上  不管我喝了什么
That was like the other night, like whatever I took

302
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:49,360
还在我体内
is still in my system.

303
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:52,980
肯定有人在我的饮料里掺东西了
Like, someone must've spiked my drink or something.

304
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:55,600
真的  我都要疯了
No, I was in Crazyville.

305
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,940
对  把大麻和伏特加混着来
Yes, from mixing weed and vodka.

306
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:59,040
我以前见过你这样
I've seen you like that before.

307
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,860
-不对  不至于像这样  -就是
- No, never, not like that. - Yeah.

308
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:02,640
我看见你欺负但丁了
I saw you have a go at Dante.

309
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:05,300
那我还看见你跟他一起走了
And I saw you going off with him.

310
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,870
我们能不能先把头处理掉
Okay, can we deal with what we're gonna do with this head?

311
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:09,120
-别啊  -怎么了
- Oh no! - What?

312
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,060
我爸
My dad.

313
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,710
你妈在干什么
What is your mum doing?

314
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,080
就是什么瑜伽园艺
It's just some yoga gardening thing.

315
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:43,140
我们要是在这里  我爸会看见的
Well, my dad's gonna see us if we stay here.

316
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:45,720
今天得把那颗头处理掉
Gotta get rid of that head today.

317

320
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:19,320
-为什么我非得最后一个  -因为你最小
- Why do I have to be last anyway? - Because you're the little one.

321
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,350
但是我们为什么要装固话
But why have a landline anyway?

322
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:23,250
小子们  小子们

你干什么呢
What are you doing?!

325
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,730
因为会疼  对不对  就是这样
Because it hurts, doesn't it? Exactly.

326
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:29,700
麻烦别闹了

336
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:49,350
因为不管你们喜不喜欢  我们都是一家人
Because whether you like it or not, we are a family!

337

339
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:54,110
我的天啊
Oh, my God!

340
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:01,610
如果我是你
If I were you...

341
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,720
就给你两个儿子做个亲子鉴定
I'd run DNA checks on your two boys.

342
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,540
好的  稍等
Sure, sure. One moment.

343
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:12,570
好
Yep.

344
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:16,760
请问你们卖不卖
Do you sell...

345
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:21,080
-基因检测工具  -有的
- DNA kits, testing kits? - We do, yeah.

346
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:47,110
那小子们呢
What about the boys?

347
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:48,610
-小子们  -他们是我的吗
- The boys? - Are they mine?

348
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,950
-他们是我的吗  -是的
- Are they mine? - Yes!

349
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:04,060
你怎么能问我这种话
How can you even ask me that?

350
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:14,920
有个女人
There was this woman.

351
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:16,850
苏珊·霍普
Suzanne Hope.

352
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,360
所以她假怀孕了
So she faked a pregnancy?

353
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,160
怎么了
What's up?

354
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:45,940
没什么  我就是要在市政厅
Nothing. I've just got a meeting

355
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,660
跟开发商开个会
with the developers at the town hall.

356
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:50,570
就是些程序上的法律问题
It's, you know, procedural, legal stuff.

357
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:51,870
对  你跟我说过
Yeah, you told me.

358
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:54,510
是跟市政的重要会议
This is the big one with the council.

359
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,320
对
Yeah.

360
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,460
一切都很顺利
Well, everything's in order.

361
00:17:58,150 --> 00:17:59,320
那你在担心什么事
So what's on your mind?

362
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:01,280
见到你是很开心
I mean, it's nice to see you,

363
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,700
但你来这里一定是有消息要告诉我  对吧
but you didn't come here just to tell me nothing, did you?

364
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:06,210
对
No.

365
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,550
你能帮我找一个女人吗
Can you track down a woman for me?

366
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:12,800
苏珊·霍普
Suzanne Hope.

367
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:14,790
她...
She's...

368
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:16,670
大概25到30岁
mid- to late 20s,

369
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:19,390
很可能住在离这30英里范围内
probably lives within a 30-mile radius of here.

370
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:20,640
你以为我是什么人
Who do you think I am?

371
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:24,140
退休警察  找人你比我擅长
An ex-copper who'll do a better job of it than I will.

372
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:27,500
而且有酬劳  我会免除今天会议的费用
And not for nothing. I'll knock today's meeting off the bill.

373
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:30,350
不用了  那钱用来养孩子吧
Nah, feed your kids.

374
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:31,990
尽管收我费
Charge me.

375
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,420
苏珊·霍普
Suzanne Hope?

376
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:37,300
你还知道她什么
What else do you know about her?

377
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:41,910
她有时会在外面假装自己怀孕了
She sometimes goes around pretending to be pregnant.

378
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:43,640
怀孕八个月
Like, eight months pregnant.

379
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,810
她会穿上一个...假肚子
She wears a fake... bump.

380
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:48,050
她是我妻子的朋友
It's a friend of my wife.

381
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:50,340
那就问你妻子她在哪啊
So ask your wife where she is.

382
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:55,910
好吧  我会想想办法
Okay, I'll see what I can do.

383
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:58,270
你去拯救我的家
And you go and save my home.

384
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:35,760
喂  我正想找你
Hello. Just the person.

385
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,480
你寄给我的那样小东西
You know that little thing you sent to me?

386
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,860
是不是绑着气球的
Does it come with a balloon?

387
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:42,500
是什么  我还没看到
What is it? 'Cause I haven't seen it yet.

388
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:45,100
你最好一个人时打开它
You might wanna open that when you're on your own.

389
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:45,800
为什么
Why?

390
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:48,020
算了  当我没问
No, never mind.

391
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:48,950
你今晚有什么安排
What are you doing tonight?

392
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:50,600
我想见你  我可以过去
'Cause I want to see you. I can drop in.

393
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:53,240
我六点后才回来  我正在去镇上
Well, not before 6:00, 'cause I'm on my way up to town.

394
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:54,970
你去见金柏莉吗
Oh, you going to see Kimberley?

395
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:56,340
希望能见到
Hoping to.

396
00:19:56,450 --> 00:19:57,160
很好  听着
Well, great, listen,

397
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,910
我晚点有件事想听听你的意见
I just need to pick your brains later about something.

398
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:02,870
-但丁的手机  -海蒂  我得挂了
- Dante's phone. - Oh, Heidi, I'm gonna have to go.

399
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,360
我今晚去哪里找你
Where am I coming to tonight?

400
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,050
你家还是咖啡店
House or café?

401
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,620
咖啡店  来咖啡店找我
Café. Come to the café.

402
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,160
好  亲爱的  我大概八点去找你
Okay, love, I'll see you about 8:00.

403
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,930
-好  再见  -再见
- Okay, bye. - Bye.

404
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:19,350
看这个  他手机上有个奇怪的应用
Have a look at this. He's got this weird app.

405
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,480
是没有标注地点的地图
It's a map without place names.

406
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,990
没有街道号  什么都没写
There's nothing, no road numbers, nothing.

407
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:26,070
但如果你熟悉这区域
But if you know the area...

408
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:29,670
-就是这附近  -看这个  在荒郊野岭
- That's around here. - Have a look at this. Middle of nowhere.

409
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:30,520
标记了一个地点
There's a pin drop.

410
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,780
距离那里不到一英里  就是发现羊驼的地方
And less than a mile from where that alpaca was found.

411
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:34,940
另外还有一系列匿名短信
Plus there's a whole list of anonymous messages

412
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:37,320
表明三晚前出了事
indicating there was something happening three nights ago.

413
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:38,690
"我们马上就来"
"On our way."

414
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:40,820
"找到你"  "我能看见你"
"Hunting you down." "I can see you."

415
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:42,820
但没有具体信息
But nothing specific.

416
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:45,630
这是为了不让我们这些外人知道他们在说什么
Yeah, so people like us don't know what they're on about.

417
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:49,240
好  带我们去标记地点
Right, take us to the pin drop.

418
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:52,410
你想先打开那个绑着气球的盒子吗
Do you wanna open that box with the balloon on it first?

419
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:53,480
不了  谢谢
No thanks.

420
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:55,050
为什么问  你看过里面了吗
Why? Have you had a look?

421
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:56,020
当然没有
Of course not.

422
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:11,620
埃德加
Edgar.

423
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:24,300
十年前  多党议员
Ten years ago, cross-party councilors

424
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:27,090
认为这条贫民区街道应进行拆除
deemed this street as fit for slum clearance.

425
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:30,180
时至今日  我们将提供240套
And now here we are, offering 240

426
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:33,240
包括单卧  两卧和三卧的抢手公寓
highly desirable one, two and three bedroom apartments,

427
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,900
其中25%
twenty-five percent of which

428
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:37,620
是经济适用房  然而
are for affordable housing, and yet, one...

429
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:38,710
有一个男人
one man...

430
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:39,920
他的委托人
his client,

431
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:42,490
想阻挠五百人过上更好的生活
wants to derail a better life for 500 people

432
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:45,600
其原因不过是  他那破旧的家是他的城堡
for no better reason than his derelict home is his castle.

433
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,900
我的委托人享有权利
My client has rights.

434
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:49,420
市议会对他颁发了强制征购令
The council issued a compulsory purchase order against him.

435
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:50,530
我们会和他们
We will fight them and

436
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:52,210
以及你和你的公司抗争到底
you and your company every inch of the way.

437
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:54,820
不止因为你根本没打算提供经济适用房
Because you have no intention of providing affordable housing.

438
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:57,730
等工程开工  你就会声称成本上涨
No. Once construction starts, you'll claim that costs are rising

439
00:21:57,730 --> 00:21:58,900
这25%住房
and that this 25 percent

440
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,880
就会缩减为20%  然后再缩减为10%
will shrink to 20 percent and then ten percent--

441
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,760
这项工程的成本是经过准确计算的
This project is properly costed.

442
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:05,020
幸好  我们可能永远无法得知这是不是真的
Well, thankfully, we may never find out if that's true.

443
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:05,890
幸好
Thankfully?

444
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:08,120
你说"幸好"是什么意思
What do you mean, "thankfully"?

445
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,440
这是议会需要的
The council needs this.

446
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,780
这是国家需要的
The country needs this.

447
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:13,040
住宅加盖非常重要
More housing is everything.

448
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,050
没有家的人根本算不上是一个人
A man without a home ceases to be a man.

449
00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:16,340
你只是想趁机捞一笔
You're just trying to make a killing.

450
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:18,620
我是想帮助五百人
I'm offering to empower 500 people

451
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:20,860
而你只是在帮助一人
for your single, solitary one.

452
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,780
拜托  你这么做是无偿的吗  不见得吧
Please, are you doing this pro bono? I don't think so.

453
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:25,310
你收费是多少
So how much do you charge?

454
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:28,100
你近三年的年收入是多少
Your annual income for the past three years, what's that?

455
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:29,220
这和我的工资无...
This is not about my salary--

456
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:31,130
这是一位大善人
Are we looking at a charity here

457
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:33,440
还是成功的律师
or a successful lawyer?

458
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:35,040
我觉得我能猜得出来
Think I can guess.

459
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:45,680
亚当  有时间吗
Adam, you got a moment?

460
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:48,810
你为什么不早点提醒我
Why didn't you warn me?

461
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:50,870
你为什么不打个电话或发短信
Why didn't you phone or text?

462
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:52,420
我不知道那家公司是你的
I had no idea you owned that company.

463
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:55,810
-我是隐名合伙人  -或许也没那么隐
- I'm a silent partner. - Or not so silent.

464
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:57,970
爸爸...
Dad...

465
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:00,630
你知道那条街道是我长大的地方
That street is where I grew up, you know that.

466
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:01,720
那时候就是个破地方
It was a shithole then.

467
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,950
但是我最早的一些记忆都是在那个破地方
But some of my earliest memories are of that shithole.

468
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:06,860
听着  我...对那地方也有感情
Okay, look, I have... I have feelings about the place too.

469
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:09,500
那就别只顾着压榨  做点贡献
So don't just make a profit out of it, give something back.

470
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:11,950
拜托  亚当  你太感情用事
Come on, Adam, you're being sentimental.

471
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:14,650
哪个脑子正常的人还会想住在那地方
Who in their right mind would wanna live there now?

472
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,150
马丁·吉连
Martin Killane.

473
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:17,970
我说"脑子正常的人"
I said, "in their right mind."

474
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:22,670
拜托  我是想改善那一带
Oh, come on. I'm offering to improve the area.

475
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:24,790
托马斯和瑞恩最近怎么样
How are Thomas and Ryan?

476
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,770
你要是给他们打过电话  自然知道
If you ever called them, you'd know.

477
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,930
是啊  你可能没有经历过
Yes, well, you may never experience this,

478
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:31,170
但是重组家庭是很需要时间的
but having a second family is very time-consuming.

479
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:32,490
他们是你的孙子
They're your grandsons.

480
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,500
我的两个孩子也是你的弟弟
And my two boys are your brothers.

481
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,550
同父异母的弟弟
Half brothers.

482
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:36,890
你什么时候给他们打过电话
When do you ever call them?

483
00:23:39,530 --> 00:23:40,950
普莱斯先生  车到了
Mr. Price, car's here.

484
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:43,320
等这一切都结束了
Well, when all this is done,

485
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:45,260
我们尽量多互相走动吧
let's try and see more of each other.

486
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:47,720
我们所有人  温蒂  柯琳  还有小子们
All of us. Wendy, Corinne, the boys.

487
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,940
柯琳最近怎么样
How is Corinne, by the way?

488
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:50,340
她都在做什么  她还好吗
What's she up to? Is she well?

489
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:52,720
嗯  她很好
Yeah, yeah, she's fine.

490
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:54,580
很好  我喜欢柯琳
Good, good. I like Corinne.

491
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,950
不过她每个月都会和我说托马斯和瑞恩的近况
She updates me about Thomas and Ryan every month, of course.

492
00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:22,560
妈妈
Hey, Mom.

493
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:25,010
你还好吗
Oh, are you all right?

494
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:27,640
-没想到你会来  -是啊
- Nice surprise. - Yeah.

495
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:29,390
-你怎么跑来这里了  -猜你可能有课
- How come you're here? - Thought you might have lectures.

496
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:31,320
是啊  早上就有一节
Oh, yeah, I have one first thing.

497
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:33,940
多细胞性与细胞通讯
Multicellularity and cell communication.

498
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:35,070
你怎么跑来了
How come you're here?

499
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:37,960
包挺好看啊
Nice bag, isn't it?

500
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:40,670
是啊  看来你是来逛街了
Yeah. Is this a shopping expedition, then?

501
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:42,170
-应该吧  -太好了
- I suppose. - Great.

502
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:44,510
我昨晚乐透中了四个数字
Well, I won four numbers on the lottery last night,

503
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:45,630
所以午餐我请
so lunch is on me.

504
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:47,960
我带你吃好的  六个数字中了四个
Yeah, I'm taking you out. Four out of six.

505
00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:49,720
我还以为至少能有好几百镑
So I was thinking hundreds of pounds at least,

506
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,570
甚至上千  但竟然只有62镑
maybe a thousand, but 62.

507
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:52,990
不过还能付得起一顿午餐  不要和我争...
It still buys us lunch. No arguments--

508
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:54,340
如果我告诉你
What if I told you

509
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:56,580
我很清楚你为什么能付得起呢
I know exactly why you can afford it?

510
00:24:57,660 --> 00:25:00,560
还有这包  我什么都知道了
And this, as in I know everything.

511
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:03,110
找个甜心.com
FindYourSugarBaby.Com.

512
00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:05,550
妈妈  那...
Mom, that's...

513
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,490
听着  那只是一些
Listen. That's literally just old men

514
00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:09,390
想带年轻女人一起吃晚餐的老男人
wanting to take young women out to dinner.

515
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:10,600
不会发生什么越界的事
Nothing beyond that happens.

516
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,150
发生了很多事
Oh, plenty happens.

517
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:17,650
你现在吊着三个呢
And you've got three on the go at the moment.

518
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:18,930
你算什么
What does that make you?

519
00:25:18,930 --> 00:25:19,900
-谁给你看的  -这不重要
- Who showed you? - Doesn't matter.

520
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:21,250
-这很重要  -好吧
- It does matter. - All right.

521
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:22,860
我从没见过她们  今后也再不想见到她们了
Never seen them before. Never want to see them again.

522
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:23,920
是她们在街上拦下我的
They stopped me in the street.

523
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,220
什么  她们要什么
Why? Wanting what?

524
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:26,760
一万镑
Ten thousand pounds.

525
00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:29,490
-什么  -否则这一切
- What? - Or all this...

526
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:30,980
都会发到网上
...goes online

527
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:33,170
所有人都能看到  金柏莉
for everyone to see, Kimberley.

528
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,670
现在是隐藏的  但他们黑入了网站
I mean, it's hidden for now, but they've hacked the site.

529
00:25:36,550 --> 00:25:40,020
如果我不付钱  你还能有什么光明未来
And if I don't pay, where's your glorious future then?

530
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:42,350
你还想做科研人员  做梦去吧
You wanna be a research scientist, forget it.

531
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:45,980
你还想教书  你想让孩子们喜欢上科学
You wanna teach, you wanna get kids excited about science...

532
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:49,390
如今的雇主会对每个人进行审查
Employers screen everyone nowadays.

533
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:52,220
他们会翻你的社交媒体  这些视频
They're all over your social media, and this...

534
00:25:52,410 --> 00:25:54,520
会出现在你的社交媒体上
will be all over yours.

535
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:57,540
天哪  我做了什么
Oh, God, what have I done?

536
00:25:58,380 --> 00:25:59,510
你为什么这么做
Why?

537
00:25:59,610 --> 00:26:02,430
我就...怎么说呢...事情失控了
It just... I don't know. It got out of hand.

538
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:03,600
那你为什么要开始做这个呢
Why'd you have to do it in the first place?

539
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,490
因为我大学三年让你背上了六万的债务
Because three years of uni gets you 60 grand in debt.

540
00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:09,140
-算了吧  -妈妈  是真的  六万
- Oh, go on. - No, Mom, it's true, 60 grand.

541
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:12,400
那些等你挣够了钱再还就行了
Which you don't have to pay until you're earning enough.

542
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,660
没关系的
And then it's nothing.

543
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:15,660
对你没关系  可是对我来说有关系
Nothing to you. It's not nothing to me.

544
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:18,760
对不起
Sorry.

545
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,630
亲爱的
Oh, darling.

546
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:22,340
妈妈  我真的好抱歉
Mom, I'm so sorry.

547
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,860
好了  会没事的
Okay, it'll be all right.

548
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:30,600
我会给他们钱的  他们今天就会收到
I'll pay them, they'll get their money today.

549
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,870
哪弄钱啊  妈妈
From where, Mom?

550
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,450
咖啡馆  还有我和乔安娜的旅行基金
Oh, from the café, from the trip fund with Johanna.

551
00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:36,280
不行  你为了旅行攒了那么久钱
No, you saved so long for that.

552
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:38,120
你觉得我在解决掉这件事之前
What, you think I'm gonna wanna do anything

553
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,400
会去做其他事吗
if this isn't fixed?

554
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:41,560
妈妈  我会还给你的
Look, Mom, I will pay you back.

555
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,420
-妈妈  我会还你的  -不不  不不不
- Mom, I will. - No, no. No, no, no.

556
00:26:43,570 --> 00:26:46,100
答应我  这事你再不能做了
You promise me that this stops now.

557
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:48,740
我答应  以后再不会了
I promise, it will never happen again.

558
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:49,860
-只是  -好吗
- Just... - Okay?

559
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:52,120
只是求你  千万别告诉爸爸
Just please, please don't tell Dad.

560
00:26:52,130 --> 00:26:53,740
好  你爸爸永远不会知道
All right, Dad will never know.

561
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:55,780
这从未发生过
This never happened.

562
00:26:57,090 --> 00:26:57,750
好吗
Okay?

563
00:27:00,050 --> 00:27:01,580
天哪
Oh, God.

564
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:21,770
这边  我们往这边走
Here, we wanna head this way.

565
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:39,150
开派对的地方
Oh, party time.

566
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:41,400
还有篝火
Bonfire too.

567
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,830
就是这儿  标记的地点就在这儿
This is the place. The pin drop's here.

568
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:48,880
羊驼在这里的哪个方向
The alpaca was where from here?

569
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:50,440
那边  一公里外
A mile that way.

570
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,810
我们在哪找到的但丁·甘纳森
And we found Dante Gunnarsson...?

571
00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:54,670
在那边  0.25公里  所以
That-a-way, quarter of a mile, so...

572
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:57,210
篝火  羊驼
bonfire, alpaca...

573
00:27:58,290 --> 00:27:59,050
但丁
Dante.

574
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,780
看起来这里来了很多人
Looks like there were a lot of people here.

575
00:28:03,170 --> 00:28:04,590
我们为什么没有接到投诉
How come we got no complaints?

576
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:10,620
但丁醒了
Dante's come round.

577
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:12,700
我们需要叫搜查队过来
Right, we're gonna need a search team here

578
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:14,220
与此同时我们得去跟他谈谈
while we go and speak to him.

579
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:16,630
我不知道我爸爸也参与其中
I didn't know my dad was involved.

580
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:17,610
这是我家
This is my home!

581
00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:18,850
他有许多家公司
He owns a lot of companies.

582
00:28:18,850 --> 00:28:20,180
我不知道这家也是他的
I didn't know he owned this one.

583
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:21,860
-为什么  那死混蛋  -我知道
- Why, that piece of shit! - I know.

584
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:23,340
他以前是我邻居
He used to be my neighbor!

585
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:24,320
没什么区别的
It doesn't make a difference.

586
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,720
法律还是支持你的
The law is still on your side.

587
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,920
他和他的公司不会赢的
Him and his company are not gonna win this.

588
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,370
希望你说的是真的
I certainly hope that's true.

589
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:33,460
上来
Come on up here.

590
00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:35,980
我找到你那个苏珊·霍普了
I found you your Suzanne Hope.

591
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,790
三个叫这个名字的
Well, found three of them,

592
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:41,460
但只有一个是20多岁
but only one of them was in her 20s.

593
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:43,360
我从来没上来过
I've never been up here.

594
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:48,650
这都是什么
Oh, what's all this?

595
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:51,280
我妻子留下的
Oh, my wife.

596
00:28:51,290 --> 00:28:53,120
她逃跑之前  我受不了这些
Before she ran off, I couldn't stand them.

597
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:56,150
她离开后  我渐渐喜欢上它们了
Then when she left, I kind of grew to like them.

598
00:28:56,650 --> 00:28:57,470
进来
Come on in here.

599
00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:03,850
我还会偶尔办些悬案  失踪人口
I still work on an odd cold case, missing persons.

600
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:07,290
如果没人帮你找你的亲人
If there's nobody to help you find a loved one,

601
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:10,180
这世界挺冷酷的...
it's a pretty cold world out there...

602
00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:11,800
你不知道
not knowing...

603
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:14,360
他们为什么走了  或者去了哪
why they've gone, where they are.

604
00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:16,510
最糟的莫过如此
It's the worst.

605
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:18,290
所以
So...

606
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:22,110
这至少可以给其中一些人一点点希望
it's good to at least be able to give some of them a little hope.

607
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:24,170
说到这个
Speaking of which,

608
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:25,230
给你
here you go.

609
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,600
苏珊·霍普
Suzanne Hope.

610
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,500

An address, anyway.

611
00:29:30,150 --> 00:29:30,840
谢谢
Thanks.

612
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:32,290
不好意思
Sorry.

613
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,100
我小儿子
My youngest.

614
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:36,590
喂  伙计  你妈妈打电话来了没
Hello, mate. Has your mom called?

615
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,510
没有
No.

616
00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:40,190
我被关在门外了  爸爸  我进不了家
And I'm locked out, Dad. I can't get in.

617
00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:42,130
她在哪  我要饿死了
Where is she? I'm starving.

618
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:43,320
你进不去吗  什么意思
What do you mean, you can't get in?

619
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,500
我没有钥匙
I don't have a key.

620
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:46,260
伙计  钥匙就在花盆下面
Mate, it's under the plant pot.

621
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:47,430
没在
It's not there.

622
00:29:47,430 --> 00:29:49,640
好吧  你去崔普家可以吗
Okay, why don't you go over to Tripp's?

623
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,120
爸爸  我有作业要写
Dad, I've got homework.

624
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,440
三大堆呢
Three lots.

625
00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:54,060
我的书都在里面
And my books are inside,

626
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:57,300
而且我饿了  我还想上厕所
and I'm hungry and I wanna go to the loo.

627
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:39,430
那是托马的女友
That's Tom's girl.

628
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,560
不好意思
Excuse me.

00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:49,920
-但丁  -但丁  护士

630
00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:53,670
-他怎么了  -别慌
- What's wrong with him? - Okay, don't panic.

631
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,350
什么  别...你说什么呢
What...? Don't... What do you mean?

632
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,740
你们最好...
I think it's best if...

633
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,430
不好意思  等等  几位
Excuse me. Excuse me, guys.

634
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:14,500
能跟你们说句话吗
Can I have a word?

635
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:18,530
我是格里芬警长
Hi, I'm DS Griffin,

636
00:31:18,530 --> 00:31:19,910
这是罗斯警员
this is DC Ross.

637
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,550
你们是但丁的朋友吧  一个学校的
You're Dante's friends, right? You all go to the same school?

638
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:24,220
-对  -我们算不上朋友
- Yeah-- - We're not really friends.

639
00:31:24,910 --> 00:31:27,540
我们不算特别铁的朋友
I mean, we're not best friends.

640
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:28,990
我们是他的朋友  他是我们的朋友
We're his friends, he's our friend.

641
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:29,840
你说什么呢
What are you talking about?

642
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,510
没事的
It's okay. It's okay.

643
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:33,510
他现在状态挺好的
He's in the right place now though.

644
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:37,250
正好你们在  你们是否知道前两天晚上
While we've got you, do any of you know about a gathering

645
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:38,640
在林子里的一场集会
the other night in the woods?

646
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:41,360
三晚前  但丁受伤那晚
Three nights ago, the night Dante was hurt.

647
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:43,580
-不知道  -抱歉
- No. - Sorry.

648
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:47,470
但丁摔了一跤  摔得很远
Dante took a fall. He fell quite a way, which...

649
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:50,770
我们必须查查  他是自己一人  还是...
for us begs questions. You know, was he on his own, or...

650
00:31:51,130 --> 00:31:54,300
有别人也跟这事有关
were others around maybe involved?

651
00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:57,680
因为如果有其他人  那可能就严重了
'Cause if there were, this could get serious.

652
00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:00,480
尤其是如果他挺不过来
Especially if he doesn't pull through.

653
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:06,760
我还能说点什么
What else can I tell you?

654
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:09,390
-毒理报告  -对了
- Toxicology? - Oh, yeah.

655
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:12,090
但丁体内检测出了
Dante had... cannabis

656
00:32:12,090 --> 00:32:14,740
大麻和摇头丸
and MDMA in his system, so...

657
00:32:14,930 --> 00:32:17,540
你们是否知道  他会经常嗑摇头丸吗
any of you know, does he do ecstasy regularly?

658
00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:19,940
我不知道
I don't know.

659
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:21,600
好吧
Okay.

660
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:23,680
你们登记名字了吗

很好
Great.

664
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:28,490
如果我们没什么进展
'Cause if we don't make enough progress,

665
00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:30,960
你们应该知道  我们会进行全面药检
you ought to know we'll do a blanket drug test

666
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:34,120
检查所有但丁的朋友  可能会在学校做
on Dante's friends, probably do it through school.

667
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:37,890
好  谢谢
Okay, cheers.

668
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:39,210
谢谢
Thanks.

669
00:32:45,870 --> 00:32:47,620
你不能给一整个年纪做药检
You can't drug test the whole year.

670
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:48,810
没必要
I don't need to.

671
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:50,950
我得到我想要的了  你看到他们的表情了吗
I've got what I want. Did you see their faces?

672
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:52,400
他们有所隐瞒
They're hiding something.

673
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:57,550
你去哪了
Where've you been?

674
00:32:58,350 --> 00:32:59,570
快点  我要饿死了
Hurry up, I'm starving.

675
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:00,460
好啦
All right.

676
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:01,450
晚饭吃什么
What's for tea?

677
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:04,560
我不知道  叫个披萨啊

678
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:06,670

684
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:16,250
不吃凤尾鱼  是吧
No anchovies, right?

685
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:18,780
给托马斯也叫一个
Get one for Thomas as well.

686
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:22,320
她来过电话吗
Has she called?

687
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:23,740
没有  什么都没有
No. No, nothing.

688
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:25,950
好吧  听着
Okay. Well, look.

689
00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:28,840
以防你觉得我之前对你有所隐瞒
In case you thought I wasn't telling you something earlier...

690
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:30,490
这是她的短信
That's her text.

691
00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:32,290
"去不了了"
"Won't be in."

692
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:33,640
就没别的了
That was it.

693
00:33:37,770 --> 00:33:38,700
你说你知道
You said you knew that

694
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:40,750
柯琳和我之间一直有问题
Corinne and I have been having issues for a while.

695
00:33:41,330 --> 00:33:43,050
反正她是有什么烦心事
Well, something's been getting to her.

696
00:33:43,450 --> 00:33:44,650
你为什么这么认为
What makes you say that?

697
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:47,350
她这几周一直很紧张
She's been tense these last few weeks, you know?

698
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:50,020
就是...怎么说呢  就像你现在这样
Looking like, I don't know... like you, now.

699
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:51,230
压力很大
Stressed.

700
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:53,600
你报警了吗
Have you called the police?

701
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:54,900
说什么呢
And tell them what?

702
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:57,540
她发短信说她要离开几天
She sent a message saying that she needed a few days.

703
00:33:57,730 --> 00:33:59,160
你不知道她为什么那么说吗
You don't know why she said that?

704
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:02,470
-抱歉  -不
- Sorry. - No, it's...

705
00:34:05,290 --> 00:34:07,580
你联系律师谈埃拉的事了吗
Did you call that lawyer about Ella?

706
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,300
我担心一旦开始了
I'm worried that once I start the process,

707
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:12,450
就不受我控制
it'll run away with itself

708
00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:14,520
只会让埃拉的情况更糟
and make things even worse for Ella.

709
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:17,720
所以  我还在考虑
So, still thinking it over.

710
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:19,360
但是
Hey, though,

711
00:34:19,410 --> 00:34:22,410
如果你什么时候想过来谈谈什么的
if you wanna come over anytime to talk or whatever,

712
00:34:22,930 --> 00:34:24,110
别客气
just come.

713
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:25,260
好
Okay.

714
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:27,970
谢谢
Thanks.

715
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:32,390
-我不会把你们说出去的  -多谢了  薇姬
- Your secret's safe with me. - Cheers, Vicky.

716
00:34:34,690 --> 00:34:36,810
黛茜  要我送你回家吗
Daisy, want a lift home?

717
00:34:36,810 --> 00:34:37,750
不了  谢谢
No thanks.

718
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:38,970
你什么时候回家
What time will you be back?

719
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:40,260
我不知道  妈妈
I don't know, Mom.

720
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:43,470
反正不是现在  不会马上  也不会太晚
Not now, not soon, not late.

721
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:46,630
迈克  我本来希望你今早送我的
Mike, I was expecting a lift from you this morning.

722
00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:49,220
是啊  我还希望我老爸穿长裤呢
Yeah, and I was expecting my dad to wear trousers.

723
00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:04,840
好  我可能找到办法
Okay, I think I might have found a way

724
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:05,680
解决那颗羊驼头了
to get rid of that alpaca head.

725
00:35:05,690 --> 00:35:06,870
别说话
Yeah, no, shh.

726
00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:10,400
"大麻13天内能在尿检中检出"
"Urine tests show cannabis for 13 days."

727
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,170
还有我被下药的那玩意怎么办
What about what it was I was spiked with?

728
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:13,320
至少你能知道那究竟是什么
At least you'll find out what it was.

729
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,740
我们知道是什么  大麻和伏特加
We know what it was: weed and vodka.

730
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:15,940
老天
Oh, f...

731
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:17,510
黛茜  你为什么要来
Daisy, why are you even here?

732
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:19,950
我可能找到了帮你摆脱警察的办法
I might have found a way to get the police off your back.

733
00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:21,720
但如果你不想知道
But if you're not interested...

734
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:26,100
我在想  我们把那事跟这个联系起来
Okay, so I'm thinking, we link it to this,

735
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:28,100
就发生在两个月前  五英里外
which was five miles away, two months ago.

736
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:29,090
那么
So...

737
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:33,260
我们把头埋在林子里  周围画上撒旦符号
We bury the head in the woods surrounded by satanic symbols.

738
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:35,830
就像这样
Like this.

739
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:58,490
老天爷啊
God's sake.

740
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,500
看看这个
Look at this.

741
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:22,850
是个硬起来的老二  如果你们没见过的话
It's an erect penis, in case you haven't seen one before.

742
00:36:31,530 --> 00:36:33,750
我上了但丁的匿名应用
I'm on Dante's anonymous app,

743
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:36,300
这几个刚开始动了
and these have just started moving.

744
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:41,660
这就像定位狂人或瞥见
It's like GeoZilla or Glympse.

745
00:36:42,650 --> 00:36:43,870
能显示朋友的位置
It shows locations of friends,

746
00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:46,110
但这个不显示你看到的是谁
except this one doesn't show who you're looking at.

747
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:49,350
或许颜色能区分人
Maybe the colors tell you who they are.

748
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,650
然后往哪走
Where was it from here?

749
00:36:53,350 --> 00:36:55,590
我们要足够近  让警察能把两件事联系起来
So we're close enough for the police to make a connection.

750
00:36:58,090 --> 00:36:58,870
再往前走
Further on.

751
00:37:05,950 --> 00:37:07,290
亲爱的  我到了
Listen, babe, I'm here.

752
00:37:07,990 --> 00:37:10,650
我得挂了  回头联系你
Yeah, I've gotta go. I'll call you later.

753
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,670
我爱你  再见
I love you. Bye.

754
00:37:14,870 --> 00:37:17,140
回家  你  回家  快走吧
Home. You, home, come on.

755
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:18,890
-我来收拾  -你确定吗
- I can finish this. - Are you sure?

756
00:37:18,890 --> 00:37:20,560
当然  回家吧  我来记账
Yeah, go home. I'll do the accounts.

757
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,680
我喜欢做
I like to do it.

758
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:18,700
嗯
Yeah.

759
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:22,690
抱歉  我在找苏珊·霍普
Sorry, I'm looking for Suzanne Hope.

760
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,370
你找我老婆
You're looking for my wife?

761
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:26,970
是的  但...
Yeah, but, um...

762
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:29,020
-她不在  -你不懂
- She's not in. - No, you don't understand.

763
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:30,550
你妻子认识我妻子
Your wife knew my wife.

764
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:33,700
柯琳·普莱斯
Corinne Price.

765
00:38:33,790 --> 00:38:34,940
他们是大概...
They met maybe--

766
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:37,050
-你个混蛋  -你干什么
- You fuck! - Fuck are you doing?

767
00:38:37,050 --> 00:38:38,070
你个混...
You fucking...!

768
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:41,370
住手  住手
Stop it! Stop! Stop!

769
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:42,080
住手
Stop!

770
00:38:43,110 --> 00:38:45,310
离我家人远点  听到了吗
Stay away from my family! Do you hear me?!

771
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:47,810
进去
Get inside. Get inside.

772
00:38:52,850 --> 00:38:53,560
苏珊
Suzanne!

773
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,930
我只想问问你我妻子的事
I just wanna talk to you about my wife.

774
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:02,600
我要报警了
I'm calling the police.

775
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,530
报警去吧
Call the fucking police.

776
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:11,580
-喂  伙计  -爸爸  快回家来
- Hello, mate. - Dad? Dad, come home now.

777
00:39:11,690 --> 00:39:13,760
-怎么  发生什么了  -警察来了
- Why? What's happened? - The police are here!

778
00:40:01,930 --> 00:40:03,550
不  我们今晚不开门
No, we're not open tonight.

779
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:04,420
警察
Police.

780
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:11,590
道伊尔太太
Mrs. Doyle.

781
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:13,180
是金柏莉吗  是我女儿吗
Is this about Kimberley? Is this about my daughter?

782
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:13,680
发生什么事了吗
Has something happened?

783
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,200
你女儿完全没事
Your daughter's absolutely fine.

784
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:18,270
但我们是得谈谈金柏莉
But we do need to talk about Kimberley.

785
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:19,530
好
Okay.

786
00:40:20,370 --> 00:40:22,620
抱歉  我没看清你的身份证明
I'm sorry, I didn't really see your ID.

787
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:25,230
我是CCU的  网络犯罪部
I'm with the CCU, the Cyber Crime Unit.

788
00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:27,410
-网络犯罪  -对
- Cyber crime? - Yeah.

789
00:40:27,410 --> 00:40:30,910
我们在查一个叫找个甜心.com的网站
We're looking into a website called FindYourSugarBaby.Com.

790
00:40:30,910 --> 00:40:31,900
不
Oh, no.

791
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:35,270
我觉得没有律师在  我不该跟你谈
Look, I don't think I should speak to you without a solicitor.

792
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,810
道伊尔太太  我们不想找你女儿的麻烦
Mrs. Doyle, we're not interested in your daughter. Okay?

793
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:40,330
在我们看来  金柏莉也是名受害者
As far as we're concerned, Kimberley's a victim in all of this.

794
00:40:40,330 --> 00:40:42,140
别人不会理解的
Yeah, well, people won't understand that.

795
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:44,100
这事一旦公开  她的人生就毁了
The second this goes public, her life is ruined.

796
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:46,440
对  但我们能确保她绝对匿名
Yes, but we will guarantee her anonymity.

797
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:47,760
这我向你保证
You have my word on that.

798
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:48,850
我想找的是
I'm interested in finding

799
00:40:48,850 --> 00:40:51,410
建立这个网站的人
the people that put this site out there, okay?

800
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:53,250
那些利用金柏莉这样的年轻女孩
People that are using young women like Kimberley,

801
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:54,790
做勒索诱饵的人
as bait for blackmail.

802
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:57,520
这你当然最清楚不过了
Which is something you know all about, of course.

803
00:40:58,170 --> 00:41:00,790
可以告诉我他们最初怎么接触你的吗
Can you tell me how they first made contact with you?

804
00:41:01,910 --> 00:41:06,620
我正要离开时  在停车场被两个女人叫住了
I was leaving here and two women approached me in the car park.

805
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:07,600
两个女人
Two women?

806
00:41:07,690 --> 00:41:08,370
对
Yeah.

807
00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:11,320
-你会如何描述她们  -她们...
- How would you describe them? - Uh, they were...

808
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:13,780
年轻  20多  挺漂亮
young, 20s, pretty.

809
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:16,920
一个戴了棒球帽  一个是金发
One had a baseball cap, one had blond hair.

810
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:19,900
就在那儿等着我  他们给了我这个
It was just a setup. Look, they gave me this.

811
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,120
谢谢
Thank you.

812
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:26,340
谢了
Ta.

813
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,330
你怎么知道我被勒索了
How'd you know I'd been blackmailed?

814
00:41:48,890 --> 00:41:50,810
我们找金柏莉谈过了
We spoke with Kimberley.

815
00:41:52,530 --> 00:41:53,190
什么时候
When?

816
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:55,270
今早上
This morning.

817
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:05,790
我要给我丈夫打个电话  我答应会打给他的
Yeah, I'm gonna call my husband because I said I'd ring.

818
00:42:05,790 --> 00:42:07,740
我们谈完前您可以先别打电话吗
Can you not make phone calls until we've finished?

819
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:09,230
不  不然他会奇怪的
Well, no, he'll think that's really odd.

820
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:10,730
如果我不马上打给他
If I don't call him now--

821
00:42:10,830 --> 00:42:12,620
-嗯  -能还我吗
- Yeah. - Would you give that back?

822
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:14,600
-等我们谈完的  -还我
- When we're finished. - Give it back!

823
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:20,870
这能行吗
Think this will work?

824
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:23,250
你埋头  我伪装成撒旦崇拜
You bury the head, I'll make it look satanic.

825
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:27,320
你能别出声吗
Can you be quiet?

826
00:42:28,830 --> 00:42:29,870
好了  放进去
Okay, tip it in.

827
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:36,090
该死
Fuck.

828
00:42:38,170 --> 00:42:39,790
你到底是怎么了
What's actually wrong with you?

829
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:40,940
我怕黑
I don't like the dark.

830
00:42:41,590 --> 00:42:42,260
好吧
All right.

831
00:42:44,610 --> 00:42:45,400
闭上眼睛
Close your eyes.

832
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:48,150
-那还是很黑  -呼吸
- It's still gonna be dark. - Just breathe.

833
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:59,000
这不好了
There you go.

834
00:43:01,950 --> 00:43:03,690
脑子小的好处
Perks of having a small brain.

835
00:43:03,890 --> 00:43:06,940
他总能那么做  好了
He's always been able to do that. Okay.

836
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:16,390
那么
So...

837
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:19,130
那晚跟但丁
the other night with Dante...

838
00:43:19,530 --> 00:43:20,240
你们
I mean...

839
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:22,710
发生什么事了吗  你们...
did anything happen? Did you--?

840
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:24,910
关掉手电
Turn the torch off.

841
00:43:25,210 --> 00:43:25,880
怎么了
What?

842
00:43:29,510 --> 00:43:30,200
跑
Run!

843
00:44:15,230 --> 00:44:16,390
我们之前谈过
We spoke earlier.
