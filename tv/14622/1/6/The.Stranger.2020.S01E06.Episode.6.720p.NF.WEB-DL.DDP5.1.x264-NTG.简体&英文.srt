他只肯跟你说话
he will only talk to you.

00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:24,220
我想跟你说说这件事
I wanted to tell you about it.

40
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:27,980
因为我只信任你
Because you're the only person I trust.

41
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,220
你能理解吗
Does that make sense?

42
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:36,820
谢谢
Thank you.

43
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,300
你见过我妻子的照片  娜塔莎
You've seen photos of my wife, Natasha.

44
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:54,260
她出现时  我以为我是这世上最幸运的男人
I thought I was the luckiest man alive when she came along.

45
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,780
她是那么美丽
She was so gorgeous and...

46
00:03:57,770 --> 00:04:00,220
难以驾驭  不好迎合
challenging and demanding.

47
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:04,450
她颠覆了我的世界
She turned my world upside down.

48
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:08,220
我崇拜她  我非常崇拜她
I adored her, I completely adored her.

49
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,540
但她渴求...
But, uh, she needs...

50
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,660
关注
attention, and...

51
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:17,580
而我是个整天忙碌的警察
I'm a cop working all hours.

52
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,220
所以她去找其他男人
So she meets other men.

53
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,240
我无法接受
And I can't handle it.

54
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:26,810
我说  "够了  我受够了"
And I say, "That's it, that's it." And...

55
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:29,490
她说  "不
she says, "No.

56
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,980
他们不算什么  你才是我的唯一
They're nothing. You're one, the only one.

57
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:34,810
只有你和我
It's you and me.

58
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:37,980
我们生个孩子吧"
Let's have a baby."

59
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:40,580
我们就生了
And we do.

60
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,250
克里斯出生时
And when Chris comes along...

61
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,000
这孩子改变了一切
this baby changes everything.

62
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:48,220
我都迷住了
I'm besotted.

63
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:52,810
我总处于一种难以置信的状态
I'm in a constant state of amazement.

64
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:56,610
养大这孩子
Raising this child...

65
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,140
成了我人生的意义
that's the meaning of life.

66
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,020
但是
But...

67
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:06,580
娜塔莎做不来
Natasha can't handle it.

68
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:08,810
她觉得太难了
She finds it hard.

69
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:12,580
所以我很重要
So I'm important.

70
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,370
能有这么个
And... to have this...

71
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,480
可爱的小孩跑向我
adorable toddler running towards me,

72
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:20,730
每次我回家都拥抱我
arms out every time I come home...

73
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,660
然后有次  有天  我早回家了
Then one time, one day, I come home early and...

74
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,700
娜塔莎打了一堆行李
Natasha has all these bags packed.

75
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:33,780
她站在那里
She's standing there.

76
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,810
我逮住了她
I've caught her, right?

77
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:39,050
她说
And she tells me...

78
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:42,360
她要离开我了  她要走了
that she's leaving me, she's going,

79
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:44,730
她还要带走克里斯
and she's taking Chris with her.

80
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:52,140
她对我说的那些话啊
Oh, the things she said to me.

81
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:57,300
我不知该说什么  我无语了
And I'm lost for words, I'm speechless.

82
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:00,900
然后她抓起克里斯
And then she grabs Chris...

83
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,340
开始往外走  她正要走  我爆发了
and starts to go, is actually going, and I lash out.

84
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:10,420
娜塔莎倒下了
And Natasha goes down.

85
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:13,340
她倒下了
She goes down, and...

86
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,050
我抱起了克里斯
I pick up Chris and...

87
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:20,020
去了别的房间  关上了门
go into the other room and close the door.

88
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:22,860
我...
And I...

89
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:27,100
我真的还想着  再回去跟她理论
I really thought I was going back to reason with her.

90
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:31,660
但她一开口  说要带走克里斯
But as soon as she spits out at me that she's taking Chris...

91
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:36,160
我一拳拳地
I land a second, a third,

92
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,140
不停地...
fourth, a fifth blow and...

93
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:40,930
然后
And...

94
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:45,810
就结束了
And it's over.

95
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:51,050
结束了
It was over.

96
00:06:57,930 --> 00:06:59,460
你会那么做吗
Would you do the like of that...

97
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:02,020
为了救你爱的人
to save the one you loved?

98
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,930
比如柯琳
Like Corinne, say?

99
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:06,260
因为可怕的是
Because the terrible thing is...

100
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:10,260
我从没想到自己能做出这样的事
I never thought I'd be capable of such a thing.

101
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:15,440
但我现在知道了
I... But I know now

102
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:18,780
为了保住那孩子  我还会那么做的
that I would do the same again to keep that child.

103
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,810
之后的事就不难了
And what followed wasn't hard.

104
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:27,220
我办过那么多凶杀案
I've been on so many murder cases, I...

105
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,300
我清楚怎么藏尸体
I know how to hide a body.

106
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:32,460
包起来
Wrap it up,

107
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,260
封得密不透风  敲开一面墙
seal it so it's airtight, open up a wall,

108
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,280
把尸体放进去
put the body in the wall,

109
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,020
再把墙砌好  恢复如初
patch it up so it's good as new.

110
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:49,610
难道没人
Did nobody...

111
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:51,580
找她吗
miss her?

112
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,480
嗯  她买了火车票
Yeah, well, she bought train tickets.

113
00:07:57,490 --> 00:07:58,370
她...
She...

114
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:01,360
取了钱
had withdrawn cash.

115
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:04,810
她还跟人说了她要走
She'd even told people that she was going.

116
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,300
丢下孩子
Leaving the child behind, that...

117
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:11,120
那让大家很震惊
that really shocked people.

118
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:13,980
什么样的妈妈会那么做  但是
What kind of mother does the like of that? But...

119
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:19,730
我让人们同情了我  所以我没被怀疑过
I pulled people over to my side, so I was never suspected.

120
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:26,100
我离开了警队  开始做全职老爸
I gave up the force and threw myself into being a full-time dad,

121
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,610
我很喜欢
which I loved.

122
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:30,050
你也知道小孩子什么样
You know what young kids are like.

123
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:32,140
总是要这要那
They can never have enough.

124
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:34,330
我奉献了一切
And I gave everything.

125
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,900
我奉献了一切
I gave everything.

126
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:42,020
我想那么做
I wanted to.

127
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:45,660
讽刺的是
And the irony is...

128
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:51,260
我自己养大的孩子已经很多年没跟我说过话了
that child I raised all on my own hasn't spoken to me for years.

129
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,900
那柯琳呢
What about Corinne?

130
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:02,810
什么
What?

131
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:05,450
她在哪
Where is she?

132
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:09,860
尸体被发现时  你...
When the body was found, you...

133
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:12,540
看着我  你说"对不起"
looked at me and you said, "I'm sorry."

134
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,140
因为我利用了你
For using you.

135
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:17,260
是的
Yes.

136
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:20,330
要不我为什么会那么说
Why else would I say that?

137
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:24,560
是因为我
This is about me

138
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,300
和我对娜塔莎做的事
and what I did to Natasha.

139
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,320
是我和娜塔莎
It's about me and Natasha

140
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:32,420
还有...
and... and...

141
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,860
还有克里斯
and Chris.

142
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:36,930
我以为你会理解
I thought you'd understand that.

143
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:39,380
我告诉你我理解什么
I'll tell you what I understand.

144
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,500
你养大了你孩子的房子
You raised your child in a house

145
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:48,380
也是你在墙里埋孩子妈妈尸体的地方
with the corpse of their mother buried in the walls.

146
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:51,260
这就是我理解的事
That's what I understand.

147
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,540
-亚当  -不
- Adam... - No.

148
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:01,450
亚当
Adam!

149
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:09,260
能分享一下吗
Able to share anything?

150
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:14,660
我需要跟格里芬警长谈谈
I need to speak to DS Griffin.

151
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,640
好  把吉连带回牢房
Right. Get Killane back to his cell.

152
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:19,300
嗯  格里芬警长在找凯兹
Yeah. DS Griffin wants to know where Katz is.

153
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:24,260
非常感谢
Thank you so much. Thank you so much.

154
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:25,570
认识你很高兴
Good to meet you.

155
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,570
-认识你很高兴  -太好了
- Good to meet you. - Lovely.

156
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,260
-做得好  -谢谢
- Well done. - Thank you.

157
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,980
那两个主教是教会专员
Those two bishops are church commissioners.

158
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:39,100
而且
And...

159
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,800
我觉得他们会在发布前资助应用
I think they're gonna endorse the app in time for the launch.

160
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,800
-那太好了  -天大的好事
- Well, that's wonderful. - Oh, huge.

161
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:48,440
道德投资  人人可为
Ethical investing within everyone's reach.

162
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:50,840
想想看  将本地教堂作为募集点
Imagine, local churches as collection points

163
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:53,500
让最穷的教区居民能分享财富创造
so the poorest parishioner can share in wealth creation.

164
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:55,480
就像关于寡妇力量的寓言
It's the parable of the widow's might,

165
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:57,980
但寡妇既接受也付出
but where the widow receives as well as gives.

166
00:10:58,130 --> 00:10:59,640
简直再好不过
Couldn't be better.

167
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:00,810
凯兹先生
Mr. Katz?

168
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:02,840
-你好  -鲍尔斯太太
- Hello. - Oh, Mrs. Powers.

169
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:04,400
你需要喝杯茶吗
Can I get you a tea or anything?

170
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,680
不了  亲爱的
Uh, no, sweetheart.

171
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,760
不  帕特里克不多待
No, Patrick isn't staying.

172
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:08,930
他就走  但谢谢你了
It's just a flying visit. But thank you.

173
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:12,980
-我就回去  -好
- I'll be right in. - Oh, right.

174
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:14,980
那下次见  凯兹先生
See you next time, Mr. Katz.

175
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,810
见到你很高兴  鲍尔斯太太  保重
It's good to see you, Mrs. Powers. Take care.

176
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:19,810
那么
And...

177
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,320
我的保安主管还带来好消息了吗
is my head of security also the bearer of good news?

178
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:24,170
一切
Is...

179
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,040
都解决了吗
everything resolved?

180
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,260
我还在解决
I'm working on it.

181
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:28,450
什么意思
What do you mean?

182
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:31,080
帕特里克  道德分享不仅是我的公司
Patrick, Ethical Share isn't only a company,

183
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:31,640
还是我的生活
it's my life.

184
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:32,600
我们要发布我的生活了
We're launching my life--

185
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:34,400
鲍尔斯先生  你们公司要支付
Mr. Powers, your company's gonna be paying

186
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,760
我女儿的医疗费
for my daughter's medical care,

187
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:38,040
所以我清楚事关多么重大
so I know how much this matters.

188
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,000
那拜托告诉我你已经完成任务
Then please tell me you've done your job

189
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:41,720
教训过这些勒索者了
and shut these blackmailers down.

190
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:43,100
我给我们争取了时间
I've bought us some time.

191
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:44,620
什么  怎么说
What? How?

192
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:48,810
我从一个失踪老师的教室拿了个钥匙链
I got a key fob from a missing teacher's classroom

193
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:51,450
留给我同事去发现  他们也发现了
and planted it for my colleagues to find, which they did.

194
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:54,140
那大大分散了他们的注意力  但
It's been the perfect diversion. But...

195
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:57,020
你没把一切告诉我  是吧
you didn't tell me the whole story, did you?

196
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,750
这里面是那个妈妈遭勒索的女孩
This details every communication and liaison we had

197
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,810
全部的通讯和联系详情
with that girl whose mother was blackmailed.

198
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,330
谢谢  谢了
Thank you. Ta.

199
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,210
你可不是只见了她一次两次
You didn't just see her once or twice.

200
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:16,330
她见了她34次
You saw her 34 times.

201
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:18,000
他们能通过这个查到我吗
Can they identify me through this?

202
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:19,760
除非我先找到他们  我会的
Not if I get to them first, which I will.

203
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:21,040
但为此  我需要两千
But for that, I need two grand.

204
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,200
干什么  不能留踪迹  我们绝不能有丑闻
For what? Nothing traceable. We can't have any scandal.

205
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:25,680
是为了支付一个银行朋友
No, it's to pay a banking contact

206
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,200
能为我们追踪海蒂·道伊尔的勒索钱
who can track the Heidi Doyle blackmail money for us.

207
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:29,960
然后  等我知道该找谁
Then, as soon as I know who to call on,

208
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:31,320
问题就解决了
the problem is over.

209
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:32,930
什么意思  你要干什么
Why? What will you do?

210
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:36,300
我是个警察
I'm a policeman.

211
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:37,810
他们是勒索犯
They're blackmailers.

212
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:39,660
他们会消失掉的
They'll simply melt away.

213
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,900
吉连怎么说
What did Killane say?

214
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,380
是他妻子  娜塔莎
It's his wife, Natasha.

215
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:01,900
很早以前杀了她
Killed way back.

216
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:04,020
吉连干的吗
By Killane?

217
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:06,420
她要离开他
She was gonna leave him.

218
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:12,380
我看到墙里的尸体时  还以为是柯琳
When I saw the body in the wall, I thought it was Corinne.

219
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:18,720
你妻子的车在机场附近被发现了
Your wife's car has been found up by the airport.

220
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:21,540
我们在监视  看是否有人再去  但...
We're watching it, seeing if anyone returns to it, but...

221
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:25,520
-跟我来  我们去看看  -你确定吗
- Come with me. Let's take a look. - You sure about this?

222
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,380
是的
Yeah.

223
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,690
你接管这里
You take over here.

224
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:30,540
跟我来
Come with me.

225
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,720
那再回奥莉薇娅家吗
So back to Olivia's then, yeah?

226
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:42,900
最好是
I think we should.

227
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,860
她明明在家  她妈却说她在医院
I mean, her mom's saying she's in hospital when she's not.

228
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:48,260
-还扔了那么多药  -和老鼠药
- Chucking out all those medicines. - And rat poison.

229
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:49,880
别忘了老鼠药
Don't forget the rat poison.

230
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:52,690
我们可以巧妙地提一句
We can just slip it in casually, you know?

231
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:54,420
吃了很多药吧
Medicines, yeah.

232
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:57,160
你家现在闹鼠患吗
And do you have a rodent problem at the moment?

233
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:59,480
我只想让你听到奥莉薇娅承认
Look, I just want you to hear Olivia admit

234
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:00,320
是她告诉我
that she's the one who told me

235
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:01,630
是你发了埃拉的照片
you posted the Ella photos,

236
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:04,140
你就知道我为什么要给你的大麻卷下药了  好吗
so then you know why I spiked your joint, okay?

237
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:10,320
妈妈  一小时后回来  好吗
Mom, back in an hour or so, okay?

238
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:11,050
好
Okay.

239
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:13,880
托马斯  你爸叫我给瑞恩做饭
Oh, Thomas, your dad's asked me to feed Ryan,

240
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:15,660
你也回来吃晚饭吗
so if you wanna come back for dinner?

241
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:17,120
嗯  好  谢谢
Yeah, okay, thanks.

242
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:19,020
提醒我永远别坐你的车
Remind me to never get in your car.

243
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:26,620
你没事吧
You all right?

244
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,260
在柯琳
You know, before Corinne...

245
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:32,930
假怀孕之前
faked her pregnancy...

246
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,540
我接了桩案子
I had taken on a case

247
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,540
跟另一位女律师一起
with another lawyer, a woman.

248
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:40,660
然后
And...

249
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,450
我们经常在一起
we spent a lot of time together...

250
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:45,620
你懂的
you know...

251
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:47,420
我们走得很近
got pretty close.

252
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:51,930
我当时没想到  但是...
It didn't occur to me at the time, but...

253
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:54,170
或许柯琳
maybe Corinne...

254
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,480
以为我的心不在家里了
thought that my attention was elsewhere

255
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:58,260
所以她才那么做了
and that's why she did what she did.

256
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:01,740
或许  或许不是
Maybe, maybe not.

257
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,740
谁知道呢
Who knows?

258
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:07,140
听着  我们都
Look, we all...

259
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:10,020
会搞砸关系
mess up relationships.

260
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:14,540
我们并不想伤害我们爱的人
We're not trying to hurt the ones we love.

261
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:17,100
但我们还是会伤害他们
But we do.

262
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:23,500
就在那里  停在了那里
It's up there, that's where it's parked.

263
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:48,450
嗯  那是...
Yeah, that's...

264
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,170
她的车
that's her car.

265
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:52,860
你妻子带护照了吗
Did your wife take her passport with her?

266
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:55,810
应该没有吧
I wouldn't have thought so, no.

267
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,930
你或她  去机场时会停在这里吗
And did you or she ever park here when using the airport?

268
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:01,660
从不
Never.

269
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:03,810
或许她没电了
Maybe she ran out of charge.

270
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:07,260
我们得先看看后备箱
We need to look in the boot first.

271
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,450
我有钥匙  等等
I've got a key. Hang on.

272
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:13,220
好
Okay.

273
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:15,660
抱歉  你得待在这里
I'm sorry, you need to stay there.

274
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,300
真是我见过的最干净的后备箱了
It's the neatest boot I've ever seen.

275
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:31,760
-太棒了  -是你的了
- Oh, it's just lovely. - All yours.

276
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:34,780
-她喜欢的  -好干净啊
- She loves it. - It's so clean.

277
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,220
有什么不寻常的吗
Anything unusual?

278
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:46,780
后座上那个是什么
What's that there on the back seat?

279
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,170
那是柯琳的耳环
Yeah, that's Corinne's earring.

280
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:53,810
我给她买的
Ones that I bought her.

281
00:16:56,770 --> 00:16:57,900
怎么在这里
What's it doing there?

282
00:16:58,450 --> 00:16:59,660
怎么会在这里
Why would it be there?

283
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:02,040
首先  她会戴着这个吗
First things first, would she be wearing them?

284
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,140
是的  她从不摘的  很喜欢
Yes, she never takes them off. She loves them.

285
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:17,850
-亚当  对不起  -拜托  找到她吧
- Adam, look, I'm sorry. I know-- - Please, just find her for me.

286
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,420
好了  奥莉薇娅
Right, Olivia...

287
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:24,050
我需要你告诉迈克你在狂欢上对我说的话
I need you to tell Mike what you told me at the rave.

288
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:25,570
因为他不相信我
'Cause he doesn't believe me.

289
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:26,960
那对我们是个问题
That's a problem for us.

290
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,920
好了  我觉得这样是不行的
Okay. I don't think this is the way to go about this.

291
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,050
只能如此
It's the only way.

292
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,610
奥莉薇娅
Olivia...

293
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:33,980
你当时在找我  是吧
you were looking for me, right?

294
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:36,920
你来找到了我  是吧
You came and found me, yes?

295
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:37,700
黛茜
Daisy?

296
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,540
黛茜
Daisy?

297
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:41,780
什么事
What?

298
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,560
-网上那些埃拉的照片  -那不是埃拉的
- Those Ella photos posted online-- - Yeah, they're not of Ella.

299
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:46,850
我知道  是迈克干的
No, I know. But it was Mike.

300
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:50,800
在学校的储物柜旁  大家都在拿东西
At school, by the lockers, everyone's getting their stuff.

301
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:54,220
他在一旁  拿手机看些恶心的特写色情照片
And he's to the side, looking at these gross close-up porn shots.

302
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:56,480
然后他把手机放进了埃拉包里  就走了
But then he slips it in Ella's bag, walks off.

303
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,540
接着又从自己的兜里拿了手机出来
And now he gets his own phone out of his pocket.

304
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,890
就是迈克  我看到他了
It was Mike. I saw him.

305
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:04,220
你为什么要那么说
Why would you say that?

306
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:06,330
好吧  行了
Okay, that's it.

307
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:08,040
上车去  我们不是来干这个的
Get in the car. We didn't come for this.

308
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:09,840
我是  我们要把事情理清楚
I did. We're sorting things.

309
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:11,570
这并不能理清什么
This doesn't sort anything!

310
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:12,940
回车上去
Get in the car.

311
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:15,850
走吧
Come on.

312
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:17,700
黛茜
Daisy!

313
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,260
不会发生什么坏事的  好吗
Look, nothing bad's gonna happen, okay?

314
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:30,610
我保证
I promise, I give you my word.

315
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:34,020
但我那晚的确那么对黛茜说了
But that is what I said to Daisy that night.

316
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:35,980
而且
And...

317
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,220
我真不该那么说  因为
it was such a terrible thing to say and do because...

318
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,810
是我拿了埃拉的手机发了那些照片
I took Ella's phone and sent those pictures.

319
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,330
是我
It was me.

320
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:49,220
我干的
I did it.

321
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:51,180
都是我干的
All of it.

322
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,500
但为什么
But why?

323
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:54,300
我看到迈克
I saw Mike...

324
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:56,050
跟埃拉说话
talking to Ella.

325
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:57,850
那又如何
Well, even so...

326
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:01,330
我喜欢迈克
I like Mike.

327
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,980
我喜欢他  我就想"他...
I like him and I thought, "Oh, he's...

328
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:06,370
要跟埃拉好了"
gone off with Ella."

329
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:08,540
埃拉才14
Ella-- Ella's 14.

330
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:10,660
但我希望他注意我
But I wanted him to look at me.

331
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,760
他不了解我的感情
He doesn't know what I feel.

332
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:13,720
好吧
Okay, listen--

333
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,700
不  我伤害了好多人
No, I've hurt so many people.

334
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:18,090
现在无法弥补了  怎么能呢
And it can't be put right, how can it?

335
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:20,440
看这时间  我妈要回来了
The time... My mom will be back.

336
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,640
如果你还没走...
And if you're here...

337
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:23,040
-你不能在这里  -好
- You can't be. - Okay.

338
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:24,120
你不能在这里
You can't be here.

339
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:26,420
-我这就走  -你必须走
- Okay, I'm going. - You have to go.

340
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:28,090
但我们得谈谈
But we need to talk.

341
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,850
我不是为这个而来
And I didn't come here for this.

342
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:34,300
我是想来问问你还好吗
I came to see if you were all right.

343
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,080
因为我知道你今早其实在家
'Cause I know you were here this morning

344
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:39,660
虽然你妈说你在医院
when your mom said you were in hospital.

345
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,020
我这就走  好吗
I'm going, okay?

346
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,300
但我说真的
But I mean that.

347
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:45,460
我只想帮你
I just wanna help.

348
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:52,780
我还能告诉你件事
There's something else I can tell you.

349
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:56,900
听着
Look, um...

350
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,620
你记得吗  我说了
Do you remember, I told you

351
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:00,940
那个陌生人身边还有个金发女人
that there was a blond woman with the stranger?

352
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:02,280
她开的车
She was driving the car?

353
00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:04,320
对  她叫英格丽·普利斯比
Right. Well, her name's Ingrid Prisby.

354
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:07,090
英格丽·普利斯比或盖布莉尔·邓巴
Ingrid Prisby or Gabrielle Dunbar.

355
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:09,800
吉连追踪她到温莎锁商务园
Killane tracked her to Windsor Lock Business Park.

356
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:12,500
她是个私家侦探
She's a... private investigator.

357
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,600
我也在那里看到了她  但她开车甩掉了我
And I saw her there, but she... she drove off and I lost her.

358
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:16,610
我只知道这些了
That's all I know.

359
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,900
马丁·吉连帮了你吗
Martin Killane helped you?

360
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:21,500
在此之前  只有他在帮我
He's the only one that's been helping me until now.

361
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,700
找到那陌生人怎么就能找到你妻子了
So how will getting to the stranger help find your wife?

362
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:28,850
一切因她而起
All of this started with her.

363
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:31,370
我觉得她还知道更多事
I think she knows more.

364
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:32,980
她肯定知道
She has to.

365
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,180
我会查的
I'll look into it.

366
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:38,220
谢谢
Thanks.

367
00:20:57,810 --> 00:20:59,000
-喂  -韦斯
- Hello? - Wes.

368
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:00,180
喂  乔
Hello, Jo.

369
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,540
我能拿走吗
Can I take it?

370
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,850
柯琳·普莱斯的钥匙链
The Corinne Price key fob...

371
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:13,460
在海蒂·道伊尔凶案现场发现的那个
found at the Heidi Doyle crime scene...

372
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,420
是谁发现的
who found it?

373
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:17,940
为什么没登记
And why isn't it logged?

374
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:22,570
各位
Hello?!

375
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:27,980
亚当·普莱斯的妻子没拿走护照
Adam Price's wife didn't take her passport.

376
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:35,810
怎么了
What's happened?

377
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,540
柯琳的车被找到了
They found Corinne's car.

378
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:42,940
后座上还有一只她的耳环
And one of her earrings was in the back seat.

379
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:49,130
谢谢你照顾瑞恩
Thanks for having Ryan.

380
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:52,240
家里一窝人呢  托马斯也在
It's a full house. Thomas is here too.

381
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:53,720
进来吧
Come inside. Come inside.

382
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:54,460
谢谢
Thanks.

383
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:57,130
迈克应该会很...
I think that Mike is gonna be pretty...

384
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:02,160
瑞恩真棒
Ryan's been brilliant.

385
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:04,260
我们正要开饭  怎么样
We're about to eat. How's that?

386
00:23:07,370 --> 00:23:08,810
嗯  那太好了
Yeah, sounds great, actually.

387
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:11,940
我想知道的是
What I was wondering is...

388
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:14,960
你们是否见过这个
if either of you have seen this before.

389
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,500
就是在地板上这里发现的
It was found on the floor in this area.

390
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:20,220
没有  我扫过这里的地  有我会看到的
No. I swept up in here. I'd have seen that.

391
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:21,900
抱歉
Sorry.

392
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,330
没事
No, no worries.

393
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,810
那么她被杀前
What about the days...

394
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,160
那几天里呢
leading up to her murder?

395
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,260
你们是否注意到任何异常
Did you notice anything unusual?

396
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:31,220
最后那晚海蒂看上去如何
How was Heidi that last night?

397
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:34,180
精神很好
In great spirits.

398
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:37,050
她当时好像在跟她丈夫打电话
I think she was on the phone to her husband and,

399
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:38,540
她笑得很开心
you know, she was laughing. And...

400
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,020
你知道的
you know...

401
00:23:40,530 --> 00:23:41,740
之前那晚呢
And the night before?

402
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:43,850
我们在给你做蛋糕
We were making your cake.

403
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,050
蛋糕  是啊
Cake, of course.

404
00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:49,740
她看上去不像在担心什么吗
She didn't seem concerned about anything?

405
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,610
也没提有什么钱的问题
No mention of money worries?

406
00:23:55,290 --> 00:23:57,850
她是否提到她第二天要去见女儿
Did she say she was gonna see her daughter the next day?

407
00:23:58,090 --> 00:23:59,940
金柏莉吗  没
Kimberley? No.

408
00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:02,220
她整晚上都有说有笑的
She spent the whole evening laughing and joking.

409
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,540
对  在停车场里跟那俩女人也是
Yeah. Even in the car park with those two women.

410
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:05,980
对  没错
Yeah, that's right. Yeah.

411
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:08,220
什么女人  什么停车场  什么时候
What women? What car park? When?

412
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,260
她就停在这里
She was parked here.

413
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:14,090
那俩女人就在这里
And the two women were here.

414
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,940
我们在那边
We were over there.

415
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,050
还有...
And...

416
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:24,040
-老板  -韦斯  兰顿街停车场
- Hello, boss. - Wes, Renton Street car park.

417
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:25,720
兰顿街停车场
So Renton Street car park?

418
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:28,980
我需要他们监控的录像
I need the footage from their CCTV cameras.

419
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:31,850
-什么时候的  -海蒂·道伊尔被杀前晚

421
00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:36,240
找什么
Looking for what?

422
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:38,300
两个女人  跟海蒂·道伊尔搭话
Two women meeting Heidi Doyle.

423
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:39,810
好  我就办
Okay, I'm on it.

424
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,900
那是市议会的停车场吧
It's a council car park, isn't it?

425
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,020
对
Uh, yeah.

426
00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:46,900
你不是刚要下班吗
Weren't you just clocking off?

427
00:24:47,330 --> 00:24:48,400
没事
Oh, you're okay.

428
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,420
我想帮忙
I wanna help.

429
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,810
你好  雪松田市议会
Hello, Cedarfield Council.

430
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:05,900
好了  瑞恩
All right, Ryan,

431
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,570
直接上床去  都11:30了
straight to bed, it's half eleven.

432
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:09,870
我还没做作业呢
I haven't done my homework.

433
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:11,180
没事  我给你写个条
It's all right, I'll write a note.

434
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:14,320
爸爸  我有一堆作业呢
Dad, I've got loads of homework.

435
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:15,570
我有一堆字条呢
I've got loads of notes.

436
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:24,900
给
Here you go.

437
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:27,780
该死的
Bloody hell.

438
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,330
如果你想  我们可以轮班
Listen, we can do this in shifts, if you like.

439
00:25:31,770 --> 00:25:33,240
一人一小时
Hour on, hour off.

440
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:34,460
-真的吗  -嗯
- Yeah? - Yeah.

441
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,740
反正我喝足了咖啡因  你去休息吧
I'm all caffeined up anyway so go, get your head down.

442
00:25:39,650 --> 00:25:41,140
我一小时后叫醒你
I'll wake you up in an hour, yeah?

443
00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:43,460
你太棒了
Legend.

444
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:09,440
行了  伙计  睡觉了  太晚了
Come on, mate, it's bedtime. It's late.

445
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,640
我知道  但我能跟你谈谈吗
Yeah. I know. But can I talk you about something?

446
00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:14,300
当然  说吧
Yeah, of course, anything.

447
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,330
好
Okay.

448
00:26:21,810 --> 00:26:23,740
-妈妈是跟人跑了吗  -什么
- Has Mom gone off with someone? - What?

449
00:26:24,010 --> 00:26:25,740
你说什么呢  不是
What are you talking about? No.

450
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:27,900
但大部分婚姻不都是因此破裂的吗
But isn't that why most marriages break up?

451
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:30,160
我知道还有其他因素
I mean, I know it's lots of other things as well,

452
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,180
但最终都是这样  是吧
but that's what happens in the end, right?

453
00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:34,440
人们会出轨  然后认真了起来
People have affairs and then it gets serious.

454
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,080
你妈妈没在出轨
Your mom is not having an affair.

455
00:26:36,090 --> 00:26:37,900
人们往往不知道  是吧
People often don't know, do they?

456
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,540
或许是那个教师大会的什么人呢
I mean, maybe it was someone at that teachers' conference.

457
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:41,570
不是
No.

458
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,900
你妈妈绝不会那么做的
Your mom would never do that, ever.

459
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:46,980
-永远不会  -爸爸
- As in ever. - Dad.

460
00:26:47,290 --> 00:26:49,660
这种事时有发生
It happens all the time.

461
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,700
你以为黛茜的爸妈为什么分手了
Why do you think Daisy's mom and dad split up?

462
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:54,120
他跟人跑了
He went off with someone

463
00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:56,940
我觉得现在也是这样
and I just think that's what's happening here.

464
00:26:58,130 --> 00:26:59,980
我觉得妈妈是跟人跑了
I think Mom's gone off with someone else.

465
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,140
你现在在哪
Where are you right now?

466
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,700
质量太差
It's really crap quality.

467
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:44,850
那试试面部识别
Let's try some facial recognition then.

468
00:27:45,890 --> 00:27:47,220
识别什么
To recognize what?

469
00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:49,740
根本看不清脸
Can't make out their faces. It's...

470
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:51,980
像素太低
It's too grainy.

471
00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:54,050
我们什么都查了
We went through everything.

472
00:27:55,290 --> 00:27:57,140
我们可以分析肢体语言
We can read the body language though.

473
00:27:58,650 --> 00:27:59,940
是怎么了
What is it?

474
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:03,740
她们告诉你什么了
What did they just tell you?

475
00:28:07,570 --> 00:28:09,460
好  我们得找到这俩女人
Right, we need to find these two women.

476
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:13,370
其中一个可能是英格丽·普利斯比
One of them could be Ingrid Prisby.

477
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,360
好  我去跟进一下
All right, I'll go follow up

478
00:28:15,370 --> 00:28:17,260
温莎锁商务园
at Windsor Lock Business Park.

479
00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:19,570
好  但然后你要去睡觉
Okay, but then you get some sleep.

480
00:28:23,090 --> 00:28:24,180
我能做什么
What can I do?

481
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:26,020
去睡个觉
Go and get some sleep.

482
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:27,980
我没事
I feel fine.

483
00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:39,520
这是你妈被杀前一晚
This is the night before your mom died.

484
00:28:39,530 --> 00:28:44,300
下班后  她走到车边  碰到了这俩女人
After work, she goes to her car and she meets these two women.

485
00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:46,610
你认得她们吗
Do you recognize them?

486
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:49,980
然后发生了这个
Then this happens.

487
00:28:50,850 --> 00:28:54,700
她们递给了她什么  她的腿都软了
They hand her something and it's like her knees go.

488
00:28:55,810 --> 00:28:59,330
似乎是在对她们给她看的东西做出反应
Like a reaction to something she's been shown.

489
00:29:09,650 --> 00:29:11,810
是为了避免吵到我爸  他一直在失眠
Um, that's for my dad, 'cause he hasn't been sleeping.

490
00:29:18,850 --> 00:29:19,940
天啊
Oh, my God.

491
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:26,420
妈妈那天去见我  是因为
Mom came to see me that day because...

492
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,740
有些人
some people...

493
00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:32,500
那些人吧
Uh, those people, I guess...

494
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:36,460
她们拦下了她  给她看了证据  我在...
they stopped her and gave her proof that I was...

495
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,140
我在为一家
I've been working for this...

496
00:29:42,050 --> 00:29:43,540
甜心网站工作
Sugar Baby site.

497
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,500
是个网站
It's an online thing...

498
00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:48,540
给商人用的
for businessmen.

499
00:29:51,530 --> 00:29:54,740
有时只是跟他们去吃饭  但...
Um, sometimes it's just going out for dinner with them, but...

500
00:29:56,530 --> 00:29:57,420
一般来说
usually...

501
00:30:00,890 --> 00:30:02,260
都是做爱
yeah, it's for sex.

502
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:06,200
这些找上妈妈的人
And these... these people that spoke to Mom,

503
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,420
她们什么都知道
they knew everything.

504
00:30:07,610 --> 00:30:10,400
她们知道我在固定地见三个人
They knew I was seeing three men on a regular basis,

505
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,240
她们还有我们的短信
they had all our texts,

506
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:14,140
她们知道我们都在哪  什么时候见面
they knew when and where we met, and...

507
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:16,460
她们勒索了海蒂
And they were blackmailing Heidi?

508
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:20,050
要一万英镑
For £10,000.

509
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:23,080
但她...应该付钱了
But I think... I think she paid it.

510
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:26,420
所以那晚之后发生的事  应该跟这个无关吧
So whatever happened later that night, that's separate, isn't it?

511
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:29,460
你见的这三个男人
These three men you were seeing...

512
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,280
我见过妈妈之后
Uh, I contacted them

513
00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:33,780
马上联系了他们  说我不干了
as soon as I'd seen Mom to say I was stopping.

514
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,610
我需要他们的联系方式
I'm gonna need their details.

515
00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:39,600
我们都是在应用上联系的
We only messaged via the app.

516
00:30:39,610 --> 00:30:41,810
我并不知道他们的名字和号码
I don't have names or phone numbers.

517
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,660
我们只有网名
We just have tags.

518
00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:47,810
塔兹  甘达  马贝克40  我是凯蒂
Taz, Gander, Malbec40. I'm Kitty.

519
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:50,780
你联系他们时
And when you contacted them?

520
00:30:51,090 --> 00:30:54,000
两个人回复了  很担忧
Two replied, really concerned,

521
00:30:54,010 --> 00:30:56,140
说我如果需要帮助会帮我
offering help if I needed it.

522
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,330
第三个呢
And the third one?

523
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:00,420
他没回复
He didn't reply.

524
00:31:01,330 --> 00:31:04,500
我跟他发了两次消息  因为我们那晚本该见面
I messaged him twice because we were meeting that night and...

525
00:31:04,850 --> 00:31:08,220
我去了  以为他没收到消息  但
I went, thinking he hasn't got the message, but...

526
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,180
他没去
he didn't show.

527
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:15,300
好  我需要你跟我去警局
All right, listen, I'm gonna need you to come in with me.

528
00:31:17,530 --> 00:31:19,700
-抱歉  伊恩  我们吵醒你了吗  -没有
- Sorry, Ian, did we wake you? - No, no, no.

529
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:21,280
有什么消息吗
Is there news?

530
00:31:21,290 --> 00:31:24,370
还没有  但我们在夜以继日了
No, nothing yet. We are working day and night though.

531
00:31:24,530 --> 00:31:25,420
我知道
I know.

532
00:31:36,090 --> 00:31:38,360
-查到了什么  -亚当·普莱斯提供的
- What have you got? - So this lead from Adam Price

533
00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:39,980
温莎锁商务园的线索
at Windsor Lock Business Park...

534
00:31:40,090 --> 00:31:41,740
那个私家侦探社
The detective agency...

535
00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:43,840
-英格丽  -英格丽·普利斯比
- Ingrid... - Ingrid Prisby.

536
00:31:43,850 --> 00:31:45,460
假名为盖布莉尔·邓巴
Alias, Gabrielle Dunbar.

537
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:47,740
她的办公室已经清空了
So her office has been cleared out.

538
00:31:48,370 --> 00:31:49,520
我在查侦探社
I've checked into the agency,

539
00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:51,160
但是用离岸账户设立的
but it was set up with an offshore account

540
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:53,840
所使用的身份并没有任何相关银行账户
so the ID used isn't attached to any sort of bank account

541
00:31:53,850 --> 00:31:55,120
或社会保险号码
or National Insurance number.

542
00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:57,050
就好像根本没存在过咯
So it's as if it never existed.

543
00:31:57,090 --> 00:31:58,050
是啊
Exactly.

544
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:00,900
-好  谢谢  -回见
- Right. Thanks. - See you later.

545
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:07,700
你见的那三个男人
You know the three men you were seeing?

546
00:32:09,650 --> 00:32:12,020
你愿意再联系他们一次吗
How would you feel about contacting them again?

547
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,260
其中一个
One of them...

548
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:18,260
或许能带我们找到勒索你妈妈的那两个女人
might be able to lead us to the two women who met your mom.

549
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:24,220
你觉得勒索者跟我妈的死有关吗
You think the blackmail's linked to Mom's death?

550
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,610
差不多绝对有
Almost certainly.

551
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:34,540
联系他们说什么
Contact them and say what?

552
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:38,050
就要求见面
Ask to meet.

553
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:41,460
先是那个没回复的
Starting with the one who didn't reply.

554
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,570
-马贝克40  -对
- Malbec40. - Yeah.

555
00:32:43,890 --> 00:32:45,300
你觉得他会来吗
Do you think he'll show up?

556
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:48,260
有件事...
There was this...

557
00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:49,980
他...
thing he...

558
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:54,020
总缠着我跟他做
he always pesters me to do with him.

559
00:32:55,290 --> 00:32:56,740
我一直没答应
Which I don't give in to.

560
00:33:00,130 --> 00:33:01,380
我可以说要跟他做那个
I could offer him that.

561
00:33:07,130 --> 00:33:09,090
会一直有人保护你的
You'll be protected at all times.

562
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:14,740
好  我们做吧
Yes, do it.

563
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:18,570
好
Yeah.

564
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,920
-祝你今天顺利  亲爱的  -嗯
- Have a good day, darling. - Yes.

565
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:33,810
回见
See you later.

566
00:33:52,810 --> 00:33:54,980
我是帕特里克·凯兹  我会尽快回电
This is Patrick Katz, I'll call you straight back.

567
00:34:14,090 --> 00:34:15,180
答应他
Accept.

568
00:34:17,970 --> 00:34:18,970
迈克
Mike?

569
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,370
迈克
Mike...

570
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:32,620
迈克  你能听到吗
Mike, can you hear me?

571
00:34:34,450 --> 00:34:35,540
停下了吗
Has it stopped?

572
00:34:37,050 --> 00:34:38,220
我想是的
I think so.

573
00:34:39,490 --> 00:34:40,890
没那么频繁了
It's happening less.

574
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:42,450
但时不时的
But every so often...

575
00:34:44,970 --> 00:34:46,890
我又回到了嗑迷幻药时的那种状态
...I'm back in PCP land.

576
00:34:47,410 --> 00:34:49,540
回忆起了那晚的事
Remembering things from that night,

577
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,140
我忘记的事
things I'd forgotten.

578
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:55,100
比如杀那只羊驼
Like killing the alpaca.

579
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,580
我都嗨傻了
I was off my face.

580
00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:04,680
起初  我和羊驼
To begin with, me and the alpaca,

581
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:05,970
我们是朋友
we were friends.

582
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,480
好朋友
Big pals, amigos,

583
00:35:08,490 --> 00:35:10,220
我们去冒险来着
we're going on an adventure.

584
00:35:13,410 --> 00:35:14,540
但然后...
But then...

585
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,880
我突然觉得  它要吃了我
I suddenly think it's going to eat me.

586
00:35:16,890 --> 00:35:19,620
真的要吃我
I mean, really eat me.

587
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:22,930
它对我咄咄逼人
It's looming over me...

588
00:35:23,930 --> 00:35:25,410
露出牙齿
with these teeth.

589
00:35:27,890 --> 00:35:29,060
然后就结束了
And it's the end.

590
00:35:32,410 --> 00:35:35,330
我拼命地挥动着
And I just swing the shovel

591
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:37,220
铲子
as hard as I can.

592
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:44,260
你不记得其他的了
You don't remember anything else?

593
00:35:45,090 --> 00:35:45,930
不记得了
No.

594
00:35:47,410 --> 00:35:49,020
但最让我害怕的是
But what's freaking me out...

595
00:35:49,570 --> 00:35:52,020
但丁那晚也受伤了
is Dante was hurt that night as well.

596
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:53,970
他现在陷入了昏迷
He's in a coma...

597
00:35:54,410 --> 00:35:57,620
我完全不记得跟他相关的任何事
and I have zero recall for anything to do with him.

598
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:02,370
我对但丁最后的记忆是
The last Dante memory I have is...

599
00:36:03,450 --> 00:36:04,580
你和他
you and him...

600
00:36:04,970 --> 00:36:06,410
去林子里了
going off into the woods.

601
00:36:08,490 --> 00:36:09,850
之后发生了什么
What happened after that?

602
00:36:10,450 --> 00:36:11,620
你们去了哪
Where did you go?

603
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:13,890
你最后见到他是什么时候
When was the last time you saw him?

604
00:36:14,010 --> 00:36:14,890
黛茜
Daisy?

605
00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:16,060
太好了
Oh, great.

606
00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:18,040
我知道你们还在气奥莉薇娅
Look, I know you're still angry with Olivia,

607
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:19,400
但她要我稍后去见她
but she's asked to see me later.

608
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:21,140
我想跟她谈谈
And I thought I should talk to her,

609
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,800
-我们先按兵不动  -好
- before anyone says anything. - Yeah, sure.

610
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:24,490
去吧
Do it.

611
00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:27,930
她是同意了我的话吗
Did she just agree to that?

612
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:29,930
嗯
Yeah.

613
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,370
我觉得是的
I think she did.

614
00:36:43,490 --> 00:36:44,660
醒醒了
Wakey! Wakey!

615
00:36:45,050 --> 00:36:46,410
来吧  找我们呢
Come on, we're wanted.

616
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,810
-干什么  -叫我们回去上班
- What for? - We've been called back in.

617
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:53,100
天啊
Oh, God.

618
00:36:53,610 --> 00:36:55,400
-我手机没电了  -嗯
- My phone's out of charge. - Yeah.

619
00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:56,180
该死
Fuck!

620
00:36:56,410 --> 00:36:57,450
给你我的充电器
Have my charger.

621
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,810
-谢谢  -快点的吧
- Thanks. - Get a move on.

622
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,300
该死的
Fucking hell.

623
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,810
大家能不能安静下来
Okay, can everyone settle down, please?

624
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:07,330
我们的睡美人们  能不能快点
And our sleeping beauties, can you speed it up?

625
00:37:08,610 --> 00:37:12,360
好  找个甜心.com
Okay, FindYourSugarBaby.Com

626
00:37:12,370 --> 00:37:14,040
是一个性爱网站
is a sex site

627
00:37:14,050 --> 00:37:16,520
帮商人和年轻女子牵线
matching businessman with young women.

628
00:37:16,530 --> 00:37:19,140
基本上就是卖淫
It's essentially prostitution.

629
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:21,320
为了海蒂·道伊尔案
And in connection with the Heidi Doyle murder,

630
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:23,640
我们要追查一名未知男子
we are after an unknown man

631
00:37:23,650 --> 00:37:26,060
他已安排好在波利塔酒店
who has arranged to meet this woman

632
00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:28,330
见这名女子
at the Bolitar Hotel.

633
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:30,810
行动很简单
Straightforward op.

634
00:37:30,850 --> 00:37:33,880
主要目标  保护我们的线人
Main priority: protect our source.

635
00:37:33,890 --> 00:37:35,580
跟海蒂·道伊尔有什么联系
Connected to Heidi Doyle how?

636
00:37:36,570 --> 00:37:39,080
海蒂·道伊尔被勒索了
Heidi Doyle was blackmailed

637
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:40,840
一万英镑
to the tune of £10,000

638
00:37:40,850 --> 00:37:44,370
跟这个找个甜心网站有关
in connection with this FindYourSugarBaby site.

639
00:37:44,890 --> 00:37:48,410
这是海蒂的女儿
And this is Heidi's daughter.

640
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:53,000
波利塔酒店很受商人的欢迎
Now, the Bolitar Hotel is very popular with businessmen.

641
00:37:53,010 --> 00:37:55,560
我们的目标  40出头
So our target, early 40s,

642
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:57,200
身材中等  利索的黑发
medium build, smart dark hair,

643
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,520
这样的人肯定很多
is hardly gonna stick out.

644
00:37:58,530 --> 00:38:01,800
他走到线人身边之前估计不会被认出来
He probably won't be identified until he reaches our source.

645
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,120
但要知道这点
Know this about him though:

646
00:38:03,130 --> 00:38:06,180
他用马贝克40这个网名
he uses the tag Malbec40,

647
00:38:06,490 --> 00:38:09,480
网络组追踪这个网名
a tag that the cyber team have been tracking

648
00:38:09,490 --> 00:38:12,410
两年了  因为涉及投资欺诈
for two years over investment scams.

649
00:38:12,530 --> 00:38:15,890
好  各位在酒店的初始位置
Right, your start positions in the hotel...

650
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,370
这太扯了
This is bullshit.

651
00:38:17,450 --> 00:38:19,360
1号桌是本和尼尔
So table one, I've got Ben and Neil.

652
00:38:19,370 --> 00:38:21,660
就像她一个人跟亚当·普莱斯
It's like her going off with Adam Price,

653
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:24,850
我们头号嫌犯的丈夫  开车来去
husband of our main suspect, on her own.

654
00:38:25,650 --> 00:38:27,400
简直难以置信
It's un-fucking-believable.

655
00:38:27,410 --> 00:38:31,180
凯兹和韦斯  你们是3号桌
Katz and Wes, you're at table three.

656
00:38:32,130 --> 00:38:34,920
所以说你不能调查朋友的凶杀案
This is why you don't investigate the murder of friends.

657
00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:36,240
5号桌  蒂姆和萨尔
Table five, Tim and Sal,

658
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:38,240
6号桌  夏洛特和泰德
Table six, Charlotte and Ted.

659
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,780
好  大家都清楚任务了吧
Right, we all know what we're doing?

660
00:38:40,050 --> 00:38:41,970
很好  非常感谢  各位
Great. Thanks very much, everybody.

661
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,810
我是拉里·鲍尔斯  请留言  我稍后回电
Hi, this is Larry Powers. Leave a message and I'll call you back.

662
00:39:19,530 --> 00:39:20,850
别玩手机了  好吗
Get off your phone, will you?

663
00:39:22,050 --> 00:39:23,180
我是在融入环境
I'm fitting in.

664
00:39:25,650 --> 00:39:26,700
你在干什么
What are you doing?

665
00:39:53,530 --> 00:39:54,960
再给我们拿杯酒  好吗
Get us another drink, will you?

666
00:39:54,970 --> 00:39:57,040
-这次拿杯好的  -我们在执勤
- Proper one this time. - We're on duty.

667
00:39:57,050 --> 00:39:58,180
对  在酒吧执勤
Yeah, in a bar.

668
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:01,330
目标还有多久来
When is the target due?

669
00:40:02,490 --> 00:40:03,500
五分钟
Five minutes.

670
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,330
我去要
I'll get one.

671
00:40:12,570 --> 00:40:13,560
两杯双份伏特加
Two double vodkas.

672
00:40:13,570 --> 00:40:14,810
-加冰和柠檬吗  -不
- Ice and lemon? - No.

673
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:39,930
该死
Fuck.

674
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:46,780
刀  有刀
Knife! Knife!

675
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:48,740
别拘捕
Do not resist!

676
00:40:49,370 --> 00:40:50,000
闭嘴
Shut up!

677
00:40:50,010 --> 00:40:51,020
放开我
Get off me!

678
00:40:51,370 --> 00:40:52,410
干什么
What is this?!

679
00:40:53,530 --> 00:40:54,540
放开我
Get off me!

680
00:40:56,610 --> 00:40:57,700
你在干什么
What are you doing?

681
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,280
放开我  放开
Get off of me! Get off!

682
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,130
-不  -不吗
- No. - No?

683
00:41:03,130 --> 00:41:04,140
不是他
No, isn't him.

684
00:41:05,050 --> 00:41:06,000
我以为我看到了刀
I thought I saw a knife.

685
00:41:06,010 --> 00:41:07,180
什么都没有
There's nothing!

686
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:09,300
-我以为他有刀  -滚出我的视线
- I thought he had a knife. - Just get out of my sight!

687
00:41:09,490 --> 00:41:11,760
不  算了  你被撤掉了
No, no, actually no. Stand down.

688
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,280
你回家去  明天也别来了
I'm sending you home, don't come in tomorrow.

689
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,080
乔
Jo--

690
00:41:14,090 --> 00:41:15,450
别喊我乔
Don't call me Jo!

691
00:41:16,490 --> 00:41:18,260
你真得退一步了
You need to step back from this, seriously.

692
00:41:19,130 --> 00:41:20,970
他只是尽了职
He's just done what any of us would've done.

693
00:41:21,410 --> 00:41:23,140
你对这事太动感情了
This is too personal for you.

694
00:41:23,570 --> 00:41:26,410
你再也不要不接我的电话了
Don't you ever, ever have your phone turned off to me.

695
00:41:26,490 --> 00:41:27,600
你以为你在跟谁说话呢
Who do you think you're talking to?

696
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:28,560
-你什么意思  -闭嘴
- What do you mean-- - Shut up.

697
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:29,930
闭嘴  听好
Shut up and listen.

698
00:41:30,890 --> 00:41:33,660
我想通过银行追踪的勒索犯
The blackmailers I was trying to track through the bank....

699
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,060
我的人没能追踪到他们
My contact couldn't trace them.

700
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:37,840
我们现在怎么办
So what do we do now?

701
00:41:37,850 --> 00:41:39,140
我另想办法
I'll find another way.

702
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:42,410
我们收工吧
Let's wrap this up.

703
00:41:44,570 --> 00:41:45,920
但丁·甘纳森刚醒了
Dante Gunnarsson's just come round.

704
00:41:45,930 --> 00:41:47,410
-我去吧  -我没事
- Let me go. I can-- - I'm fine.

705
00:41:52,370 --> 00:41:53,410
好吧
All right!

706
00:41:54,610 --> 00:41:56,060
好  好
All right! All right!

707
00:41:58,450 --> 00:42:00,620
不动吉连家  我理解
Leaving Killane's house, I understand.

708
00:42:01,130 --> 00:42:04,300
周边房子  也行  但整个工地
The surrounding houses, okay, but the whole fucking site?!

709
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,360
停止一切拆除
Stopping any demolition?!

710
00:42:07,370 --> 00:42:09,880
这让我损失重大  他们根本不知道
This is costing me a fortune. They have no idea.

711
00:42:09,890 --> 00:42:12,440
我又不是什么外人
It's not like I'm some kind of an outsider or something.

712
00:42:12,450 --> 00:42:13,880
这是我的街道
This was my street.

713
00:42:13,890 --> 00:42:16,520
吉连夫妇曾是我的朋友  曾经也是好朋友
The Killanes were friends. They were good friends once.

714
00:42:16,530 --> 00:42:17,960
所以  表示尊重
So, due respect,

715
00:42:17,970 --> 00:42:19,680
我是最能理解的
I understand better than anyone here,

716
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,600
但也不能停止整个施工
but you don't close down the whole operation!

717
00:42:21,610 --> 00:42:22,810
我需要跟你谈谈
I need to talk to you.

718
00:42:22,850 --> 00:42:24,850
就是报复  太武断了
Vindictive! It was arbitrary!

719
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:27,580
那个负责的女警
That police woman in charge...

720
00:42:28,010 --> 00:42:31,040
态度傲慢  我见过太多次了
There's an attitude. I've seen it so many times before!

721
00:42:31,050 --> 00:42:31,840
真的
I kid you not,

722
00:42:31,850 --> 00:42:34,120
他们就是不放过任何让你难受的机会
they will take any opportunity to kick you where it hurts.

723
00:42:34,130 --> 00:42:35,500
-柯琳失踪了  -什么
- Corinne's missing. - What?

724
00:42:35,650 --> 00:42:37,100
柯琳失踪了
I said Corinne's missing.

725
00:42:38,090 --> 00:42:39,300
她不见了
She's gone. She...

726
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,880
她已经消失六天了  我不知道她在哪
She's been gone for about six days. I don't know where she is.

727
00:42:41,890 --> 00:42:43,810
-你怎么没说  -我这不说了
- Why didn't you say? - I'm saying it now.

728
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:46,850
-好吧  -我需要问你件事
- Okay. - Look, I need to ask you something.

729
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:49,320
我并不知道推动此事的公司是你的
I didn't know you owned the company behind all of this,

730
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:51,370
-但你说吉连知道  -是的  我都说了
- but you think Killane did, right? - Yeah, I said so.

731
00:42:51,970 --> 00:42:53,700
你觉得那是他雇我的原因吗
Do you think that's why he hired me,

732
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,840
因为他以为那能阻止你
because he thought it might stop you?

733
00:42:55,850 --> 00:42:57,970
是的  可能的
Yeah, it's feasible.

734
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,320
但那跟柯琳有什么关系
But what would that have to do with Corinne?

735
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:01,930
或许他还绑架了她
Maybe he got to her too.

736
00:43:02,930 --> 00:43:03,930
他...
He was...

737
00:43:04,650 --> 00:43:06,100
之前在帮我找她
helping me look for her.

738
00:43:07,490 --> 00:43:08,880
一直跟我扯什么
Kept spouting all this bullshit

739
00:43:08,890 --> 00:43:10,920
有些女人走了就不回来了
about sometimes women leave and they don't come back,

740
00:43:10,930 --> 00:43:12,700
结果一直以来  他自己的老婆...
and all the time his own wife was...

741
00:43:15,530 --> 00:43:17,410
他还骗了我什么
What else has he been lying to me about?

742
00:43:18,130 --> 00:43:19,400
我觉得他知道什么关于柯琳的事
I think he knows something about Corinne

743
00:43:19,410 --> 00:43:20,520
没有告诉我
that he's not telling me.

744
00:43:20,530 --> 00:43:21,520
我们得找他谈
We have to talk to him.

745
00:43:21,530 --> 00:43:22,450
我知道
I know.

746
00:43:24,010 --> 00:43:24,850
警探
Detective.

747
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:28,410
怎么  发生什么了
Why? What's happened?

748
00:43:31,050 --> 00:43:32,180
哪家医院
Which hospital?

749
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:35,180
怎么...
What...?

750
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:37,180
怎么了
What's happened?

751
00:43:37,410 --> 00:43:39,500
马丁·吉连刚刚自杀未遂
Martin Killane just tried to commit suicide.

752
00:43:40,410 --> 00:43:41,410
我得走了
I've gotta go.

753
00:44:11,850 --> 00:44:13,280
先生  你不能进来
Sir, you're not allowed here.

754
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:15,600
我得找他问问我妻子的事  他之前在帮我
I just need to talk to him about my wife. He was helping me.

755
00:44:15,610 --> 00:44:16,780
他被打了麻药
He's sedated.

756
00:44:22,050 --> 00:44:23,780
妈妈上晚课
Mom does evening classes.

757
00:44:24,490 --> 00:44:26,020
数学和生物
Maths and biology.

758
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:27,660
她想做个护士
She wants to be a nurse.

759
00:44:28,050 --> 00:44:29,500
我等到她走了才来的
I waited till she went.

760
00:44:30,930 --> 00:44:32,140
你就像你妈妈
You're like your mom.

761
00:44:32,490 --> 00:44:33,450
是吧
Aren't you?

762
00:44:33,650 --> 00:44:35,900
她就担心我经常生病的事
She's been worried about me being ill so often,

763
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:37,660
你也很好心
and you're kind...

764
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:39,220
就像她
like her.

765
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:41,680
她还问我要不要
She even asked if I wanted to see

766
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:43,360
再去找别的医生看看
another doctor for a second opinion.

767
00:44:43,370 --> 00:44:45,890
我妈妈不想那么做
I mean, my mom didn't like that.

768
00:44:46,370 --> 00:44:47,780
我们就没去  但
So we didn't, but...

769
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:49,330
她真是好心
it was nice of her.

770
00:44:51,890 --> 00:44:53,540
你为什么经常生病
Why are you ill so often?

771
00:44:53,930 --> 00:44:55,100
他们不知道
They don't know.

772

但你都在服什么药
But what medication are you on?

773
00:44:57,130 --> 00:44:58,410

00:45:03,010 --> 00:45:05,660
那么是谁在服那么多药  你妈妈吗
Right, so who takes all the medicine around here? Your mom?

777
00:45:06,570 --> 00:45:07,660
我妈妈
My mom?

778
00:45:08,370 --> 00:45:09,260

No.

779

我是想谈埃拉和迈克的事
No, look, I wanted to talk about Ella and Mike.

780
00:45:13,050 --> 00:45:14,580
会说到那个的  但是
We will, but listen...

781
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:18,450
听你妈妈撒谎说你在医院后
After your mom said you were in hospital and you weren't,

782
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:21,540
我们看到她丢掉了大量的处方药盒
we saw her throwing out these boxes of prescription drugs,

783
00:45:21,930 --> 00:45:23,970
还有好多盒老鼠药
and even boxes of rat poison.

784
00:45:24,570 --> 00:45:25,970
而且不是扔在你们自家垃圾箱里
And not in your own bin.

785
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:27,410
什么意思
What do you mean?

786
00:45:29,650 --> 00:45:30,320
肯定是我妈妈
I bet that's my mom.

787
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:32,700
她会回来查我岗  去藏起来
She does this to check on me. Go hide in there, go.

788
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:46,800
爸爸  你怎么来了
Dad, what are you doing here?

789
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:48,100
亲爱的  你好吗
Hi, darling. How are you?

790
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:50,620
我不会久留

-你去哪  -我得开我的车

我很快就要有钱了  好吗
Very soon I'm gonna come into some money, okay?

794
00:46:02,010 --> 00:46:04,500
我会更经常地陪伴你  我保证
And I'm gonna be around a lot more for you, I promise.

796
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:08,850
我保证
I promise you.

797
00:47:16,530 --> 00:47:17,960
我想过去...
I'm trying to get through--

798
00:47:17,970 --> 00:47:20,960
不行  抱歉  这一区暂不接待探病者
No, sorry, this area is currently closed to visitors.

799
00:47:20,970 --> 00:47:23,720
你得回前台的保安处
You'll need to go back down to security at the front desk

800
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:25,100
获得批准
and get authorization.

801
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:26,020
抱歉  亲爱的
Sorry, love.
