1
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:09,410
在橡樹葉剛剛開始變紅的秋天 我們前往格羅夫果園
And at the first blush of the oak leaves, we head to the Grove.

2
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:12,790
唯一的麻煩是 從一地遷徙到另一地要歷經重重危險
The only trouble is there's a hundred perils between here and there.

3
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:15,040
那我就是個危險
I'm peril.

4
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:16,120
住手
-Stop!

5
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:27,250
我們的光 正在消逝
Our light is fading.

6
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:31,080
這個秘銀…這是我們唯一的救贖嗎
And this mithril... It is our only salvation?

7
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:35,250
所以整個精靈族的命運…
So the fate of the entire Elven race...

8
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:36,500
都掌握在你手中
-...is in your hands. -Hmm.

9
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:38,410
戰斗
Nampat!

10
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:41,290
索隆曾經是你們人類的敵人 也是我們精靈的敵人
Sauron was once your people's enemy as much as mine.

11
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,950
我請求您重建 努門諾爾和精靈之間的聯盟
I call on you to reforge the alliance between Númenor and Elves.

12
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:48,040
拯救南方大地的人類
To save the men of the Southlands.

13
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,410
把它交給我
Give it to me.

14
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:52,620
在這下邊
It's under here.

15
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,200
向南方大地真正的國王致敬
All hail to the true King of the Southlands.

16
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:02,370
所有人致敬
All hail!

17
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:09,620
快找掩護
Take shelter!

18
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:10,540
女王
The Queen!

19
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:13,290
希奧
Theo!

20
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:39,330
指環王：力量之戒
第一季第七集

21
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:39,330
本WEB版外掛字幕由  風吹來的那片云  雙語合并

22
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,000
救命
Help!

23
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,410
哈爾布蘭德
Halbrand!

24
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:46,410
埃蘭迪爾
Elendil!

25
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,500
哈爾布蘭德
Halbrand!

26
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:53,410
媽媽
Mother? Mother?

27
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,540
媽媽
Mother!

28
00:04:57,410 --> 00:04:58,660
在這邊
Over here.

29
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,870
過來
Come here.

30
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:10,160
-你受傷了嗎  -沒有
-Are you hurt? -No.

31
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,910
跟我來
Stay with me.

32
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:15,950
過來吧
Come on.

33
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,700
安塔摩去哪了 剛才還和我在一起
Where's Ontamo? Ontamo was with me.

34
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:43,620
爬著走
Crawl.

35
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,200
爬著走 我不會丟下你不管的
Crawl. I won't leave you.

36
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:47,290
士兵 在這邊
Soldier, over here!

37
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,540
維藍迪爾
Valandil.

38
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,410
士兵 他咽氣了
Soldier, he's gone.

39
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:19,410
他咽氣了
He's gone.

40
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
這邊走
This way!

41
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,410
-他咽氣了… -快走吧
-He's gone... -Come on!

42
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,080
求你們救救我們吧
-Help! Please, help! -Soldiers! Over here! We're inside!

43
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:30,790
士兵們 那個屋頂快要塌了
That roof's about to come down.

44
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,500
趕快清出一條路
-Can't get out! -Quickly, clear a path.

45
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:56,000
在這里 這邊走
Over here. This way.

46
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,410
抓緊我的手 你不會有事的
Take hold of my hand. You're all right.

47
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,450
往前走 別走散
Go forward. Stay together.

48
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,040
快點 女王
-Hurry, my Queen.

49
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,120
快走
-Go.

50
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,040
往橋的方向走
Go towards the bridge.

51
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,540
快把他們帶離這里
Get them out of here!

52
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:15,120
不
-No!

53
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:28,040
伊熙爾杜
Isildur! Isildur!

54
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,830
老博爾格巴克去抓蝸牛
Old Bolgerbuck went snailing

55
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,700
在金風玉露的秋日
One autumn day so fine

56
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:36,500
他找到了百只大蝸牛
He found a hundred big ones

57
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:38,500
真希望全都是我的
I wish that they were mine

58
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:39,500
就在前面
Up ahead.

59
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:42,080
格羅夫 我覺得就是這里
The Grove! I think this is it.

60
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,660
這話你三天前就已經說過了
Said that three days ago.

61
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:46,750
不是的 他說得對 我記得這里
No, no, he's right. I remember this.

62
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:48,000
快來吧
Come on.

63
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:52,040
聞到了嗎 是柴火煙  其他毛腳肯定已經開始烘烤了
Do you smell that? Wood smoke! The others must've started bakin'.

64
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:23,160
布羅斯先生
Mr. Burrows.

65
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:25,870
這是怎么回事
What happened?

66
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:32,660
我曾祖父以前 經常說起南方有些山能噴射巖漿
My great-grand used to speak of mountains to the south that could spit fire-rock.

67
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:35,160
他說這些山會休眠
He said they go to sleep.

68
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:38,330
有時會長達數百年
Sometimes for hundreds of years.

69
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:45,950
只有在新的邪惡勢力崛起時 它們才會再次噴發
Only to wake again when a new evil is rising.

70
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,410
白蘭地足
Brandyfoot.

71
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,330
你那位朋友 那個大家伙
Your friend up there. The big fella.

72
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:16,330
-你不覺得… -覺得什么
-You don't suppose... -Suppose what?

73
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:17,910
也許他能解決這個問題
Maybe he could fix it.

74
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,120
-快去啊 諾瑞 -他之前還收拾了那群狼呢
-Go on, Nori. -Yes. Like he fixed those wolves.

75
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,120
-你在等什么  -我不知道…
-Uh, I don't know... I don't know if he... -What you waitin' for?

76
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,620
他已經為我們做了那么多
He's done so much for us.

77
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:27,250
再對他提要求會顯得我們有點無禮
It's a mite rude of us to ask more of him.

78
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:29,790
我明白了
I see.

79
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:33,500
那我去跟他說
-I'll ask him, then.

80
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:35,500
薩道克
Sadoc!

81
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,330
別擋道 小家伙們
Out the way, little ones.

82
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
更新…
á keuta...

83
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:48,750
修復…
á envinyata...

84
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,540
恢復…
Envinyata...

85
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:56,120
開花…
Lót? na...

86
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:59,450
-開花… -他在嘀咕什么
-Lót? na... -What's he mutterin'?

87
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:02,750
估計就是一些 很簡單的詞 好讓大樹能聽懂
Likely little words, so the tree'll understand.

88
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:04,830
薩道克 樹可不會說話
Sadoc, trees don't talk.

89
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:05,950
有些樹是會的
Some do.

90
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:08,290
別讓他分心
Don't distract him.

91
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,120
恢復
Envinyata!

92
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,290
開花
Lót? na!

93
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:21,910
不可思議 居然起作用了…
Great-goats. It's working...

94
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:29,200
活下來
á kuita! á kuita! á kuita!

95
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,120
他在讓大樹起死回生
He's fixin' it.

96
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,120
正如薩道克所說
Just like Sadoc said he would.

97
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,250
迪莉 快回來
Dilly, get back!

98
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,910
-不  -諾瑞
-No! -Nori!

99
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,870
乖女兒們
My sweet girls! My babies!

100
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:50,700
諾瑞 迪莉
Nori! Dilly! Dilly.

101
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:53,580
迪莉 諾瑞 你們沒事吧
Dilly, Nori, are you all right?

102
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:57,040
往那邊走
-There you go.

103
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,700
你沒事吧
Are you all right? Are you all right?

104
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:00,700
我說過了 我沒事
I'm all right. I said.

105
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:02,160
我沒…
-I'm all...

106
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:26,870
我們請求從這座大山獲取神圣的礦石
We ask for something sacred from this mountain.

107
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:31,160
所以作為回報 我們也會提供一些神圣的物品
And so we offer something sacred in return.

108
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:36,200
為了換取你秘銀礦的使用權
In exchange for access to your mithril mines,

109
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:38,750
精靈族準備 連續五個世紀為這座城市供應
the Elves are prepared to furnish this city

110
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:42,290
家具 動物 谷物
with game, grain,

111
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:47,330
以及來自埃利阿多古老森林的木材
and timber from the elder forests of Eriador for the next five centuries.

112
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,080
五個世紀
Five centuries?

113
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:51,700
如果他們說話算數 那這個承諾可不一般…
Quite a promise, if they can keep it...

114
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,620
我向來信守承諾
I never made a promise I didn't.

115
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:59,500
看來你已經學會了幾個石語的詞匯
I see you've learned a few words of stone-tongue.

116
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:01,790
了不起
Impressive.

117
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,950
告訴我 我們為什么要相信精靈
Tell me, why should we trust any Elf?

118
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:10,040
你們不應該相信精靈
You should not.

119
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,750
但可以相信我
But you can trust me.

120
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:18,330
因為我不是普通的精靈 我可是埃爾隆德半精靈
For I am no common Elf, but Elrond Half-elven.

121
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:23,450
我在精靈身上看到了 他們在自己身上看不到的東西
And I see in Elves that which they cannot see in themselves.

122
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:26,700
所以我現在孤身求見…
That is why I stand before you now, alone...

123
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:31,750
懇求您
Pleading.

124
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,790
拯救我的人民
For you to save my people.

125
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:41,750
尊貴的國王 請幫幫我們吧
Please, noble King. Help us.

126
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,750
我要和我兒子說兩句話
I will speak to my son now.

127
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,500
父親 您準備怎么答復
What is to be your answer, Father?

128
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:32,660
據說當年奧力創造我們矮人時
It is said that when Aul? created our people,

129
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:35,870
他用到了兩種元素
he crafted us of two elements.

130
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,500
火與石
Fire and rock.

131
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:44,040
我們體內的石元素渴望永恒
The rock that lives within us hungers for the eternal,

132
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,120
抗拒時間的拉扯
resisting the pull of time.

133
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:51,120
而火元素擁抱真理
But the fire embraces truth.

134
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:56,950
相信萬物總有一天都會消耗殆盡
That all things must one day be consumed...

135
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,000
-然后化作灰塵 -父親…
-...and fade away to ash... -Father...

136
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,750
我們從不挖掘容易塌陷的大地
We do not dig in earth that cannot support it.

137
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:04,290
也從不鉆入黑暗之外的深處
-Delving into depths beyond the darkness.

138
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:09,160
更不會冒上被 陰影 巖石和礦場埋葬山底的風險
Tempting shadow, rock, and mine to bury us all beneath the mountain.

139
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:12,330
所以我不會拿矮人們的生命冒險
I will not risk Dwarven lives

140
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:15,540
去幫助精靈逃避死亡
to help the Elves cheat death.

141
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:17,200
逃避死亡
Cheat death?

142
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:19,830
父親
Father!

143
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,450
我朋友身處險境
My friend is drowning,

144
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:30,580
他現在伸手向我求援
reaching for me to pull him to shore.

145
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:32,830
難道你就因為害怕石頭墜落
You expect me to swat his hand away

146
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:35,160
就讓我甩開他的手坐視不管嗎
because you're afraid of a bloody rock fall?

147
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:38,700
精靈族的命運 早在幾個紀元之前就已經被決定了
The fate of the Elves was decided many Ages ago.

148
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:43,000
那些決定者遠比我們更具智慧
By minds much wiser,

149
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,370
比我們更有遠見
much farther-seeing than our own.

150
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:51,910
如若違抗他們的意志 那我們整個王國都可能會崩塌
Defy their will, and this entire kingdom might fall.

151
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:55,870
甚至整個中洲都會如此
Perhaps the entire Middle-earth.

152
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:09,160
抱歉 兒子
I am sorry, my son.

153
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,540
但精靈族的命數已盡
But their time has come.

154
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:19,080
糟老頭子 冷漠 愚蠢
-Lice-bearded, uncaring, old fool!

155
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:21,040
如果他說得對呢
What if he's right?

156
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,790
你該不會坐視不管吧
You're not thinking of lettin' this happen!

157
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:28,040
我們還有別的選擇嗎
What choice do we have?

158
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:32,160
你說過其他矮人領主 對這項提議持開放態度
You said the other Dwarf-lords were open to the proposal.

159
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:34,830
如果我們自己重新開礦
If we reopen the mine ourselves,

160
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:37,790
向其他領主證明 可以有安全的方法開采秘銀
prove to them there's a safe way to gather mithril,

161
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:39,540
或許能讓你父親聽進去
perhaps they'd make him listen.

162
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:42,620
或許我們可以強迫你父親出手
Perhaps we could force your father's hand.

163
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,830
他可不光是我的父親啊 迪莎
He's more than just my father, Disa.

164
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:49,330
他還是我們的國王
He's our king.

165
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,700
如果我教給孩子們
What kind of father would I be

166
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:55,120
國王的意志可以當做耳旁風
if I teach our children the will of a king

167
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:58,160
那我還算哪門子父親啊
should be counted as dross to be cast to the wind?

168
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:06,540
那好吧
-All right, fine.

169
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:10,540
我剛才不應該說他是個糟老頭子
I shouldn't have said he had lice in his beard.

170
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:14,450
-也不該罵他愚蠢 -是啊
-Or called him a fool. -Yeah.

171
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:15,620
不
No.

172
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:20,040
不 我就是討厭 你對我母親的各種諷刺批評
No, I detest it when you heap slag on my mother.

173
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:24,660
你母親確實是有點糟糕…
Uh, well, in your mother's case, she actually does have lice in her...

174
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,500
我開玩笑的
I'm joking. I'm joking.

175
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:07,000
看來我不能強留你吃晚飯了吧
Don't suppose I can elbow you into staying for dinner?

176
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:10,120
我得向吉爾加拉德報告
Gil-galad must be informed.

177
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:17,580
很快他將不再是國王 因為林頓很快將不復存在了
And soon, he will no longer be a king, for there will no longer be a Lindon.

178
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:26,830
那這就是道別了嗎
So this is goodbye, then?

179
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,620
我們從不道別
We do not say goodbye.

180
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:40,910
-我們會說Namá… -Namári?
-We say namá... -Namári?.

181
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:44,620
含義遠比單純的“告別”更豐富
It means more than simply "farewell."

182
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:51,200
意思是：“愿你向善而行”
It means... "Go towards goodness."

183
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:15,080
埃爾隆德
Elrond!

184
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:29,790
它們為什么要這樣做
Why'd they do this?

185
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:32,950
為了把這里變成它們的家
To make this their home.

186
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:35,700
它們的魔影之地
Their Shadow Land.

187
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,830
那我們就把土地奪回來 把它們趕走
So we take it back, and drive them off.

188
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:41,250
我們位置不利 也沒有增援
We have neither position, nor reinforcement.

189
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:43,500
這片土地完蛋了
These lands are dead.

190
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,620
我們必須把活著的人集結起來
We must rally to the living.

191
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:47,580
或者將敵人一劍封喉
Or put steel down their throats!

192
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:51,040
已經結束了
It is over.

193
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,830
對我而言沒有結束 我也不允許結束
Not for me. I won't allow it!

194
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:54,160
我們必須停手
We must!

195
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:58,910
我們必須停手
We must.

196
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:06,950
你在苦惱什么 這又不是你的錯
What are you so bothered about? It isn't your fault.

197
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,290
是我的錯
Yes, it is.

198
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:24,200
繼續前進 就是這樣
Keep moving. That's it.

199
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:32,790
幫幫后邊的人
Help those people at the back there.

200
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:02,290
伊熙爾杜
Isildur?

201
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:17,080
-女王  -她還活著
-The Queen! -She's alive.

202
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,750
-女王 -她來了
-Is she hurt? -Save us!

203
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:21,700
-她沒事吧  -我還以為我們痛失女王了
-Is she hurt? -Is she all right? Thank goodness!

204
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:27,950
女王
My Queen.

205
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,330
請騎我的馬
Take my horse.

206
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:48,330
船長 你…
Captain, you...

207
00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:53,410
-船長… -他在哪里
-Captain... -Where is he?

208
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:00,500
我兒子在哪里
Where is my son?

209
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:06,450
他們是戰死了嗎
They're dead, aren't they?

210
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:12,330
阿隆迪爾 我的朋友們 我…
Arondir. My friends. My...

211
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:16,540
我母親 所有人
My mother. Everyone.

212
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:22,790
未知的事情 會嚴重影響思緒 我們不能胡亂猜測
What cannot be known hollows the mind. Fill it not with guesswork.

213
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,870
我們還要去哪里
Where are we even going?

214
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:34,330
努門諾爾在那條山脊線上安營扎寨
Númenor set their camp upon that ridgeline,

215
00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:35,830
就在那個遠處的山峰后邊
beyond that far peak.

216
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:39,950
他們應該和其他幸存者都跑去了那里
That is where they shall hie to, along with any survivors.

217
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,540
包括你母親
Your mother included.

218
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:48,910
提高警惕 奧克現在白天也會出來行動
And be wary. The Orcs will move in daylight now.

219
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:52,830
我之前殺過奧克 你知道的
I've killed Orcs before, you know.

220
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:56,330
我像你這個年紀的時候 根本沒有奧克這種東西
When I was your age, there was no such thing as Orcs.

221
00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:59,540
現在呢 你殺過多少奧克
And now? How many have you killed?

222
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:01,700
-很多 -很好
-Many. -Good.

223
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,500
我可不會用“很好”這樣的詞
I would not use such words.

224
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:06,580
為什么
Why not?

225
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,580
把黑暗的殺戮行徑稱為“很好” 會讓內心變得黑暗
It darkens the heart, to call dark deeds "good."

226
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:14,660
黑暗會乘虛而入在我們體內滋長
It gives place for evil to thrive inside us.

227
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:18,450
每場戰爭都有外在之仗和內在之仗
Every war is fought both without and within.

228
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:22,000
對此 所有士兵都必須謹慎留意
Of that, every soldier must be mindful.

229
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:26,290
即便你我也不例外
Even I. Even you.

230
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:29,200
那我算士兵了嗎
Am I a soldier, then?

231
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,200
或許我們可以把你算作士兵
Perhaps we can make one of you yet.

232
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:24,660
還要走多遠才能到達營地
How much further until we reach the encampment?

233
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,580
過了這個坡就到了
It's just beyond this rise.

234
00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:43,330
還要走多遠眼前的煙霧才能散去
How much further until we're clear of this smoke?

235
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:47,790
停下
Hold here.

236
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:01,750
煙霧已經散去多遠了
How long have we been clear of it?

237
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,580
將近一英里
Nearly a mile.

238
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,450
我清楚了
I see.

239
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:23,330
您能看清楚了嗎
Do you?

240
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,450
只看到灰蒙蒙的一片
Only gray.

241
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,830
你們兩個繼續走
Keep walking, both of you.

242
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:40,080
牽著我的馬 別讓任何人看出來
Guide my horse. No one need notice.

243
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:43,870
埃蘭迪爾
Elendil?

244
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:48,290
埃蘭迪爾 拜托了
Elendil, please.

245
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:50,540
繼續走
Keep walking.

246
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:19,200
他們稱這里為大綠林
They call it Greenwood the Great.

247
00:26:19,290 --> 00:26:22,790
把頭低下 眼睛盯緊那片懸崖
Keep your head down and your eye on that line of cliffs.

248
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:25,950
你會在遠處找到人類的居住地
You'll find the big folk settlements on the far side.

249
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:30,700
運氣好的話 那里的人可以幫你找到你的星星
With any luck, the people there can help you find your stars.

250
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:38,450
因為我只能告訴你
'Cause all I can tell you is,

251
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:40,250
自打一千多年前
Harfoot-folk haven't seen 'em

252
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:43,290
我們的祖先生活在不知名的地方以來
since the days our ancestors lived in parts unknown

253
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:45,410
毛腳族就沒見過他們了
over a thousand years ago.

254
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:50,200
即便對你這種大長腿而言 走這么遙遠的路也絕非易事
And that's a long time to wander. Even for a fellow with big legs.

255
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,830
早知道就不應該偏離路線
Should've just stayed on-trail.

256
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:17,040
早知道當初看到 那顆墜落的星星時 我就該放任不管
When I saw that star falling, I should've just let it alone.

257
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,500
-埃拉諾… -您之前提醒過我 媽媽
-Elanor... -You tried to tell me, Mother.

258
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,830
但我現在才明白
But now I understand.

259
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,700
我只是個毛腳族
I'm just a Harfoot.

260
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:33,830
永遠只會是個毛腳族
That's all I'll ever be.

261
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,200
去睡覺吧 諾瑞
Off to bed, Nori.

262
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:44,910
剩下的事我們可以早上再處理
We can tend to the rest in the mornin'.

263
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:19,410
你失去過親近的人嗎
Have you ever lost someone close?

264
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,290
被奧克殺害的那種
To them?

265
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,540
我是說親戚
Kin, I mean.

266
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:30,080
我哥哥 芬羅德
My brother. Finrod.

267
00:30:36,410 --> 00:30:37,750
還有我丈夫
And my husband.

268
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:40,660
丈夫
Husband?

269
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:44,040
他叫凱勒博恩
Celeborn was his name.

270
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,870
我們初識于一片花叢中
We met in a glade of flowers.

271
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:52,750
當時我在跳舞 他看到了我
I was dancing and he saw me there.

272
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,790
你 跳舞
You were dancing?

273
00:30:57,950 --> 00:31:00,450
那時候戰爭似乎還很遙遠
The war seemed so very far away then.

274
00:31:04,290 --> 00:31:06,290
他去參戰的時候 我還責備了他
When he went to it, I chided him.

275
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,120
他的盔甲不合身
His armor didn't fit properly.

276
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:12,450
我就嘲笑他像個銀蛤蜊
I called him a silver clam.

277
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:18,870
但之后我再也沒有見過他
I never saw him again after that.

278
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,450
夫人
My lady.

279
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:35,160
你之前所說的…
What you said before...

280
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:37,870
并不正確
You're wrong.

281
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:40,620
這不是你的錯
It isn't your fault.

282
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:43,080
是我的錯
It's mine.

283
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:45,500
現在這樣也并非你的本意
You did not intend for this to happen.

284
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:50,580
我給了敵人力量 所以我有責任
I gave power to the enemy. So that makes me responsible.

285
00:31:51,290 --> 00:31:53,450
有人說 世間萬物就是如此
Some say that is the way of things.

286
00:31:55,790 --> 00:31:59,370
但我相信聰明的人 還會審視我們的初衷和本意
But I believe the wise also look upon what is in our hearts.

287
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:02,290
現在這樣絕非你的本意
And this was not in yours.

288
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:08,540
別把今天的重擔都攬在 自己肩上 希奧
Do not take the burden of this day upon your shoulders, Theo.

289
00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:13,540
你可能會發現 重擔一旦扛起 想要卸下就會很難
You may find it difficult to put it down again.

290
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:21,080
但是我怎么才能做到放手呢
But how am I to let it go?

291
00:32:29,290 --> 00:32:34,200
在這個世界上 有超越黑暗的力量在運作
There are powers beyond darkness at work in this world.

292
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:38,290
或許在這樣的日子里
Perhaps on days such as this,

293
00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:41,370
我們別無選擇 只能相信他們的計劃
we've little choice but to trust to their designs.

294
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:44,160
放棄我們自己的計劃
And surrender our own.

295
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:47,330
我的家沒了
My home is gone.

296
00:32:50,370 --> 00:32:52,200
這里邊有什么計劃可言嗎
Where's the design in that?

297
00:32:58,950 --> 00:33:00,540
我現在還看不明白
I cannot yet see it.

298
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:21,910
長官…
-Stop.

299
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:23,660
閉嘴
Shut it.

300
00:34:13,910 --> 00:34:17,040
是什么 你聞到了什么味道
What is it? What do you smell?

301
00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:27,950
灰燼
Ashes.

302
00:34:28,870 --> 00:34:30,870
什么都沒有 只有灰燼
Nothin' but ashes.

303
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:36,450
走吧 我們這是在浪費時間
Come on. We're wasting time.

304
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:49,410
盡可能多休息
Rest while you can.

305
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:52,200
天一亮我們就出發
We move at first light.

306
00:34:54,370 --> 00:34:55,790
哪還有天亮可言
What light?

307
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:28,450
又是一波震動
Another tremor.

308
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,540
我們得先等巖石穩定下來
We need to give the rocks time to resettle.

309
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,540
精靈大師 要高度自律
Self-discipline, master Elf.

310
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:50,040
自律能給你帶來成功嗎
Think that'll bring you success?

311
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:53,120
反正讓我在比賽中贏了你
It did in our contest.

312
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:56,080
是嗎
Did it?

313
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,080
不會吧
No.

314
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:10,580
你是故意輸給我的嗎
You lost on purpose?

315
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:12,540
我的目標從來都不是打敗你
My aim was never to defeat you,

316
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,660
而是得到你的持續關注
but to gain your ear a while longer.

317
00:36:16,290 --> 00:36:18,120
你這精靈撒謊
Elf lies.

318
00:36:21,910 --> 00:36:23,540
我當時就是…
I was...

319
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:27,950
累得沒喘上氣而已
Winded.

320
00:36:37,870 --> 00:36:38,950
真煩人
Blast it.

321
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:47,160
我一直覺得 你這精靈身上有點矮人的特質
I always thought you were a mite Dwarvish for an Elf.

322
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:51,500
而我覺得 你是個有精靈特征的矮人 都林
And you are a rather Elvish Dwarf, Durin.

323
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,450
都林之子
-Son of Durin.

324
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,370
-那誰…的孫子 -隨便你怎么嘲笑
-Grandson of... -Scoff if you like.

325
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:03,950
矮人最偉大的成就 就是不負父輩的名字
The mightiest thing a Dwarf can do is to be worthy of the name of his father.

326
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:12,200
但我們確實有自己的秘密名字
We do have our secret names,

327
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,870
只供自己人使用
for use only amongst ourselves.

328
00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:19,290
這些名字只會告訴家人
And we reveal them only to family.

329
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:25,330
妻子 父母 姐妹 兄弟
Wives, parents, sisters, brothers.

330
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:35,580
-埃爾隆德… -先別說了 都林
-Elrond... -Save it, Durin.

331
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:40,200
等成功了再告訴我
For the far side.

332
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:43,750
好吧
Aye.

333
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:03,500
都林…
Durin...

334
00:39:10,450 --> 00:39:11,580
父親…
Father...

335
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:17,160
秘銀比我們想象的還要多
It's more than we ever imagined.

336
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:19,660
-都林國王 有一個… -夠了
-King Durin, there is a... -Enough!

337
00:39:22,830 --> 00:39:27,080
父親 您看看吧
Father, just look at it.

338
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:32,410
抓住那個精靈
Seize the Elf.

339
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,620
當初你母親生你的時候
When your mother bore you,

340
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:33,160
你體內是有某種缺陷的
something inside you was ill-formed.

341
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:36,660
你的呼吸又干又澀
Your breathing was ragged and dry.

342
00:40:38,830 --> 00:40:43,500
呼吸聲很微弱 很可憐 就像白堊石在刮擦
A tiny, pitiful sound, like scraping chalkstones.

343
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:48,750
人們說你肯定熬不過第一個冬天
Folk said you'd never see your first winter.

344
00:40:51,830 --> 00:40:53,330
每天晚上
And every night,

345
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:58,700
你母親哭累了入睡之后
after your mother's weeping eyes had found refuge in sleep,

346
00:41:00,370 --> 00:41:02,370
我都會把你抱到火光下
I held you to the firelight,

347
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:06,620
整晚都抬著你的下巴
kept your chin up all night long.

348
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:10,830
這樣似乎減輕了一點負擔
Seemed to ease the burden a little.

349
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:13,410
有一天晚上
And one night,

350
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:16,750
我凝視著你乳臭未干的小臉蛋
I gazed down on your tiny, naked face,

351
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:20,580
仿佛從中看到了
and I saw upon it

352
00:41:22,870 --> 00:41:28,870
一位老矮人國王的白色胡須
the great gray beard of an old Dwarven-king.

353
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:34,450
像奔赴戰場的軍隊一樣強大而霸氣
Mighty and terrible as an army with banners.

354
00:41:38,290 --> 00:41:41,500
當你母親醒來時我告訴她
And when your mother woke, I told her,

355
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:46,330
她以后不用再哭了
she need cry no more.

356
00:41:46,410 --> 00:41:52,410
因為我們的兒子會活著 會有移山填海般的出息
Our son would live and he would move mountains!

357
00:41:58,870 --> 00:42:02,080
父親 我挖個小洞您就能氣成這樣
How do you expect me to move mountains, Father,

358
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:05,500
您還指望我如何移山
if you fall to pieces when I dig a single hole?

359
00:42:06,410 --> 00:42:08,500
您嘴上說著讓我立下輝煌大業
You speak of greatness for me,

360
00:42:09,330 --> 00:42:13,200
但卻扼殺我的所有野心
but you suffocate in me any ambition,

361
00:42:13,290 --> 00:42:15,250
所有渴望
any desire,

362
00:42:15,330 --> 00:42:20,450
以及任何只要不是源自于您的想法
any thought that does not originate in you.

363
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:23,830
天將降大任于斯人也
The iron that must bear the most heavy of burdens

364
00:42:23,910 --> 00:42:27,250
必先苦其心志 勞其筋骨
must also endure the most rigorous tempering!

365
00:42:27,330 --> 00:42:30,950
讓盟友去送死可不是苦心志勞筋骨
Consigning your allies to death is not tempering.

366
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:36,950
埃爾隆德和我情同手足
Elrond is as much a brother to me

367
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:40,580
就好像是同一個母親生的親兄弟
as if he'd been fired in my own mother's womb.

368
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:43,870
你怎么敢…
How dare you...

369
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:51,500
沒大沒小
How dare you!

370
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:54,700
拿你母親的記憶說事
Invoke your mother's memory

371
00:42:54,790 --> 00:42:58,410
借此來為背叛同胞的決定狡辯
to defend your decision to betray your own kind?

372
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:01,370
不 是你背叛了我們的同胞
No! It's you that's betrayed our kind!

373
00:43:01,450 --> 00:43:05,290
浪費我們的未來 就為了讓你自己能夠活在過去
Squandering our future so you can cling to the past!

374
00:43:05,370 --> 00:43:07,950
你褻瀆了頭頂的王冠
You profane the crown you wear!

375
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:51,950
把家徽放下吧
Leave it.

376
00:43:54,950 --> 00:43:56,620
反正再也不是你的了
It's not yours anymore.

377
00:44:13,910 --> 00:44:18,540
在那個秋日 他捕食蝸牛
And while he was a snailin' Upon that autumn day

378
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:22,410
他任由寶寶哭泣 溪流將女兒沖走
His babe he left a-wailin' The stream took her away

379
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:25,700
波比 你在干什么
-Poppy? -What are you doin'?

380
00:44:25,790 --> 00:44:27,750
我拎個桶 你覺得我能在干什么
Fetchin' a pail, what's it look like?

381
00:44:27,830 --> 00:44:30,750
你個饕餮 別吃了  這些食物我們得留著
No, the vittles. Stop eatin'! We have to save those.

382
00:44:30,830 --> 00:44:34,620
你先出去看一眼 然后我們再聊
Why don't you take a look outside, and then we'll talk.

383
00:44:37,290 --> 00:44:38,120
怎么回事…
What...

384
00:44:43,620 --> 00:44:47,040
-看看那個 哇  -我們可以把那些作物賣到市場…
Look at that! Oh, wow! We'll go to market with that crop, won't we?

385
00:44:51,450 --> 00:44:52,290
這給你
Here you go.

386
00:44:54,620 --> 00:44:57,750
我不明白 這是怎么回事
I don't understand. How?

387
00:44:57,830 --> 00:44:59,080
你怎么看
How do you think?

388
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:02,120
是他搞定的
He fixed it.

389
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,790
諾瑞 你敢信嗎
Can you believe it, Nori?

390
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:08,200
這些吃的足夠我們今晚大快朵頤
There's enough bounty here to feast tonight

391
00:45:08,290 --> 00:45:11,200
而且剩下的足夠我們撐到 遷徙到凍魚區
and still have enough left over to last to Frozen Fish.

392
00:45:11,290 --> 00:45:14,410
瑪爾娃說她要做一種 叫“蘋果香腸”的東西
Malva's sayin' she gonna make somethin' called apple-sausage.

393
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:16,500
-是蘋果醬 -我就是這么說的
-Applesauce. -That's what I said.

394
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:31,450
父親
From Father.

395
00:45:31,540 --> 00:45:33,830
謝謝你 瑪爾娃 你姐姐去哪了
Thank you, Malva. Where's your sister gone?

396
00:45:33,910 --> 00:45:37,290
我們來弄 里邊還有空間嗎  我們好了
We got it. Is there more space in there? We're done.

397
00:45:37,830 --> 00:45:41,250
…沿河漂流 她大聲啼哭
...floated down it So loudly she did wail

398
00:45:41,330 --> 00:45:43,410
蛙魚之王
The King of the Frog Fishies

399
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:45,750
把她變成了一只蝸牛
Turned her into a snail

400
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:51,000
老博爾格巴克 抓住了她 如此多汁 如此香甜
Old Bolgerbuck he caught her So juicy and so sweet

401
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:55,080
他們說這是他的小女兒 但他忍不住想…
They say his little daughter He could not help but...

402
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:43,830
等等
Wait!

403
00:47:45,910 --> 00:47:47,540
你們走錯路了
You're going the wrong way.

404
00:47:49,790 --> 00:47:51,250
他去那邊了
He went that way.

405
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,250
快去吧
Go on, now.

406
00:48:07,910 --> 00:48:09,120
諾瑞
Nori!

407
00:48:12,410 --> 00:48:14,330
-別碰她  -聽見沒有
-Leave her alone! -You heard her.

408
00:48:14,410 --> 00:48:16,330
-滾開  -走開
-Off with you now! -Begone!

409
00:48:17,370 --> 00:48:20,870
敢碰她一根毛 我就敲碎你們的腦袋
You harm a hair on her foot, and I'll brain the lot of ya.

410
00:49:35,950 --> 00:49:38,500
來吧 好了 把手伸出來
Come on. All right. Keep your hands on.

411
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:41,040
現在把雙手合起來
Together now.

412
00:49:45,830 --> 00:49:46,790
哇
Whoa!

413
00:49:49,410 --> 00:49:50,830
把它交給我吧
Give him to me.

414
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:56,870
不行
No!

415
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:00,540
你得回家 聽到我說的話了嗎
You're going home. Do you hear me?

416
00:50:01,580 --> 00:50:03,000
你跟我們一起回家
You're coming with us.

417
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:13,330
求你了 貝雷克
Please. Berek.

418
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:16,750
-求你了 -它不會聽你的
-Please. -He won't listen to you.

419
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
它不聽我們任何人的
He won't listen to any of us.

420
00:50:57,080 --> 00:50:59,660
我當初就不應該把那個精靈拉上船
I should never have pulled the Elf on board.

421
00:51:02,450 --> 00:51:05,120
在海里遇到她時 我就應該把她留在海里
I should've left her in the sea, where I found her.

422
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:48,540
希奧
Theo?

423
00:53:34,830 --> 00:53:38,660
攝政女王在這里嗎
The Queen Regent. Is she here?

424
00:53:45,910 --> 00:53:47,910
準備工作基本完成
Preparations are nearly complete.

425
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:50,870
我們可以在一小時內出發
We can depart within the hour.

426
00:53:51,450 --> 00:53:53,540
中洲南方的人怎么辦
What of the Southlanders?

427
00:53:53,620 --> 00:53:57,620
有一支駐軍將墊后 負責護送他們前往安全的定居點
One garrison will remain behind to escort them to a safe settlement.

428
00:53:59,540 --> 00:54:01,200
順便尋找我們失蹤的人
And search for our missing.

429
00:54:12,330 --> 00:54:13,330
加拉德瑞爾
Galadriel.

430
00:54:36,910 --> 00:54:38,660
努門諾爾不允許下跪
No one kneels in Númenor.

431
00:54:39,790 --> 00:54:41,790
這里不是努門諾爾
You are not in Númenor.

432
00:54:42,910 --> 00:54:44,910
大家都不在努門諾爾
Neither of you are.

433
00:54:45,620 --> 00:54:48,040
都是我的錯
A fault that is mine alone.

434
00:54:48,580 --> 00:54:51,160
船只都在待命 女王
Our ships are waiting, my Queen.

435
00:54:53,950 --> 00:54:56,290
我們離開這片大陸吧
Let us put this land behind our sails.

436
00:55:16,910 --> 00:55:19,750
別憐憫我 精靈
Do not spend your pity on me, Elf.

437
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:24,160
留著將來可憐我們的敵人吧
Save it for our enemies.

438
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:28,450
因為敵人不知道它們已經挑起了大戰
For they do not know what they have begun.

439
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:39,870
因為我 彌瑞爾
For I, Míriel,

440
00:55:40,910 --> 00:55:43,540
塔爾帕藍提爾之女 我發誓
daughter of Ar-Inzilad?n, vow this.

441
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:45,830
努門諾爾必將回歸
Númenor will return.

442
00:55:48,540 --> 00:55:51,620
精靈將時刻準備著
Then the Elves will be ready.

443
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:58,200
船長 我們隨時可以出發
Captain, we sail with the tide.

444
00:56:01,870 --> 00:56:03,120
船長
Captain?

445
00:56:12,370 --> 00:56:13,620
好了
I got it.

446
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:35,160
站起來吧 姑娘 能拿什么就幫我拿著點
On your feet now, girl. Stand up. Help me gather what we can.

447
00:56:36,950 --> 00:56:38,950
諾瑞 快點
Nori, now.

448
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:42,000
別垂頭喪氣的 一切都會好的
Don't let this splinter your spirit, it'll be all right.

449
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:45,830
拉哥 別騙她 她這么大了 能聽得出真話假話
Don't lie to her, Largo. She's too old for that now.

450
00:56:45,910 --> 00:56:48,290
我沒撒謊 一切都會變好的
I wasn't lyin'. It will be all right.

451
00:56:48,370 --> 00:56:50,160
天啊 白蘭地足
Pity's sake, Brandyfoot.

452
00:56:50,250 --> 00:56:52,040
就讓我們哭一會兒吧
Give us a moment to weep.

453
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:53,410
哭
Weepin'?

454
00:56:53,870 --> 00:56:56,370
你們覺得我們只能哭了嗎
Is that all you think we have left in us?

455
00:56:56,450 --> 00:56:57,950
我們可是毛腳族
We're Harfoots!

456
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:11,410
我們不會屠龍
Look, we don't slay dragons.

457
00:57:12,950 --> 00:57:15,040
對挖寶藏也沒什么興趣
Not much for diggin' jewels.

458
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:17,330
但我保證有件事我們很擅長
But there's one thing we can do, I warrant,

459
00:57:17,410 --> 00:57:20,370
而且比中洲的任何生物都要做得好
better than any creature in all Middle-earth.

460
00:57:22,750 --> 00:57:24,370
那就是我們彼此忠貞不渝
We stay true to each other.

461
00:57:26,370 --> 00:57:30,410
無論前路如何曲折 或多么陡峭
No matter how the path winds, or how steep it gets,

462
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:33,500
我們敢于直面
we face it,

463
00:57:34,830 --> 00:57:38,660
勇氣和意志比我們的大腳還要強大
with our hearts even bigger than our feet.

464
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:43,160
我們只管繼續前行
And we just keep walkin'.

465
00:58:08,870 --> 00:58:11,370
諾瑞 你要去哪
Nori. Where are you goin'?

466
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:15,830
去幫助我朋友
To help my friend.

467
00:58:16,870 --> 00:58:19,870
警告他將要發生的事情 這起碼是他理應得到的幫助
Warn him what's comin'. He deserves at least that.

468
00:58:19,950 --> 00:58:23,200
你現在要偏離路線 獨自前往
Goin' off-trail? Now? Alone?

469
00:58:23,290 --> 00:58:24,540
她不會獨行的
She won't be alone.

470
00:58:28,750 --> 00:58:31,830
我們已經拋下了許多同胞 不能把他也丟下
We've left enough folk behind, we're not leavin' him.

471
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:36,410
你們倆姑娘哪兒也不能去
You girls aren't goin' anywhere.

472
00:58:37,790 --> 00:58:39,620
必須有我同去
Not without me.

473
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,830
戈爾迪 你確定嗎
You sure about this, Goldie?

474
00:58:45,910 --> 00:58:49,750
你們走進那片樹林 可能永遠都無法活著走出來
You go into those woods, you might never come out alive.

475
00:58:49,830 --> 00:58:53,540
如果能有探路者一起去 她們有可能會安全返回
They might if a trail-finder were to go with them.

476
00:58:55,370 --> 00:58:59,370
白蘭地足小姑娘 幫他是對的 自始至終都是對的
Brandyfoot girl was right to help him. Was right all along.

477
00:58:59,450 --> 00:59:02,950
如果你覺得瑪爾娃密都格拉斯 太過驕傲而不敢承認
And if you think Malva Meadowgrass is too proud to admit it,

478
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:07,040
薩道克 那你覺得 不講情義地活著還有什么意義嗎
well, what's the good of livin', Sadoc, if we aren't livin' good?

479
00:59:10,910 --> 00:59:14,120
你知道嗎 瑪爾娃 哪怕就一回…
You know, Malva, just once...

480
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:18,450
你能承認自己不是每次都對 那可就太好了
Once, it would be grand if you weren't right all the time.

481
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:22,370
我去拿口糧 給我拿根拐杖
I'll fetch provisions and get me stick.

482
00:59:23,290 --> 00:59:24,450
我和你們一起去
I'm comin' with ya.

483
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:30,500
無所謂 反正我們終有一死
It doesn't matter anyway, we're all gonna die.

484
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,660
快走吧 不然一整天都得待在這里了
Come on, otherwise we'll be here all day.

485
00:59:34,750 --> 00:59:36,660
你覺得我們能找到他嗎
Think we'll be able to find him?

486
00:59:36,750 --> 00:59:39,790
他可是個巨人啊 我們怎么會找不到他
He's a bloody giant. How could we miss him?

487
01:00:03,750 --> 01:00:06,290
你相信她會信守諾言嗎
You believe she'll keep her promise?

488
01:00:06,370 --> 01:00:07,540
不信
No.

489
01:00:08,580 --> 01:00:10,000
我很確定
I'm certain of it.

490
01:00:11,790 --> 01:00:16,200
骨頭已經固定 傷口已經包扎 我們可以出發了
Bones have been set, wounds bound. We can travel.

491
01:00:16,790 --> 01:00:18,700
你要去哪
Where will you go?

492
01:00:18,790 --> 01:00:22,080
去安都因河口 一個古老的努門諾爾殖民地
An old Númenórean colony by the mouth of the Anduin.

493
01:00:22,620 --> 01:00:27,540
他們稱之為佩拉基爾 據說那里有新鮮的水源和土地
Pelargir, they called it. They say there's fresh land, fresh water.

494
01:00:28,370 --> 01:00:29,870
一個新的開始
A fresh start.

495
01:00:32,750 --> 01:00:34,700
那我去向至高王報告
Then I will report to our High King.

496
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
直面獎懲 任由處置
To face whatever awaits me.

497
01:00:40,950 --> 01:00:42,200
但是我們的國王呢
But what of our king?

498
01:00:43,580 --> 01:00:44,830
你們的國王
Your king?

499
01:00:45,750 --> 01:00:47,160
沒有人通知你嗎
Has no one informed you?

500
01:00:47,790 --> 01:00:49,290
通知我什么
Informed me of what?

501
01:00:56,250 --> 01:00:57,410
哈爾布蘭德
Halbrand.

502
01:01:00,370 --> 01:01:01,950
我以為你已經死了
I thought you had died.

503
01:01:03,410 --> 01:01:05,500
我要是死了反而更好
Better for me if I had done.

504
01:01:07,540 --> 01:01:11,120
昨天夜里 南方大地的人 在路上發現他傷成了這樣
Southlanders found him on the road like this yestereve.

505
01:01:12,660 --> 01:01:14,660
傷口一夜之間就腐壞了
The wound soured overnight.

506
01:01:14,750 --> 01:01:17,750
我想試著在路上給他治療 但是…
I thought to try and treat him on the road, but...

507
01:01:23,870 --> 01:01:25,870
這個傷口需要精靈族的藥
This wound needs Elvish medicine.

508
01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:28,330
他能騎馬嗎
Can he ride?

509
01:01:28,410 --> 01:01:31,790
我讓治療師盡可能多帶一些口糧
I'll have the healers gather what provisions they can.

510
01:01:40,620 --> 01:01:42,370
朋友
Well, my friend.

511
01:01:43,330 --> 01:01:46,500
看來命運又要讓我們“同筏”共濟了
It seems fate has in store for us one more raft.

512
01:01:46,580 --> 01:01:48,290
這不算完
This is not over.

513
01:01:48,370 --> 01:01:51,790
我不會放棄這片土地 也不同意他們將這里燒毀
I will not abandon these lands and condemn them to burn.

514
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:55,410
你也不可以放棄
Nor will you.

515
01:02:22,750 --> 01:02:24,080
賜國王以力量
Strength to the king!

516
01:02:24,830 --> 01:02:28,660
賜國王以力量
Strength to the king! Strength to the king!

517
01:02:28,750 --> 01:02:32,660
賜國王以力量
Strength to the king! Strength to the king!

518
01:02:32,750 --> 01:02:36,750
賜國王以力量
Strength to the king! Strength to the king!

519
01:02:48,580 --> 01:02:51,580
拿著吧…士兵
Keep it... Soldier.

520
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:56,160
指揮官
Commander.

521
01:03:05,580 --> 01:03:07,200
賜南方大地以力量
Strength to the Southlands!

522
01:03:07,290 --> 01:03:11,040
賜南方大地以力量
Strength to the Southlands! Strength to the Southlands!

523
01:03:35,120 --> 01:03:36,540
我辜負了他
I failed him.

524
01:03:38,950 --> 01:03:41,620
全都是我的錯
It's all my fault.

525
01:03:43,700 --> 01:03:44,790
不
No.

526
01:03:45,450 --> 01:03:46,750
不 不是的
No, it isn't.

527
01:03:48,370 --> 01:03:49,870
那是誰的錯
Whose is it, then?

528
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:55,000
是你父親的
It's your father's.

529
01:03:56,700 --> 01:04:00,700
他年紀大了 太多疑了
He's grown too old, too suspicious.

530
01:04:01,540 --> 01:04:03,950
思維過于羸弱
His mind, too feeble.

531
01:04:04,580 --> 01:04:07,120
雙眼發昏看不清現實
His eyes too dim to see

532
01:04:07,250 --> 01:04:10,580
不管他把你的多少家徽扔到地上
that no matter how many crests he hurls to the floor,

533
01:04:11,950 --> 01:04:14,410
總有一天 這將會是你的王國
one day this will be your kingdom.

534
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:19,040
是你都林四世的
Durin IV's.

535
01:04:19,120 --> 01:04:20,750
不是你兄弟的
Not your brother's.

536
01:04:22,910 --> 01:04:26,700
也不是其他矮人領主的 而是你的
Not some other Dwarf-lord's. Yours.

537
01:04:27,910 --> 01:04:29,250
也是我的
And mine.

538
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:35,950
在我們氣數耗盡之前 這座山和其他所有山都將歸我們統治
And together, we will rule this mountain and all others before our time is done.

539
01:04:39,290 --> 01:04:42,410
秘銀屬于我們
That mithril belongs to us.

540
01:04:43,620 --> 01:04:45,450
屬于你和我
To you and me.

541
01:04:46,370 --> 01:04:48,790
總有一天 我們一起
And together, one day,

542
01:04:49,950 --> 01:04:52,200
共同去挖掘秘銀
we are going to dig.

543
01:05:18,830 --> 01:05:23,370
把秘銀礦封起來
Seal it up.

544
01:05:54,040 --> 01:05:55,290
孩子們
My children.

545
01:05:56,660 --> 01:05:59,330
脫掉你們的太陽斗篷和頭盔吧
Cast off your sun-cloaks and your helms.

546
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,580
白日的光亮再也無法灼傷你們了
You are no longer to be burdened by the day.

547
01:06:03,950 --> 01:06:05,540
這片土地現在屬于我們
This is our land now.

548
01:06:08,790 --> 01:06:10,200
這里是我們的家
It is our home.

549
