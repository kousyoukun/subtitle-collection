1
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:08,125
And at the first blush
of the oak leaves,

2
00:00:08,208 --> 00:00:09,458
we head to the Grove.

3
00:00:09,541 --> 00:00:12,791
The only trouble is there's
a hundred perils between here and there.

4
00:00:13,166 --> 00:00:15,041
I'm peril.

5
00:00:15,333 --> 00:00:17,125
-Stop!

6
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:27,250
Our light is fading.

7
00:00:27,583 --> 00:00:31,083
And this  mithril...
It is our only salvation?

8
00:00:31,458 --> 00:00:35,250
So the fate of the entire Elven race...

9
00:00:35,291 --> 00:00:37,250
-...is in your hands.
-Hmm.

10
00:00:37,416 --> 00:00:38,416
Nampat!

11
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:41,291
Sauron was once
your people's enemy as much as mine.

12
00:00:42,291 --> 00:00:44,375
I call on you to reforge the alliance

13
00:00:44,458 --> 00:00:45,958
-between Númenor and Elves.

14
00:00:46,041 --> 00:00:47,625
To save the men of the Southlands.

15
00:00:50,041 --> 00:00:51,416
Give it to me.

16
00:00:51,541 --> 00:00:52,625
It's under here.

17
00:00:57,125 --> 00:01:00,208
All hail to the true
King of the Southlands.

18
00:01:00,541 --> 00:01:02,375
All hail!

19
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:09,625
Take shelter!

20
00:01:09,708 --> 00:01:10,625
The Queen!

21
00:01:11,708 --> 00:01:13,291
Theo!

22
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:30,000
Help!

23
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,416
Halbrand!

24
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:46,541
Elendil!

25
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:50,625
Halbrand!

26
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:53,416
Mother? Mother?

27
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:56,666
Mother!

28
00:04:57,416 --> 00:04:58,666
Over here.

29
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:01,916
Come here.

30
00:05:07,791 --> 00:05:10,166
-Are you hurt?
-No.

31
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,916
Stay with me.

32
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:15,958
Come on.

33
00:05:36,291 --> 00:05:39,916
Where's Ontamo?
Ontamo was with me.

34
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:43,625
Crawl.

35
00:05:43,708 --> 00:05:45,208
Crawl. I won't leave you.

36
00:05:45,625 --> 00:05:47,291
Soldier, over here!

37
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,541
Valandil.

38
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,416
Soldier, he's gone.

39
00:06:18,583 --> 00:06:19,416
He's gone.

40
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
This way!

41
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:25,083
-He's gone...
-Come on!

42
00:06:25,166 --> 00:06:27,375
-Help! Please, help!
-Soldiers!

43
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:28,791
Over here! We're inside!

44
00:06:28,875 --> 00:06:30,791
That roof's about to come down.

45
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:33,500
-Can't get out!
-Quickly, clear a path.

46
00:06:53,791 --> 00:06:56,000
Over here. This way.

47
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:58,416
Take hold of my hand. You're all right.

48
00:06:59,041 --> 00:07:01,458
Go forward. Stay together.

49
00:07:02,708 --> 00:07:04,583
-Hurry, my Queen.
-Go.

50
00:07:07,666 --> 00:07:09,041
Go towards the bridge.

51
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:10,541
Get them out of here!

52
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:15,125
-No!

53
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,208
Isildur!

54
00:07:27,166 --> 00:07:28,041
Isildur!

55
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,833
Old Bolgerbuck went snailing

56
00:07:31,916 --> 00:07:33,708
One autumn day so fine

57
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:36,500
He found a hundred big ones

58
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:38,500
I wish that they were mine

59
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:39,500
Up ahead.

60
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:42,083
The Grove! I think this is it.

61
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:43,666
Said that three days ago.

62
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:46,750
No, no, he's right. I remember this.

63
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:48,000
Come on.

64
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:52,041
Do you smell that? Wood smoke!
The others must've started bakin'.

65
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:23,166
Mr. Burrows.

66
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:25,875
What happened?

67
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:32,666
My great-grand used to speak of mountains
to the south that could spit fire-rock.

68
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:35,166
He said they go to sleep.

69
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:38,333
Sometimes for hundreds of years.

70
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:45,958
Only to wake again
when a new evil is rising.

71
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:09,416
-Hmm.
-Brandyfoot.

72
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,333
Your friend up there. The big fella.

73
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:16,333
-You don't suppose...
-Suppose what?

74
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:17,916
Maybe he could fix it.

75
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,833
-Go on, Nori.
-Yes. Like he fixed those wolves.

76
00:09:19,916 --> 00:09:22,541
-Uh, I don't know... I don't know if he...
-What you waitin' for?

77
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:23,750
He's done so much for us.

78
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:27,250
It's a mite rude of us to ask more of him.

79
00:09:28,708 --> 00:09:29,791
I see.

80
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:34,166
-I'll ask him, then.

81
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:35,500
Sadoc!

82
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:37,333
Out the way, little ones.

83
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:44,000
Á keuta...

84
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:48,750
Á envinyata...

85
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,541
Envinyata...

86
00:09:54,291 --> 00:09:56,125
Lótë na...

87
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:59,458
-Lótë na...
-What's he mutterin'?

88
00:09:59,541 --> 00:10:02,750
Likely little words,
so the tree'll understand.

89
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:04,833
Sadoc, trees don't talk.

90
00:10:04,916 --> 00:10:05,958
Some do.

91
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:08,291
Don't distract him.

92
00:10:14,166 --> 00:10:17,125
Envinyata!

93
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:18,291
Lótë na!

94
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:21,875
Great-goats. It's working...

95
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:29,208
Á kuita! Á kuita! Á kuita!

96
00:10:33,708 --> 00:10:35,125
He's fixin' it.

97
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:37,125
Just like Sadoc said he would.

98
00:10:37,208 --> 00:10:39,250
-Á kuita!

99
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:41,250
Dilly, get back!

100
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,916
-No!
-Nori!

101
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,875
My sweet girls! My babies!

102
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:50,708
Nori! Dilly! Dilly.

103
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:53,583
Dilly, Nori, are you all right?

104
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:57,041
-There you go.

105
00:10:57,125 --> 00:10:58,708
Are you all right?
Are you all right?

106
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:00,708
I'm all right. I said.

107
00:11:00,916 --> 00:11:02,166
-I'm all...

108
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:26,875
We ask for something sacred
from this mountain.

109
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:31,166
And so we offer
something sacred in return.

110
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:36,208
In exchange for access
to your  mithril  mines,

111
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:38,750
the Elves are prepared
to furnish this city

112
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:42,291
with game, grain,

113
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:47,333
and timber from the elder forests
of Eriador for the next five centuries.

114
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,083
Five centuries?

115
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:51,708
Quite a promise, if they can keep it...

116
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:54,625
I never made a promise
I didn't.

117
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:59,500
I see you've learned
a few words of stone-tongue.

118
00:12:00,541 --> 00:12:01,791
Impressive.

119
00:12:03,125 --> 00:12:06,958
Tell me, why should we trust any Elf?

120
00:12:08,791 --> 00:12:10,041
You should not.

121
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:13,750
But you can trust me.

122
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:18,333
For I am no common Elf,
but Elrond Half-elven.

123
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:23,458
And I see in Elves
that which they cannot see in themselves.

124
00:12:23,916 --> 00:12:26,708
That is why I stand
before you now, alone...

125
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:31,750
Pleading.

126
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:35,791
For you to save my people.

127
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:41,750
Please, noble King. Help us.

128
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,750
I will speak to my son now.

129
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,500
What is to be your answer, Father?

130
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:32,666
It is said that
when Aulë created our people,

131
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:35,875
he crafted us of two elements.

132
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:38,500
Fire and rock.

133
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:44,041
The rock that lives within us
hungers for the eternal,

134
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:46,125
resisting the pull of time.

135
00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:51,125
But the fire embraces truth.

136
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,916
That all things must one day
be consumed...

137
00:13:57,041 --> 00:13:59,000
-...and fade away to ash...
-Father...

138
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:01,416
We do not dig in earth
that cannot support it.

139
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:04,291
-Delving into depths beyond the darkness.

140
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:09,166
Tempting shadow, rock, and mine
to bury us all beneath the mountain.

141
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:12,333
I will not risk Dwarven lives

142
00:14:13,583 --> 00:14:15,541
to help the Elves cheat death.

143
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:17,208
Cheat death?

144
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:19,833
Father!

145
00:14:23,041 --> 00:14:26,458
My friend is drowning,

146
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:30,583
reaching for me to pull him to shore.

147
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:32,833
You expect me to swat his hand away

148
00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:35,166
because you're afraid
of a bloody rock fall?

149
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:38,708
The fate of the Elves
was decided many Ages ago.

150
00:14:39,541 --> 00:14:42,166
By minds much wiser,

151
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:45,375
much farther-seeing than our own.

152
00:14:46,916 --> 00:14:51,916
Defy their will,
and this entire kingdom might fall.

153
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:55,875
Perhaps the entire Middle-earth.

154
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:09,166
I am sorry, my son.

155
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:14,541
But their time has come.

156
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:19,750
-Lice-bearded, uncaring, old fool!

157
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:21,041
What if he's right?

158
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:23,791
You're not thinking
of lettin' this happen!

159
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,041
What choice do we have?

160
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:32,166
You said the other Dwarf-lords
were open to the proposal.

161
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:34,833
If we reopen the mine ourselves,

162
00:15:34,916 --> 00:15:37,791
prove to them there's a safe way
to gather  mithril,

163
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:39,541
perhaps they'd make him listen.

164
00:15:39,625 --> 00:15:42,625
Perhaps we could force your father's hand.

165
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:45,833
He's more
than just my father, Disa.

166
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:49,333
He's our king.

167
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:52,708
What kind of father would I be

168
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:55,125
if I teach our children the will of a king

169
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:58,166
should be counted as dross
to be cast to the wind?

170
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:07,708
-All right, fine.

171
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:09,833
I shouldn't have said
he had lice in his beard.

172
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:14,458
-Or called him a fool.
-Yeah.

173
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:15,625
No.

174
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:20,041
No, I detest it
when you heap slag on my mother.

175
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:24,666
Uh, well, in your mother's case,
she actually does have lice in her...

176
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,500
I'm joking. I'm joking.

177
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:07,000
Don't suppose I can
elbow you into staying for dinner?

178
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:10,125
Gil-galad must be informed.

179
00:17:12,875 --> 00:17:17,583
And soon, he will no longer be a king,
for there will no longer be a Lindon.

180
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:26,833
So this is goodbye, then?

181
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:30,625
We do not say goodbye.

182
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:40,916
-We say  namá...
-Namárië.

183
00:17:42,416 --> 00:17:44,625
It means more than simply "farewell."

184
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:51,208
It means... "Go towards goodness."

185
00:19:13,875 --> 00:19:15,083
Elrond!

186
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:29,791
Why'd they do this?

187
00:19:31,541 --> 00:19:32,958
To make this their home.

188
00:19:34,375 --> 00:19:35,708
Their Shadow Land.

189
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,833
So we take it back, and drive them off.

190
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:41,250
We have neither position,
nor reinforcement.

191
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:43,500
These lands are dead.

192
00:19:44,208 --> 00:19:45,625
We must rally to the living.

193
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:47,583
Or put steel down their throats!

194
00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:51,041
It is over.

195
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:52,833
Not for me. I won't allow it!

196
00:19:52,916 --> 00:19:54,166
We must!

197
00:19:57,666 --> 00:19:58,916
We must.

198
00:20:03,875 --> 00:20:06,958
What are you so bothered about?
It isn't your fault.

199
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:11,291
Yes, it is.

200
00:20:21,666 --> 00:20:24,208
Keep moving. That's it.

201
00:20:30,916 --> 00:20:32,791
Help those people at the back there.

202
00:21:00,916 --> 00:21:02,291
Isildur?

203
00:21:14,916 --> 00:21:17,083
-The Queen!
-She's alive.

204
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:19,083
-Is she hurt?
-Save us!

205
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:21,125
-Is she hurt?
-Is she all right?

206
00:21:21,208 --> 00:21:22,291
Thank goodness!

207
00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:27,958
My Queen.

208
00:21:35,083 --> 00:21:36,333
Take my horse.

209
00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:48,333
Captain, you...

210
00:21:51,291 --> 00:21:53,416
-Captain...
-Where is he?

211
00:21:58,833 --> 00:22:00,500
Where is my son?

212
00:22:03,833 --> 00:22:06,458
They're dead, aren't they?

213
00:22:08,458 --> 00:22:12,333
Arondir. My friends. My...

214
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:16,541
My mother. Everyone.

215
00:22:17,791 --> 00:22:22,791
What cannot be known hollows the mind.
Fill it not with guesswork.

216
00:22:29,166 --> 00:22:30,875
Where are we even going?

217
00:22:30,958 --> 00:22:34,333
Númenor set their camp
upon that ridgeline,

218
00:22:34,416 --> 00:22:35,833
beyond that far peak.

219
00:22:36,583 --> 00:22:39,375
That is where they shall hie to,
along with any survivors.

220
00:22:42,125 --> 00:22:43,541
Your mother included.

221
00:22:45,666 --> 00:22:48,916
And be wary.
The Orcs will move in daylight now.

222
00:22:50,583 --> 00:22:52,833
I've killed Orcs before, you know.

223
00:22:52,916 --> 00:22:56,333
When I was your age,
there was no such thing as Orcs.

224
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:59,541
And now? How many have you killed?

225
00:22:59,625 --> 00:23:01,708
-Many.
-Good.

226
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,500
I would not use such words.

227
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:06,583
Why not?

228
00:23:07,208 --> 00:23:10,583
It darkens the heart,
to call dark deeds "good."

229
00:23:11,916 --> 00:23:14,666
It gives place for evil
to thrive inside us.

230
00:23:15,875 --> 00:23:18,458
Every war is fought
both without and within.

231
00:23:19,666 --> 00:23:22,000
Of that, every soldier must be mindful.

232
00:23:23,541 --> 00:23:26,291
Even I. Even you.

233
00:23:27,958 --> 00:23:29,208
Am I a soldier, then?

234
00:23:40,083 --> 00:23:42,208
Perhaps we can make one of you yet.

235
00:24:21,916 --> 00:24:24,666
How much further
until we reach the encampment?

236
00:24:26,041 --> 00:24:27,583
It's just beyond this rise.

237
00:24:40,333 --> 00:24:43,333
How much further
until we're clear of this smoke?

238
00:24:46,958 --> 00:24:47,791
Hold here.

239
00:24:59,583 --> 00:25:01,750
How long have we been clear of it?

240
00:25:03,166 --> 00:25:04,583
Nearly a mile.

241
00:25:06,208 --> 00:25:07,458
I see.

242
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:23,333
Do you?

243
00:25:26,208 --> 00:25:27,458
Only gray.

244
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,833
Keep walking, both of you.

245
00:25:36,916 --> 00:25:40,083
Guide my horse. No one need notice.

246
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:43,875
Elendil?

247
00:25:46,166 --> 00:25:48,291
Elendil, please.

248
00:25:49,291 --> 00:25:50,541
Keep walking.

249
00:26:17,041 --> 00:26:19,208
They call it Greenwood the Great.

250
00:26:19,291 --> 00:26:22,791
Keep your head down
and your eye on that line of cliffs.

251
00:26:22,875 --> 00:26:25,958
You'll find the big folk settlements
on the far side.

252
00:26:26,791 --> 00:26:30,708
With any luck, the people there
can help you find your stars.

253
00:26:36,708 --> 00:26:38,458
'Cause all I can tell you is,

254
00:26:38,541 --> 00:26:40,250
Harfoot-folk haven't seen 'em

255
00:26:40,333 --> 00:26:43,291
since the days our ancestors
lived in parts unknown

256
00:26:43,375 --> 00:26:45,416
over a thousand years ago.

257
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:50,208
And that's a long time to wander.
Even for a fellow with big legs.

258
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,833
Should've just stayed on-trail.

259
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:16,541
When I saw that star falling,
I should've just let it alone.

260
00:29:16,625 --> 00:29:19,500
-Elanor...
-You tried to tell me, Mother.

261
00:29:22,208 --> 00:29:23,833
But now I understand.

262
00:29:26,125 --> 00:29:27,708
I'm just a Harfoot.

263
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:33,833
That's all I'll ever be.

264
00:29:38,208 --> 00:29:40,208
Off to bed, Nori.

265
00:29:42,583 --> 00:29:44,916
We can tend to the rest in the mornin'.

266
00:30:17,416 --> 00:30:19,416
Have you ever lost someone close?

267
00:30:21,125 --> 00:30:22,291
To them?

268
00:30:24,125 --> 00:30:25,541
Kin, I mean.

269
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:30,083
My brother. Finrod.

270
00:30:36,416 --> 00:30:37,750
And my husband.

271
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:40,666
Husband?

272
00:30:41,541 --> 00:30:44,041
Celeborn was his name.

273
00:30:47,041 --> 00:30:48,875
We met in a glade of flowers.

274
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:52,750
I was dancing and he saw me there.

275
00:30:55,041 --> 00:30:56,791
You were dancing?

276
00:30:57,958 --> 00:31:00,458
The war seemed so very far away then.

277
00:31:04,291 --> 00:31:06,291
When he went to it, I chided him.

278
00:31:07,125 --> 00:31:09,125
His armor didn't fit properly.

279
00:31:10,791 --> 00:31:12,458
I called him a silver clam.

280
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:18,875
I never saw him again after that.

281
00:31:30,041 --> 00:31:31,458
My lady.

282
00:31:33,708 --> 00:31:35,166
What you said before...

283
00:31:36,666 --> 00:31:37,875
You're wrong.

284
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:40,625
It isn't your fault.

285
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:43,083
It's mine.

286
00:31:43,166 --> 00:31:45,500
You did not intend for this to happen.

287
00:31:46,125 --> 00:31:50,583
I gave power to the enemy.
So that makes me responsible.

288
00:31:51,291 --> 00:31:53,458
Some say that is the way of things.

289
00:31:55,791 --> 00:31:58,666
But I believe the wise
also look upon what is in our hearts.

290
00:32:00,708 --> 00:32:02,291
And this was not in yours.

291
00:32:04,958 --> 00:32:08,541
Do not take the burden of this day
upon your shoulders, Theo.

292
00:32:10,791 --> 00:32:13,541
You may find it difficult
to put it down again.

293
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:21,083
But how am I to let it go?

294
00:32:29,291 --> 00:32:34,208
There are powers beyond darkness
at work in this world.

295
00:32:36,166 --> 00:32:38,291
Perhaps on days such as this,

296
00:32:38,375 --> 00:32:41,375
we've little choice
but to trust to their designs.

297
00:32:42,666 --> 00:32:44,166
And surrender our own.

298
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:47,333
My home is gone.

299
00:32:50,375 --> 00:32:52,208
Where's the design in that?

300
00:32:58,958 --> 00:33:00,541
I cannot yet see it.

301
00:33:21,083 --> 00:33:22,541
-Stop.

302
00:33:22,625 --> 00:33:23,666
Shut it.

303
00:34:13,916 --> 00:34:17,041
What is it? What do you smell?

304
00:34:17,375 --> 00:34:18,708
Huh?

305
00:34:26,791 --> 00:34:27,958
Ashes.

306
00:34:28,875 --> 00:34:30,875
Nothin' but ashes.

307
00:34:33,833 --> 00:34:36,458
Come on. We're wasting time.

308
00:34:47,541 --> 00:34:49,416
Rest while you can.

309
00:34:50,625 --> 00:34:52,208
We move at first light.

310
00:34:54,375 --> 00:34:55,791
What light?

311
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:28,458
Another tremor.

312
00:35:29,041 --> 00:35:31,541
We need to give the rocks
time to resettle.

313
00:35:42,666 --> 00:35:44,916
No.

314
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,541
Self-discipline, master Elf.

315
00:35:47,666 --> 00:35:50,041
Think that'll bring you success?

316
00:35:51,625 --> 00:35:53,125
It did in our contest.

317
00:35:54,666 --> 00:35:56,083
Did it?

318
00:36:06,083 --> 00:36:07,083
No.

319
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:10,583
You lost on purpose?

320
00:36:10,666 --> 00:36:12,541
My aim was never to defeat you,

321
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,666
but to gain your ear a while longer.

322
00:36:16,291 --> 00:36:18,125
Elf lies.

323
00:36:21,916 --> 00:36:23,541
I was...

324
00:36:26,541 --> 00:36:27,958
Winded.

325
00:36:37,875 --> 00:36:38,958
Blast it.

326
00:36:43,666 --> 00:36:47,166
I always thought you were
a mite Dwarvish for an Elf.

327
00:36:47,666 --> 00:36:51,500
And you are a rather Elvish Dwarf, Durin.

328
00:36:53,041 --> 00:36:54,458
-Son of Durin.

329
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,375
-Grandson of...
-Scoff if you like.

330
00:36:59,458 --> 00:37:03,958
The mightiest thing a Dwarf can do
is to be worthy of the name of his father.

331
00:37:10,541 --> 00:37:12,208
We do have our secret names,

332
00:37:13,208 --> 00:37:15,875
for use only amongst ourselves.

333
00:37:15,958 --> 00:37:19,291
And we reveal them only to family.

334
00:37:19,375 --> 00:37:25,333
Wives, parents, sisters, brothers.

335
00:37:33,083 --> 00:37:35,583
-Elrond...
-Save it, Durin.

336
00:37:38,791 --> 00:37:40,208
For the far side.

337
00:37:42,666 --> 00:37:43,750
Aye.

338
00:39:02,541 --> 00:39:03,500
Durin...

339
00:39:10,291 --> 00:39:12,166
Father...

340
00:39:14,541 --> 00:39:17,166
It's more than we ever imagined.

341
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:19,666
-King Durin, there is a...
-Enough!

342
00:39:22,833 --> 00:39:27,083
Father, just look at it.

343
00:39:31,083 --> 00:39:32,416
Seize the Elf.

344
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,625
When your mother bore you,

345
00:40:30,166 --> 00:40:33,166
something inside you was ill-formed.

346
00:40:34,583 --> 00:40:36,666
Your breathing was ragged and dry.

347
00:40:38,833 --> 00:40:43,500
A tiny, pitiful sound,
like scraping chalkstones.

348
00:40:46,166 --> 00:40:48,750
Folk said you'd never see
your first winter.

349
00:40:51,833 --> 00:40:53,333
And every night,

350
00:40:54,708 --> 00:40:58,708
after your mother's weeping eyes
had found refuge in sleep,

351
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:02,375
I held you to the firelight,

352
00:41:04,625 --> 00:41:06,625
kept your chin up all night long.

353
00:41:08,666 --> 00:41:10,833
Seemed to ease the burden a little.

354
00:41:12,125 --> 00:41:13,416
And one night,

355
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:16,750
I gazed down on your tiny, naked face,

356
00:41:18,583 --> 00:41:20,583
and I saw upon it

357
00:41:22,875 --> 00:41:28,875
the great gray beard
of an old Dwarven-king.

358
00:41:30,208 --> 00:41:34,458
Mighty and terrible
as an army with banners.

359
00:41:38,291 --> 00:41:41,500
And when your mother woke, I told her,

360
00:41:43,541 --> 00:41:46,333
she need cry no more.

361
00:41:46,416 --> 00:41:52,416
Our son would live
and he would move mountains!

362
00:41:58,875 --> 00:42:02,083
How do you expect me
to move mountains, Father,

363
00:42:02,166 --> 00:42:05,500
if you fall to pieces
when I dig a single hole?

364
00:42:06,416 --> 00:42:08,500
You speak of greatness for me,

365
00:42:09,333 --> 00:42:13,208
but you suffocate in me any ambition,

366
00:42:13,291 --> 00:42:15,250
any desire,

367
00:42:15,333 --> 00:42:20,458
any thought
that does not originate in you.

368
00:42:20,541 --> 00:42:23,833
The iron that must bear
the most heavy of burdens

369
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:27,250
must also endure
the most rigorous tempering!

370
00:42:27,333 --> 00:42:30,958
Consigning your allies to death
is not tempering.

371
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:36,958
Elrond is as much a brother to me

372
00:42:37,041 --> 00:42:40,583
as if he'd been fired
in my own mother's womb.

373
00:42:42,166 --> 00:42:43,875
How dare you...

374
00:42:49,666 --> 00:42:51,500
How dare you!

375
00:42:53,083 --> 00:42:54,708
Invoke your mother's memory

376
00:42:54,791 --> 00:42:58,416
to defend your decision
to betray your own kind?

377
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:01,375
No! It's you that's betrayed our kind!

378
00:43:01,458 --> 00:43:05,291
Squandering our future
so you can cling to the past!

379
00:43:05,375 --> 00:43:07,958
You profane the crown you wear!

380
00:43:50,208 --> 00:43:51,083
Leave it.

381
00:43:54,958 --> 00:43:56,625
It's not yours anymore.

382
00:44:13,916 --> 00:44:16,166
And while he was a snailin'

383
00:44:16,250 --> 00:44:18,541
Upon that autumn day

384
00:44:18,625 --> 00:44:22,416
His babe he left a-wailin'
The stream took her away

385
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:23,958
-Poppy?
-Hmm?

386
00:44:24,041 --> 00:44:25,708
-What are you doin'?

387
00:44:25,791 --> 00:44:27,750
Fetchin' a pail, what's it look like?

388
00:44:27,833 --> 00:44:30,750
No, the vittles. Stop eatin'!
We have to save those.

389
00:44:30,833 --> 00:44:34,625
Why don't you take a look outside,
and then we'll talk.

390
00:44:37,291 --> 00:44:38,125
What...

391
00:44:43,625 --> 00:44:44,875
Look at that! Oh, wow!

392
00:44:44,958 --> 00:44:47,041
We'll go to market
with that crop, won't we?

393
00:44:51,458 --> 00:44:52,541
Here you go.

394
00:44:54,625 --> 00:44:57,750
I don't understand. How?

395
00:44:57,833 --> 00:44:59,083
How do you think?

396
00:45:00,708 --> 00:45:02,125
He fixed it.

397
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,791
Can you believe it, Nori?

398
00:45:05,875 --> 00:45:08,208
There's enough bounty here
to feast tonight

399
00:45:08,291 --> 00:45:11,208
and still have enough left over
to last to Frozen Fish.

400
00:45:11,291 --> 00:45:14,416
Malva's sayin' she gonna make
somethin' called apple-sausage.

401
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:16,500
-Applesauce.
-That's what I said.

402
00:45:30,125 --> 00:45:31,458
From Father.

403
00:45:31,541 --> 00:45:33,833
Thank you, Malva.
Where's your sister gone?

404
00:45:33,916 --> 00:45:36,000
We got it.
Is there more space in there? We're done.

405
00:45:37,833 --> 00:45:41,250
...floated down it
So loudly she did wail

406
00:45:41,333 --> 00:45:43,416
The King of the Frog Fishies

407
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:45,750
Turned her into a snail

408
00:45:46,208 --> 00:45:51,000
Old Bolgerbuck he caught her
So juicy and so sweet

409
00:45:51,083 --> 00:45:55,083
They say his little daughter
He could not help but...

410
00:47:41,958 --> 00:47:43,041
Wait!

411
00:47:45,916 --> 00:47:47,541
You're going the wrong way.

412
00:47:49,791 --> 00:47:51,250
He went that way.

413
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,250
Go on, now.

414
00:48:07,916 --> 00:48:09,125
Nori!

415
00:48:12,166 --> 00:48:14,333
-Leave her alone!
-You heard her.

416
00:48:14,416 --> 00:48:16,333
-Off with you now!
-Begone!

417
00:48:17,375 --> 00:48:20,875
You harm a hair on her foot,
and I'll brain the lot of ya.

418
00:49:35,958 --> 00:49:38,500
Come on. All right.
Keep your hands on.

419
00:49:40,208 --> 00:49:41,041
Together now.

420
00:49:45,833 --> 00:49:46,791
Whoa!

421
00:49:49,416 --> 00:49:50,833
Give him to me.

422
00:49:56,041 --> 00:49:56,875
No!

423
00:49:58,125 --> 00:50:00,541
You're going home. Do you hear me?

424
00:50:01,583 --> 00:50:03,000
You're coming with us.

425
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:13,333
Please. Berek.

426
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:16,750
-Please.
-He won't listen to you.

427
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
He won't listen to any of us.

428
00:50:57,083 --> 00:50:59,666
I should never have
pulled the Elf on board.

429
00:51:02,458 --> 00:51:05,125
I should've left her in the sea,
where I found her.

430
00:52:47,125 --> 00:52:48,541
Theo?

431
00:53:34,833 --> 00:53:38,666
The Queen Regent. Is she here?

432
00:53:45,916 --> 00:53:47,916
Preparations are nearly complete.

433
00:53:49,041 --> 00:53:50,875
We can depart within the hour.

434
00:53:51,458 --> 00:53:53,541
What of the Southlanders?

435
00:53:53,625 --> 00:53:57,625
One garrison will remain behind
to escort them to a safe settlement.

436
00:53:59,541 --> 00:54:01,208
And search for our missing.

437
00:54:12,333 --> 00:54:13,333
Galadriel.

438
00:54:36,916 --> 00:54:38,666
No one kneels in Númenor.

439
00:54:39,791 --> 00:54:41,791
You are not in Númenor.

440
00:54:42,916 --> 00:54:44,916
Neither of you are.

441
00:54:45,625 --> 00:54:48,041
A fault that is mine alone.

442
00:54:48,583 --> 00:54:51,166
Our ships are waiting, my Queen.

443
00:54:53,958 --> 00:54:56,291
Let us put this land behind our sails.

444
00:55:16,916 --> 00:55:19,750
Do not spend your pity on me, Elf.

445
00:55:21,166 --> 00:55:24,166
Save it for our enemies.

446
00:55:26,041 --> 00:55:28,458
For they do not know what they have begun.

447
00:55:37,125 --> 00:55:39,875
For I, Míriel,

448
00:55:40,916 --> 00:55:43,541
daughter of Ar-Inziladûn, vow this.

449
00:55:44,083 --> 00:55:45,833
Númenor will return.

450
00:55:48,541 --> 00:55:51,625
Then the Elves will be ready.

451
00:55:55,208 --> 00:55:58,208
Captain, we sail with the tide.

452
00:56:01,875 --> 00:56:03,125
Captain?

453
00:56:12,250 --> 00:56:13,500
I got it.

454
00:56:31,166 --> 00:56:35,166
On your feet now, girl. Stand up.
Help me gather what we can.

455
00:56:36,958 --> 00:56:38,958
Nori, now.

456
00:56:39,041 --> 00:56:42,000
Don't let this splinter your spirit,
it'll be all right.

457
00:56:42,083 --> 00:56:45,833
Don't lie to her, Largo.
She's too old for that now.

458
00:56:45,916 --> 00:56:48,291
I wasn't lyin'. It will be all right.

459
00:56:48,375 --> 00:56:50,166
Pity's sake, Brandyfoot.

460
00:56:50,250 --> 00:56:52,041
Give us a moment to weep.

461
00:56:52,125 --> 00:56:53,416
Weepin'?

462
00:56:53,875 --> 00:56:56,375
Is that all you think we have left in us?

463
00:56:56,458 --> 00:56:57,958
We're Harfoots!

464
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:11,416
Look, we don't slay dragons.

465
00:57:12,958 --> 00:57:15,041
Not much for diggin' jewels.

466
00:57:15,125 --> 00:57:17,333
But there's one thing we can do,
I warrant,

467
00:57:17,416 --> 00:57:20,375
better than any creature
in all Middle-earth.

468
00:57:22,750 --> 00:57:24,375
We stay true to each other.

469
00:57:26,375 --> 00:57:30,416
No matter how the path winds,
or how steep it gets,

470
00:57:32,166 --> 00:57:33,500
we face it,

471
00:57:34,833 --> 00:57:38,666
with our hearts even bigger than our feet.

472
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:43,166
And we just keep walkin'.

473
00:58:08,875 --> 00:58:11,375
Nori. Where are you goin'?

474
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:15,833
To help my friend.

475
00:58:16,875 --> 00:58:19,875
Warn him what's comin'.
He deserves at least that.

476
00:58:19,958 --> 00:58:23,208
Goin' off-trail? Now? Alone?

477
00:58:23,291 --> 00:58:24,541
She won't be alone.

478
00:58:28,750 --> 00:58:31,833
We've left enough folk behind,
we're not leavin' him.

479
00:58:34,208 --> 00:58:36,416
You girls aren't goin' anywhere.

480
00:58:37,791 --> 00:58:39,625
Not without me.

481
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,833
You sure about this, Goldie?

482
00:58:45,916 --> 00:58:49,750
You go into those woods,
you might never come out alive.

483
00:58:49,833 --> 00:58:53,541
They might if a trail-finder
were to go with them.

484
00:58:55,375 --> 00:58:59,375
Brandyfoot girl was right to help him.
Was right all along.

485
00:58:59,458 --> 00:59:02,958
And if you think Malva Meadowgrass
is too proud to admit it,

486
00:59:03,041 --> 00:59:07,041
well, what's the good of livin', Sadoc,
if we aren't livin' good?

487
00:59:10,916 --> 00:59:14,125
You know, Malva, just once...

488
00:59:14,208 --> 00:59:18,458
Once, it would be grand
if you weren't right all the time.

489
00:59:20,041 --> 00:59:22,375
I'll fetch provisions and get me stick.

490
00:59:23,291 --> 00:59:24,458
I'm comin' with ya.

491
00:59:28,125 --> 00:59:30,500
It doesn't matter anyway,
we're all gonna die.

492
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,666
Come on, otherwise we'll be here all day.

493
00:59:34,750 --> 00:59:36,666
Think we'll be able to find him?

494
00:59:36,750 --> 00:59:39,791
He's a bloody giant.
How could we miss him?

495
01:00:03,708 --> 01:00:05,541
You believe
she'll keep her promise?

496
01:00:06,375 --> 01:00:07,541
No.

497
01:00:08,583 --> 01:00:10,000
I'm certain of it.

498
01:00:11,791 --> 01:00:16,208
Bones have been set,
wounds bound. We can travel.

499
01:00:16,791 --> 01:00:18,708
Where will you go?

500
01:00:18,791 --> 01:00:22,083
An old Númenórean colony
by the mouth of the Anduin.

501
01:00:22,625 --> 01:00:27,541
Pelargir,  they called it.
They say there's fresh land, fresh water.

502
01:00:28,375 --> 01:00:29,875
A fresh start.

503
01:00:32,750 --> 01:00:34,708
Then I will report
to our High King.

504
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
To face whatever awaits me.

505
01:00:40,958 --> 01:00:42,208
But what of our king?

506
01:00:43,583 --> 01:00:44,833
Your king?

507
01:00:45,750 --> 01:00:47,166
Has no one informed you?

508
01:00:47,791 --> 01:00:49,291
Informed me of what?

509
01:00:56,250 --> 01:00:57,416
Halbrand.

510
01:01:00,375 --> 01:01:01,958
I thought you had died.

511
01:01:03,416 --> 01:01:05,500
Better for me if I had done.

512
01:01:07,541 --> 01:01:11,125
Southlanders found him on the road
like this yestereve.

513
01:01:12,666 --> 01:01:14,666
The wound soured overnight.

514
01:01:14,750 --> 01:01:17,208
I thought to try and treat him
on the road, but...

515
01:01:23,875 --> 01:01:25,875
This wound needs Elvish medicine.

516
01:01:27,166 --> 01:01:28,333
Can he ride?

517
01:01:28,416 --> 01:01:31,791
I'll have the healers
gather what provisions they can.

518
01:01:40,625 --> 01:01:42,375
Well, my friend.

519
01:01:43,333 --> 01:01:46,500
It seems fate has in store for us
one more raft.

520
01:01:46,583 --> 01:01:48,291
This is not over.

521
01:01:48,375 --> 01:01:51,791
I will not abandon these lands
and condemn them to burn.

522
01:01:54,083 --> 01:01:55,416
Nor will you.

523
01:02:22,750 --> 01:02:24,083
Strength to the king!

524
01:02:24,833 --> 01:02:28,291
Strength to the king!
Strength to the king!

525
01:02:28,750 --> 01:02:32,666
Strength to the king!
Strength to the king!

526
01:02:32,750 --> 01:02:36,750
Strength to the king!
Strength to the king!

527
01:02:48,583 --> 01:02:51,583
Keep it... Soldier.

528
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:56,166
Commander.

529
01:03:05,583 --> 01:03:07,208
Strength to the Southlands!

530
01:03:07,291 --> 01:03:11,041
Strength to the Southlands!
Strength to the Southlands!

531
01:03:11,125 --> 01:03:13,000
Strength to the Southlands!

532
01:03:13,083 --> 01:03:15,291
Strength to the Southlands!

533
01:03:15,375 --> 01:03:18,375
Strength to the Southlands!

534
01:03:35,125 --> 01:03:36,541
I failed him.

535
01:03:38,958 --> 01:03:41,625
It's all my fault.

536
01:03:43,708 --> 01:03:44,791
No.

537
01:03:45,458 --> 01:03:46,750
No, it isn't.

538
01:03:48,375 --> 01:03:49,875
Whose is it, then?

539
01:03:53,833 --> 01:03:55,000
It's your father's.

540
01:03:56,708 --> 01:04:00,708
He's grown too old, too suspicious.

541
01:04:01,541 --> 01:04:03,958
His mind, too feeble.

542
01:04:04,583 --> 01:04:07,125
His eyes too dim to see

543
01:04:07,250 --> 01:04:10,583
that no matter how many crests
he hurls to the floor,

544
01:04:12,125 --> 01:04:14,791
one day this will be your kingdom.

545
01:04:17,041 --> 01:04:19,041
Durin IV's.

546
01:04:19,125 --> 01:04:20,750
Not your brother's.

547
01:04:22,916 --> 01:04:26,708
Not some other Dwarf-lord's. Yours.

548
01:04:27,916 --> 01:04:29,250
And mine.

549
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:35,958
And together, we will rule this mountain
and all others before our time is done.

550
01:04:39,291 --> 01:04:42,416
That  mithril  belongs to us.

551
01:04:43,625 --> 01:04:45,458
To you and me.

552
01:04:46,375 --> 01:04:48,791
And together, one day,

553
01:04:49,958 --> 01:04:52,208
we are going to dig.

554
01:05:18,833 --> 01:05:23,375
Seal it up.

555
01:05:54,041 --> 01:05:55,291
My children.

556
01:05:56,666 --> 01:05:59,041
Cast off your sun-cloaks and your helms.

557
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,583
You are no longer
to be burdened by the day.

558
01:06:03,958 --> 01:06:05,541
This is our land now.

559
01:06:08,791 --> 01:06:10,208
It is our home.

560
01:06:11,625 --> 01:06:15,333
Hail Adar,
Lord of the Southlands!

561
01:06:15,416 --> 01:06:19,166
Hail Adar,
Lord of the Southlands!

562
01:06:19,291 --> 01:06:22,458
Hail Adar,
Lord of the Southlands!

563
01:06:22,541 --> 01:06:26,000
Hail Adar,
Lord of the Southlands!

564
01:06:27,166 --> 01:06:28,458
No...

565
01:06:30,958 --> 01:06:35,583
That is the name of a place
that no longer exists.

566
01:06:36,541 --> 01:06:39,125
What should we call it instead,
Lord-father?

567
01:06:43,750 --> 01:06:46,375
Adar! Adar!

568
01:06:47,166 --> 01:06:49,791
Adar! Adar!

569
01:06:50,541 --> 01:06:53,208
Adar! Adar!

570
01:06:53,791 --> 01:06:56,500
-Adar! Adar!

571
01:06:56,958 --> 01:06:58,541
Adar!
