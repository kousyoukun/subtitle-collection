1
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:08,870
Whose dagger was it, Galadriel?

2
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:12,290
My brother. He was killed by servants of Sauron.

3
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:17,500
After Morgoth's defeat, the one you call Sauron,

4
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:22,660
he sought to craft a power not of the flesh, but over flesh.

5
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:25,410
I killed Sauron.

6
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,540
I don't believe you.

7
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:30,620
-Dilly, get back!

8
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:39,500
But despite our every effort, our decline has only quickened.

9
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:42,120
This mithril... It is our only salvation.

10
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,620
Nothing diminishes its light.

11
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:46,540
-King Durin... -Enough!

12
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:51,790
I will not risk Dwarven lives to help the Elves cheat death.

13
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:54,540
I'm going to Middle-earth.

14
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:58,250
All that awaits you there is darkness.

15
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:00,160
Take shelter!

16
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,500
Where is my son?

17
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:08,620
Adar! Adar!

18
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:11,370
Let us put this land behind our sails.

19
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:15,450
-Fighting at your side, I felt... -I felt it, too.

20
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:19,120
This wound needs Elvish medicine.

21
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,790
Strength to the king!

22
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:26,410
Where are you goin'?

23
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,120
-Warn him what's comin'. -Alone?

24
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,870
She won't be alone.

25
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:22,500
You're not a peril.

26
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:26,500
You're good.

27
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,080
Nori?

28
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:52,160
We come to serve you, Lord Sauron.

29
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,700
Gil-galad arrives tomorrow,

30
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:01,120
expecting to be presented with a means of saving all Elvendom.

31
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,330
And we have none.

32
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:06,750
If only there was some way...

33
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:12,580
of doing more with less.

34
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:18,750
The Sun itself began as something no bigger than the palm of my hand.

35
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:22,620
And how could we possibly match the powers that wrought the Sun?

36
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:26,540
We're out of time, Celebrimbor.

37
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,660
We must inform the High King of our failure.

38
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:39,120
Then the Elves must prepare to abandon these shores. Forever.

39
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:55,580
Galadriel?

40
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:57,870
Elrond.

41
00:06:58,700 --> 00:06:59,790
-What has happened?

42
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:04,000
-Enemy lance. Six days ago.

43
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:06,040
We rode without rest.

44
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,450
Can you help him?

45
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:19,120
King of the Southlands? How is it your path crossed with his?

46
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:21,450
How is it you are here?

47
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:24,080
How is it you are here?

48
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:31,200
Come. We have much to discuss.

49
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:40,750
I should never have set you on that ship.

50
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:45,410
I should have trusted you. It is a mistake I will not make again.

51
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:53,790
I leapt from that ship...

52
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,540
Because I believed in my heart I was not yet worthy of it.

53
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:04,080
I knew that, somehow, my task here was not yet complete.

54
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:09,750
And when I surfaced, all I could do was swim,

55
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:12,040
and pray I had chosen wisely.

56
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,330
I did not cross that bitter ocean...

57
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,290
Only to drown now.

58
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,580
And nor will I let you.

59
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,870
I have missed you.

60
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:39,750
What are we to do?

61
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,330
The only thing we can do.

62
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,410
Swim.

63
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:58,120
Who's there?

64
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,200
Who's there? Reveal yourself.

65
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,870
Is Galadriel here?

66
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:16,830
No.

67
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:21,160
Shouldn't you be resting?

68
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,200
What is this place?

69
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:28,290
This was the workshop of Celebrimbor.

70
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:30,450
The Celebrimbor?

71
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:33,660
-He's not here, is he?

72
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:37,540
Well... As a matter of fact, he is.

73
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,000
Celebrimbor...

74
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,580
The master I apprenticed to

75
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:57,160
used to speak of the wonders of your craft.

76
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,750
I never dreamed that I'd ever get the chance to see them in person.

77
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:03,040
Are you a smith?

78
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:07,080
Well... Nothing like your artistry.

79
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:13,450
These gemstones, I've never seen anything like them.

80
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:17,450
What do you plan to use them for?

81
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:23,540
F?anor's jewelcraft managed to capture the essence of Valinor.

82
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,250
I had hoped to do the same for Middle-earth.

83
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:30,540
This is a peculiar ore. What is it?

84
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:34,830
Not enough.

85
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:36,750
Enough for what?

86
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:41,370
Please.

87
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:45,540
Have you tried combining it with other ores? To better stretch it out?

88
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:47,950
That wouldn't be suitable for this ore.

89
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,160
-Why not? -Because in the amounts we need,

90
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:53,120
it would too greatly dilute its unique qualities.

91
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:56,700
Forgive me, but, uh, at the risk of sounding a fool,

92
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:59,950
couldn't the right alloy also amplify those qualities?

93
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:03,790
Uh... Amplify?

94
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:07,200
Where I came up, precious metals were scarce as hens' teeth.

95
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:11,870
-So we learnt to combine them to harness strengths and hide flaws.

96
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:17,290
I've seen a trace of nickel added to iron to make a blade lighter and stronger.

97
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:22,370
Might there not be some alloy to amplify the qualities of your ore?

98
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:35,330
Well, that is... an intriguing suggestion.

99
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,660
Call it... a gift.

100
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,450
Soon, he will travel that road which makes an end of every man who walks it.

101
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:58,040
Black flags will fill our harbor.

102
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:02,620
It will be our duty to forge for him a tomb,

103
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:10,620
granting him the immortality in stone that no man,

104
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:16,330
not even a king, can attain in life.

105
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,160
so they can propose a design.

106
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,870
Of all the apprentices,

107
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,870
you have been chosen to propose one as well.

108
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:36,080
In the coming days,

109
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,290
each of you will be granted one hour with the king.

110
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:42,540
Use it well.

111
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,830
I know what you have been doing in the dark of night

112
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:12,660
-when you thought all eyes were asleep. -I'm sorry.

113
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:16,080
Your handmaid will be back in a moment, my king.

114
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,200
Then there is still time.

115
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:24,950
Time for what?

116
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:30,410
-You're mistaken. I'm not... -Queen yet? No.

117
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,910
But you will be. So know this,

118
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,410
if the old ways of our people are not soon restored,

119
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,950
our island will fall.

120
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,370
Help!

121
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:47,370
It's the king! Help!

122
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:00,040
Come. You must go up.

123
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:03,910
But don't do as I did. I looked for too long.

124
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,500
And now, I cannot separate what is from what was,

125
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:09,700
what was from what will be.

126
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:50,830
One object. For all Middle-earth.

127
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:52,750
I know it sounds strange, High King.

128
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:56,000
But surely, we should exhaust every possible solution.

129
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,870
Precisely what manner of object?

130
00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:01,910
It would be smaller than previously imagined.

131
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,750
Something that could be carried...

132
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:04,910
-A scepter perhaps. -A sword?

133
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,700
Or perhaps... A crown.

134
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,120
Why a crown?

135
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,750
A circular form will be ideal.

136
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:17,660
Allowing the light to arc back upon itself in one unbroken round,

137
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:21,790
building to a power that is all but unbounded.

138
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:26,790
And you would place all that power upon the brow of one being?

139
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:29,870
Not just any one being, High King. You.

140
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,580
Perilous are these whisperings...

141
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:38,000
Sometimes the perilous path is the only path.

142
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:40,040
I wouldn't be standing here otherwise.

143
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,200
You should not be standing here at all.

144
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:45,450
High King, we ask only for the time needed

145
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:48,370
to gather the Elven-smiths and test Celebrimbor's theory...

146
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:49,790
Our time runs short.

147
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:52,080
-Yes, that is why... -Shorter than you know.

148
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:58,120
Since the mountain of fire's eruption, the Great Tree is all but bleeding leaves.

149
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,830
Soon, the last will fall.

150
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:05,330
And unless our people leave these shores, so shall we.

151
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:12,120
There is no Elf in Middle-earth who wanted a solution more than I.

152
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:18,750
But if this was to be our salvation, I'm afraid we needed it sooner.

153
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:20,910
But I almost had it sooner.

154
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,910
It was only in speaking with the Southlander that I realized...

155
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,410
The low man? This idea was his?

156
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:30,000
His suggestions were but the key that unlocked the dam.

157
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:34,750
We are on the cusp of crafting a new kind of power.

158
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:37,870
Not of strength, but of spirit.

159
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:40,450
Not of the flesh, but over flesh.

160
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,910
This is...

161
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,540
This is a power of the Unseen World.

162
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:52,500
I am sorry, Lord Celebrimbor.

163
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:56,620
You are hereby commanded to disband the city

164
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:59,700
and return to Lindon immediately.

165
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:01,870
All of you.

166
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:19,830
Those words, "a power over flesh."

167
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,200
Where did you hear them?

168
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:29,750
I was conferring with my smiths. I think I...

169
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,660
-I believe those are my words. -Was Halbrand with you?

170
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:39,830
What does it matter? It's over.

171
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:45,120
High King, wait!

172
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:47,910
-I am sorry... -Grant me three months.

173
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:50,450
I am owed that much.

174
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:53,660
You are owed nothing.

175
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:56,410
Then do it not out of recompense.

176
00:17:58,290 --> 00:17:59,870
Do it because I asked you.

177
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:04,450
It is a fool's hope, Elrond.

178
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:06,580
Merely that. Nothing more.

179
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:12,080
"Hope is never mere. Not even when it is meager."

180
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,370
Or have you forgotten your own counsel?

181
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:13,750
I need royal lineages, bloodlines. Anything you can find on the Southlands.

182
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:16,830
Our records are limited concerning the mortal kingdoms.

183
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:19,660
I'll have to scour the catacombs for that information.

184
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,790
-Come. -Three weeks...

185
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:25,120
Three weeks for a labor that could take three centuries.

186
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,200
Constraint can be the very progenitor of invention.

187
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:32,040
Go. Speak of this to no one.

188
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,910
Don't be afraid.

189
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,080
Celebrimbor will find a way. I'm certain of it.

190
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:44,580
All of a sudden, the two of you seem quite familiar.

191
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:47,330
I'm just offering whatever humble aid I can.

192
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:52,870
To tell you the truth, I can still hardly believe it.

193
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:56,750
Someone like me, here,

194
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:00,620
working with the Elven-smiths of Eregion.

195
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:06,250
Thank you, Galadriel.

196
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,950
For bringing you here?

197
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:11,330
For saving my life.

198
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:15,500
As you saved mine. Our scales are balanced.

199
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:16,910
No.

200
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,580
No, you've done far more than that for me.

201
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:22,620
I'd all but given up.

202
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:26,000
But you, you believed in me.

203
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,950
You saw strength in me.

204
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:31,120
You pushed me to heights that no one else could have.

205
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:34,500
I will never forget that.

206
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:41,500
And I'll see to it that no one else does either.

207
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:03,910
Do not be afraid, master.

208
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:10,200
The more your powers awaken, the more the veil will weaken.

209
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:12,040
Veil?

210
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:17,040
The one placed upon your mind by those who cast you down.

211
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:21,580
But we have come here to welcome you in.

212
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:25,080
To bring you to our lands.

213
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,080
Your lands?

214
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,790
You know them already.

215
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:37,080
The stars.

216
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:40,330
It is called the Hermit's Hat.

217
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:44,620
A pattern visible in but one place.

218
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:50,540
Far to the east, where the stars are strange.

219
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:54,830
The lands of Rh?n.

220
00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:57,870
-Rh?n... -Yes.

221
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:04,540
Where you will be known at last, for who you truly are.

222
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:09,290
You fell from the stars, yet you are greater than they.

223
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:12,120
For fire obeys your will.

224
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:17,040
You fell below the dust, yet dust fears you.

225
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,540
For it trembles when you are wroth.

226
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:24,290
The winds and waters, the heat and cold.

227
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:28,080
In Rh?n, you shall learn to command them all.

228
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:34,160
And every being that walks or crawls shall be your slave.

229
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:38,540
For you are Lord Sauron.

230
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,160
Enough!

231
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:11,620
In time, he will learn to control his powers.

232
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,830
For now, bind him.

233
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,540
What is it?

234
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:41,580
Well, in the grand tradition of bad ideas, this might well be the worst yet.

235
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:43,450
Well, have you got a better notion?

236
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:50,950
Third one's gone.

237
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:53,500
Where'd the third one go?

238
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:56,410
Better two than three. Now's our chance.

239
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:54,580
-Hey!

240
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,120
Brandyfoot! Run!

241
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:06,790
Sadoc!

242
00:25:56,830 --> 00:25:59,660
Master, calm yourself.

243
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:03,540
-Nori. Nori, let's go!

244
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,370
-Come on!

245
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,290
Make him see.

246
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:34,950
Take it.

247
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:37,540
We need you. Please, just take it.

248
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:41,870
Get away from me. Or I wi...

249
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:46,660
I will hurt you. Again.

250
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:49,830
What? What have they done to you?

251
00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:53,330
They showed me what I am.

252
00:28:55,910 --> 00:28:57,910
Only you can show what you are.

253
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:02,000
You choose by what you do.

254
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,620
You're here to help.

255
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:20,830
I know it.

256
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:42,330
Close your eyes. -It'll only hurt but a moment.

257
00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:45,290
No!

258
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:14,290
From shadow you came.

259
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:18,040
To shadow I bid you return!

260
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:22,620
-He is not Sauron. -He is the other. The Istar. He is...

261
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:24,330
I'm good.

262
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:06,870
Nori!

263
00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:19,450
Sadoc?

264
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:32,160
Hold still. We'll find a way to carry you back.

265
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:34,200
Sorry, good lady.

266
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:38,370
I'm afraid I'm about to go a' wandering off-trail.

267
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:42,080
Mr. Burrows...

268
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:44,290
It's all right, Proudfellow.

269
00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:47,910
The missus will be waitin'.

270
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:54,450
Now, if you don't mind, I'd just like to sit a while,

271
00:31:55,790 --> 00:31:57,200
watch the Sun come up.

272
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:16,080
One, two, three,

273
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:20,200
-four, five, six,

274
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:22,660
seven, eight...

275
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,250
It's nine...

276
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:29,200
Stairs to main-post.

277
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,250
You're doing well.

278
00:33:39,330 --> 00:33:42,750
Patronize me like that again, Captain, I'll have your ship.

279
00:33:44,870 --> 00:33:46,290
Come then.

280
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:49,370
I have you.

281
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:57,290
And who has you?

282
00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:03,830
Given your loss,

283
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:09,540
I would understand it if upon our return, you wish to take a leave of duty.

284
00:34:13,910 --> 00:34:18,870
You once asked me why I pulled Galadriel from the sea.

285
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:22,370
I claimed to have had little choice.

286
00:34:23,870 --> 00:34:26,540
But the truth is, I could have left her there.

287
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:29,910
Could've refused to follow her to Middle-earth.

288
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:33,580
Or stopped my son from doing so.

289
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:38,910
Yet at every turn, I made the choices I did because...

290
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:41,790
Why, Elendil?

291
00:34:44,450 --> 00:34:48,410
Because "Elendil" does not merely mean "one who loves the stars."

292
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:52,160
I just never imagined it would lead here.

293
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:09,080
My father once told me that the way of The Faithful

294
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:11,160
is committing to pay the price...

295
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:15,330
Even if the cost cannot be known.

296
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:20,580
And trusting that, in the end, it will be worth it.

297
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:28,790
Sometimes the cost is dear.

298
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,250
It is.

299
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:39,500
We have little choice then but to keep serving.

300
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:47,000
And I, for one, will see to it that we make the end worth the price.

301
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:50,200
Come what may?

302
00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:52,830
Come what may.

303
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:14,200
My Queen.

304
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:45,330
Elendil, what is it? What's wrong?

305
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:52,200
What is it?

306
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:54,950
What do you see?

307
00:37:46,290 --> 00:37:47,540
-What has happened?

308
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:51,830
The mithril is proud.

309
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:57,750
It refuses every effort to bond it with lesser ores.

310
00:37:57,830 --> 00:38:00,500
Tapping into the powers of the Seen and Unseen World

311
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:03,330
seemed to soften the boundaries between the two.

312
00:38:03,410 --> 00:38:04,580
Doesn't make any sense.

313
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:07,370
We used enough pressure to fuse the heavens with earth.

314
00:38:07,450 --> 00:38:10,700
-It should have held this time! -Patience. This is a journey.

315
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:13,660
Not every step we take will be forward. It may take time.

316
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:15,620
-Time? We don't... We don't have time. -Time...

317
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:18,000
Perhaps that is enough for today.

318
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:21,040
Perhaps we've been pushing ourselves too hard.

319
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:23,290
"Pushing ourselves too hard."

320
00:38:28,290 --> 00:38:30,040
Supposing that's the trouble.

321
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:34,290
Supposing we've been using too much force?

322
00:38:34,370 --> 00:38:36,410
Meaning what?

323
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:39,660
Meaning that the metals shouldn't be forced to join...

324
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:43,660
But more drawn or coaxed together.

325
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:47,660
Now, if that's true, we've been... we've been doing it all inside out.

326
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:53,160
Quickly. Dismantle this. We start again.

327
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,200
My lady.

328
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:28,830
Galadriel!

329
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:32,040
We found it.

330
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:34,910
I don't know how we missed it before.

331
00:39:35,410 --> 00:39:37,500
It's too much power for one object.

332
00:39:38,290 --> 00:39:39,620
We need two.

333
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:41,870
We're making two.

334
00:39:41,950 --> 00:39:44,250
-Two crowns? -Not exactly.

335
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:46,620
It'll need to be something...

336
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:48,870
Smaller.

337
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:51,200
Come, see for yourself.

338
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:53,830
Not until you tell me who you are.

339
00:39:55,870 --> 00:39:57,450
You know who I am.

340
00:39:57,540 --> 00:39:59,450
Who you really are.

341
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:03,540
Galadriel, I'm afraid I don't...

342
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:07,290
There is no King of the Southlands.

343
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,580
The line was broken.

344
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:14,160
The last man to bear your crest died over a thousand years ago.

345
00:40:15,290 --> 00:40:16,870
He had no heir.

346
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,580
I told you I found it on a dead man.

347
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:35,910
No.

348
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:38,580
No, on the raft, you saved me...

349
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:40,410
On the raft, you saved me.

350
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:48,660
You fought beside me.

351
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:51,910
Against your enemy. And mine.

352
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:58,120
Tell me your name.

353
00:41:00,870 --> 00:41:04,700
I have been awake since before the breaking of the first silence.

354
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:09,080
In that time... I have had many names.

355
00:41:34,330 --> 00:41:36,330
Lose your footing again, sister?

356
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:42,950
It was just a little tumble, is all.

357
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,080
On your feet now.

358
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:01,580
Get out of my mind.

359
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:03,830
Please, sister.

360
00:42:06,410 --> 00:42:07,790
Look at me.

361
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:10,620
Galadriel.

362
00:42:22,410 --> 00:42:24,040
My old dagger.

363
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:27,790
You've kept it safe all this time.

364
00:42:30,830 --> 00:42:32,830
You have been very brave.

365
00:42:35,410 --> 00:42:39,410
You have fought so hard. For so many years.

366
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:42,950
To complete the task that I could not.

367
00:42:45,370 --> 00:42:47,540
Your task was hunting Sauron.

368
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:52,620
My task was to ensure peace.

369
00:42:54,910 --> 00:42:59,330
But I learned that was Sauron's task as well.

370
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,370
No.

371
00:43:03,870 --> 00:43:05,290
No, you died.

372
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:08,750
Along with countless others, because of him.

373
00:43:08,830 --> 00:43:10,950
No, Galadriel.

374
00:43:12,750 --> 00:43:17,580
He was seeking a power not to destroy Middle-earth,

375
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,160
but to heal it.

376
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:27,620
Just as your fellow Elves are seeking to do this very moment.

377
00:43:29,410 --> 00:43:30,910
You needn't lie to them.

378
00:43:33,370 --> 00:43:35,370
Simply let the work proceed.

379
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:45,290
Do you remember what I whispered to you under this very tree?

380
00:43:51,870 --> 00:43:53,870
Touch the darkness once more.

381
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:12,500
My brother is dead. Because of you.

382
00:44:12,580 --> 00:44:16,410
Galadriel. Why would you say that?

383
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:19,200
Why would you say such a thing?

384
00:44:20,250 --> 00:44:21,500
Galadriel.

385
00:44:23,290 --> 00:44:25,750
Galadriel. Come back to me.

386
00:44:25,830 --> 00:44:28,870
Galadriel. Look at me!

387
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:35,000
Galadriel. Look at me.

388
00:44:39,870 --> 00:44:41,290
You know who I am.

389
00:44:43,620 --> 00:44:44,700
I am your friend.

390
00:44:44,790 --> 00:44:47,200
You are a friend of Morgoth's.

391
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:54,330
When Morgoth was defeated,

392
00:44:56,620 --> 00:45:01,370
it was as if a great, clenched fist

393
00:45:02,790 --> 00:45:05,040
had released its grasp from my neck.

394
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:08,830
And in the stillness of that first sunrise,

395
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:14,160
at last, I felt the light of The One again.

396
00:45:16,620 --> 00:45:20,830
And I knew if ever I was to be forgiven...

397
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:25,700
That I had to heal everything that I had helped ruin.

398
00:45:25,790 --> 00:45:28,450
No penance could ever erase the evil you have done.

399
00:45:28,540 --> 00:45:31,750
-That is not what you believe. -Do not tell me what I believe.

400
00:45:31,830 --> 00:45:33,410
No. You told me.

401
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:38,370
After our victory, you said that whatever I'd done before I could be free of it now.

402
00:45:38,450 --> 00:45:40,830
-You deceived me. -I told you the truth.

403
00:45:40,910 --> 00:45:44,500
I told you that I had done evil, and you did not care.

404
00:45:44,580 --> 00:45:47,950
Because you knew that our past meant nothing,

405
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:49,700
weighed against our future.

406
00:45:50,620 --> 00:45:52,620
There is no such future.

407
00:45:53,910 --> 00:45:55,080
Isn't there?

408
00:46:17,290 --> 00:46:19,290
All others look on you with doubt.

409
00:46:21,870 --> 00:46:23,870
I alone can see your greatness.

410
00:46:28,450 --> 00:46:32,040
I alone can see your light.

411
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:35,910
You would make me a tyrant.

412
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,620
I would make you a queen.

413
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:41,040
Fair as the sea and the Sun.

414
00:46:41,870 --> 00:46:44,450
Stronger than the foundations of the earth.

415
00:46:45,250 --> 00:46:47,830
And you. My king.

416
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:50,790
The Dark Lord.

417
00:46:50,870 --> 00:46:53,870
No. Not dark.

418
00:46:54,950 --> 00:46:56,660
Not with you at my side.

419
00:46:57,950 --> 00:47:01,950
You told me once, that we were brought together for a purpose.

420
00:47:04,290 --> 00:47:05,620
This is it.

421
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:10,370
You bind me to the light. And I bind you to power.

422
00:47:12,620 --> 00:47:16,200
Together, we can save this Middle-earth.

423
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:19,290
Save?

424
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:22,540
Or rule?

425
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:26,330
I see no difference.

426
00:47:29,450 --> 00:47:34,790
And that is why... I will never be at your side.

427
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:40,750
You have no choice.

428
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:43,290
Without me, your people will fade.

429
00:47:43,370 --> 00:47:46,580
And the shadow will spread and darken to cover all the world.

430
00:47:46,660 --> 00:47:49,250
-You need me. -I should have left you on the sea.

431
00:47:49,330 --> 00:47:51,790
A sea you were on because the Elves cast you out.

432
00:47:51,870 --> 00:47:56,290
They cast you out for deigning to beg them for a few petty soldiers.

433
00:47:56,370 --> 00:47:59,870
What will they do when you tell them that you were my ally?

434
00:47:59,950 --> 00:48:04,540
When you tell them that Sauron lives because of you?

435
00:48:04,620 --> 00:48:06,370
And you will die because of me.

436
00:48:42,660 --> 00:48:44,250
Galadriel!

437
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:52,000
Deceiver!

438
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:55,370
-Galadriel, stop! Elrond. It's Elrond.

439
00:48:55,450 --> 00:48:56,500
Prove it.

440
00:48:58,750 --> 00:49:00,160
Where did we first meet?

441
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:03,790
Seaside. When I was first orphaned.

442
00:49:04,790 --> 00:49:08,540
I was alone. A young, half-elven boy, without friend or kin.

443
00:49:11,620 --> 00:49:13,120
You gave me water.

444
00:49:17,660 --> 00:49:18,910
Elrond.

445
00:49:26,290 --> 00:49:29,200
Celebrimbor. Where is he?

446
00:49:29,290 --> 00:49:32,660
Workshop. He'll almost be finished by now.

447
00:49:32,750 --> 00:49:34,000
No!

448
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:37,250
Galadriel! Galadriel! What has happened?

449
00:49:42,540 --> 00:49:43,620
Galadriel!

450
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:50,700
-Is it done?

451
00:49:50,790 --> 00:49:53,410
Galadriel. You're as wet as a river rock.

452
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:54,580
Why?

453
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:57,580
Because I pulled her from the waters of Glanduin.

454
00:49:57,660 --> 00:49:59,620
The Glanduin? What happened?

455
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:00,950
Galadriel?

456
00:50:04,250 --> 00:50:05,750
Where is Halbrand?

457
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:11,620
He is gone. And I doubt he will return.

458
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:16,080
And should he ever, none of us are to treat with him again.

459
00:50:17,330 --> 00:50:19,410
What happened by that stream?

460
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:21,500
You spoke to me once of a mistake.

461
00:50:22,790 --> 00:50:24,750
One you said you would not make again.

462
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:28,750
You're making that promise very difficult to keep.

463
00:50:28,830 --> 00:50:31,910
Were it easy, it would not require trust.

464
00:50:39,370 --> 00:50:41,290
So, do we proceed?

465
00:50:41,370 --> 00:50:42,250
No.

466
00:50:44,950 --> 00:50:46,950
We must make three.

467
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:48,870
Three? Why three?

468
00:50:50,790 --> 00:50:54,620
One will always corrupt. Two will divide.

469
00:50:54,750 --> 00:50:57,580
But with three, there is balance.

470
00:51:03,370 --> 00:51:08,370
The powers we forge today must be for the Elves alone.

471
00:51:09,410 --> 00:51:11,410
Untouched by other hands.

472
00:51:12,660 --> 00:51:16,540
Galadriel, I have determined that the purity

473
00:51:16,620 --> 00:51:19,700
of the lesser ores in the alloy is crucial.

474
00:51:22,250 --> 00:51:25,660
I need gold and silver of the most exquisite quality.

475
00:51:27,790 --> 00:51:29,950
I need gold and silver from Valinor.

476
00:51:34,450 --> 00:51:38,870
True creation requires... sacrifice.

477
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:49,160
Do you remember anything more yet?

478
00:51:50,290 --> 00:51:53,700
Fragments. Impressions.

479
00:51:55,330 --> 00:52:00,000
More has come. But to discover the rest, I know I must go to Rh?n.

480
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:04,790
They were wrong about your name.

481
00:52:04,870 --> 00:52:08,370
What if they're wrong about that, too? Or lying, or...

482
00:52:08,450 --> 00:52:13,950
What they said, I knew to be true with a... a certainty that I can't explain.

483
00:52:17,290 --> 00:52:18,500
They, um...

484
00:52:19,330 --> 00:52:22,080
They called you something else. "Istar."

485
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:24,500
Is that your kind?

486
00:52:26,540 --> 00:52:27,790
"Istar?"

487
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:33,330
In your tongue, that means "wise one."

488
00:52:34,410 --> 00:52:35,250
Or...

489
00:52:38,450 --> 00:52:39,790
"Wizard."

490
00:52:51,410 --> 00:52:53,830
You're really not coming with us, are ya?

491
00:52:59,620 --> 00:53:04,080
Betimes, our paths are laid before us by powers greater than our own.

492
00:53:04,750 --> 00:53:07,620
In those moments, it's our task to make our feet go

493
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:10,950
where our hearts wish not to tread.

494
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:14,000
No matter the perils awaiting us on the way.

495
00:53:16,870 --> 00:53:19,500
-Sounds a bit like an adventure. -Oh.

496
00:53:19,580 --> 00:53:21,250
Alone, it's just a journey.

497
00:53:22,580 --> 00:53:26,000
Now adventures, they must be shared.

498
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:36,910
Think I've had about as much adventure as any Harfoot could ever hope for.

499
00:53:49,750 --> 00:53:53,080
Says here, if we go north-ways,

500
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:56,660
we have thirty days of clear trail.

501
00:53:56,790 --> 00:53:58,870
All fresh grass and no trolls.

502
00:53:59,950 --> 00:54:04,410
-Hey, hey, hey! -All downhill, look like... -You're holding it upside down.

503
00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:11,500
Sorry, Malva. Nothing but steep slopes and brickle-brambles for weeks.

504
00:54:11,580 --> 00:54:15,000
Well, if you're so quick and wise, why don't you do the trail-finding?

505
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:22,160
Watch out for little ones and stragglers.

506
00:54:22,250 --> 00:54:24,830
Nobody goes off-trail!

507
00:54:24,910 --> 00:54:27,750
And nobody walks alone!

508
00:54:27,830 --> 00:54:30,250
Sounded better when Sadoc said it.

509
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:36,620
Wish the old goat were still with us.

510
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:37,910
He is.

511
00:54:50,410 --> 00:54:51,250
Go on.

512
00:54:55,620 --> 00:54:58,080
You're a part of something bigger now.

513
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:01,370
He needs ya.

514
00:55:02,580 --> 00:55:04,750
And you belong out there.

515
00:55:19,410 --> 00:55:20,750
Good-bye, Nori!

516
00:55:20,870 --> 00:55:22,290
-Good-bye... -Be careful!

517
00:55:26,620 --> 00:55:27,450
Be well.

518
00:55:37,950 --> 00:55:40,200
-Did you pack your lantern? -Of course.

519
00:55:40,290 --> 00:55:41,370
Good.

520
00:55:42,410 --> 00:55:46,000
Well... Goodbye.

521
00:55:49,870 --> 00:55:50,700
Nori...

522
00:55:53,450 --> 00:55:55,790
Right. Here's snails for the big fella.

523
00:55:55,870 --> 00:55:57,750
-You know how hungry he gets.

524
00:55:57,830 --> 00:56:01,330
And an extra blanket in case you get cold. Right.

525
00:56:02,750 --> 00:56:03,910
Let's see ya.

526
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:12,330
Some father.

527
00:56:13,870 --> 00:56:18,200
Here you're heading into the big beyond and I haven't taught you a bloomin' thing.

528
00:56:18,290 --> 00:56:20,450
Oh. Hey. Sure you have.

529
00:56:23,250 --> 00:56:26,370
Always quench your fire with water and earth.

530
00:56:26,450 --> 00:56:30,540
Don't squat by a river. Never know when you'll need a drink downstream.

531
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:35,830
And a Harfoot without manners is as like to get far in life as a square wheel.

532
00:56:35,910 --> 00:56:37,080
Square wheel...

533
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:42,540
I was listening to all of it, Father.

534
00:56:59,250 --> 00:57:03,750
Find where the river runs. Where the sparrows learn their songs.

535
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:08,870
I will, Mother.

536
00:57:09,620 --> 00:57:10,830
And I'll be careful.

537
00:57:15,620 --> 00:57:16,790
No.

538
00:57:22,250 --> 00:57:24,250
You'll be bold.

539
00:57:48,410 --> 00:57:51,700
Oh, go on. Go on.

540
00:57:51,790 --> 00:57:53,250
Go on. Before you lose your nerve.

541
00:57:55,250 --> 00:57:56,870
Or we lose ours.

542
00:58:08,250 --> 00:58:11,330
Wait! Nori!

543
00:58:11,410 --> 00:58:12,580
Poppy!

544
00:58:24,450 --> 00:58:28,120
Why does everyone I love the most always have to go away?

545
00:58:29,910 --> 00:58:33,950
'Cause I think if we didn't, then we'd never learn anything new.

546
00:58:40,250 --> 00:58:42,830
You'll come back? Promise?

547
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:47,500
-You promise to look after everyone? -Course I will, ankle-head.

548
00:58:50,290 --> 00:58:54,160
You're my best friend in this whole wide, wild world.

549
00:58:54,950 --> 00:58:56,370
I'd do anything for ya.

550
00:58:58,370 --> 00:59:02,620
The world's not that wide, Poppy. It's just that we're so bleedin' small.

551
00:59:08,450 --> 00:59:10,450
Stick close to that tall fella.

552
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
He's a good friend in a spot.

553
00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:14,500
Not so good as you.

554
00:59:45,950 --> 00:59:48,200
-Are you certain? -More than ever.

555
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
Well, they're all waving at you.

556
00:59:52,790 --> 00:59:56,040
If I turn around, I won't ever be able to leave.

557
00:59:57,410 --> 01:00:01,410
Well, then perhaps it would be best if you lead off.

558
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:09,200
Uh, now that it comes to it, my feet feel heavy as iron.

559
01:00:11,540 --> 01:00:14,830
Not to mention, I haven't an inkling which way to go.

560
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:28,410
There it is.

561
01:00:29,910 --> 01:00:31,540
Are you sure?

562
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:33,620
Not entirely.

563
01:00:34,540 --> 01:00:37,040
There's a sweet smell on the air this way.

564
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:43,200
When in doubt, Elanor Brandyfoot...

565
01:00:45,620 --> 01:00:47,330
always follow your nose.

566
01:07:23,120 --> 01:07:27,500
Three rings for the Elven-kings

567
01:07:27,580 --> 01:07:31,910
Under the sky

568
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:35,290
Seven for the Dwarf-lords

569
01:07:35,370 --> 01:07:40,580
In their halls of stone

570
01:07:40,660 --> 01:07:45,120
Nine for Mortal Men

571
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:49,450
Doomed to die

572
01:07:49,540 --> 01:07:52,790
One for the Dark Lord

573
01:07:52,870 --> 01:07:57,080
On his dark throne

574
01:07:57,160 --> 01:08:03,040
In the Land of Mordor

575
01:08:03,910 --> 01:08:09,910
Where the Shadows lie

576
01:08:12,620 --> 01:08:18,620
Where the Shadows lie

577
01:08:27,330 --> 01:08:32,000
One Ring to rule them all

578
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:37,000
One Ring to find them

579
01:08:37,080 --> 01:08:42,160
One Ring to bring them all

580
01:08:42,250 --> 01:08:48,250
And in the darkness Bind them

581
01:08:52,250 --> 01:08:58,250
In the Land of Mordor

582
01:09:01,410 --> 01:09:07,410
Where the Shadows lie...

583
01:09:10,160 --> 01:09:16,160
Where the Shadows lie...
