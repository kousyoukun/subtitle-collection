1
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:08,870
加拉德瑞尔 那把短剑是谁的
Whose dagger was it, Galadriel?

2
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:12,290
我哥哥 他被索隆的仆从杀害了
My brother. He was killed by servants of Sauron.

3
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:17,500
魔苟斯战败后 你们称之为索隆的那一位
After Morgoth's defeat, the one you call Sauron,

4
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:22,660
试图打造一种力量 并非来源于肉体 而是让肉体受控于它
he sought to craft a power not of the flesh, but over flesh.

5
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:25,410
我杀了索隆
I killed Sauron.

6
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,540
我不信你
I don't believe you.

7
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:29,040
活下来
á kuita!

8
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:30,620
迪莉 快回来
-Dilly, get back!

9
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:39,500
但尽管我们竭尽全力 枯萎还是加速了
But despite our every effort, our decline has only quickened.

10
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:42,120
这个秘银…是我们唯一的救赎
This mithril... It is our only salvation.

11
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,620
任何事物都无法削弱它的光
Nothing diminishes its light.

12
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:46,540
-都林国王… -够了
-King Durin... -Enough!

13
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:51,790
所以我不会拿矮人们的生命冒险 去帮助精灵逃避死亡
I will not risk Dwarven lives to help the Elves cheat death.

14
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:54,540
我要去中洲
I'm going to Middle-earth.

15
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:58,250
在那里等待你的将是黑暗
All that awaits you there is darkness.

16
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:00,160
快找掩护
Take shelter!

17
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:04,700
不

18
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,500
我儿子在哪里
Where is my son?

19
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:08,620
阿达尔
Adar! Adar!

20
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:11,370
我们离开这片大陆吧
Let us put this land behind our sails.

21
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:15,450
-与你并肩作战 我感觉… -我也感觉到了
-Fighting at your side, I felt... -I felt it, too.

22
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:19,120
这个伤口需要精灵族的药
This wound needs Elvish medicine.

23
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,790
赐国王以力量
Strength to the king!

24
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:26,410
你要去哪
Where are you goin'?

25
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,120
-警告他将要发生的事情 -独自前往
-Warn him what's comin'. -Alone?

26
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,870
她不会独行的
She won't be alone.

27
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:53,660
大绿林

28
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:22,500
你不是危险
You're not a peril.

29
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:26,500
你很好
You're good.

30
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,080
诺瑞
Nori?

31
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:52,160
我们前来为您效劳 索隆大君
We come to serve you, Lord Sauron.

32
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:24,370
指环王：力量之戒
第一季第八集

33
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:24,370
本WEB版外挂字幕由  风吹来的那片云  双语合并

34
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,700
吉尔加拉德明天到达
Gil-galad arrives tomorrow,

35
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:01,120
等着我们汇报 能够拯救所有精灵王国的方法
expecting to be presented with a means of saving all Elvendom.

36
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,330
而我们却一筹莫展
And we have none.

37
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:06,750
要是能有某种方式…
If only there was some way...

38
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:12,580
能够事半功倍就好了
of doing more with less.

39
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:18,750
太阳刚诞生的时候 还没有我的巴掌大
The Sun itself began as something no bigger than the palm of my hand.

40
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:22,620
我们的力量 怎么能与太阳的创造者相提并论
And how could we possibly match the powers that wrought the Sun?

41
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:26,540
我们没时间了 凯勒布林博
We're out of time, Celebrimbor.

42
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,660
必须告知至高王我们失败了
We must inform the High King of our failure.

43
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:39,120
接下来精灵必须 做好准备 永久放弃这片海岸
Then the Elves must prepare to abandon these shores. Forever.

44
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:55,580
加拉德瑞尔
Galadriel?

45
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:57,870
埃尔隆德
Elrond.

46
00:06:58,700 --> 00:06:59,790
出什么事了
-What has happened?

47
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:04,000
六天前 他被敌人的长矛刺中了
-Enemy lance. Six days ago.

48
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:06,040
我们马不停蹄地赶了过来
We rode without rest.

49
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,450
你能救救他吗
Can you help him?

50
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:14,410
快醒来吧…
á tul? koivienna...

51
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:19,120
南方大地的国王  你怎么会和他有交集呢
King of the Southlands? How is it your path crossed with his?

52
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:21,450
你怎么会在这里
How is it you are here?

53
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:24,080
你怎么会在这里
How is it you are here?

54
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:31,200
走吧 我们有很多事情要谈
Come. We have much to discuss.

55
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:40,750
我当初就不应该让你上那艘船
I should never have set you on that ship.

56
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:45,410
我本应该相信你的 这种错误我以后不会再犯了
I should have trusted you. It is a mistake I will not make again.

57
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:53,790
我从那艘船上跳下来…
I leapt from that ship...

58
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,540
因为我深知自己还不配重返维林诺
Because I believed in my heart I was not yet worthy of it.

59
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:04,080
我就是知道 不知何故 自己在这里的任务还没有完成
I knew that, somehow, my task here was not yet complete.

60
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:09,750
等我浮出水面时 我能做的只有拼命游泳
And when I surfaced, all I could do was swim,

61
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:12,040
并祈祷自己做了明智之选
and pray I had chosen wisely.

62
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,330
我当初游过那片苦海…
I did not cross that bitter ocean...

63
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,290
可不是为了现在功败垂成
Only to drown now.

64
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,580
所以我也不能让你失败
And nor will I let you.

65
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,870
我想你了
I have missed you.

66
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:39,750
我们接下来怎么做
What are we to do?

67
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,330
做我们唯一能做的
The only thing we can do.

68
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,410
使劲地游
Swim.

69
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:58,120
是谁在那儿
Who's there?

70
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,200
是谁在那儿 出来
Who's there? Reveal yourself.

71
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,870
加拉德瑞尔在这里吗
Is Galadriel here?

72
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:16,830
不在
No.

73
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:21,160
你不是在休息吗
Shouldn't you be resting?

74
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,200
这是什么地方
What is this place?

75
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:28,290
这里曾是凯勒布林博的工作间
This was the workshop of Celebrimbor.

76
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:30,450
就是那位凯勒布林博吗
The Celebrimbor?

77
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:33,660
他不会在这里吧
-He's not here, is he?

78
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:37,540
这个嘛…其实 他就在这里
Well... As a matter of fact, he is.

79
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,000
凯勒布林博…
Celebrimbor...

80
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,580
我师从的那位大师
The master I apprenticed to

81
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:57,160
以前经常说起你无与伦比的手艺
used to speak of the wonders of your craft.

82
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,750
我未曾想过自己能有机会亲眼所见
I never dreamed that I'd ever get the chance to see them in person.

83
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:03,040
你是铁匠吗
Are you a smith?

84
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:07,080
这个…我跟您可没法相提并论
Well... Nothing like your artistry.

85
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:13,450
这些宝石 我从未见过
These gemstones, I've never seen anything like them.

86
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:17,450
你打算用它们做什么
What do you plan to use them for?

87
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:23,540
费艾诺的珠宝工艺 成功地捕捉到了维林诺的圣光
F?anor's jewelcraft managed to capture the essence of Valinor.

88
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,250
我希望能在中洲如法炮制
I had hoped to do the same for Middle-earth.

89
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:30,540
这种矿石很奇特 它是什么
This is a peculiar ore. What is it?

90
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:34,830
不够
Not enough.

91
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:36,750
够干什么
Enough for what?

92
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:41,370
请还给我吧
Please.

93
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:45,540
你有没有试过将它 和其他矿石结合 更好地发挥潜能
Have you tried combining it with other ores? To better stretch it out?

94
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:47,950
这种矿石不适合这样做
That wouldn't be suitable for this ore.

95
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,160
-为什么不行  -因为所需数量庞大
-Why not? -Because in the amounts we need,

96
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:53,120
这样会大幅稀释其独一无二的品质
it would too greatly dilute its unique qualities.

97
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:56,700
我的问题可能会有点蠢 请见谅
Forgive me, but, uh, at the risk of sounding a fool,

98
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:59,950
恰当的合金组合 难道不是能强化这些品质吗
couldn't the right alloy also amplify those qualities?

99
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:03,790
强化
Uh... Amplify?

100
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:07,200
在我练手艺的地方 贵重金属简直是凤毛麟角
Where I came up, precious metals were scarce as hens' teeth.

101
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:11,870
所以我们学会了 将各种金属结合 从而扬长避短
-So we learnt to combine them to harness strengths and hide flaws.

102
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:17,290
我曾见过在铁中 添加微量的镍 使刀锋更轻 更坚固
I've seen a trace of nickel added to iron to make a blade lighter and stronger.

103
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:22,370
你的这种矿石 难道没有合金能强化它的品质吗
Might there not be some alloy to amplify the qualities of your ore?

104
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:35,330
你这个建议有点意思
Well, that is... an intriguing suggestion.

105
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,660
称之为…天赋吧
Call it... a gift.

106
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,450
很快 他将踏上 那条所有人都会踏上的归途
Soon, he will travel that road which makes an end of every man who walks it.

107
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:58,040
港口将会一片悲恸
Black flags will fill our harbor.

108
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:02,620
我们有责任为他建造一座坟墓
It will be our duty to forge for him a tomb,

109
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:10,620
用石头赋予他不朽之身
granting him the immortality in stone that no man,

110
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:16,330
这种不朽 任何人 任何国王都无法获得
not even a king, can attain in life.

111
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:23,080
已经召集了努门诺尔 各地的绘图员前来描绘国王的容貌
Draftsmen from across Númenor have been summoned to capture his visage,

112
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,160
好让他们给出一个图样方案
so they can propose a design.

113
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,870
在所有的学徒之中
Of all the apprentices,

114
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,870
你也要提出一项图样方案
you have been chosen to propose one as well.

115
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:36,080
在接下来的日子里
In the coming days,

116
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,290
你们每个人 都将获准与国王相处一小时
each of you will be granted one hour with the king.

117
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:42,540
好好利用这段时间
Use it well.

118
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,830
我知道黑夜里你一直在做什么
I know what you have been doing in the dark of night

119
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:12,660
-你以为大家都睡着了 -对不起
-when you thought all eyes were asleep. -I'm sorry.

120
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:16,080
您的侍女马上就会回来 国王大人
Your handmaid will be back in a moment, my king.

121
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,200
那么还有时间
Then there is still time.

122
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:24,950
还有时间干什么
Time for what?

123
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,540
有时间警告你 年轻的弥瑞尔
To warn you, young Míriel.

124
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:30,410
-您搞错了 我不是… -还不是女王吗 没关系
-You're mistaken. I'm not... -Queen yet? No.

125
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,910
但你会成为女王的 所以听好了
But you will be. So know this,

126
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,410
如果不能尽快恢复 我们与精灵族往日的交好与联盟
if the old ways of our people are not soon restored,

127
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,950
我们的岛屿将会陷落
our island will fall.

128
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,370
救命
Help!

129
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:47,370
是国王 救命
It's the king! Help!

130
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:00,040
过来吧 你必须得走上去
Come. You must go up.

131
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:03,910
但别像我那样找寻了太久
But don't do as I did. I looked for too long.

132
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,500
现在 我已分不清现在与过去
And now, I cannot separate what is from what was,

133
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:09,700
也分不清过去与未来
what was from what will be.

134
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:50,830
整个中洲 仰赖一物
One object. For all Middle-earth.

135
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:52,750
至高王 我知道这听起来很奇怪
I know it sounds strange, High King.

136
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:56,000
但可以肯定 我们穷尽了所有可能的解决方案
But surely, we should exhaust every possible solution.

137
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,870
究竟是什么样的物品
Precisely what manner of object?

138
00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:01,910
它会比之前想象的要小
It would be smaller than previously imagined.

139
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,750
是可以随身携带的物品…
Something that could be carried...

140
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:04,910
-一把权杖 -一把剑
-A scepter perhaps. -A sword?

141
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,700
或者是…一顶王冠
Or perhaps... A crown.

142
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,120
为什么是王冠
Why a crown?

143
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,750
环形会是理想之选
A circular form will be ideal.

144
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:17,660
在完整的环状物中 光线能在弧形里折射回自身
Allowing the light to arc back upon itself in one unbroken round,

145
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:21,790
打造出一种近乎无限的力量
building to a power that is all but unbounded.

146
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:26,790
而你要把这所有力量 都集中在一个精灵的头顶之上吗
And you would place all that power upon the brow of one being?

147
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:29,870
不是随便哪个精灵 而是您啊至高王
Not just any one being, High King. You.

148
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,580
这些悄声暗示危险得很…
Perilous are these whisperings...

149
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:38,000
有的时候 危险的那条道路才是唯一的出路
Sometimes the perilous path is the only path.

150
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:40,040
否则我也不会站在这里
I wouldn't be standing here otherwise.

151
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,200
你本来就不应该在这里
You should not be standing here at all.

152
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:45,450
至高王 我们只求给够时间
High King, we ask only for the time needed

153
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:48,370
召集精灵巧匠 测试凯勒布林博的理论…
to gather the Elven-smiths and test Celebrimbor's theory...

154
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:49,790
我们的时间不多了
Our time runs short.

155
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:52,080
-没错 所以… -时间比你们了解的还要紧张
-Yes, that is why... -Shorter than you know.

156
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:58,120
自从南方大地的火山爆发后 大树的枝叶就开始疯狂掉落
Since the mountain of fire's eruption, the Great Tree is all but bleeding leaves.

157
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,830
很快 最后一片树叶也将凋落
Soon, the last will fall.

158
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:05,330
除非我们的人民 离开这片海岸 否则我们也将衰亡
And unless our people leave these shores, so shall we.

159
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:12,120
中洲没有哪个精灵 比我更迫切想要找出解决方案了
There is no Elf in Middle-earth who wanted a solution more than I.

160
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:18,750
但如果这真能拯救我们 恐怕还得再快一点
But if this was to be our salvation, I'm afraid we needed it sooner.

161
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:20,910
我本来差点就完成了
But I almost had it sooner.

162
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,910
只不过因为 和那个来自南方大地的人说话…
It was only in speaking with the Southlander that I realized...

163
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,410
那个下等人 这个主意是他的
The low man? This idea was his?

164
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:30,000
正是他的建议 才让我想出了这个解决方法
His suggestions were but the key that unlocked the dam.

165
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:34,750
我们眼看着就要打造出一股新的力量
We are on the cusp of crafting a new kind of power.

166
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:37,870
不是物理力量 而是精神力量
Not of strength, but of spirit.

167
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:40,450
并非来源于肉体 而是让肉体受控于它
Not of the flesh, but over flesh.

168
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,910
这是…
This is...

169
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,540
这是不可见世界的力量
This is a power of the Unseen World.

170
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:52,500
我很抱歉 领主凯勒布林博
I am sorry, Lord Celebrimbor.

171
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:56,620
特此命令你解散这座城市
You are hereby commanded to disband the city

172
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:59,700
并立即返回林顿
and return to Lindon immediately.

173
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:01,870
你们大家都是如此
All of you.

174
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:19,830
那句话 “控制肉体的力量”
Those words, "a power over flesh."

175
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,200
你是从哪里听到的
Where did you hear them?

176
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:29,750
我刚才在和巧匠们商议 我觉得…
I was conferring with my smiths. I think I...

177
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,660
-那句是我的原话 -哈尔布兰德刚才和你在一起吗
-I believe those are my words. -Was Halbrand with you?

178
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:39,830
重要吗 反正已经结束了
What does it matter? It's over.

179
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:45,120
至高王 等等
High King, wait!

180
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:47,910
-抱歉… -给我三个月时间
-I am sorry... -Grant me three months.

181
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:50,450
你欠我三个月
I am owed that much.

182
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:53,660
我什么都不欠你的
You are owed nothing.

183
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:56,410
那就别为了补偿我而答应
Then do it not out of recompense.

184
00:17:58,290 --> 00:17:59,870
看在我求您的份上 答应我
Do it because I asked you.

185
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:04,450
这是虚假的希望 埃尔隆德
It is a fool's hope, Elrond.

186
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:06,580
仅此而已 再无更多
Merely that. Nothing more.

187
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:12,080
“希望从来都不是 微不足道的 即便希望很渺茫”
"Hope is never mere. Not even when it is meager."

188
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,370
难道说你已经忘了自己的忠告
Or have you forgotten your own counsel?

189
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:13,750
我要找皇室血脉的记录 要找出与南方大地有关的一切
I need royal lineages, bloodlines. Anything you can find on the Southlands.

190
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:16,830
我们对凡人王国的记录有限
Our records are limited concerning the mortal kingdoms.

191
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:19,660
这些信息我得去地下墓穴里找
I'll have to scour the catacombs for that information.

192
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,790
-躲起来 -三个星期…
-Come. -Three weeks...

193
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:25,120
这工作耗时三个世纪 却只给我三个星期
Three weeks for a labor that could take three centuries.

194
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,200
紧迫的时间就是发明的动力
Constraint can be the very progenitor of invention.

195
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:32,040
去吧 别对任何人提起此事
Go. Speak of this to no one.

196
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,910
别害怕
Don't be afraid.

197
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,080
凯勒布林博会找到办法的 我很确定
Celebrimbor will find a way. I'm certain of it.

198
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:44,580
怎么突然之间你们俩彼此这么熟悉
All of a sudden, the two of you seem quite familiar.

199
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:47,330
我只是尽己所能 提供一些微不足道的帮助而已
I'm just offering whatever humble aid I can.

200
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:52,870
说实话 我还是不敢相信
To tell you the truth, I can still hardly believe it.

201
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:56,750
像我这样的人居然能在这里
Someone like me, here,

202
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:00,620
与埃瑞吉安的精灵巧匠共事
working with the Elven-smiths of Eregion.

203
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:06,250
谢谢你 加拉德瑞尔
Thank you, Galadriel.

204
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,950
谢谢我把你带来
For bringing you here?

205
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:11,330
谢谢你救了我的命
For saving my life.

206
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:15,500
你也救过我 我们互不相欠
As you saved mine. Our scales are balanced.

207
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:16,910
不
No.

208
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,580
不 你为我做的远不止这些
No, you've done far more than that for me.

209
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:22,620
我差点就放弃了
I'd all but given up.

210
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:26,000
但是你选择了相信我
But you, you believed in me.

211
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,950
你在我身上看到了力量
You saw strength in me.

212
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:31,120
你把我拔高到了 其他人无法帮我实现的高度
You pushed me to heights that no one else could have.

213
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:34,500
这一点我永远不会忘却
I will never forget that.

214
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:41,500
我会确保其他人也永远铭记
And I'll see to it that no one else does either.

215
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:03,910
主人 别害怕
Do not be afraid, master.

216
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:10,200
您的力量越觉醒 迷雾就会越弱
The more your powers awaken, the more the veil will weaken.

217
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:12,040
迷雾
Veil?

218
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:17,040
就是那些打败您的人 在您的脑海中设下的障碍
The one placed upon your mind by those who cast you down.

219
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:21,580
但我们前来就是为了欢迎您的回归
But we have come here to welcome you in.

220
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:25,080
将您接回我们的领土
To bring you to our lands.

221
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,080
你们的领土
Your lands?

222
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,790
您其实已经知道了
You know them already.

223
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:37,080
那些星星
The stars.

224
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:40,330
它叫做隐士之帽
It is called the Hermit's Hat.

225
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:44,620
只在一个地方能看到这个星座图案
A pattern visible in but one place.

226
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:50,540
遥远的东方 那里的星座图案很奇怪
Far to the east, where the stars are strange.

227
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:54,830
鲁恩之地
The lands of Rh?n.

228
00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:57,870
-鲁恩… -没错
-Rh?n... -Yes.

229
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:04,540
您的真实身份 最终将在那里为众人所知
Where you will be known at last, for who you truly are.

230
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:09,290
您从星空坠入凡间 但却比星星更加伟大
You fell from the stars, yet you are greater than they.

231
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:12,120
因为火会服从您的意志
For fire obeys your will.

232
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:17,040
您倒在凡尘之下 而凡尘却惧怕于您
You fell below the dust, yet dust fears you.

233
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,540
因为您若发怒 凡尘皆颤抖
For it trembles when you are wroth.

234
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:24,290
风和水 冷与热
The winds and waters, the heat and cold.

235
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:28,080
您将在鲁恩学会控制所有这些力量
In Rh?n, you shall learn to command them all.

236
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:34,160
每一个行走或爬行的生物 都将成为您的奴隶
And every being that walks or crawls shall be your slave.

237
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:38,540
-因为您是索隆大君 -因为您是索隆大君
For you are Lord Sauron.

238
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,160
够了
Enough!

239
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:11,620
假以时日 他将学会控制自己的力量
In time, he will learn to control his powers.

240
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,830
但现在 暂时先把他绑起来
For now, bind him.

241
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,540
怎么了
What is it?

242
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:41,580
我们确实有出馊主意的“优良”传统 但这回恐怕是最馊的一次了
Well, in the grand tradition of bad ideas, this might well be the worst yet.

243
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:43,450
难道你有更好的想法吗
Well, have you got a better notion?

244
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:50,950
第三个居住者不见了
Third one's gone.

245
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:53,500
他去哪了
Where'd the third one go?

246
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:56,410
两个总比三个强 现在就是我们的机会
Better two than three. Now's our chance.

247
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:54,580
嘿
-Hey!

248
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,120
白兰地足 快跑
Brandyfoot! Run!

249
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:06,790
萨道克
Sadoc!

250
00:25:56,830 --> 00:25:59,660
主人 冷静下来
Master, calm yourself.

251
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:03,540
诺瑞 我们走
-Nori. Nori, let's go!

252
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,370
快走
-Come on!

253
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,290
让他睁开眼看
Make him see.

254
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:34,950
拿着它
Take it.

255
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:37,540
我们需要你 求你了 拿着吧
We need you. Please, just take it.

256
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:41,870
离我远点 否则我…
Get away from me. Or I wi...

257
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:46,660
我会再次伤害你
I will hurt you. Again.

258
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:49,830
什么 他们对你做了什么
What? What have they done to you?

259
00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:53,330
他们向我展示了我的真实身份
They showed me what I am.

260
00:28:55,910 --> 00:28:57,910
身份只有你自己才能决定
Only you can show what you are.

261
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:02,000
你的行为决定了你的善恶
You choose by what you do.

262
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,620
你是来帮忙的
You're here to help.

263
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:20,830
我知道的
I know it.

264
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:42,330
把眼睛闭上 只会疼一下
Close your eyes. -It'll only hurt but a moment.

265
00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:45,290
不要
No!

266
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:14,290
你们从黑影中来
From shadow you came.

267
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:18,040
我命令你们滚回黑影中去
To shadow I bid you return!

268
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:22,620
-他不是索隆 -他是另外一个 是那个伊斯塔尔…
-He is not Sauron. -He is the other. The Istar. He is...

269
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:24,330
我是好人
I'm good.

270
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:06,870
诺瑞
Nori!

271
00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:19,450
萨道克
Sadoc?

272
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:32,160
别动 我们会想办法把你带回去
Hold still. We'll find a way to carry you back.

273
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:34,200
对不起 好姑娘
Sorry, good lady.

274
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:38,370
恐怕我就要偏离轨道了
I'm afraid I'm about to go a' wandering off-trail.

275
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:42,080
布罗斯先生…
Mr. Burrows...

276
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:44,290
没事的 普罗德菲洛
It's all right, Proudfellow.

277
00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:47,910
夫人肯定会在那边等着我
The missus will be waitin'.

278
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:54,450
如果你不介意 我现在只想坐一会儿
Now, if you don't mind, I'd just like to sit a while,

279
00:31:55,790 --> 00:31:57,200
等着看太阳升起
watch the Sun come up.

280
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:16,080
一 二 三
One, two, three,

281
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:20,200
四 五 六
-four, five, six,

282
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:22,660
七 八…
seven, eight...

283
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,250
一共是九步…
It's nine...

284
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:29,200
到主杆一共九级台阶
Stairs to main-post.

285
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,250
您做得很好
You're doing well.

286
00:33:39,330 --> 00:33:42,750
船长 你敢再这样怜悯我 我就降你的职
Patronize me like that again, Captain, I'll have your ship.

287
00:33:44,870 --> 00:33:46,290
那过来吧
Come then.

288
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:49,370
我护着你
I have you.

289
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:57,290
那谁来护着你呢
And who has you?

290
00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:03,830
鉴于你的丧子之痛
Given your loss,

291
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:09,540
我们回去后 如果你想请辞 我非常理解
I would understand it if upon our return, you wish to take a leave of duty.

292
00:34:13,910 --> 00:34:18,870
您有一次问我 为什么要把加拉德瑞尔从海里救出来
You once asked me why I pulled Galadriel from the sea.

293
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:22,370
我自称当时别无选择
I claimed to have had little choice.

294
00:34:23,870 --> 00:34:26,540
但事实是 我本可以把她留在海里
But the truth is, I could have left her there.

295
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:29,910
本可以拒绝随她到中洲
Could've refused to follow her to Middle-earth.

296
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:33,580
或者阻止我儿子去中洲
Or stopped my son from doing so.

297
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:38,910
但在每一个转折点 我都做出了当下的选择 因为…
Yet at every turn, I made the choices I did because...

298
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:41,790
为什么 埃兰迪尔
Why, Elendil?

299
00:34:44,450 --> 00:34:48,410
因为“埃兰迪尔” 不光意味着“爱星星的人”
Because "Elendil" does not merely mean "one who loves the stars."

300
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:52,160
我只是没想到会导致现在这种结局
I just never imagined it would lead here.

301
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:09,080
我父亲曾经告诉我 忠贞派的处事方式就是要
My father once told me that the way of The Faithful

302
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:11,160
衷心实意付出代价…
is committing to pay the price...

303
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:15,330
即便还不知道代价会是什么
Even if the cost cannot be known.

304
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:20,580
还要相信 付出的代价终将会是值得的
And trusting that, in the end, it will be worth it.

305
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:28,790
有时候代价会很高昂
Sometimes the cost is dear.

306
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,250
的确如此
It is.

307
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:39,500
但我们别无选择 只能继续履职尽责
We have little choice then but to keep serving.

308
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:47,000
而且我敢说 我会让结局对得起这份代价
And I, for one, will see to it that we make the end worth the price.

309
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:50,200
不管发生什么
Come what may?

310
00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:52,830
不管发生什么
Come what may.

311
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:06,660
船长 能看见努门诺尔了
Captain. Númenor is in sight.

312
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:14,200
女王陛下
My Queen.

313
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:45,330
埃兰迪尔 怎么了 出什么事了
Elendil, what is it? What's wrong?

314
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:52,200
怎么了
What is it?

315
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:54,950
你看到什么了
What do you see?

316
00:37:46,290 --> 00:37:47,540
出什么事了
-What has happened?

317
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:51,830
秘银太孤傲
The mithril is proud.

318
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:57,750
它拒绝与次等矿石结合
It refuses every effort to bond it with lesser ores.

319
00:37:57,830 --> 00:38:00,500
汲取物质世界和不可见世界的力量
Tapping into the powers of the Seen and Unseen World

320
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:03,330
似乎弱化了两者之间的界限
seemed to soften the boundaries between the two.

321
00:38:03,410 --> 00:38:04,580
这根本讲不通啊
Doesn't make any sense.

322
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:07,370
我们施加的压力 大到能让天地都融为一体
We used enough pressure to fuse the heavens with earth.

323
00:38:07,450 --> 00:38:10,700
-这次本来应该行啊  -要有耐心 这是一个过程
-It should have held this time! -Patience. This is a journey.

324
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:13,660
并非每次努力 都是朝着进步的方向 这需要时间
Not every step we take will be forward. It may take time.

325
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:15,620
-时间 我们没有时间 -时间…
-Time? We don't... We don't have time. -Time...

326
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:18,000
要不今天就到这里吧
Perhaps that is enough for today.

327
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:21,040
或许我们把自己逼得太紧了
Perhaps we've been pushing ourselves too hard.

328
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:23,290
“我们把自己逼得太紧了”
"Pushing ourselves too hard."

329
00:38:28,290 --> 00:38:30,040
假如说这就是问题所在
Supposing that's the trouble.

330
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:34,290
假如说是我们用力过猛呢
Supposing we've been using too much force?

331
00:38:34,370 --> 00:38:36,410
什么意思
Meaning what?

332
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:39,660
意思是不应该强迫金属的结合…
Meaning that the metals shouldn't be forced to join...

333
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:43,660
而是应该将彼此吸引 诱导到一起
But more drawn or coaxed together.

334
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:47,660
如果真是这样 那我们一直在朝反方向努力
Now, if that's true, we've been... we've been doing it all inside out.

335
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:53,160
快点把它拆开 我们重新开始
Quickly. Dismantle this. We start again.

336
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,200
夫人
My lady.

337
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:28,830
加拉德瑞尔
Galadriel!

338
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:32,040
我们找到方法了
We found it.

339
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:34,910
不知道以前怎么没发现
I don't know how we missed it before.

340
00:39:35,410 --> 00:39:37,500
它的力量过于强大 单个物体无法承受
It's too much power for one object.

341
00:39:38,290 --> 00:39:39,620
我们需要两个
We need two.

342
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:41,870
我们要做两个
We're making two.

343
00:39:41,950 --> 00:39:44,250
-两个王冠  -不完全是
-Two crowns? -Not exactly.

344
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:46,620
得做成稍微…
It'll need to be something...

345
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:48,870
小一点的东西
Smaller.

346
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:51,200
来 你自己看
Come, see for yourself.

347
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:53,830
你先告诉我你是谁
Not until you tell me who you are.

348
00:39:55,870 --> 00:39:57,450
你知道我是谁
You know who I am.

349
00:39:57,540 --> 00:39:59,450
我是说你真正的身份
Who you really are.

350
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:03,540
加拉德瑞尔 恐怕我听不…
Galadriel, I'm afraid I don't...

351
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:07,290
根本没有南方大地的国王
There is no King of the Southlands.

352
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,580
这条血脉早就断掉了
The line was broken.

353
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:14,160
你身上的徽章 它最后的主人 早在一千多年前就去世了
The last man to bear your crest died over a thousand years ago.

354
00:40:15,290 --> 00:40:16,870
而且他没有继承人
He had no heir.

355
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,580
我告诉过你 我是在死人身上找到的
I told you I found it on a dead man.

356
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:35,910
不是的
No.

357
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:38,580
不是的 在木筏上 你救了我…
No, on the raft, you saved me...

358
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:40,410
在木筏上 是你救了我
On the raft, you saved me.

359
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:43,330
你说服了弥瑞尔出兵拯救中洲的人类
You convinced Míriel to save the Men of Middle-earth.

360
00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:46,450
是你说服了她 我当时可是想留在努门诺尔的
You convinced her. I wanted to remain in Númenor.

361
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:48,660
你与我并肩作战
You fought beside me.

362
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:51,910
抗击你的敌人 以及我的敌人
Against your enemy. And mine.

363
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:58,120
告诉我你的名字
Tell me your name.

364
00:41:00,870 --> 00:41:04,700
自打创始之初 我就已经醒来
I have been awake since before the breaking of the first silence.

365
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:09,080
那个时候…我有很多个名字
In that time... I have had many names.

366
00:41:34,330 --> 00:41:36,330
又没站稳当吧 妹妹
Lose your footing again, sister?

367
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:42,950
就是摔了一下而已
It was just a little tumble, is all.

368
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,080
站起来吧
On your feet now.

369
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:01,580
滚出我的大脑
Get out of my mind.

370
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:03,830
拜托了 妹妹
Please, sister.

371
00:42:06,410 --> 00:42:07,790
看着我
Look at me.

372
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:10,620
加拉德瑞尔
Galadriel.

373
00:42:22,410 --> 00:42:24,040
我的旧短剑
My old dagger.

374
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:27,790
这段时间你一直好好保管着它
You've kept it safe all this time.

375
00:42:30,830 --> 00:42:32,830
你一直很勇敢
You have been very brave.

376
00:42:35,410 --> 00:42:39,410
你苦苦战斗了这么多年
You have fought so hard. For so many years.

377
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:42,950
去完成我的未竟之事
To complete the task that I could not.

378
00:42:45,370 --> 00:42:47,540
你的任务是猎杀索隆
Your task was hunting Sauron.

379
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:52,620
我的任务是确保和平
My task was to ensure peace.

380
00:42:54,910 --> 00:42:59,330
但我了解到 索隆的任务也是确保和平
But I learned that was Sauron's task as well.

381
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,370
不是的
No.

382
00:43:03,870 --> 00:43:05,290
不 你死了
No, you died.

383
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:08,750
就因为索隆 你和无数精灵一起牺牲了
Along with countless others, because of him.

384
00:43:08,830 --> 00:43:10,950
不是的 加拉德瑞尔
No, Galadriel.

385
00:43:12,750 --> 00:43:17,580
他寻求力量并不是为了摧毁中洲
He was seeking a power not to destroy Middle-earth,

386
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,160
而是将其治愈
but to heal it.

387
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:27,620
就像你的精灵同胞们 正在力求做到的那样
Just as your fellow Elves are seeking to do this very moment.

388
00:43:29,410 --> 00:43:30,910
你不必对他们撒谎
You needn't lie to them.

389
00:43:33,370 --> 00:43:35,370
只消让工作继续进行
Simply let the work proceed.

390
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:45,290
还记得就在这棵树下 我对你耳语的那番话吗
Do you remember what I whispered to you under this very tree?

391
00:43:51,870 --> 00:43:53,870
再触碰一次黑暗
Touch the darkness once more.

392
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:12,500
我哥哥死了 全都是因为你
My brother is dead. Because of you.

393
00:44:12,580 --> 00:44:16,410
加拉德瑞尔 你为什么要说这种话
Galadriel. Why would you say that?

394
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:19,200
为什么要说这样的话
Why would you say such a thing?

395
00:44:20,250 --> 00:44:21,500
加拉德瑞尔
Galadriel.

396
00:44:23,290 --> 00:44:25,750
加拉德瑞尔 回到我身边
Galadriel. Come back to me.

397
00:44:25,830 --> 00:44:28,870
加拉德瑞尔 看着我
Galadriel. Look at me!

398
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:35,000
加拉德瑞尔 看着我
Galadriel. Look at me.

399
00:44:39,870 --> 00:44:41,290
你知道我是谁
You know who I am.

400
00:44:43,620 --> 00:44:44,700
我是你朋友
I am your friend.

401
00:44:44,790 --> 00:44:47,200
你是魔苟斯的朋友
You are a friend of Morgoth's.

402
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:54,330
当年魔苟斯被打败
When Morgoth was defeated,

403
00:44:56,620 --> 00:45:01,370
就好像一个攥紧的大拳头
it was as if a great, clenched fist

404
00:45:02,790 --> 00:45:05,040
从我的脖子上松开了
had released its grasp from my neck.

405
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:08,830
在第一个日出的寂静之中
And in the stillness of that first sunrise,

406
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:14,160
我终于又感受到了独一之神的光芒
at last, I felt the light of The One again.

407
00:45:16,620 --> 00:45:20,830
我知道如果我想得到宽恕
And I knew if ever I was to be forgiven...

408
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:25,700
就必须治愈 我曾助纣为虐破坏掉的一切
That I had to heal everything that I had helped ruin.

409
00:45:25,790 --> 00:45:28,450
任何补赎都无法抹去你犯下的恶
No penance could ever erase the evil you have done.

410
00:45:28,540 --> 00:45:31,750
-你根本不是这样想的 -我的想法用不着你说
-That is not what you believe. -Do not tell me what I believe.

411
00:45:31,830 --> 00:45:33,410
不 是你告诉我的
No. You told me.

412
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:38,370
我们胜利之后 你说我不必再纠结以前做过的任何事
After our victory, you said that whatever I'd done before I could be free of it now.

413
00:45:38,450 --> 00:45:40,830
-是你骗我在先 -我告诉了你真相
-You deceived me. -I told you the truth.

414
00:45:40,910 --> 00:45:44,500
我告诉过你我做过恶 是你不在乎
I told you that I had done evil, and you did not care.

415
00:45:44,580 --> 00:45:47,950
因为你知道 跟我们的未来相比
Because you knew that our past meant nothing,

416
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:49,700
我们的过去毫无意义
weighed against our future.

417
00:45:50,620 --> 00:45:52,620
根本没有这样的未来
There is no such future.

418
00:45:53,910 --> 00:45:55,080
没有吗
Isn't there?

419
00:46:17,290 --> 00:46:19,290
其他人都用怀疑的眼光看待你
All others look on you with doubt.

420
00:46:21,870 --> 00:46:23,870
唯有我能看到你的伟大
I alone can see your greatness.

421
00:46:28,450 --> 00:46:32,040
只有我能看到你的光芒
I alone can see your light.

422
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:35,910
你会让我变成暴君
You would make me a tyrant.

423
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,620
我会让你成为女王
I would make you a queen.

424
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:41,040
像大海和太阳一样美
Fair as the sea and the Sun.

425
00:46:41,870 --> 00:46:44,450
比大地的根基还要坚固
Stronger than the foundations of the earth.

426
00:46:45,250 --> 00:46:47,830
还有你 国王大人
And you. My king.

427
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:50,790
黑暗魔君
The Dark Lord.

428
00:46:50,870 --> 00:46:53,870
不 没有黑暗
No. Not dark.

429
00:46:54,950 --> 00:46:56,660
只要你在我身边 就不会是黑暗
Not with you at my side.

430
00:46:57,950 --> 00:47:01,950
你曾经告诉我 命运有意把我们安排在一起
You told me once, that we were brought together for a purpose.

431
00:47:04,290 --> 00:47:05,620
就是这样
This is it.

432
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:10,370
你赠我以光芒 我赐你以力量
You bind me to the light. And I bind you to power.

433
00:47:12,620 --> 00:47:16,200
我们可以一起拯救中洲
Together, we can save this Middle-earth.

434
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:19,290
拯救
Save?

435
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:22,540
还是统治
Or rule?

436
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:26,330
我觉得这二者没什么区别
I see no difference.

437
00:47:29,450 --> 00:47:34,790
这就是为什么… 我永远不会站在你那边
And that is why... I will never be at your side.

438
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:40,750
你别无选择
You have no choice.

439
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:43,290
没有我 你们精灵将会衰落
Without me, your people will fade.

440
00:47:43,370 --> 00:47:46,580
黑影将会蔓延 加重 直至笼罩整个世界
And the shadow will spread and darken to cover all the world.

441
00:47:46,660 --> 00:47:49,250
-你需要我 -我当初就应该把你丢在海上
-You need me. -I should have left you on the sea.

442
00:47:49,330 --> 00:47:51,790
你当时在海里 就是因为精灵们把你赶了出去
A sea you were on because the Elves cast you out.

443
00:47:51,870 --> 00:47:56,290
他们把你赶走 就因为你乞求他们给你几个士兵
They cast you out for deigning to beg them for a few petty soldiers.

444
00:47:56,370 --> 00:47:59,870
等你告诉他们 你是我的盟友时 他们会怎么做
What will they do when you tell them that you were my ally?

445
00:47:59,950 --> 00:48:04,540
等你告诉他们是你救活了索隆
When you tell them that Sauron lives because of you?

446
00:48:04,620 --> 00:48:06,370
我要杀了你
And you will die because of me.

447
00:48:42,660 --> 00:48:44,250
加拉德瑞尔
Galadriel!

448
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:52,000
骗子
Deceiver!

449
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:55,370
加拉德瑞尔 住手  埃尔隆德 是埃尔隆德
-Galadriel, stop! Elrond. It's Elrond.

450
00:48:55,450 --> 00:48:56,500
证明给我看
Prove it.

451
00:48:58,750 --> 00:49:00,160
我们第一次见面是在哪里
Where did we first meet?

452
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:03,790
在海滨 当时我刚成为孤儿
Seaside. When I was first orphaned.

453
00:49:04,790 --> 00:49:08,540
我独自一人 是个年幼的 半精灵男孩 举目无亲 也没有朋友
I was alone. A young, half-elven boy, without friend or kin.

454
00:49:11,620 --> 00:49:13,120
你给了我水
You gave me water.

455
00:49:17,660 --> 00:49:18,910
埃尔隆德
Elrond.

456
00:49:22,750 --> 00:49:25,160
活下去 加拉德瑞尔
á cuith tess?, Galadriel.

457
00:49:26,290 --> 00:49:29,200
凯勒布林博在哪
Celebrimbor. Where is he?

458
00:49:29,290 --> 00:49:32,660
在工作间 他马上就要完工了
Workshop. He'll almost be finished by now.

459
00:49:32,750 --> 00:49:34,000
不
No!

460
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:37,250
加拉德瑞尔 出什么事了
Galadriel! Galadriel! What has happened?

461
00:49:42,540 --> 00:49:43,620
加拉德瑞尔
Galadriel!

462
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:50,700
做好了吗
-Is it done?

463
00:49:50,790 --> 00:49:53,410
加拉德瑞尔 你浑身湿透了
Galadriel. You're as wet as a river rock.

464
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:54,580
怎么回事
Why?

465
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:57,580
因为我刚把她 从格蓝都因河中拖了出来
Because I pulled her from the waters of Glanduin.

466
00:49:57,660 --> 00:49:59,620
格蓝都因河 怎么回事
The Glanduin? What happened?

467
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:00,950
加拉德瑞尔
Galadriel?

468
00:50:04,250 --> 00:50:05,750
哈尔布兰德去哪了
Where is Halbrand?

469
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:11,620
他走了 我怀疑他不会回来了
He is gone. And I doubt he will return.

470
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:16,080
如果他再回来 谁都不准再与他联络
And should he ever, none of us are to treat with him again.

471
00:50:17,330 --> 00:50:19,410
那条溪流旁发生了什么
What happened by that stream?

472
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:21,500
你之前跟我说你犯过一个错误
You spoke to me once of a mistake.

473
00:50:22,790 --> 00:50:24,750
你说你不会再犯
One you said you would not make again.

474
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:28,750
但你让我这个承诺很难兑现
You're making that promise very difficult to keep.

475
00:50:28,830 --> 00:50:31,910
要是容易办到的话 也就不需要信任了
Were it easy, it would not require trust.

476
00:50:39,370 --> 00:50:41,290
那我们继续吗
So, do we proceed?

477
00:50:41,370 --> 00:50:42,250
不
No.

478
00:50:44,950 --> 00:50:46,950
我们必须做三个
We must make three.

479
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:48,870
三个 为什么要三个
Three? Why three?

480
00:50:50,790 --> 00:50:54,620
单个容易堕落 成双总会分裂
One will always corrupt. Two will divide.

481
00:50:54,750 --> 00:50:57,580
而三个 就有了平衡
But with three, there is balance.

482
00:51:03,370 --> 00:51:08,370
我们今天锻造的力量必须只属于精灵
The powers we forge today must be for the Elves alone.

483
00:51:09,410 --> 00:51:11,410
不得被他人触及
Untouched by other hands.

484
00:51:12,660 --> 00:51:16,540
加拉德瑞尔 我已经确定
Galadriel, I have determined that the purity

485
00:51:16,620 --> 00:51:19,700
合金中次要矿石的纯度至关重要
of the lesser ores in the alloy is crucial.

486
00:51:22,250 --> 00:51:25,660
我需要最精纯的金银
I need gold and silver of the most exquisite quality.

487
00:51:27,790 --> 00:51:29,950
我需要维林诺的金银
I need gold and silver from Valinor.

488
00:51:34,450 --> 00:51:38,870
真正的创造需要…牺牲
True creation requires... sacrifice.

489
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:49,160
你还记得其他什么吗
Do you remember anything more yet?

490
00:51:50,290 --> 00:51:53,700
都是一些碎片的印象了
Fragments. Impressions.

491
00:51:55,330 --> 00:52:00,000
能想起来的越来越多 但为了找到 余下的记忆 我必须前往鲁恩
More has come. But to discover the rest, I know I must go to Rh?n.

492
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:04,790
他们把你的名字都搞错了
They were wrong about your name.

493
00:52:04,870 --> 00:52:08,370
如果他们把地名 也弄错了呢 或者撒谎了 或者…
What if they're wrong about that, too? Or lying, or...

494
00:52:08,450 --> 00:52:13,950
我知道他们说的是真的 但我无法解释
What they said, I knew to be true with a... a certainty that I can't explain.

495
00:52:17,290 --> 00:52:18,500
他们…
They, um...

496
00:52:19,330 --> 00:52:22,080
他们称呼你为“伊斯塔尔”
They called you something else. "Istar."

497
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:24,500
这是你的种族吗
Is that your kind?

498
00:52:26,540 --> 00:52:27,790
“伊斯塔尔”
"Istar?"

499
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:33,330
在你们的语言中 意思是“智者”
In your tongue, that means "wise one."

500
00:52:34,410 --> 00:52:35,250
或者…
Or...

501
00:52:38,450 --> 00:52:39,790
“巫师”
"Wizard."

502
00:52:51,410 --> 00:52:53,830
你真的不和我们一起走吗
You're really not coming with us, are ya?

503
00:52:59,620 --> 00:53:04,080
有时 我们的前路 早已被更强大的力量所安排
Betimes, our paths are laid before us by powers greater than our own.

504
00:53:04,750 --> 00:53:07,620
这时 我们的任务就是要百折不挠
In those moments, it's our task to make our feet go

505
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:10,950
坚决踏上心里所忌惮的那条道路
where our hearts wish not to tread.

506
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:14,000
不论沿途有什么危险在等待
No matter the perils awaiting us on the way.

507
00:53:16,870 --> 00:53:19,500
听起来有点像冒险
-Sounds a bit like an adventure. -Oh.

508
00:53:19,580 --> 00:53:21,250
对一个人而言 只是旅程
Alone, it's just a journey.

509
00:53:22,580 --> 00:53:26,000
对一群人而言 才是冒险
Now adventures, they must be shared.

510
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:36,910
我觉得我冒过的险 比任何毛脚族能想到的还要多
Think I've had about as much adventure as any Harfoot could ever hope for.

511
00:53:49,750 --> 00:53:53,080
这里写道 如果往北走
Says here, if we go north-ways,

512
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:56,660
一路上我们会有三十天都很安全
we have thirty days of clear trail.

513
00:53:56,790 --> 00:53:58,870
到处都是新鲜草地 没有食人妖
All fresh grass and no trolls.

514
00:53:59,950 --> 00:54:04,410
-嘿 看起来好像都是下坡… -你拿倒了
-Hey, hey, hey! -All downhill, look like... -You're holding it upside down.

515
00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:11,500
抱歉 玛尔娃 我们要连续数周爬坡过坎披荆斩棘
Sorry, Malva. Nothing but steep slopes and brickle-brambles for weeks.

516
00:54:11,580 --> 00:54:15,000
既然你这么聪明 怎么不去探路呢
Well, if you're so quick and wise, why don't you do the trail-finding?

517
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:22,160
多加留意小孩和掉队者
Watch out for little ones and stragglers.

518
00:54:22,250 --> 00:54:24,830
没有人偏离路线
Nobody goes off-trail!

519
00:54:24,910 --> 00:54:27,750
也没有人独自前行
And nobody walks alone!

520
00:54:27,830 --> 00:54:30,250
还是从萨道克的嘴里 说出来更好听一些
Sounded better when Sadoc said it.

521
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:36,620
真希望那个糟老头子还和我们在一起
Wish the old goat were still with us.

522
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:37,910
他与我们同在
He is.

523
00:54:50,410 --> 00:54:51,250
去吧
Go on.

524
00:54:55,620 --> 00:54:58,080
你现在有更重要的事情要做
You're a part of something bigger now.

525
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:01,370
他需要你
He needs ya.

526
00:55:02,580 --> 00:55:04,750
而且你属于外面的世界
And you belong out there.

527
00:55:19,410 --> 00:55:20,750
再见 诺瑞
Good-bye, Nori!

528
00:55:20,870 --> 00:55:22,290
-再见… -要小心
-Good-bye... -Be careful!

529
00:55:26,620 --> 00:55:27,450
保重
Be well.

530
00:55:37,950 --> 00:55:40,200
-你带灯了吗  -当然了
-Did you pack your lantern? -Of course.

531
00:55:40,290 --> 00:55:41,370
那就好
Good.

532
00:55:42,410 --> 00:55:46,000
那好吧…再见
Well... Goodbye.

533
00:55:49,870 --> 00:55:50,700
诺瑞…
Nori...

534
00:55:53,450 --> 00:55:55,790
好了 这是给那个大家伙吃的蜗牛
Right. Here's snails for the big fella.

535
00:55:55,870 --> 00:55:57,750
你也知道他胃口有多大
-You know how hungry he gets.

536
00:55:57,830 --> 00:56:01,330
再多带一条毯子 以防感冒
And an extra blanket in case you get cold. Right.

537
00:56:02,750 --> 00:56:03,910
让我们看看你
Let's see ya.

538
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:12,330
我真不是个好爹
Some father.

539
00:56:13,870 --> 00:56:18,200
你就要踏入外面的世界了 而我却什么都没有教过你
Here you're heading into the big beyond and I haven't taught you a bloomin' thing.

540
00:56:18,290 --> 00:56:20,450
嘿 您当然教过我了
Oh. Hey. Sure you have.

541
00:56:23,250 --> 00:56:26,370
重要的事情一定要上好双保险
Always quench your fire with water and earth.

542
00:56:26,450 --> 00:56:30,540
别在河流旁上厕所 免得到下游的时候想喝水
Don't squat by a river. Never know when you'll need a drink downstream.

543
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:35,830
有礼貌的毛脚族才有可能更快地成功
And a Harfoot without manners is as like to get far in life as a square wheel.

544
00:56:35,910 --> 00:56:37,080
否则寸步难行…
Square wheel...

545
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:42,540
父亲 您说的这些我都认真听了
I was listening to all of it, Father.

546
00:56:59,250 --> 00:57:03,750
去探索河水能流多远 去了解麻雀是在哪里学的春天之歌
Find where the river runs. Where the sparrows learn their songs.

547
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:08,870
妈妈 我会的
I will, Mother.

548
00:57:09,620 --> 00:57:10,830
而且我会多加小心
And I'll be careful.

549
00:57:15,620 --> 00:57:16,790
不
No.

550
00:57:22,250 --> 00:57:24,250
你会勇敢而无畏
You'll be bold.

551
00:57:48,410 --> 00:57:51,700
去吧…
Oh, go on. Go on.

552
00:57:51,790 --> 00:57:53,250
趁你还有这份勇气
Go on. Before you lose your nerve.

553
00:57:55,250 --> 00:57:56,870
或者说趁我们还有勇气
Or we lose ours.

554
00:58:08,250 --> 00:58:11,330
等等 诺瑞
Wait! Nori!

555
00:58:11,410 --> 00:58:12,580
波比
Poppy!

556
00:58:24,450 --> 00:58:28,120
为什么我最爱的人总是要离开
Why does everyone I love the most always have to go away?

557
00:58:29,910 --> 00:58:33,950
因为不这样做 我们就永远学不到新东西
'Cause I think if we didn't, then we'd never learn anything new.

558
00:58:40,250 --> 00:58:42,830
你会回来吗 你保证吗
You'll come back? Promise?

559
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:47,500
-你保证会照顾好大家吗  -当然了 蠢货
-You promise to look after everyone? -Course I will, ankle-head.

560
00:58:50,290 --> 00:58:54,160
你是我在这广阔 而狂野的世界里最好的朋友
You're my best friend in this whole wide, wild world.

561
00:58:54,950 --> 00:58:56,370
我愿意为你做任何事
I'd do anything for ya.

562
00:58:58,370 --> 00:59:02,620
这世界没那么大 波比 只不过是我们非常小而已
The world's not that wide, Poppy. It's just that we're so bleedin' small.

563
00:59:08,450 --> 00:59:10,450
跟紧那个高个子
Stick close to that tall fella.

564
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
他是个患难与共的好朋友
He's a good friend in a spot.

565
00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:14,500
但远不及你
Not so good as you.

566
00:59:45,950 --> 00:59:48,200
-你确定吗  -无比确定
-Are you certain? -More than ever.

567
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
好吧 他们都在向你挥手
Well, they're all waving at you.

568
00:59:52,790 --> 00:59:56,040
如果我转身 我就永远都走不了了
If I turn around, I won't ever be able to leave.

569
00:59:57,410 --> 01:00:01,410
好吧 那你在前边带头可能会好一些
Well, then perhaps it would be best if you lead off.

570
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:09,200
但真到该走的时候 却感觉脚如注铅
Uh, now that it comes to it, my feet feel heavy as iron.

571
01:00:11,540 --> 01:00:14,830
更不用说 我根本不知道前路在何方
Not to mention, I haven't an inkling which way to go.

572
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:28,410
在那里
There it is.

573
01:00:29,910 --> 01:00:31,540
你确定吗
Are you sure?

574
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:33,620
不是很确定
Not entirely.

575
01:00:34,540 --> 01:00:37,040
这边飘来的空气有一股香甜味
There's a sweet smell on the air this way.

576
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:43,200
当你怀疑的时候 埃拉诺白兰地足…
When in doubt, Elanor Brandyfoot...

577
01:00:45,620 --> 01:00:47,330
永远跟着嗅觉走
always follow your nose.

578
01:07:23,120 --> 01:07:27,500
穹苍下
Three rings for the Elven-kings

579

583

585
01:07:52,870 --> 01:07:57,080
黑暗魔君执其尊
On his dark throne

586
01:07:57,160 --> 01:08:03,040
魔多翳影
In the Land of Mordor

587
01:08:03,910 --> 01:08:09,910
邪暗深处
Where the Shadows lie

588
01:08:12,620 --> 01:08:18,620
邪暗深处
Where the Shadows lie

589
01:08:27,330 --> 01:08:32,000
统御余众 魔戒至尊

And in the darkness Bind them

593
01:08:52,250 --> 01:08:58,250
魔多大地
In the Land of Mordor

594
01:09:01,410 --> 01:09:07,410
黑影幢幢
Where the Shadows lie...

595
01:09:10,160 --> 01:09:16,160
黑影幢幢
Where the Shadows lie...
