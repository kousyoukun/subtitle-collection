1
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,830
-一座塔  -我需要在春天之前完工
-A tower? -I need it completed by spring.

2
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:13,500
您有没有考虑过 在外族中寻求合作伙伴
Have you considered seeking partners outside the confines of our own race?

3
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:15,080
跟我说说你国王的提议
Tell me about your King's proposal

4
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:17,500
我来决定要不要呈报给我父亲
so I can present it to my father.

5
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:19,700
如果他有所隐瞒 我是能感受到的
I'd sense it if he were hiding something.

6
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:23,080
或许他感受到了有所隐瞒的人是你
Perhaps he sensed that it was you who was hiding something.

7
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:24,910
这是什么地方
What is this place?

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,580
努门诺尔岛国
The Island Kingdom of Númenor.

9
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:31,120
我在考虑推迟参加海洋试炼
I was thinking I might defer.

10
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,790
等海洋试炼开始 那艘船启航时 你必须在船上
When the Sea Trial begins and that ship launches, you will be on it.

11
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,540
我不想惹麻烦
I don't want any trouble.

12
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:44,040
这是南方大地的地图
It is a map of the Southlands.

13
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:46,370
它不仅提及了一个地点 还讲述了一项计划
It speaks not only of a place, but a plan.

14
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:48,120
他们将建立自己的领地
To create a realm of their own.

15
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,160
南方大地正处于严重危险之中
Then the Southlands are in grave danger.

16
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:54,250
如果索隆真的已经卷土重来 那么南方大地只会是个开始
If Sauron has indeed returned, the Southlands are but the beginning.

17
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,870
如果你们这里有谁想活命
If there are any of you here who want to live...

18
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,290
我们明天日出时刻就一起前往精灵塔
...we make for the Elven tower at first light.

19
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,830
把他带给阿达尔
Bring him to Adar.

20
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:10,540
据说古时候 索隆有很多个名字
Adar! Sauron was said to have many names in days of old.

21
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:12,330
也许这就是其中一个
Perhaps this is one of them.

22
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:17,290
你的同胞没有国王 因为你就是国王
Your people have no king, for you are him.

23
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:19,040
跟我一起去中洲
Come with me to Middle-earth.

24
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,540
你没有军队
You're still short an army.

25
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:23,200
这些马上就将改变
That is all about to change.

26
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:43,580
指环王：力量之戒
第一季第四集

27
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:43,580
本WEB版外挂字幕由  风吹来的那片云  双语合并

28
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,080
在这座王宫 我们每天 都会齐聚一堂 共同规划岛屿的未来
In this court, we gather daily to hammer out our island's future.

29
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:08,410
但在“祝福新生儿”仪式中
But at the Blessing of the Children,

30
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,290
我们欢聚一堂 共庆新生 他们长大后将见证这座岛屿的未来
we gather to welcome those who will live that future.

31
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:20,540
孩子就像冲破海面波涛的朝阳 拥有无限的未来
One as boundless as a sunrise over the rolling sea.

32
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,330
你给她取了什么名字
What name have you chosen for her?

33
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:30,120
艾琳内尔
Alinel.

34
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:32,580
艾琳内尔
Alinel.

35
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:37,040
愿你能够拥有努门诺尔的力量
May Númenor's strength arise in thee.

36
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:41,410
愿她的智慧指引你的脚步…
Her wisdom guide thy steps...

37
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:49,500
有时我们的岛屿也需要“活动”一下
Sometimes our island just needs a stretch.

38
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:51,830
就像你一样
Just like you.

39
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:37,660
今天真是美好的一天 摄政女王
-It is a perfect day, Queen Regent.

40
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:41,950
您要先处理什么事情
What business would you begin with?

41
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:46,500
她把那个精灵传唤到了王宫
She summoned the Elf to court.

42
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,830
就是今早上的事情
Just this morning.

43
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:53,750
精灵的同伴动手打了四个公会成员 而弥瑞尔却请她喝茶
Elf's mate attacks four guildsmen, and Míriel has her up for tea?

44
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:56,000
有可能传唤精灵就是为了要惩罚她
Probably she called the Elf in to punish her.

45
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,700
也有可能是向她讨教
-Or to ask her for orders.

46
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:03,410
精灵在我们的女王耳边扇阴风点鬼火
And while the Elf whispers poison in our Queen's ear,

47
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,290
谁来替我们说话
-who's speaking for us?

48
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,250
国师
Chancellor! Chancellor!

49
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:17,370
替我向她问好 好吗 你小声点
Send her my regards, will you? Keep your voice down.

50
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:19,830
您要来一份吗 先生 来一份吧 先生
Would you like one, sir? Come on, sir.

51
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:22,620
我不知道您在忙很重要的事
I didn't realize you were in the middle of something important.

52
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:23,580
国师
Chancellor!

53
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:27,500
治国之道就是要事无巨细
Statecraft is the art of attending to small matters

54
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:29,540
事必躬亲
as diligently as grand ones.

55
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,450
我以为你现在已经学到这一点了
I should like to think you'd learned that by now.

56
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,290
我一直在想办法学着变聪明点儿
I was only trying to be clever.

57
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:38,120
野心不大的人才会只顾一味地变聪明
Cleverness is for men of small ambition.

58
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:41,910
我更希望你能有智慧 儿子
I'd much rather it if you were wise, my son.

59
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:46,080
说吧 出什么问题了
Now, what seems to be the trouble, hmm?

60
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:49,410
有人在我们眼皮底下挑事
We may have a bit of a squall on our hands.

61
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,580
精灵的船悍然停在我们的海岸
Elf ships on our shore?

62
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:55,370
精灵工匠抢走你们的商业贸易
Elf workers taking your trades?

63
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:58,950
那些工匠不需要睡觉
Workers who don't sleep,

64
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:03,120
不会疲倦 也不会变老
don't tire, don't age.

65
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:04,830
不行
No!

66
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:10,160
要我说 女王要么是瞎
I say, the Queen's either blind

67
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,080
要么就是精灵的舔狗
or an Elf lover.

68
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,370
就跟她父亲一样
-Just like her father.

69
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:16,830
-精灵的舔狗  -精灵的舔狗
-Elf lover! -Elf lover!

70
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:18,700
-精灵的舔狗  -精灵的舔狗
Elf lover!

71
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:20,580
精灵的舔狗
Elf lover! Elf lover!

72
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:24,040
如果那个精灵现在就站在这里 她看到的会是什么
And if the Elf were here now, what would she see?

73
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,330
是努门诺尔的铁血男儿
Men of Númenor,

74
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,870
还是一群只会哭闹的孩子
or a gaggle of mewling children?

75
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:34,200
我们可是伊甸人的儿女
We are sons and daughters of the Edain.

76
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:39,660
是国王埃尔洛斯塔尔明雅图尔的后代 他曾亲自率军打败魔苟斯
Of Elros Tar-Minyatur, whose host conquered Morgoth himself.

77
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:44,200
而现在区区一个 坐船逃难的精灵就能威胁到我们吗
But now one Elf, a castaway, could threaten us?

78
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:48,330
你们所有人 低头看看自己佩戴的公会徽章
Look down, each of you, at the guild crests you bear.

79
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:50,700
那可是传承自力量强大之手
The heritage of mighty hands.

80
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,450
正是伟大的祖先用双手竖起了海堤
Of men who laid the Sea Wall.

81
00:06:56,040 --> 00:07:00,870
建造了象征我们文明胜利的 阿美尼洛斯
Who raised Armenelos, triumph of our civilization.

82
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:05,000
但是现在 区区一个精灵就能威胁我们
But now, one Elf could threaten us?

83
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:18,910
朋友们…
My friends...

84
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,250
相信我
Trust in me.

85
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:26,450
看看我手上的老茧
For by the calluses on my hands,

86
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:30,830
我发誓精灵之手 永远无法夺走努门诺尔王国的船舵
I swear that Elven hands will never take Númenor's helm.

87
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:37,080
努门诺尔王国将一如既往地属于人类
She will remain, as always, a kingdom of Men.

88
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:45,620
我请大家喝一杯
Drinks all around!

89
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:18,200
他熟知这座城市里每个人的名字
Isn't a name in this city he doesn't know,

90
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:21,000
总能说服人群改变想法 几乎所有人都欠他人情
a crowd he can't turn, a favor he isn't owed...

91
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:23,700
太了不起了
It's impressive.

92
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:26,540
我本来想说“太让人不爽了”
I was going to say "infuriating."

93
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:31,700
这酒产自美尼尔塔玛的葡萄园
From vineyards near the Meneltarma.

94
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:34,660
应该能让你忘记烦恼 反正人们是这么说的
Supposed to make you forget your troubles. Or so they say.

95
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:37,660
这些甜蜜的烦恼都是我自己争取来的
My troubles have been too hard-won.

96
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:42,450
你就是那个新来的学徒
You must be the new apprentice.

97
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,410
我叫凯门 你叫…
I'm Kemen. And your name is...

98
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:48,080
埃雅瑞恩 赶紧交平面图
Hey, E?rien. Plans, now.

99
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,750
你惹恼我了 精灵
You vex me, Elf.

100
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:05,290
我对你以礼相待
I welcome you as a guest,

101
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:09,120
你却跑到我们乡下去偷古老的卷轴
and you gallop off to our countryside to steal ancient scrolls

102
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,580
与此同时 你那位来自中洲南方的 同伴还打了我们的公民
whilst your Southlander companion assaults our citizenry.

103
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:16,080
他的暴脾气可以理解 毕竟他的人民正在死去
He is understandably quick to temper. His people are dying.

104
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,700
“他的人民”
"His people"?

105
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:21,370
我相信你关在地牢里的那一位 并不是普通的闹事者
I believe the man you hold in your dungeons is no common brawler,

106
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:25,450
而是流亡在外 下落不明的南方大地王位继承人
but the lost heir in exile to the throne of the Southlands.

107
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:28,870
那看来埃兰迪尔是一位东夷皇帝
And I suppose Elendil here is a Rh?nic emperor.

108
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,870
其实也就是个小领主
Just a petty lord, actually.

109
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:36,450
他的人民散落各地 群龙无首
His people are scattered. Leaderless.

110
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:41,540
但有了你的支持 他们可能会 团结在他的旗帜之下 共同战斗
But with your backing they might unite behind his banner. And fight.

111
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:43,200
你说的“支持”是什么意思
What do you mean "backing"?

112
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:48,330
索隆曾经是你们人类的敌人 也是我们精灵的敌人
Sauron was once your people's enemy, as much as mine.

113
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:52,040
我请求您完成这件未竟之事
I call on you to finish the task left undone.

114
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:55,120
重建努门诺尔和精灵之间的联盟…
To reforge the alliance between Númenor and Elves...

115
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,450
和我并肩作战 拯救南方大地的人类
And fight with me, to save the men of the Southlands

116
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:02,200
避免索隆将他们的土地据为己有
before Sauron claims their lands for his own.

117
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:10,080
在这个王宫之中 我们经常听到许多提案
In this court we hear many proposals.

118
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,410
你的提案是几周来 我听过最令人惊讶、最具野心的
I dare say yours is the most surprising and ambitious I've heard in weeks.

119
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:20,330
但是 努门诺尔已经 选择了另一条道路
Nevertheless, Númenor has chosen another path.

120
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:24,120
并非所有人都是如此
Not all Númenor.

121
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:28,290
那个来自南方大地的人 不管 他是国王还是木匠 都将面临审判
King or carpenter, the Southlander will face judgment.

122
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:29,830
本次会面结束
This audience is ended.

123
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:47,540
那我别无选择了 只能要求另一场会面
Then I have little choice, but to ask for another.

124
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:50,040
我要求与努门诺尔真正的统治者会面
One with Númenor's true ruler.

125
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,950
也就是你的父亲 国王
Your father, the King.

126
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:56,040
你不应该说起你根本不了解的事情
You should not speak of matters you do not understand,

127
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,830
加拉德瑞尔 菲纳芬之女
Galadriel, daughter of Finarfin.

128
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:59,080
你应该靠边站
And you should stand aside,

129
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:02,120
这样我才能 向真正有权答复我的人提出提案
that I might present my proposal to one who holds the authority to answer it.

130
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,580
加拉德瑞尔女士 够了…
Lady Galadriel, that is quite enough.

131
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:06,660
你凭什么说这番话 精灵
And with what authority do you speak, Elf?

132
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,250
就凭你的人民
That of your people?

133
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:12,290
还是说你就是个坐船逃难的精灵 想在风暴中抓住救命稻草
Or are you a castaway, grasping for a handhold in a tempest?

134
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:14,370
我内心就有一股强烈的风暴
There is a tempest in me.

135
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:18,250
它把我刮到这座岛上一定是有原因的
It swept me to this island for a reason.

136
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:21,660
而你无法平息这股风暴 摄政王
And it will not be quelled by you, Regent.

137
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:30,450
我猜猜看
Don't tell me.

138
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,290
是因为在酒馆斗殴进来的
Tavern brawl?

139
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,290
因为发表煽动性言论
Sedition.

140
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:46,540
你们就快要成功了
You've nearly made it!

141
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:48,660
再过几天
In a few more days,

142
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:53,000
我就能很荣幸地 称呼你们所有人为船员了
I'll have the pleasure of calling all of you shipmates.

143
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:57,540
快拉 学员们 拉
Pull now, cadets! Pull!

144
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:05,620
伊熙尔杜…
Isildur...

145
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:20,950
快拉 学员们
Pull now, cadets!

146
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:23,160
拉
Pull!

147
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:31,700
绳索
Line!

148
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:38,160
你们好好解释一下
Explain yourselves.

149
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:40,870
长官 这肯定搞错了
Sir, no, there must be some sort of mistake.

150
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:42,830
是我的错 航海官
It was my fault, Sea-master.

151
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:44,660
是我放手了
I let it slip.

152
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:48,910
那条升降索 我见过你成功收放不下一百次
I've seen you ease that halyard proper a hundred times.

153
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:51,290
刚才是故意的
That was deliberate.

154
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,790
你被踢出海上卫队了
You're off the Sea Guard!

155
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:57,000
你们仨全部淘汰
All three of you!

156
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:04,200
“西部” “真正的努门诺尔”
"The West"? "The real Númenor"?

157
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:07,250
又是你哥常挂在嘴边的那些胡话
That garbage your brother used to spew, again!

158
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,500
我还以为航海官只会开除我
I thought the sail-master would only dismiss me.

159
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,410
对不起
I'm sorry.

160
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:16,250
你对不起
You're sorry?

161
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:20,080
你对不起  你刚刚毁了我们俩的一生
You're sorry? You just set our whole lives on fire!

162
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:23,580
夜壶在哪里 我要吐了
Where's that chamber pot? I think I'm gonna be sick.

163
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:24,910
我去和我爸谈谈
I will speak to my father.

164
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,660
-给你们俩恢复原职 -用不着
Convince him to see that you're both reinstated.

165
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:29,080
托你的福给踢出来
No. Leave it to you to get kicked out of something

166
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,950
更别说这个机会 本来也不是你自己赢来的
you never earned in the first place.

167
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,370
-维蓝迪尔… -不
-Valandil... -No.

168
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:37,120
自打我能握住船桨起 我就一直想登上那艘船
Since I was big enough to hold an oar, I wanted on that boat.

169
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:41,870
我做好了一切准备 拼尽全力去争取 而你又做了什么
I did everything I was supposed to do to earn it. And what did you do?

170
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:46,540
除了念叨你死去的母亲 你还做过什么?
What have you ever done but brood and blabber about your dead mother.

171
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:49,040
住手 够了
-Stop it! Stop it! Enough!

172
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:53,870
又是伊熙尔杜标志性的转身走人
Yeah, same old Isil walking away.

173
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:56,160
伊熙尔杜 你要去哪
Isil! Where are you going?

174
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:58,160
是去是留 有什么关系吗
Going, staying, what does it matter?

175
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,830
他才是真正的问题所在 这是无可争辩的事实
The real problem is him. And that's not going anywhere.

176
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:25,040
马格罗特
Magrot!

177
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:28,790
阿达尔…
Adar...

178
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:22,290
阿达尔…
Adar...

179
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,870
无惧赴死
Nampak uglursha.

180
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:30,660
无惧赴死
Nampak uglursha.

181
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:45,660
你的出生地在哪里…
Where were you born,

182
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,370
士兵
soldier?

183
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:54,250
贝烈瑞安德
Beleriand.

184
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,040
在河口附近
By the mouth of the river?

185
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:02,830
你是谁
Who are you?

186
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,040
我曾经去过那条河
I went down that river once...

187
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:13,750
那时我还年轻
When I was young.

188
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:19,330
我记得…
I remember...

189
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:23,950
河岸上开满了鼠尾草花
The banks were covered in sage blossoms.

190
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,450
绵延好几英里
Miles of them.

191
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:34,330
为什么奥克称呼你为父亲
Why do the Orcs call you Father?

192
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,910
你听过很多谎言
You have been told many lies.

193
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,910
有的谎言编得很真
Some run so deep,

194
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:03,660
现在就连岩石和树根都会相信
even the rocks and roots now believe them.

195
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:06,200
要揭开谎言…
To untangle it all...

196
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:11,790
几乎需要创造一个新世界
would all but require the creation of a new world.

197
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:17,580
但那是只有神才能做到的事
But that is something only the gods can do.

198
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:21,500
我不是神 起码…
And I am no god. At least...

199
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:27,120
暂时还不是
Not yet.

200
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,830
你到底是什么东西
What are you?

201
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:39,870
你去找那些在旧瞭望塔避难的人
Go to the Men who have taken refuge in the old watchtower.

202
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:44,080
给他们捎个口信
Deliver to them a message.

203
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:51,750
什么口信
What message?

204
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:18,580
兵营已经满了 大家尽可能找地方扎营
The barracks are already full. Try and make camp where you can.

205
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,450
-这些人是从哪来的  -罗尔巴德
-Where's this lot from? -Iorbad.

206
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,950
那么从这儿到欧洛朱因 所有村庄的人都到齐了
That makes it every village from here to Orodruin.

207
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:34,870
剩下的呢
Where's the rest?

208
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:37,370
只剩下这些了
That is the rest.

209
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:39,500
我们还得减少口粮配额
We'll have to cut rations again.

210
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:41,120
你不能减我的配额
You're not cutting my rations.

211
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,660
-是谁给你的决定权  -当然是每个决定来这里
Who gave you the right to decide?

212
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:46,580
来这座瓦尔德雷格瞭望塔的人 其中也包括你
Everyone who decided to come to this tower, Waldreg. Including you.

213
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:47,750
那我们吃什么
What will we eat?

214
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:50,080
-我们会想出办法的 -什么办法
-We'll find a way. -How?

215
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,790
-我不知道 -你能知道才怪了
-I don't know. -Huh. Plain enough to see that.

216
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,910
去瓦尔德雷格的地窖看看怎么样
What about Waldreg's root cellar?

217
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:58,700
我们派一个小队进镇里去
We send a small party into town.

218
00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:02,910
等白天奥克数量比较少时 悄悄行动 把能拿走的东西迅速拿走
By day, when the Orcs are fewer, grab what we can, quick and quiet.

219
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,080
奥克根本不会知道我们去过
They'll never even know we were there.

220
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,080
你准备忽悠哪些倒霉蛋去干这事
What poor sod will you rope into that?

221
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:10,200
如果其他人不愿意去 我自己去
I'll do it, if nobody else will.

222
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:11,950
你不能去
You're not going down there.

223
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:16,160
我们先再次上山觅食 去召集猎人吧
We'll forage the hills again first. Gather the hunters.

224
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:19,370
他们去捕什么 几只兔子吗
And what will they hunt? A few rabbits?

225
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:20,620
那只够我们撑一天
That'll feed us a day.

226
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:23,450
撑过一天是一天 能多撑一天就应该心存感激
Then it's another day. And let us be grateful for it.

227
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:24,620
我受够了这样
I'm sick and tired

228
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:27,830
看着一切支离破碎却无动于衷
of watching everything go to tatters and not doing anything about it.

229
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:30,250
-我们已经在尽力而为了 -但我没有
-We are doing everything we can. -Well, I'm not!

230
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:31,700
希奥
Theo. Theo!

231
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:34,870
你要么帮我 要么就是给我找麻烦
You can either help me or you can make it harder.

232
00:20:55,410 --> 00:20:57,790
我刚才就不应该听你的
I should never have let you talk me into this.

233
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:01,620
我要回去
I'm heading back.

234
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:05,330
别这么怂
Don't be such a soft-belly.

235
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:07,410
走吧
Come on.

236
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,410
罗恩 那边有小酒馆
Rowan, the tavern.

237
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,950
我可不进去
I'm not going in there.

238
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:34,830
里边可能有更多的食物
-There might be more food.

239
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:36,870
拜托 那个地方已经荒废了
Come on, this place is deserted.

240
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,620
好吧 那我去
All right. I'll go.

241
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:38,750
罗恩
Rowan?

242
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:16,700
童子血
Young blood.

243
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:23,580
这你是从哪儿弄来的
Where'd you get that?

244
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,250
给我
Give it here.

245
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,000
喂 我找到了
Oi! I found it!

246
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:51,950
我找到了 是个小男孩  他手上有剑
I found it! It's a boy! He has the hilt!

247
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,700
男孩 他在哪里
A boy? Where is he?

248
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:55,500
他就躲在这附近
-He's hiding here somewhere.

249
00:23:56,330 --> 00:23:58,660
你 去向父亲大人报告
You! Send word to Lord-father.

250
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,910
其他人 散开搜
Rest of you, fan out.

251
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,580
找不到他 谁也别想睡觉
Nobody sleeps till he's found.

252
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:30,580
找到你了
Got ya!

253
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,500
精灵和矮人通力合作 真了不起
Elves and Dwarves working together. Remarkable.

254
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:58,290
都被你言中了
It is everything you said it would be.

255
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:04,540
怎么了
What?

256
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,250
没什么 只是…
Nothing. Just...

257
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:10,330
你站在那里 有那么一瞬间 像极了你父亲
For a moment, standing there, you were the very image of your father.

258
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:15,660
-我都不知道你见过我父亲 -当然了 见过很多次
I wasn't aware you'd ever met him. Of course, many times.

259
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:19,000
他拥有远眺未来的能力
He had that way of seeing far off.

260
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,330
你知道吗 我记得有一次 他对我说
Do you know, I remember once, he said to me,

261
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:29,750
“总有一天 我的未来都将掌握在我儿子手中”
one day, my future would be in his son's hands.

262
00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:36,410
他说得很随意 就好像是在说明天要下雨似的
He said it quite casually, as if one might speak of tomorrow's rain.

263
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:38,330
但我却…
And I've... I've...

264
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:42,250
我都忘了 直到…直到此时此刻
I'd forgotten that until... Till this moment.

265
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:45,660
这不是很奇怪吗
Isn't that odd?

266
00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:50,950
陛下 您今天似乎很不安
You seem unsettled today, my lord.

267
00:25:51,870 --> 00:25:53,080
什么事情在困扰您
-What troubles you?

268
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:57,870
不行 我向自己保证过绝不提起 他毕竟是你朋友
No, I promised myself I wouldn't mention it. He's your friend.

269
00:25:57,950 --> 00:25:59,080
都林
Durin.

270
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:05,000
他要么是在躲避我 要么是在隐瞒什么
Either he's avoiding me or he's... he's hiding something.

271
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:18,410
你问过他出工的团队了吗
Did you try asking his work teams?

272
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:22,370
19个矮人我都问了 他们全都在找借口推辞我
All nineteen of them. They keep putting me off.

273
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:24,660
让我感觉近乎可疑了
One would almost think it suspicious.

274
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:28,790
你是在暗示 都林给自己找了个小女朋友吗
Are you suggesting Durin's got himself a wee girlfriend?

275
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:31,910
-夫人 你是都林的唯一 -我知道
-There is none other than you, milady. -I know.

276
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,250
谁会要他啊
-Who'd have him?

277
00:26:35,370 --> 00:26:38,660
老富婆 亲石头 抛光宝石 把金打磨
Rich crone, kiss the stone Polish your gems and gold

278
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:39,910
别闹了
-Ow! Stop it!

279
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,750
格尔达 别打你弟弟了
Gerda, stop hitting your brother!

280
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:45,200
-我们在玩敲门游戏 -好吧 别闹了
We're playing the knocking game. -Well, knock it off.

281
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:49,250
你去金色阶梯找过了吗
Have you tried the Golden Stairs?

282
00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:51,080
或者三门守卫
Or the Three-door Guard?

283
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:56,580
我忘了
I'd forgotten.

284
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:59,910
这些熊孩子把我的脑子都喊糊涂了
These wee'ns are turning my mind to mush.

285
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,870
他今天去石英矿坑采矿去了
He was off to mine Quartz Chasm today.

286
00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:08,830
你知道吗 迪莎 没有什么秘密值得用欺骗来掩饰
You know, Disa, there is no secret worth concealing with deception.

287
00:27:10,370 --> 00:27:13,330
你在我家指着鼻子说矮人不诚实
Calling a Dwarf dishonest in her own home?

288
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,080
这话火药味颇浓啊
That's a recipe for strong gravy.

289
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:20,080
如果都林在采石英矿
If Durin is mining quartz,

290
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:22,910
那他为什么不带着他的凿斧
why would he leave without taking his chiseling axe?

291
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,330
而且你为什么 这么早就准备他爱吃的菜
And why would you prepare his favorite meal

292
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:28,830
他需要两天时间才能下降到那个矿坑
if he's gone to a chasm that takes two full days to descend to?

293
00:27:28,910 --> 00:27:31,450
老富婆 亲石头 抛光宝石…
Rich crone, kiss the stone Polish your gems and gold

294
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:33,290
格尔达 我警告你
Gerda, I'm warning you!

295
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,910
都林没有带斧头
Durin didn't bring his axe

296
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:45,330
是因为他开采的石英不需要凿 而是需要撬的
because the quartz he's mining isn't chiseled. It is pried.

297
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,700
我在做鼹鼠尾炖菜
I am making mole-tail stew

298
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:50,870
是因为赶在他回家之前 做好这道菜还需要花上一些时间
because it needs a wee while to set before he's home.

299
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:55,620
虽然对于像你这样的外族来说 下降到矿坑可能需要几天时间
And while it may take several days for an outsider, such as you,

300
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:57,660
但像我丈夫一样的矮人攀登者
Dwarven climbers like my husband

301
00:27:57,750 --> 00:28:01,080
可以在几个小时内就下降到石英矿坑
can make the descent to Quartz Chasm in just a few hours.

302
00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:05,290
你还有什么想问的吗 亲爱的
Was there anything else you wanted to ask about, dearie?

303
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:08,540
没有了
No.

304
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:10,870
谢谢
Thank you.

305
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:23,660
石英矿坑 编得不错
Quartz Chasm. Not bad. Not bad.

306
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:27,250
我就盼着他信了我 那个精灵可真不容易骗啊
I just hope he believed me. He's not easily taken in, that Elf.

307
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:28,750
肯定不容易骗
Certainly not.

308
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:34,040
幸运的是 我未来的女王居然能把精灵忽悠信了
Lucky my future queen could convince a water rat to wear a mink coat.

309
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:39,500
又多了一个娶了你的好处 幸亏当年没娶马吉德鲁斯特博林
One more reason to count my blessings I married you, not Margid Rustborin.

310
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:41,410
还有什么其他好处
And what are the other reasons?

311
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,540
回头告诉你
I'll tell you later.

312
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:46,540
安静 我们最好还是小声点
Hush now. We better keep our pipes down.

313
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:51,580
我们的旧矿开采进展顺利
We're making good progress in the old mine.

314
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:54,870
我确保他被护送离开…
I made sure he was escorted out...

315
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:08,080
镜影湖下面的旧矿场
The old mine below the Mirrormere.

316
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,410
精灵 你迷路了吗
You lost, Elf?

317
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,750
没有 我很清楚自己要去哪
No. I know exactly where I'm going.

318
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,250
日安
-Good day.

319
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:19,290
老富婆 亲石头 抛光宝石 把金打磨
-Rich crone, kiss the stone. Polish your gems and gold.

320
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,080
我就知道
I knew it!

321
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,160
都林
Durin?

322
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:07,040
精灵 你是来监视我的吗
-Came to spy on me, Elf? -Hardly.

323
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,120
并不是 这是什么地方
-What is this place?

324
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,120
你真指望我相信你什么都不知道吗
You really expect me to believe you do not know?

325
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:16,040
这不是他派你来的真正原因吗
That this was not the true reason he sent you here to begin with?

326
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,080
你们想要据为己有
You want it for yourselves.

327
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,750
都林 想要什么
Durin, want what?

328
00:31:22,410 --> 00:31:25,660
我根本不在乎那个洞穴里有什么东西
I care nothing for whatever is in that chamber.

329
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:29,200
我只在乎你 在乎这份友谊
I do care for you, for this friendship.

330
00:31:30,410 --> 00:31:32,120
而秘密是会阻碍友谊的
And secrets do not become it.

331
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,120
这么大场面是在干什么
What is the meaning of all this? Mm?

332
00:31:41,330 --> 00:31:43,000
你得发誓
I need your oath.

333
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:52,080
向山起誓
Hand to mountain,

334
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:55,000
你永远不会将我要告诉你的事情
you'll never breathe so much as a whisper

335
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:58,290
告诉其他生灵 哪怕是轻声细语也不行
of what I'm about to tell you to another living soul.

336
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:02,120
矮人的记仇能力比精灵的记忆力还强
Dwarven anger outlives even Elven memory.

337
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,790
如果你违背誓言
Break your promise,

338
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:08,450
这块石头的力量 必将令你和你的亲人陷入悲伤
and the power of this stone will doom you and your kin to sorrow,

339
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:11,330
直至你们活在中洲的最后一天
to your last day on this Middle-earth.

340
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,830
你敢这样发誓吗 埃尔隆德
Do you swear it, Elrond?

341
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:31,330
我以我父亲 水手埃雅仁迪尔的名义起誓
I swear on the memory of my father, E?rendil the Mariner.

342
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:39,620
你在这里告诉我的任何事情 都将止于我
Anything you tell me here will end in my ears alone.

343
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:49,410
迪莎在一次例行的金矿搜寻中 发现了这个
Disa detected it during a routine gold-seaming.

344
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:54,500
这是一种新矿石
A new ore.

345
00:32:57,290 --> 00:33:00,500
比丝轻 比铁硬
Lighter than silk, harder than iron,

346
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:03,750
用作武器 它比我们最引以为豪的兵刃还要锋利
as weaponry, it would best our proudest blades.

347
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:09,660
作为实物 它可能比黄金还珍贵
As specie, it might be dearer than gold.

348
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:13,120
它反射光线的方式很奇特
It is strange how it catches the light.

349
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:15,700
好像矿石内部就在发光
Almost seems lit from within.

350
00:33:15,790 --> 00:33:20,200
我跟你说 这可能是我们矮人新时代的开始
I tell you, this could be the beginning of a new era for our people.

351
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,660
力量、繁荣…
Strength, prosperity...

352
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:25,540
那为什么要藏着掖着
Then why all the secrecy?

353
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,540
为什么不庆祝一番呢
Why not celebrate this?

354
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:32,540
这种矿的开采非常危险
It's perilous to mine.

355
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:37,910
我父亲打着谨慎的名义
My father has restricted our every efforts

356
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,870
处处限制我们开采
in the name of caution.

357
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:43,620
我能看看吗
May I?

358
00:33:51,330 --> 00:33:53,910
你怎么称呼这种神奇的矿石
What do you call this miracle ore?

359
00:33:55,290 --> 00:33:57,290
在我们的语言里 叫“灰色的闪光”
In our tongue, "gray glitter."

360
00:33:57,370 --> 00:33:59,910
用你们的话 可能叫什么“米银”
In yours, something like mith-raud.

361
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:06,370
不不不 是秘银
No, no. It would be... mithril.

362
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:12,500
所以你远道而来 就只为了埃瑞吉安
So you really did come all this way just for Eregion?

363
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:16,120
我来这里是因为 20年不见老朋友一面 太久了
I came because 20 years is far too long to stay away.

364
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,290
连我这个精灵都觉得久
Even for an Elf.

365
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:28,950
收下吧
Keep it.

366
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:33,160
象征着我们的友谊
Token of our friendship.

367
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:38,250
很好
Very well.

368
00:34:48,450 --> 00:34:51,500
都林 不要
No! Durin! Durin! Durin, no!

369
00:34:51,950 --> 00:34:53,870
下面有四个矮人
There's four Dwarves down there!

370
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:56,750
都林
Durin!

371
00:35:14,330 --> 00:35:16,830
埃雅瑞恩 扫地 洗高脚杯
E?rien, floors and goblets.

372
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:22,790
实在对不起
I'm so sorry.

373
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:26,370
没关系 说真的 没事的
It's all right. It's all right. It's... It's... It's all right, honestly.

374
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,330
我还以为你只擅长制图呢
And here I thought your talents ended at draftsmanship.

375
00:35:29,830 --> 00:35:32,080
擦擦洗洗会让人更加灵巧
Scrubbing is good for dexterity.

376
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:34,370
会长是这么说的
Or so the guild master says.

377
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:38,700
你看这样如何  我擦地板 你洗高脚杯
So, how about this? I'll do the floors, you do the goblets.

378
00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:40,660
谁擦得慢 晚餐钱就由谁来付
And the last one to finish pays for dinner.

379
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:42,750
我不和不认识的年轻男士约会
I'm not in the habit of going off with strange young men.

380
00:35:42,830 --> 00:35:45,750
很明智 如果我看到 哪个男士举止怪异 立马告诉你
Very wise. If I see any, you'll be the first to know.

381
00:36:12,250 --> 00:36:15,910
尽管我很佩服你 每次遇到困难都会冲锋陷阵
As much as I admire your habit of charging at every obstacle in your path,

382
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,290
就像一匹全速奔跑的小马…
like a colt in full gallop...

383
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:23,830
但你有没有想过 你不是在和食人妖或奥克作斗争
Has it ever occurred to you that you're not battling trolls or Orcs,

384
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:24,870
而是和人类
but Men?

385
00:36:25,370 --> 00:36:28,040
你是真的要给我兵法方面的建议吗
Are you really about to advise me in the art of war?

386
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,620
不是 我…
No. No, I...

387
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:33,870
我可不敢 但是…
I wouldn't dare. But then...

388
00:36:34,790 --> 00:36:39,410
女王的王宫 和你平日的战场并不相同 没错吧
The queen's court isn't exactly your usual battlefield, is it?

389
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:43,250
接着说
Go on.

390
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:47,660
在这种情况下 依我看
In an instance like this, it seems to me

391
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:52,160
你最好要弄清楚对手最害怕的是什么
that you'd do well to identify what it is that your opponent most fears.

392
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:54,540
-然后利用这一点  -不是
-And exploit it? -No.

393
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:58,660
是要给他们一种掌控这种恐惧的方法
Give them a means of mastering it.

394
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:02,370
这样你就可以掌控对手
So that you can master them.

395
00:37:02,450 --> 00:37:04,580
所以按照你的标准 我在这个牢房
So by your standards, I'm in this cell,

396
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:07,120
是因为我还没有找出 女王最害怕什么
because I've yet to identify what the queen most fears?

397
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,870
你只达到了低标准 但没错
My very low standards. Yes.

398
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:11,660
你只见了女王一小会儿 看来你已经确定了她最害怕什么
And I suppose you did, having met her for all of a few moments?

399
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:16,500
会面期间 你索要了船只 侮辱了她的人民、违抗了她的命令
During which you managed to demand a ship, insult her people, defy her orders,

400
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:18,290
但这些都没有让她情绪起伏
none of which quickened her pulse.

401
00:37:19,330 --> 00:37:22,160
现在 突然间 她把你扔进了牢房
Now, all of a sudden, she throws you in a cell.

402
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:24,950
为什么
Why?

403
00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:27,540
我请求她为你的人民而战
I asked her to fight for your people.

404
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:30,790
但这不是引起她愤怒的原因吧
But that wasn't what provoked her anger, was it?

405
00:37:33,330 --> 00:37:35,500
我要求和她父亲会面
I demanded to speak with her father.

406
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:41,000
多年来 没有人见过的 塔中的国王
The king in the tower, whom no one has seen in years.

407
00:37:43,870 --> 00:37:48,450
现在你知道停止奔跑 给自己 一点时间思考 会发生什么了吧
See what happens when you stop galloping and you give yourself a moment to think?

408
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:50,160
别再把我比作一匹马了
Cease comparing me to a horse.

409
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:53,120
作为交换 那你别再说服我离开这座岛了
Cease trying to convince me to leave this island an you have a deal.

410
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,620
请注意 精灵
Salutations, Elf.

411
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:57,410
摄政女王做出了决定
The Queen Regent has rendered her decision.

412
00:37:58,370 --> 00:38:02,790
今晚 你将在武装护送下 被运回精灵的领地
You are to be shipped back to the Elves under armed escort. Tonight.

413
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:18,000
向前一步
Step forward.

414
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:36,000
-我不建议你这样做 -我不能让她就这样离开
-I wouldn't advise that. -I can't very well let her leave.

415
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,870
你如果知道她要去哪里的话 你肯定会放她走
-You could. If you knew exactly where she was going.

416
00:39:00,830 --> 00:39:02,500
你来这上面干什么
What are you doing up here?

417
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:05,000
我刚跟人约会吃饭去了
I had a dinner.

418
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:10,000
跟谁
Who is he?

419
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,290
你的制服呢
Where's your uniform?

420
00:39:15,290 --> 00:39:17,500
你是辞职不当学员了吗
Resigned from the cadets, did you?

421
00:39:18,330 --> 00:39:19,750
不是 比这更糟糕
No, worse.

422
00:39:19,830 --> 00:39:21,330
你被开除了
You got dismissed?

423
00:39:22,410 --> 00:39:23,750
我害得我们几个都被开除了
Got us all dismissed.

424
00:39:23,830 --> 00:39:25,080
伊熙尔…
Isil...

425
00:39:28,790 --> 00:39:32,450
好吧 你赢了 现在你可以去西部了
Well, you've won. Now you can go west.

426
00:39:35,410 --> 00:39:37,370
我毁了朋友们的生活
I just ruined my friends' lives,

427
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:40,500
羞辱了家门
shamed our family name.

428
00:39:42,290 --> 00:39:43,950
我不配去西部
I don't deserve to go west.

429
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:49,870
再说了 父亲不会让我带走贝雷克的
-Plus, Father won't let me take Berek.

430
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:57,750
是那个精灵 她逃出来了
It's the Elf! She's escaped.

431
00:39:58,250 --> 00:39:59,580
仔细搜查每一个小巷
Search every alley.

432
00:40:19,330 --> 00:40:22,500
抱歉 陛下 打扰了 但是我…
Apologies, Your Majesty, for the intrusion. But I...

433
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:24,290
他已经没法再回应了
He no longer answers to that.

434
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:33,870
你怎么知道我会来这里
How did you know I would come here?

435
00:40:33,950 --> 00:40:37,620
外面有一支驻军等着护送你上船
A garrison of troops awaits outside to escort you to your ship.

436
00:40:38,830 --> 00:40:40,910
你放聪明点 自己主动离开
You would be wise to go willingly.

437
00:40:42,410 --> 00:40:43,500
弥瑞尔
Míriel.

438
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,200
弥瑞尔
Míriel.

439
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:01,750
我…
I... I...

440
00:41:01,830 --> 00:41:04,410
没事的 父亲 我在呢
-It's all right, Father. I'm here.

441
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:09,330
请原谅我
Forgive me.

442
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,370
我不知道是这个情况
I did not know.

443
00:41:13,450 --> 00:41:15,870
没几个人知道 他身体恶化到了这种地步
Few know the full extent of his decline.

444
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:20,120
我希望继续瞒着所有人
I should like to keep it that way.

445
00:41:20,790 --> 00:41:23,200
那我们俩之间就开诚布公吧
Then it is time for truth between us.

446
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,660
你父亲之前忠于精灵
Your father was loyal to the Elvish ways.

447
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:31,040
你为什么不愿意
Why are you not?

448
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,540
告诉我
Tell me.

449
00:41:35,870 --> 00:41:37,120
拜托了
Please.

450
00:41:39,450 --> 00:41:42,160
我父亲以前对他的信念总是很克制
My father was always restrained in his beliefs.

451
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:46,120
但在他加冕之后 情况发生了变化
But after his coronation, something changed.

452
00:41:48,250 --> 00:41:50,370
他开始变得很强硬
He became strident,

453
00:41:50,450 --> 00:41:54,120
宣称我们激怒了维拉
proclaiming that we'd provoked the anger of the Valar,

454
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:57,870
宣称我们必须悔改 回归往日的道路
and must repent, and return to the old ways.

455
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:01,120
有民众对此感到不安
There was unease.

456
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:05,870
而当我父亲宣布 计划与精灵再续友好关系时…
And when he announced plans to renew relations with the Elves...

457
00:42:05,950 --> 00:42:07,370
民众造反了
The people rebelled.

458
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:11,580
损失惨重
Much was lost.

459
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:17,040
我被选中接替他的统治
I was chosen to rule in his stead,

460
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:20,250
承诺要平息动乱
with a promise to quell the storm.

461
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:25,830
但我继位的第一个晚上 等努门诺尔人都睡着了
But that first night, as all Númenor slept,

462
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:27,580
父亲把我带到了这里
he brought me here.

463
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:34,200
帕蓝提尔
Palantír.

464
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:37,660
曾经有七颗真知晶石
Seven Seeing Stones there once were.

465
00:42:38,330 --> 00:42:40,910
其他六颗丢的丢 藏的藏
The other six either lost or hidden.

466
00:42:41,910 --> 00:42:43,950
这一颗传给了我父亲
This one was passed to my father.

467
00:42:44,790 --> 00:42:46,660
它有一个秘密
And with it, a secret.

468
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:51,200
把你的手放在上面
Place your hand upon it.

469
00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:57,660
-我得警告你… -我以前触摸过帕蓝提尔
-I must warn you... -I have touched palantíri before.

470
00:42:57,750 --> 00:42:59,750
但你没有碰过这一颗
But you have not touched this one.

471
00:43:28,870 --> 00:43:30,700
你刚才看到的是努门诺尔的未来
It is Númenor's future you saw.

472
00:43:34,830 --> 00:43:36,830
帕蓝提尔能呈现出很多异象
Palantíri show many visions.

473
00:43:37,750 --> 00:43:39,750
但有些异象永远不会发生
Some that will never come to pass.

474
00:43:39,830 --> 00:43:41,620
它已经发生了
It has already come to pass.

475
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:44,660
自打你来到这里 这个异象就开始了
The vision begins with your arrival.

476
00:43:45,330 --> 00:43:48,330
你认为我会导致努门诺尔的覆灭吗
And you believe I will bring about Númenor's downfall?

477
00:43:48,410 --> 00:43:51,000
只有努门诺尔才能让自己覆灭
Only Númenor can bring about her downfall.

478
00:43:52,250 --> 00:43:55,080
在一个恩德圆满的日子 维拉将这座岛屿赐予了我们
The Valar gifted us this isle in a day of virtue.

479
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:58,790
倘若我们调头走向黑暗 那他们大可把这座岛屿收回
They can take it away should we turn to the paths of darkness.

480
00:43:58,870 --> 00:44:02,830
你所说的恩德 就是你祖先对精灵的忠诚
The virtue you speak of was your ancestors' loyalty to the Elves.

481
00:44:02,910 --> 00:44:04,910
我父亲对此深信不疑
My father believed that.

482
00:44:05,910 --> 00:44:07,910
而他带领的路差点让我们毁于一旦
His path nearly destroyed us.

483
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:13,000
这就是为什么 明天我要宣布你已经走了
That is why, tomorrow, I will announce that you are gone.

484
00:44:13,790 --> 00:44:15,200
同时宣布这场危机结束
And this crisis ended.

485
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:21,160
如果对中洲 正在崛起的邪恶势力放任不管
If the evil rising in Middle-earth is left unchecked,

486
00:44:21,250 --> 00:44:23,910
那它必然扩散 毁灭我们所有人
it will spread and take us all.

487
00:44:24,410 --> 00:44:27,830
刻意避免这场战争 可能恰恰就是导致你们覆灭的原因
Avoiding this war may be the very thing that brings about your downfall.

488
00:44:27,910 --> 00:44:31,080
我不会质疑诸神 这就是我最后的决定
I will not second-guess the gods. My decision is final.

489
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:32,950
是出于恐惧而做的决定吧
A decision based in fear.

490
00:44:34,790 --> 00:44:38,330
我知道作为唯一知情的人 是什么样的感受
I know what it is to be the only one,

491
00:44:40,370 --> 00:44:42,200
唯有自己能看到
the only one who sees,

492
00:44:42,950 --> 00:44:44,790
唯有自己才知情
the only one who knows.

493
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:49,790
也许我们俩 都不必再独自承担这个负担了
Perhaps neither of us have to bear that burden alone any longer.

494
00:44:50,250 --> 00:44:54,580
我求你了 弥瑞尔 不要选择恐惧的那条道路
I beg of you, Míriel, choose not the path of fear,

495
00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:56,250
要选择充满信念的那条路
but that of faith.

496
00:44:56,870 --> 00:44:58,370
和我站在一起
Stand with me.

497
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:02,080
让努门诺尔再次与精灵并肩作战
Let Númenor fight alongside the Elves once more.

498
00:45:11,950 --> 00:45:15,370
内心可以遵从信念 加拉德瑞尔
Faith may bind one heart, Galadriel.

499
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:19,500
但要让一个王国只依靠信念 实在是有点靠不住
But it is too fine a thread from which to hang a kingdom.

500
00:45:22,250 --> 00:45:23,450
抱歉
I'm sorry.

501
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:34,080
树林都是光秃秃的 动物也都四散逃走了
Woods are all bare. Animals are all fled.

502
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:36,910
看来你的孩子比我们原以为的更聪明
Seems your boy had more sense than we allowed.

503
00:45:38,830 --> 00:45:40,580
门口有人
-There's someone at the gates!

504
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:46,750
退后
Stand back.

505
00:45:46,830 --> 00:45:49,540
-别挡路 退后  -让这小伙子过去
-Move out of the way. Stand back! -Let the lad through!

506
00:45:51,370 --> 00:45:53,120
有很多吃的 慢点
There's plenty. Slow down!

507
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:55,580
罗恩 希奥在哪
Rowan! Where's Theo?

508
00:45:57,540 --> 00:45:59,120
他刚才说会紧跟着我
He said he'd be right behind me.

509
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:00,450
-好饿  -别推了
-I'm so hungry! -Stop pushing!

510
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:01,750
她推我
She pushed me!

511
00:46:04,370 --> 00:46:08,250
我们把每个角落都检查过了 他没回来
We've turned over every stone. He ain't back here.

512
00:46:08,330 --> 00:46:09,500
走吧
-Come on.

513
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:15,790
他在哪里
Where is he?

514
00:46:18,450 --> 00:46:19,750
他不在这里
He's not here!

515
00:46:23,540 --> 00:46:24,370
我们走
Let's go.

516
00:46:27,290 --> 00:46:29,540
仔细搜查 不留死角
Leave no stone unturned.

517
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:35,290
要是找不到他 老大会活剥了我们的皮
Boss will skin us alive if we don't find him.

518
00:46:35,370 --> 00:46:38,160
是老大最先把他弄丢的啊
Boss is the one who lost him in the first place.

519
00:46:38,250 --> 00:46:40,700
我闻到他的气味了…
Izm?mbogh...

520
00:46:43,450 --> 00:46:44,750
快过来
Come on!

521
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:50,870
快搜
Kishdibatoth! Kishdibatoth.

522
00:47:04,290 --> 00:47:05,750
快搜
Kishdibatoth.

523
00:47:11,330 --> 00:47:12,410
把他找出来
Find him!

524
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,290
不在这里
Nothin' here.

525
00:47:35,910 --> 00:47:38,080
在那边 看
-Over there! Look!

526
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:03,080
小鲜肉 你急着要跑去哪儿啊
Going somewhere, young blood, are we?

527
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:04,250
那把剑在哪里
Where is it?

528
00:48:04,330 --> 00:48:05,330
不要
No!

529
00:48:05,410 --> 00:48:07,500
你从哪儿弄到的
Where have you got it?

530
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:12,540
砍掉你一只手臂 看你开不开口
Maybe losing your arm will loosen your lips.

531
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:25,120
动作快点 小伙子
-Swiftly, lad. -Over there! Get him!

532
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,330
他们来了
They are coming.

533
00:48:53,330 --> 00:48:54,330
继续跑
Keep going.

534
00:49:20,790 --> 00:49:21,790
快跑
Run!

535
00:49:36,290 --> 00:49:37,450
妈妈
Mother?

536
00:49:38,950 --> 00:49:40,120
布隆温
Bronwyn.

537
00:49:43,830 --> 00:49:45,700
快跑 去空地
Run! Get to the clearing!

538
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:14,330
刚才这是干什么
What was that?

539
00:52:14,870 --> 00:52:17,500
是在恳求岩石
It was a plea to the rocks

540
00:52:17,580 --> 00:52:21,500
请它保佑矿工还有呼吸 能够安全逃生
to release the bodies of the miners with breath still inside them.

541
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,950
我一直在想 要不是你去矿井找他
I cannot stop thinking that if you'd not gone down there,

542
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:29,790
都林很有可能会在那个竖井里…
Durin might have been in that shaft when it...

543
00:52:31,370 --> 00:52:32,450
对不起
I'm sorry.

544
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:34,660
对不起 我骗了你
I'm sorry I lied to you.

545
00:52:34,750 --> 00:52:38,330
你不告诉我也是为了都林好 我们只要记住这个就可以了
You were faithful to my friend. -That is all we need remember.

546
00:52:40,540 --> 00:52:42,580
他们刚把最后一名矿工拖了出来
They just pulled out the last one.

547
00:52:44,410 --> 00:52:47,370
活着 他们都活着
-Alive. All of them alive.

548
00:52:48,330 --> 00:52:50,250
你父亲肯定松了一口气
Your father must be so relieved.

549
00:52:50,330 --> 00:52:51,750
他把矿井关停了
He shut it down.

550
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:56,120
整条矿脉都要被封死了
The whole vein is to be sealed off.

551
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:58,120
-整条矿脉  -一整条
-The whole vein? -All of it.

552
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:00,500
给他点时间嘛
Give him time.

553
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:04,000
脾气再大 气也总会消的
Even the hottest coals eventually cool.

554
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:06,500
是啊 但有时候 我倒是希望他一直在气头上
Yeah, but sometimes I wish they wouldn't.

555
00:53:07,750 --> 00:53:11,370
有时候我真希望 能告诉父亲我对他的真实看法
Sometimes I wish I could tell him exactly what I think of him,

556
00:53:12,370 --> 00:53:16,950
然后再也不和那个糟老头子说话了
and never trade words with the old goat again!

557
00:53:41,250 --> 00:53:44,040
我父亲曾经独自航行到维林诺
My father single-handedly sailed to Valinor,

558
00:53:45,250 --> 00:53:49,870
说服维拉加入战争 并成功消灭魔苟斯
and convinced the Valar to join the war and vanquish Morgoth.

559
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:53,200
他的事迹如此伟大
So great were his deeds

560
00:53:53,290 --> 00:53:56,790
以至于维拉 把他带到了这个世界的边界之外…
that the Valar lifted him beyond the bounds of this world...

561
00:53:57,620 --> 00:54:00,330
永远带着暮色之星划过天空
To forever carry the Evening Star across the sky.

562
00:54:03,660 --> 00:54:06,830
这么多年来 每到深夜 我都会抬头看看它…
For many years, at day's end, I would look up at it...

563
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:13,200
想知道如果他在看着我 他会怎么想
Wondering what might he think if he were watching me.

564
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:18,620
他会为我在他的传承之上 取得的成就而感到骄傲吗
Would he be proud of what I've accomplished with his legacy?

565
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:26,290
还是会因为我未能达到 他的种种期望而对我感到失望
Or disappointed by the countless ways I'd failed to live up to it?

566
00:54:31,250 --> 00:54:34,040
但后来有一天晚上 我突然想到
But then, one night, it struck me

567
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:37,080
只要能听到他的评价 无论好坏 我都能心满意足
that I would be only too happy to hear any judgment,

568
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:39,410
我只求获得再次与父亲说话的机会
so long as it granted me the opportunity

569
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:42,500
哪怕只有一次也好
to have but one more conversation with my father.

570
00:54:43,830 --> 00:54:47,830
不要浪费你和父亲所剩不多的时间
Do not waste what time you have left with yours.

571
00:54:57,660 --> 00:55:01,870
埃尔隆德 我期待你能解答一些问题
Elrond, I was hopeful you might be able to settle something.

572
00:55:02,660 --> 00:55:05,160
你和我老公是怎么认识的
How is it that you and my husband met?

573
00:55:05,250 --> 00:55:07,830
我告诉过你 我把他从山岭食人妖手中救了出来
I told you, I saved him from a hill-troll.

574
00:55:07,910 --> 00:55:10,250
-是两个山岭食人妖哦 -两个 对 我知道
-Two of 'em. -Two of 'em. Yes, I know.

575
00:55:11,790 --> 00:55:13,330
我是在问埃尔隆德
I was asking Elrond.

576
00:55:13,750 --> 00:55:17,750
那恐怕我别无选择 只能纠正一下你丈夫的描述
Then I fear I have no choice but to amend your husband's account.

577
00:55:17,830 --> 00:55:20,580
当时有三个山岭食人妖 而且是我救的他
There were three trolls. And it was I who saved him.

578
00:55:20,660 --> 00:55:24,080
你也不照照镜子看看自己长什么样子
You wouldn't remember your face if you were gazing in a mirror.

579
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:25,910
当时我在森林里遇见他
When I came upon him in the forest,

580
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,450
他正在躲避山岭食人妖的槌击
he was in the midst of dodging their mallet blows.

581
00:55:28,540 --> 00:55:30,160
他就在那里嚎啕大哭什么的
-Wailing and screaming and such.

582
00:55:30,290 --> 00:55:31,500
我那是战场的呐喊
-It was a battle cry.

583
00:55:31,580 --> 00:55:35,250
他的喊叫声非常尖锐 我当时还以为是个小孩 我拿着弓…
The screams were so high-pitched, I thought it was a child. So I took up my bow...

584
00:55:35,330 --> 00:55:36,830
-是一把剑 -是一把弓
-Uh, it was a sword. -It was a bow.

585
00:55:36,950 --> 00:55:38,700
-不 是一把剑  -不管怎么样…
-Nah! It was a sword! -Regardless...

586
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:46,750
原谅我 父亲
Forgive me, Father.

587
00:55:47,540 --> 00:55:52,080
我太过骄傲、固执 我错了
I was proud and stubborn and I was wrong.

588
00:55:57,660 --> 00:55:59,450
你就不能看我一眼吗
Can you not even look at me?

589
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:13,200
我们矮人相信…
Our people believe...

590
00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:17,410
当新的矮人国王加冕时
That when a new Dwarf-king is crowned,

591
00:56:18,660 --> 00:56:22,040
所有祖先的声音都会汇集在他心头
the voices of all his forebearers flow into him,

592
00:56:24,410 --> 00:56:26,660
与他分享前辈们的经验
sharing with him their counsel

593
00:56:27,580 --> 00:56:29,000
以及智慧
and wisdom.

594
00:56:30,750 --> 00:56:32,370
甚至还有错误
-Even their mistakes.

595
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:40,500
但你…
But you...

596
00:56:42,580 --> 00:56:45,830
你不必等到那一天 就能听到我的声音
You need not wait for that day to hear my voice.

597
00:56:50,580 --> 00:56:55,160
因为 儿子 我永远和你在一起
For, ever am I with you, my son.

598
00:56:58,830 --> 00:57:00,080
即便我非常愤怒
Even in anger.

599
00:57:01,870 --> 00:57:03,950
有的时候 我基本上一直在发怒
Sometimes, in anger most of all.

600
00:57:08,450 --> 00:57:10,450
你没什么需要我原谅的
There is nothing to forgive.

601
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:31,250
埃尔隆德邀请我明天和他一起去林顿
Elrond has invited me to go with him to Lindon tomorrow.

602
00:57:36,290 --> 00:57:37,620
我应该接受吗
Shall I accept?

603
00:57:39,540 --> 00:57:42,370
埃尔隆德保证 吉尔加拉德派他来这里并没有恶意
Elrond has been very convincing in his assurances

604
00:57:42,450 --> 00:57:45,790
埃尔隆德的话让人非常信服
that Gil-galad bore no ill intent when he sent him here.

605
00:57:45,870 --> 00:57:49,160
是的 的确是
Aye. He has.

606
00:57:50,290 --> 00:57:52,540
但直觉是一种强有力的辅助
But intuition's a powerful tonic.

607
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:55,540
你的直觉如何
What does yours tell you?

608
00:57:56,790 --> 00:57:58,830
感觉事有蹊跷
There is something more at work.

609
00:57:58,910 --> 00:58:00,000
好样的 儿子
Good, my son.

610
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:02,200
很好
Good.

611
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:05,370
去林顿吧
Go to Lindon.

612
00:58:06,790 --> 00:58:08,120
看看是怎么回事
Find out what.

613
00:58:24,910 --> 00:58:26,080
谢谢你
Thank you.

614
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,410
怎么了 出什么事了
What is it? What's wrong?

615
00:58:38,950 --> 00:58:43,290
敌人的指挥官让我带回来一条口信
I have a message. From the one who commands our enemy.

616
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:50,080
你的人民要想保全性命 必须放弃这些土地的所有权…
That your people may live if you forsake all claim to these lands...

617
00:58:51,660 --> 00:58:53,080
并向他宣誓效忠
And swear fealty to him.

618
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:56,910
如果我们拒绝呢
And if we refuse?

619
00:58:58,410 --> 00:58:59,910
那他就会来欧斯提力斯
He's coming for Ostirith.

620
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:40,290
来吧
-Come on.

621
00:59:45,870 --> 00:59:49,450
要我说 你的所做作为 配得上喝一口好酒作为奖赏
If you ask me, you deserve a nip of mash after what you done.

622
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:52,000
给 拿着吧
Go on, take it.

623
00:59:52,580 --> 00:59:56,660
就像你从我谷仓里 拿走了那把剑一样
Just like you took that hilt from me barn.

624
00:59:57,250 --> 00:59:58,450
我不知道你说什么...
Uh... I don't know what...

625
00:59:58,540 --> 01:00:00,040
别装了 小伙子
Come off it, lad.

626
01:00:00,750 --> 01:00:02,580
你知道我说的是什么
You know of what I speak.

627
01:00:14,080 --> 01:00:17,540
你知道这是什么吗 这并不是剑
Do you know what it is? It is no sword.

628
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:19,410
而是一种力量
It is a power.

629
01:00:20,290 --> 01:00:24,790
由他的主人亲手为我们的祖先打造
Fashioned for our ancestors by his master's own hand.

630
01:00:25,290 --> 01:00:27,830
一个漂亮的仆人
A beautiful servant.

631
01:00:27,910 --> 01:00:31,500
他曾经不知所踪 但终将归来
He who was lost, but shall return.

632
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:34,790
小伙子 你听说过他吗
Have you heard of him, lad?

633
01:00:35,750 --> 01:00:37,250
你听说过索隆吗
Have you heard of Sauron?

634
01:00:41,910 --> 01:00:44,790
你肯定在天上看到过
You must have seen it in the skies.

635
01:00:44,870 --> 01:00:46,450
几周前
A few weeks back now.

636
01:00:47,540 --> 01:00:48,790
星陨
The starfall.

637
01:00:48,870 --> 01:00:50,700
这意味着他的时间快到了
It means his time is near.

638
01:00:51,830 --> 01:00:55,660
小伙子 这需要你和我共同做好准备
And it is to you and me, lad, to be ready.

639
01:00:55,750 --> 01:00:57,120
准备好什么
Ready for what?

640
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:59,500
安静点 小伙子
Hush now, lad.

641
01:01:00,410 --> 01:01:02,250
你保存好体力
You save your strength.

642
01:01:03,580 --> 01:01:05,000
接下来要发生的事
You'll need it.

643
01:01:06,620 --> 01:01:08,040
会非常消耗体力的
For what's coming.

644
01:01:22,830 --> 01:01:24,410
父亲大人
Lord-father...

645
01:01:26,120 --> 01:01:27,620
我们找到了
We found it.

646
01:01:29,370 --> 01:01:31,200
在那座塔里
It's in the tower.

647
01:01:56,450 --> 01:01:58,250
安心去吧
Go in peace.

648
01:02:41,790 --> 01:02:44,000
你的人民会感到宽慰
Your people will be relieved.

649
01:02:44,370 --> 01:02:46,450
他们很快就会聚集在王宫里
They will be gathering soon in the court,

650
01:02:46,540 --> 01:02:48,700
聚集在广场上 聆听你的宣告
and in the plaza, to hear your announcement.

651
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:54,040
那我们就别让他们久等了
Then we ought not to keep them.

652
01:04:05,790 --> 01:04:09,120
忠贞派相信 白树的花瓣落下
The faithful believe that when the petals of the White Tree fall

653
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:11,000
是重要的预兆…
it is no idle thing,

654
01:04:11,080 --> 01:04:13,950
但是维拉的眼泪
but the very tears of the Valar themselves,

655
01:04:14,370 --> 01:04:19,250
鲜活地提醒着我们 他们时刻紧盯我们 审判我们
a living reminder that their eyes and their judgment are ever upon us.

656
01:04:20,450 --> 01:04:23,870
现在 人类命运迎来了 一个决定性的时刻
There is a fateful hour in the destinies of men.

657
01:04:24,540 --> 01:04:25,790
一个审判的时刻
An hour of judgment

658
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:31,160
在这之中 我们所有人、每个人
in which each of us, every one,

659
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:35,250
都必须决定自己将要成为谁
must decide who we shall be.

660
01:04:36,200 --> 01:04:40,500
我们的心会像 小岛周围的石像一样铁石心肠
Are our hearts become as the statues that surround our isle?

661
01:04:40,950 --> 01:04:44,830
还是会同石像雕刻的 英雄一般充满满腔热忱
Or do they yet beat with the blood of the heroes that carved them?

662
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:51,370
我们的勇气 是否只存在于父辈的坟墓之中
Is our valor confined to the graves of our slumbering fathers?

663
01:04:53,500 --> 01:04:54,870
还是说就在这里
Or is it here,

664
01:04:56,790 --> 01:04:58,580
就在我们众人之中…
amongst us even now...

665
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,410
等待随着太阳升起而迸发
Waiting to burst forth as the rising Sun?

666
01:05:11,450 --> 01:05:16,750
我不会让你们去面对 连我自己都不敢直面的危险
I would neither command, nor invite you to any danger I myself would not face.

667
01:05:17,540 --> 01:05:22,160
所以 我决定亲自护送精灵返回中洲
And so, I've decided to personally escort the Elf back to Middle-earth.

668
01:05:29,620 --> 01:05:35,080
援助被围困在南方大地的凡人同胞
To aid our mortal brethren who are now besieged in the Southlands.

669
01:05:35,160 --> 01:05:37,200
女王已经明确表明意图
Your queen has laid bare her intent.

670
01:05:37,290 --> 01:05:39,500
我们的船队将在十天后启程
Our ships will depart in ten days.
