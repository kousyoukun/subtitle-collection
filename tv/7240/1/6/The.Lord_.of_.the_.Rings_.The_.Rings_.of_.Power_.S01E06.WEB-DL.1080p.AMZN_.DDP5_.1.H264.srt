1
00:00:06,666 --> 00:00:09,291
Summon the legions. It is time.

2
00:00:09,666 --> 00:00:11,458
Our enemy vows to attack.

3
00:00:11,541 --> 00:00:14,541
Who among you will stand and fight?

4
00:00:14,625 --> 00:00:15,833
You will die.

5
00:00:15,916 --> 00:00:18,250
<i>Long have I awaited this day.</i>

6
00:00:18,333 --> 00:00:21,375
I pledge my loyalty to Sauron.

7
00:00:22,375 --> 00:00:23,583
Half of us just left.

8
00:00:23,666 --> 00:00:25,041
But half stayed.

9
00:00:25,333 --> 00:00:27,000
<i>Why wasn't I chosen
for the expedition?</i>

10
00:00:27,083 --> 00:00:28,666
Thought you were going west.

11
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:30,916
Not till I've done something
worthy of Númenor.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,916
<i>I have just convinced Númenor
to send five ships</i>

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,666
<i>and 500 men to aid your people</i>

14
00:00:36,791 --> 00:00:38,500
<i>and place a crown upon your head.</i>

15
00:00:38,583 --> 00:00:41,583
You are asking me to go to the one place
that I swore never to return.

16
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:43,666
Why do you keep fighting?

17
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:45,375
Because I cannot stop.

18
00:00:45,958 --> 00:00:49,250
<i>Come with me, and together we will
redeem both our bloodlines.</i>

19
00:00:50,916 --> 00:00:52,250
We head nor'-east.

20
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,041
For Middle-earth.

21
00:00:57,208 --> 00:00:59,791
<i>It is no sword. It is a power.</i>

22
00:00:59,875 --> 00:01:01,250
Have you heard of Sauron?

23
00:01:02,666 --> 00:01:03,958
<i>I've seen this before.</i>

24
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:05,500
<i>It is a key.</i>

25
00:01:06,083 --> 00:01:09,583
<i>The enemy commander spoke of
giving the Orcs a home in these lands.</i>

26
00:01:09,708 --> 00:01:11,833
<i>Whatever his design, this much is certain.</i>

27
00:01:12,333 --> 00:01:15,333
<i>Our enemy knows your son
has what he needs to enact it.</i>

28
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:17,375
<i>How long?</i>

29
00:01:18,458 --> 00:01:19,458
<i>Maybe hours.</i>

30
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:27,583
New life.

31
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:32,000
In defiance of death.

32
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:52,083
My children,

33
00:03:53,916 --> 00:03:56,625
we have endured much.

34
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:04,291
We cast off our shackles.

35
00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:09,958
Crossed mountain, field,

36
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,666
frost, and fallow

37
00:04:13,291 --> 00:04:15,250
till our feet bloodied the dirt.

38
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,666
From <i>Ered Mithrin</i> to the <i>Ephel Arnen,</i>

39
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:26,291
we have endured.

40
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:35,416
Yet tonight, one more trial awaits us.

41
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:41,583
Our enemy may be weak,
their numbers meager...

42
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:48,500
...yet before this night is through,
some of us will fall.

43
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:52,833
But for the first time, you do so

44
00:04:53,708 --> 00:04:58,083
not as unnamed slaves in far-away lands,

45
00:04:58,166 --> 00:04:59,583
but as brothers.

46
00:05:01,416 --> 00:05:04,458
As brothers and sisters in our home!

47
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:09,583
<i>Nampat.</i>

48
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:11,958
<i>Nampat! Nampat!</i>

49
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:13,416
This is the night

50
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:17,041
- we reach out the iron hand of the <i>Uruk...</i>
<i>- Nampat! Nampat!</i>

51
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:19,750
...and close our fist around these lands.

52
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:21,500
<i>Nampat!</i>

53
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:25,000
<i>Nampat!</i>

54
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:29,208
<i>Nampat!</i>

55
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:33,166
<i>Nampat!</i>

56
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:10,791
Search it.

57
00:06:11,166 --> 00:06:17,166
All of you! Fan out! Find them!

58
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,208
Meaning no offense,
Lord-father, but where is he?

59
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:06,958
What happened to Sauron?

60
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:13,875
Can't find tooth nor tail of him.
Must've got smart and scarpered.

61
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:18,250
No. The Elf's here.

62
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:20,833
I smell him.

63
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:22,000
Yes, Father.

64
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:23,750
Up here!

65
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:31,208
Bring him down!

66
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:48,500
Get out, now!

67
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:04,375
Open that door!

68
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:13,208
Get out!

69
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:18,541
Lord-father! You must move now!

70
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:20,416
You must move!

71
00:08:37,666 --> 00:08:39,916
How many of 'em
could have survived that?

72
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,458
How long do we have?

73
00:08:43,291 --> 00:08:44,500
Not long enough.

74
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:48,041
Come on,
we have to make ready the village.

75
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:36,750
Easy, Berek. Easy, boy.

76
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:50,958
Hoist it up!

77
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:06,833
I thought all soldiers
were to be abed.

78
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:08,875
Pardon me, Commander. I... I was only...

79
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:11,291
Hoping to get the first sight of land?

80
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:13,375
At ease.

81
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:17,458
It'll be visible to your eyes
in a few moments.

82
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:20,708
Is it visible to yours already?

83
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:23,750
Has been for nearly an hour.

84
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:26,833
Keen are the eyes of the Elves.

85
00:10:26,916 --> 00:10:30,166
And yet, mine have not before seen you.

86
00:10:31,125 --> 00:10:33,208
Swinging steel nor flying sail.

87
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,750
What is your rank?

88
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,416
Stable sweep.

89
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:44,916
Despise not the labor
which humbles the heart.

90
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,791
Humility has saved entire kingdoms
the proud have all but led to ruin.

91
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:52,916
I did not join this expedition
to be humbled, Commander.

92
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,750
Then for what did you join, soldier?

93
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:57,458
I was just trying to get away.

94
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:00,625
As far as I could from that place.

95
00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:01,875
Númenor?

96
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:04,458
It's not Númenor.

97
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:07,083
Not the real Númenor, anyway.

98
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:09,208
If it ever existed.

99
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:10,875
It existed.

100
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:14,083
It exists still...

101
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:16,791
If only in the heart
of the lowliest stable sweep.

102
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:19,208
It's Isildur.

103
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:21,708
I might have known.

104
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:26,041
You have the look of your father.

105
00:11:27,916 --> 00:11:30,541
I was always told I look
more like my mother.

106
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:50,708
Soldier.

107
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:55,000
Captain.

108
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:05,000
His mother...

109
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:09,791
What happened to her?

110
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,166
It is strange.

111
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:22,250
Most of my life, I've looked east
to see the Sun rise over the sea.

112
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:25,958
And west to see it set over the land.

113
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:28,541
We're sailing into the dawn,
and yet, to me,

114
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,291
it feels like the coming of night.

115
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:41,166
She drowned.

116
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:56,291
<i>Land has been sighted,
Your Majesty.</i>

117
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:58,083
<i>How long before we make anchor?</i>

118
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,416
It's a full day's sail
into the mountains.

119
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:05,958
And from there, another day's ride
east into the vale.

120
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:08,041
Signal the other ships.

121
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:10,375
Tell them to make all possible haste.

122
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,375
It is beyond our skill to destroy.

123
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:02,125
Where will you hide it?

124
00:14:05,916 --> 00:14:07,458
No one must know.

125
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:14,500
Not even you.

126
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,333
<i>Our enemy has been sighted.</i>

127
00:14:29,666 --> 00:14:31,083
<i>We survived them before.</i>

128
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:34,458
<i>Now we must do so again.</i>

129
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:40,000
Tonight.

130
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:44,250
Our position gives us an advantage.

131
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:50,500
<i>But to use it,
we must draw the enemy in close.</i>

132
00:14:53,416 --> 00:14:55,500
We must wait until every last Orc

133
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:58,083
has crossed that bridge
to spring our attack.

134
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:01,041
<i>This will test your nerve.</i>

135
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:04,958
<i>Let it.</i>

136
00:15:06,375 --> 00:15:09,875
All who cannot fight
will be barricaded inside.

137
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:13,000
This is to be our keep.
Our fallback point.

138
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:16,916
Take heart. All of you.

139
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:22,625
I have seen smaller armies
defeat greater foes.

140
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:25,416
Soon, the sun will set.

141
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:30,666
Do your part, and I swear to you,
you shall see it rise again.

142
00:15:31,875 --> 00:15:34,000
- Do you believe it?
- Aye.

143
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:37,625
- Do you believe it?
- Aye!

144
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,416
To your positions.

145
00:15:47,166 --> 00:15:48,250
What about me?

146
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:50,041
Tavern.

147
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:52,458
Tavern's for wounded and children.
I can fight.

148
00:15:52,541 --> 00:15:54,041
I know you can.

149
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:56,583
Which is why I need you in there,
protecting those who cannot.

150
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:05,750
Come.

151
00:16:11,291 --> 00:16:15,500
Remember when I was little...
When I used to have bad dreams?

152
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:17,875
I remember.

153
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:21,125
You remember what you used to say?

154
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,583
When you would hold me in the dark?

155
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:29,875
Would you say it to me now?

156
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:37,958
"In the end, this shadow
is but a small and passing thing.

157
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,916
"There is light and high beauty

158
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:47,041
"forever beyond its reach.

159
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:49,541
"Find the light...

160
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,875
"And the shadow will not find you."

161
00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:06,500
Farewell, Mother.

162
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:28,875
<i>Are you ready?</i>

163
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:33,500
No. Are you?

164
00:17:49,208 --> 00:17:50,708
The <i>alfirin</i> seeds...

165
00:17:54,666 --> 00:17:57,041
It is a tradition among Elves.

166
00:17:57,125 --> 00:18:00,541
Before the battle begins, plant one.

167
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:09,458
New life, in defiance of death?

168
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:31,875
It is believed that one of the Valar

169
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:36,708
watches over growing things...

170
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:46,791
And those who tend them.

171
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:55,791
The rest...

172
00:18:57,041 --> 00:18:59,416
we shall plant after the battle is over.

173
00:19:02,916 --> 00:19:04,333
In a new garden.

174
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:08,375
You and I.

175
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,166
And Theo.

176
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:14,875
Together.

177
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:18,875
Promise me.

178
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:09,583
They're here.

179
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:10,875
Oh, dear...

180
00:23:13,583 --> 00:23:16,333
The bleeding fools missed us.

181
00:23:46,333 --> 00:23:47,958
Come on!

182
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:51,875
They're headed for the tavern.

183
00:24:10,416 --> 00:24:13,708
- Fight for the South lands!
- Fight for the South lands!

184
00:27:21,208 --> 00:27:22,708
The land is ours!

185
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:35,666
More than a bit brave, Elf.
More than a bit.

186
00:28:19,375 --> 00:28:20,541
Bronwyn.

187
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:13,041
We were fighting our own.

188
00:29:16,541 --> 00:29:20,250
Thought we'd take 'em in
for nothin'?

189
00:29:21,291 --> 00:29:23,125
Had to pay the toll...

190
00:29:25,416 --> 00:29:29,458
And now, all of you will.

191
00:29:48,166 --> 00:29:49,000
Tredwill!

192
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:13,916
Mother!

193
00:30:16,583 --> 00:30:19,000
Everyone, to the keep!

194
00:30:21,208 --> 00:30:22,833
Go! Go!

195
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,375
Into the tavern!

196
00:30:34,375 --> 00:30:35,208
The tavern!

197
00:30:36,625 --> 00:30:38,125
All of you!

198
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:42,583
Go!

199
00:30:51,208 --> 00:30:52,541
The table!

200
00:30:52,625 --> 00:30:55,291
Hurry!

201
00:31:09,916 --> 00:31:11,333
Hurry!

202
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,583
Mother. Mother.

203
00:31:20,375 --> 00:31:22,041
Help him first.

204
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,625
No.

205
00:31:33,708 --> 00:31:35,250
We will help you.

206
00:31:36,833 --> 00:31:38,083
Mother.

207
00:31:38,166 --> 00:31:39,416
Theo...

208
00:31:41,541 --> 00:31:43,541
You'll have to stem the bleeding.

209
00:31:43,625 --> 00:31:44,833
I... I don't think I...

210
00:31:44,916 --> 00:31:48,083
Either you're gonna do this
or I'm gonna die. Do you understand?

211
00:31:50,875 --> 00:31:52,166
Theo.

212
00:32:05,125 --> 00:32:07,375
Mother, prepare yourself.

213
00:32:10,125 --> 00:32:11,250
I am sorry.

214
00:32:23,958 --> 00:32:25,583
Put pressure on the wound.

215
00:32:41,958 --> 00:32:42,791
Burn...

216
00:32:43,875 --> 00:32:46,416
She's cold.
She's lost too much blood.

217
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,083
No. No. No.

218
00:32:48,166 --> 00:32:49,666
She's saying "burn."

219
00:32:50,083 --> 00:32:53,041
The <i>alfirin</i> seeds.
We have to seal the wound with fire.

220
00:32:53,625 --> 00:32:55,708
Bring me some burning wood. Hurry!

221
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:05,958
Now.

222
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:11,125
Now.

223
00:33:16,791 --> 00:33:17,958
Now this side.

224
00:33:23,125 --> 00:33:24,208
Go on.

225
00:33:30,541 --> 00:33:31,541
That's enough.

226
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:46,500
Bronwyn?

227
00:33:47,916 --> 00:33:49,666
- Mother?
- Bronwyn?

228
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:51,958
Wake up! Mother!

229
00:34:25,291 --> 00:34:27,166
<i>Nampat!</i>

230
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:30,083
<i>Nampat!</i>

231
00:34:30,166 --> 00:34:31,250
<i>Nampat!</i>

232
00:34:32,916 --> 00:34:34,000
<i>Nampat!</i>

233
00:34:35,458 --> 00:34:36,541
<i>Nampat!</i>

234
00:34:37,958 --> 00:34:39,291
<i>Nampat!</i>

235
00:34:40,375 --> 00:34:41,458
<i>Nampat!</i>

236
00:34:42,166 --> 00:34:44,166
<i>- Kick 'em in the back!
- Nampat!</i>

237
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:46,625
<i>Nampat!</i>

238
00:34:48,166 --> 00:34:49,166
<i>Nampat!</i>

239
00:34:50,833 --> 00:34:51,875
<i>Nampat!</i>

240
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:54,208
Sit down!

241
00:36:31,416 --> 00:36:34,083
What I seek.

242
00:36:34,166 --> 00:36:35,833
Give it to me.

243
00:36:37,166 --> 00:36:38,583
Let them go.

244
00:36:41,541 --> 00:36:42,875
I will consider it.

245
00:36:55,583 --> 00:37:00,125
Why sacrifice
their lives for such a little thing?

246
00:37:21,416 --> 00:37:22,833
The woman next.

247
00:37:24,291 --> 00:37:25,375
No!

248
00:37:31,041 --> 00:37:32,208
- Wait!
- Theo!

249
00:37:34,333 --> 00:37:35,375
It's under here.

250
00:37:37,583 --> 00:37:39,166
It's under here.

251
00:37:43,375 --> 00:37:44,541
No.

252
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:56,500
Theo!

253
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,083
I'm sorry.

254
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,875
Waldreg, I have a task for you.

255
00:38:59,625 --> 00:39:01,875
They all must die.

256
00:40:18,458 --> 00:40:19,500
Ontamo!

257
00:40:48,458 --> 00:40:49,375
Go.

258
00:40:50,416 --> 00:40:51,416
Hyah!

259
00:41:01,875 --> 00:41:02,916
Hyah!

260
00:41:17,208 --> 00:41:18,458
Father!

261
00:41:28,541 --> 00:41:30,041
Father!

262
00:41:30,125 --> 00:41:32,166
- I'm all right.
- I thought you...

263
00:41:33,250 --> 00:41:34,666
I'm all right, Isil.

264
00:41:40,583 --> 00:41:42,166
Soldier.

265
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:43,250
Their commander?

266
00:41:47,625 --> 00:41:49,041
The item he possesses...

267
00:41:49,125 --> 00:41:50,875
He must not escape with it.

268
00:42:00,583 --> 00:42:01,750
Who is that?

269
00:42:05,416 --> 00:42:07,041
Commander
of the Northern Armies.

270
00:42:07,416 --> 00:42:09,375
Galadriel.

271
00:42:48,291 --> 00:42:50,875
<i>Noro lim!</i>

272
00:43:19,875 --> 00:43:20,958
Go!

273
00:44:00,333 --> 00:44:01,750
You remember me?

274
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:09,500
No.

275
00:44:23,458 --> 00:44:24,500
Stop!

276
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,333
We need him alive.

277
00:44:27,875 --> 00:44:29,500
I need him alive.

278
00:44:30,666 --> 00:44:32,291
You don't know what he did.

279
00:44:35,583 --> 00:44:41,458
Did I cause someone you love pain?

280
00:44:45,541 --> 00:44:46,791
A woman?

281
00:44:50,041 --> 00:44:54,250
Perhaps a child?

282
00:44:54,333 --> 00:44:55,916
Eat your tongue.

283
00:44:58,333 --> 00:45:01,333
Halbrand, put it down.

284
00:45:06,166 --> 00:45:09,166
One cannot satisfy thirst
by drinking sea water.

285
00:45:27,708 --> 00:45:29,041
So, what do you think?

286
00:45:33,375 --> 00:45:34,625
I like the mountains.

287
00:45:36,083 --> 00:45:38,583
You're about to get a closer look at them.

288
00:45:39,541 --> 00:45:41,958
Commander Galadriel's
putting together a company

289
00:45:42,041 --> 00:45:44,041
to track down the Orcs that escaped,

290
00:45:44,125 --> 00:45:46,666
and I managed to wheedle
the pair of us a spot.

291
00:45:46,750 --> 00:45:47,875
What about Ontamo?

292
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,458
I think I might stay here for a while.
Lend these folk a hand.

293
00:45:51,541 --> 00:45:55,416
- Seen enough battle for a week?
- More like a whole lifetime.

294
00:45:59,250 --> 00:46:01,833
This company, when's it set out?

295
00:46:02,708 --> 00:46:05,708
Don't know for certain.
Not till she's done with him.

296
00:46:10,541 --> 00:46:15,541
When I was a child, I heard stories
of Elves taken by Morgoth.

297
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,833
Tortured. Twisted.

298
00:46:21,875 --> 00:46:24,541
Made into a new and ruined form of life.

299
00:46:26,583 --> 00:46:29,000
You are one of them, are you not?

300
00:46:30,750 --> 00:46:32,333
The Moriondor.

301
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,583
The Sons of the Dark.

302
00:46:36,833 --> 00:46:38,875
The first Orcs.

303
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:40,708
<i>Uruk.</i>

304
00:46:45,041 --> 00:46:46,458
We prefer <i>"Uruk."</i>

305
00:46:46,541 --> 00:46:50,000
Even Moriondor take orders from a master.

306
00:46:50,083 --> 00:46:51,875
And I seek yours.

307
00:46:52,625 --> 00:46:53,708
Where is he?

308
00:46:54,916 --> 00:46:56,250
Where is Sauron?

309
00:47:06,083 --> 00:47:09,041
Perhaps we should bring our prisoners
into the sunlight.

310
00:47:17,541 --> 00:47:19,750
After Morgoth's defeat,

311
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:24,750
the one you call Sauron...

312
00:47:27,791 --> 00:47:31,583
Devoted himself to healing Middle-earth,

313
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:38,458
bringing its ruined lands together
in perfect order.

314
00:47:41,833 --> 00:47:43,833
He sought to craft a power

315
00:47:46,708 --> 00:47:48,375
not of the flesh...

316
00:47:50,833 --> 00:47:52,416
But over flesh.

317
00:47:53,708 --> 00:47:56,125
A power of the Unseen World.

318
00:48:00,166 --> 00:48:03,166
He bid as many as he could
to follow him far north.

319
00:48:04,916 --> 00:48:07,916
But try as he might...

320
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,416
Something was missing.

321
00:48:18,541 --> 00:48:22,041
<i>A shadow of dark knowledge</i>

322
00:48:23,125 --> 00:48:27,375
<i>that kept itself hidden, even from him.</i>

323
00:48:31,375 --> 00:48:34,958
<i>No matter how much blood
he spilt in its pursuit.</i>

324
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:42,083
Mmm. For my part...

325
00:48:44,583 --> 00:48:49,666
I sacrificed enough
of my children for his aspirations.

326
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:55,166
I split him open.

327
00:48:58,041 --> 00:49:00,291
I killed Sauron.

328
00:49:00,791 --> 00:49:02,208
I do not believe you.

329
00:49:07,083 --> 00:49:10,708
You cannot believe an <i>Uruk</i> could do that

330
00:49:12,291 --> 00:49:14,458
which your entire army could not.

331
00:49:14,875 --> 00:49:18,875
I cannot believe
that you are this army's only master.

332
00:49:18,958 --> 00:49:21,166
My children have no master.

333
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:23,541
They are not children, they are slaves.

334
00:49:23,625 --> 00:49:25,541
But each one has a name. A heart.

335
00:49:27,250 --> 00:49:28,291
A heart.

336
00:49:28,375 --> 00:49:31,583
- A heart created by Morgoth.
- We are creations of The One,

337
00:49:31,666 --> 00:49:34,416
Master of the Secret Fire,
the same as you.

338
00:49:34,958 --> 00:49:37,708
As worthy of the breath of life,

339
00:49:39,333 --> 00:49:41,083
and just as worthy of a home.

340
00:49:45,166 --> 00:49:46,250
Soon...

341
00:49:48,708 --> 00:49:51,958
This land will be ours.
Then, you will understand.

342
00:49:58,875 --> 00:49:59,875
No.

343
00:50:02,291 --> 00:50:04,125
Your kind was a mistake.

344
00:50:05,833 --> 00:50:07,250
Made in mockery.

345
00:50:09,291 --> 00:50:14,875
And even if it takes me all of this Age,
I vow to eradicate every last one of you.

346
00:50:17,458 --> 00:50:21,333
But you shall be kept alive,

347
00:50:22,250 --> 00:50:23,875
so that one day,

348
00:50:23,958 --> 00:50:26,875
before I drive my dagger
into your poisoned heart,

349
00:50:28,166 --> 00:50:31,166
I will whisper in your piked ear

350
00:50:31,250 --> 00:50:33,958
that all your offspring are dead

351
00:50:35,083 --> 00:50:38,083
and the scourge of your kind
ends with you.

352
00:50:43,041 --> 00:50:46,416
It would seem I'm not the only Elf alive

353
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:49,500
who has been transformed by darkness.

354
00:50:51,791 --> 00:50:54,291
Perhaps your search
for Morgoth's successor

355
00:50:54,375 --> 00:50:56,625
should have ended in your own mirror.

356
00:50:56,708 --> 00:51:01,416
Perhaps I shall begin by killing you,
you slavering Orc.

357
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:02,666
Galadriel.

358
00:51:08,583 --> 00:51:09,666
<i>Uruk.</i>

359
00:51:37,375 --> 00:51:38,583
Who are you?

360
00:52:18,125 --> 00:52:19,416
Thank you...

361
00:52:21,166 --> 00:52:22,583
For pulling me back.

362
00:52:25,791 --> 00:52:27,625
Was you, pulled me back first.

363
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:34,500
Whatever it was he did to you,

364
00:52:35,875 --> 00:52:37,875
and whatever it was you did...

365
00:52:41,583 --> 00:52:43,250
Be free of it.

366
00:52:46,666 --> 00:52:48,666
I never believed I could be...

367
00:52:55,083 --> 00:52:56,500
Until today.

368
00:53:01,958 --> 00:53:04,083
Fighting at your side, I...

369
00:53:06,291 --> 00:53:07,541
I felt...

370
00:53:10,250 --> 00:53:12,666
If I could just hold on to that feeling,

371
00:53:14,125 --> 00:53:16,250
keep it with me always,

372
00:53:18,041 --> 00:53:22,625
bind it to my very being, then I...

373
00:53:26,541 --> 00:53:27,958
I felt it, too.

374
00:53:40,666 --> 00:53:43,000
Lord Halbrand.

375
00:53:43,083 --> 00:53:45,083
The Queen Regent wishes to see you.

376
00:54:41,916 --> 00:54:42,875
Queen Regent.

377
00:54:48,416 --> 00:54:52,916
What I owe you...
My people are alive because of you.

378
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:56,416
As I understand it,
they're alive because of you.

379
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,083
A burden I never sought to take up.

380
00:55:01,833 --> 00:55:03,833
Few of the finest leaders do.

381
00:55:09,041 --> 00:55:12,500
But if you would like some relief
in carrying it,

382
00:55:13,708 --> 00:55:15,375
I may be able to help.

383
00:55:16,666 --> 00:55:18,666
You called for me, Your Majesty?

384
00:55:19,916 --> 00:55:21,166
Bronwyn...

385
00:55:22,583 --> 00:55:24,416
This is Lord Halbrand.

386
00:55:36,958 --> 00:55:38,125
Bronwyn.

387
00:55:40,250 --> 00:55:44,666
Is it true?
Are you the king we were promised?

388
00:55:55,666 --> 00:55:56,750
Yes.

389
00:56:02,208 --> 00:56:03,291
All hail!

390
00:56:04,375 --> 00:56:09,250
All hail to the true
King of the South lands!

391
00:56:09,333 --> 00:56:13,791
All hail
to the true King of the South lands!

392
00:56:13,875 --> 00:56:17,750
All hail to the true
King of the South lands!

393
00:56:22,916 --> 00:56:26,083
The men of these lands
have awaited this moment a long time.

394
00:56:26,875 --> 00:56:29,083
Not nearly so long as the Elves.

395
00:57:04,833 --> 00:57:06,333
Do not torment yourself.

396
00:57:11,291 --> 00:57:13,875
Many might have done the same
in your place.

397
00:57:20,708 --> 00:57:22,291
You don't understand.

398
00:57:24,958 --> 00:57:28,166
It's not just guilt I feel.

399
00:57:31,833 --> 00:57:33,250
It's loss.

400
00:57:35,916 --> 00:57:37,083
Loss?

401
00:57:42,250 --> 00:57:44,083
When it was in my hands,

402
00:57:46,375 --> 00:57:47,541
I felt...

403
00:57:51,708 --> 00:57:52,958
Powerful.

404
00:57:57,083 --> 00:57:58,833
Then rid yourself of it.

405
00:58:01,083 --> 00:58:02,583
Once and for all.

406
00:58:03,208 --> 00:58:04,375
How?

407
00:58:07,333 --> 00:58:08,666
Give it to Númenor.

408
00:58:09,708 --> 00:58:12,208
To toss into the sea on their voyage home.

409
00:59:44,708 --> 00:59:47,416
Easy. Berek, easy.

410
00:59:48,250 --> 00:59:51,041
It's just a scratch. You're okay.

411
00:59:51,125 --> 00:59:53,750
Hey, hey, hey. Berek.

412
00:59:54,625 --> 00:59:56,625
Careful.

413
00:59:58,208 --> 00:59:59,333
<i>Athae...</i>

414
01:00:02,208 --> 01:00:03,750
<i>no ídhui hí.</i>

415
01:00:08,250 --> 01:00:09,708
How did you do that?

416
01:00:09,791 --> 01:00:12,000
It's not his pain that's bothering him...

417
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:14,833
But that of his rider.

418
01:00:14,916 --> 01:00:17,875
I'm not in pain.

419
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,666
When a horse of Westernesse
rides into battle,

420
01:00:23,791 --> 01:00:27,291
he forms an unbreakable bond
with the soldier he bears.

421
01:00:28,125 --> 01:00:30,250
In time, they become as one.

422
01:00:30,333 --> 01:00:33,958
Even knowing the innermost feelings
of each other's heart.

423
01:00:34,041 --> 01:00:36,666
- You know his feelings?
- No.

424
01:00:37,625 --> 01:00:38,791
He knows yours.

425
01:00:42,291 --> 01:00:44,041
Where did you learn all this?

426
01:00:46,583 --> 01:00:48,000
From your mother.

427
01:00:57,583 --> 01:00:59,083
Think you could teach me?

428
01:01:38,125 --> 01:01:40,333
<i>Udûn...</i>

429
01:01:40,416 --> 01:01:43,625
<i>Udûn. Udûn.</i>

430
01:03:26,125 --> 01:03:27,208
Take shelter!

431
01:03:30,875 --> 01:03:31,875
The Queen!

432
01:03:36,875 --> 01:03:37,875
Berek!

433
01:03:40,750 --> 01:03:41,958
Valandil!

434
01:04:04,708 --> 01:04:05,916
Over the wall!

435
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,375
- Theo!
- Theo!﻿1
00:00:06,666 --> 00:00:09,291
Summon the legions. It is time.

2
00:00:09,666 --> 00:00:11,458
Our enemy vows to attack.

3
00:00:11,541 --> 00:00:14,541
Who among you will stand and fight?

4
00:00:14,625 --> 00:00:15,833
You will die.

5
00:00:15,916 --> 00:00:18,250
<i>Long have I awaited this day.</i>

6
00:00:18,333 --> 00:00:21,375
I pledge my loyalty to Sauron.

7
00:00:22,375 --> 00:00:23,583
Half of us just left.

8
00:00:23,666 --> 00:00:25,041
But half stayed.

9
00:00:25,333 --> 00:00:27,000
<i>Why wasn't I chosen
for the expedition?</i>

10
00:00:27,083 --> 00:00:28,666
Thought you were going west.

11
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:30,916
Not till I've done something
worthy of Númenor.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,916
<i>I have just convinced Númenor
to send five ships</i>

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,666
<i>and 500 men to aid your people</i>

14
00:00:36,791 --> 00:00:38,500
<i>and place a crown upon your head.</i>

15
00:00:38,583 --> 00:00:41,583
You are asking me to go to the one place
that I swore never to return.

16
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:43,666
Why do you keep fighting?

17
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:45,375
Because I cannot stop.

18
00:00:45,958 --> 00:00:49,250
<i>Come with me, and together we will
redeem both our bloodlines.</i>

19
00:00:50,916 --> 00:00:52,250
We head nor'-east.

20
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,041
For Middle-earth.

21
00:00:57,208 --> 00:00:59,791
<i>It is no sword. It is a power.</i>

22
00:00:59,875 --> 00:01:01,250
Have you heard of Sauron?

23
00:01:02,666 --> 00:01:03,958
<i>I've seen this before.</i>

24
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:05,500
<i>It is a key.</i>

25
00:01:06,083 --> 00:01:09,583
<i>The enemy commander spoke of
giving the Orcs a home in these lands.</i>

26
00:01:09,708 --> 00:01:11,833
<i>Whatever his design, this much is certain.</i>

27
00:01:12,333 --> 00:01:15,333
<i>Our enemy knows your son
has what he needs to enact it.</i>

28
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:17,375
<i>How long?</i>

29
00:01:18,458 --> 00:01:19,458
<i>Maybe hours.</i>

30
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:27,583
New life.

31
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:32,000
In defiance of death.

32
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:52,083
My children,

33
00:03:53,916 --> 00:03:56,625
we have endured much.

34
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:04,291
We cast off our shackles.

35
00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:09,958
Crossed mountain, field,

36
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,666
frost, and fallow

37
00:04:13,291 --> 00:04:15,250
till our feet bloodied the dirt.

38
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,666
From <i>Ered Mithrin</i> to the <i>Ephel Arnen,</i>

39
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:26,291
we have endured.

40
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:35,416
Yet tonight, one more trial awaits us.

41
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:41,583
Our enemy may be weak,
their numbers meager...

42
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:48,500
...yet before this night is through,
some of us will fall.

43
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:52,833
But for the first time, you do so

44
00:04:53,708 --> 00:04:58,083
not as unnamed slaves in far-away lands,

45
00:04:58,166 --> 00:04:59,583
but as brothers.

46
00:05:01,416 --> 00:05:04,458
As brothers and sisters in our home!

47
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:09,583
<i>Nampat.</i>

48
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:11,958
<i>Nampat! Nampat!</i>

49
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:13,416
This is the night

50
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:17,041
- we reach out the iron hand of the <i>Uruk...</i>
<i>- Nampat! Nampat!</i>

51
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:19,750
...and close our fist around these lands.

52
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:21,500
<i>Nampat!</i>

53
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:25,000
<i>Nampat!</i>

54
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:29,208
<i>Nampat!</i>

55
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:33,166
<i>Nampat!</i>

56
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:10,791
Search it.

57
00:06:11,166 --> 00:06:17,166
All of you! Fan out! Find them!

58
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,208
Meaning no offense,
Lord-father, but where is he?

59
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:06,958
What happened to Sauron?

60
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:13,875
Can't find tooth nor tail of him.
Must've got smart and scarpered.

61
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:18,250
No. The Elf's here.

62
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:20,833
I smell him.

63
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:22,000
Yes, Father.

64
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:23,750
Up here!

65
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:31,208
Bring him down!

66
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:48,500
Get out, now!

67
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:04,375
Open that door!

68
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:13,208
Get out!

69
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:18,541
Lord-father! You must move now!

70
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:20,416
You must move!

71
00:08:37,666 --> 00:08:39,916
How many of 'em
could have survived that?

72
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,458
How long do we have?

73
00:08:43,291 --> 00:08:44,500
Not long enough.

74
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:48,041
Come on,
we have to make ready the village.

75
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:36,750
Easy, Berek. Easy, boy.

76
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:50,958
Hoist it up!

77
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:06,833
I thought all soldiers
were to be abed.

78
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:08,875
Pardon me, Commander. I... I was only...

79
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:11,291
Hoping to get the first sight of land?

80
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:13,375
At ease.

81
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:17,458
It'll be visible to your eyes
in a few moments.

82
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:20,708
Is it visible to yours already?

83
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:23,750
Has been for nearly an hour.

84
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:26,833
Keen are the eyes of the Elves.

85
00:10:26,916 --> 00:10:30,166
And yet, mine have not before seen you.

86
00:10:31,125 --> 00:10:33,208
Swinging steel nor flying sail.

87
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,750
What is your rank?

88
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,416
Stable sweep.

89
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:44,916
Despise not the labor
which humbles the heart.

90
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,791
Humility has saved entire kingdoms
the proud have all but led to ruin.

91
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:52,916
I did not join this expedition
to be humbled, Commander.

92
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,750
Then for what did you join, soldier?

93
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:57,458
I was just trying to get away.

94
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:00,625
As far as I could from that place.

95
00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:01,875
Númenor?

96
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:04,458
It's not Númenor.

97
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:07,083
Not the real Númenor, anyway.

98
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:09,208
If it ever existed.

99
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:10,875
It existed.

100
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:14,083
It exists still...

101
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:16,791
If only in the heart
of the lowliest stable sweep.

102
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:19,208
It's Isildur.

103
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:21,708
I might have known.

104
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:26,041
You have the look of your father.

105
00:11:27,916 --> 00:11:30,541
I was always told I look
more like my mother.

106
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:50,708
Soldier.

107
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:55,000
Captain.

108
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:05,000
His mother...

109
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:09,791
What happened to her?

110
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,166
It is strange.

111
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:22,250
Most of my life, I've looked east
to see the Sun rise over the sea.

112
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:25,958
And west to see it set over the land.

113
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:28,541
We're sailing into the dawn,
and yet, to me,

114
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,291
it feels like the coming of night.

115
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:41,166
She drowned.

116
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:56,291
<i>Land has been sighted,
Your Majesty.</i>

117
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:58,083
<i>How long before we make anchor?</i>

118
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,416
It's a full day's sail
into the mountains.

119
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:05,958
And from there, another day's ride
east into the vale.

120
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:08,041
Signal the other ships.

121
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:10,375
Tell them to make all possible haste.

122
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,375
It is beyond our skill to destroy.

123
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:02,125
Where will you hide it?

124
00:14:05,916 --> 00:14:07,458
No one must know.

125
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:14,500
Not even you.

126
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,333
<i>Our enemy has been sighted.</i>

127
00:14:29,666 --> 00:14:31,083
<i>We survived them before.</i>

128
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:34,458
<i>Now we must do so again.</i>

129
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:40,000
Tonight.

130
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:44,250
Our position gives us an advantage.

131
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:50,500
<i>But to use it,
we must draw the enemy in close.</i>

132
00:14:53,416 --> 00:14:55,500
We must wait until every last Orc

133
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:58,083
has crossed that bridge
to spring our attack.

134
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:01,041
<i>This will test your nerve.</i>

135
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:04,958
<i>Let it.</i>

136
00:15:06,375 --> 00:15:09,875
All who cannot fight
will be barricaded inside.

137
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:13,000
This is to be our keep.
Our fallback point.

138
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:16,916
Take heart. All of you.

139
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:22,625
I have seen smaller armies
defeat greater foes.

140
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:25,416
Soon, the sun will set.

141
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:30,666
Do your part, and I swear to you,
you shall see it rise again.

142
00:15:31,875 --> 00:15:34,000
- Do you believe it?
- Aye.

143
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:37,625
- Do you believe it?
- Aye!

144
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,416
To your positions.

145
00:15:47,166 --> 00:15:48,250
What about me?

146
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:50,041
Tavern.

147
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:52,458
Tavern's for wounded and children.
I can fight.

148
00:15:52,541 --> 00:15:54,041
I know you can.

149
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:56,583
Which is why I need you in there,
protecting those who cannot.

150
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:05,750
Come.

151
00:16:11,291 --> 00:16:15,500
Remember when I was little...
When I used to have bad dreams?

152
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:17,875
I remember.

153
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:21,125
You remember what you used to say?

154
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,583
When you would hold me in the dark?

155
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:29,875
Would you say it to me now?

156
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:37,958
"In the end, this shadow
is but a small and passing thing.

157
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,916
"There is light and high beauty

158
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:47,041
"forever beyond its reach.

159
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:49,541
"Find the light...

160
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,875
"And the shadow will not find you."

161
00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:06,500
Farewell, Mother.

162
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:28,875
<i>Are you ready?</i>

163
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:33,500
No. Are you?

164
00:17:49,208 --> 00:17:50,708
The <i>alfirin</i> seeds...

165
00:17:54,666 --> 00:17:57,041
It is a tradition among Elves.

166
00:17:57,125 --> 00:18:00,541
Before the battle begins, plant one.

167
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:09,458
New life, in defiance of death?

168
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:31,875
It is believed that one of the Valar

169
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:36,708
watches over growing things...

170
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:46,791
And those who tend them.

171
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:55,791
The rest...

172
00:18:57,041 --> 00:18:59,416
we shall plant after the battle is over.

173
00:19:02,916 --> 00:19:04,333
In a new garden.

174
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:08,375
You and I.

175
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,166
And Theo.

176
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:14,875
Together.

177
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:18,875
Promise me.

178
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:09,583
They're here.

179
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:10,875
Oh, dear...

180
00:23:13,583 --> 00:23:16,333
The bleeding fools missed us.

181
00:23:46,333 --> 00:23:47,958
Come on!

182
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:51,875
They're headed for the tavern.

183
00:24:10,416 --> 00:24:13,708
- Fight for the South lands!
- Fight for the South lands!

184
00:27:21,208 --> 00:27:22,708
The land is ours!

185
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:35,666
More than a bit brave, Elf.
More than a bit.

186
00:28:19,375 --> 00:28:20,541
Bronwyn.

187
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:13,041
We were fighting our own.

188
00:29:16,541 --> 00:29:20,250
Thought we'd take 'em in
for nothin'?

189
00:29:21,291 --> 00:29:23,125
Had to pay the toll...

190
00:29:25,416 --> 00:29:29,458
And now, all of you will.

191
00:29:48,166 --> 00:29:49,000
Tredwill!

192
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:13,916
Mother!

193
00:30:16,583 --> 00:30:19,000
Everyone, to the keep!

194
00:30:21,208 --> 00:30:22,833
Go! Go!

195
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,375
Into the tavern!

196
00:30:34,375 --> 00:30:35,208
The tavern!

197
00:30:36,625 --> 00:30:38,125
All of you!

198
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:42,583
Go!

199
00:30:51,208 --> 00:30:52,541
The table!

200
00:30:52,625 --> 00:30:55,291
Hurry!

201
00:31:09,916 --> 00:31:11,333
Hurry!

202
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,583
Mother. Mother.

203
00:31:20,375 --> 00:31:22,041
Help him first.

204
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,625
No.

205
00:31:33,708 --> 00:31:35,250
We will help you.

206
00:31:36,833 --> 00:31:38,083
Mother.

207
00:31:38,166 --> 00:31:39,416
Theo...

208
00:31:41,541 --> 00:31:43,541
You'll have to stem the bleeding.

209
00:31:43,625 --> 00:31:44,833
I... I don't think I...

210
00:31:44,916 --> 00:31:48,083
Either you're gonna do this
or I'm gonna die. Do you understand?

211
00:31:50,875 --> 00:31:52,166
Theo.

212
00:32:05,125 --> 00:32:07,375
Mother, prepare yourself.

213
00:32:10,125 --> 00:32:11,250
I am sorry.

214
00:32:23,958 --> 00:32:25,583
Put pressure on the wound.

215
00:32:41,958 --> 00:32:42,791
Burn...

216
00:32:43,875 --> 00:32:46,416
She's cold.
She's lost too much blood.

217
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,083
No. No. No.

218
00:32:48,166 --> 00:32:49,666
She's saying "burn."

219
00:32:50,083 --> 00:32:53,041
The <i>alfirin</i> seeds.
We have to seal the wound with fire.

220
00:32:53,625 --> 00:32:55,708
Bring me some burning wood. Hurry!

221
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:05,958
Now.

222
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:11,125
Now.

223
00:33:16,791 --> 00:33:17,958
Now this side.

224
00:33:23,125 --> 00:33:24,208
Go on.

225
00:33:30,541 --> 00:33:31,541
That's enough.

226
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:46,500
Bronwyn?

227
00:33:47,916 --> 00:33:49,666
- Mother?
- Bronwyn?

228
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:51,958
Wake up! Mother!

229
00:34:25,291 --> 00:34:27,166
<i>Nampat!</i>

230
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:30,083
<i>Nampat!</i>

231
00:34:30,166 --> 00:34:31,250
<i>Nampat!</i>

232
00:34:32,916 --> 00:34:34,000
<i>Nampat!</i>

233
00:34:35,458 --> 00:34:36,541
<i>Nampat!</i>

234
00:34:37,958 --> 00:34:39,291
<i>Nampat!</i>

235
00:34:40,375 --> 00:34:41,458
<i>Nampat!</i>

236
00:34:42,166 --> 00:34:44,166
<i>- Kick 'em in the back!
- Nampat!</i>

237
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:46,625
<i>Nampat!</i>

238
00:34:48,166 --> 00:34:49,166
<i>Nampat!</i>

239
00:34:50,833 --> 00:34:51,875
<i>Nampat!</i>

240
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:54,208
Sit down!

241
00:36:31,416 --> 00:36:34,083
What I seek.

242
00:36:34,166 --> 00:36:35,833
Give it to me.

243
00:36:37,166 --> 00:36:38,583
Let them go.

244
00:36:41,541 --> 00:36:42,875
I will consider it.

245
00:36:55,583 --> 00:37:00,125
Why sacrifice
their lives for such a little thing?

246
00:37:21,416 --> 00:37:22,833
The woman next.

247
00:37:24,291 --> 00:37:25,375
No!

248
00:37:31,041 --> 00:37:32,208
- Wait!
- Theo!

249
00:37:34,333 --> 00:37:35,375
It's under here.

250
00:37:37,583 --> 00:37:39,166
It's under here.

251
00:37:43,375 --> 00:37:44,541
No.

252
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:56,500
Theo!

253
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,083
I'm sorry.

254
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,875
Waldreg, I have a task for you.

255
00:38:59,625 --> 00:39:01,875
They all must die.

256
00:40:18,458 --> 00:40:19,500
Ontamo!

257
00:40:48,458 --> 00:40:49,375
Go.

258
00:40:50,416 --> 00:40:51,416
Hyah!

259
00:41:01,875 --> 00:41:02,916
Hyah!

260
00:41:17,208 --> 00:41:18,458
Father!

261
00:41:28,541 --> 00:41:30,041
Father!

262
00:41:30,125 --> 00:41:32,166
- I'm all right.
- I thought you...

263
00:41:33,250 --> 00:41:34,666
I'm all right, Isil.

264
00:41:40,583 --> 00:41:42,166
Soldier.

265
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:43,250
Their commander?

266
00:41:47,625 --> 00:41:49,041
The item he possesses...

267
00:41:49,125 --> 00:41:50,875
He must not escape with it.

268
00:42:00,583 --> 00:42:01,750
Who is that?

269
00:42:05,416 --> 00:42:07,041
Commander
of the Northern Armies.

270
00:42:07,416 --> 00:42:09,375
Galadriel.

271
00:42:48,291 --> 00:42:50,875
<i>Noro lim!</i>

272
00:43:19,875 --> 00:43:20,958
Go!

273
00:44:00,333 --> 00:44:01,750
You remember me?

274
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:09,500
No.

275
00:44:23,458 --> 00:44:24,500
Stop!

276
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,333
We need him alive.

277
00:44:27,875 --> 00:44:29,500
I need him alive.

278
00:44:30,666 --> 00:44:32,291
You don't know what he did.

279
00:44:35,583 --> 00:44:41,458
Did I cause someone you love pain?

280
00:44:45,541 --> 00:44:46,791
A woman?

281
00:44:50,041 --> 00:44:54,250
Perhaps a child?

282
00:44:54,333 --> 00:44:55,916
Eat your tongue.

283
00:44:58,333 --> 00:45:01,333
Halbrand, put it down.

284
00:45:06,166 --> 00:45:09,166
One cannot satisfy thirst
by drinking sea water.

285
00:45:27,708 --> 00:45:29,041
So, what do you think?

286
00:45:33,375 --> 00:45:34,625
I like the mountains.

287
00:45:36,083 --> 00:45:38,583
You're about to get a closer look at them.

288
00:45:39,541 --> 00:45:41,958
Commander Galadriel's
putting together a company

289
00:45:42,041 --> 00:45:44,041
to track down the Orcs that escaped,

290
00:45:44,125 --> 00:45:46,666
and I managed to wheedle
the pair of us a spot.

291
00:45:46,750 --> 00:45:47,875
What about Ontamo?

292
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,458
I think I might stay here for a while.
Lend these folk a hand.

293
00:45:51,541 --> 00:45:55,416
- Seen enough battle for a week?
- More like a whole lifetime.

294
00:45:59,250 --> 00:46:01,833
This company, when's it set out?

295
00:46:02,708 --> 00:46:05,708
Don't know for certain.
Not till she's done with him.

296
00:46:10,541 --> 00:46:15,541
When I was a child, I heard stories
of Elves taken by Morgoth.

297
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,833
Tortured. Twisted.

298
00:46:21,875 --> 00:46:24,541
Made into a new and ruined form of life.

299
00:46:26,583 --> 00:46:29,000
You are one of them, are you not?

300
00:46:30,750 --> 00:46:32,333
The Moriondor.

301
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,583
The Sons of the Dark.

302
00:46:36,833 --> 00:46:38,875
The first Orcs.

303
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:40,708
<i>Uruk.</i>

304
00:46:45,041 --> 00:46:46,458
We prefer <i>"Uruk."</i>

305
00:46:46,541 --> 00:46:50,000
Even Moriondor take orders from a master.

306
00:46:50,083 --> 00:46:51,875
And I seek yours.

307
00:46:52,625 --> 00:46:53,708
Where is he?

308
00:46:54,916 --> 00:46:56,250
Where is Sauron?

309
00:47:06,083 --> 00:47:09,041
Perhaps we should bring our prisoners
into the sunlight.

310
00:47:17,541 --> 00:47:19,750
After Morgoth's defeat,

311
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:24,750
the one you call Sauron...

312
00:47:27,791 --> 00:47:31,583
Devoted himself to healing Middle-earth,

313
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:38,458
bringing its ruined lands together
in perfect order.

314
00:47:41,833 --> 00:47:43,833
He sought to craft a power

315
00:47:46,708 --> 00:47:48,375
not of the flesh...

316
00:47:50,833 --> 00:47:52,416
But over flesh.

317
00:47:53,708 --> 00:47:56,125
A power of the Unseen World.

318
00:48:00,166 --> 00:48:03,166
He bid as many as he could
to follow him far north.

319
00:48:04,916 --> 00:48:07,916
But try as he might...

320
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,416
Something was missing.

321
00:48:18,541 --> 00:48:22,041
<i>A shadow of dark knowledge</i>

322
00:48:23,125 --> 00:48:27,375
<i>that kept itself hidden, even from him.</i>

323
00:48:31,375 --> 00:48:34,958
<i>No matter how much blood
he spilt in its pursuit.</i>

324
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:42,083
Mmm. For my part...

325
00:48:44,583 --> 00:48:49,666
I sacrificed enough
of my children for his aspirations.

326
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:55,166
I split him open.

327
00:48:58,041 --> 00:49:00,291
I killed Sauron.

328
00:49:00,791 --> 00:49:02,208
I do not believe you.

329
00:49:07,083 --> 00:49:10,708
You cannot believe an <i>Uruk</i> could do that

330
00:49:12,291 --> 00:49:14,458
which your entire army could not.

331
00:49:14,875 --> 00:49:18,875
I cannot believe
that you are this army's only master.

332
00:49:18,958 --> 00:49:21,166
My children have no master.

333
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:23,541
They are not children, they are slaves.

334
00:49:23,625 --> 00:49:25,541
But each one has a name. A heart.

335
00:49:27,250 --> 00:49:28,291
A heart.

336
00:49:28,375 --> 00:49:31,583
- A heart created by Morgoth.
- We are creations of The One,

337
00:49:31,666 --> 00:49:34,416
Master of the Secret Fire,
the same as you.

338
00:49:34,958 --> 00:49:37,708
As worthy of the breath of life,

339
00:49:39,333 --> 00:49:41,083
and just as worthy of a home.

340
00:49:45,166 --> 00:49:46,250
Soon...

341
00:49:48,708 --> 00:49:51,958
This land will be ours.
Then, you will understand.

342
00:49:58,875 --> 00:49:59,875
No.

343
00:50:02,291 --> 00:50:04,125
Your kind was a mistake.

344
00:50:05,833 --> 00:50:07,250
Made in mockery.

345
00:50:09,291 --> 00:50:14,875
And even if it takes me all of this Age,
I vow to eradicate every last one of you.

346
00:50:17,458 --> 00:50:21,333
But you shall be kept alive,

347
00:50:22,250 --> 00:50:23,875
so that one day,

348
00:50:23,958 --> 00:50:26,875
before I drive my dagger
into your poisoned heart,

349
00:50:28,166 --> 00:50:31,166
I will whisper in your piked ear

350
00:50:31,250 --> 00:50:33,958
that all your offspring are dead

351
00:50:35,083 --> 00:50:38,083
and the scourge of your kind
ends with you.

352
00:50:43,041 --> 00:50:46,416
It would seem I'm not the only Elf alive

353
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:49,500
who has been transformed by darkness.

354
00:50:51,791 --> 00:50:54,291
Perhaps your search
for Morgoth's successor

355
00:50:54,375 --> 00:50:56,625
should have ended in your own mirror.

356
00:50:56,708 --> 00:51:01,416
Perhaps I shall begin by killing you,
you slavering Orc.

357
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:02,666
Galadriel.

358
00:51:08,583 --> 00:51:09,666
<i>Uruk.</i>

359
00:51:37,375 --> 00:51:38,583
Who are you?

360
00:52:18,125 --> 00:52:19,416
Thank you...

361
00:52:21,166 --> 00:52:22,583
For pulling me back.

362
00:52:25,791 --> 00:52:27,625
Was you, pulled me back first.

363
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:34,500
Whatever it was he did to you,

364
00:52:35,875 --> 00:52:37,875
and whatever it was you did...

365
00:52:41,583 --> 00:52:43,250
Be free of it.

366
00:52:46,666 --> 00:52:48,666
I never believed I could be...

367
00:52:55,083 --> 00:52:56,500
Until today.

368
00:53:01,958 --> 00:53:04,083
Fighting at your side, I...

369
00:53:06,291 --> 00:53:07,541
I felt...

370
00:53:10,250 --> 00:53:12,666
If I could just hold on to that feeling,

371
00:53:14,125 --> 00:53:16,250
keep it with me always,

372
00:53:18,041 --> 00:53:22,625
bind it to my very being, then I...

373
00:53:26,541 --> 00:53:27,958
I felt it, too.

374
00:53:40,666 --> 00:53:43,000
Lord Halbrand.

375
00:53:43,083 --> 00:53:45,083
The Queen Regent wishes to see you.

376
00:54:41,916 --> 00:54:42,875
Queen Regent.

377
00:54:48,416 --> 00:54:52,916
What I owe you...
My people are alive because of you.

378
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:56,416
As I understand it,
they're alive because of you.

379
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,083
A burden I never sought to take up.

380
00:55:01,833 --> 00:55:03,833
Few of the finest leaders do.

381
00:55:09,041 --> 00:55:12,500
But if you would like some relief
in carrying it,

382
00:55:13,708 --> 00:55:15,375
I may be able to help.

383
00:55:16,666 --> 00:55:18,666
You called for me, Your Majesty?

384
00:55:19,916 --> 00:55:21,166
Bronwyn...

385
00:55:22,583 --> 00:55:24,416
This is Lord Halbrand.

386
00:55:36,958 --> 00:55:38,125
Bronwyn.

387
00:55:40,250 --> 00:55:44,666
Is it true?
Are you the king we were promised?

388
00:55:55,666 --> 00:55:56,750
Yes.

389
00:56:02,208 --> 00:56:03,291
All hail!

390
00:56:04,375 --> 00:56:09,250
All hail to the true
King of the South lands!

391
00:56:09,333 --> 00:56:13,791
All hail
to the true King of the South lands!

392
00:56:13,875 --> 00:56:17,750
All hail to the true
King of the South lands!

393
00:56:22,916 --> 00:56:26,083
The men of these lands
have awaited this moment a long time.

394
00:56:26,875 --> 00:56:29,083
Not nearly so long as the Elves.

395
00:57:04,833 --> 00:57:06,333
Do not torment yourself.

396
00:57:11,291 --> 00:57:13,875
Many might have done the same
in your place.

397
00:57:20,708 --> 00:57:22,291
You don't understand.

398
00:57:24,958 --> 00:57:28,166
It's not just guilt I feel.

399
00:57:31,833 --> 00:57:33,250
It's loss.

400
00:57:35,916 --> 00:57:37,083
Loss?

401
00:57:42,250 --> 00:57:44,083
When it was in my hands,

402
00:57:46,375 --> 00:57:47,541
I felt...

403
00:57:51,708 --> 00:57:52,958
Powerful.

404
00:57:57,083 --> 00:57:58,833
Then rid yourself of it.

405
00:58:01,083 --> 00:58:02,583
Once and for all.

406
00:58:03,208 --> 00:58:04,375
How?

407
00:58:07,333 --> 00:58:08,666
Give it to Númenor.

408
00:58:09,708 --> 00:58:12,208
To toss into the sea on their voyage home.

409
00:59:44,708 --> 00:59:47,416
Easy. Berek, easy.

410
00:59:48,250 --> 00:59:51,041
It's just a scratch. You're okay.

411
00:59:51,125 --> 00:59:53,750
Hey, hey, hey. Berek.

412
00:59:54,625 --> 00:59:56,625
Careful.

413
00:59:58,208 --> 00:59:59,333
<i>Athae...</i>

414
01:00:02,208 --> 01:00:03,750
<i>no ídhui hí.</i>

415
01:00:08,250 --> 01:00:09,708
How did you do that?

416
01:00:09,791 --> 01:00:12,000
It's not his pain that's bothering him...

417
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:14,833
But that of his rider.

418
01:00:14,916 --> 01:00:17,875
I'm not in pain.

419
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,666
When a horse of Westernesse
rides into battle,

420
01:00:23,791 --> 01:00:27,291
he forms an unbreakable bond
with the soldier he bears.

421
01:00:28,125 --> 01:00:30,250
In time, they become as one.

422
01:00:30,333 --> 01:00:33,958
Even knowing the innermost feelings
of each other's heart.

423
01:00:34,041 --> 01:00:36,666
- You know his feelings?
- No.

424
01:00:37,625 --> 01:00:38,791
He knows yours.

425
01:00:42,291 --> 01:00:44,041
Where did you learn all this?

426
01:00:46,583 --> 01:00:48,000
From your mother.

427
01:00:57,583 --> 01:00:59,083
Think you could teach me?

428
01:01:38,125 --> 01:01:40,333
<i>Udûn...</i>

429
01:01:40,416 --> 01:01:43,625
<i>Udûn. Udûn.</i>

430
01:03:26,125 --> 01:03:27,208
Take shelter!

431
01:03:30,875 --> 01:03:31,875
The Queen!

432
01:03:36,875 --> 01:03:37,875
Berek!

433
01:03:40,750 --> 01:03:41,958
Valandil!

434
01:04:04,708 --> 01:04:05,916
Over the wall!

435
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,375
- Theo!
- Theo!
