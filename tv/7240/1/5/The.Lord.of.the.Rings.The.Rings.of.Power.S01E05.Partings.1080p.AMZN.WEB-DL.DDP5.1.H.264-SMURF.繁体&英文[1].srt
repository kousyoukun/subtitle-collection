1
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:08,080
你得發誓
I need your oath.

2
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:11,750
新礦石的第一絲蹤跡
The first traces of a new ore.

3
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:15,160
埃爾隆德保證 吉爾加拉德派他來這里并沒有惡意
Elrond has been very convincing in his assurances

4
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:18,120
埃爾隆德的話讓人非常信服
that Gil-galad bore no ill intent when he sent him here.

5
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,870
感覺事有蹊蹺
There is something more at work.

6
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:20,870
去林頓吧
Go to Lindon.

7
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:21,790
看看是怎么回事
Find out what.

8
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:25,660
你被踢出海上衛隊了  你們仨全部淘汰 
You're off the Sea Guard! All three of you!

9
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:26,580
夠了 
Enough!

10
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:29,830
我毀了朋友們的生活 羞辱了家門
I just ruined my friends' lives, shamed our family name.

11
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,160
你去找那些在舊瞭望塔避難的人
Go to the Men who have taken refuge in the old watchtower.

12
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:35,870
給他們捎個口信
Deliver to them a message.

13
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:39,580
你的人民要想保全性命 必須放棄這些土地的所有權
That your people may live if you forsake all claim to these lands

14
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:41,080
并向他宣誓效忠
and swear fealty to him.

15
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,910
總有一天 我們真正的國王會歸來
One day, our true king will return.

16
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:47,500
我相信你關在地牢里的那一位
I believe the man you hold in your dungeons

17
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:51,450
是流亡在外 下落不明的南方大地王位繼承人
is the lost heir in exile to the throne of the Southlands.

18
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:53,500
我請求您與我并肩作戰
I call on you to fight with me...

19
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:55,080
-我愿意出征  -我愿意出征 
-I will serve! -I will serve!

20
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,660
避免索隆將他們的土地據為己有
...before Sauron claims their lands for his own.

21
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,080
你撒謊
You have lied,

22
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,620
還把危險的外族人帶了進來
brought a dangerous outsider into our midst.

23
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:10,000
我們要掉隊了
We're going to be left behind.

24
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,040
這就是我們大家不會掉隊的原因
This is how we keep up with the others.

25
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,410
因為他會幫我們 我們也會幫他
He helps us, and... and we help him.

26
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:35,450
指環王：力量之戒
第一季第五集

27
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:35,450
本WEB版外掛字幕由  風吹來的那片云  雙語合并

28
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:04,330
“千禧”
My great thumb. My great thumb.

29
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:06,250
不對 應該念遷…遷徙
No. Mi... Migration.

30
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:08,830
遷-徙
Like, mi-gra-tion.

31
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:14,040
意思就是搬家 我們毛腳族搬家就叫做遷徙
Means, like, to move. What we do, Harfoots.

32
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:17,120
是這樣 我們會去老林子過冬
You see, we... we winter in Old Forest,

33
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,200
仲夏時節 我們會 趁蝸牛鮮美時前往諾菲德山谷捕食
and mid-summer, we make for Norfield Glen to snail while the snailing's good.

34
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:23,250
-“蝸牛”  -沒錯 蝸牛
-"Snails, snails"? -Snails, yeah.

35
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:26,910
在橡樹葉剛剛開始變紅的秋天 我們前往格羅夫果園
And at the first blush of the oak leaves, we head to the Grove.

36
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,620
整個果園
A whole orchard,

37
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:33,700
到處都是蘋果 李子 杏子 胡蘿卜 你肯定很喜歡
popping with bar apples, plums, apricots, carrots, you'll... you'll love it.

38
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:41,040
當然了 唯一的麻煩是 從一地遷徙到另一地要歷經重重危險
Of course, the only trouble is there's a hundred perils between here and there.

39
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:44,750
“危險” 
"Perils"?

40
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:46,950
就是威脅
Like a danger.

41
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,200
比如人類 狼群 霧 雨
You know, big folk, wolves, fog, rain,

42
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:55,750
山嶺食人妖 洞穴食人妖 只要能殺死你的都算是威脅
hill-trolls, cave-trolls, anything that'll kill ya.

43
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:58,830
“殺死” 
"Kill"?

44
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:02,950
意思就是把某個東西弄死掉
Means to make somethin' dead.

45
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,950
那我就是個危險
I'm peril.

46
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,750
不 你不是的
No. No, no, you're not.

47
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:24,000
-更像是說… -不 螢火蟲
-It's more... -No. Fireflies.

48
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:26,700
那是一次意外 就是…
-That was just an accident. It's...

49
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:29,330
你不是危險
You're not a peril.

50
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:31,540
你很好
You're good.

51
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,120
我很好 
I'm good?

52
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:40,200
你很好 因為你是來幫忙的
You're good. Because you're here to help.

53
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:45,830
諾瑞 
Nori!

54
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:48,330
好了 其他人現在應該準備好了
Oh, great. Others should be ready by now.

55
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:50,950
小腿跑起來 
Quick sticks!

56
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:54,540
我們走 來啊
Let's go. Come on.

57
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,450
我…
I... I'm...

58
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:01,790
我很好
I'm good.

59
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:06,540
你再敢用那根拐杖戳我
Poke me with that crutch again,

60
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:09,040
我就趁你睡覺的時候 拔掉你腳趾上的毛發
I'll pluck the hair off your toes in your sleep.

61
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,330
那你拔毛的時候 順便把我的耳朵也揪掉吧
And I'll pluck off my ears while you're at it.

62
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:13,370
省得我再聽你的鼾聲
It'd save me listenin' to your snorin'.

63
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:14,790
閉嘴吧 我才不打呼嚕呢
Oh, stuff. I do not snore.

64
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:16,450
-你確實打呼嚕 -你確實打呼嚕
-Yes, you do.

65
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:21,000
快走吧 動起來 不邁腿永遠都去不了格羅夫
Come on, now. Grove's not gonna migrate to us.

66
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:25,080
你要是給我們唱你媽媽的趕路歌 沒準能幫我們走快點
Might help us move faster if you sang us your mam's walking song.

67
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,700
是啊 唱吧 波比 喊兩嗓子
Yeah, go on, Pops, give us a warble.

68
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:29,870
唱吧 能給我們趕路加油鼓勁
Oh, come on, it'll do us some good.

69
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:36,370
太陽正在落下
-The sun is fast fallin'

70
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:39,160
落在森巖的樹林后方
Beneath trees of stone

71
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:42,910
塔中之光
The light in the tower

72
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,040
不再是家鄉
No longer my home

73
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:49,410
過去燈火朦朧
Past eyes of pale fire

74
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,660
黑沙做我的睡床
Black sand for my bed

75
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,910
我用所知的一切
I trade all I've known

76
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,910
換取未知的未來
For the unknown ahead

77
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,620
呼喚我 遙遠之地 請呼喚我
Call to me Call to me lands far away

78
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,830
羅瓦尼安之丘-韋德布魯克

79
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:08,370
因為我現在 必須在這流浪的日子里游蕩
For I must now wander this wandering day

80
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:10,950
副崖-灰色沼澤

81
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:14,620
我必須游蕩
Away I must wander

82
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:17,330
在這流浪的日子里
This wandering day

83
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,830
我缺水
Of drink I have little

84
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:25,120
我少食
And food I have less

85
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:30,080
我的力量告訴我不行 但是這條路要求我踏足
My strength tells me no But the path demands yes

86
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,410
鮭鱒彎

87
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:36,910
我雙腿很短 而道阻且長
My legs are so short And the way is so long

88
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,790
無法休息 何談舒適
I've no rest nor comfort

89
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:43,330
無所慰藉 唯有歌聲
No comfort, but song

90
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:45,790
西斯爾戴爾-辮子

91
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:50,910
為我歌唱 遙遠之地 請為我歌唱
Sing to me, sing to me Lands far away

92
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,870
請起身指引我度過這流浪的日子
Oh, rise up and guide me This wandering day

93
00:06:56,950 --> 00:07:00,160
請答應要找到我
Please promise to find me

94
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:03,830
在這個流浪的日子
-This wandering day

95
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:08,040
最終 他們的答案來了
-At last comes their answer

96
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:11,080
穿過寒冷和霜凍
Through cold and through frost

97
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:17,160
并非所有的流浪者都身陷迷途
That not all who wonder or wander are lost

98
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:20,160
不論悲傷
No matter the sorrow

99
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:23,290
不計成本
No matter the cost

100
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:29,370
并非所有的流浪者都身陷迷途
That not all who wonder Or wander are... Lost

101
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:40,200
隧道挖通了 大人
The tunnel is complete, my lord.

102
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:48,200
給我看看你的手臂
Your arm. Show it to me.

103
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:58,910
感覺怎么樣 
How does it feel?

104
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,330
像被火烤一樣疼 父親大人
Like fire, Lord-father.

105
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:07,000
我真希望你能像我一樣感受陽光
I wish you could feel it like I do.

106
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:11,000
因為太陽很快就要消失了
For soon, it will be gone.

107
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:17,910
我身體里能感受到溫暖的那部分 也將隨之消失
And with it, the part of me that knew its warmth as well.

108
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:23,120
我會想念它的
I shall miss it.

109
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:29,580
是時候了 去召集軍團吧
Summon the legions. It is time.

110
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,700
我們的敵人揚言要發起進攻
-Our enemy vows to attack.

111
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:07,790
要想活命
In exchange for mercy,

112
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:10,580
敵人命令我們放棄這座瞭望塔
we've been ordered to abandon this tower

113
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:12,830
并向他們的指揮官宣誓效忠
and swear fealty to their commander.

114
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:17,870
我明白我不是 你們翹首以盼的那個國王
I know I'm not the king you have awaited.

115
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:20,950
但如果你們選擇和我并肩戰斗
But if you choose to stand with me and fight,

116
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,450
那這座瞭望塔 將不再會是我們脆弱的招牌
this tower will no longer be a reminder of our frailty,

117
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,790
而將會變成我們力量的象征
but a symbol of our strength.

118
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,620
有誰愿意和我并肩作戰 
Who will stand with me?

119
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:36,660
你們當中有誰愿意奮起作戰 
Who among you will stand and fight?

120
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:47,200
-好的 我們戰斗吧 -好的
-Aye, let's do it. -Aye.

121
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:49,910
奮起作戰 
Stand and fight?

122
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:54,160
奮起作戰 
Stand and fight?

123
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:56,120
你們會死的
You will die.

124
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:01,000
要我說 我們最好碰碰運氣
I say it'd be better to take our chances

125
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:04,000
臣服于所謂的敵人
bowing to the supposed enemy.

126
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,250
我直視過敵人的眼睛
I have looked that enemy in the eye.

127
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:08,750
他拯救不了你
He's not your deliverance.

128
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:10,540
那你覺得你能 
You think you are?

129
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:12,790
指望精靈 
Elf?

130
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,450
我要替祖先說句話
I'll say this for our ancestors.

131
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,500
敵人并沒有殺他們啊 
They lived!

132
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:26,120
只要團結一致 我們就能活下來
Together, we can survive this.

133
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,040
如果跟我走 我們必定會活下來 
Follow me, and together, we will!

134
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:35,910
來吧 都跟我走 來吧 
Come on. Let's go. Come on. Follow me. Come on!

135
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,000
來吧 
-Come on!

136
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:39,910
跟我走 
Follow me!

137
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,250
希奧 
Theo!

138
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:49,250
這是我們的好機會 好時機 快來
It's our chance. It's our time. Come on.

139
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:52,370
跟我一起走 來吧 小伙子 跟我來
With me. Come on, lad. Follow me, lad.

140
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:07,580
能幫我一把嗎 
Right. Okay. Give me a hand, will ya?

141
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,160
再高點…
Higher. Higher!

142
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:18,330
小伙子們 這一輪足夠了
-Enough for that run, lads.

143
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:24,660
現在往外運吧
Ferry it out now.

144
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,160
-父親 -伊熙爾杜
-Father. -Isildur.

145
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:34,580
我們能聊聊嗎 
May we speak?

146
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:39,620
為什么沒有選我進遠征軍 
Why wasn't I chosen for the expedition?

147
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:42,330
-我以為你要去西部 -不去了
-Thought you were going west. -Not anymore.

148
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:45,250
我要先做點 配得上努門諾爾人做的事
Not till I've done something worthy of Númenor.

149
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:48,790
那是什么事呢 用你自己的話來說
And what is that? In your words.

150
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,080
我描述不出來
I don't have words for it.

151
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,910
所以我才非常努力地尋找
That's why I'm trying so hard to find it.

152
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:57,120
所以我才來尋求您的幫助
Why I'm asking for your help.

153
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,620
我倒是希望能幫你
Wish I could provide it.

154
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:03,700
但志愿者的數量 遠遠超出了我們能容納的范圍
But we've far more volunteers than we could ever hope to accommodate.

155
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:06,290
這城市有一半的人想要登上那些船
Half the city wants a spot on those boats.

156
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:10,950
把我塞進隊列的前排
Slip me to the front of the line.

157
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:15,750
你有什么資格 
What are your qualifications?

158
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:18,330
-“資格”  -你隸屬于海上衛隊嗎 
-"Qualifications"? -Do you belong to the Sea Guard?

159
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:22,580
-你明知道我比水手厲害得多… -你隸屬于海上衛隊嗎 
-You know I'm twice the sailor... -Do you belong to the Sea Guard?

160
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:24,410
女王衛隊呢 商人公會呢 
What about the Queen's Guard? Merchant's Guild?

161
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,660
-看來有正式編制才是重點 -騎士公會呢 
-This is about uniform. -Horseman's Guild?

162
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:27,750
你太扯了
You're being absurd.

163
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:30,750
你還在假裝 忠于這座島上的傳統的時候
While you were feigning fidelity to the traditions of this isle,

164
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:33,870
這些人已經在將傳統發揚光大了
these men were living them.

165
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:38,120
他們想盡辦法貢獻力量 志愿出征
Finding ways to contribute. To serve.

166
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:42,120
這些東西顯然你并不在乎
Something of which you evidently care little.

167
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:47,540
我在乎 而且我準備好出征了
I care. I'm ready to serve.

168
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:50,750
只有這件事能讓我感到自豪
Nothing would make me prouder.

169
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:53,290
但是你錯失了良機
But you had your chance.

170
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:56,750
而且你已經做出了選擇
And you made your choice.

171
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,750
讓努門諾爾人冒著生命之險
-Risk Númenorean lives

172
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:07,870
就為了一些骯臟的中洲南方人 和一個好戰的精靈 
for some grimy Southlander and a warmongering Elf?

173
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:11,660
法拉宗國師  你為什么要讓我們的親人去送死 
Consul Pharaz?n! Why are you sending our kinsmen off to die?

174
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:14,660
法拉宗
-Pharaz?n! Pharaz?n!

175
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:18,950
-法拉宗  -跟我來
-Pharaz?n! -Come with me.

176
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,830
請原諒我沒發消息 這周太難熬了
Forgive me for not sending word to you sooner. Been a trying week.

177
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:23,330
他為什么不阻止這一切 
Why didn't he stop this?

178
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:26,120
-他忠于女王 不論對… -肯定是錯
-He's loyal to her. Rightly or... -Wrongly.

179
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:29,790
很多人和你感覺一樣 但這還不足以改變他的想法 但是…
There are many who feel as you do. Not enough to sway him yet, but

180
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:33,000
只有你可以去說服他 他會聽你的
given the right push... Then it must be you. He will listen to you.

181
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:37,500
我一開口說話 他就閉耳塞聽
When I speak, his ears close up.

182
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:43,620
那你就大點聲說
So speak louder.

183
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:27,040
中洲南方人
Oi, Southlander.

184
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:29,370
有人找你
You have visitors.

185
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:42,330
敵人接下來去哪里了 
And where did the enemy head next?

186
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:46,120
我認為敵人繼續往南 朝著歐斯提力斯瞭望塔進軍
Further south, I should think. Towards the watchtower of Ostirith.

187
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,830
我去通知海上衛隊
I'll inform the Sea Guard.

188
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:57,700
非常感謝 哈爾布蘭德大人
My thanks, Lord Halbrand.

189
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:02,450
我敢肯定 等我們登陸后 你的民眾一定會發揮重要作用
I'm certain your fellowship will prove just as invaluable once we make landfall.

190
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,330
登陸 
"Landfall?"

191
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:08,790
加拉德瑞爾告知我們 你希望團結你的人民
Galadriel informed us of your aspiration to unite your people.

192
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,250
她居然這樣說
Did she now?

193
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:14,250
我相信她絕非未加思考脫口而出
I trust she was not speaking in haste?

194
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,950
其實 我的本意是…
As a matter of fact, it was my intention...

195
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,500
我的同伴只是覺得肩上的任務很重
My companion is merely feeling the weight of his task.

196
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:24,950
但我毫不懷疑 到時候 他會盡自己的一份力量
I have no doubt, come time, he will do his part.

197
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:30,580
我已經為本次任務背書 希望他能如你所說
Given that I've staked my name upon it, I should hope so.

198
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:35,620
攝政女王 您父親請您去一趟塔里
Queen Regent, your father has requested your presence in the tower.

199
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:46,410
“加拉德瑞爾告知我們”
"Galadriel informed us."

200
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:50,040
怪不得當時 女王居然知道要去她父親床邊堵截我
I wondered how the queen knew to waylay me at her father's bedside.

201
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:53,080
沒曾想到你為了公會徽章背叛了我
It never occurred to me you'd hand me over for a guild crest.

202
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:56,290
我之前懇求你放過我 但你卻利用了我
You used me. After I all but begged you to let me be.

203
00:16:56,370 --> 00:17:00,450
我剛剛說服努門諾爾派出五艘船
I have just convinced Númenor to send five ships

204
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:03,370
和五百人來幫助你的人民
and 500 men to aid your people

205
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:05,950
幫你加冕為王
and place a crown upon your head.

206
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,330
很多人可能會認為是你利用了我
Many might assume you used me.

207
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:19,080
麻煩另找別人去加冕吧
Find another head to crown.

208
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,370
我不喜歡這里
I don't like it here.

209
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:36,120
沒事的 迪莉 只是樹而已
Oh, it's okay, Dil. It's just the trees.

210
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:39,080
他們選這條路是失心瘋了嗎 
What madness made them go this way?

211
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,830
石頭足路就應該被封起來
Rockfoot Pass must be blocked in.

212
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:47,330
天黑路難行 繼續前進
Won't get any easier in the dark. Keep movin'.

213
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:53,160
“天黑路難行”
"Easier in the dark."

214
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,330
是狼群
Wolves.

215
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:19,000
你為什么不告訴我到底發生了什么 
Why don't you tell me what's really goin' on?

216
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:23,620
每年的這個時節 這些樹林從沒有這樣光禿禿過
These woods have never been this bare this time of year.

217
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,410
原因太顯而易見了
It's as plain as lip fungus.

218
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:28,000
都怪他 不是嗎 那個大家伙
He is responsible, isn't he? The big fella.

219
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,080
你希望我怎么做 
What precisely do you expect me to do about it?

220
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,290
做你當初在營地就該做的事
What you ought to have done at the camp.

221
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:34,750
卸掉他們的推車輪子 丟下他們 
-Take their wheels and leave them!

222
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,750
到底要怎么樣你才肯做 
What's it gonna take?

223
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:40,000
非得有人變成寡婦 
Make a widow of somebody?

224
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,500
或者孤兒嗎 
Or an orphan?

225
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,790
大家都餓了
People are gettin' hungry.

226
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:53,000
跟緊了
Stay close.

227
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:05,410
這很奇怪…
Oh, this is very strange. Most peculiar.

228
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:09,660
非常奇怪…
Most peculiar.

229
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,370
-你們差點嚇死我了 -瑪爾娃
-You nearly caused my heart to burst. -Malva.

230
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,080
-我們看到腳印了 -在泥里
-We saw footprints. -In the mud.

231
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,120
請你們一個一個說 
-Lots of 'em! -One at a time, please!

232
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:39,410
快跑 
-Run!

233
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:44,620
快點 快跑 
-Come on! Run!

234
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,290
諾瑞 
Nori!

235
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,700
諾瑞 
Nori! Nori!

236
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:12,450
諾瑞 快躲開 
Nori, get away from there!

237
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:16,540
諾瑞 
-Nori! Nori!

238
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:17,620
不要 它會咬到你的 
No! It'll get you!

239
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,410
堅守陣地 安塔摩
Hold your ground, Ontamo.

240
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:16,450
讓你的父親感到驕傲
Make your father proud.

241
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,330
他們的擊打動作 像北荒原的巖石巨人一樣笨拙
Their strokes fall like the Stone-giants of the North Moors.

242
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:22,160
但是 
And yet?

243
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:28,620
他們沒有對付這個敵人的經驗
They are untested against this foe.

244
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:33,950
或許精靈愿意提供一些指導 
Perhaps the Elf would be willing to offer some instructions?

245
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:44,500
殺死奧克的方法有很多種
There are many ways to kill an Orc.

246
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:48,120
但對你們而言 我建議用簡潔有力的方法
But for you, I will keep it strong and simple.

247
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:51,450
猛刺 旋扭 拔出
Stab, twist, gut.

248
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,410
跟我比劃一下
Come at me.

249
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,620
看看誰能傷得了我
We will see who can score flesh.

250
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:02,540
有誰能打贏精靈 我會提拔他為…
Anyone that does, I will promote...

251
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,540
中尉
To lieutenant.

252
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:53,250
劍法的核心是平衡 而并非力量
Swordsmanship is about balance, rather than strength.

253
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:56,160
對戰要用你的雙腳 而不是雙臂
Fight with your feet. Not your arms.

254
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,700
那個精靈正在廣場上與一名士兵切磋
The Elf is fighting a soldier in the square.

255
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:41,410
腳不要站定
Don't plant roots.

256
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:43,830
要不斷移動
-Keep moving.

257
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:08,950
靠蠻力永遠無法戰勝奧克
Never trust brute force to best an Orc.

258
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:16,120
以謀略制勝往往是最容易的
It's often easiest to outmaneuver them.

259
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,870
干得好 中尉
Well done, Lieutenant.

260
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:51,120
我從來都不知道 鐵匠的助手能有這般功夫
Never known a smith's aide who could do that.

261
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,790
現在叫停這一切還為時不晚
It's not too late to stop this.

262
00:24:57,750 --> 00:25:00,660
雖然權杖在你堂姐手中 但眾人追隨的領袖是你
Your cousin may hold the scepter, but it's you the people follow.

263
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:03,160
-在眾人的幫助下 你可以… -可以什么 
-With their help you could... -Could what?

264
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:06,330
施加你的影響力
Assert your influence.

265
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:09,700
有的時候 年輕人的愚蠢足以把年長者氣哭
Sometimes the folly of youth is enough to make an old man weep.

266
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:18,370
試圖阻止戰爭算愚蠢嗎 
Is it folly to try and stop a war?

267
00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:21,750
逆流而上是愚蠢的
It's folly to kick against the current.

268
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:25,910
是這樣 潮水可能漲起來淹死人
You see, the tide may rise and drown a man,

269
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,830
也可能落潮把人卷入海里
or fall and sweep him out to sea.

270
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:32,870
控制潮水的訣竅 是要知道它接下來會朝哪個方向流動
The trick of mastering the current is to know which way it will turn next.

271
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:35,330
你曾單槍匹馬阻止了上一任國王
You all but single-handedly prevented our last king

272
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:37,160
把我們拖回老路
from dragging us back to the old ways.

273
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:39,830
別告訴我你現在無法 改變彌瑞爾的想法
Don't tell me you couldn't sway Míriel's mind now.

274
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:42,580
是什么讓你覺得 彌瑞爾和我的想法不一致 
And what makes you think Míriel's mind and my own are not as one on this?

275
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:46,330
因為我父親寧可死 也不會接受精靈的命令
Because my father would sooner die than take orders from an Elf.

276
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,700
“精靈的命令” 
"Orders from an Elf"?

277
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:21,290
等這一切結束之后 將會是精靈們聽從我們的號令
When all this has ended, Elves will take orders from us.

278
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:26,290
只要我堂姐愿意 她可以為加拉德瑞爾出戰
Now, my cousin can go to war for Galadriel if she wishes.

279
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:28,200
但我是為了努門諾爾而戰
I go to war for Númenor.

280
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:30,910
這怎么會是為努門諾爾而戰呢 
How could this be for Númenor?

281
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:33,910
你都白學了嗎 
Have you learned nothing?

282
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:38,290
很快 我們將拯救中洲的下等人
Soon, we will save the low men of Middle-earth,

283
00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:41,790
抬高他們的地位 給他們期待已久的國王
lift them up, and give them the king they've long awaited.

284
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:44,200
這個國王將永遠欠我們的債
A king who will be forever in our debt.

285
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:48,870
看你現在能不能想明白 這會對我們有什么好處
Now, contemplate, if you can, how that might benefit us.

286
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:54,540
礦石 森林 貿易 貢品…
Ores, forests, trades, tribute...

287
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,410
所以我可不敢 阻止這場戰爭 給我千金都不換
I wouldn't dare stop that. Not for all the salt in the sea.

288
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,870
你也不應該阻止這場戰爭
And neither should you.

289
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:12,200
這座王國 
The kingdom!

290
00:27:12,290 --> 00:27:16,290
-這座王國處于危險之中 我必須… -危險已經過去了 父親
-The kingdom is in danger. I must... -The danger has passed, Father.

291
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:20,540
我們正在做 您一直認為我們必須做的事情
We are doing now what you always believed we must.

292
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:24,370
我們正在恢復與精靈的關系
We're restoring our connection with the Elves.

293
00:27:26,290 --> 00:27:28,290
我要去中洲
I'm going to Middle-earth.

294
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:40,950
彌瑞爾 
Míriel?

295
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,080
我在呢 父親
Yes, Father.

296
00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:47,000
是我
It's me.

297
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:53,790
別去中洲
Don't go to Middle-earth.

298
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,120
在那里 等待你的將是…
All that awaits you there is...

299
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:03,830
是什么 父親 等待我的將是什么 
What, Father? What awaits me?

300
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,620
黑暗
Darkness.

301
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:14,750
你敢信嗎 
Can you believe it?

302
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:18,500
大家都在說你剛才做的事
Everyone's talkin' about what you did.

303
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:25,620
從來沒有見過他們 這樣滿心喜歡一個外族人
Never seen 'em take a shine to an outsider like this before.

304
00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:31,250
我給你帶了一些蜂蠟
Brought you some beeswax.

305
00:28:31,330 --> 00:28:34,750
在你那大爪子上涂一點就沒那么疼了
Slather some on that paw, should help with the tenderness.

306
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,250
嘿
Hey.

307
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:11,040
住手 求你了
Stop. Please.

308
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:18,450
敬我們兩個偉大種族之間的長久聯盟
To an enduring union between our two great peoples,

309
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:20,450
卡扎德人和諾多族
Khazad and Noldor.

310
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:22,660
-敬聯盟 -敬聯盟
-To the union. -To the union.

311
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:25,700
在我們開懷暢飲之前
Before our wines ascend,

312
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:29,080
都林大人 我想贊揚你
Lord Durin, I should like to commend you.

313
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:33,790
卡扎督姆一向被稱為 矮人王國中最安靜的一個
Khazad-d?m has been called the quietest of Dwarven kingdoms,

314
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:37,040
但是最近幾個月 據說你們的熔爐在燃燒
but in recent months, your furnaces are said to be burning

315
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:40,580
火光亮得都快趕上奧力本尊的眼睛了
as bright as the eyes of Aul? himself.

316
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:42,870
而且你們的礦井鉆得越來越深
Your mines delving ever deeper.

317
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:47,700
這股新的活力您認為出自哪里呢 
To what do you credit this new invigoration?

318
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:51,620
同樣的話我也想問林頓
I might ask the same of Lindon.

319
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:57,200
用船送走精靈戰士 擴建城市
Shipping off its warriors, expandin' its cities.

320
00:30:58,410 --> 00:31:00,290
對精靈來說有點突然 不是嗎 
Bit sudden for Elves, no?

321
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:05,330
你們每做一個決定 通常都要花他個好幾年…
Typically takes you people weeks just to decide to take a sh...

322
00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:06,790
請允許我…
If I may...

323
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:11,080
對于我們精靈而言 時間流逝得很慢
The hand of time crawls so slowly for our kind.

324
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:15,250
我們經常會把 多年的辛苦努力視為短暫的付出
We often overlook the years of effort we perceive as taking but a moment.

325
00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:18,160
希望我們這樣不會冒犯到我們的客人
In so doing, I would not wish to offend our guest.

326
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:21,500
如果能被一個真誠的提問所冒犯
I would think our Dwarven friend far too stout of heart

327
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:24,410
那這位矮人朋友未免也太頑固了
to be offended by an honest inquiry.

328
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:28,540
我有個真誠的問題想問你
I have an honest inquiry for you.

329
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:34,250
你從哪里弄來的這張桌子 
From where did you procure the table?

330
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:36,910
你為什么這么問 
Why do you ask?

331
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,580
這種石頭只分布在一定的深度
This stone grows only at certain depths.

332
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,750
特別稀少 以至于 我們的共鳴者很少能找到礦床
So rarely do our resonators locate a deposit.

333
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:48,620
我們將每一塊這種石頭 都視為珍貴的禮物
We consider each to be a precious gift.

334
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:55,830
把它留著用于最神圣的目的
We reserve its use for the most sacred purposes.

335
00:31:57,290 --> 00:32:00,290
用來建造紀念碑或墳墓
Monuments or tombs,

336
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:03,540
紀念我們尊敬的逝者
to our honored dead.

337
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:15,910
請原諒我們的褻瀆 都林大人
Please forgive our sacrilege, Lord Durin.

338
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:22,450
我們一定會讓你 把它帶回家 好讓它得到應有的尊重
We shall have to send it home with you, so it can be treated with proper respect.

339
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:30,620
很高興知道 精靈當中還是存在些許榮譽感的
It's good to know there's still some honor left among the Elves.

340
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,250
陛下
Your Grace.

341
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:37,160
那么 敬我們兩族人民的聯盟
To the union of our two peoples, then.

342
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:38,410
敬聯盟
To the union.

343
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:51,370
你對這個矮人的忠誠令人欽佩
Your loyalty to the Dwarf is admirable.

344
00:32:52,410 --> 00:32:55,160
理應這樣忠誠待友
Loyalty to a friend ought to be expected.

345
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:56,950
不論種族
Regardless of his race.

346
00:32:57,040 --> 00:33:00,250
就憑這個 你就可以向國王撒謊嗎 
Does it justify lying to your king?

347
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:04,330
至高王 我想知道 一直在對我撒謊的是不是您
I wonder, High King, if it is in fact you who has been lying to me.

348
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:12,580
我帶著友誼的提議 去了卡扎督姆 但事實上
I went to Khazad-d?m with a proposal of friendship, but in truth,

349
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:15,660
你卻在尋求 更看得見摸得著的東西 不是嗎 
you sought something far more tangible, didn't you?

350
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:19,660
你熟悉 《希斯艾格利爾山根之歌》嗎 
Are you familiar with The Song of the Roots of Hithaeglir?

351
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:21,830
請復述給我聽
-Recount it for me, please.

352
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:26,830
這是個鮮為人知的傳說 大多數人認為它是杜撰的
An obscure legend regarded by most to be a apocryphal.

353
00:33:26,910 --> 00:33:30,160
復述一遍 埃爾隆德佩瑞蒂爾（“半精靈”）
Recount it, Elrond Peredhel.

354
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:35,950
這首歌講述了一場戰斗
It speaks of a battle,

355
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:39,410
在迷霧山脈高聳的山峰之間
high among the peaks of the Misty Mountains.

356
00:33:40,290 --> 00:33:43,750
戰斗并非因榮耀 或使命而起 而是因為一棵樹
Not over honor or duty. But over a tree.

357
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:47,660
有些人稱這棵樹里 藏著最后一顆丟失的精靈寶鉆
Within which some claim was hidden the last of the lost Silmarils.

358
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:04,200
戰斗的一方是一位精靈戰士
On one side, fought an Elven warrior,

359
00:34:04,290 --> 00:34:06,250
心如曼威般純潔
with a heart as pure as Manw?,

360
00:34:06,330 --> 00:34:09,750
為了保護這棵樹 他將所有的光都傾注其中
who poured all of his light into the tree to protect it.

361
00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:12,370
戰斗的另一方是魔茍斯的一個炎魔
-On the other, a Balrog of Morgoth,

362
00:34:12,410 --> 00:34:15,910
把他所有的仇恨 都傳導到這棵樹上 以求將其摧毀
who channeled all his hatred into the tree to destroy it.

363
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:20,870
在他們無休止的決斗中 閃電擊中了這棵樹…
Amidst their duel unending, lightning ensnared the tree...

364
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:28,040
使他們的對抗造就了一股力量…
Forging of their conflict, a power...

365
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:32,870
這股力量如善良一般純凈而輕盈
A power as pure and light as good.

366
00:34:32,950 --> 00:34:35,950
又像邪惡一樣堅強不屈
As strong and unyielding as evil.

367
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:39,950
他們說這股力量從樹根滲入大山深處
They say it seeped down the roots into the mountain depths,

368
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:44,120
幾個世紀以來 它一直在等待
where for centuries now, it has waited.

369
00:34:45,410 --> 00:34:46,580
都林說對了
Durin was right.

370
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:49,000
那你就是承認矮人確實找到了它
Then you admit the Dwarves did find it.

371
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:52,160
那種礦石蘊含著丟失的精靈寶鉆之光
The ore containing the light of the lost Silmaril.

372
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:54,080
我只承認這一點
I admit only this.

373
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:57,040
我答應過都林永遠不會 泄露他子民的秘密
I promised Durin never to reveal his people's secrets.

374
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:01,580
如果說 信守對他子民的承諾
And what if keeping your promise to his people

375
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:04,500
意味著你的同胞就要厄運難逃呢 
meant ensuring the doom of your own?

376
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:42,870
我們第一次注意到這種情況 剛好在加拉德瑞爾回來之前
We first took notice of it just prior to Galadriel's return.

377
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:44,750
當時我們希望通過把她送走
We hoped that by sending her away,

378
00:35:44,830 --> 00:35:48,540
抹去戰爭最后的痕跡
and so bringing an end to the last vestiges of war,

379
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:50,830
從而就此阻止樹的枯萎
we might arrest the decay.

380
00:35:51,910 --> 00:35:54,750
但盡管我們竭盡全力
But despite our every effort,

381
00:35:54,830 --> 00:35:57,750
枯萎還是加速了
our decline has only quickened.

382
00:35:58,750 --> 00:36:01,950
這棵樹表面上的枯萎反映了它
The blight upon this tree is but an outer manifestation

383
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,580
內在的實質
of an inner reality.

384
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:06,580
靈族之光
That the light of the Eldar,

385
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:10,080
也就是我們的光 正在消逝
our light, is fading.

386
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:14,450
還有誰知道這件事 
Who else knows about this?

387
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,450
只有極少數
Precious few.

388
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:22,750
我再問最后一次
I ask again, and for the last time,

389
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:27,750
矮人是不是找到了那種礦石 
did the Dwarves find the ore or not?

390
00:36:32,330 --> 00:36:35,500
我向都林發過誓
I swore an oath to Durin.

391
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:42,160
對有些人來說 如今發誓可能并沒有多大意義了
To some, that may now hold little weight.

392
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:47,120
但在我看來
But in my esteem,

393
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,700
正是誓言才讓 我們的靈魂緊緊連接在一起
it is by such things our very souls are bound.

394
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:56,830
我不打算僅僅為了希望而違背誓言
I do not intend to let mine slip away on the basis of mere hope.

395
00:36:58,330 --> 00:37:02,500
希望從來都不是微不足道的 埃爾隆德…
Hope is never mere, Elrond...

396
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:05,500
即便希望很渺茫
even when it is meager.

397
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:09,040
當所有其他感官都睡著了
When all other senses sleep,

398
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:13,410
希望之眼會率先醒來 最后一個閉上
the eye of hope is first to awaken, last to shut.

399
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:19,700
如果精靈現在放棄中洲
If the Elves abandon Middle-earth now,

400
00:37:19,790 --> 00:37:24,450
黑暗大軍將會在中洲大地上橫行
the armies of darkness will march over the face of the earth.

401
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:25,790
那將會是末日
It will be the end,

402
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:30,000
不僅是我們精靈族的末日 還是所有種族的末日
not just of our people, but all peoples.

403
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:34,580
如果能防止這種情況發生的希望
If the hope of preventing that is not reason enough

404
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:37,120
還不足以讓你重新考慮你的誓言
to make you reconsider your oath,

405
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:40,120
那你不妨再找一條出路
I suggest you find another.

406
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:10,660
由諸神之手創造
What was the land immortal hands

407
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:14,000
從隔離之海中升起的那地是何地 
Rose up from Sundering Sea?

408
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:17,410
恩賜之地 星引之地
-Land of the gift, land of the star

409
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:20,910
將永遠閃耀 
To shine eternally?

410
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,450
那是努門諾爾 美麗的努門諾爾
'Twas Númenor Fair Númenor

411
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:27,870
明亮之島充滿了恩惠優雅…
Bright isle filled with grace...

412
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:32,080
我就說不會有危險的
I said it won't be dangerous.

413
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:35,040
我打賭等我下船的時候 一切就都結束了
I wager it'll all be over by the time I get off the boat.

414
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:36,500
但不要告訴我父親
Just don't tell my father.

415
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:40,500
他逢人便夸 未來的女婿是個戰爭英雄
He keeps crowing to everyone with ears, his future son-in-law's a war hero.

416
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:43,160
歌唱吧 來吧 唱起來
Sing! Come on, sing.

417
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:44,950
你還記得歌詞吧 
You remember the words, don't you?

418
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:49,000
聽你鬼哭狼嚎了一宿 恐怕歌詞我永遠都忘不掉了
After hearing you squawk them all night, I fear I'll never forget them.

419
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:52,540
也許伊熙爾杜會和你一起唱
Perhaps Isildur will sing with you.

420
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,790
這就有意思了
This should be interesting.

421
00:38:56,870 --> 00:39:02,120
讓我們偉大的島嶼永遠屹立 讓我們的劍戰勝死亡
Make our great land to ever stand Our swords to conquer death

422
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:05,080
-答案是不行 -我還什么都沒說呢
-The answer's no. -I haven't said anything yet.

423
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,370
我認識你15年了
I've known you 15 years.

424
00:39:06,450 --> 00:39:08,830
你真覺得 我不知道你來是要說什么嗎 
You think I don't know what you're here to say?

425
00:39:08,910 --> 00:39:11,200
-其實是16年 但我的意思是… -安塔摩
-It's actually 16, but I mean... -Ontamo.

426
00:39:11,290 --> 00:39:13,750
好吧 我來是要說什么 
Right. What have I come to say?

427
00:39:13,830 --> 00:39:16,450
你要非常誠懇地道歉 當然了 安塔摩肯定會
A fairly lavish apology, which Ontamo, of course,

428
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:19,000
立馬接受道歉 但我可不會
would've accepted instantly, but I wouldn't have.

429
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:20,580
你知道為什么嗎 
And do you know why?

430
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:25,580
你愿意道歉 只是因為你覺得現在我升職了
You're only apologizing because you think now that I've been promoted,

431
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:27,540
我可以帶你參加遠征軍
I can get you on the expedition.

432
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:33,410
-可以帶我嗎  -我就說吧
-Can you? -Right.

433
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:38,160
我只想說 我不會馬上接受你的道歉
I'd just like to say, I wouldn't have accepted instantly.

434
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:40,160
-我很高興你道歉了 -他沒有
-But I am glad that you apologized. -No, he didn't.

435
00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:41,540
我道歉了 
I did!

436
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:45,080
但我很樂意再道一次 對不起 是我挑起了那次爭執
But I'll gladly do it again. I'm sorry I started the fight.

437
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:48,450
現在請帶上我吧
Now please bring me with you.

438
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:50,830
不行
No.

439
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:55,620
我到底要怎么做才能彌補過錯 
What'll it take to make this right?

440
00:39:56,370 --> 00:39:57,870
好吧 你可以隨便打我一拳
Fine, you get a free hit.

441
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:01,370
下巴或肚子都可以 任打一拳
Jaw, gut, your choice. One hit.

442
00:40:04,250 --> 00:40:05,250
三
Three.

443
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:07,290
二
Uh, two.

444
00:40:07,870 --> 00:40:08,870
其實…
-Actually...

445
00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:15,250
我感覺被打了三拳
That felt like three.

446
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:23,250
好了 那你們能帶我上船嗎 
So, you'll bring me on the ship?

447
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:27,200
伊熙爾杜 你是我相處最久的朋友
Isildur, you're my oldest friend.

448
00:40:28,950 --> 00:40:32,000
說實話 現在你可能 仍然是我最好的朋友 但是…
And if you want to know the truth, you're probably still my best, but...

449
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:34,080
-怎么了  -安塔摩 拜托了
-What? -Ontamo, please.

450
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:37,080
不行 憑良心 我不能為你背書
I can't, in good conscience, stake my name

451
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:40,160
推薦你履行一項你可能會放棄的職責
recommending you for a duty that you might well decide to abandon.

452
00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:42,370
這次會不一樣的
-It'll be different this time. -Hmm.

453
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:45,870
我也希望有一天會不一樣
One day, I hope it will be.

454
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:50,330
我也希望有一天你能找到
One day, I hope you find something

455
00:40:50,410 --> 00:40:53,410
愿意為之犧牲一切的東西
that you would be willing to sacrifice anything for.

456
00:40:55,830 --> 00:40:58,330
我會替你照顧貝雷克的 我保證
I'll take care of Berek for you. I promise.

457
00:40:58,750 --> 00:41:00,080
貝雷克要去 
Berek's going?

458
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,830
馴馬師把他招來了
The horsemaster recruited him.

459
00:41:04,330 --> 00:41:07,750
抱歉 伊熙爾杜 大海永遠是正確的
Sorry, Isil. The sea is always right.

460
00:41:57,160 --> 00:42:00,000
你是要偷渡出去嗎 
Are you stowing away?

461
00:42:08,250 --> 00:42:09,870
你是要把這艘船燒掉嗎 
Are you about to burn the boat?

462
00:42:09,950 --> 00:42:13,660
馬上離開這里 我不會告訴任何人我看到過你
Get out of here this moment. I won't let anyone know I saw you.

463
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:16,200
-把燈遞給我 -別過來
-Hand me the lantern. -Don't.

464
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:18,330
把燈給我 
-Give it.

465
00:42:51,410 --> 00:42:53,410
把大家召集起來 快點 
Gather every hand. Hurry!

466
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:56,540
把他們救上來 快點
Get them out. Quickly.

467
00:42:57,620 --> 00:42:59,620
把他們救上來  伊熙爾杜 
Get them out! Isildur?

468
00:43:08,330 --> 00:43:09,500
伊熙爾杜 
Isildur?

469
00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:12,700
怎么回事 
What happened?

470
00:43:13,410 --> 00:43:16,580
他剛才在一艘漁船上 一定是有酒桶爆炸了
He was in a fishing boat. A cask must've gone up.

471
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:17,830
酒桶 
-A cask?

472
00:43:19,910 --> 00:43:21,290
他救了我的命
He saved my life.

473
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,580
他本可以丟下我 但他卻救了我的命
He could've just left, but he saved my life.

474
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:25,910
船長 
Captain!

475
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:45,330
我們有理由懷疑 是一個經過的強盜所為
We have reason to suspect a passing brigand,

476
00:43:45,410 --> 00:43:47,330
但暫時還沒有確認其身份
but we've yet to identify him.

477
00:43:47,410 --> 00:43:51,000
我們很走運 其他的船只沒有被燒毀
We're fortunate we didn't lose the rest of the ships as well.

478
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:54,830
這顯然是意圖激起你的疑慮 攝政女王
This was clearly an attempt to kindle your doubts, Queen Regent.

479
00:43:54,910 --> 00:43:58,200
-別上當 -我不敢茍同精靈的看法
-Do not let it. -I'm forced to disagree with the Elf.

480
00:43:58,290 --> 00:44:00,700
也許我們確實操之過急了
Perhaps we did act in haste.

481
00:44:00,790 --> 00:44:03,250
王國應該被帶領 而不是被拖拽著走
A kingdom should be led. Not dragged.

482
00:44:03,330 --> 00:44:05,120
我建議推遲出航
I recommend we delay the voyage

483
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:07,910
先為您的事業贏得更多的民心
until we've had time enough to win more hearts to your cause.

484
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:12,000
敵人一天比一天強大 也許每猶豫一小時 敵人就更強大些
Our enemy grows stronger every day. Perhaps every hour we hesitate.

485
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:15,370
要記住你為什么 選擇了這條路 記住你的信念
Remember why you chose this path. Remember your faith.

486
00:44:15,450 --> 00:44:17,580
你覺得我能忘記嗎 
Do you think I could forget?

487
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:22,540
我們還有三艘船 而且還有你父親的祝福
We still have three ships. And your father's blessing.

488
00:44:26,370 --> 00:44:27,950
哈爾布蘭德大人呢 
What of Lord Halbrand?

489
00:44:28,790 --> 00:44:30,290
他在等待我們啟航
He awaits our departure.

490
00:44:30,370 --> 00:44:31,790
可不是嘛
I'm sure he does.

491
00:44:36,370 --> 00:44:38,790
我要不要讓海上衛隊先撤下來 
Shall I tell the Sea Guard to stand down?

492
00:44:44,410 --> 00:44:48,450
天一亮就重新召開會議 做最后的決定
This council will reconvene at first light to make a final decision.

493
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:52,830
要確保哈爾布蘭德大人參會
See to it Lord Halbrand attends.

494
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:03,870
你能確定的是什么 
What have you been able to ascertain?

495
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:06,000
埃爾隆德 原諒我
Elrond, forgive me.

496
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:07,870
原諒你 
Forgive you?

497
00:45:07,950 --> 00:45:10,000
原諒我沒有早點告訴你
That I did not tell you sooner.

498
00:45:14,250 --> 00:45:15,450
原來你早就知道的
You knew.

499
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:19,830
從一開始 我就求至高王把我們的秘密告訴你
I begged him to allow you into our confidence from the start,

500
00:45:19,910 --> 00:45:21,750
但他不同意這樣做
but the High King forbade it.

501
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:27,120
這個秘銀…
And this... this mithril...

502
00:45:29,290 --> 00:45:31,000
這是我們唯一的救贖嗎 
It is our only salvation?

503
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:35,120
埃爾隆德 我在各種惡劣條件下都測試過它
Elrond, I have tested it under every duress.

504
00:45:36,290 --> 00:45:39,000
任何事物都無法削弱它的光
Nothing diminishes its light.

505
00:45:39,950 --> 00:45:44,450
我們相信 如果能快速獲得大量秘銀
We believe if we can secure vast quantities of it quickly,

506
00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:49,950
多到足以再次 讓每一個精靈浸潤在維拉之光中…
enough to saturate every last Elf in the light of the Valar once more...

507
00:45:52,620 --> 00:45:53,950
那么 是的
Then, yes.

508
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:58,250
是的 它是我們唯一的救贖
Yes. It very well could be.

509
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:09,500
抱歉
I am sorry.

510
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:13,330
至高王騙了我 
That the High King deceived me?

511
00:46:15,250 --> 00:46:18,750
還是說 我們精靈 注定要滅亡 除非我違背誓言 
Or that now our people are doomed unless I break an oath?

512
00:46:20,540 --> 00:46:21,950
背叛朋友 
And betray a friend?

513
00:46:23,830 --> 00:46:29,250
埃爾隆德 你父親啟航的那個晚上我在場
I was there, Elrond, the night your father set sail.

514
00:46:32,450 --> 00:46:37,290
他一介凡人 相信自己可以說服眾神
A mortal man, who believed he could convince the very Gods

515
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:40,910
讓他們參戰幫助我們
to come to war in our aid.

516
00:46:42,910 --> 00:46:46,200
我聽到你媽媽懇求他不要去
I heard your mother pleading with him not to go,

517
00:46:46,290 --> 00:46:50,120
要求他 哀求他別去 問他為什么非他不可
asking him, imploring him, why, why must it be him?

518
00:46:52,370 --> 00:46:54,120
你知道你父親說了什么嗎 
And do you know what he said?

519
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:02,120
他說因為他是 唯一一個能做這件事的人
Because he was the only one who could do it.

520
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:25,790
我錯了 不應該利用你
I was wrong to use you.

521
00:47:26,870 --> 00:47:28,290
對此 我很抱歉
For that, I'm sorry.

522
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:33,540
明天 女王會傳喚你覲見
Tomorrow, the queen will call you to audience.

523
00:47:33,620 --> 00:47:38,290
你在會面上的態度 很可能會決定這次任務的成敗
Your voice at that meeting may well decide whether this mission stands or falls.

524
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:42,040
-幫幫我 -我想我已經幫你夠多了
-Help me. -I think I've helped you quite enough.

525
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:45,080
那就幫幫你自己
Then help yourself.

526
00:47:45,830 --> 00:47:48,750
別再和我內斗了 跟我一起與敵人戰斗
Stop fighting me, and together, let us fight them.

527
00:47:49,410 --> 00:47:53,750
不久前 我這類人卻還在與敵人為伍
Not so long ago, men like me were fighting alongside them.

528
00:47:53,830 --> 00:47:55,500
但那是你的同胞 并不包括你
Men like you. Not you, yourself.

529
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,160
你錯了
You're wrong.

530
00:48:07,330 --> 00:48:11,750
你不知道 我在坐上那艘木筏之前做了什么
You don't know what I did before I ended up on that raft.

531
00:48:16,580 --> 00:48:18,410
你不知道我是怎么活下來的
You don't know how I survived.

532
00:48:27,370 --> 00:48:28,870
我們所有人是如何得以幸存的
How we all survived.

533
00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:38,950
如果被這些人發現 他們會把我趕出去
And when these people discover it, they will cast me out.

534
00:48:40,450 --> 00:48:41,660
你也一樣
So will you.

535
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:48,660
有時候要找到光 我們必須先觸及黑暗
Sometimes to find the light, we must first touch the darkness.

536
00:48:52,450 --> 00:48:54,200
你對黑暗了解多少 
What do you know of darkness?

537
00:48:58,250 --> 00:49:00,080
加拉德瑞爾 那把短劍是誰的 
Whose dagger was it, Galadriel?

538
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:02,580
你失去的是誰 
Who is it you lost?

539
00:49:03,830 --> 00:49:04,830
我哥哥
My brother.

540
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:06,750
他出什么事了 
What happened to him?

541
00:49:06,830 --> 00:49:08,450
他被殺害了
He was killed.

542
00:49:08,540 --> 00:49:10,790
在一個充斥著黑暗和絕望的地方
In a place of darkness and despair.

543
00:49:10,870 --> 00:49:13,580
被索隆的仆從所殺 這樣你滿意了吧 
By servants of Sauron. Is that enough for you?

544
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:15,160
所以這是為了復仇 
So this is about vengeance?

545
00:49:15,250 --> 00:49:17,620
區區復仇遠遠無法讓我滿足
One cannot satisfy thirst by drinking seawater.

546
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:20,250
那到底是為了什么  你為什么要一直戰斗 
Then what is it? Why do you keep fighting?

547
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:25,250
你是在要我去一個 我發誓永遠不會回去的地方
You are asking me to go to the one place that I swore never to return.

548
00:49:25,330 --> 00:49:27,620
所以起碼你可以告訴我為什么
The least you can do is tell me why.

549
00:49:29,370 --> 00:49:31,160
你為什么要一直戰斗 
Why do you keep fighting?

550
00:49:31,250 --> 00:49:33,000
因為我停不下來
Because I cannot stop.

551
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:49,370
我領導的軍隊對我倒戈相向
The company I led mutinied against me.

552
00:49:51,750 --> 00:49:55,950
我最親密的朋友 與至高王密謀將我流放
My closest friend conspired with the king to exile me.

553
00:49:56,500 --> 00:50:00,370
我相信他們每個人之所以這樣做…
And each of them acted as they did...

554
00:50:03,910 --> 00:50:07,160
是因為他們再也無法將我…
Because I believe they could no longer distinguish me...

555
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:10,200
與我正在抗爭的邪惡區分開來
from the evil I was fighting.

556
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:17,410
我很遺憾
I'm sorry.

557
00:50:20,910 --> 00:50:22,250
你哥哥的犧牲
For your brother.

558
00:50:23,450 --> 00:50:24,700
以及所有這一切
For all of it.

559
00:50:25,750 --> 00:50:27,000
我替你感到難過
I'm sorry.

560
00:50:28,330 --> 00:50:30,870
你的悲傷無法減輕我的痛苦
Your sorrow cannot ease my pain.

561
00:50:32,660 --> 00:50:35,160
屈尊當個鐵匠也不會減輕你的痛苦
And nor will a hammer and tongs ease yours.

562
00:50:36,620 --> 00:50:39,410
你在這里不會找到內心的平靜
There is no peace to be found for you here.

563
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:41,000
我也找不到
And nor for me.

564
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:43,500
持久的平靜在這里無處可尋
No lasting peace in any path,

565
00:50:43,580 --> 00:50:45,910
只能在隔離之海的對岸覓得
but that which lies across the sea.

566
00:50:47,580 --> 00:50:50,580
我已經戰斗了幾個世紀 試圖得到我內心的平靜
I have fought for centuries, seeking to earn mine.

567
00:50:52,370 --> 00:50:54,080
你也得這樣做才能獲得平靜
This is how you earn yours.

568
00:51:14,330 --> 00:51:16,330
這一天我已經等待很久了
Long have I awaited this day.

569
00:51:17,660 --> 00:51:20,500
等待您的同類終將歸來的這天
The day your kind would return at last,

570
00:51:21,450 --> 00:51:26,000
把我們從淤泥和污穢中拯救出來
lift us up from the muck and the filth,

571
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:30,950
讓我們在您身邊找回自己的位置
to take our rightful place at your side.

572
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:36,660
我向您保證我對您的忠誠至死不渝
I pledge my undying service to you.

573
00:51:39,620 --> 00:51:43,250
我向索隆宣誓效忠
I pledge my loyalty to Sauron.

574
00:52:03,950 --> 00:52:05,950
您是索隆吧 
You are Sauron, are you not?

575
00:52:16,790 --> 00:52:18,580
嘿…等等…
Hey, hey... Wait...

576
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:24,830
那無論您是誰 我都效忠于您
I'll serve you, then. Whoever you are.

577
00:52:37,620 --> 00:52:40,040
只有雙手沾血才能證明忠誠
Only blood can bind.

578
00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:49,870
沃德雷格 
Waldreg?

579
00:52:58,330 --> 00:52:59,580
沃德雷格…
Waldreg...

580
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:03,540
沃德雷格 不要
Waldreg, no.

581
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:06,410
不要…
No.

582
00:53:07,790 --> 00:53:08,870
不要…
No.

583
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:14,160
不要…
-No.

584
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:16,160
不要 
No!

585
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:21,290
下次瞄高一點
Lift your aim next time.

586
00:53:24,370 --> 00:53:26,580
別那么害怕弓弦
And don't be so afraid of the string.

587
00:53:27,250 --> 00:53:29,080
何苦要費心教我 
Why bother trying to teach me?

588
00:53:30,950 --> 00:53:33,660
因為我花了兩百多年
Because it took me over 200 years

589
00:53:33,750 --> 00:53:37,410
才有了今晚站在這里的勇氣
to develop the bravery that's keeping me standing here tonight.

590
00:53:38,790 --> 00:53:40,660
而你僅僅14歲就有這樣的勇氣了
You found it in only 14.

591
00:53:41,790 --> 00:53:43,580
戰斗中我們需要這種勇氣
And we're going to need it in the fight to come.

592
00:53:43,660 --> 00:53:46,040
在我一生中 你們精靈一直監視著我們
All my life, your kind has watched us.

593
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:47,870
清點我們說過的每一句悄悄話
Counting every whisper.

594
00:53:48,660 --> 00:53:50,830
留意每一把過于鋒利的餐刀
Every kitchen knife too sharp.

595
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:54,660
我們都快要被埋在這座瞭望塔里了
We're all about to be buried in this tower.

596
00:53:54,750 --> 00:53:56,540
何苦還要跟我們一起陪葬呢 
So why be buried with us?

597
00:53:58,410 --> 00:54:01,250
因為在清點悄悄話和餐刀的時候
Because in counting the whispers and the knives,

598
00:54:01,330 --> 00:54:04,950
我開始了解在它們背后的活生生的人
I've come to know the voices and the hands of those behind them.

599
00:54:06,250 --> 00:54:07,750
我們的人已經走了一半
Half of us just left.

600
00:54:08,830 --> 00:54:10,660
但還有一半選擇了留下
But half stayed.

601
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:13,200
包括你
Including you.

602
00:54:19,830 --> 00:54:21,330
所以 瞄高一點
So lift your aim.

603
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:41,080
有件事你不知道
There's something you don't know.

604
00:54:49,410 --> 00:54:50,910
我以前見過這個
I've seen this before.

605
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:40,250
這是一把鑰匙
It is a key.

606
00:55:42,370 --> 00:55:46,870
敵人用一些失傳的手藝所制 用來奴役你的祖先
Conjured by some forgotten craft of the enemy, to enslave your ancestors.

607
00:55:46,950 --> 00:55:48,500
是什么的鑰匙 
A key to what?

608
00:55:51,870 --> 00:55:53,290
我不知道
I do not know.

609
00:55:53,370 --> 00:55:56,160
敵方指揮官說過要成為神
The enemy commander spoke of becoming a god.

610
00:55:56,250 --> 00:55:58,910
要在這些土地上給奧克一個家
Of giving the Orcs a home in these lands.

611
00:55:59,910 --> 00:56:02,580
但不管他有什么陰謀 有一點是肯定的
But whatever his design, this much is certain.

612
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:08,290
敵人知道你兒子 有他需要用來啟動計劃的東西
Our enemy knows your son has what he needs to enact it.

613
00:56:14,450 --> 00:56:15,660
要多久 
How long?

614
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:18,370
幾天吧
Days.

615
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:22,450
也可能是幾個小時
Maybe hours.

616
00:56:27,410 --> 00:56:29,120
我們會活下來的 布隆溫
We can survive this, Bronwyn.

617
00:56:29,790 --> 00:56:31,200
有辦法
There is a way.

618
00:56:32,790 --> 00:56:33,950
肯定有
There must be.

619
00:56:37,660 --> 00:56:39,080
的確有一個辦法
There is one.

620
00:56:40,330 --> 00:56:44,040
不行 向敵人低頭 意味著你就奪走了一切
No! Bow to the enemy, and you take away everything.

621
00:56:45,620 --> 00:56:47,620
奪走了子孫后代的一切
From your son, and his sons after him.

622
00:56:49,330 --> 00:56:53,330
你們祖輩辛勤勞作了 整整一個紀元 才贏回了自己的品性
Your people have worked an entire age to earn back their virtue.

623
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:57,160
僅僅因為一時的絕望 你就要讓它前功盡棄嗎 
Would you undo it all in just one moment of despair?

624
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:02,080
肯定還有別的辦法
There must be another way.

625
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:04,660
那說出來聽聽 我求你了
Name it. I beg you.

626
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:11,200
我沒說錯吧 
See?

627
00:57:12,700 --> 00:57:14,700
你們盯著我們是對的
You were right to watch us.

628
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:18,450
因為我們注定要墮入黑暗
Because we are destined for the darkness.

629
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:21,660
這就是我們的生存方式
It's how we survive.

630
00:57:24,830 --> 00:57:26,410
也許我們就是這樣的人
Perhaps it's who we are.

631
00:57:28,330 --> 00:57:29,830
永遠將會是這樣的人
Who we will always be.

632
00:57:30,750 --> 00:57:35,370
處于風險之中的 可遠遠不只有我們的性命
There's far more at stake here than just our lives.

633
00:57:36,750 --> 00:57:40,660
當年魔茍斯開戰 整個貝烈瑞安德都淪陷了
When Morgoth was at war, whole continents sank.

634
00:57:40,750 --> 00:57:43,410
有誰能說得出 這次會引發什么樣的可怕后果
Who is to say what horrors this might unleash,

635
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:45,160
就應該讓敵人得逞嗎 
should our enemy obtain it?

636
00:57:45,250 --> 00:57:47,250
我們有什么力量去阻止他 
What power do we have to stop him?

637
00:57:47,870 --> 00:57:49,790
看看周圍 已經完蛋了
Look around. It's over.

638
00:57:49,870 --> 00:57:51,660
-還沒有 -很快就要完蛋了
-Not yet. -Soon enough.

639
00:57:53,410 --> 00:57:55,950
等敵人向我們進軍時 這座瞭望塔就會倒下
And when they march upon us, this tower will fall.

640
00:58:13,870 --> 00:58:14,910
戰斗 
Nampat!

641
00:58:18,250 --> 00:58:19,160
戰斗 
Nampat!

642
00:58:22,330 --> 00:58:23,410
戰斗 
Nampat!

643
00:58:26,290 --> 00:58:27,450
戰斗 
Nampat!

644
00:58:30,450 --> 00:58:31,500
戰斗 
Nampat!

645
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:36,120
戰斗 
Nampat!

646
00:58:59,910 --> 00:59:02,000
剛才你是瞎編的 不是嗎 
You made it up, didn't you?

647
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:04,910
迪莎多年來 一直想要一張新桌子 所以…
Disa's been wanting a new table for years, so...

648
00:59:12,370 --> 00:59:14,120
快得了 這桌子哪有那么重
Ah, come on, it's not that heavy.

649
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:17,200
讓我感到負擔沉重的 不是這張桌子的重量
It is not the weight of the table that burdens me.

650
00:59:18,040 --> 00:59:19,660
那你為什么不說出來 
So why don't you come out with it?

651
00:59:19,750 --> 00:59:22,620
因為負擔拿出來分擔 有可能會減半 也有可能會加倍
Because a burden shared may either be halved or doubled.

652
00:59:22,700 --> 00:59:24,870
取決于聽話人的同理心
-Depending on the heart that receives it.

653
00:59:24,950 --> 00:59:28,750
奧力的胡子啊 你別繞彎子了
Aul?'s beard! Enough with the quail sauce.

654
00:59:28,830 --> 00:59:31,830
大大方方說 不用避諱
Give me the meat, and give it to me raw.

655
00:59:37,580 --> 00:59:40,000
我沒有對你說實話 都林
I have not been truthful with you, Durin.

656
00:59:41,950 --> 00:59:45,370
我來卡扎督姆 并非為了友誼 而是有目的而來
I did not come to Khazad-d?m for friendship, but ambition.

657
00:59:46,330 --> 00:59:47,750
但我之前并不知情
I did not know it.

658
00:59:50,290 --> 00:59:51,910
我此行的任務是尋找秘銀
But I came for mithril.

659
00:59:58,040 --> 00:59:59,290
為什么 
Why?

660
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:02,410
如果沒有秘銀
Without it,

661
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:07,910
我們精靈族要么 得在春天離開這些海岸 要么滅亡
my kind must either abandon these shores by spring, or perish.

662
01:00:09,790 --> 01:00:11,040
滅亡 
Perish?

663
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:14,160
怎么滅亡 
Perish how?

664
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:21,830
我們不朽的靈魂將化為烏有
Our immortal souls will dwindle into nothing,

665
01:00:23,540 --> 01:00:25,160
慢慢衰減耗盡
slowly diminishing,

666
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:27,830
直到我們變成虛影
until we are but shadows,

667
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:31,910
被時間的潮汐沖走
swept away by the tides of time.

668
01:00:33,750 --> 01:00:35,000
永不復生
Forever.

669
01:00:48,950 --> 01:00:54,700
所以整個精靈族的命運 都掌握在我手中 
So the fate of the entire Elven race is in my hands?

670
01:00:55,700 --> 01:00:57,410
看起來是這樣的
So it would appear.

671
01:01:03,620 --> 01:01:05,040
再說一次
Say that again.

672
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:11,330
整個精靈族的命運都掌握在你手中
The fate of the entire Elven race is in your hands.

673
01:01:20,040 --> 01:01:21,450
誰的手中 
Whose hands?

674
01:01:23,750 --> 01:01:25,160
你的
Yours.

675
01:01:40,410 --> 01:01:43,540
收起你那軟弱的玻璃心 我們走吧
Fetch your feathery shirts. Let's start walking.

676
01:01:43,620 --> 01:01:46,000
-都林… -先別急著謝我
-Durin... -Don't thank me yet.

677
01:01:46,080 --> 01:01:48,830
等我們想辦法 說服我父親之后 再謝我吧
Thank me after we find a way to convince my father.

678
01:01:48,910 --> 01:01:51,120
現在我們可以動身了嗎 
Now can we please get moving?

679
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:53,040
回去的路很長
It's a long journey back.

680
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:56,620
這些陽光都開始讓我胃不舒服了
And all this sunlight is startin' to give me a sour stomach.

681
01:01:56,700 --> 01:02:00,290
有個條件 你告訴迪莎這張桌子是我給的
Under one condition. Tell Disa the table's from me.

682
01:02:00,370 --> 01:02:02,120
你別得寸進尺 精靈
Don't push your luck, Elf.

683
01:02:22,830 --> 01:02:25,660
哈爾布蘭德大人 攝政女王召見您
Lord Halbrand, the Queen Regent summons you.

684
01:04:35,250 --> 01:04:38,250
看看是誰又靠他爹弄到了一個位置啊
Look whose father secured him a post. Again.

685
01:04:40,330 --> 01:04:42,200
我是自己爭取到的 和你一樣
I earned mine. Same as you.

686
01:04:42,290 --> 01:04:43,500
士兵
Soldier.

687
01:04:46,750 --> 01:04:48,330
去向馴馬師報道
Report to the horsemaster.

688
01:04:49,700 --> 01:04:51,200
我以為我是騎兵
Thought I was in cavalry.

689
01:04:51,290 --> 01:04:52,620
你的確是
You are.

690
01:04:55,950 --> 01:04:57,200
負責清掃馬廄
Stable sweep.

691
01:05:16,790 --> 01:05:17,620
士兵們 
Soldiers!

692
01:06:06,700 --> 01:06:08,000
解開繩索 
Clear the lines!

693
01:06:08,660 --> 01:06:10,160
揚帆遠航 
Square the sail!

694
01:06:10,580 --> 01:06:12,250
我們朝東北方向行進
We head nor'-east.

695
01:06:13,950 --> 01:06:15,200
前往中洲
For Middle-earth.

696
01:06:16,790 --> 01:06:18,000
耶 
Yes!

697
01:07:10,450 --> 01:07:13,750
太陽正在落下
The sun is fast falling

698
01:07:13,830 --> 01:07:17,200
落在森巖的樹林后方
Beneath trees of stone

699
01:07:17,290 --> 01:07:20,250
塔中之光
The light in the tower

700
01:07:20,330 --> 01:07:23,370
不再是家鄉
No longer my home

701
01:07:23,450 --> 01:07:26,160
過去燈火朦朧
Past eyes of pale fire

702
01:07:26,250 --> 01:07:29,500
黑沙做我的睡床
Black sand for my bed

703
01:07:29,580 --> 01:07:31,910
我用所知的一切
I trade all I've known

704
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:36,700
換取未知的未來
For the unknown ahead

705
01:07:36,790 --> 01:07:42,040
呼喚我 遙遠之地 請呼喚我
Call to me Call to me lands far away

706
01:07:42,120 --> 01:07:47,830
因為我現在 必須在這流浪的日子里游蕩
For I must now wander this wandering day

707
01:07:47,910 --> 01:07:50,500
我必須游蕩
Away I must wander

708
01:07:50,580 --> 01:07:55,160
在這流浪的日子里
This wandering day

709
01:07:55,250 --> 01:07:57,750
我缺水
Of drink I have little

710
01:07:57,830 --> 01:08:00,870
我少食
And food I have less

711
01:08:00,950 --> 01:08:06,330
我的力量告訴我不行 但是這條路要求我踏足
My strength tells me no But the path demands yes

712
01:08:06,410 --> 01:08:12,370
我雙腿很短 而道阻且長
My legs are so short And the way is so long

713
01:08:12,450 --> 01:08:15,370
無法休息 何談舒適
I've no rest nor comfort

714
01:08:15,450 --> 01:08:20,250
無所慰藉 唯有歌聲
No comfort, but song

715
01:08:20,330 --> 01:08:25,700
為我歌唱 遙遠之地 請為我歌唱
Sing to me, sing to me Lands far away

716
01:08:25,790 --> 01:08:31,250
請起身指引我度過這流浪的日子
Oh, rise up and guide me This wandering day

717
01:08:31,330 --> 01:08:34,200
請答應要找到我
Please promise to find me

718
01:08:34,290 --> 01:08:39,040
在這流浪的日子里
This wandering day

719
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:41,910
最終 他們的答案來了
At last comes their answer

720
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,950
穿過寒冷和霜凍
Through cold and through frost

721
01:08:45,040 --> 01:08:50,750
并非所有的流浪者都身陷迷途
That not all who wonder or wander are lost

722
01:08:50,830 --> 01:08:53,620
不論悲傷
No matter the sorrow

723
01:08:53,700 --> 01:08:56,700
不計成本
No matter the cost

724
01:08:56,790 --> 01:09:02,790
并非所有的流浪者都身陷迷途
