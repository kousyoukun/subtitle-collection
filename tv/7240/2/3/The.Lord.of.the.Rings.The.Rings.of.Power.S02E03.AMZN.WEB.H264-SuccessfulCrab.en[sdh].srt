00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:29,958
That, and an eagle.

169
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:32,750
It is rare for an eagle
to grace a coronation.

170
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:39,625
Should one make an appearance at yours,
it would be seen as an auspicious omen.

171
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:42,458
The white, then.

172
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:44,750
I'm partial to the red.

173
00:14:45,791 --> 00:14:49,291
"Like the sun, rises a new monarch."

174
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:53,333
It will show the people
you're a new kind of ruler for a new day.

175
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:56,458
They need change.

176
00:14:56,541 --> 00:14:59,166
The white. It is humbler.

177
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,208
As you prefer.

178
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:17,708
[Kemen] She's the same as her father,
she's never going to change.

179
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:21,083
She's suffered an infirmity.
She's no longer fit to rule.

180
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:22,916
-[Lord Belzagar laughs]
-Why laugh? It's the truth.

181
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,750
It is the ale talking.
It would be wise to lower its voice.

182
00:15:26,833 --> 00:15:28,625
All the same, the boy's not wrong.

183
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:31,333
You were nearly chosen
to rule in her stead.

184
00:15:31,416 --> 00:15:35,000
Much of this land still believes
that yours was the better claim.

185
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:39,458
And after Míriel's warmongering,
many are ready to raise it again.

186
00:15:42,416 --> 00:15:45,291
"Many" is hardly enough
to supplant a Queen.

187
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:46,500
Queen-regent.

188
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:49,333
A blind one.

189
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:55,166
What if someone knew a way
to turn "many" into "enough"?

190
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:01,875
In the event that someone did,
why would they not bring it forth?

191
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:06,416
They might be afraid of what could happen.

192
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:15,791
There is nothing to fear
at this table, my child.

193
00:16:25,916 --> 00:16:26,916
Eärien?

194
00:16:29,916 --> 00:16:31,666
Thought that was you.

195
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:33,000
Valandil.

196
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:36,375
You know, I thought Guilds-folk preferred

197
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:38,375
to keep to the more fashionable part
of town.

198
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:40,500
What are you doing in the Old Quarter?

199
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:42,000
-We came here to bury a king.
-Hmm.

200
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:45,625
The Valar rest him and keep him.

201
00:16:45,708 --> 00:16:47,458
I should've liked to have been there.

202
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:49,666
Pity members of the common soldiery
weren't invited.

203
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:53,458
Especially given
the low class of folk that were.

204
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:58,000
Did you just insult my father?

205
00:16:58,083 --> 00:16:59,958
No, I believe I insulted you.

206
00:17:02,416 --> 00:17:05,000
I bled with the Queen on the battlefield.

207
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:09,083
I watched her walk into an inferno
to save lives.

208
00:17:09,833 --> 00:17:12,833
To try and save her brother's life.

209
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:20,166
You speak ill of the Queen again,
it'll be you, suffers an infirmity.

210
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:23,291
Have I made myself plain?

211
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,208
Or need we settle this
through other means?

212
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:37,666
Plain enough for today.

213
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:50,000
Well, I'd say that's worth another ale.

214
00:17:52,708 --> 00:17:55,791
[Pharazôn] What was it
you were about to say, Eärien?

215
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:58,666
[suspenseful music playing]

216
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,875
[Eärien] <i>I found something...</i>

217
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:05,250
[clicking]

218
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:11,166
<i>Something secret.</i>

219
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:21,708
<i>Something dangerous.</i>

220
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:28,083
<i>Something forbidden.</i>

221
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:37,250
[whimpering]

222
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:55,625
[Glüg] The preparations
are nearly complete, Lord-father.

223
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:59,625
But... we are safe here.

224
00:18:59,708 --> 00:19:00,958
[indistinct shouting]

225
00:19:01,041 --> 00:19:02,291
We have a home.

226
00:19:03,416 --> 00:19:05,416
Must we go to war again?

227
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:12,000
You told me Sauron was dead.
Let us leave him that way.

228
00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:17,333
There are some dangers in this world about
which it is a father's burden to know.

229
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:19,416
And a son's burden to trust him.

230
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,041
Trust me, my son,

231
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:24,333
when I tell you
that we will never truly be safe,

232
00:19:24,416 --> 00:19:27,791
until we've made certain
Sauron is no more.

233
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:31,083
As you will it, Lord-father.

234
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:34,333
[Orc] Be off, will ya?

235
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:38,833
[baby Orc crying]

236
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:46,125
[thumping footsteps approaching]

237
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:48,333
[sinister music playing]

238
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:56,125
[growling]

239
00:20:18,541 --> 00:20:23,875
[in Black Speech] Damrod.
Hill-troll of the Ered Mithrin.

240
00:20:23,958 --> 00:20:28,041
-Killer of stone giants.
-[sighs]

241
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:30,916
Eater of Dragon bones.

242
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:33,375
Welcome.

243
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:41,125
[groans]

244
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:46,541
[in English] I gather
you received our message.

245
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:54,083
Where is Sauron?

246
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:59,250
[Damrod growls]

247
00:21:02,791 --> 00:21:05,375
[Celebrimbor] Welcome.
Thank you for making the journey.

248
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:08,791
You need not
hide your troubles here.

249
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:11,000
We have no intention
to take advantage of them,

250
00:21:11,083 --> 00:21:13,458
simply, to, to render aid.

251
00:21:14,166 --> 00:21:16,041
As you once did us.

252
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:19,833
And exactly what aid
do you think you could provide?

253
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:22,875
Rings.

254
00:21:23,708 --> 00:21:26,666
One for each of Middle-earth's
most powerful Dwarf-lords.

255
00:21:27,916 --> 00:21:30,833
You brought us here to barter jewelry?

256
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:32,208
[sighs softly]

257
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:36,541
These Rings will be
beyond any power yet devised

258
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:39,666
by Dwarf, or Man, or Elf.

259
00:21:43,375 --> 00:21:45,666
They shall be Rings of Power.

260
00:21:49,083 --> 00:21:51,166
Power to heal your mountain.

261
00:21:52,708 --> 00:21:55,416
Just as they have healed our Great Tree.

262
00:21:57,791 --> 00:21:58,958
Elrond...

263
00:21:59,708 --> 00:22:01,083
The <i>mithril?</i>

264
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:04,291
<i>Mithril</i> has reversed our fortunes.

265
00:22:05,583 --> 00:22:07,416
I believe it can do the same for yours.

266
00:22:09,125 --> 00:22:11,583
Perhaps, for all the peoples
of Middle-earth.

267
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:17,583
If we provide you with a steady supply,
is that the sum of it?

268
00:22:18,208 --> 00:22:22,541
<i>Mithril,</i> for Rings. Yes.

269
00:22:22,625 --> 00:22:25,083
[Disa] A generous offer, Lord Celebrimbor,

270
00:22:25,166 --> 00:22:27,500
but why not take it to our King?

271
00:22:27,583 --> 00:22:31,416
For Durin the Elder
has always been hesitant

272
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,666
to accept outside aid.

273
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:38,416
But if our proposal
was brought to him instead

274
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,041
by one of his own...

275
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:43,333
My father and I
are no longer on speaking terms.

276
00:22:43,416 --> 00:22:44,250
What Durin means...

277
00:22:44,333 --> 00:22:46,291
You'd sooner convince an Orc

278
00:22:46,375 --> 00:22:49,625
to sit for a sun-bath,
than get the two of us in a room together.

279
00:22:49,708 --> 00:22:52,208
I'm afraid, I'd be of little help.

280
00:22:52,291 --> 00:22:54,416
[Annatar] We summoned you here
to help you.

281
00:22:58,291 --> 00:23:01,125
Bringing your father
a means of saving his kingdom

282
00:23:01,625 --> 00:23:04,041
might be just the way
to earn back his respect.

283
00:23:06,166 --> 00:23:08,000
Perhaps, even your inheritance.

284
00:23:08,083 --> 00:23:11,458
I'm sorry, who exactly are you?

285
00:23:11,541 --> 00:23:13,083
Yes, forgive me. This is...

286
00:23:13,166 --> 00:23:16,333
A friend. To the Elves.

287
00:23:17,166 --> 00:23:19,625
And to the Dwarves. Nothing more.

288
00:23:21,291 --> 00:23:24,416
I see. And where's Elrond?

289
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:27,291
Lindon's restoration
demands his full attention.

290
00:23:27,791 --> 00:23:29,166
Does it now?

291
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,666
I assure you, Herald Elrond
said he could think of little else

292
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:36,791
than helping his Dwarven friends.

293
00:23:36,875 --> 00:23:38,375
He speaks of you so fondly.

294
00:23:39,875 --> 00:23:41,416
Funny.

295
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:45,250
He's never mentioned you. Lord...

296
00:23:45,333 --> 00:23:46,750
Annatar.

297
00:23:47,375 --> 00:23:48,208
Uh-huh.

298
00:23:49,583 --> 00:23:53,041
Elrond said that you were
the wisest of all the Dwarves.

299
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:58,791
Did he speak true, or is there
someone else we should be treating with?

300
00:24:01,791 --> 00:24:04,583
My Lords, you've given us
much to consider.

301
00:24:04,666 --> 00:24:07,958
Might we have a wee moment to,
uh, to mull it over?

302
00:24:08,041 --> 00:24:10,583
-I am afraid we...
-[Celebrimbor] Certainly!

303
00:24:12,541 --> 00:24:14,375
Take whatever time you need.

304
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:22,208
What were you thinking?
Were you trying to pick a fight?

305
00:24:22,291 --> 00:24:24,375
I was thinking, whoever that Annatar is,

306
00:24:24,458 --> 00:24:26,458
he doesn't know Elrond
from a hole in the ground.

307
00:24:26,541 --> 00:24:27,625
How do you know?

308
00:24:27,708 --> 00:24:30,125
'Cause Elrond would never say
such nice things about me.

309
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:33,000
Aren't you in the least bit relieved?

310
00:24:33,083 --> 00:24:34,000
Uh... [sighs]

311
00:24:34,583 --> 00:24:37,916
Yes, but magic rings?

312
00:24:38,875 --> 00:24:41,500
Does no part of this sound strange to you?

313
00:24:41,583 --> 00:24:43,333
That's for your father to decide.

314
00:24:44,375 --> 00:24:47,541
Be hard for him to decide
about a proposal he never hears.

315
00:24:47,625 --> 00:24:49,291
Is that what this is about?

316
00:24:49,916 --> 00:24:51,458
It is, isn't it?

317
00:24:51,541 --> 00:24:54,750
You'd sooner let our entire mountain
roast and rot,

318
00:24:54,833 --> 00:24:56,583
than have to say you were sorry.

319
00:24:56,666 --> 00:25:00,833
You'd sooner feed our family slugworms,
than admit to him that you...

320
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:03,166
I wasn't wrong.

321
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:04,583
[Disa] I agree.

322
00:25:05,666 --> 00:25:07,291
But you're wrong now.

323
00:25:08,458 --> 00:25:11,791
I don't care if they're magic earrings.

324
00:25:11,875 --> 00:25:16,458
If there's even a hope of a solution here,
no matter how farfetched,

325
00:25:16,541 --> 00:25:18,458
our King needs to know about it.

326
00:25:19,333 --> 00:25:24,083
Either you bring news of this
to your father, or I will.

327
00:25:29,416 --> 00:25:31,833
[Celebrimbor] <i>There is a saying,
in Khazad-dûm,</i>

328
00:25:31,916 --> 00:25:34,875
"The slow drip splits the boulder."

329
00:25:37,583 --> 00:25:39,208
So give them time.

330
00:25:41,875 --> 00:25:43,833
And time is a luxury we lack.

331
00:25:45,125 --> 00:25:47,375
Supposing your High King
were to discover...

332
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:52,875
What about the High King?

333
00:25:55,166 --> 00:25:56,750
No, I should not.

334
00:25:57,458 --> 00:26:00,791
No. Say what? Speak plain.

335
00:26:02,291 --> 00:26:06,791
Your High King believes the Dwarves
to be unworthy of this power.

336
00:26:10,375 --> 00:26:14,166
In fact, he has forbidden
the forging of any more Rings at all.

337
00:26:16,916 --> 00:26:19,333
And the truth is he
does not even know I am here.

338
00:26:25,208 --> 00:26:30,375
Well. What business is it of his,
how I conduct myself in my own realm?

339
00:26:30,458 --> 00:26:32,166
-Celebrimbor...
-No!

340
00:26:33,583 --> 00:26:36,125
Countless lives are at risk.

341
00:26:36,208 --> 00:26:40,750
We have not the time to bandy words about,
convincing him who is worthy of aid.

342
00:26:42,375 --> 00:26:45,583
[Annatar] Nevertheless, sooner or later,
Gil-galad will discover the truth.

343

Supposing he doesn't?

344
00:26:52,541 --> 00:26:53,958
[Annatar] What are you doing?

345
00:26:56,750 --> 00:27:02,000
I am congratulating the High King
on the efficacy of The Three

346
00:27:03,166 --> 00:27:06,166
and telling him
that I am closing up the forge.

347
00:27:07,541 --> 00:27:10,541
With a promise to join him in Lindon
as soon as possible.

348
00:27:17,333 --> 00:27:19,083
You would lie to your High King?

349
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,833
I would grant us the space
to complete our work.

350
00:27:27,583 --> 00:27:31,083
I have spent an age preparing for this.

351
00:27:32,041 --> 00:27:33,708
I have apprenticed, I have studied,

352
00:27:33,791 --> 00:27:35,625
I have reached
the very height of my craft.

353
00:27:38,583 --> 00:27:40,708
This... This is my moment.

354
00:27:45,041 --> 00:27:46,875
Now, he will not take it away.

you leave it in.

[Isildur winces]

490
00:42:49,833 --> 00:42:51,958
Did your mother teach you how to do this?

491
00:42:54,750 --> 00:42:56,041
What happened?

492
00:42:57,250 --> 00:42:58,875
What d'you think happened?

493
00:43:00,625 --> 00:43:06,625
[Arondir] I failed. Failed to stop Adar.
Failed... to protect her.

494
00:43:07,833 --> 00:43:10,625
I thought she was getting better.

495
00:43:10,708 --> 00:43:16,125
There is a foulness in Orc arrows
not easily forgotten by human flesh.

496
00:43:23,791 --> 00:43:25,541
Pleases me to see you, Isildur.

497
00:43:26,250 --> 00:43:28,833
So few who slept in the fire
made it this far,

498
00:43:29,666 --> 00:43:31,875
save those who took the Mark of Adar.

499
00:43:34,583 --> 00:43:37,000
I wish I could share my relief
with your father.

502
00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:48,583
Númenor will return.

503
00:43:49,625 --> 00:43:51,750
Your family will be whole again.

504

[indistinct chatter]

506
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,583
This village needs a healer.

507
00:44:11,458 --> 00:44:13,541
Their healer just burned on a pyre.

508
00:44:18,166 --> 00:44:19,750
[Arondir] What do you know of Beleriand?

509
00:44:21,250 --> 00:44:23,125
[Theo] Elf-city, wasn't it?

510
00:44:24,125 --> 00:44:25,958
[Arondir] An entire Elf-realm.

511
00:44:31,083 --> 00:44:32,500
I was born there.

512
00:44:35,250 --> 00:44:37,000
Now, it lies under the wave.

513
00:44:41,583 --> 00:44:45,500
After it fell, I felt such anger.

514
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,416
Toward Morgoth.

515
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:51,041
But I felt the most anger towards myself.

516
00:44:57,958 --> 00:45:02,791
It is a thirst
that can never be slaked, Theo.

517
00:45:03,750 --> 00:45:06,583
And in the end it will drink you dry.

518
00:45:07,375 --> 00:45:10,000
All right, yeah. More can do it
in the same time, yeah.

519
00:45:19,083 --> 00:45:21,083
All those years you were watching us...

520
00:45:22,458 --> 00:45:24,500
d'you ever know my father?

521
00:45:24,583 --> 00:45:27,250
No. I did not.

522
00:45:28,416 --> 00:45:29,750
Neither did I.

523
00:45:31,083 --> 00:45:35,208
But I know this much, he wasn't you.

524
00:45:37,458 --> 00:45:41,083
And anything you were to me, is ashes now.

525
00:45:43,041 --> 00:45:47,166
So for my part,
we don't ever need to speak again.

526
00:45:56,750 --> 00:45:58,541
[female villager] Fetch me
some more of that wood, lad.

527
00:45:58,625 --> 00:46:00,333
Yeah, from that pile there. Yeah.

528
00:46:16,375 --> 00:46:18,041
This is from old Númenor.

529
00:46:18,833 --> 00:46:22,458
Some fountain. Barely spits a drop.

530
00:46:22,541 --> 00:46:26,333
It's not a fountain. It's an aqueduct.

531
00:46:26,416 --> 00:46:28,833
It's supposed to bring water
into your homes.

532
00:46:30,416 --> 00:46:32,500
Men can't build things like that.

533
00:46:33,083 --> 00:46:36,333
In Númenor, we can. You should see it.

534
00:46:37,583 --> 00:46:40,125
If it's so grand, why'd you leave?

535
00:46:41,083 --> 00:46:43,500
Heard there were grander things
in Middle-earth.

536

D'you really want your horse back?

539
00:46:53,833 --> 00:46:55,000
You know where he is?

540
00:46:56,875 --> 00:46:59,833
Meet me here. Tonight. Moonrise.

541
00:47:01,750 --> 00:47:03,208
Bring a sword.

542
00:47:13,541 --> 00:47:15,083
[Isildur] Don't burn yourself.

543
00:47:19,041 --> 00:47:20,875
Any word of your intended?

544
00:47:22,791 --> 00:47:23,791
No.

545
00:47:26,458 --> 00:47:31,458
He'll make it. If he's even
half as strong as you, I'm certain of it.

546
00:47:35,416 --> 00:47:37,708
I'm not so strong as you think.

547
00:47:42,833 --> 00:47:45,833
It's hard, not to blame myself.

548
00:47:47,583 --> 00:47:48,833
What for?

549
00:47:50,166 --> 00:47:51,625
Being alive.

550
00:47:54,416 --> 00:47:59,000
For surviving. When so many others didn't.

551
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,500
I was ten when I lost my mother.

552
00:48:11,250 --> 00:48:13,291
Swam out further than I was supposed to.

553
00:48:16,250 --> 00:48:18,000
Got caught in a riptide.

554
00:48:21,750 --> 00:48:23,333
She drowned.

555
00:48:26,541 --> 00:48:28,166
Saving my life.

556
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,625
After my mum...

557
00:48:38,166 --> 00:48:42,583
[sniffling] I keep wondering
what it's like for her now.

558
00:48:46,291 --> 00:48:48,500
Sometimes, I see mine in dreams.

559
00:48:55,708 --> 00:48:58,125
You seem to have found peace with it.

560
00:48:58,875 --> 00:49:00,041
No.

561
00:49:02,125 --> 00:49:06,625
The truth is, what I just told you,

562
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:10,416
back home, nobody knows.

563
00:49:12,875 --> 00:49:14,708
I just told them she drowned.

564
00:49:19,416 --> 00:49:21,416
Nobody knows it was my fault.

565
00:49:26,625 --> 00:49:28,375
Ever since, I've felt bound.

566
00:49:31,916 --> 00:49:34,625
To try and do something singular.

567
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:36,958
Something special.

568
00:49:41,916 --> 00:49:44,291
To try and find a way
to earn what she did.

569
00:49:50,708 --> 00:49:54,083
I don't know
if you can earn a thing like that.

570
00:49:54,583 --> 00:49:57,916
I think you just have to accept it,
as a gift.

571
00:49:58,541 --> 00:50:01,791
One she gave freely
because you were precious to her.
