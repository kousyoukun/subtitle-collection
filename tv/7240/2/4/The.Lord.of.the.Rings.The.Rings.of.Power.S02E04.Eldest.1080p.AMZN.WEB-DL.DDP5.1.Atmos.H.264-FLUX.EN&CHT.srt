1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:06,830
前情提要

2
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:08,580
我研究了薩道克那本舊書
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I was sifting through Sadoc's old book.

3
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:10,790
毛腳族很久以前就走過這條路了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Harfoots must've journeyed this way a long time ago.

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,330
伊斯塔爾一定會屈服在我手下 不然的話
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}The Istar will surrender to me, because if he doesn't,

5
00:00:16,330 --> 00:00:20,750
我就殺了他稱之爲朋友的半身人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I will slaughter the halflings he calls friends.

6
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:31,540
諾瑞
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Nori!

7
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:33,040
你是要往山脊線去嗎
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Were you headed for the ridgeline?

8
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,410
倖存者會在紮營處等我們
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}The survivors will be waiting for us where we made camp.

9
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:37,660
–還有我父親 –你可能錯過他們了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- My father, too. - I think you may have missed them.

10
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:40,040
–你也在找家人嗎  –我未婚夫
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You hoping to find kin as well? My betrothed.

11
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,830
如果他有你一半堅強 我敢肯定他會撐過來
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}If he's even half as strong as you, I'm certain of it.

12
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:44,790
我沒你想的那麼堅強
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm not so strong as you think.

13
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:47,750
我們之間曾有的關聯 現在也化爲灰燼
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Anything you were to me, is ashes now.

14
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:51,080
我是覺得 我們沒必要再交談了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}So for my part, we don't ever need to speak again.

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,580
你真想找回你的馬
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}D'you really want your horse back?

16
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:58,200
–你知道它在哪  –今晚這裏見
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- You know where he is? - Meet me here. Tonight.

17
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,620
小鬼 你那麼晚在外面幹嘛
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What are you doin' out here in the dark, boy?

18
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,250
有埋伏
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It's an ambush!

19
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:12,370
領主大人 準備工作就快完成了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Preparations are nearly complete, Lord-father.

20
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:14,370
有必要再次開戰嗎
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Must we go to war again?

21
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:16,580
除非確定索隆徹底消失
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We'll never truly be safe,

22
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:19,540
我們永遠不會真正安全
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}until we've made certain Sauron is no more.

23
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:22,200
自從戴上這枚戒指 我能感知
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Since the wearing of this Ring, I have perceived

24
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,200
不可見世界的閃現
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}glimpses of the unseen world...

25
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:28,870
我們送去給凱勒布林博的消息 都沒有迴音
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Our letters to Celebrimbor have all gone unanswered.

26
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:31,000
我擔心索隆已經潛入埃瑞吉安
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I fear Sauron may be in Eregion.

27
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,700
至高王同意我帶一小隊人馬過去
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}The High King has consented to send me and a small party there,

28
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:36,080
確定凱勒布林博和埃瑞吉安很安全
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}to ensure Celebrimbor and his city are safe.

29
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:39,290
埃爾隆德的任務不是加入你的陣容
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Elrond's task is not to join your company.

30
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:40,500
而是領導陣容
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}But to lead it.

31
00:02:56,540 --> 00:03:02,540
{\an8\bord0\fs18\b1}指環王:力量之戒
第二季第四集

32
00:02:56,540 --> 00:03:02,540
{\fs21}本WEB版外掛字幕由  {\c&H9B30FF&}風吹來的那片雲{\c&HFFFFFF&}  雙語合併

33
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:29,620
凱勒布林博還是沒回復...
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Still no word from Celebrimbor...

34
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:33,790
如果走阿克薩橋 不到730公里就能到埃瑞吉安
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}If we take the Axa Bridge, Eregion is just under 150 leagues.

35
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:38,370
我們需要一名弓箭手 兩名劍士 相信你能推薦好人選
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We shall need an archer, two swordsmen. I trust you can recommend a set.

36
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:40,620
相信 我
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Trust? Me?

37
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,410
你確定這樣好嗎 指揮官
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Are you certain that's wise, commander?

38
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:46,870
在至高王的催促下 我同意任命你爲第二指揮官
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}At the High King's urging, I agreed to appointment you as first lieutenant.

39
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:49,790
但如果你認爲有失你的身份 我會另擇他人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}But if you deem that duty beneath you, I will choose another.

40
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:52,330
–是的 –什麼
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Yes. -"Yes" what?

41
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:58,410
是的 我能推薦 一名弓箭手和兩名劍士
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yes, I can recommend an archer and two swordsmen.

42
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:02,830
還要帶誰去 指揮官
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Who else shall we take with us, commander?

43
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,370
閃電
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Lightning?

44
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:03,540
沒有任何世俗力量能辦到
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No earthly force could do this.

45
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:07,080
這是索隆的傑作
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}This is the work of Sauron.

46
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:10,160
坎尼爾 還有哪條路能走
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Camnir. What other paths might we take?

47
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:16,540
要繞過去的話 我們要麼往北
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}To circumvent it, we shall either have to turn due north,

48
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:18,080
多花兩週時間...
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}adding two weeks to our journey...

49
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:19,750
不然呢
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Or?

50
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:24,000
不然往南 穿越圖林戈沙德
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We go south, through the Hills of Tyrn Gorthad.

51
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:28,750
到埃瑞吉安會快很多
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Which will get us to Eregion much faster.

52
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:41,870
那裏有邪惡之物
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}There is evil in those hills.

53
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:48,120
存在久遠 充滿惡意
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Ancient, and filled with malice.

54
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:53,750
索隆故意要我們走那條路 我們必須走另一條
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Sauron means for us to go that way. We must go another.

55
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:56,790
大敵肯定兩條路都監視着
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}The Enemy is doubtless watching both roads.

56
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:04,910
看這坍塌 我們要更快趕到凱勒布林博那兒
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}This collapse makes it more critical than ever to reach Celebrimbor at speed.

57
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:08,200
萬一走進陷阱我們哪都到不了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We won't reach anywhere at speed if we walk into a trap.

58
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,080
往南走
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We go south.

59
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:19,870
指揮官 我得反對
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Commander, I must protest.

60
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:21,950
我聽到你的意見了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Your opinion on the matter has been heard.

61
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:23,200
埃爾隆德
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Elrond.

62
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,250
聽到了 第二指揮官
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Opinion heard, lieutenant.

63
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:32,790
我們往南走
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We go south.

64
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:50,950
我們不會聽從那小玩意的建議 你也一樣
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}This company will not take counsel from that trinket, nor will you.

65
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:56,870
如果不能遵守這些條件 你現在就回林頓去吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}If you cannot abide by those terms, you will leave now and return to Lindon.

66
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,540
–我是很想 –那爲何不走
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- I should like to. - Then why do you not?

67
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:05,200
因爲我不想看到有人送命
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Because I do not wish to see any of this company slain.

68
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,830
包括你
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Including you.

69
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:13,120
諾瑞
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Nori!

70
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:44,000
諾瑞 波比
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Nori! Poppy!

71
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:24,790
不好意思 你有看到兩個半身人嗎
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Pardon me. I don't suppose you've seen a pair of halflings come this way?

72
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:33,540
看來你找到羔羊了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}See you found the goat.

73
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:40,700
我要找的...不是羔羊
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It wasn't... quite what I was searching for.

74
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:43,790
那就是你要找的東西
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Well, there's what you're searchin' for

75
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:46,080
你也找到了 對吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and there's what you find, now, isn't there?

76
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:51,410
歡樂咚 快活咚 敲響叮叮咚
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hey dol, merry dol Ring a dong dillow...

77
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:55,500
白蛉草地飛 蜜蜂柳樹轉
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Sandflies in the grass Bees around the willow

78
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:59,450
你的山丘上方有星星
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}There are some stars above your hill.

79
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:02,500
山丘上方常有星星
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Stars above most 'ills.

80
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,200
我和我朋友在找這些星星
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}But my friends and I were looking for these stars.

81
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,000
我本來希望...
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I had hoped that...

82
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:11,660
抱歉 等一下
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}My apologies, j-just a moment--

83
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:14,870
歌唱那太陽 星星 月亮與輕霧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Of sun, stars Moon and mist

84
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:19,120
雨水與雲天
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Rain and cloudy weather

85
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:42,750
魔杖...當然了...
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}The branch... of course...

86
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,950
一定是
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yes. It must be.

87
00:10:58,750 --> 00:10:59,790
波比
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Poppy!

88
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:02,660
起來
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Get up!

89
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:13,330
–有看到他嗎  –誰
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}D'you see him? - Who?

90
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:17,660
你說咧 我們的朋友 那天殺的異鄉人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Who d'you think? Our friend, the bleedin' Stranger.

91
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:23,250
先別管他在哪 我們在哪
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Never mind where's he, where are we?

92
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,370
諾瑞 快跑
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Nori! Run!

93
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:56,160
我想 應該是甩掉他們了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I think, I think we lost them.

94
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,870
你們哪來的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Where'd you lot come from?

95
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:01,950
我們
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Us?

96
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:05,790
你又是哪來的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Where'd you come from?

97
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:09,660
我的腦袋
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Oh, my head.

98
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,830
–我住這 –毛腳族住這
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Live here. - Harfoots live here?

99
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:15,250
毛腳族是什麼
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What's an Harfoot?

100
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:16,620
你就是...
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Well, you are--

101
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,200
你到底是誰
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Who are you, exactly?

102
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:22,700
我是無名仔
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm Nobody.

103
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:25,790
你不可能是“無名仔”
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Well, you can't be "Nobody."

104
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:27,910
大家都這麼叫我
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Well... That's what everybody calls me.

105
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:30,790
如果大家都叫你無名仔 沒人叫你某某某嗎
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}If everybody calls you Nobody, doesn't anybody call you somebody?

106
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,700
我媽叫我梅里麥克
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Well, my mum calls me Merimac.

107
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,330
我是波比
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm Poppy.

108
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,290
我是諾瑞
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm Nori.

109
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:54,370
你的水從哪弄來的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Where'd you get that water from?

110
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:56,500
–小聲一點 –偷來的 對不對
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Keep your voice down. You stole it, didn't you?

111
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,700
從大傢伙那口井偷來的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You stole it from that well. From the big folk.

112
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,620
–你去哪  –沒有啊
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}But-- Where are you going? Uh, nowhere.

113
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:03,540
帶我們一起去
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Take us with ya.

114
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:06,000
抱歉 村子嚴禁外人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Uh, sorry, no outsiders in the village.

115
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,660
村子 什麼村子
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Village? What village?

116
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:09,750
沒有 沒有村子
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No village! There's no village.

117
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:11,370
給我聽好 無名仔
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Listen here, Nobody.

118
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,290
要麼讓我們跟
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Either we're coming with you

119
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:17,540
不然就告發你 偷水賊
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}or I will turn you in myself this moment, water-thief.

120
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:26,790
你們待會兒會見到阿古 我們的領袖
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You're about to meet The Gund, our dwell-leader.

121
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:30,830
想要她考慮收留你們 要遵守四條規定
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And if you want her to even think about takin' you in, there's four rules.

122
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:33,540
第一 不要直視她的眼睛
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}One, never look her in the eye.

123
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:36,370
第二 永遠距離她三步遠
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}B, always stand three steps back.

124
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:41,250
第四 不管怎樣 千萬不要叫她阿古
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Four, don't, ever, ever, no matter what, call her "The Gund."

125
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:43,950
–瞭解 –瞭解
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Got it. - Got it.

126
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:50,120
規定是三條還四條
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Was that three rules or four?

127
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,700
我沒認真聽
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I wasn't really paying attention.

128
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:08,370
去吧 好好玩
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Off you go, have fun now.

129
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:15,910
快啊 那邊
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Come on. Over there.

130
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,500
那是因爲有陽光照射
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}That's 'cause it's had the sunshine on it.

131
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:28,790
看那裏
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You're there.

132
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:30,830
很好 很新鮮 可以剝皮了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Nice, fresh batch, ready to peel.

133
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:44,660
–大帽子 跟我的一樣  –跟爸的一樣
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Big hat, like mine! Like Dad's!

134
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:51,290
毛腳族住在洞穴裏
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Harfoots, livin' in holes?

135
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:57,040
–感覺怪怪的 –因爲我們不是毛腳族
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}-It doesn't seem natural. -That's 'cause we're not Harfoots.

136
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,330
我們是壯軀族
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We're Stoors.

137
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:02,160
壯軀族
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Stoors?

138
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:06,290
你沒事帶她們來幹嘛 沒有人那麼笨
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What were you thinkin', bringin' 'em here? Nobody's that stupid.

139
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:07,700
她們需要一個藏身處
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}They needed a place to hide.

140
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:10,830
是怎樣 沙漠裏有魔鬼要抓她們
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What, with half the devils in the desert searchin' for them?

141
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:14,250
小鬼 要是禿鷹吞了你腦袋 肯定倒退飛
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Boy, if we put your brains in a vulture, it'd fly backwards.

142
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:15,660
別對他那麼兇
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Be nicer to him.

143
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,950
你是在頂撞我嗎
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Are you talkin' back-sass to me?

144
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:22,620
那是第四條規定
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Oh, that was the fourth rule.

145
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:26,250
給我一個好理由不把你們丟出去
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Give me one good reason why I shouldn't feed you leg, limb, and joint

146
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:28,290
送給那些追殺你們的高德林人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}to those Gaudrim hunting you out there.

147
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:33,700
說啊 我聽聽看
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Go on, plead your case.

148
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:42,080
我淌過河流 越過高山
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I have walked across rivers, and mountains,

149
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:45,410
穿過沙漠 幫助我的朋友尋找他的天命
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and deserts to help my friend find his destiny,

150
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:48,540
他的天命可能左右着 這世界的命運 包括你們...
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}one the fate of the world may well depend on, yours included--

151
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:49,830
我說給我一個好理由
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I said one good reason.

152
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,370
你那個朋友 他是誰
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}This friend of yours, who is he, anyways?

153
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:55,410
–他是個巨人 –巨人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- He's a giant. - A giant?

154
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:57,790
–什麼 像精靈嗎  –比精靈更大尾
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- What, like an Elf? - Bigger than that.

155
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,250
所以他是超大隻精靈
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}So he's a great big Grand-Elf.

156
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,200
他不是精靈
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}He's not an Elf.

157
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:05,120
他是個巫師
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}He's a wizard.

158
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:11,120
這片天空下唯一的巫師
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Well, the only wizard under these skies

159
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:14,660
是黑巫師
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}is the Dark Wizard.

160
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:17,660
我們最不需要的朋友就是他的朋友
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And the last friend we need is a friend of his.

161
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,040
把她們綁起來
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Tie 'em up.

162
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:21,870
什麼鬼 不要
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What? What? No.

163
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:24,870
放開她 黑巫師是什麼
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What? Let her go. What Dark Wizard?

164
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:31,870
伊斯塔爾變得 比我們預期的更加強大
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}The Istar is already much more powerful than we had anticipated.

165
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:37,290
他憑空召喚出沙塵暴 殺了我兩名手下
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}He conjured a sandstorm from thin air that killed two of my men,

166
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:41,120
他現在往北去了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}He makes his way north now.

167
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,580
往...那隱士的方向
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Towards... the hermit.

168
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:48,410
那兩個半身人呢
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And what of the halflings?

169
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:54,330
我們正在沙漠搜索 她們躲不了太久的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We are scouring the desert even now. They will not evade us for long.

170
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,620
我以性命發誓
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I swear my life on it.

171
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:01,620
高德林人 你要不是很笨
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You are either very foolish, Gaudrim,

172
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:05,080
就是很勇敢
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}or very brave.

173
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:11,200
你專心處理那兩個毛腳族
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Let the Harfoots be your sole concern.

174
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:14,370
伊斯塔爾交給我
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I will see to the Istar myself.

175
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:27,200
再放他出來吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Let him out again.

176
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:31,370
你不該醒來的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You should not be wakin'.

177
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:35,830
吃土壤 挖深點
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Eat earth. Dig deep.

178
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:38,660
喝點水
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Drink water, hmm?

179
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:42,160
去睡覺
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Go to sleep.

180
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:52,500
你是誰
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Who... Who are you?

181
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:57,870
好久沒人叫我什麼了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Been awhile since I've been called much of anythin',

182
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,620
以前在柳條河一帶 大家都叫我邦巴迪爾
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}but back in the Withywindle, folk used to call me Bombadil.

183
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,290
湯姆邦巴迪爾
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Tom Bombadil.

184
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:12,040
太陽西沉啦 快要摸黑啦
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Down west sinks the sun Soon you will be gropin'

185
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:15,620
別害羞了 金莓
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Don't be bashful now, Goldberry...

186
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:21,700
夜影來臨時 家門爲你開
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}When the night-shadows fall Then the door will open

187
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:30,120
我已經很努力洗你的髒袍子了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I've done such as I can with your filthy robe.

188
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:35,370
洗洗手 洗洗臉
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Well, clean your hands, wash your face,

189
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:37,120
過來跟我一起烤火吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}then come join me by the fire.

190
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:43,000
外面還有其他人嗎
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Is, uh... Is somebody out there with you?

191
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:46,500
我好像聽到一個女人在唱歌
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I thought I heard a woman singing.

192
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,790
女人 什麼女人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Woman? What woman?

193
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:53,330
這裏沒有其他人在嗎
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Is no one else here with you?

194
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:56,830
你在啊
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You're here.

195
00:18:57,950 --> 00:18:59,580
是吧 不是嗎
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}That is, I think you are. Are you?

196
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:04,290
是吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Uh... Yes?

197
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:26,580
話說 你本來希望 在星星下面找到什麼
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Now, what was it that you were hopin' to find under those stars of yours, huh?

198
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:29,040
不會是老湯姆吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Certainly not old Tom.

199
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:33,160
希望找到我的朋友
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I was hoping to find my friends.

200
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:37,620
星星又懂什麼呢
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Shows what stars know, doesn't it?

201
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:40,620
它們就是新來的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Newcomers, that's what they are.

202
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:41,870
某一年還很暗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}One year, it's dark.

203
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:43,700
下一年 你擡頭看
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}The next, you look up,

204
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:49,500
發現一大片小眼睛往下盯着你看
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}there's a sea of tiny eyes lookin' down at ya, a-watching.

205
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:55,910
它們以爲自己無所不知 但不過就是新來的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Now, they think they know everythin', but newcomers. Hmm?

206
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,580
還嫩得很
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Still newcomers.

207
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:07,330
你到底是什麼人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What are you?

208
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:12,080
你還不知道我名字嗎  那是唯一的答案
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Don't you know my name yet? That's the only answer.

209
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,910
我纔想問你是什麼人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Tell me, who are you,

210
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:18,750
孤身一人 無名無姓
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}alone, yourself, and nameless?

211
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:24,040
不過你年輕 我已經老了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}But you are young, and I am old.

212
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:28,330
我就是個最老之人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Eldest, that's what I am.

213
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:32,250
“最老之人”是什麼意思
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What do you mean, "Eldest"?

214
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,870
就是最老之人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Eldest.

215
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:40,080
記住我的話 朋友
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Mark my words, friend,

216
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:43,370
在河流和樹木出現前 湯姆就在了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Tom was there before the river and the trees.

217
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:47,620
湯姆記得第一滴雨滴和第一顆橡實
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Tom remembers the first raindrop and the first acorn.

218
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:52,290
他看過星空之下沒有恐懼的黑暗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}He knew the dark under the stars when it was fearless.

219
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:59,790
這裏曾一片青蔥翠綠 現在全是沙子
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}This whole place used to be green. Now, it's all sand.

220
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:05,080
我還得親眼目睹纔敢相信
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I had to come see for myself to believe it.

221
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:08,580
連鳥鳴聲都受影響
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Even the birdsong isn't wholly untouched.

222
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:12,500
連外面那棵老鐵木也是
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Even your tree out there. Old Man Ironwood.

223
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,160
我以爲它...
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I thought it--

224
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:18,950
他或許願意借我一根樹枝
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}He... might be able to, lend me a branch.

225
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:21,250
你應該問問他的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Oh, well you should've tried askin' him.

226
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:33,290
放輕鬆 伊爾溫 放輕鬆
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Easy, Iarwain. Easy.

227
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,120
我知道
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I know.

228
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:41,450
這種...魔法 你能教我嗎
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}This... magic. Can you teach it to me?

229
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:47,330
教你 這裏有什麼好學的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Teach you? What's to learn way out 'ere?

230
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:55,410
你能控制樹 控制風和火
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You wield power over trees, over wind and fire.

231
00:21:55,410 --> 00:21:58,200
就好像它們屬於你一樣
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You wield it, as if it belongs to you.

232
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,580
天地萬物都屬於它們自己
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}All things belong each to themselves.

233
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:04,200
就像你屬於你自己
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Just as you belong to yourself.

234
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:09,700
那你能教我該怎麼使用魔杖嗎
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Then, might you teach me how to wield a staff?

235
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:14,330
巫師的魔杖就像名字一樣
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}A wizard's staff is like a name.

236
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:20,370
本來就屬於你 你只要證明自己配得上它
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It's yours to wield already, if you prove yourself worthy of it.

237
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:25,910
你今天證明了你還不夠格
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You showed today that you're not. Yet.

238
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:33,450
你能不能變得夠格 我們很快就會知道
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Whether you can become so, well, we shall soon discover.

239
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:41,330
我在這些星星下要找的不是魔杖
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I was never meant to find a staff under these stars.

240
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:47,000
而是你 對吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I was meant to find you. Wasn't I?

241
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:55,700
什麼聲音
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What is it?

242
00:22:56,870 --> 00:22:58,080
我們有伴了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We're not alone.

243
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:05,540
他們是誰
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Who are they?

244
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:11,500
爲什麼要追殺我和我的朋友
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Why do they hunt me, and my friends?

245
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:17,950
你不是第一個 在我火堆旁吃蜂蜜的伊斯塔爾
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You are not the first Istar who's eaten honey by my fire.

246
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:22,200
很多年前有另一個
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Years ago, there was another.

247
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:24,500
黑巫師
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}The Dark Wizard.

248
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:29,120
他後來怎麼樣了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What became of him?

249
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:34,330
他也曾跟你一樣想掌控魔法
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Once, he sought to control magic, like you.

250
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:39,790
現在他掌控了大部分魯恩
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Now, he controls much of Rh?n.

251
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:43,450
但仍然渴望得到更多
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}But still, he hungers for more.

252
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:48,410
你擔心他的邪惡會蔓延
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You believe his evil will spread?

253
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:53,660
除非有比他更強大的盟友
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Not without an ally far more powerful even than himself.

254
00:23:55,330 --> 00:23:56,660
索隆
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Sauron.

255
00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:02,750
要是這兩團烈火合而爲一
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}If these two flames combine into one,

256
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:08,160
中洲將無盡燃燒 直到灰飛煙滅
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}there will be no end to burnin', till all Middle-earth is ashes.

257
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:14,370
你能阻止嗎
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Can you stop it?

258
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:19,580
老湯姆是個漫遊者 不是戰士
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Old Tom's a wanderer, not a warrior.

259
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:23,750
偉大事蹟要交付命定之人手上
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Great deeds are left to the hands they were placed in.

260
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:31,160
我要趁睡蓮生長之時採摘它們
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And I shall gather lilies, while yet they grow.

261
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,580
你是說...
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You mean...

262
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:38,750
交付我手上
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You mean my hands.

263
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:51,290
我的使命是阻止這場烈火嗎
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Is it my task to stop the fire?

264
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:55,120
我的使命是面對索隆嗎
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Is it my task to face Sauron?

265
00:24:57,910 --> 00:25:02,620
你的使命 是面對他們倆
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Your task... is to face them both.

266
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:34,660
我等着你
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I am waiting for you.

267
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:45,120
這是什麼地方
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What is this place?

268
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,250
圖林戈沙德
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Tyrn Gorthad.

269
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,200
人類稱爲古冢崗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Known to Men as the Barrow-downs.

270
00:25:54,910 --> 00:25:58,910
在遠古時代 這裏是他們的領主和國王安息的地方
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}In ancient days, this was where they laid their lords and kings to rest.

271
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:02,620
這裏沒有安息的氣息
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I feel no rest here.

272
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:06,370
就連樹木也顯得不安
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Even the trees seem ill at ease.

273
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:08,580
不用怕
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Fear not.

274
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:10,830
死人構不成威脅
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Dead Men are no threat.

275
00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:14,410
繼續走
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Keep moving.

276
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:25,040
四體僵冷 刺骨入心
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Cold be hand and heart and bone

277
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:29,000
巖洞長眠寒似冰
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And cold be sleep under stone

278
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:54,700
有一瞬間 我好像聽到...
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}For a moment, I thought I heard...

279
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:56,080
聽到
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Heard?

280
00:26:57,870 --> 00:26:59,000
你聽到什麼
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What did you hear?

281
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:02,160
聽起來像是一首歌
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It was almost like a song.

282
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,660
或是一首歌的回憶
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Or the memory of a song.

283
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:18,950
加拉德瑞爾
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Galadriel.

284
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:29,080
這些護甲出自林頓
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Their barding is from Lindon.

285
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:34,330
至高王派了人去警告凱勒布林博
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}The King sent a dispatch to warn Celebrimbor.

286
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,700
是這人嗎
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}This dispatch?

287
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:42,700
我們要趕快離開這裏
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We must go from this place.

288
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:51,750
–戴莫爾  –抓住我
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Daemor! - Hold on to me.

289
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:53,080
別放手
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Don't let go!

290
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:09,870
四體僵冷 刺骨入心
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Cold old be hand and heart and bone

291
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:13,870
巖洞長眠寒似冰
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And cold be sleep under stone

292
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:17,910
如今墓穴長眠罷
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Never more to wake on stony bed

293
00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:21,790
直到日月隕落不再明
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Never, till the Sun fails and the Moon is dead

294
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,080
黑風吹襲 星辰將晦
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}In the black wind the stars shall die

295
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:37,120
準備迎戰
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Prepare yourselves.

296
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:44,660
他們是什麼東西
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What are they?

297
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:46,700
古冢屍妖
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Barrow-wights.

298
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:01,000
攻擊
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Attack!

299
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:26,750
箭不虛發
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Still your arrows!

300
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,870
我們的武器對他們沒用
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}They're impervious to our weapons.

301
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:44,450
撐住 跟我來
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hold fast. Come with me.

302
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:45,750
你去哪
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Where are you going?

303
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:46,830
–幫我打開 –什麼
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}-Help me open it. -What?

304
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:48,500
快啊
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hurry!

305
00:29:55,870 --> 00:29:57,000
第二指揮官
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Lieutenant!

306
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,120
拿去
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Take it.

307
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:27,450
怎麼會
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}How?

308
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:28,660
根據傳說
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}According to lore,

309
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:32,000
只有埋葬他們的刀劍 才能讓他們安息
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}only the blades with which they were buried will return such creatures to rest.

310
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,450
但這些人已經埋葬千年
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}But the Men buried here have been entombed for over a thousand years.

311
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:37,950
看來有東西喚醒了他們
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I think it is safe to say that something has awoken them.

312
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:39,450
不對
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No.

313
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,500
是有人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Someone.

314
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:45,200
喚醒了邪惡
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Awakening evil.

315
00:30:46,330 --> 00:30:48,700
整個中洲的邪惡
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Across all of Middle-earth.

316
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:52,660
西奧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Theo! Theo!

317
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:59,120
–西奧  –西奧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}-Theo! Theo! Theo! Theo! Theo! - Theo!

318
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
西奧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Theo!

319
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:03,950
西奧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Theo!

320
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,830
–西奧  –西奧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}-Theo! -Theo!

321
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,620
他們把武器都留了下來
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}They left all their weapons.

322
00:31:24,370 --> 00:31:27,330
對野人來說 斧頭比金子還值錢
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}To a Wildman, an axe-head is worth more than gold.

323
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:30,250
沒把武器帶走太奇怪了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Strange, they did not take it with them.

324
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:34,790
大家過來 我們繼續
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Come, all of you. We move on.

325
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:38,450
這邊 來吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}This way. Let's go.

326
00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:43,910
不要折磨自己 努曼諾爾人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Do not torture yourself, Númenórean.

327
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:47,500
西奧經歷過更糟的情況
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Theo has survived far worse.

328
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,370
他會活下來的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}He will weather this.

329
00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:51,660
西奧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Theo!

330
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:57,080
西奧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Theo!

331
00:32:06,410 --> 00:32:07,540
西奧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Theo!

332
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:11,790
那邊的 往這邊
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You there. This way.

333
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,290
突襲他們營地吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I say we raid their camps.

334
00:32:45,290 --> 00:32:47,000
這樣會挑起戰爭
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We'd be starting a war.

335
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,410
已經開戰了 臭海人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We're already at war, Sea-folk.

336
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:54,370
我所看到的 我不認爲是凡人做的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What I saw, I do not believe was done by mortal Men.

337
00:32:54,370 --> 00:32:58,450
他們不是人 是野獸 有必要還會吃人肉
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}They're not Men. They're animals. They'd eat human flesh if they had to.

338
00:32:58,450 --> 00:33:01,370
我們每浪費一分鐘 西奧就多一分危險
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Every minute we waste is another Theo's still out there.

339
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:02,660
我們要繼續找
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We've got to keep searching.

340
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:06,910
可以去伊斯菲爾谷看看 聽說野人在那裏紮營
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We could canvass Eastfield Glen. Whispers are, Wildmen camp there.

341
00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:08,000
好主意
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}That's a good idea.

342
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,700
最好往北看看
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You'd do better to look north.

343
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,290
爲什麼
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Why north?

344
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:19,080
我花了好幾個星期 在這片大地尋找我愛的人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I've spent weeks searching these lands, lookin' for loved ones.

345
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,000
北方那片森林很古老
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}That part of the forest is old.

346
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,370
那裏肯定有野人 甚至更可怕的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Promise you, there are Wildmen there, and worse.

347
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:26,000
有道理
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You might be right.

348
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,160
阿隆迪爾
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Arondir.

349
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:33,620
別浪費大白天了 收集飲水和糧食
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Let's not waste any daylight. Gather water and provisions.

350
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:35,000
動起來
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Let's get a move on.

351
00:33:48,370 --> 00:33:49,370
來吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}There you go.

352
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:58,750
你漏了一個地方
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You missed a spot.

353
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:07,830
謝謝
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Thanks.

354
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:12,040
你們島上應該從來不缺水吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Fancy you never want for water on your island.

355
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:15,750
沒錯 努曼諾爾家家戶戶都有水
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No. In Númenor, we have water in most of our homes.

356
00:34:16,410 --> 00:34:17,910
真想看看
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'd like to see that.

357
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:21,200
你未婚夫肯定也是
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I wager your betrothed would too.

358
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:27,200
該繼續前進了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We ought to keep moving.

359
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,410
等一下
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}In a moment.

360
00:34:28,410 --> 00:34:31,580
艾絲翠 你說你跟野人相處過
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You say you spent time among the Wildmen, Estrid.

361
00:34:32,450 --> 00:34:33,330
多久
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}How much?

362
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:37,120
我沒跟他們相處 我躲起來了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Uh, I wasn't exactly among them. I was hidin'.

363
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:40,830
–他們有傷害你嗎  –阿隆迪爾 你幹嘛...
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Did they ever do you harm? - Arondir, what are you...

364
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:43,370
我問是因爲我發現你脖子上有傷
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I ask because I noticed a wound on your neck.

365
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:45,290
看起來是最近弄傷的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Looks to be recent.

366
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:50,830
那是我自己弄的 我在火邊睡着了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No. That was my fault. I, um... fell asleep by the fire.

367
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:52,910
我應該熄滅的 但那晚太冷了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I should've put it out, but the night was cold.

368
00:34:52,910 --> 00:34:54,080
是我太蠢了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It was foolish of me.

369
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:56,950
我們難免都會做蠢事
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We all do foolish things sometimes.

370
00:34:56,950 --> 00:34:59,750
尤其是在絕望的時刻
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Especially in moments of hopelessness.

371
00:35:10,450 --> 00:35:12,290
艾絲翠 那是什麼
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Estrid, what is this?

372
00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:13,910
自己燒的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Self-burn.

373
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:16,580
野人以此隱藏阿達爾印記
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}The Wildmen do it to hide the Mark of Adar.

374
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:20,200
要不是她跟你進來 在入口處就會逮到她
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We would have caught her at the gate had she not come in with you.

375
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:22,120
你是說她是野人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}She's a Wildman?

376
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,250
她是他們的人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}She's one of them.

377
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:26,580
她會帶我們找到其他野人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And she's going to lead us to all the others.

378
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,160
你本來打算怎樣
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What was your plan?

379
00:35:41,450 --> 00:35:43,950
攻擊我 搶走我的馬
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Stab me? Take my horse?

380
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:47,450
是嗎 不是
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Was that it? No?

381
00:35:47,450 --> 00:35:51,200
後來你發現我是努曼諾爾人 想到更好的主意 對吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Then you saw I was a Númenórean. Had a better idea, didn't you?

382
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:55,290
你一直在利用我
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You were using me all along.

383
00:35:55,950 --> 00:35:57,580
你根本沒未婚夫吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Wager you don't even have a betrothed.

384
00:35:57,580 --> 00:36:00,200
–你寧願我死在魔多  –不知道
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Would you rather I died in Mordor? - I don't know.

385
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:02,500
我想想
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Let me think.

386
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:15,870
那什麼
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What is it?

387
00:36:25,410 --> 00:36:26,620
別動
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Be still.

388
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:34,750
快
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Come quickly.

389
00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:37,540
西奧根本不是被人類抓走
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Theo was not taken by Men at all.

390
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:01,700
看看
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Look.

391
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:04,790
小胖醒了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Well-fed's awake.

392
00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:14,450
救命
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Help!

393
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:21,410
外面那是什麼
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What's out there?

394
00:37:21,410 --> 00:37:25,000
不知道 不管是什麼 一定很大隻
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Don't know yet. But whatever they are, they're big.

395
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,120
小心腳下
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Watch your step.

396
00:37:55,950 --> 00:37:58,950
能用手的話會比較好平衡
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Might be easier to balance if I had use of my hands.

397
00:37:58,950 --> 00:38:00,660
也比較好逃跑
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And easier to escape.

398
00:38:01,950 --> 00:38:04,290
這樣沒人逃得掉
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No one could escape in this.

399
00:38:04,290 --> 00:38:05,580
幫我解開吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Come on, unlock me.

400
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:13,660
我可以
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It's all right.

401
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:17,080
別動
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Be still.

402
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:18,500
我說我可以
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I said it's all right.

403
00:38:23,870 --> 00:38:24,830
手給我
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Give me your hand.

404
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:26,950
救命
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Help!

405
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:35,580
拉我起來
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Lift me up.

406
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:39,250
我要沉下去了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm going down.

407
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:54,540
剛那是什麼
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What was that?

408
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:57,410
世界深處多的是無名之物
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}There are nameless things in the deep places of this world.

409
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:02,040
這一個...
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}This one...

410
00:40:04,250 --> 00:40:06,120
我們稱之爲“晚餐”
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}we shall call "supper."

411
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:18,160
好 我跟村裏的長老商量過了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Right, I've conferred with the village elders.

412
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:23,870
日出時把你們兩個趕出去 抱歉 但壯軀族優先
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You two are to be cast out at sunrise. Sorry, but Stoors must come first.

413
00:40:23,870 --> 00:40:26,950
老實說 換作是他...
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Truth is, he was in your place...

414
00:40:29,450 --> 00:40:31,790
換作是薩道克也會這麼做
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Sadoc likely would've done the same thing.

415
00:40:32,290 --> 00:40:33,660
薩道克
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Sadoc?

416
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:37,290
我們的尋路人 他叫薩道克布羅斯
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Our trail-finder. He was called Sadoc Burrows.

417
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:42,370
你們領袖叫薩道克布羅斯
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Sadoc Burrows was your leader's name?

418
00:40:46,870 --> 00:40:50,700
我不相信你 只是想確認一下
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Just so's we're both working with a full bushel, I don't believe you.

419
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:54,950
我給你看這個只是想充分確認
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm only showin' you this to make good and sure.

420
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:56,870
確認什麼
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Sure of what?

421
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:05,700
相傳在古代有個壯軀族人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Story goes, in ancient days, there was a Stoor.

422
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:07,790
跟我們其他人很不一樣
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Wasn't like the rest of us.

423
00:41:07,790 --> 00:41:13,830
據說有天晚上他夢到一個地方 那裏有一望無際的清涼溪流
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}They say he dreamed one night of a place, with endless streams of cold water

424
00:41:13,830 --> 00:41:18,500
綿延起伏的柔軟山丘 不用一個月
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and rollin' hills so soft, a family could dig a hole

425
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:20,620
一家人就能挖個洞住進去
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and live in it in less than a month.

426
00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:24,700
他稱那裏爲“蘇薩”
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}He called it "the S?zat."

427
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:29,700
有一年他帶着一羣追隨者出發尋找
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Struck out one year with a caravan of followers to find it.

428
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:31,330
承諾等他找到了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Promised, when he did,

429
00:41:31,330 --> 00:41:34,040
會派人回來帶我們大家過去
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}he'd send someone back to gather the rest of us.

430
00:41:35,450 --> 00:41:40,500
那是我們最後一次聽到 羅裏馬斯布羅斯這名字
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}But that was the last any of us ever heard of Rorimas Burrows.

431
00:41:48,790 --> 00:41:50,410
波比的行腳之歌
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Poppy's walkin' song.

432
00:41:51,790 --> 00:41:54,000
毛腳族來過這裏
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Harfoots have been here before.

433
00:41:58,830 --> 00:42:01,290
你的村子 你的家鄉
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Your kind's home, where you come from,

434
00:42:01,290 --> 00:42:02,830
看起來像這樣嗎
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}does it look like this?

435
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:08,000
你們是回來帶我們大家去蘇薩的嗎
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Have you come back here to lead us all to the S?zat?

436
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,290
我想...
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I think, um...

437
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:17,910
羅裏馬斯從未找到蘇薩
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Rorimas never found the S?zat.

438
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:24,040
過了好久
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And after a while...

439
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:30,160
我們一直在流浪
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}we just kept wanderin'.

440
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:41,040
我們沒有家
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We don't have a home.

441
00:42:55,290 --> 00:42:59,080
騎馬人來了 大傢伙 這邊走
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}The riders sighted. Big folk. Comin' this way.

442
00:43:09,790 --> 00:43:11,580
各位大駕光臨...
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}To what do we owe the pleasure of--

443
00:43:33,410 --> 00:43:37,450
毛腳族人 在哪裏
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}The Harfoots, where are they?

444
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:50,200
這片沙漠我們唯一知道的半身人 就只有壯軀族
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}The only halflings we know about in this desert are Stoors.

445
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:55,250
知道我們爲何戴面具嗎
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Do you know why we wear these masks?

446
00:43:56,450 --> 00:44:00,500
敢反抗黑巫師 等他親自過來
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Defy the Dark Wizard and, when we return with him,

447
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:02,950
你們就會知道答案
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}you will find out for yourselves.

448
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:36,000
我知道你認爲這戒指在欺騙我
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I know you believe this Ring is deceiving me.

449
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:39,200
但我相信它在指引我
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}But I believe it is guiding me,

450
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:43,750
跟隨指引可能是我們 通往勝利的唯一道路
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and that following it may be our only path to victory.

451
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,370
萬一勝利的代價變得太大呢
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Is there no point at which the cost of victory becomes too great?

452
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:53,450
還沒到那個地步
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I have yet to reach that point.

453
00:44:53,450 --> 00:44:55,040
你怎麼就不害怕
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}How does that not terrify you?

454
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:59,870
因爲索隆統治世界所帶來的苦難
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Because the suffering of a world ruled by Sauron

455
00:44:59,870 --> 00:45:01,660
更讓我害怕
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}terrifies me more.

456
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:10,450
我一直都能感覺到 但戴上戒指後 我能清楚看到
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I have always felt it. But with this Ring, I can see it.

457
00:45:11,450 --> 00:45:15,290
如果無法完成眼前的任務 我們將失去一切
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Everything we stand to lose if we fail in the task before us.

458
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:23,410
我父親預見了 有一天
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}My father foresaw that, one day,

459
00:45:23,410 --> 00:45:25,790
凱勒布林博的命運會掌握在我手裏
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Celebrimbor's life would be in my hands.

460
00:45:27,830 --> 00:45:31,830
我會選擇我該走的路 拚盡全力加以保護
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I will choose the path I must to give me the best hope of protecting it.

461
00:45:34,870 --> 00:45:38,160
保護最脆弱
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Protecting that which is most fragile,

462
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:45,120
最珍貴的東西是所有精靈的使命
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}most dear, is a task entrusted to all Elves.

463
00:45:50,750 --> 00:45:52,660
這個使命尚未完成
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And one that is not yet complete.

464
00:45:55,200 --> 00:46:00,700
絕對還會有更多痛苦的犧牲
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And I promise you, there will be more painful sacrifices.

465
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:09,040
加拉德瑞爾
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Galadriel?

466
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:12,160
答應我 埃爾隆德
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Promise me, Elrond,

467
00:46:13,950 --> 00:46:17,410
你會把消滅索隆放在第一位
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}you will put opposing Sauron above all other considerations.

468
00:46:18,750 --> 00:46:19,950
甚至優先於我的命
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Even my life.

469
00:46:20,950 --> 00:46:24,370
我不會答應被戒指左右之人任何事
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I will make no promise whose asking is borne of that Ring.

470
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:31,410
但我發誓
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}But I swear to you...

471
00:46:33,370 --> 00:46:35,620
消滅索隆會是第一要務
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}defeating Sauron will come first.

472
00:46:37,330 --> 00:46:38,950
甚至優先於你
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Even before you.

473
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:45,500
指揮官 抱歉打擾 我們聽到鼓聲
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Forgive me, commander, we heard drums.

474
00:47:26,660 --> 00:47:28,330
那是手銬的鑰匙嗎
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Is that the key to the manacles?

475
00:47:29,620 --> 00:47:32,620
他是要讓你決定用不用吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Believe he meant for you to decide whether or not to use it.

476
00:47:54,870 --> 00:47:55,870
我很抱歉
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm sorry.

477
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:00,250
我也是
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}So am I.

478
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:05,910
不 伊熙爾杜 那個...
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No. Isildur, y'see...

479
00:48:10,660 --> 00:48:13,120
像我這種人不會得到原諒
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Forgiveness doesn't come to folk like me.

480
00:48:14,750 --> 00:48:17,160
他們遲早會趕我走 你很清楚
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Sooner or later, they'll cast me out, you know they will.

481
00:48:25,330 --> 00:48:26,620
我不會讓他們這麼做
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I won't let them.

482
00:48:29,250 --> 00:48:30,870
我不會讓他們趕你走
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I won't let them cast you out.

483
00:48:33,620 --> 00:48:35,160
放下劍
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Put down the sword.

484
00:48:49,790 --> 00:48:51,790
艾絲翠 放下劍
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Estrid, drop the sword!

485
00:48:58,250 --> 00:48:59,580
艾絲翠
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Estrid!

486
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:07,370
住手
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Stop!

487
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:15,160
我是大綠林的阿隆迪爾
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I am Arondir, of the Greenwood.

488
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:22,910
你曾拿斧頭砍過樹木嗎
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hast thou ever touched axe to wooded life?

489
00:49:25,330 --> 00:49:27,200
我也很痛苦 但...
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}To my great pain, I have, but--

490
00:49:30,330 --> 00:49:31,540
聽我說
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Listen to me!

491
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:53,620
那不是爲了砍下樹木
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It is not for felling trees.

492
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:00,620
那是爲了什麼
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What does it fell?

493
00:50:00,620 --> 00:50:02,120
奧克
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Orcs.

494
00:50:06,660 --> 00:50:07,870
退後
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Stay back.

495
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:11,290
有一支...
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}There was an...

496
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:14,910
奧克大軍
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}an army of them.

497
00:50:14,910 --> 00:50:19,080
一邊行進 一邊屠殺
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Maiming and murdering as they marched.

498
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:21,580
我們看到他們乾的好事
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We saw what they did.

499
00:50:22,620 --> 00:50:26,200
所以你們纔來這 才這麼生氣
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Is that why you're here? Why you're so angry?

500
00:50:28,290 --> 00:50:34,290
噴濺的樹液和燃燒的樹枝 從遠處呼喚我們
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}The spilling sap and burning branch called to us from afar.

501
00:50:35,830 --> 00:50:39,580
可是...我們來得太遲
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}But... we were too late.

502
00:50:39,580 --> 00:50:42,660
大軍 多久以前的事
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}An army? How long ago was this?

503
00:50:42,660 --> 00:50:46,870
冬花從這些樹還小就滋養他們長大
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Winterbloom nourished many of those trees from seed and sprout.

504
00:50:46,870 --> 00:50:49,830
別要她再多說了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Do not ask her to speak more of it.

505
00:50:49,830 --> 00:50:51,660
他們跟他們沒兩樣
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}They are no different from them!

506
00:50:56,330 --> 00:51:01,120
連根拔起 砍斷樹枝 劈開樹幹 壞事做盡
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Disemboweling, and uprooting, branch-breakers and trunk-splitters, all!

507
00:51:07,410 --> 00:51:08,330
我們應當
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We would seek...

508
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,330
爲造成的傷害
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}your forgiveness...

509
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:27,330
誠摯懇求
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}for the injury...

510
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:37,700
你們的原諒
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}...we have done.

511
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:53,580
原諒需要時間
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Forgiveness takes an age.

512
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:06,290
要等雨水洗去土壤的沉痛記憶
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Rain washing clear the long memory of soil.

513
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:10,870
新鮮樹皮覆蓋陳舊傷疤
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}New bark, covering old scars.

514
00:52:11,660 --> 00:52:15,450
在這段時間裏 我保證
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And in all that time, I promise,

515
00:52:15,450 --> 00:52:19,910
我們會確保這片森林平靜祥和
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}we will see to it that the trees of this wood are left in peace.

516
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:40,080
他們知道什麼意思嗎
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Think they know what peace is?

517
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:44,000
夜晚暴風雨過後
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It is what comes after the night storms,

518
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,950
黎明寧靜 鳥兒甦醒那個片刻
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}when the dawn is silent, and the birds awaken.

519
00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:53,200
在山脈拔地而起
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We have tended this forest

520
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:57,290
切割大地之前 我們就在照料這片森林了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}since before the mountains rose up and divided it.

521
00:53:00,790 --> 00:53:06,620
那時這裏唯一的聲音 只有苔蘚沐浴陽光
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}When the only sound here was the light upon the moss...

522
00:53:11,250 --> 00:53:12,330
西奧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Theo?

523
00:53:12,330 --> 00:53:15,830
和樹葉呼吸起伏
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And the breathing of the leaves.

524
00:53:19,580 --> 00:53:24,500
是的 我們知道平靜祥和什麼意思
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yes. We know peace.

525
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:27,290
艾絲翠 是我
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Estrid? It's me.

526
00:53:36,870 --> 00:53:39,250
艾絲翠
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Estrid? Estrid.

527
00:53:41,250 --> 00:53:42,250
哈根
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hagen?

528
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:46,790
–我以爲... –我也是
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- What... I thought you... - So did I.

529
00:53:50,750 --> 00:53:53,870
不敢相信真的是你 看看你
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I can't believe you're here. Look at you.

530
00:54:20,620 --> 00:54:22,250
謝謝你來救我
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Thank you for coming for me.

531
00:54:26,620 --> 00:54:28,160
我做了承諾
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I made a promise.

532
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:31,120
謝謝你信守承諾
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Thank you for keepin' it.

533
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:37,290
現在我要信守另一個承諾
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Now I must keep another.

534
00:54:38,870 --> 00:54:43,540
奧克不斷前進 我要跟上去
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Orcs are on the move. I must follow the trail where it leads.

535
00:54:44,620 --> 00:54:47,080
說不定有機會再次對上阿達爾
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Perhaps have another chance to confront Adar.

536
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:52,620
要的話你可以跟我一起去
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You can come with me, if you wish.

537
00:54:56,830 --> 00:54:58,660
我有自己的承諾要信守
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I have promises of my own to keep.

538
00:55:06,370 --> 00:55:10,250
那再見了 佩拉基爾領主
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Then mae glenno. Lord of Pelargir.

539
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:24,040
南方

540
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:27,000
埃瑞吉安

541
00:55:48,370 --> 00:55:49,910
奧克
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Orc-treachery.

542
00:55:49,910 --> 00:55:51,410
那條路
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}That trail.

543
00:55:52,790 --> 00:55:54,040
看來是通往...
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I gather it leads to--

544
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:56,160
埃瑞吉安 大人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Eregion, my liege.

545
00:55:57,040 --> 00:56:01,330
我們來找索隆 卻找到阿達爾
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We came in search of Sauron. And instead, we find Adar?

546
00:56:01,830 --> 00:56:03,790
他們是一夥的還是...
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Could they be in league with each other or...

547
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:06,910
可能在戰鬥
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Perhaps at war.

548
00:56:06,910 --> 00:56:09,370
奧克大軍進軍精靈王國
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}A legion of Orcs have marched into Elvish lands.

549
00:56:10,370 --> 00:56:12,080
我們所有人都在戰鬥
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We are all of us at war.

550
00:56:14,870 --> 00:56:18,540
在我們的大軍前往魔多之前 要讓至高王知道這消息
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Word of this must reach the High King before our host sails for Mordor.

551
00:56:23,370 --> 00:56:24,410
那裏
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}There!

552
00:56:28,410 --> 00:56:29,540
等等
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hold!

553
00:56:30,370 --> 00:56:32,330
我們的晚餐跑掉了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}But that's our supper gettin' away!

554
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:35,660
快啊
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Come on!

555
00:56:36,950 --> 00:56:38,450
歸隊
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Back in line!

556
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:44,080
是誰 繼續找
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Who is it? Keep looking.

557
00:56:56,660 --> 00:56:59,500
就在附近 繼續找
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}They're nearby. Keep lookin'.

558
00:57:01,700 --> 00:57:04,000
是誰 那什麼
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Who is it? What was that?

559
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:07,410
這邊傳來的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Came from over here.

560
00:57:08,370 --> 00:57:10,790
我聞到精靈的味道
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I can smell an Elf.

561
00:57:36,450 --> 00:57:37,410
太神奇了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Amazing.

562
00:57:37,410 --> 00:57:39,750
給我徹底找 快
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Leave no stone unturned. Go!

563
00:57:39,750 --> 00:57:43,580
快去林頓 我會盡力拖延他們
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Get to Lindon. I will occupy them as long as I am able.

564
00:57:47,370 --> 00:57:48,450
繼續找
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Keep looking.

565
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:50,450
拿去
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Take it.

566
00:57:55,080 --> 00:57:56,620
埃爾隆德 拿去
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Take it, Elrond.

567
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:00,450
在那裏
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Over there.

568
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:10,000
其他的呢
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Where's the rest?

569
00:58:11,950 --> 00:58:13,120
只有我一個人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I stand alone.

570
00:58:14,370 --> 00:58:16,620
砍下她的右手拇指
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Cut off her right thumb.

571
00:58:17,950 --> 00:58:21,870
快說其他的在哪 就留你左手拇指
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Tell us where the others are, I'll let you keep the left.

572
00:59:11,290 --> 00:59:14,040
她犧牲自己拯救我們大家
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}She sacrificed herself to save us all.

573
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:21,160
你錯了 坎尼爾
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No, you are mistaken, Camnir.

574
00:59:23,700 --> 00:59:26,120
她這麼做不是爲了救我們
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}She did not do it to save us.

575
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:29,450
什麼
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What?

576
00:59:29,450 --> 00:59:31,790
是爲了救戒指
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}She did it to save the ring.

577
00:59:33,870 --> 00:59:34,870
快
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hurry.

578
00:59:41,580 --> 00:59:43,290
這裏是精靈領地
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}These are Elven lands.

579
00:59:47,370 --> 00:59:49,080
滾回魔影去
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Go back to the shadow.

580
01:00:01,330 --> 01:00:04,580
一顆星照耀着我們相遇的時刻
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}A star shines on the hour of our meeting...

581
01:00:04,580 --> 01:00:06,660
加拉德瑞爾夫人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Lady Galadriel.

582
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:15,790
歌聲起
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Now let the song begin

583
01:00:15,790 --> 01:00:19,160
大家一起唱
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Let us sing together

584
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:23,160
歌唱那太陽 星星 月亮與輕霧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Of sun, stars, moon and mist,

585
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:26,870
雨水與雲天
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Rain and cloudy weather

586
01:00:26,870 --> 01:00:30,580
唱那新芽上的陽光
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Light on the budding leaf

587
01:00:30,580 --> 01:00:34,250
羽毛上的露珠
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Dew on the feather

588
01:00:34,250 --> 01:00:37,950
開曠山頭的風
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Wind on the open hill

589
01:00:37,950 --> 01:00:40,700
帚石南的花
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Bells on the heather

590
01:00:40,700 --> 01:00:45,040
身條細如柳
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}O slender as a willow-wand

591
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:48,120
心地比水清
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}O clearer than clear water

592
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:52,750
清流照蘆葦
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}O reed by the living pool

593
01:00:52,750 --> 01:00:55,500
美麗的河之女
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Fair River-daughter

594
01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:59,790
春日復夏日
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}O springtime and summertime

595
01:00:59,790 --> 01:01:03,040
來年春又臨
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And spring again after

596
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:07,500
風吹流泉上
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}O wind on the waterfall

597
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:11,200
笑動萬夜鳴
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And the leaves' laughter

598
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:14,950
老湯姆邦巴迪爾
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Old Tom Bombadil

599
01:01:14,950 --> 01:01:18,580
樂天老夥計
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Is a merry fellow

600
01:01:18,580 --> 01:01:22,250
他身穿外套天藍色
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Bright blue his jacket is

601
01:01:22,250 --> 01:01:25,950
腳蹬黃皮靴
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And his boots are yellow

602
01:01:25,950 --> 01:01:29,660
唱那幽池的蘆葦
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Reeds by the shady pool

603
01:01:29,660 --> 01:01:33,330
水中的睡蓮
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Lilies on the water

604
01:01:33,330 --> 01:01:37,040
就像老湯姆邦巴迪爾
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Old Tom Bombadil

605
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:39,790
與河流的女兒
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And the River-daughter

606
01:01:39,790 --> 01:01:44,080
身條細如柳
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}O slender as a willow-wand

607
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:47,250
心地比水清
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}O clearer than clear water

608
01:01:47,250 --> 01:01:51,790
清流照蘆葦
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}O reed by the living pool

609
01:01:51,790 --> 01:01:54,660
美麗的河之女
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Fair River-daughter

610
01:01:54,660 --> 01:01:58,790
春日復夏日
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}O springtime and summertime

611
01:01:58,790 --> 01:02:02,040
來年春又臨
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And spring again after

612
01:02:02,040 --> 01:02:09,120
風吹流泉上 笑動萬夜鳴
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}O wind on the waterfall And the leaves' laughter
