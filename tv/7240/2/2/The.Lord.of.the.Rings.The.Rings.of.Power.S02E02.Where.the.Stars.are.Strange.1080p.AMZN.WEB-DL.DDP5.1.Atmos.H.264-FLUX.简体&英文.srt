1
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:08,040
前情提要

2
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:10,500
山就像人
A mountain's like a person.

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,000
用适当的方式对它唱歌 它会反射你的歌声
Sing to it properly, it will reflect your song back to you,

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,250
告诉你哪里有矿挖 哪里有路走
showing you where to mine, where to tunnel...

5
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:18,370
哪里最好不要碰
And where to leave the mountain untouched.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:21,950
父王...
Father...

7
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:23,830
比我们想象得还要大量
It's more than we ever imagined.

8
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:26,160
C都林国王 有... C够了
- King Durin, there is a... - Enough!

9
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,410
拿下那个精灵
Seize the Elf.

10
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:30,910
埃尔隆德对我来说亲如兄弟
Elrond is as much a brother to me

11
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:34,250
就好像从同一母亲肚里蹦出来那样
as if he'd been fired in my own mother's womb.

12
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:36,040
你好大的胆子
How dare you!

13
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:38,160
竟然用你母亲的回忆
Invoke your mother's memory

14
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,330
为你背叛族人的行为辩护
to defend your decision to betray your own kind?

15
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:43,620
背叛族人的人是你
It's you that's betrayed our kind!

16
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:46,040
你对不起你头上戴的王冠
You profane the crown you wear!

17
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:51,250
不准碰
Leave it.

18
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:52,750
那不再属于你了
It's not yours anymore.

19
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,450
你们来自黑暗
From shadow you came.

20
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:00,080
我命令你们滚回黑暗里去
To shadow I bid you return!

21
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:07,620
你昨晚又做那个梦了吧
You had that dream again last night, didn't you?

22
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:10,000
在梦里 我看到某种...魔杖
In the dream, there's a kind of... branch.

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,370
在星空下
Under the stars.

24
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,500
看来有人在跟踪我们
It appears we're being followed.

25
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:19,580
我研究了萨道克那本旧书
I was sifting through Sadoc's old book.

26
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:21,540
里面可能藏了什么指示
I think it's some kinda directions.

27
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,580
欢迎光临鲁恩大地
Welcome to the lands of Rh?n.

28
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:25,500
你为什么那个眼神
Why you looking at it like that?

29
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,040
好像你来过的样子
Like you've been here before.

30
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,410
在梦里来过
Only in dreams.

31
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:35,620
告诉我你的名字
Tell me your name.

32
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:37,200
我有很多名字
I have had many names.

33
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:39,540
哈尔布兰德呢
Where is Halbrand?

34
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:42,500
他走了 应该不会回来了
He is gone. And I doubt he will return.

35
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:45,580
要是他回来 我们谁都不能再跟他打交道
And should he ever, none of us are to treat with him again.

36
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:49,830
埃尔隆德刚告诉我你的伙伴 不是他自称的那个人
Elrond just informed me your companion was not who he claimed.

37
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:51,080
他跟我以为的不一样
He is not what I thought.

38
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,660
他是索隆
He is Sauron.

39
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:55,910
把这直接交到凯勒布林博领主手上
It is to be given directly to Lord Celebrimbor.

40
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:00,290
必须让他知道 哈尔布兰德就是索隆
He must be informed that Halbrand is Sauron.

41
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:03,330
大人 抱歉打扰 有位信使到来
Forgive me, my lord, but a messenger has just arrived.

42
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:05,410
要让他进来吗
Do we grant him entry?

43
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:42,790
卡扎督姆

44
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:24,580
鼹鼠尾炖菜...
Mole-tail stew, mole-tail stew...

45
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:26,040
等等
Wait.

46
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,750
C太贵了 C什么
- Too dear. - What?

47
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:30,330
我们又不是穷光蛋
We're not paupers.

48
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:33,290
是你说我们最好勒紧裤带的
You're the one said we'd be wise to tighten our purse strings.

49
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:36,370
还是其实不包括你自己
Or were you not including yourself when you said that?

50
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:44,040
你是嫁给王子
You married a prince.

51
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:47,580
结果现在 跟一个被放逐之人绑在一起
But now you're bound to an outcast.

52
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:54,620
我跟我爱的矮人绑在一起
I'm bound to the Dwarf I love.

53
00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:01,790
给我满坑满谷的火蛋白石 我也不会交出他的心
And I wouldn't trade his heart for a mine full of fire opals.

54
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,450
不过有火蛋白石也挺不赖的
Be nice to have the opals, though.

55
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:12,370
就是啊
Aye. It would.

56
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,080
你有没有试着找你爸谈...
Have you tried to talk to your father--

57
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:19,500
迪莎 你知道他不会答应见我的
Disa, you know he will never agree to see me.

58
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,870
我问的不是这个
That's not what I asked.

59
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,660
为什么是我要去找他
Why should I be the one to ask for an audience?

60
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:25,120
是他自己跟我断绝关系
He disowned me!

61
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:28,120
他就跟石头一样顽固
He's as stubborn as a stone leg.

62
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,450
把砖块掰弯可能还比较简单
You're gonna have better luck tryna bend a brick.

63
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:32,450
你还不如...
You may as well f--

64
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:33,540
迪莎
Disa?

65
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:35,830
做好掩护
Brace yourself.

66
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:40,790
我说做好掩护
I said brace yourselves!

67
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:42,000
迪莎
Disa!

68
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:26,750
都林
Durin.

69
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:29,700
不会吧
No.

70
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:32,660
糟了...
No, no, no, no.

71
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:54,120
{\an8}指环王:力量之戒
第二季第二集

72
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:54,120
本WEB版外挂字幕由  风吹来的那片云  双语合并

73
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:19,120
这片大地将为你们
These lands shall bear you

74
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,750
再次开出甜美花朵
sweet blossoms once more.

75
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,500
亲爱的哥哥
My dear brother.

76
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:45,540
凯勒布林博大人
Lord Celebrimbor.

77
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:49,330
他们没说你来了
They did not tell me you had arrived.

78
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,330
有什么事吗
What news?

79
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:55,620
我那来了一名不速之客
I've had an unexpected visitor.

80
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:00,660
他回来了
He has returned already?

81
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:07,080
加拉德瑞尔...
Galadriel? Galadriel? Galadriel?

82
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:25,080
这不就是你种下的种子吗
Are they not the seeds you planted?

83
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:33,120
穹苍下 精灵众王得其三
Three rings for the Elven-kings under the sky.

84
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:38,370
石殿中 矮人诸侯得其七
Seven for the Dwarf-lords in their halls of stone.

85
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:43,540
尘世间 必死凡人得其九
Nine for mortal men doomed to die.

86
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:58,580
我们应该从北面进攻魔多
We should attack Mordor from the north.

87
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:02,000
从这里切入 在埃瑞德砾苏伊和埃斐尔阿尔能之间
We enter here, between the Ered Lithui and the Ephel Arnen.

88
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:05,410
从东面进攻阿达尔比较明智
It would be wiser to attack Adar from the east.

89
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:08,830
索隆的下落呢
What of the whereabouts of Sauron?

90
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:13,080
谍报表示索隆最后踪迹 是在前往魔多的路上
Our spies indicate that Sauron was last seen traveling into Mordor.

91
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:17,500
我们研判他打算取代阿达尔 夺取他的大军
We believe he intends to supplant Adar and claim his armies.

92
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,370
如果我们动作够快
If we move swiftly,

93
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:22,540
或许可以来个一石二鸟
we may be able to crush two spiders with one boot.

94
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:24,950
北征军指挥官有什么想法
And what says the Commander of the Northern Armies?

95
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:27,120
加拉德瑞尔
Galadriel?

96
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:33,790
我们应该派船沿安都因河而上
Um, we should send ships up the Anduin,

97
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:37,500
从西面进攻魔多
invade Mordor from the west.

98
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:43,950
着手准备吧
See to the preparations.

99
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:54,370
不需要鹰眼
It does not take the eye of an eagle

100
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:57,450
也能看出你心不在焉
to see your thoughts have flown far afield.

101
00:09:57,450 --> 00:09:59,500
你在烦恼什么
What troubles them?

102
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:03,620
索隆可能去过魔多
Sauron may well have traveled to Mordor,

103
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:07,790
但我们无法确定他还在那里
but we cannot be certain that is where he remains.

104
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:11,450
怎么说
What makes you say that?

105
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,160
索隆...
Sauron...

106
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,790
想要的不是什么贫脊荒地
sees himself not as master of a barren waste,

107
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:20,750
而是整个中洲
but of all Middle-earth.

108
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:26,000
他不但要透过征服加以统治
He seeks to rule it not only through conquest,

109
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:31,000
还要所有人民的思想和意志 都臣服于他
but by bending the minds and wills of all its peoples to his own.

110
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:33,330
为此 他需要的不是大军
And for that, he needs not armies...

111
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:36,580
而是戒指
but Rings.

112
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:40,580
没有凯勒布林博 他无法打造它们
And he cannot craft them without Celebrimbor.

113
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:45,660
索隆孤身一人 没有军队或盟友
Sauron is alone, without army or ally.

114
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:49,910
埃瑞吉安有两条河流做防护
Eregion is protected by two rivers

115
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:55,250
长达数公里的矮人砌石幕墙 厚度有三米
with miles of curtain wall of dwarven stone, ten-foot thick.

116
00:10:56,910 --> 00:11:01,620
放心 凯勒布林博和他的工艺秘技
Rest assured, Celebrimbor and the secrets of his craft

117
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:03,410
都很安全
are safe.

118
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:27,700
我要说 有隐蔽的邪恶势力 正在接近凯勒布林博
I tell you, some veiled evil closes in on Celebrimbor.

119
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:32,250
索隆已经开始行动了
Sauron's plan is in motion even now.

120
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:33,950
我知道
I know it.

121
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:36,870
怎么知道的
How?

122
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:42,500
自从戴上这枚戒指 我能感觉...
Since the wearing of this Ring, I have felt...

123
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,370
我能感知...
perceived...

124
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,750
不可见世界的闪现
glimpses of the unseen world...

125
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:54,540
如同梦境一般 不由自主地出现在我清醒的脑海中
as dreams unbidden, coming forth to crowd my waking mind.

126
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,450
你认为戒指激发了你的能力
You believe the Rings have kindled your ability

127
00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:01,410
让你看到尚未发生的事情
to see that which has not yet come to pass?

128
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:05,870
你有被激发吗
Have they kindled yours?

129
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:12,540
我看到山崩地裂
I have seen mountains crumbling.

130
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:18,370
河水干涸 黑色乌云笼罩在白色塔楼上
Waters running dry. And clouds. Black. Gathering over white towers.

131
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:21,290
C派我去埃瑞吉安吧 C加拉德瑞尔...
- Then send me to Eregion. - Galadriel--

132
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:24,620
C如果索隆在那 我会通知... C你不能再面对索隆
- If Sauron is there, I will send word-- - You cannot face Sauron again.

133
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:31,120
据说欺骗者一旦得到一个人的信任
It is said that once the Deceiver obtains a being's trust,

134
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,500
就有能力塑造他们的思想
he gains the ability to sculpt their very thoughts.

135
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:39,200
不但欺骗他们的心灵 更蒙蔽他们的眼耳
To deceive not only their heart and mind, but their eyes and ears.

136
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,700
扭曲他们的认知
To alter their very reality.

137
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,250
你已经被骗过一回
You have already been affected once.

138
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:49,200
没错
Yes.

139
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:52,200
他看透我的心思
He knows my mind.

140
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:55,330
而我也看透他的
And I know his.

141
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:58,540
所以我更要去面对他
Which is why I must face him.

142
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:01,700
只有我能杀了他
Why I alone can slay him.

143
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:04,200
你曾把他当作朋友
You once considered him a friend.

144
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,450
C哈尔布兰德不是... C索隆
- Halbrand was not a-- - Sauron.

145
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,750
你不能单独面对他
You cannot face him alone.

146
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,950
那如果...不是单独呢
Supposing... I was not alone?

147
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:27,410
埃瑞吉安 精灵工匠王国

148
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:43,160
凯勒布林博大人很遗憾通知你 无法让你进去
Lord Celebrimbor regrets to inform you he's unable to grant you entry.

149
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,700
我不能直接跟他谈吗
Mightn't I speak with him directly?

150
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,080
大人在忙
My lord is occupied.

151
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,580
他祝你一路顺风
But he wishes you good fortune on your journey.

152
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,830
你是在叫我走吗
Are you asking me to leave?

153
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,750
埃瑞吉安领主请你离开
The Lord of Eregion is asking you.

154
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,370
我还是在这里等好了
Perhaps I'll just wait here.

155
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:08,370
以免他改变主意
Just in case he changes his mind.

156
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:24,620
他走了吗
Is he gone?

157
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:27,200
没有 他拒绝离开 大人
No. He refuses to leave, my lord.

158
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:32,290
随便他吧
Well, he can refuse all he cares to.

159
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:36,450
加拉德瑞尔走之前 我答应她绝不会再跟他打交道
I promised Lady Galadriel before she left that I would never treat with him again.

160
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:42,120
还有什么事吗
Was there something more?

161
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,370
他好像受伤了 大人
I believe he's injured, my lord.

162
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:46,910
让他去吧
Let him be.

163
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:49,580
他很快就会走了
He'll leave soon enough.

164
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:53,540
林顿的信使随时都会带来消息
Messengers from Lindon should arrive with news any day.

165
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:18,500
卡拉斯加尔 鲁恩西部

166
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:25,700
白蛾带来什么消息
What tidings from the white wings?

167
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:28,290
索隆的阴影日渐加深
Sauron's shadow is deepening.

168
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:33,540
据说他以全新的样貌欺骗他的敌人
It is said he has taken a new form to deceive his enemies.

169
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:34,580
那伊斯塔尔呢
And the Istar?

170
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:41,370
我听到拾盐者和盗巨象者私下耳语
I hear whispers from salt scavengers and m?makil thieves.

171
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:48,370
有个衣衫褴褛的老头 带着两个半身人往东走
Whispers of an old man in rags, traveling east with two halflings.

172
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:50,370
他既茫然又脆弱
He is lost. Vulnerable.

173
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:52,660
但他不会这样太久
But he will not be for long.

174
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:55,910
我们要在他学会 驾驭自己力量之前找到他
We must reach him before he learns to harness his powers.

175
00:18:56,830 --> 00:19:00,660
或许我浪费在你身上的心血
Perhaps, the blood I wasted to bring you before me

176
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:05,410
应该用在更有用的仆人身上
should have been spent on more useful servants.

177
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:12,910
大人
Master.

178
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:15,750
你派出的一名追踪者回来了
One of the trackers you sent out has returned.

179
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,540
找到他了吗
Have you found him?

180
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:23,830
我不只找到他 还知道怎么抓住他
I didn't just find him. I know how to capture him.

181
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:29,540
解除我们肉身的诅咒 我就马上把伊斯塔尔抓来给你
Heal the curse upon our flesh, and I will bring you the Istar in chains.

182
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:35,160
像你这样的凡物凭什么自以为
What makes you think a mortal like yourself

183
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,450
能够打败伊斯塔尔
could defeat an Istar

184
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:41,830
就连我最强大的手下都办不到
when my most powerful acolytes could not?

185
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:47,660
伊斯塔尔一定会屈服在我手下 不然的话
The Istar will surrender to me, because if he doesn't,

186
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:51,660
我就杀了他称之为朋友的半身人
I will slaughter the halflings he calls friends.

187
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:58,040
那陶德里克呢
What about Doderick?

188
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:01,750
陶德里克
Doderick?

189
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:03,500
好啦 安德怀斯
All right, all right. Andwise?

190
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:08,790
这名字很好 只是不是我的名字
It is a fine name. Nevertheless, it is not going to be mine.

191
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,200
我知道了
I know.

192
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,000
佛瑞德加
Fredagard.

193
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:16,830
你还不明白吗
But don't you see?

194
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:20,160
没人能帮你取名字
No one can give you a name.

195
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,830
名字是注定好的
It is yours already.

196
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:25,870
代表了你这个人
It is who you are.

197
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:33,120
当你听到那个名字 你的心会澎湃汹涌
And when you hear it spoken, you feel your heart glow.

198
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:36,000
有天你会听到的
You'll hear it one day.

199
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:39,370
一定会的
I'm sure of it.

200
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:42,290
我们会找出你是什么人
We'll find out who you are.

201
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,000
我就知道
I knew it!

202
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,620
上面说往东北走
Says here if we turn northeast,

203
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:50,120
就能省掉一半路程
we can cut this leg of the journey in half.

204
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,700
往这边 走吧
Over there. Come on!

205
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:10,700
我宁愿避开那条路
My preference would be to avoid the path

206
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,830
第一天就会没水喝
on which we would run out of water the first day

207
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:15,120
第二天就会热死人的路
and die of heat the second.

208
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:18,660
不过可能只有我这么想
But perhaps that is just me?

209
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,700
陶德里克怎么样
How about Doderick?

210
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,790
这名字你说过了
You already said Doderick.

211
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,370
没有吧
No, I didn't.

212
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:33,160
C有 C有
Yes, you did. Yes, you did.

213
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:39,370
这次觅食还顺利吗
Ah, how fares the forager this time?

214
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:43,200
我只找到一只蝎子和一丛仙人掌
All I found was a scorpion and a clump of cactus.

215
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:47,200
蝎子螫了我 我摔了一跤 然后...
The scorpion stung me, I fell over, and, well...

216
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,000
C就找到仙人掌 C就找到仙人掌
- That's how I found the cactus. - That's how you found the cactus.

217
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:56,000
你不能用魔法变出更多水吗
Couldn't you just, I don't know, magic some more water into being?

218
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:02,040
他怕没有魔杖会再次失控
He's afraid he'd lose control again without a gand.

219
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:05,000
那就找一根来啊 这里到处都是树枝
So we find a gand. S'plenty of sticks all over the place.

220
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:07,040
没那么简单 阿波
Don't think it works that way, Pop.

221
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:08,750
安静
Silence.

222
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:11,870
怎么了
What is it?

223
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,910
在风中 有听到吗
On the wind. Can you hear that?

224
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:20,330
C听起来就像... C马蹄声
- Almost sounds like-- - Hooves.

225
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,950
他们还在附近 上马
They're still close. Mount up!

226
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:47,000
他们是什么人
Who were they?

227
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:49,910
不知道
I don't know.

228
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,540
他们在跟踪我们
They're watching our trail.

229
00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:55,580
看来我们最好走别条路
Meaning, we'd be wise to find another.

230
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,330
我们已经这么做了
We already have.

231
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:09,580
不偏离轨道
Nobody goes off-trail.

232
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:13,040
C不特立独行 C不特立独行
- Nobody walks alone. - Nobody walks alone.

233
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:35,830
那场地震后 每座花园都枯萎了
Every garden has withered since the earthquake.

234
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:37,660
不只花园
It's not just the gardens.

235
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:42,040
整个矮人王国 不祥之兆的传言满天飞
Rumors abound of dark omens across all the Dwarven realms.

236
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:47,120
有人说王子让那精灵进来 这座山就被诅咒了
Some say the mountain was cursed when the prince let in that Elf.

237
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,870
你们两个不会是在乱嚼舌根吧
You two wouldn't be trafficking in conjecture, would you?

238
00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:51,410
C没有 C没这回事
- No. - Wouldn't dream of it.

239
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:54,080
很好 因为谣言就像一只高歌鸟儿
Good. 'Cause a rumor's like a songbird.

240
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:58,250
远听可能很动听 近听其实很空虚
May sound filling from afar, but up close, it's an empty feast.

241
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:00,290
所以不是真的
Then it isn't true?

242
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:03,080
可怕的事正在发生
That something terrible is happening?

243
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:07,040
我们会证明并非如此
We're about to prove it isn't.

244
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:20,450
C都林国王 C都林国王
King Durin. King Durin.

245
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:21,830
迪莎
Disa.

246
00:25:23,370 --> 00:25:24,910
纳维 你的报告
Narvi, your report?

247
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:27,330
陛下
Sire.

248
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:31,950
不久之前 有座火山苏醒了
Not long ago, a fire-mountain awoke.

249
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:36,830
虽然远在我国南方
And although it resides far to our south,

250
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:39,620
随之产生的地动山摇
the ground-shakes it produced

251
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:44,200
却沿着大地之骨一路蔓延过来
spread through the bones of the earth all the way here,

252
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,200
摧毁了我们的矿井
collapsing our sun-shafts,

253
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:50,660
随之摧毁了我们种植作物的能力
and with them, our ability to grow crops.

254
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,950
现在 最直接的补救办法
Now, the obvious remedy

255
00:25:56,950 --> 00:25:59,700
就是组建采矿小队修复旧矿井
is to set the dig-teams to work repairing the shafts

256
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:02,250
并挖掘新矿井 只是...
and sinking new ones. However--

257
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:07,200
你找来的石之歌者 都没能找到安全的挖掘路径
Every Stone-singer you've brought here has failed to identify a safe path to dig.

258
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,040
恐怕是的
I'm afraid that's true.

259
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:15,290
陛下允许的话 我们会找到光明
With your approval, sire, we will find the light.

260
00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:16,620
我允许
You have it.

261
00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:25,160
九世纪以来
For nine centuries,

262
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:32,370
石之歌者建立了 我们与岩石之间的神圣联系
the Stone-singers have fostered our sacred connection to this rock.

263
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:38,790
这么多年来 从来没有
And in all those years, not once,

264
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:44,870
岩石从来没有停止供养我们
not once have they ever ceased to provide for us.

265
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:52,910
如今 无论原因是什么
But now, whatever the cause,

266
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:57,500
这份联系断绝了
the bond is broken.

267
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:01,580
黑暗之手已包覆卡扎督姆
The hand of darkness has closed around Khazad-d?m.

268
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:03,540
小心挖掘 采矿大师
Dig carefully, Delve-master.

269
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:20,200
迪莎
Disa.

270
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,290
耽误你一下
A moment?

271
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:34,790
真要我开口问吗
Are you really going to make me ask?

272
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:39,040
你是说你的孙子们吗 他们很好
Do you mean your grandchildren? They're well.

273
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,120
他们很想念玩你的胡子 不过...
They miss tugging your beard, of course, but--

274
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:44,410
没必要把事情弄得更复杂
You needn't make this harder than it already is.

275
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:48,120
妙了 我也一直跟他说同样的话
Funny. I keep saying the same thing to him.

276
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:53,000
都林肯定知道我是在说气话
Surely Durin knows I spoke in anger!

277
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,160
如果我听到的是一种道歉 国王 请对我丈夫说
If that's an apology I hear, King, try saying it to my husband.

278
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,450
为什么是我要道歉
Why should it be me who apologizes?

279
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:01,500
是他自己闯的祸
It was he who caused offense!

280
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:04,120
跟你说 他...
I tell you, he's--

281
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:07,120
就跟爆盆防风草根一样顽固
Stubborn as a root-bound parsnip?

282
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:11,040
又一个你们俩的共同点
One more quality the two of you have in common.

283
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:14,540
你所谓的“顽固”
What you call "stubbornness,"

284
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:18,290
有些矮人称之为“坚毅”
some Dwarves call "strength."

285
00:29:19,370 --> 00:29:24,870
背负如此沉重的怨恨确实需要坚毅
Oh, I imagine it does take strength to carry a grudge so heavy.

286
00:29:26,370 --> 00:29:30,830
紧紧束缚受伤的心灵 以至于几乎无法跳动
To keep your wounded heart so tightly bound, it can barely beat.

287
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,290
对
Aye, it does.

288
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,410
没错
It truly does.

289
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:47,870
难怪我们听不到山的声音
No wonder we can't hear the mountain.

290
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:50,870
国王连自己儿子的悲伤都充耳不闻
Its King is deaf to the sorrow of his own son.

291
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:52,370
放下你的舌斧 迪莎
Still your axe, Disa!

292
00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:55,290
你想展现真正的坚毅吗
You want to show true strength?

293
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:58,040
召唤你的儿子吧
Summon your son to you.

294
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,540
他会回应的
He'll answer.

295
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:07,450
但要等他低头 先等齐拉克齐吉尔山融雪
But leave it to him and the peaks of Zirakzigil will thaw

296
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:09,370
可能还比较快
before this feud of yours will.

297
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,410
还是没阳光
No sunlight yet.

298
00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:20,620
又是死路
Another dead end.

299
00:30:21,410 --> 00:30:25,870
看来要熬整晚了 加油吧
We're gonna have to work all night. Oh, here we go.

300
00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:31,580
长水泡啦 没什么好丢脸的 我也长过
Growing blisters, I see. No shame in it. Even I've had 'em.

301
00:30:32,370 --> 00:30:35,410
C是喔  C对啊 那时我才五岁
Oh, y'have? Aye. When I was five!

302
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,540
皇室贵手嘛
Aye, palace hands.

303
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:40,700
一辈子都泡在珠宝里
Been polishing jewels all his life.

304
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:45,290
放心 王子 只剩13小时
Don't fret, Prince, only 13 hours to go.

305
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:48,540
对啊 搞成这样都是他害的
Aye. It's his fault we're in this mess.

306
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:49,750
还有他老爸
And his father.

307
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:57,950
敢再碰我一下 我就咬断你的手指
Lay a finger on me again, I'll bite it off at the knuckle.

308
00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:22,080
挖矿还顺利吗
How was the mine?

309
00:31:26,450 --> 00:31:27,450
就那样
'Bout the same.

310
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:32,040
小鬼们呢
Where are the weans?

311
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:34,330
他们说不饿 又来了
Said they weren't hungry. Again.

312
00:31:34,790 --> 00:31:36,040
不能怪他们
Well, I can't blame 'em.

313
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:39,120
这黑麦面包吃起来像去年的
This rye tastes like last year's bread.

314
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,790
就是去年的
It is last year's bread.

315
00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:45,080
怎么不买地面的新鲜谷物
Why not trade for fresh grain from the surface?

316
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:47,410
好主意
Splendid idea!

317
00:31:47,410 --> 00:31:51,120
但在黯溪谷 我们能找谁去说服你爸
But who in the Dimrill Dale will we find to convince your father of it?

318
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,700
C别又来了 C我想想喔
- Don't start. - Um... Let me think...

319
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:54,910
我说别又来了
I said don't.

320
00:31:54,910 --> 00:31:57,580
爬下你的骄傲高峰道歉吧
Ah, climb off your high peak and apologize!

321
00:31:57,580 --> 00:32:00,540
C被你搞得消化不良 C很好 听听你的心声吧
- You're giving me indigestion. - Good! Now listen to your guts!

322
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:01,870
有啊
I am!

323
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:05,120
我依然觉得我是对的
And they still say I was right.

324
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:08,540
要不是他把埃尔隆德丢出去自生自灭
If he hadn't have thrown Elrond out to rot,

325
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:10,700
我们就还有够吃五百年的食物
we'd have food enough for 500 years!

326
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:12,870
你以为重点是食物吗
You think this is about food?

327
00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:18,790
我们听不到山的声音了
We can't hear the mountains anymore.

328
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,750
我害怕 都林
I'm afraid, Durin.

329
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:30,830
很害怕
I'm afraid.

330
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:34,910
迪莎 过来
Disa... Come here.

331
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,410
我们是矮人
We're Dwarves.

332
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:45,950
我们会找到出路的
We'll find a way.

333
00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:50,080
一直以来都是如此
We always have.

334
00:32:51,370 --> 00:32:52,540
怎么找
How?

335
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:21,330
我们送去给凯勒布林博的消息 都没有回音
Our letters to Celebrimbor have all gone unanswered.

336
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:23,450
我担心索隆已经潜入埃瑞吉安
I fear Sauron may be in Eregion.

337
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:27,750
至高王同意我带一小队人马过去
The High King has consented to send me and a small party there,

338
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:30,790
确定凯勒布林博和埃瑞吉安很安全
to ensure Celebrimbor and his city are safe.

339
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:34,700
我来请你加入我们
I'm asking you to join us.

340
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:40,250
就像你最爱提醒我的 加拉德瑞尔
As you are so fond of reminding me, Galadriel,

341
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,410
我不过是个政客
I am but a politician.

342
00:33:43,410 --> 00:33:45,750
所以至高王信任你
And as such, you have the High King's trust.

343
00:33:47,370 --> 00:33:48,830
他相信你够坚定
He believes in your steadfastness.

344
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:52,410
狗也很坚定 拴上狗链就好
A dog is steadfast. And quicker to follow on a leash.

345
00:33:59,410 --> 00:34:01,250
他不让我单独去
He refuses to send me without you.

346
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:05,000
为什么呢
And why is that?

347
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:08,160
C你知道原因 C我在问你知不知道
- You know the reason. - I'm asking if you know it.

348
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:15,080
至高王认为 如果我单独面对大敌
The High King believes, that if I were to face the Enemy alone,

349
00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:18,040
可能容易受骗
I may be vulnerable to deception.

350
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:20,000
他为什么会这么想呢
And why would he think that?

351
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,040
够了 埃尔隆德
Stop it, Elrond.

352
00:34:23,370 --> 00:34:25,290
你违抗过至高王的命令
You've defied the High King's orders before.

353
00:34:25,290 --> 00:34:26,870
现在怎么不违抗了呢
Why not do so now?

354
00:34:28,450 --> 00:34:29,790
因为他是对的
Because he is right.

355
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,370
索隆利用了我
Sauron used me.

356
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:37,040
我像把竖琴受他操弄 弹奏着不由我选择的旋律
And under his hand, I was played like a harp to a melody not of my choosing.

357
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:40,910
一切都是你的选择
It was entirely of your choosing.

358
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,870
索隆看透你的心思
Sauron looked inside you,

359
00:34:44,870 --> 00:34:48,000
拨弄着你的灵魂心声 一步一步
plucked the very song of your soul, note by note,

360
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,370
把自己塑造成你需要的样貌
making himself out to be exactly what you needed.

361
00:34:51,370 --> 00:34:53,450
“失落的国王” 驾驭着你迈向胜利
"The Lost King" who could ride you to victory.

362
00:34:53,450 --> 00:34:56,250
你双手奉上他想要的一切 还为此感谢他
You gave him everything he wanted and then thanked him for it.

363
00:34:56,250 --> 00:34:58,250
现在他用同样的手法 迷惑吉尔加拉德
And now he has done the same to Gil-galad.

364
00:34:58,250 --> 00:34:59,790
迷惑林顿的每个精灵
And to every Elf in Lindon.

365
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:04,290
所以我们需要你 带领我们穿越迷宫
And that is why we need you. Help us navigate this labyrinth.

366
00:35:04,290 --> 00:35:06,040
根本无法穿越
There is no navigating it.

367
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:08,040
那是他打造的迷宫
The labyrinth is his.

368
00:35:09,410 --> 00:35:11,950
一旦深陷其中 就已迷失方向
As long as you stay in it, you've already lost.

369
00:35:13,330 --> 00:35:16,620
C他可能就希望你去埃瑞吉安... C埃尔隆德 拜托
- He may well want you in Eregion-- - Please, Elrond.

370
00:35:18,830 --> 00:35:20,790
我不能让他再潜入我的心
I cannot let him in again.

371
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:23,870
绝对不能
I cannot.

372
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:48,500
他从未离开 加拉德瑞尔
He never left, Galadriel.

373
00:35:50,410 --> 00:35:52,750
选择戴上那三戒
In choosing to wear those Rings,

374
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:56,580
你们已选择成为他的盟友
you have all chosen to become his collaborators.

375
00:35:58,290 --> 00:36:00,080
我不会加入你们
I will have no part in it.

376
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:03,200
你向我保证过
You promised me once,

377
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:08,450
“只要有一点迹象显示” 我担心的威胁确实存在
"If but a whisper of a rumor" of what I feared proved true,

378
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:11,830
你一定追杀到底
you would not rest until it was put right.

379
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:16,830
如果我们的友谊对你还有意义
If our friendship ever meant anything to you,

380
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:20,700
请离开吧
please leave.

381
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:50,870
你不想沉浸在美之中吗
Do you not wish to live in beauty?

382
00:36:51,950 --> 00:36:54,790
奇尔丹大人 我无法相信这三戒
Master Círdan, I cannot trust these Rings.

383
00:36:54,790 --> 00:36:57,580
如果美在某种程度上源于邪恶 美是什么
What is beauty, when it is born, in part, of evil?

384
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,540
不减其美
No less beautiful.

385
00:37:01,410 --> 00:37:02,580
对我来说不是
Not to me.

386
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:05,410
你会因为儒米尔是个酒鬼
Would you cast Rúmil's verses into the flame,

387
00:37:05,410 --> 00:37:07,160
就把他的诗歌丢进火里吗
because the poet was a drunkard?

388
00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:14,620
儒米尔是个酒鬼
Rúmil was a drunkard?

389
00:37:16,910 --> 00:37:19,540
千万别问戴隆
Do not ask of Daeron.

390
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:21,790
他受不了
Insufferable.

391
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,790
但他的声音
But a voice,

392
00:37:24,790 --> 00:37:29,750
能让太阳都留下热泪
a voice that could make the very sun weep tears of fire.

393
00:37:32,870 --> 00:37:34,370
评断作品本身吧
Judge the work,

394
00:37:36,370 --> 00:37:38,870
至于打造作品的作者
and leave judgment concerning those who wrought it

395
00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:41,830
就留给全知全能的造物主去评断
to the judge who sees all things.

396
00:37:41,830 --> 00:37:43,790
感觉不可能做到
That feels impossible.

397
00:37:45,950 --> 00:37:47,450
这就是所谓的谦卑
It is called humility.

398
00:37:47,450 --> 00:37:49,790
对多数人来说都很难做到
And it is difficult for most.

399
00:37:49,790 --> 00:37:52,250
但却是感知事物最真切的方式
But it is the truest form of sight.

400
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:07,120
真希望我跟你一样冷静
I wish I could know your peace.

401
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:10,790
你可以的
You can.

402
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:20,950
我们还没完全了解这三戒
We do not yet fully understand these Rings.

403
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:24,870
但看看它们 对各种生命形式施加的力量
But look at the power they exert over every form of life.

404
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:35,830
要是落入索隆手中 可能产生难以估量的邪恶力量
In Sauron's hands, they could work an evil beyond reckoning,

405
00:38:35,830 --> 00:38:38,750
支配万物的思想和意志
dominating the minds and wills of all.

406
00:38:39,290 --> 00:38:43,160
所以更要交由精灵保管
This is why they must remain in the hands of Elves.

407
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:49,450
你敬畏这种力量相当明智 埃尔隆德
You are wise to fear this power, Elrond.

408
00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:56,870
但别让恐惧蒙蔽了你的判断 忽略了它也能用来做好事
But do not let that fear blind you to the ways it can be used for good.

409
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:02,000
背负这三戒的不是你的敌人
For it is not your enemy, that bears these Rings...

410
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:08,080
而是你最信赖的朋友
But your most trusted friends.

411
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:12,700
如果你认为他们迷失方向 更不该抛弃他们
If you believe they have strayed, do not abandon them,

412
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:17,870
而是要张大锐眼引导他们
but rather open your eyes and guide them...

413
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:22,200
趁着黑暗尚未蔓延到整个中洲
Before the darkness spreads across Middle-earth,

414
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:24,620
蒙蔽我们大家
and blinds us all.

415
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:58,910
你需要休息
You need to rest.

416
00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:03,290
不行 我...
Certainly not, I...

417
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:11,160
醒醒
Wake up!

418
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:17,410
你干嘛 快回来
What are you doin'? Get back here!

419
00:40:17,410 --> 00:40:19,500
我看到了 真的 快来
I saw it. I know I saw it. C'mon.

420
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,290
波比 他没呼吸了
Poppy, he's not breathin' anymore!

421
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:25,830
没错 诺瑞 我看到了
There! Yes! Nori, I can see it!

422
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:27,950
看到什么
See what?

423
00:40:27,950 --> 00:40:29,580
水
Water.

424
00:40:31,450 --> 00:40:35,370
这么久没吃东西
How could someone who hasn't eaten in so long

425
00:40:35,370 --> 00:40:37,750
怎么还这么重
still weigh so much?

426
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,450
快点
Quick sticks!

427
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,410
拜托...
Please, oh, please, oh, please.

428
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,290
波比 快点
Hurry, Poppy!

429
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:05,700
快啊
Come on!

430
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:16,580
有了
I got it.

431
00:41:26,290 --> 00:41:27,540
快啊
Come on.

432
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:32,330
快啊
Come on.

433
00:41:33,910 --> 00:41:35,410
你会没事的
You're going to be all right.

434
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:42,080
太好了 你还活着
Great goats, you're alive.

435
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:44,910
我还以为我们要失去你了
For a moment there, I thought we'd lost... we'd lost you.

436
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,580
我们不会失去彼此的
We're none of us, going to lose each other.

437
00:41:57,870 --> 00:42:00,200
要不是眼睛太干 我一定大哭
I'd be crying 'cept my eyes are too dry.

438
00:42:29,830 --> 00:42:30,870
那是什么
What is it?

439
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:34,000
不会是...
You don't think...

440
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:39,040
跟我在梦里看见的那根魔杖好像
It is not dissimilar from the staff I saw in my dream.

441
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,160
诺瑞...
Um, Nori...

442
00:43:05,790 --> 00:43:07,700
我们只是在喝水
Oh, we were just having a drink of water.

443
00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:24,910
你干嘛
What are you doin'?

444
00:43:24,910 --> 00:43:25,870
诺瑞 趴下
Nori, get down!

445
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:20,500
停下来 快停下来
Stop! Stop! Make it stop!

446
00:44:26,450 --> 00:44:28,290
他干嘛不停下来
Why isn't he stopping it?

447
00:44:28,910 --> 00:44:30,290
他没办法
He can't!

448
00:44:39,250 --> 00:44:40,410
救命
Help us!

449
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:43,500
诺瑞
Nori!

450
00:44:45,950 --> 00:44:47,700
我来了
I'm coming!

451
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:57,450
撑住啊...
Hold on! Hold on!

452
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,200
诺瑞
Nori!

453
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:08,750
诺瑞
Nori!

454
00:45:20,660 --> 00:45:22,080
不见了
It's gone.

455
00:45:24,830 --> 00:45:26,080
是吧
Has it?

456
00:45:39,870 --> 00:45:41,750
我称之为伊希尔丁
I have called it ithildin.

457
00:45:41,750 --> 00:45:44,370
用我们最后一块秘银制成
Made from our last sliver of mithril.

458
00:45:44,370 --> 00:45:48,200
没有月光照射 根本就看不见
Out of the moonlight, it is all but invisible.

459
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:50,120
没错
It is.

460
00:45:51,910 --> 00:45:53,120
完全看不见
Quite invisible.

461
00:45:59,750 --> 00:46:02,370
那位访客 他还...
Our visitor, is he still...

462
00:46:03,790 --> 00:46:05,950
夜晚很冷 大人
The night is cold, my lord.

463
00:46:06,830 --> 00:46:09,000
要我拿条披肩给他吗
Shall I bring him a shawl?

464
00:47:07,790 --> 00:47:10,870
不管你所为何来
Whatever the reason for your presence here,

465
00:47:12,870 --> 00:47:16,250
如果你不自行离开 将遭到强行驱离
if you do not leave willingly, you shall be removed by force.

466
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:19,830
我无法再容忍你了
I can treat with you no longer.

467
00:47:23,330 --> 00:47:24,750
她就说你会这么说
She said you'd say that.

468
00:47:29,370 --> 00:47:32,580
加拉德瑞尔 你跟她谈过
Galadriel? You have spoken with her?

469
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:35,120
你没有吗
Well, haven't you?

470
00:47:35,660 --> 00:47:36,580
没有
I have not.

471
00:47:37,750 --> 00:47:39,500
自从她去林顿就没有
Not since she left for Lindon.

472
00:47:40,410 --> 00:47:42,500
所以你不知道后来怎样了
Then you know nothing of what's happened?

473
00:47:43,870 --> 00:47:45,160
不知道三戒的事
Nothing of the Rings?

474
00:47:48,370 --> 00:47:49,750
三戒怎样了
What of the Rings?

475
00:47:51,830 --> 00:47:52,830
成功了吗
Have they worked?

476
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:56,750
你还是去问她吧
You'd do better to ask her.

477
00:47:57,250 --> 00:47:58,410
她不在这里
She's not here.

478
00:47:59,540 --> 00:48:00,410
但你在
You are.

479
00:48:00,410 --> 00:48:02,040
那至高王呢
What about the High King?

480
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:04,910
他肯定不会忘了派人传话...
Surely he wouldn't neglect to send word of--

481
00:48:06,950 --> 00:48:08,250
这样啊
Oh, I see.

482
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:13,370
老生常谈了 对吧
It's the oldest tale there is, isn't it?

483
00:48:16,370 --> 00:48:19,660
真正出力的人呕心沥血 劳心劳力
The true creators toil till their knuckles bleed

484
00:48:20,830 --> 00:48:24,750
他们半路杀出 坐享其成
and then they come along, take whatever profits them most,

485
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:27,450
把我们忘得一干二净
and forget all about us.

486
00:48:30,660 --> 00:48:32,410
我佩服你的耐性
I applaud your patience.

487
00:48:34,540 --> 00:48:36,080
你要去哪
Where are you going?

488
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:38,500
此处不留爷 自有留爷处
There's no cause to stay where I'm not wanted.

489
00:48:40,790 --> 00:48:41,790
等等
Wait.

490
00:48:55,450 --> 00:48:57,580
哈尔布兰德 拜托告诉我
Halbrand. Please. Tell me.

491
00:48:58,910 --> 00:49:02,830
那三戒 成功了吗
The Rings. Did they work?

492
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:13,290
大成功
They worked wonders.

493
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:18,620
那精灵...
Then, the Elves--

494
00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:19,700
对
Yes.

495
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:26,910
那么 林顿
And, uh, Lindon?

496
00:49:26,910 --> 00:49:28,000
对
Yes.

497
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:36,950
C你在哭吗  C没有
- Are you weeping? - No.

498
00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:44,200
我在享受这一刻
I am reveling.

499
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:49,080
你完全无法体会...
You have not the slightest inkling...

500
00:49:51,790 --> 00:49:53,290
这是什么感觉
how this feels.

501
00:49:53,290 --> 00:49:55,700
这么长久以来 历经了数百年
After all this time, after so many centuries,

502
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:58,370
终于打造出的作品
to finally create something.

503
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:02,870
我要开瓶第一纪元陈年好酒
I'm going to open a First Age bottle.

504
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:08,290
我一直舍不得喝
I have been saving it.

505
00:50:13,870 --> 00:50:15,120
凯勒布林博
Celebrimbor...

506
00:50:21,620 --> 00:50:22,950
你是我的朋友吗
Are you my friend?

507
00:50:24,910 --> 00:50:26,250
当然了
Yes, of course.

508
00:50:27,790 --> 00:50:28,830
怎么这么问
Why?

509
00:50:28,830 --> 00:50:30,790
因为像你我这样
Because there is no place for half-truths

510
00:50:30,790 --> 00:50:33,790
合作无间的关系 容不得半点虚假
between those who've worked so close as you and I.

511
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:40,950
还有很多事你不知道
And yet there is much you do not know.

512
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:43,660
我有很多话想跟你说
Much I want to tell you.

513
00:50:45,450 --> 00:50:46,450
只是...
Only...

514
00:50:49,290 --> 00:50:50,750
你害怕
You're afraid.

515
00:50:52,450 --> 00:50:55,330
看吧 我什么都瞒不过你
You see? I've never been able to hide anything from you.

516
00:50:56,950 --> 00:50:58,120
这样啊
Well...

517
00:51:02,750 --> 00:51:04,080
放心吧
Be at ease.

518
00:51:07,330 --> 00:51:10,580
不管你想说什么 我都会敞开心胸倾听
Whatever it is you wish to say to me, I shall receive it with an open heart.

519
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:15,370
我不是来庆祝精灵三戒的
I did not come here to toast the Elven Rings.

520
00:51:17,290 --> 00:51:21,040
而是来恳求你为人类打造戒指
But to plead with you to make Rings for Men.

521
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:23,830
为人类打造戒指
Rings for Men?

522
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:26,200
你拯救了精灵族
You saved the Elves.

523
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:29,290
精灵族不是人类
Elves are not Men.

524
00:51:30,910 --> 00:51:31,870
人类本性贪婪
Men are covetous.

525
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:36,950
腐化的风险太大了
The risks of, of corruption are far greater.

526
00:51:37,620 --> 00:51:39,290
就算我愿意打造更多戒指
Even if I did wish to forge more Rings,

527
00:51:39,290 --> 00:51:41,200
矮人也不会愿意提供秘银
the Dwarves would never provide the mithril.

528
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:43,910
你会发现矮人自己正面临困境
I think you'll find the Dwarves facing a dilemma all their own.

529
00:51:43,910 --> 00:51:46,120
什么困境  哈尔布兰德 你在说什么
What dilemma? What are you talking about, Halbrand?

530
00:51:48,620 --> 00:51:50,620
我的名字不是哈尔布兰德
My name is not Halbrand.

531
00:51:52,370 --> 00:51:53,290
什么
What?

532
00:51:53,290 --> 00:51:56,000
加拉德瑞尔发现真相后 把我赶了出来
When Galadriel discovered the truth, she cast me out.

533
00:51:57,250 --> 00:51:59,410
我怕你也会有一样的反应
And I dare not risk the same happening with you.

534
00:52:03,250 --> 00:52:06,160
这么说...你不是国王了
I... I take it then you are not a King.

535
00:52:06,950 --> 00:52:09,500
对 不是
No. Not a King.

536
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:12,500
不是南方人
Not a Southlander.

537
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:16,040
甚至不是...凡人
Not even a... mortal.

538
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,000
你是什么东西
What are you?

539
00:52:22,450 --> 00:52:28,080
凯勒布林博 这世上有种力量超越邪恶
There are forces in this world beyond evil, Celebrimbor.

540
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:32,370
有时他们会提供援助
And sometimes, they send aid,

541
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:34,790
以使者的样貌出现
in the form of an envoy.

542
00:52:34,790 --> 00:52:40,540
派遣使者为智者带来指引
A... A messenger, sent to bring guidance to the ears of the wise.

543
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:46,700
什么样的指引
What sort of guidance?

544
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:50,330
魔多的崛起只是一个开始
Mordor's rise was but the beginning.

545
00:52:50,330 --> 00:52:53,750
此时此刻整个中洲正岌岌可危
At this very moment, all Middle-earth balances on the brink of the abyss.

546
00:52:54,450 --> 00:52:56,790
很快所有王国都将沦陷
Soon, every realm will fall.

547
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:02,500
不只精灵 还有矮人和人类
Not just Elves, but Dwarves. And Men.

548
00:53:04,540 --> 00:53:06,290
黑暗势力日渐强大
The darkness is growing stronger.

549
00:53:07,330 --> 00:53:10,580
力量之戒是我们重返光明的最后机会
And the Rings of Power are our last hope of restoring the light.

550
00:53:13,790 --> 00:53:15,250
你我还有使命要完成
You and I have work to do.

551
00:53:21,620 --> 00:53:24,370
你不能期望我相信
You cannot expect me to believe

552
00:53:24,370 --> 00:53:28,500
你是维拉派来的使者...
that you are a, a messenger from the Valar sent to--

553
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:39,910
哈尔布兰德
Halbrand?

554

哈尔布兰德

556
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:34,580
我穿越遥远国度的尘土大漠
I have walked through the dust and the deserts of far-away lands,

待我们的作品完成

世人将不再仅视你为费艾诺的后代
never again will the world overlook you as the mere scion of F?anor

563
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:08,330

我该怎么称呼你
What am I to call you?

570
00:55:58,500 --> 00:55:59,660
我是你的伙伴
I am your partner.

571
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:04,950
如此而已
No more, no less.

576
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:39,580
你召唤我

577
00:56:40,410 --> 00:56:42,120
指挥官 给你新命令
You have new orders, Commander.

578

天一亮你就带着五名 最勇敢的精灵前往埃瑞吉安
You depart for Eregion at first light, with five of our bravest Elves.

579
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:49,700
我...
I...

580
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:54,540
谢谢你重新考虑
Thank you for reconsidering.

581
00:56:54,540 --> 00:56:56,700
你该谢的不是我
It is not I, you ought to thank.

583
00:57:05,250 --> 00:57:08,450
真心感谢你决定加入我的阵容

584
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:13,700
你恐怕误会了 加拉德瑞尔

00:57:14,870 --> 00:57:17,790
埃尔隆德的任务不是加入你的阵容
Elrond's task is not to join your company.

586
00:57:18,540 --> 00:57:20,200
而是领导阵容
But to lead it.

587
00:57:58,450 --> 00:58:00,950
怎么样 是埃尔隆德吗
What is it? Is it Elrond?

588
00:58:01,910 --> 00:58:04,700
这是某种邀请...
It's some sort of invitation...

589
00:58:06,250 --> 00:58:08,910
来自凯勒布林博大人
