Seven for the Dwarf-lords

00:08:56,583 --> 00:08:59,083
[commander of the West]
We should attack Mordor from the north.

117
00:08:59,166 --> 00:09:02,000
We enter here, between the Ered Lithui
and the Ephel Arnen.

118
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:05,416
[commander of the East] It would be wiser
to attack Adar from the east.

119
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:08,833
What of the whereabouts of Sauron?

120
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:13,083
Our spies indicate that Sauron
was last seen traveling into Mordor.

121
00:09:13,916 --> 00:09:17,500
We believe he intends to supplant Adar
and claim his armies.

122
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:19,375
If we move swiftly,

123
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:22,541
we may be able
to crush two spiders with one boot.

Um, we should send ships up the Anduin,

128
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:37,500
invade Mordor from the west.

129
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:43,958
See to the preparations.

130
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:54,375
It does not take the eye of an eagle

131
00:09:54,458 --> 00:09:57,458
to see your thoughts
have flown far afield.

132
00:09:57,541 --> 00:09:59,500
What troubles them?

133
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:03,625
Sauron may well have traveled to Mordor,

134
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:07,791
but we cannot be certain
that is where he remains.

135
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:11,458
What makes you say that?

136
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:13,166
Sauron...

137
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,791
sees himself
not as master of a barren waste,

138
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:20,750
but of all Middle-earth.

139
00:10:23,416 --> 00:10:26,000
He seeks to rule it
not only through conquest,

140
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:31,000
but by bending the minds and wills
of all its peoples to his own.

141
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:33,333
And for that, he needs not armies...

142
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:36,583
but Rings.

143
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:40,583
And he cannot craft them
without Celebrimbor.

144
00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:45,666
Sauron is alone, without army or ally.

145
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:49,916
Eregion is protected by two rivers

146
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,250
with miles of curtain wall
of dwarven stone, ten-foot thick.

147
00:10:56,916 --> 00:11:01,625
Rest assured,
Celebrimbor and the secrets of his craft

148
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:03,416
are safe.

149
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,500

[foreboding music plays]

151
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:27,708
I tell you,
some veiled evil closes in on Celebrimbor.

152
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:32,250
Sauron's plan is in motion even now.

153
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:33,958
I know it.

154
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:36,875
How?

155
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:42,500
Since the wearing of this Ring,
I have felt...

156
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:45,375
perceived...

157
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:48,750
glimpses of the unseen world...

158
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:54,541
as dreams unbidden,
coming forth to crowd my waking mind.

159
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:58,458
You believe the Rings
have kindled your ability

160
00:11:58,541 --> 00:12:01,416
to see that
which has not yet come to pass?

161
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:05,875
Have they kindled yours?

162
00:12:10,375 --> 00:12:12,541
I have seen mountains crumbling.

163
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:18,375
Waters running dry. And clouds. Black.
Gathering over white towers.

164
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:21,291
-Then send me to Eregion.
-Galadriel...

165
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:24,625
-If Sauron is there, I will send word...
-You cannot face Sauron again.

166
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:31,125
It is said that once the Deceiver
obtains a being's trust,

167
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:34,500
he gains the ability
to sculpt their very thoughts.

168
00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:39,208
To deceive not only their heart and mind,
but their eyes and ears.

169
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:41,708
To alter their very reality.

170
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:45,250
You have already been affected once.

171
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:49,208
Yes.

172
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:52,208
He knows my mind.

173
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:55,333
And I know his.

174
00:12:56,416 --> 00:12:58,541
Which is why I must face him.

175
00:12:59,416 --> 00:13:01,708
Why I alone can slay him.

176
00:13:01,791 --> 00:13:04,208
You once considered him a friend.

177
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:06,458
-Halbrand was not a...
-Sauron.

178
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:09,750
You cannot face him alone.

179
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:14,958
Supposing... I was not alone?

180
00:13:15,583 --> 00:13:17,958
[bell tolling]

[indistinct chatter]

183
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:43,166
Lord Celebrimbor regrets to inform you
he's unable to grant you entry.

184
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,708
Mightn't I speak with him directly?

185
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:48,083
[Mirdania] My lord is occupied.

186
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:50,583
But he wishes you good fortune
on your journey.

187
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:52,833
Are you asking me to leave?

188
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:57,750
The Lord of Eregion is asking you.

189
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:02,375
Perhaps I'll just wait here.

190
00:14:06,625 --> 00:14:08,375
Just in case he changes his mind.

191
00:14:23,791 --> 00:14:24,625
Is he gone?

192
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:27,208
No. He refuses to leave, my lord.

193
00:14:30,625 --> 00:14:32,291
Well, he can refuse all he cares to.

194
00:14:32,375 --> 00:14:36,458
I promised Lady Galadriel before she left
that I would never treat with him again.

195
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:42,125
Was there something more?

196
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:44,375
I believe he's injured, my lord.

197
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:46,916
Let him be.

198
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:49,583
He'll leave soon enough.

199
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:53,541
Messengers from Lindon
should arrive with news any day.

[disembodied voices

209
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:25,708
What tidings from the white wings?

210
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:28,291
Sauron's shadow is deepening.

211
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:33,541
It is said he has taken a new form
to deceive his enemies.

212
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:34,583
And the <i>Istar?</i>

213
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:41,375
I hear whispers from salt scavengers
and <i>mûmakil</i> thieves.

214
00:18:42,375 --> 00:18:48,375
Whispers of an old man in rags,
traveling east with two halflings.

215
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:50,375
He is lost. Vulnerable.

216
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:52,666
[Dark Wizard] But he will not be for long.

217
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:55,916
We must reach him before he learns
to harness his powers.

218
00:18:56,833 --> 00:19:00,666
Perhaps, the blood I wasted
to bring you before me

219
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:05,416
should have been spent
on more useful servants.

[stone door slides open]

221

[female messenger acolyte] Master.

222
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,750
One of the trackers
you sent out has returned.

223
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:20,541
[Dark Wizard] Have you found him?

224
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:23,833
[Bränk] I didn't just find him.
I know how to capture him.

225
00:19:23,916 --> 00:19:29,541
Heal the curse upon our flesh,
and I will bring you the <i>Istar</i> in chains.

226
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:35,166
What makes you think a mortal
like yourself

227
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:37,458
could defeat an <i>Istar</i>

228
00:19:37,541 --> 00:19:41,833
when my most powerful acolytes could not?

229
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:47,666
[Bränk] The <i>Istar</i> will surrender to me,
because if he doesn't,

230
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:51,666
I will slaughter
the halflings he calls friends.

231
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:58,041
What about Doderick?

232
00:20:00,458 --> 00:20:01,750
Doderick?

233
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:04,875
[Nori] All right, all right. Andwise?

234
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:08,791
[Stranger] It is a fine name.
Nevertheless, it is not going to be mine.

235
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:11,208
I know.

236
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:13,000
Fredagard.

237
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:16,833
But don't you see?

238
00:20:17,958 --> 00:20:20,166
No one can give you a name.

239
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,833
It is yours already.

240
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:25,875
It is who you are.

241
00:20:27,916 --> 00:20:33,125
And when you hear it spoken,
you feel your heart glow.

242
00:20:34,291 --> 00:20:36,000
You'll hear it one day.

243
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:39,375
I'm sure of it.

244
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:42,291
We'll find out who you are.

245
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:46,000
[Poppy] I knew it!

246
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:47,625
Says here if we turn northeast,

247
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:50,125
we can cut this leg
of the journey in half.

248
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,708
Over there. Come on!

249
00:20:52,791 --> 00:20:54,916
[captivating music playing]

250
00:21:08,791 --> 00:21:10,708
[Stranger] My preference
would be to avoid the path

251
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:12,833
on which we would
run out of water the first day

252
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:15,125
and die of heat the second.

253
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:18,666
But perhaps that is just me?

254
00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:24,708
How about Doderick?

255
00:21:26,166 --> 00:21:27,791
You already said Doderick.

256
00:21:30,208 --> 00:21:31,375
No, I didn't.

257
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:33,166
-[Stranger] Yes, you did.
-[Poppy] Yes, you did.

Ah, how fares the forager this time?

00:21:40,291 --> 00:21:43,208
All I found was a scorpion
and a clump of cactus.

The scorpion stung me,
I fell over, and, well... [clears throat]

-That's how I found the cactus.
-That's how you found the cactus.

S'plenty of sticks all over the place.

Don't think it works that way, Pop.

On the wind. Can you hear that?

00:22:18,541 --> 00:22:20,333

-Hooves.

They're watching our trail.

284
00:23:53,416 --> 00:23:55,583
Meaning, we'd be wise to find another.

285

[female stone singer 2]
It's not just the gardens.

00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:42,041
Rumors abound of dark omens
across all the Dwarven realms.

291
00:24:43,166 --> 00:24:47,125
Some say the mountain was cursed
when the prince let in that Elf.

292
00:24:47,208 --> 00:24:49,875
You two wouldn't be trafficking
in conjecture, would you?

293
00:24:49,958 --> 00:24:51,416
-No.
-Wouldn't dream of it.

00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:54,083
Good. 'Cause a rumor's like a songbird.

295

May sound filling from afar,
but up close, it's an empty feast.

296
00:24:58,958 --> 00:25:00,291
Then it isn't true?

297
00:25:00,958 --> 00:25:03,083
That something terrible is happening?

298
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:07,041
We're about to prove it isn't.

[grunts] Sire.

303
00:25:28,875 --> 00:25:31,958
Not long ago, a fire-mountain awoke.

304
00:25:32,625 --> 00:25:36,833
And although it resides far to our south,

305
00:25:36,916 --> 00:25:39,625
the ground-shakes it produced

306
00:25:39,708 --> 00:25:44,208
spread through the bones of the earth
all the way here,

307
00:25:44,291 --> 00:25:46,208
collapsing our sun-shafts,

308
00:25:47,125 --> 00:25:50,666
and with them, our ability to grow crops.

[grunts]

310
00:25:54,208 --> 00:25:56,958
Now, the obvious remedy

311
00:25:57,041 --> 00:25:59,708
is to set the dig-teams
to work repairing the shafts

312
00:25:59,791 --> 00:26:02,250
and sinking new ones. However...

313
00:26:02,333 --> 00:26:07,208
Every Stone-singer you've brought here
has failed to identify a safe path to dig.

314
00:26:07,291 --> 00:26:09,041
I'm afraid that's true.

315
00:26:11,791 --> 00:26:15,291
With your approval, sire,
we will find the light.

316
00:26:15,375 --> 00:26:16,625
You have it.

[King Durin] For nine centuries,

00:27:34,041 --> 00:27:38,791
And in all those years, not once,

325
00:27:38,875 --> 00:27:44,875
not once have they ever ceased
to provide for us.

326
00:27:48,541 --> 00:27:52,916
But now, whatever the cause,

327
00:27:55,708 --> 00:27:57,500
the bond is broken.

328
00:27:57,583 --> 00:28:01,583
The hand of darkness
has closed around Khazad-dûm.

329
00:28:01,666 --> 00:28:03,541
Dig carefully, Delve-master.

330
00:28:08,458 --> 00:28:09,375
[sighs wearily]

331
00:28:18,875 --> 00:28:20,208
Disa.

332
00:28:22,125 --> 00:28:23,291
A moment?

333
00:28:32,875 --> 00:28:34,791
Are you really going to make me ask?

334
00:28:36,208 --> 00:28:39,041
Do you mean your grandchildren?
They're well.

335
00:28:39,125 --> 00:28:41,125
They miss tugging your beard,
of course, but...

336
00:28:41,208 --> 00:28:44,416
You needn't make this harder
than it already is.

337
00:28:45,458 --> 00:28:48,125
Funny. I keep saying
the same thing to him.

338
00:28:49,958 --> 00:28:53,000
Surely Durin knows I spoke in anger!

339
00:28:53,083 --> 00:28:56,166
If that's an apology I hear, King,
try saying it to my husband.

340
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:58,458
Why should it be me who apologizes?

341
00:28:59,666 --> 00:29:01,500
It was he who caused offense!

342
00:29:02,958 --> 00:29:04,125
I tell you, he's...

343
00:29:04,208 --> 00:29:07,125
Stubborn as a root-bound parsnip?

344
00:29:08,458 --> 00:29:11,041
One more quality the two of you
have in common.

345
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:14,541
What you call "stubbornness,"

346
00:29:15,625 --> 00:29:18,291
some Dwarves call "strength."

347
00:29:19,375 --> 00:29:24,875
Oh, I imagine it does take strength
to carry a grudge so heavy.

348
00:29:26,375 --> 00:29:30,833
To keep your wounded heart
so tightly bound, it can barely beat.

349
00:29:33,041 --> 00:29:34,291
Aye, it does.

350
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,416
It truly does.

351
00:29:45,166 --> 00:29:47,875
No wonder we can't hear the mountain.

352
00:29:47,958 --> 00:29:50,875
Its King is deaf to the sorrow
of his own son.

353
00:29:50,958 --> 00:29:52,375
Still your axe, Disa!

354
00:29:52,458 --> 00:29:55,291
[Disa] You want to show true strength?

355
00:29:56,166 --> 00:29:58,041
Summon your son to you.

356
00:30:00,208 --> 00:30:01,541
He'll answer.

357
00:30:03,166 --> 00:30:07,458
But leave it to him
and the peaks of Zirakzigil will thaw

358
00:30:07,541 --> 00:30:09,375
before this feud of yours will.

We're gonna have to work all night.

No shame in it. Even I've had 'em.

00:30:32,375 --> 00:30:35,416
-Oh, y'have?
-[Barduk] Aye. When I was five!

[both laugh]

00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,541
Aye, palace hands.

370

[miners chuckling]

Don't fret, Prince, only 13 hours to go.

373
00:30:45,375 --> 00:30:48,541
Aye. It's his fault we're in this mess.

374
00:30:48,625 --> 00:30:49,750
And his father.

375
00:30:50,833 --> 00:30:51,833
Eh?

376
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:57,958
Lay a finger on me again,
I'll bite it off at the knuckle.

[melancholic music playing]

382
00:31:20,916 --> 00:31:22,083
How was the mine?

383
00:31:26,458 --> 00:31:27,458
'Bout the same.

384
00:31:30,625 --> 00:31:32,041
Where are the weans?

385
00:31:32,125 --> 00:31:34,333
Said they weren't hungry. Again.

386
00:31:34,791 --> 00:31:36,041
Well, I can't blame 'em.

387
00:31:36,833 --> 00:31:39,125
This rye tastes like last year's bread.

388
00:31:39,208 --> 00:31:40,791
It is last year's bread.

389
00:31:42,416 --> 00:31:45,083
Why not trade for fresh grain
from the surface?

390
00:31:45,791 --> 00:31:47,416
Splendid idea!

391
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:51,125
But who in the Dimrill Dale will we find
to convince your father of it?

392
00:31:51,208 --> 00:31:53,708
-Don't start.
-Um... Let me think...

393
00:31:53,791 --> 00:31:54,916
I said don't.

394
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,583
Ah, climb off your high peak
and apologize!

395
00:31:57,666 --> 00:32:00,541
-You're giving me indigestion.
-Good! Now listen to your guts!

396
00:32:00,625 --> 00:32:01,875
I am!

397
00:32:02,583 --> 00:32:05,125
And they still say I was right.

398
00:32:05,208 --> 00:32:08,541
If he hadn't have
thrown Elrond out to rot,

399
00:32:08,625 --> 00:32:10,708
we'd have food enough for 500 years!

400
00:32:10,791 --> 00:32:12,875
You think this is about food?

401
00:32:15,958 --> 00:32:18,791
We can't hear the mountains anymore.

402
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,750
I'm afraid, Durin.

403
00:32:29,541 --> 00:32:30,833
I'm afraid.

404
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:34,916
Disa... Come here.

405
00:32:36,875 --> 00:32:39,166
[Disa sighs heavily]

406
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,416
We're Dwarves.

407
00:32:44,541 --> 00:32:45,958
We'll find a way.

408
00:32:48,458 --> 00:32:50,083
We always have.

409
00:32:51,375 --> 00:32:52,541
How?

410
00:33:03,458 --> 00:33:05,125
[indistinct chatter]

411
00:33:17,166 --> 00:33:21,333
[Galadriel] Our letters to Celebrimbor
have all gone unanswered.

412
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:23,458
I fear Sauron may be in Eregion.

413
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:27,750
The High King has consented
to send me and a small party there,

414
00:33:28,583 --> 00:33:30,791
to ensure Celebrimbor
and his city are safe.

415
00:33:32,916 --> 00:33:34,708
I'm asking you to join us.

416
00:33:35,583 --> 00:33:36,458
[scoffs]

417
00:33:37,708 --> 00:33:40,250
As you are so fond
of reminding me, Galadriel,

418
00:33:42,125 --> 00:33:43,416
I am but a politician.

419
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:45,750
And as such,
you have the High King's trust.

420
00:33:47,375 --> 00:33:48,833
He believes in your steadfastness.

421
00:33:48,916 --> 00:33:52,416
A dog is steadfast.
And quicker to follow on a leash.

422
00:33:59,416 --> 00:34:01,250
He refuses to send me without you.

423
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:05,000
[Elrond] And why is that?

424
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:08,166
-You know the reason.
-I'm asking if you know it.

425
00:34:10,166 --> 00:34:15,083
The High King believes,
that if I were to face the Enemy alone,

426
00:34:16,291 --> 00:34:18,041
I may be vulnerable to deception.

427
00:34:18,583 --> 00:34:20,000
And why would he think that?

428
00:34:20,083 --> 00:34:21,041
Stop it, Elrond.

429
00:34:23,375 --> 00:34:25,291
[Elrond] You've defied
the High King's orders before.

430
00:34:25,375 --> 00:34:26,875
Why not do so now?

431
00:34:28,458 --> 00:34:29,791
Because he is right.

432
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,375
Sauron used me.

433
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:37,041
And under his hand, I was played like
a harp to a melody not of my choosing.

434
00:34:38,916 --> 00:34:40,916
It was entirely of your choosing.

435
00:34:43,083 --> 00:34:44,875
Sauron looked inside you,

436
00:34:44,958 --> 00:34:48,000
plucked the very song of your soul,
note by note,

437
00:34:49,208 --> 00:34:51,375
making himself out to be
exactly what you needed.

438
00:34:51,458 --> 00:34:53,458
"The Lost King"
who could ride you to victory.

439
00:34:53,541 --> 00:34:56,250
You gave him everything he wanted
and then thanked him for it.

440
00:34:56,333 --> 00:34:58,250
And now he has done the same to Gil-galad.

441
00:34:58,333 --> 00:34:59,791
And to every Elf in Lindon.

442
00:35:00,958 --> 00:35:04,291
And that is why we need you.
Help us navigate this labyrinth.

443
00:35:04,375 --> 00:35:06,041
[Elrond] There is no navigating it.

444
00:35:06,125 --> 00:35:08,041
The labyrinth is his.

445
00:35:09,416 --> 00:35:11,958
As long as you stay in it,
you've already lost.

446
00:35:13,333 --> 00:35:16,625
-He may well want you in Eregion...
-Please, Elrond.

447
00:35:18,833 --> 00:35:20,791
I cannot let him in again.

448
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:23,875
I cannot.

449
00:35:46,041 --> 00:35:48,500
He never left, Galadriel.

450
00:35:50,416 --> 00:35:52,750
In choosing to wear those Rings,

451
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:56,583
you have all chosen
to become his collaborators.

452
00:35:58,291 --> 00:36:00,083
I will have no part in it.

453
00:36:01,708 --> 00:36:03,208
You promised me once,

454
00:36:04,875 --> 00:36:08,458
"If but a whisper of a rumor"
of what I feared proved true,

455
00:36:09,666 --> 00:36:11,833
you would not rest until it was put right.

456
00:36:14,583 --> 00:36:16,833
If our friendship
ever meant anything to you,

457
00:36:19,708 --> 00:36:20,708
please leave.

458
00:36:49,166 --> 00:36:50,875
[Círdan] <i>Do you not wish
to live in beauty?</i>

459
00:36:51,958 --> 00:36:54,791
[Elrond] Master Círdan,
I cannot trust these Rings.

460
00:36:54,875 --> 00:36:57,583
What is beauty, when it is born,
in part, of evil?

461
00:36:58,125 --> 00:36:59,541
No less beautiful.

462
00:37:01,416 --> 00:37:02,583
Not to me.

463
00:37:02,666 --> 00:37:05,416
Would you cast Rúmil's verses
into the flame,

464
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:07,166
because the poet was a drunkard?

465
00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:14,625
Rúmil was a drunkard?

466
00:37:15,541 --> 00:37:16,375
[chuckles softly]

467
00:37:16,916 --> 00:37:19,541
Do not ask of Daeron. [scoffs]

468
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:21,791
Insufferable.

469
00:37:23,041 --> 00:37:24,791
But a voice,

470
00:37:24,875 --> 00:37:29,750
a voice that could make
the very sun weep tears of fire.

471
00:37:32,875 --> 00:37:34,375
Judge the work,

472
00:37:36,375 --> 00:37:38,875
and leave judgment
concerning those who wrought it

473
00:37:38,958 --> 00:37:41,833
to the judge who sees all things.

474
00:37:41,916 --> 00:37:43,791
That feels impossible.

475
00:37:45,958 --> 00:37:47,458
It is called humility.

476
00:37:47,541 --> 00:37:49,791
And it is difficult for most.

477
00:37:49,875 --> 00:37:52,250
But it is the truest form of sight.

478
00:38:03,458 --> 00:38:07,125
I wish I could know your peace.

479
00:38:09,541 --> 00:38:10,791
You can.

480
00:38:17,625 --> 00:38:20,958
We do not yet fully understand
these Rings.

481
00:38:21,041 --> 00:38:24,875
But look at the power they exert
over every form of life.

482
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:35,833
In Sauron's hands,
they could work an evil beyond reckoning,

483
00:38:35,916 --> 00:38:38,750
dominating the minds and wills of all.

484
00:38:39,291 --> 00:38:43,166
This is why they must remain
in the hands of Elves.

485
00:38:45,666 --> 00:38:49,458
You are wise to fear this power, Elrond.

486
00:38:51,875 --> 00:38:56,875
But do not let that fear blind you
to the ways it can be used for good.

487
00:38:59,666 --> 00:39:02,000
For it is not your enemy,
that bears these Rings...

488
00:39:04,125 --> 00:39:08,083
But your most trusted friends.

489
00:39:08,708 --> 00:39:12,708
If you believe they have strayed,
do not abandon them,

490
00:39:12,791 --> 00:39:17,875
but rather open your eyes
and guide them...

491
00:39:18,541 --> 00:39:22,208
Before the darkness
spreads across Middle-earth,

492
00:39:22,291 --> 00:39:24,625
and blinds us all.

00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:19,500
[Poppy] I saw it. I know I saw it. C'mon.

504
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:21,291
[Nori] Poppy, he's not breathin' anymore!

505
00:40:23,666 --> 00:40:25,833
There! Yes! Nori, I can see it!

506
00:40:26,541 --> 00:40:27,958
[Nori] See what?

507
00:40:28,041 --> 00:40:29,583
Water.

508
00:40:31,458 --> 00:40:35,375
How could someone
who hasn't eaten in so long

509
00:40:35,458 --> 00:40:37,750
still weigh so much?

510

[Nori sighs] Great goats, you're alive.

528
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:44,916
For a moment there,
I thought we'd lost... we'd lost you.

[water splashing]

You don't think...

539
00:42:34,083 --> 00:42:39,041
It is not dissimilar
from the staff I saw in my dream.

Whatever the reason
for your presence here,

00:47:12,875 --> 00:47:16,250
if you do not leave willingly,
you shall be removed by force.

594
00:47:18,208 --> 00:47:19,833
I can treat with you no longer.

595
00:47:23,333 --> 00:47:24,750
She said you'd say that.

596
00:47:29,375 --> 00:47:32,583
Galadriel? You have spoken with her?

597
00:47:34,083 --> 00:47:35,125
Well, haven't you?

598
00:47:35,666 --> 00:47:36,583
I have not.

599
00:47:37,750 --> 00:47:39,500
Not since she left for Lindon.

600
00:47:40,416 --> 00:47:42,500
Then you know nothing of what's happened?

601
00:47:43,875 --> 00:47:45,166
Nothing of the Rings?

602
00:47:48,375 --> 00:47:49,750
What of the Rings?

603
00:47:51,833 --> 00:47:52,833
Have they worked?

604
00:47:55,208 --> 00:47:56,750
You'd do better to ask her.

605
00:47:57,250 --> 00:47:58,416
[Celebrimbor] She's not here.

606
00:47:59,541 --> 00:48:00,416
You are.

607
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:02,041
What about the High King?

608
00:48:02,125 --> 00:48:04,916
Surely he wouldn't neglect
to send word of...

609
00:48:06,958 --> 00:48:08,250
Oh, I see.

610
00:48:10,166 --> 00:48:13,375
It's the oldest tale there is, isn't it?

611
00:48:16,375 --> 00:48:19,666
The true creators toil
till their knuckles bleed

612
00:48:20,833 --> 00:48:24,750
and then they come along,
take whatever profits them most,

613
00:48:25,708 --> 00:48:27,458
and forget all about us.

614
00:48:30,666 --> 00:48:32,416
I applaud your patience.

615
00:48:34,541 --> 00:48:36,083
Where are you going?

616
00:48:36,166 --> 00:48:38,500
There's no cause
to stay where I'm not wanted.

617
00:48:40,791 --> 00:48:41,791
Wait.

618
00:48:55,458 --> 00:48:57,583
Halbrand. Please. Tell me.

619
00:48:58,916 --> 00:49:02,833
The Rings. Did they work?

620
00:49:11,708 --> 00:49:13,291
They worked wonders.

621
00:49:17,041 --> 00:49:18,625
Then, the Elves...

622
00:49:18,708 --> 00:49:19,708
[Halbrand] Yes.

623
00:49:24,708 --> 00:49:26,916
And, uh, Lindon?

624
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Yes.

[laughs]

629
00:49:42,583 --> 00:49:44,208
I am reveling.

630
00:49:46,125 --> 00:49:49,083
You have not the slightest inkling...

631
00:49:51,791 --> 00:49:53,291
how this feels.

632
00:49:53,375 --> 00:49:55,708
After all this time,
after so many centuries,

633
00:49:55,791 --> 00:49:58,375
to finally create something.

634
00:50:01,166 --> 00:50:02,875
I'm going to open a First Age bottle.

635
00:50:05,166 --> 00:50:08,291
I have been saving it.

636
00:50:13,875 --> 00:50:15,125
Celebrimbor...

637
00:50:21,625 --> 00:50:22,958
Are you my friend?

638
00:50:24,916 --> 00:50:26,250
Yes, of course.

639
00:50:27,791 --> 00:50:28,833
Why?

640
00:50:28,916 --> 00:50:30,791
Because there is no place for half-truths

641
00:50:30,875 --> 00:50:33,791
between those who've worked
so close as you and I.

642
00:50:34,791 --> 00:50:35,625
Oh...

643
00:50:37,208 --> 00:50:40,958
And yet there is much you do not know.

644
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:43,666
Much I want to tell you.

645
00:50:45,458 --> 00:50:46,458
Only...

646
00:50:49,291 --> 00:50:50,750
You're afraid.

647
00:50:52,458 --> 00:50:55,333
You see? I've never been able
to hide anything from you.

648
00:50:56,958 --> 00:50:58,125
Well...

649
00:51:02,750 --> 00:51:04,083
Be at ease.

650
00:51:07,333 --> 00:51:10,583
Whatever it is you wish to say to me,
I shall receive it with an open heart.

651
00:51:13,166 --> 00:51:15,375
I did not come here
to toast the Elven Rings.

652
00:51:17,291 --> 00:51:21,041
But to plead with you
to make Rings for Men.

653
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:23,833
Rings for Men?

654
00:51:24,791 --> 00:51:26,833
-[Halbrand] You saved the Elves.
-Uh...

655
00:51:28,166 --> 00:51:29,291
Elves are not Men.

656
00:51:30,916 --> 00:51:31,875
Men are covetous.

657
00:51:34,208 --> 00:51:36,958
The risks of,
of corruption are far greater.

658
00:51:37,625 --> 00:51:39,291
Even if I did wish to forge more Rings,

659
00:51:39,375 --> 00:51:41,208
the Dwarves would never
provide the <i>mithril.</i>

660
00:51:41,291 --> 00:51:43,916
I think you'll find the Dwarves
facing a dilemma all their own.

661
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,125
What dilemma?
What are you talking about, Halbrand?

662
00:51:48,625 --> 00:51:50,625
My name is not Halbrand.

663
00:51:52,375 --> 00:51:53,291
What?

664
00:51:53,375 --> 00:51:56,000
When Galadriel discovered the truth,
she cast me out.

665
00:51:57,250 --> 00:51:59,416
And I dare not risk the same
happening with you.

666
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:03,166
[thunder rumbling]

667
00:52:03,250 --> 00:52:06,166
I... I take it then you are not a King.

668
00:52:06,958 --> 00:52:09,500
No. Not a King.

669
00:52:10,708 --> 00:52:12,500
Not a Southlander.

670
00:52:13,166 --> 00:52:16,041
Not even a... mortal.

671
00:52:17,833 --> 00:52:18,708
[scoffs]

672
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,000
What are you?

673
00:52:22,458 --> 00:52:28,083
There are forces in this world
beyond evil, Celebrimbor.

674
00:52:28,708 --> 00:52:32,375
And sometimes, they send aid,

675
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:34,791
in the form of an envoy.

676
00:52:34,875 --> 00:52:40,541
A... A messenger, sent to bring guidance
to the ears of the wise.

677
00:52:42,041 --> 00:52:42,875
Uh...

678
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:46,708
What sort of guidance?

679
00:52:48,083 --> 00:52:50,333
Mordor's rise was but the beginning.

680
00:52:50,416 --> 00:52:53,750
At this very moment, all Middle-earth
balances on the brink of the abyss.

681
00:52:54,458 --> 00:52:56,791
Soon, every realm will fall.

682
00:52:58,208 --> 00:53:02,500
Not just Elves, but Dwarves. And Men.

683
00:53:04,541 --> 00:53:06,291
The darkness is growing stronger.

684
00:53:07,333 --> 00:53:10,583
And the Rings of Power are our last hope
of restoring the light.

685
00:53:13,791 --> 00:53:15,250
You and I have work to do.

686
00:53:20,583 --> 00:53:21,541
[chuckles softly]

687
00:53:21,625 --> 00:53:24,375
You cannot expect me to believe

688
00:53:24,458 --> 00:53:28,000
that you are a, a messenger
from the Valar sent to...

689
00:53:28,083 --> 00:53:31,375
[thunder rumbling]

690
00:53:38,708 --> 00:53:39,916
Halbrand?

691
00:53:42,250 --> 00:53:43,250
Halbrand!

692
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:52,375

Halbrand!

[breath trembling]

696
00:54:31,208 --> 00:54:34,583
[Halbrand] <i>I have walked through the dust
and the deserts of far-away lands,</i>

697
00:54:37,250 --> 00:54:43,041
<i>in search of an artist possessing
the craft to save all Middle-earth.</i>

698
00:54:45,541 --> 00:54:47,958
<i>A storm is coming, Celebrimbor.</i>

699
00:54:50,250 --> 00:54:53,375
<i>I can bring you the knowledge
none other possesses.</i>

700
00:54:53,958 --> 00:54:57,166
<i>I can unlock your grandest abilities.</i>

701
00:54:57,958 --> 00:55:00,125
<i>And when our work is complete,</i>

702
00:55:00,208 --> 00:55:05,458
<i>never again will the world overlook you
as the mere scion of Fëanor</i>

703
00:55:06,041 --> 00:55:08,333
but forevermore revere you...

704
00:55:14,291 --> 00:55:16,708
The Lord of the Rings.

705
00:55:41,958 --> 00:55:43,666
You need not bow to me.

706
00:55:44,416 --> 00:55:46,500
But I have beheld your natural form.

707
00:55:49,833 --> 00:55:51,000
Rise.

708
00:55:53,708 --> 00:55:55,416
Our work begins now.

709
00:55:56,666 --> 00:55:58,500
What am I to call you?

710
00:55:58,583 --> 00:55:59,666
[Halbrand] I am your partner.

711
00:56:02,125 --> 00:56:04,958
No more, no less.

712
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,875
A sharer of gifts.

713
00:56:11,375 --> 00:56:12,916
Annatar.

714
00:56:14,708 --> 00:56:16,166
Annatar.

715
00:56:19,958 --> 00:56:21,666
Lord of Gifts.

716
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:39,583
You summoned me.

717
00:56:40,416 --> 00:56:42,125
You have new orders, Commander.

718
00:56:42,916 --> 00:56:47,541
You depart for Eregion at first light,
with five of our bravest Elves.

719
00:56:48,708 --> 00:56:49,708
I...

720
00:56:51,708 --> 00:56:54,541
Thank you for reconsidering.

721
00:56:54,625 --> 00:56:56,708
It is not I, you ought to thank.

722
00:56:59,833 --> 00:57:00,916
[Galadriel] Elrond.

723
00:57:05,250 --> 00:57:08,458
I am very grateful you have decided
to join my company.

724
00:57:11,208 --> 00:57:13,708
I'm afraid you misunderstand, Galadriel.

725
00:57:14,875 --> 00:57:17,791
Elrond's task is not to join your company.

726
00:57:18,541 --> 00:57:20,208
But to lead it.

727

What is it? Is it Elrond?

730
00:58:01,916 --> 00:58:04,708
It's some sort of invitation...

731
00:58:06,250 --> 00:58:08,916
from Lord Celebrimbor.

732
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:12,041
He wants the Dwarves to come to Eregion.
