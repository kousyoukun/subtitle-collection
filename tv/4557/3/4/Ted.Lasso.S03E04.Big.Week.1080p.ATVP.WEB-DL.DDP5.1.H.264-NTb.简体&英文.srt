1
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:26,940
搞什么啊
Fucking hell.

2
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:31,150
好的 我们开始吧
All right, let's go.

3
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:32,570
现在是凌晨4点
It's 4:00 a.m.

4
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:34,700
对 我们凌晨4点开始
Yeah. We start at 4:00 a.m.

5
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:35,910
我以为你是开玩笑
I thought you were joking.

6
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:37,160
那怎么会是开玩笑
How is that a joke?

7
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:38,580
因为是凌晨4点
'Cause it's 4:00 a.m.

8
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:42,830
我们凌晨4点开始 这样每天 你可以进行三次健身 而不是两次
We start at 4:00, so you can do three workouts a day instead of two.

9
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:46,290
好的 但现在是凌晨4点
Okay, but it's 4:00 a.m.

10
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,590
你到底想不想超越扎瓦
Do you wanna be better than Zava or not?

11
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:52,710
我们要怎么看清东西 天还是黑的
Well, how are we gonna see? It's dark out.

12
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,430
搞什么鬼啊
Fucking hell.

13
00:00:56,930 --> 00:00:59,560
去穿衣服 否则我会弹你的睾丸
Now get dressed. Or I start flicking your balls.

14
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:01,850
你真变态
This is perverse.

15
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:15,820
(必威)

16
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:25,410
(西汉姆对里士满)

17
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,720
哎哟
Whoops.

18
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,520
好的
There you go.

19
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,570
(泰德 谢谢你为我做的一切 内森)

20
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:07,660
早安 靓女蓝精灵
Good morning, Sassy Smurf.

21
00:02:09,290 --> 00:02:11,170
早安 万宝路男
Good morning, Marlboro Man.

22
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,210
你知道 你整晚都在打鼾
You know, you snored all night.

23
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:16,170
很抱歉
I'm sorry about that.

24
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:18,760
没事 其实挺令人安心的
That's all right. It's actually very soothing.

25
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,050
像大海的声音
Sounded like the sea.

26
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:22,760
很高兴你没听到船鸣笛的声音
Well, I'm glad you didn't hear any boat horns,

27
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,600
鉴于我昨晚吃了那么多炸山药
given all the fried yams I ate last night.

28
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:34,440
嘿 我在想 我们在一起总是很开心 对吧
Hey, I was thinking. We have a good time together, yeah?

29
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:37,150
泰德 是的 人称其为“同时高潮”
They're called simultaneous orgasms, Ted, yes.

30
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,740
对 但我的意思是
Yeah, well, but I mean

31
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:43,240
还有聊天 说笑这些 对吗
also all the talking and laughing and all that stuff. Yeah?

32
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:46,500
当然 除了你那些恼人的双关语
Sure. Well, apart from all your dreadful puns.

33
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:48,750
是 是很难
Right. Well, it's tough.

34
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:51,790
有时就在嘴边 我不得不说出来 你懂吗
Sometimes I just see 'em there, and I gotta take a swing at 'em, you know?

35
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,630
不 我...我的意思是
No, I-- Well, what I'm getting at is...

36
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,930
我在想 也许...
Well, I was just thinking maybe...

37
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:03,300
我们可以找天来次真正的约会
we could go on an actual date sometime.

38
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,760
你和我 我们一起
You know? You and me, together.

39
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,810
天啊 不要
God, no.

40
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:12,440
我很感谢你仔细考虑了再回答
Well, I appreciate you taking the time to consider it.

41
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,730
泰德 我们不能约会
Ted, we can't date.

42
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:15,730
为什么
Why not?

43
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:19,070
-你生活一团乱麻 -我一团乱
- You're a mess. - I'm a mess?

44
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:20,700
当然了
Course you are.

45
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:24,160
我也是一团乱麻 但我的这一团 比你进度超前了三年
I'm a mess too, but I'm a mess three years further on than you,

46
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,580
所以我现在只是一丝乱麻
so I'm more of a slight disarray.

47
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,790
要我说 你是一丝明媚美好的乱麻
More like a slight disarray of sunshine, if you ask me.

48
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:30,210
天啊
Oh, God.

49
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:33,830
-抱歉 -泰德 我前任再婚那天
- Sorry. - Ted, on the day my ex got remarried,

50
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:36,670
我用吸管喝了一瓶红酒
I drank a bottle of red wine through a straw

51
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:39,880
告诉优步司机说我爱上他了
and told my Uber driver I was in love with him.

52
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:43,680
然后 他送我到家时 我吐个不停
Then, when he dropped me home, I puked so much,

53
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,760
嘴巴就像《闪灵》里那台电梯
my mouth was like an elevator from the goddamn Shining.

54
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:49,640
我的评分被降到了3.9
Knocked my rating down to a 3.9.

55
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,930
3.9
3.9?

56
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:54,150
去你的 干吗这个语气 你是多少
Fuck you. Why? What's yours?

57
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:58,190
天啊 你是五星乘客 对吗
Oh, God, you're a five, aren't you?

58
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:01,740
你当然是五星 你怎么拿到五星的
Course you're a five. How the fuck are you a five?

59
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:04,700
不知道 我干净整洁 我说 “请你”和“谢谢你”
I don't know. I'm tidy. I say "Please" and "Thank you."

60
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,780
有时他们看起来很累的话 我会提出我来开车
Sometimes I offer to drive if they look tired.

61
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:10,410
你真是一团乱麻
You are such a mess.

62
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:16,380
泰德 我喜欢我们现在的状态
Ted, I like our status.

63
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:22,010
炮友关系 就像 娜塔莉波特曼和艾什顿库奇
Friends with benefits, like Natalie Portman and Ashton Kutcher.

64
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:25,220
不 我觉得你想的是2011年另一部
No. I think you're thinking of 2011's other

65
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:27,390
“好友变成偶尔的床友”浪漫喜剧

《爱情无线牵》
No Strings Attached.

67
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,650
《朋友也上床》是 米拉库尼斯和贾斯汀汀布莱克
Friends with Benefits was Mila Kunis and Justin Timberlake.

68
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:38,230
天啊 2011年朋友们都忙着上床啊
Wow. 2011, friends be fuckin'.

69
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:39,360
是
Yeah.

70
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,440
那么 让我们活在2011年 轻松又自在
So, let's keep things 2011. Cool and breezy.

71
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,320
宛如阿拉伯之春
Like an Arab Spring.

72
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,120
祝你们这周末对战西汉姆好运
And good luck against West Ham this weekend.

73
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:52,750
鲁伯特去死吧
Fuck Rupert

74
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:56,040
他好意思称为“蛋蛋”的 皱皮口袋也可以去死
and that shriveled raisin-pouch he calls a nutsack.

75
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:13,140
你好 是弗洛叫的
Hello! Here for Flo?

76
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:14,940
-你可以上车 亲爱的 -太好了 谢谢
- You can jump in, love. - Lovely, thank you.

77
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:18,810
真不错 灰色车座 谢谢
This is nice. Gray seats? Yes, please.

78
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:20,860
...西汉姆 这是真正的机会
...West Ham. This is the real opportunity

79
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:22,570
奇迹小子可以从此化身为奇迹男人
for the Wonder Kid to become the Wonder Man...

80
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:24,070
101
101.

81
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,410
100
100.

82
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,990
99
Ninety-nine.

83
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:35,120
你为什么睡觉只穿上衣
Why do you only sleep with a top on?

84
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:39,000
因为我上身冷 下身热
Because I get cold upstairs and hot downstairs.

85
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:41,130
我懂
I get that.

86
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:45,720
早啊
Mornin'.

87
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,900
足球教练

本WEB版外挂字幕由  风吹来的那片云  双语合并

89
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,120
你听听鲁伯特在这里是怎么说的
Listen to what Rupert said in this one.

90
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:14,040
“我真的很期待再次见到我的旧俱乐部
"I truly look forward to seeing my old club again.

91
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,330
里士满是一流的球队”
Richmond are top-class."

92
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:19,580
-真是个软骨头的废材 -谢谢你
- What a soggy, wet piece of shit. - Thank you.

93
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,800
是 我去训练场了 再次感谢你给我这个机会
Right, I'm off to the training ground. Thanks again for the opportunity.

94
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,840
宝贝 这是你应得的
Babe, you earned it.

95
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,050
珊迪和我想出了 一个超级好玩的伴伴营销点子
Shandy came up with this super fun Bantr promo.

96
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:33,180
要用上球队所有单身球员
It uses all the single players on the team.

97
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:34,430
对
Yeah.

98
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:38,520
你在“伴伴”的匿名男子也许是 一位职业足球员
The anonymous man you're Bantr-ing with could be a professional footballer.

99
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:41,810
真棒啊
That's great.

100
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:44,610
你是说所有单身球员都参与
And that's all the single players, you say?

101
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:48,700
所以是科林 丹尼 山姆等等
So, it's, like, Colin and Dani and Sam, et cetera?

102
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,950
对 但山姆好像不会再参与了
Yeah, although I don't think Sam's doing it anymore.

103
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:54,370
-不会 -真好玩
- No. - So fun.

104
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,160
-琼斯女士 -你好 芭芭拉
- Ms. Jones. - Hello, Barbara.

105
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,120
-小芭 你好吗  -叫我“芭芭拉”
- All right there, Barbs? - It's "Barbara."

106
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:00,120
-小芭 你好吗  -叫我“芭芭拉”
- All right there, Barbs? - It's "Barbara."

107
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:04,920
如果可能的话 能给我两张 里士满对西汉姆的比赛门票吗
If possible, could I get two tickets for the Richmond-West Ham match?

108
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:07,050
杰克这周末可能会来伦敦
Jack might be coming to London this weekend.

109
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:08,300
没问题
Of course.

110
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,760
杰克是谁
Who's Jack?

111
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,600
杰克丹弗斯
Jack Danvers.

112
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:18,100
给你公司融资的风投老板
The head of the VC that funded your company.

113
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:20,690
我们的上司
Our boss.

114
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:27,030
是 那个杰克啊 当然了
Yes. That Jack. Of course.

115
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,900
没问题 芭芭拉
That's not a problem, Barbara.

116
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:32,700
我可以给你在我的包厢留几个座位
I can let you have some seats in my suite.

117
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:35,490
真好
Lovely.

118
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:38,750
瑞贝卡 太感谢你了 你这么做真好心 而且很高效
Thank you so much, Rebecca. That's so kind of you and so efficient.

119
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:42,250
基莉
Keeley.

120
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,300
谢谢 芭芭拉
Thanks, Barbara.

121
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:52,930
我们对战西汉姆时 一定要避开的战术就是伪九号
So, the one thing we cannot do against West Ham is the False Nine.

122
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:54,890
-因为那是内特的专长 -没错
- 'Cause that's Nate's shit. - Exactly.

123
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:57,260
所以我们决定用经典的4-4-2
So, we decided to go with our classic 4-4-2.

124
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:59,520
那混蛋肯定是这么预期的
Which is exactly what that prick expects us to do.

125
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,390
所以我们反着来 五个前锋 全面攻击
So, we do the opposite. Five up front. Full-on attack.

126
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,390
所以我们反着来 五个前锋 全面攻击
So, we do the opposite. Five up front. Full-on attack.

127
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:05,940
但是内特知道我们会这么做
But Nate knows we're gonna do that,

128
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:09,990
因为内特知道我们想要 像他那样思考 来跑赢他的思维
because Nate knows that we're trying to outthink him by thinking like him.

129
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:14,780
别管内特了 别管思维了 也别管苏格拉底了
Well, fuck Nate, fuck thinking and fuck fucking Socrates.

130
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:17,120
我们得停止像内特那样思考 而是思考一下
So, we gotta stop thinking like Nate and start thinking

131
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,910
如果内特像我们一样思考 他会认为我们会怎么思考
like Nate would think we would think if Nate were thinking like us,

132
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:22,080
采用我们代入内特的思维 去思考我们的思维
and then do the last thing that Nate thinking like us

133
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,170
而他像这样的我们一样思考时 最不可能采用的战术
thinking like Nate thinking like us would ever expect us to do.

134
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:30,670
把扎瓦放到后场 用内特的伪九号战术
Have Zava drop back and play Nate's False Nine.

135
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:31,970
便是如此
Voi-fucking-là.

136
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:34,220
高明
Brilliant.

137
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:36,470
-主要是彼尔德的想法 -不 这是集体的智慧
- It's mostly Beard's idea. - Nah, it was a group effort.

138
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:37,600
我有个问题
I do have one question.

139
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,970
-当然 -谁在乎啊
- Of course. - Who fucking cares?

140
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:41,810
你们觉得扎瓦会同意吗
Do you think Zava'll do it?

141
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:49,860
该死
Fuck!

142
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:53,150
-早安 -嗨
- Good mornin'. - Hey.

143
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:57,870
-不好 发生什么了  -罗伊觉得我们无法战胜内特
- Uh-oh, what's wrong? - Roy doesn't think we can beat Nate.

144
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:01,660
-希金斯也这么认为 -彼尔德先对我说的
- Higgins doesn't think so either! - Beard said it to me first.

145
00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:01,660
-希金斯也这么认为 -彼尔德先对我说的
- Higgins doesn't think so either! - Beard said it to me first.

146
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:04,790
-你背刺我啊 你怎么敢... -今早你到这里...
- You throw me under the bus? How dare-- - You walked in here this morning--

147
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:08,250
-你要出卖我  -停...
- You're gonna sell me out? - Whoa! Whoa.

148
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:11,090
你们互相指责的样子 比象头神给人指路时更忙啊
Y'all pointin' more fingers than Ganesha givin' directions.

149
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:14,590
听我说 你们几个得冷静下来 亲吻和好
Now look, you fellas need to calm down and just kiss.

150
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:18,220
他说得对
He's right.

151
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:21,680
保持简单 天才们
Keep it simple, smartypants.

152
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:24,430
船到桥头自然直 别担心
An answer will show up. Don't worry.

153
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:29,400
但在那之前 我有个问题要问你们大家 我是一团乱麻吗
But until it does, here's a question for y'all: Am I a mess?

154
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,900
靓女昨晚和我一起过...
Sassy ended up spending the night last night and--

155
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:38,280
不 安静 头条不是这个
No, hush your butts. That ain't the headline.

156
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,450
我今早问她要不要来次真正的约会
Well, I asked her out on a proper date this morning.

157
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:44,660
她无情地拒绝了 她说我是... 原话是“一团乱麻”
She turned me down cold. She said I was-- and I quote-- "a mess."

158
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:51,380
-对 -听上去是钻石狗开会时间
- Yeah. - Sounds like a case for the Diamond Dogs!

159
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:52,840
放出猎狗
Release the hounds.

160
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,050
对 来吧 开始
Yeah, here we go! Let's do it.

161
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:00,890
老天
Fuck's sakes.

162
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:00,890
老天
Fuck's sakes.

163
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:06,730
是
Yes.

164
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:09,650
-“是”什么  -是 你是一团乱麻
-"Yes" what? - Yes, you're a mess.

165
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:11,480
好的 请阐释
Okay. Expound.

166
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,690
我们这周要对战内特
We're playing Nate this week,

167
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:14,320
而你的表现像是这没什么大不了
and you're acting like it's not a big deal.

168
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:16,860
一切如常 仿佛他没伤害你
Nothing's different. He didn't hurt you.

169
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:18,820
嘿 我们现在不聊内特
Hey, look, we ain't talking about Nate right now.

170
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:21,910
我是问你们我是不是一团乱麻 好吗
I'm asking you if you think I'm a mess. All right?

171
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:23,080
小希希 你怎么看
Higgy pie, what do you think?

172
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:26,910
我觉得我不明白你为什么不生内特的气
I think I don't understand how you're not pissed off with Nate.

173
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:30,710
我们共同依赖症匿名互助会上 常常说到这句话
We have a saying in Co-Dependents Anonymous.

174
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:33,500
-是...什么  -简逼我和她一起去
- Y-- What? - Jane makes me go with her.

175
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:35,340
对
Yeah.

176
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:36,880
痛苦如同一氧化碳
Pain is like carbon monoxide.

177
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:40,890
向伤害了你的人 表达痛苦就像是打开通风口
Expressing it to the person who hurt you is like opening a vent,

178
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:43,180
但是憋在心里只会毒害自己
but holding it in will poison you.

179
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:46,770
我喜欢这说法 但内特没有伤害我
I like that. But Nate didn't hurt me.

180
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:47,940
胡说
Bullshit!

181
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:52,060
罗伊 你想加入钻石狗的讨论吗
Roy, did you wanna get in on this Diamond Dog situation?

182
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:54,730
-嘿 罗伊 嘿 罗伊 -嘿 罗伊 来
- Hey, Roy! Hey, Roy. - Hey, Roy. Here, Roy.

183
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:56,900
来 罗伊 来这里嘛
Here, Roy. Come here, Roy.

184
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:58,950
啦...
La, la, la, la, la!

185
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:00,030
(英超联赛 一周概要)

186
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:02,990
本周最瞩目的比赛显然是里士满对西汉姆
So, the match of the week is clearly Richmond and West Ham.

187
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:05,790
两支球队都经历了强势的赛季初
Now, it's been a strong start to the season for both of these teams,

188
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:09,000
但我认为在伦敦德比中 铁锤帮是热门
but I think the Hammers are favorites, going into the London derby,

189
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,090
基于奇迹小子内森谢利精妙的战术能力
based on the tactical acumen of the Wonder Kid, Nathan Shelley.

190
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:17,260
对 谢利很厉害 这毫无疑问
Yeah, Shelley is brilliant, there's no doubt about that,

191
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:20,880
但是扎瓦是天才 这个原因让我看好灰狗
but Zava, he is a genius. I like the Greyhounds for this one.

192
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,260
是我的兄弟
That's my guy!

193
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:24,220
不 他不属于你 他是我的
No, you can't have him. He's mine.

194
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,060
-我们继续说周日的... -嘿 各位 快看
- Let's move on, shall we, to Sunday's-- - Hey, look. Guys, guys.

195
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:30,230
谁在乎啊
Who cares, right?

196
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,310
快点 我们还有活要干 来吧
Now come on, we've got work to do. Let's go.

197
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:35,320
他说得对
He is correct.

198
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:42,610
我们必须无视这些电视人 就算他们支持我们
We must ignore these talking faces. Even when they are in our favor.

199
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,660
谢谢你 “佐罗”
Thank you, "Zorro."

200
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:48,250
没错 但是 其实念“佐豪”
Exactly, but it's actually pronounced "Zoreaux."

201
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:52,790
为什么
Why?

202
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:57,460
我不知道 可能因为 我父母就是这么叫我的
I don't know. Because that's how my parents say it, I guess?

203
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:04,050
朋友 你想怎么叫自己就怎么叫
My friend, you can be whoever you want to be.

204
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:09,680
我的所有孩子到了七岁时 我允许他们给自己起名
I let all of my children name themselves once they reach the age of seven.

205
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,980
所以我最大的孩子名叫“蠢蛋”
That is why my eldest is called "Smingus Dingus."

206
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:19,320
要有鸿鹄之志 也许理想就会实现
Dream big, and you may never wake up.

207
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:24,990
谢谢
Thank you.

208
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:26,410
天啊
Jesus.

209
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:30,620
我不敢相信我要这么说 但是嘿 各位 我同意扎瓦
I can't believe I'm about to say this, but hey, lads, I agree with Zava.

210
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:33,750
对 这是超级重要的一场比赛 但我们只需要专心踢球 做该做的事
Yes, it's a big fucking game, but we've just gotta focus, do what we do,

211
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:35,460
-懂我的意思吗  -是 他是对的
- do you know what I mean? - Yeah. He's right.

212
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:36,670
还有 别忘了
And don't forget, yeah?

213
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,970
-相信“相信” -对
- Believe in "Believe." - Yes.

214
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:45,930
搞什...
What the--

215
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:47,760
什么
What?

216
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:49,890
-见鬼 -怎么了
- Oh, shit. - What?

217
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,730
(坚信胜利)

218
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:57,610
-你干吗那么做  -我只是想看看
- Why the fuck did you do that? - I was just checking

219
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,570
我是否获得了将东西砍为两段的能力
if I acquired the ability to chop things in half.

220
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:01,070
是 如果你能呢
Yeah, and what if you had?

221
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:04,740
抱歉 哥们 我没想清楚
Sorry, bruv. I didn't think it through.

222
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:09,870
大伙 有人把这个撕成两半了
Fellas. Someone ripped this in half.

223
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:11,410
怎么回事 什么
What the fuck? What?

224
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:13,290
怎么回事
What the fuck?

225
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,250
开玩笑吧
You're joking

226
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:19,380
怎么回事
What the fuck?

227
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:43,940
你好
Hello...

(伦敦西汉姆联 必威)

Nathan.

231
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:52,540
谢利

232
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:56,000
很高兴再见到你
Lovely to see you again.

233
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,290
好吧
Okay.

234
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,290
抱歉我最近没常来
Sorry I've not been around much.

235
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:02,670
你没有吗
You haven't?

236
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:06,720
对...我最近很忙 忙我的新工作
No. No, I've been really busy with my new job.

237
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:11,470
十分重要的新工作导致我很忙
Big new job just keeping me very busy.

238
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:15,100
听起来挺蠢的 也许你应该辞掉 你重要 忙碌的新工作
Sounds silly. Maybe you should quit your big new busy job.

239
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,690
总之 我是来拿外卖的
Anyway, just here to pick up my takeaway.

240
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:21,940
我为我的所有员工买了午餐
I bought lunch for my whole staff.

241
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:24,070
除了训练员 因为他们食量如牛
Apart from the trainers, 'cause they eat like cows.

242
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,160
抱歉 这话有点...不是 他们很可...我是说 他们很可爱
Sorry, that sounds-- No, they're love-- I mean, they're lovely people.

243
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,490
他们是素食者
They're just vegetarians.

244
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:32,990
(雅典品味)

245
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,750
不是吧
No way.

246
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:40,960
看看谁大驾光临了 我没看错吧
Look who's here. No fucking way!

247
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:43,840
-你知道这是谁吗  -杰森杰里
- Do you know who this is? - Jason Jelly.

248
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,880
-对 -不对 是“内森谢利”
- That's right. - No, "Nathan Shelley."

249
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,880
对 内森谢利
That's right, Nathan Shelley,

250
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:50,890
西汉姆联的经理 光临我的餐厅
manager of West Ham United, in my restaurant!

251
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:53,760
-重要的一周啊 伙计 -是
- Big week, my guy. - Yep.

252
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:57,810
太重要了 我是戴瑞克 我是这里的经理
Big fucking week. I'm Derek. I'm the manager here.

253

需要什么尽管说
Anything you need, you got it.

254
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:03,570
-好的 -经理之间互相关照
- Okay. - From one manager to another.

255
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,860
是 其实不太一样 但...
Yeah, well, it's not quite the same, but--

256
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,490
这周要对战你的旧球队
Facing your team this week.

257
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:10,410
这是来真的 对吧
That's gotta be hard-core, right?

258
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:13,830
你在媒体上说了他们好多坏话
I mean, you talked a lot of shit about them in the press.

259
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:17,790
-对吧 我喜欢 -抱歉 我能买单吗
- Didn't ya? I loved it. - Sorry, can I pay?

260
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:24,590
不 这顿算我的 我请 好吗
No. This is on me, okay? On me. Understand?

261
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:27,090
这位先生在这里不用花钱
This man's money is no good here.

262
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:31,180
永远别让他花钱 除非是买酒 酒钱必须付啊
Never charge. Except for booze. Gotta charge for booze.

263
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,890
我没订酒 现在是12点30分
I didn't order any booze. It's 12:30.

264
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:37,560
打趴他们 铁锤帮加油
Knock 'em dead. Go Hammers!

265
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:43,940
难以置信 喂 知道这是谁吗
No way. Oi, do you know who this is?

266
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:50,780
好的 拜拜
All right, okay. Bye.

267
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:06,590
卡
And cut!

268
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:08,550
很不错 科林 谢谢你
Lovely, Colin. Thank you.

269
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:11,340
好 下一个是丹尼
All right. Okay, Dani, you're up.

270
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:13,840
我非常紧张
I'm very nervous.

271
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:16,850
不 不用紧张 坐在这里就好 看向镜头
No. Don't be nervous. Look, just sit here. Look into the camera

272
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:18,850
假装你在和老朋友聊天
and pretend you're talking to an old friend.

273
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:20,180
我最老的朋友是哈维尔
My oldest friend is Javiar.

274
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:22,690
很好 你认识哈维尔多久了
Great. How long have you known Javiar?

275
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:26,270
几个月 但他下周就108岁了
Only a couple of months, but he turns 108 years old next week.

276
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:29,610
-就是他了 -是
- Perfect. - Yeah.

277
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:31,820
最后检查
Final checks.

278
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:34,700
谢谢
Thank you.

279
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:38,120
-你好 基莉 -嗨
- Hello, Keeley. - Hi.

280
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:41,910
对 稍微向左边挪一点
Yeah. Just scoot to your left a little bit.

281
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:45,170
对 很好 开始吧 丹尼
Yeah, that's it. Okay, off you go, Dani.

282
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,250
(伴伴 你永远想不到...)

283
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:49,760
你也许不知道我是谁 但我觉得女人最美丽的部分
You may not know who I am, but I think the most beautiful parts of a woman

284
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:51,800
是她的缺点
are her flaws.

285
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:55,800
卡 谢谢 丹尼 下一位
And cut! Thank you, Dani. Next!

286
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,890
好的
Okay.

287
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:02,680
-给你带了咖啡 -是
- Brought you coffee. - Yeah.

288
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,900
-顺利吗  -天啊 太顺利了
- How's it going? - Oh, my God. This is great.

289
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,230
-是吗  -他们好出色
- Yeah? - They're great.

290
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:08,520
我只是...好爱当老大
I just-- I love being the boss.

291
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,610
-为此干杯 是 -干杯
- Cheers to that. Yeah. - Cheers to that.

292
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:11,990
佐豪 你准备好了吗
You ready, Zoreaux?

293
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:14,660
是 但其实我现在叫“范达美”
Yeah, but I actually go by "Van Damme" now.

294
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,700
行 很好 开始 范达美
Okay, great. Action, Van Damme.

295
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,660
你不知道我是谁
You don't know who I am,

296
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:23,370
但我在找一位喜欢在沙滩简短散步的人
but I'm looking for someone who likes short walks on the beach,

297
00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:26,960
这样我们可以把更多时间用来...
so we can spend more time, you know...

298
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:33,720
卡
And cut.

299
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,510
太好了 谢谢 范达美 下一位
Great, thanks, Van Damme. Next!

300
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:40,010
-范达美  -对 我的新名字
- Van Damme? - Yeah. It's my new name.

301
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,220
很酷 为什么
Cool. Why?

302
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:44,100
因为我爱尚格云顿范达美
Because I love Jean-Claude Van Damme,

303
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:46,140
扎瓦说我想怎么叫自己都行
and Zava told me I should be whoever I wanna be.

304
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,610
-好的 酷 -好的 范达美
- Okay, yeah. Cool. - All right, Van Damme.

305
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,320
-回见 兄弟们 -回见
- All right, boys. - Take it easy.

306
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:54,070
他好性感
He's so fucking hot.

307
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,950
-他的背景是什么  -杰米 他很自大的
- What's his story? - Jamie? He's so cocky.

308
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:02,370
但我想到了这个高度 你必须自大
But I guess you have to be at this level.

309
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:04,750
但他只在乎自己
But he only thinks about himself.

310
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,500
至少他以前是
At least, he used to.

311
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:11,040
开玩笑的 不是
Joking. No.

312
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:14,460
但他不为自己的行为 和给别人造成的后果承担责任
But he's not accountable for his actions and what they do to others.

313
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:19,390
他道歉的功夫倒是越来越好了
Except he is getting better at making apologies.

314
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:23,680
但是他只用下半身思考
Still, he only thinks with his dick.

315
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:29,100
不过我觉得他好久没和人交往过了
And yet, I don't think he's seen anyone in ages.

316
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,780
我只是想知道我能否和他睡 宝贝
I just wanna know if I can bang him, babe.

317
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:39,030
不知道呢
I don't know.

318
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:41,580
你大概问他比较合适 毕竟是他的老二
You should probably ask him, it's his dick.

319
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:43,910
很好 可以了 杰米
Cool. Off you go, Jamie.

320
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,840
你们怎么还在这
What are y'all still doing here?

321
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,840
教练 你最好看看这个
Coach, you're gonna wanna watch this.

322
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,130
是那种视频吗
Is it one of them videos

323
00:18:57,130 --> 00:18:59,300
参军的家长在服役很久后回家
of a military parent coming home after a long tour?

324
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:01,600
如果是的话 我晚餐就要 喝自己的眼泪和鼻涕了
'Cause if so, I'm gonna be eating tears and snot for dinner.

325
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,680
不是
Not quite.

326
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:08,140
(摄像头1 更衣室)

327
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:46,890
来了
Here we go.

328
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,070
(摄像头1 经理办公室)

329
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:56,730
这是哪来的
Where'd this come from?

330
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:59,360
这位神人想到调出安保监控录像
This fucking legend thought to pull the security footage

331
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,860
当我们告诉他标志的事时
when we told him about the sign.

332
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,860
当我们告诉他标志的事时
when we told him about the sign.

333
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:02,660
我想你可以让一个人退出记者行业
I guess you can take the boy out of journalism

334
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:04,320
但你永远无法抹杀他内心的记者
but you can't take journalism out of the boy.

335
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,370
是 你把气氛搞砸了 重点是
Right, you fucking ruined it now. The point is,

336
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:08,870
我们寻找的答案揭晓了
the answer we were looking for has arrived.

337
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:10,620
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

338
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:14,040
这样的视频也许能激励球队
A video like this could motivate a team, perhaps.

339
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:19,010
特伦特 谢谢你的帮忙
Thank you for your help, Trent.

340
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:21,800
希望有天年轻的罗伯特瑞福德 会在电影里扮演你
May a young Robert Redford portray you in a film someday.

341
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:23,590
可能是达斯汀霍夫曼
Probably Dustin Hoffman.

342
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:24,850
-晚安 -晚安
- Good night. - Good night.

343
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:28,270

Go home, guys. Get some sleep.

344
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,810

Okay.

345
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:32,560

晚安 教练
Night, Coach.

347
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:42,110
教练
Coach.

348
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:46,030
我之前在想你的靓女困境
I was thinking about your Sassy situation.

349
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:47,580
是
Yeah.

350
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,120
简的姐妹来了
Jane's sister is in town.

351
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,210
-不用了 教练 谢谢 -这是正确答案
- No, thank you, Coach. - That's the right answer.

352
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:07,800
(《独立日报》 拉索对奇迹小子)

353
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:13,100
挑灯夜战啊
Burning the midnight oil, I see.

354
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:16,940
对 抱歉闪到你了
Yeah. Sorry for the smell.

355
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:20,480
被“灯”闪到
The oil burning.

356
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:25,450
你对这周末有信心吗
So, you're feeling confident about this weekend?

357
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:27,780
是 对 我觉得有
Yeah, no, I think so.

358
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:33,210
对 是的 我们会摧毁敌方 对吗
Yeah, no. Go-- Yeah. We're gonna destroy, right?

359
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,210
很好
Good.

360
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:37,420
不 只是 我...
No, it's just, I--

361
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:41,880
我离开后没见过泰德
I just haven't seen Ted since I left and...

362
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:46,010
我们算是不欢而散
We didn't leave on the best of terms and...

363
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,010
我觉得我欠他一句道歉
I feel like I owe him an apology or something.

364
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:52,310
你做了对你来说最好的决定
You did what was best for you.

365
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:54,310
你还能怎么样
What were you meant to do?

366
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:57,020
留在球队 一辈子支持泰德
Hang around, supporting Ted for the rest of your life?

367
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:58,610
我想还是算了吧
I don't think so.

368
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:07,910
你没做错任何事 内森 我保证
You've done nothing wrong, Nathan, I promise you.

369
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:11,540
这份工作是你赢得的
You earned this job.

370
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:16,540
那我见到他时该说什么
Well, so what do I say when I see him?

371
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:19,750
什么都不用说 除了“你好”
You say nothing, apart from "hello."

372
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:23,510
你直视他的眼睛 你和他握手
You look him in the eye. You shake his hand.

373
00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:26,760
然后你打败他
And then you beat him.

374
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:30,850
然后我们去庆祝
And then we go and celebrate.

375
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:33,180

383
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:34,700
嘿
Hey.

384
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:37,040
上夜班 还是在摸鱼
Working late? Or hardly working?

385
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,290
梗好像没说对
Well, I don't think that's how the joke goes.

386
00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:40,500
什么梗
What joke?

387
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:42,790
不用放在心上 你好吗
Never mind. What's up?

388
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:47,630
我真的很想赢这场比赛
I really want to win this one.

389
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,010
我知道
I know.

00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:58,520
一切都好吗
Everything okay?

391
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:06,230
我是一团乱麻吗
Am I a mess?

392
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:07,820
当然了 所以我们才这么合拍
Of course you are. That's why we get along.

393
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:16,370
我也希望能让你别管靓女说什么 但她通常是对的
And I wish I could tell you to ignore Sass, but she's usually right.

394
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,910
看来靓女已经告诉你... 当然了 闺蜜谈话
So, Sassy already told you about the-- Of course. Girl talk.

395
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:22,580
闺蜜谈话
Girl talk.

396
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:28,210
那么 一切都好吗
So, is everything all right?

397
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:31,010
是 我很好
Yeah, I'm good.

405
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,520
(西汉姆联)

406
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,310
(铁人们 加油)

407
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:33,110
(AFC里士满)

408
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:56,890
哎 我看起来精神吗
Oi, do I look all right?

409
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:58,600
当然 为什么这么问
Of course you do. Why?

410
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,010
如果杰克真的出现
Well, if Jack actually shows up,

411
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,010
如果杰克真的出现
Well, if Jack actually shows up,

412
00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:03,270
我希望他认为我看起来神秘而强大
I want him to think that I look mysterious and powerful.

413
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:04,690
充满活力 你知道吗
Dynamic, you know?

414
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:09,570
-所有这些 -你很神秘 强大 充满活力
- All of that. - You are mysterious, powerful and dynamic.

415
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:14,150
糟糕 我好紧张
Shit, I'm nervous.

416
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:17,820
我得去重新画唇线
I think I need to go and reapply my lip liner.

417
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:21,790
-我们在楼上包厢见 -好的

我没换发型
I haven't changed my hair.

422
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:37,130
你也不该换 现在就很完美
Nor should you. It's perfection.

423
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,140
小家伙怎么样
So, how's the little one?

424
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:44,270
对 黛安 她已经会走路了 你能相信吗
Oh, yeah, Diane. She's already walking. Can you believe that?

425
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:47,190
是 在房子里到处流口水和便便
Yeah. Drooling and pooing around the house.

426
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:48,900
有其父必有其女啊
Takes after her father.

427

嘿 今天对我们手下留情啊
Well. Hey, take it easy on us today.

428
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:56,360
这我不能打包票
No promises.

429
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:10,000
该死
Oh, shit.

430
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:22,470
不好意思
Excuse me.

431
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:24,970
我这里有点情况
I've got a bit of a situation here.

432

谢谢 但其实不是这个
Thank you. But it's actually not that.

433
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:36,530
你真是救命恩人
You're a lifesaver!

434
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:39,280
我通常很准时的
Usually I'm like clockwork,

435
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:42,030
但因为最近压力太大了 月经提前来了
but because I've been so stressed, I've come on early.

436
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:46,370
真高兴这是超大码而不是小码的
I'm so happy that it's a super and not a skinny.

437
00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:48,120
小码的到底谁会买啊
Who are those even for?

438
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:51,670
我的阴道又不是在节食 我可是来月经了
It's not like my vagina is on a diet, I'm on my fucking period.

439
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:54,880

天 你好高
Boy, you're tall.

445
00:28:16,610 --> 00:28:18,280
你的爸爸是一棵树吗
Is your dad a tree or something?

446
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:20,280
没 我只是在逗乐子
No, I'm screwing around.

447
00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:23,780
嘿 说到树 你们今天站哪队啊
Hey, speaking of trees, who are y'all rooting for today?

448
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:24,910
西汉姆
West Ham.

449
00:28:25,410 --> 00:28:27,240
是 很合理 对

450
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:36,300
你们先 对 我还要下一层楼

453
00:28:57,570 --> 00:28:59,150

Listen, Ted.

458
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:19,670

I just wanna say that the way I left--

459
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:22,970

461
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:28,060
(西汉姆联 铁器越强)

462
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:30,390
(西汉姆联 炉火越猛)

463
00:29:31,930 --> 00:29:33,390

Good luck.

466
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:46,820
-基莉 是 -她出色极了
- Keeley? Yeah. - She's absolutely fantastic.

467
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:48,370
她来了
Here she is now.

468
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:52,580
-嘿 对 -基莉 这位是杰克丹弗斯
- Hey. Yeah. - Keeley? This is Jack Danvers.

469
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:53,790
你好
Hello.

470
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,130
我好像有东西在你那里
I believe you have something of mine.

471
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:01,670
要命 你是杰克
Oh, fuck. You're Jack?

472
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:05,050
这有点难堪
This is a bit embarrassing.

473
00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:07,890
-不 -对 我们都以为你是男人
- No. - Yeah. We all thought you were a man.

474
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:09,760
对 还有这个啦
Yeah, that too.

475
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:11,470
那谜语是怎么说的来着
It's like that old riddle.

476
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:13,930
-什么谜语  -这个很棘手的
- What riddle? - You know, always a tricky one, this one.

477
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:15,560
一对父子出了车祸
A father and son are in a car wreck.

478
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:19,400
爸爸当场死了 儿子被送到急救室
Dad dies instantly, the son is rushed to an emergency room.

479
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,440
手术医生走进来 说道
A surgeon walks in and says,

480
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,240
“我不能给这个男孩做手术 他是我的儿子”
"I can't operate on this boy. He's my son."

481
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,780
怎么可能
How is it possible?

482
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,120
-因为她是个女人 -她是同性恋
- Because she's a woman. - She's gay.

483
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:30,160
-捐精者 -他处在模拟宇宙里
- Sperm donor. - He lives in a simulation?

484
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:33,700
对 我想这个谜语也有点过时了
Right. Yeah, I guess that's a bit dated now.

485
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,580
那么 我猜“杰克”是“杰奎琳”的昵称
So, I assume "Jack" is short for "Jacqueline," right?

486
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:39,500
不 是我父亲想要男孩的意思
No. It's short for my father wanted a boy.

487
00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:45,720
我去外面坐坐哈 现在去
I'm gonna go and sit down now, outside. Now.

488
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,010
杰克 欢迎你
Jack, welcome.

489
00:30:48,010 --> 00:30:50,600
我们不能带饮料入座
We are not allowed to take drinks to our seats.

490
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:53,060
所以如果你想喝得大醉酩酊 那我们最好现在开喝
So if you want to get plastered, we should probably do that now.

491
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,560
好的
Okay.

492
00:30:55,850 --> 00:30:57,560
你先
Well, after you.

493
00:31:00,770 --> 00:31:02,650
瑞贝卡 你真幽默
You're so funny, Rebecca.

494
00:31:05,150 --> 00:31:07,240
芭芭拉迷上瑞贝卡了
Barbara's obsessed with Rebecca.

495
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:11,330
我希望她不会试图杀了她 然后把她的皮肤做成西服来穿
I hope she doesn't try and kill her and wear her skin as a suit.

496
00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:17,250
搞什么
What the fuck?

497
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:19,170
干杯 今天会很美好
Cheers. It's gonna be a good day.

498
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:21,750
-好了 巴兹 -哎
- All right, Baz. - Oi!

499
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:25,090
这里是里士满球迷酒吧
This is a Richmond pub.

500
00:31:26,170 --> 00:31:27,800
没事的 梅 他是我朋友
It's all right, Mae. He's with me.

501
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,220
滚出去
Get the fuck out!

502
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,850
加油 里士满
Come on, Richmond!

503
00:31:40,850 --> 00:31:43,610
加油 里士满...
Come on, Richmond! Come on, Richmond!

504
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:45,440
今天座无虚席 大家都来看
It's a full house for today's battle

505
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:49,450
西汉姆联和扎瓦效力的AFC里士满对战
between West Ham United and Zava's AFC Richmond.

506
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:53,120
这场胜利会让任一球队跃至联赛头位
A win would take either team to the top spot in the table,

507
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:56,250
挤下榜首的强旅曼城队
knocking mighty Manchester City off number one.

508
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:58,960
克里斯 这应是场 难分伯仲的比赛 有何预测
Should be a tight match, Chris. Any predictions?

509
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,830
我已经不做预测了 阿尔洛
I stopped making predictions, Arlo.

510
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:02,250
因为我从没猜错过
Because I was never wrong.

511
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:05,590
以至于我开始担心是我造成的结局
Got to the point I was worried I was the one making things happen.

512
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:07,010
真有意思
Well, that's interesting.

513
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:08,170
我知道你会这么说
I knew you'd say that.

514
00:32:08,170 --> 00:32:10,680
他们消逝和死去
They fade and die

515
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:14,760
好运无处寻
Fortune's always hiding

516
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:18,520
我找遍各地
I've looked everywhere

517
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:22,440
我一直在吹泡泡
I'm forever blowing bubbles

518
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:26,400
空中的美丽泡泡
Pretty bubbles in the air

519
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:29,110
西汉姆联...
United! United!

520
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:32,160
西汉姆联...
United! United!

521
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,990
西汉姆联...
United! United!

522
00:32:36,370 --> 00:32:37,370
内特
Nate.

523
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:41,120
我们今天享受过程吧
Let's have fun out there today, yeah?

524
00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:09,150
西汉姆联心情不错 拥抱压力
West Ham are quite happy to just soak up the pressure.

525
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:12,650
面对里士满 不冒任何险
Not taking any risks at all against Richmond,

526
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:14,660
在主场迎战这支球队
of all teams, at home.

527
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:18,870
-也是里士满长足进步的证明 -没事 我们没事
- A sign of how far Richmond have come. - It's all right. We're okay.

528
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:20,450
扎瓦真是大威胁
What a threat Zava is.

529
00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:23,830
里士满 右边 跟紧 别怕
Richmond! To the right! Tight! Don't get scared.

530
00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:32,010
依然无比无 多亏了佐豪精彩的救球
And it stays nil-nil, thanks to an amazing save by Zoreaux.

531
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:34,220
-范达美 -范达美
- Van Damme. - Van Damme!

532
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:36,180
听说他现在希望被称为“范达美”
I hear he wants to be called "Van Damme" now.

533
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,100
为什么
Why?

534
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:39,680
很可能得去他的童年找答案了
Well, we'd probably have to dive into his childhood for that answer.

535
00:33:40,930 --> 00:33:44,650
里士满需要关键的传球 才能打破铁锤帮的防守
Richmond need the key pass to unlock the Hammers' defense.

536
00:33:44,650 --> 00:33:45,730
也许就是这一球
That could be the one.

537
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,940
-塔特射中横梁 -不
- Tartt hits the woodwork. - No!

538
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:51,030
-差一点啊 -扎瓦没有人防
- That was close. - Zava was wide open.

539
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,950
给扎瓦
For Zava!

540
00:33:56,820 --> 00:34:00,790
上半场还有两分钟 这场伦敦德比
There'll be two more minutes in the first half of this scoreless,

541
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:02,910
无人得分 但扣人心弦
but pulsating, London derby.

542
00:34:04,370 --> 00:34:07,460
-奥比桑亚拿到球 -不
- Obisanya caught in possession. - No.

543
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:09,670
西汉姆突然发动进攻
And here come West Ham on the break.

544
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:12,380
阿尔曼多接近球门
Armando bearing down on goal.

545
00:34:14,470 --> 00:34:15,630
-好耶 -好
- Yeah! - Yes!

546
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:18,260
进了 就在范达美眼皮底下
And it's there. Right under Van Damme.

547
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:21,220
这位加拿大的守门员显然不像
The Canadian keeper apparently not as unstoppable

548
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:23,100
与他同名的布鲁塞尔肌肉男一般无敌
as the Muscles from Brussels.

549
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:25,980
这话不公平 阿尔洛 没有人能比得上他
That's not fair, Arlo. Nobody is.

550
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:27,940
-我们有经验的 加油 -加油 小伙子们
- We've been here before. Come on. - Come on, lads.

551
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:31,480
就在中场休息前 铁锤帮1比无领先
The Hammers go up 1-nil just before halftime.

552
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:34,030
该死的
Fuck it.

553
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:37,070
好了 各位 加油 拿出实力来结束上半场
All right, guys. Come on, now. Let's end this half strong!

554
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,200
围过来
Huddle.

555
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:40,780
(队长)

556
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:43,950
这是干什么
What's this shit?

557
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,120
不知道
I don't know.

558
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:48,880
-低一点 正确方向 五 -高明
- Lower. Move it right. Five. - Brilliant.

559
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:51,250
-现在 来吧 五 -裁判 快吹哨
- Right now, come on. Five. - Ref, just blow the fucking whistle.

560
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:56,550
西汉姆施压了
West Ham pressing now.

561
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:58,510
-不 -上半场结束前几秒
- No. - A new tactic from the Hammers

562
00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:00,640
铁锤帮发动新战术
in the closing seconds of the first half.

563
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,560
阿尔洛 任何时候开始改变都不晚
It's never too late to change, Arlo.

564
00:35:04,930 --> 00:35:07,810
-不 -该死 去你的 该死的
- No! - Fuck! Fuck you! Fuck!

565
00:35:07,810 --> 00:35:11,020
现在是2比无 天啊
And it's 2-nil. Oh, deary me.

566
00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:16,610
不好意思
Excuse me.

567
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:22,200
这是怎么发生的
How did that happen?

568
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,540
中场休息
We go to halftime.

569
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:27,580
里士满一直控球
Richmond have dominated possession,

570
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:31,750
但突然之间 铁锤帮就2比无领先
but out of absolutely nowhere, it's 2-nil to the Hammers.

571
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:33,630
我们应该有更好的成绩
We don't deserve that.

572
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:35,130
刚是发生了什么
What the fuck just happened?

573
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:36,800
我不知道
I don't know.

574
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,470
嘿 各位 我一会儿就回来 好吗
Hey, fellas. I'll be right back. Okay?

575
00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:42,760
你要去哪
The fuck are you going?

576
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:45,720
-很快的 好吗  -我们要和球队说什么
- I'll just be a minute or two, okay? - What do we tell the team?

577
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:47,060
不知道 给我个惊喜
I don't know. Surprise me.

578
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:55,480
嘿 老大 你下来做什么
Hey, boss. What you doing down here?

579
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:58,650
我只想告诉你 泰德 我相信你
I just wanted to tell you that I believe in you, Ted.

580
00:35:58,650 --> 00:35:59,820
是
Uh-huh?

581
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:02,950
我知道最近我给你很大的压力
And I know that I've been putting an awful lot of pressure on you

582
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:07,790
要在今天赢球 但我只是希望你忘掉那一切
to win today, but I just want you to forget all about that.

583
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:11,580
就做你自己 享受过程
Just be yourself and have fun.

584
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,040
-好的 -是
- Okay. - Yeah.

585
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:16,000
好的 谢谢你
Okay. Well, thank you.

586
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,550
我相信你 泰德
I believe in you, Ted.

587
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:21,890
气氛好凝重
And it's intense.

588
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:26,390
-我得走了 就这样 -你去忙吧
- I better go. All right. - Off you pop.

589
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:32,310
记住 享受过程
Remember, have fun!

590
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,900
对 好兴奋啊
Yes! This is so exciting!

591
00:36:43,370 --> 00:36:44,410
不
No.

592
00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:54,170
这就是你们的惊喜 是吧
This is your surprise, huh?

593
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:57,880
一分钟前他们失魂落魄的 看看他们现在
A minute ago, they were catatonic. Now look at them.

594
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,470
-他们准备好大战一番了 -说实话 泰德 有时这是好事
- They're killers. - Frankly, Ted, sometimes that's good.

595
00:37:09,930 --> 00:37:11,940
(这是世界舞台)

596
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:21,200
天啊 走出隧道的里士满
Oh, my. Richmond coming out of the tunnel

597
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,450
虎视眈眈 充满敌意
with a palpable chip on their shoulder.

598
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:28,200
天啊 球场上气氛真的紧张起来 我觉得下半场一定精彩无比
Wow. A real tension on the pitch. I think we're in for an exciting half.

599
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:31,330
下半场开始 里士满想要强势开头
We begin the second half with Richmond looking for a strong start.

600
00:37:31,330 --> 00:37:33,580
-加油啊 杀了他们 -杀了他们
- Come on, boys. Fucking kill 'em. - Fucking kill 'em.

601
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:34,960
-来吧 -杀
- Here we go! - Kill!

602
00:37:38,250 --> 00:37:40,050
这个铲断很糟
That's an awful tackle.

603
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:41,840
-他如果只吃个黄牌... -该死
- He would be fortunate to escape... - Oh, fuck.

604
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,180
就算走运了
...with just a yellow.

605
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:45,090
这张红牌合情合理 里士满
It's a deserved red, and Richmond

606
00:37:45,090 --> 00:37:48,390
下半场大部分时间将只有十位球员上场
will play almost the entire second half with ten men.

607
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,730
其实他是个很友善的年轻人
He's actually a very sweet young man.

608
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:54,940
西汉姆发起进攻
Here come West Ham.

609
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,190
范达美现在被罚下场了
And now Van Damme has been sent off.

610
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:02,780
-我们踢得像意大利球队似的 -就是啊
- We're playing like Italians. - I know.

611
00:38:03,530 --> 00:38:04,450
棒极了
It's awesome.

612
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,910
老天
Oh, dear.

613
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:22,840
场上有点剑拔弩张了
It's getting a touch spicy out there.

614
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:26,130
阿尔洛 剑拔弩张 应该说是枪炮齐上阵
Spicy, Arlo? This is vintage vindaloo.

615
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:29,430
不
No.

616
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:45,780
蒙特劳失去理智了 里士满失去了第三位球员
Montlaur has lost his mind, and Richmond have lost a third player.

617
00:38:55,290 --> 00:38:57,000
逗我呢吧
Fucking come on.

618
00:38:57,580 --> 00:39:00,590
里士满完全失控了
Richmond have completely lost the plot.

619
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:05,130
扎瓦一定在想自己做了什么 被困在这样的局面里
Zava must be wondering what he's done to deserve this.

620
00:39:06,130 --> 00:39:08,220
(下半场 西汉姆联4 里士满1)

621
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:11,600
好
Yes!

622
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:14,100
4比1 铁锤帮获胜
And it's 4-1 to the Hammers.

623
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:17,020
这场比赛从不相伯仲变成了天平一边倒
It went from evenly matched to unevenly matched

624
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:21,060
然后演化为点燃一罐汽油的混乱
to light a match on fire and put it into a can of petrol.

625
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:23,480
下半场应该附带可能引起不适的警告
That second half should've come with a trigger warning.

626
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:27,820
扎瓦的非凡进球 也没有减轻观看这场比赛的痛苦
One extraordinary goal by Zava did not make it any less tough to watch.

627
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:31,490
里士满展现了我们前所未见的一面
Richmond showed a side of themselves we've never seen before.

628
00:39:31,490 --> 00:39:34,080
他们踢得愤怒 卑鄙和丑陋
They played angry, dirty and ugly.

629
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:37,120
这也是扎瓦最小的三个孩子的名字
Which are also the names of Zava's three youngest kids.

630
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:39,210
要命
Shit.

631
00:39:41,790 --> 00:39:42,790
要命
Shit.

632
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:45,130
要命
Shit.

633
00:39:45,130 --> 00:39:47,260
-嘿 没事的 -要命
- Hey, it's okay. - Shit.

634
00:39:52,050 --> 00:39:53,310
你们看得开心吗
Did you guys have fun?

635
00:39:53,310 --> 00:39:54,390
是
Yeah.

636
00:39:54,390 --> 00:39:57,430
暴力挺有娱乐性的 对吧 从某方面来说
The violence was quite entertaining, wasn't it? In a way.

637
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:07,320
罚范达美下场是个错误
Sending off Van Damme was a mistake.

638
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:09,320
他充满激情
He played with passion.

639
00:40:10,530 --> 00:40:13,080
“激情”这种词是用来形容爱的
"Passion" is a word we use when we talk about love.

640
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:17,960
也是用来形容犯罪的
It is also a word we use to describe a crime.

641
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:21,210
有时也是一种水果
Sometimes it is also a fruit.

642
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:27,090
天啊 真抱歉
Oh, gosh. I'm so sorry.

643
00:40:27,090 --> 00:40:28,170
(主席包厢)

644
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:51,360
-我们搞砸了 -我们矫枉过正 带着恨意踢球
- We fucked up. - We overcorrected and played with hate.

645
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,950
-希望你可以吼吼我们 -拜托了
- Be great if you yelled at us a bit. - Please.

646
00:40:58,750 --> 00:41:01,170
-骂我们是坨屎什么的 -现在就骂
- Call us pieces of shit or something. - Now.

647
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:03,880
你可以揍我们
You can hit us.

648
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,130
把这事儿翻篇
Get it over with.

649
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,010
试了新的方法 不奏效 没什么大不了
Tried something new. It didn't work. Big whoop.

650
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:13,430
但是那个U盘在你们谁那里 给我吧
I will take that thumb drive one of y'all's got.

651
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:25,310
忘了这事吧 两位 赛季还有很多场比赛
Shake it off, fellas. Lot of football left this season.

652
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,490
-真是个混蛋 -没错
- What a fucking arsehole. - I know.

653
00:41:31,490 --> 00:41:34,450
赢了这场比赛 你一定感到很开心吧
You have to feel pretty good about yourself after that win, yeah?

654
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:36,780
是 里士满显然被扰乱了
Well, yeah. Richmond were clearly rattled.

655
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:39,830
说实话 赢得比我想象中容易
It was easier than I expected, if I'm honest.

656
00:41:40,370 --> 00:41:41,370
泰德呢
What about Ted?

657
00:41:41,370 --> 00:41:44,250
比赛结束时不和他握手 有点自大啊
Quite a snub not to shake his hand at the end of the game.

658
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:48,840
我没握手吗 我不是故意的
Did I not? I didn't mean to.

659
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:53,090
我...也许我当时太激动了
I-- Guess I just got caught up in the excitement of it all. Yeah.

660
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:56,180
失陪一下 我...
Excuse me a minute. I just...

661
00:42:08,570 --> 00:42:11,320
谢利教练 曼尼昂先生让我给你这个
Coach Shelley, Mr. Mannion asked me to give you this.

662
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:13,150
(骨头与蜜糖 贵宾通行证)

663
00:42:13,150 --> 00:42:14,700
他一小时后和你在那里见面
He'll meet you there in an hour.

664
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:18,660
谢...
Thank--

665
00:42:36,390 --> 00:42:39,010
-瑞贝卡 见到你真好 -贝克丝 彼此彼此
- It's so good to see you, Rebecca. - You too, Bex.

666
00:42:39,010 --> 00:42:40,970
瑞贝卡 亲爱的
Oh, Rebecca, my dear.

667
00:42:40,970 --> 00:42:44,730
-很遗憾你输球了 -谢谢
- So sorry for your loss. - Thank you.

668
00:42:44,730 --> 00:42:47,150
走吧 老头 你的睡觉时间早过了
Come on, old man. It's way past your bedtime.

669
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,360
见到你很开心
Lovely to see you.

670
00:42:53,690 --> 00:42:55,280
我看到你和你的助理在一起了
I saw you with your assistant.

671
00:42:56,660 --> 00:42:58,910
你的女儿不应承受这个 贝克丝也是
Your daughter deserves better, and so does Bex.

672
00:42:59,990 --> 00:43:01,240
别再到处乱搞了
Stop fucking around.

673
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
你的

是的
No.

677
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:23,850

肯定和自我简介页面的变动有关
Pretty sure the change to the bio line helped.

“当学生准备好时 老师就会出现
"When the student is ready, the teacher will appear.

this whole thing with you and Dr. Jacob really ticks me off.

730

在你们开始前 我们没有真正聊过这件事
And I'm upset that we didn't ever really get to talk about it

737
00:47:29,970 --> 00:47:31,600
那也不对
Well, wouldn't be the right thing either.
