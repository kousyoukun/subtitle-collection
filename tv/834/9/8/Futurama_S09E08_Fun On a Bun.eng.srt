Crew, you're working too hard.

Tell me about it.

8
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:46,421
For once, I thought it might be nice
to do something in a social setting,

9
00:00:46,505 --> 00:00:48,507
finally get to know each other.

You, boy. What do they call you?

12
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:56,014
Most folks just call me Orange Joe.

13
00:00:56,098 --> 00:00:57,975

Where's Oktoberfest?

00:01:29,256 --> 00:01:31,216
This is Oktoberfest,

the world's most sophisticated exhibition

24
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,138

Care for another, sir?

No, I wouldn't want to ruin my Oktoberfest

What the hell is going on here?

29

Oktoberfest is a classy celebration

Hey, Elzar, I've just recently started
always having dreamt of being

a sausage-making champion.
Can I get in on this?

45
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:37,449

You bring your ingredients?

You gotta get innovative with your meat.

See Chef Fritz over there?

51
00:02:47,751 --> 00:02:50,671
He's only using the choicest cuts
of hummingbird.

52
00:02:50,754 --> 00:02:54,591
Murakami-san got his hands
on a nice rack of angel wings.

53
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:56,635
Gonna grind 'em up into Heavenwurst.

54
00:02:56,969 --> 00:03:00,848
And me? I'm making my
spice-weaseled bratwurst out of pork.

55
