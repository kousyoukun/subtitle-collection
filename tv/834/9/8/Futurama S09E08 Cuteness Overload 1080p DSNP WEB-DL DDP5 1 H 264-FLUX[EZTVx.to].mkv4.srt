天啊...天啊!

9
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:53,470
{\an8}我帮臭臭换尿布,你帮挑剔鬼准备早餐

10
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:54,846
{\an8}我不是挑剔鬼

11
00:00:55,513 --> 00:00:58,600
{\an8}好恶心,我的蛋里面有蛋白

12
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:03,646
{\an8}- 快穿好衣服,曼蒂
- 这是小孩的衣服,妈

13
00:01:03,646 --> 00:01:05,190
{\an8}我才不要穿

14
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:06,399
{\an8}我也不要

15
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:11,613
{\an8}好恶心喔!他的尿布沾到蛋白

{\an8}(行星快递)

17
00:01:14,824 --> 00:01:17,285
{\an8}我不懂我的小孩为什么这么骄纵

18
00:01:17,285 --> 00:01:18,578
{\an8}我们有很多钱

19
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:22,457
{\an8}他们想要什么就给他们什么
他们还是十分骄纵

20
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:25,418
{\an8}应该让你的孩子看看
我是怎么在孤儿院长大的

21
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:29,631
{\an8}我们只能幻想怎么骄纵和不讨喜

22
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:31,508
{\an8}是吗?

23
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:36,096
{\an8}孤儿院允许参观吗?

24
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:38,264
{\an8}这样就能让访客自我感觉良好

25
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:40,141
{\an8}还能吓唬自己的孩子?

26
00:01:40,141 --> 00:01:42,685
{\an8}当然,这就叫“志工服务”

27
00:01:42,685 --> 00:01:47,398
{\an8}(饼干村最低安全级别孤儿院)

28
00:01:47,982 --> 00:01:50,902
好𫫇,这里的味道比曼蒂还臭

29
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:52,237
才没有

30
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:56,366
我认为志工服务是很棒的主意

31
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:58,368
我绝对不会为了其他事而错过

32
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:02,080
克洛克中尉!紧急简报会议,立刻报到

33
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,164
谢天谢地

34
00:02:03,164 --> 00:02:04,874
我一个月后回来

莉拉

37
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:17,428
仿佛才是昨天的事
你还这么高,还罹患坏血病

38
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:20,515
好多凄惨的回忆

39
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:22,976
这是要收养我的新家庭吗?

40
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:24,352
不是,艾伯特

41
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:28,940
这群人来这里是为了提供
没用又不须技能的劳力,不是收养你

42
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,275
谢天谢地

43
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:34,821
准备好参加亲自动手的超有趣志工工作

44
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:38,199
但别碰任何东西

45
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:41,619
点心时间到了
所以你们可以先把这些葡萄切成两半

46
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:43,955
这样小孩就不会噎到

47
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:45,999
不是,这样才有足够的葡萄分给大家

48
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:49,752
接下来,剪毯子

49
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:56,426
这汤闻起来很美味
我可以帮忙上菜顺便喝这好喝的汤吗?

50
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:58,970
你要先把汤煮出来,那只是自来水

51
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:02,891
料多味美

52
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:07,896
我该把这腐烂的垃圾拿出去吗?

53
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:11,900
那不是垃圾,是捐赠桶
让捐赠者丢他们的垃圾用的

54
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,610
好,孩子们排队

55
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:19,282
每个孩子会领到正好0.6公斤的玩具

56
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:21,910
你拿到三分之二的篮球

57
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:24,829
你拿到一堆融化的军人

58
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:28,416
你拿到三个沾到番茄酱的毛绒玩具

59
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:31,628
你拿到三轮...双轮脚踏车

60
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:34,005
- 艾伯特,你拿到饼干
- 好吃

61
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:41,221
这是我以前的房间,唯一一间有窗户的

62
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:45,558
那是班迪,他害我第一次得狂犬病

63
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:49,562
这比我家里的房间要好太多了

64
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:53,900
我的房间有太多家具
而且风格都太搭了

65
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:57,904
而且她的玩具有好多酱汁!

66
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:59,739
我的玩具都没有!

67
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:02,951
你想让我踹她吗?

68
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:07,622
(食堂)

69
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:08,623
来

70
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:11,960
这盘给你

71
00:04:13,544 --> 00:04:14,671
这盘给你

72
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,634
帮忙的感觉真好

73
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:22,804
你能帮我们修桌子吗?闪亮裤子先生

74
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:24,347
我以为你们永远都不会问

75
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:27,350
耶

76
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,686
你能帮我把弯曲的汤匙弄直吗?

77
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:30,979
没问题,孩子

78
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:33,564
你是怎么弄弯的?

79
00:04:33,564 --> 00:04:36,192
丹明弄的,用意念弄弯的

80
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:40,571
厉害,丹明

81
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:46,244
{\an8}我很抱歉,孩子们,那太可怕了

82
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:48,705
为了弥补,我会买下所有小马给你们

83
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:50,290
最好买大的给我

84
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:52,500
曼蒂在哪?

85
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,921
我喜欢这里

86
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:03,761
想玩玩具吗?

87
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:07,015
浣熊舔掉了一些意大利面酱

88
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:09,976
真可爱

89
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:12,937
嗨!我叫熊丽娜

90
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:14,897
我喜欢你的耳朵

91
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:18,818
我喜欢你光秃秃的前额

92
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:23,489
你是小绿蛙,跟我爸爸好像

93
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:28,536
曼蒂,不要亲垃圾

94
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:30,330
但我们玩得很开心

95
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,123
来,该回去了

96
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:34,751
我可以至少给她一个抱抱道别吗?

97
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:36,878
我说过不要碰任何脏东西

简报会议报到,长官

100
00:05:47,638 --> 00:05:52,352
你知道,基夫,在某些女性中
我以脱衣更出名

101
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,106
稍息,先生

102
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:01,652
艾米瑞拉?还穿著作战服?

103
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:03,112
一定是有要事

104
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:04,697
很重要,中尉

105
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:06,949
我接下来要让你们看的是最高机密

106
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:09,577
所以我一直贴身藏着

107
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:13,998
我应该要帮艾米买这种地图装

108
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:18,586
身份不明的敌对外星人
摧毁了我们几个偏远基地

109
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:20,713
这里、这里和这里

110
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:22,673
我去过其中两个基地

111
00:06:22,673 --> 00:06:26,886
他们正直接前往...我不能擅自透露

112
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:29,389
不过是行星民主秩序最重要的行星

113
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:32,183
不是我的家乡两栖九号星吧?

114
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:39,357
重要的意思是地球,中尉

115
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:42,735
地球的生存岌岌可危

116
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:45,279
呸,两栖九号星

117
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:57,583
那些孤儿确实教会我们
很多关于不要骄纵的道理

118
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:58,626
对吧?孩子们

119
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:03,256
这是国产浴盐吗?
我们家怎么了?破产了吗?

120
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:06,676
我想念莎莉,还有她的毛毛玩具

121
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:09,429
我会买新的毛毛玩具给你

122
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,180
我相信这种玩具到处都找得到

123
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,765
(毛茸茸乐乐包)
(一定要全都收集)

124
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:13,891
售完?

125
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:14,892
(玩具,售完)

126
00:07:14,892 --> 00:07:16,727
售完?

127
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:19,730
在那里

128
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:23,609
- 我的!
- 喂

129
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:26,863
别碰我的东东!
这是我要送给那个谁的礼物

130
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:29,782
你的那个谁年纪太大,不能玩东东

131
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:36,497
看来这里有个毛茸茸乐乐包的小收藏家

132
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:38,040
有人在收集这些东西?

133
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,208
天啊,有

134
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:42,086
自从我买到第一个开始,我就...

135
00:07:42,086 --> 00:07:44,547
一定要全部收集

136
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:46,757
{\an8}一定要全部收集

137
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:49,802
现在我知道很难买到,我就想要

138
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:53,806
好了,我收集全部了

139
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:57,310
亲爱的,你还差得远了

140
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,436
(毛乐-收集全部两百个)

141
00:07:58,436 --> 00:08:01,981
- 你还要收集195个
- 唉呀,那我最好立刻开始

142
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:04,692
- 喂!
- 成熟点

143
00:08:08,946 --> 00:08:11,616
贝贝湾有咬咬臭虫上架了!

144
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:15,661
- 商业新闻...
- 关电视

145
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:19,165
...毛茸茸乐乐包指数
今天创下历史新高,因为...

146
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:20,541
开电视

147
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:24,795
专家们一致认为
量产的乐乐包只会升值

148
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:26,756
就像比特币或郁金香

149
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:28,966
一定要收集全部

150
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:30,760
(旧物出售)

151
00:08:42,271 --> 00:08:44,148
(3024年毛茸茸展)

152
00:08:48,152 --> 00:08:49,195
(怀孕猫)

153
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:50,279
还剩一个

154
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:54,408
腰果抱抱鱼,我会努力收集到你

155
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:57,912
(毛乐)

156
00:08:57,912 --> 00:08:59,580
生意真是兴隆

157
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:02,500
我们正运送好几百万个这种东西!

158
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,754
这个,抱抱鱼,有人看到吗?

159
00:09:06,754 --> 00:09:10,132
你好像很激动,艾米,不过这超可爱

160
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:11,634
把那张图给我

161
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:15,972
在可爱的概念背后

162
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:18,266
其实是相当有科学根据的

163
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:20,726
上课啰!

164
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:25,523
由于哺乳动物幼崽在出生时
眼睛相对较大

165
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:30,027
我们进化到发现这种特征很可爱
所以会照顾我们的后代

166
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:31,779
而不是勒死他们

167
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:33,906
真是精明的小混蛋

168
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:36,200
我们来做个实验

169
00:09:37,868 --> 00:09:39,996
我会展示一系列图案

170
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:45,084
我的可爱音量仪会测量
你们喊“噢”的声音有多大

171
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:47,169
噢!

172
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:49,547
噢!

173
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:52,216
噢!

174
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:54,552
- 恶心
- 好𫫇

175
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:58,472
没错,这张脸的可爱系数是零

176
00:09:58,472 --> 00:10:01,559
针孔般的瞳孔丑陋且令人厌恶

177
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:03,060
关掉啦

178
00:10:03,185 --> 00:10:07,148
但这些乐乐包把可爱提升到新的境界

179
00:10:07,898 --> 00:10:10,192
噢!

180
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:14,864
我们想得到这些玩具的欲望
超出了我们的控制范围

181
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:17,575
我不知道是不是真的超出...

182
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:20,328
有个抱抱鱼要拍卖了!

183
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:28,169
{\an8}你们就偷溜进去假装是孤儿
等我回来为止

184
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:29,795
快去

185
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:33,507
(下奇广告)
(拍卖商)

186
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:40,389
你有自己的竞标号码牌?

187
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:42,725
我有自己的号码

188
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:46,520
现在开始竞标所有乐乐包中
最稀有、最可爱的

189
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,397
腰果抱抱鱼

190
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:53,069
我出我小孩的所有大学基金

191
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:57,657
女士,这出价十分合理

192
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,659
有人出十分合理的价格

193
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:02,244
有人出价比十分合理多一半吗?

194
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:06,290
有人出价比十分合理多一半

195
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:08,751
有人出小妞开什么玩笑的价格吗?

196
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:13,047
你只活一次,母亲,虽然已经活很久了

197
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:15,383
小妞,开什么玩笑?

198
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:18,552
反对!停止竞标

199
00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:20,513
这个乐乐包是假的

200
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:22,264
什么?

201
00:11:22,264 --> 00:11:26,310
请注意下缝处的颜色比该有的颜色稍浅

202
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:28,896
标签上写的应该是“腰果抱抱鱼”

203
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:31,732
但上面写的是“冒牌假鱼”

204
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:36,445
你是专业的乐乐包鉴价师
你之前怎么没注意到这一点?

205
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:39,532
坦白说,我之前被它的可爱分散注意力

206
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:43,661
有人见过真正的抱抱鱼吗?

207
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:45,162
也许这款玩具不存在

208
00:11:45,162 --> 00:11:48,708
也许这只是某种恶心
乱七八糟的游戏!

209
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,376
好了,冷静

210
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:53,546
记得吧,王小姐,你有小孩抱过

211
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,381
谁?对喔!

212
00:11:57,007 --> 00:11:59,051
那片污渍看起来像发霉的兔子

213
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:01,303
那个看起来像蟑螂

214
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:03,472
跑掉了

215
00:12:03,597 --> 00:12:05,141
我们来玩乐乐包

216
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:08,436
来,曼蒂

217
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:11,522
我们回家洗个澡,然后烧掉那些衣服

218
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:26,370
真是有趣的小玩具

219
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:29,790
是吗?哪里有趣?

220
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,792
其实没什么

221
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:34,628
只是交换很好玩,对吧?

222
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:36,589
你干嘛阴阳怪气的?妈

223
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,716
我没有阴阳怪气

224
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:40,217
去车上等我

225
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:44,847
那个好脏

226
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:47,600
你不想要干净一点的玩具吗?

227
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,812
不要,我喜欢脏一点的,跟我很搭

228
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:55,357
但这个紫色的狮子有点少见

229
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:59,320
我会给你一整袋黄金变种抱抱鲸

230
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:03,199
- 你想要可以拿去
- 成交

231
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:06,160
(BP-1729)

232
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:10,372
正接近莫维纳六号星前哨站
最近一个全军覆没的基地

233
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:15,461
我有一种奇怪的感觉,基夫
把紧张等级设定到最高

234
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:19,423
(紧张等级)
(最低-最高)

235
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:21,258
(莫维纳六号星前哨基地)

236
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:27,348
老天爷啊!

237
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:28,849
太恐怖了

238
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:30,768
你先进去,基夫

239
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:32,520
(行星民主秩序)

240
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:35,523
他们的气管和胸腔都被压碎

241
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:38,692
他们就像被拥抱窒息而死!

242
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:40,402
看一下监视器影片

243
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:43,614
上一个进入这里的人一定是凶手

244
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:45,574
{\an8}(2号监视器)

245
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:48,244
{\an8}(5号监视器)

246
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:50,996
{\an8}那是艾米的老板的快递飞船!

247
00:13:57,503 --> 00:14:00,631
他们只是来送货并偷了一些东西
没有造成危害

248
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:02,174
没有什么违法的行为

249
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:07,680
那艘飞船上一定藏有某种怪物

250
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,932
然后大开杀戒

251
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:11,517
全数歼灭

252
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:15,813
你觉得它还在这里吗?
或是可能已经前往地球?

253
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:18,357
我不认为,快逃啊

254
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:22,236
希望艾米和孩子们没事

255
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:28,492
出差不能不带可爱的礼物回去

256
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:34,498
所以经过长时间的草率考虑

257
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:38,377
你们的退休金
现已全部投资在毛茸茸乐乐包里

258
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:39,545
真是深谋远虑

259
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:43,465
这里有外星人入侵吗?

260
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:47,970
- 有条子
- 莫维纳六号星前哨站被某怪物消灭了

261
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,722
但我们才刚去过那里

262
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:53,142
他们有一个珍贵的花瓶,跟这个很像

263
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:56,854
你们的货舱中
可能藏着难以想像的恐怖怪物

264
00:14:56,854 --> 00:14:58,147
你们当时送什么东西过去?

265
00:14:58,147 --> 00:15:01,483
我们现在只送一种东西到各地
毛茸茸乐乐包

266
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:02,484
像那种

267
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:05,529
跟这个一样?

268
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:08,032
我看一下那个乐乐包

269
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:12,494
解剖刀

270
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:19,585
- 天啊
- 什么?里面是什么?

271
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:22,880
小塑胶珠,或豆豆

272
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,591
不然你以为是什么?那是豆豆包

273
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:31,472
这不是豆豆,是活物

274
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:33,933
- 豆豆不是活的吗?
- 闭嘴,呆瓜

275
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:43,901
这整个有机体充满孢子

276
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:47,404
这基本就是一个大型生殖器官

277
00:15:47,404 --> 00:15:49,782
就像某些人类吧?莉拉

278
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:54,578
这些小乐乐包
有可能造成这么大的破坏吗?

279
00:15:54,578 --> 00:15:58,248
不是它们主动的,不是,它们没有脑子

280
00:15:58,248 --> 00:16:02,252
就像某些人类吧?莉拉,不对,慢著

281
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:05,965
必须是某种恶意变种对它们下命令

282
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:10,177
一个十分不寻常的变种
具有恶魔般的智慧

283
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:12,721
乐乐包老大

284
00:16:14,431 --> 00:16:18,394
我收集到了,世上最稀有的一个

285
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:22,523
跟一个小孤女敲诈来的

286
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:25,442
我真是个烂人

287
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:37,413
所以这些乐乐包在入侵地球?
这怎么可能?

288
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:40,874
可爱是一种绝妙的进化策略

289
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,962
它们打造不出太空船
连自己的架子都无法打造

290
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:47,756
- 鲁蛇
- 但它们不需要

291
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:50,801
它们进化到令人无法抗拒的可爱

292
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:54,346
所以除了我以外的所有傻瓜
都会收集它们

293
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:57,725
这是一场我们自己买下入侵者

294
00:16:57,725 --> 00:17:00,019
把它们带回自己家中的侵略

295
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,895
就像我的黑霉菌奇亚籽宠物吗?

296
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:07,151
- 它们的首领长怎样?
- 乐乐包老大吗?

297
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:10,821
不会是长相普通的,例如酸辣酱花栗鼠

298
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:13,323
或绝迹黑犀牛

299
00:17:13,323 --> 00:17:16,577
不是,会是稀有且昂贵的

300
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:21,540
仅限顶级收藏家的收藏范围
例如我或艾米

301
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:23,876
或艾米?

302
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:32,968
曼蒂,妈妈做错事了,现在要去弥补

303
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:36,221
你是说抛下我们几个星期
跑去买玩具吗?

304
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:38,599
不是,但那也是错的

305
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:41,018
拿去,艾伯特

306
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:43,437
这是给你的,妮娜

307
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:46,982
还有没有多一个给院长
放在他那空荡荡的架子?

308
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:48,776
和他的心?

309
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:50,319
当然有

310
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:51,945
尽情玩吧,孩子们

311
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:55,491
我把我所有收藏送给孤儿院

312
00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:03,040
我回来了

313
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:07,711
曼蒂!我好害怕我再也见不到你!

314
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:12,466
莎莉,我做了错事,拿走你特别的玩具

315
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:16,595
这玩具稀有又宝贵,是属于你的

316
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:20,557
没关系,你可以拿去
我更喜欢你给我的这个

317
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:23,811
那个任何人都能买到的
便宜又普通的玩具?

318
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:26,480
- 你疯了吗?
- 这对我来说很特别

319
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,900
因为这是第一次有个妈妈送我礼物

320
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:33,987
拜托,拿回去

321
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:37,241
从某种大人的角度来说,这对你很重要

322
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:39,576
但对我来说,这只是玩具

323
00:18:39,576 --> 00:18:42,246
但玩具用来玩才是最重要的

324
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:44,581
就拿去,开心玩吧

325
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:50,170
不,只有跟同伴一起玩才开心
尤其是跟曼蒂

326
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:52,464
她可以继续跟我玩吗?

327
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:57,219
只要你愿意,你和曼蒂都能一起玩

328
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:58,512
那好吧

329
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:04,143
妈妈,你没放手

330
00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:09,356
你会没事的,那只是个玩具

331
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:11,942
我们来抱抱

332
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:26,874
行星民主秩序,嘟...嘟

333
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:35,841
救命!它在紧抱我的脖子

334
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:41,555
不要怕,基夫,帮他脱困

335
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:51,815
老天爷

336
00:19:51,815 --> 00:19:55,986
乐乐包爆炸时,会触发豆豆孵化

337
00:19:55,986 --> 00:20:00,407
- 那我们要怎么消灭它们?
- 当然是用我的杀猴桶

338
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:03,076
只要把乐乐包放进去...

339
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:09,166
你们遇到对手了
动不了的毛绒小动物!

340
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:14,963
我办不到,这太可爱了

341
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:17,299
别荒谬了,给我

342
00:20:21,261 --> 00:20:24,348
- 可恶
- 这太可爱了,连我都沦陷

343
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:26,558
我还认为班比的妈妈活该

344
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:29,937
没用,我们全军覆没

345
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:32,606
- 基夫,救命
- 艾米

346
00:20:39,112 --> 00:20:40,739
抱抱阵行

347
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:44,159
前进,抱抱

348
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:48,413
我好怕,妈妈,我要抱抱

349
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:51,708
不行,曼蒂,你想做什么都行
就是不能抱抱

350
00:20:56,505 --> 00:21:00,759
我们绝对不能释放孢子
所以不要朝任何东西开枪

351
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:04,513
我怎么可能开枪?
它们的眼睛这么大,这么可爱

352
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:09,226
那双细小的针眼瞳孔

353
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:26,618
艾米,我可能赶不过去

354
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:29,371
你必须杀掉乐乐包老大

355
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:31,039
什么包老大?

356
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:33,250
那个首领!

357
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:39,423
够了,谁都不能把基夫抱死,除了我

358
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:42,426

Cashew CuddleFish,
I'm gonna collect you so hard!

these things are by the millions!

00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:06,755
This one, the CuddleFish!
Has anyone seen it?

173
00:09:06,755 --> 00:09:10,133
You seem worked up, Amy.
Though it is awful cute.

174
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:11,635
Gimme that drawing!

00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,178
[both grunting]

176
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:15,973
You know, there's actually quite
a bit of science

177
00:09:15,973 --> 00:09:18,267
behind the concept of cuteness.

178
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:20,727
Ooh! Lecture! Lecture!

179
00:09:21,353 --> 00:09:25,524
Since baby mammals have relatively
large eyes at birth,

180
00:09:25,524 --> 00:09:30,028
we evolved to find that cute,
so we'd care for our offspring

181
00:09:30,028 --> 00:09:31,780
instead of strangling them.

182
00:09:32,406 --> 00:09:33,907
Clever little bastards.

183
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:36,201
Let's run an experiment.

184
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:39,997
I'm going to show a series of images,

185
00:09:39,997 --> 00:09:45,085
and my cu-trometer will measure
how loud you say "Aw."

186
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:47,171
[all] Aw!

187
00:09:48,046 --> 00:09:49,548

- Ew!
- Yuck!

190
00:09:54,553 --> 00:09:58,473
Correct. This face
has zero cuteness coefficient.

191
00:09:58,473 --> 00:10:01,560
The pinprick pupils
are ugly and off-putting.

192
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,061
Turn it off! Turn it off!

193
00:10:03,187 --> 00:10:07,149
But these Funbags,
why, they take it to the next level.

[all] Aw!

195

"Cashew CuddleFish,"

223
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:31,733
the tag reads "Knockoff Phonyfish."

No, wait.
