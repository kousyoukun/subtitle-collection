..had have told the world

I did tell you.

193
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,919
RACHEL: I know
Miki argued with Hugh on the day,

194
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,319
but it's...

195
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:34,720
..it's just not as strong
as I'd like, for a motive.

196
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:38,319
Maybe Hugh went after HER.

197
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,799
I mean, he wasn't
in the best of health, but still,

198
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,440
he was a big bloke.

199
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,679
Could be self-defence.

200
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,679
What, and then...

201
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,039
..Miki keeps quiet about it

202
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,199
'cause she figured
no-one would believe her?

203
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,640
Dare say she'd be right about that.

204
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:58,479
Well, that would mean
Lynne was lying about that alibi.

205
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,759

I suppose.

00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,560
RACHEL: Yeah.

214
00:14:17,561 --> 00:14:18,919
That's odd.

215
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,519
I'll dig it up.

00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,000
Great. Thanks.

217
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:27,759
Well, for starters, interfering with
evidence in a murder investigation

218
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:31,399
is enough all by itself
to get you sent back to prison, so...

219
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,239
You don't need to say anything, OK?

220
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,240
Just let me do the talking.

221
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:40,479
Miki had no way of knowing it was
the murder weapon in her locker.

222
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,919
And until Forensics confirms it,
neither do you.

223
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:47,719
So we're talking about a knife
found in a meatworks. That's all.

224
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:51,439
Uh, a knife with
a cracked handle and a broken tip.

225
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,639
Now, I'd say the chances of...

226
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,799
She could have just as easily
thrown it in the river.

227
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,759
Then you never would have found it.

228
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,719
Why didn't you?

229
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,919
Because it could be evidence.

230
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,919
I am trying to help you
find Hugh's killer.

231
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:06,679
Much appreciated, but I...
I think we'll manage on our own.

232
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:09,639
This anonymous text
that tipped you off...

233
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,600
Yeah.
..any theory on who that was?

234
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:16,279
I thought it was Adam
trying to set me up.

235
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,680
But if it is the real knife...
Miki. Please.

236
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,999
The text was sent from the public
phone booth in the centre of town.

237
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,119
So whoever sent the text
is the one framing her

238
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,239
and most likely the murderer.

239
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,759
That's one possibility. Yeah.

240
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:32,959
BILL: Or someone saw Miki
put the knife in her locker

241
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,519
and did the right thing.

242
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,999
Even if that knife
is the murder weapon,

243
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,999
and even if you find
Miki's DNA on it,

244
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,839
it's all circumstantial.

245
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,759
You don't have a witness.
You don't have a motive.

246
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:47,599
And, as I understand it,
my client has an alibi.

247
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,079
Now, even an estate lawyer
from a country town can see

248
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:53,400
you do not have enough
to charge her with anything.

(SIGHS)

250
00:16:03,441 --> 00:16:06,119
Forensics on the knife
will take a while.

251
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,119
Even with the rush job.

252
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:11,919
I say we hold her
on parole violations until then.

253
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,239
Yeah, but if she killed Hugh Lang,

254
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,119
why pull a stupid stunt
like last night?

255
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,399
Who knows what goes on in her head?

256
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,799
She's got half the town
baying for her blood.

257
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,839
Yeah.

258
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:24,560
From what I hear, the other half
is randy blokes wanting a go.

259
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,199
Get anything from the phone booth?

260
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,479
Bugger-all.
RACHEL: Mmm.

261

A mishmash of partial prints.

262
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,919
Most of them would belong
to local druggies.

263
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:40,559
Yeah, but they didn't CALL
the station. They texted YOUR mobile.

264
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,439
Everyone around here has my number.
It's easy.

265
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,199
Still, phone booth's on the main
street, just outside the op shop.

266
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,999
Maybe someone saw something.

267
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,119
BILL: Alright.
Mm-hm.

268
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:52,720
I'll ask around.
RACHEL: Or CCTV?

269
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:57,399
You really think
they don't have enough to charge me?

270
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,199
Well...

271
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,080
..looks that way to me.

272
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,880
Why are you helping me?

273
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,999
The truth?

274
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,679
I didn't much want to.

275
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,360
Your mum asked me.

276
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:15,040
She's been through the wringer
these last few years.

277
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:17,960
I know.

278
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:23,160

want to tell me that might help...

in the right place.

What do you mean?

281
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,320
He wasn't killed at the river.

282
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,920

goes into your pockets.

that the council puts money in,

Lynne.

626
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:14,559
No, I knew you were married
when we started. That's the point.

627
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,600
We both knew where we stood.

628
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:21,159
To be honest, it's a relief.

632
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,879

Laila, Jamila,

812
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:34,960
if we get deported back,
we are finished.

813
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:40,440
I will not risk it.

814
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:43,000
(SNIFFS)

815
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:52,159
(SIGHS) Kevin is Rachel's ex-husband.

816
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:53,639
He's Bill's son's best friend.

817
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:56,639
If you go accusing him,
it's lose-lose.

818
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:57,879
What, so that's it?

819
00:50:57,880 --> 00:50:58,880
He just...

820
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:02,120
..he just gets away with it?

821
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:04,679
(SIGHS)

822
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:07,799
Kevin
practically runs this town, Miki.

823
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:09,680
You're taking a lot on.

824
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:16,360
How old's Kevin?

825
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:19,560
Oh, mid-40s. Why?

826
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:26,280
I think I just realised who 'K' is.

827
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:30,400
(SIGHS)

828
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:10,519
It's a warm night.
You'll be alright out here tonight.

829
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:12,599
I'll find somewhere else
in the morning.

830
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:13,919
And tomorrow,

831
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:16,200
we'll get you a proper bed.

832
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:27,720
(DOOR CLOSES)

833
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:30,319
Is that...

834
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:32,920
..um...

835
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:36,999
Do you want to stay here or not?

836
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,360
I won't say anything.
LYNNE: Hm.

837
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:43,399
Now, use this mosquito net properly.

838
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:45,799
Make sure it's wrapped
all the way around, OK?

839
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:47,879
'Cause the mosquitoes
are bad tonight.

840
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:50,200
Miki?
Yep. Yep.

841
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:42,320
Mm-hm, mmm.

842
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:46,679
Mmm!

843
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:47,919
Sorry.

844
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:49,639
(LAUGHS)

845
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:51,319
Late breakfast.

846
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:53,039
(SIGHS)

847
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:54,760
SALIM: I, uh...

848
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:59,840
..I have something to tell you.

849
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:37,640
(BEEP)
(MACHINE CLICKS)

850
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:08,399
RACHEL: Have the results come in?

851
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:10,079
Mm-hm.

852
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:12,399
For you.

853
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:15,399
I ordered an almond milk,
like a wanker. (LAUGHS)

854
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:19,480
And can you confirm what time
his car left the meatworks?

855
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:22,559
Sure about that?

856
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:24,319
(SNIFFS)
OK.

857
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:26,079
Um...

858
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:30,119
..can you send those details over,
please, as soon as possible?

859
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:31,479
Thank you.

860
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:33,280
(HANGS UP)
What?

861
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:37,799
I sent Kevin's car to Forensics.

862
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:39,319
Thinks it's about the fireworks.

863
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:40,679
Well, why did you do that?

864
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:42,119
Um, Salim is in the interview room.

865
00:55:42,120 --> 00:55:44,279
If you can get his statement,
that'll, um...

866
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:45,359
..that'll explain everything.

867
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:47,520
Sure. Hey!

868
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:51,120
Kevin.

869
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:54,400
Kevin killed Hugh.

870
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:57,400
So...

871
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:01,400
(SIGHS)

872
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:07,920
(CHILD LAUGHS)

873
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:21,439
Wayan, let's come with me.

874
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:23,720
Let's go inside.

875
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:27,439
Is everything OK?

876
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:29,160
Have you arrested Nick yet?

877
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:33,919
I need you to come with me
and make a statement.

878
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:35,639
What for?

879
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:37,439
What, with the car?

880
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:38,839
No.

881
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:40,999
About the murder of Hugh Lang.

882
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,959
What's going on?
Ivy, let's go inside.

883
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:46,399
I'll arrest you, Kevin. I'll turn
that meatworks into a crime scene.

884
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:47,519
What the hell, Mum?

885
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:49,679
It's OK, Ivy.

886
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:53,199
You close down those meatworks
and there will be trouble.

887
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:54,840
You can't threaten me.

888
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:58,360
Get off my property.
No.

889
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:00,959
Get off my property!
IVY: Dad!

890
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:02,439
Ivy! Kevin, don't!
Get the fuck off!

891
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:04,479
Stop!
(GRUNTS)

892
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:05,480
Oh!

893
00:57:05,481 --> 00:57:08,359
Kevin Pattison, I'm arresting you on
suspicion of the murder of Hugh Lang.

(SIGHS)

895
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:45,679
BILL: You show this to a jury,

896
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:47,159
she's cactus, no matter what.

897
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:51,199
You lied to my face about where Miki
was the night Hugh Lang went missing.

898
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:52,839
JOEL: Miki, wait.

899
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:53,880
Just be careful.

900
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:57,999
Ah!

901
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,839
Are you willing to give a DNA sample

902
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:02,079
and fingerprints for comparison?

903
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:04,199
If I say no?

904
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:07,119
Innocent people usually say yes.

905
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:08,960
Are you and Miki in this together?

906
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:16,839
