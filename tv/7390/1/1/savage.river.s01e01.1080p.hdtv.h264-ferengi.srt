不像你和科琳，是吗
Not like you and Colleen, is it?

96
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,920
这样选边站
Taking sides like this?

97
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,080
黛博拉有一些好主意

98
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,840
格林尼胡说八道

99
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,880
她会关闭肉类加工厂

I think she wants to clean it up, Then where will this town be?

102
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:14,160
我想她想清理它，而不是关闭它

106
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,720
我准备好了
I'm ready.

107
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,240
我们现在该走了
We should go now.

108
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,800
我会带着我自己的海报回来

109
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,600
我会回来只是为了公平

111
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:36,640
典型的麦克斯不喜欢它 想要他自己的海报
Typical Max didn't like it. Wants his own poster up.

112
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,160
典型的麦克斯不喜欢它 公平地说，我没有意识到...
Typical Max didn't like it. To be fair, I didn't realise...

113
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,040
嘘
Boo!

114
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,080

我会得到它
I'll get it.

118
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,720
你好，亲爱的 你父亲在家吗

对不起，但我……不，我们……我们不会待太久，特里
I'm sorry, but I... No, we...we won't stay long, Terry.

124
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,840
请
Please.

125
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,560

哦，你看起来不错
Oh, you look well.

127
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,320
也许我们应该稍后再回来
Maybe we should come back later.

128
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,640
休，我们同意了
Hugh, we agreed.

129
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,200
我们认为您可能只需要一些东西 嗯...
We thought you just might need a few things. Um...

130
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,520
不知道这些天你会穿什么
Didn't know what you'd be wearing these days.

131
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,120
科琳，你不必这样做 不好了
Colleen, you don't have to do this. Oh, no.

132
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,400
科琳，你不必这样做 是的，我们有
Colleen, you don't have to do this. Yes, we do.

133
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,200
很抱歉我们没有早点来看你
I'm sorry we didn't come to see you sooner.

134
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,640
她不希望我们在这里
She doesn't want us here.

135
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,120
不，我...
No, I...

136
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:21,040
我想我只是……不习惯访客
I guess I'm just... not used to visitors.

137
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:25,160
你知道，不是没有一周的通知和完整的腔搜索
You know, not without a week's notice and a full cavity search.

138
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,440

140
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,120
为什么要这么做
Why would you do that?

141
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,040
看起来井井有条

161
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,560
我只想过我的生活
I just want to live my life.

162
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,520
像其他人一样 就这些
Like everyone else. That's all.

163
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:15,240
就我而言，干净的石板
Clean slate, as far as I'm concerned.

164
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:18,160
这是你必须担心的镇上的其他地方
It's the rest of the town you have to worry about.

165
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,800

I don't need to see your ID every time. I know it's you.

170
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,200
我不需要看你的ID 谢谢

229
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,040
这是贾斯的主意
It was Jas's idea.

230
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,120
她在电影里看过 它就像一个时间胶囊

234
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,360
然后你就有了房子和栅栏
And then you've got the house and the fence.

235
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,200
然后你得到了我刚刚的房子...
And then you've got the house I just...

236

我只是想你可能想要它

237
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,320
你从我身边夺走了我的女儿
You took my daughter from me.

238
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,000
你觉得这能弥补吗

239
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,520
我知道我不能改变...
I know I can't change...

240

你怎么敢
How dare you?!

244
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,760
当她不能的时候，你怎么敢在你的肺里呼吸
How dare you take breath in your lungs when she can't?!

245
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,760
继续前进
And keep going!

246
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,600

387
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:48,080
并且不会给我们第二个孩子

388
00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:50,290
现在我姐姐也走了

389

..但现在对我来说并不是招聘的好时机，你知道吗
..but it's not really a good time for me to be hiring, you know?

490
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:54,040
我有一个强壮的胃 嗯
I've got a strong stomach. Mm.

491
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:56,000
正确的 我会做别人不想做的工作

00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,200
好的 这是我假释的一部分
OK. That's part of my parole.

496

哦 那是莱拉的东西
Oh. That's Laila's stuff.

516
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:11,280
把它装进袋子里，然后带到难民区
Chuck it in a bag and take it up to the refugee quarters.

517
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:17,120

她怎么了 莱拉

00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,320
这是莱拉的工作
This is Laila's job.

526
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:56,040
伙计，我不能为不在的人保留住工作
Mate, I can't very well keep a job for someone who's not here.

527
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,360
伙计，我不能为不在的人保留住工作 我不能
Mate, I can't very well keep a job OK? I can't.

528
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:59,080
她的签证不是我的问题

533
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,280
嗯
Mm.

534
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,560
你确定吗 是的
Are you sure? Yep.

535
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:18,240
呃……这曾经是机器损坏之前的牛肉车间
Uh... This used to be the beef floor before the machinery carked it.

536
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:30,240
您大部分时间都会待在这里
You'll be spending most of your time up here.

537
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,480
注意气味
Watch out for the smell.

538
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,160
它真的打动了你
It really hits you.

539
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,920
你说得对吗？
You right?

540
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,240
只是要让你知道，
Just so you know,

541
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:49,280
那是上面的杀戮箱
that's the kill box up there.

542
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,760
你不该在上面，好吗
You've got no business being up there, OK?

543
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:55,640
我要你在每次轮班结束时清洗地板
And I want you to wash down the floors at the end of every shift.

544
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:58,160
戴尔，你能给她看看绳子吗 是的，不用担心
Dale, can you show her the ropes? Yeah, no worries.

545
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,920
- 谢了哥们  - 喂，杀手
- Thanks, mate.  - Oi, killer!

546

Thanks, mate. Who are you gonna kill next, huh?

547
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:06,200
当心，否则她会毁了你们所有人
Watch out or she'll gut all of you!

548
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:09,200
别担心，他们最终会感到无聊
Don't worry, they'll get bored eventually.

549
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,720
你把你的肝脏和心脏扔到那个上面
You throw your liver and hearts down that one.

550
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:13,520
肺直接穿过
The lungs go straight through.

551
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:16,960
肠子，肠子往下走
Guts, intestines go down that one.

552
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:19,360
不是火箭手术
Not rocket surgery.

553
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:25,520
喂 罗密欧
Oi! Romeo!

554
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,520
拿起你的心，滚蛋
Pick up your heart and fuck off!

555
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:36,400
你必须像他们中的一员一样 好吧
You've just got to be like one of them. Alright?

556
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,240

那么生活会很糟糕，是的 但是如果我不想呢
Then life's gonna suck pretty hard, Yep. But what if I don't want to?

558
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:41,640
那么生活会很糟糕，亲爱的
Then life's gonna suck pretty hard, honey.

559
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:50,920
呃……如果是猪肉的话，我不能吃
Uh... If they are pork, I can't eat them.

560
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:53,160
