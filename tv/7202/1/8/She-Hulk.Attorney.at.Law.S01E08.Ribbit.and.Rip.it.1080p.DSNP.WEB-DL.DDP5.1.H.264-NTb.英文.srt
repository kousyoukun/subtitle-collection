1
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:03,410
I'm not gonna be a superhero.

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:05,330
What else ya gonna do as a Hulk?

3
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:17,160
Previously, on my show...

4
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,580
Remember my date with the guy with the fetish?

5
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:20,870
Did you call me a specimen?

6
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:22,040
As a compliment.

7
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:24,500
I wanna see the supersuit that Luke made you.

8
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,080
Why? I won't wear it.

9
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,080
You didn't tell me you were nominated for Female Lawyer of the Year.

10
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,660
Do we get to go to a gala?

11
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:34,870
My friend sent me a link to a video post on that site, Intelligencia.

12
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:37,290
- I met a guy. - I'm Josh.

13
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:39,450
We went on a few dates, it was going great.

14
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:40,750
And I haven't heard from him.

15
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:42,000
You were ghosted.

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,410
Next time you think of Josh,

17
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,040
everyone we meet, no matter how much they hurt you,

18
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:49,290
is a lesson learned.

19
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:29,750
Is this OLED or QLED?

20
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:31,040
My online research tells me

21
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,750
OLED is better for color resolution and picture quality.

22
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:36,040
Funny enough, I actually read the article...

23
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:40,580
The store might be closed, but you forgot about

24
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:43,040
the Guard Frog.

25
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:49,950
The hell is a Guard Frog?

26
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:51,290
I think it's his name.

27
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:53,660
My name is Leapfrog.

28
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:57,500
I'm just acting like I'm the Guard Frog in this particular instance.

29
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,000
"The Guard Frog"?

30
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,160
Yeah, but my name is Leapfrog.

31
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:04,040
Yes, that has been noted several times, Mr. Patilio.

32
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,830
- Cool. - So, your defective suit...

33
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:08,370
Right. So, I was surrounded by these huge guys.

34
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:10,200
Twisting toe jam!

35
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:13,370
Although I was outnumbered, I could tell they were afraid of me.

36
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:18,000
So, in order to de-escalate the situation, I shouted my signature catchphrase.

37
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,950
Time to ribbit and rip it!

38
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,450
And then next thing I know,

39
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:34,910
my inflammable suit with a 900-degree threshold is on fire.

40
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:39,200
And, you guessed it, I have third-degree burns all over my legs.

41
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:43,500
I mean, I deserve justice.

42
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:49,330
And compensation for all of my pain, mental anguish and...

43
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,040
Stuff.

44
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,750
Well, this does seem to be a pretty clear case of manufacturer's defect,

45
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:57,910
negligence, strict liability, and breach of warranty.

46
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,750
- Yes? - I do believe

47
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,830
you are owed compensatory damages.

48
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:03,120
Yeah! Whoo!

49
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:05,910
What is the name of the manufacturer?

50
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:09,330
Luke Jacobson. He specializes in supersuits.

51
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:10,410
Oh, shit.

52
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:15,410
Jacobson is the only tailor I can go to because of my unique physique.

53
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,750
Do you think maybe Pug could take this one?

54
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:21,750
Mr. Patilio is one of our biggest clients.

55
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:23,330
The guy dressed as a frog?

56
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:24,950
Mr. Patilio, Sr.

57
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:28,910
Look, it's very important that we keep the Patilios happy.

58
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,040
Eugene is also very excited to have a Hulk on the case.

59
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,160
And they're willing to sign a conflict waiver

60
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:36,500
to have you, Ms. Walters.

61
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:39,120
But I believe I would be ethically compromised

62
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,450
in representing a client against Jacobson.

63
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:44,040
I like my nice clothes and I don't wanna piss him off.

64
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:47,120
You've handled a client who had to sign a conflict waiver before,

65
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,080
in a case one would argue is a lot more personal than this one.

66
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:53,950
Yes, and I would love not to be in that position again.

67
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:55,950
Also, he's making me a dress for the gala.

68
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:57,370
Very well, Ms. Walters.

69
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:02,370
I suggest that you try to come to an agreement with Mr. Jacobson

70
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:06,290
so then a filing would not be necessary. Understood?

71
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:10,370
- Ribbit and rip it. - Yes, ribbit and rip it indeed.

72
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:18,830
Jennifer, do not rush me.

73
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:21,660
I told you your dress will not be ready until Friday.

74
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:24,750
You wanna look good for your lawyer award, right?

75
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:28,540
Uh, yes. Well, Luke, I am here under some

76
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:30,450
unpleasant business.

77
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:36,250
I have been retained by a client who suffered serious injuries

78
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,910
due to a dysfunctional suit that you sold him.

79
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,830
Nothing has been filed. I think we can come to some kind of...

80
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:42,950
Excuse me?

81
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:45,290
How dare you.

82
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:49,450
I have never made a defective suit in all my life. My work is impeccable.

83
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:52,450
Obviously, I know that firsthand. And I...

84
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:54,540
Trust me, I'm not happy to be doing this.

85
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:55,660
I'm not trusting you

86
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:58,700
after you just lumbered in here and stabbed me in the back.

87
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,700
Well, there's no lawsuit yet.

88
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,040
And there won't be

89
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:06,080
if you just take some responsibility for some of my client's injuries.

90
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,580
I do not make suits that malfunction.

91
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,290
My work speaks for itself.

92
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:12,950
Oh, excuse me. What did you say?

93
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:15,580
She wants to tell me something, hold on.

94
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:21,410
"She-Hulk will never get another suit by Luke Jacobson ever again?"

95
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,410
Hey, I pre-paid for that!

96
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,330
Then you shouldn't have betrayed me.

97
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:30,870
You are blocked, blacklisted and reported!

98
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:32,330
Now, I am gonna take you down.

99
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:36,250
Well, I hope it's not down to wherever it is you get your ugly clothes from.

100
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:38,450
See you in court!

101
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,000
Can you...

102
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:41,450
Goodbye, tragedy.

103
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:56,080
Mr. Jacobson, I see you are presently without counsel.

104
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,450
Are you representing yourself?

105
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,370
Representing himself?

106
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:03,000
Start planning how you're gonna spend all your new money.

107
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,410
Mr. Jacobson?

108
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:09,580
Of course I'm not representing myself, Your Honor. I'm not a fool.

109
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:11,500
Then where is your counsel?

110
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:19,450
I'm here.

111
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:24,450
Apologies for the tardiness, Your Honor. I had trouble finding parking.

112
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:28,000
I'm just kidding. My driver got lost.

113
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,750
My name is Matthew Murdock.

114
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:32,250
I'll be representing Mr. Jacobson in this case.

115
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:33,660
Hey. Sorry I'm late.

116
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,660
As a first point of order, I'd like to ask that

117
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:39,450
the motion to compel production of the defendant's client list be rejected

118
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:41,500
as it's not relevant to the litigation.

119
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,950
Who's this asshole?

120
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:46,540
Your Honor, I believe this information to be incredibly relevant

121
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:48,330
given the nature of the complaint.

122
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:52,000
There could be multiple instances of Mr. Jacobson's other clients

123
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,250
sustaining injuries from faulty merchandise.

124
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:56,830
I believe Ms. Walters will find that Mr. Jacobson's record

125
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:59,450
as it pertains to customer satisfaction to be spotless.

126
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:03,370
If the defendant has nothing to hide, then why not hear from his clients?

127
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:06,500
That's an invasion of privacy based on a very shaky "what if."

128
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:09,830
This is a very common procedure in product liability lawsuits.

129
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:11,410
It is material to the case whether

130
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:14,040
this type of malfunction has affected other people.

131
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,080
There is no inherent right to privacy

132
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,620
when employing Mr. Jacobson's tailoring services.

133
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:20,620
We're not just talking about a product here.

134
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:22,620
The very nature of Mr. Jacobson's line of work,

135
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:26,290
making suits exclusively for superheroes, necessitates anonymity.

136
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:29,040
May I remind you that the Sokovia Accords have been repealed.

137
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,410
Superheroes operate in the public eye.

138
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:38,000
As public figures, it is assumed that there will be some loss of privacy.

139
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,250
We're not talking about celebrities,

140
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:43,160
but superheroes who have enemies who will try to harm them,

141
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:44,410
and people close to them.

142
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,700
The ones who didn't ask to be a part of this life.

143
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:49,200
Ms. Walters chose to have her identity be public,

144
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,160
but she can't choose for everyone else.

145
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:53,250
This isn't about privacy for privacy's sake.

146
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:57,040
If this information is not protected, not only would it ruin my client's career,

147
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,290
it could put a lot of people in a lot of danger,

148
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:01,450
and all over one man's misuse of a suit.

149
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:03,500
I'm in agreement with Mr. Murdock.

150
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:07,160
Motion to compel discovery is denied.

151
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:09,700
Wait. Does that mean I don't get a new suit?

152
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:10,620
Sit down!

153
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,620
What, no... Look at this thing!

154
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:14,620
How am I supposed to wear this?

155
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:19,500
Mr. Patilio, what kind of fuel did you use in your boosters?

156
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,580
Jet fuel.

157
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:24,080
Wait a minute, you used jet fuel in your boosters?

158
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,370
Because that's not what my instructions said.

159
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:27,330
What?

160
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:30,500
No, I didn't.

161
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:33,660
He's lying. Don't ask me how I know, I just know.

162
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:36,080
Yes, we can all tell he's lying, Mr. Murdock.

163
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,620
If the plaintiff ignored the manufacturer's explicit instructions,

164
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:44,000
then the defendant is absolved of all liability.

165
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,580
I'm dismissing this case.

166
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:47,200
Am I gonna go to jail?

167
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,200
No, but I would like you to.

168
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,410
- And Luke, Luke. - Yes, clown?

169
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,540
I just wanted to apologize for...

170
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:55,500
For daring to question my craftsmanship?

171
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:59,040
Is there any way that we could go back to you being my tailor?

172
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,290
Jennifer, Jenny, Jen.

173
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,580
No. Because I hate you now.

174
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:16,540
What's this?

175
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:18,160
It's from that guy over there.

176
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,000
An appletini? Cute.

177
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,120
Mind if I join you?

178
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:25,950
Sure.

179
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,330
Would you mind?

180
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:35,330
I wanted to extend a peace offering.

181
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,790
Ugh! I hate it when people take the high road.

182
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:41,370
So, what's your story, Matt Murdock?

183
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:42,500
You're from New York

184
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,700
but you flew all the way out here for a product liability case?

185
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:49,200
Luke Jacobson made a couple of new suits for me, so I owed him one.

186
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,750
Doesn't really look like it.

187
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:54,040
That's a low blow insulting a blind man's clothes.

188
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,540
I'm wearing pants, right?

189
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,370
You have your own practice, right?

190
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:03,410
Ms. Walters, have you been checking up on me?

191
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,580
Yeah. Can you blame me? You came out of nowhere

192
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,160
and you made my dumb client admit

193
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:09,620
to being even dumber than I thought he was in court.

194
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:11,290
How did you know about the jet fuel?

195
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:13,000
A hunch.

196
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,830
What is his deal, by the way?

197
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:16,830
- Well, I'll give you one guess. - Okay.

198
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:18,540
It rhymes with "rich parents."

199
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:20,540
Wait, I said it was rich parents.

200
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:24,910
His dad is a very important client, so he is a very important client.

201
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,370
Well, you know the expression, "One for them, one for us"?

202
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:28,290
Yeah.

203
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:30,910
Well, I run my practice in Hell's Kitchen,

204
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,200
and we mostly do pro bono work. The "us" part.

205
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:37,450
But I do on occasion take a job with a bigger client

206
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:41,000
when the bills start piling up. The "them" part.

207
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,080
Wow. Secret double lives of Matt Murdock, how does he do it?

208
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:48,370
As someone who works for "them" full-time,

209
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:51,250
I really don't have any gas in the tank for anything else.

210
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,910
Yeah, you say that,

211
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,540
but I think you're in a unique position to do some real good.

212
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:00,250
You see, the way I see it,

213
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,580
Jen Walters can use the law to help people when society fails them.

214
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:08,540
And She-Hulk can help people when the law fails them.

215
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,830
So, you can, if you choose...

216
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:14,910
Be the best of both worlds.

217
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:19,910
- Excuse me for a moment. - Yeah.

218
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:28,040
We're all feeling this, right, it's not just me?

219
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:36,870
Ugh! You remember Todd, that gross tech bro with the She-Hulk fetish?

220
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:40,580
Hey, do you wanna get another round?

221
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:44,040
Jen, I am so sorry, I have to go. Something has just come up with work.

222
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:47,500
Oh, yeah. Totally. I got work, too.

223
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,950
- Yeah. - Um...

224
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:51,000
Uh, yeah, it was really...

225
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,410
It was nice meeting you.

226
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,870
Yeah, you, too.

227
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:09,830
Okay.

228
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:13,000
Mr. Phelps.

229
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:15,450
Mr... It's Todd.

230
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:20,540
So, what is the urgent matter that you wanted to discuss with me?

231
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:24,120
Oh, yeah... So, I was at an auction recently buying art

232
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:29,200
and then, get this, they had an authentic Wakandan war spear.

233
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:34,080
So, I, of course, win the auction. A millie.

234
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,700
It's a million.

235
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:42,750
- Dollars. - I got that.

236
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:45,330
Yeah. So... I mean, you gotta see it, right?

237
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:48,040
So, here it is. Check this out.

238
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,120
Boom. How cool is that?

239
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,790
I mean, I own that now.

240
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:55,910
God, no one is collecting African shit on my level.

241
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,700
I love it. I love Wakanda. You know, I actually studied abroad there.

242
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:01,620
Really?

243
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:03,620
Wakanda Forever!

244
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:06,160
Ooh! I... That makes me uncomfortable.

245
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:09,290
So, is there a legal issue with your purchase?

246
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:12,830
No, no. Well, okay, they want it back

247
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:16,000
because apparently it was stolen by colonizers,

248
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,620
but whatever. I mean, I got the receipts.

249
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:26,620
You know, listen, babe.

250
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:30,040
Let's just drop the whole coy thing 'cause I don't play games, okay?

251
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,750
And I can feel it and I can tell that we're both feeling it.

252
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,500
Ugh! No!

253
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:39,950
Goodbye. Oh, and I'm billing you for the whole hour.

254
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:44,160
What?

255
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:02,870
Oh, God.

256
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,450
- Hello? - Thank God! Ms. Walters, it's Leapfrog.

257
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:08,910
Listen, you gotta help me. I think I'm being attacked.

258
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,370
Legally or physically?

259
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:13,830
Definitely physically. But, I mean, maybe legally, too.

260
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:15,040
Where are you?

261
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,830
I'm on my way to the Lily Pad.

262
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,040
Is that a place I'm supposed to know?

263
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,790
Yeah. It's my famous secret lair.

264
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,750
Yeah, I just need to find my friends.

265
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:26,580
Okay, I'm gonna try to lose him in this parking lot.

266
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:28,250
- I'm gonna lose ya. - You're close.

267
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:30,410
I'm heading to you. We'll meet in the middle.

268
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,330
Hurry!

269
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,080
My car!

270
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:58,450
You need to back off.

271
00:14:58,450 --> 00:14:59,750
And waste this outfit?

272
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:01,250
Eugene, get out of here.

273
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:02,330
Dope supersuit!

274
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:03,580
You're making a mistake.

275
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:06,580
You made a mistake when you messed with my client!

276
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:08,660
'Cause now I'm gonna whoop your ass.

277
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,450
Huh. My ass remains unwhooped.

278
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,450
Yeah? Let's fix that.

279
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:29,080
Ribbit and rip it!

280
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:32,500
Where are you going? We're not done.

281
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,080
You're very persistent, aren't you?

282
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:36,250
And you're very annoying.

283
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,000
See you later!

284
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:50,700
Come on!

285
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:56,120
Gotcha.

286
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:00,250
Whoa, whoa! Jen!

287
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:03,080
Matt?

288
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:10,910
Wait. Do you pretend to be blind, man? 'Cause that is really problematic.

289
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,660
No. No, no, I'm blind, I'm blind. Relax. I...

290
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:16,370
I have a spatial method that I use to see.

291
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,540
Oh, like echolocation?

292
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:23,250
Yeah, kind of. It's... Basically I have really good hearing.

293
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:24,620
Or at least I did.

294
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:26,370
Wait, why were you attacking my client?

295
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:27,790
Leapfrog is the bad guy here.

296
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:30,120
He kidnapped Luke Jacobson. He's holding him hostage.

297
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,160
Why didn't you tell me that before we fought?

298
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:35,700
Why didn't you ask me before trying to whoop my ass?

299
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:39,080
I'm sorry that I assumed the guy dressed as the devil was the bad one.

300
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,200
Yeah, that's a fair point.

301
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,580
So, are you, like, a superhero?

302
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:48,080
Like the Gold Devil?

303
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:50,790
I'm Daredevil.

304
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:57,370
It is very daring to use ketchup and mustard as your color scheme.

305
00:16:57,370 --> 00:16:58,540
How 'bout I tell Luke?

306
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:00,000
No! No, please don't.

307
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,080
Okay. Well, if you're done making fun, I need to save my client from your client.

308
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,580
Okay, yeah, let's go.

309
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,790
You ever destroy a parking lot before?

310
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:10,040
Crap. I'll go leave a note.

311
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:15,410
Hmm. Subtle.

312
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:19,080
For version two, we gotta go all out.

313
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:22,000
I'm talking bulletproof shields,

314
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,080
fancy AI with a British voice that talks to you.

315
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:29,120
Oh, snap! And some of those poison darts, like the tree frogs.

316
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:32,500
I don't know who told you that you could pull off this color,

317
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,620
but you should go back to them and shoot them.

318
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:40,790
Look, I know you're just being mean because I kidnapped you,

319
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:43,330
but words hurt, man.

320
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:47,790
Guys, what do we think about the name "Leap Squad"?

321
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:49,450
You know, like, "Leap Squad!"

322
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:52,250
I can't believe this dodo has henchmen.

323
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:55,120
Actually, I can. I bet these goons work for his dad.

324
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,160
Nah, see, that's where you're wrong.

325
00:17:57,250 --> 00:18:00,000
Goons and henchmen are two completely different animals.

326
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,200
Henchmen believe in the cause, goons are just there for the paycheck.

327
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,790
Henchmen, goons, whatever.

328
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,870
There are 25 goons in the building.

329
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:11,790
Seven below us, eight in the front, and 10 in the hallway.

330
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:13,200
How do you know that?

331
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,700
I can hear their heartbeats.

332
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:19,450
You can hear their heartbeats? Come on, that's a little far-fetched.

333
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:27,450
I can hear yours, too. Your heart's beating pretty fast.

334
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:31,540
What?

335
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:33,250
What? No, it's not. I'm healthy.

336
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:36,120
Okay.

337
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:39,450
I'll sneak in and take out the goons in the back.

338
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:41,250
It'll take me 15 seconds for each one.

339
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:43,160
So, wait here until I've gotten all 10.

340
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:46,620
I'm not gonna sit here for half an hour while you pick off goons one by one.

341
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:48,200
That's not how that math works out.

342
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,330
I'm a Hulk. How about I just smash our way in?

343
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:51,830
They have weapons, Jennifer.

344
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:54,540
Yeah, good thing She-Hulk is indestructible, Matthew.

345
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:57,040
Stealth's the way to go. I've done this a million times.

346
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,250
Have you broken into a warehouse full of goons?

347
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:01,450
Remind me again who has the superpowers here?

348
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:03,080
I'm pointing at myself.

349
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:05,790
Oh, yeah, I know. I have echolocation, remember?

350
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:07,000
Just let me do my thing.

351
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,410
Yeah, and I will do my thing.

352
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:13,750
You... You don't have a thing. You don't ever do this.

353
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:17,080
Just follow my lead.

354
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,620
Okay, I guess that's pretty cool.

355
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:27,040
So, I said I respect that you wanna dress up like a frog,

356
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,500
but that doesn't mean I'm cool with being a baby frog.

357
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,910
Wait, I thought he wanted to call us "Tadpoles."

358
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:32,830
Yeah, man.

359
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:34,410
How do you not know what...

360
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:08,000
GOON 2 ON WALKIE: Tadpole five, come in.

361
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,450
We need backup at the rear entrance. We got...

362
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:11,870
Tadpole five, repeat.

363
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:16,500
Hang tight, backup's on the way.

364
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:40,830
She-Hulk smash.

365
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Ugh! More hench-goons?

366
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:58,370
How about we don't?

367
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:00,500
Whoa! Hey! That's vintage!

368
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:06,660
Hey, what are you doing? You're supposed to be helping me.

369
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:10,660
I am helping you. I'm stopping you from getting into even more trouble.

370
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,290
Go call the police.

371
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:17,250
Don't you yell at me. I'm already very stressed out.

372
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:19,910
Eugene, let me give you some legal advice.

373
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,950
Stop now, before you rack up even more serious charges.

374
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:25,700
Legally speaking, we could say this is an episode of mania...

375
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:28,500
Temporary insanity is murky, but it's not a bad strategy.

376
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:33,370
I'd angle this more as a form of traumatic expression due to undiagnosed PTSD.

377
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:36,120
So, the devil ninja guy, he's a lawyer?

378
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,950
No. I'm just a big fan of legal dramas.

379
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:40,660
This guy's really kinda doing it for me.

380
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:45,660
It's sad that you thought that would work.

381
00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:49,870
No shame in retreat.

382
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:51,950
Ribbit and rip it! Oh!

383
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:06,200
Well, well, well, I suppose we're even now. You're forgiven.

384
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,830
So, you'll make my gala dress?

385
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,580
Yes, of course. I'm not a monster.

386
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:15,410
Try not to get too bloated between now and then.

387
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:22,450
Great to be strained professional acquaintances again.

388
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:38,500
Are you gonna give a statement to the cops?

389
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:41,370
I'm not really a stick around and talk to the cops kinda guy.

390
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,160
Oh, so brooding.

391
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:48,120
More of a secret identity thing. - You wouldn't understand.

392
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:53,870
Thanks for your help with all of this.

393
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,750
Thanks for your help.

394
00:22:57,450 --> 00:22:59,160
No. You're the one who helped me.

395
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:02,080
No. I was the lead superhero on this.

396
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:05,160
Uh, you were they guy who wanted to spend half an hour

397
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:07,580
picking off each goon, one by one.

398
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:10,540
You were the woman who caused excessive property damage.

399
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:12,660
And you still can't get that math right.

400
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:16,950
When do you head to New York?

401
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:20,620
- Tomorrow. - Oh... Well...

402
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:30,160
Hey, maybe next time I'm in town, I can take you out to dinner.

403
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:33,620
Yeah, or maybe we can skip all of that and just...

404
00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:51,660
That's all right. That's okay.

405
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:53,750
Wait, you have to... All right, here you go.

406
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:55,160
Okay. Let's go.

407
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:18,870
Good morning.

408
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:30,620
It's weird you guys are still here.

409
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,700
Doesn't it feel like this episode should be over?

410
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:36,790
Hello! Uh...

411
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:41,580
Why didn't you answer my calls? I thought that you were dead.

412
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,660
I had to break and enter. By the way,

413
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:46,040
there's some guy outside dressed in a devil costume

414
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:48,330
and he's doing the walk of shame 'cause he's...

415
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,790
Oh. You did... With the...

416
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:52,870
Yes.

417
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:54,330
Oh, all right. And we're happy?

418
00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:55,660
- Oh, we're happy. - Okay.

419
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:57,160
All right. You're the devil.

420
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:01,040
Seriously, what is this scene?

421
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:05,330
This episode already came to a very satisfying conclusion. Trust me.

422
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:07,290
Come on! We gotta go. Tell me about it later.

423
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:10,000
We have to do your hair and your makeup. Where is the gown from Luke?

424
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:11,950
Oh, for the gala?

425
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:15,040
Wait, we're doing the gala? That doesn't feel right.

426
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,870
Is next episode the finale?

427
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:18,450
Come on. Let's go.

428
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:23,120
Just like a tacked-on set piece near the end of the season.

429
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,790
This is the big twist, isn't it? But the question is,

430
00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:27,450
is it the kind of twist that's like,

431
00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:29,330
"There's another Hulk, but this one's red,"

432
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:31,120
or like, "I'm getting fridged?"

433
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:34,500
We gotta make you look amazing.

434
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:36,500
Whatever. I'm game.

435
00:26:07,290 --> 00:26:12,160
Sweetheart. You didn't bring a jacket? What if you get cold?

436
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:15,160
She can wear mine, Elaine. We are so proud of you.

437
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:17,790
- Thank you, Dad. - Your jacket won't fit her, Morris.

438
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:20,910
You can't cover up a Luke Jacobson-Zuhair Murad collaboration.

439
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,120
Nikki! That's certainly a mouthful.

440
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,830
I'm a little nervous.

441
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,450
Okay. Let's find our table.

442
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:29,700
- Yeah. There he is. Hi! - Let's go. Come on.

443
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:30,790
Come on.

444
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:32,950
Educated.

445
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:34,620
Accomplished.

446
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:35,870
Beautiful.

447
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:40,120
And doing everything regular lawyers do, except backwards,

448
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:41,830
and in high heels.

449
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:48,040
This year's Female Lawyer of the Year award goes to...

450
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:50,450
Jennifer "She-Hulk" Walters!

451
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:51,870
Let's go!

452
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:55,620
Kara Hunter.

453
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:57,120
Alice Chen.

454
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,660
Joanne Torres.

455
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:00,250
Barbara Wells.

456
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:01,660
Mallory Book.

457
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:07,250
Now tell us, what's it like being a female lawyer?

458
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:11,370
So special and empowering. I love it.

459
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:14,660
Twice the work, half the recognition,

460
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:18,290
and you're constantly being asked what it's like being a female lawyer.

461
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:19,250
Yeah.

462
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:25,790
I'd actually like to take this time to thank my parents.

463
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:28,750
And my friends, and my esteemed colleagues

464
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:30,660
without whom I wouldn't be here today.

465
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:33,830
Do you want to see who She-Hulk really is?

466
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:37,500
Uh, my identity is not a secret.

467
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:39,580
This is busted.

468
00:27:40,330 --> 00:27:43,290
This is the truth presented by Intelligencia.

469
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:47,950
She-Hulk does not deserve your attention. She does not deserve your praise.

470
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:51,160
She does not deserve the power she stole from the Hulk.

471
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:53,410
What the hell this? Can somebody cut this off?

472
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:54,830
Can we turn this off, please?

473
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:56,750
Okay, let's... Can we stop this?

474
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:58,620
- And she's a slut. - Can you stop it?

475
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:00,750
Yeah, maybe you should lie down.

476
00:28:03,290 --> 00:28:05,580
Excuse me! Can you turn this off?

477
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:17,250
Don't do it, Jen.

478
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:19,660
Don't do it.

479
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:03,450
Don't move!

480
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:04,370
Jen! No!
