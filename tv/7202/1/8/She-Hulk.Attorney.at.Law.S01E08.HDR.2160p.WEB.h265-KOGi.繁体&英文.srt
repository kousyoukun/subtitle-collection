1
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:03,410
我不想成為超級英雄
I'm not gonna be a superhero.

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:05,330
那你一個浩克還想干什么
What else ya gonna do as a Hulk?

3
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:17,160
我這部劇的前情提要...
Previously, on my show...

4
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,580
還記得我約會的那個崇拜狂嗎
Remember my date with the guy with the fetish?

5
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:20,870
你是叫我樣本嗎
Did you call me a specimen?

6
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:22,040
我是在夸你呢
As a compliment.

7
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:24,500
你應該穿盧克給你定制的 那件超級套裝
I wanna see the supersuit that Luke made you.

8
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,080
為什么 我才不穿
Why? I won't wear it.

9
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,080
你都沒告訴我 你被提名“年度女律師”了
You didn't tell me you were nominated for Female Lawyer of the Year.

10
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,660
咱們是不是能參加晚宴了
Do we get to go to a gala?

11
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:34,870
我朋友給我發了個鏈接 是一段發在“情報聯盟”上的視頻
My friend sent me a link to a video post on that site, Intelligencia.

12
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:35,790
干掉女浩克

13
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:37,290
-我遇到了一位男士 -我叫喬希
- I met a guy. - I'm Josh.

14
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:39,450
我們約會過幾次 進展挺順利的
We went on a few dates, it was going great.

15
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:40,750
然后我就聯系不上他了
And I haven't heard from him.

16
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:42,000
我覺得他就是不辭而別了
You were ghosted.

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,410
當你再想起喬希的時候
Next time you think of Josh,

18
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,040
記住我們遇到的每個人 無論他傷害你有多深
everyone we meet, no matter how much they hurt you,

19
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:49,290
都會讓你成長
is a lesson learned.

20
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:29,750
這臺的屏幕是OLED還是QLED
Is this OLED or QLED?

21
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:31,040
我在網上查到
My online research tells me

22
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,750
OLED的色彩分辨率和畫面質量更好
OLED is better for color resolution and picture quality.

23
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:36,040
有趣的是 我還真記住了...
Funny enough, I actually read the article...

24
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:40,580
雖然商店關門了 但是別忘了
The store might be closed, but you forgot about

25
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:43,040
看門蛙還在呢
the Guard Frog.

26
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:49,950
看門蛙是什么玩意
The hell is a Guard Frog?

27
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:51,290
這就是他的名字吧
I think it's his name.

28
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:53,660
我的名字叫跳蛙
My name is Leapfrog.

29
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:57,500
我剛才只是在特定的情況下 扮演看門蛙的角色
I'm just acting like I'm the Guard Frog in this particular instance.

30
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,000
“看門蛙”
"The Guard Frog"?

31
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,160
對 但是我的名字叫跳蛙
Yeah, but my name is Leapfrog.

32
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:04,040
明白 這點你已經反復聲明過了 帕蒂利奧先生
Yes, that has been noted several times, Mr. Patilio.

33
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,830
-好吧 -那么 你的戰服有質量問題...
- Cool. - So, your defective suit...

34
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:08,370
沒錯 當時這些壯漢正在圍攻我
Right. So, I was surrounded by these huge guys.

35
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:10,200
霹靂回旋跺
Twisting toe jam!

36
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:13,370
雖然敵眾我寡 但是我看得出來 他們忌憚我
Although I was outnumbered, I could tell they were afraid of me.

37
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:18,000
所以為了緩和局勢 我喊出了標志性的口號
So, in order to de-escalate the situation, I shouted my signature catchphrase.

38
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,950
怒蛙咆哮 全部干掉
Time to ribbit and rip it!

39
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,450
接下來發生的就是
And then next thing I know,

40
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:34,910
我那件耐九百度高溫的防火戰服 居然著火了
my inflammable suit with a 900-degree threshold is on fire.

41
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:39,200
結果可想而知 我的雙腿三級燒傷
And, you guessed it, I have third-degree burns all over my legs.

42
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:43,500
我需要正義的裁決
I mean, I deserve justice.

43
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:49,330
還得賠償我承受的痛苦 無論是肉體上...
And compensation for all of my pain, mental anguish and...

44
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,040
還是精神上
Stuff.

45
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,750
你這個情況確實是 非常典型的產品缺陷案件
Well, this does seem to be a pretty clear case of manufacturer's defect,

46
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:57,910
涉及產品事故 嚴格產品責任 以及違反質保
negligence, strict liability, and breach of warranty.

47
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,750
-對吧  -我認為
- Yes? - I do believe

48
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,830
你應該能獲得補償性損害賠償
you are owed compensatory damages.

49
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:03,120
太棒了
Yeah! Whoo!

50
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:05,910
制造商的名字是什么
What is the name of the manufacturer?

51
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:09,330
盧克·雅各布森 他專門做超能戰服
Luke Jacobson. He specializes in supersuits.

52
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:10,410
不是吧
Oh, shit.

53
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:15,410
雅各布森是唯一能給我這體格 做衣服的裁縫
Jacobson is the only tailor I can go to because of my unique physique.

54
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,750
您覺得讓巴戈接這個案子可以嗎
Do you think maybe Pug could take this one?

55
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:21,750
帕蒂利奧先生可是我們的大客戶
Mr. Patilio is one of our biggest clients.

56
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:23,330
就那個打扮成青蛙的家伙
The guy dressed as a frog?

57
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:24,950
我是說老帕蒂利奧
Mr. Patilio, Sr.

58
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:28,910
總之 絕對不能得罪 帕蒂利奧家的人
Look, it's very important that we keep the Patilios happy.

59
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,040
尤金本人對浩克來負責這個案件 也很興奮
Eugene is also very excited to have a Hulk on the case.

60
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,160
而且為了讓你接手 沃爾特斯小姐
And they're willing to sign a conflict waiver

61
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:36,500
他們愿意簽署利益沖突豁免函
to have you, Ms. Walters.

62
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:39,120
但是要我幫客戶去告雅各布森
But I believe I would be ethically compromised

63
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,450
我自己的立場會很不堅定的
in representing a client against Jacobson.

64
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:44,040
我喜歡那些漂亮衣服 我可不想得罪他
I like my nice clothes and I don't wanna piss him off.

65
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:47,120
你又不是第一次 處理涉及利益沖突的案子了
You've handled a client who had to sign a conflict waiver before,

66
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,080
更何況上次那個案子的沖突 可比這個大多了
in a case one would argue is a lot more personal than this one.

67
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:53,950
沒錯 但是我可不想 再處于那種境地了
Yes, and I would love not to be in that position again.

68
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:55,950
而且他現在正給我做晚宴禮服呢
Also, he's making me a dress for the gala.

69
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:57,370
好吧 沃爾特斯小姐
Very well, Ms. Walters.

70
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:02,370
我建議你嘗試和雅各布森先生 達成和解
I suggest that you try to come to an agreement with Mr. Jacobson

71
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:06,290
這樣就不用對簿公堂了 明白了嗎
so then a filing would not be necessary. Understood?

72
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:10,370
-怒蛙咆哮 全部干掉 -對 怒蛙咆哮 全部干掉
- Ribbit and rip it. - Yes, ribbit and rip it indeed.

73
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:18,830
珍妮佛 不要催我
Jennifer, do not rush me.

74
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:21,660
我和你說了 周五之前做不好
I told you your dress will not be ready until Friday.

75
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:24,750
你想在領獎臺上大放異彩吧
You wanna look good for your lawyer award, right?

76
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:28,540
當然 盧克 其實我今天來是因為...
Uh, yes. Well, Luke, I am here under some

77
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:30,450
一些不愉快的事
unpleasant business.

78
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:36,250
我最近接了一位客戶 他受了重傷
I have been retained by a client who suffered serious injuries

79
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,910
因為他在你這買的戰服 出了質量問題
due to a dysfunctional suit that you sold him.

80
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,830
還沒正式提告呢 我覺得咱們是不是可以達成某種...
Nothing has been filed. I think we can come to some kind of...

81
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:42,950
你說什么
Excuse me?

82
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:45,290
你膽敢質疑我
How dare you.

83
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:49,450
我這輩子從來沒做過有缺陷的戰服 我的作品是完美無瑕的
I have never made a defective suit in all my life. My work is impeccable.

84
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:52,450
當然了 我可是深有體會 而且我...
Obviously, I know that firsthand. And I...

85
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:54,540
相信我 接這案子我也是迫不得已
Trust me, I'm not happy to be doing this.

86
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:55,660
我不相信你
I'm not trusting you

87
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:58,700
你鬼鬼祟祟溜進來 在我背后捅刀子
after you just lumbered in here and stabbed me in the back.

88
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,700
還沒正式提告呢
Well, there's no lawsuit yet.

89
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,040
而且你如果愿意
And there won't be

90
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:06,080
對我客戶造成的傷害承擔責任 就不用打官司了
if you just take some responsibility for some of my client's injuries.

91
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,580
我做的戰服絕對沒有質量問題
I do not make suits that malfunction.

92
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,290
我的作品能自證清白
My work speaks for itself.

93
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:12,950
不好意思 你剛才說什么
Oh, excuse me. What did you say?

94
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:15,580
這件要和我說話 稍等
She wants to tell me something, hold on.

95
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:21,410
“女浩克不配再穿 盧克·雅各布森做的衣服了 ”
"She-Hulk will never get another suit by Luke Jacobson ever again?"

96
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,410
嘿 這件我可是付了全款的
Hey, I pre-paid for that!

97
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,330
那你就不該背叛我
Then you shouldn't have betrayed me.

98
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:30,870
你被封殺了 我要拉黑你 即刻生效
You are blocked, blacklisted and reported!

99
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:32,330
那我別無選擇了
Now, I am gonna take you down.

100
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:36,250
對 我覺得你那些丑八怪衣服 確實沒什么可選擇的
Well, I hope it's not down to wherever it is you get your ugly clothes from.

101
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:38,450
法庭上見
See you in court!

102
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,000
能不能...
Can you...

103
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:41,450
再見 倒霉鬼
Goodbye, tragedy.

104
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:48,250
《律師女浩克》
第一季第八集

105
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:48,250
本WEB版外掛字幕由  風吹來的那片云  雙語合并

106
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:56,080
雅各布森先生 我發現你沒有律師
Mr. Jacobson, I see you are presently without counsel.

107
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,450
你是要自我辯護嗎
Are you representing yourself?

108
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,370
自我辯護
Representing himself?

109
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:03,000
你可以開始計劃 怎么花你那筆賠償金了
Start planning how you're gonna spend all your new money.

110
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,410
雅各布森先生
Mr. Jacobson?

111
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:09,580
我當然不是要自我辯護 法官閣下 我又不蠢
Of course I'm not representing myself, Your Honor. I'm not a fool.

112
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:11,500
那你的律師在哪
Then where is your counsel?

113
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:19,450
在這呢
I'm here.

114
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:24,450
非常抱歉我來晚了 法官大人 找車位有點難
Apologies for the tardiness, Your Honor. I had trouble finding parking.

115
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:28,000
開玩笑的 其實是我的司機迷路了
I'm just kidding. My driver got lost.

116
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,750
我叫馬修·默多克
My name is Matthew Murdock.

117
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:32,250
我是雅各布森先生本案的代理律師
I'll be representing Mr. Jacobson in this case.

118
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:33,660
抱歉 我遲到了
Hey. Sorry I'm late.

119
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,660
首先我要申請
As a first point of order, I'd like to ask that

120
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:39,450
駁回對方律師提出的 要求被告配合提供客戶名單的動議
the motion to compel production of the defendant's client list be rejected

121
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:41,500
因為這份名單與本案無關
as it's not relevant to the litigation.

122
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,950
這個混蛋是誰
Who's this asshole?

123
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:46,540
法官大人 我認為這份名單 絕對與本案的案情部分
Your Honor, I believe this information to be incredibly relevant

124
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:48,330
有非常密切的關系
given the nature of the complaint.

125
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:52,000
雅克布森先生服務的其他客戶 也很有可能
There could be multiple instances of Mr. Jacobson's other clients

126
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,250
因服裝缺陷的問題而受過傷
sustaining injuries from faulty merchandise.

127
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:56,830
我認為沃爾特斯小姐會看到
I believe Ms. Walters will find that Mr. Jacobson's record

128
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:59,450
雅各布森先生的客戶滿意度調查 是零差評記錄
as it pertains to customer satisfaction to be spotless.

129
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:03,370
既然被告行事如此光明磊落 那為何不聽聽客戶的評價呢
If the defendant has nothing to hide, then why not hear from his clients?

130
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:06,500
你的前提假設毫無根據 嚴重侵犯個人隱私
That's an invasion of privacy based on a very shaky "what if."

131
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:09,830
這只是與產品責任相關案件中的 常規取證
This is a very common procedure in product liability lawsuits.

132
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:11,410
此類功能缺陷是否導致其他人受傷
It is material to the case whether

133
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:14,040
與本案絕對有關
this type of malfunction has affected other people.

134
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,080
雇用雅各布森先生做衣服
There is no inherent right to privacy

135
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,620
本身并不涉及個人隱私的問題
when employing Mr. Jacobson's tailoring services.

136
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:20,620
但是本案涉及的并非普通產品
We're not just talking about a product here.

137
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:22,620
雅各布森先生的工作
The very nature of Mr. Jacobson's line of work,

138
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:26,290
是為超級英雄定制戰服 必須保證匿名性
making suits exclusively for superheroes, necessitates anonymity.

139
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:29,040
我要提醒對方 《索科維亞協議》已經被廢除了
May I remind you that the Sokovia Accords have been repealed.

140
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,410
超級英雄選擇走進大眾的視野
Superheroes operate in the public eye.

141
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:38,000
作為公眾人物 他們必然會犧牲掉某些個人隱私
As public figures, it is assumed that there will be some loss of privacy.

142
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,250
我們現在討論的并不是名人
We're not talking about celebrities,

143
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:43,160
而是超級英雄 他們的對手企圖傷害他們
but superheroes who have enemies who will try to harm them,

144
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:44,410
和他們身邊的人
and people close to them.

145
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,700
這些人都是無辜的 卻會受到牽連
The ones who didn't ask to be a part of this life.

146
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:49,200
沃爾特斯女士自愿公開身份
Ms. Walters chose to have her identity be public,

147
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,160
但是她無權代替其他人做出選擇
but she can't choose for everyone else.

148
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:53,250
這不僅僅關系到個人隱私
This isn't about privacy for privacy's sake.

149
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:57,040
如果這方面信息遭到泄露 不但會讓我的客戶身敗名裂
If this information is not protected, not only would it ruin my client's career,

150
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,290
還會讓許多人陷入各種各樣的危險
it could put a lot of people in a lot of danger,

151
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:01,450
而這些都是因為某個人 使用戰服不當造成的
and all over one man's misuse of a suit.

152
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:03,500
我贊同默多克先生的主張
I'm in agreement with Mr. Murdock.

153
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:07,160
原告提出的配合取證的動議 不予批準
Motion to compel discovery is denied.

154
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:09,700
等等 這是說 我別想再有新戰服了
Wait. Does that mean I don't get a new suit?

155
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:10,620
先坐下
Sit down!

156
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,620
什么 不行...看看我這身戰服
What, no... Look at this thing!

157
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:14,620
我以后還怎么穿啊
How am I supposed to wear this?

158
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:19,500
帕蒂利奧先生 你的助推器用的是什么燃料
Mr. Patilio, what kind of fuel did you use in your boosters?

159
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,580
噴氣機燃料
Jet fuel.

160
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:24,080
等等 你給戰服助推器 用的是噴氣機燃料
Wait a minute, you used jet fuel in your boosters?

161
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,370
我的使用說明書可不是這么寫的
Because that's not what my instructions said.

162
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:27,330
什么
What?

163
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:30,500
我沒用那個
No, I didn't.

164
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:33,660
他在說謊 別問我怎么知道的 我就是知道
He's lying. Don't ask me how I know, I just know.

165
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:36,080
是的 我們都看得出來他在說謊 默多克先生
Yes, we can all tell he's lying, Mr. Murdock.

166
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,620
如果原告未按商家提供的說明書 正確使用戰服
If the plaintiff ignored the manufacturer's explicit instructions,

167
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:44,000
這將免除掉被告的一切責任
then the defendant is absolved of all liability.

168
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,580
原告的訴訟請求被駁回
I'm dismissing this case.

169
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:47,200
我會不會坐牢啊
Am I gonna go to jail?

170
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,200
不會 但是我巴不得送你進去
No, but I would like you to.

171
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,410
-盧克 -干什么 小丑
- And Luke, Luke. - Yes, clown?

172
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,540
我就是想向你道個歉...
I just wanted to apologize for...

173
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:55,500
因為你居然敢質疑我的手藝
For daring to question my craftsmanship?

174
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:59,040
你還能不能繼續給我做衣服
Is there any way that we could go back to you being my tailor?

175
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,290
珍妮佛
Jennifer, Jenny, Jen.

176
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,580
不能 因為我現在非常討厭你
No. Because I hate you now.

177
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,450
案例酒吧

178
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:16,540
什么意思
What's this?

179
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:18,160
那位先生請您的
It's from that guy over there.

180
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,000
蘋果馬丁尼 我喜歡
An appletini? Cute.

181
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,120
介意我坐過來嗎
Mind if I join you?

182
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:25,950
隨你
Sure.

183
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,330
幫我拿一下好嗎
Would you mind?

184
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:35,330
我是來示好的
I wanted to extend a peace offering.

185
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,790
我最討厭那些 占領道德制高點的人了
Ugh! I hate it when people take the high road.

186
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:41,370
所以你到底是來干什么的 馬修·默多克
So, what's your story, Matt Murdock?

187
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:42,500
你不遠萬里從紐約飛過來
You're from New York

188
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,700
難道就為了個產品責任的小案子
but you flew all the way out here for a product liability case?

189
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:49,200
盧克·雅各布森給我做過幾套新衣服 我欠他的人情
Luke Jacobson made a couple of new suits for me, so I owed him one.

190
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,750
這我倒是沒看出來
Doesn't really look like it.

191
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:54,040
貶低一個盲人的著裝 也太不體面了
That's a low blow insulting a blind man's clothes.

192
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,540
我穿著褲子呢 對吧
I'm wearing pants, right?

193
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,370
你有自己的律所 對吧
You have your own practice, right?

194
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:03,410
沃爾特斯小姐 你調查過我的底細了
Ms. Walters, have you been checking up on me?

195
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,580
是啊 這能怪我嗎 你忽然冒出來
Yeah. Can you blame me? You came out of nowhere

196
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,160
然后讓我那個蠢貨客戶
and you made my dumb client admit

197
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:09,620
當庭承認他比我想象的還要蠢
to being even dumber than I thought he was in court.

198
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:11,290
你是怎么知道噴氣機燃料的
How did you know about the jet fuel?

199
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:13,000
直覺
A hunch.

200
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,830
話說那家伙是什么情況
What is his deal, by the way?

201
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:16,830
-你再來直覺一次試試 -好啊
- Well, I'll give you one guess. - Okay.

202
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:18,540
和“富爸爸”有關
It rhymes with "rich parents."

203
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:20,540
等等 我把答案說出來了
Wait, I said it was rich parents.

204
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:24,910
他父親是我們的重要客戶 所以他自然也是重要客戶了
His dad is a very important client, so he is a very important client.

205
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,370
好吧 聽過這句話嗎  “成全別人就是成全自己”
Well, you know the expression, "One for them, one for us"?

206
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:28,290
聽過
Yeah.

207
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:30,910
我在地獄廚房執業
Well, I run my practice in Hell's Kitchen,

208
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,200
大部分做的都是公益訴訟 這就是“成全自己”的部分
and we mostly do pro bono work. The "us" part.

209
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:37,450
但是我時不時也會接手 一些大客戶的案子
But I do on occasion take a job with a bigger client

210
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:41,000
他們的律師費給得很到位 這就是“成全別人”的部分
when the bills start piling up. The "them" part.

211
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,080
馬修·默多克的隱秘雙重生活 他是怎么做到的
Wow. Secret double lives of Matt Murdock, how does he do it?

212
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:48,370
作為一個全職“成全別人”的人
As someone who works for "them" full-time,

213
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:51,250
我可真沒精力再去干別的了
I really don't have any gas in the tank for anything else.

214
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,910
對 你說的沒錯
Yeah, you say that,

215
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,540
但是你的位置很特殊 你可以去日行一善啊
but I think you're in a unique position to do some real good.

216
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:00,250
我們是同道中人
You see, the way I see it,

217
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,580
珍妮佛·沃爾特斯可以利用法律 幫助那些被社會辜負的人
Jen Walters can use the law to help people when society fails them.

218
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:08,540
而女浩克可以幫助那些 被法律辜負的人
And She-Hulk can help people when the law fails them.

219
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,830
所以 你可以的 只要你愿意...
So, you can, if you choose...

220
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:14,910
這樣就能兩全其美了
Be the best of both worlds.

221
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:19,910
-我先失陪一下 -好
- Excuse me for a moment. - Yeah.

222
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:28,040
你們都有感覺了 對吧 不會只有我吧
We're all feeling this, right, it's not just me?

223
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:31,620
托德 - 我有個法律問題 需要立刻跟你討論

224
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:32,870
晚上8點在“馬蹄花”見

225
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:36,870
還記得托德嗎 那個惡心的科技宅 女浩克的崇拜狂
Ugh! You remember Todd, that gross tech bro with the She-Hulk fetish?

226
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:40,580
嘿 想不想再喝一杯
Hey, do you wanna get another round?

227
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:44,040
珍妮佛 我很抱歉 我得走了 有正事要辦
Jen, I am so sorry, I have to go. Something has just come up with work.

228
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:47,500
沒事 能理解 我也有正事
Oh, yeah. Totally. I got work, too.

229
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,950
沒事
- Yeah. - Um...

230
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:51,000
好吧 遇見你真的...
Uh, yeah, it was really...

231
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,410
很高興遇到你
It was nice meeting you.

232
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,870
我也是
Yeah, you, too.

233
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:06,500
托德 - 古利庫霍律所承諾 隨時為我服務

234
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,910
我可以給霍利韋打電話 確認一下是不是我弄錯了

235
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:09,830
好吧
Okay.

236
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:13,000
費爾普斯先生
Mr. Phelps.

237
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:15,450
什么先生...叫我托德
Mr... It's Todd.

238
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:20,540
所以 你要和我討論 什么十萬火急的事
So, what is the urgent matter that you wanted to discuss with me?

239
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:24,120
對...我最近在拍賣會上看藝術品
Oh, yeah... So, I was at an auction recently buying art

240
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:29,200
然后收了這個 真品瓦坎達戰矛
and then, get this, they had an authentic Wakandan war spear.

241
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:34,080
我當然最后拿下了 花了一百個
So, I, of course, win the auction. A millie.

242
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,700
一百萬
It's a million.

243
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:42,750
-是美金 -我聽明白了
- Dollars. - I got that.

244
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:45,330
好吧 那你肯定想見識一下 對吧
Yeah. So... I mean, you gotta see it, right?

245
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:48,040
我這有照片 給你看看
So, here it is. Check this out.

246
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,120
砰 是不是很酷
Boom. How cool is that?

247
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,790
這東西現在是我的了
I mean, I own that now.

248
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:55,910
天啊 論非洲收藏品 沒人能跟我媲美了
God, no one is collecting African shit on my level.

249
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,700
我太喜歡了 我愛瓦坎達 知道嗎 我去那留過學
I love it. I love Wakanda. You know, I actually studied abroad there.

250
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:01,620
真的嗎
Really?

251
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:03,620
瓦坎達萬歲
Wakanda Forever!

252
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:06,160
我...這有點尷尬了
Ooh! I... That makes me uncomfortable.

253
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:09,290
你在購買過程中遇到法律問題了
So, is there a legal issue with your purchase?

254
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:12,830
沒有 不過 是的 他們想要回去
No, no. Well, okay, they want it back

255
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:16,000
因為顯然這是被殖民者偷出來的
because apparently it was stolen by colonizers,

256
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,620
但是關我什么事 我有購買收據
but whatever. I mean, I got the receipts.

257
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:26,620
知道嗎 聽著 寶貝
You know, listen, babe.

258
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:30,040
咱們就別藏著掖著的了 我這個人本來也不喜歡兜圈子
Let's just drop the whole coy thing 'cause I don't play games, okay?

259
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,750
我對你有意思 我知道你對我也有...
And I can feel it and I can tell that we're both feeling it.

260
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,500
沒有
Ugh! No!

261
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:39,950
再見 我會按一整個小時計費的
Goodbye. Oh, and I'm billing you for the whole hour.

262
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:44,160
什么
What?

263
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:02,870
天啊
Oh, God.

264
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,450
-喂  -謝天謝地 沃爾特斯小姐 我是跳蛙
- Hello? - Thank God! Ms. Walters, it's Leapfrog.

265
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:08,910
聽著 你得來救我 我覺得有人要攻擊我
Listen, you gotta help me. I think I'm being attacked.

266
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,370
是法律上還是現實中
Legally or physically?

267
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:13,830
當然是在現實中 但是我覺得法律上應該也有
Definitely physically. But, I mean, maybe legally, too.

268
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:15,040
你在哪
Where are you?

269
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,830
我正在去荷葉的路上
I'm on my way to the Lily Pad.

270
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,040
那是個地名嗎
Is that a place I'm supposed to know?

271
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,790
對 是我最有名的秘密基地
Yeah. It's my famous secret lair.

272
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,750
我得去找我的朋友們
Yeah, I just need to find my friends.

273
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:26,580
好的 我爭取在停車場這里甩掉他
Okay, I'm gonna try to lose him in this parking lot.

274
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:28,250
-估計會沒信號 -你離我不遠
- I'm gonna lose ya. - You're close.

275
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:30,410
我現在往你那去 咱們路上見
I'm heading to you. We'll meet in the middle.

276
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,330
快點
Hurry!

277
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,080
我的車
My car!

278
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:58,450
別多管閑事
You need to back off.

279
00:14:58,450 --> 00:14:59,750
那這身戰服豈不是浪費了
And waste this outfit?

280
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:01,250
尤金 給我躲開
Eugene, get out of here.

281
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:02,330
戰服真不賴
Dope supersuit!

282
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:03,580
你會后悔的
You're making a mistake.

283
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:06,580
敢動我的客戶 后悔的是你
You made a mistake when you messed with my client!

284
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:08,660
小心我把你屁股揍開花
'Cause now I'm gonna whoop your ass.

285
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,450
我的屁股完好無損啊
Huh. My ass remains unwhooped.

286
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,450
是嗎 那我動真格的了
Yeah? Let's fix that.

287
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:29,080
怒蛙咆哮 全部干掉
Ribbit and rip it!

288
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:32,500
想往哪跑 還沒打完呢
Where are you going? We're not done.

289
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,080
你挺執著的呀
You're very persistent, aren't you?

290
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:36,250
你挺招人煩的
And you're very annoying.

291
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,000
回頭見
See you later!

292
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:50,700
來啊
Come on!

293
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:56,120
抓住你了
Gotcha.

294
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:00,250
珍妮佛
Whoa, whoa! Jen!

295
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:03,080
馬修
Matt?

296
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:10,910
等等 你不會是裝瞎吧 老兄  是的話問題可就嚴重了
Wait. Do you pretend to be blind, man? 'Cause that is really problematic.

297
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,660
不 我是真的看不見 冷靜一下 我...
No. No, no, I'm blind, I'm blind. Relax. I...

298
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:16,370
我利用空間感知法看見周圍的情況
I have a spatial method that I use to see.

299
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,540
類似回聲定位
Oh, like echolocation?

300
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:23,250
對 差不多吧 這個... 簡單來說就是我聽力超凡
Yeah, kind of. It's... Basically I have really good hearing.

301
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:24,620
至少曾經是
Or at least I did.

302
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:26,370
等等 你為什么要襲擊我的客戶
Wait, why were you attacking my client?

303
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:27,790
跳蛙才是幕后黑手
Leapfrog is the bad guy here.

304
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:30,120
他綁架了盧克·雅各布森 拿他當人質
He kidnapped Luke Jacobson. He's holding him hostage.

305
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,160
那我們開打之前你怎么不告訴我
Why didn't you tell me that before we fought?

306
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:35,700
你要把我屁股揍開花之前怎么不問我
Why didn't you ask me before trying to whoop my ass?

307
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:39,080
對不起 我把穿得像惡魔的人 直接當成壞人了
I'm sorry that I assumed the guy dressed as the devil was the bad one.

308
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,200
這個理由挺充分的
Yeah, that's a fair point.

309
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,580
那么你也是超級英雄嗎
So, are you, like, a superhero?

310
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:48,080
比如說金惡魔
Like the Gold Devil?

311
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:50,790
我是夜魔俠
I'm Daredevil.

312
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:57,370
番茄醬和芥末醬的配色 確實挺大膽啊
It is very daring to use ketchup and mustard as your color scheme.

313
00:16:57,370 --> 00:16:58,540
要幫你轉達盧克嗎
How 'bout I tell Luke?

314
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:00,000
不要 千萬別
No! No, please don't.

315
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,080
好吧 要是你取笑夠了 我得去你的客戶那救我的客戶了
Okay. Well, if you're done making fun, I need to save my client from your client.

316
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,580
好吧 咱們走吧
Okay, yeah, let's go.

317
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,790
你之前砸過停車場嗎
You ever destroy a parking lot before?

318
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:10,040
糟糕 我去留個紙條
Crap. I'll go leave a note.

319
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:13,160
荷葉

320
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:15,410
夠隱蔽的
Hmm. Subtle.

321
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:19,080
第二版的話 咱們可得把真本事全用上
For version two, we gotta go all out.

322
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:22,000
加一個防彈盾牌
I'm talking bulletproof shields,

323
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,080
內置英國口音實時互動的人工智能
fancy AI with a British voice that talks to you.

324
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:29,120
對了 再來幾只毒飛鏢 用樹蛙的造型
Oh, snap! And some of those poison darts, like the tree frogs.

325
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:32,500
我不知道是誰告訴你 你能駕馭得了這種配色
I don't know who told you that you could pull off this color,

326
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,620
但是你應該去找他們 然后斃了他們
but you should go back to them and shoot them.

327
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:40,790
我說 你被我綁來這里 肯定對我很不爽
Look, I know you're just being mean because I kidnapped you,

328
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:43,330
但是多少積點口德 哥們
but words hurt, man.

329
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:47,790
弟兄們 你們覺得“彈跳小隊” 這個名字怎么樣
Guys, what do we think about the name "Leap Squad"?

330
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:49,450
就叫“彈跳小隊”
You know, like, "Leap Squad!"

331
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:52,250
這種蠢貨居然也有跟班
I can't believe this dodo has henchmen.

332
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:55,120
其實這不奇怪 我敢賭這幫打手都是替他爸賣命的
Actually, I can. I bet these goons work for his dad.

333
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,160
不對 你完全弄錯了
Nah, see, that's where you're wrong.

334
00:17:57,250 --> 00:18:00,000
跟班和打手是截然不同的兩類人
Goons and henchmen are two completely different animals.

335
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,200
跟班認為他們是在搞事業 而打手只是來掙錢的
Henchmen believe in the cause, goons are just there for the paycheck.

336
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,790
跟班 打手 隨便吧
Henchmen, goons, whatever.

337
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,870
這棟樓里有二十五個打手
There are 25 goons in the building.

338
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:11,790
樓下七個 樓上八個 還有十個在走廊
Seven below us, eight in the front, and 10 in the hallway.

339
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:13,200
你怎么知道的
How do you know that?

340
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,700
我能聽見他們的心跳
I can hear their heartbeats.

341
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:19,450
你能聽到他們的心跳  得了吧 這有點太扯了
You can hear their heartbeats? Come on, that's a little far-fetched.

342
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:27,450
我也能聽見你的 你的心跳有點快啊
I can hear yours, too. Your heart's beating pretty fast.

343
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:31,540
什么
What?

344
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:33,250
什么 不 才沒有 我心臟好著呢
What? No, it's not. I'm healthy.

345
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:36,120
好吧
Okay.

346
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:39,450
我先潛入進去 搞定后面那幾個
I'll sneak in and take out the goons in the back.

347
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:41,250
一個差不多十五秒吧
It'll take me 15 seconds for each one.

348
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:43,160
我去把那十個都解決了 你在這等我
So, wait here until I've gotten all 10.

349
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:46,620
我可不想在這等上半個小時 看著你把他們挨個干掉
I'm not gonna sit here for half an hour while you pick off goons one by one.

350
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:48,200
你數學這么差啊
That's not how that math works out.

351
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,330
我可是個浩克 干嗎不讓我一路砸過去
I'm a Hulk. How about I just smash our way in?

352
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:51,830
可是他們有槍 珍妮佛
They have weapons, Jennifer.

353
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:54,540
巧了 女浩克正好是刀槍不入的 馬修
Yeah, good thing She-Hulk is indestructible, Matthew.

354
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:57,040
潛入才是上策 我干過無數次了
Stealth's the way to go. I've done this a million times.

355
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,250
你闖進過全是暴徒的倉庫嗎
Have you broken into a warehouse full of goons?

356
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:01,450
那你告訴我咱倆誰有超能力
Remind me again who has the superpowers here?

357
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:03,080
我是指著自己問的
I'm pointing at myself.

358
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:05,790
對 我知道 我會回聲定位 忘了嗎
Oh, yeah, I know. I have echolocation, remember?

359
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:07,000
讓我先把正事干了
Just let me do my thing.

360
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,410
好 那我也去忙了
Yeah, and I will do my thing.

361
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:13,750
你...你沒什么可忙的吧 你根本就沒經驗
You... You don't have a thing. You don't ever do this.

362
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:17,080
聽我指揮就行
Just follow my lead.

363
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,620
好吧 這樣也挺好
Okay, I guess that's pretty cool.

364
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:27,040
我想說 我尊重你打扮成青蛙的想法
So, I said I respect that you wanna dress up like a frog,

365
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,500
但是這不代表我想當只小蛙仔啊
but that doesn't mean I'm cool with being a baby frog.

366
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,910
等等 他是想讓咱們當“蝌蚪”吧
Wait, I thought he wanted to call us "Tadpoles."

367
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:32,830
沒錯 哥們
Yeah, man.

368
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:34,410
你怎么連青蛙幼崽都不知道...
How do you not know what...

369
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:08,000
蝌蚪五號 請講
GOON 2 ON WALKIE: Tadpole five, come in.

370
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,450
后門這邊需要增援 我們被...
We need backup at the rear entrance. We got...

371
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:11,870
蝌蚪五號 請重復
Tadpole five, repeat.

372
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:16,500
頂住 增援馬上就到
Hang tight, backup's on the way.

373
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:40,830
女浩克暴擊
She-Hulk smash.

374
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
還有這么多跟班和打手
Ugh! More hench-goons?

375
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:58,370
要不散伙算了
How about we don't?

376
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:00,500
嘿 那可是古董
Whoa! Hey! That's vintage!

377
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:06,660
嘿 你在干什么 你應該幫我才對
Hey, what are you doing? You're supposed to be helping me.

378
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:10,660
我就是在幫你啊 我在阻止你惹出更大的麻煩
I am helping you. I'm stopping you from getting into even more trouble.

379
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,290
去報警
Go call the police.

380
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:17,250
別沖我嚷嚷 我已經被嚇得夠嗆了
Don't you yell at me. I'm already very stressed out.

381
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:19,910
尤金 我給你點專業意見吧
Eugene, let me give you some legal advice.

382
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,950
在你還沒犯下更重的罪之前 立刻停手
Stop now, before you rack up even more serious charges.

383
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:25,700
法律層面上 我們可以用狂躁癥作為借口
Legally speaking, we could say this is an episode of mania...

384
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:28,500
暫時性精神錯亂很難證明 但是你這個策略還不錯
Temporary insanity is murky, but it's not a bad strategy.

385
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:33,370
我更傾向于歸咎為因未確診的 創傷后遺癥導致的應激障礙行為
I'd angle this more as a form of traumatic expression due to undiagnosed PTSD.

386
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:36,120
所以這個惡魔忍者也是個律師
So, the devil ninja guy, he's a lawyer?

387
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,950
不是 就是喜歡看律政題材電視劇
No. I'm just a big fan of legal dramas.

388
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:40,660
這話我可太愛聽了
This guy's really kinda doing it for me.

389
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:45,660
你居然以為這玩意能對付我
It's sad that you thought that would work.

390
00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:49,870
以退為進知道嗎
No shame in retreat.

391
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:51,950
怒蛙咆哮 全部干掉
Ribbit and rip it! Oh!

392
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:06,200
好吧 看來這下我們扯平了 那我就原諒你吧
Well, well, well, I suppose we're even now. You're forgiven.

393
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,830
那你會給我做晚宴禮服嗎
So, you'll make my gala dress?

394
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,580
當然了 我又不是冷血動物
Yes, of course. I'm not a monster.

395
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:15,410
這段時間記得控制體型
Try not to get too bloated between now and then.

396
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:22,450
真高興和那個又專業又刻薄的人 重歸于好啦
Great to be strained professional acquaintances again.

397
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:38,500
你要去給警察做份筆錄嗎
Are you gonna give a statement to the cops?

398
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:41,370
我這種人一向都是繞著警察走的
I'm not really a stick around and talk to the cops kinda guy.

399
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,160
積怨挺深啊
Oh, so brooding.

400
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:48,120
主要和我的秘密身份有關 你不會懂的
More of a secret identity thing. - You wouldn't understand.

401
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:53,870
今天的這一切 多虧你的幫助
Thanks for your help with all of this.

402
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,750
也謝謝你的幫助
Thanks for your help.

403
00:22:57,450 --> 00:22:59,160
不 主要還是你的功勞
No. You're the one who helped me.

404
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:02,080
不 我只是帶頭的超級英雄而已
No. I was the lead superhero on this.

405
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:05,160
你才是那個花了半小時
Uh, you were they guy who wanted to spend half an hour

406
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:07,580
挨個解決打手們的男人
picking off each goon, one by one.

407
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:10,540
那你就是那個 造成嚴重財物損壞的女人
You were the woman who caused excessive property damage.

408
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:12,660
而且到現在也沒算明白數
And you still can't get that math right.

409
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:16,950
你什么時候回紐約
When do you head to New York?

410
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:20,620
明天
- Tomorrow. - Oh... Well...

411
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:30,160
嘿 也許下次我過來的時候 可以請你吃個飯
Hey, maybe next time I'm in town, I can take you out to dinner.

412
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:33,620
好啊 沒準也可以省略掉那些環節 直接...
Yeah, or maybe we can skip all of that and just...

413
00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:51,660
別管它 沒事的
That's all right. That's okay.

414
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:53,750
等等 你是不是得...好了 來吧
Wait, you have to... All right, here you go.

415
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:55,160
好 來吧
Okay. Let's go.

416
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:18,870
早上好
Good morning.

417
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:30,620
真奇怪 你們居然還在
It's weird you guys are still here.

418
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,700
本集不是應該到這就結束了嗎
Doesn't it feel like this episode should be over?

419
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:36,790
你好
Hello! Uh...

420
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:41,580
你怎么不接我電話  我還以為你死了
Why didn't you answer my calls? I thought that you were dead.

421
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,660
然后我得破門而入呢 對了
I had to break and enter. By the way,

422
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:46,040
外面有個男的 穿著一身惡魔的戲服
there's some guy outside dressed in a devil costume

423
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:48,330
看他那模樣就知道他昨天晚上...
and he's doing the walk of shame 'cause he's...

424
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,790
是你...和那個...
Oh. You did... With the...

425
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:52,870
對
Yes.

426
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:54,330
好吧 感覺挺好
Oh, all right. And we're happy?

427
00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:55,660
-感覺很好 -好吧
- Oh, we're happy. - Okay.

428
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:57,160
好吧 你這個小惡魔
All right. You're the devil.

429
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:01,040
說真的 這場戲是干什么的
Seriously, what is this scene?

430
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:05,330
這集已經圓滿結束了 相信我
This episode already came to a very satisfying conclusion. Trust me.

431
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:07,290
快點 咱們該走了 晚點再給我講
Come on! We gotta go. Tell me about it later.

432
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:10,000
得先把你的發型和化妝搞定 盧克給你做的禮服在哪
We have to do your hair and your makeup. Where is the gown from Luke?

433
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:11,950
晚宴禮服嗎
Oh, for the gala?

434
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:15,040
等等 這就要拍晚宴了  感覺有點不對吧
Wait, we're doing the gala? That doesn't feel right.

435
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,870
下一集不是大結局嗎
Is next episode the finale?

436
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:18,450
快點 走吧
Come on. Let's go.

437
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:23,120
感覺好像是在本季結束前 狗尾續貂地加一段戲
Just like a tacked-on set piece near the end of the season.

438
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,790
不會是要來個劇情大反轉吧  可問題是
This is the big twist, isn't it? But the question is,

439
00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:27,450
是什么樣的反轉呢
is it the kind of twist that's like,

440
00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:29,330
比如 “又出現了一個浩克 但是這次是紅色的”
"There's another Hulk, but this one's red,"

441
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:31,120
再比如 “把我寫死了 ”
or like, "I'm getting fridged?"

442
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:34,500
保證讓你大放異彩
We gotta make you look amazing.

443
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:36,500
我無所謂 重在參與
Whatever. I'm game.

444
00:26:07,290 --> 00:26:12,160
親愛的 你怎么不帶個外套  萬一著涼了怎么辦
Sweetheart. You didn't bring a jacket? What if you get cold?

445
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:15,160
她可以穿我的 伊萊恩 我們真為你感到驕傲
She can wear mine, Elaine. We are so proud of you.

446
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:17,790
-謝謝你 老爸 -你的外套她穿不下 莫里斯
- Thank you, Dad. - Your jacket won't fit her, Morris.

447
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:20,910
絕對不能把盧克·雅各布森的 祖海·慕拉系列遮住
You can't cover up a Luke Jacobson-Zuhair Murad collaboration.

448
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,120
-妮基 -這名字可真拗口
Nikki! That's certainly a mouthful.

449
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,830
我有點緊張
I'm a little nervous.

450
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,450
好啦 咱們去里面坐吧
Okay. Let's find our table.

451
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:29,700
-對 他來了 你好 -咱們走吧 來吧
- Yeah. There he is. Hi! - Let's go. Come on.

452
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:30,790

So special and empowering. I love it.

469
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:14,660
吃雙份的苦 名氣是別人的一半
Twice the work, half the recognition,

470
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:18,290
還總有人問你 作為一名女性律師有何感受
and you're constantly being asked what it's like being a female lawyer.

471
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:19,250
說得好
Yeah.

472
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:25,790
其實我想借此機會感謝我的父母
I'd actually like to take this time to thank my parents.

She-Hulk does not deserve your attention. She does not deserve your praise.

480
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:51,160
更不配擁有從浩克那里 竊取的超能力
She does not deserve the power she stole from the Hulk.

481
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:53,410
