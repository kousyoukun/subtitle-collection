1
00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:03,120
She-Hulk? She-Hulk. She-Hulk.

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,870
Lady-Hulk, Girl-Hulk, She-Hulk. Give 'em what they want.

3
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:07,200
Previously on She-Hulk...

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,660
That name better not stick.

5
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:10,700
What if you made a profile as She-Hulk?

6
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:13,620
I'm not proud of this.

7
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,910
Is there anything worse than dating in your 30s?

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,410
I have to admit, I was a fan.

9
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,950
I mean, your battle with Titania in court,

10
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:22,330
- it was incredible.

11
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,040
Supporters of the Free Titania movement are celebrating

12
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,330
- that she's been cleared of all charges. - Boo.

13
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:33,000
I've got court documents filed by Titania Worldwide LLC.

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:33,910
She's suing me over the name "She-Hulk"?

15
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,040
But that's my name.

16
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:19,250
Strength is beauty. Beauty is strength.

17
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:20,700
What makes you beautiful?

18
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,830
She-Hulk by Titania.

19
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:26,080
Be strong, be beautiful. Own who you are.

20
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,500
She-Hulk by Titania.

21
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,000
I am strength. I am beauty.

22
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,200
I own who I am.

23
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,200
She-Hulk by Titania,

24
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,660
a luxurious new line of skin care, beauty, and wellness products

25
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:41,750
created by Titania exclusively for you.

26
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:43,700
She-Hulk by Titania.

27
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:55,500
You're listening to Pro Say, Law 360's podcast.

28
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,120
A quick word from our sponsor.

29
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,370
Hey, Titaniacs, can't wait to see you all.

30
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:11,870
- Ched! - Yo. What's up, Jen?

31
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:13,580
You can't just walk into my house!

32
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:16,080
What do you want me to tell you? I just did.

33
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,080
I'm making a killing selling these signed She-Hulk products.

34
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,580
They love you. The people love the She-Hulk.

35
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:24,750
- So I need your John Hancock for me. - I'm not signing those.

36
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:27,870
What do you mean? I'm supporting your business venture.

37
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:30,410
No, this is not mine. It has nothing to do with me.

38
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:35,910
- It's got your name here on the label. - This is someone else.

39
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,120
This woman, Titania, has trademarked my name.

40
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,200
That's dumb. Why would you let her do that?

41
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,040
I didn't let her, Ched.

42
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:47,120
You know, Jen,

43
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:50,160
the way trademark works is,

44
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:52,200
whoever gets there first, gets it.

45
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:56,200
So if you would've done yours first, she wouldn't have been able to do that.

46
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:04,250
Thank you.

47
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,910
She tweeted that she'd be here connecting with her fans.

48
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,870
You follow her?

49
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:15,040
It's for reconnaissance. Where are you going?

50
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,620
- To talk to her. - Yeah, we are.

51
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:18,500
But we're not waiting in line. You kidding?

52
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,160
We enter with confidence. That's how it works. Excuse us.

53
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,000
What is this?

54
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,870
"Snake venom lip plumper."

55
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,540
She's literally selling snake oil.

56
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:35,250
"Beauty serum."

57
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:38,290
"Beauty oil."

58
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:43,290
"Beauty tonic." How are these not all exactly the same thing?

59
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:45,620
Are you kidding? They're completely different.

60
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:46,540
Free samples?

61
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:49,660
These are all for me and that girl.

62
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:52,080
- Thank you so much, thank you.

63
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:58,450
I'm so sorry, little child, but the line starts way back there.

64
00:03:58,450 --> 00:03:59,370
I don't wanna cut.

65
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:03,250
I want you to stop, and take all of this down.

66
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,330
What's the issue?

67
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:09,120
You're using my name to sell your trashy products, and you're suing me?

68
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,700
Get over it, Jennifer. The name She-Hulk is mine.

69
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:13,790
Excuse me?

70
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:15,660
Could you take a photo?

71
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:19,660
Oh, my God, yes. Back up a little bit. Just give me some space.

72
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,250
- She's gonna... - You taking it?

73
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:22,870
Just one, and that is it.

74
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,330
I can't believe she stole my name.

75
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:27,830
But you said you didn't like that name anyways.

76
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:29,450
- I don't. - Okay.

77
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:32,620
It's just what people decided to call me. It's not who I am.

78
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,700
I'm still Jennifer Walters.

79
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:37,290
She-Hulk is just a thing that happened to me.

80
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:41,830
- That's a really good perspective to have. - I admit there are parts that I enjoy.

81
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:45,080
- Okay, you're not done. - Like the amazing hair, no hangover.

82
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,700
Walking home with headphones on without being afraid.

83
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:50,330
- Every woman's dream. - But I'm not a different person

84
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:51,580
who needs a different name.

85
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:53,950
Okay. So you're not mad at the name She-Hulk?

86
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:55,370
No, I don't care about it.

87
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:59,290
- Okay. So you're totally over it? - Yeah, like, the most over it.

88
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,000
You're crushing your stapler.

89
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:03,700
What?

90
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:09,540
Why does she have to charge her fans so much for everything?

91
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:13,500
Because that's smart, Nikki. That's why she is rich and you're broke.

92
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,290
What's happening, Nik?

93
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:19,330
Oh, I was just talking to myself.

94
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:22,290
I can't pretend I'm here for a friendly visit. I need a favor.

95
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:24,160
Oh. well, you know my price.

96
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:27,120
- Return favor. Plus interest. - Done.

97
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,910
- Okay. - Stand in line with me

98
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,620
waiting for a sneaker drop?

99
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:34,830
The Iron Man Threes are coming out. They're limited to one pair per customer.

100
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:36,330
Why do you need two pairs?

101
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:38,370
One to rock and one to stock.

102
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,790
Okay, so you're telling me that you collect shoes

103
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:43,750
to look at that you're never gonna wear?

104
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:46,620
I respect that.

105
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:48,700
I'm not gonna brag to you or anything,

106
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:51,450
but I do have some pretty rare limited editions

107
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:54,830
that I got from my drip broker.

108
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:58,750
Through your... Excuse me, your what?

109
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:01,870
Yeah, I got a guy, Alonzo, the drip broker.

110
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:04,790
He can find anything you're looking for, fashion-wise.

111
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:10,370
Can this drip broker find someone who could do custom clothing

112
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:13,660
for, say, a super-human sized person?

113
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:18,450
No doubt.

114
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:22,160
Okay. I'm gonna need to call in my favor right now.

115
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:25,830
- You haven't done my favor. - I'm letting you slide on the interest.

116
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:26,910
You're right.

117
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:31,160
- You're right. Slick Nik. Slick Nik.

118
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:36,120
I just wanted to thank all of my beloved Titaniacs

119
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,790
- for helping me reach my... - I'm over it. I really am.

120
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:48,040
Alonzo says that it's a front for a superhero clothing business.

121
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:51,950
Okay.

122
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,370
- Hi, are you ready to order? - Hey, how you doing, man?

123
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:59,790
My boy Alonzo sent me.

124
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:01,620
Alonzo. Okay, what's the order?

125
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:05,750
No, no. My boy, Alonzo,

126
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:07,870
the drip broker.

127
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:09,750
He sent me.

128
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:14,290
For the superhero stuff.

129
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,540
What is that, Chinese? I'm not Chinese.

130
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:25,580
Well, I said we're not cops.

131
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:29,040
And I said it in Chinese.

132
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:33,370
I feel so much shame.

133
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:37,790
- He's mad. I offended him. I... - Okay.

134
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,370
Come to the back.

135
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:45,580
- All right. - Creepy back-room situation.

136
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,540
- This kind of hustle. - Okay.

137
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:52,540
What do you need? I got everything.

138
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:56,080
Captain America shield, Thor hammer.

139
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:58,580
Avengers T-shirt.

140
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:00,790
This says, "Avongers."

141
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,580
You don't like Avongers? I got Avingers.

142
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:05,000
Oh, with an I.

143
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:06,620
I kind of like this.

144
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:09,870
Okay, no, we don't want bootleg stuff, okay?

145
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:12,410
I want custom-made clothing for a superhero.

146
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:17,830
Question, if you're not the guy, then do you know who the guy is?

147
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,580
He won't meet you. He's exclusive.

148
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:22,080
Okay. So you do know the guy.

149
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:31,080
Okay, fine. I'll buy one of your Avongers T-shirts.

150
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:34,000
- And a matching hat. - Yes, I wanna complete the ensemble.

151
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:41,370
Okay.

152
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:43,500
No.

153
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:50,120
Hi.

154
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:53,700
I wanted to talk to you about making clothing for my client...

155
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:55,000
Do you have a referral?

156
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,080
Titania referred me.

157
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:06,370
I saw you shrug. Rejected.

158
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:13,620
Actually, my client is an Avenger.

159
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,620
- She's one of the top-tier ones, sir. - Yes.

160
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,660
Fifteen-minute consultation. My assistant will set up the appointment.

161
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:29,950
I can still see you.

162
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:33,540
- Okay. Okay. - Yes, sir. Thank you.

163
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:45,870
Is everything all right, sir?

164
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:47,950
No.

165
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:56,080
Why did I pass a billboard on Santa Monica Boulevard today

166
00:09:56,580 --> 00:10:01,040
advertising a She-Hulk booty boost smoothie?

167
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:04,870
Oh, so, that's not actually me.

168
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:09,410
So that name was never really mine, officially.

169
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,950
Everyone in the media just started calling me that.

170
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:16,950
But now this incredibly awful, slightly super-powered woman...

171
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:21,120
Uh, yeah, I'm gonna stop you, 'cause none of that's my concern.

172
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:23,700
Okay.

173
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:26,450
GLK and H made She-Hulk the face

174
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:28,290
of our superhuman law division.

175
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:32,410
And now, we find ourselves in the middle of a frivolous lawsuit.

176
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:36,660
No one hires a firm that can't handle its own messes.

177
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:43,620
I am going to fix this, sir.

178
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,290
No, you won't.

179
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:49,330
I'm surprised and relieved you aren't foolish enough

180
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:50,700
to try to represent yourself.

181
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,500
At least you know that basic rule.

182
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:56,040
I'm taking this on as a professional courtesy,

183
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,540
but moving forward, we are not colleagues.

184
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:02,040
I'm the attorney, you're the client. That's the only way this can work.

185
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:02,950
Agreed?

186
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:04,750
Agreed.

187
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,700
Why didn't you trademark your pseudonym?

188
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:10,450
I never even thought about it, you know? Why would I?

189
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:13,750
Did Doctor Strange have to trademark his name? Did Thor?

190
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:16,580
You chose two examples of people who use their real names.

191
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:23,910
This is the person who legally outmaneuvered you?

192
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:25,370
Yeah.

193
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:27,660
Yeah.

194
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:32,580
We need to show strength. Countersue.

195
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:34,200
Establish you were using the name

196
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,830
in a professional capacity before the trademark date,

197
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:39,040
and Titania is profiting off name recognition

198
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,950
already established in the marketplace.

199
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:43,910
If you're gonna be my client, dress like you respect yourself,

200
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,700
and not like a football player pleading no contest to a DUI.

201
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:47,830
Nikki?

202
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:51,410
Yes? Wasn't lurking. I was close by.

203
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:55,450
You obviously spend a lot of time thinking about what you wear.

204
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:58,750
- Why don't you help her? - I'm actually already on top of that.

205
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:03,000
I got you a consultation with the guy who makes clothing for superheroes.

206
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:05,450
- Oh, I don't think I really need that. - You do, yeah.

207
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:13,160
Nice suit, Shrek.

208
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:16,790
All rise. Court is now in session.

209
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:25,080
Your Honor, we move to dismiss this entirely frivolous suit.

210
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:28,000
My client owns the trademark for She-Hulk.

211
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,790
Ms. Book may enjoy wasting the court's time,

212
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:33,040
but you can be certain that I do not.

213
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,250
Ms. Book?

214
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:35,620
Thank you, Your Honor.

215
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,540
As you will see, there are no issues of fact here

216
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:40,790
that would require proceeding to trial.

217
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:45,410
Since the first public appearance of Jennifer Walters in her Hulk form,

218
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:51,200
the public has unanimously identified her with the name She-Hulk.

219
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:54,200
In fact, the name had not even been recorded

220
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,500
in public discourse until that debut.

221
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:59,620
We have a number of news items and broadcast quotes

222
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:01,540
I'd like to enter into record.

223
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:03,450
Simply put,

224
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,120
the defendant is exploiting goodwill towards my client

225
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,620
and her better-known cousin,

226
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:13,540
in order to sell her non-FDA approved sham products.

227
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,910
We ask the court to grant our motion

228
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,700
for summary judgment, and order our requested remedies.

229
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,120
Okay.

230
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:23,080
First of all, "sham"?

231
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:27,080
Why don't you try telling that to the thousands of testimonials

232
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:30,250
from my fans who have had nothing but amazing results

233
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:33,330
with my exclusive line of She-Hulk Foot Exfoliants,

234
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:35,910
which I just so happen to have a little sample of,

235
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,950
and offer into evidence, thank you.

236
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:39,330
No, we don't need...

237
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,120
Can we please stay on track here?

238
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,870
What my client is trying to say is that She-Hulk was not...

239
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:45,870
You can sit down.

240
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:50,290
What my client is trying to say is that Ms. Walters was not interested

241
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:52,700
in the She-Hulk name until it became associated

242
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:55,750
with this incredibly successful line of products.

243
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:57,290
If we may.

244
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:00,790
- She-Hulk! Hey, She-Hulk! - I will not answer to that name.

245
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:02,870
You know why? 'Cause it's not my name.

246
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:03,870
She-Hulk! She-Hulk!

247
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:07,000
My name never has been, and never will be She-Hulk.

248
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:10,330
It's lazy, it's reductive, and it's straight-up garbage.

249
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:13,000
Any response, Ms. Book?

250
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:16,160
Actually, yes. We have one more clip to show.

251
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:21,040
Tell us, how did you come up with the name She-Hulk?

252
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,950
Some random guy on the news came up with it.

253
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:27,160
But it stuck, and so now, whether I like it or not,

254
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:29,700
I am forever She-Hulk.

255
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,660
My client clearly stated that she is She-Hulk.

256
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,660
This is just one instance.

257
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,580
Can you prove a pattern of Ms. Walter's personal use of the name?

258
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,830
Yes, Your Honor, we definitely have more to present.

259
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:44,750
You'd better.

260
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,830
Or I'm inclined to side with the defendant.

261
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:48,540
We'll recess until Thursday.

262
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:55,700
- Appointment for She-Hulk.

263
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,040
- We told him you're an Avenger. - What?

264
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,660
...all of the care instructions on the tag.

265
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:05,450
I will not be held responsible for customer stupidity.

266
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:07,120
This one.

267
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,500
Oh, my God!

268
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,160
Is the hag convention in town?

269
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,620
Luke, Nikki Ramos. This is the She-Hulk.

270
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:23,040
- Jennifer Walters. - Never heard of you.

271
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,120
My client list is very exclusive because my work is impeccable.

272
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:29,250
Well, like I told you before, she's gonna be one of the Avengers.

273
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:32,370
- You said she was one. - It hasn't been announced yet.

274
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:34,790
They're still working out the deal, but she is.

275
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:36,540
The Hulk is her cousin.

276
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:39,290
- By blood? - Yeah.

277
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:43,950
And she is going to be a megastar.

278
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:47,500
- Her? - Okay, is this really necessary?

279
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,370
I just want you to make me a new suit.

280
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:52,910
Okay, what kind of superhero-ing do you do?

281
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,040
Do you need built-in weaponry? Waterproofing, fire-resistance?

282
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,500
No, I don't need a suit like that. I just need a business suit.

283
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:05,620
Everything I make stands up to the highest combat standards.

284
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:07,290
I don't make basic shit.

285
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:10,330
Yeah, I don't really need any of that. I'm a lawyer.

286
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:15,870
She's a... You're a...

287
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,700
- A lawyer. - She's a lawyer.

288
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,910
That's so cute. I love that. That's so cute.

289
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,250
This one. Thank you.

290
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:25,950
This is a waste of my time and my talents. Please get out.

291
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:27,450
Okay, but she needs a suit

292
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:30,660
that's gonna fit her both as Jen and as She-Hulk.

293
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:33,540
Something that requires a lot of talent. Can we show him?

294
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:41,410
Yeah. All the way down, small, impish.

295
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:44,870
- Large, superhuman.

296
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:48,620
Do you think you could design a suit that would adapt to both of my bodies?

297
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,370
Come on. Ever done a Hulk before?

298
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:54,370
- This is huge. This is huge. - Tinsley!

299
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:59,620
Order extra bolts of the stretch wool. We're going to need

300
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:02,870
a lot of fabric.

301
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:05,660
Why was he so mean? In fashion, it's cool to be mean.

302
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,120
She's so impeccable. Where does she shop?

303
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:11,500
Somewhere with valet parking.

304
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:16,910
Oh, no. Remember that date I went on with the guy with the fetish?

305
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:19,830
- I know her. - She's a client. Of course, you do.

306
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:23,370
He's so creepy and disgusting. Monstrous.

307
00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:28,000
- Hi! Todd, right? - She-Hulk!

308
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,410
Didn't know you worked here.

309
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,160
Yeah! Are you a client, or...

310
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:33,120
I am. I'm one of the biggest.

311
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,620
Just had a meeting with my favorite lady lawyer.

312
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:36,580
No touching.

313
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:38,580
We should, um...

314
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:40,950
Yeah, we should reconnect soon.

315
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:43,910
- Absolutely. That would be great. - Yeah. Drinks on me.

316
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:46,250
Okay.

317
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:53,080
- You rolled over so quickly. - So quickly.

318
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:55,120
- But the drinks are on him. - So quickly.

319
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,200
See you outside in ten.

320
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:00,540
Yeah, and you looked at that guy's dating profile and you were like,

321
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:03,410
"I'll give him a couple of precious hours of my life."

322
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,870
And I sat across... No, She-Hulk.

323
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:10,040
She-Hulk sat across from him for an entire dinner.

324
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:12,790
Yeah, and he for sure is telling all his friends like,

325
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:14,700
"Yo, bro. Went on a date with She-Hulk."

326
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,870
- Oh, my God. - What?

327
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,450
He went on a date with She-Hulk.

328
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:20,200
Yeah.

329
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:23,200
Because I made a dating profile as She-Hulk,

330
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:28,330
and went on several dates as She-Hulk, showing a clear pattern of using the name.

331
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:32,000
Every single one of those dates is a corroborating witness. This...

332
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:35,040
Is how I win this case.

333
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,000
By parading all the questionable men you dated in a courtroom.

334
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:41,000
- Jen, that's going to be embarrassing. - Yeah.

335
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,080
Ms. Book.

336
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:56,660
Your Honor, we have compelling evidence my client did in fact self-identify

337
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,200
with the moniker She-Hulk

338
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,500
well before Titania filed for the trademark.

339
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,580
Please proceed.

340
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,200
My client used "She-Hulk,"

341
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:08,080
not as a name to exploit in order to sell product,

342
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:10,580
but as a genuine part of her identity.

343
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:16,660
As you can see in the "About Me" section, my client wrote, and I quote,

344
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:20,160
"Mean, green and straight-poured into these jeans."

345
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:24,580
And to answer the question, "What are you looking for in a partner?"

346
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:25,830
my client wrote,

347
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:30,580
"A sturdy back and reinforced king-size bed.

348
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:32,910
"JK. JK. JK."

349
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:36,500
We'd like to call our witnesses.

350
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:43,250
'Sup?

351
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:48,370
Yeah, she's like, "It's me. The real She-Hulk. Impressed much?"

352
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:51,750
She came across a little tryhard, to be honest.

353
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,330
I'm just not about that.

354
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:58,580
I specifically remember her referring to herself as She-Hulk,

355
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:02,580
in the third person, and as a writer myself,

356
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:04,000
I found that grating.

357
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,410
Yeah, no, she confided in me

358
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:09,250
that she was initially embarrassed by the name She-Hulk.

359
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:11,200
But then she embraced it.

360
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,540
That's the beautiful part.

361
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:15,450
I guess I'm the kind of guy a woman can really open up to.

362
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:19,660
So you would say you really connected with She-Hulk?

363
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:23,620
She-Hulk and I had an intense connection.

364
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:25,870
We had a great date.

365
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:28,160
She battled demons, I mean, come on.

366
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:32,450
Would you have gone on the date

367
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:36,790
if She-Hulk had instead presented as Jennifer Walters?

368
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:39,870
Look, I don't mean to be rude, but...

369
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:41,790
No.

370
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,620
She's not really my type.

371
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:50,450
But She-Hulk. She-Hulk's incredible. She's amazing.

372
00:20:55,410 --> 00:21:00,250
In light of this new testimony, the court finds in favor of...

373
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,790
Jennifer Walters, aka She-Hulk.

374
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:06,540
Motion for summary judgement is granted.

375
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:10,160
Titania and her subsidiaries will cease usage

376
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:12,660
of the She-Hulk name effective immediately.

377
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:15,750
All current products on the market must be recalled.

378
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:23,950
This isn't over, hater.

379
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,000
- Hey, Titania. - What?

380
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,910
I'm so sorry that happened to you.

381
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,040
- What you getting into later? - Fine. You can buy me things. Let's go.

382
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,290
Hey.

383
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,540
I love you so much, Titania.

384
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:50,750
MAN 2: Titania!

385
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:52,540
Thank you for that.

386
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:57,500
I mean, I might need to schedule several sessions of therapy,

387
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,200
but we won.

388
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:01,950
Look, Walters,

389
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:05,370
what that extremely attractive man said in there,

390
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,540
you can do better. You deserve better.

391
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:17,080
- Can I buy you a drink to say thanks? - Sure.

392
00:22:19,290 --> 00:22:22,500
Here you go. I'm so happy we're doing this.

393
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,450
Cheers.

394
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:25,580
Quite a strategy.

395
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:28,700
I don't know any other lawyer

396
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:31,370
who would humiliate themselves that way to win a case.

397
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:35,290
Yeah, you can always count on me to throw myself under the bus.

398
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:38,500
It's why Holliway pays me the medium bucks.

399
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,200
He couldn't have gone through that.

400
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:43,870
He's never had to prove his value to a parade of underwhelming men.

401
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:44,790
Right?

402
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:48,950
Like, think about everything that She-Hulk brings to the table,

403
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:50,910
and those guys were my best option.

404
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,660
You can have literal superpowers,

405
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:55,620
and some guy with Internet will still think he can do better.

406
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:59,290
Yes! Oh, my God! The things we put up with.

407
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:01,870
I am so happy we're friends now.

408
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:08,370
What... Did I just say that out loud?

409
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:11,790
- Thanks for the drink. - Of course.

410
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:18,500
I thought you were getting better clothes.

411
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:22,950
Oh, yeah, my clothes!

412
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,040
Hey, Luke.

413
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:31,580
Just here to get my suits.

414
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:45,660
Here. Try this.

415
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:46,870
Thank you.

416
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:50,540
Ooh! I like it!

417
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:52,870
Of course you do, because I'm a genius.

418
00:23:57,870 --> 00:24:01,580
I made you a little something extra.

419
00:24:08,410 --> 00:24:11,830
- I don't know that I'll really have an... - Just say thank you, Jennifer.

420
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:12,750
Thank you.

421
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:15,200
Hello, this shouldn't be left out in the open.

422
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:19,580
Tinsley, does client confidentiality mean nothing to you?
