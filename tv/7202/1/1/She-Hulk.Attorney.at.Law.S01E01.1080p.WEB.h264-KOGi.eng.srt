00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:43,833
What is the responsibility
of those with power?

2
00:00:44,708 --> 00:00:49,625
Do they merely have an obligation
to refrain from the misuse of that power?

3
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:52,166
Or do they have a duty
to protect those without it?

4
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:53,750
DENNIS: Two rhetorical questions.

5
00:00:53,833 --> 00:00:55,916
The defendant used
their limitless resources,

6
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,791
political and monetary, for financial gain
at the expense of public safety,

7
00:01:00,875 --> 00:01:03,750
-causing the deaths of innocent people.
-DENNIS: It's so wordy.

8
00:01:03,833 --> 00:01:07,208
They did this because they believed
they would not be held accountable.

9
00:01:07,291 --> 00:01:11,416
That their power shielded them
from very real consequences.

10
00:01:11,916 --> 00:01:15,250
But today, you, the jury,
can prove that's not the case.

11
00:01:15,333 --> 00:01:16,333
DENNIS: More smiles.

12
00:01:16,458 --> 00:01:18,416
Show them that they will
be held accountable,

13
00:01:18,791 --> 00:01:21,000
because those with the most power

14
00:01:21,875 --> 00:01:23,500
have the most to answer for.

15
00:01:23,916 --> 00:01:25,916
And you win the case.

16
00:01:26,291 --> 00:01:28,208
And you are not helpful here at all.

17
00:01:28,291 --> 00:01:30,500
This is gonna land better coming from me.

18
00:01:30,583 --> 00:01:33,666
Plenty of time to switch
things up and let me do the closing.

19
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:36,083
Dennis, you don't know but I will kill you

20
00:01:36,166 --> 00:01:38,708
and Jen won't prosecute.
So I will get away with it.

21
00:01:38,791 --> 00:01:41,583
It's a conflict of interest.
I don't condone murder. Bye, Dennis.

22

over a lawyer?

It's all because I made this little device
which keeps me in human form.

62
00:03:22,291 --> 00:03:26,041
Okay. So, back to what
I was saying before, my theory.

63

-Oh, God.
-Um,

Steve Rogers did not have a girlfriend
before he went into the service.

-Says who?
-The History Channel.

66
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:35,041
So, he becomes Captain America.

67
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:37,333
And from that moment on,
a symbol of America,

68
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:40,416
he is rushed to the frontlines,
he becomes a war hero.

-Then he is frozen in ice.
-Right.

70
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:45,833
JENNIFER: So, based on everything
you've told me,

71
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:49,458
after he gets unfrozen,
he goes from world-threatening disaster

72
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:51,125
to world-threatening disaster.

73
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:53,875
That's when he's not
a fugitive from the law, right?

74
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:57,708
So it seems like
he was pretty, pretty busy.

The first time, it was so intense I could
barely remember what was happening,

320
00:15:27,541 --> 00:15:31,166
but now it's like it settled in.

321
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:32,958
BRUCE: Hmm. Well,

322
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:37,583
I guess we can just skip all that, then.

323
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:41,000
Yeah, kinda seems like I'm done here.

324

when you transform.

00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:49,833
Okay, so how do I turn back into Jen?

327
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:51,250
How did you do it?

328
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:54,833
Usually, I fall out of a jet
or I get knocked out by a robot,

329
00:15:54,916 --> 00:15:56,125
and I'd wake up as Banner.

330
00:15:56,208 --> 00:16:00,250
Or Natasha, for a little while,
would tell me a lullaby.

331
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:02,333
Walk me through how that worked, again.

332
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:04,875
I don't have a great explanation for it.

333
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:08,250
Okay, it seems like the common thread,
though, is being unconscious.

334
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:09,416
Not necessarily.

335
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:12,250
One time, I was stuck
as the other guy for over two years.

336
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:14,791
That was in outer space.

337
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:18,458
-No, I can't stay like this for two years.
-BRUCE: I said "one time."

338
00:16:18,916 --> 00:16:20,250
Whoa.

339
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:23,375
You have so much more
to learn about being a Hulk.

340
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:27,458
I don't think you have thought through
how dangerous this level of power is.

341
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:30,041
Do you know the damage you can cause?

342
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:34,375
(EXHALES) I mean, one mistake,
one freak-out is literally life or death.

343
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:36,125
Okay, I'll be careful.

344
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:38,291
You can't be emotional.

345
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:40,083
Forget Hulk rage.

346
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:44,083
Just regular anger means
death and destruction for everything

347
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:45,250
and everyone around you.

348
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:48,791
And I'm telling you, when people start
seeing you as a monster,

349
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:50,333
that never goes away.

BRUCE: Dialectical behavioral therapy.

354
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:04,375
It allows us to hold two
opposing truths at the same time.

355

First, we're gonna practice some
