1
00:00:01,291 --> 00:00:02,625
我怎么了？
JENNIFER: <i>What happened to me?</i>

2
00:00:08,958 --> 00:00:13,541
BANNER: <i>I'm sorry. I tried to warn you.</i> <i>My blood got into your system.</i>

3
00:00:13,625 --> 00:00:17,416
所以我现在也能变成浩克了
JENNIFER: <i>So I turn into a Hulk now too.</i>

4
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:18,583
(GROWLS)

5
00:00:18,708 --> 00:00:19,875
你是何方神圣？
<i>Who the hell are you?</i>

6
00:00:19,958 --> 00:00:23,000
-女浩克 -沃尔特斯小姐？
-She-Hulk! She-Hulk! She-Hulk! -HOLLIWAY: <i>Ms Walters?</i>

7
00:00:23,083 --> 00:00:26,083
我们刚刚成立了一个 超能人类法务部
We just started a Superhuman Law Division,

8
00:00:26,166 --> 00:00:28,958
我想请女浩克做部门负责人
and I want the She-Hulk to be the face of it.

9
00:00:29,041 --> 00:00:31,583
无论分派给我的是什么案子 我都想尽快接手…
I can't wait to take on whatever case you assign me...

10
00:00:31,666 --> 00:00:36,041
你的第一个案子是 埃米尔·布朗斯基假释案 也就是憎恶
Your first case is the parole of Emil Blonsky. Also known as Abomination.

11
00:00:36,125 --> 00:00:37,333
珍妮佛·沃尔特斯
EMIL: Jennifer Walters.

12
00:00:37,416 --> 00:00:42,125
我已经有个必胜的策略了 百分之百保证胜诉
I've already got a winning strategy, and it is 100% in the bag.

13
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:44,666
也许你应该看看现在的新闻
You might wanna take a look at the news right now.

14
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:47,416
根据一段令人震惊的视频 我们可以看到憎恶
<i>After shocking footage leaked</i> <i>showing the Abomination</i>

15
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,875
参与了一场地下搏击俱乐部的比赛
<i>participating in what appears to be</i> <i>an underground fight club,</i>

16
00:00:50,958 --> 00:00:52,750
不知他是通过何种手段越狱的
<i>after having escaped from prison.</i>

17
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,875
能不能解释一下 为什么之前你没提到
Do you wanna explain to me why you failed to mention

18
00:01:43,958 --> 00:01:47,625
你不但越狱了 还被拍到了这些？
that you not only escaped from prison, but you were also recorded doing so?

19
00:01:47,708 --> 00:01:50,708
你可是当着我的面说 你永远不会变成憎恶了
You said to my face that you never turn into the Abomination anymore.

20
00:01:50,791 --> 00:01:53,458
不 我说的是我选择不变身
No, I said I choose not to.

21
00:01:53,541 --> 00:01:56,875
其实这是情有可原的
You know, these were extenuating circumstances.

22
00:01:56,958 --> 00:01:59,625
你知道这种行为 不但构成了另一项犯罪
You understand that this constitutes another crime

23
00:01:59,708 --> 00:02:01,666
还会彻底毁了你假释的机会吗? 
and totally destroys your chances at parole?

24
00:02:02,583 --> 00:02:03,583
什么？
What?

25
00:02:03,666 --> 00:02:08,083
不会吧 因为我是被迫离开牢房的
Nah, 'cause I was forced to leave my cell,

26
00:02:08,166 --> 00:02:11,708
但是我可是完全自愿回来的
but I returned of my own free will.

27
00:02:11,791 --> 00:02:16,208
是谁强迫你神不知鬼不觉地 逃出戒备这么森严的监狱的?
Who forced you to escape this insanely high-security prison undetected?

28
00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:21,375
一位驾驭秘术的至上尊者 他的名字叫…
A Sorcerer Supreme of the Mystic Arts, and his name is...

29
00:02:21,458 --> 00:02:24,041
王 就叫王
Wong. Just Wong.

30
00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:26,625
而且他在网上也有点神出鬼没
And his Internet presence is a little chaotic.

31
00:02:26,708 --> 00:02:29,916
一会是住在纽约的法师
He's either a sorcerer who lives in New York,

32
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,083
一会是住在尼泊尔的图书管理员
or a librarian who lives in Nepal.

33
00:02:32,166 --> 00:02:33,500
你能联系上他吗？
Can you get to him?

34
00:02:33,583 --> 00:02:35,875
能啊 珍妮佛 你放心 我当然能联系上他
<i>Yes, Jen. It's me.</i> <i>Of course I can get to him.</i>

35
00:02:35,958 --> 00:02:38,750
我想了个妙招 我给他发了张我和一摞书的靓照
I sent a thirst trap. It was a picture of me with a bunch of books.

36
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:40,708
好吧 希望他能回电话
Yeah, well, let's just hope he calls back.

37
00:02:40,791 --> 00:02:42,250
如果布朗斯基说的是实话
If Blonsky's telling the truth,

38
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:46,333
那这家伙就是帮他越狱的人 估计会搞砸整个案子
this guy busted him out of his prison cell and probably ruined my entire case.

39
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:50,375
我知道你们迫不及待想看到王 我能理解
I know you can't wait to see Wong. I get it.

40
00:02:50,458 --> 00:02:52,166
我只是希望你们别以为
I wanna make sure that you don't think

41
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:55,541
这部剧每周都有明星客串 并不是那样的
this is one of those cameo every week type of shows. It's not.

42
00:02:56,541 --> 00:02:57,791
当然 布鲁斯不算
Well, except Bruce.

43
00:02:58,291 --> 00:03:00,583
还有布朗斯基 还有王
And Blonsky. And Wong.

44
00:03:02,208 --> 00:03:04,416
但是别忘了谁才是这部剧的主角
Just remember whose show this actually is.

45
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,750

这则消息引发了巨大的舆论争议
<i>The news has stirred up much controversy.</i>

50
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:23,875
自从珍妮佛·沃尔特斯

51
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:27,666
被爆出拥有一个名为“女浩克”的 超级英雄身份之后
<i>Jennifer Walters has</i> <i>a superhero alter-ego called She-Hulk,</i>

52

<i>全网热议女浩克</i>
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

55
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:46,958
浩克不应该是纯爷们吗？ 怎么女的也能变成浩克了？
<i>They took the Hulk's manhood away,</i> <i>but then they gave it to a woman?</i>

56
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:50,666
我不理解  为什么非得把超级英雄都变成女的？
MAN 2: <i>I don't get it. Why are you turning</i> <i>every superhero into a girl?</i>

57
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:53,625
就因为搞了MeToo运动 男性超级英雄就都消失了？ 
MAN 3: <i>So we have a MeToo movement,</i> <i>and now all the male heroes are gone?</i>

58
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:56,625
我对女性英雄没什么意见 我只是说能不能有点个性
I have no problem with female heroes. Just saying make your own.

59
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:58,458
我不知道你们 但是我也会砸
<i>I don't know about y'all, but I'd smash.</i>

60
00:03:58,541 --> 00:04:01,458
<i>对话杰斐逊·库普</i>
<i>We have Gideon Wilson, the prosecutor</i>

他就是多年前将憎恶送进监狱的检察官 吉迪恩
<i>who put the Abomination away</i> <i>all those years ago. Gideon.</i>

62
00:04:04,416 --> 00:04:07,000
首先我要说的是 我很震惊
<i>First, I would like to say,</i> <i>it is frankly appalling that</i>

63
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:09,833
有人想把憎恶这样的怪物放出来…
<i>anyone would work towards</i> <i>freeing a monster like the...</i>

64
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:14,083
-你看这个胡说八道的节目了吗？  -我才不在乎别人怎么说我
-Have you seen this insanity? -I don't care what anybody says about me.

65
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:16,416
在这个国家里 凡事都得有正当程序
There's something in this country called due process.

66
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,791
-埃米尔有权得到公平的听证 -你得做出回应
-Emil deserves a fair hearing. -You have to respond.

67
00:04:19,291 --> 00:04:21,375
你得把主动权掌握在自己手里
You have to be in control of your own narrative.

68
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:23,791
我是珍妮佛·沃尔特斯

69
00:04:24,833 --> 00:04:26,708
好的 我这就过去
Yes, I will be right there.

霍利韦叫我过去
Holliway beckons.

71

别这样 这可是大案子

人们想了解你生活的每个细节
People wanna know every single detail about your life.

73
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:36,291

You're a public figure now.

74
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:39,333
办公室的电话都被打爆了 全是想采访你的
The office has been flooded with calls and requests for interviews,

75
00:04:39,416 --> 00:04:40,541
所以你应该有个回应
so you should do one.

00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:42,958
大家关注我只是因为 我是埃米尔·布朗斯基的代理律师
People only care because I'm representing Emil Blonsky.

77
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:45,625
案子一结束 这些媒体就会作鸟兽散
Once that's over, this whole media circus will die down.

78
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:49,750
不 珍妮佛 就算你选择视而不见 他们也不会善罢甘休
No, Jen, this is not gonna go away just because you're ignoring it.

79
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:51,541
我在这些破事上浪费一分钟
Every minute I spend on this crap

80
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,958
我的工作时间就少一分钟
is one less minute I spend focusing on my job.

81
00:04:54,416 --> 00:04:58,000
这也太不合理了吧 我真的非常不爽
DENNIS: This is absolutely ridiculous. I am incredibly upset.

82

(JENNIFER CLEARS THROAT)

84
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:05,875
-丹尼斯 -不是吧 珍妮佛·沃尔特斯可不行
-Dennis. -No way... Not Jen Walters.

85
00:05:05,958 --> 00:05:09,833
Ms. Walters is head of the Superhuman Law Division.

86
00:05:09,916 --> 00:05:12,916
We have too much history for me to be comfortable with her on the case.

87
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,916
我倒是想听听是个什么案子 虽然我是不会接的
I would love to know what this is about and not work on it.

88
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:18,416
-您是要找我吗？ -对
-You wanted to see me? -Ah, yes.

这位马洛里·布克 也是超能人类法务部的
Mallory Book is also in the Superhuman Law Division.

90
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:26,250
好吧 也不行 她太完美了 那些尴尬的事我没法启齿
Yeah. No, I can't talk to a 10 about embarrassing man stuff.

91
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:27,958
她没准是我将来的未婚妻呢
She could be my next fiancée.

92
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:30,291
幸好没我的事
Happy to not be involved.

93
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:34,375

Is he a lawyer? He looks cool. I'll take him.

94
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:39,750

95
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:43,916
有个棘手的事需要帮助

他被前女友诈骗
He's been defrauded by an ex-girlfriend

97
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:49,250
想对她提起诉讼 然后把钱追回来
and wants to file a suit against her to get his money back.

98
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:52,291
对 我给她买了珠宝 出钱让她飞去巴厘岛拍写真
Yeah. I bought her jewelry, flew her to Bali for a photo-shoot,

99
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:54,458
还清了她那辆帕萨特的车贷 还给她订了…
paid off her Volkswagen Passat. Subscribed to...

100
00:05:54,541 --> 00:05:56,166
为什么找超能人类法务部？
But why the Superhuman Law Division?

101
00:05:56,250 --> 00:06:00,208
他的女朋友是个会变身的光之精灵 来自新阿斯加德
The girlfriend in question is a shapeshifting Light Elf from New Asgard.

102
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:01,416
真厉害啊 丹尼斯
Wow, Dennis.

103
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:04,333
好吧 其实我还以为和我约会的是 梅根·西·斯塔莉安
Okay. Well, to be fair, I thought I was dating Megan Thee Stallion.

104
00:06:04,416 --> 00:06:05,416
你说什么？
I'm sorry. What?

105
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:08,541
不好意思 你以为你约会的是 梅根·西·斯塔莉安？
Sorry. You thought you were dating Megan Thee Stallion?

106
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:12,416
多项格莱美奖得主 超级巨星梅根·西·斯塔莉安？
Multiple Grammy award-winner megastar Megan Thee Stallion?

107
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,583
你是听不明白什么叫“变身”吗？ 
What part of "shapeshifter" did you not get?

108
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:15,833
(CHUCKLES)

109
00:06:15,916 --> 00:06:19,125
-你觉得她可能开帕萨特吗？ -这就是我不想找沃尔特斯的原因
-You thought she drove a Passat? -This is why I don't want Walters.

110
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:20,833
(CHUCKLES) I'm so sorry.

111
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:22,833
(WHOOSHING)

112
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:26,458
沃尔特斯小姐 我收到你的消息了
Ms. Walters, I received your message.

113
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:29,916
Uh, Mr. Wong. Great entrance. Perfect timing.

114
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,500
-我得去办正事了 -忙你的去吧
-I really need to take this. -You may go.

115
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:35,625
谢谢 巴戈 祝你好运
Thank you. Uh, Pug, good luck.

116
00:06:35,708 --> 00:06:36,791
丹尼斯…
Dennis...

117
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:38,750
(LAUGHS)

118
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:39,958
不好意思
Sorry.

119
00:06:40,458 --> 00:06:42,666
布朗斯基说的都是事实
Everything Mr. Blonsky told you is factual.

120
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:46,041
是我把他从监狱里弄出去的 并非他自己有意而为之
I extracted him from the prison against his own wishes,

121
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:48,083
因为在成为至上尊者的训练中
because I required a worthy opponent

122
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:50,583
我需要一个旗鼓相当的对手
as part of my training to become Sorcerer Supreme.

123
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:54,458
而作为至上尊者 我希望 不要因为我的举动而给他带来惩罚
And as Sorcerer Supreme, I insist that he not be punished for my actions.

124
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:57,875
再说一遍 不是我要惩罚他
Again, I am not the one who will be punishing him.

125
00:06:57,958 --> 00:07:00,708
The parole board will not release him after seeing this video.

126
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:04,916
我知道你在想什么 沃尔特斯小姐 我再也不会消除大家的记忆了
I know what you're thinking, Ms. Walters, and I'm not erasing everyone's memories.

127
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
绝不再干了
Not again.

128
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:08,291
我可没这么想 这非常违背职业道德
That is not what I was thinking. That is highly unethical.

129
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:10,708
对 而且会非常混乱 相信我
Yeah, it's also very messy, believe me.

130
00:07:10,791 --> 00:07:13,166
-好吧 -把他们送去镜像次元空间吧
-Okay. -We'll send him to the Mirror Dimension.

131
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:15,375
-虽然我不懂那是什么 但是不行 -那暗影次元空间呢？
-Don't know what that is, but no. -Shadow Dimension?

132
00:07:16,541 --> 00:07:20,000
你可以做的是出席听证会 把一切解释清楚
What you can do to help is show up at the hearing and explain everything.

133
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:23,541
好吧 那秘术就留作备用方案
Very well. We'll reserve sorcery for strategy B.

134
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:24,750
没什么可保密的
Don't tap your nose.

135
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:29,541
那么布科夫斯基先生 现金加礼物
PUG: So, Mr. Bukowski, how much money in cash and gifts

136
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:32,541
你一共为冒牌的梅根·西·斯塔莉安 花了多少钱？

How about I just say a number, and you tell me higher or lower, okay?

139
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:44,125
参考你给她买的中型轿车 大概5万？
Considering that you bought her a mid-sized sedan, how about $50,000?

140
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:46,750
10万？
100?

141
00:07:47,291 --> 00:07:52,208

142
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:57,333
-没有 差不多17万5吧 -17万5000美金？
-No, it was more like 175. -100... $175,000?

其实你知道吗？ 在内心深处我很清楚
The truth is, I think somewhere deep inside, I knew. You know?

156
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:43,291
我送她那些东西是因为我愿意
I gave those things 'cause I wanted to.

157
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:47,458
我只是因为闹得人尽皆知 所以觉得有点丢脸
I was just embarrassed to get found out in such a public way.

158
00:08:48,083 --> 00:08:50,833
But at some point in time, you gotta take personal responsibility.

-I have to say, this is unexpected. -Well, it's just money after all.

复仇者联盟拒绝你加入是真的吗？

我们今日将在此决定 埃米尔·布朗斯基

185
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:29,541
在服完最低刑期之后 是否有资格回归社会
suitable for return to society after having served his minimum sentence.

186
00:10:29,916 --> 00:10:32,458
最近有证据表明他存在越狱行为
In light of recent evidence of a prison escape,

187
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:35,458
相信各位都有自己的判断 所以我们尽量速战速决
I think we all know how this is gonna go. So, let's keep this brief.

188

作为布朗斯基先生的代理律师 我想就越狱行为作如下澄清
As Mr. Blonsky's counsel, I would love to address the alleged prison escape.

189
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:41,416
我们有一位证人
We do have a witness

190
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:45,041
能够洗清布朗斯基先生 所有不当行为的罪名
who is able to clear Mr. Blonsky of any wrongdoing on his part.

191
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:46,666
那就从他开始吧
Then we'll start with that then.

192

好吧 对 这位证人已经准备好
Well, yes, the witness is prepared to give a statement

在布朗斯基先生陈述后发言
after Mr. Blonsky gives his.

194
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:57,583
此人越狱证据确凿
MAN: Are we really entertaining the idea of releasing

195
00:10:57,666 --> 00:11:00,166
我们真的有必要考虑假释他吗？
someone who's been documented escaping from prison?

196
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:04,708
稍等 布朗斯基先生 你认为自己已经改过自新了吗？
Now hold on. Mr. Blonsky, do you feel you have been rehabilitated?

197
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:06,125
Uh...

198
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:14,375
首先我要说 我现在无比懊悔
Let's start by saying that I feel great remorse,

199
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:17,875
对那些我伤害过的人感到无比羞愧
great shame to those that I've harmed.

200
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:21,958
接下来回答您的问题 是的 我认为我已经改过自新了
So, to answer your question, yes, I feel I have been rehabilitated.

201
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:28,166
被监禁的每一天 我无时无刻不在想着怎么能赎罪
I've spent every day of my incarceration focused solely on redemption.

202
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:30,166
我已经洗心革面了
I have changed.

203
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:34,125
无论是情感层面 身体层面 玄学层面 精神层面
Emotionally, physically, metaphysically, spiritually,

204
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:36,916
还是因果层面 宇宙层面 跨时空层面…
karmically, cosmically, inter-dimensionally...

205
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,333
各种层面
Et cetera.

206
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:42,208
布朗斯基先生想要表达的是 各位面前的这个人
What Mr. Blonsky is trying to say is that the man you see before you

207
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:44,958
已经不是过去的埃米尔·布朗斯基了
is not the same Emil Blonsky as before.

208
00:11:45,041 --> 00:11:48,166
现在他唯一的愿望 就是能够对社会有所贡献
All he wants now is to be a contributing member of society.

209
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:51,166
如果得到假释 你有住的地方吗？
If released, would you have a place to live?

210
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:53,375
有 我可以保证
Yeah. You can rely on that.

211
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:58,958
布朗斯基先生确实拥有一块土地 他打算在那里工作和生活
Mr. Blonsky does own a plot of land on which he plans to work and reside.

212
00:11:59,666 --> 00:12:01,083
他是要去种地吗？
He's going into farming?

213
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:05,791
不 实际上他计划在那里 开设一个冥想训练营
No. Actually, he plans to open a meditation retreat on the property.

214
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:08,291
这就非常…你懂的…
So, just very... Well, you know...

215
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:13,000
那布朗斯基先生 做这件事的资金来源呢？
And how does Mr. Blonsky intend to fund this endeavor?

216
00:12:14,416 --> 00:12:16,500
布朗斯基先生现在
Mr. Blonsky is currently

217
00:12:16,583 --> 00:12:20,250
和七位笔友建立了长期深厚的感情
in a long-term committed relationship with several pen pals.

218
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:23,708
她们每一位都承诺 给予他资金上的支持
All of whom have pledged to financially support him.

219
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:25,375
打断一下 我觉得…
Excuse me. If I could...

220
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:27,833
-我可以说明一下吗？ -不用
-May I clarify? Yeah. -No.

225
00:12:46,791 --> 00:12:50,083
我认为这部分不需要继续展开了 还有其它问题吗？
I don't think we need to get into that any further. Any other questions?

226
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:55,000
布朗斯基开办了监狱识字项目
Blonsky started the prison's literacy program.

227

无数犯人在他的帮助下学会了阅读

-他把我从失败的婚姻中拯救了出来 -没事的 卡尔 哭出来吧
-(SOBS) He saved me from a bad marriage. -That's it, Carl. Let it flow.

230
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:08,791
图书馆现在已经不是 僻静的杀人场所了
Now the library is more than just a quiet place to shiv someone.

231
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:12,875
犯人们不做马桶红酒了 都改做马桶康普茶了
Instead of toilet wine, prisoners make toilet kombucha.

236
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:27,625
就这些？布朗斯基先生的越狱行为 还没有解释呢
Is that all? Because there's still the matter of Mr. Blonsky's escape.

237

(ABOMINATION ROARS ON VIDEO)

238

239
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:41,375
这个行为是情有可原的 那个证人会出面解释
Yes, there were extenuating circumstances that the witness will explain.

240

-总算来了 -我没看时间
-Ah! Finally. -I lost track of time.

243
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,166
我今天请王来作证
I've asked Wong here today

244
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:59,125
因为他应该为 埃米尔·布朗斯基的越狱行为负责
because he is the man responsible for Emil Blonsky leaving prison.

并且我坚信 各位在听完他的陈述之后
And I do think you will see this whole thing in a totally different light

246
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:04,208
会对本案有完全不同的看法
after hearing from him.

247
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:10,333
你们听说过“组手”吗？
Have you ever heard of a kumite?

248
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:11,583
Mmm-mmm.

我恳请驳回 对我方委托人的全部指控
I'd like to move for dismissal of all charges against my client.

250
00:14:15,916 --> 00:14:17,000
On what grounds?

251
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:21,125
鲁纳女士是阿斯加德 现在叫新阿斯加德外交官的女儿
Runa is the daughter of an Elfin diplomat on Asgard and now in New Asgard.

252
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:23,958
-这事你知道吗？ -因此她享有外交豁免权
-Did you know about this? -As such, she has diplomatic immunity.

253
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:28,458
她在新阿斯加德也许有外交豁免权 但是这里不是新阿斯加德
She may have diplomatic immunity in New Asgard, but we are not in New Asgard.

254
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:30,208
不好意思 法官大人
Excuse me, Your Honor,

255
00:14:30,291 --> 00:14:35,041
但是阿斯加德不是一个地方 而是一个民族 所以…
but Asgard is not a place, it is a people. Therefore, I...

256
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:38,333
雷神索尔的即兴演讲 是不能被法庭所采纳的
Thor's inspirational speeches are not admissible in court.

257
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:41,041
法官大人 案情非常清晰明了
Your Honor, this case is very cut and dry.

258
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:45,750
我的委托人被一个诈骗专家 骗走了17万5000美金
My client was defrauded of $175,000 by a scam artist.

259
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:47,458
他所遭受的
He deserves compensation

260
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:49,958
经济损失和情感创伤 理应得到赔偿
for the financial and emotional trauma that he's suffered.

261
00:14:50,041 --> 00:14:53,125
我的委托人与布科夫斯基先生的交往 是基于你情我愿的
My client and Mr. Bukowski were in a consensual relationship

262
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:55,375
-而且涉及角色扮演 -真恶心
-and engaged in role-play. -Oh, gross.

263
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:58,208
没有哪个理性的成年人会相信 我的委托人发来的信息
No rational adult would have believed my client's texts

264
00:14:58,291 --> 00:15:00,333
来自梅根·西·斯塔莉安本人
-were from the real Megan Thee Stallion. -(SCOFFS)

265
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:02,583
布科夫斯基先生 在完全知情的情况下
Mr. Bukowski knew he was dating Miss Runa

266
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:04,958
与鲁纳小姐约会交往 而现在他想结束这段关系
and went along with it until it no longer suited him.

267
00:15:05,041 --> 00:15:06,041
我不知情
I did not.

268
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:08,958
这只是一段破裂的感情 并非一场骗局
This was a relationship gone bad, not a scam.

269
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:11,500
布科夫斯基先生被爱情蒙蔽了双眼
Mr. Bukowski was blinded by love.

270
00:15:11,583 --> 00:15:15,541
他绝对相信和他约会的是 真正的梅根·西·斯塔莉安
He absolutely believed that he was dating the real Megan Thee Stallion.

271
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:20,458
我必须得说 我很难相信 布科夫斯基先生会如此轻易受骗
I must say, I find it hard to believe that Mr. Bukowski could be fooled so easily.

272
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:23,250
而你对此有举证责任 普格利泽先生
And the onus is on you to prove that, Mr. Pugliese.

273
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:25,958
也就是说 我同意本案开庭审理
That being said, I'll allow this to go to trial.

274
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:29,291
所以 鲁纳小姐 你申请驳回诉讼的请求不予批准
So, Miss Runa, your motion to dismiss is denied.

275
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:31,416
-(GAVEL BANGS) -(AUDIENCE MURMURING)

276
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:33,583
搞定
Crushed that.

277
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:38,333
等这个案子结了 我就取消订阅那个“勾搭好莱坞”
And when this is over, I'm canceling my Hollywood Hookups subscription.

278
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:40,041
他们显然没有审查机制
There's clearly no vetting process.

279
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:44,125
(GAVEL TAPPING)

280
00:15:44,791 --> 00:15:49,083
考虑到刚刚收到的最新信息 我要更改判决
In light of some new information I have just received, I'm changing my ruling.

281
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:50,958
(CHUCKLES)

282
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:53,375
Come on, Runa. This is getting a little broad.

283
00:15:54,583 --> 00:15:57,916
冒充法官可是违法的 赶紧给我下来
Impersonating a judge is illegal. Get down from there.

(RUNA LAUGHS WICKEDLY)

285
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:02,625
这对我们非常有利
This is very good for us.

286
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:07,250
Yuck.

287
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:11,083
布朗斯基先生离开监狱 完全是我强迫他的
In regard to Mr. Blonsky vacating his cell, I gave him no choice.

288
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:14,791
但是回到监狱来 绝对是他自己的选择
But it was absolutely his choice to return.

289
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:20,541
我让他留在卡玛泰姬 现在正是一年中最好的季节
I offered him asylum at the Kamar-Taj, which is lovely this time of the year.

290
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:23,416
但是他断然拒绝 坚持要回监狱
But he was quite adamant he be returned

291
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:27,416
他坚持继续服刑 并以此偿还他对社会欠下的债
to serve out his sentence and repay his debt to society.

292
00:16:28,291 --> 00:16:29,291
谢谢你
Thank you.

293
00:16:32,416 --> 00:16:37,708
如您所见 埃米尔·布朗斯基 是被迫离开监狱的 并非出于自愿
So you see, Emil Blonsky was forced out of his cell against his will.

294
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:42,291
而当他可以立刻重获自由时 却主动选择回到监狱里
And even when offered instant freedom, he chose to return to his cell.

295
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:44,583
一个罪犯不会做出这样的举动
These are not the actions of a criminal

296
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:48,291
只有洗心革面 真心改过的人才会如此
but of a reformed man who truly wants to do the right thing.

297
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:50,916
好吧 就算埃米尔·布朗斯基没做错
Well, that may be true of Emil Blonsky,

298
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,875
但是如果他失控变身成憎恶
but when Blonsky uncontrollably becomes Abomination,

299
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:56,250
他不就是一头嗜血的狂暴怪物吗？
isn't he a raging monster out for blood?

00:16:56,791 --> 00:17:00,625

-No. No, no. -What?

埃米尔 不要这样
Emil. Emil, no.

Ladies and gentlemen, I beg you to forgive Mr. Blonsky's enthusiasm.

322
00:18:01,708 --> 00:18:05,333
他并不是想要吓到大家
He didn't intend to frighten anyone.

323
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:10,583
实际上 这恰好证明了 无论何时何地
In fact, this proves that in every instance,

324
00:18:10,666 --> 00:18:17,000
布朗斯基先生本来都能摆脱监禁 但是却选择留在牢房里
Mr. Blonsky could have broken free but has chosen to remain in his cell.

325
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:23,083
而且他出色的服刑记录表明 在全部监禁时间里
As his stellar prison record reflects, Mr. Blonsky spent his entire incarceration

326
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:27,458
布朗斯基先生严格训练 高度自律
practicing a strict regimen of training and self-discipline

327
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:30,500
这样在他重新回到社会的时候
so that he may walk among his fellow citizens

328
00:18:30,583 --> 00:18:35,583
就不会再变成那个暴虐的憎恶了
with no chance of becoming a rampaging Abomination again.

329
00:18:35,666 --> 00:18:39,708
他应该得到自由的权利 成为普通公民 为社会作出贡献
He deserves a future as a free man and a productive citizen.

如果布朗斯基再搞破坏 你准备怎么对付他？
How do you plan to take Blonsky down when he rampages again?

342

What about claims that you're one of Blonsky's rumored soulmates?

-Yeah. No, you're gonna need that. -Connecting the A and B story. Nice.

361
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:26,541
你们俩怎么能和他共事那么久的？
How did you two work with him for so long?

362
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:29,583
我在脑海里早就用各种方式 杀了他好多次了
Oh, I killed him in my head several times, in many different ways.

363
00:20:29,666 --> 00:20:32,041
但是他却一直认为 妮基对他有意思
And yet he was convinced that she had a crush on him.

364
00:20:32,125 --> 00:20:35,333
-这家伙的妄想症已经无药可治了 -我觉得他就是恶心
-The man is almost terminally deluded. -I'd call him gross.

对 就是恶心
JENNIFER: Yeah. Just gross.

is the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.

Hey, P-Dog, how is Jen our best option? I gave you a whole list of my boys.

370

珍妮佛能帮我们拿下这案子 相信我
Jen is gonna help us clinch this. Trust me.

371
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:56,416
沃尔特斯小姐 你如何描述 你和布科夫斯基先生的关系？
Ms. Walters, how would you describe your relationship to Mr. Bukowski?

372
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:59,541
我们在地方检察院共事过几年时间
We worked together for several years at the DA's office.

373
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:02,375
也就是说你非常了解 布科夫斯基先生吗？
Would you say that you know Mr. Bukowski fairly well?

374
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:05,916
当然 我们经常会一起处理案子
Definitely. We worked regularly on cases together,

375
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,916
所以我确实与布科夫斯基先生 相处过很长时间
so I've spent a lot of time with Mr. Bukowski.

376
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:13,916
他会和你谈及他的个人生活吗？ 特别是感情生活
Did he ever share his personal life with you? Specifically, his dating life.

377
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,916
是的 他会提到 而且是经常主动提到
Yes, he would, prolifically and unprompted.

378
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,208
那是因为你八卦
You wanted to know.

379
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:23,708
你会如何描述布科夫斯基先生 在感情生活中的状态呢？
How would you characterize Mr. Bukowski in relation to his romantic life?

380
00:21:25,208 --> 00:21:28,791
自我陶醉 盲目自信 自命不凡
Self-absorbed, chauvinistic, conceited.

381
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:33,583
他曾经说到 自己在纽约是满分 在洛杉矶则是爆表
He once described himself as a New York 10 and an LA 11.

382
00:21:33,666 --> 00:21:35,041
(LAUGHS)

383
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:38,208
他把自己的办公室命名为丹尼斯星球…
He nicknamed his office the Dennisphere...

384
00:21:38,291 --> 00:21:40,166
反对 这与本案无关
Objection. Relevance.

385
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:44,666
布科夫斯基先生 你知道自己不是代理律师吗？
Mr. Bukowski, need I remind you that you're not representing yourself here?

386
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:46,750
而且这是你方证人
And this is your witness.

387
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:50,375
但是我认可你的观点 普格利泽先生 请回到正题
But I agree. Mr. Pugliese, get to your point.

388
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:52,958
在这个法庭上我已多次提到
It's been stated many times in this courtroom

389
00:21:53,041 --> 00:21:55,041
一个具有正常理智的人
that a man of reasonable intelligence

390
00:21:55,125 --> 00:21:58,291
不可能认为自己交往的对象 是梅根·西·斯塔莉安本人的
would never think that he was dating the real Megan Thee Stallion.

391
00:21:58,708 --> 00:22:03,250
在你看来 沃尔特斯小姐 你认为丹尼斯·布科夫斯基
In your opinion, Ms. Walters, do you think that Dennis Bukowski would believe

392
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:07,125
会认为他的个人魅力 足以折服梅根·西·斯塔莉安吗？
that he could actually pull Megan Thee Stallion?

393
00:22:07,208 --> 00:22:12,333
是的 从病理学角度讲 丹尼斯·布科夫斯基不是个正常人
Yes. Dennis Bukowski is an almost pathologically entitled man.

394
00:22:12,416 --> 00:22:15,708
他绝对会认为他就是在和 梅根·西·斯塔莉安本人约会
He would absolutely believe that he's dating the real Megan Thee Stallion

395
00:22:15,791 --> 00:22:17,875
因为他是一个妄想症患者
because he is truly that delusional.

396
00:22:18,583 --> 00:22:20,208
没有其它问题了 法官大人
No further questions, Your Honor.

397
00:22:27,083 --> 00:22:32,166
关于布科夫斯基诉鲁纳一案 我在此宣判丹尼斯·布科夫斯基
In the case of <i>Bukowski v. Runa,</i> I award full damages to Dennis Bukowski

398
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:36,041
获得全部损失赔偿金 共计17万5000美元
in the amount of $175,000.

399
00:22:36,125 --> 00:22:37,250
除此以外
In addition,

400
00:22:37,333 --> 00:22:43,541
我们对本案的被告冒充法官的行为 判处60天监禁
we also sentence the defendant to 60 days for impersonating a judge.

401
00:22:43,625 --> 00:22:45,291
不
No, no, no, no, no, no.

402
00:22:45,791 --> 00:22:47,791
判得好 梅根·西·斯塔莉安 是独一无二的
That's right. There's only one Megan Thee Stallion.

403
00:22:47,875 --> 00:22:49,208
大家嗨起来
Make some noise.

404
00:22:50,208 --> 00:22:51,208
Ah!

405
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:54,416
你们觉得我有机会 和真的梅根交往吗？
You guys think I have a shot with the real Megan Thee Stallion?

406
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,500
