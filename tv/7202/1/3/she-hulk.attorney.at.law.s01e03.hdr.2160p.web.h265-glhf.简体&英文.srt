1
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:02,660
我怎么了
What happened to me?

2
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:10,330
前情提要

3
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:13,580
我很抱歉 我试图警告你的 我的血液进入你的身体里了
I'm sorry. I tried to warn you. My blood got into your system.

4
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:17,410
所以我现在也能变成浩克了
So I turn into a Hulk now too.

5
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:19,870
你是何方神圣
Who the hell are you?

6
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:23,040
-女浩克 -沃尔特斯小姐
- She-Hulk! She-Hulk! She-Hulk! - Ms Walters?

7
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:26,040
我们刚刚成立了一个 超能人类法务部
We just started a Superhuman Law Division,

8
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:28,950
我想请女浩克做部门负责人
and I want the She-Hulk to be the face of it.

9
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:31,580
无论分派给我的是什么案子 我都想尽快接手...
I can't wait to take on whatever case you assign me...

10
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:36,080
你的第一个案子是 埃米尔·布朗斯基假释案 也就是憎恶
Your first case is the parole of Emil Blonsky. Also known as Abomination.

11
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:37,330
珍妮佛·沃尔特斯
Jennifer Walters.

12
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:42,120
我已经有个必胜的策略了 百分之百保证胜诉
I've already got a winning strategy, and it is 100% in the bag.

13
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,660
也许你应该看看现在的新闻
You might wanna take a look at the news right now.

14
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:47,410
根据一段令人震惊的视频 我们可以看到憎恶
After shocking footage leaked showing the Abomination

15
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,870
参与了一场地下搏击俱乐部的比赛
participating in what appears to be an underground fight club,

16
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:52,790
不知他是通过何种手段越狱的
after having escaped from prison.

17
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,870
能不能解释一下 为什么之前你没提到
Do you wanna explain to me why you failed to mention

18
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:47,620
你不但越狱了 还被拍到了这些
that you not only escaped from prison, but you were also recorded doing so?

19
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:50,700
你可是当着我的面说 你永远不会变成憎恶了
You said to my face that you never turn into the Abomination anymore.

20
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,450
不 我说的是我选择不变身
No, I said I choose not to.

21
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:56,870
其实这是情有可原的
You know, these were extenuating circumstances.

22
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:59,290
你知道这种行为 不但构成了另一项犯罪
You understand that this constitutes another crime

23
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,700
还会彻底毁了你假释的机会吗
and totally destroys your chances at parole?

24
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,080
什么
What?

25
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:08,080
不会吧 因为我是被迫离开牢房的
Nah, 'cause I was forced to leave my cell,

26
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,700
但是我可是完全自愿回来的
but I returned of my own free will.

27
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:16,200
是谁强迫你神不知鬼不觉地 逃出戒备这么森严的监狱的
Who forced you to escape this insanely high-security prison undetected?

28
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:21,370
一位驾驭秘术的至上尊者 他的名字叫...
A Sorcerer Supreme of the Mystic Arts, and his name is...

29
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:24,040
王 就叫王
Wong. Just Wong.

30
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,620
而且他在网上也有点神出鬼没
And his Internet presence is a little chaotic.

31
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:29,750
一会是住在纽约的法师
He's either a sorcerer who lives in New York,

32
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,080
一会是住在尼泊尔的图书管理员
or a librarian who lives in Nepal.

33
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,500
你能联系上他吗
Can you get to him?

34
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,870
能啊 珍妮佛 你放心 我当然能联系上他
Yes, Jen. It's me. Of course I can get to him.

35
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:38,750
我想了个妙招 我给他发了张我和一摞书的靓照
I sent a thirst trap. It was a picture of me with a bunch of books.

36
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,700
好吧 希望他能回电话
Yeah, well, let's just hope he calls back.

37
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,250
如果布朗斯基说的是实话
If Blonsky's telling the truth,

38
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:46,370
那这家伙就是帮他越狱的人 估计会搞砸整个案子
this guy busted him out of his prison cell and probably ruined my entire case.

39
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:50,370
我知道你们迫不及待想看到王 我能理解
I know you can't wait to see Wong. I get it.

40
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:52,160
我只是希望你们别以为
I wanna make sure that you don't think

41
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:55,540
这部剧每周都有明星客串 并不是那样的
this is one of those cameo every week type of shows. It's not.

42
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:57,790
当然 布鲁斯不算
Well, except Bruce.

43
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:00,580
还有布朗斯基 还有王
And Blonsky. And Wong.

44
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,410
但是别忘了谁才是这部剧的主角
Just remember whose show this actually is.

45
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,700
《律师女浩克》

本WEB版外挂字幕由  风吹来的那片云  双语合并

00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:10,750
新闻在线 洛杉矶

48
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:13,620
来自古利库霍律所的律师 珍妮佛·沃尔特斯
Attorney Jennifer Walters of law firm GLK and H

49
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:18,330
被委任为埃米尔·布朗斯基 也就是“憎恶”的代理律师
has been tapped to represent Emil Blonsky, also known as the Abomination,

50
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:20,450
负责他即将到来的假释听证会
in his upcoming parole hearing.

51
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,290
这则消息引发了巨大的舆论争议
The news has stirred up much controversy.

52
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:23,870
自从珍妮佛·沃尔特斯
Ever since it's been revealed that

53
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:27,660
被爆出拥有一个名为“女浩克”的 超级英雄身份之后
Jennifer Walters has a superhero alter-ego called She-Hulk,

54
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:31,620
这位身形健美的绿色律师 持续遭到大众抨击
the statuesque green lawyer has been plagued by public backlash,

55
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:34,250
其中不乏许多质疑其能力的声音
with many questioning her qualifications.

56
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:35,790
全网热议女浩克

57
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:38,870
在过去的一小时里 “巨型绿色女人”这一标签

58
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:40,000
还有“大号绿皮女”等热搜词

59
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,410
已经蹿升为全球热搜

60
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:46,950
浩克不应该是纯爷们吗  怎么女的也能变成浩克了
They took the Hulk's manhood away, but then they gave it to a woman?

61
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:50,700
我不理解 为什么非得把超级英雄都变成女的
MAN 2: I don't get it. Why are you turning every superhero into a girl?

62
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:53,750
就因为搞了MeToo运动 男性超级英雄就都消失了
MAN 3: So we have a MeToo movement, and now all the male heroes are gone?

63
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:56,620
我对女性英雄没什么意见 我只是说能不能有点个性
I have no problem with female heroes. Just saying make your own.

64
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,450
我不知道你们 但是我也会砸
I don't know about y'all, but I'd smash.

65
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:00,040
对话杰斐逊·库普
We have Gideon Wilson, the prosecutor

66
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,750
我们即将连线的是吉迪恩·威尔逊
who put the Abomination away all those years ago. Gideon.

67
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:04,330
他就是多年前将憎恶送进监狱的检察官 吉迪恩

68
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:07,000
首先我要说的是 我很震惊
First, I would like to say, it is frankly appalling that

69
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,040
有人想把憎恶这样的怪物放出来...
anyone would work towards freeing a monster like the...

70
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:14,080
-你看这个胡说八道的节目了吗  -我才不在乎别人怎么说我
- Have you seen this insanity? - I don't care what anybody says about me.

71
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,410
在这个国家里 凡事都得有正当程序
There's something in this country called due process.

72
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,830
-埃米尔有权得到公平的听证 -你得做出回应
- Emil deserves a fair hearing. - You have to respond.

73
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:21,500
你得把主动权掌握在自己手里
You have to be in control of your own narrative.

74
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:23,830
我是珍妮佛·沃尔特斯
Jennifer Walters speaking.

75
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:26,700
好的 我这就过去
Yes, I will be right there.

76
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,500
霍利韦叫我过去
Holliway beckons.

77
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:32,160
别这样 这可是大案子
Come on. This case is huge.

78
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:35,080
人们想了解你生活的每个细节
People wanna know every single detail about your life.

79
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,290
你现在可是公众人物
You're a public figure now.

80
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:39,330
办公室的电话都被打爆了 全是想采访你的
The office has been flooded with calls and requests for interviews,

81
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:40,540
所以你应该有个回应
so you should do one.

82
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,950
大家关注我只是因为 我是埃米尔·布朗斯基的代理律师
People only care because I'm representing Emil Blonsky.

83
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:45,620
案子一结束 这些媒体就会作鸟兽散
Once that's over, this whole media circus will die down.

84
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:49,700
不 珍妮佛 就算你选择视而不见 他们也不会善罢甘休
No, Jen, this is not gonna go away just because you're ignoring it.

85
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:51,500
我在这些破事上浪费一分钟
Every minute I spend on this crap

86
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,950
我的工作时间就少一分钟
is one less minute I spend focusing on my job.

87
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:58,040
这也太不合理了吧 我真的非常不爽
This is absolutely ridiculous. I am incredibly upset.

88
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,200
什么办公室居然连瓶红牛都没有
What kind of office doesn't have any Red Bulls?

89
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,910
-丹尼斯 -不是吧 珍妮佛·沃尔特斯可不行
- Dennis. - No way... Not Jen Walters.

90
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:09,830
沃尔特斯小姐是超能人类法务部的领导
Ms. Walters is head of the Superhuman Law Division.

91
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:13,120
我们俩太多恩怨了 我可没法和她共事
We have too much history for me to be comfortable with her on the case.

92
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,120
我倒是想听听是个什么案子 虽然我是不会接的
I would love to know what this is about and not work on it.

93
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:18,410
-您是要找我吗  -对
- You wanted to see me? - Ah, yes.

94
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:21,950
这位马洛里·布克 也是超能人类法务部的
Mallory Book is also in the Superhuman Law Division.

95
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:26,160
好吧 也不行 她太完美了 那些尴尬的事我没法启齿
Yeah. No, I can't talk to a 10 about embarrassing man stuff.

96
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:28,000
她没准是我将来的未婚妻呢
She could be my next fiancée.

97
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,290
幸好没我的事
Happy to not be involved.

98
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:34,370
他是律师吗  看着还不错 我就选他了
Is he a lawyer? He looks cool. I'll take him.

99
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:39,750
好吧 我们的朋友 地方检察院的布科夫斯基先生
Well, our friend, Mr. Bukowski from the DA's office,

100
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:43,910
有个棘手的事需要帮助
needs help on a delicate matter.

101
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,830
他被前女友诈骗
He's been defrauded by an ex-girlfriend

102
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:49,250
想对她提起诉讼 然后把钱追回来
and wants to file a suit against her to get his money back.

103
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:52,290
对 我给她买了珠宝 出钱让她飞去巴厘岛拍写真
Yeah. I bought her jewelry, flew her to Bali for a photo-shoot,

104
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:54,450
还清了她那辆帕萨特的车贷 还给她订了...
paid off her Volkswagen Passat. Subscribed to...

105
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:56,160
为什么找超能人类法务部
But why the Superhuman Law Division?

106
00:05:56,250 --> 00:06:00,290
他的女朋友是个会变身的光之精灵 来自新阿斯加德
The girlfriend in question is a shapeshifting Light Elf from New Asgard.

107
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:01,200
真厉害啊 丹尼斯
Wow, Dennis.

108
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:04,370
好吧 其实我还以为和我约会的是 梅根·西·斯塔莉安
Okay. Well, to be fair, I thought I was dating Megan Thee Stallion.

109
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:05,410
你说什么
I'm sorry. What?

110
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:08,540
不好意思 你以为你约会的是 梅根·西·斯塔莉安
Sorry. You thought you were dating Megan Thee Stallion?

111
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:12,450
多项格莱美奖得主 超级巨星梅根·西·斯塔莉安
Multiple Grammy award-winner megastar Megan Thee Stallion?

112
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:14,700
你是听不明白什么叫“变身”吗
What part of "shapeshifter" did you not get?

113
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:19,080
-你觉得她可能开帕萨特吗  -这就是我不想找沃尔特斯的原因
- You thought she drove a Passat? - This is why I don't want Walters.

114
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,250
真不好意思
I'm so sorry.

115
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,500
沃尔特斯小姐 我收到你的消息了
Ms. Walters, I received your message.

116
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,910
这位是王先生 出场很酷 来得正是时候
Uh, Mr. Wong. Great entrance. Perfect timing.

117
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,330
-我得去办正事了 -忙你的去吧
- I really need to take this. - You may go.

118
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:35,620
谢谢 巴戈 祝你好运
Thank you. Uh, Pug, good luck.

119
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:36,790
丹尼斯...
Dennis...

120
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:40,000
不好意思
Sorry.

121
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:42,660
布朗斯基说的都是事实
Everything Mr. Blonsky told you is factual.

122
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:46,040
是我把他从监狱里弄出去的 并非他自己有意而为之
I extracted him from the prison against his own wishes,

123
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,080
因为在成为至上尊者的训练中
because I required a worthy opponent

124
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,660
我需要一个旗鼓相当的对手
as part of my training to become Sorcerer Supreme.

125
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:54,450
而作为至上尊者 我希望 不要因为我的举动而给他带来惩罚
And as Sorcerer Supreme, I insist that he not be punished for my actions.

126
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,790
再说一遍 不是我要惩罚他
Again, I am not the one who will be punishing him.

127
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,540
看过视频后 假释委员会不可能把他放出去
The parole board will not release him after seeing this video.

128
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:05,160
我知道你在想什么 沃尔特斯小姐 我再也不会消除大家的记忆了
I know what you're thinking, Ms. Walters, and I'm not erasing everyone's memories.

129
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:06,080
绝不再干了
Not again.

130
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,290
我可没这么想 这非常违背职业道德
That is not what I was thinking. That is highly unethical.

131
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:10,700
对 而且会非常混乱 相信我
Yeah, it's also very messy, believe me.

132
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:13,080
-好吧 -把他们送去镜像次元空间吧
- Okay. - We'll send him to the Mirror Dimension.

133
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,410
-虽然我不懂那是什么 但是不行 -那暗影次元空间呢
- Don't know what that is, but no. - Shadow Dimension?

134
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:19,910
你可以做的是出席听证会 把一切解释清楚
What you can do to help is show up at the hearing and explain everything.

135
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,540
好吧 那秘术就留作备用方案
Very well. We'll reserve sorcery for strategy B.

136
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:24,790
没什么可保密的
Don't tap your nose.

137
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:29,540
那么布科夫斯基先生 现金加礼物
So, Mr. Bukowski, how much money in cash and gifts

138
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:32,080
你一共为冒牌的梅根·西·斯塔莉安 花了多少钱
did you spend on the Megan Thee Stallion imposter?

139
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:33,910
天啊
Oh, man.

140
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:39,500
要不然我说个数字 你告诉我是多了还是少了 可以吗
How about I just say a number, and you tell me higher or lower, okay?

141
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:44,120
参考你给她买的中型轿车 大概5万
Considering that you bought her a mid-sized sedan, how about $50,000?

142
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:46,700
10万
100?

143
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:52,040
- 20万  - 20万 我又不傻
- 200? - $200,000? I am not a fool.

144
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:57,330
-没有 差不多17万5吧 - 17万5000美金
- No, it was more like 175. - 100... $175,000?

145
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,580
在很多地方够买一栋房子了 布科夫斯基先生
That's a house in parts of the country, Mr. Bukowski.

146
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:02,120
没错 是啊
Yeah, right.

147
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:05,540
所以你能帮我吗
So, are you gonna help me or not?

148
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:08,910
我会着手梳理案情 并跟你保持联系 布科夫斯基先生
I'm gonna start building your case, and I will be in touch, Mr. Bukowski.

149
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:11,660
好吧
All right.

150
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:18,790
好吧
Okay.

151
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:22,830
冒牌梅根·西·斯塔莉安 在商场大打出手

152
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,910
我根本就不是梅根·西·斯塔莉安
I'm not really Megan Thee Stallion.

153
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,750
打扰了 哥们 你好啊
What's up, bro? How's it hanging, man?

154
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:34,950
我改主意了 我不起诉了
I got a change of heart. I'm gonna drop the case.

155
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:36,450
等等 怎么回事 你刚刚还...
Wait. What? Just now? You just...

156
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:41,540
其实你知道吗  在内心深处我很清楚
The truth is, I think somewhere deep inside, I knew. You know?

157
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:43,290
我送她那些东西是因为我愿意
I gave those things 'cause I wanted to.

158
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:47,500
我只是因为闹得人尽皆知 所以觉得有点丢脸
I was just embarrassed to get found out in such a public way.

159
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:50,870
不过早晚有一天 你得为自己的行为负责
But at some point in time, you gotta take personal responsibility.

160
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:54,870
-我不得不说 这让我有点意外 -说到底不就是点钱嘛
- I have to say, this is unexpected. - Well, it's just money after all.

161
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:59,830
而我有...我有件事要说
And now, I have a... I got a story to tell.

162
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:05,750
不好意思 稍等...您好
- I'm sorry, Mr... This is Pug.

163
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:09,370
哥们 有人把我的赛博卡车拖走了
Hey, man. I think somebody towed my Cybertruck.

164
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:13,700
他们说这是残障人士车位 我发誓这是赛博卡车专用车位
They're saying it was a handicapped spot. I swear it was a Cybertruck spot.

165
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:16,000
喂 你在听吗
Hello? You there?

166
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:18,660
我开赛博卡车把你吓着了吧
Your jaw's on the floor because I drive a Cybertruck.

167
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:19,580
保安
Security!

168
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:26,410
我就喜欢调戏办公室的女同事们 超级刺激 宝贝
I love harassing women in the workplace. It's my kick, baby.

169
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:30,330
-你不能这样 -给你个警告
- Not cool. - Let that be a warning.

170
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:34,120
我才没有
I don't.

171
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:37,000
你们了解我
You guys know me.

172
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:41,580
我们正在戒备极为森严的监狱外 为您现场直播
We're coming to you live from outside the ultra-high security prison

173
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:46,120
稍后那位名为“憎恶”的犯人 将与假释委员会见面
where the man known as the Abomination will appear before a parole board.

174
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:49,250
其有望获批的假释申请 已经引起公愤...
There is much public furor over the possible release of...

175
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:51,580
等等 那是她吗  女浩克 我们能聊几句吗
Wait. Is that her? She-Hulk, can we get a word?

176
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:54,000
复仇者联盟拒绝你加入是真的吗
Is it true you were rejected by the Avengers?

177
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,620
那就是珍妮佛·沃尔特斯 也就是女浩克
That was Jennifer Walters, also known as She-Hulk,

178
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:59,370
有传闻说 她已经被复仇者联盟拒之门外
rumored to have been rejected by the Avengers.

179
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:10,160
-你准备好了吗  -当然
- Hey. Are you ready for this? - Yeah.

180
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:13,700
她们就是你的笔友
Uh, are those your soulmates?

181
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,290
-对啊 -好的
- Ah, yeah. - Okay.

182
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:17,450
王来了吗
Is Wong about?

183
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:21,330
还没有 我无法理解 一个能随意传送的人居然会迟到
No. I don't understand how a guy with zero commute time is late.

184
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:24,910
我们今日将在此决定 埃米尔·布朗斯基
We are here today to determine whether Emil Blonsky is

185
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:29,540
在服完最低刑期之后 是否有资格回归社会
suitable for return to society after having served his minimum sentence.

186
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:32,450
最近有证据表明他存在越狱行为
In light of recent evidence of a prison escape,

187
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:35,450
相信各位都有自己的判断 所以我们尽量速战速决
I think we all know how this is gonna go. So, let's keep this brief.

188
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:39,870
作为布朗斯基先生的代理律师 我想就越狱行为作如下澄清
As Mr. Blonsky's counsel, I would love to address the alleged prison escape.

189
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:41,410
我们有一位证人
We do have a witness

190
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:45,040
能够洗清布朗斯基先生 所有不当行为的罪名
who is able to clear Mr. Blonsky of any wrongdoing on his part.

191
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,660
那就从他开始吧
Then we'll start with that then.

192
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:51,950
好吧 对 这位证人已经准备好
Well, yes, the witness is prepared to give a statement

193
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:54,450
在布朗斯基先生陈述后发言
after Mr. Blonsky gives his.

194
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,580
此人越狱证据确凿
Are we really entertaining the idea of releasing

195
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:59,870
我们真的有必要考虑假释他吗
someone who's been documented escaping from prison?

196
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:04,750
稍等 布朗斯基先生 你认为自己已经改过自新了吗
Now hold on. Mr. Blonsky, do you feel you have been rehabilitated?

197
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:14,370
首先我要说 我现在无比懊悔
Let's start by saying that I feel great remorse,

198
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:17,540
对那些我伤害过的人感到无比羞愧
great shame to those that I've harmed.

199
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:22,000
接下来回答您的问题 是的 我认为我已经改过自新了
So, to answer your question, yes, I feel I have been rehabilitated.

200
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:28,160
被监禁的每一天 我无时无刻不在想着怎么能赎罪
I've spent every day of my incarceration focused solely on redemption.

201
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:30,160
我已经洗心革面了
I have changed.

202
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:34,120
无论是情感层面 身体层面 玄学层面 精神层面
Emotionally, physically, metaphysically, spiritually,

203
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,910
还是因果层面 宇宙层面 跨时空层面...
karmically, cosmically, inter-dimensionally...

204
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,330
各种层面
Et cetera.

205
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:42,200
布朗斯基先生想要表达的是 各位面前的这个人
What Mr. Blonsky is trying to say is that the man you see before you

206
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,950
已经不是过去的埃米尔·布朗斯基了
is not the same Emil Blonsky as before.

207
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:48,160
现在他唯一的愿望 就是能够对社会有所贡献
All he wants now is to be a contributing member of society.

208
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:51,040
如果得到假释 你有住的地方吗
If released, would you have a place to live?

209
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:53,370
有 我可以保证
Yeah. You can rely on that.

210
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:59,040
布朗斯基先生确实拥有一块土地 他打算在那里工作和生活
Mr. Blonsky does own a plot of land on which he plans to work and reside.

211
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:01,080
他是要去种地吗
He's going into farming?

212
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:05,790
不 实际上他计划在那里 开设一个冥想训练营
No. Actually, he plans to open a meditation retreat on the property.

213
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:08,290
这就非常...你懂的...
So, just very... Well, you know...

214
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:13,000
那布朗斯基先生 做这件事的资金来源呢
And how does Mr. Blonsky intend to fund this endeavor?

215
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:16,500
布朗斯基先生现在
Mr. Blonsky is currently

216
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:20,160
和七位笔友建立了长期深厚的感情
in a long-term committed relationship with several pen pals.

217
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:23,700
她们每一位都承诺 给予他资金上的支持
All of whom have pledged to financially support him.

218
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,410
打断一下 我觉得...
Excuse me. If I could...

219
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,830
-我可以说明一下吗  -不用
- May I clarify? Yeah. - No.

220
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:33,910
布莱尔 露丝 玛塔 西拉 亚历杭德罗 伊冯娜 还有妮科莱特都是我的笔友
Blair, Ruth, Marta, Sheila, Alejandra, Yvonne and Nicolette are my soulmates.

221
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:37,120
我们通过监狱的笔友计划相识
We met through the prison pen pal program.

222
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:40,290
她们让我变得更好
They are my better eighths.

223
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:44,700
我爱你们
Love you.

224
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:50,080
我认为这部分不需要继续展开了 还有其它问题吗
I don't think we need to get into that any further. Any other questions?

225
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:55,000
布朗斯基开办了监狱识字项目
Blonsky started the prison's literacy program.

226
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,330
无数犯人在他的帮助下学会了阅读
He's helped countless prisoners learn how to read.

227
00:12:57,330 --> 00:12:58,290
证人 - 职务

228
00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:00,620
他带领犯人 进行冥想和瑜伽训练
He leads guided meditation and yoga for the prisoners.

229
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:06,040
-他把我从失败的婚姻中拯救了出来 -没事的 卡尔 哭出来吧
- He saved me from a bad marriage. - That's it, Carl. Let it flow.

230
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,790
图书馆现在已经不是 僻静的杀人场所了
Now the library is more than just a quiet place to shiv someone.

231
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:12,870
犯人们不做马桶红酒了 都改做马桶康普茶了
Instead of toilet wine, prisoners make toilet kombucha.

232
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:17,750
-我释怀了 琳达 -我为你骄傲 卡尔
- I release you, Linda. - Proud of you, Carl.

233
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:21,160
-我真的很爱你 -好了 卡尔说完了
- I love you so much. - Yeah, okay, we're done with Carl.

234
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:27,620
就这些 布朗斯基先生的越狱行为 还没有解释呢
Is that all? Because there's still the matter of Mr. Blonsky's escape.

235
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:41,370
这个行为是情有可原的 那个证人会出面解释
Yes, there were extenuating circumstances that the witness will explain.

236
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:44,040
如果他决定现身的话
If he ever decides to show up.

237
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:50,000
我很抱歉 沃尔特斯小姐 还有埃米尔
My apologies, Ms. Walters and Emil.

238
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,910
-总算来了 -我没看时间
- Ah! Finally. - I lost track of time.

239
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,160
我今天请王来作证
I've asked Wong here today

240
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:59,120
因为他应该为 埃米尔·布朗斯基的越狱行为负责
because he is the man responsible for Emil Blonsky leaving prison.

241
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,790
并且我坚信 各位在听完他的陈述之后
And I do think you will see this whole thing in a totally different light

242
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,200
会对本案有完全不同的看法
after hearing from him.

243
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:10,370
你们听说过“组手”吗
Have you ever heard of a kumite?

244
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,950
我恳请驳回 对我方委托人的全部指控
I'd like to move for dismissal of all charges against my client.

245
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:17,000
依据是什么
On what grounds?

246
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,120
鲁纳女士是阿斯加德 现在叫新阿斯加德外交官的女儿
Runa is the daughter of an Elfin diplomat on Asgard and now in New Asgard.

247
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,950
-这事你知道吗  -因此她享有外交豁免权
- Did you know about this? - As such, she has diplomatic immunity.

248
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:28,500
她在新阿斯加德也许有外交豁免权 但是这里不是新阿斯加德
She may have diplomatic immunity in New Asgard, but we are not in New Asgard.

249
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,250
不好意思 法官大人
Excuse me, Your Honor,

250
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:35,040
但是阿斯加德不是一个地方 而是一个民族 所以...
but Asgard is not a place, it is a people. Therefore, I...

251
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,370
雷神索尔的即兴演讲 是不能被法庭所采纳的
Thor's inspirational speeches are not admissible in court.

252
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:41,040
法官大人 案情非常清晰明了
Your Honor, this case is very cut and dry.

253
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:45,540
我的委托人被一个诈骗专家 骗走了17万5000美金
My client was defrauded of $175,000 by a scam artist.

254
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,450
他所遭受的
He deserves compensation

255
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:49,950
经济损失和情感创伤 理应得到赔偿
for the financial and emotional trauma that he's suffered.

256
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:53,120
我的委托人与布科夫斯基先生的交往 是基于你情我愿的
My client and Mr. Bukowski were in a consensual relationship

257
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,200
-而且涉及角色扮演 -真恶心
- and engaged in role-play. - Oh, gross.

258
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:58,200
没有哪个理性的成年人会相信 我的委托人发来的信息
No rational adult would have believed my client's texts

259
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,330
来自梅根·西·斯塔莉安本人
- were from the real Megan Thee Stallion.

260
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:02,580
布科夫斯基先生 在完全知情的情况下
Mr. Bukowski knew he was dating Miss Runa

261
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:05,000
与鲁纳小姐约会交往 而现在他想结束这段关系
and went along with it until it no longer suited him.

262
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:05,910
我不知情
I did not.

263
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,950
这只是一段破裂的感情 并非一场骗局
This was a relationship gone bad, not a scam.

264
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:11,500
布科夫斯基先生被爱情蒙蔽了双眼
Mr. Bukowski was blinded by love.

265
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:15,540
他绝对相信和他约会的是 真正的梅根·西·斯塔莉安
He absolutely believed that he was dating the real Megan Thee Stallion.

266
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:20,500
我必须得说 我很难相信 布科夫斯基先生会如此轻易受骗
I must say, I find it hard to believe that Mr. Bukowski could be fooled so easily.

267
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:23,290
而你对此有举证责任 普格利泽先生
And the onus is on you to prove that, Mr. Pugliese.

268
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:25,950
也就是说 我同意本案开庭审理
That being said, I'll allow this to go to trial.

269
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:29,330
所以 鲁纳小姐 你申请驳回诉讼的请求不予批准
So, Miss Runa, your motion to dismiss is denied.

270
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:33,580
搞定
Crushed that.

271
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:38,330
等这个案子结了 我就取消订阅那个“勾搭好莱坞”
And when this is over, I'm canceling my Hollywood Hookups subscription.

272
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:40,080
他们显然没有审查机制
There's clearly no vetting process.

273
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:49,080
考虑到刚刚收到的最新信息 我要更改判决
In light of some new information I have just received, I'm changing my ruling.

274
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:53,410
得了吧 鲁纳 这可太过分了
Come on, Runa. This is getting a little broad.

275
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:57,950
冒充法官可是违法的 赶紧给我下来
Impersonating a judge is illegal. Get down from there.

276
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:02,620
这对我们非常有利
This is very good for us.

277
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:11,040
布朗斯基先生离开监狱 完全是我强迫他的
Yuck. In regard to Mr. Blonsky vacating his cell, I gave him no choice.

278
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:14,790
但是回到监狱来 绝对是他自己的选择
But it was absolutely his choice to return.

279
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:20,540
我让他留在卡玛泰姬 现在正是一年中最好的季节
I offered him asylum at the Kamar-Taj, which is lovely this time of the year.

280
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,410
但是他断然拒绝 坚持要回监狱
But he was quite adamant he be returned

281
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:27,410
他坚持继续服刑 并以此偿还他对社会欠下的债
to serve out his sentence and repay his debt to society.

282
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:29,330
谢谢你
Thank you.

283
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:37,700
如您所见 埃米尔·布朗斯基 是被迫离开监狱的 并非出于自愿
So you see, Emil Blonsky was forced out of his cell against his will.

284
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:42,290
而当他可以立刻重获自由时 却主动选择回到监狱里
And even when offered instant freedom, he chose to return to his cell.

285
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:44,580
一个罪犯不会做出这样的举动
These are not the actions of a criminal

286
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:48,290
只有洗心革面 真心改过的人才会如此
but of a reformed man who truly wants to do the right thing.

287
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,910
好吧 就算埃米尔·布朗斯基没做错
Well, that may be true of Emil Blonsky,

288
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,870
但是如果他失控变身成憎恶
but when Blonsky uncontrollably becomes Abomination,

289
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:56,250
他不就是一头嗜血的狂暴怪物吗
isn't he a raging monster out for blood?

290
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:00,620
打断一下 我有办法打消您的顾虑...
Uh... Excuse me. If I could just put your minds at ease...

291
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:04,200
-不行 绝对不行 -稍等一下
- Oh, no, absolutely not. - Hang on a sec.

292
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:06,120
-不 -怎么了
- No. No, no. - What?

293
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:08,160
埃米尔 不要这样
Emil. Emil, no.

294
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,750
-别担心 珍妮佛 -不要 求你了
- It's fine, Jen. - No, please.

295
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:14,540
不 你...不能...不
No, no, no, no. You... Don't... No, no, no, no.

296
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:20,700
天啊
Oh, my God.

297
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,370
不
- No, no, no, no.

298
00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:25,120
大家不要害怕
Everybody just relax

299
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:28,370
快跑 把他...
- Get out of there! Get him...

300
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,870
-天啊 -停
- Oh, my God! - Stop, stop, stop, stop.

301
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:34,540
-天啊 -等等 没必要动用武力
- Oh, my God. - Hang on. Force is not necessary.

302
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:37,120
各位看到了 我完全可以控制自己
As you can see, I'm in full control.

303
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:39,410
够了 赶快变回来
That's enough! Change back now!

304
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:43,950
快变回来 他没事的 他完全没问题
Get down! Down. He's fine. It's fine. He's totally fine.

305
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:45,830
-埃米尔 -好吧 冷静一下
- Emil! - All right, all right. Calm down.

306
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:54,250
拜托...
Please...

307
00:17:55,540 --> 00:18:01,620
女士们 先生们 恳请各位原谅布朗斯基先生的热情
Ladies and gentlemen, I beg you to forgive Mr. Blonsky's enthusiasm.

308
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:05,410
他并不是想要吓到大家
He didn't intend to frighten anyone.

309
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:10,580
实际上 这恰好证明了 无论何时何地
In fact, this proves that in every instance,

310
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:17,000
布朗斯基先生本来都能摆脱监禁 但是却选择留在牢房里
Mr. Blonsky could have broken free but has chosen to remain in his cell.

311
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:23,080
而且他出色的服刑记录表明 在全部监禁时间里
As his stellar prison record reflects, Mr. Blonsky spent his entire incarceration

312
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:27,500
布朗斯基先生严格训练 高度自律
practicing a strict regimen of training and self-discipline

313
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:30,500
这样在他重新回到社会的时候
so that he may walk among his fellow citizens

314
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:35,580
就不会再变成那个暴虐的憎恶了
with no chance of becoming a rampaging Abomination again.

315
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:39,700
他应该得到自由的权利 成为普通公民 为社会作出贡献
He deserves a future as a free man and a productive citizen.

316
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,120
谢谢你 沃尔特斯小姐
Thank you, Ms. Walters.

317
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:45,120
今天先休庭 我们会评估所有的情况
We will adjourn for today and consider all of the facts.

318
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,250
得出结论后 再宣布复庭
We will reconvene once a decision has been reached.

319
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:51,120
请给这位先生找件衣服
And please, let's get this man some clothes.

320
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:54,080
-好 -至于这位王先生
- Oh, yeah. - And as for Mr. Wong...

321
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:59,040
叫王就行 至上尊者 秘术法师
Just "Wong." The Sorcerer Supreme. Master of the Mystic Arts.

322
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,950
卡玛泰姬的领袖及前图书管理员
Leader and former librarian of Kamar-Taj.

323
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:03,200
行了 你应该意识到
Yeah. You realize that

324
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:08,080
你刚刚承认了协助罪犯越狱 这构成了犯罪
you've just admitted to facilitating a prisoner escape, which is a crime.

325
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,080
我得撤了
I must depart.

326
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:24,660
她出来了
There she is.

327
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:28,950
如果布朗斯基再搞破坏 你准备怎么对付他
How do you plan to take Blonsky down when he rampages again?

328
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:31,750
有人说你也是布朗斯基的笔友之一 你有何回应
What about claims that you're one of Blonsky's rumored soulmates?

329
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:34,330
还有传言说你获得超能力
Is there any truth to the rumors you got your powers

330
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:36,080
-是因为黑帮谋杀阴差阳错 -什么
- from a Mafia hit gone wrong? - What?

331
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:40,950
珍妮佛·沃尔特斯匆匆而过 她无疑是想避开
That was Jennifer Walters rushing by, undoubtedly hoping to avoid the protesters

332
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:43,080
聚集在监狱大门外的抗议者们
that are gathered just outside the gates here.

333
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:46,500
然后我发现有个示威者在我车上写了
And then I get to my car, and some protester has written on it,

334
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,410
“怪物替怪物辩护”
"Monster defending a monster."

335
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,700
只要接受个小采访 就没有这些烦恼了
This can go away with one little interview.

336
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:54,000
-“早安加州”一直想请你呢 -不用了 谢谢 我肯定不去
- Good Day LA is thirsty for you. - No, thank you. Hard pass.

337
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:56,080
真希望这个案子早点了结
- I cannot wait for this to be over

338
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:59,620
这样我就能继续做个 平凡的无名律师了
so I can go back to being a normal anonymous lawyer.

339
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:03,290
-只不过碰巧能变成浩克 -你在说什么啊
- Who also happens to be a Hulk. - What are you talking about?

340
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:07,410
珍妮佛 现在木已成舟了 你现在可是话题人物
Jen, the genie is out of the bottle, girl. You are a story now.

341
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:10,660
好吧 不 我一点都不想这样
Okay, yeah. No. I don't want this.

342
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:13,540
天啊 你竟然怀了憎恶的宝宝
Oh, my God. You're pregnant with the Abomination's baby,

343
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:15,200
还在炫耀你的小肚子
and you're flaunting a baby-bump.

344
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,870
-这就是孩子他爸  -是啊
- That's who the father is? - Yeah.

345
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:19,700
真要命 丹尼斯·布科夫斯基
Good God. Dennis Bukowski.

346
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:23,620
-不 你需要喝一杯 -两条故事线终于有交集了 不错
- Yeah. No, you're gonna need that. - Connecting the A and B story. Nice.

347
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:26,540
你们俩怎么能和他共事那么久的
How did you two work with him for so long?

348
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:29,580
我在脑海里早就用各种方式 杀了他好多次了
Oh, I killed him in my head several times, in many different ways.

349
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:32,040
但是他却一直认为 妮基对他有意思
And yet he was convinced that she had a crush on him.

350
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:35,330
-这家伙的妄想症已经无药可治了 -我觉得他就是恶心
- The man is almost terminally deluded. - I'd call him gross.

351
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:37,080
对 就是恶心
Yeah. Just gross.

352
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,450
你愿意在宣誓之后再说一遍吗
Hey, would you be willing to say that under oath?

353
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:42,540
本人在此郑重宣誓
I swear the testimony I'm about to give today

354
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:45,040
本人所说完全属实 绝无虚言
is the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.

355
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:49,290
巴戈 为什么珍妮佛是最佳人选  我给了你那么多我的哥们
Hey, P-Dog, how is Jen our best option? I gave you a whole list of my boys.

356
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:52,250
珍妮佛能帮我们拿下这案子 相信我
Jen is gonna help us clinch this. Trust me.

357
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:56,450
沃尔特斯小姐 你如何描述 你和布科夫斯基先生的关系
Ms. Walters, how would you describe your relationship to Mr. Bukowski?

358
00:20:56,450 --> 00:20:59,580
我们在地方检察院共事过几年时间
We worked together for several years at the DA's office.

359
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:02,410
也就是说你非常了解 布科夫斯基先生吗
Would you say that you know Mr. Bukowski fairly well?

360
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:05,910
当然 我们经常会一起处理案子
Definitely. We worked regularly on cases together,

361
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,910
所以我确实与布科夫斯基先生 相处过很长时间
so I've spent a lot of time with Mr. Bukowski.

362
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:13,790
他会和你谈及他的个人生活吗  特别是感情生活
Did he ever share his personal life with you? Specifically, his dating life.

363
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,910
是的 他会提到 而且是经常主动提到
Yes, he would, prolifically and unprompted.

364
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,250
那是因为你八卦
You wanted to know.

365
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:23,620
你会如何描述布科夫斯基先生 在感情生活中的状态呢
How would you characterize Mr. Bukowski in relation to his romantic life?

366
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,790
自我陶醉 盲目自信 自命不凡
Self-absorbed, chauvinistic, conceited.

367
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:33,500
他曾经说到 自己在纽约是满分 在洛杉矶则是爆表
He once described himself as a New York 10 and an LA 11.

368
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:38,200
他把自己的办公室命名为丹尼斯星球...
He nicknamed his office the Dennisphere...

369
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,200
反对 这与本案无关
Objection. Relevance.

370
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:44,660
布科夫斯基先生 你知道自己不是代理律师吗
Mr. Bukowski, need I remind you that you're not representing yourself here?

371
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,750
而且这是你方证人
And this is your witness.

372
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:49,830
但是我认可你的观点 普格利泽先生 请回到正题
But I agree. Mr. Pugliese, get to your point.

373
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:52,950
在这个法庭上我已多次提到
It's been stated many times in this courtroom

374
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:55,040
一个具有正常理智的人
that a man of reasonable intelligence

375
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,330
不可能认为自己交往的对象 是梅根·西·斯塔莉安本人的
would never think that he was dating the real Megan Thee Stallion.

376
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:03,250
在你看来 沃尔特斯小姐 你认为丹尼斯·布科夫斯基
In your opinion, Ms. Walters, do you think that Dennis Bukowski would believe

377
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:07,160
会认为他的个人魅力 足以折服梅根·西·斯塔莉安吗
that he could actually pull Megan Thee Stallion?

378
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:12,330
是的 从病理学角度讲 丹尼斯·布科夫斯基不是个正常人
Yes. Dennis Bukowski is an almost pathologically entitled man.

379
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:15,700
他绝对会认为他就是在和 梅根·西·斯塔莉安本人约会
He would absolutely believe that he's dating the real Megan Thee Stallion

380
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:17,910
因为他是一个妄想症患者
because he is truly that delusional.

381
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:20,250
没有其它问题了 法官大人
No further questions, Your Honor.

382
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:32,160
关于布科夫斯基诉鲁纳一案 我在此宣判丹尼斯·布科夫斯基
In the case of Bukowski v. Runa, I award full damages to Dennis Bukowski

383
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:36,080
获得全部损失赔偿金 共计17万5000美元
in the amount of $175,000.

384
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,250
除此以外
In addition,

385
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:43,370
我们对本案的被告冒充法官的行为 判处60天监禁
we also sentence the defendant to 60 days for impersonating a judge.

386
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:45,330
不
No, no, no, no, no, no.

387
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:47,830
判得好 梅根·西·斯塔莉安 是独一无二的
That's right. There's only one Megan Thee Stallion.

388
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:49,200
大家嗨起来
Make some noise.

389
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:54,580
你们觉得我有机会 和真的梅根交往吗
You guys think I have a shot with the real Megan Thee Stallion?

390
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:55,500
我该回去找她吗
Should I go back?

391
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:58,700
别了 拜托 千万别去 谢谢你刚才的证词 珍妮佛
No. No. Please, don't do that. Thanks for that testimony in there, Jen.

392
00:22:58,700 --> 00:22:59,750
乐意效劳
It was my pleasure.

393
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:02,450
令人不爽的是 那个精灵只受了点小惩罚
The sad part is that elf's just gonna get a slap on the wrist.

394
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:04,660
真希望可以移除她的超能力
I wish there was a way we could remove her powers

395
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,910
这样以后就不会再有人受害了
and make sure she doesn't victimize anyone else.

396
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,290
丹尼斯这个主意不错啊
Oh! Did Dennis Bukowski just give me an idea?

397
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:12,950
这件事可要保密
That will stay between us.

398
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:23,790
我们刚刚收到消息 假释委员会已经做出决定了
We've just received word the parole board has reached a decision.

399
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:40,750
经过审查他的记录
After reviewing his record,

400
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:44,330
我们在此批准布朗斯基先生的假释申请 立即生效
we hereby grant Mr. Blonsky's release on parole, effective immediately.

401
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:45,540
太好了
Yes.

402
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:47,790
作为获得假释的条件
- As a condition of his parole,

403
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:51,700
布朗斯基先生将被永远禁止 变身成憎恶
Mr. Blonsky is prohibited from turning into Abomination indefinitely,

404
00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:55,450
并且被要求永远佩戴抑制器
and is ordered to wear an inhibitor in perpetuity.

405
00:23:55,450 --> 00:24:00,040
上述要求如有任何违背 他会立即被再次收监入狱
Any violation of this condition will result in his immediate return to prison.

406
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:02,330
明白 谢谢
Understood. Thank you.

407
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:06,370
谢谢你 珍妮佛 我欠你一个人情
Thank you, Jen. I'm in your debt, you know.

408
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
当然仅限精神层面
Spiritually, of course.

409
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,370
平时低调点 我就这点要求
Just stay out of the news. That's all I ask.

410
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:13,000
我可不想再看到 任何有关你我的故事了
I don't wanna read any more stories about either of us.

411
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,580
这恐怕有点难
You might wanna reconsider that.

412
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:17,700
无论如何他们都会给你编个故事的
They're gonna write a story about you one way or the other, you know.

413
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:19,410
其实还不如你自己来讲
Better to be a part of it, really.

414
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:24,500
市民新闻 晚间报道

415
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:26,830
憎恶现在已经重获自由了
The Abomination is now a free man.

416
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:31,370
今天来到演播室的 是帮助他获得自由的律师 女浩克
Here with us in the studio, the lawyer responsible for his release, She-Hulk.

417
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:34,160
我的名字叫珍妮佛·沃尔特斯 不叫女浩克
Yeah, my name is Jennifer Walters, not She-Hulk,

418
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:38,160
而且我的委托人叫埃米尔·布朗斯基 不叫憎恶
and my client's name is Emil Blonsky, not the Abomination.

419
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:39,870
明白
Got it.

420
00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:44,290
由于这个案件的高关注度 以及你本人是个浩克的缘故
The high-profile nature of this case and the fact that you yourself are a Hulk

421
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:46,660
让你突然成为公众瞩目的焦点
has catapulted you into the public eye.

422
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:49,830
那么给我们讲讲 你是怎么想到女浩克这个名字的
So, tell us, how did you come up with the name She-Hulk?

423
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:52,910
说来有趣 这个名字不是我起的
Oh! Funny story, I didn't.

424
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,700
不知道是谁在新闻里提到的
Some random guy on the news came up with it

425
00:24:55,700 --> 00:25:00,080
可能他自己都没多想 然后就流传开了
after thinking about it for, like, two seconds, but it stuck.

426
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:04,910
现在不管我喜不喜欢 我就永远变成女浩克了
So, now whether I like it or not, I am forever She-Hulk.

427
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,620
好的 我们休息片刻
Great. We have to take a break.

428
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:10,660
随后女浩克将分享 她的饮食和健身小秘密
When we come back, She-Hulk shares her diet and exercise secrets.

429
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:11,660
不好意思 分享什么
I'm sorry. What?

430
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:40,120
抓住她了 快上啊 兄弟们 我抓住她了
- I got her. Come on, guys. I got her.

431
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:42,330
等等
Oh, wait.

432
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:48,290
放开我
Get off me.

433
00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:55,910
如果你要明目张胆地 炫耀自己的超能力
If you're gonna strut around showing off your powers,

434
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,580
你最好有真本事
you better be able to back it up.

435
00:25:57,580 --> 00:26:01,290
我什么时候明目张胆地 炫耀我自己的超能力了
When did I ever strut around and show off my powers?

436
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:09,870
你们是打劫了 阿斯加德的建筑工人吗
Did you guys rob an Asgardian construction worker?

437
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:11,910
是啊
Yeah.

438
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:13,830
好吧 动手吧
All right, let's do this.

439
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:24,830
对不起
Sorry.

440
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,830
好吧 我错了
Okay, bad idea, bad idea.

441
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:36,080
-撤退 -快走
- Fall back! - Go, go, go!

442
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:42,410
好吧 伙计们 我承认和预期的差别有点大
Okay, fellas, I admit that did not go exactly as I imagined it.

443
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:43,870
雷球 你觉得呢
Thunderball, did you get it?

444
00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:48,910
是啊 一旦她变成女浩克 那丑陋的绿皮肤就刀枪不入了
No. Once she turned into She-Hulk, I couldn't pierce that nasty green skin.

445
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,910
该死 老板一定会暴怒的
Damn it. Boss is gonna be mad.

446
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:51,120
《律师女浩克》

447
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:55,450
你好 这不是我最喜欢的委托人嘛
Hi. There's my new favorite client.

448
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:58,330
这里需要你的签名
Just... Just your signature there.

449
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:01,580
这里签首字母就行 好的
And then just initial. Good.

450
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,500
还有上面这里
And initials up here.

451
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:23,200
你可比我上一个律师有意思多了
Oh, you are way more fun than my last lawyer.

452
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,250
-我会为你全力以赴的 梅根·西·斯塔莉安 -放松点
- I will kill for you, Megan Thee Stallion. - Dial it back.

453
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,200
