1
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:21,030
嗨 我是来修理泄漏的
Hi. I'm here about the leak.

2
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:24,450
似乎已经修好了 谢谢
It all seems quite clear. Thanks.

3
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:28,290
可以的话 我想检查一下
I'd like to check, if that's okay.

4
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,460
我能看看你的证件吗
Could I see some ID?

5
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:33,050
当然
Sure.

6
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:50,310
你为什么回到这里来
Why did you come back here?

7
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:52,690
我落下东西了
I forgot something.

8
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,480
法国有什么东西
What was in France?

9
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,240
有法国人 长棍面包
You know, French people, baguettes.

10
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:00,410
你真觉得现在是开玩笑的好时机
Do you really think this is the right moment for cheeky banter?

11
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,700
我得跟我爷爷谈谈
I need to speak with my grandfather

12
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,330
在你向我们了解情况之前 好吗
before you debrief us, okay?

13
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:06,540
你还得答应要保护他
And you need to promise to protect him.

14
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,750
如果你能做到 我就回答你所有的问题 行吗
If you do that, I'll answer everything you have, okay?

15
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:10,880
我们为什么不保护他 他做了什么
Why wouldn't we protect him? What's he done?

16
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:14,130
- 你能保证吗  - 他在哪
- Can you guarantee all that? - Where is he?

17
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:16,010
先答应我
Give me your word.

18
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,840
我们要带你去总部
We're taking you to the Park.

19
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,140
- 你没资格提要求 - 行吧
- You're in no position to make demands. - Okay, fine.

20
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,570
你是谁
Who are you?

21
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:39,070
抱歉 我失礼了 弗兰克哈克尼斯
Sorry, forgetting my manners. Frank Harkness.

22
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:43,990
不过你知道我的另一个名字
Although, you know me by another name.

23
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:46,830
米切菲尔波特
Mitch Philpott.

24
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:50,960
当然了 我不是真正的米切菲尔波特
I'm not the real Mitch Philpott, obviously.

25
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:54,710
对 他几年前死了 你并不知道 莫莉
No, he died a couple of years ago, you didn't know that, Molly.

26
00:02:54,710 --> 00:03:00,130
但我让他复活了 上周还跟你聊了聊
But I brought him back from the dead to have a little chat with you last week,

27
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,430
你很高兴能和当年的熟人聊天
and you were so happy to talk to someone from the old days.

28
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:08,930
有点可悲
It was kind of pathetic.

29
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:12,140
是你想联系大卫卡特怀特和山姆查普曼
You wanted to get in touch with David Cartwright and Sam Chapman,

30
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,520
需要他们的地址
needed their addresses.

31
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,610
是的
Yeah.

32
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:15,980
我们聊了当年的行动
We spoke about old ops.

33
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:22,660
你了解所有的细节 证明你曾是中情局的人
You had all the details, which makes you ex-CIA.

34
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:28,330
怎样
What?

35
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:33,380
如果我一小时内没回总部 他们就会来找
If I'm not back at the Park within an hour, they'll come looking.

36
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:37,340
不会的 没有人会想到你 莫莉
No, they won't. No one will miss you, Molly.

37
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:39,300
所以我才选了你
That's why I picked you.

38
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:45,470
你打造了自己的地牢 把所有人拒之门外
You built your own dungeon and you shut everyone out.

39
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:47,890
你想怎样
What do you want?

40
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:49,560
问得好
Okay, good.

41
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:52,560
疑犯刚刚被带走了
Person of interest has just been picked up.

42
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,060
我需要知道特工要把他带到哪去
I need to know where the Dogs are taking him.

43
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:57,570
应该是去总部 你不需要我来告诉你
Presumably to the Park. You don't need me to tell you that.

44
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,900
确实不需要 莫莉
No, that's true, Molly, I don't.

45
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:05,740
但如果你把指纹和登录密码告诉我
But if you give me your fingerprint and your access codes,

46
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:08,660
我就能大显身手 追踪他们的行程
I can then work my magic and track their journey.

47
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:10,910
也许还能顺道打个招呼
Maybe say "hello," on the way

48
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:13,160
赶在他们被关进情报机关之前
before they get swallowed up by the machine.

49
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:14,960
我更喜欢在线下工作
I'm more of a hard-copy girl.

50
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:18,790
但你还是有总部电脑系统的登录密码
But you still have access codes to the Park's computer systems.

51
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,800
我从来不登录 所以不记得了
I don't use them, so I don't remember them.

52
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,970
拜托 别太谦虚了 莫莉 你什么都记得
Come on, don't do yourself down, Molly. You remember everything.

53
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:28,760
所以你才是档案负责人
That's why you're in charge of the archive.

54
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,730
我的记忆力不比当年了
My powers of recall aren't what they were.

55
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:35,730
好吧
Okay.

56
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:37,770
行
Okay.

57
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:49,910
我随时可以切掉你的手指 对吧
I can always cut off your finger, yeah?

58
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:54,540
用它来刷指纹 再挖出你的一只眼睛 帮你想起密码
Lay it on the keypad and take out an eye to jog your memory.

59
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:58,130
见鬼 如果你冥顽不化
And fuck it, if you're gonna be an asshole about it,

60
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:00,630
我可以锯掉你剩下的这条腿
I can saw through your remaining leg.

61
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,720
让你更平衡一点
Even you up a little.

62
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,560
你意下如何
So, what do you say?

63
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,560
说还是不说
What do you say?

64
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:55,730
(根据米克赫伦的著作《惊魂街》改编)

65
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:01,250
流人
第四季第五集

66
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:01,250
本WEB版外挂字幕由  风吹来的那片云  双语合并

67
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:08,950
你非得这样吗 好吧
Do you have to do that? Right.

68
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:11,740
- 他非得这么干  - 你一直神出鬼没 所以是的
- Does he have to do this? - You've been pretty elusive, so, yes.

69
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:12,830
(亚当洛克希德)

70
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:17,000
这是罗伯特温特斯 还有被你打烂脸的那个人
This is Robert Winters and the guy whose face you blew off.

71
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:19,250
你从哪弄来的
Where did you get this?

72
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:23,750
我说了 在和我爷爷谈之前 我什么都不会说的
I told you, I'm not saying anything until I've spoken to my grandfather.

73
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,510
你不想让他受到牵连
Are you trying not to incriminate him?

74
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:30,550
如果这张照片里的另外两人 在策划第二次韦斯特艾克斯爆炸案呢
What if the two other people in this photo are planning a second Westacres?

75
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:32,430
如果因为你隐瞒任何信息
If there's any information you withhold,

76
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:34,510
让我们无法阻止另一次炸弹袭击
which means we don't stop them setting off another bomb,

77
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:38,690
- 那就怪你 - 我觉得韦斯特艾克斯案不会有后续了
- that's on you. - Westacres was a one-off. I think.

78
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:40,310
真令人安心呢
Well, that's comforting.

79
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:43,440
我要不要根据你的直觉 把威胁级别降低几级
Shall I take the official threat level down a few notches based on this hunch?

80
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,780
听着 这对你来说是好事 不是吗  你可以把我们俩一起逮捕
Look, this is good for you, isn't it? You get to bring us both in.

81
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:49,990
给我五分钟就好 仅此而已
So, just give me five minutes. That's all I want.

82
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:53,580
好 我给你五分钟
Okay. You'll have your five minutes.

83
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,330
谢谢
Thank you.

84
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:56,410
他在哪
Where is he?

85
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:59,290
- 凯瑟琳斯坦迪什家 - 老天
- Catherine Standish's. - Jesus Christ.

86
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:01,750
兰姆已经用过这招了 他不在那里
Lamb already tried that one. He's not there.

87
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:03,790
什么
What?

88
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:07,670
什么
What?

89
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:10,300
我抓到瑞弗卡特怀特了 他在他爷爷家
I've got River Cartwright. He was at his grandfather's.

90
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,680
为什么
Why?

91
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,050
他不肯说
Well, he won't say.

92
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:14,300
那他说了什么
Well, what is he saying?

93
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:17,430
什么都不说 他只想跟他爷爷谈
Nothing. Just wants to talk to his grandfather.

94
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:20,560
谁不想呢 对了 他爷爷那边怎么样了
Who doesn't? How's that going by the way?

95
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,520
有人拉响了火警 我的人进去时 他已经不见了
Someone set off the fire alarm. When my guys got in, he'd gone.

96
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,440
我正在叫人查监控
I've got people combing through CCTV now.

97
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:28,400
瑞弗身上有没有洛克希德的护照
Did River have the Lockhead passport on him?

98
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,490
- 有 - 给我带回来
- Yes. - Bring it to me.

99
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:32,570
先把他关进地下室
Once you've taken him down to the basement.

100
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:34,030
应该先登记
Should be logged first.

101
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:37,580
把护照拿给我就好 我来处理
Just bring it to me. I will take care of it.

102
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:50,590
他在哪
Where is he?

103
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:51,680
闭嘴
Shut up.

104
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:54,010
- 兰姆带走他了  - 闭嘴
- Does Lamb have him? - Shut up.

105
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:56,010
你为什么不告诉她照片的事
And why didn't you tell her about the photograph?

106
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:57,100
闭嘴
Shut up!

107
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:06,270
让我下车
Let me out.

108
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:07,190
(德士)

109
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:10,400
- 没事的 大卫 - 你们必须让我下车
- It's all right, David. - You have to let me out.

110
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,700
你是我的手下 照我说的做
You work for me, you do as I tell you.

111
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,820
你多年前就退休了 蠢货
You retired years ago, you daft sod.

112
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:17,330
而我早在那之前就不是你的手下了
And I quit working for you well before then.

113
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:21,750
好了 你把送去法国的枪和钱给了谁
Now, who'd you send guns and money to in France?

114
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:25,330
滚蛋 兰姆 我不向你和他汇报
Fuck off, Lamb. I don't answer to you or to him.

115
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,340
向谁
To who?

116
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,510
在法国的人
Whoever's in France.

117
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:33,930
- 带我去见局长 - 不
- Take me to First Desk. - No.

118
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:35,510
我们要回斯劳部门吗
Are we going back to Slough House?

119
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:36,510
不是
No!

120
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:40,810
- 你要带我去哪  - 你给我安静坐好了
- Where are you taking me? - Just sit back and shut up!

121
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:54,110
应该搭德士了
Should've got a taxi.

122
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:55,360
急什么
What's the hurry?

123
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,320
是你没钱搭德士吧
Just 'cause you can't afford it.

124
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:00,580
你的枪卖了多少
How much did you get for that gun?

125
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:03,290
搞什么 谢了
What the fuck? Thanks.

126
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:05,000
你卖了一支枪
You sold a gun?

127
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,290
是 我抵押了一支枪 借了点钱
I borrowed some money against a gun, yeah.

128
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:09,710
但我会赎回来的
But I'm getting it back.

129
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:10,840
从舞者布莱恩那里
From Dancer Blaine?

130
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,960
你怎么知道舞者
How do you know Dancer?

131
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:13,920
我当过查枪的卧底
I ran an undercover gun op.

132
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:17,260
你跟她说 他是个好人 不会把枪卖给黑帮
Well, tell her he's a good guy. He doesn't sell to gangs.

133
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:18,850
怎么 只作收藏吗
What, just gentlemen collectors, is it?

134
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:20,930
- 他不会把枪卖给黑帮 - 谢谢
- He doesn't sell to street gangs. - Thank you.

135
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:24,230
但他会卖给犯罪团伙 无证保镖
But he does sell to organized crime, unlicensed bodyguards.

136
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:26,980
精品军火商 厉害啊 高端啊
Boutique arms dealer? Nice. Classy.

137
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:28,810
你吸的毒都是正规渠道取得的
Was all that coke you snorted fair trade?

138
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:31,400
不好意思 你赌博赢的钱交税吗
Sorry, do you pay tax on your gambling winnings?

139
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,320
喂
Hello?

140
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,820
你给我留言 说了我儿子的事
You left a message about my son.

141
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:36,450
嗨...抱歉
Hi-- Sorry.

142
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:39,160
两位 别吵了 是瑞弗的母亲
Guys, shut up! It's River's mother.

143
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,160
- 蠢货 - 抱歉
- Muppet. - Sorry.

144
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,120
你说他出事了
You said something had happened to him.

145
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,830
是 是这样
Yeah. There was--

146
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:48,170
你父亲的家里出了点事
there was an incident at your father's house.

147
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:51,170
有人想伤害他
And someone tried to hurt him.

148
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:55,260
有一具尸体被误认为是瑞弗的
And there was a body which was misidentified as River.

149
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,880
怎么会有人认错呢
How the hell did someone get that wrong?

150
00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:00,180
你可能想知道你父亲怎么样了
You're probably wondering how your father is?

151
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:03,010
并不想
Not really.

152
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:05,390
好吧 他失踪了
Okay, well, he's missing,

153
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:08,190
瑞弗在出外勤 我们跟他失联了
and River is in the field, we've lost contact with him.

154
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:11,810
你父亲有消息的话 要我打给你吗
Would you like me to call you if there's any news about your father?

155
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,150
不了 我们很多年没说话了
No. We haven't spoken in years.

156
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:17,240
看到瑞弗的话 提醒他我还活着呢
When you see River, remind him I exist.

157
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,240
怎么样
Well?

158
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:25,120
这一家子真是个灾难
That family, what a car crash.

159
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:33,500
你找我
You called.

160
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:36,800
你在总部时
When you were over at the Park,

161
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,550
你收到过周边地区的出警日志
you were sent the police duty logs for the surrounding area.

162
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:41,010
(阿金 26岁 香港)

163
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:45,220
确认一下
Acknowledge.

164
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,850
是的 抱歉 对 出警日志
Yes. Sorry. Right. Duty logs.

165
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,690
通常不是很有意思
Well, that's not usually anything very interesting.

166
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:54,190
老酒鬼 扒手 偶尔的抢劫
The odd drunk, pickpockets, occasional mugging.

167
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:56,780
还有在老工业区路边慢慢开车找妓女
And curb-crawling over by the old industrial estate.

168
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:00,070
对 不幸的人啊
Yes. Poor souls.

169
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:04,080
可不是嘛 我可怜那个 还得花钱做爱的男人
I know. I pity the man who has to pay for sex.

170
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,620
我是说妓女不幸
I was referring to the prostitutes.

171
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:13,500
这份报告是在你被调走前几周提交的
This report came in a couple of weeks before you were moved.

172
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,420
你觉得这个名字普通吗
Does that strike you as a regular name?

173
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:23,430
“加拉哈特” 对 我记得当时想 这个行为可没什么骑士风度
"Galahad." Yes, I remember thinking, not very knightly behavior.

174
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:27,720
你觉得这是某人的真名吗
And do you think that's someone's real name?

175
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:30,140
肯定是不常见的名字
Well, it's certainly a very unusual name.

176
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:32,810
这是警方给在总部工作的人起的代号
It's a Met code name for someone who works at the Park.

177
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:34,820
谁
Who?

178
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,860
你需要下一级别的天才来告诉你答案
Well, you need next-level genius for that.

179
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:39,990
好吧
Right.

180
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,820
我去哪找这种天才呢
Well, where am I gonna find such a genius?

181
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:46,870
放轻松 何大爷在此
Relax. Ho's here.

182
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:56,000
天啊 竟然是他
Oh, my God. Him?

183
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:59,670
对 他就是你在这里的原因
Yeah. He is why you're here.

184
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:03,760
因为他喜欢...
Because he likes the ladies...

185
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,050
站街女
of the night.

186
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,810
开会
Meeting.

187
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:09,770
都上楼来
Upstairs now.

188
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:13,060
- 谁让你负责了  - 形势所迫
- Who put you in charge? - Circumstances.

189
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:16,650
没我不行啊
Ain't nothing without me.

190
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:21,360
(伦敦警察厅 政治敏感人物代号)

191
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,450
(5.1 加拉哈特)

192
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,740
(姓名:克劳德惠兰 职务:局长)

193
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:27,700
好 我们...都知道什么
Right, so what do we-- what do we know?

194
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,830
知道该由我来主持会议
That I should be leading the meeting?

195
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:30,910
我们开什么会
What are we doing here?

196
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:32,660
对 我们有特工在出外勤
Right. We've got agents in the field,

197
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:36,790
我们来想办法支持他们吧
so let's work out a way that we can support them.

198
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,090
很有帮助 科
Great help, Coe.

199
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:42,130
戴耳机有助于令他专注
It helps him block things out.

200
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:44,760
科 说真的 你能认真点吗
Coe, seriously, do you think you could try and be in the room?

201
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:49,390
这里没什么可做的 我们谁也帮不了
There's nothing going on in this room. We can't help anyone.

202
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:52,310
这是个吊车尾的部门 没有统一的使命感
This is a D-list unit with no unifying sense of purpose.

203
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:55,810
这里的每一个人都是被开除且自暴自弃的
Everyone here has checked out and been written off.

204
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,520
你只代表自己
Well, speak for yourself.

205
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,980
他知道自己在说什么 他做过心评
He knows what he's talking about. He was in psych eval.

206
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:03,900
就是心理评估
Psychological evaluation.

207
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:06,610
我虽然是下等马 但我知道简称是什么意思
I might be a Slow Horse, but I can decipher abbreviations.

208
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,910
那才是鬼扯的部门呢
And that is a bullshit unit.

209
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,330
你有易怒和无法跟人亲近的问题
You have anger and intimacy issues,

210
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:17,330
不会团队合作 但你又不肯承担责任
you can't work in a team, but nor will you take personal responsibility.

211
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:21,090
你把自我憎恨的情绪 转变为对马库斯赌博的批评
You channel your own self-loathing into criticizing Marcus's gambling.

212
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:25,300
你打心底不开心
You're a deeply unhappy person.

213
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:30,220
总结得很到位
Nutshell.

214
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:31,560
好了 别吵了
Okay, fuck this.

215
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,930
我不会干坐着看更多人死掉 我们来回顾一下已知信息
I am not gonna sit around waiting for more bodies to drop, so let's circle back.

216
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:37,400
关于想杀查普曼的人 我们都知道些什么
What do we know about the man that tried to kill Chapman?

217
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,110
什么 你是说这个冷血传奇人物
What? You mean this stone-cold legend?

218
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:40,820
天啊 何 你认真的
Oh, my God. Ho, seriously?

219
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,320
你觉得你能打得过他
Think you could take him, do you?

220
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,690
他把你揍扁
He'd slice through you

221
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:44,900
就像撒尿滋雪那么简单
like piss through snow.

222
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,700
你有空做表情包来嘲笑马库斯
Instead of making GIFs to tease Marcus,

223
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:50,410
不如在他再次尝试杀死查普曼前 追踪到他的位置
you could try and track him down before he tries to kill Chapman again.

224
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:53,490
他伤得不轻 我们可以查查各个医院
Well, he was pretty injured, so we could check at the hospitals.

225
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,330
他不会去医院的 对吗
Well, he's not gonna go to a hospital, is he?

226
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,250
他不会让任何系统记录到
He won't want to be on any systems.

227
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:59,460
- 他会去找非法医生 - 确实
- He'll be with a backstreet doctor. - Yeah, that's true.

228
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:01,500
他们不会有在线预约系统
And they're not gonna have an online booking system.

229
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:03,750
所以没法查
So, there's no way of checking.

230
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,220
其实有
There is actually.

231
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:08,340
非法医生通常是被正式系统除名的
Backstreet doctors have usually been struck off.

232
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:11,300
我们有个和卧底特工分享的数据库
We have a database which we share with agents going undercover,

233
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:12,390
以防他们需要看医生
in case they need them.

234
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:14,890
天啊 你还真不是一无是处
Fucking hell, you actually do have a use.

235
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:16,980
好 你能登录那个数据库吗
Okay. Do you have access to that database?

236
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:18,850
不能
No.

237
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:20,610
好极了
Great.

238
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:22,690
但我可以打几个电话
But I can make some calls.

239
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:35,580
(局长 克劳德惠兰)

240
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:36,660
进来
Come.

241
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,760
瑞弗卡特怀特正被带过来
River Cartwright is incoming.

242
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:48,510
好 很好 请坐
Good. That's good. Please take a seat.

243
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:53,010
好 是的 很好
Good. Yes. That's good.

244
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,270
原来那本护照旅行了好几次
Turns out that passport's actually made a few journeys.

245
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:58,060
对 往返法国
Yeah, back and forth from France.

246
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,640
我其实指的是在此之前
I meant before that actually.

247
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:01,350
吉提刚收到了国际刑警
Giti's just heard back from Interpol

248
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,730
和几个欧洲情报机构的回复
and the individual European intelligence agencies.

249
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:05,900
她给我看了这个
And she brought me this.

250
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,280
(亚当洛克希德)

251
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,450
看到吗 好
See that there? Right.

252
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:14,240
2014年6月 他在慕尼黑 在此期间发生了一起汽车炸弹袭击事件
So in June, 2014, he was in Munich, same time as a car bomb

253
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,580
该袭击杀死了一位车臣情报部的高官
killed a high-ranking member of the Chechen intelligence service.

254
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:21,330
然后他在巴黎 然后...
Then he was in Paris. And--

255
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,000
信号中断
Signal disconnected.

256
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:27,920
- 真烦人 见鬼 - 信号中断
- That's annoying. Damn. - Signal disconnected.

257
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,010
- 我不知道是怎么回事 - 没关系 我...
- I don't know what's going on here. - It doesn't matter. I--

258
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:32,890
我知道没关系 我...想把这些事...
I know it doesn't matter. I just-- I'd like to get these things--

259
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:34,850
稍等 我有线
Hold on for two seconds 'cause there's a cable,

260
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:38,100
我们可以直接连线 如果我...该...
and we can actually link it up if I get the-- Oh, fu--

261
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,020
我其实完全不知道怎么连
I actually don't know how that links up at all.

262
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:41,730
没事 克劳德 真的没关系
No, Claude, it really doesn't matter.

263
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:43,770
好吧 这样 你可以直接在电脑上看
All right. Well, look, you can actually look at the computer--

264
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:48,110
克劳德 我知道这些城市在哪 我不需要演示稿
Claude, I know where these cities are. I do not need a PowerPoint presentation.

265
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,450
好 当然 明白
Okay. Sure. Got it.

266
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:58,950
2015年2月 他在巴黎
So, he was in Paris in February of 2015,

267
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:01,210
当时有一位巴勒斯坦人权律师中毒
Palestinian human rights lawyer poisoned.

268
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:07,800
然后2017年3月 斯德哥尔摩 也是类似的事
And then, in Stockholm, in March of 2017, blah blah-di blah,

269
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,420
一个阿尔巴尼亚黑帮成员溺亡
a member of the Albanian Mafia drowned.

270
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:15,300
是 我们的一个身份被一个暗杀组织用了
Yeah, so one of our IDs is being used by a death squad.

271
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,100
其实是两个
Two of our IDs actually.

272
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:21,140
罗伯特温特斯也在上述两个地点
Robert Winters was at both of those locations.

273
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:26,360
- 所以...糟糕 - 怎么
- So-- Oh, fuck. - Yes?

274
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:31,570
如你所知 我的职责是 启动问责制和可访问性
As you know, my brief is to activate accountability and accessibility,

275
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:33,610
这是重大的承诺
that's the triple-A promise.

276
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:37,830
但现在 鉴于对当下形势的彻底审核
But now, reviewing the current situation in the round,

277
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:41,580
我的职责变了 让透明度见鬼去吧 管他呢
my position has shifted somewhat to fuck-that-completely. Fuck it.

278
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,080
这整件事得用水泥箱封存
This whole thing needs to be locked in a concrete box

279
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,750
丢进大海中央
and dropped in the middle of the ocean.

280
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:47,880
吉提怎么办
And what about Giti?

281
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,210
她是潜在的吹哨人
Potential whistleblower.

282
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:52,470
她也该被一起封进水泥箱里
She needs to be put in a fucking concrete box and all.

283
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:56,590
这话听起来很糟糕 我不是那个意思
That sounded awful. I didn't mean that--

284
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,930
我当然不希望吉提受到任何伤害
I don't want any harm to come to Giti obviously.

285
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:00,010
是
Yeah.

286
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,770
她签了政府保密法 不是吗
She's signed the Official Secrets Act, hasn't she?

287
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:03,270
所以只要她看重这份工作
So she's gonna keep her mouth shut

288
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:05,650
她就会守口如瓶 而她确实看重
if she values her job, and she bloody well does.

289
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,190
我们得跟她谈谈
We need to talk to her.

290
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,980
好主意 我们该跟她谈
That's a good idea. We should.

291
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:15,070
但我们怎么处理卡特怀特一家
But what are we going to do about the Cartwrights?

292
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:18,450
我们得查明洗手间里是谁扣动了扳机
We need to find out who pulled the trigger in that bathroom.

293
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:20,120
只要让那个人不坐牢
Keeping that person out of jail

294
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:23,040
就能换来这爷孙俩永远不会开口
will buy us everlasting silence from both of them.

295
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:28,500
永远不开口这一点 现在听起来很动听
Everlasting silence sounds really good around now.

296
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,130
- 对 - 是的
- Yeah. - Yeah.

297
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:41,890
(远程登录 允许访问 莫莉多兰)

298
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:44,640
谢谢你 莫莉 你保住了你的腿
Well, thank you, Molly. You can keep your leg.

299
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:55,990
显然你不信任泰维纳
So, obviously you don't trust Taverner.

300
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:57,910
这是我们的共同点
We have that in common.

301
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,410
我猜你没告诉她照片的事
I presume you didn't tell her about the photograph

302
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:02,290
因为你知道她会下令销毁照片 对吗
because you know she'll have it destroyed, right?

303
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:08,960
很明智 现在到底是谁在缄默
Brilliant. Now who's being silent.

304
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:14,010
我离开伦敦警察厅是因为 我对能力和腐败等问题非常挑剔
I left the Met because I was picky about things like competence and corruption.

305
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:15,340
我以为军情五处会不一样
Thought MI5 would be different.

306
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:18,180
结果我在过去24小时内遇到的每一个混蛋
And every fucker I've met in the last 24 hours

307
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,340
都在耍我
has dicked me around.

308
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:21,220
你 兰姆 泰维纳 各自心怀鬼胎
You, Lamb, Taverner, you all have your own agenda.

309
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:22,850
别把我和泰维纳归为一类
Don't put me in the same bracket as Taverner...

310
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:24,220
- 我就该言听计从 - 还有兰姆
- I'm supposed to fall in line... - ...or Lamb.

311
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:26,140
不管那些强大的间谍们想要什么
...with whatever the mighty spooks want.

312
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:28,810
听着 也许我的行为是不太好理解
Look, maybe my actions have been hard to understand.

313
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:30,770
装死 把爷爷藏起来
Faking your own death, hiding your grandfather,

314
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:32,270
把一具尸体的脸打烂
shooting the face off a corpse.

315
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:34,980
好吧 如果你要逐一列举 那只会越描越黑
Okay, if you're gonna do the list thing, then that's gonna make it sound worse.

316
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:36,070
真聪明
That's very clever.

317
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,950
我所做的一切 只是为了保护我爷爷 仅此而已
All I've been trying to do is protect my grandfather. That's it.

318
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:40,160
结果如何呢
And how's that going?

319
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:44,330
你看 这张照片里的两个人都试图杀他
Look, two people in that photograph are trying to kill him,

320
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:46,660
我还不知道他在哪
and I don't know where he is,

321
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:48,540
而现在却被你铐在车门上
and now you've handcuffed me to a car door.

322
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,130
这有什么帮助
How's that helping?

323
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,540
因此你必须去找到他 得去阻止他们
So you have to find him and you have to stop them.

324
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:55,920
你唯一一次对我说真话就是下命令
Do you think it's appealing that the only time you open up to me

325
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:56,840
这样很好玩
is to give me orders?

326
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:59,180
你把我铐在车门上很好玩
Do you think it's appealing when you handcuff me to a car door?

327
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:03,140
把照片公布出去 立刻
Just get the photograph out there. Now.

328
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,560
这些人为什么想杀他
Why are these men trying to kill him?

329
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:08,310
此事一开始只有我和他知道
That's between me and him initially.

330
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:10,150
好吧 又开始各怀鬼胎了
All right, so we're back to hidden agendas.

331
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:14,020
听着 你之前跟我说过 如果有另一起韦斯特艾克斯案
Look, you said to me before that if there was another Westacres,

332
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:15,280
那就怪我
that would be on me.

333
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:18,400
如果我爷爷死了 那就怪你
Well, if my grandfather dies, that's gonna be on you.

334
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:39,550
吉提 我刚给你发了一张照片 查清楚上面的人都是谁 把它交给惠兰
Giti, I've just sent you a photo. Find out who's in it. Take it to Whelan.

335
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:44,510
你怎么确定她会交给惠兰
How can you be sure she's gonna give it to Whelan?

336
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:45,720
因为我也给他发了一份
Because I copied him in.

337
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:51,020
谢谢
Thank you.

338
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:20,210
- 我需要跟局长谈 - 杰克逊 这是哪
- I need to talk to First Desk. - Where are we, Jackson?

339
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:22,550
我需要跟局长谈
I need to speak to First Desk.

340
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,890
- 等等 - 好
- Wait. - Yes.

341
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:27,470
- 等等 - 杰克逊
- Wait. - Jackson.

342
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:31,520
我们来这里干吗 是等什么人吗
Well, what are we doing here? Are we waiting for someone?

343
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:34,600
他创造的这个“待命身份” 炸了韦斯特艾克斯
He created the cold body that blew up Westacres.

344
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:36,860
我必须查清他把这身份给了谁以及为什么
I need to find out who he gave it to and why.

345
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:39,030
可他只肯跟局长说
Well, he's only going to open up to First Desk.

346
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:40,440
他会跟我说的
He'll open up to me.

347
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:42,360
怎么 你要审讯他吗
What, you're going to interrogate him?

348
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:45,870
拜托 你说得太残暴了 我不会伤害他
Come on, you make it sound so brutal. I'm not gonna hurt him.

349
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:48,200
我可能不会伤害他
I'm probably not gonna hurt him.

350
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:51,830
来 大卫 我们来活动活动筋骨吧
Come on, David. Let's stretch our legs, eh?

351
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:04,760
难得清净一下 真好
It's good to get a bit of quiet.

352
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:07,720
你这几天真是遭罪了
I mean, you've had a hell of a couple of days.

353
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:14,690
你为什么带我来这里
Why have you brought me here?

354
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:20,070
你为什么带我来找罗丝
Why have you brought me to Rose?

355
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:24,280
你不肯回答我的问题 回答她的好了
Well, you won't answer to me. You can answer to her.

356
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:27,030
她不知道
She doesn't know.

357
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:28,490
(深切怀念罗丝卡特怀特)

358
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:30,160
不知道什么
Doesn't know what?

359
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,790
不知道一群无辜的顾客被炸成碎片
That a bunch of innocent shoppers got blown to pieces

360
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:36,960
因为你的所作所为 然后你还枪杀了她的孙子吗
because of what you did and then you shot her grandson?

361
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,210
我没枪杀瑞弗
I didn't shoot River.

362
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:42,050
我打死的是另外一个冒充瑞弗的人
I shot somebody else, somebody pretending to be River.

363
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:44,880
不...我以为是瑞弗 是你说的
No, no, I thought it was River. That's what you said.

364
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,470
杰克逊 别这样
Jackson, no.

365
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:47,850
不 我...
No, I--

366
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:50,930
我枪杀了瑞弗
I shot River.

367
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:53,270
- 你没有 - 他有 他知道是他干的
- No, you didn't. - Yes, he did. He knows he did.

368
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:55,640
- 我杀了他 - 你以前是找人
- I killed him. - You used to get people

369
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,770
替你杀人的 大卫
to do your killing for you, David.

370
00:21:57,770 --> 00:22:00,400
终于自己的手上沾上血了 感觉如何
How's it feel to finally get your hands dirty?

371
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,020
一定不好受吧
It must be tough though.

372
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:04,860
杀死一个所爱的人 不知道你怎么受得了
I mean, killing a loved one, I don't know how you can live with that.

373
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:06,490
- 大卫 - 他可能在天堂里
- David-- - They're probably up there

374
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:09,740
看着你心想 你在洗手间里 意识到自己做了什么后
looking down and wondering why you didn't blow your own brains out in that bathroom

375
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:11,530
为什么不一枪爆了自己的头
once you realized what you did.

376
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:13,580
别说了 你在折磨他
Look, stop it. You're torturing him.

377
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:16,250
对 我知道 这感觉好极了
Yeah, I know. And it feels fucking great.

378
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,250
大卫
David.

379
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:25,300
我是为她做的 全都是为了她
I did it for her. It was all for her.

380
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:26,470
对 为了罗丝
Yes, for Rose.

381
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:27,970
为了我们的女儿
For our daughter.

382
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:30,550
你的女儿
Your daughter?

383
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:32,850
我不明...
I don't u--

384
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:37,850
什么 法国那个女孩是你女儿
What, the girl in France, she was your daughter?

385
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:41,610
对 他把她从我们身边抢走
Yeah, he took her from us.

386
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,820
他就是个恶魔
He's a fucking monster.

387
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:48,280
大卫...他叫什么名字
David. What was his name, David?

388
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,660
他是个恶魔
He was a fucking monster.

389
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:53,620
谁 大卫
Who? David.

390
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,290
恶魔的名字叫什么
What was the name of the monster?

391
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:00,830
哈克尼斯 弗兰克哈克尼斯
Harkness. Frank Harkness.

392
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:04,090
他为什么是恶魔
What made him a monster?

393
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:09,760
他喜欢先发制人搞暗杀
Preemptive assassinations, that was his thing.

394
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:12,140
他想杀谁
Who did he want to kill?

395
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:14,930
他给我们弄来一份名单 暗杀对象名单
He brought us a list of targets.

396
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,890
都是些该死的人
People who deserved to die.

397
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:24,110
对 他想打造一支 被发现也能赖账的暗杀小队
Yes, he wanted to create a deniable assassination squad.

398
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:27,190
由从小培养的杀手组成
Killers raised from birth.

399
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:30,910
他彻底疯了 我们把他开除了
He was completely mad. We sent him away.

400
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:35,080
然后呢 你说他抢走了她 是绑架吗
And then what? You said he took her. You mean he kidnapped her?

401
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:38,790
不 她想跟他在一起 我当然不同意
No, she wanted to be with him. I couldn't let that happen.

402
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:41,540
我希望她离开他
I wanted to get her away from him.

403
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:45,710
这就是他以她为目标的原因
And that's why he targeted her.

404
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:52,760
我不得不满足他的要求 才能把她换回来
I had to give him what he wanted, you see, in order to get her back--

405
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:56,890
把她换回来 为了我 也为了罗丝
get her back for me, for Rose.

406
00:23:57,930 --> 00:24:01,560
我撒谎了 我什么都没告诉她
I lied. I didn't tell her anything about it.

407
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:08,860
也没告诉任何人
I didn't tell anybody anything.

408
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,110
如果你满足了他的要求
Well, then, if you gave him what he wanted,

409
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:12,700
他现在为什么追杀你
why is he after you now?

410
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:15,280
因为大卫可以把他 和韦斯特艾克斯案联系起来
Because David can link him to Westacres,

411
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:19,120
任何知道这关联的人都是他们杀害的目标
and anyone who knows that connection is on their kill list.

412
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:23,960
那我们必须把他送去总部了 他在外面不安全
Well, then we have to get him to the Park. He's not safe out here.

413
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:27,170
你答应瑞弗要照顾他的
Well, you promised River you'd look after him.

414
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:29,510
我觉得总部不是最佳藏身之地
I'm not sure the Park is the best place to hide.

415
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:32,510
他们也不想和韦斯特艾克斯扯上关系
They don't wanna be linked to Westacres either.

416
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:34,340
他们宁可他死在自家洗手间里
They'd rather he died in that bathroom.

417
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:36,600
那我怎么办
So, what do I do?

418
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:41,890
首先 你可以告诉他瑞弗还活着
Well, for a start, you can tell him River's alive.

419
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,650
不过这个可怜鬼也记不住
Not that the poor bastard will remember.

420
00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:52,570
大卫 走吧 天有些凉了
Oh, David, come on. It's getting a bit cold.

421
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,880
他供出卡特怀特了吗
Did he give up Cartwright?

422
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:11,880
我拿到了查普曼的手机 卡特怀特可能会打来
I've got Chapman's phone. Cartwright might call.

423
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:24,730
莫莉 这位是帕特里斯 帕特里斯 莫莉
Molly, Patrice. Patrice, Molly.

424
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:27,440
我知道
Oh, I know.

425
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:30,730
名字和面孔
Names and faces,

426
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:33,860
这让你认为 我拿到了想要的东西就会杀了你
makes you think I'm gonna kill you when I've got what I want.

427
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:37,620
莫莉 不过问题是 我确实要传达一个信息
The thing is, though, Molly, I do need to send a message

428
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,870
你来帮我
and you're gonna help me with that.

429
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:52,800
查普曼是这个杰克逊兰姆的老朋友
Chapman was an old friend of this guy, Jackson Lamb.

430
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:56,840
这群人里有人有谁来救他了
So, any of this crew the ones that came to his rescue?

431
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:58,470
兰姆开的车
Lamb was driving.

432
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:01,350
这两位当时也在场
And these two were there.

433
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:08,150
这个打败你的部门 是专门收容废柴和垃圾的
So that unit that got the better of you is for shitheels and burnouts.

434
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:14,110
怎么了
What's the matter?

435
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:17,660
我辜负了你 理应受到惩罚
I failed you. I should be punished.

436
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:22,450
我不会因为你杀个老头子 用了这么久而惩罚你的
I'm not gonna punish you for taking so long to kill an old man.

437
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:26,910
但我会因为你自我放纵而惩罚你
But I will punish you for self-indulgence.

438
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:30,380
我不需要你盯着自己的鞋 等着被揍
I don't need you staring at your shoes waiting to be hit.

439
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:33,380
我要你保持警惕 准备出击
I need you on your toes ready to strike.

440
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:36,090
看着我的眼睛
Fucking look me in the fucking eyes.

441
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:45,520
只有你和我 只剩我们俩了
It's you and me. We're the only ones left.

442
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:50,230
如果我不得不选一个人拯救 我会选你
And if I'd had to choose one to save, it would've been you.

443
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:57,490
把你的悲伤 耻辱和愤怒化为力量
So you channel your grief and your shame and your rage,

444
00:26:57,490 --> 00:27:01,700
我们来纠正此事 重新打造我们的王国
and we will put this right. We'll build again.

445
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:06,540
手足同心
No better friend,

446
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,830
同仇敌忾
no worse enemy.

447
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:13,000
好 你去就位吧
Okay. Go to your station.

448
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:50,040
好 开始了
Here we go. Showtime.

449
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,710
我让你来处理吧
I'll let you handle this.

450
00:27:53,290 --> 00:27:54,550
你真仁慈
That's very gracious of you.

451
00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:08,770
- 嗨 吉提 - 我搞定了
- Hi, Giti. - I've done it.

452
00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:13,270
是 我看到你核对了“待命身份”的行动
Yes, I saw you collated the movements of the cold bodies.

453
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:15,360
不 我是说照片
No, I meant the photo.

454
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:17,070
什么照片
What photo?

455
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:21,240
艾玛弗莱特发给我和局长的照片
The one that Emma Flyte sent me and First Desk.

456
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:28,580
老天啊 我该怎么把照片弄出来
Oh, Jesus Christ. How the hell do I get this off here?

457
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:29,700
弄不出来
You can't.

458
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:32,580
- 我对此完全不知... - 谁能给我看看这张照片吗
- I didn't know anything about this-- - Can someone please show me this photo?

459
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:34,710
当然 你有可以投屏的屏幕吗
Yes, of course. Do you have a screen I can link up to?

460
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:35,790
没有
No.

461
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:39,590
照片上有韦斯特艾克斯袭击者
It shows the Westacres bomber

462

with two other men. Another cold body there, Paul Wayne.

464
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:46,930
太厉害了 帽子戏法啊
Fucking brilliant. A hat trick.

465
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:48,010
这个人是谁
And who is this one?

466
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:50,930
弗兰克哈克尼斯 前特种部队 前中情局的
Frank Harkness, ex-Special Forces, ex-CIA.

00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:54,400
因不服从命令 贪污 盗窃武器和酷刑而被开除
Discharged for disobedience, embezzlement, weapons theft and torture.

468
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:59,070

Well done, Giti. Get their descriptions out there.

469
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,860
如果他们在国内 我们必须将其逮捕
If they're in the country, we need to bring them in.

470
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:02,450
是
Yes.

471
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:12,960
我们的水泥箱子不够大了 是吧
We don't have a concrete box big enough for this, do we?

472
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:14,750
不够大
No, we don't.

473
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,040
好样的
Good boy.

474
00:29:53,370 --> 00:29:54,620
好样的
Good boy.

475
00:29:57,790 --> 00:30:00,210
我查了莫伊拉提供的被开除医生
I've checked Moira's list of struck-off doctors.

476
00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:02,260
有一个今天早些时候死了
One of them died earlier today.

477

从楼梯上摔下去的
Fell down the stairs.

479
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:09,930
我查了那条街两头的监控
I checked the CCTV footage at either end of the street.

480
00:30:09,930 --> 00:30:12,930
这个人走进去时好像被德士撞过
Guy walks in looking like he was hit by a taxi.

481
00:30:12,930 --> 00:30:17,560
走出来时就像服用了高级止疼药
He walks out looking like he's had some very high-quality painkillers.

482
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:21,320
- 是你找的人吗  - 天啊 他几乎连腿都不瘸
- Is that your guy? - Jesus Christ, he's barely limping.

483
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:25,280
髋关节脱臼 他应该疼得昏过去才对
Dislocated his hip. He should be passed out from the pain.

484
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,070
他简直是个终结者
He's a fucking Terminator.

485
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:29,490
什么 他是液态金属做的变形机器人
What? He's a shape-shifter made of liquid metal?

486
00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:31,700
那是T1000 我说他比较像T800
That's the T-1000. I'm saying he's more like T-800.

487
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:34,620
老天 朗里奇 我现在都没眼看你了
Fucking hell, Longridge. I can't even look at you right now.

488
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:37,460
- 是 我在这待不下去了 - 我不以为耻 《终结者》是个好系列
- Yeah, I can't be in this room. - I'm not ashamed. It's a great franchise.

489
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:41,460
对了 特工抓到了瑞弗 在他爷爷家抓到的
Dogs have got River, by the way. Picked him up at his grandfather's house.

490
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:43,260
你之前为什么不直接告诉我
Why didn't you just tell me that straightaway?

491
00:30:44,170 --> 00:30:46,470
你打算怎么办 你看 卡特怀特安全了
What were you gonna do about it? Look, Cartwright's safe.

492
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:48,590
- 不用替他担心了 - 白痴
- Cross him off your worry list. - Idiot.

493
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:52,220
不过他惹了这么多祸 他们可能会把他彻底开除
Although, they'll probably throw him out for good for all the trouble he's caused.

494
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,600
好 你能调出来吗
All right, could you pull that up?

495
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:03,150
- 我就... - 喂
- Just gonna-- - Yeah?

496
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:05,030
瑞弗回来了 特工抓了他
River's back, the Dogs have him.

497
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:10,950
天啊 我帮他打了那么多掩护 他才坚持了一天
Jesus Christ. I gave him all that cover and he lasted a day.

498
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:12,330
至少他安全了
Well, at least he's safe.

499
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,160
查普曼可就难说了
Chapman might not be though.

500
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,660
想杀他的人还活蹦乱跳的
The guy that tried to kill him is still around.

501
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:17,960
你怎么知道
How do you know?

502
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:20,120
何查到他去看一个非法医生
Ho found him heading into a backstreet doctor

503
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:21,960
他接受治疗后就杀人灭口了
who he killed after getting treatment.

504
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:24,670
听着 斯坦迪什正要带大卫回斯劳部门
Listen, Standish is bringing David back to Slough House.

505
00:31:24,670 --> 00:31:27,470
把他关起来 别让总部知道
Lock him down and do not let the Park know.

506
00:31:29,050 --> 00:31:31,970
给 你开车 让我在地铁站下
Here, you drive. You can drop me at the tube.

507
00:31:31,970 --> 00:31:33,310
为什么不跟我们一起去
Why aren't you coming with us?

508
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,310
查普曼没有报平安
Chapman didn't check in.

509
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:37,770
他要把大卫送回来
He's bringing David back.

510
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,850
他不该送他去总部吗
Shouldn't he take him to the Park?

511
00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:41,020
显然不该
Apparently not.

512
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:49,490
嘿
Oi!

513
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:55,790
你在跟谁聊天
Who are you talking to?

514
00:31:57,160 --> 00:32:00,960
阿金 聊得很火热 她...
Kim. Smoking hot chat. She just--

515
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,840
她很懂我 你明白吗
She just, like, gets me, you know?

516
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:05,630
那是个机器人
That's a bot.

517
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:07,380
什么
What?

518
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:08,880
那是个机器人
That's a bot.

519
00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:12,340
我以前是给这种程序做行为分析的
I used to provide behavior analysis for these kind of programs.

520
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:14,050
它们会挑你爱听的话说
They tell you what you want to hear...

521
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:18,890
操纵你 目的是诈骗
manipulate you... for scams.

522
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:24,860
只有少数人会上当
Only a small percentage of people are duped.

523
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,700
- 但足以... - 你滚蛋吧
- But it's enough-- - Just fuck off, all right.

524
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,380
三分钟
Three minutes.

525
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:04,440
对了 之前的事抱歉了
Sorry about before, by the way.

526
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:07,440
让你们的人在圣潘克拉斯火车站兜圈子
Giving you guys the runaround at St. Pancras.

527
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:10,360
你其实差点就抓到我了
You actually got quite close.

528
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:14,320
你作为下等马还挺厉害
You're not bad for a Slow Horse.

529
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:19,080
好吧 我在最烂部门里排名中游 真好
Right. So I'm the middle rank of the shittiest group. That's nice.

530
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:25,460
我很想留下来聊天 但我有个紧急约会要赴
I'd love to stay and chat, but I have an urgent appointment to get to.

531
