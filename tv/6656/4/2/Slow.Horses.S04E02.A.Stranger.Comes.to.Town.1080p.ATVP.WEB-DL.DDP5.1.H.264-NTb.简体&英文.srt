If he's heard about Cartwright, he's gonna be jumpy.

508
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:46,540
�� Ҳ����
Yeah. Maybe.

509
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:51,550
����Ҳ������ Ҳ��������֪����Ϊʲô������
But he might have forgotten. Might not even know why he has to die.

510
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:29,100

I'll have the pork and a bottle of the house red.

511
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:31,480
����û��ǲ��Ⱦ���
I'd probably better not drink anything.

512
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:33,810
�Ǿ�ֻҪһƿ������ѡ���
Well, just a bottle of the house red then.

513
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:36,070

Thanks.

514
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:41,360

Over at the Park, you were across everything, right?

515
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:43,950
����ָ������Ա ����Ů��֮һ
In terms of personnel. One of the queens.

516
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:45,030

I was.

517
00:36:45,830 --> 00:36:48,370

If I didn't know the answer to a question, I knew who to ask.

518
00:36:49,410 --> 00:36:52,580
����˹�Ͳ������Ǳ�ְ�� ������
Bit of a comedown, Slough House, isn't it?

519
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:56,000
�Ҳ�������Ϊ ÿ���ط����и��Ե���ս
I don't see it as such. Every place has its challenges.

520
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,630
���ǻ������������� ����
And you were sent here by Whelan himself, yeah?

521
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:02,890
- ͸������ - �ǵ�
- Mr. Transparency. - I was.

522
00:37:02,890 --> 00:37:06,930
�����κ󲻾þͰ���ѡ������ �Ҿ������������ҵ�Ǳ��
He picked me out soon after he started. I think he saw something in me.

523
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:09,020
�����������Щ�����߶�Ū��������
And when you've sorted us reprobates out, what?

524
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:11,230
���ص��ܲ���������ȥ
You go back to your throne at the Park?

525
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:13,600
�Ҳ��������Ϊ������
I wouldn't go so far as to call you reprobates.

526
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,690
����
Really?

527
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:20,570
�� ����˹������ ѩ�򵤵� �����ѡ����
Ho, Marcus Longridge, Shirley Dander. To pick three at random.

528
00:37:20,570 --> 00:37:24,200
��ʵ Ҳ��˵�������ߡ��е�̫�º���
Actually maybe reprobates is a bit mild.

529
00:37:26,830 --> 00:37:28,490
�㲻�����
And you don't think that

530
00:37:28,490 --> 00:37:31,910
�����߶��������� ���Ե���ͬ������
the company you now find yourself in reflects badly on you?

531
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:33,000
������
Well, no.

532
00:37:35,830 --> 00:37:38,090
- �Ҳ�һ�� - ������
- I'm a different case. - Just fill it up.

533
00:37:40,090 --> 00:37:42,470
��������Ϊʲô���Լ�˵�Լ����ر��
Well, I see why you're telling yourself that you're special,

534
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:44,720
��Ϊ��ʵ̫���Խ���
because the truth is too hard to accept.

535
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:47,260
������Ϊ��֪�����Ǳ����䵽˹�Ͳ���
But I think you know that people are sent to Slough House

536
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:48,850
ԭ�����������
for one of two reasons.

537
00:37:49,770 --> 00:37:53,600
��һ ���Ƕ��Ǵ���� ������˵ ����Ȼ����
One, they're a total fuckup. Which as you said, you're clearly not.

538
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,770
����ҵİ칫�������úܺ�
I mean, you've reorganized my office brilliantly.

539
00:37:55,770 --> 00:38:00,480
������� ��ϣ���� ��Ҳ��Ҫ̤������һ��
And having said that, I never ever want you to step foot in there again.

540
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:04,030
�ڶ� ���ǲ�֪�����ص�����ĳ����
And two, they've unwittingly pissed someone off.

541
00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:05,110
������ô���
So, here's the deal.

542
00:38:08,450 --> 00:38:12,660
�һ�����Ϊʲô���ɵ���������
I will find out why you were sent to me

543
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:16,420
Ȼ����Ϳ��Թ����ܲ���
and then you can fuck off back to the Park.

544
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:17,710

And in return,

545
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:22,300
��Ҫ������ݿ�������Ǵ�绰
I want you to call your friends on the database
