1
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:11,380
我是兰姆
This is Lamb.

2
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:14,340
如果我没接电话 那是因为我不想跟你说话
If I didn't answer, it's because I don't want to speak to you.

3
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,980
喂 骗到你了吧 我是马库斯·朗里奇 请留言
Hello. Got you, didn't I? It's Marcus Longridge. Leave a message.

4
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:26,810
给 慢用 谢谢
Here you go. Enjoy. Cheers.

5
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:30,980
我是瑞弗 请留言
This is River. Leave a message.

6
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:37,660
喂
Hello?

7
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:40,950
终于有人接电话了
Finally. Someone picked up.

8
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:43,750
你在哪
Where are you?

9
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:45,420
关你屁事
None of your business.

10
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,790
好吧 你应该来鸡多多快餐的
Yeah, well, you're supposed to be at the Chickado.

11
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:48,880
为什么
Why?

12
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:51,170
我们的圣诞派对啊
Our Christmas party.

13
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:53,090
我们没有圣诞派对
We don't have a Christmas party.

14
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:56,430
如果有 那也是在圣诞节前开 而且不会在鸡多多快餐
And if we did, we'd have it before Christmas and not at a Chickado.

15
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:59,470
好吧 也许你没被邀请
Yeah. Well, maybe you're not invited.

16
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:01,430
也许兰姆只跟精英说了
Maybe Lamb only told the elites.

17
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:03,310
可兰姆跟你说了 对吧
Lamb told you about it though, didn't he?

18
00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:08,150
我问他圣诞派对在哪开 他就把细节告诉我了
I asked him where the Christmas party was, and he gave me the details.

19
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:09,230
是啊
Right.

20
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,900
你想想看是怎么回事吧
See if you can work out what happened.

21
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:22,160
好吧 也得是局内人才会被耍 所以
Yeah, well, you gotta be in the game to get played, so...

22
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:25,580
喂
Hello?

23
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:25,020
在韦斯特艾克斯购物中心
At Westacres shopping center.

24
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,430
确认 是汽车炸弹
Confirmed there's a car bomb.

25
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:30,560
(韦斯特艾克斯)

26
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:33,770
局长来了
First Desk approaching.

27
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:01,470
我是克劳德·惠兰局长
Claude Whelan, First Desk.

28
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:02,640
你是 特工辛格
And you are? Agent Singh.

29
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,010
好 长官
Right. Ma'am.

30
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,600
这种事 没法形容
I mean, something like this, there are-There are no words.

31
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,810
真是
It's just...

32
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,360
我们确认了是汽车炸弹
We're confirmed it's a car bomb?

33
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,230
是 长官 监控拍到了
Yes, ma'am. We have it on CCTV.

34
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:18,740
司机在车上 所以是自杀式袭击
Driver was in the car, so it was a suicide attack.

35
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,950
袭击购物中心 老天啊
On a shopping center. My God.

36
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:24,200
汽车驶过步行区
Car drives up through the pedestrianized area,

37
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,370
人群四散
people scatter,

38
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:30,250
他直接驶进入口 然后引爆
he drives straight into the entrance and detonates.

39
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:31,710
天啊
Jesus Christ.

40
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:33,380
有那辆车的信息吗
What do we know about the car?

41
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:37,920
是以罗伯特·温特斯的名字租的 28岁的自由职业IT顾问
Hired under the name Robert Winters, 28-year-old freelance IT consultant,

42
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,050
但从他的背景中看不出他这么干的原因
but nothing in his background to indicate why he did this.

43
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:43,840
用监控查他的行踪 我们必须知道他从哪来的
Track his journey on CCTV. We need to know where he came from.

44
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,850
我们查了他给租车公司的地址 位于莱斯特
We checked the address in Leicester he gave to the hire-car company.

45
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:49,470
那里已经很多年没人住了
Nobody's been there in years.

46
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:52,440
邻居们从没见过或听说过温特斯
Neighbors have never seen nor heard of Winters.

47
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:54,610
天啊
Jesus.

48
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,020
也许他是个幽灵人
So maybe he's a ghost.

49
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:59,610
有可能 这也许是一次性袭击事件
Could be this is a one-off.

50
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:02,530
也可能是某件事的开端
Or the start of something.

51
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:10,040
我们访问了一些伦敦人
And from talking to people in London, it seems

52
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:13,830
似乎整个社区依然很焦虑
that a sense of anxiety remains across the community.

53
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:17,670
在最新一次行动里 武装警察进驻部分地铁列车
In the latest move, armed police have been placed on some trains,

54
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:21,760
虽然这更像是增加自信的举措
although this feels more of a confidence-boosting measure

55
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,800
而不是针对某一特定威胁的应对
than a response to a specific threat.

56
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:28,100
你真的认为他从属于一个组织吗
Do you really think he is part of a network?

57
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:31,180
我想下一次袭击间隔越久
I guess the longer it goes without another attack,

58
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:33,560
他越可能是独狼吧
the more likely he's just a lone wolf.

59
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:36,230
我讨厌“独狼”这个词 让他显得很神秘
I hate the term "lone wolf." Makes him sound edgy.

60
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:38,020
他只是个杀人的混蛋
He's just a murderous prick.

61
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:39,690
对 我们重新敬酒
Right. We'll do that again.

62
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:42,440
我们刚刚向一个 杀人的混蛋敬酒 说点别的
We just toasted a murderous prick. Say something else.

63
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:47,910
祝我们明年这个时候不在斯劳部门了
To not being in Slough House this time next year.

64
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:50,490
好 不太可能
Yeah. That's unlikely.

65
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:51,790
除非我们辞职
Unless we just quit.

66
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:56,500
你其实不想辞职
You don't actually wanna do that,

67
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,580
对吧
do you?

68
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:01,050
其实吧 我一直想辞职 真的
Well, I'm always thinking about it. Yeah.

69
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:04,550
太好了
Great.

70
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:09,350
总之呢 有件事
Anyway, yeah, there's just been something

71
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:13,020
我一直想跟你说 就是
that I've wanted to share with you for a while, and, you know,

72
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:15,770
我想在办公室之外说 好吧
I wanted to do it outside of the office... Okay.

73
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:20,520
我觉得我可以跟你说
...and I've felt like I could share that with you

74
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,570
因为我们 我觉得我们的关系更亲近了
'cause we've-I think we've gotten closer.

75
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,110
是的 所以
Uh-huh. And...

76
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:29,530
我不想越界什么的
I don't want to overstep the mark or anything,

77
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:32,330
如果你想保持我们之间的工作关系 我完全理解
and I get it if you want to keep it to work when it comes to us.

78
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:33,410
瑞弗 抱歉 就是
Oh, River. I'm sorry. Just--

79
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:35,040
我是喜欢你 但 但我爷爷
I do like you, but-But my grandfather--

80
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:39,540
什么 不 你爷爷 说吧
What? No, your grandfather. Yeah.

81
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:40,920
是 你刚才说什么
Yeah, what did you just say?

82
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,840
我没 没什么 你继续 你以为我要说什么
I didn't-No. Go on. Carry on. What did you think I was gonna say?

83
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,050
你以为我要约你出去 才不是
Did you think I was gonna ask you out? No, I didn't.

84
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:48,720
你就是 不是 好吧 我是
Yes, you did. Yeah, you did. I didn't. Okay, I did.

85
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,720
但那是因为你要求午餐时出来喝酒
But that's because you asked for a drink at lunchtime

86
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,680
想跟我说一件事
'cause you wanted to talk to me about something,

87
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,430
然后你啰哩啰嗦说什么感觉
and then you started whanging on about how close

88
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:57,310
我们更亲近了 是 啰哩啰嗦
you felt to me and then-Yeah. Whanging on?

89
00:05:57,310 --> 00:06:00,360
是真的 我感觉跟你更亲近了 现在能说你爷爷的事了吗
Well, I do. I feel closer to you. Can we go on to your grandfather now?

90
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,400
好
Okay.

91
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,950
我觉得他越来越 越来越什么
I think he's going-Going where?

92
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,030
就是
Like...

93
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:16,620
他总是犯糊涂
He's just confused all the time.

94
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,370
什么都记不住
Forgets everything.

95
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:20,830
上了年纪的人不都是这样吗
Isn't that just part of aging?

96
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:22,710
他得有80多岁了吧 不
He's like, what, 80-something? No, no.

97
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:24,800
他认为自己被“白鼬”监视
He thinks he's being watched by stoats.

98
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,880
白鼬是什么
What are stoats?

99
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,590
他那一代人对监视特工的叫法
It's what his generation call watchers.

100
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:29,930
他现在睡觉时床头放一支枪
He's sleeping with a gun by the bed.

101
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:31,010
就是
Like...

102
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,060
你觉得他是不是应该进敬老院
Do you think that maybe he should be in a home?

103
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,520
是 我觉得应该 但怎么跟他说啊
Yeah. Yeah, I do. But do you wanna tell him that?

104
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:42,900
上次我见他 他基本上头十分钟
You know, the last time I saw him, he genuinely didn't know who I was

105
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,610
根本认不出我
for, like, the first ten minutes.

106
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:47,190
完全不认识
No idea.

107
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,070
不停地跟我说他孙子瑞弗的事 我不能
He kept telling me about his grandson River. I can't--

108
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,580
看他这样我太难受了
It's horrible to see it.

109
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:58,960
确实不幸
Well, tough shit.

110
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,750
什么 是他把你带大的
What? He is the one that raised you.

111
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:05,960
没人管你时 是他照顾你
He is the one that looked after you when no one else did.

112
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,380
现在轮到你照顾他了
So now it's your turn.

113
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:11,550
你必须去看看他 今晚就去
You need to go and see him. Tonight.

114
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:15,180
不是 我知道 对 我知道
No, I know, I know. Yeah, I know. Yeah.

115
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:19,890
我只是需要听你对我说这些话
I just needed you to tell me that.

116
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:02,100
我知道你在 出来吧 让我看看你 来啊
I know you're there. Come on. Let me see you. Come on.

117
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:06,610
出来啊
Come on!

118
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:10,740
出来吧 我知道你在 来啊
Come on. I know you're there. Come on.

119
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:11,950
让我看看你
Let me see you.

120
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,360
出来吧
Come on!

121
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:44,500
瑞弗
Oh, River.

122
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:46,710
能让我进去吗 我浑身湿透了
Can you let me in? I'm getting soaked.

123
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:48,330
当然
Yes, of course.

124
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,130
进来
Come in.

125
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:55,050
你怎么不打电话提前说一声 还是说你打了
Why didn't you call? Or maybe you did.

126
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:59,010
我打了 但你没接 我要用下厕所
I did call you, but you didn't answer. I'm just gonna run up to the loo.

127
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,770
交通糟透了 这样吧 我既然都上楼了 给你放一缸洗澡水如何
Traffic was awful. And I'll tell you what, shall I run you a bath while I'm up there?

128
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,560
看起来你也淋雨了
Looks like you got caught in the rain too.

129
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:06,890
太难受了
It's just awful.

130
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:02,450
就快好了 爷
Almost ready, Gramps.

131
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,720
你不是我孙子
You're not my grandson.

132
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:28,480
别开枪 是我 瑞弗啊
Whoa. It's me. It's River.

133
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:32,190
拜托 请把枪放下好吗
C-Please. Can you put the gun down please?

134
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:45,030
天啊
Oh, my God.

135
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:50,660
天啊 我干了些什么
Oh, my God. What have I done?

136
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,130

00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,800
该死
Fuck.

138
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:27,700
我是兰姆
Lamb.

139
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:34,490
见鬼
Fuck.

140
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,650
我进一步了解情况后打给你
I'll call you when I've got more info.

141
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:05,150
他们在勘查现场 但是 他刚到
They were going through stuff, but-He's just arrived.

142
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:06,490
我回头给你回电话
I'll call you back.

143
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,490
你是兰姆
You're Lamb?

144
00:15:11,530 --> 00:15:13,530
这么晚了 我还惨遭质疑
This time of night, I'm plagued by doubts.

145
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:16,700
我叫艾玛·弗莱特 接替达菲的人
I'm Emma Flyte. Duffy's replacement.

146
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,960
一看就比达菲强
Well, you're already an improvement.

147
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:23,630
我指的是你不是脑残 也没有昏迷不醒
On account of not being brain-dead and in a coma.

148
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:26,000
小道消息说是你手下人导致他昏迷的
The grapevine says it was one of yours put him in that coma.

149
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,840
小道消息说什么的都有 但大多数不靠谱
Well, the grapevine says a lot of things, but it's mostly the wine talking.

150
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:33,510
达菲之前那位可厉害多了
The guy before Duffy was altogether classier.

151
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:35,140
坏人山姆·查普曼
Bad Sam Chapman.

152
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:37,220
只是个绰号而已
That was just a name.

153
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:38,930
没那么坏
Wasn't that bad.

154
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:41,730
除了弄丢两亿五千万英镑这一点
Except for that bit about losing a quarter of a billion pounds.

155
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,310
我说他还不坏
Well, I said he wasn't bad.

156
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:46,190
没说他完美无缺
Didn't say he was perfect.

157
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:49,950
带我看看犯罪现场吧
Want to show me the damage?

158
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:51,740
你认识卡特怀特先生
You know Mr. Cartwright?

159
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:55,530
我有不在场证明 我当时在和戴女士蒸桑拿
I have an alibi, I was in a sauna with Lady Di.

160
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:56,870
你可以问她
You can ask her.

161
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:58,040
你认识卡特怀特先生
Do you know Mr. Cartwright?

162
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,910
哪个 随便 两个
Which one? Either. Both.

163
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:03,080
年轻那个是我的手下
Well, the younger one works for me.

164
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:06,130
爷爷曾给过我一份工作
The grandfather gave me a job once.

165
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:10,880
鞋不错啊
They're nice shoes.

166
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:13,260
你有服装补贴
You get a clothing allowance?

167
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:21,890
该死
Fucking hell.

168
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,610
准备好了
You ready?

169
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,000
所以你是那些弃子的负责人
So, you're in charge of the rejects.

170
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:44,250
他们不喜欢被称为弃子
They don't like being called that.

171
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:46,380
那你怎么叫他们 弃子
What do you call them? The rejects.

172
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:51,300
这里 亲爱的 看 你漏掉了一点
Here, love, look. You missed a bit.

173
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,220
里面惨不忍睹
It's bad in there.

174
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,810
我见过惨的
I've seen bad before.

175
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,450
有人在21点03分按下了应急按钮
Someone pressed the panic button at 2103.

176
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:20,620
本地警察21点49分抵达
Local police arrived 2149.

177
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:23,540
出警可真快 还好不是紧急情况
It's a good job it wasn't an emergency.

178
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:26,960
老人家上周按下过两次按钮
The old man pressed the button twice the week before.

179
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:29,670
一次是因为他忘了按钮的用途 想按下去看看
Once because he'd forgotten what it was for and wanted to find out.

180
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:33,550
应急按钮是可追踪的 有人提到吗
Those panic buttons are traceable, anyone mention that?

181
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:34,840
谢了 我会写个注释
Thanks. I'll make a note.

182
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:37,510
但我已经追踪到他这个了 在厨房餐桌上
But I've already traced his particular button to the kitchen table.

183
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,310
你看了按钮下面吗
Did you look underneath it?

184
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,850
你在找什么
What are you looking for?

185
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:47,230
我可舒适泡腾片
Alka-Seltzer.

186
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:51,900
我平常不喝酒 但我晚餐前喝了雪利酒
Not normally a drinker, but I had a sherry before dinner.

187
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:54,650
这是犯罪现场 不是药房
This is a crime scene, not a chemist's.

188
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:58,410
他中了两枪 一枪胸口 一枪正脸
He was shot twice. Once in the chest, once in the face.

189
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:00,870
似乎有些过分
Seems excessive.

190
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:03,120
虽然他有时挺烦人的 这我承认
Though he could be annoying, I'll give you that.

191
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,540
你似乎不太关心啊
You don't seem too concerned.

192
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,830
我之前也损失过特工 你以前是一线特工
I've lost joes before. You were an active.

193
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:10,000
对 那时你还穿纸尿裤呢
Yeah, when you were still in mittens.

194
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:13,840
他当时身上带着这个
He was carrying this.

195
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:16,840
手机和钱包 都是卡特怀特的
Phone and wallet? Both Cartwright's.

196
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,800
那你找我干什么
What the fuck do you need me for then?

197
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,140
正式确认身份
Formal identification.

198
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,470
这可有点难
It's a bit of a challenge.

199
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:25,310
他身上有特别的记号吗
Well, did he have any identifying marks?

200
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:28,060
他本来是有脸的 有用吗
He used to have a face. That any help?

201
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:32,070
文身 伤疤 穿孔饰品 我怎么知道
Tattoos, scars, piercings? Now, how the fuck would I know?

202
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:34,320
我要求他们上班时得穿衣服
I make 'em wear clothes around the office.

203
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:36,570
是他吗
Is it him?

204
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,870
对 是他
Yeah, it's him.

205
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:46,870
你确定
You're sure?

206
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,750
是瑞弗·卡特怀特
It's River Cartwright.

207
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:01,640
那他在哪 谁在哪
So, where is he then? Where's who?

208
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,930
那个老不死的
The old bastard.

209
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:06,980
我们以前就这么叫他
That's what we used to call him.

210
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,980
他真的是个混蛋 我可以保证
And he was a bastard. I can guarantee that.

211
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:13,480
我们不知道
We have no idea.

212
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:18,990
我猜你想低调处理此事 毕竟韦斯特艾克斯刚出事
I imagine you wanna keep this quiet, what with Westacres.

213
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:21,030
韦斯特艾克斯和此事有什么关系
What does Westacres have to do with this?

214
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:22,870
没什么
Nothing.

215
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:27,040
但炸弹在伦敦爆炸 这是情报处掉链子
But a bomb goes off in London, it's an Intelligence Service fuckup,

216
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,870
很讽刺 恰好我们这位 小卡特怀特也是个废物
which ironically describes our young Cartwright.

217
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:33,420
如果此事公开 网上那些键盘侠一定会误会
When this gets out, the keyboard nutters will be joining the wrong dots.

218
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:35,090
公开前我们就能调查完毕
We'll wrap it up before it comes to that.

219
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:39,760
接下来的声音是我在表达自信
Well, the next sound you hear will be me expressing confidence.

220
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:43,970
厉害了
Impressive.

221
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,310
你能想放就放
Can you do that to order?

222
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,600
怎么 想再听一声
Why? Do you want another?

223
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:50,440
你真是既恶心又失礼
You are gross and inappropriate.

224
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:53,770
我正伤心难过呢 表达方式欠妥罢了
I'm working through my grief. It comes out in off ways.

225
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:57,230
你知道老卡特怀特可能去哪了吗
Any idea where Cartwright senior might go?

226
00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:01,410
不知道 我回去继续睡觉了
No. I'm going back to bed.

227
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:05,120
你不考虑洗个澡吗
Would you also consider a shower?

228
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:07,120
好啊 这个提议很诱人
Yeah, it's a tempting offer,

229
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,080
但我觉得现在不合适
but I don't think that's appropriate right now.

230
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:12,620
毕竟抛开其他事不谈 我的一位队员刚刚死掉
I mean, apart from anything else, one of my team just died.

231
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:40,320
(内附罚款通知单 警告)

232
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:20,110
(局长 克劳德·惠兰)

233
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:21,190
进来
Come in.

234
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,860
看到温特斯驾车闯入
...shows that Winters drove into the venue--

235
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:28,830
克劳德 我有 戴安娜 太感谢你了
Claude, I've got s-Diana, thank you so much for this.

236
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:31,370
这是我第一次参加 政府危机应对委员会会议
It'll be my first COBRA meeting, so I was wondering

237
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:34,040
所以我想问 你能不能跟我说说会议大致内容
if you might be able to give me a rundown of what to expect?

238
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:37,920
好 可以 我 拜托了 如果你不介意的话
Okay. Yep. Well, I'm-Please, if you wouldn't mind.

239
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,710
我最近很忙 所以 对 是的
I've got a lot going on, so... Right. Yes.

240
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:43,010
我就只挑重点说了 可以吗
...I'll just stick to the headlines, if that's all right.

241
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:44,470
当然 有劳了
Sure, if you wouldn't mind.

242
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:47,220
要言简意赅 言简意赅
Keep it short but dense. Short, dense.

243
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:48,970
强调人工情报的缺陷
Stress the frailty of HUMINT.

244
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:51,930
别怕说不知道
Don't be afraid to say you don't know,

245
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:53,810
别说任何无法反覆验证的东西
don't say anything that can't be triple-sourced,

246
00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:55,480
别告诉他们任何你不希望泄露的事
and don't tell them anything you don't want leaked.

247
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,980
好 一定 你可以无视国防部部长
Yes, of course. You can ignore the Defense Secretary,

248
00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:01,730
他只会想方设法削弱你 以提升军方情报处的地位
he'll only want to undermine you to boost the standing of military intelligence.

249
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:04,700
我还必须警告你 如果首相反对你的任何提议
And I have to warn you, if the PM objects to anything you suggest,

250
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,320
内政大臣就会落井下石
the Home Secretary will put the boot in,

251
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:09,950
即使她刚刚赞同了你所有的话
even though she's agreed to everything you have just said,

252
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:12,790
但 你会没事的 好 谢谢
but-I mean, you'll be fine. Yeah, but thanks--

253
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:16,120
但我是来通知你 又有一个人死了
But I came to tell you that there's been another death.

254
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:19,540
什么 又有炸弹袭击
What, another bomb?

255
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:20,920
不
No, no.

256
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:24,010
是枪击案 和炸弹袭击事件无关
A shooting. Unrelated.

257
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:28,300
但受害人是一名特工 不
But the victim is an agent. Oh, no.

258
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:33,520
瑞弗·卡特怀特 被他爷爷大卫·卡特怀特击毙
River Cartwright, shot by his grandfather, David Cartwright.

259
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,850
大卫·卡特怀特
David Cartwright?

260
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:38,310
但他不是我们最厉害的特工吗
But he was supposed to be one of our finest, wasn't he?

261
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:40,060
我是从没见过他啦 但是
I mean, I never met him, but--

262
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:44,360
不好意思 他为什么要枪杀亲孙子
I'm sorry, why on earth did he shoot his grandson?

263
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:48,860
显然他误把他当成闯入者了 但弗莱特控制了调查
Apparently he mistook him for an intruder, but Flyte's got it locked down.

264
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:51,490
好 对了 你觉得她怎么样
Right. How's she working out for you?

265
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:53,660
很好 是了 我知道她不是你选的
Good. Yes. I know she wasn't your choice.

266
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:55,120
她是我选的
She was my choice.

267
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,080
只不过她选的条件是你的
It was the terms of her choosing that were yours.

268
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:00,830
我觉得你会看到 招个外人有什么好处的 戴安娜
Well, I think you'll see the benefits of bringing in an outsider, Diana.

269
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:03,380
她不受任何内部政治的影响
I mean, she's unswayed by any internal politics,

270
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:06,130
这些都有助于她的可信度
all helps with the accountability drive, you know?

271
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:08,930
不要把卡特怀特的事公开
Let's not share this Cartwright incident with the public.

272
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:11,720
在找到大卫前不要 我们知道发生了什么
Not until we've found David and we know what the hell happened.

273
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:14,720
好的 没错 我能明白其中道理 真是悲剧 戴安娜
Yeah. No, I can see the sense in that. Tragic. Diana?

274
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,810
是
Yep.

275
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:18,440
我在想 你会不会
Was just wondering-Just wondering whether you might

276
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:21,520
希望替我去参加 这个政府危机应对委员会会议
prefer to attend this COBRA meeting rather than me?

277
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,270
这是局长的职责
That's a First Desk duty.

278
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:25,780
大家都说 你在接替蒂尔尼期间
But by all accounts, you did such a sterling job

279
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:27,650
做得非常出色
filling in after Tearney.

280
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:30,990
鉴于目前的严峻形势 再加上你显然经验丰富
Given the gravity of the situation and obviously your experience,

281
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:35,120
我认为也许你去出席 他们会自在得多
I think they'd be a lot more comfortable, you know, with you being present

282
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,250
回头你再向我汇报 好吗
and reporting back to me. Yes?

283
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:40,080
当然
Absolutely.

284
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:43,500
是吗 你答应了 这 太好了 是的 你说什么都行
Yes? Is that okay? Is it o-Great. Yes. Yep. Anything you say.

285
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,000
非常感谢 谢谢
Thank you so much. Thank you.

286
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:55,970
好了
Right.

287
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:04,860
你为什么炸韦斯特艾克斯
Why did you bomb Westacres?

288
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:08,490
你的组织里有多少人
How many are in your network?

289
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:13,410
下一个目标是什么
What is the next target?

290
00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:16,910
嘿
Hey.

291
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:20,250
下一个目标是什么
What is the next target?

292
00:24:22,370 --> 00:24:25,590
这就是让嫌疑人招供的方法 让我去审问即可
That's how you get a suspect to talk. Just put me in a room with them.

293
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:29,880
如果真有事瞒着你 我可以坚持更久的
I could've held out longer if I was actually holding something from you.

294
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:33,840
不 所有人都有扛不住的时候 我坚持了多久
No, everyone's got a breaking point. What was mine?

295
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,970
七秒 就七秒
Seven seconds. Is that all?

296
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:41,520
好了 给钱 见鬼
Right. Pay up. Fuck's sake.

297
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:48,230
真好 200个
Lovely. 200.

298
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:49,440
行 好
Yeah, all right.

299
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:53,450
现在我知道是什么体验了 我觉得我能坚持一分钟
Now I know what it's like, I reckon I could do a full minute.

300
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:55,200
是啊 真的
Yeah. Yeah.

301
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:01,160
这里到底怎么了 漏水了吗
What on earth's been going on here? Do we have a leak?

302
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,370
没有 他给我用水刑来着
No. He's been waterboarding me.

303
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:04,960
为什么
Why?

304
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,670
打赌 曲别针
For a bet. Paper clips.

305
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:09,250
曲别针是他的戒赌“镇静剂”
Paper clips are his gambling methadone.

306
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:14,180
这个办公室已经够乱的了
This office is in enough of a state already.

307
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,600
一定要把头发擦干 亲爱的
Do dry your hair, dear.

308
00:25:21,810 --> 00:25:23,600
当年在总部
You know, back at the Park,

309
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,940
我是“数据库女王”的办公桌分配员之一
I was one of the Desk Allocators to the Queens of the Database.

310
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:28,230
你说过了
You have mentioned it.

311
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:30,190
我依然不知道那是什么意思
Still not sure what it means.

312
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:33,610
意思就是我坐在所有部门主管的对面
It means that I was across the management of every office.

313
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:36,660
我知道谁什么时候在做什么
I knew who was doing what, when.

314
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:39,700
我觉得管理这地方更具挑战
And I find running this place more of a challenge.

315
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:42,870
你们打算什么时候把圣诞装饰收起来
When are you going to pack up the Christmas decorations?

316
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:45,000
我们抛硬币决定了 雪莉会收
We flipped for it. Shirley's gonna do it.

317
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,250
才不是 三局两胜
No, I'm not. Best of three.

318
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:49,590
趁还没给我们惹上霉运 快把饰品收好
Well, just pack them up before you bring us bad luck.

319
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:52,090
我们的运气已经不能更霉了
Our luck can't get any worse.

320
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:55,300
该死
Blast.

321
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:59,430
我把这些上周的文件退给你们
I'm giving you these back from last week.

322
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:03,230
怎么 是议会收到的噪音投诉清单
What, the list of noise complaints to councils?

323
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:05,890
这些需要按日期排序 是
They need to be in date order. Right.

324
00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:09,360
好吧 凯瑟琳要求 这种文件按投诉数量分类 所以
Right, well, Catherine wanted things like this grouped by number of complaints, so...

325
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,110
凯瑟琳不在这里 对吗
Catherine's not here, is she?

326
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:15,070
随便啦
Whatever.

327
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:17,570
我们怎么做都没意义
Pointless however we do it.

328
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:22,200
早上好 JK 小心脚下
Morning, JK. Do watch your footing.

329
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:25,580
还是你喜欢被称为科
Would you prefer Coe?

330
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:29,710
科先生
Mr. Coe?

331
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:38,720
他说过话吗 一个字也没说过
Has he said anything yet? Not a word.

332
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:41,350
说实话 我对他这个状态感到很开心
Which, to be honest with you, I'm pretty happy about.

333
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,730
他常常做这个动作
He just does this?

334
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:49,770
在工作间隙就做 对 所以请赶快给他点活干吧
In between work, yeah, so please give him some work quick.

335
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:10,460
1.95镑
1.95.

336
00:27:15,130 --> 00:27:16,970
(恶魔的心态)

337
00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:20,180
什么人会炸满是顾客的购物中心啊
What kind of person blows up a shopping center full of people?

338
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,300
让人不禁去想下一个目标是什么
Makes you wonder what's next.

339
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:25,970
是 下一个是佳发蛋糕
Yes. Jaffa Cakes. That's what's next.

340
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:28,560
再来点我可舒适
And some Alka-Seltzer.

341
00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:34,400
给 谢谢
There you go. Cheers.

342
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:42,370
你们摧毁了我
You have crushed me.

343
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:47,500
对我施暴
Wreaked violence upon me.

344
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:52,330
只有现在我才能得到自由
Only now will I be free.

345
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:53,460
两分钟后抵达
Two minutes out.

346
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:59,760
我被你们的系统囚禁多年 你们将为此付出代价
You will suffer for the years I spent imprisoned by your system.

347
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:06,350
上帝自有安排 我不会是最后一个
God willing, I will not be the last.

348
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:18,690
你们很快会从我兄弟们那里听到消息 怎么样
You will hear from my brothers soon. Well?

349
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:20,900
兰姆确认了尸体就是瑞弗·卡特怀特
Lamb identified the body as River Cartwright.

350
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:21,990
那就确定了
That's confirmed, then?

351
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:23,740
兰姆给你惹麻烦了吗
Lamb give you any trouble?

352
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:25,580
我之前对付过兰姆这样的男人
I've dealt with men like Lamb before.

353
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:26,870
我觉得你没有
I don't think you have.

354
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:28,790
大卫在哪 依然下落不明
Where's David? Still missing.

355
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:31,460
一位邻居听到半夜时有汽车驶离
A neighbor heard a car drive off in the middle of the night.

356
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:32,880
可恶的卡特怀特一家
Those bloody Cartwrights.

357
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,420
他们为什么 非要在我们忙不过来时搞这些
Why do they have to do this when we're stretched so thin?

358
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,750
找到老卡特怀特
Find Cartwright senior.

359
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:39,170
我不是该调查韦斯特艾克斯案
Shouldn't I be on Westacres?

360
00:28:39,170 --> 00:28:41,430
我听说你们追踪到了 炸弹袭击者所在的公寓
I heard you traced the bomber back to a flat.

361
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:43,470
此刻正有一支武装小队突袭那里
There's an armed unit going in right now.

362
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:46,010
我要你去查卡特怀特谋杀案
I want you on the Cartwright murder.

363
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:51,350
两分钟后抵达 长官 有人进出公寓吗
Two minutes out, ma'am. Has anyone been in or out of the flat?

364
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:53,310
我们开始监视后还没有
Not since we've had eyes on it.

365
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:57,320
长官 这是温特斯 昨天下午1点刚过时出门的画面
Ma'am, this is Winters setting out just after 1:00 p.m. yesterday.

366
00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:00,280
我们从今天凌晨4点就开始监视了 无人机也已升空
We've been on it since 4:00 a.m. today. Our drones are up.

367
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,990
窗帘都拉上了 所以我们无法确定
Curtains are drawn, so we can't be certain,

368
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,610
但据我们所知 那里没有其他人
but as far as we know, there's no one else in there.

369
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:06,490
这不代表里面没人 也许有共犯
Doesn't mean there isn't. Might be accomplices.

370
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:09,490
把那些小孩撤离
Move those children.

371
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:12,330
好 把那些小孩撤离
Okay. Move those children.

372
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,690
嗨 抱歉 我迟到了
Hi. Sorry I'm late.

373
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:44,490
后面有动静吗
Any activity at the back?

374
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:45,610
还是没有 长官
Still nothing, ma'am.

375
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:10,430
行动
Proceed.

376
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:19,190
警察 阿尔法1队进入大楼

385
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,190
他活得像个和尚
He lived like a monk.

386
00:30:58,770 --> 00:31:00,110
公寓安全 长官
The flat's clear, ma'am.

387
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:01,940
这里没什么东西
There's not much to go on here.

388
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:05,440
让鉴证科的人过去 我要把那公寓翻个底朝天
Get forensics in there. I want every inch of that flat turned over.

389
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,740
明白
Understood.

390
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:12,580
好 兄弟们 让白大褂来搞科学调查吧
Right, boys, let's let the white coats in here to do their science.

391
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:13,660
长官
Sir.

392
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:15,790
找到一本护照
I found a passport.

393
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:18,710
和他用来租车的身份一致
It's the same ID he used to hire the car.

394
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:21,170
(罗伯特迈克尔温特斯 英国公民)
他没有隐藏身份
He wasn't hiding himself.

395
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:23,960
因为他知道自己要死了
Because he knew he was gonna die.

396
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,430
科学专家来了
Here come the boffins.

397
00:31:29,010 --> 00:31:31,220
希望你们这些野蛮人没有把这里搞乱
Hope you animals haven't trashed the place.

398
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:32,930
没什么可搞乱的
Nothing to trash.

399
00:31:32,930 --> 00:31:36,480
彻查整个公寓 有些多余的衣物 靴子 一个睡袋
Swept the whole flat, some spare clothes, boots, sleeping bag.

400
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,560
大概就这些 对
That's about it, yeah.

401
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:39,100
走吧 滚蛋
Go on then. Fuck off.

402
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:40,940
给这里来点光线吧
Let's shed some light on this place.

403
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:46,490
该死
Shit.

404
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:55,240
出什么事了

长官 三人死亡 见鬼

408

409
00:32:04,670 --> 00:32:05,840

Evacuate the entire block, and get a new team in.

411

We need to know if there's a second bomber.

412
00:32:10,930 --> 00:32:11,930

I suppose I better update the PM again and issue a statement.

421
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,670
不 你必须先通知家属
No. You have to tell the families first.

422
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:43,580
他们不能从新闻上得知此事
They can't find out about this on the news.

423

Sick joke, Ho.

437
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:42,770
不是玩笑 是事实
It's not a joke. It's a fact.

438

你怎么知道的 兰姆告诉我的
How would you know? Lamb told me.

439
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:47,480

Lamb told you what?

440
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:48,900

What's going on in here?

441

昨晚通宵鉴定卡特怀特的尸体”
Up all night identifying Cartwright's body."

446
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:05,250
一定是玩笑 拜托 什么 在哪 怎么回事
It's got to be a windup. Come on. What? Where? What?

447
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:06,330
他一定在笑呢
He must be having a laugh.

448
00:34:06,330 --> 00:34:09,130

486

我加了 只不过不是你想要的那种
I did, just not the kind you were hoping for.

打算邀请我进来吗 不打算
Gonna invite me in? No.

488
00:36:58,170 --> 00:36:59,920

就不能来看看老朋友
Can't drop in on an old friend?

496
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:31,960
不太可能 这么说也不对

洗手间里
In the bathroom.

506
00:38:04,610 --> 00:38:06,370
跟当年一样 是吧
Just like old times, eh?

507
00:38:06,370 --> 00:38:09,410
你打算告诉其他人吗
And will you tell the others?

508
00:38:09,410 --> 00:38:10,830
我给何发了条短信
Well, I sent a text to Ho.

509
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:13,620
我想他现在应该已经告诉大家了
I expect he'd have spread the word around by now.

510
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:15,040
你发了条短信
You sent a text?

511
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:16,920
我可没打算发推文
Well, I wasn't gonna tweet it.

512
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:19,040
老天 斯坦迪什 人命关天啊
Jesus Christ, Standish, a man died.

513
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,510

You know what this news will do to Louisa?

514
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:24,380
所以我才发给何 我很讲究策略的
That's why I sent it to Ho. I know how to be tactful.

515
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:31,680
那么 既然你已经告诉我 这个坏消息了 你可以走了
So-Well, now that you've told me this terrible news, y-feel free to leave.

516
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:36,560
能看出来 你很忙
I can see you're busy.

517
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:44,820
你就不问问是谁的洗手间吗 谁的
Aren't you gonna ask whose bathroom? Whose bathroom?

518
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:47,490
抱歉 只能告诉需要知道的人
Sorry, need-to-know.

519
00:38:47,490 --> 00:38:48,740
你很开心吧
You're enjoying this.

520
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:51,700
能喝杯水就更开心了
Well, I'd enjoy it more with a glass of water.

521
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:54,540
你知道通宵不睡的人有多缺水
You know how dehydrated you get after an all-nighter.

522
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,290
老天
For God's sake.

523
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:11,510
你一个人住
Are you alone?

524
00:39:12,470 --> 00:39:14,220
对 我该先问问的
Yeah, I should have asked.

525
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:16,270
我看起来像有伴的样子
Do I look like I have company?

526
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:18,730
好吧 我必须问的
Yeah. Well, I had to ask, you know.

527
00:39:18,730 --> 00:39:22,820
有些污名可不好洗刷 你应该知道
It's hard to shake off a reputation. Well, you should know.

528
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:25,820
你认识的每一个人都认为你是个大混蛋
I mean, everyone you've ever met has pegged you as an utter bastard.

529
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:29,360
但我不用受你气了 因为我辞职了 记得吗
But I don't have to put up with you anymore because I quit. Remember?

530
00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:34,290
至少我尝试辞职了 我给人事部写了三封同样的信
Well, I tried to. I've written the same letter to HR three times.

531
00:39:34,290 --> 00:39:36,500
是 我知道 他们总把信转发给我
Yeah, I know. They keep forwarding it to me.

532
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:38,790
文件总得有人批嘛
Something about ratifying the paperwork.

533
00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:41,130
老天 兰姆 问题到底出在哪
For God's sake, Lamb. What's the problem?

534
00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:44,840
你多年来一直刺激我 然后我终于做了让你如愿以偿的事
I mean, you spent years goading me, and then I finally did what you wanted.

535
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:48,180
在该死的辞职信上签字啊 让我继续过我的人生
Just sign the damn papers, and let me get on with my life.

536
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:50,550
我想确保你了解自己的心意
I wanna make sure you know your own mind.

537
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:52,600
对 想像一下
Right, imagine how I'd feel

538
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,850
如果你后悔不已 酒瘾复发 我该有多难受
if you wound up full of regret and had a relapse.

539
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:56,430
我可不想背负这种良心债
I wouldn't want that on my conscience,

540
00:39:56,430 --> 00:39:59,350
你会整天以泪洗面 借酒消愁
you getting all weepy and hitting the bottle.

541
00:39:59,350 --> 00:40:02,190
人们说酒鬼都在找借口
Now, they say drunks are just looking for an excuse.

542
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:04,110
我不怪你 这是一种病
I'm not blaming you, it's a disease.

543
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:06,070
对了 是他爷爷的
It was his grandfather's, by the way.

544
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:07,820
什么
What?

545
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:13,410
他爷爷的洗手间 不是因为你问我才说的
His grandfather's bathroom, not that you asked.

546
00:40:13,410 --> 00:40:15,330
你也没问是谁
You also didn't ask who.

547
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:18,960
什么谁 谁枪杀了瑞弗
Who what? Who shot River.

548
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:21,040
因为你和我一样 知道他还活着
Because, like me, you know he's alive.

549
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,420
别耍花样了
So stop playing games.

550
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:27,010
你刚刚告诉我说 你确认是他的尸体
You've just told me you'd identified his body.

551
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:30,880
是啊 你对当时的情况表现得非常不在意
Yeah, and you were remarkably incurious about the circumstances.

552
00:40:31,550 --> 00:40:33,180
我惊呆了 好吗
I'm in shock, okay.

553
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:36,390
你惊讶的是我来了 而不是
You're in shock at me being here, but you're not in shock

554
00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:39,140
瑞弗还活着 因为你见过他
at the idea of River being alive because you've seen him.

555
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:40,690
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

556
00:40:40,690 --> 00:40:42,020
一派胡言 才不是
That's absolute rubbish. No, don't.

557
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:43,440
拜托 斯坦迪什 不
Please, Standish. No--

558
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,520
你很不擅长这一套
You're no good at this.

559
00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:48,150
再说了
And besides...

560
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:51,610
他的车就停在外面
his car's outside.

561
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:59,910
是的 好吧 他来过
Yes. Okay. He was here,

562
00:40:59,910 --> 00:41:02,620
但现在不在这里了 好 这还差不多
but he's not here anymore. All right, that's better.

563
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:05,500
好了 请别装了
Now, please don't pretend

564
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:08,460
你一定把那个老混蛋藏在卧室了
you haven't got the old bastard stashed away in the bedroom.

565
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:10,550
杰克逊 瑞弗叫我保护他
Jackson. River asked me to protect him.

566
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:15,220
满意了
Happy now?

567
00:41:16,470 --> 00:41:18,180
你是了解我的
You know me.

568
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:20,850
知道我什么时候不是满心欢喜
When am I not full of joie de fucking vivre.

569
00:41:20,850 --> 00:41:22,940
很好 你现在就从我的卧室里出去吧
Good. Well, perhaps you could leave my bedroom now.

570
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:24,020
嘿
Hey!

571
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:26,940
哥们
Mate.

572
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:32,200
瑞弗在哪
Where's River?

573
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:50,380
(巴黎德士)

574
00:41:52,090 --> 00:41:53,340
你到底是谁
Who the hell are you?

575
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:57,680
还有多久到
How much longer?

576
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,520
没多远了
We aren't far now.

577
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:38,780
