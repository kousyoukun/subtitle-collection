00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:52,613
Yeah. Yeah.

20
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:56,033
All right, who are you, huh?

21
00:01:56,033 --> 00:01:57,743
What am I doing here?

22
00:01:57,743 --> 00:01:59,912
And why did you hit me in the head?

23
00:01:59,912 --> 00:02:01,747
Did we need that? Hmm?

24
00:02:03,916 --> 00:02:05,709
Uh... Uh...

00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:07,377
[in French] Who are you? Hmm?

What are you doing?

27
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:13,509
Are you French?

28
00:02:13,509 --> 00:02:15,636
[in English]
Someone is coming to talk to you.

29

Who is? Who's coming to talk to me?

- [inhales sharply, clicks tongue]
- Fuck. Okay. Yeah.

Huh? Did you take my phone?

33
00:02:29,233 --> 00:02:30,442
Did you... Wait, wait!

34
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:35,656
Can you... [grunts] Fucking.

["Strange Game" playing]

[Catherine] David, uh,
here's another cup of tea.

40
00:03:41,013 --> 00:03:42,931
Well, I hope this one's strong enough.

41
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,853
Charles used to like his tea so weak
I used to say,

42
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:50,814
"Do you want some tea with your milk?"

43
00:03:52,274 --> 00:03:53,692
Do you remember Charles?

David?

45
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:58,405
I killed him.

46
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:01,074
- River.
- No.

47
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:04,620
No, that was someone
who looked like him. Remember?

48
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:08,207
Someone who looked like him?

49
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:12,211
Dear God, what have I done?

50
00:04:12,211 --> 00:04:14,755
Uh, David, that was self-defense.

51
00:04:16,882 --> 00:04:21,011
No, I... [sighs, pants] I did it for River.

52
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:24,890
[breathes shakily] To protect him.
To protect River.

Where is he?

00:04:29,061 --> 00:04:32,773
Hmm? Where's my boy?

55
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:35,526
[breathes shakily]
Why did he leave me here?

- [panting]
- David?

00:04:39,321 --> 00:04:40,322
Who are you?

58
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:42,658
Oh, I'm Catherine Standish.

59
00:04:42,658 --> 00:04:44,535
I used to work with River.

60
00:04:44,535 --> 00:04:47,579
And, uh, before that,
I worked for Charles Partner.

61
00:04:48,539 --> 00:04:50,499
No. No, I don't remember you.

62
00:04:50,499 --> 00:04:51,583
Oh.

63
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:53,710
You knew Charles, you say?

64
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,712
- Yes, I was his PA.
- I...

65
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:57,965
And then I was Jackson's PA.

66
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:00,884
The bomb.

67
00:05:02,261 --> 00:05:03,470
All those people.

68
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:07,307
- All those poor people.
- No, David. The bomb wasn't you.

[knocks on door]

70
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:10,018
David.

71
00:05:13,772 --> 00:05:15,899
- Oh.
- [pants] I must speak to First Desk.

72
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:17,025
You can't go to the Park.

73
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:18,569
- River doesn't want that.
- No, no, no.

74
00:05:18,569 --> 00:05:19,862
- Get your hands off me.
- No, David.

75
00:05:19,862 --> 00:05:22,155
- Don't touch me!
- I'm sorry.

76
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:23,991
I have to talk to First Desk.

77
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:26,159
I have to tell them what happened.

78
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:28,495
- [pants] What's coming.
- What's coming?

79
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:29,580
What happened?

80
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:31,582
The bomb.

81
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:33,250
River.

82
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:37,880
I have... [stammers]
Why am I talking to you?

83
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:39,673
I remember you.

84
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:42,426
- You're just a bloody secretary.
- [scoffs]

85
00:05:42,426 --> 00:05:44,970
- Get me First Desk.
- David. David, listen.

86
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:47,472
Listen, First Desk is very busy. Yes?

87
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:49,266
- I mean, you know what it's like.
- No, no, no.

88
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:52,144
They'll talk to me. They'll talk to me.
I used to run the damn place.

89
00:05:52,144 --> 00:05:53,520
I know you did.

90
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:58,650
But at this time of day, he'll be
reading the cables from Berlin, won't he?

91
00:05:59,234 --> 00:06:04,198
Berlin? Oh, yes. Yes, of course.
That... [chuckles]

92
00:06:04,198 --> 00:06:05,324
- And he...
- The schedule.

93
00:06:05,324 --> 00:06:07,618
That's right.
And he's got to get that right.

94
00:06:07,618 --> 00:06:09,995
I mean, agents in play,
awaiting instructions.

95
00:06:09,995 --> 00:06:11,163
We can't interrupt that.

96
00:06:11,163 --> 00:06:12,956
No, no. It's very dangerous.

97
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:17,544
So, if you will allow me,
I will call the Park right now,

98
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:20,797
and I will get you the first
available appointment after that.

99
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:21,715
You can do that?

100
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:24,218
[scoffs] I'm a secretary.
That's what I do.

101
00:06:24,218 --> 00:06:26,053
- [chuckles] Here, sit.
- [chuckles]

102
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,721
Okay.

103
00:06:28,472 --> 00:06:30,641
- Oh. Yeah. [chuckles]
- Here's your tea.

104
00:06:30,641 --> 00:06:31,934
Thank you.

105
00:06:31,934 --> 00:06:33,143
I'll be back in a minute.

106
00:06:33,143 --> 00:06:34,728
- It's very kind of you.
- You're welcome.

107
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:37,940
I... I need to speak to First Desk.

108
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,024
Yes.

109
00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:47,824
- [crockery clattering]
- It's my fault.

110
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:49,743
[sniffs]

111
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:52,454
It's all my fault.

[panting]

114
00:07:25,237 --> 00:07:26,738
Who's upstairs?

115
00:07:27,281 --> 00:07:28,907
The usual bunch of dead weights.

116
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:32,327
Shit rises to the top in this building
with the gold at the bottom.

117
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:35,205
Although, you have the top office,
so I'll take that back.

118
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:37,583
Listen, you tit, in the last hour,

119
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:41,378
someone walked up those stairs
in shoes that are outside your salary.

120
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:42,379
Who?

121
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:44,047
Well, it's not my fault.

122
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:45,674
I didn't know who she was.

123
00:07:46,592 --> 00:07:47,676
Oh.

124
00:07:47,676 --> 00:07:50,304
And if I'd had known,
I couldn't have stopped her.

125
00:07:50,304 --> 00:07:52,639
[footsteps departing]

126
00:07:58,395 --> 00:08:00,230
[Jackson] Were you here when she came in?

127
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:02,357
No, that's not my fault.

128
00:08:03,275 --> 00:08:04,902
Is River headed to Lavande?

129
00:08:04,902 --> 00:08:07,988
[sighs] Go to Catherine's,
get her to move David Cartwright.

130
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:09,948
David's with Catherine?

131
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:14,578
- What about River?
- [footsteps departing]

132
00:08:22,586 --> 00:08:24,129
Well, this wasn't in the diary.

133
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:26,715
[sighs] Lucky I have a free slot.

134
00:08:26,715 --> 00:08:29,801
Has anyone offered you tea or coffee?

135
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:31,845
- No.
- Yeah, well, it's just as well.

136
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:34,515
I think there's
something dead in the water tank.

137
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:37,476
[sighs] So, how can I help?

138
00:08:37,476 --> 00:08:38,559
I think you know why I'm here.

139
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:43,649
[stammers] You've not been relegated
to Slough House already, have you?

140
00:08:43,649 --> 00:08:46,276
What the fuck did you do?
Get caught drinking on the job?

141
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:47,778
You can drop the act.

142
00:08:47,778 --> 00:08:49,613
I know you're
not the shambling fool you appear.

143
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:52,074
Blood work come back, has it?

144
00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:54,243
Well, what can I say?

145
00:08:54,243 --> 00:08:56,411
[mumbles] He's my joe.

146
00:08:56,411 --> 00:08:58,539
He-He-He wanted
everyone to think he was dead,

147
00:08:58,539 --> 00:09:00,749
and I helped keep it that way
for as long as I could.

148
00:09:00,749 --> 00:09:04,169
He might be your joe, but he's MI5's agent
and he was present at a murder scene.

149
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:06,505
Maybe he even pulled the trigger.
I'm bringing him in.

150
00:09:06,505 --> 00:09:07,923
Uh, well, be my guest.

151
00:09:07,923 --> 00:09:09,550
I don't know where the fuck he is.

152
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:11,176
So, you can put the thumbscrews on me,

153
00:09:11,176 --> 00:09:13,053
'cause that's the only
answer you're gonna get.

154
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:15,222
I'm taking you in for
obstructing an investigation. Get up.

155
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:16,682
Nah, I'm good here, thanks.

156
00:09:16,682 --> 00:09:19,226
[smacks lips] I got a full day
of fuck all to get through.

157
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:20,978
Well, the carload of Dogs
I'm about to call

158
00:09:20,978 --> 00:09:22,396
might get in the way of that.

159
00:09:23,772 --> 00:09:26,733
[sighs] Well, I wouldn't
want people to think

160
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:29,611
they had to send a bunch of men
to do a woman's job.

161
00:09:30,988 --> 00:09:33,824
Now, uh, cuffs won't be necessary.
Come on.

162
00:09:33,824 --> 00:09:38,245
I'd rather not take any chances with a man
who looks like he gropes people on buses.

163
00:09:40,831 --> 00:09:43,125
You're being hurtful about my appearance.

164
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:45,377
I might have to call HR.

165
00:09:50,674 --> 00:09:52,634
Look, I get why you're angry.

166
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:58,140
[sighs] You would have told Taverner
that River was dead,

167
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:01,518
and she did a little jig
and now you gotta go back and tell her

168
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:03,812
that the most troublesome agent
is alive and well

169
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:05,772
and in the wind doing fuck knows what.

170
00:10:06,648 --> 00:10:11,403
So, by way of amends,
I'm happy to give you David Cartwright.

171
00:10:11,403 --> 00:10:12,738
Why would you do that?

172
00:10:13,322 --> 00:10:16,658
[panting] Because going to the Park
is like being in IKEA.

173
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:18,911
You can never get
out of the fucking place.

174
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:20,913
Go on then.

175
00:10:20,913 --> 00:10:21,997
[sighs]

176
00:10:23,707 --> 00:10:25,667
[scoffs] Do I look like an idiot?

177
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:32,591
[pants] You know, talking about your looks
could get me into all sorts of trouble.

178
00:10:32,591 --> 00:10:35,385
You'd burn David Cartwright to avoid
being taken in yourself?

179
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:38,180
[sighs] River's my joe.
But Cartwright's a piece of shit.

180
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:42,976
The idea of him sitting in a basement cell
stirs my nethers.

181
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:45,187
Where is he?

182
00:10:45,187 --> 00:10:47,481
[panting]

183
00:10:51,235 --> 00:10:52,444
[Flyte sighs]

184
00:10:52,444 --> 00:10:54,696
[Roddy breathes heavily, grunting]

185
00:10:59,743 --> 00:11:01,370
- [footsteps approach]
- Hey.

186
00:11:03,664 --> 00:11:04,957
Hey, apologies.

187
00:11:04,957 --> 00:11:06,083
What for?

188
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:08,460
Well, I didn't realize you were a Dog.

189
00:11:09,336 --> 00:11:11,922
Uh, I mean, obviously you're not a dog.

190
00:11:13,257 --> 00:11:14,758
Where did you park your wings?

191
00:11:15,843 --> 00:11:17,219
Meaning you're an angel.

192
00:11:18,387 --> 00:11:23,725
In case you thought I was implying you
were a seagull or a... a crow.

193
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:28,313
But with those legs,
you're more of a flamingo, aren't ya?

194
00:11:29,648 --> 00:11:31,066
[chuckles]

195
00:11:33,402 --> 00:11:34,236
[click]

196
00:11:36,113 --> 00:11:37,114
Hey!

197
00:11:40,742 --> 00:11:43,370
Well, I've actually got
a girlfriend anyway, so you lose.

198
00:11:43,871 --> 00:11:46,164
I can just slip this off, so...

199
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:49,543
double lose.

200
00:11:49,543 --> 00:11:52,421
[grunts, panting]

201
00:11:53,755 --> 00:11:54,756
- Hi.
- [agent] Hi.

202
00:12:00,179 --> 00:12:01,180
[Claude clears throat]

203
00:12:03,807 --> 00:12:06,310
- Giti? Is... Is it Giti?
- Uh...

204
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:07,936
- Is it Giti? It is.
- ...yeah. [chuckles]

205
00:12:07,936 --> 00:12:09,563
No, no, please, please. Please, sit down.

206
00:12:09,563 --> 00:12:11,607
- Sit down. No hierarchy here.
- Uh.

207
00:12:11,607 --> 00:12:13,317
[chuckles] All is one, I like to think...

208
00:12:13,317 --> 00:12:15,194
- [sighs]
- [clears throat] ...to myself.

209
00:12:15,194 --> 00:12:19,156
Um... Uh, it's just, uh, Diana Taverner
commended you to me for your...

210
00:12:19,156 --> 00:12:21,366
The work you did on the cold body case.

211
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:23,202
And I wanted to say thank you very much.

212
00:12:23,202 --> 00:12:26,496
Thank you. [inhales sharply]
Such a relief it was a glitch.

213
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:28,874
Yes. Yes, it was. Yeah.

214
00:12:28,874 --> 00:12:30,709
Gave us all
a bit of a scare though for a minute.

215
00:12:30,709 --> 00:12:32,920
Oh, I didn't mean to
cause any unnecessary panic.

216
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,630
Oh, no, no. Totally necessary.

217
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:37,841
I mean,
we've got to explore every possibility.

218
00:12:37,841 --> 00:12:40,594
And in fact, that actually got me
to thinking, because, um,

219
00:12:40,594 --> 00:12:43,764
I thought it would be a very good idea
to double-check the archives

220
00:12:43,764 --> 00:12:46,725
for any other glitches, you know.

221
00:12:46,725 --> 00:12:50,604
Anomalies in the, uh, cold body program.

222
00:12:50,604 --> 00:12:52,064
Uh, okay.

223
00:12:52,064 --> 00:12:54,816
[stammers]
I-I did actually suggest that to her.

224
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,027
- Second Desk.
- Did you?

225
00:12:57,027 --> 00:13:00,364
Mm-hmm. And she said I'd be
better placed on current duties.

226
00:13:00,364 --> 00:13:01,448
- Did she? Yeah.
- Mmm.

227
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:05,077
Well, she's absolutely right, of course.
From her perspective. [clears throat]

228
00:13:05,077 --> 00:13:07,663
I mean, she's running...
She's running live ops, isn't she?

229
00:13:07,663 --> 00:13:11,500
And with Westacres ongoing, she doesn't...
She doesn't have the bandwidth

230
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:15,963
for this kind of, what should we say,
uh, speculative investigation.

231
00:13:16,755 --> 00:13:21,468
But I do and I would like you
to report direct to me.

232
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:23,720
I'd love to.

233
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:26,932
- Uh, love is probably the wrong word.
- Yeah, probably.

234
00:13:26,932 --> 00:13:29,101
- It will be okay with her, won't it?
- Yeah, that's a bit...

235
00:13:29,101 --> 00:13:30,936
Uh, I don't want to get in any trouble.

236
00:13:30,936 --> 00:13:33,564
No, no, no, keep this between ourselves,
I think.

237
00:13:33,564 --> 00:13:36,149
Uh, discretion being
the better part of valor.

238
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:39,069
And you'll be getting us ahead
of any potential trouble,

239
00:13:39,069 --> 00:13:41,196
which would be a big help in fact.

240
00:13:41,196 --> 00:13:45,659
Uh, so if there's anything
that I can do to facilitate that,

241
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:48,120
uh, please... please do tell me.

242
00:13:50,831 --> 00:13:51,915
Please, after you.

243
00:13:51,915 --> 00:13:54,084
- H-Have you been in here before?
- I haven't.

244
00:13:54,084 --> 00:13:55,752
- Oh, have you met Molly?
- No.

245
00:13:55,752 --> 00:13:59,840
Oh, a lot of fun. A lot of fun.
[chuckles] Uh...

246
00:14:02,134 --> 00:14:03,218
Oh.

247
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:05,512
Oh, hello, Molly.

248
00:14:05,512 --> 00:14:07,097
[clicks tongue] Hello, Weasel.

249
00:14:07,097 --> 00:14:09,433
[laughing]

250
00:14:09,433 --> 00:14:12,060
Uh, Weasel's a term they use
to refer to those of us

251
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:15,564
that use gaming programs
to refine long-term strategy.

252
00:14:15,564 --> 00:14:17,441
That's... That's actually what that means.

253
00:14:17,441 --> 00:14:20,235
You'll always be a Weasel to me.

254
00:14:21,028 --> 00:14:23,030
Yeah, Molly, I'm First Desk, all right?
[mumbles]

255
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:25,199
Not appropriate, is it?

256
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:28,035
- So... [clears throat] ...cold bodies?
- Yes.

257
00:14:28,035 --> 00:14:31,538
Yes, Giti here thinks that she may
have found one connected to Westacres.

258
00:14:32,497 --> 00:14:36,210
So, what I'd like her to do is to
double-check that there aren't

259
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:41,423
any of our old cold bodies
out there in the world being used.

260
00:14:41,423 --> 00:14:42,674
You understand?

261
00:14:43,217 --> 00:14:46,637
If you wouldn't mind
affording her the run of this place,

262
00:14:46,637 --> 00:14:50,849
facilitating in any way that you can,
I'd appreciate that.

263
00:14:53,018 --> 00:14:55,395
Uh, thank you.

264
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:57,397
Thank you so much, Giti. Thank you.

265
00:14:59,525 --> 00:15:03,195
I've had enough of games
between First and Second Desk.

266
00:15:04,029 --> 00:15:06,365
Yeah, me too. Well, it's funny.

267
00:15:06,365 --> 00:15:09,868
It's funny, because, um, who-who-who
do you think comes first in that?

268
00:15:09,868 --> 00:15:14,748
You know, when I say First Desk and
then I say Second Desk, who do you think...

269
00:15:14,748 --> 00:15:16,333
Diana Taverner.

270
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:28,762

00:16:08,802 --> 00:16:10,429
[door unlocks]

280
00:16:17,936 --> 00:16:18,937
Who are you?

281
00:16:19,605 --> 00:16:21,356
Are you the person
who's been wanting to talk to me?

282
00:16:21,356 --> 00:16:23,984
We're the ones with the gun.
So, we ask the questions here.

283
00:16:24,943 --> 00:16:26,278
Okay.

284
00:16:26,278 --> 00:16:28,697
[Natasha] You look like
someone from Les Arbres.

285
00:16:28,697 --> 00:16:32,284
You have a passport with his photo in,
and you're not him.

286
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:34,703
What were you doing there?

287
00:16:34,703 --> 00:16:37,247
I'm guessing from the fact
that he keeps pointing that at me

288
00:16:37,247 --> 00:16:39,750
that you didn't like this guy very much.

289
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,460
So, maybe
he'll put it down when I tell you

290
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:44,087
that he can't hurt anyone anymore
because he's dead.

291
00:16:50,511 --> 00:16:52,054
Why is he not putting the gun down?

292
00:16:54,723 --> 00:16:56,016
He was my son.

293
00:16:59,186 --> 00:17:00,479
How did he die?

294
00:17:02,314 --> 00:17:05,108
He turned up at my grandfather's
pretending to be me

295
00:17:05,901 --> 00:17:08,028
because he was going
to drown him in a bath.

296
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:10,239
But then my grandfather shot him.

297
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,415
[in French] It was bound to end that way.

298
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:23,794
With a father like that.

299
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:27,673
- [in English] Look, right.
- [gun cocks]

300
00:17:30,008 --> 00:17:32,386
I'm MI5. Okay?

301
00:17:34,388 --> 00:17:36,223
The British security service.

302
00:17:36,223 --> 00:17:37,474
We don't care.

303
00:17:38,475 --> 00:17:39,685
You... Just go.

304
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:42,437
[stammers]

305
00:17:47,985 --> 00:17:49,236
Yes.

306
00:17:55,742 --> 00:17:56,577
Look, look.

307
00:17:56,577 --> 00:18:00,747
I-I-I... I'm sorry about your son,
but I-I need to know who he was.

308
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:03,125
You've been asking to leave, now leave.

309
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:04,918
You really need to stop
pointing that at me.

310
00:18:04,918 --> 00:18:07,087
- [mob speaking French]
- Okay? [stammers]

311
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,047
[stammers] Wh-Who are they?

312
00:18:10,132 --> 00:18:11,216
They think you are Bertrand.

313
00:18:11,216 --> 00:18:14,178
Right. But I'm not Bertrand, am I?
Can you tell them that?

314
00:18:14,178 --> 00:18:17,181
- Tell them yourself.
- I'm... All right, look.

315
00:18:17,181 --> 00:18:18,348
Listen to me, all right?

316
00:18:19,433 --> 00:18:21,643
You see this? You see this man?

317
00:18:21,643 --> 00:18:23,604
The one next to your son?

318
00:18:24,396 --> 00:18:26,648
- [Natasha] Yeah.
- He was at Les Arbres too, right?

319
00:18:26,648 --> 00:18:27,983
- Yeah?
- [Natasha] Yeah.

320
00:18:27,983 --> 00:18:30,068
Well, you know the bomb in London?
The one at the shops?

321
00:18:30,068 --> 00:18:31,320
That was him.

322
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,071
He set that off.

323
00:18:35,115 --> 00:18:36,617
And that could happen again.

324
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:40,621
So, you need to tell me
who these people are

325
00:18:40,621 --> 00:18:42,039
and where I can find them.

326
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,963
Catherine, it's Louisa. Again.

327
00:18:50,756 --> 00:18:54,051
Emma Flyte, new head Dog,
is on her way to you.

328
00:18:54,051 --> 00:18:56,970
She's after David Cartwright.
You need to get him out before she...

329
00:18:58,931 --> 00:18:59,932
Oh, shit.

330
00:19:01,141 --> 00:19:02,309
[sighs]

331
00:19:04,603 --> 00:19:07,564
[panting] Excuse me?

332
00:19:08,273 --> 00:19:10,108
Excuse me? Hi.

333
00:19:10,108 --> 00:19:13,904
[panting] I'm rea... I'm really sorry,
but I think someone's following me.

334
00:19:13,904 --> 00:19:17,449
Do... Do you think... Do you think you could
just walk with me to the end of the road?

335
00:19:17,449 --> 00:19:19,660
- [panting]
- Um, I-I can't see anyone.

336
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:22,037
Oh. They're... They're probably hiding.

337
00:19:22,037 --> 00:19:24,623
I just... I was in the shop earlier
and I came back out,

338
00:19:24,623 --> 00:19:27,292
and I thought he had disappeared,
but then he was right behind me again.

339
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:28,794
Not him, is it?

340
00:19:30,754 --> 00:19:32,798
No, no, no, no.
This guy is just... He's much younger.

341
00:19:32,798 --> 00:19:35,050
He's got really scary eyes,
and he's just really dangerous.

342
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:37,511
Okay. Well, you're in luck,
'cause I'm with the security services.

343
00:19:37,511 --> 00:19:38,804
Oh, thank God. Can we walk?

344
00:19:38,804 --> 00:19:41,431
- [Flyte] My colleague will deal with it.
- Oh, okay.

345
00:19:41,431 --> 00:19:42,808
- Great. Thank you.
- Okay.

346
00:19:44,643 --> 00:19:47,312
- Is everything all right?
- Yeah. Uh, yeah,

347
00:19:47,312 --> 00:19:49,731
I was just, um,
speaking to your colleague.

348
00:19:49,731 --> 00:19:51,859
Uh... I thought someone was following me,
but they're not.

349
00:19:51,859 --> 00:19:53,026
- So, it's all...
- You sure?

350
00:19:53,026 --> 00:19:55,320
- Yeah. Thank you. Fuck's sake.
- Uh, you look familiar.

351
00:19:57,239 --> 00:20:00,075
Wow. Vulnerable woman
and you're trying it on?

352
00:20:00,075 --> 00:20:02,619
No. God, no. No.
I just feel like we've met. That is all.

353
00:20:02,619 --> 00:20:04,788
Right. You just stop right there
before I report you.

354
00:20:04,788 --> 00:20:06,081
- Okay?
- Yeah.

355
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:09,626
So now you're following me?

356
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:11,211
[scoffs]

357
00:20:12,713 --> 00:20:14,256
Just tryna help, man.

358
00:20:15,465 --> 00:20:18,385
- [doorbell rings]
- [door opens]

359
00:20:19,678 --> 00:20:21,555
Emma Flyte. Head of security for the Park.

360
00:20:21,555 --> 00:20:24,266
- [chattering on radio]
- Can I see some ID, please?

361
00:20:29,396 --> 00:20:31,023
[latch unlocks]

362
00:20:32,274 --> 00:20:34,067
- How can I help?
- You can let me inside.

363
00:20:35,027 --> 00:20:36,069
Do you have a warrant?

364
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:37,863
You're still a member of the service,

365
00:20:37,863 --> 00:20:39,865
which means
you're subject to my jurisdiction.

366
00:20:39,865 --> 00:20:41,658
Which means I don't need a warrant.

367
00:20:41,658 --> 00:20:44,161
Except I resigned a while ago.

368
00:20:44,161 --> 00:20:46,121
Hmm. Yes. Not exactly.

369
00:20:46,121 --> 00:20:49,458
You handed in your resignation,
but the paperwork seems to have stalled.

370
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:51,460
Remind me,
are you still receiving a salary?

371
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:53,086
Receiving, not spending.

372
00:20:53,086 --> 00:20:56,089
Doesn't matter.
You're on the books, so open up.

373
00:21:05,807 --> 00:21:06,642
[sighs]

374
00:21:06,642 --> 00:21:09,770
[radio host] <i>...updates on the progress
of the Westacres investigation</i>

375
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:11,355
<i>is the Deputy Commissioner...</i>

376
00:21:11,355 --> 00:21:13,440
[Flyte] Still keeping a hand in, I see.

377
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,817
I'm allowed to keep up with the news.

378
00:21:15,817 --> 00:21:17,736
- Nice flat.
- Thank you.

379
00:21:17,736 --> 00:21:18,987
Quiet area too.

380
00:21:19,821 --> 00:21:21,406
And you're a reader.

381
00:21:21,406 --> 00:21:24,368
Nothing spoils a good book
faster than a lot of background noise.

382
00:21:24,368 --> 00:21:26,370
Unless it's unwelcome visitors.

383
00:21:27,996 --> 00:21:31,250
- Talking of visitors, where is he?
- Who?

384
00:21:32,709 --> 00:21:34,127
David Cartwright.

385
00:21:34,127 --> 00:21:38,090
Dav... I haven't seen
David Cartwright in over 20 years, so...

386
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:39,800
Please don't go in there.

387
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,969
Uh, why would he... Oh.

388
00:21:43,637 --> 00:21:46,181
I asked you not to come in here.

389
00:21:46,181 --> 00:21:48,350
I don't like strangers in my bedroom.

390
00:21:49,351 --> 00:21:51,228
Excuse me. [sighs]

391
00:21:52,396 --> 00:21:55,315
I'm sorry, but are we in some sort of
West End farce?

392
00:21:55,315 --> 00:21:57,401
- [sighs]
- Oh, for God's sake.

393
00:21:57,901 --> 00:21:58,861
[clicks tongue, sighs]

394
00:22:04,616 --> 00:22:05,951
Why is this locked?

395
00:22:05,951 --> 00:22:07,327
It's not. It's just stiff.

396
00:22:07,327 --> 00:22:10,831
You have to open it gently
or that happens. See?

397
00:22:11,498 --> 00:22:13,000
I've probably put too much in here.

398
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,085
Look, who told you he was here?

399
00:22:15,085 --> 00:22:16,170
Jackson Lamb.

400
00:22:19,173 --> 00:22:22,009
Oh, well, he'll have sent you here
purely to distress me.

401
00:22:22,009 --> 00:22:23,343
We've had a falling out.

402
00:22:24,052 --> 00:22:26,930
I'm afraid you've been used, Miss Flyte.

403
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:28,307
Just a moment.

404
00:22:29,224 --> 00:22:31,518
Good luck with finding David.

405
00:22:32,561 --> 00:22:36,231
You should try asking his grandson, River,
where he is.

406
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,743
[Marcus] All right. Back in a bit.

407
00:22:48,493 --> 00:22:50,829
You know, it might be an idea
to hold on to that gun.

408
00:22:50,829 --> 00:22:52,247
Everyone's a target.

409
00:22:53,832 --> 00:22:57,127
Post-Westacres, we don't know where
or when the next attack will come.

410
00:22:59,046 --> 00:23:01,381
Put your headphones in,
and shut the fuck up.

411
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:03,800
It's bad karma to sell it.

412
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:06,220
[Marcus] It's bad karma to have
the Christmas decorations still up.

413
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:08,680
Weapons on the street versus
tinsel-based superstition.

414
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,681
Yeah, exactly the same.

415
00:23:09,681 --> 00:23:11,850
Look, I don't want to be doing this,
but I've got no choice.

416
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:13,435
Cassie's already noticing
the unpaid bills.

417
00:23:13,435 --> 00:23:16,522
- It's a fucking nightmare.
- Of your own creation.

418
00:23:17,356 --> 00:23:19,608
- Look, I sort this, and I'm done.
- [phone ringing]

419
00:23:20,734 --> 00:23:22,194
For real this time.

420
00:23:22,194 --> 00:23:23,278
[scoffs]

421
00:23:25,489 --> 00:23:28,534
Hi. Can you come down and help me?

422
00:23:28,534 --> 00:23:30,077
Fuck off.

423
00:23:32,538 --> 00:23:33,664
[sighs]

424
00:23:34,665 --> 00:23:35,791
Ho wants help.

425
00:23:35,791 --> 00:23:38,001
Unless it's with assisting his suicide,
I'm not interested.

426
00:23:38,001 --> 00:23:39,336
[phone ringing]

427
00:23:40,921 --> 00:23:43,131
[Roddy] <i>Look, I'm handcuffed
to my weights machine.</i>

428
00:23:45,676 --> 00:23:46,677
[sighs]

429
00:23:49,513 --> 00:23:51,765
He's handcuffed to his weight machine.
Worth a look.

430
00:23:57,521 --> 00:24:00,190
- [footsteps approaching]
- [grunting]

431
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:01,483
[Shirley chuckles]

432
00:24:01,483 --> 00:24:04,778
Was this an accident
or part of a wanking game?

433
00:24:05,612 --> 00:24:06,613
It was Flyte.

434
00:24:07,239 --> 00:24:08,073
Good on her.

435
00:24:08,073 --> 00:24:10,367
I'm not gonna bother asking why,
'cause I'm sure it was deserved.

436
00:24:10,367 --> 00:24:11,869
Look, are you gonna help me?

437
00:24:11,869 --> 00:24:12,995
No.

438
00:24:13,537 --> 00:24:14,538
[Shirley scoffs]

439
00:24:16,957 --> 00:24:18,375
What are you doing?

440
00:24:19,835 --> 00:24:20,669
[chuckles]

441
00:24:20,669 --> 00:24:23,839
I mean, at least leave him there overnight
or till he shits himself.

442
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:25,007
[JK] I have to help him.

443
00:24:27,634 --> 00:24:29,803
No, you don't. [gasps]

444
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:31,471
[Roddy chuckles]

445
00:24:32,264 --> 00:24:35,184
Do you want to know why
I'm going to free him?

446
00:24:35,726 --> 00:24:38,270
I want to know why
you're holding a knife to my throat.

447
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:40,022
Well, before I was assigned here,

448
00:24:40,022 --> 00:24:44,193
I was handcuffed against my will
and tied to a chair for 72 hours.

449
00:24:44,193 --> 00:24:50,240
- [Shirley sighs]
- So, I find him being cuffed triggering.

450
00:24:52,826 --> 00:24:54,578
Okay. Got it.

451
00:25:02,544 --> 00:25:03,378
[sighs]

452
00:25:04,004 --> 00:25:05,005
[groans]

453
00:25:07,174 --> 00:25:08,175
[Shirley sighs]

454
00:25:12,471 --> 00:25:14,056
What happened while you were handcuffed?

455
00:25:15,015 --> 00:25:18,477
A man threatened to cut open my stomach.

456
00:25:20,521 --> 00:25:21,980
He had an electric...

457
00:25:24,316 --> 00:25:26,151
uh, carving knife.

458
00:25:31,532 --> 00:25:32,616
Badarse.

459
00:25:32,616 --> 00:25:33,742
[JK sighs]

460
00:25:34,701 --> 00:25:35,786
Brothers in cuffs.

461
00:25:39,915 --> 00:25:43,961
I don't like to be touched.

462
00:25:49,258 --> 00:25:50,968
What the fuck.

463
00:25:53,011 --> 00:25:55,013
[chattering indistinctly in French]

464
00:25:56,056 --> 00:25:59,268
[barking]

465
00:26:03,397 --> 00:26:04,648
Victor is my cousin.

466
00:26:05,858 --> 00:26:06,859
Is he?

467
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:08,986
Nice to meet you, Victor.

468
00:26:09,945 --> 00:26:11,697
[Natasha] He was the only one
who stood by me

469
00:26:11,697 --> 00:26:14,241
when I was made pregnant by
the man at Les Arbres.

470
00:26:15,742 --> 00:26:16,827
I was 17.

471
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:19,830
And that's... that's this man?

472
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:22,332
[Natasha] Yes.

473
00:26:23,792 --> 00:26:25,460
Frank Harkness.

474
00:26:26,295 --> 00:26:29,631
Although, he told so many lies,
that may not be his real name.

475
00:26:31,175 --> 00:26:32,676
Well, he never let me see my son.

476
00:26:32,676 --> 00:26:38,682
So, I-I moved away and, um, I would
come back sometimes to see Bertrand,

477
00:26:39,558 --> 00:26:43,228
and he looked through me
like I didn't exist.

478
00:26:44,354 --> 00:26:46,940
We heard everyone at Les Arbres was gone,

479
00:26:48,775 --> 00:26:50,694
and she would never see Bertrand again.

480
00:26:52,029 --> 00:26:53,530
I thought you were him.

481
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:58,410
So, I called her, followed you.

482
00:26:59,203 --> 00:27:01,496
Found Frank trying to kill you.

483
00:27:01,997 --> 00:27:05,250
And then you hit me... [speaks French]

484
00:27:06,793 --> 00:27:09,463
Why would Frank try to kill you?

485
00:27:10,047 --> 00:27:13,717
Well, I think he was destroying evidence,
and I just got in his way.

486
00:27:14,259 --> 00:27:15,886
And the bomber, what about him?

487
00:27:17,137 --> 00:27:19,139
- [Natasha] Yves.
- [River] Yves.

488
00:27:19,139 --> 00:27:22,851
[Natasha] Well, that's no surprise.
The way he was treated as a boy.

489
00:27:22,851 --> 00:27:26,146
You could see his-his hate, his anger.

490
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:30,192
[clicks tongue] So,
you-you-you lived at Les Arbres?

491
00:27:30,943 --> 00:27:32,236
[Natasha] Yeah.

492
00:27:32,236 --> 00:27:33,862
While Bertrand was little.

493
00:27:34,738 --> 00:27:35,948
Did you paint this?

494
00:27:37,241 --> 00:27:38,325
[sighs]

495
00:27:39,326 --> 00:27:42,829
No. [chuckles] One of the other girls did.

496
00:27:43,372 --> 00:27:44,498
Other girls?

497
00:27:45,457 --> 00:27:47,084
Yes. The mothers.

498
00:27:47,084 --> 00:27:49,837
You know, there were some Russians,
a Greek.

499
00:27:49,837 --> 00:27:54,758
Uh, maybe, um, an English
and another local girl, I think.

500
00:27:55,425 --> 00:27:59,721
They have... [stammers] ...his children,
and then he makes the mothers leave

501
00:27:59,721 --> 00:28:01,515
- because that's...
- [dog barking]

502
00:28:01,515 --> 00:28:03,225
...that's how he wants things to be.

503
00:28:05,185 --> 00:28:06,812
- [speaks French]
- [Victor] I'll speak to them.

504
00:28:07,604 --> 00:28:09,648
Tell them you are not
who they think you are.

505
00:28:09,648 --> 00:28:11,275
Yeah, please.

506
00:28:13,819 --> 00:28:16,613
Wow. They really didn't like your son,
did they?

507
00:28:16,613 --> 00:28:20,742
Well, the man out there,
Bertrand put his son in the hospital

508
00:28:20,742 --> 00:28:22,327
and assaulted his daughter.

509
00:28:22,327 --> 00:28:25,122
So, we don't really blame him
for his hate.

510
00:28:26,248 --> 00:28:29,209
- Victor will calm them.
- [Victor speaks French]

511
00:28:29,209 --> 00:28:32,588
- [grunts]
- [clamoring]

512
00:28:32,588 --> 00:28:34,214
- Fuck me. Jesus.
- Run.

513
00:28:39,511 --> 00:28:41,346
[banging on door]

514
00:28:42,222 --> 00:28:44,516
- That's a big dog. [chuckles]
- [mob member grunts]

515
00:28:45,475 --> 00:28:46,935
[mob clamoring]

516
00:28:47,728 --> 00:28:48,687
[Natasha speaks French]

517
00:28:48,687 --> 00:28:50,230
[in French] It's not him!

518
00:28:50,647 --> 00:28:51,940
It's not Bertrand!

519
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:53,233
[exclaims]

520
00:28:53,233 --> 00:28:56,278
- [handler speaks French]
- [dog growling]

521
00:28:56,278 --> 00:28:58,822
- [barking]
- [grunts]

522
00:28:58,822 --> 00:29:00,908
[clamoring continues]

523
00:29:02,576 --> 00:29:03,493
[River] Shit.

524
00:29:03,493 --> 00:29:04,870
[speaks French]

525
00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:07,998
- [grunting]
- [banging on door]

526
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:15,088
- [mob shouts in French]
- [pants]

527
00:29:17,216 --> 00:29:20,219
- [growls, barking]
- [speaking French]

528
00:29:29,186 --> 00:29:30,187
[grunting]

529
00:29:31,355 --> 00:29:32,940
[groaning]

530
00:29:38,445 --> 00:29:39,863
[grunts, breathes sharply]

531
00:29:39,863 --> 00:29:41,949
[panting]

532
00:29:44,284 --> 00:29:46,286
[mob clamoring, shouting]

533
00:29:46,286 --> 00:29:47,871
[dog barking]

534
00:29:53,585 --> 00:29:55,087
[River] Come on.

535
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,966
[clamoring continues]

536
00:30:12,938 --> 00:30:13,939
[exclaims]

537
00:30:14,439 --> 00:30:15,274
Monsieur.

538
00:30:15,274 --> 00:30:16,942
- All right, fuck off!
- [grunting]

539
00:30:17,442 --> 00:30:19,361
[moped revs, stalls]

540
00:30:19,361 --> 00:30:21,154
[River] What the fucking...

541
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:23,156
[moped revs]

542
00:30:28,287 --> 00:30:29,371
Ah!

543
00:30:44,428 --> 00:30:46,430
[footsteps approaching]

544
00:30:52,519 --> 00:30:54,813
- Why aren't you answering your phone?
- [Catherine sighs]

545
00:30:54,813 --> 00:30:58,233
- How have you been, by the way?
- River has it. And I'm fine. Thank you.

546
00:30:59,401 --> 00:31:01,111
Why didn't Lamb just tell me that?

547
00:31:01,111 --> 00:31:02,738
So, Lamb sent you?

548
00:31:02,738 --> 00:31:05,073
Yeah. Where's David?

549
00:31:05,073 --> 00:31:06,783
Oh, luckily I moved him.

550
00:31:06,783 --> 00:31:09,536
It took Lamb all of five minutes
to work out how to find him.

551
00:31:09,536 --> 00:31:10,996
I mean, he's smarter than most,

552
00:31:10,996 --> 00:31:13,457
but he's not the only brain
on Spook Street.

553
00:31:13,457 --> 00:31:17,169
David thinks he's meeting
First Desk in a safe house.

554
00:31:17,169 --> 00:31:18,962
- Where?
- Number 25.

555
00:31:18,962 --> 00:31:21,548
- I'm cat-sitting for my neighbor.
- [sighs]

556
00:31:22,508 --> 00:31:24,510
So, how was River when you saw him?

557
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:27,095
Mmm. He's all right considering.

558
00:31:27,095 --> 00:31:28,347
He's not answering your phone.

559
00:31:28,347 --> 00:31:30,432
He won't do. He's taken out the SIM card.

560
00:31:31,391 --> 00:31:33,060
I'm sorry Lamb told you River was dead.

561
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:34,770
That must have been very hard.

562
00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:36,897
Yeah, it's pretty much the final straw.

563
00:31:37,439 --> 00:31:38,899
I might join you on the outside.

564
00:31:38,899 --> 00:31:41,068
[groans] You'd get very bored.

565
00:31:42,069 --> 00:31:43,654
What's the Westacres news?

566
00:31:44,321 --> 00:31:45,405
Nothing.

567
00:31:45,405 --> 00:31:47,866
Although they're not
ruling out further attacks.

568
00:31:48,575 --> 00:31:50,619
Any idea who tried to kill David?

569
00:31:50,619 --> 00:31:52,204
Just that they came from France.

570
00:31:52,204 --> 00:31:53,288
[meows]

571
00:31:53,956 --> 00:31:56,041
- Oh, hello, Pinkel.
- [meows]

572
00:31:56,041 --> 00:31:58,585
[chuckles] Are you allergic to cats?

573
00:31:59,086 --> 00:32:00,671
No, I just don't really like them.

574
00:32:01,463 --> 00:32:02,798
David?

575
00:32:05,467 --> 00:32:06,468
David?

576
00:32:08,804 --> 00:32:09,888
David?

577
00:32:10,806 --> 00:32:12,057
[Louisa] Catherine!

578
00:32:13,308 --> 00:32:15,143
The back door's open!

579
00:32:16,144 --> 00:32:17,396
Oh, my God.

580
00:32:18,564 --> 00:32:20,566
[both panting]

581
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,408
Oh, fuck.

582
00:32:30,492 --> 00:32:31,827
What am I going to tell River?

583
00:32:31,827 --> 00:32:33,662
What am I gonna tell Lamb? [sighs]

584
00:32:34,496 --> 00:32:37,124
- [bomber on TV] <i>...will I be free.</i>
- [snoring]

585
00:32:37,124 --> 00:32:41,795
<i>You will suffer for the years
I spent imprisoned by your system.</i>

586
00:32:41,795 --> 00:32:44,089
[sirens wailing]

587
00:32:44,089 --> 00:32:46,300
<i>God willing, I will not be the last.</i>

588
00:32:49,511 --> 00:32:51,388
<i>You will hear from my brothers soon.</i>

589
00:32:53,015 --> 00:32:54,516
- [TV host] <i>I'm here on the...</i>
- [knocks]

590
00:32:54,516 --> 00:32:57,060
<i>...just outside of
the Westacres Shopping Center,</i>

591
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:58,312
<i>where the mood is still...</i>

592
00:32:58,312 --> 00:33:01,398
I'm afraid I've got some bad news.
[sniffs]

593
00:33:02,566 --> 00:33:03,859
What the fuck's that?

594
00:33:04,985 --> 00:33:07,487
This? It's just a simple tussie-mussie.

595
00:33:09,239 --> 00:33:10,908
Oh, fuck off.

596
00:33:10,908 --> 00:33:12,576
It's a nosegay.

597
00:33:12,576 --> 00:33:14,870
People used to sniff them
during the great plague

598
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:17,623
- to cancel out the stench of death.
- [sighs]

599
00:33:17,623 --> 00:33:18,916
Fuck off.

600
00:33:20,709 --> 00:33:23,170
I've asked my contacts back at the Park,

601
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:27,549
and there isn't a single shred of evidence
that David Cartwright ever went to France.

602
00:33:28,425 --> 00:33:29,968
So, I suppose our deal is off.

603
00:33:31,428 --> 00:33:33,722
[sighs] I'm afraid so.

604
00:33:33,722 --> 00:33:35,474
Looks like I'm stuck with you.

605
00:33:36,475 --> 00:33:42,189
I did discover that his bagman went there
in the early 90s.

606
00:33:43,649 --> 00:33:44,650
Lavande?

607
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:46,360
Yes.

608
00:33:48,028 --> 00:33:53,158
Go see Ho, and tell him I said
to find out why you're at Slough House.

609
00:33:53,158 --> 00:33:54,409
- Really?
- Well, yeah.

610
00:33:54,409 --> 00:33:55,744
Yeah, I don't want you here.

611
00:33:55,744 --> 00:34:00,832
And letting me know that Bad Sam Chapman
went to France is good enough.

612
00:34:02,709 --> 00:34:04,795
[sniffs, sighs]

613
00:34:08,966 --> 00:34:10,300
[door closes]

614
00:34:20,268 --> 00:34:21,687
[Chapman]
<i>Here you are. Take a closer look.</i>

615
00:34:22,728 --> 00:34:24,231
Sure you haven't seen him?

616
00:34:24,231 --> 00:34:25,732
He lives right across from here.

617
00:34:26,233 --> 00:34:28,193
Thirteen. Looks a bit older.

618
00:34:28,193 --> 00:34:29,862
Goes by the name of KZ.

619
00:34:29,862 --> 00:34:32,281
- Do you mean KayZee? [chuckles]
- [kids laughing]

620
00:34:32,281 --> 00:34:33,489
You know him then?

621
00:34:33,489 --> 00:34:35,701
Depends, is there money in it?

622
00:34:35,701 --> 00:34:36,909
Well, there could be.

623
00:34:37,828 --> 00:34:38,871
How about an advance then?

624
00:34:38,871 --> 00:34:40,621
I don't have any cash on me.

625
00:34:41,665 --> 00:34:45,210
And you know, I don't think
you've got anything to tell me.

626
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:47,170
Well, we can walk you to a cashpoint.

627
00:34:49,464 --> 00:34:52,467
I'm ugly enough I don't mind
getting hit in the face. How about you?

628
00:34:53,092 --> 00:34:55,012
[phone ringing]

629
00:34:55,012 --> 00:34:56,096
[chuckles]

630
00:34:58,432 --> 00:35:01,602
- [kid] Paedo.
- [kids chuckling, clamoring]

631
00:35:01,602 --> 00:35:02,853
[Chapman] <i>Hello, trouble.</i>

632
00:35:03,353 --> 00:35:04,438
I need a meet.

633
00:35:04,438 --> 00:35:06,440
[grunts] Launderette number three.

634
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,901
What if I've got
something more important to do?

635
00:35:08,901 --> 00:35:11,111
- <i>You don't.</i>
- [sighs]

636
00:35:11,737 --> 00:35:13,447
[tail] I have eyes on the old man.

637
00:35:14,865 --> 00:35:16,533
[Frank] <i>Okay, so take him out.</i>

638
00:35:17,117 --> 00:35:18,702
[sighs] He's in public now.

639
00:35:19,203 --> 00:35:23,624
<i>Let him know he's being followed.
He'll get nervous, try and hide.</i>

640
00:35:24,541 --> 00:35:27,127
<i>Kill him out of sight,
then move on to Cartwright.</i>

641
00:35:35,302 --> 00:35:36,386
[Marcus] <i>Dancer Blaine?</i>

642
00:35:37,638 --> 00:35:39,556
Got a bit of merchandise for you.

643
00:35:39,556 --> 00:35:41,517
[Dancer] <i>Who sent you?</i>

644
00:35:41,517 --> 00:35:42,976
No one.

645
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:44,520
<i>How do you know about me?</i>

646
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,522
<i>I'm MI5.</i>

647
00:35:47,231 --> 00:35:48,440
Is this a sting?

648
00:35:49,191 --> 00:35:52,861
<i>Not much of a sting if I tell you
I'm MI5 from the off, right?</i>

649
00:35:54,071 --> 00:35:55,739
Fair point. [inhales sharply]

[sniffs]

655
00:36:30,566 --> 00:36:32,651
Do you know why they call me Dancer?

656
00:36:33,527 --> 00:36:35,112
'Cause you're into ballroom dancing?

657
00:36:36,363 --> 00:36:41,702
And also because I sense danger
and dance right around it.

658
00:36:42,369 --> 00:36:46,999
Now, serving MI5 officer,
well, that screams trouble to me.

659
00:36:48,709 --> 00:36:50,169
Why do you want to sell me a gun?

660
00:36:50,169 --> 00:36:51,962
- I need money, right and fast.
- So, rob a bank.

661
00:36:51,962 --> 00:36:54,256
If you don't want the gun,
fine by me. I'll take it elsewhere.

662
00:36:54,256 --> 00:36:56,592
No, you won't. You need the cash.

663
00:36:56,592 --> 00:36:58,218
That's the other thing
about being a dancer.

664
00:36:58,218 --> 00:37:00,053
You learn to read people.
Anticipate their moves.

665
00:37:00,053 --> 00:37:02,431
- And I can tell you've got a good heart.
- [scoffs]

666
00:37:02,431 --> 00:37:04,391
But you're all out of moves.

Beretta M9.

00:37:14,735 --> 00:37:18,113
Beat out the Sig Sauer P226
to become the primary sidearm

670
00:37:18,113 --> 00:37:21,825
of the US Army from 1985 to present.

671
00:37:25,746 --> 00:37:27,331
- Three grand.
- It's worth five.

672
00:37:27,331 --> 00:37:30,375
Yeah. No, I can sell it for five.
That's how profit works.

673
00:37:32,794 --> 00:37:34,171
[clicks tongue]
All right, four and a half.

674
00:37:34,171 --> 00:37:35,255
Three.

675
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:37,424
- Four.
- Three.

676
00:37:38,175 --> 00:37:39,635
- Three and a half.
- Three.

677

[chuckles, inhales deeply]

678
00:37:47,601 --> 00:37:48,977

- Perfect.

680
00:37:50,979 --> 00:37:54,024

[Chapman] <i>Picked up a tail.</i>

[Jackson] <i>Where are you?</i>

688
00:38:21,593 --> 00:38:23,345
Leading them away from you.

689
00:38:24,137 --> 00:38:27,599
<i>Could be a case I'm working
looking for a 13-year-old.</i>

<i>Runaway.</i>

691
00:38:28,517 --> 00:38:31,186
Got mixed up with the wrong crowd.
Just faced some of them down.

692
00:38:31,186 --> 00:38:33,230
- Could be them.
- <i>Uh, it's not.</i>

693
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:36,692
<i>Someone tried to whack
David Cartwright last night.</i>

Shit. Who?

695
00:38:38,235 --> 00:38:41,363
Uh, I don't know, but the old bastard
blew him away with a shotgun.

696
00:38:41,363 --> 00:38:43,866
- <i>Anyone come looking for you?</i>
- [sighs] Not yet.

697
00:38:44,783 --> 00:38:46,493
I'll head to fallback number two.

Nice of you to call me back.

704
00:39:18,192 --> 00:39:21,278
Lamb called. He needs us as a backup
for a meet with Bad Sam Chapman.

00:39:21,278 --> 00:39:24,114
<i>He said to tail him from the market

[Marcus] Yeah, that's the old garage.

All right, be there soon as.

I thought I saw him, but he's disappeared.

Probably saw me coming and scarpered.
