1
00:00:09,134 --> 00:00:11,154
<i>This is
the pre-boarding announcement</i>

2
00:00:11,178 --> 00:00:15,682
<i>for Lusit Airways flight LLT154
to Marrakech.</i>

3
00:00:15,766 --> 00:00:18,310
<i>We are now inviting
those classified as small children…</i>

4
00:00:18,393 --> 00:00:19,603
Come on. Where are you?

5
00:00:23,774 --> 00:00:27,528
<i>Please have your boarding pass
and identification ready. Thank you.</i>

6
00:00:27,611 --> 00:00:29,988
<i>Less than a minute.</i>

7
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:42,876
- Has there been a handover?
- Negative.

8
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:49,007
Eyes on Dogs.

9
00:00:57,432 --> 00:01:00,352
Why is he airside?
Intel said target was inbound.

10
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:01,895
He made visual contact, ma'am.

11
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:03,105
Reconfirm.

12
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:04,940
Second Desk requests we reconfirm visual.

13
00:01:05,022 --> 00:01:08,694
You're looking for an Asian male,
20s, backpack, blue shirt, white tee.

14
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:12,072
Yes, confirmed,
and I have Dogs on standing by.

15
00:01:17,661 --> 00:01:18,829
Shit.

16
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:21,039
Lost visual. Possible handover.

17
00:01:21,123 --> 00:01:22,643
What does he mean "possible handover"?

18
00:01:22,708 --> 00:01:24,894
- <i>Cartwright, clarify.</i>
- Did you catch anything on CCTV?

19
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:29,173
Negative, that's what you're there for.
Repeat, clarify.

20
00:01:29,256 --> 00:01:30,942
He has a visual.
Did he see a handover or not?

21
00:01:30,966 --> 00:01:32,843
<i>Lost visual momentarily.</i>

22
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:34,720
Repeat, possible handover.

23
00:01:35,304 --> 00:01:37,824
- Come on. Get out of the way.
<i>- Blocked by the cleaner.</i>

24
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:40,392
Lusit Airways
are pleased to announce boarding

25
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:43,437
for flight LLT154 to Marrakech.

26
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,690
We would like to invite families
and those requiring assistance

27
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:48,525
- to come forward first.
- Move, move, move.

28
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:51,236
Please have your passports
and boarding card ready.

29
00:01:52,905 --> 00:01:54,740
Okay, have full visual on target again,

30
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:57,051
but something has definitely gone
in or out of that backpack.

31
00:01:57,075 --> 00:01:58,076
Tell him to hold.

32
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,495
Cartwright, hold your position.
Do not intercept.

33
00:02:02,206 --> 00:02:05,143
- Target is on the move.
<i>- We have eyes on target. Hold.</i>

34
00:02:05,167 --> 00:02:06,168
Ma'am?

35
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:10,797
Hold your position, Cartwright.
Hold your position. We are assessing.

36
00:02:10,881 --> 00:02:13,091
Target is joining the queue to board.
Standing by.

37
00:02:13,175 --> 00:02:14,593
Keep the channel clear, please.

38
00:02:16,345 --> 00:02:17,471
Come on.

39
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:20,307
<i>Second Desk says,
"Do not intercept."</i>

40
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:25,020
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

41
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,817
- Push the button.
- Dogs are standing by, ma'am.

42
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:35,632
At least he's heading downstairs.
There's 300 bodies up there.

43
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:37,866
Yes, but he's headed to
a plane loaded with fuel.

44
00:02:38,534 --> 00:02:40,953
First passengers are
on the tarmac, ma'am.

45
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:47,793
- Authorize.
- Apprehend suspect.

46
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:48,961
Dogs, go.

47
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,548
Move!

48
00:02:54,842 --> 00:02:56,969
- Out of the way!
- Move!

49
00:02:59,096 --> 00:03:00,615
- Down, down, down!
- What the fuck?

50
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:02,516
Get the fuck off me!

51
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:05,352
<i>Disperse if you can. Keep calm.</i>

52
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:07,729
- Get back!
- Get off me!

53
00:03:07,813 --> 00:03:09,541
- What the fuck?
- Relax!

54
00:03:09,565 --> 00:03:11,209
- What are you doing?
- No trigger.

55
00:03:11,233 --> 00:03:12,961
- This is fucking harassment!
- No wires here.

56
00:03:12,985 --> 00:03:14,695
- Clear.
- Bag.

57
00:03:16,071 --> 00:03:17,948
<i>- Get off! Get off me.</i>
<i>- Over.</i>

58
00:03:21,118 --> 00:03:24,621
Somebody film this! Fuck!

59
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:26,957
- Get off me! Nothing on me!
- Stop moving!

60
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:32,629
He's clean.

61
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:35,299
Repeat. Repeat!

62
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:37,861
<i>He's clean.
There's no device, no weapon. Nothing.</i>

63
00:03:37,885 --> 00:03:39,428
- Ma'am?
- He has the wrong suspect,

64
00:03:39,511 --> 00:03:41,656
or we have the wrong intel,
and we don't have the wrong intel.

65
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,974
- Ma'am, he reconfirmed visual.
- Reconfirm again.

66
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:45,809
Cartwright, confirm suspect description.

67
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:49,521
<i>Asian male, 20s, backpack,
blue shirt, white tee.</i>

68
00:03:49,605 --> 00:03:51,106
I said, "white shirt, blue tee."

69
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:53,525
You...

70
00:03:53,609 --> 00:03:56,737
No, no, no, no, you said...
You said, "blue shirt, white tee."

71
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,363
Webb.

72
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:02,367
Shit. Put it on the main screen.

73
00:04:02,451 --> 00:04:04,786
White shirt, blue tee. Suspect is inbound.

74
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:06,914
<i>Inbound, headed to immigration,
main terminal.</i>

75
00:04:06,997 --> 00:04:08,332
Stand Cartwright down. He's done.

76
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:10,709
<i>Second Desk says
stand down, Cartwright.</i>

77
00:04:13,337 --> 00:04:14,630
Oh, shit.

78
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:18,026
- Stand him down.
<i>- Cartwright, where are you going?</i>

79
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:19,903
You tailed the wrong suspect.
You're stood down.

80
00:04:19,927 --> 00:04:21,678
Get me CCTV on that escalator now.

81
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,912
- Should we have immigration hold him up?
- Not with a bomb on his back.

82
00:04:28,936 --> 00:04:30,479
- Get SO15 on standby.
- Ma'am.

83
00:04:30,562 --> 00:04:32,231
SO15, standby.

84
00:04:38,237 --> 00:04:40,089
- He'll be through in two minutes.
- Duffy, where are your Dogs?

85
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:41,591
Still airside with Cartwright's suspect.

86
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:44,117
Jesus Christ!
If you can't get your guys there,

87
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:45,911
get SO15 on the ground now.

88
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:47,555
We got something
behind immigration?

89
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:48,579
Excuse me.

90
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:50,666
Hey! Hey!

91
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:53,686
- How long?
- Three minutes.

92
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:54,878
He's through.

93
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:02,644
<i>There.
He's headed to baggage reclaim.</i>

94
00:05:02,678 --> 00:05:04,888
Stay on him. I need eyes
at the end of that concourse.

95
00:05:04,972 --> 00:05:07,012
- Yep. Coming up now.
- Head to the carousel.

96
00:05:11,562 --> 00:05:13,039
<i>He's Headed to baggage reclaim.</i>

97
00:05:13,063 --> 00:05:14,749
<i>Give me cameras
at the end of baggage reclaim.</i>

98
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:16,191
<i>I want eyes there.</i>

99
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:30,455
Not a Dog in sight.

100
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:31,623
Duffy, those are your guys?

101
00:05:31,707 --> 00:05:33,208
No. No, ma'am. They're en route.

102
00:05:33,292 --> 00:05:35,395
Duffy, surely we've got
transport police on that concourse.

103
00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:37,171
Waiting. Inbound, two minutes.

104
00:05:41,133 --> 00:05:42,134
Thank you!

105
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,305
He's not waiting for luggage.

106
00:05:46,388 --> 00:05:48,348
What? He's walking straight out.

107
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:00,235
Get out of the way! Move!

108
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:03,071
Move, move, move, move!

109
00:06:04,656 --> 00:06:05,782
Sorry.

110
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:08,452
- Whoa, whoa!
- I'm service, I'm service.

111
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:10,871
I'm service! Move now!

112
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:17,520
- I need an image. Why is it dark in there?
- There's no cameras, ma'am.

113
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:19,224
- I want eyes now!
- Confirm with Stansted.

114
00:06:19,254 --> 00:06:21,924
Dogs, intercept!
Suspect's now landside. Where are you?

115
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:28,990
- There.
- He swapped backpacks.

116
00:06:29,014 --> 00:06:30,014
That's the handover.

117
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:31,849
Smash the glass.

118
00:06:33,352 --> 00:06:35,646
<i>This is an emergency.
Please evacuate.</i>

119
00:06:39,233 --> 00:06:42,152
Ladies and gentlemen,
please evacuation the terminal!

120
00:06:42,236 --> 00:06:43,880
Evacuate the terminal all the way…

121
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:45,989
- …this exit. This exit.
- Work out the safe areas.

122
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:47,550
Keep them safe. Don't let anyone pass.

123
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:58,919
This way please. Ladies and gentlemen,
this way. Quick as you can.

124
00:07:06,802 --> 00:07:07,845
Move, move, move, move!

125
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:11,640
Move!

126
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:22,568
Move! Aside!

127
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:25,195
Move! Out of the way! Now!

128
00:07:26,905 --> 00:07:28,699
He's headed for the Stansted Express.

129
00:07:31,285 --> 00:07:32,744
Get out of the way!

130
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:37,040
Move! Get to the side.

131
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:38,292
Come on!

132
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:42,421
Get it cleared. Full evacuation.

133
00:07:42,504 --> 00:07:44,144
Evacuate the entire train station.

134
00:07:44,173 --> 00:07:46,466
I want any trains
coming into Stansted halted.

135
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:48,670
Any trains that are in-bound,
I need to know about it.

136
00:07:48,719 --> 00:07:50,137
Move, move, move!

137
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:57,811
Move, move, move!

138
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,773
Move, move, move!

139
00:08:02,441 --> 00:08:04,985
- Move, move, move, move, move!
- This way!

140
00:08:06,028 --> 00:08:07,779
Keep moving, guys. Come on.

141
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:11,033
Place is closed! Stop! Stop!

142
00:08:11,116 --> 00:08:13,410
What are you doing?

143
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:30,511
Stop! No! Step away now!
Step away! Don't do it!

144
00:11:28,772 --> 00:11:29,773
No?

145
00:11:30,566 --> 00:11:31,859
Yeah? Great!

146
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:50,669
Standish.

147
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:04,266
- Are you all in?
- All except River and Sid.

148
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:07,227
Yeah, well,
the last one in can clean my lav.

149
00:12:10,564 --> 00:12:13,192
I thought spooks were
supposed to be stealthy.

150
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:21,116
Another day dawns on MI-Fucking Useless.

151
00:12:56,652 --> 00:12:57,986
Morning, Max.

152
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:00,030
The usual, Mr. Hobden?

153
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:02,115
Yes, Max. The usual.

154
00:13:08,914 --> 00:13:10,499
His name isn't Max.

155
00:13:11,792 --> 00:13:13,710
Well, it says "Max"
on the front of the shop.

156
00:13:13,794 --> 00:13:17,089
Yeah, but I heard the staff
call him Theo, short for Theodosios.

157
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:19,800
I'll stick with "Max." Shorter.

158
00:13:24,012 --> 00:13:25,305
There you go.

159
00:13:25,389 --> 00:13:27,224
Thank you, Max.

160
00:13:48,954 --> 00:13:50,205
What are you looking for?

161
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:54,334
A reason not to blow my brains out.

162
00:13:57,754 --> 00:13:59,673
He hasn't told me yet
what I'm looking for.

163
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:01,842
Dumping the rubbish this side of the room.

164
00:14:01,925 --> 00:14:04,303
Do you think Sid will find this
as amusing as you do?

165
00:14:11,476 --> 00:14:12,912
- Hello, Catherine.
- Morning.

166
00:14:12,936 --> 00:14:13,937
Morning.

167
00:14:16,231 --> 00:14:18,775
Bradford driving license applications,

168
00:14:18,859 --> 00:14:22,529
addresses, council tax records.
Cross-check.

169
00:14:23,071 --> 00:14:24,573
Well, these are from 2005.

170
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:28,052
The lending list
from Luton libraries in the last year.

171
00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:29,453
At least yours is topical.

172
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:31,764
Flag any borrowing
that suggests money laundering.

173
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:34,374
Really?
Someone looking that up in the library

174
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:36,378
probably doesn't have
that much money to launder.

175
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:38,587
Parking tickets from the Euston area.

176
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:42,799
From the '90s?

177
00:14:42,883 --> 00:14:44,343
No stone unturned, eh?

178
00:14:44,426 --> 00:14:45,469
Oh, Catherine!

179
00:14:45,552 --> 00:14:48,555
Catherine, before you go,
these two stick-in-the-muds

180
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:51,683
are giving my idea of a pub quiz team
a big thumbs down.

181
00:14:51,767 --> 00:14:53,519
Actually, I gave it a fat middle finger.

182
00:14:53,602 --> 00:14:57,147
Come on, guys! What about team spirit?
Catherine?

183
00:14:57,231 --> 00:14:58,232
No.

184
00:14:58,315 --> 00:15:01,527
- "No," as in "Ask me later," or-or no...
- As in, "no."

185
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:06,365
Tough nut to crack, that Catherine,
but I'll get there.

186
00:15:06,448 --> 00:15:08,909
- Forget it. She never lightens up.
- Would you?

187
00:15:08,992 --> 00:15:11,161
If I was Lamb's lackey, no.

188
00:15:11,245 --> 00:15:14,248
No, I meant what happened before.
Before she came here.

189
00:15:14,331 --> 00:15:16,667
Yeah, well, I... I wish Lamb
would go that way.

190
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:24,883
Is today the day you finally give me
something remotely challenging?

191
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:28,637
Flight inquiries to Syria
from the previous decade.

192
00:15:29,179 --> 00:15:31,014
No, it isn't.

193
00:15:31,098 --> 00:15:32,683
Well, I'll set up an algorithm for that

194
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:35,853
and treat the remaining nine hours
of the day as my own time.

195
00:15:36,979 --> 00:15:39,523
Jed? Transport police are asking

196
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:42,401
if you can stop scaring people away
from that bus stop.

197
00:15:43,277 --> 00:15:46,572
- They could be watching us.
- Or they could be waiting for a bus.

198
00:15:47,322 --> 00:15:49,575
Also, Lamb says there's a new hire

199
00:15:49,658 --> 00:15:51,451
- at the Chinese down...
- Oh, fuck me!

200
00:15:51,535 --> 00:15:53,137
- And he'd like...
- I know, I know.

201
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:54,413
Interview and background.

202
00:15:54,496 --> 00:15:57,916
And if he happens to be undocumented, it's
five free meals to look the other way.

203
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,209
Man.

204
00:16:00,043 --> 00:16:02,588
No, I've been keeping me eyes
on the water.

205
00:16:02,671 --> 00:16:04,298
I'm just waiting for a fin to surface,

206
00:16:04,381 --> 00:16:09,428
but I need you to guarantee me
2,000 words once it breaks.

207
00:16:09,511 --> 00:16:11,263
It's like your Watergate.

208
00:16:12,931 --> 00:16:15,225
You know what?
I can't tell you now because it...

209
00:16:23,775 --> 00:16:27,279
Sorry, um, the reason I interrupted before

210
00:16:27,362 --> 00:16:31,533
is because I spent a year studying
in Greece and the name caught my ear.

211
00:16:32,034 --> 00:16:34,203
Was a great country
a couple of thousand years ago.

212
00:16:34,286 --> 00:16:35,954
Yeah.

213
00:16:36,038 --> 00:16:39,499
And I'm interrupting now because
I was hoping I could borrow your <i>Times</i>.

214
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,837
Fine.

215
00:16:43,921 --> 00:16:45,380
Thank you.

216
00:16:45,464 --> 00:16:47,090
Oh, what...

217
00:16:47,174 --> 00:16:48,800
- Oh, my God. I am so...
- Oh, shit.

218
00:16:48,884 --> 00:16:50,969
- I am so sorry. I'm so sorry. Sorry.
- Oh, shit.

219
00:16:51,637 --> 00:16:56,016
Can I please have some towels? Okay.
Can I just have some serviettes?

220
00:16:56,099 --> 00:16:58,185
No, I need more serviettes.

221
00:16:58,268 --> 00:17:00,771
- God, I'm so, um, um...
- Here. Here.

222
00:17:00,854 --> 00:17:02,481
Yeah, napkins. Can we get some more?

223
00:17:02,564 --> 00:17:03,690
- Oh!
- Thank you.

224
00:17:03,774 --> 00:17:07,277
Max, this is not enough. Have you...
Have you got any more serviettes?

225
00:17:07,361 --> 00:17:09,570
- Max, pass me that.
- Take this. Take this.

226
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:13,742
- Just leave it. Excuse me.
- I'm so, so clumsy.

227
00:17:13,825 --> 00:17:16,369
- Would you leave it?
- No, I feel so bad. Is your laptop okay?

228
00:17:16,453 --> 00:17:18,413
It's okay. Let me clean it up now.

229
00:17:18,955 --> 00:17:19,998
Fuck!

230
00:17:20,582 --> 00:17:22,291
Fucking…

231
00:17:39,685 --> 00:17:40,811
You thumped?

232
00:17:42,437 --> 00:17:43,647
Did you find anything?

233
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:46,608
I don't know what I'm looking for.

234
00:17:46,692 --> 00:17:50,779
Yeah, uh, the remnants
of a once-promising career.

235
00:17:52,948 --> 00:17:56,451
Are we actually acting on any intel,
or are we just fishing?

236
00:17:56,535 --> 00:17:58,829
Yeah, but now,
you don't get to ask questions.

237
00:17:59,329 --> 00:18:02,291
That's for spies who haven't shat the bed.

238
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:06,420
So, what did you find? Any old notebooks?

239
00:18:07,671 --> 00:18:10,132
Uh, the cardboard backing of one,
but no pages.

240
00:18:10,215 --> 00:18:11,592
Evidence of drug use?

241
00:18:11,675 --> 00:18:13,635
Empty box of paracetamol, yeah.

242
00:18:13,719 --> 00:18:15,179
Empty booze bottles?

243
00:18:15,262 --> 00:18:17,431
In his recycling bin, I imagine.

244
00:18:17,514 --> 00:18:19,433
Oh, Christ.

245
00:18:19,516 --> 00:18:23,729
Is it me, or did all the fun
go out of everything around 1979?

246
00:18:23,812 --> 00:18:25,230
Are we looking for something,

247
00:18:25,314 --> 00:18:27,417
or are we just wanting him to know
that we are looking at him?

248
00:18:27,441 --> 00:18:30,611
What's all this "we"? There is no "we."

249
00:18:30,694 --> 00:18:33,488
There's just me telling you what to do.

250
00:18:33,572 --> 00:18:36,575
Okay. Do you want to tell me
to put him under surveillance?

251
00:18:36,658 --> 00:18:38,452
Who?

252
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:40,621
Hobden.

253
00:18:41,413 --> 00:18:44,333
Wha... Wha...
You would be doing the surveillance?

254
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:45,542
Yeah.

255
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:47,461
- You?
- Yeah.

256
00:18:47,544 --> 00:18:50,380
Well...

257
00:18:50,464 --> 00:18:53,050
That's a... Well,
that's an interesting proposition,

258
00:18:53,133 --> 00:18:57,012
considering the last time
you were given any sort of responsibility,

259
00:18:57,095 --> 00:18:59,306
a load of innocent people
got blown to bits.

260
00:18:59,389 --> 00:19:00,557
And there it is.

261
00:19:00,641 --> 00:19:03,310
Well, I'm sorry you find it so tiresome,
Cartwright,

262
00:19:03,393 --> 00:19:06,480
but it's not the social faux pas
you seem to think it was.

263
00:19:06,563 --> 00:19:10,275
You... You didn't break wind
during someone's wedding vows.

264
00:19:10,901 --> 00:19:15,030
What was it? Uh, 149 dead, 212 injured,

265
00:19:15,113 --> 00:19:19,076
uh, three million in damages,
half a billion in lost revenue...

266
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:20,744
It was a training exercise.

267
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:25,374
If a pilot crashes a simulator,
he doesn't then brush it off and go,

268
00:19:25,457 --> 00:19:27,918
"Well, I'm sorry.
It was a fucking exercise,"

269
00:19:28,001 --> 00:19:31,255
and then expect to be
put behind the wheel of a 747.

270
00:19:31,338 --> 00:19:34,508
- It's not the same thing.
- No, it's worse, you tit.

271
00:19:37,344 --> 00:19:40,156
- You're gonna do this every day then?
- If I didn't hate the sight of you,

272
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:42,891
I'd come to your home
and do it at the weekends too.

273
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:48,063
I am surrounded by fuckups
in this building,

274
00:19:48,146 --> 00:19:50,190
but you are the gold standard of fuckups.

275
00:19:50,274 --> 00:19:52,651
By all rights, you shouldn't even be here.

276
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:56,089
You should've skipped this purgatory
and gone straight to hell.

277
00:19:56,113 --> 00:19:57,322
Melted you down for glue.

278
00:19:57,406 --> 00:20:01,201
But you avoided that
because your name is Cartwright.

279
00:20:01,285 --> 00:20:04,705
So when you wonder why I have you
going through the rubbish

280
00:20:04,788 --> 00:20:08,000
of a disgraced right-wing journo,
wonder no more.

281
00:20:09,084 --> 00:20:12,254
It's because I don't like you.

282
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:14,840
And I want you to quit.

283
00:20:17,509 --> 00:20:20,387
I'll just get back to, uh,
retching then, shall I?

284
00:20:22,639 --> 00:20:24,474
Ah, nice one, Sid.

285
00:20:25,309 --> 00:20:28,228
Standish! Flashbox.

286
00:20:31,106 --> 00:20:32,649
- Is this Hobden's?
- It's mine.

287
00:20:32,733 --> 00:20:34,193
He has a USB stick on his key ring.

288
00:20:34,276 --> 00:20:36,653
I distracted him
and copied the contents onto here.

289
00:20:36,737 --> 00:20:38,280
Well, he notice?

290
00:20:38,363 --> 00:20:40,258
Never looked at his keys,
never looked at my laptop.

291
00:20:40,282 --> 00:20:42,743
You see, Cartwright. She is a good agent.

292
00:20:42,826 --> 00:20:46,663
And this is why I put Sid on surveillance
and not you.

293
00:20:46,747 --> 00:20:49,041
You still want me to itemize his rubbish,
though, do you?

294
00:20:49,124 --> 00:20:51,335
That? Oh, yeah, yeah.
And, uh, when you're done,

295
00:20:51,418 --> 00:20:53,337
save me the bother
and chuck it all in the bin.

296
00:20:54,296 --> 00:20:55,547
What was on the stick?

297
00:20:55,631 --> 00:20:57,090
I don't know. It's not my remit.

298
00:20:57,716 --> 00:20:59,611
What do you mean not your...
Just tell me what was on the stick.

299
00:20:59,635 --> 00:21:01,136
Hey, I've got a call to make,

300
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:03,639
so if the pair of you wouldn't mind,
you know, fucking off.

301
00:21:09,478 --> 00:21:10,938
Uh, get me Lady Di.

302
00:21:11,563 --> 00:21:14,525
- Why did he have us both on Hobden?
- Well, you weren't really on him.

303
00:21:15,108 --> 00:21:17,110
No, but two agents
on a has-been journalist.

304
00:21:17,194 --> 00:21:19,071
That just... It just feels like overkill.

305
00:21:19,154 --> 00:21:21,406
Especially when we don't run ops
from Slough House.

306
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:23,992
Apparently, we do, River. Or I do.

307
00:21:24,076 --> 00:21:26,328
- You never call me River.
- I never call anyone River.

308
00:21:26,411 --> 00:21:28,830
Yeah, well, thank my mother.
It was her hippie phase.

309
00:21:28,914 --> 00:21:30,332
I got what you wanted.

310
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:32,793
<i>All of it?

311
00:21:32,876 --> 00:21:36,421
There was nothing in the rubbish,
but we got his laptop files.

312
00:21:37,923 --> 00:21:39,591
You sending a courier?

313
00:21:39,675 --> 00:21:41,552
I'm not gonna waste
one of my grown-up spies.

314
00:21:41,635 --> 00:21:43,011
Send one of your donkeys.

315
00:21:43,095 --> 00:21:45,764
Okay, but I, uh...
I can't guarantee it'll get there.

316
00:21:45,848 --> 00:21:48,183
Send Sid Baker. She's the most capable.

317
00:21:48,267 --> 00:21:50,269
<i>Oh, you mean the least shit?</i>

318
00:21:51,186 --> 00:21:54,898
Uh, and just to be clear, Diana,
you owe me.

319
00:21:54,982 --> 00:21:57,317
Whatever you say, Jackson.

320
00:21:57,401 --> 00:21:59,361
Who's it going to?

321
00:22:05,909 --> 00:22:07,703
Are you gonna clean this rubbish up?

322
00:22:09,162 --> 00:22:11,373
No, no, I...
I thought I'd just leave it there.

323
00:22:12,416 --> 00:22:15,085
Yes. Of course I'm gonna clean it up.

324
00:22:15,169 --> 00:22:16,170
When?

325
00:22:16,753 --> 00:22:19,464
When you give me a chance.
I've literally just sat down.

326
00:22:19,548 --> 00:22:21,842
Okay, well, here's your chance.
I'm going for a coffee.

327
00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:23,969
You've already had a coffee.

328
00:22:24,803 --> 00:22:26,722
I'm allowed more than one. I'm a big girl.

329
00:22:27,764 --> 00:22:30,267
The gloves really suit you, by the way.

330
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:32,662
- Taking the piss, is it?
- I wouldn't know where to start.

331
00:22:32,686 --> 00:22:34,438
Bye.

332
00:22:47,117 --> 00:22:48,118
Oh.

333
00:22:49,661 --> 00:22:51,747
I was thumping for Sid.

334
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:53,457
Sid's gone for coffee.

335
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:57,336
No, she's already had coffee.
She was getting away from you.

336
00:22:58,795 --> 00:23:00,422
Failure's contagious.

337
00:23:01,798 --> 00:23:02,883
Deliver this.

338
00:23:03,634 --> 00:23:05,219
Where?

339
00:23:05,302 --> 00:23:06,803
Regent's Park.

340
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,390
Oh, so this Hobden thing is Regent's Park?

341
00:23:10,974 --> 00:23:14,811
Yeah, of course it bloody is.
We don't run ops from Slough House.

342
00:23:16,355 --> 00:23:17,606
Why would they get us to do it?

343
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:21,170
And why do they want me to deliver it?

344
00:23:21,235 --> 00:23:24,530
They don't. They want Sid,
but she's not here, so I'm sending you.

345
00:23:24,613 --> 00:23:26,448
Who's the contact?

346
00:23:30,285 --> 00:23:31,411
Webb.

347
00:23:34,081 --> 00:23:35,832
Isn't he an old mate of yours?

348
00:23:43,257 --> 00:23:44,800
Don't leave it on the bus.

349
00:24:32,139 --> 00:24:34,266
Fuck! Ow.

350
00:24:58,916 --> 00:25:01,710
Go straight. On the right.

351
00:25:20,854 --> 00:25:24,149
Hi. Uh, River Cartwright delivering
for James Webb.

352
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:30,948
You are with…

353
00:25:31,573 --> 00:25:33,867
Wi... MI5. Same as you.

354
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:35,744
You're not showing up.

355
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:40,958
I'm over at Aldersgate.

356
00:25:41,041 --> 00:25:42,876
Aldersgate?

357
00:25:44,837 --> 00:25:46,088
Slough House.

358
00:25:48,298 --> 00:25:50,717
You'll need a visitor's pass.
Look into here.

359
00:26:07,776 --> 00:26:09,528
Thank you.

360
00:26:14,533 --> 00:26:17,995
Uh, sorry. Uh, can you sit over there?
You have to wait for an escort.

361
00:26:53,155 --> 00:26:54,156
This way.

362
00:27:06,376 --> 00:27:07,377
Come.

363
00:27:12,257 --> 00:27:14,259
River. Didn't know it'd be you.

364
00:27:21,725 --> 00:27:23,143
Let's not make this awkward.

365
00:27:23,977 --> 00:27:25,246
Has someone thrown up on your tie?

366
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:28,899
Okay, awkward it is.
It's Karl Unger, peasant.

367
00:27:29,608 --> 00:27:31,408
Cut yourself shaving as well.
That's annoying.

368
00:27:31,485 --> 00:27:34,112
Yeah. Well, technically it wasn't me.

369
00:27:34,196 --> 00:27:36,865
I get a wet shave most mornings
at Truefitt & Hill.

370
00:27:36,949 --> 00:27:38,200
- Truefitt & Hill. Oh.
- Mmm.

371
00:27:40,244 --> 00:27:41,954
Keep a lot of hard copy in here,
don't you?

372
00:27:42,037 --> 00:27:43,330
Bit above your pay grade, mate.

373
00:27:46,416 --> 00:27:49,086
- Oh, my God. You're in HR.
- It's not HR. It's vetting.

374
00:27:49,169 --> 00:27:51,731
Call it what you like. It's still not
really being an agent, is it?

375
00:27:51,755 --> 00:27:52,756
Laptop.

376
00:27:56,635 --> 00:27:57,761
What's this? No flashbox?

377
00:27:57,845 --> 00:28:00,681
Uh, no. I've heard of those but,
I mean, it's Slough House.

378
00:28:00,764 --> 00:28:02,492
Frankly,
I'm amazed we've still got Jiffy bags.

379
00:28:02,516 --> 00:28:04,268
You want this back?

380
00:28:05,769 --> 00:28:07,497
Are you ever gonna admit that
you made a mistake?

381
00:28:07,521 --> 00:28:09,565
- Still on that.
- Yeah.

382
00:28:09,648 --> 00:28:11,334
"Blue shirt, white tee."
That's what you said.

383
00:28:11,358 --> 00:28:14,069
You fucked up. Yes, you did. Not me, you.

384
00:28:14,152 --> 00:28:15,571
And you let me take the fall.

385
00:28:15,654 --> 00:28:18,699
Own your mistakes, River.
Stansted was your fiasco.

386
00:28:18,782 --> 00:28:21,159
Well, I mean, I get it.
I was clearly Taverner's favorite.

387
00:28:21,243 --> 00:28:23,054
- Really?
- Uh, yeah, and that really annoyed you,

388
00:28:23,078 --> 00:28:24,705
really got under your skin, didn't it?

389
00:28:24,788 --> 00:28:28,292
So you not only covered for your fiasco,
you got me out of the way.

390
00:28:28,375 --> 00:28:30,085
It's always about you, isn't it?

391
00:28:30,169 --> 00:28:32,337
What about the people who lost
their lives and limbs?

392
00:28:32,421 --> 00:28:34,381
- It wasn't real.
- What is this then?

393
00:28:34,464 --> 00:28:37,885
Other than a new training module entitled,
"How to avoid a fucking fiasco."

394
00:28:37,968 --> 00:28:39,761
It did... Fuck off. It wasn't a...

395
00:28:39,845 --> 00:28:43,557
He's dead. She's dead. Injured. Dead.

396
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,350
- Maimed, that one.
- No. Actor.

397
00:28:45,434 --> 00:28:47,811
- Mortally injured. Maimed. He's dying.
- Actor.

398
00:28:47,895 --> 00:28:50,647
It was a training exercise.

399
00:28:50,731 --> 00:28:55,277
Yeah. It was. It was an exercise,
but if it had been real, they'd have died.

400
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:59,573
You fucked up. Massively.
Un-fucking-forgivably.

401
00:29:00,073 --> 00:29:03,535
And you did genuinely
injure some of them. Wait, where is it?

402
00:29:04,828 --> 00:29:06,997
I... I love this bit. It's my favorite.

403
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:10,959
Here he comes. Here he comes.
Painful.

404
00:29:11,043 --> 00:29:13,295
He won't dance again.

405
00:29:13,378 --> 00:29:16,465
Yeah, well, there's no lives in your hands
here in HR, is there?

406
00:29:16,548 --> 00:29:20,093
Yeah, and what have you got in your hands
at Slough House apart from your dick?

407
00:29:21,386 --> 00:29:22,930
Escort.

408
00:29:23,013 --> 00:29:24,723
You know why they call it Slough House?

409
00:29:24,806 --> 00:29:27,935
Yes. But I imagine you're gonna tell me
what it is. Yeah, why not?

410
00:29:28,018 --> 00:29:30,604
It's because, while it may only be
three miles from where I sit,

411
00:29:30,687 --> 00:29:33,857
it is so far from the beating heart
of the service

412
00:29:33,941 --> 00:29:35,317
it might as well be in Slough.

413
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:38,111
Yeah, if you have to explain a joke,
it's 'cause it's not working.

414
00:29:38,195 --> 00:29:39,905
I heard your grandfather…

415
00:29:40,781 --> 00:29:43,367
He had to pull whatever strings
he still had access to

416
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:45,077
to stop you being kicked out altogether.

417
00:29:47,079 --> 00:29:50,791
That must've hurt him.
Having to beg for his grandson like that.

418
00:30:00,133 --> 00:30:02,386
Fuck you, Spider.

419
00:30:03,136 --> 00:30:04,948
- This is a professional work environment.
- Right.

420
00:30:04,972 --> 00:30:06,098
I don't go by that anymore.

421
00:30:06,181 --> 00:30:07,933
Ah, okay. Thanks, Spider.

422
00:30:08,016 --> 00:30:09,828
- He's all done here. Show him out.
- Thanks, Spider.

423
00:30:09,852 --> 00:30:11,770
He loves being called that,
by the way. Spider.

424
00:30:11,854 --> 00:30:12,938
Never call me that.

425
00:30:16,984 --> 00:30:19,361
Excuse me! Your pass.

426
00:30:46,305 --> 00:30:48,807
Oh. This is everything from today.

427
00:30:57,232 --> 00:30:58,984
What did your last servant die of?

428
00:31:01,486 --> 00:31:04,323
What did your last boss die of?

429
00:31:52,037 --> 00:31:53,830
- Good night.
- Yep.

430
00:31:54,748 --> 00:31:55,832
Fucking hell.

431
00:31:59,253 --> 00:32:03,382
Anybody fancy a swift half, hey?
Or better still, a slow pint?

432
00:32:03,465 --> 00:32:06,885
Um, I've got a friend coming over.
I can't tonight.

433
00:32:06,969 --> 00:32:08,887
Oh, I better get back to the family.

434
00:32:08,971 --> 00:32:12,641
So? Text them
that you're busy saving the nation.

435
00:32:12,724 --> 00:32:15,936
I like to be there for the kids' bedtime,
but, you know, another evening.

436
00:32:16,019 --> 00:32:17,729
But you always say that.

437
00:32:18,313 --> 00:32:20,065
- Well, maybe tomorrow.
- Tomorrow then.

438
00:32:20,148 --> 00:32:22,150
- Louisa, tomorrow?
- Yeah. Maybe tomorrow.

439
00:32:22,234 --> 00:32:24,278
It's a date. Laters.

440
00:32:45,215 --> 00:32:48,427
<i>We hang our heads
when they should be held up high.</i>

441
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:50,888
<i>We stuck two fingers up at the Luftwaffe,</i>

442
00:32:50,971 --> 00:32:56,560
<i>yet we can't stop these people
crossing the Channel, the English Channel,</i>

443
00:32:56,643 --> 00:32:58,228
<i>in their rubber dinghies.</i>

444
00:32:58,312 --> 00:33:01,190
<i>Get out the Navy, I say. The Royal Navy.</i>

445
00:33:01,273 --> 00:33:04,735
<i>Whatever it takes to keep Britain British.</i>

446
00:33:07,154 --> 00:33:08,947
- Fuck.
- How long have you been here?

447
00:33:09,031 --> 00:33:10,949
- What?
- You look like a mole.

448
00:33:12,075 --> 00:33:13,160
A mole?

449
00:33:13,785 --> 00:33:15,662
Are you a closet nationalist now?

450
00:33:15,746 --> 00:33:17,998
- Oh, no. I found it in Hobden's rubbish.
- River.

451
00:33:18,081 --> 00:33:20,709
Yes, yes, yes. Yes, I know.
I still need to clean up.

452
00:33:20,792 --> 00:33:24,213
Just, um, ended up down
a pretty dark rabbit hole.

453
00:33:24,296 --> 00:33:26,577
All rabbit holes are dark.
They're underground.

454
00:33:27,257 --> 00:33:30,010
- Thanks.
- What's this?

455
00:33:30,761 --> 00:33:32,304
Greg Simmonds. You know him?

456
00:33:32,387 --> 00:33:34,574
Yeah. Sleazy businessman
who can't get over the fact

457
00:33:34,598 --> 00:33:35,974
Britain won a war 70 years ago.

458
00:33:36,058 --> 00:33:39,311
A war that he seems to think was actually
fought against ethnic minorities

459
00:33:39,394 --> 00:33:43,148
and political correctness
rather than the Nazis. Yeah.

460
00:33:43,774 --> 00:33:45,067
Yeah.

461
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:47,611
You ever listen
to one of his speeches? Uh…

462
00:33:49,613 --> 00:33:52,407
<i>These immigrants
say they don't like our religion.</i>

463
00:33:52,491 --> 00:33:54,535
<i>They don't like our way of life.</i>

464
00:33:55,619 --> 00:33:58,747
<i>And yet it's us that get arrested
by our own police force</i>

465
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:01,667
<i>for saying the wrong things.
For telling jokes.</i>

466
00:34:02,292 --> 00:34:03,412
<i>I tell you, this is a war...</i>

467
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:05,671
Yeah.
I can't take any more of that.

468
00:34:05,754 --> 00:34:09,591
MI5 reckon that he has been funding
a lot of these new hate groups.

469
00:34:10,384 --> 00:34:12,761
Spends his time rubbing shoulders
with politicians

470
00:34:12,844 --> 00:34:14,804
while immigrants have
their homes burned down.

471
00:34:14,888 --> 00:34:18,433
I'm not sure this is a great way to be
spending your spare time.

472
00:34:19,101 --> 00:34:20,853
You've seen my work on the floor.

473
00:34:20,936 --> 00:34:24,982
Oh, cry me a river, River.
No, seriously, as a friend...

474
00:34:25,065 --> 00:34:28,025
As a friend? Are we friends?

475
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:30,922
I don't think I'm ready to make that kind
of commitment, to be honest with you.

476
00:34:30,946 --> 00:34:34,074
Look, what I'm seeing right now
is just not good for your dating profile.

477
00:34:34,157 --> 00:34:35,576
What are you? My dating coach?

478
00:34:35,659 --> 00:34:37,995
Absolutely not. That'd be a full-time job.

479
00:34:38,078 --> 00:34:41,331
All right. You're here after hours.
What's your excuse?

480
00:34:41,415 --> 00:34:43,000
I left my phone charger.

481
00:34:43,708 --> 00:34:45,979
A phone charger. You came all the way back
for a phone charger?

482
00:34:46,003 --> 00:34:48,380
- I was having drinks nearby.
- Well, thanks for the invite.

483
00:34:49,422 --> 00:34:51,425
I've invited you before
and you turned me down.

484
00:34:51,507 --> 00:34:52,568
- What? No...
- Once bitten…

485
00:34:52,592 --> 00:34:53,886
- No, you haven't.
- Yes, I have.

486
00:34:53,969 --> 00:34:55,179
No. It...

487
00:34:57,139 --> 00:34:58,432
Fucking hell.

488
00:34:58,515 --> 00:35:02,603
If people are happy to spend time
in this building after 5:00 p.m.,

489
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,981
then I'm not really doing my job.

490
00:35:07,983 --> 00:35:09,401
Uh, I left my phone charger.

491
00:35:09,943 --> 00:35:11,987
I was gonna clean up the rubbish. Sorry.

492
00:35:14,072 --> 00:35:15,115
Fuck off.

493
00:35:16,241 --> 00:35:19,578
"Fuck off" as in go home,
or "fuck off" as in you don't believe us?

494
00:35:20,078 --> 00:35:25,083
At the end of the working day,
your pitiful, miserable time is your own.

495
00:35:26,126 --> 00:35:32,382
But if I find out you are indulging
in extracurricular activities

496
00:35:32,466 --> 00:35:36,970
that could upset the equilibrium
of this blessed sanctuary,

497
00:35:38,138 --> 00:35:42,726
then I will make it so that
you wish you were in a Siberian gulag.

498
00:36:09,795 --> 00:36:11,171
Mmm. Twice in one day.

499
00:36:11,755 --> 00:36:14,800
That girl earlier.
The one who spilled my coffee.

500
00:36:14,883 --> 00:36:17,302
Did she leave soon after me?

501
00:36:17,386 --> 00:36:20,264
I can't remember. I think so.

502
00:36:21,306 --> 00:36:23,475
Well, has she been in here before?

503
00:36:23,559 --> 00:36:24,852
A few times recently.

504
00:36:26,270 --> 00:36:30,524
Oh, yeah. Well, if she comes in again…

505
00:36:33,569 --> 00:36:34,778
Give me a call.

506
00:36:35,487 --> 00:36:36,572
- Yeah?
- Sure.

507
00:36:48,625 --> 00:36:49,751
Dirty old man.

508
00:37:23,202 --> 00:37:27,331
Yeah, looking back I probably
already had a drinking problem.

509
00:37:27,414 --> 00:37:33,420
But, um, when my dad died,
I just got really, really lost.

510
00:37:33,504 --> 00:37:36,965
He was 56. Aneurysm. Gone.

511
00:37:38,175 --> 00:37:40,135
Yeah, it totally upended me.

512
00:37:41,845 --> 00:37:44,681
I, uh...
I started suffering from blackouts.

513
00:37:44,765 --> 00:37:46,767
<i>Charles.</i>

514
00:37:46,850 --> 00:37:48,602
Morning, Charles.

515
00:37:49,186 --> 00:37:52,523
…couldn't be with me
unless I got sober. So I did.

516
00:37:54,024 --> 00:37:55,904
But I did it more
for my dad's memory.

517
00:37:55,943 --> 00:37:57,110
<i>Charles?</i>

518
00:37:58,904 --> 00:37:59,905
<i>Charles?</i>

519
00:38:08,997 --> 00:38:10,249
Charles.

520
00:38:14,127 --> 00:38:15,128
Charles.

521
00:38:16,964 --> 00:38:19,299
Charles.

522
00:38:19,925 --> 00:38:22,803
Catherine.

523
00:38:22,886 --> 00:38:25,055
Catherine. You haven't spoken.

524
00:38:27,182 --> 00:38:30,352
Um, my name's Catherine. I'm an alcoholic.

525
00:38:30,435 --> 00:38:31,937
Hi, Catherine.

526
00:38:32,521 --> 00:38:34,064
I'll just listen tonight.

527
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:24,757
You know
you left the front door open?

528
00:39:24,781 --> 00:39:25,908
I saw you driving up.

529
00:39:26,575 --> 00:39:28,535
Are you sure you didn't leave it
open by mistake?

530
00:39:32,831 --> 00:39:34,166
I prepared a second piece.

531
00:39:39,546 --> 00:39:40,672
You can cook.

532
00:39:42,508 --> 00:39:44,760
Have you heard
from your mother recently?

533
00:39:44,843 --> 00:39:45,844
Oh.

534
00:39:46,678 --> 00:39:50,140
Yeah.
A postcard from Istanbul of all places.

535
00:39:51,517 --> 00:39:54,728
She's opening a guesthouse
with her current boyfriend.

536
00:39:56,104 --> 00:39:57,814
And you're out of lemons.

537
00:39:57,898 --> 00:40:01,652
Yeah, well, that plan will have changed
by the time the card arrived.

538
00:40:01,735 --> 00:40:03,362
Yeah. Boyfriend too, knowing her.

539
00:40:04,321 --> 00:40:07,324
You know,
I always expected her to turn up here

540
00:40:07,407 --> 00:40:09,618
with a KGB spook on her arm.

541
00:40:11,286 --> 00:40:13,413
That would have been
the ultimate rebellion.

542
00:40:13,497 --> 00:40:15,058
No. This is...
It's as hard as an egg, this.

543
00:40:15,082 --> 00:40:16,559
You know they keep better in the fridge.

544
00:40:16,583 --> 00:40:19,086
I always understood a lemon
could last as long

545
00:40:19,169 --> 00:40:20,921
as an 18th century naval voyage.

546
00:40:21,004 --> 00:40:22,756
Yes. Well, this is the 21st century,

547
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:26,176
so we can take full advantage of modern
food-preservation techniques.

548
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:28,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Oh, the chicken's burning.

549
00:40:29,388 --> 00:40:30,556
Shit.

550
00:40:30,639 --> 00:40:33,684
No, it's not bu... It's searing.
It's exactly the way I wanted it.

551
00:40:39,398 --> 00:40:41,567
Did you ever come across Robert Hobden?

552
00:40:42,651 --> 00:40:46,446
Ah. So you didn't visit me
just to lecture me

553
00:40:46,530 --> 00:40:49,157
on home safety and food hygiene.

554
00:40:49,241 --> 00:40:52,911
- No, no. I wanted to see you too. I did.
- Not wanted to see me that much lately.

555
00:40:52,995 --> 00:40:57,124
Yeah. Well, not really been that much
to report, has there? From Slough House.

556
00:40:57,207 --> 00:40:59,293
They won't keep you there forever.

557
00:40:59,835 --> 00:41:02,155
I was given the impression
that they probably will.

558
00:41:02,212 --> 00:41:03,755
Well, that's the point.

559
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:06,675
If you knew it was for only six months,
it wouldn't hurt.

560
00:41:06,758 --> 00:41:08,969
Yeah. It's been eight months.

561
00:41:09,052 --> 00:41:13,640
Well, you do your time. Whatever
grunt work Jackson Lamb throws your way.

562
00:41:13,724 --> 00:41:17,519
Then you head back to Regent's Park.
Your sins forgiven.

563
00:41:17,603 --> 00:41:20,163
Lamb's been there years,
so they've obviously never forgiven him.

564
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:21,732
The man practically lives there.

565
00:41:21,815 --> 00:41:24,902
Was he ever actually good?
I just... I can't imagine it.

566
00:41:26,486 --> 00:41:27,487
I'll lay the table.

567
00:41:31,909 --> 00:41:35,996
You are not listening to me, Jack.
There is gonna be an attack.

568
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:38,540
People are going to get hurt.

569
00:41:38,624 --> 00:41:41,335
I can't tell you any more
because I'll put myself at risk.

570
00:41:42,419 --> 00:41:45,839
No, no.
Forget about any fucking loyalty to me.

571
00:41:45,923 --> 00:41:47,758
Do this for your country.

572
00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:57,059
Fine. But know this.
There will be blood on your hands.

573
00:42:12,699 --> 00:42:14,660
You are coming tonight, aren't you?

574
00:42:14,743 --> 00:42:16,161
Of course I am.

575
00:42:16,245 --> 00:42:18,622
Good. 'Cause genuinely,
I might need backup.

576
00:42:18,705 --> 00:42:20,249
Have they started on you again?

577
00:42:20,832 --> 00:42:25,128
People are messaging the club
saying that they shouldn't book me.

578
00:42:25,212 --> 00:42:26,213
What?

579
00:42:26,296 --> 00:42:28,882
It's like you can't even say
the word "religion" now

580
00:42:28,966 --> 00:42:30,676
without somebody taking offense.

581
00:42:30,759 --> 00:42:33,220
- Yeah.
- My stuff isn't even that controversial.

582
00:42:33,303 --> 00:42:35,430
And the stuff that is was written by you.

583
00:42:35,514 --> 00:42:36,849
Yeah.

584
00:42:38,016 --> 00:42:39,856
Are you sure you just
don't wanna get up there?

585
00:42:40,477 --> 00:42:44,857
Look, I will sit in the audience
and confuse everybody

586
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:48,235
by laughing loudly each time
you mention Muslims.

587
00:42:58,328 --> 00:42:59,663
Here you go.

588
00:43:01,248 --> 00:43:02,374
Thank you.

589
00:43:02,457 --> 00:43:04,001
So, what happened to your hand?

590
00:43:05,127 --> 00:43:07,129
Oh. Nothing. I burned it on a grill.

591
00:43:08,046 --> 00:43:09,882
Was there a flashbox in the grill?

592
00:43:13,468 --> 00:43:15,971
All right. Yes, I tried to open
a flashbox without the code.

593
00:43:16,054 --> 00:43:18,223
Stupid thing to do.
Have you had it seen to?

594
00:43:18,307 --> 00:43:20,434
No, no. It's fine.
It's nothing to worry about.

595
00:43:23,312 --> 00:43:24,479
What was in the box?

596
00:43:27,107 --> 00:43:30,944
A laptop.
With files taken from Robert Hobden.

597
00:43:31,904 --> 00:43:33,405
Anyone know you pulled this stunt?

598
00:43:33,488 --> 00:43:36,325
- No. No.
- Good. Good. Keep it that way.

599
00:43:36,909 --> 00:43:37,951
Yes.

600
00:43:40,078 --> 00:43:41,496
It's just strange. It's just...

601
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:44,708
It's not the usual crap
they get you to do there in Slough House.

602
00:43:44,791 --> 00:43:48,712
It's... I mean the Park are on it.
They're on Hobden.

603
00:43:48,795 --> 00:43:50,297
- Why?
- I don't know.

604
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:53,133
- That's what I was trying to find out.
- Hmm.

605
00:43:54,009 --> 00:43:56,178
And I was hoping that you could
just tell me.

606
00:43:57,596 --> 00:44:00,140
Yeah, well, um…

607
00:44:01,892 --> 00:44:05,020
Hobden had had a run-in with MI5 before.

608
00:44:06,146 --> 00:44:08,023
He was a communist in his youth.

609
00:44:08,815 --> 00:44:13,987
Then he changed sides.
One-nation Tory, star columnist.

610
00:44:14,613 --> 00:44:17,074
Then the loathsome drift to the far right.

611
00:44:17,157 --> 00:44:19,618
His career ended when his name appeared

612
00:44:19,701 --> 00:44:23,789
on a leaked list of donors
to the British Patriotic Party.

613
00:44:23,872 --> 00:44:27,251
Hobden always claimed that it was MI5
that leaked the list.

614
00:44:28,168 --> 00:44:31,380
I can't comment, but if we didn't do it,
we should've done.

615
00:44:32,548 --> 00:44:36,051
Can't have fascists hiding in plain sight.

616
00:44:36,802 --> 00:44:39,847
But, I mean, he's no one.
He's... The man's a has-been.

617
00:44:39,930 --> 00:44:41,825
I just don't understand
why they even bother looking at him.

618
00:44:41,849 --> 00:44:45,227
I've told you all I know,
and you should stay out of it.

619
00:44:45,310 --> 00:44:48,063
And if the Park are looking at him,
there'll be a good reason.

620
00:44:48,856 --> 00:44:50,941
And if they're using
Slough House to do it,

621
00:44:51,024 --> 00:44:52,943
it means they don't want blowback.

622
00:44:54,027 --> 00:44:56,071
Which puts you at risk.

623
00:44:59,116 --> 00:45:00,242
You understand?

624
00:45:02,452 --> 00:45:03,996
And remember… hmm?

625
00:45:06,582 --> 00:45:09,918
Moscow rules, watch your back.
London rules, cover your arse.

626
00:45:10,002 --> 00:45:11,503
- Yeah.
- Very good.

627
00:45:13,088 --> 00:45:16,133
How come every picture of Jesus

628
00:45:16,216 --> 00:45:18,802
has him looking like
a millennial gap year student?

629
00:45:20,053 --> 00:45:21,513
He... He's got everything, right?

630
00:45:21,597 --> 00:45:25,809
He's got the likes of hipster,
long hair, the beard, the sandals.

631
00:45:25,893 --> 00:45:27,644
He looks like a sort of 35-year-old man

632
00:45:27,728 --> 00:45:29,855
who still thinks the band
is gonna make it big.

633
00:45:32,524 --> 00:45:36,361
So…
Jesus, Buddha and Allah walk into a pub.

634
00:45:36,445 --> 00:45:37,446
Oh, no.

635
00:45:38,864 --> 00:45:41,491
And the mood goes like that.

636
00:45:42,451 --> 00:45:43,535
Like this actually.

637
00:45:45,162 --> 00:45:49,082
And they... they go to the bar.
They order drinks.

638
00:45:50,250 --> 00:45:54,254
Tap water for Jesus 'cause, you know,
he can turn that into wine for free.

639
00:45:54,838 --> 00:45:57,925
Diet Coke for Buddha because he's,
uh... he's watching his weight.

640
00:45:58,008 --> 00:46:01,136
And, uh, alcohol-free beer for Allah.

641
00:46:02,429 --> 00:46:04,866
- Nah, I'm done with this.
- And, uh, I'll... Really?

642
00:46:04,890 --> 00:46:08,519
Don't worry about them, guys. Don't worry.
Just, uh... Just treat them like an STD.

643
00:46:08,602 --> 00:46:10,604
If you ignore them,
they'll probably go away.

644
00:46:12,356 --> 00:46:16,360
And let me tell you,
they had a lovely time.

645
00:46:16,443 --> 00:46:18,987
They really did.
Honestly, they stayed out all night.

646
00:46:19,071 --> 00:46:21,448
Jesus got crucified
and wasn't seen for three days.

647
00:46:23,825 --> 00:46:26,828
I don't know why you guys
were worr... Why were you worried?

648
00:46:28,539 --> 00:46:31,792
Absolutely killed it tonight.
That was the best I've ever seen you.

649
00:46:32,543 --> 00:46:33,544
Hey, you were great.

650
00:46:33,627 --> 00:46:34,670
Oh, thank you.

651
00:46:34,753 --> 00:46:36,797
Hey, you were great.

652
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:38,298
And you were so relaxed as well.

653
00:46:38,382 --> 00:46:42,052
Strongest material, though, is your
"Jesus, Buddha and Allah walk into a pub."

654
00:46:42,135 --> 00:46:43,929
You need to get up there.

655
00:46:45,264 --> 00:46:47,516
So you, uh, head-in
for the nine o'clock tomorrow?

656
00:46:48,267 --> 00:46:49,518
You gonna be in?

657
00:46:49,601 --> 00:46:50,811
Nine o'clock. Nope. No.

658
00:46:51,478 --> 00:46:53,063
- No way.
- All right, mate.

659
00:46:53,146 --> 00:46:54,439
I'll see you in the week, yeah?

660
00:46:54,523 --> 00:46:56,441
Okay. Take care, bro. Thank you so much.

661
00:46:57,150 --> 00:46:58,944
- You killed it.
- Killer work.

662
00:47:16,587 --> 00:47:20,007
Wait! Oi! Hey!

663
00:47:20,090 --> 00:47:22,676
No! No! No, no, no! No!

664
00:47:22,759 --> 00:47:27,181
Help! Help me!

665
00:48:09,097 --> 00:48:12,684
Roddy, can you… check something for me?

666
00:48:12,768 --> 00:48:16,021
Not on the clock yet.
You'll need to pay my private rate.

667
00:48:16,104 --> 00:48:18,148
Yep.

668
00:48:27,074 --> 00:48:29,201
Just tell what it is
I'm looking at on there.

669
00:48:32,371 --> 00:48:34,081
- Don't touch that!
- All right.

670
00:48:42,381 --> 00:48:43,382
It's pi.

671
00:48:44,883 --> 00:48:46,593
- Is that a code?
- No. It's pi.

672
00:48:46,677 --> 00:48:48,679
Running to an infinite number of places.

673
00:48:48,762 --> 00:48:51,533
Is there anything else behind it?
Any other files on the stick? Anything?

674
00:48:51,557 --> 00:48:52,724
No. Where'd you get it?

675
00:48:52,808 --> 00:48:53,809
Hobden.

676
00:48:56,061 --> 00:48:57,479
You copied the files.

677
00:48:57,980 --> 00:48:59,791
You'd only know that if you'd looked
at it yourself.

678
00:48:59,815 --> 00:49:01,709
Well, at least I didn't need Ho
to tell me it was pi.

679
00:49:01,733 --> 00:49:04,486
Everybody needs me.
They just don't know it.

680
00:49:05,028 --> 00:49:06,572
Seems like he used it as a decoy.

681
00:49:06,655 --> 00:49:09,533
He was expecting a snatch. Cool cat.

682
00:49:10,284 --> 00:49:12,536
Thanks, Roddy. Very helpful.

683
00:49:14,872 --> 00:49:16,832
Why would he be expecting a snatch?

684
00:49:16,915 --> 00:49:17,833
I don't know.

685
00:49:17,916 --> 00:49:20,728
What do you think the Park will do
if they find out you opened a flashbox?

686
00:49:20,752 --> 00:49:22,880
Yeah, well, they're not gonna find out,
are they?

687
00:49:26,425 --> 00:49:27,467
Did it hurt?

688
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:30,095
No. Well, a bit.

689
00:49:31,805 --> 00:49:33,640
Fuck! Jesus Christ, Sid.

690
00:49:33,724 --> 00:49:35,434
Look, I know you landed here with a bump…

691
00:49:35,517 --> 00:49:38,246
- Yeah. I've still got whiplash.
- If you want to do something useful,

692
00:49:38,270 --> 00:49:40,373
you can get rid of the stinking rubbish
that's still in our office.

693
00:49:40,397 --> 00:49:43,192
Yeah, but I wanna actually be
properly useful, Sid. Don't you?

694
00:49:43,275 --> 00:49:48,071
Do something. I mean, it...
I could not be more bored if I tried, Sid.

695
00:49:48,155 --> 00:49:49,907
And I have actually tried.

696
00:49:49,990 --> 00:49:51,533
And if the Park are looking at Hobden,

697
00:49:51,617 --> 00:49:54,912
then that means there is something
finally happening here.

698
00:49:54,995 --> 00:49:57,080
Exactly. It's the Park's business,
not ours.

699
00:49:57,497 --> 00:49:59,499
Cartwright, come see this!

700
00:50:07,925 --> 00:50:09,551
- <i>Following a breaking story…</i>
- Hostage.

701
00:50:13,972 --> 00:50:15,015
Is it live?

702
00:50:15,098 --> 00:50:17,434
Popped up on a Middle East chat feed
a few hours ago.

703
00:50:17,518 --> 00:50:19,269
Media have just picked up on it.

704
00:50:19,353 --> 00:50:20,979
He's holding today's <i>Express</i>.

705
00:50:22,314 --> 00:50:23,899
Shit. He's being held here.

706
00:50:23,982 --> 00:50:27,277
<i>What appears to be here
in the heart of Britain.</i>

707
00:50:27,361 --> 00:50:30,948
<i>…recording first surfaced
this morning on social media…</i>

708
00:50:31,031 --> 00:50:33,534
<i>What we really need now is leadership.</i>

709
00:50:33,617 --> 00:50:36,328
Who's collating lists
on recently active groups?

710
00:50:36,411 --> 00:50:37,538
I am, ma'am.

711
00:50:37,621 --> 00:50:39,224
I wanted a breakdown of that
a half an hour ago.

712
00:50:39,248 --> 00:50:41,041
- Yes, ma'am.
- Home Office, ma'am.

713
00:50:41,124 --> 00:50:43,669
{\an8}<i>…and obsession with multiculturalism.</i>

714
00:50:43,752 --> 00:50:46,421
{\an8}<i>We don't stand up for our values,</i>

715
00:50:46,505 --> 00:50:49,174
<i>which leads to this
horrific situation where</i>

716
00:50:49,258 --> 00:50:53,512
{\an8}<i>Muslim fundamentalists
are bringing terror to our streets</i>

717
00:50:53,595 --> 00:50:56,098
{\an8}<i>and threatening to murder our citizens.</i>

718
00:50:56,181 --> 00:50:57,850
I don't think we should be watching this.

719
00:50:58,433 --> 00:50:59,893
What? The rest of the country is.

720
00:50:59,977 --> 00:51:02,020
Has anyone claimed responsibility yet?

721
00:51:02,104 --> 00:51:03,939
- No, no one.
- It would be ISIS, wouldn't it?

722
00:51:04,022 --> 00:51:05,649
Or one of their tribute groups.

723
00:51:06,149 --> 00:51:08,819
Well,
what the fuck's it got to do with you?

724
00:51:08,902 --> 00:51:13,615
Whatever's going on will be a job
for the real agents, not you fuckups.

725
00:51:13,699 --> 00:51:15,242
Yo, what's this?

726
00:51:15,325 --> 00:51:17,846
- Looks like a walking stick.
- Yeah, maybe he's been snatched

727
00:51:17,870 --> 00:51:19,830
by the Ramblers Association.

728
00:51:19,913 --> 00:51:21,707
No, it's an ax.

729
00:51:21,790 --> 00:51:24,126
- He's not white.
- That's why he was wearing gloves.

730
00:51:24,209 --> 00:51:26,044
- Fuck.
- Who's got him then?

731
00:51:26,128 --> 00:51:28,106
It could still be Islamists.
He could be a non-believer.

732
00:51:28,130 --> 00:51:30,191
- Maybe he's a squaddie.
- He doesn't look like a squaddie.

733
00:51:30,215 --> 00:51:33,218
Nah, he looks Pakistani,
which to them means Muslim.

734
00:51:33,302 --> 00:51:35,679
- To who?
- Oh, you people are slow.

735
00:51:36,346 --> 00:51:40,559
Bringing you up to speed
is like trying to explain Norway to a dog.

736
00:51:40,642 --> 00:51:44,396
It'll be right-wing nationalists.
That's who's got him.

737
00:51:44,479 --> 00:51:46,523
It's the Sons of Albion
who are taking credit.

738
00:51:46,607 --> 00:51:49,818
- Christ, I hate being right.
- All right, so what do we do then?

739
00:51:49,902 --> 00:51:52,571
What we always do here.
Absolutely nothing.

740
00:51:52,654 --> 00:51:56,158
Come on. Back to your desks.
Come on, all of you. Out!

741
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:01,079
- Hobden.
- What?

742
00:52:01,747 --> 00:52:04,041
His old crew
was the British Patriotic Party.

743
00:52:04,124 --> 00:52:06,502
Yeah, but they splintered into factions.

744
00:52:06,585 --> 00:52:09,588
Yeah, but one of them might have
something to do with this. Him too.

745
00:52:10,339 --> 00:52:12,341
- Just leave it.
- News flash!

746
00:52:12,925 --> 00:52:14,343
You're gonna wanna check this out.

747
00:52:14,426 --> 00:52:16,321
<i>We are following a breaking news story.</i>

748
00:52:16,345 --> 00:52:19,389
Sunrise tomorrow,
they say they're gonna cut his head off.

749
00:52:20,057 --> 00:52:22,017
They're gonna strike a blow for Britain.

750
00:52:22,976 --> 00:52:26,355
This changes nothing. Come on. Out!

751
00:52:27,064 --> 00:52:30,400
You've all got papers to shuffle,
so why are you still in this room?

752
00:52:33,779 --> 00:52:38,283
Now, wait, all apologies.
Answer me one simple question.

753
00:52:38,951 --> 00:52:41,453
Where the fuck is River Cartwright?

754
00:00:19,687 --> 00:00:20,687
​

755
00:00:23,691 --> 00:00:24,691
