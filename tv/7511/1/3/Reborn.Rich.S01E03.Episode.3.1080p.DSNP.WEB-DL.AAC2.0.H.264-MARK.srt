1
00:01:02,249 --> 00:01:04,149
You got the answer,

2
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:08,190
so you deserve the prize.

3
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:09,720
I don't need money.

4
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:13,559
Once I am old enough to use that money,

5
00:01:13,559 --> 00:01:15,459
its monetary value would have dropped.

6
00:01:18,199 --> 00:01:19,199
Is that so?

7
00:01:19,869 --> 00:01:21,169
I'd like land.

8
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:25,039
A place with lots of plants and trees.

9
00:01:31,009 --> 00:01:33,380
I like this area, right here.

10
00:01:35,919 --> 00:01:39,889
That land was used to make pottery. It's useless.

11
00:01:39,889 --> 00:01:41,220
(Gyeonggi Province, Seongnam, Bundang-dong)

12
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:43,370
Do you want the land in Bundang that badly?

13
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,699
Let's see.

14
00:01:50,229 --> 00:01:51,729
How does 160,000m² sound?

15
00:01:51,729 --> 00:01:53,500
(Gyeonggi Province, Seongnam, Bundang-dong)

16
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:57,169
This small village will become a new city,

17
00:01:57,169 --> 00:01:59,009
home to 390,000 people.

18
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:01,779
According to the government's New Town development plan,

19
00:02:01,779 --> 00:02:03,410
on Seongnam's Bundang area,

20
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:06,250
about 105,000 medium to large apartment blocks will be built.

21
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:09,350
They will reduce the burden on Gangnam's housing demand...

22
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:11,919
by housing 420,000 people.

23
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:14,919
What an incredible change this place went through.

24
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,430
There was just one reservoir...

25
00:02:19,359 --> 00:02:22,959
with fields and rice paddies reaching the horizons.

26
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:26,030
People say that Bundang...

27
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,150
is the next best place to live, second to paradise.

28
00:02:32,739 --> 00:02:34,280
Did you know then...

29
00:02:35,979 --> 00:02:37,929
that this place would become like this?

30
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,680
Do you simply have good discernment?

31
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:45,850
Or are you just lucky?

32
00:02:48,889 --> 00:02:52,090
I owe it to a grandfather who gifted me 160,000m² of land.

33
00:02:53,329 --> 00:02:55,959
Not anyone gets to be born your grandson.

34
00:02:57,970 --> 00:02:59,269
Does that make me lucky?

35
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:02,239
From the land here,

36
00:03:02,799 --> 00:03:05,739
do you know how much you made?

37
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,049
Welcome, sir.

38
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:15,979
This way, please.

39
00:03:21,859 --> 00:03:24,530
The 24 billion won you asked for.

40
00:03:25,259 --> 00:03:26,289
Good.

41
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:37,420
The compensation for the purchase of land was 14 billion.

42
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:41,309
Ten billion was from selling the nearby commercial land.

43
00:03:42,209 --> 00:03:44,039
A total of 24 billion won...

44
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:47,079
is what you earned.

45
00:03:51,419 --> 00:03:53,049
Would you like to count it out?

46
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:11,570
How will you manage to spend all this?

47
00:04:12,739 --> 00:04:15,209
If you buy books with it,

48
00:04:15,209 --> 00:04:17,139
you'll never read them all in your lifetime.

49
00:04:17,139 --> 00:04:18,810
If you spend it on tuition,

50
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:22,019
you'll have to get a hundred degrees.

51
00:04:23,149 --> 00:04:25,019
If you're afraid, leave it with me.

52
00:04:25,889 --> 00:04:28,239
I'll pay you more in interest than a bank does.

53
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:39,570
(Reborn Rich)

54
00:04:43,269 --> 00:04:46,440
Do Jun is still a kid, isn't he?

55
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,680
It's only natural.

56
00:04:48,709 --> 00:04:51,209
Where could he have seen such a huge amount?

57
00:04:52,149 --> 00:04:55,480
Sir, Hangang Bank's Namdaemun Branch called.

58
00:04:56,849 --> 00:05:00,250
Do Jun has exchanged the money in the account into dollars.

59
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:06,659
Shouldn't you ask him what it's for?

60
00:05:09,899 --> 00:05:11,599
He may be clever,

61
00:05:11,599 --> 00:05:14,839
but it's too much money for a 20-year-old.

62
00:05:16,269 --> 00:05:19,740
Does money choose people depending on their age?

63
00:05:22,339 --> 00:05:25,349
Let's find out if Do Jun...

64
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:27,980
is a fortunate boy,

65
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:30,250
or a boy with foresight.

66
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:33,149
It's just luck.

67
00:05:33,949 --> 00:05:36,120
How else can you explain it?

68
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:39,490
What could a little boy know about real estate...

69
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:41,199
that he'd ask for land in Bundang?

70
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:47,000
No one can beat someone with great luck.

71
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,750
Doesn't that make him even scarier?

72
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:52,610
What does Father say almost every day?

73
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:55,339
You don't become rich by working hard.

74
00:05:55,339 --> 00:05:56,680
It's up to the heavens.

75
00:05:57,610 --> 00:05:59,949
Do Jun made 24 billion won...

76
00:05:59,949 --> 00:06:01,779
by just pointing at a map.

77
00:06:03,149 --> 00:06:04,449
Father could think...

78
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,449
his youngest grandson is blessed.

79
00:06:07,449 --> 00:06:08,490
Wait.

80
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:14,459
Is that why? Isn't it weird?

81
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:18,029
Dad gave that massive sum to a kid who just started college...

82
00:06:18,029 --> 00:06:19,969
and let him manage it himself.

83
00:06:19,969 --> 00:06:21,800
He's not that kind of person.

84
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,240
He never let us do anything like that.

85
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:29,139
Not even Seong Jun, his eldest grandson.

86
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:33,310
Right?

87
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:42,019
Seong Jun is the eldest heir,

88
00:06:42,019 --> 00:06:44,360
and he was exiled in the name of study.

89
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:47,529
Why does Father play favorites with the youngest, Do Jun?

90
00:06:47,529 --> 00:06:48,630
That money.

91
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,600
It's the price of our father's life.

92
00:06:55,139 --> 00:06:56,599
If not for Do Jun,

93
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,009
when the plane exploded in midair,

94
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:03,180
Father would've died in it.

95
00:07:05,849 --> 00:07:09,449
Who cares if it's 24 billion or 240 billion?

96
00:07:10,019 --> 00:07:11,569
It's too early for such a fuss.

97
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,190
Don't you feel ashamed?

98
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:22,459
You're jealous about a 20-year-old boy's allowance.

99
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:27,199
You're grown-up adults.

100
00:07:28,599 --> 00:07:30,240
Do you really think so?

101
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:33,839
That it's allowance?

102
00:07:34,779 --> 00:07:36,240
That it's a simple gift?

103
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,420
It could be a test.

104
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:48,519
Father could be testing the boy with plans on picking a successor.

105
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:03,839
What is it that I am

106
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:08,980
Trying to look for?

107
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:14,180
Where to is it that I am

108
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:18,849
Flowing so endlessly?

109
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:22,759
The upcoming New York Film Market.

110
00:08:24,089 --> 00:08:25,990
Take me with you, Father.

111
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:27,159
To the Film Market?

112
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:29,500
I got into university,

113
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:32,399
but I have lots of time until the semester starts.

114
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,000
I'd like to travel,

115
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,670
and maybe do some advising on what films you should invest in.

116
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:40,110
You'll be an investment advisor?

117
00:08:41,209 --> 00:08:42,579
You know I have a good eye.

118
00:08:43,579 --> 00:08:46,609
I think I'm the one who got you this office.

119
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:52,089
I must release this movie on Christmas at all costs?

120
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,119
Do Jun.

121
00:08:57,119 --> 00:09:00,359
You're still young and don't know about movies.

122
00:09:00,359 --> 00:09:04,129
Christmas movies are for families.

123
00:09:04,129 --> 00:09:06,930
Who'd want to watch a gloomy movie about a kid...

124
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:09,499
left alone at home while his family went traveling?

125
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:12,739
And you still...

126
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:15,410
want me to import this movie?

127
00:09:20,449 --> 00:09:25,050
So you want to go to the New York Film Market?

128
00:09:26,489 --> 00:09:28,660
Yes. Who knows?

129
00:09:30,219 --> 00:09:32,319
This time, it might not be just an office.

130
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:35,430
Perhaps I could buy you a whole building.

131
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:38,199
There was no me anymore

132
00:09:38,199 --> 00:09:42,940
We are still young We still have a nice future

133
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:45,810
Now wipe up your cold tears

134
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:47,410
Come back home

135
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:49,739
Let's go home now.

136
00:09:49,739 --> 00:09:51,810
- You go ahead.
- Come with me.

137
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:54,180
I'm not Seo Tai Ji.

138
00:09:55,449 --> 00:09:57,180
Oh, gosh...

139
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,489
- Hey, Do Jun.
- What?

140
00:09:59,119 --> 00:10:01,020
Just because you got into law top of the class,

141
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:02,619
don't get fancy and have dreams...

142
00:10:02,619 --> 00:10:05,829
of passing the bar while you're still in college.

143
00:10:05,829 --> 00:10:07,190
What?

144
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:09,199
Play. Have fun.

145
00:10:09,199 --> 00:10:12,829
Go on group blind dates, regular blind dates, casual dates,

146
00:10:12,829 --> 00:10:14,499
- and go out with someone.
- Hang on.

147
00:10:14,499 --> 00:10:15,999
Are they all different?

148
00:10:16,969 --> 00:10:20,040
Are they the same, then? They have different terms.

149
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,209
Don't do that.

150
00:10:23,209 --> 00:10:26,550
Don't make the face of a man who already lived a lifetime.

151
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:28,219
- What?
- Don't do that either.

152
00:10:28,219 --> 00:10:29,619
- I'll do it.
- Go away.

153
00:10:29,619 --> 00:10:31,249
Wait, what's that?

154
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:34,660
- No way.
- What do we do now?

155
00:10:35,359 --> 00:10:36,859
What is it?

156
00:10:36,859 --> 00:10:38,030
Excuse me.

157
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:40,229
- They'd caused a fuss...
- Excuse me.

158
00:10:40,229 --> 00:10:42,560
- Coming through.
- Sorry.

159
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,430
- They announced their retirement.
- What is it?

160
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:48,969
As of today, January 31, 1996...

161
00:10:48,969 --> 00:10:51,270
Are they disbanding or retiring?

162
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:53,369
They're retiring.

163
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:03,020
- Oh, no...
- Jeez.

164
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:05,820
(Seo Min Yeong)

165
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,890
Why are they retiring?

166
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:09,119
My loves.

167

They're retiring because the pain of creating music is too much.

(Seo Min Yeong)

169
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:47,359
What's this?

170
00:11:47,359 --> 00:11:50,129
This is a look I've never seen on your face.

171
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:53,170
I can't believe that's her face when she was 20.

172
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:56,770
Do you know her?

173
00:11:56,770 --> 00:11:58,369
Did you meet her? When?

174
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:00,010
What?

175
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:02,440
Oh...

176
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:05,910
In 20 years' time.

177
00:12:09,849 --> 00:12:10,979
"In 20 years' time."

178
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,849
He's at it again.

179
00:12:12,849 --> 00:12:14,349
Move, mister.

180
00:12:14,349 --> 00:12:15,920
- Move.
- Okay.

181
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,620
- I can't see.
- I'm not a mister.

182
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:25,329
Chang Je, are you getting old?

183
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:29,369
You shouldn't be up this early. What's going on?

184
00:12:29,369 --> 00:12:30,839
Why are you coming to see me?

185
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:34,410
Take a look at this, Father.

186
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,830
(Seoul District Public Prosecutors' Office)

187
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,089
(Report on Special Investigation into Hando Steel)

188
00:12:45,089 --> 00:12:48,560
I don't think Hando Steel will last a month.

189
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,760
It's a great chance to buy it up cheap.

190
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,129
They took out too many loans to try to expand.

191
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:55,930
If you underwrite Hando Steel now,

192
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:58,930
wouldn't it help subsidiaries that use steel...

193
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:02,869
such as Soonyang Heavy Machinery, Motors, and Machinery?

194
00:13:02,869 --> 00:13:07,510
How will they handle this much debt?

195
00:13:08,379 --> 00:13:10,579
If the government vouches for us,

196
00:13:10,579 --> 00:13:13,479
we can extend the repayment deadline to suit us.

197
00:13:16,119 --> 00:13:17,949
Can we trust President YS?

198
00:13:17,949 --> 00:13:20,390
If Hando Group were to break up now,

199
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:22,359
it would cause huge turmoil.

200
00:13:22,359 --> 00:13:24,790
The President would want to prevent the worst.

201
00:13:27,589 --> 00:13:29,430
Having a prosecutor son-in-law...

202
00:13:30,329 --> 00:13:31,670
is so reassuring.

203
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:34,469
I thought I should give you...

204
00:13:34,469 --> 00:13:37,339
one last gift while I still work there.

205
00:13:37,339 --> 00:13:38,839
What?

206
00:13:38,839 --> 00:13:41,040
Are you going to start a law firm?

207
00:13:42,609 --> 00:13:44,510
Before the general election in April,

208
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:47,280
the President will recruit talent to join his party.

209
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:51,390
I'd love to join as a legal advisor and run for office.

210
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:53,190
The National Assembly is on an island.

211
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:56,660
It'll be very windy out there. Do you want to get into politics?

212
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,829
You can give me a sail.

213
00:13:59,829 --> 00:14:02,530
I want to venture into bigger waters for Soonyang.

214
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:09,339
I'll see...

215
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:14,339
if my son-in-law's ship can survive the sea.

216
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:18,879
I'll do my best not to let you down, Father.

217
00:14:44,869 --> 00:14:47,410
Something that dreamy would never happen.

218
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:53,150
One day, will a Korean movie ever beat Hollywood movies...

219
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:56,379
to win Best Picture at the Academy Awards?

220
00:14:56,379 --> 00:15:00,320
That's something out of a sci-fi cartoon that makes me emotional.

221
00:15:01,959 --> 00:15:03,660
It won't be easy.

222
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:07,229
The Academy Awards tend to snuff non-English movies.

223
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:10,859
I'm too imaginative.

224
00:15:10,859 --> 00:15:12,300
If that day comes,

225
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,850
a Korean song might even reach Billboard's Top 100.

226
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:18,869
I know.

227
00:15:18,869 --> 00:15:20,609
What I'm saying is as likely as Team Korea...

228
00:15:20,609 --> 00:15:22,909
reaching the semifinals of the FIFA World Cup.

229
00:15:23,739 --> 00:15:25,379
Can't a man dream?

230
00:15:25,379 --> 00:15:26,979
Don't you know dreams come true?

231
00:15:27,609 --> 00:15:30,119
Darn you. Wait up, Dad.

232
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:35,020
Yes.

233
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:37,260
Dreams do come true.

234
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:45,629
- Oh.
- I'm sorry.

235
00:15:45,629 --> 00:15:48,739
What the... This is just not fair.

236
00:15:50,239 --> 00:15:51,300
Darn it.

237
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,510
Are you Korean?

238
00:15:58,209 --> 00:15:59,249
Shoot.

239
00:16:04,449 --> 00:16:06,550
If you mean nationality, no.

240
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:09,020
If you mean where I was born, yes.

241
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:11,060
We're halfway around the world.

242
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:13,560
You're not expecting a friendly hug, are you?

243
00:16:14,329 --> 00:16:15,629
Look.

244
00:16:15,629 --> 00:16:19,469
Because of you, I just became the investor...

245
00:16:19,469 --> 00:16:22,800
with the most rotten luck in the whole of this market.

246
00:16:23,339 --> 00:16:24,839
Oh, then...

247
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,670
I'm truly sorry.

248
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:29,810
I'll pay you for the donut.

249
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:33,010
- How much do you want?
- Ten million dollars!

250
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:36,520
Ten million dollars?

251
00:16:38,589 --> 00:16:40,290
What are you talking about?

252
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:42,560
One donut costs ten million dollars?

253
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:46,129
I always eat a donut before I decide what to invest in.

254
00:16:46,129 --> 00:16:48,060
I've never broken it once.

255
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:50,129
It's a principle, routine, and jinx. Anyway,

256
00:16:50,129 --> 00:16:51,770
it's my most important, necessary,

257
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:53,670
and sufficient condition of investing.

258
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:57,440
This donut is from a shop in Midtown that's 30 minutes from here.

259
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,010
And I have just ten minutes to decide what to invest in.

260
00:17:01,609 --> 00:17:02,979
Without a donut,

261
00:17:02,979 --> 00:17:06,379
in this market where ten million dollars will change hands,

262
00:17:06,379 --> 00:17:07,810
because of clumsy you.

263
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:10,379
You'll pay me back?

264
00:17:11,149 --> 00:17:14,689
This donut cost a dollar, but it's worth ten million to me.

265
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:16,589
How much will you pay me?

266
00:17:20,859 --> 00:17:22,159
Never bet on things...

267
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:24,899
that you aren't sure about.

268
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:27,470
Do you get that?

269
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:32,010
That...

270
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,990
Do Jun! We're over here.

271
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:46,419
Okay. I'm coming.

272
00:17:49,619 --> 00:17:50,689
What a weirdo.

273
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:01,129
"Titanic."

274
00:18:01,129 --> 00:18:04,500
The "Titanic" fever is going strong.

275
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:09,179
Nominated for 14 Academy Awards, the most in Academy history,

276
00:18:09,179 --> 00:18:11,480
at the 70th Academy Awards...

277
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,450
I should invest in "Titanic?"

278
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:14,980
Yes.

279
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:17,649
Not for import or distribution rights...

280
00:18:17,649 --> 00:18:19,250
but the production?

281
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:20,849
Yes.

282
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:25,460
That way, you get a part of the massive profit.

283
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:26,659
It goes here.

284
00:18:26,659 --> 00:18:28,189
There are three arches.

285
00:18:28,189 --> 00:18:29,300
- Shall we bet?
- Yes.

286
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:33,230
Do Jun. The reason you wanted to come here...

287
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:35,930
was because you had this movie in mind from the start?

288
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:43,310
Hey. Look, Father.

289
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:45,810
My gosh.

290
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:49,220
Wow. Nice.

291
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:55,490
Are you convinced it will be a hit?

292
00:18:56,189 --> 00:18:57,919
Like "Home Alone" last time?

293
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:04,000
You know I have a good hunch.

294
00:19:05,169 --> 00:19:06,369
Trust me again.

295
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,500
A hunch?

296
00:19:12,939 --> 00:19:15,379
Father. I have a scientific...

297
00:19:15,379 --> 00:19:18,109
and logical reason this movie will flop.

298
00:19:18,109 --> 00:19:19,379
It'll shock you.

299
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:23,849
Blockbusters involving water...

300
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:27,149
are bound to flop.

301
00:19:27,149 --> 00:19:28,220
Why?

302
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,929
Because the project sinks.

303
00:19:34,659 --> 00:19:35,730
What?

304
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:38,669
"Cutthroat Island," "Waterworld,"

305
00:19:38,669 --> 00:19:43,439
and serial hit-maker James Cameron's only flop "The Abyss."

306
00:19:43,439 --> 00:19:46,169
They're all about water, and they all tanked.

307
00:19:46,169 --> 00:19:48,980
This is a science.

308
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:51,179
Boss, you need to think this over.

309
00:19:51,179 --> 00:19:52,679
You have to think this over.

310
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:54,379
You would've never made this decision...

311
00:19:54,379 --> 00:19:56,480
if you didn't drop that darn donut.

312
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,349
Ten million dollars into the "Titanic?"

313
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:01,820
Why don't you take that ten million dollars...

314
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:03,960
and just throw it into the Atlantic Ocean?

315
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,159
Will you still invest in "Titanic?"

316
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:10,000
Come on. You didn't even watch "Waterworld."

317
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,129
I couldn't.

318
00:20:11,129 --> 00:20:12,200
DiCaprio?

319
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:14,369
DiCaprio?

320
00:20:14,369 --> 00:20:16,339
Who on earth will do the acting?

321
00:20:16,339 --> 00:20:19,109
And the woman who looks like his aunt.

322
00:20:19,109 --> 00:20:21,070
Do Koreans even know who she is?

323
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:23,210
Do you know her? I don't know her.

324
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:26,010
- No Brad Pitt or Tom Cruise.
- They're Korean.

325
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:28,250
A blockbuster with zero stars?

326
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:30,849
Do you really think this will work, boss?

327
00:20:31,619 --> 00:20:32,889
"Titanic."

328
00:20:32,889 --> 00:20:35,520
It's about a luxury cruise ship that's only for the rich...

329
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,359
sinking in a gruesome manner in the middle of nowhere.

330
00:20:38,359 --> 00:20:39,990
It's about the rich losing out.

331
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:42,000
People have no choice but to flock to the cinemas.

332
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,150
Why? Because it'll never happen in reality.

333
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,869
Did you hear that?

334
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,770
She looks like DiCaprio's aunt?

335
00:20:49,669 --> 00:20:53,270
She's the real reason I want to invest in this movie.

336
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:54,310
What?

337
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:55,839
In a recession like this,

338
00:20:55,839 --> 00:20:58,679
the public care very little for cute, young starlets.

339
00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:01,179
They prefer mature actresses with an intellectual air...

340
00:21:01,179 --> 00:21:02,919
to be their heroine.

341
00:21:02,919 --> 00:21:05,320
Kate Winslet has that face.

342
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,849
They spent an enormous amount of money to make the movie.

343
00:21:07,849 --> 00:21:11,089
It won't be profitable unless it becomes an international hit.

344
00:21:11,089 --> 00:21:12,990
Following Europe,

345
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:14,990
countries in East Asia are building multiplex theaters too.

346
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:17,460
The number of moviegoers will increase exponentially.

347
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:20,169
And naturally, the profitability will go up as well.

348
00:21:20,169 --> 00:21:23,069
You know what a low-price high-volume policy means, right?

349
00:21:23,939 --> 00:21:25,740
Are you confident?

350
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:28,109
Can I guarantee that the movie will be a hit?

351
00:21:28,109 --> 00:21:29,780
Then my answer is no. However,

352
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,849
if it's about recovering the investment...

353
00:21:31,849 --> 00:21:35,010
and securing stable profitability... Yes.

354
00:21:35,579 --> 00:21:39,020
- He's right.
- I'm very rational now, Rachael.

355
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:42,960
I said I dropped the donut.

356
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:46,159
I never said I didn't eat it.

357
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:47,189
What?

358
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,570
"Based on scientific evidence..."

359
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,899
is what I'd say in a situation like this.

360
00:21:57,899 --> 00:22:00,070
- Hey!
- How's it going?

361
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:01,439
- I'm good.
- Yes.

362
00:22:01,439 --> 00:22:02,810
Are you going to invest in this?

363
00:22:02,810 --> 00:22:04,740
- That's what I'm thinking about.
- What about you?

364
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,250
- I'm investing...
- Do you have anything in mind?

365
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:08,079
- Power Shares?
- Yes, I have...

366
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:20,560
Mason Oh.

367
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:24,260
His Korean name is Oh Se Hyeon.

368
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,470
Power Shares.

369
00:22:29,369 --> 00:22:31,939
The director and head of APAC at Power Shares.

370
00:22:41,349 --> 00:22:43,050
Hi, good afternoon.

371
00:22:43,050 --> 00:22:44,320
Hi, may I help you?

372
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,849
Yes. I'm Jin.

373
00:22:46,849 --> 00:22:48,990
I'm here to see Mason Oh.

374
00:22:50,659 --> 00:22:53,790
- I got twenty on Kasparov.
- Fifty on Kasparov.

375
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:55,399
We're nuts for doing this.

376
00:22:55,399 --> 00:22:57,800
I want to put... If you guys let me get in on...

377
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,639
I'm surprised to see you here. I thought...

378
00:23:02,639 --> 00:23:04,789
you'd been in a business meeting somewhere.

379
00:23:09,939 --> 00:23:11,810
Thanks to you,

380
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:15,919
I became the luckiest investor on Wall Street today.

381
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:18,079
Here's your delicious cheese pizza.

382
00:23:19,419 --> 00:23:20,919
Enjoy your meal.

383
00:23:20,919 --> 00:23:22,189
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

384
00:23:35,399 --> 00:23:36,599
What's that guy doing?

385
00:23:37,399 --> 00:23:38,740
Is he crazy or something?

386
00:23:43,409 --> 00:23:46,310
Maybe you should order something else.

387
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:48,950
Darn it. This is so good.

388
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:52,320
This is the best cheese I've ever had.

389
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:56,659
I should've bought some shares in this cheese company back then.

390
00:23:56,659 --> 00:23:57,889
It's too late now.

391
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:00,929
Darn, it's so good.

392
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,869
Hey, you. I wanted to say something earlier.

393
00:24:05,869 --> 00:24:08,899
I am working right now.

394
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:12,339
Leave me alone, will you? Don't disturb me.

395
00:24:16,179 --> 00:24:17,980
Well, that's the right move, by the way.

396
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:20,280
- Oh.
- Yes, that is the right move.

397
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:22,349
That was absolutely amazing.

398
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:25,550
The supercomputer Deep Blue...

399
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:29,490
versus Kasparov, the chess champion.

400
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,460
What a strange world we live in.

401
00:24:34,429 --> 00:24:36,929
Even a computer has a name?

402
00:24:36,929 --> 00:24:38,829
Hyeon Woo, what was it called?

403
00:24:38,829 --> 00:24:42,200
You know, that computer. Blue... What was it?

404
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,000
Dad!

405
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,369
- Dad!
- What is it, son?

406
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,439
- Wow.
- Why? Who won?

407
00:24:48,439 --> 00:24:50,579
My gosh. Unbelievable.

408
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,780
Who do you think will win?

409
00:24:57,619 --> 00:24:59,919
The supercomputer Deep Blue?

410
00:25:00,649 --> 00:25:03,859
Or Garry Kasparov, the chess champion?

411
00:25:04,619 --> 00:25:05,629
Who?

412
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:09,060
Well...

413
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:10,599
Everyone says it's the game of the century...

414
00:25:10,599 --> 00:25:12,329
between a human and a computer.

415
00:25:12,329 --> 00:25:14,729
But that's not what you're interested in, right?

416
00:25:16,899 --> 00:25:20,339
"What is the company value of IBM, the company that made Deep Blue?"

417
00:25:20,339 --> 00:25:23,339
"When and how much should I buy in to maximize my profit?"

418
00:25:23,339 --> 00:25:26,679
That's why you're so engrossed in the match. Am I right?

419
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:30,919
I'll tell you who will win.

420
00:25:30,919 --> 00:25:34,649
In turn, spare me your time.

421
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:38,820
You can tell me who will win when the match is still going on?

422
00:25:42,599 --> 00:25:44,000
Deep Blue will win.

423
00:25:44,730 --> 00:25:47,169
Invest in IBM, before this round ends.

424
00:25:50,669 --> 00:25:51,740
Can I have a piece?

425
00:25:55,579 --> 00:26:00,450
Well, chances are... It's 50-50 anyway.

426
00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:03,679
I guess you're relying on luck. Too bad.

427
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:06,790
Deep Blue hasn't overcome the limitations of AI.

428
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:09,440
Even the engineers and developers at IBM admitted it.

429
00:26:10,189 --> 00:26:13,829
But you think Deep Blue will beat Kasparov, the genius player?

430
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:18,000
Deep Blue has less than a 20-percent chance to win.

431
00:26:18,899 --> 00:26:21,530
That's what all experts say. Hey, young man.

432
00:26:22,869 --> 00:26:26,409
Never bet on things that you aren't sure about.

433
00:26:27,609 --> 00:26:30,259
I never rely on luck when it comes to my investments.

434
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:45,629
When the game ends,

435
00:26:46,829 --> 00:26:50,500
you'll want to meet me.

436
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:55,470
I'm confident.

437
00:26:56,639 --> 00:26:59,369
I'm 100 percent sure that Deep Blue will win.

438
00:26:59,369 --> 00:27:00,609
Hey, go away.

439
00:27:12,189 --> 00:27:13,550
Oh, my gosh!

440
00:27:14,419 --> 00:27:15,919
- No problem!
- Yes!

441
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:19,730
- I can't believe it.
- Thank you, gentlemen. Sorry, man.

442
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:21,290
What? Deep Blue won?

443
00:27:23,159 --> 00:27:26,109
A supercomputer beat a human for the first time in history?

444
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:54,460
That was a fluke, right?

445
00:28:01,703 --> 00:28:03,032
How did you guess it?

446
00:28:04,103 --> 00:28:06,673
None of the experts on Wall Street...

447
00:28:06,673 --> 00:28:09,812
predicted that Deep Blue would win.

448
00:28:15,413 --> 00:28:16,563
I trusted my instincts.

449
00:28:17,512 --> 00:28:18,513
What?

450
00:28:18,513 --> 00:28:20,853
Had Kasparov been a mere player,

451
00:28:21,853 --> 00:28:24,322
Deep Blue wouldn't have stood a chance against him.

452
00:28:24,322 --> 00:28:27,462
However, I bet Kasparov, the genius chess player...

453
00:28:27,462 --> 00:28:30,362
who's kept the world champion title for the past 20 years,

454
00:28:30,992 --> 00:28:32,603
wanted to make history.

455
00:28:34,133 --> 00:28:36,203
"Fought against AI and won,"

456
00:28:36,203 --> 00:28:38,302
"thus protecting the pride of mankind."

457
00:28:39,173 --> 00:28:41,443
He probably wanted a title like that.

458
00:28:41,443 --> 00:28:45,212
And greed...

459
00:28:45,212 --> 00:28:47,542
always clouds your judgment.

460
00:28:50,482 --> 00:28:51,683
Not bad.

461
00:28:56,052 --> 00:28:58,152
I'd like to invest in companies in the US.

462
00:28:59,962 --> 00:29:03,462
Relying on your instincts, knowing how risky that can be?

463
00:29:04,562 --> 00:29:06,002
I have you.

464
00:29:06,663 --> 00:29:09,873
Use numbers to help me prove that my instincts are on point.

465
00:29:11,133 --> 00:29:12,873
I'm a busy man, you see.

466
00:29:14,242 --> 00:29:15,673
Enjoy the rest of your trip.

467
00:29:17,472 --> 00:29:20,242
With accurate data, which is essential for investing.

468
00:29:20,242 --> 00:29:24,252
And with cash.

469
00:29:25,782 --> 00:29:27,822
Do you know that the minimum amount we require...

470
00:29:27,822 --> 00:29:30,423
is 30,000 dollars (30 million won)?

471
00:29:31,522 --> 00:29:33,292
I have a lot of money, Mr. Oh.

472
00:29:33,292 --> 00:29:36,562
Save up as much as you can before you join the military.

473
00:29:37,093 --> 00:29:38,363
Enjoy your trip. Bye.

474
00:29:45,103 --> 00:29:47,472
(Jeongsimjae)

475
00:29:53,143 --> 00:29:54,943
As for Hando Steel, we're estimating...

476
00:29:54,943 --> 00:29:56,883
that it'd cost us about 500 billion won.

477
00:29:56,883 --> 00:30:00,322
So we'll go penniless after this deal.

478
00:30:01,353 --> 00:30:03,193
Do they have something we could use to make money?

479
00:30:03,193 --> 00:30:06,262
Hando Steel owns a warehouse in Busan.

480
00:30:06,262 --> 00:30:08,222
If we make sure the creditors can't touch it...

481
00:30:08,222 --> 00:30:10,732
and build an apartment complex in that lot,

482
00:30:10,732 --> 00:30:13,382
we should be able to earn back the money fairly soon.

483
00:30:14,032 --> 00:30:16,682
Sir, we've encountered an unexpected variable though.

484
00:30:17,373 --> 00:30:21,002
Daeyoung Group is getting ready to bid on Hando Steel too.

485
00:30:21,002 --> 00:30:24,042
The Secretary's Office informed me this morning.

486
00:30:24,042 --> 00:30:26,542
Then it means Daeyoung will bid on it for sure.

487
00:30:26,542 --> 00:30:29,853
Our Secretary's Office obtains intel before the NSP does.

488
00:30:29,853 --> 00:30:31,913
Right, Daeyoung makes cars, heavy equipment,

489
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:33,752
and even ships.

490
00:30:33,752 --> 00:30:36,593
No wonder they want to buy a steel-producing company.

491
00:30:36,593 --> 00:30:38,923
To beat Daeyoung,

492
00:30:39,762 --> 00:30:42,833
we'd need at least 400 billion won. Don't you think?

493
00:30:42,833 --> 00:30:44,933
It's not even a lucrative deal.

494
00:30:45,903 --> 00:30:49,633
Then should we forget about Hando Steel altogether?

495
00:30:49,633 --> 00:30:52,032
I will not let Daeyoung acquire Hando Steel.

496
00:30:53,843 --> 00:30:57,113
And the maximum amount we'll spend on this is 300 billion.

497
00:30:57,113 --> 00:30:59,413
We won't spend a penny more.

498
00:30:59,982 --> 00:31:01,343
Then how...

499
00:31:04,653 --> 00:31:06,123
Why are you asking me?

500
00:31:08,883 --> 00:31:10,283
- Vice-Chairman.
- Yes, sir.

501
00:31:11,123 --> 00:31:14,893
Go make sure we can acquire Hando Steel.

502
00:31:14,893 --> 00:31:15,992
Pardon?

503
00:31:18,133 --> 00:31:19,483
Why? Are you not confident?

504
00:31:20,262 --> 00:31:22,312
Then step down. Why are you sitting here?

505
00:31:27,472 --> 00:31:28,502
What will you do?

506
00:31:30,913 --> 00:31:34,643
My goodness. Thanks. This looks delicious.

507
00:31:35,683 --> 00:31:39,322
Do Jun, you're such a perfect grandson.

508
00:31:39,322 --> 00:31:41,083
You came all the way here...

509
00:31:41,083 --> 00:31:44,893
to see your grandparents after your trip to the US.

510
00:31:44,893 --> 00:31:46,893
Just like your father, you're handsome,

511
00:31:46,893 --> 00:31:49,593
smart, and sweet.

512
00:31:50,492 --> 00:31:51,833
Right, Jeong Rae?

513
00:31:52,393 --> 00:31:54,962
I'd say he got his looks from his mother.

514
00:31:55,732 --> 00:31:58,333
As for his brain... I don't know.

515
00:32:00,972 --> 00:32:04,373
Use your smart brain to follow in your grandpa's footsteps...

516
00:32:04,373 --> 00:32:07,312
and grow the company.

517
00:32:08,443 --> 00:32:09,982
Why not study management?

518
00:32:09,982 --> 00:32:13,353
Why would you suddenly want to go to law school?

519
00:32:14,482 --> 00:32:16,492
He takes after his father,

520
00:32:16,492 --> 00:32:21,193
so I guess he has no interest in running a business whatsoever.

521
00:32:21,193 --> 00:32:22,222
Right, Do Jun?

522
00:32:24,532 --> 00:32:26,363
If I study law,

523
00:32:26,363 --> 00:32:29,002
I can be more helpful to Grandpa and his business.

524
00:32:29,732 --> 00:32:31,173
Really?

525
00:32:31,173 --> 00:32:35,072
My gosh. Is that why you decided to study law, Do Jun?

526
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:38,943
Grandma, I'm still in my first year.

527
00:32:40,883 --> 00:32:44,353
At the moment, I just want to play and not think about anything.

528
00:32:45,052 --> 00:32:47,322
Yes! Just play.

529
00:32:47,322 --> 00:32:49,792
That's what you should do when you're in your first year.

530
00:32:49,792 --> 00:32:51,252
Meet some girls too, okay?

531
00:32:51,252 --> 00:32:52,492
The board meeting is over.

532
00:32:52,492 --> 00:32:54,292
I see. You can go upstairs now, Do Jun.

533
00:32:54,292 --> 00:32:55,762
Okay, Grandma.

534
00:32:55,762 --> 00:32:57,732
- Thank you.
- Just play!

535
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:02,403
Goodness, that old man is awfully stubborn.

536
00:33:03,403 --> 00:33:05,972
Acquire Hando Steel, but don't spend money.

537
00:33:05,972 --> 00:33:09,143
What are we supposed to do, then?

538
00:33:12,782 --> 00:33:13,843
Right, Young Ki?

539
00:33:23,123 --> 00:33:24,853
Do Jun, you're back!

540
00:33:27,423 --> 00:33:29,333
You little rascal.

541
00:33:30,492 --> 00:33:33,103
Did you see lots of cool things in the US?

542
00:33:33,103 --> 00:33:35,833
- Did you eat lots of good food?
- Yes, Grandpa.

543
00:33:35,833 --> 00:33:37,103
Thanks to you...

544
00:33:38,272 --> 00:33:39,572
I had a great trip.

545
00:33:39,572 --> 00:33:40,943
Good.

546
00:33:40,943 --> 00:33:43,993
What was your favorite out of all the dishes you tried there?

547
00:33:44,712 --> 00:33:48,113
- Pardon me?
- What was your favorite dish?

548
00:33:49,613 --> 00:33:50,613
Oh.

549
00:33:56,052 --> 00:33:57,123
The donut.

550
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:06,203
That brat.

551
00:34:08,262 --> 00:34:10,703
Does he think he's Lee Mi Ja or Cho Yong Pil...

552
00:34:10,703 --> 00:34:12,742
who just returned from his concert tour in Southeast Asia?

553
00:34:12,742 --> 00:34:13,742
Goodness.

554
00:34:16,012 --> 00:34:17,643
I'm talking about Do Jun.

555
00:34:17,643 --> 00:34:20,112
He was in New York for a few days with his dad.

556
00:34:20,112 --> 00:34:23,882
And he showed up to report to Father that he's back.

557
00:34:23,882 --> 00:34:26,523
Hey. He's just 20, and he's a guy.

558
00:34:26,523 --> 00:34:28,473
Guys his age are rarely that attentive.

559
00:34:29,353 --> 00:34:31,523
I bet he has an ulterior motive.

560
00:34:32,322 --> 00:34:36,333
At age 20, he should know how to respect his elders.

561
00:34:36,333 --> 00:34:37,583
He's better than his dad.

562
00:34:39,963 --> 00:34:43,302
You're so understanding.

563
00:34:43,302 --> 00:34:45,433
You're incredibly magnanimous.

564
00:34:45,433 --> 00:34:46,442
But you see,

565
00:34:47,643 --> 00:34:49,302
did you know that Do Jun...

566
00:34:49,302 --> 00:34:51,313
exchanged the 24 billion won to US dollars before his trip?

567
00:34:51,313 --> 00:34:53,313
The price of our father's life?

568
00:34:54,942 --> 00:34:57,892
It wouldn't have been possible without Father's permission.

569
00:35:00,483 --> 00:35:02,552
He's different from his dad.

570
00:35:03,152 --> 00:35:05,753
Yoon Ki never had any interest in the company.

571
00:35:05,753 --> 00:35:08,203
But that boy is different. Just look at his eyes.

572
00:35:09,192 --> 00:35:13,262
We have to stay frosty, Young Ki.

573
00:35:16,603 --> 00:35:19,333
That it's allowance? That it's a simple gift?

574
00:35:21,942 --> 00:35:23,413
It could be a test.

575
00:35:24,172 --> 00:35:26,842
Go make sure we can acquire Hando Steel.

576
00:35:27,382 --> 00:35:31,313
Father could be testing the boy with plans on picking a successor.

577
00:35:32,313 --> 00:35:34,922
Why? Are you not confident?

578
00:35:35,623 --> 00:35:37,793
Then step down. Why are you sitting here?

579
00:35:44,563 --> 00:35:46,163
(Jin Young Ki)

580
00:35:46,163 --> 00:35:48,132
I told the Economic Research Institute...

581
00:35:48,132 --> 00:35:50,972
to prepare a report to send to Hando Steel's creditors.

582
00:35:51,733 --> 00:35:54,703
If we emphasize the number of jobs that will be created...

583
00:35:54,703 --> 00:35:57,442
when we acquire Hando Steel and the positive synergy,

584
00:35:57,442 --> 00:35:59,583
Cheongwadae will show interest too.

585
00:35:59,583 --> 00:36:02,983
Risk management is crucial as the administration is nearing its end.

586
00:36:05,583 --> 00:36:07,683
Please proceed accordingly, Mr. Lee.

587
00:36:10,492 --> 00:36:11,552
Yes, sir.

588
00:36:18,333 --> 00:36:19,333
Hang Jae.

589
00:36:30,543 --> 00:36:31,612
My old man...

590
00:36:34,043 --> 00:36:35,782
What does he want from me?

591
00:36:37,112 --> 00:36:39,052
Acquiring Hando Steel?

592
00:36:39,983 --> 00:36:41,023
Or...

593
00:36:42,953 --> 00:36:44,953
is he just not happy with anything I do?

594
00:36:46,463 --> 00:36:50,233
You know what he's thinking better than his own children do.

595
00:36:52,632 --> 00:36:53,703
Mr. Chairman...

596
00:36:55,032 --> 00:36:59,103
would like to pass Soonyang down to someone who is like him.

597
00:36:59,873 --> 00:37:01,342
And it might not be his eldest son?

598
00:37:01,342 --> 00:37:04,012
Young Ki, he is giving you a chance first...

599
00:37:04,012 --> 00:37:05,512
because you're his eldest son.

600
00:37:10,512 --> 00:37:13,152
Focus on acquiring Hando Steel.

601
00:37:14,353 --> 00:37:18,123
He wants to see the fighting spirit and persistence in you.

602
00:37:20,722 --> 00:37:22,563
To him, running a company...

603
00:37:23,333 --> 00:37:25,833
was like a never-ending war,

604
00:37:26,802 --> 00:37:29,152
where he had to kill first in order to survive.

605
00:37:35,103 --> 00:37:36,103
Sir.

606
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:39,342
As you had predicted, Vice-Chairman Jin...

607
00:37:39,342 --> 00:37:41,483
asked me what you were really thinking.

608
00:37:45,813 --> 00:37:48,353
I told him that you were giving him a chance...

609
00:37:49,083 --> 00:37:51,652
and that nothing would change...

610
00:37:51,652 --> 00:37:54,293
if he did his best to acquire Hando Steel.

611
00:37:54,963 --> 00:37:55,992
I assured him.

612
00:37:59,802 --> 00:38:01,032
Hang Jae.

613
00:38:02,463 --> 00:38:04,833
It's such a shame.

614
00:38:05,833 --> 00:38:07,273
Pardon me?

615
00:38:07,273 --> 00:38:10,643
Why were you born to your parents?

616
00:38:13,213 --> 00:38:15,442
I wish you were my son.

617
00:38:20,782 --> 00:38:22,052
Sir, didn't you know?

618
00:38:22,753 --> 00:38:26,492
I think of you as my father.

619
00:38:31,233 --> 00:38:32,283
I'll leave you to it.

620
00:38:36,103 --> 00:38:37,733
You see, Do Jun...

621
00:38:41,242 --> 00:38:43,873
His school is pretty far from where he lives.

622
00:38:46,413 --> 00:38:48,543
Send him a car.

623
00:38:49,143 --> 00:38:50,152
Yes, sir.

624
00:39:01,123 --> 00:39:04,032
Hello, I'm Ha In Seok from the Secretary's Office.

625
00:39:04,032 --> 00:39:05,463
Hello.

626
00:39:05,463 --> 00:39:07,132
Mr. Chairman sent me.

627
00:39:07,132 --> 00:39:08,433
He said your school was pretty far,

628
00:39:08,433 --> 00:39:10,333
so it must be hard for you to commute.

629
00:39:14,742 --> 00:39:16,342
I'll be your driver from now on.

630
00:39:33,192 --> 00:39:35,362
Please just drop me off in front of the gate.

631
00:39:35,362 --> 00:39:37,132
I'll walk from there.

632
00:39:37,132 --> 00:39:39,963
No, I'll drop you off in front of the lecture hall.

633
00:39:39,963 --> 00:39:42,762
Most people at school already know who I am.

634
00:39:44,132 --> 00:39:47,442
I don't want to show up with a driver and attract attention.

635
00:39:48,603 --> 00:39:50,273
It won't do Grandpa any good.

636
00:39:51,373 --> 00:39:53,382
Right, I'll remember that.

637
00:39:57,612 --> 00:39:59,512
(Seoul National University)

638
00:40:18,503 --> 00:40:21,172
I got it. I don't want to turn into a spoiled brat.

639
00:40:22,773 --> 00:40:24,373
Oh, right.

640
00:40:24,373 --> 00:40:26,273
You're done for the day.

641
00:40:26,882 --> 00:40:30,552
You're free to decide how to spend the rest of your day.

642
00:40:30,552 --> 00:40:31,552
Bye.

643
00:40:36,152 --> 00:40:38,052
- Hello!
- Come and take one!

644
00:40:38,052 --> 00:40:41,862
- Take a look at this.
- Please join us!

645
00:40:42,463 --> 00:40:43,933
- Come find us!
- Join us!

646
00:40:43,933 --> 00:40:46,132
- Hello, take one!
- Welcome!

647
00:40:46,132 --> 00:40:47,733
- Hello, welcome!
- Are you a freshman?

648
00:40:47,733 --> 00:40:49,003
- Would you be interested?
- Hi.

649
00:40:49,003 --> 00:40:50,972
Come find us!

650
00:40:50,972 --> 00:40:52,472
You should join us.

651
00:41:03,953 --> 00:41:05,953
Jin Do Jun, at the School of Law. Right?

652
00:41:11,692 --> 00:41:13,362
I study law too. I'm Kim Tae Young.

653
00:41:13,362 --> 00:41:15,362
He's Gang Nam from the Department of Journalism.

654
00:41:15,362 --> 00:41:18,592
Come on, why is the introduction so bland? It's between us.

655
00:41:21,762 --> 00:41:23,733
Tae Young's family owns Mirae Industry.

656
00:41:23,733 --> 00:41:25,833
My family owns Bando Firm.

657
00:41:25,833 --> 00:41:28,103
Ji Min's grandfather has been the Prime Minister since...

658
00:41:28,103 --> 00:41:29,172
So?

659
00:41:31,942 --> 00:41:35,742
Seong Jun must not have told you about our club, Prestigious Club.

660
00:41:36,552 --> 00:41:39,413
I did hear about it. Prestigious Club.

661
00:41:39,413 --> 00:41:42,652
You used to call me casually, but now you treat me as your senior.

662
00:41:42,652 --> 00:41:45,692
It was the center of Vice-Chairman Jin Seong Jun's connection.

663
00:41:45,692 --> 00:41:46,862
A secretive social gathering...

664
00:41:46,862 --> 00:41:48,192
of the children of prestigious families.

665
00:41:48,192 --> 00:41:51,063
You don't have to act so stiff. It's nothing much.

666
00:41:51,762 --> 00:41:55,302
We're just inviting you to have a meal with those of your class.

667
00:41:56,302 --> 00:41:58,233
People are so strange.

668
00:41:58,233 --> 00:42:02,203
They feel a sense of incongruity because of people like us.

669
00:42:02,203 --> 00:42:05,072
So what? Is that our fault?

670
00:42:05,072 --> 00:42:06,813
It's their inferior complex.

671
00:42:06,813 --> 00:42:07,983
Yes.

672
00:42:07,983 --> 00:42:10,683
What do you think, newbie?

673
00:42:10,683 --> 00:42:12,512
Enough with all the talking.

674
00:42:13,552 --> 00:42:14,583
Your number.

675
00:42:16,623 --> 00:42:20,192
Why? Do I need your grandfather's permission to get your number?

676
00:42:20,192 --> 00:42:22,592
I'll text you the location and time of your welcoming dinner.

677
00:42:22,592 --> 00:42:25,862
You know it's a must to bring a partner, right?

678
00:42:36,373 --> 00:42:37,973
I must stick to the rule, right?

679
00:42:43,012 --> 00:42:44,782
Nice!

680
00:42:45,813 --> 00:42:48,853
(Music Listening Room)

681
00:44:20,313 --> 00:44:21,583
We've met before, right?

682
00:44:27,382 --> 00:44:29,922
You look familiar. I definitely met you before.

683
00:44:30,652 --> 00:44:31,992
Where did we meet?

684
00:44:33,052 --> 00:44:35,023
You definitely have a classical taste.

685
00:44:36,992 --> 00:44:38,992
You could just invite me for a meal.

686
00:44:40,503 --> 00:44:42,703
Isn't this tactic way too classic?

687
00:44:45,672 --> 00:44:47,942
Hello, I'm not hitting on you.

688
00:44:48,572 --> 00:44:50,172
Invite you for a meal?

689
00:44:50,172 --> 00:44:51,742
- When did I...
- Here it is.

690
00:44:56,313 --> 00:44:58,263
This is what you're looking for, right?

691
00:45:13,902 --> 00:45:15,003
Let's have a meal.

692
00:45:42,492 --> 00:45:43,933
("'Hello, I'm Jin Do Jun, ' An Interview With Jin Do Jun...")

693
00:45:43,933 --> 00:45:46,632
("Who Entered Department of Law At the Top of His Class")

694
00:45:46,632 --> 00:45:47,933
There was a reason.

695
00:45:49,632 --> 00:45:52,503
Are you so confident and rude...

696
00:45:53,103 --> 00:45:54,942
because of your grandfather?

697
00:45:54,942 --> 00:45:56,402
No way.

698
00:45:57,413 --> 00:45:59,472
What's so hard about having a meal...

699
00:45:59,472 --> 00:46:01,882
with a peer in my department?

700
00:46:03,453 --> 00:46:06,683
Do I have to use my grandfather's power to eat with you?

701
00:46:10,353 --> 00:46:11,903
If you treat me to a nice meal,

702
00:46:12,692 --> 00:46:14,123
I was going to tell you...

703
00:46:14,123 --> 00:46:15,722
when Seo Tai Ji was making a comeback.

704
00:46:15,722 --> 00:46:17,272
I thought you might be curious.

705
00:46:18,293 --> 00:46:20,302
Is it fun to tease people?

706
00:46:26,072 --> 00:46:27,103
It's true, right?

707
00:46:28,703 --> 00:46:31,873
You said Soonyang's better than the CIA in getting information.

708
00:46:31,873 --> 00:46:33,882
That's how you heard it, right?

709
00:46:34,713 --> 00:46:37,813
I knew it. Is he really making a comeback?

710
00:46:38,753 --> 00:46:39,782
When?

711
00:46:42,623 --> 00:46:45,393
You're going to eat with me, right?

712
00:47:06,252 --> 00:47:09,223
She's there. Please stop here.

713
00:47:09,223 --> 00:47:10,263
Okay.

714
00:47:40,393 --> 00:47:43,163
Do you normally always wear like this?

715
00:47:50,163 --> 00:47:52,813
You're a bit different from the Seo Min Yeong I know.

716
00:47:53,402 --> 00:47:55,703
This? You're wrong.

717
00:47:56,502 --> 00:47:58,572
You must be thinking...

718
00:47:58,572 --> 00:48:01,712
that I dolled up to meet you, but...

719
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:04,482
You look better now. They're nice clothes.

720
00:48:13,223 --> 00:48:15,663
Tell me now. Is it true?

721
00:48:15,663 --> 00:48:17,362
Is he really making a comeback?

722
00:48:17,362 --> 00:48:18,462
Seo Tai Ji, I mean.

723
00:48:19,263 --> 00:48:20,533
When is he coming back?

724
00:48:23,502 --> 00:48:24,603
You...

725
00:48:25,902 --> 00:48:27,743
Do you really know?

726
00:48:29,402 --> 00:48:31,473
After 4 years. The summer of 2000.

727
00:48:32,543 --> 00:48:35,143
He's coming back to celebrate the millennium, right?

728
00:48:35,712 --> 00:48:36,813
Not as a group.

729
00:48:37,353 --> 00:48:39,752
Seo Tai Ji continues as a soloist.

730
00:48:49,663 --> 00:48:50,793
What's wrong?

731
00:48:52,192 --> 00:48:53,333
Are you disappointed?

732
00:48:54,433 --> 00:48:55,533
That's...

733
00:48:56,703 --> 00:48:58,072
just like Seo Tai Ji.

734
00:48:59,402 --> 00:49:01,502
You need new music for the new millennium.

735
00:49:04,442 --> 00:49:08,212
I kept my word. Can we go eat now?

736
00:49:08,212 --> 00:49:10,382
- Sure.
- Okay. Let's go.

737
00:49:11,513 --> 00:49:14,322
- Seriously...
- Go.

738
00:49:14,322 --> 00:49:16,382
- Hurry up.
- Nice.

739
00:49:22,063 --> 00:49:24,563
This is the last time, okay?

740
00:49:24,563 --> 00:49:26,993
One more time.

741
00:49:31,632 --> 00:49:32,873
Order.

742
00:49:34,302 --> 00:49:35,942
Okay.

743
00:49:43,313 --> 00:49:45,513
You're here, Jin Do Jun.

744
00:49:46,853 --> 00:49:48,123
Gosh.

745
00:49:48,922 --> 00:49:51,853
It's really nice to see you in Prestigious Club.

746
00:49:54,393 --> 00:49:55,793
It's so nice to see you.

747
00:49:55,793 --> 00:49:57,362
We made a bet.

748
00:49:57,362 --> 00:49:59,232
Seong Jun said...

749
00:49:59,232 --> 00:50:01,033
you were a boring bookworm,

750
00:50:01,033 --> 00:50:03,502
so you would never join our club.

751
00:50:04,072 --> 00:50:05,203
Prestigious Club?

752
00:50:05,203 --> 00:50:07,103
She's Seo Min Yeong, also a freshman...

753
00:50:07,103 --> 00:50:09,473
of the Department of Law.

754
00:50:09,473 --> 00:50:10,543
Hold on.

755
00:50:17,453 --> 00:50:19,212
You're obedient.

756
00:50:19,212 --> 00:50:20,953
You only did this.

757
00:50:26,353 --> 00:50:27,623
She's a guest difficult to invite.

758
00:50:27,623 --> 00:50:29,522
Seo Min Yeong from Hanil Girls' High School.

759
00:50:29,522 --> 00:50:32,493
Her father is working in Seoul District Public Prosecutors' Office.

760
00:50:32,493 --> 00:50:34,632
In the end, you're here.

761
00:50:35,203 --> 00:50:36,402
As Do Jun's partner.

762
00:50:37,902 --> 00:50:40,373
Anyway, welcome.

763
00:50:58,552 --> 00:51:01,163
This is Ha In Seok. Jin Do Jun,

764
00:51:01,163 --> 00:51:02,822
I mean, this is the route of 4-2.

765
00:51:11,203 --> 00:51:13,873
You should have told me the truth from the beginning.

766
00:51:13,873 --> 00:51:15,723
If I had known, I wouldn't have come.

767
00:51:16,672 --> 00:51:18,143
Why did you bring me here?

768
00:51:19,243 --> 00:51:21,683
- Because you're qualified.
- What?

769
00:51:21,683 --> 00:51:23,513
Seo Min Yeong, the only child of Seo Yoon Ho,

770
00:51:23,513 --> 00:51:25,183
the deputy prosecutor...

771
00:51:25,183 --> 00:51:28,083
of Seoul District Public Prosecutors' Office Special Unit.

772
00:51:28,783 --> 00:51:30,353
It's a social gathering that suits you.

773
00:51:30,353 --> 00:51:31,522
This Prestigious Club.

774
00:51:35,163 --> 00:51:36,363
It's a social gathering?

775
00:51:38,462 --> 00:51:41,533
Friendship where you back each other up when you're in trouble...

776
00:51:41,533 --> 00:51:44,533
once you each hold a position after graduating?

777
00:51:45,672 --> 00:51:49,203
Close-knit friendship...

778
00:51:49,203 --> 00:51:52,442
that ignores law and policies as if they're nothing?

779
00:51:53,513 --> 00:51:55,212
A social gathering, you said?

780
00:51:55,212 --> 00:51:57,162
Not a gathering of potential criminals?

781
00:51:59,612 --> 00:52:01,422
Don't be mistaken, Jin Do Jun.

782
00:52:01,422 --> 00:52:04,652
What you can share here isn't deep friendship.

783
00:52:05,493 --> 00:52:07,822
It's a strong privilege.

784
00:52:07,822 --> 00:52:09,223
It doesn't suit me.

785
00:52:09,862 --> 00:52:12,793
I never had such a privilege...

786
00:52:12,793 --> 00:52:14,563
nor did I expect one.

787
00:52:18,802 --> 00:52:21,052
You're the one who's mistaken, Seo Min Yeong.

788
00:52:22,772 --> 00:52:26,473
So you think you're free from those privileges?

789
00:52:28,243 --> 00:52:31,382
Because you entered the best university in Korea...

790
00:52:31,382 --> 00:52:34,882
with the exam scores you worked hard to achieve with your smart brain.

791
00:52:38,893 --> 00:52:41,592
The fact that you were able to focus solely on studying...

792
00:52:41,592 --> 00:52:43,723
throughout the three years of high school.

793
00:52:44,793 --> 00:52:46,462
And the fact that you can only focus...

794
00:52:46,462 --> 00:52:49,362
on studying instead of worrying about making a living now.

795
00:52:49,933 --> 00:52:51,302
Haven't you thought...

796
00:52:51,302 --> 00:52:54,452
that it's thanks to your parents' financial and mental support?

797
00:52:57,002 --> 00:52:59,712
The family of bench and bar for generations.

798
00:52:59,712 --> 00:53:01,382
A healthy body and a smart brain.

799
00:53:02,283 --> 00:53:03,533
Have you never thought...

800
00:53:05,853 --> 00:53:08,922
that all of those were privileges given to you for free...

801
00:53:11,123 --> 00:53:12,652
ever since you were born?

802
00:53:28,942 --> 00:53:30,942
About Do Jun, sir.

803
00:53:32,013 --> 00:53:33,712
He's adjusting well to his university life...

804
00:53:33,712 --> 00:53:35,382
just like his peers.

805
00:53:39,552 --> 00:53:42,283
- Is that so?
- Now's the best time in life.

806
00:53:42,283 --> 00:53:44,022
Even though he has 24 billion won,

807
00:53:44,022 --> 00:53:45,522
he's still young.

808
00:53:48,563 --> 00:53:51,033
I wonder what he's thinking.

809
00:53:52,163 --> 00:53:53,232
Oh, well.

810
00:53:54,362 --> 00:53:57,132
You don't even know what your own son is thinking.

811
00:53:59,002 --> 00:54:00,302
He is...

812
00:54:02,172 --> 00:54:04,442
too distant of a family for me to know about him.

813
00:54:04,442 --> 00:54:08,783
Hando Steel reported bankruptcy as they could not manage the debt...

814
00:54:08,783 --> 00:54:11,052
from debt financing.

815
00:54:11,052 --> 00:54:14,422
Hando Steel has a debt over four trillion won in total.

816
00:54:14,422 --> 00:54:18,822
Big social and economical impacts are expected.

817
00:54:18,822 --> 00:54:20,493
The company that placed 1th in wealth ranking.

818
00:54:20,493 --> 00:54:24,333
The company with the biggest debt of 4.2 trillion won...

819
00:54:24,333 --> 00:54:26,163
collapsed in vain.

820
00:54:26,692 --> 00:54:28,763
Vice-Chairman Jin will attend the meeting...

821
00:54:28,763 --> 00:54:30,833
with the creditors himself.

822
00:54:34,603 --> 00:54:35,803
(Vice-Chairman's Office)

823
00:54:40,143 --> 00:54:41,683
We have a problem, sir.

824
00:54:42,212 --> 00:54:44,212
With the acquisition fund of 300 billion won we prepared,

825
00:54:44,212 --> 00:54:46,583
we might not be able to negotiate.

826
00:54:46,583 --> 00:54:48,283
What are you saying now?

827
00:54:48,283 --> 00:54:51,652
There's a company that offered 500 billion won...

828
00:54:51,652 --> 00:54:54,393
that the creditors demanded as the acquisition fund.

829
00:54:54,393 --> 00:54:55,922
Is it Daeyoung?

830
00:54:55,922 --> 00:54:56,962
Actually...

831
00:54:57,862 --> 00:54:59,562
It's a foreign investment company.

832
00:55:02,533 --> 00:55:04,873
Is there a special reason why a foreign company...

833
00:55:04,873 --> 00:55:05,933
took over a big Korean company?

834
00:55:05,933 --> 00:55:07,672
Are you going to take over Hando Steel?

835
00:55:07,672 --> 00:55:09,643
Did you really offer 500 billion won?

836
00:55:09,643 --> 00:55:11,942
- Are you going to take over?
- Please tell us!

837
00:55:11,942 --> 00:55:13,212
- Why did you do it?
- Did you take over the company...

838
00:55:13,212 --> 00:55:14,442
at 500 billion won?

839
00:55:14,442 --> 00:55:15,442
Of course.

840
00:55:16,013 --> 00:55:17,652
Power Shares is an investment company...

841
00:55:17,652 --> 00:55:19,302
that focuses on the future value.

842
00:55:19,882 --> 00:55:23,382
The 500 billion won we offered is the future value of Hando Steel.

843
00:55:25,192 --> 00:55:27,592
An American investment company, Power Shares.

844
00:55:27,592 --> 00:55:29,962
Oh Se Hyeon, the representative of East Asia region.

845
00:55:29,962 --> 00:55:31,293
(Detailed Profile)

846
00:55:31,293 --> 00:55:32,793
He's an investment manager...

847
00:55:32,793 --> 00:55:34,462
who invests in companies' future values.

848
00:55:34,462 --> 00:55:37,362
He's a Korean-American who performs exceptionally well...

849
00:55:37,362 --> 00:55:39,502
when it comes to company takeovers.

850
00:55:39,502 --> 00:55:40,572
Future values?

851
00:55:41,272 --> 00:55:43,643
Why would a foreign investment company...

852
00:55:43,643 --> 00:55:45,443
that performed exceptionally well...

853
00:55:46,043 --> 00:55:47,112
want to take over...

854
00:55:47,643 --> 00:55:51,583
a weak and small company like Hando Steel?

855
00:55:52,413 --> 00:55:53,853
Just why?

856
00:56:00,922 --> 00:56:04,462
It's a chess piece.

857
00:56:06,763 --> 00:56:09,703
There must be the chess board's owner.

858
00:56:11,132 --> 00:56:12,933
The owner?

859
00:56:15,143 --> 00:56:16,643
Whoever...

860
00:56:17,813 --> 00:56:21,683
can't stand to watch Soonyang take over Hando Steel.

861
00:56:25,513 --> 00:56:26,783
That person is...

862
00:56:30,052 --> 00:56:31,752
the owner of the chess board.

863
00:56:40,862 --> 00:56:43,203
(Three Way Restaurant)

864
00:56:47,502 --> 00:56:50,172
(Three Way Restaurant)

865
00:56:50,172 --> 00:56:52,342
- Gosh!
- My goodness.

866
00:56:52,342 --> 00:56:55,913
Gosh, Gyeong Hui. You said your back isn't well.

867
00:56:55,913 --> 00:56:58,013
Oh, dear.

868
00:56:58,013 --> 00:57:00,752
- You'll hurt your back.
- It's okay.

869
00:57:00,752 --> 00:57:03,422
- Goodness.
- I can't believe this.

870
00:57:03,422 --> 00:57:05,592
Gosh.

871
00:57:05,592 --> 00:57:07,692
- Be careful.
- Okay.

872
00:57:07,692 --> 00:57:09,123
Goodness!

873
00:57:09,663 --> 00:57:11,933
You'll hurt yourself.

874
00:57:25,342 --> 00:57:27,212
Did you say he was Oh Se Hyeon?

875
00:57:27,212 --> 00:57:28,212
Yes.

876
00:57:29,543 --> 00:57:30,612
Dig into him.

877
00:57:32,752 --> 00:57:34,112
What he's thinking...

878
00:57:36,022 --> 00:57:37,223
and who he's meeting.

879
00:57:38,223 --> 00:57:39,223
Yes, sir.

880
00:58:05,482 --> 00:58:08,082
I shouldn't have gotten involved in the first place.

881
00:58:09,583 --> 00:58:12,822
Because of you, I am breaking my first rule...

882
00:58:12,822 --> 00:58:15,163
of investment for the first time.

883
00:58:17,833 --> 00:58:21,132
The corporate value of Hando Steel is 500 billion won?

884
00:58:21,132 --> 00:58:22,132
No.

885
00:58:22,902 --> 00:58:25,602
Nevertheless, the investor wants to invest in it? Yes.

886
00:58:26,402 --> 00:58:27,402
Yes.

887
00:58:29,342 --> 00:58:30,792
Tell me the reason, at least.

888
00:58:31,813 --> 00:58:33,613
Why are you investing so recklessly?

889
00:58:35,313 --> 00:58:38,813
Keep investors' secrets no matter what happens.

890
00:58:40,783 --> 00:58:42,533
That's your investment rule, right?

891
00:58:47,623 --> 00:58:49,073
I have to stop Hando Steel...

892
00:58:49,862 --> 00:58:52,462
from falling into Vice-Chairman Jin's hands.

893
00:58:53,663 --> 00:58:54,663
Vice-Chairman Jin?

894
00:58:56,663 --> 00:58:59,632
He's your uncle. The successor of Soonyang.

895
00:59:00,703 --> 00:59:02,903
You should be nice to your family, so why...

896
00:59:05,672 --> 00:59:07,783
What you want...

897
00:59:09,513 --> 00:59:10,913
isn't just Hando Steel?

898
00:59:13,152 --> 00:59:14,683
In the end, what you want...

899
00:59:15,822 --> 00:59:16,853
is Soonyang?

900
00:59:20,853 --> 00:59:23,223
You want to become the owner of Soonyang?

901
00:59:34,743 --> 00:59:37,002
(Soonyang Group)

902
00:59:56,962 --> 01:00:00,962
(Reborn Rich)

903
01:00:31,632 --> 01:00:32,763
Are you asking because you don't know,

904
01:00:32,763 --> 01:00:34,293
or do you want to pretend that you don't know?

905
01:00:34,293 --> 01:00:35,362
It's my present.

906
01:00:35,362 --> 01:00:36,862
Do Jun.

907
01:00:36,862 --> 01:00:39,072
I prepared it to welcome you.

908
01:00:39,072 --> 01:00:40,073
Darn it.

909
01:00:40,073 --> 01:00:43,302
Don't give me another presumptuous advice.

910
01:00:43,302 --> 01:00:45,013
You're going to take over Hando Steel?

911
01:00:45,013 --> 01:00:47,413
You want to beat Daeyoung so bad.

912
01:00:47,413 --> 01:00:50,013
If you ever let Daeyoung take Hando Steel...

913
01:00:50,543 --> 01:00:54,652
The person who gave Daeyoung the money is someone from Soonyang.

914
01:00:54,652 --> 01:00:58,393
The eldest son succeeding. This isn't Joseon Dynasty.

915
01:00:58,393 --> 01:01:01,293
I'll show Father who I am.

916
01:01:01,922 --> 01:01:04,592
It's not over until it's over.

917
01:01:05,192 --> 01:01:07,592
I never forgave those...

918
01:01:08,462 --> 01:01:09,962
who went against me.

919
