(Episode 7)

13
00:01:17,844 --> 00:01:19,745
You know Miracle Investment, right?

14
00:01:20,615 --> 00:01:23,514
They're the majority shareholder
of Jaea Construction...

15
00:01:24,044 --> 00:01:26,544
that messed with you so nicely
and took over...

16
00:01:26,984 --> 00:01:28,954
New Seoul Town's management rights.

17
00:01:30,725 --> 00:01:31,925
Then...

18
00:01:32,354 --> 00:01:36,225
do you also know who
the company's real owner is?

19
00:01:37,794 --> 00:01:39,365
You're talking like you know who it is.

20
00:01:41,495 --> 00:01:42,564
Who is it?

21
00:02:22,105 --> 00:02:23,474
I'm Miracle's majority shareholder,

22
00:02:25,105 --> 00:02:26,344
Jin Do Jun.

23
00:02:27,745 --> 00:02:28,814
You...

24
00:02:30,015 --> 00:02:31,384
What?

25
00:02:33,814 --> 00:02:34,855
You're...

26
00:02:38,585 --> 00:02:41,124
The majority shareholder hiding
behind Oh Se Hyeon...

27
00:02:42,055 --> 00:02:43,355
is you, Do Jun?

28
00:02:46,624 --> 00:02:47,865
Is that it?

29
00:02:52,004 --> 00:02:54,805
Using Chang Je to humiliate me...

30
00:02:56,175 --> 00:02:58,404
and taking the New Seoul Town project...

31
00:03:01,914 --> 00:03:04,344
That was you, Do Jun?

32
00:03:09,115 --> 00:03:11,375
You used my reluctance
to give up on cars...

33
00:03:11,455 --> 00:03:15,025
and used Ahjin Motors as bait
to take Soonyang Motors' shares.

34
00:03:17,224 --> 00:03:19,745
You forced me to buy Hando Steel...

35
00:03:19,825 --> 00:03:21,995
at an exorbitant price to drain our funds.

36
00:03:22,934 --> 00:03:24,884
You did all that
with Oh Se Hyeon as a pawn...

37
00:03:24,964 --> 00:03:27,105
to toy with me to do this
and that?

38
00:03:29,605 --> 00:03:32,004
The punk who dared to challenge me...

39
00:03:36,214 --> 00:03:38,045
was Jin Yang Cheol's youngest grandson.

40
00:03:41,754 --> 00:03:43,154
Jin Do Jun.

41
00:03:48,094 --> 00:03:49,395
Was it really you?

42
00:03:53,224 --> 00:03:54,335
Yes, Grandfather.

43
00:03:59,964 --> 00:04:01,105
They were all...

44
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:04,924
decisions I made
as Miracle's majority shareholder.

45
00:04:05,004 --> 00:04:06,145
Why?

46
00:04:06,745 --> 00:04:09,414
Why did you do such a thing? Why?

47
00:04:12,914 --> 00:04:14,254
Did you think...

48
00:04:15,515 --> 00:04:17,154
this would make me...

49
00:04:17,355 --> 00:04:19,925
leave Soonyang to you when
you're not my eldest grandson?

50
00:04:25,495 --> 00:04:26,725
No, Grandfather.

51
00:04:34,074 --> 00:04:35,374
I'd like to buy...

52
00:04:36,405 --> 00:04:37,444
Soonyang.

53
00:04:42,045 --> 00:04:43,074
What?

54
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:48,584
I will buy Soonyang.

55
00:04:52,285 --> 00:04:53,285
With my money.

56
00:04:56,124 --> 00:05:01,095
(Reborn Rich)

57
00:05:03,735 --> 00:05:04,865
Who is...

58
00:05:05,905 --> 00:05:07,305
Miracle's true owner?

59
00:05:09,204 --> 00:05:11,574
You really don't know?

60
00:05:12,675 --> 00:05:15,675
You got knocked out the moment
you stepped into the ring.

61
00:05:16,175 --> 00:05:19,485
I thought you'd know
all about your opponent by now.

62
00:05:20,444 --> 00:05:25,225
Isn't that the only way you can try
to get your own back?

63
00:05:28,055 --> 00:05:32,725
You're a nicer person than I thought,
Seong Jun.

64
00:05:36,295 --> 00:05:37,564
You don't suit me.

65
00:05:41,105 --> 00:05:44,574
You asked me to see you as a person,
not as a title.

66
00:05:46,805 --> 00:05:48,014
That's my answer.

67
00:05:48,814 --> 00:05:52,615
I want to date a man who suits
the position without being...

68
00:05:53,285 --> 00:05:56,814
Chairman Jin Yang Cheol's eldest grandson.

69
00:05:58,725 --> 00:05:59,754
Did you...

70
00:06:00,925 --> 00:06:02,394
just reject me?

71
00:06:06,524 --> 00:06:08,465
Let's end it on a high note.

72
00:06:09,495 --> 00:06:12,134
So we can smile if we meet again.

73
00:06:18,074 --> 00:06:20,745
You reject me and then say
you'll see me again?

74
00:06:21,374 --> 00:06:23,845
You're interesting to the very end.

75
00:06:28,855 --> 00:06:29,855
What?

76
00:06:32,285 --> 00:06:33,655
You'll buy Soonyang?

77
00:06:35,124 --> 00:06:36,194
With your money?

78
00:06:50,944 --> 00:06:54,395
Did getting your hands on
over ten million dollars...

79
00:06:54,475 --> 00:06:57,415
at a young age make you think
money is nothing?

80
00:06:58,814 --> 00:07:00,934
To you, is Soonyang
a large piece of candy...

81
00:07:01,014 --> 00:07:03,314
you can get at a corner store?

82
00:07:04,985 --> 00:07:06,324
It's not because money is nothing,

83
00:07:07,725 --> 00:07:09,595
nor because I think lightly of Soonyang.

84
00:07:11,894 --> 00:07:14,965
You started as a delivery boy
at a rice mill in Incheon...

85
00:07:16,264 --> 00:07:18,504
and built up Soonyang Group
that pays 200,000 employees.

86
00:07:19,865 --> 00:07:22,774
I know better than anyone
how much sweat and tears...

87
00:07:24,374 --> 00:07:25,944
you shed on the way.

88
00:07:28,245 --> 00:07:29,314
One day,

89
00:07:31,014 --> 00:07:33,285
my eldest uncle will become chairman.

90
00:07:35,184 --> 00:07:38,425
The eldest inherits all,
and that's our family's... No.

91
00:07:40,454 --> 00:07:41,925
That's your rule.

92
00:07:42,725 --> 00:07:45,425
You know that so well, so why?

93
00:07:50,465 --> 00:07:51,735
But Grandfather.

94
00:07:54,134 --> 00:07:55,475
Will Soonyang then...

95
00:07:57,004 --> 00:07:58,745
be the same Soonyang it is now?

96
00:08:01,345 --> 00:08:03,074
Just because he inherited
your family name...

97
00:08:04,415 --> 00:08:06,745
doesn't mean he inherited
your entrepreneurship.

98
00:08:13,555 --> 00:08:15,595
You're concerned more than anyone.

99
00:08:16,855 --> 00:08:18,394
Unlike any other founder
of a large company,

100
00:08:18,995 --> 00:08:22,564
you haven't given Uncle anything.
Isn't that the reason?

101
00:08:48,154 --> 00:08:49,524
Do you remember what I said?

102
00:08:50,654 --> 00:08:52,214
Anyone who goes against me,

103
00:08:52,294 --> 00:08:54,664
I never forgive,
whether he be a sibling or a son.

104
00:08:57,164 --> 00:08:58,735
Do you think a grandson is any different?

105
00:09:02,004 --> 00:09:03,835
Go back to studying law.

106
00:09:04,174 --> 00:09:07,815
So it doesn't get in your way,
as of today, I will confiscate your pawn.

107
00:09:09,274 --> 00:09:10,985
If Oh Se Hyeon doesn't egg you on,

108
00:09:12,845 --> 00:09:14,855
you'll grow out of this phase soon enough.

109
00:09:17,955 --> 00:09:20,185
Drop the charges
and have him released, Grandfather.

110
00:09:26,264 --> 00:09:27,915
I'll sign over the business rights...

111
00:09:27,995 --> 00:09:29,465
to New Seoul Town's
320,000m² housing complex...

112
00:09:30,935 --> 00:09:32,705
to Soonyang Construction.

113
00:09:35,304 --> 00:09:37,335
Do you think that's a valid deal?

114
00:09:39,075 --> 00:09:41,475
You study law
at the best university in Korea,

115
00:09:43,274 --> 00:09:44,815
and you know so little about it.

116
00:09:47,384 --> 00:09:50,455
He was arrested
for bribing the Mayor of Seoul.

117
00:09:52,254 --> 00:09:54,554
Chang Je will be replaced
for taking the bribe,

118
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:56,995
and Oh Se Hyeon
will be locked up for giving it.

119
00:09:57,294 --> 00:10:00,695
Then New Seoul Town
as a whole will become Soonyang's.

120
00:10:01,095 --> 00:10:04,235
If you ask me to release
Oh Se Hyeon for just 320,000m²,

121
00:10:05,705 --> 00:10:07,065
would I accept the deal?

122
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:09,674
I haven't even...

123
00:10:11,575 --> 00:10:14,044
started bargaining, Grandfather.

124
00:10:15,345 --> 00:10:18,535
Seoul Mayor Choi Chang Je's
emergency press conference...

125
00:10:18,615 --> 00:10:20,245
will begin shortly.

126
00:10:20,544 --> 00:10:22,585
Please wait a little longer.

127
00:10:22,754 --> 00:10:24,485
What's the agenda
for this press conference?

128
00:10:24,985 --> 00:10:27,814
Is it urgent enough to hold
an unscheduled press conference?

129
00:10:27,894 --> 00:10:30,654
- Is it about the mayor?
- Please tell us in advance.

130
00:10:30,995 --> 00:10:32,385
- I have a question.
- What's it about?

131
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:36,134
The mayor will come down
and announce it himself.

132
00:10:40,065 --> 00:10:41,205
Well...

133
00:10:42,174 --> 00:10:44,605
The agenda
of the emergency press conference.

134
00:10:45,245 --> 00:10:46,945
You want to know, right, Mr. Lee?

135
00:10:52,945 --> 00:10:55,315
The result of the prosecution's
internal investigation came out.

136
00:10:55,554 --> 00:10:58,624
But there was a real estate
speculation force using...

137
00:10:58,985 --> 00:11:01,115
undisclosed internal data...

138
00:11:01,195 --> 00:11:02,995
in the New Seoul Town District.

139
00:11:04,565 --> 00:11:06,225
(Seoul Metropolitan City)

140
00:11:11,764 --> 00:11:14,155
(Land Register, Soosaek District,
Eunpyeong-Gu Office, Seoul)

141
00:11:14,235 --> 00:11:15,235
(Land Register)

142
00:11:17,674 --> 00:11:19,424
You see, the family members...

143
00:11:19,504 --> 00:11:22,235
of Vice-Chairman Jin Young Ki's wife...

144
00:11:22,315 --> 00:11:24,115
appeared on that list.

145
00:11:31,185 --> 00:11:33,284
The mayor is involved
in a corruption scandal.

146
00:11:33,554 --> 00:11:35,624
What was that? Oh, the press conference.

147
00:11:36,394 --> 00:11:38,394
Let him hold one numerous times.

148
00:11:43,095 --> 00:11:45,705
Do you think Chang Je has any power?

149
00:11:48,105 --> 00:11:51,105
If Miracle's majority shareholder
giving money to Mayor Choi...

150
00:11:52,075 --> 00:11:54,075
turns out to be
Chairman Jin's youngest grandson,

151
00:11:56,475 --> 00:11:57,745
it's a different story.

152
00:12:00,615 --> 00:12:03,554
The daughter-in-law was immersed
in land speculation,

153
00:12:03,715 --> 00:12:06,054
using private internal information.

154
00:12:06,725 --> 00:12:10,124
The youngest grandson committed
a shameless act of bribing...

155
00:12:10,455 --> 00:12:12,785
the son-in-law,
the mayor of Seoul, to win...

156
00:12:12,865 --> 00:12:14,365
a development project on that land.

157
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:18,625
People will believe the mastermind
was Soonyang Group's chairman,

158
00:12:18,705 --> 00:12:20,134
Jin Yang Cheol.

159
00:12:38,685 --> 00:12:39,985
To the government that needs...

160
00:12:40,654 --> 00:12:43,355
to revitalize real estate policies
as an economic stimulus,

161
00:12:44,894 --> 00:12:46,825
Soonyang will become the guinea pig
they'll punish.

162
00:12:48,595 --> 00:12:50,264
You might never get another chance...

163
00:12:50,935 --> 00:12:53,134
in Gangnam reconstruction projects...

164
00:12:54,065 --> 00:12:56,004
or various government led
construction projects.

165
00:13:00,345 --> 00:13:01,475
Are you still...

166
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:05,485
going to indict CEO Oh for offering bribes?

167
00:13:19,325 --> 00:13:22,054
To deal with real estate speculators...

168
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:25,205
using undisclosed data,
the Seoul Metropolitan Government...

169
00:13:25,465 --> 00:13:28,824
excluded Soosaek District
and only chose Sangam District...

170
00:13:28,904 --> 00:13:31,824
as New Seoul Town's development
district target.

171
00:13:31,904 --> 00:13:34,094
Are you not revealing
the list of real estate speculators?

172
00:13:34,174 --> 00:13:36,964
Is it true a high ranking society member
was involved in it?

173
00:13:37,044 --> 00:13:39,334
- Please answer the question.
- We want a statement.

174
00:13:39,414 --> 00:13:42,355
I, Seoul Mayor Choi Chang Je,
will promise you.

175
00:13:43,514 --> 00:13:45,985
I will fulfill my responsibility...

176
00:13:46,825 --> 00:13:49,654
so that the homeless common people...

177
00:13:50,624 --> 00:13:54,024
no longer shed tears
because of real estate speculators.

178
00:13:57,465 --> 00:13:59,565
Both investigations
on Mayor Choi's bribery scandal...

179
00:13:59,835 --> 00:14:01,294
and the real estate speculation...

180
00:14:01,374 --> 00:14:02,935
of Vice-Chairman's wife's family...

181
00:14:06,205 --> 00:14:08,075
were closed without charges.

182
00:14:17,514 --> 00:14:18,524
Tell me who.

183
00:14:21,195 --> 00:14:22,225
You see...

184
00:14:23,455 --> 00:14:24,865
My parents...

185
00:14:27,095 --> 00:14:28,485
My family...

186
00:14:28,565 --> 00:14:29,735
Are you even...

187
00:14:31,835 --> 00:14:33,365
lying to me?

188
00:14:34,304 --> 00:14:35,304
Father.

189
00:14:38,345 --> 00:14:39,504
Your family?

190
00:14:40,374 --> 00:14:41,475
You know what?

191
00:14:43,075 --> 00:14:45,334
Who do you think can make...

192
00:14:45,414 --> 00:14:47,434
300 million dollars in cash
with just a phone call...

193
00:14:47,514 --> 00:14:49,455
in Korea right now?

194
00:14:51,254 --> 00:14:52,175
Excuse me?

195
00:14:52,255 --> 00:14:54,695
Not me nor Daeyoung Group's Ju Yeong Il.

196
00:14:56,225 --> 00:14:59,195
The financer of Myeong-dong
private loan market, Son Ho Chun.

197
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:01,294
Your father.

198
00:15:02,065 --> 00:15:03,095
My in-law.

199
00:15:04,735 --> 00:15:06,504
The world is a nasty place, no?

200
00:15:06,764 --> 00:15:09,094
Those who need urgent money...

201
00:15:09,174 --> 00:15:11,724
suck up to your father.
But behind his back,

202
00:15:11,804 --> 00:15:14,144
they point fingers at him
for being a loan shark.

203
00:15:14,544 --> 00:15:15,544
Even so,

204
00:15:16,475 --> 00:15:18,165
there's one thing your father never does.

205
00:15:18,245 --> 00:15:19,315
Do you know what that is?

206
00:15:21,185 --> 00:15:23,275
The only way he makes money
is by lending money.

207
00:15:23,355 --> 00:15:26,024
He never look elsewhere. Why?

208
00:15:28,495 --> 00:15:31,565
Because that's the financer Son Ho Chun's
honour and pride.

209
00:15:33,995 --> 00:15:35,385
You're his daughter.

210
00:15:35,465 --> 00:15:37,865
How come you know so little about him?

211
00:15:43,674 --> 00:15:44,705
Who was it?

212
00:15:45,374 --> 00:15:46,964
Who was it that egged you on...

213
00:15:47,044 --> 00:15:50,674
to use your family names
to speculate these lands? Tell me.

214
00:15:52,414 --> 00:15:53,745
Tell me who it was!

215
00:15:58,424 --> 00:16:00,725
(Sangam and Soosaek
District Development Plan)

216
00:16:11,904 --> 00:16:13,835
Grandfather is
in the second floor study, right?

217
00:16:14,065 --> 00:16:15,155
Why do you ask?

218
00:16:15,235 --> 00:16:16,525
I have something to tell him.

219
00:16:16,605 --> 00:16:17,774
Gosh, not now.

220
00:16:18,575 --> 00:16:20,644
I don't know what it's about,
but do it later.

221
00:16:21,674 --> 00:16:23,765
After telling your mother off,

222
00:16:23,845 --> 00:16:25,514
he summoned your father.

223
00:16:26,185 --> 00:16:28,585
If you get dragged in for no reason,

224
00:16:29,485 --> 00:16:31,884
I will be too upset to do anything.

225
00:16:37,355 --> 00:16:39,294
It's all my fault, Father.

226
00:16:41,294 --> 00:16:42,935
I had this burning desire...

227
00:16:43,965 --> 00:16:45,565
to make up for the loss caused...

228
00:16:46,965 --> 00:16:49,105
when acquiring Hando Steel
and couldn't stop myself.

229
00:16:51,445 --> 00:16:53,304
Was that the only solution
you could think of?

230
00:16:56,475 --> 00:16:58,384
Don't you know
what the world is like today?

231
00:17:00,215 --> 00:17:01,715
What are you? A pheasant's baby?

232
00:17:02,554 --> 00:17:05,254
Did you think nobody would know if
you kept your head down?

233
00:17:14,635 --> 00:17:15,695
Enough. Get up now.

234
00:17:16,864 --> 00:17:20,264
A man shouldn't go down
on his knees so quickly.

235
00:17:23,274 --> 00:17:24,274
Here.

236
00:17:32,245 --> 00:17:33,784
It might rain, Father.

237
00:17:34,854 --> 00:17:35,854
You know, right?

238
00:17:36,854 --> 00:17:39,254
That my knees are more accurate
than the weather center.

239
00:17:41,324 --> 00:17:43,254
You should bundle up...

240
00:17:43,695 --> 00:17:45,524
when you leave for work tomorrow.

241
00:17:46,395 --> 00:17:50,165
It will be tough on you for a while
if your asthma relapses.

242
00:17:53,165 --> 00:17:54,155
I'm here, Uncle.

243
00:17:54,235 --> 00:17:57,175
Gosh, my youngest nephew.

244
00:17:57,274 --> 00:18:00,645
I'm glad I listened to you
and came up with a plan.

245
00:18:01,044 --> 00:18:04,715
But how did you think of it
at such a young age?

246
00:18:06,245 --> 00:18:09,514
Well, not everyone can become
a majority shareholder of Miracle.

247
00:18:09,614 --> 00:18:12,524
It's just an investment
as a way of studying.

248
00:18:13,455 --> 00:18:16,725
If you're interested in business,
why not join Soonyang?

249
00:18:18,665 --> 00:18:19,864
You know my family situation.

250
00:18:20,395 --> 00:18:23,165
Grandfather excluded me
from the succession order.

251
00:18:23,564 --> 00:18:25,655
Really, he's an impossible man.

252
00:18:25,735 --> 00:18:28,304
Once he loses trust in someone,
he sees the end of them.

253
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:33,565
Geez. He'll try to drag me down...

254
00:18:33,645 --> 00:18:35,095
throughout my term.

255
00:18:35,175 --> 00:18:36,274
(Seoul Metropolitan City)

256
00:18:36,475 --> 00:18:38,145
It worries me.

257
00:18:41,114 --> 00:18:42,114
Then...

258
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:46,084
soar high enough so he can't drag you down.

259
00:18:48,054 --> 00:18:49,725
Me, who doesn't even have
a base in the party?

260
00:18:49,854 --> 00:18:51,125
How high can I go up?

261
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:56,935
To the highest end
with the support of the people.

262
00:19:01,774 --> 00:19:03,435
If 7,000 houses are supplied...

263
00:19:03,935 --> 00:19:05,945
through the New Seoul Town project,

264
00:19:06,705 --> 00:19:08,745
it will be a great help to solve
the real estate problem.

265
00:19:09,114 --> 00:19:12,385
What's more, DMC Construction...

266
00:19:13,014 --> 00:19:15,554
is the symbol
of advanced technology and business.

267
00:19:16,084 --> 00:19:17,405
If the mayor of Seoul...

268
00:19:17,485 --> 00:19:18,905
solves the problem
of people's livelihoods...

269
00:19:18,985 --> 00:19:20,584
and has a vision for the future,

270
00:19:22,925 --> 00:19:24,054
where else should he advance to...

271
00:19:25,695 --> 00:19:27,024
other than the Blue House?

272
00:19:29,834 --> 00:19:30,864
Do Jun.

273
00:19:32,334 --> 00:19:35,205
New Seoul Town and DMC.

274
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:38,405
Presidential candidate Choi Chang Je.

275
00:19:39,475 --> 00:19:41,875
It'll become
your biggest achievement, Uncle.

276
00:19:50,715 --> 00:19:52,955
Mayor Choi Chang Je
is going to become the president?

277
00:19:54,955 --> 00:19:57,254
Do you really think
he'll become a presidential candidate?

278
00:19:59,465 --> 00:20:01,395
It's like I prescribed him a sedative.

279
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,135
Mayor Choi.

280
00:20:04,294 --> 00:20:05,924
This was the first time he won...

281
00:20:06,004 --> 00:20:07,205
against those he feared.

282
00:20:07,705 --> 00:20:09,875
He must feel as anxious
as his sense of achievement.

283
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:12,565
I had to blind him
with a greater ambition...

284
00:20:12,645 --> 00:20:13,705
to get rid of that fear.

285
00:20:14,544 --> 00:20:16,415
We need to use him as our man...

286
00:20:17,814 --> 00:20:19,314
until the completion of DMC.

287
00:20:24,114 --> 00:20:25,125
Here.

288
00:20:26,655 --> 00:20:29,324
Instead of tofu, since you're from the US.

289
00:20:35,034 --> 00:20:36,235
Be honest with me.

290
00:20:37,235 --> 00:20:38,764
You're not 22, right?

291
00:20:41,004 --> 00:20:42,994
If I rip off that good looking mask,

292
00:20:43,074 --> 00:20:45,205
maybe I'll find
a 40-year-old man inside you.

293
00:20:46,304 --> 00:20:49,074
Or is this your second life?

294
00:20:51,014 --> 00:20:52,344
Tell me which one it is.

295
00:20:57,054 --> 00:20:59,625
You said partners
must be honest with each other.

296
00:21:03,395 --> 00:21:04,455
It's both of them.

297
00:21:08,965 --> 00:21:09,995
Stop bluffing.

298
00:21:11,135 --> 00:21:12,334
Forget it. You're in your 20s.

299
00:21:18,675 --> 00:21:20,044
Why did you do it?

300
00:21:22,415 --> 00:21:23,715
The land in Soosaek District...

301
00:21:24,885 --> 00:21:26,645
- was my...
- Your grandfather.

302
00:21:28,655 --> 00:21:31,885
He will forgive me.

303
00:21:35,625 --> 00:21:38,165
But not you.

304
00:21:42,465 --> 00:21:45,004
Be very careful not to do anything...

305
00:21:46,034 --> 00:21:48,905
that'll make you lose
your grandfather's trust.

306
00:21:51,074 --> 00:21:53,344
You know what I mean, don't you?

307
00:21:58,044 --> 00:22:00,014
The only asset I have...

308
00:22:02,155 --> 00:22:03,314
is you.

309
00:22:04,514 --> 00:22:06,125
The house and company...

310
00:22:07,155 --> 00:22:08,725
are your grandfather's.

311
00:22:11,965 --> 00:22:13,064
But I...

312
00:22:14,665 --> 00:22:15,895
only have you.

313
00:22:20,205 --> 00:22:21,574
The eldest grandson of this family.

314
00:22:36,554 --> 00:22:38,014
It's raining, Seong Jun.

315
00:22:42,625 --> 00:22:44,824
The sky is so fickle.

316
00:22:48,834 --> 00:22:50,635
It's so hard to get along with.

317
00:22:55,804 --> 00:22:56,935
My sin...

318
00:23:01,304 --> 00:23:02,375
runs deep.

319
00:23:08,014 --> 00:23:09,415
In this whole world,

320
00:23:14,084 --> 00:23:16,395
the only father who made his son
live a sentence...

321
00:23:21,995 --> 00:23:25,764
and turned him into a cripple was me.

322
00:23:31,745 --> 00:23:32,975
What should be blamed...

323
00:23:34,544 --> 00:23:36,044
is that period.

324
00:23:39,245 --> 00:23:41,805
During the military regime,
someone had to take responsibility...

325
00:23:41,885 --> 00:23:43,575
so long as Soonyang was the target.

326
00:23:43,655 --> 00:23:44,784
You simply...

327
00:23:47,824 --> 00:23:50,094
did your utmost best
to protect the group...

328
00:23:51,925 --> 00:23:54,594
by offering Soonyang Transportation.

329
00:24:02,735 --> 00:24:04,055
I will make sure...

330
00:24:04,135 --> 00:24:06,604
word doesn't travel outside
regarding Do Jun's matter.

331
00:24:08,814 --> 00:24:09,844
Why?

332
00:24:11,844 --> 00:24:15,084
Have I lost face even
in your eyes, Hang Jae?

335
00:24:32,935 --> 00:24:35,604
Your children will never succeed...

00:24:38,475 --> 00:24:40,325
Let me help you, Mother.

338
00:24:40,405 --> 00:24:42,395
I can finish it on my own in no time.

339
00:24:42,475 --> 00:24:44,464
I know what to do. Look.

340
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:46,614
Snap. Like that.

341
00:24:48,145 --> 00:24:50,415
Thanks to your great family love,

342
00:24:53,655 --> 00:24:55,725
I lost my beloved family.

343
00:25:03,564 --> 00:25:04,594
Now,

344
00:25:07,235 --> 00:25:10,705
I have become incapable
of returning to my family.

345
00:25:16,415 --> 00:25:17,774
I will never allow...

346
00:25:18,245 --> 00:25:20,945
your children to share Soonyang...

347
00:25:21,445 --> 00:25:23,155
happily and at peace.

348
00:25:26,284 --> 00:25:27,754
This is the real reason...

349
00:25:29,354 --> 00:25:30,655
I'm trying to buy Soonyang.

If you don't have any plans
in the afternoon,

352
00:25:45,561 --> 00:25:48,660
I'll prepare several checkups
since you've come all the way here.

353
00:25:49,061 --> 00:25:50,061
Why?

354
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:52,971
Did you purchase a new piece
of expensive equipment?

355
00:25:53,971 --> 00:25:55,001
Excuse me?

356
00:25:55,170 --> 00:25:56,391
- Mr. Lee.
- Yes?

357
00:25:56,471 --> 00:25:58,811
Give Director Jung a bonus.

358
00:25:59,211 --> 00:26:01,071
Gosh. You're good at business.

359
00:26:02,011 --> 00:26:03,410
And with a rich old man to boot.

360
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:09,950
In that case, please give me
an envelope full of money.

361
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:14,991
But I'm not here as the head
of the group today.

362
00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:17,021
Not as a patient, either.

363
00:26:20,430 --> 00:26:21,930
I came as a guardian.

364
00:26:30,301 --> 00:26:31,801
He's so weak.

365
00:26:33,011 --> 00:26:36,711
Will he be able to act
as a proper chairman after I die?

366
00:26:37,811 --> 00:26:38,981
I'm worried.

367
00:26:41,551 --> 00:26:42,821
From what you see,

368
00:26:44,481 --> 00:26:47,650
is Vice-Chairman Jin the son
who resembles you the most?

369
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:53,881
I thought you were handing over
your position to the son...

370
00:26:53,961 --> 00:26:55,961
who took after you the most in the end.

371
00:26:56,331 --> 00:26:57,400
Are you going to...

372
00:26:59,031 --> 00:27:00,691
stick to primogeniture until the end?

373
00:27:00,771 --> 00:27:01,831
Who is it?

374
00:27:03,771 --> 00:27:04,971
The one who resembles me.

375
00:27:12,751 --> 00:27:13,950
Is there even one who does?

376
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:16,850
Even if there is one,

377
00:27:17,981 --> 00:27:19,551
my children won't accept it.

378
00:27:22,261 --> 00:27:25,590
They will torture and fight each other...

379
00:27:27,531 --> 00:27:28,761
until their last breath.

380
00:27:30,561 --> 00:27:32,100
Isn't that a fiery pit?

381
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:37,271
The fiery pit is for me
to go to after my death...

382
00:27:40,011 --> 00:27:41,910
and not my living children.

383
00:27:48,821 --> 00:27:51,040
Oh, right. When is the meeting...

384
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,620
with the presidents
of the subsidiary companies?

385
00:27:52,890 --> 00:27:55,690
It's at 3pm.
Do you have something else to do?

386
00:27:55,791 --> 00:27:57,390
Yes, I do.

387
00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:08,571
Father. What brings you here?

388
00:28:10,741 --> 00:28:13,241
Why aren't you keeping your promise?

389
00:28:14,741 --> 00:28:15,741
Sorry?

390
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:21,811
When you married someone I disapproved.

391
00:28:23,021 --> 00:28:24,441
When you jumped into the movie industry...

392
00:28:24,521 --> 00:28:25,920
instead of the family business.

393
00:28:27,521 --> 00:28:29,590
Do you know remember what you told me?

394
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:33,930
"I will live as a person who has nothing
to do with Soonyang."

395
00:28:34,061 --> 00:28:34,982
That was my promise.

396
00:28:35,062 --> 00:28:36,261
Then why?

397
00:28:37,531 --> 00:28:38,561
Why?

398
00:28:41,301 --> 00:28:43,501
Why are you breaking it now?

399
00:28:45,541 --> 00:28:47,110
At least you know how shameless you are.

400
00:28:48,011 --> 00:28:50,741
You're using your son
rather than involving yourself.

401
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,150
What are you talking about, Father?

402
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:56,880
Your son, Do Jin.

403
00:28:58,021 --> 00:29:00,291
He declared he was going to buy Soonyang.

404
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,160
In front of me.

00:29:05,461 --> 00:29:07,090
- Mr. Lee.
- Yes, sir.

What?

412
00:29:28,581 --> 00:29:29,650
Is that not enough?

413
00:29:35,021 --> 00:29:38,561
You barely know your own son, don't you?

414
00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:42,360
I'm scared.

00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:45,600
Scared that I might become
a father like you.

416
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,340
The one who had abandoned me
and left Soonyang...

417
00:29:55,410 --> 00:29:56,680
was you, Yoon Ki.

418
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:04,680
Don't have your son...

419

You know, Do Jun...

421
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:27,471
made Father speechless.

422
00:30:32,850 --> 00:30:34,450
You should read this.

423
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:45,190
You have such poor political sense.

424
00:30:45,491 --> 00:30:47,031
Are you sure you can even be re-elected?

425
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:48,311
What?

426
00:30:48,391 --> 00:30:51,531
He gave Soonyang Public Welfare Foundation
to Yoon Ki's family.

427
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:53,571
Do you know what this means?

428
00:30:54,670 --> 00:30:56,921
That's for the medical center
and HR Development Center.

429
00:30:57,001 --> 00:30:58,170
It's not worth much.

430
00:30:58,670 --> 00:31:01,771
"This is all you can have from Soonyang,
Yoon Ki."

431
00:31:03,481 --> 00:31:04,940
He declared this.

My goodness.

433
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:09,600
Do Do Jun and Yoon Ki know...

434
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,880
about this hidden meaning?

435

to Yoon Ki.

453
00:32:10,041 --> 00:32:11,110
Why did he do that?

454
00:32:11,511 --> 00:32:14,811
Why? Why all of a sudden?

455
00:32:15,751 --> 00:32:18,991
As soon as he secured enough money
for the succession.

456
00:32:19,650 --> 00:32:20,721
This is...

457

No.

458
00:32:27,461 --> 00:32:30,660
It's a sign for him
to start the succession.

You should keep an eye
on Junior Managing Director Jin Seong Jun.

461
00:32:37,870 --> 00:32:38,940
You're right.

is insistent on primogeniture.

00:33:14,610 --> 00:33:16,211
that I need to know well
about my opponent...

Did losing the bidding
of the New Seoul Town project...

471
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,831
make you very upset?

472

I learned a lot.

473

earlier on as planned,

488

the business value can be proved.

Let me ask one thing.

493
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:55,640
Why do you have to buy Soonyang?

494
00:34:57,010 --> 00:34:59,780
You can simply get in Chairman Jin's
good grace and succeed the company.

495
00:35:05,791 --> 00:35:07,390
People are strange.

496
00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:10,441
They cannot stand the Kim family
of North Korea...

497
00:35:10,521 --> 00:35:12,220
succeeding the power.

498
00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:16,231
But why do they think nothing of it
when the grandchild of a chairman...

499
00:35:16,930 --> 00:35:18,561
succeeds the management rights
in South Korea?

500
00:35:19,631 --> 00:35:20,771
In the end,

501
00:35:21,631 --> 00:35:24,041
both did not prove
that they were qualified.

502
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,111
You speak as if it's not your business.

503
00:35:26,711 --> 00:35:28,870
Young expat,
you're a grandchild of a chairman too.

504
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:34,280
We've got a problem.

505
00:35:34,711 --> 00:35:36,100
The cable channels and film studios...

506
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:37,401
that were going to move into DMC called...

507
00:35:37,481 --> 00:35:39,550
to say they will cancel the plan.

508
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:41,540
CTV, HNet, KCN,

509
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:42,981
and all the film studios.

510
00:35:43,061 --> 00:35:44,390
All of them at once?

511
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:45,831
Wait.

512
00:35:46,591 --> 00:35:47,791
What's the reason?

513
00:35:48,061 --> 00:35:50,751
A big advertiser demanded...

514
00:35:50,831 --> 00:35:52,361
that they withdraw.

515
00:35:52,570 --> 00:35:54,691
Or else, they would stop all ads
from their affiliates...

516
00:35:54,771 --> 00:35:56,841
and even production support.

517
00:35:57,771 --> 00:35:58,800
An advertiser?

518
00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:02,091
If they're getting
their affiliates involved,

519
00:36:02,171 --> 00:36:03,841
it means they're a big conglomerate.

520
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:12,341
All cable channels and film studios...

521
00:36:12,421 --> 00:36:14,270
that were planning to move
into DMC decided...

522
00:36:14,350 --> 00:36:16,490
to retract the plan.

523
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:17,981
I heard media related academic
organizations...

524
00:36:18,061 --> 00:36:19,231
were going to move in as well.

525
00:36:19,561 --> 00:36:21,260
They are scholars who only study.

526
00:36:22,231 --> 00:36:23,731
How did you persuade them?

527
00:36:23,961 --> 00:36:26,051
I promised them industry academic
cooperation, research grant,

528
00:36:26,131 --> 00:36:28,731
and overseas training.

529
00:36:29,441 --> 00:36:30,470
Okay.

530
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:33,640
Supporting academics
is a way for a company...

531
00:36:33,941 --> 00:36:35,510
to contribute to society as well.

532
00:36:36,381 --> 00:36:37,881
- I will remember that.
- Good.

533
00:36:39,251 --> 00:36:41,801
Goodness, DMC is going to end...

534
00:36:41,881 --> 00:36:44,421
even before they start the construction.

535
00:36:48,791 --> 00:36:49,861
What should we do?

536
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:52,381
It's your uncle's first business...

537
00:36:52,461 --> 00:36:53,760
after he became the mayor.

538
00:36:55,191 --> 00:36:57,861
I'll meet him.

539
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:00,401
- Will you?
- Yes.

540
00:37:01,131 --> 00:37:04,001
Families help each other
when they're in trouble.

541
00:37:09,010 --> 00:37:10,311
Seong Jun,

542
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:12,581
how are things going with her?

543
00:37:17,081 --> 00:37:19,021
The daughter of Hyunsung Daily's CEO.

544
00:37:19,291 --> 00:37:21,050
Why isn't there any news
about your marriage?

545
00:37:23,521 --> 00:37:25,691
Do you guys not get along?

546
00:37:26,461 --> 00:37:27,731
No, Grandfather.

547
00:37:28,430 --> 00:37:29,561
We're seeing each other well.

548
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:32,131
Is that so?

549
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:34,551
A man who manages his family well...

550
00:37:34,631 --> 00:37:36,441
does business well too.

551
00:37:37,970 --> 00:37:39,611
My eldest grandson is all grown up.

552
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:43,041
Okay.

553
00:37:51,251 --> 00:37:53,820
What do you think, Hang Jae?

554
00:37:53,990 --> 00:37:56,320
It will serve
as a strong warning to Do Jun.

555
00:37:56,490 --> 00:37:57,861
If the DMC project doesn't work out,

556
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,051
Miracle Investment
will suffer a heavy blow...

557
00:38:00,131 --> 00:38:01,350
because they spent
a lot on the initial investment.

558
00:38:01,430 --> 00:38:03,131
I mean Seong Jun.

559
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:05,930
My eldest grandson.

560
00:38:08,430 --> 00:38:10,501
He was better
than the CEOs of the affiliates.

561
00:38:12,171 --> 00:38:13,970
He catches on quickly...

562
00:38:14,370 --> 00:38:16,240
to the hidden meaning of your words.

563
00:38:17,410 --> 00:38:19,251
Thank goodness...

564
00:38:21,481 --> 00:38:22,780
that Young Ki has...

565
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:27,990
a smart son like Seong Jun.

566
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,120
- Really?
- Yes.

567
00:38:31,961 --> 00:38:35,030
Chairman Jin is taking Seong Jun with him?

568
00:38:35,331 --> 00:38:37,600
According to the Secretary's Office,
that is right.

569
00:38:40,331 --> 00:38:42,841
Call Seong Jun's office.

570
00:38:43,001 --> 00:38:44,001
I should eat with him.

571
00:38:44,271 --> 00:38:46,111
Well...

572
00:38:47,271 --> 00:38:49,930
Wouldn't it be better for him
to position himself...

573
00:38:50,010 --> 00:38:54,010
as Chairman Jin's grandson
rather than your son?

574
00:38:55,410 --> 00:38:57,841
"Chairman Jin started teaching
his favourite grandson..."

575
00:38:57,921 --> 00:39:00,611
"for him to succeed his place."
This kind of an image.

576
00:39:00,691 --> 00:39:04,490
So I can't even call my son as it is?

577
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:08,191
I'm sorry. I acted out of line.

578
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:19,671
Human Resource Department.

579
00:39:20,910 --> 00:39:22,470
Kim Ju Ryeon of Secretary's Office.

580
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:25,410
Change his post right now.

581
00:39:28,151 --> 00:39:31,521
A deputy manager-level secretary
dedicated to Vice-Chairman.

582
00:39:36,990 --> 00:39:38,061
Thank you, sir!

583
00:39:38,861 --> 00:39:40,131
I'll pledge my allegiance to you.

584
00:39:41,331 --> 00:39:42,861
Is this really Korea?

585
00:39:43,430 --> 00:39:45,001
Not the Republic of Soonyang?

586
00:39:45,361 --> 00:39:46,921
How can they give up on moving into DMC...

587
00:39:47,001 --> 00:39:48,720
with just one word from Soonyang?

588
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:52,541
Cable channels , film studios,
and even academic organizations.

589
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:54,970
It's not one word. It's money.

590
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:57,761
There are only 830,000 paid subscribers...

591
00:39:57,841 --> 00:39:59,180
of cable channels.

592
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:01,301
The advertising industry died out
because of the IMF crisis.

593
00:40:01,381 --> 00:40:04,381
An advertiser like Soonyang
is like their king.

594
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:06,820
You need to listen
to your king to be saved, no?

595
00:40:07,921 --> 00:40:09,740
Not to mention film studios
which Soonyang can interfere...

596
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:11,561
with investment and distribution.

597
00:40:11,861 --> 00:40:14,611
Soonyang's money is spread
all around Korea...

598
00:40:14,691 --> 00:40:16,861
like blood vessels.

599
00:40:17,561 --> 00:40:21,300
That's how Soonyang can move Korea.

600
00:40:21,570 --> 00:40:23,390
Why is high and mighty
Soonyang interfering...

601
00:40:23,470 --> 00:40:25,570
with a trivial matter like moving into DMC?

602
00:40:26,811 --> 00:40:28,311
He answered...

603
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,611
to my declaration of war.

604
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:43,561
It's Mayor Choi Chang Je.

605
00:40:51,001 --> 00:40:51,922
Hello.

606
00:40:52,002 --> 00:40:52,950
Is it true?

607
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:54,051
(Digital Media City)

608
00:40:54,131 --> 00:40:55,551
I heard all the broadcasting stations...

609
00:40:55,631 --> 00:40:57,120
and media-related companies...

610
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,691
that were supposed to move into DMC...

611
00:40:58,771 --> 00:41:00,070
withdrew their plan.

612
00:41:00,671 --> 00:41:04,041
Are you going to give up on DMC,
which is the landmark...

613
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,711
of New Seoul Town?

614
00:41:07,611 --> 00:41:10,021
The DMC project won't fall through.

615
00:41:10,421 --> 00:41:11,981
Digital Media Center
is a future business...

616
00:41:12,381 --> 00:41:14,791
that Miracle Investment
is conducting with confidence.

617
00:41:16,091 --> 00:41:17,810
We're planning to look...

618
00:41:17,890 --> 00:41:20,430
for other broadcasting stations
and media companies...

619
00:41:20,791 --> 00:41:22,231
who wish to move in
before the construction starts.

620
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:26,171
Keep your word.

621
00:41:26,671 --> 00:41:30,100
I'll keep my word with Seoul's citizens.

622
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:32,620
If there isn't any broadcasting station...

623
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:34,731
willing to move in
before the construction starts,

624
00:41:34,811 --> 00:41:38,081
I'm going to hand over the DMC business
to another company.

625
00:41:40,981 --> 00:41:44,081
To a construction company bigger
and more powerful...

626
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:46,651
than Miracle Investment.

627
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:52,781
You're the one who taught me...

628
00:41:52,861 --> 00:41:54,361
what the DMC project means...

629
00:41:55,990 --> 00:41:57,930
to Choi Chang Je, the mayor of Seoul.

630
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:02,401
Please do a good job. I'm hanging up.

631
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:05,740
What did Mayor Choi say?

632
00:42:09,441 --> 00:42:10,510
He taught me...

633
00:42:12,581 --> 00:42:14,910
why Soonyang interfered so hard
with the companies moving into DMC.

634
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:19,990
Mayor Choi is planning...

635
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:24,561
to hand over the DMC project to Soonyang.

636
00:42:26,831 --> 00:42:28,691
The New Seoul Town project...

637
00:42:28,961 --> 00:42:30,861
comes back to the company
it belongs to, Uncle.

638
00:42:32,461 --> 00:42:34,901
I should give you a boost...

639
00:42:35,430 --> 00:42:36,771
when I have the power.

640
00:42:36,941 --> 00:42:38,321
Once the DMC project becomes successful,

641
00:42:38,401 --> 00:42:40,811
your position in the company
will become more solid.

642
00:42:41,171 --> 00:42:44,261
"Jin Seong Jun didn't get the post
just for being Chairman's grandson."

643
00:42:44,341 --> 00:42:46,180
Let's show them. Yes?

644
00:42:50,651 --> 00:42:53,450
I understand why Grandfather
was against it.

645
00:42:55,021 --> 00:42:57,660
I guess everyone becomes like this
when they're drunk in power.

646
00:42:58,220 --> 00:42:59,260
What?

647
00:43:01,191 --> 00:43:02,930
You can't tell what situation
you're in now, can you?

648
00:43:04,231 --> 00:43:05,300
No.

649
00:43:06,430 --> 00:43:08,271
It's not you but I...

650
00:43:09,131 --> 00:43:10,401
and Soonyang...

651
00:43:11,171 --> 00:43:14,111
that have your life in our hands,
Mayor Choi Chang Je.

652
00:43:16,811 --> 00:43:17,881
Nephew.

653
00:43:18,541 --> 00:43:20,100
New Seoul Town project was dirtied...

654
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:22,350
with real estate speculation
from the start.

655
00:43:23,850 --> 00:43:26,071
Imagine the DMC project
worth almost five billion dollars...

656
00:43:26,151 --> 00:43:27,151
falling through.

657
00:43:28,291 --> 00:43:30,481
Won't you end up as a Seoul mayor
who became a lame duck...

658
00:43:30,561 --> 00:43:32,361
as soon as your term started?

659
00:43:33,461 --> 00:43:34,461
I...

660
00:43:34,990 --> 00:43:38,401
Grandfather is giving you one more chance.

661
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:41,530
Because you're his family.

662
00:43:50,010 --> 00:43:53,350
If you need the power of Soonyang,
don't hesitate to ask.

663
00:43:54,081 --> 00:43:55,510
Come to Jeongsimjae to ask.

664
00:43:57,881 --> 00:43:59,050
As you always did.

665
00:44:11,901 --> 00:44:14,731
You'll buy Soonyang? With your money?

666
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:19,100
Do you think you can buy it with money?

667
00:44:21,370 --> 00:44:22,771
Try it then.

668
00:44:24,541 --> 00:44:26,881
But pay a lot for it.

669
00:44:32,180 --> 00:44:34,791
You're drinking? You should be.

670
00:44:36,521 --> 00:44:40,331
You're about to lose two percent
of Soonyang Corporation's shares.

671
00:44:41,260 --> 00:44:42,961
But don't drink so much yet.

672
00:44:43,961 --> 00:44:46,401
You'll want to drink more
after listening to this.

673
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:50,261
Looking for companies
that can move into DMC is...

674
00:44:50,341 --> 00:44:51,841
rather simple, actually.

675
00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:53,990
We just need to look
for broadcasting stations...

676
00:44:54,070 --> 00:44:56,510
that can be financially independent
without Soonyang's ads.

677
00:44:58,010 --> 00:44:59,131
And what's that station?

678
00:44:59,211 --> 00:45:00,611
There's none.

679
00:45:01,081 --> 00:45:02,111
Seriously...

680
00:45:03,550 --> 00:45:05,801
Stations that have enough influence
to move into DMC...

681
00:45:05,881 --> 00:45:07,751
are all managed by Soonyang.

682
00:45:08,691 --> 00:45:09,921
It got me thinking...

683
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:14,561
that Digital Media City,
your ambitious work,

684
00:45:16,561 --> 00:45:19,260
might be too early for Korea as of now.

685
00:45:20,030 --> 00:45:21,070
What do you mean?

686
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:24,470
I promised to be honest as a partner,
so I'll tell you.

687
00:45:24,841 --> 00:45:27,160
Before deciding on what to invest,

688
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:29,811
I always look at this cheat sheet.

689
00:45:30,611 --> 00:45:31,711
A cheat sheet?

690
00:45:32,041 --> 00:45:34,200
I don't mean complex figures
with difficult names...

691
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:35,930
like the stock market index,
economic growth rate,

692
00:45:36,010 --> 00:45:37,071
and current account balance.

693
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:39,691
I look at the real economic index
that can be seen at once.

694
00:45:53,731 --> 00:45:55,930
- What is that?
- Signboards.

695
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:02,191
Signboards are your cheat sheets?

696
00:46:02,271 --> 00:46:03,801
You can see everything from signboards.

697
00:46:03,881 --> 00:46:05,461
The flow of market, consumers' needs,

698
00:46:05,541 --> 00:46:06,850
and the outlook of an industry.

699
00:46:07,780 --> 00:46:09,820
So signboards, no...

700
00:46:11,350 --> 00:46:15,251
So what does today's cheat sheet say?

701
00:46:15,350 --> 00:46:16,350
Look.

702
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:18,881
All the new signboards on the streets...

703
00:46:18,961 --> 00:46:21,131
are for internet cafés.

704
00:46:21,561 --> 00:46:22,831
Does this make sense?

705
00:46:22,961 --> 00:46:24,950
Is this truly a country
that wants to become the IT powerhouse?

706
00:46:25,030 --> 00:46:27,370
I've never seen an internet café
in New York, not once.

707
00:46:28,901 --> 00:46:30,191
Things have advanced so much,

708
00:46:30,271 --> 00:46:31,421
so why do people still
not have a computer at home...

709
00:46:31,501 --> 00:46:32,941
that they need to go to internet cafés?

710
00:46:33,811 --> 00:46:34,841
This is why...

711
00:46:35,711 --> 00:46:38,941
Digital Media City won't happen.

712
00:46:50,021 --> 00:46:51,281
("99 Pro-gamer Korea Open")

713
00:46:51,361 --> 00:46:54,631
There's nobody to defend it now.

714
00:46:57,361 --> 00:46:58,281
(Internet café)

715
00:46:58,361 --> 00:46:59,282
(Internet café)

716
00:46:59,362 --> 00:47:00,470
(Internet café)

717
00:47:08,070 --> 00:47:09,981
Your cheat sheet is correct, Mr. Oh.

718
00:47:13,651 --> 00:47:16,921
You can run a broadcasting station
without Soonyang's ads.

719
00:47:18,651 --> 00:47:22,620
It might even gain enough influence
to move into DMC.

720
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:24,291
There's such a station?

721
00:47:25,561 --> 00:47:26,561
Where?

722
00:47:29,291 --> 00:47:30,760
(Digital Media City)

723
00:47:31,030 --> 00:47:32,930
Is E-sports even possible?

724
00:47:34,271 --> 00:47:37,470
Game companies weren't interested
in online game relay broadcasting...

725
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:39,341
that we offered.

726
00:47:41,010 --> 00:47:42,041
Gosh.

727
00:47:43,010 --> 00:47:46,081
But maybe
because their target audience matches,

728
00:47:46,981 --> 00:47:48,950
a cartoon broadcasting station
is showing interest.

729
00:47:50,521 --> 00:47:53,671
And they will actively accommodate
our suggestion to minimize...

730
00:47:53,751 --> 00:47:55,671
the profit from ads and earn...

731
00:47:55,751 --> 00:47:56,990
from gamers' subscription fee
and relay rights instead.

732
00:47:57,390 --> 00:47:59,561
- I see.
- Okay.

733
00:48:01,831 --> 00:48:04,760
Right, one more thing.
They have a condition.

734
00:48:04,930 --> 00:48:08,430
Regarding the move into DMC...
Miracle's D double-J.

735
00:48:08,771 --> 00:48:10,800
They want to discuss with you,
the majority shareholder.

736
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:13,410
- The majority shareholder?
- Yes.

737
00:48:27,050 --> 00:48:30,720
(Modern Gallery, Exhibition in progress)

738
00:49:07,791 --> 00:49:11,461
Miracle Investment's majority shareholder,
Jin Do Jun.

739
00:49:14,570 --> 00:49:15,800
What's going on?

740
00:49:17,140 --> 00:49:18,160
I'm here to meet the representative
of a game company...

741
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:20,140
who will move into DMC.

742
00:49:21,341 --> 00:49:22,671
I'm that representative.

743
00:49:26,311 --> 00:49:29,581
My uncle has a broadcasting station
that mainly airs animations.

744
00:49:30,950 --> 00:49:33,120
I heard Miracle Investment was looking
for a gaming channel,

745
00:49:33,450 --> 00:49:34,751
so I asked him for a favour.

746
00:49:38,490 --> 00:49:40,691
Reorganization and composition of staff.

747
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:42,260
They're all completed.

748
00:49:44,361 --> 00:49:46,401
I'm qualified enough to be here, right?

749
00:50:03,151 --> 00:50:04,680
Do you take after your mother?

750
00:50:07,251 --> 00:50:08,921
You were pretty talented in acting.

751
00:50:11,091 --> 00:50:13,331
You said you weren't interested
in succeeding Soonyang.

752
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:16,310
But you're standing in front of me...

753
00:50:16,390 --> 00:50:17,700
as the majority shareholder
of Miracle Investment.

754
00:50:21,501 --> 00:50:22,700
How did you find out?

755
00:50:24,370 --> 00:50:25,441
I told you.

756
00:50:27,111 --> 00:50:29,240
Hyunsung Daily is good
at getting information.

757
00:50:29,870 --> 00:50:31,010
Think about it.

758
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:33,350
The power to move public opinion.

759
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:36,200
Chairman Jin would want
a lot more than that...

760
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:37,850
to join hands with my family.

761
00:50:39,820 --> 00:50:40,890
I'm not the one...

762
00:50:41,921 --> 00:50:43,251
he wants to marry off to you.

763
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:53,131
We're getting ready
to start broadcasting channels...

764
00:50:53,430 --> 00:50:55,100
for Hyunsung Daily's financial
and sports magazines.

765
00:50:55,501 --> 00:50:56,901
I already have my father's permission.

766
00:50:57,501 --> 00:51:00,970
First, we'll move Hyunsung Daily's HQ
to DMC.

767
00:51:01,370 --> 00:51:02,740
Then we'll get ready...

768
00:51:03,311 --> 00:51:04,740
to open the channels at DMC.

769
00:51:05,481 --> 00:51:08,981
Then Miracle won't have any problems
with the construction...

770
00:51:09,251 --> 00:51:10,550
and parcelling out of DMC.

771
00:51:11,481 --> 00:51:13,081
Four channels...

772
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:16,291
and Hyunsung Daily too?

773
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:22,231
Now, do you understand...

774
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:27,370
why you really need me?

775
00:51:29,831 --> 00:51:30,761
What do you say?

776
00:51:30,841 --> 00:51:33,640
I'd say it's an irresistible proposition.

777
00:52:00,070 --> 00:52:01,231
It sure is a proposition...

778
00:52:03,001 --> 00:52:04,001
I can't turn down.

779
00:52:09,519 --> 00:52:10,919
(Exhibition in progress)

780
00:53:30,531 --> 00:53:32,290
What would you like to order, sir?

781
00:53:32,730 --> 00:53:33,761
Well...

782
00:53:35,830 --> 00:53:37,631
Vienna coffee,

783
00:53:38,201 --> 00:53:39,431
without cinnamon.

784
00:53:40,770 --> 00:53:43,841
That's what Min Yeong
always ordered for you. Right?

785
00:53:46,241 --> 00:53:49,511
Is she not here today? I don't see her.

786
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:51,511
Oh, I guess you didn't know.

787
00:53:51,750 --> 00:53:54,620
Min Yeong quit to start studying
for the bar exam.

788
00:53:55,020 --> 00:53:57,221
She said everyone in her family
passed the bar while in school.

789
00:53:59,290 --> 00:54:00,290
Really?

790
00:54:03,190 --> 00:54:04,230
All right, then.

791
00:54:14,370 --> 00:54:15,440
Here.

792
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:20,040
Oh, you can use it next time.

793
00:54:22,210 --> 00:54:23,241
Oh...

794
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:27,721
There will be no next time.

795
00:54:47,140 --> 00:54:48,701
What would you like...

796
00:54:53,781 --> 00:54:56,210
Oh, do you work here part-time?

797
00:54:57,881 --> 00:54:59,000
Like someone once told me,

798
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:02,681
I don't want to take my privileges
for granted anymore, sir.

799
00:55:06,551 --> 00:55:08,861
I thought about it,
and you weren't entirely wrong.

800
00:55:09,460 --> 00:55:12,661
I'm glad I learned the lesson
before I began a career in law.

801
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:17,031
And for that, I'm grateful.

802
00:55:20,540 --> 00:55:24,011
My gosh. You seem quite touched
by what I said, sir.

803
00:55:26,341 --> 00:55:27,661
Your name tag is upside down.

(Seo Min Yeong)

805
00:55:31,781 --> 00:55:33,350
Vienna coffee, please.

806
00:55:36,850 --> 00:55:38,310
How much is it? 1.20 dollars?

807
00:55:38,390 --> 00:55:39,651
It's 1.20 dollars.

808

Without cinnamon, please.

809

You owe me 80 cents.

810
00:55:43,861 --> 00:55:44,931
Yes.

811
00:56:42,381 --> 00:56:43,302
Hello.

812
00:56:43,382 --> 00:56:45,210
I used to work here.

813
00:56:45,290 --> 00:56:47,051
Here's the key for the supply storage room.

814
00:56:47,221 --> 00:56:49,620
- I forgot to return it.
- I see.

815
00:56:50,321 --> 00:56:52,690
Oh, he was here a few moments ago.

816
00:56:53,161 --> 00:56:55,551
Why didn't you tell him that you quit?

817
00:56:55,631 --> 00:56:57,060
He came all the way here for nothing.

818
00:56:57,500 --> 00:56:59,631
Who? Who was here?

819
00:56:59,830 --> 00:57:01,801
You know, the guy who always
gets Vienna coffee.

820
00:57:02,270 --> 00:57:03,971
When I told him you quit,

821
00:57:04,210 --> 00:57:05,940
he looked like he'd just gotten dumped
or something.

822
00:57:44,350 --> 00:57:45,551
It sure is a proposition...

823
00:57:47,250 --> 00:57:48,321
I can't turn down.

824
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:05,600
So what can I offer?

825
00:58:06,870 --> 00:58:08,440
For every deal, there's a price to pay.

826
00:58:16,310 --> 00:58:17,350
You know this too.

827
00:58:19,011 --> 00:58:20,080
We'll be...

828
00:58:20,750 --> 00:58:22,321
good partners.

829
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:29,190
"Good partners?"

830
00:58:33,690 --> 00:58:35,060
So in a nutshell,

831
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:40,401
you want me to do as you say,
let you keep me on a leash,

832
00:58:41,241 --> 00:58:42,971
and obey your family's advice
at all times...

833
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:45,170
just so you can...

834
00:58:46,670 --> 00:58:49,580
become the granddaughter-in-law
of the Soonyang family,

835
00:58:53,881 --> 00:58:56,381
while knowing that I'm being tailed
and watched by people you hired.

836
00:58:57,951 --> 00:58:59,821
- That's...
- To me,

837
00:59:01,460 --> 00:59:03,560
it sounds like you want to own me
before you own Soonyang.

838
00:59:09,261 --> 00:59:11,431
I'm afraid I must decline your proposition,
Ms. Mo Hyeon Min.

839
00:59:13,701 --> 00:59:17,071
I have no interest in becoming your puppet.

840
00:59:50,540 --> 00:59:51,461
(From Jin Seong Jun)

841
00:59:51,541 --> 00:59:54,611
I'm waiting for the day we can meet again.

842
00:59:56,111 --> 00:59:57,181
From Jin Seong Jun.

843
01:00:01,080 --> 01:00:03,321
I didn't know I'd see it again so soon.

844
01:00:04,190 --> 01:00:05,890
Your smile, Ms. Mo Hyeon Min.

845
01:00:08,161 --> 01:00:10,790
We promised to meet again
with smiles on our faces.

846
01:00:17,261 --> 01:00:18,330
Today is...

847
01:00:19,230 --> 01:00:20,370
that day, right?

848
01:00:23,270 --> 01:00:25,661
Oh, yes!

849
01:00:25,741 --> 01:00:27,580
Men's premium underwear!

850
01:00:27,681 --> 01:00:29,601
A five-piece trunk set is...

851
01:00:29,681 --> 01:00:30,710
Hyeong Jun.

852
01:00:31,381 --> 01:00:33,940
I was wondering what you were watching.
A home-shopping channel?

853
01:00:34,020 --> 01:00:35,741
Do not let your guard down.

854
01:00:35,821 --> 01:00:36,742
You startled me.

855
01:00:36,822 --> 01:00:38,540
It'll sell out the moment
you let your guard down.

856
01:00:38,620 --> 01:00:41,690
A spectacular action-thriller that
keeps you on the edge of your seat.

857
01:00:41,861 --> 01:00:43,540
Coming to theaters this summer.

858
01:00:43,620 --> 01:00:46,480
It'll surpass your imagination
in every possible way.

859
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:48,520
A fantastic adventure movie.

860
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:50,730
"Home Shopping."

861
01:00:52,571 --> 01:00:56,701
Hyeong Jun only watches
shopping channels these days.

862
01:00:56,971 --> 01:00:58,991
Hey, you don't need a lot of stuff.

863
01:00:59,071 --> 01:01:02,741
Hey, shopping isn't about
buying things you need.

864
01:01:03,111 --> 01:01:05,080
It's all about buying things you want.

865
01:01:05,611 --> 01:01:07,781
Do you understand, my little brother?

866
01:01:11,221 --> 01:01:13,190
- Do Jun.
- Yes.

867
01:01:13,390 --> 01:01:17,190
Your father wants to speak
to you about something.

868
01:01:25,500 --> 01:01:26,971
Your grandfather was here.

869
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:37,101
Soonyang Public Welfare Foundation
at Soonyang Medical Center...

870
01:01:37,181 --> 01:01:38,551
and HR Development Center.

871
01:01:39,651 --> 01:01:41,321
Your grandfather handed it over to us.

872
01:01:45,091 --> 01:01:46,491
(Power of Attorney, Jin Yoon Ki)

873
01:01:49,690 --> 01:01:51,230
It's a warning.

874
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:54,931
Your grandfather is warning us
not to get greedy...

875
01:01:55,730 --> 01:01:57,230
over Soonyang.

876
01:01:58,370 --> 01:02:01,201
- Father...
- I heard everything.

877
01:02:05,071 --> 01:02:08,140
I'm sorry I couldn't give you a heads up.

878
01:02:09,080 --> 01:02:10,411
Must you...

879
01:02:11,810 --> 01:02:13,250
go against your grandfather's wishes?

880
01:02:19,750 --> 01:02:21,761
I understand why you're worried.

881
01:02:22,591 --> 01:02:24,861
You know better than anyone how scary...

882
01:02:25,931 --> 01:02:27,361
Grandfather can be.

883
01:02:29,861 --> 01:02:31,801
I understand that you're against it.

884
01:02:32,531 --> 01:02:33,600
Let's do it.

885
01:02:34,741 --> 01:02:35,870
I looked into it.

886
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:39,611
I think I can afford to acquire
a cable movie channel...

887
01:02:39,870 --> 01:02:41,381
for DMC.

888
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:43,911
Although it won't be of much help.

889
01:02:45,281 --> 01:02:46,480
Always remember...

890
01:02:47,721 --> 01:02:50,951
that I've got your back, Do Jun.

891
01:02:56,960 --> 01:02:58,161
Honey, did you decide...

892
01:02:59,261 --> 01:03:00,861
to give in and let Do Jun have his way?

893
01:03:01,261 --> 01:03:03,330
Honey, it's...

894
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:05,701
You two.

895
01:03:07,100 --> 01:03:08,401
Promise me.

896
01:03:08,841 --> 01:03:11,670
Do Jun, promise me that
you'll never become like...

897
01:03:12,170 --> 01:03:13,911
everyone on
your father's side of the family.

898
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:18,810
And you, honey. Promise me
that you'll protect Do Jun.

899
01:03:20,310 --> 01:03:22,181
So your father and siblings...

900
01:03:23,321 --> 01:03:25,250
can't hurt our son.

901
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:57,020
The 4th son
of Chairman Jin Yang Cheol, 4-0.

902
01:03:57,281 --> 01:03:59,120
His wife, 4-alpha.

903
01:04:02,321 --> 01:04:03,390
And me,

904
01:04:04,861 --> 01:04:06,060
Jin Do Jun.

905
01:04:08,401 --> 01:04:10,261
They're my parents.

906
01:04:22,511 --> 01:04:24,250
(Groom Jin Seong Jun, Bride Mo Hyeon Min)

907
01:04:26,350 --> 01:04:29,020
I should get a wedding gift
for my eldest grandson.

908
01:04:29,250 --> 01:04:30,480
Is there anything you need?

909
01:04:30,781 --> 01:04:32,551
We'll start out at Jeongsimjae,

910
01:04:33,020 --> 01:04:34,241
so we don't need anything.

911
01:04:34,321 --> 01:04:35,620
No, don't say that.

912
01:04:36,261 --> 01:04:38,661
You are becoming a real adult, Seong Jun.

913
01:04:39,290 --> 01:04:41,330
I must do something for you.

914
01:04:42,460 --> 01:04:43,560
Tell me what you want.

915
01:04:44,770 --> 01:04:45,901
Then, Grandfather.

916
01:04:47,201 --> 01:04:49,901
Please give me the right to play a part...

917
01:04:50,701 --> 01:04:52,611
as one of the adults in the family.

918
01:04:54,411 --> 01:04:56,640
As one of the adults in the family?
It's no big deal.

919
01:04:57,111 --> 01:04:58,480
It's about taking responsibility.

920
01:04:59,710 --> 01:05:02,750
If Seong Jun wishes
to share the burden with us,

921
01:05:03,420 --> 01:05:06,471
he should get some shares too.
Right, Dong Ki?

922
01:05:06,551 --> 01:05:08,620
Yes, sure thing.

923
01:05:10,060 --> 01:05:13,190
So? Did Father say he'd give him some?

924
01:05:13,591 --> 01:05:14,600
Of course.

925
01:05:15,230 --> 01:05:17,631
I think he wants to announce it
at the reception...

926
01:05:18,500 --> 01:05:20,401
when the whole family is there.

927
01:05:22,170 --> 01:05:23,360
Hwa Young.

928
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:27,411
Have a drink with me at the reception.
It's been too long.

929
01:05:28,281 --> 01:05:30,951
Sounds like it'll be a coronation ceremony,
not a wedding.

930
01:05:32,781 --> 01:05:34,381
Will Father really announce...

931
01:05:35,080 --> 01:05:38,250
at the wedding that
Seong Jun is next in line for the throne?

932
01:05:42,120 --> 01:05:45,351
Of course,
Seong Jun is his eldest grandson.

933
01:05:45,431 --> 01:05:48,060
Your father will take great care of him.

934
01:05:48,931 --> 01:05:51,951
All right. Don't be late.

935
01:05:52,031 --> 01:05:53,701
I'll see you at the wedding.

936
01:05:56,901 --> 01:05:58,611
About Seong Jun's fiancée.

937
01:05:58,911 --> 01:06:00,860
I should ask her to visit us tomorrow.

938
01:06:00,940 --> 01:06:04,451
Why? Do you already want to be
an overbearing mother-in-law?

939
01:06:06,051 --> 01:06:08,721
No, I want to be
a good daughter-in-law to you.

940
01:06:09,681 --> 01:06:13,651
All your paintings are too good
to be just kept in this room.

941
01:06:14,690 --> 01:06:16,141
You should have a solo show.

942
01:06:16,221 --> 01:06:18,011
Your granddaughter-in-law runs a gallery.

943
01:06:18,091 --> 01:06:21,420
Gosh, stop. A solo show? Please.

944
01:06:21,500 --> 01:06:23,431
This is just a hobby.

945
01:06:23,661 --> 01:06:26,631
Don't be so modest.
You should think about it, Mother.

946
01:06:27,071 --> 01:06:29,870
Jeong Rae, has Mr. Yang called?

947
01:06:30,270 --> 01:06:33,540
He said he'd be home by lunch.
How come he's not back yet?

948
01:06:33,810 --> 01:06:35,181
Oh, you're right.

949
01:06:35,281 --> 01:06:37,341
Father always calls
if he's going to be home late.

950
01:06:53,690 --> 01:06:54,781
I received a call from Jeongsimjae.

951
01:06:54,861 --> 01:06:57,301
They're asking
when the chairman will be home.

952
01:06:57,971 --> 01:06:59,600
What should I tell them, sir?

953
01:07:11,480 --> 01:07:12,911
We found...

954
01:07:13,750 --> 01:07:16,020
a brain arteriovenous malformation, sir.

955
01:07:18,221 --> 01:07:19,890
Will surgery fix it?

956
01:07:21,060 --> 01:07:22,161
The thing is...

957
01:07:23,591 --> 01:07:27,531
The location is quite risky
if we were to perform surgery.

958
01:07:28,861 --> 01:07:29,931
So I have no choice...

959
01:07:33,770 --> 01:07:35,370
but to rely on luck.

960
01:07:39,511 --> 01:07:40,540
Is that it?

961
01:07:42,281 --> 01:07:45,411
We will do our very best
to monitor it closely.

962
01:07:47,821 --> 01:07:49,651
In my head,

963
01:07:51,991 --> 01:07:54,321
there is a ticking time bomb...

964
01:07:56,190 --> 01:07:57,460
waiting to go off.

965
01:08:46,711 --> 01:08:50,640
(Reborn Rich)

966
01:09:21,480 --> 01:09:22,401
As you ordered,

967
01:09:22,481 --> 01:09:25,310
I prepared a share transfer agreement
for Mr. Jin Seong Jun.

968
01:09:26,711 --> 01:09:27,711
Sir!

969
01:09:28,020 --> 01:09:29,270
(Share Transfer Agreement)

970
01:09:29,350 --> 01:09:32,350
Don't you know whom I love the most...

971
01:09:32,520 --> 01:09:33,690
out of all my children?

972
01:09:33,991 --> 01:09:36,081
What on earth did you do?

973
01:09:36,161 --> 01:09:37,850
The one who can make Soonyang bigger
and better than I can...

974
01:09:37,930 --> 01:09:40,560
will get everything.

975
01:09:41,401 --> 01:09:44,020
That Do Jun takes after me.

976
01:09:44,100 --> 01:09:46,401
Do you think that makes sense?

977
01:09:47,230 --> 01:09:48,901
Grandfather, you were right.

978
01:09:49,640 --> 01:09:52,371
I've given up on my goal
of buying Soonyang with my money.

979
01:09:52,611 --> 01:09:53,940
Do not step over the line!

980
01:09:54,140 --> 01:09:57,951
