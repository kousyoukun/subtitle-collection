00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:57,759
(Reborn Rich)

2
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:00,129
Hyeon Min, you look
absolutely stunning today.

3
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:01,429
Yes, she really does.

4
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:05,670
Of course, you'd expect nothing
less from the Soonyang family.

5
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,120
That must be well over one carat.

6
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:10,270
- What about your honeymoon?
- Here comes the groom-to-be!

7
00:01:11,009 --> 00:01:13,879
- Here comes the groom-to-be!
- Here comes the groom-to-be!

8
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:16,538
- Here comes the groom-to-be!
- Oh, my.

9
00:01:16,539 --> 00:01:17,678
Stop. Don't go any further.

10
00:01:17,679 --> 00:01:20,208
- We'll stop here.
- Oh, dear. I'm thirsty.

11
00:01:20,209 --> 00:01:22,019
- Come in and have a drink.
- No, we should...

12
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,890
- Feed us first.
- Come on, guys.

13
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:25,189
- Hurry up.
- Let's just go.

14
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:28,088
- Gosh, hold on.
- Keep it down!

15
00:01:28,089 --> 00:01:29,359
- The thing is...
- Come on. Let's go.

16
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,429
- Let's go.
- Okay.

17
00:01:45,169 --> 00:01:48,610
Father, Seong Jun and his friends
delivered all the wedding gifts.

18
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:50,660
They're having a feast
at his in-laws' place...

19
00:01:58,750 --> 00:01:59,850
When did you get here?

20
00:01:59,949 --> 00:02:01,660
I was on my way home after playing golf.

21
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:03,789
But I was starving, so I
thought I should stop by.

22
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:07,029
Your son is getting married.

23
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:09,150
You must be so happy that
you don't even have to eat.

24
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:11,429
Oh, Father.

25
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,069
Have you prepared a wedding
gift for your eldest grandson?

26
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:21,999
Will you give him shares
in Soonyang Corporation?

27
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,419
How many?

28
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:30,449
I'm sure Father will just take care of it.

29
00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:33,489
Why are you worried about it?

30
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:37,630
Well, I'm Seong Jun's uncle.

31
00:02:37,889 --> 00:02:40,059
If my gift is too little
compared to his grandfather's,

32
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:41,759
I'll be embarrassed.

33
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,000
Right, Father?

34
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,370
The radish kimchi is perfectly ripe.

35
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:54,559
Looks like we're ready to welcome
the new member of the family.

36
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:58,449
Father.

37
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,259
Can I have more water?

38
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,560
I got it.

39
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:20,329
What is it?

40
00:03:21,299 --> 00:03:22,500
Seong Jun...

41
00:03:24,139 --> 00:03:26,810
is now backed by his in-laws,
who are influential people.

42
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:29,410
So you need not worry about him.

43
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:32,810
Father...

44
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:37,350
will start working on grooming
Seong Jun as his successor.

45
00:03:40,419 --> 00:03:41,989
After all, that is the family's rule.

46
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,389
Primogeniture.

47
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,569
We found...

48
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:57,439
a brain arteriovenous malformation, sir.

49
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,760
(AVM and subarachnoid hemorrhage)

50
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:01,570
The location is quite risky...

51
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:04,549
if we were to perform surgery.

52
00:04:06,609 --> 00:04:07,819
(Medical Diagnosis)

53
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:40,919
Yes, Mr. Oh.

54
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:50,260
Let's just give up.

55
00:04:51,789 --> 00:04:54,059
I was wrong about DMC.

56
00:04:55,129 --> 00:04:58,168
Like HBO and CNN,
I thought cable channels...

57
00:04:58,169 --> 00:05:00,999
would soon beat the national networks.

58
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:03,168
But it can only happen in large
countries with a population...

59
00:05:03,169 --> 00:05:04,269
of 100 million, like the US.

60
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:05,369
No, you're wrong.

61
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:08,309
It may take some time, but
that day will come soon.

62
00:05:08,739 --> 00:05:10,955
The day when cable networks
and various other channels...

63
00:05:10,979 --> 00:05:12,709
would produce content...

64
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:14,449
that would put national TV to shame.
I know it.

65
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:17,389
You don't have time to give such
an absurd spiel like a prophet.

66
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:18,889
We must be objective and face our reality.

67
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:20,650
Objectively speaking,
our reality is that...

68
00:05:21,189 --> 00:05:22,558
Jin Seong Jun will be next in line...

69
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:25,330
for the throne at Soonyang
the moment we give up on DMC.

70
00:05:25,859 --> 00:05:27,628
Then our plan to own Soonyang...

71
00:05:27,629 --> 00:05:29,359
will be nothing but a foolish delusion.

72
00:05:30,669 --> 00:05:32,169
I refuse to give up on DMC.

73
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:38,769
Buy and Sell Home Shopping, the
only profitable cable channel,

74
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:40,650
decided today that they'd
sell off the company.

75
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:43,580
Do you still not understand what it means?

76
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:48,219
Hey, you don't need a lot of stuff.

77
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:52,049
Hey, shopping isn't about
buying things you need.

78
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,390
It's all about buying things you want.

79
00:06:02,559 --> 00:06:04,799
It means the channel needs a new owner.

80
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:06,270
And it's time...

81
00:06:07,499 --> 00:06:09,039
for us to decide who it should be.

82
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:13,140
Mason, you never disappoint.

83
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:14,580
What's with him?

84
00:06:15,179 --> 00:06:17,210
- Where are you going? Hey!
- Come with me!

85
00:06:23,619 --> 00:06:25,989
Are you sure we can meet him here?

86
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:29,389
According to his official schedule,
he's abroad on a business trip now.

87
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:31,289
I bet he doesn't want anyone to know...

88
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:33,830
that he's staying here.

89

(Soonyang Hospital)

90
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,640
If it's top secret,

91
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:46,510
how did you find out?

92
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:53,609

(Soonyang Hospital VIP Patient List)

94
00:07:05,059 --> 00:07:07,760
What I thought was my
grandfather's warning...

95
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:10,869
turned out to be a lottery ticket.

96
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:12,299
And...

97
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:14,970
an unscratched one, at that.

98
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:19,038
Let's go.

99
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,179
(Soonyang Hospital)

100
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,650
Allow me to introduce myself, sir.

101
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:26,510
I am Jin Do Jun.

102
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:34,090
Chairman Jin's youngest grandson?

103
00:07:34,989 --> 00:07:37,359
Yes, I thought you looked familiar.

104
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:40,430
I heard you went to Seoul
National University School of Law.

105
00:07:42,799 --> 00:07:44,498
I told them over and over...

106
00:07:44,499 --> 00:07:46,429
not to let anyone in.

107
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:48,039
How did you get in?

108
00:07:49,539 --> 00:07:52,210
Hey! Anybody outside?

109
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:01,878
Those fools...

110
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:03,979
Your security team did nothing wrong, sir.

111
00:08:07,189 --> 00:08:08,390
I struck a deal with them.

112
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:13,380
I told them I'd send out a press release...

113
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,629
if they didn't let me see you.

114
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,368
Ju Yeong Il, the chairman
of Daeyoung Group,

115
00:08:21,369 --> 00:08:23,340
is undergoing heart valve surgery,

116
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,710
but he chose...

117
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,210
Soonyang Medical Center,
not Daeyoung Medical Center.

118
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:35,119
There is no better way to
prove that Soonyang has...

119
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:39,469
the best cardiothoracic surgery
department in the country.

120
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:43,159
Chairman Jin, that old snake.

121
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,790
He promised me that it'd
be kept confidential.

122
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:50,200
How dare he blindside me like this?
Darn it.

123
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:02,509
My grandfather doesn't
know that I'm here, sir.

124
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:04,279
And...

125
00:09:05,409 --> 00:09:07,050
it should stay that way,

126
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:11,560
because I'm here to tell you
how Daeyoung Distribution...

127
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:15,259
can beat Soonyang Transportation
and become number one...

128

- Hi, congratulations.
- Oh, my. Mr. Mayor.

You took time out of your busy
schedule to join us today.

136
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:48,510
- Thanks, Chang Je.
- It's my pleasure.

137
00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:51,229
I see that the groom's
father is very excited.

138
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:53,728
Is it because your son is getting married?

139
00:09:53,729 --> 00:09:56,159
Or is it because of Father's wedding gift?

140
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:04,409
Gosh, Hwa Young. You have no
idea because you don't have kids.

141
00:10:06,869 --> 00:10:09,540
It's better not to know. It really is.

142
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:11,209
I mean, look at me.

143
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:13,749
I still have to serve my mother-in-law...

144

while walking on eggshells
around my daughter-in-law.

145

Mom has to live long.

146
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:21,019
I'm sorry, Jeong Rae.

147
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:25,388
Hwa Young, that is not what I meant...

148
00:10:25,389 --> 00:10:26,488
- Goodness.
- We'll head in first.

149
00:10:26,489 --> 00:10:27,998
- Let's go.
- You made it, Yoon Ki.

150
00:10:27,999 --> 00:10:29,228
Congratulations.

151
00:10:29,229 --> 00:10:31,069
- Congratulations, Jeong Rae.
- Thank you.

00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:33,070
Thank you all for coming.

153
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:36,200
- Yes, go on in.
- Let's go.

154
00:10:36,499 --> 00:10:37,909
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

155
00:10:39,409 --> 00:10:40,810
- Hey!
- Sir.

156
00:10:43,739 --> 00:10:44,779
Thanks.

157
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:49,950
Okay. My nephew is getting married.

158
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,589
I should prepare this much.

159
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:53,849
- Move! It's our turn.
- All right, next.

160
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:55,460
- She looks gorgeous.
- Hey, hurry.

161
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:58,888
- Hyeon Min! You look stunning.
- For real!

162
00:10:58,889 --> 00:11:00,528
- Look at the camera.
- You look so beautiful.

163
00:11:00,529 --> 00:11:03,398
- You look absolutely gorgeous.
- All right. In 1, 2, 3.

164
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:04,998
- Nice, beautiful.
- You look really stunning.

165
00:11:04,999 --> 00:11:06,769
- Look at the camera.
- Oh, my.

166
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:08,440
Hello.

167
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,200
- Hello.
- Hello.

168
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,210
Would you mind giving us some privacy?

169
00:11:12,409 --> 00:11:13,868
- Not at all.
- My gosh.

170
00:11:13,869 --> 00:11:15,509
I must tell her something.

171
00:11:15,979 --> 00:11:18,180
- My gosh!
- How romantic!

172
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:20,179
- We'll leave you to it, then.
- See you inside!

173
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,780
- See you.
- You look so stunning today.

174
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:24,320
- Congratulations.
- See you.

175
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:41,700
You look beautiful. More
beautiful than I expected.

176
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:48,870
That's not what you wanted
to talk to me about, right?

177
00:12:15,769 --> 00:12:16,940
It's such a shame.

178
00:12:19,139 --> 00:12:21,680
I want to brag about my beautiful bride.

179
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,279
And you would've been
happy to have him here.

180
00:12:27,509 --> 00:12:28,580
Who?

181
00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:31,320
Do Jun.

182
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:34,690
Who?

183
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:40,159
The guy you like.

184
00:12:41,359 --> 00:12:42,460
Jin Do Jun.

185
00:12:59,479 --> 00:13:01,008
Do Jun can't come today.

186
00:13:01,009 --> 00:13:03,220
He doesn't have the guts
to face my grandfather.

187
00:13:04,249 --> 00:13:05,850
You're not waiting for him, are you?

188
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:08,060
Stop.

189
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:12,159
You see, Do Jun...

190
00:13:12,989 --> 00:13:16,129
The DMC deal Miracle took
was too much for him.

191
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:19,440
They've decided to hand it
over to Soonyang Construction.

192
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:21,999
This means...

193
00:13:25,609 --> 00:13:28,540
that I managed to get my
revenge, like you said.

194
00:13:30,139 --> 00:13:31,979
If you knew everything, then why...

195
00:13:39,749 --> 00:13:41,090
I told you.

196
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:43,259
You truly amuse me.

197
00:13:45,359 --> 00:13:48,430
It's funny how you think you're
the only one with a thinking brain.

198
00:13:48,899 --> 00:13:51,970
It's ridiculous that you think
you can always have your way.

199
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:55,369
And you believe that everyone
would like you. That's...

200
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,340
I guess that's kind of cute.

201
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:04,409
Think about it, Hyeon Min.

202
00:14:05,509 --> 00:14:08,350
The world wouldn't be so kind to only you.

203
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,080
Shut your mouth.

204
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:18,389
Walking out the door now doesn't
mean you can undo your decision.

205
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:22,679
People will say you dared to call
off your wedding to Soonyang.

206
00:14:27,499 --> 00:14:29,269
You cannot call off this wedding.

207
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:32,930
You may ditch your pride as it
doesn't bring you any money,

208
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,309
but you can never give up
on your market value...

209
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:37,310
as the only daughter of
the Hyunsung Daily family.

210
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,779
I still find you very amusing.

211
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,519
Is this what you wanted
to talk to me about?

212
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:47,148
- Is that why...
- You didn't choose me as a man,

213
00:14:47,149 --> 00:14:48,290
and the feelings are mutual.

214
00:14:49,359 --> 00:14:51,729
Let's keep things that way
even after the wedding.

215
00:14:56,159 --> 00:14:57,529
You get what I'm saying, right?

216
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:02,700
I figured you should know the
rules before you joined the game.

217
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:19,320
Let's play fair and square.

218
00:15:22,859 --> 00:15:23,960
See you inside.

219
00:15:26,629 --> 00:15:27,659
Hello.

220
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:11,340
Last but not least, the highlight
of the ceremony awaits us.

221
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:13,940
The bride and groom
will now march together.

222
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:17,440
Let us bless the bride and groom...

223
00:16:17,909 --> 00:16:21,320
with a big round of applause.

224
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,249
Promise me one thing.

225
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:26,720
Whatever you do, you will not
dirty the family register.

226
00:16:33,389 --> 00:16:36,399
The bride and groom will now march.

227
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,889
Father, you need to see this.

228
00:17:03,659 --> 00:17:05,560
(Jin Seong Jun's Slush Fund)

229
00:17:06,529 --> 00:17:08,449
I don't think you need
to worry about Seong Jun.

230
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:11,429
He's extremely clever and resourceful.

231
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:15,340
Is this your wedding gift for Seong Jun?

232
00:17:16,139 --> 00:17:18,839
Well, he's only starting out,

233
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,810
so you should train him well.

234
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,480
(Jin Seong Jun's Slush Fund)

235
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:25,929
Did you think I wouldn't know about this...

236
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:29,050
when you knew about it too?

237
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:31,179
You knew?

238
00:17:32,689 --> 00:17:34,819
What? The land-banking for
the New Seoul Town project.

239
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:37,859
You knew that it was all
Seong Jun, not Young Ki?

240
00:17:43,399 --> 00:17:44,629
My grandson, Seong Jun.

241
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,800
I was right there the moment he was born...

242
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,340
instead of his father, who
was in jail at the time.

243
00:17:51,199 --> 00:17:53,070
He is my eldest grandson,

244
00:17:53,909 --> 00:17:55,810
the one and only.

245
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:40,219
Okay. Everyone is ready, right?

246
00:18:40,449 --> 00:18:41,490
All right, here we go.

247
00:18:42,119 --> 00:18:43,989
One, two...

248
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:45,159
Hey, Do Jun!

249
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,439
I'm sorry I'm late.

250
00:18:58,939 --> 00:19:00,139
- All right.
- Hey, come here.

251
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,849
Okay, here we go.

252
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:06,050
Smile, everyone.

253
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:08,749
Well, since we were interrupted anyway...

254
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:11,350
Mr. Mayor, do you mind switching?

255
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:14,589
- With her?
- No, with Mr. Jin.

256
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:16,089
- Smile.
- You two can switch.

257
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:17,759
- You can stay where you are.
- No, why should he...

258
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,059
Why? Do you have nothing
to smile about these days?

259
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:23,759
Mr. Jin Dong Ki, please take
your hands out of your pockets.

260
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,269
- Yes, thank you.
- Grandfather, you were right.

261
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:27,329
Oh, Hyeong Jun.

262
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:28,368
I was foolish.

263
00:19:28,369 --> 00:19:29,800
All right. Give me a bigger smile.

264
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:33,009
I've given up on my goal of
buying Soonyang with my money.

265
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:35,408
All right, here we go. Smile, please!

266
00:19:35,409 --> 00:19:36,480
We'll take it now.

267
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,480
One, two, three.

268
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:51,059
My gosh, thank you all for coming.

269
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:52,959
- Congratulations, sir.
- Congratulations.

270
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:55,090
- Oh, my. You made it too.
- Congratulations, sir.

271
00:19:55,659 --> 00:19:57,198
- Congratulations, sir.
- Congratulations, sir.

272
00:19:57,199 --> 00:19:58,530
- Sir.
- Yes?

273
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:03,800
That little...

274
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:18,948
I tried to keep my cool but couldn't.
I was so fuming mad...

275
00:20:18,949 --> 00:20:21,419
that I ran here as soon as they
removed the IV from my arm.

276
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:25,459
I wanted to take it up with you in person.

277
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:29,260
What's going on? What happened?

278
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:31,800
Look.

279
00:20:34,129 --> 00:20:36,570
Don't you have enough to worry
about with your foolish sons?

280
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,240
Your grandson.

281
00:20:40,639 --> 00:20:42,939
You need to teach him better!

282
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:55,889
You may leave.

283
00:21:01,189 --> 00:21:02,469
Congratulations on your wedding.

284
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,270
As for DMC, I'm sorry.

285
00:21:07,169 --> 00:21:09,089
How dare you think of
going up against Soonyang?

286
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:12,169
You're smart. Why did
you make such a mistake?

287
00:21:13,609 --> 00:21:16,109
Grandfather may think it's
his youngest grandson's prank,

288
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:18,609
but I'm different.

289
00:21:21,619 --> 00:21:23,780
"Don't start a fight that
already has an ending."

290
00:21:25,449 --> 00:21:26,949
That's what you said.

291
00:21:30,459 --> 00:21:32,699
It doesn't look like a fight
that already has an ending.

292
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:44,639
Yes.

293
00:21:51,379 --> 00:21:52,449
Is this true?

294
00:21:55,119 --> 00:21:57,250
The spots at DMC have been filled?

295
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:00,320
Is it true?

296
00:22:02,119 --> 00:22:03,719
That's why I was late to your wedding.

297
00:22:04,659 --> 00:22:06,959
The deadline set out by
Seoul City was today,

298
00:22:07,459 --> 00:22:09,419
so I had to wrap up
everything for the agreement.

299
00:22:10,929 --> 00:22:13,168
Oh, right. I will not hand
over the DMC project...

300
00:22:13,169 --> 00:22:15,169
to Soonyang Group.

301
00:22:19,669 --> 00:22:21,810
What on earth did you do?

302
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:26,409
Are you implying...

303
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:30,719
that there is no sensible, legal way...

304
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:33,530
for me to find companies that
would support the DMC project...

305
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:37,159
because of Soonyang's
meddling cowardly antics?

306
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:41,620
Is that what you meant, Seong Jun?

307
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,179
Tell me.

308
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,780
How can Daeyoung beat Soonyang...

309
00:22:59,609 --> 00:23:03,250
and become number one again
in the distribution industry?

310
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,219
Is there a way?

311
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:11,990
I heard you decided to
sell Daeyoung Distribution.

312
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:14,429
Now's not the time to sell it.

313
00:23:16,399 --> 00:23:17,799
You should acquire another company.

314
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,398
What did you say?

315
00:23:19,399 --> 00:23:21,270
A home shopping channel is up for sale.

316
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,999
You should acquire Buy
and Sell Home Shopping.

317
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,570
Look, SNU Law student.

318
00:23:27,209 --> 00:23:29,849
Don't you know the government's
policy after the financial crisis?

319
00:23:29,939 --> 00:23:31,979
Such an aggressive expansion
strategy through acquisitions...

320
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:33,409
is a relic of a bygone era.

321
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:35,660
Daeyoung has no interest...

322
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,448
in showbiz, where fools
are busy goofing around.

323
00:23:39,449 --> 00:23:40,850
It's not showbiz, sir.

324
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:44,060
It's distribution...

325
00:23:44,859 --> 00:23:45,959
and logistics.

326
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:48,189
Daeyoung's specialty.

327
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,539
It's a mink coat with a
classic, timeless design...

328
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:02,579
offered to you at an
affordable price point.

329
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:03,678
At a glance, you can tell...

330
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:06,609
People no longer buy what they need.
They buy what they want.

331
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:09,979
Thanks to the home shopping
channels that stimulate...

332
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:11,419
the impulse purchase instinct 24-7.

333
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,719
In the comfort of their own home,

334
00:24:14,649 --> 00:24:15,688
with a single click of a button.

335
00:24:15,689 --> 00:24:16,918
That's a given.

336
00:24:16,919 --> 00:24:20,289
As you can see here, the luxurious sheen...

337
00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:23,030
And all home shopping channels...

338
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:25,090
need a logistics company to move goods.

339
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,500
If Daeyoung has a logistics company...

340
00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:29,799
and a home shopping channel as well...

341
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:32,570
It'd be like killing 2 birds with 1 stone,

342
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:36,139
killing 2 flies with 1 slap,

343
00:24:36,639 --> 00:24:39,580
and mashing 2 potatoes with 1 fork.

344
00:24:41,149 --> 00:24:42,149
Am I right?

345
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:48,590
I suggest you acquire a
home shopping channel, sir.

346
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:51,929
Then Daeyoung will soon be...

347
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:56,459
the number one distribution company again.

348
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:02,840
He was very persuasive. So what can I do?

349
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:04,340
I had no choice but to give in.

350
00:25:05,169 --> 00:25:08,109
Daeyoung is joining DMC.

351
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,609
Sit back and wait.

352
00:25:11,949 --> 00:25:14,609
We'll retrieve the number
one title in no time.

353
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,719
I can't see you out.

354
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:25,020
Take care of your health.

355
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:29,560
How petty.

356
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,399
Is this how you treat your guests?

357
00:25:49,649 --> 00:25:51,779
As you ordered, I prepared a
share transfer agreement...

358
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:53,350
for Mr. Jin Seong Jun.

359
00:25:58,959 --> 00:26:00,030
Sir!

360
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:03,560
It's okay. Hold on.

361
00:26:04,629 --> 00:26:06,330
(Share Transfer Agreement)

362
00:26:11,399 --> 00:26:13,270
(Share Transfer Agreement)

363
00:26:13,969 --> 00:26:15,139
Symptoms include...

364
00:26:15,879 --> 00:26:17,208
sudden headaches...

365
00:26:17,209 --> 00:26:20,480
and temporary mobility impairments.

366
00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:24,449
(Share Transfer Agreement)

367
00:26:41,169 --> 00:26:42,169
Mr. Lee.

368
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Yes, sir.

369
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:46,040
About Director Jung...

370
00:26:47,139 --> 00:26:50,139
Let's make sure he'll keep his lips sealed.

371
00:26:53,149 --> 00:26:54,179
Gosh.

372
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,419
Oh, dear.

373
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:02,560
My children can't find out about this yet.

374
00:27:04,359 --> 00:27:05,760
Oh, I'm okay now.

375
00:27:18,869 --> 00:27:20,509
On behalf of the ten
million citizens of Seoul,

376
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:22,139
I'd like to propose a toast.

377
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:25,749
Here's to their forever love. Cheers!

378
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:27,209
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

379
00:27:28,949 --> 00:27:30,378
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations, Seong Jun.

380
00:27:30,379 --> 00:27:31,779
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

381
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:33,550
- My gosh.
- Congratulations, son.

382
00:27:40,459 --> 00:27:41,760
It's sweet.

383
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:50,899
I guess I'm finally growing up...

384
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,340
now that my son is married.

385
00:27:56,139 --> 00:27:58,879
Father. Thanks to all
your help and support,

386
00:27:59,449 --> 00:28:02,550
I managed to raise Seong Jun well,

387
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:05,649
who has now found his better half.

388
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:07,219
Thank you, Father.

389
00:28:10,459 --> 00:28:12,590
Please say a few words.

390
00:28:13,629 --> 00:28:17,629
Seong Jun and his wife will always
remember and heed your advice.

391
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:21,530
I'm sure they'll live a happy life
together and won't let you down.

392
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,198
He's asking for the wedding gift, isn't he?

393
00:28:24,199 --> 00:28:25,809
Does it really need all
the bells and whistles?

394
00:28:25,810 --> 00:28:27,070
The reception is over.

395
00:28:27,570 --> 00:28:29,409
The coronation ceremony has begun.

396
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:38,889
My advice?

397
00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:45,260
Who wants to listen to this old man nag?

398
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:51,760
You're all curious about my
wedding gift for Seong Jun.

399
00:28:54,199 --> 00:28:57,100
Doesn't anyone here not know...

400
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:01,540
how precious Seong Jun is to me?

401
00:29:07,209 --> 00:29:08,750
My gift is...

402
00:29:11,179 --> 00:29:13,689
something Seong Jun had asked for.

403
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:14,889
Oh, my.

404
00:29:18,959 --> 00:29:20,659
- Mr. Lee.
- Yes, sir.

405
00:29:32,639 --> 00:29:33,709
Thank you.

406
00:29:50,889 --> 00:29:52,889
(Transfer Notice, Geochang
Distribution Warehouse)

407
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,899
You asked me to let you take
responsibility as a real adult.

408
00:30:14,949 --> 00:30:16,580
Starting Monday, Seong Jun...

409
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:20,820
will work at Geochang
Distribution Warehouse.

410
00:30:31,429 --> 00:30:33,468
- Father.
- The notice states that he's now...

411
00:30:33,469 --> 00:30:35,199
in charge of the warehouse.

412
00:30:35,899 --> 00:30:38,139
The illegal land-banking
of the New Seoul Town.

413
00:30:39,810 --> 00:30:42,109
And we failed to land
the construction of DMC.

414
00:30:49,119 --> 00:30:51,039
You should take responsibility,
don't you think?

415
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:58,780
That is what a real adult ought to do.

416
00:31:01,659 --> 00:31:04,500
Father, but this is...

417
00:31:08,669 --> 00:31:10,399
As for his shares in the company,

418
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:12,740
we can revisit the issue another time,

419
00:31:13,570 --> 00:31:15,690
but you want him to work at
a distribution warehouse?

420
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,010
As of today,

421
00:31:19,810 --> 00:31:21,280
Soonyang...

422
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:27,820
will no longer follow the
rule of primogeniture.

423
00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:46,310
Either buy all the
shares with your money...

424
00:31:48,270 --> 00:31:50,810
or prove your competence
and abilities as a leader.

425
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:52,310
Suit yourselves.

426
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,919
The one who can make Soonyang
bigger and better than I can...

427
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:00,189
will get everything,

428
00:32:02,919 --> 00:32:04,359
including my shares...

429
00:32:05,889 --> 00:32:07,249
and the right to run the business.

430
00:32:13,699 --> 00:32:14,730
Father.

431
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,570
How could you do this to me? How?

432
00:32:18,669 --> 00:32:21,309
After everything I've done
for you and Soonyang...

433
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:23,080
Young Ki, about your knee...

434
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:27,080
Director Jung at the medical center said...

435
00:32:27,149 --> 00:32:29,029
that the medicines these
days worked very well.

436
00:32:29,719 --> 00:32:31,580
Fixing it will be no problem at all.

437
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:36,159
Don't miss your doctor's appointments.

438
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:42,428
If you don't take care of yourself,

439
00:32:42,429 --> 00:32:44,158
- who will?
- Father!

440
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:47,199
Don't you know whom I love the most...

441
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:48,500
out of all my children?

442
00:32:55,709 --> 00:32:56,909
It's Soonyang.

443
00:33:14,429 --> 00:33:15,589
Dong Ki, do you know anything about this?

444
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:17,760
Hey! Jin Hwa Young, you little...

445
00:33:18,429 --> 00:33:20,929
What are you saying? What would I know?

446
00:33:20,969 --> 00:33:22,669
You know, at the wedding,

447
00:33:22,899 --> 00:33:25,099
Dong Ki and Father talked for a while.

448
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:26,609
- Hey!
- Am I wrong?

449
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:29,810
- Dong Ki, you little...
- I don't know anything!

450
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:33,949
Well, if what Father said is true,

451
00:33:34,179 --> 00:33:36,350
Seong Jun must know the reason.

452
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,980
Hey. Am I wrong, Seong Jun?

453
00:33:41,419 --> 00:33:42,490
That brat...

454
00:34:19,759 --> 00:34:21,189
- Hey!
- Hyeon Min!

455
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:22,929
- My gosh!
- Hyeon Min! Oh, dear.

456
00:34:23,029 --> 00:34:25,428
Hey! What's wrong with her?

457
00:34:25,429 --> 00:34:27,329
Wake up, Hyeon Min. Open your eyes!

458
00:34:27,330 --> 00:34:29,238
My goodness. Why did she faint suddenly?

459
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:31,769
- Honey!
- Seong Jun! Call an ambulance!

460
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:34,008
- Wake up!
- Why did she pass out suddenly?

461
00:34:34,009 --> 00:34:36,169
- Hyeon Min, wake up!
- Hello? We need an ambulance...

462
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:47,619
You need to teach him better!

463
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:51,859
How dare he come at me like that,

464
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:53,790
without even batting an eye?

465
00:34:53,929 --> 00:34:57,029
He has quite a nerve, that kid.

466
00:34:59,029 --> 00:35:03,339
But he sure knows how to
catch the whiff of money,

467
00:35:04,239 --> 00:35:05,339
just like you.

468
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:07,269
He reminds me of the Jin Yang Cheol...

469
00:35:07,270 --> 00:35:09,230
I met at the repair shop
in Incheon 50 years ago.

470
00:35:09,739 --> 00:35:11,139
He takes after you.

471
00:35:11,909 --> 00:35:14,408
I had let my guard down
because none of your sons...

472
00:35:14,409 --> 00:35:15,880
takes after you.

473
00:35:16,779 --> 00:35:19,350
But your grandson got me good.

474
00:35:20,089 --> 00:35:21,750
He sure made me flinch.

475
00:35:33,029 --> 00:35:34,369
I was foolish.

476
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:39,940
I've given up on my goal of
buying Soonyang with my money.

477
00:35:42,679 --> 00:35:43,679
Instead,

478
00:35:45,339 --> 00:35:47,580
I'll use what I learned from you.

479
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:50,119
Okay. Everyone's ready, right?

480
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:51,949
Here we go. We'll take it now.

481
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:54,719
I am your grandson. But even against me,

482
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,360
you used all the authority
and power Soonyang had.

483
00:35:59,659 --> 00:36:02,630
I'll do the same. I will do
everything in my power...

484
00:36:04,330 --> 00:36:05,698
to buy Soonyang.

485
00:36:05,699 --> 00:36:08,868
All right. Let's do
this, for one last time.

486
00:36:08,869 --> 00:36:10,400
- Smile, please!
- Smile, Grandfather.

487
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:11,699
We'll take it now.

488
00:36:11,969 --> 00:36:14,739
One, two, three.

489
00:36:22,619 --> 00:36:23,650
Mr. Lee.

490
00:36:25,179 --> 00:36:26,350
Do you think so too?

491
00:36:27,389 --> 00:36:28,449
Pardon?

492
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:33,330
That Do Jun takes after me.

493
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:35,759
Do you think that makes sense?

494
00:36:48,369 --> 00:36:51,540
It went as you planned, young expat.

495
00:36:54,049 --> 00:36:55,110
Congratulations.

496
00:36:55,449 --> 00:36:58,779
At last, you, the youngest grandson...

497
00:36:59,219 --> 00:37:01,219
have a shot at inheriting Soonyang.

498
00:37:04,659 --> 00:37:06,359
I didn't break the rule of primogeniture...

499
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:08,259
because I needed a shot.

500
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:12,830
I'm still intent on buying the company.

501
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:17,339
I know better than anyone else...

502
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:19,770
just how much...

503
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,310
my dear Soonyang family...

504
00:37:23,639 --> 00:37:25,409
loves and cherishes each other.

505
00:37:26,810 --> 00:37:27,850
What?

506
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:34,290
They'll show faces unlike
any they showed before.

507
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:38,190
Now everyone has a shot...

508
00:37:38,290 --> 00:37:40,690
at becoming the next owner of Soonyang.

509
00:37:42,659 --> 00:37:43,759
That's too much money...

510
00:37:44,759 --> 00:37:46,900
to stay loyal to each other.

511
00:38:12,319 --> 00:38:13,460
It's late.

512
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:18,060
Stop protesting and go to bed.

513
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:20,529
Good for you.

514
00:38:23,299 --> 00:38:26,040
You can tell I'm protesting?

515
00:38:31,909 --> 00:38:34,079
Did you have to go and do that...

516
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:37,549
on a wedding day of all days?

517
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:42,659
How shocked must the new
bride have been to...

518
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:48,359
If he did something wrong, you
could talk to him nicely...

519
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:50,799
and teach him what he should do.

520
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:54,569
You have a way of hurting the kids.

521
00:38:57,540 --> 00:39:00,540
Does coddling them make
them a better person?

522
00:39:01,569 --> 00:39:03,678
His dad is incapable of teaching his son...

523
00:39:03,679 --> 00:39:05,580
when the boy goes off course.

524
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,210
His uncle is terrified...

525
00:39:07,409 --> 00:39:09,579
he'll lose what's his to his nephew...

526
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:11,179
and is wary about everything.

527
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,089
And his aunt...

528
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:17,020
thinks less of her father than
a stick with poop on the end.

529
00:39:19,089 --> 00:39:20,928
Out of the kids we had,

530
00:39:20,929 --> 00:39:23,929
none of them have their
heads screwed on straight.

531
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,040
Then...

532
00:39:33,969 --> 00:39:35,210
what about Yoon Ki?

533
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:39,210
Do you think I don't know?

534
00:39:39,949 --> 00:39:42,679
Why do you not care for Yoon Ki's family?

535
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:45,979
You gave him the foundation
that makes nothing.

536
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:48,649
What do you think people will say of me?

537
00:39:48,650 --> 00:39:51,020
They'll say that I discriminate
the kid that isn't mine.

538
00:39:54,159 --> 00:39:55,790
That nonsense again.

539
00:39:58,159 --> 00:40:00,230
Didn't you hear what I said earlier?

540
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:03,369
The one who makes Soonyang bigger,

541
00:40:04,069 --> 00:40:05,170
whoever that may be,

542
00:40:07,210 --> 00:40:08,969
gets to keep it all.

543
00:40:12,909 --> 00:40:14,449
Remember this one thing.

544
00:40:16,719 --> 00:40:18,119
Our Yoon Ki.

545
00:40:19,319 --> 00:40:22,989
I fed and clothed him the exact
same as I did Young Ki and Dong Ki.

546
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:25,719
I stayed up at night, worried for them all.

547
00:40:27,889 --> 00:40:30,560
It wasn't because I pitied
him for not having a mother.

548
00:40:33,830 --> 00:40:36,170
It was so as not to ruin your reputation.

549
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:40,639
I need you to...

550
00:40:41,810 --> 00:40:43,739
remember that one thing.

551
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:52,719
(Soonyang Hospital)

552
00:41:01,659 --> 00:41:04,830
Director Jung says it's not serious.

553
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:06,799
Don't worry too much.

554
00:41:07,869 --> 00:41:08,869
Okay.

555
00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:12,639
You talk to her parents
so they don't worry.

556
00:41:12,839 --> 00:41:15,369
I should ask her mother...

557
00:41:15,610 --> 00:41:17,880
if she's weak or sick.

558
00:41:18,409 --> 00:41:20,610
I know she had a scare,

559
00:41:20,779 --> 00:41:22,479
but what woman makes her husband...

560
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,350
stay up to nurse her
on their wedding night?

561
00:41:24,850 --> 00:41:26,420
He already has a lot on his plate.

562
00:41:28,290 --> 00:41:29,860
You should go home and rest.

563
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:31,319
Okay.

564
00:41:31,389 --> 00:41:33,259
I put you through a lot today.

565
00:41:33,690 --> 00:41:35,290
We can talk about the rest later.

566
00:41:35,790 --> 00:41:37,199
- Okay.
- Bye.

567
00:42:04,889 --> 00:42:06,560
Tell your mother.

568
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:12,500
I'm not the weak one. Her son is.

569
00:42:13,699 --> 00:42:14,799
What are you doing?

570
00:42:15,469 --> 00:42:17,100
That's what I want to say.

571
00:42:17,739 --> 00:42:19,540
What were you going to do?

572
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:22,770
Were you going to run up and throw a punch?

573
00:42:23,179 --> 00:42:25,778
Why? To take it out on Jin Do Jun?

574
00:42:25,779 --> 00:42:27,710
Were you worried he'd get punched?

575
00:42:29,549 --> 00:42:30,880
Pull yourself together.

576
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:34,319
The rest of your family...

577
00:42:34,650 --> 00:42:37,589
are just waiting for you to mess up.

578
00:42:37,790 --> 00:42:39,529
They're always preparing to drag you down.

579
00:42:39,989 --> 00:42:41,830
Will you feed yourself to them so easily?

580
00:42:42,130 --> 00:42:43,630
I can't accept that.

581
00:42:45,159 --> 00:42:46,270
Remember.

582
00:42:47,130 --> 00:42:49,500
You're only allowed to
show them your back...

583
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,299
when I'm there.

584
00:42:52,969 --> 00:42:55,040
Because we at least are a team.

585
00:43:01,279 --> 00:43:03,080
Can you handle it if I show my back?

586
00:43:05,049 --> 00:43:06,049
I warned you that...

587
00:43:06,449 --> 00:43:08,790
it's bad for you to overestimate yourself.

588
00:43:10,089 --> 00:43:12,690
If you look down on someone,
you end up paying dearly.

589
00:43:19,969 --> 00:43:22,129
This is the only time I'll
let you off for hitting me.

590
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:24,770
It's our wedding night,

591
00:43:25,369 --> 00:43:27,310
so I'll remember it as fierce foreplay.

592
00:43:39,690 --> 00:43:40,790
Can I go?

593
00:43:42,350 --> 00:43:43,588
It's my wedding night.

594
00:43:43,589 --> 00:43:45,759
I'd like to sleep in a
room that smells nice.

595
00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:48,159
To be honest.

596
00:44:08,949 --> 00:44:11,679
(Soonyang Group)

597
00:44:14,449 --> 00:44:15,750
As per the chairman's wishes,

598
00:44:16,290 --> 00:44:20,060
we must reorganize the
subsidiaries you own between you.

599
00:44:21,690 --> 00:44:24,560
First, Vice-Chairman Jin Young Ki.

600
00:44:24,830 --> 00:44:26,698
You'll remain Vice-Chairman...

601
00:44:26,699 --> 00:44:29,099
of Soonyang Corporation and
Electronics, but on top of that,

602
00:44:29,529 --> 00:44:32,540
you now have the same authority
to make decisions as the chairman.

603
00:44:32,699 --> 00:44:33,770
Why?

604
00:44:34,670 --> 00:44:37,339
So he can hold me responsible
and exile me too...

605
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:39,009
if business profits go down?

606
00:44:44,750 --> 00:44:46,080
Executive Director Jin Dong Ki.

607
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:49,319
You'll serve as vice-chairman
of the whole group,

608
00:44:49,589 --> 00:44:51,488
and manage Heavy Machinery, Chemicals,

609
00:44:51,489 --> 00:44:54,360
the stock firm, and
Soonyang's asset management.

610
00:44:55,029 --> 00:44:56,330
If he's vice-chairman,

611
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:59,669
does that make him Young Ki's equal?

612
00:44:59,670 --> 00:45:01,730
Why would you say we're equals?

613
00:45:01,830 --> 00:45:04,269
So what if I'm in charge of a whole lot?

614
00:45:04,270 --> 00:45:06,199
None of them are worth anything.

615
00:45:06,909 --> 00:45:08,940
Heavy Machinery and
Chemicals put together...

616
00:45:09,139 --> 00:45:11,239
make less than 60 percent
of what Electronics does.

617
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:13,810
Soonyang Department Store...

618
00:45:13,909 --> 00:45:16,049
will merge with the hotel
and supermarket chains.

619
00:45:16,179 --> 00:45:19,119
The new Soonyang Distribution
Group will be a separate entity.

620
00:45:19,279 --> 00:45:21,889
The necessary procedures
will be taken care of soon.

621
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:24,290
What does that mean?

622
00:45:24,719 --> 00:45:26,689
He's giving me a separate group...

623
00:45:26,690 --> 00:45:29,289
because I'm married and no
longer part of this family?

624
00:45:29,290 --> 00:45:31,258
It's not just a small group.

625
00:45:31,259 --> 00:45:33,029
The hotel chain includes the condos...

626
00:45:34,029 --> 00:45:35,799
Wait, the golf courses too?

627
00:45:36,699 --> 00:45:39,739
You're taking the main
pillar of the business.

628
00:45:40,009 --> 00:45:42,610
You still get to live in the main house.

629
00:45:48,049 --> 00:45:49,449
The separation is a demand...

630
00:45:49,779 --> 00:45:51,679
made by the government and IMF.

631
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:54,689
The future of your group
depends on whether...

632
00:45:54,690 --> 00:45:57,619
the supermarket chain goes nationwide.

633
00:45:57,790 --> 00:45:58,889
Chairman Jin...

634
00:46:00,389 --> 00:46:02,889
has given you a chance
to show what you can do.

635
00:46:06,330 --> 00:46:07,929
To separate the subsidiaries,

636
00:46:08,730 --> 00:46:11,040
we must sort who owns how much...

637
00:46:11,699 --> 00:46:13,770
and who owes how much.

638
00:46:17,279 --> 00:46:18,710
That is the amount...

639
00:46:18,810 --> 00:46:21,650
you must repay your brothers' subsidiaries.

640
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:24,480
This much?

641
00:46:35,029 --> 00:46:36,698
So you had a hard time?

642
00:46:36,699 --> 00:46:37,899
I did.

643
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:39,560
If you need that much money,

644
00:46:39,699 --> 00:46:42,369
you should talk to CEO Oh Se
Hyeon of Miracle Investment.

645
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:49,069
It's a company that has the
most cash flow in Korea now.

646
00:46:51,409 --> 00:46:53,480
- Put me down.
- Oh, dear...

647
00:46:53,949 --> 00:46:55,679
You want me to ask Do Jun for help?

648
00:46:55,850 --> 00:46:56,880
What?

00:58:32,139 --> 00:58:33,879
The price plummeted down to five dollars...

813
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:36,179
after hitting a record of 300 dollars.

814
00:58:36,509 --> 00:58:38,849
It was the most beloved item that
faced the most wretched ending...

815
00:58:38,850 --> 00:58:40,589
in the history of the stock market.

816
00:58:42,020 --> 00:58:44,020
A symbol of the dot-com bubble era,

New Data Technology.

818
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:52,499
Wait, do you already
have an investment plan?

819
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:53,560
I doubt it.

820
00:58:54,830 --> 00:58:56,400
Mr. Majority Shareholder here thinks...

821
00:58:56,699 --> 00:58:59,839
the dot-com fad is a speculative bubble.

822
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:02,139
Miracle won't invest in it, Rachael.

823
00:59:03,710 --> 00:59:04,710
No.

824
00:59:04,711 --> 00:59:06,778
You clearly told me last
time that you won't...

825
00:59:06,779 --> 00:59:09,079
I clearly said I will invest
when the flower wilts...

826
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:10,408
and it comes to fruition.

827
00:59:10,409 --> 00:59:12,480
- When is that?
- Now.

Let me report back on 4-2.

832
00:59:39,210 --> 00:59:42,080
It looks like he has taken
interest in stock trading.

833
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:44,119
He's often visiting stock firms,

834
00:59:44,449 --> 00:59:46,118
and I could tell through his phone calls...

835
00:59:46,119 --> 00:59:48,790
that he invested a huge
amount in a venture business.

836
00:59:50,150 --> 00:59:52,819
Yes, what was the name again?

837
00:59:54,060 --> 00:59:56,029
New Data Technology?

838
00:59:57,860 --> 01:00:00,230
It's a newly listed IT venture company.

839
01:00:01,170 --> 01:00:04,670
They began at 1.50 dollars,
and stock firms presume...

840
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:06,739
it'll reach up to 40 dollars.

841
01:00:07,139 --> 01:00:09,499
Wait, then 300,000 dollars will
give me 10 million dollars?

842
01:00:11,409 --> 01:00:12,480
Are you sure about this?

843
01:00:14,409 --> 01:00:15,509
How is their business?

844
01:00:16,779 --> 01:00:17,850
IT businesses are...

845
01:00:18,380 --> 01:00:20,719
the growth driver of
the current government.

846

Where do you think the
money they put out...

847
01:00:24,819 --> 01:00:26,290
before the general election will go?

848
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:30,189
Above all, the research team
of Soonyang Investment is...

849
01:00:30,190 --> 01:00:31,910
the top of the industry, Vice-Chairman Jin.

850
01:00:34,369 --> 01:00:38,369
Where does Do Jun get all this information?

851
01:00:40,339 --> 01:00:44,179
That young kid is the owner
of Miracle Investment?

852
01:00:45,909 --> 01:00:46,980
Did Father...

853
01:00:48,279 --> 01:00:50,980
break the rule of
primogeniture because of him?

854
01:00:53,819 --> 01:00:55,899
Is the guy that I planted
next to Do Jun doing well?

855
01:00:55,989 --> 01:00:58,149
He's been doing well since
he returned from his break.

856
01:00:58,219 --> 01:00:59,779
Do Jun is not suspicious of him either.

857
01:01:00,690 --> 01:01:02,770
Call the Business Department
of the investment firm.

858
01:01:02,830 --> 01:01:05,960
Tell them to do everything to buy
the stocks of New Data Technology.

859
01:01:08,969 --> 01:01:12,900
So? How much do we need right now, Ms. Im?

860
01:01:13,199 --> 01:01:14,710
A total of 400 million dollars.

861
01:01:18,179 --> 01:01:19,809
It costs 120 million dollars...

862
01:01:19,810 --> 01:01:21,755
to make a nationwide chain
network for Soonyang Mart.

863
01:01:21,779 --> 01:01:23,908
Also, we have to pay back
Soonyang Electronics...

864
01:01:23,909 --> 01:01:25,649
and Soonyang Heavy Machinery...

865
01:01:25,650 --> 01:01:28,520
for share acquisition, 150
and 130 million, respectively.

866
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:31,889
How much more can we borrow from the bank?

867
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:36,428
We've already taken out loans to
our limit from our primary bank.

868
01:01:36,429 --> 01:01:38,199
I see. That leaves me no choice.

869
01:01:38,330 --> 01:01:40,230
I need to look into funds from Myeong-dong.

870
01:01:40,730 --> 01:01:43,599
The private loan industry agreed
not to put any cash out...

871
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:45,298
into the market right now.

872
01:01:45,299 --> 01:01:48,809
The interest rate for banks is
speculated to go up to 25 percent.

873
01:01:48,810 --> 01:01:51,639
So they'll hold it back
until that moment comes...

874
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:54,080
What's the alternative?

875
01:01:54,580 --> 01:01:55,580
I'm sorry.

and Soonyang Heavy Machinery.

881
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:12,629
If they would postpone the
time limit of payment...

882
01:02:12,630 --> 01:02:14,568
or reduce the interest rate,

883
01:02:14,569 --> 01:02:16,400
it'll help us hold out.

884
01:02:22,069 --> 01:02:23,568
Sure, I'll do that for you.

892
01:02:45,929 --> 01:02:47,259

Does he have a knack for
investing unlike his young age?

then you can pay the price.

As long as I'm the CEO of Miracle,

931
01:04:59,259 --> 01:05:02,699
we won't cause any influence
over the succession of Soonyang.

with a price, Ms. Jin.

as the collateral.

938
01:05:26,889 --> 01:05:28,460
Thirty percent of my shares?

939
01:05:31,029 --> 01:05:34,399
Are you saying the department
store is only worth that little?

940
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:35,900
I'm taking them only as collateral...

Oh, my.

960
01:06:31,119 --> 01:06:34,790
It'll surely rise up
to at least 40 dollars.

Forty...

962

- Wait.

01:07:01,350 --> 01:07:02,350
Excuse me.

971
01:07:15,969 --> 01:07:16,969
What?

972
01:07:18,369 --> 01:07:20,569
Hwa Young paid back what she owes you too?

973
01:07:20,799 --> 01:07:23,119
She must have paid back what
she owes the Electronics too.

974
01:07:24,509 --> 01:07:27,908
Man, that means we cannot
revert the separation...

975
01:07:27,909 --> 01:07:29,710
of Hwa Young's affiliations.

976
01:07:32,779 --> 01:07:36,089
Our father has an only
daughter with great initiative.

977
01:07:37,250 --> 01:07:41,190
Where did she find such
a huge amount of money?

978
01:07:42,630 --> 01:07:44,159
Could it be Father?

979
01:07:48,600 --> 01:07:49,699
Miracle?

980
01:07:52,139 --> 01:07:55,540
So the 400 million dollars
came out of Do Jun's pocket?

981
01:07:59,509 --> 01:08:03,380
They must have requested
collateral for that huge amount.

982
01:08:04,580 --> 01:08:06,750
If she put out a percentage of her shares,

983
01:08:07,549 --> 01:08:10,389
her managerial rights may fall
in danger after the merger.

984
01:08:11,560 --> 01:08:14,889
She went on her way with
8,000 employees to look after.

985
01:08:16,529 --> 01:08:18,830
I'm sure she has a plan.

986
01:08:23,429 --> 01:08:25,269
The department store, the
hotel, and the golf club.

987
01:08:25,270 --> 01:08:27,469
Find all the cash we can
in the Distribution Group.

988
01:08:28,039 --> 01:08:31,240
I'm going to invest everything
in New Data Technology.

989
01:08:32,139 --> 01:08:34,279
CEO Jin, that sounds a little dangerous.

990
01:08:34,280 --> 01:08:37,249
You heard the Research Team
of Soonyang Investment too.

991
01:08:37,749 --> 01:08:40,320
They said it'll go up to
40 dollars within 1 month.

992
01:08:40,820 --> 01:08:42,919
It'll rise up by fourfold!

993
01:08:43,419 --> 01:08:46,258
Also, the Business Department
of Soonyang Investment...

994
01:08:46,259 --> 01:08:48,459
who has the highest
earnings in the industry...

995
01:08:48,660 --> 01:08:51,100
has been purchasing the
shares of New Data Technology.

996
01:08:52,400 --> 01:08:54,605
While Vice-Chairman Jin Dong Ki,
that man who knows these things,

997
01:08:54,629 --> 01:08:56,428
is earning fourfold, fivefold of profit,

998
01:08:56,429 --> 01:08:58,440
should I sit around doing nothing?

999
01:08:59,740 --> 01:09:01,109
But Ms. Jin,

1000
01:09:01,110 --> 01:09:03,940
you cannot make private use of
the department store's fund...

1001
01:09:05,179 --> 01:09:06,809
I'm not keeping this for myself.

1002
01:09:06,810 --> 01:09:09,479
I'll return the principal and the profit...

1003
01:09:09,480 --> 01:09:11,949
back to the department
store in just a month.

1004
01:09:11,950 --> 01:09:13,179
Don't worry about it.

1005
01:09:14,079 --> 01:09:16,249
Make sure you find three
million dollars at all costs,

1006
01:09:16,320 --> 01:09:19,560
then invest it into New Data Technology.

1007
01:09:23,089 --> 01:09:25,259
(CEO Jin Hwa Young)

1008
01:09:31,169 --> 01:09:33,770
Mr. Oh, it's me, Jin Hwa Young.

1009
01:09:35,039 --> 01:09:36,469
You bought some too?

1010
01:09:37,440 --> 01:09:38,760
You put in three million dollars?

1011
01:09:41,150 --> 01:09:44,520
CEO Jin, listen up.

1012
01:09:45,650 --> 01:09:48,888
Once the stocks go up to
40 dollars in a month,

1013
01:09:48,889 --> 01:09:50,789
you have to sell them without looking back.

1014
01:09:51,360 --> 01:09:52,920
There is a false report going around...

1015
01:09:53,259 --> 01:09:55,388
between people in finances saying...

1016
01:09:55,389 --> 01:09:57,160
it'll go up to 100 and 200 dollars,

1017
01:09:57,389 --> 01:09:59,298
but do not look back.

1018
01:09:59,299 --> 01:10:01,370
You must focus on managing
the department store.

1019
01:10:01,700 --> 01:10:03,580
I am sharing this with
you not as a creditor...

1020
01:10:03,929 --> 01:10:04,969
A partner.

1021
01:10:05,539 --> 01:10:07,539
But as a partner.

1022
01:10:09,539 --> 01:10:12,280
How long will this rally
of new top price continue?

1023
01:10:14,780 --> 01:10:16,450
Up to about 300 dollars.

1024
01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:19,379
Come on, not 30, but 300 dollars?

1025
01:10:20,079 --> 01:10:22,650
Says who? Was this in a finance report?

1026
01:10:23,350 --> 01:10:24,419
Mr. Oh.

1027
01:10:24,620 --> 01:10:26,089
- Me?
- Mason?

1028
01:10:26,660 --> 01:10:29,759
If what's moving the stock price
isn't their technology or business,

1029
01:10:30,459 --> 01:10:32,419
then the answer to this
soaring price is evident.

1030
01:10:33,129 --> 01:10:34,230
Hosts of manipulators.

1031
01:10:34,669 --> 01:10:35,669
Yes.

1032
01:10:36,629 --> 01:10:38,538
They'll need the money...

1033
01:10:38,539 --> 01:10:40,498
by the nomination of next
year's general election.

1034
01:10:40,499 --> 01:10:42,639
If the level of increase remains the same,

1035
01:10:42,709 --> 01:10:44,039
then it'll go up to 300 dollars.

1036
01:10:44,980 --> 01:10:46,439
But why 40 dollars?

1037
01:10:46,440 --> 01:10:49,249
Why did you tell her to
pull out at 40 dollars?

1038
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:53,779
She put in 3 million, so
she'll make 12 million.

1039
01:10:53,780 --> 01:10:54,950
Exactly four times.

1040
01:10:55,990 --> 01:10:57,320
That's good enough.

1041
01:10:57,919 --> 01:11:00,160
It'll make her happy for making money...

1042
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:01,929
and feel confident about investing.

1043
01:11:08,129 --> 01:11:10,169
Miracle Investment, Rachael speaking.

1044
01:11:11,469 --> 01:11:12,968
It's Vice-Chairman Jin Dong Ki.

1045
01:11:12,969 --> 01:11:14,070
One second.

1046
01:11:14,639 --> 01:11:17,009
It's the secretary of
Vice-Chairman Jin Young Ki.

1047
01:11:17,240 --> 01:11:18,539
He's looking for you, Mr. Oh.

1048
01:11:23,049 --> 01:11:24,780
I called you out today...

1049
01:11:25,749 --> 01:11:27,379
to be a good brother.

1050
01:11:30,549 --> 01:11:32,219
Hwa Young, no.

1051
01:11:32,459 --> 01:11:34,629
CEO Jin Hwa Young borrowed
money from you, right?

1052
01:11:35,660 --> 01:11:37,230
I'll pay that back.

1053
01:11:37,459 --> 01:11:38,560
In return,

1054
01:11:38,959 --> 01:11:41,629
you can give me the shares of
Soonyang Department Store...

1055
01:11:42,870 --> 01:11:43,999
you got as collateral.

1056
01:11:45,039 --> 01:11:46,569
I'm guessing you weren't happy...

1057
01:11:46,570 --> 01:11:49,509
that the department store
separated from Soonyang Group.

1058
01:11:49,740 --> 01:11:52,579
The IMF doesn't know what the
situation in Korea is like.

1059
01:11:54,579 --> 01:11:56,079
But at this point in time,

1060
01:11:57,310 --> 01:11:59,310
large corporations must
stick together to survive.

1061
01:11:59,579 --> 01:12:02,450
We must push and pull each other forward.

1062
01:12:03,389 --> 01:12:05,659
I'm sure you've heard the
term Korean democratization.

1063
01:12:05,660 --> 01:12:06,759
It's the same thing.

1064
01:12:06,820 --> 01:12:10,730
Korea needs a Korean way of
economic democratization.

1065
01:12:10,789 --> 01:12:13,149
Giving work to specific places.
Corrupt ties with politics.

1066
01:12:13,200 --> 01:12:14,798
Reckless business diversification.
Illegal managerial succession.

1067
01:12:14,799 --> 01:12:15,829
Things like these?

1068
01:12:16,999 --> 01:12:19,079
You do not want the separation
of the affiliation...

1069
01:12:19,339 --> 01:12:23,270
because you're afraid you
won't inherit as much.

1070
01:12:24,709 --> 01:12:26,979
Hand over her collateral to me.

1071
01:12:26,980 --> 01:12:28,410
I demand 800 million dollars.

1072
01:12:32,320 --> 01:12:34,080
You're going to get
twice as much from this?

1073
01:12:34,579 --> 01:12:38,190
This is 30 percent of the shares
of your sister's department store.

1074
01:12:39,190 --> 01:12:40,990
I'll need at least twice as much...

1075
01:12:42,030 --> 01:12:43,660
to betray my partner.

1076
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:52,469
I'll give you twice as much.

1077
01:12:53,070 --> 01:12:55,370
Give me the shares for
the department store.

1078
01:12:56,539 --> 01:12:59,509
I believe Chairman Jin Yang
Cheol wanted this separation.

1079
01:12:59,839 --> 01:13:01,980
Do you think he'll be
happy if the collateral...

1080
01:13:02,579 --> 01:13:03,579
ends up in your hands?

1081
01:13:05,919 --> 01:13:08,789
I'm doing everything for my father's sake.

1082
01:13:08,889 --> 01:13:11,019
She is my sister, but CEO Jin Hwa Young...

1083
01:13:11,020 --> 01:13:12,520
can only run the department store.

1084
01:13:13,160 --> 01:13:15,529
She's not competent enough to
run the Distribution Group.

1085
01:13:15,530 --> 01:13:18,328
If I walked in her shoes,
I would have cashed out...

1086
01:13:18,329 --> 01:13:19,559
the affiliations that don't bring in money.

1087
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:20,660
Well, anyway.

1088
01:13:22,770 --> 01:13:25,770
This is the only way to keep
the department store together.

1089
01:13:28,169 --> 01:13:30,469
Give me the collateral, Mr. Oh.

1090
01:13:33,910 --> 01:13:36,749
I'll think about it if you
give me four times as much.

1091
01:13:47,190 --> 01:13:49,490
Are you saying you aren't
looking to sell those?

1092
01:13:50,389 --> 01:13:53,999
I see. You weren't after the money.

1093
01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:56,828
You wanted the managerial rights
of the department store, Mr. Oh...

1094
01:13:56,829 --> 01:13:59,639
No, it's not you.

1095
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:02,240
Is this Do Jun?

1096
01:14:02,469 --> 01:14:05,310
Onroad, the top internet
company of Korea...

1097
01:14:05,410 --> 01:14:08,509
just announced a technical
tie-up with New Data Technology.

1098
01:14:08,749 --> 01:14:10,078
When the announcement was made,

1099
01:14:10,079 --> 01:14:12,418
New Data Technology's
stock price skyrocketed...

1100
01:14:12,419 --> 01:14:14,820
and ended the day at 55 dollars.

1101
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:16,748
The stock market says...

1102
01:14:16,749 --> 01:14:20,020
if this level of increase continues,

1103
01:14:20,259 --> 01:14:22,729
they will become the first company
in the history of KOSDAQ...

1104
01:14:22,730 --> 01:14:25,060
to reach 100 dollars within the month.

1105
01:14:25,999 --> 01:14:29,770
The price went over 40 dollars.
It's skyrocketing.

1106
01:14:31,740 --> 01:14:33,100
I'm starting to wonder.

1107
01:14:34,669 --> 01:14:37,410
Will she feel satisfied after
getting what she wanted?

1108
01:14:37,740 --> 01:14:38,839
Or...

1109
01:14:41,310 --> 01:14:44,009
will she feel at a loss for losing
something she could have had?

1110
01:14:46,749 --> 01:14:48,289
I wonder which is more significant.

1111
01:14:49,650 --> 01:14:50,650
("New Data Technology,
Stock Prices Skyrocket!")

1112
01:14:50,651 --> 01:14:53,919
Do you know how much I lost
after selling this at 40 dollars?

1113
01:14:56,389 --> 01:14:57,928
In just a few hours,

1114
01:14:57,929 --> 01:14:59,029
(CEO Jin Hwa Young)

1115
01:14:59,030 --> 01:15:00,700
I lost 4.5 million dollars.

1116
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:02,829
I lost 4.5 million dollars!

1117
01:15:04,669 --> 01:15:06,270
The rationality of the human mind...

1118
01:15:06,669 --> 01:15:08,789
always tells us to focus on
the satisfaction we have.

1119
01:15:10,110 --> 01:15:11,370
But desire...

1120
01:15:12,240 --> 01:15:14,521
always stand on the side of
the things we could have had.

1121
01:15:14,780 --> 01:15:17,309
New Data Technology continues
to hit a new high...

1122
01:15:17,310 --> 01:15:19,149
for 55 days in a row.

1123
01:15:19,150 --> 01:15:21,249
Look at that. Drop.

1124
01:15:22,889 --> 01:15:24,649
We'll conduct an on-site audit...

1125
01:15:24,650 --> 01:15:26,219
for the new four branches.

1126
01:15:26,490 --> 01:15:28,660
How does next week sound, Ms. Jin?

1127
01:15:29,360 --> 01:15:30,589
Drop.

1128
01:15:31,190 --> 01:15:32,200
Excuse me.

1129
01:15:33,160 --> 01:15:34,160
Ms. Jin?

1130
01:15:34,660 --> 01:15:36,570
- Ms. Jin?
- Ms. Jin?

1131
01:16:01,320 --> 01:16:02,959
Aunt, Mr. Oh told me...

1132
01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:05,600
that you invested in New Data Technology.

1133
01:16:06,459 --> 01:16:07,999
Is he really an expert investor?

1134
01:16:08,230 --> 01:16:09,569
Do you know how much I lost...

1135
01:16:09,570 --> 01:16:11,169
after I listened to that man's advice?

1136
01:16:11,639 --> 01:16:14,570
I see. What a relief. I was worried.

1137
01:16:17,709 --> 01:16:21,009
There are hosts of manipulators
behind New Data Technology.

1138
01:16:21,749 --> 01:16:23,679
- Manipulators?
- Yes.

1139
01:16:24,410 --> 01:16:27,120
I hear they'll take the
flight up to 300 dollars.

1140
01:16:27,780 --> 01:16:29,819
But who knows when this
defective aircraft...

1141
01:16:29,820 --> 01:16:30,919
will take the plunge?

1142
01:16:31,589 --> 01:16:33,459
But I guess it's high risk, high return.

1143
01:16:34,789 --> 01:16:36,289
So it will go up further?

1144
01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:40,400
This isn't the time for you to
make such aggressive investment.

1145
01:16:40,860 --> 01:16:42,070
What do you mean?

1146
01:16:53,539 --> 01:16:56,249
Two uncles each came to see Mr. Oh.

1147
01:16:56,950 --> 01:16:59,578
I guess they were worried
about the collateral.

1148
01:16:59,579 --> 01:17:03,490
They wanted to buy the
department store's shares.

1149
01:17:05,589 --> 01:17:06,589
And?

1150
01:17:07,560 --> 01:17:09,259
Are you saying he handed it over?

1151
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:12,129
That's impossible, Aunt.

1152
01:17:13,030 --> 01:17:14,230
We're family.

1153
01:17:16,629 --> 01:17:19,240
But Mr. Oh is different.
You know that, right?

1154
01:17:20,200 --> 01:17:23,139
He's willing to do anything
if you can pay the price.

1155
01:17:24,469 --> 01:17:26,615
Do not lay your hand on the
department store's shares.

1156
01:17:26,639 --> 01:17:29,810
I don't care who touches it,
but I will not forgive them.

1157
01:17:33,179 --> 01:17:34,950
Don't stand around like a creditor. Go.

1158
01:17:35,089 --> 01:17:38,189
That darned money? I'll pay it back.

1159
01:17:38,190 --> 01:17:39,559
(CEO Jin Hwa Young)

1160
01:17:39,560 --> 01:17:40,620
Good grief.

1161
01:17:41,990 --> 01:17:43,030
My gosh.

1162
01:17:45,299 --> 01:17:46,360
I knew it, Aunt.

1163
01:17:48,799 --> 01:17:50,969
You surely are different from us.

1164
01:17:52,700 --> 01:17:53,770
Gosh.

1165
01:18:06,749 --> 01:18:08,179
Tell Director Im to come in now.

1166
01:18:13,759 --> 01:18:15,759
When desire is defeated,
it turns into anger...

1167
01:18:16,990 --> 01:18:19,259
and pulls the bowstring tightly.

1168
01:18:34,980 --> 01:18:36,409
What's the settlement
cost for next month...

1169
01:18:36,410 --> 01:18:38,170
from the businesses in
the department store?

1170
01:18:38,280 --> 01:18:40,725
- 140 million dollars, ma'am.
- Make them into postdated checks.

1171
01:18:40,749 --> 01:18:42,789
- Sorry?
- I'm going to invest...

1172
01:18:43,850 --> 01:18:46,419
those 140 million dollars
into New Data Technology.

1173
01:18:47,759 --> 01:18:49,128
CEO Jin, that's the department store's...

1174
01:18:49,129 --> 01:18:51,088
I am Soonyang Department Store,

1175
01:18:51,089 --> 01:18:52,959
and Soonyang Department Store is me!

1176
01:18:56,770 --> 01:18:57,870
Invest...

1177
01:19:00,070 --> 01:19:01,270
all 140 million dollars.

1178
01:19:07,740 --> 01:19:09,280
When the arrow leaves the bow,

1179
01:19:11,110 --> 01:19:13,079
it flies over to the
target without hesitation.

1180
01:19:15,820 --> 01:19:16,889
And that target is...

1181
01:19:21,959 --> 01:19:23,129
always one's own self.

1182
01:19:27,129 --> 01:19:31,129
(Reborn Rich)

1183
01:20:01,730 --> 01:20:03,828
Ms. Jin, you have made enough.

1184
01:20:03,829 --> 01:20:05,399
You should stop investing in stocks...

1185
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:07,499
It'll go up to 300 dollars.

1186
01:20:07,839 --> 01:20:09,869
There will be a photoshoot.

1187
01:20:09,870 --> 01:20:11,310
The theme is a female prosecutor.

1188
01:20:11,639 --> 01:20:13,810
I'm Prosecutor Seo Min Yeong.
Who's calling?

1189
01:20:14,209 --> 01:20:17,310
You want me to investigate CEO
Jin Hwa Young's embezzlement?

1190
01:20:17,709 --> 01:20:21,248
So we're here today as a
prosecutor and an informant.

1191
01:20:21,249 --> 01:20:22,249
Why not?

1192
01:20:22,950 --> 01:20:23,990
Am I not allowed to?

1193
01:20:24,089 --> 01:20:26,020
Jin Do Jun, that jerk!

1194
01:20:26,259 --> 01:20:28,159
Pull yourself together, Jin Hwa Young!

1195
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:30,628
How is Do Jun at fault?

1196
01:20:30,629 --> 01:20:31,798
Father.

1197
01:20:31,799 --> 01:20:33,029
I must hold a board meeting.

1198
01:20:33,030 --> 01:20:35,999
Today's agenda is the
dismissal of CEO Jin Hwa Young.

1199
01:20:36,600 --> 01:20:38,229
The prosecutor in charge of
Aunt Hwa Young's case is...

1200
01:20:38,230 --> 01:20:40,400
Do Jun's friend from college.

1201
01:21:07,700 --> 01:21:10,600
