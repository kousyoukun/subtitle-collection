he's run off to find
himself, hasn't come back.

Steven, we're coming to

I'm interested in you leaving.

So, what's it gonna take?

00:00:14,385 --> 00:00:17,680
Mack, there's a certain
gentleman staying with me.

I want you to remind him,
no one crosses Blake Carrington.

Where am I?

You're in the hospital.

00:01:12,026 --> 00:01:13,026
You had a fall.

22
00:01:15,154 --> 00:01:16,488
Is the baby okay?

23
00:01:18,532 --> 00:01:20,940
The trauma caused the
placenta to detach,

24
00:01:20,941 --> 00:01:23,412
something called a placental abruption.

25

Honey, he didn't make it.

Who would've done this?

they hurt Mark before.

What if they knew he was in
Atlanta and finished the job?

- This is Fallon.

This is Arthur Breland. I'm calling

46
00:02:33,243 --> 00:02:35,359
from the American
embassy in Paris, France.

47
00:02:35,442 --> 00:02:37,778
A man identifying himself
as Steven Carrington

48
00:02:37,861 --> 00:02:39,363
is requesting a replacement passport.

49
00:02:39,446 --> 00:02:42,366
Okay. How do I know this
isn't a scam or a kidnapper?

00:02:42,449 --> 00:02:44,177
- Miss, this is the American embassy.
<i>- Okay.</i>

can I please speak to him?

Steven, what the hell is going on?

Is this guy holding you
hostage or something?

56
00:02:59,425 --> 00:03:01,677
Because if he is,
remember the code word.

00:03:02,094 --> 00:03:03,095
- Cheerio.
<i>- Fallon... </i>

58
00:03:03,178 --> 00:03:05,806
Oh, wait, could he hear me? Okay.
We need to change the code word.

00:03:05,889 --> 00:03:06,890
Fallon, I'm okay.

60
00:03:07,016 --> 00:03:09,893
But somebody stole my jacket
and I lost everything.

61
00:03:09,977 --> 00:03:12,497
- Were you sober when that happened?
- What do you mean was I sober?

62
00:03:12,521 --> 00:03:14,648
I... Look, I'll fill you in later,

63
00:03:14,732 --> 00:03:16,734
but right now,
I need you to talk to this guy

64
00:03:16,817 --> 00:03:19,778
so that he can get the passport
paperwork started. Please.

65
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:22,197
- Give the phone back to Frenchy.

Thank you. Sorry.

- Don't worry about knocking.
- Really?

68
00:03:53,896 --> 00:03:56,547
You spent half the summer
sprawled across a lawn chair

in nothing but a Speedo.

That's when I had my summer body.

Okay. You're gonna wanna pack a coat.

72
00:04:01,403 --> 00:04:03,280
- We are going to Paris.
- Now?

73
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:07,117
Well, I don't think it's a great
time with Cristal, Mark, Steven.

74
00:04:07,201 --> 00:04:08,786
Steven is in Paris.

00:04:09,411 --> 00:04:10,411
What?

76
00:04:11,538 --> 00:04:13,099
- How do you know?
- I got a call from him.

77
00:04:13,123 --> 00:04:15,667
- He called you?
- No. The American embassy did.

78
00:04:15,751 --> 00:04:18,379
He lost his passport,
he lost his wallet, he lost everything.

79
00:04:18,462 --> 00:04:20,839
- So, they're getting him a new one.
- Is he okay?

80
00:04:20,923 --> 00:04:23,217
He said he was,
but you don't disappear for two weeks

81
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:26,053
and then turn up with no passport
and no wallet if everything's fine.

82
00:04:26,845 --> 00:04:28,470
I don't know. I think
there was something

83
00:04:28,471 --> 00:04:30,850
he didn't wanna tell me or he couldn't.

84
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:32,726
Like a "cheerio" situation?

85
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:35,396
He told you the code? That was our code.

86
00:04:36,355 --> 00:04:38,148
Anyway, I asked him if he was sober

87
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,908
and he did that thing
where he gets all defensive

88
00:04:40,909 --> 00:04:42,444
without answering the question.

89
00:04:42,528 --> 00:04:44,822
- "What do you mean, was I sober?"
- Yeah, yeah. Exactly.

90
00:04:44,905 --> 00:04:47,675
But Sam, you haven't known Steven

91
00:04:47,676 --> 00:04:49,716
when he's been on one of
his benders, not a bad one.

And I don't know what we're gonna find.

93
00:04:52,204 --> 00:04:55,082
So, if it's too much, I will go alone.

94
00:04:55,165 --> 00:04:58,627
What? No, of course I'm going,
he's my husband, I'm worried.

00:04:59,795 --> 00:05:02,089

- You haven't?

00:05:02,965 --> 00:05:06,552
I wish we were going under better
circumstances, but it is just divine.

97
00:05:06,635 --> 00:05:10,639
I'll take us to all the best spots.
Assuming Steven's okay, of course.

98
00:05:10,722 --> 00:05:11,722
Of course.

My guys said you were
looking for me this morning?

Actually, I was looking
for you yesterday, too,

00:06:20,065 --> 00:06:22,421
at around 4:30. Where were you?

I was out back wrapping
the rose bushes all day.

Well, maybe one of your guys saw me
dragging my own trash to the bins.

- I'll talk to the crew.
- Good.

that the groundskeeper was
smoking behind the begonias again.

That was one time.

for me this morning, too.

Well, then, what's going on, Alexis?

Because I don't really think you
were hauling trash yesterday.

Fine. You're right. I was here.

Cristal's coming back from
the hospital this morning.

She lost the baby.

Oh, my God.

Yeah. Mark didn't make it either.

I... I'm so sorry.

147

We've got police coming through.

We've got an investigation to deal with.

- Do they know what happened?
- Well, it's too soon to say.

150

Would you do me a favor? While I'm
tied up would you go see Cristal?

151
00:08:00,644 --> 00:08:01,764
You want me to sit with her?

I know you've had your differences,
we've had ours, too.

But at the end of the day,
you're a mother who's lost her child.

You understand more
what she's going through

00:08:24,946 --> 00:08:26,754
You shouldn't have to
carry your own bags.

160
00:08:26,837 --> 00:08:29,590
- Well, you could've offered to help.
- That's true.

161
00:08:32,968 --> 00:08:34,261
Oh, my God, the view.

162
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,096
I mean, wow.

163
00:08:41,268 --> 00:08:42,519
[Steven] Oh, my God.

164
00:08:43,854 --> 00:08:44,854
Sam.

165
00:08:49,061 --> 00:08:50,205
Fallon!

166
00:08:53,363 --> 00:08:54,363
What are you doing here?

167
00:08:54,406 --> 00:08:55,532
[in French] Pardon me?

168
00:08:55,616 --> 00:08:57,409
[in English] Shouldn't
we be asking you that?

169
00:08:58,702 --> 00:08:59,942
There's so much to catch up on.

170
00:09:01,205 --> 00:09:02,623
I'm really glad you're here.

171
00:09:02,706 --> 00:09:04,583
Well, I'm glad you're doing okay.

172
00:09:05,459 --> 00:09:06,627
Maybe "glad" is strong.

173
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:08,430
Why didn't you guys
tell me you were coming?

174
00:09:09,088 --> 00:09:11,256
We wanted to surprise you.

175
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:13,467
You must be ready for a
drink after that flight.

176
00:09:13,717 --> 00:09:17,304
- Hey, Steven, are you okay?
- Of course.

177
00:09:17,387 --> 00:09:20,182
Well, your hair suggests otherwise.
I'll text Francois.

178
00:09:20,682 --> 00:09:22,351
We were really worried about you.

179
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,270
I get how it looks.

180
00:09:25,354 --> 00:09:28,482
And I'm really sorry,
haven't handled this well.

181
00:09:29,024 --> 00:09:32,236
- Understatement of the century.
- Steven, what happened in Paraguay?

182
00:09:32,861 --> 00:09:35,322
I had a bad trip, rougher than I let on.

183
00:09:35,823 --> 00:09:38,534
I just came here to get away,
and I'm already feeling much better.

184
00:09:38,617 --> 00:09:39,827
You've said that before.

185
00:09:39,993 --> 00:09:41,120
I really am this time.

186
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:43,038
I mean, now, I am.

187
00:09:43,831 --> 00:09:45,207
Thanks to my friend George.

188
00:09:47,209 --> 00:09:48,209
George?

189
00:09:48,502 --> 00:09:51,130
- And who is George exactly?
- Sam, it's not like that.

190
00:09:52,714 --> 00:09:55,759
I met him in Paraguay before
the ayahuasca ceremony.

191
00:09:56,802 --> 00:09:58,530
He pulled me out when I came unstuck,

192
00:09:58,531 --> 00:10:00,848
especially when I was
spiraling about Dad.

193
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:03,164
It's just nice to
have someone to talk to

194
00:10:03,165 --> 00:10:05,018
who didn't know me from before.

195
00:10:06,228 --> 00:10:07,771
- No Carrington baggage.
- Right.

196
00:10:09,148 --> 00:10:10,148
Baggage.

197
00:10:12,651 --> 00:10:14,278
When I told him we had a flat in Paris,

198
00:10:14,361 --> 00:10:16,881
he suggested we come here for a
change of scenery, and before...

199
00:10:16,947 --> 00:10:18,782
- He suggested?
- What? He's staying here?

200
00:10:19,992 --> 00:10:21,451
Are these his?

201
00:10:21,535 --> 00:10:23,120
Yes, Sam. He wears pants.

202
00:10:23,203 --> 00:10:28,500
Oh. So, this George guy hears
that you have a flat in Paris,

203
00:10:28,584 --> 00:10:30,961
and suddenly,
he weasels his way into it.

204
00:10:31,086 --> 00:10:32,766
Things are starting to
make more sense now.

205
00:10:33,213 --> 00:10:35,733
You see, Steven has always been
an easy target for gold diggers.

206
00:10:37,676 --> 00:10:38,676
No offense.

207
00:10:39,303 --> 00:10:40,637
This isn't that, Fallon.

208
00:10:40,721 --> 00:10:44,183
Let me guess, he's a poor Paraguayan
boy who'd never seen Paris?

209
00:10:44,266 --> 00:10:46,768
He's British. And it's
completely platonic.

210
00:10:47,394 --> 00:10:49,789
I know it's our family's tendency
to see the worst in people,

211
00:10:49,813 --> 00:10:52,191
but George looked out
for me when I couldn't.

212
00:10:52,608 --> 00:10:55,319
- I wanna meet him.
- Of course. You will.

213
00:10:56,069 --> 00:10:58,709
But right now, I need to go to the
embassy to finalize some papers.

214
00:10:59,323 --> 00:11:01,654
I'd say come with, but
it always takes a bit

215
00:11:01,655 --> 00:11:02,760
and I can't bring anyone in with me.

216
00:11:02,784 --> 00:11:05,162
So, why don't we all
meet for dinner later?

217
00:11:05,287 --> 00:11:08,136
Fine. But somewhere iconic, please.

218
00:11:08,137 --> 00:11:09,875
I mean, we shouldn't waste a good meal.

219
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:11,168
I suppose I could eat.

220
00:11:11,251 --> 00:11:12,961
How about Café Marly, 8:00?

221
00:11:13,837 --> 00:11:15,964
I'll call George. You're gonna love him.

222
00:11:17,341 --> 00:11:18,800
I really am glad you're here.

223
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,640
[sighs]

224
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,854
[Sam] I always thought I'd walk
along the banks of the Seine

225
00:11:33,878 --> 00:11:35,462
for the first time with Steven,

226
00:11:35,963 --> 00:11:36,963
not his sister.

227
00:11:37,923 --> 00:11:39,258
Not that this isn't great.

228
00:11:39,341 --> 00:11:41,510
No. No. It's my dream come true.

229
00:11:42,595 --> 00:11:43,679
I feel for you, Sam.

230
00:11:43,762 --> 00:11:45,991
I mean, you met my brother
when he was at his most stable

231
00:11:46,015 --> 00:11:49,643
and then he had his whole identity
crisis, wanting to go find himself,

232
00:11:49,727 --> 00:11:53,564
and now, well, you're seeing
the full-tilt Carrington spiral.

233
00:11:54,106 --> 00:11:56,442
I'm trying to give him
the benefit of the doubt

234
00:11:56,859 --> 00:11:59,612
and not be the jealous husband.

235
00:12:00,946 --> 00:12:04,074
But why didn't he mention
this George guy before now?

236
00:12:04,158 --> 00:12:05,284
Because I am right.

237
00:12:06,076 --> 00:12:09,079
I mean, look, Steven probably
realizes he's being grifted.

238
00:12:09,163 --> 00:12:11,790
But right now, it's easier for him
to be around someone who's fake

239
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:13,209
than someone who's real.

240
00:12:13,584 --> 00:12:15,871
George gets his free Parisian vacation,

241
00:12:15,872 --> 00:12:17,671
and my brother gets
a vacay from reality.

242
00:12:17,755 --> 00:12:22,051
Right. So, same reason why you were
so game to fly across the Atlantic

243
00:12:22,134 --> 00:12:25,930
and get away from Culhane
after you slept with him again?

244
00:12:26,138 --> 00:12:30,559
Ah! Look. A street artist
in Paris, how novel.

245
00:12:33,395 --> 00:12:34,395
[Alexis] Cristal?

246
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:38,776
Blake asked me if I would come up.

247
00:12:40,486 --> 00:12:43,405
I'm probably the last
person you wanna see,

248
00:12:43,656 --> 00:12:45,824
and I'd understand if you
didn't wanna see anyone.

249
00:12:47,993 --> 00:12:49,370
Could you give us a moment?

250
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:58,504
After Adam, I went to bed
and wouldn't leave.

251
00:12:58,921 --> 00:13:03,050
I closed the blinds, turned off all
the lights, and locked the door.

252
00:13:09,556 --> 00:13:10,556
When did it stop?

253
00:13:11,267 --> 00:13:12,267
The pain?

254
00:13:14,436 --> 00:13:15,436
It didn't.

255
00:13:17,481 --> 00:13:21,902
Just moved behind other things
instead of in front of them.

256
00:13:23,737 --> 00:13:25,990
- Steven, Fallon.
- [exhales]

257
00:13:27,866 --> 00:13:30,369
They said I might not be
able to have children.

258
00:13:32,371 --> 00:13:37,501
And Mark... will never get
to do anything because of me.

259
00:13:39,253 --> 00:13:40,713
Cristal, it's not your fault.

260
00:13:41,505 --> 00:13:43,381
The guilt I felt after Adam,

261
00:13:43,382 --> 00:13:45,926
all the guilt in the world,
it didn't bring him back.

262
00:13:47,177 --> 00:13:50,213
I just hope that you
don't spend 30 years

263
00:13:50,214 --> 00:13:53,392
trying to find some sort of closure.

264
00:13:54,351 --> 00:13:55,351
I won't.

265
00:13:57,646 --> 00:14:00,024
Once the investigation
confirms who did this.

266
00:14:00,774 --> 00:14:01,774
Confirms?

267
00:14:02,943 --> 00:14:05,029
Do they have a lead?

268
00:14:05,112 --> 00:14:06,112
They will find out.

269
00:14:07,614 --> 00:14:08,614
Blake promised.

270
00:14:09,283 --> 00:14:12,500
- Hm.
- And if you can't trust family,

271
00:14:12,501 --> 00:14:14,430
who can you trust?

272
00:14:19,001 --> 00:14:21,837
- Mack?
- Miss Carrington. It's been a while.

273
00:14:23,422 --> 00:14:25,507
Excuse me,
Mr. Carrington is expecting you.

274
00:14:25,633 --> 00:14:27,092
[Anders] Please excuse us.

275
00:14:35,893 --> 00:14:38,979
- [Blake] Get you a drink, Mack?
- No, I never drink on the job.

276
00:14:40,314 --> 00:14:42,399
And Anders said you had
a new one for me.

277
00:14:45,235 --> 00:14:46,235
Yeah. Actually...

278
00:14:48,906 --> 00:14:50,532
I wanna talk about the last one.

279
00:14:53,035 --> 00:14:54,370
What happened yesterday?

280
00:14:55,371 --> 00:14:56,371
Yesterday?

281
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:57,830
Mark Jennings.

282
00:14:58,457 --> 00:14:59,457
Nothing happened.

283
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,418
Well, then, let's talk
about what didn't happen,

284
00:15:01,502 --> 00:15:04,171
because they drove Mark's body
off my property yesterday.

285
00:15:04,254 --> 00:15:07,424
My wife was almost killed,
and my child is gone.

286
00:15:08,133 --> 00:15:09,693
I don't know what you're talking about.

287
00:15:12,388 --> 00:15:13,472
I told you to rough him up.

288
00:15:13,972 --> 00:15:16,475
Then you told me
to stand down. So I did.

289
00:15:16,725 --> 00:15:18,690
You didn't get the message.
You came here to do the job

290
00:15:18,691 --> 00:15:19,805
and you screwed it up.

291
00:15:22,106 --> 00:15:23,626
Remember who you're talking to, Blake.

292
00:15:24,983 --> 00:15:26,276
You're the one who called me.

293
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:29,113
You went too far, and now
you're lying to cover your tracks.

294
00:15:29,196 --> 00:15:32,700
You be careful, and remember
who you're talking to.

295
00:15:33,575 --> 00:15:34,702
[chattering]

296
00:15:36,328 --> 00:15:37,746
[Sam] It's nice of you to join us.

297
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:40,165
So sorry. The embassy
always takes forever.

298
00:15:43,627 --> 00:15:45,227
Thought George would've
been here by now.

299
00:15:45,504 --> 00:15:47,904
- You didn't bring him?
- No. He said was gonna meet us here.

300
00:15:48,716 --> 00:15:50,210
Well, it sounds like Boy George

301
00:15:50,211 --> 00:15:52,052
doesn't wanna show his
face to your family.

302
00:15:52,219 --> 00:15:53,512
Nothing suspicious about that.

303
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:57,160
I chose this spot because he went
to the Louvre this afternoon.

304
00:15:57,975 --> 00:16:00,728
- Maybe he got lost.
- I sent him with a private docent.

305
00:16:00,811 --> 00:16:02,479
Did you also buy him the <i>Mona Lisa?</i>

306
00:16:03,939 --> 00:16:05,649
Still pushing your grifter theory?

307
00:16:05,733 --> 00:16:08,044
The only thing you're proving
right now is that I was right

308
00:16:08,068 --> 00:16:11,363
to have run away from our wildly
paranoid, judgmental family.

309
00:16:11,447 --> 00:16:12,447
Paranoid?

310
00:16:12,906 --> 00:16:14,408
Okay. I'll play.

311
00:16:15,367 --> 00:16:17,554
- What do we know about George?
- What do you mean "what do we know"?

312
00:16:17,578 --> 00:16:19,747
- I mean, what's his last name?
- Emerson.

313
00:16:19,997 --> 00:16:22,374
- Dubious name.
- And where is he from? What does he do?

314
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:25,836
London. He's a philanthropist. God,
Fallon, would you just back off?

315
00:16:25,961 --> 00:16:27,212
Steven, take it easy.

316
00:16:27,296 --> 00:16:30,299
I'm fine. I just keep
getting the third degree.

317
00:16:30,382 --> 00:16:32,676
I'm sorry. I only care
because I love you.

318
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,500
If this George is such a good influence,

319
00:16:34,501 --> 00:16:35,905
why are you a glass ahead of us already?

320
00:16:35,929 --> 00:16:37,353
Doesn't he know that you went to rehab?

321
00:16:37,354 --> 00:16:39,391
I hate to admit it, but she has a point.

322
00:16:39,475 --> 00:16:40,934
George has only looked after me.

323
00:16:41,018 --> 00:16:42,498
And what better way to look after you

324
00:16:42,561 --> 00:16:43,976
than to keep you
liquored up and isolated

325
00:16:43,977 --> 00:16:45,841
from the people who
truly care about you?

326
00:16:46,064 --> 00:16:48,097
You're gonna realize how
stupid this all sounds

327
00:16:48,098 --> 00:16:50,236
when you actually meet him.
In fact, I'm gonna go find him

328
00:16:50,237 --> 00:16:51,991
so we can clear this
up once and for all.

329
00:16:52,112 --> 00:16:53,572
Thanks for a gorgeous dinner.

330
00:16:54,531 --> 00:16:55,531
[Sam] Really?

331
00:16:57,117 --> 00:16:59,953
At least we know something
now about this George Emerson,

332
00:17:00,037 --> 00:17:01,117
philanthropist from London.

333
00:17:01,955 --> 00:17:03,250
Okay. Fine. That's all we know,

334
00:17:03,251 --> 00:17:06,043
but I have a cousin who
can help us find out more.

335
00:17:09,421 --> 00:17:11,840
[Blake] No. You killed him
and now you're lying about it!

336
00:17:11,924 --> 00:17:13,592
[Mack] I didn't kill anyone, Blake!

337
00:17:13,675 --> 00:17:15,904
- I told you I wasn't anywhere near here.
- Then who was?

338
00:17:15,928 --> 00:17:17,221
[knock on door]

339
00:17:21,683 --> 00:17:23,352
Alexis. [clears throat]

340
00:17:25,145 --> 00:17:27,731
- What's going on?
- Well, I was just up with Cristal.

341
00:17:28,148 --> 00:17:31,485
- Yeah. Is she all right?
- Under the circumstances, I suppose.

342
00:17:31,568 --> 00:17:33,403
Thank you for trying, at least.

343
00:17:33,779 --> 00:17:35,940
- I'm about to finish up this meeting, so...
- I'm sorry.

344
00:17:35,941 --> 00:17:37,091
I didn't mean to interrupt.

345
00:17:37,115 --> 00:17:38,992
- Thank you.
- But as I was coming down,

346
00:17:39,076 --> 00:17:41,390
I happened to notice the guy
that was coming in to see you?

347
00:17:41,391 --> 00:17:43,263
- That's Mack, right?
- Yes.

348
00:17:43,264 --> 00:17:45,804
He used to work here. Is he coming back?

349
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,627
Well, it's just that I saw
him around yesterday, too.

350
00:17:49,628 --> 00:17:50,628
Where?

351
00:17:50,921 --> 00:17:56,260
- When?
- Um... At the stables around 3:30 or 4.

352
00:17:57,719 --> 00:17:58,719
Excuse me, please.

353
00:18:08,108 --> 00:18:10,402
[Juliette] Ah, Steven, the smile that...

354
00:18:10,486 --> 00:18:12,375
[Fallon]... emptied a
thousand bottles of champagne

355
00:18:12,376 --> 00:18:14,573
at the Moulin Rouge.

356
00:18:14,698 --> 00:18:16,366
Or so Parisian legend has it.

357
00:18:17,326 --> 00:18:18,804
[Juliette] Tell him I'm disappointed.

358
00:18:18,828 --> 00:18:20,235
He's been here for
how many weeks in Paris

359
00:18:20,236 --> 00:18:22,539
and doesn't call his favorite cousin?

360
00:18:22,623 --> 00:18:25,083
Well, he didn't even call us,
but you know Steven.

361
00:18:25,209 --> 00:18:26,710
[in French] He is a loner, but still.

362
00:18:27,419 --> 00:18:29,499
- What did she say?
- Steven has always been a loner.

363
00:18:30,214 --> 00:18:32,799
His alleged friend didn't
even show up last night,

364
00:18:32,883 --> 00:18:35,603
when we went to leave this morning,
Steven was still waiting for him,

365
00:18:35,636 --> 00:18:39,014
so, maybe us showing up was
enough to scare him off.

366
00:18:39,139 --> 00:18:41,632
I'll have Papa's security team
look into this George person.

367
00:18:41,633 --> 00:18:43,685
- Don't worry.
- How is Uncle Benjamin?

368
00:18:43,828 --> 00:18:45,395
In London, <i>Dieu merci</i>.

369
00:18:46,063 --> 00:18:49,066
Which means I'm having a little
party tonight at the chateau.

370
00:18:49,566 --> 00:18:50,567
You must come.

371
00:18:50,651 --> 00:18:52,027
_

372
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:53,987
- _
- [in French] Sure.

373
00:18:54,863 --> 00:18:55,863
_

374
00:18:58,992 --> 00:19:00,592
She's the Frenchest
person I've ever met.

375
00:19:00,661 --> 00:19:03,997
Well, when her dad was
disinherited by my grandfather,

376
00:19:04,122 --> 00:19:07,459
he married a French billionaire.
Crazy money, questionable sources.

377
00:19:07,543 --> 00:19:10,796
So, if anyone can find dirt on George,
it's them.

378
00:19:10,879 --> 00:19:13,549
- Plus they can make him disappear.
- You mean kill him?

379
00:19:13,632 --> 00:19:16,093
I'm sure it won't come to that.
Unless it does.

380
00:19:16,176 --> 00:19:17,636
Fallon, what if you're wrong?

381
00:19:18,011 --> 00:19:20,597
Maybe George isn't a grifter.
We don't know.

382
00:19:20,681 --> 00:19:22,975
Sam, you have known Steven
for, what, a year?

383
00:19:23,058 --> 00:19:26,019
I have known him for 26.
Trust me, this is his pattern.

384
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,941
I'm gonna head back to the flat.
I'm jet-lagged.

385
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:36,297
[Fallon on recording] <i>Leave me
a message and I'll consider it.</i>

386
00:19:36,321 --> 00:19:38,991
Hey, hate to interrupt
your time in Paraguay,

387
00:19:39,074 --> 00:19:40,784
but I need to talk to you, Fallon.

388
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:42,995
Call me when you can.

389
00:19:45,205 --> 00:19:47,124
If you're looking for Fallon,
she isn't here.

390
00:19:47,207 --> 00:19:48,207
I'm not.

391
00:19:48,584 --> 00:19:49,918
You, uh, okay?

392
00:19:50,002 --> 00:19:52,254
Cristal's favorite. Mint chip.

393
00:19:53,755 --> 00:19:55,149
I didn't know what else to do for her.

394
00:19:55,173 --> 00:19:58,468
With Sam and Fallon gone,
I'm going a little stir crazy.

395
00:19:59,553 --> 00:20:01,536
You wanna help run a community rehab

396
00:20:01,537 --> 00:20:03,600
and diversion initiative
for the Atlantix?

397
00:20:03,602 --> 00:20:05,470
Oh, no. I think "just sitting there"

398
00:20:05,471 --> 00:20:06,871
is probably closer to my skill set.

399
00:20:06,935 --> 00:20:08,687
You're about as qualified as I am.

400
00:20:09,771 --> 00:20:11,687
I handled everything I
could, but I could use Blake

401
00:20:11,688 --> 00:20:12,917
to look over a couple things.

402
00:20:12,941 --> 00:20:14,526
- You got this.
- Do I?

403
00:20:14,901 --> 00:20:18,405
I've never really talked to anyone
about my own issues with substances,

404
00:20:18,488 --> 00:20:20,490
much less a room full of strangers.

405
00:20:20,574 --> 00:20:23,493
Sounds to me like you're exactly
the right man for the job.

406
00:20:24,411 --> 00:20:25,579
How do you figure?

407
00:20:25,746 --> 00:20:29,041
Well, this program is
for the community, right?

408
00:20:29,666 --> 00:20:31,335
The community you grew up in.

409
00:20:32,002 --> 00:20:34,588
Blake hasn't lived it. You have.

410
00:20:36,089 --> 00:20:38,717
As long as you remember that,
you'll know what to do.

411
00:20:41,928 --> 00:20:45,599
You know, they have people who
will literally buy that for you.

412
00:20:46,266 --> 00:20:48,393
I know. I like to do things for myself.

413
00:20:48,977 --> 00:20:50,145
And for other people.

414
00:20:52,522 --> 00:20:53,522
It's refreshing.

415
00:21:05,035 --> 00:21:08,455
- George, where have you been?
- What do you mean?

416
00:21:08,538 --> 00:21:11,833
You never showed up to dinner.
And then you were out all night.

417
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,461
I never showed up?
I waited at Café Julien for an hour.

418
00:21:14,544 --> 00:21:17,130
- I told you we were at Marly.
- No, you said Julien.

419
00:21:17,255 --> 00:21:20,258
And I had plans late last night,
friends in town.

420
00:21:20,342 --> 00:21:23,136
We had a whole conversation about it.
Do you not remember any of this?

421
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:24,220
No. We...

422
00:21:24,846 --> 00:21:28,141
Well, why didn't you answer
when I called? Like, seven times?

423
00:21:28,225 --> 00:21:29,726
Honestly? I was over it.

424
00:21:30,477 --> 00:21:32,441
I assumed you'd gotten drunk or high,

425
00:21:32,442 --> 00:21:34,314
bailed on dinner and forgot to tell me,

426
00:21:34,398 --> 00:21:35,860
or maybe you changed your mind

427
00:21:35,861 --> 00:21:38,070
about introducing me to
your family considering...

428
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,736
[doorbell buzzes]

429
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,320
Who's that?

430
00:21:44,533 --> 00:21:46,368
- [beeps]
- <i>Hey, it's Sam.</i>

431
00:21:46,451 --> 00:21:47,451
Hey. Come on up.

432
00:21:48,078 --> 00:21:49,678
Of course, I want you to meet my family.

433
00:21:49,746 --> 00:21:52,374
Well, are you sure you want them
to see you right now? Like this?

434
00:21:52,708 --> 00:21:55,019
What? I didn't go to rehab
for a joint and a glass of wine.

435
00:21:55,043 --> 00:21:57,523
You said yourself, Steven,
you've got an addictive personality.

436
00:21:57,587 --> 00:21:58,922
Seriously? You, too?

437
00:21:59,381 --> 00:22:01,181
Three days ago,
it was you calling the dealer.

438
00:22:01,675 --> 00:22:03,075
Guess as long as I'm paying, right?

439
00:22:03,135 --> 00:22:05,679
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where did that come from?

440
00:22:05,762 --> 00:22:06,762
[buzzing]

441
00:22:08,265 --> 00:22:09,599
[Steven] Hey there. Are you okay?

442
00:22:10,308 --> 00:22:12,144
Are you? Who are you yelling at?

443
00:22:13,145 --> 00:22:15,397
No one. I mean, George. We just...

444
00:22:15,856 --> 00:22:18,296
It's not important. I'm just glad
you finally get to meet him.

445
00:22:18,734 --> 00:22:20,652
- Yeah. Me too.
- George?

446
00:22:21,278 --> 00:22:22,278
Does he smoke pot?

447
00:22:26,041 --> 00:22:27,075
Where'd he go?

448
00:22:27,159 --> 00:22:30,328
Please tell me this isn't
another Ted Dinard situation.

449
00:22:30,412 --> 00:22:31,412
No.

450
00:22:31,663 --> 00:22:33,623
I... I don't know where he went.

451
00:22:35,041 --> 00:22:38,420
- Did the embassy find your passport?
- No. They're mailing a new one.

452
00:22:40,672 --> 00:22:43,508
I have no idea how,
but he must have slipped out somehow.

453
00:22:44,843 --> 00:22:46,052
Where did you find this?

454
00:22:46,136 --> 00:22:49,055
You were mugged, right?

455
00:22:49,973 --> 00:22:52,658
You didn't pretend to lose your passport

456
00:22:52,659 --> 00:22:54,227
so you wouldn't have to come home?

457
00:22:54,978 --> 00:22:56,605
What? No.

458
00:22:57,689 --> 00:22:59,232
Steven, what's going on?

459
00:22:59,983 --> 00:23:02,861
Nothing. Of course I wanna
come home to you, Sam.

460
00:23:02,944 --> 00:23:07,157
I was coming home, but then
I got mugged and things just...

461
00:23:07,991 --> 00:23:09,451
You can ask George. I mean...

462
00:23:12,162 --> 00:23:13,162
We, um...

463
00:23:14,372 --> 00:23:16,082
We saw your cousin, Juliette.

464
00:23:17,542 --> 00:23:19,628
She was surprised
you were here in Paris.

465
00:23:22,088 --> 00:23:26,134
Anyway, she's having a party tonight.
Maybe we can all go together.

466
00:23:26,676 --> 00:23:28,428
That actually sounds really lovely.

467
00:23:31,097 --> 00:23:32,182

00:32:42,566 --> 00:32:43,566
Hey.

627
00:32:44,818 --> 00:32:47,070
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry for everything. I...

628
00:32:48,447 --> 00:32:50,365
- I need help.
- Okay.

629
00:32:50,741 --> 00:32:52,951
- I think I wanna talk to someone.
- It's okay.

630
00:32:53,076 --> 00:32:54,870
Okay? We're gonna get you help.

631
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:57,789
Everything's gonna be okay. Okay?

632
00:32:58,373 --> 00:32:59,666
[sobbing]

633
00:33:20,354 --> 00:33:21,772
Everything is gonna be okay.

634
00:33:28,968 --> 00:33:31,387
[Fallon] Yeah. Yeah.
The doctor is gonna see him.

635
00:33:33,181 --> 00:33:36,976
Okay. Thanks so much
for everything. Really.

636
00:33:47,487 --> 00:33:48,530
That was Juliette.

637
00:33:49,301 --> 00:33:51,271
I told her you're
insisting on no visitors

638
00:33:51,272 --> 00:33:52,792
but she's just as stubborn as you are.

639
00:33:55,223 --> 00:33:58,143
I still think we could find a
comparable clinic in Atlanta.

640
00:33:58,393 --> 00:34:00,437
I can't go back.

641
00:34:01,354 --> 00:34:02,522
I mean, yes, sure.

642
00:34:02,606 --> 00:34:05,775
I need time to dry out,
but more than that...

643
00:34:07,694 --> 00:34:09,904
going home, I...

644
00:34:10,363 --> 00:34:12,115
I just can't deal with that.

645
00:34:13,033 --> 00:34:14,993
With reality.

646
00:34:15,869 --> 00:34:16,869
Clearly.

647
00:34:20,498 --> 00:34:22,917
- What do I tell Dad?
- Please don't.

648
00:34:26,254 --> 00:34:29,966
We need to administer an IV.
It's normal procedure for hydration.

649
00:34:31,509 --> 00:34:33,136
It's important to stay hydrated.

650
00:34:35,472 --> 00:34:37,182
Okay. I'll give you guys a minute.

651
00:34:43,855 --> 00:34:44,855
I love you, Steven.

652
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,441
I love you too, Fal.

653
00:34:58,328 --> 00:35:00,705
- [in French] One moment, please.
- Of course.

654
00:35:07,462 --> 00:35:08,462
I feel sick.

655
00:35:10,674 --> 00:35:13,385
Everything I said at the party,
I just wanna take it back.

656
00:35:14,010 --> 00:35:15,010
I don't.

657
00:35:16,388 --> 00:35:17,472
It needed to be said.

658
00:35:19,516 --> 00:35:21,267
But you were wrong about one thing.

659
00:35:23,311 --> 00:35:24,729
You are enough.

660
00:35:26,064 --> 00:35:30,151
You're more than enough for the
person who actually deserves you.

661
00:35:32,821 --> 00:35:33,821
But that's not me.

662
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,280
What?

663
00:35:35,907 --> 00:35:36,908
Of course it is.

664
00:35:37,033 --> 00:35:40,120
How could it be when I
don't even know who I am?

665
00:35:41,830 --> 00:35:43,790
I mean, the person I was when we met...

666
00:35:45,417 --> 00:35:46,584
he doesn't exist.

667
00:35:50,046 --> 00:35:51,798
No more than George, I guess.

668
00:35:52,549 --> 00:35:53,549
Steven...

669
00:35:53,883 --> 00:36:00,515
My whole life has been nothing
but pressure and expectations.

670
00:36:01,516 --> 00:36:03,727
That's what I was running away from.

671
00:36:04,853 --> 00:36:05,854
I needed a way out.

672
00:36:07,605 --> 00:36:10,942
The best thing you can do for me
right now is to give me one.

673
00:36:14,487 --> 00:36:15,487
Please.

674
00:36:21,161 --> 00:36:22,829
[Alexis] Cristal, how are you feeling?

675
00:36:23,830 --> 00:36:25,039
Better. Thank you.

676
00:36:27,292 --> 00:36:29,919
And thank you for yesterday.
It meant a lot to me.

677
00:36:31,379 --> 00:36:32,379
To both of us.

678
00:36:37,761 --> 00:36:40,346
Juliette said something
I can't stop thinking about.

679
00:36:41,723 --> 00:36:43,850
"In life and love,
there's no going back."

680
00:36:44,559 --> 00:36:48,480
- What did she mean by that?
- Well, she's French so, everything.

681
00:36:50,315 --> 00:36:52,817
- It was about me and Culhane, but...
- I get it.

682
00:36:56,446 --> 00:36:57,489
I love Steven...

683
00:36:59,282 --> 00:37:04,704
but, uh... I have to move on
even if it hurts like hell.

684
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:10,251
- Does that make me a terrible person?
- Of course not.

685
00:37:11,503 --> 00:37:13,838
As long as moving on
doesn't mean moving out.

686
00:37:15,548 --> 00:37:18,426
Please stay at the manor.
I can't lose another brother.

687
00:37:19,886 --> 00:37:20,886
Not right now.

688
00:37:23,223 --> 00:37:24,343
[Culhane] <i>Thanks for coming.</i>

689
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:25,724
I guess you were expecting to see

690
00:37:25,725 --> 00:37:27,477
Mr. Carrington up here instead of me...

691
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:28,853
[knocking]

692
00:37:31,105 --> 00:37:33,149
Fallon. What are you doing here?

693
00:37:33,691 --> 00:37:35,276
I was on my way to your office.

694
00:37:36,069 --> 00:37:37,737
I'm sorry I missed your call yesterday.

695
00:37:37,821 --> 00:37:39,544
You didn't have to come
here to tell me that.

696
00:37:39,545 --> 00:37:41,783
You could've just called me back.

697
00:37:41,866 --> 00:37:46,955
I know. I'm sorry. I was out of
town dealing with some stuff.

698
00:37:47,831 --> 00:37:50,208
Anyway, in the middle of all of that,

699
00:37:50,291 --> 00:37:56,130
my mind kept coming back to you,
and us, and the other night.

700
00:37:57,131 --> 00:38:00,176
And, um...
I don't wanna string you along.

701
00:38:01,135 --> 00:38:02,303
I don't wanna hurt you.

702
00:38:03,054 --> 00:38:07,433
So, I have to tell you that
I need to move on, Culhane.

703
00:38:09,602 --> 00:38:10,603
I thought we did.

704
00:38:12,981 --> 00:38:16,734
Oh, I called you for some work advice.
But I figured it out.

705
00:38:17,694 --> 00:38:21,197
Oh, okay. Well... great.

706
00:38:21,781 --> 00:38:23,449
Sorry. I got this meeting.

707
00:38:23,783 --> 00:38:25,910
- Yeah. Okay.
- [phone buzzing]

708
00:38:27,161 --> 00:38:28,705
Hey, Kirby.

709
00:38:33,209 --> 00:38:34,919
[George] Hate to see you like this,
Steven.

710
00:38:38,673 --> 00:38:40,216
He's not real. He's not real.

711
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:41,885
You're right. I'm not real.

712
00:38:43,344 --> 00:38:45,305
Well, I'm not really George, anyway.

713
00:38:46,806 --> 00:38:48,622
Didn't take too much digging
to find that interview

714
00:38:48,623 --> 00:38:51,436
where you cited <i>Room with a View</i>

715
00:38:51,728 --> 00:38:53,605
as the book that most influenced you.

716
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:55,230
Influenced me, too.

717
00:38:56,649 --> 00:39:00,069
George Emerson made for a
great icebreaker, didn't it?

718
00:39:03,114 --> 00:39:04,824
I've so loved getting to know you.

719
00:39:05,450 --> 00:39:08,453
You're so generous and so trusting

720
00:39:08,536 --> 00:39:11,289
you actually believed me
when I said that we hooked up.

721
00:39:12,373 --> 00:39:13,373
What?

722
00:39:14,959 --> 00:39:16,252
- You said...
- No.

723
00:39:18,713 --> 00:39:19,713
I'm not even gay.

724
00:39:20,089 --> 00:39:22,180
But you were so out of
your mind on ayahuasca,

725
00:39:22,181 --> 00:39:23,718
you would've believed anything.

726
00:39:24,177 --> 00:39:28,681
- Why would you... lie about that?
- I didn't want you running back to Sam.

727
00:39:30,141 --> 00:39:34,646
But then... you started feeling better,
talking about going home.

728
00:39:36,272 --> 00:39:38,274
I stole your passport, so you couldn't.

729
00:39:39,108 --> 00:39:42,070
Little did I know that that
would bring Sam and Fallon here.

730
00:39:42,654 --> 00:39:44,030
- Bonjour.
- [Fallon] <i>Bonjour.</i>

731
00:39:44,322 --> 00:39:46,824
<i>This is Fallon Carrington.
We'll be wheels down in an hour.</i>

732
00:39:46,908 --> 00:39:49,108
I wanna make sure the staff
is prepared for our arrival?

733
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:50,787
[in French] Yes, of course.

734
00:39:51,204 --> 00:39:53,414
[George] <i>I knew then that
I had to speed up the game.</i>

735
00:39:54,332 --> 00:39:55,332
[Steven] <i>What game?</i>

736
00:39:55,792 --> 00:39:59,212
- Hey there. Are you okay?
- [Sam] Are you? Who were you yelling at?

737
00:39:59,295 --> 00:40:01,440
<i>- The one we've been playing, Steven.</i>
- No one. I mean...

738
00:40:01,464 --> 00:40:03,840
George, we... It's not important.

739
00:40:03,841 --> 00:40:05,361
I'm glad you'll finally get to meet him.

740
00:40:05,385 --> 00:40:07,630
<i>See, all I had to do was
convince Sam and Fallon</i>

741
00:40:07,631 --> 00:40:09,263
<i>that you'd lost the plot.</i>

742
00:40:09,931 --> 00:40:11,910
<i>I couldn't have you
telling them about me, </i>

743
00:40:11,911 --> 00:40:14,560
<i>or rather have them believe you.</i>

744
00:40:15,353 --> 00:40:18,648
<i>And throw in your issues
with drugs and alcohol,</i>

745
00:40:18,773 --> 00:40:22,151
<i>and the fact that you were in the
middle of an identity crisis... </i>

746
00:40:22,235 --> 00:40:23,235
George?

747
00:40:24,904 --> 00:40:26,656
[operator] <i>We're sorry... </i>

748
00:40:29,909 --> 00:40:33,454
<i>I could've never imagined it
to go so spectacularly well.</i>

749
00:40:35,206 --> 00:40:36,206
You...

750
00:40:38,292 --> 00:40:39,335
[groans]

751
00:40:39,419 --> 00:40:40,503
You feeling drowsy?

752
00:40:41,838 --> 00:40:45,383
I gave you just a little
something to help you relax.

753
00:40:45,675 --> 00:40:46,675
Why would you... ?

754
00:40:48,678 --> 00:40:49,678
Why would you do... ?

755
00:40:49,721 --> 00:40:53,349
Better question, why would you
walk away from such a perfect life?

756
00:40:54,058 --> 00:40:57,895
See, all this started as
a sort of morbid curiosity.

757
00:40:58,896 --> 00:41:01,899
You know, to see firsthand the
life that I had been denied.

758
00:41:02,775 --> 00:41:08,948
And you were the easiest way in.
This wounded bird, so far from home.

759
00:41:09,949 --> 00:41:11,784
Away from the Carrington fortress.

760
00:41:12,869 --> 00:41:15,509
But then the more I got to know
you, the more I grew to resent you.

761
00:41:15,747 --> 00:41:18,166
How ungrateful you
are. You had everything.

762
00:41:19,876 --> 00:41:21,294
And you walked away from it.

763
00:41:23,046 --> 00:41:27,252
And now I'm going to claim it.
Everything my father gave you.

764
00:41:28,968 --> 00:41:29,932
You know, it's a real shame

765
00:41:29,933 --> 00:41:34,057
that you won't be there to
welcome me home... brother.

766
00:41:35,099 --> 00:41:36,142
Adam?

767
00:41:37,101 --> 00:41:38,519
But we'll always have Paris.

768
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:47,820
Cheerio...

769
00:42:28,978 --> 00:42:33,628
