to wait for what you want.

00:00:05,092 --> 00:00:07,362
Marry me.

00:00:07,398 --> 00:00:08,748
FALLON:
I can't do this anymore.

5
00:00:08,791 --> 00:00:10,011
I love Culhane.

6
00:00:10,053 --> 00:00:11,493
I'm sorry, Liam, but it's over.

7
00:00:11,533 --> 00:00:13,973
ANDERS:
I'd like you

8
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:15,544
to come and live here.Really?

9
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:16,710
I'd like that.

10
00:00:16,755 --> 00:00:17,965
That recording of Jeff

11
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:19,148
running an illegal card game

12
00:00:19,193 --> 00:00:21,503
in his innocent sister's club

13
00:00:21,543 --> 00:00:22,853
is my insurance you'll behave.

14
00:00:22,892 --> 00:00:24,202
Leave Monica out of this.

15
00:00:24,241 --> 00:00:26,331
I'm not the one who put
her club in my sights.

16
00:00:26,374 --> 00:00:27,594
For you, Sam.

17
00:00:27,636 --> 00:00:30,506
This card means new life.

18
00:00:30,552 --> 00:00:32,732
[baby crying]HANK: You'll never
have to see me again.

19
00:00:32,771 --> 00:00:34,081
I'm taking the money,
and I'm hitting the road

20
00:00:34,121 --> 00:00:36,081
like a lonesome wolf.
It's been a pleasure.

21
00:00:36,123 --> 00:00:37,303

ALEXIS:
Hold on, I'm coming!

24
00:00:47,221 --> 00:00:49,751
Randy, uh, did something happen
at the loft?

25
00:00:49,788 --> 00:00:51,008
We were supposed to meet
at 9:00?

26
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:52,231
To go over the final punch list.

27
00:00:52,269 --> 00:00:56,009
Oh, what time is it now?It's 11:30.

28
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:58,146
Look, I can come in now if...[baby fusses]

29
00:00:58,188 --> 00:01:00,228
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't realize you had a...

30
00:01:00,277 --> 00:01:02,757
A guest. Yes,
it's been a very long night.

31
00:01:02,801 --> 00:01:05,071
Uh, just give me 30 minutes,
and I'll freshen up.

32
00:01:05,891 --> 00:01:07,891
[baby crying]

33
00:01:09,895 --> 00:01:11,455
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

34
00:01:11,506 --> 00:01:13,026
No, no, no, no, none of that.

35
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:15,683
You've got to be
very, very quiet.

36
00:01:15,727 --> 00:01:17,857
Yeah, that's it. Shh, shh, shh.

37
00:01:17,903 --> 00:01:19,993
HANK: You've reached Hank.
I mean, you haven't,

38
00:01:20,036 --> 00:01:21,386
because I can't come
to the phone,

39
00:01:21,429 --> 00:01:23,649
but you've reached
my voice mail and...[beeps]

40
00:01:23,692 --> 00:01:25,302
Where are you, Hank?

41
00:01:25,346 --> 00:01:27,036
I don't know who the hell
this Claudia is

42
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:28,697
or why I have her baby,

43
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:31,130
but you need to come
and get it right now![baby crying]

44
00:01:31,178 --> 00:01:34,268
Shh, shh. No, no, no, no, no,
no, no. I'm trying, okay?

45
00:01:34,311 --> 00:01:35,571
I need you to work with me.

46
00:01:35,617 --> 00:01:38,447
Shh.

47
00:01:38,489 --> 00:01:40,929
Look, I don't want to get
the authorities involved, Hank.

48
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:42,890
But if they trace this baby
to you,

49
00:01:42,928 --> 00:01:46,108
they trace you to me,
and we both end up in handcuffs.

50
00:01:46,149 --> 00:01:49,149
I can't take care
of this infant.

51
00:01:49,196 --> 00:01:52,676
Oh, is this how people
without night nurses live?

52
00:01:52,721 --> 00:01:55,681
Oh, God. [sighs]

53
00:01:59,728 --> 00:02:01,858
You still want to get married?

54
00:02:01,904 --> 00:02:04,564
And do that every morning?

55
00:02:04,602 --> 00:02:06,652
I'm in.

56
00:02:10,434 --> 00:02:13,224
Let's get a ring
on that finger.

57
00:02:13,263 --> 00:02:16,443
I want the whole world
to know you're mine.[chuckles]

58
00:02:16,484 --> 00:02:19,364
Maybe we should start
with the whole family?

59
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,750
[sighs]
[chuckles]

60
00:02:20,792 --> 00:02:22,362
FALLON:
What are we waiting for?

61
00:02:22,403 --> 00:02:24,233
Doesn't Dad know
we all have things to do?

62
00:02:24,274 --> 00:02:26,194
Yeah, I have a massage in 30.

63
00:02:26,233 --> 00:02:28,193
The first
of the Christmas decorations

64
00:02:28,235 --> 00:02:29,405
will be here in a few minutes.

65
00:02:29,453 --> 00:02:30,593
It's a little early, isn't it?

66
00:02:30,628 --> 00:02:31,588
Thanksgiving's over.

67
00:02:31,629 --> 00:02:32,799
What's this even about?

68
00:02:32,848 --> 00:02:35,328
Maybe a Welcome Wagon
for your new neighbor?

69
00:02:35,372 --> 00:02:37,332
[door opens]Me.

70
00:02:37,374 --> 00:02:40,554
Oh, finally. Oh.

71
00:02:40,595 --> 00:02:41,985
What's going on here?

72
00:02:42,031 --> 00:02:43,951
Those bags under your eyes
are impressive, Alexis.

73
00:02:43,989 --> 00:02:45,899
Not getting enough rest out
in that tin can of yours?

74
00:02:46,905 --> 00:02:48,075
Kirby, that's enough.

75
00:02:48,124 --> 00:02:50,084
[sighs]Definitely a welcome addition.

76
00:02:50,126 --> 00:02:51,736
I really can't stay.
I have things to do.

77
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:55,040
Good, you're all here. I
hope you all got champagne.

78
00:02:56,001 --> 00:02:57,261
We have news to celebrate.

79
00:02:57,307 --> 00:02:59,477
Last night I asked
Cristal to marry me.

80
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:01,570
And she said yes.

81
00:03:01,616 --> 00:03:03,226
What? You're engaged?

82
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:04,230
Is she pregnant?

83
00:03:04,271 --> 00:03:05,451
SAM:
Oh, my God.

84
00:03:05,489 --> 00:03:06,969
What if that's the
baby the psychic meant

85
00:03:07,012 --> 00:03:09,282
and I just wanted to
believe it was for me?

86
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:11,369
I'm not pregnant.Thank God for that.

87
00:03:11,408 --> 00:03:13,238
This is not some shotgun
wedding, although...

88
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,240
I wouldn't mind a few little
feet running around here.

89
00:03:15,282 --> 00:03:16,242
Oh...

90
00:03:16,283 --> 00:03:17,243
Then what's the rush?

91
00:03:17,284 --> 00:03:18,554
I mean, the last one's
barely cold.

92
00:03:18,589 --> 00:03:20,239
Seriously, Fallon.BLAKE:
There's no rush.

93
00:03:20,287 --> 00:03:22,377
I promise, your
wedding will be first.

94
00:03:22,419 --> 00:03:23,639
That's not what I meant.

95
00:03:23,681 --> 00:03:24,901
If there's anything the
last year taught me,

96
00:03:24,943 --> 00:03:26,383
it's that life is precious.

97
00:03:26,423 --> 00:03:27,953
And short.

98
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:29,730
And I'm not gonna waste
any of it.

99
00:03:29,774 --> 00:03:31,994
It's time for a new chapter
around here.

100
00:03:36,781 --> 00:03:38,831
KIRBY:
Guess that means

101
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:40,260
yours is officially closing.

102
00:03:40,307 --> 00:03:42,397
Too bad.
It's been a real page-turner.

103
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:44,619
[sighs]ANDERS:
Not even a comment

104
00:03:44,659 --> 00:03:46,529
about the latest
Mrs. Carrington?

105
00:03:46,574 --> 00:03:48,624
You must be in a hurry.Clearly, I'm not the only one.

106
00:03:48,663 --> 00:03:51,233
But I have more
pressing concerns right now.

107
00:03:51,274 --> 00:03:54,064
Blake's whims tend
to work themselves out.

108
00:03:54,103 --> 00:03:55,763
Until he reproduces with them.

109
00:03:57,019 --> 00:03:59,019
[donkey brays]

110
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:05,290
Already?

111
00:04:05,332 --> 00:04:07,292
Well, how tacky.

112
00:04:26,353 --> 00:04:28,313
Van Kirk Industries, huh?

113
00:04:28,355 --> 00:04:31,305
Oh, I was just catching up

114
00:04:31,358 --> 00:04:33,228
on some news.

115
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:34,623
You hang onto some shares
in the C.A. sale,

116
00:04:34,665 --> 00:04:36,095
or just keeping tabs on Liam?

117
00:04:36,145 --> 00:04:38,055
Well, just because I sold
the company

118
00:04:38,103 --> 00:04:39,503
doesn't mean I forgot about it.

119
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:41,190
And it's still a part
of my family's legacy.

120
00:04:41,237 --> 00:04:43,327
Someone has to care,
and it's clearly not my dad.

121
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:45,240
Well, maybe he has
the right idea.

122
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,325
Seriously? I mean,
he's known this Cristal

123
00:04:47,374 --> 00:04:48,774
even shorter than the last one.

124
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:50,990
There's something to be said
for seizing the moment.

125
00:04:51,029 --> 00:04:52,339
[sighs]You know what,

126
00:04:52,379 --> 00:04:53,899
and he still said
that we could go first.

127
00:04:53,945 --> 00:04:56,165
Okay, well, I'm not having
my wedding date dictated

128
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:58,338
by my dad's whims.
Been there, done that.

129
00:04:58,385 --> 00:05:01,335
So what do you want to do?
Not get married?

130
00:05:01,388 --> 00:05:02,948
No, no.

131
00:05:02,998 --> 00:05:05,388
I just want to do it
on my own terms. Ourterms.

132
00:05:05,435 --> 00:05:07,655
But right now I have to go.

133
00:05:07,698 --> 00:05:09,738
I'm having lunch with Monica.

134
00:05:10,788 --> 00:05:12,398
Bye.[phone buzzing]

135
00:05:12,442 --> 00:05:14,442
Bye.

136
00:05:15,924 --> 00:05:17,884
JEFF:
There you are.

137
00:05:17,926 --> 00:05:20,096
My guys want to know if we're on
for the game Tuesday.

138
00:05:20,145 --> 00:05:22,495
Yeah, we're good.

139
00:05:22,539 --> 00:05:25,409
All right.

140
00:05:25,455 --> 00:05:28,195
You are an angel
for helping me.

141
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,550
I just can't decide
on this accent wall,

142
00:05:30,591 --> 00:05:32,461
and you have got
such a great eye.

143
00:05:32,506 --> 00:05:35,116
Mm-hmm. Just as long
as I don't have to paint it.

144
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,420
Olga just worked the knots
out of my shoulder.[baby cooing]

145
00:05:37,467 --> 00:05:39,427
What's that?

146
00:05:39,469 --> 00:05:41,379
Is that a baby?

147
00:05:41,428 --> 00:05:44,468
Sound effects? A little extra.

Oh, my God.

It's real.

You must be joking.Hey, buddy.

151
00:05:53,701 --> 00:05:56,491
Where'd you come from?
You're okay. Shh, shh, shh.

00:05:56,530 --> 00:06:00,060
You're good, buddy. Hey.

153
00:06:00,098 --> 00:06:02,708
Oh, look, there's a note.

a baby in the manger.Whose baby?

What baby?

00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:17,590
Oh, sweet Mary and Joseph.

Who would leave a baby

00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:50,628
see if anyone's misplaced
their offspring.

166
00:06:50,671 --> 00:06:52,981
Maybe we should call the police.

167
00:06:53,021 --> 00:06:54,501
I just got off the phone
with Child Services.

168
00:06:54,544 --> 00:06:56,554
What? You read the note.

169
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:58,240
Well, we don't know who
wrote the note, Sam.

170
00:06:58,287 --> 00:06:59,547
What if somebody took him?

171
00:06:59,593 --> 00:07:01,123
Like they did Adam.

172
00:07:01,159 --> 00:07:03,289
Well, they had no
missing children reported,

173
00:07:03,335 --> 00:07:04,505
so they said
they'd send somebody

174
00:07:04,554 --> 00:07:05,994
as soon as they
can, but you know

175
00:07:06,034 --> 00:07:08,304
how underfunded these agencies
are. It could take days.

176
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:11,610
Days? What are we supposed to do
with it until then? Keep it?

177
00:07:11,648 --> 00:07:13,778
He's better off here
than in some orphanage.

178
00:07:13,824 --> 00:07:15,224
They have foster homes.

179
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:17,520
No one's gonna take better care
of him than we are.

180
00:07:17,567 --> 00:07:18,657
I think God

181
00:07:18,699 --> 00:07:21,179
put him here for me to find.

182
00:07:21,223 --> 00:07:23,183
You'd think God
would know better.SAM: I'm serious.

183
00:07:23,225 --> 00:07:25,225
I've been praying for a baby,

184
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:26,450
and he needs a family.

185
00:07:26,489 --> 00:07:28,189
It's like a textbook miracle.

186
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:29,450
Let's not get carried away.

187
00:07:29,492 --> 00:07:30,712
Well, he's probably
better off here

188
00:07:30,754 --> 00:07:31,634
than in a foster home.

189
00:07:31,668 --> 00:07:32,838
And he does even look

190
00:07:32,887 --> 00:07:34,847
a little bit like you, Blake.

191
00:07:36,543 --> 00:07:38,763
Are you just a little Blake?

192
00:07:38,806 --> 00:07:39,976
Huh?
BLAKE:
Let me see him.

193
00:07:40,721 --> 00:07:43,641
[baby fusses]

194
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,990
Yeah. Hey.

195
00:07:47,031 --> 00:07:48,561
Oh!

196
00:07:48,598 --> 00:07:51,038
And that's my cue to leave.

197
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:54,000
It'll come out in the wash.

198
00:07:55,387 --> 00:07:57,297
Yeah, not my first rodeo.

199
00:07:57,346 --> 00:07:59,386
Those were good days,
weren't they?

200
00:07:59,435 --> 00:08:00,645
When the kids were babies.

201
00:08:00,697 --> 00:08:02,257
Yeah, before they could talk.

202
00:08:02,307 --> 00:08:05,437
You know, maybe Sam's right.
This is a sign,

203
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,225
this baby, for us, too.

204
00:08:07,269 --> 00:08:09,749
I mean, as the psychic said,
you and I share a destiny.

205
00:08:09,793 --> 00:08:12,673
Nobody wants Steven and Sam
to have a family more than I do,

206
00:08:12,709 --> 00:08:14,019
and if this is their baby,

207
00:08:14,058 --> 00:08:15,888
no one would be happier.

208
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:19,500
I knew you felt it.
Somewhere in there...

209
00:08:19,542 --> 00:08:21,852
But us becoming grandparents

210
00:08:21,892 --> 00:08:23,762
to that kid or any other

211
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:25,677
doesn't mean we'd be
doing it together.

212
00:08:25,722 --> 00:08:27,252
Because if there is such a thing
as destiny,

213
00:08:27,289 --> 00:08:28,379
mine is with Cristal.

214
00:08:29,813 --> 00:08:32,423
Move on, Alexis.

215
00:08:32,468 --> 00:08:35,248
♪ And every time

216
00:08:35,297 --> 00:08:39,777
♪ I close my eyes
it's you and me ♪

217
00:08:39,823 --> 00:08:43,483
♪ I feel your energy

218
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:46,923
♪ In all these lucid dreams

219
00:08:46,961 --> 00:08:50,531
♪ I really wanted you to stay

220
00:08:50,573 --> 00:08:55,403
♪ Ever since you went away.

221
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,490
You don't even need
the sound system,

222
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,708
but I'll have my best mixer
here on Tuesday night.

223
00:09:00,757 --> 00:09:01,797
Can I come, too?

224
00:09:01,845 --> 00:09:02,975
I might be able
to pull a few strings,

225
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:04,370
get you on the list.

226
00:09:04,413 --> 00:09:08,463
Isis, Alexe, this is
Fallon Carrington. This is...

227
00:09:08,504 --> 00:09:11,684
St. Beauty. I'm a fan.Isis is a friend

228
00:09:11,725 --> 00:09:14,595
from way back.You're lucky
you can still book us.

229
00:09:14,641 --> 00:09:16,601
I first saw them at a showcase.

230
00:09:16,643 --> 00:09:18,383
Then they get signed
by Wondaland,

231
00:09:18,427 --> 00:09:20,167
suddenly they are
too cool for me.

232
00:09:20,211 --> 00:09:23,261
Hey. Monica, you should
do a showcase here.

233
00:09:23,301 --> 00:09:25,611
With your club. I mean, you've
always had an eye for talent,

234
00:09:25,652 --> 00:09:27,392
and there's plenty in Atlanta
waiting to be signed.

235
00:09:27,436 --> 00:09:28,956
Except I don't have
a record label.

236
00:09:29,003 --> 00:09:31,883
Why not?Okay, I'm still
figuring out this business.

237
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:33,919
Speaking of which,
I'll see you guys Tuesday?

238
00:09:33,964 --> 00:09:35,844
We'll be here.
Good to meet you, Fallon.

239
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:38,269
You, too.

240
00:09:38,316 --> 00:09:40,136
I can help you. I know
how to start a company--

241
00:09:40,188 --> 00:09:42,408
ask your brother--
and I know how to run one, too.

242
00:09:42,451 --> 00:09:43,971
Don't ask your brother.

243
00:09:44,018 --> 00:09:45,668
Are you really suggesting
that we start a record label?

244
00:09:45,715 --> 00:09:47,105
Together?

245
00:09:47,151 --> 00:09:49,501
We can use this as a launchpad.
We bring the artists

246
00:09:49,545 --> 00:09:50,805
directly to the audience.

247
00:09:50,851 --> 00:09:52,851
Can be independent, female-run.

248
00:09:52,896 --> 00:09:54,716
You know I love you,
but I don't think

249
00:09:54,768 --> 00:09:56,678
working together
is the best idea for us.

250
00:09:56,726 --> 00:09:57,676
Did you already forget

251
00:09:57,727 --> 00:09:59,287
the drama we had
over this place?

252
00:09:59,337 --> 00:10:00,427
Oh, that was different.

253
00:10:00,469 --> 00:10:02,209
You just finished
selling a company.

254
00:10:02,253 --> 00:10:03,653
Why don't you take a minute

255
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:05,300
to just... do you?

256
00:10:05,343 --> 00:10:07,263
But this is me. I work.

257
00:10:07,302 --> 00:10:08,832
And I need something
to focus on.

258
00:10:08,869 --> 00:10:10,959
Wow, you really don't want
to plan a wedding, do you?

259
00:10:11,001 --> 00:10:14,001
But I'm not trying to be
someone's project, Fallon.

260
00:10:14,048 --> 00:10:15,348
I'm sure you'll find
another one.

261
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:18,533
Can you wait
ten more minutes to eat?

262
00:10:18,574 --> 00:10:20,714
I need to go check inventory.

263
00:10:24,754 --> 00:10:26,454
What a lovely coat.

264
00:10:26,495 --> 00:10:27,835
Is that a polyblend?

265
00:10:27,888 --> 00:10:30,758
It's cashmere, actually.
But thank you.

266
00:10:30,804 --> 00:10:33,984
Pretty flowers. Weren't those
in the dining room this morning?

267
00:10:34,024 --> 00:10:36,034
Just borrowing a few odds
and ends for my place

268
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:37,640
until I have time
to go shopping.

269
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,990
Is the loft finished already?

270
00:10:39,029 --> 00:10:40,899
Things move fast
around here.

271
00:10:40,944 --> 00:10:42,554
You don't have to tell me.

272
00:10:42,598 --> 00:10:44,208
And now we have
a baby here, too.

273
00:10:44,252 --> 00:10:47,782
I just can't wait to put down
new roots. Literally.

274
00:10:47,821 --> 00:10:50,041
We've been through a lot
as a family, but...

275
00:10:50,084 --> 00:10:52,614
that's what family is:
people with...

276
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:53,912
a shared history.

277
00:10:53,957 --> 00:10:55,737
And Blake and I have a long one.

278
00:10:55,785 --> 00:10:58,785
I'm just looking forward
to a long future here.

279
00:10:58,832 --> 00:11:00,752
Make sure you don't
overwater that dracaena.

280
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:02,920
Roots can rot, you know?

281
00:11:02,966 --> 00:11:04,656
[laughs]

282
00:11:04,707 --> 00:11:06,667
How sweet of you.

283
00:11:06,709 --> 00:11:09,059
You know, if I were you,
I'd get out now,

284
00:11:09,103 --> 00:11:11,673
while that pure little heart
is still in one piece.

285
00:11:11,714 --> 00:11:13,154
This may seem like
a big house,

286
00:11:13,194 --> 00:11:16,464
but... there's
only so much room.

287
00:11:16,501 --> 00:11:18,721
I know this is moving fast...

288
00:11:18,765 --> 00:11:21,765
but I love Blake,
and I think he loves me, too.

289
00:11:21,811 --> 00:11:24,951
Since we're about to
go to look at rings.

290
00:11:24,988 --> 00:11:27,028
[chuckles]: Oh.
I'm surprised that jeweler

291
00:11:27,077 --> 00:11:29,857
hasn't given him
a punch card by now.

292
00:11:29,906 --> 00:11:31,686
Don't say I didn't warn you.

293
00:11:34,998 --> 00:11:37,168
I got it. Don't worry.

294
00:11:37,218 --> 00:11:38,738
[door closes]

295
00:11:38,785 --> 00:11:40,085
ANDERS:
So, seam on the outside,

296
00:11:40,134 --> 00:11:42,614
and fold on the inside.

297
00:11:42,658 --> 00:11:43,918
Thank you.

298
00:11:43,964 --> 00:11:46,014
[groans] Has that dog
ever been on a leash?

299
00:11:46,053 --> 00:11:48,933
We'll have to work on that.As wonderful as it is

300
00:11:48,969 --> 00:11:51,839
that you want to take Bo
under your wing,

301
00:11:51,885 --> 00:11:54,185
and as glad as I am to
have you staying here,

302
00:11:54,235 --> 00:11:57,585
um, has it ever occurred to you
to perhaps get a job?

303
00:11:57,629 --> 00:11:59,369
I mean, outside of the home?

304
00:11:59,414 --> 00:12:01,204
That's very feminist
of you, Daddy.

305
00:12:01,242 --> 00:12:03,902
Don't forget you still
owe a heavy sum to Steven

306
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:05,200
for that stunt you
pulled in Paraguay

307
00:12:05,246 --> 00:12:06,896
using his credit card.

308
00:12:06,943 --> 00:12:09,513
I'll fill out some applications.

309
00:12:09,554 --> 00:12:10,954
Hey.

310
00:12:10,991 --> 00:12:12,691
Is this thing on right?

311
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:14,122
Where did you even get that?

312
00:12:14,168 --> 00:12:15,168
The baby shower.

313
00:12:15,212 --> 00:12:16,952
At least some good
came out of it.

314
00:12:16,997 --> 00:12:18,517
We have almost
everything we need.

315
00:12:18,563 --> 00:12:20,443
Just like it was
meant to be.

316
00:12:20,478 --> 00:12:22,438
Until Child Services arrive.

317
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,740
And when they come,

318
00:12:23,786 --> 00:12:25,826
they'll see Little Blake
has everything here.

319
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:27,785
Obviously,
I'm gonna need some help.

320
00:12:27,834 --> 00:12:29,574
At least until
Steven's back.

321
00:12:29,618 --> 00:12:30,968
I can help.

322
00:12:32,055 --> 00:12:34,925
At least until I get a job.You realize

323
00:12:34,971 --> 00:12:37,971
that a nanny is responsible
for another human being?

324
00:12:38,018 --> 00:12:39,928
Yeah, and she
could barely handle Bo.

325
00:12:41,064 --> 00:12:42,114
But...

326
00:12:42,152 --> 00:12:43,942
you could be, like,
my assistant.

327
00:12:44,894 --> 00:12:46,244
I'd pay you, of course.

328
00:12:47,201 --> 00:12:49,551
I already owe you and Steven,

329
00:12:49,594 --> 00:12:52,344
so why don't we
just call it even?

330
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:56,340
Sold. First order of business:
finding an actual nanny.

331
00:12:56,384 --> 00:12:57,864
ANDERS:
If you insist,

332
00:12:57,907 --> 00:12:59,947
we might as well do it right.

333
00:12:59,996 --> 00:13:01,646
I'll pull some résumés.

334
00:13:01,693 --> 00:13:02,833
Perfect.

335
00:13:02,869 --> 00:13:04,219
Ooh.

336
00:13:04,261 --> 00:13:07,311
[sniffs] Kirby,
can you run point?

337
00:13:07,351 --> 00:13:09,611
Someone needs
a new diaper.

338
00:13:11,051 --> 00:13:12,491
How about...

339
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:13,880
this one?

340
00:13:13,923 --> 00:13:16,063
It's beautiful.

341
00:13:16,099 --> 00:13:17,269
See?

342
00:13:17,318 --> 00:13:19,708
I have good taste in
the important things.

343
00:13:19,755 --> 00:13:21,405
[laughs]
Yes.

344
00:13:21,452 --> 00:13:22,982
Alexis mentioned.

345
00:13:23,019 --> 00:13:26,069
She made sure to remind me
that you've done this before.

346
00:13:26,109 --> 00:13:27,889
And that doesn't matter.

347
00:13:27,937 --> 00:13:30,677
I know. I know.

348
00:13:30,722 --> 00:13:32,162
But I don't think she likes me.

349
00:13:32,202 --> 00:13:34,292
What did she say?That she didn't like me.

350
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:36,075
[chuckles]And how the two of you

351
00:13:36,119 --> 00:13:38,989
have a long history together,
and I should get out

352
00:13:39,035 --> 00:13:40,985
before my heart
gets broken.Hey, hey,

353
00:13:41,037 --> 00:13:42,257
Alexis is delusional.

354
00:13:42,299 --> 00:13:44,389
It was that damn
psychic, I swear.

355
00:13:44,432 --> 00:13:47,222
Apparently, she told Alexis that
we were meant to be together,

356
00:13:47,261 --> 00:13:48,871
and Alexis ate it up.

357
00:13:48,915 --> 00:13:52,005
Adriana has a strong intuition.So do I.

358
00:13:52,048 --> 00:13:55,048
I don't need a psychic to
tell me how I feel about you.

359
00:13:55,095 --> 00:13:57,915
And I sure as hell
don't need Alexis.

360
00:13:57,967 --> 00:14:00,397
And I'm relieved to hear that.

361
00:14:04,191 --> 00:14:06,851
Do you have any more?MAN:
Of course, sir.

362
00:14:07,934 --> 00:14:09,284
What is that?

363
00:14:09,326 --> 00:14:11,106
Well, obviously,
nothing is set in stone;

an idea of what I'm thinking.

that in the last 20 minutes?Mm-hmm.

in your head...

experience and strategic vision

You have the creative judgment.

We both have the capital.

372
00:14:29,738 --> 00:14:32,348
We could be
equal partners, 50-50.

that in writing?
Sure.

Culhane, or...?

No. No, no, no.

377
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,100
This is not
about my wedding.

378
00:14:42,142 --> 00:14:44,802
This is about me.
I told you I work.

379
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:47,060
What I'm thinking is we build
on what you already have.

talent in Atlanta.

383

A showcase.

384
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:56,980
Now that you mention it,
there's a utility room upstairs

385
00:14:57,026 --> 00:14:58,506
that could be a greenroom.

386
00:14:58,549 --> 00:15:00,329
Does that mean you're in?

387
00:15:00,377 --> 00:15:02,677
Let's just start with Tuesday
and see how it goes.

388
00:15:02,727 --> 00:15:04,987
I'll have Jeff get his
poker tables out of there.

Poker?

390
00:15:06,122 --> 00:15:07,952
I let him have a game up there

391
00:15:07,994 --> 00:15:10,394

busy getting divorced from Liam.

392
00:15:10,431 --> 00:15:13,561
Well, maybe he'll invite me
to the next one.

393
00:15:13,608 --> 00:15:15,958
ALEXIS:
Please be gentle with those.

394
00:15:16,002 --> 00:15:18,962
There are antiques in there that
are worth more than your car.

395
00:15:19,005 --> 00:15:20,435
Yes, Ms. Carrington.Actually, put them

396
00:15:20,484 --> 00:15:22,754

I'll empty it myself.

I'm also gonna need to borrow a
few things from the main house:

the good silver trays,
Lalique decanters...

399
00:15:28,579 --> 00:15:30,099
I think Mr. Anders might notice.

400
00:15:30,146 --> 00:15:32,056
Well, they're
not for me, dear.

401
00:15:32,105 --> 00:15:36,105
I want to have everyone over for
a little family housewarming.

that I'm here to stay

00:33:45,806 --> 00:33:47,756
I killed your plants.

873
00:33:47,808 --> 00:33:50,588
You should know what you're
going to bed with every night.

874
00:33:50,637 --> 00:33:51,767
Told you Cristal was a liar.

875
00:33:51,812 --> 00:33:53,942
[sighs]
She's right.

876
00:33:53,988 --> 00:33:55,418
I'm so sorry, Blake.

877
00:33:55,468 --> 00:33:56,818
ALEXIS:
I wish

878
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:58,510
I hated to say
I told you so.

879
00:34:00,125 --> 00:34:01,815
BLAKE:
Would you, uh,

880
00:34:01,865 --> 00:34:04,035
give us a moment, please?

881
00:34:10,352 --> 00:34:13,402
I was going to give
you a ring today...

882
00:34:13,442 --> 00:34:15,402
I totally understand
if you want to call off

883
00:34:15,444 --> 00:34:16,794
the engagement,
but if you will

884
00:34:16,837 --> 00:34:18,447
just give me the chance
to explain...

885
00:34:18,491 --> 00:34:19,881
Instead, I'm gonna
give you this.

886
00:34:19,927 --> 00:34:21,187
You're right.

887
00:34:21,233 --> 00:34:24,113
We haven't known each
other very long at all.

888
00:34:24,149 --> 00:34:25,979
But...

889
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:28,500
that just means we have
a chance to grow together.

890
00:34:30,851 --> 00:34:32,071
[chuckles softly]

891
00:34:32,113 --> 00:34:33,253
What is this?

892
00:34:33,288 --> 00:34:35,768
There's a diamond in there.
Somewhere.

893
00:34:35,812 --> 00:34:38,552
We can find it and
polish it and make a ring.

894
00:34:38,598 --> 00:34:40,248
Together.

895
00:34:40,295 --> 00:34:41,685
And don't worry
about Alexis.

896
00:34:41,731 --> 00:34:44,081
She's the thorn that
just keeps on pricking.

897
00:34:45,605 --> 00:34:46,905
It'll work itself out.

898
00:34:46,954 --> 00:34:48,224
Mm.

899
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:49,910
I know it will.

900
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:56,440
[exhales]

901
00:34:56,485 --> 00:34:58,615
Here.Thank you.

902
00:34:58,661 --> 00:35:00,881
You scared the hell
out of me, Mon.

903
00:35:00,924 --> 00:35:02,234
When I couldn't
find you in there,

904
00:35:02,274 --> 00:35:03,844
when I didn't know
what had happened to you...

905
00:35:03,884 --> 00:35:07,154
Hey. Except for a broken ankle
and some broken shoes,

906
00:35:07,192 --> 00:35:08,152
I'm fine.

907
00:35:08,193 --> 00:35:10,413
Though they were
expensive.

908
00:35:10,456 --> 00:35:12,066
[chuckles]

909
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:15,030
It wasn't your
fault, Jeff.

910
00:35:16,984 --> 00:35:19,384
Actually, it kind of was.

911
00:35:20,814 --> 00:35:22,214
I've been lying to you, Moni.

912
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:24,080
And I was just trying
to protect you, and...

913
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:25,082
Lying about what?

914
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:29,080
[shuddering exhale]

915
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:32,298
[footsteps approaching]

916
00:35:32,347 --> 00:35:33,907
Hey. You okay?

917
00:35:33,957 --> 00:35:35,657
I can't believe I am.

918
00:35:35,698 --> 00:35:37,218
I can't believe
Monica got out of there

919
00:35:37,265 --> 00:35:38,915
with just a broken ankle.
I mean,

920
00:35:38,962 --> 00:35:40,012
we're lucky nobody was killed.

921
00:35:40,050 --> 00:35:42,100
Yeah, just
the showcase.

922
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,880
Yeah. And the label,
for now.

923
00:35:44,925 --> 00:35:47,705
Monica's spooked.
Not that I can blame her.

924
00:35:47,754 --> 00:35:49,194
Yeah, I'm sorry.

925
00:35:49,234 --> 00:35:50,584
Me too.

926
00:35:50,626 --> 00:35:52,106
But, you know,
when everything was happening,

927
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:54,280
that was the last thing
on my mind.

928
00:35:54,326 --> 00:35:56,366
All I could think
about was you.

929
00:35:56,415 --> 00:35:57,975
I just wanted to find you.

930
00:35:58,025 --> 00:35:59,895
I wanted to have you with me.

931
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:03,120
I'm right here.

932
00:36:06,338 --> 00:36:08,298
Michael, I have
to tell you something.

933
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:12,128
I kissed Liam
at the divorce party.

934
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:15,560
And he convinced me
to do this last kiss thing,

935
00:36:15,608 --> 00:36:16,568
but it was me.

936
00:36:16,609 --> 00:36:18,389
And it scared me,

937
00:36:18,437 --> 00:36:20,607
that I might
still have feelings for him.

938
00:36:20,656 --> 00:36:22,306
I know.

939
00:36:23,572 --> 00:36:25,142
I heard you on the phone.

940
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:26,493
Why didn't you say anything?

941
00:36:26,532 --> 00:36:28,012
You didn't.

942
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:30,966
You're right.

943
00:36:31,014 --> 00:36:32,974
But I don't have feelings
for him, Michael.

944
00:36:33,016 --> 00:36:34,976
I know that now.

945
00:36:35,018 --> 00:36:36,628
And I am all-in on us.

946
00:36:36,672 --> 00:36:39,152
I want us to get married
as soon as we can,

947
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:41,157
so I never have to be scared
of losing you again.

948
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,240
Fallon.

949
00:36:43,288 --> 00:36:45,248
Yeah.

950
00:36:49,642 --> 00:36:52,082
I don't ever want
to lose you either.

951
00:36:57,824 --> 00:36:59,784
[birds chirping]

952
00:37:01,915 --> 00:37:03,255
JENNINGS:
Sam.

953
00:37:03,308 --> 00:37:05,048
I'm glad I caught you.

954
00:37:05,092 --> 00:37:07,312
I have a favor to ask.

955
00:37:07,355 --> 00:37:08,485
Yes?This might

956
00:37:08,530 --> 00:37:09,660
sound odd,

957
00:37:09,705 --> 00:37:11,485
but could you pop
by Alexis' trailer

958
00:37:11,533 --> 00:37:12,933
and check her size for me?

959
00:37:12,969 --> 00:37:15,099
Her clothes got ruined
the other night,

960
00:37:15,145 --> 00:37:16,495
and I want to
replace them.

961
00:37:16,538 --> 00:37:18,708
A peace offering, if you will.

962
00:37:18,758 --> 00:37:21,408
Well, the best way to her heart
isprobably presents.

963
00:37:21,456 --> 00:37:23,106
[chuckles]
My thoughts exactly.

964
00:37:23,153 --> 00:37:26,773
I'd go myself, but I wanted it
to be a surprise.

965
00:37:26,809 --> 00:37:27,899
Sure.

966
00:37:27,941 --> 00:37:29,161
Gracias.

967
00:37:29,203 --> 00:37:30,643
De nada.

968
00:37:30,683 --> 00:37:32,213
ADA:
I'm impressed
by your ingenuity.

969
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,860
And I don't give out
compliments easily.

970
00:37:34,904 --> 00:37:36,434
Screw you.

971
00:37:36,471 --> 00:37:39,171
You once told me not to bluff
against the dominant hand.

972
00:37:39,213 --> 00:37:42,173
Well, I'm folding.

973
00:37:42,216 --> 00:37:43,256
Done.

974
00:37:43,304 --> 00:37:44,704
You're calling me out
on my hand?

975
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:47,130
Trust me, you don't
want me to play it.

976
00:37:47,177 --> 00:37:49,747
Everything that happened
last night-- that was you.

977
00:37:49,789 --> 00:37:52,179
You're here,
exactly where you are,

978
00:37:52,226 --> 00:37:55,096
because of a series
of decisions that you made.

979
00:37:55,142 --> 00:37:56,712
You're not going anywhere.

980
00:37:56,752 --> 00:38:00,192
I have a very important client I
was hoping to host at the game.

981
00:38:00,234 --> 00:38:02,114
Hence my disappointment.
But...

982
00:38:02,149 --> 00:38:03,889
it's not too late
for you to redeem yourself.

983
00:38:03,933 --> 00:38:06,153
I'll let go of the club
and your blackmail

984
00:38:06,196 --> 00:38:08,156
if you do
one last thing.

985
00:38:08,198 --> 00:38:11,028
Let me guess, you want me
to deal the cards now.

986
00:38:11,071 --> 00:38:12,291
Cute.

987
00:38:12,333 --> 00:38:13,473
But no.

988
00:38:13,508 --> 00:38:15,858
I need you to pick
something up for me.

989
00:38:15,902 --> 00:38:17,342
I'll be in touch.

990
00:38:28,958 --> 00:38:30,698
[knocking]

991
00:38:32,092 --> 00:38:35,102
Who is it?

992
00:38:35,138 --> 00:38:36,398
Oh, my God.

993
00:38:36,444 --> 00:38:38,054
Don't tell me you're still here.

994
00:38:38,098 --> 00:38:39,838
[chuckles]I thought
you were

995
00:38:39,882 --> 00:38:41,412
just a temporary infestation.

996
00:38:41,449 --> 00:38:44,099
I thought you could use
some help cleaning up.

997
00:38:45,497 --> 00:38:48,107
Well, the floors are still
a bit damp, and I am

998
00:38:48,151 --> 00:38:49,411
having a housewarming
this evening.

999
00:38:49,457 --> 00:38:51,017
Oh.You could probably

1000
00:38:51,067 --> 00:38:53,507
hold a blow dryer
without burning the place down.

1001
00:38:53,548 --> 00:38:55,508
Just don't hold it too close,
and keep it moving.

1002
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:57,860
Okay.

1003
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:00,080
Mm, some towels might help.

1004
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,080
What are you doing?

1005
00:39:01,121 --> 00:39:02,211
Don't open that.

1006
00:39:03,950 --> 00:39:05,690
Why?

1007
00:39:05,734 --> 00:39:07,484
Were you hiding something
in here?

1008
00:39:09,085 --> 00:39:11,215
Oh, that's right. You were.

1009
00:39:11,261 --> 00:39:13,261
I didn't mean to!

1010
00:39:13,307 --> 00:39:14,607
I'm sorry!
Do you have any towels?!

1011
00:39:14,656 --> 00:39:18,086
You've done enough
damage already!

1012
00:39:18,138 --> 00:39:20,008
Imagine my surprise
when I went,

1013
00:39:20,053 --> 00:39:21,403
the other night,
looking for towels

1014
00:39:21,446 --> 00:39:23,706
and found the Baby Jesus
instead.

1015
00:39:23,752 --> 00:39:25,152
The same one

1016
00:39:25,188 --> 00:39:27,188
that's been missing
from the nativity scene

1017
00:39:27,234 --> 00:39:28,504
since Little Blake showed up.

1018
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:31,020
Obviously, you are
desperate to keep Blake.

1019
00:39:31,064 --> 00:39:32,204
[chuckles]But this is

1020
00:39:32,239 --> 00:39:33,199
a whole new level,

1021
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:34,200
accusing me of...

1022
00:39:34,241 --> 00:39:35,201
[stammers]

1023
00:39:35,242 --> 00:39:36,502
I don't even know what.

1024
00:39:36,548 --> 00:39:38,248
Of course you'd think
this was about Blake.

1025
00:39:38,288 --> 00:39:40,938
You admitted it.I said what
you wanted to hear.

1026
00:39:40,987 --> 00:39:42,207
I knew what you thought.

1027
00:39:42,249 --> 00:39:44,379
That I was weak, naive.

1028
00:39:44,425 --> 00:39:46,335
That you could bully me out
of here.

1029
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:48,264
You know, if I were you,
I'd get out now,

1030
00:39:48,298 --> 00:39:51,168
while that pure little heart
is still in one piece.

1031
00:39:51,214 --> 00:39:54,174
This may seem
like a big house, but...

1032
00:39:54,217 --> 00:39:56,257
JENNINGS:
"There's only so much room."

1033
00:39:56,306 --> 00:39:57,306
Right?

1034
00:39:58,352 --> 00:40:00,662
So you didn't kill my plants?

1035
00:40:00,702 --> 00:40:03,312
Oh, I did. To give you
a taste of your own medicine.

1036
00:40:03,357 --> 00:40:05,137
And I set off
those sprinklers, too.

1037
00:40:05,185 --> 00:40:07,875
Because if one of us had to go, it wasn't gonna be me.

1038
00:40:07,927 --> 00:40:10,147
[beeping]Oh, no.

1039
00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:11,970
Clearly, that wasn't
a permanent solution.

1040
00:40:12,018 --> 00:40:14,188
Water dries.

1041
00:40:14,237 --> 00:40:16,887
So when I saw the Baby Jesus,
I realized it was better

1042
00:40:16,936 --> 00:40:19,586
than anything I could come up
with to drive you out.

1043
00:40:19,634 --> 00:40:20,684
And when you came running in

1044
00:40:20,722 --> 00:40:22,292
to show me all
the flickering lights

1045
00:40:22,332 --> 00:40:24,252
and the banging pipes...

1046
00:40:24,291 --> 00:40:26,251
It must be 100 degrees in here.

1047
00:40:26,293 --> 00:40:28,123
...I realized you were
trying to call my bluff,

1048
00:40:28,164 --> 00:40:29,564
daring me to fold.

1049
00:40:29,601 --> 00:40:32,471
Going bigger and bigger
to scare me into a confession.

1050
00:40:32,517 --> 00:40:34,297
And it worked.

1051
00:40:34,344 --> 00:40:36,744
But if you knew,
why'd you play along?

1052
00:40:36,782 --> 00:40:39,352
No, because it couldn't
be too easy.

1053
00:40:39,393 --> 00:40:41,223
I needed you to believe
it was genuine...

1054
00:40:41,264 --> 00:40:44,314
I will have the cleaning fees
added to your bill

1055
00:40:44,354 --> 00:40:46,314
when you leave.

1056
00:40:48,271 --> 00:40:51,321
Really?
Google Translate?

1057
00:40:51,361 --> 00:40:53,801
Bitch.

1058
00:40:53,842 --> 00:40:56,282
...so when I finally gave it up,
you'd run right to Blake.

1059
00:40:56,323 --> 00:40:58,333
That was all the time I needed.

1060
00:40:58,368 --> 00:40:59,668
I told you Cristal
was a liar.

1061
00:40:59,718 --> 00:41:01,238
[sighs]
She's right.

1062
00:41:01,284 --> 00:41:04,644
And where is this Baby Jesus?

1063
00:41:04,679 --> 00:41:05,899
Did you give him to Blake?

1064
00:41:05,941 --> 00:41:07,771
I thought of it.

1065
00:41:07,813 --> 00:41:09,733
But I knew if I was
the one to discover it,

1066
00:41:09,771 --> 00:41:11,341
you might just say
that I framed you.

1067
00:41:11,381 --> 00:41:14,251
I needed someone else
to find it.

1068
00:41:14,297 --> 00:41:17,557
So I asked Sam
to do me a little favor.

1069
00:41:17,605 --> 00:41:19,165
Hello?

1070
00:41:21,566 --> 00:41:24,216
What the hell?

1071
00:41:24,264 --> 00:41:26,274
JENNINGS:
What is he going to think
when he finds

1072
00:41:26,309 --> 00:41:28,179
the Baby Jesus
in an old car seat

1073
00:41:28,224 --> 00:41:31,314
in your trailer, Alexis?You put it there.

1074
00:41:31,358 --> 00:41:33,098
When he realizes
that you're the one

1075
00:41:33,142 --> 00:41:34,932
who put the baby in that manger.

1076
00:41:34,970 --> 00:41:36,360
That you've been lying to him.

1077
00:41:36,406 --> 00:41:38,366
To the whole family.

1078
00:41:38,408 --> 00:41:40,278
Preying on their emotions,

1079
00:41:40,323 --> 00:41:42,803
just so you can get your claws
back into Blake.

1080
00:41:42,848 --> 00:41:45,628
Oy, that's positively
Shakespearean.

1081
00:41:45,677 --> 00:41:49,587
What's the phrase,
"hoisted on your own petard"?

1082
00:41:49,637 --> 00:41:52,597
I can explain.

1083
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,560
Maybe you should start with

1084
00:41:54,599 --> 00:41:56,949
where the hell
you got that baby.
