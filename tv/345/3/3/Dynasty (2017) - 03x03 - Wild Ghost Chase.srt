- of murder, how do you plead?
- Not guilty, Your Honor.

3
00:00:04,577 --> 00:00:06,350
Your request for bail is denied.

4
00:00:06,385 --> 00:00:08,151
I'm remanding you back into custody.

5

- You're not the father, Steven.

but I am ready to atone.

19
00:00:32,271 --> 00:00:35,406
I'm sentencing you to 100
hours of community service.

20
00:00:35,416 --> 00:00:37,199
- I was supposed to be there for Blake.
- They made me

21
00:00:37,276 --> 00:00:39,086
acting CEO of the winery.

22

Mm, has a nice ring to it.

29
00:01:01,597 --> 00:01:03,039
Actually, it makes me think of Alexis.

30
00:01:03,116 --> 00:01:05,167
I may have to stick with Cristal.

31
00:01:05,243 --> 00:01:07,794
But, speaking of rings,
you need a welder's mask

32
00:01:07,871 --> 00:01:09,671
to look at that thing. Thank you.

33
00:01:09,748 --> 00:01:12,007
Feels a little strange wearing
it while Blake's still in jail.

34
00:01:12,083 --> 00:01:13,884
Honey, you don't buy ten
karats to keep it in the box.

35
00:01:13,894 --> 00:01:15,510
Blake would want you to wear it,
trust me.

36
00:01:15,587 --> 00:01:17,855
In fact, we should
celebrate this good news.

37
00:01:17,931 --> 00:01:19,890
It would feel even
stranger to have a party

38
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:21,016
while he's in jail.

39
00:01:21,092 --> 00:01:22,934
Totally agree. But it wouldn't be

40
00:01:23,011 --> 00:01:24,461
strange for me to host

41
00:01:24,463 --> 00:01:27,189
a small, intimate Halloween
hang tomorrow night, would it?

42
00:01:27,199 --> 00:01:28,899
How small and intimate?

43
00:01:28,975 --> 00:01:31,359
- Oh, 300 of my nearest and dearest.
- Yeah.

44
00:01:31,436 --> 00:01:32,870
Count me out.
I'm definitely not partying

45
00:01:32,946 --> 00:01:35,030
- while Blake is in jail.
- Really? Seems like

46
00:01:35,106 --> 00:01:36,290
the perfect time to me.

47
00:01:36,366 --> 00:01:39,418
Oh. Don't go all wicked
stepmother on me now.

48
00:01:39,495 --> 00:01:40,777
Fallon, do you want to help me plan?

49
00:01:40,854 --> 00:01:42,254
'Cause I have a lot of
things to do at the hotel.

50
00:01:42,331 --> 00:01:43,663
No. Not interested.

51
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:44,915
I find it's best to let the gays

52
00:01:44,925 --> 00:01:46,541
handle this holiday on their own.

53
00:01:46,618 --> 00:01:48,919
The only thing I'll be prepping
for are my days of atonement.

54
00:01:48,995 --> 00:01:50,879
- What, you're fasting?
- No, not the Jewish kind.

55
00:01:50,956 --> 00:01:53,840
I'm going to visit Annie Tate
later to apologize again.

56
00:01:53,917 --> 00:01:55,434
Hopefully we won't need
paramedics this time.

57
00:01:55,511 --> 00:01:57,936
And then there's the whole
Culhane situation to deal with.

58
00:01:58,013 --> 00:01:59,128
But first

59
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:01,273
I have to go start community service.

60
00:02:03,468 --> 00:02:05,155
- What?
- Are you really gonna do that?

61
00:02:05,156 --> 00:02:06,356
I thought it was just symbolic.

62
00:02:06,447 --> 00:02:07,938
Don't you have lawyers
to get you out of that?

63
00:02:07,948 --> 00:02:09,898
I don't want to get out of it.
I want to do it.

64
00:02:09,975 --> 00:02:12,734
That's why I confessed.
To pay my debts to society.

65
00:02:12,811 --> 00:02:14,486
Not to have some lawyer
get rid of it for me.

66
00:02:14,497 --> 00:02:16,705
Are you sure you're cut
out for that kind of work?

67
00:02:16,782 --> 00:02:17,906
I'm going to the rec center.

68
00:02:17,983 --> 00:02:19,616
At worst, I'll be teaching some kids

69
00:02:19,627 --> 00:02:20,742
how to swing a tennis racket.

70
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:21,843
ADAM: Ugh... I guess it's the kids

71
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,078
we should be worried about.

72
00:02:23,154 --> 00:02:24,704
Or I could grab my racket right now

73
00:02:24,715 --> 00:02:26,748
and show you my forehand, up close.

74
00:02:26,825 --> 00:02:28,917
Ooh, such a temper.

75
00:02:28,994 --> 00:02:32,045
I see now why Laura Van Kirk
needed a restraining order.

76
00:02:32,122 --> 00:02:33,547
- What?
- Not surprised.

77
00:02:33,623 --> 00:02:36,424
Is that supposed to be a secret?
Oops. My bad.

78
00:02:36,501 --> 00:02:38,927
You know, I also heard
that Laura had to put a bed

79
00:02:39,004 --> 00:02:41,888
in the hospital room,
which means you're not even able

80
00:02:41,965 --> 00:02:43,431
to see Liam. Tough break.

81
00:02:43,508 --> 00:02:44,808
Well, don't worry, okay?

82
00:02:44,884 --> 00:02:46,393
'Cause it's temporary.
And Liam will be discharged

83
00:02:46,469 --> 00:02:48,987
from the hospital soon,
and I will be at his doorstep

84
00:02:49,064 --> 00:02:50,146
the moment he gets home.

85
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:54,150
I'm gonna go. Enjoy your meal.
Or choke on it.

86
00:02:55,401 --> 00:02:58,446
And on that note, I'm already
late for a meeting at the hotel.

87
00:02:58,523 --> 00:02:59,598

I see you're having
entitlement for breakfast.

90
00:03:11,081 --> 00:03:12,127
Didn't take you long to get comfortable

91
00:03:12,203 --> 00:03:13,303
in my father's chair.

92
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:14,796
Don't be jealous.

93
00:03:14,873 --> 00:03:17,891

won't come up for air.

I know. That's why I called you.

There's not a lot I can
do without a signature.

we have nothing to worry about.

For instance,
I start community service today,

- without the communal showers.
- Really?

140

gonna pay your supervisor

to say you did your hours;
I know how you operate.

Why does everybody think
that I can't do this?

The president of the Historical
Alliance is due any minute now,

00:05:53,198 --> 00:05:55,081
and I need to get my charm game on

161
00:05:55,158 --> 00:05:57,625
if I'm going to convince her
to revoke landmark status

162
00:05:57,702 --> 00:06:00,387
- and cancel the media event for the homophobe.

I'm sorry I'm late. I didn't realize

170
00:06:23,228 --> 00:06:25,153
there would be no valet,
and I had to park so far away,

171
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:28,156

because I left my racket in the car.

Uh, Frank?

Isn't the rec center that way?

I would have upped my SPF, but...

183

Look, you need to complete
a certain number of hours

per week to fulfill your service.

Non-completion can result in jail time.

Now, you have two days
to fix this area up

hours for your judge.

283
00:10:46,074 --> 00:10:47,741

you out of the manor?

your problems with her

and I just wanted to
see how she was doing.

300
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:29,824
I mean, the last time I saw her,
she had a raging panic attack,

- No, she's better.

Still panics, but that's mostly about

00:11:58,238 --> 00:11:59,446
I really screwed up.

316
00:11:59,523 --> 00:12:02,023
You were probably pretty
scared that night.

317
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:05,026
You were young. It was an accident.

318
00:12:05,103 --> 00:12:08,696
And... hating you isn't
gonna bring my sister back.

319
00:12:08,773 --> 00:12:12,242
That's definitely a different
reaction than I got from your mother.

320
00:12:12,252 --> 00:12:14,994
(EXHALES SHARPLY) Yeah.

321
00:12:15,071 --> 00:12:17,997
- I, uh, heard about your community service.
- Yes, I'm, uh,

322
00:12:18,074 --> 00:12:20,917
paying my penance in hopes
of putting this in the past.

323
00:12:20,928 --> 00:12:24,087
I see. Well, good luck.

324
00:12:24,097 --> 00:12:27,590
I hope you get the closure you need.

325
00:12:27,601 --> 00:12:29,893
It was nice to see you, Fallon.

326
00:12:31,629 --> 00:12:33,021
You look great, too.

327
00:12:36,693 --> 00:12:39,444
Is this some sort of Halloween prank?

328
00:12:39,521 --> 00:12:41,312
Sam, what the hell
happened to my plaque?

329
00:12:42,612 --> 00:12:44,232
Oh, dear, that's unfortunate.

330
00:12:44,309 --> 00:12:45,450
Unfortunate?

331
00:12:45,527 --> 00:12:47,068
Do you mind telling me what's going on?

332
00:12:47,145 --> 00:12:50,405
Well, it, um, looks like a
clumsy mistake from the painters.

333
00:12:50,481 --> 00:12:52,288
Good help is so hard to find.

334
00:12:52,323 --> 00:12:53,530
A clumsy mistake?

335
00:12:53,565 --> 00:12:55,201
Who are you kidding with this?

336
00:12:55,278 --> 00:12:57,579
I don't have time to get
a new plaque by tomorrow.

337
00:12:57,655 --> 00:13:00,415
I guess this means you'll have
to cancel, huh? Shame.

338
00:13:00,491 --> 00:13:01,875
This isn't gonna stop me.

339
00:13:01,951 --> 00:13:03,526
I'll find a way to reschedule.

340
00:13:03,528 --> 00:13:05,628
And I'll find a way to destroy
every plaque you try putting up.

341
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:07,806
Don't mess with me, Sam.

342
00:13:07,883 --> 00:13:09,591
I don't stop until I get what I want.

343
00:13:09,667 --> 00:13:10,967
Just ask your ex-husband.

344
00:13:10,978 --> 00:13:13,520
Get the hell out of my hotel.

345
00:13:17,675 --> 00:13:18,750
(DOOR CLOSES)

346
00:13:19,522 --> 00:13:21,936
MONICA: You are not gonna believe this.

347
00:13:23,089 --> 00:13:24,564
What's wrong? What happened?

348
00:13:24,641 --> 00:13:26,883
I just had a chat with Cousin
Bobbi down at the police station.

349
00:13:26,885 --> 00:13:29,819
Oh, did she find new
information on Jeff's case?

350
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:31,279
I got her to show me the evidence report

351
00:13:31,356 --> 00:13:32,572
from Jeff's crime scene.

352
00:13:32,649 --> 00:13:34,324
On the DL, obviously.

353
00:13:34,334 --> 00:13:36,117
Adam's cuff link isn't on the list.

354
00:13:36,194 --> 00:13:37,994
- Are you sure?
- I know how to read.

355
00:13:38,005 --> 00:13:40,163
Without that cuff link,
there's nothing connecting Adam

356
00:13:40,173 --> 00:13:41,623
to Jeff's disappearance.

357
00:13:41,699 --> 00:13:42,999
The whole plan blows up.

358
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:44,792
Well, maybe they just
overlooked something.

359
00:13:44,869 --> 00:13:46,169
We can't just give up.

360
00:13:46,179 --> 00:13:47,754
I'm not giving up.

361
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:50,473
I'm gonna find out who
took that evidence.

362
00:13:59,434 --> 00:14:00,934
It's me. Are we good to go?

363
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:02,419
NAOMI: Not exactly.

364
00:14:02,421 --> 00:14:04,646
Do you know anything about
Jeff moving all of his assets

365
00:14:04,722 --> 00:14:06,814
- into a trust account?
- No, and I don't care.

366
00:14:06,891 --> 00:14:09,275
- Just tell me the paperwork is done.
- It's not.

367
00:14:09,352 --> 00:14:11,286
I need the name and tax ID of the trust

368
00:14:11,363 --> 00:14:12,654
to create the power of attorney.

369
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:13,947
Can you get a copy of it?

370
00:14:14,023 --> 00:14:16,449
I don't know where Jeff
kept things like that.

371
00:14:16,526 --> 00:14:17,617
Well, you better figure it out,

372
00:14:17,628 --> 00:14:18,826
because without that information,

373
00:14:18,903 --> 00:14:22,213
there's no POA, there's no money.

374
00:14:24,125 --> 00:14:25,508
(CLATTERS)

375
00:14:29,957 --> 00:14:31,715
Heard about your visit with Father.

376
00:14:31,792 --> 00:14:34,259
(CHUCKLES) Don't be jealous.

377
00:14:34,336 --> 00:14:35,761
It wasn't conjugal.

378
00:14:35,837 --> 00:14:38,096
So, why would you ask him to
throw me out of the manor?

379
00:14:38,173 --> 00:14:39,297
Because I hate you.

380
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:40,974
And thank you for coming to my TED Talk.

381
00:14:40,985 --> 00:14:42,768
- Goodbye.
- You really need to stop blaming me

382
00:14:42,844 --> 00:14:44,378
for everything that
goes wrong in your life.

383
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:47,606
Oh, no, no, no. I am taking
responsibility for my actions

384
00:14:47,683 --> 00:14:49,992
and only blaming you for
things I know you did.

385
00:14:50,069 --> 00:14:51,652
You know nothing because
you have no proof.

386
00:14:51,662 --> 00:14:54,738
Oh, yeah.
That sounds like an innocent person.

387
00:14:54,815 --> 00:14:57,407
You will regret trying to
separate me from Blake.

388
00:14:57,784 --> 00:14:58,784
He named me

389
00:14:58,794 --> 00:15:00,827
- CEO of the winery.
- Oh, yes.

390
00:15:00,838 --> 00:15:02,120
I heard about that.

391
00:15:02,197 --> 00:15:03,672
Good luck with that bathwater.

392
00:15:04,674 --> 00:15:05,841
Why do you think we
drink so much champagne

393
00:15:05,918 --> 00:15:07,343
around here?

394
00:15:07,419 --> 00:15:08,761
The vineyard's the most important asset

395
00:15:08,837 --> 00:15:10,170
that Father has left.

396
00:15:10,181 --> 00:15:11,513
So while I'm working

397
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:13,423
to secure Father's future,

398
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,050
might not be best for
you to come after me.

399
00:15:15,127 --> 00:15:16,760
Or I'll come right back after you.

400
00:15:16,771 --> 00:15:18,971
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

401
00:15:19,619 --> 00:15:21,682
You want to come after me?

402
00:15:21,692 --> 00:15:24,818
Bring it on.

403
00:15:27,439 --> 00:15:28,689
SAM: Why is it so quiet?

404
00:15:29,349 --> 00:15:30,415
Where's the crew?

405
00:15:30,492 --> 00:15:31,817
We can't fall behind.

406
00:15:31,893 --> 00:15:34,203
They just stopped work.
Some sort of a permit problem.

407
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,612
I'm on hold with the city.

408
00:15:35,689 --> 00:15:37,373
- Yes. Yes, I'm still here.
- What...

409
00:15:37,449 --> 00:15:38,624
What kind of permit issue?

410
00:15:38,701 --> 00:15:40,709
The kind where they've all been revoked.

411
00:15:40,786 --> 00:15:43,212
I do have sway in certain circles.

412
00:15:43,289 --> 00:15:44,913
No permits means no working

413
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:47,457
and, therefore, no clumsy mistakes.

414
00:15:47,534 --> 00:15:49,385
- This is unacceptable.
- Well, accept it.

415
00:15:49,461 --> 00:15:51,086
I've had the mayor's
schedule rearranged,

416
00:15:51,163 --> 00:15:53,130
the press rebooked for tomorrow,

417
00:15:53,206 --> 00:15:54,840
and there's a new plaque going up.

418
00:15:54,916 --> 00:15:57,134
VoilÃ . Problem solved.

419
00:15:57,210 --> 00:15:59,011
I always blamed your
horrible personality

420
00:15:59,021 --> 00:16:01,730
on the hormones because
you were pregnant,

421
00:16:01,807 --> 00:16:04,891
but now I realize
that's just who you are.

422
00:16:04,902 --> 00:16:07,060
Well, you better tone down the
bitchiness for the dedication.

423
00:16:07,137 --> 00:16:08,687
Why do you care so
much about this plaque?

424
00:16:08,764 --> 00:16:10,188
History is the backbone of society.

425
00:16:10,265 --> 00:16:11,407
You can't hide the truth,

426
00:16:11,483 --> 00:16:13,817
- no matter how painful it may be.
- Please.

427
00:16:13,894 --> 00:16:15,986
You were literally going
to let your child be raised

428
00:16:16,063 --> 00:16:19,072
by a rich power gay
with a fancy last name,

429
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:20,866
so don't talk to me about truth.

430
00:16:20,942 --> 00:16:22,034
That was different.

431
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:23,744
Oh, was it?

432
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:26,588
Because your lies started a
downward spiral for Steven

433
00:16:26,665 --> 00:16:28,415
that led to our divorce and left me

434
00:16:28,426 --> 00:16:30,334
with a void in my life and no purpose,

435
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:33,754
which is exactly why this hotel
is so important to me right now.

436
00:16:33,764 --> 00:16:36,006
Well, the A.H.A.
is important to me, too.

437
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:37,382
And I'm not gonna let you

438
00:16:37,459 --> 00:16:39,343
or anyone else destroy it.

439
00:16:39,419 --> 00:16:41,219
When people figure out
who this guy really was,

440
00:16:41,296 --> 00:16:42,771
they might boycott.

441
00:16:42,848 --> 00:16:44,931
It could ruin my grand opening

442
00:16:44,942 --> 00:16:47,059
and hurt business for years, Melissa.

443
00:16:47,135 --> 00:16:49,111
Well, it's not my problem. If you

444
00:16:49,188 --> 00:16:51,030
so much as get a fingerprint
on that new plaque,

445
00:16:51,106 --> 00:16:54,116
I'll make sure that your
permits are never approved.

446
00:16:54,193 --> 00:16:56,285
This place will be
nothing but a graveyard

447
00:16:56,362 --> 00:16:57,861
for your money.

448
00:16:57,938 --> 00:17:01,040
Or Steven's money, I guess.

449
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:04,451
(GRUNTS)

450
00:17:04,462 --> 00:17:06,953
I thought I smelled
sulfur and brimstone.

451
00:17:06,964 --> 00:17:09,164
Is she behind the permit situation?

452
00:17:09,241 --> 00:17:11,633
Yes.

453
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:13,418
But if she can use her power for evil,

454
00:17:13,495 --> 00:17:15,304
I can use my money for good.

455
00:17:15,381 --> 00:17:18,090
Tell the crew I'll pay them
double to work without permits.

456
00:17:18,166 --> 00:17:19,424
I'm afraid that won't be possible.

457
00:17:19,501 --> 00:17:21,551
After further review of our finances,

458
00:17:21,628 --> 00:17:24,096
our cash flow is down to a trickle.

459
00:17:24,172 --> 00:17:25,764
I am not gonna have my name associated

460
00:17:25,841 --> 00:17:30,152
with a dead, homophobic
architect/city planner, Anders.

461
00:17:30,229 --> 00:17:31,779
You may not have much of a choice.

462
00:17:32,848 --> 00:17:34,731
You know what?

463
00:17:34,808 --> 00:17:37,317
I do, actually.

464
00:17:37,328 --> 00:17:39,486
I'm selling the hotel.

465
00:17:39,497 --> 00:17:42,206
Find me a buyer. I'm out.

466
00:17:44,668 --> 00:17:47,481
This shade works much
better with my complexion.

467
00:17:47,571 --> 00:17:49,788
No wonder you're handling this
community service thing so well.

468
00:17:49,865 --> 00:17:51,790
Actually, it's harder than I thought,

469
00:17:51,867 --> 00:17:53,509
but that's only because
I came unprepared.

470
00:17:53,585 --> 00:17:56,336
Today, I have a plan:
imported Dutch soil,

471
00:17:56,347 --> 00:17:58,630
a Buddhist monk to bless the Zen garden,

472
00:17:58,707 --> 00:18:00,799
and a crop-maximizing plan

473
00:18:00,876 --> 00:18:03,927
designed by Atlanta's
top landscape architect.

474
00:18:04,004 --> 00:18:05,345
Bringing the one percent to the 99%.

475
00:18:05,356 --> 00:18:07,022
- Heroic.
- If everything goes

476
00:18:07,099 --> 00:18:09,474
as planned,
I should have a version of my garden

477
00:18:09,551 --> 00:18:12,185
done by tonight and
dodge another court date.

478
00:18:12,196 --> 00:18:14,146
Ooh, don't say "court date."

479
00:18:14,222 --> 00:18:15,439
Even with Blake in jail,

480
00:18:15,515 --> 00:18:17,107
I'm a little nervous
coming back in this place.

481
00:18:17,184 --> 00:18:18,193
FALLON: Oh, relax.

482
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:20,110
You're not trespassing. I called you.

483
00:18:20,187 --> 00:18:21,370
And here's why.

484
00:18:22,481 --> 00:18:23,872
Here you go.

485
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:27,951
- What's this?
- Well, it's an upgrade to your portfolio.

486
00:18:28,028 --> 00:18:30,370
It's my shares of the Atlantix.

487
00:18:30,381 --> 00:18:33,331
I want you to know how sorry I am

488
00:18:33,408 --> 00:18:35,125
for my part in unwittingly

489
00:18:35,202 --> 00:18:36,501
helping Blake frame you.

490
00:18:36,512 --> 00:18:38,387
So you're now the majority
owner of the team.

491
00:18:38,464 --> 00:18:39,488
MICHAEL: Wow.

492
00:18:39,565 --> 00:18:41,465
(CHUCKLES): Apology accepted.

493
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:43,300
Jeff would have given you
his shares, too.

494
00:18:43,376 --> 00:18:45,010
He'd be happy you're in charge.

495
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:47,012
Any update?

496
00:18:47,088 --> 00:18:49,306
- I've been praying for your family.
- Nothing yet.

497
00:18:49,382 --> 00:18:50,599
But thanks.

498
00:18:50,675 --> 00:18:52,058
I'll keep on praying.

499
00:18:52,069 --> 00:18:53,185
And I'm sorry

500
00:18:53,261 --> 00:18:55,729
things got so bad between us.

501
00:18:55,739 --> 00:18:57,022
Fresh start?

502
00:18:57,098 --> 00:18:58,907
Fresh start.

503
00:18:59,651 --> 00:19:02,360
Uh, I guess I got a team to run.

504
00:19:02,437 --> 00:19:04,246
I can't thank you enough for this.

505
00:19:04,323 --> 00:19:05,581
It's all a part of my atonement tour.

506
00:19:05,657 --> 00:19:07,282
<i>(LOCK BUZZES)</i>

507
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:09,960
What's this all about?
Where are you taking me?

508
00:19:13,499 --> 00:19:14,873
Cristal. What are you...?

509
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:15,983
Shh.

510
00:19:21,831 --> 00:19:23,215
I reached out to your friend.

511
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:25,358
Warden Aldrich?

512
00:19:25,393 --> 00:19:27,928
Convinced him to grant
us a little alone time.

513
00:19:27,938 --> 00:19:28,939
- (SIGHS)
- In a place

514
00:19:29,005 --> 00:19:30,388
with no guards

515
00:19:30,465 --> 00:19:31,940
and no cameras.

516
00:19:40,725 --> 00:19:42,567
This should help you make
it through the night.

517
00:19:42,644 --> 00:19:44,569
(EXHALES) Oh, you're a genius.

518
00:19:44,646 --> 00:19:46,530
Money still pays for some things.

519
00:19:47,707 --> 00:19:49,324
You can put that away later.

520
00:19:49,401 --> 00:19:51,585
Unless you were planning
to keep those pants on.

521
00:19:56,616 --> 00:19:58,258
- Here you go.
- Appreciate it.

522
00:20:00,019 --> 00:20:01,136
What the...?

523
00:20:01,213 --> 00:20:02,879
Frank! Frank.

524
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:04,506
What the hell happened here?

525
00:20:04,583 --> 00:20:06,800
You tell me, Little Miss Fancy Plants.

526
00:20:06,876 --> 00:20:08,310
No, n-n-no. When I left last night,

527
00:20:08,387 --> 00:20:10,470
my vertical garden
was actually vertical,

528
00:20:10,481 --> 00:20:13,056
not some mangled heap of soggy trash.

529
00:20:13,133 --> 00:20:15,016
- Guess it fell apart.
- Oh, you think?

530
00:20:15,093 --> 00:20:17,308
Leaving the hose running all
night didn't help much either.

531
00:20:17,343 --> 00:20:19,396
Are you sure you closed that gate?
I'm guessing the raccoons got in

532
00:20:19,472 --> 00:20:20,805
- and had their way with the trash bins.
- Okay.

533
00:20:20,883 --> 00:20:22,774
Well, it's not my fault
raccoons are garbage people.

534
00:20:22,851 --> 00:20:24,943
- You're still gonna sign my form, right?
- Sure, yeah.

535
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:27,279
- Soon as you fix everything.
- What, like redo it?

536
00:20:27,355 --> 00:20:29,072
There is no way I can finish this

537
00:20:29,149 --> 00:20:31,283
before it gets dark,
and I need my form signed

538
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:32,668
in the morning for the judge,

539
00:20:32,744 --> 00:20:34,828
- or I could go to jail.
- Sorry.

540
00:20:34,838 --> 00:20:37,631
Don't do the crime if
you can't do the time.

541
00:20:43,814 --> 00:20:44,462
DOMINIQUE: <i>Damn it. I can't</i>

542
00:20:44,539 --> 00:20:45,572
find it anywhere.

543
00:20:45,574 --> 00:20:46,682
NAOMI: Even if it takes a few days,

544
00:20:46,758 --> 00:20:47,966
you'll still get your money.

545
00:20:48,043 --> 00:20:49,175
You don't get it.

546
00:20:49,186 --> 00:20:50,635
Monica is snooping around,

547
00:20:50,712 --> 00:20:52,688
and if she figures out that
that cuff link was missing

548
00:20:52,764 --> 00:20:56,191
before the cops got there,
she'll know I'm to blame. Okay?

549
00:20:56,268 --> 00:20:58,694
We need to get this file before then.

550
00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:00,937
Once I have the money,
the cuff links won't matter.

551
00:21:01,014 --> 00:21:02,480
Try his office.

552
00:21:02,557 --> 00:21:05,025
If you can get me a copy of
the trust tonight, I can file

553
00:21:05,035 --> 00:21:06,318
with the court first
thing in the morning.

554
00:21:06,394 --> 00:21:07,869
- (DOOR CLOSES)
- Oh, I got to go.

555
00:21:07,946 --> 00:21:09,988
- I'll call you later.
- (FOOTFALLS APPROACHING)

556
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:12,866
Monica. You're back.

557
00:21:12,942 --> 00:21:14,159
I've talked to every cop who was

558
00:21:14,235 --> 00:21:15,619
at Jeff's crime scene, except for one.

559
00:21:15,695 --> 00:21:17,662
- And?
- No one saw a cuff link,

560
00:21:17,739 --> 00:21:20,332
but I still need to talk to
the first one on the scene.

561
00:21:20,408 --> 00:21:22,334
- That should give me a definitive answer.
- Calm down.

562
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:23,627
Let me fix you a drink.

563
00:21:23,703 --> 00:21:27,055
All right? You've got a lot going on.

564
00:21:27,132 --> 00:21:31,059
You've been going nonstop.
I'm worried about you.

565
00:21:31,136 --> 00:21:32,969
You look exhausted.

566
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:34,804
MONICA: Of course I'm tired,

567
00:21:34,881 --> 00:21:36,565
but I still have work to do.

568
00:21:36,642 --> 00:21:40,569
But you have to take care
of yourself, too.

569
00:21:40,646 --> 00:21:42,779
And haven't you done enough for today?

570
00:21:45,984 --> 00:21:47,275
I guess one drink couldn't hurt.

571
00:21:47,352 --> 00:21:48,568
It will

572
00:21:48,579 --> 00:21:49,986
definitely help,

573
00:21:50,063 --> 00:21:51,997
quite a lot.

574
00:21:58,358 --> 00:21:59,866
- FALLON: Happy Halloween, Tony!
- (GASPS)

575
00:21:59,943 --> 00:22:01,585
Maybe, uh, drop the knife for a sec.

576
00:22:01,661 --> 00:22:03,912
I come bearing gifts of opportunity

577
00:22:03,988 --> 00:22:05,246
and cash.

578
00:22:05,323 --> 00:22:07,499
I have a tiny little
favor to ask that pays big

579
00:22:07,509 --> 00:22:09,167
should you choose to accept it.

580
00:22:09,178 --> 00:22:11,127
I'm still pretty traumatized

581
00:22:11,204 --> 00:22:13,254
from the favors your mom foisted on me.

582
00:22:13,331 --> 00:22:15,340
You did favors for my...?

583
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:16,633
I don't want to know.

584
00:22:16,709 --> 00:22:19,677
I just need you to work
your green thumb magic

585
00:22:19,688 --> 00:22:21,471
on my community garden.

586
00:22:21,548 --> 00:22:24,349
It was tragically destroyed by animals,
and it needs

587
00:22:24,359 --> 00:22:25,975
some serious TLC tonight.

588
00:22:26,052 --> 00:22:29,854
Sure, b-but as long as I
get to trick-or-treat first.

589
00:22:29,865 --> 00:22:31,147
Aren't you a little old for that?

590
00:22:31,224 --> 00:22:32,440
With my kids.

591
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:34,609
Another piece of the puzzle.
No, that's fine.

592
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:36,111
You can't go there till late anyway

593
00:22:36,187 --> 00:22:38,988
because your involvement
in this must be top secret.

594
00:22:39,065 --> 00:22:40,782
Okay? No one can see you.

595
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:43,451
Undercover landscaping mission?

596
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:45,337
Your whole life has
been leading up to this.

597
00:22:57,417 --> 00:23:01,394
The moment this is over,
the cash better hit my account.

Secure left, secure right.

603
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:22,207
10-53 in 14D. Inmate Carrington is down.

604
00:23:30,592 --> 00:23:31,683
Can I help you?

605
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:35,095
Oh. You scared me.

606
00:23:35,172 --> 00:23:37,213
I didn't know anyone else was here.

607
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:38,431
Well, neither did I.

608
00:23:38,508 --> 00:23:41,643
- I'm...
- Michael Culhane. I know.

609
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,228
Jeff has told me all about you.

610
00:23:43,305 --> 00:23:46,439
Although he didn't tell me
you look like this. I'm...

611
00:23:46,516 --> 00:23:49,392
Dominique Deveraux.
Looks like our reputations precede us.

612
00:23:51,515 --> 00:23:52,779
So, what are you doing in here?

613
00:23:52,856 --> 00:23:54,948
Well, grasping at straws.

614
00:23:55,025 --> 00:23:56,608
Jeff has been missing for a few weeks,

615
00:23:56,618 --> 00:23:58,735
and the police have no leads,

616
00:23:58,811 --> 00:24:00,403
so I thought they may
have missed something

617
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,906
and I was retracing all of his steps.

618
00:24:02,982 --> 00:24:06,242
- Find anything helpful?
- Sadly, just another dead end.

619
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:09,871
I won't take up any more of your time.

620
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:12,174
Sorry to bother you.

621

- MICHAEL (OVER PHONE): Yeah.

625
00:24:47,502 --> 00:24:49,369
Listen, I'm here at the Atlantix office,

626
00:24:49,379 --> 00:24:51,120
and I just ran into your mom.

627
00:24:51,197 --> 00:24:53,081
- Wait, hold on. My mother?
- She said she was searching

628
00:24:53,157 --> 00:24:55,842
for clues on Jeff's whereabouts,
but it turns out

629
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:57,093
she pulled up information

630
00:24:57,170 --> 00:24:59,587
on some kind of financial trust he had.

631
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:01,130
A trust?

632
00:25:01,207 --> 00:25:02,632
Yeah, I'm not sure what it's about.

633
00:25:02,709 --> 00:25:04,008

Well, luckily, I'm rested enough to go

658

00:37:59,996 --> 00:38:01,771
Please,
just give me a chance to explain.

960
00:38:01,847 --> 00:38:03,055
JEFF: What's to explain?

961
00:38:03,132 --> 00:38:04,556
You were snooping around my trust.

962
00:38:04,567 --> 00:38:06,275
You looking to cash in somehow?

963
00:38:06,352 --> 00:38:07,518
I would never do that.

964
00:38:07,594 --> 00:38:09,770
But you would drug your own daughter?

965
00:38:09,781 --> 00:38:11,614
I... You were distraught.

966
00:38:12,291 --> 00:38:14,024
I gave you one of my sleeping pills

967
00:38:14,101 --> 00:38:16,456
because you were exhausted,
you needed to rest.

968
00:38:16,491 --> 00:38:17,620
How maternal of you.

969
00:38:17,697 --> 00:38:19,372
Don't worry.
I still spoke to the last cop

970
00:38:19,448 --> 00:38:21,031
at Jeff's crime scene.

971
00:38:21,108 --> 00:38:22,458
No one saw a cuff link.

972
00:38:23,222 --> 00:38:25,761
Seems it was missing before
the police even showed up.

973
00:38:25,796 --> 00:38:26,995
JEFF: Which means you took it.

974
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:28,214
After all, you're the only other person

975
00:38:28,290 --> 00:38:29,299
who knew it was there.

976
00:38:29,366 --> 00:38:30,624
That's ridiculous. I would never...

977
00:38:30,701 --> 00:38:32,251
You know what? Just save it, all right?

978
00:38:32,327 --> 00:38:33,636
The second Moni called me,

979
00:38:33,713 --> 00:38:35,462
I knew you were up to
your old tricks again.

980
00:38:35,473 --> 00:38:38,716
And I'm not having it.
I want you out now.

981
00:38:40,294 --> 00:38:41,368
MONICA: Uh-uh.

982
00:38:43,147 --> 00:38:46,315
You may have given up on me, but...

983
00:38:46,392 --> 00:38:50,986
I will never give up on the both of you.

984
00:38:51,063 --> 00:38:53,614
That's a promise.

985
00:38:59,071 --> 00:39:01,038
♪ ♪

986
00:39:04,526 --> 00:39:06,460
(GROANS)

987
00:39:08,989 --> 00:39:10,289
Where do you think you're going?

988
00:39:10,365 --> 00:39:12,842
Ooh. (CHUCKLES)

989
00:39:12,918 --> 00:39:14,626
Work, baby. Mm.

990
00:39:14,703 --> 00:39:16,587
Yeah, I may not be able
to leave the manor

991
00:39:16,663 --> 00:39:17,921
because of this thing,
but I have to call

992
00:39:17,998 --> 00:39:19,673
our wine distributors
and smooth things over

993
00:39:19,684 --> 00:39:22,342
after Adam's meltdown last night.

994
00:39:22,353 --> 00:39:24,344
No need.

995
00:39:24,355 --> 00:39:25,679
I handled it.

996
00:39:26,923 --> 00:39:27,957
In fact,

997
00:39:28,033 --> 00:39:29,767
I even convinced Mr. Han

998
00:39:29,843 --> 00:39:32,936
to carry our wines in all
his Shanghai properties.

999
00:39:33,013 --> 00:39:34,019
How'd you do that?

1000
00:39:34,056 --> 00:39:35,773
I can be very persuasive.

1001
00:39:35,849 --> 00:39:37,483
I am impressed.

1002
00:39:37,493 --> 00:39:39,869
I had no idea you were such a shark.

1003
00:39:39,945 --> 00:39:42,446
And I can do more if given the chance.

1004
00:39:42,523 --> 00:39:43,873
What'd you have in mind?

1005
00:39:44,249 --> 00:39:45,365
The winery.

1006
00:39:45,442 --> 00:39:48,368
I want the same level
of authority as Adam.

1007
00:39:48,379 --> 00:39:50,364
- Hmm.
- As your wife,

1008
00:39:50,399 --> 00:39:52,715
I should have a say in
the family business.

1009
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:57,219
Give me power, and I promise

1010
00:39:57,296 --> 00:39:59,990
our dynasty will flourish.

1011
00:40:00,025 --> 00:40:01,245
Well, then,

1012
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:05,144
congrats on your promotion,
Mrs. Carrington.

1013
00:40:07,732 --> 00:40:09,014
MELISSA: <i>And even though he was</i>

1014
00:40:09,091 --> 00:40:11,892
a controversial man, today we are here

1015
00:40:11,903 --> 00:40:14,394
to celebrate one of his
positive contributions

1016
00:40:14,405 --> 00:40:16,230
to this great city.

1017
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:17,731
In addition,

1018
00:40:17,742 --> 00:40:19,858
we at the Atlanta Historic Alliance

1019
00:40:19,935 --> 00:40:23,120
are adding this hotel
to our Must-Visit list.

1020
00:40:23,197 --> 00:40:25,581
So we encourage you all to book a room

1021
00:40:25,658 --> 00:40:27,282
at this marvelous property.

1022
00:40:27,293 --> 00:40:29,251
- (LAUGHS)
- (APPLAUSE)

1023
00:40:29,328 --> 00:40:30,652
Thank you so much.

1024
00:40:30,730 --> 00:40:33,163
I guess we should rename
it the Homophobic Stairway.

1025
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:35,290
It's a smart business decision.

1026
00:40:35,367 --> 00:40:38,001
And now that our permits
have been approved again,

1027
00:40:38,078 --> 00:40:39,503
we can get back on track.

1028
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:42,548
This is a good thing, Sam, you'll see.

1029
00:40:42,624 --> 00:40:43,924
Maybe.

1030
00:40:43,935 --> 00:40:45,676
But right now all I see is a sacrifice

1031
00:40:45,752 --> 00:40:48,270
I'm not sure I can live with.

1032
00:40:48,347 --> 00:40:50,314
(SIGHS)

1033
00:40:52,801 --> 00:40:54,393
(EXHALES)

1034
00:40:54,469 --> 00:40:55,535
ADAM: Wow.

1035
00:40:55,546 --> 00:40:57,154
(CHUCKLES)

1036
00:40:57,231 --> 00:40:58,939
Looks like someone had quite a night.

1037
00:40:58,950 --> 00:41:01,283
You can wipe that gleeful
look off your face

1038
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:03,277
because I finished my garden.

1039
00:41:03,287 --> 00:41:05,153
Yeah. So your request
of seeing me in jail

1040
00:41:05,164 --> 00:41:06,372
has been denied.

1041
00:41:06,448 --> 00:41:07,489
Well, that's not why I'm smiling.

1042
00:41:07,566 --> 00:41:08,615
I spoke to Laura.

1043
00:41:09,752 --> 00:41:11,577
Liam's been discharged
from the hospital.

1044
00:41:11,653 --> 00:41:12,777
He has?

1045
00:41:12,855 --> 00:41:14,746
However, I did feel compelled to suggest

1046
00:41:14,823 --> 00:41:17,749
that she take him back to her place.

1047
00:41:17,826 --> 00:41:20,419
You know, so she can care for him 24-7.

1048
00:41:20,495 --> 00:41:21,594
You did what?

1049
00:41:21,596 --> 00:41:23,013
Oh, oh, oh. That's-that's right.

1050
00:41:23,090 --> 00:41:27,351
Um, if he's with her,
you can't be with him.

1051
00:41:27,428 --> 00:41:29,344
Just a little payback for
last night's party foul.

1052
00:41:29,421 --> 00:41:31,230
That's not gonna stop me.

1053
00:41:31,307 --> 00:41:32,815
Mark my words,

1054
00:41:32,892 --> 00:41:35,058
I will find a way to see Liam.

1055
00:41:35,135 --> 00:41:36,310
Mm. And did I also mention

1056
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:37,603
that Laura said that wedding bells

1057
00:41:37,679 --> 00:41:40,155
weren't too far off for Liam and Ashley?

1058
00:41:40,232 --> 00:41:43,367
So you better find a way quickly.

1059
00:41:47,732 --> 00:41:49,874
