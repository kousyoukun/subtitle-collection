00:06:46,341 --> 00:06:48,708
I think we should repeat
all the things we just did

177
00:06:48,776 --> 00:06:50,843
- at least once a day.
- Normally, I would agree.

178
00:06:50,912 --> 00:06:53,712
But... (EXHALES)
I need to focus on being good.

179
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:56,615
Trust me. You're doing plenty good.

180
00:06:56,683 --> 00:06:59,017
That surgery should have killed me.

181
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:01,487
But for some reason, I was spared.

182
00:07:01,555 --> 00:07:05,124
So, this is a chance
for me to do better.

183
00:07:05,192 --> 00:07:07,359
Now I want to pay it back.

184
00:07:08,173 --> 00:07:10,763
Or pay it forward.
Point is, I-I want to pay it.

185
00:07:10,789 --> 00:07:13,532
So... unlike you.

186
00:07:13,601 --> 00:07:15,534
It's like I just had sex with St. Adam,

187
00:07:15,603 --> 00:07:17,569
which is really kind of a turn-on.

188
00:07:18,053 --> 00:07:18,903
WOMAN: Dr. Carrington.

189
00:07:18,972 --> 00:07:21,740
Dr. Bailey needs to see
you upstairs immediately.

190
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:23,375
What about? This?

191
00:07:23,444 --> 00:07:24,576
Oh, she's not a patient.

192
00:07:24,645 --> 00:07:26,878
Something about stolen medication?

193
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:32,617
♪ ♪

194
00:07:35,008 --> 00:07:37,944
Don't bother denying it,
because there were eyewitnesses.

195
00:07:38,428 --> 00:07:40,514
Supplies, meds, anything else you stole?

196
00:07:40,527 --> 00:07:43,149
Dr. Bailey,
eyewitnesses are notoriously unreliable.

197
00:07:43,217 --> 00:07:44,283
And security cam footage.

198
00:07:44,352 --> 00:07:46,052
Less unreliable.

199
00:07:47,669 --> 00:07:48,987
Do you have anything
to say for yourself?

200
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:53,291
There's a shelter down the street.
It was out of supplies...

201
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,461
Stop. That shelter doesn't need
any help, Dr. Carrington.

202
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:57,763
This is disappointing.

203
00:07:57,831 --> 00:07:59,097
I don't want to have to
recommend to the board

204
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:00,715
- that you be fired, but...
- Fired?

205
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,167
- What about a warning?
- Warnings

206
00:08:02,235 --> 00:08:04,703
are for things like having
sex in the supply closet.

207
00:08:04,772 --> 00:08:06,438
How many cameras are
there in this place?

208
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:10,275
I won't take pleasure
in punishing you, Doctor.

209
00:08:10,343 --> 00:08:13,645
Well... at least not in this way.

210
00:08:13,714 --> 00:08:15,948
So, it'll be sad to see you go.

211
00:08:16,016 --> 00:08:17,649
Mm-hmm. Right.

212
00:08:17,718 --> 00:08:19,551
You've had it out for me
ever since I turned down

213
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:21,553
your advances my first week on the job.

214
00:08:21,622 --> 00:08:22,888
I resent that accusation.

215
00:08:26,397 --> 00:08:28,425
Maybe we can work something out.

216
00:08:35,635 --> 00:08:37,568
Guess you'll want this, then.

217
00:08:38,567 --> 00:08:41,171
You can keep it until an
official decision is made.

218
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,040
I'll see you tomorrow night at the gala.

219
00:08:43,963 --> 00:08:47,211
You can plead your case when
you give me a tour of the manor.

220
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:51,882
I'm sure it has a lot of empty
rooms and... dark corners.

221
00:08:53,319 --> 00:08:54,885
(DOOR OPENS)

222
00:09:00,926 --> 00:09:03,860
How'd your meeting go?
Word travels fast.

223
00:09:03,929 --> 00:09:05,996
You sure have a way of making enemies.

224
00:09:09,768 --> 00:09:12,169
So, how can I help you, Ms. Carrington?

225
00:09:12,238 --> 00:09:15,339
Actually, <i>I</i> can help you, Brooke.

226
00:09:15,407 --> 00:09:17,841
Help you with a big commission.

227
00:09:17,909 --> 00:09:21,054
My fiancé is Kelly and
Donna's number one fan.

228
00:09:21,089 --> 00:09:23,551
So I would like to hire
them to play at my wedding,

229
00:09:23,586 --> 00:09:24,448
as a surprise for him.

230
00:09:24,517 --> 00:09:26,583
Because, you know,
what's a better wedding gift than that?

231
00:09:26,652 --> 00:09:30,353
Probably nothing. But I'm afraid
you need to keep shopping.

232
00:09:30,421 --> 00:09:31,855
Shrewd negotiating. I like it.

233
00:09:31,923 --> 00:09:36,059
Uh, I will also cover all
travel expenses for them

234
00:09:36,128 --> 00:09:37,926
and their entourage.

235
00:09:37,961 --> 00:09:39,029
And if they don't have an entourage,

236
00:09:39,097 --> 00:09:42,532
which is sad, I'll buy them one.
There you go.

237
00:09:43,601 --> 00:09:45,935
Well, I wish it was only about money,

238
00:09:46,004 --> 00:09:48,138
especially after seeing this.

239
00:09:48,206 --> 00:09:49,973
But the ladies don't tour anymore.

240
00:09:50,042 --> 00:09:51,708
They just record.

241
00:09:51,777 --> 00:09:53,687
They're wealthy and only play events

242
00:09:53,722 --> 00:09:54,895
that are meaningful to them.

243
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:56,980
I am so sick of meaningful.

244
00:09:57,049 --> 00:09:58,715
I know. But they love charity.

245
00:09:58,784 --> 00:10:00,316
Elephants, orphans, veterans.

246
00:10:00,385 --> 00:10:03,219
Well, if I told them
how much<i> I</i> love charity,

247
00:10:03,288 --> 00:10:06,055
- would that maybe help my chances?
- It might.

248
00:10:06,123 --> 00:10:08,257
They just played an
event for their sorority,

249
00:10:08,326 --> 00:10:10,125
Lambda Lambda Nu, because

250
00:10:10,195 --> 00:10:12,127
all the proceeds went
to feed the homeless.

251
00:10:12,197 --> 00:10:14,063
Lambda Lambda<i> No Way...</i>

252
00:10:14,131 --> 00:10:16,332
I mean...
Oh, my God, are you kidding me?

253
00:10:16,401 --> 00:10:17,633
That is<i> my</i> sorority.

254
00:10:17,702 --> 00:10:20,236
Maybe I should give my sisters a tour

255
00:10:20,305 --> 00:10:23,406
of the revamped physical therapy clinic
they'll be playing for.

256
00:10:23,474 --> 00:10:25,007
Well, I'm sure that would
go a long way with them.

257
00:10:25,076 --> 00:10:27,677
Fantastic.
I'm gonna leave that right there.

258
00:10:27,745 --> 00:10:30,846
Will you please tell my
fellow Lambda Lambda Nus

259
00:10:30,915 --> 00:10:33,683
- how excited I am to meet them?
- Yeah.

260
00:10:33,751 --> 00:10:36,819
'Cause you know,
there's no bond quite like sisterhood.

261
00:10:36,887 --> 00:10:38,053
I'm not telling them that.

262
00:10:39,323 --> 00:10:42,257
No. No.

263
00:10:43,075 --> 00:10:44,126
Moved.

264
00:10:44,677 --> 00:10:45,928
Ew, no.

265
00:10:46,597 --> 00:10:49,297
Swiping up. New dating app?

266
00:10:49,366 --> 00:10:51,299
I'm actually just trying to find
someone to go to Taylor Swift

267
00:10:51,368 --> 00:10:53,969
with me tonight,
but no one's front row material.

268
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:56,504
That's the nice thing
about being married.

269
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:58,340
You have a plus-one built right in.

270
00:10:58,408 --> 00:11:00,976
Yeah, I guess so.

271
00:11:01,245 --> 00:11:03,645
Well, where's the, uh,
redhead from down under?

272
00:11:03,713 --> 00:11:04,879
She's mad at me.

273
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:07,515
Actually, do you want to go?

274
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:08,683
Oh, God, no.

275
00:11:08,752 --> 00:11:10,217
I'm just gonna have a chill dinner here

276
00:11:10,286 --> 00:11:11,552
and then go to bed early.

277
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:13,187
Totally get it. Though for someone

278
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:15,722
that just had liver surgery,
you look great.

279
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:17,325
Yeah, I feel great. I mean, you know,

280
00:11:17,393 --> 00:11:19,927
if-if you want,
we could get a bite to eat...

281
00:11:19,996 --> 00:11:23,397
Love to. I mean,
we-we never really get to hang out,

282
00:11:23,466 --> 00:11:24,731
and this is the perfect opportunity

283
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:29,170
for us to rekindle our... acquaintance.

284
00:11:30,473 --> 00:11:32,673
JENNINGS: Finally. I've been waiting.

285
00:11:32,741 --> 00:11:34,741
The dance instructor is
gonna be here any minute.

286
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:36,110
I didn't miss anything?

287
00:11:36,179 --> 00:11:37,945
I wanted to talk to
you before he got here.

288
00:11:38,014 --> 00:11:41,415
I-I apologize,
but I had to stop on my way home

289
00:11:41,484 --> 00:11:43,351
to pick up this.

290
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:46,887
Wow.

291
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:49,422
Blake, this isn't something
you just "pick up."

292
00:11:49,492 --> 00:11:51,959
Well, nothing is too good for my wife.

293
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:57,263
So...

294
00:11:57,332 --> 00:12:00,467
if there's something
you want to talk about,

295
00:12:00,536 --> 00:12:03,169
you'll look like a couple
million bucks doing it.

296
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:06,540
- Hmm?
- (PHONE RINGING)

297
00:12:06,609 --> 00:12:09,009
- I...
- Wait now, okay? Hold that thought.

298
00:12:11,046 --> 00:12:13,580
This will just take a minute. Hopefully.

299
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:14,882
What's the latest over there?

300
00:12:17,152 --> 00:12:19,119
(SIGHS) You're not the dance instructor.

301
00:12:19,187 --> 00:12:22,722
And you're not Ginger Rogers.
I'm glad we got that straight.

302
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:24,124
(LAUGHS): Ooh.

303
00:12:24,192 --> 00:12:26,559
(GASPS) Nice bling.

304
00:12:26,628 --> 00:12:29,496
I see someone's been putting
her allowance to good use.

305
00:12:29,564 --> 00:12:30,997
It was a present from your father.

306
00:12:31,066 --> 00:12:33,733
Oh, God. Well, then, I am sorry.

307
00:12:33,801 --> 00:12:35,935
For what? Having a generous husband?

308
00:12:36,004 --> 00:12:38,571
Right. You have a safe
in your closet filled

309
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,174
with enough diamonds to buy an island,
but my father

310
00:12:41,243 --> 00:12:44,610
just happened to pick up this
seven-figure treat just because.

311
00:12:44,679 --> 00:12:47,247
No. He obviously did something wrong.

312
00:12:47,315 --> 00:12:49,149
Isn't that kind of a cliché?

313
00:12:49,217 --> 00:12:50,483
Well, so is getting married three times,

314
00:12:50,552 --> 00:12:52,285
but he nailed that one, too.

315
00:12:52,354 --> 00:12:54,120
You mind if I just...?

316
00:12:54,189 --> 00:12:55,988
Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.

317
00:12:56,057 --> 00:13:00,325
That is the "Daddy did something very,
very bad" gift.

00:13:00,394 --> 00:13:03,463
Mm-hmm. I've seen it before.
Alexis had a few.

319
00:13:03,498 --> 00:13:05,264
Even fake Cristal got one.

320
00:13:05,332 --> 00:13:07,832
He's obviously hiding something.

321
00:13:07,901 --> 00:13:09,734
Anyway, have a great lesson.

BLAKE: <i>Laura Van Kirk screwed me.</i>

323
00:13:15,076 --> 00:13:17,142
I just found out that
Carrington Atlantic oil tankers

324
00:13:17,211 --> 00:13:19,611
are being held up in
Moldavian shipping lanes.

325
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,879
Held up by what exactly?

326
00:13:20,948 --> 00:13:23,949
The government wants to nationalize oil,

327
00:13:24,017 --> 00:13:26,151
and get rid of C.A.'s presence
there once and for all.

328
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:28,820
So the C.A. tankers reloaded their oil,
took off.

329
00:13:28,889 --> 00:13:31,456
But the king won't allow them
outside Moldavian waters?

330
00:13:31,524 --> 00:13:35,293
Exactly, and that's when Laura
decides to sell me the company.

331
00:13:35,361 --> 00:13:38,901
$500 million worth of oil could be lost.

332
00:13:38,936 --> 00:13:40,231
Well, I'm not just
gonna give it to them.

333
00:13:41,215 --> 00:13:43,468
Clear my schedule. Fuel up the jet.

334
00:13:43,536 --> 00:13:45,770
We're going to Moldavia tomorrow.

335
00:13:49,886 --> 00:13:52,829
Where's the instructor?
Let's get this over with.

336
00:13:52,898 --> 00:13:55,732
I sent him home. We can practice.

337
00:13:56,714 --> 00:13:58,902
Though you don't seem to be in
the best frame of mind for that.

- Mm-hmm.

00:14:05,577 --> 00:14:07,910
Why did you buy me this necklace?

341
00:14:07,979 --> 00:14:10,079
I told you.
I haven't been the greatest husband

342

and I want to get you something nice.

343
00:14:11,949 --> 00:14:13,182
Is there a problem?

344
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:16,017
No, it just caught me by surprise.

345
00:14:16,052 --> 00:14:17,286
It's so extravagant.

the only thing I have to apologize for

Cristal saw me afterwards,

but you said we were too young.

524
00:22:13,944 --> 00:22:16,311
That we owed it to ourselves
not to be tied down.

525
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:18,547
Mm. Nice line, player.

526
00:22:18,616 --> 00:22:20,115
Oh, well, you know I was right.

527
00:22:20,893 --> 00:22:22,551
And it was fun while it lasted.

Yeah, timing never seems
to work out for us.

00:22:30,027 --> 00:22:31,192
SAM: Oh, timing is overrated.

532
00:22:31,261 --> 00:22:33,896
Trust me,
I dated a married guy before and,

533
00:22:33,964 --> 00:22:37,460
well, it didn't work out,
but maybe it will for you.

You're married?

- About five months.
- No ring.

00:22:42,071 --> 00:22:44,572
I, uh, guess
I'm just not that used to it.

00:22:44,641 --> 00:22:46,841
None of us are, really.

539
00:22:47,834 --> 00:22:48,976
Okay, so, uh,

540
00:22:49,045 --> 00:22:52,146
I will see you at the gala tonight.

he's still getting ready.
He can be a little vain.

Oh, thanks for the news flash.

547

But I see you are still
wearing the necklace,

548
00:23:20,108 --> 00:23:23,018
which I assume means you talked
and straightened everything out.

Unless you chose to ignore it

Would you mind if I

I know how much trouble it

But you're my expert on Greek life,

the Lambda Lambda Nu secret handshake.

574
00:24:09,223 --> 00:24:11,056
It's impossible. You have to
be double-jointed or something.

575
00:24:11,125 --> 00:24:12,290
I watched the video online,

576
00:24:12,359 --> 00:24:13,659
but they don't show you the whole shake.

577
00:24:13,728 --> 00:24:15,394
So I'm hoping you can teach me the rest.

578
00:24:15,462 --> 00:24:17,229
Well, I can't help you
because I don't know it.

579
00:24:17,297 --> 00:24:18,597
That's why they call it a
"secret" handshake.

All this for a wedding band?

They are not a wedding band.

00:24:24,871 --> 00:24:27,772
The only way he'd be happier
is if Starship played for us.

00:24:27,841 --> 00:24:28,842
He likes Starship?

586
00:24:28,909 --> 00:24:30,008
I know. It's weird.

587
00:24:30,077 --> 00:24:32,444
But anyway,
if I can't get Kelly and Donna,

588
00:24:32,513 --> 00:24:34,079
then I am back to square one.

589
00:24:34,148 --> 00:24:35,580
So what? It's just a present.

590
00:24:35,649 --> 00:24:37,149
You really don't understand.

591
00:24:37,217 --> 00:24:40,352
If this fails,
the universe is telling me

592
00:24:40,421 --> 00:24:42,020
that we do not belong together.

593
00:24:42,089 --> 00:24:43,488
Well, at least you're not overreacting.

594
00:24:43,557 --> 00:24:45,357
Well, I guess we can't all
have the perfect relationship,

595
00:24:45,426 --> 00:24:46,591

596
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:48,293
I don't want to talk about that.

597
00:24:48,362 --> 00:24:50,162
Didn't these women already
agree to play at your wedding?

598
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:53,765
Sort of, but they won't if
they find out the truth.

599
00:24:53,833 --> 00:24:56,201
Which is why I need to
master that secret handshake

600
00:24:56,270 --> 00:24:57,969
and work on my speech

601
00:24:58,038 --> 00:24:59,804
on how I started this program.

00:24:59,873 --> 00:25:03,274
But you didn't start th...

You'll never get away with this.

604
00:25:09,115 --> 00:25:10,214
Where are you going?

605
00:25:10,283 --> 00:25:11,849
Why aren't you dressed?

00:25:11,918 --> 00:25:13,517
Honey, there's a crisis in Moldavia

607
00:25:13,587 --> 00:25:14,886
that needs my immediate attention.

608
00:25:14,955 --> 00:25:17,021
- A crisis. Really?
- It's serious.

609
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:18,222
I'm leaving now.

610
00:25:18,291 --> 00:25:20,291
Oh. And are you going alone?

611
00:25:20,359 --> 00:25:21,693
No. Anders is going with me.

612
00:25:21,761 --> 00:25:24,062
What am I supposed to tell people?

613
00:25:24,130 --> 00:25:26,064
No one will even notice that I'm gone.

614
00:25:26,132 --> 00:25:28,199
Trust me, all eyes are gonna be on you.

615
00:25:28,267 --> 00:25:29,467
What about our dance?

616
00:25:29,535 --> 00:25:31,669
Oh, honey,

617
00:25:31,738 --> 00:25:33,237
you're the love of my life.

618
00:25:33,306 --> 00:25:35,306
My company's in trouble.

619
00:25:35,374 --> 00:25:37,575
If I stay and do nothing,
it'll be fatal.

620
00:25:37,643 --> 00:25:40,578
Our marriage is in trouble.

621
00:25:40,646 --> 00:25:42,679
But apparently that's a
risk you're willing to take.

622
00:25:42,748 --> 00:25:45,849
I don't have a choice.
This is my legacy.

623
00:25:45,918 --> 00:25:48,852
I'll be back as soon as I can
and I will make it up to you.

624
00:25:49,487 --> 00:25:50,487
No, thanks.

625
00:25:53,959 --> 00:25:56,893
Dr. Bailey, you strike me
as a chardonnay drinker.

Brassy, bold.

628
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:02,268
Well, I do know what I like,
and you clean up well.

629
00:26:02,303 --> 00:26:03,700
Thank you.

630
00:26:03,769 --> 00:26:05,536
I was hoping that we could revisit

631
00:26:05,605 --> 00:26:07,538
the discipline that you're

632
00:26:07,607 --> 00:26:09,607
bringing against me to the board.

633
00:26:09,675 --> 00:26:11,542
You mean the discipline
that you brought on yourself

634
00:26:11,611 --> 00:26:12,909
- by stealing?
- Right.

635
00:26:12,978 --> 00:26:14,544
It was for a worthy cause.

636
00:26:14,613 --> 00:26:15,846
If I could just explain myself...

637
00:26:15,914 --> 00:26:18,348
Save it. It's not about why you did it.

638
00:26:18,416 --> 00:26:20,117
It's about what you did, and now,

639
00:26:20,185 --> 00:26:22,953
it's about who you need.

640
00:26:24,657 --> 00:26:28,591
I'm open to working out
an alternative punishment.

641
00:26:28,661 --> 00:26:31,294
I have a soft spot for
pale men in tuxedos.

642
00:26:34,933 --> 00:26:36,933
You're an incredibly beautiful woman,

643
00:26:37,002 --> 00:26:41,304
and, um, I'm very tempted.

644
00:26:41,373 --> 00:26:43,674
But I'm not gonna give
in to temptation tonight.

645
00:26:47,302 --> 00:26:49,011
Wow, nice dress.

662
00:27:25,982 --> 00:27:28,183
I guess Cristal's in the ladies' room.

663
00:27:28,251 --> 00:27:31,519
Luckily, I have written
some words of my own.

664
00:27:31,588 --> 00:27:35,656
We saw a need in our community
and answered the call.

665
00:27:35,726 --> 00:27:37,325
The new physical therapy clinic

666
00:27:37,393 --> 00:27:40,327
will provide hope and
relief for veterans.

667
00:27:40,395 --> 00:27:42,162
It will be a refuge for them,

668
00:27:42,231 --> 00:27:44,497
and hopefully an
inspiration to everyone.

When I first mentioned
this idea to my husband...

- to... to my<i> father,</i> my father,

philanthropy is not a choice,

675
00:28:03,619 --> 00:28:06,220
but a way of life, and he is so right.

676
00:28:06,288 --> 00:28:09,156
That's one of the things that
made me fall in love with him.

677
00:28:09,225 --> 00:28:11,358
And by "him," I mean this project.

678
00:28:11,426 --> 00:28:14,160
So, you know what,
that's enough about me.

679
00:28:14,229 --> 00:28:16,295
Now, I think you would
rather hear from the people

680
00:28:16,364 --> 00:28:18,164
you came here to see in the first place.

681
00:28:18,233 --> 00:28:20,900
So without further ado,
Kelly and Donna, get on up here.

- (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

683
00:28:23,238 --> 00:28:25,071
Uh, before Kelly and I do a set,

684
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:28,141
- we always sing the Lambda Lambda Nu chant
- Always.

685
00:28:28,209 --> 00:28:30,977
for good luck.
And tonight, we are lucky enough

686
00:28:31,045 --> 00:28:35,010
to have a fellow sister
with us to do that.

687
00:28:35,045 --> 00:28:37,049
Do you mind?
We're gonna post it to our social

688
00:28:37,118 --> 00:28:39,185
- so every chapter can see it.
- You know what, though,

689
00:28:39,254 --> 00:28:41,187
I'm much more comfortable
with the handshake,

690
00:28:41,256 --> 00:28:42,655
- so let's just do the handshake.
- No.

that part of the reason I married Alexis

She's still going to the board.

I did everything I
could to convince her,

like it was a disaster,

Not sure if "entertaining"
is the right word,

I was embarrassed for you.

is that you would make a
terrible sorority sister.

know nothing about Liam.

00:32:54,111 --> 00:32:56,211
This was about making you happy.

797
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,578
No. If that were true, I would've bought

798
00:32:57,647 --> 00:32:59,013
a silk Valentino jumpsuit.

799
00:32:59,082 --> 00:33:01,015
This was for Liam, you know?

800
00:33:01,084 --> 00:33:03,317
For him to realize how much I love him.

all this hoop-jumping.

be such a huge production.

Yeah, but that's what I do.

00:33:09,159 --> 00:33:11,025
You know, big, dramatic statements

805
00:33:11,094 --> 00:33:13,828
that are unforgettable and
put everyone else to shame.

806
00:33:13,897 --> 00:33:16,063
And don't forget how touched
you were by Liam's gift,

807
00:33:16,132 --> 00:33:18,065
and that was just a piece of paper.

808
00:33:18,134 --> 00:33:19,867
Well, I'm assuming
that wasn't the whole gift.

809
00:33:19,935 --> 00:33:23,003
As long as Liam knows you love him,

810
00:33:23,072 --> 00:33:24,905
that's all that really matters.

811
00:33:27,609 --> 00:33:30,177

It's fine.
That's the least of my problems.

814

What is going on?

815
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:43,223
Either Kelly or Donna ate too
many shrimp and is now sick.

816
00:33:43,292 --> 00:33:45,625
But since they're a duo,
one won't sing solo.

817
00:33:46,558 --> 00:33:48,195
And if there's no performance,

818
00:33:48,264 --> 00:33:50,029
then people won't have a good time,
and if people

819
00:33:50,098 --> 00:33:52,432
don't have a good time,
then they won't donate money

820
00:33:52,501 --> 00:33:55,435
and this whole night will
have been for nothing.

821
00:33:55,504 --> 00:33:57,304
And you took off your necklace.

822
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:01,374

00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:14,387
but Kelly doesn't feel
up to performing tonight.

827
00:34:14,456 --> 00:34:17,390
I hate to let everyone down,
but I can't sing a duet

828
00:34:17,459 --> 00:34:19,426
without the other half of my duo.

I can carry a tune pretty well.

see me perform with Kelly.

perform for a charity

Thanks again for stepping in.

- You sounded great.
- Aw, well, it was for a good cause.

878
00:36:55,633 --> 00:36:57,466
And you know,
us Lambda Lambda Nus have to...

879
00:36:57,535 --> 00:36:58,768
Sorry.

00:37:00,237 --> 00:37:01,270
- So I was thinking...
- Mm?

882
00:37:01,338 --> 00:37:02,571
I can talk to Kelly,

883
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,072
see if she's up for
playing your wedding,

884
00:37:04,141 --> 00:37:06,241
since you filled in for her.

885
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:08,277
Oh, well, you know what? Since you guys

886
00:37:08,345 --> 00:37:10,613
weren't even the right band,
I'm actually good.

887
00:37:10,681 --> 00:37:12,848
But do you happen to
know the Kelly Sisters?

888
00:37:12,917 --> 00:37:15,317
Tell me that there's
some relation, or...?

890
00:37:17,021 --> 00:37:18,954
I guess not.

891
00:37:19,023 --> 00:37:21,990
Only you could completely
humiliate yourself

892
00:37:22,059 --> 00:37:23,992
and still end up winning the night.

893
00:37:24,061 --> 00:37:26,028
Well, like any skill,

894
00:37:26,096 --> 00:37:28,477
it only gets stronger
the more you practice.

895
00:37:28,512 --> 00:37:29,597
You know, maybe if you used

896
00:37:29,666 --> 00:37:31,666
that skill for good,
you might know what to do for Liam.

897
00:37:31,735 --> 00:37:33,936
No, I do, I do. Thanks to you.

898
00:37:34,004 --> 00:37:37,472
I have decided I am going
to write Liam a song

899
00:37:37,541 --> 00:37:39,107
and perform it at the wedding.

900
00:37:39,176 --> 00:37:41,143
He will be a puddle at the end.

901
00:37:41,211 --> 00:37:44,479
Kind of like when John Legend
wrote "All of Me" for Chrissy Teigen.

902
00:37:44,548 --> 00:37:45,880
Yeah.

903
00:37:45,950 --> 00:37:48,483
Maybe I should just get
John Legend to write it.

904
00:37:48,552 --> 00:37:51,320
No, no, you're right.
I'll write it myself.

905
00:37:51,388 --> 00:37:52,520
- So thank you.
- Of course.

906
00:37:52,589 --> 00:37:54,689
Now I need a favor from you.

907
00:37:54,758 --> 00:37:57,492
Dominique and Vanessa have been
using me as a pawn for ratings.

908
00:37:57,561 --> 00:38:00,795
They faked a fight so Vanessa could
look like she was on team Culhane.

909
00:38:00,864 --> 00:38:02,564
Now I need to strike back.

910
00:38:02,632 --> 00:38:04,632
And there's only one
name that comes to mind

911
00:38:04,701 --> 00:38:06,234
when I think of revenge.

912
00:38:06,303 --> 00:38:08,479
Fallon? Aw!

913
00:38:08,514 --> 00:38:10,708
I'm flattered. Thank you, Culhane.

914
00:38:10,743 --> 00:38:11,773
Now, the first thing

915
00:38:11,841 --> 00:38:13,675
you need to know about
revenge is that sometimes

916
00:38:13,743 --> 00:38:15,643

what your text meant.

919
00:38:21,985 --> 00:38:23,217
What text?

920
00:38:23,286 --> 00:38:26,387
This one. "I-M-U-B."

921
00:38:26,456 --> 00:38:30,024
"I miss you, buddy."

922
00:38:30,093 --> 00:38:31,926
That was an accidental text.

923
00:38:31,995 --> 00:38:34,328
IMUB doesn't mean anything.

924
00:38:34,397 --> 00:38:37,098
You're reading into something
that literally means nothing.

925
00:38:37,166 --> 00:38:40,902
Oh, well, it means something to me.

926
00:38:40,971 --> 00:38:44,905
Because IMU... B.

927
00:38:45,633 --> 00:38:46,740
We haven't talked in two days,

928
00:38:46,809 --> 00:38:49,543
which is, like, forever in us time.

929
00:38:49,612 --> 00:38:50,744

930

933
00:38:58,654 --> 00:39:01,555
An itchy polyester blend T-shirt
of a band I don't even know.

934
00:39:01,624 --> 00:39:03,957
That's how much I love you.

That's why I'm here, not in Adam's loft.

Also, he's in a bad mood.
