165
00:06:32,715 --> 00:06:35,818
Drywall must be complete by end of day.

166
00:06:35,819 --> 00:06:37,795
This hotel opens in one week.

167
00:06:37,796 --> 00:06:39,891
- Thank you.
- Looking good.

168
00:06:39,892 --> 00:06:40,984
As are you.

169
00:06:40,985 --> 00:06:43,662
The Italians cut a better
suit than DeKalb County Jail.

170
00:06:43,663 --> 00:06:46,847
I can't tell you how
sorry I am. What Blake did.

171
00:06:46,848 --> 00:06:47,968
Unforgivable.

172
00:06:47,969 --> 00:06:49,687
Thanks. I appreciate that.

173
00:06:49,688 --> 00:06:52,472
And I'm sorry for the way
things turned out with Kirby.

174
00:06:52,473 --> 00:06:53,807
It was just bad timing.

175
00:06:53,808 --> 00:06:56,026
Oh, no need for apologies, really.

176
00:06:56,027 --> 00:06:58,631
Um, I'm sure you're both gonna be fine.

177
00:06:58,632 --> 00:07:00,939
You're right. No need
to dwell on the past.

178
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:04,632
Mm. And what about the
future for Michael Culhane?

179
00:07:04,633 --> 00:07:06,462
Well, I'm back to running the Atlantix,

180
00:07:06,463 --> 00:07:08,297
and that's actually why I'm here.

181
00:07:08,298 --> 00:07:10,299
We got a new midfielder in from Cuba.

182
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,492
Could take the Atlantix
to the next level.

183
00:07:12,493 --> 00:07:14,439
But he's only been here a few weeks,

184
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,410
and his place got broken
into the other night.

185
00:07:16,411 --> 00:07:17,807
He's kind of shaken up.

186
00:07:17,808 --> 00:07:18,999
I'm sure he is.

187
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,836
Anyway, I figure a few days' quiet

188
00:07:21,837 --> 00:07:23,312
could do him a lot of good.

189
00:07:23,313 --> 00:07:25,130
I know you guys are a little ways out

190
00:07:25,131 --> 00:07:27,966
from opening up, but I thought
you might have a room finished.

191
00:07:27,967 --> 00:07:30,510
You do realize we're
not operational yet.

192
00:07:30,511 --> 00:07:33,180
Which is exactly why no one
will be looking for him here.

193
00:07:33,181 --> 00:07:34,848
And I trust you guys.

194
00:07:34,849 --> 00:07:37,351
The team will pay
well above market rate,

195
00:07:37,352 --> 00:07:40,646
and I see no reason why
this place could not be

196
00:07:40,647 --> 00:07:43,815
the official hotel
for the visiting teams.

197
00:07:43,816 --> 00:07:45,400
I-I'll speak to Sam.

198
00:07:45,401 --> 00:07:47,503
I can't think of a better
partnership for the hotel.

199
00:07:47,504 --> 00:07:48,654
(BOTH LAUGH)

200
00:07:48,655 --> 00:07:50,064
GUNNERSON: <i>Mrs. Carrington.</i>

201
00:07:50,065 --> 00:07:52,804
Just adjusting the menu to
accommodate our new guests.

202
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:54,493
Thank you.

203
00:07:54,494 --> 00:07:57,537
Though I don't have
RSVPs from any of them.

204
00:07:57,538 --> 00:07:58,872
Did the invitations go out all right?

205
00:07:58,873 --> 00:08:01,385
- Yes. I think so.
- You think?

206
00:08:01,386 --> 00:08:03,544
Well, I made them just
the way we talked about,

207
00:08:03,545 --> 00:08:05,354
and then Mr. Carrington took one.

208
00:08:05,355 --> 00:08:06,880
Blake?

209
00:08:06,881 --> 00:08:09,377
No. Mr. Adam.

210
00:08:09,378 --> 00:08:12,278
He was going to pull a few
bottles to send along with them.

211
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:13,736
Did he not tell you?

212
00:08:14,555 --> 00:08:16,223
He must have forgotten.

213
00:08:16,224 --> 00:08:18,016
- I'm sorry, ma'am.
- It's not your fault.

214
00:08:18,017 --> 00:08:21,037
You're not gonna tell him,
are you? That I told you.

215
00:08:21,038 --> 00:08:23,855
Don't worry. If I've
learned anything from Fallon,

216
00:08:23,856 --> 00:08:25,532
it's not to pick a fight with Adam.

217
00:08:25,533 --> 00:08:28,626
I just need to keep him busy
until this tasting is over.

218
00:08:28,627 --> 00:08:30,894
JEFF: <i>So, you said that you'd do</i>

219
00:08:30,895 --> 00:08:32,623
anything to make things right?

220
00:08:32,624 --> 00:08:34,574
- Of course.
- JEFF: Well, I got something.

221
00:08:34,575 --> 00:08:36,243
The annual Blue Belt
wine tasting is tonight

222
00:08:36,244 --> 00:08:37,461
at Carrington Manor.

223
00:08:37,462 --> 00:08:39,221
Apparently, Adam's
running the vineyard now.

224
00:08:39,222 --> 00:08:40,747
Prodigal son entrusted with

225
00:08:40,748 --> 00:08:42,916
the last remaining jewel
of the Carrington empire.

226
00:08:42,917 --> 00:08:45,085
It's almost Shakespearean.

227
00:08:45,086 --> 00:08:47,188
It's also an opportunity.

228
00:08:47,189 --> 00:08:48,456
What are you talking about?

229
00:08:48,457 --> 00:08:50,488
I want to put the
last nail in the coffin

230
00:08:50,489 --> 00:08:51,526
of Blake's legacy.

231
00:08:51,527 --> 00:08:52,661
His reputation.

232
00:08:52,662 --> 00:08:54,761
I want to make sure
he can never rebuild.

233
00:08:54,762 --> 00:08:56,763
Well, actually, I want you to.

234
00:08:56,764 --> 00:08:58,827
This is exactly what I meant, Jeff.

235
00:08:58,828 --> 00:09:00,076
You'll never let it go.

236
00:09:00,077 --> 00:09:01,643
Adam and Blake came for my life,

237
00:09:01,644 --> 00:09:04,271
so now I'm coming for theirs,
in a manner of speaking.

238
00:09:04,272 --> 00:09:05,939
And if you're really Team Colby,

239
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:08,442
you'll help me.

240
00:09:08,443 --> 00:09:09,923
(QUIETLY): I knew she wouldn't do it.

241
00:09:11,626 --> 00:09:13,218
What do you want me to do?

242
00:09:14,883 --> 00:09:16,834
Get into the manor and
make sure that tasting

243
00:09:16,835 --> 00:09:18,002
is Blue Belt's last.

244
00:09:18,003 --> 00:09:20,096
And then what? Set the house on fire?

245
00:09:20,097 --> 00:09:21,329
Oaky, don't be melodramatic.

246
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:23,081
I don't want you burning down the house.

247
00:09:23,082 --> 00:09:26,059
I just want Adam to get a
little taste of his own medicine.

248
00:09:27,938 --> 00:09:30,606
(FALLON GRUNTING)

249
00:09:30,607 --> 00:09:32,065
Oh.

250
00:09:34,427 --> 00:09:37,137
That's inconvenient. (EXHALES)

251
00:09:37,138 --> 00:09:41,108
Liam, you better be in here
and you better be alone.

252
00:09:41,109 --> 00:09:42,742
Open the door.

253
00:09:43,811 --> 00:09:45,979
Liam?

254
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:48,815
Fallon? What are you doing here?

255
00:09:48,816 --> 00:09:52,152
If you remembered me, this
really wouldn't surprise you.

256
00:09:52,153 --> 00:09:53,236
And you should know

257
00:09:53,237 --> 00:09:56,490
that I almost brought a boom
box, but more importantly...

258
00:09:56,491 --> 00:09:58,842
(GRUNTS)... I brought this.

259
00:10:00,119 --> 00:10:01,462
It's your book, about us.

260
00:10:01,463 --> 00:10:04,164
Oh, there must be a copy here somewhere.

261
00:10:04,165 --> 00:10:06,308
No, no. I mean, not
the original manuscript,

262
00:10:06,309 --> 00:10:08,477
with your original notes, inside jokes,

263
00:10:08,478 --> 00:10:09,979
and conversations we had. I just...

264
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:11,689
I really, really need you to read it

265
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:13,613
before you do something
crazy, because...

266
00:10:13,614 --> 00:10:14,714
MAN: Freeze!

267
00:10:16,302 --> 00:10:18,903
(GRUNTS) Hurry. Just take it.

268
00:10:19,522 --> 00:10:21,489
No.

269
00:10:24,026 --> 00:10:27,145
I think Adam may be a little shaken up

270
00:10:27,146 --> 00:10:28,758
with this whole winery situation.

271
00:10:28,759 --> 00:10:29,842
What do you mean?

272
00:10:29,843 --> 00:10:32,025
He's had some trouble
finding his footing.

273
00:10:32,026 --> 00:10:33,819
First he had to leave the soccer team,

274
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:36,029
and now he's feeling
pushed out of Blue Belt.

275
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:37,154
I didn't fire him.

276
00:10:37,155 --> 00:10:38,248
I know that,

277
00:10:38,249 --> 00:10:40,659
but you saw how he reacted at breakfast.

278
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:42,828
He's insecure.

279
00:10:42,829 --> 00:10:45,288
I think he needs a reminder
that your relationship

280
00:10:45,289 --> 00:10:46,604
is bigger than business.

281
00:10:48,209 --> 00:10:50,001
You are right. Of course.

282
00:10:50,002 --> 00:10:51,920
The two of you could
spend the day together.

283
00:10:51,921 --> 00:10:54,481
Just father and son.
No business allowed.

284
00:10:55,747 --> 00:10:58,414
This reeks of excessive force.

285
00:10:58,415 --> 00:11:00,187
Ma'am, we're private security.

286
00:11:00,188 --> 00:11:01,271
And I haven't touched you.

287
00:11:01,272 --> 00:11:03,947
- You can still expect a civil suit.
- Mm.

288
00:11:05,351 --> 00:11:07,831
(GRUNTING)

289
00:11:07,832 --> 00:11:09,649
So maybe you should lawyer up.

290
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:10,741
LAURA: When I got a tip

291
00:11:10,742 --> 00:11:13,361
that there was an
intruder on the property,

292
00:11:13,362 --> 00:11:15,839
I wondered whether you were crazy enough

293
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,824
to come here; a mother's intuition,

294
00:11:17,825 --> 00:11:19,325
that never fails.

295
00:11:19,326 --> 00:11:21,452
The only reason I'm
not calling the police

296
00:11:21,453 --> 00:11:24,163
is because I do not want
to ruin Liam's special day.

297
00:11:24,164 --> 00:11:26,141
Special day?

298
00:11:26,142 --> 00:11:28,009
That's right.

299
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:29,910
These last few weeks have

300
00:11:29,911 --> 00:11:32,271
really put things into perspective.

301
00:11:32,272 --> 00:11:34,157
And when it's true love, why wait?

302
00:11:34,158 --> 00:11:35,725
So Ashley and Liam

303
00:11:35,726 --> 00:11:37,902
have decided to skip
all the accoutrement

304
00:11:37,903 --> 00:11:40,088
and just go straight to the
courthouse this afternoon.

305
00:11:40,089 --> 00:11:42,781
<i>Our</i> courthouse?

306
00:11:42,782 --> 00:11:44,617
(CHUCKLES)

307
00:11:44,618 --> 00:11:47,286
You're even more
unbalanced than I thought.

308
00:11:47,287 --> 00:11:48,930
And I'm warning you, if you step foot

309
00:11:48,931 --> 00:11:50,673
near that courthouse,
you'll lose a lot more than

310
00:11:50,674 --> 00:11:52,891
the one ounce of dignity you have left.

311
00:11:57,361 --> 00:12:00,897
She thinks that this is a
game, that her son is... (GASPS)

312
00:12:01,934 --> 00:12:04,876
not a real person with a real fiancée.

313
00:12:04,877 --> 00:12:07,750
- Hey, are you listening to me?
- Not really.

314
00:12:07,751 --> 00:12:08,893
Anders was just texting me 'cause

315
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:10,068
I was supposed to be at the hotel

316
00:12:10,069 --> 00:12:12,516
half an hour ago, and Culhane...

317
00:12:12,517 --> 00:12:15,227
Never mind. I am listening.
You wanted to play a game?

318
00:12:15,228 --> 00:12:17,538
There is no game. This is a war.

319
00:12:17,539 --> 00:12:19,722
I have to get that manuscript to Liam.

320
00:12:19,723 --> 00:12:21,298
(SCOFFS) I'm sorry, did we just

321
00:12:21,299 --> 00:12:22,724
travel back in time to this morning?

322
00:12:22,725 --> 00:12:24,801
Fallon, you've already

It's over, honey.

324
00:12:26,011 --> 00:12:28,294
It's not over until that
manuscript is in Liam's hands.

325
00:12:28,295 --> 00:12:29,815
You can't go back there.

326
00:12:29,816 --> 00:12:32,216
- You're right.
- Yeah.

327

They will be looking for me,

328
00:12:33,886 --> 00:12:36,262
but they won't be looking for you.

329
00:12:36,263 --> 00:12:38,240
(CHUCKLES): Oh, no.

330
00:12:38,241 --> 00:12:40,817
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
I'm already late for work.

331

What? Sam, you can't be
late. You're the boss.

All you have to do is
get onto the property,

335
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:49,993
grab that manuscript and give it to Liam

336

through it. It'll be really easy.

for the party tonight.

349

Though I don't think it's
that kind of party anymore.

What do you mean?

351
00:13:26,438 --> 00:13:31,150
I think Cristal's new
vision is a little trendier,

352
00:13:31,151 --> 00:13:32,610
judging by the guest list.

353
00:13:32,611 --> 00:13:34,946
I mean, do you know any of these people?

00:13:34,947 --> 00:13:37,299
Yeah. The Carters, right there.

355
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:39,968
Yeah, that's not Jimmy and
Rosalynn, that's Beyoncé.

356
00:13:39,969 --> 00:13:41,711

Hey, let's give her a chance, huh?

359
00:13:45,767 --> 00:13:48,477
Cristal, not Beyoncé.

00:13:48,478 --> 00:13:51,146
Besides, Tears For Fears is
a little more my style anyway.

- Yes.
- I remember when that song came out.

362
00:13:54,174 --> 00:13:56,985
I was younger than you. My
hair was a little longer.

seen my moves back then.

00:14:01,941 --> 00:14:03,182
- you just might.

You called in that tip to
Laura Van Kirk, didn't you?

I don't know what you're talking about.

And I don't think I want to know.

375
00:14:15,861 --> 00:14:17,653
I just needed five
minutes with my fiancé.

376
00:14:17,654 --> 00:14:18,863
Instead, I almost got arrested

Yeah. I was feeling a
bit nostalgic for my 20s.

I didn't want to distract you.

00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:00,251
I've been talking with Cristal.

484
00:19:00,252 --> 00:19:01,908
She says wine sales

485
00:19:01,909 --> 00:19:03,278
were basically nonexistent this month.

486
00:19:03,279 --> 00:19:04,613
Why didn't you say anything?

487
00:19:04,614 --> 00:19:08,240
Well, you know, it's
just a passing phase.

488
00:19:08,241 --> 00:19:09,690
Once the new cycle moves on,

489
00:19:09,691 --> 00:19:11,649
everyone will forget about the scandals

490
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:14,122
and remember how much
they love Blue Belt wine.

491
00:19:14,123 --> 00:19:16,582
Starting tonight, I hope.

492
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:18,010
I'll toast to that.

493
00:19:18,011 --> 00:19:19,978
- Want to do the honors?
- What'd you pick?

494
00:19:24,276 --> 00:19:26,443
What the hell is this?

495
00:19:26,444 --> 00:19:27,610
What?

496
00:19:28,958 --> 00:19:31,973
- Oh, I think it's Cristal.
- Yeah, I know it's Cristal.

497
00:19:31,974 --> 00:19:33,266
What is her face doing
on this wine bottle?

498
00:19:33,267 --> 00:19:34,843
Don't ask me. Didn't
she talk to you about it?

499
00:19:34,844 --> 00:19:36,645
About taking me off my own label? No.

500
00:19:36,646 --> 00:19:38,939
- We didn't talk about this.
- Wow.

501
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:40,791
First your friends, now your face.

502
00:19:40,792 --> 00:19:42,141
If I didn't know any better, I'd think

503
00:19:42,142 --> 00:19:43,652
she was trying to erase
you from Blue Belt.

504
00:19:43,653 --> 00:19:45,629
JENNINGS: <i>He said I made those?</i>

505
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:48,339
Well, that's your face, isn't it?

506
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:50,134
Yes, it's my face.

507
00:19:50,135 --> 00:19:51,536
Same as the day we met.

508
00:19:51,537 --> 00:19:53,286
But I have never seen that label before

509
00:19:53,287 --> 00:19:54,963
in my life.

510
00:19:54,964 --> 00:19:57,791
This is obviously Adam
trying to embarrass me.

511
00:19:57,792 --> 00:19:58,951
I told you this morning,

512
00:19:58,952 --> 00:20:00,548
he doesn't want me
involved in the winery.

513
00:20:00,549 --> 00:20:03,075
Then why would he put
your face on the label?

514
00:20:03,076 --> 00:20:05,175
For the same reason he
showed you that guest list.

515
00:20:05,176 --> 00:20:07,651
To make it look like I'm
trying to take over the company.

516
00:20:07,652 --> 00:20:09,160
Are you?

517
00:20:09,161 --> 00:20:11,019
Adam didn't make that
new guest list. You did.

518
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:13,671
But only because I...

519
00:20:13,672 --> 00:20:15,141
'Cause I'm a liability right now?

520
00:20:15,142 --> 00:20:17,517
Blake, you are under a lot of stress...

521
00:20:17,518 --> 00:20:19,494
Yeah, this is not helping!

(SIGHS)

523
00:20:22,491 --> 00:20:24,651
Liam's bedroom is around the back.

524
00:20:24,652 --> 00:20:26,800
(OVER EARPIECE): First
floor, on the corner.

525
00:20:26,801 --> 00:20:29,381
And the manuscript should
be right under his balcony.

526
00:20:34,669 --> 00:20:36,036
Did you find it?

527
00:20:36,037 --> 00:20:37,372
Not yet.

528
00:20:37,373 --> 00:20:38,806
Did you find it now?

529
00:20:40,042 --> 00:20:41,353
Wait, I see it.

530
00:20:41,354 --> 00:20:44,030
It's way under there, though.
I don't know if I can reach it.

531
00:20:44,031 --> 00:20:46,390
Okay, I climbed that
building in heels, Sam.

532
00:20:46,391 --> 00:20:48,325
Suck it up.

533

534
00:20:53,166 --> 00:20:54,759
There are thorns everywhere.

535
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:55,926
Got it.

536
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:59,794
You owe me a facial.

537
00:21:05,795 --> 00:21:08,271
(GROANS) That little troll.

CULHANE: <i>Here we are.</i>

539
00:21:11,926 --> 00:21:15,613
Home, for the next few days at least.

540
00:21:15,614 --> 00:21:16,948
Thank you.

541
00:21:16,949 --> 00:21:19,141
This is... it's great.

542
00:21:19,142 --> 00:21:21,699
Well, the team is a family;
that's what family does.

543
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,317
You got my number if you need me,

544
00:21:23,318 --> 00:21:25,031
and I'll be sure to have my
office reach out to you...

545
00:21:25,032 --> 00:21:27,649
No. Don't.

546
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:29,716
Well, it'd just be easier if
you can't get in contact with me.

547
00:21:29,717 --> 00:21:31,320
It's safer if no one knows.

548
00:21:31,321 --> 00:21:33,391
I know you're shaken
up by what happened,

549
00:21:33,392 --> 00:21:35,285
but the police will
find whoever broke in.

550
00:21:35,286 --> 00:21:36,383
I already know who it was.

551
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:38,193
What? Who?

552
00:21:40,579 --> 00:21:43,414
Things in Cuba were... bad.

553
00:21:43,415 --> 00:21:45,096
It wasn't safe.

554
00:21:45,097 --> 00:21:48,920
I was trying to get out for a
long time, and I needed help.

555
00:21:48,921 --> 00:21:51,780
And these guys, that's what they do.

556
00:21:51,781 --> 00:21:54,742
They're very expensive,
and I didn't have the money.

557
00:21:54,743 --> 00:21:56,544
- What do they want?
- To get paid.

558
00:21:56,545 --> 00:21:58,537
- And did you pay them?
- Yes.

559
00:21:58,538 --> 00:22:01,099
But now they want more, and
every time I say no, they...

560
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:03,125
- They sent you a message.
- No one should know I'm here.

561
00:22:03,126 --> 00:22:05,419
You're telling me.

562
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:08,797
She said she'd never
seen those labels before,

563
00:22:08,798 --> 00:22:10,183
- that you must've made them.
- When?

564
00:22:10,184 --> 00:22:12,291
I've been with you most
of the day. (STAMMERS)

565
00:22:12,292 --> 00:22:13,985
Why would I put Cristal's
face on anything?

566
00:22:13,986 --> 00:22:15,053
I asked her the same thing.

567
00:22:15,054 --> 00:22:16,805
She said that you want
her out of the winery.

568
00:22:16,806 --> 00:22:18,950
I want what's best for the winery,

569
00:22:18,951 --> 00:22:21,126
which is why I managed to
find some of the old labels.

570
00:22:21,127 --> 00:22:22,912
We'll switch them out before tonight.

571
00:22:22,913 --> 00:22:24,363
No. This whole thing was a mistake.

572
00:22:24,364 --> 00:22:26,088
I thought it would bring
the family closer together.

573
00:22:26,089 --> 00:22:28,459
It's caused nothing but strife.
I'm canceling the tasting.

574
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:29,944
No, no, you can't do that.

575
00:22:29,945 --> 00:22:31,555
Look, I don't know what's
happening with Cristal,

576
00:22:31,556 --> 00:22:34,341
but it's not about her
tonight; it's about your winery.

577
00:22:34,342 --> 00:22:35,392
Everything's already in motion.

578
00:22:35,393 --> 00:22:36,968
We may as well just make the best of it.

579
00:22:36,969 --> 00:22:39,612
I'll-I'll call Bob
Channing and the Carters.

580
00:22:41,295 --> 00:22:42,919
Just give me a chance.

581
00:22:44,185 --> 00:22:45,310
Fine.

582
00:22:45,311 --> 00:22:47,496
All right. You won't regret it.

What a surprise.

586
00:22:53,319 --> 00:22:55,501
Don't worry, I'm not here
for your little wine party.

587
00:22:55,502 --> 00:22:57,819
I'm sure my invitation
was lost in the mail.

588
00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:00,129
Yeah, I'll go check on that.

589
00:23:01,329 --> 00:23:03,361
So what are you doing here, hmm?

590
00:23:03,362 --> 00:23:04,696
Haven't seen enough of me lately?

591
00:23:04,697 --> 00:23:06,773
Or did you already go
through that million?

592
00:23:06,774 --> 00:23:09,405
I'm here to ask for your word
that you'll leave Jeff alone.

593
00:23:09,406 --> 00:23:11,627
(CHUCKLES): Oh, really?

594
00:23:11,628 --> 00:23:14,438
'Cause I seem to recall
you giving me your word

595
00:23:14,439 --> 00:23:15,773
that he'd be out of my hair.

596
00:23:15,774 --> 00:23:17,608
All of a sudden, he's back in Atlanta.

597
00:23:17,609 --> 00:23:19,801
I said I would handle it, and I will.

598
00:23:19,802 --> 00:23:22,530
Nothing needs to change,
including my payments.

599
00:23:22,531 --> 00:23:23,905
So are we good?

600
00:23:26,118 --> 00:23:28,101
Luckily for you, I've got my hands full

601
00:23:28,102 --> 00:23:29,528
with these Georgia state prosecutors

602
00:23:29,529 --> 00:23:32,773
right now, so, yeah, I'll
stand down as long as he does.

FALLON (OVER EARPIECE):
Okay, when you get in,

605
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,205
you should see a tacky spiral staircase.

606
00:23:39,206 --> 00:23:40,456
You want to go left there

607
00:23:40,457 --> 00:23:41,612
and then down that hall.

608
00:23:41,613 --> 00:23:44,618
You're gonna walk by, like,
four big oil portraits of Laura,

00:23:44,619 --> 00:23:46,495

the nose to me, but...

Uh, can we save the running commentary?

611
00:23:48,665 --> 00:23:50,290
Okay, so left at the staircase.

612
00:23:50,291 --> 00:23:51,642
Uh, right.

613
00:23:51,643 --> 00:23:53,043
You said left.

614
00:23:53,044 --> 00:23:55,250
FALLON: No, no, no, no.
Yeah, but it actually...

615
00:23:55,251 --> 00:23:56,814
it actually is a right.

616
00:23:56,815 --> 00:23:58,649
Are you trying to confuse me?

617
00:23:58,650 --> 00:23:59,984
No, no. Okay, I have a headache.

618
00:23:59,985 --> 00:24:01,635
I mean, it must be from all this stress.

You're stressed? I'm the one trespassing

in a stranger's home

00:25:24,218 --> 00:25:27,646
I was saying a little
prayer for my... cat.

643
00:25:27,647 --> 00:25:29,073
Really? Your cat?

644
00:25:29,074 --> 00:25:30,766
She's very sick,

645
00:25:30,767 --> 00:25:34,078
and the medicine are very expensive.

646
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:35,821
And that's why I really,

647
00:25:35,822 --> 00:25:37,339
really, really have to keep this job.

648
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:39,566
So if you would just please
show me to Mr. Ridley.

649
00:25:39,567 --> 00:25:40,950
- Please.
- What about Mr. Ridley?

650
00:25:41,903 --> 00:25:43,921
- No, no!
- Here you go.

651
00:25:43,922 --> 00:25:45,331
Liam.

652
00:25:45,332 --> 00:25:47,216
(GASPS) Liam?

653
00:25:47,217 --> 00:25:48,334
You look great.

654
00:25:48,335 --> 00:25:49,743
LIAM: I'm sorry.

655
00:25:49,744 --> 00:25:52,338
My memory's not what it
used to be. Have-have we met?

656
00:25:52,339 --> 00:25:55,345
It's just me, Sam, arguably
Fallon's best friend.

657
00:25:55,346 --> 00:25:57,779
- Fallon Carrington?
- Just give him the book, Sam!

658
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:59,169
She tried to give you this earlier.

659
00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:01,963
It's your book about
her. If you just read it,

660
00:26:01,964 --> 00:26:03,965
you might remember the truth,
that you guys are in love.

661
00:26:03,966 --> 00:26:05,734
I'm getting security.

662
00:26:07,354 --> 00:26:08,704
LIAM: I'm-I'm really flattered,

663
00:26:08,705 --> 00:26:11,181
but I'm on kind of a tight
schedule at the moment.

664
00:26:11,182 --> 00:26:13,108
- I'm getting married today.
- Just let me talk to Liam.

665
00:26:13,109 --> 00:26:15,619
Uh, this is Fallon. She's on the phone.

666
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:18,197
- (PHONE BEEPS)
- Okay, Fallon, you're on speaker.

667
00:26:18,198 --> 00:26:20,649
And security is probably on their way,

668
00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:22,776
- so skip the small talk.
- FALLON: Liam,

669
00:26:22,777 --> 00:26:24,353
I know this is crazy,

670
00:26:24,354 --> 00:26:26,446
and I know that you're supposed
to be getting married today,

671
00:26:26,447 --> 00:26:27,656
but that is why I really,

672
00:26:27,657 --> 00:26:29,449
really need you to read this book first,

673
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:31,093
because even if you can't remember yet,

674
00:26:31,094 --> 00:26:33,045
what we had was magical.

675
00:26:33,046 --> 00:26:34,629
It was epic, even.

Yes. Sorry I'm late.

BLAKE: Who did this?

730
00:29:23,419 --> 00:29:24,928
I commissioned them

731
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:27,380
after our first conversation
about the winery,

732
00:29:27,381 --> 00:29:28,858
when you told me

733
00:29:28,859 --> 00:29:30,550
about the hummingbird that flew by

734
00:29:30,551 --> 00:29:32,603
when you were signing
to buy the property,

735
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:35,030
and how you thought
it must be a good omen.

736
00:29:35,031 --> 00:29:37,052
Or the bluebells

737
00:29:37,053 --> 00:29:40,685
that grow all over the vineyard,

738
00:29:40,686 --> 00:29:42,780
and how Fallon used to
pick them to make bouquets

739
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:44,397
when she was a little girl,

740
00:29:44,398 --> 00:29:47,083
how it was the first place
you ever drove a tractor.

741
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:49,536
(CHUCKLES): And the last.

742
00:29:49,537 --> 00:29:52,790
- You remembered all that?
- Of course.

743
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:54,719
I'm sorry I ever made you feel

744
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,460
like I'd forgotten you in all of this.

745
00:29:56,461 --> 00:30:00,205
You are the heart and soul of Blue Belt.

Shouldn't I be asking you that?

00:30:24,103 --> 00:30:26,218
You burst into song
on the phone, Fallon.

755

And it really does smell weird
in here, kind of like cheese.

So I sang, okay?

757
00:30:30,889 --> 00:30:33,575
I told you, music is the
purest form of expression.

758
00:30:33,576 --> 00:30:35,819
- And he took the book, right?
- Yeah, he did.

759
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:38,437
Do you think he'll read it? I
mean, did he seem interested?

760
00:30:38,438 --> 00:30:39,897
Should I text him? Maybe I'll text him.

That's great. I knew
that once you read it,

962
00:39:19,186 --> 00:39:20,812
you would remember what we had.

963
00:39:20,813 --> 00:39:22,155
You know, you and me, not Trashley...

964
00:39:22,156 --> 00:39:24,023
Fallon. You were right.

965
00:39:24,024 --> 00:39:26,335
I didn't marry Ashley
because of the book.

966
00:39:26,336 --> 00:39:29,028
Obviously, there's way more
to this than I can remember.

967
00:39:29,029 --> 00:39:30,414
- Mm-hmm.
- And I...

968
00:39:30,415 --> 00:39:33,825
I shouldn't marry anyone until
I can fill in those holes.

969
00:39:33,826 --> 00:39:36,369
Or course. We can take it slow.

970
00:39:36,370 --> 00:39:39,539
No. That's not what I mean.

971
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:42,017
The book didn't make me fall in love

972
00:39:42,018 --> 00:39:44,043
with you again.

973
00:39:44,044 --> 00:39:45,687
Or at all.

974
00:39:45,688 --> 00:39:47,248
What?

975
00:39:47,249 --> 00:39:50,859
Look, if I wrote that book, and
if that's how I feel about you...

976
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:55,197
The girl in that book
is selfish, callous.

977
00:39:55,198 --> 00:39:56,556
I mean, she's definitely a narcissist.

978
00:39:56,557 --> 00:39:58,391
Okay, okay, I get it.

979
00:39:58,392 --> 00:39:59,917
I'm sorry.

980
00:39:59,918 --> 00:40:03,730
I just... I think I need
to be on my own for a while.

981
00:40:04,690 --> 00:40:06,232
Okay.

982
00:40:06,233 --> 00:40:08,167
♪♪

983
00:40:20,748 --> 00:40:22,081
I saw you downstairs.

984
00:40:22,082 --> 00:40:23,300
Yeah, you did.

985
00:40:23,301 --> 00:40:25,181
I'm sorry we didn't get
a proper introduction.

986
00:40:25,182 --> 00:40:27,420
- I'm Kirby.
- Victor.

987
00:40:27,421 --> 00:40:29,380
I'd shake your hand, but... (CHUCKLES)

988
00:40:29,381 --> 00:40:31,049
My dad runs the hotel,

989
00:40:31,050 --> 00:40:33,718
so I wanted to come and
give you a proper welcome.

990
00:40:33,719 --> 00:40:34,902
Would you like a drink?

991
00:40:38,723 --> 00:40:40,748
Hey, what if something happened to her?

992
00:40:40,749 --> 00:40:42,016
Or she's gone.

993
00:40:42,952 --> 00:40:44,152
It wouldn't be the first time.

994
00:40:47,876 --> 00:40:50,068
I could use one of those.

995
00:40:50,069 --> 00:40:51,311
Where have you been?

996
00:40:51,312 --> 00:40:52,946
We heard something about
some sort of explosion

997
00:40:52,947 --> 00:40:54,756
- at the Carrington Manor.
- MONICA: Is everyone okay?

998
00:40:54,757 --> 00:40:56,783
I asked Fallon, but she
hasn't texted me back.

999
00:40:56,784 --> 00:40:58,514
It was a gas leak. Fallon's fine.

1000
00:40:58,515 --> 00:41:01,120
Adam Carrington got the brunt of it.

1001
00:41:01,121 --> 00:41:02,431
What happened?

1002
00:41:02,432 --> 00:41:04,624
I was planning on spoiling the wine,

1003
00:41:04,625 --> 00:41:07,536
but let's just say a better
opportunity came along.

1004
00:41:07,537 --> 00:41:09,413
Adam hurt you.

1005
00:41:09,414 --> 00:41:11,580
He tried to do more than that.

1006
00:41:11,581 --> 00:41:14,215
An eye for an eye, isn't it?

1007
00:41:14,994 --> 00:41:16,969
I'm gonna go freshen up.

1008
00:41:19,033 --> 00:41:20,892
You don't think... she...

1009
00:41:20,893 --> 00:41:22,159
I think she did.

1010
00:41:25,401 --> 00:41:26,568
VANESSA: <i>Hello?</i>

1011
00:41:26,569 --> 00:41:28,326
Vanessa? Hi, sweetheart.

1012
00:41:28,327 --> 00:41:31,028
Sorry to call you so late,
but I know you've been worried.

1013
00:41:31,029 --> 00:41:32,837
Things have been a little delicate here,

1014
00:41:32,838 --> 00:41:34,672
but I'm getting it all back on track.

1015
00:41:34,673 --> 00:41:38,700
We are going to get everything
we've always talked about.

1016
00:41:38,701 --> 00:41:40,135
When?

1017
00:41:40,136 --> 00:41:43,680
Soon. I just need you to sit
tight a little while longer.

1018
00:41:43,681 --> 00:41:45,180
Okay?
