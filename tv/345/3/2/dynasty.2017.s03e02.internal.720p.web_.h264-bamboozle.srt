1
00:00:01,113 --> 00:00:03,342
- <i>Previously on</i> Dynasty...
- Marry me again.

2
00:00:03,377 --> 00:00:04,478
Hell yes.

3
00:00:05,739 --> 00:00:07,548
All the Carrington money
and influence in the world

4
00:00:07,625 --> 00:00:09,208
cannot change the fact
that I am innocent.

5
00:00:09,218 --> 00:00:10,334
<i>For some insane reason,</i>

6
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:12,359
you hired divers to find Fallon's ring.

7
00:00:12,394 --> 00:00:13,629
I didn't know there were
two bodies in the lake.

8
00:00:13,705 --> 00:00:15,205
<i>Figure out some way to make sure</i>

9
00:00:15,283 --> 00:00:17,633
<i>that my DNA is not all
over Mack's dead body.</i>

10
00:00:17,709 --> 00:00:19,384
To a fruitful partnership.

11
00:00:19,395 --> 00:00:21,011
I really am glad you're here, though.

12
00:00:21,088 --> 00:00:23,680
What's going on? I'm getting kicked out?

13
00:00:23,757 --> 00:00:25,849
<i>Obviously, I had nothing
to do with Liam's accident.</i>

14
00:00:27,761 --> 00:00:29,019
You know, not everything's my fault.

15
00:00:29,096 --> 00:00:30,896
I don't forget things. And you will pay.

16
00:00:30,907 --> 00:00:33,482
You are under arrest for the
murder of Nathan Macintosh.

17
00:00:33,559 --> 00:00:35,484
- Ashley?
- Laura called me.

18
00:00:35,561 --> 00:00:36,735
- That's Liam's mom.
- Yes,

19
00:00:36,746 --> 00:00:37,845
<i>I know who Laura is.</i>

20
00:00:39,368 --> 00:00:40,405
Liam.

21
00:00:40,689 --> 00:00:41,698
I'm sorry. Who are you?

22
00:00:42,204 --> 00:00:43,292
What?

23
00:01:03,773 --> 00:01:06,223
Your sentencing hearing is in 48 hours.

24
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:07,891
Judge Anson is tough.

25
00:01:07,968 --> 00:01:09,393
Well, shouldn't he be lenient?

26
00:01:09,469 --> 00:01:11,353
I mean, I told the police the truth

27
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:13,438
about what happened
the night Trixie died.

28
00:01:13,449 --> 00:01:15,899
I mean, yes,
I lied about it ten years ago.

29
00:01:15,976 --> 00:01:17,434
And again the other day.

30
00:01:17,511 --> 00:01:20,120
But if it's the same lie,
does it technically count twice?

31
00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:22,239
We're kind of having a meeting.

32
00:01:22,316 --> 00:01:23,782
I'll chew softly.

33
00:01:23,859 --> 00:01:26,314
The judge's decision
could go either way.

34
00:01:26,349 --> 00:01:27,411
What, you mean, like,

35
00:01:27,487 --> 00:01:30,080
the death penalty or
life without parole?

36
00:01:30,157 --> 00:01:31,540
Not helpful.

37
00:01:31,617 --> 00:01:33,208
And could you please close your robe

38
00:01:33,285 --> 00:01:34,960
and put the judge back in chambers?

39
00:01:34,971 --> 00:01:37,254
As you were saying?

40
00:01:37,331 --> 00:01:39,631
Best-case scenario,
you get a slap on the wrist

41
00:01:39,642 --> 00:01:41,383
and some probation, but if the judge

42
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,760
wants to make an example
of a spoiled rich kid

43
00:01:43,837 --> 00:01:45,596
who's always gotten
away with everything,

44
00:01:45,672 --> 00:01:47,973
you could be looking
at five years or more.

45
00:01:47,984 --> 00:01:49,391
No offense.

46
00:01:49,468 --> 00:01:52,436
I'm not sure there's a
way that's not offensive.

47
00:01:52,512 --> 00:01:53,854
I'll see you in a few days.

48
00:01:54,833 --> 00:01:55,939
Ooh.

49
00:01:56,016 --> 00:01:57,383
Why aren't you more freaked out?

50
00:01:57,385 --> 00:01:59,827
I mean, if there's even a
chance you're going to jail,

51
00:01:59,904 --> 00:02:03,780
you should be... getting
a hard-core mani-pedi and facial.

52
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:06,166
Or you could flee the country,
but in that case,

53
00:02:06,243 --> 00:02:08,285
I would wax everything.

54
00:02:08,362 --> 00:02:11,788
I am accepting the consequences
of my actions, remember?

55
00:02:11,865 --> 00:02:15,667
And I am not painting or waxing
anything in the next 48 hours.

56
00:02:15,678 --> 00:02:18,295
I need to use that time to
smack the amnesia out of Liam

57
00:02:18,372 --> 00:02:21,553
and to make him remember that
he loves me and not Trashley.

58
00:02:21,588 --> 00:02:22,799
And that way, if I do go to jail,

59
00:02:22,876 --> 00:02:24,852
I'll have my fiancé waiting
for me when I get out.

60
00:02:24,929 --> 00:02:27,137
- It'll be a love story for the ages.
- Right.

61
00:02:27,214 --> 00:02:29,106
- See you later.
- Bye.

62
00:02:31,027 --> 00:02:33,110
Did Fallon just say
that Liam has amnesia?

63
00:02:34,888 --> 00:02:37,356
Good morning to you... Adam.

64
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:39,942
You know, you shouldn't walk into rooms

65
00:02:40,018 --> 00:02:41,526
asking questions like that.

66
00:02:41,537 --> 00:02:44,446
- It makes you seem weird... er.
- Huh.

67
00:02:46,108 --> 00:02:47,824
What's going on?

68
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:49,209
Breaking ground.

69
00:02:49,286 --> 00:02:51,703
You are aware that
construction has begun?

70
00:02:51,714 --> 00:02:54,873
Yes, but I want to document
the beginning of the new hotel,

71
00:02:54,884 --> 00:02:56,333
so we're faking it.

72
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:57,834
It's called creative license.

73
00:02:57,845 --> 00:02:59,211
And that explains the camera.

74
00:02:59,221 --> 00:03:01,713
Exactly. Also...

75
00:03:01,724 --> 00:03:05,059
renovation progress kills on
social media, so, incoming.

76
00:03:16,763 --> 00:03:19,523
Oh, my God, did we just find treasure?

77
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,733
It could be Al Capone's vault.

78
00:03:21,744 --> 00:03:23,360
Unfamiliar with the reference.

79
00:03:23,437 --> 00:03:24,736
There's a painting here.

80
00:03:24,747 --> 00:03:27,739
"Bernard McCarty, 1923."

81
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,416
Someone you grew up with?

82
00:03:29,493 --> 00:03:31,067
Hilarious.

83
00:03:31,145 --> 00:03:33,870
Let's pile it all up,
and I'll have the dumpster wheeled in.

84
00:03:33,947 --> 00:03:36,248
Sam, hang on.
This-this could be a significant find.

85
00:03:36,258 --> 00:03:39,376
This Bernard McCarty could
be an important figure.

86
00:03:39,453 --> 00:03:41,762
I'm going to call the
Atlanta Historic Alliance.

87
00:03:41,839 --> 00:03:43,213
They're going to want
to investigate this.

88
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:46,008
Well, that investigation
cannot delay construction.

89
00:03:46,084 --> 00:03:48,927
I've already sent out all the
invites for our grand reopening,

90
00:03:48,938 --> 00:03:50,595
and I can't push it back.

91
00:03:50,606 --> 00:03:52,272
I booked Hootie & the Blowfish.

92
00:03:52,349 --> 00:03:54,224
And if I have to settle
for a cover band,

93
00:03:54,301 --> 00:03:55,759
then it basically
becomes a quinceañera,

94
00:03:55,836 --> 00:03:58,228
and then we might as well just
burn the whole thing down.

95
00:03:58,305 --> 00:03:59,521
It won't be an issue.

96
00:03:59,598 --> 00:04:02,774
Trust me, you're doing the right thing.

97
00:04:02,785 --> 00:04:04,518
How are they treating you?
What do you need?

98
00:04:04,553 --> 00:04:06,136
Tell me.
I'll get it for you immediately.

99
00:04:06,171 --> 00:04:08,113
I've been in here, like, an hour.

100
00:04:08,124 --> 00:04:09,948
All right? Relax, both of you.

101
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:11,116
This will be over soon.

102
00:04:11,127 --> 00:04:13,118
Right now we need to focus on business.

103
00:04:13,129 --> 00:04:14,703
The board of Blue Belt Vineyards

104
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:16,621
received a substantial offer last week,

105
00:04:16,698 --> 00:04:18,415
and I know they're
considering accepting it

106
00:04:18,492 --> 00:04:20,801
because of my temporary incapacitation.

107
00:04:20,878 --> 00:04:22,252
They can't sell it without you.

108
00:04:22,329 --> 00:04:24,588
They can if I'm not
there to vote against it.

109
00:04:24,664 --> 00:04:25,806
Blue Belt Vineyards was

110
00:04:25,883 --> 00:04:27,591
the first company I ever acquired.

111
00:04:27,667 --> 00:04:30,811
It has a tremendous amount
of sentimental value to me.

112
00:04:30,888 --> 00:04:34,314
I farmed her land,
I nurtured her grapes.

113
00:04:34,391 --> 00:04:35,599
Really?

114
00:04:36,565 --> 00:04:38,935
No! I paid people to do that.

115
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:40,729
But every time I acquired
another company,

116
00:04:40,806 --> 00:04:42,898
I toasted myself from her oaky barrels.

117
00:04:42,974 --> 00:04:44,816
That company is in my blood.

118
00:04:44,827 --> 00:04:46,610
Also, it's my last major holding.

119
00:04:47,905 --> 00:04:49,279
So I need both of you

120
00:04:49,356 --> 00:04:51,281
to represent me to that board

121
00:04:51,358 --> 00:04:52,949
and put a cork in that sale.

122
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:55,619
I have been on the phone screaming

123
00:04:55,695 --> 00:04:56,828
at the district attorney.

124
00:04:56,905 --> 00:04:59,122
Your bail hearing won't be for two days.

125
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,457
He has to stay here

126
00:05:00,468 --> 00:05:02,042
- for two more days?
- Not ideal.

127
00:05:02,119 --> 00:05:03,510
You should also know

128
00:05:03,587 --> 00:05:06,463
that your DNA was found
inside Mack's body bag.

129
00:05:07,941 --> 00:05:09,593
Adam, I thought you took care of that!

130
00:05:09,628 --> 00:05:10,967
Bag? What bag? Th-There wasn't a bag.

131
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:12,844
Uh, it-it wasn't in that room.

132
00:05:12,855 --> 00:05:14,304
Should I really be hearing this?

133
00:05:14,381 --> 00:05:16,848
I'll do everything I can,
but this is a murder case.

134
00:05:16,859 --> 00:05:18,433
The stakes are higher.

135
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:19,976
This is unbelievable.

136
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:21,770
Oh, you think I'm happy about this?

137
00:05:21,847 --> 00:05:23,939
Both of you need to keep a low profile

138
00:05:24,015 --> 00:05:25,440
if you want to help Blake.

139
00:05:25,517 --> 00:05:27,034
The less press, the better.

140
00:05:27,111 --> 00:05:28,318
Yeah.

141
00:05:28,395 --> 00:05:29,870
But I heard someone in your family

142
00:05:29,947 --> 00:05:31,321
has lined up an interview already.

143
00:05:31,398 --> 00:05:34,366
What? Who?

144
00:05:34,376 --> 00:05:36,451
Dominique.

145
00:05:36,528 --> 00:05:37,711
Ah, Cristal.

146
00:05:37,788 --> 00:05:40,380
I was literally about to call you.

147
00:05:40,457 --> 00:05:42,165
I've been so worried about Blake.

148
00:05:42,242 --> 00:05:44,000
I didn't come to talk about Blake.

149
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:45,877
I came to talk about you.

150
00:05:45,888 --> 00:05:47,337
Oh.

151
00:05:47,414 --> 00:05:49,005
My favorite topic.

152
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:51,391
I heard you scheduled
an interview with TMZ

153
00:05:51,468 --> 00:05:52,884
to talk about the case.

154
00:05:52,961 --> 00:05:54,561
Really more to talk about Jeff.

155
00:05:54,638 --> 00:05:56,221
I want you to cancel it.

156
00:05:56,298 --> 00:05:57,397
Do you?

157
00:05:57,474 --> 00:05:59,516
The less publicity about this,
the better.

158
00:05:59,593 --> 00:06:02,185
Blake needs to look like
a Boy Scout right now.

159
00:06:02,262 --> 00:06:05,981
Cristal, you know I would never
say anything to hurt my family.

160
00:06:06,057 --> 00:06:08,191
Here's what I know, Dominique.

161
00:06:08,268 --> 00:06:10,527
You are not the family spokesperson.

162
00:06:10,604 --> 00:06:11,820
In fact,

163
00:06:11,897 --> 00:06:13,196
you're barely family at all.

164
00:06:13,273 --> 00:06:14,698
Says the girlfriend.

165
00:06:14,774 --> 00:06:16,792
You will cancel the interview?

166
00:06:18,379 --> 00:06:20,162
Otherwise, those secret payoffs

167
00:06:20,238 --> 00:06:22,422
that Blake's been giving
you may stop arriving.

168
00:06:25,035 --> 00:06:28,971
I suppose the police are doing
everything they can for Jeff.

169
00:06:30,957 --> 00:06:32,808
I knew we'd come to an agreement.

170
00:06:40,276 --> 00:06:41,725
It's Dominique Deveraux.

171
00:06:41,801 --> 00:06:43,894
I need to cancel my interview.

172
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:46,354
I'm going to get you
something even juicier

173
00:06:46,431 --> 00:06:47,906
on my half-brother.

174
00:06:51,645 --> 00:06:53,236
Kirby?

175
00:06:53,313 --> 00:06:55,071
Oh. Hi, Dad.

176
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:58,125
Um, I'm just here to use the gym.

177
00:06:58,202 --> 00:07:00,911
I'm working on my fitness and all that.

178
00:07:00,987 --> 00:07:02,204
Well, as you probably guessed,

179
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,464
the-the gym's closed for renovations.

180
00:07:05,626 --> 00:07:07,083
Oh.

181
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,753
And since when have you
been a fitness junkie?

182
00:07:10,274 --> 00:07:11,755
Okay, fine. I hate fitness.

183
00:07:11,831 --> 00:07:13,423
I just need a place to shower,

184
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,975
because I've been sleeping at Femperial

185
00:07:15,052 --> 00:07:17,802
since I got kicked out of the manor,
which is totally chill,

186
00:07:17,813 --> 00:07:20,856
but a-a janitor walked in on
me giving myself a sponge bath.

187
00:07:22,484 --> 00:07:25,936
Not one word you just said
sounds... "chill."

188
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:27,654
Oh, it's-it's fine.

189
00:07:27,731 --> 00:07:29,489
It's all great fodder for the memoir

190
00:07:29,566 --> 00:07:32,359
I'm gonna write one day
and publish myself.

191
00:07:32,852 --> 00:07:35,612
I was under the impression
that you had somewhere to stay.

192
00:07:35,689 --> 00:07:36,997
What happened?

193
00:07:37,074 --> 00:07:39,741
Um, yeah,
I did plan on going to Culhane's.

194
00:07:39,818 --> 00:07:41,826
Um, that didn't really work out.

195
00:07:41,837 --> 00:07:43,119
Of course it didn't.

196
00:07:43,196 --> 00:07:45,121
It was a spectacularly bad idea.

197
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:46,623
Excuse me?

198
00:07:46,634 --> 00:07:48,541
You know how fond I am of Michael,

199
00:07:48,618 --> 00:07:50,335
but he's in jail, Kirby.

200
00:07:50,346 --> 00:07:52,629
Does your life really need
that sort of complication?

201
00:07:52,706 --> 00:07:55,298
Might I remind you that I'm
dating that complication?

202
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:57,425
It's my prerogative to move in with him.

203
00:07:58,171 --> 00:07:59,678
You're going to come and live with me.

204
00:07:59,688 --> 00:08:02,639
My new place has an
excellent spare room.

205
00:08:02,716 --> 00:08:04,391
I'm not a child.

206
00:08:04,467 --> 00:08:06,518
I don't need to live with my father.

207
00:08:06,528 --> 00:08:09,321
In fact, I think Culhane's
will work out just fine.

208
00:08:11,891 --> 00:08:13,817
And you have to remember this day.

209
00:08:13,893 --> 00:08:16,194
I mean, our tennis match
was a little intense,

210
00:08:16,205 --> 00:08:18,488
but then we had the most intimate

211
00:08:18,565 --> 00:08:20,680
pillow fort conversation.

212
00:08:20,715 --> 00:08:22,534
It was actually one of
the best days we ever had.

213
00:08:22,544 --> 00:08:24,828
- And this one... you and I were...
- Fallon.

214
00:08:24,904 --> 00:08:28,248
All right, I believe
we had a relationship. I do.

215
00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:30,092
I mean, how else do you explain that?

216
00:08:31,295 --> 00:08:32,886
Who even took that?

217
00:08:33,643 --> 00:08:35,005
Not important. Wait.

218
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:37,716
So you're saying you remember
we had a relationship?

219
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:40,677
Because we did, and it was...

220
00:08:40,754 --> 00:08:42,887
it was magical, and it was true love.

221
00:08:42,898 --> 00:08:45,515
It-it<i> is</i> true love.

222
00:08:45,592 --> 00:08:47,517
I also know that when we broke up,

223
00:08:47,594 --> 00:08:49,352
you went a little crazy when you heard

224
00:08:49,429 --> 00:08:50,737
me and Ashley were dating again.

225
00:08:50,814 --> 00:08:53,672
Ashley told you that? Is she here?

226
00:08:53,707 --> 00:08:55,400
Because I'd just...
I'd like to have a word with her,

227
00:08:55,411 --> 00:08:56,860
or maybe a heated argument.

228
00:08:56,936 --> 00:08:59,029
Ashley didn't tell me anything.

229
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,363
She went back to New York

230
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,240
to grab some of her stuff to bring back.

231
00:09:02,251 --> 00:09:04,409
Well, maybe she should
bring back the truth,

232
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:05,827
because I never went crazy,

233
00:09:05,904 --> 00:09:07,829
and you and Ashley never dated again.

234
00:09:07,906 --> 00:09:09,923
I mean, you don't remember it
that way, do you?

235
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,334
Where would you even
get an idea like that?

236
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:14,544
Fallon.

237
00:09:14,621 --> 00:09:16,713
What a treat.

238
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:18,640
Lovely to see you again.

239
00:09:19,793 --> 00:09:21,268
I assume that you're here

240
00:09:21,345 --> 00:09:24,604
to prod Liam into remembering you, huh?

241
00:09:24,681 --> 00:09:25,889
So, is it working?

242
00:09:25,965 --> 00:09:27,774
Well, he remembers
that I'm not a psycho,

243
00:09:27,851 --> 00:09:30,435
despite your best efforts
to paint me as one.

244
00:09:30,446 --> 00:09:32,612
Did you show him a picture of the time

245
00:09:32,689 --> 00:09:35,565
that you followed him to Sun
Valley and bludgeoned Ashley

246
00:09:35,642 --> 00:09:37,284
in an effort to steal him back?

247
00:09:37,361 --> 00:09:39,953
Or the time that you bought
the entire publishing company

248
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:43,740
and tried to quash the
release of his beautiful book?

249
00:09:43,817 --> 00:09:45,742
No, I'm guessing
you did not bring pictures

250
00:09:45,819 --> 00:09:47,794
of those less touching memories.

251
00:09:49,032 --> 00:09:51,131
I thought I'd just keep
it to the greatest hits.

252
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:53,291
Liam, I'm going.

253
00:09:53,302 --> 00:09:56,428
I will be back when
Mother Superior is gone.

254
00:09:59,016 --> 00:10:01,091
Well, I'm not wild about the decor,

255
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:02,809
but I appreciate the single cell.

256
00:10:02,886 --> 00:10:04,353
Give my thanks to the warden.

257
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,105
Huh.

258
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:16,940
Culhane.

259
00:10:17,016 --> 00:10:19,776
Of all the prison cells in all the towns

260
00:10:19,853 --> 00:10:21,778
in all the world,

261
00:10:21,855 --> 00:10:24,280
you walk into mine.

262
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:26,666
That is where you're wrong, Blake.

263
00:10:28,912 --> 00:10:31,046
You just walked into mine.

264
00:10:57,668 --> 00:10:59,691
I guess there are no singles in jail.

265
00:10:59,701 --> 00:11:02,694
Except solitary confinement,
which seems less fun.

266
00:11:02,704 --> 00:11:05,071
How fitting is this?

267
00:11:05,082 --> 00:11:07,949
A lifetime of cheating,
treachery and backstabbing

268
00:11:08,026 --> 00:11:10,326
finally lands you where you belong.

269
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:12,954
Suddenly, solitary confinement
doesn't seem so bad.

270
00:11:13,031 --> 00:11:15,132
There's a whole lot of
angry people in here.

271
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:17,217
Most of them feel like
they've been screwed over

272
00:11:17,294 --> 00:11:20,170
by a system that favors the one percent.

273
00:11:20,246 --> 00:11:21,446
You,

274
00:11:21,448 --> 00:11:24,841
you're the one percent
of the one percent.

275
00:11:24,918 --> 00:11:28,854
Which means they hate the
Carringtons most of all.

276
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:31,514
Might be too early to vote
for Most Likely to Be Shivved,

277
00:11:31,591 --> 00:11:36,728
but I'm willing to bet
you will run away with it.

278
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:39,239
You know,
you can badmouth me all you want,

279
00:11:39,316 --> 00:11:41,575
but as soon as I get bail,

280
00:11:41,651 --> 00:11:43,860
I'll be out of this prison suit

281
00:11:43,937 --> 00:11:48,248
and into my Tom Ford
pinstripe suit... like that.

282
00:11:48,325 --> 00:11:50,158
But don't you worry.

283
00:11:50,235 --> 00:11:52,869
I'll be happy to send you
a selfie of my fabulous life

284
00:11:52,946 --> 00:11:55,497
on the outside.

285
00:11:55,573 --> 00:11:58,208
You just found all this here,
behind the wall?

286
00:11:58,284 --> 00:11:59,334
Yes.

287
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:00,552
Yes. We haven't touched a thing.

288
00:12:00,629 --> 00:12:02,670
How much do you think we can get for it?

289
00:12:02,747 --> 00:12:04,923
Oh, no. From here on out,

290
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:09,385
this is all under the purview of
the Atlanta Historical Alliance.

291
00:12:09,462 --> 00:12:12,939
This hotel is a Real McCarty.

292
00:12:13,016 --> 00:12:15,025
Yeah, I'm not following.

293
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:19,896
Well, it appears this building
was designed by Bernard McCarty.

294
00:12:19,973 --> 00:12:21,898
Who, as you must know,

295
00:12:21,975 --> 00:12:24,776
helped put the city
of Atlanta on the map.

296
00:12:24,786 --> 00:12:28,863
A prolific architect who
later became a city planner.

297
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:30,823
And honestly,

298
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:33,576
there's even something
ruggedly dashing about him.

299
00:12:35,687 --> 00:12:37,426
<i>Assuming this all checks out,</i>

300
00:12:37,461 --> 00:12:38,915
your building will be designated

301
00:12:38,992 --> 00:12:41,918
a historical landmark, with a plaque

302
00:12:41,995 --> 00:12:44,921
and all the commemorative
fixings we have available.

303
00:12:44,998 --> 00:12:48,091
Uh, I don't mean
to pooh-pooh your fixings,

304
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:50,260
but I paid an enormous amount
of money for this place.

305
00:12:50,336 --> 00:12:52,095
You can't just turn it into a museum.

306
00:12:52,171 --> 00:12:54,806
Oh, oh, they're not gonna
turn it into a museum, Sam.

307
00:12:54,816 --> 00:12:56,307
They just want to mark the spot

308
00:12:56,318 --> 00:12:58,309
as an important place in history.

309
00:12:59,201 --> 00:13:01,813
Well, in order to authorize
landmark status,

310
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:03,940
we need to bring in conservationists

311
00:13:04,017 --> 00:13:06,401
and authenticators, which means

312
00:13:06,477 --> 00:13:08,611
you cannot touch anything until then.

313
00:13:09,922 --> 00:13:10,947
You're saying a lot of words,

314
00:13:11,024 --> 00:13:13,283
and all I'm hearing is "delay,
delay, delay,"

315
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:15,493
so let's move this thing along,
okay, honey?

316
00:13:15,504 --> 00:13:17,745
And now this is how I spin it into gold:

317
00:13:17,822 --> 00:13:20,173
What if we set up a huge media day

318
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:21,583
and a public dedication?

319
00:13:21,659 --> 00:13:23,009
Everyone should know what we found here.

320
00:13:23,086 --> 00:13:25,053
And then we can get back to work.

321
00:13:26,348 --> 00:13:27,681
Agreed.

322
00:13:27,757 --> 00:13:29,307
I need to call my boss.

323
00:13:31,344 --> 00:13:33,595
You see? Good things come to those

324
00:13:33,671 --> 00:13:36,523
who respect the past.

325
00:13:39,268 --> 00:13:40,810
Sorry I'm late.

326
00:13:40,887 --> 00:13:43,029
Traffic was horrible,
and for some reason,

327
00:13:43,106 --> 00:13:45,607
my driver kept getting lost,
but if we leave right now,

328
00:13:45,683 --> 00:13:47,867
we can get to the board meeting on time.

329
00:13:47,944 --> 00:13:50,278
Oh, you must not have got my texts.

330
00:13:50,355 --> 00:13:52,322
Uh, they moved the meeting up.

331
00:13:52,398 --> 00:13:54,282
I actually just got back.

332
00:13:54,359 --> 00:13:55,658
What?

333
00:13:55,735 --> 00:13:57,076
Well, I figured you weren't interested

334
00:13:57,153 --> 00:13:58,661
or had a hair appointment or something.

335
00:13:58,738 --> 00:14:00,330
Which looks fabulous, by the way.

336
00:14:00,406 --> 00:14:01,623
Did you get it colored?

337
00:14:01,699 --> 00:14:03,133
This is crazy.

338
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:04,834
I was supposed to be there for Blake.

339
00:14:04,911 --> 00:14:07,003
I know. That's what I told the board.

340
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,172
But, you know,
it all worked out in the end.

341
00:14:09,248 --> 00:14:11,633
They named me acting CEO of the winery,

342
00:14:11,709 --> 00:14:14,177
which isn't being sold to anyone.

343
00:14:14,253 --> 00:14:16,938
So, Father will be pleased about that.

344
00:14:19,133 --> 00:14:21,476
You rescheduled
the board meeting, right?

345
00:14:21,552 --> 00:14:22,902
Don't be so paranoid.

346
00:14:22,979 --> 00:14:25,188
I'm not in charge of
scheduling board meetings.

347
00:14:25,264 --> 00:14:27,023
And look, let's be honest.

348
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,700
There's really not much
you could have done there,

349
00:14:28,777 --> 00:14:30,118
you know,
considering you're not a Carrington.

350
00:14:38,569 --> 00:14:39,744
Hey, Doctor.

351
00:14:42,257 --> 00:14:43,873
I'm sorry, I don't remember,
are you, uh...

352
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:48,428
Are you from, uh, psych or neurology?

353
00:14:48,505 --> 00:14:51,473
Yes.

354
00:14:54,276 --> 00:14:56,061
Do you remember me from before?

355
00:14:57,255 --> 00:14:58,605
Uh, no, I don't.

356
00:15:00,849 --> 00:15:02,350
My memory's, uh...

357
00:15:02,427 --> 00:15:04,018
Well, you tell me.

358
00:15:04,095 --> 00:15:07,614
Because this gap in my life is...

359
00:15:07,691 --> 00:15:08,898
insanely frustrating.

360
00:15:08,975 --> 00:15:10,692
Right. Sure.

361
00:15:10,768 --> 00:15:14,028
So... I know we've already
been through this,

362
00:15:14,105 --> 00:15:15,738
but one more time.

363
00:15:15,815 --> 00:15:18,199
What do you remember about
the day of the accident?

364
00:15:18,276 --> 00:15:19,409
Every detail.

365
00:15:19,485 --> 00:15:22,120
Uh, easy. Nothing.

366
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:24,414
That's great. I mean, that's great

367
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:25,915
that you don't remember the pain.

368
00:15:25,992 --> 00:15:27,750
So, what's the last thing
you do remember?

369
00:15:27,827 --> 00:15:29,127
How far back?

370
00:15:29,137 --> 00:15:31,129
Shouldn't you already know this?

371
00:15:31,205 --> 00:15:34,090
Yes, but this is how we
continually test your memory.

372
00:15:35,094 --> 00:15:37,927
Well, uh, from what Dave told me,

373
00:15:38,004 --> 00:15:41,222
the last thing I remember is from...

374
00:15:41,299 --> 00:15:42,932
around two years ago.

375
00:15:43,009 --> 00:15:44,267
That's right.

376
00:15:44,343 --> 00:15:45,601
Well done.

377
00:15:45,678 --> 00:15:47,562
Is this normal amnesia protocol?

378
00:15:47,638 --> 00:15:49,605
It's more post-protocol banter.

379
00:15:49,682 --> 00:15:51,774
Good morning, Doctor.

380
00:15:51,851 --> 00:15:54,152
Oh, it's you.

381
00:15:54,162 --> 00:15:56,112
Lovely to see you again.

382
00:15:56,189 --> 00:15:57,572
Mrs. Van Kirk.

383
00:15:57,648 --> 00:15:59,407
You know my doctor?

384
00:16:00,381 --> 00:16:01,384
Yes, I do.

385
00:16:01,394 --> 00:16:02,952
Very well.

386
00:16:03,029 --> 00:16:04,912
Actually,
could I see you outside for a sec?

387
00:16:04,989 --> 00:16:06,197
Uh, I'm an adult.

388
00:16:06,199 --> 00:16:08,791
I'd rather you talk
about me in front of me.

389
00:16:08,868 --> 00:16:10,293
Don't be silly.

390
00:16:10,369 --> 00:16:11,919
I don't keep secrets from my boy.

391
00:16:11,996 --> 00:16:14,630
I promise I'll fill
you in on everything.

392
00:16:14,707 --> 00:16:17,300
Well, maybe not everything.

393
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:28,770
I heard something about you,
Blake Carrington.

394
00:16:29,973 --> 00:16:32,482
Well... that doesn't mean it's true.

395
00:16:32,558 --> 00:16:34,358
Yeah, well,
I heard is that you're the man

396
00:16:34,369 --> 00:16:36,703
responsible for the porterhouse
steaks we had for dinner.

397
00:16:38,523 --> 00:16:41,032
Best steak I ever had in my life.

398
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:45,536
Well, no problem, gentlemen.

399
00:16:45,547 --> 00:16:47,288
Just made a phone call to a friend.

400
00:16:47,365 --> 00:16:49,457
Seemed like the right thing to do.

401
00:16:49,468 --> 00:16:51,301
We're all in here together.

402
00:16:51,377 --> 00:16:53,628
No reason to live like animals.

403
00:16:53,704 --> 00:16:55,305
Very kind of you, sir.

404
00:16:58,751 --> 00:17:00,101
You have a nice evening.

405
00:17:10,405 --> 00:17:12,480
Rick?

406
00:17:12,557 --> 00:17:13,923
Hi.

407
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,575
Hi.

408
00:17:15,652 --> 00:17:18,236
You're even better looking
than your profile pic.

409
00:17:18,246 --> 00:17:19,695
Thank you.

410
00:17:19,772 --> 00:17:21,206
I could say the same about you.

411
00:17:21,282 --> 00:17:25,576
Which is unheard of on
a dating app these days.

412
00:17:25,587 --> 00:17:28,755
So I guess this is where
you offer to buy me a drink.

413
00:17:28,832 --> 00:17:30,590
I'll have an old-fashioned.

414
00:17:30,667 --> 00:17:32,083
My tab.

415
00:17:32,093 --> 00:17:34,093
Let me ask you a question, Rick.

416
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:35,878
Hmm?

417
00:17:35,955 --> 00:17:38,714
You ever find yourself in the mood

418
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:40,675
you don't want to be alone?

419
00:17:40,751 --> 00:17:43,386
You're looking for someone
special to keep you company?

420
00:17:43,462 --> 00:17:46,097
I'm in one of those moods right now.

421
00:17:46,107 --> 00:17:50,443
Look at us. Two special souls.

422
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,654
I wonder what else we have in common.

423
00:17:54,974 --> 00:17:58,568
Did someone order the
pan-seared Chilean sea bass?

424
00:17:58,644 --> 00:18:00,444
Fallon? Whoa, what?

425
00:18:00,455 --> 00:18:01,863
I mean, I didn't.

426
00:18:01,939 --> 00:18:03,188
Well, that's the charm of my service.

427
00:18:03,266 --> 00:18:05,074
I deliver it before you
even know you want it.

428
00:18:05,151 --> 00:18:06,617
You really shouldn't have done all this.

429
00:18:06,628 --> 00:18:09,579
Full confession,
I've basically taken a micro-course

430
00:18:09,655 --> 00:18:12,081
in retrograde amnesia
over the past few days,

431
00:18:12,158 --> 00:18:14,250
and stimulating sense memory is
supposed to be the best cure.

432
00:18:14,327 --> 00:18:15,918
Does this mean I don't get to eat it?

433
00:18:15,995 --> 00:18:18,588
No, no, no, not yet. Just smell.

434
00:18:18,664 --> 00:18:22,216
Chilean sea bass is the
first meal you cooked for me.

435
00:18:22,293 --> 00:18:25,303
You know? That's right.
Yeah. Breathe it in.

436
00:18:25,313 --> 00:18:26,688
Mm.

437
00:18:26,764 --> 00:18:28,556
- That smells amazing.
- Yeah.

438
00:18:28,633 --> 00:18:30,391
It was very sweet.
You came over to the manor

439
00:18:30,468 --> 00:18:31,484
and cooked it for me.

440
00:18:31,561 --> 00:18:32,935
It was very romantic.

441
00:18:33,012 --> 00:18:35,438
Sorry, I'm not really
remembering anything.

442
00:18:35,514 --> 00:18:36,606
Other than being hungry.

443
00:18:36,682 --> 00:18:37,899
So can I eat this now?

444
00:18:37,975 --> 00:18:39,442
No, no, no, no, no. Uh, not yet.

445
00:18:39,518 --> 00:18:41,777
- First, phase two.
- Whoa.

446
00:18:41,854 --> 00:18:43,446
Is this like some sort
of Dracula fetish?

447
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:45,948
No, it's-it's rose water.
It's your favorite.

448
00:18:46,025 --> 00:18:47,700
Come on, just sniff. Sniff my neck.

449
00:18:47,777 --> 00:18:49,619
- Seriously?
- Yes. It's science.

450
00:18:49,695 --> 00:18:50,967
Hey, okay.

451
00:18:52,531 --> 00:18:55,049
No, I'm still picking up sea bass.

452
00:19:00,095 --> 00:19:01,194
Now?

453
00:19:04,928 --> 00:19:06,853
Yeah.

454
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:08,521
It's actually quite nice.

455
00:19:08,598 --> 00:19:10,306
So it's working?

456
00:19:10,383 --> 00:19:12,183
Something's working.

457
00:19:12,193 --> 00:19:14,583
Oh, what on earth?

458
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,938
It smells like a fish brothel in here.

459
00:19:17,014 --> 00:19:19,190
Okay, you just insulted
everyone in here,

460
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,524
including the bass.

461
00:19:20,535 --> 00:19:22,318
Take your bass and leave.

462
00:19:22,395 --> 00:19:24,654
Ooh, I could do that, or I could stay.

463
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:26,614
I'm torn, Laura,
but I think I'm gonna stay.

464
00:19:26,691 --> 00:19:28,324
I see.

465
00:19:28,401 --> 00:19:31,160
I need security in here immediately!

466
00:19:31,237 --> 00:19:32,361
Security!

467
00:19:32,439 --> 00:19:33,829
Okay, don't pay attention to that, okay?

468
00:19:33,906 --> 00:19:35,665
We were engaged, okay? I mean...

469
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:37,166
remember, I proposed to you?

470
00:19:37,243 --> 00:19:39,293
In a rowboat on Lake Carrington.

471
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:40,670
I even used your father's ring.

472
00:19:40,746 --> 00:19:45,049
Oh, you mean this ring...

473
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:47,060
that I have worn around
my neck every day

474
00:19:47,136 --> 00:19:50,054
since Liam's father died?

475
00:19:50,065 --> 00:19:54,183
You just have to make things up,
don't you?

476
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:56,185
Liam, Liam, please, okay?

477
00:19:56,262 --> 00:19:58,646
We were, we were married,
and then divorced.

478
00:19:58,723 --> 00:20:00,690
And then engaged, with that ring, okay.

479
00:20:00,766 --> 00:20:02,316
I know it sounds ridiculous,

480
00:20:02,393 --> 00:20:03,859
but how could I make
something like that up?

481
00:20:03,936 --> 00:20:04,986
I am not that creative.

482
00:20:05,062 --> 00:20:06,529
Please, you have to trust me.

483
00:20:06,605 --> 00:20:08,197
I-I don't know what to say.

484
00:20:08,274 --> 00:20:10,157
Finally. Would you please escort

485
00:20:10,234 --> 00:20:12,368
- this madwoman out?
- No, no, no.

486
00:20:12,445 --> 00:20:13,586
You don't have to do that,

487
00:20:13,663 --> 00:20:16,539
because today,
everybody makes their own choices.

488
00:20:16,615 --> 00:20:18,374
This is family-only visiting hours,

489
00:20:18,451 --> 00:20:19,917
and she is definitely not family.

490
00:20:19,928 --> 00:20:21,719
No, don't come near me. No, get away.

491
00:20:21,796 --> 00:20:23,304
Get away from me. Away, away.

492
00:20:23,381 --> 00:20:24,847
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
- Ah! Oh!

493
00:20:24,924 --> 00:20:26,048
Inhale, Liam, okay?

494
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:27,508
Let the rose water bring you back.

495
00:20:27,585 --> 00:20:29,427
Do something, do something.
I want her out!

496
00:20:30,192 --> 00:20:31,662
- Come on, ma'am.
- Out!

497
00:20:38,137 --> 00:20:39,237
Get out!

498
00:20:39,313 --> 00:20:40,813
Okay, okay.

499
00:20:40,824 --> 00:20:42,023
Here, just eat the fish, okay?

500
00:20:42,099 --> 00:20:43,399
Eat the bass.
It'll bring you back, okay?

501
00:20:43,476 --> 00:20:44,567
- The fish will work.
- Let's go. Come on.

502
00:20:45,502 --> 00:20:47,403
- Good night, dear.
- Laura!

503
00:20:47,414 --> 00:20:49,664
Kiss my bass.

504
00:20:58,374 --> 00:21:00,299
Kirby?

505
00:21:00,376 --> 00:21:02,293
Funny seeing you here.

506
00:21:03,337 --> 00:21:04,486
Funny?

507
00:21:04,512 --> 00:21:06,756
I think maybe something
got lost in translation.

508
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:09,592
Hey, are you good?

509
00:21:09,668 --> 00:21:11,469
No. I'm angry.

510
00:21:11,479 --> 00:21:14,388
Because of Kirby?
You got nothing to worry about.

511
00:21:14,465 --> 00:21:15,556
Not Kirby.

512
00:21:15,567 --> 00:21:17,567
I'm angry about this.

513
00:21:17,643 --> 00:21:20,770
You and I have sacrificed so much.
And for what?

514
00:21:21,377 --> 00:21:23,825
For your son to come in behind
my back and take charge?

515
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:26,150
- Adam?
- After everything we discussed,

516
00:21:26,161 --> 00:21:28,819
he shut me out of the board
meeting for the winery.

517
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:31,405
He's the new CEO.

518
00:21:31,482 --> 00:21:32,907
Really?

519
00:21:32,983 --> 00:21:34,617
Are you kidding me right now?

520
00:21:34,693 --> 00:21:35,993
You're happy about this?

521
00:21:36,004 --> 00:21:37,453
No, no. I'm not happy

522
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:39,497
that he excluded you.

523
00:21:39,507 --> 00:21:40,998
But I am proud that he's finally showing

524
00:21:41,075 --> 00:21:42,500
a little Carrington blood.

525
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:45,586
I was beginning to think
he was a little too soft.

526
00:21:45,663 --> 00:21:47,254
- You don't get it.
- No.

527
00:21:47,265 --> 00:21:48,573
I don't care.

528
00:21:48,575 --> 00:21:50,633
Because at the end of the day,
I'm in charge.

529
00:21:50,709 --> 00:21:52,760
I need to get out of here,
so when is that gonna happen?

530
00:21:52,837 --> 00:21:54,845
I talked to a few people
about the bail hearing.

531
00:21:54,856 --> 00:21:56,080
And it looks good,

532
00:21:56,082 --> 00:21:58,474
but you may end up
owing a lot of favors.

533
00:21:59,381 --> 00:22:01,977
Just hold on for one more night.

534
00:22:02,054 --> 00:22:03,312
Can you?

535
00:22:03,323 --> 00:22:05,314
Hey.

536
00:22:05,391 --> 00:22:07,149
Don't worry. I'm fine.

537
00:22:07,226 --> 00:22:10,319
The people in here like me.
What can I say?

538
00:22:10,396 --> 00:22:13,280
I'm always the most popular
man wherever I end up, huh?

539
00:22:13,357 --> 00:22:14,958
It's a curse, really.

540
00:22:15,014 --> 00:22:17,168
Look, I'm sorry for shutting you down

541
00:22:17,245 --> 00:22:18,377
when you tried to help bail me out.

542
00:22:21,285 --> 00:22:22,164
Hello?

543
00:22:22,241 --> 00:22:25,760
Are you even listening to me or
would you rather go visit Blake?

544
00:22:25,837 --> 00:22:29,672
I'm sorry.
I just, um, I hate what they did to you.

545
00:22:29,748 --> 00:22:32,675
And, uh, I haven't really
been sleeping well, so...

546
00:22:32,751 --> 00:22:35,010
Yeah, me, neither.

547
00:22:35,087 --> 00:22:37,555
Never thought I'd miss
my pillow this much.

548
00:22:38,495 --> 00:22:40,733
Well... if, uh,

549
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:43,519
if you wanted,
I could go and check on it,

550
00:22:43,596 --> 00:22:45,521
make sure it's okay.

551
00:22:45,532 --> 00:22:47,857
They kicked me out of the manor.

552
00:22:47,867 --> 00:22:49,534
So, you don't have a place to live?

553
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:52,987
Mm-hmm. That's, um, partly why I'm here.

554
00:22:53,063 --> 00:22:55,239
Kirby, you can crash at my place.

555
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:56,866
- Really?
- Yeah.

556
00:22:56,942 --> 00:22:58,826
I'm not using it.

557
00:22:58,903 --> 00:23:01,087
Oh, my God, thank you.
I'll take care of everything.

558
00:23:01,164 --> 00:23:02,538
I mean, I'll water your plants.

559
00:23:02,615 --> 00:23:04,415
Do you even have plants?
'Cause if you don't,

560
00:23:04,425 --> 00:23:06,208
I'll get plants,
and then I'll water them.

561
00:23:08,205 --> 00:23:09,929
I swear, the universe is playing

562
00:23:10,006 --> 00:23:12,548
some sick,
karmic joke on me as punishment.

563
00:23:12,625 --> 00:23:14,383
I mean, the Trixie stuff was bad,

564
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:16,927
and then I had to deal with Ashley,
but saddling me

565
00:23:16,938 --> 00:23:18,128
with Laura Van Kirk?

566
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:19,722
I mean, really? It's just too much.

567
00:23:20,795 --> 00:23:23,407
And I know that Adam gave her
that ring back, and I know

568
00:23:23,442 --> 00:23:24,518
I can't get her to admit it

569
00:23:24,595 --> 00:23:26,395
and I know I won't be able to prove it.

570
00:23:26,472 --> 00:23:30,116
Have you thought about
maybe just giving up,

571
00:23:30,193 --> 00:23:34,695
and trying things fresh in,
like, three to five years?

572
00:23:34,772 --> 00:23:36,405
Aren't you being sentenced soon?

573
00:23:36,482 --> 00:23:37,573
I-I'm just trying to remind you

574
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:39,183
of the time factor.

575
00:23:39,185 --> 00:23:41,952
Yes, I am well aware of the time factor.
It's just that...

576
00:23:41,963 --> 00:23:44,121
I keep looking into Liam's eyes

577
00:23:44,132 --> 00:23:47,416
and searching for some glimmer of us,
and there is nothing.

578
00:23:47,493 --> 00:23:49,418
And I-I don't know what to do.

579
00:23:49,495 --> 00:23:51,304
Well, maybe you have
to think outside the box.

580
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:55,049
This is not your everyday
"amnesia boy meets rich girl

581
00:23:55,125 --> 00:23:56,634
for the second time" story,

582
00:23:56,644 --> 00:23:58,644
this is Fallon and Liam
we're talking about.

583
00:23:58,721 --> 00:24:00,971
Your relationship has always been epic.

584
00:24:01,714 --> 00:24:03,265
Epic is a strong word.

585
00:24:03,342 --> 00:24:05,563
Fine, let's call it crazy, then.

586
00:24:05,598 --> 00:24:07,937
I mean, you-you married the guy
when he was a total stranger

587
00:24:08,013 --> 00:24:10,314
to avoid marrying your cousin.

588
00:24:10,325 --> 00:24:13,150
To be fair, I did not know that
Jeff was my cousin at the time.

589
00:24:13,161 --> 00:24:16,323
Look, all I'm saying is,
if you want to make Liam remember you,

590
00:24:16,358 --> 00:24:18,322
you're gonna have to
be as unconventional

591
00:24:18,333 --> 00:24:19,707
as your relationship was.

592
00:24:19,784 --> 00:24:20,991
Sorry, "is."

593
00:24:22,018 --> 00:24:23,285
You are totally right.

594
00:24:23,362 --> 00:24:26,830
I'm a Carrington.
Of course I'm gonna do something epic.

595
00:24:50,129 --> 00:24:51,480
- Hey.
- Hey...

596
00:24:51,557 --> 00:24:53,783
- Is there a problem?
- Oh, there's a big problem.

597
00:24:53,859 --> 00:24:56,151
You think one steak is gonna
make you part of a crew?

598
00:24:56,228 --> 00:24:57,828
You think that gets you set in here?

599
00:24:58,883 --> 00:24:59,963
All right, let me make some calls.

600
00:24:59,974 --> 00:25:02,491
You got any allergies to shellfish?

601
00:25:02,568 --> 00:25:06,754
Culhane was right about you,
and everybody in here knows it.

602
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:16,046
Is your life so pathetic

603
00:25:16,057 --> 00:25:17,265
that you have to work this hard

604
00:25:17,341 --> 00:25:19,800
to manipulate everyone
in here to hating me?

605
00:25:19,877 --> 00:25:21,302
I didn't have to try very hard at all.

606
00:25:21,312 --> 00:25:24,221
Just had to tell them
who you really are.

607
00:25:24,232 --> 00:25:27,016
That you see me,
them and every other human being

608
00:25:27,092 --> 00:25:30,019
as pawns you can buy or sell.

609
00:25:30,095 --> 00:25:31,687
See, now, that's spoken like a true pawn

610
00:25:31,764 --> 00:25:33,647
who wishes he had the power of a king.

611
00:25:33,724 --> 00:25:36,150
Mm, I don't want to be a king

612
00:25:36,226 --> 00:25:38,360
if it makes me anything like you.

613
00:25:38,437 --> 00:25:40,121
I'd rather be a man.

614
00:25:42,107 --> 00:25:45,367
You'll never be a man, Culhane.

615
00:25:45,444 --> 00:25:47,077
Because no matter how many
times I ruin your life,

616
00:25:47,088 --> 00:25:49,747
you just keep crawling back for more.

617
00:25:49,823 --> 00:25:51,540
Now, you would've thought
that my poisoning your father

618
00:25:51,617 --> 00:25:53,584
would've done the trick, but no.

619
00:25:53,594 --> 00:25:55,210
Nah, I guess not, huh?

620
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:01,809
Get...

621
00:26:21,014 --> 00:26:22,571
Hey.

622
00:26:23,323 --> 00:26:25,115
Touch me again and I'll destroy you.

623
00:26:25,838 --> 00:26:26,959
What are you gonna do?

624
00:26:27,036 --> 00:26:29,181
Bring Anders in here to beat me up?

625
00:26:29,613 --> 00:26:32,539
We both know you don't have the
guts to do anything yourself.

626
00:26:32,616 --> 00:26:35,250
You just keep pushing me, Culhane.
You'll find out.

627
00:26:35,327 --> 00:26:37,252
Please.

628
00:26:37,329 --> 00:26:39,797
You talk tough like a man,
but we both know

629
00:26:39,807 --> 00:26:41,465
you're just a little boy

630
00:26:41,476 --> 00:26:43,926
who inherited everything he ever got.

631
00:26:44,002 --> 00:26:46,687
A little boy afraid to
get his hands dirty.

632
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,766
Oh, no, they're plenty dirty.

633
00:26:50,843 --> 00:26:52,935
I'd tell you to ask Mack,
but see, these hands,

634
00:26:53,011 --> 00:26:55,062
they took care of that problem.

635
00:26:55,139 --> 00:26:57,439
So unless you want to end up
at the bottom of the lake,

636
00:26:57,516 --> 00:26:59,867
your better shut your mouth.

637
00:27:08,836 --> 00:27:10,494
I want it to look authentic,

638
00:27:10,496 --> 00:27:12,955
but make sure my shoulders
are rippling under the jacket.

639
00:27:13,031 --> 00:27:16,625
People in the future should
know I worked out, a lot.

640
00:27:16,702 --> 00:27:17,960
Before you say anything judgmental,

641
00:27:18,036 --> 00:27:20,754
or even think anything judgmental...

642
00:27:20,831 --> 00:27:22,631
Thoughts are already forming.

643
00:27:22,708 --> 00:27:25,426
If I'm going to capitalize
on the history of this place,

644
00:27:25,502 --> 00:27:27,761
I got to, well, party like McCarty.

645
00:27:27,838 --> 00:27:29,346
I admire your enthusiasm.

646
00:27:29,423 --> 00:27:30,839
Uhp, just wait.

647
00:27:30,917 --> 00:27:33,976
For media day, I'm planning
to unveil this portrait of me

648
00:27:34,052 --> 00:27:36,437
right next to that portrait of Bernard

649
00:27:36,513 --> 00:27:39,273
in our newly named McCarty's Lounge.

650
00:27:39,349 --> 00:27:42,651
Is there anything else I ought
to know as your number two?

651
00:27:42,728 --> 00:27:44,987
Uh, yes. I'm also having
the McCarty insignia

652
00:27:45,063 --> 00:27:46,321
printed everywhere.

653
00:27:46,398 --> 00:27:49,158
Napkins, umbrellas, toast.

654
00:27:49,234 --> 00:27:51,702
Your ingenuity is admirable.

655
00:27:51,712 --> 00:27:54,329
But? There's always a but with you.

656
00:27:54,406 --> 00:27:59,001
Well, there is this curious RSVP
we received to your media day

657
00:27:59,077 --> 00:28:01,887
from a member of the McCarty family.

658
00:28:01,964 --> 00:28:04,214
Uh... bah-bah, blah, blah, blah...

659
00:28:04,225 --> 00:28:07,134
"...surprised to get your invite.

660
00:28:07,211 --> 00:28:10,512
"I am shocked you are
celebrating my horr...

661
00:28:10,589 --> 00:28:13,140
"my horrible great-grandfather,

662
00:28:13,217 --> 00:28:17,236
and wouldn't be caught
dead there. Pass."

663
00:28:19,991 --> 00:28:23,859
So... she sounds nice.

664
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:25,777
Nothing about this feels right.

665
00:28:25,854 --> 00:28:27,746
I know. Just give me one hour

666
00:28:27,823 --> 00:28:29,865
to prove to you that I'm
not an insane person.

667
00:28:29,942 --> 00:28:31,867
Well, you're kidnapping
me from a hospital, so...

668
00:28:31,944 --> 00:28:34,336
The hour doesn't start
until we cross the street.

669
00:28:37,383 --> 00:28:40,375
Even when we get bail,
this case isn't going away.

670
00:28:40,452 --> 00:28:43,754
They may ask you to
testify against Blake.

671
00:28:43,764 --> 00:28:46,140
All rise.

672
00:28:48,698 --> 00:28:50,052
Okay, let's move this along.

673
00:28:50,128 --> 00:28:51,929
Mr. Carrington.

674
00:28:51,939 --> 00:28:53,981
On the charge of murder,
how do you plead?

675
00:28:54,058 --> 00:28:57,610
Oh, uh, not guilty, Your Honor.

676
00:28:59,137 --> 00:29:00,562
Very well.

677
00:29:00,639 --> 00:29:02,397
Due to additional evidence that has come

678
00:29:02,474 --> 00:29:06,443
to the court's attention,
your request for bail is denied.

679
00:29:08,072 --> 00:29:09,538
I'm remanding you back into custody.

680
00:29:09,615 --> 00:29:12,282
Evidentiary hearing dates
will be set next week.

681
00:29:12,359 --> 00:29:13,951
We're adjourned.

682
00:29:14,827 --> 00:29:16,854
- What the hell?
- That's impossible.

683
00:29:16,856 --> 00:29:19,006
You can't let them take him back there!

684
00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:21,500
Mitchell, do something.

685
00:29:21,577 --> 00:29:23,511
It's okay.

686
00:29:29,126 --> 00:29:33,095
So glad I could be here for this.

687
00:29:34,673 --> 00:29:38,058
Did I forget to mention that
Joey is an undercover agent?

688
00:29:38,135 --> 00:29:40,227
You see,
I made a little deal with the Feds.

689
00:29:40,238 --> 00:29:43,146
"Get Blake to admit his guilt,
we'll let you walk."

690
00:29:43,157 --> 00:29:45,774
You talked, so I'm walking.

691
00:29:45,851 --> 00:29:48,160
You just made a huge mistake.

692
00:29:48,237 --> 00:29:50,204
Yeah. We'll see about that.

693
00:29:57,904 --> 00:30:02,499
Okay. You were standing right there,

694
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:05,502
carrying a motorcycle helmet.

695
00:30:05,513 --> 00:30:07,388
I rode a motorcycle?

696
00:30:09,041 --> 00:30:12,467
Yeah. I kind of remember that.

697
00:30:13,050 --> 00:30:15,274
And? That's it?

698
00:30:15,309 --> 00:30:17,806
I mean, you totally
started to flirt with me.

699
00:30:17,883 --> 00:30:19,692
One thing led to another,
and then before you know it,

700
00:30:19,768 --> 00:30:21,435
we were in there in that courthouse,

701
00:30:21,511 --> 00:30:23,145
about to sign on the dotted line.

702
00:30:23,221 --> 00:30:24,980
Oh, and one more thing.

703
00:30:25,057 --> 00:30:27,816
I am wearing the exact same dress,

704
00:30:27,893 --> 00:30:31,194
which is a huge fashion risk,
since it's two seasons old.

705
00:30:32,156 --> 00:30:33,196
I like it.

706
00:30:33,207 --> 00:30:34,990
Well, of course you do.

707
00:30:35,067 --> 00:30:37,659
Because we belong together, Liam.

708
00:30:37,736 --> 00:30:40,954
And we have ever since we met,
at this spot.

709
00:30:42,441 --> 00:30:44,166
I wish you knew how much this
was killing me right now,

710
00:30:44,242 --> 00:30:48,262
because I really,
really, really miss you.

711
00:31:08,941 --> 00:31:10,734
Were you wearing a different color hat?

712
00:31:11,685 --> 00:31:13,528
Yes. Yes, I was.

713
00:31:13,605 --> 00:31:15,197
It was white.

714
00:31:15,273 --> 00:31:17,074
Do you remember that?

715
00:31:17,898 --> 00:31:19,826
Unbelievable.

716
00:31:20,916 --> 00:31:23,205
Kidnapping? Truly?

717
00:31:23,281 --> 00:31:25,999
Is there any line that you won't cross?

718
00:31:26,076 --> 00:31:28,001
Do you have a tracker on me?

719
00:31:28,078 --> 00:31:29,252
Don't be ridiculous.

720
00:31:29,329 --> 00:31:30,804
I have a tracker on him.

721
00:31:38,108 --> 00:31:41,390
What on earth compelled you
to take Liam out of that safe

722
00:31:41,466 --> 00:31:44,559
and-and clean hospital room
into this filthy street?

723
00:31:44,636 --> 00:31:45,936
Honestly, Fallon,

724
00:31:45,946 --> 00:31:47,646
from this stunt to that hat,

725
00:31:47,657 --> 00:31:49,448
you're a poor decision maker.

726
00:31:49,525 --> 00:31:50,941
Liam never shared with you the details

727
00:31:50,951 --> 00:31:52,609
of the night we met?

728
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:54,945
That's funny,
I thought you two were close.

729
00:31:54,955 --> 00:31:58,865
Well, I guess he didn't think
it was a significant event.

730
00:31:58,942 --> 00:32:00,283
- We're leaving.
- No, no, no, no.

731
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:01,745
Not so fast.

732
00:32:04,323 --> 00:32:06,289
- You!
- I got it.

733
00:32:06,366 --> 00:32:07,508
- No, no.
- Yes, I got it.

734
00:32:08,894 --> 00:32:09,918
- No!
- No!

735
00:32:09,929 --> 00:32:11,461
- No. Oh!
- No.

736
00:32:13,165 --> 00:32:15,048
- Stop it.
- Give it to me. Leave him alone!

737
00:32:15,125 --> 00:32:16,633
- Stop it.
- No. You stop it.

738
00:32:16,644 --> 00:32:18,301
- You let go!
- You let go!

739
00:32:18,378 --> 00:32:20,020
- Stop it! Stop it!
- Leave him alone.

740
00:32:21,607 --> 00:32:22,856
- Stop!
- Oh...

741
00:32:25,177 --> 00:32:26,268
Both of you!

742
00:32:27,134 --> 00:32:28,603
Liam, will you please tell your mother

743
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:31,148
that you remember<i> something</i>
about the night we met.

744
00:32:31,158 --> 00:32:34,109
Maybe I did. I don't know.

745
00:32:34,186 --> 00:32:36,570
I believe what you're saying, I do.

746
00:32:36,646 --> 00:32:38,447
But sitting here watching
you fight with my mother

747
00:32:38,523 --> 00:32:40,457
isn't gonna bring my
memory back any faster.

748
00:32:40,534 --> 00:32:42,993
Don't beat yourself up
too badly, Fallon.

749
00:32:43,003 --> 00:32:45,045
Just enough!

750
00:32:45,122 --> 00:32:46,839
I can tell it's important to you

751
00:32:46,915 --> 00:32:49,291
that I remember our relationship.

752
00:32:49,367 --> 00:32:51,793
I'm afraid my memory
might never come back.

753
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:53,011
And the pressure you're putting on me

754
00:32:53,088 --> 00:32:55,130
is kind of freaking me out.

755
00:32:55,207 --> 00:32:57,891
So can you please just stop?

756
00:33:01,195 --> 00:33:02,679
So, the media day I have planned

757
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:04,514
is to celebrate my connection

758
00:33:04,525 --> 00:33:06,308
to your great-grandfather's legacy.

759
00:33:06,384 --> 00:33:09,269
And I was hoping that
you could set aside

760
00:33:09,346 --> 00:33:11,104
your personal differences with him

761
00:33:11,181 --> 00:33:13,815
and be a part of the festivities.

762
00:33:13,892 --> 00:33:17,694
Did he kick you out of
the will or something?

763
00:33:17,705 --> 00:33:19,362
This is not about money.

764
00:33:19,373 --> 00:33:21,823
I can't believe you, of all people,

765
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:23,158
are honoring him. I mean...

766
00:33:23,235 --> 00:33:25,377
I follow you on Instagram, and I assumed

767
00:33:25,454 --> 00:33:27,120
you'd be all about gay rights.

768
00:33:27,197 --> 00:33:28,580
What are you talking about?

769
00:33:28,657 --> 00:33:31,666
I am all about gay rights.
Every day is Pride for me.

770
00:33:32,766 --> 00:33:35,003
My great-grandfather
Bernard was an advocate

771
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,546
for gay conversion therapy.

772
00:33:36,557 --> 00:33:39,174
He refused to serve or hire gay people

773
00:33:39,251 --> 00:33:40,634
at any of his hotels.

774
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:43,604
An "abomination," he called us.

775
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:48,850
Uh... I'm so sorry.

776
00:33:48,927 --> 00:33:53,313
I... I obviously had no
idea about any of this.

777
00:33:54,172 --> 00:33:56,650
Yeah, well,
it's not on his Wikipedia page.

778
00:33:56,726 --> 00:33:59,861
So you're telling me that
the whole city is invited

779
00:33:59,938 --> 00:34:03,907
to my hotel to commemorate
a famous homophobe?

780
00:34:04,956 --> 00:34:06,293
Pretty much.

781
00:34:09,281 --> 00:34:11,008
Well, that's not great.

782
00:34:11,333 --> 00:34:13,542
<i>I have made many</i>

783
00:34:13,618 --> 00:34:15,928
bad choices in my life, Your Honor.

784
00:34:16,004 --> 00:34:19,923
I really can't say which
consequences are fair or just,

785
00:34:19,934 --> 00:34:22,175
but I am ready to atone.

786
00:34:23,075 --> 00:34:25,846
Ms. Carrington,
you are a woman of exceptional means

787
00:34:25,922 --> 00:34:28,273
and what many people
believe is extreme influence

788
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:30,225
in certain parts of this county.

789
00:34:30,302 --> 00:34:32,435
But rather than lock those assets up,

790
00:34:32,446 --> 00:34:34,896
I'm gonna make an example
of you and put them to use.

791
00:34:34,973 --> 00:34:38,608
I'm sentencing you to 100
hours of community service.

792
00:34:38,619 --> 00:34:39,776
I strongly suggest

793
00:34:39,787 --> 00:34:42,070
you use your means and influence

794
00:34:42,147 --> 00:34:45,073
for the good of this community
and not for yourself.

795
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:46,500
You're dismissed.

796
00:34:47,628 --> 00:34:49,119
Thank you, Your Honor.

797
00:34:49,129 --> 00:34:52,581
Wow. That's unbelievable.

798
00:34:52,657 --> 00:34:54,249
You got off easy, to say the least.

799
00:34:54,943 --> 00:34:56,418
Easy?

800
00:34:56,428 --> 00:35:00,088
I am off to the hospital
to visit my fiancé,

801
00:35:00,165 --> 00:35:02,641
who almost died, has no memory of me,

802
00:35:02,718 --> 00:35:05,093
and now thinks he's in
love with another woman.

803
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:07,354
Nothing is easy for me right now.

804
00:35:17,658 --> 00:35:20,367
Carrington, come with me.

805
00:35:30,987 --> 00:35:34,923
Blake Carrington, will you marry me?

806
00:35:52,003 --> 00:35:53,011
I do.

807
00:35:53,694 --> 00:35:55,977
I do.

808
00:36:09,067 --> 00:36:11,785
Okay, now, wrap it up so I
can return you to your cell

809
00:36:11,861 --> 00:36:13,995
and get to the women's jail.

810
00:36:14,072 --> 00:36:15,330
Back-to-back ceremonies.

811
00:36:15,407 --> 00:36:17,290
And lose the boutonniere.

812
00:36:17,367 --> 00:36:19,125
I mean, unless you want
someone to stab you with it

813
00:36:19,202 --> 00:36:21,294
in your sleep.

814
00:36:21,371 --> 00:36:22,429
And the ring.

815
00:36:24,541 --> 00:36:26,633
I got to get out of here.

816
00:36:26,644 --> 00:36:29,219
Have Mitchell appeal that
joke of a bail hearing

817
00:36:29,229 --> 00:36:30,512
and figure something out.

818
00:36:30,588 --> 00:36:33,348
I will.

819
00:36:33,425 --> 00:36:36,518
I will do whatever it
takes to get you out.

820
00:36:36,594 --> 00:36:40,855
You killed Mack for me.
I'll never forget that.

821
00:36:40,932 --> 00:36:42,574
I understand this sounds extreme,

822
00:36:42,651 --> 00:36:44,859
but in light of learning
that Bernard McCarty was

823
00:36:44,936 --> 00:36:47,195
a major homophobe, our only option is

824
00:36:47,272 --> 00:36:48,396
to cancel media day.

825
00:36:48,474 --> 00:36:50,615
Some things are better left in the past.

826
00:36:50,692 --> 00:36:53,034
Well, I-I am sympathetic to your plight,

827
00:36:53,111 --> 00:36:55,078
but the president
of the Historical Alliance

828
00:36:55,089 --> 00:36:57,414
has made this her grand
event of the year,

829
00:36:57,424 --> 00:37:00,926
and you do not want to
mess with the president.

830
00:37:01,003 --> 00:37:03,378
I don't think you understand
how deeply I oppose

831
00:37:03,455 --> 00:37:04,587
honoring this man.

832
00:37:04,598 --> 00:37:06,256
And if the president has a heart,

833
00:37:06,332 --> 00:37:08,049
I'm sure I can persuade her to cancel.

834
00:37:08,126 --> 00:37:10,593
She doesn't, and you won't.

835
00:37:10,604 --> 00:37:11,979
Sorry.

836
00:37:13,131 --> 00:37:15,223
Cristal.

837
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:16,558
I came right away.

838
00:37:16,634 --> 00:37:19,060
Why? I didn't ask you to.

839
00:37:19,137 --> 00:37:20,854
There's a leaked photo of Blake.

840
00:37:20,930 --> 00:37:23,231
- It's everywhere.
- What? Where is it?

841
00:37:23,308 --> 00:37:25,659
I just so happen to have it.

842
00:37:27,604 --> 00:37:29,237
Oh, this is bad.

843
00:37:29,314 --> 00:37:30,330
Yes, dear, I know.

844
00:37:30,407 --> 00:37:32,949
It's a PR nightmare. Can you imagine

845
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:35,118
all of the potential jurors seeing this?

846
00:37:35,129 --> 00:37:37,078
It's going to take
forever to find a jury

847
00:37:37,155 --> 00:37:38,163
who's not biased.

848
00:37:38,749 --> 00:37:39,914
The great news is

849
00:37:39,991 --> 00:37:42,083
I will happily take the reins

850
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:45,962
and handle the media, as a Carrington.

851
00:37:46,901 --> 00:37:49,049
That is so thoughtful of you, Dominique,

852
00:37:49,125 --> 00:37:52,218
but since Blake and I just got married,

853
00:37:52,229 --> 00:37:54,596
that makes me a Carrington, too.

854
00:37:54,672 --> 00:37:57,882
And a much more powerful one than you.

855
00:37:57,917 --> 00:38:00,226
So, thank you for your offer,

856
00:38:00,237 --> 00:38:02,195
but I've got it from here.

857
00:38:06,351 --> 00:38:08,068
Oh, my God, hi!

858
00:38:08,144 --> 00:38:10,153
Welcome home.

859
00:38:10,164 --> 00:38:12,614
I'm not sure whose home.

860
00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:15,617
Oh, oh, everything can be rearranged.

861
00:38:15,693 --> 00:38:17,327
I promise. It's just I needed,

862
00:38:17,337 --> 00:38:19,004
um, more room for my stuff,

863
00:38:19,081 --> 00:38:21,173
so I had to rearrange some things.

864
00:38:21,249 --> 00:38:22,665
And redecorate.

865
00:38:22,742 --> 00:38:25,251
Yeah, I-I got you a cactus,

866
00:38:25,328 --> 00:38:28,505
'cause I-I didn't know how long
you'd be staying in jail for.

867
00:38:28,515 --> 00:38:30,715
Oh, and-and this.

868
00:38:31,888 --> 00:38:32,926
That chessboard,

869
00:38:33,002 --> 00:38:35,595
- isn't it from Blake's study?
- Mm-hmm.

870
00:38:35,672 --> 00:38:37,514
I stole it.

871
00:38:37,524 --> 00:38:40,141
Like an-an eye-for-an-eye thing.

872
00:38:40,218 --> 00:38:41,359
For you.

873
00:38:41,436 --> 00:38:43,770
I'm not sure that taking his chessboard

874
00:38:43,847 --> 00:38:45,980
is the same as him getting me arrested,

875
00:38:46,057 --> 00:38:49,526
but I appreciate the effort.

876
00:38:53,656 --> 00:38:54,823
Should we play?

877
00:38:55,391 --> 00:38:56,950
Don't really know how.

878
00:38:58,611 --> 00:38:59,686
Me neither.

879
00:39:07,912 --> 00:39:09,629
Kirby, listen...

880
00:39:09,706 --> 00:39:11,005
Don't say it.

881
00:39:11,082 --> 00:39:13,058
I'm really sorry.

882
00:39:17,639 --> 00:39:19,255
Making yourself right at home.

883
00:39:19,257 --> 00:39:22,392
Well, in my father's absence,
which I do hope will be brief,

884
00:39:22,402 --> 00:39:24,185
I feel quite confident and comfortable

885
00:39:24,262 --> 00:39:25,570
steering the ship.

886
00:39:25,647 --> 00:39:29,074
That's so interesting,
because I feel quite confident

887
00:39:29,151 --> 00:39:32,694
that my husband wants his brand-new wife

888
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:34,404
to steer the ship.

889
00:39:34,414 --> 00:39:37,866
Well, I guess
congratulations are in order.

890
00:39:37,942 --> 00:39:41,086
Still, he hasn't told me, his son,

891
00:39:41,163 --> 00:39:43,088
what his wishes are,

892
00:39:43,165 --> 00:39:47,500
so until then,
I guess we should keep things

893
00:39:47,577 --> 00:39:48,677
the way they are?

894
00:39:50,514 --> 00:39:51,555
For now.

895
00:39:53,291 --> 00:39:55,008
Oh, and, um,

896
00:39:55,084 --> 00:39:56,685
if it makes you feel uncomfortable,

897
00:39:56,761 --> 00:39:58,979
you don't have to call me "Mommy."

898
00:40:04,069 --> 00:40:06,186
Ah, Fallon, I've been expecting you.

899
00:40:06,262 --> 00:40:07,520
I have a gift.

900
00:40:07,597 --> 00:40:10,690
Ah, let me guess. A restraining order?

901
00:40:10,767 --> 00:40:12,075
Did you peek?

902
00:40:12,152 --> 00:40:13,285
Seriously?

903
00:40:13,361 --> 00:40:16,279
Your outbursts against
me have become violent.

904
00:40:16,290 --> 00:40:18,072
And I don't feel safe.

905
00:40:18,149 --> 00:40:20,116
And apparently, the court agrees.

906
00:40:20,127 --> 00:40:22,294
Does the court know you are insane?

907
00:40:22,370 --> 00:40:24,704
And you are legally prohibited

908
00:40:24,781 --> 00:40:26,882
from coming within 50 feet of me,

909
00:40:26,958 --> 00:40:29,584
or Liam, whenever I'm with him,

910
00:40:29,661 --> 00:40:31,586
which will be constantly.

911
00:40:31,663 --> 00:40:33,963
No, no, no, no, no. You can't do this.

912
00:40:33,974 --> 00:40:37,759
This gentleman has a
digital measuring device

913
00:40:37,835 --> 00:40:40,094
that determines exactly 50 feet.

914
00:40:40,171 --> 00:40:41,763
So, whenever he activates it,

915
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:43,723
if you're within that range,

916
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,642
it will beep.

917
00:40:46,344 --> 00:40:47,410
Like that.

918
00:40:47,421 --> 00:40:49,437
Wait, it beeps just for me,

919
00:40:49,514 --> 00:40:51,481
or if anyone is within 50 feet?

920
00:40:51,491 --> 00:40:53,158
Well, it's-it's not foolproof.

921
00:40:53,235 --> 00:40:56,328
The point is, when he sees you,
he'll activate it.

922
00:40:56,404 --> 00:40:58,404
And if it beeps, then I have no choice

923
00:40:58,481 --> 00:41:00,498
but to report that to Judge Anson.

924
00:41:00,575 --> 00:41:03,076
And that will surely lead
to your community service

925
00:41:03,152 --> 00:41:05,411
being revoked, and then jail time.

926
00:41:05,488 --> 00:41:09,040
So, back it up, dear.

927
00:41:14,706 --> 00:41:15,964
More.

928
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,069
Okay.

929
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:20,018
Keep going.

930
00:41:21,072 --> 00:41:22,148
Further.

931
00:41:23,715 --> 00:41:25,181
All right, turn it off.

932
00:41:25,192 --> 00:41:26,522
It's giving me a headache.

933
00:41:27,385 --> 00:41:29,269
Get used to the distance, dear.

934
00:41:29,345 --> 00:41:32,146
You may have won the battle, Laura,

935
00:41:32,223 --> 00:41:33,815
but I will win the war.

936
00:41:33,891 --> 00:41:36,985
No, dear, you're losing everything.

937
00:41:38,249 --> 00:41:41,539
It may take Liam a while to
remember that he loves me,

938
00:41:41,616 --> 00:41:44,951
but it will only take
him a second to recall

939
00:41:45,028 --> 00:41:47,829
how fiercely he hates you.

940
00:41:47,905 --> 00:41:50,498
Which pales in comparison to how much

941
00:41:50,575 --> 00:41:52,458
I hate you right now.

942
00:41:52,535 --> 00:41:54,427
Beep you, bitch.

943
00:42:22,006 --> 00:42:24,133
