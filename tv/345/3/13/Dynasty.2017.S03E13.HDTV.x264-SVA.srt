1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,129
- <i>Previously on</i> Dynasty...
- Is this a bad idea?

2
00:00:02,153 --> 00:00:03,944
I'm in the mood for a bad idea.

3
00:00:04,074 --> 00:00:05,145
_

4
00:00:05,284 --> 00:00:07,405
_

5
00:00:07,575 --> 00:00:08,306
_

6
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,566
Fletcher is married.

7
00:00:09,643 --> 00:00:11,276
He was lying to me the
whole time we dated.

8
00:00:11,353 --> 00:00:12,694
What the hell are you doing here?

9
00:00:12,771 --> 00:00:13,829
Didn't Blake tell you?

10
00:00:13,906 --> 00:00:15,748
I'm moving in, dear.

11
00:00:27,126 --> 00:00:27,973
What the hell is this?

12
00:00:28,008 --> 00:00:29,962
Why are we having swamp
water for breakfast?

13
00:00:30,038 --> 00:00:31,463
And why don't I smell crepes?

14
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:32,848
Because you're smelling

15
00:00:32,925 --> 00:00:34,800
wellness!

16
00:00:34,876 --> 00:00:36,496
Good morning, roomies.

17
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:37,970
I thought a heart-healthy

18
00:00:38,046 --> 00:00:39,666
meal would be better for all of us.

19
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:42,441
Okay, I'd like to discuss
some house rules,

20
00:00:42,518 --> 00:00:45,861
since I wasn't exactly
consulted before your arrival.

21
00:00:45,938 --> 00:00:47,604
The deal we made for her getting me

22
00:00:47,681 --> 00:00:49,648
access to Jeff's office was one year,

23
00:00:49,725 --> 00:00:52,985
nonnegotiable,
but we will hardly see her,

24
00:00:53,061 --> 00:00:54,848
because she also agreed to
lay low in the east wing.

25
00:00:54,872 --> 00:00:57,184
Isn't that right, Dominique?
And I'll be sure

26
00:00:57,208 --> 00:00:58,727
to add an addendum
that you are no longer

27
00:00:58,751 --> 00:01:00,659
allowed to speak to the kitchen staff.

28
00:01:01,054 --> 00:01:02,119
Hmm. Oh!

29
00:01:02,195 --> 00:01:05,831
Excuse me,
I have a very important meeting.

30
00:01:05,907 --> 00:01:07,527
See? It's almost like I wasn't here.

31
00:01:07,551 --> 00:01:08,834
"Almost."

32
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:10,127
Wow.

33
00:01:10,203 --> 00:01:11,698
30 seconds in and I
already want to kill her.

34
00:01:11,722 --> 00:01:13,338
I don't know if I can make it a year.

35
00:01:13,415 --> 00:01:15,535
You are underestimating
how remarkable you are.

36
00:01:15,559 --> 00:01:17,009
If you could move past

37
00:01:17,085 --> 00:01:18,343
all that Alexis crap like you did,

38
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:19,895
Dominique will be a walk in the park.

39
00:01:20,631 --> 00:01:23,015
I don't like walking in
the park with a snake.

40
00:01:24,536 --> 00:01:25,537
I...

41
00:01:25,594 --> 00:01:27,172
I have to take this.

42
00:01:27,196 --> 00:01:29,688
I'll be right back.

43
00:01:35,937 --> 00:01:37,529
Gunnerson!

44
00:01:37,606 --> 00:01:39,865
Bring me some bacon!

45
00:01:39,941 --> 00:01:42,396
Liam, you and I have

46
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:44,064
endured and overcome

47
00:01:44,088 --> 00:01:46,330
so many insane obstacles.

48
00:01:46,406 --> 00:01:48,424
And by insane, I mean your mother.

49
00:01:49,392 --> 00:01:51,071
But I have never been more sure

50
00:01:51,095 --> 00:01:53,929
that I am ready to spend
the rest of my life

51
00:01:54,006 --> 00:01:56,765
by your side and in your arms.

52
00:01:57,522 --> 00:01:58,912
So, Liam...

53
00:01:59,593 --> 00:02:01,748
will you marry me?

54
00:02:01,772 --> 00:02:03,889
Yes, Liam will marry you.

55
00:02:03,965 --> 00:02:05,107
And if he doesn't, I will.

56
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:06,391
I mean, look at this ring.

57
00:02:06,468 --> 00:02:09,394
Aw, I am touched by your materialism.

58
00:02:09,471 --> 00:02:11,622
But I would lose the one
knee thing if I were you.

59
00:02:11,657 --> 00:02:12,259
It feels dated.

60
00:02:12,283 --> 00:02:14,261
What? No, no, there's no time to tinker.

61
00:02:14,285 --> 00:02:16,430
I am doing this at dinner tonight.

62
00:02:16,454 --> 00:02:18,265
Liam. Liam! Liam! Get rid of it.

63
00:02:18,289 --> 00:02:19,298
My mouth? Okay.

64
00:02:19,365 --> 00:02:20,572
What's better than a good sweat?

65
00:02:20,649 --> 00:02:22,124
Uh... aw, man.

66
00:02:22,201 --> 00:02:23,959
I can't think of anything better.

67
00:02:24,036 --> 00:02:25,911
I actually haven't
had a good sweat in ages.

68
00:02:25,987 --> 00:02:29,581
Hey, Siri, remind me to sweat later.

69
00:02:29,658 --> 00:02:30,549
- Good call.
- Yeah.

70
00:02:30,626 --> 00:02:32,189
You two seem weird.

71
00:02:32,224 --> 00:02:33,780
Weird? No...

72
00:02:34,286 --> 00:02:35,553
Excited, yes.

73
00:02:35,588 --> 00:02:36,252
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

74
00:02:36,287 --> 00:02:37,923
- About the hotel.
- It's, um...

75
00:02:37,999 --> 00:02:39,132
Sold out!

76
00:02:39,209 --> 00:02:40,384
- It's sold out for the...
- For the night.

77
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:41,643
...rest of the time.

78
00:02:42,805 --> 00:02:45,639
So, are we still on for tonight?

79
00:02:45,715 --> 00:02:48,462
Yes, we are, um,
but do you think you could possibly,

80
00:02:48,486 --> 00:02:50,464
I don't know, wash off the sweat

81
00:02:50,488 --> 00:02:51,728
- before then?
- Why?

82
00:02:51,805 --> 00:02:52,938
Why, you don't like this?

83
00:02:54,037 --> 00:02:55,469
No? Little bit?

84
00:02:55,493 --> 00:02:58,327
Okay.

85
00:02:58,404 --> 00:03:00,070
Whew! Okay, bye.

86
00:03:00,147 --> 00:03:01,747
No! Hey.

87
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:05,459
Fine.

88
00:03:09,915 --> 00:03:12,290
- Is that good?
- It's a little more aggressive than I'm used to.

89
00:03:12,367 --> 00:03:14,459
But I like it.

90
00:03:18,201 --> 00:03:20,327
- Hello, Mother.
- Shouldn't you knock before walking in

91
00:03:20,351 --> 00:03:22,329
on your mother with your stepfather?

92
00:03:23,322 --> 00:03:25,665
- Lesson learned.
- Still, what a pleasant surprise.

93
00:03:25,689 --> 00:03:27,022
Are you here for just a visit?

94
00:03:27,099 --> 00:03:29,941
- I doubt it.
- Are you hungry?

95
00:03:29,976 --> 00:03:32,144
Definitely not hungry, but, um...

96
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:33,437
I do need some help.

97
00:03:33,513 --> 00:03:35,647
Oh, well,
hold on while I look surprised.

98
00:03:35,724 --> 00:03:38,200
- What do you need?
- So, my license

99
00:03:38,277 --> 00:03:40,514
with the state medical
board is up for review,

100
00:03:40,538 --> 00:03:41,703
as it is every six months.

101
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:44,448
And Blake was making these...

102
00:03:44,524 --> 00:03:45,824
"donations"

103
00:03:45,901 --> 00:03:47,075
to keep it legit.

104
00:03:47,152 --> 00:03:49,327
By "donations," you mean "bribes"?

105
00:03:49,404 --> 00:03:52,831
Semantics, but now that I've
fallen out of favor with Father,

106
00:03:52,908 --> 00:03:54,528
those have stopped, so I...

107
00:03:56,465 --> 00:03:57,329
I need some money

108
00:03:57,364 --> 00:03:59,337
or I won't be able to practice
as a doctor in Atlanta.

109
00:03:59,414 --> 00:04:01,840
Well, sounds like a big win
for the patients of Atlanta.

110
00:04:03,084 --> 00:04:04,176
How much are we talking?

111
00:04:04,252 --> 00:04:05,510
Not a lot, like...

112
00:04:05,587 --> 00:04:08,397
100,000... I'd...
I'd really appreciate it.

113
00:04:08,474 --> 00:04:11,150
Fine, I'll do it.

114
00:04:11,226 --> 00:04:14,269
- Really?
- No, not really.

115
00:04:14,346 --> 00:04:18,023
You poisoned me,
so let me amend my response to

116
00:04:18,099 --> 00:04:19,219
hell no.

117
00:04:19,243 --> 00:04:21,201
Not a penny, son.

118
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:25,497
Being a parent's kind of fun.

119
00:04:28,794 --> 00:04:30,202
Enjoy.

120
00:04:30,278 --> 00:04:33,205
I call it<i> House of Deveraux.</i>

121
00:04:33,281 --> 00:04:37,737
A fabulous, sexy reality show
featuring myself, naturally,

122
00:04:37,761 --> 00:04:39,878
and my rising star daughter,

123
00:04:39,955 --> 00:04:42,409
Vanessa, all shot in my new home,

124
00:04:42,433 --> 00:04:43,715
Carrington Manor.

125
00:04:43,792 --> 00:04:45,133
It's very, um,

126
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:47,102
Kardashian/Jenner-like.

127
00:04:47,179 --> 00:04:48,312
But with singing.

128
00:04:49,356 --> 00:04:50,597
And me.

129
00:04:50,674 --> 00:04:52,557
Hmm, I'm thinking about it...

130
00:04:52,634 --> 00:04:53,778
but I'm not liking it.

131
00:04:53,802 --> 00:04:56,728
You produce a lot
of these shows, Stacey.

132
00:04:56,805 --> 00:04:59,114
This will be huge.

133
00:04:59,149 --> 00:05:00,565
You know who's gonna tune in to see you

134
00:05:00,642 --> 00:05:02,567
and your unknown daughter?

135
00:05:02,644 --> 00:05:03,697
No one.

136
00:05:04,521 --> 00:05:05,599
Now, maybe

137
00:05:05,623 --> 00:05:07,739
Blake Carrington could be a hot name

138
00:05:07,816 --> 00:05:09,574
coming off of his murder trial.

139
00:05:09,651 --> 00:05:11,868
And people seem to be very interested

140
00:05:11,945 --> 00:05:13,745
in his stunning new bride.

141
00:05:13,822 --> 00:05:17,082
Unfortunately,
Cristal and I aren't exactly besties.

142
00:05:17,158 --> 00:05:18,542
Well, neither are the housewives.

143
00:05:18,618 --> 00:05:21,086
But they are juicy and salacious.

144
00:05:21,162 --> 00:05:22,754
Show me a sizzle reel.

145
00:05:22,831 --> 00:05:25,682
A side to Cristal Carrington
no one knows about.

146
00:05:27,507 --> 00:05:28,885
I get it.

147
00:05:28,962 --> 00:05:30,762
So, when Fletcher gets here,
I'm gonna throw one of these

148
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:32,648
drinks in his face for not
telling me he was married.

149
00:05:32,724 --> 00:05:33,932
Why hasn't Adam texted me yet?

150
00:05:34,009 --> 00:05:35,629
This one will sting more.

151
00:05:35,653 --> 00:05:37,102
This one will stain more.

152
00:05:37,178 --> 00:05:38,987
And that one just tastes nasty.

153
00:05:39,064 --> 00:05:40,105
So, what do you think?

154
00:05:40,181 --> 00:05:41,240
We had amazing sex.

155
00:05:41,316 --> 00:05:43,108
- What's this guy's deal?
- I could salt the rim

156
00:05:43,184 --> 00:05:45,639
of this mojito for more bite.

157
00:05:45,663 --> 00:05:47,612
Kirby?

158
00:05:47,689 --> 00:05:48,813
Focus.

159
00:05:48,891 --> 00:05:51,311
Wait, I'm sorry,
you invited Fletcher here

160
00:05:51,335 --> 00:05:52,951
to throw a drink in his face?

161
00:05:53,028 --> 00:05:54,670
You're not really the
drink-throwing type.

162
00:05:55,724 --> 00:05:57,005
I know.

163
00:05:58,217 --> 00:05:59,958
Hi... Sam.

164
00:06:01,096 --> 00:06:03,804
- Fletcher.
- Just let me explain.

165
00:06:05,206 --> 00:06:07,160
Yes. I'm married.

166
00:06:07,184 --> 00:06:08,995
But we have an open marriage

167
00:06:09,019 --> 00:06:11,498
and my husband knows everything.

168
00:06:11,522 --> 00:06:13,305
There was no cheating.

169
00:06:13,381 --> 00:06:14,598
I just didn't

170
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:16,024
know how to tell you,
because some people

171
00:06:16,101 --> 00:06:17,192
have a problem with it.

172
00:06:18,845 --> 00:06:21,363
Well, I didn't see that coming.

173
00:06:22,354 --> 00:06:23,398
Kirby?

174
00:06:23,475 --> 00:06:24,649
Don't you have somewhere to be?

175
00:06:24,726 --> 00:06:26,846
Oh, no, not really.

176
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:28,370
Look, I can't stay anyway.

177
00:06:28,447 --> 00:06:30,122
I just wanted to tell
you the truth in person.

178
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,209
And to ask if you're

179
00:06:34,286 --> 00:06:35,752
still interested in seeing each other?

180
00:06:40,467 --> 00:06:42,134
That seems like a good idea.

181
00:06:43,745 --> 00:06:46,504
Great, I... I'll call you later.

182
00:06:47,585 --> 00:06:48,740
Okay.

183
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,841
- Bye.
- Bye.

184
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:51,176
Bye, Fletcher!

185
00:06:51,252 --> 00:06:52,597
That's a terrible idea.

186
00:06:53,592 --> 00:06:56,773
Oh, says the genius who
slept with Adam Carrington?

187
00:06:59,427 --> 00:07:00,880
<i>Okay, Liam will be here</i>

188
00:07:00,904 --> 00:07:02,354
any minute... when he gets here,

189
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:04,356
he will sit down,
tell me how great I look

190
00:07:04,432 --> 00:07:05,523
and order a drink. At that point,

191
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,275
I will propose, he will say yes,

192
00:07:07,352 --> 00:07:09,194
and on my cue, you will start playing.

193
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:10,654
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay? You got that?

194
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:11,988
Yes?

195
00:07:12,065 --> 00:07:13,531
Okay, okay, he's here.
Go hide.

196
00:07:13,608 --> 00:07:15,700
- Okay.
- Go hide faster!

197
00:07:15,777 --> 00:07:17,202
Hey, look at you

198
00:07:17,278 --> 00:07:19,496
all clean and sweat-free.

199
00:07:19,572 --> 00:07:21,359
Really? 'Cause I'm kind of freakin' out.

200
00:07:21,383 --> 00:07:22,666
Oh, no, don't. You smell great.

201
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:24,092
What? No. No, no, no.

202
00:07:24,169 --> 00:07:25,710
But I just got huge news.

203
00:07:25,787 --> 00:07:27,545
- Mm-hmm.
- I have an opportunity to pitch a book idea

204
00:07:27,622 --> 00:07:29,451
to one of the most important
publishers in the world.

205
00:07:29,475 --> 00:07:30,974
Wow! Wow, that is great news.

206
00:07:31,051 --> 00:07:33,747
And I can't wait to talk
about it in 15 minutes.

207
00:07:33,771 --> 00:07:36,054
- Could we just get you a drink?
- Yeah, that's the problem.

208
00:07:36,131 --> 00:07:38,056
The publisher's in London,
so I have to fly out tomorrow.

209
00:07:38,133 --> 00:07:39,753
So, what's the problem?

210
00:07:39,777 --> 00:07:41,109
I need a rain check on tonight,

211
00:07:41,186 --> 00:07:42,444
'cause I have so much to do.

212
00:07:42,521 --> 00:07:44,780
I need to pack,
flesh out my idea, write notes.

213
00:07:44,856 --> 00:07:46,448
And this has to happen tomorrow?

214
00:07:46,525 --> 00:07:48,116
I know it's sudden,
but they're insisting.

215
00:07:48,193 --> 00:07:49,451
It's an opportunity
that I can't pass up.

216
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:52,432
Okay, it's fine. Whatever. Go.

217
00:07:52,456 --> 00:07:54,239
Oh, also, I'd...

218
00:07:54,315 --> 00:07:55,440
love to borrow the jet.

219
00:07:55,517 --> 00:07:57,103
So, do you think
you could set that up for me

220
00:07:57,127 --> 00:07:59,077
while I get ready?
You should come with me.

221
00:07:59,154 --> 00:08:00,774
No, no. That's fine.

222
00:08:00,798 --> 00:08:03,298
I will just... wait until you get back.

223
00:08:04,425 --> 00:08:05,967
- Wait?
- Oh, to...

224
00:08:06,044 --> 00:08:08,086
- congratulate you, silly.
- Okay, well,

225
00:08:08,163 --> 00:08:09,179
- I got to run, so...
- Mm-hmm.

226
00:08:09,205 --> 00:08:11,348
- Think on it?
- Okay, I will.

227
00:08:16,993 --> 00:08:18,563
Not the gesture.

228
00:08:27,537 --> 00:08:30,242
I mean, the obvious move is
to wait for Liam to get back

229
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:31,323
and then propose to him then.

230
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:33,412
Because it has to be perfect. Right?

231
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:37,541
Totally. So, for my date with Fletcher,

232
00:08:37,618 --> 00:08:39,209
I'm thinking of wearing
this kind of an...

233
00:08:39,286 --> 00:08:41,771
"Open marriage? Who cares?" vibe.

234
00:08:41,806 --> 00:08:43,639
But there's also this...

235
00:08:43,716 --> 00:08:47,426
"I'm obviously hotter
than your husband" deal.

236
00:08:47,503 --> 00:08:49,386
I'm legit torn. Can you help me?

237
00:08:49,463 --> 00:08:51,764
Maybe I'm putting too
much pressure on myself.

238
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,098
It doesn't have to be a perfect

239
00:08:53,175 --> 00:08:54,253
storybook proposal, you know?

240
00:08:54,277 --> 00:08:55,934
Every time I go for a fairy tale,

241
00:08:56,011 --> 00:08:57,131
it ends up being a disaster.

242
00:08:57,155 --> 00:08:58,512
I mean, we're like Hansel and Gretel,

243
00:08:58,589 --> 00:09:00,898
except if the witch actually
ate them in the end,

244
00:09:00,974 --> 00:09:02,283
and then got food poisoning.

245
00:09:02,359 --> 00:09:05,110
Okay, I think you should
totally go to London with him.

246
00:09:05,187 --> 00:09:07,692
I mean, he clearly wants you to,

247
00:09:07,727 --> 00:09:09,765
and it's not like you have
anything else to do here.

248
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,803
Interesting.

249
00:09:10,859 --> 00:09:14,302
I guess I could go with him
and find the perfect moment to propose.

250
00:09:14,714 --> 00:09:17,840
I could take him to my
favorite chocolate shop

251
00:09:17,917 --> 00:09:20,084
in the world and propose to him there.

252
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,322
Chocolate shop?
Who are you, Willy Wonka?

253
00:09:22,346 --> 00:09:23,629
I could even propose on the plane.

254
00:09:23,705 --> 00:09:24,722
That's interesting.

255
00:09:25,758 --> 00:09:26,994
Okay, so, um...

256
00:09:27,913 --> 00:09:28,928
which outfit?

257
00:09:29,429 --> 00:09:30,530
For what? Where are you going?

258
00:09:30,554 --> 00:09:32,855
You are seriously <i>the</i> worst friend.

259
00:09:32,932 --> 00:09:34,181
Oh, please.

260
00:09:34,258 --> 00:09:36,100
Last night you wanted to marry me.

261
00:09:36,176 --> 00:09:38,936
Top from A, bottom from B,
and we're gonna need an option C

262
00:09:39,012 --> 00:09:40,988
- for the shoes.
- Really?

263
00:09:43,198 --> 00:09:44,011
Anders.

264
00:09:44,035 --> 00:09:45,868
I've been looking everywhere for you.

265
00:09:45,945 --> 00:09:47,890
You found me. Well done.

266
00:09:47,914 --> 00:09:49,113
Now, if you don't mind...

267
00:09:49,189 --> 00:09:51,207
I do mind.
I need some advice on Cristal.

268
00:09:51,283 --> 00:09:54,749
How can I befriend her,
get her to really open up to me?

269
00:09:54,784 --> 00:09:55,994
I'm not sure that's possible.

270
00:09:56,071 --> 00:09:58,748
Also, I would consider helping you...

271
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:00,431
but I don't trust you.

272
00:10:00,466 --> 00:10:01,884
No need to trust.

273
00:10:01,961 --> 00:10:04,169
I just want to be friends
with my sister-in-law.

274
00:10:04,246 --> 00:10:05,532
So let's say I wanted to arrange

275
00:10:05,556 --> 00:10:07,297
a special dinner for her.

276
00:10:07,374 --> 00:10:08,549
What would that look like?

277
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:10,204
Does she have a strong
feeling about kale?

278
00:10:10,228 --> 00:10:13,155
Mrs. Carrington's feelings about kale

279
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:14,208
are hers and hers alone.

280
00:10:14,232 --> 00:10:16,398
Classic Anders.

281
00:10:16,475 --> 00:10:18,475
You're like a field general...

282
00:10:18,552 --> 00:10:20,214
unflappable in battle

283
00:10:20,238 --> 00:10:23,856
and always the smartest man in the room.

284
00:10:23,932 --> 00:10:26,693
That's why I've had a secret
crush on you for years.

285
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,555
I was unaware.

286
00:10:28,579 --> 00:10:30,654
Well, now you know... General.

287
00:10:30,731 --> 00:10:32,674
At ease, Soldier.

288
00:10:32,709 --> 00:10:34,741
If you do want to have this dinner,

289
00:10:34,818 --> 00:10:37,419
Mrs. Carrington has an
affinity for roasted pork.

290
00:10:37,496 --> 00:10:40,038
May I please go about my business now?

291
00:10:40,115 --> 00:10:41,132
Of course.

292
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:45,210
Whoa!

293
00:10:45,287 --> 00:10:46,503
We're going for one night.

294
00:10:47,594 --> 00:10:49,883
Hey, you never know what could happen.

295
00:10:49,918 --> 00:10:52,681
We could have a reason to
celebrate and stay longer.

296
00:10:52,716 --> 00:10:53,718
Celebrate?

297
00:10:53,831 --> 00:10:55,582
Oh. You know,
if they buy your book idea.

298
00:10:55,606 --> 00:10:57,022
Are you okay?

299
00:10:57,099 --> 00:11:00,184
I've just never seen you be
so giddy about my career.

300
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:01,894
Even when you were my publisher.

301
00:11:03,096 --> 00:11:05,731
But it feels nice to be supported.

302
00:11:05,807 --> 00:11:08,192
No. Well, I am always supportive.

303
00:11:08,268 --> 00:11:10,536
Sometimes it's just a
little less obvious.

304
00:11:11,622 --> 00:11:13,071
But I think this trip is gonna be

305
00:11:13,148 --> 00:11:14,748
a memorable one for both of us.

306
00:11:17,819 --> 00:11:19,217
Let's go to London.

307
00:11:30,274 --> 00:11:31,548
<i>I got three local affiliates</i>

308
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:33,893
to cover the event, plus HGTV.

309
00:11:35,313 --> 00:11:37,124
And then I hit a nun with a taxi.

310
00:11:38,321 --> 00:11:39,364
What?

311
00:11:40,414 --> 00:11:41,499
Is everything okay?

312
00:11:42,048 --> 00:11:43,092
No.

313
00:11:43,477 --> 00:11:45,029
I can't stop thinking of your husband.

314
00:11:45,105 --> 00:11:48,941
Hey, look, I assure you my
husband is not thinking of you.

315
00:11:49,017 --> 00:11:51,235
No offense.
And the open marriage was his idea.

316
00:11:51,311 --> 00:11:54,404
But I'm-I'm... fine with it.

317
00:11:55,672 --> 00:11:56,681
Are you positive?

318
00:11:57,583 --> 00:11:59,479
I am. Yeah, it works.

319
00:11:59,503 --> 00:12:01,620
Can you tell me what time it is?

320
00:12:01,697 --> 00:12:03,288
Aren't you wearing a watch?

321
00:12:04,487 --> 00:12:05,566
I'd rather hear you say it.

322
00:12:12,332 --> 00:12:13,966
What is this?

323
00:12:15,129 --> 00:12:16,167
Oh.

324
00:12:17,214 --> 00:12:18,228
Wow.

325
00:12:19,857 --> 00:12:21,440
This is beautiful.

326
00:12:23,787 --> 00:12:24,885
Thank you.

327
00:12:26,864 --> 00:12:28,948
For everything.

328
00:12:32,227 --> 00:12:34,152
Dominique?

329
00:12:35,187 --> 00:12:36,697
Welcome home, Cristal.

330
00:12:36,732 --> 00:12:37,990
Okay, that's a little creepy.

331
00:12:38,066 --> 00:12:40,325
I just wanted to document tonight.

332
00:12:40,402 --> 00:12:43,787
I thought you might be
hungry from your long trip,

333
00:12:43,864 --> 00:12:46,331
so I catered in a small feast for us.

334
00:12:46,408 --> 00:12:49,001
It's from the best
barbecue joint in Atlanta.

335
00:12:49,077 --> 00:12:52,337
We have pork ribs and pulled
pork and smoked sausages

336
00:12:52,414 --> 00:12:55,173
and even... pigs in a blanket for fun.

337
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:56,703
What the hell is going on here?

338
00:12:56,727 --> 00:12:58,302
I want us to spend time together.

339
00:12:58,378 --> 00:13:02,139
And after dessert, I brought in
the dream team of beauticians.

340
00:13:02,215 --> 00:13:04,711
We can get manis and pedis and waxing

341
00:13:04,735 --> 00:13:06,351
together, just like sisters.

342
00:13:06,428 --> 00:13:08,279
This is all insane.

343
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,808
- Plus, I'm allergic to pork.
- What?

344
00:13:11,843 --> 00:13:13,525
I need to get out of here.
I have to go lie down.

345
00:13:13,602 --> 00:13:15,360
How about on those massage tables?

346
00:13:15,437 --> 00:13:17,579
We could get a couples massage and chat?

347
00:13:20,251 --> 00:13:22,868
So this is nice, right?

348
00:13:22,944 --> 00:13:25,871
I... would like to make a toast

349
00:13:25,947 --> 00:13:28,735
to you... Liam.

350
00:13:28,759 --> 00:13:30,737
Actually, hold that thought,
save the toast.

351
00:13:30,761 --> 00:13:33,086
- I got a better idea.
- I'm pretty sure you don't.

352
00:13:33,163 --> 00:13:34,430
No, this is perfect.

353
00:13:34,506 --> 00:13:35,575
I need to practice my pitch.

354
00:13:35,599 --> 00:13:37,141
All right, this project could be

355
00:13:37,217 --> 00:13:39,579
life-changing for me, and I...
I need to nail it in the room.

356
00:13:39,603 --> 00:13:42,054
- Mm-hmm.
- And since we're gonna be here for a while, I mean,

357
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:43,180
why not do it now, right?

358
00:13:43,256 --> 00:13:44,690
It's so perfect.

359
00:13:44,767 --> 00:13:46,725
Okay, so any feedback
is appreciated... characters,

360
00:13:46,802 --> 00:13:48,393
plot, anything.

361
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:51,063
- I'm starting to wish I was in coach.
- Okay. Yeah. Sorry.

362
00:13:51,139 --> 00:13:52,193
I'll start.

363
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:56,735
It started on a day like any other.

364
00:13:58,447 --> 00:14:01,101
<i>I was tying up loose ends
on a nasty espionage case</i>

365
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:03,033
<i>when a rich nightclub
owner showed himself in</i>

366
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:04,518
<i>like he owned the place.</i>

367
00:14:05,885 --> 00:14:08,266
They say you're a pretty good
private detective, Leland.

368
00:14:08,301 --> 00:14:09,748
Some say I'm the best, pal.

369
00:14:09,825 --> 00:14:11,116
Some say you<i> were</i> the best.

370
00:14:11,193 --> 00:14:14,086
Well, some say...
Okay, we could do this all day.

371
00:14:14,162 --> 00:14:17,255
- Get to the point.
- There was a jewelry heist at my nightclub.

372
00:14:17,332 --> 00:14:19,077
Since I'd rather not
have the cops involved,

373
00:14:19,101 --> 00:14:20,759
I want you on the case.

374
00:14:20,836 --> 00:14:23,228
I know you<i> and</i> your nightclub,
Mr. Sanders.

375
00:14:24,181 --> 00:14:25,722
I'm not interested in the case.

376
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:28,934
A P.I. turning down a case?
Not something you see every day.

377
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:30,319
Yeah, well, I got my reasons.

378
00:14:30,396 --> 00:14:32,938
There's not a damn thing you
can do to change my mind.

379
00:14:33,894 --> 00:14:35,302
We'll see about that.

380
00:14:35,326 --> 00:14:36,483
Blaine, get in here!

381
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,609
Tout de suite!

382
00:14:37,686 --> 00:14:38,764
Sorry, sir.

383
00:14:38,788 --> 00:14:40,307
I didn't hear you at first.

384
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:42,601
- Get a hearing aid.
- Yeah.

385
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,791
Please change the gentleman's mind.

386
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:48,587
Oh, yeah. Uh...

387
00:14:52,343 --> 00:14:54,134
Where's your mind at now, Leland?

388
00:14:56,755 --> 00:14:59,264
Nice plate of greens is
good for a man's diet.

389
00:15:00,384 --> 00:15:01,800
I'm on the case.

390
00:15:06,425 --> 00:15:09,578
That Peach Diamond is priceless.
It's my baby.

391
00:15:09,654 --> 00:15:13,311
I want you to nab the thief
and return Kirby to me.

392
00:15:13,867 --> 00:15:15,278
It's what I call the diamond.

393
00:15:15,302 --> 00:15:17,127
Oh.

394
00:15:18,346 --> 00:15:19,491
<i>So you put the diamond</i>

395
00:15:19,515 --> 00:15:21,465
<i>in the safe in your office.</i>

396
00:15:21,541 --> 00:15:23,434
<i>And then the power goes out.</i>

397
00:15:31,527 --> 00:15:32,976
<i>I'll bet my last buffalo nickel</i>

398
00:15:33,053 --> 00:15:35,872
it was the new busboy,
Aidan, that stole it.

399
00:15:35,907 --> 00:15:38,014
He's more suspicious
than a three-legged cat,

400
00:15:38,092 --> 00:15:40,011
and he skipped town
right after the robbery.

401
00:15:40,035 --> 00:15:41,847
Well, it's always an inside job.

402
00:15:41,871 --> 00:15:43,245
Except when it isn't.

403
00:15:43,322 --> 00:15:44,988
How much is your fee again?

404
00:15:45,065 --> 00:15:46,156
I'll ask the questions, Sanders.

405
00:15:47,248 --> 00:15:48,325
Such as, why'd you keep such a hot rock

406
00:15:48,401 --> 00:15:50,160
in your club instead of your home safe?

407
00:15:50,237 --> 00:15:52,162
I don't trust anybody there, either.

408
00:15:52,239 --> 00:15:54,498
Right.

409
00:15:54,574 --> 00:15:57,626
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to the fabulous Club Sanders.

410
00:15:57,702 --> 00:15:59,614
Magic is in the air every night here,

411
00:15:59,638 --> 00:16:02,839
but tonight, my friends,
the magic is real.

412
00:16:02,916 --> 00:16:05,509
So I'm gonna need you
beautiful people to show

413
00:16:05,585 --> 00:16:07,511
some deep love to the extravagant,

414
00:16:07,587 --> 00:16:10,180
the exquisite, the vivacious

415
00:16:10,257 --> 00:16:14,045

438
00:17:44,309 --> 00:17:46,819
<i>and my heart started
ripping through my shirt.</i>

439
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:57,271
So, how do you like it so far?

440
00:17:57,306 --> 00:18:00,790
Well, I have to be honest.
It was a little meh at first.

441
00:18:00,867 --> 00:18:02,153
But then, the lounge singer came in,

442
00:18:02,177 --> 00:18:03,321
and it got much more exciting.

443
00:18:03,345 --> 00:18:04,753
Okay, just wait.

444
00:18:04,829 --> 00:18:06,825
Mm-hmm. Hmm.

445
00:18:12,482 --> 00:18:14,930
<i>I knew I had to
interview everyone in the joint,</i>

446
00:18:15,006 --> 00:18:17,474
<i>so I stopped staring
and started talking.</i>

447
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,171
Sure I was drinking here that night,

448
00:18:20,195 --> 00:18:22,312
but I have no alibi,

449
00:18:22,389 --> 00:18:25,148
because I come and go a lot.

450
00:18:25,225 --> 00:18:28,318
No one ever recognizes my face.

451
00:18:28,395 --> 00:18:31,371
Been slinging cocktails here forever.

452
00:18:31,448 --> 00:18:34,157
I'd never steal from my boss, Sanders.

453
00:18:34,234 --> 00:18:36,354
He's always been so good to me,

454
00:18:36,378 --> 00:18:39,788
especially when I've been so bad.

455
00:18:39,864 --> 00:18:42,480
I see everything from up here on stage.

456
00:18:42,515 --> 00:18:44,668
So you want to know who I saw
slinking around that night

457
00:18:44,744 --> 00:18:46,169
the lights went out in Georgia?

458
00:18:46,246 --> 00:18:47,866
No one, 'cause it was pitch black.

459
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:49,798
You're never gonna find that diamond.

460
00:18:49,874 --> 00:18:52,467
Where was I at the time?

461
00:18:52,544 --> 00:18:54,978
Easy. I was, uh, moving the boss's car.

462
00:18:56,089 --> 00:18:57,514
Filling it with gas.

463
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:59,858
Hmm.

464
00:19:00,927 --> 00:19:02,881
Happy to see you, Leland.

465
00:19:02,905 --> 00:19:04,854
I know you'll dig for the truth

466
00:19:04,931 --> 00:19:06,551
and prove the busboy didn't do it.

467
00:19:06,575 --> 00:19:08,053
Because Aidan's my brother,

468
00:19:08,077 --> 00:19:12,195
and he's being framed
like a Monet... or a Manet.

469
00:19:12,272 --> 00:19:13,822
I didn't know you had a brother,

470
00:19:13,898 --> 00:19:17,668
Veronica,
or such a sweeping knowledge of art.

471
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:20,537
I'd like to chat with Aidan.

472
00:19:21,312 --> 00:19:22,664
Well, of course you would,
but you can't.

473
00:19:22,741 --> 00:19:25,208
You see, he's hiding out until
the real thief is caught.

474
00:19:25,285 --> 00:19:27,043
It's too hot for him here.

475
00:19:28,063 --> 00:19:29,087
You're looking good.

476
00:19:30,457 --> 00:19:32,023
For whatever it's worth.

477
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:34,579
The last time you told me I was
looking good was two seconds

478
00:19:34,603 --> 00:19:36,353
before you slammed the door on my grill.

479
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:39,481
But I'm still gonna crack this case.

480
00:19:41,092 --> 00:19:43,713
But for now, maybe we keep our distance.

481
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:46,679
<i>Why is he being so rude to her?</i>

482
00:19:46,714 --> 00:19:49,357
I mean, it's clear
that the singer is the hero,

483
00:19:49,434 --> 00:19:51,234
and the P.I. should be
treating her like one.

484
00:19:51,311 --> 00:19:52,569
Okay, so you're invested in the story.

485
00:19:52,645 --> 00:19:54,571
Mm-mm. Uh...

486
00:19:54,647 --> 00:19:56,197
Just keep going.

487
00:19:57,617 --> 00:19:59,576
So, tell me, Lexi.

488
00:19:59,652 --> 00:20:01,911
No one remembers seeing
you at your husband's club

489
00:20:01,988 --> 00:20:03,705
the night the Peach Diamond was poached.

490
00:20:03,782 --> 00:20:05,915
Believe me, darling.

491
00:20:05,992 --> 00:20:08,251
If I had been there,
they'd all remember seeing me.

492
00:20:08,328 --> 00:20:10,420
This is a face you don't forget.

493
00:20:11,503 --> 00:20:12,588
Right.

494
00:20:12,959 --> 00:20:14,473
So, where were you that night?

495
00:20:14,508 --> 00:20:16,142
I was in bed, of course.

496
00:20:16,177 --> 00:20:19,220
I can take you upstairs if
you'd like to... touch it.

497
00:20:20,332 --> 00:20:21,890
I'm a little chilly right now.

498
00:20:21,966 --> 00:20:24,893
Well, if you want to get toasty...

499
00:20:24,969 --> 00:20:28,438
...why don't you take a
step closer to the fire?

500
00:20:28,515 --> 00:20:31,107
I don't do well with fire, mister.

501
00:20:31,184 --> 00:20:34,444
But I'm really good at
conducting body heat.

502
00:20:34,521 --> 00:20:37,113
<i>I didn't have time for hanky-panky.</i>

503
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:38,810
I don't have time for hanky-panky.

504
00:20:40,111 --> 00:20:41,785
Sal! Little Joe!

505
00:20:41,861 --> 00:20:43,953
Get this bum out of here.

506
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:46,623
No need, ma'am.
This bum will show himself out.

507
00:20:46,699 --> 00:20:48,792
But the next time you get cold?

508
00:20:50,067 --> 00:20:51,136
Try a light sweater.

509
00:20:55,592 --> 00:20:57,996
Hey. Why don't we take a stroll, pal.

510
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:59,302
Maybe have a little chat.

511
00:20:59,379 --> 00:21:01,499
- Easy. I bruise like a baby peach.
- Aw.

512
00:21:01,523 --> 00:21:03,807
Then I'm thinking you don't show
your face around here no more.

513
00:21:03,883 --> 00:21:05,809
Yeah, and I'm wondering
what else you two gentlemen

514
00:21:05,885 --> 00:21:09,145
do around here besides
rough up innocent P.I.s.

515
00:21:09,222 --> 00:21:11,491
Actually, I handle accommodations.

516
00:21:11,526 --> 00:21:13,366
So if you ever need a place to stay,

517
00:21:13,443 --> 00:21:15,110
I can give you my card.

518
00:21:15,186 --> 00:21:17,821
And I, uh,
deal with Mr. Sanders' vehicles.

519
00:21:17,897 --> 00:21:19,684
See, cars are kind of my thing.

520
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:22,284
Well, something's puzzling me because...

521
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:23,326
No, don't!

522
00:21:23,403 --> 00:21:24,522
Relax.

523
00:21:24,546 --> 00:21:26,379
Just gonna water these petunias.

524
00:21:26,456 --> 00:21:29,390
Okay. That's not what I thought

525
00:21:29,391 --> 00:21:30,591
- you were gonna say about that.
- Hey, pal.

526
00:21:32,796 --> 00:21:34,221
I trust my beak,

527
00:21:34,297 --> 00:21:36,131
and something about you
doesn't smell right.

528
00:21:36,207 --> 00:21:39,008
- I didn't lay a hand on the boss's jewels.
- Maybe not,

529
00:21:39,085 --> 00:21:40,705
but you laid them all
over the boss's wife,

530
00:21:40,729 --> 00:21:42,436
- didn't you?
- What?

531
00:21:42,514 --> 00:21:44,564
That meathead Little Joe says he
runs the show on Sanders' cars.

532
00:21:44,641 --> 00:21:45,960
So one plus two means you lied

533
00:21:45,984 --> 00:21:47,609
to me about where you
were the other night.

534
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:49,978
You weren't at a gas station.

535
00:21:50,054 --> 00:21:51,980
Yeah. And how'd you know

536
00:21:52,056 --> 00:21:53,406
I was banging the boss's wife?

537
00:21:53,483 --> 00:21:55,817
I didn't until you just said it.

538
00:21:56,652 --> 00:21:57,869
Guess I got a little lucky there, huh?

539
00:21:57,946 --> 00:21:59,621
Eh, not as lucky as me.

540
00:21:59,698 --> 00:22:02,440
You've seen Lexi. She's a knockout.

541
00:22:02,475 --> 00:22:05,493
I can't imagine being married to her,
but hell of a sidepiece, right?

542
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:06,828
<i>Wait.</i>

543
00:22:06,905 --> 00:22:08,900
- What?
- I'm just trying to add some flavor.

544
00:22:08,924 --> 00:22:12,500
I am starting to get confused,
which is not the ideal flavor

545
00:22:12,577 --> 00:22:14,261
you want to leave your audience with.
Can you just

546
00:22:14,337 --> 00:22:15,846
tell me who stole the Peach Diamond

547
00:22:15,922 --> 00:22:18,243
so that this can be over
and I can tell you my story?

548
00:22:18,267 --> 00:22:20,341
My story with the happiest ending ever

549
00:22:20,418 --> 00:22:21,509
where everything makes sense?

550
00:22:21,586 --> 00:22:23,511
Sounds amazing. But not yet.

551
00:22:23,588 --> 00:22:26,251
Because things are about
to get crazy in mine.

552
00:22:40,223 --> 00:22:41,490
<i>The last time something</i>

553
00:22:41,566 --> 00:22:43,108
<i>this hot was in my office was when</i>

554
00:22:43,184 --> 00:22:44,776
<i>my portable wok exploded.</i>

555
00:22:44,853 --> 00:22:47,987
Funny me, thinking the lock
on my door keeps people out.

556
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:50,203
Well, my key's still good,

557
00:22:50,238 --> 00:22:52,117
so I let myself in.

558
00:22:52,193 --> 00:22:53,502
If I come up with any more questions

559
00:22:53,578 --> 00:22:56,062
about the case, I'll knock on your door.

560
00:22:56,543 --> 00:22:58,123
But now, feel free to use that one.

561
00:22:58,199 --> 00:22:59,341
Oh,

562
00:22:59,418 --> 00:23:01,626
I'm not here to talk
about the case, Leland.

563
00:23:02,577 --> 00:23:05,255
But it doesn't take a detective to know

564
00:23:05,331 --> 00:23:07,966
that you got tossed
around like a rag doll.

565
00:23:08,042 --> 00:23:11,520
Sometimes I wish I had amnesia
so I could forget you existed.

566
00:23:12,318 --> 00:23:13,763
Tell me, Detective.

567
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:17,569
Do you remember... this?

568
00:23:21,473 --> 00:23:22,939
That top lip rings a bell.

569
00:23:23,016 --> 00:23:24,991
Try the bottom. They're twins.

570
00:23:29,936 --> 00:23:31,617
Leland. It's me, Blaine.

571
00:23:31,652 --> 00:23:33,491
I just remembered something,
something big.

572
00:23:33,568 --> 00:23:35,855
I need to talk to you tonight.

573
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:37,546
You know what?

574
00:23:37,622 --> 00:23:40,957
I just realized that I've
forgotten a few details

575
00:23:41,034 --> 00:23:42,529
about you.

576
00:23:42,553 --> 00:23:44,511
How'd you like to jog my memories?

577
00:23:53,875 --> 00:23:54,904
<i>Whoa, hey, there.</i>

578
00:23:55,998 --> 00:23:58,733
I think the story is in great shape.

579
00:24:00,362 --> 00:24:03,688
I'm totally feeling the characters.

580
00:24:03,765 --> 00:24:06,533
But what I want to be
feeling is the author.

581
00:24:09,646 --> 00:24:11,227
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

582
00:24:11,289 --> 00:24:13,226
- What?
- No, no, we can't have sex yet.

583
00:24:14,372 --> 00:24:16,418
We're almost in London,
and I need to finish telling the story.

584
00:24:18,497 --> 00:24:20,705
Fine. Just keep it sexy,

585
00:24:20,782 --> 00:24:22,735
pick up the pace and skip to the end.

Well, I haven't seen the papers today,

603
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:25,320

- Nobody leaves.
- Uh, should I keep singing?

612
00:25:46,534 --> 00:25:48,960
Nobody sings.

613
00:25:49,037 --> 00:25:51,846
There was a serious crime here,
and I know who did it.

614
00:25:51,923 --> 00:25:53,415
The diamond heist?

615
00:25:53,708 --> 00:25:55,351
Or the murder?

616
00:25:55,519 --> 00:25:57,151
The murder seems bigger.

617
00:25:57,228 --> 00:25:59,762
Oh, please. People get murdered
left and right around here.

618
00:25:59,839 --> 00:26:03,002
I was hired to catch a thief,
and that's what I'm gonna do.

619
00:26:03,026 --> 00:26:05,268
It was the busboy, Aidan.

620
00:26:06,022 --> 00:26:07,145
That's a lie!

621
00:26:07,221 --> 00:26:09,175
He's gone, and he's never coming back.

622
00:26:09,199 --> 00:26:12,701
Or did he come back
to tie up loose ends?

623
00:26:12,777 --> 00:26:14,472
What, you don't see him?

624
00:26:14,496 --> 00:26:16,329
Maybe he's the invisible man.

625
00:26:18,208 --> 00:26:19,365
Or woman.

626
00:26:23,204 --> 00:26:25,622
- No!
- The baby!

627
00:26:27,767 --> 00:26:28,767
It was a doll?

628
00:26:30,045 --> 00:26:32,554
Poison! I'd bet five bucks on it.

629
00:26:32,631 --> 00:26:34,556
Five whole bucks?

630
00:26:34,633 --> 00:26:37,058
Get your mitts off me.
I did nothing, you hear?

631
00:26:37,135 --> 00:26:38,785
We're gonna take you in. But first,

632
00:26:38,862 --> 00:26:41,346
- we're gonna take you out.
- Got to make sure justice gets served.

633
00:26:41,797 --> 00:26:43,898
Oh! I'll never let them

634
00:26:43,975 --> 00:26:46,017
strap you to that mean,
old electric chair.

635
00:26:47,001 --> 00:26:48,686
Not my brother.

636
00:26:51,724 --> 00:26:53,316
<i>She was gone.</i>

637
00:26:53,393 --> 00:26:55,860
<i>For good.</i>

638
00:26:55,937 --> 00:26:58,655
Wait. Wait, no.

639
00:27:00,876 --> 00:27:03,209
Smart move taking a plane, Veronica.

640
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,754
Sure, a bus is cheaper.

641
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:07,589
A train's more clickety-clack romantic,

642
00:27:07,666 --> 00:27:10,717
but they don't make you
disappear like that.

643
00:27:12,003 --> 00:27:13,762
What are you doing here, Leland?

644
00:27:13,838 --> 00:27:15,408
You picking your mom up?

645
00:27:15,432 --> 00:27:16,598
Well, hopefully,

646
00:27:16,675 --> 00:27:18,161
you'll get lucky,
and her plane'll crash.

647
00:27:18,185 --> 00:27:20,176
First you manipulated your brother

648
00:27:20,253 --> 00:27:22,915
to steal the Peach Diamond for you.

649
00:27:22,939 --> 00:27:24,773
Then you manipulated Sanders to hire me,

650
00:27:24,849 --> 00:27:27,016
intending the trail to
lead right to Aidan.

651
00:27:28,386 --> 00:27:31,279
You're even crazier than
shorts with high heels.

652
00:27:31,356 --> 00:27:33,398
You had to have Blaine killed
when he learned the truth,

653
00:27:33,474 --> 00:27:35,075
which is why you told
Aidan to come back.

654
00:27:36,144 --> 00:27:39,362
But why would your
brother ax Blaine for you?

655
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,364
Simple.

656
00:27:41,441 --> 00:27:42,916
He's not your brother.

657
00:27:44,152 --> 00:27:45,535
He's your lover!

658
00:27:47,164 --> 00:27:48,946
That bastard. Did he tell you that?

659
00:27:49,024 --> 00:27:51,249
He didn't have to.
I saw the look on his face

660
00:27:51,325 --> 00:27:52,750
when you gave him the ole
"see you later."

661
00:27:52,827 --> 00:27:55,503
I'd recognize that look anywhere.

662
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:56,638
It's the look I saw on my face

663
00:27:56,715 --> 00:27:58,256
when you gave me the ole
"see you later."

664
00:27:58,332 --> 00:28:00,425
Well, that makes no sense.
You can't see your own face.

665
00:28:00,501 --> 00:28:01,976
I'm assuming that's how I looked, okay?

666
00:28:03,031 --> 00:28:04,957
The point is, like Aidan,

667
00:28:04,981 --> 00:28:07,627
I would've killed for you
at one point, too.

668
00:28:09,135 --> 00:28:12,395
You think you know everything,
but you know nothing.

669
00:28:12,472 --> 00:28:13,730
The only thing I don't know

670
00:28:13,806 --> 00:28:15,281
is what you did with the Peach Diamond.

671
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:20,203
Wouldn't happen to be
in that handbag, would it?

672
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:30,130
I caught you red-handed.

673
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,487
Peach-handed.

674
00:28:34,511 --> 00:28:36,804
You got to listen to me, Leland.

675
00:28:36,839 --> 00:28:37,920
I can change.

676
00:28:37,997 --> 00:28:39,848
And that rock's worth millions.

677
00:28:39,924 --> 00:28:41,725
Let's run away together.

678
00:28:43,186 --> 00:28:45,928
Me and you, baby, till the end of time.

679
00:28:46,628 --> 00:28:48,264
<i>I was torn.</i>

680
00:28:48,341 --> 00:28:51,170
<i>I wanted to believe her,
but she'd lied to me</i>

681
00:28:51,194 --> 00:28:52,402
<i>over and over again.</i>

682
00:28:52,479 --> 00:28:53,862
<i>So many times.</i>

683
00:28:53,938 --> 00:28:55,071
<i>Repeatedly.</i>

684
00:29:10,121 --> 00:29:12,121
You're a bigger fool than Aidan.

685
00:29:12,198 --> 00:29:14,165
And he's a big fool.

686
00:29:14,242 --> 00:29:15,341
Huge.

687
00:29:16,961 --> 00:29:18,595
Goodbye, Leland.

688
00:29:20,206 --> 00:29:21,868
I'll see you in hell.

689
00:29:29,048 --> 00:29:30,690
I removed the bullets, Veronica.

690
00:29:32,385 --> 00:29:33,684
So who's the huge fool now?

691
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:36,854
Rhetorical question implying
you're the huge fool.

692
00:29:36,931 --> 00:29:38,523
No. No!

693
00:29:38,806 --> 00:29:40,483
<i>It wasn't the ending I chose</i>

694
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,054
<i>but the one that chose me.</i>

695
00:29:42,078 --> 00:29:43,319
<i>Unlucky.</i>

696
00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:46,017
Well, look at that.

697
00:29:46,041 --> 00:29:48,032
Your pitch lasted the entire flight.

698
00:29:48,109 --> 00:29:49,562
So? What'd you think?

699
00:29:49,586 --> 00:29:52,086
Uh, yeah, I thought it was...
it was good.

700
00:29:52,163 --> 00:29:53,797
Good? That's it?

701
00:29:55,116 --> 00:29:56,332
Fallon, my pitch is in an hour.

702
00:29:56,409 --> 00:29:58,404
Okay, well, tiny thought.

703
00:29:58,428 --> 00:30:01,045
Maybe postpone it a few weeks

704
00:30:01,122 --> 00:30:02,839
or, I don't know, a year.

705
00:30:02,915 --> 00:30:03,965
Why?

706
00:30:04,041 --> 00:30:05,578
Well, honestly,

707
00:30:05,602 --> 00:30:07,677
it didn't make sense in a lot of places.

708
00:30:07,753 --> 00:30:08,886
Okay, like where?

709
00:30:08,963 --> 00:30:10,271
Like everywhere.

710
00:30:10,348 --> 00:30:12,390
I mean, how did the P.I.
suddenly figure everything out?

711
00:30:12,466 --> 00:30:14,378
Why was Aidan in a dress?

712
00:30:14,402 --> 00:30:16,214
And were Sal and Little Joe cops,

713
00:30:16,238 --> 00:30:17,815
or were they security guards?

714
00:30:17,839 --> 00:30:19,656
- I don't know. It was all very confusing.
- Well, I don't agree.

715
00:30:19,732 --> 00:30:20,949
Oh, and another thing?

716
00:30:21,025 --> 00:30:22,951
You made Veronica <i>way</i> too manipulative.

717
00:30:23,027 --> 00:30:25,236
You know what? The story's solid.

718
00:30:25,313 --> 00:30:28,792
- I just think you didn't understand it.
- Excuse me?

719
00:30:28,816 --> 00:30:31,535
It's a complex story. Maybe
you just weren't able to follow it.

720
00:30:32,067 --> 00:30:35,015
Well, I'm following that you're
calling me dumb right now.

721
00:30:35,050 --> 00:30:37,757
Not dumb.
Just an unsophisticated reader.

722
00:30:37,834 --> 00:30:39,375
Look, you can't be great
at everything. It's fine.

723
00:30:39,989 --> 00:30:43,115
You know what?
Go pitch your stupid story,

724
00:30:43,139 --> 00:30:45,590
but do not come crying to me
when they "chew it up

725
00:30:45,666 --> 00:30:47,642
and spit it out. Twice."

726
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:54,562
Fletcher's married, Sam.
How could he possibly be serious

727
00:30:54,639 --> 00:30:56,736
about you,
the person he's not married to?

728
00:30:56,771 --> 00:31:00,243
Well, my, uh, new,
insanely beautiful watch

729
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,117
says pretty serious to me.

730
00:31:02,152 --> 00:31:04,247
Mm. "I can't give you my undivided love,

731
00:31:04,324 --> 00:31:06,227
so I'll give you a sparkly timepiece."

732
00:31:06,251 --> 00:31:08,201
Can you please just be supportive?

733
00:31:08,278 --> 00:31:10,161
I really care about him,

734
00:31:10,238 --> 00:31:12,163
and I'm pretty sure that the
whole open marriage situation

735
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,406
won't last long,

736
00:31:13,483 --> 00:31:15,236
which means that the marriage
won't, either.

737
00:31:16,241 --> 00:31:17,919
Fletcher's probably...

738
00:31:17,996 --> 00:31:19,379
<i>totally</i> gonna leave his husband.

739
00:31:19,455 --> 00:31:20,839
He said this?

740
00:31:20,915 --> 00:31:23,383
Or is this just what
you're hoping will happen?

741
00:31:23,384 --> 00:31:25,084
Kirby,

742
00:31:25,116 --> 00:31:27,345
I think I'm falling in love with him.

743
00:31:27,422 --> 00:31:29,189
And I think he's falling in love
with me, too.

744
00:31:37,664 --> 00:31:39,084
Congratulations.

745
00:31:39,119 --> 00:31:40,191
You fooled the hell out of me

746
00:31:40,268 --> 00:31:42,597
with that whole
"Cristal loves pork" thing.

747
00:31:42,621 --> 00:31:44,696
Oh. Must have slipped my
mind that she's allergic.

748
00:31:44,772 --> 00:31:47,268
I should've known better than
to try to get info on Cristal

749
00:31:47,292 --> 00:31:49,042
from such a loyal man.

750
00:31:50,796 --> 00:31:52,732
Is there something I can help you with?

751
00:31:53,449 --> 00:31:55,443
Have Mrs. Gunnerson
prepare you a sandwich?

752
00:31:55,467 --> 00:31:59,210
Do I look like the type of
person who would eat a sandwich?

753
00:31:59,287 --> 00:32:02,116
No, I'm going upstairs to
take Cristal some champagne.

754
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:06,092
Nothing says bonding better
than Cristal and Dom.

755
00:32:06,169 --> 00:32:08,289
Clever.

756
00:32:09,494 --> 00:32:11,273
I'll see you in 20.

757
00:32:14,895 --> 00:32:18,104
Well, I guess I'll see you in 21.

758
00:32:18,181 --> 00:32:19,939
<i>I'm sorry, Adam.</i>

759
00:32:20,016 --> 00:32:21,774
I did everything I could to
get Jeff to give you the money.

760
00:32:21,851 --> 00:32:23,142
It's fine.

761
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:25,640
I hated the idea of owing
him anything anyway, so...

762
00:32:25,664 --> 00:32:28,142
The great news is Jeff
and I have a plan.

763
00:32:28,166 --> 00:32:29,449
And once it goes perfectly,

764
00:32:29,525 --> 00:32:30,979
I will have more than enough money

765
00:32:31,003 --> 00:32:33,745
to buy you a license
in Georgia, Montana.

766
00:32:33,821 --> 00:32:36,623
Hell, I'll buy you a license
in all 50 states.

767
00:32:36,699 --> 00:32:37,916
That's very sweet, Mother.

768
00:32:37,992 --> 00:32:39,959
But that sounds like it'll take time.

769
00:32:40,036 --> 00:32:42,220
My plan is ready to go.

770
00:32:42,297 --> 00:32:43,963
- Do tell.
- So,

771
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,660
I'm gonna sell the
vineyard I bought for Blake

772
00:32:45,684 --> 00:32:47,425
and use that money to pay off whomever

773
00:32:47,502 --> 00:32:49,142
to get my medical license back.

774
00:32:49,177 --> 00:32:51,162
Isn't the vineyard Blake's?

775
00:32:51,239 --> 00:32:52,250
But the deed's in my name.

776
00:32:52,274 --> 00:32:53,431
We never changed it.

777
00:32:53,508 --> 00:32:54,974
So what are you waiting for?

778
00:32:55,051 --> 00:32:56,643
So, while the deed is in my name,

779
00:32:56,719 --> 00:32:58,978
it's also in Blake's office.

780
00:32:59,055 --> 00:33:00,438
In the manor.

781
00:33:00,515 --> 00:33:01,676
Which I'm banned from.

782
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:03,441
But if I can just get my hands on it,

783
00:33:03,518 --> 00:33:05,318
then Blake would have
no recourse when I sell.

784
00:33:05,395 --> 00:33:08,488
Well, maybe there's something I<i> can</i> do.

785
00:33:08,564 --> 00:33:09,569
Nah.

786
00:33:09,616 --> 00:33:11,583
I said "recourse," not "intercourse."

787
00:33:39,479 --> 00:33:42,864
Somebody has a secret lover.

788
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:50,872
Playing hide-and-seek?

789
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:55,085
Kirby, what are you doing here?

790
00:33:55,692 --> 00:33:56,896
I live here.

791
00:33:56,931 --> 00:33:58,871
Question is, what are you doing here?

792
00:33:58,948 --> 00:34:00,206
Clearly not looking for me.

793
00:34:00,283 --> 00:34:01,285
Or texting me.

794
00:34:02,041 --> 00:34:03,537
I feel terrible about that.

795
00:34:03,572 --> 00:34:05,054
- Really?
- That's why I came.

796
00:34:05,121 --> 00:34:06,390
For an in-person apology.

797
00:34:07,466 --> 00:34:08,743
Why should I believe a word you say?

798
00:34:09,382 --> 00:34:11,551
- Why would I lie about being excited to see you?
- Eh.

799
00:34:12,786 --> 00:34:14,721
That does sound like it could be true.

800
00:34:14,797 --> 00:34:16,055
So, should I take you up

801
00:34:16,132 --> 00:34:18,224
to my room and show
you pics of Australia

802
00:34:18,301 --> 00:34:20,184
or just throw you on my bed?

803
00:34:21,128 --> 00:34:24,564
I was thinking about
something a little more...

804
00:34:25,735 --> 00:34:26,824
dangerous.

805
00:34:31,314 --> 00:34:32,747
- How do you get this... Sorry.
- Shut up!

806
00:34:35,827 --> 00:34:36,884
Oh!

807
00:34:44,452 --> 00:34:45,918
That was insane.

808
00:34:45,995 --> 00:34:47,920
Yeah. I've never had anyone do the...

809
00:34:47,997 --> 00:34:49,139
I learned that in Montana.

810
00:34:49,215 --> 00:34:50,618
Ah. Bear country.

811
00:34:50,642 --> 00:34:52,050
- Mm-hmm.
- That makes sense.

812
00:34:52,126 --> 00:34:53,643
Yeah.

813
00:34:56,768 --> 00:34:59,293
This has to be the last time we do this.

814
00:34:59,317 --> 00:35:01,881
It's just... it's-it's too complicated

815
00:35:01,916 --> 00:35:03,131
and... messy.

816
00:35:03,155 --> 00:35:05,466
Yeah. I agree.

817
00:35:05,490 --> 00:35:07,065
Except not really.

818
00:35:07,961 --> 00:35:08,970
You should go first. All right?

819
00:35:10,512 --> 00:35:12,445
I'm not going anywhere until you tell me
why you're really here.

820
00:35:13,182 --> 00:35:14,726
Well, I know it wasn't to see me.

821
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:17,417
Or even to see me naked.

822
00:35:21,965 --> 00:35:24,624
I'm here for the deed to the vineyard,

823
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:25,958
and I found it.

824
00:35:26,035 --> 00:35:27,418
Good for you.

825
00:35:27,495 --> 00:35:29,846
But you know if you need
something stolen from the manor,

826
00:35:29,923 --> 00:35:31,222
you can always just ask me.

827
00:35:35,187 --> 00:35:37,165
Fallon.

828
00:35:37,189 --> 00:35:38,638
Welcome to London.

829
00:35:38,714 --> 00:35:40,059
What are you doing here?

830
00:35:40,083 --> 00:35:42,559
Did they already reject
your pitch in record time?

831
00:35:42,594 --> 00:35:44,176
I wish I could say I was sorry, but...

832
00:35:44,211 --> 00:35:47,438
I didn't go. See, I had to tell you
the real end of the story.

833
00:35:47,515 --> 00:35:50,274
The P.I. had the Peach
Diamond the whole time.

834
00:35:51,203 --> 00:35:52,702
Okay, you know
how confused I was before?

835
00:35:52,779 --> 00:35:53,945
Well, this isn't helping.

836
00:35:54,021 --> 00:35:55,349
Can I please go in the room now?

837
00:35:56,418 --> 00:35:57,582
Sure.

838
00:36:10,171 --> 00:36:11,245
What?

839
00:36:18,106 --> 00:36:19,143
No.

840
00:36:19,789 --> 00:36:21,940
Can I at least ask the question first?

841
00:36:28,556 --> 00:36:30,718
Fallon Carrington,

842
00:36:31,891 --> 00:36:32,920
will you marry me?

843
00:36:33,895 --> 00:36:36,557
No. Wait. Not until you tell me
what the hell is going on here.

844
00:36:36,581 --> 00:36:37,892
Well, I just proposed to you.

845
00:36:39,103 --> 00:36:40,366
There's no pitch.

846
00:36:40,443 --> 00:36:42,001
I made the story up on the plane.

847
00:36:44,113 --> 00:36:46,038
I saw your ring yesterday,

848
00:36:47,290 --> 00:36:49,709
and I wanted to be the one
to propose to you this time.

849
00:36:49,785 --> 00:36:52,679
Wait, you knew I was about to
propose and you didn't let me?

850
00:36:54,123 --> 00:36:55,743
That's so rude.

851
00:36:55,767 --> 00:36:58,079
See, I knew if you were pissed off
at me, you wouldn't propose,

852
00:36:58,103 --> 00:37:01,721
so I pretended like you
didn't understand the story,

853
00:37:01,797 --> 00:37:05,183
because I know you like to be
the smartest person in the room.

854
00:37:05,259 --> 00:37:07,685
Well, I don't like it.
It's more of a curse, really.

855
00:37:07,762 --> 00:37:09,228
And it worked.

856
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,356
You're surprised.

857
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:19,030
So, what do you say?

858
00:37:19,106 --> 00:37:20,990
"Let's run away together, baby.

859
00:37:21,067 --> 00:37:22,517
Me and you."

860
00:37:26,256 --> 00:37:27,729
"Till the end of time."

861
00:37:38,171 --> 00:37:41,492
I'm worried about my friend Sam.
He's falling in love with you,

862
00:37:41,569 --> 00:37:43,661
and he thinks the feeling is mutual.

863
00:37:43,738 --> 00:37:46,330
He's right. I'm crazy about him.

864
00:37:46,407 --> 00:37:47,999
Never met anybody like Sam.

865
00:37:48,075 --> 00:37:51,294
He's so fun but also amazingly deep

866
00:37:51,370 --> 00:37:53,045
and gentle.

867
00:37:53,522 --> 00:37:54,532
And hot.

868
00:37:55,613 --> 00:37:55,965
Oh.

869
00:37:56,042 --> 00:37:58,342
So if you came here to get
me to dump him, no way.

870
00:37:58,419 --> 00:38:00,636
I didn't come here to get
you to break up with him.

871
00:38:00,713 --> 00:38:02,305
I came here to get you
to be honest with him

872
00:38:02,381 --> 00:38:03,639
about where this is going.

873
00:38:03,716 --> 00:38:06,976
And if you really think
he's that special,

874
00:38:07,053 --> 00:38:09,215
you need to do the right thing,

875
00:38:09,239 --> 00:38:11,614
no matter how hard it is.

876
00:38:14,703 --> 00:38:16,360
Mm-hmm.

877
00:38:17,506 --> 00:38:18,696
I paid you half when we met in Mexico.

878
00:38:18,773 --> 00:38:20,031
Here's the other half.

879
00:38:20,786 --> 00:38:22,575
Got a picture for me?

880
00:38:22,652 --> 00:38:25,870
This woman killed my
ex-lover and my unborn baby

881
00:38:25,947 --> 00:38:29,373
and tried to put my husband in jail.

882
00:38:29,450 --> 00:38:32,001
There needs to be a
price for her actions.

883
00:38:32,078 --> 00:38:34,387
I'm pretty sure this
is the ultimate price.

884
00:38:40,419 --> 00:38:42,120
Hey.

885
00:38:42,296 --> 00:38:43,888
Hey.

886
00:38:44,577 --> 00:38:45,972
I just talked to Fletcher.

887
00:38:46,007 --> 00:38:47,066
And?

888
00:38:48,427 --> 00:38:49,519
Oh, no.

889
00:38:50,462 --> 00:38:52,280
- He dumped me.
- He did not.

890
00:38:52,306 --> 00:38:53,593
I was there.

891
00:38:55,031 --> 00:38:56,038
What did he say?

892
00:38:56,043 --> 00:38:59,823
Some crap about how his
husband can't handle it

893
00:38:59,858 --> 00:39:00,927
and he's jealous

894
00:39:00,962 --> 00:39:02,532
and that I didn't deserve
to be in the middle

895
00:39:02,608 --> 00:39:03,936
of this messy situation,

896
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,585
which<i> should</i> make me feel better.

897
00:39:07,989 --> 00:39:09,080
But it doesn't.

898
00:39:09,156 --> 00:39:11,249
I'm sorry, Sam.

899
00:39:12,102 --> 00:39:14,260
You deserve so much better than that.

900
00:39:15,981 --> 00:39:17,046
I know.

901
00:39:24,453 --> 00:39:25,496
Hey.

902
00:39:25,856 --> 00:39:28,829
Where have you been?
Your cell kept going to voice mail.

903
00:39:28,864 --> 00:39:31,060
Oh. Um, the battery died.

904
00:39:31,137 --> 00:39:32,436
Sorry about that.

905
00:39:32,513 --> 00:39:34,230
But I'm here now.

906
00:39:34,307 --> 00:39:35,356
Okay...

907
00:39:35,433 --> 00:39:37,086
What are you up to?

908
00:39:38,203 --> 00:39:41,070
I just had to take care of a few
personal things with my family.

909
00:39:41,147 --> 00:39:43,281
But everything's back on track now.

910
00:39:43,357 --> 00:39:45,449
Can I just say how proud I am of you

911
00:39:45,526 --> 00:39:47,627
for not murdering Dominique yet?

912
00:39:50,048 --> 00:39:52,456
I am all about self-control.

913
00:39:54,678 --> 00:39:57,461
Mm. This makes me so happy,

914
00:39:57,538 --> 00:39:59,589
I almost forgot that
I got dumped earlier.

915
00:39:59,665 --> 00:40:01,452
Oh, wait, I got to tell you
the best part of the story.

916
00:40:01,476 --> 00:40:03,593
Oh, you mean the part where
I knew you were gonna propose

917
00:40:03,669 --> 00:40:06,165
and I made sure Fallon got
on that plane to London?

918
00:40:06,189 --> 00:40:07,189
What?

919
00:40:07,256 --> 00:40:08,806
You knew and you didn't tell me?

920
00:40:08,883 --> 00:40:10,586
- Great part.
- Not the best part.

921
00:40:10,621 --> 00:40:11,934
No. The best part being

922
00:40:12,011 --> 00:40:13,673
when you proposed and I said yes, right?

923
00:40:13,697 --> 00:40:16,676
I was thinking more about the
part where I totally fooled you.

924
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:18,010
Right.

925
00:40:18,034 --> 00:40:20,109
But which is the best part of the story

926
00:40:20,186 --> 00:40:22,111
that you'll be telling for decades?

927
00:40:23,127 --> 00:40:24,334
You said yes.

928
00:40:24,369 --> 00:40:25,734
I said yes.

929
00:40:25,769 --> 00:40:27,992
Well, love may not have
worked out for me,

930
00:40:28,069 --> 00:40:29,952
but I could not be happier for you two.

931
00:40:30,029 --> 00:40:32,496
Oh. I'll never dump you, Sam.

932
00:40:32,936 --> 00:40:34,031
Thanks, bro.

933
00:40:36,796 --> 00:40:39,670
Well, I would love to stay
and soak all of this in,

934
00:40:39,747 --> 00:40:42,673
but I do have a
re-engagement party to plan.

935
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:45,204
- Mwah. Let's talk.
- Let's go.

936
00:40:50,216 --> 00:40:52,044
♪ Baby, I need your touch ♪

937
00:40:52,068 --> 00:40:54,046
♪ I wanna lose control... ♪

938
00:41:02,245 --> 00:41:03,453
Heidi?

939
00:41:04,497 --> 00:41:05,725
Hello, Liam.

940
00:41:05,749 --> 00:41:07,406
What are you doing here?

941
00:41:07,483 --> 00:41:09,367
Been a long time, right?

942
00:41:09,443 --> 00:41:10,701
Since Switzerland.

943
00:41:11,716 --> 00:41:13,149
I think the last time we
spoke was when I told you

944
00:41:13,173 --> 00:41:14,881
I was putting the baby up for adoption.

945
00:41:16,259 --> 00:41:18,376
Look, is there something you want?

946
00:41:19,219 --> 00:41:20,253
Something I can help you with?

947
00:41:29,939 --> 00:41:31,314
That's my son, Connor.

948
00:41:32,591 --> 00:41:33,858
Our son, Connor.

949
00:41:35,612 --> 00:41:37,487
It's time he meets his father.

950
