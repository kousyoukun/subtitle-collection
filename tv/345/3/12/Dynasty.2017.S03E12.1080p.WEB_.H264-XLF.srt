1
00:00:01,084 --> 00:00:03,585
- <i>Previously</i> on Dynasty...
- I am moving out of the manor.

2
00:00:03,628 --> 00:00:05,546
Even if you're losing Blake,
you still got me.

3
00:00:06,055 --> 00:00:09,056
- You poisoned him?
- I lost control of my life

4
00:00:09,091 --> 00:00:10,593
when I lost Carrington Atlantic.

5
00:00:10,634 --> 00:00:12,262
If I advise the board to sell...

6
00:00:12,303 --> 00:00:13,721
I think we can discuss that.

7
00:00:28,236 --> 00:00:31,530
Was there anything else? Or anyone else?

8
00:00:31,573 --> 00:00:33,866
I guess not. Looks like it's just me.

9
00:00:33,908 --> 00:00:35,409
Enjoy, sir.

10
00:00:35,451 --> 00:00:37,078
Actually, there is something I need.

11
00:00:37,889 --> 00:00:40,414
I've decided to take control
of my life once again, Anders,

12
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:42,750
which means getting
Carrington Atlantic back.

13
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:47,088
You mentioned that. #Goals, as they say.

14
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:49,173
You know, I've allowed
my family to push me out,

15
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:52,386
but Carrington Atlantic is my
legacy and it always has been.

16
00:00:52,421 --> 00:00:53,427
Unfortunately, it's part

17
00:00:53,469 --> 00:00:56,389
of Van Kirk Industries,
who just received an offer

18
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:57,765
from an Oakley Corp.

19
00:00:57,807 --> 00:00:59,267
I've never heard of Oakley Corp.

20
00:00:59,308 --> 00:01:01,518
Find out who's behind it,
as well as their offer.

21
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:03,173
Maybe I can outbid them

22
00:01:03,208 --> 00:01:05,689
before it goes before the
VKI board for approval.

23
00:01:05,731 --> 00:01:08,442
Very well. Bon appétit.

24
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,400
What's your hurry? Join me.

25
00:01:11,133 --> 00:01:12,739
Cristal's visiting family in Mexico,

26
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:14,990
Sam's always at the hotel working,

27
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:17,911
Fallon moved out, and Adam...

28
00:01:17,951 --> 00:01:20,287
Was kicked out by you.

29
00:01:20,329 --> 00:01:22,748
Perhaps a miscalculation on your part.

30
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:25,293
The point is,
I wouldn't mind some company.

31
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:26,628
We could really catch up,

32
00:01:26,668 --> 00:01:28,629
just... talk.

33
00:01:43,586 --> 00:01:44,896
I assume we're done here, sir?

34
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:46,563
Yeah, I think so.

35
00:01:51,316 --> 00:01:52,327
Damn.

36
00:01:52,952 --> 00:01:54,197
I should go away on
more writing retreats.

37
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:57,916
You know, there's something
hot about hotel sex.

38
00:01:58,008 --> 00:01:59,392
Must be the change of scenery,

39
00:01:59,427 --> 00:02:03,057
or the minibar stocked
with overpriced chocolates.

40
00:02:03,092 --> 00:02:04,306
I got to say,
I never thought I'd see the day

41
00:02:04,348 --> 00:02:06,017
when you call it quits at the manor.

42
00:02:07,128 --> 00:02:10,687
Well, let's just say that Blake
and I are on a sabbatical,

43
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:13,900
but this one is permanent.

44
00:02:13,941 --> 00:02:16,818
Although, hotel life
is getting a bit mundane.

45
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:18,821
Well, there is always my place.

46
00:02:18,863 --> 00:02:22,157
What? And sleep in the same
bed as that pop-tart Ashley?

47
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:25,286
No. I'd rather wear
low-rise jeans to brunch.

48
00:02:25,328 --> 00:02:26,761
Besides,

49
00:02:26,796 --> 00:02:29,206
it doesn't matter because
I won't be here for long.

50
00:02:29,247 --> 00:02:32,501
I... am gonna buy a house.

51
00:02:32,542 --> 00:02:35,670
Wow. Congratulations.

52
00:02:35,712 --> 00:02:38,174
Isn't that something we
should've talked about together?

53
00:02:38,215 --> 00:02:39,341
Oh, no, no, no, silly.

54
00:02:39,383 --> 00:02:41,176
I'm buying a house for me, not for us.

55
00:02:41,218 --> 00:02:43,554
I figured, I've never lived alone,
and so it's something

56
00:02:43,596 --> 00:02:46,223
I should probably experience
at least once in my life.

57
00:02:46,264 --> 00:02:48,476
- You know, people do live alone.
- Yeah, I've heard.

58
00:02:48,518 --> 00:02:50,102
I-I guess I just thought we were more

59
00:02:50,143 --> 00:02:52,062
on the path of living together.

60
00:02:52,103 --> 00:02:55,900
Don't worry, okay?
This is just a stop on my life journey,

61
00:02:55,941 --> 00:02:58,109
not the final destination, all right?

62
00:02:58,151 --> 00:03:02,448
Besides, I am going to need your
help once I start the search.

63
00:03:03,238 --> 00:03:05,200
Mm. Done.

64
00:03:10,121 --> 00:03:12,708
I thought you already got
your treatment this week.

65
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,668
Just getting a little extra boost.

66
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:16,253
- I'll be fine.
- Actually, I had hoped

67
00:03:16,294 --> 00:03:18,631
your toxic metal levels
would be lower by now.

68
00:03:18,673 --> 00:03:21,341
- So much for doctor-patient confidentiality.
- Sorry.

69
00:03:21,383 --> 00:03:23,593
Let's just not overdo things, okay?

70
00:03:23,636 --> 00:03:25,137
I'll see you next week.

71
00:03:26,429 --> 00:03:28,098
I am concerned.

72
00:03:28,139 --> 00:03:30,393
What if these treatments stop working?

73
00:03:30,434 --> 00:03:32,477
There has to be something else we can do

74
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,437
to stop this wretched disease.

75
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:36,315
Trust me, I've been looking into it.

76
00:03:36,357 --> 00:03:39,818
I even found this pharmaceutical
company named Chlorcyte Health.

77
00:03:39,859 --> 00:03:42,238
They've been working on a
drug to cure neurotoxicity.

78
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,322
- And?
- And they think

79
00:03:43,364 --> 00:03:45,240
it'll be at least five to ten years

80
00:03:45,282 --> 00:03:47,243
before they have anything
to take to the FDA.

81
00:03:47,285 --> 00:03:49,745
They're not putting much
money into the research.

82
00:03:49,787 --> 00:03:51,580
They said it's, uh, not a priority.

83
00:03:51,621 --> 00:03:53,374
So all we have to do is buy the company

84
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:55,209
and very quickly make it a priority.

85
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:57,085
What?

86
00:03:57,127 --> 00:03:58,962
I'm a Colby now, I think big.

87
00:03:59,005 --> 00:04:02,257
Well, hey, it means a lot that you care,

88
00:04:02,299 --> 00:04:03,758
especially considering our marriage

89
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,345
- is just a business arrangement.
- True, but if we're

90
00:04:06,387 --> 00:04:10,098
being honest, my bedroom has
been a little lonely at night.

91
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:11,851
Should you ever want to join me,

92
00:04:11,892 --> 00:04:14,853
we can always expand
our current agreement.

93
00:04:14,894 --> 00:04:18,357
Well, I appreciate the offer,
but I need to focus on my health

94
00:04:18,398 --> 00:04:21,902
while we wait for Van Kirk to
approve our purchase of C.A.

95
00:04:21,943 --> 00:04:24,487
I'll set a meeting tomorrow
about buying Chlorcyte.

96
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:27,491
Oh, Jeff's buying you companies already?

97
00:04:27,532 --> 00:04:30,035
Is that the typical two
weeks of marriage gift?

98
00:04:30,076 --> 00:04:32,955
I figured it would be a
set of knives or something.

99
00:04:32,996 --> 00:04:34,164
No, Dominique, no knives,

100
00:04:34,205 --> 00:04:36,792
though I do wish one
was handy right now.

101
00:04:36,833 --> 00:04:38,628
Mom, what are you doing here?

102
00:04:38,669 --> 00:04:40,837
I just got in from New York,
wanted to say hello.

103
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:42,797
Oh, well, did you lose your phone?

104
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,092
And I was also thinking
that maybe I would stay here

105
00:04:45,133 --> 00:04:47,177
- for a while, to look after you.
- Here?

106
00:04:47,219 --> 00:04:48,290
In this house?

107
00:04:48,679 --> 00:04:49,804
Dominique,

108
00:04:49,847 --> 00:04:51,097
your wit knows no bounds.

109
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:53,559
- I wasn't joking.
- Neither am I.

110
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,020
You and your bargain
basement wig collection

111
00:04:56,061 --> 00:04:57,647
can go find a one-bedroom in Norcross

112
00:04:57,688 --> 00:04:59,230
because you are not staying here.

113
00:04:59,273 --> 00:05:01,150
Okay, okay, uh,

114
00:05:01,191 --> 00:05:02,734
you heard her.

115
00:05:02,777 --> 00:05:04,320
Happy wife, happy life, right?

116
00:05:04,362 --> 00:05:06,864
It's best you find
someplace else to go, Mom.

117
00:05:20,459 --> 00:05:21,597
Hey, stranger.

118
00:05:21,632 --> 00:05:24,297
Hey-hey. Kirby. What brings you around?

119
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:27,258
I know it's a long shot,
but I seem to have lost an earring.

120
00:05:27,301 --> 00:05:28,927
- Did you find one here the other night?
- I was wondering

121
00:05:28,969 --> 00:05:30,845
where that came from.
It's right there on the table.

122
00:05:30,888 --> 00:05:31,931
Oh, my gosh.

123
00:05:31,972 --> 00:05:33,181
I can't believe you found it.

124
00:05:33,224 --> 00:05:34,557
I thought it was gone forever.

125
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,803
You know,
it's actually a really funny story

126
00:05:35,838 --> 00:05:37,520
about these earrings,
they're part of a lucky pair...

127
00:05:37,561 --> 00:05:39,688
I'm-I'm really sorry,
I-I can't stay and chat.

128
00:05:39,729 --> 00:05:41,482
I have a meeting at Atlanta General.

129
00:05:41,523 --> 00:05:42,650
Oh, I didn't realize.

130
00:05:42,691 --> 00:05:44,068
I'm trying to get my privileges there,

131
00:05:44,109 --> 00:05:45,634
- so I can practice medicine again.
- Cool.

132
00:05:45,669 --> 00:05:48,030
Yeah, I'm-I'm running late for a thing,
too, you know.

133
00:05:48,071 --> 00:05:50,366
I'm b-busy, busy.

134
00:05:50,407 --> 00:05:53,703
By the way, I had such a great
time at dinner the other night.

135
00:05:53,744 --> 00:05:55,578
Yeah? Me, too.

136
00:05:55,621 --> 00:05:57,205
- Really?
- Yeah.

137
00:05:57,248 --> 00:06:00,667
- I-I got to run, but I'll-I'll see you around.
- Yeah.

138
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:02,319
See-see you around.

139
00:06:05,588 --> 00:06:08,217
A formal dining room that only seats 16?

140
00:06:08,258 --> 00:06:09,926
I mean, do people not entertain anymore?

141
00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:13,556
- Ugh, I know, right?
- Oh, my God. What-what is this?

142
00:06:13,597 --> 00:06:15,015
Carpeting? I mean, who has carpeting

143
00:06:15,056 --> 00:06:17,893
in their house these days?
Savages. Next!

144
00:06:17,934 --> 00:06:18,993
Fallon?

145
00:06:19,653 --> 00:06:22,480
Hi. Jax Davis.
You must be one of the new interns.

146
00:06:22,523 --> 00:06:24,191
Down, boy, he's with me.

147
00:06:24,232 --> 00:06:27,236
What are you doing?
I-I thought we were going house hunting.

148
00:06:27,277 --> 00:06:31,198
Oh, no, we are. It's just that
open houses are for peasants.

149
00:06:31,239 --> 00:06:34,325
Who has the time?
This way, the market comes to me.

150
00:06:34,368 --> 00:06:37,162
Laminate flooring?
This place should be condemned. Next.

151
00:06:37,941 --> 00:06:39,039
Hey, Fallon.

152
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,708
I-I agreed I'd help you look
for a new house, all right,

153
00:06:41,751 --> 00:06:44,503
not watch you walk around
and bump into furniture.

154
00:06:44,544 --> 00:06:46,922
It's all right. I'm done anyway.

155
00:06:46,963 --> 00:06:50,176
This virtual tour was a
giant waste of real time.

156
00:06:50,217 --> 00:06:52,720
There's one listing not online.

157
00:06:52,761 --> 00:06:55,560
Classic colonial in the Wrightwood area.

158
00:06:55,595 --> 00:06:57,640
- Ooh.
- Has its own peach tree farm.

159
00:06:57,682 --> 00:06:58,865
Little on the nose, but whatevs.

160
00:06:58,965 --> 00:07:01,936
Wait, wait, wait.
Is this the house on the lake?

161
00:07:02,361 --> 00:07:04,482
With sweeping views?

162
00:07:04,523 --> 00:07:06,650
- 525 Wrightwood Drive?
- That's the one.

163
00:07:06,691 --> 00:07:08,652
Oh, my God, I can't believe it.
It's fate.

164
00:07:08,693 --> 00:07:12,239
I used to go by this house
all the time when I was a kid.

165
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:15,190
- Sounds great. We should go look at it.
- No, no.

166
00:07:15,225 --> 00:07:16,326
We don't need to look at it.
It's perfect.

167
00:07:16,368 --> 00:07:18,203
I know that I want it, so get it for me.

168
00:07:18,244 --> 00:07:21,331
The owner's not accepting offers
until the open house later today.

169
00:07:21,373 --> 00:07:24,710
Well, I guess we're going
on a road trip after all.

170
00:07:25,461 --> 00:07:29,297
Well, at least I know you'll
never leave me, huh? Yeah.

171
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:31,508
Sorry for the delay, sir.

172
00:07:31,549 --> 00:07:34,386
My contacts at VKI are
a little tight-lipped

173
00:07:34,427 --> 00:07:36,429
about the sale of Carrington Atlantic.

174
00:07:36,472 --> 00:07:38,765
Certainly was easier when
Fallon and Liam lived here.

175
00:07:38,807 --> 00:07:41,143
Had a direct line of access
to the Van Kirk family.

176
00:07:41,184 --> 00:07:42,331
What'd you find out about the bid?

177
00:07:42,366 --> 00:07:45,480
Oh, it's sealed. However,
if you really want to know about that,

178
00:07:45,523 --> 00:07:47,982
you can always ask the
owner of Oakley Corp.

179
00:07:49,068 --> 00:07:50,486
- Jeff Colby.
- What?

180
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:52,278
- Are you sure?
- I'm afraid so, sir.

181
00:07:52,321 --> 00:07:54,532
Jeff and Alexis failed to
have you put in prison,

182
00:07:54,573 --> 00:07:57,116
so they've moved on to
the next best thing.

183
00:07:57,158 --> 00:07:58,910
Now they want your company.

184
00:08:00,912 --> 00:08:05,042
So... battle lines have been drawn.

185
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:08,671
Well, if it's war they want,
it's war they'll get.

186
00:08:34,952 --> 00:08:37,532
Can you please go be Valentine's-y

187
00:08:37,575 --> 00:08:38,658
in the lounge or something?

188
00:08:39,418 --> 00:08:41,119
Thank you.

189
00:08:42,219 --> 00:08:44,956
Wow. Someone's feeling the love. You got

190
00:08:44,999 --> 00:08:47,417
special plans for you and
Fletcher's first V-Day together?

191
00:08:48,697 --> 00:08:51,379
Well, actually,
he's away on Atlantix business.

192
00:08:51,422 --> 00:08:52,065
Aw.

193
00:08:52,089 --> 00:08:54,550
Which is totally fine
because I'll be busy hosting

194
00:08:54,591 --> 00:08:56,676
La Mirage's "Secret Admirer" party.

195
00:08:56,719 --> 00:08:58,177
Ooh, do tell.

196
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:00,973
People send out an anonymous
letter to someone special,

197
00:09:01,014 --> 00:09:02,304
hoping that person will show up

198
00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:05,143
to find their admirer.
Then they meet, fall in love,

199
00:09:05,185 --> 00:09:07,771
book a hotel room, everyone wins.

200
00:09:07,812 --> 00:09:09,134
That sounds really romantic.

201
00:09:09,169 --> 00:09:12,234
Unless, of course,
the person you invite doesn't show up.

202
00:09:12,276 --> 00:09:13,985
Then... then that's sad for you.

203
00:09:14,027 --> 00:09:15,336
Are you sending that to someone?

204
00:09:15,371 --> 00:09:18,990
If you must know,
I'm crushing a little on Adam.

205
00:09:19,032 --> 00:09:22,076
Please tell me you mean
Adam Levine or Adam Sandler.

206
00:09:22,119 --> 00:09:24,412
I'll even accept a misguided
attempt at Adam Lambert.

207
00:09:24,455 --> 00:09:27,416
- Adam Carrington.
- What, what's the...?

208
00:09:27,457 --> 00:09:30,085
Kirby, what exactly
happened in that cult?

209
00:09:30,127 --> 00:09:32,003
Did Joel brainwash you

210
00:09:32,046 --> 00:09:33,589
into only liking crazy people?

211
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:35,548
First of all, not a cult.

212
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:37,091
Adam may not have the best track record,

213
00:09:37,133 --> 00:09:39,094
but he did come to save me from Synergy,

214
00:09:39,136 --> 00:09:41,971
and he's actually
super charming and fun.

215
00:09:42,013 --> 00:09:43,599
All I'm saying is, this has the makings

216
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:46,100
of a relationship disaster, all right?

217
00:09:46,143 --> 00:09:48,729
Don't ignore the warning signs.

218
00:09:48,771 --> 00:09:50,355
If you feel that strongly about it...

219
00:09:50,397 --> 00:09:51,815
Oh, yes, I do.

220
00:09:51,856 --> 00:09:53,691
And you're welcome.

221
00:09:55,694 --> 00:09:58,071
If you feel that strongly about it,

222
00:09:58,113 --> 00:10:00,114
keep it a secret from you, too.

223
00:10:00,157 --> 00:10:02,033
Look who rolled back into town.

224
00:10:02,075 --> 00:10:03,526
I'd ask if Vanessa was with you,

225
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:06,120
but I'm sure you're working
overtime to keep us apart.

226
00:10:06,162 --> 00:10:08,624
Don't be silly, I'd never do that.

227
00:10:08,666 --> 00:10:10,625
Besides, I couldn't if I wanted to.

228
00:10:10,667 --> 00:10:12,920
Once Jeff and Monica found out
Vanessa was my stepdaughter,

229
00:10:12,961 --> 00:10:14,838
I tossed out the blackmail I had on you.

230
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:18,550
Hmm, how generous.
I guess it doesn't matter.

231
00:10:18,591 --> 00:10:21,762
- Vanessa wants nothing to do with me.
- Oh? You spoke to her?

232
00:10:21,803 --> 00:10:24,473
We texted a lot when she
went back to New York,

233
00:10:24,514 --> 00:10:26,432
but then I mentioned coming to visit,

234
00:10:26,475 --> 00:10:28,978
and things have been
radio silent ever since.

235
00:10:29,018 --> 00:10:30,812
I had no idea.

236
00:10:30,854 --> 00:10:32,480
Although that doesn't surprise me.

237
00:10:32,523 --> 00:10:34,899
I saw her when I was in New York.
She has her own apartment.

238
00:10:34,941 --> 00:10:37,152
Even booked a few nightclub gigs.

239
00:10:37,194 --> 00:10:39,946
I hate to say it, but she's moving on.

240
00:10:39,989 --> 00:10:42,490
Yeah. Without me.

241
00:10:42,532 --> 00:10:44,368
I'm sorry, Michael. Truly.

242
00:10:44,409 --> 00:10:45,869
If it makes you feel any better,

243
00:10:45,911 --> 00:10:48,747
I haven't had the best day either.

244
00:10:48,788 --> 00:10:50,832
Next round on me?

245
00:10:54,795 --> 00:10:58,840
Wow. This place has to have,
what, 15 bedrooms?

246
00:10:59,587 --> 00:11:01,343
Are you sure you'll have enough space?

247
00:11:01,384 --> 00:11:03,345
No, it'll be tight, but I'll manage.

248
00:11:03,387 --> 00:11:06,014
The important thing is
the history of happiness

249
00:11:06,056 --> 00:11:07,265
this house has.

250
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,685
Happiness that I'm sure
will spill onto me.

251
00:11:09,726 --> 00:11:11,478
If they accept your offer.

252
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:15,148
Oh, honey, I'm not worried about that.

253
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:17,776
Let's go, boys!

254
00:11:20,863 --> 00:11:22,321
You know, when making an all-cash offer,

255
00:11:22,364 --> 00:11:25,283
you don't actually have
to have the cash with you.

256
00:11:25,325 --> 00:11:27,036
Well, I don't like to take chances.

257
00:11:27,076 --> 00:11:29,705
And, look, the visual is so impressive.

258
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:32,072
What's going on?

259
00:11:32,107 --> 00:11:33,082
What's happening here?

260
00:11:33,124 --> 00:11:35,252
You said the owner
wasn't accepting offers

261
00:11:35,293 --> 00:11:37,796
before the open house, but nobody said

262
00:11:37,838 --> 00:11:40,173
I couldn't offer at the open house.

263
00:11:40,215 --> 00:11:43,051
Fallon's very talented
in finding loopholes.

264
00:11:43,093 --> 00:11:44,552
Got it.

265
00:11:44,595 --> 00:11:47,221
And that jacket looks great on you.

266
00:11:47,263 --> 00:11:48,815
Thanks. I wasn't sure about it...

267
00:11:48,837 --> 00:11:50,893
Okay, listen, that's enough with
the special <i>Queer Eye</i> episode.

268
00:11:50,934 --> 00:11:52,061
I have a house to buy.

269
00:11:52,101 --> 00:11:53,591
I don't think you understand.

270
00:11:53,626 --> 00:11:56,023
Everyone looking to buy this
house is as rich as you are.

271
00:11:56,065 --> 00:11:57,566
You've got serious competition in there.

272
00:11:57,608 --> 00:12:01,070
Oh, you just said
the magic words, Jaxon.

273
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:03,654
Fallon Carrington
thrives on competition.

274
00:12:06,825 --> 00:12:09,869
It's actually just Jax. No "on."

275
00:12:11,162 --> 00:12:14,082
Blake. What a lovely surprise.

276
00:12:14,124 --> 00:12:15,834
You told security to let me in, Alexis.

277
00:12:15,875 --> 00:12:18,045
- It can't be too surprising.
- True.

278
00:12:18,086 --> 00:12:22,257
So, no Jeff by your side,
feeding you grapes?

279
00:12:22,298 --> 00:12:24,426
He has actual companies to run.

280
00:12:28,305 --> 00:12:30,724
Yeah, I got to tell you,
I'm, I'm actually surprised

281
00:12:30,766 --> 00:12:32,267
you're still here at all.

282
00:12:32,308 --> 00:12:34,769
Well, I know this marriage
was just payment for you

283
00:12:34,811 --> 00:12:36,772
helping him try to put me into prison.

284
00:12:36,813 --> 00:12:38,773
And when that plan failed,
I just assumed

285
00:12:38,816 --> 00:12:40,526
this magical romance would fall apart.

286
00:12:40,566 --> 00:12:41,692
You're wrong.

287
00:12:41,734 --> 00:12:43,611
Jeff and I share a love that is deep.

288
00:12:44,804 --> 00:12:48,282
Only thing you two share
is a pathetic vendetta against me.

289
00:12:48,325 --> 00:12:50,284
I know what you're up to with C.A.

290
00:12:50,326 --> 00:12:51,369
Look,

291
00:12:51,411 --> 00:12:53,247
I don't know what his offer was,

292
00:12:53,287 --> 00:12:54,805
but I'll buy it back with interest.

293
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:58,585
And maybe if you help broker a deal,
you can get a commission.

294
00:12:58,627 --> 00:13:01,463
I mean, that's what you really
want anyway, right? Money?

295
00:13:01,504 --> 00:13:05,801
How sad is this, Blake?

296
00:13:05,843 --> 00:13:08,137
In the past,
you would have sent Fallon or Adam

297
00:13:08,177 --> 00:13:09,638
to do your dirty work.

298
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,695
Clearly you've alienated
yourself from the entire family

299
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:15,601
'cause here you are,
groveling all alone.

300
00:13:15,643 --> 00:13:16,936
I'm hardly groveling.

301
00:13:16,979 --> 00:13:18,354
I understand, though.

302
00:13:18,397 --> 00:13:21,191
You alienated me from
my family for years.

303
00:13:21,233 --> 00:13:23,152
Only I didn't have a choice.

304
00:13:23,192 --> 00:13:25,988
You did this to yourself.

305
00:13:26,989 --> 00:13:29,907
You made a tactical error,

306
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:32,702
aligning your forces with Jeff.

307
00:13:32,744 --> 00:13:35,330
Colbys always lose to Carringtons.

308
00:13:36,384 --> 00:13:37,916
You'll be nothing but a casualty of war.

309
00:13:41,938 --> 00:13:44,380
Lot of potential buyers, Fallon.

310
00:13:44,422 --> 00:13:46,429
What exactly are you gonna do?

311
00:13:46,464 --> 00:13:47,508
You'll see.

312
00:13:47,551 --> 00:13:50,970
I just have to thin out
the competition a little.

313
00:13:51,804 --> 00:13:52,973
I hear one of those floozies

314
00:13:53,014 --> 00:13:55,017
from <i>The Real Housewives</i>
owns this place.

315
00:13:56,188 --> 00:13:57,811
I swear I can smell the stench

316
00:13:57,853 --> 00:14:01,523
of desperation and spray tan.

317
00:14:01,565 --> 00:14:03,691
Oh, you know they filmed
a Marvel movie here.

318
00:14:03,734 --> 00:14:06,027
But I'm sure the sci-fi geeks
only show up for, you know,

319
00:14:06,069 --> 00:14:08,115
Dragon Con, Comic-Con.

320
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:09,822
Pretty much all the Cons.

321
00:14:12,158 --> 00:14:15,494
Double homicide, right here.

322
00:14:15,537 --> 00:14:19,374
Rumor has it there's still
blood under the floorboards.

323
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:22,100
- I heard there was a minor rodent infestation.
- What?

324
00:14:22,188 --> 00:14:24,003
- I'm sure they won't come back.
- Rodents?

325
00:14:24,046 --> 00:14:26,215
Porn house.

326
00:14:26,255 --> 00:14:28,258
Now I'll just turn on
the Carrington charm

327
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,051
with the unsuspecting owner,

328
00:14:30,093 --> 00:14:32,387
and the place will be mine.

329
00:14:33,595 --> 00:14:34,513
Wait, who are these

330
00:14:34,556 --> 00:14:36,057
<i>Town & Country-looking</i>
newcomers, and why

331
00:14:36,099 --> 00:14:37,893
are they hugging that old lady?

332
00:14:37,935 --> 00:14:39,894
Because that old lady

333
00:14:39,936 --> 00:14:42,230
is Esther Winslow, the owner.

334
00:14:43,154 --> 00:14:47,027
She must know that family...
and love them.

335
00:14:47,069 --> 00:14:48,861
You have got to be kidding me.

336
00:14:48,903 --> 00:14:52,287
Well, I guess I'll just have
to destroy a family of four.

337
00:14:52,539 --> 00:14:53,680
Whoa.

338
00:14:53,715 --> 00:14:55,369
You know those kids are,
like, six years old.

339
00:14:55,409 --> 00:14:58,080
All is fair in love and real estate.

340
00:15:02,876 --> 00:15:04,818
Well, it's just not
the same here without you.

341
00:15:04,895 --> 00:15:07,630
I don't understand why you had to
go to Mexico in the first place.

342
00:15:07,672 --> 00:15:10,216
I'll be home before you know it.
Promise.

343
00:15:10,258 --> 00:15:12,219
So how's the Carrington
Atlantic sale going?

344
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:15,180
It's not.
Jeff Colby made an offer first.

345
00:15:15,221 --> 00:15:17,724
He and Alexis think this
is the best way to hurt me.

346
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:20,226
You know, Fallon

347
00:15:20,268 --> 00:15:22,561
has a good relationship with Jeff.

348
00:15:22,604 --> 00:15:24,022
I know things are tense between you two,

349
00:15:24,063 --> 00:15:26,108
but maybe she would talk to him for you.

350
00:15:26,148 --> 00:15:28,317
Yeah, I'm not sure about that.

351
00:15:28,359 --> 00:15:31,946
If nothing else,
it gives you a reason to call her.

352
00:15:31,989 --> 00:15:33,907
I know how much you miss her, Blake.

353
00:15:33,949 --> 00:15:35,825
Don't let your pride stand in the way.

354
00:15:37,827 --> 00:15:40,455
The hospital administrator said
that they have a spot for me,

355
00:15:40,497 --> 00:15:42,374
so I could be practicing
medicine again in no time.

356
00:15:42,416 --> 00:15:43,959
That's fantastic.

357
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,085
And just think, with Jeff
buying a pharmaceutical company,

358
00:15:46,128 --> 00:15:47,421
both of the men

359
00:15:47,461 --> 00:15:49,464
in my life will be working in medicine.

360
00:15:49,505 --> 00:15:52,008
Jeff's buying
a pharmaceutical company? Why?

361
00:15:53,009 --> 00:15:55,470
It's a sound investment.

362
00:15:55,512 --> 00:15:57,681
Everyone needs medicine, right?

363
00:15:58,606 --> 00:16:01,685
Well, I should take my mail
and be going.

364
00:16:02,558 --> 00:16:05,647
Oh. This is for you.

365
00:16:05,689 --> 00:16:06,898
Hmm.

366
00:16:09,026 --> 00:16:10,152
Huh.

367
00:16:10,192 --> 00:16:12,821
That's weird. It's an invitation

368
00:16:12,863 --> 00:16:15,657
to a Valentine's Day party at La Mirage.

369
00:16:15,699 --> 00:16:16,950
From whom?

370
00:16:16,985 --> 00:16:19,619
Doesn't say.
It's from a "secret admirer."

371
00:16:19,661 --> 00:16:22,705
How wonderfully mysterious.

372
00:16:22,748 --> 00:16:24,041
I do hope you'll go.

373
00:16:24,789 --> 00:16:26,353
Practicing medicine is great,

374
00:16:26,388 --> 00:16:28,920
but we can't neglect our personal lives.

375
00:16:28,961 --> 00:16:32,257
I think I will go,
Mother, because I have

376
00:16:32,298 --> 00:16:33,758
a pretty good idea who invited me.

377
00:16:34,373 --> 00:16:38,930
And I watch a $1,500 bottle of champagne

378
00:16:38,971 --> 00:16:41,725
fly out of Blake's hands and shatter.

379
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:45,354
The poor bastard never
got to take a sip.

380
00:16:45,394 --> 00:16:48,606
I haven't laughed this much in years.

381
00:16:48,648 --> 00:16:52,860
Vanessa is crazy to let you go.

382
00:16:52,902 --> 00:16:56,156
Because you, sir, are an amazing man.

383
00:16:56,197 --> 00:16:57,990
Why, thank you, kind lady.

384
00:16:58,032 --> 00:17:03,037
And you are a lot more fun when
you're not blackmailing me.

385
00:17:04,152 --> 00:17:05,206
Okay.

386
00:17:05,247 --> 00:17:10,087
This one is to celebrate
our single status.

387
00:17:10,128 --> 00:17:13,048
Because who needs a plus-one

388
00:17:13,090 --> 00:17:16,551
when we have top-shelf
tequila to keep us company?

389
00:17:16,592 --> 00:17:17,886
- Hear, hear.
- Hear, hear.

390
00:17:17,927 --> 00:17:19,747
To being single.

391
00:17:27,061 --> 00:17:28,522
I should probably call a car.

392
00:17:28,562 --> 00:17:29,981
No, no, no, wait. You can't leave.

393
00:17:30,023 --> 00:17:31,899
The party's just getting started.

394
00:17:31,942 --> 00:17:34,485
Besides, who do you have
to go home to, anyway?

395
00:17:34,527 --> 00:17:36,737
You are right about that.

396
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:39,073
I feel your pain, Michael.

397
00:17:39,116 --> 00:17:43,744
But you don't have to be alone
tonight if you don't want to be.

398
00:18:03,305 --> 00:18:05,350
Hey. Are you ready?

399
00:18:05,391 --> 00:18:07,185
The restaurant we're going
to is supposed to be amazing,

400
00:18:07,226 --> 00:18:09,307
- and I'm starving.
- No time for dinner.

401
00:18:09,342 --> 00:18:11,273
I have to pick out a
gift for Mrs. Winslow.

402
00:18:11,313 --> 00:18:14,275
Do you think Esther would
like an early Easter basket,

403
00:18:14,317 --> 00:18:15,776
maybe filled with Fabergé eggs?

404
00:18:15,819 --> 00:18:16,861
Are you kidding?

405
00:18:16,903 --> 00:18:18,280
You're right. Go more traditional.

406
00:18:18,321 --> 00:18:20,782
How about an original Picasso?

407
00:18:20,823 --> 00:18:22,951
I'll see if I can pull one
from the Carrington vault.

408
00:18:22,993 --> 00:18:24,869
Well, have you considered
doing something more personal?

409
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:26,288
- Huh?
- I meant like

410
00:18:26,329 --> 00:18:27,664
writing a letter, Fallon.

411
00:18:27,705 --> 00:18:29,957
Okay? Tell this woman what
this house means to you.

412
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,752
All right?
What it meant to you as a kid.

413
00:18:32,793 --> 00:18:34,420
Hmm. Yes.

414
00:18:34,463 --> 00:18:36,255
I like it. I like it.

415
00:18:36,298 --> 00:18:37,965
Lean in to the whole

416
00:18:38,007 --> 00:18:40,260
grandmother thing,
really play up the nostalgia.

417
00:18:40,301 --> 00:18:43,472
You know what? Attach it to a
box of hard candies and I'm in.

418
00:18:43,513 --> 00:18:45,307
- There you go.
- This won't take long.

419
00:18:45,348 --> 00:18:47,516
I will meet you at the restaurant.

420
00:18:48,517 --> 00:18:49,644
Oh. Hi.

421
00:18:49,686 --> 00:18:50,741
Leaving so soon?

422
00:18:50,776 --> 00:18:54,940
We're late for dinner.
Don't want to lose our reservation.

423
00:18:54,983 --> 00:18:56,150
So, I have some news.

424
00:18:56,193 --> 00:18:57,485
No, no, no, no. Not now.

425
00:18:57,526 --> 00:18:58,580
I am in the zone.

426
00:18:58,615 --> 00:19:00,030
You may need to get out of the zone.

427
00:19:00,071 --> 00:19:02,198
I just got off the phone
with Winslow's broker,

428
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,249
and there's been a twist.

429
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:07,161
Turns out, the old lady only
wants to sell to a family.

430
00:19:07,204 --> 00:19:08,914
- What?
- I know.

431
00:19:08,955 --> 00:19:10,122
I guess she was raised in that house

432
00:19:10,165 --> 00:19:11,453
and raised her own family there,

433
00:19:11,488 --> 00:19:13,792
wants the tradition to continue,
blah, blah, blah.

434
00:19:13,834 --> 00:19:16,128
I can't believe it.
This is discrimination.

435
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:18,340
We should call the ACLU.

436
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:19,424
I say we move on.

437
00:19:20,382 --> 00:19:22,176
No.

438
00:19:22,218 --> 00:19:24,513
I'm not giving up.

439
00:19:24,553 --> 00:19:26,180
Not yet.

440
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:29,850
Dominique.

441
00:19:29,892 --> 00:19:31,144
Thank you for coming.

442
00:19:31,186 --> 00:19:32,853
Though you certainly took your time.

443
00:19:32,896 --> 00:19:34,981
Sorry I missed your call,
but I was tied up at the time.

444
00:19:35,023 --> 00:19:39,026
So, what did I do to deserve a
summons from Blake Carrington?

445
00:19:39,069 --> 00:19:41,696
Absolutely nothing.

446
00:19:42,952 --> 00:19:44,241
- Yet.
- Hmm.

447
00:19:44,282 --> 00:19:46,670
Thought I'd mix things up for a change.

448
00:19:46,705 --> 00:19:48,536
I need a favor from you.

449
00:19:48,578 --> 00:19:51,121
Of course, I'll pay handsomely.

450
00:19:51,164 --> 00:19:53,600
And what exactly does this favor entail?

451
00:19:53,635 --> 00:19:56,168
Simple. You have access
to Jeff's house. I need inside.

452
00:19:56,211 --> 00:19:58,069
Specifically his office.

453
00:19:58,104 --> 00:19:59,687
He's trying to buy Carrington Atlantic,

454
00:19:59,722 --> 00:20:01,507
and I need to find out
whatever I can about his plan.

455
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:03,467
So...

456
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:06,471
can I count on you? Sis?

457
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:09,724
Jeff and Alexis have a
meeting tomorrow afternoon,

458
00:20:09,765 --> 00:20:11,057
so they'll be gone.

459
00:20:11,092 --> 00:20:13,686
I can meet you there then
and get you past security.

460
00:20:13,727 --> 00:20:15,105
- That's perfect.
- However,

461
00:20:15,146 --> 00:20:16,564
if I do this, I'm going to want

462
00:20:16,606 --> 00:20:19,442
something more than money in return.

463
00:20:20,734 --> 00:20:22,153
Much more.

464
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:29,953
Good news. I just talked to Jax.

465
00:20:29,994 --> 00:20:32,746
The letter to Mrs. Winslow worked.
I am back in the game.

466
00:20:32,789 --> 00:20:34,748
See? I told you.

467
00:20:34,791 --> 00:20:36,584
Sometimes it just takes a
personal touch with people.

468
00:20:36,626 --> 00:20:37,752
Right. A personal touch,

469
00:20:37,793 --> 00:20:40,170
with just a tiny bit of embellishment.

470
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:42,340
How tiny?

471
00:20:42,381 --> 00:20:44,341
Oh, it's really not a big deal.

472
00:20:44,384 --> 00:20:47,094
Mrs. Winslow just wants to meet me.

473
00:20:47,137 --> 00:20:48,679
And my husband and my children.

474
00:20:48,722 --> 00:20:49,956
Why would you do that?

475
00:20:49,991 --> 00:20:52,183
Well, she said
she wanted to sell to a family.

476
00:20:52,225 --> 00:20:53,392
So you just invented one?

477
00:20:53,435 --> 00:20:54,773
I panicked. Okay?

478
00:20:54,808 --> 00:20:56,896
I didn't think she would
actually want to meet everybody.

479
00:20:56,937 --> 00:20:58,939
Anyway,
we're all invited over there tonight.

480
00:20:58,982 --> 00:21:01,150
All of who?

481
00:21:01,192 --> 00:21:02,234
You don't actually have children.

482
00:21:02,276 --> 00:21:03,778
Fallon, we're not even married.

483
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:06,113
Well... technicalities.

484
00:21:06,156 --> 00:21:08,073
Look, if you just want to
check off the homeowner box,

485
00:21:08,116 --> 00:21:09,951
there are other places you can buy.

486
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:13,288
Why is this house so important?

487
00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:14,747
Because it just is.

488
00:21:14,789 --> 00:21:17,125
Look, I know it sounds weird,

489
00:21:17,167 --> 00:21:19,084
but this house saved
me when I was a kid.

490
00:21:19,127 --> 00:21:21,545
When Alexis and Blake would be fighting,

491
00:21:21,588 --> 00:21:24,424
I would just sneak over there,
and I would peak in the window,

492
00:21:24,465 --> 00:21:27,135
just to get an idea of what
a happy family was like.

493
00:21:27,176 --> 00:21:29,428
And they ate dinner together
and they played charades

494
00:21:29,471 --> 00:21:32,098
and had movie nights, and...
I don't know.

495
00:21:32,139 --> 00:21:35,392
Seeing a real family made me realize

496
00:21:35,435 --> 00:21:37,811
that things could be different.
Or better.

497
00:21:38,812 --> 00:21:40,482
I know it sounds crazy.

498
00:21:40,523 --> 00:21:43,025
No, it doesn't sound crazy.

499
00:21:43,068 --> 00:21:46,949
Crazy is accepting an invitation
for a family you don't have.

500
00:21:46,984 --> 00:21:48,822
You have to tell Mrs. Winslow the truth.

501
00:21:48,865 --> 00:21:50,347
All right, who knows,
maybe she'll appreciate

502
00:21:50,382 --> 00:21:51,996
the honesty,
and you'll still get the place.

503
00:21:52,031 --> 00:21:54,579
You're right. I should go talk to her.

504
00:21:55,538 --> 00:21:57,165
But you're coming with me.

505
00:21:59,762 --> 00:22:00,877
You could have removed the spare tire

506
00:22:00,918 --> 00:22:02,587
before forcing me in the trunk.

507
00:22:02,628 --> 00:22:05,340
Just be glad I got you past the gate.

508
00:22:05,381 --> 00:22:07,007
I told Jeff's head of security

509
00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:09,301
that I was going to pick up
some things I left in my room.

510
00:22:09,343 --> 00:22:11,804
Well, with any luck,
this won't take me long.

511
00:22:11,846 --> 00:22:13,430
I'll stand watch outside.

512
00:22:26,735 --> 00:22:28,362
Excuse me, is there a problem?

513
00:22:28,405 --> 00:22:30,031
Ms. Deveraux,
the door alarm on Mr. Colby's office

514
00:22:30,072 --> 00:22:32,157
- just went off.
- Oh. I'm sorry.

515
00:22:32,199 --> 00:22:33,868
That was me. I went in to get a bottle

516
00:22:33,909 --> 00:22:35,536
of champagne off Jeff's bar.

517
00:22:35,578 --> 00:22:37,288
- No harm, no foul.
- I see.

518
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:38,790
Well, still, no one's allowed in there,

519
00:22:38,831 --> 00:22:40,291
so I'll have to let Mr. Colby know

520
00:22:40,332 --> 00:22:43,211
- when he returns.
- You're certainly devoted.

521
00:22:43,962 --> 00:22:46,004
Duane, is it?

522
00:22:46,047 --> 00:22:48,261
But here's the thing, Duane.
I'd hate to call my son

523
00:22:48,296 --> 00:22:51,176
and tell him that in fact you
were the one in his office,

524
00:22:51,218 --> 00:22:53,554
rifling through his desk,
drinking from his bar,

525
00:22:53,596 --> 00:22:55,432
- reeking of alcohol...
- He wouldn't believe that.

526
00:22:56,933 --> 00:22:58,810
I think he might.

527
00:22:59,769 --> 00:23:02,147
Make it quick, all right?

528
00:23:02,187 --> 00:23:03,323
Crazy...

529
00:23:16,953 --> 00:23:18,204
What's going on?

530
00:23:18,245 --> 00:23:20,540
I followed Jeff and
Alexis as instructed.

531
00:23:20,581 --> 00:23:22,458
They had some sort of a
meeting at Chlorcyte Health.

532
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,878
Chlorcyte? The big pharma company?

533
00:23:24,918 --> 00:23:26,337
Why would they be
having a meeting there?

534
00:23:26,378 --> 00:23:28,046
Well, your guess is as good as mine.

535
00:23:28,089 --> 00:23:30,382
But they're done now
and they're leaving.

536
00:23:30,425 --> 00:23:32,635
You should vacate the premises.

537
00:23:46,584 --> 00:23:47,824
Wow.

538
00:23:47,984 --> 00:23:49,276
Fun idea for a party, huh?

539
00:23:49,319 --> 00:23:50,486
You're here.

540
00:23:51,376 --> 00:23:52,471
I mean, you're here.

541
00:23:52,678 --> 00:23:54,873
So, did you, uh,
send an invite or receive one?

542
00:23:54,892 --> 00:23:56,784
Recipient. And very flattered.

543
00:23:56,826 --> 00:23:58,953
Really?

544
00:23:58,994 --> 00:24:01,205
Do you feel the same
way about your admirer?

545
00:24:01,246 --> 00:24:02,791
I think I do.

546
00:24:02,831 --> 00:24:03,960
I mean, I haven't seen Nadia

547
00:24:03,995 --> 00:24:06,293
in a while,
but we've texted a few times.

548
00:24:07,814 --> 00:24:08,818
Nadia?

549
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:09,848
Wait, you mean your nurse?

550
00:24:09,883 --> 00:24:11,465
I know she feels bad
about how things ended,

551
00:24:11,507 --> 00:24:13,967
and I think this is her
way of trying to reach out.

552
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:15,302
Hoping to reconnect, you know?

553
00:24:15,344 --> 00:24:17,805
Yeah. Yeah.

554
00:24:17,847 --> 00:24:19,974
I bet you're right.

555
00:24:20,015 --> 00:24:21,850
- I'm sure she'll be here soon.
- Thanks.

556
00:24:21,892 --> 00:24:23,477
I-I'm gonna go look for her.

557
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,647
Okay.

558
00:24:25,687 --> 00:24:26,856
I'll be here.

559
00:24:26,898 --> 00:24:28,524
Feeling like a moron.

560
00:24:29,567 --> 00:24:30,819
Hi!

561
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:32,986
Fallon?

562
00:24:33,029 --> 00:24:33,987
Why are you driving a minivan?

563
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:36,115
- And what are you wearing?
- Oh.

564
00:24:36,157 --> 00:24:39,577
I had no idea how comfortable
polyblend sweaters were.

565
00:24:39,619 --> 00:24:40,975
- Hmm.
- I decided

566
00:24:41,010 --> 00:24:42,996
that the truth just wasn't
the best way to play this.

567
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:44,666
So you think that showing up

568
00:24:44,706 --> 00:24:46,583
in a minivan dressed as a soccer mom's

569
00:24:46,626 --> 00:24:48,293
gonna convince her you have a family?

570
00:24:48,336 --> 00:24:50,839
Of course not.
But you and the two kids will.

571
00:24:50,879 --> 00:24:52,005
What two ki...?

572
00:24:53,058 --> 00:24:54,634
Oh, my God, what did you do?

573
00:24:54,676 --> 00:24:55,843
Did you buy two kids from someone?

574
00:24:55,885 --> 00:24:58,218
What? No. Don't be ridiculous.

575
00:24:58,253 --> 00:24:59,255
I'm renting them.

576
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:00,554
They're Tony the gardener's kids,

577
00:25:00,589 --> 00:25:02,600
and let's just say I made
a very generous donation

578
00:25:02,641 --> 00:25:03,810
to their college fund. Oh!

579
00:25:03,851 --> 00:25:06,687
Don't forget, kids. You get 20 bucks

580
00:25:06,728 --> 00:25:08,273
for every time you call me Mommy.

581
00:25:08,313 --> 00:25:09,357
Okay?

582
00:25:10,027 --> 00:25:11,067
This is never gonna work.

583
00:25:11,109 --> 00:25:12,193
Oh, yeah, it will.

584
00:25:12,234 --> 00:25:13,278
They could totally pass as our kids.

585
00:25:13,319 --> 00:25:14,750
- <i>Our</i> kids?
- Yeah.

586
00:25:14,785 --> 00:25:17,573
I thought I was coming
for moral support, not child support.

587
00:25:17,615 --> 00:25:19,868
You're gonna lie to this woman
just so you can buy her house?

588
00:25:19,908 --> 00:25:21,494
Well, only until escrow closes.

589
00:25:21,535 --> 00:25:24,371
- I'm not gonna be a part of this.
- Liam, please.

590
00:25:24,414 --> 00:25:26,123
You know how much getting
this house means to me.

591
00:25:26,165 --> 00:25:27,457
I just hate lying.

592
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:29,252
And you won't have to, okay? I promise.

593
00:25:29,293 --> 00:25:31,879
Mrs. Winslow will just assume
that you're the father.

594
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:34,048
And I, of course,
am the very loving mother.

595
00:25:34,090 --> 00:25:35,632
- Mommy!
- Save it.

596
00:25:35,675 --> 00:25:37,092
I told you, it only counts

597
00:25:37,135 --> 00:25:39,303
when you're in front of the old woman.

598
00:25:43,399 --> 00:25:45,560
- Hey.
- Hey.

599
00:25:45,601 --> 00:25:46,727
You find Nadia?

600
00:25:47,234 --> 00:25:49,544
Not yet. I'm sure she'll be here soon.

601
00:25:49,579 --> 00:25:51,379
What about you? Did you send an invite

602
00:25:51,414 --> 00:25:52,419
or receive one?

603
00:25:52,442 --> 00:25:55,219
Sent, but he didn't show up.

604
00:25:55,277 --> 00:25:56,905
Well, he's an idiot.

605
00:25:56,946 --> 00:25:59,197
And it's still early.

606
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,657
True.

607
00:26:02,659 --> 00:26:03,869
Do you want to dance?

608
00:26:03,911 --> 00:26:05,580
While you're waiting for Nadia?

609
00:26:05,621 --> 00:26:07,790
Sure. Yeah, let's do it.

610
00:26:15,465 --> 00:26:16,476
Yeah... okay.

611
00:26:18,801 --> 00:26:19,927
Oh, I see,

612
00:26:19,968 --> 00:26:21,428
you like to lead.

613
00:26:21,471 --> 00:26:24,014
Well, I sort of have two left feet.

614
00:26:24,057 --> 00:26:26,434
But on the plus side,
that means I'm really good

615
00:26:26,475 --> 00:26:29,227
- at dancing in circles.
- Right.

616
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:30,897
Hey, what's that?

617
00:26:32,655 --> 00:26:33,820
Oh.

618
00:26:34,364 --> 00:26:37,110
You take a heart and put it on
when you've met your admirer.

619
00:26:37,152 --> 00:26:38,696
♪ Overgrown ♪

620
00:26:39,696 --> 00:26:43,033
♪ Scales lack luster ♪

621
00:26:43,076 --> 00:26:45,869
♪ A howl's all I can muster... ♪

622
00:26:47,955 --> 00:26:50,625
Might as well.

623
00:26:50,667 --> 00:26:53,086
Soon as Nadia arrives,
my heart will be spoken for.

624
00:26:53,127 --> 00:26:55,629
Look, Adam, I should tell you...

625
00:26:55,672 --> 00:26:56,798
Hey, I'm gonna go check the lobby.

626
00:26:56,839 --> 00:26:57,840
She might be in there.

627
00:26:57,881 --> 00:26:59,341
Will you excuse me for a moment?

628
00:26:59,384 --> 00:27:00,885
I'll, I'll be right back.

629
00:27:05,247 --> 00:27:07,766
- Hey there.
- Vanessa, what are you...?

630
00:27:11,632 --> 00:27:12,938
I've been missing you.

631
00:27:13,774 --> 00:27:14,815
Really?

632
00:27:14,857 --> 00:27:16,900
- You sound so surprised.
- No, it's just

633
00:27:16,943 --> 00:27:20,076
that when you stopped
responding to my texts, I...

634
00:27:20,111 --> 00:27:22,407
Me? You stopped
answering my text messages.

635
00:27:22,447 --> 00:27:23,782
So I thought you were upset.

636
00:27:23,824 --> 00:27:26,159
Which you had every right to be.

637
00:27:26,202 --> 00:27:27,494
But it doesn't matter now.

638
00:27:27,536 --> 00:27:29,955
- Because I'm moving back.
- To Atlanta?

639
00:27:29,997 --> 00:27:31,832
- Mm-hmm.
- What about New York?

640
00:27:31,873 --> 00:27:33,959
You-you found a place,
you're booking gigs...

641
00:27:34,002 --> 00:27:36,169
Who told you that?

642
00:27:36,212 --> 00:27:40,841
It must have been Jeff
when he talked to Monica.

643
00:27:40,882 --> 00:27:43,136
But it sounds like your music career

644
00:27:43,176 --> 00:27:45,138
- has really taken off.
- It is.

645
00:27:45,178 --> 00:27:47,764
But I realized I can
pursue my music here

646
00:27:47,807 --> 00:27:50,114
just as easily as I can in New York.

647
00:27:50,149 --> 00:27:53,061
What I couldn't pursue is you.

648
00:27:55,982 --> 00:27:57,692
I've missed you, too.

649
00:27:58,675 --> 00:28:00,695
Is there any chance we can pick up

650
00:28:00,736 --> 00:28:01,779
where we left off?

651
00:28:01,821 --> 00:28:04,657
Yeah. I'd like that.

652
00:28:13,122 --> 00:28:15,251
Make mine extra dirty, please.

653
00:28:15,292 --> 00:28:16,711
Yeah, yeah, olive juice

654
00:28:16,753 --> 00:28:18,128
with a splash of vodka.

655
00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:19,213
I got you.

656
00:28:19,254 --> 00:28:21,299
This just came for you, Mrs. Colby.

657
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:23,051
Thank you.

658
00:28:23,091 --> 00:28:24,385
Well, who's that from?

659
00:28:24,426 --> 00:28:26,678
Well, it's on Carrington stationery.

660
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:29,724
It's from Blake.

661
00:28:29,765 --> 00:28:31,809
Inviting us to dinner,

662
00:28:31,850 --> 00:28:34,978
suggesting that we celebrate together.

663
00:28:35,021 --> 00:28:37,231
Do you have any idea
what he's talking about?

664
00:28:41,234 --> 00:28:42,527
It's my lawyer.

665
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:43,862
Hello.

666
00:28:44,892 --> 00:28:46,198
Wait, what?

667
00:28:47,532 --> 00:28:49,577
That bastard.

668
00:28:52,539 --> 00:28:54,039
_

669
00:28:58,252 --> 00:28:59,920
Adam?

670
00:28:59,962 --> 00:29:01,089
What are you doing here?

671
00:29:01,129 --> 00:29:02,340
I was invited.

672
00:29:03,222 --> 00:29:04,675
That girl never listens.

673
00:29:04,716 --> 00:29:06,551
- Excuse me?
- Look,

674
00:29:06,593 --> 00:29:08,262
I don't know what Kirby sees in you.

675
00:29:08,303 --> 00:29:09,930
The rest of us see some sort of

676
00:29:09,972 --> 00:29:11,224
"Christian Bale, American Psycho,

677
00:29:11,264 --> 00:29:13,517
only weirder" thing.

678
00:29:13,559 --> 00:29:16,103
All right? But you better not hurt her.

679
00:29:16,145 --> 00:29:18,272
Kirby?
What-what are you talking about? I...

680
00:29:18,313 --> 00:29:20,899
Hey! Was she out here?

681
00:29:23,569 --> 00:29:26,446
No... but she wouldn't be, would she?

682
00:29:26,488 --> 00:29:29,617
Because <i>you</i> sent me the invitation.

683
00:29:29,658 --> 00:29:32,244
I'm gonna...

684
00:29:32,285 --> 00:29:34,871
Um, Happy Valentine's.

685
00:29:34,914 --> 00:29:36,623
I can explain?

686
00:29:36,666 --> 00:29:37,713
Is this some kind of sick joke?

687
00:29:37,748 --> 00:29:39,543
Are you working with
Nadia to set me up again?

688
00:29:39,584 --> 00:29:41,087
What? No, I would never do that.

689
00:29:41,128 --> 00:29:43,380
Then, then why?
Wh-Why, why would you do this?

690
00:29:43,422 --> 00:29:45,382
Because I like you, okay?

691
00:29:45,424 --> 00:29:47,135
You have a funny way
of showing it, all right?

692
00:29:47,176 --> 00:29:49,219
You could have told me
that you sent me the invite

693
00:29:49,262 --> 00:29:50,972
when you first got here. Why didn't you?

694
00:29:51,013 --> 00:29:52,389
Because clearly I was the farthest thing

695
00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:53,850
from your mind,
and I was too embarrassed

696
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:54,975
to tell you the truth.

697
00:29:55,016 --> 00:29:56,310
So you chose to lie to me instead?

698
00:29:56,351 --> 00:29:58,353
All night long.

699
00:29:58,396 --> 00:30:00,564
You made a fool of me,
searching for someone

700
00:30:00,606 --> 00:30:02,158
who is never showing up.

701
00:30:03,984 --> 00:30:06,904
If that's you liking me,
I'd, I'd rather you didn't.

702
00:30:10,032 --> 00:30:12,827
You have such a lovely home, Esther.

703
00:30:12,869 --> 00:30:15,651
And you have a lovely family, dear.

704
00:30:15,686 --> 00:30:17,747
Your children are adorable.

705
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:19,833
Oh, Mommy's perfect little angels.

706
00:30:19,876 --> 00:30:21,293
I love you, Mommy.

707
00:30:21,334 --> 00:30:22,535
Aw.

708
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:25,505
It warms my heart to know that
these walls could be filled

709
00:30:25,548 --> 00:30:27,632
with such a loving family.

710
00:30:27,675 --> 00:30:29,635
Well, let me heat up my tea,

711
00:30:29,676 --> 00:30:31,512
and I'll show you the rest of the house.

712
00:30:31,553 --> 00:30:33,347
Okay, Esther.

713
00:30:35,308 --> 00:30:37,601
Did you hear that? Did you hear that?

714
00:30:37,642 --> 00:30:41,022
Esther loves my family.
This place is mine.

715
00:30:41,062 --> 00:30:44,734
- Great. Can we wrap this up, please?
- Yeah, relax, relax.

716
00:30:44,774 --> 00:30:48,070
I know you hate lying,
but think of it less as lying

717
00:30:48,111 --> 00:30:50,990
and more as a sneak
peek into your future.

718
00:30:51,032 --> 00:30:53,242
This is exactly how
I always imagined it:

719
00:30:53,283 --> 00:30:56,913
a beautiful home, husband, children...

720
00:30:56,954 --> 00:30:59,497
- Excuse me?
- Well, no, I mean, not these children, obviously.

721
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:01,208
The younger one has an overbite.

722
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:02,877
Did you forget that this
whole family charade thing

723
00:31:02,918 --> 00:31:04,669
was just so you could get the house?

724
00:31:04,712 --> 00:31:06,046
It was supposed to be a means to an end,

725
00:31:06,088 --> 00:31:07,715
- not the end itself.
- I'm sorry,

726
00:31:07,756 --> 00:31:10,051
is there something wrong
with this being our future?

727
00:31:10,091 --> 00:31:11,886
This was supposed to be a
quick stop on your journey,

728
00:31:11,927 --> 00:31:13,557
not the final destination.

729
00:31:13,592 --> 00:31:17,225
But if-if you had bothered to
even talk to me for one second,

730
00:31:17,265 --> 00:31:19,017
you would know that
this isn't what I want!

731
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:21,728
Oh, really? Well, exactly what part

732
00:31:21,771 --> 00:31:23,188
of my future don't you like?

733
00:31:23,231 --> 00:31:26,192
Your future has kids. Mine doesn't!

734
00:31:28,026 --> 00:31:29,153
Bye-bye.

735
00:31:30,321 --> 00:31:31,488
I'm sorry.

736
00:31:31,530 --> 00:31:32,657
It was an accident.

737
00:31:32,697 --> 00:31:33,907
He was wearing a heart on his shirt.

738
00:31:33,949 --> 00:31:35,868
I thought you two had
already matched up.

739
00:31:35,909 --> 00:31:37,786
No, he thought Nadia invited him.

740
00:31:37,828 --> 00:31:38,995
The cuckoo nurse that

741
00:31:39,038 --> 00:31:41,081
- Fallon was paying to like him?
- Yes.

742
00:31:41,122 --> 00:31:42,582
Look, I'm sorry
for how it all went down,

743
00:31:42,625 --> 00:31:44,167
but I'm not sorry it ended, okay?

744
00:31:44,209 --> 00:31:46,587
I told you,
dating him is a huge mistake.

745
00:31:46,628 --> 00:31:47,838
I'm a grown woman.

746
00:31:47,879 --> 00:31:49,924
Let me make my own mistakes.

747
00:31:49,965 --> 00:31:52,676
- I did... you joined a cult, remember?
- It wasn't a cult!

748
00:31:52,717 --> 00:31:53,927
I don't want you to get hurt.

749
00:31:53,969 --> 00:31:55,096
What makes you think I'm gonna get hurt?

750
00:31:55,137 --> 00:31:57,305
Because I got hurt!

751
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:01,394
Fletcher is married.

752
00:32:01,435 --> 00:32:04,062
He was lying to me the
whole time we dated.

753
00:32:04,105 --> 00:32:06,398
I ignored the warning signs,
and I don't want you

754
00:32:06,439 --> 00:32:08,525
to make the same mistake.

755
00:32:13,113 --> 00:32:15,157
I'm sorry Fletcher hurt you.

756
00:32:18,828 --> 00:32:20,745
But that doesn't mean
that Adam's gonna hurt me.

757
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:23,707
- Kirby...
- I'm following my heart.

758
00:32:23,748 --> 00:32:25,126
I don't know where it's taking me,

759
00:32:25,167 --> 00:32:27,878
but it feels like the right way to go.

00:32:40,515 --> 00:32:42,517
Oh, this all looks delicious.

766
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:45,488
Mrs. Gunnerson has
outdone herself again.

767
00:32:46,897 --> 00:32:49,108
Sounds like we have company.

768
00:32:49,149 --> 00:32:52,152
Oh, good. You got my invitation.

769
00:32:52,194 --> 00:32:53,654
I was worried that you wouldn't show.

770
00:32:53,696 --> 00:32:54,992
You son of a bitch.

771
00:32:55,027 --> 00:32:56,782
You getting in the
pharmaceutical business now?

772
00:32:56,823 --> 00:32:59,159
- Heard you bought Chlorcyte.
- You heard correctly.

773
00:32:59,201 --> 00:33:01,870
You know damn well Jeff
was buying that company.

774
00:33:01,911 --> 00:33:03,664
You have no reason to outbid him for it.

775
00:33:03,705 --> 00:33:05,373
No, no, I have every reason.

776
00:33:05,416 --> 00:33:09,337
You see, I figured out that your
second-rate husband is sick.

777
00:33:09,378 --> 00:33:11,771
Uh, neurotoxicity, is it?

778
00:33:11,806 --> 00:33:14,675
And oddly enough,
Chlorcyte is researching

779
00:33:14,716 --> 00:33:16,801
a drug to cure just that.

780
00:33:16,843 --> 00:33:19,513
Research that I have put a halt to.

781
00:33:20,328 --> 00:33:22,515
- What do you want?
- Well, please join me.

782
00:33:22,558 --> 00:33:25,186
I'm sure that we could
reach some sort of deal.

783
00:33:25,226 --> 00:33:28,063
Like, say, I give you Chlorcyte

784
00:33:28,105 --> 00:33:29,482
in exchange for C.A.

785
00:33:30,899 --> 00:33:32,859
Yeah, it belongs to me.

786
00:33:32,901 --> 00:33:34,110
And I want it back.

787
00:33:34,152 --> 00:33:35,279
We don't even own it yet.

788
00:33:35,321 --> 00:33:36,380
Yeah, but you will.

789
00:33:36,421 --> 00:33:39,532
So, do we have a deal?

790
00:33:39,574 --> 00:33:40,784
Not interested.

791
00:33:42,887 --> 00:33:46,206
Well, I'm guessing that you will
change your mind soon enough.

792
00:33:46,247 --> 00:33:49,084
I mean, how bad are the symptoms anyway?

793
00:33:49,126 --> 00:33:50,961
You look a little shaky.

794
00:33:51,881 --> 00:33:54,381
You think this is over?

795
00:33:54,423 --> 00:33:57,385
See, there are plenty of other
pharma companies I can buy.

796
00:33:57,426 --> 00:33:59,469
But there's only one C.A.

797
00:33:59,512 --> 00:34:00,763
And it will be mine.

798
00:34:00,804 --> 00:34:02,848
We'll see.

799
00:34:07,201 --> 00:34:09,730
Here we are.
A little treat for everyone.

800
00:34:10,598 --> 00:34:12,690
Do you like freshly baked cookies?

801
00:34:12,732 --> 00:34:15,402
Well, I think we do,
but one should never assume.

802
00:34:15,444 --> 00:34:17,737
Do we like cookies, honey?

803
00:34:17,779 --> 00:34:20,116
As a matter of fact,
I do like a good cookie.

804
00:34:20,156 --> 00:34:23,118
- Yes, thank you for asking!
- Wow.

805
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:24,578
Is everything okay?

806
00:34:24,619 --> 00:34:26,871
Oh, everything is just fine, Esther.

807
00:34:26,913 --> 00:34:28,748
I just, I recently found out that

808
00:34:28,790 --> 00:34:31,918
my husband doesn't want... trees

809
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,587
nearby.

810
00:34:33,628 --> 00:34:36,132
I wasn't aware that my wife
wanted trees in her life.

811
00:34:36,172 --> 00:34:39,092
You see,
they do take a lot of time and care.

812
00:34:39,134 --> 00:34:43,008
Okay, I am more than capable
of taking care of a tree.

813
00:34:43,043 --> 00:34:44,095
Thank you very much.

814
00:34:44,130 --> 00:34:46,016
I mean, I might need a little
help from a few gardeners.

815
00:34:46,058 --> 00:34:48,101
Maybe even a night gardener.

816
00:34:48,143 --> 00:34:49,561
I have an excellent gardener,

817
00:34:49,603 --> 00:34:52,063
but I don't think he works at night.

818
00:34:52,105 --> 00:34:53,607
Well, see, the problem really
isn't the trees, Esther.

819
00:34:53,648 --> 00:34:56,985
It's more of the assumption
that we both wanted trees.

820
00:34:57,027 --> 00:34:58,279
Why wouldn't I want trees?

821
00:34:58,319 --> 00:35:00,947
Everybody wants trees!

822
00:35:00,989 --> 00:35:02,741
Can we go now?
I want to go play <i>Rocket League!</i>

823
00:35:02,782 --> 00:35:05,661
Yeah, and I want my money
for calling you "Mommy."

824
00:35:07,344 --> 00:35:08,500
What?

825
00:35:08,535 --> 00:35:12,293
She's so funny.
Sweetie, I don't have any money for you.

826
00:35:12,333 --> 00:35:13,793
My daddy says you're rich.

827
00:35:13,835 --> 00:35:14,962
Her daddy?

828
00:35:15,003 --> 00:35:17,146
Isn't Liam their father?

829
00:35:17,181 --> 00:35:20,134
- Uh...
- Um... stepfather.

830
00:35:20,176 --> 00:35:22,719
- You're divorced?
- My first husband died.

831
00:35:23,851 --> 00:35:24,904
In the war.

832
00:35:25,245 --> 00:35:26,318
I want to go home.

833
00:35:26,353 --> 00:35:27,808
- Yeah, can we go? I want to get paid.
- I want to leave!

834
00:35:27,850 --> 00:35:30,060
Okay, all right! It's bedtime, kids.

835
00:35:30,101 --> 00:35:32,480
Why don't you go to the car,
and Daddy and I'll meet you there?

836
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,647
Right, send the kids outside alone

837
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:36,650
in the dark... mother of the year.

838
00:35:36,692 --> 00:35:38,110
You know what? I think I've had

839
00:35:38,152 --> 00:35:40,069
about enough of Daddy's snide comments.

840
00:35:40,112 --> 00:35:41,304
- Oh, you've had enough?
- Yeah.

841
00:35:41,339 --> 00:35:43,324
I didn't want to be dragged into
this in the first place, Fallon.

842
00:35:43,656 --> 00:35:45,116
I told you I hate lying...

843
00:35:45,159 --> 00:35:45,826
Would you mind explaining to me...?

844
00:35:45,868 --> 00:35:48,286
- I hate you, I want my real mommy...
- Can we just go?

845
00:35:48,328 --> 00:35:49,538
I don't want to do this, Fallon.

846
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:50,873
Everybody, shut up!

847
00:35:56,463 --> 00:35:57,755
I think we're done here.

848
00:35:57,795 --> 00:36:00,215
Yeah. Hey, kids, let's go.

849
00:36:04,552 --> 00:36:06,179
So, you were saying this house

850
00:36:06,221 --> 00:36:09,600
gets a lot of south-facing light?

851
00:36:09,641 --> 00:36:13,145
Get the hell out of my house,
you crazy bitch.

852
00:36:19,518 --> 00:36:20,944
Michael, what's wrong?

853
00:36:20,985 --> 00:36:22,196
Vanessa's back in town.

854
00:36:22,643 --> 00:36:24,864
- To stay.
- What? Since when?

855
00:36:24,906 --> 00:36:26,534
Since today.

856
00:36:26,574 --> 00:36:28,159
She wants to start dating again.

857
00:36:28,201 --> 00:36:30,411
Which is great.

858
00:36:30,453 --> 00:36:32,038
But if she ever found out about us,

859
00:36:32,081 --> 00:36:34,875
- about what we did...
- Michael, relax.

860
00:36:35,905 --> 00:36:37,502
Last night can be our little secret.

861
00:36:37,545 --> 00:36:39,505
A drunken moment of weakness

862
00:36:39,547 --> 00:36:40,630
on both our parts.

863
00:36:41,155 --> 00:36:42,174
That's all.

864
00:36:42,221 --> 00:36:43,592
So, this stays between us?

865
00:36:43,634 --> 00:36:45,177
Of course.

866
00:36:45,219 --> 00:36:49,889
I want you and Vanessa
to be happy... truly.

867
00:36:49,931 --> 00:36:51,558
Thank you.

868
00:37:01,442 --> 00:37:04,572
Hi, sweetheart, it's Mom.

869
00:37:04,612 --> 00:37:07,574
Did you get back to Atlanta safely?

870
00:37:07,616 --> 00:37:09,326
Good.

871
00:37:09,368 --> 00:37:11,328
Get some rest.

872
00:37:11,369 --> 00:37:14,123
We'll talk tomorrow.

873
00:37:25,463 --> 00:37:26,552
Hi.

874
00:37:27,277 --> 00:37:28,721
Look, I'm really sorry.

875
00:37:28,761 --> 00:37:31,848
I should have been honest with
my feelings from the start.

876
00:37:31,889 --> 00:37:34,268
You have every reason to be mad at me.

877
00:37:34,310 --> 00:37:36,353
I'm not mad at you, Kirby.

878
00:37:38,147 --> 00:37:40,190
I'm mad at myself.

879
00:37:40,232 --> 00:37:42,192
For not letting go of Nadia.

880
00:37:42,234 --> 00:37:43,569
I gave her my trust.

881
00:37:43,610 --> 00:37:45,654
And she destroyed that trust.

882
00:37:47,614 --> 00:37:50,366
I mean, she just got away with it.

883
00:37:51,319 --> 00:37:53,411
She never had to pay for all those lies.

884
00:38:20,355 --> 00:38:22,607
Wait, wait, wait.

885
00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:23,942
Is this a bad idea?

886
00:38:23,984 --> 00:38:26,904
I'm in the mood for a bad idea.

887
00:38:32,534 --> 00:38:34,578
Didn't expect to find you here.

888
00:38:35,788 --> 00:38:39,083
Certainly not after my
epic mommy meltdown.

889
00:38:40,208 --> 00:38:43,337
Yeah, I sort of surprised myself.

890
00:38:43,378 --> 00:38:45,505
Fallon, I had to find out what...

891
00:38:47,408 --> 00:38:49,342
What brought all this on?

892
00:38:49,384 --> 00:38:52,679
I mean, your mind was suddenly
15 years down the road.

893
00:38:53,711 --> 00:38:55,431
Moving out of the manor.

894
00:38:55,473 --> 00:38:58,226
I think it made me
reexamine my life and...

895
00:38:58,268 --> 00:39:01,938
made me think about what I
wanted my life to be, and...

896
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:03,357
I thought it was about the house,

897
00:39:03,398 --> 00:39:05,692
but... it wasn't.

898
00:39:05,734 --> 00:39:07,777
It was more about

899
00:39:07,819 --> 00:39:09,154
what the house represented.

900
00:39:09,196 --> 00:39:11,447
And I decided I liked that future.

901
00:39:11,489 --> 00:39:13,701
Well, Fallon, that's the problem.

902
00:39:13,741 --> 00:39:15,118
You.

903
00:39:15,159 --> 00:39:16,786
<i>You</i> decided.

904
00:39:18,330 --> 00:39:20,456
You make all the decisions in our life.

905
00:39:21,889 --> 00:39:24,168
When we go to dinner, where we vacation,

906
00:39:24,210 --> 00:39:26,045
whose place we stay at, and...
you know, look,

907
00:39:26,087 --> 00:39:27,755
most of the time I don't really care.

908
00:39:27,797 --> 00:39:29,674
But on the big things, I do.

909
00:39:29,717 --> 00:39:31,384
And there's never a compromise.

910
00:39:31,427 --> 00:39:33,469
- That's not true.
- Really?

911
00:39:33,511 --> 00:39:36,431
Fallon, we went from dating
to married with children,

912
00:39:36,473 --> 00:39:38,600
and I didn't even know about it.

913
00:39:39,810 --> 00:39:41,853
Well...

914
00:39:43,063 --> 00:39:46,612
I didn't realize how serious you were
about this whole "no kids" thing.

915
00:39:46,647 --> 00:39:47,711
It's just...

916
00:39:47,746 --> 00:39:50,737
we both come from pretty
messed-up families.

917
00:39:50,779 --> 00:39:53,866
I guess I was just kind of
hoping to break the cycle.

918
00:39:53,906 --> 00:39:55,074
Yeah, well, me, too.

919
00:39:55,116 --> 00:39:56,743
Just the other way around.

920
00:39:56,784 --> 00:39:58,279
I've always wanted kids,

921
00:39:58,314 --> 00:39:59,996
and I think that you
and I could do it right.

922
00:40:00,675 --> 00:40:04,460
But if it's a choice
between you and children,

923
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:07,295
I mean... Liam, I choose you.

924
00:40:07,337 --> 00:40:08,464
You really mean that?

925
00:40:08,505 --> 00:40:09,757
Yeah.

926
00:40:09,797 --> 00:40:12,676
You see, I'm all about compromise.

927
00:40:12,717 --> 00:40:14,761
Come here.

928
00:40:21,476 --> 00:40:22,728
Tell you what.

929
00:40:22,770 --> 00:40:24,520
Hmm?

930
00:40:24,563 --> 00:40:26,482
Why don't we see where life takes us?

931
00:40:26,522 --> 00:40:27,982
Hmm.

932
00:40:28,025 --> 00:40:29,567
All right, maybe we'll want children.

933
00:40:30,633 --> 00:40:32,112
Who knows? Maybe we won't.

934
00:40:33,101 --> 00:40:34,947
But we'll decide on it together.

935
00:40:34,989 --> 00:40:38,451
And I will suspend the house search

936
00:40:38,493 --> 00:40:40,788
until we're both ready to look for one.

937
00:40:40,828 --> 00:40:42,538
Okay.

938
00:40:42,581 --> 00:40:45,292
But I'm not backing down on
the 15-bedroom thing because...

939
00:40:45,333 --> 00:40:46,375
Yeah, yeah, sure, sure.

940
00:40:56,383 --> 00:40:58,263
Cristal! You're home!

941
00:40:58,304 --> 00:41:00,556
I took a late flight and
thought I'd surprise you.

942
00:41:00,598 --> 00:41:02,141
Oh, it worked.

943
00:41:02,183 --> 00:41:04,101
It has been so lonely here without you.

944
00:41:04,143 --> 00:41:05,353
Oh.

945
00:41:06,647 --> 00:41:07,815
I'm happy to be back.

946
00:41:07,855 --> 00:41:09,482
Well, I hope you spent some quality time

947
00:41:09,525 --> 00:41:11,652
- with your family in Mexico.
- Yes.

948
00:41:11,692 --> 00:41:13,402
I got exactly what I needed.

949
00:41:14,084 --> 00:41:15,781
So, what's the latest around here?

950
00:41:15,822 --> 00:41:17,491
Are you back at the helm of C.A.?

951
00:41:17,532 --> 00:41:19,909
Let's just say I'm still working on it.

952
00:41:19,951 --> 00:41:22,453
Which reminds me, there...

953
00:41:22,496 --> 00:41:24,956
is something I need
to talk to you about.

954
00:41:28,085 --> 00:41:30,087
You can take that right upstairs.

955
00:41:30,127 --> 00:41:31,337
Dominique?

956
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:33,382
What the hell are you doing here?

957
00:41:33,422 --> 00:41:34,842
Didn't Blake tell you?

958
00:41:34,882 --> 00:41:36,509
I'm moving in, dear.

959
00:41:36,552 --> 00:41:39,304
Yeah, that's the something
I need to talk to you about.
