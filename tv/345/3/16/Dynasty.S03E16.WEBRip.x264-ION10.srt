that's not likely.

Although your name's on
the birth certificate,

you signed away your

Connor was even born.

178
00:06:18,943 --> 00:06:20,510
FALLON:Heidi basically hid Connor's

179
00:06:20,554 --> 00:06:22,556
existence from Liamfor over a decade,

180
00:06:22,599 --> 00:06:24,993
and then showed up here,dumped him on our doorstep

181
00:06:25,036 --> 00:06:26,255
and took offwithout a trace.

182
00:06:26,298 --> 00:06:28,344
Well, she's no mother
of the year, true.

183
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,346
And I'm pretty sureshe's still lying to us

184
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,478
about where shedisappeared to.

185
00:06:31,521 --> 00:06:33,001
ANDERS:Well, that's something we could

186
00:06:33,044 --> 00:06:34,350
probably find out.Yes, but what if she was

187
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:36,570
off on a drug binge?Or at a furry convention?

188
00:06:36,613 --> 00:06:39,137
She's probably alreadypsychologically damaged Connor.

189
00:06:39,181 --> 00:06:41,488
Look, family court only cares
about one thing:

190
00:06:41,531 --> 00:06:43,359
whether a parent is fit
to raise a kid.

191
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:45,143
Alexis had a closet
full of skeletons;

192
00:06:45,187 --> 00:06:47,363
it was easy to prove that
she was an unfit mother.

193
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:49,931
So we just have to findHeidi's skeletons

194
00:06:49,974 --> 00:06:51,280
and throw them at a judge.

195
00:06:51,323 --> 00:06:53,804
Where do we start?

196
00:06:53,848 --> 00:06:57,286
This is where I make
an excuse and leave.

197
00:06:58,374 --> 00:07:01,595
Look, I'm thrilled
that you came to me,

198
00:07:01,638 --> 00:07:04,424
but I made a promise to Cristaland myself

199
00:07:04,467 --> 00:07:05,903
to be a better person.

200
00:07:05,947 --> 00:07:07,209
And helping you with thisdoes not fit into that.

201
00:07:07,252 --> 00:07:09,385
Unbelievable.

202
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,779
The one time I actually want you

203
00:07:11,822 --> 00:07:14,129
to be your true self,
you refuse?

204
00:07:14,172 --> 00:07:15,347
If you want to be

205
00:07:15,391 --> 00:07:16,784
a better person,
maybe you should start

206
00:07:16,827 --> 00:07:19,047
by repairing your relationship
with your daughter.

207
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:22,442
No? Hmm.

208
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:25,009
You take her social media.

209
00:07:26,271 --> 00:07:27,577
I'll make some phone calls.

210
00:07:29,361 --> 00:07:33,148
WOMAN [over P.A.]:
Nutrition, dial 1454.

211
00:07:34,192 --> 00:07:36,804
JENNINGS:
Ugh.

212
00:07:36,847 --> 00:07:38,501
[exhales]

213
00:07:38,545 --> 00:07:39,937
Usually when people groan
like that around here,

214
00:07:39,981 --> 00:07:41,983
it's becausethey're learning to walk again.

215
00:07:43,637 --> 00:07:45,029
You okay?

216
00:07:45,073 --> 00:07:47,467
Apparently, I'm the only person
who values my time.

217
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:50,905
I'm being stood up by
two men simultaneously.

218
00:07:50,948 --> 00:07:52,559
Not smart men, obviously.

219
00:07:52,602 --> 00:07:55,083
You know, maybe you couldtake it as a sign.

220
00:07:55,126 --> 00:07:56,693
Instead of cursingwhat you can't control,

221
00:07:56,737 --> 00:07:59,696
maybe just appreciatewhat's already in front of you.

222
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:02,656
You mean the sweaty stranger who
doesn't understand boundaries?

223
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:05,136
Maybe not. [chuckles]

224
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:07,487
But I do appreciate the value
of your time.

225
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:09,880
So if I were to offer youa sympathetic ear,

226
00:08:09,924 --> 00:08:11,665
maybe I could get a discount?

227
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:14,232
Cute. But do I look like
I offer discounts?

228
00:08:14,276 --> 00:08:15,886
Hmm.And I'm not sure

229
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:17,018
how helpful you'd be, so...

230
00:08:17,061 --> 00:08:18,889
You'd be surprised.

231
00:08:18,933 --> 00:08:22,110
By the advice of a gym rat
on his lunch break?

232
00:08:22,153 --> 00:08:24,155
Mm-hmm.I'm good.

233
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:26,506
WOMAN [over P.A.]:
Ophthalmology attending, OR 1.

234
00:08:26,549 --> 00:08:28,029
FALLON:
I just spent the last hour

235
00:08:28,072 --> 00:08:30,031
deep diving into Heidi's
social media

236
00:08:30,074 --> 00:08:32,860
and so far, the only
skeleton I found is her

237
00:08:32,903 --> 00:08:35,036
unfortunate belief that she
can pull off stretch velvet.

238
00:08:35,079 --> 00:08:37,429
Well, is it possible
she's just a good person

239
00:08:37,473 --> 00:08:38,605
who made a bad decision?

240
00:08:38,648 --> 00:08:40,781
Absolutely not.

241
00:08:40,824 --> 00:08:42,391
Oh, anything?

242
00:08:42,434 --> 00:08:44,698
Well, I was able to find
the address where Heidi stayed

243
00:08:44,741 --> 00:08:45,829
during her disappearance.

244
00:08:45,873 --> 00:08:48,049
I gather it's a
privately owned

245
00:08:48,092 --> 00:08:49,703
farm in the
Arizona mountains,

246
00:08:49,746 --> 00:08:51,487
just a stone's throw
from the Mexico border.

247
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:54,055
She told me she was staying
with a friend.

248
00:08:54,098 --> 00:08:56,187
Apparently a friend who has
an application pending

249
00:08:56,231 --> 00:08:58,320
to grow and distribute
medical marijuana.

250
00:08:58,363 --> 00:09:02,759
Oh-ho-ho.
That lying little pothead.

251
00:09:02,803 --> 00:09:04,369
Anders, I'd hug you right now,

252
00:09:04,413 --> 00:09:06,589
but neither of us
really wants that.

253
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:10,158
Up for a day trip?

254
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:13,727
ADAM:
Excuse me, Nurse?

255
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:16,599
Would you pull up
Jeff Colby's charts?

256
00:09:16,643 --> 00:09:18,775
I'd like to order acouple more panels.

257
00:09:18,819 --> 00:09:20,690
Dr. Khan was pretty thorough.

258
00:09:20,734 --> 00:09:21,996
He ordered the works.

259
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:23,258
Yeah, I'd like totake a second look.

260
00:09:23,301 --> 00:09:25,303
He's family, you know.

261
00:09:25,347 --> 00:09:26,609
Of course.

262
00:09:26,653 --> 00:09:28,176
WOMAN [over P.A.]:
Dr. Messina, you're needed

263
00:09:28,219 --> 00:09:29,307
in OR 2, stat.

264
00:09:29,351 --> 00:09:31,396
All right.

265
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,051
Did Dr. Khan order a DBS?

266
00:09:34,095 --> 00:09:36,271
Um...[keys clacking]

267
00:09:36,314 --> 00:09:37,533
[quietly]:Here we go.

268
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:40,405
Oh, no.

269
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:43,539
KIRBY
We're going all out
for the all-stars.

270
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,106
I'm thinking an adult-size
ball pit here,

271
00:09:45,149 --> 00:09:46,673
a vodka waterfall in the bar,

272
00:09:46,716 --> 00:09:48,326
and caviar on every table,
of course.

273
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:51,373
That sounds great, but this
is soccer, not the NBA.

274
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:54,202
And this party is being hostedby the Atlantix, not the Lakers.

275
00:09:54,245 --> 00:09:56,639
We have budgetary constraints.Okay.

276
00:09:56,683 --> 00:09:58,554
So we just keep it simple
and sophisticated.

277
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,382
I'm sure we can keep
everyone happy.

278
00:10:00,425 --> 00:10:02,602
Oh, I thinkit sounds great.

279
00:10:02,645 --> 00:10:05,430
Last year, Milwaukeehosted the party in a field...

280
00:10:05,474 --> 00:10:06,649
in March.

281
00:10:06,693 --> 00:10:07,650
[laughter]

282
00:10:07,694 --> 00:10:09,130
We nearly froze to death.

283
00:10:09,173 --> 00:10:12,002
Well, our event space has four
functional fireplaces

284
00:10:12,046 --> 00:10:13,874
to keep you toasty and warm,
so don't worry.

285
00:10:13,917 --> 00:10:16,050
Get off me. Hey, I know
the owner. Get off me!

286
00:10:16,093 --> 00:10:19,531
Well, as you can see, we also
have top-notch security.

287
00:10:19,575 --> 00:10:21,142
Sam!

288
00:10:21,185 --> 00:10:22,883
It's me, Ramy.

289
00:10:24,275 --> 00:10:25,363
I just got youa huge payday.

290
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:26,582
Now you're getting greedy.

291
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:27,757
Get my money by 5:00.

292
00:10:27,801 --> 00:10:29,672
$200,000.It's all here.

293
00:10:29,716 --> 00:10:32,240
Kirby, why don't you

294
00:10:32,283 --> 00:10:34,677
show the commissioner
the, um, VIP lounge?

295
00:10:34,721 --> 00:10:37,114
The V-I...?

296
00:10:37,158 --> 00:10:39,421
Uh, please, come with me,
gentlemen.

297
00:10:39,464 --> 00:10:41,945
[chuckles]

298
00:10:41,989 --> 00:10:43,468
RAMY:Get off me!

299
00:10:43,512 --> 00:10:44,513
He's fine!

300
00:10:44,556 --> 00:10:45,906
I told you I knew the owner.

301
00:10:45,949 --> 00:10:47,472
He's good.

302
00:10:47,516 --> 00:10:49,692
How have you been the
last few years, Sam?

303
00:10:49,736 --> 00:10:53,130
You know, while I was in prisondoing time for yourcrime.

304
00:10:53,174 --> 00:10:55,480
ADAM:
You're suffering from acute

305
00:10:55,524 --> 00:10:57,178
liver failure-- that's what
caused you to pass out.

306
00:10:57,221 --> 00:10:59,093
What?

307
00:10:59,136 --> 00:11:00,834
And no one noticed it until now?

308
00:11:00,877 --> 00:11:02,270
The warning signs were atypical.

309
00:11:02,313 --> 00:11:03,401
If Dr. Carrington

310
00:11:03,445 --> 00:11:05,360
hadn't taken a new
look at your file,

311
00:11:05,403 --> 00:11:06,796
we may not have caught itso soon-- you're lucky.

312
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,276
That's not the word I'd use.

313
00:11:08,319 --> 00:11:09,494
ADAM: Well, the
good news is

314
00:11:09,538 --> 00:11:11,235
if we can find you a donor,

315
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,585
a liver transplant
will save your life.

316
00:11:13,629 --> 00:11:15,849
And the bad news?

317
00:11:15,892 --> 00:11:17,720
You have an incredibly
rare tissue type.

318
00:11:17,764 --> 00:11:19,374
Finding a donor on the
public transplant list

319
00:11:19,417 --> 00:11:21,245
will benext-to-impossible.

320
00:11:21,289 --> 00:11:24,031
But, if we can find a match
from a family member,

321
00:11:24,074 --> 00:11:25,467
we could do
a living transplant.

322
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:27,208
Livers regenerate,

323
00:11:27,251 --> 00:11:28,688
so if someone's a match,
we can take a piece

324
00:11:28,731 --> 00:11:30,167
of theirs
and grow you a new one.

325
00:11:30,211 --> 00:11:32,387
I'd give you a piece
of my liver if I could.

326
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:33,997
I'll leave you
to talk things through.

327
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:36,260
WOMAN [over P.A.]:
Hospital transport

328
00:11:36,304 --> 00:11:37,348
to vascular imaging...

329
00:11:37,392 --> 00:11:40,047
Tell me something, Doctor.

330
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:41,831
Why were you taking
another look at my file?

331
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:43,746
What did you do to me?

332
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:46,183
This has your fingerprintsall over it.I...

333
00:11:46,227 --> 00:11:47,271
[clears throat]

334
00:11:47,315 --> 00:11:48,838
Look, I'm not playing
around here.

335
00:11:52,407 --> 00:11:53,930
He gave you Clompofein.

336
00:11:53,974 --> 00:11:55,192
Mother.

337
00:11:55,236 --> 00:11:56,803
What?! What the hell is that?

338
00:11:56,846 --> 00:11:58,848
It's the experimental cure
Alexis mentioned.

339
00:11:58,892 --> 00:12:01,024
I, I was actually trying
to save your life, Jeff.

340
00:12:01,068 --> 00:12:02,939
By putting me back
in the hospital?

341
00:12:02,983 --> 00:12:04,375
That wasn't part of the plan--
the side effects were

342
00:12:04,419 --> 00:12:06,116
a little worse than expected.

343
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,248
You haveto understand...

344
00:12:07,291 --> 00:12:09,772
No, I don't "have to" anything.

345
00:12:09,816 --> 00:12:12,079
Remember that little
confessional you filmed?

346
00:12:12,122 --> 00:12:14,472
There's a copy of it
at my lawyer's office

347
00:12:14,516 --> 00:12:16,387
with instructions
to give it to the police

348
00:12:16,431 --> 00:12:17,998
if I die unexpectedly.

349
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:21,349
So, unless you want to spendthe rest of your life in prison,

350
00:12:21,392 --> 00:12:23,438
find a way to get me better.

351
00:12:29,923 --> 00:12:31,272
What are you doing here, Ramy?

352
00:12:31,315 --> 00:12:32,795
Where else was I
supposed to go?

353
00:12:32,839 --> 00:12:34,231
I just got released yesterday,

354
00:12:34,275 --> 00:12:35,755
and you're the only person
I know in Georgia.

355
00:12:35,798 --> 00:12:36,799
Well, I'm glad you're out.

356
00:12:36,843 --> 00:12:37,800
What's your plan?

357
00:12:37,844 --> 00:12:39,193
I'm not sure.

358
00:12:39,236 --> 00:12:40,847
I can't go to my brother's
until next week,

359
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:42,413
so I was thinking

360
00:12:42,457 --> 00:12:44,764
maybe I could, uh, crash here

361
00:12:44,807 --> 00:12:46,635
for a minute.

362
00:12:46,678 --> 00:12:48,898
Um, yes. Of course.

363
00:12:48,942 --> 00:12:49,986
Front desk will find

364
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:51,248
you a room--
I'll take care of it.

365
00:12:51,292 --> 00:12:53,250
Thank you.

366
00:12:53,294 --> 00:12:54,991
[quietly]:You're welcome.

367
00:12:58,690 --> 00:12:59,779
Who's the vagrant?

368
00:12:59,822 --> 00:13:01,868
I don't know what that means.

369
00:13:01,911 --> 00:13:03,783
He's my friend, Ramy Crockett.

370
00:13:03,826 --> 00:13:04,914
He's gonna be staying here

371
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:05,872
for a couple of days.

372
00:13:05,915 --> 00:13:07,003
"Ramy"?

373
00:13:07,047 --> 00:13:08,831
As in the guy
who robbed the manor?

374
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:10,790
It's a lot more complicated
than that.

375
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:12,835
Okay, well, I hope it's
not too complicated to keep

376
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:15,098
a convicted felon away
from the millionaire athletes

377
00:13:15,142 --> 00:13:17,187
that are gonna be here
for tomorrow's party.Kirby?

378
00:13:17,231 --> 00:13:19,450
You worry about the party,
I'll worry about Ramy.

379
00:13:20,974 --> 00:13:22,366
ADAM:
I was able to find

380
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:24,847
most of Jeff's relatives already

381
00:13:24,891 --> 00:13:25,935
in the hospital database.

382
00:13:25,979 --> 00:13:28,416
And I ran their DNA
against Jeff's,

383
00:13:28,459 --> 00:13:30,200
even Blake's.And?

384
00:13:30,244 --> 00:13:31,636
The only person

385
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,334
that's a match is...

386
00:13:33,377 --> 00:13:34,814
me.
Really?

387
00:13:34,857 --> 00:13:36,641
Well, that's great news--
we need to tell Jeff.

388
00:13:36,685 --> 00:13:38,905
Except I can't donate.Why not?

389
00:13:38,948 --> 00:13:40,820
When my... adoptive mom

390
00:13:40,863 --> 00:13:43,910
was sick, I gave part
of my liver to save her,

391
00:13:43,953 --> 00:13:45,607
which is whyI recognized

392
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:47,130
the early warning signs in Jeff.

393
00:13:47,174 --> 00:13:48,610
Why can't you donate again?

394
00:13:48,653 --> 00:13:50,699
You said livers
regenerate.

395
00:13:50,742 --> 00:13:52,875
They do, but the chances
of a donor

396
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:56,270
surviving a second transplant
are incredibly low.

397
00:13:57,793 --> 00:13:59,012
It could kill me.

398
00:14:00,056 --> 00:14:01,362
However...

399
00:14:02,929 --> 00:14:04,495
...there's a terminal patient
at the hospital,

400
00:14:04,539 --> 00:14:06,889
who is a potential match.

401
00:14:06,933 --> 00:14:09,500
He's being taken offlife support any day now.

402
00:14:09,544 --> 00:14:11,720
But he's not a registered donor.

403
00:14:11,763 --> 00:14:14,375
You mean he's not
a registered donor...

404
00:14:14,418 --> 00:14:15,855
yet.

405
00:14:18,945 --> 00:14:20,468
[birds chirping]

406
00:14:30,782 --> 00:14:33,089
Hmm, pretty poshfor a pot farm.

407
00:14:33,133 --> 00:14:34,612
"The Cleansing
Moon Ranch."

408
00:14:34,656 --> 00:14:35,918
What is this place?

409
00:14:35,962 --> 00:14:36,919
Maybe it's another cult.

410
00:14:36,963 --> 00:14:38,442
WOMAN:Namaste!

411
00:14:38,486 --> 00:14:41,837
You are just in time
for our sunrise circle.

412
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,752
Did you get your jade kegel
welcome egg?

413
00:14:43,795 --> 00:14:45,580
Uh, no.

414
00:14:45,623 --> 00:14:48,278
But I have a bunch at home
in my fridge, so I'm good.

415
00:14:48,322 --> 00:14:49,889
Okay, well,as I'm sure

416
00:14:49,932 --> 00:14:53,501
you know, this is
an exclusive female-only

417
00:14:53,544 --> 00:14:54,632
wellness retreat.

418
00:14:54,676 --> 00:14:56,460
Um, we were hoping
you could tell us

419
00:14:56,504 --> 00:14:58,941
what kind of wellness
you practice here exactly?

420
00:14:58,985 --> 00:15:01,944
Because we heard rumors
of, um, well, drugs.

421
00:15:01,988 --> 00:15:03,990
Oh, that's our cotenants,
not us.

422
00:15:04,033 --> 00:15:05,208
We useHimalayan salts

423
00:15:05,252 --> 00:15:07,080
to reset hormonal planes,

424
00:15:07,123 --> 00:15:08,995
practice orgasmic meditation...

425
00:15:09,038 --> 00:15:10,910
"Orgasmic"?Meditation.

426
00:15:10,953 --> 00:15:12,389
It's life-changing.

427
00:15:12,433 --> 00:15:14,957
We were actually just hoping
we can get a quick tour.

428
00:15:15,001 --> 00:15:16,089
My friend Heidi was

429
00:15:16,132 --> 00:15:17,873
here recently and
she cannot stop

430
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,831
raving about this place, um...

431
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:21,659
orgasmically.

432
00:15:21,703 --> 00:15:23,052
Huh.

433
00:15:23,096 --> 00:15:24,880
Seemed like she couldn't
get out of here fast enough.

434
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:25,925
Really?

435
00:15:25,968 --> 00:15:27,317
She spent our entire

436
00:15:27,361 --> 00:15:28,971
nut milk foraging trip
searching for a signal,

437
00:15:29,015 --> 00:15:31,713
so she could call her son.

438
00:15:31,756 --> 00:15:33,236
She really just needed
a psychic tune-up.

439
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,238
Yeah.

440
00:15:35,282 --> 00:15:36,805
Well, don't we all?

441
00:15:36,848 --> 00:15:37,937
[door closes]

442
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:40,069
Blake, where are you?

443
00:15:40,113 --> 00:15:41,636
Well, currently,
we're about 20,000 feet

444
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:43,594
over the Texas/Arkansas border.

445
00:15:43,638 --> 00:15:45,074
We'll be home soon.

446
00:15:45,118 --> 00:15:46,597
Look, honey, I told you.

447
00:15:46,641 --> 00:15:48,948
When Fallon came to me for help,I couldn't say no.

448
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:50,427
I understand how important

449
00:15:50,471 --> 00:15:52,038
repairing your relationship
with Fallon is,

450
00:15:52,081 --> 00:15:53,474
but I'm having issues, too.

451
00:15:53,517 --> 00:15:54,997
The church finally e-mailed,

452
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:57,913
asking if I can meet thechaplain at the PT center today.

453
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,393
Great, what's the problem?

454
00:15:59,436 --> 00:16:01,264
You're the one who's got
a relationship with this guy.

455
00:16:01,308 --> 00:16:03,353
Well, you're the one that has
the relationship with God.

456
00:16:03,397 --> 00:16:05,007
If anyone can convince

457
00:16:05,051 --> 00:16:06,443
Father Kelly to sway
the board members,

458
00:16:06,487 --> 00:16:08,097
it's a good Catholic girl
like you.

459
00:16:08,141 --> 00:16:09,925
So you're already
blowing this off?

460
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:13,102
Honey, I promise you, I'm still100% committed to our mission.

461
00:16:13,146 --> 00:16:14,408
Call me when you're
out of your meeting.

462
00:16:14,451 --> 00:16:16,366
I love you.

463
00:16:18,281 --> 00:16:20,196
Trouble in paradise?

464
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,024
No, we're fine.

465
00:16:22,068 --> 00:16:24,200
So, what do you think?

466
00:16:24,244 --> 00:16:25,897
Why didn't Heidijust say

467
00:16:25,941 --> 00:16:28,422
she was at that...
whatever it was?

468
00:16:28,465 --> 00:16:31,555
Well, maybe she was embarrassedby the orgasmic meditation.

469
00:16:31,599 --> 00:16:33,775
Well, I'm sorry
it didn't work out.

470
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:38,345
Your mission, not Heidi's...
you know.

471
00:16:38,388 --> 00:16:40,086
Oh, we're not done.

472
00:16:40,129 --> 00:16:43,306
Fallon, there areno skeletons in Heidi's closet,

473
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:45,743
just jade eggs.Hmm.

474
00:16:45,787 --> 00:16:48,094
And Cristal needs my help
with this clinic.

475
00:16:48,137 --> 00:16:50,531
Great, you two can go
and save the world

476
00:16:50,574 --> 00:16:52,533
all you want after we do this.

477
00:16:52,576 --> 00:16:53,664
Do what?

478
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:55,362
Well, we couldn't
find any skeletons

479
00:16:55,405 --> 00:16:57,581
in Heidi's closet, so...

480
00:16:57,625 --> 00:16:59,366
we're gonna have
to go buy some bones

481
00:16:59,409 --> 00:17:00,845
and build our own.

482
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:09,506
Uh, excuse me?

483
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:10,899
Do you know
Father Kelly?

484
00:17:10,942 --> 00:17:12,074
Uh, of course.

485
00:17:12,118 --> 00:17:13,815
Great, have you
seen him around?

486
00:17:13,858 --> 00:17:15,643
I was supposed to meet
with him ten minutes ago.

487
00:17:15,686 --> 00:17:17,166
I haven't seen him
around lately.

488
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:18,559
He retired last week.

489
00:17:18,602 --> 00:17:21,518
Uh, but the church office
e-mailed me this morning

490
00:17:21,562 --> 00:17:24,086
to confirm my meeting
with the hospital chaplain?

491
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:26,045
Mm-hmm, um...

492
00:17:26,088 --> 00:17:27,176
Oh, then you should
talk with him.

493
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:29,135
That's Father Collins.

494
00:17:29,178 --> 00:17:31,180
Father... Collins.

495
00:17:32,181 --> 00:17:34,575
Thanks.

496
00:17:34,618 --> 00:17:36,838
There's no chance
he's calling you that

497
00:17:36,881 --> 00:17:38,840
because he's your
son, is there?I'm afraid

498
00:17:38,883 --> 00:17:40,624
the only children
I'm responsible for

499
00:17:40,668 --> 00:17:41,756
are the children of God.

500
00:17:41,799 --> 00:17:44,019
You're the new hospital priest?Mm-hmm.

501
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,499
Why didn't you
tell me yesterday?

502
00:17:45,542 --> 00:17:47,414
Before or after
you called me a gym rat

503
00:17:47,457 --> 00:17:48,850
with a lack of boundaries?

504
00:17:48,893 --> 00:17:50,895
I'm sorry

505
00:17:50,939 --> 00:17:52,636
about that.
I'm just a little

506
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,898
anxious about this program

507
00:17:53,942 --> 00:17:55,465
and I was counting
on Father Kelly's help

508
00:17:55,509 --> 00:17:56,771
with the board.Mm.

509
00:17:56,814 --> 00:17:57,946
But...

510
00:17:57,989 --> 00:18:00,122
maybe the two of us
could sit down

511
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:01,428
for a coffee and

512
00:18:01,471 --> 00:18:03,430
discuss a mutually
beneficial arrangement?

513
00:18:03,473 --> 00:18:04,474
My treat?

514
00:18:04,518 --> 00:18:06,172
I'm sorry, I'm really

515
00:18:06,215 --> 00:18:07,347
not that kind of a priest.

516
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:09,436
That kind of a...?Unlike my predecessor,

517
00:18:09,479 --> 00:18:10,567
I really don't think
that the clergy

518
00:18:10,611 --> 00:18:12,134
has any place
in hospital politics.

519
00:18:12,178 --> 00:18:13,657
And that's...

520
00:18:13,701 --> 00:18:17,096
no matter how enticing
the, uh, bribe may be.

521
00:18:17,139 --> 00:18:19,837
I-- No, that's not what I...Don't worry.

522
00:18:19,881 --> 00:18:21,361
From what I've seen,
I have no doubt

523
00:18:21,404 --> 00:18:22,971
that you can hold your own
with those guys.

524
00:18:23,014 --> 00:18:24,059
[chuckles]

525
00:18:26,844 --> 00:18:28,542
[knocking]

526
00:18:29,847 --> 00:18:31,458
I have a proposal
for you.

527
00:18:31,501 --> 00:18:33,286
And not an

529
00:18:35,331 --> 00:18:38,073
Okay.

530
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,640
Since Connor and Liam are doing

531
00:18:39,683 --> 00:18:41,555
their little guys' night out
at the arcade,

532
00:18:41,598 --> 00:18:44,601
I was thinking we could
have our very own

533
00:18:44,645 --> 00:18:46,777
moms' night out.

534
00:18:46,821 --> 00:18:49,650
Um, wow, that's really sweet.

535
00:18:49,693 --> 00:18:51,130
Ah...But we've got an early
flight tomorrow.

536
00:18:51,173 --> 00:18:53,697
And, as far as I know,
you're not actually a mom.

537
00:18:53,741 --> 00:18:55,308
Well, not technically, no.

538
00:18:55,351 --> 00:18:58,354
But parenting is hard.
I mean, I only did it

539
00:18:58,398 --> 00:19:00,530
for two days and I feel
like I needed a vacation.

540
00:19:00,574 --> 00:19:02,141
Uh, but the point isstarting tomorrow,

541
00:19:02,184 --> 00:19:04,534
you go back to being
a single mom

542
00:19:04,578 --> 00:19:06,536
full-time, so...

543
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:07,972
I don't know,
I just thought tonight

544
00:19:08,016 --> 00:19:09,931
we can go a little crazy,
live a little.

545
00:19:09,974 --> 00:19:11,237
What do you say?

546
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,499
That actually sounds
like a lot of fun.

547
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:16,329
I'm so sorry,

548
00:19:16,372 --> 00:19:18,200
but I wouldn't be doingmy job as a physician

I am eternally gratefulto you and your dear husband.

559
00:19:39,439 --> 00:19:41,571
I'm sorry, but as I was
about to tell the doctor,

is banned in our church.

00:25:13,686 --> 00:25:15,252
We spoke to the valet.

703
00:25:15,296 --> 00:25:17,907
This car was stolen directly
from the hotel's parking lot.

704
00:25:17,951 --> 00:25:20,780
♪

705
00:25:23,478 --> 00:25:25,175
Well?

706
00:25:25,219 --> 00:25:26,786
They didn't find
anything in your room.

707
00:25:26,829 --> 00:25:28,614
I am so sorry.I shouldn't have...

708
00:25:29,702 --> 00:25:31,834
We shouldn't havejumped to conclusions.

709
00:25:31,878 --> 00:25:34,358
I suppose we all make mistakes.

710
00:25:34,402 --> 00:25:35,925
Look, don't even
worry about it, okay?

711
00:25:35,969 --> 00:25:37,579
I just hope you find this guy.

712
00:25:37,623 --> 00:25:40,582
Or at least the watch.

713
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:45,848
Just because they didn't
find it in his room

714
00:25:45,892 --> 00:25:47,458
doesn't mean he didn't
stash it somewhere.

715
00:25:47,502 --> 00:25:49,156
Kirby. You're my temporary
event coordinator,

716
00:25:49,199 --> 00:25:50,374
not my head of security.

717
00:25:50,418 --> 00:25:52,420
Stay in your lane.

718
00:25:56,032 --> 00:25:58,208
I take it that means
the watch hasn't showed up?

719
00:25:58,252 --> 00:26:01,603
No. I'm really sorry,Michael.

720
00:26:01,647 --> 00:26:03,953
If it makes you feel any better,I'm pretty sure my temporary job

721
00:26:03,997 --> 00:26:06,129
is about to turn into
a permanent leave of absence.

722
00:26:06,173 --> 00:26:07,957
[chuckles]
Well, that'd be a shame.

723
00:26:08,001 --> 00:26:09,959
Stolen watch aside,
you did a great job.

724
00:26:10,003 --> 00:26:12,266
Thanks.

725
00:26:12,309 --> 00:26:14,137
Hey, so does this meanwe can be friends again?

726
00:26:14,181 --> 00:26:15,617
Sounds good to me.

727
00:26:15,661 --> 00:26:18,794
Great. So, can I ask youa question, as a friend?

728
00:26:18,838 --> 00:26:20,013
Of course.

729
00:26:20,056 --> 00:26:21,797
Vanessa and her mother?

730
00:26:21,841 --> 00:26:24,887
[groans]
That's not a question.

731
00:26:24,931 --> 00:26:26,976
I followed the techto the morgue,

732
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:29,326
but by the time I managedto get alone with the cadaver,

733
00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:31,111
the liver was useless.

734
00:26:32,895 --> 00:26:34,505
What about other hospitals?

735
00:26:34,549 --> 00:26:37,421
I've checked every hospitalbetween here and Chicago.

736
00:26:37,465 --> 00:26:39,423
There's no one else.

737
00:26:40,468 --> 00:26:41,991
We're out of miracles.

738
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:45,342
Can you tell Jeff?

739
00:26:49,695 --> 00:26:51,435
Where have you been?

740
00:26:51,479 --> 00:26:53,220
And why are you dressed
like a doorman?

741
00:26:53,263 --> 00:26:56,179
Uh, a valet. It's a long story.

742
00:26:56,223 --> 00:26:57,224
I've got time.

743
00:26:57,267 --> 00:26:58,834
Oh, the details
are not important.

744
00:26:58,878 --> 00:27:01,532
It's been three days,and you're already lying to me?

745
00:27:01,576 --> 00:27:03,839
What happened to trying
to be a better person?

746
00:27:03,883 --> 00:27:05,667
Because I'm pretty sure
you didn't spend the night

747
00:27:05,711 --> 00:27:07,016
parking cars
for the less-fortunate.

748
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:09,932
Well, if you must know,
I was helping Fallon

749
00:27:09,976 --> 00:27:10,890
rescuean innocent child

750
00:27:10,933 --> 00:27:12,500
caught in the middle

751
00:27:12,543 --> 00:27:13,849
of a really ugly custody battle.

752
00:27:13,893 --> 00:27:15,155
Oh, yeah?Mm-hmm.

753
00:27:15,198 --> 00:27:16,330
What kind of custody battle

754
00:27:16,373 --> 00:27:17,766
is happening at 10:00 p.m.,

755
00:27:17,810 --> 00:27:19,028
at a valet stand?

756
00:27:20,769 --> 00:27:22,553
That's what I thought.

757
00:27:22,597 --> 00:27:25,556
While you were dropping
everything to rescue Fallon,

758
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,907
our charity program
was collapsing.

759
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:29,430
W-What are you talking about?

760
00:27:29,473 --> 00:27:31,040
Father Kelly is gone.

761
00:27:31,084 --> 00:27:33,216
And the new priest has
no interest in helping.

762
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:35,915
Oh, and your other
child has also proven

763
00:27:35,958 --> 00:27:37,525
to be no help yet again.

764
00:27:37,568 --> 00:27:39,309
And you're blaming me

765
00:27:39,353 --> 00:27:40,702
for Adam's feelings?[sighs]

766
00:27:40,746 --> 00:27:43,574
I blame you for letting himhave that board seat.

767
00:27:43,618 --> 00:27:46,142
And myself for believingthat you were capable of change.

768
00:27:47,404 --> 00:27:49,363
Take a look in the mirror,
Cristal.

769
00:27:49,406 --> 00:27:51,017
You fought to have
Adam kicked out

770
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:52,845
of the family corporation.

771
00:27:52,888 --> 00:27:54,803
You tried to have him banished
to some institution

772
00:27:54,847 --> 00:27:56,022
when he went blind.

773
00:27:56,065 --> 00:27:57,719
You tricked him
into thinking

774
00:27:57,763 --> 00:28:00,026
that I slept
with his girlfriend.

775
00:28:00,069 --> 00:28:01,549
Maybe if you'd worked
a little harder

776
00:28:01,592 --> 00:28:03,029
trying to be a good stepmother,

777
00:28:03,072 --> 00:28:05,684
we wouldn't be
here right now.

778
00:28:05,727 --> 00:28:07,424
You are right.

779
00:28:07,468 --> 00:28:09,209
I did those awful things.

780
00:28:09,252 --> 00:28:13,039
The difference between us is Iam trying to atone for my sins.

781
00:28:19,393 --> 00:28:22,178
[knocking on door]

782
00:28:25,138 --> 00:28:26,617
It's late.

783
00:28:26,661 --> 00:28:28,707
Uh, yeah, I know.

784
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:31,057
[laughs softly]
More bad news?

785
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:34,887
We couldn't find a donor.

786
00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:36,976
No one in your familywas a match.

787
00:28:37,019 --> 00:28:38,281
Okay.

788
00:28:38,325 --> 00:28:39,848
So where does that leave us?

789
00:28:39,892 --> 00:28:42,024
Well, it probably leaves me
going to jail.

790
00:28:42,068 --> 00:28:43,852
You're already showing

791
00:28:43,896 --> 00:28:47,638
symptoms of early-stage
liver failure.

792
00:28:47,682 --> 00:28:50,598
And once that starts
to progress, there's,

793
00:28:50,641 --> 00:28:52,034
there's no coming back.

794
00:28:53,775 --> 00:28:55,734
How long do I have?

795
00:28:55,777 --> 00:28:56,909
My best guess?

796
00:28:56,952 --> 00:28:58,519
Two or three days

797
00:28:58,562 --> 00:29:01,087
before neurological functions
start to diminish.

798
00:29:06,092 --> 00:29:08,747
Is-is there someoneI can call, or...?

799
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:10,792
No.

800
00:29:10,836 --> 00:29:13,708
Would you want your family
to remember you like this?

801
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:15,623
Your friends?

802
00:29:15,666 --> 00:29:18,887
I don't want to putthe people I love through that.

803
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,066
But I, uh,
I do want to make sure

804
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:26,373
everyone's taken care of
after I'm gone.

805
00:29:28,549 --> 00:29:30,333
Would you, uh, do me a favor

806
00:29:30,377 --> 00:29:33,293
and write down
some things for me?

807
00:29:42,128 --> 00:29:44,608
Stashed inside the curtain rod.

808
00:29:46,219 --> 00:29:47,742
Did you think I'd forget
my own trick?

809
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:49,657
Sam, listen, I'm-I'm sorry.

810
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:52,225
Look, I didn't want to embarrassyou in front of the others,

811
00:29:52,268 --> 00:29:54,227
but I can't riskmy hotel's reputation.

812
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:56,142
You need to leave.Come on, okay?

813
00:29:56,185 --> 00:29:57,404
Look, I-I made a mistake.

814
00:29:57,447 --> 00:29:58,666
Ramy, I trusted you.

815
00:29:58,709 --> 00:29:59,928
I gave youa place to stay,

816
00:29:59,972 --> 00:30:01,974
and this is how you thank me?

817
00:30:02,017 --> 00:30:03,758
Man, you're lucky

818
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:06,761
I'm not calling your P.O.Well, go ahead and call him.

819
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:08,850
I-I'll be back in jail
soon enough, right? Why wait?

820
00:30:09,895 --> 00:30:11,853
Stop, man. Don't say that.

821
00:30:11,897 --> 00:30:13,202
No, it's true.
And then I get a chance

822
00:30:13,246 --> 00:30:14,987
to see all over again
that no one cares.

823
00:30:17,032 --> 00:30:19,252
[sighs]
I'm sorry I didn't visit.

824
00:30:19,295 --> 00:30:20,775
I just,

825
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:22,472
it would have been weird.Right.

826
00:30:22,516 --> 00:30:24,692
Because had I opened my mouth
to the police back then,

827
00:30:24,735 --> 00:30:25,954
then you could've
been in there with me.

828
00:30:25,998 --> 00:30:27,564
And then you would'vehad a chance to see

829
00:30:27,608 --> 00:30:29,479
who your real friends are,besides me.

830
00:30:29,523 --> 00:30:32,918
Look, you have no ideawhat it was like in there, Sam.

831
00:30:32,961 --> 00:30:34,354
But I don't want to go back.

832
00:30:36,138 --> 00:30:37,574
Give me another chance.

833
00:30:41,404 --> 00:30:42,623
But you will be watched.

834
00:30:49,282 --> 00:30:50,674
Fallon, Heidi.

835
00:30:50,718 --> 00:30:52,981
Is everything okay?

836
00:30:53,025 --> 00:30:56,202
Uh, not really.
[chuckles]

837
00:30:56,245 --> 00:30:57,681
Heidi jacked a Tesla tonight.

838
00:30:57,725 --> 00:30:58,769
HEIDI:That is not what...

839
00:30:58,813 --> 00:31:00,206
And thank God the
Carrington name

840
00:31:00,249 --> 00:31:02,077
still carries some weight,
because otherwise,

841
00:31:02,121 --> 00:31:04,471
your thieving baby mama
would be behind bars.

842
00:31:04,514 --> 00:31:07,300
I told you it was a mistake.
Why won't you believe me?

843
00:31:07,343 --> 00:31:08,736
Okay, well, you know what?

844
00:31:08,779 --> 00:31:11,173
Doesn't really matter
what I believe.

845
00:31:11,217 --> 00:31:13,219
I just wonder how a
family court judge

846
00:31:13,262 --> 00:31:16,526
will look upon
a single mother with a record

847
00:31:16,570 --> 00:31:18,789
of erratic behavior
and auto theft.

848
00:31:20,356 --> 00:31:21,923
You set me up.

849
00:31:21,967 --> 00:31:23,533
The valet,

850
00:31:23,577 --> 00:31:25,187
saying there was
a back entrance to the hotel,

851
00:31:25,231 --> 00:31:26,188
it was all you.

852
00:31:27,842 --> 00:31:30,540
Liam,
I didn't do anything wrong.

853
00:31:30,584 --> 00:31:31,802
You believe me, right?

854
00:31:33,152 --> 00:31:35,197
Of course I do.

855
00:31:35,241 --> 00:31:37,765
Who do you think swiped
the keys from valet?

856
00:31:37,808 --> 00:31:40,202
FALLON:
And frankly, Heidi,

857
00:31:40,246 --> 00:31:43,379
the auto theft combined with
your little getaway

858
00:31:43,423 --> 00:31:45,816
on the Vaginal Mystery Tour
won't look great.

859
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:47,209
LIAM: Look, this
can all go away,

860
00:31:47,253 --> 00:31:50,560
we just need you to agree
to a couple of things.

861
00:31:50,604 --> 00:31:52,954
Like relocating to Atlanta.

862
00:31:52,998 --> 00:31:56,915
Why are you doing this?Because I can't lose my son
for a second time.

863
00:32:00,179 --> 00:32:02,529
Okay. Or we can just settle thisin front of a judge.

864
00:32:02,572 --> 00:32:04,052
No, you don't understand.

865
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:06,968
It is not that simple.But it can be.

866
00:32:07,012 --> 00:32:10,058
You used to be a kind person,
Heidi. What happened?

867
00:32:10,102 --> 00:32:11,973
I don't know
why you won't compromise.

868
00:32:12,017 --> 00:32:13,235
Is there something wrong
with a father

869
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:15,411
wanting to get to know his son?No, but...

870
00:32:16,673 --> 00:32:18,414
Connor's not your son.

871
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:22,201
I had an affair
with your father.

872
00:32:24,116 --> 00:32:25,334
Connor's your brother.

873
00:32:35,910 --> 00:32:37,390
[sighs] Senior year,

874
00:32:37,433 --> 00:32:41,307
when I went to visit your familyfor Christmas break.

875
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:45,485
You and I were pretty much done,and I had a little...

876
00:32:45,528 --> 00:32:47,313
thing with your dad.

877
00:32:47,356 --> 00:32:49,097
[gags]It was stupid,

878
00:32:49,141 --> 00:32:51,012
and it only happened
a couple of times,

879
00:32:51,056 --> 00:32:54,189
but he wasn't nearly as
responsible as you were.

880
00:32:54,233 --> 00:32:55,451
That's one way to put it.

881
00:32:55,495 --> 00:32:58,150
You knew Connor wasn't mine
all this time?

882
00:33:00,108 --> 00:33:03,416
Then why did you show up here
saying that he was?I really did need a break.

883
00:33:03,459 --> 00:33:05,157
Ugh.And Connor's been asking

884
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,549
about his father nonstop.

885
00:33:06,593 --> 00:33:08,029
So, since his real dadpassed away,

886
00:33:08,073 --> 00:33:11,250
I figured Liam was
the next best thing,

887
00:33:11,293 --> 00:33:13,730
especially when I found out
you two were getting married.

888
00:33:13,774 --> 00:33:17,212
I mean... it seemed like
an ideal family for Connor.

889
00:33:17,256 --> 00:33:18,561
[exhales]

890
00:33:18,605 --> 00:33:19,954
Obviously,
appearances can be deceiving.

891
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:22,304
LIAM:
So, why did you lie
to me back then?

892
00:33:22,348 --> 00:33:24,350
You said it yourself,
we were basically done.

893
00:33:24,393 --> 00:33:26,004
So, why didn't you just
tell me he wasn't mine?

894
00:33:27,744 --> 00:33:29,311
Spit it out, Swiss Miss.

895
00:33:30,356 --> 00:33:33,402
I promised I'd keep the identity

896
00:33:33,446 --> 00:33:34,795
of Connor's real father
a secret.

897
00:33:34,838 --> 00:33:35,796
You promised who?

898
00:33:35,839 --> 00:33:37,885
I can't say.

899
00:33:38,973 --> 00:33:41,671
Obviously, she's talkingabout your mother.

900
00:33:46,589 --> 00:33:49,375
LIAM:
How could you let me think
I had a kid out there

901
00:33:49,418 --> 00:33:50,376
all these years?

902
00:33:50,419 --> 00:33:51,899
Always with the drama.

903
00:33:51,942 --> 00:33:53,292
Huh?Oh, come on.

904
00:33:53,335 --> 00:33:55,250
You worshippedyour father.

905
00:33:55,294 --> 00:33:58,471
I could not risk ruiningthat relationship,

906
00:33:58,514 --> 00:34:00,212
especiallyafter he passed.

907
00:34:00,255 --> 00:34:01,691
What good would that do?

908
00:34:01,735 --> 00:34:03,084
You should be thanking me.

909
00:34:03,128 --> 00:34:05,521
Oh, please. You have never
done a selfless thing

910
00:34:05,565 --> 00:34:06,696
in your whole life.

911
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:08,263
I think you couldn't

912
00:34:08,307 --> 00:34:10,396
stand the idea
of people finding out

913
00:34:10,439 --> 00:34:12,093
that your husband had a son

914
00:34:12,137 --> 00:34:13,921
with a barely legal
high school kid.

915
00:34:13,964 --> 00:34:16,489
That is not true.I did it for Liam.

916
00:34:17,533 --> 00:34:18,534
Liam,

917
00:34:18,578 --> 00:34:20,145
please.

918
00:34:21,885 --> 00:34:25,672
I may not love all your choices,but I love you.

919
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:29,763
Liam, listen to one
of your choices.

920
00:34:29,806 --> 00:34:31,330
Someone who loves you

921
00:34:31,373 --> 00:34:34,072
would never do what
she did to you.

922
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:38,902
You can't trust this woman.

923
00:34:42,776 --> 00:34:44,734
Fallon's right.

924
00:34:44,778 --> 00:34:46,519
Liam.Stop.

925
00:34:46,562 --> 00:34:48,869
I don't want to hear
another word from you.

926
00:34:50,218 --> 00:34:52,307
You know what? And don't bothershowing up at the wedding.

927
00:34:52,351 --> 00:34:53,961
Oh.

928
00:34:55,963 --> 00:34:57,704

The commissionermust have

932
00:35:04,537 --> 00:35:06,147
dropped it when he wasbringing in his luggage.

933
00:35:06,191 --> 00:35:07,801
Do I want to know
the real story?

934
00:35:07,844 --> 00:35:10,804
Well, I'm hoping that if I comp

the entire bar tabfor the evening,

936
00:35:12,458 --> 00:35:14,155
you will convincethe commissioner that is

937
00:35:14,199 --> 00:35:16,679
the real story.The whole tab?

938
00:35:16,723 --> 00:35:18,681
I'll find a way.

939

♪ I get this feeling, it's likeparadise, paradise... ♪

940
00:35:21,554 --> 00:35:23,643
And for what it's worth?

941
00:35:23,686 --> 00:35:25,384
Kirby did a great
job with this party.

942
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:30,389
I'm really sorry, Sam.

943
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:32,042
I just wanted everything
to be perfect

944
00:35:32,086 --> 00:35:34,784
so that you could see how good
I would be if I had this job.

945
00:35:34,828 --> 00:35:38,092
But I... I should never haveaccused your friend of stealing.

946
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:39,746
I just got carried away.

947
00:35:39,789 --> 00:35:41,400
Kirby.
[exhales]

948
00:35:43,837 --> 00:35:45,882
You were just being
a vigilant employee.

949
00:35:47,057 --> 00:35:48,058
I'm the one who's sorry.

950
00:35:48,102 --> 00:35:49,364
I shouldn't have snapped at you.

951
00:35:50,496 --> 00:35:53,194
The job is yours
if you still want it.

952
00:35:53,238 --> 00:35:54,674
Of course I want it.

953
00:35:54,717 --> 00:35:56,458
Well, then,
you're officially hired.

954
00:35:56,502 --> 00:35:57,851
Thank you.

955
00:35:59,113 --> 00:36:00,332
What's wrong?

956
00:36:00,375 --> 00:36:03,117
I can't find my keys.RAMY:
Sam.

957
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:05,728
You, uh, dropped
these in my room.

958
00:36:05,772 --> 00:36:07,556
[sighs]They must have fallen out

959
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,601
while you were fixing
the curtain rod.

960
00:36:09,689 --> 00:36:11,125
You know how to fix
a curtain rod?

961
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:13,910
Long story. Thanks.

962
00:36:13,954 --> 00:36:16,696
Of course. Uh,
see you tomorrow.

963
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,876
Mrs. Colby.

964
00:36:25,052 --> 00:36:26,836
Oh, my God. Did Jeff...

965
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,838
No, no, no, no, no.
He's-he's okay for now.

966
00:36:28,882 --> 00:36:30,231
[sighs]

967
00:36:30,275 --> 00:36:31,972
Um, I've...

968
00:36:32,015 --> 00:36:35,105
I've decided that I'm
going to do the surgery.

969
00:36:36,542 --> 00:36:38,718
Donate, not perform it.[exhales]

970
00:36:38,761 --> 00:36:41,024
But you saidyou might not survive.

971
00:36:41,068 --> 00:36:42,983
I might not.

972
00:36:43,026 --> 00:36:44,506
But I took a vow

973
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:45,942
to do no harm,

974
00:36:45,986 --> 00:36:47,422
and I can't let Jeff die

975
00:36:47,466 --> 00:36:48,902
if there's something I
can do to prevent it.

976
00:36:48,945 --> 00:36:50,208
You can't do yourself harm,

977
00:36:50,251 --> 00:36:52,035
either.[sighs]

978
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:53,385
Come here.

979
00:36:57,084 --> 00:37:01,610
Last night, I realized how many
people Jeff's leaving behind.

980
00:37:01,654 --> 00:37:03,960
And if I die in surgery,

981
00:37:04,004 --> 00:37:05,701
at this point,

982
00:37:05,745 --> 00:37:08,835
nobody besides you
is gonna even notice.

983
00:37:11,272 --> 00:37:13,231
I don't want you to die.

984
00:37:14,928 --> 00:37:16,886
I don't want to, either.

985
00:37:20,977 --> 00:37:22,327
Oh.

986
00:37:22,370 --> 00:37:23,763
Mrs. Carrington.

987
00:37:23,806 --> 00:37:25,634
Uh, what are you...

988
00:37:25,678 --> 00:37:27,549
[chuckles]

989
00:37:29,812 --> 00:37:31,597
Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.

990
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,686
It's been three weeks
since my last confession.

991
00:37:34,730 --> 00:37:36,297
You know what?

992
00:37:36,341 --> 00:37:38,517
It's good enough.

993
00:37:44,044 --> 00:37:46,481
So, tell me
what's troubling you.

994
00:37:46,525 --> 00:37:48,483
Someone recently
accused me

995
00:37:48,527 --> 00:37:51,573
of being political
and manipulative.

996
00:37:51,617 --> 00:37:52,966
And they were right.

997
00:37:53,009 --> 00:37:56,361
This clinic was supposed to be
my absolution,

998
00:37:56,404 --> 00:37:59,146
but even it's become corrupt.

999
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:01,322
Feels like every day,

1000
00:38:01,366 --> 00:38:03,019
I'm getting further
from God's graces,

1001
00:38:03,063 --> 00:38:05,979
and I'm afraid
that someday soon,

1002
00:38:06,022 --> 00:38:08,242
I won't be able
to find my way back.

1003
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:11,854
Well, God doesn't forsake
his children.

1004
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:15,858
I know I can't undo
the harm I've caused,

1005
00:38:15,902 --> 00:38:18,992
but I can vow to put good
into the world

1006
00:38:19,035 --> 00:38:20,689
from here on out.

1007
00:38:21,734 --> 00:38:23,736
If you'll help me.

1008
00:38:28,871 --> 00:38:30,177
I'll talk to the board.

1009
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:32,092
But it's only becauseI'd hate to see tears

1010
00:38:32,135 --> 00:38:35,095
and, well, I really do loveveterans as much as you.

1011
00:38:36,139 --> 00:38:37,010
I can't thank you enough.

1012
00:38:37,053 --> 00:38:38,446
And...

1013
00:38:38,490 --> 00:38:40,056
I really am sorry

1014
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:42,058
about getting off to such
a rocky start, Father.

1015
00:38:42,102 --> 00:38:43,451
Oh...And...

1016
00:38:43,495 --> 00:38:45,584
[exhales]
I can't believe

1017
00:38:45,627 --> 00:38:47,194
I accused you
of flirting with me.

1018
00:38:47,237 --> 00:38:49,109
Oh.[chuckles]

1019
00:38:49,152 --> 00:38:51,111
I mean, I definitely wasflirting with you.

1020
00:38:51,154 --> 00:38:53,026
And I...

1021
00:38:53,069 --> 00:38:55,333
really look forwardto working together. [chuckles]

Five Hail Marys
and one Our Father.

1023
00:39:00,163 --> 00:39:02,427
I'm sorry again
about the whole...

1024
00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:04,690
auto theft thing.It's okay.

1025
00:39:04,733 --> 00:39:07,736
I know in your own
incredibly twisted way,

1026
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:09,390
you were just trying
to protect Connor.

1027
00:39:09,434 --> 00:39:11,827
I'm glad he has someonelike you in his corner.

1028
00:39:12,872 --> 00:39:14,526
I'm gonna miss you, buddy.

1029
00:39:14,569 --> 00:39:16,266
Me, too.

1030
00:39:17,093 --> 00:39:19,052
Are you gonna come visit me?

1031
00:39:23,099 --> 00:39:24,362
All the time.

1032
00:39:25,624 --> 00:39:27,365
And hey, no matter what,

1033
00:39:27,408 --> 00:39:29,149
we're family, okay?

1034
00:39:29,192 --> 00:39:31,281
Okay.

1035
00:39:39,202 --> 00:39:41,204
[knock on door]

1036
00:39:42,641 --> 00:39:45,034
Ah, Fallon.I just wanted
to thank you.

1037
00:39:45,078 --> 00:39:46,862
It meant a lot to me
that you were willing

1038
00:39:46,906 --> 00:39:49,125
to violate
your new do-gooder vow

1039
00:39:49,169 --> 00:39:50,257
to help me destroy

1040
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:51,476
an innocent woman's credibility

1041
00:39:51,519 --> 00:39:52,651
and steal her kid.

1042
00:39:52,694 --> 00:39:54,043
It's the type of thing

1043
00:39:54,087 --> 00:39:55,523
father-daughter memories
are made of.

1044
00:39:55,567 --> 00:39:57,264
Well, it was nice
to spend time together,

1045
00:39:57,307 --> 00:39:59,353
that's for sure.
I've missed you.

1046
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:02,878
Good. Because Liam and Iare moving back into the manor.

1047
00:40:03,836 --> 00:40:05,794
This is my home.

1048
00:40:05,838 --> 00:40:08,449
And also, La Miragehas a terrible breakfast buffet.

1049
00:40:08,493 --> 00:40:09,537
And,

1050
00:40:09,581 --> 00:40:10,669
compared to Laura,

1051
00:40:10,712 --> 00:40:11,844
you're parent of the year.

1052
00:40:11,887 --> 00:40:13,280
I'll take it.

Oh.

00:40:17,458 --> 00:40:20,461
So, what were the skeletons
in Alexis's closet?

1057
00:40:20,505 --> 00:40:23,899
I mean, what was so bad that
she was willing to leave me?

1058
00:40:23,943 --> 00:40:26,467
Oh, I can't tell you that.

1059
00:40:26,511 --> 00:40:27,642
Not to protect Alexis.

1060
00:40:27,686 --> 00:40:29,165

Can I get you something?

I don't recall
asking your opinion.
