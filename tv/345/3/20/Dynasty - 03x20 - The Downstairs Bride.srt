00:09:31,753 --> 00:09:34,506
- To do what?
- Guess, just guess.
去干什么
是猜测 只是猜测

135
00:09:35,753 --> 00:09:38,665
He's not gonna try and reconcile
with that tramp, is he?
他不是想和那个流浪女和解吧 对吗

136
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:41,142
Well, whether he comes back here
with or without her,
不管他能否带回她来

137
00:09:41,313 --> 00:09:43,224
I've got something to ask you
right now.
我现在想和你商量

138
00:09:43,713 --> 00:09:45,988
Not on the basis of decency,
God knows,
不是什么体面的事情
上帝才知道

139
00:09:46,153 --> 00:09:49,384
but because I'm sure
that you really love your son.
可我想你是爱你的儿子的

140
00:09:49,553 --> 00:09:51,589
Can we come to a joint decision?
我们能否共同做一个决定

141
00:09:54,393 --> 00:09:56,668
What kind of a joint decision?
什么样的共同决定

142
00:09:56,993 --> 00:10:02,465
Not to turn our son into a battleground
to settle our own personal interests.
不要将我们的儿子卷入你我之间的争斗当中

143
00:10:03,273 --> 00:10:05,229
Now, I'm determined
to make peace with Steven.
现在我想和斯蒂文言归于好

144
00:10:06,673 --> 00:10:08,823
I'm prepared to do anything
to bury the past,
只要是忘记过去 我可以做任何让步

145
00:10:08,993 --> 00:10:10,426
but I'm gonna need help.
可我需要帮助

146
00:10:10,593 --> 00:10:11,708
Yours.
你的帮助

147
00:10:13,753 --> 00:10:16,142
Well, do we have a deal?
我们能否达成一笔交易

148
00:10:18,713 --> 00:10:21,466
Well, Steven is our son.
斯蒂文是我们的儿子

149
00:10:21,633 --> 00:10:24,591
He's yours and he's mine.
是你的 也是我的

150
00:10:25,033 --> 00:10:27,103
Yes, we have a deal.
是的 我们可以达成一笔交易

151
00:10:28,033 --> 00:10:29,705
Good.
好的

152
00:10:41,313 --> 00:10:42,951
- Morning, Mother.
- Good morning, darling.
早上好 妈妈
早上好 亲爱的

153
00:10:43,113 --> 00:10:45,468
What did father want
at this hour of the morning?
我父亲这么早来此
有什么事情吗

154
00:10:45,633 --> 00:10:48,625
What he wants, Adam,
isn't important.
他想做什么并不重要 亚当

155
00:10:48,793 --> 00:10:50,624
What I want is.
我现在想的是

156
00:10:50,793 --> 00:10:53,944
Now, you promised me once
that you would be a brother,
你要答应我 你要当好兄长的角色

157
00:10:54,113 --> 00:10:55,865
a true brother to Steven.
作为斯蒂文的兄长

158
00:10:56,033 --> 00:10:58,103
Big brother. Yes, I remember.

159
00:10:59,393 --> 00:11:02,146
Now's your chance
to keep that promise.

160
00:11:02,713 --> 00:11:05,307
You usually smile when you have
a grand plan going, Mother.

161
00:11:05,473 --> 00:11:06,826
You're not smiling now.

162
00:11:08,033 --> 00:11:09,830
Listen to me, Adam.

163
00:11:09,993 --> 00:11:13,303
Now, I know that you're not
particularly fond of Steven,

164
00:11:15,553 --> 00:11:17,908
but I want you
to become friends with him.

165
00:11:18,433 --> 00:11:20,071
It's funny, isn't it?

166
00:11:20,233 --> 00:11:22,269
You don't think I like Steven.

167
00:11:23,073 --> 00:11:24,108
But I do.

168
00:11:26,233 --> 00:11:28,542
I never had a kid brother before.

169
00:11:28,953 --> 00:11:31,547
I never had a friend.
Not a real friend.

170
00:11:32,433 --> 00:11:35,072
I just hope to God Steven likes me.

171
00:11:46,113 --> 00:11:47,182
Well, here we are.

172
00:11:47,513 --> 00:11:50,152
I see my father didn't arrange
for a brass band.

173
00:11:50,313 --> 00:11:51,541
Not even a string quartet.

174
00:11:51,713 --> 00:11:53,943
Well, whatever his problem is--

175
00:11:54,513 --> 00:11:57,073
Jeff. Kirby.

176
00:12:00,993 --> 00:12:02,267
Welcome back.

177
00:12:02,433 --> 00:12:03,388
Congratulations.

178
00:12:03,553 --> 00:12:04,781
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

179
00:12:04,953 --> 00:12:07,751
I was just on my way to the hotel,
check things out.

180
00:12:08,113 --> 00:12:09,546
How's it going?

181
00:12:09,913 --> 00:12:12,347
Oh, fine. The same.

182
00:12:12,553 --> 00:12:14,509
Well, you two look wonderful.

183
00:12:14,673 --> 00:12:16,072
Can I see your ring?

184
00:12:18,593 --> 00:12:19,742
It's very pretty.

185
00:12:20,913 --> 00:12:24,223
We bought it in a hurry at the
Reno airport, if you can believe that.

186
00:12:24,393 --> 00:12:25,621
Oh, I can.

187
00:12:25,793 --> 00:12:28,353
Slot machines, wedding bands,
all part of the big--

188
00:12:28,513 --> 00:12:29,912
The big what?

189
00:12:30,073 --> 00:12:31,062
Gamble?

190
00:12:31,233 --> 00:12:32,712
Sorry.

191
00:12:32,873 --> 00:12:36,661
It's just that this is so unexpected,
I'm not as witty as I might be.

192
00:12:38,753 --> 00:12:40,664
Well, Jeff,
I know you wanna see Little Blake.

193
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:44,030
I'll go back upstairs with you. I wanna
give him an extra kiss goodbye.

194
00:12:44,553 --> 00:12:46,703
Kirby, I know you'll
wanna see your father.

195
00:12:47,033 --> 00:12:49,342
I'm sure he's waiting for me.

196
00:12:56,673 --> 00:12:58,026
Hi.

197
00:12:58,673 --> 00:13:00,823
Here.

198
00:13:03,913 --> 00:13:06,746
Look, I didn't mean to behave
the way I did downstairs, I just--

199
00:13:06,913 --> 00:13:08,551
Oh, what was so wrong?

200
00:13:08,713 --> 00:13:10,624
You were just
trying to make a little joke.

201
00:13:10,793 --> 00:13:14,422
I mean, that is you, Fallon, isn't it?
The smart-talking Carrington?

202
00:13:14,913 --> 00:13:16,471
What are you thinking right now?

203
00:13:17,153 --> 00:13:19,906
"Here today, gone tomorrow."'
Come on, let's hear it.

204
00:13:20,953 --> 00:13:24,707
Well, today's just
not my day for quips, okay?

205
00:13:26,153 --> 00:13:29,190
Look, Jeff,
you and I couldn't make it work.

206
00:13:29,953 --> 00:13:32,308
But I'm glad you and Kirby will.

207
00:13:32,473 --> 00:13:34,987
It's wonderful for you and I'm glad.

208
00:13:35,153 --> 00:13:36,381
Do you really mean that?

209
00:13:36,953 --> 00:13:38,989
Yes, and--

210
00:13:39,433 --> 00:13:40,661
And what?

211
00:13:41,433 --> 00:13:45,108
And I was just thinking I should
probably arrange a party for you both.

212
00:13:45,273 --> 00:13:46,991
Or somebody should.

213
00:13:51,873 --> 00:13:53,784
That's a nice thought.

214
00:13:54,553 --> 00:13:56,191
But...

215
00:13:56,593 --> 00:13:59,187
Well, let's talk about it
some other time.

216
00:14:00,793 --> 00:14:02,351
Fallon, I want you to know that it's--

217
00:14:02,513 --> 00:14:04,424
It's going to work
between Kirby and me.

218
00:14:07,393 --> 00:14:10,271
Because it-- Well, because it is.

219
00:14:15,073 --> 00:14:17,462
I also want you to know, though...

220
00:14:19,193 --> 00:14:21,707
Well, there's something
inside me that's--

221
00:14:23,713 --> 00:14:25,385
That's never gonna stop loving you.

222
00:14:26,633 --> 00:14:28,351
Don't say that, Jeff.

223
00:14:28,513 --> 00:14:30,151
You're on to a new life now.

224
00:14:30,913 --> 00:14:33,268
The new wipes out the old.

225
00:14:33,553 --> 00:14:35,066
Let's hope so.

226
00:15:05,113 --> 00:15:08,992
Mrs. Gunnerson told me you were
downstairs checking a wine delivery.

227
00:15:09,153 --> 00:15:11,428
I said I'd wait for you here.

228
00:15:11,593 --> 00:15:12,582
I'm home, Papa.

229
00:15:13,473 --> 00:15:15,668
What am I supposed to say to that?

230
00:15:16,113 --> 00:15:19,583
What I wanted you to say
on the phone: congratulations.

231
00:15:19,753 --> 00:15:21,983
For ruining your life?

232
00:15:22,153 --> 00:15:23,142
How am I ruining my life?

233
00:15:23,313 --> 00:15:25,383
I'm married to a man
I love very, very much.

234
00:15:25,553 --> 00:15:26,827
At the moment.

235
00:15:26,993 --> 00:15:28,472
I always have.

236
00:15:28,633 --> 00:15:31,750
Even when you were having
an affair in Paris with Jean-Paul?

237
00:15:31,913 --> 00:15:33,107
Yes.

238
00:15:33,273 --> 00:15:36,071
Oh, Papa, say it, please?
"Congratulations."'

239
00:15:36,233 --> 00:15:37,985
What I'm going to say is this,
daughter:

240
00:15:38,153 --> 00:15:41,429
You're not of the same world
as the Colbys and the Carringtons.

241
00:15:41,593 --> 00:15:43,106
I find that funny. Very funny.

242
00:15:43,273 --> 00:15:44,342
Because I remember a time

243
00:15:44,513 --> 00:15:47,346
when you were all for me marrying
into the upper classes,

244
00:15:47,513 --> 00:15:50,505
when I was with Jean-Paul,
before I knew he had a wife.

245
00:15:50,673 --> 00:15:52,265
That's not the same thing.

246
00:15:52,433 --> 00:15:54,105
Then what is it you're thinking?

247
00:15:54,273 --> 00:15:55,422
That the people in this house,

248
00:15:55,593 --> 00:15:57,584
who've known me practically
since I was born,

249
00:15:57,753 --> 00:16:00,472
are not gonna let me forget
that I'm a major-domo's daughter?

250
00:16:00,633 --> 00:16:04,148
Or that they've always thought that
they're better than we are, is that it?

251
00:16:04,673 --> 00:16:07,233
Why on Earth would they think that
about the downstairs girl

252
00:16:07,393 --> 00:16:11,511
who finally had her wish
and became the upstairs bride?

253
00:16:11,673 --> 00:16:14,392
Why would your loving husband
ever think about that?

254
00:16:14,553 --> 00:16:16,828
You seem to think that he will.

255
00:16:16,993 --> 00:16:19,382
That someday Jeff and l
are gonna have an argument

256
00:16:19,553 --> 00:16:21,544
and he's gonna bring it up,
he's gonna hit me with it.

257
00:16:21,713 --> 00:16:23,669
Remind me
of my humble beginnings.

258
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:25,869
Yes, maybe. In fact, probably.

259
00:16:26,033 --> 00:16:27,591
Is that a prediction?

260
00:16:27,753 --> 00:16:29,505
You seem to have all the answers.

261
00:16:29,673 --> 00:16:31,629
Why don't you answer that question
for yourself.

262
00:16:35,593 --> 00:16:37,470
I have a question for you.

263
00:16:37,633 --> 00:16:40,784
From this moment on,
what am I supposed to call you?

264
00:16:40,953 --> 00:16:43,069
Mrs. Colby? Madame?

265
00:16:43,233 --> 00:16:44,985
Your royal highness?

266
00:16:45,153 --> 00:16:46,745
Don't answer that.

267
00:16:47,193 --> 00:16:48,467
As the major-domo
of the household,

268
00:16:48,633 --> 00:16:52,182
I'll come up with
the proper form eventually.

269
00:17:03,353 --> 00:17:05,071
I'm very happy for you, Jeff.

270
00:17:05,233 --> 00:17:06,905
My best wishes
to both you and Kirby.

271
00:17:07,073 --> 00:17:08,301
Thank you, Blake.

272
00:17:08,473 --> 00:17:10,828
Glad to see you looking so well.

273
00:17:10,993 --> 00:17:13,188
- You sound surprised.
- No, no.

274
00:17:13,353 --> 00:17:15,264
Well, it's just that
after all you've been through,

275
00:17:15,433 --> 00:17:17,583
and then this thing happening
so suddenly.

276
00:17:17,753 --> 00:17:20,506
And you're wondering if I got married
without knowing what I was doing.

277
00:17:20,673 --> 00:17:21,662
Right?

278
00:17:23,553 --> 00:17:27,068
Look, Blake, I know you always wanted
it to work out with Fallon and me.

279
00:17:27,233 --> 00:17:28,427
Well, it didn't.

280
00:17:31,193 --> 00:17:32,546
Jeff,

281
00:17:32,913 --> 00:17:35,222
you have always been
like a son to me, you know that.

282
00:17:35,393 --> 00:17:38,590
And I was hoping that you would
always be my son-in-law,

283
00:17:39,153 --> 00:17:43,385
but I guess life just doesn't work out
the way we want it to all the time.

284
00:17:43,553 --> 00:17:45,384
Important thing
is for you to be happy.

285
00:17:45,553 --> 00:17:48,386
Well, Blake, I'm married now.
I'm gonna be happy.

286
00:17:48,553 --> 00:17:51,147
But look, I don't wanna
talk about that right now.

287
00:17:51,313 --> 00:17:53,622
What I do wanna talk about is this:

288
00:17:54,153 --> 00:17:55,711
I wanna sue Alexis.

289
00:17:56,673 --> 00:17:58,425
On what grounds?

290
00:17:58,753 --> 00:18:02,507
On the grounds that I signed over
my son's stock when I wasn't fit.

291
00:18:02,673 --> 00:18:04,982
I was sick,
I didn't know what I was doing.

292
00:18:08,913 --> 00:18:10,710
I can't let you do that, Jeff.

293
00:18:10,873 --> 00:18:12,784
Blake, I can do anything I want.

294
00:18:13,393 --> 00:18:15,384
I won't let you do it.

295
00:18:15,753 --> 00:18:18,267
Now, look, I don't have to remind you

296
00:18:18,433 --> 00:18:21,106
that she's planning on merging
Denver-Carrington with Colbyco.

297
00:18:21,273 --> 00:18:22,945
She's waiting there to bury you.

298
00:18:23,313 --> 00:18:28,671
I know that, and I'm gonna fight that,
but I can't let you go into court.

299
00:18:28,873 --> 00:18:32,991
Well, first of all, it would take years
for that litigation to go through.

300
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:34,871
Meanwhile,
it's gonna be mother's milk

301
00:18:35,033 --> 00:18:37,103
for every newspaper editor
in the state,

302
00:18:37,273 --> 00:18:38,706
in the country,

303
00:18:38,873 --> 00:18:40,909
to print that when you signed
those papers,

304
00:18:41,073 --> 00:18:42,631
that you were temporarily insane.

305
00:18:42,793 --> 00:18:44,829
And that's the way they'll put it,
believe me.

306
00:18:45,353 --> 00:18:48,026
Well, Blake, if it doesn't bother me,
why should it bother you?

307
00:18:48,193 --> 00:18:51,390
Your reputation could be clouded
for a long time to come.

308
00:18:51,553 --> 00:18:53,225
Maybe even the rest of your life.

309
00:18:53,393 --> 00:18:55,748
And it could conceivably
affect your son.

310
00:18:56,273 --> 00:18:57,501
Blake, it's my fault.

311
00:18:57,673 --> 00:19:00,233
I signed that paper. I'm the one
who put you where you are.

312
00:19:00,393 --> 00:19:01,508
It doesn't matter.

313
00:19:01,673 --> 00:19:05,348
I'm gonna be in there fighting Alexis,
but I'm going to fight her my way.

314
00:19:07,153 --> 00:19:09,223
Now, that board meeting
has not been convened yet.

315
00:19:09,393 --> 00:19:11,065
Neal McVane is in Washington

316
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:14,270
trying to convince the right people
not to consider that merger,

317
00:19:14,433 --> 00:19:15,707
even if it is presented.

318
00:19:15,873 --> 00:19:18,023
So I'm not out of weapons yet.

319
00:19:18,193 --> 00:19:20,184
And I will not allow you
to put your head on the block

320
00:19:20,353 --> 00:19:21,342
when you don't have to.

321
00:19:21,513 --> 00:19:23,151
End of discussion.

322
00:19:23,873 --> 00:19:25,625
All right.

323
00:19:27,873 --> 00:19:30,387
Well, Jeff, I'd be very happy

324
00:19:30,553 --> 00:19:34,512
if you and Kirby would consider
staying on at the house for a while.

325
00:19:34,993 --> 00:19:38,303
You've got enough pressures
hanging over you right now anyway,

326
00:19:38,473 --> 00:19:41,192
and we could both use
one another's support.

327
00:19:42,953 --> 00:19:44,830
I'll think about it.

328
00:19:52,953 --> 00:19:54,671
Hello, Elizabeth.

329
00:20:00,513 --> 00:20:04,188
- Who is it?
- Steven, it's Adam, may I come in?

330
00:20:04,353 --> 00:20:05,706
Sure.

331
00:20:06,393 --> 00:20:07,712
- Hi.
- Hi.

332
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:09,352
Oh, I'm glad I caught you.

333
00:20:09,513 --> 00:20:12,186
Now, we didn't have much time
to spend together when you got back.

334
00:20:12,353 --> 00:20:14,309
Yeah, I know,
I'm really sorry about that too.

335
00:20:14,473 --> 00:20:15,701
- Unfortunately--
- Yes, I know.

336
00:20:15,873 --> 00:20:17,352
You're ready to leave town.

337
00:20:17,513 --> 00:20:19,504
Well, before you go,
I just wanna tell you

338
00:20:19,673 --> 00:20:22,745
how much I admire your courage
for what you went through.

339
00:20:22,913 --> 00:20:24,107
May l?

340
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:25,462
Thank you.

341
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:28,791
And I regret having grown up
without a brother,

342
00:20:28,953 --> 00:20:31,467
and I hope that we get
to know one another better.

343
00:20:31,633 --> 00:20:32,702
Thanks. I hope so too.

344
00:20:32,873 --> 00:20:34,022
And I appreciate your coming,

345
00:20:34,193 --> 00:20:36,184
it's just that right now
I really have no time.

346
00:20:36,353 --> 00:20:38,662
Of course,
you're off to New York to see that girl.

347
00:20:38,833 --> 00:20:40,585
My wife.

348
00:20:42,353 --> 00:20:43,991
Steven,
I know it's none of my business,

349
00:20:44,153 --> 00:20:46,826
but I've heard a lot about her.

350
00:20:47,753 --> 00:20:49,311
I've known girls like her.

351
00:20:49,473 --> 00:20:51,350
So I'd say leave well enough alone.

352
00:20:52,153 --> 00:20:55,111
Who sent you here
with that bit of fraternal advice, Adam?

353
00:20:55,833 --> 00:20:57,107
My father? My mother?

354
00:20:57,273 --> 00:20:59,946
No, you're wrong.
I came on my own.

355
00:21:00,353 --> 00:21:03,265
And look,
when you get to know me better,

356
00:21:03,433 --> 00:21:06,152
you'll know that I don't make
judgements about people.

357
00:21:06,553 --> 00:21:09,386
Is that what you rushed over
to talk about? My lifestyle?

358
00:21:09,553 --> 00:21:10,747
No, believe me.

359
00:21:11,153 --> 00:21:13,030
But it does have
something to do with it.

360
00:21:13,753 --> 00:21:15,391
Steven, look,

361
00:21:15,553 --> 00:21:17,669
I've been around a lot
more than you.

362
00:21:17,833 --> 00:21:20,108
I mean, sleeping with girls.

363
00:21:20,273 --> 00:21:22,070
How can you know
the baby's even yours?

364
00:21:22,473 --> 00:21:25,192
Because I know he is, Adam.

365
00:21:26,873 --> 00:21:29,546
And if you're asking me
if I ever went to bed with my wife,

366
00:21:29,713 --> 00:21:32,181
and if I ever made love to my wife,
I did.

367
00:21:32,353 --> 00:21:34,821
Now, get lost, Brother.

368
00:21:46,273 --> 00:21:48,150
Adam, I'd like to see you
in the library.

369
00:21:48,313 --> 00:21:49,712
Why?

370
00:21:50,033 --> 00:21:52,228
To talk about Steven.

371
00:21:52,673 --> 00:21:53,947
Krystle, I have things to do.

372
00:21:54,113 --> 00:21:55,944
Whatever it is, it can wait.

373
00:21:56,113 --> 00:21:58,752
What I have to say to you can't.

374
00:22:09,793 --> 00:22:11,863
What kind of a brother are you?

375
00:22:12,033 --> 00:22:14,342
How could you say something
like that to him?

376
00:22:14,993 --> 00:22:16,631
About his sexual preference?

377
00:22:17,113 --> 00:22:21,629
Well, that's national news, isn't it?
Ever since my father's trial.

378
00:22:21,913 --> 00:22:23,949
Tell me something, Krystle.

379
00:22:24,673 --> 00:22:27,233
Did something happen
when my back was turned?

380
00:22:27,393 --> 00:22:28,712
What does that mean?

381
00:22:30,793 --> 00:22:33,591
You suddenly seem
to have become Steven's mother.

382
00:22:34,393 --> 00:22:36,031
No, Adam,

383
00:22:36,193 --> 00:22:38,070
I'm not Steven's mother.

384
00:22:38,233 --> 00:22:39,985
But I am his friend.

385
00:22:40,353 --> 00:22:43,311
And I want you to know
he was my first friend in this house,

386
00:22:43,473 --> 00:22:46,192
back in the days when everyone else
was hostile to me.

387
00:22:46,793 --> 00:22:50,024
And where I come from,
one friend defends another.

388
00:22:50,193 --> 00:22:51,421
Ohio, wasn't it?

389
00:22:51,593 --> 00:22:52,708
Where embraces flourish,

390
00:22:52,873 --> 00:22:55,831
along with
sometimes hot-tempered ladies?

391
00:22:55,993 --> 00:22:59,429
Adam, Steven needs support
from all of us, you know that.

392
00:22:59,593 --> 00:23:01,185
Yes, I do.

393
00:23:01,353 --> 00:23:02,911
And so does mother.

394
00:23:03,073 --> 00:23:04,108
But if she sees fit--

395
00:23:04,273 --> 00:23:06,628
Sees fit to what?

396
00:23:09,193 --> 00:23:10,706
Steven was right.

397
00:23:10,873 --> 00:23:12,386
She did send you.

398
00:23:12,553 --> 00:23:13,952
No.

399
00:23:14,753 --> 00:23:16,584
She may have suggested it,

400
00:23:17,273 --> 00:23:18,752
but then l--

401
00:23:19,233 --> 00:23:20,825
But then what?

402
00:23:25,473 --> 00:23:27,191
Never mind. Forget it.

403
00:23:27,913 --> 00:23:32,589
Adam, tell your mother that no matter
what she had on her mind,

404
00:23:32,833 --> 00:23:34,869
Steven's on his way to New York.

405
00:23:53,673 --> 00:23:55,823
We're going to stay here?
Is that what you're telling me?

406
00:23:55,993 --> 00:23:57,949
That's right. For a while.

407
00:24:03,193 --> 00:24:06,822
We're not going to find a house
of our own?

408
00:24:06,993 --> 00:24:09,746
Jeff, Fallon lives in this house.

409
00:24:09,913 --> 00:24:11,232
- She's your--
- She's my ex-wife

410
00:24:11,393 --> 00:24:13,111
and she has nothing to do with it.

411
00:24:13,273 --> 00:24:14,626
How many times
do I have to say that?

412
00:24:14,793 --> 00:24:17,023
How many times
do we have to talk about Fallon?

413
00:24:18,353 --> 00:24:20,821
Then it's your son.
You wanna be near him.

414
00:24:20,993 --> 00:24:23,143
We can find a house close by,
you can see him every day.

415
00:24:23,313 --> 00:24:24,302
You know that.

416
00:24:24,473 --> 00:24:26,065
No, there are other things.

417
00:24:26,233 --> 00:24:28,542
And finding the right house
will take time.

418
00:24:31,793 --> 00:24:34,102
Now, I've gotta go downtown again.

419
00:24:34,513 --> 00:24:36,822
It's all complicated.
Blake's in trouble and I got him there,

420
00:24:36,993 --> 00:24:38,711
and I gotta get him out of it.

421
00:24:38,873 --> 00:24:41,103
Now, everything's going to be fine.

422
00:24:41,273 --> 00:24:42,991
You know that.

423
00:25:03,113 --> 00:25:04,671
I heard the news.

424
00:25:04,833 --> 00:25:06,391
You and Jeff.

425
00:25:07,553 --> 00:25:09,748
And felicitations?

426
00:25:11,553 --> 00:25:12,952
You are so dumb.

427
00:25:13,113 --> 00:25:16,264
You are so dumb, Mrs. Colby.

428
00:25:16,433 --> 00:25:19,345
"Mrs. Colby."' Is that a first?

429
00:25:20,033 --> 00:25:23,105
No, Mr. Carrington,
a bellboy in Reno beat you to it.

430
00:25:23,273 --> 00:25:25,787
Don't walk away from me, Kirby.

431
00:25:25,993 --> 00:25:28,951
And don't try to walk away
from the truth.

432
00:25:29,113 --> 00:25:31,069
You married Jeff Colby for his money
and his name.

433
00:25:31,233 --> 00:25:34,509
And you aren't fooling anybody,
especially not me.

434
00:25:34,913 --> 00:25:36,505
You see,

435
00:25:36,833 --> 00:25:39,791
we are cut
from the same calico cloth.

436
00:25:39,953 --> 00:25:42,387
Now, I know we each have to climb
these gilt-edged walls

437
00:25:42,553 --> 00:25:45,863
in our separate fashions,
but why did you choose him?

438
00:25:46,033 --> 00:25:47,944
When I could've had you?

439
00:25:49,513 --> 00:25:51,071
Oh, we had a night that night.

440
00:25:51,233 --> 00:25:54,305
That night was a mistake. I still get
sick when I remember that night.

441
00:25:54,473 --> 00:25:57,863
- Do you really?
- Now get your hands off of me.

442
00:25:58,033 --> 00:26:01,070
And I forbid you
to ever touch me again.

443
00:26:01,433 --> 00:26:03,025
Forbid?

444
00:26:03,473 --> 00:26:06,033
Spoken like a true mistress
of the manse, Kirby, well done.

445
00:26:06,193 --> 00:26:08,502
And so quickly too.

446
00:26:08,953 --> 00:26:10,352
But you'll be back with me.

447
00:26:10,513 --> 00:26:12,424
Married or not,

448
00:26:12,593 --> 00:26:14,709
you and I aren't finished.

449
00:26:14,873 --> 00:26:16,147
Married?

450
00:26:16,433 --> 00:26:19,072
Jeff married Kirby Anders?

451
00:26:19,233 --> 00:26:20,985
I thought you might've heard by now.

452
00:26:21,793 --> 00:26:23,226
No.

453
00:26:23,833 --> 00:26:25,744
No, I hadn't heard.

454
00:26:26,953 --> 00:26:29,262
Mother, I know
the news is surprising.

455
00:26:29,633 --> 00:26:31,908
I didn't think it would
hit you this hard.

456
00:26:32,233 --> 00:26:33,951
Why is it so important?

457
00:26:34,113 --> 00:26:35,990
Why does it matter so much to you?

458
00:26:36,793 --> 00:26:39,261
Because of what you did to Jeff,
that's why.

459
00:26:41,713 --> 00:26:43,624
Kirby had nothing to do with that.

460
00:26:44,593 --> 00:26:47,710
She is married to the man
that you tried to poison.

461
00:26:47,873 --> 00:26:50,341
Maybe she'll try
and find out what happened.

462
00:26:50,513 --> 00:26:54,665
That girl is as insolent as her father,
but she is intelligent.

463
00:26:54,833 --> 00:26:56,664
She'll start digging.

464
00:26:56,833 --> 00:26:59,666
And maybe
she'll discover something.

465
00:26:59,833 --> 00:27:01,391
There's nothing to discover.

466
00:27:01,553 --> 00:27:04,590
The panels with the paint have been
destroyed. I gave that order myself.

467
00:27:05,633 --> 00:27:07,430
I don't think that's it.

468
00:27:07,593 --> 00:27:10,107
No? Then what do you think it is?

469
00:27:10,513 --> 00:27:13,949
I think there's something else
in this thing with Jeff and Kirby.

470
00:27:19,073 --> 00:27:20,552
Mother,

471
00:27:22,273 --> 00:27:24,264
I think you know something I don't.

472
00:27:26,433 --> 00:27:28,424
Adam, I know many things
that you don't.

473
00:27:28,593 --> 00:27:32,029
I know about wine,
I know about art and music.

474
00:27:32,193 --> 00:27:33,865
And life, of course.

475
00:27:34,033 --> 00:27:35,864
Yes, you can throw that one in.

476
00:27:36,033 --> 00:27:37,705
You also know something I don't.

477
00:27:37,873 --> 00:27:41,468
The question is,
do I get filled in or not?

478
00:27:43,353 --> 00:27:45,503
Adam, you're beginning to bore me.

479
00:27:47,273 --> 00:27:48,501
Sorry.

480
00:28:08,273 --> 00:28:10,582
- Fallon?
- Come in.

481
00:28:14,313 --> 00:28:15,871
Business is bad

482
00:28:16,033 --> 00:28:18,501
and you can't afford
to pay the electric bill.

483
00:28:19,193 --> 00:28:23,186
I'm tied up with my thoughts.
I can't seem to get anywhere.

484
00:28:24,833 --> 00:28:27,063
Your ex-husband came home
with his new bride

485
00:28:27,233 --> 00:28:29,906
and there's a hollow feeling
inside of you.

486
00:28:31,353 --> 00:28:32,911
I'm happy for them.

487
00:28:33,313 --> 00:28:34,541
Maybe.

488
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:36,112
I am.

489
00:28:36,273 --> 00:28:39,071
But you're confused
and even kind of miserable.

490
00:28:41,433 --> 00:28:44,345
Hey, I went through that when I heard
that Krystle married your father.

491
00:28:44,513 --> 00:28:47,869
You know,
what were my inadequacies?

492
00:28:48,033 --> 00:28:50,547
What happened to the great moments
we had together, right?

493
00:28:51,273 --> 00:28:52,501
No.

494
00:28:52,673 --> 00:28:55,665
Fallon, come on, you're talking to me.
The guy in Haiti, remember?

495
00:28:55,833 --> 00:28:58,825
When all we did was talk?
Serious talk.

496
00:29:00,633 --> 00:29:03,705
What are you,
a tennis pro or a shrink?

497
00:29:04,793 --> 00:29:08,502
If you're a shrink,
maybe I should lie on the couch.

498
00:29:10,473 --> 00:29:13,749
Maybe you can get me an office
with a big leather couch.

499
00:29:13,953 --> 00:29:15,750
And then I'll moonlight.

500
00:29:16,313 --> 00:29:18,747
Not until I pay my electric bill.

501
00:29:20,233 --> 00:29:21,712
I would make a good shrink.

502
00:29:21,873 --> 00:29:25,104
God knows I've known all kinds
of women with all kinds of problems.

503
00:29:25,833 --> 00:29:28,188
There he goes, bragging again.

504
00:29:28,353 --> 00:29:30,742
Yeah, that seems to be
my kind of style.

505
00:29:31,553 --> 00:29:33,623
At least I have something
going for me.

506
00:29:35,113 --> 00:29:37,502
You have a lot going for you, Mark.

507
00:29:37,673 --> 00:29:40,392
You are one of the few people I know
who's really himself.

508
00:29:40,553 --> 00:29:42,305
Like my brother Steven.

509
00:29:42,473 --> 00:29:44,031
And that's rare.

510
00:29:44,193 --> 00:29:47,424
Okay. So you'd make a good shrink.

511
00:29:47,593 --> 00:29:50,061
And you wanna continue analysing
my plight?

512
00:29:50,433 --> 00:29:52,105
No, I've got the cure.

513
00:30:11,593 --> 00:30:15,825
Well, just what
every tired businessman needs.

514
00:30:15,993 --> 00:30:21,465
A lovely lady on the floor next to a fire,
a pitcher full of martinis.

515
00:30:23,753 --> 00:30:25,948
The only thing that doesn't go
with the picture is,

516
00:30:26,113 --> 00:30:28,104
why are you so pensive, darling?

517
00:30:30,713 --> 00:30:32,192
I was just thinking.

518
00:30:32,353 --> 00:30:35,390
About Jeff and Kirby.

519
00:30:35,553 --> 00:30:37,032
And about you.

520
00:30:37,193 --> 00:30:39,423
Oh, how did I get into this?

521
00:30:40,753 --> 00:30:43,984
I know deep in your heart

522
00:30:44,433 --> 00:30:47,391
you've always hoped that Fallon
and Jeff would get together again.

523
00:30:47,553 --> 00:30:51,546
Yes, I did. But obviously,
that is never going to take place.

524
00:30:53,593 --> 00:30:56,630
Now, what exactly is on your mind.

525
00:30:56,793 --> 00:30:58,863
What else are you thinking about?

526
00:31:00,633 --> 00:31:02,589
Well, how everybody in this house

527
00:31:02,753 --> 00:31:05,142
is shocked by Jeff
and Kirby's marriage,

528
00:31:05,313 --> 00:31:06,985
their so-called impulsiveness.

529
00:31:07,313 --> 00:31:08,871
And I know what they're thinking.

530
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:11,263
"Marry in haste, repent in leisure."'

531
00:31:11,433 --> 00:31:14,982
Darling, that wouldn't have become
a truism if it weren't often true.

532
00:31:15,153 --> 00:31:16,427
I know that.

533
00:31:16,593 --> 00:31:18,549
But we have to give them a chance.

534
00:31:18,713 --> 00:31:21,147
I mean, they are already married.

535
00:31:21,953 --> 00:31:24,865
And one of the things
that might be a problem

536
00:31:25,033 --> 00:31:27,422
is the uncomfortable position
Kirby's in,

537
00:31:27,593 --> 00:31:29,743
reversing her place in this house.

538
00:31:29,913 --> 00:31:31,904
- And--
- And what?

539
00:31:32,073 --> 00:31:33,984
Well, someone should talk
to Joseph.

540
00:31:34,793 --> 00:31:36,385
I mean, her own father
is making her feel

541
00:31:36,553 --> 00:31:38,271
more uncomfortable
than anyone else.

542
00:31:39,393 --> 00:31:40,872
Now,

543
00:31:41,273 --> 00:31:42,865
I could do it, I know--

544
00:31:43,033 --> 00:31:46,264
But coming from me,
it would have double authority.

545
00:31:47,313 --> 00:31:48,792
Yes.

546
00:31:53,593 --> 00:31:55,982
My beautiful wife,

547
00:31:56,393 --> 00:31:58,782
always thinking
about someone else.

548
00:31:59,113 --> 00:32:01,422
I love you for that. I always have.

549
00:32:01,593 --> 00:32:03,584
More than you'll ever know.

550
00:32:08,753 --> 00:32:11,631
All right, of course, I'll talk to Joseph.
Anything you want.

551
00:32:12,233 --> 00:32:16,988
But since you're not quite dressed
for dinner yet,

552
00:32:17,593 --> 00:32:21,381
what would happen
if we decided to skip dinner tonight?

553
00:32:23,073 --> 00:32:24,506
Well,

554
00:32:25,313 --> 00:32:27,907
probably be a scandal downstairs.

555
00:32:28,513 --> 00:32:30,344
Let's risk it.

556
00:32:49,673 --> 00:32:50,992
Who is it?

557
00:32:51,153 --> 00:32:52,666
Steven.

558
00:32:57,793 --> 00:32:59,306
Hello, Steven.

559
00:32:59,793 --> 00:33:02,432
- It is you.
- Sammy Jo.

560
00:33:05,313 --> 00:33:06,871
Aren't you gonna come in?

561
00:33:22,873 --> 00:33:25,182
A taxi from the airport
must've been hard to find.

562
00:33:25,353 --> 00:33:26,911
It's been over an hour
since you phoned.

563
00:33:27,073 --> 00:33:28,142
Yeah.

564
00:33:28,313 --> 00:33:29,826
But I made it.

565
00:33:30,273 --> 00:33:33,504
Looks like you're doing well here
in the Big Apple.

566
00:33:34,753 --> 00:33:37,904
Don't let this place fool you.
I haven't paid next month's rent yet.

567
00:33:38,073 --> 00:33:42,351
It's due in a couple days,
but I'll manage.

568
00:33:42,713 --> 00:33:44,146
Modelling.

569
00:33:45,593 --> 00:33:48,949
Well, your father sends me
a little money.

570
00:33:49,113 --> 00:33:50,432
I guess you know that.

571
00:33:50,593 --> 00:33:52,424
And right, modelling.

572
00:33:52,593 --> 00:33:55,869
They putting out any calls
for a young guy with a new face?

573
00:33:56,033 --> 00:33:57,386
And a cane.

574
00:33:57,553 --> 00:33:59,145
Real distinguished, huh?

575
00:34:00,033 --> 00:34:01,705
How long will you have to use that?

576
00:34:02,593 --> 00:34:04,504
Not long.

577
00:34:08,033 --> 00:34:11,548
Well, I guess this is what you'd call
appropriately awkward conversation

578
00:34:11,713 --> 00:34:14,273
between two people who haven't seen
each other in a while.

579
00:34:16,033 --> 00:34:18,069
Not since that night in Hollywood.

580
00:34:18,913 --> 00:34:20,744
Why are you here, Steven?

581
00:34:20,913 --> 00:34:22,983
I thought we said goodbye
in Hollywood.

582
00:34:23,273 --> 00:34:25,264
I wanna talk to you, Sammy Jo.

583
00:34:28,633 --> 00:34:30,351
There's a great little restaurant
downtown

584
00:34:30,513 --> 00:34:32,549
that I dream about
every once in a while.

585
00:34:32,713 --> 00:34:34,112
The food's that good.

586
00:34:34,793 --> 00:34:36,988
They stay open till 2.
So, what do you say?

587
00:34:37,153 --> 00:34:39,667
You wanna go grab a bite to eat
with me and we can talk there?

588
00:34:44,073 --> 00:34:45,062
All right.

589
00:35:00,033 --> 00:35:03,070
You want me to come back to you,
the three of us together.

590
00:35:03,233 --> 00:35:06,191
- Is that what you're saying?
- Yes.

591
00:35:06,793 --> 00:35:10,263
Well, maybe it wouldn't be so bad.

592
00:35:10,433 --> 00:35:11,866
We could get an apartment.

593
00:35:12,033 --> 00:35:13,705
You know,
overlooking the East River,

594
00:35:13,873 --> 00:35:15,670
and then a summer place
in the Hamptons.

595
00:35:15,833 --> 00:35:19,303
Or even better, Connecticut. Westport.
Oh, that would be more fun.

596
00:35:19,473 --> 00:35:21,384
And we could afford it.

597
00:35:22,073 --> 00:35:24,189
At least your father could.

598
00:35:24,513 --> 00:35:27,949
Sammy Jo, I'm not talking about
taking any money from my father.

599
00:35:28,113 --> 00:35:29,228
I don't need it.

600
00:35:29,393 --> 00:35:31,827
I'll get a job and I'll support us.

601
00:35:31,993 --> 00:35:33,790
And I'm not talking about living here.

602
00:35:33,953 --> 00:35:36,262
I'm talking about Denver.
Going back home.

603
00:35:37,073 --> 00:35:38,506
Home?

604
00:35:38,913 --> 00:35:41,381
Maybe your home, Steven,
but not mine.

605
00:35:41,553 --> 00:35:43,623
I'm here. And I'm staying.

606
00:35:44,113 --> 00:35:45,228
But you just said--

607
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:49,784
"Maybe it wouldn't be so bad.
Two of us, together again."'

608
00:35:50,073 --> 00:35:52,029
It'd be rotten and you know it.

609
00:35:52,193 --> 00:35:53,865
And you know why.

610
00:35:54,033 --> 00:35:56,672
If you're thinking
what I know you are,

611
00:35:57,153 --> 00:35:59,064
I haven't touched a man.

612
00:35:59,233 --> 00:36:01,986
Not in a long time. A very long time.

613
00:36:02,833 --> 00:36:05,745
But you haven't stopped thinking
about them, have you?

614
00:36:07,753 --> 00:36:09,630
This place,

615
00:36:09,833 --> 00:36:12,984
your favourite restaurant downtown.

616
00:36:13,473 --> 00:36:16,385
Isn't that where you lived
with your boyfriend? Ted Dinard?

617
00:36:18,833 --> 00:36:20,266
Isn't it?

618
00:36:20,673 --> 00:36:22,186
Yes, but--

619
00:36:22,593 --> 00:36:24,982
Isn't this where you used to come
to eat with him?

620
00:36:25,153 --> 00:36:28,509
This great little restaurant
you told me you dreamed about?

621
00:36:28,833 --> 00:36:30,391
Once. Maybe twice.

622
00:36:30,553 --> 00:36:31,827
Oh, I'll bet.

623
00:36:33,233 --> 00:36:34,985
Nothing's changed, Steven.

624
00:36:36,673 --> 00:36:38,550
Not with me and not with you.

625
00:36:38,713 --> 00:36:42,149
At least I know who I am
and what I want out of life.

626
00:36:43,553 --> 00:36:45,464
And I don't want you.

627
00:36:47,833 --> 00:36:51,348
Just like I don't want a baby
who was a mistake.

628
00:36:51,513 --> 00:36:53,185
He's our son.

629
00:36:53,353 --> 00:36:56,151
He's a beautiful boy
and he's our son.

630
00:36:56,313 --> 00:36:58,429
He's the baby you gave birth to.

631
00:36:58,593 --> 00:37:00,424
Yeah. You know why?

632
00:37:02,193 --> 00:37:04,582
Because I was afraid
to have an abortion.

633
00:37:05,353 --> 00:37:07,105
And you don't love him?

634
00:37:07,793 --> 00:37:09,988
I don't know him.

635
00:37:10,153 --> 00:37:14,112
How can you know eight pounds
of a kid? Of any kid?

636
00:37:14,353 --> 00:37:16,583
I can't believe you're saying this.

637
00:37:16,753 --> 00:37:18,823
I can't believe
that when you see him again,

638
00:37:18,993 --> 00:37:20,745
and when you see
that I've changed--

639
00:37:21,153 --> 00:37:22,825
But you haven't changed.

640
00:37:22,993 --> 00:37:24,904
Because you can't change.

641
00:37:25,353 --> 00:37:28,026
What's it gonna be,
the two of us together again?

642
00:37:28,193 --> 00:37:32,471
You laying in bed with me,
sometimes even making love to me.

643
00:37:32,633 --> 00:37:34,589
But not really to me.

644
00:37:34,753 --> 00:37:35,947
To a ghost.

645
00:37:36,593 --> 00:37:39,346
- Sammy Jo, listen to me--
- No, you listen to me.

646
00:37:39,913 --> 00:37:43,269
I didn't do such a bad job of thinking
about Danny's best interests.

647
00:37:43,433 --> 00:37:46,152
At least I put him with people
who can give him what he needs,

648
00:37:46,313 --> 00:37:47,951
including a normal upbringing.

649
00:37:50,073 --> 00:37:53,509
You wanna do your thing
with other guys, go do it.

650
00:37:53,673 --> 00:37:56,267
But if you really give a damn
about your son,

651
00:37:56,433 --> 00:37:59,231
Iet him grow up
with a straight family.

652
00:37:59,593 --> 00:38:02,232
Don't stick him with you for a father.

653
00:38:06,473 --> 00:38:09,306
I'm not hungry. I'll take a taxi back.

654
00:38:11,553 --> 00:38:14,113
Before you go,
I want to ask you one thing.

655
00:38:14,433 --> 00:38:17,823
Did you really try to sell him
to my father like a piece of goods?

656
00:38:19,113 --> 00:38:21,308
Let's just say I thought about it.

657
00:38:21,473 --> 00:38:24,192
I never got anything else from you,
did l?

658
00:38:37,513 --> 00:38:40,505
I think that you like
this plain little old wedding band.

659
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:43,871
Well, I love it.

660
00:38:44,033 --> 00:38:45,910
I love the man who gave it to me.

661
00:38:46,073 --> 00:38:48,029
Just like I love you,

662
00:38:48,193 --> 00:38:52,152
Iike I couldn't love you more
if you were my own handsome boy.

663
00:38:52,313 --> 00:38:53,541
Which he isn't, Kirby.

664
00:38:54,033 --> 00:38:56,149
I only meant that--

665
00:38:56,313 --> 00:38:58,907
Oh, no apologies necessary.
I know what you meant.

666
00:39:02,913 --> 00:39:05,473
Fallon, I'm happy and Jeff's happy.

667
00:39:05,633 --> 00:39:07,112
We know you're going to be happy.

668
00:39:07,673 --> 00:39:10,585
Do you mind, Kirby? I'd like
to spend some time with my son.

669
00:39:15,393 --> 00:39:16,826
Hi.

670
00:39:17,113 --> 00:39:18,592
Hi.

671
00:39:25,593 --> 00:39:27,424
What the devil are you doing here,
Sam?

672
00:39:27,593 --> 00:39:29,902
I know. I'm supposed to be off fishing
in the Bahamas

673
00:39:30,073 --> 00:39:31,984
where your ex-wife
couldn't track me down.

674
00:39:32,153 --> 00:39:33,142
Except that she did.

675
00:39:33,313 --> 00:39:36,464
Sure as that seaplane landed next
to my boat and handed me this.

676
00:39:36,633 --> 00:39:38,032
Now, listen.

677
00:39:38,193 --> 00:39:40,753
"Attention: Samuel Dexter.

678
00:39:40,913 --> 00:39:44,110
I intend to hold merger meeting
with you there or not.

679
00:39:44,473 --> 00:39:48,466
If you are absent l, as a holder of
majority interest in Denver-Carrington,

680
00:39:48,633 --> 00:39:51,067
shall present my own list of nominees
for the board,

681
00:39:51,233 --> 00:39:53,793
and have their election confirmed
by the courts.

682
00:39:54,153 --> 00:39:56,030
Alexis Colby."'

683
00:39:56,193 --> 00:39:57,990
No love and kisses.

684
00:39:58,153 --> 00:39:59,552
I'm hamstrung, Blake.

685
00:39:59,713 --> 00:40:01,385
The meeting's called for tomorrow.

686
00:40:01,953 --> 00:40:04,831
But you will not be there,
is that clear?

687
00:40:04,993 --> 00:40:07,712
Because I'm gonna have Andrew Laird
down at court in the morning

688
00:40:07,873 --> 00:40:12,469
arguing that she got this majority
by her typically dirty pool.

689
00:40:12,633 --> 00:40:14,908
No, I'm sorry, Blake.
I can't take that risk.

690
00:40:15,673 --> 00:40:17,072
You can't? Why not?

691
00:40:17,233 --> 00:40:19,701
What if Laird's arguments
are tossed out? I've got no choice.

692
00:40:19,873 --> 00:40:22,307
I own stock
in Denver-Carrington too.

693
00:40:22,473 --> 00:40:25,670
And you're fighting a personal battle,
it seems to me,

694
00:40:25,833 --> 00:40:27,551
and this is a business battle.

695
00:40:27,713 --> 00:40:29,783
Yes, my business.

696
00:40:29,953 --> 00:40:32,069
A company that I built up
from nothing.

697
00:40:32,233 --> 00:40:35,430
A company that made you a rich man,
a very rich man.

698
00:40:37,793 --> 00:40:39,670
I'm sorry, Blake.

699
00:40:40,553 --> 00:40:41,952
Blake, I'm your friend.

700
00:40:42,113 --> 00:40:43,705
I always will be, I hope.

701
00:40:43,873 --> 00:40:47,229
But gratitude isn't the name
of the game in this part of our world.

702
00:40:47,393 --> 00:40:50,351
I'm back and I'll be at that meeting.

703
00:40:50,833 --> 00:40:54,143
Anyway, the fishing was lousy.

704
00:41:12,833 --> 00:41:13,948
Steven.

705
00:41:14,113 --> 00:41:16,502
Oh, darling, I'm so glad you're back.

706
00:41:16,673 --> 00:41:19,107
I'm here because your chauffeur
was waiting for me at the airport.

707
00:41:19,273 --> 00:41:21,070
The guy practically kidnapped me.

708
00:41:21,233 --> 00:41:23,349
Well, I was so anxious to see you.

709
00:41:23,513 --> 00:41:25,310
Come and sit down.

710
00:41:25,473 --> 00:41:28,829
Now, I know that you called
from New York about the baby and--

711
00:41:28,993 --> 00:41:31,666
Well, since you
were coming back alone--

712
00:41:31,833 --> 00:41:34,267
Without Sammy Jo, that's right.

713
00:41:34,433 --> 00:41:36,583
Which I'm sure pleases you.

714
00:41:36,833 --> 00:41:39,427
Darling, what pleases me
is that you obviously,

715
00:41:39,593 --> 00:41:42,790
and finally, saw that girl
for what she really was.

716
00:41:42,953 --> 00:41:45,467
But that's all in the past now.

717
00:41:45,633 --> 00:41:47,430
The reason
that I practically kidnapped you

718
00:41:47,593 --> 00:41:51,302
was to talk about your future with me
at Colbyco.

719
00:41:51,473 --> 00:41:54,545
Mother,
I can't give you an answer yet.

720
00:41:54,713 --> 00:41:56,863
Another part of my future
hasn't been settled,

721
00:41:57,033 --> 00:41:58,671
the most important part:

722
00:41:58,833 --> 00:42:01,063
What I intend to do about my son.

723
00:42:01,633 --> 00:42:03,305
I understand, darling.

724
00:42:03,473 --> 00:42:07,386
But what I really want you to know
is that I'm praying that you'll say yes.

725
00:42:08,193 --> 00:42:09,865
Well, thanks for wanting me.

726
00:42:10,033 --> 00:42:11,068
But right now--

727
00:42:11,233 --> 00:42:13,952
Right now you have
other things on your mind.

728
00:42:14,113 --> 00:42:15,705
I understand.

729
00:42:15,873 --> 00:42:18,307
I've always understood you, darling.

730
00:42:18,473 --> 00:42:21,465
Better than your father,
better than Fallon,

731
00:42:21,633 --> 00:42:23,146
better than all of them.

732
00:42:23,313 --> 00:42:26,032
Promise me
that you'll bear that in mind.

733
00:42:26,193 --> 00:42:28,946
- I promise.
- Good.

734
00:42:35,033 --> 00:42:36,989
Move into your own apartment?
Why?

735
00:42:37,153 --> 00:42:38,381
Easy answer, Dad?

736
00:42:38,553 --> 00:42:40,509
I'm going to make a life for myself
and my son,

737
00:42:40,673 --> 00:42:43,233
and I intend to raise him
as a single parent. Alone.

738
00:42:43,393 --> 00:42:46,942
- I don't understand that.
- Try, Dad. Try.

739
00:42:47,113 --> 00:42:48,705
Krystle.

740
00:42:50,433 --> 00:42:52,264
Yes, Steven?

741
00:42:53,953 --> 00:42:55,944
I know how much you love Danny.

742
00:42:56,393 --> 00:42:59,305
And I'm grateful for all the love
and care you've given him.

743
00:42:59,473 --> 00:43:01,031
But he is my son.

744
00:43:01,193 --> 00:43:03,912
He's my responsibility and I'm the one
who has to take care of him.

745
00:43:04,073 --> 00:43:05,426
You understand that, don't you?

746
00:43:06,753 --> 00:43:08,266
Of course I understand.

747
00:43:08,433 --> 00:43:09,468
Well, I don't.

748
00:43:09,633 --> 00:43:12,830
Here stands my son,
obstinate as always.

749
00:43:12,993 --> 00:43:14,711
My son who's--

750
00:43:18,113 --> 00:43:23,233
Steven, all we want for this child here
is to be surrounded by a real family.

751
00:43:23,393 --> 00:43:27,068
A whole family, and not some--
Some--

752
00:43:27,233 --> 00:43:30,270
Say it.
You can speak plainer than that, Dad.

753
00:43:30,433 --> 00:43:32,947
You don't want Danny
to have a gay for a father.

754
00:43:33,113 --> 00:43:34,102
Well, don't worry.

755
00:43:34,273 --> 00:43:36,389
Because your grandson will be able
to choose for himself

756
00:43:36,553 --> 00:43:38,862
who and what he wants to be
when he grows up.

757
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:41,263
Yes, with you as an example?

758
00:43:41,433 --> 00:43:42,627
Blake!

759
00:43:42,793 --> 00:43:43,987
No, Krystle, don't.

760
00:43:44,153 --> 00:43:45,791
Don't get him to apologise to me.

761
00:43:45,953 --> 00:43:48,183
Don't get him to say,
"I'm sorry, son, I didn't mean it."'

762
00:43:48,353 --> 00:43:49,502
Because he did.

763
00:43:51,713 --> 00:43:53,510
There are mornings
when I wake up in bed

764
00:43:53,673 --> 00:43:55,629
and I'm perspiring and trembling,

765
00:43:55,793 --> 00:43:58,626
and I ask myself,
is it me or is it my life here,

766
00:43:58,793 --> 00:43:59,942
being back in this house?

767
00:44:00,113 --> 00:44:02,149
Just being back in this house.

768
00:44:03,833 --> 00:44:05,232
Well, I don't think it's me, Dad.

769
00:44:05,393 --> 00:44:07,588
And I'm getting out of here
as soon as I can.

770
00:44:07,753 --> 00:44:09,823
Me and my son.

771
00:44:10,033 --> 00:44:11,910
I'm gonna bring him up
to the nursery, all right?

772
00:44:12,073 --> 00:44:13,188
- All right.
- Now, Steven,

773
00:44:13,353 --> 00:44:15,264
we are not finished
talking about this.

774
00:44:15,433 --> 00:44:17,469
I insist that we talk this out.

775
00:44:17,633 --> 00:44:18,782
- Steven.
- Blake.

776
00:44:18,953 --> 00:44:20,909
- Steven!
- Blake, let him go, please.

777
00:44:21,073 --> 00:44:22,711
Try to see it his way.

778
00:44:22,873 --> 00:44:24,943
His way?
Have you suddenly lost your mind?

779
00:44:25,113 --> 00:44:28,310
If you try to stop him,
you may never see Danny again.

780
00:44:28,473 --> 00:44:30,543
And that would break your heart

781
00:44:30,713 --> 00:44:31,907
and mine.
