00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,418
- <i>Previously on</i> Dynasty...
- Will you marry me?

2
00:00:02,442 --> 00:00:04,150
You know who's gonna tune in to see you

3
00:00:04,226 --> 00:00:05,934
and your unknown daughter? No one.

4
00:00:06,011 --> 00:00:08,070
This woman killed my unborn baby.

5
00:00:08,147 --> 00:00:10,568
There needs to be a
price for her actions.

6
00:00:10,603 --> 00:00:11,605
MICHAEL: <i>Vanessa's back in town.</i>

7
00:00:11,642 --> 00:00:14,179
- If she ever found out about us...
- Michael, relax.

8
00:00:14,203 --> 00:00:16,403
<i>Last night can be our little secret.</i>

9
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,664
See, there are plenty of other
pharma companies I can buy.

10
00:00:18,741 --> 00:00:19,935
But there's only one C.A.

11
00:00:19,959 --> 00:00:21,149
<i>And it will be mine.</i>

12
00:00:21,227 --> 00:00:22,228
BLAKE: <i>Well, if it's war they want,</i>

13
00:00:22,244 --> 00:00:23,544
it's war they'll get.

14
00:00:26,548 --> 00:00:28,490
Wait, this is the music
you're suggesting?

15
00:00:28,567 --> 00:00:30,400
"Sweet Caroline"?

16
00:00:30,477 --> 00:00:33,111
This is an engagement party,
not a bat mitzvah.

17
00:00:33,188 --> 00:00:34,212
Oy vey.

18
00:00:34,289 --> 00:00:35,313
So, what are you thinking?

19
00:00:35,391 --> 00:00:37,074
I have a call out to
John Mayer's people.

20
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:38,209
(SCOFFS) Really?

21
00:00:38,285 --> 00:00:40,244
He's a very talented
blues guitarist, okay?

22
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,454
Great. So can we make
some other decisions now?

23
00:00:42,531 --> 00:00:43,839
I need to get back to the hotel.

24
00:00:43,916 --> 00:00:46,199
There's a lot I need to do
between now and the party.

25
00:00:46,234 --> 00:00:47,918
Okay. Well, we have to wait
until Liam gets here.

26
00:00:47,953 --> 00:00:48,880
And I don't know what
kind of a mood you're in.

27
00:00:48,904 --> 00:00:50,295
You're very cranky.
Is it because the married man

28
00:00:50,372 --> 00:00:51,630
- broke up with you?
- Yeah,

29
00:00:51,707 --> 00:00:53,048
that's definitely part of it.

30
00:00:53,125 --> 00:00:54,350
ALEXIS: I'm here! Ooh!

31
00:00:54,426 --> 00:00:56,927
I hope these are mimosas,
because we have a party to plan

32
00:00:57,004 --> 00:00:58,262
and an engagement to celebrate.

33
00:00:58,338 --> 00:00:59,596
Now, when I give my speech...

34
00:00:59,673 --> 00:01:01,598
No. No speech.

35
00:01:01,675 --> 00:01:03,934
How did you even find out about
this meeting? You weren't invited.

36
00:01:04,011 --> 00:01:06,111
- It was in my calendar.
- How did it get in your calendar?

37
00:01:06,188 --> 00:01:08,008
I might have come by yesterday
to sneak a peek at your schedule

38
00:01:08,032 --> 00:01:09,481
when your assistant was in the bathroom.

39
00:01:09,558 --> 00:01:11,275
- I told Allison to keep an eye out for you.
- (SCOFFS)

40
00:01:11,351 --> 00:01:13,702
You know, this is exactly
why I hate labor laws.

41
00:01:13,779 --> 00:01:15,871
- Okay, guys, I don't have all day.
- (TABLET CHIMES)

42
00:01:15,948 --> 00:01:17,614
- What?
- Liam isn't coming.

43
00:01:17,691 --> 00:01:18,785
He said something came up.

44
00:01:19,168 --> 00:01:21,159
- Is everything okay?
- I-I don't know.

45
00:01:21,236 --> 00:01:22,544
I mean, I thought it was.

46
00:01:22,621 --> 00:01:25,547
London and the proposal...
it was amazing and so romantic.

47
00:01:25,624 --> 00:01:27,165
But ever since we got back,
he's been weird.

48
00:01:27,242 --> 00:01:29,668
You know, being a newlywed myself...

49
00:01:29,745 --> 00:01:30,910
- Oh. Here we go.
- Oh, my God.

50
00:01:30,988 --> 00:01:32,963
...it's important to keep
up that fiery passion

51
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,391
or you risk losing the spark entirely.

52
00:01:35,467 --> 00:01:37,704
Please never say "fiery passion" again.

53
00:01:37,728 --> 00:01:40,040
Liam is probably starting
to think of you as his wife,

54
00:01:40,064 --> 00:01:41,375
not his girlfriend.

55
00:01:41,399 --> 00:01:43,307
It's not quite as exciting when one is

56
00:01:43,383 --> 00:01:45,901
"getting the milk for free,"
as the kids say.

57
00:01:45,978 --> 00:01:47,547
No kids say that.

58
00:01:47,571 --> 00:01:48,979
But you do have a point.

59
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:51,982
I mean, I suppose I could
spice things up a little.

60
00:01:52,059 --> 00:01:56,245
You know, remind Mr. Ridley
exactly how lucky he is.

61
00:01:56,794 --> 00:01:57,821
DOMINIQUE: <i>Cristal.</i>

62
00:01:57,898 --> 00:02:01,417
Just the sister-in-law
I was looking for.

63
00:02:01,493 --> 00:02:02,537
Dominique. For a moment,

64
00:02:02,561 --> 00:02:03,752
I almost forgot you were living here.

65
00:02:03,829 --> 00:02:04,920
It was nice.

66
00:02:04,997 --> 00:02:07,423
You might want to rethink your tone,

67
00:02:07,499 --> 00:02:09,403
all things considered.

68
00:02:09,427 --> 00:02:12,094
I'm sure Blake would be very interested

69
00:02:12,171 --> 00:02:15,097
to hear about your
mysterious hotel guest.

70
00:02:15,132 --> 00:02:16,173
You followed me?

71
00:02:16,249 --> 00:02:17,841
I think you're focusing on
the wrong issue, sweetie.

72
00:02:17,918 --> 00:02:20,552
- What did you hear?
- Hear? I didn't stick around long enough

73
00:02:20,629 --> 00:02:22,082
to catch the audiobook.

74
00:02:22,106 --> 00:02:24,106
I know a cheater when I see one.

75
00:02:25,926 --> 00:02:28,277
I made a mistake.

76
00:02:28,354 --> 00:02:30,729
I was having an affair with...

77
00:02:30,806 --> 00:02:33,615
that man, but I...
it didn't mean anything and I ended it.

78
00:02:33,692 --> 00:02:35,451
That's why I went there that day.

79
00:02:35,527 --> 00:02:38,737
Still, I'm sure your husband
wouldn't like hearing about

80
00:02:38,814 --> 00:02:40,789
- your little mistake.
- Just tell me what you want.

81
00:02:40,866 --> 00:02:43,770
I'm inviting Vanessa
to live in the manor.

82
00:02:43,794 --> 00:02:46,280
And you are going to
welcome her with open arms.

83
00:02:46,315 --> 00:02:47,746
Fine. Just...

84
00:02:47,823 --> 00:02:49,414
please don't tell Blake anything.

85
00:02:49,491 --> 00:02:51,467
Don't worry.
It will be our little secret.

86
00:02:51,543 --> 00:02:53,635
I'm glad we could come to an agreement.

87
00:02:57,883 --> 00:02:59,424
(SIGHS)

88
00:02:59,501 --> 00:03:01,426
I may have been a little harsh

89
00:03:01,503 --> 00:03:04,429
when I threatened to
expel you from the loft.

90
00:03:04,506 --> 00:03:05,959
You mean when you banished me

91
00:03:05,983 --> 00:03:07,983
and threatened to cut
me out of the will?

92
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:10,027
Well, you did burn down my vineyard.

93
00:03:12,472 --> 00:03:15,157
We all do crazy things when we...

94
00:03:15,234 --> 00:03:17,275
think we've lost something precious.

95
00:03:18,094 --> 00:03:19,161
I know I have. (CHUCKLES)

96
00:03:20,823 --> 00:03:22,498
I want you to move back,

97
00:03:22,574 --> 00:03:24,074
here where you belong.

98
00:03:24,151 --> 00:03:25,316
That's very generous, but Mother and I

99
00:03:25,394 --> 00:03:26,952
are finally in a good
place and I don't want

100
00:03:27,028 --> 00:03:28,620
to betray her trust by moving back here.

101
00:03:28,697 --> 00:03:31,340
So I assume she's told you about Jeff?

102
00:03:31,417 --> 00:03:33,208
- His illness?
- What illness?

103
00:03:33,285 --> 00:03:34,709
Well... (EXHALES)

104
00:03:34,786 --> 00:03:36,678
whatever you used to poison him,

105
00:03:36,755 --> 00:03:39,089
it worked just a little too well.

106
00:03:39,166 --> 00:03:42,592
He has some degenerative
condition called, uh,

107
00:03:42,669 --> 00:03:44,261
neurotoxicity.

108
00:03:44,337 --> 00:03:46,096
But I guess if your mother
didn't tell you that, she...

109
00:03:46,173 --> 00:03:48,690
must still not trust you completely.

110
00:03:49,348 --> 00:03:52,102
Jeff is days away from having his offer

111
00:03:52,179 --> 00:03:55,439
to buy Carrington Atlantic
accepted by the VKI board.

112
00:03:55,515 --> 00:03:58,700
I can make them aware of
his illness and prognosis.

113
00:03:58,777 --> 00:03:59,868
Might stop the sale...

114
00:03:59,945 --> 00:04:01,537
Seeing as I'm the one who poisoned him,

115
00:04:01,613 --> 00:04:05,541
that might put me in an
unpleasant legal situation.

116
00:04:05,617 --> 00:04:08,827
Which is exactly why I need
an alternative strategy.

117
00:04:08,904 --> 00:04:11,288
I think Jeff is
blackmailing Dustin Sawyer,

118
00:04:11,364 --> 00:04:13,026
the current CEO of C.A.

119
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:15,083
I suppose it's possible.

120
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:18,128
I want you to get that blackmail
so I can use it as leverage.

121
00:04:18,205 --> 00:04:20,389
If Jeff and I are on a level
playing field, he won't win.

122
00:04:20,466 --> 00:04:21,723
And once we get C.A.,

123
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:25,102
you and I can run the
family dynasty together.

124
00:04:32,736 --> 00:04:34,311
(QUIETLY): I can do it tomorrow night.

125
00:04:34,387 --> 00:04:35,737
Jeff won't be at home.

126
00:04:35,814 --> 00:04:38,051
I just need to keep Alexis out
of my hair for a few hours.

127
00:04:38,075 --> 00:04:39,741
I can handle that.

128

(SOOTHING MUSIC PLAYING)

129
00:04:47,659 --> 00:04:48,917
Oh.

130
00:04:48,994 --> 00:04:50,586
That looks... relaxing?

131
00:04:50,662 --> 00:04:51,753
It's cupping.

132
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:54,039
Helps draw toxins out of the system

133
00:04:54,115 --> 00:04:56,258

I can't risk losing my edge.

Before you move on to leeches,

137
00:05:01,173 --> 00:05:04,549
may I remind you that everything
is going according to plan.

00:05:04,626 --> 00:05:06,435
And may I remind you
this is Blake Carrington.

139
00:05:06,512 --> 00:05:08,437
He's not gonna give up
C.A. without a fight.

140
00:05:08,514 --> 00:05:11,002
(QUIETLY): Try not to worry so much.

141
00:05:11,037 --> 00:05:12,774
You might pop a cup.

142
00:05:12,851 --> 00:05:15,777
If Blake were up to something,
we would know about it and...

143
00:05:15,854 --> 00:05:17,229
I would be concerned.

144
00:05:17,305 --> 00:05:21,233

have a care in the world?

party this weekend.

00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,538
stand by for her to leave,

and when she does...
(CLICKS TONGUE) detonate.

155
00:05:36,449 --> 00:05:39,301
It'll look like a faulty gas
tank caused the explosion.

156
00:05:40,047 --> 00:05:41,448
She'll be driving a black SUV,

157
00:05:41,472 --> 00:05:43,305
but I'll text you the specifics.

158
00:05:43,382 --> 00:05:45,340
Got it. This will be our last meeting.

00:05:45,417 --> 00:05:46,808
We can't risk being seen together.

No one knows we're here.

But, actually, there is
someone I need you to avoid.

162
00:05:51,148 --> 00:05:53,181
- Dominique Deveraux.
- What are you talking about?

163
00:05:53,258 --> 00:05:54,516
She followed me the other day.

164
00:05:54,593 --> 00:05:55,984
She thinks you and I
are having an affair.

165
00:05:56,061 --> 00:05:57,297
I would just make sure
she doesn't see you

166
00:05:57,321 --> 00:05:58,330
anywhere near that party.

167
00:05:58,397 --> 00:05:59,404
Just to be safe.

168
00:05:59,431 --> 00:06:01,281
- We're done here.
- Seriously?

169
00:06:01,358 --> 00:06:03,191
W... She's already kind of crazy.

170
00:06:03,268 --> 00:06:05,026
No one would even believe her.

171
00:06:05,103 --> 00:06:07,496
- I-I'll pay you double.
- It's not worth it.

172
00:06:07,573 --> 00:06:09,614
All it takes is one person
picking me out of a lineup

173
00:06:09,691 --> 00:06:11,758
and I spend the rest
of my life in prison.

And then we'll go to dinner?

you could talk to Fallon about it?

Why do, uh, all of your ideas
involve releasing live doves

- Maybe because she's insane?

355
00:12:49,478 --> 00:12:50,686
until Heidi gets back.

356
00:12:50,762 --> 00:12:53,022
I don't know what any
of those words mean.

357
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:55,190
- I'll see you later?
- Okay, that's fine, I guess.

358
00:12:55,267 --> 00:12:56,984
Just let me know when the kid's gone.

359
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:59,036
- Come here.
- Okay.

360
00:13:03,929 --> 00:13:04,992
He canceled on you, right?

361
00:13:05,068 --> 00:13:06,326
- I can read body language.
- Hmm.

362
00:13:06,403 --> 00:13:09,588
Yes, he did.
He has to go babysit Connor.

363
00:13:09,665 --> 00:13:13,092
You know, this kid is really
screwing with my weekend.

364
00:13:13,169 --> 00:13:15,169
You're lucky if it's only one weekend.

365
00:13:15,245 --> 00:13:18,097
He and mini-Liam are
practically inseparable.

366
00:13:18,174 --> 00:13:20,174
You'd better make sure
this kid likes you.

367
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:21,433
Why?

368
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:23,080
If daddy has to choose between

369
00:13:23,104 --> 00:13:24,845
his child and his bride-to-be,

370
00:13:24,922 --> 00:13:26,480
it's really no contest.

You know, when you say it like that,

471

you don't trust me.

being honest with each other.

478
00:17:34,039 --> 00:17:35,947
- We are.
- But you think I didn't need to know

479
00:17:36,024 --> 00:17:38,208
that Jeff is sick and
getting worse every day?

480
00:17:38,285 --> 00:17:40,355
That wasn't my secret to tell.

481
00:17:40,379 --> 00:17:42,357
Especially when you're
the one who poisoned him

482
00:17:42,381 --> 00:17:43,547

483
00:17:43,624 --> 00:17:44,882
I apologized for poisoning him!

484
00:17:44,958 --> 00:17:46,833
And then I recorded that confession!

485
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:49,386
I have proven my loyalty
to you many times over,

486
00:17:49,463 --> 00:17:51,129
and yet, you still treat me like a...

487
00:17:51,206 --> 00:17:53,465

Dominique's antics

drove Monica out of the state,

00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:16,321

wrong and you're trying

to make it up to her. See?

500
00:18:19,734 --> 00:18:21,563
I told you when we were
dating you needed to be more

501
00:18:21,587 --> 00:18:23,662
- communicative.
- Look, I'm being serious, Fallon.

502
00:18:23,738 --> 00:18:25,330
And I thought you were
already gonna sign her.

503
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:27,415
I was, I was, I just, you know,

504
00:18:27,492 --> 00:18:30,013
I wanted to see Dominique beg,
a little, but it's fine.

505
00:18:30,048 --> 00:18:30,743
We can make it official.

506
00:18:30,821 --> 00:18:32,879
Ah, so Vanessa's been
missing out on opportunities

507
00:18:32,956 --> 00:18:34,765
while you were busy being vindictive?

508
00:18:34,842 --> 00:18:36,745
Well, it sounds bad
when you say it like that.

509
00:18:36,769 --> 00:18:40,443
What if... I let her sing
at my engagement party?

510
00:18:40,478 --> 00:18:43,774
- Would that help?
- Ah, so John Mayer backed out, huh?

511
00:18:43,851 --> 00:18:44,975
Oh, he's such a flake.

512
00:18:45,051 --> 00:18:46,610
I hate his stupid, baggy clothes.

513
00:18:46,687 --> 00:18:49,187
(LAUGHS) Vanessa will be thrilled.

514
00:18:49,264 --> 00:18:50,689
Oh, and a word of warning,

515
00:18:50,765 --> 00:18:52,065
steer clear of Dominique.

516
00:18:52,142 --> 00:18:54,451
Hmm, trust me... I know.

517
00:18:55,603 --> 00:18:57,237
I wish she would've just
found fame and fortune

518
00:18:57,314 --> 00:18:58,864
in New York and then stayed there.

519
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:00,532
We all know she didn't move to Atlanta

520
00:19:00,609 --> 00:19:02,534
to be closer to her kids.

521
00:19:02,611 --> 00:19:03,772
You're right.

1054
00:40:40,376 --> 00:40:42,659
As long as the glass is
filled with champagne.

1055
00:40:42,736 --> 00:40:45,190
So, that black outfit you
said you incinerated...

1056
00:40:45,214 --> 00:40:47,526
- (CHUCKLES)
- Did you really?

1057
00:40:47,550 --> 00:40:49,528
- Liam.
- What?

1058
00:40:49,552 --> 00:40:51,135
Hey, buddy.

1059
00:40:52,204 --> 00:40:54,096
Uh, what are you doing here?

1060
00:40:54,173 --> 00:40:55,672
Where's your mom?

1061
00:40:55,749 --> 00:40:58,142
She said to wait for you.

1062
00:41:01,401 --> 00:41:03,939
Why don't you go play some video
games for a little while, buddy, okay?

1063
00:41:06,018 --> 00:41:08,143
Let me see if I can reach her.

1064
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:10,154
Oh, Liam. Liam.

1065
00:41:16,436 --> 00:41:19,079
"Liam, I love my son,

1066
00:41:19,156 --> 00:41:20,489
"but I have sacrificed

1067
00:41:20,565 --> 00:41:22,365
"more than I ever thought to raise him.

1068
00:41:22,442 --> 00:41:26,128
I'm sorry, but it's your turn
to be the parent now."

1069
00:41:29,345 --> 00:41:30,373
"You and Fallon can provide

1070
00:41:30,450 --> 00:41:33,835
"the stable, loving home I never could.

1071
00:41:33,912 --> 00:41:36,847
Please forgive me and
look after our boy."

1072
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:41,103
She's gone.

1073
00:41:41,127 --> 00:41:43,437
(WHISPERS): Well, what are we
supposed to do with him now?

1074
00:41:43,514 --> 00:41:45,055
I...
