Oh, I see.

112
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,555
So if you needed to discuss business
with Adam or Blake,

113
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,438
you would insist that you do it
over dinner.

114
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,670
Well, why not?
Business dinners are quite common.

00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:50,035

- Are quite common.

119
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,189
I see.

120
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,796
I think the key word here, Garrett,
is business.

121
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:58,396
So perhaps if you need to discuss
business with Blake or with Adam

122
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,675
that you do so.

you were a serious businesswoman.

I see I was wrong.

129
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,989
No, I'm a very serious
businesswoman.

130
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,993
I am much too serious
a businesswoman

to mix with romance.

that you are not the kind of man

but really not too good.

It's a little old-fashioned,
it's not very exciting, it's not today.

Let's do something else with this one,

00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,479
Is it wrong?

140
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,517
Yes, Garrett, it is wrong.

00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,998
You see, Garrett, what happened to us
happened a long time ago.

142
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:50,358
Look, what I wanna know
is why you seem so determined

143
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:53,318
to keep pleasure out of your life.

in my record company.

in my power to stop him.

He'll never get away with this.

155
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,151
I'll tell him that.

156
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,030
There's a certain sadness
about you.

157

Something has gone very wrong
in your life.

you would be the last person on earth
that I would tell.

Hi.

How is he?

He's out of surgery

So you thought you'd come home.

No chance of seeing him till tonight.

you told me once that the only reason
that you helped me rescue the king

635
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,830
He needs a base of operations
in order to mount a coup

636
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,355
so that he can regain control
of his country.

637
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:20,199
And since when do you have
a patriotic allegiance to Moldavia?

638
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:23,153
Dex, you've seen the sort of monsters
that are running that country.

639
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:25,715
DEX: There are thugs running
countries all over the world.

640
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,791
That's their business.
It's none of mine.

641
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:31,191
And I am not going to have
our marriage ruined because of it.

642
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:33,630
What does our marriage
have to do with it?

643
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,472
Dex, come and sit down.

644
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:37,392
Sit and let me tell you.

645
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:40,358
Look,
he will have the complete downstairs.

646
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:42,636
Now, he'll have his own
round-the-clock nurses

647
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,074
and we'll be completely separate.

648
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,468
We won't even know he's there.

649
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:49,753
Alexis, how would you feel if I installed
a former lover in our home?

650
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,791
Do you think
you would stand for that?

651
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:53,188
That is completely irrelevant.

652
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:54,395
- Is it?
- Yes.

653
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:55,874
What does this guy have over you

654
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:59,794
that you're so willing to throw me
and our marriage out to move him in?

655
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,197
Why do you always act
as if I have to make a choice?

656
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:06,591
Darling, the thing that's always been
so delicious about our relationship

657
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:09,354
is that we've always allowed
each other our own space.

658
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:11,994
Now, you knew the sort of woman
I was when you married me.

659
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:14,509
So why are you suddenly insisting
on all these ultimatums,

660
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,318
telling me what I can
and cannot do?

661
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:17,919
You haven't answered my question.

662
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:23,910
Galen has made me an offer
that could be worth billions.

663
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:25,712
If it means giving him
temporary shelter,

664
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:28,189
why should you get so upset
about that?

665
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:33,954
I'm sorry that you can't see it, Alexis,
but I am through trying to explain it.

666
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:36,435
Oh, God.

667
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:38,752
Why are you so stubborn, Dex?

668
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:42,117
Why can't you once, just once,
give in?

669
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:47,032
You want it your own way, Alexis?

670
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,838
Well, you can have it.

671
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,879
And you can share it
with His Royal Highness.

672
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:21,871
Now before you go any further,
I want you to close your eyes.

673
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:24,270
Got a surprise for you.

674
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:26,839
Come on.

675
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,319
What is it, Blake? Why can't I see?

676
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:32,074
You will in a minute. Come on.

677
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:42,911
Okay. You can open them up now.

678
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:49,429
Oh.

679
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:51,033
A horse.

680
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:53,472
Well, that's not just any horse.

681
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:55,437
That's Selena, darling.
You remember?

682
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:57,919
Oh, yes.

683
00:42:58,120 --> 00:42:59,838
Selena, this is Mrs. Carrington.

684
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:02,674
Go on, darling. Get to know her.

685
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:04,273
She's yours.

686
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,958
Nice horsey.

687
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:11,997
Come on, girl.

688
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:17,552
What is it, darling? What's wrong?

689
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:18,994
I don't know.

690
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:20,559
Well, you're trembling.

691
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:22,153
I'm sorry.
I don't know what happened.

692
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:23,514
I just got scared.

693
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:25,193
I thought you'd be pleased.

694
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:27,112
Oh, I am, really.

695
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:29,077
It's a lovely gift.

696
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:31,435
It must be this illness.

697
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:35,636
All right, Steve, put her back in.
Thank you.

698
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:41,713
Krystle, what is it? Is it the horse?

699
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:44,030
- Do you want me to take her back?
- No.

700
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:46,555
It's not the horse's fault, it's mine.

701
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:48,278
Oh, can't we just forget about it?

702
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:51,790
No. There's something wrong,
and I wanna get to the bottom of this.

703
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:55,318
I'm just not myself lately.

704
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:57,790
Blake,
I have such a terrible headache.

705
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:59,678
I have to go back to the house
and lie down.

706
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:02,713
You know, that Dr. Travers
isn't doing you one damn bit of good.

707
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:05,715
Blake, please, don't be angry.

708
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:07,273
How can I help but be angry?

709
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:09,795
I'm going to see to it
that you get to another doctor.

710
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,274
You're gonna go to my doctor,

711
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:15,029
and then we're really gonna find out
what's wrong with you once and for all.
