1
00:02:05,249 --> 00:02:07,877
Barbara.
Yes, Mr. Carrington?

2
00:02:07,985 --> 00:02:11,716
Get Mrs. Carrington for me,
will you, please, on her private line?

3
00:02:11,822 --> 00:02:13,790
Yes, sir.

4
00:03:05,442 --> 00:03:07,808
<i>Mr. Carrington.
Yes?</i>

5
00:03:07,912 --> 00:03:11,973
<i>There's no answer.
Mrs. Carrington must be out.</i>

6
00:03:12,082 --> 00:03:15,449
Well, try her for me again
in 20 minutes, will you, please?

7
00:03:15,553 --> 00:03:17,646
<i>Yes, Mr. Carrington.</i>

8
00:03:41,111 --> 00:03:43,011
How does it look?

9
00:03:43,113 --> 00:03:45,274
Dynamite, I think.

10
00:03:45,382 --> 00:03:47,680
<i>Oh,you look wonderful.
Really?</i>

11
00:03:47,785 --> 00:03:50,481
Oh, yeah, it looks great.
Oh, good.

12
00:03:50,588 --> 00:03:53,751
Thanks for making it.
That's what mothers are for.

13
00:03:53,857 --> 00:03:56,758
<i>Listen. I want you to call me
when you get to Tania's tonight.</i>

14
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:59,420
And I want you to call me in the morning
so I know what time to pick you up.

15
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:03,694
Okay.
Daddy's gonna be so proud of you.

16
00:04:03,801 --> 00:04:06,167
Yeah.

17
00:04:18,616 --> 00:04:21,016
Oh, thank you, honey.

18
00:04:21,118 --> 00:04:23,018
Where is she?
Getting dressed.

19
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,213
She looks beautiful.
Just like her mother.

20
00:04:25,322 --> 00:04:29,088
Better. It's nice, isn't it?

21
00:04:29,193 --> 00:04:32,924
Lindsay going out, you and me
being able to be alone tonight.

22
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:37,126
<i>[ Phone Ringing ]
I'll get it. Hello.</i>

23
00:04:37,234 --> 00:04:41,261
Hey, Claudia. Yeah. How you doing?
Good. Matthew around there?

24
00:04:41,372 --> 00:04:44,637
Yeah, sure,just a minute.
It's Walter.

25
00:04:47,211 --> 00:04:50,271
What happened? That old Jeep of yours
conk out and you need a lift?

26
00:04:50,381 --> 00:04:52,849
Not this time, boy.

27
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:57,319
No, unless I've been around this sometimes
filthy, sometimes impossible business...

28
00:04:57,421 --> 00:05:01,585
for over 40 years for nothing,
then we're getting awful close, boy.

29
00:05:01,692 --> 00:05:05,788
We're at 6,5 50 feet and getting
a good show of oil across that shaker.

30
00:05:05,896 --> 00:05:09,388
Maybe you ought
to come on out here.

31
00:05:10,734 --> 00:05:14,067
Did you hear me, boy?
I hear you, Walter.

32
00:05:14,171 --> 00:05:18,767
Well, come on, come on. You want me to send
you your half of the RollsRoyce maybe?

33
00:05:18,876 --> 00:05:22,073
No need for that.
I'm on my way.

34
00:05:22,179 --> 00:05:25,410
She's coming in, Claudia.
He feels pretty damn sure this time.

35
00:05:25,516 --> 00:05:28,417
Oh, Matthew, that's great.
I'll come with you.

36
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:32,148
Well, uh, I'd like you to, but...

37
00:05:32,256 --> 00:05:35,953
<i>well,you can't, honey.
Matthew, I wanna come with you.</i>

38
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,893
I know, but if it does come in...

39
00:05:38,996 --> 00:05:41,794
well, they're gonna be wanting
to go out and celebrate and

40
00:05:41,899 --> 00:05:44,163
<i>Well,you understand, don't ya?</i>

41
00:05:44,268 --> 00:05:47,669
Matthew, I really need
to be with you tonight.

42
00:05:47,771 --> 00:05:50,069
I might be gone three
or four nights...

43
00:05:50,174 --> 00:05:54,008
and I'd like you to,
but you can't, honey.

44
00:05:54,111 --> 00:05:57,569
You just can't.
You know what I feel?

45
00:05:57,681 --> 00:06:00,946
I feel that you care more about that damn well
than you do about a marriage that is

46
00:06:01,051 --> 00:06:05,044
What?
Sinking slowly. Disintegrating.

47
00:06:05,155 --> 00:06:08,989
Don't start on me now.
I mean, not now.

48
00:06:09,093 --> 00:06:13,223
What happens when a well comes in, Matthew?
Does everybody cheer?

49
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:14,991
Yeah, everybody cheers.

50
00:06:15,099 --> 00:06:18,364
And what happens after they cheer?
They celebrate?

51
00:06:18,469 --> 00:06:21,131
If it comes in, yeah.

52
00:06:21,238 --> 00:06:25,299
Who are you planning on
celebrating with, Matthew?
Walter and the boys.

53
00:06:25,409 --> 00:06:27,377
<i>Who were you planning
on celebrating with...</i>

54
00:06:27,478 --> 00:06:30,242
<i>after you celebrate
with Walter and the guys?</i>

55
00:06:35,986 --> 00:06:38,147
What the hell is
that supposed to mean?

56
00:06:38,255 --> 00:06:43,192
Exactly what it sounds like.
Who, Matthew? What's her name? Who?

57
00:06:43,293 --> 00:06:45,761
I don't think I get your meaning.

58
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:50,732
Maybe it's my English. Maybe my English
isn't that good. With whom, Matthew?

59
00:06:50,834 --> 00:06:53,894
Now I'm real excited
and I'm happy.

60
00:06:54,004 --> 00:06:56,063
And this could be
just could be

61
00:06:56,173 --> 00:06:59,700
the happiest and
most important time of my life.

62
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:04,679
<i>Now, are you gonna cut out
all this and at least allow me that?</i>

63
00:07:18,495 --> 00:07:22,898
<i>Mom, I really don't feel so hot.
[ Engine Starts ]</i>

64
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,798
<i>I'd rather not go to some drippy party anyhow.
[ Engine Revs, Tires Screech ]</i>

65
00:07:25,903 --> 00:07:29,737
You heard us.
Part of it.

66
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,936
Now you don't want to go to Tania's?
No.

67
00:07:34,044 --> 00:07:37,172
Come here, baby.
Come on.

68
00:07:37,281 --> 00:07:39,806
Now all married people argue.

69
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:43,353
We do, Tania's parents do.

70
00:07:43,453 --> 00:07:45,887
Everybody who wears
a marriage band argues.

71
00:07:45,989 --> 00:07:48,480
Well, maybe, but...

72
00:07:48,592 --> 00:07:51,755
I don't know
if they argue that heavy.

73
00:07:51,862 --> 00:07:55,798
If all the husbands and men...

74
00:07:55,899 --> 00:07:57,799
walk out like he just did

75
00:07:57,901 --> 00:08:01,735
Lindsay, he's your father.

76
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:03,966
He's the best man I've ever known.

77
00:08:04,074 --> 00:08:07,566
I want you to know that,
and I don't ever want you to forget it.

78
00:08:07,678 --> 00:08:11,136
And if he has to blow
once in a while...

79
00:08:11,248 --> 00:08:14,081
like he said, he's entitled.

80
00:08:16,453 --> 00:08:19,445
Okay. Yeah.

81
00:08:19,556 --> 00:08:22,116
I just don't want
to see you get hurt.

82
00:08:22,226 --> 00:08:25,889
I'm not getting hurt.

83
00:08:25,996 --> 00:08:29,488
And what'll hurt me is if you
don't want to go to this party tonight...

84
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:33,127
and you think you have to stay home
and babysit me that'll hurt me.

85
00:08:33,237 --> 00:08:36,172
Now come on.
You look beautiful.

86
00:08:36,273 --> 00:08:40,209
I want you to go and
have a good time. Hmm?

87
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:44,679
Okay.
Good. Go on.

88
00:08:46,717 --> 00:08:48,685
That's my girl.

89
00:08:51,154 --> 00:08:53,122
Go on.

90
00:09:20,284 --> 00:09:22,343
I'm late. Sorry.

91
00:09:26,423 --> 00:09:31,224
Andy Laird came in. Had some news
about the overseas situation.

92
00:09:31,328 --> 00:09:33,694
It seems that the crisis over there
is lessening somewhat...

93
00:09:33,797 --> 00:09:38,427
and we may be able to get
at least half our oil reserves back.

94
00:09:38,535 --> 00:09:40,503
Good news, huh?

95
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:51,907
Oh.

96
00:09:52,015 --> 00:09:57,078
On the way home, I asked Michael
to stop by at Mr.Jurgen's.

97
00:09:57,187 --> 00:10:01,920
It seems that Mr.Jurgen closes up
that flower shop promptly at 6:00 every night...

98
00:10:02,025 --> 00:10:04,118
and he sits himself
down to dinner...

99
00:10:04,227 --> 00:10:06,923
<i>and nothing's
going to interfere.</i>

100
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:09,555
<i>Why, I was there. It must have been
only four minutes after 6.00.</i>

101
00:10:09,666 --> 00:10:15,366
But you know how stubborn the old fella is.
He just wouldn't open up the place for me.

102
00:10:15,472 --> 00:10:17,440
How about that?

103
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:23,877
<i>But then I told him that
I happened to be married...</i>

104
00:10:23,981 --> 00:10:27,417
<i>to the most beautiful woman
that I'd ever known...</i>

105
00:10:27,517 --> 00:10:29,542
<i>and ever will know.</i>

106
00:10:31,488 --> 00:10:35,720
And that something happened
between us the other day that

107
00:10:35,826 --> 00:10:40,092
Well, something that
I'm very sorry about...

108
00:10:40,197 --> 00:10:43,064
and deeply ashamed of.

109
00:10:44,501 --> 00:10:47,299
<i>Something that I know
hurt her very much and...</i>

110
00:10:47,404 --> 00:10:52,068
<i>something that could have damaged
her faith in me and her love for me.</i>

111
00:10:57,881 --> 00:11:01,009
Well, anyway...

112
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:03,279
Mr.Jurgen finally put down his fork...

113
00:11:03,387 --> 00:11:08,086
and he left the rest of his Rouladen mit
dumplings sitting in the plate...

114
00:11:08,191 --> 00:11:11,092
and he went down and
he opened up the shop for me...

115
00:11:11,194 --> 00:11:13,128
so I could buy these and...

116
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:17,394
tell you how truly
sorry that I was.

117
00:11:24,674 --> 00:11:27,234
Would you open them, please, Krystle?

118
00:11:42,259 --> 00:11:44,454
The old fuchsia routine.

119
00:11:45,695 --> 00:11:47,856
It worked for me once.

120
00:11:53,904 --> 00:11:55,804
Oh, Krystle...

121
00:11:57,841 --> 00:12:01,572
<i>you seem to have the strangest kind
of power over me.</i>

122
00:12:04,981 --> 00:12:09,611
It's just that it's not my nature
to have anyone affect me this way...

123
00:12:09,719 --> 00:12:12,688
to be so close to me.

124
00:12:15,058 --> 00:12:19,392
It's not that I wanted the child
that much; it's just that...

125
00:12:19,496 --> 00:12:22,829
I wanted a part of me...

126
00:12:24,334 --> 00:12:26,996
<i>to live inside you...</i>

127
00:12:27,104 --> 00:12:30,073
to be with you

128
00:12:30,173 --> 00:12:32,733
to be with you after I'm gone.

129
00:12:47,724 --> 00:12:52,286
Oh, Blake,
you're not going anywhere.

130
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:57,056
Maybe,just maybe...

131
00:12:57,167 --> 00:13:00,933
if you loved me,
I could live forever.

132
00:13:30,467 --> 00:13:34,631
<i>[ Walter ] We've been here all night.
I hope something happens soon.</i>

133
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:42,735
What are you thinking?

134
00:13:42,846 --> 00:13:47,374
I'm thinking just what I thought
on my last job and the one before that.

135
00:13:47,484 --> 00:13:49,748
I'm nervous as hell.
How about you?

136
00:13:49,853 --> 00:13:52,788
Same. The same.

137
00:14:24,821 --> 00:14:27,221
Want to dance?

138
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:29,383
No, thanks, Christopher.

139
00:14:29,492 --> 00:14:32,086
Boy, you're really into this.
Why'd you even come tonight anyway?

140
00:14:32,195 --> 00:14:35,221
Because she's my best friend,
and I invited her, turkey.

141
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:38,631
You want to dance?
Later.

142
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:43,238
He's right, you know.

143
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:47,640
You look real cheerful.
I'm not feeling so hot tonight.

144
00:14:47,744 --> 00:14:50,872
Well, don't let my mother,
the hypochondriac, hear it.

145
00:14:50,981 --> 00:14:53,973
She'll figure it's contagious,
and, poof, there'll go the whole party.

146
00:14:55,685 --> 00:14:58,415
<i>Did you call your mom?
Yeah, but she didn't answer.</i>

147
00:14:58,521 --> 00:15:01,149
Oh. She's probably
in the shower or something.

148
00:15:01,258 --> 00:15:04,557
Why don't you go ahead and try again
while I get some more potato chips.

149
00:15:04,661 --> 00:15:09,724
BecauseJohnny Epstein and Christopher
are eating like their fathers went on welfare.

150
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:37,183
Can I have a martini, please?
Martini coming up.

151
00:16:38,788 --> 00:16:41,154
Hi.

152
00:16:41,257 --> 00:16:43,487
Hi.
First time here?

153
00:16:43,593 --> 00:16:45,823
Mmhmm.

154
00:16:45,929 --> 00:16:47,954
Hey, haven't we met
somewhere before?

155
00:16:48,064 --> 00:16:49,793
No.

156
00:16:49,899 --> 00:16:54,666
Hmm. I guess you've never been
to Detroit. Great city.

157
00:16:54,771 --> 00:16:57,103
I keep hearing a lot about it.

158
00:16:57,207 --> 00:17:01,303
Want to hear more,
the real inside stuff?

159
00:17:01,411 --> 00:17:05,245
I mean, about what really
goes on in Grosse Pointe?

160
00:17:05,348 --> 00:17:07,111
Not particularly.

161
00:17:07,217 --> 00:17:10,084
Okay.

162
00:17:20,263 --> 00:17:22,322
You have excellent taste.

164
00:17:26,002 --> 00:17:31,463
A certifiable, bona fide, doubledigit I.Q. creep.
Yeah.

165
00:17:31,574 --> 00:17:35,704
As a matter of fact, that guy is the sovereign
state of Michigan's gift to creepdom.

166
00:17:35,812 --> 00:17:40,579
Now, on the other hand, I am generally
regarded as fairly likable...

reasonably good looking

I'm a whiz at my job.
And very modest.

My name is Lawrence Armstrong, and I'm known
as Larry to my friends, both old and new.

What's your name?
Claudia.

No, please!
Oh, please. Please

175
00:19:24,888 --> 00:19:27,482
Stop.
Hey, ease up.

176
00:19:28,992 --> 00:19:32,928
All right, look. I'm sorry
if I came on a little too fast.

177
00:19:33,029 --> 00:19:36,157
Why don't we go upstairs and have a drink?
No.

178

No?

179
00:19:39,802 --> 00:19:42,430
Claudia, we just spent practically
the whole evening together.

180
00:19:42,539 --> 00:19:45,133
I mean, what was the point
of coming here to my apartment?

181
00:19:45,241 --> 00:19:47,903
Now I thought that we were having
a real good time together...

182
00:19:48,011 --> 00:19:50,002
that we felt something
for each other.

183
00:19:50,113 --> 00:19:54,140
I made a mistake.
I'm married.

184
00:19:55,418 --> 00:19:57,784
So am I. What difference
does that make?

185
00:19:57,887 --> 00:19:59,855
Please. Please.

186
00:19:59,956 --> 00:20:03,448
Hey, what the hell are you,
some kind of a tease?

187

Mind if I come in?

188
00:20:54,644 --> 00:20:58,136
Does it make any difference
if I mind?

Besides, I was kind of bored,
what with Jeff away and all.

Cheap shot, Michael.

to take advantage of the fact.

must be something terrific.

199

What wench?

200
00:21:42,291 --> 00:21:45,749

Well, I understand
that you and ""Oh,Jennifer''...

What, pray tell?

Her accent...

213
00:22:26,436 --> 00:22:29,166

You and Cecil?
A little bit, yeah.

I don't owe you anything.

Well, because if you don't

00:30:04,727 --> 00:30:09,630
Wait till Lenore comes down those stairs
wearing those river pebbles she calls emeralds.

312
00:30:09,732 --> 00:30:14,169
She'll make Fritzie sell the Corniche
and fly to South America for replacements.

313
00:30:23,412 --> 00:30:27,371
You know, I remember
the first time I saw these.

314
00:30:27,483 --> 00:30:29,713
Daddy and I went shopping
before the wedding.

315
00:30:29,818 --> 00:30:32,810
<i>He said he wanted to get you
something really special...</i>

316
00:30:32,922 --> 00:30:36,289
and he wanted me
to help him decide.

317
00:30:36,392 --> 00:30:38,758
Well, I saw these
and I said, ""Right.

318
00:30:38,861 --> 00:30:41,159
They will turn any woman
into a princess.''

319
00:30:41,263 --> 00:30:44,994
You were in Reno when your father
bought me the necklace, Fallon.

320

Was I?
[ Chuckles ]

321
00:30:49,038 --> 00:30:52,565
Oh, yeah. Of course. I must be
confusing it with something else.

322
00:30:52,675 --> 00:30:55,143
<i>Getting old.</i>

323
00:30:55,244 --> 00:30:58,645
Well, I can't take them.

324
00:30:58,747 --> 00:31:03,582
I mean, they're yours, sparkling with
love and sentiment and God knows what.

325
00:31:07,389 --> 00:31:09,482
Is there something you want
to have out with me, Fallon?

326
00:31:09,592 --> 00:31:14,859
Krystle, what a melodramatic question.
Have what out?

327
00:31:14,964 --> 00:31:20,129
<i>If it's that sweet talk I overheard between
you and Matthew, I mean, it was a party.</i>

328
00:31:20,236 --> 00:31:22,727
We, all of us,
say things at parties.

329
00:31:22,838 --> 00:31:28,140
I mean, if I had been quoted after two sips
of champagne. Really, have what out?

330
00:31:30,813 --> 00:31:32,713
Never mind.

331

<i>[ Dr.Jordan ]

332
00:32:21,163 --> 00:32:23,131
Nope.

333
00:32:24,199 --> 00:32:26,724
I like the job.

334
00:32:26,835 --> 00:32:29,895
I mean, I think it's the job
that's saving me

335
00:32:30,005 --> 00:32:31,905
the job and Lindsay.

336
00:32:32,007 --> 00:32:36,671
Lindsay? How?
She likes me, and that makes me feel really good.

337
00:32:36,779 --> 00:32:41,113
So far, so good.
Now about the real rotten.

338
00:32:45,087 --> 00:32:47,078
I went to a singles bar last night.

339
00:32:47,189 --> 00:32:51,626
I got smashed,
and I let this man pick me up.

340
00:32:51,727 --> 00:32:53,991
That's not true.
I picked him up.

341
00:32:54,096 --> 00:32:57,588
Now what is wrong with me?
Am I some kind of an animal? A hooker?

342
00:33:06,175 --> 00:33:08,871
What did Matthew say
when you got home?

343
00:33:08,977 --> 00:33:11,571
Matthew wasn't there.

344
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:15,013
Matthew was at the drill site.
His partner called.

345
00:33:17,086 --> 00:33:19,384
<i>Go on.
I exploded.</i>

346
00:33:19,488 --> 00:33:21,479
Why?
Because I wanted to go with him.

347
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:23,649
I asked him if I could,
and he said no.

348
00:33:25,794 --> 00:33:28,786
What did you feel?
Do you think he was wrong?

349
00:33:28,897 --> 00:33:31,991
Yes, I thought he was wrong.
What do you think now?

350
00:33:32,101 --> 00:33:36,470
Now I think that maybe
I was the one that was wrong.

351
00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:46,807
Now I think that I am concerned about
myself picking up strange men in bars.

352
00:33:46,915 --> 00:33:49,440
I'm concerned about my life.

353
00:33:49,551 --> 00:33:52,349
Am I ever going
to get it together? Ever?

354
00:33:52,454 --> 00:33:54,945
I am concerned about Matthew.

355
00:33:55,057 --> 00:33:57,787
Why can't I even get him
to respond to me?

356
00:33:57,893 --> 00:34:01,260
Sexually? Still?
Yes, sexually still.

357
00:34:01,363 --> 00:34:04,992
Emotionally. Verbally.
Name it.

358
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:09,503
And that is why you picked up a man,
and you had a fight with your husband...

359
00:34:09,605 --> 00:34:12,631
and you are sitting here now, fighting
back the tears which you refuse to let out.

360
00:34:15,544 --> 00:34:18,479
It's Matthew you're angry with, isn't it?

361
00:34:21,183 --> 00:34:24,448
<i>You've been hinting for sometime
now about another woman.</i>

362
00:34:24,553 --> 00:34:27,386
Are you gonna talk about that,
or we gonna pretend it doesn't exist?

363
00:34:34,763 --> 00:34:36,856
His exboss's wife.

364
00:34:36,965 --> 00:34:39,297
I'm not interested in who.

365
00:34:39,401 --> 00:34:42,393
I'm interested in whether or not
you've confronted Matthew with this yet.

366
00:34:42,504 --> 00:34:45,496
<i>How do you know it's true?</i>

367
00:34:45,607 --> 00:34:50,704
Have you talked about it with him,
given him a chance to at least defend himself?

368
00:34:50,813 --> 00:34:53,145
No, I haven't.

369
00:34:54,183 --> 00:34:56,947
I don't have to.

370
00:34:57,052 --> 00:34:59,520
Because in my heart...

371
00:34:59,621 --> 00:35:02,590
I know he loves her...

372
00:35:02,691 --> 00:35:05,216
not me.

373
00:35:48,303 --> 00:35:50,294
Hello, Claudia.

Mrs. Carrington.

375
00:35:54,843 --> 00:35:58,301
Call me Krystle.
How's your family?

376
00:35:58,413 --> 00:36:00,472
Matthew's fine.

377
00:36:02,184 --> 00:36:04,709
He's at the drill site
waiting for good news.

378
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:07,084
That's great.

379
00:36:12,828 --> 00:36:16,992
Do you come here often?
I used to.

380
00:36:17,099 --> 00:36:20,694
Hmm. I never used to.

381
00:36:20,802 --> 00:36:23,828
But I'm beginning
to appreciate new things.

382
00:36:25,474 --> 00:36:30,434
How wonderful to have
that gift, that that talent.

383
00:36:30,546 --> 00:36:34,880
There are all kinds of talents,
Mrs. Carrington.

384
00:36:36,585 --> 00:36:39,520
There's the talent
of being beautiful...

385
00:36:39,621 --> 00:36:43,182
<i>and getting any man that
you want to fall in love with you.</i>

<i>There's the talent of getting
what you want out oflife.</i>

387

<i>Now that's a true talent,
isn't it?</i>

388
00:36:48,397 --> 00:36:53,528
Sorry. I hope that doesn't sound
like a strange question coming
from someone with my background.

389
00:36:56,872 --> 00:37:00,774
Your past is past, Claudia.
It could happen to any of us.

390
00:37:00,876 --> 00:37:04,107
Don't you be nice to me,
because I'm not here to be nice to you.

391
00:37:04,212 --> 00:37:08,672
I'm not here by accident, either.
I called your house to see where you were.

392

You see...

393
00:37:10,986 --> 00:37:15,013
I think that you and my husband slept together
when I was in the hospital.

394
00:37:22,664 --> 00:37:24,894
Have you asked Matthew about this?

395
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,161
I'm asking you.

396
00:37:31,306 --> 00:37:33,638
That's very unfair, Claudia.

397
00:37:35,010 --> 00:37:39,640
Matthew's your husband.
I'm nothing to you.

Yeah, we do, boy. We do.

No, I just know how much
he'd like to have you with him.

You need me here.
To do what?

408
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:54,444
Well, brush off
and polish your boots.

I loathe the Meurice.

Do you know they used it
for Nazi headquarters during the war?

Suppose I found myself sleeping
in Field Marshal Goering's favorite room?

I tell you, if it comes to a showdown
between you and Goering's ghost...

00:43:23,191 --> 00:43:25,921
That's us!
Ha!

462
00:44:12,841 --> 00:44:16,004
<i>Where's your mother? I didn't see the car.
She's out.</i>

463
00:44:16,111 --> 00:44:19,638
Where?
I don't know. She phoned.

464
00:44:19,748 --> 00:44:22,774
She said that she might
be out for a while.

465
00:44:22,884 --> 00:44:26,342
She told me to go back to Tania's
if you got too late.

466
00:44:29,557 --> 00:44:31,320
Hmm.

467
00:44:31,426 --> 00:44:35,192
Well, guess what.

468
00:44:36,865 --> 00:44:40,824
I got some good news.
The well came in.

469
00:44:40,935 --> 00:44:43,426
That's good.

470
00:44:49,210 --> 00:44:51,508
I thought I might
bring you a little present.

471
00:44:51,613 --> 00:44:55,310
I kind of think you're partial
to chocolatecovered Brazils.

472
00:44:55,417 --> 00:44:57,612
I am. Thank you.
You're welcome.

473
00:44:57,719 --> 00:45:02,088
I got this for Mom.
It's a Beatles album she always liked.

474
00:45:02,190 --> 00:45:05,455
In fact, it's the first song
we heard when we first met.

475
00:45:15,537 --> 00:45:17,562
Well, honey,
you can do that later.

476
00:45:17,672 --> 00:45:20,300
[ Sharply ]
I want to do it now.

477
00:45:21,776 --> 00:45:24,540
Hey. Come here.

478
00:45:32,454 --> 00:45:34,513
Okay.

479
00:45:34,622 --> 00:45:36,886
Unload on your old man.
What is it?

480
00:45:37,025 --> 00:45:39,619
Nothing.

481
00:45:39,727 --> 00:45:42,457
Problem at school?

482
00:45:42,564 --> 00:45:44,759
Yeah.

483
00:45:44,866 --> 00:45:48,632
Sometimes I feel bad about
dropping out of the play...

484
00:45:48,736 --> 00:45:52,672
after Mom finished making the costume
and everything.

485
00:45:58,046 --> 00:46:01,607
Lindsay, you're talking
to your father now.

486
00:46:03,518 --> 00:46:06,009
What is it?

487
00:46:13,795 --> 00:46:16,525
Am I a bastard?

488
00:46:16,631 --> 00:46:20,226
Hey, hey, hey.
What kind of a question is that?

489
00:46:20,335 --> 00:46:22,428
Well, that's what
you call them, isn't it?

490
00:46:22,537 --> 00:46:25,062
People who are born when
their parents aren't married?

491
00:46:25,173 --> 00:46:27,539
Lindsay, where'd you ever
get such a notion?

492
00:46:29,310 --> 00:46:31,835
I looked up your marriage license.

493
00:46:33,248 --> 00:46:36,547
I see.

494
00:46:36,651 --> 00:46:42,248
I went to the hall of records,
or whatever you call it, and I looked it up.

495
00:46:44,425 --> 00:46:48,054
Well, you listen to me very carefully.

496
00:46:49,497 --> 00:46:54,196
<i>Your mother and I,
we were young, and we were kids...</i>

497
00:46:54,302 --> 00:46:57,738
but we loved each other very much.

498
00:47:00,308 --> 00:47:02,606
So...

499
00:47:02,710 --> 00:47:06,271
by having it happen before
it should have happened...

500
00:47:06,381 --> 00:47:08,679
doesn't mean anything.

501
00:47:08,783 --> 00:47:14,050
It just means that
we both love you that much more.

502
00:47:15,623 --> 00:47:19,753
You say that you loved Mom
when it happened.

503
00:47:19,861 --> 00:47:22,159
Yes.

504
00:47:22,263 --> 00:47:25,255
Do you love her now?

505
00:47:25,366 --> 00:47:29,393
I mean, more than anything
in the whole world, including me?

506
00:47:29,504 --> 00:47:32,735
Well, sure I do, honey,
but I love you in a different way.

507
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:38,369
Do you love her
more than anything...

508
00:47:38,479 --> 00:47:41,937
in the whole world, period?

509
00:47:42,050 --> 00:47:44,678
Yes.

510
00:47:47,755 --> 00:47:50,155
I don't think so, Daddy.

511
00:47:57,365 --> 00:48:00,664
I'm glad about your well.

512
00:48:16,751 --> 00:48:19,515
What did Krystle say?

513
00:48:19,621 --> 00:48:22,522
She said ask your husband.

514
00:48:22,624 --> 00:48:24,819
Did you?

515
00:48:24,926 --> 00:48:28,885
Don't you see? By her saying nothing,
she was saying it was true.

516
00:48:30,632 --> 00:48:32,930
Here. Here's some wine.

517
00:48:35,903 --> 00:48:38,269
I understand that.

518
00:48:38,373 --> 00:48:41,831
But I don't understand
why you didn't ask Matthew.

519
00:48:46,114 --> 00:48:48,082
I just didn't.

520
00:48:49,550 --> 00:48:52,018
He's at the drill site.
The well came in.

521
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:55,089
I know that.

522
00:48:55,189 --> 00:49:00,217
But I don't think that's really
the reason, Claudia. I mean, is it?

523
00:49:01,996 --> 00:49:06,592
You can tell me. It's okay.
I mean, all you have to do is just say it.

524
00:49:08,736 --> 00:49:11,830
I just guess...

525
00:49:11,939 --> 00:49:14,305
I didn't wanna ask him.

526
00:49:15,576 --> 00:49:19,842
I didn't wanna hear him say it.

527
00:49:19,947 --> 00:49:24,680
Oh, I just don't want
to feel hurt anymore.

528
00:49:24,786 --> 00:49:26,720
Am I wrong?

529
00:49:28,423 --> 00:49:31,756
No, you're not wrong.

530
00:49:31,859 --> 00:49:36,626
Wrong is when you hurt somebody.
That's the only wrong I know.

531
00:49:36,731 --> 00:49:39,427
I don't even know
what I'm doing here.

532
00:49:39,534 --> 00:49:42,731
You didn't even ask me here.
Why don't you just say it to me?

533
00:49:42,837 --> 00:49:46,295
Say, ""Claudia, leave.''
Steven, say it.

534
00:49:46,407 --> 00:49:49,899
Because I don't want you to leave.

535
00:49:52,914 --> 00:49:55,144
I want you to stay here.

536
00:50:03,324 --> 00:50:05,258
Hold me.

537
00:50:20,541 --> 00:50:23,510
Do you know how important
this night is to me, Claudia?

538
00:50:27,048 --> 00:50:29,448
You see, I, uh

539
00:50:29,550 --> 00:50:31,950
I've never really been
with a woman before.

540
00:50:35,356 --> 00:50:39,952
And I guess, uh,
that's why I wonder

541
00:50:40,061 --> 00:50:43,225
You don't have to wonder, Steven.

542
00:50:45,633 --> 00:50:48,932
There's a beautiful gentleness
about you.

543
00:50:52,407 --> 00:50:55,701
A tenderness
that transcends gender.

544
00:50:57,678 --> 00:51:01,008
That's something
you're never gonna lose...

545
00:51:01,549 --> 00:51:05,118
no matter what happens
after tonight.
