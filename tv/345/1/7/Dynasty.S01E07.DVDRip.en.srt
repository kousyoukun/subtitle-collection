1
00:03:12,783 --> 00:03:15,115
Boy, this is sure exhausting.

2
00:03:15,219 --> 00:03:18,416
I haven't sweat this much
in years.

3
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:25,394
<i>[ Chuckles ]
Oh.</i>

4
00:03:25,496 --> 00:03:27,430
Sorry about that, darling.
[ Chuckling ]

5
00:03:27,531 --> 00:03:32,127
That's okay. Next time I'll show you.
I'll make you grovel in defeat.

6
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:35,866
Have fun?
Yeah. Lots.

7
00:03:35,973 --> 00:03:38,134
<i>[ Blake ]
How about a little lemonade?</i>

8
00:03:38,242 --> 00:03:40,836
Yeah!
Love some.

9
00:03:42,513 --> 00:03:45,448
Okay. You want to
tell him, or should I?

10
00:03:45,549 --> 00:03:47,449
I'll tell him.

11
00:03:47,551 --> 00:03:50,645
Daddy,Jeff and I are gonna live here for a while.
If it's all right, Blake.

12
00:03:50,754 --> 00:03:52,654
Well, of course it is.

13
00:03:52,756 --> 00:03:54,986
What father of what indigent daughter
and soninlaw...

14
00:03:55,092 --> 00:03:57,083
wouldn't allow them
to come in out of the snow?

15
00:03:58,662 --> 00:04:01,392
What do you think, darling?
This is a democracy, you know.

16
00:04:01,498 --> 00:04:04,467
Of course.
Then it's unanimous.

17
00:04:04,568 --> 00:04:07,298
Jeff has to be off playing
traveling man some of the time.

18
00:04:07,404 --> 00:04:10,373
I've loved this shack
ever since I can remember.

19
00:04:10,474 --> 00:04:13,204
Well,just sign the lease.
Right here.

20
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:16,802
Appreciate it, Blake.
Just for a while. Krystle, thanks.

21
00:04:16,914 --> 00:04:19,747
Fallon, you know we'd love you
to stay with us.

22
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:33,631
I've gotta get going.
I gotta meet Ed and fix that damn winch again.

23
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:39,001
I've gotta get going.
I gotta meet Ed and fix that damn winch again.

24
00:04:39,103 --> 00:04:42,197
I ran into his wife yesterday
at the market.

25
00:04:42,306 --> 00:04:44,866
You did?
Mmhmm.

26
00:04:44,975 --> 00:04:48,809
She told me about that fight that you had
with him over Steven Carrington.

27
00:04:48,912 --> 00:04:51,278
Didn't I mention that?

28
00:04:51,382 --> 00:04:53,316
No.

29
00:04:53,417 --> 00:04:55,385
She told me something else
you didn't mention.

30
00:04:55,486 --> 00:04:56,783
What?

31
00:04:56,887 --> 00:04:58,878
Steven Carrington's gay.

32
00:04:58,989 --> 00:05:01,321
She say that?

33
00:05:01,425 --> 00:05:03,723
No. Fruit.

34
00:05:03,827 --> 00:05:06,352
I think she said
he's... a fruit.

35
00:05:09,033 --> 00:05:11,797
Well, that sounds
like Nell and Ed.

36
00:05:12,903 --> 00:05:15,133
That sort of talk
disgusts me.

37
00:05:15,239 --> 00:05:17,707
People have a right
to be what they want to be.

38
00:05:19,009 --> 00:05:21,170
Honey...

39
00:05:21,278 --> 00:05:23,803
I tried to
explain that to him.

40
00:05:31,355 --> 00:05:33,880
You sure it's okay
if I bring him over this afternoon?

41
00:05:33,991 --> 00:05:36,050
Sure I'm sure. What's his name?
Christopher.

42
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,926
Is he a hunk?
Oh, yeah. Well, he's sort of cute.

43
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:43,625
You gonna take the car out?
You gotta keep trying, gotta keep doing it.

44
00:05:43,734 --> 00:05:45,827
I don't know. I, um
I might take the bus.

45
00:05:45,936 --> 00:05:48,336
You know, energy crisis,
all that.

46
00:05:49,373 --> 00:05:52,570
Go make oil.
As much as I can.

47
00:06:24,641 --> 00:06:27,940
See you tonight?
Maybe take in a movie after dinner?

48
00:06:28,045 --> 00:06:31,913
Oh, I hate plans,Jeff.
I also hate Daddy's projection room.

49
00:06:32,015 --> 00:06:34,848
Well, what I had
in mind is we could, uh...

50
00:06:34,952 --> 00:06:38,046
take a drive into town,
go to a theater and...

51
00:06:38,155 --> 00:06:40,055
maybe neck in the balcony.

52
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,193
Well, why didn't you say so?

53
00:06:52,069 --> 00:06:54,765
We'll see, okay?

54
00:06:56,607 --> 00:06:58,507
Michael.

55
00:06:58,609 --> 00:07:00,577
Thanks.

56
00:07:01,945 --> 00:07:03,845
What's
the money for?

57
00:07:03,947 --> 00:07:05,847
The work you did
to my car.

58
00:07:05,949 --> 00:07:08,042
Took me
20 minutes.

59
00:07:08,152 --> 00:07:10,552
Well, you didn't
have to do it at all.

60
00:07:10,654 --> 00:07:14,681
I know. But the Carringtons give me
just about everything I need.

61
00:07:37,147 --> 00:07:39,308
[ Engine Starts ]

62
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:17,819
Get out.

63
00:08:26,363 --> 00:08:29,093
Want to walk?
No.

64
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:30,689
I do.

65
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:58,556
So, how is he
your groom?

66
00:08:58,662 --> 00:09:02,257
Ravishingly handsome,
in case you haven't noticed.

67
00:09:02,366 --> 00:09:04,561
That's with the lights on.

68
00:09:05,903 --> 00:09:08,235
He's very gentle.

69
00:09:08,338 --> 00:09:12,434
Just the way you like it
about once every two months.

70
00:09:12,542 --> 00:09:14,476
You know what
I'd like to do?

71
00:09:14,578 --> 00:09:16,876
Kick you
where it really hurts.

72
00:09:24,454 --> 00:09:27,048
Hey. Come on.

73
00:09:27,157 --> 00:09:29,557
I think I'm entitled
to a few minutes with you.

74
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:33,653
Entitled?
You're entitled to that dumb uniform...

75
00:09:33,764 --> 00:09:36,733
and whatever my father
pays you to drive.

76
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:38,801
Well, I used to be entitled

77
00:09:38,902 --> 00:09:41,735
That's right.
You said it. Past tense.

78
00:09:41,838 --> 00:09:45,797
You tell that to those football jocks
your father pays too?

79
00:09:45,909 --> 00:09:50,346
What'd you do? Take out an ad in the locker room
rag sheet? No more ""entitled''?

80
00:09:52,082 --> 00:09:54,744
You want trouble, friend,
you're sure as hell gonna get it.

81
00:09:54,851 --> 00:09:58,287
What I want is you, Fallon.

82
00:09:59,856 --> 00:10:01,756
You missed me?

83
00:10:04,628 --> 00:10:06,528
You'd be surprised how much.

84
00:10:07,831 --> 00:10:09,799
Spare me.

85
00:10:11,001 --> 00:10:13,162
When I was a little kid,
we were pretty poor.

86
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:18,936
And when my mother used to ask me,
""How much do you love me?''

87
00:10:19,042 --> 00:10:21,203
I'd say, ""A million dollars.''

88
00:10:22,679 --> 00:10:25,614
When she had to go to
my grandmother's back east...

89
00:10:25,716 --> 00:10:30,119
and she'd come home, and she'd ask,
""How much did you miss me?''

90
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:32,814
I'd say, ""A million dollars.''

91
00:10:35,726 --> 00:10:38,058
That's how much
I've missed you.

92
00:10:39,296 --> 00:10:41,264
I am married.

93
00:10:42,466 --> 00:10:44,627
So is half the world.

94
00:10:45,669 --> 00:10:48,263
I don't intend
to cheat on him.

95
00:10:50,273 --> 00:10:52,241
Yet.

96
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:06,248
Why'd you marry him?

97
00:11:06,356 --> 00:11:08,586
That's my business.

98
00:11:08,692 --> 00:11:10,592
He's a jerk,
and you know it.

99
00:11:10,694 --> 00:11:13,822
Offering me bucks
a tip.

100
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:18,594
That's the world he comes from.
The world I come from.

101
00:11:18,702 --> 00:11:20,602
We're generous to servants.

102
00:11:20,704 --> 00:11:23,605
Well, your father seems to have
different ideas about me.

103
00:11:23,707 --> 00:11:26,505
I got a raise.

104
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:30,171
He says I'll be out of
this dumb uniform in a while.

105
00:11:31,948 --> 00:11:34,348
Why did you marry him, Fallon?

106
00:11:34,451 --> 00:11:36,351
Honest answer.

107
00:11:36,453 --> 00:11:40,321
Well, for one thing,
I want to own

108
00:11:40,424 --> 00:11:42,551
<i>run ColbyCo Oil.</i>

109
00:11:42,659 --> 00:11:44,627
Honest enough for you?

110
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:51,299
Then you swiped the orchid
out of the wrong hothouse.

111
00:11:51,401 --> 00:11:53,665
Cecil Colby.

112
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:56,204
You sure had a chance
to make it with him.

113
00:11:56,306 --> 00:11:59,742
You think you know
a lot, don't you?

114
00:11:59,843 --> 00:12:03,779
Are you gonna take me back to town,
or do I drive that hearse myself?

115
00:12:05,182 --> 00:12:07,150
My pleasure.

116
00:12:22,265 --> 00:12:26,702
I just found a note from
an obviously beautiful woman on my bed.

117
00:12:26,803 --> 00:12:28,703
Hmm. The woman or the note?

118
00:12:28,805 --> 00:12:30,705
Sad to say the note.

119
00:12:30,807 --> 00:12:34,504
Pretty sexy stuff too.
Said ""Meet me in the kitchen. Urgent.''

120
00:12:34,611 --> 00:12:36,704
Oh. Well...

121
00:12:36,813 --> 00:12:38,747
here we are.

122
00:12:38,849 --> 00:12:42,046
I don't understand.
Where is everybody? Where's the staff?

123
00:12:42,152 --> 00:12:44,313
Sent them packing.
Gave them the day off.

124
00:12:44,421 --> 00:12:46,651
Do you mean
that we're alone?

125
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:50,787
Well, I am the mistress
of the house.

126
00:12:50,894 --> 00:12:52,794
That's what the man said.
Didn't he?

127
00:12:52,896 --> 00:12:54,420
Mmhmm.

128
00:12:55,632 --> 00:12:57,998
So, how would he like
his Spanish omelet?

129
00:12:58,101 --> 00:13:00,069
Very Spanish.

130
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:02,070
Hmm. Lots and lots
of hot stuff?

131
00:13:02,172 --> 00:13:05,869
Oh, yes.
Lots and lots of hot stuff.

132
00:13:08,011 --> 00:13:11,947
Mrs. Carrington,
I love you.

133
00:13:12,048 --> 00:13:14,016
And I love you.

134
00:13:17,554 --> 00:13:20,022
Especially
Especially what?

135
00:13:21,424 --> 00:13:23,858
On a day like today.

136
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:28,260
When those lines up there
don't look quite so tight.

137
00:13:28,365 --> 00:13:30,697
When you can yell out
to the rest of the world...

138
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,291
""Hey, I'm taking the day off,
and I'm gonna be with my wife.''

139
00:13:33,403 --> 00:13:35,462
I feel so relaxed
when I'm with you.

140
00:13:35,572 --> 00:13:38,905
Oh, and I'm happy
just to see you that way.

141
00:13:39,009 --> 00:13:42,001
Like I'm happy
I've got everything I've ever dreamed of.

142
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,339
Ah. Back to work.

143
00:13:47,384 --> 00:13:49,909
And then,
I'd like to talk.

144
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:51,988
About what?

145
00:13:53,757 --> 00:13:55,884
Well, about us.

146
00:13:57,561 --> 00:14:01,861
I love being with you,
and I want to be with you more

147
00:14:01,965 --> 00:14:04,058
be more involved
in your life...

148
00:14:04,167 --> 00:14:06,362
in your work.

149
00:14:06,469 --> 00:14:10,462
I used to be a pretty good secretary.
I helped whenever I could.

150
00:14:10,574 --> 00:14:13,270
I'd like to help again.

151
00:14:14,844 --> 00:14:17,813
[ Sighs ]
Guess I've talked. End of speech.

152
00:14:17,914 --> 00:14:20,474
I think that might
be arranged.

153
00:14:21,918 --> 00:14:25,183
You know, there's something
that I want from you too.

154
00:14:25,288 --> 00:14:27,222
Just as seriously.

155
00:14:28,258 --> 00:14:30,226
I want a child by you.

156
00:14:32,195 --> 00:14:35,631
And soon.
Very soon.

157
00:14:35,732 --> 00:14:37,893
Because, you know...

158
00:14:38,001 --> 00:14:40,799
neither one of us

No offense, Michael.

I mean, I'd love
the next dance, love.

you wanted to talk about.

255
00:21:17,533 --> 00:21:20,593
We talked about it before.

256
00:21:25,208 --> 00:21:28,735
How I used to think when I was
in the hospital that Matthew was...

257
00:21:30,146 --> 00:21:32,740
probably with other women.

258
00:21:34,484 --> 00:21:38,352
And how I used to lie
in my room and, um...

259
00:21:39,889 --> 00:21:42,722
sometimes at night I'd think about it,
and I'd be

260
00:21:46,562 --> 00:21:48,530
Angry?

261
00:21:51,501 --> 00:21:53,469
Very.

262
00:21:56,339 --> 00:22:00,708
But in my heart,
I always knew that it was, um...

263
00:22:02,211 --> 00:22:04,179
just a need.

264
00:22:06,249 --> 00:22:08,217
Matthew's need.

265
00:22:10,219 --> 00:22:13,518
So I became less sad,
and, um...

266
00:22:13,623 --> 00:22:16,592
more and more, they became

267
00:22:16,693 --> 00:22:19,321
these women

268
00:22:19,429 --> 00:22:21,590
my husband's
faceless needs.

269
00:22:24,067 --> 00:22:26,467
They were faceless to me.

270
00:22:26,569 --> 00:22:30,699
Then one night last week, I had
a terrible feeling I was meeting one of them.

271
00:22:34,043 --> 00:22:35,943
Where?

272
00:22:36,045 --> 00:22:37,945
The butcher's?
The baker's?

273
00:22:38,047 --> 00:22:39,947
Outside of
Lucy Sorella's brothel?

274
00:22:40,049 --> 00:22:43,815
I'm sorry. I didn't realize
this was supposed to be funny.

275
00:22:46,055 --> 00:22:48,319
What's not funny is when
you won't let it out.

276
00:22:50,259 --> 00:22:53,524
You've got something
to talk about. Talk.

277
00:22:56,532 --> 00:23:00,628
It was at a dinner party.
She was the hostess.

work for.

Very beautiful.
Beautiful eyes.

281
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:16,444
Except when they looked at mine,
they looked away.

282
00:23:28,331 --> 00:23:28,431
""They call me Katharine
that do talk of me.''

283
00:23:28,466 --> 00:23:31,628
""They call me Katharine
that do talk of me.''

284
00:23:31,734 --> 00:23:35,329
You lie, in faith,
for you are plain Kate...

00:23:37,473 --> 00:23:40,772
and bonny Kate,
the prettiest Kate in Christendom.

287
00:23:42,011 --> 00:23:45,105
And therefore, Kate,
take this of me...

288
00:23:45,214 --> 00:23:47,546
Kate of my constellation.

289
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:50,244
That's consolation.
Is it?

00:23:50,353 --> 00:23:52,287
Oh, yeah.

291
00:23:52,388 --> 00:23:55,016
Who cares?
We have been at it pretty long.

Come on. Why don't you leave him alone?
Oh, I don't wanna hurt him.

309

fly off of the top of that rig.

We like the work
you've been doing.

313

Thanks.
Guess I should've mentioned it.

314
00:26:54,770 --> 00:26:59,264
Been so damn busy
and things going on around here.

00:26:59,375 --> 00:27:01,775
Yeah, I know.

we'd like to have you out
to the house tonight for dinner.

319
00:27:13,823 --> 00:27:16,792
What is this, Blaisdel?
Be kind to a faggot week?

320
00:27:20,763 --> 00:27:22,731
Forget it.

321
00:27:25,234 --> 00:27:27,202
Matthew.

322
00:27:30,873 --> 00:27:34,741
I'm sorry.
I'll be there. And thanks.

323
00:27:34,844 --> 00:27:37,244
<i>Tell your wife that I
I look forward to seeing her again.</i>

324
00:27:37,346 --> 00:27:39,177
We had a very nice talk
last time.

325
00:27:41,617 --> 00:27:43,812
Yeah. She told me about it.
The hospital.

326
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:45,910
How you understood.
And I appreciate that.

327
00:27:46,022 --> 00:27:49,480
Well, it was a pretty good evening
all the way around.

328
00:27:49,592 --> 00:27:53,119
You know, I was especially proud
of Krystle the way she handled things.

329
00:27:53,229 --> 00:27:56,198
Her first big
Carrington social event.

330
00:27:58,701 --> 00:28:02,102
Yeah. She did fine.

331
00:28:05,474 --> 00:28:08,910
Well, we eat around 6:30.

332
00:28:38,908 --> 00:28:41,206
Lindsay.

333
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:43,972
Lindsay.

334
00:28:47,216 --> 00:28:51,312
It's Claudia. She sounds a little upset,
and I thought you'd better talk to her.

335
00:28:54,657 --> 00:28:57,217
Claudia?
Matthew.

336
00:28:57,326 --> 00:29:00,727
I don't know what's happening.
Lindsay's gone, and so is the car.

337
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:02,730
Well,just take it easy.

338
00:29:02,832 --> 00:29:06,029
Uh, I'm on my way home
right now.

339
00:29:06,135 --> 00:29:08,103
I'm leaving right now.

340
00:29:09,205 --> 00:29:11,173
It's Lindsay.
She's gone.

341
00:29:32,695 --> 00:29:34,754
Mr. Carrington,
I don't mean to bother you.

342
00:29:34,864 --> 00:29:37,094
That's quite all right.
What is it?

343
00:29:39,835 --> 00:29:41,894
It's about Fallon.

344
00:29:42,004 --> 00:29:45,235
What about Fallon? There hasn't been
an accident? She's all right?

345
00:29:45,341 --> 00:29:48,777
No, sir. No accident.

346
00:29:48,878 --> 00:29:52,245
Well, then, what is it?
What did you want to talk to me about?

347
00:29:52,348 --> 00:29:54,782
Sir, I

348
00:29:54,884 --> 00:29:56,909
I know how important
Fallon is to you.

349
00:29:57,019 --> 00:29:59,749
Yes, yes.

350
00:29:59,855 --> 00:30:01,846
Well, I I don't know
how to say this.

351
00:30:01,957 --> 00:30:03,948
You don't know
how to say what, Michael?

352
00:30:06,929 --> 00:30:09,489
It's about Cecil Colby.

353
00:30:09,598 --> 00:30:12,728
He's been using his money
to keep you going.

354
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:16,170
And?

355
00:30:18,974 --> 00:30:21,306
There was a deal made.

356
00:30:21,410 --> 00:30:24,902
A deal? What kind of a deal?
What are you talking about?

357
00:30:25,014 --> 00:30:26,914
Maybe I've said enough.

358
00:30:27,016 --> 00:30:29,109
No, now wait a minute.

359
00:30:29,218 --> 00:30:31,186
What deal?

360
00:30:35,624 --> 00:30:40,118
Fallon agreed to marry
Cecil Colby's nephew Jeff.

361
00:30:40,229 --> 00:30:44,063
In exchange, Colby would
bail you out financially.

362
00:30:47,603 --> 00:30:49,503
You're lying.

363
00:30:55,644 --> 00:30:57,578
Yes, sir.

364
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:00,080
If that's what
you want to believe.

365
00:31:03,552 --> 00:31:05,713
And how did you
find out about this?

366
00:31:05,821 --> 00:31:09,723
I can't say,
Mr. Carrington...

367
00:31:09,825 --> 00:31:11,759
but I thought
you should know.

368
00:31:40,756 --> 00:31:42,690
She's right here, Claudia.

369
00:31:42,791 --> 00:31:44,759
Yeah. She's all right.
She's all right.

370
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:47,852
How else is she gonna be
when she's with her Uncle Walter?

371
00:31:50,199 --> 00:31:52,167
All right.

372
00:31:55,537 --> 00:31:59,098
Mom and Dad are
on their way over here.

373
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:02,075
Now, you know what
I would do if I were them?

374
00:32:03,646 --> 00:32:06,206
The minute I saw you, I'd

375
00:32:06,315 --> 00:32:09,011
Well, I'd grab and hug you
and kiss you.

376
00:32:09,118 --> 00:32:11,211
And then I'd give you
one he

377
00:32:13,422 --> 00:32:15,617
I'd give you
one good thrashin'.

378
00:32:17,426 --> 00:32:21,419
You're too young to drive.
You're only 1 4, going on eight.

379
00:32:21,530 --> 00:32:23,430
You taught me.

380
00:32:23,532 --> 00:32:26,057
Well, maybe that was
my mistake.

381
00:32:27,169 --> 00:32:29,535
Then there was that bull
about your...

382
00:32:29,638 --> 00:32:31,606
""Can I inherit
what my mom had?''

383
00:32:31,707 --> 00:32:34,175
No. You got hemophilia?

384
00:32:36,445 --> 00:32:39,676
<i>No. I've seen you
cut and scrape yourself a hundred times.</i>

385
00:32:39,782 --> 00:32:41,716
Now you can inherit
hemophilia...

386
00:32:41,817 --> 00:32:43,717
but you can't inherit
a nervous breakdown.

387
00:32:43,819 --> 00:32:47,687
That's what your mother had.
And I say ""had'' because she's recovering now.

388
00:32:49,391 --> 00:32:51,359
I just think you ought to...

389
00:32:52,461 --> 00:32:54,554
talk these things
over with your mom.

390
00:32:57,266 --> 00:32:59,166
Oh...

391
00:32:59,268 --> 00:33:02,032
I can't talk to her.

392
00:33:02,137 --> 00:33:04,537
She wouldn't understand.

393
00:33:07,509 --> 00:33:09,409
Try her.

394
00:33:16,952 --> 00:33:19,977
Now I gotta go
try to find some oil.

395
00:33:51,019 --> 00:33:54,546
Are you all right? Huh?
Lindsay.

396
00:33:54,656 --> 00:33:58,422
What happened? Something must have happened
to make you do something like this.

397
00:34:01,964 --> 00:34:04,296
I don't want to
talk about it.

398
00:34:04,433 --> 00:34:07,266
Hey, Lindsay.

399
00:34:07,369 --> 00:34:11,601
Did you know that you worried me
and your mother half to death?

400

Did you know that?

401
00:34:13,709 --> 00:34:17,270
Now, you want to talk about it now,
or you want to talk about it later?

402
00:34:19,882 --> 00:34:21,850

403
00:34:22,885 --> 00:34:24,819

He said something,
didn't he? About me?

Yes.

That's not a very nice question to ask somebody...

00:39:50,078 --> 00:39:55,141
My father straight ""A'' student,
geologist and engineer.

476
00:39:55,250 --> 00:39:57,582
But he's right.
I am rotten in math.

477
00:39:57,686 --> 00:40:00,280
Well, speaking of math...

478
00:40:00,388 --> 00:40:04,586
what do you say we head upstairs
and jump on that exam you've got coming up?

479
00:40:04,693 --> 00:40:07,787
Yeah. I need
all the help I can get.

480
00:40:08,830 --> 00:40:11,264
Good night, Mom.
Study hard.

481
00:40:14,302 --> 00:40:17,430
It was really nice meeting you, Steven.
Hope you drop by again soon.

482
00:40:17,539 --> 00:40:20,167
I will.

483
00:40:20,275 --> 00:40:22,800
Steven.

484
00:40:22,911 --> 00:40:24,970
I'll see you later.
Okay.

485
00:40:35,090 --> 00:40:37,615
Would you like
some more coffee?

486
00:40:37,726 --> 00:40:39,694
Uh, okay.

487
00:40:39,795 --> 00:40:41,763
I'll make some.

488
00:40:47,002 --> 00:40:49,527
I want to know why you did it.
I want to know who told you.

489
00:40:49,638 --> 00:40:51,936
<i>Which one of your spies?
That's irrelevant.</i>

490
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:54,474
<i>Irrelevant?
Nothing's irrelevant in this house.</i>

491
00:40:54,576 --> 00:40:57,773
<i>It never has been.
[ Blake ] Where are you going?</i>

492
00:40:57,879 --> 00:41:00,279
Well, I think the two of you
should be alone.

493
00:41:00,382 --> 00:41:05,046
No. You stay. You wanted to be
a part of this family. Now be a part of it.

494
00:41:14,896 --> 00:41:18,491
All right. Now you've married Jeff.
Do you at least love the boy?

495
00:41:21,503 --> 00:41:23,835
Why did you do it?

496
00:41:23,939 --> 00:41:26,965
What made you think I needed your pity,
your concern?

497
00:41:27,075 --> 00:41:29,009
Have I ever
needed it before?

498
00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:32,170
Answer that. I'll answer it
for you. It's no.

499
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:34,840
<i>And you were
going to help me...</i>

500
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:38,716
by agreeing to some unholy pact
with Cecil Colby.

501
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:41,812
What makes you think that I couldn't have
done that myself if I wanted to?

502
00:41:41,923 --> 00:41:44,050
<i>What makes you think that
I haven't been able to...</i>

503
00:41:44,159 --> 00:41:46,559
<i>claw my own way up
from setbacks before?</i>

504
00:41:46,661 --> 00:41:49,027
I've gone to congressmen
and kings...

505
00:41:49,130 --> 00:41:53,760
and dictators and mob bosses
when I needed help, and I got it.

506
00:41:53,869 --> 00:41:58,135
And you were safely
tucked off at schools and...

507
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:01,141
on jets and in
$200anight hotels...

508
00:42:01,243 --> 00:42:03,177
in Rio and Europe
and the Caribbean...

509
00:42:03,278 --> 00:42:05,269
<i>with your beachboys
and soccer studs...</i>

510
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:07,280
<i>and you name 'em,
you found them.</i>

511
00:42:07,382 --> 00:42:10,874
And I was here, without you,
handling the problems

512
00:42:10,986 --> 00:42:12,886
clawing my way
if I had to.

513
00:42:12,988 --> 00:42:14,922
And I did it without
your damned help.

514
00:42:19,027 --> 00:42:22,292
All right. Tell me.
Just tell me this.

515
00:42:22,397 --> 00:42:27,198
What are you going to do a year from now
when I pull myself out of this and I will

516
00:42:27,302 --> 00:42:29,827
What are you going to do
if I find myself in trouble again?

517
00:42:29,938 --> 00:42:32,031
Are you gonna sell yourself
all over again?

518
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:35,109
Blake, don't. She loves you.
She's only trying to

519
00:42:35,210 --> 00:42:38,771
Stay the hell out of this.
It's between my father and me.

520
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:41,246
You apologize
to my wife.

521
00:42:41,349 --> 00:42:43,249
I will not.
Apologize to her.

522
00:42:43,351 --> 00:42:46,218
All right. Don't shut up, Krystle.
Nobody shut up!

523
00:42:46,321 --> 00:42:48,755
All right.
I sold myself.

524
00:42:48,857 --> 00:42:51,917
But let me tell you this.
I'm ready to let the brass ring go.

525
00:42:52,027 --> 00:42:54,052
I have since the first night
I put it on.

526
00:42:54,162 --> 00:42:57,427
No. You keep that on,
and you stay married to that young man.

527
00:42:57,532 --> 00:43:00,330
You make that thing work.
Thing?

528
00:43:00,435 --> 00:43:02,903
That's exactly what it is too.
A thing.

529
00:43:03,004 --> 00:43:05,598
Okay. You don't like it.
Neither do I.

530
00:43:05,707 --> 00:43:07,607
So now that that's
out in the open...

531
00:43:07,709 --> 00:43:10,439
why don't we just let
the whole thing go and forget it?

532
00:43:10,545 --> 00:43:13,514
You're panting for some
respectability around here.

533
00:43:13,615 --> 00:43:16,106
Force it on Steven.
Let him get married.

534
00:43:16,217 --> 00:43:18,344
Make another one
of your kind of deals.

535
00:43:23,558 --> 00:43:27,460
You keep that ring on,
and you make that marriage work!

536
00:44:02,230 --> 00:44:05,290
Chocolate chip cookies
always do that to you?

537
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:08,494
Uh, do what?
Make you smile.

538
00:44:09,671 --> 00:44:11,571
No, I was just
thinking about Lindsay.

539
00:44:11,673 --> 00:44:16,042
Her free spirit.
Her openness.

540
00:44:16,144 --> 00:44:19,580
You know, it seems to leave
so many kids when they reach

541
00:44:19,681 --> 00:44:21,581
I don't know 1 5 or 1 6.

542
00:44:21,683 --> 00:44:25,881
I hope she hangs onto it
that it never leaves her.

543
00:44:25,987 --> 00:44:29,650
Never left you.
I'm not open.

544
00:44:31,159 --> 00:44:33,127
Oh, yes, you are.

545
00:44:35,830 --> 00:44:37,730
I think you are.

546
00:44:39,567 --> 00:44:41,660
About important things.

547
00:44:42,771 --> 00:44:44,705
Like who you are...

548
00:44:44,806 --> 00:44:46,831
what you feel.

549
00:44:54,716 --> 00:44:56,775
Matthew told you about me.

550
00:44:59,554 --> 00:45:01,579
Someone did.

551
00:45:03,191 --> 00:45:05,159
You know, sometimes

552
00:45:06,428 --> 00:45:09,864
Sometimes I wonder
what the hell am I doing?

553
00:45:11,566 --> 00:45:14,967
I mean, what am I doing
there on that job?

554
00:45:16,871 --> 00:45:18,839
Why don't you
leave it, Steven?

555
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:20,874
Why don't you quit?

556
00:45:20,975 --> 00:45:23,409
I don't know.

557
00:45:23,511 --> 00:45:26,207
Oh.

558
00:45:26,314 --> 00:45:29,306
<i>But if I didn't know you
as well as I feel I know you, I'd...</i>

559
00:45:29,417 --> 00:45:33,877
think the boss's wife
was telling me to pack it in.

560
00:45:35,090 --> 00:45:36,990
I am.

561
00:45:41,096 --> 00:45:43,621
I wouldn't think
any less of you.

562
00:45:46,835 --> 00:45:51,329
Well, I wouldn't want to miss
another exquisite meat loaf dinner.

563
00:45:53,341 --> 00:45:55,502
You're always welcome here.

564
00:45:58,446 --> 00:46:00,676
You You mean you'd

565
00:46:00,782 --> 00:46:02,682
you'd really want me?

566
00:46:04,085 --> 00:46:06,815
Yes.

567
00:46:06,921 --> 00:46:09,253
Of course.

568
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:16,118
I'd bring you
flowers next time...

569
00:46:16,231 --> 00:46:18,165
and and make thee
beds of roses.

570
00:46:20,568 --> 00:46:22,661
That's That's from a poem.

571
00:46:22,770 --> 00:46:25,034
Uh, it's Marlowe, I think.

572
00:46:27,542 --> 00:46:30,511
""A Shepherd Sings
to His Love.''

573
00:46:33,515 --> 00:46:37,051
God. You know,
I have acquired this crazy habit...

574
00:46:37,251 --> 00:46:39,851
of quoting to you.
