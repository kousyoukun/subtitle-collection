1
00:00:00,069 --> 00:00:03,029
- <i>Previously on</i> Dynasty...
- What I did was wrong.

2
00:00:03,031 --> 00:00:05,164
<i>Not just my relationship with Matthew,</i>

3
00:00:05,166 --> 00:00:07,433
but continuing the lie after he died.

4
00:00:08,536 --> 00:00:09,869
<i>It was no accident!</i>

5
00:00:09,871 --> 00:00:11,977
You killed my husband!

6
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:13,039
I know everything.

7
00:00:13,041 --> 00:00:14,407
Ms. Celia Machado.

8
00:00:16,497 --> 00:00:17,596
<i>Baby's fine.</i>

9
00:00:17,598 --> 00:00:18,367
- Baby?
- She's pregnant?

10
00:00:18,466 --> 00:00:19,997
<i>We'll take her home to the manor.</i>

11
00:00:20,001 --> 00:00:22,801
They ran some tests,
and Claudia's pills aren't right.

12
00:00:22,803 --> 00:00:24,970
<i>Someone switched the pills.</i>

13
00:00:26,337 --> 00:00:27,306
Claudia.

14
00:00:27,308 --> 00:00:28,340
What are you doing?

15
00:00:28,342 --> 00:00:30,042
What the hell's going on?

16
00:00:30,044 --> 00:00:31,376
- Get out!
- I'm sorry!

17
00:00:31,378 --> 00:00:32,172
Get out!

18
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:35,414
She needs more help than we can provide.

19
00:00:35,416 --> 00:00:36,615
Wouldn't want to ruin anything we got

20
00:00:36,617 --> 00:00:38,050
<i>going here business-wise</i>

21
00:00:38,052 --> 00:00:39,351
<i>'cause you couldn't keep
it in your pants, right?</i>

22
00:00:39,353 --> 00:00:42,020
<i>You finally got a chance to seduce me.</i>

23
00:01:06,688 --> 00:01:08,046
Anders.

24
00:01:08,048 --> 00:01:09,348
Happy Thanksgiving.

25
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:11,083
It's 7:00 a.m.

26
00:01:11,085 --> 00:01:12,884
I know. Who wakes up this early, right?

27
00:01:12,886 --> 00:01:14,453
But I was so excited.

28
00:01:14,455 --> 00:01:18,123
What I mean is it's 7:00 a.m.
and my cooks are behind schedule

29
00:01:18,125 --> 00:01:19,558
because you are in the way.

30
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,460
The Carringtons are expecting guests

31
00:01:21,462 --> 00:01:23,762
for Thanksgiving,
not to mention my staff,

32
00:01:23,764 --> 00:01:26,398
who are working hard to get
home to their own family.

33
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,000
And I am trying to help.

34
00:01:28,002 --> 00:01:29,167
This is a Venezuelan dish

35
00:01:29,169 --> 00:01:30,736
my mom makes for the holidays:

36
00:01:30,738 --> 00:01:32,571
pan de jamón.

37
00:01:32,573 --> 00:01:33,772
I'm almost done.

38
00:01:33,774 --> 00:01:35,407
It'll be worth all the trouble,
I promise.

39
00:01:35,409 --> 00:01:37,509
Even Julia Child couldn't create a dish

40
00:01:37,511 --> 00:01:39,378
worth the trouble you cause.

41
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:41,613
40 minutes at 350 degrees.

42
00:01:42,716 --> 00:01:44,883
Ready for the big day?

43
00:01:46,153 --> 00:01:48,887
Why did you summon me
here at the crack of dawn?

44
00:01:48,889 --> 00:01:50,188
This is the first time

45
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:51,356
you've been home for
Thanksgiving in years,

46
00:01:51,358 --> 00:01:52,557
and I've got big plans.

47
00:01:52,559 --> 00:01:53,925
I didn't get the memo.

48
00:01:53,927 --> 00:01:55,127
You should have.

49
00:01:55,129 --> 00:01:58,230
I asked the Anders to
e-mail the itinerary.

50
00:01:59,231 --> 00:01:59,965
How about we warm up

51
00:01:59,967 --> 00:02:02,534
before the family versus
staff pigskin toss.

52
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:05,237
You're my secret weapon today.

53
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:07,039
- What about Fallon?
- Well, she can't...

54
00:02:07,041 --> 00:02:08,907
do that since she tore her ACL.

55
00:02:08,909 --> 00:02:11,710
With you home,
we stand a real chance of winning.

56
00:02:11,712 --> 00:02:14,312
Hate to say, but I prefer boxing.

57
00:02:14,314 --> 00:02:17,215
Actually, I wanted to talk to
you about that athletic club.

58
00:02:17,217 --> 00:02:18,517
I've been looking at the books,

59
00:02:18,519 --> 00:02:20,719
and their grant seems bloated.

60
00:02:20,721 --> 00:02:22,421
I admire your tenacity,

61
00:02:22,423 --> 00:02:25,557
but let's take the day off work.

62
00:02:25,559 --> 00:02:27,426
I'm just trying to clean things up.

63
00:02:27,428 --> 00:02:29,094
Do the most good that we can.

64
00:02:29,096 --> 00:02:31,163
And that extra funding could be spread

65
00:02:31,165 --> 00:02:33,006
to other deserving organizations.

66
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:35,333
Don't you touch a cent of that donation.

67
00:02:35,335 --> 00:02:36,601
Those kids count on us.

68
00:02:36,603 --> 00:02:37,969
Now, no more work talk.

69
00:02:37,971 --> 00:02:39,404
Today's about family

70
00:02:39,406 --> 00:02:41,540
and winning this football game.

71
00:02:41,542 --> 00:02:44,142
Let's see how far that
arm of yours can throw.

72
00:03:03,873 --> 00:03:05,931
Our first Thanksgiving.

73
00:03:05,933 --> 00:03:08,567
And I've never had more
to be grateful for.

74
00:03:14,842 --> 00:03:16,641
Oh, time for Claudia's meds.

75
00:03:16,643 --> 00:03:18,577
Of course.

76
00:03:20,314 --> 00:03:22,948
I was hoping to spend
today with just family.

77
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:24,416
Tell me about it.

78
00:03:24,418 --> 00:03:26,017
I was all ready to send her home

79
00:03:26,019 --> 00:03:27,452
until this medication mix-up.

80
00:03:27,454 --> 00:03:29,722
Isn't her nurse the best
person to sort that out?

81
00:03:29,723 --> 00:03:31,957
Unless her nurse is
the one screwing it up.

82
00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:33,325
No, it's a holiday.

83
00:03:33,327 --> 00:03:35,060
Claudia can't take care of herself.

84
00:03:35,062 --> 00:03:36,795
After all the hell she's been through,

85
00:03:36,797 --> 00:03:38,263
the hell we've put her through,

86
00:03:38,265 --> 00:03:40,765
I just want to make sure
she doesn't suffer anymore.

87
00:03:40,767 --> 00:03:44,136
And you know I love your big heart.

88
00:03:44,138 --> 00:03:46,204
I just don't want Carrington Manor

89
00:03:46,206 --> 00:03:47,572
turned into a loony bin.

90
00:03:47,574 --> 00:03:49,374
Wouldn't take much.

91
00:03:50,811 --> 00:03:53,044
- You two are traveling light.
- It's the Bahamas.

92
00:03:53,046 --> 00:03:56,081
What else do I need besides
swimsuits and sarongs?

93
00:03:56,529 --> 00:03:57,649
While you're on a beach

94
00:03:57,651 --> 00:03:59,251
eating conch fritters, I'll be stuck

95
00:03:59,253 --> 00:04:01,318
with the traditional
football and skeet shooting.

96
00:04:01,353 --> 00:04:03,488
Is skeet shooting traditional?

97
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:05,891
Also, aren't you in exile?

98
00:04:05,893 --> 00:04:07,325
Well, going home for a big holiday

99
00:04:07,327 --> 00:04:09,361
is the perfect way to get
back on Daddy's good side.

100
00:04:09,363 --> 00:04:11,496
Honestly, he'll probably be
begging me to move back in

101
00:04:11,498 --> 00:04:12,831
before the pecan pie is served.

102
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:14,666
Well, if you change your mind,
you know where we'll be.

103
00:04:14,668 --> 00:04:16,768
Yeah.

104
00:04:23,744 --> 00:04:25,644
If she changes her mind?

105
00:04:25,646 --> 00:04:27,245
And how would that work?

106
00:04:27,247 --> 00:04:28,747
I knew she'd never say yes.

107
00:04:29,616 --> 00:04:30,402
Let's hit the road.

108
00:04:30,417 --> 00:04:32,384
- I'm not going.
- Monica.

109
00:04:32,386 --> 00:04:34,419
You know we're only gonna be let down.

110
00:04:34,421 --> 00:04:35,720
So, what are you gonna do?

111
00:04:35,722 --> 00:04:37,022
So we're not both liars,

112
00:04:37,024 --> 00:04:39,391
I'm actually going to the Bahamas.

113
00:04:41,826 --> 00:04:44,162
If you were smart, you'd come with me.

114
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:46,598
<i>I don't understand</i>

115
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,800
how the pills got in the wrong bottles.

116
00:04:48,802 --> 00:04:50,869
Neither do I, but I do think

117
00:04:50,871 --> 00:04:52,871
that the fact that you were
on the wrong medication

118
00:04:52,873 --> 00:04:55,640
accounts for some of your...
mood swings.

119
00:04:56,473 --> 00:04:59,277
I didn't mean to take a
bath with your husband.

120
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:02,647
All I want is for you to get better.

121
00:05:02,649 --> 00:05:03,949
We'll figure it out.

122
00:05:03,951 --> 00:05:06,484
- I'm gonna call your nurse later today.
- Why?

123
00:05:06,486 --> 00:05:08,687
Well, she was the one handling
your medications, wasn't she?

124
00:05:08,689 --> 00:05:10,355
Oh. Um...

125
00:05:10,357 --> 00:05:11,356
What is it?

126
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:14,025
Matthew, he...

127
00:05:14,027 --> 00:05:15,360
he never trusted her.

128
00:05:15,362 --> 00:05:17,028
He thought she might
be stealing from us.

129
00:05:17,887 --> 00:05:19,831
But maybe I'm...
I'm not remembering it right.

130
00:05:21,591 --> 00:05:22,934
Was she stealing from us?

131
00:05:22,936 --> 00:05:26,037
I don't know,
but I'm gonna get to the bottom of this.

132
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:27,687
We should head outside.

133
00:05:27,741 --> 00:05:29,674
Is that where the TV is?
I thought we were

134
00:05:29,676 --> 00:05:31,309
- watching football.
- We are.

135
00:05:31,311 --> 00:05:33,745
Carrington style.

136
00:05:39,486 --> 00:05:40,993
I come in peace...

137
00:05:41,288 --> 00:05:42,721
...with a literal peace offering:

138
00:05:42,723 --> 00:05:45,156
my dad's playbook.
I pinched it from his study.

139
00:05:45,158 --> 00:05:47,259
You really think you can just
hand me that and we're good?

140
00:05:47,261 --> 00:05:48,593
Well, I think you want to win.

141
00:05:48,595 --> 00:05:49,861
I win every year.

142
00:05:49,863 --> 00:05:51,796
And that crap you pulled at Jeff's?
It took me all night

143
00:05:51,798 --> 00:05:53,531
to get out of the doghouse with Kori.

144
00:05:53,533 --> 00:05:54,566
- All night, huh?
- Does your father

145
00:05:54,568 --> 00:05:56,701
- even know you're here?
- Unlike you, my dad

146
00:05:56,703 --> 00:05:57,836
can't hold a grudge.

147
00:05:57,838 --> 00:06:00,305
Not today, at least.
He needs me on his team.

148
00:06:00,307 --> 00:06:02,641
Look, can we just talk?
If not now, after the game?

149
00:06:02,643 --> 00:06:04,709
I can't. I have my own traditions.

150
00:06:04,711 --> 00:06:06,911
I'm only here because I have to be.

151
00:06:06,913 --> 00:06:09,514
For some reason your father
thinks we actually enjoy this.

152
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:24,896
Thank God you're here.

153
00:06:24,898 --> 00:06:26,464
Dad's decided I'm Tom Brady.

154
00:06:26,466 --> 00:06:28,633
I'm sorry I'm late.

155
00:06:28,635 --> 00:06:30,135
I wasn't expecting you at all.

156
00:06:30,137 --> 00:06:32,070
You know I'd never miss this.

157
00:06:32,072 --> 00:06:33,371
Steven can't just waltz back in here

158
00:06:33,373 --> 00:06:34,773
expecting to be QB.

159
00:06:34,775 --> 00:06:36,574
Then I assume you're ready to apologize?

160
00:06:37,454 --> 00:06:38,410
Well, you can't just waltz

161
00:06:38,412 --> 00:06:40,545
back in here and expect
everything to be forgotten.

162
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:43,381
I'm sorry.

163
00:06:43,383 --> 00:06:45,684
Not to me.

164
00:06:45,686 --> 00:06:46,718
Cristal.

165
00:06:50,724 --> 00:06:52,691
Here? Now?

166
00:06:52,693 --> 00:06:54,292
I'm sorry.

167
00:06:54,294 --> 00:06:55,527
What?

168
00:06:55,529 --> 00:06:56,695
Sorry for...

169
00:06:56,697 --> 00:07:00,265
I'm sorry for having
ever seen your sex tape.

170
00:07:01,297 --> 00:07:02,500
And for leaking it.

171
00:07:02,502 --> 00:07:04,602
Well, I appreciate your apology, Fallon.

172
00:07:04,604 --> 00:07:07,453
- I really hope that we can...
- Hines Ward.

173
00:07:07,488 --> 00:07:08,714
Hey, Fallon.

174
00:07:08,749 --> 00:07:10,102
How are you?

175
00:07:10,137 --> 00:07:12,644
Oh, I'm so happy
you're on my team this year.

176
00:07:12,646 --> 00:07:15,080
- You know I'm always on your team. Blake.
- Aw.

177
00:07:15,082 --> 00:07:17,549
- Hines.
- Oh, Jamal.

178
00:07:17,551 --> 00:07:20,151
Fallon. So good to see you again.

179
00:07:20,153 --> 00:07:22,087
Oh! Dirty bird.

180
00:07:24,958 --> 00:07:26,024
Hey, Joe.

181
00:07:26,026 --> 00:07:27,192
- There she is.
- Aw.

182
00:07:27,194 --> 00:07:30,061
- Good to see you.
- You, too.

183
00:07:37,738 --> 00:07:39,504
Whole team.

184
00:07:39,506 --> 00:07:41,406
And yet not one sex tape.

185
00:07:41,408 --> 00:07:43,441
All right, that's it.
If you can't respect this family...

186
00:07:43,443 --> 00:07:44,943
<i>everyone</i> in this family...

187
00:07:44,945 --> 00:07:46,444
then you can spend
Thanksgiving with another one.

188
00:07:46,446 --> 00:07:48,446
- It was a joke.
- Take the jersey off.

189
00:07:49,282 --> 00:07:50,215
Dad, let her play.

190
00:07:50,217 --> 00:07:51,316
Take it off.

191
00:07:54,554 --> 00:07:55,920
- Sam?
- What?

192
00:07:55,922 --> 00:07:58,390
- You're in.
- But I don't know anything

193
00:07:58,392 --> 00:07:59,591
about American football.

194
00:07:59,593 --> 00:08:02,260
You'll do fine.
Maybe you can join us next year,

195
00:08:02,262 --> 00:08:04,329
after you figure out
the meaning of family.

196
00:08:04,331 --> 00:08:07,065
Anders. Let's get this game going.

197
00:08:43,269 --> 00:08:44,535
Yeah. Forward.

198
00:08:44,537 --> 00:08:46,504
Set, hut! Hut!

199
00:08:57,535 --> 00:08:58,549
What are you doing?

200
00:08:58,551 --> 00:09:00,184
Well, since I'll be gone for a while,

201
00:09:00,186 --> 00:09:01,453
I might as well bring
my winter closet now.

202
00:09:01,485 --> 00:09:02,617
You're giving up without a fight?

203
00:09:02,619 --> 00:09:03,552
You really think I care

204
00:09:03,554 --> 00:09:05,053
about Dad's stupid football game?

205
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,423
We always lose, anyway.

206
00:09:08,425 --> 00:09:09,693
Why don't I come with you?

207
00:09:09,694 --> 00:09:11,694
- We can do our own thing.
- No, no, stay.

208
00:09:11,695 --> 00:09:13,995
You and Dad are in a better
place than you've been in years.

209
00:09:14,057 --> 00:09:15,723
Same place, different issue.

210
00:09:15,725 --> 00:09:19,160
I'm pretty sure Dad's been using
Foundation money to pay off Stansfield.

211
00:09:19,162 --> 00:09:21,262
At the least,
we know he tampered with evidence.

212
00:09:21,264 --> 00:09:24,032
Oh, my God, are you still
hung up on this Willy thing?

213
00:09:24,034 --> 00:09:26,067
It's no coincidence that I
made a deal with Stansfield

214
00:09:26,069 --> 00:09:27,702
right before Willy turned up dead

215
00:09:27,704 --> 00:09:29,904
with a written confession
to Matthew's murder.

216
00:09:29,906 --> 00:09:31,639
Steven, don't go there.

217
00:09:31,641 --> 00:09:32,940
Don't poke the bear.

218
00:09:32,942 --> 00:09:36,044
It's a Pandora's box with
a can of worms inside.

219
00:09:36,046 --> 00:09:38,513
- So you think I should...
- Let sleeping dogs lie.

220
00:09:38,515 --> 00:09:40,982
You really want to bring
the FBI around here again?

221
00:09:42,185 --> 00:09:44,419
Who looks after you when I'm gone?

222
00:09:44,421 --> 00:09:45,653
So stay.

223
00:09:46,364 --> 00:09:48,823
I can't. I have other plans.

224
00:09:54,364 --> 00:09:57,098
Hey, you. You good?

225
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,998
Well, I'd be better on a white
beach with a Dark 'n' Stormy.

226
00:09:59,003 --> 00:10:01,703
Oh, Blake didn't welcome you
back with open arms, huh?

227
00:10:02,086 --> 00:10:02,804
Shocker.

228
00:10:02,806 --> 00:10:05,073
No. No, actually, I decided to bail.

229
00:10:05,075 --> 00:10:07,575
Do you think I can still
grab a seat on the jet?

230
00:10:07,577 --> 00:10:09,610
Oh, uh...

231
00:10:09,612 --> 00:10:11,846
Monica and I are just
pulling up to the plane.

232
00:10:11,848 --> 00:10:14,916
We're wheels up any second.

233
00:10:14,918 --> 00:10:16,651
But let's plan another trip.

234
00:10:16,653 --> 00:10:17,819
Maybe New Years?

235
00:10:17,821 --> 00:10:21,122
Yeah. Perfect.

236
00:10:24,728 --> 00:10:26,661
Let's go!

237
00:10:26,663 --> 00:10:28,029
Set! Hike!

238
00:11:05,301 --> 00:11:06,834
Come on, bring it in, bring it in.

239
00:11:06,836 --> 00:11:08,603
Time is running out.

240
00:11:08,605 --> 00:11:11,839
Staff lead 36 to 32.

241
00:11:11,841 --> 00:11:13,268
Okay, okay, this is our last chance.

242
00:11:13,277 --> 00:11:15,743
Steven, it's time for that pass
play we worked on this morning.

243
00:11:15,745 --> 00:11:18,413
- Got it.
- Hines, Hines'll buy you enough time.

244
00:11:18,415 --> 00:11:19,680
Break!

245
00:11:23,286 --> 00:11:24,886
Gold 19!

246
00:11:24,888 --> 00:11:26,287
Gold eight!

247
00:11:26,289 --> 00:11:28,222
Ready!

248
00:11:28,224 --> 00:11:30,057
Set! Hike!

249
00:11:52,882 --> 00:11:54,916
Okay, all right.

250
00:11:54,918 --> 00:11:58,186
So, staff wins for the...
who knows how many years

251
00:11:58,188 --> 00:11:59,620
- in a row?
- Uh, six.

252
00:11:59,622 --> 00:12:01,456
Six. Six. For the record.

253
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:02,924
No, truly,

254
00:12:02,926 --> 00:12:05,660
thank you...
for keeping this place together.

255
00:12:06,364 --> 00:12:08,863
Our family appreciates your dedication.

256
00:12:08,865 --> 00:12:10,598
And even though you won...

257
00:12:11,951 --> 00:12:13,401
take the rest of the weekend off.

258
00:12:14,571 --> 00:12:16,637
Oh. And don't forget there's pie!

259
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:20,074
Go and buy some pie.

260
00:12:20,076 --> 00:12:21,843
Culhane's actually really good.

261
00:12:21,845 --> 00:12:23,311
He almost played for the Falcons.

262
00:12:23,313 --> 00:12:25,480
I hired him to drive
after he was injured,

263
00:12:25,482 --> 00:12:27,381
almost ten years ago.

264
00:12:27,383 --> 00:12:29,784
Sam is...<i> not</i> good.

265
00:12:30,233 --> 00:12:32,086
Well, at least he warned you.

266
00:12:32,088 --> 00:12:33,788
Look, now that it's over,

267
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:35,756
I really think you should call Fallon.

268
00:12:35,758 --> 00:12:37,959
You didn't need to send
her away for my sake.

269
00:12:37,961 --> 00:12:40,361
I did it for hers. She has to learn.

270
00:12:40,363 --> 00:12:41,829
Yeah, but it's Thanksgiving...

271
00:12:41,831 --> 00:12:43,898
Even I can make room for her today.

272
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:47,248
Of course you can...
because kind people like you

273
00:12:47,283 --> 00:12:48,769
find it hard to stick up for themselves,

274
00:12:48,771 --> 00:12:51,072
which is why you need people like me.

275
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:55,610
Claudia seems better today.

276
00:12:56,579 --> 00:12:59,513
Well, she's on the right meds, at least.

277
00:12:59,785 --> 00:13:01,749
But I have a call in to her nurse.

278
00:13:01,751 --> 00:13:05,253
Apparently, Matthew was worried
that she was stealing from them.

279
00:13:05,255 --> 00:13:07,655
How much could they have to steal?

280
00:13:07,657 --> 00:13:08,756
Well, I don't know,

281
00:13:08,758 --> 00:13:10,491
but the nurse controlled
everything for Claudia.

282
00:13:10,493 --> 00:13:12,493
Maybe she wanted to keep it that way

283
00:13:12,495 --> 00:13:14,295
by making Claudia sick.

284
00:13:20,418 --> 00:13:21,602
Ooh, yeah.

285
00:13:21,604 --> 00:13:23,204
Mr. Belford, tell me

286
00:13:23,206 --> 00:13:25,540
you didn't get roped into
the science experiment.

287
00:13:25,542 --> 00:13:27,275
I can't believe you
threw my first one away.

288
00:13:27,277 --> 00:13:28,809
It's a surprise for my aunt.

289
00:13:28,811 --> 00:13:30,545
That will appear on
the Thanksgiving table

290
00:13:30,547 --> 00:13:32,547
over my dead body.

291
00:13:34,101 --> 00:13:35,149
Mrs. Blaisdel?

292
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:38,185
Can I help you?

293
00:13:38,187 --> 00:13:40,888
Just the wine cellar
and storage down there.

294
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:43,124
Oh. Oh, I'm so sorry, I thought...

295
00:13:43,126 --> 00:13:44,759
I thought it led upstairs.

296
00:13:44,761 --> 00:13:47,028
Well, it can be confusing...
such a big house.

297
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:49,897
I have the perfect solution...
Mr. Jones here

298
00:13:49,899 --> 00:13:51,632
can escort you,

299
00:13:51,634 --> 00:13:54,468
now that he's done
making his ham pockets.

300
00:13:57,073 --> 00:13:58,139
Thank you so much.

301
00:14:05,592 --> 00:14:08,249
Whatever you do, don't be stingy
with those mashed potatoes.

302
00:14:09,334 --> 00:14:10,051
Well, if there's anything

303
00:14:10,053 --> 00:14:12,219
that can unite rich and poor,
it's carbs.

304
00:14:12,221 --> 00:14:13,470
What on earth are you doing here?

305
00:14:13,523 --> 00:14:15,556
You don't think I know what
you do every Thanksgiving?

306
00:14:15,558 --> 00:14:17,458
I pay attention. Sometimes.

307
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:18,726
What, you think

308
00:14:18,728 --> 00:14:20,861
I'm too stuck up to sling
rehydrated potatoes?

309
00:14:20,863 --> 00:14:23,230
I think you've ostracized
everyone else in your life.

310
00:14:23,232 --> 00:14:24,465
Okay, well, maybe I wanted to give back,

311
00:14:24,467 --> 00:14:26,200
you know,
help out at a homeless shelter.

312
00:14:26,202 --> 00:14:27,768
This is a church.

313
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:29,136
Well, it's the same thing.

314
00:14:29,138 --> 00:14:31,606
Okay, you know what?
Fallon, please, just go.

315
00:14:31,608 --> 00:14:34,542
Michael,
stop talking to the beautiful lady.

316
00:14:34,544 --> 00:14:36,644
- We got a dozen more trays to bring out.
- Got it.

317
00:14:36,646 --> 00:14:38,245
Who do we have here?

318
00:14:38,247 --> 00:14:39,547
Hi. I'm Fallon.

319
00:14:39,549 --> 00:14:40,781
Fallon Carrington?

320
00:14:40,783 --> 00:14:42,049
You work with Michael?

321
00:14:42,051 --> 00:14:44,785
Uh... I do.

322
00:14:44,787 --> 00:14:46,520
I'm Luella Culhane.

323
00:14:46,522 --> 00:14:49,223
And this is my husband, James.
We're Michael's...

324
00:14:49,225 --> 00:14:50,424
Oh, you're Michael's parents.

325
00:14:50,426 --> 00:14:52,627
Wow, what a pleasure to meet you.

326
00:14:52,629 --> 00:14:54,929
You, too.
We couldn't be prouder of our boy,

327
00:14:54,931 --> 00:14:57,231
- moving up so quickly.
- Aw, now, Luella,

328
00:14:57,233 --> 00:14:59,533
don't go embarrassing him
in front of his colleagues.

329
00:14:59,535 --> 00:15:02,637
I mean, he<i> is</i> the first vice
president in the family, though.

330
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:05,239
Is he?

331
00:15:05,241 --> 00:15:07,642
Well, that really is something.

332
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:16,396
Okay, well, thank you for your time.

333
00:15:16,398 --> 00:15:17,898
Sam.

334
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:20,159
- Have you seen Claudia?
- I walked her up to her room

335
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:21,855
a little while ago. What's going on?

336
00:15:21,871 --> 00:15:24,104
This pill thing is getting
weirder and weirder.

337
00:15:24,106 --> 00:15:26,239
When I talked to her this morning,
she seemed to think

338
00:15:26,241 --> 00:15:28,775
- her nurse was trying to take advantage of her.
- Well, that's awful.

339
00:15:28,777 --> 00:15:30,810
Well, it would be,
except I just talked to her nurse,

340
00:15:30,812 --> 00:15:32,546
and she said that Claudia
fired her last week.

341
00:15:32,548 --> 00:15:34,080
'Cause she thought

342
00:15:34,082 --> 00:15:36,483
- she was stealing from her?
- That's what I thought, but she said

343
00:15:36,485 --> 00:15:39,886
she caught Claudia skipping her
meds and taking benzos instead,

344
00:15:39,888 --> 00:15:40,954
and when she said something,

345
00:15:40,956 --> 00:15:42,622
Claudia told her not to come back.

346
00:15:42,624 --> 00:15:45,025
I told you, you never should
have brought Claudia here.

347
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:46,660
It's like my mom used to say...

348
00:15:46,662 --> 00:15:49,629
You bring in a stray,
you're gonna get fleas. I know.

349
00:15:49,631 --> 00:15:52,098
- Please, just help me look for her.
- Mm.

350
00:15:53,502 --> 00:15:54,668
Pull.

351
00:15:59,175 --> 00:16:01,441
I was worried you were gonna
make me shoot our dinner.

352
00:16:01,443 --> 00:16:03,910
Well, of course not.
The turkey hunt was last week.

353
00:16:07,149 --> 00:16:08,281
No, I'm good, thanks.

354
00:16:08,283 --> 00:16:09,883
You know this is just a gun.

355
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:13,453
Not good, not evil. Just... a tool.

356
00:16:13,455 --> 00:16:15,221
Not a very peaceful tool.

357
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:19,025
I respect your ideals, Steven. I do.

358
00:16:19,027 --> 00:16:23,463
I just... I wish they didn't
make us butt heads all the time.

359
00:16:23,465 --> 00:16:24,474
Everything's an issue with you.

360
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:27,133
I appreciate our
father-son bonding time.

361
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:29,603
Football with the pros,
skeet shooting...

362
00:16:29,605 --> 00:16:31,104
it's like a billionaire's biathlon.

363
00:16:31,106 --> 00:16:33,206
There's always fencing if you
want to make it a triathlon.

364
00:16:33,815 --> 00:16:35,108
Pull.

365
00:16:38,669 --> 00:16:39,980
I got to be honest.

366
00:16:39,982 --> 00:16:42,816
I feel you're only buddying
up to me because...

367
00:16:42,818 --> 00:16:44,651
And you think since I'm mad at Fallon

368
00:16:44,653 --> 00:16:46,953
that I'm trying to somehow
replace her with you.

369
00:16:46,955 --> 00:16:48,521
- Well, I'm not.
- No. No.

370
00:16:48,523 --> 00:16:50,323
I think you're actually buttering me up

371
00:16:50,325 --> 00:16:52,158
because you don't want
me to look any deeper

372
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,827
into what you're doing
with the Foundation money.

373
00:16:53,829 --> 00:16:57,530
- Ah.
- I've seen the books.

374
00:16:58,251 --> 00:16:59,833
I know that donation isn't all going

375
00:16:59,835 --> 00:17:01,134
where you're saying it does.

376
00:17:01,136 --> 00:17:04,104
- Mm.
- And I want you to know that I'm stopping it.

377
00:17:10,683 --> 00:17:14,581
Would you agree that we occupy
a unique position in the world?

378
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:16,716
Of course, but I don't see...

379
00:17:16,718 --> 00:17:18,151
And all our wealth and power

380
00:17:18,153 --> 00:17:22,822
gives us the privilege of...
doing a lot of good.

381
00:17:22,824 --> 00:17:25,091
We could do more good if we
weren't wasting our money

382
00:17:25,093 --> 00:17:27,093
to finance police corruption.

383
00:17:28,462 --> 00:17:31,464
The world is way more complex
than it is black and white.

384
00:17:31,466 --> 00:17:32,866
In order for us to give back,

385
00:17:32,868 --> 00:17:34,501
we first have to protect what we have.

386
00:17:35,479 --> 00:17:37,137
That's a really convenient way

387
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:38,371
to ignore right and wrong.

388
00:17:38,373 --> 00:17:40,740
I've been in this game a
lot longer than you, Son.

389
00:17:40,742 --> 00:17:42,175
Now, you're just gonna have to accept

390
00:17:42,177 --> 00:17:44,377
that the rules are
different at this level.

391
00:17:53,321 --> 00:17:56,122
Well, I'm not sure exactly
what your son told you,

392
00:17:56,124 --> 00:17:57,490
but the truth is...

393
00:17:57,492 --> 00:17:58,858
Michael and I don't work together.

394
00:17:59,595 --> 00:18:00,794
We used to.

395
00:18:00,796 --> 00:18:02,996
I left my dad's company to start my own.

396
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:05,231
Michael was such a talented executive

397
00:18:05,233 --> 00:18:06,399
that I tried to poach him,

398
00:18:06,401 --> 00:18:08,635
but your son's got some
pretty strong morals.

399
00:18:08,637 --> 00:18:10,136
Well, that's how we raised him.

400
00:18:10,138 --> 00:18:13,373
Yeah, but I do miss being around him.

401
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:15,542
And I wish things were different.

402
00:18:15,544 --> 00:18:17,510
Well, that's very nice of you to say.

403
00:18:17,512 --> 00:18:18,738
So, Fallon,

404
00:18:18,781 --> 00:18:21,948
are you the mystery girl that's
coming to dinner tonight?

405
00:18:22,984 --> 00:18:24,484
Oh, Lu makes a mean sweet potato pie.

406
00:18:24,486 --> 00:18:26,553
Uh, no.

407
00:18:26,555 --> 00:18:29,222
You guys must be thinking of
Michael's girlfriend, Kori.

408
00:18:29,224 --> 00:18:31,291
I'm sure you'll love her.

409
00:18:54,983 --> 00:18:56,098
There you are.

410
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:59,085
- Oh, Sam. You scared me.
- No, you scared me.

411
00:18:59,087 --> 00:19:01,020
I've been all over this
house looking for you.

412
00:19:01,022 --> 00:19:02,489
Cristal needs to talk to you.

413
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:04,491
What are you doing down here?

414
00:19:04,493 --> 00:19:06,126
I woke up with the worst headache,

415
00:19:06,128 --> 00:19:07,293
and I went looking for aspirin.

416
00:19:07,295 --> 00:19:08,632
I keep opening up all the wrong doors.

417
00:19:08,697 --> 00:19:10,764
Come on, the aspirin's in
the kitchen next to the mugs.

418
00:19:10,766 --> 00:19:12,699
- I'll show you.
- Okay.

419
00:19:12,701 --> 00:19:15,235
Of course they have a gun room.

420
00:19:19,541 --> 00:19:21,040
Wait, did you get in here?

421
00:19:31,266 --> 00:19:33,207
That girl's come back
four times for straws.

422
00:19:33,209 --> 00:19:34,676
Should I buy her some real toys?

423
00:19:34,678 --> 00:19:35,843
Maybe her own dispenser?

424
00:19:35,845 --> 00:19:37,178
Well, maybe there's a straw shortage

425
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:38,513
and she's driving up stock prices.

426
00:19:38,515 --> 00:19:39,547
You don't know.

427
00:19:39,549 --> 00:19:41,349
No, you're right.

428
00:19:41,351 --> 00:19:43,151
You don't know people.

429
00:19:43,153 --> 00:19:45,620
Like when you discover that
your friend is pretending to be

430
00:19:45,622 --> 00:19:47,355
an executive at your dad's company.

431
00:19:47,357 --> 00:19:49,424
Yeah.

432
00:19:49,888 --> 00:19:52,600
Thank you for covering for me.

433
00:19:52,635 --> 00:19:54,228
I'm sure you've got your reasons.

434
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:56,030
I mean, you saw how proud they are.

435
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:59,500
I've always been their great hope.

436
00:19:59,502 --> 00:20:02,270
Football scholarship, pro contract.

437
00:20:02,272 --> 00:20:05,239
Even after I got hurt
and lost the money,

438
00:20:05,241 --> 00:20:07,241
they were determined
that I'd be something,

439
00:20:07,243 --> 00:20:09,177
made me promise I'd graduate.

440
00:20:09,179 --> 00:20:10,211
Well, didn't you?

441
00:20:10,213 --> 00:20:12,480
Damn right I did.

442
00:20:12,482 --> 00:20:14,148
But it cost them.

443
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:16,317
A second mortgage on the house,

444
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:17,885
Dad working two jobs.

445
00:20:17,887 --> 00:20:21,322
They went without a lot
so I could be someone.

446
00:20:21,324 --> 00:20:23,992
How am I supposed to tell them
they that just so their son

447
00:20:23,994 --> 00:20:25,994
could drive some rich
white guy around all day?

448
00:20:25,996 --> 00:20:28,229
So you lie because you're ashamed?

449
00:20:28,231 --> 00:20:30,098
No.

450
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,966
It's because I know they would be.

451
00:20:36,272 --> 00:20:37,772
Sorry they thought you were Kori.

452
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:40,408
Well, at least now I know
why I never got an invite

453
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:41,509
to meet the parents.

454
00:20:41,511 --> 00:20:43,444
I'm still glad it happened though.

455
00:20:45,115 --> 00:20:47,749
So, you and Kori...

456
00:20:47,751 --> 00:20:49,050
you're a couple.

457
00:20:49,052 --> 00:20:50,418
Couples do Thanksgiving.

458
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:51,652
Mm-hmm.

459
00:20:51,654 --> 00:20:53,621
- That's the grown-up thing to say, right?
- Yes.

460
00:20:53,623 --> 00:20:55,590
Yes, it is.

461
00:20:55,592 --> 00:20:58,326
You know what else would
be grown-up of you?

462
00:20:58,328 --> 00:21:00,294
Just go home to your family.

463
00:21:01,497 --> 00:21:03,756
Well, my dad told me
to find a new family.

464
00:21:03,791 --> 00:21:07,435
As anyone here can tell you,
you only get one.

465
00:21:12,342 --> 00:21:14,242
I got to go.

466
00:21:15,088 --> 00:21:16,210
You should, too.

467
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:19,213
Go... home.

468
00:21:33,385 --> 00:21:34,762
Perfection.

469
00:21:34,764 --> 00:21:36,864
Thank you for staying to see it through.

470
00:21:36,866 --> 00:21:38,599
Have a lovely weekend.

471
00:21:44,007 --> 00:21:45,473
We need wine.

472
00:21:48,457 --> 00:21:49,477
I've chosen a bottle.

473
00:21:49,479 --> 00:21:52,547
1976 Chateau Lafitte.

474
00:21:52,549 --> 00:21:54,582
Oh. Doesn't mean much to me.

475
00:21:55,152 --> 00:21:57,952
It is... so beautiful.

476
00:21:59,192 --> 00:22:01,856
- Such a deep red.
- Please be careful.

477
00:22:01,858 --> 00:22:03,458
That wine is older than you are.

478
00:22:04,438 --> 00:22:04,926
Yeah.

479
00:22:04,928 --> 00:22:07,195
Oh! Oh, my God!

480
00:22:07,197 --> 00:22:08,830
I am so sorry!

481
00:22:08,832 --> 00:22:10,364
Oh, not to worry.

482
00:22:10,366 --> 00:22:12,467
There's a second bottle in the cellar.

483
00:22:12,469 --> 00:22:14,635
I'll clean this up.

484
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,646
Finished already?

485
00:22:25,648 --> 00:22:28,216
Perhaps I should offer
you a job on my staff.

486
00:22:32,527 --> 00:22:33,287
Ms. Blaisdel?

487
00:22:34,571 --> 00:22:36,517
The-the door handle seems
to have fallen off in here.

488
00:22:36,552 --> 00:22:38,292
Could you open the door for me, please?

489
00:22:39,496 --> 00:22:40,995
Hello?

490
00:22:41,643 --> 00:22:43,197
Ms. Blaisdel?!

491
00:22:45,713 --> 00:22:46,500
Hello?

492
00:22:48,838 --> 00:22:50,071
Ms. Blaisdel?

493
00:22:50,073 --> 00:22:53,307
Open the door immediately.

494
00:22:53,309 --> 00:22:55,409
Open the door!

495
00:22:55,411 --> 00:22:57,011
What is going on?

496
00:22:57,013 --> 00:22:59,280
What on earth are you doing?

497
00:23:03,753 --> 00:23:05,586
I thought you'd be Sam.

498
00:23:05,588 --> 00:23:08,122
- Have you seen him?
- No.

499
00:23:08,124 --> 00:23:09,857
Well, I asked him
to find Claudia a while ago,

500
00:23:09,859 --> 00:23:11,659
and tried calling him.

501
00:23:11,661 --> 00:23:13,528
Is everything all right?

502
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:15,696
Claudia fired her nurse a week ago.

503
00:23:15,698 --> 00:23:17,398
She lied to me about it.

504
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,666
Why would she do that?

505
00:23:18,668 --> 00:23:20,268
I think Claudia is intentionally

506
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:21,802
taking the wrong pills.

507
00:23:21,804 --> 00:23:23,171
What, like Munchausen's?

508
00:23:23,173 --> 00:23:24,839
Maybe she's trying to hurt the baby?

509
00:23:24,841 --> 00:23:27,175
She said she didn't think
she'd make a good mother,

510
00:23:27,177 --> 00:23:28,509
and that she was scared.

511
00:23:28,511 --> 00:23:31,245
You haven't said any of this to Claudia,
have you? I wouldn't.

512
00:23:31,247 --> 00:23:32,680
Let's just keep a close eye on her

513
00:23:32,682 --> 00:23:35,616
until she's under
professional care tomorrow.

514
00:23:35,618 --> 00:23:37,218
We can make it one more day.

515
00:23:44,594 --> 00:23:46,527
Thank you so much for helping out today.

516
00:23:46,529 --> 00:23:48,462
No, thank you.

517
00:23:48,464 --> 00:23:51,065
I needed a reminder that even
poor people can be happy.

518
00:23:55,632 --> 00:23:58,039
Here...

519
00:23:58,041 --> 00:23:59,707
rich bitch tax.

520
00:23:59,709 --> 00:24:01,576
Hopefully,
this will help with next year.

521
00:24:06,416 --> 00:24:07,615
Oh, my.

522
00:24:07,617 --> 00:24:09,116
Are you sure about this?

523
00:24:09,118 --> 00:24:11,419
Hey, what'd you make?

524
00:24:11,421 --> 00:24:13,788
- A catapult.
- Wow.

525
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:15,423
Where'd you learn to make that?

526
00:24:15,425 --> 00:24:16,424
YouTube.

527
00:24:16,426 --> 00:24:17,959
I'm going to be an architect.

528
00:24:17,961 --> 00:24:19,527
Well, that's the work of an engineer,

529
00:24:19,529 --> 00:24:21,462
which is way cooler than an architect.

530
00:24:21,464 --> 00:24:23,297
It's what I wanted to
be when I was a kid.

531
00:24:23,299 --> 00:24:24,298
Are you one?

532
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:25,299
Oh, God, no.

533
00:24:25,301 --> 00:24:26,434
Because you're a girl?

534
00:24:26,436 --> 00:24:28,536
No. Because my dad told me

535
00:24:28,538 --> 00:24:30,504
that engineers always
work for someone else.

536
00:24:31,277 --> 00:24:33,341
The point is,
you can be anything you want to be.

537
00:24:33,343 --> 00:24:34,875
There are plenty of girl engineers.

538
00:24:47,523 --> 00:24:49,991
Claudia.

539
00:24:51,094 --> 00:24:52,059
Claudia?

540
00:24:52,061 --> 00:24:54,996
- Yeah?
- Where have you been?

541
00:24:54,998 --> 00:24:57,198
I've been getting ready for dinner.

542
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,500
Oh. Well, you look nice.

543
00:24:59,502 --> 00:25:01,669
- Thank you.
- Have you seen Sam?

544
00:25:01,671 --> 00:25:02,903
I thought he was with you.

545
00:25:02,905 --> 00:25:04,572
I mean, you were together earlier,
weren't you,

546
00:25:04,574 --> 00:25:05,673
talking about my pills?

547
00:25:07,163 --> 00:25:08,242
I thought you were napping.

548
00:25:08,244 --> 00:25:09,677
Did you figure it out, at least...

549
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:10,978
what happened with the pills?

550
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:15,483
Why don't we talk about that later?

551
00:25:15,485 --> 00:25:16,717
It's almost time for dinner.

552
00:25:16,719 --> 00:25:20,288
You're a smart woman, Cristal.

553
00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:22,690
And surely you figured it out by now.

554
00:25:22,692 --> 00:25:24,558
I mean, really,

555
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,861
who else could have done it?

556
00:25:28,531 --> 00:25:30,965
I guess you shouldn't
have brought me here.

557
00:25:30,967 --> 00:25:34,035
I guess this is what you get
when you bring home strays.

558
00:25:35,393 --> 00:25:36,337
You're not sick, are you?

559
00:25:37,569 --> 00:25:38,873
Just sick of<i> you.</i>

560
00:25:38,875 --> 00:25:41,008
But no,

561
00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:42,643
I haven't needed those
pills in a long time.

562
00:25:42,645 --> 00:25:44,478
Well, except the benzos.

563
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:48,049
They keep me just numb enough
to tolerate you people.

564
00:25:48,051 --> 00:25:49,450
I'm getting Blake.

565
00:25:49,452 --> 00:25:51,218
Sit down.

566
00:25:52,176 --> 00:25:54,622
You warn anyone,
and your new family dies.

567
00:25:55,872 --> 00:25:57,558
Claudia...

568
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,627
please, give me the gun.

569
00:25:59,629 --> 00:26:02,930
Like you said,
it's almost time for dinner.

570
00:26:02,932 --> 00:26:06,233
And I'm gonna give you all
something to be grateful for.

571
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:26,683
Hello? Anyone out there?

572
00:26:26,685 --> 00:26:28,919
- Hello?
- Yes, hello, I'm here.

573
00:26:28,921 --> 00:26:30,087
Who's that?

574
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:31,188
It's Sam.

575
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:33,557
Of course it is.

576
00:26:33,559 --> 00:26:34,958
I'm in the wine cellar.

577
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,661
I'm in the gun room. Can you let me out?

578
00:26:37,663 --> 00:26:39,830
Well, of course
I can't let you out. I'm...

579
00:26:40,966 --> 00:26:43,033
Did Claudia trap you, too?

580
00:26:43,035 --> 00:26:44,548
She clocked me in the head with a gun.

581
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:46,703
She has a gun?

582
00:26:46,705 --> 00:26:48,371
Sam, we need to get out of here.

583
00:26:48,373 --> 00:26:49,303
Well, what am I supposed to do?

584
00:26:49,309 --> 00:26:51,871
Well, grab a pistol
and shoot the lock off.

585
00:26:51,911 --> 00:26:53,586
Hey, don't stereotype me, Anders.

586
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:55,253
I'm not some kind of gangster.

587
00:26:55,347 --> 00:26:56,646
I don't know how to use a gun.

588
00:26:56,648 --> 00:26:59,783
I'm pretty good
at picking locks, though,

589
00:26:59,785 --> 00:27:02,853
if I had a card,
but my wallet's upstairs.

590
00:27:02,855 --> 00:27:04,688
Hang on.

591
00:27:05,924 --> 00:27:08,024
Here, try this.

592
00:27:12,941 --> 00:27:15,665
Nice picture. And your hair?

593
00:27:15,667 --> 00:27:17,267
You used to have all the hair.

594
00:27:17,269 --> 00:27:18,602
Get on with it!

595
00:27:21,407 --> 00:27:22,807
Anyone seen Sam?

596
00:27:23,194 --> 00:27:25,909
Not for a while.
I'm sure he'll be here soon.

597
00:27:27,413 --> 00:27:29,880
Well, doesn't this table look amazing?

598
00:27:29,882 --> 00:27:31,482
We just need Anders to pour the wine.

599
00:27:31,484 --> 00:27:32,983
Anders?

600
00:27:32,985 --> 00:27:35,786
And, of course,
I'll take my seat, darling.

601
00:27:39,458 --> 00:27:42,008
Honey, it's 2017.

602
00:27:42,043 --> 00:27:43,260
A woman can sit at
the head of the table,

603
00:27:43,262 --> 00:27:44,928
can't she?

604
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:46,697
Of course.

605
00:27:46,699 --> 00:27:48,432
But that seat is where my father sat

606
00:27:48,434 --> 00:27:50,033
and carved the turkey
every Thanksgiving,

607
00:27:50,035 --> 00:27:51,401
and where I've done the same.

608
00:27:51,403 --> 00:27:53,492
And what's Thanksgiving
without tradition?

609
00:27:53,527 --> 00:27:57,025
Football and pumpkin pie
and sitting in my seat.

610
00:27:57,043 --> 00:27:58,842
Blake, sit down.

611
00:27:58,844 --> 00:28:01,612
You picked a fine day to ride
your feminist high horse.

612
00:28:01,614 --> 00:28:02,813
Live a little, Dad.

613
00:28:02,815 --> 00:28:04,147
Or are you so set in your ways

614
00:28:04,149 --> 00:28:05,616
that you have to control
every little detail...

615
00:28:05,618 --> 00:28:08,151
Oh, okay, idealist,

616
00:28:08,153 --> 00:28:10,254
what's the clear right and wrong here?

617
00:28:10,256 --> 00:28:12,489
Pretty clear I should have
gone to dinner with Fallon.

618
00:28:12,491 --> 00:28:13,757
Well, maybe you should have.

619
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:15,626
Blake, just sit down.

620
00:28:16,862 --> 00:28:18,228
I think you should listen

621
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:20,731
to the lady at the head
of the table, Blake.

622
00:28:24,203 --> 00:28:26,036
Oh, uh...

623
00:28:26,931 --> 00:28:28,138
Claudia...

624
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:30,340
easy now... What's going on?

625
00:28:30,342 --> 00:28:31,909
Whatever it is, we can talk about it.

626
00:28:31,911 --> 00:28:34,111
That's a great idea.

627
00:28:34,113 --> 00:28:36,313
And since we're all about tradition,

628
00:28:36,315 --> 00:28:38,582
why don't we go around and
say what we're grateful for?

629
00:28:39,937 --> 00:28:41,118
No takers?

630
00:28:41,662 --> 00:28:42,719
I'll go.

631
00:28:43,405 --> 00:28:46,189
I'm grateful for my husband.

632
00:28:46,191 --> 00:28:48,058
Oh, no, wait, he's dead.

633
00:28:49,228 --> 00:28:51,929
I'm grateful for my friends, like Willy.

634
00:28:52,804 --> 00:28:55,365
Oh, no, he's dead, too.

635
00:28:55,367 --> 00:28:56,867
I'm grateful for my baby,

636
00:28:56,869 --> 00:28:58,635
whose father is dead.

637
00:28:58,637 --> 00:29:00,103
So now I'm just repeating myself.

638
00:29:00,105 --> 00:29:02,039
- Claudia...
- Turns out that I only have

639
00:29:02,041 --> 00:29:03,273
one thing to be grateful for,

640
00:29:03,275 --> 00:29:05,142
and that's being here in the home

641
00:29:05,144 --> 00:29:06,677
of the people responsible

642
00:29:06,679 --> 00:29:09,212
for ruining my life,

643
00:29:09,214 --> 00:29:12,115
so I can ruin yours.

644
00:29:12,117 --> 00:29:13,817
Now, sit the hell down.

645
00:29:13,819 --> 00:29:16,286
Will you please move it along?

646
00:29:16,288 --> 00:29:18,255
Shh! Be quiet,
I'm trying to concentrate.

647
00:29:18,257 --> 00:29:19,923
Well, I can understand
why your gang of thieves

648
00:29:19,925 --> 00:29:21,959
kicked you out...
You're terrible at this!

649
00:29:21,961 --> 00:29:23,560
Hey, you keep nagging,
old man, and I'm gonna tell

650
00:29:23,562 --> 00:29:25,796
the whole staff your
middle name is Winifred.

651
00:29:26,692 --> 00:29:27,998
How did you know that?

652
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,567
Your license. Now, quiet, Winnie.

653
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:36,807
I know I didn't

654
00:29:36,809 --> 00:29:40,143
get an invite, but I'm here
whether you like it or not.

655
00:29:40,939 --> 00:29:42,245
- And we need to talk.
- Get the hell out.

656
00:29:42,247 --> 00:29:43,714
- Go away, Fallon. - Go away, Fallon!
- Don't come in here.

657
00:29:43,716 --> 00:29:46,717
Screw you. I'm not going anywhere.

658
00:29:46,719 --> 00:29:48,585
I need to talk to you
about the C-R-A-Z...

659
00:29:48,587 --> 00:29:50,954
Why does the crazy lady have a gun?

660
00:29:50,956 --> 00:29:52,089
She's not crazy.

661
00:29:52,091 --> 00:29:53,824
She's been faking her brain injury.

662
00:29:54,704 --> 00:29:57,194
Why fake such a miserable life?

663
00:29:57,196 --> 00:29:59,196
Actually, that's a rhetorical question.

664
00:29:59,198 --> 00:30:00,764
I think I know exactly why.

665
00:30:00,766 --> 00:30:03,433
- I think you've been faking lots of things.
- Sit down.

666
00:30:03,435 --> 00:30:04,935
You never had a brain injury,
did you, Claudia?

667
00:30:04,937 --> 00:30:06,203
- Of course I did. I almost died.
- It's true.

668
00:30:06,205 --> 00:30:08,105
She and Matthew were in
a terrible car accident.

669
00:30:08,107 --> 00:30:09,139
I remember it.

670
00:30:09,141 --> 00:30:10,374
I bet.

671
00:30:10,376 --> 00:30:11,975
That was the night that I found out

672
00:30:11,977 --> 00:30:13,176
that he was cheating on me.

673
00:30:13,178 --> 00:30:14,544
I just didn't know who
the other woman was.

674
00:30:14,546 --> 00:30:17,581
All you knew is that one minute
your husband was cheating,

675
00:30:17,583 --> 00:30:18,849
the next, he wasn't going anywhere

676
00:30:18,851 --> 00:30:20,283
because he had to take care of you.

677
00:30:20,285 --> 00:30:21,351
And then, when you got better...

678
00:30:21,353 --> 00:30:22,486
You lied.

679
00:30:22,488 --> 00:30:25,255
You pretended to be sick
so that he would stay.

680
00:30:25,257 --> 00:30:26,456
You know, there's a thin line

681
00:30:26,458 --> 00:30:29,359
between true love and truly psycho.

682
00:30:29,361 --> 00:30:30,427
Fallon...

683
00:30:30,429 --> 00:30:31,795
You realize she has a loaded gun?

684
00:30:31,797 --> 00:30:33,430
And I have the loaded question.

685
00:30:33,432 --> 00:30:36,033
Why keep faking it
after Matthew's death?

686
00:30:36,035 --> 00:30:38,402
Because it's the perfect alibi.

687
00:30:38,404 --> 00:30:40,904
- What are you saying?
- No one suspects a brain-injured widow.

688
00:30:40,906 --> 00:30:42,472
They only look at people like Willy.

689
00:30:42,474 --> 00:30:44,207
- Willy confessed.
- Unless he didn't.

690
00:30:44,209 --> 00:30:46,143
The thumper truck
was rigged by an engineer.

691
00:30:46,145 --> 00:30:47,611
Brain injury or no, how could...

692
00:30:47,613 --> 00:30:49,513
Girls can be engineers, too, Dad.

693
00:30:49,515 --> 00:30:51,281
When I was a kid,
I told you I wanted to be one,

694
00:30:51,283 --> 00:30:53,550
so you introduced me to Matthew,

695
00:30:53,552 --> 00:30:55,318
who told me his wife was an engineer.

696
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,387
That was before your accident,
of course.

697
00:30:57,389 --> 00:30:59,923
You killed him. You killed Matthew.

698
00:30:59,925 --> 00:31:03,326
No, I loved him. You killed him.

699
00:31:03,328 --> 00:31:05,499
He told me he was leaving
me even though I was sick.

700
00:31:05,598 --> 00:31:06,466
Even though you were faking it.

701
00:31:06,499 --> 00:31:07,669
He didn't know that.

702
00:31:07,867 --> 00:31:09,270
You took him from me.

703
00:31:09,302 --> 00:31:11,301
And once this snake ran me over,

704
00:31:11,303 --> 00:31:13,003
I saw my chance to do
something about it...

705
00:31:13,005 --> 00:31:15,338
to insinuate myself inside this home...

706
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:17,007
Claudia, if you hurt her...

707
00:31:17,009 --> 00:31:19,142
Oh, no, no, no.
I'm not gonna shoot her, Blake.

708
00:31:19,144 --> 00:31:20,677
No, I want her to suffer

709
00:31:20,679 --> 00:31:23,113
the same pain that she caused me.

710
00:31:24,216 --> 00:31:27,784
I wanted to seduce her husband,
just like she did mine.

711
00:31:27,786 --> 00:31:30,020
That was only part of the plan.

712
00:31:30,022 --> 00:31:32,556
- The kicker was when I kill him.
- No.

713
00:31:32,558 --> 00:31:34,224
Oh, oh, oh, oh!
You finally are getting a taste

714
00:31:34,226 --> 00:31:35,358
of your own medicine.

715
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,027
When the loss is so bitter

716
00:31:37,029 --> 00:31:39,296
that you cough and choke on it,

717
00:31:39,298 --> 00:31:41,264
just remember
that you did it to me, too.

718
00:31:41,266 --> 00:31:42,999
Don't worry, Daddy.

719
00:31:43,001 --> 00:31:45,035
That's the gun that Mom got
me for my 16th birthday.

720
00:31:45,037 --> 00:31:46,737
The firing pin hasn't worked in years.

721
00:31:46,739 --> 00:31:47,838
I think we're done now.

722
00:31:51,945 --> 00:31:52,909
Got it!

723
00:31:54,747 --> 00:31:56,847
Good Lord, took you long enough.

724
00:32:02,102 --> 00:32:03,954
Oh, you must be joking.

725
00:32:05,124 --> 00:32:06,790
I guess the gun does work.

726
00:32:06,792 --> 00:32:08,692
Anders had it fixed.

727
00:32:08,694 --> 00:32:10,127
Where is Anders?

728
00:32:10,129 --> 00:32:13,130
- Where's Sam?
- Everyone sit down!

729
00:32:14,233 --> 00:32:15,866
I'm sorry.

730
00:32:15,868 --> 00:32:17,734
- What?
- I'm sorry

731
00:32:17,736 --> 00:32:18,869
my family is so screwed up.

732
00:32:18,871 --> 00:32:21,071
I mean, if my dad had believed Steven

733
00:32:21,073 --> 00:32:22,305
about the whole Willy thing,

734
00:32:22,307 --> 00:32:24,074
if Participation Trophy Wife over here

735
00:32:24,076 --> 00:32:26,409
had been honest about Matthew,
maybe this

736
00:32:26,411 --> 00:32:28,912
Norman Rockwell holiday wouldn't
have turned so Norman Bates.

737
00:32:28,914 --> 00:32:31,782
But I was born into this dysfunction.

738
00:32:31,784 --> 00:32:33,216
You didn't have a choice.

739
00:32:33,218 --> 00:32:35,752
Matthew chose Carrington Atlantic.

740
00:32:35,754 --> 00:32:37,454
He chose Cristal.

741
00:32:38,308 --> 00:32:39,956
What choice did you have?

742
00:32:42,628 --> 00:32:44,895
I didn't want to kill Matthew.

743
00:32:44,897 --> 00:32:47,430
- I just wanted to hurt him.
- I know.

744
00:32:48,443 --> 00:32:50,667
But if you pull that trigger,
another life ends.

745
00:32:50,669 --> 00:32:52,135
Not just one of ours;

746
00:32:52,137 --> 00:32:54,037
yours, too.

747
00:32:54,039 --> 00:32:55,105
And the baby's.

748
00:32:55,107 --> 00:32:57,140
If you walk away now,

749
00:32:57,142 --> 00:32:59,476
all you shot is a dead bird.

750
00:33:05,884 --> 00:33:08,618
How do I know I can trust any of you?

751
00:33:09,691 --> 00:33:11,421
A fair question.

752
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:19,062
Claudia, don't!

753
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:26,670
I got it.

754
00:33:29,355 --> 00:33:30,640
Just in time.

755
00:33:31,546 --> 00:33:32,843
The turkey's done.

756
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:38,249
Call me after you get her checked in.
I'll tell Stansfield

757
00:33:38,251 --> 00:33:40,525
- to meet you there.
- You can't just cart me out of here.

758
00:33:40,587 --> 00:33:43,020
Believe me, you would rather go
to a sanitarium than death row.

759
00:33:43,022 --> 00:33:44,121
And you should be thanking us,

760
00:33:44,123 --> 00:33:45,689
after everything you
put my family through.

761
00:33:45,691 --> 00:33:48,058
What about what you've done?
What about Willy?

762
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:50,160
For all we know, you killed him, too,

763
00:33:50,162 --> 00:33:51,362
and planted that note as cover.

764
00:33:52,026 --> 00:33:52,897
You Carringtons

765
00:33:52,899 --> 00:33:54,614
really believe you can
get away with anything.

766
00:33:54,667 --> 00:33:56,066
Get her out of here.

767
00:34:05,278 --> 00:34:07,611
What are you doing?

768
00:34:07,613 --> 00:34:09,546
Her fate isn't up to us.

769
00:34:09,548 --> 00:34:11,782
You can't make a plea
deal in the living room.

770
00:34:11,784 --> 00:34:13,951
I'm going to my study to call
Stansfield, and he'll handle it.

771
00:34:13,953 --> 00:34:14,919
Like he handled Willy?

772
00:34:14,921 --> 00:34:17,354
You know I'm right now.

773
00:34:17,356 --> 00:34:18,756
Willy didn't kill himself. And Claudia

774
00:34:18,758 --> 00:34:20,557
didn't do it. So who else could've

775
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:22,493
planted that confession
note except Stansfield?

776
00:34:22,495 --> 00:34:24,995
I didn't have anything to do with it.

777
00:34:24,997 --> 00:34:26,931
I'm not saying you did.

778
00:34:26,933 --> 00:34:29,133
I'm the one who made
a deal with the devil.

779
00:34:29,135 --> 00:34:31,101
Stop with the good and evil, Steven.

780
00:34:31,103 --> 00:34:32,569
No, that's exactly what this is.

781
00:34:32,571 --> 00:34:34,672
A choice between right and wrong.

782
00:34:34,674 --> 00:34:36,573
And if you call Stansfield,

783
00:34:36,575 --> 00:34:39,977
you're forcing me to choose
between right and you.

784
00:34:52,625 --> 00:34:54,825
Staying for dinner?

785
00:34:54,827 --> 00:34:56,627
I'd say I've earned it.

786
00:34:56,629 --> 00:34:59,063
Well, I'd say so, too, Fallon.

787
00:34:59,065 --> 00:35:01,532
I hope you know that I
wanted you here today,

788
00:35:01,534 --> 00:35:03,667
that I never needed an apology.

789
00:35:04,427 --> 00:35:05,135
Perfect.

790
00:35:06,518 --> 00:35:09,139
You'd take a bullet for your dad,
and so would I.

791
00:35:09,141 --> 00:35:10,708
Call it even?

792
00:35:11,955 --> 00:35:14,611
Even is strong.

793
00:35:19,413 --> 00:35:20,818
We just made up.

794
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:22,386
I think.

795
00:35:22,388 --> 00:35:24,288
Now it's your turn.

796
00:35:34,567 --> 00:35:36,333
Not exactly traditional.

797
00:35:36,335 --> 00:35:37,968
Well, the turkey's still in the kitchen.

798
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:39,436
Could probably eat around the bullet.

799
00:35:39,438 --> 00:35:42,006
On the other hand,
maybe a few new traditions

800
00:35:42,008 --> 00:35:43,474
wouldn't exactly hurt us.

801
00:35:43,476 --> 00:35:44,908
"Us"?

802
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:46,477
Am I back in the family?

803
00:35:46,479 --> 00:35:48,479
I might've said a few
things this morning

804
00:35:48,481 --> 00:35:49,847
that were a little harsh.

805
00:35:49,849 --> 00:35:51,849
Well, I guess I did, too.

806
00:35:51,851 --> 00:35:53,817
Like father, like daughter.

807
00:35:53,819 --> 00:35:55,386
And for the record,

808
00:35:55,388 --> 00:35:59,023
there's nothing that
you could ever say or do

809
00:35:59,025 --> 00:36:01,291
that could jeopardize
your place in this family.

810
00:36:01,293 --> 00:36:03,761
Okay, you don't have to threaten me.

811
00:36:04,554 --> 00:36:05,596
We missed you, Fallon.

812
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:08,098
You belong here.

813
00:36:08,934 --> 00:36:10,567
Please, come home.

814
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,773
Hey, Jeff, it's Steven.

815
00:36:15,775 --> 00:36:18,442
Oh. Hey.

816
00:36:18,444 --> 00:36:21,512
Sorry to interrupt your holiday,
but I'm about to right a wrong,

817
00:36:21,514 --> 00:36:24,715
and your skills and
resources could help.

818
00:36:24,717 --> 00:36:27,384
You know hacking
isn't my game anymore, right?

819
00:36:27,386 --> 00:36:29,520
I'm going after the police chief,
Stansfield.

820
00:36:29,522 --> 00:36:30,940
Blake's pocket cop?

821
00:36:31,557 --> 00:36:33,824
Same guy who interrogated me?

822
00:36:33,826 --> 00:36:35,626
I'm down to hear more.

823
00:36:35,628 --> 00:36:36,927
Great. Thanks.

824
00:36:36,929 --> 00:36:38,629
We'll connect when you're
back from the Bahamas.

825
00:36:38,631 --> 00:36:39,730
You got it.

826
00:36:48,474 --> 00:36:50,441
I'm here to see my father.

827
00:36:50,443 --> 00:36:52,409
Prisoner 2F529.

828
00:36:53,746 --> 00:36:56,880
Cecil Colby.

829
00:37:02,121 --> 00:37:03,253
Fallon.

830
00:37:06,671 --> 00:37:08,158
Didn't stay at the parents'?

831
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,560
Or at Kori's?

832
00:37:09,562 --> 00:37:12,796
Well, I heard about all the fun
that was going on here, so...

833
00:37:12,798 --> 00:37:14,832
I'm glad everyone's okay.

834
00:37:16,769 --> 00:37:19,970
Mom's famous sweet potato pie.

835
00:37:20,679 --> 00:37:22,606
She was glad to meet
one of my coworkers,

836
00:37:22,608 --> 00:37:24,942
- finally.
- You know,

837
00:37:24,944 --> 00:37:27,177
I figured you had the perfect
relationship with your parents,

838
00:37:27,179 --> 00:37:28,712
like normal people.

839
00:37:28,714 --> 00:37:30,114
Yeah, I wish that were true.

840
00:37:30,116 --> 00:37:31,548
Yeah, me, too.

841
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:33,550
But the other part, you know,

842
00:37:33,552 --> 00:37:36,954
supporting them and how
you feel about it all,

843
00:37:36,956 --> 00:37:38,055
it's heavy.

844
00:37:39,332 --> 00:37:41,024
And it bothers me that I didn't know.

845
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:44,094
And it's my fault, because, you know...

846
00:37:44,096 --> 00:37:46,029
well, I'm mostly about me.

847
00:37:46,031 --> 00:37:48,065
No, this one's not on you, Fallon.

848
00:37:50,136 --> 00:37:52,136
This one's on me.

849
00:37:53,602 --> 00:37:56,140
I should've never lied to you,

850
00:37:56,142 --> 00:37:57,841
and used your family like that.

851
00:37:57,843 --> 00:38:00,043
It's okay. I forgive you.

852
00:38:01,378 --> 00:38:02,646
So...

853
00:38:02,648 --> 00:38:04,481
dinner with Kori but...

854
00:38:04,483 --> 00:38:06,083
maybe dessert back here?

855
00:38:06,085 --> 00:38:08,452
Mm... not like that.

856
00:38:09,768 --> 00:38:12,489
But I'll never turn down another
bite of that sweet potato pie.

857
00:38:13,122 --> 00:38:15,058
Sounds good.

858
00:38:22,394 --> 00:38:24,201
I was looking for you.

859
00:38:24,203 --> 00:38:26,970
It's a powerful thing,
staring down the barrel of a gun.

860
00:38:26,972 --> 00:38:28,568
Kind of adjusts your perspective.

861
00:38:28,641 --> 00:38:30,741
Makes us appreciate what we have.

862
00:38:30,743 --> 00:38:33,010
Makes me want more of what we have.

863
00:38:33,012 --> 00:38:34,878
Let's not get greedy.

864
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:37,214
I mean family.

865
00:38:37,216 --> 00:38:39,049
I think we should have a kid.

866
00:38:39,051 --> 00:38:40,517
Wow.

867
00:38:40,519 --> 00:38:42,653
Okay.

868
00:38:43,731 --> 00:38:45,856
Do you think it's the
right time for that?

869
00:38:45,858 --> 00:38:47,391
Is there a better time?

870
00:38:47,393 --> 00:38:49,893
All this tragedy with Matthew,
Willy, Claudia...

871
00:38:49,895 --> 00:38:51,061
it's all over.

872
00:38:51,063 --> 00:38:54,364
This is our chance to
put everything behind us,

873
00:38:54,366 --> 00:38:56,166
start something new.

874
00:38:57,593 --> 00:38:58,802
What do you think?

875
00:39:01,006 --> 00:39:03,207
You're right.

876
00:39:06,358 --> 00:39:09,112
Let's put the past behind us.
