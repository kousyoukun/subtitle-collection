1
00:02:05,251 --> 00:02:07,446
Aren't you going to work today?

2
00:02:07,553 --> 00:02:11,683
Why should I?
Everybody sees me as a lounge lizard.

3
00:02:11,791 --> 00:02:14,760
Well, terrific.
I'll lounge a while more.

4
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:17,124
And then I think I'll go shopping.

5
00:02:17,229 --> 00:02:20,790
Yeah, that's what I'll do.
I'll send the bill to Blake Carrington.

6
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,800
<i>Or maybe to you.</i>

7
00:02:22,902 --> 00:02:26,736
I've got the name.
I might as well enjoy the game, huh?

8
00:02:28,107 --> 00:02:31,099
My car's in the repair shop.
Again?

9
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:33,371
Again.
I'm expected at the Patricks'.

10
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:36,107
I'd appreciate you getting your act together
getting shaved, dressed

11
00:02:36,215 --> 00:02:38,115
and dropping me off.

12
00:02:38,217 --> 00:02:40,981
Let Michael take you.
Michael's busy.

13
00:02:41,087 --> 00:02:43,055
Borrow Krystle's car.

14
00:02:47,059 --> 00:02:50,028
Well, what happened
to the Denver taxi fleet?

15
00:02:50,129 --> 00:02:53,656
Are none of the drivers cute enough for you?
Cute.

16
00:02:53,766 --> 00:02:56,234
You're the one who's so damn cute,Jeff,
the other night.

17
00:02:56,335 --> 00:02:58,803
Ah, at last. The other night.

18
00:02:58,904 --> 00:03:01,498
<i>Yeah,you werejust about as cute
as you could be, weren't you?</i>

19
00:03:01,607 --> 00:03:04,735
You embarrassed me,
you embarrassed my father...

20
00:03:04,844 --> 00:03:07,039
you embarrassed your uncle.

21
00:03:07,146 --> 00:03:09,842
Messing around with his date?

22
00:03:09,949 --> 00:03:12,179
That's not like you,Jeff.

23
00:03:12,284 --> 00:03:14,275
You know,
he really liked that girl.

24
00:03:14,387 --> 00:03:17,151
Did you get that much satisfaction
in hurting him like that?

25
00:03:17,256 --> 00:03:19,247
Did I really?

26
00:03:19,358 --> 00:03:22,987
Well, that was probably the first time
in 40 years anyone's managed that.

27
00:03:23,095 --> 00:03:25,620
And you know what?
I'm glad it was me.

28
00:03:25,731 --> 00:03:28,199
Well, I always was a late bloomer...

29
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:30,359
but I'm tryin'.

30
00:03:30,469 --> 00:03:32,801
<i>Okay. You made your point.</i>

31
00:03:32,905 --> 00:03:35,373
You showed everybody
what a tough guy you are.

32
00:03:35,474 --> 00:03:39,604
<i>Now, why don't you drop the Bogart act
and get your clothes on?</i>

33
00:03:39,712 --> 00:03:43,671
I married you, didn't I?
That's what you wanted, isn't it?

34
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:51,613
You knew what you were getting into.
Nobody kept any secrets from you.

35
00:03:53,192 --> 00:03:55,160
You're standing in my sun.

36
00:03:56,729 --> 00:03:59,254
One thing about us lizards

37
00:03:59,365 --> 00:04:02,334
we like the sun and quiet.

38
00:04:02,435 --> 00:04:05,199
We're like those iguanas
down in the Galapagos.

39
00:04:05,304 --> 00:04:08,398
Give us a clear sky, the sound of the wind,
kelp to nibble on...

40
00:04:08,507 --> 00:04:10,407
and we're happy.

41
00:04:10,509 --> 00:04:12,477
What we don't like are shrikes.

42
00:04:12,578 --> 00:04:15,206
You know what shrikes are?
Let go of me.

43
00:04:15,314 --> 00:04:17,509
They're little,
pretty birds who devour.

44
00:04:17,616 --> 00:04:20,084
They swoop down and devour
everything they can.

45
00:04:20,186 --> 00:04:23,155
Everything,
including their husbands.

46
00:04:23,255 --> 00:04:26,520
If they happen to have been perverse enough
to have married an iguana...

47
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:30,391
they try to devour the iguana.

48
00:04:32,698 --> 00:04:35,325
Jeff, don't you dare!

49
00:04:37,369 --> 00:04:39,735
Oh! Oh!

50
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:42,437
You come back here!

51
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:46,074
You're gonna be sorry for this!

52
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,518
I thought I was being stood up.

53
00:04:57,623 --> 00:04:59,716
Would you have been disappointed?

54
00:04:59,825 --> 00:05:03,625
Well, I was almost hoping
that you wouldn't show.

55
00:05:03,729 --> 00:05:06,698
Would you rather I went back?
No, I would not.

56
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:11,395
Thanks.
The mattre d' was very concerned.

57
00:05:11,504 --> 00:05:16,066
He said, ""Are you sure that Mr. Carrington
had a luncheon reservation?''

58
00:05:17,943 --> 00:05:21,174
Here. It came in.

59
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,579
<i>Geophysics Potential and Projection
for the '80s.</i>

60
00:05:29,321 --> 00:05:32,256
Aren't you going to open it?

61
00:05:32,358 --> 00:05:34,986
Steven, what's wrong?

62
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:40,430
I was with Ted last night.

63
00:05:41,767 --> 00:05:43,792
<i>He came in from New York
unexpectedly.</i>

64
00:05:43,903 --> 00:05:46,531
I mean, I didn't even know
he was coming in.

65
00:05:48,307 --> 00:05:50,275
We spent the night together.

66
00:05:50,376 --> 00:05:54,642
<i>It wasn't something that I wanted to happen.
IItjust happened.</i>

67
00:05:56,382 --> 00:06:00,842
We were sitting there,
talking about the old days.

68
00:06:09,995 --> 00:06:11,963
Please, don't go.

69
00:06:13,799 --> 00:06:16,597
Why not?
'Cause I don't want you to.

70
00:06:16,702 --> 00:06:19,694
Is he still here?
Yes.

71
00:06:19,805 --> 00:06:21,705
Then why should I stay?

72
00:06:23,142 --> 00:06:25,610
Because I've got to
explain this to you.

73
00:06:25,711 --> 00:06:28,839
But how can you? I mean,
can you even explain it to yourself?

74
00:06:28,948 --> 00:06:31,439
Because I don't understand it.

75
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:36,317
You've gotta know that things
aren't that clearcut in life.

76
00:06:36,422 --> 00:06:39,323
You love Matthew, you love me.

77
00:06:39,425 --> 00:06:41,552
I love you...

78
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:44,390
and I spent the night with somebody...

79
00:06:44,496 --> 00:06:46,464
who's very

80
00:06:53,305 --> 00:06:56,103
Claudia, I'm fighting too.

81
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:58,972
It's not that easy for me,
where I am right now, either.

82
00:07:03,382 --> 00:07:05,680
When will I see you again?

83
00:07:05,784 --> 00:07:07,684
I don't know.

84
00:07:39,685 --> 00:07:42,813
Bobby, give me
those channel locks, will you?

85
00:07:44,957 --> 00:07:47,755
What the hell's the matter with you?
I said channel locks, not

86
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:50,488
Can I try again?

87
00:07:50,596 --> 00:07:52,564
What are you doing out here?

88
00:07:52,665 --> 00:07:56,362
I just needed to see you, that's all.

89
00:07:56,468 --> 00:08:00,427
You drove out here just to see
your old man covered in grease and smut?

90
00:08:00,539 --> 00:08:02,439
Mmhmm.

91
00:08:04,743 --> 00:08:06,973
Hey.

92
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,771
You're gonna get this stuff
all over you.

93
00:08:10,916 --> 00:08:13,316
I don't care.

94
00:08:13,419 --> 00:08:16,286
I just need to be close to you.

95
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:24,029
Want to go for a walk?

96
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:26,029
Hmm.

97
00:08:35,341 --> 00:08:39,368
Uh, are you gonna tell me
what's on your mind...

98
00:08:39,478 --> 00:08:43,175
or do I have to take you
up to that rig...

99
00:08:43,282 --> 00:08:46,740
and hold you upside down
by your pretty ankles till you do?

100
00:08:46,852 --> 00:08:48,752
Matthew?

101
00:08:48,854 --> 00:08:52,085
Do you think we can go someplace?

102
00:08:52,191 --> 00:08:55,388
Tonight?
No, that's not what I mean.

103
00:08:57,463 --> 00:09:00,830
Well, you want to go
up to the lake this weekend?

104
00:09:01,967 --> 00:09:05,266
I wanna go somewhere
far away from here.

105
00:09:05,371 --> 00:09:08,499
Just you and me and Lindsay.

106
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:11,735
Far away.
I just wanna make a fresh start.

107
00:09:14,613 --> 00:09:17,707
Claudia.

108
00:09:20,285 --> 00:09:22,651
Look around you here.

109
00:09:22,755 --> 00:09:25,223
This is the fresh start.

110
00:09:26,892 --> 00:09:28,860
Not for me.

111
00:09:33,499 --> 00:09:37,367
Well, this is what
I came back home for

112
00:09:37,469 --> 00:09:41,462
to build something for us
you, me, Lindsay.

113
00:09:44,143 --> 00:09:47,738
And now it's
it's beginning to work.

114
00:09:47,846 --> 00:09:50,474
I We just can't
walk away from that.

115
00:09:50,582 --> 00:09:54,575
What if I said
it was really important for me?

116
00:09:55,754 --> 00:09:57,654
What would you do?

117
00:10:00,325 --> 00:10:02,520
Claudia.

118
00:10:02,628 --> 00:10:05,859
What are you trying
to run away from?

119
00:10:05,964 --> 00:10:07,932
I mean...

120
00:10:09,768 --> 00:10:12,236
the last time I went through this...

121
00:10:12,337 --> 00:10:15,067
it was demons and bats...

122
00:10:15,174 --> 00:10:19,406
and... people listening in
on your conversations.

123
00:10:19,511 --> 00:10:21,979
I'm not getting sick again.
I'm really not.

124
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,378
That's not what you have to worry about.

125
00:10:24,483 --> 00:10:28,442
Then I have to answer ""no,''
because you're not making any sense.

126
00:10:28,554 --> 00:10:31,022
Isn't it enough that I just asked you?

127
00:10:31,123 --> 00:10:33,091
I mean, isn't that enough, Matthew?

128
00:10:36,161 --> 00:10:38,891
It's not, is it?

129
00:10:38,997 --> 00:10:41,557
I can see that it's not enough.

130
00:10:41,667 --> 00:10:43,567
Claudia?

131
00:10:46,738 --> 00:10:50,834
You came out here to tell me something,
and now you're holding back.

132
00:10:53,145 --> 00:10:55,773
I'll be all right. Don't worry.
I'll be fine.

133
00:11:56,808 --> 00:11:59,504
This is our first stop.
I'll wait in the car.

134
00:11:59,611 --> 00:12:02,079
No, no, no, no.
Please, come with me.

135
00:12:13,926 --> 00:12:16,520
<i>[ Man ]
An evaluation, as usual.</i>

136
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:48,549
You said you paid $60,000
for this, Mr. Carrington.

137
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:51,151
<i>Yes, that's right.
May I ask where?</i>

138
00:12:51,263 --> 00:12:53,390
At Beauvais.

139
00:12:53,498 --> 00:12:55,966
Oh, yes.

140
00:12:56,068 --> 00:12:58,036
God rest his soul.

141
00:12:58,136 --> 00:13:00,036
Oh, sad, wasn't it?

142
00:13:00,138 --> 00:13:02,663
Yes, yes. Very sad, indeed.

143
00:13:02,774 --> 00:13:06,005
Hmm. Well, now...

144
00:13:06,111 --> 00:13:09,274
you got yourself quite a bargain
with him, didn't you?

145
00:13:09,381 --> 00:13:13,340
<i>Did I?
Oh,yes. Indeed.</i>

146
00:13:13,452 --> 00:13:16,012
<i>I must tell you, as an honest man</i>

147
00:13:16,121 --> 00:13:18,919
You see, I've built my reputation...

148
00:13:19,024 --> 00:13:22,460
on honesty, honesty.

149
00:13:24,896 --> 00:13:28,559
Well, Mr. Channing, how much
would you say that was worth?

150
00:13:28,667 --> 00:13:31,795
Right now, as we speak?
Seventy thousand.

151
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:38,403
Seventy? Hmm.

152
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:40,444
Are you sure?

153
00:13:40,545 --> 00:13:43,537
They are very fine stones.

154
00:13:43,649 --> 00:13:45,708
<i>Perfectly cut.</i>

155
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:50,421
But are you sure?

156
00:13:51,523 --> 00:13:53,491
Oh, the price.

157
00:13:53,592 --> 00:13:55,992
<i>Well, it may be worth more
to some...</i>

158
00:13:56,094 --> 00:13:59,325
but I have to leave a margin for profit,
you understand?

159
00:13:59,464 --> 00:14:01,557
I didn't mean that.

160
00:14:02,868 --> 00:14:05,803
Oh, what did you mean, darling?

161
00:14:24,956 --> 00:14:26,856
Nothing.

162
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,769
May I ask my cashier
to make out a check to you?

163
00:14:39,204 --> 00:14:41,104
No.

164
00:14:41,206 --> 00:14:44,733
Mr. Channing, my wife appears to be
more partial to that necklace...

165
00:14:44,843 --> 00:14:47,107
<i>than I originally thought
she might be.</i>

166
00:14:47,212 --> 00:14:50,648

<i>Thank you very much though
for your trouble.</i>

168
00:15:47,005 --> 00:15:49,303
You're perspiring.

169
00:15:49,407 --> 00:15:51,375
I don't feel very well.

170
00:15:51,476 --> 00:15:54,274
You're tight as a drum.

171
00:15:58,884 --> 00:16:01,853
Mr. Carrington, Mrs. Carrington.

172
00:16:03,655 --> 00:16:07,113
Joseph, would you have a couple of brandies
sent to the library, please?

173
00:16:07,225 --> 00:16:09,693
Of course, Mr. Carrington.
Mrs. Gunnerson.

<i>What is it, Krystle?</i>

176
00:16:36,254 --> 00:16:39,223
You set the whole thing up,
didn't you?

177
00:16:44,262 --> 00:16:46,890
You've known about it all along.

178
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,968
The necklace, the money.

179
00:16:53,705 --> 00:16:57,835
You bought the real necklace back
from Mr. Volkert...

180
00:16:57,943 --> 00:17:01,902
and then you made me go through
the charade of trying to sell it.

181
00:17:05,217 --> 00:17:07,481
Why'd you do it, Blake?

182
00:17:07,586 --> 00:17:09,486
To punish me?

183
00:17:09,588 --> 00:17:12,250
Well, it's all over.

184
00:17:14,059 --> 00:17:17,119
I believe you've learned your lesson.
We can let it pass.

185
00:17:17,229 --> 00:17:19,959
What lesson, for God's sake?

186
00:17:20,065 --> 00:17:22,499
You may think I did something wrong.
I don't.

187
00:17:22,601 --> 00:17:26,867
Oh? Perhaps you'd like me to believe
that Matthew Blaisdel...

188
00:17:26,972 --> 00:17:28,997
<i>should be some sort
of charity of mine...</i>

189
00:17:29,107 --> 00:17:32,873
that he lies somewhere between
the Red Cross and Boys Town.

190
00:17:32,978 --> 00:17:36,937
What is this obsession you have
with destroying Matthew Blaisdel?

191
00:17:37,048 --> 00:17:40,609
I said that it was over.
Let it pass.

192
00:17:40,719 --> 00:17:42,812
It's not over.

193
00:17:42,921 --> 00:17:46,482
<i>It won't be over until I sign
some kind of affidavit...</i>

194
00:17:46,591 --> 00:17:50,254

with Matthew behind your back...

Yes. What is it,Joseph?

202
00:18:09,414 --> 00:18:11,405
You wanted me to remind you.

I don't want it. Thank you.
You can take it away.

Mrs. Carrington,
I don't like your tone of voice...

215

and I don't think that you're in
any position to speak to me that way.

216
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:04,269
What do you mean by that?
You know what I mean.

217
00:19:04,304 --> 00:19:06,601
What do you mean by that?
You know what I mean.

I belong here, you don't.

219

Would you like me to tell
Mr. Carrington you said that?

220
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:18,611
I don't think Mr. Carrington's
all that pleased with you at the moment.

221

I don't think that

Sure. You're in the right place.

00:19:52,917 --> 00:19:56,318
Oh, is, uh is he here?
I'm his father.

227
00:19:58,089 --> 00:20:00,614
Oh, Mr. Carrington.

228
00:20:00,725 --> 00:20:03,819
No, Steven is not home yet.

Please, come in.
Thank you.

Uh, my name's Ted. Ted Dinard.

I'm an old friend of Steven's.
I'm in town for a couple of days.

232
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:20,675
""Dinard.'' Let's see, that's the name
of a town in Brittany, isn't it?

233
00:20:20,779 --> 00:20:23,680
Yeah.
Drove through it once during the war...

234
00:20:23,782 --> 00:20:25,682
about a week after Dday.

235
00:20:25,784 --> 00:20:27,684
Beautiful place.

236
00:20:27,786 --> 00:20:30,414
Yes, uh, on the Emerald Coast,
as the French call it.

237
00:20:30,522 --> 00:20:33,320
It's as green as the Riviera is blue.

So, you're an old friend
of Steven's, huh?

00:20:38,696 --> 00:20:41,494
From New York?
No, from school.

240

Choate?
No, I didn't go to prep school.

241
00:20:44,169 --> 00:20:45,864
But I did go to Princeton.

242
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:50,566
Oh, that's where you two know each other from.
Yes, sir.

243
00:20:50,675 --> 00:20:53,872
I guess that's why we never met.

244
00:20:53,978 --> 00:20:57,345
I was very negligent about visiting
him there, except for graduation.

245
00:20:57,449 --> 00:21:01,476
I did make graduation.
Hectic day.

That's right. Yeah.

Did you live in the same dorm?
No.

Let's see. Where did he live?

250
00:21:17,068 --> 00:21:19,832
Stafford Little, I think.
I wrote to him there.

251
00:21:21,973 --> 00:21:24,032
Yes. Stafford Little Hall.

252
00:21:24,142 --> 00:21:26,906

Interesting man.

258
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:46,394

<i>No, I believe it was Bowen.</i>

Hello, Steven.

00:22:21,166 --> 00:22:24,033
I'll go get dressed. Excuse me.

267
00:22:27,872 --> 00:22:30,807
How'd work go today?
Okay.

268
00:22:30,909 --> 00:22:33,605
I get good reports on you.

269
00:22:34,712 --> 00:22:36,612
I brought you something.

270
00:22:36,714 --> 00:22:39,182
<i>A little housewarming gift.</i>

271
00:22:48,726 --> 00:22:51,593
Obviously, an ice bucket.

00:22:51,696 --> 00:22:54,824
Not so obviously, at least not to me...

273
00:22:54,933 --> 00:22:57,333
I brought you a little brass cricket...

274
00:22:57,435 --> 00:22:59,335
for the hearth.

275
00:22:59,437 --> 00:23:01,337
Means good luck and happiness.

276
00:23:01,439 --> 00:23:04,033

It was Krystle's idea.

Well, thank you, Dad.

278
00:23:06,544 --> 00:23:09,980
And thank her for me.

00:23:10,081 --> 00:23:12,208
Would you like
something to drink?

We have red wine, beer.
Oh, no, thank you. Not right now.

281
00:23:15,853 --> 00:23:20,313
I'm sure you and your friend have got
a lot of old memories to recapture.

282
00:23:20,425 --> 00:23:22,655
I've gotta get going back.

283
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:26,992
If you'd like to come up to the house
for dinner tonight, we'd love to have you.

284
00:23:27,098 --> 00:23:31,364
No. We have plans. We're going
to meet some friends from school.

285
00:23:31,469 --> 00:23:33,369
Princeton?

286
00:23:34,539 --> 00:23:37,599
Yes. I'll be by sometime tomorrow...

287
00:23:37,709 --> 00:23:39,677
pick up the rest of my stuff.

288
00:23:39,777 --> 00:23:42,473
<i>Probably tomorrow night.
Fine.</i>

289
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:46,539
Good luck here, Son.
Very pleasant place that you have.

290
00:23:48,419 --> 00:23:52,378
And, uh, say goodbye
to Ted for me, will you?

291
00:23:53,424 --> 00:23:55,949
Goodbye, Dad.
And thanks again.

292
00:24:20,184 --> 00:24:22,152
Took you long enough.

293
00:24:24,689 --> 00:24:26,623
Can I have the keys?
Here you go.

294
00:24:26,724 --> 00:24:29,454
And there's a message goes with it.
Who from?

295
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,528
Mr. Gruber, the mechanic.

296
00:24:31,629 --> 00:24:34,894
He said to tell you that thing
down there is a transmission...

297
00:24:34,999 --> 00:24:37,126
and not a Mixmaster.

298
00:24:37,235 --> 00:24:40,227
Amusing.
He didn't think so.

299
00:24:40,338 --> 00:24:43,364
A machine like that
is a poem to him...

300
00:24:43,474 --> 00:24:45,374
and to me too.

301
00:24:45,476 --> 00:24:48,274
Any other verses
I should be let in on?

302
00:24:48,379 --> 00:24:50,904
Yeah. You're spoiled rotten.

303
00:24:51,015 --> 00:24:54,781
That's me, not Gruber.
You have no appreciation.

304
00:24:54,886 --> 00:24:57,650
A car like that costs
upwards of $80,000...

305
00:24:57,755 --> 00:25:01,384
and you treat it
like a pickup truck.

306
00:25:01,492 --> 00:25:05,451
But it's something
very, very special...

307
00:25:06,664 --> 00:25:09,792
and to be handled special...

308
00:25:09,901 --> 00:25:11,801
like a woman.

309
00:25:11,903 --> 00:25:13,996
I wouldn't know about that.

310
00:25:16,507 --> 00:25:18,475
Let go of me!

311

00:26:03,821 --> 00:26:05,789
Denver's okay.

316
00:26:07,392 --> 00:26:10,088
I mean it. Denver's really okay.

317
00:26:11,295 --> 00:26:13,286
Don't you miss New York, Steven?

318
00:26:13,398 --> 00:26:16,196
Sometimes.

319
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:19,098
Okay, which way to the opera?

320
00:26:19,203 --> 00:26:21,103
What?

321
00:26:21,205 --> 00:26:24,231
Opera.
You know, like in the Met?

322
00:26:24,342 --> 00:26:26,970
Like that time last year
when we sat in the dress circle...

323
00:26:27,078 --> 00:26:29,546
and watched Pavarotti
belt out those nine high C's?

324
00:26:29,647 --> 00:26:33,811
We cheered and yelled, made ourselves hoarse
while he's standing out there bowing away?

325
00:26:33,918 --> 00:26:36,887
Remember that night, Steven?
Yeah, I do.

326
00:26:40,691 --> 00:26:43,990
Well, at least they have ""talking picture''
theaters here in Denver.

327
00:26:44,095 --> 00:26:45,995
Want to take in a film?

328
00:26:46,097 --> 00:26:48,395
No, I can't. I'm studying.

329
00:26:48,499 --> 00:26:50,433
To be what?

330
00:26:50,535 --> 00:26:52,969
A petroleum tycoon. Okay?

331
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:54,970
Like your father?

332
00:26:55,072 --> 00:26:57,040
No. Like myself.

333
00:27:00,211 --> 00:27:03,647
Boy, that little visit of his
really threw you, didn't it?

334
00:27:03,748 --> 00:27:06,717
No, Ted, it didn't throw me.

335
00:27:06,818 --> 00:27:09,286
I know where I'm going.

336
00:27:14,492 --> 00:27:17,290
You find the emotional strength
to handle this?

337
00:27:18,529 --> 00:27:21,896
You're in limbo, buddy.

338
00:27:21,999 --> 00:27:24,661
Emotional limbo.

339
00:27:24,769 --> 00:27:27,567
You're not in heaven,
and you're not in hell.

340
00:27:31,108 --> 00:27:33,076
I'm sorry.

341
00:27:34,111 --> 00:27:36,602
I remember what it's like too.

342
00:27:39,684 --> 00:27:43,415
Go on. Get out of here.
Go home. Study.

343
00:27:43,521 --> 00:27:45,489
I'll take in a film...

344
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:47,956
<i>or something.</i>

345
00:28:02,974 --> 00:28:06,466
<i>I should be home in about an hour.
I'll see you then.</i>

346
00:28:09,647 --> 00:28:11,615
I'm Ted Dinard.

347
00:28:14,051 --> 00:28:16,679
I know.
How?

348
00:28:16,787 --> 00:28:20,348
I saw your picture.
Did Steven show it to you?

349
00:28:20,458 --> 00:28:22,949
He asked me to get something
for him one night.

350
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:26,393
I opened his drawer,
and there was your photograph.

351
00:28:26,497 --> 00:28:30,024
<i>I said, ""This must be Ted. '"
He said, ""Yes. '"</i>

352
00:28:34,171 --> 00:28:36,605
Would you like some coffee?

353
00:28:36,707 --> 00:28:40,165
Yeah.
It's in the back. Come.

354
00:28:49,754 --> 00:28:51,722
Our only chair.

355
00:28:53,758 --> 00:28:55,658
Sit.

356
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:59,560
Do you take cream and sugar?
No. Black, please.

357
00:29:02,867 --> 00:29:05,062
Here.
Oh, thank you.

358
00:29:13,678 --> 00:29:15,646
I always knew we'd meet.

359
00:29:15,746 --> 00:29:18,647
I just tried to imagine where.

360
00:29:20,318 --> 00:29:23,219
And did you eventually?
Hmm.

361
00:29:23,321 --> 00:29:27,018
It was a wood, a forest.

362
00:29:27,124 --> 00:29:29,183
There was fog.

363
00:29:29,293 --> 00:29:31,659
I was there alone.

364
00:29:31,762 --> 00:29:35,425
You came out of the fog toward me.

365
00:29:35,533 --> 00:29:38,001
I suppose that symbolizes something.

366
00:29:38,102 --> 00:29:41,037
Confusion maybe.

367
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:45,275
Veiled fearsyours.

368
00:29:47,778 --> 00:29:49,678
Maybe.

369
00:29:51,682 --> 00:29:54,708
You're afraid right now.
Aren't you?

370
00:29:54,819 --> 00:29:59,119
You know that Steven's relationship with you
is only to prove something to himself.

371
00:29:59,223 --> 00:30:02,852
You have absolutely no idea
what goes on between Steven and me.

372
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,952
I know something about love...

373
00:30:06,063 --> 00:30:08,122
and loving...

374
00:30:08,232 --> 00:30:10,257
and being loved.

375
00:30:18,876 --> 00:30:22,107
Are you going to give him up?

376
00:30:22,213 --> 00:30:24,113
Are you?

377
00:30:24,248 --> 00:30:28,685
Look, doesn't it bother you that what
we're doing is tearing Steven apart?

378
00:30:29,787 --> 00:30:32,312
That we're all being torn apart?

379
00:30:32,423 --> 00:30:36,416
Steven and me...

380
00:30:36,527 --> 00:30:39,496
and you.

381
00:30:39,597 --> 00:30:43,624
Well, I've I've known better nights than this.
That's for sure.

382
00:30:43,734 --> 00:30:47,101
Yeah, with your husband.
What's that supposed to mean?

383
00:30:47,204 --> 00:30:49,832
Obviously, you can't make
your own marriage work.

384
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:53,842
If you think you're gonna take Steven
and turn him around

385
00:30:53,944 --> 00:30:57,675
What is that?
A badge of honor, a validation?

386
00:30:57,782 --> 00:30:59,750
Proof that you're a real woman?

387
00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:02,341
That's an ugly thing to say.
That really is.

388
00:31:02,453 --> 00:31:06,412
<i>I love Steven, Mrs. Blaisdel...</i>

389
00:31:06,524 --> 00:31:10,620
and I'll fight for him if I have to.

390
00:31:19,203 --> 00:31:21,171
I'm sorry.

391
00:31:22,807 --> 00:31:25,776
I don't usually behave this way.

392
00:31:33,551 --> 00:31:36,019
When I came here tonight,
I was hoping...

393
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:38,714
<i>that you would be...</i>

394
00:31:38,823 --> 00:31:40,791
somebody wretched...

395
00:31:40,891 --> 00:31:43,860
and somebody I could hate.

396
00:31:49,467 --> 00:31:51,435
But I can't.

397
00:31:53,304 --> 00:31:55,272
Goodbye, Claudia.

398
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:31,701
Hi.
Is he drinking again?

399
00:32:31,809 --> 00:32:35,677
Yes.
Oh, it's too much. It's not like him.

400
00:32:38,215 --> 00:32:40,410
Is there any of that veal left?

401
00:32:40,518 --> 00:32:43,146
Oh, my husband stopped by
and took it home.

402
00:32:43,254 --> 00:32:47,554
But this is very good. Why don't you have some?
It's there on the stove.

403
00:32:49,894 --> 00:32:52,021
Oh, they didn't eat anything tonight.

404
00:32:52,129 --> 00:32:55,326
Oh, well.
Feed a cold, starve a fever.

405
00:32:55,432 --> 00:32:58,401
There's been a fever
in this house lately.

406
00:32:59,436 --> 00:33:02,132
Mrs. Carrington is so lovely.

407
00:33:02,239 --> 00:33:04,969
I hate to see her trying
to cope with his ways.

408
00:33:05,075 --> 00:33:08,272
Well, it seems to me
she might try a little harder...

409
00:33:08,379 --> 00:33:10,506
in exchange for all he gives her.

410
00:33:10,614 --> 00:33:12,707
Ladies.

411
00:33:12,817 --> 00:33:14,717
Ladies.

412
00:33:17,755 --> 00:33:21,088
It's been said that gossip
is part of the human condition...

413
00:33:21,192 --> 00:33:23,660
<i>a healthy interest
in the people around us...</i>

414
00:33:23,761 --> 00:33:26,423
except that I don't appreciate it
when the interest...

415
00:33:26,530 --> 00:33:29,397
is in the man
who employs us and feeds us.

416
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:31,400
We're only just saying,Joseph

417
00:33:31,502 --> 00:33:35,939
<i>I heard what you were saying
about Mr. Carrington...</i>

418
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:41,000
<i>but what I didn't hear you say
was that he's a good man...</i>

419
00:33:41,111 --> 00:33:43,671
who's in very serious trouble
right now.

420
00:33:43,781 --> 00:33:47,683
<i>You see, he's hurting. Hurt.</i>

421
00:33:47,785 --> 00:33:51,744
Now, we've been together
a long time, he and I...

422
00:33:51,856 --> 00:33:54,586
and despite the difference in our stations,
we're good friends...

423
00:33:54,692 --> 00:33:58,150
<i>and it offends me to see him hurt.</i>

424
00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:14,978
Forgive me, madam.

425
00:34:15,079 --> 00:34:17,877
Mr. Carrington isn't feeling so well.

426
00:34:17,982 --> 00:34:20,849
I think I may have to
put him into bed.

427
00:34:20,951 --> 00:34:23,215
If you don't mind.

428
00:34:50,948 --> 00:34:53,576
I've got to talk to you, Blake.

429
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:05,360
Can you hear me?

430
00:35:30,487 --> 00:35:33,854
[ Sighs ]
Maybe it's just as well you can't.

431
00:35:39,229 --> 00:35:41,197
<i>I've loved you, Blake.</i>

432
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,268
I've loved you the best I could.

433
00:35:50,941 --> 00:35:53,535
And I believe that

434
00:35:53,644 --> 00:35:56,374
that you've loved me...

435
00:35:57,548 --> 00:35:59,448
<i>in your own way.</i>

436
00:36:02,486 --> 00:36:05,114
But you frighten me.

437
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:09,286
You're so many different people.

438
00:36:12,029 --> 00:36:16,489
Gentle... and sensitive one minute...

439
00:36:20,104 --> 00:36:22,629
treacherous and brutal the next.

440
00:36:30,581 --> 00:36:34,745
<i>Maybe you have to be that way
to survive in your world...</i>

441
00:36:39,757 --> 00:36:43,955
but I I can't live
with the suspicion.

442
00:36:45,462 --> 00:36:48,090
I can't live with the rage.

443
00:36:55,472 --> 00:36:57,440
I love you...

444
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:03,409
but I can't live with you.

445
00:37:41,185 --> 00:37:44,985
Joseph, what's Mrs. Carrington's car
doing here?

446
00:37:45,089 --> 00:37:47,580
Uh, I asked Michael to bring it around...

447
00:37:47,691 --> 00:37:50,159
but she insisted I order her
a taxicab instead.

448
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:53,855
Where is she?
She's gone.

449
00:37:53,964 --> 00:37:57,400
Gone? You mean that she's
she's, uh she's gone out?

450
00:37:57,501 --> 00:38:00,664
She's gone. She left early this morning
carrying a small suitcase.

451
00:38:00,771 --> 00:38:04,002
She said she'd send you a letter
explaining it all.

452
00:38:10,547 --> 00:38:13,983
How could you let her go?
It wasn't my place to stop her.

453
00:38:14,084 --> 00:38:17,212
Why couldn't you
wake me up and tell me?

454
00:38:20,224 --> 00:38:22,317
She ordered me not to.

455
00:38:22,426 --> 00:38:26,886
She is the mistress of this house,
as you so often reminded us.

456
00:38:26,997 --> 00:38:29,966
You're not a bit unhappy about
seeing her go, are you,Joseph?

457
00:38:30,067 --> 00:38:34,527
Well, she'll be back.
You can be sure about that. She'll be back.

458
00:38:42,179 --> 00:38:45,706
I love her,Joseph.

459
00:38:45,816 --> 00:38:48,341
I don't think I can bear to lose her.

460
00:38:48,452 --> 00:38:50,443
Yes, I understand.

461
00:38:58,862 --> 00:39:02,127
Perhaps I've been too hard on her.

462
00:39:02,232 --> 00:39:04,700
That whole business
about the necklace.

463
00:39:04,801 --> 00:39:08,259
I don't think I was very fair
about that.

464
00:39:09,907 --> 00:39:13,172
I should have asked her to explain.

465
00:39:21,652 --> 00:39:23,620
She'll be back.

466
00:39:26,957 --> 00:39:29,653
You'll see. My wife will be back.

467
00:39:52,516 --> 00:39:54,984
[ Krystle ]
I'll be right back.

468
00:40:09,132 --> 00:40:11,259
Yeah?

469
00:40:11,368 --> 00:40:15,134
Matthew, it's Krystle.
Krystle?

470
00:40:15,239 --> 00:40:18,936
I'm, um, calling to say goodbye.

471
00:40:19,042 --> 00:40:21,237
What?
I'm leaving.

472
00:40:21,345 --> 00:40:23,540
Where are you going?

473
00:40:23,647 --> 00:40:27,378
Oh, I don't know.
Maybe back into Ohio. I don't know.

474
00:40:29,219 --> 00:40:32,882
Krystle. I've got to see you.

475
00:40:35,525 --> 00:40:38,323
No, that that would be
the worst thing.

476
00:40:38,428 --> 00:40:42,091
Then let's do the worst thing.

477
00:40:46,870 --> 00:40:48,997

478
00:41:08,225 --> 00:41:09,658
[ Sighs ]

479
00:41:28,412 --> 00:41:30,744
Krystle, I

480
00:41:30,847 --> 00:41:33,816
I don't want you to leave.
Not Not like this.

481
00:42:08,385 --> 00:42:10,853
You have a wife, Matthew...

482
00:42:10,954 --> 00:42:12,922
and a daughter.

483
00:42:15,525 --> 00:42:19,086
For once in my life,
I don't want to think about that.

484
00:42:22,766 --> 00:42:26,532
I know you.
[ Chuckles ]

485
00:42:26,636 --> 00:42:30,538
If you don't now, you will later.

486
00:42:35,112 --> 00:42:37,080
Goodbye, Matthew.

487
00:43:13,350 --> 00:43:16,046
<i>[ Knocking ]
Come in.</i>

488
00:43:20,690 --> 00:43:23,352
What kind of thing is this?
Leaving me a note.

489
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:26,020
I didn't invite you
into this house, Ted.

490
00:43:26,129 --> 00:43:28,427
Oh, excuse me.
The Carrington house.

491
00:43:28,532 --> 00:43:31,626
My father's house.

492
00:43:31,735 --> 00:43:35,398
Look, I just want to pack a few things
and go to my apartment.

493
00:43:35,505 --> 00:43:38,497
Alone?
Yes, alone.

494
00:43:38,608 --> 00:43:41,771
Look, I mean, do you think you
can just send me away with this?

495
00:43:41,878 --> 00:43:44,506
Ted, I have to send you away.

496
00:43:44,614 --> 00:43:46,514
And what are you gonna do?

497
00:43:46,616 --> 00:43:50,347
Just stick around this town, messing around
with a married woman from time to time?

498
00:43:50,454 --> 00:43:52,251
I won't be seeing her anymore.

499
00:43:52,355 --> 00:43:54,789
Then what is the plan, Steven?

500
00:43:54,891 --> 00:43:57,121
Live alone, miserable...

501
00:43:57,227 --> 00:43:59,855
<i>occasional guy on the side?</i>

502
00:44:04,968 --> 00:44:09,064
Steven. Steven, please.

503
00:44:09,172 --> 00:44:13,199
Look, there's a there's a plane
that leaves for New York in an hour.

504
00:44:13,310 --> 00:44:15,778
We could be on that plane.

505
00:44:17,881 --> 00:44:22,409
Steven, please.
We had something very special.

506
00:44:22,519 --> 00:44:24,987
We had each other.

507
00:44:26,456 --> 00:44:28,583
Steven, you and me

508
00:44:28,692 --> 00:44:30,956
Ted, no.

509
00:44:31,061 --> 00:44:33,859
Ted, it'sit's not you.

510
00:44:33,964 --> 00:44:37,559
It's not Claudia. It's me.

511
00:44:37,667 --> 00:44:40,101
It's me.

512
00:44:40,203 --> 00:44:43,263
For God's sakes,
I want you to understand.

513
00:44:43,373 --> 00:44:46,308
And if you ever really loved me
the way I loved you...

514
00:44:49,913 --> 00:44:51,847
you'll understand.

515
00:44:53,583 --> 00:44:55,483
[ Sighs ]

516
00:44:57,454 --> 00:44:59,422
Oh, Mr. Carrington.

517
00:45:01,024 --> 00:45:03,322
Jeanette, I wish
Good evening, Mr. Carrington.

518
00:45:03,426 --> 00:45:06,190
Joseph, is Mrs. Carrington back yet?

519
00:45:06,296 --> 00:45:09,925
No, sir.
Fallon and Jeff are they here?

520
00:45:10,033 --> 00:45:12,024
I think Fallon is.

521
00:45:12,135 --> 00:45:14,160
Steven is upstairs with a friend...

522
00:45:14,271 --> 00:45:16,239
a Mr. Dinard.

523
00:45:18,208 --> 00:45:20,108
In my house?

524
00:45:22,479 --> 00:45:24,504
I'll kill him.

525
00:45:28,385 --> 00:45:32,014
Next time I go to Central Park,
I'll send you a pretzel.

526
00:45:32,122 --> 00:45:35,285
But easy on the salt.
Right.

527
00:45:42,732 --> 00:45:44,893
This isn't easy for me.

528
00:45:45,001 --> 00:45:47,196
It's not for me either.

529
00:45:47,304 --> 00:45:49,772
Yeah.

530
00:45:49,873 --> 00:45:53,866
Well, at least
we've got good memories.

531
00:46:01,651 --> 00:46:04,916
Take care, buddy.
You too, buddy.

532
00:46:08,959 --> 00:46:11,587
Get your hands off my son!
Dad, we were...

533
00:46:11,695 --> 00:46:14,762
I said, get your hands off him!

534
00:46:21,972 --> 00:46:25,032
Damn!

535
00:46:25,141 --> 00:46:26,938
No! No!

536
00:46:38,989 --> 00:46:41,757
He's not breathing.

537
00:46:44,828 --> 00:46:47,428
You've killed him.

538
00:46:57,007 --> 00:46:59,532
Oh, Ted. Ted?
