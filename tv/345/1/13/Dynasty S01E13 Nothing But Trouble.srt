1
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:04,102
- <i>Previously on</i> Dynasty...
<i>- The Carringtons</i>

2
00:00:04,108 --> 00:00:06,140
are the reason Dad's in prison, Monica.

3
00:00:06,142 --> 00:00:08,176
Blake framed him with
those drug charges.

4
00:00:08,178 --> 00:00:09,580
Ted Dinard's here to see you.

5
00:00:09,615 --> 00:00:10,812
<i>Last time I saw him</i>

6
00:00:10,814 --> 00:00:13,181
I assumed would be the
last time I saw him.

7
00:00:13,183 --> 00:00:15,650
I'm writing a major
exposé on Senator Daniels.

8
00:00:15,652 --> 00:00:18,419
One of the people that
Daniels took bribes from...

9
00:00:18,421 --> 00:00:19,687
was Blake.

10
00:00:19,689 --> 00:00:21,189
I protected you from the scandal.

11
00:00:21,191 --> 00:00:23,124
But I also had to protect my integrity.

12
00:00:23,126 --> 00:00:26,294
And that meant ending Daniels'
campaign one way or another.

13
00:00:26,296 --> 00:00:27,895
After listening to Daniels spin

14
00:00:27,897 --> 00:00:30,632
his web of discrimination and arrogance,
I got to thinking.

15
00:00:30,634 --> 00:00:31,833
It's time to bet on myself.

16
00:00:31,835 --> 00:00:33,334
I'm running for office.

17
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:36,437
<i>Culhane was watching your every move.</i>

18
00:00:36,439 --> 00:00:38,106
<i>So I had to sell a different story.</i>

19
00:00:38,108 --> 00:00:40,041
- Damn, Monica.
- They are the reason

20
00:00:40,043 --> 00:00:41,442
that we were raised without a father.

21
00:00:41,444 --> 00:00:43,511
And now you want to make them
pay for what they've done?

22
00:00:43,513 --> 00:00:44,979
Well, so do I.

23
00:00:49,753 --> 00:00:52,186
You know, I'm glad we're friends again,
but I do not miss you

24
00:00:52,188 --> 00:00:54,389
dragging me to Pilates at 7:00 a.m.

25
00:00:54,391 --> 00:00:55,790
I think I pulled something.

26
00:00:55,792 --> 00:00:57,325
That just means it's working.

27
00:00:57,327 --> 00:00:59,193
Well, can we bond over
something normal next time?

28
00:00:59,195 --> 00:01:01,062
Like booze and bad decisions.

29
00:01:01,064 --> 00:01:03,064
Well, what kind of bad
decisions are you talking?

30
00:01:03,066 --> 00:01:06,968
Not like vomiting whiskey sours
in the halls of Ivy House bad.

31
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:09,437
Ugh. I remember that night.
Unfortunately.

32
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:10,791
Was that the same time

33
00:01:10,792 --> 00:01:12,092
- you pretended to be French?
- Uh, no!

34
00:01:12,108 --> 00:01:15,977
You pretended to be poor,
so you could bum clove cigarettes.

35
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:18,513
Oh, I'm gonna miss that place.

36
00:01:18,515 --> 00:01:19,747
It was an era.

37
00:01:19,749 --> 00:01:21,049
What do you mean, "miss"?

38
00:01:21,051 --> 00:01:22,216
Oh, you didn't hear?

39
00:01:22,218 --> 00:01:24,519
Ivy House is closing next week,
like, forever.

40
00:01:24,521 --> 00:01:26,187
Oh, my God! Well, we have to go.

41
00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:28,356
Come on.
One last girls' night before it's gone.

42
00:01:28,358 --> 00:01:29,524
What are you doing tonight?

43
00:01:29,526 --> 00:01:30,525
Picking you up at 9:00

44
00:01:30,527 --> 00:01:32,393
and staying away from whiskey sours.

45
00:01:36,539 --> 00:01:37,098
<i>Please tell me</i>

46
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:40,177
- one of those is for me.
- It was,

47
00:01:40,212 --> 00:01:43,062
- but I don't know how hot it is anymore.
- Well, I just spent

48
00:01:43,097 --> 00:01:44,939
an hour and a half on a
medieval torture device

49
00:01:44,941 --> 00:01:47,308
called a reformer,
thanks to your sister.

50
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:48,609
You don't have aspirin, do you?

51
00:01:49,446 --> 00:01:51,946
Maybe this will make you feel better.

52
00:01:54,451 --> 00:01:56,050
My counteroffer.

53
00:01:56,052 --> 00:01:59,253
Wait, you're actually
gonna let me buy you out?

54
00:02:00,274 --> 00:02:03,691
It may have been my money,
but this company has your soul.

55
00:02:04,153 --> 00:02:07,488
Took me some time to realize it,
but Morell should be yours.

56
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:09,256
Our lawyers can figure out the rest.

57
00:02:10,426 --> 00:02:12,092
Well, what made you change your mind?

58
00:02:12,094 --> 00:02:15,396
Monica may have nudged me
in the right direction.

59
00:02:15,398 --> 00:02:18,599
Well, whatever she said,

60
00:02:18,601 --> 00:02:20,434
thank you, Jeff.

61
00:02:21,704 --> 00:02:24,705
You have no idea how
much this means to me.

62
00:02:27,009 --> 00:02:28,022
I do.

63
00:02:28,544 --> 00:02:30,110
If you're lucky,
I'll throw in some aspirin.

64
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:38,886
What do you think?

65
00:02:38,888 --> 00:02:40,688
You're asking the wrong person.

66
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:43,490
- You're 45 minutes late.
- I thought 9:00

67
00:02:43,492 --> 00:02:45,063
was more of a suggestion.

68
00:02:45,728 --> 00:02:48,862
Okay. Can you get that?
Just take a message.

69
00:02:48,864 --> 00:02:50,464
Steven's about to tell Daddy

70
00:02:50,466 --> 00:02:52,199
that he's running for office,
and he needs me there

71
00:02:52,201 --> 00:02:53,267
for emotional support.

72
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:54,868
Good morning.

73
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:57,037
Morell Green Energy Corp., a subsidiary

74
00:02:57,039 --> 00:02:59,039
of Colby Co.,
Fallon Carrington's office.

75
00:02:59,041 --> 00:03:01,342
Samuel Josiah Jones speaking.
How can I help you?

76
00:03:01,344 --> 00:03:03,310
Should I call myself Mr. Jones?

77
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:06,680
No, not you. Who's this?

78
00:03:06,682 --> 00:03:08,716
Are you happy with your
phone and Internet service?

79
00:03:08,718 --> 00:03:09,984
Okay, all right.

80
00:03:09,986 --> 00:03:11,151
You know what,

81
00:03:11,153 --> 00:03:12,653
we'll work on that later.

82
00:03:12,655 --> 00:03:15,289
For now, let's play to your strengths.

83
00:03:16,125 --> 00:03:17,424
Lunch?

84
00:03:17,426 --> 00:03:19,026
No. Girls' night.

85
00:03:19,028 --> 00:03:21,195
Monica and I are going
out for one last hurrah

86
00:03:21,197 --> 00:03:22,563
before Ivy House closes.

87
00:03:22,565 --> 00:03:24,798
And now, we can celebrate my
impending sole proprietorship.

88
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,634
So I need you to get us a table.

89
00:03:26,636 --> 00:03:28,836
I won't let you down.

90
00:03:34,844 --> 00:03:36,877
Did you bring your laundry, too?

91
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:37,945
Just the whites.

92
00:03:37,947 --> 00:03:39,847
I'll leave a doggy bag by the dryer.

93
00:03:41,117 --> 00:03:42,149
Did I miss it?

94
00:03:42,151 --> 00:03:43,217
Miss what?

95
00:03:43,219 --> 00:03:44,318
Thanks for coming.

96
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,353
I wanted to talk to you
guys about something.

97
00:03:46,355 --> 00:03:47,888
Fallon already knows.

98
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:49,790
Well, you're not gay, are you?

99
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:51,725
Worse.

100
00:03:51,727 --> 00:03:53,794
I've decided to run for city council.

101
00:03:54,274 --> 00:03:55,893
Oh, why would you want to do that?

102
00:03:55,998 --> 00:03:58,232
Pamela Hu isn't running
again in District 13.

103
00:03:58,234 --> 00:04:00,134
And I want to do something constructive,

104
00:04:00,136 --> 00:04:01,535
positive, helpful.

105
00:04:01,537 --> 00:04:03,037
You sound like a Democrat.

106
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:04,805
At least he's not a criminal.

107
00:04:04,807 --> 00:04:08,208
Personally, I think we could use
more good people in politics.

108
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:10,277
And we could certainly
use more Democrats.

109
00:04:10,279 --> 00:04:12,746
If you want to give back,
volunteer at a soup kitchen.

110
00:04:12,748 --> 00:04:15,115
Politics is a full-contact sport.

111
00:04:15,117 --> 00:04:15,916
I know that.

112
00:04:15,918 --> 00:04:18,152
Your entire past becomes fair game.

113
00:04:18,154 --> 00:04:19,687
You don't exactly have
a great track record.

114
00:04:19,689 --> 00:04:22,790
A month ago, you were snorting
half of Manhattan up your nose.

115
00:04:22,792 --> 00:04:23,891
- Blake.
- Daddy.

116
00:04:23,893 --> 00:04:25,259
Don't be so old-fashioned.

117
00:04:25,261 --> 00:04:27,361
A couple more felonies,
and he could be president.

118
00:04:28,698 --> 00:04:30,798
I have to get to the office.

119
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,233
The puppies won't kill themselves,
you know.

120
00:04:36,105 --> 00:04:38,605
Well, that went well.

121
00:04:39,973 --> 00:04:40,674
<i>Girls' night,</i>

122
00:04:40,676 --> 00:04:42,343
huh?

123
00:04:42,345 --> 00:04:45,679
You asked me to help you
get Fallon back, didn't you?

124
00:04:45,681 --> 00:04:48,449
She already thinks I'm on her
side with this Morell Corp. thing.

125
00:04:48,451 --> 00:04:51,085
A few drinks,
some hoes-before-bros crap,

126
00:04:51,087 --> 00:04:53,220
and she'll be hanging
on to my every word.

127
00:04:53,222 --> 00:04:55,923
Including every word about
what an amazing guy you are.

128
00:04:55,925 --> 00:04:59,360
Mm. Kind of guy who'd walk away
from a billion dollar potential

129
00:04:59,362 --> 00:05:00,694
just to make her happy.

130
00:05:00,696 --> 00:05:02,096
Exactly.

131
00:05:02,098 --> 00:05:04,365
She needs to feel like
she doesn't have to choose

132
00:05:04,367 --> 00:05:06,166
between you and her independence.

133
00:05:06,168 --> 00:05:08,602
She needs to feel like you know her.

134
00:05:09,438 --> 00:05:10,971
And if it doesn't work,

135
00:05:10,973 --> 00:05:13,307
at least you got your
money back from Morell.

136
00:05:13,309 --> 00:05:15,008
That's not the point.

137
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:17,778
Blake Carrington took
everything from Dad.

138
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:19,646
Now we're taking everything from him.

139
00:05:19,648 --> 00:05:21,515
First his daughter, then his empire.

140
00:05:21,517 --> 00:05:23,050
Eyes on the prize.

141
00:05:24,186 --> 00:05:26,487
You ready?

142
00:05:26,489 --> 00:05:28,155
<i>For what it's worth,</i>

143
00:05:28,157 --> 00:05:29,356
I think you're doing the right thing.

144
00:05:29,358 --> 00:05:31,091
Don't let your dad discourage you.

145
00:05:31,093 --> 00:05:31,992
Don't worry.

146
00:05:31,994 --> 00:05:33,594
I'm too fired up about this.

147
00:05:33,596 --> 00:05:36,530
For the first time in a long time,
I actually feel proactive.

148
00:05:36,532 --> 00:05:38,732
Besides, I don't want his money anyway.

149
00:05:38,734 --> 00:05:41,402
If I'd listened to him,
I'd have an MBA and a better golf swing.

150
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:43,871
Well, he is right about one thing.

151
00:05:43,873 --> 00:05:47,107
- Tax cuts?
- Putting yourself out there in the public eye.

152
00:05:47,109 --> 00:05:49,843
People are gonna be
looking for any mistake.

153
00:05:49,845 --> 00:05:51,745
And I've made a lot, I know.

154
00:05:51,747 --> 00:05:55,282
But I can't change what
happened with Dominic Ortega.

155
00:05:55,284 --> 00:05:57,151
Or Stansfield.

156
00:05:57,153 --> 00:05:58,619
- Or Ted...
- Stansfield?

157
00:05:58,621 --> 00:06:00,854
I mean,
we all know he didn't retire that early

158
00:06:00,856 --> 00:06:02,055
on a government pension.

159
00:06:02,057 --> 00:06:03,357
On the bright side,

160
00:06:03,359 --> 00:06:04,625
I don't think we'll be seeing his face

161
00:06:04,627 --> 00:06:05,659
around here anytime soon.

162
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:07,795
Much to my father's dismay.

163
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:10,531
Well, take it from me,

164
00:06:10,533 --> 00:06:13,534
you can't count on your
skeletons staying in the closet.

165
00:06:13,536 --> 00:06:16,637
The best thing you can do
right now is own it all.

166
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:18,238
Beat everyone else to the punch.

167
00:06:18,888 --> 00:06:19,873
You might be right.

168
00:06:20,481 --> 00:06:22,368
Don't tell your dad.

169
00:06:46,535 --> 00:06:48,602
Hey, Dad.

170
00:06:49,251 --> 00:06:50,934
_

171
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:53,941
I can't believe it.

172
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:55,442
It's been...

173
00:06:55,444 --> 00:06:58,078
Eight and a half years.

174
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,280
I am so sorry.

175
00:07:01,116 --> 00:07:03,417
No, you didn't do anything.

176
00:07:03,419 --> 00:07:05,385
I didn't believe you.

177
00:07:05,387 --> 00:07:07,521
I spent all this time thinking

178
00:07:07,523 --> 00:07:09,490
that you had turned your back on us.

179
00:07:09,492 --> 00:07:11,425
I thought you were selfish.

180
00:07:11,427 --> 00:07:14,895
I had no idea what they did to you.

181
00:07:15,465 --> 00:07:17,664
And I didn't give you
the benefit of the doubt.

182
00:07:19,568 --> 00:07:22,035
But I know now.

183
00:07:22,597 --> 00:07:23,871
And I'm here now.

184
00:07:24,406 --> 00:07:25,606
Thank you.

185
00:07:27,084 --> 00:07:29,543
And after your parole hearing tomorrow,

186
00:07:29,545 --> 00:07:31,044
you'll be out of here.

187
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:33,413
Yeah, I thought that before.

188
00:07:34,224 --> 00:07:36,950
Three times I've been up in
front of the parole board.

189
00:07:36,951 --> 00:07:38,051
_

190
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,286
Mm-mm.

191
00:07:39,324 --> 00:07:44,594
_

192
00:07:44,872 --> 00:07:49,405
_

193
00:07:50,099 --> 00:07:52,132
His influence is eroding.

194
00:07:52,588 --> 00:07:55,669
And without that,
you've been a model inmate.

195
00:07:55,671 --> 00:07:58,705
Not a single disciplinary
action on your record.

196
00:07:59,258 --> 00:08:02,409
Carringtons always find a way.

197
00:08:02,411 --> 00:08:04,011
When you walk out those gates,

198
00:08:04,013 --> 00:08:06,313
Blake will see he's not invincible.

199
00:08:07,424 --> 00:08:09,316
He'll feel the walls closing in on him,

200
00:08:09,318 --> 00:08:11,852
like you've felt the last 11 years.

201
00:08:13,155 --> 00:08:14,655
But we're not gonna stop there.

202
00:08:15,991 --> 00:08:17,724
I'm gonna finish what I started.

203
00:08:17,726 --> 00:08:19,226
We are.

204
00:08:21,581 --> 00:08:24,298
And nothing is gonna stop us.

205
00:08:47,042 --> 00:08:48,609
I had to move your
car to let Steven out.

206
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:49,843
I'm leaving anyway.

207
00:08:49,845 --> 00:08:51,345
I have to go meet with my lawyers.

208
00:08:51,347 --> 00:08:52,479
Is everything okay?

209
00:08:52,481 --> 00:08:54,181
Oh, it's more than okay.

210
00:08:54,183 --> 00:08:57,518
Jeff finally agreed to let me
buy him out of Morell Corp.

211
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,519
Wow.

212
00:08:58,521 --> 00:09:00,554
Con... gratulations.

213
00:09:00,909 --> 00:09:03,557
You could muster
a little more enthusiasm.

214
00:09:03,559 --> 00:09:06,093
I'm happy for you. I'm just surprised.

215
00:09:06,095 --> 00:09:08,629
Last I heard,
he wasn't too interested in selling.

216
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:09,963
He came around.

217
00:09:09,965 --> 00:09:11,598
Come on.
You're Blake Carrington's daughter.

218
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,134
You know that nobody just
comes around for no reason.

219
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:16,770
Well, I can think of 100 million
reasons off the top of my head.

220
00:09:16,772 --> 00:09:19,406
I mean, it's not like he's
giving me the company for free.

221
00:09:19,408 --> 00:09:21,642
Plus, I think Monica
talked some sense into him.

222
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:23,443
When she slapped him in
the face the other night

223
00:09:23,445 --> 00:09:24,778
at the casino party?

224
00:09:25,581 --> 00:09:27,314
Well, I don't care how she did it.

225
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:29,016
All I care is that it's happening.

226
00:09:30,553 --> 00:09:32,586
My God, if there's anyone
I'm worried about, it's Sam.

227
00:09:32,588 --> 00:09:34,354
Burning the place down.

228
00:09:41,931 --> 00:09:44,832
I was going over the numbers
in our European portfolio,

229
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:46,099
and I think we should
have a conversation

230
00:09:46,101 --> 00:09:48,468
about our UK operations,
depending on Brexit.

231
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:50,304
Well, that sounds good.
Why don't you leave your notes,

232
00:09:50,306 --> 00:09:52,773
and we will discuss
after I've read through.

233
00:09:52,775 --> 00:09:54,474
I have to call D.C. in five minutes.

234
00:09:54,476 --> 00:09:57,511
After the Daniels debacle,
there's still some damage control

235
00:09:57,513 --> 00:09:59,880
to be done.

236
00:09:59,882 --> 00:10:02,683
Is that why you're so against
Steven running for city council?

237
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:04,718
Is that why you're so gung ho for it?

238
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,053
Trying to punish me for Daniels?

239
00:10:06,736 --> 00:10:08,155
You didn't tell me
about Stansfield either.

240
00:10:08,157 --> 00:10:10,457
- Who said anything about Stansfield?
- Who cares?

241
00:10:10,459 --> 00:10:14,294
Steven has no idea
what he's walking into.

242
00:10:14,296 --> 00:10:15,896
His name alone will put
a target on his back.

243
00:10:15,898 --> 00:10:17,064
- On his or on yours?
- He doesn't know

244
00:10:17,066 --> 00:10:18,365
how much I've protected him.

245
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:19,867
The hits that I have taken for him,

246
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:21,101
hits that he couldn't take.

247
00:10:21,103 --> 00:10:23,337
Maybe because you haven't
given him a chance.

248
00:10:23,743 --> 00:10:25,606
Steven is passionate about this, Blake.

249
00:10:25,608 --> 00:10:28,242
And he's going into it
with his eyes wide open,

250
00:10:28,244 --> 00:10:30,711
owning his mistakes,
instead of hiding them.

251
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:32,079
And what happens when it backfires?

252
00:10:32,081 --> 00:10:34,448
Who's gonna clean up the mess? Again?

253
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:36,470
This is not just his problem.

254
00:10:36,505 --> 00:10:37,918
It's gonna expose the entire family.

255
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,920
Just don't encourage him!

256
00:10:39,922 --> 00:10:41,788
Please. That's all I ask.

257
00:10:53,168 --> 00:10:54,868
- Hello?
- Sam.

258
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:56,503
It's Culhane.

259
00:10:56,505 --> 00:10:58,438
Steven told me that
you're working for Fallon.

260
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,606
First day.

261
00:10:59,608 --> 00:11:01,008
Hey. Congratulations, man.

262
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:02,676
Are you at the office right now?

263
00:11:02,678 --> 00:11:03,877
Yeah.

264
00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:05,279
Uh, is Jeff around?

265
00:11:05,281 --> 00:11:06,580
No.

266
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:09,283
Good. I need to ask you a favor.

267
00:11:09,285 --> 00:11:11,652
Says the man who never
lets me drive the Bentley.

268
00:11:12,888 --> 00:11:14,254
Well, I could always tell Fallon

269
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:15,989
what happened to her
favorite Gucci sweater.

270
00:11:16,582 --> 00:11:17,491
What favor?

271
00:11:17,493 --> 00:11:19,259
I need you to take a look
around Jeff's computer.

272
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:21,895
See if you find any information
related to the Morell buyout.

273
00:11:21,897 --> 00:11:23,802
E-mails, calls, paperwork.

274
00:11:23,837 --> 00:11:25,232
What? Why?

275
00:11:25,902 --> 00:11:27,567
'Cause something's not adding up,
and I have a feeling

276
00:11:27,569 --> 00:11:29,670
that Jeff Colby can't
be taken at his word.

277
00:11:29,672 --> 00:11:31,638
Well, it sounds like this
is between you and Jeff

278
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,839
and definitely not me.

279
00:11:32,841 --> 00:11:34,908
This is about Fallon.
If Jeff's up to something,

280
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:36,710
she's the one who's going to get hurt.

281
00:11:36,712 --> 00:11:38,745
And since she's the one
cutting your checks...

282
00:11:38,747 --> 00:11:40,380
Why don't you just ask her?

283
00:11:40,382 --> 00:11:43,150
I tried, but she's so excited
about getting her company back,

284
00:11:43,152 --> 00:11:45,652
I'm afraid she's not gonna
do her usual due diligence.

285
00:11:45,654 --> 00:11:47,821
Thanks.

286
00:11:58,468 --> 00:11:59,599
Mr. Oakley.

287
00:11:59,601 --> 00:12:01,635
I trust I didn't keep
you waiting too long.

288
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:02,776
Not too long.

289
00:12:03,305 --> 00:12:06,273
Well, I know you need to get to work,
so I won't waste your time.

290
00:12:06,275 --> 00:12:08,108
We need this to happen today.

291
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:10,110
And of course,
we need this whole arrangement

292
00:12:10,112 --> 00:12:12,679
to remain thoroughly discreet.

293
00:12:12,681 --> 00:12:14,181
This is for your trouble.

294
00:12:15,537 --> 00:12:18,585
Just let us know if there
are any other expenses.

295
00:12:19,632 --> 00:12:22,022
I take it that your daughter
is liking her new school?

296
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:24,224
Yes, sir.

297
00:12:25,072 --> 00:12:26,293
We'll be in touch.

298
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,901
I was glad that you called.

299
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,737
There were so many times that I thought

300
00:12:36,739 --> 00:12:38,839
about reaching out over the past month

301
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:41,141
to thank you for bailing me out.

302
00:12:41,143 --> 00:12:43,210
But I wanted to stay focused,

303
00:12:43,212 --> 00:12:44,945
and put in the work to get clean.

304
00:12:45,854 --> 00:12:47,381
I'm really proud of you, Ted.

305
00:12:47,383 --> 00:12:50,050
Honestly, I've been trying
to do the same thing myself.

306
00:12:50,052 --> 00:12:51,385
Really look in the mirror,

307
00:12:51,387 --> 00:12:53,887
and try to figure out
how I can do better.

308
00:12:53,889 --> 00:12:56,223
I think I've found it.

309
00:12:56,225 --> 00:12:58,037
I've decided to run for city council.

310
00:12:59,995 --> 00:13:02,262
Oh, I'm sorry. No, no.

311
00:13:02,264 --> 00:13:03,597
I didn't mean it like that.

312
00:13:03,599 --> 00:13:05,499
I ju... well, I mean, what about...?

313
00:13:05,501 --> 00:13:06,800
The partying?

314
00:13:06,802 --> 00:13:08,964
That's actually why I called you.

315
00:13:08,999 --> 00:13:11,772
With my name, my entire biography
is gonna be scrutinized,

316
00:13:11,774 --> 00:13:13,540
and if my father has taught me anything,

317
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:15,409
it's that I can't hide from my past,

318
00:13:15,411 --> 00:13:16,810
even if I tried to.

319
00:13:17,536 --> 00:13:19,112
So I'm not gonna try.

320
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,049
I want to be honest about
the mistakes that I've made,

321
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:26,186
and... that includes the
mistakes we made together.

322
00:13:26,188 --> 00:13:27,487
Like New York?

323
00:13:27,489 --> 00:13:29,506
Yeah. I mean, don't get me wrong.

324
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:31,224
I'm not trying to drag
your name into any of this.

325
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:33,927
But if someone starts sniffing around,

326
00:13:34,589 --> 00:13:36,189
you're in those pictures, too.

327
00:13:36,191 --> 00:13:38,191
I just wouldn't want
you to be blindsided.

328
00:13:38,193 --> 00:13:40,126
Thanks.

329
00:13:40,128 --> 00:13:41,729
Is that why you called me over here?

330
00:13:41,764 --> 00:13:44,163
Well, more than that.

331
00:13:44,165 --> 00:13:46,232
I wouldn't want to do this
without your blessing.

332
00:13:46,234 --> 00:13:49,569
Means a lot to know that
you're thinking of me.

333
00:13:55,143 --> 00:13:58,034
- What the hell are you doing?
- Hey! I was, um...

334
00:13:58,539 --> 00:14:00,446
looking for the coffee
maker instructions.

335
00:14:00,515 --> 00:14:02,915
That thing is like a spaceship.

336
00:14:02,917 --> 00:14:05,618
Did you check the drawer
under the coffee maker?

337
00:14:06,988 --> 00:14:08,488
That would make sense.

338
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:10,523
Sam!

339
00:14:10,525 --> 00:14:13,092
- Culhane made me do it.
- Do what?

340
00:14:13,094 --> 00:14:15,862
He told me to look through Jeff's
e-mails and files and stuff.

341
00:14:15,864 --> 00:14:17,890
What the hell would Culhane
want with Jeff's e-mails?

342
00:14:17,933 --> 00:14:21,367
I think he thinks Jeff is trying
to screw you over on the buyout.

343
00:14:23,505 --> 00:14:24,971
You have got to be kidding me.

344
00:14:25,053 --> 00:14:26,986
Please don't fire me.

345
00:14:26,988 --> 00:14:30,156
This job's really important
for my self-esteem.

346
00:14:31,526 --> 00:14:34,060
So, do you want me to keep
going with the girls' night?

347
00:14:34,905 --> 00:14:37,097
Okay, I'll keep going.

348
00:14:42,441 --> 00:14:43,640
Head count. Let's go.

349
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,777
Head count now? What happened?

350
00:14:49,014 --> 00:14:51,348
You heard me. Let's go.

351
00:14:58,490 --> 00:14:59,455
What the hell?!

352
00:14:59,859 --> 00:15:01,358
I need backup! I need help!

353
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,782
He's got a weapon!

354
00:15:03,429 --> 00:15:04,614
I need help!

355
00:15:05,231 --> 00:15:06,530
I didn't do anything!

356
00:15:10,652 --> 00:15:12,035
- Get off me, man!
- Get him out of here!

357
00:15:12,037 --> 00:15:13,337
I didn't do anything!

358
00:15:18,189 --> 00:15:19,909
_

359
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:21,543
I don't know where that knife came from,

360
00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:22,777
but it wasn't mine!

361
00:15:22,779 --> 00:15:24,179
He stabbed himself in his own leg!

362
00:15:24,181 --> 00:15:25,880
I know. I believe you.

363
00:15:25,882 --> 00:15:27,582
But the parole board won't.

364
00:15:27,584 --> 00:15:29,984
No, they're not just gonna
deny parole for this.

365
00:15:29,986 --> 00:15:31,152
They're gonna add time.

366
00:15:31,154 --> 00:15:33,021
- I'm gonna fix it.
- How?

367
00:15:33,023 --> 00:15:34,361
My hearing's tomorrow.

368
00:15:35,022 --> 00:15:38,893
I told you,
Carringtons always find a way.

369
00:15:38,895 --> 00:15:41,262
So do I.

370
00:15:41,933 --> 00:15:43,131
Just sit tight.

371
00:15:43,133 --> 00:15:44,833
Okay?

372
00:15:46,203 --> 00:15:48,737
I wanted to tell you
that I took your advice

373
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:50,805
about getting ahead of my skeletons.

374
00:15:50,807 --> 00:15:52,307
I just met with Ted.

375
00:15:52,309 --> 00:15:54,376
You didn't waste any time.

376
00:15:54,378 --> 00:15:55,510
I didn't want to lose my nerve.

377
00:15:55,512 --> 00:15:57,112
But Ted seemed to understand

378
00:15:57,114 --> 00:15:59,013
that this is something I needed to do.

379
00:15:59,015 --> 00:16:00,982
It was pretty liberating, actually.

380
00:16:00,984 --> 00:16:02,751
Of course,
the real test will be when I announce.

381
00:16:03,978 --> 00:16:06,821
You know, I have an old
friend at the<i> Atlanta Mirror.</i>

382
00:16:06,823 --> 00:16:07,889
He covers politics.

383
00:16:07,891 --> 00:16:09,324
It might be a good idea

384
00:16:09,326 --> 00:16:12,193
for you to sit down with him and
lay everything out on the table

385
00:16:12,195 --> 00:16:14,229
right from the get-go.

386
00:16:14,231 --> 00:16:16,464
I can reach out... if you're ready.

387
00:16:16,466 --> 00:16:17,632
Thank you.

388
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,401
You know,

389
00:16:19,403 --> 00:16:21,202
you would make a pretty
good campaign manager

390
00:16:21,204 --> 00:16:22,837
if you're interested in a pay cut.

391
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:26,241
I'm just happy I can help.

392
00:16:30,418 --> 00:16:32,180
What the hell happened? Is Dad okay?

393
00:16:32,182 --> 00:16:33,948
He's fine. I mean, he's not hurt.

394
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:35,350
The whole thing was staged.

395
00:16:35,352 --> 00:16:36,885
Okay, look,
I've been doing some research,

396
00:16:36,887 --> 00:16:38,153
and I think we need help

397
00:16:38,155 --> 00:16:39,687
from someone higher up the food chain.

398
00:16:39,689 --> 00:16:40,855
What about Bobbi?

399
00:16:40,857 --> 00:16:42,524
Yeah, I called her on the way home,

400
00:16:42,526 --> 00:16:44,559
asked her to vouch for
Dad to the parole board.

401
00:16:44,561 --> 00:16:46,594
- And?
- And maybe Blake had the right idea,

402
00:16:46,596 --> 00:16:48,163
keeping Stansfield in his pocket.

403
00:16:48,165 --> 00:16:50,732
She said she got the job
'cause she's on the up-and-up.

404
00:16:50,734 --> 00:16:53,968
She's not gonna compromise that now,
not even for Dad.

405
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:55,203
All right, I'm calling Fallon.

406
00:16:55,205 --> 00:16:56,871
There's no way I'm going out tonight.

407
00:16:57,478 --> 00:16:59,107
You have to.

408
00:16:59,109 --> 00:17:01,042
I'm not gonna drink
cosmos and talk about boys

409
00:17:01,044 --> 00:17:03,044
while Dad's whole future
hangs in the balance, Jeff.

410
00:17:03,046 --> 00:17:05,613
This is a setback... a temporary one,

411
00:17:05,615 --> 00:17:07,549
if I have anything to say about it...

412
00:17:07,551 --> 00:17:09,984
and I'm not gonna let it bring
down everything we're working for.

413
00:17:09,986 --> 00:17:11,966
- Fallon can wait.
- If you cancel now,

414
00:17:12,001 --> 00:17:13,721
it'll only make her
think something's up.

415
00:17:14,624 --> 00:17:16,658
You said you were on the team,
didn't you?

416
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,827
Well, this is
what the team needs right now,

417
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:22,163
so suck it up, smile and drink some Dom.

418
00:17:22,165 --> 00:17:24,199
I'll handle Dad.

419
00:17:26,703 --> 00:17:28,203
What is wrong with you?!

420
00:17:29,673 --> 00:17:31,506
I have a feeling you're
about to tell me.

421
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:33,541
I just caught Snoopy Jo pawing
through my desk drawers,

422
00:17:33,543 --> 00:17:34,742
apparently on your behalf,

423
00:17:34,744 --> 00:17:36,110
and thank God I did.

424
00:17:36,112 --> 00:17:37,979
Can you imagine if Jeff
had found him first,

425
00:17:37,981 --> 00:17:39,781
- or if he thought that I had put him up to it?
- Fallon...

426
00:17:39,783 --> 00:17:41,316
We're in the middle of
buyout negotiations.

427
00:17:41,318 --> 00:17:43,318
If I lose Jeff's trust,
I could lose my company.

428
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,987
- Fallon, listen...
- You know, I never took you for the jealous type,

429
00:17:45,989 --> 00:17:48,490
but Jeff sure does bring out
your Norman Bates, doesn't he?

430
00:17:48,492 --> 00:17:52,560
- Why can't you just let it go?
- Damn it, Fallon. You think this is about Jeff?!

431
00:17:52,562 --> 00:17:54,195
I was trying to protect<i> you!</i>

432
00:17:54,197 --> 00:17:55,964
How many men do I need to say this to?

433
00:17:55,966 --> 00:17:57,098
I don't need your protection!

434
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,967
You're right.
You're no damsel in distress,

435
00:17:58,969 --> 00:18:00,401
but you're still human!

436
00:18:01,238 --> 00:18:03,671
And I love you way too much to just
stand by and watch you get hurt.

437
00:18:04,882 --> 00:18:05,640
You what?

438
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:07,876
I love you.

439
00:18:10,776 --> 00:18:12,943
Michael, how could you say that?

440
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,980
You're with Monica.

441
00:18:16,599 --> 00:18:17,982
And she's gonna be here soon.

442
00:18:18,366 --> 00:18:19,817
I have to go.

443
00:18:23,886 --> 00:18:24,822
<i>You're early.</i>

444
00:18:24,824 --> 00:18:26,858
Well, it's not every day
that Cristal Flores...

445
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:27,959
oh, I'm so sorry...

446
00:18:27,961 --> 00:18:29,594
Cristal<i> Carrington</i>

447
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:31,496
summons you to her corner office.

448
00:18:31,498 --> 00:18:33,064
It's not a corner.

449
00:18:33,066 --> 00:18:36,034
And it's not every day I have
a scoop worth discussing.

450
00:18:36,036 --> 00:18:38,703
But I owe you,
so I'm gonna bring it to you first.

451
00:18:38,705 --> 00:18:40,371
"Heir...

452
00:18:40,373 --> 00:18:43,074
"to Carrington Atlantic fortune
rejects the family business

453
00:18:43,076 --> 00:18:44,475
for public service."

454
00:18:44,477 --> 00:18:46,077
Well, I know
you're not talking about Fallon.

455
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:49,013
Steven is running for city
council on a grassroots,

456
00:18:49,015 --> 00:18:50,281
for-the-people platform.

457
00:18:50,283 --> 00:18:52,250
Steven Carrington has
hugged his share of trees,

458
00:18:52,252 --> 00:18:54,819
but last I checked,
he was still living in Daddy's house.

459
00:18:54,821 --> 00:18:56,054
Check again.

460
00:18:56,056 --> 00:18:57,955
Steven wants to make a
difference here in Atlanta,

461
00:18:57,957 --> 00:18:59,624
and it has nothing to do with Blake.

462
00:18:59,626 --> 00:19:02,960
Look, I appreciate the exclusive,

463
00:19:02,962 --> 00:19:06,030
but you know I built my career
sniffing out corruption, right?

464
00:19:06,032 --> 00:19:09,167
Not lobbing softball
questions at trust fund kids.

465
00:19:09,169 --> 00:19:11,769
From what you told me last week,
you've made your career

466
00:19:11,771 --> 00:19:13,838
on page views and unique visitor counts.

467
00:19:14,494 --> 00:19:17,408
Plus, Steven can handle a few hardballs.

468
00:19:18,027 --> 00:19:19,510
What, are you his campaign manager now?

469
00:19:20,264 --> 00:19:22,513
Just an enthusiastic volunteer.

470
00:19:24,551 --> 00:19:26,951
Well, you took a chance on
me when nobody else would.

471
00:19:26,953 --> 00:19:30,154
So if you say there's
something to this kid,

472
00:19:30,156 --> 00:19:31,255
I'll take a chance, too.

473
00:19:32,192 --> 00:19:34,158
You've always had good instincts.

474
00:19:35,462 --> 00:19:38,059
You know,
if you wanted to pitch me a story,

475
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:38,930
all you had to do was call.

476
00:19:40,278 --> 00:19:41,999
Yeah, but I knew
I'd have to convince you,

477
00:19:42,001 --> 00:19:45,403
and I thought that would
be easier in person.

478
00:19:46,395 --> 00:19:47,438
Good instinct.

479
00:19:48,993 --> 00:19:50,608
Let me know about that interview.

480
00:20:05,224 --> 00:20:06,917
This really necessary?

481
00:20:06,993 --> 00:20:10,127
Dark alley, I mean?

482
00:20:10,129 --> 00:20:12,093
If you're trying to creep me out,
it's working.

483
00:20:12,632 --> 00:20:15,483
This can't be your first dark
alley in your line of work.

484
00:20:15,502 --> 00:20:17,528
Honestly,
investigative journalism has led

485
00:20:17,537 --> 00:20:19,136
to a lot fewer shadowy meetings

486
00:20:19,138 --> 00:20:21,060
than<i> All the President's Men</i>
would have me to believe.

487
00:20:21,074 --> 00:20:22,099
More texting, though.

488
00:20:22,108 --> 00:20:25,042
There are some things I'd
rather not put in writing.

489
00:20:25,044 --> 00:20:29,280
Apparently, you felt the same way
about Blake Carrington bribing judges.

490
00:20:29,683 --> 00:20:32,049
What happened to the story I gave you?

491
00:20:32,051 --> 00:20:33,384
The story evolved.

492
00:20:33,386 --> 00:20:35,043
Either way, it brought Daniels down.

493
00:20:35,055 --> 00:20:36,666
But it didn't touch Blake,

494
00:20:36,756 --> 00:20:39,390
and now he's coming
after my father again.

495
00:20:39,452 --> 00:20:40,484
What are you talking about?

496
00:20:40,486 --> 00:20:42,686
A guard at North State Correctional

497
00:20:42,688 --> 00:20:44,955
shanked himself today,
and said my dad did it,

498
00:20:44,957 --> 00:20:47,124
the day before his parole hearing.

499
00:20:47,126 --> 00:20:51,128
My father's been there 11 years,
never had a problem with anyone.

500
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:52,630
And you think Blake paid this guy?

501
00:20:52,632 --> 00:20:55,399
Blake Carrington sent my father
to prison in the first place,

502
00:20:55,401 --> 00:20:57,935
and he's been pulling strings
to keep him in there ever since.

503
00:20:57,937 --> 00:20:59,470
I know he's behind this.

504
00:20:59,472 --> 00:21:01,939
Look,
I'm no friend of Blake Carrington's,

505
00:21:01,941 --> 00:21:03,641
but you don't have any proof.

506
00:21:03,643 --> 00:21:05,776
Isn't that your job?

507
00:21:05,778 --> 00:21:08,212
The guard's name is Randall Oakley.

508
00:21:10,249 --> 00:21:11,682
I'll see what I can find.

509
00:21:11,684 --> 00:21:13,184
But even if you're right,

510
00:21:13,186 --> 00:21:15,052
even if I could prove it,

511
00:21:15,054 --> 00:21:17,088
it's not gonna be before tomorrow.

512
00:21:42,555 --> 00:21:44,822
Ladies. If you'll follow me.

513
00:21:57,737 --> 00:21:59,337
Your private room.

514
00:22:00,306 --> 00:22:01,873
Your personal dancers.

515
00:22:01,875 --> 00:22:03,474
Is that sushi?

516
00:22:03,476 --> 00:22:05,276
And your own full bar.

517
00:22:05,278 --> 00:22:06,577
Anything else you need,

518
00:22:06,579 --> 00:22:08,513
any one of them will be
more than happy to help you.

519
00:22:08,515 --> 00:22:12,250
Okay, I've been here before,
but this is next level.

520
00:22:12,252 --> 00:22:13,584
Sam did good.

521
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,720
So what are we drinking?

522
00:22:29,863 --> 00:22:32,046
_

523
00:22:45,218 --> 00:22:47,351
Okay, this might be the sake talking,

524
00:22:47,353 --> 00:22:49,954
but do you think this is
what heaven looks like?

525
00:22:49,956 --> 00:22:51,722
Oh,
I'll never know what heaven looks like,

526
00:22:51,724 --> 00:22:53,624
but this is the best girls'
night I can remember.

527
00:22:55,094 --> 00:22:56,160
To girls' night.

528
00:22:56,716 --> 00:22:57,958
To the girl boss.

529
00:22:57,993 --> 00:23:00,197
Oh. I'll drink to that.

530
00:23:01,769 --> 00:23:04,340
I mean, Jeff's great, obviously.

531
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,971
But I've always wanted
to own my own company.

532
00:23:06,973 --> 00:23:10,488
I mean, while other kids were
drawing rainbows and unicorns,

533
00:23:10,523 --> 00:23:11,876
I was workshopping my letterhead.

534
00:23:11,878 --> 00:23:13,244
I know.

535
00:23:13,246 --> 00:23:14,712
I'm proud of you, Fallon.

536
00:23:15,581 --> 00:23:17,016
And a little jealous.

537
00:23:17,051 --> 00:23:18,482
I mean, not of your warped childhood,

538
00:23:18,484 --> 00:23:20,758
- obviously.
- Obviously.

539
00:23:20,793 --> 00:23:22,820
And don't get me wrong,
I love my brother.

540
00:23:22,822 --> 00:23:24,422
I'm super grateful for
everything he's done

541
00:23:24,424 --> 00:23:25,990
for our whole family,

542
00:23:25,992 --> 00:23:28,326
but sometimes I feel like
I owe him everything.

543
00:23:28,328 --> 00:23:30,661
Like I don't have
anything that's just mine.

544
00:23:32,398 --> 00:23:33,998
You could have this place.

545
00:23:34,867 --> 00:23:37,201
- Seriously.
- Okay, you're drunk.

546
00:23:37,203 --> 00:23:38,701
I bought it for you.

547
00:23:38,736 --> 00:23:39,503
No strings.

548
00:23:39,505 --> 00:23:41,005
It's not mine, it's not Jeff's.

549
00:23:41,007 --> 00:23:42,707
- Fallon, you can't.
- Why not?

550
00:23:42,709 --> 00:23:46,277
You've been saying you want to own
your own club since high school.

551
00:23:46,279 --> 00:23:47,878
I know you always think
I'm not listening,

552
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,280
but I'm listening.

553
00:23:51,884 --> 00:23:53,951
Do you want to go downstairs
and hang with the real people?

554
00:23:53,953 --> 00:23:55,286
For old times' sake?

555
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:57,321
<i>Bien sur.</i>

556
00:23:58,324 --> 00:24:00,458
<i>Je m'appelle</i> Monique.

557
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:07,999
Good timing. Check.

558
00:24:08,001 --> 00:24:12,507
Mr. Oakley is in stable condition
in Northeast Georgia Medical Center.

559
00:24:12,542 --> 00:24:13,838
Expected to make a full recovery.

560
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:16,173
That's good news.

561
00:24:16,175 --> 00:24:17,608
You need some.

562
00:24:21,103 --> 00:24:22,246
Can I talk to you?

563
00:24:28,462 --> 00:24:29,553
Who is Randall Oakley?

564
00:24:30,523 --> 00:24:31,822
What are you talking about?

565
00:24:31,824 --> 00:24:33,991
A prison guard at North
State Correctional Facility,

566
00:24:33,993 --> 00:24:38,295
who was apparently stabbed
by Cecil Colby today.

567
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:40,939
Where is this coming from?

568
00:24:41,553 --> 00:24:43,834
So you do know what I'm talking about.

569
00:24:44,938 --> 00:24:48,312
Paul Daniels was the judge
in Cecil Colby's case.

570
00:24:48,347 --> 00:24:49,273
Stansfield made a point

571
00:24:49,275 --> 00:24:51,475
to recommend against parole
every time Colby came up.

572
00:24:51,477 --> 00:24:53,444
Cecil Colby should be in prison.

573
00:24:53,446 --> 00:24:55,613
That's what courts are for, Blake.

574
00:24:55,615 --> 00:24:58,808
- You can't just be judge and jury.
- You sound like Steven.

575
00:24:58,843 --> 00:25:00,584
Good. That's why I'm supporting him.

576
00:25:01,883 --> 00:25:03,836
Cecil tried to kill me, Cristal.

577
00:25:03,871 --> 00:25:05,823
- What? When?
- 11 years ago.

578
00:25:05,825 --> 00:25:07,391
He accused me of having
an affair with his wife.

579
00:25:08,545 --> 00:25:09,894
- Did you?
- Of course not.

580
00:25:10,763 --> 00:25:12,129
The man was crazy.

581
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:13,698
He still is.

582
00:25:13,733 --> 00:25:14,832
Who knows what he'd do if he got out.

583
00:25:19,238 --> 00:25:21,311
<i>There's nothing
I can do for you, Mr. Colby.</i>

584
00:25:21,593 --> 00:25:24,428
So you're just gonna sit back,
knowing my father was framed?

585
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:25,759
I don't know that.

586
00:25:25,761 --> 00:25:27,461
You don't know that.

587
00:25:27,463 --> 00:25:31,064
I understand it's hard for a child
to see their parent go through this.

588
00:25:31,066 --> 00:25:33,767
You were hoping that he
was gonna be released,

589
00:25:33,769 --> 00:25:34,935
that he'd change.

590
00:25:34,937 --> 00:25:36,069
He has changed.

591
00:25:36,071 --> 00:25:39,439
Like I said, nothing I can do.

592
00:25:40,743 --> 00:25:41,908
I've got to get back to work.

593
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:44,845
What does our fine government
pay you, anyway?

594
00:25:44,847 --> 00:25:48,248
Hmm? I'm sure I could triple it.

595
00:25:49,485 --> 00:25:50,984
You'd never have to work again.

596
00:25:50,986 --> 00:25:52,452
Are you trying to bribe me?

597
00:25:52,454 --> 00:25:53,654
That's a felony.

598
00:25:53,656 --> 00:25:55,889
I'm trying to save my father.

599
00:25:57,317 --> 00:25:59,693
Everyone has a price.

600
00:26:04,099 --> 00:26:05,499
Are you coming or what?

601
00:26:05,501 --> 00:26:07,067
Popcorn's getting cold.

602
00:26:09,071 --> 00:26:11,271
Did you order food?

603
00:26:15,678 --> 00:26:17,511
- Ted.
- Sam. Wait,

604
00:26:17,513 --> 00:26:18,712
what-what are you doing here?

605
00:26:18,714 --> 00:26:19,813
I live here.

606
00:26:19,815 --> 00:26:21,715
Aren't you supposed to be in rehab?

607
00:26:22,129 --> 00:26:22,997
Ted.

608
00:26:23,476 --> 00:26:25,885
- Uh, is everything okay?
- Oh.

609
00:26:26,722 --> 00:26:28,088
Yeah, I, uh...

610
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:29,523
You know,
I-I just couldn't find my wallet,

611
00:26:29,525 --> 00:26:31,525
and I thought maybe
I left it here earlier.

612
00:26:31,527 --> 00:26:33,260
Well, that's a classic.

613
00:26:33,262 --> 00:26:35,195
Sam,
is something burning in the kitchen?

614
00:26:35,197 --> 00:26:36,363
I think it's popcorn.

615
00:26:36,365 --> 00:26:38,332
I told you I hate that
microwave popcorn.

616
00:26:39,301 --> 00:26:40,834
Okay, I'll check.

617
00:26:42,204 --> 00:26:44,871
I don't think I've seen your wallet,
but I can...

618
00:26:44,873 --> 00:26:47,708
Ah, don't worry about it.
I'm sure that it's gonna pop up.

619
00:26:48,444 --> 00:26:49,743
I am so sorry to bother you.

620
00:26:49,745 --> 00:26:51,812
I didn't realize that you two were...

621
00:26:51,814 --> 00:26:53,280
Oh, no, no.

622
00:26:53,282 --> 00:26:54,514
We're just roommates.

623
00:26:54,516 --> 00:26:55,615
Cable ain't cheap.

624
00:26:55,617 --> 00:26:56,717
You know?

625
00:26:56,719 --> 00:26:58,985
I'm a drug addict, Steven, not an idiot.

626
00:26:58,987 --> 00:27:01,254
Look, when you asked me
to come over today,

627
00:27:01,256 --> 00:27:02,923
and, uh, you know,

628
00:27:02,925 --> 00:27:04,624
you were talking about
turning over a new leaf.

629
00:27:04,626 --> 00:27:08,528
And you were asking me to-to
help out on your campaign.

630
00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:10,297
I mean, something was there.

631
00:27:10,299 --> 00:27:13,300
Ted, I think we've had
a misunderstanding.

632
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:16,470
All those things I said today are true.

633
00:27:16,472 --> 00:27:17,671
I care about you.

634
00:27:17,673 --> 00:27:18,416
I really do.

635
00:27:18,442 --> 00:27:21,908
But I think right now,
we both need to focus

636
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:24,244
on turning over our own leaves.

637
00:27:24,246 --> 00:27:25,612
You know?

638
00:27:25,614 --> 00:27:27,514
Yeah. No, of course.

639
00:27:27,516 --> 00:27:29,049
Hey, my mistake.

640
00:27:30,285 --> 00:27:31,952
Enjoy your movie.

641
00:27:38,026 --> 00:27:39,826
You see? Isn't this so much better

642
00:27:39,828 --> 00:27:41,161
than being mortal enemies?

643
00:27:41,163 --> 00:27:42,696
Hmm, I don't know.

644
00:27:42,698 --> 00:27:44,564
I kind of miss you drowning
me in the sprinklers.

645
00:27:44,566 --> 00:27:46,304
- I'm sorry about that.
- You know you don't play

646
00:27:46,335 --> 00:27:47,704
with a girl's hair.

647
00:27:48,003 --> 00:27:49,703
To be honest,

648
00:27:49,705 --> 00:27:51,738
I had kind of written
you off until last night.

649
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:53,373
Well, nothing like
a little sexual harassment

650
00:27:53,375 --> 00:27:54,608
to bring women together.

651
00:27:55,485 --> 00:27:56,977
Actually, it was Jeff.

652
00:27:57,946 --> 00:27:59,446
He asked me to make up with you.

653
00:27:59,448 --> 00:28:00,414
What?

654
00:28:01,394 --> 00:28:03,550
Well, he knew how upset you were
about what happened between us,

655
00:28:03,552 --> 00:28:05,285
and he just wants you to be happy.

656
00:28:06,922 --> 00:28:09,823
Why do you think he's letting
you buy him out of the company?

657
00:28:12,594 --> 00:28:16,263
He bought you a ring, Fallon.

658
00:28:16,265 --> 00:28:18,298
He's in love with you.

659
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:20,867
He always has been.

660
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:28,719
I got your text.

661
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:31,808
Is everything okay? Where's Monica?

662
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:34,077
Why are you letting me buy
you out of Morell Corp.?

663
00:28:35,175 --> 00:28:36,913
I thought that's what you wanted.

664
00:28:36,915 --> 00:28:38,381
Well, it is.

665
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:39,916
But it's not what you want.

666
00:28:39,918 --> 00:28:41,651
You've been tying it up for weeks

667
00:28:41,653 --> 00:28:43,186
with your lawyers, dragging your feet.

668
00:28:43,188 --> 00:28:45,555
So why did you say yes?

669
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:47,390
What changed?

670
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:49,292
Oh, God. Uh...

671
00:28:49,294 --> 00:28:51,060
What did Monica say to you?

672
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:54,898
Well... she said
you were in love with me,

673
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:57,267
which is insane, obviously.

674
00:28:58,751 --> 00:28:59,769
Is it?

675
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:05,442
Every time I get involved with you,
I end up in nothing but trouble.

676
00:29:06,139 --> 00:29:08,446
Well, you also end up with money.

677
00:29:08,814 --> 00:29:11,548
Lots and lots of money.

678
00:29:12,551 --> 00:29:15,285
I remember the first
time I ever saw you.

679
00:29:15,733 --> 00:29:19,022
At one of my Penley
basketball games with Monica.

680
00:29:19,024 --> 00:29:23,091
All white sunglasses,
high-waisted jeans, red lipstick.

681
00:29:23,128 --> 00:29:24,794
My Chloe Sevigny period.

682
00:29:25,022 --> 00:29:28,331
I knew I had to get your attention.

683
00:29:28,333 --> 00:29:31,634
I have been trying to get
your attention ever since.

684
00:29:31,636 --> 00:29:33,169
And when you said you wanted

685
00:29:33,171 --> 00:29:36,406
to buy me out,
I was afraid I was gonna lose you.

686
00:29:38,043 --> 00:29:40,443
Well, you have my attention now.

687
00:29:41,343 --> 00:29:43,680
But I finally realized...

688
00:29:43,682 --> 00:29:45,715
you can't make someone love you back.

689
00:29:47,062 --> 00:29:49,953
You can't will it into existence.

690
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:53,523
If it's meant to be, it'll be.

691
00:29:58,964 --> 00:30:01,297
Did Monica tell you about this?

692
00:30:03,034 --> 00:30:04,219
She did, actually.

693
00:30:04,236 --> 00:30:07,370
There should be a law against
my sister drinking and talking.

694
00:30:07,372 --> 00:30:09,038
Though in my defense,

695
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,907
I tried to tell you first.

696
00:30:11,782 --> 00:30:13,877
I tried to give this to you

697
00:30:13,879 --> 00:30:16,412
right before you broke up with me.

698
00:30:17,637 --> 00:30:20,550
But as long as we're
laying it all out there,

699
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:22,185
here it is.

700
00:30:27,592 --> 00:30:29,592
And it's still yours...

701
00:30:29,594 --> 00:30:31,127
if you want it.

702
00:30:31,129 --> 00:30:32,462
J-Jeff, I c...

703
00:30:32,464 --> 00:30:35,198
No, you-you don't have
to decide right now.

704
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,933
In fact, I don't want you to.

705
00:30:38,136 --> 00:30:39,669
I heard you when you said you needed

706
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:41,671
to figure things out for yourself.

707
00:30:44,442 --> 00:30:46,142
And I'll wait for you.

708
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:49,812
As long as you need.

709
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:08,220
Sorry about that.

710
00:31:08,222 --> 00:31:10,422
Got a little tied up.

711
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:13,834
But I'm all yours now.

712
00:31:26,063 --> 00:31:28,464
You know what, Susan?
Let's lose the flowers.

713
00:31:28,466 --> 00:31:30,566
We're trying to project more
"grassroots,"

714
00:31:30,568 --> 00:31:32,988
less "in-house florist."

715
00:31:33,071 --> 00:31:34,674
Lady of the Manor, huh?

716
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:37,940
I remember when we thought
IMAX was a splurge.

717
00:31:40,278 --> 00:31:42,178
Steven. Right on time.

718
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:45,414
- I wanted you to meet Rick Morales.
- Good to meet you, Steven.

719
00:31:45,416 --> 00:31:47,507
Cristal speaks the world of you,
which means a lot to me.

720
00:31:47,585 --> 00:31:49,434
- Well, thank you for doing this.
- Of course.

721
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:52,855
So, I'd love to just jump right in,
so it doesn't feel too rehearsed.

722
00:31:52,857 --> 00:31:55,191
And, uh, looks like they're ready to go.

723
00:31:55,783 --> 00:31:57,359
<i>So, we'll be live-streaming this</i>

724
00:31:57,361 --> 00:31:59,529
on the<i> Mirror's</i> website
and social media.

725
00:31:59,591 --> 00:32:02,725
Which means no way to edit my questions

726
00:32:02,727 --> 00:32:03,826
or your answers.

727
00:32:03,828 --> 00:32:05,228
Guess I'd better not screw up, then.

728
00:32:07,365 --> 00:32:09,032
It's feeding.

729
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:11,834
Rick Morales here with
Atlanta's newest candidate

730
00:32:11,836 --> 00:32:14,070
for city council, Steven Carrington.

731
00:32:14,602 --> 00:32:16,604
Steven, thank you for joining us.

732
00:32:16,639 --> 00:32:18,541
- Thanks for having me.
- Steven, I think

733
00:32:18,543 --> 00:32:20,843
many Atlanta voters may
have a preconceived idea

734
00:32:20,845 --> 00:32:23,379
of what a Carrington
candidacy looks like.

735
00:32:23,381 --> 00:32:24,781
What are you hoping
to achieve by running

736
00:32:24,783 --> 00:32:26,683
- for local government?
- I can imagine

737
00:32:26,685 --> 00:32:29,352
what people might think
when they hear my last name.

738
00:32:29,354 --> 00:32:30,887
Oil. Money.

739
00:32:30,889 --> 00:32:32,088
Oil money.

740
00:32:32,090 --> 00:32:33,589
And don't get me wrong,

741
00:32:33,591 --> 00:32:36,826
I love my family, but I've also
never hesitated to call out

742
00:32:36,828 --> 00:32:39,062
Carrington Atlantic when I
disagree with their policies.

743
00:32:39,064 --> 00:32:41,831
And I'm serious about
making sure that everyone

744
00:32:41,833 --> 00:32:43,599
gets to enjoy our beautiful city.

745
00:32:43,601 --> 00:32:45,935
You also have a history
of substance abuse,

746
00:32:45,937 --> 00:32:47,704
including a stint in rehab in 2013.

747
00:32:47,706 --> 00:32:49,772
What would you say to
Atlantans concerned

748
00:32:49,774 --> 00:32:51,074
you're not up to the job?

749
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:54,477
I think Oscar Wilde said
it better than I could.

750
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:58,114
"Experience is simply the
name we give our mistakes."

751
00:32:58,116 --> 00:33:00,616
I made mine, early and often,

752
00:33:00,618 --> 00:33:03,753
and I can't change my past,
but I can learn from it.

753
00:33:03,755 --> 00:33:05,788
And I have.

754
00:33:15,967 --> 00:33:17,834
The parole board hearing
of Cecil Baldwin Colby

755
00:33:17,836 --> 00:33:18,968
is back in order.

756
00:33:18,970 --> 00:33:23,706
This is the fourth hearing
for prisoner number 2F529.

757
00:33:23,708 --> 00:33:25,775
Mr. Colby, you organized a crime

758
00:33:25,777 --> 00:33:28,277
in which you were in
possession of narcotics

759
00:33:28,279 --> 00:33:30,279
with the intent to distribute.

760
00:33:30,281 --> 00:33:33,049
You have been incarcerated
for almost 11 years.

761
00:33:33,051 --> 00:33:34,450
And, for almost 11 years,

762
00:33:34,452 --> 00:33:36,853
you have maintained exemplary behavior.

763
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:41,958
However,
in light of the ongoing investigation

764
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:45,461
to the serious injury
of a guard yesterday,

765
00:33:45,463 --> 00:33:47,263
this board cannot in good conscience

766
00:33:47,265 --> 00:33:49,465
recommend your release
to the commissioner.

767
00:33:50,587 --> 00:33:51,334
Therefore,

768
00:33:51,945 --> 00:33:54,818
at this time,
the board votes unanimously

769
00:33:54,853 --> 00:33:56,372
against parole.

770
00:34:21,332 --> 00:34:23,332
Thank you.

771
00:34:26,942 --> 00:34:29,054
_

772
00:34:30,708 --> 00:34:32,809
Means a lot to me.
Thank you for doing this.

773
00:34:32,811 --> 00:34:34,477
Of course.

774
00:34:37,015 --> 00:34:38,881
Oh, I thought
you'd gone into the office.

775
00:34:38,883 --> 00:34:40,183
No, I was working here.

776
00:34:40,185 --> 00:34:43,119
I heard some of Steven's, uh, interview.

777
00:34:43,121 --> 00:34:44,554
And?

778
00:34:44,556 --> 00:34:46,656
He may not share my politics,
but he handled himself

779
00:34:46,658 --> 00:34:48,591
like a Carrington today.

780
00:34:48,593 --> 00:34:50,626
You should tell him that.

781
00:34:50,628 --> 00:34:52,295
I will.

782
00:34:52,982 --> 00:34:54,297
I owe you an apology.

783
00:34:55,261 --> 00:34:56,332
For the way I reacted.

784
00:34:56,334 --> 00:34:58,501
I was just... surprised, I guess.

785
00:34:58,503 --> 00:35:00,903
We all know you hate surprises.

786
00:35:01,581 --> 00:35:03,039
There have been a lot of them lately.

787
00:35:03,835 --> 00:35:05,441
I've always had my world under control.

788
00:35:05,443 --> 00:35:07,877
It can be scary to lose control.

789
00:35:08,514 --> 00:35:09,979
It can also be liberating.

790
00:35:09,981 --> 00:35:12,648
Well... I can't afford to find out.

791
00:35:12,970 --> 00:35:15,037
Of course you can...
You of all people can.

792
00:35:15,039 --> 00:35:16,739
I thought the same thing, too, once,

793
00:35:16,741 --> 00:35:18,507
and I had to learn the hard way.

794
00:35:18,509 --> 00:35:20,176
It's not the same thing, Cristal.

795
00:35:20,178 --> 00:35:22,211
And I'm glad that Steven

796
00:35:22,213 --> 00:35:24,680
has you in his corner,
politics or otherwise.

797
00:35:25,512 --> 00:35:27,650
And I'm glad that I have you in mine.

798
00:35:41,933 --> 00:35:43,465
Who died?

799
00:35:43,467 --> 00:35:44,867
As expected,

800
00:35:44,869 --> 00:35:46,969
in light of the incident
with Mr. Oakley,

801
00:35:46,971 --> 00:35:49,138
the board voted to deny parole.

802
00:35:50,238 --> 00:35:52,107
I don't understand...
That sounds like<i> good</i> news.

803
00:35:52,109 --> 00:35:54,243
The commissioner
overruled that decision.

804
00:35:54,245 --> 00:35:56,545
Cecil Colby's being released.

805
00:36:04,683 --> 00:36:06,793
I'm never the first one here.

806
00:36:06,794 --> 00:36:08,193
Where have you been?

807
00:36:08,195 --> 00:36:10,483
Didn't get much sleep last night.

808
00:36:10,965 --> 00:36:12,020
I tried calling you,

809
00:36:12,033 --> 00:36:13,892
but I think something's
up with your phone.

810
00:36:13,968 --> 00:36:17,774
Yeah. Sam tried forwarding
my calls or something.

811
00:36:17,838 --> 00:36:20,000
Turns out he has zero
actual office skills,

812
00:36:20,007 --> 00:36:22,097
but he does have great
taste in male models.

813
00:36:22,717 --> 00:36:24,683
And I didn't sleep much, either.

814
00:36:24,685 --> 00:36:26,485
Because of the male models?

815
00:36:27,127 --> 00:36:28,554
Because of you...

816
00:36:29,473 --> 00:36:31,603
...and how totally stupid
it is to let your emotions

817
00:36:31,609 --> 00:36:33,147
influence your business decisions.

818
00:36:33,244 --> 00:36:35,978
I mean, that's, like,
introductory business strategy.

819
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:38,147
<i>But</i> the point is...

820
00:36:39,028 --> 00:36:40,683
you caught me off guard last night.

821
00:36:41,065 --> 00:36:43,165
Yeah, I wasn't, uh,

822
00:36:43,167 --> 00:36:46,568
exactly planning for
it to happen that way.

823
00:36:46,570 --> 00:36:48,604
Me, either.

824
00:36:48,606 --> 00:36:50,772
But I thought about it.

825
00:36:50,774 --> 00:36:53,809
About the fact that you came
into this company for me,

826
00:36:53,811 --> 00:36:56,111
that you'd walk away for me,

827
00:36:56,113 --> 00:36:58,413
and how you helped save my life...

828
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:01,717
...and how you wanted to marry me,

829
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:03,285
even with bangs.

830
00:37:04,989 --> 00:37:06,321
I know you told me

831
00:37:06,323 --> 00:37:09,725
that I could take
all the time I needed, but...

832
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:11,460
I don't need it.

833
00:37:15,266 --> 00:37:16,765
Let's do this.

834
00:37:21,939 --> 00:37:24,806
I kind of thought you might
kiss me or something, but...

835
00:37:32,216 --> 00:37:34,750
Great, Sam... Late for work<i> again.</i>

836
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:36,718
Morning, sunshine.

837
00:37:38,822 --> 00:37:41,056
What are you doing here? Where's Steven?

838
00:37:41,434 --> 00:37:43,191
He's at his interview.

839
00:37:43,193 --> 00:37:46,361
I, uh, watched a few minutes online
while you were in the shower.

840
00:37:48,065 --> 00:37:49,765
He's pretty good, actually.

841
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:53,268
But I wanted to talk to<i> you.</i>

842
00:37:57,508 --> 00:37:59,541
Trying to sneak out?

843
00:37:59,543 --> 00:38:02,611
Um... honestly, this place is so big,

844
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:03,949
I forgot where I came in.

845
00:38:04,815 --> 00:38:06,648
Well, I'm glad I caught you.

846
00:38:06,650 --> 00:38:08,317
I wanted to thank you for today.

847
00:38:08,399 --> 00:38:10,432
You took a leap of faith on Steven.

848
00:38:10,434 --> 00:38:13,736
Well, it's not much of a leap
when I trust your judgment.

849
00:38:14,905 --> 00:38:17,306
You know I did it for you, Cristal.

850
00:38:17,882 --> 00:38:19,208
I know.

851
00:38:19,986 --> 00:38:21,643
I have to admit, I didn't expect much,

852
00:38:21,645 --> 00:38:25,748
- but... the guy won me over.
- He even impressed Blake.

853
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:29,585
Don't tell anyone I told you that,
especially not my husband.

854
00:38:29,587 --> 00:38:31,987
I can keep a secret.

855
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:43,118
- Got a minute?
- Are you genetically incapable of knocking,

856
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:45,554
or is that more of a nurture thing?

857
00:38:45,556 --> 00:38:47,656
Mr. Colby, I'm calling
from Township First Bank

858
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:48,824
regarding an exciting new offer...

859
00:38:49,154 --> 00:38:50,258
Hey, Jeff. It's Andrew.

860
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:52,361
- Just confirming our session for Wednesday.
- What is this?

861
00:38:52,363 --> 00:38:55,063
Hey, where are you?
I've been trying you all night.

862
00:38:55,065 --> 00:38:58,867
Anyway, I pulled out all the stops,
and I think she fell for it.

863
00:38:58,869 --> 00:39:01,236
Ugh. I still hate lying to her,
but I trust you.

864
00:39:01,238 --> 00:39:03,472
So go get a rock on that finger.

865
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:07,843
I looked through his files,
I tried getting into his e-mail,

866
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:10,645
but the guy doesn't exactly
leave passwords lying around.

867
00:39:10,647 --> 00:39:12,414
He's a tech genius, after all.

868
00:39:12,416 --> 00:39:14,116
Sam, on the other hand, is not.

869
00:39:14,118 --> 00:39:16,184
He tried forwarding
the phones to his cell,

870
00:39:16,186 --> 00:39:18,954
but ended up forwarding all
of Jeff's messages to me.

871
00:39:20,591 --> 00:39:22,391
You were right.

872
00:39:22,393 --> 00:39:24,192
Jeff's playing me.

873
00:39:24,194 --> 00:39:26,294
And Monica, too.

874
00:39:28,603 --> 00:39:29,731
Why?

875
00:39:29,733 --> 00:39:31,299
I'm gonna find out.

876
00:39:31,301 --> 00:39:33,535
And once I do...

877
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:36,271
Jeff Colby is going down.

878
00:39:45,659 --> 00:39:46,743
_

879
00:39:48,395 --> 00:39:50,020
_

880
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:51,945
_

881
00:40:07,412 --> 00:40:08,703
Ted...

882
00:40:09,031 --> 00:40:10,071
are you high?

883
00:40:10,708 --> 00:40:11,811
Don't tell anybody.

884
00:40:11,842 --> 00:40:14,309
I told Steven that I
was back on the wagon.

885
00:40:15,014 --> 00:40:17,512
Look, I'm sorry that you're having...

886
00:40:17,514 --> 00:40:18,880
issues.

887
00:40:18,882 --> 00:40:21,817
And I can call someone
if you need me to, but right now,

888
00:40:21,819 --> 00:40:23,985
I need to go to work,
and you need to leave.

889
00:40:23,987 --> 00:40:27,222
Come on, you don't need a job
when you have a Carrington.

890
00:40:27,224 --> 00:40:28,590
We're not together.

891
00:40:29,264 --> 00:40:31,059
If Steven doesn't want you back,

892
00:40:31,061 --> 00:40:33,662
it's not because of me,
it's because of you.

893
00:40:33,664 --> 00:40:35,597
You think I'm so pathetic...

894
00:40:36,463 --> 00:40:37,599
don't you?

895
00:40:38,381 --> 00:40:39,501
No, I think you need help.

896
00:40:39,503 --> 00:40:40,753
And I'm calling the police.

897
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:42,065
So you can get me out of the way?

898
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:45,674
I'm sure that would make both
you and Steven very happy.

899
00:40:45,676 --> 00:40:47,409
Yeah, go ahead, just call the cops.

900
00:40:47,411 --> 00:40:48,877
And you can tell them

901
00:40:48,879 --> 00:40:50,579
that there is a crazy
man in your apartment,

902
00:40:50,581 --> 00:40:54,749
and you had to do what... you had to do.

903
00:40:56,653 --> 00:40:58,453
What are you doing?! Aah!

904
00:40:58,455 --> 00:41:00,989
- What the hell?!
- My life may be over,

905
00:41:00,991 --> 00:41:02,791
but I am not going down alone.

906
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:05,193
I'm taking you and Steven down with me.

907
00:41:05,562 --> 00:41:06,895
Ted? Ted!

908
00:41:06,897 --> 00:41:08,363
Ted!

909
00:41:13,284 --> 00:41:14,069
What's going on?

910
00:41:18,408 --> 00:41:20,142
Sam?

911
00:41:20,945 --> 00:41:21,743
Sam?

912
00:41:21,783 --> 00:41:23,097
