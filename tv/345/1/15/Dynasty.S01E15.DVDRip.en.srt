1
00:01:52,738 --> 00:01:55,969
Steven, how could you say that?

2
00:01:56,075 --> 00:01:58,566
How could you say
what you did in there? That I lied?

3
00:01:58,678 --> 00:02:03,911
It's the truth, isn't it?
Fallon, it's judgment day for all of us.

4
00:02:04,016 --> 00:02:06,576
You trust Blake Carrington's life
to those 12 strangers...

5
00:02:06,686 --> 00:02:10,122
in that box that
could put our father away?

6
00:02:10,222 --> 00:02:14,124
Your lying's not going to help him.
My lying?

7
00:02:14,226 --> 00:02:16,319
Since when
are you so truthful?

8
00:02:16,429 --> 00:02:18,829
You told Daddy you were going to change,
and then you had that guy around again.

9
00:02:18,931 --> 00:02:23,368
His name was Ted.
What did you expect your father to do...

10
00:02:23,469 --> 00:02:26,336
when he walked into your room
and found you and Ted together?

11
00:02:26,439 --> 00:02:28,964
I expected him maybe,just maybe,
for once in his life...

12
00:02:29,075 --> 00:02:31,839
to listen to me and to the truth.

13
00:02:31,944 --> 00:02:35,971
Whose truth? Yours? His?

14
00:02:36,082 --> 00:02:39,017
Tell me something, Steven.
Did you do all this on purpose?

15
00:02:39,118 --> 00:02:41,916
Do you want your revenge
on Blake Carrington that badly...

16
00:02:42,021 --> 00:02:44,683
<i>to see him in that courtroom,
in that chair, facing thatjury?</i>

17
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:47,122
<i>Is that what you wanted?
No.</i>

18
00:02:47,226 --> 00:02:52,027
I'll tell you something something
I've begun to think and to feel.

19
00:02:52,131 --> 00:02:57,228
<i>You are the guilty one. You're as guilty
as anyone else of Ted Dinard's death.</i>

20
00:02:57,336 --> 00:03:02,797
<i>You allowed him into your father's house.
You practically invited him to die...</i>

21
00:03:02,908 --> 00:03:06,708
your friend, your lover
your dead lover.

22
00:03:24,764 --> 00:03:28,165
<i>[ Andrew ] I won't allow it, Blake.!
I won't let you do it.! It's suicide.!</i>

23
00:03:28,267 --> 00:03:31,259
I'll take my chances on that.
I'll take my chances on the jury.

24
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:33,270
After all, it's my right
to get up in front of them...

25
00:03:33,372 --> 00:03:36,273
tell them my side,
what I did or did not do.

26
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:40,141
You're crazy, you know that?
Because that is not the way it's done!

27
00:03:40,246 --> 00:03:43,841
This isn't your boardroom,
where you can exercise control!

28
00:03:43,949 --> 00:03:46,383
Andrew, you listen to me,
and you listen well!

29
00:03:46,485 --> 00:03:50,182
You are still on my payroll!
You still work for me!

30
00:03:53,826 --> 00:03:57,318
Krystle, will you try
to talk some sense into him?

31
00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:01,457
Defendants have been known to say
one wrong thing and destroy their own case!

32
00:04:01,567 --> 00:04:05,799
I'm sorry, Andrew, but if Blake thinks
that's best, I have to go along with him.

33
00:04:05,905 --> 00:04:08,738
<i>Oh, sure you do. Have my father
screw up his own case.</i>

34
00:04:08,841 --> 00:04:12,208
He ends up in jail. You get everything you want.
Fallon, watch your mouth.

35
00:04:12,311 --> 00:04:14,643
You stay out of this.
You're not part of this family.

36
00:04:14,747 --> 00:04:16,806
I don't need Jeff
to defend me, Fallon.

37
00:04:16,916 --> 00:04:19,749
Tell me something, Krystle.
Why did you come back that night?

38
00:04:19,852 --> 00:04:24,289
<i>You left my father that afternoon.
You were probably off with Matthew Blaisdel.</i>

39
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:29,020
Fallon!
Know what I think? I think you
came back to pick his bones.

40
00:04:29,128 --> 00:04:32,529
This afternoon was a good start.
Big lady at the board meeting.

41
00:04:32,631 --> 00:04:36,590
Gulping down that first bottle of power.
Now, that is enough!

42
00:04:36,702 --> 00:04:40,832
What she did at that meeting was tremendous.
I'm v I'm very proud of her for that.

43
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:45,240
Well, I'm not so sure she doesn't believe
you did it. What do you believe, Krystle?

44
00:04:45,344 --> 00:04:49,610
<i>[ Blake ] Now, stop it, damn it.!
My God.! Look at us.!</i>

45
00:04:49,715 --> 00:04:52,650
We were a family once.

46
00:04:53,786 --> 00:04:58,280
Now... I'm losing my son
because of this.

47
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:03,623
<i>You're losing your brother.
You two scratching at each other's eyes.</i>

48
00:05:05,764 --> 00:05:08,358
I've just insulted my best friend.

49
00:05:12,104 --> 00:05:14,937
<i>Andrew, I'm sorry.</i>

50
00:05:18,911 --> 00:05:22,938
As for my decision about whether I'll testify
or not, I'll have to let you know about that.

51
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:29,680
Yeah, well Listen, it's late.
I'd better be going.

52
00:05:31,524 --> 00:05:34,687
[ Blake ]
We'll walk you out.

53
00:05:42,668 --> 00:05:47,128
This afternoon
in that courtroom, did you lie?

54
00:05:58,918 --> 00:06:02,081
I know. I know. That's what
you've been saying all along...

55
00:06:04,523 --> 00:06:07,754
but did you lie
the way Steven said you did?

56
00:06:09,528 --> 00:06:13,624
If I did,
can't you understand why?

57
00:06:13,732 --> 00:06:16,257
Doesn't Steven?

58
00:06:16,368 --> 00:06:18,734
Doesn't he?

59
00:06:21,774 --> 00:06:24,265
Your father's right.

60
00:06:26,078 --> 00:06:28,342
You've lost your brother, Fallon.

61
00:06:29,815 --> 00:06:33,842
Jeff, what am I gonna do?

62
00:06:44,663 --> 00:06:47,689
What am I gonna do?

63
00:07:05,017 --> 00:07:09,113
Does the prosecution rest?
Yes, Your Honor.

64
00:07:10,256 --> 00:07:12,850
Mr. Laird?

65
00:07:12,958 --> 00:07:17,554
Thank you, Your Honor.
I call Joseph Arlington Aynders.

66
00:07:26,171 --> 00:07:30,073
<i>[ Andrew ] Now, Miss Jeanette Robbins,
a servant who works for you and with you...</i>

67
00:07:30,175 --> 00:07:35,169
<i>has already told this court that she was
with you in the vestibule area...</i>

68
00:07:35,281 --> 00:07:38,808
of the Carrington house
on the night of November 1 2.

69
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:41,886
Is that correct?
Yes, it is, Mr. Laird.

70
00:07:41,987 --> 00:07:46,253
<i>She also testified that when
Mr. Carrington entered the house...</i>

71
00:07:46,358 --> 00:07:50,852
and was told that his son, Steven,
was upstairs with his friend...

72
00:07:50,963 --> 00:07:55,195
his former lover,
the deceased Theodore Dinard...

73
00:07:55,301 --> 00:07:57,895
Mr. Carrington turned angry...

74
00:07:58,003 --> 00:08:01,336
and said these words: ""I'll kill him.''

75
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,968
Is that true?
No. That is definitely not true.

76
00:08:06,078 --> 00:08:11,141
I see. Will you explain that
to the court, Mr. Aynders?

77
00:08:12,551 --> 00:08:16,487
What Mr. Carrington said was,
""I'll get him.''

78
00:08:16,588 --> 00:08:19,955
<i>[ Andrew ] You're sure of that?
[Joseph ] I'm certain of it, Mr. Laird.</i>

79
00:08:20,059 --> 00:08:23,893
Just as I'm certain that what
Mr. Carrington meant by ""I'll get him''...

80
00:08:23,996 --> 00:08:25,930
was that he was going
to get him out of the house.

81
00:08:26,031 --> 00:08:28,522
Objection! The witness
is stating an opinion.

82
00:08:28,634 --> 00:08:32,798
<i>I sustain that objection.
There's no question pending.</i>

83
00:08:34,373 --> 00:08:37,706
Thank you, Mr. Aynders.
No further questions.

84
00:08:39,244 --> 00:08:43,908
Mr. Dunham, crossexamine?
Thank you, Your Honor.

85
00:08:46,852 --> 00:08:48,877
Mr. Aynders...

86
00:08:50,789 --> 00:08:56,557
well, we're into a rather critical verb
right now, aren't we, Mr. Aynders?

87
00:08:56,662 --> 00:09:01,827
The difference between ""kill'' and ""get''
or even ""get out''...

88
00:09:01,934 --> 00:09:04,368
being an exceedingly
crucial difference in this trial.

89
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:07,098
You do understand that, don't you, Mr. Aynders?
Of course.

90
00:09:07,206 --> 00:09:12,041
And it is your testimony that what you heard
was the verb ""get'' and not ""kill,'' correct?

91
00:09:12,144 --> 00:09:15,511
Yes. That's absolutely correct.
[ Dunham ] And you're sure
that that's what you heard?

92
00:09:15,614 --> 00:09:18,674
<i>[Joseph ] Absolutely sure.
Approximately how many feet
were you standing...</i>

93
00:09:18,784 --> 00:09:22,618
from the accused when he said
whatever it was he actually said?

94
00:09:22,721 --> 00:09:25,713
<i>I would say about as far as where you are
standing from me right now.
Really?</i>

95
00:09:25,824 --> 00:09:29,726
I thought he had turned and was moving
towards the staircase. Is that not a fact?

96
00:09:29,828 --> 00:09:32,524
He'd made a slight turn, yes.
Ah. A slight turn. But let's say...

97
00:09:32,631 --> 00:09:35,031
we can double the distance,
to where I'm standing now.

98
00:09:35,134 --> 00:09:37,728
Is that not correct?
That is approximately correct.

99
00:09:37,836 --> 00:09:41,567
Good. Mr. Aynders, isn't it a fact
that while you were in the army...

100
00:09:41,673 --> 00:09:45,131
serving in the 52nd Artillery,
you suffered a permanent hearing loss...

101
00:09:45,244 --> 00:09:47,212
a condition that persists to this day?

102
00:09:47,312 --> 00:09:49,610
It's true I suffered a hearing loss,
but it's minimal at best.

103
00:09:49,715 --> 00:09:52,513
<i>And yet you're insisting
that on the night of the 1 2th...</i>

104
00:09:52,618 --> 00:09:55,587
you heard Mr. Carrington
use the word ""get'' and not ""kill.''

105
00:09:55,687 --> 00:09:58,155
Yes, I am insisting
he said ""get,'' not ""kill.''

106
00:09:58,257 --> 00:10:00,953
Can you hear me now, Mr. Aynders?
Yes, I can hear you now.

107
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:03,789
[ Softly ] Can you hear me now, Mr. Aynders?
Yes, I can hear you now.

108
00:10:03,896 --> 00:10:06,387
[ Softly ] I'll kill him.
[ Louder] Did you hear that, Mr. Aynders?

109
00:10:08,901 --> 00:10:13,968
Yes, I heard that.
You just said, ""I'll kill him.''

110
00:10:21,947 --> 00:10:24,211
No further questions.

111
00:10:25,317 --> 00:10:28,878
<i>[ Quinlan ]
Witness may step down.</i>

112
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,101
<i>[ Andrew ] You were
the defendant's secretary for a year...</i>

113
00:10:44,203 --> 00:10:47,536
<i>and then you became his wife
and have been for the last 1 0 months.</i>

114
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:53,134
Is that true, Mrs. Carrington?
Yes. That's true.

115
00:10:53,245 --> 00:10:56,772
So it's a fair statement
to make not an assumption...

116
00:10:56,882 --> 00:11:02,514
but a statement of fact that you know
the defendant very well, correct?

117
00:11:02,621 --> 00:11:06,717
He's my husband, and, yes, I know him
I know him very well.

118
00:11:06,825 --> 00:11:10,192
Have you ever, in all the time
you've known the defendant...

119
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:13,856
known him
to have a violent disposition?

120
00:11:19,605 --> 00:11:21,664
No.

121
00:11:21,773 --> 00:11:26,142
<i>[ Andrew ] But he does get angry, however,
does he not, from time to time?</i>

122
00:11:26,245 --> 00:11:28,907
<i>[ Krystle ]
Well, he does. Of course.</i>

123
00:11:29,014 --> 00:11:34,452
Would you tell us, Mrs. Carrington,
the extent of his anger...

124
00:11:34,553 --> 00:11:38,250
as you have personally observed it?

125
00:11:41,593 --> 00:11:46,860
Well, he gets moody
and argumentative...

126
00:11:46,965 --> 00:11:50,332
like most people
Mmhmm.

127
00:11:50,435 --> 00:11:53,427
especially when
he's under pressure.

128
00:11:53,539 --> 00:11:58,101
<i>[ Andrew ] Would you say
overly moody and argumentative?</i>

129
00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:00,201
<i>[ Krystle ] No.</i>

130
00:12:00,312 --> 00:12:03,406
<i>[ Andrew ] And never violent.
Is that correct?</i>

131
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:06,877
That's correct.

132
00:12:06,985 --> 00:12:12,218
Mrs. Carrington, would you say
that Mr. Carrington loves you?

133
00:12:26,405 --> 00:12:28,930
<i>Mrs. Carrington?</i>

134
00:12:31,343 --> 00:12:33,311
Yes, he does.

135
00:12:35,314 --> 00:12:38,249
<i>[ Andrew ] Does he love his son,
Steven Carrington?</i>

136
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:54,695
Yes. Very much.

137
00:12:56,201 --> 00:12:58,669
He loves his son very much.

138
00:13:03,809 --> 00:13:08,269
Thank you, Mrs. Carrington.
No further questions.

139
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:12,009
[ Quinlan ]
The witness may step down.

140
00:13:17,689 --> 00:13:21,147
[ Sighs ]
I call Sarah Pat Beecham.

141
00:13:26,031 --> 00:13:30,764
Andrew, is that the girl
you talked about?

142
00:13:30,869 --> 00:13:34,771
Blake, this is not going to work.
She's not a credible witness.

143
00:13:34,873 --> 00:13:39,901
She's a hooker. Please.
Let me call Claudia Blaisdel.
No.

144
00:13:40,012 --> 00:13:42,674
<i>[ Clerk ] Do you solemnly swear that
the testimony you may give before this court...</i>

145
00:13:42,781 --> 00:13:46,478
shall be the truth, the whole truth and
nothing but the truth, so help you God?

146
00:13:46,585 --> 00:13:48,985
<i>[ Beecham ]
I do.</i>

147
00:13:51,823 --> 00:13:55,281
Do you have the Blaisdel subpoena ready?
Yes, but Mr. Carrington said

148
00:13:55,394 --> 00:14:00,093
Never mind what Mr. Carrington said. You
watch me and you be ready to go when I tell you.

149
00:14:00,198 --> 00:14:02,359
Yeah.

150
00:14:09,741 --> 00:14:14,178
<i>I work over in Lagorda.
I'm a masseuse there.</i>

151
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:17,942
I give rubdowns and stuff like that.
""And stuff like that.'' Yes.

152
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:21,144
Now, Miss Beecham,
prior to your working in Lagorda...

153
00:14:21,253 --> 00:14:25,383
you were a masseuse in Brisas,
is that not a fact?

154
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:29,221
Yes, it is.
I left a couple of weeks ago.

155
00:14:29,327 --> 00:14:32,296
Just sort of a change
of locations.

156
00:14:32,397 --> 00:14:35,127
Now, while you were working
in Brisas, did you ever...

157
00:14:35,233 --> 00:14:38,134
have a customer
named Steven Carrington?

158
00:14:38,236 --> 00:14:43,173
I did. Yes, that's right.

159
00:14:43,275 --> 00:14:46,244
Now, would you tell us when
he came to you for a massage?

160
00:14:46,344 --> 00:14:50,576
I don't remember the exact date,
but it was summertime.

161
00:14:50,682 --> 00:14:55,176
And during the course of the
excuse me

162
00:14:55,287 --> 00:15:00,554
<i>following the massage,
would you tell us what happened?</i>

163
00:15:00,659 --> 00:15:05,358
I mean, did he thank you
and pay you and leave?

164
00:15:05,464 --> 00:15:08,433
No. Not exactly, sir.

165
00:15:08,533 --> 00:15:13,561
Would you tell the court
and the jury exactly what did happen?

166
00:15:16,108 --> 00:15:19,366
<i>We made love together.</i>

167
00:15:19,678 --> 00:15:24,445
<i>Are you saying that you had
sexual relations with Steven Carrington?</i>

168
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:26,744
Yes.

169
00:15:30,589 --> 00:15:34,548
<i>Now, Miss Beecham,
at this time...</i>

170
00:15:34,659 --> 00:15:40,427
did it appear to you that
Steven Carrington was a homosexual?

171
00:15:40,532 --> 00:15:43,899
You mean gay? Oh, no.

172
00:15:44,002 --> 00:15:48,939
I mean, not with me he wasn't.
How could he be? I mean

173
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,668
What do you mean, Miss Beecham?

174
00:15:51,777 --> 00:15:56,680
He stayed half an hour
over the time limit...

175
00:15:56,782 --> 00:15:59,880
you know, for the massage?

176
00:16:09,528 --> 00:16:15,262
Miss Beecham, did Mr. Steven Carrington
ever come to see you again in Brisas?

177
00:16:15,367 --> 00:16:17,892
I mean, after that first encounter.

178
00:16:18,003 --> 00:16:20,995
Yes, he did. Quite a few times,
as a matter of fact.

179
00:16:22,541 --> 00:16:26,068
Thank you.
No further questions, Your Honor.

180
00:16:27,379 --> 00:16:29,472
Mr. Dunham, crossexamine?

181
00:16:30,882 --> 00:16:32,975
Oh, yes.

182
00:16:33,084 --> 00:16:35,484
Miss Beecham,
you say that you are a masseuse.

183
00:16:35,587 --> 00:16:38,681
Is that correct?
Yes, that's correct.

184
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:41,486
Isn't it more correct to say
that you were a prostitute...

185
00:16:41,593 --> 00:16:44,153
<i>that you work in a house
of prostitution?</i>

186
00:16:44,262 --> 00:16:46,696
<i>Objection, Your Honor. The prosecution
[ Dunham ] Your Honor...</i>

187
00:16:46,798 --> 00:16:48,766
I am merely trying to establish
that the witness is admittedly engaged...

188
00:16:48,867 --> 00:16:51,836
in a line of work which is a felony
in the state of Colorado.

189
00:16:51,937 --> 00:16:55,668
And therefore her testimony in this court
or any other court is virtually worthless.

190
00:16:55,774 --> 00:16:59,301
<i>[ Quinlan ]
Please answer the question, Miss Beecham.</i>

191
00:16:59,411 --> 00:17:02,073
Now, Miss Beecham,
would you tell this court and this jury...

192
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:04,876
what it is
that you do for a living?

193
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:15,258
I do anything you like.

194
00:17:23,168 --> 00:17:26,569
Thank you.
No more questions.

195
00:17:31,443 --> 00:17:35,106
<i>[ Quinlan ]
The witness may step down.</i>

196
00:17:39,251 --> 00:17:42,379
Go now, and fast.
Take a deputy sheriff with you.

197
00:17:42,487 --> 00:17:45,388
I don't wanna give her a chance to run.
Right.

198
00:17:51,296 --> 00:17:54,527
What do they want with me?
I mean, I can't tell them anything.

199
00:17:54,633 --> 00:17:57,466
There's nothing else
I can tell you, ma'am. It's a lawful order...

200
00:17:57,569 --> 00:18:00,902
and you've got to come with us.

201
00:18:01,006 --> 00:18:06,376
May I take my car?
Well, it's been requested that you come with us.

202
00:18:06,478 --> 00:18:09,914
<i>My daughter's still in school, and
That won't be a problem.</i>

203
00:18:10,015 --> 00:18:12,779
You'll be finished
before she gets out.

204
00:18:12,884 --> 00:18:15,375
Can I at least
call my husband?

205
00:18:16,488 --> 00:18:18,422
Sure.

206
00:18:41,313 --> 00:18:44,908
Yeah?
[ Claudia ] Matthew, it's me.

207
00:18:45,016 --> 00:18:48,179
Claudia, you okay?

208
00:18:49,421 --> 00:18:52,913
I just called
to say that I loved you.

209
00:18:54,693 --> 00:18:58,288
What's the matter?
I know I've always been a problem to you...

210
00:18:58,396 --> 00:19:00,830
ever since the day that we met.

211
00:19:00,932 --> 00:19:04,959
It's gonna be better this way.
Which way? What the hell you talkin' about?

212
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:07,561
What's goin' on?
I love you.

213
00:19:07,672 --> 00:19:10,436
[ Matthew ]
Claudia? Claudia?

214
00:20:01,393 --> 00:20:03,588
Yeah?
Matthew?

215
00:20:05,997 --> 00:20:11,196
Matthew. Matthew, it's Jake
Jake Dunham. Listen.

216
00:20:11,302 --> 00:20:14,271
I don't have much time. I think
you'd better get down here right away.

217
00:20:14,372 --> 00:20:19,571
Blake Carrington has just
called Claudia as a defense witness.

218
00:20:19,677 --> 00:20:23,704
Now, look, if it's what I think it is,
it's gonna be very rough on her.

219
00:20:23,815 --> 00:20:26,375
I've already talked to the bailiff.
They'll let you through
as soon as you get here.

220
00:20:26,484 --> 00:20:31,649
Matthew?
Yeah. I'll be there,Jake.

221
00:20:41,299 --> 00:20:44,132
I call Claudia Blaisdel.

222
00:20:54,646 --> 00:20:59,379
I told you not to do this.
I thought we had an understanding.

223
00:21:01,286 --> 00:21:05,882
Blake, you and I have only
one understanding: to keep you out of jail.

224
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:10,825
Now, you have two choices:
to go along with me or to fire me.

225
00:21:24,042 --> 00:21:26,840
<i>[ Clerk ] Do you solemnly swear that
the testimony you may give before this court...</i>

226
00:21:26,945 --> 00:21:30,472
<i>shall be the truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</i>

227
00:21:30,582 --> 00:21:33,312
I do.

228
00:21:33,418 --> 00:21:38,856
<i>Do you know the defendant, Blake Carrington?
[ Claudia ] Yes.</i>

229
00:21:38,957 --> 00:21:43,587
<i>[ Andrew ] And his son,
Steven Carrington, Mrs. Blaisdel?</i>

230
00:21:43,695 --> 00:21:48,325
<i>[ Claudia ] Yes.
Did you know the deceased, Ted Dinard?</i>

231
00:21:50,535 --> 00:21:52,662
I met him once.

232
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:55,671
When was that, Mrs. Blaisdel?

233
00:21:56,875 --> 00:21:59,105
The night before he died.

234
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:02,043
<i>[ Andrew ]
Would you tell us where, please?</i>

235
00:22:02,147 --> 00:22:05,708
He came to the store
where I was working.

236
00:22:05,817 --> 00:22:08,786
<i>And?
[ Claudia ] We talked.</i>

237
00:22:08,887 --> 00:22:11,185
About what, Mrs. Blaisdel?

238
00:22:14,325 --> 00:22:18,489
<i>[ Claudia ]
Just things. Things.</i>

239
00:22:19,864 --> 00:22:23,027
<i>Did you talk
about Steven Carrington?</i>

240
00:22:24,135 --> 00:22:26,194
Yes.

241
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:31,742
What did you talk about?
Did you have an argument of some kind?

242
00:22:33,411 --> 00:22:35,379
Yes.

243
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:39,211
Will you
describe the argument, please?

244
00:22:39,317 --> 00:22:42,616
Um, more or less...

245
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:48,215
Mr. Dinard had come out
from New York to Denver.

246
00:22:48,326 --> 00:22:52,888
He wanted to talk Steven
into going back with him.

247
00:22:52,997 --> 00:22:57,900
I said that I didn't think that he should
get involved in such a decision.

248
00:22:58,002 --> 00:23:01,768
You knew Steven Carrington and Ted Dinard
had had a brief homosexual relationship...

249
00:23:01,873 --> 00:23:06,003
in New York in Steven Carrington's past
is that not a fact?

250
00:23:07,378 --> 00:23:09,539
Yes.

251
00:23:09,647 --> 00:23:15,244
<i>[ Andrew ] So why did you try to discourage
a continuation of their relationship?</i>

252
00:23:15,353 --> 00:23:20,552
Because I knew that Steven was
He was thinking about his life.

253
00:23:21,659 --> 00:23:24,389
Are you talking
about his sexuality...

254
00:23:24,495 --> 00:23:28,090
his choice of lifestyles
concerning his sexuality?

255
00:23:28,199 --> 00:23:30,565
Yes.

256
00:23:30,668 --> 00:23:33,831
Now, this is
a difficult question...

257
00:23:33,938 --> 00:23:37,499
for you to answer,
Mrs. Blaisdel, I know...

258
00:23:37,609 --> 00:23:40,942
but please forgive me.

259
00:23:41,045 --> 00:23:43,275
I'm sorry.

260
00:23:43,381 --> 00:23:47,317
By the time of your meeting
with Ted Dinard...

261
00:23:47,418 --> 00:23:49,579
the night before his death...

262
00:23:49,687 --> 00:23:52,986
how well had you
come to know Steven Carrington?

263
00:23:54,492 --> 00:23:58,155
<i>Very well.
Would you explain that, please?</i>

264
00:23:59,631 --> 00:24:02,566
I don't know how else
to say it. We...

265
00:24:02,667 --> 00:24:06,262
got to know each other
very well... as friends.

266
00:24:06,371 --> 00:24:10,603
Were you not in fact having an affair
with Steven Carrington at this time?

267
00:24:13,911 --> 00:24:17,472
<i>[ Laird Sighs ]
I'll repeat the question.</i>

268
00:24:17,582 --> 00:24:21,678
Were you not in fact having
an affair with Steven at this time?

269
00:24:21,786 --> 00:24:25,620
[ Quietly ]
Please, Mr. Laird...

270
00:24:25,723 --> 00:24:27,953
I'm a married woman.

271
00:24:28,059 --> 00:24:31,859
I have a husband,
and I have a daughter...

272
00:24:31,963 --> 00:24:33,863
and they mean everything to me.

273
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:40,901
I know that, Mrs. Blaisdel,
and... I'm sorry.

274
00:24:41,005 --> 00:24:44,372
Again, please forgive me,
but you'll have to answer my question.

275
00:24:44,475 --> 00:24:48,206
<i>What are you trying to do?
[ Bailiff] Sir, sit down.!</i>

276
00:24:48,313 --> 00:24:50,304
No. I wanna know
what you're trying to do.

277
00:24:50,415 --> 00:24:54,545
Mr. Carrington, you will please sit down,
or I'll have you removed from this courtroom.

278
00:25:07,832 --> 00:25:11,962
[ Smacks Lips ]
Mrs. Blaisdel, I'll repeat the question:

279
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:17,303
<i>Did you eventually engage
in sexual relations with the defendant's son?</i>

280
00:25:19,811 --> 00:25:21,711
[ Quietly ]
Yes.

281
00:25:21,813 --> 00:25:25,146
<i>[ Andrew ] Would you tell the
court on how many occasions...</i>

282
00:25:25,249 --> 00:25:27,149
<i>this occurred
with Steven Carrington?</i>

283
00:25:27,251 --> 00:25:29,219
<i>[ Claudia ]
Several.</i>

284
00:25:33,558 --> 00:25:35,458
<i>[ Andrew ]
Mrs. Blaisdel...</i>

285
00:25:36,994 --> 00:25:40,395
<i>I must remind you
that you are under sworn oath.</i>

286
00:25:43,534 --> 00:25:45,559
<i>How many?</i>

287
00:25:50,341 --> 00:25:52,241
Several.

288
00:25:53,678 --> 00:25:55,703
<i>[ Andrew ]
How many times?</i>

289
00:25:55,813 --> 00:25:59,271
<i>[ Claudia ] I don't remember
how many times. I just said several.</i>

290
00:25:59,384 --> 00:26:03,013
<i>[ Andrew ]
Uh, where did this occur?</i>

291
00:26:03,121 --> 00:26:06,318
<i>Do you remember where,
Mrs. Blaisdel?</i>

292
00:26:06,424 --> 00:26:10,087
It occurredyes

293
00:26:10,194 --> 00:26:14,631
the first time at his cabin
on Manchester Lake.

294
00:26:15,733 --> 00:26:19,430
<i>[ Andrew ]
And after that?</i>

295
00:26:19,537 --> 00:26:21,437
<i>[ Claudia ]
At his apartment.</i>

296
00:26:21,539 --> 00:26:24,872
He had an apartment.
We met at his apartment.

297
00:26:24,976 --> 00:26:30,209
<i>So you continued to have sexual
relations with him there in his apartment?</i>

298
00:26:32,817 --> 00:26:35,081
Yes.

299
00:26:35,186 --> 00:26:38,815
<i>[ Andrew ] Now, as has
has already been mentioned...</i>

300
00:26:38,923 --> 00:26:43,292
<i>he admittedly had
a briefhomosexual past...</i>

301
00:26:43,394 --> 00:26:45,294
history.

302
00:26:45,396 --> 00:26:50,663
Now, would you say, Mrs. Blaisdel,
that during your assignations with him...

303
00:26:50,768 --> 00:26:53,760
that he showed any signs
of his past history?

304
00:26:53,871 --> 00:26:55,771
<i>[ Dunham ]
Objection.</i>

305
00:26:55,873 --> 00:26:59,969
Question calls for a conclusion
on the part of the witness. Your Honor...

306
00:27:00,077 --> 00:27:02,204
this entire line
of questioning is irrelevant.

307
00:27:02,313 --> 00:27:05,339
Virtually any homosexual is capable
of a relationship with a woman...

308
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:07,611
depending upon his frame of mind.

309
00:27:07,718 --> 00:27:09,743
Sustained.

310
00:27:09,854 --> 00:27:12,755
Will you, uh, please rephrase
the question, Mr. Laird?

311
00:27:12,857 --> 00:27:17,021
All right. I'll put it
in more positive terms.

312
00:27:17,128 --> 00:27:19,926
Mrs. Blaisdel, would you say
that Steven Carrington...

313
00:27:20,031 --> 00:27:24,525
<i>is a thoroughly and totally
normal heterosexual partner?</i>

314
00:27:27,672 --> 00:27:31,631
[ Sighs ]
Yes, I would.

315
00:27:31,742 --> 00:27:35,735
<i>[ Andrew ]
Thank you. No further questions.</i>

316
00:27:35,847 --> 00:27:38,111
Sir, would you please
find yourself a seat?

317
00:27:42,053 --> 00:27:44,981
Bailiff, get that man to sit down.

318
00:28:03,741 --> 00:28:05,868
You had to do it,
didn't you, Blake? Didn't you?

319
00:28:05,977 --> 00:28:07,877
You had to do it to her,
didn't you, Blake?

320
00:28:07,979 --> 00:28:11,176
How many more [ Indistinct ]
I want that man arrested. Get him out of here.

321
00:28:11,282 --> 00:28:15,218
<i>Get him out of this courtroom.
You had to do it, didn't you?
Why her, Blake? Why her?</i>

322
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:18,652
<i>How many more, Blake?
Get him out ofhere.
Get him out of this courtroom.!</i>

323
00:28:18,756 --> 00:28:21,020
<i>Claudia!
Get him out ofhere.</i>

324
00:28:21,125 --> 00:28:23,025
Claudia!

325
00:28:23,127 --> 00:28:26,824
<i>Claudia, don't. Somebody stop her.
She's liable to do something wrong.!</i>

326
00:28:26,931 --> 00:28:31,425
Don't let her leave.
She's liable to do something! Claudia!

327
00:28:31,536 --> 00:28:33,436
<i>Claudia.!</i>

328
00:28:33,538 --> 00:28:36,632
You all right?
Yes. Yes. II'm all right. I'm fine.

329
00:28:36,741 --> 00:28:39,005
Thank you.

330
00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:41,078
Okay.

331
00:29:01,399 --> 00:29:04,664
Oh, Lindsay.
I'm glad you're back.

332
00:29:04,769 --> 00:29:06,669
Listen, we're going away. Come on.
What?

333
00:29:06,771 --> 00:29:10,502
I'll explain to you later.
Don't ask any questions. I
What's happening?

334
00:29:10,608 --> 00:29:13,372
Lindsay, I just need you now.
Get in the car.

335
00:29:44,273 --> 00:29:47,867
Mr. Laird,
will you call your next witness?

336
00:29:50,114 --> 00:29:52,173
Blake, I don't want to do it.

337
00:29:52,283 --> 00:29:54,251
Do it.

338
00:29:59,023 --> 00:30:01,823
I call Blake Carrington.

339
00:30:05,396 --> 00:30:10,424
Yes, I have two children:
my daughter, Fallon, and my son, Steven.

340
00:30:10,534 --> 00:30:13,196
<i>Is it not a fact that
some 1 6 years ago...</i>

341
00:30:13,304 --> 00:30:16,865
your first wife, their mother,
abandoned her children?

342
00:30:17,975 --> 00:30:19,875
Yes. That's correct.

343
00:30:19,977 --> 00:30:22,502
<i>Would you say that you have ever
neglected your children?</i>

344
00:30:22,613 --> 00:30:26,913
I mean, obviously,
you're a very busy man.

345
00:30:27,018 --> 00:30:30,044
Business concerns
take up much of your time.

346
00:30:30,154 --> 00:30:34,386
Would you say that you've been a good father
to them over these past 1 6 years?

347
00:30:36,293 --> 00:30:42,232
Is anyone ever good enough?
I've tried, but I wish I'd been a better father.

348
00:30:42,333 --> 00:30:44,995
What kind of work
does your son do?

349
00:30:46,137 --> 00:30:48,298
He works for me
in one of my refineries.

350
00:30:48,406 --> 00:30:50,533
How much does he earn there?

351
00:30:50,641 --> 00:30:54,168
Oh, I think in the neighborhood
of $250 a week.

352
00:30:55,446 --> 00:30:57,414
Isn't it a fact that
you could have given him...

353
00:30:57,515 --> 00:31:01,042
a job at your office
at a much higher salary?

354
00:31:01,152 --> 00:31:06,613
Yes, but I had started at the bottom
and worked my way up...

355
00:31:06,724 --> 00:31:08,783
and that was the way
Steven chose to do it.

356
00:31:08,893 --> 00:31:11,157
I I admired him for that.

357
00:31:15,499 --> 00:31:17,399
Do you love your son,
Mr. Carrington?

358
00:31:19,303 --> 00:31:22,101
Yes. I love Steven very much.

359
00:31:22,206 --> 00:31:24,174
<i>[ Andrew ]
Would it then be correct to say...</i>

360
00:31:24,275 --> 00:31:27,073
<i>that because of your love
for your son...</i>

361
00:31:27,178 --> 00:31:31,774
<i>you tried to protect him from
an abnormal lifea life ofhomosexuality</i>

362
00:31:31,882 --> 00:31:36,012
a life that he had
experimented with briefly...

363
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:38,645
<i>and was now obviously
turning away from?</i>

364
00:31:38,756 --> 00:31:43,693
Yes. Steven had been involved
with Ted Dinard in New York...

365
00:31:43,794 --> 00:31:46,524
but he'd come home
to straighten out his life

366
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:49,258
to fulfill himself as a as a man.

367
00:31:49,366 --> 00:31:55,305
And then, uninvited by your son,
Ted Dinard came to Denver is that true?

368
00:31:55,406 --> 00:31:58,739
<i>Yes.
Now, on the night of November 1 2...</i>

369
00:31:58,843 --> 00:32:04,281
<i>when you learned that Ted Dinard was
in the house, what did you feel?</i>

370
00:32:05,516 --> 00:32:09,282
I, uh I felt angry.

371
00:32:11,021 --> 00:32:13,785
<i>[ Andrew ] What did you say when
you heard he was in the house?</i>

372
00:32:14,892 --> 00:32:17,656
Well, I think I said that

373
00:32:18,796 --> 00:32:21,959
I believe I said,
""I'll I'll get him.''

374
00:32:22,066 --> 00:32:27,060
But... I might have said, ""I'll kill him.''
I don't remember which.

375
00:32:27,171 --> 00:32:30,504
<i>In either case,
what did you have in mind..</i>

376
00:32:30,608 --> 00:32:33,509
when you said
whichever of the two phrases?

377
00:32:33,611 --> 00:32:34,645
Was it to hurt him?
No.

378
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,237
Was it to hurt him?
No.

379
00:32:36,347 --> 00:32:39,578
<i>Or was it simply
to get him out of your son's life?</i>

380
00:32:39,683 --> 00:32:41,913
Yes. Yes, that's
exactly what it was.

381
00:32:43,888 --> 00:32:47,949
Would you Would you please
tell us what then happened?

382
00:32:50,461 --> 00:32:54,727
[ Exhales ]
I climbed the stairs, and I...

383
00:32:54,832 --> 00:32:57,630
entered Steven's room, and...

384
00:32:57,735 --> 00:33:02,399
I saw Mr. Dinard...
putting his arms around my son.

385
00:33:04,441 --> 00:33:06,841
<i>[ Andrew ] Now,
according to your son's testimony...</i>

386
00:33:06,944 --> 00:33:10,971
they had decided that Ted Dinard
would leave Denver alone...

387
00:33:11,081 --> 00:33:14,016
and they were saying goodbye
to one another.

388
00:33:14,118 --> 00:33:17,315
Did you have any knowledge
of this at that time?

389
00:33:17,421 --> 00:33:19,389
No. No, I did not.

390
00:33:20,491 --> 00:33:22,459
You did not

391
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:24,528
did not.

392
00:33:28,032 --> 00:33:31,365
Would you, um,
tell us what happened then?

393
00:33:32,770 --> 00:33:37,571
Well, I ordered Mr. Dinard
to take his hands off my son.

394
00:33:37,675 --> 00:33:43,409
And was there any moment of physical activity
any moment of violence...

395
00:33:43,514 --> 00:33:46,574
between you and Mr. Dinard
after that?

396
00:33:47,751 --> 00:33:49,651
Yes.

397
00:33:49,753 --> 00:33:52,221
<i>[ Andrew ]
Would you explain that, please?</i>

398
00:33:52,323 --> 00:33:56,657
<i>[ Blake ] Well, the
the whole thing is so confused that, uh</i>

399
00:33:56,760 --> 00:34:00,719
I do remember that I told him
to let go of my son...

400
00:34:00,831 --> 00:34:03,823
and II ordered him out, and...

401
00:34:03,934 --> 00:34:06,698
I saw Mr. Dinard
coming at me, and

402
00:34:06,804 --> 00:34:12,037
And did you try to protect yourself from
this younger and stronger man coming at you?

403
00:34:12,142 --> 00:34:15,737
I don't know. III may have.
I may very well have.

404
00:34:15,846 --> 00:34:20,874
But the whole moment was a moment of an
It was a moment of confusion for me.

405
00:34:21,986 --> 00:34:24,045
I see.

406
00:34:24,154 --> 00:34:26,782
<i>[ Spectators Gasp ]
Is that the way it happened?</i>

407
00:34:26,891 --> 00:34:30,452
<i>You brought your hands up
only to defend yourself.</i>

408
00:34:32,096 --> 00:34:34,064
Yes. Yes, that's exactly
the way it happened.

409
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:39,692
Now, Mr. Carrington,
would you please tell this court...

410
00:34:39,803 --> 00:34:44,240
at that moment,
did you wish Ted Dinard dead?

411
00:34:47,144 --> 00:34:49,112
[ Quietly ]
No. No, I did not.

412
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:59,489
<i>[ Andrew ] Mr. Carrington,
you have said that you love your son.</i>

413
00:35:01,091 --> 00:35:04,458
<i>There are those who will imply
that you do not.</i>

414
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:11,366
Now, Mr. Carrington,
would you try to find it within yourself...

415
00:35:11,468 --> 00:35:17,065
to reveal to us
what a father feels at a time like that

416
00:35:17,174 --> 00:35:19,768
when you entered
your son's room?

417
00:35:24,148 --> 00:35:26,582
Well, may I say this:

418
00:35:26,684 --> 00:35:31,951
That night,
when I walked into Steven's room...

419
00:35:32,056 --> 00:35:35,492
for a moment
an instant really I...

420
00:35:35,592 --> 00:35:39,084
only remember seeing the room

421
00:35:39,196 --> 00:35:42,063
just the room itself.

422
00:35:44,101 --> 00:35:49,004
It was the room...
some 20odd years before...

423
00:35:49,106 --> 00:35:54,009
that my son
when my son was born...

424
00:35:54,111 --> 00:35:58,138
I carried him in
for the first time, into that room.

425
00:35:59,350 --> 00:36:05,289
And II placed him
in his crib in that room.

426
00:36:06,824 --> 00:36:10,658
I spent the night there,
watching my newborn son.

427
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:17,691
<i>In later years, that room
became crowded with memories.</i>

428
00:36:17,801 --> 00:36:23,296
<i>Uh, it... also became crowded
with toys that I bought Steven.</i>

429
00:36:24,441 --> 00:36:27,535
It was a room
where we talked together...

430
00:36:27,644 --> 00:36:33,583
where we wrestled together, where...
I helped my son with his homework.

431
00:36:36,653 --> 00:36:39,178
It was also a room
where I once sat vigil...

432
00:36:39,289 --> 00:36:44,420
when my son almost died
at age five from pneumonia.

433
00:36:47,831 --> 00:36:49,799
It was a room...

434
00:36:52,002 --> 00:36:56,405
in a house I was going
to give my son one day...

435
00:36:57,508 --> 00:37:01,911
<i>in... which I had dreamed...</i>

436
00:37:02,012 --> 00:37:05,573
<i>that my son's son would grow up...</i>

437
00:37:07,718 --> 00:37:12,519
and and hhis son after that.

438
00:37:45,355 --> 00:37:48,051
Thank you, Mr. Carrington.

439
00:37:49,827 --> 00:37:52,261
I have no further questions,
Your Honor.

440
00:37:55,065 --> 00:37:57,465
<i>[ Quinlan ]
Mr. Dunham?</i>

441
00:38:00,170 --> 00:38:03,833
Perhaps Mr. Carrington would like
a brief recess before crossexamination?

442
00:38:03,941 --> 00:38:08,901
No. No.
Thank you very much. I'm fine.

443
00:38:15,786 --> 00:38:19,278
Mom, are you gonna
tell me what's wrong?

444
00:38:19,389 --> 00:38:21,789
Later, baby. Later.

445
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:25,954
Well, I don't wanna go anyplace...

446
00:38:26,063 --> 00:38:29,089
to leave my school, my friends.
Please, Lindsay...

447
00:38:29,199 --> 00:38:31,167
just know that I'm doing
the right thing.

448
00:38:31,268 --> 00:38:33,168
Just know that, all right?

449
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:38,074
<i>[ Quinlan ]
You may continue.</i>

450
00:38:40,344 --> 00:38:42,312
<i>[ Dunham ]
Mr. Carrington...</i>

451
00:38:42,412 --> 00:38:46,371
<i>well,you'vejust told the court
in a very moving speech...</i>

452
00:38:46,483 --> 00:38:49,350
<i>that you love your son very much.</i>

453
00:38:49,453 --> 00:38:53,583
I wonder, sir, have you talked
to Ted Dinard's parents since his death?

454
00:38:53,690 --> 00:38:57,126
<i>[ Blake ] No, I haven't.
Well, that's a pity.</i>

455
00:38:57,227 --> 00:39:00,754
Then they haven't had a chance to tell you
whether or not they find their son's room...

456
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:02,798
a very special place right now

457
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:04,959
a very empty room,
of course, Mr. Carrington.

458
00:39:05,068 --> 00:39:09,232
<i>A room that'll be empty
Objection, Your Honor. Immaterial and irrelevant.</i>

459
00:39:12,676 --> 00:39:17,045
Sustained. Mr. Dunham,
please stick to the facts of this case.

460
00:39:17,147 --> 00:39:19,707
Immaterial and irrelevant.

461
00:39:26,857 --> 00:39:30,293
Mr. Carrington,
in your testimony just now...

462
00:39:30,394 --> 00:39:35,354
you admitted that you might
have uttered the phrase, ""I'll kill him.''

463
00:39:35,465 --> 00:39:38,923
I'm referring, of course, to the night
of November 1 2,just before you...

464
00:39:39,036 --> 00:39:42,563
climbed the stairs to your son's room.

465
00:39:42,673 --> 00:39:47,133
Now I have estimated that
from your position in the vestibule area...

466
00:39:47,244 --> 00:39:51,305
where you said
whatever it was you actually said...

467
00:39:51,415 --> 00:39:54,407
you had to walk about 40 steps...

468
00:39:54,518 --> 00:39:58,454
<i>[ Continues, Narrating ]
to reach the staircase...</i>

469
00:39:58,555 --> 00:40:02,389
<i>then climb 25 steps
up that staircase...</i>

470
00:40:02,492 --> 00:40:07,725
<i>then walk another 1 5 steps
in order to reach your son's room.</i>

471
00:40:08,799 --> 00:40:12,565
That's a long walk.
Yes, it is.

472
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:15,865
Tell us, if you can, Mr. Carrington.

473
00:40:15,973 --> 00:40:19,465
What exactly were your thoughts
as you took all of those steps?

474
00:40:21,144 --> 00:40:25,080
As I explained, I was very angry.

475
00:40:25,182 --> 00:40:27,377
I wanted that young man
out of my house.

476
00:40:27,484 --> 00:40:29,384
<i>But it is your testimony,
Mr. Carrington...</i>

477
00:40:29,486 --> 00:40:32,114
that despite the threat, ""I'll kill him...''

478
00:40:32,222 --> 00:40:34,190
that you might have uttered
just a few seconds before

479
00:40:34,291 --> 00:40:36,725
despite your hatred
for the deceased

480
00:40:36,827 --> 00:40:41,628
at no time during that long and angry walk
did it ever enter your thoughts...

481
00:40:41,732 --> 00:40:44,758
that you would now kill Ted Dinard
in order to be finally rid of him?

482
00:40:44,868 --> 00:40:47,428
<i>No. Those were not my thoughts.
Well, whatever your thoughts...</i>

483
00:40:47,537 --> 00:40:50,995
actually were, Mr. Carrington,
a few minutes later, Ted Dinard was dead.

484
00:40:51,108 --> 00:40:55,169
Isn't that correct?
Yes. Yes, he was. But it was an accident.

485
00:40:55,279 --> 00:40:57,247
<i>You see
No. Please, answer the question,yes or no.</i>

486
00:40:57,347 --> 00:41:01,010
Was he dead?
Yes.

487
00:41:05,055 --> 00:41:08,456
Now, despite your alleged
your alleged confusion...

488
00:41:08,558 --> 00:41:13,689
over how
this alleged accident came to pass...

489
00:41:13,797 --> 00:41:17,927
can you recall, Mr. Carrington, seeing
the two menyour son and the deceased

490
00:41:18,035 --> 00:41:21,163
when you first entered the room?
Yes. I can.

491
00:41:21,271 --> 00:41:23,762
Were they in bed together?
No.

492
00:41:23,874 --> 00:41:26,809
Were they dressed at the time?
Yes.

493
00:41:26,910 --> 00:41:30,846
Well, what in fact were they doing
that so inflamed your sensibilities, sir?

494
00:41:30,947 --> 00:41:34,280
<i>[ Blake ] I told you earlier that
they were standing there.</i>

495
00:41:34,384 --> 00:41:36,477
<i>Mr. Dinard was
embracing my son.</i>

496
00:41:36,586 --> 00:41:40,113
<i>Well, wasn't your son embracing him back?
Wasn't this a mutual farewell?</i>

497
00:41:40,223 --> 00:41:42,953
I don't remember.
You don't remember.

498
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:46,154
What do you remember, Mr. Carrington?
Do you remember thinking that your son

499
00:41:46,263 --> 00:41:49,926
who by his own admission was living openly
as a homosexual with this young man

500
00:41:50,033 --> 00:41:52,729
<i>was now somehow
being seduced by him?</i>

501
00:41:52,836 --> 00:41:58,206
<i>I object, Your Honor. This area has already
been covered by my direct examination.</i>

502
00:41:58,308 --> 00:42:02,074
I don't feel that my client
should have to go through this pain again!

503
00:42:02,179 --> 00:42:05,080
I'm going to have to
overrule you, Mr. Laird.

504
00:42:05,182 --> 00:42:08,242
Answer the question, please.
Yes.

505
00:42:08,352 --> 00:42:11,185
<i>I felt he was seducing my son.</i>

506
00:42:16,093 --> 00:42:19,187
[ Clears Throat ] Mr. Carrington,
are you familiar with the word ""homophobia''?

507
00:42:20,297 --> 00:42:22,197
<i>[ Blake ]
Yes.</i>

508
00:42:22,299 --> 00:42:25,097
<i>[ Dunham ]
Can you give this court a definition?</i>

509
00:42:25,202 --> 00:42:30,071
I believe it means it
it means dislike of homosexuals.

510
00:42:30,173 --> 00:42:34,041
<i>[ Chuckles ] It means a little bit more
than that. I'll help you out.</i>

511
00:42:34,144 --> 00:42:37,671
It's a pathological hatred
of homosexuals...

512
00:42:38,782 --> 00:42:40,750
of gays.

513
00:42:41,852 --> 00:42:43,945
Aren't you in fact a homophobe?

514
00:42:44,054 --> 00:42:46,147
No.

515
00:42:46,256 --> 00:42:49,953
It was only in relation to
my son that I felt any antagon
Homophobic.!

516
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:51,960
<i>[ Shouting ] Homophobic enough to kill?
No!</i>

517
00:42:52,062 --> 00:42:56,089
Mr. Carrington, we have had direct,
conflicting testimony in this trial...

518
00:42:56,199 --> 00:42:58,394
from your own children

519
00:42:58,502 --> 00:43:01,369
<i>from your son
and your daughter</i>

520
00:43:01,471 --> 00:43:04,406
<i>and we've had
very oblique testimony from you, sir.</i>

521
00:43:04,508 --> 00:43:09,468
So there is no absolutely true way that we can
recreate that instant before Ted Dinard died.

522
00:43:09,579 --> 00:43:13,140
But I ask you. I ask you, sir despite what
you have told this court and this jury

523
00:43:13,250 --> 00:43:16,583
isn't it true, sir, that in that last instant
before his death, you wanted to see him dead

524
00:43:16,686 --> 00:43:19,416
<i>you in fact wanted
to kill Ted Dinard</i>

525
00:43:19,523 --> 00:43:23,755
<i>that you took full advantage when you pushed
that young manas your son has testified</i>

526
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:26,124
as your own son has told
this court and jury

527
00:43:26,229 --> 00:43:32,168
to shove him just as violently as you could,
to see him hit his head and to watch him die?

528
00:43:32,269 --> 00:43:35,830
Isn't that what you really wanted?
Isn't that what you really intended, sir?

529
00:43:35,939 --> 00:43:38,767
No! No, that's not true!

530
00:43:52,722 --> 00:43:55,490
I have no further questions.

531
00:43:57,427 --> 00:44:01,625
<i>[ Quinlan ] Mr. Laird, redirect?
No, Your Honor.</i>

532
00:44:01,731 --> 00:44:04,199
The witness is excused.

533
00:44:18,882 --> 00:44:21,482
<i>Does the defense rest?</i>

534
00:44:22,853 --> 00:44:24,946
We rest, Your Honor.

535
00:44:25,055 --> 00:44:29,458
Mr. Dunham, does the state
have any rebuttal witnesses?

536
00:44:29,559 --> 00:44:35,895
Your Honor, the state does have one rebuttal
witness who should be here in a few minutes' time.

537
00:44:45,008 --> 00:44:48,341
And this should blow 'em
right out of the water.

538
00:45:02,526 --> 00:45:06,223
Well, can't we at least stop off
at the office and talk to Daddy first?

539
00:45:06,329 --> 00:45:08,229
Can't we at least do that?

540
00:45:08,331 --> 00:45:12,028
We'll call him later. I promise you, Lindsay.
We'll phone him later.

541
00:45:12,635 --> 00:45:15,195
Oh, Mom.!

542
00:45:19,643 --> 00:45:21,905
[ Lindsay ]
Oh, my God!

543
00:45:27,784 --> 00:45:30,252
<i>[ Man ]
Mr. Blaisdel...</i>

544
00:45:34,558 --> 00:45:37,888
your wife,
your daughter...

545
00:45:38,728 --> 00:45:40,628
What about 'em?

546
00:45:40,730 --> 00:45:46,100
There was a car accident.
They're at Hillside Hospital.
Is it serious?

547
00:45:47,837 --> 00:45:50,533
<i>I'm sorry.
Are you gonna let me outta here?</i>

548
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:54,698
<i>You've got to let me outta here.
Sure. Of course.</i>

549
00:46:07,857 --> 00:46:09,757
Mr. Dunham...

550
00:46:11,795 --> 00:46:14,529
<i>we cannot wait all day.</i>

551
00:46:14,831 --> 00:46:17,994
Yes, Your Honor. I'd like to beg
the indulgence of the court.

552
00:46:18,101 --> 00:46:20,069
If we can have
just a few more minutes.

553
00:46:20,170 --> 00:46:22,729
This is a very important witness.

554
00:46:26,776 --> 00:46:29,476
Your Honor,
our witness has arrived.

555
00:46:46,396 --> 00:46:49,421
What's she doing here?
What's going on?

556
00:46:50,032 --> 00:46:53,265
Oh, my God.
That's my mother.
