1
00:00:00,019 --> 00:00:01,051
<i>Previously on</i> Dynasty...

2
00:00:01,054 --> 00:00:03,619
That is no way to talk to your new boss.

3
00:00:03,621 --> 00:00:05,254
He offered me the COO position.

4
00:00:05,256 --> 00:00:07,457
<i>With Jeff's backing,
I will be chief executive officer</i>

5
00:00:07,459 --> 00:00:09,325
of Carrington Windbriar.

6
00:00:09,327 --> 00:00:10,793
Your new competition.

7
00:00:10,795 --> 00:00:12,695
Matthew coming by today,
was that some sort of test?

8
00:00:12,697 --> 00:00:14,530
<i>Someone spotted you two last night.</i>

9
00:00:14,532 --> 00:00:16,432
<i>There was a
malfunction with the thumper truck.</i>

10
00:00:16,434 --> 00:00:18,000
<i>What if the issue is murder?</i>

11
00:00:18,002 --> 00:00:19,735
You trying to honor the dead
or yourself, Blake?

12
00:00:19,737 --> 00:00:21,971
Wife, mistress...

13
00:00:21,973 --> 00:00:24,474
<i>Widow? Or will you leave
Claudia that scrap?</i>

14
00:00:24,476 --> 00:00:25,641
You have the right to remain silent.

15
00:00:25,643 --> 00:00:26,876
<i>He's accusing you of murder.</i>

16
00:00:26,878 --> 00:00:28,945
I had nothing to do
with Matthew's death.

17
00:00:28,947 --> 00:00:30,580
I can't go and tell
him that my entire past

18
00:00:30,582 --> 00:00:31,714
<i>is one big lie.</i>

19
00:00:31,716 --> 00:00:32,782
<i>Who would do this to you?</i>

20
00:00:32,784 --> 00:00:34,951
Hey!

21
00:00:34,953 --> 00:00:37,320
<i>- You're cool. I got the money.
- What'd you do?</i>

22
00:00:37,322 --> 00:00:38,955
Who do you think set up
tonight's little robbery?

23
00:00:38,957 --> 00:00:40,957
<i>It's missing.
If what's on that phone gets out,</i>

24
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:43,793
it will ruin the Carrington name.

25
00:00:51,469 --> 00:00:52,735
Come on, let's go!

26
00:01:00,512 --> 00:01:01,777
Did you break a nail back there?
Let's go, Steven!

27
00:01:01,779 --> 00:01:03,012
Hyah! Hyah!

28
00:01:08,386 --> 00:01:10,101
You're off your game, Steven.

29
00:01:10,705 --> 00:01:12,688
Murder charge will do that to you.

30
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:14,690
Well, this is supposed to cheer you up.

31
00:01:14,692 --> 00:01:16,859
The only thing my brother
should ever be accused of

32
00:01:16,861 --> 00:01:18,828
is his poor taste in men.

33
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:20,863
Maybe you should screw
one of Dad's lawyers.

34
00:01:20,865 --> 00:01:23,533
Pretty sure they're screwing us
with their astronomical fees.

35
00:01:23,535 --> 00:01:25,902
Well, if they can get you off...

36
00:01:25,904 --> 00:01:27,770
Innuendo unintended.

37
00:01:27,772 --> 00:01:29,071
Without an airtight alibi

38
00:01:29,073 --> 00:01:30,439
to prove that I didn't kill Matthew,

39
00:01:30,441 --> 00:01:32,041
the FBI are saying we
need to provide them

40
00:01:32,043 --> 00:01:33,476
with a credible alternative suspect.

41
00:01:33,478 --> 00:01:34,577
I'm not just gonna let them

42
00:01:34,579 --> 00:01:35,845
throw someone else under the bus.

43
00:01:35,847 --> 00:01:37,547
Well, why not? Daddy would.

44
00:01:37,549 --> 00:01:39,582
As juvenile as it sounds,
I wish Mom were here.

45
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:40,750
Why?

46
00:01:40,752 --> 00:01:42,185
The only thing she's good for

47
00:01:42,187 --> 00:01:44,387
is the occasional birthday
card that her secretary writes.

48
00:01:44,389 --> 00:01:46,122
She spelled your name wrong last time.

49
00:01:46,124 --> 00:01:48,057
Lots of people think it's "ph."

50
00:01:48,059 --> 00:01:49,926
I just wish I could ask her advice.

51
00:01:49,928 --> 00:01:52,295
Hey, the best thing Mom ever taught us

52
00:01:52,297 --> 00:01:54,530
is what we learned when she left:

53
00:01:54,532 --> 00:01:57,300
you can only rely on yourself.

54
00:01:57,302 --> 00:01:58,534
And me.

55
00:02:04,776 --> 00:02:07,310
Timing's a bit obvious, don't you think?

56
00:02:07,312 --> 00:02:11,180
Getting out of Dodge the day
after the house was robbed.

57
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:15,418
Don't forget to pack the silver.

58
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:18,221
Thanks for the bags, Anders.

59
00:02:20,625 --> 00:02:22,525
Where are you going?

60
00:02:22,527 --> 00:02:23,826
Away.

61
00:02:24,807 --> 00:02:26,429
Done with the Carringtons so soon?

62
00:02:26,431 --> 00:02:29,098
I'm just about done with you, Sam.

63
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,666
I'm not exactly over the fact

64
00:02:30,668 --> 00:02:32,935
that you staged a robbery in my home.

65
00:02:32,937 --> 00:02:34,904
It'll be fine. My mom's got her money,

66
00:02:34,906 --> 00:02:37,173
and you can get a less tacky ring,

67
00:02:37,175 --> 00:02:39,742
something that doesn't
belong in a gumball machine.

68
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:42,178
Right now,
Blake is meeting with Stansfield.

69
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,447
If the cops find out
that it was your friends,

70
00:02:44,449 --> 00:02:47,116
that you were involved,
that I'm lying to my husband...

71
00:02:47,118 --> 00:02:48,651
Add it to the list.

72
00:02:48,653 --> 00:02:49,486
This is different.

73
00:02:49,521 --> 00:02:52,221
You pick and choose your
lies like you do your men.

74
00:02:52,223 --> 00:02:54,056
Okay, enough.

75
00:02:54,058 --> 00:02:56,292
All I've done is jump from
one crisis to the next.

76
00:02:56,294 --> 00:02:58,294
Matthew, a murder investigation,

77
00:02:58,296 --> 00:02:59,996
now my nephew's felony.

78
00:02:59,998 --> 00:03:01,731
It's no way to start a marriage.

79
00:03:01,733 --> 00:03:02,658
So you're running away?

80
00:03:02,701 --> 00:03:04,400
I'm going on my honeymoon.

81
00:03:04,402 --> 00:03:07,803
Wow. Why pack anything at all?

82
00:03:07,805 --> 00:03:09,438
Yeah, put that away.

83
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,574
I don't need to see how
Blake's sausage is made.

84
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:13,876
Fine. Go.

85
00:03:13,878 --> 00:03:16,245
And this whole thing will
blow over before you get back.

86
00:03:16,247 --> 00:03:18,281
For your sake, I hope so.

87
00:03:18,283 --> 00:03:21,550
And Anders is sniffing around,
so you need to lay low.

88
00:03:21,552 --> 00:03:23,786
I always do.

89
00:03:23,788 --> 00:03:26,122
If the diamond was registered,
we have some hope of tracing it.

90
00:03:26,124 --> 00:03:28,724
Forget about the ring.
That's what insurance is for.

91
00:03:28,726 --> 00:03:30,226
I need that phone back.

92
00:03:30,228 --> 00:03:33,562
If anybody finds out that I had it,
or what's on it,

93
00:03:33,564 --> 00:03:35,298
the FBI's gonna be all over me.

94
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,233
At the moment,
they're busy investigating your son.

95
00:03:37,235 --> 00:03:38,768
Who thinks that I gave it back to you.

96
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:39,480
You told him.

97
00:03:39,538 --> 00:03:42,138
Well, he knew something was going on.

98
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:45,241
And if he finds out I lied...

99
00:03:45,243 --> 00:03:47,543
I'm not the only one with
something to lose here.

100
00:03:47,545 --> 00:03:49,178
If anybody else finds out

101
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:50,880
that I had that phone, they're gonna ask

102
00:03:50,882 --> 00:03:52,048
where I got it from.

103
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:54,016
If they find out that you
stole it from evidence...

104
00:03:54,018 --> 00:03:56,452
The entire robbery division is on this,

105
00:03:56,454 --> 00:03:58,020
working around the clock.

106
00:03:58,022 --> 00:03:59,422
I don't care what you have to do.

107
00:03:59,424 --> 00:04:01,324
You find the people that took that phone

108
00:04:01,326 --> 00:04:03,025
before they realize what they have.

109
00:04:03,027 --> 00:04:05,194
Not just for my sake or yours.

110
00:04:06,931 --> 00:04:08,631
My family's, too.

111
00:04:13,217 --> 00:04:14,503
Can I help you?

112
00:04:14,505 --> 00:04:16,472
Just looking for the bathroom.

113
00:04:16,474 --> 00:04:18,507
It's easy to get lost in this place.

114
00:04:18,509 --> 00:04:21,377
Not easy enough.

115
00:04:22,045 --> 00:04:22,745
<i>Sorry I'm late.</i>

116
00:04:22,747 --> 00:04:25,147
I thought I'd squeeze in
a little morning ride.

117
00:04:25,149 --> 00:04:26,814
Mm. Anyone I know?

118
00:04:27,518 --> 00:04:29,685
A handsome warm-blood
palomino named Butterscotch.

119
00:04:29,687 --> 00:04:32,755
He was a gift for my
16th birthday from Daddy.

120
00:04:32,757 --> 00:04:35,991
Speaking of, what happened to
the dirt you were looking for?

121
00:04:35,993 --> 00:04:37,660
Nothing from the driver?

122
00:04:37,662 --> 00:04:39,729
Don't worry about the lawsuit.

123
00:04:39,731 --> 00:04:41,197
Your dad's gonna drop it?

124
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:43,399
No. We are.

125
00:04:43,401 --> 00:04:44,967
We don't need the Carrington name.

126
00:04:44,969 --> 00:04:46,969
This company represents
a new start for me.

127
00:04:46,971 --> 00:04:47,970
We need a new name.

128
00:04:47,972 --> 00:04:49,405
My name.

129
00:04:49,407 --> 00:04:51,407
So what? Like Fallon Co.?

130
00:04:51,812 --> 00:04:54,076
This isn't amateur hour.

131
00:04:55,493 --> 00:04:57,847
Morell Green Energy Corporation?

132
00:04:57,849 --> 00:04:59,115
My middle name.

133
00:04:59,117 --> 00:05:01,617
A reminder that I can
only count on myself.

134
00:05:01,619 --> 00:05:03,252
What about the guy backing you?

135
00:05:03,254 --> 00:05:04,687
As you said, you're backing me.

136
00:05:04,689 --> 00:05:06,989
I'm the one who needs to
prove my value in this market,

137
00:05:06,991 --> 00:05:08,491
and I know how.

138
00:05:08,493 --> 00:05:10,826
The city utility contract
is up for renewal this year.

139
00:05:10,828 --> 00:05:12,044
It's worth a billion at least.

140
00:05:12,097 --> 00:05:14,296
You want to poach the city of Atlanta?

141
00:05:14,298 --> 00:05:17,199
Hasn't C.A. had that contract for,
like, 60 years?

142
00:05:17,201 --> 00:05:18,634
Well, imagine the headline:

143
00:05:18,636 --> 00:05:20,870
"The home of Carrington Atlantic
powered by Morell Corp."

144
00:05:20,872 --> 00:05:22,037
That's ambitious.

145
00:05:22,039 --> 00:05:23,806
You don't hit a home
run without a big swing.

146
00:05:23,808 --> 00:05:25,241
This would put us on the map.

147
00:05:25,243 --> 00:05:26,942
It would show people that clean energy

148
00:05:26,944 --> 00:05:28,310
could scale up in a big way.

149
00:05:28,312 --> 00:05:30,079
And screw over your dad.

150
00:05:30,241 --> 00:05:31,714
It's a win-win.

151
00:05:31,716 --> 00:05:33,549
His new COO can pick up the pieces.

152
00:05:33,551 --> 00:05:36,285
So how exactly are we
gonna pull this off?

153
00:05:36,287 --> 00:05:38,053
Oh, not "we," me.

154
00:05:38,055 --> 00:05:39,989
Chris Pfeiffer runs
point on these things

155
00:05:39,991 --> 00:05:41,605
over at the city council,
and he and I go back

156
00:05:41,693 --> 00:05:43,292
to my C.A. days. He loves me.

157
00:05:43,294 --> 00:05:45,594
Enough to cross Blake Carrington?

158
00:05:45,596 --> 00:05:47,329
Oh, please.
He would leave his wife for me.

159
00:05:47,331 --> 00:05:48,664
And his side piece.

160
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:50,199
Not that I'm offering. I'm just saying.

161
00:05:50,201 --> 00:05:52,601
It won't take much to get
him eating out of my hand.

162
00:05:55,726 --> 00:05:56,839
Hey, sweetheart.

163
00:05:56,841 --> 00:05:59,108
Anders said you wanted to see me.

164
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:00,409
What's going on?

165
00:06:00,411 --> 00:06:03,512
With everything that happened,
we missed Bora Bora.

166
00:06:03,514 --> 00:06:05,481
So, plan B.

167
00:06:05,483 --> 00:06:07,216
I've taken care of the arrangements,

168
00:06:07,218 --> 00:06:08,851
packed you a suitcase.

169
00:06:08,853 --> 00:06:11,120
I'm even handling the transportation.

170
00:06:11,122 --> 00:06:12,755
Where are we going?

171
00:06:12,757 --> 00:06:13,956
It's a surprise.

172
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:16,425
But I can give you a
preview of the itinerary.

173
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:18,794
Oh.

174
00:06:20,765 --> 00:06:24,133
Just so much going on here.

175
00:06:24,135 --> 00:06:28,170
Steven's charges and now the robbery.

176
00:06:28,172 --> 00:06:30,306
It's just not the best time to go away.

177
00:06:30,308 --> 00:06:32,341
And after this weekend,
we go back to work.

178
00:06:32,343 --> 00:06:34,210
If we don't go away now,

179
00:06:34,212 --> 00:06:36,679
we will be celebrating
our first anniversary

180
00:06:36,681 --> 00:06:38,914
before we take our honeymoon.

181
00:06:38,916 --> 00:06:40,816
I don't know.

182
00:06:40,818 --> 00:06:41,917
You're not Steven's lawyer.

183
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,385
You've told Stansfield
everything you can

184
00:06:43,387 --> 00:06:46,088
about the robbery,
and we'll only be a phone call away.

185
00:06:47,823 --> 00:06:49,492
You make a very firm point.

186
00:06:49,494 --> 00:06:51,360
Mm-hmm.

187
00:06:51,362 --> 00:06:52,895
So when you robbed the place,

188
00:06:52,897 --> 00:06:54,730
did you find some kind of cell phone?

189
00:06:55,838 --> 00:06:57,800
You know, I was wondering
when you'd come for it.

190
00:06:57,802 --> 00:06:59,001
- So you have it.
- Yeah.

191
00:06:59,003 --> 00:07:00,836
It was in one of the
drawers in the bedroom.

192
00:07:00,838 --> 00:07:02,338
I was just grabbing things.

193
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:04,473
Figured we'd look through
it when it was time to sell.

194
00:07:04,475 --> 00:07:06,141
Wait. You didn't sell it, did you?

195
00:07:06,143 --> 00:07:07,910
Not yet.

196
00:07:08,495 --> 00:07:10,479
Relax, man. I'm gonna cut you in.

197
00:07:11,023 --> 00:07:13,413
No, man, I don't need a cut.
I need the phone.

198
00:07:13,418 --> 00:07:15,518
They're looking for it and for you,

199
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,020
and I think they'll stop
if they have it back.

200
00:07:18,022 --> 00:07:19,221
I'll give you cash.

201
00:07:19,223 --> 00:07:21,023
Can't be worth more
than a couple hundred.

202
00:07:21,025 --> 00:07:23,392
You mean a couple hundred grand, right?

203
00:07:23,394 --> 00:07:24,693
I saw the video, man.

204
00:07:24,695 --> 00:07:25,928
And since it is your aunt,

205
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:27,796
I'll even give you a little bit extra.

206
00:07:27,798 --> 00:07:29,665
What video?

207
00:07:30,735 --> 00:07:32,935
The one with your aunt and the dead guy.

208
00:07:33,405 --> 00:07:36,305
Let's just say I didn't realize
they knew each other that well.

209
00:07:36,307 --> 00:07:37,706
Or that she was so hot.

210
00:07:38,808 --> 00:07:40,809
A sex tape?

211
00:07:40,811 --> 00:07:42,278
You can't sell that.

212
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,679
Are you kidding me?

213
00:07:43,681 --> 00:07:45,681
That's Kardashian-level
filmmaking right there.

214
00:07:45,683 --> 00:07:47,466
We're gonna have a bidding war for it.

215
00:07:48,006 --> 00:07:51,387
Unless the Carringtons want
to pay fair market value.

216
00:07:51,389 --> 00:07:53,889
I just got you a huge payday.
Now you're getting greedy.

217
00:07:53,891 --> 00:07:55,291
I mean, that's easy to say
when you're living

218
00:07:55,293 --> 00:07:56,859
in their mansion, isn't it?

219
00:07:57,966 --> 00:07:58,894
Give me the phone.

220
00:07:58,896 --> 00:08:00,596
Get my money by 5:00.

221
00:08:21,845 --> 00:08:23,375
There you are.

222
00:08:23,472 --> 00:08:25,123
Been trying Cristal,
but she's not picking up.

223
00:08:25,212 --> 00:08:26,489
Whoa, slow down. What happened?

224
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:29,747
Remember when I told you I
have some sketchy friends?

225
00:08:29,749 --> 00:08:32,016
Stupid kid stuff, I think you said.

226
00:08:32,018 --> 00:08:34,618
Yeah. Well, it was one
of those stupid kids

227
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,620
who bling-ringed your
house the other night.

228
00:08:36,622 --> 00:08:39,690
- What? Did you know?
- No.

229
00:08:39,692 --> 00:08:41,158
I mean, I told him about the gala,

230
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:43,260
but I thought he was just
coming for the free food.

231
00:08:43,262 --> 00:08:44,795
Huh. And the free jewelry.

232
00:08:44,797 --> 00:08:46,197
Sounds like a great friend.

233
00:08:46,199 --> 00:08:47,565
I'll call Stansfield.

234
00:08:47,567 --> 00:08:49,333
No, no. Listen.

235
00:08:49,335 --> 00:08:50,835
It wasn't just jewelry.

236
00:08:50,837 --> 00:08:53,004
There was a phone in your dad's room...

237
00:08:53,006 --> 00:08:54,071
Matthew's phone,

238
00:08:54,073 --> 00:08:56,774
with a video of him and my aunt.

239
00:08:56,776 --> 00:08:58,776
He told me he gave that phone back.

240
00:08:58,778 --> 00:09:01,178
We need to come up with
$200,000 in the next few hours,

241
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:02,613
or my aunt's sex tape

242
00:09:02,615 --> 00:09:04,094
will be all over the Internet.

243
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:06,050
Cristal didn't do anything,
and she's the one

244
00:09:06,052 --> 00:09:07,518
who's gonna get hurt here.

245
00:09:09,355 --> 00:09:11,455
You have reached the cell phone

246
00:09:11,457 --> 00:09:12,790
of Blake Carrington. Press one...

247
00:09:12,792 --> 00:09:14,625
I don't even know where my dad is.

248
00:09:14,627 --> 00:09:18,362
Well... what would he do?

249
00:09:22,439 --> 00:09:23,768
The hunting cabin.

250
00:09:25,104 --> 00:09:28,105
Can't believe you chose this place.

251
00:09:29,308 --> 00:09:31,609
Of all the Carrington properties,

252
00:09:31,611 --> 00:09:33,911
this seemed the most low-key.

253
00:09:33,913 --> 00:09:35,779
I'm surprised you didn't
figure it out sooner.

254
00:09:35,781 --> 00:09:38,149
Oh, I've always come in by helicopter.

255
00:09:38,151 --> 00:09:39,583
Well, just so you know,

256
00:09:39,585 --> 00:09:41,886
we won't be killing any
animals on this trip.

257
00:09:41,888 --> 00:09:44,755
But I thought it would be
nice to get out of the city.

258
00:09:44,757 --> 00:09:48,259
Just you and me and these trees.

259
00:09:48,261 --> 00:09:50,361
Yeah, not one of them a cell tower.

260
00:09:50,363 --> 00:09:52,930
If you're good,
I might let you get on the Wi-Fi.

261
00:09:53,571 --> 00:09:54,832
There is no Wi-Fi.

262
00:09:54,834 --> 00:09:57,234
My grandfather built this
place to get away from it all.

263
00:09:57,236 --> 00:09:58,836
We never put in Internet.

264
00:09:58,838 --> 00:10:01,405
Even better! More time for us.

265
00:10:01,407 --> 00:10:03,007
Mm.

266
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:12,616
No wonder people choose
the private sector.

267
00:10:12,618 --> 00:10:13,620
Fallon?

268
00:10:14,487 --> 00:10:16,220
Thank God. There's no receptionist.

269
00:10:16,222 --> 00:10:18,089
Kori Rucks.
I work with Councilman Pfeiffer.

270
00:10:18,091 --> 00:10:19,990
You wouldn't happen to have a
real cup of coffee, would you?

271
00:10:22,244 --> 00:10:24,228
Oh. That's a little too real.

272
00:10:25,204 --> 00:10:26,931
I'm sorry, I don't work for Chris.

273
00:10:26,933 --> 00:10:28,716
I'm on the council... district ten.

274
00:10:28,751 --> 00:10:29,466
I'm told that you're here

275
00:10:29,468 --> 00:10:31,635
- to discuss the utility contracts.
- Yes.

276
00:10:31,637 --> 00:10:33,838
I know that Councilman Pfeiffer
is in charge of all that, so...

277
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,306
Actually, I'm taking over.

278
00:10:35,308 --> 00:10:38,642
So, if you're here to talk energy,
let's talk.

279
00:10:49,088 --> 00:10:50,821
Anders.

280
00:10:50,823 --> 00:10:52,823
Join me for a time trial.

281
00:10:52,825 --> 00:10:54,191
That would require sweat.

282
00:10:55,109 --> 00:10:55,826
Come on, man.

283
00:10:55,828 --> 00:10:57,795
You know Blake is out
of town for the weekend.

284
00:10:57,797 --> 00:11:00,364
You could lose a button or two.
Live a little.

285
00:11:03,069 --> 00:11:05,202
As you know, Mr. Carrington's very upset

286
00:11:05,204 --> 00:11:06,804
- about this robbery.
- Yeah.

287
00:11:06,806 --> 00:11:08,923
I could imagine. That was
a pretty nasty bump on his head.

288
00:11:09,008 --> 00:11:11,542
Finding out who's responsible
is a high priority for him,

289
00:11:11,544 --> 00:11:12,643
as it is for me.

290
00:11:12,645 --> 00:11:15,112
So, if you saw anything,

291
00:11:15,114 --> 00:11:17,448
anything that you thought
might be a bit amiss...

292
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:19,683
Well, like I told the cops,
I wasn't really watching.

293
00:11:19,685 --> 00:11:22,419
I imagine you had your
head in other matters.

294
00:11:22,421 --> 00:11:24,622
Like Ms. Carrington.

295
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,492
I take it she didn't see much, either.

296
00:11:28,494 --> 00:11:30,594
You'll have to ask Ms. Carrington.

297
00:11:30,596 --> 00:11:33,097
Very well.

298
00:11:33,099 --> 00:11:37,134
But if you should think of
something or hear anything,

299
00:11:37,136 --> 00:11:39,503
let me know.

300
00:11:39,505 --> 00:11:41,305
I don't have to remind you

301
00:11:41,307 --> 00:11:42,840
that this incident doesn't reflect well

302
00:11:42,842 --> 00:11:44,542
on those of us who are employed here.

303
00:11:44,544 --> 00:11:45,629
What does that mean?

304
00:11:45,812 --> 00:11:49,213
It's just that we all have a
stake in putting this to bed,

305
00:11:49,215 --> 00:11:51,749
especially those of us
with families that depend

306
00:11:51,751 --> 00:11:53,484
on our salaries.

307
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:58,055
Anything specific I should
be listening out for?

308
00:11:58,057 --> 00:11:59,423
Just the personal effects.

309
00:11:59,425 --> 00:12:02,993
Mrs. Carrington's ring,
some watches, and a phone

310
00:12:02,995 --> 00:12:06,430
of particular value to Mr. Carrington.

311
00:12:06,432 --> 00:12:08,465
All right.
I'll keep my ear to the ground.

312
00:12:09,795 --> 00:12:11,902
And your mouth off Fallon.

313
00:12:15,208 --> 00:12:17,541
Morell Corp represents the
next generation of energy,

314
00:12:17,543 --> 00:12:19,977
and Atlanta has a chance
to become a national model

315
00:12:19,979 --> 00:12:21,078
for a green city.

316
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,379
We plan to take clean power

317
00:12:22,381 --> 00:12:24,081
and spread it up and down the coast,

318
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:25,316
take it national and then beyond.

319
00:12:25,318 --> 00:12:27,451
So Atlanta's just the first step.

320
00:12:27,453 --> 00:12:28,319
Exactly.

321
00:12:28,321 --> 00:12:29,887
Hmm.

322
00:12:31,224 --> 00:12:34,058
I wish you the best of
luck with your new company,

323
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:36,493
but Atlanta is not a means to an end.

324
00:12:36,495 --> 00:12:39,863
This is my home, my city,
and now my responsibility,

325
00:12:39,865 --> 00:12:42,633
not some pawn in the
Carrington family feud.

326
00:12:42,635 --> 00:12:44,134
Well, I understand the connotations

327
00:12:44,136 --> 00:12:45,603
with the Carrington name,
but Morell Corp.

328
00:12:45,605 --> 00:12:47,071
is an entirely different company.

329
00:12:47,073 --> 00:12:49,773
Well, whatever you call it,
you're still you,

330
00:12:49,775 --> 00:12:52,276
and you haven't changed
since high school.

331
00:12:54,109 --> 00:12:55,512
You went to Penley.

332
00:12:55,514 --> 00:12:56,865
Oh, my God.

333
00:12:57,149 --> 00:12:58,716
Of course. Kori.

334
00:12:58,718 --> 00:13:01,185
You look so different.
Did you change your hair?

335
00:13:01,187 --> 00:13:02,353
Come on, Fallon.

336
00:13:03,153 --> 00:13:04,088
You can't expect me

337
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:07,358
to buy this "new year,
new me" bit, can you?

338
00:13:08,967 --> 00:13:10,094
Maybe you can.

339
00:13:10,096 --> 00:13:13,163
You seem to have the whole
world bowing at your feet.

340
00:13:13,835 --> 00:13:16,700
I'm sure you'll be fine without Atlanta.

341
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:21,272
See you at the ten-year reunion.

342
00:13:23,662 --> 00:13:25,709
I didn't know who else to call.

343
00:13:25,711 --> 00:13:27,011
You did the right thing.

344
00:13:27,013 --> 00:13:29,246
This guy is a friend of Sam's.

345
00:13:29,248 --> 00:13:31,815
I don't know if you can
call that a friend, but...

346
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:35,052
he used Sam to get into the house.

347
00:13:35,054 --> 00:13:37,655
And he has the phone
with this video on it?

348
00:13:37,657 --> 00:13:39,957
He's trying to extort my father,
but Dad is M.I.A.,

349
00:13:39,959 --> 00:13:41,292
and we don't have that much time.

350
00:13:41,294 --> 00:13:42,426
How much does this guy want?

351
00:13:42,428 --> 00:13:43,761
$200,000. That's easy.

352
00:13:43,763 --> 00:13:46,664
But what if I get the
phone back and he's already

353
00:13:46,666 --> 00:13:48,232
- copied the video?
- Right.

354
00:13:48,234 --> 00:13:51,769
Why settle for one payday
if you can have two?

355
00:13:51,771 --> 00:13:53,270
And, uh, the nephew?

356
00:13:54,286 --> 00:13:56,140
No, Sam didn't have
anything to do with this.

357
00:13:56,142 --> 00:13:59,043
He's tied up with some bad people.

358
00:13:59,045 --> 00:14:01,312
The best shot at stopping this

359
00:14:01,314 --> 00:14:03,180
is putting cuffs on both of them.

360
00:14:03,182 --> 00:14:05,582
Arresting Blake Carrington's new nephew

361
00:14:05,584 --> 00:14:08,052
would only invite questions.

362
00:14:08,054 --> 00:14:12,256
Questions you don't want,
since you stole the phone first.

363
00:14:12,258 --> 00:14:14,125
From evidence.

364
00:14:14,127 --> 00:14:16,293
Look, I just want all this to be over.

365
00:14:16,295 --> 00:14:19,063
So I'll go in and buy the phone,
you come in and get this guy.

366
00:14:19,826 --> 00:14:22,466
Silver spoon's first sting.

367
00:14:22,468 --> 00:14:24,601
Your dad would be proud.

368
00:14:26,172 --> 00:14:28,539
Let's just call this what it is.

369
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:32,209
This is you cleaning
up your own corruption.

370
00:14:32,211 --> 00:14:33,610
You tampered with a murder investigation

371
00:14:33,612 --> 00:14:35,879
when you should have been
actually figuring out who did it

372
00:14:35,881 --> 00:14:37,715
so that I don't go to prison
for a crime I didn't commit.

373
00:14:37,717 --> 00:14:39,416
What exactly do you want me to do?

374
00:14:39,418 --> 00:14:40,417
Do your job.

375
00:14:40,419 --> 00:14:42,453
Find out who really killed Matthew.

376
00:14:42,455 --> 00:14:43,754
Make it right.

377
00:14:50,685 --> 00:14:52,754
How could you not remember Kori?

378
00:14:52,756 --> 00:14:54,389
Well, I do now.

379
00:14:54,391 --> 00:14:56,992
Didn't she have some weird
Hello Kitty obsession?

380
00:14:56,994 --> 00:14:58,794
You still don't.

381
00:14:58,796 --> 00:15:00,862
Maybe I should have been
your wingman, after all.

382
00:15:00,864 --> 00:15:02,097
I'm glad you find this funny,

383
00:15:02,099 --> 00:15:03,732
but I am not losing this contract, Jeff,

384
00:15:03,734 --> 00:15:05,433
especially not over a few hurt feelings.

385
00:15:05,435 --> 00:15:07,536
You really think it's
just about high school?

386
00:15:07,538 --> 00:15:08,870
Obviously.

387
00:15:08,872 --> 00:15:10,018
Why don't you let me try?

388
00:15:10,363 --> 00:15:12,541
Maybe I can smooth things over.

389
00:15:12,543 --> 00:15:14,676
Remind Kori that you're
not the whole company.

390
00:15:14,678 --> 00:15:15,844
Kori Rucks?

391
00:15:15,846 --> 00:15:17,546
Seriously?

392
00:15:17,548 --> 00:15:18,404
You, too?

393
00:15:18,483 --> 00:15:20,549
Fallon had a meeting with her today.

394
00:15:20,551 --> 00:15:21,626
Didn't know who she was.

395
00:15:21,985 --> 00:15:24,319
I might have also asked her
to get me a cup of coffee.

396
00:15:24,321 --> 00:15:25,139
- What?
- What?

397
00:15:25,189 --> 00:15:26,721
I know. I thought she was an assistant.

398
00:15:26,723 --> 00:15:28,623
- I'm fixing it.
- No, actually, I am.

399
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:30,425
I'm gonna call her.

400
00:15:30,427 --> 00:15:31,560
Good luck with that.

401
00:15:31,562 --> 00:15:33,862
You know Kori does not roll over easily.

402
00:15:33,864 --> 00:15:34,996
Present tense?

403
00:15:34,998 --> 00:15:36,198
- You're still friends?
- Yeah.

404
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,600
We went to MJQ last weekend.
I invited you.

405
00:15:39,402 --> 00:15:41,436
Do you listen to anything I say?

406
00:15:41,438 --> 00:15:42,871
Don't take it personally.

407
00:15:42,873 --> 00:15:45,574
Actually, Monica,
what if you invited her out tonight,

408
00:15:45,576 --> 00:15:47,309
and I just happened to be there?

409
00:15:47,311 --> 00:15:48,602
She might be a bit more receptive.

410
00:15:48,689 --> 00:15:51,847
Well, with all due respect,
I'm the one who knows energy.

411
00:15:51,849 --> 00:15:53,782
Yeah, let me butter her up, okay?

412
00:15:53,784 --> 00:15:55,826
Set the stage, then you come in.

413
00:15:55,886 --> 00:15:57,586
And do all the heavy lifting.

414
00:15:57,588 --> 00:15:59,221
Not that your part isn't heavy, too.

415
00:16:00,972 --> 00:16:01,990
I got to say,

416
00:16:02,448 --> 00:16:05,460
I do not mind not having an office yet.

417
00:16:05,462 --> 00:16:08,263
We swimming or what?

418
00:16:13,507 --> 00:16:15,274
Looks like the Carringtons came through.

419
00:16:15,276 --> 00:16:17,443
$200,000. It's all here.

420
00:16:17,445 --> 00:16:19,912
Where's the phone?

421
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:23,749
How do I know that's it?

422
00:16:23,751 --> 00:16:25,284
Show me the contacts or something.

423
00:16:28,589 --> 00:16:30,222
Okay, turn it off.

424
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:34,426
You swear this is the only copy?

425
00:16:35,289 --> 00:16:36,776
Even I have a code, okay?

426
00:16:36,811 --> 00:16:37,563
Deal's a deal.

427
00:16:38,241 --> 00:16:39,431
Don't spend it all in one place.

428
00:16:39,433 --> 00:16:40,799
Back at you.

429
00:16:40,801 --> 00:16:42,768
I'm sure Carrington's
errand boy pays pretty well.

430
00:16:43,602 --> 00:16:45,204
You're the one with 200 grand now.

431
00:16:45,834 --> 00:16:47,439
I'm Robin Hood.

432
00:16:48,432 --> 00:16:49,274
Everything okay?

433
00:16:49,686 --> 00:16:51,419
Got it.

434
00:16:51,421 --> 00:16:52,721
And the video?

435
00:16:52,723 --> 00:16:55,223
- He swears it's the only copy.
- Do you believe him?

436
00:16:55,225 --> 00:16:58,260
Look, screwed up as it sounds,
he's not a bad dude.

437
00:16:59,314 --> 00:17:01,062
Why are you freaking out?

438
00:17:01,064 --> 00:17:03,098
I got it. We're good.

439
00:17:04,486 --> 00:17:05,534
Yeah, you can go in.

440
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:09,538
Yeah, I'll get you the phone
after you get my 200 grand back.

441
00:17:10,027 --> 00:17:11,297
Who was that?

442
00:17:11,332 --> 00:17:12,307
Stansfield.

443
00:17:12,309 --> 00:17:13,775
What?

444
00:17:15,479 --> 00:17:17,078
- You didn't say anything about cops.
- Don't worry.

445
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:19,147
<i>I told him you didn't
have anything to do with that.</i>

446
00:17:19,149 --> 00:17:21,583
Hey, if anything,
you were the one that solved it.

447
00:17:22,355 --> 00:17:25,020
Let's get out of here.

448
00:17:26,009 --> 00:17:27,889
Go, go, go!

449
00:17:27,891 --> 00:17:31,326
So, I know I said no dead animals,

450
00:17:31,328 --> 00:17:35,163
but since this one's already here,

451
00:17:35,165 --> 00:17:38,200
I thought I'd slip into something

452
00:17:38,202 --> 00:17:41,436
a little more comfortable.

453
00:17:43,273 --> 00:17:46,141
Blake?

454
00:17:49,156 --> 00:17:50,612
Damn it!

455
00:17:50,614 --> 00:17:52,013
What are you doing?

456
00:17:52,015 --> 00:17:53,181
I missed a call from the office.

457
00:17:53,183 --> 00:17:56,318
My damn phone won't even ring out here.

458
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,611
Can't even call them back.
I can't even get voice mail.

459
00:17:58,622 --> 00:18:01,389
So, I'm standing here naked,
wrapped in an animal

460
00:18:01,391 --> 00:18:03,458
that probably died before I was born,

461
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:04,893
and you're calling the office?

462
00:18:04,895 --> 00:18:06,582
Well, if you'd have told me
we were gonna be off the grid,

463
00:18:06,597 --> 00:18:07,829
I would have planned things differently.

464
00:18:07,831 --> 00:18:10,066
I thought the surprise
would be romantic.

465
00:18:10,354 --> 00:18:13,307
These are the first few days we've
had just to be husband and wife,

466
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:16,104
and they might be the last
ones we have for a while.

467
00:18:16,106 --> 00:18:18,506
Just want to enjoy them.

468
00:18:18,508 --> 00:18:20,475
Don't you?

469
00:18:20,477 --> 00:18:22,677
- Of course, I do.
- Good.

470
00:18:22,679 --> 00:18:25,380
If I remember correctly,
there's a waterfall

471
00:18:25,677 --> 00:18:27,582
a couple of miles from here.

472
00:18:27,584 --> 00:18:30,352
It's not a hot tub,
but you can't beat it for stargazing.

473
00:18:30,354 --> 00:18:32,153
So, if you're up for an adventure...

474
00:18:32,155 --> 00:18:35,590
- Always. I'll go change.
- Hang on.

475
00:18:35,592 --> 00:18:37,726
One minute.

476
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:42,831
Well, can we try for two?

477
00:18:44,016 --> 00:18:44,799
<i>Why didn't you tell me</i>

478
00:18:44,801 --> 00:18:46,034
you had gone to Stansfield?

479
00:18:46,036 --> 00:18:47,669
What kind of a friend
robs your aunt's house,

480
00:18:47,671 --> 00:18:49,337
then tries to blackmail
her with a sex tape?

481
00:18:49,339 --> 00:18:51,039
I'm not saying that
what he did was okay.

482
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:52,874
No, it was technically illegal.

483
00:18:52,876 --> 00:18:53,975
Have you ever broken a law?

484
00:18:55,114 --> 00:18:56,611
I've never extorted anyone.

485
00:18:56,613 --> 00:18:58,213
Because you haven't had to.

486
00:18:58,215 --> 00:19:01,650
You don't know what it is like
to worry about making rent

487
00:19:01,652 --> 00:19:04,085
or what you're gonna do
if your car breaks down.

488
00:19:04,087 --> 00:19:06,488
Are you seriously suggesting
we should've just let him

489
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:07,656
get away with it?

490
00:19:07,658 --> 00:19:08,857
Taken him at his word

491
00:19:08,859 --> 00:19:10,056
that he's gonna stick to the deal?

492
00:19:10,127 --> 00:19:12,460
- He's a-a criminal.
- Why didn't you tell me your plan?

493
00:19:12,462 --> 00:19:14,195
Look, I didn't want
to make you lie in there.

494
00:19:14,197 --> 00:19:15,730
I was trying to protect you.

495
00:19:15,732 --> 00:19:16,965
And who does that sound like?

496
00:19:18,274 --> 00:19:19,768
I thought you were the different one,

497
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:21,903
but now I see the family resemblance.

498
00:19:21,905 --> 00:19:23,171
Mr. Carrington.

499
00:19:25,332 --> 00:19:27,809
- You got two seconds for me?
- I'm already late.

500
00:19:27,811 --> 00:19:29,778
Wait, what does this dress say to you?

501
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:31,212
Bold? Demure?

502
00:19:31,214 --> 00:19:32,614
Loud enough to command a room

503
00:19:32,616 --> 00:19:34,549
yet still whisper
"top of the class at Wharton"?

504
00:19:36,904 --> 00:19:37,619
Is that...?

505
00:19:37,621 --> 00:19:38,586
Matthew's phone.

506
00:19:38,588 --> 00:19:39,888
- What,<i> you</i> took it?
- No.

507
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:41,589
Sam's friend did when
he robbed our house.

508
00:19:41,591 --> 00:19:42,857
It's a long story.

509
00:19:42,859 --> 00:19:44,826
But Dad told me he'd given
this back to Stansfield.

510
00:19:44,828 --> 00:19:46,962
- Hmm. So, how'd you get it back?
- Sam.

511
00:19:46,964 --> 00:19:48,763
And 200 grand.

512
00:19:48,765 --> 00:19:51,366
But you remember the photo of
Cristal and Matthew in the car?

513
00:19:51,716 --> 00:19:52,467
Yeah.

514
00:19:52,469 --> 00:19:56,037
Well, there's a video on here of
them doing way more than sitting.

515
00:19:56,873 --> 00:19:58,006
Have you seen it?

516
00:19:58,008 --> 00:19:59,407
I can't unsee it.

517
00:19:59,409 --> 00:20:01,710
I don't even want to
know why Dad had it.

518
00:20:03,615 --> 00:20:05,688
Oh. Well, at least it's grainy.

519
00:20:05,723 --> 00:20:07,917
Though she almost looks hot upside down.

520
00:20:08,518 --> 00:20:10,018
Well, I got the phone back,

521
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:12,020
and I led Stansfield to the robber.

522
00:20:12,763 --> 00:20:14,356
Wait. You helped Stansfield?

523
00:20:14,358 --> 00:20:17,659
I helped everyone...
Dad, Cristal, Sammy Jo.

524
00:20:17,661 --> 00:20:19,327
- Well, what do you get?
- What do you mean?

525
00:20:19,329 --> 00:20:21,930
Well, you're on the hook for
a murder you didn't commit.

526
00:20:21,932 --> 00:20:24,099
You should negotiate.
You give Stansfield the phone,

527
00:20:24,101 --> 00:20:25,633
and he gives you the alternate suspect

528
00:20:25,635 --> 00:20:26,837
the lawyers think you need.

529
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:28,903
I mean, as long as you're
complicit in police corruption,

530
00:20:28,905 --> 00:20:30,538
- you might as well work it.
- I can't do that.

531
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:33,274
So if you simply hand over
the phone to Stansfield,

532
00:20:33,276 --> 00:20:35,543
- where does that leave you?
- Back to square one.

533
00:20:35,545 --> 00:20:37,212
No closer to figuring
out who killed Matthew,

534
00:20:37,214 --> 00:20:38,813
and the FBI still thinks I did it.

535
00:20:38,815 --> 00:20:41,182
Yeah, especially if you're the
last one holding onto this.

536
00:20:41,184 --> 00:20:44,686
It is a spectacularly bad time
for Dad to be out of town.

537
00:20:44,688 --> 00:20:46,588
What did I just tell you this morning?

538
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:48,356
We don't need anybody but us.

539
00:20:48,358 --> 00:20:49,691
Use what you've got, Steven.

540
00:20:49,693 --> 00:20:51,326
The sooner this is all over,

541
00:20:51,328 --> 00:20:53,161
the sooner you can get
back to saving the world,

542
00:20:53,163 --> 00:20:55,497
and I can get back to taking it over.

543
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:07,061
- Be good in there.
- I'll try.

544
00:21:07,386 --> 00:21:08,291
Hey, why don't you come with?

545
00:21:08,879 --> 00:21:11,395
I need somebody to keep me company
before I meet up with Jeff.

546
00:21:11,397 --> 00:21:13,096
Ah, I didn't really dress for the club.

547
00:21:13,098 --> 00:21:14,564
You're with me.

548
00:21:14,566 --> 00:21:16,199
No one'll be looking at you.

549
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:30,747
- Do you see Jeff?
- VIP's over there.

550
00:21:33,936 --> 00:21:35,052
I don't want Kori to see me yet.

551
00:21:35,054 --> 00:21:36,253
Not until Jeff fluffs her,

552
00:21:36,255 --> 00:21:38,344
gets her feeling a
little bit more generous.

553
00:21:38,379 --> 00:21:40,824
- Let's get a drink at the bar.
- Okay.

554
00:21:42,958 --> 00:21:43,659
Ugh!

555
00:21:43,708 --> 00:21:46,396
How do people live like this...
waiting in line?

556
00:21:46,398 --> 00:21:48,198
Uh, your Carrington's showing.

557
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,566
Southside?

558
00:21:49,568 --> 00:21:52,035
No. Club soda. I'm working.

559
00:21:56,542 --> 00:21:59,509
Fallon Carrington. Hi.

560
00:21:59,511 --> 00:22:02,199
Robby. What a surprise.

561
00:22:02,234 --> 00:22:04,324
Yeah. Kori Rucks texted me
and told me to come out.

562
00:22:04,359 --> 00:22:05,536
You remember Kori, right?

563
00:22:05,571 --> 00:22:06,807
I didn't know you'd be here tonight.

564
00:22:07,319 --> 00:22:08,218
It's been a while, hasn't it?

565
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:09,719
Like, seven and a half months, yeah.

566
00:22:09,721 --> 00:22:11,188
- Oh, wow. We're keeping track.
- You know, I've been

567
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:12,823
texting you,
and I know you've been getting them.

568
00:22:12,825 --> 00:22:15,417
- About St. Barths?
- I thought that already happened.

569
00:22:15,452 --> 00:22:16,927
It did, but I can always go back.

570
00:22:16,929 --> 00:22:19,396
- What's your schedule like?
- Um...

571
00:22:19,398 --> 00:22:22,232
Robby, this is my boyfriend, Michael.

572
00:22:22,234 --> 00:22:24,835
Robby and I went to school together.

573
00:22:25,807 --> 00:22:26,970
It's like a reunion up in here.

574
00:22:26,972 --> 00:22:29,071
Did you go to, uh, Penley, too?

575
00:22:29,106 --> 00:22:30,211
Decatur.

576
00:22:30,246 --> 00:22:31,174
Public.

577
00:22:31,176 --> 00:22:32,409
Wow.

578
00:22:33,345 --> 00:22:34,611
Uh, good for you, man.

579
00:22:34,613 --> 00:22:36,279
And, uh, good to see you, Fallon.

580
00:22:36,281 --> 00:22:37,881
You, too.

581
00:22:42,164 --> 00:22:42,953
Boyfriend?

582
00:22:43,839 --> 00:22:45,322
Let's dance.

583
00:23:23,633 --> 00:23:24,794
I am blowing up.

584
00:23:26,865 --> 00:23:29,399
"Cristal Carrington Sex Tape"?
Is that real?

585
00:23:29,401 --> 00:23:30,734
Oh, it's real.

586
00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:32,769
How do you know?

587
00:23:32,771 --> 00:23:35,172
Educated guess. Excuse me.

588
00:23:35,174 --> 00:23:37,841
I have to make some calls.

589
00:23:37,843 --> 00:23:39,509
Glad this is behind us.

590
00:23:40,243 --> 00:23:42,512
Now, it's best that doesn't make it back

591
00:23:42,514 --> 00:23:43,713
to police headquarters.

592
00:23:43,715 --> 00:23:47,284
Shouldn't make it back
to my father, either.

593
00:23:47,286 --> 00:23:49,619
This is between us.

594
00:23:52,791 --> 00:23:55,325
What are you doing?

595
00:23:55,327 --> 00:23:58,428
You have your money back,
your friend is safe...

596
00:23:58,430 --> 00:23:59,696
But I'm not.

597
00:23:59,698 --> 00:24:03,099
I want to make sure there's
no misunderstanding here.

598
00:24:03,101 --> 00:24:05,702
By giving you this,
I'm giving you a second chance.

599
00:24:05,704 --> 00:24:07,704
It's an opportunity
to make things right.

600
00:24:07,706 --> 00:24:09,105
Not just for me.

601
00:24:09,107 --> 00:24:12,008
The Blaisdel family deserves closure.

602
00:24:12,010 --> 00:24:14,077
Matthew deserves justice.

603
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:16,246
That's your responsibility now.

604
00:24:20,331 --> 00:24:23,420
You want me to find the real killer,
but I already told you,

605
00:24:23,422 --> 00:24:25,322
it's the FBI's case now.

606
00:24:25,324 --> 00:24:27,591
And I'm telling you, I don't care.

607
00:24:28,622 --> 00:24:29,759
Do your job.

608
00:24:30,702 --> 00:24:31,962
Close the case.

609
00:24:33,832 --> 00:24:35,165
Understood.

610
00:24:37,536 --> 00:24:38,902
Have you seen this?

611
00:24:38,904 --> 00:24:40,403
Oh, more than seen it.

612
00:24:40,405 --> 00:24:42,339
Honestly,
I did not expect the landing strip.

613
00:24:42,341 --> 00:24:43,473
Okay, don't be a perv.

614
00:24:43,475 --> 00:24:45,675
Speaking of pervs,
did you see Robby Reid?

615
00:24:45,677 --> 00:24:48,678
On his way out.
He said he met your boyfriend.

616
00:24:49,484 --> 00:24:50,747
And here I was thinking
that you're not dating

617
00:24:50,749 --> 00:24:52,115
because you're a workaholic,

618
00:24:52,117 --> 00:24:54,251
but you're just multitasking
by screwing your driver.

619
00:24:54,253 --> 00:24:57,053
God, no. I just told him
that so he'd get off my back.

620
00:24:57,055 --> 00:24:58,364
What? It worked.

621
00:25:00,002 --> 00:25:01,358
I'm sorry. It just won't stop.

622
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,226
And what about Kori and Jeff?

623
00:25:03,228 --> 00:25:05,762
Aren't you supposed to swoop
in there and close that deal?

624
00:25:05,764 --> 00:25:07,664
I know. I know. I'll be right back.

625
00:25:13,662 --> 00:25:15,572
I know Fallon has her blind spots.

626
00:25:15,574 --> 00:25:16,740
I hadn't noticed.

627
00:25:16,742 --> 00:25:18,275
But I'm telling you,

628
00:25:18,277 --> 00:25:20,644
if there's one thing she does know,
it's energy.

629
00:25:20,646 --> 00:25:22,112
It's in her blood.

630
00:25:22,114 --> 00:25:24,024
Of course. She's a Carrington.

631
00:25:24,059 --> 00:25:25,815
But that's the problem.

632
00:25:25,817 --> 00:25:29,452
The city of Atlanta is not gonna
be a pawn in their family feud.

633
00:25:30,185 --> 00:25:31,580
This contract will determine

634
00:25:31,615 --> 00:25:32,689
whether people can keep their lights on,

635
00:25:32,691 --> 00:25:35,125
and I don't trust Fallon Carrington

636
00:25:35,127 --> 00:25:37,093
to think of them when it counts.

637
00:25:37,996 --> 00:25:39,229
Do you trust me?

638
00:25:39,231 --> 00:25:40,430
You went into business with her.

639
00:25:40,432 --> 00:25:42,299
That means it's my business, too.

640
00:25:42,301 --> 00:25:45,835
You know I'll do right
by you and by this city.

641
00:25:45,837 --> 00:25:48,471
If you'll at least hear her out,

642
00:25:48,473 --> 00:25:51,539
I promise I'll hold her to her word.

643
00:25:51,574 --> 00:25:53,610
I will, for you.

644
00:25:56,862 --> 00:26:00,517
You know, I think my sister
invited her out tonight.

645
00:26:02,599 --> 00:26:03,620
I'll get us another bottle.

646
00:26:07,092 --> 00:26:09,426
Yo. Where's Fallon?
And why are you drinking?

647
00:26:10,410 --> 00:26:12,362
I thought you were her ride.

648
00:26:12,364 --> 00:26:14,864
- Not anymore.
- Just tell your girlfriend I'm looking for her, okay?

649
00:26:14,866 --> 00:26:17,801
- She's not my girlfriend.
- Sure looked like she was the other night at the gala.

650
00:26:19,107 --> 00:26:21,340
Talk to Fallon, okay?

651
00:26:21,342 --> 00:26:23,543
I've never gotten a
straight answer out of her.

652
00:26:23,545 --> 00:26:25,711
Maybe you will.

653
00:26:26,981 --> 00:26:28,347
Hey, wait up.

654
00:26:32,992 --> 00:26:34,620
Why don't you join us for a drink?

655
00:26:35,924 --> 00:26:38,090
Okay.

656
00:26:39,794 --> 00:26:42,895
Kori, this is Michael Culhane.

657
00:26:42,897 --> 00:26:45,331
He's a... friend.

658
00:26:45,333 --> 00:26:47,600
Mm.

659
00:26:49,537 --> 00:26:51,704
A single friend?

660
00:26:53,875 --> 00:26:56,008
I believe he is.

661
00:26:58,744 --> 00:27:00,477
Can you just admit that we're lost?

662
00:27:00,479 --> 00:27:03,146
Well, I will admit that I should've
paid for street lamps out here,

663
00:27:03,148 --> 00:27:04,414
'cause I can't see a damn thing.

664
00:27:04,416 --> 00:27:05,815
Maybe I should look at the map.

665
00:27:08,954 --> 00:27:11,454
Good luck.

666
00:27:12,079 --> 00:27:13,957
So, the sun set that way,

667
00:27:13,959 --> 00:27:16,226
which means...

668
00:27:16,228 --> 00:27:18,895
we've been going north this whole time.

669
00:27:18,897 --> 00:27:21,931
Blake, I told you we were
going in the wrong direction.

670
00:27:21,933 --> 00:27:24,000
Look, we're probably
all the way over here now.

671
00:27:24,362 --> 00:27:25,461
By this ranger station.

672
00:27:25,463 --> 00:27:27,197
Well, maybe they can help us.

673
00:27:27,232 --> 00:27:28,798
I'd be willing to ask directions.

674
00:27:30,385 --> 00:27:32,168
Do you seriously expect me to believe

675
00:27:32,170 --> 00:27:34,003
that you accidentally led us

676
00:27:34,005 --> 00:27:35,672
straight to the ranger station?

677
00:27:35,674 --> 00:27:38,775
Are you actually that desperate
to check your messages?

678
00:27:38,777 --> 00:27:41,110
I told you it wasn't a good time,
but you insisted.

679
00:27:41,112 --> 00:27:42,445
So you admit it.

680
00:27:42,447 --> 00:27:44,747
You did bring us here on purpose.

681
00:27:44,749 --> 00:27:46,482
God!

682
00:27:46,484 --> 00:27:48,618
I can't believe I thought we could have

683
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:51,354
one whole day together
without the world pressing in.

684
00:27:53,291 --> 00:27:55,992
Oh. And there it is.

685
00:27:57,162 --> 00:27:59,095
Well, you came all this way for service.

686
00:27:59,097 --> 00:28:00,530
You might as well have a look.

687
00:28:06,304 --> 00:28:08,571
Oh, hell.

688
00:28:11,076 --> 00:28:12,608
Oh, my God.

689
00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:15,278
Did they find the robber?

690
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,447
Oh, my God.

691
00:28:17,449 --> 00:28:18,881
What is this?

692
00:28:18,883 --> 00:28:21,951
Looks like it's you and Matthew.

693
00:28:21,953 --> 00:28:24,153
- All over the Internet.
- _

694
00:28:29,861 --> 00:28:32,228
Are you... filming me?

695
00:28:43,408 --> 00:28:45,641
Stop. Let me film you.

696
00:28:59,747 --> 00:29:01,681
I want my lawyers here, now.

697
00:29:01,683 --> 00:29:04,150
Waiting in the study, sir.

698
00:29:04,152 --> 00:29:06,486
Perhaps we suggest they move in.

699
00:29:15,556 --> 00:29:17,089
I'm sorry, what?!

700
00:29:17,091 --> 00:29:18,462
Your "friend" did that to me?

701
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:20,798
- Ow.
- How could you let this happen, Sam?

702
00:29:21,633 --> 00:29:24,093
I don't know.
I guess he had a fail-safe.

703
00:29:24,136 --> 00:29:27,036
Or he lied and he had already sold it.

704
00:29:27,534 --> 00:29:28,704
I'm sorry.

705
00:29:28,706 --> 00:29:31,073
Steven didn't tell me he was
gonna get the cops involved.

706
00:29:31,075 --> 00:29:32,675
You told Steven about this?

707
00:29:32,677 --> 00:29:33,843
About the robbery?

708
00:29:33,845 --> 00:29:35,945
Well, I had to. I didn't have the money.

709
00:29:36,881 --> 00:29:39,048
And I might have fudged
some of the details.

710
00:29:39,050 --> 00:29:42,904
I told Steven I didn't know
they were gonna rob the house.

711
00:29:42,988 --> 00:29:44,620
So that's how you didn't get arrested.

712
00:29:44,622 --> 00:29:46,222
Well, I did it to protect you, too.

713
00:29:46,224 --> 00:29:48,624
If I told him I did it and about my mom,

714
00:29:48,626 --> 00:29:49,886
then he'd ask what you knew.

715
00:29:49,962 --> 00:29:51,894
And if he told Blake...

716
00:29:54,766 --> 00:29:57,600
I-I thought I fixed it, Cristal.
I'm sorry.

717
00:29:59,437 --> 00:30:01,003
What are they saying about me?

718
00:30:01,005 --> 00:30:02,271
Cristal...

719
00:30:02,273 --> 00:30:04,807
Just rip the Band-Aid off, Sam.

720
00:30:08,813 --> 00:30:10,413
"Million-Dollar Tramp."

721
00:30:10,415 --> 00:30:14,116
"Naked Ambition."

722
00:30:14,118 --> 00:30:16,886
And, uh, this one's kind of clever:

723
00:30:16,888 --> 00:30:19,322
"Private Relations."

724
00:30:19,324 --> 00:30:21,757
Like, they crossed out "public."

725
00:30:21,759 --> 00:30:23,726
It's charming.

726
00:30:23,728 --> 00:30:25,928
I'm Atlanta's biggest slut.

727
00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:29,899
Well, I can't speak to that, but...

728
00:30:29,901 --> 00:30:31,868
looks like Fallon can.

729
00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:33,236
Fallon, Fallon!
Can you comment on

730
00:30:33,238 --> 00:30:34,403
the sex tape that's just surfaced?

731
00:30:34,405 --> 00:30:36,372
Uh, well,
I know about as much as you do.

732
00:30:36,374 --> 00:30:38,508
You know, I can't comment on
somebody else's proclivities.

733
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:40,776
I think those are questions
for the movie star.

734
00:30:43,047 --> 00:30:45,348
That bitch.

735
00:30:48,653 --> 00:30:49,919
Willy.

736
00:30:49,921 --> 00:30:51,587
Uh, I wasn't sure you'd pick up.

737
00:30:51,589 --> 00:30:52,788
I've tried everyone.

738
00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:53,850
Stansfield hung up on me.

739
00:30:53,892 --> 00:30:55,208
The FBI won't even call me back.

740
00:30:55,293 --> 00:30:57,293
The FBI? What's going on?

741
00:30:57,295 --> 00:30:59,362
You've seen this tape of Matthew
and Cristal, haven't you?

742
00:30:59,364 --> 00:31:00,596
Unfortunately.

743
00:31:00,598 --> 00:31:01,764
Has Claudia?

744
00:31:01,766 --> 00:31:03,499
Yeah, she's seen it.

745
00:31:03,501 --> 00:31:05,334
I just got back from her house.
She's a mess.

746
00:31:05,336 --> 00:31:07,270
She may not be able
to fight for herself,

747
00:31:07,272 --> 00:31:09,405
but you can be damn sure
I'm gonna fight for her.

748
00:31:09,407 --> 00:31:11,063
This tape... i-it's motive.

749
00:31:11,109 --> 00:31:13,843
Blake didn't want his new wife's
old boyfriend hanging around.

750
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,646
Wait.

751
00:31:16,648 --> 00:31:18,681
You still think my dad killed Matthew?

752
00:31:18,683 --> 00:31:19,982
It wasn't you.

753
00:31:19,984 --> 00:31:21,150
You were Matthew's friend.

754
00:31:21,152 --> 00:31:23,653
Maybe the only good
one left in that house.

755
00:31:25,290 --> 00:31:28,291
Where are you right now?
I'm coming to meet you.

756
00:31:28,751 --> 00:31:30,426
As I've told everyone else,

757
00:31:30,428 --> 00:31:31,677
this is between my father

758
00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:33,603
and his surprisingly flexible new bride.

759
00:31:33,666 --> 00:31:36,933
It's a private family matter.

760
00:31:36,935 --> 00:31:38,768
About as private as a circus.

761
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:40,169
Hey.

762
00:31:41,297 --> 00:31:42,939
What happened to you last night?

763
00:31:42,941 --> 00:31:45,141
I came to find you. You were gone.

764
00:31:45,143 --> 00:31:47,310
Well, I had every newspaper in Atlanta

765
00:31:47,312 --> 00:31:49,312
calling me about Cristal's porno.

766
00:31:49,314 --> 00:31:50,513
I texted you.

767
00:31:50,515 --> 00:31:53,182
That's why you bailed on our plan?

768
00:31:53,184 --> 00:31:56,419
To give interviews about
your stepmother's sex tape?

769
00:31:56,421 --> 00:32:00,423
You took your eye off the prize
to take a swipe at Cristal.

770
00:32:00,425 --> 00:32:02,686
You really can't help yourself, can you?

771
00:32:02,727 --> 00:32:04,121
Well, she's not just my stepmother.

772
00:32:04,162 --> 00:32:06,562
She's also the new COO
of our main competition

773
00:32:06,564 --> 00:32:07,997
of this new deal we're trying to strike.

774
00:32:07,999 --> 00:32:09,599
That's right.<i> We.</i>

775
00:32:09,601 --> 00:32:11,267
And I was there for you, Fallon.

776
00:32:11,269 --> 00:32:14,570
I put myself on the line
for a deal you had to have.

777
00:32:14,572 --> 00:32:16,238
But you made me look like an idiot,

778
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,770
because you're only out for yourself.

779
00:32:17,843 --> 00:32:20,710
Must be genetic.

780
00:32:20,712 --> 00:32:24,614
And speaking of our main competition,
congratulations.

781
00:32:24,616 --> 00:32:26,515
Carrington Atlantic lost the contract.

782
00:32:26,517 --> 00:32:27,883
Kori just called me.

783
00:32:27,885 --> 00:32:30,987
- Wait, we got it?
- No. Southern Power did.

784
00:32:30,989 --> 00:32:33,255
The Morell Corp presentation

785
00:32:33,257 --> 00:32:36,325
wasn't concrete enough
for the city council.

786
00:32:36,327 --> 00:32:38,661
That was all you, remember?

787
00:32:39,734 --> 00:32:43,566
I'm guessing you didn't
play team sports as a kid.

788
00:32:43,568 --> 00:32:45,935
But we're supposed to
be in this together.

789
00:32:45,937 --> 00:32:49,271
You're no longer the only one
who pays for your mistakes.

790
00:32:51,576 --> 00:32:53,009
Willy?

791
00:32:53,011 --> 00:32:55,144
It's Steven.

792
00:33:20,872 --> 00:33:23,072
Hello?

793
00:33:30,356 --> 00:33:31,388
<i>I just can't believe it.</i>

794
00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:33,390
Toxicology will confirm

795
00:33:33,392 --> 00:33:35,025
his death looks like a suicide.

796
00:33:35,027 --> 00:33:37,627
He had a bottle of
sleeping pills next to him.

797
00:33:37,629 --> 00:33:39,296
And there was a note

798
00:33:39,298 --> 00:33:42,199
claiming responsibility for
the Windbriar explosion.

799
00:33:42,201 --> 00:33:43,567
That doesn't make sense.

800
00:33:43,569 --> 00:33:45,369
Willy called me,

801
00:33:45,371 --> 00:33:46,937
and I didn't see a note.

802
00:33:46,939 --> 00:33:49,239
One of my detectives
discovered it in the bedroom.

803
00:33:49,241 --> 00:33:53,310
And it seems Willy was
angry at Carrington Atlantic

804
00:33:53,312 --> 00:33:55,779
for twice denying him a promotion.

805
00:33:55,781 --> 00:33:57,581
So he killed Matthew?

806
00:33:57,583 --> 00:33:58,882
Apparently he didn't intend to.

807
00:33:58,884 --> 00:34:00,817
He was trying to sabotage the operation

808
00:34:00,819 --> 00:34:03,653
and damage Carrington
Atlantic equipment.

809
00:34:03,655 --> 00:34:05,222
His friend Matthew

810
00:34:05,224 --> 00:34:07,391
was collateral damage, it seems.

811
00:34:07,393 --> 00:34:09,359
And then seeing his name dragged

812
00:34:09,361 --> 00:34:11,595
through the mud these last 24 hours...

813
00:34:11,597 --> 00:34:13,230
it was too much.

814
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:15,665
Does the FBI know about this?

815
00:34:15,667 --> 00:34:16,933
They've already been alerted.

816
00:34:16,935 --> 00:34:19,070
And, um, they're confirming his story,

817
00:34:19,105 --> 00:34:20,871
but it's just a formality.

818
00:34:20,873 --> 00:34:23,340
And once the toxicology comes out,

819
00:34:23,342 --> 00:34:26,143
charges against you will be dropped.

820
00:34:26,145 --> 00:34:27,978
The Horse Whisperer rides again.

821
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:29,146
What about Claudia?

822
00:34:29,148 --> 00:34:30,180
Has anyone spoken to her?

823
00:34:30,182 --> 00:34:31,782
We're sending someone over now.

824
00:34:31,784 --> 00:34:33,016
Oh, my God.

825
00:34:33,018 --> 00:34:35,085
It's not how we expected this to end,

826
00:34:35,087 --> 00:34:37,421
but at least...

827
00:34:37,423 --> 00:34:39,856
she'll finally have some closure.

828
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:44,394
Hey.

829
00:34:46,265 --> 00:34:47,564
I don't understand.

830
00:34:47,566 --> 00:34:49,266
It's been a rough day, hasn't it?

831
00:34:50,925 --> 00:34:52,702
While I'm here...

832
00:34:52,704 --> 00:34:55,071
I believe you have something for me.

833
00:35:04,716 --> 00:35:06,183
Hey.

834
00:35:07,352 --> 00:35:08,919
You okay?

835
00:35:08,954 --> 00:35:11,621
No.

836
00:35:11,623 --> 00:35:12,856
I was there.

837
00:35:12,858 --> 00:35:14,891
I saw Willy, and I didn't see a note.

838
00:35:14,893 --> 00:35:17,861
And what, then Stansfield's
guy just happens to find one?

839
00:35:17,863 --> 00:35:19,763
That lets us all off the hook?

840
00:35:19,765 --> 00:35:21,598
If anything,
shouldn't I be more of a suspect?

841
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,866
I was the one that found him.

842
00:35:22,868 --> 00:35:24,000
What are you trying to say, Steven?

843
00:35:24,002 --> 00:35:26,303
Just...

844
00:35:26,305 --> 00:35:27,471
It seems off.

845
00:35:27,473 --> 00:35:29,172
A week ago, Willy was in this house,

846
00:35:29,174 --> 00:35:31,107
accusing you of killing Matthew.

847
00:35:31,142 --> 00:35:33,128
Why would he suddenly admit it now?

848
00:35:33,163 --> 00:35:35,345
Guilt is an unpredictable animal.

849
00:35:35,347 --> 00:35:37,214
Or Stansfield is.

850
00:35:37,216 --> 00:35:38,381
I know you're shaken right now.

851
00:35:38,383 --> 00:35:39,749
We've all been through the wringer.

852
00:35:39,751 --> 00:35:41,751
But Stansfield is not a bad guy.

853
00:35:43,155 --> 00:35:45,322
He's only helped this family.

854
00:35:59,058 --> 00:36:00,370
Whoa.

855
00:36:00,372 --> 00:36:02,939
Did someone go a little too
hard at the club last night?

856
00:36:02,941 --> 00:36:04,541
No, I'm just beat.

857
00:36:04,543 --> 00:36:06,476
Ugh. Me, too.

858
00:36:06,478 --> 00:36:10,080
And if I have to take one more
call to comment on this video...

859
00:36:10,082 --> 00:36:12,941
It's not even news anymore.
Even I'm over it.

860
00:36:12,976 --> 00:36:14,718
- Are you?
- Sorry?

861
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,453
Well, you took that phone, didn't you?

862
00:36:16,455 --> 00:36:17,954
You leaked the video.

863
00:36:17,956 --> 00:36:19,556
I didn't take the phone.

864
00:36:20,179 --> 00:36:21,958
You're like a human bulldozer.

865
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,527
- And you'll crush anyone.
- Please.

866
00:36:23,529 --> 00:36:24,828
Cristal's a big girl, Michael.

867
00:36:24,830 --> 00:36:26,296
She doesn't need you defending her.

868
00:36:26,298 --> 00:36:28,732
Maybe someone should defend the
world from Fallon Carrington.

869
00:36:29,673 --> 00:36:31,601
The way you treat her,
the way you treated Kori...

870
00:36:32,662 --> 00:36:33,870
Kori?

871
00:36:34,706 --> 00:36:36,806
You just don't see other people.

872
00:36:36,808 --> 00:36:39,109
Kori just hates me because I
was a bitch in high school.

873
00:36:39,111 --> 00:36:41,411
And I was a bitch because when
your mom leaves in the middle

874
00:36:41,413 --> 00:36:43,246
of sophomore year,
it kind of messes with your head.

875
00:36:43,248 --> 00:36:45,916
I mean, if I didn't defend myself,
who would've?

876
00:36:49,588 --> 00:36:50,921
That is heartbreaking.

877
00:36:51,736 --> 00:36:53,857
But it was almost ten years ago.

878
00:36:53,859 --> 00:36:55,525
Maybe you should stop blaming your mom

879
00:36:55,527 --> 00:36:58,428
and try to figure out why
you're so screwed up now.

880
00:37:15,484 --> 00:37:17,180
Hey.

881
00:37:17,182 --> 00:37:20,050
I'm sorry I didn't get a
chance to congratulate you.

882
00:37:20,052 --> 00:37:22,419
I was actually coming
to apologize to you.

883
00:37:23,136 --> 00:37:25,188
What you said yesterday,
about my privilege...

884
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:27,357
you were right.

885
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:28,992
I should have been honest.

886
00:37:28,994 --> 00:37:31,461
I was trying to protect you, but...

887
00:37:32,132 --> 00:37:33,671
I just ended up hurting more people.

888
00:37:33,706 --> 00:37:34,982
Don't feel too bad.

889
00:37:35,017 --> 00:37:36,433
You were right about that guy.

890
00:37:36,435 --> 00:37:38,501
I shouldn't have trusted him.

891
00:37:38,503 --> 00:37:41,771
But the thing is...
I should've been arrested, too.

892
00:37:41,773 --> 00:37:43,740
What? Why?

893
00:37:43,742 --> 00:37:45,342
Because I set it up.

894
00:37:47,635 --> 00:37:49,846
I told him to steal my aunt's ring.

895
00:37:50,258 --> 00:37:51,457
Are you kidding me?

896
00:37:51,459 --> 00:37:52,658
I know.

897
00:37:53,595 --> 00:37:55,728
But my mom needed money,
fast, and I panicked.

898
00:37:55,730 --> 00:37:57,964
You're the reason that
all of this has happened?

899
00:37:57,966 --> 00:37:59,833
It got out of control.
And I needed you to help me,

900
00:37:59,915 --> 00:38:01,848
and I didn't think you would
if I told you the truth.

901
00:38:01,850 --> 00:38:03,416
- You're damn right I wouldn't.
- I know how much

902
00:38:03,418 --> 00:38:05,485
you hate being lied to;
that's why I wanted to come clean.

903
00:38:05,487 --> 00:38:06,720
What, you think that fixes this?

904
00:38:07,482 --> 00:38:08,221
I did all of this help you,

905
00:38:08,223 --> 00:38:10,257
and now you're telling me
that it's all your fault?

906
00:38:10,259 --> 00:38:11,591
I know. I'm sorry.

907
00:38:12,721 --> 00:38:13,627
Well, I don't accept that.

908
00:38:14,681 --> 00:38:16,663
And I get now why your
aunt didn't want you here.

909
00:38:23,878 --> 00:38:26,479
The press isn't going away.

910
00:38:26,481 --> 00:38:28,514
I think I need to make a statement.

911
00:38:28,516 --> 00:38:29,816
I'm not gonna make you do that again.

912
00:38:29,818 --> 00:38:32,819
Let the FBI tell them about Willy.

913
00:38:32,821 --> 00:38:34,554
It's not about Willy.

914
00:38:34,556 --> 00:38:37,423
I didn't get a say in
this thing getting out.

915
00:38:37,425 --> 00:38:39,025
I should have told you about the phone.

916
00:38:41,896 --> 00:38:44,097
I should have told
you about the robbery.

917
00:38:44,099 --> 00:38:45,565
After the fact,

918
00:38:45,567 --> 00:38:47,400
Sam told me that it was his friend

919
00:38:47,402 --> 00:38:48,835
and that he was involved.

920
00:38:48,837 --> 00:38:52,405
And I should have told you,
but he's a good kid, Blake.

921
00:38:52,407 --> 00:38:54,173
He made a mistake.

922
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:59,278
Well, on any other day,
I would probably be upset,

923
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:02,915
but... I made a mistake, too.

924
00:39:03,749 --> 00:39:05,618
Do you remember the day

925
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:08,321
we took our engagement photos
and Matthew came to the house?

926
00:39:08,323 --> 00:39:08,923
Of course.

927
00:39:08,924 --> 00:39:10,201
And I told you we didn't argue.

928
00:39:10,259 --> 00:39:11,958
Well, he threatened me with blackmail.

929
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:13,559
He said that you would not marry me

930
00:39:13,561 --> 00:39:15,428
if you knew what kind of man I was.

931
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:16,796
Blackmail you with what?

932
00:39:16,798 --> 00:39:19,565
Steven. Look, you know
that before Steven ran off

933
00:39:19,567 --> 00:39:22,969
to dig wells in Haiti that
he was with the company.

934
00:39:22,971 --> 00:39:24,070
He didn't want the job,

935
00:39:24,072 --> 00:39:25,972
and I pushed him up the ladder too fast.

936
00:39:25,974 --> 00:39:27,440
Out in the field one day,

937
00:39:27,442 --> 00:39:29,008
he missed a faulty pressure valve,

938
00:39:29,010 --> 00:39:30,843
and he signed off on the inspection.

939
00:39:30,845 --> 00:39:31,811
Oh, my God.

940
00:39:31,813 --> 00:39:33,346
Later, when they put it online,

941
00:39:33,348 --> 00:39:35,081
the pressure shook the rig,
a man fell off

942
00:39:35,083 --> 00:39:36,449
and snapped his neck.

943
00:39:36,451 --> 00:39:37,911
How come I never heard about this?

944
00:39:37,986 --> 00:39:39,919
Matthew was the field engineer on site.

945
00:39:39,921 --> 00:39:43,723
I asked him to write it
off as a structural defect.

946
00:39:43,725 --> 00:39:44,867
You covered it up.

947
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:47,894
And Matthew claimed to have
a record of it on his phone.

948
00:39:49,264 --> 00:39:51,531
<i>So, I knew if Steven ever found out</i>

949
00:39:51,533 --> 00:39:53,533
<i>he had something to do
with the man's death,</i>

950
00:39:53,535 --> 00:39:55,835
<i>he would never have
stopped blaming himself.</i>

951
00:39:55,837 --> 00:39:57,804
But the victim is described as...

952
00:39:57,806 --> 00:40:00,406
<i>I was trying to protect him.</i>

953
00:40:00,408 --> 00:40:02,875
I-I ended up sacrificing you.

954
00:40:02,877 --> 00:40:05,311
I'm-I'm so sorry, Cristal.

955
00:40:06,581 --> 00:40:08,815
I understand.

956
00:40:08,817 --> 00:40:11,417
I was just trying to protect Sam.

957
00:40:11,419 --> 00:40:13,186
That's what family does.

958
00:40:13,188 --> 00:40:16,189
<i>No matter how hard or how much it hurts.</i>

959
00:40:16,191 --> 00:40:19,192
<i>We stand by them.</i>

960
00:40:40,228 --> 00:40:41,180
<i>But you and I...</i>

961
00:40:43,618 --> 00:40:46,085
...I don't want us to have secrets.

962
00:40:46,087 --> 00:40:49,322
I want to trust you,
and I want you to trust me.

963
00:40:50,505 --> 00:40:52,525
Can we start again?

964
00:40:52,527 --> 00:40:54,961
Clean slate?

965
00:40:54,963 --> 00:40:56,829
No more lies.

966
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,200
No more lies.

967
