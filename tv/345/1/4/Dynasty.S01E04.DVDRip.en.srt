if we never had to go back?

If we found an island,
just the two of us?

No worries. Barefoot.

- I got it at a steal.

Why don't we go in the house

Don't you do that, Matthew.
Don't you walk away from me.

Don't treat me
like damaged goods.

Look, I didn't ask to come
back here. You asked me to.

All right.

We've been married how long?
Fifteen years?

97
00:08:13,417 --> 00:08:17,285
And we still can't exchange a lousy present
without punishing one another, can we?

98
00:08:17,387 --> 00:08:20,720
- Meaning what?
- Meaning--

99
00:08:22,793 --> 00:08:27,753
Meaning a couple of kids
fell in love and had a baby.

100

faster than was fun.

Bring in the richest field

At least that's what you said when you
dragged me into this damn fool operation.

00:14:11,675 --> 00:14:14,075
Oh, no, I won't be able to stay.

147
00:14:14,177 --> 00:14:17,704
I've got to find your husband.
It's kind of important.

148
00:14:20,517 --> 00:14:22,917
They're probably at Meadsburg.

149
00:14:33,263 --> 00:14:35,163
If you really want me to stay--

150
00:14:35,265 --> 00:14:38,291
No, it's okay, really.

Would you like a sandwich
or something for the road?

Yeah.

154
00:14:52,882 --> 00:14:54,850
Okay.

155
00:14:59,456 --> 00:15:02,186

Talk to him, stall him.

How about me, Matthew?
Now that you're on a losing streak.

Hey, Russell to Garvey here.
<i>(</i> Laughs <i>)</i>

Losing streak, huh?

I wouldn't be too sure about that, Bobby.
Because I think he made me win...

171
00:17:43,553 --> 00:17:46,920
so's I'd go back on the job--
in appreciation.

No, you won.
And as far as appreciation goes...

I'm not asking for anything.

Now you. You looking to get

Sure as hell don't need one

Yeah, well, you sure as hell
ain't gonna get one either, buster.

Not from me, not from anybody else

Cleaned out the jails,

Tried to give them a start, yeah.

190

That's the way they repay us--
stabbing us in the back, walking out.

191
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:58,357
- Well, they're bums. Scum!
- Hey, come on! Hold it, hold it.

192
00:18:58,461 --> 00:19:01,487
You think I can't take him,just 'cause
he's got two or three years on me?

So I tell you what.

- Huh?

213
00:20:29,552 --> 00:20:34,251
It's who his old man is. How he probably
sent him over here so's he could be his spy.

Now, we might be rabble and dregs...

but your old man is the biggest crook
who ever lived.

- My father's not a crook.
- You better go on home now, son.

217

He never walked off on a job.

He never let down
his friends in a jam.

236
00:22:31,074 --> 00:22:32,974
Well, you gotta admit.
He showed some spunk.

237
00:22:33,076 --> 00:22:36,102
Yeah, but you can't go around hiring everybody
just because they show a little spunk.

Walter, can't you find
anything good in somebody?

239

I mean he's not Blake Carrington.
He's his own man.

Okay. You win.
But we get no bucks by next Friday...

- ""Wait and see.''

251

Everything depends on which
one of those fanatics...

manages to kill off all the others
and come out on top.

Well, maybe he'll be a gentleman,
and turn those tankers loose.

254
00:23:44,981 --> 00:23:47,142
Maybe he'll just nationalize
the whole shooting match...

255
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:50,014
and trade it to the Russians
for MiG-21 's.

Andrew--

257
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:57,155
What kind of advances can we get
while our crude is tied up?

258
00:24:00,029 --> 00:24:02,122
Twenty cents on the dollar.
Maybe.

259
00:24:02,231 --> 00:24:06,497
- Where would that leave us?
- Bankruptcy. And that's the upside.

260
00:24:06,602 --> 00:24:10,436
Six operational offices
from Tangiers to Cape Town.

261
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:14,476
Payoffs to every swindling five-percenter
in sight, and we get caught like this?

262
00:24:16,913 --> 00:24:20,405
What dimwitted office boy thought
we ought to go in there in the first place?

263
00:24:20,516 --> 00:24:23,041
As I recall, Blake, it was you.

Well, I still think it was a good idea.

Fallon. How did you get in here?

266
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:31,556
Oh, I told the guard at the door
I was C.I.A. Undercover.

267
00:24:33,362 --> 00:24:36,456
Look. Daddy, I believe
your analogy at the time...

268
00:24:36,566 --> 00:24:39,262
had to do with
the grasshopper and the ants.

""The government isn't putting
anything by for a rainy day,'' you said.

""Maybe Denver Carrington should.''

271

Be a good girl and run along, will you?
I'm busy.

272
00:24:49,445 --> 00:24:54,747
Andrew, while we're ""waiting and seeing,''
is there anything else that I should know?

273
00:24:54,851 --> 00:24:57,752
Uh, about that
Lankershim-Blaisdel property.

274
00:24:57,854 --> 00:25:00,288

We attempt to cut off their money,
they get new backing.

277
00:25:06,262 --> 00:25:08,389
Every time we knock them down,
they get right back up.

278

- Spare me the details, Andrew.Just handle it.
- I understand, Blake.

279
00:25:12,568 --> 00:25:15,036
Well, your understanding isn't gonna
help us a hell of a whole lot...

280
00:25:15,137 --> 00:25:18,971
if we've got nothing to show our stockholders
when that other thing comes crashing down.

281
00:25:19,075 --> 00:25:22,238
So if your present methods are not working,
perhaps you'd better try--

282
00:25:22,345 --> 00:25:26,008
- A little Carrington hospitality.
- Fallon, would you please--

283
00:25:26,115 --> 00:25:29,414
Okay, okay, I'm going.
I'm only trying to say...

284
00:25:29,518 --> 00:25:32,282
that you might catch more flies with honey
than you are with buttermilk.

285
00:25:33,389 --> 00:25:36,256
- Out. Out, please.
- Daddy.

286
00:25:36,359 --> 00:25:38,987
- Out!
- Daddy, will you listen to me?

287
00:25:39,095 --> 00:25:41,859
Matthew Blaisdel
was your friend once.

288
00:25:41,964 --> 00:25:45,331
What would it hurt for you to invite him
into your home like a human being...

289
00:25:45,434 --> 00:25:49,632
and explain to him the advantages
of coming back into the company.

290
00:25:49,739 --> 00:25:53,334
And bringing his leases with him.

291
00:25:53,442 --> 00:25:56,411
Or are you so bloody jealous of
what went on between he and Krystle...

292
00:25:56,512 --> 00:25:59,709
<i>t</i>ha<i>t</i> y<i>o</i>u'd <i>re</i>a<i>ll</i>y <i>r</i>a<i>t</i>h<i>er</i> bus<i>t</i>
<i>Bl</i>a<i>i</i>sd<i>el t</i>ha<i>n</i> w<i>in</i> h<i>im o</i>v<i>er</i>?

293
00:26:02,652 --> 00:26:04,620
You may just have an idea.

294
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,688
You mean a brilliant idea.

295
00:26:06,789 --> 00:26:10,623
I mean, you've made your point.

296
00:26:10,726 --> 00:26:13,160
Now, will you get out of here?

297
00:26:26,976 --> 00:26:31,072
-Jeanette, who is it for dinner this evening?
-Just you and Mr. Carrington.

298
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:33,978
I'm setting a bit early because
there's a dance over in Magordo...

299
00:26:34,083 --> 00:26:36,677
and Joseph gave me
permission to go.

300
00:26:36,786 --> 00:26:40,381
Oh, of course.

301
00:26:40,489 --> 00:26:43,219
This room's so big, and
it'll be beautiful out tonight.

302
00:26:43,326 --> 00:26:45,294
I'd like to eat
out on the terrace.

303
00:26:47,663 --> 00:26:50,223
Well, you see, ma'am--

304
00:26:50,333 --> 00:26:53,496
Joseph prefers all evening meals
be served in the dining room.

305
00:26:55,237 --> 00:26:58,434
He-- He's liable
to have a snit if you--

306
00:27:07,883 --> 00:27:10,351
We'll eat in here.
It'll be fine.

307
00:27:12,188 --> 00:27:15,589
- Have a good time this evening.
- Thank you.

308
00:27:22,365 --> 00:27:24,333
You're not staying
for dinner, Andy?

309
00:27:24,433 --> 00:27:27,266
No, I have some things
to attend to this evening.

310
00:27:29,939 --> 00:27:31,907
Daddy's really in trouble
this time, isn't he?

311
00:27:32,008 --> 00:27:36,707
Well, you were there.
You heard. Or, rather, you overheard.

312
00:27:37,913 --> 00:27:40,507
What would it take
to bail him out?

313
00:27:40,616 --> 00:27:43,278
- More than your allowance, I'm afraid.
- How much?

314
00:27:43,386 --> 00:27:46,947
Forget it, Fallon.
There isn't anything you can do to help.

315
00:27:47,056 --> 00:27:51,015
You're pretty sure of that, aren't you?
You could be wrong, you know.

316
00:27:52,828 --> 00:27:55,956
- You love him a lot, don't you?
- You know I do.

317
00:27:56,999 --> 00:27:58,933
But you don't love Krystle a lot.

318
00:28:00,636 --> 00:28:02,627
You really fixed her good
this time, didn't you?

319
00:28:02,738 --> 00:28:07,641
Got your father to thinking about
inviting Matthew Blaisdel over here.

320
00:28:07,743 --> 00:28:11,873
It's the smartest thing for him to do,
Andy. I don't have to tell you that.

321
00:28:11,981 --> 00:28:14,711
It will also make Krystle crazy.

322
00:28:14,817 --> 00:28:16,978
You don't have to tell me that either.

323
00:28:17,086 --> 00:28:21,318
And you figure that by chipping away
at her, little by little...

324
00:28:21,424 --> 00:28:23,551
you'll be able to drive her out
of this house, hmm?

325
00:28:23,659 --> 00:28:26,958
She's no good for him.
She'll just drag him down.

326
00:28:27,063 --> 00:28:32,091
You know, Fallon--
most little girls realize by the age of six...

327
00:28:32,201 --> 00:28:35,466
that they can't grow up
and marry their daddies.

328
00:28:39,275 --> 00:28:42,301
Friends shouldn't fight.

329
00:28:42,411 --> 00:28:44,777
You're right. Bye, Andy.

330
00:29:04,867 --> 00:29:08,462
You know, honey?
I've been thinking. I was--

331
00:29:10,339 --> 00:29:14,639
Well, I was kind of rough
on you this morning. So--

332
00:29:14,743 --> 00:29:19,009
Well, I thought I'd take
the car back and then...

333
00:29:19,115 --> 00:29:22,107
well, when you're ready,
you'll be ready.

334
00:29:25,521 --> 00:29:28,786
I was out at the rig
to see you today.

335
00:29:28,891 --> 00:29:31,792
- You were?
- Uh-huh.

336
00:29:31,894 --> 00:29:34,158
- How'd you get there?
- <i>(</i> Chuckles <i>)</i>

337
00:29:35,564 --> 00:29:38,556
I-- I drove.
<i>(</i> Laughing <i>)</i>

338
00:29:38,667 --> 00:29:41,158
Come on.

339
00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:46,799
- Come on.
- I drove. You got me a car, didn't you?

340
00:29:53,549 --> 00:29:57,679
- That's good, honey. That's real good.
- Mm.

341
00:29:59,255 --> 00:30:02,190
What's real good...

342
00:30:02,291 --> 00:30:05,886
is that I felt like myself today
for the first time.

343
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:10,828
Slugging it out with you
this morning helped.

344
00:30:12,368 --> 00:30:14,768
So.

345
00:30:14,870 --> 00:30:19,830
I want to thank you for
letting me fight with you.

346
00:30:21,644 --> 00:30:23,805
<i>(</i> Sighs <i>)</i>

347
00:30:25,414 --> 00:30:29,475
Fighting. Driving.

348
00:30:29,585 --> 00:30:32,315
All in one day.

349
00:30:32,421 --> 00:30:35,219
Anything else you care to try?

350
00:30:36,325 --> 00:30:39,317
I don't know.

351
00:30:39,428 --> 00:30:42,158
Maybe I'll think of something.

352
00:30:43,199 --> 00:30:45,167
<i>(</i> Chuckles <i>)</i>

353
00:30:49,405 --> 00:30:52,431
- You're getting me all wet.
- Oh, I'm sorry. I'll just--

354
00:30:52,541 --> 00:30:57,274
No. I'll take your towel.

355
00:31:09,658 --> 00:31:11,558
- <i>(</i> Chuckling <i>)</i> No, no, no.
- Yeah.

356
00:31:22,404 --> 00:31:24,838
Hold on a minute.
Don't we know you?

357
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:27,431
Morning, Dad. Krystle.

358
00:31:27,543 --> 00:31:30,444
Hi, Steven.
What happened to your face?

359
00:31:31,647 --> 00:31:34,309
Uh, nothing.
Just a little accident.

360
00:31:35,851 --> 00:31:38,081
Where've you been? We haven't seen you
since we've been back.

361
00:31:38,187 --> 00:31:41,850
- I've been around.
- New means of transportation?

362
00:31:41,957 --> 00:31:44,187
Yeah,just a little
something I picked up.

363
00:31:45,961 --> 00:31:49,658
By the way, when are you gonna let me
know what job you're going to take?

364
00:31:50,933 --> 00:31:55,802
I already have a job.
But not with your company.

365
00:31:55,904 --> 00:31:58,873
- Oh? Who's it with?
- You're not going to like it.

366
00:31:58,974 --> 00:32:00,839
Let me be the judge.

367
00:32:03,512 --> 00:32:05,480
I'm working for Matthew Blaisdel.

368
00:32:12,921 --> 00:32:15,116
You're right. I don't like it.

369
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:20,954
Dad, I thought you'd appreciate it...

370
00:32:21,063 --> 00:32:24,226
that I'm trying to learn the business.

371
00:32:24,333 --> 00:32:27,825
You see, I don't want to be
just Blake Carrington's son.

372
00:32:27,936 --> 00:32:31,235
LikeJeff, standing around,
waiting to be Cecil's gofer.

373
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:34,309
Y<i>o</i>u w<i>ere</i> b<i>ro</i>ugh<i>t</i> up
<i>t</i>h<i>e</i> ha<i>r</i>d way, <i>ri</i>gh<i>t</i>?

374
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:39,541
Well, I want to be the same.
You've got to appreciate that.

375
00:32:40,716 --> 00:32:44,345
Yes, yes. I do.
But why him?

376
00:32:44,453 --> 00:32:49,720
Well, why not him? Unless what Walter
accuses you of is true.

377
00:32:49,825 --> 00:32:52,350
That you tried to wreck the rig...

378
00:32:52,461 --> 00:32:54,725
and that you're trying to run them
out of business.

379
00:32:56,031 --> 00:32:58,397
All right, you want
to work on a rig. Fine.

380
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:01,230
I've got 22 of them.
I'll put you on one of mine.

381
00:33:01,337 --> 00:33:03,703
- No.
- Why <i>not</i>?

382
00:33:03,806 --> 00:33:06,673
Because I have finally
done something on my own.

383
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:12,503
<i>Bein</i>g y<i>o</i>u<i>r</i> s<i>on</i>,
<i>it</i> was<i>n</i>'<i>t t</i>ha<i>t e</i>asy.

384
00:33:12,614 --> 00:33:16,209
It wasn't easy for me, either,
being your father.

385
00:33:25,561 --> 00:33:27,586
<i>(</i> Engine Starts <i>)</i>

386
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:41,471
You were pretty hard on him, Blake.
He's young.

387
00:33:41,577 --> 00:33:46,879
And he's my son.
And I'll deal with him. My way.

388
00:33:57,426 --> 00:34:00,691
- Mrs. Carrington.
- Mrs. Carrington.

389
00:34:00,796 --> 00:34:04,027
- Peter, may I talk to you for a moment?
- Of course, Mrs. Carrington.

390
00:34:04,133 --> 00:34:07,432
- First, the dinner last night was wonderful.
- Thank you, Mrs. Carrington.

391
00:34:07,536 --> 00:34:10,004
I was looking over the rest
of the menus for the week.

392
00:34:10,105 --> 00:34:12,232
Is there something
you don't like?

393
00:34:12,341 --> 00:34:14,366
Oh, no,
not that I don't like it.

394
00:34:14,476 --> 00:34:18,412
It's just that I think that duck
is a little heavy this time of the year.

395
00:34:18,514 --> 00:34:21,244
Well, the fact is,Joseph has always
had me prepare duckling...

396
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:23,250
on the first Friday of each month.

397
00:34:23,352 --> 00:34:28,187
Of course, we could substitute squab,
if you would prefer squab.

398
00:34:34,062 --> 00:34:36,257
Yes, I would.

399
00:34:37,933 --> 00:34:41,460
- Settled, then?
- Yes, thank you.

400
00:34:42,905 --> 00:34:45,305
Good evening, darling.
What are you doing in here?

401
00:34:45,407 --> 00:34:47,841
We were just substituting
one favorite for another.

402
00:34:49,745 --> 00:34:51,679
- No problem, Mr. Carrington.
- <i>O</i>h,J<i>o</i>s<i>e</i>ph?

403
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:53,145
Yes, sir.

404
00:34:53,248 --> 00:34:56,809
We're having a party here next
Saturday night. Prepare dinner for 1 0.

405
00:34:56,919 --> 00:34:59,012
Yes, Mr. Carrington.

406
00:34:59,121 --> 00:35:01,715
I'm afraid you're not going to like this
any more than I do.

407
00:35:01,824 --> 00:35:05,089
But it's business, and it's important.

408
00:35:05,194 --> 00:35:10,257
I've invited Walter Lankershim.
And Matthew Blaisdel and his wife.

409
00:35:47,102 --> 00:35:51,664
- Can I drop you off somewhere?
- No. I have a date.

410
00:35:51,773 --> 00:35:54,071
MasterJeffrey again?

411
00:35:55,844 --> 00:35:58,404
You're warm.

412
00:35:58,514 --> 00:36:01,711
Well, what about us?

413
00:36:01,817 --> 00:36:07,722
We've been known to be pretty warm
on... quite a few occasions.

414
00:36:07,823 --> 00:36:11,520
- Are you gonna let me go?
- I asked you something.

415
00:36:11,627 --> 00:36:14,892
I'm late. Now let go of me.

416
00:36:20,269 --> 00:36:22,863
One of these days, lady,
you're gonna want me.

417
00:36:26,742 --> 00:36:28,710
I'm not gonna be here.

418
00:36:41,089 --> 00:36:45,753
Good evening, Mrs. Carrington.
And how has your day been?

419
00:36:45,861 --> 00:36:48,989
That good, huh? Come on now.

420
00:36:49,097 --> 00:36:50,997
Don't you think we ought
to talk about this?

421
00:36:51,099 --> 00:36:53,693
What is it?
This morning, with Steven?

422
00:36:53,802 --> 00:36:57,795
I know I was rude to you, but
my kids are-- Well, they're not easy.

423
00:36:57,906 --> 00:37:00,466
- It's frustrating.
- It's not only Steven.

424
00:37:00,576 --> 00:37:02,669
- What is it then? The party?
- It's not the party.

425
00:37:02,778 --> 00:37:05,804
Joseph will take care of the party
just likeJoseph takes care of everything.

426
00:37:05,914 --> 00:37:08,109
Come on, now.
What is it? Let's talk about it.

427
00:37:09,551 --> 00:37:12,418
Are you really inviting
Matthew Blaisdel to this house?

428
00:37:12,521 --> 00:37:15,581
Yes, I am.

429
00:37:15,691 --> 00:37:19,457
Everybody who's coming to the party
knows about Matthew and me.

430
00:37:19,561 --> 00:37:21,825
Are you that intent
on embarrassing me?

431
00:37:21,930 --> 00:37:25,627
I told you that it was important to me
to have Matthew come here.

432
00:37:25,734 --> 00:37:28,828
Important to you. To you.

433
00:37:30,839 --> 00:37:34,002
The children are yours. The house
is yours. The servants are yours.

434
00:37:34,109 --> 00:37:37,374
The servants?
Now what is this about the servants?

435
00:37:40,449 --> 00:37:43,543
- Nothing. Never mind.
- Well, come on now, what about them?

436
00:37:43,652 --> 00:37:47,713
Oh, Blake. It's not important.
It's just that everything's so new.

437
00:37:47,823 --> 00:37:50,348
Now, what about the servants?

438
00:37:52,728 --> 00:37:56,664
It sounds stupid, but it hurts when you can't
get a maid to serve you on the terrace.

439
00:37:56,765 --> 00:37:59,893
Wh<i>en I</i> f<i>ol</i>d <i>m</i>y <i>o</i>w<i>n clot</i>h<i>e</i>s,
a<i>n</i>d a<i>not</i>h<i>er m</i>a<i>i</i>d <i>i</i>s <i>o</i>ff<i>en</i>d<i>e</i>d.

440
00:38:00,002 --> 00:38:04,871
The chef has menus that are carved in stone,
and when I ask about them, he puts me off.

441
00:38:04,973 --> 00:38:07,567
I can't get the gardener to put flowers
in the bedroom without an order...

442
00:38:07,676 --> 00:38:11,772
- f<i>rom</i> y<i>o</i>u <i>in tri</i>p<i>lic</i>a<i>te</i>.
- Well, why didn't you tell me about all this?

443
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:15,247
Because you have problems, and I didn't
want to bother you with nonsense.

444
00:38:15,350 --> 00:38:17,614
And that's what it is.
It's nonsense.

445
00:38:17,719 --> 00:38:20,552
I should be able to
handle it. But I can't.

446
00:38:20,656 --> 00:38:23,352
I don't know what to do
or what not to do.

447
00:38:26,028 --> 00:38:29,088
You want to know
the truth?

448
00:38:29,197 --> 00:38:31,722
I'd feel more comfortable here
as one of the staff.

449
00:38:40,075 --> 00:38:44,637
Joseph. Assemble the staff.
Yes, now!

450
00:38:58,527 --> 00:39:03,157
<i>Goo</i>d <i>o</i>f y<i>o</i>u <i>to come</i>.
<i>I t</i>h<i>o</i>ugh<i>t</i> a<i>ll o</i>f y<i>o</i>u k<i>ne</i>w <i>m</i>y w<i>i</i>f<i>e</i>.

451
00:39:03,265 --> 00:39:07,964
Apparently that was an oversight, and I'll
rectify that by making proper introductions.

452
00:39:08,070 --> 00:39:11,369
To begin with, this is
Mrs. Blake Carrington.

453
00:39:11,473 --> 00:39:15,375
My wife.
And the mistress of this house.

454
00:39:15,477 --> 00:39:18,241
Blake, please. I don't want
to go through with this.

455
00:39:18,346 --> 00:39:21,804
This is Michael.
He's ambitious.

456
00:39:21,917 --> 00:39:24,943
He listens in on conversations
which do not concern him.

457
00:39:25,053 --> 00:39:28,750
But he drives well.
And he might last the year out.

458
00:39:30,726 --> 00:39:35,891
Gerald pads the grocery bills.
Jeanette forgets instructions.

459
00:39:37,399 --> 00:39:41,733
Mrs. Gunnerson's several relatives
eat well at my expense.

460
00:39:41,837 --> 00:39:47,434
H<i>o</i>w<i>e</i>v<i>er, t</i>h<i>e</i>y a<i>ll</i> d<i>o</i> g<i>oo</i>d w<i>or</i>k, a<i>n</i>d <i>t</i>ha<i>t</i>

461
00:39:47,542 --> 00:39:51,603
- Blake, please. Could we stop?
- My wife is concerned for you.

462
00:39:51,713 --> 00:39:54,181
Now is there anyone here
that's uncomfortable?

463
00:40:03,291 --> 00:40:04,326
<i>Goo</i>d. <i>Goo</i>d.
Th<i>en I</i>'<i>ll</i> g<i>o on</i>.

464
00:40:04,326 --> 00:40:06,123
<i>Goo</i>d. <i>Goo</i>d.
Th<i>en I</i>'<i>ll</i> g<i>o on</i>.

465
00:40:07,429 --> 00:40:09,522
Leon, how long have
you been with me?

466
00:40:09,631 --> 00:40:11,724
- Ten years, sir.
- Working my gardens.

467
00:40:11,833 --> 00:40:14,529
The man in charge of all the other labor
we bring in to help you.

468
00:40:14,636 --> 00:40:16,536
Yes.

469
00:40:16,638 --> 00:40:20,631
And did you recently have a conversation
with my wife about flowers?

470
00:40:20,742 --> 00:40:23,643
Uh, I think so, yes.

471
00:40:23,745 --> 00:40:26,475
And did she ask you
in the course of that conversation...

472
00:40:26,581 --> 00:40:28,549
to place some flowers
in our bedroom?

473
00:40:28,650 --> 00:40:30,880
Uh, that's right, she did.

474
00:40:30,986 --> 00:40:34,285
And did you tell her that I do not like
flowers in my bedroom?

475
00:40:34,389 --> 00:40:37,790
Yes, you've always said
that you don't.

476
00:40:37,893 --> 00:40:43,456
Mrs. Carrington loves
flowers in her room. I do not.

477
00:40:43,565 --> 00:40:48,468
But I'll get used to that.
What I'll not get used to is rudeness.

478
00:40:50,071 --> 00:40:52,904
So pack your bags.
I want you out of here in the morning.

479
00:40:57,846 --> 00:41:00,838
Th<i>e re</i>s<i>t o</i>f y<i>o</i>u w<i>ill</i> u<i>n</i>d<i>er</i>s<i>t</i>a<i>n</i>d <i>t</i>ha<i>t</i>
wha<i>t I</i>'v<i>e trie</i>d <i>to con</i>v<i>e</i>y...

480
00:41:00,949 --> 00:41:05,352
is that you are all
dispensable to me.

481
00:41:05,453 --> 00:41:08,718
My wife is not.

482
00:41:26,541 --> 00:41:28,475
<i>(</i> Sighs <i>)</i>
How could you do that?

483
00:41:28,577 --> 00:41:31,478
- I know that you're feeling a little--
- I didn't want that man fired.

484
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:33,912
- That was the last thing I wanted.
- Tomorrow morning...

485
00:41:34,015 --> 00:41:37,280
Joseph will come to me and
say that Leon has apologized...

486
00:41:37,385 --> 00:41:39,285
and would like to have
his job back.

487
00:41:39,387 --> 00:41:41,378
And I will give him
his job back.

488
00:41:41,489 --> 00:41:43,548
And the others will all say:

489
00:41:43,658 --> 00:41:47,958
""That Mr. Carrington is
a hard man, but a fair man.''

490
00:41:48,063 --> 00:41:52,523
Krystle, I can't expect you to
know about all this right away.

491
00:41:52,634 --> 00:41:54,761
About how this house is run.

492
00:41:54,870 --> 00:41:58,533
About who comes to this house
as guests and why.

493
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:03,077
But I will teach you.
And you will learn.

494
00:42:05,914 --> 00:42:09,077
Come on. Let's go to bed.

495
00:42:18,827 --> 00:42:18,927
If I hadn't called you, Cecil, I guess
I never would have heard from you again.

496
00:42:18,927 --> 00:42:22,954
If I hadn't called you, Cecil, I guess
I never would have heard from you again.

497
00:42:23,064 --> 00:42:28,832
No, probably not. You were
a momentary indulgence, Fallon.

498
00:42:28,937 --> 00:42:31,997
You see, I really prefer
slightly more mature women.

499
00:42:32,107 --> 00:42:36,669
Oh. Well, I've decided that it's time
to put away childish things.

500
00:42:36,778 --> 00:42:40,612
Which makes me, ergo,
available.

501
00:42:40,715 --> 00:42:43,275
And?

502
00:42:45,854 --> 00:42:48,823
And?

503
00:43:03,204 --> 00:43:06,970
Fallon, if we were going
to proceed with this...

504
00:43:07,075 --> 00:43:12,411
I'd have whisked you off somewhere
less damp, more intimate.

505
00:43:14,849 --> 00:43:17,647
But, you see,
this is a sort of...

506
00:43:17,752 --> 00:43:21,449
out-in-the-open business meeting
between the two of us.

507
00:43:23,491 --> 00:43:28,986
Your father is in deep trouble.
You want me to help him.

508
00:43:29,097 --> 00:43:32,430
I never said that.

509
00:43:32,534 --> 00:43:35,230
There's a half-Oklahoma,
half Walton-on-Thames...

510
00:43:35,337 --> 00:43:37,464
gypsy streak in me
that reads minds.

511
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:43,077
Just as you are
reading mine right now.

512
00:43:43,178 --> 00:43:46,079
- Am I?
- I believe so.

513
00:43:52,787 --> 00:43:57,190
I want you to marryJeff.

514
00:44:02,497 --> 00:44:06,399
You know something?
I'd rather marry you.

515
00:44:09,904 --> 00:44:12,031
That's very sweet.

516
00:44:14,409 --> 00:44:18,869
But each of us is here for a reason beyond
what we really want for ourselves.

517
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:21,949
Yours being your nephew.

518
00:44:22,050 --> 00:44:24,348
He adores you.

519
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:29,651
I want him to settle down
with someone smart, even brilliant.

520
00:44:29,758 --> 00:44:33,660
You. As for the wedding
gift, what I have--

521
00:44:33,762 --> 00:44:36,663
- Aren't you rushing this a little?
- I don't think so.

522
00:44:38,099 --> 00:44:40,363
You'll bail out my father.

523
00:44:40,468 --> 00:44:43,801
Exactly.

524
00:44:43,905 --> 00:44:47,739
You can't not likeJeff.
He's bright enough. He's good-looking.

525
00:44:47,842 --> 00:44:50,572
Caring. Quite a catch,
some would say.

526
00:44:50,678 --> 00:44:53,704
Sort of a Denver version
Prince of Wales.

527
00:44:53,815 --> 00:44:56,079
Cecil, when I marry,
what I want...

528
00:44:56,184 --> 00:45:00,052
is to lie beside
a man who excites me.

529
00:45:00,155 --> 00:45:02,123
And I have.

530
00:45:03,825 --> 00:45:06,589
You listen to me, my dear.

531
00:45:06,694 --> 00:45:10,357
Passion dies.
Power remains.

532
00:45:12,233 --> 00:45:16,067
There are very few young men in this world
who'll be as powerful as Jeff Colby.

533
00:45:16,171 --> 00:45:19,868
If he gets direction...

534
00:45:19,974 --> 00:45:22,465
to direct his drive.

535
00:45:22,577 --> 00:45:26,638
It's there. It just needs
guidance, stirring up.

536
00:45:26,748 --> 00:45:30,514
Stimulation--
that's the word.

537
00:45:30,618 --> 00:45:33,485
Something I obviously
have been unable to provide.

538
00:45:37,358 --> 00:45:41,658
Fa<i>llon, mo</i>s<i>t im</i>p<i>o</i>rta<i>nt</i>
<i>to</i> y<i>o</i>u <i>i</i>s <i>Bl</i>ak<i>e</i>.

539
00:45:41,763 --> 00:45:44,323
I know that.

540
00:45:44,432 --> 00:45:48,596
Just as we both know that I'm the one
who can help him most.

541
00:45:50,305 --> 00:45:54,173
- When?
- Immediately.

542
00:45:54,275 --> 00:45:58,803
- He'll find out.
- No, he won't. Nor willJeff.

543
00:46:12,393 --> 00:46:15,487
What if I change my mind,
and I don't keep my end of the bargain?

544
00:46:17,232 --> 00:46:20,201
Let's just say that,
at my age...

545
00:46:20,301 --> 00:46:23,270
vengeance is
as sweet as sex.

546
00:46:37,685 --> 00:46:39,653
Well, what do you say?

547
00:46:41,222 --> 00:46:43,190
Do we have a deal?

548
00:47:15,557 --> 00:47:17,184
