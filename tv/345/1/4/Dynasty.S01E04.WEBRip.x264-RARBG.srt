[narrator]  Previously on  Dynasty:

2
00:00:13,763 --> 00:00:17,684
That is no way to talk to your new boss.
He offered me the COO position.

3
00:00:17,767 --> 00:00:20,729
[Fallon] With Jeff's backing,
I'll be chief executive officer

4
00:00:20,812 --> 00:00:23,231
of Carrington Windbriar,
your competition.

5
00:00:23,314 --> 00:00:25,400
Matthew coming by, was that a test?

6
00:00:25,483 --> 00:00:27,068
[man] Someone spotted you two.

7
00:00:27,152 --> 00:00:30,447
-There was a malfunction.
-The issue is murder.

8
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:32,157
Are you gonna honor the dead or yourself?

9
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:36,202
Wife, mistress, widow?
Or will you leave Claudia that scrap?

10
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:38,079
[officer] You have the right
to remain silent.

11
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:41,291
-[Blake] He's accusing you of murder.
-I had nothing to do with Matthew's death.

12
00:00:41,374 --> 00:00:44,169
I can't tell him
that my entire past is a lie.

13
00:00:44,252 --> 00:00:46,546
-Who would do this to you?
-Hey.

14
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:49,716
-[Sammy Jo] I got the money.
-[Crystal] What'd you do?

15
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:52,051
-Who do you think set up the robbery?
-It's missing.

16
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:56,347
If what's on that phone gets out...
it will ruin the Carrington name.

A murder charge will do that to you.

This is supposed to cheer you up.

Well, if they can get you off.
Innuendo unintended.

32
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:43,019
Without an alibi to prove
I didn't kill Matthew,

33
00:01:43,102 --> 00:01:45,814
the FBI are saying we need
to provide a suspect.

I'm not gonna let them

But why not? Daddy would.

00:01:50,026 --> 00:01:52,612
As juvenile as it sounds,
I wish Mom were here.

37
00:01:52,695 --> 00:01:57,200
Why? The only thing she's good for
is the birthday card her secretary writes.

38
00:01:57,283 --> 00:02:00,870
-She spelled your name wrong.
-Lots of people think it's P-H.

39
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:05,333
-I just wish I could ask her advice.
-Hey, the best thing Mom ever taught us

40
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:07,418
is what we learned when she left.

45

Don't forget to pack the silver.

46
00:02:27,897 --> 00:02:29,816
Thanks for the bags, Anders.

47
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:34,571
Where are you going?

48
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:37,073
Away.

49
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:41,077
-Done with the Carringtons so soon?
-I'm just about done with you.

50
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:45,290
I'm not over the fact
that you staged a robbery in my home.

51
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:46,291
It'll be fine.

52
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:49,836
My mom's got her money,
and you can get a less tacky ring,

53
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:52,171
something that doesn't belong
in a gumball machine.

54
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:54,757
Right now,
Blake is meeting with Stansfield.

55
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:59,512
If the cops find out it was your friends,
that you were involved, that I'm lying...

56
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:02,390
-Add it to the list.
-This is different.

57
00:03:02,473 --> 00:03:04,601
You pick and choose your lies
like you do your men.

58
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:08,771
Okay, enough. All I've done
is jump from one crisis to the next.

59
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:12,275
Matthew, a murder investigation,
now my nephew's felony.

60
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:14,068
It's no way to start a marriage.

61
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:17,363
-So, you're running away?
-I'm going on my honeymoon.

62
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:18,615
Wow.

63
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:20,158
Why pack anything at all?

64
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:24,370
Yeah, put that away. I don't need
to see how Blake's sausage is made.

65
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:28,625
Fine, go. This whole thing will blow over
before you get back.

66
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,168
For your sake, I hope so.

67
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:33,922
And Anders is sniffing around,
so you need to lay low.

68
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:34,923
I always do.

69
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:37,175
If the diamond was registered,

70
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:40,178
-we have hope of tracing it.
-Forget about the ring.

71
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:42,597
That's what insurance is for.
I need that phone.

72
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:45,725
If anybody finds out I had it
or what's on it,

73
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:49,646
-the FBI will be all over me.
-They're busy investigating your son.

74
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:51,773
-Who thinks I gave it to you.
-You told him?

75
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:53,775
He knew something was going on.

76
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:59,906
And if he finds out I lied... I'm not
the only one with something to lose here.

77
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:04,077
If anybody finds out I had that phone,
they'll ask where I got it from.

78
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,995
If they find out you stole it--

79
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:10,458
The entire Robbery division is on this,
working around the clock.

80
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:14,337
I don't care what you do.
Find the people who took that phone

81
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:18,466
before they realize what they have.
It's not just for my sake or yours.

82
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:20,843
My family's, too.

83
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:28,935
-Can I help you?
-Just looking for the bathroom.

84
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:32,105
-It's easy to get lost in this place.
-Not easy enough.

85
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:37,568
Sorry I'm late.
I thought I'd squeeze in a morning ride.

86
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:39,904
-Mm. Anyone I know?
-[Fallon scoffs]

87
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:42,282
A warmblood Palomino
named Butterscotch.

88
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:45,285
He was a gift for my 16th birthday
from Daddy.

89
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:48,788
Speaking of, what happened to the dirt
you were looking for?

90
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:52,083
-Nothing from the driver?
-Don't worry about the lawsuit.

91
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:55,753
-Your dad's gonna drop it?
-No. We are.

92
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:57,797
We don't need the Carrington name.

93
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:01,801
This company represents a new start
and we need a new name. My name.

94
00:05:01,884 --> 00:05:05,596
-So, what, like Fallon Co.?
-Pfft. This isn't amateur hour.

95
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:10,226
"Morell Green Energy Corporation"?

96
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:13,980
My middle name. A reminder
that I can only count on myself.

97
00:05:14,063 --> 00:05:17,317
-What about the guy backing you?
-You're backing me.

98
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,945
I'm the one who needs to prove my value,
and I know how.

99
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:24,866
The city utility contract is up
for renewal. It's worth a billion.

100
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:29,579
You wanna poach the city of Atlanta?
Hasn't CA had that contract for 60 years?

101
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:32,332
Imagine the headline.
"The Home of Carrington Atlantic

102
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:34,334
-Powered by Morell Corp."
-That's ambitious.

103
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:36,461
You don't hit a home run
without a big swing.

104
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:37,754
This would put us on the map.

105
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:40,673
It would show people clean energy
could scale up.

106
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:43,801
-And screw over your dad.
-[chuckles] It's a win-win.

107
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:46,596
His new COO can pick up the pieces.

108
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:50,433
-How exactly are we gonna pull this off?
-Oh, not we. Me.

109
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:53,311
Pfeiffer runs point on these
at the city council.

110
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:55,730
He and I got back to my CA days.
He loves me.

111
00:05:55,813 --> 00:05:59,859
-Enough to cross Blake Carrington?
-Please. He'd leave his wife for me.

112
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:02,653
And his sidepiece.
Not that I'm offering.

113
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:05,698
It won't take much
to get him eating out of my hand.

114
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:11,412
[Blake] Hey, sweetheart.
Anders said you wanted to see me?

115
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:12,872
What's going on?

116
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:15,958
With everything that happened,
we missed Bora-Bora.

117
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:19,754
So, plan B, I've taken care
of the arrangements

118
00:06:19,837 --> 00:06:23,508
and packed you a suitcase.
I'm even handling the transportation.

119
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:26,427
-Where are we going?
-It's a surprise.

120
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:29,388
But I can give you a preview
of the itinerary.

121
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:32,225
Oh. [chuckles]

122
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:35,144
There's just so much going on here.

123
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:40,108
Got Steven's charges,
and now the robbery.

124
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:45,363
-It's not the best time to go away.
-After this weekend, we go back to work.

125
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:49,075
If we don't go now, we will be
celebrating our first anniversary

126
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:51,285
before we take our honeymoon.

127
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:52,411
I don't know.

128
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:57,250
You're not Steven's lawyer, you've told
Stansfield about the robbery,

129
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:59,418
and will only be a phone call away.

130
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:02,505
-You make a very firm point.
-Mm-hm.

131
00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:07,552
[Sammy Jo] So, when you robbed the place,
did you find some kind of cell phone?

132
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:11,222
-I was wondering when you'd come for it.
-You have it?

133
00:07:11,305 --> 00:07:15,143
Yeah. It was in one of the drawers.
I was just grabbing things,

134
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:17,478
figured we'd look through it
when it was time to sell.

135
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:20,106
-Wait, you didn't sell it, did you?
-Not yet.

136
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:22,900
Relax, man. I'm gonna cut you in.

137
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:26,154
No, no, man, I don't need a cut.
I need the phone.

138
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:30,366
They're looking for it and for you.
They'll stop if they have it back.

139
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:33,536
I'll give you cash. It can't be worth
more than a couple hundred.

140
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:37,165
You mean a couple hundred grand, right?
I saw the video, man.

141
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:40,334
Since it is your aunt,
I'll even give you a bit extra.

142
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:41,419
What video?

143
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:45,965
The one with your aunt and the dead guy.

144
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:50,636
I didn't realize they knew each other
that well... or that she was so hot.

145
00:07:51,345 --> 00:07:55,892
-A sex tape? You can't sell that.
-Are you kidding me?

146
00:07:55,975 --> 00:08:00,313
That's Kardashian-level filmmaking.
We're gonna have a bidding war for it.

147
00:08:00,396 --> 00:08:03,774
Unless the Carringtons wanna pay
fair market value.

148
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:06,235
I got you a payday. You're getting greedy.

149
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,238
Man, that's easy to say
when you're living in their mansion.

150
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:12,867
-Give me the phone.
-Get my money by 5.

151
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:38,726
[Sammy Jo] There you are.
Been trying Cristal. She's not picking up.

152
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:40,353
Whoa, slow down. What happened?

153
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:43,272
Remember when I told you
I have some... sketchy friends?

154
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,525
"Stupid kids' stuff," I think you said.

155
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:50,071
Well, it was one of those stupid kids
who bling-ringed your house.

156
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:52,365
-What? Did you know?
-No.

157
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:56,702
I told them about the gala,
but I thought he was coming for the food.

158
00:08:56,786 --> 00:09:00,957
Oh. And the jewelry. Sounds like
a great friend. I'll call Stansfield.

159
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,834
No, no, no. Listen.
It wasn't just jewelry.

160
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:07,505
There was a phone in your dad's room,
Matthew's phone,

161
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:12,260
-with video of him and my aunt.
-He told me he gave that phone back.

162
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:14,470
We need to come up with 200,000,

163
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:18,099
or my aunt's sex tape
will be all over the Internet.

164
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:21,394
Cristal didn't do anything,
and she's gonna get hurt.

165
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:26,607
[woman on recording]  You have reached
the cell phone of Blake Carrington.

166
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:31,654
-I don't even know where my dad is.
-Well... what would he do?

167
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:37,076
[Blake] The hunting cabin?

168
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,372
I can't believe you chose this place.

169
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:47,128
Of all the Carrington properties,
this seemed the most low-key.

170
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:51,591
-I'm surprised you didn't figure it out.
-Oh. I've always come in by helicopter.

171
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:55,928
Well, just so you know, we won't be
killing any animals on this trip.

172
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:58,180
I thought it'd be nice
to get out of the city,

173
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:01,809
just you and me and these trees.

174
00:10:01,892 --> 00:10:03,811
And not one of them a cell tower.

175
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:07,148
If you're good,
I might let you get on the Wi-Fi.

176
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:11,152
There is no Wi-Fi. My grandfather
built this to get away from it all.

177
00:10:11,235 --> 00:10:15,031
-We never put in Internet.
-Even better. More time for us.

178
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:26,250
No wonder people choose
the private sector.

179
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:29,712
-[woman] Fallon?
-Oh. Thank God. There's no receptionist.

180
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:31,547
Kori Rucks.
I work with Councilman Pfeiffer.

181
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:34,091
You wouldn't happen to have
a real cup of coffee, would you?

182
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:37,678
Oh, that's a little too real.

183
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:42,391
Sorry, I don't work for Chris.
I'm on the council, District Ten.

184
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:45,061
You're here to discuss
the utility contracts?

185
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:47,563
Yes, I know Pfeiffer
is in charge of that.

186
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:52,068
Actually, I'm taking over. So,
if you're here to talk energy, let's talk.

187
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:54,236
[Kori chuckles]

188
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:07,625
-Anders. Join me for a time trial.
-That would require sweat.

189
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:08,668
[chuckles]

190
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:11,712
Come on, man.
Blake is out of town for the weekend.

191
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:14,507
You could lose a button or two.
Live a little.

192
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:20,304
As you know, Mister Carrington's
very upset about this robbery.

193
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:22,807
I could imagine. There's a pretty nasty
bump on his head.

194
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:26,769
Finding out who's responsible
is a high priority for him and for me.

195
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:30,940
If you saw anything, anything
that you thought might be a bit amiss...

196
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:33,359
Like I told the cops, I wasn't watching.

197
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:38,072
I imagine you had your head
in other matters... like Miss Carrington?

198
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:41,575
I take it she didn't see much either.

199
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:45,454
-You'll have to ask Miss Carrington.
-Very well.

200
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:51,836
But if you should think of something
or hear anything, let me know.

201
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:56,507
I don't have to remind you,
this incident doesn't reflect well

202
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:59,760
-on those of us employed here.
-What does that mean?

203
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:03,139
It's just that we all have a stake
in putting this to bed,

204
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:06,934
especially those of us with families
that depend on our salaries.

205
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,522
Anything specific
I should be listening out for?

206
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:15,401
Yes, the personal things,
Mrs. Carrington's ring, some watches

207
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:19,238
and a phone are of particular value
to Mr. Carrington.

208
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:22,700
All right,
I'll keep my ear to the ground.

209
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:25,202
And your mouth off Fallon.

210
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:31,125
Morell Corp. represents
the next generation of energy,

211
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:35,212
and Atlanta has the chance to become
a national model for a green city.

212
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:39,508
We plan to take clean power, spread it,
take it national and then beyond.

213
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,802
-So, Atlanta's just the first step?
-Exactly.

214
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:43,179
Hmm.

215
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:47,766
I wish you the best of luck
with your new company,

216
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:50,561
but Atlanta is not a means to an end.

217
00:12:50,644 --> 00:12:53,981
This is my home, my city,
and now my responsibility.

218
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:56,108
Not some pawn
in the Carrington family feud.

219
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:58,527
I understand the connotations
with the Carrington name.

220
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:03,032
-Morell Corp. is a different company.
-Whatever you call it, you're still you,

221
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:06,160
and you haven't changed
since high school.

222
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:11,165
You went to Penley.
Oh, my God. [chuckles]

223
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:14,793
Of course. Kori, you look so different.
Did you change your hair?

224
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:16,378
Come on, Fallon.

225
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:20,674
You can't expect me to buy
this "new year, new me" bit. Can you?

226
00:13:22,426 --> 00:13:26,555
Maybe you can. You seem to have
the whole world bowing at your feet.

227
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:30,017
I'm sure you'll be fine without Atlanta.

228
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:33,646
See you at the ten-year reunion.

229
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:40,694
-I didn't know who to call.
-You did the right thing.

230
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:42,738
[Steven] This guy is a friend of Sam's.

231
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:46,033
I don't know
if you can call that a friend,

232
00:13:46,116 --> 00:13:48,577
but he used Sam to get into the house.

233
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:51,080
And he has the phone
with this video on it?

234
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:54,750
He's trying to extort my father,
but Dad is MIA and we don't have time.

235
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:57,836
-How much does this guy want?
-Two hundred thousand.

236
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,965
What if I get the phone back
and he's copied the video?

237
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:04,343
Right. Why settle for one payday
if you can have two?

238
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:06,720
And, uh, the nephew?

239
00:14:07,888 --> 00:14:10,182
Sam didn't have anything
to do with this.

240
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:12,518
He's tied up with some bad people.

241
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:16,647
The best shot at stopping this
is putting cuffs on both of them.

242
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:21,610
Arresting Blake Carrington's new nephew
would only invite questions.

243
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:27,324
Questions you don't want, since
you stole the phone first from evidence.

244
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:29,702
Look, I just want all this to be over.

245
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:33,289
I'll go in and buy the phone,
you come in and get this guy.

246
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:37,918
Silver spoon's first sting.
Your dad would be proud.

247
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:41,547
Let's just call this what it is.

248
00:14:42,631 --> 00:14:45,259
This is you
cleaning up your own corruption.

249
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:49,263
You tampered with a murder investigation.
You should've been figuring out who did it

250
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:51,348
so I don't go to prison
for a crime I didn't commit.

251
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:53,893
-What exactly do you want me to do?
-Do your job.

252
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:57,062
Find out who really killed Matthew.
Make it right.

253
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:08,991
-[Jeff] How could you not remember Kori?
-Well, I do now.

254
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:11,785
Didn't she have some
Hello Kitty obsession?

255
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:15,247
You still don't. I should've
been your wingman after all.

256
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:19,752
Glad you find this funny, but I'm not
losing this contract over hurt feelings.

257
00:15:19,835 --> 00:15:22,463
You really think
it's just about high school?

258
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:24,798
-Obviously.
-Why don't you let me try?

259
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:27,009
Maybe I can smooth things over.

260
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:29,511
Remind Kori that
you're not the whole company.

261
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:32,973
-Kori Rucks?
-Seriously? You, too?

262
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:36,727
Fallon had a meeting with her,
didn't know who she was.

263
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:39,563
-I might've asked her to get me a coffee.
-[both] What?

264
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:41,649
I thought she was an assistant.
I'm fixing it.

265
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:44,735
No, actually, I am. I'm gonna call her.

266
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:48,197
Good luck with that.
Kori does not roll over easily.

267
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,616
Present tense? You're still friends?

268
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:53,327
Yeah, we went to MJQ last weekend.
I invited you.

269
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:57,498
-Do you listen to anything I say?
-Don't take it personally.

270
00:15:57,581 --> 00:15:59,917
Monica, what if you invited her out

271
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,837
and I just happened to be there?
She might be a bit more receptive?

272
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:06,256
Well, I'm the one who knows energy.

273
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:10,844
Yeah, let me butter her up, okay?
Set the stage, then you come in.

274
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:14,223
And do the heavy lifting.
Not that your part isn't heavy.

275
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:19,895
I gotta say, I do not mind
not having an office yet.

276
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,397
We swimming or what?

277
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:30,239
The Carringtons came through.

278
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:33,534
Two hundred thousand. It's all here.
Where's the phone?

279
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:40,582
How do I know that's it?
Show me the contacts or something.

280
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:44,920
Okay, turn it off.

281
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:52,386
-You swear this is the only copy?
-Even I have a code, okay? Deal's a deal.

282
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:55,514
-Don't spend it all in one place.
-Back at you.

283
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:58,225
I'm sure Carrington's errand boy
pays well.

284
00:16:58,308 --> 00:17:01,311
You're the one with 200 grand now.
I'm Robin Hood.

285
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:04,940
-Everything okay?
-Got it.

286
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:08,736
-And the video?
-He swears it's the only copy.

287
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:10,195
Do you believe him?

288
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:13,282
Look, screwed up as it sounds,
he's not a bad dude.

289
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:17,077
Why are you freaking out?
I got it. We're good.

290
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:20,414
Yeah, he can go in.

291
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:24,460
Yeah, I'll get you the phone
after you get my 200 grand back.

292
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:26,754
-Who was that?
-Stansfield.

293
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:28,338
What?

294
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:31,592
You didn't say anything about cops.

295
00:17:31,675 --> 00:17:34,261
Don't worry. I told him
you didn't have anything to do with it.

296
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:37,973
Hey, if anything, you were the one
that solved it. Let's get out of here.

297
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,394
[officer] Go, go, go!

298
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:48,484
So, I know I said no dead animals,
but since this one's already here...

299
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:54,948
I thought I'd slip into something
a little more comfortable.

300
00:17:57,993 --> 00:17:58,952
Blake?

301
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:06,460
-[Blake sighs] Damn it.
-What are you doing?

302
00:18:06,543 --> 00:18:10,339
I missed a call from the office.
My phone won't even ring out here.

303
00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:13,217
Can't call him back.
I can't get voicemail.

304
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,094
So, I'm standing here naked,

305
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:18,055
wrapped in an animal that probably died
before I was born,

306
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:20,140
-and you're calling the office?
-If you had told me

307
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:22,559
we'd be off the grid,
I would've planned things differently.

308
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:24,853
I thought this surprise would be romantic.

309
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:27,773
These are the first few days we've had
just to be husband and wife

310
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:31,110
and it might be the last ones we have
for a while.

311
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:33,862
I just wanna enjoy them. Don't you?

312
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:37,157
-Of course I do.
-Good.

313
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:39,952
If I remember correctly,
there's a waterfall...

314
00:18:40,035 --> 00:18:42,121
-[gasps]
-...a couple of miles from here.

315
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:44,957
It's not a hot tub,
but you can't beat it for stargazing.

316
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,625
-[squeals]
-Up for an adventure?

317
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:50,838
-Always. I'll go change.
-No. One minute.

318
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:57,302
Can we try for two?

319
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:00,597
Why didn't you tell me
you had gone to Stansfield?

320
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:04,101
What kind of a friend robs your aunt,
then tries to blackmail her?

321
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:07,354
-I'm not saying what he did was okay.
-It was illegal.

322
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:08,981
Have you ever broken a law?

323
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:12,901
-I've never extorted anyone.
-Because you haven't had to.

324
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:16,572
You don't know what it is like
to worry about making rent

325
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:19,283
or what you'll do
if your car breaks down.

326
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:22,077
Are you suggesting we should've
let him get away with it?

327
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,621
Taken him at his word
that he's gonna stick to the deal?

328
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:26,957
-He's a criminal.
-Why didn't you tell me your plan?

329
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:30,252
I didn't wanna make you lie.
I was trying to protect you.

330
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:32,004
And who does that sound like?

331
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:34,631
I thought you were the different one,

332
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:37,467
but now I see the family resemblance,
Mr. Carrington.

333
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:43,098
-You got two seconds for me?
-[sighs] I'm already late. Wait.

334
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:47,144
What does this dress say? Bold, demure,
loud enough to command a room

335
00:19:47,227 --> 00:19:49,855
yet still whisper top of the class
at Wharton?

336
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:53,233
-Is that...?
-Matthew's phone.

337
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:57,321
-You took it?
-No, Sam's friend did. It's a long story.

338
00:19:57,404 --> 00:19:59,448
Dad told me he'd given this to Stansfield.

339
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:03,368
-Hmm. So, how'd you get it back?
-Sam and 200 grand.

340
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:05,829
Remember the photo
of Cristal and Matthew?

341
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:07,289
[chuckles] Yeah.

342
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:11,251
Well, there's a video on here
of them doing way more than sitting.

343
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:14,004
-Have you seen it?
-I can't unsee it.

344
00:20:14,087 --> 00:20:16,381
I don't even wanna know
why Dad had it.

345

346
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:20,552
Oh, well, at least it's grainy.

347
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:22,971
Though she almost looks hot upside down.

348
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:26,516
[Steven] I got the phone back,
and I led Stansfield to the robber.

349
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:30,062
-Wait, you helped Stansfield?
-I helped everyone.

350
00:20:30,145 --> 00:20:33,732
-Dad, Cristal, Sammy Jo.
-And what do you get?

351
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:36,735
-What do you mean?
-You're on the hook for a murder.

352
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:41,156
Negotiate. You give Stansfield the phone
and he gives you the alternate suspect.

353
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,158
As long as you're complicit
in police corruption,

354
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:45,619
-you might as well work it.
-I can't do that.

355
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:48,997
If you hand over the phone,
where does that leave you?

356
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:51,917
Back to square one. No closer
to figuring out who killed Matthew

357
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,002
-and the FBI thinks I did it.
-Yeah.

358
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:56,213
Especially if you're the last one
holding on to this.

359
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:59,174
It is a bad time
for Dad to be out of town.

360
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:02,719
What did I just tell you?
We don't need anybody but us.

is over, the sooner you can get back

00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:41,076
We're probably over here
by this ranger station.

480
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:44,996
Maybe they can help us.
I'd be willing to ask directions.

481
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:49,793
Do you seriously expect me to believe
that you accidentally led us

482
00:27:49,876 --> 00:27:52,962
straight to the ranger station?
Are you that desperate

483
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:55,840
-to check your messages?
-Told you it wasn't a good time.

484
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:58,051
-You insisted.
-You admit it?

485
00:27:58,134 --> 00:28:01,554
You did bring us here on purpose. God!

486
00:28:02,138 --> 00:28:05,809
I can't believe I thought we could have
one whole day together

487
00:28:05,892 --> 00:28:07,769
without the world pressing in.

488
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:08,853
[cell phone chiming]

489
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:10,105
Oh.

490
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:11,606
There it is.

491
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:16,653
You came all this way for service.
You might as well have a look.

492
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:20,115
Jesus.

493
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,034
[Blake] Oh, hell.

494
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:24,035
[cell phone chimes]

495
00:28:27,247 --> 00:28:29,582
Oh, my God. Did they find the robber?

496
00:28:31,584 --> 00:28:34,462
Oh, my God. What is this?

497
00:28:35,088 --> 00:28:39,134
It looks like it's you and Matthew...
all over the Internet.

498
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,851
[Cristal on screen]  Are you filming me?

499
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:49,853
[chuckles]

500
00:28:51,354 --> 00:28:52,605
[moaning]

501
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:56,985
[giggles]

502
00:28:59,112 --> 00:29:00,613
Stop, let me film you.

503
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:08,872
[reporters clamoring]

504
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:18,631
I want my lawyers here now.

505
00:29:18,715 --> 00:29:23,094
Waiting in the study, sir.
Perhaps we suggest they move in.

506
00:29:32,812 --> 00:29:35,940
-Sorry, what? Your friend did that to me?
-Ow.

507
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:38,067
How could you let this happen, Sam?

508
00:29:38,818 --> 00:29:43,239
I don't know. I guess he had a failsafe
or he lied and he had already sold it.

509
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:48,286
Sorry. Steven didn't tell me
he was gonna get the cops involved.

510
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:50,955
You told Steven about this?
About the robbery?

511
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:53,249
I had to. I didn't have the money.

512
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:56,503
I might've fudged some of the details.

513
00:29:56,586 --> 00:30:00,048
I told Steven I didn't know
they were gonna rob the house.

514
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:03,426
-That's how you didn't get arrested.
-To protect you, too.

515
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:07,347
If I told them I did it, and about my mom,
he'd ask what you knew,

516
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:09,140
and if he told Blake...

517
00:30:12,185 --> 00:30:14,854
I-- I thought I fixed it, Cristal.
I'm sorry.

518
00:30:16,564 --> 00:30:19,150
-What are they saying about me?
-Cristal.

519
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:21,611
Just rip the Band-Aid off, Sam.

520
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:27,200
"Million-dollar tramp."

521
00:30:28,284 --> 00:30:29,369
"Naked ambition."

522
00:30:31,037 --> 00:30:32,872
And, uh, this one's kind of clever.

523
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:35,166
"Private relations."

524
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:38,503
Like, they crossed out "public."

525
00:30:38,586 --> 00:30:39,712
It's charming.

526
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:42,799
I'm Atlanta's biggest slut.

527
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:45,510
I can't speak to that...

528
00:30:47,303 --> 00:30:48,763
but looks like Fallon can.

529
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:51,683
[reporter]  Fallon, can you comment
on the sex tape that surfaced?

530
00:30:51,766 --> 00:30:55,520
I know as much as you do. I can't
comment on somebody else's proclivities.

531
00:30:55,603 --> 00:30:57,438
Those are questions for the movie star.

532
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:01,609
That bitch.

533
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:04,279
[phone ringing]

534
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:08,408
-Willy?
-[Willy]  I wasn't sure you'd pick up.

535
00:31:08,491 --> 00:31:10,910
I've tried everyone.
Stansfield hung up on me.

536
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:14,080
-The FBI won't call me back.
-What's going on?

537
00:31:14,163 --> 00:31:18,543
-Seen this tape of Matthew and Cristal?
-Unfortunately. Has Claudia?

538
00:31:18,626 --> 00:31:22,213
She's seen it. I just got back
from her house. She's a mess.

539
00:31:22,797 --> 00:31:26,759
She may not be able to fight for herself,
but I'm gonna fight for her.

540
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:28,219
This tape, it's motive.

541
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:31,598
Blake didn't want his wife's
old boyfriend hanging around.

542
00:31:32,181 --> 00:31:35,560
Wait. You still think my dad
killed Matthew?

543
00:31:35,643 --> 00:31:38,021
It wasn't you. You were Matthew's friend.

544
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:41,107
Maybe the only good one left
in that house.

545
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:45,153
Where are you right now?
I'm coming to meet you.

546
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:48,865
[sighs] As I've told everyone else,
this is between my father

547
00:31:48,948 --> 00:31:52,869
and his surprisingly flexible new bride.
It's a private family matter.

548
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:55,747
About as private as a circus.

549
00:31:56,539 --> 00:31:57,582
Hey.

550
00:31:58,291 --> 00:32:02,378
-What happened to you last night?
-I came to find you and you were gone.

551
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:06,382
I had every newspaper in Atlanta
calling me about Cristal's porno.

552
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:07,342
I texted you.

553
00:32:08,217 --> 00:32:11,262
That's why you bailed on our plan,
to give interviews

554
00:32:11,346 --> 00:32:13,264
about your stepmother's sex tape?

555
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:17,018
You took your eye off the prize
to take a swipe at Cristal.

556
00:32:17,727 --> 00:32:21,230
-You really can't help yourself.
-She's not just my stepmother.

557
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:25,026
She's also the new COO of our competition
of this new deal we're trying to strike.

558
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:28,154
That's right, we.
And I was there for you, Fallon.

559
00:32:28,738 --> 00:32:31,699
I put myself on the line for a deal
you had to have,

560
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:35,161
but you made me look like an idiot
because you're only out for yourself.

561
00:32:35,244 --> 00:32:36,663
Must be genetic.

562
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:41,584
And speaking of our main competition,
congratulations.

563
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:45,004
Carrington Atlantic lost the contract.
Kori just called me.

564
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:47,840
-We got it?
-No, Southern Power did.

565
00:32:48,424 --> 00:32:53,221
The Morell Corp. presentation wasn't
concrete enough for the city council.

566
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:55,890
That was all you, remember?

567
00:32:56,683 --> 00:33:00,311
I'm guessing you didn't play team sports
as a kid,

568
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:02,814
but we're supposed to be in this together.

569
00:33:02,897 --> 00:33:06,109
You're no longer the only one
who pays for your mistakes.

570
00:33:08,611 --> 00:33:09,487
Willy?

571
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:10,989
It's Steven.

572
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:25,420
[cell phone ringing]

573
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:28,381
[cell phone ringing through door]

574
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:39,017
Hello?

575
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:52,655
-[Cristal] I just can't believe it.
-[Stansfield] Toxicology will confirm.

576
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:54,532
His death looks like a suicide.

577
00:33:54,615 --> 00:33:56,909
He had sleeping pills next to him.

578
00:33:56,993 --> 00:33:59,662
And there was a note
claiming responsibility

579
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:01,414
for the Windbriar explosion.

580
00:34:01,497 --> 00:34:06,294
That doesn't make sense.
Willy called me and I didn't see a note.

581
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:08,588
One of my detectives discovered it,

582
00:34:08,671 --> 00:34:12,633
and it seems Willy was angry
at Carrington Atlantic

583
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:15,011
for twice denying him a promotion.

584
00:34:15,094 --> 00:34:18,222
-He killed Matthew?
-Apparently, he didn't intend to.

585
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:23,061
He was trying to sabotage the operation
and damage Carrington Atlantic equipment.

586
00:34:23,144 --> 00:34:26,606
His friend Matthew was collateral damage,
it seems,

587
00:34:26,689 --> 00:34:30,860
and then seeing his name dragged
through the mud these last 24 hours,

588
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:33,112
it was too much.

589
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:36,699
-Does the FBI know about this?
-They've already been alerted.

590
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:40,203
They're confirming his story,
but it's just a formality.

591
00:34:40,286 --> 00:34:44,791
Once the toxicology comes out,
charges against you will be dropped.

592
00:34:45,374 --> 00:34:48,419
-The Horse Whisperer rides again.
-[Blake] What about Claudia?

593
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:51,672
-Has anyone spoken to her?
-We're sending someone over.

594
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:54,717
-Oh, my God.
-It's not how we expected this to end,

595
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:58,971
but at least she'll finally
have some closure.

596
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:02,266
[Steven] Hey.

597
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:08,981
-I don't understand.
-It's been a rough day, hasn't it?

598
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:14,195
While I'm here,
I believe you have something for me.

599
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,331
[Blake] Hey.

600
00:35:27,166 --> 00:35:28,918
-You okay?
-No.

601
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:34,215
I was there.
I saw Willy, and I didn't see a note.

602
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:37,176
Then Stansfield's guy
just happens to find one

603
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,095
that lets us all off the hook?

604
00:35:39,178 --> 00:35:42,223
Shouldn't I be more of a suspect?
I found him.

605
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:44,725
-What are you trying to say?
-Just... it...

606
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:46,811
It seems off.

607
00:35:46,894 --> 00:35:50,064
A week ago, Willy was
accusing you of killing Matthew.

608
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:54,610
-Why would he suddenly admit it now?
-Guilt is an unpredictable animal.

609
00:35:55,194 --> 00:35:56,445
Or Stansfield is.

610
00:35:56,529 --> 00:36:00,867
You're shaken. We've been through the
wringer. But Stansfield is not a bad guy.

611
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:04,370
He's only helped this family.

612
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:19,218
[Fallon] Whoa.

613
00:36:19,886 --> 00:36:22,180
Did someone go a little hard
at the club?

614
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:25,308
-No, I'm just beat.
-Ugh. Me, too.

615
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:29,395
If I have to take one more call
to comment on this video...

616
00:36:29,478 --> 00:36:32,273
It's not even news anymore.
Even I'm over it.

617
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:34,066
-Are you?
-Sorry?

618
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:37,153
You took that phone.
You leaked the video.

619
00:36:37,236 --> 00:36:38,863
I didn't take the phone.

620
00:36:38,946 --> 00:36:42,241
[scoffs] You're like a human bulldozer.
You'll crush anyone.

621
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:45,620
Cristal's a big girl.
She doesn't need you defending her.

622
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:48,789
Maybe someone should defend
the world from Fallon.

623
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:51,876
The way you treat her,
the way you treated Kori.

624
00:36:51,959 --> 00:36:53,044
Kori?

625
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:56,172
You just don't see other people.

626
00:36:56,255 --> 00:36:59,050
Kori hates me
because I was a bitch in school.

627
00:36:59,133 --> 00:37:03,137
When your mom leaves in sophomore year,
it messes with your head.

628
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:05,681
If I didn't defend myself, who would've?

629
00:37:08,935 --> 00:37:10,228
That is heartbreaking.

630
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:15,358
But it was almost ten years ago.
Maybe you should stop blaming your mom

631
00:37:15,441 --> 00:37:18,444
and try to figure out
why you're so screwed up now.

632
00:37:22,114 --> 00:37:23,407
[door opens]

633
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:35,586
Hey.

634
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:39,423
Sorry I didn't get a chance
to congratulate you.

635
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:41,717
I was coming to apologize to you.

636
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:45,721
What you said yesterday
about my privilege, you were right.

637
00:37:47,014 --> 00:37:50,101
I should've been honest.
I was trying to protect you.

638
00:37:50,184 --> 00:37:54,146
-But I just ended up hurting more people.
-Don't feel too bad.

639
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:57,817
You were right about that guy.
I shouldn't have trusted him.

640
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:01,070
But the thing is,
I should've been arrested, too.

641
00:38:01,153 --> 00:38:03,030
What? Why?

642
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:04,448
Because I set it up.

643
00:38:06,742 --> 00:38:10,454
-I told him to steal my aunt's ring.
-Are you kidding me?

644
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:12,123
I know.

645
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:16,877
-My mom needed money fast. I panicked.
-You're the reason this happened?

646
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:19,797
It got out of control. I needed you
to help. I didn't think you would

647
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:22,008
-if I told you the truth.
-You're right, I wouldn't.

648
00:38:22,091 --> 00:38:24,969
I know you hate being lied to.
I wanted to come clean.

649
00:38:25,052 --> 00:38:27,972
You think that fixes this?
I did this to help you.

650
00:38:28,055 --> 00:38:31,559
-You're telling me it's all your fault?
-I know. I'm sorry.

651
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:33,561
I don't accept that.

652
00:38:33,936 --> 00:38:36,480
I get now why your aunt
didn't want you here.

653
00:38:43,195 --> 00:38:47,450
The press isn't going away.
I think I need to make a statement.

654
00:38:47,533 --> 00:38:51,495
I'm not gonna make you do that.
Let the FBI tell them about Willy.

655
00:38:51,912 --> 00:38:54,582
It's not about Willy.
I didn't get a say

656
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:58,419
-in this thing getting out.
-I should've told you about the phone.

657
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:03,716
I should've told you about the robbery.

658
00:39:03,799 --> 00:39:06,635
After the fact, Sam told me that
it was his friend

659
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:09,347
and that he was involved.
I should've told you,

660
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:12,975
but he's a good kid, Blake.
He made a mistake.

661
00:39:14,977 --> 00:39:18,689
Any other day,
I would probably be upset...

662
00:39:20,566 --> 00:39:22,443
but I made a mistake, too.

663
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:27,281
Remember the day we took our engagement
photos and Matthew came to the house?

664
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:29,784
-Of course.
-I told you we hadn't argued.

665
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:32,912
He threatened me.
He said you wouldn't marry me

666
00:39:32,995 --> 00:39:35,831
-if you knew the kind of man I was.
-Blackmail you with what?

667
00:39:35,915 --> 00:39:38,959
Steven. You know
that before Steven ran off

668
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:42,296
to dig wells in Haiti
that he was with the company.

669
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:45,508
He didn't want the job.
I pushed him up the ladder.

670
00:39:45,591 --> 00:39:49,804
He missed a faulty pressure valve
and he signed off on the inspection.

671
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:51,806
-My God.
-When they put it online,

672
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:55,393
the pressure shook the rig,
a man fell off and snapped his neck.

673
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:59,480
-How come I never heard about this?
-Matthew was the field engineer.

674
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:02,650
I asked him to write it off
as a structural defect.

675
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:04,276
He covered it up.

676
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:07,279
Matthew claimed to have a record of it
on his phone.

677
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:13,160
I knew if Steven found out he had
something to do with the man's death,

678
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:14,870
he would never stop blaming himself.

679
00:40:14,954 --> 00:40:16,872
[reporter speaking indistinctly on TV]

680
00:40:16,956 --> 00:40:18,624
[Blake]  I was trying to protect him.

681
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:24,088
And I ended up sacrificing you.
I'm so sorry, Cristal.

682
00:40:25,965 --> 00:40:30,302
I understand.
I was just trying to protect Sam.

683
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:31,804
That's what family does.

684
00:40:33,055 --> 00:40:37,309
No matter how hard or how much it hurts,
we stand by them.

685
00:40:59,373 --> 00:41:00,541
But you and I...

686
00:41:02,835 --> 00:41:04,753
I don't want us to have secrets.

687
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:08,299
I wanna trust you,
and I want you to trust me.

688
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,261
Can we start again, clean slate?

689
00:41:14,513 --> 00:41:15,639
No more lies.

690
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:19,560
No more lies.
