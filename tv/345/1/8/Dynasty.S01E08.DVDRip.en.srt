Why in the world
would I wanna do that?

You know very well that
I've been waiting around for those leases.

Yes, sir.

Your son opened up to you.

He threw himself at you at your mercy.

ever expect to be close to him?

Is it Steven that you're so concerned about

That's a rotten thing to say.

Matthew was your friend.

Up until six weeks ago,

Yes, then he quit. He walked out on me.

on his own,just like you did.
And he's failing.

You invited him that evening

But what you really were doing was trying to
seduce him back into your company, right?

00:32:11,453 --> 00:32:15,082
Right. Yes. And I used this house...

353

and the important guests to sell him...

if you let me see your feelings.

448
00:39:36,298 --> 00:39:40,530
<i>Shared with me. Now, share it.</i>

449
00:39:40,635 --> 00:39:45,971
It's okay. I promise I'm not gonna
tell anyone you're a human being...

450
00:39:46,074 --> 00:39:50,636
<i>with anger, with fear.</i>

451
00:39:50,746 --> 00:39:53,544
And vulnerability.

452
00:39:56,351 --> 00:39:58,717
And gentleness.

453
00:40:01,056 --> 00:40:03,447
Come on.

454
00:40:34,856 --> 00:40:37,654
[ Woman ] Hello.
I need to talk. Can we meet?

455
00:40:43,231 --> 00:40:45,859
And you've worked for most of
the executives in the company...

456
00:40:45,967 --> 00:40:48,094
so I know you've handled
private things for them.

457
00:40:48,203 --> 00:40:52,833
Krystle, if this is about that necklace
you showed me, please don't even ask.

458
00:40:52,941 --> 00:40:58,243
And I know that, uh,
you know places where they...

459
00:40:58,346 --> 00:41:01,474
can copy jewelry so well
that not even the owner...

460
00:41:01,583 --> 00:41:04,051
knows the difference between
the copy and the original.

461
00:41:04,152 --> 00:41:06,120
The fake and the original.

462
00:41:06,221 --> 00:41:09,520
And I know you know places where
you can get cash discreetly...

463
00:41:09,624 --> 00:41:14,425
for certain items of value.
Krystle, I don't wanna do this.

464
00:41:14,529 --> 00:41:16,429
But you will.
Why?

465
00:41:16,531 --> 00:41:19,989
Because you're my friend.
[ Exhales ]

466
00:41:20,101 --> 00:41:24,231
Will you help me?
Look, I'd do anything in the world for you.

467
00:41:24,339 --> 00:41:27,308
I mean, you help me out all the time.
Look, what I did once is

468
00:41:27,409 --> 00:41:30,037
Come on. I couldn't have
gotten through that divorce without you.

469
00:41:30,145 --> 00:41:33,945
I mean, you helped me out
when I thought it was all over.

470
00:41:34,049 --> 00:41:38,509
But, Krystle, you've got a bigger problem.

471
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:41,088
I don't think you wanna face it.

472
00:41:41,189 --> 00:41:44,989
What do you mean?
Which one of them are you in love with?

473
00:41:46,695 --> 00:41:49,994
What do you mean?
Look, you're doing this for Matthew, right?

474
00:41:51,466 --> 00:41:53,934
And Blake knows nothing about it.

475
00:41:55,904 --> 00:41:59,340
So, which one of them are you in love with?

476
00:41:59,441 --> 00:42:01,875
I love my husband.

477
00:42:03,545 --> 00:42:07,504
I can't just wipe out the fact that
there was a Matthew in my life.

478
00:42:07,616 --> 00:42:12,417
I never planned it this way. I mean,
it's not even supposed to be this way, is it?

479
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:15,250
So you love Matthew;
so you're gonna give him the money.

480
00:42:15,357 --> 00:42:20,693
I was used, and I used Matthew, and I'm only
trying to make it up to him, and that's all.

481
00:42:20,795 --> 00:42:24,424
Remember when Melanie
and I were up at your house...

482
00:42:24,532 --> 00:42:27,160
and I was doing my bit
about what a princess you'd become?

483
00:42:27,269 --> 00:42:29,965
Well, I was rude.
[ Scoffs ] I was envious.

484
00:42:30,071 --> 00:42:32,198
Feeling sorry for myself.

485
00:42:32,307 --> 00:42:35,105
Living in my little threeroom apartment...

486
00:42:35,210 --> 00:42:39,169
eating TV dinners, driving around
in that old Chevy.

487
00:42:39,281 --> 00:42:42,250
But I'll tell you

488
00:42:42,350 --> 00:42:45,808
Right now, I wouldn't change places
with you for all the big houses...

489
00:42:45,921 --> 00:42:48,719
limousines and caviar in the world.

490
00:42:56,498 --> 00:42:58,466
Will you help me?

491
00:43:37,038 --> 00:43:40,838
Hello, Matthew.
Krystle.

492
00:43:40,942 --> 00:43:42,500
May I come in?

493
00:43:57,892 --> 00:43:59,860
How did you know where I was?

494
00:44:01,730 --> 00:44:04,255
I found out.

495
00:44:27,088 --> 00:44:29,386
Well, I don't know what this is all about

496
00:44:29,491 --> 00:44:31,516
Matthew, I know you need it, so take it.

497
00:44:31,626 --> 00:44:35,926
<i>And before you say no, remember
youyou have a wife and a daughter...</i>

498
00:44:36,031 --> 00:44:40,434
and a lot of men that are counting on you
to bring in that oil well.

499
00:44:40,535 --> 00:44:43,368
<i>So just take it.</i>

500
00:44:43,471 --> 00:44:48,272
And, um, fish out that drill bit...

501
00:44:48,376 --> 00:44:51,004
andand pay me back when you can.

502
00:44:51,112 --> 00:44:52,875
How long do I have?

503
00:44:55,083 --> 00:44:57,074
For six months I'm okay.

504
00:44:57,185 --> 00:45:01,383
I know Blake wants this place.
We both do.

505
00:45:10,098 --> 00:45:12,726
So why are you doing this?

506
00:45:15,770 --> 00:45:19,797
Don't ask me why. I have my reasons.

507
00:45:51,039 --> 00:45:53,132
Oh, Krystle, I love you.

508
00:45:53,241 --> 00:45:56,699
I love you too.

509
00:46:27,775 --> 00:46:30,767
No, Matthew.

510
00:46:30,879 --> 00:46:34,440
I can't give you anything else
that belongs to him.

511
00:46:35,984 --> 00:46:38,579
Krystle.
