1
00:00:00,839 --> 00:00:04,056
- <i>Previously on</i> Dynasty...
- Among my responsibilities

2
00:00:04,058 --> 00:00:05,290
is running background checks.

3
00:00:05,292 --> 00:00:07,326
I know everything.

4
00:00:07,328 --> 00:00:09,228
Kori, this is Michael Culhane.

5
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:11,096
<i>Is that why you slept with Kori?
To get back at me?</i>

6
00:00:11,098 --> 00:00:12,831
<i>I don't use people
to hurt others, Fallon.</i>

7
00:00:12,833 --> 00:00:14,133
That's you.

8
00:00:14,135 --> 00:00:16,068
<i>Chief Aaron?
He's the best. Convinced your dad</i>

9
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:17,603
to give the club 250K per year.

10
00:00:17,605 --> 00:00:18,637
I thought it was a million.

11
00:00:18,639 --> 00:00:19,772
I'm about to right a wrong.

12
00:00:19,774 --> 00:00:22,374
You know, hacking
isn't my game anymore, right?

13
00:00:22,376 --> 00:00:24,576
I'm going after the police chief...
Stansfield.

14
00:00:24,578 --> 00:00:26,011
Dinner with Kori, but...

15
00:00:26,013 --> 00:00:28,213
- maybe dessert back here.
- Mm, no.

16
00:00:28,215 --> 00:00:30,682
But I'll never turn down another
bite of that sweet potato pie.

17
00:00:31,562 --> 00:00:32,484
Sounds good.

18
00:00:32,882 --> 00:00:34,885
_

19
00:00:34,922 --> 00:00:36,855
I think we should have a kid.
All this tragedy

20
00:00:36,857 --> 00:00:39,391
with Matthew, Willy,
Claudia, it's all over.

21
00:00:39,393 --> 00:00:41,260
This is our chance to
start something new.

22
00:00:41,262 --> 00:00:43,428
Let's put the past behind us.

23
00:00:43,429 --> 00:00:45,775
_

24
00:00:45,776 --> 00:00:47,146
_

25
00:00:47,147 --> 00:00:48,738
_

26
00:01:14,711 --> 00:01:16,878
- That was the one.
- Mm.

27
00:01:22,586 --> 00:01:24,819
- Where's my coffee?
- Fallon.

28
00:01:24,821 --> 00:01:26,187
Good to have you back.

29
00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:27,922
- I think.
- Mm.

30
00:01:27,924 --> 00:01:29,824
Jeff had way better coffee at his house.

31
00:01:30,571 --> 00:01:32,627
Perhaps you should have stayed there.

32
00:01:33,081 --> 00:01:35,897
Come on, Steven.
What, no witty repartee?

33
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,501
You're not still in a lather
about Stansfield, are you?

34
00:01:39,503 --> 00:01:42,570
No. Just been slammed
with foundation stuff.

35
00:01:42,606 --> 00:01:43,792
And I'm late.

36
00:01:43,974 --> 00:01:46,608
- Morning.
- Good morning, sir.

37
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:48,910
The Carrington Atlantic
gift strategists are

38
00:01:48,912 --> 00:01:50,345
on their way... Should I set them up

39
00:01:50,347 --> 00:01:51,613
- in the study?
- Please.

40
00:01:51,615 --> 00:01:54,182
- Gift strategists?
- Holiday gifts for our clients.

41
00:01:54,184 --> 00:01:56,117
C.A.'s sponsoring the
Tree Lighting Ceremony

42
00:01:56,119 --> 00:01:57,752
in midtown... this year.

43
00:01:58,272 --> 00:01:59,654
I thought I'd hand out the gifts then.

44
00:02:00,624 --> 00:02:02,023
Don't tell me.

45
00:02:02,025 --> 00:02:04,426
You forgot your year-end
business presents.

46
00:02:04,428 --> 00:02:06,061
What do you take me for?

47
00:02:06,063 --> 00:02:08,296
No. Of course. Morell Corp.
has something in the works.

48
00:02:08,298 --> 00:02:10,131
- Do I get one of these gifts, too?
- No.

49
00:02:10,133 --> 00:02:11,933
Your life's been one
big Christmas morning

50
00:02:11,935 --> 00:02:13,335
since you arrived.

51
00:02:15,739 --> 00:02:17,739
So, what are you gonna do?

52
00:02:17,741 --> 00:02:19,341
About the client gifts you don't have.

53
00:02:19,343 --> 00:02:21,710
- Like I said, it's in the works.
- Your dad might fall

54
00:02:21,712 --> 00:02:24,412
for your act, but he gives you
more credit than you deserve.

55
00:02:24,414 --> 00:02:26,181
We all know that you have a blind spot

56
00:02:26,183 --> 00:02:27,816
when it comes to thinking
about other people.

57
00:02:27,818 --> 00:02:29,384
I have no blind spots.

58
00:02:29,386 --> 00:02:31,720
I see all spots, just like I see you,

59
00:02:31,722 --> 00:02:34,089
eating your croissants while you may,

60
00:02:34,091 --> 00:02:36,424
trying desperately to
claim a seat at this table.

61
00:02:37,041 --> 00:02:39,894
But unless you're a Carrington,
or work for a Carrington,

62
00:02:39,896 --> 00:02:41,796
no one cares what you think.

63
00:02:41,798 --> 00:02:44,199
Especially not me.

64
00:02:47,401 --> 00:02:48,203
<i>Hey.</i>

65
00:02:48,205 --> 00:02:51,306
I need a shopping partner, and a ride.

66
00:02:53,343 --> 00:02:55,310
Oh. Looks like someone

67
00:02:55,312 --> 00:02:57,679
- already got one.
- Have you ever heard of knocking?

68
00:02:57,681 --> 00:03:00,382
Oh, you mean I can't just waltz
in here like I own the place?

69
00:03:00,384 --> 00:03:01,611
Because I do.

70
00:03:02,686 --> 00:03:04,719
So, how's the city job?

71
00:03:04,721 --> 00:03:06,054
The only job I want to talk about

72
00:03:06,056 --> 00:03:07,355
is the faux-job you gave my boyfriend.

73
00:03:07,357 --> 00:03:09,157
"Faux-job"?

74
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:11,359
Wow, that's pretty great.
You know, you could argue

75
00:03:11,361 --> 00:03:14,295
that me pretending to blow
Culhane was a<i> good</i> thing.

76
00:03:14,297 --> 00:03:16,197
You two came out stronger than ever.

77
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:17,499
Are you trippin'?

78
00:03:17,535 --> 00:03:20,068
What is going on?

79
00:03:27,405 --> 00:03:29,878
Maybe you should change your locks.

80
00:03:34,084 --> 00:03:36,251
I'd say she wasn't getting enough sugar,

81
00:03:36,253 --> 00:03:37,519
but knowing you...

82
00:03:37,521 --> 00:03:39,487
Fallon. You can't just barge in here

83
00:03:39,489 --> 00:03:41,055
with no respect for boundaries.

84
00:03:41,057 --> 00:03:42,490
Boundaries?

85
00:03:42,492 --> 00:03:43,943
But we shared pie.

86
00:03:44,027 --> 00:03:46,027
Okay, well,
Kori doesn't want to share pie.

87
00:03:46,029 --> 00:03:48,730
And she doesn't want to be
reminded that you and I shared pie.

88
00:03:48,732 --> 00:03:50,598
I think that you're
using pie as a metaphor,

89
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,000
but I mean actual pie.

90
00:03:52,002 --> 00:03:54,035
Fallon.

91
00:03:54,037 --> 00:03:55,403
You can't expect Kori
to be cool with you

92
00:03:55,405 --> 00:03:58,373
after what you put her through.

93
00:03:59,242 --> 00:04:01,209
You got to give us space.

94
00:04:10,139 --> 00:04:11,686
The doctor will be right with you.

95
00:04:11,688 --> 00:04:13,588
Thank you.

96
00:04:20,439 --> 00:04:21,809
_

97
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:23,889
_

98
00:04:23,954 --> 00:04:25,637
_

99
00:04:25,638 --> 00:04:28,113
_

100
00:04:28,114 --> 00:04:29,245
_

101
00:04:29,246 --> 00:04:30,716
_

102
00:04:30,717 --> 00:04:31,717
_

103
00:04:31,718 --> 00:04:32,718
_

104
00:04:38,815 --> 00:04:41,749
So, everything looks good.

105
00:04:41,751 --> 00:04:43,051
Are you sure?

106
00:04:43,635 --> 00:04:44,919
Were you worried you're pregnant?

107
00:04:45,561 --> 00:04:46,955
Don't be.

108
00:04:46,957 --> 00:04:48,323
Your IUD is still effective.

109
00:04:48,325 --> 00:04:50,458
It should protect you from pregnancies

110
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:52,327
for at least two more years.

111
00:04:52,329 --> 00:04:54,095
Perfect.

112
00:04:58,855 --> 00:04:59,968
<i>Sir, the gift strategists</i>

113
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:01,369
are at the gate.

114
00:05:01,371 --> 00:05:03,972
But you have another guest...
Chief Stansfield.

115
00:05:03,974 --> 00:05:05,139
Coffee, sir?

116
00:05:05,141 --> 00:05:07,308
Or scotch and cigars, perhaps?

117
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:08,943
This isn't a social call.

118
00:05:08,945 --> 00:05:10,411
Ah.

119
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:14,415
I know why you're here.
You'll have it soon.

120
00:05:14,417 --> 00:05:16,117
I don't doubt you're good for the money.

121
00:05:16,119 --> 00:05:18,086
I'm more concerned about your son.

122
00:05:18,088 --> 00:05:19,821
Steven didn't know what he was doing

123
00:05:19,823 --> 00:05:21,623
when he moved those foundation funds.

124
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:22,824
Seems to me he did.

125
00:05:22,826 --> 00:05:25,026
He's a kid...

126
00:05:25,028 --> 00:05:27,929
on some dumb moral crusade,
but it's harmless.

127
00:05:27,931 --> 00:05:31,165
He just doesn't understand the
value you bring to this family.

128
00:05:32,536 --> 00:05:33,968
I'll talk some sense into him.

129
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:35,403
You don't need to worry.

130
00:05:35,405 --> 00:05:37,071
You're right, I don't.

131
00:05:37,073 --> 00:05:38,406
You do.

132
00:05:39,376 --> 00:05:40,808
Sorry, sir.

133
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:42,577
Uh, the gift strategists.

134
00:05:42,579 --> 00:05:45,580
That's right, Christmas is coming.

135
00:05:47,584 --> 00:05:49,784
What good's all the money, Blake,

136
00:05:49,786 --> 00:05:52,353
if you don't have the
freedom to spend it?

137
00:05:54,324 --> 00:05:56,658
Or the family to spend it on.

138
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:09,690
- What is all this?
- 'Tis the season to show

139
00:06:09,692 --> 00:06:10,858
our clients how much we appreciate them.

140
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:13,327
And to show our competitors'
clients how much they're missing out.

141
00:06:13,329 --> 00:06:14,896
Aren't we doing a holiday party?

142
00:06:14,898 --> 00:06:17,477
People forget parties as
soon as the hangover fades.

143
00:06:17,512 --> 00:06:20,210
If we can butter up C.A.'s
clients by giving them

144
00:06:20,245 --> 00:06:21,843
a memorable present,
then maybe some of them

145
00:06:21,878 --> 00:06:23,073
will be swayed to meet with us.

146
00:06:23,108 --> 00:06:24,906
Let me show you what I've got.

147
00:06:26,245 --> 00:06:26,974
<i>An entry-level</i>

148
00:06:26,976 --> 00:06:28,543
Patek Philippe for $20,000.

149
00:06:28,545 --> 00:06:31,643
A watch meant to be passed
from generation to generation.

150
00:06:31,678 --> 00:06:34,649
A private island
available for client use.

151
00:06:34,651 --> 00:06:37,685
It comes with its own designer villa,
butler and staff.

152
00:06:37,887 --> 00:06:39,820
- And a yacht, of course.
- <i>Speyside single malt</i>

153
00:06:39,822 --> 00:06:40,921
from 1946.

154
00:06:40,923 --> 00:06:44,091
One pour is worth nearly $1,000.

155
00:06:44,093 --> 00:06:45,826
Your typical blinged-out power bank,

156
00:06:45,828 --> 00:06:47,094
with real bling.

157
00:06:47,858 --> 00:06:48,772
<i>Clubs...</i>

158
00:06:48,807 --> 00:06:50,665
- and caviar.
- <i>Gold,</i>

159
00:06:50,667 --> 00:06:53,467
diamonds and electricity
never lose their value.

160
00:06:53,469 --> 00:06:55,469
Presented with Petrossian caviar,

161
00:06:55,471 --> 00:06:57,204
valued at $1,000 per tin.

162
00:06:57,936 --> 00:06:58,773
<i>A little something for everyone.</i>

163
00:06:59,565 --> 00:07:01,275
I need to get on with my day.
Anything else?

164
00:07:01,277 --> 00:07:03,545
And who doesn't love puppies?

165
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:05,546
Especially ones that have
been genetically engineered

166
00:07:05,548 --> 00:07:07,381
to fit in stockings.

167
00:07:07,383 --> 00:07:09,850
I think we need to dial it back.

168
00:07:09,852 --> 00:07:11,152
We're a start-up.

169
00:07:11,154 --> 00:07:12,820
Keep it to three figures per client.

170
00:07:12,822 --> 00:07:15,523
Three figures?
My haircut costs more than that.

171
00:07:15,525 --> 00:07:17,058
Monica can help.

172
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:20,261
She handles gifts for Colby Co.,
and gets the brand.

173
00:07:20,263 --> 00:07:24,732
Fine. My father hands his out at
the tree lighting, so I figure

174
00:07:24,734 --> 00:07:26,367
we'll messenger ours out next week.

175
00:07:26,369 --> 00:07:29,170
So, you're going
to the lighting ceremony.

176
00:07:30,115 --> 00:07:32,173
- You want to go together?
- Well, I usually go

177
00:07:32,175 --> 00:07:33,708
with Culhane,
but I figure his girlfriend

178
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:36,577
wouldn't be down with that.

179
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,412
You know what?

180
00:07:38,414 --> 00:07:41,849
I just realized what I'm giving
Culhane for Christmas this year.

181
00:07:41,851 --> 00:07:43,517
- Space?
- No.

182
00:07:44,414 --> 00:07:47,054
- I'm going to make a new friend.
- Who?

183
00:07:47,056 --> 00:07:48,956
- Don't say Kori.
- Kori.

184
00:07:52,356 --> 00:07:53,260
That's right.

185
00:07:53,262 --> 00:07:56,163
I need to talk to the security team.

186
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:58,165
What are you doing in here?

187
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,835
I just wanted to drop this off.

188
00:08:00,837 --> 00:08:02,036
It's my résumé.

189
00:08:03,164 --> 00:08:06,140
Oh. And a little... powdered sugar.
Sorry.

190
00:08:06,142 --> 00:08:08,476
It just so happens that
I have a PhD in shopping

191
00:08:08,478 --> 00:08:10,778
and a master's in how to be memorable.

192
00:08:11,748 --> 00:08:13,547
I can find you a gift that'll keep you

193
00:08:13,549 --> 00:08:14,949
at the top of your clients' minds.

194
00:08:14,951 --> 00:08:16,283
And you know nothing about my clients.

195
00:08:16,285 --> 00:08:18,252
But I know your competition.

196
00:08:19,236 --> 00:08:20,663
Fallon's desperate to top you

197
00:08:20,698 --> 00:08:22,590
and to send her gift to
your entire client list.

198
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:26,670
Please, Sam, I don't have the bandwidth

199
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:28,238
to deal with this right now.

200
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,874
Perfect. I'll deal with it for you.

201
00:08:33,382 --> 00:08:36,113
Those are seven high-profile
cases that Stanfield's

202
00:08:36,115 --> 00:08:38,382
been involved in. If you pull those

203
00:08:38,384 --> 00:08:40,817
police records, I bet we'll find
something incriminating.

204
00:08:40,819 --> 00:08:43,153
But hacking into Atlanta PD records?

205
00:08:43,155 --> 00:08:44,388
That's illegal.

206
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:46,156
It was also illegal for Stansfield

207
00:08:46,158 --> 00:08:48,158
to question you as a murder suspect

208
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,927
just because my father told him to.

209
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:53,363
No one should be able to
buy the law like that.

210
00:08:54,233 --> 00:08:56,066
Say I'm game.

211
00:08:56,068 --> 00:08:57,574
I don't see Blake's name in here.

212
00:08:57,637 --> 00:08:59,937
He would lawyer up so hard,

213
00:08:59,939 --> 00:09:02,005
Stansfield might end up
slipping away as well.

214
00:09:02,007 --> 00:09:04,708
Yeah, I'm...
pretty familiar with Blake's lawyers.

215
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,243
Not to mention,

216
00:09:06,245 --> 00:09:08,912
any strike on him would
blow back on all of us.

217
00:09:08,914 --> 00:09:11,114
You're in business with my sister now.

218
00:09:12,484 --> 00:09:14,685
For our family,
that means more than marriage.

219
00:09:55,239 --> 00:09:56,660
I mean,
I don't even know what else to cut.

220
00:09:56,662 --> 00:09:58,262
With this budget,
we'd have to power down

221
00:09:58,304 --> 00:10:00,471
every public library the
last two weeks of December.

222
00:10:00,473 --> 00:10:02,467
I don't mean to intrude,

223
00:10:02,502 --> 00:10:04,041
but I got you a ticket

224
00:10:04,043 --> 00:10:06,510
to the Annual Carrington
Tree Lighting Ceremony.

225
00:10:06,512 --> 00:10:08,212
The tree lighting may be sponsored

226
00:10:08,214 --> 00:10:10,414
by Carrington Atlantic,
but it's a city event.

227
00:10:10,416 --> 00:10:12,950
In front of City Hall, where I work.

228
00:10:12,952 --> 00:10:15,419
Why would I need your invitation?

229
00:10:15,421 --> 00:10:17,087
Why are you really here, Fallon?

230
00:10:17,089 --> 00:10:19,892
Culhane is my friend and
you're his girlfriend,

231
00:10:19,927 --> 00:10:22,559
so it stands to reason that you and I
are gonna run into each other a lot.

232
00:10:22,561 --> 00:10:24,128
Is that a threat?

233
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:25,962
No. I'm just saying you
and I should be friends,

234
00:10:26,032 --> 00:10:29,267
- for all of our sakes.
- So, basically, you want me

235
00:10:29,302 --> 00:10:31,101
to make it more convenient for
you to spend time with my man.

236
00:10:31,103 --> 00:10:33,604
It's not just about Culhane. I mean...

237
00:10:33,606 --> 00:10:34,972
I will be the first to admit

238
00:10:34,974 --> 00:10:37,574
- I don't have many girlfriends.
- How can that be?

239
00:10:37,576 --> 00:10:39,977
Come on, Kori, you're making
this harder than it needs to be.

240
00:10:39,979 --> 00:10:41,779
Look, it's not like Culhane and I

241
00:10:41,781 --> 00:10:43,781
were even in love. It was just...

242
00:10:43,783 --> 00:10:45,282
booty calls and limo sex.

243
00:10:45,992 --> 00:10:46,884
Tell that to him.

244
00:10:47,846 --> 00:10:49,386
Wait, he said it was more than that?

245
00:10:50,406 --> 00:10:53,023
And that is exactly why
we aren't hanging out.

246
00:10:53,025 --> 00:10:56,026
<i>Why are you still
barking up that poor girl?</i>

247
00:10:56,028 --> 00:10:58,595
I thought that if I tried
to make friends with her,

248
00:10:58,597 --> 00:11:00,898
- I could...
- Let him go, Fallon.

249
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:03,100
Close the door. Can we focus?

250
00:11:03,102 --> 00:11:04,969
Morell is super innovative, right?

251
00:11:04,971 --> 00:11:06,437
So what if we give a tech gift?

252
00:11:06,439 --> 00:11:08,405
Like one of those little
waterproof cameras?

253
00:11:08,407 --> 00:11:09,873
- Or an e-reader?
- I'm sorry,

254
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:11,942
I just fell asleep and woke up in 2010.

255
00:11:11,944 --> 00:11:14,111
If we do tech,
it has to be cutting-edge,

256
00:11:14,113 --> 00:11:16,280
something everyone wants.

257
00:11:16,282 --> 00:11:18,048
Is that a pic from the Bahamas?

258
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:20,551
Just one of the thousands
of selfies I took.

259
00:11:20,553 --> 00:11:23,921
Rum and coconuts are not that
fun when you're by yourself.

260
00:11:23,923 --> 00:11:25,489
Wasn't Jeff with you?

261
00:11:26,577 --> 00:11:27,791
Yeah, but he's my brother,

262
00:11:27,793 --> 00:11:30,527
- so it doesn't count.
- Oh, my God, you are so lying.

263
00:11:30,529 --> 00:11:32,796
If Jeff wasn't with you,
who was he with?

264
00:11:32,798 --> 00:11:35,912
Nobody special, okay?
Let's just get back to the gifts.

265
00:11:35,947 --> 00:11:37,001
Here's a pitch.

266
00:11:37,003 --> 00:11:38,369
You can never go wrong with tequila.

267
00:11:38,371 --> 00:11:39,803
Yeah, tell that to your parents.
Look, Sam,

268
00:11:39,805 --> 00:11:41,839
this is a work zone,
for people with jobs.

269
00:11:41,841 --> 00:11:44,675
Jobs where you can wear pajamas
all day? Sign me up.

270
00:11:44,677 --> 00:11:47,111
- Gigi Hadid wore these last week.
- In fact,

271
00:11:47,113 --> 00:11:49,315
I have a business proposition.
With the, uh,

272
00:11:49,315 --> 00:11:51,315
proper financial incentive,

273
00:11:51,317 --> 00:11:53,017
I can tell you what your dad's giving.

274
00:11:53,019 --> 00:11:54,985
Wow, what a great idea. Or I could just

275
00:11:54,987 --> 00:11:58,022
walk into his study for free
and find out for myself.

276
00:11:59,992 --> 00:12:01,992
Oh. I know what we can give.

277
00:12:01,994 --> 00:12:04,628
Jeff knows a guy who can
get the Google Pixel.

278
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:06,230
That phone's selling out all over.

279
00:12:06,232 --> 00:12:08,499
What if we can get him to
hook us up with a shipment?

280
00:12:08,501 --> 00:12:10,100
Something everyone wants,

281
00:12:10,102 --> 00:12:11,568
cutting-edge tech.

282
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:12,569
I think it's perfect.

283
00:12:12,571 --> 00:12:14,772
I'll call Jeff.

284
00:12:38,104 --> 00:12:38,862
<i>I'll let you know</i>

285
00:12:38,864 --> 00:12:41,018
if I find anything
useful in those cases.

286
00:12:41,053 --> 00:12:42,332
I owe you.

287
00:13:05,196 --> 00:13:09,131
I knew you had a fishy past,
but real fish?

288
00:13:09,133 --> 00:13:11,167
It's a bit on the nose.
I kept your secret

289
00:13:11,235 --> 00:13:13,769
because I thought I was dealing
with a harmless gold digger,

290
00:13:13,771 --> 00:13:17,306
but when the gold digger
has gold diggers...

291
00:13:17,308 --> 00:13:18,674
I think it's time to come clean.

292
00:13:18,676 --> 00:13:19,893
You can't tell Blake.

293
00:13:20,233 --> 00:13:22,511
He'll never look at
me the same way again.

294
00:13:23,644 --> 00:13:25,411
Says here they want $300,000.

295
00:13:25,413 --> 00:13:27,780
- Let's hope it's in bolivares.
- It isn't.

296
00:13:29,884 --> 00:13:33,085
Back in Caracas, my sister and
I stole from some bad people.

297
00:13:33,087 --> 00:13:34,553
Exporters.

298
00:13:34,555 --> 00:13:37,690
- Fishermen, by chance?
- That was just their cover.

299
00:13:37,692 --> 00:13:39,125
We didn't know how dangerous they were.

300
00:13:39,127 --> 00:13:40,559
We needed the cash.

301
00:13:40,561 --> 00:13:41,994
It was a medical emergency,

302
00:13:41,996 --> 00:13:43,496
we had no other choice.

303
00:13:43,498 --> 00:13:45,398
Now these men have followed me here.

304
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,967
Not hard, considering you're in
the headlines every other week.

305
00:13:48,867 --> 00:13:50,836
I don't know who else to turn to.

306
00:13:51,587 --> 00:13:54,173
You manage the accounts.

307
00:13:54,175 --> 00:13:56,308
You could access those kind of funds.

308
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:58,778
Keeping your secret is one thing.

309
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:00,413
Participating is another.

310
00:14:00,415 --> 00:14:02,648
I'm sure you'll find a way.

311
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:04,316
By hook or by crook.

312
00:14:10,792 --> 00:14:13,592
What do you want? Money?

313
00:14:13,594 --> 00:14:15,661
I can call my father.

314
00:14:16,293 --> 00:14:19,031
Please, we can work this out.

315
00:14:21,602 --> 00:14:24,336
What the hell? You did this?

316
00:14:25,773 --> 00:14:27,473
You had me kidnapped by
our own security guys.

317
00:14:27,475 --> 00:14:29,942
You are lucky it's me;
next time it is going to be Stansfield.

318
00:14:29,944 --> 00:14:31,744
- Are you completely insane?
- You have been

319
00:14:31,746 --> 00:14:33,646
going on and on about
Stansfield for weeks.

320
00:14:33,648 --> 00:14:35,984
I have tried talking to you.
I have tried distracting you.

321
00:14:36,019 --> 00:14:37,383
How else am I supposed
to get you to understand

322
00:14:37,385 --> 00:14:38,851
how serious this is?

323
00:14:38,853 --> 00:14:41,120
- You have to stop messing with him.
- How can I?

324
00:14:41,122 --> 00:14:43,255
He killed someone.
How can you be so unconcerned

325
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:44,690
that your puppet took an innocent life?

326
00:14:44,692 --> 00:14:47,359
I am very concerned
for<i> your</i> life, Steven.

327
00:14:48,308 --> 00:14:50,796
- You think he'd turn on us?
- I don't know how far he'll go, but I do know

328
00:14:50,798 --> 00:14:53,699
what he's capable of,
and I know that he can get away with it.

329
00:14:53,701 --> 00:14:55,501
We are not invincible.

330
00:14:55,934 --> 00:14:57,069
Just rich.

331
00:14:58,105 --> 00:14:59,705
If you care about this family,

332
00:14:59,707 --> 00:15:01,874
you will leave this alone.

333
00:15:12,753 --> 00:15:14,286
What are you doing up here?

334
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:15,988
Well, you don't seem
to understand boundaries,

335
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:17,823
so why should I?

336
00:15:17,825 --> 00:15:19,024
Why'd you go see Kori?

337
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,234
I was adulting.

338
00:15:21,269 --> 00:15:22,995
I asked her if she wanted to
hang out at the tree lighting,

339
00:15:22,997 --> 00:15:24,697
and she completely stonewalled me.

340
00:15:24,699 --> 00:15:27,566
I told you to give us space,
and you try to poach my date?

341
00:15:28,599 --> 00:15:30,569
Wait, you're taking her
to the tree lighting?

342
00:15:30,571 --> 00:15:32,338
But that's our thing.

343
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:34,440
I mean, we've always gone together.

344
00:15:34,442 --> 00:15:38,177
- That's our spot.
- Fallon, these boundaries aren't just for Kori.

345
00:15:38,179 --> 00:15:39,645
They're for me.

346
00:15:40,494 --> 00:15:42,314
I can't do this every day.

347
00:15:43,013 --> 00:15:44,950
I think about you when I shouldn't.

348
00:15:44,952 --> 00:15:48,020
And I need to get you out of my head.

349
00:15:48,022 --> 00:15:49,755
Or we'll just fall right
back into what we had.

350
00:15:50,771 --> 00:15:53,192
Would that be so wrong?

351
00:15:54,529 --> 00:15:55,828
Yes.

352
00:15:56,489 --> 00:15:57,263
It would.

353
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:02,701
I'm trying to move on.

354
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,580
Hey. I just got a text

355
00:16:14,582 --> 00:16:16,916
from my contact. Apparently,

356
00:16:16,918 --> 00:16:19,485
he got another inquiry about
those client gifts you're after.

357
00:16:19,487 --> 00:16:21,153
- From who?
- That's what I'm waiting to hear.

358
00:16:21,155 --> 00:16:23,255
I thought you might know something.

359
00:16:23,257 --> 00:16:25,424
I'll check in with you tomorrow.

360
00:16:26,427 --> 00:16:28,360
Hey...

361
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:30,829
do you still want to go to
that tree lighting together?

362
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:37,136
<i>I looked into those cases.</i>

363
00:16:37,138 --> 00:16:39,738
Stansfield's a cop who's
good at making his own rules

364
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:41,473
and covering his tracks.

365
00:16:41,475 --> 00:16:43,075
Do you remember Willy Miller?

366
00:16:43,077 --> 00:16:44,843
The guy who killed Blaisdel?

367
00:16:44,845 --> 00:16:46,679
The truth is he was set up.

368
00:16:47,815 --> 00:16:49,848
I'm sure that Stansfield murdered Willy

369
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:51,450
and made it look like a suicide.

370
00:16:51,452 --> 00:16:53,118
How do you know this?

371
00:16:54,046 --> 00:16:55,421
Because Stansfield did it

372
00:16:55,423 --> 00:16:57,323
to keep suspicion off me and my dad.

373
00:16:57,325 --> 00:17:00,159
Neither of us had anything
to do with Matthew's death.

374
00:17:00,161 --> 00:17:02,261
Stansfield went rogue.

375
00:17:02,263 --> 00:17:05,097
But that means we can use
Willy's murder to take him down.

376
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:07,066
But shining a light on Willy

377
00:17:07,068 --> 00:17:08,934
could blow back on you and Blake.

378
00:17:08,936 --> 00:17:12,137
I've never seen my father
the way he was last night.

379
00:17:12,139 --> 00:17:14,106
He was scared. Now that tells me

380
00:17:14,108 --> 00:17:15,574
he's lost control of Stansfield.

381
00:17:16,587 --> 00:17:18,944
What if Stansfield scrubbed
those records, too?

382
00:17:18,946 --> 00:17:21,413
Then we'll have to get him to
incriminate himself somehow.

383
00:17:22,039 --> 00:17:22,848
<i>I'm working</i>

384
00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:24,650
on behalf of Blake Carrington.

385
00:17:24,652 --> 00:17:29,455
Exactly. If you could rush it,
we'd really appreciate it.

386
00:17:29,457 --> 00:17:31,790
Uh, money's no object.

387
00:17:31,792 --> 00:17:34,226
No, happy holidays to you.

388
00:17:34,228 --> 00:17:37,129
Thanks. Hey, slow down.

389
00:17:37,131 --> 00:17:38,330
What's wrong?

390
00:17:39,787 --> 00:17:40,499
Nothing.

391
00:17:40,501 --> 00:17:42,635
Like hell. I know that walk.

392
00:17:46,107 --> 00:17:48,107
Have you spoken to Iris recently?

393
00:17:48,109 --> 00:17:49,675
Um, the day before yesterday.

394
00:17:49,677 --> 00:17:51,477
I think. What's up?

395
00:17:51,479 --> 00:17:54,013
Nothing.
I was sending her money every month

396
00:17:54,015 --> 00:17:56,348
through a transfer service,
and they shut down.

397
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:59,084
So I just need to find
a new solution is all.

398
00:17:59,086 --> 00:18:00,886
Or maybe it's time to bring her here.

399
00:18:00,888 --> 00:18:02,488
It's actually the worst time.

400
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:04,056
Why?

401
00:18:04,058 --> 00:18:06,258
You know how bad things
are in Venezuela.

402
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:08,827
It doesn't matter how
much money you have.

403
00:18:08,829 --> 00:18:11,096
There's no medicine, there's no food.

404
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:15,034
I know things are
complicated between you two.

405
00:18:15,036 --> 00:18:16,935
But if you really cared,

406
00:18:16,937 --> 00:18:18,837
whatever money you're
planning on sending her,

407
00:18:18,839 --> 00:18:21,073
you'd use it to get her out of there.

408
00:18:23,743 --> 00:18:26,087
_

409
00:18:26,088 --> 00:18:26,986
_

410
00:18:26,987 --> 00:18:31,086
_

411
00:18:31,087 --> 00:18:32,640
_

412
00:18:32,641 --> 00:18:34,241
_

413
00:18:34,509 --> 00:18:35,854
Aah!

414
00:18:37,853 --> 00:18:38,691
<i>Did you make a decision?</i>

415
00:18:38,693 --> 00:18:40,859
Are the holiday gifts all set?

416
00:18:40,861 --> 00:18:42,728
I think it's just gonna be the classic.

417
00:18:43,311 --> 00:18:44,530
Scotch and cigars.

418
00:18:44,532 --> 00:18:46,665
That's what your father
sent out every year,

419
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:48,667
and he built quite an empire.

420
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:50,602
Well, he didn't have a
daughter working against him.

421
00:18:50,604 --> 00:18:52,705
Or a son working against himself.

422
00:18:52,707 --> 00:18:55,641
And yet you're trying to
secure the Carrington legacy

423
00:18:55,643 --> 00:18:57,810
with the aid a woman
of questionable history

424
00:18:57,812 --> 00:18:59,311
and suspect moral character.

425
00:18:59,313 --> 00:19:01,113
Cristal? What do you mean?

426
00:19:01,115 --> 00:19:02,247
Well, do you really want to know?

427
00:19:02,249 --> 00:19:04,183
Your opinion?

428
00:19:04,185 --> 00:19:05,718
The staff's?

429
00:19:06,454 --> 00:19:08,020
Everybody has something
to say about Cristal...

430
00:19:08,022 --> 00:19:10,289
her affair, her sex tape.

431
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:13,192
But what no one's talking about
is just how far she's come.

432
00:19:13,194 --> 00:19:14,460
No one handed her her fortune.

433
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,829
No, she snatched it for herself.

434
00:19:16,831 --> 00:19:18,363
Exactly.

435
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:20,399
You know my own father
didn't come to our wedding

436
00:19:20,401 --> 00:19:22,034
because he didn't
approve of her pedigree?

437
00:19:22,885 --> 00:19:25,404
I didn't choose her because
of where she came from,

438
00:19:25,406 --> 00:19:28,040
just like she didn't
marry me for my baggage.

439
00:19:28,042 --> 00:19:29,842
We're just trying to move on.

440
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:33,545
As for a baby, don't worry.

441
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:35,647
We won't make you change diapers.

442
00:19:40,254 --> 00:19:42,154
♪ Ding, dong, merrily on high ♪

443
00:19:42,156 --> 00:19:45,891
♪ In heav'n the bells are ringing ♪

444
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:47,726
♪ Ding, dong, verily the sky ♪

445

446
00:19:50,264 --> 00:19:52,765
I can't believe I've lived
in Atlanta all my life

447
00:19:52,767 --> 00:19:53,832
and never done this.

448
00:19:53,834 --> 00:19:56,401
Hey. Here's to new traditions.

449
00:19:57,492 --> 00:19:59,805
Just so you know,
I may have to bow out early.

450
00:19:59,807 --> 00:20:01,340
Long-standing plans.

451
00:20:01,342 --> 00:20:03,275
Uh-huh.

452
00:20:03,277 --> 00:20:05,677
So, where do you watch from?

453
00:20:07,114 --> 00:20:09,281
I know the perfect spot.

454
00:20:14,855 --> 00:20:16,321
What did I tell you?

455
00:20:16,323 --> 00:20:17,956
Best view in town.

456
00:20:17,958 --> 00:20:19,725
You're right.

457
00:20:19,727 --> 00:20:21,693
Pretty girl,

458
00:20:21,695 --> 00:20:23,629
drink in hand,

459
00:20:23,631 --> 00:20:25,464
the city at our feet.

460
00:20:34,651 --> 00:20:35,474
Oh, my God,

461
00:20:35,476 --> 00:20:36,676
are you kidding me?

462
00:20:36,695 --> 00:20:38,377
What happened to setting boundaries?

463
00:20:38,379 --> 00:20:39,778
I didn't bring her up here.
She brought me.

464
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,113
And I'm supposed to believe that?

465
00:20:41,115 --> 00:20:42,848
Well, considering that
she works downstairs, yes.

466
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:44,783
- What was I supposed to say?
- Wait what are you telling me?

467
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:46,652
That you two used to do what
we were just doing up here?

468
00:20:46,654 --> 00:20:48,821
Every year before the tree lighting.

469
00:20:48,823 --> 00:20:51,190
I've marked my territory
all over this roof.

470
00:20:51,192 --> 00:20:53,292
Is that why you brought him up here?

471
00:20:53,294 --> 00:20:55,160
- No.
- W-Why do you care?

472
00:20:55,162 --> 00:20:56,895
Uh, Kori, it doesn't mean anything.

473
00:20:58,165 --> 00:20:59,364
Your new bae's right.

474
00:20:59,366 --> 00:21:01,066
It doesn't mean anything.

475
00:21:01,068 --> 00:21:02,839
Clearly nothing is sacred.

476
00:21:02,874 --> 00:21:05,404
I was wrong to come up here.

477
00:21:06,234 --> 00:21:07,906
Monica told me to close the door on you.

478
00:21:07,908 --> 00:21:09,208
Fallon!

479
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:10,876
So I'm closing the door!

480
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:21,213
You can't punish the guy
for trying to move on.

481
00:21:21,215 --> 00:21:22,614
You weren't even interested in Culhane

482
00:21:22,616 --> 00:21:24,216
when you had him wrapped
around your finger.

483
00:21:24,218 --> 00:21:25,784
That's why I introduced him to Kori.

484
00:21:26,721 --> 00:21:28,220
Wait,<i> you</i> introduced them?

485
00:21:29,047 --> 00:21:29,822
That night at the club.

486
00:21:29,824 --> 00:21:31,056
So this is all your fault.

487
00:21:31,058 --> 00:21:33,525
If you have to blame someone, then yeah.

488
00:21:33,527 --> 00:21:35,127
I was just trying to push him away.

489
00:21:35,129 --> 00:21:36,829
What do you have against Culhane?

490
00:21:36,831 --> 00:21:39,331
I'm talking about you, Fallon.

491
00:21:40,668 --> 00:21:41,867
I like you.

492
00:21:42,782 --> 00:21:44,670
But you're seeing someone.

493
00:21:44,672 --> 00:21:46,271
Monica told me you
lied about the Bahamas

494
00:21:46,273 --> 00:21:47,473
because you were with someone.

495
00:21:47,475 --> 00:21:48,874
Since being unavailable

496
00:21:48,876 --> 00:21:51,243
seems to be the only thing
that gets your attention,

497
00:21:51,245 --> 00:21:53,912
then yeah. I was with someone.

498
00:21:54,771 --> 00:21:55,798
And she was hot.

499
00:21:56,824 --> 00:21:58,000
But she wasn't you.

500
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:02,504
<i>Hi. I have a vendor</i>

501
00:22:02,506 --> 00:22:05,040
who's requested advanced payment.

502
00:22:05,042 --> 00:22:06,942
I'm sure accounting is swamped,

503
00:22:06,944 --> 00:22:10,813
but how long would it
take to get $300,000?

504
00:22:10,815 --> 00:22:12,948
In cash.

505
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:15,701
Oh. That is a while.

506
00:22:15,703 --> 00:22:17,669
Uh, never mind.

507
00:22:17,671 --> 00:22:20,122
I'll figure it out. Hey.

508
00:22:20,124 --> 00:22:22,191
I was just about to come get you.

509
00:22:22,193 --> 00:22:23,659
We were supposed to leave
for the tree lighting

510
00:22:23,661 --> 00:22:26,495
- 20 minutes ago.
- City can wait.

511
00:22:26,497 --> 00:22:29,498
Our progeny, on the other hand...

512
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:32,167
Actually...

513
00:22:32,169 --> 00:22:34,236
I'm not really feeling up to it.

514
00:22:34,238 --> 00:22:36,171
Do you think you could be pregnant?

515
00:22:36,173 --> 00:22:38,307
No. That would be fast.

516
00:22:38,309 --> 00:22:40,415
Yeah, fast, but not impossible.

517
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:42,878
Either way, we should make
sure that you're all right.

518
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,313
Our family doctor's the best.

519
00:22:44,315 --> 00:22:46,181
He brought both of my
kids into the world.

520
00:22:46,183 --> 00:22:48,016
We'll have Anders set up the details.

521
00:22:48,018 --> 00:22:49,451
Let's talk about it later.

522
00:22:49,453 --> 00:22:50,519
We're so late.

523
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:02,698
Excuse me.

524
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,466
Hey, have you seen Blake?

525
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:07,319
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

526
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,188
What the hell are you doing here?

527
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:11,190
- This area's for business clients.
- And I'm here

528
00:23:11,192 --> 00:23:13,025
to deliver C.A.'s Christmas presents.

529
00:23:13,027 --> 00:23:14,626
Call me Sammy Claus.

530
00:23:14,628 --> 00:23:16,628
I have already handled the presents.

531
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:18,096
No, no, no, no. You mean that...

532
00:23:18,098 --> 00:23:19,364
old white dude care package

533
00:23:19,366 --> 00:23:21,066
you and your dad have been
giving out for centuries?

534
00:23:21,068 --> 00:23:23,735
I have something better
than scotch and cigars.

535
00:23:23,737 --> 00:23:25,571
The Google Pixel.

536
00:23:25,573 --> 00:23:27,139
Morell Corp. was very interested,

537
00:23:27,141 --> 00:23:28,373
so I poached their idea

538
00:23:28,375 --> 00:23:30,142
on behalf of Carrington Atlantic.

539
00:23:31,177 --> 00:23:32,673
Not bad, Sammy.

540
00:23:35,249 --> 00:23:37,115
I procured the money.

541
00:23:38,619 --> 00:23:39,651
For the fish.

542
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:41,753
You're gonna help me?

543
00:23:41,755 --> 00:23:43,088
Oh, my God, Anders.

544
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:44,523
I could hug you right now.

545
00:23:44,525 --> 00:23:46,558
Oh, that won't be necessary.

546
00:23:47,219 --> 00:23:47,926
Not ever.

547
00:23:48,509 --> 00:23:50,929
But I will accompany you
to the drop-off, though.

548
00:23:51,788 --> 00:23:53,865
It is my duty to protect this family...

549
00:23:53,867 --> 00:23:56,235
and those that I can no longer pretend

550
00:23:56,237 --> 00:23:57,836
aren't part of the family.

551
00:23:58,563 --> 00:24:00,439
<i>These are amazing.</i>

552
00:24:00,441 --> 00:24:01,873
Just for you.

553
00:24:01,875 --> 00:24:03,175
Handpicked by Santa.

554
00:24:04,459 --> 00:24:05,711
Santa's going down.

555
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:09,248
- What you got there, Sam?
- Oh, it's, uh,

556
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:11,149
Carrington Atlantic's client gift:

557
00:24:11,151 --> 00:24:12,451
the new Google Pixel.

558
00:24:13,274 --> 00:24:14,403
Something everyone wants.

559
00:24:14,405 --> 00:24:16,688
Wow. Great idea.
I wish I'd thought of it.

560
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:17,756
I hope you're not too upset

561
00:24:17,758 --> 00:24:19,057
I snatched them out from under you.

562
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,493
But I doubt anyone will mind

563
00:24:21,495 --> 00:24:22,661
you forgot to get them anything.

564
00:24:22,663 --> 00:24:24,129
Don't beat yourself up about it.

565
00:24:24,131 --> 00:24:25,347
Oh, I don't know
what you're talking about.

566
00:24:25,349 --> 00:24:26,515
Those are from me.

567
00:24:26,517 --> 00:24:27,916
No, they're from Blake.

568
00:24:27,918 --> 00:24:30,319
I had them add a personalized
note to each bag.

569
00:24:30,321 --> 00:24:31,687
- Did you?
- Mm-hmm.

570
00:24:31,689 --> 00:24:32,988
Well, read it.

571
00:24:39,363 --> 00:24:41,296
"Wishing you a Morell Christmas"?

572
00:24:42,546 --> 00:24:43,332
This is not right.

573
00:24:43,334 --> 00:24:44,666
I put in the order myself.

574
00:24:44,668 --> 00:24:46,501
See, my contact called me

575
00:24:46,503 --> 00:24:48,036
after you called them,

576
00:24:48,038 --> 00:24:49,071
so I had them adjust the order.

577
00:24:49,073 --> 00:24:50,806
Same "To", different "From".

578
00:24:50,808 --> 00:24:52,941
But thank you for
handing them out for me.

579
00:24:52,943 --> 00:24:54,242
Ho ho ho.

580
00:25:01,984 --> 00:25:04,303
I hope you all
are having a wonderful evening.

581
00:25:04,305 --> 00:25:05,904
On behalf of Carrington Atlantic,

582
00:25:05,906 --> 00:25:08,457
it is an honor to be
hosting the lighting

583
00:25:08,459 --> 00:25:11,725
of this city's beautiful Christmas tree.

584
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,478
Of course, none of this could happen

585
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:16,198
if it wasn't for Atlanta's
terrific city council.

586
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,216
I'd like to introduce council members

587
00:25:18,218 --> 00:25:19,751
Maya Anshiri,

588
00:25:19,753 --> 00:25:21,003
District 6;

589
00:25:21,923 --> 00:25:22,838
Sarah Belson,

590
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:25,040
- District 2;
- Isn't Kori supposed to be up there?

591
00:25:25,042 --> 00:25:27,709
- Chris Pfeiffer, District 13;
- She's not gonna make it tonight.

592
00:25:27,711 --> 00:25:29,995
And Kori Rucks, District 10.

593
00:25:29,997 --> 00:25:31,997
What are you getting ready to do?

594
00:25:31,999 --> 00:25:35,167
I know you, and I know
you get off on destruction,

595
00:25:35,169 --> 00:25:36,902
but that girl is not the problem here.

596
00:25:36,904 --> 00:25:38,370
Councilwoman Kori Rucks?

597
00:25:39,907 --> 00:25:42,074
I know. I am.

598
00:25:42,076 --> 00:25:43,241
I'm not proud,

599
00:25:43,243 --> 00:25:46,044
but I am ready to let him go.

600
00:25:48,754 --> 00:25:51,116
Uh, so...

601
00:25:51,118 --> 00:25:53,318
Kori couldn't be here tonight.

602
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,786
I know she really wanted to be,

603
00:25:54,788 --> 00:25:56,421
but...

604
00:25:56,423 --> 00:25:58,357
while I was visiting Kori at work,

605
00:25:58,359 --> 00:26:01,293
I heard that there was
an energy budget crisis,

606
00:26:01,295 --> 00:26:03,128
and so all the public libraries

607
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:05,063
will be shutting down for the holidays.

608
00:26:05,065 --> 00:26:07,199
Wanting to help out my friend,

609
00:26:07,201 --> 00:26:10,202
I convinced my dad to sponsor
the lighting of the libraries

610
00:26:10,204 --> 00:26:12,137
not just for the month of December,

611
00:26:12,139 --> 00:26:13,705
but for the next five years.

612
00:26:13,707 --> 00:26:15,540
So, on behalf of Kori

613
00:26:15,542 --> 00:26:18,143
and the Carrington Atlantic clients,

614
00:26:18,145 --> 00:26:21,146
let's give him a big hand.

615
00:26:22,883 --> 00:26:25,317
This is going to put a serious dent

616
00:26:25,319 --> 00:26:26,651
in company finances.

617
00:26:26,653 --> 00:26:29,554
Being nice hurts, doesn't it?

618
00:26:29,556 --> 00:26:31,957
All right,
let's get this tree lit, shall we?

619
00:26:31,959 --> 00:26:34,226
Merry Christmas, ATL.

620
00:26:43,353 --> 00:26:45,454
So, I could be wrong,

621
00:26:45,456 --> 00:26:47,472
but there are two people
stuck up on the roof,

622
00:26:47,474 --> 00:26:50,041
and those may or may not be
their clothes in the bushes.

623
00:26:50,043 --> 00:26:51,443
So maybe you can help them out

624
00:26:51,445 --> 00:26:53,328
- if you're feeling in the holiday spirit.
- Hmm.

625
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:54,963
I know I am.

626
00:27:14,394 --> 00:27:15,083
Where's your father?

627
00:27:15,085 --> 00:27:17,152
Actually,
I'm the one who called you here.

628
00:27:17,154 --> 00:27:18,186
And what do you want?

629
00:27:18,188 --> 00:27:19,921
To apologize.

630
00:27:19,923 --> 00:27:21,690
I've restored the Carrington
Foundation funding

631
00:27:21,692 --> 00:27:22,958
to your favorite charity.

632
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,761
I can't imagine you
called me all the way here

633
00:27:25,763 --> 00:27:28,730
to say that I'm back on the payroll.

634
00:27:28,732 --> 00:27:30,332
I need to know that we're good.

635
00:27:31,187 --> 00:27:32,801
My father reminded me

636
00:27:32,803 --> 00:27:34,536
how much I've taken for granted

637
00:27:34,538 --> 00:27:36,872
and how much we owe you.

638
00:27:36,874 --> 00:27:38,890
Willy Miller, for example.

639
00:27:38,925 --> 00:27:40,942
When I was being investigated,

640
00:27:40,944 --> 00:27:42,811
I knew I didn't do it,
but that doesn't always matter.

641
00:27:42,813 --> 00:27:44,479
You delivered the perfect suspect

642
00:27:44,481 --> 00:27:46,081
and buried everything along with Willy.

643
00:27:46,083 --> 00:27:49,684
And then when Claudia came
out as the real killer,

644
00:27:49,686 --> 00:27:53,588
you locked her in an institution
to protect the cover-up.

645
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:55,757
I don't know anything about that.

646
00:27:55,759 --> 00:27:58,660
But it does remind me
of another cover-up.

647
00:27:59,563 --> 00:28:01,830
This particular case had to do with, uh,

648
00:28:02,438 --> 00:28:05,300
an oil rig worker who died in the field.

649
00:28:05,302 --> 00:28:08,303
Nothing too unusual, except that the...

650
00:28:08,305 --> 00:28:11,039
faulty rig had just been inspected.

651
00:28:11,041 --> 00:28:12,874
Signed off on by some...

652
00:28:12,876 --> 00:28:15,510
inexperienced, unqualified kid.

653
00:28:16,469 --> 00:28:18,547
What? When was this?

654
00:28:18,549 --> 00:28:20,315
A few years back, I think.

655
00:28:20,317 --> 00:28:22,017
I mean, surely you heard about it.

656
00:28:22,019 --> 00:28:24,486
The guy fell and snapped his neck

657
00:28:24,488 --> 00:28:26,354
and died instantly.

658
00:28:26,356 --> 00:28:28,089
Now, luckily for Carrington Atlantic,

659
00:28:28,091 --> 00:28:30,525
the idiotic inspector

660
00:28:30,527 --> 00:28:33,161
was the boss's son.

661
00:28:34,624 --> 00:28:37,132
Now, I guess you can guess
what happened next.

662
00:28:37,134 --> 00:28:41,403
His daddy paid his best
field engineer, Blaisdel,

663
00:28:41,405 --> 00:28:44,005
to bury the truth.

664
00:28:44,007 --> 00:28:48,877
All so you could keep living
in your sanctimonious bubble.

665
00:28:48,879 --> 00:28:50,745
I don't...

666
00:28:50,747 --> 00:28:52,180
I don't believe you.

667
00:28:52,182 --> 00:28:53,481
Why do you think your father

668
00:28:53,483 --> 00:28:56,218
wanted Blaisdel's phone from evidence?

669
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:59,020
Because he had proof of what you did.

670
00:28:59,022 --> 00:29:00,589
Your daddy was covering up

671
00:29:00,591 --> 00:29:02,090
your mess.

672
00:29:06,797 --> 00:29:08,496
Blake...

673
00:29:08,498 --> 00:29:10,966
He didn't want me to tell you.

674
00:29:12,903 --> 00:29:15,971
But I did warn him
there'd be ramifications.

675
00:29:20,268 --> 00:29:21,142
What can I say?

676
00:29:21,144 --> 00:29:23,278
Not my first rodeo.

677
00:29:32,589 --> 00:29:33,989
I heard everything.

678
00:29:34,742 --> 00:29:35,523
You okay?

679
00:29:37,261 --> 00:29:38,660
Don't worry.

680
00:29:38,662 --> 00:29:39,995
We'll find another way.

681
00:29:39,997 --> 00:29:42,297
No, we won't.

682
00:29:42,299 --> 00:29:44,633
Just delete that recording.

683
00:29:51,025 --> 00:29:53,899
Come on, Kori.
I don't know what else to do.

684
00:29:53,901 --> 00:29:55,500
Neither do I.

685
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:58,136
Your ex-booty call
just went psycho on us.

686
00:29:59,306 --> 00:30:00,772
Building security saw me naked.

687
00:30:01,896 --> 00:30:03,408
She did solve your budget crisis.

688
00:30:03,410 --> 00:30:06,011
Are you defending her right now?

689
00:30:06,013 --> 00:30:08,280
Why didn't you tell me
that was your spot, anyway?

690
00:30:08,282 --> 00:30:09,948
Because it didn't matter.

691
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:11,850
I thought it was a good view.

692
00:30:11,852 --> 00:30:13,719
- I wasn't thinking.
- Or you were thinking about her.

693
00:30:14,509 --> 00:30:16,321
That's not...

694
00:30:19,615 --> 00:30:23,028
- I've apologized a thousand times.
- Apologies don't mean much

695
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:24,963
if you can't change
what you're sorry for.

696
00:30:26,233 --> 00:30:28,634
I'm crazy about you, Michael.

697
00:30:30,037 --> 00:30:32,371
But I am not crazy enough
to put up with your ex

698
00:30:32,373 --> 00:30:34,106
or your feelings for her.

699
00:30:37,211 --> 00:30:39,978
I'm done.

700
00:30:54,962 --> 00:30:56,995
Do you think that's necessary?

701
00:30:56,997 --> 00:30:59,564
I like to be prepared.

702
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:02,834
I wasn't always a majordomo.

703
00:31:03,572 --> 00:31:05,396
The price of your freedom.

704
00:31:56,226 --> 00:31:57,022
Morning, Chief.

705
00:31:57,024 --> 00:31:59,754
Mr. Colby. What are you doing here?

706
00:31:59,789 --> 00:32:01,893
Why do you think
your father wanted Blaisdel...

707
00:32:01,895 --> 00:32:04,162
Just listening to the news.

708
00:32:04,164 --> 00:32:08,066
Some cop talking about taking
bribes and mishandling evidence.

709
00:32:12,539 --> 00:32:14,473
Blake would be implicated, too.

710
00:32:14,475 --> 00:32:17,142
He won't let that recording go public.

711
00:32:17,144 --> 00:32:19,177
And that's what I love
about my relationship

712
00:32:19,179 --> 00:32:23,181
with the Carringtons:
mutually assured destruction.

713
00:32:23,183 --> 00:32:24,883
Not a very healthy relationship.

714
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:28,286
I own a place in the Bahamas.

715
00:32:28,288 --> 00:32:30,389
White sand, turquoise waters.

716
00:32:30,391 --> 00:32:32,057
It's a damn tropical paradise.

717
00:32:32,059 --> 00:32:35,761
I'll give you the house,
and throw in $5 million.

718
00:32:35,763 --> 00:32:39,564
Are you trying to buy
me over to your side?

719
00:32:39,566 --> 00:32:40,766
Trying to buy your freedom.

720
00:32:40,768 --> 00:32:42,768
Clearly,
you've forgotten the value of it,

721
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:44,636
or you wouldn't have taken
a gig as an errand boy

722
00:32:44,638 --> 00:32:47,239
for some corrupt and
unremarkable white man.

723
00:32:47,241 --> 00:32:48,340
Don't talk to me like that.

724
00:32:48,342 --> 00:32:50,008
You don't know what it's like.

725
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:51,676
We can't all be overnight billionaires.

726
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:55,180
Before I was rich, I was just a kid...

727
00:32:55,182 --> 00:32:56,715
who looked up to you.

728
00:32:56,717 --> 00:32:58,617
I'd see you on the news,

729
00:32:58,619 --> 00:33:01,219
taking down bad guys,
taking care of people.

730
00:33:01,221 --> 00:33:03,021
My daddy couldn't get it together,

731
00:33:03,023 --> 00:33:05,424
but you showed me it was possible to,

732
00:33:05,426 --> 00:33:07,692
in a world where we have
to work twice as hard

733
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:09,394
to get half as far.

734
00:33:10,564 --> 00:33:13,064
I'm giving you a chance
to get it together again.

735
00:33:14,198 --> 00:33:15,734
So what's in it for you?

736
00:33:15,736 --> 00:33:18,637
You leave Atlanta without
hurting anybody else.

737
00:33:18,639 --> 00:33:20,705
Take an early retirement.

738
00:33:20,707 --> 00:33:23,708
And name Bobbi Colby
as your replacement.

739
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:25,477
My cousin, a good cop.

740
00:33:25,479 --> 00:33:28,313
Someone who deserves the job.

741
00:33:28,315 --> 00:33:30,415
Someone Blake can't get to.

742
00:33:37,036 --> 00:33:37,956
<i>You made the front page</i>

743
00:33:37,958 --> 00:33:39,791
with your charitable move last night,

744
00:33:39,793 --> 00:33:42,027
the donation to the libraries.

745
00:33:43,227 --> 00:33:44,729
You mean your charitable move?

746
00:33:44,731 --> 00:33:46,431
And you didn't have to do a thing.

747
00:33:46,433 --> 00:33:47,699
It's true what they say,

748
00:33:47,701 --> 00:33:49,367
the best things in life are free.

749
00:33:50,139 --> 00:33:51,937
Or some other such
misguided phrase designed

750
00:33:51,939 --> 00:33:54,272
to placate those who are not rich.

751
00:33:56,743 --> 00:33:58,910
I've tried biting my tongue lately,

752
00:33:58,912 --> 00:34:01,613
letting you make your
mark with Morell Corp.

753
00:34:01,615 --> 00:34:03,982
But the longer you're around Jeff Colby,

754
00:34:03,984 --> 00:34:05,350
the more I worry about you.

755
00:34:05,352 --> 00:34:06,885
You never used to be so selfish.

756
00:34:13,861 --> 00:34:15,393
Come on.

757
00:34:16,697 --> 00:34:18,129
You can't skip breakfast.

758
00:34:18,131 --> 00:34:21,233
I think I'll keep a safe
distance from you, thanks.

759
00:34:21,235 --> 00:34:23,301
You've finally learned you can't
mess with Fallon Carrington.

760
00:34:25,674 --> 00:34:28,273
You've got game, I'll give you that.

761
00:34:28,275 --> 00:34:29,875
If you want to be on my level, though,

762
00:34:29,877 --> 00:34:32,143
you have to put your back into it.

763
00:34:33,016 --> 00:34:34,846
I could teach you a few things.

764
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:44,956
Dr. Hill.

765
00:34:44,958 --> 00:34:47,325
Yes, I'm just following up
on that appointment

766
00:34:47,327 --> 00:34:48,960
of Mrs. Carrington's.

767
00:34:48,962 --> 00:34:52,097
Yeah, fertility counseling.

768
00:34:52,099 --> 00:34:55,909
I'm glad that her records
transferred so promptly.

769
00:34:55,944 --> 00:34:56,835
That's right.

770
00:34:58,306 --> 00:34:59,704
What?

771
00:34:59,706 --> 00:35:01,039
You're absolutely sure?

772
00:35:01,041 --> 00:35:02,340
Thank you.

773
00:35:02,342 --> 00:35:03,675
Sir,

774
00:35:04,808 --> 00:35:06,578
we need to talk about your wife.

775
00:35:13,257 --> 00:35:15,591
Anders, I've been trying to find

776
00:35:15,593 --> 00:35:17,426
a moment alone to thank you

777
00:35:17,428 --> 00:35:19,161
for your help.

778
00:35:19,163 --> 00:35:20,629
I really didn't expect it.

779
00:35:20,631 --> 00:35:21,930
Well, what can I say?

780
00:35:21,932 --> 00:35:23,332
My judgment failed me.

781
00:35:24,212 --> 00:35:26,535
You see, I had your medical records

782
00:35:26,537 --> 00:35:28,403
sent to the family doctor.

783
00:35:28,405 --> 00:35:30,539
He just called.

784
00:35:30,541 --> 00:35:32,107
About your IUD.

785
00:35:33,244 --> 00:35:34,843
What did you tell Blake?

786
00:35:34,845 --> 00:35:37,012
I've told you my position,
and I mean what I say:

787
00:35:37,014 --> 00:35:39,481
I will protect the secrets of your past.

788
00:35:39,483 --> 00:35:42,351
But I won't lie if it
affects his future.

789
00:35:43,130 --> 00:35:44,586
Anders, I'm sorry.

790
00:35:44,588 --> 00:35:46,121
Blake's waiting for you.

791
00:35:52,217 --> 00:35:53,929
You lied to me.

792
00:35:53,931 --> 00:35:55,931
You and Anders accessed
my medical records.

793
00:35:55,933 --> 00:35:57,666
That's a violation of my trust.

794
00:35:57,668 --> 00:36:00,536
You lied about being
ready to start a family.

795
00:36:02,319 --> 00:36:03,839
Do you even want to have kids?

796
00:36:04,749 --> 00:36:06,008
I don't know if I'm ready.

797
00:36:06,010 --> 00:36:07,075
What, because of your career?

798
00:36:07,077 --> 00:36:08,277
You could have just told me.

799
00:36:08,869 --> 00:36:11,013
Because I was pregnant once.

800
00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:18,687
It was back in Venezuela.

801
00:36:18,689 --> 00:36:21,623
I was living with my sister
at the time and her boyfriend.

802
00:36:22,901 --> 00:36:24,827
<i>After the strike, he lost his job,</i>

803
00:36:24,829 --> 00:36:26,328
and the last thing he wanted

804
00:36:26,330 --> 00:36:28,397
was another child to take care of,

805
00:36:28,399 --> 00:36:29,631
especially one that wasn't his.

806
00:36:29,633 --> 00:36:32,334
- <i>I found him taking it out on Iris.</i>
- _

807
00:36:32,336 --> 00:36:34,436
_

808
00:36:34,438 --> 00:36:35,704
<i>So I tried to stop him.</i>

809
00:36:42,725 --> 00:36:44,746
The baby didn't make it.

810
00:36:46,650 --> 00:36:48,750
Oh, my God.

811
00:36:48,752 --> 00:36:51,086
Oh, Cristal.

812
00:36:53,824 --> 00:36:55,324
I'm so sorry.

813
00:36:56,393 --> 00:36:57,626
I love you,

814
00:36:57,628 --> 00:36:59,328
no matter what you've been through.

815
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:04,366
After the miscarriage,
I needed a doctor.

816
00:37:04,368 --> 00:37:05,934
We didn't have any money.

817
00:37:06,996 --> 00:37:09,438
Her boyfriend was working
with some shady people,

818
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,939
<i>but they had cash.</i>

819
00:37:13,244 --> 00:37:14,610
You stole their money?

820
00:37:14,612 --> 00:37:17,613
We didn't know what else to do.

821
00:37:17,615 --> 00:37:20,782
If I had any idea that they
would keep coming after me,

822
00:37:20,784 --> 00:37:22,751
- after all this time...
- Whoa, what do you mean? Are you in danger?

823
00:37:22,753 --> 00:37:24,686
Not anymore.

824
00:37:24,688 --> 00:37:26,722
Anders helped me take care of it.

825
00:37:26,724 --> 00:37:28,657
But please don't blame him.

826
00:37:28,659 --> 00:37:30,158
Why didn't you come to me?

827
00:37:30,922 --> 00:37:33,629
I didn't want to risk losing you

828
00:37:33,631 --> 00:37:36,431
over somebody that I'm not anymore.

829
00:37:37,427 --> 00:37:39,434
Blake, I want this future with you.

830
00:37:39,436 --> 00:37:42,204
I want to be the mother
of your children.

831
00:37:42,206 --> 00:37:44,673
I just didn't think
that I would have kids

832
00:37:44,675 --> 00:37:47,376
after that experience.

833
00:37:47,378 --> 00:37:49,611
And I didn't feel that I could tell you.

834
00:37:49,613 --> 00:37:52,547
I thought that if I pulled
one thread from my past,

835
00:37:52,549 --> 00:37:55,484
that it would all start to unravel.

836
00:37:58,122 --> 00:37:59,821
Emotionally, I mean.

837
00:38:01,258 --> 00:38:02,258
I'm sorry.

838
00:38:03,727 --> 00:38:06,361
About everything you've gone through;
I had no idea.

839
00:38:08,865 --> 00:38:10,232
Where's you sister now?

840
00:38:10,234 --> 00:38:11,466
She's still in Venezuela.

841
00:38:11,468 --> 00:38:13,068
She stayed on the run.

842
00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:14,303
That's why I send her money.

843
00:38:14,305 --> 00:38:16,872
That's why Sam had the house robbed.

844
00:38:16,874 --> 00:38:18,407
But now that I settled the debt,

845
00:38:18,409 --> 00:38:19,908
maybe it'll be over.

846
00:38:20,687 --> 00:38:21,843
We should bring her here.

847
00:38:23,262 --> 00:38:25,948
Oh, Blake, that's very kind, but I...

848
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:27,416
No. I...

849
00:38:27,418 --> 00:38:29,117
I'd like to meet her.

850
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:30,552
You're sisters.

851
00:38:30,554 --> 00:38:32,254
After everything you've been through,

852
00:38:32,256 --> 00:38:34,189
both of you, you should be together...

853
00:38:36,093 --> 00:38:37,526
...for the holidays.

854
00:38:41,498 --> 00:38:42,965
<i>It's done.</i>

855
00:38:42,967 --> 00:38:46,501
Stansfield is on a private plane
to the Bahamas with his family,

856
00:38:46,503 --> 00:38:49,204
and the recording is erased.

857
00:38:49,206 --> 00:38:51,006
Nobody will ever know what happened.

858
00:38:51,008 --> 00:38:52,607
I know.

859
00:38:52,609 --> 00:38:54,409
None of this changes the fact

860
00:38:54,411 --> 00:38:57,646
that I'm responsible for a man's death.

861
00:38:57,648 --> 00:39:01,316
You know Dominic Ortega
was with C.A. for 15 years?

862
00:39:01,318 --> 00:39:03,663
He had a wife, two kids.

863
00:39:03,698 --> 00:39:05,480
You can't change the past.

864
00:39:05,515 --> 00:39:09,091
All you can do is... do better.

865
00:39:09,093 --> 00:39:10,525
And you are.

866
00:39:10,527 --> 00:39:11,793
I'm not sure I am.

867
00:39:11,795 --> 00:39:13,628
But thank you, Jeff.

868
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:15,797
Anytime.

869
00:39:31,281 --> 00:39:32,748
Steven?

870
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:34,216
Ted. Hi.

871
00:39:34,218 --> 00:39:35,851
I'm, uh, surprised to hear from you.

872
00:39:35,853 --> 00:39:37,152
I've been thinking about you...

873
00:39:38,622 --> 00:39:39,821
...a lot.

874
00:39:39,823 --> 00:39:41,790
Me, too. Always.

875
00:39:41,792 --> 00:39:43,458
I'd love to see you.

876
00:39:44,363 --> 00:39:46,228
I'll be in New York in three hours.

877
00:39:55,439 --> 00:39:58,106
- You wanted to see me, sir.
- Yeah.

878
00:39:59,270 --> 00:40:01,543
I'm sure Mrs. Carrington
told you everything.

879
00:40:02,318 --> 00:40:03,078
I'm not.

880
00:40:04,615 --> 00:40:07,082
I need you to find out all
you can about her sister,

881
00:40:07,084 --> 00:40:08,850
Iris Machado.

882
00:40:08,852 --> 00:40:11,520
And then let's bring
her here for Christmas,

883
00:40:11,522 --> 00:40:13,455
so we can ask her ourselves.

884
00:40:20,054 --> 00:40:21,329
I thought you'd be here

885
00:40:21,331 --> 00:40:23,665
burning the midnight oil.

886
00:40:23,667 --> 00:40:25,534
Have to if I'm gonna keep up with you.

887
00:40:27,504 --> 00:40:28,437
What do you need, Fallon?

888
00:40:28,439 --> 00:40:30,439
Just to say I'm sorry.

889
00:40:30,441 --> 00:40:32,107
I don't know why I brought
you up to that roof,

890
00:40:32,109 --> 00:40:34,009
and I don't know why
I had to lie about it.

891
00:40:34,011 --> 00:40:35,877
I do.

892
00:40:35,879 --> 00:40:37,712
You were trying to get over Culhane,

893
00:40:37,714 --> 00:40:39,748
and it was harder than you thought.

894
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:41,650
So you were using me.

895
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:44,753
So use me.

896
00:40:45,622 --> 00:40:46,788
What?

897
00:40:46,790 --> 00:40:48,490
You were with him

898
00:40:48,492 --> 00:40:51,359
'cause it was easy for you, convenient.

899
00:40:51,361 --> 00:40:53,462
You don't have time for
a real relationship.

900
00:40:53,464 --> 00:40:55,063
You're too busy conquering the world.

901
00:40:55,065 --> 00:40:58,066
Where else are you gonna find
someone with your same schedule?

902
00:40:58,068 --> 00:41:00,135
I could fit you in.

903
00:41:01,138 --> 00:41:03,472
If you could fit me.

904
00:41:03,474 --> 00:41:07,075
I'm sorry. You want to be my rebound?

905
00:41:08,164 --> 00:41:09,978
Isn't that why you're here so late?

906
00:41:13,024 --> 00:41:16,251
And didn't you say that we should
keep this strictly business?

907
00:41:16,916 --> 00:41:19,121
We're at work, aren't we?

908
00:41:50,853 --> 00:41:52,853
