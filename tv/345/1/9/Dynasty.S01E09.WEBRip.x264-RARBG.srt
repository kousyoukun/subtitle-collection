[Cristal] I'll handle it. I always do.
I'll get her the money to relocate.

00:00:22,605 --> 00:00:24,899
If anything happens to her,
it's your fault.

5
00:00:24,983 --> 00:00:28,653
I need you to find out all you can
about her sister, Iris Machado.

00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:31,740
You've been trying to get over Culhane.
It was harder than you thought.

00:00:31,823 --> 00:00:34,576
Didn't you say we should
keep this strictly business?

00:00:34,659 --> 00:00:36,077
We're at work, aren't we?

Grandpa?

00:01:44,562 --> 00:01:48,274
Wipe your nose and put on some pants.
I'm taking you home.

[groans]

30
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:55,990
So, did you read our year-end report?

31
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:59,035
I should've learned.

32
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,539
Discussing dividends is your version
of an after-sex cigarette.

33
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:06,960
At least you've moved past the
"this is the last time we do it" speech.

34
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:08,878
No, this really is the last time.

35
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:12,465
I don't want people thinking
we're in business because we share a bed.

36
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:15,635
You mean a couch,
or that desk, or the sink.

37
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:19,472
The only time we leave the office is
to do it on the balcony.

38
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:22,433
Well, had you read the report,
you'd understand why.

39
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:24,185
We're not profitable yet.

40
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:27,313
And this... isn't helping.

41
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:29,065
Isn't it?

42
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:35,780
Mom will be here any minute.
I get to spend the holidays with family.

43
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:38,575
-What, so I'm not family?
-I mean, the two of you.

44
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:41,870
-Aren't you excited to see your sister?
-Of course.

45
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:45,623
Look, I know it's been a long time
but we're Machados,  tia,  okay?

46
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:47,375
We pick up where we left off.

Oh. I thought you were my mom.

00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:56,718
If I'd raised you,
you wouldn't be wearing that shirt.

50
00:02:57,802 --> 00:02:59,971
So, the year-end report.

51
00:03:00,054 --> 00:03:02,432
You know we're a first year company.

52
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:04,392
We're expected to end in the red.

53
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:06,769

[cell phone chimes]

00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:14,027
What's wrong?
Did Barneys run out of turtlenecks again?

56
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:17,030
Monica. She's bailing on me for Christmas.

57
00:03:17,113 --> 00:03:21,075
Only fair, after you ditched her
on Thanksgiving for that mystery woman.

58
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:24,537
So, who was she? Name, age, weight.

59
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:28,541
Come on. You know my past.
Why can't I know yours?

60
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,127
There was never another woman.

61
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,922
I was visiting my dad in prison.

62
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:38,635
-I thought you cut ties with him.
-I'm trying to sew them back.

63
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:42,472
And because of that,
Monica's giving me the cold shoulder.

64
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:43,473
Well...

65
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:47,852
I'm sorry to hear that.
I hope she'll come around.

66
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:50,563
It's as likely as
you getting us out of the red.

-Welcome wagon, actually.
-Not for you.

Thank God. I was afraid
I'd have to act grateful.

00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:16,256
My sister's on her way.

Are you kidding me?

00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:29,560
I'm sorry to disappoint.

81
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:32,230

this is who you're waiting for.

So, this is where you live, huh?

Well, the ride up the driveway
was longer than my flight.

86
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:56,587

Thank you so much for everything:

the invitation, those little sandwiches
on your fancy plane.

00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:10,643

93

I can only imagine.

00:05:12,895 --> 00:05:13,813
Oh.

95
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:15,982
Must be nice having
your mom for Christmas.

96
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:19,068
-Best gift anyone can give is family.
-Yes.

97
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:22,071
Other than a trust fund
and personal space.

98
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:25,700
Okay, Google.
How do I say "space" in Spanish?

99
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:27,702
Okay, we got it.

100
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:30,997
Follow me, I've had
Mrs. Gunnerson arrange lunch.

101

Double helpings in case
mother eats like son.

102
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:39,172
-Have you hidden the silverware?
-All locked away.

103
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:40,965
Ho, ho, ho.

104
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:42,884
-Dad?
-Grandpa?

105
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:44,218
I come bearing gifts.

106
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:49,682
At least I'm returning one.
It's the thought that counts, right?

107
00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:51,851

How was New York? Any good meetings?

00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:58,524
I'm sure Grandpa will fill you in.

He's exhausted from his little jaunt.

112

-Am I in the right house?
-If I'd known you were coming--

114
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:13,623
You would've hidden the undocumented?

115
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:16,584

00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:19,003
-[Thomas] Thank you.
-This is my wife, Cristal.

117
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:21,798
If you'd come to the wedding,
you would've met her.

118
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:25,009
I did come to your wedding,
the one that wasn't for a green card.

119
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:28,846
Okay. Let's get lunch started, shall we?

00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:32,475
-How's my favorite grandchild?
-Busy building an empire.

121

-That's my girl.
-My girl.

122
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,063
She was your girl
until you let her leave my company.

123
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:38,397
Actually, my company.

124
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:40,191
I'm glad you're here, Grandpa.

125
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:41,776
Thank you.

126
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:45,571
We need to talk.

127
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:58,501
Oh, son of a bitch.

128
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:00,002
Is that cocaine?

129
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:03,297
Your boy was humping
everyone in New York City.

130
00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:07,218
Save the Statue of Liberty,
but I bet if she wore pants...

131
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:10,513
-You're spying on my family?
-The tabloids are.

132
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:14,434
My contact reached out,
and I paid to have it killed.

133
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:18,354
I can't imagine what another scandal
would do to Carrington Atlantic.

134
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:23,734
A company that I handed you because
I thought you were ready to lead it.

135
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:26,195
I have been running a tight ship
for a long time.

136
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:28,656
And what ship would that be?
The  Titanic?

137
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,118
You have a new COO
who shared her bits in public.

138
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:35,621
You were in the middle
of a murder investigation.

139
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:38,583
And you lost my granddaughter
to Jeff Colby.

140
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:41,961
And now your son
is a drug-addicted liability.

141
00:07:44,922 --> 00:07:48,050
-I want you to fire Steven.
-How is that gonna help?

142
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:52,054
If he's gonna get caught, he won't get
caught as head of Carrington Foundation.

143
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:56,809
I'm not firing my son. I'll handle him
in my own way, like a father would,

144
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:58,561
not that you would know.

145
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:02,398
Well, I'm sorry that
you thought that was a suggestion.

146
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,275
I want you to fire Steven.

147
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:08,738
And if you don't, I'll contact the board
and have them fire you.

148
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:21,417
Dad, I'm sorry.

149
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:25,213
No one is more embarrassed
or concerned than I am.

150
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:30,718
It was a slip, and I am ready to forget
all about New York and just focus on work.

151
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:33,429
That's not what I want.

152
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:39,268
I don't want you to forget.
I want you to get help.

153
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:41,646
What, like rehab?

154
00:08:42,396 --> 00:08:47,109
Fine, yes, I will go if that's
what it'll take for you to trust me again.

155
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,111
It's a start.

156
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:53,991
-Join your grandfather and me downstairs.
-You're on your own.

Frank, hi. I'm expecting someone at the
west gate. Ring me when they get here.

[cell phone rings]

160
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:22,478
-You saw my budget proposal?
-This isn't a proposal, it's a bloodbath.

161
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:25,731
I'm not laying off two-thirds
of my people before Christmas.

162
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:28,484
-We can wait until the 26th.
-I'm serious.

163
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:29,735
Well, so am I.

164
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:32,989
I'm trimming the fat.
We have a balance sheet to consider.

165

-Scrooge would've done it.
-You missed the point of that story.

166
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:40,454
No company of mine will ever put
profits over people. End of discussion.

167
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:44,292
Bah, humbug. But don't worry.
I'm working on another angle.

168
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:58,598
The Carringtons do
keep you around the clock.

169
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:01,183
Well, the end of the year bonus
is worth it.

170
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:04,478
Am I driving you and Fallon?
She didn't tell me about that.

171
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:07,565
Well, that makes two of us.
She was taking me shopping.

172
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:11,819
Kori told me about your breakup.
I'm sorry to hear it.

173
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:14,405
-It's my fault.
-I thought it was Fallon's.

174
00:10:14,488 --> 00:10:17,658
-Mm. I make my own choices.
-Does Fallon know that?

175
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:19,076
[chuckles]

176
00:10:20,244 --> 00:10:21,537
I'm driving myself today.

177
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:24,123
That way you won't be stuck with us
if I take too long.

178
00:10:24,206 --> 00:10:25,333
You're too kind.

179
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:30,004
I can even get my own door.

180
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:37,928
Not sure where his holiday spirit is.
It's not like he's lonely.

181
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:40,181
Are you?

182
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:42,516
I'm fine.

183
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:43,684
I'm evolving.

184
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,561
That's mature.

185
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:47,938
It's a pain in the ass.

186
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:59,075
I bet you're thinking,
"It could've been me."

187
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:07,291
So, Iris, Cristal tells me it's been
12 years since you've seen each other?

188
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:09,460
Six since I've seen my boy.

189
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:12,254
I couldn't manage
being away from my kids that long.

190
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:13,506
You do what it takes.

191
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:15,800
Actually, Thomas, I regret it.

192
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:19,345
I regret every day that
I wasn't around to see...

193
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:24,100
my son become this
amazing, beautiful young man.

194
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:26,602
Oh, stop it. But, like, don't.

195
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:30,689
I won't make that mistake again.
I want to stay in America.

196
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:31,857
-What?
-What?

197
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:35,319
Maybe I'll apply at Carrington Atlantic.

198
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:39,031
Smart move.
I hear they're taking anyone these days.

199
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:40,825
I'm hoping you have some pull.

200
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:45,913
I could move here on a work visa,
stop depending on Cristal's money

201
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:49,208
and your kindness, Blake.
I work hard for what I have.

202
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:52,711
I can type. I'm good on the phone.

203
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:55,965
Anyway, it's just an idea.

204
00:11:56,048 --> 00:12:00,094
Not that you've given it
a lot of thought, obviously.

205
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:01,971
I'd have to run it by the COO.

206
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:08,227
I can't do it.
I can't believe you lied to me.

207
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:10,896
I know.
No one should ever lie about shopping.

208
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:14,150
If you had time to think,
you wouldn't come.

209
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:16,735
-I'm barely here now.
-Well, you have to stay.

210
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:19,321
-I called up ahead to set up a visit.
-Fallon.

211
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:21,991
When I saw Cristal
and her Sears catalog family,

212
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:24,076
they seemed so happy to be reunited.

213
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,329
Jeff was crushed when he heard
you were bailing on Christmas.

214
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:30,416
I can't believe Jeff told you.
That wasn't his decision.

215
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:31,500
Don't be mad.

216
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:34,753
When my dad shut me out
for a week, I couldn't stand it.

217
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:38,632
-I can't imagine losing him for ten years.
-Right. You can't imagine.

218
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:40,718
[boy crying]

219
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:42,011
-Mommy.
-[door buzzes]

220
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:45,431
-[door opens]
-Prisoner 2F529. Ready for you.

221
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:51,937
Look. This was your idea.
You go see the bastard yourself. I'm out.

222
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:01,447
[knocking on door]

223
00:13:05,784 --> 00:13:08,787
-Did anyone see you come in?
-Just Frank at the gate.

224
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:12,541
He's an old friend and my drug hook-up.
So, his lips are sealed.

225
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:16,879
So, where we going?

226
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:20,049
Betty Ford, allegedly.

227
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:22,218
But pick a place on Earth

228
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:23,761
and that's where we'll be.

229
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:26,055
My friend offered us his plane.

230
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:28,849
We won't have to deal with
security or my father.

231
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:31,268
Paris for New Years?

232
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:32,895
[door buzzes]

233
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:45,032
[man] B lock seven.

234
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:46,116
[door buzzes, then opens]

235
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:55,918
Not every day some
Buckhead Betty rolls up in here.

236
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:57,836
Are you lonely, honey?

237
00:13:58,295 --> 00:14:02,675
Sorry to disappoint. I'm not one of those
nutjobs who falls for guys in prison.

238
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:06,220
Cute jacket.

239
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:10,391
-Mind me telling me what this is about?
-I'm a friend of Jeff and Monica's.

240
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:13,227
-She was coming to visit you today.
-Why?

241
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:16,313
-She is your daughter.
-She's not welcome.

242
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:22,736
People say I'm the one that
convinced Chelsea and Ivanka to make up.

243
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:25,114
I can negotiate a treaty
between you two.

244
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:28,576
-Sorry. Who are you?
-I'm her friend Fallon Carrington.

245
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:33,163
-You're Blake's daughter.
-No, he's my father.

246
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:35,749
-I've known Jeff and Monica since--
-[Cecil] Get out.

247
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:37,793
Get the hell out.

248
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:40,087
Get out of here. Never come back again.

249
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:42,172
And stay away from my kids!

250
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:44,800
[door slams]

251
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:55,269
[speaking in Spanish]

252
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:02,318
You have to see this, an album my mom
brought when you were kids.

253
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:04,945
-I can't believe you have these.
-[Cristal] Why do that?

254
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:07,823
Asking Blake for a job? How could you?

255
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,700
I didn't ask him for your job.

256
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:12,369
You couldn't do my job or any job.

257
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:14,288
As if you know anything about me.

258
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:18,876
After you left, you barely looked back.
You don't know what I did for money.

259
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,337
I can handle a simple secretary job.

260
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,923
-Secretarial.
-Oh, my God, who cares?

261
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:26,133
If she got work, she could stay.

262
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:27,676
-No, she can't.
-[Sam] Why?

263
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,555
We got her here. She's been on the
run for 12 years for money you both stole.

264
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:35,434
-Look at the life you got.
-I can't go back to Venezuela.

265
00:15:35,517 --> 00:15:36,644
I can't.

266
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:39,813
I just wanna start over like you did.

267
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:42,066
Here with my son.

268
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:44,735
Why is that so hard for you to understand?

269
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:49,949
She doesn't want your life.
She just wants us.

270
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,212
Have you handled Steven?

271
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:05,464
Time is crucial, son.

272
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:09,760
We can bury the news during the
holiday season when the news slows down.

273
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:11,220
That won't be necessary.

274
00:16:12,012 --> 00:16:15,683
He slipped. He knows he's wrong.
He assured me he'll go to rehab.

275
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:17,685
I didn't raise you to be a fool.

276
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:22,815
And you didn't raise my son. I know him.

277
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:25,567
I know how to get through to him.
He understands.

278
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:28,862
Believe it or not,
it'll work better than your approach.

279
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:30,447
-You'll see.
-Really?

280
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:32,366
Nobody has to be fired.

281
00:16:37,871 --> 00:16:40,749
Tell that to the Ken doll
sneaking out of the east wing.

282
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:54,596
Something wrong with the front door?
It was you, wasn't it?

283
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,850
-You dragged him to New York.
-Steven came to me.

284
00:16:57,933 --> 00:16:59,852
He doesn't do anything he doesn't--

285
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:03,981
This wouldn't have happened if you
hadn't come back. What's it gonna be?

286
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:06,442
Will 50 grand do it this time?

287
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:09,153
There's the Blake Carrington I know.

288
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:11,864
He doesn't get his way,
throws money at the problem.

289
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:14,366
You know,
how about that or this golf club?

290
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:15,659
You pick.

291
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:20,456
Mr. Carrington... you know what
the first step of rehab is?

292
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:24,043
It's finally admitting
that you're powerless.

293
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:31,759
[laughs]

294
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:36,847
-[Monica] You told Fallon?
-What are you talking about?

295
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:40,934
Your partner took me on a field trip
to Atlanta North State Correctional.

296
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:43,687
You know how messed up
things are between Dad and me.

297
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:45,564
I don't want that out
in the world.

298
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:48,776
I didn't tell the world,
and I wasn't trying to hurt you.

299
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:52,071
Fallon was asking me.
She thought I was with some girl.

300
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:53,447
Who cares?

301
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:58,452
-My God. You're sleeping with her?
-I have bad news.

302
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:02,206
Looks like you already know it.

303
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:05,751
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to
put you in an awkward position.

304
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:08,087
Bringing me to see Dad
or screwing my brother?

305
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:10,172
Monica, please. It's not a big deal.

306
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:12,716
We agreed to keep it low key
to avoid drama.

307
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:16,804
We agreed not to tell anyone about Dad.
"Low key" isn't your strong suit.

308
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:19,515
I understand you're upset,
but I'm a grown ass man.

309
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:21,558
I don't need you vetting
who I sleep with.

310
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:22,726
It's not like you listen.

311
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:26,230
She'll soon be back with
her driver now that he's single.

312
00:18:26,313 --> 00:18:29,525
-Culhane broke up with Kori?
-Obviously he didn't tell you.

313
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:32,402
Maybe he's learned
to avoid all her drama.

314
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,154
Why haven't we?

315
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:44,832
Homemade  alfajores.

316
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:48,043
I figured the olive branch
could use an upgrade.

317
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:50,838
So, you made those, uh, treats.

318
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:54,800
I thought Mrs. Gunnerson
had some sort of psychotic break.

319
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,309
Healthy sum for a peasant.

320
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:06,311
She's not a peasant.

321
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:09,064
That's probably the last of
the money I sent her.

322
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:13,360
-American cash is king in Venezuela.
-This particular cash has been marked...

323
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:17,656
by me, in case those goons we paid off
come back and cause trouble.

324
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:19,741
How would she have gotten it?
I don't--

325
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:24,413
My own sister tried to rob me.

326
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:25,914
Must be genetic.

327
00:19:31,378 --> 00:19:33,964
Threats, extortion, blackmail.

328
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:36,341
I can't believe Iris would do this.

329
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:40,012
Between the two of you,
is there a commandment you haven't broken?

330
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,932
The literal buck, as they say, stops here.

331
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:46,435
-We are taking this to Blake.
-No.

332
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:50,147
I'm going to my sister first.
I need time to think things through.

333
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:51,440
Time just helps her.

334
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:56,236
If she really scammed us for $300,000,
who's to say she's finished?

335
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,155
I'm not letting her leave,

336
00:19:58,238 --> 00:20:01,283
but please, you have to
let me handle this myself.

337
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:05,412
Oh, I miss the old days
when all you had was a dead ex-lover.

338
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:10,834
I didn't know
your dad had a problem with her.

339
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:14,171
-You left out that information.
-If you were gonna do that,

340
00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:16,548
I would've kept lying
about my girlfriend.

341
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:20,260
Is it hard to believe I'd wanna
do something nice for you and Monica?

342
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,554
Well, and me. But mostly you.

343
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:26,558
After you told me about your father,
I started thinking about prisons.

344
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:31,647
Those things are open 24/7,
365 days a year and they need power.

345
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:35,108
I called to set a meeting
with the Atlanta operations manager

346
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:38,237
who oversees where your dad is.
He wouldn't take my call.

347
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,657
That's why you took Monica with you,
to stage a run-in?

348
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:45,369
I needed a visitor's badge.
I figured I would find the manager

349
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:47,871
while she was with your dad.
Two birds, one stone.

350
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:50,666
Fix your family
and fix our books with a new deal.

351
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:53,335
When Monica bailed,
I had to explain to your dad

352
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:54,920
what happened and I missed the guy.

353
00:20:55,003 --> 00:20:57,756
So, now my dad and my sister
are both pissed at me

354
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:00,259
and we're still in the red.

355
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:01,927
Look, I will fix it, okay?

356
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:02,844

00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:41,842

when I left your house.

368

370
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:48,348
Nothing. Someone planted it.

Even if I wanted to help, I can't.

somebody to cross it for me.

lazy excuse but you didn't even bother.

394

You told me it was getting complicated
to send money every month.

395
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:11,681

all at once by pretending

-It's the only way I knew you cared.

And the other five?

402
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:33,537
You took advantage of our past
and made me think we were at risk

-[Iris] Me? You started it.

498
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:46,868
Well, now I'm ending it.

499
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:49,996
You think you can
control everything, don't you?

500
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:52,832
Especially now that you're just
part of this family

501
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:54,042
and you have all this money,

502
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:56,377
you just think
you can push me out and take my son.

503
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:58,004
I didn't take Sam.

504
00:29:58,087 --> 00:30:01,508
He chose to come here.
After everything you have done to me,

505
00:30:01,591 --> 00:30:04,177
I can't imagine what kind of mother
you were to him after I left.

506
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:07,055
-I was a good mother.
-Bad mothers always say that.

507
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:10,058
Ow!

508
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:12,060
[grunting]

509
00:30:15,772 --> 00:30:17,398
Happy birthday, Jesus!

510
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:20,652
I never did anything
but try to make your life better.

511
00:30:20,735 --> 00:30:23,446
Is that what you told yourself
when you abandoned us?

512
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:26,950
-When you got in that truck in Caracas?
-I had no choice. I needed a doctor.

513
00:30:27,033 --> 00:30:29,160
It's not my fault you never showed up.

514
00:30:29,285 --> 00:30:30,411
Why didn't you?

515
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:36,709
Because you wanted me to leave.

516
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:39,796
You blamed me
for what happened that night.

517
00:30:39,879 --> 00:30:43,299
-That's why you think I owe you.
-What are you talking about?

518
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:45,927
Go ahead, Cristal.
Why don't you tell him?

519
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:50,014
-Why don't you tell everyone?
-I can't take it anymore, Iris.

520
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:52,100
[speaking in Spanish]

521
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:01,693
Iris, no.

522
00:31:01,776 --> 00:31:03,319
[speaking in Spanish]

523
00:31:05,321 --> 00:31:07,824
[yelling in Spanish]

524
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:24,924
[Iris screaming]

525
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:31,097
[speaking in Spanish]

526
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:34,434
Samuel, I killed your father.

527
00:32:00,793 --> 00:32:02,253
You're looking for my mom?

528
00:32:02,837 --> 00:32:04,631
She left without saying goodbye.

529
00:32:05,214 --> 00:32:06,591
I'm looking for you, Sam.

530
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:10,970
I am so sorry about your dad,
about it all.

531
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:14,140
I never wanted you
to find out in this way.

532
00:32:14,223 --> 00:32:16,392
And how were you hoping I'd find out?

533
00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:19,312
There is not a day that goes by
that I don't wish that I could change

534
00:32:19,395 --> 00:32:23,566
what happened or how I handled it,
but your dad was a violent man.

535
00:32:23,858 --> 00:32:26,235
I was protecting your mom and you.

536
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:29,197
But all these years
you let me think he abandoned me.

537
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:32,575
I grew up feeling completely worthless,
thinking why should anyone care

538
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:35,703
-about me if my dad didn't?
-I care about you, Sam.

539
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:39,165
And you're not worthless.
You have to know that.

540
00:32:39,248 --> 00:32:41,626
Well, I'm glad
you saved my mom that night.

541
00:32:42,335 --> 00:32:47,215
But you robbed me of the truth about
my life every single day after that.

542
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:56,057
Saying sorry
won't make up for tonight.

543
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:58,559
Tonight?
What about the last five months?

544
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:01,854
I know you don't trust me now
but please, let me explain.

545
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:04,273
Like you did
about your relationship with Matthew?

546
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:07,235
Or that your real name is Celia,
or that you stole hundreds

547
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:08,653
of thousands of dollars?

548
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:12,407
I know that I have said this before,
but this is it.

549
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:14,534
This is everything. I promise.

550
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:19,372
I'm willing to do whatever it takes
to show you that this is the whole me,

551
00:33:19,455 --> 00:33:22,333
that I love you with my whole heart.

552
00:33:22,875 --> 00:33:24,419
And that is the whole truth.

553
00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:27,296
Can you believe me?

554
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:30,091
Yes, I believe you.

555
00:33:30,633 --> 00:33:33,511
I believe you were willing
to do whatever it takes...

556
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:35,680
to put your past behind you.

557
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:39,892
-I just don't know that I am.
-What does that mean?

558
00:33:52,321 --> 00:33:53,489
You're up early.

559
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:57,660
[sighs] It's hard to rest for Santa
when you have a murderous stepmom

560
00:33:57,744 --> 00:33:58,995
sleeping down the hall.

561
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,288
What's your excuse?

562
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:01,789
I got you something.

563
00:34:03,082 --> 00:34:04,042
[Fallon chuckles]

564
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:05,334
Enjoy memory lane.

565
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:08,379
What are you two reminiscing about?

566
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:11,674
Back in the old days,
we used to hire the help

567
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:13,801
to make the beds, not sleep in them.

568
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:15,636
-That's enough.
-I know you think I'm just

569
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:18,389
-an old, white, close-minded tight ass.
-Go on.

570
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:22,518
But I was young once,
and a lot like you in some ways.

571
00:34:23,102 --> 00:34:24,771
I had my own lost weekend.

572
00:34:25,271 --> 00:34:27,482
Quite a few of them, if I'm being honest.

573
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:31,402
And your great grandfather
snapped me out of it...

574
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:34,030
-just like I did to you.
-What?

575
00:34:34,113 --> 00:34:35,948
But that's what this family is, right?

576
00:34:36,532 --> 00:34:40,620
We love life, we get drunk,
and we do cocaine with Stevie Nicks.

577
00:34:40,703 --> 00:34:43,122
But we're not kids anymore, Steven.

578
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:45,958
Your father didn't get rid of your friend

579
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:49,003
just so you could go down
that destructive path again.

580
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:55,927
You couldn't have
kept that to yourself?

581
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:58,179
That was a rotten thing to say.

582
00:34:58,262 --> 00:35:01,849
Sometimes rotten things
have to be said and done...

583
00:35:02,892 --> 00:35:04,060
Carrington style.

584
00:35:04,894 --> 00:35:07,730
Now, I let your father keep his job,
but if you think

585
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:09,524
I'm gonna let him disobey me...

586
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:11,442
without any consequences...

587
00:35:12,568 --> 00:35:14,946
you're not the smart businesswoman
I always thought you were.

588
00:35:15,029 --> 00:35:16,948
It's called evolving, Grandpa.

589
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:18,407
You should try it.

590
00:35:18,741 --> 00:35:19,700
Sooner the better.

591
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:31,754
There's another Christmas
without a goodbye.

592
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:36,050
Everyone deals
with their families in their own way.

593
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:38,845
Some choose to leave them
during the holidays,

594
00:35:38,928 --> 00:35:40,805
others after a murder.

595
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:46,060
You chose to bring Iris here
so you'd find out more about Cristal.

596
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:48,396
I hate to say
you got what you wished for...

597
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:50,690
-Least I get my chess partner back.
-Hm.

598
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:52,984
I bet you missed winning.

599
00:35:53,067 --> 00:35:55,987
I let your father win
so he feels good about himself.

600
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:58,489
You, on the other hand,
like the challenge.

601
00:36:00,616 --> 00:36:02,118
You did have Ted arrested.

602
00:36:02,785 --> 00:36:04,453
Grandpa just told me.

603
00:36:04,912 --> 00:36:05,997
Good luck with that.

604
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:10,001
-Fool me once, right?
-No, I fooled your grandfather.

605
00:36:10,459 --> 00:36:15,089
I had nothing to do with Ted's arrest.
Not to say that I minded it.

606
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:16,799
Why do you keep defending him?

607
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:19,802
He's nothing but quicksand.
All he's ever done is drag you down.

608
00:36:19,886 --> 00:36:21,220
Ted didn't drag me down.

609
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:23,014
I dragged him.

610
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:27,351
You know, you need to stop blaming
other people for what I do.

611
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:29,687
-Trying to protect you.
-You've been trying my whole life.

612
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:31,230
You really think that helps me?

613
00:36:31,647 --> 00:36:34,025
Blaming other people for my mistakes?

614
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:37,069
Ted's in jail. It's where I should be.

615
00:36:37,153 --> 00:36:39,697
You didn't have drugs in your car.
Stop being a martyr.

616
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:41,824
I'm talking about Dominic Ortega.

617
00:36:42,742 --> 00:36:44,911
Stansfield told me before he left town.

618
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:49,498
I messed up on that rig, Ortega died
and you made Matthew cover it up.

619
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:51,876
It would've ruined you, son.

620
00:36:51,959 --> 00:36:54,462
Well... now it's ruined us.

621
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:01,344
Hey.

622
00:37:04,347 --> 00:37:06,933
-Thank you for coming.
-If you wanted to apologize again,

623
00:37:07,016 --> 00:37:10,269
-you could've done that on the phone.
-I couldn't have given you this.

624
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:13,231
The Colby Kids fund?

625
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:15,900
A non-profit endowment
that provides transportation vouchers

626
00:37:15,983 --> 00:37:17,944
for children to visit
their incarcerated parents.

627
00:37:18,027 --> 00:37:20,238
This is just another tax break
to get your books right.

628
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:21,322
No.

629
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:24,325
I decided Morell Corp.
will end its year in the red.

630
00:37:24,825 --> 00:37:27,286
Some things
are more important than finances.

631
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:29,622
Few things. But...

632
00:37:30,164 --> 00:37:33,417
you were always there for me...
especially when my mom left.

633
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:35,920
I wish you could've let me
be there for you.

634
00:37:36,003 --> 00:37:38,297
Your mom traipsing off to England
is not the same thing

635
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:40,132
as my dad getting arrested for drugs.

636
00:37:40,716 --> 00:37:44,220
I was so embarrassed
by the cliché he turned me into.

637
00:37:44,804 --> 00:37:46,973
A scholarship kid with a dad in prison.

638
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,141
I never went to visit him.

639
00:37:49,725 --> 00:37:52,019
He was so hurt
that he never forgave me.

640
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:53,896
I mean, I was just a kid...

641
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:56,774
but he said,
"We all reap what we sow."

642
00:37:58,401 --> 00:37:59,360
But I mean, hey...

643
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:02,655
at least my friends
didn't see me as less than.

644
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:07,451
-Or as their own personal charity case.
-Monica, I've never seen you that way.

645
00:38:09,578 --> 00:38:12,790
Fallon, I'm not here
to make you feel good about yourself.

646
00:38:12,873 --> 00:38:13,916
Jeff can do that.

647
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:16,919
And if you cared about our friendship,

648
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:19,380
you stop using him to replace Culhane.

649
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:20,298
But I'm not.

650
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:23,968
Jeff did literally tell me
I could use him.

651
00:38:24,051 --> 00:38:25,553
Then that's on you, Fallon.

652
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:28,180
But we all reap what we sow.

653
00:38:31,892 --> 00:38:32,727
[Jeff] Hey, Bobby.

654
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:34,854
Oh, sorry. Chief of police.

655
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:37,648
I'll never get used to calling you that.

656
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:40,026
Can't believe how far
my cousin's come up.

657
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:44,530
I wanted to thank you for helping me
with that Ted Dinard thing.

658
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:45,948
I owe you.

659
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:48,159
[door buzzes, then opens]

660
00:38:48,242 --> 00:38:49,368
He's ready for you.

661
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:54,081
-What the hell was that about?
-I didn't know she would--

662
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:55,541
[in Yoruba] Are you crazy, son?

663
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:58,836
-Fallon Carrington?
-I shouldn't have told her.

664
00:38:58,919 --> 00:39:00,921
I had no idea she would come visit.

665
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:03,507
And here I was thinking
you were the smart one.

666
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:04,800
[in Yoruba] You're a fool.

667
00:39:04,884 --> 00:39:07,345
It's not what it looks like, Dad.

668
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:08,262
No, it's not.

669
00:39:08,637 --> 00:39:10,222
You're in one hell of a mess.

670
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:12,516
And it's my fault.

671
00:39:15,144 --> 00:39:17,480
What?
You think I'm here on drug charges?

672
00:39:17,563 --> 00:39:20,066
You think
I'm that much of a stereotype?

673
00:39:20,649 --> 00:39:22,109
Yeah, sure looks like one.

674
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:25,738
But try being a black man in Georgia
with no legal representation.

675
00:39:25,821 --> 00:39:28,491
Forced to appear in front of a judge
and explain how a brick of blow

676
00:39:28,574 --> 00:39:29,784
got into the trunk of my car.

677
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:31,994
A judge who's
country club membership

678
00:39:32,078 --> 00:39:34,205
is paid for by the Carringtons.

679
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:38,125
Mm. Yeah, they wanted me gone... quietly.

680
00:39:39,168 --> 00:39:42,171
So it wouldn't come out
that I was trying to kill the man

681
00:39:42,254 --> 00:39:44,173
that was screwing your mother.

682
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:46,300
Blake Carrington.

683
00:39:49,303 --> 00:39:50,888
Think I don't know that?

684
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:56,644
Wish it hadn't taken so long for you
to tell me yourself, but I figured it out.

685
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:01,232
Why do you think
I'm getting so close to his family?

686
00:40:02,108 --> 00:40:03,025
Hm?

687
00:40:04,193 --> 00:40:06,737

Some teacher/DJ did
at the Penley Winter Dance.
