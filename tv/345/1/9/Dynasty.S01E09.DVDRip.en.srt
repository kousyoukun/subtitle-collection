1
00:02:03,113 --> 00:02:06,571
Jeanette, I wanna talk to Peter Burroughs.
Get him on the telephone for me, will you?

2
00:02:06,684 --> 00:02:10,415
This hour?
Get him for me. I'll be in the library.

3
00:02:14,258 --> 00:02:15,292
<i>[ Blake ]
No.! No.! No, Peter.!</i>

4
00:02:15,327 --> 00:02:17,988
<i>[ Blake ]
No.! No.! No, Peter.!</i>

5
00:02:18,095 --> 00:02:20,996
<i>Blaisdel. Matthew Blaisdel.</i>

6
00:02:21,098 --> 00:02:24,124
Well, I've just come
from a party at the Patricks'...

7
00:02:24,235 --> 00:02:29,138
and I heard that somebody gave him the money
to fish the bit out of that rig of his.

8
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:32,698
Well, it means that he's started up
his operation, that's what it means.

9
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:36,211
I wanna know who it was
that gave him that money.

10
00:02:36,313 --> 00:02:39,510
Yes. Yes, indeed,
I have my suspicions.

11
00:02:39,617 --> 00:02:43,610
<i>Yes. Yes, I suspect
it could be Patrick.</i>

12
00:02:43,721 --> 00:02:48,385
Or it could be Harrison or MacReady
or Wilson or Manning or Colby.

13
00:02:48,492 --> 00:02:50,790
<i>You name it.</i>

14
00:02:50,895 --> 00:02:55,025
<i>Correction, Peter. You find out.</i>

15
00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:04,367
They're your friends, Blake.

16
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:08,002
<i>Hmm?
Colby, Harrison and the others.</i>

17
00:03:08,112 --> 00:03:11,172
They're old friends.
It wasn't one of them.

18
00:03:11,282 --> 00:03:13,978
How do you know that?

19
00:03:15,286 --> 00:03:18,983
Because I know them. I feel it.

20
00:03:20,991 --> 00:03:25,428
Well, let me tell you something
about friends, Krystle my friends.

21
00:03:25,529 --> 00:03:29,932
[ Sighs ] In this business,
your only friend is a dead enemy.

22
00:03:30,034 --> 00:03:34,698
The minute you hit the ground, these friends
will turn on you like a pack of hungry dogs.

23
00:03:34,805 --> 00:03:40,300
Why do you say that?
Well, because if the situation was reversed...

24
00:03:40,411 --> 00:03:43,175
I would do the same to them.

25
00:03:52,423 --> 00:03:55,085
You're trembling.

26
00:03:56,860 --> 00:04:00,057
It's just
that it's cold in here, and...

27
00:04:00,164 --> 00:04:03,429
I don't enjoy seeing you upset.

28
00:04:05,169 --> 00:04:07,262
You know something?

29
00:04:07,371 --> 00:04:12,434
You are the only person in this whole,
burntout world that I feel comfortable with.

30
00:04:14,178 --> 00:04:17,079
I mean... really comfortable.

31
00:04:25,189 --> 00:04:28,124
That's awfully nice to hear.

32
00:04:28,225 --> 00:04:32,218
Sometimes the pressures are so heavy that
I know.

33
00:04:35,366 --> 00:04:39,393
Now, Fallon.
She's never been easy...

34
00:04:39,503 --> 00:04:44,133
but I think she's beginning to come around
now that she's married toJeff.

35
00:04:44,241 --> 00:04:47,233
Notice any change in her?

36
00:04:47,344 --> 00:04:49,335
Yes.

37
00:04:49,446 --> 00:04:53,974
Now, Steven
He'll come around too, Blake. You'll see.

38
00:04:55,252 --> 00:04:57,846
[ Chuckles ]
""Blake.''

39
00:04:57,955 --> 00:05:00,947
You know,
when Steven was born...

40
00:05:01,058 --> 00:05:04,186
his mother wanted
to name him ""Blake,'' and I said

41
00:05:04,294 --> 00:05:07,593
Well, I said no.

42
00:05:07,698 --> 00:05:10,997
I had no reason why. I just said,
""Let's name him after your father.''

43
00:05:14,304 --> 00:05:16,272
You think the boy
might have sensed that?

44
00:05:16,373 --> 00:05:20,469
Do you think that could've
affected him in some way?

45
00:05:20,577 --> 00:05:22,909
I don't think so.

46
00:05:25,616 --> 00:05:29,074
Krystle, our child,
when we have one

47
00:05:29,186 --> 00:05:32,121
and I know we're gonna
have one soon

48
00:05:32,222 --> 00:05:36,784
we'll call him Blake, all right?

49
00:05:36,894 --> 00:05:40,625
Our child,
the one that you will give me.

50
00:06:04,254 --> 00:06:07,951
Hi, honey.
Be ready in a minute.

51
00:06:24,475 --> 00:06:28,206
I'm looking for a job.
Why?

52
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:32,039
Well...

53
00:06:34,218 --> 00:06:37,415
I want a job.

54
00:06:37,521 --> 00:06:40,388
It's piping hot, so blow on it.

55
00:06:40,491 --> 00:06:44,393
Claudia, things financially,
they're not that rough.

56
00:06:44,495 --> 00:06:48,158
In fact, they're getting pretty good again.
I know that.

57
00:06:48,265 --> 00:06:50,324
I'm glad.

58
00:06:50,434 --> 00:06:54,871
I wanna go to work.
Maybe that's a better way of putting it.

59
00:07:00,811 --> 00:07:03,302
What about Lindsay?

60
00:07:03,413 --> 00:07:06,280
Don't you think she needs you more
than you need a job?

61
00:07:06,383 --> 00:07:11,218
Well, of course she does.
She's at school most of the day.

62
00:07:11,321 --> 00:07:16,520
Anyway, I don't plan on working nights.
I'll be home every day from 4:00 to 5:00.

63
00:07:18,662 --> 00:07:21,426
Claudia, I can support my family.

64
00:07:21,532 --> 00:07:24,126
I don't need for anyone
to think otherwise.

65
00:07:24,234 --> 00:07:27,397
Matthew, nobody's gonna think that.

66
00:07:27,504 --> 00:07:31,406
Good. It's settled.
No more talk of work and jobs and all that.

67
00:07:31,508 --> 00:07:36,571
Matthew, it is not settled.
It's not settled at all.

68
00:07:42,786 --> 00:07:46,813
Don't worry. Nobody's going to say that
Matthew Blaisdel needs hormone shots...

69
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:50,189
just 'cause his wife's
got a parttime job.

70
00:07:50,294 --> 00:07:52,694
<i>I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.</i>

71
00:07:52,796 --> 00:07:56,197
Look. I never went
to college, you know?

72
00:07:56,300 --> 00:08:00,259
<i>I'm not blaming you for that.
I made you a mother at 1 6.</i>

73
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:02,861
You didn't do it
by yourself, you know.

74
00:08:02,973 --> 00:08:05,703
I know, but

75
00:08:07,277 --> 00:08:10,940
Well, it seems that...

76
00:08:11,048 --> 00:08:14,142
you had so much goin' for ya I mean...

77
00:08:14,251 --> 00:08:16,742
<i>ahead of you and all.</i>

78
00:08:16,854 --> 00:08:22,121
<i>You never got to go to college.
You didn't even finish
[ Claudia ] It doesn't matter.</i>

79
00:08:22,226 --> 00:08:26,754
<i>We were kids.
We got into trouble.</i>

80
00:08:26,864 --> 00:08:29,799
<i>We made a mistake.</i>

81
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:35,236
We have to figure a way to stop punishing
each other, to forgive each other for that, huh?

82
00:08:35,339 --> 00:08:37,307
I know.

83
00:08:41,511 --> 00:08:43,843
H Breakfast is ready.

84
00:08:43,947 --> 00:08:47,246
No. I'm not very hungry.
And I'm late.

85
00:08:47,351 --> 00:08:53,017
No. It's early.
I'm really late, and I have to go.

86
00:09:46,176 --> 00:09:48,701
Hey, Matthew!

87
00:09:48,812 --> 00:09:51,246
Tom, you got a problem?
Yeah.

88
00:09:51,348 --> 00:09:55,045
I thought the rig was runnin' pretty smooth,
but something funny started happening.

89
00:09:55,152 --> 00:09:57,848
I think maybe you'd
better take a look at that B.O.P.

90
00:09:57,955 --> 00:10:00,287
Why don't you get Walter to do it?
I gotta make a phone call.

91
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:04,121
Wait a minute. Walter's sacked out.
He's been working all night.

92
00:10:04,227 --> 00:10:06,718
You really don't want me
to wake him up, do you?

93
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:09,230
Not if you value your life.

94
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:12,860
All right. Let's take a look.
Listen, I told my brotherinlaw
to stop by and see you.

95
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:15,871
He's a good roughneck.

96
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:55,101
You know what I'm thinkin'? Somebody pulled
this screw out. That's why we twisted off.

97
00:10:55,212 --> 00:10:58,579
<i>And I think
I know who did it.</i>

98
00:11:18,602 --> 00:11:20,866
So the bartender comes in.
He's looking at an orangutan.

99
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:22,996
He says,
""Look, man, you're costin' me money.''

100
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:33,113
The orangutan looks up and says,
""If you're charging them 1 0 bucks a bourbon...

101
00:11:33,216 --> 00:11:36,481
like you're charging me, man, you're
gonna lose them and me at the same time.''

102
00:11:44,661 --> 00:11:46,686
[ Man ]
Ooh!

103
00:11:46,797 --> 00:11:49,960
Hey, you run 'em again,
I'm gonna start cryin' a lot.

104
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:54,899
Hey. How you doin',
Matthew?

105
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:57,166
Fine.Just fine.

106
00:11:57,274 --> 00:11:59,902
Thought I'd catch up
with you at the rig.

107
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:03,741
Well, I'm just takin' a break.
Man's entitled.

108
00:12:03,847 --> 00:12:06,111
Sure is.

109
00:12:06,216 --> 00:12:10,846
<i>Besides, I'm celebratin; You got all the money
again to start up with the work.</i>

110
00:12:10,954 --> 00:12:14,617
How'd you get it, anyway?
I made it a practice never to discuss my business...

111
00:12:14,724 --> 00:12:17,249
with other people.

112
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,295
Good idea.
So what's on your mind?

113
00:12:20,397 --> 00:12:25,926
Oh, beer,
a little conversation.

114
00:12:26,036 --> 00:12:29,904
Well, sounds good to me,
'cept my friend here, the hustler...

115
00:12:30,006 --> 00:12:33,339
has just left me something
to play with.

116
00:12:38,682 --> 00:12:41,583
Steven Carrington
didn't twist us off.

117
00:12:41,685 --> 00:12:44,449
He was set up.

118
00:12:47,657 --> 00:12:51,218
You sayin'
that I did that, Matthew?

119
00:12:51,328 --> 00:12:54,456
Take it anyway you want.

120
00:12:54,564 --> 00:12:58,227
Well, why don't you go back
and ask young Miss Carrington about it, huh?

121
00:12:58,335 --> 00:13:00,826
I'm askin' you.

122
00:13:00,937 --> 00:13:04,464
Well, a kinda question like that could end up
with you chewin' on a cue stick...

123
00:13:04,574 --> 00:13:07,771
<i>[ Men Laughing ]
if you get my meaning.</i>

124
00:13:07,878 --> 00:13:10,676
Why don't you go back
and ask your sissy friend?

125
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:16,911
I'd rather have a sissy for a friend
than a sneak and a coward.

126
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:31,124
Are you sayin' that
about me, Matt?

127
00:13:31,234 --> 00:13:34,863
I don't see anyone else in this room
that fits that description.

128
00:13:40,777 --> 00:13:43,974
<i>[ Man ] Hey.! Come on.! Hey, fellas.!

00:14:44,374 --> 00:14:46,274
[ Gasping ]
Who paid ya?

135
00:14:46,376 --> 00:14:48,310
You're crazy!
Who paid ya to twist us off?

136
00:14:48,411 --> 00:14:51,505
Let me go!
You're crazy!

137
00:14:51,615 --> 00:14:53,515
[ Gasping ]
Who?

138
00:14:53,617 --> 00:14:56,552
I did it on my own.

139
00:15:04,894 --> 00:15:07,260
[ Gasping ]
Who? Damn you! Who?

140
00:15:07,364 --> 00:15:10,128
Carrington's people.
[ Gasping ]

141
00:15:10,233 --> 00:15:13,691
I'm gonna give you some advice. I don't
wanna see your miserable face again.

142
00:15:13,803 --> 00:15:16,636
You got that?

143
00:16:00,016 --> 00:16:03,474
Well, Matthew, you look
like you've been in some kind of a scrape.

144
00:16:03,586 --> 00:16:05,986
You've probably heard
about it by now.

145
00:16:06,089 --> 00:16:10,685
And who was the unlucky man at the other end
of those sometimes notorious fists?

146
00:16:10,794 --> 00:16:15,197
Names don't mean anything.
None of my business, huh?

147
00:16:15,298 --> 00:16:19,200
Well, can I pour you a drink?
No.

00:16:28,912 --> 00:16:32,143
Well, all right then, Matthew,
what are you here for?

152
00:16:35,218 --> 00:16:40,554
I wanna know what kind of man would let his son
take the rap for something he didn't do...

153
00:16:40,657 --> 00:16:43,057
<i>for something
his own father set up.</i>

154
00:16:43,159 --> 00:16:45,627
Oh. That, huh?

155
00:16:45,729 --> 00:16:49,165
So I'm suspected of that, am I?

156
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,332
The trouble with you,
Matthew, is two things:

157
00:16:53,436 --> 00:16:58,499
One, you're as quick with your accusations
as you are sometimes with your fists.

158
00:16:58,608 --> 00:17:03,204
<i>And two,you're really
very emotional, aren't you?</i>

159
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:09,115
I mean, under that cool layer of hide,
there sits an emotional streak...

160
00:17:09,219 --> 00:17:11,744
that says something to me

161
00:17:11,855 --> 00:17:16,656
that you're not cut out
for that new managerial position of yours.

162
00:17:22,932 --> 00:17:26,959
<i>You know, Blake,
I used to respect you.</i>

163
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:30,506
I used to think you were the smartest man
I'd ever known, but you're losin' it.

164
00:17:30,607 --> 00:17:33,906
<i>You're dyin'in it.
You're operating the old way.</i>

165
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:38,879
Trouble is, the day of the old tycoon
the oil baron is over.

166
00:17:38,982 --> 00:17:43,749
And like them,
you don't have any values anymore.

167
00:17:43,853 --> 00:17:46,754
You don't give a damn
about anybody or anything.

168
00:17:46,856 --> 00:17:51,486
Oh, come on, Matthew. You're talking
about America, the American dream.

169
00:17:51,594 --> 00:17:54,791
Laissezfaire. Mother.
Apple pie. Petroleum.

170
00:17:54,898 --> 00:17:59,631
I'm talkin' about how you poison just
about every damn thing you touch.

171
00:17:59,736 --> 00:18:03,069
Just about everything, huh?
Including my wife?

172
00:18:06,976 --> 00:18:10,207
Does that include the only thing
that you really want?

173
00:18:11,915 --> 00:18:16,045
I know you, Matthew. We've been friends,
and we've been enemies too.

174
00:18:16,152 --> 00:18:18,916
I know one thing about you,
that you're honest.

175
00:18:19,022 --> 00:18:22,389
So you look me right in the eye
and you tell me...

176
00:18:22,492 --> 00:18:26,724
that you still don't think about Krystle
every night and every day.

177
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:30,129
<i>Day and night.</i>

178
00:18:30,233 --> 00:18:33,566
You do that,
and I'll call off my dogs.

179
00:18:55,725 --> 00:18:59,058
Oh, Mrs. Gunnerson, is that for me?
No. It's for Steven.

180
00:18:59,162 --> 00:19:03,223
Do you know if he's still in his room?
Uh, I think so.

181
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:06,166
Oh, Mrs. Gunnerson, I forgot something.
I'm going back upstairs.

182
00:19:06,269 --> 00:19:08,965
Why don't you just give that to me?
I'll give it to him.

183
00:19:09,072 --> 00:19:12,200
Mrs. Gunnerson?
Of course.

184
00:19:33,863 --> 00:19:37,560
Get thee behind me, Satan!
[ Screams, Gasps ]

185
00:19:37,667 --> 00:19:39,862
Uh, it's for you, Steven.

186
00:19:39,969 --> 00:19:45,737
Well, how about that?
Well, it could've been for me.
The ""Steven'' isn't very clear.

187
00:19:45,842 --> 00:19:48,538
Besides, I thought it might be an emergency
from Jeff in the Middle East...

188
00:19:48,645 --> 00:19:51,045
dodging all the cross fire and stuff.

189
00:19:51,147 --> 00:19:55,481
You don't like him being there.
Well, I think it was pretty dumb
of his uncle to send him now.

190
00:19:55,585 --> 00:19:59,681
Well, Cecil Colby obviously knows
that he's gonna do a pretty good job.

191
00:19:59,789 --> 00:20:02,724
Otherwise, he would've
sent somebody else.

192
00:20:02,825 --> 00:20:05,487
Aren't you gonna open it?
Yes, I am.

193
00:20:05,595 --> 00:20:11,158
Well, who do you think it's from, Stevie?
Oh, I know who it's from.

194
00:20:29,085 --> 00:20:33,886
Are you at least talking to me? Look,
Mrs. Nemerover's holding the part open for you.

195
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:38,290
I don't wanna do it.
Well, you don't have to kiss him.

196
00:20:38,394 --> 00:20:42,854
What are your parents going to say?
I don't know. I don't care.

197
00:20:42,966 --> 00:20:45,457
Look, your mom told my mom that
she's nearly finished making your costume

198
00:20:45,568 --> 00:20:50,062
Would you lay off
about my parents, Tania, please?

199
00:20:54,577 --> 00:20:57,671
I'm sorry. Lindsay, what's with you?

200
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:01,876
Are you in trouble? I mean, when you cut class
You wanna know where I went?

201
00:21:01,985 --> 00:21:04,954
I'll tell you,
and I don't care who you tell.

202
00:21:08,625 --> 00:21:11,617
I went to
the county clerk's office...

203
00:21:11,728 --> 00:21:15,789
to check on my parents'
marriage certificate.

204
00:21:15,898 --> 00:21:21,131
[ Sobbing ] I found out they had to
get married because of me.

205
00:21:21,237 --> 00:21:24,001
Oh. Well, hey, that's okay.

206
00:21:24,107 --> 00:21:28,100
<i>I mean, come on. You're not the first one
that's happened to.</i>

207
00:21:28,211 --> 00:21:33,376
And it's not your fault. Well, I mean,
it's not your parents' fault either.

208
00:21:33,483 --> 00:21:36,611
<i>Maybe they couldn't
help themselves.</i>

209
00:21:36,719 --> 00:21:40,177
Oh, Lindsay,
it's not the end of the world.

210
00:22:03,246 --> 00:22:05,578
Hi, darling.
Hi.

211
00:22:05,682 --> 00:22:10,585
You have an accident?
Nothing big.

212
00:22:10,687 --> 00:22:13,451
You look tired.

213
00:22:20,663 --> 00:22:23,757
Well, I guess I am.

214
00:22:26,436 --> 00:22:30,133
I don't know. I just felt
like I wanted to come home...

215
00:22:30,239 --> 00:22:33,174
and spend a little time
with my family.

216
00:22:33,276 --> 00:22:36,109
Walter's handling things,
and Bobby's come back.

217
00:22:36,212 --> 00:22:39,409
Is that the dress Lindsay's
wearin' for the play?

218
00:22:39,515 --> 00:22:42,450
That's pretty. Where is she?

219
00:22:43,653 --> 00:22:46,178
She's upstairs... in bed.

220
00:22:46,289 --> 00:22:48,849
This early?

221
00:22:48,958 --> 00:22:53,793
She said she wasn't feeling well.
I think there's something going around.

222
00:22:59,602 --> 00:23:05,063
I'll fix you some pork chops,
okay? They're really good.
No, honey. I ate with the crew.

223
00:23:05,174 --> 00:23:07,199
Are you sure?
I'm sure.

224
00:23:11,481 --> 00:23:13,745
I'm gonna go
look in on Lindsay.

225
00:24:41,304 --> 00:24:44,364
Here you are.
I didn't ask for that.

226
00:24:44,473 --> 00:24:47,101
Well, I know,
but I thought you might want some.

227
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:52,147
Krystle, I'm busy. You see, I'm tryin'
to make some sense out of this mess.

228
00:24:52,248 --> 00:24:55,445
Can't it wait till morning?

229
00:24:58,054 --> 00:25:00,522
Are you coming to bed?
Yeah. In a while. Soon.

230
00:25:00,623 --> 00:25:02,716
Soon.

231
00:25:42,932 --> 00:25:45,901
Hi!
Hello, Fallon.

232
00:25:47,637 --> 00:25:52,336
<i>Did you have a good time?
Yes, I did.</i>

233
00:25:52,441 --> 00:25:55,706
Sorry to disappoint you.
Why would that disappoint me?

234
00:25:55,811 --> 00:25:59,679
Well, because
my husband's out of town...

235
00:25:59,782 --> 00:26:02,546
and according to
your bourgeois ethical system...

236
00:26:02,652 --> 00:26:05,587
I should've been locked
in my room with a Bronte novel.

237
00:26:05,688 --> 00:26:11,183
<i>In case you're interested,
my escort tonight was Muffins Begley...</i>

238
00:26:11,294 --> 00:26:16,197
you know, of Begley Bed
I mean, Begley Bread.

239
00:26:16,299 --> 00:26:20,895
Begley Bread and muffins,
and pastries, whatever.

240
00:26:22,438 --> 00:26:25,896
<i>Is Dad home?</i>

241
00:26:26,008 --> 00:26:29,739
Is Steven home?

242
00:26:29,845 --> 00:26:32,473
Oh. Good night.

243
00:27:30,606 --> 00:27:33,575
Backgammon, anyone? Monopoly?

244
00:27:33,676 --> 00:27:36,543
Steal the Old Man's Bundle?

245
00:27:36,645 --> 00:27:39,341
Anything to cheer up
a deserted old wife.

246
00:27:39,448 --> 00:27:42,747
How 'bout lettin'
a little old brother get some sleep?

247
00:27:42,852 --> 00:27:46,413
Why? What did you do today
that you're so tired?

248
00:27:46,522 --> 00:27:49,719
I spent the whole day thinking.
Oh!

249
00:27:49,825 --> 00:27:52,885
God knows that can be worse than work.

250
00:27:52,995 --> 00:27:57,489
Thinking about what?
About what I'm going to do.

251
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:03,129
Well, there's Dad's offer.
Don't sell him short, Stevie.

252
00:28:03,239 --> 00:28:08,734
Okay. I've waited all day to ask,
and that's a record.

253
00:28:08,844 --> 00:28:11,608
Who'd you get the telegram from?

254
00:28:11,714 --> 00:28:13,909
You know that, Fallon.

255
00:28:14,016 --> 00:28:17,076
Your Ted?
Ted.

256
00:28:18,187 --> 00:28:21,054
And Ted said? Or said Ted?

257
00:28:21,157 --> 00:28:24,149
That he was going
to be in Los Angeles tomorrow...

258
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:27,855
and that he was going to be
in San Francisco the day after...

259
00:28:27,963 --> 00:28:31,399
and he wanted me to meet him
at either place, okay?

260
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:34,765
Well, the question is,
is it okay with you?

261
00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:38,237
I mean, do you wanna meet him
or be with him in either place?

262
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:40,501
I'm not sure.

263
00:28:44,814 --> 00:28:48,147
Steven, remember when you were little?
You had every little girl in this place...

264
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:51,378
doing flipflops all over you.

265
00:28:51,487 --> 00:28:55,048
How did you feel then
about those girls?

266
00:28:55,157 --> 00:28:59,958
I was attracted. And that
they were very pretty, a lot of them.

267
00:29:00,062 --> 00:29:05,090
Well, some of them still are.
And they're still doing flipflops too.

268
00:29:05,201 --> 00:29:08,728
Have you ever tried
with one of them?

269
00:29:08,838 --> 00:29:11,773
<i>Have you ever tried
with any girl?</i>

270
00:29:13,709 --> 00:29:16,735
You haven't, have you?

271
00:29:16,846 --> 00:29:20,043
Steven, if you haven't
even tried...

272
00:29:20,149 --> 00:29:23,312
how are you gonna know
who you really are or what you are?

273
00:29:25,054 --> 00:29:28,490
Maybe I'll never know, Fallon.

274
00:29:28,591 --> 00:29:31,958
I don't know why
we are what we are.

275
00:29:32,061 --> 00:29:35,861
We haven't had a mother around
for a very long time. That could be it.

276
00:29:35,965 --> 00:29:37,933
Ohh.

277
00:29:39,802 --> 00:29:44,296
Here I am, the scandal of Colorado,
and here you are

278
00:29:44,406 --> 00:29:50,140
Blake Carrington's mistake.
Boy, we are a pair. Phew.

279
00:29:50,246 --> 00:29:54,512
Well, whatever we are,
I know one thing:

280
00:29:54,617 --> 00:29:57,177
You're scared.

281
00:29:57,286 --> 00:30:01,586
And so am I.
Lots of stuff still scares me...

282
00:30:03,492 --> 00:30:06,825
like I won't amount to anything...

283
00:30:09,732 --> 00:30:12,724
that I won't measure up
to Blake Carrington.

284
00:30:14,370 --> 00:30:19,205
Remember how after our mother left,
I couldn't sleep for six months?

285
00:30:19,308 --> 00:30:22,607
I used to come in here,
and we'd hold hands in the dark...

286
00:30:24,313 --> 00:30:28,409
wondering where she went
and why she went...

287
00:30:28,517 --> 00:30:31,145
<i>and never knowing.</i>

288
00:30:33,155 --> 00:30:36,591
Remember how I used to tell you
how much I loved you and cared about you?

289
00:30:36,692 --> 00:30:39,354
No. I don't
remember any of that.

290
00:30:42,431 --> 00:30:45,298
Well, I'm telling you again now.

291
00:31:25,007 --> 00:31:29,341
I got word you wanted to see me.
Yeah.

292
00:31:31,847 --> 00:31:34,680
I still owe you
a half week's wages.

293
00:31:40,889 --> 00:31:45,121
Is that all?
No.

294
00:31:45,227 --> 00:31:48,196
When I apologize to a man,
I like to do it facetoface.

295
00:31:48,297 --> 00:31:51,027
Apologize? For what?

296
00:31:51,133 --> 00:31:54,034
It was Ed who twisted us off.

297
00:31:54,136 --> 00:31:57,071
<i>I know that. We all do.</i>

298
00:31:59,642 --> 00:32:03,203
I'm offering you your job back,
Steven, if you still want it.

299
00:32:03,312 --> 00:32:06,281
I don't want it, Matthew.

300
00:32:06,382 --> 00:32:11,911
<i>Steven, people make mistakes. They
Mistakes?</i>

301
00:32:12,021 --> 00:32:15,081
You call it a mistake.
I call it something else.

302
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:17,249
Like what?

303
00:32:17,359 --> 00:32:21,489
Like I wonder if you and the rest would've
been so quick to condemn one of the others.

304
00:32:21,597 --> 00:32:24,657
Well, what are you tryin' to say?

305
00:32:24,767 --> 00:32:28,464
<i>You know damn well what I'm tryin'to say.!
Matthew, they strung me up.</i>

306
00:32:28,570 --> 00:32:32,939
They took a rope, tied it around my ankles,
hoisted me up and let me hang there.

307
00:32:33,042 --> 00:32:36,011
<i>And you
you didn't even talk to me.</i>

308
00:32:36,111 --> 00:32:39,878
You just took it for granted
that ""the faggot'' did it.

309
00:33:07,609 --> 00:33:10,305
Mrs. Blaisdel?
Yes?

310
00:33:10,412 --> 00:33:13,677
It's Ed, from out on the rig.

311
00:33:13,782 --> 00:33:17,616
Oh, Ed. Hi. How are you?
I guess you bet against ever
seeing me in a bookstore, huh?

312
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:20,211
Well What happened
to your face?

313
00:33:20,322 --> 00:33:23,450
Did you get in that accident
out at the drill site?

314
00:33:23,559 --> 00:33:25,720
Oh, didn't Matthew tell you?

315
00:33:25,828 --> 00:33:31,425
Oh, well, him and me,
we had a disagreement, guess you'd call it.

316
00:33:31,533 --> 00:33:35,162
Anyway, I'm not workin' there anymore.
I'm sorry.

317
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:38,831
That's okay. I didn't care for the job.
Tell you the truth, I don't care for your husband.

318
00:33:38,941 --> 00:33:41,967
That doesn't go for you. I mean...

319
00:33:42,077 --> 00:33:46,138
given how you were in that place,
locked up and everything.

320
00:33:46,248 --> 00:33:50,150
I was in a hospital, Ed.
I wasn't locked up.

321
00:33:50,252 --> 00:33:54,052
There's a difference.
Well, whatever.

322
00:33:54,156 --> 00:33:57,648
Well, still, it can't be too much fun
bein' married to Matthew...

323
00:33:59,161 --> 00:34:02,221
behavin' the way he does.

324
00:34:02,331 --> 00:34:04,765
And how does he behave, Ed?

325
00:34:06,668 --> 00:34:10,001
You mean to say you don't know?
[ Huffs ]

326
00:34:10,105 --> 00:34:13,006
<i>Hey, l Do you got a book on orchids?</i>

327
00:34:13,108 --> 00:34:16,475
I got a friend tells me
that I should have a hobby...

328
00:34:16,578 --> 00:34:19,342
you know, something to do
in my spare time?

329
00:34:19,448 --> 00:34:21,780
And he says that to raise orchids
is really pretty easy.

330
00:34:21,884 --> 00:34:24,853
All you have to have is a little moss
and a little, um

331
00:34:24,953 --> 00:34:28,946
Ed, look, you came here to tell me something,
so why don't you just tell me?

332
00:34:31,393 --> 00:34:33,486
Well, um...

333
00:34:33,595 --> 00:34:38,623
all the time
that you were in that place, you know...

334
00:34:38,734 --> 00:34:42,465
your fairhaired Matthew Blaisdel,
he was foolin' around with another woman.

335
00:34:46,041 --> 00:34:48,942
<i>I mean, everybody knew about it...</i>

336
00:34:49,044 --> 00:34:52,480
<i>and I just figured
that you got a perfect right to know too.</i>

337
00:34:55,050 --> 00:34:58,747
You're a fine credit
to the human race, Ed.

338
00:34:58,854 --> 00:35:02,585
<i>You really deserve a medal.</i>

339
00:35:02,691 --> 00:35:08,220
What woman?
[ Stuttering ] Well, maybe I said too much already.

340
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:10,992
What woman, Ed?

341
00:35:12,734 --> 00:35:16,932
Well, the one that
is married to Blake Carrington.

342
00:35:19,208 --> 00:35:21,699
<i>Name of Krystle.</i>

343
00:35:31,487 --> 00:35:33,819
You all right, Ms. Blaisdel?

344
00:35:33,922 --> 00:35:36,186
Get the hell out of here, Ed.

345

Mr. Ted Dinard,
please report to the front desk.

<i>[ On P.A.] Mr. Ted Dinard,

<i>Will Mr. Ted Dinard
please report to the front desk?</i>

352
00:36:17,266 --> 00:36:21,362
Hi. I'm Ted Dinard.
Oh, yes, sir. That young lady right there.

353
00:36:23,906 --> 00:36:26,374
Hi. I'm Fallon Colby.

354
00:36:26,475 --> 00:36:28,500
Steven Carrington's sister.

355
00:36:30,779 --> 00:36:33,839
Hello.
Hello.

356
00:36:33,949 --> 00:36:37,680
I happen to know you're
on your way to San Francisco from L.A.

357
00:36:37,786 --> 00:36:40,414
Why don't you just turn in your ticket
and let me give you a lift?

358
00:37:02,778 --> 00:37:07,613
You know, somehow I always imagined that
the private Carrington jet would be a 7 47.

359
00:37:07,716 --> 00:37:11,049
Well, we thought about it,
but we figured it might be a bit much.

360
00:37:11,153 --> 00:37:13,781
Besides, who wants to climb stairs?
Oh?

361
00:37:13,889 --> 00:37:16,756
I thought you and my brother
lived together for a while in a walkup.

362
00:37:16,858 --> 00:37:20,521
Perry Street, wasn't it?
Yes. Perry Street.

363
00:37:20,629 --> 00:37:24,725
I still live there.
You don't sound like a New Yorker.

364
00:37:24,833 --> 00:37:29,031
You're not, are you?
I'm from North Dakota originally.

365
00:37:29,137 --> 00:37:32,732
But I never really felt I belonged there.
Because you're gay?

366
00:37:35,077 --> 00:37:37,477
No. I hated the weather.

367
00:37:37,579 --> 00:37:40,139
Oh.

368
00:37:44,453 --> 00:37:47,547
Thank you.
You're welcome.

369
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:01,863
Fallon, you're not spending $50 a minute
on fuel to talk to me...

370
00:38:01,970 --> 00:38:03,904
about geography and cold winters.

371
00:38:04,006 --> 00:38:09,171
Oh, don't let that worry you. We fly this crate
around whenever, wherever we want.

372
00:38:09,277 --> 00:38:13,338
It's a tax writeoff.
You want me out of your brother's life.

373
00:38:13,448 --> 00:38:18,579
Yes, I do.
And if you care about him at all, you will.

374
00:38:18,687 --> 00:38:21,656
Why? Can you tell me why?

375
00:38:22,924 --> 00:38:25,688
Because you're
gonna cost him everything.

376
00:38:25,794 --> 00:38:30,595
Because someday he's gonna
say he threw it all away.
Threw what away, Fallon?

377
00:38:30,699 --> 00:38:34,465
<i>His father's love, for one thing,
and his father's respect.</i>

378
00:38:34,569 --> 00:38:37,936
Steven may not care to admit that,
but he wants it very much.

379
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:41,476
Hmm. Not to mention
the Carrington power.

380
00:38:41,576 --> 00:38:47,208
That too.
Mm. Power to do what, Fallon? Make a fortune?

381
00:38:47,315 --> 00:38:49,476
That, yes.

382
00:38:49,584 --> 00:38:54,078
You know, you don't even allow
that Steven maybe

383
00:38:54,189 --> 00:38:57,989
just maybe
doesn't want the power or the money.

384
00:38:58,093 --> 00:39:00,926
Ted, Steven comes from a world...

385
00:39:01,029 --> 00:39:04,089
where culls and cripples
and homosexuals...

386
00:39:04,199 --> 00:39:08,067
are taken behind a barn and slaughtered
before they can be given a chance to breed.

387
00:39:13,275 --> 00:39:17,541
There is a certain charm about you,
you know that?

388
00:39:17,646 --> 00:39:19,910
Well, I'm sorry,
but that's just the way it is.

389
00:39:25,487 --> 00:39:28,320
Fallon, who the hell
is more perverted

390
00:39:28,423 --> 00:39:32,484
me or Blake Carrington,
who goes around crushing human souls?

391
00:39:32,594 --> 00:39:36,360
<i>I read about him, hear about him
strangling corporations...</i>

392
00:39:36,465 --> 00:39:39,491
<i>the people inside those corporations,
and for what, Fallon?</i>

393
00:39:39,601 --> 00:39:44,595
More money? I mean,
how many millions does he have to have?

394
00:39:44,706 --> 00:39:50,406
Me, I'm not askin' for a whole lot out
of life. Steven isn't asking for much either.

395
00:39:50,512 --> 00:39:54,642
Don't you think Steven has the right to
choose what kind of life he's going to live?

396
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:57,685
Don't you think you should
at least give him some more time?

397
00:39:57,786 --> 00:40:01,552
You're not going anyplace,
except right now to San Francisco.

398
00:40:05,994 --> 00:40:07,962
Fallon

399
00:40:10,465 --> 00:40:13,093
Fallon, have you ever
loved anybody?

400
00:40:13,201 --> 00:40:17,900
<i>Well, of course. I
I mean, really loved somebody.</i>

401
00:40:18,006 --> 00:40:21,100
More than money or power

402
00:40:23,111 --> 00:40:25,272
more than your own life even.

403
00:40:28,717 --> 00:40:31,117
I'm sorry. I guess I haven't.

404
00:40:32,954 --> 00:40:37,254
It's all right. Don't be sorry.
You're probably lucky.

405
00:40:38,894 --> 00:40:41,226
<i>One more question.</i>

406
00:40:42,764 --> 00:40:46,359
Have you ever had the lobster
at Nat's in San Francisco?

407
00:40:46,468 --> 00:40:48,493
No, I haven't.

408
00:40:48,603 --> 00:40:53,131
Would you join me? I mean, since
neither one of us seems to be ""going anyplace''?

409
00:40:54,409 --> 00:40:56,741
Hmm?

410
00:41:14,529 --> 00:41:16,497
Hi.

411
00:41:21,436 --> 00:41:27,238
You know, I've been thinkin'
about what we were talkin' about.

412
00:41:44,025 --> 00:41:47,392
Well, you know, the business
of going to see Dr.Jordan together.

413
00:41:47,495 --> 00:41:51,295
I, uh I think maybe
I'm ready to give it a shot.

414
00:41:52,767 --> 00:41:55,998
I don't want to.
But it was your idea.

415
00:41:57,105 --> 00:42:00,074
I've changed my mind.

416
00:42:00,175 --> 00:42:04,077
What do you mean, you changed your mind?
Is somethin' somethin' wrong?

417
00:42:06,214 --> 00:42:10,480
Ed, your drilleryour exdriller
came to see me today at the bookstore.

418
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:15,346
Yeah? What'd he want?

419
00:42:15,457 --> 00:42:18,051
Wanted to talk to me.
About what?

420
00:42:24,833 --> 00:42:26,801
Orchids.

421
00:42:27,836 --> 00:42:29,895
Orchids?

422
00:42:30,005 --> 00:42:33,600
I'm going to bed, Matthew.
I'm gonna turn out the light.

423
00:44:17,979 --> 00:44:22,746
Sorry I'm late, darling, but you know
how the girls are when we get together.

424
00:44:26,254 --> 00:44:28,848
Blake, are you all right?

425
00:44:32,727 --> 00:44:34,695
Blake?

426
00:44:56,851 --> 00:45:02,084
This what you looking for?
Your birth control pills?

427
00:45:03,458 --> 00:45:06,018
<i>[ Case Snaps Open ]
She loves me.</i>

428
00:45:06,127 --> 00:45:09,426
[ Snaps ]
She loves me not.

429
00:45:09,531 --> 00:45:13,592
She loves me.
She loves me not.

430
00:45:13,701 --> 00:45:16,431
What are you doing?
Doing what?

431
00:45:16,538 --> 00:45:22,067
Why are you doing that?
I thought we had some kind
of an understanding...

432
00:45:22,177 --> 00:45:25,943
something we were
going to share...

433
00:45:26,047 --> 00:45:28,641
a child that we were
gonna have together...

434
00:45:28,750 --> 00:45:33,585
a child that we both wanted
very, very much.

435
00:45:35,890 --> 00:45:41,089
Blake, I need some time
to sort things out.

436
00:45:41,196 --> 00:45:44,723
Sort things out? I thought you knew everything
about me before we got married

437
00:45:47,435 --> 00:45:50,461
<i>about my desire for that child.</i>

438
00:45:55,376 --> 00:46:00,871
Is it that I'm surrounded
by people who can only betray me...

439
00:46:00,982 --> 00:46:05,112
people who say that they believe in me
and then don't?

440
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:08,519
My son is in love
with another man.

441
00:46:08,623 --> 00:46:11,524
My daughter is in love with sex.

442
00:46:11,626 --> 00:46:15,722
She's probably still sleeping with every player
on my football team. My wife

443
00:46:17,999 --> 00:46:21,162
Who knows what my wife
is doing behind my back.

444
00:46:21,269 --> 00:46:24,534
What are you doing?

445
00:46:24,639 --> 00:46:27,574
Blake, you don't look well.

446
00:46:27,675 --> 00:46:31,406
I'm gonna call the doctor.
No!

447
00:46:37,185 --> 00:46:39,585
Don't!
Come over here!

448
00:46:39,687 --> 00:46:41,780
Blake!
You're my wife!

449
00:46:41,890 --> 00:46:44,859
You do what I tell you
to do when I tell you to do it.

450
00:46:49,397 --> 00:46:51,661
Blake!

451
00:46:53,434 --> 00:46:56,028
Stop, Blake!

452
00:47:06,848 --> 00:47:08,839
Blake, you're choking me!

453
00:47:12,554 --> 00:47:15,648
No. No.

454
00:47:20,728 --> 00:47:22,855
No!
[ Gasping ]

455
00:47:27,669 --> 00:47:30,832
No! No!
