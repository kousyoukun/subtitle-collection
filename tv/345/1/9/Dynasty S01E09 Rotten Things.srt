<i>Previously on</i> Dynasty...

2
00:00:03,258 --> 00:00:05,657

_

4
00:00:08,562 --> 00:00:10,581
I'll handle it. I always do.

5
00:00:10,616 --> 00:00:11,997
<i>I'll get her the money to relocate.</i>

6
00:00:11,999 --> 00:00:14,399
If anything happens to her,
it is your fault.

7
00:00:14,401 --> 00:00:16,768
I need you to find out all
you can about her sister,

8
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:18,203
Iris Machado.

9
00:00:18,205 --> 00:00:19,704
You were trying to get over Culhane,

10
00:00:19,706 --> 00:00:21,306
and it was harder than you thought.

11
00:00:21,308 --> 00:00:22,707
Didn't you say that we should keep this

12
00:00:22,709 --> 00:00:24,109
strictly business?

13
00:00:24,111 --> 00:00:25,610
We're at work, aren't we?

14
00:00:25,612 --> 00:00:26,945
Ted, hi.

15
00:00:26,947 --> 00:00:27,979
<i>I'd love to see you.</i>

16
00:00:27,981 --> 00:00:29,514
<i>Can be in New York in three hours.</i>

17
00:01:06,361 --> 00:01:09,154
_

18
00:01:28,047 --> 00:01:28,858
Hey.

19
00:01:28,893 --> 00:01:30,374
Liberace?

20
00:01:32,649 --> 00:01:34,148
Grandpa?

21
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:37,018
Wipe your nose and put on some pants.

22
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:38,653
I'm taking you home.

23
00:01:42,892 --> 00:01:46,227
So, did you read our year-end report?

24
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:48,796
I should've learned by now.

25
00:01:48,798 --> 00:01:50,965
Discussing dividends is your version

26
00:01:50,967 --> 00:01:52,667
of an after-sex cigarette.

27
00:01:52,669 --> 00:01:55,002
At least you've moved past the

28
00:01:55,004 --> 00:01:57,038
"this is the last time we do it" speech.

29
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,440
No, this really is the last time.

30
00:01:58,542 --> 00:02:00,575
I don't want people thinking
we're only in business together

31
00:02:00,577 --> 00:02:01,910
because we share a bed.

32
00:02:01,912 --> 00:02:03,178
You mean a couch.

33
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:04,379
Or that desk.

34
00:02:04,381 --> 00:02:06,081
Or the sink.

35
00:02:06,083 --> 00:02:07,415
The only time we leave the office

36
00:02:07,417 --> 00:02:09,117
is to do it on the balcony.

37
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:11,886
Well, had you read the report,
you'd understand why.

38
00:02:11,888 --> 00:02:13,822
We're not profitable yet.

39
00:02:13,824 --> 00:02:17,025
And this... isn't helping.

40
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:19,135
Isn't it?

41
00:02:21,274 --> 00:02:22,831
My mom will be here any minute.

42
00:02:22,833 --> 00:02:25,533
I can't believe I get to spend
the holidays with family.

43
00:02:25,535 --> 00:02:26,901
What, so I'm not family?

44
00:02:26,903 --> 00:02:28,336
I mean the two of you.

45
00:02:28,338 --> 00:02:29,938
Aren't you excited to see your sister?

46
00:02:30,873 --> 00:02:31,840
Of course.

47
00:02:31,842 --> 00:02:34,709
Look, I know it's been a long time,
but we're Machados, Tía.

48
00:02:34,711 --> 00:02:37,011
Okay? We pick up where we left off.

49
00:02:37,593 --> 00:02:38,313
Like this.

50
00:02:41,218 --> 00:02:43,485
Oh. I thought you were my mom.

51
00:02:43,487 --> 00:02:45,887
If I'd raised you,
you wouldn't be wearing that shirt.

52
00:02:47,344 --> 00:02:48,089
So...

53
00:02:48,091 --> 00:02:49,657
The year-end report.

54
00:02:49,659 --> 00:02:51,826
You know, we're a first-year company.

55
00:02:51,828 --> 00:02:53,762
We're expected to end in the red.

56
00:02:53,764 --> 00:02:56,164
When do I ever aim for the expected?

57
00:03:00,539 --> 00:03:01,369
What's wrong?

58
00:03:01,371 --> 00:03:03,705
Did Barneys run out
of turtlenecks again?

59
00:03:04,206 --> 00:03:06,674
Monica.
She's bailing on me for Christmas.

60
00:03:06,676 --> 00:03:08,910
Well, only fair after you
ditched her on Thanksgiving

61
00:03:08,912 --> 00:03:10,111
for that mystery woman.

62
00:03:10,727 --> 00:03:12,647
So... who was she?

63
00:03:12,649 --> 00:03:14,282
Name, age, weight?

64
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:18,219
Come on. You know about my past,
why can't I know about yours?

65
00:03:18,221 --> 00:03:21,289
There was never another woman, Fallon.

66
00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:23,558
I was visiting my dad in prison.

67
00:03:24,832 --> 00:03:26,094
But I thought you cut ties with him.

68
00:03:26,096 --> 00:03:28,263
I'm trying to sew them back together.

69
00:03:28,265 --> 00:03:32,167
And, because of that,
Monica's giving me the cold shoulder.

70
00:03:32,169 --> 00:03:35,770
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

71
00:03:36,514 --> 00:03:37,539
I hope she'll come around.

72
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:40,241
That's about as likely as you
getting us out of the red.

73
00:03:40,243 --> 00:03:42,076
'Tis the season for miracles.

74
00:03:42,078 --> 00:03:43,478
Mmm.

75
00:03:49,786 --> 00:03:51,519
So is your mom as pretty as your aunt?

76
00:03:51,521 --> 00:03:52,687
Gross.

77
00:03:52,689 --> 00:03:54,489
What?

78
00:03:55,992 --> 00:03:58,059
Intervention or surprise party?

79
00:03:58,061 --> 00:03:59,494
Welcome wagon, actually.

80
00:04:00,288 --> 00:04:01,196
Not for you.

81
00:04:01,198 --> 00:04:04,165
Thank God. I was afraid I was
gonna have to act grateful.

82
00:04:04,167 --> 00:04:05,934
My sister's on her way.

83
00:04:05,936 --> 00:04:07,873
Oh, goody. Santa got me what I wanted.

84
00:04:07,908 --> 00:04:09,637
- Another Cristal.
- Fallon.

85
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:11,840
Best behavior.

86
00:04:16,246 --> 00:04:17,479
- Oh.
- Are you kidding me?

87
00:04:17,481 --> 00:04:19,414
I'm sorry to disappoint.

88
00:04:19,416 --> 00:04:22,817
But I believe this is
who you're waiting for.

89
00:04:22,819 --> 00:04:23,985
<i>Feliz Navidad.</i>

90
00:04:23,987 --> 00:04:25,253
Mami.

91
00:04:25,255 --> 00:04:27,088
<i>Oh, mi hijo bello.</i>

92
00:04:31,033 --> 00:04:33,923
_

93
00:04:37,834 --> 00:04:40,802
So, this is where you live, huh?

94
00:04:40,804 --> 00:04:43,671
Oh, the ride up the driveway
was longer than my flight.

95
00:04:43,673 --> 00:04:46,341
And who puts a pool next to a lake?

96
00:04:46,343 --> 00:04:47,609
This guy.

97
00:04:47,611 --> 00:04:50,979
- Hi.
- Blake Carrington.

98
00:04:50,981 --> 00:04:52,847
Thank you so much for everything.

99
00:04:52,849 --> 00:04:55,517
The invitation, those little sandwiches

100
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:56,918
on your fancy plane.

101
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,152
Mami, this is, uh...

102
00:04:58,154 --> 00:05:00,388
Fallon. I've heard about you.

103
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:02,290
I can only imagine.

104
00:05:02,292 --> 00:05:03,691
Oh.

105
00:05:03,693 --> 00:05:05,693
Must be nice having
your mom for Christmas.

106
00:05:05,695 --> 00:05:07,495
Best gift anyone can give is family.

107
00:05:07,497 --> 00:05:11,232
Yes. Other than a trust
fund and personal space.

108
00:05:11,912 --> 00:05:15,336
Okay, Google,
how do I say "space" in Spanish?

109
00:05:15,338 --> 00:05:17,839
<i>- Espacio.</i>
- Okay, we got it.

110
00:05:17,841 --> 00:05:19,140
If you'll follow me,
I've had Mrs. Gunnerson

111
00:05:19,142 --> 00:05:20,508
arrange lunch for you.

112
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:23,278
Double helpings,
in case mother eats like son.

113
00:05:25,849 --> 00:05:27,415
And you've hidden the silverware?

114
00:05:27,417 --> 00:05:28,917
All locked away.

115
00:05:28,919 --> 00:05:30,685
Ho, ho, ho.

116
00:05:30,687 --> 00:05:32,587
- Dad?
- Grandpa?

117
00:05:32,589 --> 00:05:34,122
I come bearing gifts.

118
00:05:35,258 --> 00:05:37,559
At least, I'm returning one.

119
00:05:37,561 --> 00:05:39,727
It's the thought that counts, right?

120
00:05:39,729 --> 00:05:42,096
Steven.

121
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,599
How was New York?

122
00:05:44,601 --> 00:05:46,234
Any good meetings?

123
00:05:46,236 --> 00:05:48,903
I'm sure Grandpa will fill you in.

124
00:05:48,905 --> 00:05:51,906
He's exhausted from his little jaunt.

125
00:05:51,908 --> 00:05:53,074
You know, harsh weather.

126
00:05:53,076 --> 00:05:56,244
All that snow.

127
00:05:58,341 --> 00:05:59,647
Am I in the right house?

128
00:05:59,649 --> 00:06:01,015
If I'd have known you were coming,
I would've...

129
00:06:01,017 --> 00:06:02,717
You would've hidden the undocumented?

130
00:06:03,419 --> 00:06:06,688
- Thomas, so nice to finally meet you.
- Thank you.

131
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:08,990
Hey... this is my wife, Cristal.

132
00:06:09,671 --> 00:06:10,959
If you'd come to the wedding,
you would've met her.

133
00:06:10,961 --> 00:06:12,493
I did come to your wedding.

134
00:06:12,495 --> 00:06:14,762
The one that wasn't for a green card.

135
00:06:14,764 --> 00:06:16,030
Okay.

136
00:06:16,032 --> 00:06:19,000
Let's get lunch started, shall we?

137
00:06:19,002 --> 00:06:20,435
How's my favorite grandchild?

138
00:06:20,437 --> 00:06:21,636
Busy building an empire.

139
00:06:22,485 --> 00:06:23,271
That's my girl.

140
00:06:23,273 --> 00:06:24,872
- Actually, my girl.
- Well, she was your girl

141
00:06:24,874 --> 00:06:26,808
until you let her go
and leave my company.

142
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:28,042
Actually, my company.

143
00:06:28,044 --> 00:06:30,011
I'm glad you're here, Grandpa.

144
00:06:30,013 --> 00:06:32,213
Thank you.

145
00:06:34,117 --> 00:06:35,450
We need to talk.

146
00:06:46,429 --> 00:06:48,196
Oh, son of a bitch.

147
00:06:48,198 --> 00:06:49,697
Is that cocaine?

148
00:06:49,699 --> 00:06:53,001
Your boy was humping
everyone in New York City,

149
00:06:53,003 --> 00:06:55,136
save the Statue of Liberty,

150
00:06:55,138 --> 00:06:56,904
but I bet if she wore pants...

151
00:06:57,513 --> 00:06:59,040
What, you're spying on my family now?

152
00:06:59,042 --> 00:07:00,642
No, the tabloids are.

153
00:07:00,644 --> 00:07:04,479
My contact reached out,
and I paid to have it killed.

154
00:07:04,481 --> 00:07:06,914
I can't imagine what
another scandal would do

155
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:08,116
to Carrington Atlantic.

156
00:07:08,118 --> 00:07:10,730
A company that I handed you

157
00:07:10,765 --> 00:07:13,454
because I thought you
were ready to lead it.

158
00:07:13,456 --> 00:07:14,922
I have been running a
tight ship for a long time,

159
00:07:14,924 --> 00:07:15,957
and you know it.

160
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:17,158
Yeah, what ship would that be?

161
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,359
The<i> Titanic?</i>

162
00:07:18,361 --> 00:07:20,294
You have a new COO

163
00:07:20,296 --> 00:07:21,896
who shared her naughty bits in public,

164
00:07:21,898 --> 00:07:25,284
you were in the middle of
a murder investigation,

165
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:28,336
and you lost my
granddaughter to Jeff Colby.

166
00:07:28,338 --> 00:07:32,540
Now your son's a
drug-addicted liability.

167
00:07:34,077 --> 00:07:36,611
I want you to fire Steven immediately.

168
00:07:36,613 --> 00:07:38,513
- Oh, how is that gonna help?
- Well, if he's going to get caught,

169
00:07:38,515 --> 00:07:41,816
he won't get caught as the head
of the Carrington Foundation.

170
00:07:41,818 --> 00:07:43,484
I'm not firing my son.

171
00:07:43,486 --> 00:07:46,220
I'll handle him in my own way,
like a father would.

172
00:07:46,222 --> 00:07:48,256
Not that you would know
anything about that.

173
00:07:48,258 --> 00:07:52,160
Well, I'm, I'm sorry,
that you thought that was a suggestion.

174
00:07:52,162 --> 00:07:55,709
I want you to fire Steven,
and if you don't,

175
00:07:55,744 --> 00:07:58,599
I'll contact the board
and have them fire you.

176
00:08:08,887 --> 00:08:12,081
Dad, I'm sorry.
No one is more embarrassed

177
00:08:12,121 --> 00:08:14,521
or concerned than I am.

178
00:08:14,523 --> 00:08:15,356
It was a slip.

179
00:08:15,378 --> 00:08:17,878
And I am ready to forget
all about New York

180
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,748
and just focus on work.

181
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,583
That's not what I want you to do.

182
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:26,553
I don't want you to
forget what happened.

183
00:08:26,555 --> 00:08:28,288
I want you to get the help you need.

184
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:30,657
What, like rehab?

185
00:08:30,659 --> 00:08:31,859
Fine.

186
00:08:31,861 --> 00:08:33,627
Yes, I will go.

187
00:08:33,629 --> 00:08:36,096
If that's what it'll take
for you to trust me again.

188
00:08:36,098 --> 00:08:38,032
That's a start.

189
00:08:38,849 --> 00:08:40,835
Why don't you join your
grandfather and me downstairs?

190
00:08:40,904 --> 00:08:43,103
Uh, you're on your own there.

191
00:08:54,549 --> 00:08:55,916
Frank, hi.

192
00:08:55,918 --> 00:08:57,818
I'm expecting someone at the west gate.

193
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:00,854
Can you ring me when they get here?

194
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:09,530
I take it you saw my budget proposal.

195
00:09:09,532 --> 00:09:11,498
This isn't a proposal, it's a bloodbath.

196
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:14,668
I'm not laying off two-thirds
of my people before Christmas.

197
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:16,336
Oh, well, we can wait until the 26th.

198
00:09:16,338 --> 00:09:17,504
I'm serious, Fallon.

199
00:09:17,506 --> 00:09:18,605
Well, so am I.

200
00:09:18,607 --> 00:09:19,740
I'm only trimming the fat

201
00:09:19,742 --> 00:09:21,041
because we have a balance
sheet to consider.

202
00:09:21,043 --> 00:09:22,443
Scrooge would have done it.

203
00:09:22,445 --> 00:09:25,312
I think you missed the
point of that story.

204
00:09:25,314 --> 00:09:28,215
No company of mine will ever
put profits over people.

205
00:09:28,217 --> 00:09:29,186
End of discussion.

206
00:09:29,218 --> 00:09:31,385
Bah, humbug. But don't worry.

207
00:09:31,387 --> 00:09:34,221
I'm working on another angle.

208
00:09:44,366 --> 00:09:47,234
Damn, the Carringtons really
do keep you around the clock.

209
00:09:47,236 --> 00:09:50,104
Yeah, well,
the end-of-the-year bonus is worth it.

210
00:09:50,106 --> 00:09:51,805
Am I driving you and Fallon today?

211
00:09:51,807 --> 00:09:53,173
'Cause she didn't tell
me anything about that.

212
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:54,641
Well, that makes two of us.

213
00:09:54,643 --> 00:09:57,077
She just said she was
taking me shopping.

214
00:09:57,079 --> 00:09:59,546
Kori told me about your breakup.

215
00:09:59,548 --> 00:10:00,781
I'm sorry to hear it.

216
00:10:00,783 --> 00:10:02,082
Yeah, well, it's my fault.

217
00:10:02,084 --> 00:10:03,417
I thought it was Fallon's.

218
00:10:03,419 --> 00:10:05,119
Mm. No, I make my own choices.

219
00:10:05,121 --> 00:10:06,653
Does Fallon know that?

220
00:10:08,624 --> 00:10:10,390
I'm driving myself today.

221
00:10:10,392 --> 00:10:12,860
That way you won't be stuck
with us if I take too long.

222
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:14,261
You're too kind.

223
00:10:17,066 --> 00:10:19,266
I can even get my own door.

224
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:25,439
Not sure where his holiday spirit is.

225
00:10:25,441 --> 00:10:26,974
It's not like he's lonely.

226
00:10:27,966 --> 00:10:29,176
Are you?

227
00:10:30,124 --> 00:10:31,178
I'm fine.

228
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:32,646
I'm evolving.

229
00:10:33,134 --> 00:10:34,581
That's mature.

230
00:10:35,224 --> 00:10:37,518
It's a pain in the ass.

231
00:10:45,109 --> 00:10:48,095
I bet you're thinking,
"Could've been me", right?

232
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:54,868
So, Iris,
Cristal tells me it's been 12 years

233
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:56,303
since you've seen each other?

234
00:10:56,305 --> 00:10:58,003
And six since I've seen my boy.

235
00:10:58,074 --> 00:11:01,041
I couldn't manage being
away from my kids that long.

236
00:11:01,043 --> 00:11:02,228
You do what it takes.

237
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:04,811
Actually, Thomas, I regret it.

238
00:11:04,813 --> 00:11:09,850
I regret every day that I
wasn't around to see my son

239
00:11:09,852 --> 00:11:12,786
become this amazing,
beautiful, young man.

240
00:11:12,788 --> 00:11:14,188
Oh, stop it.

241
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:15,622
But, like, don't.

242
00:11:16,094 --> 00:11:18,091
I won't make that mistake again.

243
00:11:18,093 --> 00:11:19,359
I want to stay in America.

244
00:11:19,361 --> 00:11:20,894
- What?
- What?

245
00:11:20,896 --> 00:11:24,231
Maybe I'll apply for a job
at Carrington Atlantic.

246
00:11:24,647 --> 00:11:25,832
Smart move.

247
00:11:25,834 --> 00:11:28,035
I hear they're taking anyone these days.

248
00:11:28,037 --> 00:11:29,937
I'm hoping you have some pull.

249
00:11:30,402 --> 00:11:32,906
I could move here
legally on a work visa,

250
00:11:32,908 --> 00:11:36,376
stop depending on Cristal's
money and your kindness, Blake.

251
00:11:36,378 --> 00:11:38,245
I like to work hard for what I have.

252
00:11:38,247 --> 00:11:39,913
I can type.

253
00:11:39,915 --> 00:11:42,349
I'm good on the phone.

254
00:11:42,351 --> 00:11:45,219
Anyway, it's just an idea.

255
00:11:45,221 --> 00:11:47,221
Not that you've given
it a lot of thought.

256
00:11:47,223 --> 00:11:48,482
Obviously.

257
00:11:48,524 --> 00:11:51,124
Well, I'd have to run it by the COO.

258
00:11:54,373 --> 00:11:55,662
I can't do it.

259
00:11:55,664 --> 00:11:57,164
I can't believe you lied to me.

260
00:11:57,166 --> 00:11:57,937
Oh, yeah, I know.

261
00:11:57,967 --> 00:11:59,900
No one should ever lie about shopping.

262
00:11:59,902 --> 00:12:01,134
I knew if you had

263
00:12:01,136 --> 00:12:03,136
too much time to think about it,
you wouldn't come.

264
00:12:03,138 --> 00:12:05,772
- I'm barely here now.
- Well, you have to stay.

265
00:12:05,774 --> 00:12:07,708
I mean, I even called up
ahead to set up a visit.

266
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:08,709
- Fallon.
- When I saw Cristal

267
00:12:08,711 --> 00:12:10,978
and her Sears catalog family,

268
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,046
they just seemed so
happy to be reunited.

269
00:12:13,048 --> 00:12:14,681
And I know that Jeff was
crushed when he heard

270
00:12:14,683 --> 00:12:16,283
you were bailing on your
family for Christmas.

271
00:12:16,285 --> 00:12:18,018
I can't believe Jeff told you.

272
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:20,487
- That wasn't his decision to make.
- Don't be mad at him.

273
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:22,889
I just know that when my
dad shut me out for a week,

274
00:12:22,891 --> 00:12:25,262
I couldn't stand it. I can't imagine
losing him for ten years.

275
00:12:25,294 --> 00:12:28,996
That's right. You can't imagine.

276
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:30,964
- Mommy.
- Shh.

277
00:12:30,966 --> 00:12:33,533
Prisoner 2F529.

278
00:12:33,535 --> 00:12:34,434
Ready for you.

279
00:12:34,436 --> 00:12:36,136
No.

280
00:12:36,138 --> 00:12:38,905
Look, this was your idea.

281
00:12:38,907 --> 00:12:40,941
You go see the bastard yourself.
I'm out.

282
00:12:42,076 --> 00:12:44,911
No! No!

283
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:55,956
Did anyone see you come in?

284
00:12:55,958 --> 00:12:57,724
Yeah, just that guy Frank at the gate.

285
00:12:57,726 --> 00:12:59,893
He's an old friend and my drug hookup,

286
00:12:59,895 --> 00:13:02,029
so his lips are sealed.

287
00:13:03,832 --> 00:13:06,233
So, uh, where are we going?

288
00:13:06,235 --> 00:13:09,002
Oh, Betty Ford, allegedly,

289
00:13:09,004 --> 00:13:12,706
but pick a place on Earth
and that's where we'll be.

290
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:15,676
My friend, Jeff, offered us his
plane so we won't have to deal

291
00:13:15,678 --> 00:13:17,311
with airport security or my father.

292
00:13:18,147 --> 00:13:19,846
Paris for New Year's?

293
00:13:41,807 --> 00:13:45,272
Not every day some Buckhead
Betty rolls up in here.

294
00:13:45,274 --> 00:13:46,306
You lonely, honey?

295
00:13:46,874 --> 00:13:48,542
I'm sorry to disappoint,

296
00:13:48,544 --> 00:13:50,310
but I'm not one of those crazy nutjobs

297
00:13:50,312 --> 00:13:51,878
who falls for guys in prison.

298
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:55,649
Cute jacket.

299
00:13:55,651 --> 00:13:57,384
So, you mind telling me
what this is all about then?

300
00:13:57,386 --> 00:13:59,386
I'm a close friend of Jeff and Monica's.

301
00:13:59,388 --> 00:14:01,188
She was actually coming
here to visit you today.

302
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:02,255
Why?

303
00:14:02,257 --> 00:14:04,024
Well, she is your daughter.

304
00:14:04,026 --> 00:14:05,425
And she's not welcome here.

305
00:14:07,796 --> 00:14:10,797
You know, people say I'm the
one that convinced Chelsea

306
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:13,367
and Ivanka to make up,
so I'm sure I can negotiate a treaty

307
00:14:13,369 --> 00:14:15,802
- between you and Monica.
- I'm sorry, but who the hell are you?

308
00:14:15,804 --> 00:14:17,604
Well, I'm her friend. Fallon Carrington.

309
00:14:18,937 --> 00:14:20,140
You're Blake's daughter.

310
00:14:20,142 --> 00:14:21,808
No. He's my father.

311
00:14:21,811 --> 00:14:25,078
- It's just I've known Jeff and Monica since...
- Get out.

312
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,747
- Get the hell out.
- Let's go.

313
00:14:26,749 --> 00:14:29,082
Get your ass out of here!
Never come back again, you hear me?

314
00:14:29,084 --> 00:14:31,385
And stay away from my kids!

315
00:14:41,713 --> 00:14:42,513
Wait, is that...

316
00:14:45,802 --> 00:14:46,884
Tía, you have to see this.

317
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:49,120
It's an album that my mom
brought from when you were kids.

318
00:14:49,522 --> 00:14:50,855
I can't believe you have all these.

319
00:14:50,857 --> 00:14:52,223
Why would you do that?

320
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:53,624
Asking Blake for a job?

321
00:14:53,626 --> 00:14:55,059
How could you?

322
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:56,861
I didn't ask him for your job.

323
00:14:56,863 --> 00:14:59,585
Because you couldn't
do my job or any job.

324
00:14:59,599 --> 00:15:01,966
As if you know anything about me.

325
00:15:01,968 --> 00:15:03,734
After you left, you barely looked back.

326
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:06,070
You don't know what I did for money.

327
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:08,572
I can certainly handle
a simple secretary job.

328
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:09,940
Secretarial.

329
00:15:09,942 --> 00:15:11,442
Oh, my God, who cares?

330
00:15:11,444 --> 00:15:13,277
Point is, if she got work,
she could stay.

331
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:14,912
- No, she can't.
- Why?

332
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:15,989
We just got her here.

333
00:15:16,016 --> 00:15:18,782
She's been on the run for 12
years for money you both stole.

334
00:15:18,784 --> 00:15:21,085
Look at the life you got.

335
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,720
I can't go back to Venezuela.

336
00:15:22,722 --> 00:15:24,655
I can't.

337
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:27,057
I just want to start over like you did,

338
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:29,260
here, with my son.

339
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:32,630
Why is that so hard
for you to understand?

340
00:15:34,248 --> 00:15:35,666
She doesn't want your life.

341
00:15:35,668 --> 00:15:37,334
She just wants us.

342
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:50,447
Have you handled Steven yet?

343
00:15:51,518 --> 00:15:52,750
Timing's crucial, son.

344
00:15:52,752 --> 00:15:54,985
We can bury the news
during the holiday season

345
00:15:54,987 --> 00:15:57,021
when the news cycle slows down.

346
00:15:57,023 --> 00:15:59,156
That won't be necessary.

347
00:15:59,158 --> 00:16:00,157
He slipped,

348
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:01,225
he knows he's wrong,

349
00:16:01,227 --> 00:16:02,860
and he assured me he'll go to rehab.

350
00:16:02,862 --> 00:16:05,062
I didn't raise you to be a fool, Blake.

351
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:08,265
And you didn't raise my son.

352
00:16:08,267 --> 00:16:10,034
I know him.

353
00:16:10,036 --> 00:16:11,502
I know how to get through to him

354
00:16:11,504 --> 00:16:12,836
and he understands my concerns.

355
00:16:12,838 --> 00:16:14,071
Believe it or not,

356
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:15,906
it'll work better than your approach.

357
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:17,708
- You'll see.
- Really?

358
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:19,743
Nobody has to be fired.

359
00:16:25,221 --> 00:16:28,118
Well, tell that to the Ken doll
sneaking out of the east wing.

360
00:16:37,697 --> 00:16:39,563
Something wrong with the front door?

361
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:41,832
It was you, wasn't it?

362
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:43,634
You dragged him with you to New York.

363
00:16:43,636 --> 00:16:45,269
Steven came to me.

364
00:16:45,271 --> 00:16:47,071
Look, you know he doesn't do
anything he doesn't want...

365
00:16:47,073 --> 00:16:48,105
This wouldn't have happened

366
00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:49,406
if you hadn't come back into his life.

367
00:16:49,408 --> 00:16:51,141
What's it gonna be?

368
00:16:52,203 --> 00:16:53,677
Will 50 grand do it this time?

369
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:56,580
Ah, there's the Blake Carrington I know.

370
00:16:56,582 --> 00:16:59,083
Yeah, he doesn't get his way,
he throws money at the problem.

371
00:16:59,085 --> 00:17:01,854
You know what?
How about that or this golf club?

372
00:17:01,889 --> 00:17:02,920
You pick.

373
00:17:04,003 --> 00:17:06,056
Mr. Carrington,

374
00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:08,192
you know what the
first step of rehab is?

375
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:11,395
It's finally admitting
that you're powerless.

376
00:17:21,641 --> 00:17:22,973
You told Fallon?

377
00:17:22,975 --> 00:17:24,575
What are you talking about?

378
00:17:24,577 --> 00:17:26,377
Your little business partner
just took me on a field trip

379
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:28,078
to Atlanta North State Correctional.

380
00:17:28,739 --> 00:17:30,848
You know how messed up things
are between Dad and me.

381
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:32,650
You know I don't want
that out in the world.

382
00:17:32,652 --> 00:17:33,784
I didn't tell the world

383
00:17:33,786 --> 00:17:35,819
and I wasn't trying to hurt you.

384
00:17:35,821 --> 00:17:37,621
Fallon was asking me about it.

385
00:17:37,623 --> 00:17:39,256
She thought I was with some girl, so...

386
00:17:39,258 --> 00:17:40,824
Who cares?

387
00:17:42,857 --> 00:17:44,662
Oh, my God, you're sleeping with her?

388
00:17:44,664 --> 00:17:47,197
So, I have bad news.

389
00:17:47,199 --> 00:17:49,466
Looks like you already know it.

390
00:17:49,468 --> 00:17:50,968
I'm sorry, okay?

391
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:53,003
I-I-I didn't mean to put
you in an awkward position.

392
00:17:53,005 --> 00:17:55,272
By bringing me to see my dad
or by screwing my brother?

393
00:17:55,274 --> 00:17:56,440
Monica, please.

394
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:57,608
It's not a big deal.

395
00:17:57,610 --> 00:17:59,243
We agreed to keep it low-key

396
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:00,577
to avoid drama.

397
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:02,012
We agreed not to tell anyone about Dad.

398
00:18:02,014 --> 00:18:03,847
Guess low-key isn't your strong suit.

399
00:18:03,849 --> 00:18:06,850
I understand you're upset,
but I'm a grown-ass man, Monica.

400
00:18:06,852 --> 00:18:08,385
I don't need you vetting
who I sleep with.

401
00:18:08,387 --> 00:18:09,953
It's not like you listen, anyway.

402
00:18:09,955 --> 00:18:12,256
Luckily, she'll soon be back
with her boy toy driver,

403
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:13,424
now that he's single.

404
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:14,858
Culhane broke up with Kori?

405
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:17,795
Obviously, he didn't tell you.

406
00:18:17,797 --> 00:18:19,830
Maybe 'cause he's learned
to avoid all her drama.

407
00:18:19,832 --> 00:18:22,399
Why haven't we?

408
00:18:29,742 --> 00:18:32,543
Homemade alfajores.

409
00:18:32,545 --> 00:18:35,145
I figured the olive branch
could use an upgrade.

410
00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:38,148
So, you made those... treats?

411
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:43,087
I thought Mrs. Gunnerson had
some sort of psychotic break.

412
00:18:44,657 --> 00:18:46,857
Oh.

413
00:18:50,134 --> 00:18:52,066
Healthy sum for a peasant.

414
00:18:52,101 --> 00:18:53,497
She's not a peasant.

415
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:56,066
And that's probably the last
of the money that I sent her.

416
00:18:56,068 --> 00:18:57,768
American cash is king in Venezuela.

417
00:18:57,770 --> 00:19:02,072
This particular cash
has been marked by me

418
00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:03,674
in case those fish-head
goons we paid off

419
00:19:03,676 --> 00:19:04,908
come back and cause trouble.

420
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:06,009
But how would she have
gotten that money?

421
00:19:06,011 --> 00:19:08,512
I don't under...

422
00:19:09,942 --> 00:19:11,682
My own sister tried to rob me.

423
00:19:11,684 --> 00:19:13,984
Must be genetic.

424
00:19:17,711 --> 00:19:20,584
Threats, extortion, blackmail.

425
00:19:20,586 --> 00:19:22,485
I can't believe Iris would do this.

426
00:19:23,116 --> 00:19:23,920
Between the two of you,

427
00:19:23,922 --> 00:19:27,057
is there a commandment
you haven't broken?

428
00:19:27,059 --> 00:19:30,227
The literal buck,
as they say, stops here.

429
00:19:30,229 --> 00:19:31,962
We are taking this to Blake.

430
00:19:31,964 --> 00:19:34,130
No. I'm going to my sister first.

431
00:19:34,132 --> 00:19:36,233
I just need time to
think things through.

432
00:19:36,235 --> 00:19:37,801
Time just helps her.

433
00:19:37,803 --> 00:19:40,570
If she really scammed us for $300,000,

434
00:19:40,572 --> 00:19:42,272
who's to say she's finished?

435
00:19:42,274 --> 00:19:44,274
I'm not letting her leave with a dime.

436
00:19:44,276 --> 00:19:45,609
But, please, Anders,

437
00:19:45,611 --> 00:19:47,410
you have to let me handle
this myself this time.

438
00:19:48,194 --> 00:19:49,446
Oh, I miss the old days

439
00:19:49,448 --> 00:19:52,215
when all you had was a dead ex-lover.

440
00:19:53,952 --> 00:19:56,720
In my defense, I didn't know
your dad had a problem with her.

441
00:19:56,722 --> 00:19:58,955
You kind of left out that
critical information.

442
00:19:58,957 --> 00:20:00,590
If I'd have thought
you were gonna do that,

443
00:20:00,592 --> 00:20:02,692
I'd have kept lying about
my imaginary girlfriend.

444
00:20:02,694 --> 00:20:04,194
Was it so hard to believe

445
00:20:04,196 --> 00:20:05,729
I'd want to do something
nice for you and Monica?

446
00:20:06,498 --> 00:20:08,665
Well, and me, but mostly you.

447
00:20:08,667 --> 00:20:10,400
I mean, after you told me
about your father,

448
00:20:10,402 --> 00:20:12,802
I also started thinking about prisons.

449
00:20:12,804 --> 00:20:16,406
Those things are open
24/7, 365 days a year,

450
00:20:16,408 --> 00:20:18,275
and they need power.

451
00:20:18,277 --> 00:20:19,676
So I called to set a meeting

452
00:20:19,678 --> 00:20:21,478
with the Atlanta operations manager

453
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:24,314
who oversees where your dad is,
but he wouldn't take my call.

454
00:20:24,316 --> 00:20:26,349
That's why you took Monica with you?

455
00:20:26,351 --> 00:20:27,751
To stage a run-in?

456
00:20:27,753 --> 00:20:29,552
Well, I needed
a visitor's badge to get in.

457
00:20:29,554 --> 00:20:31,154
I figured I would find
the operations manager

458
00:20:31,156 --> 00:20:32,289
while she was with your dad.

459
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:33,823
You know, two birds, one stone.

460
00:20:33,825 --> 00:20:37,027
Fix your family and fix
our books with a new deal.

461
00:20:37,029 --> 00:20:39,262
But when Monica bailed,
I had to explain to your dad

462
00:20:39,264 --> 00:20:41,031
what happened and I missed the guy.

463
00:20:41,033 --> 00:20:43,833
So, now my dad and my sister
are both pissed at me,

464
00:20:43,835 --> 00:20:46,403
and we're still in the red.

465
00:20:46,405 --> 00:20:48,171
Look, I will fix it, okay?

466
00:20:48,173 --> 00:20:50,340
I promise.

467
00:20:50,342 --> 00:20:52,842
That isn't for me, is it?

468
00:20:54,716 --> 00:20:56,179
Not that you deserve it.

469
00:20:57,791 --> 00:20:59,249
No.

470
00:20:59,251 --> 00:21:02,018
No, you're right. I don't.

471
00:21:06,825 --> 00:21:09,225
Don't open it until Christmas.

472
00:21:12,164 --> 00:21:13,930
- Hello?
- You have a collect call

473
00:21:13,932 --> 00:21:15,098
from Fulton County Jail.

474
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,833
Do you wish to accept the charges?

475
00:21:16,835 --> 00:21:18,935
Uh... uh, yeah, sure.

476
00:21:19,983 --> 00:21:22,272
Ah, Steven, thank God. It's Ted.

477
00:21:22,937 --> 00:21:23,807
I'm in jail.

478
00:21:24,362 --> 00:21:25,508
Why? What the hell happened?

479
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:27,811
I got pulled over as soon
as I left your house.

480
00:21:27,813 --> 00:21:29,446
Look, they said
they found drugs in my car,

481
00:21:29,448 --> 00:21:31,448
and now they're trying to
charge me with possession.

482
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:32,682
How much were you carrying?

483
00:21:32,684 --> 00:21:34,451
Nothing. Someone planted it.

484
00:21:35,822 --> 00:21:38,054
Steven, this is my third strike.

485
00:21:38,056 --> 00:21:39,656
I could get real time.

486
00:21:40,692 --> 00:21:44,060
Look, you still know people, don't you?

487
00:21:46,998 --> 00:21:48,714
Even if I wanted to help,

488
00:21:48,749 --> 00:21:49,599
I can't.

489
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:52,602
You pushed my contact out of the force.

490
00:21:52,604 --> 00:21:54,871
Hell, out of the country.

491
00:21:55,393 --> 00:21:58,019
Ted Dinard can rot in
prison for all I care.

492
00:21:58,656 --> 00:22:00,677
You did this, didn't you?

493
00:22:00,679 --> 00:22:02,218
You called the cops.

494
00:22:02,253 --> 00:22:04,147
Please, that's beneath me, Steven.

495
00:22:04,149 --> 00:22:05,682
All of a sudden there's
a line you won't cross?

496
00:22:05,684 --> 00:22:06,716
All of a sudden, I don't have somebody

497
00:22:06,718 --> 00:22:08,376
to cross it for me.

498
00:22:08,411 --> 00:22:09,552
The only person that could

499
00:22:09,554 --> 00:22:11,254
get this done for me is
enjoying early retirement

500
00:22:11,256 --> 00:22:13,623
in the Caribbean, thanks to you.

501
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:15,692
Good news...

502
00:22:15,694 --> 00:22:19,329
you don't need to worry about
when you're gonna see Ted again.

503
00:22:19,331 --> 00:22:22,032
I have a feeling he's gonna
be in Atlanta for a while.

504
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:26,736
Wow.

505
00:22:26,771 --> 00:22:29,739
Someone's feeling generous.

506
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:33,543
Where'd you get the money
to buy all the presents?

507
00:22:33,545 --> 00:22:35,158
I saved up a little.

508
00:22:35,214 --> 00:22:37,313
A little as in $300,000?

509
00:22:39,947 --> 00:22:40,650
Why do you have the money

510
00:22:40,652 --> 00:22:42,819
I gave the blackmailers in your purse?

511
00:22:45,481 --> 00:22:47,090
It was you.

512
00:22:47,092 --> 00:22:49,392
I thought you'd come
up with a lazy excuse,

513
00:22:49,394 --> 00:22:50,827
but you didn't even bother.

514
00:22:51,686 --> 00:22:53,096
You told me

515
00:22:53,098 --> 00:22:55,065
it was getting complicated
to send money every month.

516
00:22:55,067 --> 00:22:57,200
So you forced me to give
it to you all at once

517
00:22:57,202 --> 00:22:58,635
by pretending you're in danger?

518
00:22:58,637 --> 00:23:01,538
It's the only way I knew you cared.

519
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:04,307
12 years I've been on my own.

520
00:23:04,309 --> 00:23:06,876
I lost faith in people,
especially the ones

521
00:23:06,878 --> 00:23:08,445
with enough money to buy a new name,

522
00:23:08,447 --> 00:23:11,047
a new life, a new family.

523
00:23:11,049 --> 00:23:12,282
Were you ever in danger?

524
00:23:12,284 --> 00:23:14,551
I ran from those men for seven years.

525
00:23:14,553 --> 00:23:16,553
And the other five?

526
00:23:16,555 --> 00:23:18,221
You took advantage of our past

527
00:23:18,223 --> 00:23:19,522
and made me think we were at risk

528
00:23:19,524 --> 00:23:21,424
after all that I've done for you.

529
00:23:21,426 --> 00:23:22,692
After all you did?

530
00:23:22,694 --> 00:23:25,095
You were living the good life in America

531
00:23:25,097 --> 00:23:27,497
while I was struggling in Venezuela.

532
00:23:27,499 --> 00:23:29,432
I thought you would never
miss a few extra dollars,

533
00:23:29,434 --> 00:23:32,001
and guess what... I was right.

534
00:23:32,003 --> 00:23:34,571
You have no idea how hard
I worked for that money.

535
00:23:34,573 --> 00:23:36,739
The hours I stayed up
late at night worrying

536
00:23:36,741 --> 00:23:38,708
that Alejandro's bosses were after you.

537
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:40,643
I want you out of here.

538
00:23:40,645 --> 00:23:43,680
On a flight out of Atlanta,
out of our lives.

539
00:23:43,682 --> 00:23:45,815
You think you can just push me out?

540
00:23:45,817 --> 00:23:47,951
- This is my house.
- No, this is Blake's house.

541
00:23:48,951 --> 00:23:51,354
And I know you didn't
really tell him everything,

542
00:23:51,356 --> 00:23:53,957
or Sam wouldn't be here.

543
00:23:54,993 --> 00:23:58,161
If I tell your husband
what really happened,

544
00:23:58,163 --> 00:24:01,064
who do you think will be
on a flight out of Atlanta?

545
00:24:02,134 --> 00:24:03,600
Don't test me, Celia,

546
00:24:03,602 --> 00:24:08,371
or I promise you,
I will tell him everything.

547
00:24:26,087 --> 00:24:29,022
Heard about your tiff with Steven.

548
00:24:29,024 --> 00:24:31,324
Anders' loyalties really do shift

549
00:24:31,326 --> 00:24:32,625
whenever you're home.

550
00:24:32,627 --> 00:24:34,327
Don't know how you
got that boy arrested,

551
00:24:34,329 --> 00:24:38,164
but I'm proud of you for
solving that problem.

552
00:24:38,166 --> 00:24:40,133
I didn't fire Steven.

553
00:24:40,135 --> 00:24:42,202
Oh, you did one better.
Firing him would have

554
00:24:42,204 --> 00:24:43,837
just been a Band-Aid.

555
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:46,039
You cut out the boil by the root.

556
00:24:46,834 --> 00:24:49,409
Unexpected and efficient.

557
00:24:49,411 --> 00:24:52,045
You keep your job for now.

558
00:24:55,217 --> 00:24:56,649
What do you mean they can't release him

559
00:24:56,651 --> 00:24:58,885
until after the holidays?

560
00:24:58,887 --> 00:25:02,555
I know it's Christmas,
but if you're on a retainer, then...

561
00:25:02,557 --> 00:25:05,792
I'll pay overtime...
Just make sure my friend is out.

562
00:25:17,606 --> 00:25:19,305
What's up with you?

563
00:25:19,307 --> 00:25:20,440
I know it's dead wrong,

564
00:25:20,442 --> 00:25:22,976
but I wish I could call Stansfield.

565
00:25:22,978 --> 00:25:25,278
I know, there really are no good deeds.

566
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,479
Hear, hear.

567
00:25:26,481 --> 00:25:27,747
The tree's got bigger balls

568
00:25:27,749 --> 00:25:29,148
- than you do.
- Thank you, Dad.

569
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:31,885
No, serious.

570
00:25:31,887 --> 00:25:33,152
I don't know why I let the ghosts

571
00:25:33,154 --> 00:25:35,622
of Christmas past and present get to me.

572
00:25:35,624 --> 00:25:38,892
Well, maybe we can perform
an exorcism before midnight.

573
00:25:40,202 --> 00:25:41,527
OK Google,

574
00:25:41,529 --> 00:25:43,129
where can I find a priest?

575
00:25:43,131 --> 00:25:45,698
Here are the top search results...

576
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:47,000
How useful.

577
00:25:47,002 --> 00:25:49,502
Yeah. If only it could play CDs.

578
00:25:49,504 --> 00:25:51,504
Getting nostalgic for
your high school mixes?

579
00:25:51,506 --> 00:25:52,872
No. Jeff gave it to me.

580
00:25:53,694 --> 00:25:55,942
Oh, that's personal, for a co-worker.

581
00:25:55,944 --> 00:25:57,844
I gave you mixes.
Don't be weird, Steven.

582
00:25:57,846 --> 00:25:59,612
I haven't had a CD player in years.

583
00:25:59,614 --> 00:26:01,447
Maybe you could ask Culhane.

584
00:26:03,088 --> 00:26:04,522
Well, you two better brighten up

585
00:26:04,557 --> 00:26:05,685
if you want Santa to bring you diamonds

586
00:26:05,687 --> 00:26:07,353
and not lumps of coal.

587
00:26:07,355 --> 00:26:10,056
Our family reunions are a
little more siesta than fiesta.

588
00:26:10,058 --> 00:26:11,491
Well,
this is the first Christmas I've had

589
00:26:11,493 --> 00:26:13,293
with my whole family in 12 years,

590
00:26:13,295 --> 00:26:15,028
so stop sucking all the fun out of it.

591
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:17,363
By all means,
don't cry for me, Argentina.

592
00:26:17,365 --> 00:26:18,898
We're Venezuelan.

593
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:20,066
Just take the win.

594
00:26:20,068 --> 00:26:21,567
Don't let our attitudes ruin things.

595
00:26:21,569 --> 00:26:24,704
Enjoy your family. Someone should.

596
00:26:26,508 --> 00:26:27,674
All right, everyone,

597
00:26:27,676 --> 00:26:29,208
gather 'round.

598
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:32,045
There are a few things that I insist on

599
00:26:32,047 --> 00:26:33,479
during the holiday season,

600
00:26:34,423 --> 00:26:35,848
and this is one of them.

601
00:26:35,850 --> 00:26:39,118
Steven, Fallon,
if you would do me the honor...

602
00:26:42,622 --> 00:26:45,892
We'll start with one
of Grandpa's favorites.

603
00:26:45,894 --> 00:26:47,360
And get it over with.

604
00:26:50,234 --> 00:26:54,767
♪ Good King Wenceslas looked
out on the feast of Stephen ♪

605
00:26:54,769 --> 00:26:57,236

613

They really put the white in
"White Christmas".

614
00:27:48,089 --> 00:27:50,490
- Sam, shh.
- Remind me to make other plans for New Year's.

615
00:27:51,793 --> 00:27:53,159
Wha... what?

616
00:27:53,161 --> 00:27:54,927
What are you doing?

617
00:27:54,929 --> 00:27:56,162
It's supposed to be a party.

618
00:27:56,164 --> 00:27:59,232
Oh, my God.

619
00:28:06,207 --> 00:28:08,541
Whatever racist commentary
is running through your mind,

620
00:28:08,543 --> 00:28:10,009
just keep it to yourself.

621
00:28:10,011 --> 00:28:11,611
I'm not a racist.

622
00:28:11,613 --> 00:28:14,747
I-I was just going to say that
homosexual really can dance.

623
00:28:18,712 --> 00:28:19,619
Perhaps you should remind

624
00:28:19,621 --> 00:28:21,954
your nephew that he should
act like a gentleman.

625
00:28:21,956 --> 00:28:25,058
This party is supposed to honor
the family, not embarrass them.

626
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:28,327
Maybe they need to be
embarrassed more often.

627
00:28:37,405 --> 00:28:39,739
Well, I guess you've got
to admire their passion.

628
00:28:39,741 --> 00:28:41,240
You know what I admire,

629
00:28:41,242 --> 00:28:43,543
the fact that your little
start-up-that-could

630
00:28:43,545 --> 00:28:45,645
might break even first year.

631
00:28:45,647 --> 00:28:48,214
- That's impressive.
- Well, we'll see.

632
00:28:48,216 --> 00:28:50,216
Either way,
it's just the beginning for Morell Corp.

633
00:28:50,218 --> 00:28:51,684
I'd bet on it.

634
00:28:51,686 --> 00:28:54,087
You would've been a star
at Carrington Atlantic

635
00:28:54,089 --> 00:28:57,824
if your dad could've kept his
head out of Selena's skirt.

636
00:29:24,281 --> 00:29:25,299
What's the matter?

637
00:29:25,334 --> 00:29:26,352
You don't like the competition?

638
00:29:26,354 --> 00:29:28,020
I think you've already
caused enough of a scene.

639
00:29:28,022 --> 00:29:30,056
Me? You started it.

640
00:29:30,058 --> 00:29:31,424
Okay, well, now I'm ending it.

641
00:29:31,426 --> 00:29:34,894
You just think that you can
control everything, don't you?

642
00:29:34,929 --> 00:29:37,396
Especially now that you're
just part of this family

643
00:29:37,398 --> 00:29:39,232
and you have all this money,
you just think you can

644
00:29:39,234 --> 00:29:41,292
push me out and take my son.

645
00:29:41,327 --> 00:29:42,769
I didn't take Sam.

646
00:29:42,804 --> 00:29:44,403
He chose to come here.

647
00:29:44,438 --> 00:29:46,250
And after everything
you have done to me,

648
00:29:46,285 --> 00:29:49,111
I can't imagine what kind of mother
you were to him after I left.

649
00:29:49,146 --> 00:29:50,042
I was a good mother.

650
00:29:50,044 --> 00:29:52,612
Bad mothers always say that.

651
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:56,211
Aah!

652
00:29:56,718 --> 00:29:58,151
Oh!

653
00:30:00,288 --> 00:30:02,522
Happy birthday, Jesus.

654
00:30:02,524 --> 00:30:05,224
I never did anything but try
to make your life better!

655
00:30:05,226 --> 00:30:07,593
Is that what you told yourself
when you abandoned us?

656
00:30:07,595 --> 00:30:09,695
When you got in that truck in Caracas?

657
00:30:09,697 --> 00:30:11,397
I had no choice. I needed a doctor.

658
00:30:11,399 --> 00:30:13,599
It's not my fault you never showed up.

659
00:30:13,601 --> 00:30:16,602
Why didn't you?

660
00:30:19,579 --> 00:30:21,674
Because you wanted me to leave.

661
00:30:21,676 --> 00:30:24,243
You blamed me for what
happened that night.

662
00:30:24,245 --> 00:30:26,479
That's why you think I owe you still.

663
00:30:26,481 --> 00:30:27,947
What are you guys talking about?

664
00:30:27,949 --> 00:30:29,148
Go ahead, Cristal,

665
00:30:29,150 --> 00:30:30,550
why don't you tell him?

666
00:30:31,195 --> 00:30:32,518
Why don't you tell everyone?

667
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:35,087
I can't take it anymore, Iris.

668
00:30:35,905 --> 00:30:36,889
<i>Lo siento.</i>

669
00:30:39,422 --> 00:30:40,293
<i>Yo lo hice.</i>

670
00:30:42,697 --> 00:30:44,597
Iris, no.

671
00:30:44,699 --> 00:30:46,465
Iris, no.

672
00:30:59,881 --> 00:31:03,282
No!

673
00:31:14,277 --> 00:31:15,976
_

674
00:31:16,716 --> 00:31:17,463
Samuel...

675
00:31:18,057 --> 00:31:19,432
I killed your father.

676
00:31:43,871 --> 00:31:45,137
You're looking for my mom?

677
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:48,340
Because she left
without saying good-bye.

678
00:31:48,342 --> 00:31:50,175
I'm looking for you, Sam.

679
00:31:50,177 --> 00:31:52,611
I am so sorry.

680
00:31:52,613 --> 00:31:54,746
About your dad, about it all.

681
00:31:54,748 --> 00:31:56,515
You have to know that I never wanted you

682
00:31:56,517 --> 00:31:57,816
to find out in this way.

683
00:31:57,818 --> 00:31:59,518
And how were you hoping I'd find out?

684
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,286
There is not a day that goes by

685
00:32:01,288 --> 00:32:03,622
that I don't wish that I
could change what happened,

686
00:32:03,624 --> 00:32:07,292
or how I handled it.
But your dad was a violent man.

687
00:32:07,294 --> 00:32:09,266
I was protecting your mom and you.

688
00:32:09,364 --> 00:32:12,264
But all these years you let
me think he abandoned me.

689
00:32:12,266 --> 00:32:14,666
I grew up feeling completely worthless,

690
00:32:14,668 --> 00:32:17,769
thinking, "Why should anyone
care about me if my dad didn't".

691
00:32:17,771 --> 00:32:19,438
I care about you, Sam.

692
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,340
And you're not worthless.

693
00:32:21,342 --> 00:32:22,808
You have to know that.

694
00:32:22,810 --> 00:32:25,544
Well, I-I'm glad
you saved my mom that night.

695
00:32:25,546 --> 00:32:27,446
But you robbed me

696
00:32:27,448 --> 00:32:31,083
of the truth about my life
every single day after that.

697
00:32:37,385 --> 00:32:39,125
I know that saying sorry
won't make up for tonight...

698
00:32:39,127 --> 00:32:41,694
Tonight?
What about the last five months?

699
00:32:41,696 --> 00:32:44,897
I know you don't trust me right now,
but please let me explain.

700
00:32:44,899 --> 00:32:47,099
What, just like you did about
your relationship with Matthew?

701
00:32:47,101 --> 00:32:48,976
Or that your real name is Celia?

702
00:32:49,011 --> 00:32:51,656
Or that you stole hundreds
of thousands of dollars?

703
00:32:52,435 --> 00:32:55,772
I know that I have said this before,
but this is it.

704
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:57,543
This is everything, I promise.

705
00:32:57,905 --> 00:33:00,773
And I'm willing to do
whatever it takes to show you

706
00:33:00,775 --> 00:33:02,775
that this is the whole me,

707
00:33:02,777 --> 00:33:06,011
that I love you with my whole heart.

708
00:33:06,013 --> 00:33:08,047
And that is the whole truth.

709
00:33:09,317 --> 00:33:11,350
Can you believe me?

710
00:33:11,352 --> 00:33:12,985
Yes, I believe you.

711
00:33:13,783 --> 00:33:14,820
I believe that you are willing

712
00:33:14,822 --> 00:33:19,792
to do whatever it takes to
put your past behind you.

713
00:33:19,794 --> 00:33:21,794
I just don't know that I am.

714
00:33:21,796 --> 00:33:23,495
What does that mean?

715
00:33:35,176 --> 00:33:36,408
You're up early.

716
00:33:37,611 --> 00:33:39,511
Well, it's hard to rest for Santa

717
00:33:39,513 --> 00:33:42,247
when you have a murderous
stepmom sleeping down the hall.

718
00:33:42,249 --> 00:33:43,882
What's your excuse?

719
00:33:43,884 --> 00:33:46,151
I got you something.

720
00:33:47,321 --> 00:33:49,688
Enjoy memory lane.

721
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:51,824
What are you two reminiscing about?

722
00:33:51,826 --> 00:33:54,460
You know, back in the old days,
we used to hire the help

723
00:33:54,462 --> 00:33:56,662
to make the beds, not sleep in them.

724
00:33:56,664 --> 00:33:58,197
- That's enough.
- I know you think

725
00:33:58,199 --> 00:34:00,866
I'm just an old, white,
closed-minded tight-ass.

726
00:34:00,868 --> 00:34:03,168
- Go on.
- But I was young once.

727
00:34:03,170 --> 00:34:05,938
And a lot like you in some ways.

728
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:08,574
I had my own lost weekend.

729
00:34:08,576 --> 00:34:11,410
Quite a few of them if I'm being honest.

730
00:34:11,412 --> 00:34:15,114
And your great-grandfather
snapped me out of it,

731
00:34:15,116 --> 00:34:16,715
just like I did to you.

732
00:34:16,717 --> 00:34:19,418
- What?
- But that's what this family is, right?

733
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:24,056
We love life, we get drunk,
and we do cocaine with Stevie Nicks.

734
00:34:24,058 --> 00:34:26,518
But we're not kids anymore, Steven.

735
00:34:26,594 --> 00:34:28,861
And your father didn't
get rid of your friend

736
00:34:28,863 --> 00:34:32,064
just so you could go down
that destructive path again.

737
00:34:36,704 --> 00:34:39,438
You couldn't have kept that to yourself?

738
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,607
That was a rotten thing to say.

739
00:34:41,609 --> 00:34:44,243
Sometimes rotten things have to be said.

740
00:34:44,245 --> 00:34:47,079
And done, Carrington style.

741
00:34:48,082 --> 00:34:50,449
Now, I let your father keep his job.

742
00:34:50,451 --> 00:34:52,584
But if you think I'm
gonna let him disobey me

743
00:34:52,586 --> 00:34:55,320
without any consequences,

744
00:34:55,322 --> 00:34:58,424
you're not the smart businesswoman
I always thought you were.

745
00:34:58,426 --> 00:35:00,292
It's called evolving, Grandpa.

746
00:35:00,294 --> 00:35:02,027
You should try it.

747
00:35:02,029 --> 00:35:03,829
Sooner the better.

748
00:35:12,406 --> 00:35:16,275
Well, there's another
Christmas without a good-bye.

749
00:35:16,277 --> 00:35:19,578
Everyone deals with their
families in their own way.

750
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:22,080
Some choose to leave
them during the holidays,

751
00:35:22,082 --> 00:35:24,249
others after a murder.

752
00:35:25,321 --> 00:35:26,919
You chose to bring Iris here

753
00:35:26,921 --> 00:35:29,488
so you'd find out more about Cristal.

754
00:35:29,490 --> 00:35:31,824
I hate to say you got what
you wished for, but...

755
00:35:31,826 --> 00:35:33,425
At least I get my chess partner back.

756
00:35:33,427 --> 00:35:34,793
Hmm.

757
00:35:34,795 --> 00:35:36,428
I bet you miss winning.

758
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:39,231
I only let your father win so
he feels good about himself.

759
00:35:39,233 --> 00:35:42,100
You, on the other hand,
like the challenge.

760
00:35:43,637 --> 00:35:45,904
You did have Ted arrested.

761
00:35:45,906 --> 00:35:47,372
Grandpa just told me.

762
00:35:47,374 --> 00:35:50,175
Good luck with that.

763
00:35:50,177 --> 00:35:51,577
Fool me once, right?

764
00:35:51,579 --> 00:35:53,612
No, I fooled your grandfather.

765
00:35:53,614 --> 00:35:55,747
Steven,
I had nothing to do with Ted's arrest.

766
00:35:55,749 --> 00:35:58,152
Uh, not to say that I minded it.

767
00:35:58,252 --> 00:35:59,785
Why do you keep
defending the guy anyway?

768
00:35:59,787 --> 00:36:01,186
He's nothing but quicksand.

769
00:36:01,188 --> 00:36:02,688
All he's ever done is drag you down.

770
00:36:02,690 --> 00:36:05,090
Ted didn't drag me down.

771
00:36:05,092 --> 00:36:06,859
I dragged him.

772
00:36:06,861 --> 00:36:09,361
You know, you need to stop
blaming other people

773
00:36:09,363 --> 00:36:10,796
for what I do.

774
00:36:10,798 --> 00:36:11,763
I'm trying to protect you.

775
00:36:11,765 --> 00:36:12,898
Been trying my whole life.

776
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:14,566
You really think that helps me?

777
00:36:14,568 --> 00:36:17,870
Blaming other people for my mistakes?

778
00:36:17,872 --> 00:36:19,171
Ted's in jail.

779
00:36:19,173 --> 00:36:20,472
That's where I should be.

780
00:36:20,474 --> 00:36:21,707
You didn't have drugs in your car.

781
00:36:21,709 --> 00:36:24,676
- Stop being a martyr.
- I'm talking about Dominic Ortega.

782
00:36:25,789 --> 00:36:28,031
Stansfield told me before he left town.

783
00:36:28,066 --> 00:36:29,648
I messed up on that rig.

784
00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:32,384
Ortega died,
and you made Matthew cover it up.

785
00:36:33,103 --> 00:36:34,820
It would have ruined you, son.

786
00:36:34,822 --> 00:36:36,788
Well...

787
00:36:36,790 --> 00:36:38,991
now it's ruined us.

788
00:36:43,197 --> 00:36:45,831
Hey.

789
00:36:47,134 --> 00:36:48,467
Thank you for coming.

790
00:36:48,469 --> 00:36:49,835
If you just wanted to apologize again,

791
00:36:49,837 --> 00:36:51,403
you could've done that on the phone.

792
00:36:51,405 --> 00:36:52,905
Well, then I couldn't
have given you this.

793
00:36:54,408 --> 00:36:56,675
The Colby Kids Fund?

794
00:36:56,677 --> 00:36:58,810
It's a nonprofit endowment that
provides transportation vouchers

795
00:36:58,812 --> 00:37:01,346
for children to visit
their incarcerated parents.

796
00:37:01,348 --> 00:37:03,649
So this is just another tax
break to get your books right.

797
00:37:03,651 --> 00:37:07,853
No. I decided that Morell Corp.
will end its year in the red.

798
00:37:07,855 --> 00:37:10,355
Some things are more
important than finances.

799
00:37:11,258 --> 00:37:12,491
Few things.

800
00:37:12,493 --> 00:37:15,093
But you were always there for me.

801
00:37:15,095 --> 00:37:16,795
Especially when my mom left.

802
00:37:16,797 --> 00:37:19,364
I just, I wish you could've
let me be there for you.

803
00:37:19,366 --> 00:37:21,366
Your mom traipsing off to
England is not the same thing

804
00:37:21,368 --> 00:37:23,569
as my dad getting arrested for drugs.

805
00:37:23,571 --> 00:37:27,542
I was so embarrassed by the
cliché he turned me into.

806
00:37:27,577 --> 00:37:30,509
A scholarship kid with a dad in prison.

807
00:37:30,511 --> 00:37:32,611
I never even went to go visit him.

808
00:37:32,613 --> 00:37:35,213
And he was so hurt by it
that he never forgave me.

809
00:37:35,215 --> 00:37:37,916
I mean, I was just a kid.

810
00:37:37,918 --> 00:37:41,153
But he said, "We all reap what we sow."

811
00:37:41,474 --> 00:37:42,788
But I mean, hey,

812
00:37:42,790 --> 00:37:46,224
at least my friends didn't
see me as less than.

813
00:37:46,226 --> 00:37:48,527
Or as their own personal charity case.

814
00:37:48,529 --> 00:37:50,495
But, Monica,
I've never seen you that way.

815
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,066
Fallon, I'm not just here

816
00:37:54,068 --> 00:37:55,801
to make you feel good about yourself.

817
00:37:55,803 --> 00:37:57,369
Jeff can do that.

818
00:37:57,371 --> 00:38:00,005
And if you really cared
about our friendship,

819
00:38:00,007 --> 00:38:02,329
you'd stop using him to replace Culhane.

820
00:38:02,376 --> 00:38:04,476
But I'm not.

821
00:38:04,478 --> 00:38:07,346
I mean, Jeff did literally
tell me I could use him...

822
00:38:07,348 --> 00:38:09,147
Well, then, that's on you, Fallon.

823
00:38:09,149 --> 00:38:11,183
But we all reap what we sow.

824
00:38:14,930 --> 00:38:16,088
Hey, Bobbi?

825
00:38:16,090 --> 00:38:18,132
Oh, sorry, Chief of Police.

826
00:38:18,659 --> 00:38:20,692
I'll never get used to calling you that.

827
00:38:20,694 --> 00:38:23,929
Can't believe how far
my cousin's come up.

828
00:38:23,931 --> 00:38:25,564
Yeah, I just wanted to thank you

829
00:38:25,566 --> 00:38:27,733
for helping me with
that Ted Dinard thing.

830
00:38:27,735 --> 00:38:29,401
I owe you.

831
00:38:31,672 --> 00:38:32,971
He's ready for you.

832
00:38:34,579 --> 00:38:36,942
What the hell was that all about?

833
00:38:36,944 --> 00:38:39,011
- I didn't know she would...
- _

834
00:38:39,013 --> 00:38:40,445
Fallon Carrington?

835
00:38:40,447 --> 00:38:42,080
I shouldn't have told her, all right?

836
00:38:42,082 --> 00:38:44,028
I had no idea she would come and visit.

837
00:38:44,085 --> 00:38:46,952
And here I was thinking you were
the smart one in the family.

838
00:38:46,953 --> 00:38:48,153
_

839
00:38:48,188 --> 00:38:51,923
- It's not what it looks like, Dad.
- No, it's not.

840
00:38:51,925 --> 00:38:53,959
You're in one hell of a mess.

841
00:38:54,634 --> 00:38:56,128
And it's my fault.

842
00:38:58,399 --> 00:39:00,632
What, you...
think I'm here on drug charges?

843
00:39:00,634 --> 00:39:03,468
You think I'm that much of a stereotype?

844
00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:05,904
Mm-hmm, yeah, sure looks like one.

845
00:39:05,906 --> 00:39:07,272
But try being a black man in Georgia

846
00:39:07,274 --> 00:39:08,774
with no legal representation,

847
00:39:08,776 --> 00:39:10,509
forced to appear in front of a judge

848
00:39:10,511 --> 00:39:13,145
and explain how a brick of blow
got into the trunk of my car.

849
00:39:13,147 --> 00:39:15,080
A judge whose country club membership

850
00:39:15,082 --> 00:39:17,115
is paid for by the Carringtons.

851
00:39:17,117 --> 00:39:18,817
Mm.

852
00:39:18,819 --> 00:39:20,752
Yeah, they wanted me gone.

853
00:39:20,754 --> 00:39:22,554
Quietly.

854
00:39:22,556 --> 00:39:24,790
So it wouldn't come out that
I was trying to kill the man

855
00:39:24,792 --> 00:39:27,192
that was screwing your mother.

856
00:39:28,495 --> 00:39:30,495
Blake Carrington.

857
00:39:32,099 --> 00:39:34,332
Think I don't know that?

858
00:39:34,334 --> 00:39:36,101
Wish it hadn't taken so long

859
00:39:36,103 --> 00:39:40,272
for you to tell me yourself,
but I figured it out.

860
00:39:41,483 --> 00:39:45,343
Why do you think I'm getting
so close to his family?

861
00:39:45,345 --> 00:39:47,546
Hmm?

862
00:39:47,547 --> 00:39:52,421
_

863
00:40:04,031 --> 00:40:05,497
Monica?

864
00:40:05,499 --> 00:40:06,898
Can I come in?

865
00:40:14,007 --> 00:40:15,707
You think you know a person.

866
00:40:15,709 --> 00:40:16,908
And then...

867
00:40:17,276 --> 00:40:19,231
This is the crappiest mix

868
00:40:19,266 --> 00:40:20,886
anyone has ever made me.

869
00:40:21,296 --> 00:40:23,048
I didn't choose the songs.

870
00:40:23,050 --> 00:40:26,852
Some teacher/DJ did at
the Penley winter dance.

871
00:40:26,854 --> 00:40:28,286
Oh, my God.

872
00:40:28,288 --> 00:40:30,722
2007. The night you stood me up.

873
00:40:30,724 --> 00:40:33,024
We all make mistakes.

874
00:40:33,026 --> 00:40:36,795
Well, at least this is one we can fix.

875
00:40:36,797 --> 00:40:38,597
But I can't do this anymore.

876
00:40:38,599 --> 00:40:41,633
I don't want to use you anymore.

877
00:40:43,070 --> 00:40:45,904
I want this to be real.

878
00:41:04,158 --> 00:41:05,891
What are you doing?

879
00:41:05,893 --> 00:41:07,959
Making my own choices.

880
00:41:07,961 --> 00:41:09,795
How about you?

881
00:41:24,511 --> 00:41:25,911
Diego Calastana.

882
00:41:25,913 --> 00:41:28,079
I am sorry to keep you waiting.

883
00:41:28,081 --> 00:41:29,848
Blake Carrington.

884
00:41:29,850 --> 00:41:32,150
What a pleasure it is to meet you.

885
00:41:34,625 --> 00:41:36,521
Been looking forward to
this for quite some time.

886
