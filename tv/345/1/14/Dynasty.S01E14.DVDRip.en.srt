Sorry. You can't go in there.

This is Mrs. Carrington

Where's Blake?
He's in the library.

5

[ Chattering ]
Krystle.

6
00:01:47,698 --> 00:01:49,791
Thank God you're back.

7
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:52,061
Look, it's none of my business why you left.

8
00:01:52,169 --> 00:01:54,137
You made the right decisionyou're back.

9
00:01:54,238 --> 00:01:57,298
When I left this morning,
I wasn't coming back.

10
00:01:57,408 --> 00:01:59,808
Now, don't tell Blake that.

11
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:02,071
He already knows.

12
00:02:02,179 --> 00:02:04,374
Yeah, well, he doesn't believe it.

13
00:02:05,983 --> 00:02:10,420
Be careful what you say and do, please.

14
00:02:10,521 --> 00:02:12,512
Come on.

15
00:02:42,219 --> 00:02:46,246
Just give me a moment.
No! No!

16
00:02:46,357 --> 00:02:49,087
<i>Mr. Carrington,you know the law.</i>

17
00:02:49,193 --> 00:02:51,661
If you don't, this is the law.
We've got to take you to headquarters.

18
00:02:51,762 --> 00:02:54,162
I told you that it was an accident.
I've told you that!

19
00:02:54,265 --> 00:02:56,233
Andrew, will you tell them?
I'm not going anywhere.

20
00:02:56,333 --> 00:02:58,267
You tell them that
the whole thing was a mistake.

21
00:02:58,369 --> 00:03:00,269
It was an argument an accident.

22
00:03:00,371 --> 00:03:02,635
I've tried to explain that
to them. Haven't I?

23
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:05,038
It's not our place to decide that.

24
00:03:05,142 --> 00:03:08,873
Blake, listen to me carefully.

25
00:03:08,979 --> 00:03:12,938
<i>This is very serious.
Ted Dinard is dead.</i>

26
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:14,984
You have to go with them.

27
00:03:20,524 --> 00:03:22,424
Have you heard from Krystle?

28
00:03:22,526 --> 00:03:26,895
I'm not I'm not going anywhere
till I hear from her.

29
00:03:26,997 --> 00:03:31,058
She's here, Blake. She's here.

30
00:03:31,168 --> 00:03:33,898
Fellas, uh, can you give him
a couple of minutes?

31
00:04:13,444 --> 00:04:15,344
Thank you.

32
00:04:36,233 --> 00:04:38,497
<i>Mr. Carrington?</i>

33
00:04:38,602 --> 00:04:41,765
I'm sorry, Mr. Carrington,
but I have to do this.

34
00:04:41,872 --> 00:04:44,340
Wait a minute! What are you doing?
You can't put those on him.

35
00:04:44,441 --> 00:04:46,341
It's all right.
They're just doing their job.

36
00:04:46,443 --> 00:04:48,934
They've got to take me downtown.
Oh.

37
00:05:05,829 --> 00:05:08,525
<i>- There he is.!
- Come on. Back up. Give him room.</i>

38
00:05:34,824 --> 00:05:37,953
They're gonna
go for first degree murder one.

39
00:05:39,263 --> 00:05:42,721
What?
The word is already out.

40
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:45,563
The D.A.'s gonna push on this one
and push hard.

41
00:05:45,669 --> 00:05:48,729
What are you talking about?
There was no weapon. There was nothing.

42
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:50,739
It It was an accident.

43
00:05:50,841 --> 00:05:52,968
They're gonna go for it, Blake.

44
00:05:53,077 --> 00:05:55,272
One of your servants told the police...

45
00:05:55,379 --> 00:05:57,574
that they heard you
threaten Dinard's life...

46
00:05:57,681 --> 00:05:59,740
just before you went up the stairs.

47
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:03,479
That's premeditation. Now, legally,
it can be a year of plotting...

48
00:06:03,587 --> 00:06:05,487
a minute, a half a minute.

49
00:06:05,589 --> 00:06:09,081
But there was no... premeditation.

50
00:06:09,193 --> 00:06:11,388
This would normally
be a manslaughter charge...

51
00:06:11,495 --> 00:06:14,862
and you'd probably get probation,
but I can tell you this, Blake

52
00:06:14,965 --> 00:06:17,661
that's not the way it's gonna be,
not on this one.

53
00:06:17,768 --> 00:06:20,430
<i>All right.</i>

54
00:06:20,537 --> 00:06:23,301
You get on the phone
and do what you have to do.

55
00:06:23,407 --> 00:06:26,137
Now, we've helped put
a lot of politicians into office.

56
00:06:26,243 --> 00:06:29,679
Call in those I.O.U.'s.
Call in some of those markers, Andrew.

57
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:34,080
<i>You get this thing taken care of,
and you do it right now.</i>

58
00:06:34,184 --> 00:06:36,778
Blake. Blake, you don't understand.

59
00:06:36,887 --> 00:06:40,516
I don't need to understand.
ThatThat's what I've got you for.

60
00:06:40,624 --> 00:06:42,524
Now you go ahead and handle it.

61
00:06:42,626 --> 00:06:46,824
Krystle, uh, why don't you go home
and try to get some rest?

62
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:49,091
This is liable to turn
into a long night for him.

63
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,099
We still have to get the bail set.

64
00:06:51,201 --> 00:06:54,432
No. I want to stay.

65
00:06:56,974 --> 00:07:00,466
Blake, I'm gonna
spell it out for you, okay?

66
00:07:01,812 --> 00:07:04,110
<i>You stepped on a lot of political toes.</i>

67
00:07:04,214 --> 00:07:07,809
You supported a lot of the wrong people
in political campaigns.

68
00:07:07,918 --> 00:07:09,818
You passed out a hell of a lot of money...

69
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:12,855
to causes resented by
a hell of a lot of people.

70
00:07:12,956 --> 00:07:15,789
<i>They've been sitting around
just waiting for a chance like this</i>

71
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:18,828
to watch Blake Carrington go under.

72
00:07:18,929 --> 00:07:21,557
What about my friends?
You said it yourself

73
00:07:21,665 --> 00:07:23,656
""The only friend is a dead enemy.''

74
00:07:23,767 --> 00:07:26,565
And to put it bluntly, a lot of
people would like to see you dead...

75
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:28,570
or at least locked up.

76
00:07:30,174 --> 00:07:33,871
Yes, but we still have... friends.

77
00:07:37,281 --> 00:07:39,306
This is gonna get very messy.

78
00:07:39,416 --> 00:07:42,385
Krystle, I really think you should go.

79
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:48,990
Do it, please.

80
00:08:10,113 --> 00:08:12,013

82

use your head.

83

Hey, hey.

85
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:30,625
Are you gonna listen to me?
What?

86
00:08:32,536 --> 00:08:34,731
I want you to listen to me.

87
00:08:34,838 --> 00:08:39,036
Krystle, now, you know this trial
is going to be very, very hard.

88
00:08:39,142 --> 00:08:42,009
You know that, don't you?
Yes.

89
00:08:42,112 --> 00:08:44,410
Then run from it, Krystle,
the way you started to.

90
00:08:44,514 --> 00:08:46,709
Run from the both of us Blake and me.

91
00:08:48,318 --> 00:08:51,378
Maybe I shouldn't say this, but...

92
00:08:51,488 --> 00:08:53,888
you finally had the courage
to do the right thing, Krystle.

93
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:57,017
Now, damn it, do it.

94

No.

96

00:13:10,614 --> 00:13:13,777
Thank you.
I'm really gonna enjoy this.

142
00:13:13,884 --> 00:13:17,752
Kinda reminds me of my football days
first time I ever made the varsity.

143
00:13:17,854 --> 00:13:20,687
I finally get to play with the big boys.

144
00:13:28,932 --> 00:13:30,900
One of our investigators
told me last night...

145
00:13:31,001 --> 00:13:34,767
that Dunham and Matthew Blaisdel
went to college together.

146
00:13:34,871 --> 00:13:38,307
Yeah. They played football.
Matter of fact, Dunham was very good.

upped the salary offer.

over my dead body.

00:14:07,637 --> 00:14:11,698
I know you asked me not to include her, but
I told you not to.

156
00:14:13,243 --> 00:14:16,610
Blake, we cannot start this trial
with you tying my hands.

157
00:14:16,713 --> 00:14:18,613
I don't understand you.

158
00:14:18,715 --> 00:14:22,276
You're willing to have me try to buy off
practically anyone, outside of the White House...

159
00:14:22,385 --> 00:14:24,285
and this is where you draw the line.

160
00:14:24,387 --> 00:14:26,287
Why?
It's just the way I feel.

161
00:14:26,389 --> 00:14:30,450
You do this one thing for me,
and I promise I will not interfere again.

162
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,461
You're making a big mistake.
She and Steven

163
00:14:33,563 --> 00:14:36,999
Had an affair. I know that.
But, no, not this woman.

164
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:39,568
She's already been through one hell.

165
00:14:41,238 --> 00:14:43,138
Okay, for now.

166
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:46,107
But there are no guarantees.
I may need her.

167
00:14:46,209 --> 00:14:48,177
<i>[ Bailiff]

175
00:15:22,212 --> 00:15:25,045
What's going on in there, Steven?

176
00:15:25,148 --> 00:15:28,481
They're selecting a jury of his peers.

177
00:15:28,585 --> 00:15:31,349
Oh, that's a joke. Who are they
to judge Blake Carrington?

178
00:15:31,454 --> 00:15:33,547
What about Ted?

179
00:15:33,657 --> 00:15:35,557
Are they his peers, Fallon?

180
00:15:47,537 --> 00:15:49,937
<i>[ Dunham ] Let me put it this way,
ladies and gentlemen.</i>

181
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:54,568
<i>Ajury trial is Well, it's a little bit
like a giantjigsaw puzzle.</i>

182
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:59,537
The evidence comes in
one piece at a time.

183
00:15:59,649 --> 00:16:02,243
While each individual piece
when you look at it closely

184
00:16:02,352 --> 00:16:04,912
doesn't seem to make
very much sense...

185
00:16:05,021 --> 00:16:08,479
when you put it all together, and you step back,
and you look at the big picture...

186
00:16:10,126 --> 00:16:12,720
<i>it all becomes very clear.</i>

187
00:16:14,364 --> 00:16:18,323
What I'd like to do right now
is to just give you a basic idea...

188
00:16:18,435 --> 00:16:23,134
of what the individual pieces of this
particular puzzle are gonna look like.

189
00:16:25,075 --> 00:16:28,511
Now, the judge has told you that...

190
00:16:28,611 --> 00:16:31,341
Mr. Blake Carrington,
seated at that table over there

191
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:34,906
<i>[ Clears Throat ]
has been charged with murder.</i>

192
00:16:35,018 --> 00:16:38,818
The prosecution will show that,
on the night of November 1 2...

193
00:16:38,922 --> 00:16:42,085
the victim of that murder Mr. Ted Dinard

194
00:16:42,192 --> 00:16:45,889
was in the Carrington house,
upstairs in Steven Carrington's room.

195
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:49,197
The prosecution will also show...

196
00:16:50,967 --> 00:16:53,629
that the victim, Mr. Dinard...

197
00:16:53,737 --> 00:16:58,606
and Steven Carrington,
the defendant's son...

198
00:16:58,708 --> 00:17:02,940
<i>had been lovers...
for a considerable period of time.</i>

199
00:17:03,046 --> 00:17:05,674
We will also show
that Mr. Blake Carrington...

200
00:17:05,782 --> 00:17:08,546
knew about this
homosexual relationship...

201
00:17:08,651 --> 00:17:11,814
that existed between his son
and Mr. Dinard...

202
00:17:13,289 --> 00:17:17,419
and, because of that relationship,
he hated the victim...

203
00:17:18,862 --> 00:17:21,854
<i>with a cold and unrelenting hatred.</i>

204
00:17:21,965 --> 00:17:24,525
<i>And on that particular night...</i>

205
00:17:24,634 --> 00:17:27,660
when Mr. Carrington
arrived at the house...

206
00:17:27,771 --> 00:17:32,265
and when he learned that the two young men
were alone upstairs together...

207
00:17:34,077 --> 00:17:36,637
<i>in a cold rage...</i>

208
00:17:36,746 --> 00:17:40,773
he issued a threat
a most violent threat

209
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,620
<i>in the presence of a witness.</i>

210
00:17:45,722 --> 00:17:51,354
And at that very moment,
Mr. Blake Carrington formed the intent

211
00:17:51,461 --> 00:17:56,660
<i>the premeditated intent
to take the life of Ted Dinard.</i>

212
00:17:58,468 --> 00:18:03,701
And a very few moments later,
the defendant burst into his son's room...

213
00:18:03,807 --> 00:18:06,605
<i>and, in his hatred for Ted Dinard...</i>

214
00:18:06,709 --> 00:18:09,610
delivered a powerful blow
with all of his strength...

215
00:18:09,712 --> 00:18:13,978
against the unresisting victim,
causing his death

216
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:18,179
<i>a death he intended to cause.</i>

217
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:24,724
This is what the prosecution
intends to prove, ladies and gentlemen.

218
00:18:26,529 --> 00:18:28,861
<i>And this is what we will prove.</i>

219
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,891
Now...

220
00:18:33,002 --> 00:18:35,061
during the selection process...

221
00:18:35,171 --> 00:18:37,662
you were all asked several questions...

222
00:18:37,774 --> 00:18:42,234
about your personal attitudes
towards homosexuality.

223
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:46,346
I'd like to remind you...

224
00:18:46,449 --> 00:18:49,213
<i>we all of us have a right to our lives,
ladies and gentlemen...</i>

225
00:18:49,319 --> 00:18:52,948
regardless of our sexual orientation.

226
00:18:56,426 --> 00:18:58,621
But be prepared.

227
00:19:01,164 --> 00:19:03,724
Be prepared for the defense
attorney, however...

228
00:19:05,401 --> 00:19:08,632
who may try to create a diversion here...

229
00:19:08,738 --> 00:19:11,263
a smoke screen, if you will.

230
00:19:11,374 --> 00:19:13,706
He may try to confuse you
into thinking somehow...

231
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:16,278
that the dead young man, Mr. Dinard...

232
00:19:16,379 --> 00:19:18,870
was the criminal in this case...

233
00:19:18,982 --> 00:19:23,385
<i>and not the defendant,
Mr. Blake Carrington there
[ Quinlan ] Counsel?</i>

234
00:19:23,486 --> 00:19:26,751
Let me remind you
that the opening statement...

235
00:19:26,856 --> 00:19:29,825
is an outline of the evidence
you're going to present.

236
00:19:29,926 --> 00:19:32,121
It is not a closing argument.

237
00:19:33,229 --> 00:19:35,129
Very well, Your Honor.

238
00:19:35,231 --> 00:19:39,531
In that case, I have
nothing more to say... for now.

239
00:19:42,505 --> 00:19:44,405
Thank you.

240
00:20:04,193 --> 00:20:06,320
<i>[ Quinlan ]
Mr. Laird.</i>

241
00:20:09,332 --> 00:20:11,960
As you know, ladies and gentlemen...

242
00:20:12,068 --> 00:20:15,663
the district attorney's office
gets to present its case first...

243
00:20:15,772 --> 00:20:18,400
and then the defense presents.

244
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:22,000
And so we hope that you
will withhold judgment in your minds...

245
00:20:22,111 --> 00:20:25,706
until you hear both sides

246
00:20:25,815 --> 00:20:27,840
both sides.

247
00:20:27,951 --> 00:20:30,181
Now, what we will try to prove to you...

248
00:20:30,286 --> 00:20:33,847
is that the death ofTed Dinard...

249
00:20:33,957 --> 00:20:37,188
was an accident an accident.

250
00:20:37,293 --> 00:20:40,353
Yes, it is true that
Blake Carrington was present...

251
00:20:40,463 --> 00:20:43,023
<i>when that unfortunate death took place...</i>

252
00:20:43,132 --> 00:20:46,966
but that death was not
intentionally precipitated...

253
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:51,302
by any action on the part
of Blake Carrington.

254
00:20:52,909 --> 00:20:55,639
His intent and his only intent

255
00:20:55,745 --> 00:20:59,010
<i>was to protect his young son.</i>

256
00:20:59,115 --> 00:21:02,846
Now, as this case develops...

257
00:21:02,952 --> 00:21:05,079
we are going to see
that Blake Carrington...

258
00:21:05,188 --> 00:21:08,055
had a strong and lifelong love...

259
00:21:08,191 --> 00:21:10,216
<i>for his young son.</i>

260
00:21:10,326 --> 00:21:13,887
Oh, he knew that he had gone awry...

261
00:21:13,997 --> 00:21:16,227
<i>but he also knew at the same time...</i>

262
00:21:16,332 --> 00:21:22,032
<i>that he was well on the road
to a normal and manly life.</i>

263
00:21:23,406 --> 00:21:26,933
Now, on the evening
of the unfortunate accident...

264
00:21:27,043 --> 00:21:29,204
Blake Carrington entered his home...

265
00:21:29,312 --> 00:21:33,681
<i>and learned to his horror and disgust...</i>

266
00:21:33,783 --> 00:21:37,048
that Ted Dinard was present in his home.

267
00:21:38,254 --> 00:21:41,155
Thinking of his son,
and thinking only

268
00:21:41,257 --> 00:21:46,695
<i>only to protect and save him
from a life of shame...</i>

269
00:21:46,796 --> 00:21:49,993
<i>the defendant went upstairs
to see his son, to talk to him...</i>

270
00:21:50,099 --> 00:21:52,966
and there found Ted Dinard...

271
00:21:53,069 --> 00:21:56,197
with his arms around his son.

272
00:21:57,507 --> 00:22:00,067
Mr. Carrington stepped into the room...

273
00:22:00,176 --> 00:22:03,543
<i>and commanded Ted Dinard to leave.</i>

274
00:22:03,646 --> 00:22:05,944
At that point, ladies and gentlemen...

275
00:22:06,049 --> 00:22:08,745
as the evidence is going to show you

276
00:22:08,851 --> 00:22:11,445
and I'm sure you'll be convinced
at the end of this trial

277
00:22:11,554 --> 00:22:14,751
that the tragic death ofTed Dinard
which then occurred...

278
00:22:16,292 --> 00:22:19,284
was an accident an accident

279
00:22:19,395 --> 00:22:21,727
<i>which Blake Carrington did not</i>

280
00:22:21,831 --> 00:22:25,460
did not intentionally bring about.

00:22:28,271 --> 00:22:30,171
Thank you.

282
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:03,605
Steven, I know
you're just sitting there.

283
00:23:03,706 --> 00:23:06,675
<i>Damn. Answer me.
[Jeff] He's all right.</i>

284
00:23:08,711 --> 00:23:11,179
Don't try to pacify me,Jeff.

285
00:23:16,686 --> 00:23:18,950
Well, I'm part of the family.

286
00:23:19,055 --> 00:23:22,354
Seems to me you made it pretty clear
what you think of my father.

287
00:23:22,458 --> 00:23:24,858
You don't like him,
and you never did like him.

288
00:23:25,061 --> 00:23:29,188
<i>If you ask me,you'd be as happy as a lot
of other people to see him go under.</i>

289
00:23:37,973 --> 00:23:40,965
Steven, answer me.

290
00:24:06,302 --> 00:24:10,261
Well, Mrs. Gunnerson
will be disappointed.

291
00:24:10,373 --> 00:24:14,332
None of us are eating
very much again tonight.

292
00:24:20,716 --> 00:24:24,152
Oh, Fallon, have you
spoken to your brother?

293
00:24:25,855 --> 00:24:28,153
Yes. I talked to him a little while ago
on the telephone.

294
00:24:28,257 --> 00:24:31,249
How is he? Is he all right?

295
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:34,727
Yeah, he sounded all right.

296
00:24:38,935 --> 00:24:41,768
I called him a couple of times.
No answer.

297
00:24:44,307 --> 00:24:48,266
Blake, I don't know if
this is the time or place...

298
00:24:48,377 --> 00:24:52,404
but I've been wanting to talk to you
about something that's on my mind.

299
00:24:52,515 --> 00:24:55,678
It's probably a good a time as any.

300
00:24:55,785 --> 00:25:00,085
Now, you and I, we haven't been
getting along all that well recently.

301
00:25:00,189 --> 00:25:02,885
I've said some things to you
that were a little rough.

302
00:25:02,992 --> 00:25:08,294
[ Chuckles ] Father. Soninlaw.
It's a classic situation.

303
00:25:08,397 --> 00:25:11,025
Forget it. What is it you wanna
talk to me about?

304
00:25:11,133 --> 00:25:16,628
Well, I was at the office today, and, uh, I heard
some things that made me a little nervous.

305
00:25:16,739 --> 00:25:19,799
<i>About your business.</i>

306
00:25:19,909 --> 00:25:23,936
There's that board meeting on Friday.
Yes. What about it?

307
00:25:24,046 --> 00:25:28,745
Well, there'll be a decision made on that
bank loan, Mitsukawa in Honolulu.

308
00:25:28,851 --> 00:25:30,751
And you're not going to be there...

309
00:25:30,853 --> 00:25:34,653
and a few of your directors are going to take
advantage of ityou're not being there.

310
00:25:34,757 --> 00:25:39,888
Blake owns 7 0% of Denver Carrington
stock. How can they take advantage?

311
00:25:39,996 --> 00:25:44,330
Well, they can. That is, unless
I'm not there to stop them.

312
00:25:48,871 --> 00:25:52,830
But I've arranged with Andy Laird to set that
board meeting for Friday morning.

313
00:25:52,942 --> 00:25:57,003
You see, the judge is going to recess.
He's got a doctor's appointment.

314
00:25:58,547 --> 00:26:00,777
<i>I thank you anyway.</i>

315
00:26:00,883 --> 00:26:06,446
And I'll be there, and I'll stop them.
You can be sure of that.

316
00:26:23,506 --> 00:26:26,236
Give me a moment.

317
00:26:32,949 --> 00:26:35,713
Hello, Steven.

318
00:26:38,487 --> 00:26:41,149
Can we talk?

319
00:26:43,592 --> 00:26:45,116
Steven, look at me.

320
00:26:48,664 --> 00:26:50,791
I can't.

321
00:27:09,852 --> 00:27:12,480
Miss Robbins...

322
00:27:12,588 --> 00:27:15,056
would you tell us, please,
what your occupation is...

323
00:27:15,157 --> 00:27:18,615
and by whom
you are presently employed?

324
00:27:18,728 --> 00:27:22,596
I'm a downstairs maid.
I work for Mr. Carrington

325
00:27:22,732 --> 00:27:27,328
<i>Mr. Blake Carringtonand I have for
the last 1 2 years.</i>

<i>I see. Now, on the night
of November 1 2...</i>

327
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:34,798
were you present in the Carrington house,
and if you were, where were you?

328
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:37,208
What were you doing?

329
00:27:37,313 --> 00:27:40,942
I was in the downstairs vestibule,
just off the main hall.

330
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:45,350
I was talking with Joseph.
He's our majordomo.

331
00:27:46,589 --> 00:27:49,717
Uh, don't you mean butler,
Miss Robbins?

332
00:27:49,825 --> 00:27:55,286
<i>No. There is a butler, Gerald.
Joseph is the majordomo.</i>

333
00:27:56,999 --> 00:27:59,968
[ Scoffs ]
Well, that's very interesting.

334
00:28:00,069 --> 00:28:03,971
II didn't realize that people
American people

335
00:28:04,073 --> 00:28:06,871
had majordomos anymore.

336
00:28:06,976 --> 00:28:10,275
As a matter of fact, I'm an American.
I don't even know what a majordomo is.

337
00:28:10,379 --> 00:28:13,075
What exactly is a majordomo, Miss Robbins?

338
00:28:13,182 --> 00:28:18,643
<i>Um, he's the head, uh, administrative head
of the household.</i>

339
00:28:18,754 --> 00:28:23,214
Uh, chief retainer.
Well, that's a very precise
definition, Miss Robbins.

340
00:28:23,325 --> 00:28:27,455
Did you look that up in a book once?
No. I got it from Joseph.

341
00:28:27,563 --> 00:28:29,394
<i>[ Spectators Laughing ]</i>

342
00:28:29,498 --> 00:28:32,126
I'm sure you did.

343
00:28:32,234 --> 00:28:35,362
[ Clears Throat ] Miss Robbins,
it is your testimony then...

344
00:28:35,471 --> 00:28:38,269
that on the night in question,
at approximately 1 0:30...

345
00:28:38,374 --> 00:28:42,003
you were in the house when Mr. Carrington,
the defendant, arrived home.

346
00:28:42,111 --> 00:28:44,477
Is that true?
Yes, it is.

347
00:28:46,182 --> 00:28:49,481
What happened when he entered
the house, Miss Robbins?

348
00:28:49,585 --> 00:28:54,284
Well, he asked who was home...

349
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:58,952
<i>and we told him Steven was home
with a friend ofhis.</i>

350
00:28:59,061 --> 00:29:01,689
With Mr. Dinard.

351
00:29:01,797 --> 00:29:07,258
What was Mr. Carrington's reaction
when you mentioned this?

352
00:29:07,369 --> 00:29:09,735
About Mr. Dinard, I mean.

353
00:29:11,273 --> 00:29:16,006
<i>Did he say anything?
Was he, uh, overjoyed?</i>

354
00:29:16,112 --> 00:29:19,445
<i>Was he angry, agitated?</i>

355
00:29:23,152 --> 00:29:27,213
I'd like to remind you, Miss Robbins that you
are testifying in this court under sworn oath.

356
00:29:30,426 --> 00:29:32,553
Yes, he was angry.

357
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:38,129
And, yes, he said something.

358
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:40,862
He said, ""I'll kill him.''

359
00:29:40,970 --> 00:29:44,838
<i>II'm sorry, Miss Robbins, would you repeat
your answer so the courtroom can hear it?</i>

360
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:48,740
<i>Now what did Mr. Carrington say?</i>

361
00:29:48,844 --> 00:29:51,472
<i>[ Quinlan ]
The witness will please speak up.</i>

362
00:29:55,184 --> 00:29:58,551
He said, ""I'll kill him.''

363
00:29:58,654 --> 00:30:02,613
Mr. Carrington said,
referring to the deceased, ""I'll kill him.''

364
00:30:02,725 --> 00:30:06,752
<i>[ Spectators Murmuring ]
""I'll kill him. '"</i>

365
00:30:13,969 --> 00:30:16,437
[ Exhales ] Well, what did he do then,
Miss Robbins?

366
00:30:18,474 --> 00:30:23,070
Um, he, uh, ran toward the stairs.

367
00:30:23,179 --> 00:30:27,843
Was he angry?
Was he very angry, Miss Robbins?

Yes.
Yes.

I went over to Meadsburg to have
a little supper with my wife, Nell.

You almost ready?
And we were sitting in the restaurant...

and, uh, there we saw them, there they were.

379
00:31:13,696 --> 00:31:16,494
They weren't ordering or anything.
There were sitting, looking at each other.

380
00:31:16,599 --> 00:31:19,898
Every once in a while, the one guy
would touch the other guy's face.

Leave it to Ed Cleves. He probably
volunteered as a damn witness.

389
00:31:49,865 --> 00:31:52,663
Why are they dragging up
all this stuff about Steven?

390
00:31:52,768 --> 00:31:58,229
Well [ Exhales ] WhatJake wants to prove
is that he was a homosexual...

391
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:02,640
and that Laird's line about him being seduced
and becoming a homosexual is all bull.

392
00:32:02,745 --> 00:32:06,875
He isn't.
Huh?

393
00:32:06,982 --> 00:32:10,110

One day.

I mean, one night. Remember the night
we had dinner at the Carringtons'?

00:32:28,771 --> 00:32:31,205
I went into the library, and he was there
and we talked.

399
00:32:39,581 --> 00:32:45,042
Seems like a hell of an odd thing for him
to bring up the first time you'd met.

Are you all right?
You look like you're upset.

about these lawyers.

into some kind of sporting event.

<i>We have a lot toto work out.</i>

Is it because you think
I purposely killed that boy?

00:34:09,171 --> 00:34:10,832
It was certainly not purposefully.

00:34:13,575 --> 00:34:17,511
Blake, I don't know what to think.

00:34:17,613 --> 00:34:21,413
All I know is is that the night I left you...

you were in a terrible state,
and for that I feel guilty.

Your board of directors,
they moved the meeting up.

00:35:16,672 --> 00:35:19,140
They did? To when?
This afternoon, 2:00.

00:35:19,241 --> 00:35:21,232
Damn.

428
00:35:23,612 --> 00:35:27,844
Blake, they're starting again.
We need you back in the courtroom.

429
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:29,918
They're moving in on me, Andrew.

430
00:35:30,018 --> 00:35:33,249
They've changed the time of that meeting to
this afternoon. They know I can't be there then.

431
00:35:33,355 --> 00:35:37,655
There's nothing we can do about that now.
We have to get back.

432
00:35:37,759 --> 00:35:40,728
Blake, are you coming?

433
00:35:40,829 --> 00:35:44,629
Fallon, you and Jeff get in there.

434
00:35:44,733 --> 00:35:47,167
You come with me.
Michael, close this door.

00:35:47,269 --> 00:35:49,169
Don't let anyone in, you understand?
Yes, sir.

436
00:35:53,375 --> 00:35:56,503
Andrew, I wanna call a stockholders' meeting.
When?

437
00:35:56,612 --> 00:36:00,571
Here, right now. I want Krystle to
represent me at that board meeting.

438
00:36:00,682 --> 00:36:03,150
I vote all my shares
in favor of that proposition.

439
00:36:03,252 --> 00:36:05,720
I want you to activate the papers
I asked you to draw up.

440
00:36:05,821 --> 00:36:09,120
Okay. I'll make arrangements for the delivery
to Krystle immediately.

441
00:36:09,224 --> 00:36:12,682
Then can we get back into the courtroom?
The judge is gonna come unglued.

442
00:36:12,794 --> 00:36:15,262
Yes. You get in there.
You get me five minutes.

443
00:36:15,364 --> 00:36:18,663
Tell him I'm not feeling well. Tell him anything.
Okay, but make it fast.

444
00:36:18,767 --> 00:36:20,735
Blake, I can't do that.
I can't go to that meeting.

445
00:36:20,836 --> 00:36:23,304
You've got to. The sharks are
beginning to circle.

446
00:36:23,405 --> 00:36:26,033
They think that I'm weak enough so that they
can slip in and chew me up...

447
00:36:26,141 --> 00:36:28,109
but you're going to stop them.
How?

448
00:36:28,210 --> 00:36:30,678
By figuring out who the ringleader is...

449
00:36:30,779 --> 00:36:33,247
then cutting him down before
he even knows what's happening.

450
00:36:33,348 --> 00:36:36,146
But I don't
No, no. No questions.Just listen. Listen carefully.

451
00:36:36,251 --> 00:36:38,719
I may not have another chance
to go over this.

452

Keep your eye on Moore.

00:36:41,557 --> 00:36:44,025
Now, if he calls for
a vote on the Maris issue...

454
00:36:44,126 --> 00:36:47,254
then you move to table it
for a feasibility study.

455
00:36:47,362 --> 00:36:49,227
That'll cut him off at the pass.

456
00:36:55,437 --> 00:36:57,337
Would you state your full name
for the court, please.

457
00:36:57,439 --> 00:36:59,634
Fallon Carrington Colby.

458
00:37:07,683 --> 00:37:09,810
Mrs. Colby...

459
00:37:11,853 --> 00:37:13,980
what do you do for a living?

460
00:37:14,089 --> 00:37:17,388
I don't work.
Are you a housewife? Do you keep house?

461
00:37:17,492 --> 00:37:19,756
Cooking, cleaning, laundry?
Things like that?

462
00:37:19,861 --> 00:37:25,493
I'm a wife. I'm also here as
a hostile witness for the prosecution.

463
00:37:25,601 --> 00:37:29,560
I believe that's the phrase?
Yes, that's the phrase.

464
00:37:29,671 --> 00:37:32,970
Mrs. Colby, on the night
Ted Dinard died...

465
00:37:33,075 --> 00:37:36,806
you were in the hallway outside Steven
Carrington's room, is that correct?
Yes.

466
00:37:36,912 --> 00:37:40,541
And the door to the room was open?
Yes, it was.

467
00:37:40,649 --> 00:37:45,712
Tell us exactly what you observed,
if anything, through that open door.

468
00:37:45,821 --> 00:37:51,555
There were three people in the room.
My father, my brother Steven and Ted Dinard.

469
00:37:54,262 --> 00:37:56,162
May I have People's five, please.

470
00:37:58,033 --> 00:38:01,730
Is this the man you saw with your father
and your brother, Mrs. Colby?

471
00:38:01,837 --> 00:38:05,136
Your Honor, I object to the introduction
of that photograph...

472
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:09,677
since its probative value is outweighed by
the danger of undue prejudice.

473
00:38:09,778 --> 00:38:15,410
Mr. Dunham, is there any reason why you've
introduced that photograph as evidence?

474
00:38:15,517 --> 00:38:20,477
Yes, Your Honor, there is. I contacted
Mr. Dinard's parents in North Dakota.

475
00:38:20,589 --> 00:38:24,548
I asked them for a live photo of
a living young man, their son.

476
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:28,619
They refused to send one
to me or to this court.

477
00:38:28,730 --> 00:38:30,857
I'm going to have to
overrule your objection, Mr. Laird.

478
00:38:33,635 --> 00:38:37,401
I'll repeat the question. Is this the man
you saw with your father and your brother?

479
00:38:37,506 --> 00:38:39,599
Yes.

480
00:38:39,708 --> 00:38:43,838
For the record, the witness identifies
the body ofTed Dinard.

481
00:38:43,945 --> 00:38:49,110
Now, what happened next
in Steven's room, Mrs. Colby?

482
00:38:51,153 --> 00:38:53,849
My father was very upset.

483
00:38:53,955 --> 00:38:56,719
Yes, your father was upset.
What happened then?

484
00:38:58,927 --> 00:39:03,227
He was ordering Mr. Dinard
out of the room. There was a scuffle...

485
00:39:03,331 --> 00:39:06,391
<i>and Mr. Dinard
began to push my father.</i>

486
00:39:10,972 --> 00:39:14,772
Wasn't it your father that
did the pushing, Mrs. Colby?

487
00:39:14,876 --> 00:39:18,778
No. Mr. Dinard pushed my father.

488
00:39:28,323 --> 00:39:32,282
Mrs. Colby, I have a copy
of the police incident report.

489
00:39:33,995 --> 00:39:36,623
Didn't you tell the police officer
who interviewed you that night...

490
00:39:36,732 --> 00:39:40,691
that your father pushed
or struck Ted Dinard?

491
00:39:40,802 --> 00:39:43,236
Things were happening very fast.
I don't know what I told the police.

492
00:39:43,338 --> 00:39:46,466
I see, but you remember it
all more clearly now, is that right?

493
00:39:46,575 --> 00:39:48,440
Please tell us what happened then, Mrs. Colby.

494
00:39:48,543 --> 00:39:53,571
Ted Dinard took a step back.
I don't know why he did, he just did.

495
00:39:53,682 --> 00:39:58,244
<i>You see, my brother was packing
and there were some boxes in the room.</i>

496
00:39:58,353 --> 00:40:03,655
<i>So when he took a step back he tripped over
one of the boxes, and he accidentally fell.</i>

497
00:40:03,759 --> 00:40:08,093
<i>He hit his head on the fender.
The fireplace fender.</i>

498
00:40:08,196 --> 00:40:11,996
Well, that's very mysterious, Mrs. Colby.

499
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:14,000
In your original report to the police...

500
00:40:14,102 --> 00:40:17,401
you didn't tell them that
Ted Dinard took a step back.

501
00:40:17,506 --> 00:40:19,974
You didn't tell them that
he tripped over a box.

502
00:40:20,075 --> 00:40:22,543
You didn't tell them that
he accidentally fell and hit his head.

503
00:40:22,644 --> 00:40:24,479
Isn't that true, Mrs. Colby?
I don't know.

504
00:40:24,514 --> 00:40:26,709
Isn't that true, Mrs. Colby?
I don't know.

505
00:40:29,050 --> 00:40:32,508
I have no further questions
for this witness.

506
00:40:52,073 --> 00:40:55,372
<i>All right, we have
two important issues to discuss here.</i>

507
00:40:55,477 --> 00:40:59,174
The Mitsukawa bank loan and the loan
with the Maris Company. Is that right?

508
00:40:59,281 --> 00:41:02,648
<i>Mr. Natale?</i>

509
00:41:02,751 --> 00:41:05,049
I feel that what you're
going to press for here...

510
00:41:05,153 --> 00:41:09,089
is a, uh, postponement of the Mitsukawa loan
the repaying of that loan.

511
00:41:09,191 --> 00:41:12,160
What I'm here for, Mr. Natale...

512
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:17,254
is to press for a postponement on any decision
until my husband can be present.

513
00:41:17,365 --> 00:41:22,359
<i>It's a postponement that could be...
dangerous. The postponement, that is.</i>

514
00:41:22,470 --> 00:41:24,768
Why, Mr. Wells?

515
00:41:24,873 --> 00:41:28,832
So you could precipitate a default
and then take the company yourself?

516
00:41:28,944 --> 00:41:33,745
What are you talking about?
Do you know what she's talking about?

517
00:41:33,849 --> 00:41:35,749
They do.

518
00:41:37,118 --> 00:41:39,746
I have a document here
signed by Blake Carrington...

519
00:41:39,855 --> 00:41:42,153
which gives me the power to remove you.

520
00:41:42,257 --> 00:41:44,452
I hereby exercise that power.

521
00:41:47,295 --> 00:41:51,732
<i>Don't think just because Blake Carrington
isn't here that I won't be keeping an eye on you.</i>

522
00:41:51,833 --> 00:41:54,267
Every one of you.

523
00:42:03,645 --> 00:42:07,103
<i>Mr. Carrington, let me remind you that
you are under oath...</i>

524
00:42:07,215 --> 00:42:12,448
<i>and obligated to answer Mr. Dunham's
questions fully and completely.</i>

525
00:42:14,923 --> 00:42:20,725
Mr. Carrington, would you please tell us
when and where you first met the deceased.

526
00:42:20,829 --> 00:42:25,289
I met Ted Dinard in New York City
about a year and a half ago.

527
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:29,200
And how did you meet?
We were at a party.

528
00:42:29,304 --> 00:42:33,104
What kind of party?
II don't understand the question.

529
00:42:33,208 --> 00:42:38,305
Well, was it a gay party?
Gay not as in happy but as in homosexual.

530
00:42:38,413 --> 00:42:41,678
<i>[ Laughter]
The intent of the question was not to amuse.</i>

531
00:42:41,783 --> 00:42:44,411
The intent was to get a direct answer
from the witness.

532
00:42:44,519 --> 00:42:47,818
<i>No, it was not a gay party
in either of those senses.</i>

533
00:42:47,923 --> 00:42:51,950
ItIt was after an art gallery opening,
and we both just happened to be there.

534
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:56,827
I see. You met and you became friends.
Is that true?

535
00:42:56,932 --> 00:42:59,366
Yes.

536
00:42:59,467 --> 00:43:03,096
Close friends who decided to
take an apartment together.

537
00:43:03,204 --> 00:43:06,503
Is that a fact, Mr. Carrington?
Yes. That's a fact.

538
00:43:06,608 --> 00:43:11,238
Mr. Carrington,
did you and Mr. Dinard...

539
00:43:12,746 --> 00:43:15,804
become lovers
in this apartment?

540
00:43:16,685 --> 00:43:19,813
Yes, we did.
You were lovers.

541
00:43:21,656 --> 00:43:23,988
For how long were you lovers?

542
00:43:24,092 --> 00:43:27,357
About a year.

543
00:43:27,462 --> 00:43:30,920
About a year.

544
00:43:31,032 --> 00:43:33,159
All right.

545
00:43:33,268 --> 00:43:38,900
Now, let's jump to the last night
you saw the deceased alive.

546
00:43:39,007 --> 00:43:43,467
He was in your room. Now, it's already been
established that your father...

547
00:43:43,578 --> 00:43:45,512
entered your room and found you
together embracing

548
00:43:45,613 --> 00:43:49,413
We were saying goodbye to each other. Ted
had decided to leave and go back to New York.

549
00:43:49,517 --> 00:43:52,645
Mr. Carrington, you will speak when
you are asked a direct question.

550
00:43:52,754 --> 00:43:55,314
Mr. Dunham has not as yet asked a question.

551
00:43:55,423 --> 00:43:59,655
As I was saying,
it's already been established...

552
00:43:59,761 --> 00:44:05,563
that the accusedyour father entered your
room and found you together embracing...

553
00:44:05,667 --> 00:44:09,467
and that he ordered the deceased,
Mr. Dinard, to leave the room.

554
00:44:09,571 --> 00:44:11,937
Is that true?

555
00:44:14,809 --> 00:44:19,075
What he said was
for Ted to let go of me.

556
00:44:20,682 --> 00:44:25,415
Was your father upset when
he told Mr. Dinard to let go of you?

557
00:44:26,788 --> 00:44:29,916
Yes. HHe was angry.
Yes?

558
00:44:30,025 --> 00:44:33,483
He was furious.
Now, Mr. Carrington...

559
00:44:33,595 --> 00:44:37,224
<i>would you tell us, please,
exactly what happened next?</i>

560
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:44,367
Well, then my father moved
He moved towards Ted.

561
00:44:44,472 --> 00:44:47,930
Wouldn't ""lunge'' be a more accurate word?
Did he lunge at him?

562
00:44:48,043 --> 00:44:53,640
He moved very quickly.
And your friend, the deceased,
did he see him coming?

563
00:44:53,748 --> 00:44:56,649
Yes.
Did he do anything?

564
00:44:56,751 --> 00:45:01,552
No.
You're saying then that he simply stood there...

565
00:45:01,656 --> 00:45:04,056
while your father moved
very quickly towards him?

566
00:45:05,427 --> 00:45:07,827
Uh, yes.

567
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:14,727
All right, Mr. Carrington,
tell us what happened next.

568
00:45:22,444 --> 00:45:25,413
<i>[ Shaky Breath ]</i>

569
00:45:27,615 --> 00:45:31,984
Uh, mymy father pushed him.

570
00:45:32,087 --> 00:45:35,022
<i>[ Spectators Murmuring ]</i>

571
00:45:37,926 --> 00:45:41,384
HeHe struck him.
He struck him, Mr. Carrington?

572
00:45:41,496 --> 00:45:43,794
Yes.
He struck him how, Mr. Carrington?

573
00:45:43,898 --> 00:45:46,196
Did he strike him hard?
Yes.

574
00:45:46,301 --> 00:45:49,759
And the deceased, Mr. Carrington...

575
00:45:49,871 --> 00:45:52,840
did he strike back at your father?

576
00:45:52,941 --> 00:45:55,239
Did he try to
protect himself in any way?

577
00:45:55,343 --> 00:45:59,643
Or did he simply stand there where he was,
with his arms at his side...

578
00:45:59,747 --> 00:46:01,647
while your father attacked him?

579
00:46:04,419 --> 00:46:06,353
Please answer the question, Mr. Carrington.

580
00:46:06,454 --> 00:46:11,585
No, no. HHHe didn't
raise his hands or his arms.

581
00:46:11,693 --> 00:46:15,629
HeHe just stood there,
and I tried to pull my I tried

582
00:46:15,730 --> 00:46:21,225
No, no. Please. Louder and clearer,
Mr. Carrington, so the jury can hear you. Please.

583
00:46:21,336 --> 00:46:23,964
Look, II've told you everything that
I can. Can I get out of here?

584
00:46:24,072 --> 00:46:28,372
No! You can't. Now repeat your answer
and louder this time for the jury.

585
00:46:28,476 --> 00:46:30,376
This is a court of law,
Mr. Carrington.

586
00:46:30,478 --> 00:46:32,946
You will do as the deputy
district attorney has asked you.

587
00:46:33,047 --> 00:46:35,015
Now, please answer the question again.

588
00:46:35,116 --> 00:46:37,812
He stood there, okay?

589
00:46:37,919 --> 00:46:42,720
But your sister, Mr. Carrington,
has testified that Mr. Dinard was the one...

590
00:46:42,824 --> 00:46:46,260
who pushed, who shoved, who lunged,
who attacked at your father.

591
00:46:46,361 --> 00:46:51,321
<i>Isn't that true? Isn't that what your sister
has told this court?</i>

592
00:46:58,540 --> 00:47:01,602
<i>My sister lied.</i>

593
00:47:12,754 --> 00:47:15,488
She... She lied.
