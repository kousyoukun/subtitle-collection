-Cecil tried to kill me.
-What?

00:00:19,394 --> 00:00:21,896
The man was crazy.

Blake Carrington sent my father to prison.

He's been pulling strings
to keep him there.

The commissioner overruled that decision.
Cecil Colby's being released.

-That's not what it looks like.

He ripped my earring out

He was trying to frame me for his murder.

Okay. Well, as screwed up as that is,
just tell the police what happened.

For some reason they believe me?
I'm still screwed.

I'm not here legally, Steven.
My papers are not valid anymore.

Really? Just get back to the manor

[Fallon] Okay, let's back it up.

Why on earth would Jeff want
to marry me so badly

34
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:00,411
that he'd have Monica manipulate me?

-Marriage is the ultimate merger.
-Carringtons don't marry without a prenup.

Maybe this is to spite your father.

37
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:10,547
When you wanted to leave,
Jeff was quick to back you.

00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:13,341
And smug every chance he got to rub it in.

39
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:17,345
As smug as you are now? You're loving
that you were right about Jeff.

I don't mind it.
I do mind you wearing his ring, though.

41
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:24,561
I had to make him believe
that I was into him, not onto him.

42
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:29,149
The closer I stay, better chance I have
of figuring out what the hell's going on.

43
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:33,444
I mean, what if he's been using me
this whole time?

44
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:34,487
And I let him.

45
00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:38,616
This is exactly why I don't trust people.
But he was always so...

46
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:43,663
Oh, my God.
-[Jeff] I trust you.

Even if you don't trust me.

48
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:48,376
Remember that program Jeff gave me

49
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:52,839
when we were trying to erase Cristal's
affair? Told me to run it on the server.

50
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:56,551
-And you said it worked.
-It did. But what if it gave him access?

51
00:02:56,968 --> 00:03:00,638
I always wondered how he knew so much
about the Venezuela deal.

52
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:04,851
I mean, what if he's been reading
all of our e-mails, all of our texts?

-Priests make me break out in hives.
-Is that true?

59
00:03:24,203 --> 00:03:27,957
It's bait.
And we're gonna see if Jeff takes it.

62

the way you described it.

63
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:46,768
But this is better
than anything I could've imagined.

64
00:03:46,851 --> 00:03:50,772
So, I set it to the property lines.
Rules are here if you forget them.

-But I wouldn't forget them.

You didn't give her the whole story?

No. Just the tip.

Kissing a married woman

-Something like:

"We shouldn't have done that, Rick,
but you know I'm impulsive.

-And I love that you're impulsive, too."
-I love my husband.

You love your freedom. You're afraid
you were wrong to give that up.

-He has quite the temper.
-Yeah. That was a misunderstanding.

129

Hates your dad for putting me through
that lawsuit and trying to take my tech.

130

Don't worry, I'll tell him
to use his inside voice this time.

00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:42,170
So, about Blake...

132
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:47,049
what did he say? Or did you not tell him
about our engagement?

133
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:49,510
We both know that isn't going to go well.

Too much, too soon.

137
00:07:56,851 --> 00:08:00,229
I can't see Fallon Carrington
getting married in a church.

138

Not without burning it down.

139
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:06,527
I mean, I'll do whatever you want.

No, I'm impressed.

141
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,699
You know me so well.

142
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:16,746
-What did you say?
-Nothing that wouldn't have made sense

143
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:20,750
if Ted had simply stuck to his plan
and died. I had to think quick.

144
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:24,587
I knew what Sam told me, that Ted
wanted it to look like Sam pushed him.

145
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:27,673
-Sam didn't push him?
-No. Sam didn't do anything.

146
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:31,719
Ted might have Sam's blood on him.
I couldn't find the earring.

147
00:08:31,802 --> 00:08:36,098
Plus, if Ted wakes up from the coma,
this is gonna look worse because I lied.

148
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:40,436
That can't happen. You have to get
into his room before anyone else does.

149
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:43,731
-Dad.
-To wipe off the blood. Not kill him.

00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:52,657
What are you doing?

153
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:58,663
Because you're a same-sex partner,
you're not considered family?

154
00:08:58,746 --> 00:09:01,791
Sir, keep your voice down,
or you'll be asked to leave.

155
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:06,587
What is this, 1952? My son can't comfort
a dying man, the love of his life,

156
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:08,673
because of his sexual orientation?

157
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:12,426
This is inexcusable, not to mention
disrespectful to all the gays,

158
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,512
-the LTBZ community!
-Close enough.

159
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:18,307
Sir, I didn't know he was
Mr. Dinard's partner. He didn't mention--

160
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:21,477
Or you weren't listening,
because he's gay.

161
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:25,231
Follow me.

162
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:27,650
And I'll waive visiting hours.

163
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:36,909
-He took the bait.
-So, he is spying on you? That's illegal, we go to the police.

164
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:43,416
-His cousin is chief of police.
-Start with your dad.

165
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:46,043
No. No, if anybody's gonna nail Jeff,
it'll be me.

166
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:50,256
Blake has resources. We don't know
what type of blackmail Jeff may have.

167
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:52,883
Think I don't know that?
This is all my fault.

168
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:56,304
My dad warned me not to get involved
with Jeff, and I didn't listen.

169
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:59,098
Instead, I helped his enemy
plant spyware in our house.

170
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:00,558
You didn't know.

171
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:04,061
That doesn't matter.
My dad once blamed me for losing a deal

172
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:07,231
because he got stuck in traffic
on the way back from my recital.

173
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:10,860
-He'll never respect me again.
-So, then we keep it between us.

174
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:14,071
We need to find out what Jeff knows.

175
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:16,657
Ironically,
the only IT genius I know is Jeff.

176
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:18,743
I may know someone who can help us out.

177
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:24,582
-The nurses cleaned him?
-To avoid any possible infections.

178
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:26,125
Said it's basic procedure.

179
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:28,836
-The earring?
-Somewhere in the alley, I assume.

180
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:32,214
There's no reason
for anyone to know it ever existed.

181
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:36,927
-[Blake] We need to find that earring.
-Mr. Carrington, tell us about Mr. Dinard.

182
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:40,056
-Partner's gonna make it?
-How do they know we're here?

183
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:41,265
These things leak. You leaked this.

184
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:44,602
[reporters clamoring]

185
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:48,731
Nurse Ratched turned
into Florence Nightingale

186
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:52,068
at you being a grieving partner.
She ate that story up.

187
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:55,738
You are a public figure
running for city council.

188
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:59,617
We garner public sympathy
and spin the story in our favor,

189
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:02,328
no one even thinks to ask about Sam.

190
00:11:02,411 --> 00:11:05,539
Except the whole world thinks
I'm dating Ted Dinard.

191
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:09,835
Well, that seems like a small price to pay
for your future. And Sam's.

192
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:13,047
Okay. Fine.

193
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:18,552
I would like to ask
for everyone's respect at this time.

194
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:21,472
My son is going through
a traumatic event, and--

195
00:11:21,555 --> 00:11:24,642
And I can only take a few questions
right now.

196
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:26,560
Do you plan on suspending your campaign?

197
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:30,898
My priority now is the health
and well-being of my partner, Ted Dinard.

198
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:33,484
So, you're suspending it
to be with your partner?

199
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:37,446
I can't answer that right now.
Not during such an emotional moment.

200
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,574
Politics should never come
before human compassion.

201

-[Cristal] Partner?
-[Sam] That's one way to put it.

203
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:57,299
Well, someone's developed a case
of post-traumatic stress eating disorder.

204
00:11:57,466 --> 00:12:01,262
Hard to have an appetite
when you might be dragged away in cuffs.

205

I wouldn't last a day in prison.

This face has "Make Me Your Bitch"
all over it.

207
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:10,813
Hey, Blake is handling it. All you need
to do is lay low and stay out of trouble.

208
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:14,775
Yeah, that's the problem, it always
finds me, ever since I moved here.

209
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:18,779
The robbery that almost killed Blake,
my parents kidnapping Fallon,

210
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:23,159
and now the tragic triangle with Ted.
Really, I'm the trouble, aren't I?

211
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:26,036
Well, you do come
with a 747's worth of baggage.

212
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,705
-[Cristal] Anders.
-What?

213
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:29,206
He asked.

214
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:34,128
You and I are the same, Sam.

215
00:12:34,211 --> 00:12:36,964
We left Venezuela
in search of something better,

216
00:12:37,047 --> 00:12:39,550
you with fake papers, me with stolen ones.

217
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:43,846
Worked our asses off in a country
where cards seem to be stacked against us.

218
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:45,347
You worked your ass off.

219
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:49,643
I took a sketchier path, paved
by the kindness I stole from strangers.

220
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:53,272
This isn't stealing. This is what people
who love each other do.

221
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:56,358
I don't want them to do it for me.
I don't deserve it.

222
00:12:57,359 --> 00:13:00,905
And I especially don't want
to be a strain on your marriage.

223
00:13:00,988 --> 00:13:05,034
Trust me, there are bigger strains
on my marriage than you.

He's all yours. How you feeling?

227
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:21,175
Well, I mean, you are pretending
to be lovers with a dying man

228
00:13:21,258 --> 00:13:25,679

It's not your typical Wednesday.

229

How's your Ted-inflicted wound?

230
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:29,183
Mm.

231
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:34,939
It's fine. Honestly, what hurts is that
my grandmother gave me that earring,

232
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:39,610
when I was leaving Venezuela. She said it
was a way for God to be looking after me.

233
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:44,198
Well, maybe losing it is God's way
of saying you don't need it anymore.

234
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:46,825
You've got me to protect you now.

-I'm sorry.
-Don't be.

Why did we stop seeing each other, anyway?

237
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:03,884
Because I slept with Ted.

We all make mistakes, I guess.
Doesn't mean we should stop trying.

Hey, spare no expense.
My dad deserves the best.

So does my son.

You know, I like this.
You know good quality.

If we're choosing for the wedding,
stick with navy. Blake prefers gray.

Navy, then. And I'll be the father
shackled by the ankle bracelet.

That'll be off soon.

next his company.

And did you? Did you dump her?

-Are you and Jeff--?
-God, no.

to tell Mom and Dad you're a chauffeur.

[Culhane] So, to erase
what Jeff has on your family,

294
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:41,852
we need to destroy his laptop, his phone,
and find the private server.

295
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:46,815
One step at a time. First, we need to know
where he keeps it. And in an unfortunate

00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:50,152
yet fortunate turn of events,
I'm having dinner at Jeff's.

To meet his father.
Monica invited me, too.

00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:01,538
Why are you here?

300
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:04,458
-Well, your butler asked me to wait.
-Hey, Rick.

301
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:08,170
Steven. Thank you for agreeing
to a follow-up interview,

302
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:12,174
especially during such a difficult time.
A human-interest story.

303
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:15,385
People wanna know more
about your partner. Or husband?

304
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:18,514
Ted wasn't able to make an honest man
out of Steven.

305
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:19,431
Not yet.

306
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:22,768
Maybe not ever. Terrible situation.

307
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:25,020
Blake Carrington.

308
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:26,980
Nice to shake the hand of the man

309
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:30,734
-smart enough to marry Cristal Flores.
-It's Carrington now.

310
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:34,446
Nice to meet the man who's done
so much for my son's campaign.

311
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:35,614
Your interview went over well.

312
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:39,701
When you're done, why don't you
join Cristal and me for dinner?

313
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:42,121
Steven will have to get back
to Ted's side.

314
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:45,124
That would be fantastic.

315
00:18:58,178 --> 00:18:59,096
Mr. Dinard.

316
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:01,890
Steven Carrington.

317
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:07,521
What the hell happened to my son?

318
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:17,614
I know this is a lot to take in,
but I cared about your son.

319
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:19,950
Cared? My son is still alive.

320
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:24,788
Only time he ever mentioned your name
was when he was defending you,

321
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:28,292
the person that drove him away from me.

322
00:19:29,084 --> 00:19:30,127
Away from the church.

323
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:32,462
And when he finally reached out again,

324
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:36,508
it was to tell me that it was you
that left him rotting in jail.

325
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:38,635
No, sir, I bailed him out. He--

326
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:42,598
Ted and I had our ups and downs,
like any other couple. But...

327
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:46,268
-we were trying to make it work.
-I've been through war.

328
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:49,646
Much tougher men have tried to lie to me.

329
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:51,398
I know what you're doing.

330
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,609
Taking my son's situation

331
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:58,155
and milking the public for sympathy
with your press conference. Listen to me.

332
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:01,033
God already knows your sins,

333
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:02,367
but as for me,

334
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:05,579
I will do everything in my power
to expose them,

335
00:20:05,662 --> 00:20:08,290
to the police and to the press.

336
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:10,667
Now get out of my son's room!

337
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:12,711
Mr. Dinard.

338
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:17,966
We have your son's belongings.

339
00:20:20,677 --> 00:20:21,511
Thank you.

340
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,435
He's been talking about meeting you
all day. He's very excited.

341
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:33,398
Well, I'm excited for our rematch. Think
I'll need protective headgear this time?

342
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:36,610
He'd been in prison for 11 years
when he met you.

343
00:20:36,693 --> 00:20:38,654
He's happy for us, trust me.

344
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:40,697
[sighs]

345
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:45,285
Cecil. Mr. Colby. Or should I
call you Dad? It's probably too soon.

346
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:48,413
Fallon. We meet again,
under better circumstances.

347
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,793
I apologize for my behavior
the last time we met.

348
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:56,546
Oh, no worries. I can only imagine
what years of tiny televisions,

349
00:20:56,630 --> 00:21:00,968
toilet wine and bologna sandwiches can do.
I watched <i>Locked Up Abroad.</i>

350
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:04,680
Well, at the time, I only knew you
as the daughter of the man

351
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:08,183
-that tried to steal my son's invention.
-[Fallon] Don't worry.

352
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:10,978
I'm used to being considered a D-bag
by relation.

353
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:15,524
It's funny, my dad always claimed
that Jeff tried to steal tech from him.

354
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:19,319
But why would he wanna steal anything?
My fiancé is a genius.

355
00:21:24,908 --> 00:21:27,953
-And you're a genius, too. Thank you.
-I got your back.

356
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:29,871
Keep an eye out for my signal.

357
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:32,082
Dinner's ready.

358
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:33,709
Shall we?

359
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:08,577
Excuse me, doctor.
How much do you want for your earrings?

360
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:20,255
[Fallon] So, tell me, Mr. Colby,

361
00:22:20,964 --> 00:22:23,675
what were you doing
before your, you know...?

362
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:25,719
-Incarceration?
-Yeah.

363
00:22:25,802 --> 00:22:28,221
Before that, I was working in a chem lab.

364
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:32,017
Didn't pay much, but I had a gift
for making things out of nothing.

365
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:33,727
Like my son.

366
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:39,274
Michael, Monica tells me
you drive for the Carringtons.

367
00:22:39,357 --> 00:22:43,987
-Culhane is much more to us than a driver.
-His last name's practically Carrington.

368
00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:45,155
Well, look at that.

369
00:22:45,238 --> 00:22:48,325
Sure seems like the Colbys
can't resist the Carringtons, huh? Feeling is mutual.
Your daughter is an amazing woman,

370
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,331
and I'm glad to get to meet her father.

371
00:22:54,414 --> 00:22:56,875
I look forward
to meeting Mrs. Colby one day.

372
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:02,172
Too bad Mrs. Colby left me
when I ended up in the slammer.

373
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:04,841
[clears throat]

374
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:09,554
Jeff and I agreed to a fall wedding,
which is a mere six months away.

375
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:13,809
If we plan on rivaling George and Amal's
opus, we should start planning.

376
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:16,561
Don't tell me you're turning
into bridezilla already.

377
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:24,194
-Do we need to get that resized?
-No.

378
00:23:24,402 --> 00:23:26,446
No. I prefer it a little loose.

379
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:27,906
[Monica] Just like you.

380
00:23:27,989 --> 00:23:29,574
-Well, not anymore.
-Yes.

381
00:23:30,283 --> 00:23:31,493
Oh, my God!

382
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:34,246
Culhane! This is silk velvet!

383
00:23:34,329 --> 00:23:37,374
Some poor worker went blind
hand-sewing these feathers.

384
00:23:37,457 --> 00:23:40,168
I have to get this cleaned up
before it's ruined.

385
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:46,466
Charming.

386
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:51,555
[Rick] There's an art to covering
politics, and the <i>Mirror</i> gets that.

387
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:55,517
-Great newspaper.
-Part of the reason I'm there is Cristal.

388
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,145
I pointed you
in the right direction, but...

389
00:23:58,228 --> 00:24:00,647
Your wife's a modest
and incredible woman.

390
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:06,027
I would have done the same
for any other colleague with potential.

391
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:10,532
Well, generosity, it's the Carrington way.

392
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:14,828
In fact, why don't I float your name
for a contributor gig at CNN?

393
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:19,124
Didn't they just fire one of their people
for inappropriate conduct?

394
00:24:19,207 --> 00:24:22,043
Honey, Rick's a journalist,
not a TV personality.

395
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:23,962
He's handsome enough to be one.

396
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:28,258
Apparently all he needs to do
is keep it in his pants.

397
00:24:28,341 --> 00:24:29,759
[Rick chuckles]

398
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:33,930
You just let me know, Rick. I owe you.
Not just for the Steven interviews,

399
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:37,475
but for squashing
the Senator Daniels bribery story.

400
00:24:38,101 --> 00:24:41,188
I hope that my wife did a proper job
of thanking you.

401
00:24:58,163 --> 00:24:59,623
[Jeff] What are you doing?

402
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:03,376
I was just looking for your laundry room.

403
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:07,214
-But I barely know what one looks like.
-That's a closet.

404
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:08,215
Ah!

405
00:25:08,298 --> 00:25:11,301
What do you think?
You think it needs stain remover?

406
00:25:11,384 --> 00:25:13,595
Silk velvet? Already a goner.

407
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:17,140
But I'll buy you three more
if you'll come back to dinner.

408
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:21,144
You really are too good to be true.

409
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:37,202
[shudders]

410
00:25:46,419 --> 00:25:48,213
Holy hell!

411
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:52,425
[knocking on door]

412
00:25:54,844 --> 00:25:59,140
I just came to say that I'm sorry,
for everything you're going through.

413
00:25:59,557 --> 00:26:01,268
My prayers are with you and--

414
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:03,019
Is that...?

415
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:09,317
Oh, my God.
I can't believe Ted held onto this.

416
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:10,735
What you talking about?

417
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:14,489
I get why your son didn't tell you
about us, given our history.

418
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:20,578
But I want you to know that his recovery
has always been my priority.

419
00:26:21,121 --> 00:26:24,541
I pushed him to go back to church,
to rebuild his faith, not just in God, but in himself.

420
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:32,132
I gave him my cross earring

421
00:26:32,215 --> 00:26:36,803
as a symbol that someone
would always be watching over him...

422
00:26:37,637 --> 00:26:39,222
even when I couldn't.

423
00:26:43,893 --> 00:26:44,728
You...

424
00:26:46,062 --> 00:26:48,732
You helped my boy find God again?

425
00:26:49,607 --> 00:26:51,526
He helped me, too, Gerry.

426
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,363
The key to recovery...

427
00:26:57,073 --> 00:26:58,783
is faith in a higher power.

428
00:27:04,247 --> 00:27:05,999
Would you pray with me?

429
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:15,592
[groans]

430
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:18,720
Dad?

431
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:21,598
Steven?

432
00:27:27,854 --> 00:27:30,065
-I don't--
-It's all right.

433
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:32,817
-Sam.
-His vitals are stabilizing,

434
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:34,527
but based on his MRI,

435
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:37,864
after severe brain trauma like his
in the temporal lobe,

436
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:42,369
it may be a while before he makes sense
of his thoughts, if ever.

437
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:46,247
Sammy Jo...?

438
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:51,378
Son, what are you trying to say?

439
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:54,047
Steven.

440
00:27:54,422 --> 00:27:57,008
Listen to me, Ted.
You had a terrible fall.

441
00:27:57,842 --> 00:28:00,929
You came to me, and you were high, again.

442
00:28:01,304 --> 00:28:03,807
You weren't yourself, but you're okay now.

443
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:06,142
-Just tell me you understand that.
-No.

444
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:09,020
Not you.

445
00:28:10,313 --> 00:28:12,107
[Gerry] Son, listen to him.

446
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:16,236
Steven's been right here,
every second, right beside you.

447
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:17,987
He truly cares for you.

448
00:28:21,991 --> 00:28:26,287
And I care enough to know
that this moment can't be about me.

449
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:28,957
What's happened here is a miracle.

450
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:34,254
This is Ted's second chance at life.
Your second chance to reconnect.

451
00:28:34,337 --> 00:28:35,672
I'll stay in touch.

452
00:28:36,631 --> 00:28:40,593
But right now... he needs his father.

453
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:57,110
Thank you, Steven.

454
00:28:58,611 --> 00:28:59,863
For all you've done.

455
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:11,040
Everything okay?

456
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:16,337
Yeah. Let's just say, Fallon's not used
to doing her own laundry.

457
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:20,633
I have help. A fully staffed kitchen.
You do not wanna let me near a kitchen.

458
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:23,261
So, have you two set a date?

459
00:29:23,344 --> 00:29:25,805
We haven't, really. But you know what?

460
00:29:26,639 --> 00:29:29,058
You're eager for this to happen. So am I.

461
00:29:29,142 --> 00:29:33,313
Why are we waiting? Why not two weeks
from now? The venue's available.

462
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:37,650
Well, I can hardly plan the event
of the season in two weeks.

463
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:40,570
Throw enough money,
you can make anything work.

464
00:29:40,653 --> 00:29:44,449
Your father and Cristal did it in a couple
of days. Two weeks is plenty of time.

465
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:47,619
Unless you have a reason to delay.

466
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:51,623
Maybe Fallon just wants to enjoy
the engagement, and do things right.

467
00:29:54,417 --> 00:29:56,544
Is it your commitment issues again?

468
00:29:56,628 --> 00:30:00,799
Rip off the Band-Aid before you ruin
the best thing that's happened to you.

469
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:02,383
Aside from me, of course.

470
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:04,803
No, no, it's not that.

471
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:05,929
Then what is it?

472
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:08,640
Um...

473
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:09,974
You know what?

474
00:30:10,725 --> 00:30:11,935
You're right.

475
00:30:12,018 --> 00:30:13,394
I don't need to be Amal.

476
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:15,271
I can be Britney,

477
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:17,857
without the shaved head
and the Vegas chapel.

478
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:25,281
My God. I just realized this will make us
sisters. How crazy will that be?

479
00:30:27,867 --> 00:30:29,536
I can't watch this anymore.

480
00:30:30,703 --> 00:30:34,541
You all make me sick.
I don't recognize my own children!

481
00:30:34,624 --> 00:30:36,668
Dad, what are you talking about?

482
00:30:36,751 --> 00:30:40,213
My only son, cozying up to the daughter

483
00:30:40,296 --> 00:30:43,049
-of the very man that put me in prison.
-Dad--!

484
00:30:43,132 --> 00:30:44,092
-What?
-Yeah.

485
00:30:45,593 --> 00:30:49,806
I wasn't a drug addict as your father
claimed to the rest of the world.

486
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:52,892
Your father framed me.

487
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:54,978
That's insane.

488
00:30:55,061 --> 00:30:56,563
[Cecil] Ask your fiancé.

489
00:30:56,646 --> 00:30:57,814
Your best friend.

490
00:30:58,606 --> 00:31:00,942
They'll tell you, he framed me...

491
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:05,196
right after he screwed my wife.

492
00:31:06,447 --> 00:31:09,576
And when I threatened to kill him
for taking her away,

493
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:14,205
he took everything else away from me.
He took my children, he took my freedom.

494
00:31:14,747 --> 00:31:19,419
He planted blow in my car
and had his dirty cop friend arrest me.

495
00:31:19,502 --> 00:31:21,588
Had his dirty judge lock me away.

496
00:31:22,171 --> 00:31:24,048
No. That can't be true.

497
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:28,052
Go on, deny it, when you know
it sounds like your daddy's MO! No!

498
00:31:28,344 --> 00:31:30,847
I will not stand by...

499
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:35,435
and watch my only son...

500
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:39,272
marry that bastard's dirty daughter.

506
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:15,683
Dad always made me believe
my mom was the bad one.

507
00:32:16,809 --> 00:32:17,810
What do you mean?

508
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:24,400
He said that she was the one
who cheated.

509
00:32:27,362 --> 00:32:29,781
That she was an awful person who left us.

510
00:32:30,239 --> 00:32:33,534
Left me, and left him.

511
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:41,501
A shrink might even say
that sometimes I thought it was my fault.

512
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:43,044
Fallon.

513
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:45,922

00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:08,194
I didn't think you could get
all your thongs into one suitcase.

518
00:33:08,277 --> 00:33:11,364
Of things you've done,
this has to be the most idiotic.

519
00:33:11,447 --> 00:33:14,242
-How do--?
-I just got a call from the front gate.

520
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:17,662
There was a Lyft driver there.
So, I sent him away.

521
00:33:17,745 --> 00:33:21,124
-They charge a cancellation fee.
-Why are you doing this?

522
00:33:21,207 --> 00:33:23,584
I'm tired of being a strain
on this family.

523
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:28,089
If I'm not here, I can't drag Steven
or anyone else down with me.

524
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:32,176
I have to say, I wasn't expecting you
to pull a Sammy Jo and run away.

525
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:35,013
I was hoping
you might do something different.

526
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:37,932
This family's invested
a lot of energy and money,

527
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:41,811
in payoffs, blackmail and carbs,

528
00:33:41,894 --> 00:33:43,062
to keep you around.

529
00:33:43,896 --> 00:33:47,817
They value you. It would be silly
to walk away and have it wasted.

530
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:51,654
Well, you don't understand.
It's not just because I'm a burden.

531
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:54,532
I can't stay. I'm not here legally.

532
00:33:54,615 --> 00:33:57,285
Of course I understand.
I've been through it.

533
00:33:57,785 --> 00:34:00,663
Or did you think this Kiwi accent
was just for show?

534
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:08,671
Now, this is the number of an immigration
lawyer. I've set up an appointment.

535
00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:12,467
Tomorrow, we'll start work
on your case together.

536
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:19,307
This is the nicest thing
anyone's ever done for me.

537
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:22,435
Aside from keeping me out
of a murder investigation. [chuckles]

538
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:27,231
Don't screw it up. You'll break
more than one heart if you do.

539
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:28,649
[chuckles]

540
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:38,701
[Rick] Dinner was excellent.

541
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:41,162
-See you.
-If Steven's numbers

542
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:42,747
are any indication, I'll be around.

543
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:46,959
Great guy.

544
00:34:47,877 --> 00:34:51,798
Why did he send you flowers?
I saw the way he looked at you.

545
00:34:52,965 --> 00:34:55,301
We had a thing, a brief thing,

546
00:34:55,384 --> 00:34:58,429
-before I came to C.A.
-Brief enough to lie about flowers?

547
00:34:58,513 --> 00:35:01,099
It didn't mean anything,
and it was a long time ago.

548
00:35:04,393 --> 00:35:07,605
Men don't just send gifts
to reminisce about old times.

549
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:11,275
Something else happen
between you two recently?

550
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:15,863
We were working late together
on Steven's interview,

551
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:19,450
and I think he got the wrong impression,
and he kissed me.

552
00:35:19,534 --> 00:35:22,370
But it's a harmless crush,
and I shut him down.

553
00:35:23,746 --> 00:35:26,791
He doesn't care about you.
He's using you to get to me.

554
00:35:26,874 --> 00:35:30,169
I've had a tail on Jeff Colby
since the parole hearing.

555
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:32,713
And Anders caught Rick meeting with Jeff.

556
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:34,924
-I don't understand.
-Well, I do.

557
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:37,468
Even pure idealists have a price.

558
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:40,680
And Colby's found Rick's,
and now we're gonna beat it.

559
00:35:40,763 --> 00:35:44,642
-When do you see him again?
-I'm not. I told him that can't happen,

560
00:35:44,725 --> 00:35:47,311
-he has to stay away.
-I don't want him to get away.

561
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:52,191
Get as close to him as you possibly can.

562
00:36:00,116 --> 00:36:03,744
-Are you telling me to keep seeing Rick?
-Perfect opportunity.

563
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:06,914
He has no idea you know
about his ties to the Colbys.

564
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:10,710
-I need to find out what Jeff is up to.
-You listening to yourself?

565
00:36:10,793 --> 00:36:16,257
Yes, I am. Are you? You did
whatever it took to protect your family.

566
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:18,551
Sam. What about the rest of us?

567
00:36:19,093 --> 00:36:22,513
So, what if you have to take advantage
of a harmless crush?

568
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:28,978
-Unless it isn't harmless.
-I shouldn't be surprised.

569
00:36:30,479 --> 00:36:33,149
I mean, you whored your son out
to the press.

570
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:35,651
Why not do the same to your wife?

571
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:39,697
You may think that you can buy everyone,
Blake Carrington,

572
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:43,784
but I am sure as hell
not letting you put a price tag on me.

573
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:51,584
[Steven] Going somewhere? Not anymore.

574
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:56,923
Good.
Because you're officially in the clear.

575
00:36:57,006 --> 00:37:00,384
Admiral Gerard Dinard
even sang my praises to the press

576
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:02,720
before taking Ted to rehab in Indiana.

577
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:06,724
Which means that my campaign base
has now broadened

578
00:37:06,807 --> 00:37:09,268
to include the U.S. military.

579
00:37:09,352 --> 00:37:12,396
Wait. The guy's name is Gerard Dinard?

580
00:37:13,022 --> 00:37:14,190
Yeah. [chuckles]

581
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:18,236
Just when you thought that family
couldn't get any more screwed up.

582
00:37:18,778 --> 00:37:19,612
What's that?

583
00:37:19,695 --> 00:37:23,783
I mean, it's more Hall &amp; Oates
than George Michael,

584
00:37:23,866 --> 00:37:26,035
but I can get used to it.

585
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:29,664
Anyway, I just wanted to give you...

586
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:31,207
this.

587
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:34,752
You got it back.

588
00:37:35,294 --> 00:37:37,880
Well, not that I need it.
You said it yourself.

589
00:37:37,964 --> 00:37:38,881
I have you now.

590
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:45,846
Sam, after everything I said about Ted,

591
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:50,268
I can't turn 180
and suddenly be with you now.

592
00:37:51,018 --> 00:37:53,771
I'm in the spotlight,
and the more you're with me,

593
00:37:53,854 --> 00:37:57,441
the bigger the chance
that someone will uncover your status.

594
00:37:57,525 --> 00:38:00,027
That's not gonna be an issue anymore.

595
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:02,571
Also, I...

596
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:06,617
I have a real chance at winning.

597
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:10,663
Of finally making a difference.

598
00:38:11,038 --> 00:38:14,292
Of showing my dad
that I can be more than just his son.

599
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:16,752
But I have to keep up the ruse...

600
00:38:17,586 --> 00:38:18,879
for that to happen.

601
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:25,011
I'm just so close to succeeding
at something, Sam.

602
00:38:26,595 --> 00:38:28,514
You have to understand that.

603
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:31,392
I do now.

604
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:40,151
You know, I have to hand it to Ted.
He got what he wanted after all.

605
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:54,582
[indistinct chatter over TV]

606
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:57,585
What the hell, Dad?

607
00:38:57,752 --> 00:39:01,213
We are so close. You might have gone
and destroyed everything.

608
00:39:01,297 --> 00:39:04,383
You've put my relationship
with Fallon in jeopardy,

609
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:07,178
a relationship I have been working on
for months.

610
00:39:07,261 --> 00:39:11,390
You know, sometimes you make me
almost ashamed of being a Colby.

611
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:13,601
Then change your name. I don't mind.

612
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:17,021
In fact, maybe you should change it
to Carrington.

613
00:39:17,313 --> 00:39:21,901
Yeah, I see how you look at her.
You're getting close to that family, son.

614
00:39:25,321 --> 00:39:28,199
While I was behind bars,
you were being showered

615
00:39:28,282 --> 00:39:31,494
in scholarships, jobs, a fiancé,
by our very enemy.

616
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:35,206
-You're gonna blink, son.
-That is ridiculous.

617
00:39:35,289 --> 00:39:37,666
I feel nothing but ice
for the Carringtons.

618
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:42,463
How can you? How you tell it,
Carrington practically raised you.

619
00:39:42,546 --> 00:39:46,509
He robbed me of being a real father
to you for all these years.

620
00:39:47,093 --> 00:39:49,845
But better late than never.
I'm gonna step up now,

621
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:53,641
-starting with that plan of yours.
-What are you talking about?

622
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:55,434
I have done all of this for you.

623
00:39:56,644 --> 00:40:00,564
A son should not have to pay
for his father's sins.

624
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:06,070
I was wrong to get you twisted up
in this war, my war.

625
00:40:06,153 --> 00:40:10,199
But now the only way to end it
is for me to end it myself.

626
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:13,536
You're done, Jeff.

627
00:40:16,997 --> 00:40:18,290
I'm taking over. Daddy's home.

628
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:32,471
Wondering when you were gonna get back.
What were you doing at Colby's?

629
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:34,932
-You had me followed?
-I had Jeff followed.

630
00:40:35,015 --> 00:40:37,017
You've been spending an awful lot of time
with that family.

631
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:41,063
Spending time with them is the only way
for me to learn about mine.

632
00:40:41,147 --> 00:40:43,941
-You had an affair with Jeff's mom.
-Cecil tell you that?

633
00:40:44,024 --> 00:40:46,360
How you framed him and locked him away.

634
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:51,198
-Your own marriage started falling apart.
-Did he mention that he tried to kill me?

635
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:53,826
-The man is unstable.
-It all makes sense now.

636
00:40:53,909 --> 00:40:57,496
You made me think Mom was the whore
that destroyed your marriage

637
00:40:57,580 --> 00:41:00,124
when you were the monster
who pushed her away.

638
00:41:00,207 --> 00:41:03,294
-You destroyed our family.
-I was protecting our family.

639
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:06,630
-And I never slept with Cecil's wife.
-God.

640
00:41:07,506 --> 00:41:11,135
I have been drowning in guilt
that I didn't listen to you.

641
00:41:12,595 --> 00:41:15,097
-That I let Jeff bug our server.
-You what?

642
00:41:15,931 --> 00:41:19,768
Back when I was trying to help Cristal,
the actual whore you married!

643
00:41:19,852 --> 00:41:21,937
I screwed up, I was trying to fix it.

644
00:41:22,021 --> 00:41:25,483
I got engaged to Jeff
so he wouldn't suspect I was onto him!

645
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:28,110
Engaged? The two of you were dating?

646
00:41:30,029 --> 00:41:30,905
[slams desk]

647
00:41:30,988 --> 00:41:32,198
Seriously?

648
00:41:32,281 --> 00:41:34,742
That is what you care about right now?

649
00:41:35,367 --> 00:41:36,911
Screw you, Dad.

650
00:41:36,994 --> 00:41:41,290
Screw the Colbys for letting you rile them
into this ridiculous family feud.

651
00:41:41,373 --> 00:41:43,501
-I am done with all of you.
-Honey...

652
00:41:44,293 --> 00:41:45,544
you did screw up.

653
00:41:46,212 --> 00:41:47,421
More than you know.

654
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:50,674
You got us into this mess,
so you're gonna dig us out.

655
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:53,761
Don't tell me what to do.
I don't arrange my life

656
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:56,639
to suit the gospel
according to Blake Carrington.

657
00:41:56,889 --> 00:41:59,642
I am done with you,
and I am done with Jeff.

658
00:41:59,725 --> 00:42:01,101
No, you're not!

659
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:05,147
You're gonna marry that son of a bitch.
