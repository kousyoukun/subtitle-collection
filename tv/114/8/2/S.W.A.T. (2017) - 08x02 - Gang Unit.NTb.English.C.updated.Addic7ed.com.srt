1
00:00:00,966 --> 00:00:02,168
Previously on SWAT...

2
00:00:02,192 --> 00:00:04,436
With my retirement coming up,
I need to choose someone

3
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:06,503
to take over SWAT Academy for me.

4
00:00:06,527 --> 00:00:07,896
I'm honored. That means a lot, Deac.

5
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,637
You're gonna do an amazing job, Victor.

6
00:00:09,661 --> 00:00:11,987
I guess even retirement can't
stop you from saving the city.

7
00:00:12,011 --> 00:00:13,728
I'm never gonna be able
to ignore the call.

8
00:00:13,752 --> 00:00:15,033
This is where I belong.

9
00:00:15,057 --> 00:00:16,600
If we're gonna rebuild

10
00:00:16,624 --> 00:00:18,124
this department,
you get carte blanche

11
00:00:18,148 --> 00:00:19,944
on the pick for six slot,
whoever you want.

12
00:00:19,968 --> 00:00:22,171
- How did Gamble do out there?
- Good, good.

13
00:00:22,195 --> 00:00:23,607
She's quick on her feet,
she seems sharp.

14
00:00:23,631 --> 00:00:24,947
So what's the issue?

15
00:00:24,971 --> 00:00:26,958
Commander, are you gonna blame
her for what her father did?

16
00:00:26,982 --> 00:00:29,613
I don't blame her, Hondo,
but she brings a lot of baggage.

17
00:00:29,637 --> 00:00:32,162
Gamble is the right person for this job.

18
00:00:35,861 --> 00:00:37,926
The only thing worse
than a day-long barricade

19
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:39,362
is one that ends with a sudden sprint

20
00:00:39,386 --> 00:00:40,972
through downtown.
Think I pulled my hammy.

21
00:00:40,996 --> 00:00:42,800
They had 12 hours inside that bank

22
00:00:42,824 --> 00:00:44,280
to think of an escape plan,

23
00:00:44,304 --> 00:00:46,152
and the best those
geniuses could come up with

24
00:00:46,176 --> 00:00:47,457
is to runfor it?

25
00:00:47,481 --> 00:00:50,286
Not everyone who moves to L.A.
is a creative, Deac.

26
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:51,853
Gamble, did they have
criminals that dumb

27
00:00:51,877 --> 00:00:53,028
up in Oakland?

28
00:00:53,052 --> 00:00:55,378
A few. Ours tended to attack with guns,
not the money itself.

29
00:00:55,402 --> 00:00:56,640
I can't believe they thought

30
00:00:56,664 --> 00:00:58,076
throwing cash at us would slow us down.

31
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,295
I can't believe Gamble jumped in the way

32
00:00:59,319 --> 00:01:00,340
just to protect Miko.

33
00:01:00,364 --> 00:01:02,309
If that's the worst bullet
I got to take for this team...

34
00:01:02,333 --> 00:01:04,009
Hey, she knows I got a date tonight.

35
00:01:04,033 --> 00:01:05,432
Getting hit by that dye pack
would have been worse

36
00:01:05,456 --> 00:01:06,824
than a bullet, believe me.

37
00:01:06,848 --> 00:01:08,217
So, Gamble, one week on the job

38
00:01:08,241 --> 00:01:09,392
and you already need a new vest.

39
00:01:09,416 --> 00:01:12,003
You know, the city's gonna take
that out of your paycheck, right?

40
00:01:12,027 --> 00:01:14,223
Those are the rules around here, Gamble.

41
00:01:14,247 --> 00:01:15,565
You break it, you bought it.

42
00:01:15,589 --> 00:01:17,052
Welcome to the LAPD.

43
00:01:17,076 --> 00:01:18,184
That's not fair, boss.

44
00:01:18,208 --> 00:01:19,382
She took one for me.

45
00:01:20,077 --> 00:01:21,143
I'll take this for her.

46
00:01:21,167 --> 00:01:22,797
Okay, Mr. Hospitality.

47
00:01:22,821 --> 00:01:23,667
Let's go.

48
00:01:25,693 --> 00:01:27,216
Team's gelling, Hondo.

49
00:01:27,613 --> 00:01:28,565
You did good.

50
00:01:28,822 --> 00:01:29,870
Thanks, man.

51
00:01:30,157 --> 00:01:31,632
Hey, Hondo. You mind taking a look

52
00:01:31,656 --> 00:01:33,764
at a few proposals
for SWAT Academy changes?

53
00:01:33,788 --> 00:01:35,331
I want to run 'em by Hicks tomorrow.

54
00:01:35,355 --> 00:01:36,637
Uh, changes?

55
00:01:36,661 --> 00:01:39,161
I just had a few ideas
on how to incorporate our gear

56
00:01:39,185 --> 00:01:40,815
into the curriculum.
Our tools are getting

57
00:01:40,839 --> 00:01:42,208
more advanced,
we should be looking for people

58
00:01:42,232 --> 00:01:43,209
who know how to use them.

59
00:01:43,233 --> 00:01:44,514
I don't think that's wise.

60
00:01:44,538 --> 00:01:46,647
We gotta teach these kids how to walk

61
00:01:46,671 --> 00:01:48,585
before we can let them play with toys.

62
00:01:48,884 --> 00:01:50,935
SWAT Academy, it's about fundamentals.

63
00:01:51,261 --> 00:01:53,871
It's tech we use every day,
Deac. It is fundamental.

64
00:01:53,895 --> 00:01:54,895
Okay, hey, hey.

65
00:01:55,182 --> 00:01:56,831
I know SWAT Academy was your baby,

66
00:01:56,855 --> 00:01:58,876
but you gave up the reins
to Tan when you retired.

67
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:00,356
Now just cause you're back,
that doesn't change.

68
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:01,662
Come on, man.

69
00:02:01,686 --> 00:02:03,513
You gotta let the kid do his own thing.

70
00:02:04,024 --> 00:02:05,492
Yeah. No, of course.

71
00:02:05,516 --> 00:02:07,361
You're right.

72
00:02:07,909 --> 00:02:09,365
That actually sounds pretty good.

73
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:10,932
Yeah. You're gonna like this stuff.

74
00:02:10,956 --> 00:02:12,827
It's all right. Just keep me updated.

75
00:02:23,925 --> 00:02:26,034
One.

76
00:02:26,058 --> 00:02:27,340
Two.

77
00:02:27,364 --> 00:02:28,689
Three.

78
00:02:28,713 --> 00:02:30,995
Bruh, you can't do that in your head?

79
00:02:31,019 --> 00:02:32,693
You're killing my rhythm.

80
00:02:32,717 --> 00:02:34,216
What, you want me to mess up the amount?

81
00:02:35,589 --> 00:02:37,263
It's ten to a bag.

82
00:02:37,287 --> 00:02:38,936
You really need help counting to ten?

83
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,267
Oh.

84
00:02:54,304 --> 00:02:55,566
Aw.

85
00:03:56,714 --> 00:03:59,040
Thanks for coming on such short notice.

86
00:03:59,064 --> 00:04:00,607
Wasn't far for me, sir.

87
00:04:00,631 --> 00:04:01,825
What are we looking at?

88
00:04:01,849 --> 00:04:03,349
A robbery gone very wrong.

89
00:04:03,373 --> 00:04:05,351
That's a Compton Tiger stash house

90
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:07,004
across the street. Someone cleared

91
00:04:07,028 --> 00:04:08,484
the place out.
The only thing they left behind

92
00:04:08,508 --> 00:04:10,181
were four dead bodies.

93
00:04:10,205 --> 00:04:12,096
Looks like a fifth tried
to make a run for it,

94
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,837
but he didn't get far.

95
00:04:13,861 --> 00:04:15,361
And the civilian?

96
00:04:15,385 --> 00:04:16,623
Some poor woman
who picked the wrong time

97
00:04:16,647 --> 00:04:17,972
to take out the trash.

98
00:04:17,996 --> 00:04:19,756
Social services are with her kids now.

99
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:21,236
Look, the mayor doesn't like waking up

100
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:24,081
to photos of dead mothers
on the front of The Times.

101
00:04:24,105 --> 00:04:26,170
He wants LAPD's best on it.

102
00:04:26,388 --> 00:04:27,633
That means 20-Squad.

103
00:04:27,657 --> 00:04:28,895
Mr. Mayor doesn't need

104
00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:30,723
to get his satin panties in a bunch.

105
00:04:30,747 --> 00:04:32,619
L.A.'s best is already here.

106
00:04:33,489 --> 00:04:36,468
Lieutenant Raul Vignisson.
L.A. Sheriff's Department.

107
00:04:36,492 --> 00:04:37,687
Commander Hicks.

108
00:04:37,711 --> 00:04:40,254
Vignisson. You run the
sheriff's Gang Suppression Unit.

109
00:04:40,278 --> 00:04:42,039
That's a pretty elite squad.
I know a bunch

110
00:04:42,063 --> 00:04:43,344
of deputies who would
give up their pension

111
00:04:43,368 --> 00:04:44,868
for a shot to ride with the GSU.

112
00:04:44,892 --> 00:04:47,087
There's always a spot open
for the Hondo Harrelson

113
00:04:47,111 --> 00:04:49,002
if you ever feel like switching teams.

114
00:04:49,026 --> 00:04:50,569
You think the action is hot here?

115
00:04:50,593 --> 00:04:53,074
Wait till you leave city limits.

116
00:04:53,913 --> 00:04:55,443
Start getting statements
from the neighbors.

117
00:04:55,467 --> 00:04:56,531
Every detail matters.

118
00:04:56,555 --> 00:04:58,359
Yeah, no one told me the LASD

119
00:04:58,383 --> 00:04:59,883
was joining us this morning.

120
00:04:59,907 --> 00:05:01,754
Afraid SWAT's the one actually
crashing the party.

121
00:05:01,778 --> 00:05:03,147
My team's been hunting the crew

122
00:05:03,171 --> 00:05:04,888
behind these stash house hits
for weeks now.

123
00:05:04,912 --> 00:05:07,064
You mean this isn't the first
house they've knocked over?

124
00:05:07,088 --> 00:05:08,631
Try four... so far.

125
00:05:08,655 --> 00:05:10,720
Same pattern every time.

126
00:05:10,744 --> 00:05:12,112
They come in hard, fast,

127
00:05:12,136 --> 00:05:14,051
and they don't leave
a single person alive.

128
00:05:17,968 --> 00:05:19,293
Wasn't a forced entry.
The bolt's not broken.

129
00:05:19,317 --> 00:05:21,382
Shooters must've known the secret code,

130
00:05:21,406 --> 00:05:23,776
caught the Tigers by surprise.

131
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,430
They did their research.

132
00:05:25,454 --> 00:05:26,779
Do we know what they took?

133
00:05:26,803 --> 00:05:28,738
Our CIs say this was
the central weigh station

134
00:05:28,762 --> 00:05:30,304
for the Tigers' entire operation.

135
00:05:30,328 --> 00:05:32,959
Drugs, money, weapons,
they kept it all here.

136
00:05:32,983 --> 00:05:35,135
Oh, a pharmacy, bank and
an armory job all in one.

137
00:05:35,159 --> 00:05:36,659
And now, all that product

138
00:05:36,683 --> 00:05:37,964
and firepower's in the hands of a crew

139
00:05:37,988 --> 00:05:39,009
that's showing no signs of stopping.

140
00:05:39,033 --> 00:05:40,314
We'd appreciate all the files

141
00:05:40,338 --> 00:05:41,664
your team's collected so far.

142
00:05:41,688 --> 00:05:43,486
We're going to find these killers
before they hurt anyone else.

143
00:05:44,821 --> 00:05:46,799
All due respect, but this case is still

144
00:05:46,823 --> 00:05:48,540
an active Sheriff's
Department investigation.

145
00:05:48,564 --> 00:05:51,108
Maybe, but last night's murders
crossed into city limits.

146
00:05:51,132 --> 00:05:52,936
Means it's an LAPD case now, too.

147
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,720
Thanks, but no thanks.

148
00:05:54,744 --> 00:05:56,983
We're already
miles ahead of you on this.

149
00:05:57,007 --> 00:05:58,028
Miles ahead?

150
00:05:58,052 --> 00:05:59,594
This was the crew's fourth hit.

151
00:05:59,618 --> 00:06:02,936
And you said yourself, you've
been after these guys with no luck.

152
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,687
Doesn't mean we're stepping aside.

153
00:06:04,711 --> 00:06:06,166
Okay, hold on, now.

154
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:07,907
Vignisson, the more houses
this crew rolls over,

155
00:06:07,931 --> 00:06:09,981
the more guns they get,
the more dangerous they are.

156
00:06:10,005 --> 00:06:11,911
If we don't stop 'em,
that woman next door's

157
00:06:11,935 --> 00:06:14,392
not gonna be the only innocent
caught up in the crossfire.

158
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:16,897
We're offering a fresh set of eyes.

159
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:21,051
My team would be happy
for SWAT's assistance.

160
00:06:21,075 --> 00:06:23,270
But this is still a GSU case.

161
00:06:23,294 --> 00:06:25,359
We run this from our station, our way.

162
00:06:25,383 --> 00:06:26,733
We're calling the shots.

163
00:06:27,559 --> 00:06:28,798
All right, then.

164
00:06:28,822 --> 00:06:30,147
I'll call my team and
tell them to buckle up.

165
00:06:30,171 --> 00:06:32,128
SWAT's riding with the sheriffs today.

166
00:06:32,709 --> 00:06:34,001
Right on.

168
00:07:14,912 --> 00:07:16,803
Yo, 20-Squad. Over here.

169
00:07:16,827 --> 00:07:18,196
Welcome to South Central Station.

170
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:19,545
Not as polished as your place,

171
00:07:19,569 --> 00:07:20,894
but we make up for it with raw talent.

172
00:07:20,918 --> 00:07:22,369
I'm Cesar, this is Lang.

173
00:07:22,393 --> 00:07:23,948
Deacon and Tan.

174
00:07:23,972 --> 00:07:25,247
We know the GSU's rep.

175
00:07:25,271 --> 00:07:27,075
- You guys don't mess around.
- Yeah. It's true.

176
00:07:27,099 --> 00:07:28,815
Hey, nice to see a friendly face.

177
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:31,383
You ever get tired of being the
best looking guy on your team?

178
00:07:31,407 --> 00:07:32,558
Nah, never gets old.

179
00:07:32,582 --> 00:07:33,777
So, listen, we move pretty fast

180
00:07:33,801 --> 00:07:34,940
around here, so if you guys

181
00:07:34,964 --> 00:07:36,388
need us to slow down so
you can catch your breath,

182
00:07:36,412 --> 00:07:37,520
just say the word.

183
00:07:37,544 --> 00:07:38,912
Think we'llbe okay.

184
00:07:38,936 --> 00:07:41,219
SWAT only rolls out
when things are fast.

185
00:07:41,243 --> 00:07:43,003
When you're the last line
of defense like SWAT is,

186
00:07:43,027 --> 00:07:44,440
there's no one you can call for backup.

187
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,181
Must be nice, coming to the rescue

188
00:07:46,205 --> 00:07:48,226
after the rest of the LAPD

189
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:49,837
has done all the heavy lifting.

190
00:07:49,861 --> 00:07:51,751
Now, I seem to remember SWAT

191
00:07:51,775 --> 00:07:53,275
keeping the entire city
from burning to the ground

192
00:07:53,299 --> 00:07:55,233
this summer all by ourselves.

193
00:07:55,257 --> 00:07:57,192
All right, respect where respect's due.

194
00:07:57,216 --> 00:07:59,585
Yo, I saw you hanging
from that whirlybird on TV.

195
00:07:59,609 --> 00:08:00,934
Pretty sweet.

196
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:02,197
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
where's the love for the guy

197
00:08:02,221 --> 00:08:03,570
hanging off the back
of the speeding tanker?

198
00:08:04,843 --> 00:08:06,940
We done figuring out who's biggest?

199
00:08:06,964 --> 00:08:09,315
Come on, I'll show you
where the magic happens.

200
00:08:11,273 --> 00:08:12,598
Whoa.

201
00:08:12,622 --> 00:08:13,860
What do you know?

202
00:08:13,884 --> 00:08:14,861
You know that deputy?

203
00:08:14,885 --> 00:08:16,472
Yeah, that's Dobes.

204
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,952
That's my old partner from
way back in my patrol days.

205
00:08:18,976 --> 00:08:20,606
Let me tell you, we were
a force to be reckoned with.

206
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:21,825
We competed for everything.

207
00:08:21,849 --> 00:08:24,436
Arrests, accommodations, girls.

208
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:26,134
When did he join the
Sheriff's Department?

209
00:08:26,158 --> 00:08:28,266
I don't know. We kind of lost touch.

210
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:30,138
- You know, different life paths?
- Mm-hmm.

211
00:08:30,162 --> 00:08:31,922
We actually tried out for SWAT together.

212
00:08:31,946 --> 00:08:34,295
I made it, he didn't.

213
00:08:35,122 --> 00:08:36,935
Well, I'm sure he'd love
to see you and catch up, Deac.

214
00:08:37,259 --> 00:08:39,570
First partner's someone
you ride with for life.

215
00:08:40,394 --> 00:08:41,743
Hmm.

216
00:08:44,966 --> 00:08:47,972
This is the center
of the GSU's operation.

217
00:08:47,996 --> 00:08:50,245
From here, we keep tabs on
every gang in the county.

218
00:08:50,269 --> 00:08:53,030
If two kids share ink,
from Six Flags to Disneyland,

219
00:08:53,054 --> 00:08:54,684
you can bet your ass we know about it.

220
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:55,989
Here's everything we have

221
00:08:56,013 --> 00:08:57,906
on the stash house attacks so far.

222
00:08:57,930 --> 00:08:59,970
We marked all four robberies
on the map here.

223
00:08:59,995 --> 00:09:01,256
These guys are hardcore.

224
00:09:01,281 --> 00:09:02,709
They leave no physical evidence behind.

225
00:09:02,846 --> 00:09:04,476
Weapons seem to vary, too.

226
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,404
Automatics one job, shotguns the next.

227
00:09:06,428 --> 00:09:07,479
Never the same.

228
00:09:07,503 --> 00:09:09,220
Could be using the guns
they steal at one house

229
00:09:09,244 --> 00:09:11,091
to stick up the next.
Makes them harder to track.

230
00:09:11,115 --> 00:09:13,181
Robbing Peter to shoot Paul.

231
00:09:13,205 --> 00:09:14,965
So far, each of the stash
houses that have been hit

232
00:09:14,989 --> 00:09:16,662
- belonged to different gangs.
- Yes, sir.

233
00:09:16,686 --> 00:09:18,664
L2D's, Los Mags, 42's,

234
00:09:18,688 --> 00:09:21,319
all different sets with no
affiliation to one another.

235
00:09:21,343 --> 00:09:23,147
Our working theory is these thieves

236
00:09:23,171 --> 00:09:24,670
are being backed by a supplier.

237
00:09:24,694 --> 00:09:25,715
A cartel, maybe.

238
00:09:25,739 --> 00:09:27,020
You got another big board

239
00:09:27,044 --> 00:09:28,196
with cartel movements hiding somewhere?

240
00:09:29,247 --> 00:09:30,067
We don't

241
00:09:30,091 --> 00:09:31,547
keep as close an eye on them.

242
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:32,678
We stick to our own backyard.

243
00:09:32,702 --> 00:09:34,414
Well, it's a good thing we're here.

244
00:09:34,878 --> 00:09:37,205
Deac, let's have the team
run every LAPD database,

245
00:09:37,229 --> 00:09:38,684
and see if any major cartel players

246
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:40,996
have been spotted in L.A.
in the last month.

247
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:42,340
Tan, you start digging
through these files.

248
00:09:42,364 --> 00:09:43,689
Even if a cartel is behind this,

249
00:09:43,713 --> 00:09:45,888
someone local's helping 'em.

250
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:48,631
Does that sound good to you, Vignisson?

251
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:52,199
All I care about is
getting these scumbags.

252
00:09:52,826 --> 00:09:54,352
If you want to do all the leg work,

253
00:09:54,376 --> 00:09:56,267
I'll be happy
to take all the credit later.

254
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:58,598
Let's go get these bastards.

255
00:10:02,341 --> 00:10:03,361
Dobes?

256
00:10:03,385 --> 00:10:04,754
Damn.

257
00:10:04,778 --> 00:10:05,755
It really is you.

258
00:10:05,779 --> 00:10:07,323
Deacon.

259
00:10:07,347 --> 00:10:09,106
I heard SWAT was here,

260
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:10,150
but I didn't expect
to see you with them.

261
00:10:10,174 --> 00:10:11,543
Heard you retired.

262
00:10:11,567 --> 00:10:13,415
Yeah, well, I found it
pretty hard to quit.

263
00:10:13,439 --> 00:10:16,141
Uh, Hondo, this is Alex Doberstein.

264
00:10:16,659 --> 00:10:17,897
Deputy Doberstein these days.

265
00:10:17,921 --> 00:10:19,116
Nice to meet you, my man.

266
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:21,315
Deacon says the two of you
used to tear up Mid City.

267
00:10:21,938 --> 00:10:23,448
Back in the glory days, I guess.

268
00:10:23,732 --> 00:10:25,731
Before he became
a big time SWAT officer.

269
00:10:25,755 --> 00:10:27,124
So, uh, when did you hop over

270
00:10:27,148 --> 00:10:29,125
- to the Sheriff's Department?
- Ten years ago.

271
00:10:29,149 --> 00:10:30,388
Caught a few promotions in Wilshire,

272
00:10:30,412 --> 00:10:32,390
but started to get
a little belly behind the desk.

273
00:10:33,496 --> 00:10:35,959
It's not much better over here,
but at least I'm back on the street,

274
00:10:35,983 --> 00:10:38,048
- chasing bad guys.
- Well, you look great.

275
00:10:38,072 --> 00:10:39,571
Been training for Vignisson's Gang Unit.

276
00:10:39,595 --> 00:10:42,033
Hoping this is the year
a slot finally opens up.

277
00:10:42,057 --> 00:10:43,836
Those are the guys that
really get to have fun.

278
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:45,260
Well, we're working a case with GSU now.

279
00:10:45,284 --> 00:10:46,404
I-I could put in a word for you.

280
00:10:46,428 --> 00:10:47,492
I'm good, Deacon.

281
00:10:47,516 --> 00:10:50,190
Vignisson's the guy who
convinced me to come overto LASD.

282
00:10:50,214 --> 00:10:51,931
His team is tight, but...

283
00:10:51,955 --> 00:10:53,869
we're all one big family here.

284
00:10:54,156 --> 00:10:55,723
It's a nice feeling.

285
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:58,547
I got to run this paperwork upstairs.

286
00:10:58,571 --> 00:11:01,008
- It was nice to meet you, Hondo.
- Yeah.

287
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:06,946
Can't believe we're stuck
staring at screens

288
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:10,036
while the boys get to roll in
the field with the freaking GSU.

289
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:11,386
Happy working as far away

290
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:13,388
from those LASD blowhards as I can be.

291
00:11:13,412 --> 00:11:15,630
You know, I did a stint
with the LASD before SWAT.

292
00:11:15,992 --> 00:11:17,914
Uh, sorry, Powell. I...

293
00:11:17,938 --> 00:11:19,437
I didn't mean it. Um,

294
00:11:19,461 --> 00:11:21,898
it's a... personal thing.

295
00:11:24,466 --> 00:11:26,792
You know you don't have
to hold back with us.

296
00:11:26,816 --> 00:11:28,817
20-Squad's a family.

297
00:11:29,005 --> 00:11:31,623
Kind of our whole thing. Hmm.

298
00:11:31,647 --> 00:11:33,408
Uh, my experience,

299
00:11:33,432 --> 00:11:35,999
family can mean a lot
of different things.

300
00:11:38,805 --> 00:11:40,183
But thank you.

301
00:11:42,049 --> 00:11:43,983
I wasn't having luck
with traffic cams in the area,

302
00:11:44,007 --> 00:11:46,039
so I expanded my search.

303
00:11:46,063 --> 00:11:47,218
Caught this hotshot

304
00:11:47,242 --> 00:11:48,814
running a red, half-mile
from the crime scene.

305
00:11:48,838 --> 00:11:50,338
That's a Soldado sign.

306
00:11:50,362 --> 00:11:51,861
The Soldados and the Tigers
have a very ugly history

307
00:11:51,885 --> 00:11:53,297
of territory beefs.

308
00:11:53,321 --> 00:11:54,603
Yeah, which means
Speed Racer and his homies

309
00:11:54,627 --> 00:11:56,081
shouldn't be anywhere near
that part of town.

310
00:11:56,105 --> 00:11:57,836
Maybe that's why he was in such a hurry.

311
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:59,918
The timestamp's two minutes
after the first 911 call.

312
00:11:59,942 --> 00:12:01,392
Could be our shooters making a getaway.

313
00:12:01,416 --> 00:12:04,158
Yeah, I'll run the plate
and get it to Hondo.

314
00:12:06,943 --> 00:12:08,356
These gang notes are intense, man.

315
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:10,032
Your team really tracks it all.

316
00:12:10,667 --> 00:12:12,034
Friendships, breakups.

317
00:12:12,507 --> 00:12:14,255
Favorite fast food. Damn.

318
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:17,943
Hey, I got to ask.

319
00:12:17,967 --> 00:12:20,119
Your team feels super tight.

320
00:12:20,143 --> 00:12:22,644
How do you feel safe with that
new chick watching your six?

321
00:12:22,668 --> 00:12:25,458
- You mean Gamble?
- Gamble, huh?

322
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:29,065
She must be using a fake name
or something.

323
00:12:29,892 --> 00:12:31,806
You really don't know who she is?

324
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,503
Don't know what?

325
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,482
Gamble's got a history.

326
00:12:35,506 --> 00:12:37,833
Her dad ran his own
little corner of L.A.

327
00:12:37,857 --> 00:12:40,313
Had a nice racket
until his luck ran out.

328
00:12:40,337 --> 00:12:42,315
Got caught robbing a warehouse.

329
00:12:42,339 --> 00:12:44,385
Killed the responding officer.

330
00:12:45,081 --> 00:12:46,822
Sheriff's deputy.

331
00:12:49,912 --> 00:12:51,739
Gamble couldn't have had
anything to do with that.

332
00:12:52,338 --> 00:12:54,676
You sure?
Her whole family's in the life.

333
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:57,635
Got a fat file with their name
on it somewhere around here.

334
00:12:57,659 --> 00:13:01,117
And... she still hangs with them.

335
00:13:01,141 --> 00:13:03,293
Was with them all weekend.

336
00:13:03,317 --> 00:13:04,839
How the hell do you know that?

337
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:07,253
Guys in the department
have kept an eye on her

338
00:13:07,277 --> 00:13:09,279
since she moved back.

339
00:13:10,106 --> 00:13:12,483
Her dad killed one of our own.

340
00:13:13,022 --> 00:13:14,370
We never forget,

341
00:13:14,611 --> 00:13:16,571
and we never forgive.

342
00:13:18,636 --> 00:13:21,638
It's a bad look, standing next
to a cop-killer's kid.

343
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:23,641
You should talk to your boss.

344
00:13:24,991 --> 00:13:27,926
She shouldn't be allowed
anywhere near a badge.

345
00:13:29,735 --> 00:13:32,061
Miko found a Soldado car caught
fleeing the scene last night.

346
00:13:32,085 --> 00:13:35,064
Car belongs to a Danny Parra,
19, lives in Huntington Park.

347
00:13:35,088 --> 00:13:37,022
We know the name.

348
00:13:37,046 --> 00:13:38,807
Danny's brother, Arturo?

349
00:13:38,831 --> 00:13:40,504
He runs the Soldado crew.

350
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:42,288
Of the stash houses hit,

351
00:13:42,312 --> 00:13:44,029
none have belonged to the Soldados.

352
00:13:44,053 --> 00:13:45,532
That's awful convenient, isn't it?

353
00:13:45,808 --> 00:13:47,772
Maybe you've been overthinking this.

354
00:13:47,796 --> 00:13:49,469
The Soldados could just be making a play

355
00:13:49,493 --> 00:13:51,277
for the big leagues,
taking out their competition.

356
00:13:51,606 --> 00:13:53,524
There's only one way to find out.

357
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:57,153
Knock and ask, our specialty.

358
00:13:59,852 --> 00:14:01,699
The Soldados don't play, Hondo.

359
00:14:01,723 --> 00:14:04,615
We've got three open murders
tied to their top lieutenants alone.

360
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,356
If they are the ones
behind these stash house hits...

361
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:08,053
They're not going
to like us crashing their party.

362
00:14:08,077 --> 00:14:10,708
Well, it's a good thing
that never stopped us before.

363
00:14:10,732 --> 00:14:11,993
Right on.

364
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:14,625
Yo. If SWAT's really
the best of the best,

365
00:14:14,649 --> 00:14:17,062
why do you need all that crap
on your belt, huh?

366
00:14:17,086 --> 00:14:18,237
Do you want to borrow my spare?

367
00:14:18,261 --> 00:14:19,543
If you suck in that gut,

368
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:20,979
you might be able to squeeze into it.

369
00:14:21,003 --> 00:14:23,590
Wow. No, thanks.

370
00:14:23,614 --> 00:14:26,506
No need to lug around
an entire medicine cabinet.

371
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:28,291
Does it make you jealous
that even with 20 pounds

372
00:14:28,315 --> 00:14:29,683
of gear around my waist,

373
00:14:29,707 --> 00:14:31,207
I'll still smoke your ass
in a foot race?

374
00:14:32,449 --> 00:14:33,798
Hey, by the way, Gamble?

375
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:36,657
This patch? It means
we're the good guys.

376
00:14:36,681 --> 00:14:38,803
Try not to shoot us in the back, yeah?

377
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:40,408
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

378
00:14:40,433 --> 00:14:42,435
Just walk away, Gamble.

379
00:14:44,679 --> 00:14:46,201
Careful, Tan.

380
00:14:46,608 --> 00:14:48,219
She'll come for you next.

381
00:14:51,991 --> 00:14:53,644
Deac's back from recon.

382
00:14:55,342 --> 00:14:58,495
We spotted both Danny,
and Arturo Parra inside the house.

383
00:14:58,519 --> 00:15:00,279
Hard to tell how many Soldados
are in there with them.

384
00:15:00,303 --> 00:15:01,604
How secure are the premises?

385
00:15:01,628 --> 00:15:03,848
Reinforced iron bars,
doors and windows, all sides.

386
00:15:03,872 --> 00:15:06,851
Alfaro and I could make a covert
approach, use the laser cutter

387
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:08,157
on the bars on the front.

388
00:15:08,181 --> 00:15:09,506
SWAT's way might work
when you've got time

389
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:11,116
to sit with your hands in your pocket,

390
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:12,988
but we can't waste another
second stopping these guys.

391
00:15:13,012 --> 00:15:14,032
What's your play, then?

392
00:15:14,056 --> 00:15:15,883
We go in GSU-style.

393
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:20,193
Only our laser cutter has
300 horsies under the hood.

394
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:47,326
Deacon, flashbang.

395
00:15:50,963 --> 00:15:52,810
Turn around! Turn around!

396
00:15:52,834 --> 00:15:54,638
Move! On the ground! Freeze!

397
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:55,857
Show me your hands.

398
00:15:55,881 --> 00:15:57,752
Show me your hands, Arturo!

399
00:15:58,579 --> 00:16:00,860
Got a runner, headed toward the back.

400
00:16:03,932 --> 00:16:05,040
Mine!

401
00:16:05,064 --> 00:16:06,866
Damn it! Gamble, stick close.

402
00:16:08,151 --> 00:16:09,849
Tan, hold up!

403
00:16:13,942 --> 00:16:16,075
Duck!

404
00:16:18,258 --> 00:16:19,955
We're clear in the back.

405
00:16:20,755 --> 00:16:23,188
One casualty. It's Danny Parra, sir.

406
00:16:23,212 --> 00:16:25,016
What the hell happened?

407
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,496
Parra popped out of the closet,

408
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,019
ready to ice your boy Tan.

409
00:16:28,043 --> 00:16:30,152
It's a good thing I was
clearing back here already.

410
00:16:30,176 --> 00:16:31,658
I was trying to catch up to you, Lang.

411
00:16:31,683 --> 00:16:33,206
SWAT moves as a pack.

412
00:16:33,231 --> 00:16:36,437
Yeah. Tell that to your teammate
you left in the dust.

413
00:16:44,222 --> 00:16:45,532
You got to say something, Arturo.

414
00:16:45,556 --> 00:16:47,352
We're gonna make assumptions.

415
00:16:47,376 --> 00:16:50,579
We found guns, money
and product at your place.

416
00:16:50,603 --> 00:16:51,952
Those things are a luxury to crews

417
00:16:51,976 --> 00:16:54,312
in your part of town right now, man.

418
00:16:54,336 --> 00:16:55,754
You talk to all your suspects

419
00:16:55,778 --> 00:16:57,834
like you're having them
over for Sunday supper?

420
00:16:59,973 --> 00:17:02,104
When was the last time
you saw your mama, Arturo?

421
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:03,815
Sara, right?

422
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,215
Over on Cottage Street?

423
00:17:05,239 --> 00:17:06,544
Red mailbox?

424
00:17:06,884 --> 00:17:08,697
When I leave this room, I am going to go

425
00:17:08,721 --> 00:17:10,351
to her house and arrest her

426
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:12,245
for associating with a gang member,

427
00:17:13,223 --> 00:17:15,027
stick her in County

428
00:17:15,051 --> 00:17:17,241
with all the addicts and the working
girls they brought in last night,

429
00:17:17,265 --> 00:17:19,017
let her lawyer sort it out.

430
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:20,857
Might take a few days.

431
00:17:22,191 --> 00:17:24,762
You have an auntie
who lives next door, yeah?

432
00:17:24,786 --> 00:17:26,764
Might just grab her, too.

433
00:17:26,788 --> 00:17:28,635
There's room in our car.

434
00:17:28,659 --> 00:17:31,507
I don't know anything
about those robberies.

435
00:17:31,531 --> 00:17:34,036
The Soldados had nothing
to do with them.

436
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:38,124
Explain the guns, then.

437
00:17:38,312 --> 00:17:39,791
Protection.

438
00:17:39,816 --> 00:17:41,513
Everyone knows what's been going down.

439
00:17:41,538 --> 00:17:43,016
We all think we're next.

440
00:17:43,068 --> 00:17:45,374
- We armed up, just in case.
- You're lying.

441
00:17:45,589 --> 00:17:47,610
Your brother was
at the Tiger hit last night,

442
00:17:47,634 --> 00:17:48,655
along with someone else.

443
00:17:48,679 --> 00:17:50,004
We have video.

444
00:17:50,028 --> 00:17:52,006
I don't know what Danny was doing there.

445
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:53,529
- He's not like that.
- Yes, he is.

446
00:17:53,553 --> 00:17:56,097
He just tried to jump a SWAT officer.

447
00:17:56,121 --> 00:17:58,983
Who else was in the car with Danny?

448
00:17:59,007 --> 00:18:00,056
Tell me,

449
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,495
or he won't be the only family
member you never see again.

450
00:18:02,519 --> 00:18:04,956
All right, Vignisson,
chill out, that's enough.

451
00:18:07,072 --> 00:18:08,812
What did you mean,
Danny wasn't like that?

452
00:18:08,837 --> 00:18:10,490
Danny wasn't a Soldado?

453
00:18:10,907 --> 00:18:13,898
He liked the cars, making stupid videos.

454
00:18:13,922 --> 00:18:15,536
He never rolled for real.

455
00:18:16,731 --> 00:18:18,819
I don't know what
he was doing there that night,

456
00:18:18,927 --> 00:18:20,958
but it wasn't Soldado business.

457
00:18:22,495 --> 00:18:24,149
He was just a kid.

458
00:18:27,829 --> 00:18:29,394
Tell me we found something useful

459
00:18:29,419 --> 00:18:31,072
in that raid of Arturo Parra's house.

460
00:18:31,156 --> 00:18:32,612
Hell of a lot of heroin,

461
00:18:32,636 --> 00:18:34,238
but that's the Soldado stock and trade.

462
00:18:34,263 --> 00:18:35,786
Didn't find anything that ties back

463
00:18:35,811 --> 00:18:37,159
to any of the stash house robberies.

464
00:18:37,184 --> 00:18:39,054
After four hits, this
crew must be sitting

465
00:18:39,079 --> 00:18:40,471
on a mountain of stolen product.

466
00:18:40,496 --> 00:18:41,931
We know they haven't tried
to resell it in L.A.

467
00:18:41,956 --> 00:18:43,261
We would have traced it by now.

468
00:18:43,299 --> 00:18:44,667
Yeah, but why would
they be sitting on it?

469
00:18:44,691 --> 00:18:45,699
That doesn't make any sense.

470
00:18:45,723 --> 00:18:47,735
What if their motive had nothing
to do with drugs at all?

471
00:18:48,021 --> 00:18:50,240
Ballistics just came back.
Got a ping from a shell casing

472
00:18:50,265 --> 00:18:52,089
from the gun used to kill
the mother next door.

473
00:18:52,184 --> 00:18:53,837
That's a match to a gun
belonging to John Flynn.

474
00:18:53,862 --> 00:18:55,210
He's a Compton local.

475
00:18:55,267 --> 00:18:56,549
Flynn owns an auto shop

476
00:18:56,573 --> 00:18:57,695
that was robbed a couple years ago.

477
00:18:57,719 --> 00:18:59,343
He used his own gun to defend the store.

478
00:18:59,367 --> 00:19:01,607
That's how it got in our system.
After that, he became

479
00:19:01,631 --> 00:19:03,086
a vocal anti-gang advocate.

480
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:05,272
Neighborhood watches, city petitions.

481
00:19:05,296 --> 00:19:07,395
You think this is some kind
of take-back-the-neighborhood

482
00:19:07,419 --> 00:19:08,483
vigilante movement?

483
00:19:08,507 --> 00:19:09,810
How does Danny Parra fit in?

484
00:19:09,834 --> 00:19:11,747
We still don't know what he was
doing in Tiger turf last night.

485
00:19:11,771 --> 00:19:13,270
Impound is bringing Danny's car in now.

486
00:19:13,294 --> 00:19:14,881
Maybe there's something in it
that can tell us.

487
00:19:14,905 --> 00:19:16,926
Alfaro, grab Hondo
and pay Flynn a visit.

488
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:18,450
Deacon, stay with the Parra car.

489
00:19:18,474 --> 00:19:21,564
Something tells me this kid's
wrapped up in all of this.

490
00:19:24,349 --> 00:19:27,270
So, some LASD jerk talks
sideways to your teammate,

491
00:19:27,294 --> 00:19:28,747
and you've got nothing to say?

492
00:19:28,771 --> 00:19:31,463
Guess both of us have been quiet
about a lot of things... Gamble.

493
00:19:31,487 --> 00:19:32,768
Gamble is my mother's name.

494
00:19:32,792 --> 00:19:34,596
And I'm not hiding from my past.

495
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:36,772
I was waiting for the right time
to tell the team.

496
00:19:36,796 --> 00:19:38,207
Well...

497
00:19:39,954 --> 00:19:41,584
...got my attention now.

498
00:19:42,957 --> 00:19:45,781
I never wanted anything
to do with my father's life.

499
00:19:45,805 --> 00:19:47,348
It's the whole reason
why I became a cop...

500
00:19:47,372 --> 00:19:48,654
just to prove him wrong.

501
00:19:48,678 --> 00:19:50,525
The second I got my badge, I said

502
00:19:50,549 --> 00:19:53,725
if I saw anything illegal,
I'd personally haul him in.

503
00:19:54,212 --> 00:19:56,137
That didn't stop him, though, did it?

504
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,752
No. It didn't.

505
00:19:59,776 --> 00:20:01,899
And it caught up to him in the end.

506
00:20:01,923 --> 00:20:03,107
Nearly destroyed my life,

507
00:20:03,131 --> 00:20:05,869
my entire family's life in the process.

508
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,655
- Does Hondo know?
- Of course.

509
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:12,895
He got me the slot with Oakland
P.D. after the shooting.

510
00:20:12,919 --> 00:20:14,244
He saw all this coming.

511
00:20:14,268 --> 00:20:16,496
The stares, suspicions, the threats.

512
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,771
I meant, does Hondo know you're
still in touch with your family.

513
00:20:18,795 --> 00:20:21,101
I know you saw 'em this weekend.

514
00:20:23,748 --> 00:20:26,039
It's been ten years since
I've seen my mom in person.

515
00:20:26,063 --> 00:20:27,693
I actually got to hug her
on her birthday.

516
00:20:27,717 --> 00:20:29,413
I do not regret that.

517
00:20:29,725 --> 00:20:32,292
I get hiding what your dad did.
That wasn't your fault.

518
00:20:32,631 --> 00:20:34,401
But if you're still associating
with criminals...

519
00:20:34,425 --> 00:20:36,645
They're still my family, Tan.

520
00:20:38,081 --> 00:20:40,301
I'm sorry you found out this way.

521
00:20:41,084 --> 00:20:43,042
I wasn't ready to tell the team,

522
00:20:43,217 --> 00:20:44,716
but after seeing you

523
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:47,632
side with some guy you just met over me,

524
00:20:47,656 --> 00:20:49,286
and for some bro points,

525
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:51,399
maybe I was right to wait.

526
00:20:55,496 --> 00:20:58,469
Dobes! They got you doing delivery?

527
00:20:58,493 --> 00:21:00,384
Sometimes that's the job.

528
00:21:00,408 --> 00:21:02,560
- Can you sign these impound papers?
- Sure.

529
00:21:02,584 --> 00:21:05,369
Do you want to stay,
check the car out with us?

530
00:21:06,153 --> 00:21:08,502
I'm good. Thanks.

531
00:21:08,626 --> 00:21:10,044
Hey, Dobes.

532
00:21:11,003 --> 00:21:13,136
You were cold this morning, but
now you're practically subzero.

533
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,988
What the hell's going on?

534
00:21:16,032 --> 00:21:17,618
Come on, Deac.

535
00:21:17,642 --> 00:21:19,664
We're too old to be
dredging up ancient history.

536
00:21:19,688 --> 00:21:23,077
Let's just leave the past in the
past and get back to our own lives.

537
00:21:23,101 --> 00:21:25,626
What are you talking about?
We were each other's first partner.

538
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:27,522
There's no way
I'm turning my back on that.

539
00:21:29,567 --> 00:21:31,806
Then why haven't I heard
from you in 20 years?

540
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:33,373
We were best friends, man.

541
00:21:33,397 --> 00:21:34,679
Deacon and Dobes.

542
00:21:34,703 --> 00:21:37,464
And then you made SWAT and poof.
You disappeared.

543
00:21:37,488 --> 00:21:41,207
Look, those first
few months were very intense.

544
00:21:41,231 --> 00:21:42,948
I had to prove that I belonged here.

545
00:21:42,972 --> 00:21:44,338
You know how bad I wanted SWAT.

546
00:21:44,362 --> 00:21:45,820
We wanted it.

547
00:21:45,844 --> 00:21:47,368
SWAT was my dream, too.

548
00:21:48,673 --> 00:21:51,565
I mean, it didn't feel good
not making the cut,

549
00:21:51,589 --> 00:21:54,612
but it felt worse
going back to the beat alone.

550
00:21:54,636 --> 00:21:58,268
I... Every day,
the dream got further away.

551
00:21:58,292 --> 00:22:00,183
I needed my partner,

552
00:22:00,207 --> 00:22:01,599
and you never reached out.

553
00:22:02,905 --> 00:22:04,013
Guess you were too busy for me.

554
00:22:04,037 --> 00:22:05,449
- Oh, come on.
- I mean, admit it.

555
00:22:05,473 --> 00:22:07,973
You moved on to-to bigger things.

556
00:22:07,997 --> 00:22:10,628
You didn't have time for some
patrol cop as a friend anymore.

557
00:22:10,652 --> 00:22:12,021
No, that's ridiculous.

558
00:22:12,045 --> 00:22:14,719
I didn't think I was bigger than anyone.

559
00:22:14,743 --> 00:22:16,851
Yes, SWAT took up a lot of my time.

560
00:22:16,875 --> 00:22:17,983
I also got married.

561
00:22:18,007 --> 00:22:19,442
I had children.

562
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:21,349
Dobes, it's called getting older.

563
00:22:21,373 --> 00:22:22,969
Everyone gets older.

564
00:22:22,993 --> 00:22:26,233
Most find a way to keep in touch
with people they care about.

565
00:22:27,103 --> 00:22:29,647
I'm... I'm over it, really.

566
00:22:29,671 --> 00:22:31,866
I made real friends in the LASD.

567
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:33,669
Vignisson, the rest of the guys,

568
00:22:34,284 --> 00:22:36,306
they pulled me out of my spiral,

569
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:38,257
got me motivated again.

570
00:22:38,897 --> 00:22:40,595
They're real family.

571
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:44,227
All good, Deac?

572
00:22:44,251 --> 00:22:46,993
- Yeah.
- Who was that guy?

573
00:22:48,429 --> 00:22:50,352
Just someone I used to work with.

574
00:22:52,915 --> 00:22:54,655
So, did you find anything
that might explain

575
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:57,377
why Danny was racing through
Tiger territory last night?

576
00:22:57,568 --> 00:23:00,025
How about hair ties and some lipstick?

577
00:23:00,049 --> 00:23:03,028
Look like something that a
19-year-old boy would have?

578
00:23:03,052 --> 00:23:04,203
Danny doesn't have a sister.

579
00:23:04,227 --> 00:23:07,622
And his brother didn't mention
anything about a girlfriend, either.

580
00:23:08,927 --> 00:23:11,452
Maybe because Danny didn't want
his brother to know.

581
00:23:12,570 --> 00:23:14,877
She look like someone a Soldado
should be dating?

582
00:23:16,935 --> 00:23:18,783
This girl's name is Emma Roddy.

583
00:23:18,807 --> 00:23:21,220
She's a straight-A senior
at Compton High School.

584
00:23:21,244 --> 00:23:23,437
Her brother was one of the
Tigers who was killed last night.

585
00:23:23,461 --> 00:23:25,572
She lives in the stash house
that was hit.

586
00:23:25,596 --> 00:23:27,096
We couldn't find
Danny's phone at the raid,

587
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,662
but we were able to get
a warrant for its data.

588
00:23:28,686 --> 00:23:30,055
We found secret messages

589
00:23:30,079 --> 00:23:32,014
between Danny and Emma.
They were dating.

590
00:23:32,038 --> 00:23:33,711
Star-crossed lovers from rival sets?

591
00:23:33,735 --> 00:23:35,452
- No wonder they kept it a secret.
- Well, there's more.

592
00:23:35,476 --> 00:23:37,781
Emma texted Danny while
the robbery was going down.

593
00:23:38,067 --> 00:23:41,110
Danny says,
"Go hide," that he's "on his way."

594
00:23:41,134 --> 00:23:44,069
Wait.
Emma was the other person in Danny's car

595
00:23:44,093 --> 00:23:45,699
at the red light camera.

596
00:23:46,226 --> 00:23:48,030
He was picking her up after the robbery.

597
00:23:48,054 --> 00:23:49,118
That makes Emma the only witness

598
00:23:49,142 --> 00:23:50,510
to survive one of these attacks.

599
00:23:50,534 --> 00:23:52,077
All right, we already put out a BOLO.

600
00:23:52,101 --> 00:23:55,254
- We have to find her.
- Deac. Tan.

601
00:23:55,278 --> 00:23:56,777
We got to talk to the commander, now.

602
00:23:56,801 --> 00:23:58,759
What's going on?
Something happen at Flynn's auto shop?

603
00:23:58,783 --> 00:24:00,912
Not hardly.
That guy's done a spiritual 180

604
00:24:00,936 --> 00:24:02,087
in the past few years.

605
00:24:02,111 --> 00:24:03,595
He's all namaste, wouldn't hurt a fly.

606
00:24:03,619 --> 00:24:05,612
We asked about the gun used
in the Compton Tiger robbery.

607
00:24:05,636 --> 00:24:07,136
Flynn said he got rid
of it last Christmas.

608
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,789
Part of his new outlook.

609
00:24:08,813 --> 00:24:10,527
So that gun could be in
anyone's possession right now.

610
00:24:10,551 --> 00:24:12,924
No. Flynn said he traded
the gun in at a police buyback.

611
00:24:12,948 --> 00:24:14,534
The hell? To which station?

612
00:24:14,558 --> 00:24:16,275
South Central Sheriff's Department.

613
00:24:16,299 --> 00:24:18,812
I checked the records, and
the officer running the buyback:

614
00:24:18,836 --> 00:24:21,348
Lieutenant Raul Vignisson.

615
00:24:23,393 --> 00:24:26,155
What exactly are you accusing
these deputies of, Hondo?

616
00:24:26,179 --> 00:24:28,200
Sir, think about the group
we've been chasing.

617
00:24:28,224 --> 00:24:30,159
Enough skill to storm
fully-armed houses,

618
00:24:30,183 --> 00:24:31,812
enough intel to find them,

619
00:24:31,836 --> 00:24:33,858
and enough insight to avoid
leaving any evidence behind.

620
00:24:33,882 --> 00:24:35,740
This is a list.

621
00:24:35,764 --> 00:24:37,470
The GSU arrests in the last month.

622
00:24:37,494 --> 00:24:40,647
The night before each
gang stash house robbery,

623
00:24:40,671 --> 00:24:43,128
Vignisson's teamhauls in
a street-level dealer

624
00:24:43,152 --> 00:24:44,390
from the same gang.

625
00:24:44,414 --> 00:24:46,131
It could be how they pick their targets.

626
00:24:46,155 --> 00:24:48,394
Bust a small fish,
get the location of the stash.

627
00:24:48,418 --> 00:24:49,482
Commander,

628
00:24:49,506 --> 00:24:52,006
the GSU are the stash house robbers.

629
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:54,618
It explains why
they never leave a witness alive.

630
00:24:54,642 --> 00:24:57,595
No matter how well you hide your face,
a cop still moves like a cop.

631
00:24:57,619 --> 00:24:58,926
And it can't be lost on you, sir.

632
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:00,537
The only body that dropped today

633
00:25:00,561 --> 00:25:02,974
was been a potential witness
SWAT discovered on our own.

634
00:25:02,998 --> 00:25:04,758
- Danny Parra.
- That's right.

635
00:25:04,782 --> 00:25:07,239
Tan, I need you to think very carefully.

636
00:25:07,263 --> 00:25:10,024
Did you see a gun on Danny Parra
during the raid?

637
00:25:10,048 --> 00:25:12,331
I... I didn't really see Danny.

638
00:25:12,355 --> 00:25:14,159
He came at me from behind.
Lang took the shot.

639
00:25:14,183 --> 00:25:16,161
But afterward. The weapon.

640
00:25:16,185 --> 00:25:19,318
Lang went right to the body,
kicked the gun away.

641
00:25:20,252 --> 00:25:22,409
He could've planted it.
I wouldn't have known.

642
00:25:24,006 --> 00:25:25,866
Wait a minute.
Danny wasn't the only witness

643
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:27,259
at the Tiger house robbery.

644
00:25:27,283 --> 00:25:29,348
No, his girlfriend, Emma.
We've got a BOLO out.

645
00:25:29,372 --> 00:25:31,045
It won't take long for Vignisson

646
00:25:31,069 --> 00:25:32,399
to figure out why we're looking for her.

647
00:25:32,423 --> 00:25:33,874
Well, we need to find her first.

648
00:25:33,898 --> 00:25:36,181
Well, Danny probably took her
somewhere safe to lay low,

649
00:25:36,205 --> 00:25:37,443
somewhere not connected to the streets.

650
00:25:37,467 --> 00:25:39,053
Powell went through her social media.

651
00:25:39,077 --> 00:25:40,533
She's got an aunt
who lives down in Torrance.

652
00:25:40,557 --> 00:25:42,100
Well, that's our best shot.
Get down there now.

653
00:25:42,124 --> 00:25:45,562
If we figuredit out,
you can bet Vignisson will, too.

654
00:25:57,531 --> 00:26:00,621
This is LAPD!
We're looking for Elsa Roddy.

655
00:26:01,709 --> 00:26:03,991
Officers, good Lord.
What's this all about?

656
00:26:04,015 --> 00:26:05,210
Ma'am, we're looking
for your niece, Emma.

657
00:26:05,234 --> 00:26:06,408
Have you seen her in the last 24 hours?

658
00:26:07,441 --> 00:26:09,954
She showed up here this
morning looking scared.

659
00:26:09,978 --> 00:26:12,174
I wish she would move out
that horrible house

660
00:26:12,198 --> 00:26:13,218
and get away from her brother.

661
00:26:13,242 --> 00:26:14,785
We need to speak to her, ma'am.

662
00:26:14,809 --> 00:26:17,222
I'm sorry.
Her boyfriend Danny texted her.

663
00:26:17,246 --> 00:26:20,878
Asked her to meet him
at a park by her house.

664
00:26:20,902 --> 00:26:22,522
She left about 20 minutes ago.

665
00:26:22,546 --> 00:26:24,273
Thank you for your time.

666
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:29,103
The GSU must've pocketed Danny's phone.
They sent that message to Emma.

667
00:26:29,127 --> 00:26:31,106
Which means she's headed
straight to them right now.

668
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:32,611
Let's go.

669
00:26:38,038 --> 00:26:39,897
Patrol just arrived at the park
by Emma's house.

670
00:26:39,921 --> 00:26:41,115
No sign of her.

671
00:26:41,139 --> 00:26:42,508
All right, we got to find Vignisson

672
00:26:42,532 --> 00:26:44,141
and get him to come back to HQ
without a scene.

673
00:26:44,628 --> 00:26:47,216
Find me? I'm right here.

674
00:26:47,816 --> 00:26:49,263
SWAT catch a break in the case?

675
00:26:49,287 --> 00:26:52,865
Where's the girl,
Vignisson? Where's Emma Roddy?

676
00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:54,383
I have no idea who that is.

677
00:26:54,407 --> 00:26:56,342
Drop the act. We know everything.

678
00:26:56,366 --> 00:26:59,040
Oh. That's a relief.

679
00:26:59,064 --> 00:27:01,632
Felt like you were chasing your tails.

680
00:27:03,227 --> 00:27:04,753
Where's the rest of your team?

681
00:27:05,274 --> 00:27:07,614
Following a lead.
But it must be a dead end,

682
00:27:07,638 --> 00:27:09,442
seeing as you already
solved this, right?

683
00:27:09,466 --> 00:27:10,704
How about you call them into SWAT HQ?

684
00:27:10,728 --> 00:27:12,120
We could talk about it more there.

685
00:27:12,656 --> 00:27:14,296
My men don't answer to you.

686
00:27:14,644 --> 00:27:16,298
And neither do I.

687
00:27:18,475 --> 00:27:20,758
This is your one chance
to end things cleanly.

688
00:27:20,782 --> 00:27:22,411
You tell us where Emma Roddy is,
and you turn yourself in,

689
00:27:22,435 --> 00:27:24,959
or I promise you, we will
hunt your whole team down.

690
00:27:26,003 --> 00:27:27,613
I don't know where she is, Hondo,

691
00:27:28,672 --> 00:27:31,029
but girls like that
run away all the time.

692
00:27:31,053 --> 00:27:33,135
Sometimes very far away.

693
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:35,881
And they're never heard from again.

694
00:27:43,413 --> 00:27:44,849
Good luck with the search.

695
00:27:51,334 --> 00:27:53,614
Hey. Give me a second.

696
00:27:54,119 --> 00:27:55,773
I'll meet you at the car.

697
00:27:59,174 --> 00:28:00,387
Did you know?

698
00:28:00,412 --> 00:28:02,147
Did you know what
Vignisson's crew was up to?

699
00:28:02,171 --> 00:28:03,452
What are you talking about?

700
00:28:03,476 --> 00:28:06,214
Oh, come on. The GSU. They're
the ones robbing the stash houses

701
00:28:06,238 --> 00:28:08,117
and murdering people to cover it up.

702
00:28:08,141 --> 00:28:10,242
What kind of cop says that
about other cops? Disgraceful.

703
00:28:10,266 --> 00:28:12,461
- Did you know?
- I don't know what kind of

704
00:28:12,485 --> 00:28:13,724
messed-up head game this is,

705
00:28:13,748 --> 00:28:15,073
but Vignisson is like a brother to me.

706
00:28:15,097 --> 00:28:16,204
You're talking about my family.

707
00:28:16,228 --> 00:28:17,249
For God's sakes, Dobes,

708
00:28:17,273 --> 00:28:18,598
he doesn't care about you.

709
00:28:18,622 --> 00:28:20,382
His team is a bunch of thugs.

710
00:28:20,406 --> 00:28:21,819
He just dangles that open slot

711
00:28:21,843 --> 00:28:24,299
to surround his guys
with gullible deputies

712
00:28:24,323 --> 00:28:25,518
desperate for his attention.

713
00:28:25,542 --> 00:28:27,804
You are never gonna make GSU.

714
00:28:28,774 --> 00:28:31,895
Just like I never could
make SWAT, right?

715
00:28:32,976 --> 00:28:35,814
Guess I was right about the way
you looked at me all these years.

716
00:28:36,787 --> 00:28:39,181
Yeah. Yeah, you're right.

717
00:28:40,577 --> 00:28:42,100
You remember how we used to

718
00:28:42,124 --> 00:28:44,232
look at the SWAT guys?

719
00:28:44,256 --> 00:28:46,278
Like they walked on water.

720
00:28:46,302 --> 00:28:48,210
When I finally got in,

721
00:28:49,461 --> 00:28:50,871
maybe I let that go to my head.

722
00:28:51,505 --> 00:28:54,286
I thought I was better
than everybody else,

723
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:56,050
including you.

724
00:28:56,725 --> 00:28:58,179
I'm sorry.

725
00:29:00,142 --> 00:29:01,641
Back at Wilshire,

726
00:29:01,665 --> 00:29:03,971
I hated how we used to always
try to outdo each other.

727
00:29:04,309 --> 00:29:07,062
I mean, I always just trying
to keep up with you, but you...

728
00:29:07,845 --> 00:29:08,779
you wanted to win.

729
00:29:08,803 --> 00:29:10,482
I just wanted to be the best,

730
00:29:11,358 --> 00:29:13,589
to stand out, and I still do.

731
00:29:13,777 --> 00:29:16,505
And sometimes, I hate myself for it.

732
00:29:16,864 --> 00:29:18,223
I wasted a long time being bitter

733
00:29:18,247 --> 00:29:19,833
when I didn't make team leader.

734
00:29:19,857 --> 00:29:21,553
Even now,

735
00:29:21,827 --> 00:29:24,556
I can't handle someone else
running SWAT Academy.

736
00:29:24,997 --> 00:29:27,058
You retired and came back, Deac.

737
00:29:27,082 --> 00:29:28,537
You still get to be SWAT.

738
00:29:28,561 --> 00:29:30,389
Don't you realize what a gift that is?

739
00:29:32,217 --> 00:29:33,696
Dobes.

740
00:29:34,089 --> 00:29:35,611
I'm not here as your friend.

741
00:29:36,049 --> 00:29:39,157
The GSU, they are holding
a young girl hostage,

742
00:29:39,181 --> 00:29:41,444
and we need to find her, please.

743
00:29:42,706 --> 00:29:44,423
They're such a tight group, Deac.

744
00:29:44,447 --> 00:29:45,728
They don't share much with anyone.

745
00:29:45,752 --> 00:29:47,580
Well, anything,
anything could be helpful.

746
00:29:48,494 --> 00:29:49,863
I overheard Lang

747
00:29:49,887 --> 00:29:51,299
mention a place out by Diamond Bar

748
00:29:51,323 --> 00:29:52,387
where they "shoot tin cans."

749
00:29:52,411 --> 00:29:54,196
I... I never understood that.

750
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:55,564
We got a range here at the station.

751
00:29:55,588 --> 00:29:58,219
Okay. Well, that-that's something.

752
00:29:58,243 --> 00:29:59,984
I'll run it by my team.

753
00:30:02,045 --> 00:30:03,786
Thank you for trusting me.

754
00:30:07,998 --> 00:30:11,015
Vignisson's playing dumb, but
he knows we're coming for him.

755
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:12,843
Rest of his team's MIA.

756
00:30:12,867 --> 00:30:15,889
They're probably destroying anything
that ties them to the robberies,

757
00:30:15,913 --> 00:30:18,022
but that's all hearsay unless
we find physical evidence.

758
00:30:18,046 --> 00:30:20,067
- Yup.
- What's that mean for Emma?

759
00:30:20,091 --> 00:30:21,503
They'll need to find out if she's talked

760
00:30:21,527 --> 00:30:23,072
to anyone else, any last loose ends.

761
00:30:23,096 --> 00:30:24,419
After that...

762
00:30:24,443 --> 00:30:25,812
We'll find her.

763
00:30:25,836 --> 00:30:27,814
We never found their stolen stash.

764
00:30:27,838 --> 00:30:30,730
If their hideout is safe enough,
for all that money and drugs,

765
00:30:30,754 --> 00:30:32,601
then it's safe enough
to hold and question Emma.

766
00:30:32,625 --> 00:30:34,952
Deacon's old partner heard the GSU guys

767
00:30:34,976 --> 00:30:37,911
talking about shooting
tin cans in Diamond Bar.

768
00:30:37,935 --> 00:30:41,175
I remember competing in
an LASD shooting competition

769
00:30:41,199 --> 00:30:42,655
back when I was a deputy.

770
00:30:42,679 --> 00:30:45,179
It was at this old
building-turned-shoot house

771
00:30:45,203 --> 00:30:47,355
out in Diamond Bar.

772
00:30:47,379 --> 00:30:49,314
Check out who hosted the event.

773
00:30:49,338 --> 00:30:51,488
Vignisson. This is the place.

774
00:30:51,512 --> 00:30:54,188
Tan, fire up Black Betty.
I'll reroute Hondo and Deacon.

775
00:30:54,212 --> 00:30:56,625
What about Vignisson? He's still
at the sheriff's station.

776
00:30:56,649 --> 00:30:58,521
You leave him to me.

777
00:31:02,612 --> 00:31:05,069
Come on, sweetheart. We need to know

778
00:31:05,093 --> 00:31:06,548
where you ran off to that night.

779
00:31:06,572 --> 00:31:10,359
Who else did you talk to
besides your boyfriend, Danny?

780
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:15,226
Vigs said torch it all.

781
00:31:18,671 --> 00:31:20,815
That's a cool mil, up in flames.

782
00:31:20,839 --> 00:31:23,153
Plenty more where that came from
when this all blows over.

783
00:31:23,354 --> 00:31:24,702
Look at me!

784
00:31:24,866 --> 00:31:26,765
You know what's gonna happen here,

785
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,985
so tell us who you talked to.

786
00:31:29,639 --> 00:31:32,424
We can end it this way,
or we can end it that way.

787
00:31:43,348 --> 00:31:45,370
What's the hurry, Lieutenant?

788
00:31:48,005 --> 00:31:49,354
Commander.

789
00:31:53,184 --> 00:31:54,663
What, you here to arrest me?

790
00:31:54,893 --> 00:31:56,372
I'll let Hondo have that honor

791
00:31:56,397 --> 00:31:58,833
when he returns with
the girl you kidnapped.

792
00:31:58,984 --> 00:32:01,339
I'm just here to make sure
you don't go anywhere.

793
00:32:01,636 --> 00:32:03,097
And I brought a couple
of black-and-whites with me,

794
00:32:03,122 --> 00:32:04,688
in case you get any funny ideas.

795
00:32:06,867 --> 00:32:09,829
Do you know why all the other
cops can't stand you SWAT guys?

796
00:32:09,853 --> 00:32:11,265
Hmm?

797
00:32:11,289 --> 00:32:14,248
It's this holier-than-thou schtick.

798
00:32:14,583 --> 00:32:16,575
The rest of us are out here
doing the best we can,

799
00:32:16,599 --> 00:32:17,880
trying to survive.

800
00:32:17,904 --> 00:32:19,534
Is that what you call theft and murder?

801
00:32:19,558 --> 00:32:22,102
We clean up the streets,
we stop the flow of drugs.

802
00:32:22,126 --> 00:32:24,084
We're just doing our jobs.

803
00:32:24,852 --> 00:32:27,095
I don't think you'll have one
for much longer.

804
00:32:28,285 --> 00:32:31,114
Let's wait to see
whose team makes it back.

805
00:32:33,442 --> 00:32:34,723
Looks like they're here.

806
00:32:34,747 --> 00:32:36,522
All right, our priority is Emma Roddy.

807
00:32:36,546 --> 00:32:38,479
She's an innocent caught up
in all of this.

808
00:32:38,504 --> 00:32:39,869
Now, they can try and hold us off,

809
00:32:39,894 --> 00:32:41,416
but we are not leaving here without her.

810
00:32:41,441 --> 00:32:43,941
These men will protect
their secret at all costs.

811
00:32:43,965 --> 00:32:45,290
They will shoot to kill.

812
00:32:45,314 --> 00:32:46,770
Now, they may not be acting like cops,

813
00:32:46,794 --> 00:32:47,918
but they're still trained like them.

814
00:32:47,942 --> 00:32:50,223
Probably protected
by the same gear we are, too.

815
00:32:50,247 --> 00:32:52,123
Only difference is, they play dirty.

816
00:32:52,147 --> 00:32:53,603
Hey, don't get it twisted.
They may have training,

817
00:32:53,627 --> 00:32:55,344
but they do not have
our training. They are not SWAT.

818
00:32:55,368 --> 00:32:57,564
Keep tight to your two,
heads on a swivel.

819
00:32:57,588 --> 00:32:59,807
Let's go. We're moving in.

820
00:33:04,087 --> 00:33:06,263
Niko, door.

821
00:33:14,017 --> 00:33:15,495
That's the motion sensors.

822
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:17,847
Ronnie, cover the fire.
Lang, hide the cash.

823
00:33:17,871 --> 00:33:19,696
- Then gear up.
- How are they here already?

824
00:33:20,176 --> 00:33:21,942
Doesn't matter.

825
00:33:24,049 --> 00:33:26,268
All that matters now
is they don't leave.

826
00:33:31,971 --> 00:33:33,320
Hold.

827
00:33:35,408 --> 00:33:36,409
Cover.

828
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,091
You know, I stayed out
of the trash talking all day,

829
00:33:47,115 --> 00:33:48,422
but now I gotta warn you.

830
00:33:48,446 --> 00:33:50,350
SWAT's about to run circles around you.

831
00:33:50,374 --> 00:33:52,488
Doubt it. Your toys won't save you here.

832
00:33:52,512 --> 00:33:53,861
You're in our house now.

833
00:34:01,507 --> 00:34:04,380
Hondo, visual. Suspect deep moving.

834
00:34:10,795 --> 00:34:12,883
- Damn it, I lost him.
- Does anybody have eyes?

835
00:34:12,908 --> 00:34:14,910
Cover, cover!

836
00:34:16,754 --> 00:34:17,861
We can't all stay
pinned down in this room

837
00:34:17,885 --> 00:34:19,515
or they're gonna pick us off.

838
00:34:19,539 --> 00:34:20,734
We've got to find Emma.

839
00:34:20,758 --> 00:34:23,238
20-Squad, break off in pairs! Move, now!

840
00:34:34,822 --> 00:34:36,721
25-David, found another training room.

841
00:34:36,746 --> 00:34:38,059
Checking it out.

842
00:34:41,474 --> 00:34:42,981
Damn it.

843
00:34:48,438 --> 00:34:50,439
Stay focused.

844
00:34:50,464 --> 00:34:52,032
Remember our training.

845
00:34:52,057 --> 00:34:53,928
This is just target practice.

846
00:35:11,983 --> 00:35:14,420
Stay down! Don't you move!

847
00:35:20,638 --> 00:35:22,901
How about this time we stick together?

848
00:35:36,248 --> 00:35:37,379
Gamble!

849
00:35:37,404 --> 00:35:38,882
Tan!

850
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:45,166
I'm so glad I get to be
the one to do this.

851
00:35:52,445 --> 00:35:53,707
Stay down!

852
00:35:54,047 --> 00:35:55,483
Honor's all yours, Gamble.

853
00:35:58,753 --> 00:36:00,406
Cover fire, Deac!

854
00:36:00,431 --> 00:36:01,649
We can't let them pin us down!

855
00:36:01,674 --> 00:36:04,312
We got to keep moving! On me.

856
00:36:09,527 --> 00:36:11,310
This guy's firing at us like a madman.

857
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:12,944
He thinks he's got us over a barrel.

858
00:36:12,969 --> 00:36:15,648
Then we got to take away his advantage.
Kill that confidence.

859
00:36:17,031 --> 00:36:18,641
If this shoot house
is anything like ours,

860
00:36:18,666 --> 00:36:21,103
there's a system control
for the instructor.

861
00:36:23,219 --> 00:36:24,958
There it is. Far wall.

862
00:36:24,983 --> 00:36:26,288
I'm on it. Cover me.

863
00:36:26,313 --> 00:36:27,619
Go!

864
00:36:41,294 --> 00:36:42,686
Drop it, now!

865
00:36:42,711 --> 00:36:45,847
Put it down! Put it down!

866
00:36:46,091 --> 00:36:47,396
On your knees.

867
00:36:47,421 --> 00:36:48,725
Hands behind your back.

868
00:36:49,036 --> 00:36:51,362
20-David, one suspect in custody.

869
00:36:51,386 --> 00:36:54,070
25-David, GSU number two in custody.

870
00:36:54,095 --> 00:36:56,836
26-David, that's a hat trick, sir.

871
00:36:57,523 --> 00:36:59,806
Get up. Get up.

872
00:37:04,675 --> 00:37:06,632
Y'all took on SWAT.

873
00:37:06,657 --> 00:37:08,376
It was never a competition.

874
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:22,748
Looks like you backed the wrong horse.

875
00:37:23,303 --> 00:37:25,001
Emma's safe.

876
00:37:28,993 --> 00:37:31,256
A lot of mistakes got
you here, Vignisson.

877
00:37:32,464 --> 00:37:33,770
Don't make another one.

878
00:37:36,388 --> 00:37:38,409
You see, that's where
our departments differ.

879
00:37:38,433 --> 00:37:41,543
SWAT is so damn meticulous.

880
00:37:41,567 --> 00:37:43,221
Sheriffs?

881
00:37:43,932 --> 00:37:46,065
We shoot from the hip.

882
00:37:58,790 --> 00:38:00,340
Well, I guess we won't
be waiting for Hondo.

883
00:38:00,364 --> 00:38:03,056
You're under arrest, Lieutenant.

884
00:38:03,589 --> 00:38:05,350
You know the drill.

885
00:38:10,770 --> 00:38:12,052
We recovered a lot of the evidence

886
00:38:12,076 --> 00:38:13,618
these guys were trying to destroy.

887
00:38:13,642 --> 00:38:16,099
Hopefully, we can trace it back
to the houses it came from

888
00:38:16,123 --> 00:38:17,753
and pin the GSU to each robbery.

889
00:38:17,777 --> 00:38:18,928
Along with Emma's testimony,

890
00:38:18,952 --> 00:38:20,321
this case should be open-and-shut.

891
00:38:20,345 --> 00:38:22,018
I know it must've been
tough for you two,

892
00:38:22,042 --> 00:38:24,202
having to go up against fellow officers.

893
00:38:25,298 --> 00:38:26,733
No.

894
00:38:26,758 --> 00:38:29,020
They're nothing but criminals,
plain and simple.

895
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:31,101
Amen to that.

896
00:38:31,443 --> 00:38:33,116
Come on, we got a
meeting with the sheriff.

897
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:34,796
We got a lot to discuss.

898
00:38:37,841 --> 00:38:39,451
Okay. Bye.

899
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:45,083
Well, I guess there's finally
a slot open on the GSU.

900
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,986
Too bad the sheriff's
scrapping the whole team.

901
00:38:49,254 --> 00:38:50,786
Just my luck. I did all those

902
00:38:50,810 --> 00:38:52,527
push-ups for nothing.

903
00:38:53,923 --> 00:38:57,273
Dobes, we never would have found
Emma if it wasn't for you.

904
00:38:57,512 --> 00:38:59,969
You chose SWAT over the GSU,

905
00:38:59,993 --> 00:39:01,666
and I'll never forget it.

906
00:39:01,690 --> 00:39:03,364
I didn't choose SWAT, Deac.

907
00:39:03,388 --> 00:39:04,844
I chose you.

908
00:39:04,868 --> 00:39:06,193
Despite everything that happened,

909
00:39:06,217 --> 00:39:07,695
you're still one of
the best cops I know.

910
00:39:08,002 --> 00:39:09,743
And I hate to admit it, but...

911
00:39:10,123 --> 00:39:12,038
...I still look up to you
after all these years.

912
00:39:13,093 --> 00:39:14,558
Dobes, I j... I just want to say...

913
00:39:14,582 --> 00:39:16,116
Don't need another apology.

914
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:17,967
Fresh start'll do just fine.

915
00:39:18,577 --> 00:39:20,729
How 'bout a fresh start and a cold beer?

916
00:39:20,753 --> 00:39:21,991
Maybe a couple steaks on the grill?

917
00:39:22,015 --> 00:39:24,637
Ah. Now you're talking.

918
00:39:26,193 --> 00:39:28,475
How come you never gave SWAT
another shot?

919
00:39:28,935 --> 00:39:30,957
It's not like I didn't want it.

920
00:39:30,981 --> 00:39:33,188
Hell, I still want it.

921
00:39:33,505 --> 00:39:35,315
But being told you're
not good enough, it...

922
00:39:36,203 --> 00:39:37,465
cuts deep, man.

923
00:39:38,292 --> 00:39:40,171
Well, it's-it's
never too late to try again.

924
00:39:40,195 --> 00:39:41,432
You're joking.

925
00:39:41,456 --> 00:39:42,828
Enrollment just started. I mean,

926
00:39:42,852 --> 00:39:44,206
you've got the experience.
You got the training.

927
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:46,146
Oh, come on, Deac. I'm pushing 50, man.

928
00:39:46,170 --> 00:39:47,692
We don't have an age limit at SWAT.

929
00:39:47,952 --> 00:39:49,802
I mean, if I can pass the PFQs,

930
00:39:49,826 --> 00:39:51,262
you sure as hell can, too.

931
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:53,882
You push yourself as hard as you can.

932
00:39:53,907 --> 00:39:55,298
You shoot for your dream.

933
00:39:55,323 --> 00:39:57,063
This time, pass or fail,

934
00:39:57,088 --> 00:39:58,838
I will be right there by your side.

935
00:40:02,926 --> 00:40:04,797
Be just like old times.

936
00:40:05,798 --> 00:40:08,883
- Deacon and Dobes.
- Deacon and Dobes.

937
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:11,388
Come on.

938
00:40:18,821 --> 00:40:21,126
Hey, Gamble. Hold up.

939
00:40:21,569 --> 00:40:23,249
We barely had a minute
to check in today.

940
00:40:23,783 --> 00:40:25,031
You good?

941
00:40:25,969 --> 00:40:28,093
I heard you caught some flack
over your family history.

942
00:40:28,118 --> 00:40:30,387
Uh, y... A little.

943
00:40:30,431 --> 00:40:32,540
Slapping the cuffs on those GSU bastards

944
00:40:32,564 --> 00:40:33,671
did ease the pain.

945
00:40:33,695 --> 00:40:35,219
What about you and Tan?

946
00:40:35,868 --> 00:40:37,919
Damn. You don't miss a beat.

947
00:40:39,065 --> 00:40:41,327
Yeah. We, uh...
Me and Tan, we had some words.

948
00:40:41,352 --> 00:40:43,310
But we worked it out.

949
00:40:43,335 --> 00:40:44,901
Mm, all good.

950
00:40:44,926 --> 00:40:46,840
The hell are you talking about, Gamble?

951
00:40:46,883 --> 00:40:47,903
Way more than good.

952
00:40:47,927 --> 00:40:49,687
- Hey.
- More than good.

953
00:40:49,711 --> 00:40:50,906
All right.

954
00:40:50,930 --> 00:40:52,255
I like that.

955
00:40:57,556 --> 00:40:59,426
Is that my car?

956
00:40:59,808 --> 00:41:01,612
Scuse me. Scuse me.

957
00:41:01,636 --> 00:41:02,942
Wait, what?

958
00:41:07,448 --> 00:41:09,906
This is all the details
of my dad's arrest.

959
00:41:10,638 --> 00:41:11,943
Where the hell did this come from?

960
00:41:11,968 --> 00:41:13,186
It was just blasted to HQ

961
00:41:13,211 --> 00:41:15,081
from an anonymous LASD email.

962
00:41:15,128 --> 00:41:17,411
Someone here must have
printed out a bunch of copies.

963
00:41:17,435 --> 00:41:18,934
Is this real, Gamble?

964
00:41:18,958 --> 00:41:20,283
Did your dad kill a cop?

965
00:41:20,307 --> 00:41:21,337
Hey.

966
00:41:21,362 --> 00:41:23,058
Gamble's the one on this team,
not her father.

967
00:41:23,083 --> 00:41:24,823
That's right. And she's done nothing

968
00:41:24,848 --> 00:41:26,109
but earn her place on this team
since she got here.

969
00:41:26,134 --> 00:41:28,720
Anybody got a problem,
you speak on it right now.

970
00:41:29,273 --> 00:41:31,338
Nah. Just needed to know
if people were spreading lies

971
00:41:31,362 --> 00:41:32,339
or running their mouths.

972
00:41:32,363 --> 00:41:33,644
Look, either way,

973
00:41:33,668 --> 00:41:35,429
you don't mess with one of our squad.

974
00:41:35,453 --> 00:41:36,778
I told you...

975
00:41:36,802 --> 00:41:38,301
we've got your back, no matter what.

976
00:41:38,325 --> 00:41:40,173
Thanks. But that's everything my dad did

977
00:41:40,197 --> 00:41:41,652
right there in black and white.

978
00:41:41,676 --> 00:41:42,915
Now that it's out,

979
00:41:42,939 --> 00:41:45,028
this kind of stuff's not gonna stop.

980
00:41:45,854 --> 00:41:47,006
Hey, listen up!

981
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:48,964
Whoever put these out,
you got one warning.

982
00:41:48,988 --> 00:41:50,813
You mess with Gamble,
you mess with 20-Squad.

983
00:41:50,837 --> 00:41:52,660
That means you mess with me.

984
00:42:01,210 --> 00:42:03,001
We got you.
