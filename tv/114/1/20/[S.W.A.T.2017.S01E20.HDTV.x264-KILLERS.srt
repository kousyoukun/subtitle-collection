1
00:00:00,093 --> 00:00:01,309
Previously on SWAT...

2
00:00:01,311 --> 00:00:03,708
We're targeting a huge fentanyl operation

3
00:00:03,733 --> 00:00:05,115
being run out of Koreatown.

4
00:00:05,117 --> 00:00:06,367
If you want your son back alive,

5
00:00:06,369 --> 00:00:07,535
you'll meet us alone.

6
00:00:09,238 --> 00:00:10,237
I knew you'd come.

7
00:00:10,239 --> 00:00:11,989
The real top dog who
kidnapped Walsh's son

8
00:00:11,991 --> 00:00:13,991
isn't even in custody... Jae Kim.

9
00:00:13,993 --> 00:00:16,076
Officer, there's obviously
some sort of misunderstanding.

10
00:00:16,078 --> 00:00:19,413
You went after a mother and son
who are like family to me.

11
00:00:48,866 --> 00:00:51,195
He tried to do a full day
back at school last week.

12
00:00:51,197 --> 00:00:52,613
Wasn't ready.

13
00:00:52,615 --> 00:00:54,999
Well, getting kidnapped,
your life threatened,

14
00:00:55,001 --> 00:00:57,251
a knife held to your neck
will mess you up a little bit.

15
00:00:57,253 --> 00:00:58,919
It's just gonna take him
a little time to bounce back.

16
00:00:58,921 --> 00:01:01,541
He's doing fine; I'm the
one that wasn't ready.

17
00:01:01,543 --> 00:01:04,708
Haven't been able to let him
out of my sight since then.

18
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:06,093
It's not healthy.

19
00:01:06,095 --> 00:01:08,178
I got to let him start being a kid again,

20
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:12,433
but Jae Kim turned our lives inside out.

21
00:01:12,435 --> 00:01:13,634
Okay, listen to me.

22
00:01:13,636 --> 00:01:15,436
We are very close to taking him down.

23
00:01:15,438 --> 00:01:16,687
We just need that final piece.

24
00:01:16,689 --> 00:01:19,306
We don't have one by now,
maybe we never will.

25
00:01:19,308 --> 00:01:21,058
We are close, K.C.

26
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,227
Kim buttoned up his fentanyl
operation, but he's gonna have

27
00:01:23,229 --> 00:01:24,361
to dip back in sooner or later.

28
00:01:24,363 --> 00:01:26,981
And when he does, we're gonna be there.

29
00:01:26,983 --> 00:01:29,135
And who's the new guy he's meeting with?

30
00:01:29,137 --> 00:01:30,484
We don't have a name yet,

31
00:01:30,486 --> 00:01:31,785
but his car is registered to the county.

32
00:01:31,787 --> 00:01:33,320
He doesn't look like a big shot.

33
00:01:33,322 --> 00:01:36,123
Maybe it's not about him,
but what he can access.

34
00:01:36,125 --> 00:01:38,125
Either way, I aim to find out.

35
00:01:46,002 --> 00:01:47,668
You said there were three.

36
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:49,837
My fault, I guess there are four.

37
00:01:49,839 --> 00:01:51,088
You need to learn to keep track.

38
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:53,173
- Kitchen knives need to stay together.
- Oh.

39
00:01:53,175 --> 00:01:54,842
I guess I'd better get rid of the shank

40
00:01:54,844 --> 00:01:56,226
I stashed in the bathroom.

41
00:01:57,059 --> 00:01:59,677
Hey, listen. You saw for yourself.

42
00:01:59,679 --> 00:02:02,766
My weapons are all secure.
We got the gun safe.

43
00:02:02,768 --> 00:02:04,351
We're following all the regulations.

44
00:02:04,353 --> 00:02:05,436
We really need to go over cutlery?

45
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:07,521
I just... I got to get to work.

46
00:02:07,523 --> 00:02:10,024
Oh, have your supervisor
sign this while you're there.

47
00:02:10,656 --> 00:02:11,742
Oh.

48
00:02:11,744 --> 00:02:13,327
I thought I could just
loop 'em in verbally.

49
00:02:13,329 --> 00:02:14,695
Skip the formality.

50
00:02:14,697 --> 00:02:16,363
Uh, nothing about parole's a formality.

51
00:02:16,365 --> 00:02:18,282
LAPD needs to know if there's an officer

52
00:02:18,284 --> 00:02:19,533
residing with a convicted felon.

53
00:02:19,535 --> 00:02:21,085
Got it. It's not a problem, ma'am.

54
00:02:21,087 --> 00:02:22,670
It is until I get that signature.

55
00:02:22,672 --> 00:02:24,705
The judge wanted me
to be perfectly clear.

56
00:02:24,707 --> 00:02:26,290
Don't expect favors because you're a cop.

57
00:02:26,292 --> 00:02:27,708
I'm sorry. Were you doing me

58
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:29,259
some kind of favor that I missed?

59
00:02:29,261 --> 00:02:31,211
If your mother violates parole
while living...

60
00:02:31,213 --> 00:02:33,130
It's clear.

61
00:02:33,132 --> 00:02:35,299
Perfectly, ma'am.

62
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:39,803
No alcohol.

63
00:02:39,805 --> 00:02:42,890
Same thing goes for contraband,
obviously.

64
00:02:42,892 --> 00:02:45,025
And if you're planning
on leaving Los Angeles County,

65
00:02:45,027 --> 00:02:46,276
I need you to notify me at least...

66
00:02:46,278 --> 00:02:48,195
Well, I know, after 18 years,

67
00:02:48,197 --> 00:02:52,116
I'm sure there's plenty
to do here in this county.

68
00:02:52,118 --> 00:02:54,234
That changes, notify me through the app

69
00:02:54,236 --> 00:02:55,486
three days prior to travel.

70
00:02:55,488 --> 00:02:57,121
See you next week, Karen.

71
00:02:58,791 --> 00:03:00,240
Okay.

72
00:03:00,242 --> 00:03:02,076
I'm sorry the fridge is so bare.

73
00:03:02,078 --> 00:03:03,627
I did leave you some cash by your phone

74
00:03:03,629 --> 00:03:05,746
if you want to get a bite
while you're out job hunting.

75
00:03:05,748 --> 00:03:07,331
My pho... I don't know where my phone is.

76
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:10,204
Ma, it's-it's charging by your bed.

77
00:03:10,206 --> 00:03:13,137
No, Jimmy, it's your bed. Okay?

78
00:03:13,139 --> 00:03:14,888
I still don't feel right about this.

79
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:16,390
I-I'm gonna sleep on the couch.

80
00:03:16,392 --> 00:03:17,975
I mean, I-I know that
I'm a burden to you.

81
00:03:17,977 --> 00:03:19,393
- I can feel it.
- Ma.

82
00:03:19,395 --> 00:03:21,845
Ma. Listen.

83
00:03:21,847 --> 00:03:25,599
This is a fresh start for both of us.

84
00:03:25,601 --> 00:03:27,017
Have a great day, okay?

85
00:03:27,019 --> 00:03:28,817
- Hmm.
- Okay?

86
00:03:28,819 --> 00:03:29,709
Okay.

87
00:03:29,711 --> 00:03:30,571
Okay.

88
00:03:42,334 --> 00:03:43,834
Here you go, man.

89
00:03:43,836 --> 00:03:45,536
Go ahead. Thanks.

90
00:03:49,074 --> 00:03:50,456
Health Department?

91
00:03:50,685 --> 00:03:52,602
Property Assessment.

92
00:03:54,096 --> 00:03:55,796
You're, um...

93
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,599
Forgive me, I'm blanking. Uh, remind me.

94
00:03:58,601 --> 00:04:00,184
- Ian Peck.
- Ah.

95
00:04:00,186 --> 00:04:01,385
We meet before?

96
00:04:01,387 --> 00:04:03,721
No, no. We have a mutual friend.

97
00:04:03,723 --> 00:04:06,140
Oh. Jae Kim.

98
00:04:07,606 --> 00:04:11,311
You're, uh... in real estate, too?

99
00:04:11,313 --> 00:04:13,313
I have an unfinished project with Kim.

100
00:04:13,315 --> 00:04:15,315
Sounds much more lucrative
than my line of work.

101
00:04:15,317 --> 00:04:16,784
Public sector.

102
00:04:16,786 --> 00:04:18,202
Me, too.

103
00:04:19,951 --> 00:04:21,238
LAPD.

104
00:04:22,408 --> 00:04:25,125
You want to tell me what
you got cooking with Kim?

105
00:04:25,127 --> 00:04:28,495
He owns property. I assess its
value, so we've crossed paths.

106
00:04:28,497 --> 00:04:30,247
How often do you meet
with developers on Sundays

107
00:04:30,249 --> 00:04:31,749
in deserted construction sites?

108
00:04:32,856 --> 00:04:35,836
'Cause that seems pretty
damn suspicious to me.

109
00:04:35,838 --> 00:04:37,971
It was just a simple meeting.

110
00:04:37,973 --> 00:04:39,590
So if I was to dig
into your bank statements,

111
00:04:39,592 --> 00:04:41,975
I wouldn't see any wire
transfers from Kim to you?

112
00:04:41,977 --> 00:04:43,927
Any unexplained cash
hitting your account?

113
00:04:45,981 --> 00:04:48,015
Loyal till the end, huh?

114
00:04:48,017 --> 00:04:49,683
All right, I get it, Kim's the money.

115
00:04:49,685 --> 00:04:51,685
I'm a guy you just met
in a men's bathroom.

116
00:04:51,687 --> 00:04:53,437
I mean, what's he doing?

117
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:54,688
Setting you up with his stable

118
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:56,156
of a-thousand-dollar-an-hour lawyers?

119
00:04:56,158 --> 00:04:57,357
I mean, he's got to be.

120
00:04:57,359 --> 00:04:58,909
I mean, why else would you be
headed down this road?

121
00:04:58,911 --> 00:05:01,078
- I don't have any lawyers.
- You don't?

122
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,580
Do you really think
that some public defender's

123
00:05:03,582 --> 00:05:05,249
gonna keep you from doing hard time?

124
00:05:05,251 --> 00:05:06,581
Hard time?

125
00:05:07,036 --> 00:05:10,087
If anyone should be doing
hard time, it's...

126
00:05:10,961 --> 00:05:12,039
Listen.

127
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:13,674
Kim is not just some...

128
00:05:13,676 --> 00:05:18,128
No, no. It is impossible
to tie him to anything.

129
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:19,379
He's too connected.

130
00:05:19,381 --> 00:05:21,215
Not for me, he's not.

131
00:05:21,217 --> 00:05:23,050
Kim's gonna screw you
the next time he needs to,

132
00:05:23,052 --> 00:05:24,384
and if he doesn't, I will.

133
00:05:25,437 --> 00:05:26,770
So why not screw him first?

134
00:05:27,853 --> 00:05:29,890
His name's plastered on buildings.

135
00:05:29,892 --> 00:05:32,816
He wins awards. He-he cuts ribbons.

136
00:05:33,562 --> 00:05:35,479
But no one knows how bad he really is.

137
00:05:35,481 --> 00:05:38,448
Oh, I do. Trust me, I do.

138
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:40,567
I just need proof.

139
00:05:40,569 --> 00:05:42,736
So what's Peck handing over?

140
00:05:42,738 --> 00:05:45,239
Forged deeds, permits, you name it, K.C.

141
00:05:45,241 --> 00:05:47,074
That Pico-Corridor project

142
00:05:47,076 --> 00:05:48,742
was just Kim's latest scam, apparently.

143
00:05:48,744 --> 00:05:51,628
Peck forged documents
to overvalue his property?

144
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:53,547
Shouldn't it be the other way around?

145
00:05:53,549 --> 00:05:55,716
Well, my guess is, when Kim put
Pico-Corridor up as collateral,

146
00:05:55,718 --> 00:05:56,967
he needed to make sure it was enough

147
00:05:56,969 --> 00:05:58,802
to secure a $25 million loan.

148
00:05:58,804 --> 00:06:00,304
He was hard up for cash

149
00:06:00,306 --> 00:06:02,256
after we made that
fentanyl bust, but that loan,

150
00:06:02,258 --> 00:06:03,473
it comes due tomorrow.

151
00:06:03,475 --> 00:06:04,725
So, what do we nail Kim on?

152
00:06:04,727 --> 00:06:06,093
Real estate fraud?

153
00:06:06,095 --> 00:06:07,845
He deserves to go away for far worse,

154
00:06:07,847 --> 00:06:09,313
but he's been sitting on
the rest of his fentanyl supply

155
00:06:09,315 --> 00:06:11,014
since that bust.

156
00:06:11,016 --> 00:06:13,066
So this might be our best chance
to put that son of a bitch away

157
00:06:13,068 --> 00:06:13,899
for a decade or more.

158
00:06:13,924 --> 00:06:15,602
When do you want to go public with this?

159
00:06:15,604 --> 00:06:18,856
LAPD might not be so thrilled we
found something they couldn't.

160
00:06:18,858 --> 00:06:20,274
Off the books doesn't mean illegal.

161
00:06:20,276 --> 00:06:21,441
A smoking gun is still
a smoking gun, K.C.,

162
00:06:21,443 --> 00:06:22,526
and trust me,

163
00:06:22,528 --> 00:06:24,077
they'll be happy to have the bust.

164
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:26,246
Even if it's uncovered
by a retired DEA agent

165
00:06:26,248 --> 00:06:28,282
- and an off-duty cop?
- Even then.

166
00:06:28,284 --> 00:06:30,500
Peck says to meet him
at the diner in an hour.

167
00:06:32,288 --> 00:06:34,872
Hondo, are you all right?

168
00:06:37,092 --> 00:06:38,876
Hondo!

169
00:07:18,467 --> 00:07:26,519

170
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:55,741
- Thank God you're all right.
- You got cut up.

171
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:57,434
- I'm still standing.
- Attaboy.

172
00:07:57,436 --> 00:07:59,736
- I'm Hondo.
- John Burrows, RHD.

173
00:07:59,738 --> 00:08:01,271
You want to run me
through what went down?

174
00:08:01,273 --> 00:08:03,641
A car pulled up over there
by the stoplight.

175
00:08:03,642 --> 00:08:05,142
I could tell something was off
with these three

176
00:08:05,144 --> 00:08:07,027
before they opened fire,
so I punched the gas

177
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:08,812
and we ended up over there.

178
00:08:08,814 --> 00:08:11,314
I got out and I dropped the
first shooter with two rounds.

179
00:08:11,316 --> 00:08:13,483
The driver took a bullet to the
shoulder, but he kept his feet

180
00:08:13,485 --> 00:08:15,152
and he fled east with the second shooter.

181
00:08:15,154 --> 00:08:17,370
Here's the shell casings.

182
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:20,323
- Kimber's on its way to evidence.
- Some kind of road rage thing?

183
00:08:20,325 --> 00:08:22,993
No, this was a planned hit
and I know who was behind it.

184
00:08:24,496 --> 00:08:26,129
Jae Kim.

185
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:28,548
- The mogul developer guy?
- That's right.

186
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:31,001
I've been digging into Kim
on my free time.

187
00:08:31,003 --> 00:08:33,170
- We've been doing surveillance on him.
- Who's we?

188
00:08:33,172 --> 00:08:34,811
Me and K.C. Walsh.

189
00:08:34,813 --> 00:08:37,090
- Retired DEA Agent Walsh?
- I told you three months ago

190
00:08:37,092 --> 00:08:38,671
to leave the investigating

191
00:08:38,696 --> 00:08:40,310
- to Narcotics.
- And I did.

192
00:08:40,312 --> 00:08:42,179
But when I checked back in, they
hadn't moved the ball an inch.

193
00:08:42,181 --> 00:08:43,513
What about you, sir?

194
00:08:43,515 --> 00:08:45,182
Did you follow up with them
in any of this?

195
00:08:45,184 --> 00:08:46,600
No, you didn't.

196
00:08:46,602 --> 00:08:49,069
I handed you and Narcotics
Kim on a silver platter

197
00:08:49,071 --> 00:08:51,571
and nobody did nothing, so I decided to.

198
00:08:51,573 --> 00:08:54,107
And how would your little hobby
look if we were responding

199
00:08:54,109 --> 00:08:55,575
to an officer killed call here?

200
00:08:55,577 --> 00:08:56,693
I didn't let that happen.

201
00:08:56,695 --> 00:08:57,828
Okay.

202
00:08:57,830 --> 00:08:59,830
Get cleaned up and head back to HQ.

203
00:08:59,832 --> 00:09:02,282
HQ? No. You're not pulling me
off this right now, sir.

204
00:09:02,284 --> 00:09:04,501
You're both our victim
and our only witness,

205
00:09:04,503 --> 00:09:06,036
so you're not staying in the field.

206
00:09:06,038 --> 00:09:08,255
- Hondo, you know the protocol.
- Waive it.

207
00:09:08,257 --> 00:09:10,757
So you can keep playing cowboy? Denied.

208
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:14,711
Get whatever intel you have
to Burrows and assist from HQ.

209
00:09:19,885 --> 00:09:21,218
Glad you're okay, boss.

210
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:22,602
Yo, who did this? Do you remember the guy

211
00:09:22,604 --> 00:09:24,554
behind the kidnapping
of K.C. Walsh's son?

212
00:09:24,556 --> 00:09:26,857
What, Jae Kim? The-the
rich developer dude?

213
00:09:26,859 --> 00:09:28,391
Fentanyl ring went down, Kim never did.

214
00:09:28,393 --> 00:09:29,559
How do you know he did this?

215
00:09:29,561 --> 00:09:31,111
I kept digging into his businesses

216
00:09:31,113 --> 00:09:33,230
and clearly I hit a nerve.
He sent his goons after me.

217
00:09:33,232 --> 00:09:34,564
Look, I need your help.

218
00:09:34,566 --> 00:09:36,783
Did you hear anything on the way
over here that we can use?

219
00:09:36,785 --> 00:09:38,235
Gun and vehicle are scrubbed.

220
00:09:38,237 --> 00:09:39,703
No ID on the dead shooter.

221
00:09:39,705 --> 00:09:41,821
- He got any ink?
- Wolf head on his shoulder blade.

222
00:09:41,823 --> 00:09:43,490
- Profetas.
- Yeah, definitely the Profetas.

223
00:09:43,492 --> 00:09:45,492
- Are they still in Boyle Heights?
- They got caught up in a turf war,

224
00:09:45,494 --> 00:09:46,626
moved to South Gate.

225
00:09:46,628 --> 00:09:48,044
Well, wherever they are,
the driver's got a bullet

226
00:09:48,046 --> 00:09:49,579
in his shoulder,
so he ain't getting too far.

227
00:09:49,581 --> 00:09:51,798
All right, look.

228
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,800
Hicks wants me anchored at HQ.

229
00:09:53,802 --> 00:09:55,585
Street, there's a box
in my den at my house.

230
00:09:55,587 --> 00:09:57,420
You take Chris with you,
you get it to Burrows.

231
00:09:57,422 --> 00:09:59,256
- He's running point for RHD.
- All right.

232
00:09:59,258 --> 00:10:01,725
These Profetas, how do you
want us to go after 'em?

233
00:10:01,727 --> 00:10:04,344
The enemy of your enemy is
never a bad place to start.

234
00:10:04,346 --> 00:10:05,267
Know what I'm saying?

235
00:10:05,292 --> 00:10:06,954
- So it's not considered snitching.
- No?

236
00:10:09,151 --> 00:10:11,294
Hey, Roscoe. I know you?

237
00:10:11,296 --> 00:10:12,686
Busted your brother last year.

238
00:10:12,688 --> 00:10:14,697
What's that got to do with me? New girl?

239
00:10:16,013 --> 00:10:17,207
Was about to find out.

240
00:10:17,209 --> 00:10:18,608
I didn't do anything
to deserve this parade,

241
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:20,076
so why y'all bothering me, dawg?

242
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:21,611
You know anything about
an attempted hit on a cop

243
00:10:21,613 --> 00:10:23,024
about a mile that way?

244
00:10:23,026 --> 00:10:25,224
Nope. Nope. I've been here all day, dawg.

245
00:10:25,226 --> 00:10:26,249
You can ask anybody.

246
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:28,451
Well, we got reason to think
Los Profetas were involved.

247
00:10:28,453 --> 00:10:30,621
Now, do I look like a
freaking Los Profetas to you?

248
00:10:30,646 --> 00:10:31,885
More like a One-Niner.

249
00:10:31,887 --> 00:10:33,790
Profetas have been moving in on
you and your crew, haven't they?

250
00:10:33,792 --> 00:10:35,592
There's been some encroachment, yeah.

251
00:10:35,594 --> 00:10:37,237
So it wouldn't be the worst thing
if they happened to get raided.

252
00:10:37,239 --> 00:10:38,595
- Raided?
- By us.

253
00:10:38,597 --> 00:10:40,263
Today. You tell us where they might

254
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:42,098
be posted up, you give us some good intel

255
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,967
on what we might find that's
good enough for a judge...

256
00:10:43,969 --> 00:10:44,968
And we take 'em down.

257
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:46,770
Now hold on, let me get this straight.

258
00:10:46,772 --> 00:10:48,855
Y'all came all the way down here
just to give me the chance

259
00:10:48,857 --> 00:10:50,807
to make some Los Profetas miserable?

260
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:53,476
Hell.

261
00:10:53,478 --> 00:10:55,278
Why didn't y'all just say so?

262
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,113
Photos, dates.

263
00:10:57,115 --> 00:10:59,950
Sergeant Harrelson documented
a dozen afterhours meetings

264
00:10:59,952 --> 00:11:01,151
Kim had over the last two months.

265
00:11:01,153 --> 00:11:03,320
It's so thorough.

266
00:11:03,322 --> 00:11:04,454
Hondo doesn't do half-assed.

267
00:11:04,456 --> 00:11:06,656
Is there enough here to charge Kim?

268
00:11:06,658 --> 00:11:08,041
Well, the time codes
on these wire transfers

269
00:11:08,043 --> 00:11:09,659
match up with most
of Hondo's meeting log,

270
00:11:09,661 --> 00:11:11,661
but there's nothing
we could prosecute for, yet.

271
00:11:11,663 --> 00:11:15,241
And there is no sign
of this Ian Peck at that diner.

272
00:11:17,419 --> 00:11:20,637
Hey, uh, think Hondo
might've got too deep here?

273
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:22,505
I think Kim has no clue
who he's messed with.

274
00:11:24,643 --> 00:11:26,419
Something wrong?

275
00:11:30,515 --> 00:11:31,648
Hey.

276
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:33,735
18 years really is a long time.

277
00:11:33,737 --> 00:11:35,789
This place is really the future.

278
00:11:35,791 --> 00:11:37,458
All you need is, like, flying cars.

279
00:11:38,357 --> 00:11:40,490
What are you doing here?
H-How did you get inside?

280
00:11:40,492 --> 00:11:41,825
Oh, the guy at the front
is a bit of a talker...

281
00:11:41,827 --> 00:11:43,193
so, guess what.

282
00:11:43,195 --> 00:11:46,029
One of the jobs
that I applied for, they called,

283
00:11:46,031 --> 00:11:47,864
and they want to meet me, today.

284
00:11:47,866 --> 00:11:50,700
♪ Your mama is still employable. ♪

285
00:11:50,702 --> 00:11:51,918
That is great, but you can't

286
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,420
just show up here and scam your way

287
00:11:53,422 --> 00:11:54,871
inside the building, I mean, I could get

288
00:11:54,873 --> 00:11:56,673
in serious trouble for this.

289
00:11:56,675 --> 00:11:58,675
I-I didn't think
that visiting my son was a scam.

290
00:11:58,677 --> 00:12:00,710
I-I just wanted to see where you work.

291
00:12:00,712 --> 00:12:03,617
I mean, I didn't lie or anything.

292
00:12:03,619 --> 00:12:05,441
You're just out on parole.

293
00:12:05,443 --> 00:12:08,229
It's not really a good look
for me right now, that's all.

294
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:10,276
Okay.

295
00:12:10,278 --> 00:12:13,580
Well, um...

296
00:12:13,582 --> 00:12:15,331
I brought you this, because
you need to have it signed,

297
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:17,116
And you know, I mean,

298
00:12:17,118 --> 00:12:19,118
I don't want to cause
any trouble for you.

299
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,372
Okay, thank you.

300
00:12:20,374 --> 00:12:21,572
So...

301
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,732
- So should I leave that way?
- Yeah.

302
00:12:23,734 --> 00:12:25,458
That'd be great.

303
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:37,470
I put one of those
stereos in my car, man.

304
00:12:37,472 --> 00:12:38,855
It sounds great.

305
00:12:38,857 --> 00:12:41,274
- LAPD! Get on the ground now!
- LAPD! SWAT!

306
00:12:41,276 --> 00:12:43,026
- Don't move! Don't move!
- A Code 4 here!

307
00:12:43,028 --> 00:12:44,027
Right side clear!

308
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:45,278
- Give me a two!
- Two!

309
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,927
Looks like stolen stereo equipment.

310
00:12:46,929 --> 00:12:48,815
- Ride side clear!
- Got a wounded suspect in here.

311
00:12:48,817 --> 00:12:50,733
I'll get an R/A rolling.

312
00:12:50,735 --> 00:12:52,242
Let me see those pearly yellows.

313
00:12:52,244 --> 00:12:53,442
Get that thing out of my face.

314
00:12:53,444 --> 00:12:55,288
- Where's the other guy?
- Don't know no other guy.

315
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:58,143
The shooter that got away, Gabriel.

316
00:12:58,145 --> 00:12:59,659
It's time for you to talk.

317
00:12:59,661 --> 00:13:00,809
Go to hell.

318
00:13:00,811 --> 00:13:01,957
Hey.

319
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:04,041
Know the cop that you guys
tried to kill this morning?

320
00:13:04,043 --> 00:13:06,010
The bad news is he's not dead.

321
00:13:06,012 --> 00:13:08,679
Worse news is, he just ID'd you
as the getaway driver.

322
00:13:08,681 --> 00:13:11,432
One shooter's dead, and if
you're the only guy on trial...

323
00:13:11,434 --> 00:13:12,683
I didn't shoot at no cop.

324
00:13:12,685 --> 00:13:13,934
The driver is just as responsible

325
00:13:13,936 --> 00:13:15,386
as the guys slinging the bullets,

326
00:13:15,388 --> 00:13:17,772
so unless you know where
the missing shooter is...

327
00:13:20,943 --> 00:13:22,393
Diego Perez.

328
00:13:23,529 --> 00:13:26,030
Big guy, gold teeth.

329
00:13:26,032 --> 00:13:28,032
I picked him up last night.

330
00:13:28,034 --> 00:13:29,567
He came in from Vegas to pull the job.

331
00:13:29,569 --> 00:13:30,735
Contract killer?

332
00:13:30,737 --> 00:13:31,952
Kim's trying to keep clean.

333
00:13:31,954 --> 00:13:34,121
Kim? Who's she?

334
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:37,825
So he tries to kill you,

335
00:13:37,827 --> 00:13:39,794
but we still don't have enough
to make an arrest?

336
00:13:39,796 --> 00:13:41,545
We will, K.C. Listen.

337
00:13:41,547 --> 00:13:43,330
That $25 million dollar loan
Kim took out,

338
00:13:43,332 --> 00:13:44,749
there's something I can put into motion.

339
00:13:44,751 --> 00:13:45,800
Loan?

340
00:13:45,802 --> 00:13:47,134
We need to find Peck.

341
00:13:47,136 --> 00:13:49,837
He's the one
with the Pico Corridor papers.

342
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:52,256
That's what's gonna put Kim away
and keep Calvin safe.

343
00:13:52,258 --> 00:13:54,058
Look, just hang tight, all
right? I got the rest of my team

344
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:55,676
working on this, let us do our thing.

345
00:13:57,263 --> 00:14:00,147
APB's out on Diego Perez,
haven't gotten a hit yet.

346
00:14:00,149 --> 00:14:02,400
He's probably got an alias.
Maybe we can get Rocker

347
00:14:02,402 --> 00:14:05,152
to put some pressure on our
driver once he's out of surgery.

348
00:14:05,154 --> 00:14:07,104
I grounded you. Where you going?

349
00:14:07,106 --> 00:14:09,156
CAPO unit needs me to sign
a statement over in Legal.

350
00:14:09,158 --> 00:14:10,574
Ah, right, right, right, okay.

351
00:14:10,576 --> 00:14:12,443
Well, give Marty my best.

352
00:14:12,445 --> 00:14:13,861
Then get back here.

353
00:14:22,371 --> 00:14:23,537
Hey, there he is.

354
00:14:23,539 --> 00:14:24,755
Thanks for coming.

355
00:14:24,757 --> 00:14:26,123
Have a seat.

356
00:14:27,293 --> 00:14:29,260
About that paperwork...

357
00:14:30,409 --> 00:14:31,695
Excuse me, ma'am.

358
00:14:31,697 --> 00:14:33,030
- You Carolyn Shaw?
- Mm-hmm.

359
00:14:33,032 --> 00:14:34,131
VP of Corporate Loans?

360
00:14:34,133 --> 00:14:35,015
What's this about, Officer?

361
00:14:35,017 --> 00:14:36,550
It's, uh, "Sergeant," actually.

362
00:14:36,552 --> 00:14:39,220
I just have a question
about your clients, Jae Kim.

363
00:14:39,222 --> 00:14:41,889
If your bank was to loan him 25 million,

364
00:14:41,891 --> 00:14:43,808
you'd be the one to
sign off on it, right?

365
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:45,643
Well, I don't discuss
individual clients...

366
00:14:45,645 --> 00:14:47,778
Look, I shouldn't tell you this,
but before you get

367
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:49,396
more wrapped up in the Jae Kim business,

368
00:14:49,398 --> 00:14:51,649
I think you should know
he's under investigation.

369
00:14:51,651 --> 00:14:53,317
Investigation for what?

370
00:14:53,319 --> 00:14:54,952
Money laundering, drug trafficking,

371
00:14:54,954 --> 00:14:56,954
attempted murder of a police
officer, take your pick.

372
00:14:57,839 --> 00:14:59,623
Now, I'm not supposed to
do this favor for you.

373
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:01,826
I could really get in a lot of
trouble warning you like this,

374
00:15:01,828 --> 00:15:04,462
but I'd hate to see his problems
drag your bank down with him.

375
00:15:04,464 --> 00:15:06,380
I can't believe it,
I was just about to approve

376
00:15:06,382 --> 00:15:08,332
an extension on his loan payment.

377
00:15:08,334 --> 00:15:11,669
Well, I'm no banker, but I'd
think twice before you do that.

378
00:15:11,671 --> 00:15:13,003
Kim's going down.

379
00:15:13,005 --> 00:15:14,421
You didn't hear that from me.

380
00:15:14,423 --> 00:15:15,923
Thank you.

381
00:15:15,925 --> 00:15:17,692
Have a nice day.

382
00:15:20,012 --> 00:15:22,263
Yeah, it's me.

383
00:15:23,516 --> 00:15:26,016
You told me...

384
00:15:26,018 --> 00:15:27,485
He looks really pissed.

385
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:28,903
Yeah, I'm guessing

386
00:15:28,905 --> 00:15:30,020
he's just found out he's gonna

387
00:15:30,022 --> 00:15:31,021
have to pay back that loan

388
00:15:31,023 --> 00:15:32,323
by tomorrow morning.

389
00:15:32,325 --> 00:15:33,657
So what Hondo's next move?

390
00:15:47,507 --> 00:15:49,432
Roll the back window down, please.

391
00:15:52,602 --> 00:15:54,378
You remember me?

392
00:15:55,897 --> 00:15:58,382
The officer who dropped in on
one of my meetings a while back.

393
00:15:58,384 --> 00:15:59,633
Sure, I remember.

394
00:15:59,635 --> 00:16:01,552
I never did get your name.

395
00:16:01,554 --> 00:16:04,355
It's Daniel Harrelson, SWAT.

396
00:16:04,357 --> 00:16:06,640
Just wondering how your
day is going so far.

397
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,059
You really shouldn't meddle

398
00:16:09,061 --> 00:16:11,562
in another person's private business.

399
00:16:11,564 --> 00:16:13,898
Yeah, maybe you should've taken
your own advice four months ago.

400
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,149
I just want you to know,

401
00:16:15,151 --> 00:16:16,700
the next time we see each other,

402
00:16:16,702 --> 00:16:18,402
you will be wearing cuffs.

403
00:16:20,442 --> 00:16:22,840
I hope you enjoy the time you have left.

404
00:16:28,631 --> 00:16:30,414
Peck's county car has a parking pass,

405
00:16:30,416 --> 00:16:32,082
and building's owned
by one of Kim's LLCs.

406
00:16:32,084 --> 00:16:33,551
The guy's on Kim's payroll.

407
00:16:33,553 --> 00:16:36,503
Seems like Sergeant Harrelson
was onto something.

408
00:16:39,642 --> 00:16:41,425
That him?

409
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:46,564
Ian Peck. Okay, that's not good.

410
00:16:46,566 --> 00:16:48,849
Somebody's still here.

411
00:16:53,739 --> 00:16:54,822
K.C.?

412
00:16:55,918 --> 00:16:57,367
No.

413
00:16:58,509 --> 00:16:59,994
I-I found him like that.

414
00:16:59,996 --> 00:17:01,111
Against the wall.

415
00:17:01,113 --> 00:17:03,280
I was gonna call it in,

416
00:17:03,282 --> 00:17:04,498
I just hadn't had a chance to do...

417
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,950
Now. Wait a second.

418
00:17:05,952 --> 00:17:07,785
What...?

419
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:18,385
Did Peck come after you? Did you
kill him in self-defense?

420
00:17:18,387 --> 00:17:22,121
You were found alone with the
victim, you didn't call it in.

421
00:17:22,146 --> 00:17:23,311
You were there illegally.

422
00:17:23,313 --> 00:17:24,813
We found you searching the place.

423
00:17:24,815 --> 00:17:26,281
How do you explain that?

424
00:17:26,283 --> 00:17:28,567
I got his address,
I went there to get the papers

425
00:17:28,569 --> 00:17:31,786
he said would incriminate
Jae Kim and I found him dead.

426
00:17:31,788 --> 00:17:33,788
I was gonna call it in,
but I wanted to see

427
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:35,824
if the paperwork was still there first.

428
00:17:35,826 --> 00:17:37,957
I shouldn't have done it, but...

429
00:17:41,715 --> 00:17:43,465
- She didn't kill him.
- I understand

430
00:17:43,467 --> 00:17:45,550
why you believe that, but
that's not how it looks.

431
00:17:45,552 --> 00:17:47,802
Kim made sure K.C.
came across Peck's address.

432
00:17:47,804 --> 00:17:50,305
And I don't know how,
but he set her up to get to me.

433
00:17:50,307 --> 00:17:52,557
If that's true, traipsing around I.A.

434
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:55,844
with your moonlighting gal pal
put her in that chair,

435
00:17:55,846 --> 00:17:57,345
and got us no closer to nailing Kim

436
00:17:57,347 --> 00:17:58,847
than we were in the first place.

437
00:17:59,516 --> 00:18:00,599
You know what guilty looks like,

438
00:18:00,601 --> 00:18:02,350
and you know she didn't kill that guy.

439
00:18:02,352 --> 00:18:04,319
I'm homicide. On the scale of mysteries,

440
00:18:04,321 --> 00:18:05,520
this isn't much of one.

441
00:18:05,522 --> 00:18:06,905
Walsh was in the room with the body.

442
00:18:06,907 --> 00:18:08,406
Why would she want to kill Peck?

443
00:18:08,408 --> 00:18:10,525
He was our key to taking Kim down.

444
00:18:10,527 --> 00:18:13,111
You want to prove it was someone
else? Prove it was someone else.

445
00:18:13,113 --> 00:18:15,363
I know you think this real
estate guy is behind all this...

446
00:18:15,365 --> 00:18:17,616
Real estate's his shell, man.

447
00:18:17,618 --> 00:18:20,752
Kim oversees one of the biggest
drug operations in the city.

448
00:18:20,754 --> 00:18:23,705
Half the civic leaders in town
send Kim Christmas cards.

449
00:18:23,707 --> 00:18:24,873
Need more than your opinion

450
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:26,591
to take on a guy that plugged in.

451
00:18:26,593 --> 00:18:28,343
He's right. I've never
gotten calls like I have

452
00:18:28,345 --> 00:18:29,461
in the past few hours.

453
00:18:29,463 --> 00:18:30,545
- Me, either.
- From who?

454
00:18:30,547 --> 00:18:32,097
People with pull at City Hall.

455
00:18:32,099 --> 00:18:33,965
Oh, come on, that's just Kim
calling in favors,

456
00:18:33,967 --> 00:18:35,350
trying to shut me down.

457
00:18:35,352 --> 00:18:37,052
Or maybe he feels like
you got a vendetta,

458
00:18:37,054 --> 00:18:39,387
and haven't exactly been
following the rules.

459
00:18:39,389 --> 00:18:41,473
If I give Marty in Legal a call,

460
00:18:41,475 --> 00:18:44,226
is he gonna confirm that you
stopped by his office earlier?

461
00:18:46,067 --> 00:18:47,896
I know when I'm getting the runaround.

462
00:18:47,898 --> 00:18:49,814
From you and Walsh.

463
00:18:49,816 --> 00:18:52,234
So let me be clear:
You're locked in the building

464
00:18:52,236 --> 00:18:54,069
till we get to the bottom of this.

465
00:18:58,125 --> 00:19:00,242
I know how close you are to K.C.,

466
00:19:00,244 --> 00:19:02,327
but she doesn't have
a badge anymore, Hondo.

467
00:19:02,329 --> 00:19:03,795
And that's why I needed to help her.

468
00:19:03,797 --> 00:19:05,747
Kim being free is messing
with her and her son...

469
00:19:05,749 --> 00:19:06,965
he's my godson.

470
00:19:06,967 --> 00:19:08,583
You sure no lines got crossed?

471
00:19:08,585 --> 00:19:10,418
Nothing Hicks can get you for?

472
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:12,671
Are you asking me
if I got my hands dirty?

473
00:19:13,094 --> 00:19:14,923
I think I kept them clean enough.

474
00:19:15,638 --> 00:19:17,723
I thought we had trust.

475
00:19:18,679 --> 00:19:20,645
Why didn't you tell me
what you were doing?

476
00:19:20,647 --> 00:19:22,264
We do have trust.

477
00:19:22,266 --> 00:19:24,599
Maybe I thought I was protecting you.

478
00:19:29,777 --> 00:19:31,273
Rocker sure about this?

479
00:19:31,737 --> 00:19:33,858
Well, he said our getaway
driver's amnesia lifted

480
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:35,493
as soon he woke up handcuffed to the bed.

481
00:19:35,495 --> 00:19:36,661
And our second shooter's traveling

482
00:19:36,663 --> 00:19:37,912
under a different name.

483
00:19:37,914 --> 00:19:39,197
But still a big guy with a goatee?

484
00:19:39,199 --> 00:19:42,000
Big guy, goatee and
a bus ticket to Vegas.

485
00:19:46,796 --> 00:19:48,545
That our guy?

486
00:19:50,594 --> 00:19:52,344
- Hey.
- Hey!

487
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,106
Give me your hands!

488
00:20:05,108 --> 00:20:06,808
- Give me your hands.
- Puta.

489
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:07,809
Shut up.

490
00:20:07,811 --> 00:20:09,525
Got him?

491
00:20:11,231 --> 00:20:12,981
How much do you think is in there?

492
00:20:12,983 --> 00:20:14,649
- Got to be 15 large.
- 20.

493
00:20:14,651 --> 00:20:16,818
What's that, the going rate
for killing cops?

494
00:20:19,156 --> 00:20:21,206
Here you go, kid.

495
00:20:25,629 --> 00:20:26,795
What happened to your face?

496
00:20:26,797 --> 00:20:28,546
I just got in a little fender bender.

497
00:20:28,548 --> 00:20:29,831
It's nothing.

498
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:31,750
Why'd the police come and pick me up?

499
00:20:31,752 --> 00:20:33,468
What's my mom doing back there?

500
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:34,753
Well, since your grandmother's
in Colorado, your mom

501
00:20:34,755 --> 00:20:36,338
asked me to send
a couple guys to pick you up

502
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:38,173
while she answers a few questions.

503
00:20:38,175 --> 00:20:40,058
- Why can't I see her?
- As soon as she's done helping us

504
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:41,509
with our case, you can.

505
00:20:41,511 --> 00:20:42,344
I thought she was retired.

506
00:20:42,346 --> 00:20:43,928
She is. But this particular case

507
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:46,848
is really important to your mom,
and we need her help.

508
00:20:50,604 --> 00:20:53,271
Hey, how about you quit
with the 20 Questions,

509
00:20:53,273 --> 00:20:55,824
you make me look good
and start your grammar.

510
00:20:55,826 --> 00:20:57,275
You know your mom's-a wring my neck

511
00:20:57,277 --> 00:20:58,860
if she thinks I'm letting you slack.

512
00:20:59,241 --> 00:21:00,662
And eat.

513
00:21:00,664 --> 00:21:02,247
Eat.

514
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,367
You're a hell of a godfather.

515
00:21:07,249 --> 00:21:08,536
Kid makes it easy.

516
00:21:08,538 --> 00:21:10,255
Is there anything we can do for him?

517
00:21:10,257 --> 00:21:11,589
Just keep it a regular day
until we figure out

518
00:21:11,591 --> 00:21:12,874
how to get K.C. out of this.

519
00:21:12,876 --> 00:21:15,210
Speaking of that, come with me.

520
00:21:21,184 --> 00:21:23,802
Hondo, I heard what happened.
I'm glad you're okay.

521
00:21:23,804 --> 00:21:25,720
I appreciate that, Commissioner.

522
00:21:25,722 --> 00:21:28,223
A few months ago, Michael
got a call from Jae Kim.

523
00:21:28,225 --> 00:21:30,141
He said a SWAT officer showed up

524
00:21:30,143 --> 00:21:32,894
at an investor meeting
and stepped over the line.

525
00:21:32,896 --> 00:21:34,396
Kim said he felt threatened,

526
00:21:34,398 --> 00:21:35,864
asked me to look into the situation.

527
00:21:35,866 --> 00:21:38,817
I told Kim if he came after
K.C. Walsh or her son again,

528
00:21:38,819 --> 00:21:42,203
I was gonna pay him a visit.
Nothing more to the situation.

529
00:21:42,205 --> 00:21:43,822
Are you sure?

530
00:21:43,824 --> 00:21:45,373
'Cause when I checked in with Narcotics,

531
00:21:45,375 --> 00:21:47,075
they said you got pretty
heated with them, too.

532
00:21:47,077 --> 00:21:48,626
For not taking Jae Kim down.

533
00:21:50,459 --> 00:21:52,211
So when I spoke to Kim again, he said...

534
00:21:52,213 --> 00:21:54,716
Wait a minute. Again? When?

535
00:21:55,297 --> 00:21:57,669
Hold up, are you the reason Kim
knew I was looking into him

536
00:21:57,671 --> 00:22:00,305
for the past couple of months?
The reason I got shot at today?

537
00:22:00,307 --> 00:22:02,557
That's not what I intended.
I never would've spoken to Kim

538
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:04,092
if there was an actual investigation,

539
00:22:04,094 --> 00:22:05,844
but apparently this was you
and an ex-federal agent

540
00:22:05,846 --> 00:22:07,345
looking into things on your own?

541
00:22:07,347 --> 00:22:08,513
I didn't know about it.

542
00:22:08,515 --> 00:22:10,765
Why should you?
You sit on an oversight board.

543
00:22:10,767 --> 00:22:11,933
You don't work in the field.

544
00:22:11,935 --> 00:22:13,268
Doesn't mean you get
to walk into a boardroom

545
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:14,936
- and threaten someone.
- I didn't threaten him.

546
00:22:14,938 --> 00:22:17,689
I know a some people who were there.
Sounded like threats to them.

547
00:22:17,691 --> 00:22:19,407
I know you're smart enough
not to break the rules,

548
00:22:19,409 --> 00:22:20,942
but don't tell me
you didn't bend them here.

549
00:22:20,944 --> 00:22:22,277
Jae Kim was behind the kidnapping

550
00:22:22,279 --> 00:22:23,445
of a ten-year-old boy.

551
00:22:23,447 --> 00:22:25,018
If you could prove that,
he'd be behind bars.

552
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:26,111
Or maybe he just has

553
00:22:26,113 --> 00:22:28,116
too many friends like you
covering his ass.

554
00:22:28,118 --> 00:22:29,367
Come on, Commissioner.

555
00:22:29,369 --> 00:22:30,585
Don't even try to play
like you haven't heard

556
00:22:30,587 --> 00:22:31,753
the rumors of Kim being dirty.

557
00:22:31,755 --> 00:22:33,621
We've had a few business
dealings in the past,

558
00:22:33,623 --> 00:22:34,839
but we're hardly friends.

559
00:22:34,841 --> 00:22:36,458
As for rumors, they're rumors.

560
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:38,460
You try working in construction
without dealing with someone

561
00:22:38,462 --> 00:22:40,962
who's a little questionable.
You'd never build anything.

562
00:22:40,964 --> 00:22:42,464
The only thing I'm trying
to build here, sir...

563
00:22:42,466 --> 00:22:44,054
Both of you need to stop.

564
00:22:44,684 --> 00:22:46,968
Michael, Kim tried to have Hondo killed.

565
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:51,272
Hondo, Michael's not the enemy.
We need to get on the same page.

566
00:22:51,274 --> 00:22:52,724
Yeah, and what page is that?

567
00:22:59,706 --> 00:23:01,489
You recognize him?

568
00:23:01,491 --> 00:23:04,158
Bag of cash came from somewhere.
Want to tell us who paid you?

569
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,660
Nice profit for an unfinished job.

570
00:23:05,662 --> 00:23:07,369
Who asked you to take me out?

571
00:23:08,019 --> 00:23:10,005
I recognize you.

572
00:23:10,007 --> 00:23:12,572
You pulled a SIG P228.

573
00:23:13,083 --> 00:23:15,691
Life gets real bad when you go at a cop,

574
00:23:16,795 --> 00:23:19,162
but lucky for you, I just want
the guy who hired you.

575
00:23:19,882 --> 00:23:23,032
I don't know him.
Never talked to the guy.

576
00:23:23,034 --> 00:23:25,084
Well, that's not good enough, Diego.

577
00:23:25,086 --> 00:23:27,537
Looks like you're gonna do time
for everybody on this. Let's go.

578
00:23:28,682 --> 00:23:30,006
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

579
00:23:30,008 --> 00:23:31,374
Look, listen, look. You want the guy?

580
00:23:31,376 --> 00:23:32,592
All right, you got him.

581
00:23:32,594 --> 00:23:34,877
Now you obviously got a name,
so go ahead and tell me

582
00:23:34,879 --> 00:23:37,296
and I'll repeat it
to whoever you want me to.

583
00:23:39,359 --> 00:23:41,551
Whisper a name in my ear.

584
00:23:46,202 --> 00:23:48,453
That's not how we do things here.

585
00:23:51,914 --> 00:23:54,868
Hey. Heard Diego wouldn't give Kim up.

586
00:23:54,893 --> 00:23:55,904
Couldn't.

587
00:23:55,906 --> 00:23:57,869
Kim put enough layers between
'em to keep him in the clear.

588
00:23:57,870 --> 00:23:59,069
So why'd this hitman still get paid?

589
00:23:59,071 --> 00:24:00,738
'Cause he changed his target to Ian Peck.

590
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:03,374
If Diego killed Peck, that means
K.C.'s off the hook, right?

591
00:24:03,376 --> 00:24:04,408
They're getting him on the record now,

592
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:05,543
but yeah, K.C. should get released.

593
00:24:05,545 --> 00:24:08,712
Great. Hey, could we talk for a sec?

594
00:24:08,714 --> 00:24:09,848
Shoot.

595
00:24:12,251 --> 00:24:15,002
So my mom's staying with me
since she got out,

596
00:24:15,004 --> 00:24:17,555
and everything's great,
but since I'm a cop,

597
00:24:17,557 --> 00:24:19,640
there's this form.
It's kind of a formality.

598
00:24:19,642 --> 00:24:21,175
I just need approval.

599
00:24:21,610 --> 00:24:24,929
To live with a felon.
It's not a formality.

600
00:24:26,406 --> 00:24:27,464
Nice try.

601
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:28,966
So you're not gonna sign for me?

602
00:24:30,994 --> 00:24:33,737
Look, like Annie tells the kids,

603
00:24:33,739 --> 00:24:35,773
don't take three rights to make a left.

604
00:24:36,692 --> 00:24:39,410
Your superior officer needs to sign it.

605
00:24:39,412 --> 00:24:41,046
That's Hondo.

606
00:24:45,151 --> 00:24:47,553
Have you heard of the Chandler Club?

607
00:24:48,337 --> 00:24:50,454
Yeah, that's that
members-only lounge downtown.

608
00:24:50,456 --> 00:24:52,006
Old money L.A. dinosaurs.

609
00:24:52,008 --> 00:24:53,507
New money, too. Kim's a member.

610
00:24:53,509 --> 00:24:55,292
He just booked a room at the club

611
00:24:55,294 --> 00:24:56,760
to pitch some high-end development

612
00:24:56,762 --> 00:24:58,462
on Alvarado to investors.

613
00:24:58,464 --> 00:25:00,798
Oh, okay, so that $25 million
loan's due tomorrow,

614
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:03,100
and he's out shaking the tree
trying to find some cash.

615
00:25:03,102 --> 00:25:05,344
He's desperate. Maybe we can
turn that into a bust.

616
00:25:05,346 --> 00:25:06,577
How?

617
00:25:06,579 --> 00:25:08,305
Michael Plank got an invitation.

618
00:25:08,307 --> 00:25:11,475
Plank... No, no. Hell no.
I don't trust him.

619
00:25:11,477 --> 00:25:12,661
Well, I do.

620
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:17,982
Looks like Kim rotates
the same six properties

621
00:25:17,984 --> 00:25:19,567
among his LLCs every few years.

622
00:25:19,569 --> 00:25:21,035
I still can't prove it in court,

623
00:25:21,037 --> 00:25:22,820
but he is laundering money for a cartel.

624
00:25:22,822 --> 00:25:24,989
The real estate's just a way
of hiding the drug profits.

625
00:25:24,991 --> 00:25:27,157
These cash injections
make no sense otherwise.

626
00:25:27,159 --> 00:25:28,909
Company's built on sand.

627
00:25:28,911 --> 00:25:29,827
It's built on fentanyl.

628
00:25:29,829 --> 00:25:31,045
Appreciate you giving me the chance

629
00:25:31,047 --> 00:25:32,329
to show you I can help here.

630
00:25:32,331 --> 00:25:34,248
You can thank Cortez.

631
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:36,417
Commissioner, you want to help?

632
00:25:36,419 --> 00:25:37,668
Could come with some real danger, though.

633
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:40,004
He went after a kid
last time and me today.

634
00:25:41,273 --> 00:25:43,891
When I got taken hostage in this armory,

635
00:25:43,893 --> 00:25:45,559
your gut instinct helped save my life.

636
00:25:45,861 --> 00:25:47,678
If your gut's right about Kim,

637
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:50,814
and I can help take him down,
then that's what I want to do.

638
00:25:51,229 --> 00:25:52,979
What do you need me to do?

639
00:25:54,437 --> 00:25:56,020
Without entrapping him,

640
00:25:56,022 --> 00:25:58,355
I need you to get Kim to admit
that this development

641
00:25:58,357 --> 00:26:00,024
is just a sham for washing dirty money.

642
00:26:00,026 --> 00:26:01,158
I'm a police commissioner.

643
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,693
Why do you think he'd admit that to me?

644
00:26:02,695 --> 00:26:03,994
He might not,

645
00:26:03,996 --> 00:26:06,780
but he trusted you before
when it came to me.

646
00:26:06,782 --> 00:26:08,532
You're gonna be one
of the richest men in the room.

647
00:26:08,534 --> 00:26:09,700
Kim needs $25 million quick.

648
00:26:11,595 --> 00:26:12,870
Test the microphone.

649
00:26:12,872 --> 00:26:14,431
One-two.

650
00:26:15,708 --> 00:26:17,875
Wow. I can't even feel it's there.

651
00:26:17,877 --> 00:26:19,376
Don't touch your tie
like that, it's unnatural.

652
00:26:19,378 --> 00:26:21,795
Unnatural is how covers get blown.

653
00:26:21,797 --> 00:26:23,714
Kim's gonna be more likely
to say something incriminating

654
00:26:23,716 --> 00:26:25,099
if he's comfortable.

655
00:26:25,101 --> 00:26:26,050
Let him come to you.

656
00:26:26,652 --> 00:26:28,181
Commissioner Plank.

657
00:26:28,183 --> 00:26:29,632
Glad you came.

658
00:26:29,634 --> 00:26:31,105
Missed you in Napa over New Year's.

659
00:26:31,107 --> 00:26:32,890
Jackson Hole for me.

660
00:26:32,892 --> 00:26:34,558
The holidays just seem wrong
without snow.

661
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:37,144
Excuse me. Yeah.

662
00:26:37,146 --> 00:26:38,612
Hey.

663
00:26:38,614 --> 00:26:40,147
Our team will be nearby, ready to go

664
00:26:40,149 --> 00:26:41,982
if he slips or if things go sideways.

665
00:26:41,984 --> 00:26:43,734
- Sideways?
- It can happen.

666
00:26:43,736 --> 00:26:45,486
So my team's gonna be right
outside in the back alley.

667
00:26:45,488 --> 00:26:47,404
We'll send Chris
undercover for your protection.

668
00:26:47,406 --> 00:26:48,906
What if he figures out
I'm wearing a wire?

669
00:26:48,908 --> 00:26:50,491
He won't. He's gonna want to believe you.

670
00:26:50,493 --> 00:26:52,409
Just forget you're wearing one
and you won't screw up.

671
00:26:52,411 --> 00:26:55,295
Excuse me.

672
00:26:55,297 --> 00:26:57,047
He's about to start.

673
00:26:57,049 --> 00:26:58,132
See if you can get closer.

674
00:26:58,134 --> 00:27:00,918
Excuse me, folks.

675
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:03,387
Thank you for coming on short notice.

676
00:27:03,389 --> 00:27:05,089
I can assure you the property development

677
00:27:05,091 --> 00:27:07,758
on Alvarado is well worth your time.

678
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,259
- For those of you who haven't heard...
- Wine, sir?

679
00:27:09,261 --> 00:27:10,594
My investor in China ran into

680
00:27:10,596 --> 00:27:12,896
liquidity problems
after a government crackdown.

681
00:27:12,898 --> 00:27:14,898
The result is

682
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:18,268
I have to replace his
$25 million share by tomorrow.

683
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:20,654
I realize it sounds aggressive.

684
00:27:20,656 --> 00:27:22,773
I'll let you in on a secret.

685
00:27:22,775 --> 00:27:26,276
This share is a $40 million value.

686
00:27:26,912 --> 00:27:27,995
I'm in a delicate situation.

687
00:27:27,997 --> 00:27:29,196
I'm offering

688
00:27:29,198 --> 00:27:32,282
a once in a lifetime deal to my friends.

689
00:27:32,284 --> 00:27:35,786
So please, have a drink, check the specs.

690
00:27:36,388 --> 00:27:37,921
I'll circle around.

691
00:27:39,875 --> 00:27:41,792
Hey, good to see you.

692
00:27:44,146 --> 00:27:45,462
Michael.

693
00:27:45,464 --> 00:27:46,563
You know

694
00:27:46,565 --> 00:27:48,048
that police officer we discussed?

695
00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:50,100
Paid me another uninvited visit today.

696
00:27:50,102 --> 00:27:51,218
He really does

697
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:52,970
have quite the wrong impression of me.

698
00:27:52,972 --> 00:27:54,438
I'm friendly with his
commander. I'll get her

699
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,723
to make sure he leaves you alone.

700
00:27:55,725 --> 00:27:57,224
Focuses on his real job.

701
00:27:57,226 --> 00:27:58,609
Thank you.

702
00:27:58,611 --> 00:27:59,810
I got to be honest.

703
00:27:59,812 --> 00:28:01,311
Buying a stake in Alvarado...

704
00:28:01,313 --> 00:28:02,646
I'm intrigued.

705
00:28:02,648 --> 00:28:03,981
You should be intrigued.

706
00:28:03,983 --> 00:28:05,365
It's an awful lot on short notice,

707
00:28:05,367 --> 00:28:08,485
but who wouldn't want to turn 25 into 40?

708
00:28:08,487 --> 00:28:11,488
Just one thing I'm not sure about.

709
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:12,706
I'd have no problem

710
00:28:12,708 --> 00:28:14,491
letting you invest anonymously, Michael.

711
00:28:14,493 --> 00:28:15,492
No, that's not a problem.

712
00:28:15,494 --> 00:28:16,960
Are we gonna get this guy or what?

713
00:28:16,962 --> 00:28:18,996
He seems to think
he has Michael on the hook.

714
00:28:18,998 --> 00:28:20,497
If better terms are what you want...

715
00:28:20,499 --> 00:28:22,833
The terms are fine.

716
00:28:23,226 --> 00:28:24,835
It's your Chinese investor.

717
00:28:24,837 --> 00:28:27,004
Something doesn't quite add up
with that story.

718
00:28:27,981 --> 00:28:30,340
I don't mind taking risks,

719
00:28:30,942 --> 00:28:33,177
but I just need to know the real deal.

720
00:28:33,179 --> 00:28:35,846
You tell me that,
I can get you the money.

721
00:28:40,786 --> 00:28:43,103
Maybe we wouldn't be
good partners in this.

722
00:28:44,907 --> 00:28:46,190
I really should make the rounds.

723
00:28:46,192 --> 00:28:48,275
Excuse me, Commissioner.

724
00:28:49,002 --> 00:28:50,027
He had him.

725
00:28:50,029 --> 00:28:51,695
What happened? He was too direct.

726
00:28:51,697 --> 00:28:52,913
Or he blew it on purpose.

727
00:28:52,915 --> 00:28:55,365
Got a civilian doing a cop's job,

728
00:28:55,367 --> 00:28:56,533
that's what happened.

729
00:28:56,535 --> 00:28:57,584
We didn't have a choice.

730
00:28:57,586 --> 00:28:59,002
We should get you out of here.

731
00:28:59,004 --> 00:29:00,704
- I got to talk to him again.
- No, Michael.

732
00:29:00,706 --> 00:29:01,538
It's time to go.

733
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:02,956
Door's right behind you, Michael.

734
00:29:02,958 --> 00:29:04,007
Just give me one more shot.

735
00:29:04,009 --> 00:29:05,926
HQ wants you out, Commissioner.

736
00:29:05,928 --> 00:29:08,045
You duck out first.
I'll be right behind you.

737
00:29:13,068 --> 00:29:15,018
Excuse me, everyone.

738
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:16,553
If I can have your attention?

739
00:29:17,189 --> 00:29:18,388
What is he doing?

740
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:20,057
Love to offer a toast.

741
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:22,726
Jae...

742
00:29:22,728 --> 00:29:25,395
you're one of the last
true titans of I.A. real estate.

743
00:29:25,872 --> 00:29:27,898
You've made millions in this town.

744
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:30,651
Some would say
you've given even more back.

745
00:29:30,653 --> 00:29:32,069
They'd be wrong.

746
00:29:33,989 --> 00:29:35,739
You know Alvarado won't turn a profit.

747
00:29:35,741 --> 00:29:37,241
It can't.

748
00:29:37,243 --> 00:29:39,076
It's worth less than half
of its assessment.

749
00:29:39,078 --> 00:29:40,210
You said this property

750
00:29:40,212 --> 00:29:42,246
fell into your lap last month,

751
00:29:42,248 --> 00:29:44,464
but you failed to mention
who you bought it from.

752
00:29:45,251 --> 00:29:46,466
Yourself.

753
00:29:46,468 --> 00:29:48,218
Really?

754
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:49,636
You're a con man.

755
00:29:55,144 --> 00:29:57,761
I don't know if you've had
too much to drink...

756
00:29:58,597 --> 00:30:00,898
My track record speaks for itself.

757
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,850
It's your word against mine.

758
00:30:02,852 --> 00:30:06,987
Whoever invests with you
is throwing away their money.

759
00:30:17,757 --> 00:30:19,499
Nice pivot, Commissioner.

760
00:30:19,501 --> 00:30:21,118
Thanks.

761
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,452
I knew I blew the sting, so I figured

762
00:30:22,454 --> 00:30:23,954
the least I could do was stop Kim

763
00:30:23,956 --> 00:30:25,505
from raising the money
to pay that loan back.

764
00:30:25,507 --> 00:30:26,623
After Kim stopped talking,

765
00:30:26,625 --> 00:30:28,208
- I thought it was over.
- Yeah, me, too.

766
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:30,127
I just couldn't let Kim
sweet-talk someone else

767
00:30:30,129 --> 00:30:31,762
into handing him a check.

768
00:30:31,764 --> 00:30:34,431
So, figured I'd poison the
well for everyone there,

769
00:30:34,433 --> 00:30:36,092
cut off any financial escape route.

770
00:30:36,094 --> 00:30:37,152
Can't bust him,

771
00:30:37,177 --> 00:30:38,468
at least keep him desperate.

772
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:41,021
Target's on your back now, too.
Same as Hondo.

773
00:30:41,023 --> 00:30:42,689
Counting on the pros to
prove he's a criminal

774
00:30:42,691 --> 00:30:43,891
before it comes to that.

775
00:30:43,893 --> 00:30:46,577
Well, Kim's gonna fight
to the end. Burrows.

776
00:30:46,579 --> 00:30:48,145
The Profetas that let our getaway driver

777
00:30:48,147 --> 00:30:50,364
bleed all over their mattress...
where are they now?

778
00:30:50,885 --> 00:30:52,366
So, why'd you bring me back here?

779
00:30:52,368 --> 00:30:54,785
I told you I had no idea they shot a cop.

780
00:30:54,787 --> 00:30:56,954
Before you started lifting stereos...

781
00:30:56,956 --> 00:30:58,121
Profetas were the main distributors

782
00:30:58,123 --> 00:30:59,656
for a fentanyl operation.

783
00:30:59,658 --> 00:31:01,959
Only business went south
a few months ago. Am I right?

784
00:31:02,552 --> 00:31:03,827
Supply dried up, man.

785
00:31:03,829 --> 00:31:05,746
Jae Kim's supply.

786
00:31:06,632 --> 00:31:08,298
Right.

787
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:10,167
I got a funny little feeling

788
00:31:10,169 --> 00:31:11,802
the spigot's about to open up again,

789
00:31:11,804 --> 00:31:14,221
so I need you to tell me when and where.

790
00:31:14,648 --> 00:31:17,007
I do that, and I walk
out of here a free man?

791
00:31:17,009 --> 00:31:18,508
Free as a bird.

792
00:31:22,781 --> 00:31:24,932
Might have to make a few phone calls.

793
00:31:24,934 --> 00:31:27,234
Well, let's get you a phone, then.

794
00:31:27,236 --> 00:31:29,269
There's a shipping yard
right next to the port.

795
00:31:29,271 --> 00:31:30,604
Something's going down right now.

796
00:31:30,606 --> 00:31:31,989
Big dealer named Grasso.

797
00:31:31,991 --> 00:31:33,573
Armin Grasso. Little Armenia.

798
00:31:33,575 --> 00:31:35,025
That's the one. I guess he's been trying

799
00:31:35,027 --> 00:31:36,443
to tap into the fentanyl market
for a while.

800
00:31:36,445 --> 00:31:37,911
Just got his chance tonight.

801
00:31:37,913 --> 00:31:39,529
Kim's making his move. He's unloading

802
00:31:39,531 --> 00:31:41,031
his entire supply he's been sitting on

803
00:31:41,033 --> 00:31:42,532
the past few months for fast cash.

804
00:31:42,534 --> 00:31:43,533
That's got to be huge.

805
00:31:43,535 --> 00:31:44,701
Like, $25 million worth of fentanyl?

806
00:31:44,703 --> 00:31:46,703
Probably more. And there's no way

807
00:31:46,705 --> 00:31:48,872
Kim won't be there personally
to oversee this exchange.

808
00:31:48,874 --> 00:31:50,424
Let's move.

809
00:31:51,424 --> 00:31:52,426
Hey,

810
00:31:52,428 --> 00:31:53,627
you can't come with us.

811
00:31:53,629 --> 00:31:54,544
Like hell I can't.

812
00:31:54,546 --> 00:31:55,512
Hicks has you grounded.

813
00:31:55,514 --> 00:31:57,431
- I'll beg for forgiveness later.
- The goal

814
00:31:57,433 --> 00:32:00,300
is to bust Kim, not bust Kim
and get you suspended. Or worse.

815
00:32:00,302 --> 00:32:02,102
I'm gonna be there when we take Kim down.

816
00:32:02,104 --> 00:32:03,553
He went after my friend.

817
00:32:04,388 --> 00:32:06,857
He went after our friend, too. You.

818
00:32:07,534 --> 00:32:09,142
Look, we got this covered.

819
00:32:09,144 --> 00:32:10,560
Let's not risk prosecution.

820
00:32:10,562 --> 00:32:12,062
Come on, Hondo.

821
00:32:12,064 --> 00:32:13,397
We got him.

822
00:32:13,399 --> 00:32:14,898
We're gonna take Kim down.

823
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:15,899
All the way.

824
00:32:15,901 --> 00:32:17,901
You'd do the same thing
for any one of us.

825
00:32:19,928 --> 00:32:21,377
Go. Go.

826
00:32:34,853 --> 00:32:36,753
Hear that?

827
00:32:43,429 --> 00:32:44,728
Anything from the two vehicles?

828
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:46,813
- Not a peep.
- What about Kim? He show his face?

829
00:32:46,815 --> 00:32:47,931
- Not yet.
- He's slippery.

830
00:32:47,933 --> 00:32:49,399
If he doesn't show up to this,

831
00:32:49,401 --> 00:32:50,467
we got nothing on him.

832
00:32:50,469 --> 00:32:51,568
Keep looking. Three guys

833
00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:52,569
in the truck on the right,

834
00:32:52,571 --> 00:32:53,820
two in the car on the left.

835
00:32:53,822 --> 00:32:54,821
We got 'em both covered.

836
00:32:54,823 --> 00:32:56,440
Tan, how we doing on that line to HQ?

837
00:32:56,442 --> 00:32:57,774
Should be up in a minute.

838
00:33:00,496 --> 00:33:01,611
We got movement.

839
00:33:12,925 --> 00:33:14,291
Anyone see Jae Kim?

840
00:33:14,293 --> 00:33:15,625
Nope.

841
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:26,923
Got him.

842
00:33:39,312 --> 00:33:41,679
Go ahead. Open it up.

843
00:33:49,939 --> 00:33:51,272
Remember, we don't have anything

844
00:33:51,274 --> 00:33:53,074
on Kim until he makes a deal.

845
00:33:53,076 --> 00:33:54,692
The second he gives a nod, we pounce.

846
00:33:54,694 --> 00:33:56,277
This place might explode, so be ready.

847
00:33:56,279 --> 00:33:58,112
- We're all over it, boss.
- I know you are.

848
00:33:58,114 --> 00:33:59,280
Okay, here we go.

849
00:34:01,751 --> 00:34:04,085
- What is this? They're calling it off?
- Luca, you hear anything?

850
00:34:04,087 --> 00:34:05,920
No, whispers are too low, and they didn't

851
00:34:05,922 --> 00:34:07,789
teach Armenian at my high school.

852
00:34:09,676 --> 00:34:11,125
These guys are either
about to make a deal,

853
00:34:11,127 --> 00:34:12,710
or this place is about to go off.

854
00:34:24,808 --> 00:34:27,225
That's $25 million at least. Here we go.

855
00:34:27,227 --> 00:34:28,810
We can't move in
unless there's a confirmation.

856
00:34:28,812 --> 00:34:29,811
A handshake will do.

857
00:34:29,813 --> 00:34:32,313
So, do we have a deal?

858
00:34:34,848 --> 00:34:36,651
Yeah, we got a deal.

859
00:34:37,308 --> 00:34:38,486
Go! Now!

860
00:34:38,488 --> 00:34:39,654
Move in! Move in!

861
00:34:39,656 --> 00:34:40,488
We got him! Go!

862
00:34:40,490 --> 00:34:42,874
LAPD!

863
00:34:42,876 --> 00:34:44,826
- Freeze!
- LAPD!

864
00:34:44,828 --> 00:34:46,294
- Hands up!
- Get to the car!

865
00:34:46,296 --> 00:34:47,712
- Police!
- Get on him!

866
00:34:47,714 --> 00:34:48,996
LAPD!

867
00:34:48,998 --> 00:34:50,665
Drop your weapons now!

868
00:34:50,667 --> 00:34:51,499
On the ground!

869
00:34:53,052 --> 00:34:54,302
I got Kim!

870
00:34:55,638 --> 00:34:57,505
Out of the car! Now!

871
00:35:33,009 --> 00:35:34,592
I got him, Hondo.

872
00:35:34,594 --> 00:35:35,867
I got him.

873
00:35:37,493 --> 00:35:39,797
Bring his ass in.

874
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:06,272
Hey. What's up, Tanner?

875
00:36:07,690 --> 00:36:09,609
Wait, what's going on?

876
00:36:13,917 --> 00:36:15,917
633 Jackson Street.

877
00:36:15,919 --> 00:36:17,242
Yeah, I know it.

878
00:36:19,118 --> 00:36:21,339
All right, man. I'll be right there.

879
00:36:36,856 --> 00:36:38,689
Feels nice, doesn't it?

880
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:40,608
Better than nice.

881
00:36:42,350 --> 00:36:44,612
Don't send his kind away too often.

882
00:36:44,614 --> 00:36:46,581
When we do, they don't
usually stay there.

883
00:36:46,583 --> 00:36:48,282
I have a feeling this one will stick.

884
00:36:55,863 --> 00:36:56,958
Hey, man.

885
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,593
Neighbor saw a trespasser.

886
00:36:58,595 --> 00:37:00,845
When I got here, I saw a figure
climbing out the window.

887
00:37:00,847 --> 00:37:02,046
Found her hiding in the bushes.

888
00:37:02,048 --> 00:37:03,431
Thanks for calling me first, man.

889
00:37:03,433 --> 00:37:04,799
We're really supposed
to take anyone we find

890
00:37:04,801 --> 00:37:05,967
around here into the station.

891
00:37:05,969 --> 00:37:08,269
You know this area.
No one's up to any good.

892
00:37:08,271 --> 00:37:09,470
It's not gonna happen again.

893
00:37:09,472 --> 00:37:11,222
We're really not supposed
to cut corners anymore.

894
00:37:11,224 --> 00:37:12,524
Don't let me get burned for this, man.

895
00:37:12,526 --> 00:37:14,141
You won't. You won't. I promise.

896
00:37:14,143 --> 00:37:15,393
All right.

897
00:37:15,395 --> 00:37:16,759
Thanks.

898
00:37:48,811 --> 00:37:51,228
Why'd you come back here, Mom?

899
00:37:52,669 --> 00:37:55,002
I had to get something.

900
00:37:58,221 --> 00:37:59,386
I've seen this before.

901
00:37:59,388 --> 00:38:01,722
Only thing I ever got from my mother,

902
00:38:01,724 --> 00:38:03,224
except the temper.

903
00:38:04,168 --> 00:38:06,052
When things got bad with your dad and me,

904
00:38:06,054 --> 00:38:09,160
I just... I thought it would be
smart to have an exit strategy.

905
00:38:09,161 --> 00:38:11,378
So I hid it under the floorboards. And...

906
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:14,275
Just... I couldn't
get back here until today, so...

907
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:18,001
I-I'm gonna pawn it, so that, you know,

908
00:38:18,026 --> 00:38:20,576
you don't have to cover all my expenses

909
00:38:20,601 --> 00:38:22,617
until I get a job.

910
00:38:27,146 --> 00:38:29,082
A lot of memories in there.

911
00:38:29,458 --> 00:38:31,124
You want to go inside?

912
00:38:31,149 --> 00:38:32,377
No.

913
00:38:35,951 --> 00:38:38,952
I never, ever meant for you to
have to grow up so fast, Jimmy.

914
00:38:38,954 --> 00:38:40,871
I didn't. I mean,

915
00:38:40,873 --> 00:38:43,471
your father was no good, but...

916
00:38:43,876 --> 00:38:45,959
neither was I, sometimes.

917
00:38:45,961 --> 00:38:48,545
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

918
00:38:53,135 --> 00:38:54,565
It's okay.

919
00:38:55,137 --> 00:38:57,354
Things are better now.

920
00:38:57,860 --> 00:38:59,523
Hmm?

921
00:39:04,391 --> 00:39:06,146
I answered every question right,

922
00:39:06,148 --> 00:39:08,865
but they didn't want me for that job.

923
00:39:12,708 --> 00:39:15,086
I don't know how
I'm gonna make it out here.

924
00:39:35,144 --> 00:39:36,560
Hey, champ.

925
00:39:37,596 --> 00:39:39,179
- How you doing? You good?
- Yeah.

926
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:40,987
Hey, listen.

927
00:39:42,405 --> 00:39:43,984
I want to tell you something,

928
00:39:43,986 --> 00:39:46,019
and you got to promise
you'll always remember.

929
00:39:46,021 --> 00:39:46,987
Promise.

930
00:39:46,989 --> 00:39:48,438
Okay.

931
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,823
There's a word that you're gonna hear

932
00:39:49,825 --> 00:39:51,525
that gets thrown around a lot in life.

933
00:39:51,527 --> 00:39:53,026
"Hero."

934
00:39:53,028 --> 00:39:55,328
Now, it's been watered
down over the years.

935
00:39:55,330 --> 00:39:58,582
It's something we say when
somebody gives a good speech

936
00:39:58,584 --> 00:40:01,201
or when somebody gets shot in the butt.

937
00:40:01,203 --> 00:40:02,369
But, listen,

938
00:40:02,371 --> 00:40:05,038
when a person sticks
with something for months

939
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,791
and doesn't care if they
never get any credit for it

940
00:40:07,793 --> 00:40:10,093
or isn't afraid to take the heat

941
00:40:10,095 --> 00:40:12,095
even though it's not their fault,

942
00:40:12,518 --> 00:40:13,880
that's a real hero.

943
00:40:16,647 --> 00:40:18,885
And that's exactly what your mom is.

944
00:40:19,275 --> 00:40:20,887
- You understand?
- Yeah.

945
00:40:20,889 --> 00:40:23,613
Good. Go let her know.

946
00:40:28,530 --> 00:40:29,696
Ride's waiting out front.

947
00:40:29,698 --> 00:40:31,231
The hotel's all set up.

948
00:40:31,233 --> 00:40:33,567
Double beds, continental
breakfast, the works.

949
00:40:33,569 --> 00:40:35,402
We'll have two officers posted
at your door

950
00:40:35,404 --> 00:40:36,570
until things settle down.

951
00:40:36,572 --> 00:40:37,787
You don't have to do this.

952
00:40:37,789 --> 00:40:39,489
I didn't. Hondo did.

953
00:40:49,472 --> 00:40:50,717
Hey.

954
00:40:50,719 --> 00:40:51,835
Hey.

955
00:40:51,837 --> 00:40:54,170
- You good?
- Yeah.

956
00:40:54,172 --> 00:40:56,590
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just, uh...

957
00:40:56,592 --> 00:40:58,147
I'm relieved.

958
00:41:00,812 --> 00:41:03,146
You guys did great out there.

959
00:41:07,152 --> 00:41:08,699
Hey, uh...

960
00:41:10,105 --> 00:41:12,078
can I ask you a favor?

961
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,863
Surprised you didn't ask Deac.

962
00:41:20,893 --> 00:41:22,499
Oh, he didn't go for it, did he?

963
00:41:23,130 --> 00:41:27,120
Said not to take three rights
to make a left.

964
00:41:27,122 --> 00:41:28,505
Whatever that means.

965
00:41:30,292 --> 00:41:31,681
So can you sign it?

966
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:35,011
Are you sure this is what's best for you?

967
00:41:35,518 --> 00:41:37,728
I'm sure it's what's best for her.

968
00:41:45,807 --> 00:41:47,641
Thanks.

969
00:41:51,530 --> 00:41:53,029
There they are.

970
00:41:53,031 --> 00:41:55,031
Real quick, everyone. Um...

971
00:41:55,496 --> 00:41:57,484
I want to say something.

972
00:41:58,073 --> 00:41:59,656
There's been times in my life

973
00:41:59,681 --> 00:42:01,627
when I didn't feel
like people really had my back.

974
00:42:02,624 --> 00:42:05,256
But what each one of you did
for me out there tonight...

975
00:42:07,462 --> 00:42:09,713
Look, I-I really don't know what to say

976
00:42:09,715 --> 00:42:11,915
except I'll never forget it.

977
00:42:13,719 --> 00:42:15,224
Thank you.

978
00:42:28,266 --> 00:42:34,313
