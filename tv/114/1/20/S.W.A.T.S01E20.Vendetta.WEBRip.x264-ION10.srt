He tried to do a full day
back at school last week.

13
00:00:51,985 --> 00:00:53,487
Wasn't ready.

Well, getting kidnapped,

will mess you up a little bit.

It's just gonna take him
a little time to bounce back.

lawyers?

I mean, why else would you be
headed down this road?

Forged deeds, permits,
you name it, K.C.

137
00:05:46,046 --> 00:05:49,617
That Pico Corridor project
was just Kim's latest scam,
apparently.

138
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:52,553
Peck forged documents
to overvalue his property?

139
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,422
Shouldn't it be
the other way around?

140
00:05:54,488 --> 00:05:56,457
Well, my guess is,
when Kim put Pico Corridor
up as collateral,

141
00:05:56,524 --> 00:05:59,727
he needed to make sure
it was enough to secure
a $25 million loan.

142
00:05:59,793 --> 00:06:01,194
He was hard up for cash

143
00:06:01,261 --> 00:06:03,063
after we made that
fentanyl bust, but that loan,

144
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:04,331
it comes due tomorrow.

145
00:06:04,398 --> 00:06:06,967
So, what do we nail Kim on?
Real estate fraud?

146
00:06:07,034 --> 00:06:08,335
He deserves to go away
for far worse,

147
00:06:08,402 --> 00:06:10,070
but he's been sitting
on the rest of his fentanyl
supply

148
00:06:10,137 --> 00:06:11,539
since that bust.

149
00:06:11,605 --> 00:06:12,840

our best chance

150
00:06:12,906 --> 00:06:14,808

that son of a bitch away
for a decade or more.

to go public with this?

00:08:01,448 --> 00:08:02,916
You want to run me
through what went down?

170
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:05,185
A car pulled up over there
by the stoplight.

171
00:08:05,252 --> 00:08:07,588
I could tell something was off
with these three
before they opened fire,

172
00:08:07,655 --> 00:08:10,758
so I punched the gas
and we ended up over there.

173
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:13,226
I got out and I dropped the
first shooter with two rounds.

174
00:08:13,293 --> 00:08:15,395
The driver took a bullet
to the shoulder,
but he kept his feet

175
00:08:15,462 --> 00:08:17,531
and he fled east
with the second shooter.

176
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:19,366
Here's the shell casings.

177
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:22,235
Kimber's on its way
to evidence.
Some kind of road rage thing?

178
00:08:22,302 --> 00:08:24,572
No, this was a planned hit
and I know who was behind it.

179
00:08:26,473 --> 00:08:28,041
Jae Kim.

180
00:08:28,108 --> 00:08:30,778
The mogul developer guy?
That's right.

181
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:32,880
I've been digging into Kim
on my free time.

182
00:08:32,946 --> 00:08:35,048
We've been doing
surveillance on him.
Who's we?

183
00:08:35,115 --> 00:08:36,650
Me and K.C. Walsh.

184
00:08:36,717 --> 00:08:39,086
Retired DEA Agent Walsh?
HICKS: I told you
three months ago

185
00:08:39,152 --> 00:08:42,155
to leave the investigating
to Narcotics.
And I did.

186
00:08:42,222 --> 00:08:44,257
But when I checked back in,
they hadn't moved the ball
an inch.

187
00:08:44,324 --> 00:08:45,425
What about you, sir?

188
00:08:45,492 --> 00:08:46,994
Did you follow up with them
in any of this?

189
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,528
No, you didn't.

190
00:08:48,596 --> 00:08:50,898
I handed you and Narcotics
Kim on a silver platter

191
00:08:50,964 --> 00:08:53,601
and nobody did nothing,
so I decided to.

192
00:08:53,667 --> 00:08:56,103
And how would
your little hobby look
if we were responding

193
00:08:56,169 --> 00:08:57,571
to an officer
killed call here?

194
00:08:57,638 --> 00:08:59,807
I didn't let that happen.
(CHUCKLES) Okay.

195
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:01,775
Get cleaned up
and head back to HQ.

196
00:09:01,842 --> 00:09:04,311
HQ? No. You're not pulling me
off this right now, sir.

197
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:06,580
You're both our victim
and our only witness,

198
00:09:06,647 --> 00:09:08,081
so you're not staying
in the field.

199
00:09:08,148 --> 00:09:10,283
Hondo, you know
the protocol.
Waive it.

200
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:12,786
So you can keep playing
cowboy? Denied.

201
00:09:12,853 --> 00:09:16,023
Get whatever intel you have
to Burrows and assist from HQ.

202
00:09:21,862 --> 00:09:23,163
Glad you're okay, boss.

203
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:24,698
Yo, who did this?

204
00:09:24,765 --> 00:09:26,566
Do you remember the guy
behind the kidnapping of
K.C. Walsh's son?

205
00:09:26,634 --> 00:09:28,936
What, Jae Kim? The...
The rich developer dude?

206
00:09:29,002 --> 00:09:30,303
Fentanyl ring went down,
Kim never did.

207
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:31,739
How do you know he did this?

208
00:09:31,805 --> 00:09:34,041
I kept digging into his
businesses and clearly
I hit a nerve.

209
00:09:34,107 --> 00:09:35,342
He sent his goons after me.

210
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:36,744
Look, I need your help.

211
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:38,812
Did you hear anything
on the way over here
that we can use?

212
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:40,180
Gun and vehicle
are scrubbed.

213
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:41,649
No ID on the dead shooter.

214
00:09:41,715 --> 00:09:43,751
He got any ink?
Wolf head on
his shoulder blade.

215
00:09:43,817 --> 00:09:45,518
Profetas.
Yeah, definitely
the Profetas.

216
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:46,854
Are they still
in Boyle Heights?

217
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,388
They got caught
up in a turf war,
moved to South Gate.

218
00:09:48,455 --> 00:09:50,457
Well, wherever they are,
the driver's got a bullet
in his shoulder,

219
00:09:50,523 --> 00:09:51,524
so he ain't getting too far.

220
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,794
All right, look.

221
00:09:53,861 --> 00:09:55,829
Hicks wants me anchored at HQ.

222
00:09:55,896 --> 00:09:57,497
Street, there's a box
in my den at my house.

223
00:09:57,564 --> 00:09:59,366
You take Chris with you,
you get it to Burrows.

224
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:01,234
He's running point for RHD.
All right.

225
00:10:01,301 --> 00:10:03,671
These Profetas, how do you
want us to go after 'em?

226
00:10:03,737 --> 00:10:06,473
The enemy of your enemy is
never a bad place to start.

227
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:08,742
MAN: Know what I'm saying? So
it's not considered snitching.
WOMAN: No?

228
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:12,946
Hey, Roscoe.
I know you?

229
00:10:13,013 --> 00:10:14,782
Busted your brother
last year.

230
00:10:14,848 --> 00:10:16,416
What's that got
to do with me?
New girl?

231
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:19,452
ROSCOE:
Was about to find out.

232
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,989
I didn't do anything
to deserve this parade, so
why y'all bothering me, dawg?

233
00:10:22,055 --> 00:10:24,725
You know anything about
an attempted hit on a cop
about a mile that way?

234
00:10:24,792 --> 00:10:28,195
Nope. Nope.
I've been here all day, dawg.
You can ask anybody.

235
00:10:28,261 --> 00:10:30,597
Well, we got reason to think
Los Profetas were involved.

236
00:10:30,664 --> 00:10:33,667
Now, do I look like a freaking
Los Profetas to you?
More like a One-Niner.

237
00:10:33,734 --> 00:10:35,869
Profetas have been
moving in on you and
your crew, haven't they?

238
00:10:35,936 --> 00:10:37,404
There's been some
encroachment, yeah.

239
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,206
So it wouldn't be
the worst thing if they
happened to get raided.

240
00:10:39,272 --> 00:10:40,507
Raided?
DEACON: By us.

241
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:43,043
Today. You tell us
where they might
be posted up,

242
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:45,846
you give us some good intel
on what we might find that's
good enough for a judge...

243
00:10:45,913 --> 00:10:46,980
And we take 'em down.

244
00:10:47,047 --> 00:10:48,849
Now hold on,
let me get this straight.

245
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:50,851
Y'all came
all the way down here
just to give me the chance

246
00:10:50,918 --> 00:10:52,519
to make some Los Profetas
miserable?

247
00:10:54,321 --> 00:10:57,290
(CHUCKLING) Hell.
Why didn't y'all just say so?

248
00:10:57,357 --> 00:10:59,059
BURROWS:
Photos, dates.

249
00:10:59,126 --> 00:11:02,095
Sergeant Harrelson documented
a dozen after-hours meetings

250
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:05,298
Kim had over
the last two months.
It's so thorough.

251
00:11:05,365 --> 00:11:06,466
Hondo doesn't do half-assed.

252
00:11:06,533 --> 00:11:08,635
Is there enough here
to charge Kim?

253
00:11:08,702 --> 00:11:10,203
Well, the time codes
on these wire transfers

254
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:11,739
match up with most
of Hondo's meeting log,

255
00:11:11,805 --> 00:11:13,606
but there's nothing
we could prosecute for, yet.

256
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:16,543
And there is no sign
of this Ian Peck
at that diner.

257
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:22,582
Hey, uh, think Hondo
might've got too deep here?

258
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:24,151
I think Kim has no clue
who he's messed with.

259
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,288
(KAREN LAUGHS)
Something wrong?

260
00:11:32,292 --> 00:11:33,827
Hey.

261
00:11:33,894 --> 00:11:37,430
Eighteen years really
is a long time. This place
is really the future.

262
00:11:37,497 --> 00:11:40,400
All you need is, like,
flying cars. (LAUGHS)

263
00:11:40,467 --> 00:11:42,469
What are you doing here?
How did you get inside?

264
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:45,138
Oh, the guy at the front
is a bit of a talker...
So, guess what.

265
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:47,941
One of the jobs
that I applied for,
they called,

266
00:11:48,008 --> 00:11:50,143
and they want
to meet me, today.

267
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:52,679
* Your mama is
still employable *

268
00:11:52,746 --> 00:11:53,981
STREET: That is great,

269
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:55,115
but you can't just
show up here

270
00:11:55,182 --> 00:11:56,416
and scam your way
inside the building,

271
00:11:56,483 --> 00:11:58,585
I mean, I could get
in serious trouble for this.

272
00:11:58,651 --> 00:12:00,821
I... I didn't think
that visiting my son
was a scam.

273
00:12:00,888 --> 00:12:02,890
I... I just wanted
to see where you work.

274
00:12:02,956 --> 00:12:05,058
I mean, I didn't
lie or anything.

275
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:07,060
You're just out on parole.

276
00:12:07,127 --> 00:12:09,662
It's not really a good look
for me right now, that's all.

277
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:11,932
Okay.

278
00:12:11,999 --> 00:12:15,102
Well, um...

279
00:12:15,168 --> 00:12:17,470
I brought you this, because
you need to have it signed,

280
00:12:17,537 --> 00:12:20,607
And you know, I mean,
I don't want to cause
any trouble for you.

281
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:21,975
STREET: Okay,
thank you.

282
00:12:22,042 --> 00:12:23,443
So...

283
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:25,378
So should I leave that way?
Yeah.

284
00:12:25,445 --> 00:12:26,546
That'd be great.

285
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:38,826
MAN: I put one of those
stereos in my car, man.

286
00:12:38,892 --> 00:12:40,160
It sounds great.

287
00:12:40,227 --> 00:12:42,662
L.A.P.D.!
Get on the ground now!
L.A.P.D.! S.W.A.T.!

288
00:12:42,729 --> 00:12:44,564
Don't move! Don't move!
TAN: A Code 4 here!

289
00:12:44,631 --> 00:12:45,698
LUCA: Right side clear!

290
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:46,967
TAN: Give me a two!
LUCA: Two!

291
00:12:47,034 --> 00:12:48,668
DEACON: Looks like stolen
stereo equipment.

292
00:12:48,735 --> 00:12:50,804
LUCA: Ride side clear!
TAN: Got a wounded
suspect in here.

293
00:12:50,871 --> 00:12:52,272
DEACON: I'll get
an R/A rolling.

294
00:12:52,339 --> 00:12:54,007
Let me see those
pearly yellows.

295
00:12:54,074 --> 00:12:55,208
Get that thing out of my face.

296
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:56,743
Where's the other guy?
Don't know no other guy.

297
00:12:56,810 --> 00:13:00,047
The shooter
that got away, Gabriel.

298
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:01,915
It's time for you to talk.
GABRIEL: Go to hell.

299
00:13:01,982 --> 00:13:03,683
Hey.

300
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,752
Know the cop that you guys
tried to kill this morning?

301
00:13:05,819 --> 00:13:07,720
The bad news is
he's not dead.

302
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:10,357
Worse news is,
he just ID'd you
as the getaway driver.

303
00:13:10,423 --> 00:13:13,160
One shooter's dead,
and if you're the only
guy on trial...

304
00:13:13,226 --> 00:13:14,461
I didn't shoot at no cop.

305
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:15,762
The driver is just
as responsible

306
00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:17,164
as the guys slinging
the bullets,

307
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:19,699
so unless you know where
the missing shooter is...

308
00:13:19,766 --> 00:13:22,735
(EXHALES)

309
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:23,937
Diego Perez.

310
00:13:25,238 --> 00:13:27,740
Big guy, gold teeth.

311
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:29,742
I picked him
up last night.

312
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,211
He came in from Vegas
to pull the job.

313
00:13:31,278 --> 00:13:32,679
Contract killer?

314
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:33,881
Kim's trying to keep clean.

315
00:13:33,947 --> 00:13:35,648
Kim? Who's she?

316
00:13:37,918 --> 00:13:39,853
WALSH: (OVER PHONE)
So he tries to kill you,

317
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,721
but we still don't have enough
to make an arrest?

318
00:13:41,788 --> 00:13:43,490
We will, K.C. Listen.

319
00:13:43,556 --> 00:13:45,225
That $25 million dollar loan
Kim took out,

320
00:13:45,292 --> 00:13:47,527
there's something
I can put into motion.
Loan?

321
00:13:47,594 --> 00:13:48,896
We need to find Peck.

322
00:13:48,962 --> 00:13:51,564
He's the one
with the Pico Corridor papers.

323
00:13:51,631 --> 00:13:54,034
That's what's gonna
put Kim away
and keep Calvin safe.

324
00:13:54,101 --> 00:13:55,502
Look, just hang tight,
all right?

325
00:13:55,568 --> 00:13:57,170
I got the rest of my team
working on this,
let us do our thing.

326
00:13:59,272 --> 00:14:01,875
APB's out on Diego Perez,
haven't gotten a hit yet.

327
00:14:01,942 --> 00:14:04,077
He's probably got an alias.
Maybe we can get Rocker

328
00:14:04,144 --> 00:14:06,813
to put some pressure
on our driver once

It's, uh, Sergeant,
actually.

341
00:14:38,345 --> 00:14:40,948
I just have a question
about your clients, Jae Kim.

342
00:14:41,014 --> 00:14:43,984
If your bank was to
loan him $25 million,

343
00:14:44,051 --> 00:14:45,552
you'd be the one to
sign off on it, right?

344
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:47,387
Well, I don't discuss
individual clients...

345
00:14:47,454 --> 00:14:49,089
Look, I shouldn't
tell you this,

346
00:14:49,156 --> 00:14:51,324
but before you get
more wrapped up
in the Jae Kim business,

347
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,626
I think you should know
he's under investigation.

348
00:14:53,693 --> 00:14:55,328
Investigation for what?

349
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:56,663
Money laundering,
drug trafficking,

350
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,665

officer, take your pick.

351
00:14:59,866 --> 00:15:01,568
Now, I'm not supposed to
do this favor for you.

352
00:15:01,634 --> 00:15:03,703
I could really get in a lot of
trouble warning you like this,

353
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:06,239
but I'd hate to see
his problems drag
your bank down with him.

354
00:15:06,306 --> 00:15:08,441
I can't believe it,
I was just about to approve

355
00:15:08,508 --> 00:15:10,110
an extension
on his loan payment.

356
00:15:10,177 --> 00:15:13,513
Well, I'm no banker,
but I'd think twice
before you do that.

00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,182
Kim's going down.

358
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:17,584
You didn't hear
that from me.
Thank you.

You told me...

362
00:15:28,128 --> 00:15:29,997
He looks really pissed.

363
00:15:30,063 --> 00:15:32,699
Yeah, I'm guessing
he's just found out he's gonna
have to pay back that loan

364

496
00:21:27,219 --> 00:21:29,121
I appreciate that,
Commissioner.

497
00:21:29,188 --> 00:21:31,658
A few months ago, Michael
got a call from Jae Kim.

498
00:21:31,724 --> 00:21:33,526
He said a S.W.A.T.
officer showed up

499
00:21:33,593 --> 00:21:36,295
at an investor meeting
and stepped over the line.

500
00:21:36,363 --> 00:21:39,298
Kim said he felt threatened,
asked me to look
into the situation.

501
00:21:39,366 --> 00:21:42,402
I told Kim if he came after
K.C. Walsh or her son again,

502
00:21:42,469 --> 00:21:45,538
I was gonna pay him a visit.
Nothing more to the situation.

503
00:21:45,605 --> 00:21:47,306
Are you sure?

504
00:21:47,374 --> 00:21:48,675
'Cause when I checked
in with Narcotics,

505
00:21:48,741 --> 00:21:50,477
they said you got pretty
heated with them, too.

506
00:21:50,543 --> 00:21:51,811
For not taking Jae Kim down.

507
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:55,382
So when I spoke
to Kim again, he said...

508
00:21:55,448 --> 00:21:58,851
Wait a minute.
Again? When?

509
00:21:58,918 --> 00:22:01,253
Hold up, are you the
reason Kim knew I was
looking into him

510
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,723
for the past couple of months?
The reason
I got shot at today?

511
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:05,492
That's not what I intended.

512
00:22:05,558 --> 00:22:07,794
I never would've spoken to Kim
if there was an
actual investigation,

513
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:09,862
but apparently this was you
and an ex-federal agent

514
00:22:09,929 --> 00:22:11,030
looking into things
on your own?

515
00:22:11,097 --> 00:22:12,164
I didn't know about it.

516
00:22:12,231 --> 00:22:14,166
Why should you?
You sit on an oversight board.

517
00:22:14,233 --> 00:22:15,702
You don't work in the field.

518
00:22:15,768 --> 00:22:17,604
Doesn't mean you get
to walk into a boardroom
and threaten someone.

519
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:19,338
I didn't threaten him.

520
00:22:19,406 --> 00:22:21,073
I know a some people
who were there. Sounded
like threats to them.

521
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:22,875
I know you're smart enough
not to break the rules,

522
00:22:22,942 --> 00:22:24,411
but don't tell me
you didn't bend them here.

523
00:22:24,477 --> 00:22:26,813
Jae Kim was behind
the kidnapping
of a ten-year-old boy.

524
00:22:26,879 --> 00:22:28,314
If you could prove that,
he'd be behind bars.

525
00:22:28,381 --> 00:22:30,783
Or maybe he just has
too many friends like you
covering his ass.

526
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:33,285
Come on,
Commissioner.

527
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:35,121
Don't even try to play
like you haven't heard
the rumors of Kim being dirty.

528
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:38,257
We've had a few business
dealings in the past,
but we're hardly friends.

529
00:22:38,324 --> 00:22:39,892
As for rumors,
they're rumors.

530
00:22:39,959 --> 00:22:41,761
You try working
in construction without
dealing with someone

531
00:22:41,828 --> 00:22:44,464
who's a little questionable.
You'd never build anything.

532
00:22:44,531 --> 00:22:47,266
The only thing I'm trying
to build here, sir...
Both of you need to stop.

533
00:22:48,468 --> 00:22:50,403
Michael, Kim tried
to have Hondo killed.

534
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:52,739
Hondo,
Michael's not the enemy.

535
00:22:52,805 --> 00:22:54,607
We need to get
on the same page.

536
00:22:54,674 --> 00:22:55,842
Yeah, and what page is that?

537
00:23:05,151 --> 00:23:06,553
You recognize him?

538
00:23:06,619 --> 00:23:09,121
Bag of cash came
from somewhere.
Want to tell us who paid you?

539
00:23:09,188 --> 00:23:10,557
Nice profit for
an unfinished job.

540
00:23:10,623 --> 00:23:11,824
Who asked you
to take me out?

541
00:23:13,325 --> 00:23:14,994
I recognize you.

542
00:23:15,061 --> 00:23:17,930
You pulled a SIG P228.

543
00:23:17,997 --> 00:23:21,934
Life gets real bad
when you go at a cop,

544
00:23:22,001 --> 00:23:24,471
but lucky for you, I just want
the guy who hired you.

545
00:23:25,572 --> 00:23:28,441
I don't know him.
Never talked to the guy.

546
00:23:28,508 --> 00:23:30,342
Well, that's not
good enough, Diego.

547
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:32,879
Looks like you're
gonna do time for
everybody on this. Let's go.

548
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:35,414
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

549
00:23:35,482 --> 00:23:36,683
Look, listen, look.
You want the guy?

550
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:38,084
All right, you got him.

551
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:40,520
Now you obviously got a name,
so go ahead and tell me

552
00:23:40,587 --> 00:23:42,354
and I'll repeat it
to whoever you want me to.

553
00:23:44,757 --> 00:23:46,358
Whisper a name in my ear.

554
00:23:51,664 --> 00:23:52,965
That's not how
we do things here.

555
00:23:57,570 --> 00:24:00,507
Hey. Heard Diego
wouldn't give Kim up.
Couldn't.

556
00:24:00,573 --> 00:24:02,875
Kim put enough layers between
'em to keep him in the clear.

557
00:24:02,942 --> 00:24:04,176
So why'd this hitman
still get paid?

558
00:24:04,243 --> 00:24:05,812
'Cause he changed his target
to Ian Peck.

559
00:24:05,878 --> 00:24:08,147
If Diego killed Peck,
that means K.C.'s
off the hook, right?

560
00:24:08,214 --> 00:24:10,550
They're getting him on the
record now, but yeah, K.C.
should get released.

561
00:24:10,617 --> 00:24:13,686
Great. Hey,
could we talk
for a sec?

562
00:24:13,753 --> 00:24:14,787
Shoot.

563
00:24:17,389 --> 00:24:19,992
So my mom's staying with me
since she got out,

564
00:24:20,059 --> 00:24:22,695
and everything's great,
but since I'm a cop,

565
00:24:22,762 --> 00:24:24,731
there's this form.
It's kind of a formality.

566
00:24:24,797 --> 00:24:26,232
I just need approval.

567
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:29,802
To live with a felon.
It's not a formality.

568
00:24:31,103 --> 00:24:32,471
Nice try.

569
00:24:32,539 --> 00:24:33,906
So you're not
gonna sign for me?

570
00:24:36,342 --> 00:24:38,711
Look, like Annie
tells the kids,

571
00:24:38,778 --> 00:24:40,547
don't take three rights
to make a left.

572
00:24:41,914 --> 00:24:44,517
Your superior officer
needs to sign it.

573
00:24:44,584 --> 00:24:45,785
That's Hondo.

574
00:24:50,657 --> 00:24:53,125
Have you heard of
the Chandler Club?

575
00:24:53,192 --> 00:24:55,427
Yeah, that's that
members-only lounge downtown.

576
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:56,896
Old money
L.A. dinosaurs.

577
00:24:56,963 --> 00:24:58,531
New money, too.
Kim's a member.

578
00:24:58,598 --> 00:25:00,099
He just booked a
room at the club

579
00:25:00,166 --> 00:25:01,768
to pitch some
high-end development

580
00:25:01,834 --> 00:25:03,435
on Alvarado
to investors.

581
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:06,038
Oh, okay, so that $25 million
loan's due tomorrow,

582
00:25:06,105 --> 00:25:08,140
and he's out shaking the tree
trying to find some cash.

583
00:25:08,207 --> 00:25:10,209
He's desperate.
Maybe we can
turn that into a bust.

584
00:25:10,276 --> 00:25:11,410
How?

585
00:25:11,477 --> 00:25:13,379
Michael Plank
got an invitation.

586
00:25:13,445 --> 00:25:16,515
Plank... No, no. Hell no.
I don't trust him.

587
00:25:16,583 --> 00:25:17,584
Well, I do.

588
00:25:20,753 --> 00:25:22,889
Looks like Kim rotates
the same six properties

589
00:25:22,955 --> 00:25:24,791
among his LLCs
every few years.

590
00:25:24,857 --> 00:25:26,058
I still can't
prove it in court,

591
00:25:26,125 --> 00:25:27,894
but he is laundering
money for a cartel.

592
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,996
The real estate's just a way
of hiding the drug profits.

593
00:25:30,062 --> 00:25:32,231
These cash injections
make no sense otherwise.

594
00:25:32,298 --> 00:25:34,901
Company's built
on sand.
It's built on fentanyl.

595
00:25:34,967 --> 00:25:37,303
Appreciate you
giving me the chance
to show you I can help here.

596
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:39,338
You can thank Cortez.

597
00:25:39,405 --> 00:25:41,407
Commissioner,
you want to help?

598
00:25:41,473 --> 00:25:42,742
Could come with some
real danger, though.

599
00:25:42,809 --> 00:25:44,877
He went after a kid
last time and me today.

600
00:25:46,779 --> 00:25:49,015
When I got taken hostage
in this armory,

601
00:25:49,081 --> 00:25:50,617
your gut instinct
helped save my life.

602
00:25:50,683 --> 00:25:52,785
If your gut's
right about Kim,

603
00:25:52,852 --> 00:25:56,088
and I can help take him down,
then that's what I want to do.

604
00:25:56,155 --> 00:25:57,389
What do you need me to do?

605
00:25:59,659 --> 00:26:01,160
Without entrapping him,

606
00:26:01,227 --> 00:26:03,462
I need you to get Kim to admit
that this development

607
00:26:03,529 --> 00:26:05,031
is just a sham
for washing dirty money.

608
00:26:05,097 --> 00:26:07,734
I'm a police commissioner.
Why do you think
he'd admit that to me?

609
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,135
He might not,

610
00:26:09,201 --> 00:26:11,771
but he trusted you before
when it came to me.

611
00:26:11,838 --> 00:26:13,472
You're gonna be one
of the richest men
in the room.

612
00:26:13,539 --> 00:26:14,674
Kim needs $25 million quick.

613
00:26:16,643 --> 00:26:17,844
Test the microphone.

614
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:19,078
One-two.

615
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,682
Wow. I can't even
feel it's there.

616
00:26:22,749 --> 00:26:24,516
Don't touch your tie
like that, it's unnatural.

617
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:26,953
Unnatural is how
covers get blown.

618
00:26:27,019 --> 00:26:30,122
Kim's gonna be more likely
to say something incriminating
if he's comfortable.

619
00:26:30,189 --> 00:26:32,124
Let him come to you.

620
00:26:32,191 --> 00:26:34,694
Commissioner Plank.
Glad you came.

621
00:26:34,761 --> 00:26:36,462
Missed you in Napa
over New Year's.

622
00:26:36,528 --> 00:26:37,830
Jackson Hole for me.

623
00:26:37,897 --> 00:26:39,632
The holidays just seem wrong
without snow.

624
00:26:39,699 --> 00:26:42,134
(CHUCKLES) Yeah.
Excuse me.

625
00:26:42,201 --> 00:26:43,770
Hey.

626
00:26:43,836 --> 00:26:45,204
CORTEZ: Our team will be
nearby, ready to go

627
00:26:45,271 --> 00:26:47,006
if he slips
or if things go sideways.

628
00:26:47,073 --> 00:26:48,407
Sideways?
It can happen.

629
00:26:48,474 --> 00:26:50,576
So my team's gonna be right
outside in the back alley.

630
00:26:50,643 --> 00:26:52,378
CORTEZ: We'll send Chris
undercover for your
protection.

631
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:53,980
PLANK:
What if he figures out
I'm wearing a wire?

632
00:26:54,046 --> 00:26:55,547
HONDO: He won't. He's gonna
want to believe you.

633
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:57,684
Just forget you're wearing one
and you won't screw up.

634
00:26:57,750 --> 00:27:00,486
Excuse me. (CLEARS THROAT)

635
00:27:00,552 --> 00:27:02,021
He's about to start.

636
00:27:02,088 --> 00:27:03,155
See if you can get closer.

637
00:27:03,222 --> 00:27:05,958
KIM: Excuse me, folks.
(CLEARS THROAT)

638
00:27:06,025 --> 00:27:08,360
Thank you for coming
on short notice.

639
00:27:08,427 --> 00:27:10,897
I can assure you
the property development
on Alvarado

640
00:27:10,963 --> 00:27:12,865
is well worth your time.

641
00:27:12,932 --> 00:27:14,867
For those of you
who haven't heard...
Wine, sir?

642
00:27:14,934 --> 00:27:18,237
...my investor in China
ran into liquidity problems
after a government crackdown.

643
00:27:18,304 --> 00:27:19,972
The result is

644
00:27:20,039 --> 00:27:23,275
I have to replace his
$25 million share by tomorrow.

645
00:27:23,342 --> 00:27:25,678
(CROWD MURMURS)
I realize
it sounds aggressive.

646
00:27:25,745 --> 00:27:27,847
I'll let you in on a secret.

647
00:27:27,914 --> 00:27:30,950
This share
is a $40 million value.

648
00:27:31,951 --> 00:27:33,552
I'm in a delicate situation.

649
00:27:33,619 --> 00:27:37,289
I'm offering
a once-in-a-lifetime deal
to my friends.

650
00:27:37,356 --> 00:27:41,193
So please, have a drink,
check the specs.

651
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:42,895
I'll circle around.

652
00:27:42,962 --> 00:27:45,264
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

653
00:27:45,331 --> 00:27:46,632
Hey, good to see you.

654
00:27:49,301 --> 00:27:50,770
Michael.

655
00:27:50,837 --> 00:27:53,305
You know
that police officer
we discussed?

656
00:27:53,372 --> 00:27:55,174
Paid me another
uninvited visit today.

657
00:27:55,241 --> 00:27:58,044
(SIGHS)
He really does have quite
the wrong impression of me.

658
00:27:58,110 --> 00:27:59,311
I'm friendly
with his commander.

659
00:27:59,378 --> 00:28:00,747
I'll get her to make sure
he leaves you alone.

660
00:28:00,813 --> 00:28:02,381
Focuses on his real job.

661
00:28:02,448 --> 00:28:03,549
KIM: Thank you.

662
00:28:03,615 --> 00:28:04,784
PLANK: I got to be honest.

663
00:28:04,851 --> 00:28:07,653
Buying a stake in Alvarado,
I'm intrigued.

664
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,021
KIM: You should be intrigued.

665
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:10,389
It's an awful lot
on short notice,

666
00:28:10,456 --> 00:28:13,793
but who wouldn't want
to turn 25 into 40?

667
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:16,495
Just one thing
I'm not sure about.

668
00:28:16,562 --> 00:28:19,231
I'd have no problem
letting you invest
anonymously, Michael.

669
00:28:19,298 --> 00:28:20,466
PLANK: No,
that's not a problem.

670
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:22,134
Are we gonna get
this guy or what?

671
00:28:22,201 --> 00:28:24,070
He seems to think
he has Michael on the hook.

672
00:28:24,136 --> 00:28:25,504
If better terms are
what you want...

673
00:28:25,571 --> 00:28:26,973
The terms are fine.

674
00:28:28,674 --> 00:28:30,242
It's your Chinese investor.

675
00:28:30,309 --> 00:28:32,044
Something doesn't quite add up
with that story.

676
00:28:33,512 --> 00:28:35,381
I don't mind taking risks,

677
00:28:36,482 --> 00:28:38,650
but I just need to know
the real deal.

678
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:40,152
You tell me that,
I can get you the money.

679
00:28:46,192 --> 00:28:47,860
Maybe we wouldn't be
good partners in this.

680
00:28:49,896 --> 00:28:51,163
I really should
make the rounds.

681
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:52,698
Excuse me, Commissioner.

682
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:55,067
BURROWS: He had him.

683
00:28:55,134 --> 00:28:56,803
What happened?
He was too direct.

684
00:28:56,869 --> 00:28:58,337
Or he blew it on purpose.

685
00:28:58,404 --> 00:29:01,373
Got a civilian
doing a cop's job,
that's what happened.

686
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,809
We didn't have a choice.

687
00:29:02,875 --> 00:29:04,276
We should get you out of here.

688
00:29:04,343 --> 00:29:05,711
I got to talk to him again.
HONDO: No, Michael.

689
00:29:05,778 --> 00:29:07,980
It's time to go.
Door's right behind you,
Michael.

690
00:29:08,047 --> 00:29:09,348
Just give me one more shot.

691
00:29:09,415 --> 00:29:11,283
HQ wants you out,
Commissioner.

692
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:12,919
You duck out first.
I'll be right behind you.

693
00:29:18,524 --> 00:29:19,992
Excuse me, everyone.

694
00:29:20,059 --> 00:29:21,393
If I can have your attention?

695
00:29:22,228 --> 00:29:23,429
HONDO:
What is he doing?

696
00:29:23,495 --> 00:29:24,864
Love to offer a toast.

697
00:29:26,198 --> 00:29:27,834
Jae,

698
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:30,436
you're one of the last
true titans
of L.A. real estate.

699
00:29:30,502 --> 00:29:32,972
You've made millions
in this town.

700
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:35,574
Some would say
you've given even more back.

701
00:29:35,641 --> 00:29:36,909
They'd be wrong.

702
00:29:39,045 --> 00:29:41,180
You know Alvarado
won't turn a profit.

703
00:29:41,247 --> 00:29:42,481
It can't.

704
00:29:42,548 --> 00:29:44,116
It's worth less than half
of its assessment.

705
00:29:44,183 --> 00:29:47,586
You said this property
fell into your lap last month,

706
00:29:47,653 --> 00:29:49,288
but you failed to mention
who you bought it from.

707
00:29:50,389 --> 00:29:51,423
Yourself.

708
00:29:51,924 --> 00:29:53,192
Really?

709
00:29:53,259 --> 00:29:54,426
You're a con man.

710
00:29:58,597 --> 00:30:00,232
(CHUCKLES)

711
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:02,568
I don't know if you've had
too much to drink...

712
00:30:03,936 --> 00:30:05,872
My track record
speaks for itself.

713
00:30:05,938 --> 00:30:07,874
It's your word
against mine.

714
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:12,011
Whoever invests with you
is throwing away their money.

715
00:30:12,078 --> 00:30:13,946
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

716
00:30:23,222 --> 00:30:24,891
Nice pivot, Commissioner.

717
00:30:24,957 --> 00:30:26,192
(CHUCKLES) Thanks.

718
00:30:26,258 --> 00:30:27,559
I knew I blew the sting,

719
00:30:27,626 --> 00:30:28,928
so I figured
the least I could do
was stop Kim

720
00:30:28,995 --> 00:30:30,496
from raising the money
to pay that loan back.

721
00:30:30,562 --> 00:30:33,265
After Kim stopped talking,
I thought it was over.
Yeah, me, too.

722
00:30:33,332 --> 00:30:36,768
I just couldn't let Kim
sweet-talk someone else
into handing him a check.

723
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:39,505
So, figured I'd poison the
well for everyone there,

724
00:30:39,571 --> 00:30:41,407
cut off any financial
escape route.

725
00:30:41,473 --> 00:30:43,509
Can't bust him,
at least keep him desperate.
(CHUCKLES)

726
00:30:43,575 --> 00:30:46,078
Target's on your
back now, too.
Same as Hondo.

727
00:30:46,145 --> 00:30:48,915
Counting on the pros
to prove he's a criminal
before it comes to that.

728
00:30:48,981 --> 00:30:51,617
Well, Kim's gonna fight
to the end. Burrows.

729
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:53,219
The Profetas
that let our getaway driver

730
00:30:53,285 --> 00:30:56,088
bleed all over their mattress,
where are they now?

731
00:30:56,155 --> 00:30:57,589
So, why'd you bring me
back here?

732
00:30:57,656 --> 00:30:59,758
I told you I had no idea
they shot a cop.

733
00:30:59,825 --> 00:31:01,961
Before you started
lifting stereos...
(SCOFFS)

734

...Profetas were
the main distributors
for a fentanyl operation.

735
00:31:04,663 --> 00:31:06,966
Only business went south
a few months ago. Am I right?

736
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:08,901
Supply dried up, man.

737
00:31:08,968 --> 00:31:10,937
Jae Kim's supply.

738
00:31:11,003 --> 00:31:13,672
Right.

739
00:31:13,739 --> 00:31:16,775
I got a funny little feeling
the spigot's
about to open up again,

740
00:31:16,842 --> 00:31:19,678
so I need you to tell me
when and where.

741
00:31:19,745 --> 00:31:21,981
I do that, and I walk
out of here a free man?

742
00:31:22,048 --> 00:31:23,182
Free as a bird.

743
00:31:27,853 --> 00:31:29,956
Might have to make
a few phone calls.

744
00:31:30,022 --> 00:31:32,624
Well, let's get you
a phone, then.

745
00:31:32,691 --> 00:31:34,393
There's a shipping yard
right next to the port.

746
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:35,661
Something's going down
right now.

747
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:36,996
Big dealer named Grasso.

748
00:31:37,063 --> 00:31:38,630
Armin Grasso.
Little Armenia.

749
00:31:38,697 --> 00:31:40,232
CORTEZ: That's the one.
I guess he's been trying

750
00:31:40,299 --> 00:31:41,767
to tap into the fentanyl
market for a while.

751
00:31:41,833 --> 00:31:42,969
Just got his chance tonight.

752
00:31:43,035 --> 00:31:44,503
Kim's making his move.

753
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:46,238
He's unloading
his entire supply
he's been sitting on

754
00:31:46,305 --> 00:31:47,506
the past few months
for fast cash.

755
00:31:47,573 --> 00:31:48,607
That's got to be huge.

756
00:31:48,674 --> 00:31:49,875
Like, $25 million worth
of fentanyl?

757
00:31:49,942 --> 00:31:51,710
Probably more.
And there's no way

758
00:31:51,777 --> 00:31:54,180
Kim won't be there personally
to oversee this exchange.

759
00:31:54,246 --> 00:31:55,381
Let's move.

760
00:31:56,015 --> 00:31:57,316
DEACON: Hey,

761
00:31:57,383 --> 00:31:58,617
you can't come with us.

762
00:31:58,684 --> 00:32:00,486
Like hell I can't.
Hicks has you grounded.

763
00:32:00,552 --> 00:32:02,054
I'll beg for
forgiveness later.

764
00:32:02,121 --> 00:32:05,324
The goal is to bust Kim,
not bust Kim and get you
suspended. Or worse.

765
00:32:05,391 --> 00:32:07,159
I'm gonna be there
when we take Kim down.

766
00:32:07,226 --> 00:32:08,360
He went after my friend.

767
00:32:09,828 --> 00:32:12,531
He went after our
friend, too. You.

768
00:32:12,598 --> 00:32:14,133
Look, we got
this covered.

769
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,501

prosecution.

770
00:32:15,567 --> 00:32:16,802
Come on, Hondo.

771
00:32:16,868 --> 00:32:18,304
We got him.

772
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:19,871
We're gonna take Kim down.

773
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:22,274

for any one of us.

Not a peep.
What about Kim?
He show his face?

779
00:32:51,903 --> 00:32:53,272
Not yet.

we got nothing on him.
