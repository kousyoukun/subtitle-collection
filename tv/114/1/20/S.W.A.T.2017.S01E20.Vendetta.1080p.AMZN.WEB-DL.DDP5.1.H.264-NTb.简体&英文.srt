1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,500
《反恐特警队》前情提要
Previously on SWAT...

2
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:04,690
我们现在瞄准了韩国城中
We're targeting a huge fentanyl operation

3
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:06,100
大量制造芬太尼的犯罪活动
being run out of Koreatown.

4
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:07,480
如果你想要你儿子活命
If you want your son back alive,

5
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:08,560
你必须一个人来见我们
you'll meet us alone.

6
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:10,990
我就知道你会来
I knew you'd come.

7
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:13,050
绑架沃尔什儿子的真正幕后主使
The real top dog who kidnapped Walsh's son

8
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:14,840
杰·金 都没有被抓到
isn't even in custody-- Jae Kim.

9
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:17,200
警官  显然这里面产生了误会
Officer, there's obviously some sort of misunderstanding.

10
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:20,080
你追杀的那对母子
对我来说就像家人一般
You went after a mother and son who are like family to me.

11
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:52,280
他上周想回全日制学校上课
He tried to do a full day back at school last week.

12
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,420
其实还没准备好
Wasn't ready.

13
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:56,030
被绑架 性命受到威胁
Well, getting kidnapped, your life threatened,

14
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:58,010
刀架脖子上 肯定会让人乱了方寸
a knife held to your neck will mess you up a little bit.

15
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,650
要恢复原样是需要时间的
It's just gonna take him a little time to bounce back.

16
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:02,160
他做得很棒 是我没准备好
He's doing fine; I'm the one that wasn't ready.

17
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:04,890
自那以后 就不敢让他离开视线
Haven't been able to let him out of my sight since then.

18
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:06,450
这样不健康
It's not healthy.

19
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:08,920
我得让他重新做回一个孩子
I got to let him start being a kid again,

20
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:13,110
但杰·金彻底改变了我们的生活
but Jae Kim turned our lives inside out.

21
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:14,060
听我说
Okay, listen to me.

22
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:16,450
我们很快就能抓到他了
We are very close to taking him down.

23
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:17,590
只差最后一步
We just need that final piece.

24
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:20,280
我们现在还没证据 也许永远都拿不到
We don't have one by now, maybe we never will.

25
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,020
我们很接近了  KC
We are close, K.C.

26
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:24,450
金拒绝谈及制造芬太尼的行动
Kim buttoned up his fentanyl operation, but he's gonna have

27
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:25,510
但他早晚要露出马脚
to dip back in sooner or later.

28
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:27,220
一旦他暴露  我们一定到场
And when he does, we're gonna be there.

29
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,930
和他见面的新面孔是谁
And who's the new guy he's meeting with?

30
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:30,950
我们还没查到名字
We don't have a name yet,

31
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:32,640
但他的车子登记在县里
but his car is registered to the county.

32
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:33,920
他看着不会有很多线索
He doesn't look like a big shot.

33
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:36,130
也许不是关于他 他只是个媒介
Maybe it's not about him, but what he can access.

34
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:38,410
不管怎么样 我都会查清楚
Either way, I aim to find out.

35
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:48,390
你说有三把
You said there were three.

36
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:50,400
不好意思 应该是四把
My fault, I guess there are four.

37
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:51,580
你得学着记住这些
You need to learn to keep track.

38
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,770
厨房刀必须放在一起
Kitchen knives need to stay together.

39
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:55,770
我想我应该把藏在
I guess I'd better get rid of the shank

40
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:57,160
浴室里的杆子丢掉
I stashed in the bathroom.

41
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:00,840
你自己也看到了
Hey, listen. You saw for yourself.

42
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:03,650
我的武器都安全存放 枪也很安全
My weapons are all secure. We got the gun safe.

43
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:05,030
我们完全按规章行事
We're following all the regulations.

44
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:06,290
真的要把所有刀具都查一遍吗
We really need to go over cutlery?

45
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:08,110
我得去工作了
I just... I got to get to work.

46
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,100
到工作的地方让你的上司签个名
Oh, have your supervisor sign this while you're there.

47
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:14,570
我以为口头说说就行
I thought I could just loop 'em in verbally.

48
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:15,560
跳过这些形式主义
Skip the formality.

49
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:17,300
有关假释的任何事都不是形式主义
Uh, nothing about parole's a formality.

50
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,010
洛城警局需要知道是否有警官
LAPD needs to know if there's an officer

51
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:20,390
和被判刑的重罪犯一起住
residing with a convicted felon.

52
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:21,910
知道了  没问题  长官
Got it. It's not a problem, ma'am.

53
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:23,550
没拿到签名之前就是有问题
It is until I get that signature.

54
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:25,330
法官要我说得非常明白
The judge wanted me to be perfectly clear.

55
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:27,010
别以为自己是警察就有优待
Don't expect favors because you're a cop.

56
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:29,050
抱歉  难道你是在帮我
I'm sorry. Were you doing me

57
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:30,300
而我却没有意识到吗
some kind of favor that I missed?

58
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:32,120
如果你母亲在假释期间违反...
If your mother violates parole while living...

59
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:32,960
很明白
It's clear.

60
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:36,000
非常明白  长官
Perfectly, ma'am.

61
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:40,730
不能喝酒
No alcohol.

62
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:43,390
当然还有走私品也不可以
Same thing goes for contraband, obviously.

63
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:45,950
如果你计划离开洛杉矶县
And if you're planning on leaving Los Angeles County,

64
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:47,370
最起码要通知我
I need you to notify me at least...

65
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:48,950
我知道  十八年牢狱生活后
Well, I know, after 18 years,

66
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:52,980
在这个县里就可以有很多可以做的事情
I'm sure there's plenty to do here in this county.

67
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,050
如有出行变化 最起码提前三天
That changes, notify me through the app

68
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:56,070
通过应用软件通知我
three days prior to travel.

69
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:57,420
下周见  凯伦
See you next week, Karen.

70
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:00,770
好了
Okay.

71
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:02,920
很抱歉冰箱那么空
I'm sorry the fridge is so bare.

72
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:04,690
我给你留了点现金 就在手机旁边
I did leave you some cash by your phone

73
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,490
以防你出去找工作需要
if you want to get a bite while you're out job hunting.

74
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:08,180
手机 我不知道手机在哪里
My pho... I don't know where my phone is.

75
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:10,740
老妈 手机在你床上充电呢
Ma, it's-it's charging by your bed.

76
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:14,040
不 吉米 是你的床
No, Jimmy, it's your bed. Okay?

77
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,650
我还是没习惯
I still don't feel right about this.

78
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:17,030
我要睡在沙发上
I-I'm gonna sleep on the couch.

79
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:19,060
我知道 我知道自己是一个累赘
I mean, I-I know that I'm a burden to you.

80
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:20,320
我知道的
I can feel it.

81
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,360
妈  听着
Ma, Ma. Listen.

82
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:25,480
对我们俩来说这是一个全新的开始
This is a fresh start for both of us.

83
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:27,930
祝你今天过得愉快
Have a great day, okay?

84
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,810
-好  -好吗
- Hmm. ‭- Okay?

85
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:30,660
好的
Okay.

86
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:31,420
好的
Okay.

87
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:44,300
来用吧  老兄
Here you go, man.

88
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:45,930
-用吧  -谢了
- Go ahead. - ‭Thanks.

89
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:50,790
健康部门的
Health Department?

90
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,670
财产评估的
Property Assessment.

91
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:56,270
你是
You're, um...

92
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:59,590
抱歉 脑子一片空白 提醒我一下
Forgive me, I'm blanking. Uh, remind me.

93
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:00,870
伊恩·派克
Ian Peck.

94
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:02,420
我们之前见过
We meet before?

95
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:04,440
不 但我们有个共同的朋友
No, no. We have a mutual friend.

96
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,960
杰·金
‭Jae Kim.

97
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:12,200
你也是干房地产的吗
You're, uh... in real estate, too?

98
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,040
我和金有个没结束的项目
I have an unfinished project with Kim.

99
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,110
听着比我的工作更合算
Sounds much more lucrative than my line of work.

100
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:17,500
公关事务
Public sector.

101
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:18,580
我也是
Me, too.

102
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,160
洛城警局
LAPD.

103
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,680
你要不要谈谈你跟金在搞什么
You want to tell me what you got cooking with Kim?

104
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:29,410
他有财产 我帮他评估 于是有了交集
He owns property. I assess its value, so we've crossed paths.

105
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:31,440
你和开发商周日经常会在
How often do you meet with developers on Sundays

106
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:32,710
荒废的建筑工地见面吗
in deserted construction sites?

107
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,810
因为我看着觉得很可疑
'Cause that seems pretty damn suspicious to me.

108
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:38,700
这只是简单地见个面
It was just a simple meeting.

109
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:40,350
那我要是查你的银行流水
So if I was to dig into your bank statements,

110
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:42,340
不会找到金给你转账的记录咯
I wouldn't see any wire transfers from Kim to you?

111
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:44,840
不会找到你账上有非正常收入
Any unexplained cash hitting your account?

112
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,030
誓死忠诚
Loyal till the end, huh?

113
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,440
行了 我懂 金是你的金主
All right, I get it, Kim's the money.

114
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,210
我不过就是个在男厕所偶遇的人
I'm a guy you just met in a men's bathroom.

115
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:54,240
我说  他在干嘛
I mean, what's he doing?

116
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,540
把你安排在一群
Setting you up with his stable

117
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:56,840
一小时收费一千刀的律师中间
of a-thousand-dollar-an-hour lawyers?

118
00:04:57,090 --> 00:04:57,820
肯定是这样
I mean, he's got to be.

119
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,780
不然你怎么会出现在这里
I mean, why else would you be headed down this road?

120
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,750
-我没有律师  -你没有吗
- I don't have any lawyers. - You don't?

121
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,600
你真觉得公设辩护律师
Do you really think that some public defender's

122
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:06,100
会尽力为你免除长期徒刑吗
gonna keep you from doing hard time?

123
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,030
长期徒刑
Hard time?

124
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:10,140
要是有人坐牢 那必须是...
If anyone should be doing hard time, it's...

125
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:12,930
听着
Listen.

126
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:14,340
金不只是什么...
Kim is not just some...

127
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:18,920
不 不 没办法把他和任何事联系起来
No, no. It is impossible to tie him to anything.

128
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,160
他的关系网太深了
He's too connected.

129
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,380
对我来说不是
Not for me, he's not.

130
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,980
只要对他有用 金下一次就会把你整惨
Kim's gonna screw you the next time he needs to,

131
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,180
如果他没有 我也会的
and if he doesn't, I will.

132
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:27,780
所以干嘛不先发制人
So why not screw him first?

133
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,530
他的名字被刷在大楼上
His name's plastered on buildings.

134
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,190
他们给他颁奖 请他去剪彩
He wins awards. He-he cuts ribbons.

135
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:36,400
但没人知道他到底有多坏
But no one knows how bad he really is.

136
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,420
我知道  相信我  我知道
Oh, I do. Trust me, I do.

137
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:40,660
我就是需要证据
I just need proof.

138
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:43,550
派克给了什么
So what's Peck handing over?

139
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,920
伪造的地契  许可证  应有尽有  KC
Forged deeds, permits, you name it, K.C.

140
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,070
皮卡大道项目显然
That Pico-Corridor project

141
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,800
只是金最近的骗局
was just Kim's latest scam, apparently.

142
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:52,440
派克伪造文件  高估他的财产
Peck forged documents to overvalue his property?

143
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:54,110
难道不应该是反着来吗
Shouldn't it be the other way around?

144
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,980
我猜  金把皮卡大道作为抵押物时
Well, my guess is, when Kim put Pico-Corridor up as collateral,

145
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,920
他必须确保这足够
he needed to make sure it was enough

146
00:05:57,930 --> 00:05:59,430
贷款2500万
to secure a $25 million loan.

147
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,090
芬太尼制毒点被我们清扫之后
He was hard up for cash

148
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,990
他资金短缺  但是贷款
after we made that fentanyl bust, but that loan,

149
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:04,120
明天就到账
it comes due tomorrow.

150
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,410
那么我们给金定什么罪
So, what do we nail Kim on?

151
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,730
房地产诈骗
Real estate fraud?

152
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:08,430
他应该有更大的罪名
He deserves to go away for far worse,

153
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,250
但自从被我们清扫之后 他一直靠着
but he's been sitting on the rest of his fentanyl supply

154
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:11,130
剩下的货赚钱
since that bust.

155
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,830
所以这也许是我们的最好机会 把这混蛋
So this might be our best chance to put that son of a bitch away

156
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:16,450
关上至少十几年
你什么时候准备公开调查
for a decade or more. When do you want to go public with this?

157
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:18,190
洛城警局可能没那么高兴
LAPD might not be so thrilled

158
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:19,680
他们没找到的东西 我们却找到了
we found something they couldn't.

159
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,160
未记录在案不代表非法
Off the books doesn't mean illegal.

160
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,940
有确切的证据在手才是关键 KC
A smoking gun is still a smoking gun, K.C.,

161
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:23,640
相信我
and trust me,

162
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:24,880
他们会很高兴进行搜捕
they'll be happy to have the bust.

163
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,300
即使是被退休缉毒局探员
Even if it's uncovered by a retired DEA agent

164
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,120
-和不当班的警察发现的 -即使这样
- and an off-duty cop? - Even then.

165
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:30,830
派克说一小时后和他在餐馆见面
Peck says to meet him at the diner in an hour.

166
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:34,980
洪都 你还好吗
Hondo, are you all right?

167
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,690
洪都
Hondo!

168
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:22,970
{\an8}反恐特警队
第一季  第二十集

169
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:57,320
-幸好你没事 -你被截杀了
- Thank God you're all right. - You got cut up.

170
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,000
-我还没死 -好样的
- I'm still standing. - ‭Attaboy.‬

171
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:01,180
-我是洪都
-约翰·巴罗斯 劫案凶杀专案组
- I'm Hondo. ‭- John Burrows, RHD.‬

172
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,990
你能告诉我一下发生了些什么吗
You want to run me through what went down?

173
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:05,210
一辆车在红灯那里停下来
A car pulled up over there by the stoplight.

174
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:06,750
他们开火前 我就感觉到
I could tell something was off with these three

175
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:08,420
他们三个不太对 我就踩油门倒车
before they opened fire, so I punched the gas

176
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,950
我们在那里撞上了
and we ended up over there.

177
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,850
我从车里出来 向第一名枪手开了两枪
I got out and I dropped the first shooter with two rounds.

178
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,160
司机肩膀中了枪 但没能阻止他跑
The driver took a bullet to the shoulder, but he kept his feet

179
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,080
他和第二名枪手向东边逃了
and he fled east with the second shooter.

180
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:18,850
这些是弹壳
Here's the shell casings.

181
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:22,340
-金伯公司（反恐特警队配枪制造商）
可以验证 -对方是路怒症吗
- Kimber's on its way to evidence. - Some kind of road rage thing?

182
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:24,460
不 这是场有计划的袭击
我知道是谁指使的
No, this was a planned hit and I know who was behind it.

183
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:27,240
杰·金
Jae Kim.

184
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,430
-那个地产巨头  -没错
- The mogul developer guy? - That's right.

185
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:32,660
我空闲时间都在查金
I've been digging into Kim on my free time.

186
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,890
-我们一直在监控他的行动 
-你们是谁
- We've been doing surveillance on him. - ‭Who's we?‬

187
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:36,420
我和KC·沃尔什
Me and K.C. Walsh.

188
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:39,420
-退休缉毒局探员沃尔什吗 
-我三个月前就告诉你
- Retired DEA Agent Walsh? - I told you three months ago

189
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:41,930
-让毒品调查科管这事 -我这么做了
- to leave the investigating to Narcotics. - ‭And I did.‬

190
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,540
但当我再去核实进展的时候 
发现他们根本就没管这件事
But when I checked back in, they hadn't moved the ball an inch.

191
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:45,410
你做了什么吗 长官
What about you, sir?

192
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:47,280
你有关注过这件事的进度吗
Did you follow up with them in any of this?

193
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,300
不 你没有
No, you didn't.

194
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:51,190
我把金让给你和毒品调查科去查
I handed you and Narcotics Kim on a silver platter

195
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:53,560
却没有人管 所以我决定自己去做
and nobody did nothing, so I decided to.

196
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:56,170
如果我们出警看到了一个警官的尸体
And how would your little hobby look if we were responding

197
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,660
你这业余活动在别人眼里会是什么样
to an officer killed call here?

198
00:08:57,690 --> 00:08:58,660
我没有让这种事发生
I didn't let that happen.

199
00:08:59,160 --> 00:08:59,930
好吧
Okay.

200
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:01,850
整理干净 回总部
Get cleaned up and head back to HQ.

201
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:04,250
总部 你不能现在就把我撤回去 长官
HQ? No. You're not pulling me off this right now, sir.

202
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,390
你既是受害人 也是唯一的目击证人
You're both our victim and our only witness,

203
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:07,880
所以你不能继续参与办案了
so you're not staying in the field.

204
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:09,990
-洪都 你知道规定的  -取消它
- Hondo, you know the protocol. - ‭Waive it.‬

205
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:12,620
然后你可以继续这么干吗 不行
So you can keep playing cowboy? Denied.

206
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,110
把你知道的信息都告诉巴罗斯
在总部协助办案
Get whatever intel you have to Burrows and assist from HQ.

207
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:22,840
你没事就好 头儿
Glad you're okay, boss.

208
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:24,800
-谁干的  -你还记得那个
- Yo, who did this? - Do you remember the guy

209
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,490
绑架KC·沃尔什儿子的背后指使者吗
behind the kidnapping of K.C. Walsh's son?

210
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,600
什么 杰·金 那个有钱的开发商吗
What, Jae Kim? The-the rich developer dude?

211
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,350
芬太尼制毒链倒了 金没事
Fentanyl ring went down, Kim never did.

212
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:31,650
你怎么知道是他干的
How do you know he did this?

213
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:33,230
我一直在查他的生意
I kept digging into his businesses

214
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:35,250
显然我触到他的神经了 他派人来追杀我
and clearly I hit a nerve. He sent his goons after me.

215
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,450
我需要你们的帮助
Look, I need your help.

216
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:38,780
你们来的路上
有听到什么有帮助的线索吗
Did you hear anything on the way over here that we can use?

217
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:40,310
枪和车的编号都磨掉了
Gun and vehicle are scrubbed.

218
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:41,520
身亡的枪手无法确认身份
No ID on the dead shooter.

219
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:43,680
-他有纹身吗 -肩胛骨处有个狼头
- He got any ink? - Wolf head on his shoulder blade.

220
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:45,460
先知帮 绝对是他们
Profetas. Yeah, definitely the Profetas.

221
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,500
他们还在博伊尔高地吗
Are they still in Boyle Heights?

222
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:48,270
他们被卷入了一场地盘争夺战
搬去南盖特了
They got caught up in a turf war, moved to South Gate.

223
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:49,980
不管他们在哪 司机肩部中枪了
Well, wherever they are, the driver's got a bullet

224
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,500
所以他跑不了多远
in his shoulder, so he ain't getting too far.

225
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:52,710
好了  听着
All right, look.

226
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,340
希克斯想让我回总部
Hicks wants me anchored at HQ.

227
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:57,510
斯特里特 我房间里有个盒子
Street, there's a box in my den at my house.

228
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:59,320
你和克里斯一起去
你们把那个给巴罗斯
You take Chris with you, you get it to Burrows.

229
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:00,960
-他是劫案凶杀专案组的人 -好的
- He's running point for RHD. - All right.

230
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:03,600
这些先知帮的人 你想让我们怎么抓他们
These Profetas, how do you want us to go after 'em?

231
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,280
敌人的敌人永远不是一个坏的开始
The enemy of your enemy is never a bad place to start.

232
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:07,000
知道我在说什么吗
Know what I'm saying?

233
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:08,510
-这不算告密  -不
- So it's not considered snitching. - No?

234
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:12,930
-罗斯科  -我认识你吗
- Hey, Roscoe. - ‭I know you?‬

235
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:14,630
去年抓了你的兄弟
Busted your brother last year.

236
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:16,340
-这和我有什么关系 -新姑娘吗
- What's that got to do with me? - New girl?

237
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,000
还有待考察
Was about to find out.

238
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:20,830
我没做什么值得你们大张旗鼓前来的事
I didn't do anything to deserve this parade,

239
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,050
你们来找我干啥 大哥
so why y'all bothering me, dawg?

240
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:23,950
你知道往那边1.5公里
You know anything about an attempted hit on a cop

241
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:24,750
有人试图袭击警察吗
about a mile that way?

242
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,930
不 我在这儿一整天了 大哥
Nope. Nope. I've been here all day, dawg.

243
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,260
你可以问任何人
You can ask anybody.

244
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:30,500
我们有理由认为先知帮参与其中
Well, we got reason to think Los Profetas were involved.

245
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:31,660
那在你们看来我现在像一个
Now, do I look like a freaking

246
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:33,610
-先知帮的成员吗 -更像是一九帮的
- Los Profetas to you? - More like a One-Niner.

247
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:35,850
先知帮一直在抢夺你们的地盘 不是吗
Profetas have been moving in on you and your crew, haven't they?

248
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:37,770
-是有一些侵占问题
-如果他们正好被突袭了
- There's been some encroachment, yeah. ‭- So it wouldn't be

249
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:39,090
对你们来说也不算坏事吧
the worst thing if they happened to get raided.

250
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:40,230
-突袭  -我们突袭
- Raided? ‭- By us.

251
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:42,480
今天 你告诉我们他们
Today. You tell us where they might

252
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:44,100
可能会在哪里出现 你给我们一些
be posted up, you give us some good intel

253
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,950
对审判有用的情报
on what we might find that's good enough for a judge...

254
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:46,880
我们会拿下他们
And we take 'em down.

255
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:48,410
等会儿 让我弄清楚
Now hold on, let me get this straight.

256
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:50,900
你们这么大老远过来就是为了
Y'all came all the way down here just to give me the chance

257
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:52,280
给我个机会让先知帮不好过
to make some Los Profetas miserable?

258
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,290
靠
Hell.

259
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:56,710
你们怎么不早说
Why didn't y'all just say so?

260
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:59,010
照片 日期
Photos, dates.

261
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:02,050
哈里森警司记录了一打过去两个月
Sergeant Harrelson documented a dozen afterhours meetings

262
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:03,330
金在非常规时间的会面
Kim had over the last two months.

263
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:05,310
记录得非常详细
It's so thorough.

264
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:06,540
洪都做事一直都很靠谱
Hondo doesn't do half-assed.

265
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,330
这里的证据足以起诉金吗
Is there enough here to charge Kim?

266
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,280
这些电汇的时间点
Well, the time codes on these wire transfers

267
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,750
与洪都记录的会面时间大致匹配
match up with most of Hondo's meeting log,

268
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:13,590
但是这还不够我们去起诉他
but there's nothing we could prosecute for, yet.

269
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:16,300
而且伊恩·派克也没在餐厅出现
And there is no sign of this Ian Peck at that diner.

270
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:22,360
你觉得洪都是不是陷得太深了
Hey, uh, think Hondo might've got too deep here?

271
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,220
我觉得金还不知道他惹上谁了
I think Kim has no clue who he's messed with.

272
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:27,620
有什么不对劲吗
Something wrong?

273
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:35,980
十八年真的是一段很长的时间
18 years really is a long time.

274
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:37,630
这个地方就像是个未来世界
This place is really the future.

275
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:39,450
你能想象到的都有
All you need is, like, flying cars.

276
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,980
你来这干什么  你怎么进来的
What are you doing here? H-How did you get inside?

277
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,860
前面的那家伙话太多了
Oh, the guy at the front is a bit of a talker--

278
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,180
你猜怎么着
so, guess what.

279
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,910
我申请的其中一个工作单位回我电话了
One of the jobs that I applied for, they called,

280
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:49,990
他们想在今天见我
and they want to meet me, today.

281
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:52,840
♪ 你老妈我还是有市场的 ♪
♪ Your mama is still employable. ♪

282
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,310
那挺好的  但是你不能
That is great, but you can't

283
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:55,580
这样出现 骗别人放你进这里
just show up here and scam your way

284
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:57,030
我是说 我有可能
inside the building, I mean, I could get

285
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:58,110
会因此惹上麻烦的
in serious trouble for this.

286
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:00,830
我不认为"来看我儿子"是骗人的
I-I didn't think that visiting my son was a scam.

287
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,760
我就是想看看你工作的地方
I-I just wanted to see where you work.

288
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:05,300
我没有撒谎
I mean, I didn't lie or anything.

289
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:07,260
你才刚刚假释出来
You're just out on parole.

290
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:09,800
这对我来说不是很好 仅此而已
It's not really a good look for me right now, that's all.

291
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:11,400
好吧
Okay.

292
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:17,610
我带了这个给你 因为需要你签字
I brought you this, because you need to have it signed,

293
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,600
而且你知道
And you know, I mean,

294
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:20,560
我不想给你惹麻烦
I don't want to cause any trouble for you.

295
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:21,900
好的  谢谢
Okay, thank you.

296
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:22,650
所以
So...

297
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:24,620
-我该从这边走吗  -对的
- So should I leave that way? - Yeah.

298
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:26,180
那样最好
That'd be great.

299
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,840
我放了个音响在我车里
I put one of those stereos in my car, man.

300
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:39,800
音效非常棒的
It sounds great.

301
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,170
-洛城警局 马上趴下
-洛城警局 特警队
- LAPD! Get on the ground now! - LAPD! SWAT!

302
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,650
-不许动 不许动 -已经控制
- Don't move! Don't move! - A Code 4 here!

303
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:45,600
右侧安全
Right side clear!

304
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:46,620
两两一组
Give me a two! ‭Two!

305
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:48,350
看起来是偷来的音响设备
Looks like stolen stereo equipment.

306
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:50,880
右侧安全 这里有个受伤的疑犯
Right side clear! Got a wounded suspect in here.

307
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:52,010
我来叫救援小组的
I'll get an R/A rolling.

308
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:54,090
让我来看看你的小黄脸
Let me see those pearly yellows.

309
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,150
把那东西从我脸上拿开
Get that thing out of my face.

310
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:56,770
-另外那家伙在哪 -不知道你说谁
- Where's the other guy? - Don't know no other guy.

311
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,090
那个逃跑的枪手 加布里埃尔
The shooter that got away, Gabriel.

312
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:01,050
轮到你说话了
It's time for you to talk.

313
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:01,910
去死吧
Go to hell.

314
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,690
还记得今天早上要杀的那个警察吗
Know the cop that you guys tried to kill this morning?

315
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:07,590
坏消息是他没死
The bad news is he's not dead.

316
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:10,460
更坏的消息是
他认出你是那个逃跑的司机
Worse news is, he just ID'd you as the getaway driver.

317
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:13,020
一个枪手死了
如果你是唯一一个上法庭的人
One shooter's dead, and if you're the only guy on trial...

318
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:14,160
我没有对警察开枪
I didn't shoot at no cop.

319
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,810
司机和那些开枪的人
The driver is just as responsible

320
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:17,030
一样都有罪
as the guys slinging the bullets,

321
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:19,350
除非你知道那个逃跑的枪手在哪
so unless you know where the missing shooter is...

322
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:23,960
迪亚高·佩雷斯
Diego Perez.

323
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:27,750
大块头 山羊胡
Big guy, goatee.

324
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:28,930
我昨晚接的他
I picked him up last night.

325
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:31,160
他是从维加斯来干活的
He came in from Vegas to pull the job.

326
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:32,080
职业杀手吗
Contract killer?

327
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,670
金想置身事外
Kim's trying to keep clean.

328
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:35,580
金 她是谁
Kim? Who's she?

329
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:39,760
他想杀了你
So he tries to kill you,

330
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,570
但我们还没有足够证据逮捕他
but we still don't have enough to make an arrest?

331
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:43,180
我们会找到证据的 KC 听着
We will, K.C. Listen.

332
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:45,500
金借走了2500万贷款
That $25 million dollar loan Kim took out,

333
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:46,760
我们可以从那里着手
there's something I can put into motion.

334
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:47,620
贷款
Loan?

335
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,870
我们得找到派克
We need to find Peck.

336
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,220
他有皮卡大道项目的文件
He's the one with the Pico Corridor papers.

337
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:53,810
那个东西能让金坐牢 保护卡尔文
That's what's gonna put Kim away and keep Calvin safe.

338
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:55,810
听着 别泄气 好吗 我让我的队员
Look, just hang tight, all right? I got the rest of my team

339
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:57,170
跟进这个案子 交给我们
working on this, let us do our thing.

340
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:01,320
已经发布了迪亚高·佩雷斯的全境通告
APB's out on Diego Perez,

341
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:01,900
还没消息
haven't gotten a hit yet.

342
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:04,590
他可能用了化名 或许我们可以让洛克
He's probably got an alias. Maybe we can get Rocker

343
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:06,500
等那个司机手术做完后给他施点压
to put some pressure on our driver once he's out of surgery.

344
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:08,790
我已经让你禁足了 你要去哪
I grounded you. Where you going?

345
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,910
打击帮派调查组
要我去法务部签一份声明
CAPO unit needs me to sign a statement over in Legal.

346
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:12,210
对  对  对  好吧
Ah, right, right, right, okay.

347
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,080
替我向马蒂问好
Well, give Marty my best.

348
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:15,370
弄完就回来
Then get back here.

349
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:25,350
来了
Hey, there he is.

350
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:26,660
感谢前来
Thanks for coming.

351
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:27,880
请坐
Have a seat.

352
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:30,300
关于那份文书...
About that paperwork...

353
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:33,180
打扰一下  女士
Excuse me, ma'am.

354
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:34,790
你是卡洛琳·肖恩吗
You Carolyn Shaw?

355
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:35,790
企业贷款的副总裁
VP of Corporate Loans?

356
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:36,840
您有什么事  警官
What's this about, Officer?

357
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:38,250
其实我是"警司"
It's, uh, "sergeant," Actually.

358
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:40,950
我想咨询下你们一位客户的情况 杰·金
I just have a question about your clients, Jae Kim.

359
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,700
如果你的银行准备给他贷款2500万
If your bank was to loan him 25 million,

360
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,480
需要你的签字 对吗
you'd be the one to sign off on it, right?

361
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,370
我不会讨论客户的信息
Well, I don't discuss individual clients...

362
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,790
听着 我本不应该告诉你的 但在你
Look, I shouldn't tell you this, but before you get

363
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:51,220
与杰·金有进一步合作前
more wrapped up in the Jae Kim business,

364
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:53,230
我觉得你应该知道他正在被调查
I think you should know he's under investigation.

365
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:55,080
调查什么
Investigation for what?

366
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:56,720
洗钱 走私毒品
Money laundering, drug trafficking,

367
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:58,820
企图谋杀警官 都是他的罪名
attempted murder of a police officer, take your pick.

368
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:01,500
我本不应该帮你
Now, I'm not supposed to do this favor for you.

369
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:03,320
我可能会为此惹上很多麻烦
I could really get in a lot of trouble warning you like this,

370
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:06,410
但我不想因为他的问题
让你的银行受到牵连
but I'd hate to see his problems drag your bank down with him.

371
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:08,470
难以置信 我刚准备
I can't believe it, I was just about to approve

372
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,750
对他的贷款批准展期
an extension on his loan payment.

373
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:12,610
我不是金融人士
但如果是我 我会三思的
Well, I'm no banker, but I'd think twice before you do that.

374
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:14,600
金会落网的
Kim's going down.

375
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:16,070
别说是我告诉你的
You didn't hear that from me.

376
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:17,380
谢谢你
Thank you.

377
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:18,560
祝你今天愉快
Have a nice day.

378
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:22,940
是我
Yeah, it's me.

379
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:26,510
你跟我说了...
You told me...

380
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:29,200
他看上去非常生气
He looks really pissed.

381
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:31,910
是啊 我猜他刚发现
Yeah, I'm guessing he's just found out he's gonna

382
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:33,710
他必须得在明早前还清贷款了
have to pay back that loan by tomorrow morning.

383
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,330
洪都下一步要怎么做
So what Hondo's next move?

384
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,010
请放下后车窗
Roll the back window down, please.

385
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:55,850
还记得我吗
You remember me?

386
00:15:58,150 --> 00:16:00,420
有次我开会不请自来的警官
The officer who dropped in on one of my meetings a while back.

387
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:01,430
我当然记得
Sure, I remember.

388
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:02,940
我一直没记住你的名字
I never did get your name.

389
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,890
反恐特警队的丹尼尔·哈里森
It's Daniel Harrelson, SWAT.

390
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,200
我很想知道你今天过得怎样
Just wondering how your day is going so far.

391
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,150
你真的不该
You really shouldn't meddle

392
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,490
搅和到别人的私事中去
in another person's private business.

393
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:15,810
是啊
或许你几个月前就该听取我的建议了
Yeah, maybe you should've taken your own advice four months ago.

394
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:17,280
我只想告诉你
I just want you to know,

395
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,530
下次咱俩见面时
the next time we see each other,

396
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:20,190
你就会带上手铐
you will be wearing cuffs.

397
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:23,820
好好享受你余下的日子
I hope you enjoy the time you have left.

398
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:32,390
派克的车有停车通行证
Peck's county car has a parking pass,

399
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:34,160
这座大楼也隶属于金旗下一家公司
and building's owned by one of Kim's LLCs.

400
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:35,230
他就是金的人
The guy's on Kim's payroll.

401
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,890
看起来哈里森警司发现了什么
Seems like Sergeant Harrelson was onto something.

402
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:42,620
是他吗
That him?

403
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:48,310
伊恩·派克 好吧 事情不妙
Ian Peck. Okay, that's not good.

404
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:50,260
房间里还有人
Somebody's still here.

405
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,190
KC
K.C.?

406
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:58,630
不
No.

407
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:01,760
我来的时候他就已经死了
I-I found him like that.

408
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:02,960
靠墙
Against the wall.

409
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:04,830
我准备报警的
I was gonna call it in,

410
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:06,340
就是还没机会...
I just hadn't had a chance to do...

411
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:07,380
-快  -等下
- Now. ‭- Wait a second.

412
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:08,630
怎么
What...?

413
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:22,210
派克跟踪你了吗 你是因为自卫杀了他吗
Did Peck come after you? Did you kill him in self-defense?

414
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,710
我们发现现场只有你和受害者
你也没有报警
You were found alone with the victim, you didn't call it in.

415
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:26,880
你非法闯入
You were there illegally.

416
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,450
我们还发现你在搜那个房间
We found you searching the place.

417
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,800
你怎么解释
How do you explain that?

418
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:32,500
我知道了他的地址 就去那找那些
I got his address, I went there to get the papers

419
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:35,520
他说能给杰·金定罪的文件
然后我就发现他已经死了
he said would incriminate Jae Kim and I found him dead.

420
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:37,700
我是要报警的 但我想先看看
I was gonna call it in, but I wanted to see

421
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:39,360
文件还在不在
if the paperwork was still there first.

422
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:41,100
我不该这么做的 但是
I shouldn't have done it, but...

423
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:47,240
-她没有杀他  -我理解
- She didn't kill him. ‭- I understand

424
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:49,190
你为什么相信她 但从表面看无法判定
why you believe that, but that's not how it looks.

425
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:51,510
是金刻意让KC偶然发现派克的住址的
Kim made sure K.C. came across Peck's address.

426
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,600
我不知道是用什么办法
And I don't know how,

427
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,670
但他想通过陷害她来警告我
but he set her up to get to me.

428
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:56,330
如果是这样 你和你的
If that's true, traipsing around L.A.

429
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:59,370
兼职女神探朋友在洛杉矶闲逛
with your moonlighting gal pal put her in that chair,

430
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:01,160
导致她如此下场
and got us no closer to nailing Kim

431
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:02,300
也并没有帮助我们给金定罪
than we were in the first place.

432
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:04,780
你清楚罪犯会是什么样
You know what guilty looks like,

433
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,030
你也清楚她没有杀那个人
and you know she didn't kill that guy.

434
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:08,290
我是凶案组的 我见过那么多悬案
I'm homicide. On the scale of mysteries,

435
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:09,160
这个的证据算很充分了
this isn't much of one.

436
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,700
沃尔什和尸体在案发现场同时被发现
Walsh was in the room with the body.

437
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:11,970
她为什么想杀派克
Why would she want to kill Peck?

438
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:14,190
他是我们扳倒金的关键证人
He was our key to taking Kim down.

439
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:16,650
你想证明是别人杀的吗 那就去证明
You want to prove it was someone else? Prove it was someone else.

440
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:19,140
我知道你觉得这个房地产商是幕后主使
I know you think this real estate guy is behind all this...

441
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:20,500
房地产只是个伪装
Real estate's his shell, man.

442
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:24,290
金掌控着市里最大的毒品交易
Kim oversees one of the biggest drug operations in the city.

443
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:27,360
一半的市领导都会在圣诞节给金寄贺卡
Half the civic leaders in town send Kim Christmas cards.

444
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:28,940
除了你的观点外
Need more than your opinion

445
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:30,170
还需要证据来扳倒这样的风云人物
to take on a guy that plugged in.

446
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,290
他说得对 我前几个小时接到了
He's right. I've never gotten calls like I have

447
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:33,120
有史以来最多的电话
in the past few hours.

448
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:34,110
-我也是  -谁打来的
- Me, either. - From who?

449
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:35,680
市里有头有脸的人
People with pull at City Hall.

450
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,790
拜托 这只是金请来
Oh, come on, that's just Kim calling in favors,

451
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:38,810
打压我的
trying to shut me down.

452
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:40,570
或者也许他觉得你对他有仇
Or maybe he feels like you got a vendetta,

453
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:43,040
没有按规矩办事
and haven't exactly been following the rules.

454
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:45,220
如果我给法务部的马蒂打个电话
If I give Marty in Legal a call,

455
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,950
他能证明你今天去过他的办公室了吗
is he gonna confirm that you stopped by his office earlier?

456
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,820
有人找借口我心里明白得很
I know when I'm getting the runaround.

457
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:53,610
你和沃尔什都是
From you and Walsh.

458
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:56,260
我就把话挑明了 在我们调查清楚前
So let me be clear: you're locked in the building

459
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,650
你都不准离开这栋大楼
till we get to the bottom of this.

460
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:03,930
我知道你和KC关系有多好
I know how close you are to K.C.,

461
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:05,890
但她已经卸下警徽了 洪都
but she doesn't have a badge anymore, Hondo.

462
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,310
所以我才得帮她
And that's why I needed to help her.

463
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:09,520
金一天不坐牢
就会让她和她儿子不得安宁
Kim being free is messing with her and her son--

464
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:10,880
他是我的干儿子
he's my godson.

465
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:12,370
你确定你没有违规
You sure no lines got crossed?

466
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:14,020
希克斯抓不住你的把柄
Nothing Hicks can get you for?

467
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,860
你是在问我犯罪了吗
Are you asking me if I got my hands dirty?

468
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:18,410
我觉得我非常清白
I think I kept them clean enough.

469
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,850
我以为我们能信任彼此
I thought we had trust.

470
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:24,190
为什么不告诉我你在做什么
Why didn't you tell me what you were doing?

471
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:25,600
我们确实能信任彼此
We do have trust.

472
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:28,020
或许我以为我是在保护你
Maybe I thought I was protecting you.

473
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:34,830
洛克确定吗
Rocker sure about this?

474
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,850
他说等协助逃逸的司机一醒来
Well, he said our getaway driver's amnesia lifted

475
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:39,570
发现自己被拷在床上失忆症就马上好了
as soon he woke up handcuffed to the bed.

476
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,590
我们第二个枪手用别名潜逃
And our second shooter's traveling under a different name.

477
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:42,750
但样貌没变 还是大块头 山羊胡
But still a big guy with a goatee?

478
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:45,440
大块头 山羊胡
还有一张去维加斯的车票
Big guy, goatee and a bus ticket to Vegas.

479
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:51,200
是那个吗
That our guy?

480
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:08,240
手背到身后
Give me your hands!

481
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:10,450
-手背到身后  -婊子
- Give me your hands. - Puta.

482
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:11,040
闭嘴
Shut up.

483
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:11,920
拷上了
Got him?

484
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:16,650
你觉得这里面有多少钱
How much do you think is in there?

485
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:18,260
-肯定有一万五  -两万
- Got to be 15 large. - 20.

486
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:20,010
这什么 现在谋杀警察的价格吗
What's that, the going rate for killing cops?

487
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:23,490
给 孩子
Here you go, kid.

488
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:30,250
你的脸怎么了
What happened to your face?

489
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:32,990
我只是出了个小车祸 没事
I just got in a little fender bender. It's nothing.

490
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,710
为什么警察来接我
Why'd the police come and pick me up?

491
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:36,630
我妈在里面干什么
What's my mom doing back there?

492
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,380
因为你祖母在科罗拉多
Well, since your grandmother's in Colorado,

493
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:40,500
所以在她回答一些问题的时候
your mom asked me to send a couple guys to pick you up

494
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:41,790
她叫我派几个人过去接你
while she answers a few questions.

495
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:42,580
我为什么不能见她
Why can't I see her?

496
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:44,870
只要她协助完我们查案 你就能见她了
As soon as she's done helping us with our case, you can.

497
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:46,490
-她不是退休了吗  -是的
- I thought she was retired. - She is.

498
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:49,020
但这起案子对你妈妈来说真的很重要
But this particular case is really important to your mom,

499
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,290
我们需要她的帮忙
and we need her help.

500
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:56,920
不如你别再和我玩
"20个问题"的游戏了
Hey, how about you quit with the 20 Questions,

501
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,310
给我点面子 开始看语法书吧
you make me look good and start your grammar.

502
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:01,190
你知道如果你妈妈觉得我让你偷懒
You know your mom's-a wring my neck

503
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:02,430
她会扭断我的脖子的
if she thinks I'm letting you slack.

504
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:03,920
吃东西
And eat.

505
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:05,450
快吃
Eat.

506
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:09,390
你这个教父做得挺不错的嘛
You're a hell of a godfather.

507
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:12,280
这孩子很听话
Kid makes it easy.

508
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,580
我们有什么能帮他的吗
Is there anything we can do for him?

509
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:15,330
在我们想到办法
如何帮KC摆脱这件事之前
Just keep it a regular day until we figure out

510
00:21:15,330 --> 00:21:16,680
就当没事发生就行了
how to get K.C. out of this.

511
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,800
说到这个 跟我来
Speaking of that, come with me.

512
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:27,610
洪都 我听说了你的事 很高兴你没事
Hondo, I heard what happened. I'm glad you're okay.

513
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:29,080
谢谢你  警监
I appreciate that, Commissioner.

514
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:31,960
几个月前 迈克尔接到杰·金的电话
A few months ago, Michael got a call from Jae Kim.

515
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:33,700
他说有一名特警队警官
He said a SWAT officer showed up

516
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:36,270
出现在投资者会议上 说了一些过分的话
at an investor meeting and stepped over the line.

517
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,630
金说他觉得被人恐吓
Kim said he felt threatened,

518
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:39,730
叫我去调查有关情况
asked me to look into the situation.

519
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:42,530
我和金说
如果他去找KC·沃尔什或她儿子
I told Kim if he came after K.C. Walsh or her son again,

520
00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:43,550
我就会去找他
I was gonna pay him a visit.

521
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:45,980
仅此而已
Nothing more to the situation.

522
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:46,950
你确定吗
Are you sure?

523
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:49,020
因为当我打电话给缉毒组时
'Cause when I checked in with Narcotics,

524
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:50,870
他们说你也和他们闹得很激烈
they said you got pretty heated with them, too.

525
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:52,470
是因为他们没有扳倒杰·金
For not taking Jae Kim down.

526
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:55,730
所以我再见到金的时候 他说
So when I spoke to Kim again, he said...

527
00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:58,590
等一下 再见到 什么时候
Wait a minute. Again? When?

528
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,650
等等 是因为你 金才知道我过去几个月
Hold up, are you the reason Kim knew I was looking into him

529
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:03,850
一直在调查他吗
所以我今天才遭遇枪击吗
for the past couple of months? The reason I got shot at today?

530
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:06,340
我不是有意的 如果真的有调查
That's not what I intended. I never would've spoken to Kim

531
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:08,350
我是绝对不会和金说
if there was an actual investigation,

532
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:10,330
但是显然那是你和前联邦探员
but apparently this was you and an ex-federal agent

533
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:11,390
私下在调查
looking into things on your own?

534
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,230
这我可不知道
I didn't know about it.

535
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:14,620
你怎么会知道 你坐镇监督委员会
Why should you? You sit on an oversight board.

536
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:15,620
又不用出外勤
You don't work in the field.

537
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:16,930
那也不代表你可以走进委员会办公室
Doesn't mean you get to walk into a boardroom

538
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:18,730
-去恐吓人  -我没恐吓他
- and threaten someone. - I didn't threaten him.

539
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:19,600
我认识当时委员会里的一些人
I know a some people who were there.

540
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,060
在他们看来那就是恐吓
Sounded like threats to them.

541
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,510
我知道你很聪明 不会违反规章制度
I know you're smart enough not to break the rules,

542
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:24,730
但是别告诉我 你没有触犯纪律
but don't tell me you didn't bend them here.

543
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:27,210
杰·金是绑架十岁小男孩的幕后黑手
Jae Kim was behind the kidnapping of a ten-year-old boy.

544
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:28,580
如果你能证明这点 他早就入狱了
If you could prove that, he'd be behind bars.

545
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:29,140
或许他只是有很多
Or maybe he just has

546
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:31,570
像你这样的朋友去帮他掩盖罪行
too many friends like you covering his ass.

547
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:33,000
少来了 警监
Come on, Commissioner.

548
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,280
不要假装你没听说过
Don't even try to play like you haven't heard

549
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,640
金不干不净的谣言
the rumors of Kim being dirty.

550
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,150
我们过去有过一些来往
We've had a few business dealings in the past,

551
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:38,590
但我们不是朋友
but we're hardly friends.

552
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:40,110
至于谣言 也就是谣言
As for rumors, they're rumors.

553
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,140
想要改变架构
You try working in construction

554
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:43,240
却又不想和有点小问题的人打交道
without dealing with someone who's a little questionable.

555
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:44,760
那你是什么也打造不出来的
You'd never build anything.

556
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,210
我唯一想在这里打造的是 长官
The only thing I'm trying to build here, sir...

557
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:47,720
你们俩都别说了
Both of you need to stop.

558
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:51,190
迈克尔 金想杀死洪都
Michael, Kim tried to have Hondo killed.

559
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:54,890
洪都 迈克尔不是敌人 我们要达成共识
Hondo, Michael's not the enemy. We need to get on the same page.

560
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:56,390
什么样的共识
Yeah, and what page is that?

561
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:05,990
你认得他吗
You recognize him?

562
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:07,500
凭空冒出一袋钱
Bag of cash came from somewhere.

563
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:08,770
要告诉我们是谁付给你的吗
Want to tell us who paid you?

564
00:23:08,770 --> 00:23:10,310
没干完活还有这么好的收益
Nice profit for an unfinished job.

565
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,050
是谁叫你干掉我的
Who asked you to take me out?

566
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:14,390
我认得你
I recognize you.

567
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:16,830
你拔出一把西格绍尔P228制式手枪
You pulled a SIG P228.

568
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:20,920
想干掉警察时 你就倒大霉了
Life gets real bad when you go at a cop,

569
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:24,520
但是你很走运 我只想抓到雇佣你的人
but lucky for you, I just want the guy who hired you.

570
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:28,080
我不认识他 从来也没和他说过话
I don't know him. Never talked to the guy.

571
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,940
这样可不行啊 迪亚戈
Well, that's not good enough, Diego.

572
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:32,980
看来你要替所有的人坐牢了 我们走
Looks like you're gonna do time for everybody on this. Let's go.

573
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:36,670
听着 你们想要抓到那个人吗
Look, listen, look. You want the guy?

574
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:37,810
你抓到了
All right, you got him.

575
00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:40,250
显然你们已经知道名字了 那你告诉我
Now you obviously got a name, so go ahead and tell me

576
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:42,660
你希望我重复说给谁听 我都照做
and I'll repeat it to whoever you want me to.

577
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:46,260
在我耳边悄悄告诉我
Whisper a name in my ear.

578
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:53,120
警察可不是这么办事的
That's not how we do things here.

579
00:23:57,330 --> 00:23:59,800
听说迪亚戈不愿供出金
Hey. Heard Diego wouldn't give Kim up.

580
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:00,400
是不能
Couldn't.

581
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,400
金做好了多层保护措施 以自保清白
Kim put enough layers between 'em to keep him in the clear.

582
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,830
那为什么这个杀手还有钱收呢
So why'd this hitman still get paid?

583
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:05,280
因为他把目标转向了伊恩·派克
'Cause he changed his target to Ian Peck.

584
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,370
如果迪亚戈杀了派克
If Diego killed Peck,

585
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:07,870
就是说KC就能脱身了吧
that means K.C.'s off the hook, right?

586
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:08,940
他们正在给他做笔录
They're getting him on the record now,

587
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:10,320
但是没错 应该会释放KC的
but yeah, K.C. should get released.

588
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:13,360
太好了 我们能聊两句吗
Great. Hey, could we talk for a sec?

589
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,170
说吧
Shoot.

590
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:19,530
我妈出狱后就一直住在我家
So my mom's staying with me since she got out,

591
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:21,970
一切都很好 但既然我是警察
and everything's great, but since I'm a cop,

592
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:24,980
就要填表格 也就是走走形式
there's this form. It's kind of a formality.

593
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:26,110
我只是需要上级的同意
I just need approval.

594
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:30,150
和重罪犯住在一起 可不是走走形式
To live with a felon. It's not a formality.

595
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:32,520
想得美
Nice try.

596
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:34,010
那你不会帮我签字吗
So you're not gonna sign for me?

597
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:38,520
就像安妮和孩子们说的
Look, like Annie tells the kids,

598
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,580
不要兜兜转转走冤枉路
don't take three rights to make a left.

599
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,720
这需要你的上级来签
Your superior officer needs to sign it.

600
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,260
直接去找洪都吧
That's Hondo.

601
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:52,070
你听说过钱德勒俱乐部吗
Have you heard of the Chandler Club?

602
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:55,180
市中心那家只对会员开放的酒吧
Yeah, that's that members-only lounge downtown.

603
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:56,610
洛杉矶那些土得掉渣的富二代
Old money L.A. dinosaurs.

604
00:24:56,610 --> 00:24:58,310
暴发户也可以加入 金是那里的会员
New money, too. Kim's a member.

605
00:24:58,310 --> 00:24:59,770
他刚刚在俱乐部订了一个房间
He just booked a room at the club

606
00:24:59,770 --> 00:25:01,310
向阿尔瓦拉多的投资者
to pitch some high-end development

607
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:03,080
推销一些高端开发项目
on Alvarado to investors.

608
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:05,650
那笔2500百万的贷款明天就到期
Oh, okay, so that $25 million loan's due tomorrow,

609
00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:07,740
他出去找摇钱树 想要找点现金
and he's out shaking the tree trying to find some cash.

610
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:10,530
他急需钱 也许我们可以趁机抓到他
He's desperate. Maybe we can turn that into a bust.

611
00:25:10,530 --> 00:25:11,330
怎么做
How?

612
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:13,060
迈克尔·普兰克有邀请函
Michael Plank got an invitation.

613
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:16,210
普兰克 不不 绝对不行 我不相信他
Plank-- No, no. Hell no. I don't trust him.

614
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:17,140
我相信
Well, I do.

615
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:22,580
似乎金每几年都会把同样的六处房产
Looks like Kim rotates the same six properties

616
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:24,590
在其多个公司间流转
among his LLCs every few years.

617
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:25,800
在法庭上还是没法证明这点
I still can't prove it in court,

618
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,610
但他在为贩毒集团洗钱
but he is laundering money for a cartel.

619
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:29,710
房产只是用来隐藏毒品利润的方式
The real estate's just a way of hiding the drug profits.

620
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:32,010
不然这些资金注入就解释不通了
These cash injections make no sense otherwise.

621
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:33,430
他的公司靠的是沙土[根基不稳]
Company's built on sand.

622
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:34,770
靠的是芬太尼
It's built on fentanyl.

623
00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:36,990
感谢你给我机会证明我能帮忙
Appreciate you giving me the chance to show you I can help here.

624
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,430
你可以谢谢科尔特斯
You can thank Cortez.

625
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:40,830
警监  你想帮忙吗
Commissioner, you want to help?

626
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:42,810
但是这有可能会很危险
Could come with some real danger, though.

627
00:25:42,810 --> 00:25:45,060
上次他追杀那孩子 今天来追杀我
He went after a kid last time and me today.

628
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:48,660
当我在军械库被人劫持的时候
When I got taken hostage in this armory,

629
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:50,720
你的直觉帮忙救了我一命
your gut instinct helped save my life.

630
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,320
如果你对金的直觉是对的
If your gut's right about Kim,

631
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,610
我就可以帮忙抓到他 那就是我想做的
and I can help take him down, then that's what I want to do.

632
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:57,380
你们需要我做些什么
What do you need me to do?

633
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:01,000
不需要给他设套
Without entrapping him,

634
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:03,020
我要你让金承认这个开发项目
I need you to get Kim to admit that this development

635
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:05,140
只是一个洗黑钱的骗局
is just a sham for washing dirty money.

636
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:06,140
我是一名警监
I'm a police commissioner.

637
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:07,330
你们为什么觉得他会向我承认
Why do you think he'd admit that to me?

638
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:08,350
他也许不会
He might not,

639
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,940
但在他追杀我之前 他相信你
but he trusted you before when it came to me.

640
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:12,990
你是那个房间里对他来说最有用的人
You're gonna be one of the richest men in the room.

641
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:14,680
金急需2500万美金
Kim needs $25 million quick.

642
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:17,940
测试一下麦克风
Test the microphone.

643
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:18,770
一二
One-two.

644
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:22,420
我都感觉不到麦克风的存在
Wow. I can't even feel it's there.

645
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:24,620
别这样扭动你的领带 很不自然
Don't touch your tie like that, it's unnatural.

646
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:26,600
一表现不自然就会暴露你的身份
Unnatural is how covers get blown.

647
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,970
只要让他感觉自在 金很有可能会说一些
Kim's gonna be more likely to say something incriminating

648
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:29,950
能证明他有罪的话
if he's comfortable.

649
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:31,140
让他主动来找你
Let him come to you.

650
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:33,310
普兰克警监
Commissioner Plank.

651
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,620
很高兴你来了
Glad you came.

652
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:36,120
跨年在纳帕谷没见到你
Missed you in Napa over New Year's.

653
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,340
我在杰克逊霍尔
Jackson Hole for me.

654
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:39,700
过年不下雪总感觉不对
The holidays just seem wrong without snow.

655
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,270
-失陪了  -请便
‭- Excuse me. - Yeah.

656
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:44,600
我们队就在附近 如果他说漏嘴
Our team will be nearby, ready to go

657
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,680
或者事情有变 我们随时出动
if he slips or if things go sideways.

658
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,160
-事情有变  -有可能
- Sideways? ‭- It can happen.

659
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:50,210
所以我的队伍就在屋外的后巷里
So my team's gonna be right outside in the back alley.

660
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:52,430
我们派了克里斯卧底保护你
We'll send Chris undercover for your protection.

661
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:53,950
要是他发现我带窃听器了呢
What if he figures out I'm wearing a wire?

662
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:55,440
不会的 他会相信你
He won't. He's gonna want to believe you.

663
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,750
你只要不想着你带了 就不会露馅
Just forget you're wearing one and you won't screw up.

664
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:58,790
失陪了
Excuse me.

665
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:01,740
他要开始了
He's about to start.

666
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:02,820
试试能不能凑近点
See if you can get closer.

667
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:04,010
各位请听我说
Excuse me, folks.

668
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:08,150
谢谢你们这么快赶来
Thank you for coming on short notice.

669
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,650
我可以保证
阿尔瓦拉多的房地产开发项目
I can assure you the property development

670
00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:12,530
绝对值得各位花时间好好了解
on Alvarado is well worth your time.

671
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:13,860
-你们中有一些人也许还没听说...
-来一杯吗  先生
- For those of you who haven't heard... - ‭Wine, sir?

672
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:14,980
我在中国的投资人
...my investor in China ran into

673
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:18,030
因为政府管控遇到了流动性问题
liquidity problems after a government crackdown.

674
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:19,110
其结果是
The result is

675
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:23,530
我必须在明天之前
转让他价值2500万的股份
I have to replace his $25 million share by tomorrow.

676
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:25,740
我知道这听起来有点风险
I realize it sounds aggressive.

677
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:27,370
我可以让各位匿名加入
I'll let you in on a secret.

678
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:31,200
现在这些股份已经价值4000万
This share is a $40 million value.

679
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:33,320
情况很微妙
I'm in a delicate situation.

680
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:37,120
我给各位朋友们
提供一个一生难得的机会
I'm offering a once in a lifetime deal to my friends.

681
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:40,970
那么请吧 尽情开怀畅饮 看一看介绍
So please, have a drink, check the specs.

682
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:42,900
我会到各处为各位答疑
I'll circle around.

683
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:46,250
幸会
Hey, good to see you.

684
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,500
迈克尔
Michael.

685
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:52,940
你认识我们之前提到过的那位警官吗
You know that police officer we discussed?

686
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:55,340
他今天又不请自来了
Paid me another uninvited visit today.

687
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:57,740
他对我的错误印象真的很严重
‭He really does have quite the wrong impression of me.

688
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:59,020
我跟他的指挥官交情不错 我会让她
I'm friendly with his commander. I'll get her

689
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:00,480
确保他不再来骚扰你
to make sure he leaves you alone.

690
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,130
专注他的本职工作
Focuses on his real job.

691
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,290
谢谢你
Thank you.

692
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:04,460
我说实话
I got to be honest.

693
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:06,070
投资阿尔瓦拉多
Buying a stake in Alvarado...

694
00:28:06,650 --> 00:28:07,560
我有点兴趣
I'm intrigued.

695
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,650
你的确应该有兴趣
You should be intrigued.

696
00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:09,980
短时间要拿出这么一笔钱是有点多
It's an awful lot on short notice,

697
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:13,430
但是谁不想用钱生钱呢
but who wouldn't want to turn 25 into 40?

698
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:16,120
只是有一件事我想确认下
Just one thing I'm not sure about.

699
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:18,930
我可以让你匿名投资 没有问题 迈克尔
I'd have no problem letting you invest anonymously, Michael.

700
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:20,090
不 这不是问题
No, that's not a problem.

701
00:28:20,090 --> 00:28:21,720
我们拿得下他吗
Are we gonna get this guy or what?

702
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,770
他好像以为迈克尔上钩了
He seems to think he has Michael on the hook.

703
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:25,510
如果你还想再谈谈条款
If better terms are what you want...

704
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:26,710
条款没问题
The terms are fine.

705
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,900
是你的中国投资人的问题
It's your Chinese investor.

706
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:32,180
你说的这个故事有些地方讲不通
Something doesn't quite add up with that story.

707
00:28:33,190 --> 00:28:34,630
我不介意冒点风险
I don't mind taking risks,

708
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:37,880
但是我想知道真实情况
but I just need to know the real deal.

709
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:40,730
你告诉我 我就给钱
You tell me that, I can get you the money.

710
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:48,000
也许我们这次还是不要合作了
Maybe we wouldn't be good partners in this.

711
00:28:49,610 --> 00:28:50,910
我要去到处走走了
I really should make the rounds.

712
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,190
失陪了 警监
Excuse me, Commissioner.

713
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:54,800
他差点上钩了
He had him.

714
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,530
-怎么回事  -他太直接了
- What happened? ‭- He was too direct.

715
00:28:56,530 --> 00:28:58,060
又或者他是故意谈崩的
Or he blew it on purpose.

716
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:00,210
让平民去做警察的工作
Got a civilian doing a cop's job,

717
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:01,160
就会是这种结果
that's what happened.

718
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,420
我们没有选择的余地
We didn't have a choice.

719
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,750
你快离开这里吧
We should get you out of here.

720
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:05,390
-我要再去找他谈谈 -不行 迈克尔
- I got to talk to him again. - No, Michael.

721
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:06,170
你该走了
It's time to go.

722
00:29:06,170 --> 00:29:07,620
门就在你身后迈克尔
Door's right behind you, Michael.

723
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:08,950
再给我一次机会
Just give me one more shot.

724
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:10,920
指挥部要求你离开 警监
HQ wants you out, Commissioner.

725
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:13,070
你先走 我随后就来
You duck out first. I'll be right behind you.

726
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:19,510
各位
Excuse me, everyone.

727
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:21,400
各位请听我说
If I can have your attention?

728
00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:23,100
他在干什么
What is he doing?

729
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:24,680
我想举杯说几句
Love to offer a toast.

730
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:26,830
杰
Jae...

731
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:30,880
你是洛杉矶房地产业最后的巨擘之一
you're one of the last true titans of L.A. real estate.

732
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,540
你在这里赚得盆满钵满
You've made millions in this town.

733
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:35,480
有人说你带来的回报更是不计其数
Some would say you've given even more back.

734
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:36,970
他们错了
They'd be wrong.

735
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,410
你知道阿尔瓦拉多的项目
不可能带来收益
You know Alvarado won't turn a profit.

736
00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:41,770
是不会盈利的
It can't.

737
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:44,080
它的价值不到其评估值的一半
It's worth less than half of its assessment.

738
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:45,240
你说你上个月
You said this property

739
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,300
不费吹灰之力就购入了这片地产
fell into your lap last month,

740
00:29:47,330 --> 00:29:49,320
可你忘了提你是从谁那里买到的
but you failed to mention who you bought it from.

741
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:51,320
你自己
Yourself.

742
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:52,750
真的吗
Really?

743
00:29:53,090 --> 00:29:54,410
你就是个骗子
You're a con man.

744
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,710
我不知道你是不是喝多了
I don't know if you've had too much to drink...

745
00:30:03,650 --> 00:30:05,560
我的过往业绩有目共睹
My track record speaks for itself.

746
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:07,070
那就看大家相信你还是相信我了
It's your word against mine.

747
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:11,860
给你投资就是让自己的钱打水漂
Whoever invests with you is throwing away their money.

748
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:24,690
这策略不错  警监
Nice pivot, Commissioner.

749
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:25,980
谢了
Thanks.

750
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:27,370
我知道我搞砸了 所以我想
I knew I blew the sting, so I figured

751
00:30:27,370 --> 00:30:28,540
至少我可以阻止金筹钱
the least I could do was stop Kim

752
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:30,170
这样他就还不清那笔贷款了
from raising the money to pay that loan back.

753
00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:31,230
金不跟你谈的时候
After Kim stopped talking,

754
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:33,100
-我以为就这么没戏了 -我也是
- I thought it was over. - Yeah, me, too.

755
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:35,180
我就是没法看着别人
被他的花言巧语哄骗
I just couldn't let Kim sweet-talk someone else

756
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:36,510
给他递上一张支票
into handing him a check.

757
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:39,180
所以我就想警告下大家
So, figured I'd poison the well for everyone there,

758
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:41,200
切断他的保命财路
cut off any financial escape route.

759
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,080
抓不了他 至少让他不好过
Can't bust him, at least keep him desperate.

760
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:45,930
你现在跟洪都一样 成了活靶子了
Target's on your back now, too. Same as Hondo.

761
00:30:45,930 --> 00:30:47,670
我这条命 就指望你们这些专家
Counting on the pros to prove he's a criminal

762
00:30:47,670 --> 00:30:48,700
来证明他有罪了
before it comes to that.

763
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:51,410
金肯定会垂死挣扎到底 巴罗斯
Well, Kim's gonna fight to the end. Burrows.

764
00:30:51,410 --> 00:30:52,780
那个任由帮他们逃跑的司机
The Profetas that let our getaway driver

765
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:55,330
在床上血流不止的先知帮 他们在哪里
bleed all over their mattress-- where are they now?

766
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:57,180
为什么又叫我过来
So, why'd you bring me back here?

767
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:59,470
我说了我不知道他们开枪杀警察
I told you I had no idea they shot a cop.

768
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:01,410
你们开始偷音响之前
Before you started lifting stereos... ‭

769
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:02,890
先知帮是那个芬太尼赌窝的
...Profetas were the main distributors

770
00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:04,160
主要贩卖商
for a fentanyl operation.

771
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:06,910
不过你们的生意几个月前泡汤了 对吧
Only business went south a few months ago. Am I right?

772
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:08,620
货没了
Supply dried up, man.

773
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:10,540
杰·金的货
Jae Kim's supply.

774
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:12,620
对
Right.

775
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:14,810
我有个奇妙的感觉
I got a funny little feeling

776
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:16,360
供货的口子又要开了
the spigot's about to open up again,

777
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:18,460
所以我需要你告诉我时间和地点
so I need you to tell me when and where.

778
00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:21,710
我告诉你 就可以自由地离开这里吗
I do that, and I walk out of here a free man?

779
00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:23,060
像鸟儿一样自由
Free as a bird.

780
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,640
也许需要打几个电话
Might have to make a few phone calls.

781
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,260
那我们就给你找一部电话
Well, let's get you a phone, then.

782
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:33,980
码头旁边有一个装卸区
There's a shipping yard right next to the port.

783
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:35,210
有交易要发生
Something's going down right now.

784
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:36,590
大毒贩名叫格拉索
Big dealer named Grasso.

785
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:38,220
阿明·格拉索 亚美尼亚人
Armin Grasso. Little Armenia.

786
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:39,560
就是他 他想做芬太尼买卖
That's the one. I guess he's been trying

787
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,530
已经有一段时间了
to tap into the fentanyl market for a while.

788
00:31:41,530 --> 00:31:42,690
今晚他有机会了
Just got his chance tonight.

789
00:31:42,690 --> 00:31:44,220
金要出手了 他要把过去几个月
Kim's making his move. He's unloading

790
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:45,640
存着的他用来赚快钱的
his entire supply he's been sitting on

791
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,220
库存全部清掉
the past few months for fast cash.

792
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:48,080
量会很大
That's got to be huge.

793
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,650
价值2500万的芬太尼吗
Like, $25 million worth of fentanyl?

794
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:51,170
可能还不止 而且金
Probably more. And there's no way

795
00:31:51,170 --> 00:31:53,860
一定会亲自到场监督交易
Kim won't be there personally to oversee this exchange.

796
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:54,790
出发
Let's move.

797
00:31:57,350 --> 00:31:58,260
你不能跟我们去
You can't come with us.

798
00:31:58,260 --> 00:31:59,120
为什么不能
Like hell I can't.

799
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:00,080
希克斯不准你出门
Hicks has you grounded.

800
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,430
我回头再请他原谅
I'll beg for forgiveness later.

801
00:32:01,430 --> 00:32:04,970
我们的目标是抓住金 
而不是连带你停职甚至更糟
The goal is to bust Kim, not bust Kim and get you suspended. Or worse.

802
00:32:04,970 --> 00:32:06,840
拿下金的时候我必须在场
I'm gonna be there when we take Kim down.

803
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,580
他追杀我的朋友
He went after my friend.

804
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:11,960
他也追杀了我们的朋友 就是你
He went after our friend, too. You.

805
00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:13,760
听着 我们可以的
Look, we got this covered.

806
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,360
不要冒险毁了诉讼
Let's not risk prosecution.

807
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:16,670
没事的 洪都
Come on, Hondo.

808
00:32:16,930 --> 00:32:18,090
我们能抓到他
We got him.

809
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:19,630
我们会扳倒金的
We're gonna take Kim down.

810
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:20,380
绝不手软
All the way.

811
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:22,350
换我们中的任何一个人
你也会挺身而出的
You'd do the same thing for any one of us.

812
00:32:24,690 --> 00:32:25,810
去吧  去吧
Go. Go.

813
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:40,960
听到了吗
Hear that?

814
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:49,390
那两辆车有动静吗
Anything from the two vehicles?

815
00:32:49,390 --> 00:32:51,500
-没有  -金呢 他出现了吗
- Not a peep. - What about Kim? He show his face?

816
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:52,990
-还没有  -他很狡猾
- Not yet. - He's slippery.

817
00:32:52,990 --> 00:32:53,940
如果他不出现
If he doesn't show up to this,

818
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:55,040
我们就没法抓他
we got nothing on him.

819
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,230
继续盯着 右边车里
Keep looking. Three guys

820
00:32:56,230 --> 00:32:57,240
有三个人
in the truck on the right,

821
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,400
左边车里有两个人
two in the car on the left.

822
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,500
都盯紧了
We got 'em both covered.

823
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:01,150
谭 和指挥部之间的联络怎么样
Tan, how we doing on that line to HQ?

824
00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:02,610
应该马上就好
Should be up in a minute.

825
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:06,430
有动静
We got movement.

826
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,230
有人看到杰·金了吗
Anyone see Jae Kim?

827
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,320
没有
Nope.

828
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:31,730
看到他了
Got him.

829
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:45,380
去把车门打开
Go ahead. Open it up.

830
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:56,170
记住 在金达成交易之前
Remember, we don't have anything

831
00:33:56,170 --> 00:33:57,830
我们没有关于他的任何把柄
on Kim until he makes a deal.

832
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,450
他一点头 我们就上
The second he gives a nod, we pounce.

833
00:33:59,450 --> 00:34:01,000
这地方很可能会爆炸 准备好
This place might explode, so be ready.

834
00:34:01,010 --> 00:34:02,870
-我们准备好了 老大  -我知道
- We're all over it, boss. - I know you are.

835
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:04,060
来了
Okay, here we go.

836
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,770
怎么回事 他们要取消吗
What is this? They're calling it off?

837
00:34:07,770 --> 00:34:08,770
卢卡 听到什么了吗
Luca, you hear anything?

838
00:34:08,770 --> 00:34:10,710
没有 声音太小了 而且我高中
No, whispers are too low, and they didn't

839
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:12,710
也不学亚美尼亚语
teach Armenian at my high school.

840
00:34:14,370 --> 00:34:15,870
这些家伙要么是要进行交易
These guys are either about to make a deal,

841
00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:17,640
要么这地方要炸了
or this place is about to go off.

842
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:31,570
那里至少有2500万 好了
That's $25 million at least. Here we go.

843
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:33,380
除非确认交易 否则我们不能上
We can't move in unless there's a confirmation.

844
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:34,590
握手就行了
A handshake will do.

845
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:36,990
说定了吗
So, do we have a deal?

846
00:34:39,970 --> 00:34:41,210
说定了
Yeah, we got a deal.

847
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:43,320
上
Go! Now!

848
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,290
上  上
Move in! Move in!

849
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:45,520
抓到了  上
We got him! Go!

850
00:34:46,270 --> 00:34:47,400
洛杉矶警局
LAPD! ‭

851
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,960
不许动 洛杉矶警局
Freeze! LAPD!

852
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:51,550
-举起手来  -去车边
- Hands up! - ‭Get to the car!

853
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:52,720
-警察  -上
- Police! - Get on him!

854
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:53,580
洛杉矶警局
LAPD! ‭

855
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,450
放下武器
Drop your weapons now!

856
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:56,820
趴下
On the ground!

857
00:34:57,690 --> 00:34:58,670
我去抓金
I got Kim!

858
00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:02,040
下车  立刻
Out of the car! Now!

859
00:35:38,330 --> 00:35:39,450
我抓到他了 洪都
I got him, Hondo.

860
00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:40,490
我抓到他了
I got him.

861
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,940
把他抓回来
Bring his ass in.

862
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,700
你好啊 坦纳
Hey. What's up, Tanner?

863
00:36:12,810 --> 00:36:14,040
等等  怎么了
Wait, what's going on?

864
00:36:19,130 --> 00:36:20,650
杰克逊街633号
633 Jackson Street.

865
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:21,830
嗯  我知道
Yeah, I know it.

866
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:25,790
好的 伙计 我马上到
All right, man. I'll be right there.

867
00:36:41,810 --> 00:36:43,760
感觉很不错吧
Feels nice, doesn't it?

868
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:45,440
不仅仅只是不错
Better than nice.

869
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:49,360
他这种级别的大犯
可不是每天都能遇上的
Don't send his kind away too often.

870
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:50,970
这种人也不会被关太久
When we do, they don't usually stay there.

871
00:36:50,970 --> 00:36:52,730
我感觉他会被关挺久
I have a feeling this one will stick.

872
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:03,040
-伙计  -邻居看到有人擅闯
- Hey, man. - Neighbor saw a trespasser.

873
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,610
我到了以后看到有人从窗户里爬出来
When I got here, I saw a figure climbing out the window.

874
00:37:05,610 --> 00:37:06,740
发现她躲在草丛里
Found her hiding in the bushes.

875
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:07,980
谢谢你先联系我
Thanks for calling me first, man.

876
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:09,610
我们是应该把抓到的人
We're really supposed to take anyone we find

877
00:37:09,610 --> 00:37:10,800
带回警局
around here into the station.

878
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,000
这片你也很熟 对大家都不好
You know this area. No one's up to any good.

879
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,330
不会再发生这种事了
It's not gonna happen again.

880
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,190
我们不该再这样让你走后门了
We're really not supposed to cut corners anymore.

881
00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:17,750
-别让我因为这个引火烧身 -不会的
- Don't let me get burned for this, man. ‭- You won't.

882
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:18,940
不会的  我保证
You won't. I promise.

883
00:37:19,090 --> 00:37:19,940
好吧
All right.

884
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:21,310
谢了
Thanks.

885
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:54,950
你为什么要回来这里 妈妈
Why'd you come back here, Mom?

886
00:37:57,390 --> 00:37:59,220
我得拿点东西
I had to get something.

887
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,320
我见过这个
I've seen this before.

888
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,720
这是我妈妈除了她的坏脾气以外
Only thing I ever got from my mother,

889
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:08,220
唯一留给我的东西
except the temper.

890
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:10,550
你爸爸和我吵得厉害时
When things got bad with your dad and me,

891
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:13,720
我只是...
我只是觉得有个退路会很好
I just... I thought it would be smart to have an exit strategy.

892
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:15,950
所以我就把这个藏在了地板下
然后...
So I hid it under the floorboards. And...

893
00:38:15,950 --> 00:38:18,840
之前我都没法回来 直到今天 所以...
Just... I couldn't get back here until today, so...

894
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:22,900
我要当掉这个 这样
I-I'm gonna pawn it, so that, you know,

895
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:27,090
在我找到工作之前
你就不用一直负担我的花销
you don't have to cover all my expenses until I get a job.

896
00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:33,490
这里面有很多回忆
A lot of memories in there.

897
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:35,910
你想进去看看吗
You want to go inside?

898
00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:36,770
不
No.

899
00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:43,740
我从来没想让你这么快长大 吉米
I never, ever meant for you to have to grow up so fast, Jimmy.

900
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:45,810
真的  我是说
I didn't. I mean,

901
00:38:45,810 --> 00:38:47,880
你爸爸的确不是好人 但
your father was no good, but...

902
00:38:48,830 --> 00:38:50,850
有时候我也不好
neither was I, sometimes.

903
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,400
对不起 对不起
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

904
00:38:58,090 --> 00:38:59,160
没关系
It's okay.

905
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,720
现在都好多了
Things are better now.

906
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,850
我的问题都答对了
I answered every question right,

907
00:39:10,850 --> 00:39:13,360
但是他们还是不要我去上班
but they didn't want me for that job.

908
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:19,810
我不知道我该怎么办了
I don't know how I'm gonna make it out here.

909
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:40,930
冠军
Hey, champ.

910
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,190
-你还好吗  -嗯
- How you doing? You good? - Yeah.

911
00:39:44,690 --> 00:39:45,600
听着
Hey, listen.

912
00:39:47,370 --> 00:39:48,790
我要告诉你一些事
I want to tell you something,

913
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,930
你要保证你会永远记得我说的话
and you got to promise you'll always remember.

914
00:39:51,010 --> 00:39:51,720
我保证
Promise.

915
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:52,490
好
Okay.

916
00:39:53,070 --> 00:39:54,350
你这辈子会听到一个词
There's a word that you're gonna hear

917
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:56,260
很多很多遍
that gets thrown around a lot in life.

918
00:39:56,810 --> 00:39:57,790
"英雄"
"Hero."

919
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:59,950
这个词已经流传了好几年
Now, it's been watered down over the years.

920
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:03,380
这是用来描述那些说了好听话的人
It's something we say when somebody gives a good speech

921
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:06,170
或者屁股中弹的人
or when somebody gets shot in the butt.

922
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:09,760
但是当一个人不计回报地
‭But, listen, when a person sticks with something for months

923
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:12,270
专注于一件事好几个月
and doesn't care if they never get any credit for it

924
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:14,520
或者就算不是自己的错
or isn't afraid to take the heat

925
00:40:14,650 --> 00:40:16,340
也愿意背负责任
even though it's not their fault,

926
00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:18,900
那才是真正的英雄
that's a real hero.

927
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:23,740
你妈妈就是那样的人
And that's exactly what your mom is.

928
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:25,670
-你明白吗  -嗯
- You understand? - ‭Yeah.

929
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:27,810
很好  去告诉她吧
Good. Go let her know.

930
00:40:33,270 --> 00:40:34,530
车在前门等了
Ride's waiting out front.

931
00:40:34,530 --> 00:40:35,790
酒店都安排好了
The hotel's all set up.

932
00:40:35,790 --> 00:40:38,250
两张床 含欧陆式早餐 公寓式的
Double beds, continental breakfast, the works.

933
00:40:38,250 --> 00:40:39,950
在一切都处理完之前 我们会派
We'll have two officers posted at your door

934
00:40:39,950 --> 00:40:41,150
两名警官随同保护你们
until things settle down.

935
00:40:41,150 --> 00:40:42,360
你们不用这么做的
You don't have to do this.

936
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:44,160
不是我 是洪都安排的
I didn't. Hondo did.

937
00:40:56,790 --> 00:40:58,400
-你没事吧  -嗯
- You good? - Yeah.

938
00:40:58,770 --> 00:41:00,480
我没事  我只是...
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just, uh...

939
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:02,860
我松了一口气
I'm relieved.

940
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:07,210
你们做得很好
You guys did great out there.

941
00:41:15,050 --> 00:41:16,320
你能帮我个忙吗
Can I ask you a favor?

942
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:24,730
你竟然没找迪肯
Surprised you didn't ask Deac.

943
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:27,300
你找了他没同意 对吧
Oh, he didn't go for it, did he?

944
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:31,980
他说过右转三次不代表左转
Said not to take three rights to make a left.

945
00:41:32,330 --> 00:41:33,510
不管他是什么意思
Whatever that means.

946
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,240
你能签吗
So can you sign it?

947
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:39,620
你确定这对你来说是最好的选择吗
Are you sure this is what's best for you?

948
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:42,110
我确定对她来说是最好的选择
I'm sure it's what's best for her.

949
00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:51,660
谢谢
Thanks.

950
00:41:56,150 --> 00:41:57,180
他们来了
There they are.

951
00:41:57,690 --> 00:41:59,280
伙计们  我想...
Real quick, everyone. Um...

952
00:42:00,510 --> 00:42:01,780
简短说几句话
I want to say something.

953
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:04,180
我曾经有一段时间
There's been times in my life

954
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:06,600
觉得没有人会做我的后盾
when I didn't feel like people really had my back.

955
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:09,650
但是今晚你们每个人为我所做的事...
But what each one of you did for me out there tonight...

956
00:42:12,590 --> 00:42:14,260
我真的不知道该说什么
Look, I-I really don't know what to say

957
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:15,690
只能说我会永远铭记
except I'll never forget it.

958
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:19,630
谢谢你们
Thank you.
