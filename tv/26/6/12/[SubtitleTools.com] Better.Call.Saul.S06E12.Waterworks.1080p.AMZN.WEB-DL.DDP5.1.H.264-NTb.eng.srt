a truck that long, so...

教堂外摆的那种东西

423
00:42:55,106 --> 00:42:58,376
You know, one of those things
outside of the church.

424
00:42:58,509 --> 00:42:59,978
- Nativity scene.
- Yeah.
-耶稣诞生景
-对

425
00:43:00,111 --> 00:43:02,347
Knights of Columbus.
哥伦布骑士团

426
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:05,717
I mean,
what the hell did he even
want that thing for?
他到底要那玩意干吗？

427
00:43:05,851 --> 00:43:07,318
- Huh?
- I mean, I-- I still don't know.
我现在还是搞不懂 白痴

428
00:43:07,452 --> 00:43:08,019
Dumbass.

429
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,222
I told him he could go to Hell
我告诉他偷那种东西可能会下地狱

430
00:43:11,356 --> 00:43:12,557
for stealing something
like that, I mean.
但他有听我的吗？没有

431
00:43:12,691 --> 00:43:14,025
But did he listen to me? No.

432
00:43:16,394 --> 00:43:20,198
But you, you got him off,
like, scot-free. That--
但你 你帮他逃过一劫
让他逍遥法外 那…

433
00:43:21,266 --> 00:43:23,368
That was pretty slick, yo.
真是太厉害了你

434
00:43:23,501 --> 00:43:26,772
Well, tell him I hope
he's keeping his nose clean.
告诉他 我希望他远离毒品

435
00:43:26,905 --> 00:43:28,039
Yeah, yeah, right on.
好 没问题

436
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:30,441
Absolutely.
肯定的

437
00:43:32,177 --> 00:43:33,611
Ah.

438
00:43:33,745 --> 00:43:36,114
Hey, so, you having all this
expertise and all...
嘿 你明明很会打官司

439
00:43:37,716 --> 00:43:39,517
This guy Goodman?
这个叫古德曼的家伙

440
00:43:40,585 --> 00:43:42,320
He the real deal?
他厉害吗？我是说在打官司方面？

441
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:43,621
Like, lawyer-wise?

442
00:43:43,755 --> 00:43:44,823
Why do you ask?
问这个做什么？

443
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:52,330
I got a buddy in there
who's facing some serious time.
我里面有个朋友 他摊上大麻烦了

444
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:54,766
I mean, not-- you know,
not Baby Jesus-time,
不是偷耶稣宝宝那种麻烦
很大的麻烦

445
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:57,402
but... but serious.

446
00:43:56,510 --> 00:44:00,020
他需要找个顶级律师

447
00:43:57,535 --> 00:44:00,038
You know, he needs top-shelf
legal representation.

448
00:44:00,171 --> 00:44:01,807
And I tell him that, right?
我这么跟他说的 好吗？
但他在电视上看到了这人的广告

449
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:04,575
But, you know, he sees this
dude's commercials on TV

450
00:44:04,710 --> 00:44:06,644
and this is where
he wants to go.
所以就想来找他

451
00:44:06,778 --> 00:44:11,116
And I tell him, "Yo, Emilio,
you know, a funny TV commercial
我告诉他：“嘿 埃米利奥 其实

452
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:14,200
浮夸的电视广告
并不一定代表 你懂的…”

453
00:44:11,249 --> 00:44:14,085
is not a sound basis
for, like, you know..."

454
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:18,023
I mean, like, would you
go to doctor to do, like,
你会凭着一条浮夸的电视广告

455
00:44:18,156 --> 00:44:20,425
an operation on you in like a--
就去找那个医生

456
00:44:20,558 --> 00:44:22,160
on, like,
your spleen or whatever

457
00:44:23,729 --> 00:44:25,964
on the fact of a funny
TV commercial?
给你的脾动手术吗？肯定不会

458
00:44:26,097 --> 00:44:27,498
No. I mean, come on.
拜托 这能有什么区别呢？

459
00:44:27,632 --> 00:44:29,400
How is this any different?

460
00:44:29,534 --> 00:44:30,668
You know?

461
00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:36,007
Anyway...
无所谓了

462
00:44:38,409 --> 00:44:40,578
Is this guy any good?
这家伙 他靠得住吗？

463
00:44:49,921 --> 00:44:51,356
When I knew him, he was.
我之前认识他时倒是靠得住

464
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:38,030
（北4街10号）

465
00:47:12,097 --> 00:47:13,264
Hello?
喂？

466
00:47:13,398 --> 00:47:15,400
<i>Hey, uh, Dad?</i>

Are you okay?
你没事吧？

470
00:47:22,007 --> 00:47:24,275
Yeah, no, not really.
好吧 我有事

471
00:47:24,409 --> 00:47:26,377
Um, I, uh...

472
00:47:26,511 --> 00:47:28,213
Dad, I got arrested.
爸爸 我被逮捕了

473
00:47:28,346 --> 00:47:29,480
<i>Oh, no.</i>
不是吧 为什么？小杰

474
00:47:29,614 --> 00:47:31,516
What for? Jeffie.

475
00:47:31,649 --> 00:47:33,451
<i>It's like this crazy mistake,</i>
<i>you know?</i>
就是个离谱的错误 好吗？
我出了事故

476
00:47:33,584 --> 00:47:35,320
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>I had an accident, okay?</i>

477
00:47:35,453 --> 00:47:38,456
<i>A, a little fender-bender</i>
<i>type deal, no, no big thing.</i>
小交通事故 没什么大不了的

478
00:47:38,589 --> 00:47:40,825
<i>My foot maybe slipped</i>
<i>on the accelerator,</i>
我的脚或许不小心踩到了油门
或许油门出了问题

479
00:47:40,959 --> 00:47:43,995
or maybe it was
a defective-- I dunno.

480
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:46,330
我不知道 但这不算大问题

481
00:47:44,129 --> 00:47:46,097
But that's not
the big-deal part.

482
00:47:46,998 --> 00:47:49,400
The big-deal part is,
真正的大问题是 警察认为我…

483
00:47:49,534 --> 00:47:54,405
they think that I, me,
committed a robbery.

484
00:47:51,460 --> 00:47:54,330
他们觉得我犯下了盗窃案

485
00:47:54,539 --> 00:47:56,241
<i>And why would they think that?</i>
-他们怎么会这么想？
-我知道 对吧？

486
00:47:56,374 --> 00:47:58,076
I know, right?

487
00:47:58,209 --> 00:47:59,410
<i>The place</i>
<i>where I had the accident?</i>
我出事的那个地方？
一个喝醉酒的男人？

488
00:47:59,544 --> 00:48:01,246
<i>This guy? This drunk guy?</i>

489
00:48:01,379 --> 00:48:02,880
<i>He comes wandering</i>
<i>out of his house</i>
他从自己家里溜达出来
把警察喊了过去

490
00:48:03,014 --> 00:48:05,816
<i>and flags down the cops,</i>
<i>the, the police, and says,</i>

491
00:48:05,951 --> 00:48:08,019
"Hey, you know, I got robbed!"
他说：“嘿 我家被盗了！”

492
00:48:08,153 --> 00:48:10,121
And sure enough, the police?
警察自然找到了小偷破门而入的证据

493
00:48:10,255 --> 00:48:14,625
They find evidence of, like,
breaking and entering.

494
00:48:14,759 --> 00:48:18,329
And, and, and stuff is missing,
which I did not do.
而且…确实有东西丢了
但不是我偷的

495
00:48:19,664 --> 00:48:23,368
And, uh... yeah. Like that.
还有…

496
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:23,030
对 就是这样

497
00:48:23,501 --> 00:48:26,537
Well, the police are obviously
barking up the wrong tree.
警察显然抓错人了

498
00:48:26,671 --> 00:48:28,206
Yeah. No shit, wrong tree!
对 可不是嘛 抓错人了

499
00:48:28,339 --> 00:48:31,176
- Wrong, like, forest. <i>- Exactly.</i>
-错大发了
-没错

500
00:48:31,309 --> 00:48:33,511
<i>Because you would never do</i>
<i>something like that,</i>
因为你绝对不会做那种事
对吧 儿子？

501
00:48:33,644 --> 00:48:34,645
<i>would you, son?</i>
对 绝对不会 肯定不会

502
00:48:34,779 --> 00:48:37,348
No. No. No way, man.
Absolutely not.

503
00:48:37,482 --> 00:48:39,484
<i>Uh, when the police</i>
<i>took you into custody,</i>
警察羁押你时

504
00:48:39,617 --> 00:48:42,520
<i>did they find any of this</i>
<i>so-called stolen merchandise?</i>
他们有找到所谓的被盗物品吗？

505
00:48:42,653 --> 00:48:44,089
<i>Was it in your possession?</i>
-东西是你在那里吗？
-没有

506
00:48:44,222 --> 00:48:45,890
- No. <i>- Of course it wasn't.</i>
当然没有 因为你没偷任何东西

507
00:48:46,024 --> 00:48:48,226
Because you didn't
steal anything.

508
00:48:48,359 --> 00:48:52,097
Therefore, since there's
no evidence whatsoever
that you committed any crime,
因此 既然没有你盗窃的证据

509
00:48:52,230 --> 00:48:53,531
I'd say you got nothing
to worry about.
我觉得你没什么可担心的

510
00:48:54,865 --> 00:48:56,301
<i>So, what happens next?</i>
那接下来怎么办？

511
00:48:56,434 --> 00:48:58,136
Breathe deep and sit tight.
深呼吸 耐心等待
我会在午饭前把你捞出来

512
00:48:58,269 --> 00:49:00,038

513
00:49:00,171 --> 00:49:02,107
<i>You coming down here yourself?</i>
你要亲自过来吗？

514
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:04,875
Nah, I think it'll be your mom.
不 你妈妈应该会去

515
00:49:06,211 --> 00:49:07,345
You'll talk to her for me?
-你会替我跟她说吗？
-肯定会

516
00:49:07,478 --> 00:49:08,679
<i>I sure will.</i>

517
00:49:08,813 --> 00:49:10,381
<i>I'll straighten it all out,</i>
<i>no problem.</i>
解决一切麻烦 没问题的

518

00:49:38,843 --> 00:49:39,910
Keep your shirt on.
冷静

524
00:49:41,346 --> 00:49:42,313
Hello?

Oh. Oh, God. That boy.

It's a mistake, is all.

531
00:50:03,768 --> 00:50:04,969
Getting picked up
for something you didn't do?
蒙冤被捕？任何人都可能摊上这种事

532
00:50:05,103 --> 00:50:06,637
That could happen to anybody.

533
00:50:06,771 --> 00:50:08,273
<i>Yeah, right, anyone.</i>
好吧 任何人 可这不是第一次了

534
00:50:08,406 --> 00:50:10,341
<i>This isn't</i>

urinating in
someplace he shouldn't have.
在不该撒尿的地方撒尿？

for hours, long distance,
我好几个小时泡在电话上

547
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:42,710
远在千里之外

<i>trying to find him one of those</i>

All right?
You just walk into the station
好吗？你只需走入警局 支付保释金
