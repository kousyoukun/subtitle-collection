1
00:00:20,754 --> 00:00:22,556
-
- Yeah.

2
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:25,259
<i>Do you have</i>
<i>any idea what time it is?</i>

3
00:00:25,393 --> 00:00:27,795
Watched pot never boils, Francesca.

4
00:00:27,928 --> 00:00:29,630
<i>It's been an hour.</i>

5
00:00:29,763 --> 00:00:31,199
<i>You've got a lobby</i>
<i>full of people out here,</i>

6
00:00:31,332 --> 00:00:32,733
<i>and at eight o'clock,</i>
<i>I am done.</i>

7
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:34,034
<i>I don't care if the building</i>
<i>burns down,</i>

8
00:00:34,168 --> 00:00:35,369
<i>I'm going home.</i>

9
00:00:35,503 --> 00:00:37,705
Wow, you and your work ethic.

10
00:00:37,838 --> 00:00:39,840
Did I ever tell you
how indispensable you are?

11
00:00:39,973 --> 00:00:41,109
No?

12
00:00:41,242 --> 00:00:43,211
<i>How much longer, Saul?</i>

13
00:00:43,344 --> 00:00:45,313
You know what? I can't say.

14
00:00:45,446 --> 00:00:47,481
So pass along
my sincerest apologies

15
00:00:47,615 --> 00:00:49,817
and tell 'em I'm swamped.

16
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:51,952
<i>Everyone can hear you</i>
<i>bouncing that thing.</i>

17
00:00:53,621 --> 00:00:55,323
That's the sound of thinking.

18
00:00:55,456 --> 00:00:56,657
You should try it sometime.

19
00:02:21,275 --> 00:02:22,243
<i>Yeah?</i>

20
00:02:22,376 --> 00:02:23,644
What are you waiting for?

21
00:02:23,777 --> 00:02:25,379
Send her in.

22
00:03:21,569 --> 00:03:22,970
How's it coming?

23
00:03:23,103 --> 00:03:24,137
Good.

24
00:03:34,515 --> 00:03:35,883
Did you get the mayonnaise?

25
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,852
Well, here's the thing,

26
00:03:38,986 --> 00:03:41,755
they didn't have Duke's,
and I really like Duke's.

27
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:45,225
But they didn't have it,
which is a bummer. So...

28
00:03:47,295 --> 00:03:48,496
I dunno.

29
00:03:49,297 --> 00:03:50,298
Think this'll work?

30
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:53,801
I mean, technically, it isn't
actually mayonnaise, but...

31
00:03:53,934 --> 00:03:55,202
Yeah,

32
00:03:55,336 --> 00:03:57,170
technically, I don't think
this <i>is</i> mayonnaise.

33
00:03:57,305 --> 00:03:58,171
But close, right?

34
00:04:00,408 --> 00:04:02,242
What do you think?
Should we give it a shot?

35
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:06,680
I dunno. What do you think?

36
00:04:12,019 --> 00:04:13,487
Yeah.

37
00:04:13,621 --> 00:04:14,688
Let's give it a shot.

38
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,828
["Escape

39
00:04:20,961 --> 00:04:22,229
Oh, my gosh.

40
00:04:22,363 --> 00:04:24,498
I don't know.
It's as close as I could get.

41
00:04:24,632 --> 00:04:27,801
Cissy, garnet and gold!
I see it plain as day.

42
00:04:27,935 --> 00:04:30,538
Plus, they're really
beautiful, Cissy.

43
00:04:30,671 --> 00:04:33,206
Ah, the red ones could
maybe pass for garnet.

44
00:04:33,341 --> 00:04:35,275
But the "gold" ones
are just regular yellow.

45
00:04:35,409 --> 00:04:38,312
Well, the minute I saw them
I said, "FSU!"

46
00:04:38,446 --> 00:04:41,081
Besides, gold food coloring?

47
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:42,883
June, did you
ever even hear of that?

48
00:04:43,016 --> 00:04:44,685
No! Sounds expensive.

49
00:04:44,818 --> 00:04:45,719
And if they even
make such a thing,

50
00:04:45,853 --> 00:04:46,920
you'd probably
get flipper-hands

51
00:04:47,054 --> 00:04:48,522
from all the chemicals
they'd put in it.

52
00:04:48,656 --> 00:04:49,790
Well...

53
00:04:49,923 --> 00:04:51,759
This is as close
as I could get, anyway.

54
00:04:51,892 --> 00:04:53,961
- Oh, it's perfect, Cissy.
- Thank you.

55
00:04:54,094 --> 00:04:55,329
- Oh, my gosh.
- Ah, this is all so beautiful.

56
00:04:55,463 --> 00:04:56,864
- Everything looks amazing.
- Looks delicious.

57
00:04:56,997 --> 00:04:57,998
Oh, I forgot spoons. Sorry.

58
00:04:58,131 --> 00:04:59,099
Well, let me tell you
about epoxy--

59
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:00,634
Epoxy yellows.

60
00:05:00,768 --> 00:05:01,602
You hit it
with enough sunlight...

61
00:05:01,735 --> 00:05:02,670
- No. Well--
- He's right.

62
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:04,104
- Wait, no.
- No, he's right.

63
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:06,073
If you just use
a dark enough floor--

64
00:05:06,206 --> 00:05:08,576
Guys, I'm telling you,
we're never gonna settle this.

65
00:05:08,709 --> 00:05:10,744
I've been having this argument
five days a week,

66
00:05:10,878 --> 00:05:12,245
but now I'm Sweden.

67
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:13,747
- Switzerland.
- You want something to drink?

68
00:05:13,881 --> 00:05:15,282
- Wine coolers?
- Great. Cissy?

69
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:17,084
Marvin doesn't
like me to drink.

70
00:05:17,217 --> 00:05:19,753
Cissy, we're gonna
get a wine cooler
down you one day.

71
00:05:27,094 --> 00:05:28,328
That was fun.

72
00:05:28,462 --> 00:05:29,763
Yeah. That <i>was</i> fun.

73
00:05:41,642 --> 00:05:43,343
-
- Yep.

74
00:05:43,477 --> 00:05:44,945
Yep.

75
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:46,780
Yep.

76
00:05:46,914 --> 00:05:47,848
Yep.

77
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:50,484
Yep.

78
00:05:51,652 --> 00:05:53,020
Yep!

79
00:05:53,153 --> 00:05:54,522
Yep.

80
00:05:54,655 --> 00:05:55,923
<i>That's it right there.</i>

81
00:05:56,056 --> 00:05:56,790
<i>Good job, guys.</i>

82
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:00,861
<i>"Peter the Great</i>
<i>is buried inside me."</i>

83
00:06:00,994 --> 00:06:02,295

85
00:06:03,731 --> 00:06:05,666
Boy, you gotta be in shape
to be on this show.

86
00:06:05,799 --> 00:06:07,167
You sure do.

87
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,502
Lotsa running.

88
00:06:08,636 --> 00:06:10,137
Yeah.

89
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:12,239
You think they ever ran
with the bulls on this show?

90
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:13,574
Like, in Spain?

91
00:06:14,842 --> 00:06:17,511
Not that we've seen,
I don't think.

92
00:06:17,645 --> 00:06:18,812
Maybe it's too dangerous.

93
00:06:22,249 --> 00:06:23,016
What do you think?

94
00:06:25,152 --> 00:06:26,053
Maybe.

95
00:06:27,688 --> 00:06:28,822
Maybe.

96
00:06:40,501 --> 00:06:42,503
Oh, I thought the potato salad
worked out great.

97
00:06:42,636 --> 00:06:44,404
- You think?
- Yep.

98
00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:47,107
Huh.

99
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,509
Looks like rain again.

100
00:06:50,444 --> 00:06:51,745
Yeah. Does.

101
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:58,586
Oh, hey, they opened
a new Outback

102
00:06:58,719 --> 00:06:59,620
down in Satellite Beach.

103
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:01,388
- You wanna go Friday?
- Sure.

104
00:07:01,522 --> 00:07:02,556
-
- It's a date.

105
00:07:56,243 --> 00:07:59,279
Yes. Yes.

106
00:07:59,412 --> 00:08:02,816
I don't want to not buy
her toys, but I also...

107
00:08:32,913 --> 00:08:34,447
<i>Could you tell me</i>
<i>the flange diameter</i>

108
00:08:34,582 --> 00:08:36,950
of 212-dash-17-backslash-H?

109
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:39,452
Great.

110
00:08:39,587 --> 00:08:41,288
And does that come in
a three-inch riser,

111
00:08:41,421 --> 00:08:42,189
or just the two-inch?

112
00:08:43,557 --> 00:08:44,692
Great.

113
00:08:44,825 --> 00:08:45,959
ABS or PVC?

114
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,262
Oh. Great.

115
00:09:05,112 --> 00:09:07,080
- Hi.
- Hi.

116
00:09:07,214 --> 00:09:08,415
We're gonna
sing at 5:00.

117
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,250
Oh. Great.

118
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:11,351
Let me see.

119
00:09:19,092 --> 00:09:20,994
That's cute, June.

120
00:09:21,128 --> 00:09:23,096
I'll pick up the cake
after lunch.

121
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:25,565
Do you remember what kind
of ice cream Tammy likes?

122
00:09:25,699 --> 00:09:28,135
Uh... geez, no.

123
00:09:28,268 --> 00:09:30,237
Yeah. So maybe...
What do you think?

124
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:31,605
Vanilla?

125
00:09:31,739 --> 00:09:32,572
Or strawberry?

126
00:09:32,706 --> 00:09:34,174
Ooh.

127
00:09:34,307 --> 00:09:35,075
Um...

128
00:09:39,046 --> 00:09:40,748
They're both good.

129
00:09:40,881 --> 00:09:42,249
I know, right?

130
00:09:44,551 --> 00:09:46,019
- Five o'clock.
- Okay, great.

131
00:09:48,521 --> 00:09:51,024
No,
nobody makes it that long.

132
00:09:51,158 --> 00:09:53,193
Well, I mean, because--
I mean, think about it.

133
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:54,728
It's got to fit
in the truck, right?

134
00:09:54,862 --> 00:09:56,429
So, how's it gonna fit
in the truck if--

135
00:09:58,331 --> 00:10:00,233
Well, yeah, but nobody makes
a truck that long, so...

136
00:10:01,568 --> 00:10:02,636
Safe to say.

137
00:10:05,272 --> 00:10:07,574
Okay. Well, sorry
we couldn't be of service.

138
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:10,443
So...
whatever happened to crack?

139
00:10:10,577 --> 00:10:12,813
How come you never hear
about it on the news anymore?

140
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:15,248
Did everybody just all decide
to stop taking it?

141
00:10:15,382 --> 00:10:17,017
What's the drug that
makes you dance around

142
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:18,318
and put a pacifier
in your mouth?

143
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:20,087
- Ecstasy.
- Ecstasy!

144
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,554
That's the big one now.
I think that they have--

145
00:10:21,689 --> 00:10:22,622
Yeah. That's the big one.

146
00:10:22,756 --> 00:10:24,191
My sister's best friend's son?

147
00:10:24,324 --> 00:10:25,325
Oh, my God...

148
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,060
But I don't understand
the pacifier.

149
00:10:27,194 --> 00:10:28,896
Why would
they all need pacifiers?

150
00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:30,898
Like, don't you think
if you ran a store

151
00:10:31,031 --> 00:10:32,432
and some teenager
came in your store

152
00:10:32,565 --> 00:10:33,600
and tried to buy a pacifier,

153
00:10:33,734 --> 00:10:34,768
don't you think
you'd call the police?

154
00:10:34,902 --> 00:10:36,136
- Yeah.
- Pbht! I sure would.

155
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:38,071
- Absolutely.
- Whatcha eating?

156
00:10:39,006 --> 00:10:40,674
Tuna salad.

157
00:10:40,808 --> 00:10:43,310
I made it with Miracle Whip
instead of mayonnaise.

158
00:10:43,443 --> 00:10:45,645
- Hmm.
- I use almond butter instead of pean--

159
00:11:17,244 --> 00:11:18,111
Mm.

160
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:30,657
When I woke up
this morning,

161
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:32,259
guess what was in
my living room.

162
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:36,463
A freaking exercise bike.

163
00:11:36,596 --> 00:11:39,099
Yeah. I can't believe
he got that for my birthday.

164
00:11:40,567 --> 00:11:41,701
Hold on a second.

165
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:46,206
Palm Coast Sprinkler,
watering your world since 1978.

166
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,109
Please hold.

167
00:11:51,278 --> 00:11:52,712
<i>Yep?</i>

168
00:11:52,846 --> 00:11:54,647
Kim, there's
a Viktor St. Claire
for you on line three.

169
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:57,818
Kim?

170
00:11:57,951 --> 00:11:59,652
<i>Uh, yep. Okay.</i>

171
00:12:01,621 --> 00:12:02,689
Yeah. So, what do you
think about that?

172
00:12:02,823 --> 00:12:03,623
That's pretty rude.

173
00:12:07,027 --> 00:12:08,728
What brand is it?

174
00:12:08,862 --> 00:12:10,563
I don't care who made it.

175
00:12:10,697 --> 00:12:12,132
I don't care
if it's Megatron 3000

176
00:12:12,265 --> 00:12:13,633
or worth $4 million.

177
00:12:14,868 --> 00:12:16,703
I'm gonna ride it
straight back to the store,

178
00:12:16,837 --> 00:12:18,171
and guess what he's gonna get
for his next birthday.

179
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:21,174
Some hair regrowth serum,

180
00:12:21,308 --> 00:12:22,575
and
I'm gonna laugh at him.

181
00:12:23,844 --> 00:12:24,744
Yeah.

182
00:12:47,234 --> 00:12:48,401
Kim Wexler.

183
00:12:48,535 --> 00:12:50,003
<i>Hey, Kim.</i>

184
00:12:50,137 --> 00:12:51,071
<i>You know who this is?</i>

185
00:12:55,909 --> 00:12:57,210
<i>I'm gonna take that as a yes.</i>

186
00:13:00,147 --> 00:13:01,815
<i>Uh, that receptionist of yours,</i>

187
00:13:01,949 --> 00:13:03,250
<i>is she the type to listen in?</i>

188
00:13:05,018 --> 00:13:06,419
- No. <i>- Good.</i>

189
00:13:07,154 --> 00:13:08,721
<i>Okay.</i>

190
00:13:08,856 --> 00:13:11,591
<i>So, how's Florida</i>
<i>been treating you?</i>

191
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:13,260
<i>I'm catching you</i>
<i>between hurricanes, I hope.</i>

192
00:13:15,896 --> 00:13:16,830
<i>Kim, you there?</i>

193
00:13:23,036 --> 00:13:24,071
What do you want?

194
00:13:26,406 --> 00:13:28,241
<i>I don't--</i>
<i>I don't want anything.</i>

195
00:13:29,342 --> 00:13:30,243
<i>I just...</i>

196
00:13:31,912 --> 00:13:33,346
<i>It's been a while, you know?</i>

197
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,249
<i>Just-- I'm thinking</i>
<i>it's been a while,</i>

198
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:39,252
<i>and, um, might be nice</i>
<i>to catch up.</i>

199
00:13:40,888 --> 00:13:42,822
- "Catch up." <i>- Yeah.</i>

200
00:13:42,956 --> 00:13:45,225
My mind was wandering
this morning. I was just...

201
00:13:45,358 --> 00:13:47,827
Not thinking anything
in particular.
Just random thoughts.

202
00:13:47,961 --> 00:13:51,764
And, bam,
it suddenly occurred to me
it's been six years.

203
00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:53,600
<i>I mean, Jesus.</i>

204
00:13:53,733 --> 00:13:54,902
<i>I, I couldn't believe it.</i>

205
00:14:03,743 --> 00:14:06,679
I thought you might wanna know
I'm still alive.

206
00:14:08,748 --> 00:14:10,450
Yep.

207
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:13,853
I'm still out here,
still getting away with it.

208
00:14:13,987 --> 00:14:15,288
The feds couldn't find
their own ass

209
00:14:15,422 --> 00:14:17,090
with both hands
and a proctologist.

210
00:14:17,224 --> 00:14:18,425
You shouldn't be calling me.

211
00:14:18,558 --> 00:14:19,859
<i>Oh, hey! You're awake!</i>

212
00:14:21,161 --> 00:14:23,096
You shouldn't be calling.

213
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:25,465
<i>Why not?</i>
<i>What, am I tying up the line</i>

214
00:14:25,598 --> 00:14:27,034
<i>for important</i>
<i>irrigation business?</i>

215
00:14:27,167 --> 00:14:29,002
<i>- I mean, come on, Kim.</i> <i>Say something.</i>
-

216
00:14:29,136 --> 00:14:30,837
You can call me an asshole,
yell at me.

217
00:14:30,971 --> 00:14:32,872
Just let me know
you've still got a pulse.

218
00:14:35,976 --> 00:14:37,177
<i>Just say something.</i>

219
00:14:39,947 --> 00:14:41,381
You want me to say something?

220
00:14:41,514 --> 00:14:42,916
<i>Yeah.</i>

221
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:44,184
You should turn yourself in.

222
00:14:46,253 --> 00:14:47,320
<i>Do what?</i>

223
00:14:48,922 --> 00:14:49,923
You heard me.

224
00:14:52,825 --> 00:14:54,527
I don't know what kind of life
you've been living,

225
00:14:54,661 --> 00:14:55,528
but it can't be much.

226
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:59,832
<i>Said the pot to the kettle!</i>

227
00:14:59,967 --> 00:15:01,334
<i>What-- That is--</i>

228
00:15:01,468 --> 00:15:05,572
<i>That is really rich, you--</i>
<i>You preaching to me?</i>

229
00:15:05,705 --> 00:15:09,742
<i>See, you have no idea</i>
<i>what I did or didn't do, okay?</i>

230
00:15:09,876 --> 00:15:12,345
<i>A-And why don't you</i>
<i>turn yourself in,</i>

231
00:15:12,479 --> 00:15:13,546
<i>seeing as how you're the one</i>

232
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,115
<i>with the guilty conscience,</i>
<i>huh?</i>

233
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:17,017
<i>What-- What is stopping you?</i>

234
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:18,518
<i>Fring's in the ground.</i>

235
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:20,520
<i>Mike's in the ground.</i>
<i>Lalo's in the ground.</i>

236
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:21,955
<i>Apparently.</i>

237
00:15:22,089 --> 00:15:24,291
<i>You don't have to hold back</i>
<i>on my account.</i>

238
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:26,893
<i>They can only hang me once.</i>
<i>So-- So go ahead.</i>

239
00:15:27,027 --> 00:15:29,696
<i>Spill your guts!</i>
<i>Put on your hair shirt,</i>
<i>see what it gets you!</i>

240
00:15:29,829 --> 00:15:31,531
<i>Why--</i>

241
00:15:31,664 --> 00:15:34,701
<i>Kim, why are we even</i>
<i>talking about this?</i>

242
00:15:34,834 --> 00:15:37,304
<i>We're both too smart to throw</i>
<i>our lives away for no reason.</i>

243
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:38,371
<i>Just...</i>

244
00:15:39,572 --> 00:15:41,674
<i>I just... I only wanted to...</i>

245
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:44,644
<i>Kim.</i>

246
00:15:47,914 --> 00:15:49,382
<i>Kim?</i>

247
00:15:52,185 --> 00:15:53,086
<i>Kim.</i>

248
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:54,921
I'm glad you're alive.

249
00:16:05,198 --> 00:16:06,399
-
- Yeah?

250
00:16:07,667 --> 00:16:08,835
Time to sing!

251
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,403
Okay.

252
00:16:19,112 --> 00:16:22,715
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

253
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:28,255
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

254
00:16:28,388 --> 00:16:34,027
<i>♪ Happy birthday, dear Tammy ♪</i>

255
00:16:34,161 --> 00:16:39,332
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

256
00:18:24,304 --> 00:18:26,439
I can't leave before
the judge dismisses you.

257
00:18:26,573 --> 00:18:27,607
I'll make sure they're aware.

258
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,542
Now, just remember
to sit up straight

259
00:18:29,676 --> 00:18:32,044
and listen carefully when
the judge addresses you.

260
00:18:32,179 --> 00:18:33,980
Stay attentive and engaged.

261
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:37,417
Even if you're not so sure
what's going on, don't show it.

262
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:39,752
All right. Come here.

263
00:18:39,886 --> 00:18:42,121
- Tuck your shirt in for me, will you?
- Okay.

264
00:18:42,255 --> 00:18:43,956
You gotta look good
for the judge.

265
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:45,325
Because of your record...

266
00:19:12,585 --> 00:19:13,753
Kim?

267
00:19:13,886 --> 00:19:15,855
<i>Hi, Cheryl.</i>

268
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:16,956
<i>I'm out front.</i>

269
00:21:38,365 --> 00:21:39,231
Howard was murdered?

270
00:21:45,738 --> 00:21:46,739
Why?

271
00:21:49,409 --> 00:21:50,443
He was...

272
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:54,914
in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

273
00:22:08,795 --> 00:22:09,796
Where's his body?

274
00:22:11,431 --> 00:22:12,632
I don't know.

275
00:22:16,302 --> 00:22:17,637
And the police?

276
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:19,406
Will they search again?

277
00:22:19,539 --> 00:22:20,239
They'll search.

278
00:22:24,811 --> 00:22:26,779
I don't think they'll find him.

279
00:22:31,918 --> 00:22:32,985
Cheryl, he...

280
00:22:35,321 --> 00:22:38,357
It-- it all happened
in an instant.

281
00:22:38,491 --> 00:22:40,693
And he didn't--
he didn't suffer.

282
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:48,668
"He didn't suffer."

283
00:22:52,472 --> 00:22:53,873
The lies you two made up.

284
00:22:54,841 --> 00:22:56,476
The picture you painted.

285
00:22:59,311 --> 00:23:01,113
That's all he is now.

286
00:23:01,247 --> 00:23:04,016
That's all anybody remembers.

287
00:23:07,353 --> 00:23:09,321
I want to change that.

288
00:23:09,456 --> 00:23:11,190
What happens now?

289
00:23:11,323 --> 00:23:13,325
Will you be tried?

290
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:14,527
Will you go to jail?

291
00:23:16,062 --> 00:23:16,829
I don't know.

292
00:23:18,698 --> 00:23:20,399
You're a lawyer, right?

293
00:23:20,533 --> 00:23:23,903
You're a--
A great one, Howard said!

294
00:23:24,036 --> 00:23:25,438
How could you not know?

295
00:23:30,009 --> 00:23:32,812
Bernalillo County
has my affidavit.

296
00:23:32,945 --> 00:23:34,847
It's up to
the district attorney
whether to prosecute.

297
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:38,851
And she may not.

298
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,254
Why?

299
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:46,859
There's no physical evidence.

300
00:23:48,394 --> 00:23:51,698
No remaining witnesses
other than my ex-husband,

301
00:23:51,831 --> 00:23:52,865
assuming he's still alive.

302
00:23:56,335 --> 00:23:57,770
I could sue you in civil court.

303
00:23:57,904 --> 00:23:59,238
I could take
everything you've got.

304
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:05,111
Yeah.

305
00:24:10,817 --> 00:24:11,884
Why are you doing this?

306
00:26:14,206 --> 00:26:15,241
Oh, God!

307
00:29:17,223 --> 00:29:19,859
Passwords. Passwords...

308
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,449
Hmm.

309
00:32:30,582 --> 00:32:31,650
A hat man.

310
00:33:15,861 --> 00:33:17,329
Holy shit.

311
00:34:36,375 --> 00:34:37,509
Nothing to see here.

312
00:34:40,346 --> 00:34:41,347
Move on.

313
00:36:02,728 --> 00:36:04,696
Look at this bullshit.

314
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:06,532
Look.

315
00:36:06,665 --> 00:36:08,934
Look. What would you call this?

316
00:36:09,067 --> 00:36:10,502
I'd call that...

317
00:36:10,636 --> 00:36:12,338
I dunno, what?

318
00:36:12,471 --> 00:36:14,240
Would you call that
a fish taco?

319
00:36:14,373 --> 00:36:16,942
Could anybody
call this a fish taco?
I mean, legally?

320
00:36:17,075 --> 00:36:18,277
Stop waving that thing at me.

321
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:19,778
Look at this!

322
00:36:19,911 --> 00:36:21,780
There's one piece
of goddamned pollock

323
00:36:21,913 --> 00:36:23,114
no bigger than
the end of my thumb.

324
00:36:23,249 --> 00:36:24,383
Now, how can you
even call that a--

325
00:36:24,516 --> 00:36:25,717
Like am I s'posed
to do something?

326
00:36:25,851 --> 00:36:26,785
What do you want me
to do about it?

327
00:36:26,918 --> 00:36:28,119
Well, I want you
to look inside there

328
00:36:28,254 --> 00:36:29,955
and tell me what you see.

329
00:36:30,088 --> 00:36:32,324
Huh? W-Would you
or would you not

330
00:36:32,458 --> 00:36:33,792
sell this to
an unsuspecting public?

331
00:36:33,925 --> 00:36:35,461
Why do you persist
in ordering fish

332
00:36:35,594 --> 00:36:37,195
when we're 1,400 miles away
from the nearest ocean?

333
00:36:37,329 --> 00:36:39,598
Because it's on the menu,
all right?

334
00:36:39,731 --> 00:36:41,967
Because I live in the 21st
goddamn century, all right?

335
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:43,269
Mm.

336
00:36:43,402 --> 00:36:45,136
And this?
This is some bullshit.

337
00:36:45,271 --> 00:36:47,473
I'm telling you,
I got half a mind
to go on back over there

338
00:36:47,606 --> 00:36:49,107
and smack somebody
in their face there.

339
00:38:00,879 --> 00:38:02,714
-

340
00:38:03,582 --> 00:38:04,883
Yes!

341
00:38:59,037 --> 00:39:00,472
What do you think?

342
00:39:00,606 --> 00:39:02,307
Pretty great, right?

343
00:39:02,441 --> 00:39:03,208
Yeah, it's, um...

344
00:39:04,275 --> 00:39:05,944
Yep.

345
00:39:06,077 --> 00:39:08,814
I just need your printed name
and signature.

346
00:39:11,683 --> 00:39:15,286
So, Florida.

347
00:39:15,421 --> 00:39:17,188
Florida, Florida, Florida...

348
00:39:17,322 --> 00:39:18,857
Why there?

349
00:39:21,727 --> 00:39:23,962
- I guess--
- It doesn't matter.

350
00:39:24,095 --> 00:39:26,832
Doesn't have to make sense.

351
00:39:26,965 --> 00:39:29,835
Hey, I gotta tell you,
I think you're gonna regret

352
00:39:29,968 --> 00:39:32,571
not taking your share
of the Sandpiper money.

353
00:39:32,704 --> 00:39:34,372
That'd buy a shitload
of swampland.

354
00:39:45,517 --> 00:39:47,118
I will, um,

355
00:39:48,654 --> 00:39:49,988
file these tomorrow.

356
00:39:50,522 --> 00:39:52,223
All right. Well.

357
00:39:52,357 --> 00:39:53,492
Have a nice life, Kim.

358
00:40:25,891 --> 00:40:28,259
-

359
00:40:30,128 --> 00:40:32,063
Hey, Sweetcheeks,
who do we got next?

360
00:40:32,197 --> 00:40:33,932
Let's make some money!

361
00:40:34,065 --> 00:40:35,901
Emilio Koyama!

362
00:40:41,372 --> 00:40:42,407
Where's your paperwork?

363
00:40:42,541 --> 00:40:44,075
I don't do no paperwork.

364
00:40:45,410 --> 00:40:47,145
He doesn't do paperwork!

365
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:48,780
Who cares? Come on, come on.

366
00:41:44,970 --> 00:41:47,338
Hey, yo, could I bum
one of those?

367
00:41:57,215 --> 00:41:57,949
Thanks.

368
00:42:03,655 --> 00:42:04,956
Mm.

369
00:42:11,196 --> 00:42:12,397
What's up with this shit?

370
00:42:15,433 --> 00:42:17,035
Rainy.

371
00:42:17,168 --> 00:42:20,872
Yeah. No. It-- It's crazy.

372
00:42:21,006 --> 00:42:22,974
It's like bananas,
all this rain.

373
00:42:25,076 --> 00:42:27,278
I mean, I thought we were,
like, in a desert, you know?

374
00:42:37,022 --> 00:42:37,989
You're a lawyer, right?

375
00:42:40,191 --> 00:42:42,560
Ah. I recognize you.

376
00:42:45,897 --> 00:42:47,365
You defended my buddy Combo.

377
00:42:48,667 --> 00:42:50,568
Christian Ortega.

378
00:42:50,702 --> 00:42:52,838
Juvie court,
stole a Baby Jesus.

379
00:42:52,971 --> 00:42:54,973
I mean, not like
a real baby, just a--

380
00:42:55,106 --> 00:42:58,376
You know, one of those things
outside of the church.

381
00:42:58,509 --> 00:42:59,978
- Nativity scene.
- Yeah.

382
00:43:00,111 --> 00:43:02,347
Knights of Columbus.

383
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:05,717
I mean,
what the hell did he even
want that thing for?

384
00:43:05,851 --> 00:43:07,318
- Huh?
- I mean, I-- I still don't know.

385
00:43:07,452 --> 00:43:08,019
Dumbass.

386
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,222
I told him he could go to Hell

387
00:43:11,356 --> 00:43:12,557
for stealing something
like that, I mean.

388
00:43:12,691 --> 00:43:14,025
But did he listen to me? No.

389
00:43:16,394 --> 00:43:20,198
But you, you got him off,
like, scot-free. That--

390
00:43:21,266 --> 00:43:23,368
That was pretty slick, yo.

391
00:43:23,501 --> 00:43:26,772
Well, tell him I hope
he's keeping his nose clean.

392
00:43:26,905 --> 00:43:28,039
Yeah, yeah, right on.

393
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:30,441
Absolutely.

394
00:43:32,177 --> 00:43:33,611
Ah.

395
00:43:33,745 --> 00:43:36,114
Hey, so, you having all this
expertise and all...

396
00:43:37,716 --> 00:43:39,517
This guy Goodman?

397
00:43:40,585 --> 00:43:42,320
He the real deal?

398
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:43,621
Like, lawyer-wise?

399
00:43:43,755 --> 00:43:44,823
Why do you ask?

400
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:52,330
I got a buddy in there
who's facing some serious time.

401
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:54,766
I mean, not-- you know,
not Baby Jesus-time,

402
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:57,402
but... but serious.

403
00:43:57,535 --> 00:44:00,038
You know, he needs top-shelf
legal representation.

404
00:44:00,171 --> 00:44:01,807
And I tell him that, right?

405
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:04,575
But, you know, he sees this
dude's commercials on TV

406
00:44:04,710 --> 00:44:06,644
and this is where
he wants to go.

407
00:44:06,778 --> 00:44:11,116
And I tell him, "Yo, Emilio,
you know, a funny TV commercial

408
00:44:11,249 --> 00:44:14,085
is not a sound basis
for, like, you know..."

409
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:18,023
I mean, like, would you
go to doctor to do, like,

410
00:44:18,156 --> 00:44:20,425
an operation on you in like a--

411
00:44:20,558 --> 00:44:22,160
on, like,
your spleen or whatever

412
00:44:23,729 --> 00:44:25,964
on the fact of a funny
TV commercial?

413
00:44:26,097 --> 00:44:27,498
No. I mean, come on.

414
00:44:27,632 --> 00:44:29,400
How is this any different?

415
00:44:29,534 --> 00:44:30,668
You know?

416
00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:36,007
Anyway...

417
00:44:38,409 --> 00:44:40,578
Is this guy any good?

418
00:44:49,921 --> 00:44:51,356
When I knew him, he was.

419
00:47:12,097 --> 00:47:13,264
Hello?

420
00:47:13,398 --> 00:47:15,400
<i>Hey, uh, Dad?</i>

421
00:47:15,533 --> 00:47:17,768
<i>It's me. It's-- It's Jeff.</i>

422
00:47:17,903 --> 00:47:20,138
Jeff? What time is it?

423
00:47:20,271 --> 00:47:21,873
Are you okay?

424
00:47:22,007 --> 00:47:24,275
Yeah, no, not really.

425
00:47:24,409 --> 00:47:26,377
Um, I, uh...

426
00:47:26,511 --> 00:47:28,213
Dad, I got arrested.

427
00:47:28,346 --> 00:47:29,480
<i>Oh, no.</i>

428
00:47:29,614 --> 00:47:31,516
What for? Jeffie.

429
00:47:31,649 --> 00:47:33,451
<i>It's like this crazy mistake,</i>
<i>you know?</i>

430
00:47:33,584 --> 00:47:35,320
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>I had an accident, okay?</i>

431
00:47:35,453 --> 00:47:38,456
<i>A, a little fender-bender</i>
<i>type deal, no, no big thing.</i>

432
00:47:38,589 --> 00:47:40,825
<i>My foot maybe slipped</i>
<i>on the accelerator,</i>

433
00:47:40,959 --> 00:47:43,995
or maybe it was
a defective-- I dunno.

434
00:47:44,129 --> 00:47:46,097
But that's not
the big-deal part.

435
00:47:46,998 --> 00:47:49,400
The big-deal part is,

436
00:47:49,534 --> 00:47:54,405
they think that I, me,
committed a robbery.

437
00:47:54,539 --> 00:47:56,241
<i>And why would they think that?</i>

438
00:47:56,374 --> 00:47:58,076
I know, right?

439
00:47:58,209 --> 00:47:59,410
<i>The place</i>
<i>where I had the accident?</i>

440
00:47:59,544 --> 00:48:01,246
<i>This guy? This drunk guy?</i>

441
00:48:01,379 --> 00:48:02,880
<i>He comes wandering</i>
<i>out of his house</i>

442
00:48:03,014 --> 00:48:05,816
<i>and flags down the cops,</i>
<i>the, the police, and says,</i>

443
00:48:05,951 --> 00:48:08,019
"Hey, you know, I got robbed!"

444
00:48:08,153 --> 00:48:10,121
And sure enough, the police?

445
00:48:10,255 --> 00:48:14,625
They find evidence of, like,
breaking and entering.

446
00:48:14,759 --> 00:48:18,329
And, and, and stuff is missing,
which I did not do.

447
00:48:19,664 --> 00:48:23,368
And, uh... yeah. Like that.

448
00:48:23,501 --> 00:48:26,537
Well, the police are obviously
barking up the wrong tree.

449
00:48:26,671 --> 00:48:28,206
Yeah. No shit, wrong tree!

450
00:48:28,339 --> 00:48:31,176
- Wrong, like, forest. <i>- Exactly.</i>

451
00:48:31,309 --> 00:48:33,511
<i>Because you would never do</i>
<i>something like that,</i>

452
00:48:33,644 --> 00:48:34,645
<i>would you, son?</i>

453
00:48:34,779 --> 00:48:37,348
No. No. No way, man.
Absolutely not.

454
00:48:37,482 --> 00:48:39,484
<i>Uh, when the police</i>
<i>took you into custody,</i>

455
00:48:39,617 --> 00:48:42,520
<i>did they find any of this</i>
<i>so-called stolen merchandise?</i>

456
00:48:42,653 --> 00:48:44,089
<i>Was it in your possession?</i>

457
00:48:44,222 --> 00:48:45,890
- No. <i>- Of course it wasn't.</i>

458
00:48:46,024 --> 00:48:48,226
Because you didn't
steal anything.

459
00:48:48,359 --> 00:48:52,097
Therefore, since there's
no evidence whatsoever
that you committed any crime,

460
00:48:52,230 --> 00:48:53,531
I'd say you got nothing
to worry about.

461
00:48:54,865 --> 00:48:56,301
<i>So, what happens next?</i>

462
00:48:56,434 --> 00:48:58,136
Breathe deep and sit tight.

463
00:48:58,269 --> 00:49:00,038
I'll have you out by lunchtime.

464
00:49:00,171 --> 00:49:02,107
<i>You coming down here yourself?</i>

465
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:04,875
Nah, I think it'll be your mom.

466
00:49:06,211 --> 00:49:07,345
You'll talk to her for me?

467
00:49:07,478 --> 00:49:08,679
<i>I sure will.</i>

468
00:49:08,813 --> 00:49:10,381
<i>I'll straighten it all out,</i>
<i>no problem.</i>

469
00:49:11,582 --> 00:49:13,384
Yeah, okay. Good.

470
00:49:13,518 --> 00:49:16,921
<i>Jeff, you're gonna get</i>
<i>the best legal defense</i>
<i>in the whole wide world.</i>

471
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:19,024
Trust your old man on that.

472
00:49:19,157 --> 00:49:21,292
<i>Okay, copy that. Sit tight.</i>

473
00:49:21,426 --> 00:49:22,893
You do that.

474
00:49:38,843 --> 00:49:39,910
Keep your shirt on.

475
00:49:41,346 --> 00:49:42,313
Hello?

476
00:49:44,515 --> 00:49:45,783
Gene.

477
00:49:45,916 --> 00:49:47,718
Gene, Honey,
do you know what time it is?

478
00:49:55,626 --> 00:49:58,296
Oh. Oh, God. That boy.

479
00:49:58,429 --> 00:50:00,198
He's gonna put me in my grave.

480
00:50:00,331 --> 00:50:02,033
Marion.

481
00:50:02,167 --> 00:50:03,634
It's a mistake, is all.

482
00:50:03,768 --> 00:50:04,969
Getting picked up
for something you didn't do?

483
00:50:05,103 --> 00:50:06,637
That could happen to anybody.

484
00:50:06,771 --> 00:50:08,273
<i>Yeah, right, anyone.</i>

485
00:50:08,406 --> 00:50:10,341
<i>This isn't</i>
<i>the first time, you know.</i>

486
00:50:10,475 --> 00:50:11,742
He's been in trouble before.

487
00:50:11,876 --> 00:50:12,810
Oh, Jesus.

488
00:50:12,943 --> 00:50:14,145
<i>- Marion...</i>
- The death of me.

489
00:50:14,279 --> 00:50:15,846
He's gonna be the death of me.

490
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:18,983
Marion. Marion,
it's gonna be all right.

491
00:50:19,117 --> 00:50:21,352
We'll get him outta there
lickety-split.

492
00:50:21,486 --> 00:50:23,621
<i>I've been</i>
<i>through this before.</i>

493
00:50:23,754 --> 00:50:26,491
<i>There's nothing</i>
<i>lickety-split about it.</i>

494
00:50:26,624 --> 00:50:29,160
Back when he was living
in Albuquerque?

495
00:50:29,294 --> 00:50:32,163
Drunk in public,
resisting arrest,

496
00:50:32,297 --> 00:50:36,301
urinating in
someplace he shouldn't have.

497
00:50:36,434 --> 00:50:40,004
And me on the telephone
for hours, long distance,

498
00:50:40,138 --> 00:50:42,973
<i>trying to find him one of those</i>
<i>bail-out places.</i>

499
00:50:43,108 --> 00:50:45,210
<i>I maxed out my Discover card.</i>

500
00:50:45,343 --> 00:50:47,312
<i>I'm still paying for that one.</i>

501
00:50:47,445 --> 00:50:48,613
Well, money's
not gonna be a problem,

502
00:50:48,746 --> 00:50:50,781
'cause I'm gonna
help you with that.

503
00:50:50,915 --> 00:50:53,118
No. Gene,
I can't let you do that. No.

504
00:50:53,251 --> 00:50:55,886
<i>Sure you can.</i>
<i>Jeff'll pay me back.</i>

505
00:50:56,020 --> 00:50:58,022
And you don't have to worry
about a bondsman, either.

506
00:50:58,156 --> 00:50:59,324
Because guess what?

507
00:50:59,457 --> 00:51:01,692
In Omaha, they don't have 'em.

508
00:51:01,826 --> 00:51:03,261
All right?
You just walk into the station

509
00:51:03,394 --> 00:51:04,595
and you pay
a straight cash bail.

510
00:51:04,729 --> 00:51:06,497
It's not like
Albuquerque at all.

511
00:51:11,769 --> 00:51:14,004
<i>Marion, you still there?</i>

512
00:51:14,139 --> 00:51:15,840
Yeah. Why--

513
00:51:15,973 --> 00:51:19,510
Why did
Jeff call you instead of me?

514
00:51:19,644 --> 00:51:22,513
Well, I think he was scared
at how you'd take it.

515
00:51:22,647 --> 00:51:24,715
Honestly, I was gonna
pay the bail myself,

516
00:51:24,849 --> 00:51:26,317
but I think it should be
a family member.

517
00:51:26,451 --> 00:51:28,419
I think that'd be best.

518
00:51:28,553 --> 00:51:31,055
<i>I'll tell you what, I'm gonna</i>
<i>take a shower, get dressed.</i>

519
00:51:31,189 --> 00:51:32,257
<i>And you do the same.</i>

520
00:51:32,390 --> 00:51:33,858
<i>I'll swing by and pick you up.</i>

521
00:51:33,991 --> 00:51:35,526
<i>We'll get this whole thing</i>
<i>squared away.</i>

522
00:51:36,761 --> 00:51:39,197
Wh-what about Buddy?
Is he in any trouble?

523
00:51:40,731 --> 00:51:42,300
<i>I don't think so.</i>

524
00:51:42,433 --> 00:51:43,534
<i>Why would he be?</i>

525
00:51:46,404 --> 00:51:48,239
<i>I'll see you in about an hour.</i>

526
00:51:48,373 --> 00:51:49,840
Yeah, okay. Yeah. Thanks.

Everything okay?

Oh, yeah. I'm sorry.

That's okay.

What's that?

569
00:54:35,172 --> 00:54:36,474
You tell me.

570
00:54:40,911 --> 00:54:42,146
Marion, do you think that's me?

571

'Cause it's not.

572

There never was a Nippy,
was there?

573
00:54:52,823 --> 00:54:54,525
What did Jeff tell you?

Oh, he didn't tell me anything.

575

Ask Jeeves told me.

I typed in "con man"
and "Albuquerque,"

What are you doing, Marion?

579
00:55:17,615 --> 00:55:19,149
What do you think I'm doing?
I'm calling the police.

580
00:55:20,418 --> 00:55:22,487
Here, lemme help you with that.

581
00:55:23,888 --> 00:55:24,955
Listen, I think
we're losing sight

of the bigger picture
here, okay?

583
00:55:26,924 --> 00:55:28,926
Jeff is in trouble,
and I wanna help him.

584
00:55:29,059 --> 00:55:30,828
He and I sure could use
your support here.

585
00:55:30,961 --> 00:55:32,397
What did you get my son into?

586
00:55:32,530 --> 00:55:35,299
- Nothing that he didn't ask for.
-

587
00:55:35,433 --> 00:55:37,802
Now, listen,

588
00:55:37,935 --> 00:55:40,805
I'm still the good friend
you thought I was, okay?

589
00:55:40,938 --> 00:55:44,174
Jeff understands me,
Buddy understands me.

590
00:55:44,308 --> 00:55:45,843
And you will, too.

591
00:55:45,976 --> 00:55:48,479
It's just, you have to, uh,

592
00:55:48,613 --> 00:55:51,782
you know, keep things
on an even keel, all right?

593
00:55:53,884 --> 00:55:55,486
- What have you got there?
- Uh...

594
00:55:56,787 --> 00:55:57,955
- Put that down.
- Huh...

595
00:55:59,924 --> 00:56:00,991
Put that down, Marion.

596
00:56:02,827 --> 00:56:03,794

No, Valerie, I'm not okay.

There's a criminal standing
in my kitchen, threatening me!

He's a wanted man,

605
00:56:51,909 --> 00:56:54,411

606

<i>All right, Marion,</i>
<i>I'm calling the police.</i>
