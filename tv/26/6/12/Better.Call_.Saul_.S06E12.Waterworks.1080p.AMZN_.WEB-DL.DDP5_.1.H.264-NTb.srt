1
00:00:20,754 --> 00:00:22,556
Yeah.

2
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:25,259
<i>Do you have
any idea what time it is?</i>

3
00:00:25,393 --> 00:00:27,795
Watched pot never boils, Francesca.

4
00:00:27,928 --> 00:00:29,630
<i>It's been an hour.</i>

5
00:00:29,763 --> 00:00:31,308
<i>You've got a lobby
full of people out here,</i>

6
00:00:31,332 --> 00:00:32,733
<i>and at eight o'clock, I am done.</i>

7
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:34,144
<i>I don't care if the building
burns down,</i>

8
00:00:34,168 --> 00:00:35,369
<i>I'm going home.</i>

9
00:00:35,503 --> 00:00:37,705
Wow, you and your work ethic.

10
00:00:37,838 --> 00:00:39,840
Did I ever tell you
how indispensable you are?

11
00:00:39,973 --> 00:00:41,109
No?

12
00:00:41,242 --> 00:00:43,211
<i>How much longer, Saul?</i>

13
00:00:43,344 --> 00:00:45,313
You know what? I can't say.

14
00:00:45,446 --> 00:00:47,481
So pass along
my sincerest apologies

15
00:00:47,615 --> 00:00:49,817
and tell 'em I'm swamped.

16
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:51,952
<i>Everyone can hear you
bouncing that thing.</i>

17
00:00:53,621 --> 00:00:55,323
That's the sound of thinking.

18
00:00:55,456 --> 00:00:56,657
You should try it sometime.

19
00:02:21,275 --> 00:02:22,275
<i>Yeah?</i>

20
00:02:22,376 --> 00:02:23,644
What are you waiting for?

21
00:02:23,777 --> 00:02:25,379
Send her in.

22
00:03:21,569 --> 00:03:22,970
How's it coming?

23
00:03:23,103 --> 00:03:24,137
Good.

24
00:03:34,515 --> 00:03:35,883
Did you get the mayonnaise?

25
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,852
Well, here's the thing,

26
00:03:38,986 --> 00:03:41,755
they didn't have Duke's,
and I really like Duke's.

27
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:45,225
But they didn't have it,
which is a bummer. So...

28
00:03:47,295 --> 00:03:48,496
I dunno.

29
00:03:49,297 --> 00:03:50,298
Think this'll work?

30
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:53,910
I mean, technically, it isn't
actually mayonnaise, but...

31
00:03:53,934 --> 00:03:55,202
Yeah,

32
00:03:55,336 --> 00:03:57,170
technically, I don't think
this <i>is</i> mayonnaise.

33
00:03:57,305 --> 00:03:58,305
But close, right?

34
00:04:00,408 --> 00:04:02,242
What do you think?
Should we give it a shot?

35
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:06,680
I dunno. What do you think?

36
00:04:12,019 --> 00:04:13,487
Yeah.

37
00:04:13,621 --> 00:04:14,688
Let's give it a shot.

38
00:04:20,961 --> 00:04:22,229
Oh, my gosh.

39
00:04:22,363 --> 00:04:24,498
I don't know.
It's as close as I could get.

40
00:04:24,632 --> 00:04:27,801
Cissy, garnet and gold!
I see it plain as day.

41
00:04:27,935 --> 00:04:30,538
Plus, they're really
beautiful, Cissy.

42
00:04:30,671 --> 00:04:33,206
Ah, the red ones could
maybe pass for garnet.

43
00:04:33,341 --> 00:04:35,275
But the "gold" ones
are just regular yellow.

44
00:04:35,409 --> 00:04:38,312
Well, the minute I saw them
I said, "FSU!"

45
00:04:38,446 --> 00:04:41,081
Besides, gold food coloring?

46
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:42,992
June, did you
ever even hear of that?

47
00:04:43,016 --> 00:04:44,685
No! Sounds expensive.

48
00:04:44,818 --> 00:04:45,829
And if they even
make such a thing,

49
00:04:45,853 --> 00:04:47,030
you'd probably get flipper-hands

50
00:04:47,054 --> 00:04:48,614
from all the chemicals
they'd put in it.

51
00:04:48,656 --> 00:04:49,790
Well...

52
00:04:49,923 --> 00:04:51,759
This is as close
as I could get, anyway.

53
00:04:51,892 --> 00:04:53,961
- Oh, it's perfect, Cissy.
- Thank you.

54
00:04:54,094 --> 00:04:55,439
- Oh, my gosh.
- Ah, this is all so beautiful.

55
00:04:55,463 --> 00:04:56,973
- Everything looks amazing.
- Looks delicious.

56
00:04:56,997 --> 00:04:58,077
Oh, I forgot spoons. Sorry.

57
00:04:58,131 --> 00:04:59,208
Well, let me tell you
about epoxy...

58
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:00,634
Epoxy yellows.

59
00:05:00,768 --> 00:05:01,602
You hit it
with enough sunlight...

60
00:05:01,735 --> 00:05:02,775
- No. Well...
- He's right.

61
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:04,104
- Wait, no.
- No, he's right.

62
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:06,073
If you just use
a dark enough floor...

63
00:05:06,206 --> 00:05:08,576
Guys, I'm telling you,
we're never gonna settle this.

64
00:05:08,709 --> 00:05:10,744
I've been having this argument
five days a week,

65
00:05:10,878 --> 00:05:12,245
but now I'm Sweden.

66
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:13,857
- Switzerland.
- You want something to drink?

67
00:05:13,881 --> 00:05:15,282
- Wine coolers?
- Great. Cissy?

68
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:17,084
Marvin doesn't like me to drink.

69
00:05:17,217 --> 00:05:19,753
Cissy, we're gonna get a
wine cooler down you one day.

70
00:05:27,094 --> 00:05:28,328
That was fun.

71
00:05:28,462 --> 00:05:29,763
Yeah. That <i>was</i> fun.

72
00:05:41,642 --> 00:05:43,343
Yep.

73
00:05:43,477 --> 00:05:44,945
Yep.

74
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:46,780
Yep.

75
00:05:46,914 --> 00:05:47,914
Yep.

76
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:50,484
Yep.

77
00:05:51,652 --> 00:05:53,020
Yep!

78
00:05:53,153 --> 00:05:54,522
Yep.

79
00:05:54,655 --> 00:05:55,923
<i>That's it right there.</i>

80
00:05:56,056 --> 00:05:57,056
<i>Good job, guys.</i>

81
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:00,861
<i>"Peter the Great
is buried inside me."</i>

82
00:06:00,994 --> 00:06:02,406
<i>- "Find me in..."</i>
- What did she say?

83
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:03,707
<i>We're gonna help each other.</i>

84
00:06:03,731 --> 00:06:05,666
Boy, you gotta be in
shape to be on this show.

85
00:06:05,799 --> 00:06:07,167
You sure do.

86
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,502
Lotsa running.

87
00:06:08,636 --> 00:06:10,137
Yeah.

88
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:12,310
You think they ever ran
with the bulls on this show?

89
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:13,574
Like, in Spain?

90
00:06:14,842 --> 00:06:17,511
Not that we've
seen, I don't think.

91
00:06:17,645 --> 00:06:18,812
Maybe it's too dangerous.

92
00:06:22,249 --> 00:06:23,249
What do you think?

93
00:06:25,152 --> 00:06:26,152
Maybe.

94
00:06:27,688 --> 00:06:28,822
Maybe.

95
00:06:40,501 --> 00:06:42,503
Oh, I thought the potato
salad worked out great.

96
00:06:42,636 --> 00:06:44,404
- You think?
- Yep.

97
00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:47,107
Huh.

98
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,509
Looks like rain again.

99
00:06:50,444 --> 00:06:51,745
Yeah. Does.

100
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:58,586
Oh, hey, they
opened a new Outback

101
00:06:58,719 --> 00:06:59,719
down in Satellite Beach.

102
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:01,388
- You wanna go Friday?
- Sure.

103
00:07:01,522 --> 00:07:02,802
It's a date.

104
00:07:56,243 --> 00:07:59,279
Yes. Yes.

105
00:07:59,412 --> 00:08:02,816
I don't want to not buy
her toys, but I also...

106
00:08:32,913 --> 00:08:34,558
<i>Could you tell
me the flange diameter</i>

107
00:08:34,582 --> 00:08:36,950
of 212-dash-17-backslash-H?

108
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:39,452
Great.

109
00:08:39,587 --> 00:08:41,288
And does that come
in a three-inch riser,

110
00:08:41,421 --> 00:08:42,421
or just the two-inch?

111
00:08:43,557 --> 00:08:44,692
Great.

112
00:08:44,825 --> 00:08:45,959
ABS or PVC?

113
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,262
Oh. Great.

114
00:09:05,112 --> 00:09:07,080
- Hi.
- Hi.

115
00:09:07,214 --> 00:09:08,524
We're
gonna sing at 5:00.

116
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,250
Oh. Great.

117
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:11,383
Let me see.

118
00:09:19,092 --> 00:09:20,994
That's cute, June.

119
00:09:21,128 --> 00:09:23,096
I'll pick up the
cake after lunch.

120
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:25,565
Do you remember what kind
of ice cream Tammy likes?

121
00:09:25,699 --> 00:09:28,135
Uh... geez, no.

122
00:09:28,268 --> 00:09:30,237
Yeah. So maybe...
What do you think?

123
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:31,605
Vanilla?

124
00:09:31,739 --> 00:09:32,572
Or strawberry?

125
00:09:32,706 --> 00:09:34,174
Ooh.

126
00:09:34,307 --> 00:09:35,307
Um...

127
00:09:39,046 --> 00:09:40,748
They're both good.

128
00:09:40,881 --> 00:09:42,249
I know, right?

129
00:09:44,551 --> 00:09:46,019
- Five o'clock.
- Okay, great.

130
00:09:48,521 --> 00:09:51,024
No, nobody makes it that long.

131
00:09:51,158 --> 00:09:53,193
Well, I mean, because...
I mean, think about it.

132
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:54,728
It's got to fit in
the truck, right?

133
00:09:54,862 --> 00:09:56,462
So, how's it gonna
fit in the truck if...

134
00:09:58,331 --> 00:10:00,411
Well, yeah, but nobody
makes a truck that long, so...

135
00:10:01,568 --> 00:10:02,636
Safe to say.

136
00:10:05,272 --> 00:10:07,574
Okay. Well, sorry we
couldn't be of service.

137
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:10,443
So... whatever
happened to crack?

138
00:10:10,577 --> 00:10:12,813
How come you never hear
about it on the news anymore?

139
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:15,248
Did everybody just all
decide to stop taking it?

140
00:10:15,382 --> 00:10:17,062
What's the drug that
makes you dance around

141
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:18,427
and put a pacifier
in your mouth?

142
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:20,087
- Ecstasy.
- Ecstasy!

143
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,665
That's the big one now.
I think that they have...

144
00:10:21,689 --> 00:10:22,689
Yeah. That's the big one.

145
00:10:22,756 --> 00:10:24,191
My sister's best friend's son?

146
00:10:24,324 --> 00:10:25,325
Oh, my God...

147
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,060
But I don't
understand the pacifier.

148
00:10:27,194 --> 00:10:28,896
Why would they
all need pacifiers?

149
00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:30,898
Like, don't you think
if you ran a store

150
00:10:31,031 --> 00:10:32,432
and some teenager
came in your store

151
00:10:32,565 --> 00:10:33,685
and tried to buy a pacifier,

152
00:10:33,734 --> 00:10:34,878
don't you think
you'd call the police?

153
00:10:34,902 --> 00:10:36,136
- Yeah.
- Pbht! I sure would.

154
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:38,071
- Absolutely.
- Whatcha eating?

155
00:10:39,006 --> 00:10:40,674
Tuna salad.

156
00:10:40,808 --> 00:10:43,310
I made it with Miracle
Whip instead of mayonnaise.

157
00:10:43,443 --> 00:10:46,083
- Hmm.
- I use almond butter instead of pean...

158
00:11:17,244 --> 00:11:18,244
Mm.

159
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:30,657
When I woke up this morning,

160
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:32,259
guess what was
in my living room.

161
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:36,463
A freaking exercise bike.

162
00:11:36,596 --> 00:11:39,099
Yeah. I can't believe he
got that for my birthday.

163
00:11:40,567 --> 00:11:41,701
Hold on a second.

164
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:46,206
Palm Coast Sprinkler,
watering your world since 1978.

165
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,109
Please hold.

166
00:11:51,278 --> 00:11:52,712
<i>Yep?</i>

167
00:11:52,846 --> 00:11:55,006
Kim, there's a Viktor St.
Claire for you on line three.

168
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:57,850
Kim?

169
00:11:57,951 --> 00:11:59,652
<i>Uh, yep. Okay.</i>

170
00:12:01,621 --> 00:12:02,799
Yeah. So, what do
you think about that?

171
00:12:02,823 --> 00:12:03,823
That's pretty rude.

172
00:12:07,027 --> 00:12:08,728
What brand is it?

173
00:12:08,862 --> 00:12:10,563
I don't care who made it.

174
00:12:10,697 --> 00:12:12,132
I don't care if it's
Megatron 3000

175
00:12:12,265 --> 00:12:13,633
or worth $4 million.

176
00:12:14,868 --> 00:12:16,703
I'm gonna ride it
straight back to the store,

177
00:12:16,837 --> 00:12:18,877
and guess what he's gonna
get for his next birthday.

178
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:21,174
Some hair regrowth serum,

179
00:12:21,308 --> 00:12:22,788
and I'm gonna laugh at him.

180
00:12:23,844 --> 00:12:24,844
Yeah.

181
00:12:47,234 --> 00:12:48,401
Kim Wexler.

182
00:12:48,535 --> 00:12:50,003
<i>Hey, Kim.</i>

183
00:12:50,137 --> 00:12:51,137
<i>You know who this is?</i>

184
00:12:55,909 --> 00:12:57,210
<i>I'm gonna take that as a yes.</i>

185
00:13:00,147 --> 00:13:01,815
<i>Uh, that receptionist of yours,</i>

186
00:13:01,949 --> 00:13:03,250
<i>is she the type to listen in?</i>

187
00:13:05,018 --> 00:13:06,419
- No. <i>- Good.</i>

188
00:13:07,154 --> 00:13:08,721
<i>Okay.</i>

189
00:13:08,856 --> 00:13:11,591
<i>So, how's Florida
been treating you?</i>

190
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:13,444
<i>I'm catching you between
hurricanes, I hope.</i>

191
00:13:15,896 --> 00:13:16,896
<i>Kim, you there?</i>

192
00:13:23,036 --> 00:13:24,071
What do you want?

193
00:13:26,406 --> 00:13:28,241
<i>I don't... I don't want anything.</i>

194
00:13:29,342 --> 00:13:30,342
<i>I just...</i>

195
00:13:31,912 --> 00:13:33,346
<i>It's been a while, you know?</i>

196
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,249
<i>Just... I'm thinking
it's been a while,</i>

197
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:39,252
<i>and, um, might
be nice to catch up.</i>

198
00:13:40,888 --> 00:13:42,822
- "Catch up." <i>- Yeah.</i>

199
00:13:42,956 --> 00:13:45,225
My mind was wandering
this morning. I was just...

200
00:13:45,358 --> 00:13:47,827
Not thinking anything in
particular. Just random thoughts.

201
00:13:47,961 --> 00:13:51,764
And, bam, it suddenly occurred
to me it's been six years.

202
00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:53,600
<i>I mean, Jesus.</i>

203
00:13:53,733 --> 00:13:54,902
<i>I, I couldn't believe it.</i>

204
00:14:03,743 --> 00:14:06,679
I thought you might
wanna know I'm still alive.

205
00:14:08,748 --> 00:14:10,450
Yep.

206
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:13,853
I'm still out here, still
getting away with it.

207
00:14:13,987 --> 00:14:15,387
The feds couldn't
find their own ass

208
00:14:15,422 --> 00:14:17,090
with both hands
and a proctologist.

209
00:14:17,224 --> 00:14:18,425
You shouldn't be calling me.

210
00:14:18,558 --> 00:14:19,859
<i>Oh, hey! You're awake!</i>

211
00:14:21,161 --> 00:14:23,096
You shouldn't be calling.

212
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:25,465
<i>Why not? What,
am I tying up the line</i>

213
00:14:25,598 --> 00:14:27,034
<i>for important
irrigation business?</i>

214
00:14:27,167 --> 00:14:29,087
<i>I mean, come on, Kim. Say something.</i>

215
00:14:29,136 --> 00:14:30,837
You can call me an
asshole, yell at me.

216
00:14:30,971 --> 00:14:32,872
Just let me know
you've still got a pulse.

217
00:14:35,976 --> 00:14:37,177
<i>Just say something.</i>

218
00:14:39,947 --> 00:14:41,381
You want me to say something?

219
00:14:41,514 --> 00:14:42,916
<i>Yeah.</i>

220
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:44,184
You should turn yourself in.

221
00:14:46,253 --> 00:14:47,320
<i>Do what?</i>

222
00:14:48,922 --> 00:14:49,923
You heard me.

223
00:14:52,825 --> 00:14:54,637
I don't know what kind
of life you've been living,

224
00:14:54,661 --> 00:14:55,661
but it can't be much.

225
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:59,832
<i>Said the pot to the kettle!</i>

226
00:14:59,967 --> 00:15:01,334
<i>What... That is...</i>

227
00:15:01,468 --> 00:15:05,572
<i>That is really rich, you...
You preaching to me?</i>

228
00:15:05,705 --> 00:15:09,742
<i>See, you have no idea
what I did or didn't do, okay?</i>

229
00:15:09,876 --> 00:15:12,345
<i>A-And why don't
you turn yourself in,</i>

230
00:15:12,479 --> 00:15:13,599
<i>seeing as how you're the one</i>

231
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,115
<i>with the guilty conscience, huh?</i>

232
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:17,017
<i>What... What is stopping you?</i>

233
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:18,518
<i>Fring's in the ground.</i>

234
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:20,520
<i>Mike's in the ground.
Lalo's in the ground.</i>

235
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:21,955
<i>Apparently.</i>

236
00:15:22,089 --> 00:15:24,291
<i>You don't have to hold
back on my account.</i>

237
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:26,893
<i>They can only hang me
once. So... So go ahead.</i>

238
00:15:27,027 --> 00:15:29,696
<i>Spill your guts! Put on your
hair shirt, see what it gets you!</i>

239
00:15:29,829 --> 00:15:31,531
<i>Why...</i>

240
00:15:31,664 --> 00:15:34,701
<i>Kim, why are we
even talking about this?</i>

241
00:15:34,834 --> 00:15:37,304
<i>We're both too smart to throw
our lives away for no reason.</i>

242
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:38,437
<i>Just...</i>

243
00:15:39,572 --> 00:15:41,674
<i>I just... I only wanted to...</i>

244
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:44,710
<i>Kim.</i>

245
00:15:47,914 --> 00:15:49,382
<i>Kim?</i>

246
00:15:52,185 --> 00:15:53,185
<i>Kim.</i>

247
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:54,921
I'm glad you're alive.

248
00:16:05,198 --> 00:16:06,399
Yeah?

249
00:16:07,667 --> 00:16:08,835
Time to sing!

250
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,403
Okay.

251
00:18:24,304 --> 00:18:26,439
I can't leave before
the judge dismisses you.

252
00:18:26,573 --> 00:18:27,716
I'll make sure they're aware.

253
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,542
Now, just remember
to sit up straight

254
00:18:29,676 --> 00:18:32,044
and listen carefully when
the judge addresses you.

255
00:18:32,179 --> 00:18:33,980
Stay attentive and engaged.

256
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:37,417
Even if you're not so sure
what's going on, don't show it.

257
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:39,752
All right. Come here.

258
00:18:39,886 --> 00:18:42,121
- Tuck your shirt in for me, will you?
- Okay.

259
00:18:42,255 --> 00:18:43,956
You gotta look
good for the judge.

260
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:45,325
Because of your record...

261
00:19:12,585 --> 00:19:13,753
Kim?

262
00:19:13,886 --> 00:19:15,855
<i>Hi, Cheryl.</i>

263
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:16,988
<i>I'm out front.</i>

264
00:21:38,365 --> 00:21:39,365
Howard was murdered?

265
00:21:45,738 --> 00:21:46,739
Why?

266
00:21:49,409 --> 00:21:50,443
He was...

267
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:55,220
in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

268
00:22:08,795 --> 00:22:09,796
Where's his body?

269
00:22:11,431 --> 00:22:12,632
I don't know.

270
00:22:16,302 --> 00:22:17,637
And the police?

271
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:19,406
Will they search again?

272
00:22:19,539 --> 00:22:20,539
They'll search.

273
00:22:24,811 --> 00:22:26,779
I don't think they'll find him.

274
00:22:31,918 --> 00:22:32,985
Cheryl, he...

275
00:22:35,321 --> 00:22:38,357
It... it all happened
in an instant.

276
00:22:38,491 --> 00:22:40,693
And he didn't...
He didn't suffer.

277
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:48,668
"He didn't suffer."

278
00:22:52,472 --> 00:22:53,873
The lies you two made up.

279
00:22:54,841 --> 00:22:56,476
The picture you painted.

280
00:22:59,311 --> 00:23:01,113
That's all he is now.

281
00:23:01,247 --> 00:23:04,016
That's all anybody remembers.

282
00:23:07,353 --> 00:23:09,321
I want to change that.

283
00:23:09,456 --> 00:23:11,190
What happens now?

284
00:23:11,323 --> 00:23:13,325
Will you be tried?

285
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:14,527
Will you go to jail?

286
00:23:16,062 --> 00:23:17,062
I don't know.

287
00:23:18,698 --> 00:23:20,399
You're a lawyer, right?

288
00:23:20,533 --> 00:23:23,903
You're a... A
great one, Howard said!

289
00:23:24,036 --> 00:23:25,438
How could you not know?

290
00:23:30,009 --> 00:23:32,812
Bernalillo County
has my affidavit.

291
00:23:32,945 --> 00:23:35,065
It's up to the district
attorney whether to prosecute.

292
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:38,950
And she may not.

293
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,320
Why?

294
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:46,859
There's no physical evidence.

295
00:23:48,394 --> 00:23:51,698
No remaining witnesses
other than my ex-husband,

296
00:23:51,831 --> 00:23:52,871
assuming he's still alive.

297
00:23:56,335 --> 00:23:57,770
I could sue you in civil court.

298
00:23:57,904 --> 00:23:59,264
I could take
everything you've got.

299
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:05,210
Yeah.

300
00:24:10,817 --> 00:24:11,884
Why are you doing this?

301
00:26:14,206 --> 00:26:15,241
Oh, God!

302
00:29:17,223 --> 00:29:19,859
Passwords. Passwords...

303
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,449
Hmm.

304
00:32:30,582 --> 00:32:31,650
A hat man.

305
00:33:15,861 --> 00:33:17,329
Holy shit.

306
00:34:36,375 --> 00:34:37,509
Nothing to see here.

307
00:34:40,346 --> 00:34:41,347
Move on.

308
00:36:02,728 --> 00:36:04,696
Look at this bullshit.

309
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:06,532
Look.

310
00:36:06,665 --> 00:36:08,934
Look. What would you call this?

311
00:36:09,067 --> 00:36:10,502
I'd call that...

312
00:36:10,636 --> 00:36:12,338
I dunno, what?

313
00:36:12,471 --> 00:36:14,240
Would you call that a fish taco?

314
00:36:14,373 --> 00:36:16,942
Could anybody call this a
fish taco? I mean, legally?

315
00:36:17,075 --> 00:36:18,277
Stop waving that thing at me.

316
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:19,778
Look at this!

317
00:36:19,911 --> 00:36:21,780
There's one piece
of goddamned pollock

318
00:36:21,913 --> 00:36:23,225
no bigger than the
end of my thumb.

319
00:36:23,249 --> 00:36:24,492
Now, how can you
even call that a...

320
00:36:24,516 --> 00:36:25,827
Like am I s'posed
to do something?

321
00:36:25,851 --> 00:36:26,894
What do you want
me to do about it?

322
00:36:26,918 --> 00:36:28,230
Well, I want you
to look inside there

323
00:36:28,254 --> 00:36:29,955
and tell me what you see.

324
00:36:30,088 --> 00:36:32,324
Huh? W-Would
you or would you not

325
00:36:32,458 --> 00:36:33,858
sell this to an
unsuspecting public?

326
00:36:33,925 --> 00:36:35,461
Why do you persist
in ordering fish

327
00:36:35,594 --> 00:36:37,305
when we're 1,400 miles
away from the nearest ocean?

328
00:36:37,329 --> 00:36:39,598
Because it's on
the menu, all right?

329
00:36:39,731 --> 00:36:41,967
Because I live in the 21st
goddamn century, all right?

330
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:43,269
Mm.

331
00:36:43,402 --> 00:36:45,136
And this? This is some bullshit.

332
00:36:45,271 --> 00:36:47,582
I'm telling you, I got half a
mind to go on back over there

333
00:36:47,606 --> 00:36:49,126
and smack somebody
in their face there.

334
00:38:03,582 --> 00:38:04,883
Yes!

335
00:38:59,037 --> 00:39:00,472
What do you think?

336
00:39:00,606 --> 00:39:02,307
Pretty great, right?

337
00:39:02,441 --> 00:39:03,441
Yeah, it's, um...

338
00:39:04,275 --> 00:39:05,944
Yep.

339
00:39:06,077 --> 00:39:08,814
I just need your printed
name and signature.

340
00:39:11,683 --> 00:39:15,286
So, Florida.

341
00:39:15,421 --> 00:39:17,188
Florida, Florida, Florida...

342
00:39:17,322 --> 00:39:18,857
Why there?

343
00:39:21,727 --> 00:39:23,962
- I guess...
- It doesn't matter.

344
00:39:24,095 --> 00:39:26,832
Doesn't have to make sense.

345
00:39:26,965 --> 00:39:29,835
Hey, I gotta tell you, I
think you're gonna regret

346
00:39:29,968 --> 00:39:32,571
not taking your share
of the Sandpiper money.

347
00:39:32,704 --> 00:39:34,372
That'd buy a shitload
of swampland.

348
00:39:45,517 --> 00:39:47,118
I will, um,

349
00:39:48,654 --> 00:39:49,988
file these tomorrow.

350
00:39:50,522 --> 00:39:52,223
All right. Well.

351
00:39:52,357 --> 00:39:53,492
Have a nice life, Kim.

352
00:40:30,128 --> 00:40:32,063
Hey, Sweetcheeks,
who do we got next?

353
00:40:32,197 --> 00:40:33,932
Let's make some money!

354
00:40:34,065 --> 00:40:35,901
Emilio Koyama!

355
00:40:41,372 --> 00:40:42,407
Where's your paperwork?

356
00:40:42,541 --> 00:40:44,075
I don't do no paperwork.

357
00:40:45,410 --> 00:40:47,145
He doesn't do paperwork!

358
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:48,780
Who cares? Come on, come on.

359
00:41:44,970 --> 00:41:47,338
Hey, yo, could I
bum one of those?

360
00:41:57,215 --> 00:41:58,215
Thanks.

361
00:42:03,655 --> 00:42:04,956
Mm.

362
00:42:11,196 --> 00:42:12,397
What's up with this shit?

363
00:42:15,433 --> 00:42:17,035
Rainy.

364
00:42:17,168 --> 00:42:20,872
Yeah. No. It... It's crazy.

365
00:42:21,006 --> 00:42:22,974
It's like bananas,
all this rain.

366
00:42:25,076 --> 00:42:27,278
I mean, I thought we were,
like, in a desert, you know?

367
00:42:37,022 --> 00:42:38,022
You're a lawyer, right?

368
00:42:40,191 --> 00:42:42,560
Ah. I recognize you.

369
00:42:45,897 --> 00:42:47,365
You defended my buddy Combo.

370
00:42:48,667 --> 00:42:50,568
Christian Ortega.

371
00:42:50,702 --> 00:42:52,838
Juvie court, stole a Baby Jesus.

372
00:42:52,971 --> 00:42:54,973
I mean, not like a
real baby, just a...

373
00:42:55,106 --> 00:42:58,376
You know, one of those
things outside of the church.

374
00:42:58,509 --> 00:42:59,978
- Nativity scene.
- Yeah.

375
00:43:00,111 --> 00:43:02,347
Knights of Columbus.

376
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:05,717
I mean, what the hell did
he even want that thing for?

377
00:43:05,851 --> 00:43:07,428
- Huh?
- I mean, I... I still don't know.

378
00:43:07,452 --> 00:43:08,452
Dumbass.

379
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,222
I told him he could go to Hell

380
00:43:11,356 --> 00:43:12,667
for stealing something
like that, I mean.

381
00:43:12,691 --> 00:43:14,025
But did he listen to me? No.

382
00:43:16,394 --> 00:43:20,198
But you, you got him
off, like, scot-free. That...

383
00:43:21,266 --> 00:43:23,368
That was pretty slick, yo.

384
00:43:23,501 --> 00:43:26,772
Well, tell him I hope he's
keeping his nose clean.

385
00:43:26,905 --> 00:43:28,039
Yeah, yeah, right on.

386
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:30,540
Absolutely.

387
00:43:32,177 --> 00:43:33,611
Ah.

388
00:43:33,745 --> 00:43:36,114
Hey, so, you having all
this expertise and all...

389
00:43:37,716 --> 00:43:39,517
This guy Goodman?

390
00:43:40,585 --> 00:43:42,320
He the real deal?

391
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:43,621
Like, lawyer-wise?

392
00:43:43,755 --> 00:43:44,823
Why do you ask?

393
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:52,330
I got a buddy in there who's
facing some serious time.

394
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:54,766
I mean, not... you know,
not Baby Jesus-time,

395
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:57,402
but... but serious.

396
00:43:57,535 --> 00:44:00,038
You know, he needs
top-shelf legal representation.

397
00:44:00,171 --> 00:44:01,807
And I tell him that, right?

398
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:04,575
But, you know, he sees this
dude's commercials on TV

399
00:44:04,710 --> 00:44:06,644
and this is where
he wants to go.

400
00:44:06,778 --> 00:44:11,116
And I tell him, "Yo, Emilio, you
know, a funny TV commercial

401
00:44:11,249 --> 00:44:14,085
is not a sound basis
for, like, you know..."

402
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:18,023
I mean, like, would you
go to doctor to do, like,

403
00:44:18,156 --> 00:44:20,425
an operation on you in like a...

404
00:44:20,558 --> 00:44:22,160
On, like, your
spleen or whatever

405
00:44:23,729 --> 00:44:25,964
on the fact of a
funny TV commercial?

406
00:44:26,097 --> 00:44:27,498
No. I mean, come on.

407
00:44:27,632 --> 00:44:29,400
How is this any different?

408
00:44:29,534 --> 00:44:30,668
You know?

409
00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:36,140
Anyway...

410
00:44:38,409 --> 00:44:40,578
Is this guy any good?

411
00:44:49,921 --> 00:44:51,356
When I knew him, he was.

412
00:47:12,097 --> 00:47:13,264
Hello?

413
00:47:13,398 --> 00:47:15,400
<i>Hey, uh, Dad?</i>

414
00:47:15,533 --> 00:47:17,768
<i>It's me. It's... It's Jeff.</i>

415
00:47:17,903 --> 00:47:20,138
Jeff? What time is it?

416
00:47:20,271 --> 00:47:21,873
Are you okay?

417
00:47:22,007 --> 00:47:24,275
Yeah, no, not really.

418
00:47:24,409 --> 00:47:26,377
Um, I, uh...

419
00:47:26,511 --> 00:47:28,213
Dad, I got arrested.

420
00:47:28,346 --> 00:47:29,480
<i>Oh, no.</i>

421
00:47:29,614 --> 00:47:31,516
What for? Jeffie.

422
00:47:31,649 --> 00:47:33,451
<i>It's like this crazy
mistake, you know?</i>

423
00:47:33,584 --> 00:47:35,320
<i>I mean, I had an accident, okay?</i>

424
00:47:35,453 --> 00:47:38,456
<i>A, a little fender-bender
type deal, no, no big thing.</i>

425
00:47:38,589 --> 00:47:40,825
<i>My foot maybe slipped
on the accelerator,</i>

426
00:47:40,959 --> 00:47:43,995
or maybe it was a
defective... I dunno.

427
00:47:44,129 --> 00:47:46,097
But that's not
the big-deal part.

428
00:47:46,998 --> 00:47:49,400
The big-deal part is,

429
00:47:49,534 --> 00:47:54,405
they think that I, me,
committed a robbery.

430
00:47:54,539 --> 00:47:56,241
<i>And why would they think that?</i>

431
00:47:56,374 --> 00:47:58,076
I know, right?

432
00:47:58,209 --> 00:47:59,520
<i>The place where I
had the accident?</i>

433
00:47:59,544 --> 00:48:01,246
<i>This guy? This drunk guy?</i>

434
00:48:01,379 --> 00:48:02,880
<i>He comes wandering
out of his house</i>

435
00:48:03,014 --> 00:48:05,816
<i>and flags down the cops,
the, the police, and says,</i>

436
00:48:05,951 --> 00:48:08,019
"Hey, you know, I got robbed!"

437
00:48:08,153 --> 00:48:10,121
And sure enough, the police?

438
00:48:10,255 --> 00:48:14,625
They find evidence of,
like, breaking and entering.

439
00:48:14,759 --> 00:48:18,329
And, and, and stuff is
missing, which I did not do.

440
00:48:19,664 --> 00:48:23,368
And, uh... yeah. Like that.

441
00:48:23,501 --> 00:48:26,537
Well, the police are obviously
barking up the wrong tree.

442
00:48:26,671 --> 00:48:28,206
Yeah. No shit, wrong tree!

443
00:48:28,339 --> 00:48:31,176
- Wrong, like, forest.
<i>- Exactly.</i>

444
00:48:31,309 --> 00:48:33,511
<i>Because you would never
do something like that,</i>

445
00:48:33,644 --> 00:48:34,645
<i>would you, son?</i>

446
00:48:34,779 --> 00:48:37,348
No. No. No way,
man. Absolutely not.

447
00:48:37,482 --> 00:48:39,484
<i>Uh, when the police
took you into custody,</i>

448
00:48:39,617 --> 00:48:42,520
<i>did they find any of this
so-called stolen merchandise?</i>

449
00:48:42,653 --> 00:48:44,089
<i>Was it in your possession?</i>

450
00:48:44,222 --> 00:48:45,890
- No. <i>- Of course it wasn't.</i>

451
00:48:46,024 --> 00:48:48,226
Because you
didn't steal anything.

452
00:48:48,359 --> 00:48:52,097
Therefore, since there's no evidence
whatsoever that you committed any crime,

453
00:48:52,230 --> 00:48:53,750
I'd say you got
nothing to worry about.

454
00:48:54,865 --> 00:48:56,301
<i>So, what happens next?</i>

455
00:48:56,434 --> 00:48:58,136
Breathe deep and sit tight.

456
00:48:58,269 --> 00:49:00,038
I'll have you out by lunchtime.

457
00:49:00,171 --> 00:49:02,107
<i>You coming down here yourself?</i>

458
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:04,875
Nah, I think it'll be your mom.

459
00:49:06,211 --> 00:49:07,345
You'll talk to her for me?

460
00:49:07,478 --> 00:49:08,679
<i>I sure will.</i>

461
00:49:08,813 --> 00:49:10,381
<i>I'll straighten it all
out, no problem.</i>

462
00:49:11,582 --> 00:49:13,384
Yeah, okay. Good.

463
00:49:13,518 --> 00:49:16,921
<i>Jeff, you're gonna get the best
legal defense in the whole wide world.</i>

464
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:19,024
Trust your old man on that.

465
00:49:19,157 --> 00:49:21,292
<i>Okay, copy that. Sit tight.</i>

466
00:49:21,426 --> 00:49:22,893
You do that.

467
00:49:38,843 --> 00:49:39,963
Keep your shirt on.

468
00:49:41,346 --> 00:49:42,346
Hello?

469
00:49:44,515 --> 00:49:45,783
Gene.

470
00:49:45,916 --> 00:49:47,718
Gene, Honey, do you
know what time it is?

471
00:49:55,626 --> 00:49:58,296
Oh. Oh, God. That boy.

472
00:49:58,429 --> 00:50:00,198
He's gonna put me in my grave.

473
00:50:00,331 --> 00:50:02,033
Marion.

474
00:50:02,167 --> 00:50:03,634
It's a mistake, is all.

475
00:50:03,768 --> 00:50:05,079
Getting picked up for
something you didn't do?

476
00:50:05,103 --> 00:50:06,637
That could happen to anybody.

477
00:50:06,771 --> 00:50:08,273
<i>Yeah, right, anyone.</i>

478
00:50:08,406 --> 00:50:10,341
<i>This isn't the first
time, you know.</i>

479
00:50:10,475 --> 00:50:11,742
He's been in trouble before.

480
00:50:11,876 --> 00:50:12,876
Oh, Jesus.

481
00:50:12,943 --> 00:50:14,145
<i>- Marion...</i>
- The death of me.

482
00:50:14,279 --> 00:50:15,846
He's gonna be the death of me.

483
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:18,983
Marion. Marion, it's
gonna be all right.

484
00:50:19,117 --> 00:50:21,352
We'll get him outta
there lickety-split.

485
00:50:21,486 --> 00:50:23,621
<i>I've been through this before.</i>

486
00:50:23,754 --> 00:50:26,491
<i>There's nothing
lickety-split about it.</i>

487
00:50:26,624 --> 00:50:29,160
Back when he was
living in Albuquerque?

488
00:50:29,294 --> 00:50:32,163
Drunk in public,
resisting arrest,

489
00:50:32,297 --> 00:50:36,301
urinating in
someplace he shouldn't have.

490
00:50:36,434 --> 00:50:40,004
And me on the telephone
for hours, long distance,

491
00:50:40,138 --> 00:50:42,973
<i>trying to find him one
of those bail-out places.</i>

492
00:50:43,108 --> 00:50:45,210
<i>I maxed out my Discover card.</i>

493
00:50:45,343 --> 00:50:47,312
<i>I'm still paying for that one.</i>

494
00:50:47,445 --> 00:50:48,722
Well, money's not
gonna be a problem,

495
00:50:48,746 --> 00:50:50,781
'cause I'm gonna
help you with that.

496
00:50:50,915 --> 00:50:53,118
No. Gene, I can't
let you do that. No.

497
00:50:53,251 --> 00:50:55,886
<i>Sure you can.
Jeff'll pay me back.</i>

498
00:50:56,020 --> 00:50:58,100
And you don't have to worry
about a bondsman, either.

499
00:50:58,156 --> 00:50:59,324
Because guess what?

500
00:50:59,457 --> 00:51:01,692
In Omaha, they don't have 'em.

501
00:51:01,826 --> 00:51:03,370
All right? You just
walk into the station

502
00:51:03,394 --> 00:51:04,674
and you pay a
straight cash bail.

503
00:51:04,729 --> 00:51:06,497
It's not like
Albuquerque at all.

504
00:51:11,769 --> 00:51:14,004
<i>Marion, you still there?</i>

505
00:51:14,139 --> 00:51:15,840
Yeah. Why...

506
00:51:15,973 --> 00:51:19,510
Why did Jeff
call you instead of me?

507
00:51:19,644 --> 00:51:22,513
Well, I think he was
scared at how you'd take it.

508
00:51:22,647 --> 00:51:24,715
Honestly, I was gonna
pay the bail myself,

509
00:51:24,849 --> 00:51:26,427
but I think it should
be a family member.

510
00:51:26,451 --> 00:51:28,419
I think that'd be best.

511
00:51:28,553 --> 00:51:31,055
<i>I'll tell you what, I'm gonna
take a shower, get dressed.</i>

512
00:51:31,189 --> 00:51:32,257
<i>And you do the same.</i>

513
00:51:32,390 --> 00:51:33,858
<i>I'll swing by and pick you up.</i>

514
00:51:33,991 --> 00:51:35,551
<i>We'll get this whole
thing squared away.</i>

515
00:51:36,761 --> 00:51:39,197
Wh-what about Buddy?
Is he in any trouble?

516
00:51:40,731 --> 00:51:42,300
<i>I don't think so.</i>

517
00:51:42,433 --> 00:51:43,534
<i>Why would he be?</i>

518
00:51:46,404 --> 00:51:48,239
<i>I'll see you in about an hour.</i>

519
00:51:48,373 --> 00:51:49,840
Yeah, okay. Yeah. Thanks.

520
00:53:00,311 --> 00:53:01,612
Marion!

521
00:53:26,237 --> 00:53:27,237
Marion!

522
00:53:31,676 --> 00:53:33,177
Marion?

523
00:53:44,289 --> 00:53:45,289
Marion?

524
00:53:45,323 --> 00:53:47,024
- Oh!
- Hey.

525
00:53:47,157 --> 00:53:47,892
Hi.

526
00:53:48,025 --> 00:53:49,026
Oh, hey.

527
00:53:49,694 --> 00:53:50,728
Everything okay?

528
00:53:50,861 --> 00:53:52,029
Oh, yeah. I'm sorry.

529
00:53:52,162 --> 00:53:54,332
I... I just lost
track of the time.

530
00:53:55,933 --> 00:53:56,933
That's okay.

531
00:53:57,034 --> 00:53:59,169
Uh, you wanna
put some clothes on

532
00:53:59,304 --> 00:54:00,538
so that we can get moving?

533
00:54:00,671 --> 00:54:01,672
What do you say?

534
00:54:02,773 --> 00:54:05,410
Uh, you know, well, I, I...

535
00:54:05,543 --> 00:54:06,783
I don't wanna slow things down.

536
00:54:06,877 --> 00:54:08,846
I think maybe you
oughta go without me.

537
00:54:08,979 --> 00:54:10,524
<i>Partying, minding my own business.</i>

538
00:54:12,383 --> 00:54:14,285
<i>You are under arrest.</i>

539
00:54:14,419 --> 00:54:15,953
<i>I better call Saul!</i>

540
00:54:17,388 --> 00:54:18,856
<i>Hi. I'm Saul Goodman.</i>

541
00:54:18,989 --> 00:54:20,425
<i>Did you know that
you have rights?</i>

542
00:54:20,558 --> 00:54:23,328
<i>The Constitution says
you do, and so do I.</i>

543
00:54:23,461 --> 00:54:25,262
<i>I believe that,
until proven guilty,</i>

544
00:54:25,396 --> 00:54:28,433
<i>every man, woman, and
child in this country is innocent.</i>

545
00:54:28,566 --> 00:54:30,944
<i>And that's
why I fight for you, Albuquerque!</i>

546
00:54:30,968 --> 00:54:32,903
<i>Better Call Saul.</i>

547
00:54:33,037 --> 00:54:34,037
What's that?

548
00:54:35,172 --> 00:54:36,474
You tell me.

549
00:54:40,911 --> 00:54:42,151
Marion, do you think that's me?

550
00:54:44,382 --> 00:54:45,382
'Cause it's not.

551
00:54:47,785 --> 00:54:49,420
There never was
a Nippy, was there?

552
00:54:52,823 --> 00:54:54,525
What did Jeff tell you?

553
00:54:54,659 --> 00:54:56,126
Oh, he didn't tell me anything.

554
00:54:57,027 --> 00:54:58,596
Ask Jeeves told me.

555
00:55:00,998 --> 00:55:03,534
I typed in "con man"
and "Albuquerque,"

556
00:55:05,436 --> 00:55:07,938
and up you popped, big as day.

557
00:55:16,213 --> 00:55:17,482
What are you doing, Marion?

558
00:55:17,615 --> 00:55:19,655
What do you think I'm
doing? I'm calling the police.

559
00:55:20,418 --> 00:55:22,487
Here, lemme help you with that.

560
00:55:23,888 --> 00:55:25,065
Listen, I think
we're losing sight

561
00:55:25,089 --> 00:55:26,791
of the bigger
picture here, okay?

562
00:55:26,924 --> 00:55:28,926
Jeff is in trouble,
and I wanna help him.

563
00:55:29,059 --> 00:55:30,828
He and I sure could
use your support here.

564
00:55:30,961 --> 00:55:32,397
What did you get my son into?

565
00:55:32,530 --> 00:55:35,299
Nothing that he didn't ask for.

566
00:55:35,433 --> 00:55:37,802
Now, listen,

567
00:55:37,935 --> 00:55:40,805
I'm still the good friend
you thought I was, okay?

568
00:55:40,938 --> 00:55:44,174
Jeff understands me,
Buddy understands me.

569
00:55:44,308 --> 00:55:45,843
And you will, too.

570
00:55:45,976 --> 00:55:48,479
It's just, you have to, uh,

571
00:55:48,613 --> 00:55:51,782
you know, keep things
on an even keel, all right?

572
00:55:53,884 --> 00:55:55,486
- What have you got there?
- Uh...

573
00:55:56,787 --> 00:55:57,955
- Put that down.
- Huh...

574
00:55:59,924 --> 00:56:00,991
Put that down, Marion.

575
00:56:02,827 --> 00:56:03,827
Put it down.

576
00:56:05,996 --> 00:56:07,164
Do not do it, Marion.

577
00:56:09,634 --> 00:56:10,701
Final warning.

578
00:56:22,447 --> 00:56:23,614
I trusted you.

579
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:44,611
<i>Marion?
This is Valerie with Life Alert.</i>

580
00:56:44,635 --> 00:56:45,635
<i>Are you okay?</i>

581
00:56:45,736 --> 00:56:48,005
No, Valerie, I'm not okay.

582
00:56:48,138 --> 00:56:50,419
There's a criminal standing
in my kitchen, threatening me!

583
00:56:50,475 --> 00:56:51,776
He's a wanted man,

584
00:56:51,909 --> 00:56:54,411
and his name is Saul Goodman!

585
00:56:54,545 --> 00:56:56,481
<i>All right, Marion,
I'm calling the police.</i>

586
00:56:56,614 --> 00:56:57,648
<i>I'm calling right now.</i>

587
00:57:14,388 --> 00:57:16,388
