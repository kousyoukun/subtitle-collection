12
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:22,180
Yeah.

13
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:24,510
Do you have any idea what time it is?

14
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:27,640
Watched pot never boils, Francesca.

15
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,480
It's been an hour.

16
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:31,020
You've got a lobby full of people out here,

17
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:32,540
and at eight o'clock, I am done.

18
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:34,060
I don't care if the building burns down,

19
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:35,240
I'm going home.

20
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:37,420
Wow, you and your work ethic.

21
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:39,900
Did I ever tell you how indispensable you are?

22
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:40,660
No?

23
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:43,080
How much longer, Saul?

24
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:44,720
You know what? I can't say.

25
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:47,370
So pass along my sincerest apologies

26
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:49,340
and tell 'em I'm swamped.

27
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,340
Everyone can hear you bouncing that thing.

28
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:54,890
That's the sound of thinking.

29
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:56,750
You should try it sometime.

31
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:22,340
Yeah?

32
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:23,460
What are you waiting for?

33
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:24,410
Send her in.

35
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,620
How's it coming?

36
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,850
Good.

37
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:36,020
Did you get the mayonnaise?

38
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,420
Well, here's the thing,

39
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:41,400
they didn't have Duke's, and I really like Duke's.

40
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:45,130
But they didn't have it, which is a bummer. So...

41
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:48,060
I dunno.

42
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,230
Think this'll work?

43
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,710
I mean, technically, it isn't actually mayonnaise, but...

44
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:54,590
Yeah,

45
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:56,970
technically, I don't think this is mayonnaise.

46
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,240
But close, right?

47
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:02,460
What do you think? Should we give it a shot?

48
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:06,790
I dunno. What do you think?

49
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:12,910
Yeah.

50
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,500
Let's give it a shot.

51
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,760
Oh, my gosh.

52
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:24,200
I don't know. It's as close as I could get.

53
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:27,610
Cissy, garnet and gold! I see it plain as day.

54
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:30,430
Plus, they're really beautiful, Cissy.

55
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,850
Ah, the red ones could maybe pass for garnet.

56
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:35,010
But the "Gold" ones are just regular yellow.

57
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:38,270
Well, the minute I saw them I said, "FSU!"

58
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,220
Besides, gold food coloring?

59
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:42,820
June, did you ever even hear of that?

60
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:44,600
No! Sounds expensive.

61
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,690
And if they even make such a thing,

62
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:46,640
you'd probably get flipper-hands

63
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,490
from all the chemicals they'd put in it.

64
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,490
Well...

65
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,420
This is as close as I could get, anyway.

66
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:53,430
- Oh, it's perfect, Cissy. - Thank you.

67
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:55,250
- Oh, my gosh. - Ah, this is all so beautiful.

68
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:57,070
- Everything looks amazing. - Looks delicious.

69
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:58,520
- Oh, I forgot spoons. Sorry. - Well, let me tell you about epoxy--

70
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,560
Epoxy yellows.

71
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,850
You hit it with enough sunlight...

72
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:03,130
- No. Well-- - He's right.

73
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:03,930
- Wait, no. - No, he's right.

74
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:05,600
If you just use a dark enough floor--

75
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,340
Guys, I'm telling you, we're never gonna settle this.

76
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:10,640
I've been having this argument five days a week,

77
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:11,980
but now I'm Sweden.

78
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:13,460
- Switzerland. - You want something to drink?

79
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:15,530
- Wine coolers? - Great. Cissy?

80
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:16,830
Marvin doesn't like me to drink.

81
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:20,260
Cissy, we're gonna get a wine cooler down you one day.

82
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:27,850
That was fun.

83
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:29,470
Yeah. That was fun.

84
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:55,740
That's it right there.

85
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:56,960
Good job, guys.

86
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:00,800
"Peter the Great is buried inside me."

87
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,330
- "Find me in..." - What did she say?

88
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:03,360
We're gonna help each other.

89
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,470
Boy, you gotta be in shape to be on this show.

90
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:06,660
You sure do.

91
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:08,160
Lotsa running.

92
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:09,420
Yeah.

93
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:12,280
You think they ever ran with the bulls on this show?

94
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:13,390
Like, in Spain?

95
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:17,480
Not that we've seen, I don't think.

96
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,770
Maybe it's too dangerous.

97
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,250
What do you think?

98
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:25,950
Maybe.

99
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:28,760
Maybe.

100
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,510
Oh, I thought the potato salad worked out great.

101
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:43,900
- You think? - Yep.

102
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,280
Looks like rain again.

103
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:51,620
Yeah. Does.

104
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:59,210
Oh, hey, they opened a new Outback down in Satellite Beach.

105
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:00,950
- You wanna go Friday? - Sure.

106
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,470
It's a date.

108
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,600
I don't want to not buy her toys, but I also...

111
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:37,120
Could you tell me the flange diameter of 212-dash-17-backslash-H?

112
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:39,180
Great.

113
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:42,160
And does that come in a three-inch riser, or just the two-inch?

114
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:44,630
Great.

115
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:46,070
ABS or PVC?

116
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,430
Oh. Great.

117
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:08,600
We're gonna sing at 5:00.

118
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,880
Oh. Great.

119
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,340
Let me see.

122
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:20,420
That's cute, June.

123
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:22,510
I'll pick up the cake after lunch.

124
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:25,370
Do you remember what kind of ice cream Tammy likes?

125
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:30,500
- Uh... geez, no. - Yeah. So maybe... What do you think?

126
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,380
Vanilla?

127
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,650
Or strawberry?

128
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:40,940
They're both good.

129
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:42,260
I know, right?

130
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,960
- Five o'clock. - Okay, great.

131
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:50,480
No, nobody makes it that long.

132
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:53,070
Well, I mean, because-- I mean, think about it.

134
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:54,230
It's got to fit in the truck, right?

135
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:56,060
So, how's it gonna fit in the truck if--

136
00:09:57,830 --> 00:10:00,460
Well, yeah, but nobody makes a truck that long, so...

137
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,550
Safe to say.

138
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,440
Okay. Well, sorry we couldn't be of service.

139
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:10,340
So... whatever happened to crack?

140
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:12,480
How come you never hear about it on the news anymore?

141
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,920
Did everybody just all decide to stop taking it?

142
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,590
What's the drug that makes you dance around

143
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:18,160
and put a pacifier in your mouth?

144
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,980
- Ecstasy. - Ecstasy!

145
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:21,310
That's the big one now. I think that they have--

146
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:22,360
Yeah. That's the big one.

147
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,920
My sister's best friend's son?

148
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:25,140
Oh, my God...

149
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:26,920
But I don't understand the pacifier.

150
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,660
Why would they all need pacifiers?

151
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:30,630
Like, don't you think if you ran a store

152
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,240
and some teenager came in your store

153
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,200
and tried to buy a pacifier,

154
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,830
don't you think you'd call the police?

155
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:36,220
- Yeah. - Pbht! I sure would.

156
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:38,020
- Absolutely. - Whatcha eating?

157
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:39,920
Tuna salad.

158
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,250
I made it with Miracle Whip instead of mayonnaise.

159
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:46,180
I use almond butter instead of pean--

161
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:30,570
When I woke up this morning,

162
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:32,540
guess what was in my living room.

163
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:35,750
A freaking exercise bike.

164
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:39,360
Yeah. I can't believe he got that for my birthday.

165
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:41,320
Hold on a second.

166
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:46,530
Palm Coast Sprinkler, watering your world since 1978.

167
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,550
Please hold.

168
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:52,010
Yep?

169
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:54,990
Kim, there's a Viktor St. Claire for you on line three.

170
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:57,670
Kim?

171
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,150
Uh, yep. Okay.

172
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:02,670
Yeah. So, what do you think about that?

173
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:03,730
That's pretty rude.

174
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,690
What brand is it?

175
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,530
I don't care who made it.

176
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:13,830
I don't care if it's Megatron 3000 or worth $4 million.

177
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:16,390
I'm gonna ride it straight back to the store,

178
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:18,570
and guess what he's gonna get for his next birthday.

179
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:21,120
Some hair regrowth serum,

180
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,930
and I'm gonna laugh at him.

181
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,120
Yeah.

182
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:48,330
Kim Wexler.

183
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:49,450
Hey, Kim.

184
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:51,060
You know who this is?

185
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:57,400
I'm gonna take that as a yes.

186
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:01,860
Uh, that receptionist of yours,

187
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:03,340
is she the type to listen in?

188
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,950
- No. - Good.

189
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:08,160
Okay.

190
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,340
So, how's Florida been treating you?

191
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:13,550
I'm catching you between hurricanes, I hope.

192
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:16,830
Kim, you there?

193
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:23,960
What do you want?

194
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:28,450
I don't-- I don't want anything.

195
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,310
I just...

196
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:33,200
It's been a while, you know?

197
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,780
Just-- I'm thinking it's been a while,

198
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:39,550
and, um, might be nice to catch up.

199
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:42,450
- "Catch up." - Yeah.

200
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:44,860
My mind was wandering this morning. I was just...

201
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:47,600
Not thinking anything in particular. Just random thoughts.

202
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,480
And, bam, it suddenly occurred to me it's been six years.

203
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,200
I mean, Jesus.

204
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:55,000
I, I couldn't believe it.

205
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:07,030
I thought you might wanna know I'm still alive.

206
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:09,790
Yep.

207
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:13,440
I'm still out here, still getting away with it.

208
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,050
The feds couldn't find their own ass

209
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:16,980
with both hands and a proctologist.

210
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:18,450
You shouldn't be calling me.

211
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:20,080
Oh, hey! You're awake!

212
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,560
You shouldn't be calling.

213
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,080
Why not? What, am I tying up the line

214
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,940
for important irrigation business?

215
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:28,500
I mean, come on, Kim. Say something.

216
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,760
You can call me an asshole, yell at me.

217
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,990
Just let me know you've still got a pulse.

218
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,260
Just say something.

219
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,990
You want me to say something?

220
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:42,250
Yeah.

221
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:44,330
You should turn yourself in.

222
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,240
Do what?

223
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,030
You heard me.

224
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,030
I don't know what kind of life you've been living,

225
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:55,590
but it can't be much.

226
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,680
Said the pot to the kettle!

227
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:01,170
What-- That is--

228
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:04,620
That is really rich, you-- You preaching to me?

229
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:09,540
See, you have no idea what I did or didn't do, okay?

230
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,340
A-And why don't you turn yourself in,

231
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:14,660
seeing as how you're the one with the guilty conscience, huh?

232
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:16,720
What-- What is stopping you?

233
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:18,340
Fring's in the ground.

234
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:20,390
Mike's in the ground. Lalo's in the ground.

235
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:21,490
Apparently.

236
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:24,150
You don't have to hold back on my account.

237
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:26,350
They can only hang me once. So-- So go ahead.

238
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:29,580
Spill your guts! Put on your hair shirt, see what it gets you!

239
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:30,760
Why--

240
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,960
Kim, why are we even talking about this?

241
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:37,270
We're both too smart to throw our lives away for no reason.

242
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:38,220
Just...

243
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:42,010
I just... I only wanted to...

244
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,010
Kim.

245
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:48,780
Kim?

246
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,070
Kim.

247
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:54,440
I'm glad you're alive.

248
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:06,790
Yeah?

249
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,600
Time to sing!

250
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:09,960
Okay.

251
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:23,090
*Happy birthday to you*

252
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:27,760
*Happy birthday to you*

253
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:32,970
*Happy birthday, dear Tammy*

254
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:39,150
*Happy birthday to you*

257
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:26,270
I can't leave before the judge dismisses you.

258
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:27,390
I'll make sure they're aware.

259
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:29,560
Now, just remember to sit up straight

260
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,920
and listen carefully when the judge addresses you.

261
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,610
Stay attentive and engaged.

262
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:37,260
Even if you're not so sure what's going on, don't show it.

263
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,930
All right. Come here.

264
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,930
- Tuck your shirt in for me, will you? - Okay.

265
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,800
You gotta look good for the judge.

266
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:45,660
Because of your record...

267
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:13,290
Kim?

268
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,050
Hi, Cheryl.

269
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,090
I'm out front.

275
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:39,370
Howard was murdered?

276
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:46,660
Why?

277
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,510
He was...

278
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,210
in the wrong place at the wrong time.

279
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:09,970
Where's his body?

280
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:12,550
I don't know.

281
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,230
And the police?

282
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,050
Will they search again?

283
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,270
They'll search.

284
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,220
I don't think they'll find him.

285
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,390
Cheryl, he...

286
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:38,150
It-- it all happened in an instant.

287
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:40,830
And he didn't-- he didn't suffer.

288
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:48,780
"He didn't suffer."

289
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,260
The lies you two made up.

290
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,870
The picture you painted.

291
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,580
That's all he is now.

292
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:04,000
That's all anybody remembers.

293
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,240
I want to change that.

294
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:10,220
What happens now?

295
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:12,730
Will you be tried?

296
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:14,630
Will you go to jail?

297
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,140
I don't know.

298
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:20,120
You're a lawyer, right?

299
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:23,480
You're a-- A great one, Howard said!

300
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,630
How could you not know?

301
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:32,010
Bernalillo County has my affidavit.

302
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:35,140
It's up to the district attorney whether to prosecute.

303
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,010
And she may not.

304
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:42,280
Why?

305
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:47,090
There's no physical evidence.

306
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:51,280
No remaining witnesses other than my ex-husband,

307
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,150
assuming he's still alive.

308
00:23:56,150 --> 00:23:57,590
I could sue you in civil court.

309
00:23:57,590 --> 00:23:59,410
I could take everything you've got.

310
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:05,030
Yeah.

311
00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:11,940
Why are you doing this?

312
00:26:13,810 --> 00:26:15,640
Oh, God!

314
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:20,260
Passwords. Passwords...

315
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:31,880
A hat man.

317
00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:17,420
Holy shit.

318
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:37,980
Nothing to see here.

319
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:41,460
Move on.

320
00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:04,480
Look at this bullshit.

321
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:05,620
Look.

322
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,150
Look. What would you call this?

323
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:09,790
I'd call that...

324
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:11,520
I dunno, what?

325
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:14,120
Would you call that a fish taco?

326
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:17,120
Could anybody call this a fish taco? I mean, legally?

327
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:18,160
Stop waving that thing at me.

328
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,320
Look at this!

329
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,630
There's one piece of goddamned pollock

330
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:22,850
no bigger than the end of my thumb.

331
00:36:22,850 --> 00:36:24,390
Now, how can you even call that a--

332
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:25,380
Like am I s'posed to do something?

333
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:26,340
What do you want me to do about it?

334
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:29,140
Well, I want you to look inside there and tell me what you see.

335
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:33,870
W-Would you or would you not sell this to an unsuspecting public?

336
00:36:33,870 --> 00:36:35,230
Why do you persist in ordering fish

337
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:36,840
when we're 1,400 miles away from the nearest ocean?

338
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,780
Because it's on the menu, all right?

339
00:36:39,310 --> 00:36:42,230
Because I live in the 21st goddamn century, all right?

340
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:44,870
And this? This is some bullshit.

341
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:47,440
I'm telling you, I got half a mind to go on back over there

342
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,510
and smack somebody in their face there.

345
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:04,550
Yes!

346
00:38:58,890 --> 00:38:59,940
What do you think?

347
00:39:00,430 --> 00:39:01,500
Pretty great, right?

348
00:39:02,010 --> 00:39:03,060
Yeah, it's, um...

349
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:05,070
Yep.

350
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:08,690
I just need your printed name and signature.

351
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:14,930
So, Florida.

352
00:39:15,170 --> 00:39:17,070
Florida, Florida, Florida...

353
00:39:18,210 --> 00:39:19,290
Why there?

354
00:39:21,730 --> 00:39:23,330
- I guess-- - It doesn't matter.

355
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:25,290
Doesn't have to make sense.

356
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:29,480
Hey, I gotta tell you, I think you're gonna regret

357
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:31,710
not taking your share of the Sandpiper money.

358
00:39:32,530 --> 00:39:34,640
That'd buy a shitload of swampland.

359
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:47,000
I will, um,

360
00:39:48,530 --> 00:39:49,880
file these tomorrow.

361
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:51,690
All right. Well.

362
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,470
Have a nice life, Kim.

363
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:31,890
Hey, Sweetcheeks, who do we got next?

364
00:40:31,890 --> 00:40:33,250
Let's make some money!

365
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:35,980
Emilio Koyama!

366
00:40:41,010 --> 00:40:42,150
Where's your paperwork?

367
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,370
I don't do no paperwork.

368
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:47,120
He doesn't do paperwork!

369
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:48,870
Who cares? Come on, come on.

370
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:47,650
Hey, yo, could I bum one of those?

371
00:41:57,110 --> 00:41:58,080
Thanks.

372
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:12,740
What's up with this shit?

373
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:16,080
Rainy.

374
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:20,270
Yeah. No. It-- It's crazy.

375
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:22,970
It's like bananas, all this rain.

376
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:27,010
I mean, I thought we were, like, in a desert, you know?

377
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:38,100
You're a lawyer, right?

378
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:42,480
I recognize you.

379
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,720
You defended my buddy Combo.

380
00:42:48,530 --> 00:42:49,980
Christian Ortega.

381
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:52,600
Juvie court, stole a Baby Jesus.

382
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:54,560
I mean, not like a real baby, just a--

383
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:58,170
You know, one of those things outside of the church.

384
00:42:58,380 --> 00:42:59,810
- Nativity scene. - Yeah.

385
00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:00,890
Knights of Columbus.

386
00:43:01,970 --> 00:43:05,740
I mean, what the hell did he even want that thing for?

387
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:07,120
I mean, I-- I still don't know.

388
00:43:07,130 --> 00:43:08,230
Dumbass.

389
00:43:09,330 --> 00:43:10,910
I told him he could go to Hell

390
00:43:10,910 --> 00:43:12,410
for stealing something like that, I mean.

391
00:43:12,410 --> 00:43:14,320
But did he listen to me? No.

392
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:20,450
But you, you got him off, like, scot-free. That--

393
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:22,950
That was pretty slick, yo.

394
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:26,610
Well, tell him I hope he's keeping his nose clean.

395
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:27,970
Yeah, yeah, right on.

396
00:43:29,350 --> 00:43:30,660
Absolutely.

397
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:36,350
Hey, so, you having all this expertise and all...

398
00:43:37,310 --> 00:43:39,790
This guy Goodman?

399
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:41,720
He the real deal?

400
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:43,270
Like, lawyer-wise?

401
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:44,780
Why do you ask?

402
00:43:49,410 --> 00:43:52,240
I got a buddy in there who's facing some serious time.

403
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:54,750
I mean, not-- you know, not Baby Jesus-time,

404
00:43:54,750 --> 00:43:56,830
but... but serious.

405
00:43:56,990 --> 00:43:59,940
You know, he needs top-shelf legal representation.

406
00:44:00,190 --> 00:44:01,380
And I tell him that, right?

407
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:04,350
But, you know, he sees this dude's commercials on TV

408
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:06,140
and this is where he wants to go.

409
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:10,890
And I tell him, "Yo, Emilio, you know, a funny TV commercial

410
00:44:10,890 --> 00:44:14,370
is not a sound basis for, like, you know..."

411
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:17,750
I mean, like, would you go to doctor to do, like,

412
00:44:17,750 --> 00:44:19,940
an operation on you in like a--

413
00:44:20,230 --> 00:44:22,440
on, like, your spleen or whatever

414
00:44:23,430 --> 00:44:25,700
on the fact of a funny TV commercial?

415
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:27,130
No. I mean, come on.

416
00:44:27,390 --> 00:44:29,050
How is this any different?

417
00:44:29,570 --> 00:44:30,490
You know?

418
00:44:34,930 --> 00:44:35,930
Anyway...

419
00:44:38,390 --> 00:44:40,850
Is this guy any good?

420
00:44:49,910 --> 00:44:51,530
When I knew him, he was.

421
00:47:11,910 --> 00:47:12,950
Hello?

422
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:14,940
Hey, uh, Dad?

423
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:17,680
It's me. It's-- It's Jeff.

424
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:20,080
Jeff? What time is it?

425
00:47:20,210 --> 00:47:21,510
Are you okay?

426
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:24,080
Yeah, no, not really.

427
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:26,070
Um, I, uh...

428
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,270
Dad, I got arrested.

429
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:29,330
Oh, no.

430
00:47:29,330 --> 00:47:31,370
What for? Jeffie.

431
00:47:31,370 --> 00:47:33,310
It's like this crazy mistake, you know?

432
00:47:33,310 --> 00:47:35,090
I mean, I had an accident, okay?

433
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:38,450
A, a little fender-bender type deal, no, no big thing.

434
00:47:38,450 --> 00:47:40,810
My foot maybe slipped on the accelerator,

435
00:47:40,810 --> 00:47:43,960
or maybe it was a defective-- I dunno.

436
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:46,510
But that's not the big-deal part.

437
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:48,680
The big-deal part is,

438
00:47:49,020 --> 00:47:54,400
they think that I, me, committed a robbery.

439
00:47:54,490 --> 00:47:56,110
And why would they think that?

440
00:47:56,230 --> 00:47:57,590
I know, right?

441
00:47:57,920 --> 00:47:59,290
The place where I had the accident?

442
00:47:59,290 --> 00:48:01,110
This guy? This drunk guy?

443
00:48:01,110 --> 00:48:02,760
He comes wandering out of his house

444
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:05,580
and flags down the cops, the, the police, and says,

445
00:48:05,580 --> 00:48:07,640
"Hey, you know, I got robbed!"

446
00:48:07,950 --> 00:48:09,980
And sure enough, the police?

447
00:48:10,070 --> 00:48:14,660
They find evidence of, like, breaking and entering.

448
00:48:14,660 --> 00:48:18,360
And, and, and stuff is missing, which I did not do.

449
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:23,150
And, uh... yeah. Like that.

450
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:26,570
Well, the police are obviously barking up the wrong tree.

451
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:28,130
Yeah. No shit, wrong tree!

452
00:48:28,130 --> 00:48:31,060
- Wrong, like, forest. - Exactly.

453
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:33,290
Because you would never do something like that,

454
00:48:33,290 --> 00:48:34,440
would you, son?

455
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:37,060
No. No. No way, man. Absolutely not.

456
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:39,240
Uh, when the police took you into custody,

457
00:48:39,380 --> 00:48:42,240
did they find any of this so-called stolen merchandise?

458
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:43,820
Was it in your possession?

459
00:48:43,860 --> 00:48:45,760
- No. - Of course it wasn't.

460
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:47,710
Because you didn't steal anything.

461
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:50,330
Therefore, since there's no evidence whatsoever

462
00:48:50,330 --> 00:48:51,640
that you committed any crime,

463
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:53,900
I'd say you got nothing to worry about.

464
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:55,940
So, what happens next?

465
00:48:56,260 --> 00:48:58,210
Breathe deep and sit tight.

466
00:48:58,210 --> 00:48:59,880
I'll have you out by lunchtime.

467
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:01,540
You coming down here yourself?

468
00:49:02,270 --> 00:49:04,660
Nah, I think it'll be your mom.

469
00:49:05,890 --> 00:49:07,140
You'll talk to her for me?

470
00:49:07,140 --> 00:49:08,240
I sure will.

471
00:49:08,340 --> 00:49:10,900
I'll straighten it all out, no problem.

472
00:49:11,570 --> 00:49:12,690
Yeah, okay. Good.

473
00:49:13,210 --> 00:49:14,240
Jeff, you're gonna get

474
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:16,790
the best legal defense in the whole wide world.

475
00:49:16,790 --> 00:49:18,770
Trust your old man on that.

476
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:21,180
Okay, copy that. Sit tight.

477
00:49:21,180 --> 00:49:22,420
You do that.

478
00:49:38,580 --> 00:49:40,010
Keep your shirt on.

479
00:49:41,170 --> 00:49:42,210
Hello?

480
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:45,550
Gene.

481
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:48,090
Gene, Honey, do you know what time it is?

482
00:49:56,780 --> 00:49:57,990
Oh. Oh, God. That boy.

483
00:49:58,260 --> 00:50:00,170
He's gonna put me in my grave.

484
00:50:00,170 --> 00:50:01,130
Marion.

485
00:50:01,860 --> 00:50:03,280
It's a mistake, is all.

486
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:04,820
Getting picked up for something you didn't do?

487
00:50:04,830 --> 00:50:06,560
That could happen to anybody.

488
00:50:06,570 --> 00:50:08,000
Yeah, right, anyone.

489
00:50:08,190 --> 00:50:10,000
This isn't the first time, you know.

490
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,620
He's been in trouble before.

491
00:50:11,620 --> 00:50:12,660
Oh, Jesus.

492
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:14,210
- Marion... - The death of me.

493
00:50:14,210 --> 00:50:15,850
He's gonna be the death of me.

494
00:50:15,850 --> 00:50:18,860
Marion. Marion, it's gonna be all right.

495
00:50:18,910 --> 00:50:21,070
We'll get him outta there lickety-split.

496
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:23,430
I've been through this before.

497
00:50:23,430 --> 00:50:26,110
There's nothing lickety-split about it.

498
00:50:26,250 --> 00:50:28,630
Back when he was living in Albuquerque?

499
00:50:29,090 --> 00:50:31,960
Drunk in public, resisting arrest,

500
00:50:32,170 --> 00:50:36,100
urinating in someplace he shouldn't have.

501
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:40,070
And me on the telephone for hours, long distance,

502
00:50:40,070 --> 00:50:42,920
trying to find him one of those bail-out places.

503
00:50:42,930 --> 00:50:45,290
I maxed out my Discover card.

504
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:47,000
I'm still paying for that one.

505
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,490
Well, money's not gonna be a problem,

506
00:50:48,490 --> 00:50:49,860
'cause I'm gonna help you with that.

507
00:50:50,740 --> 00:50:52,910
No. Gene, I can't let you do that. No.

508
00:50:52,930 --> 00:50:55,830
Sure you can. Jeff'll pay me back.

509
00:50:55,830 --> 00:50:57,770
And you don't have to worry about a bondsman, either.

510
00:50:57,770 --> 00:50:59,030
Because guess what?

511
00:50:59,130 --> 00:51:01,190
In Omaha, they don't have 'em.

512
00:51:01,530 --> 00:51:03,050
All right? You just walk into the station

513
00:51:03,050 --> 00:51:04,400
and you pay a straight cash bail.

514
00:51:04,410 --> 00:51:06,440
It's not like Albuquerque at all.

515
00:51:11,740 --> 00:51:13,140
Marion, you still there?

516
00:51:13,770 --> 00:51:14,870
Yeah. Why--

517
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:19,230
Why did Jeff call you instead of me?

518
00:51:19,330 --> 00:51:21,720
Well, I think he was scared at how you'd take it.

519
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:24,540
Honestly, I was gonna pay the bail myself,

520
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:26,260
but I think it should be a family member.

521
00:51:26,260 --> 00:51:27,560
I think that'd be best.

522
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:30,940
I'll tell you what, I'm gonna take a shower, get dressed.

523
00:51:30,940 --> 00:51:32,230
And you do the same.

524
00:51:32,250 --> 00:51:33,670
I'll swing by and pick you up.

525
00:51:33,670 --> 00:51:35,700
We'll get this whole thing squared away.

526
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:39,530
Wh-what about Buddy? Is he in any trouble?

527
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:42,170
I don't think so.

528
00:51:42,290 --> 00:51:43,530
Why would he be?

529
00:51:46,170 --> 00:51:47,730
I'll see you in about an hour.

530
00:51:48,370 --> 00:51:50,120
Yeah, okay. Yeah. Thanks.

531
00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:20,020
*Oh, no, oh*

532
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:21,790
*The tide i--*

533
00:52:21,790 --> 00:52:24,910
*That tease and hurt me bad*

534
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:29,900
*But it's the way you do the things you do to me*

535
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:32,750
*I'm not the kinda girl*

536
00:52:32,750 --> 00:52:36,850
*Who gives up just like that*

537
00:52:37,340 --> 00:52:39,930
*Oh, no, oh*

538
00:52:40,140 --> 00:52:42,020
*The tide is high*

539
00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:44,860
*But I'm holding on*

540
00:52:45,220 --> 00:52:48,560
*I'm gonna be your num--*

541
00:52:56,610 --> 00:53:00,600
*I'm not the kinda girl who gives up*

542
00:53:00,730 --> 00:53:01,750
Marion!

543
00:53:03,410 --> 00:53:05,550
*Just like that*

544
00:53:06,210 --> 00:53:07,480
*Oh, no*

545
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:27,150
Marion!

546
00:53:31,590 --> 00:53:32,570
Marion?

547
00:53:44,060 --> 00:53:45,080
Marion?

548
00:53:49,570 --> 00:53:50,820
Everything okay?

549
00:53:50,820 --> 00:53:51,810
Oh, yeah. I'm sorry.

550
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:54,840
I-- I just lost track of the time.

551
00:53:55,580 --> 00:53:56,700
That's okay.

552
00:53:57,900 --> 00:53:59,090
Uh, you wanna put some clothes on

553
00:53:59,090 --> 00:54:00,340
so that we can get moving?

554
00:54:00,340 --> 00:54:01,570
What do you say?

555
00:54:03,580 --> 00:54:05,160
Uh, you know, well, I, I...

556
00:54:05,300 --> 00:54:06,650
I don't wanna slow things down.

557
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:08,790
I think maybe you oughta go without me.

558
00:54:08,860 --> 00:54:11,360
...partying, minding my own business.

559
00:54:12,510 --> 00:54:14,220
You are under arrest.

560
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:15,960
I better call Saul!

561
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:18,420
Hi. I'm Saul Goodman.

562
00:54:18,420 --> 00:54:20,080
Did you know that you have rights?

563
00:54:20,330 --> 00:54:23,210
The Constitution says you do, and so do I.

564
00:54:23,210 --> 00:54:25,320
I believe that, until proven guilty,

565
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:28,640
every man, woman, and child in this country is innocent.

566
00:54:28,670 --> 00:54:30,760
And that's why I fight for you, Albuquerque!

567
00:54:32,750 --> 00:54:33,840
What's that?

568
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:36,650
You tell me.

569
00:54:40,730 --> 00:54:42,550
Marion, do you think that's me?

570
00:54:44,220 --> 00:54:45,340
'Cause it's not.

571
00:54:47,530 --> 00:54:49,610
There never was a Nippy, was there?

572
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:54,200
What did Jeff tell you?

573
00:54:54,340 --> 00:54:55,890
Oh, he didn't tell me anything.

574
00:54:56,890 --> 00:54:58,850
Ask Jeeves told me.

575
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:03,820
I typed in "Con man" and "Albuquerque,"

576
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:08,500
and up you popped, big as day.

577
00:55:16,060 --> 00:55:17,100
What are you doing, Marion?

578
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:19,670
What do you think I'm doing? I'm calling the police.

579
00:55:20,220 --> 00:55:22,130
Here, lemme help you with that.

580
00:55:23,590 --> 00:55:24,790
Listen, I think we're losing sight

581
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:26,440
of the bigger picture here, okay?

582
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:28,780
Jeff is in trouble, and I wanna help him.

583
00:55:28,780 --> 00:55:30,710
He and I sure could use your support here.

584
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:32,420
What did you get my son into?

585
00:55:32,420 --> 00:55:35,030
Nothing that he didn't ask for.

586
00:55:35,690 --> 00:55:37,450
Now, listen,

587
00:55:37,660 --> 00:55:40,500
I'm still the good friend you thought I was, okay?

588
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:43,940
Jeff understands me, Buddy understands me.

589
00:55:44,060 --> 00:55:45,330
And you will, too.

590
00:55:45,970 --> 00:55:48,010
It's just, you have to, uh,

591
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:52,000
you know, keep things on an even keel, all right?

592
00:55:53,670 --> 00:55:55,090
What have you got there?

593
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:57,570
Put that down.

594
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:01,240
Put that down, Marion.

595
00:56:02,660 --> 00:56:03,870
Put it down.

596
00:56:05,710 --> 00:56:07,530
Do not do it, Marion.

597
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:10,570
Final warning.

598
00:56:22,150 --> 00:56:23,640
I trusted you.

599
00:56:42,430 --> 00:56:44,500
Marion? This is Valerie with Life Alert.

600
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:45,490
Are you okay?

601
00:56:45,490 --> 00:56:47,670
No, Valerie, I'm not okay.

602
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:50,330
There's a criminal standing in my kitchen, threatening me!

603
00:56:50,330 --> 00:56:51,730
He's a wanted man,

604
00:56:51,890 --> 00:56:54,050
and his name is Saul Goodman!

605
00:56:54,390 --> 00:56:56,300
All right, Marion, I'm calling the police.

606
00:56:56,300 --> 00:56:57,650
I'm calling right now.
