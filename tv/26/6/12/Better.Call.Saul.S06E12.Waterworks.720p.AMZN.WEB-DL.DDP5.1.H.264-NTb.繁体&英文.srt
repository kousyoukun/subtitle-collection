Wow, you and your work ethic.

21
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:39,900
我沒告訴過你  缺你不可嗎
Did I ever tell you how indispensable you are?

22
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:40,660
沒有嗎
No?

你買蛋黃醬了嗎
Did you get the mayonnaise?

38
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,420
是這樣的
Well, here's the thing,

39
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:41,400
他們沒有杜克牌的了  我非常喜歡杜克牌
they didn't have Duke's, and I really like Duke's.

40
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:45,130
可是他們沒有  有點掃興
But they didn't have it, which is a bummer. So...

41
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:48,060
我也不懂
I dunno.

42
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,230
你覺得這個行嗎
Think this'll work?

43
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,710
嚴格說來  這不是真正的蛋黃醬  但...
I mean, technically, it isn't actually mayonnaise, but...

44
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:54,590
嗯
Yeah,

45
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:56,970
嚴格說來  我認為這不是蛋黃醬
technically, I don't think this is mayonnaise.

46
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,240
但是類似吧
But close, right?

47
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:02,460
你覺得呢  要不要試試
What do you think? Should we give it a shot?

48
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:06,790
我也不知道  你覺得呢
I dunno. What do you think?

49
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:12,910
嗯
Yeah.

50
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,500
咱們試試
Let's give it a shot.

51
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,760
天啊
Oh, my gosh.

52
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:24,200
我也說不好  我盡力了
I don't know. It's as close as I could get.

53
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:27,610
西西  石榴紅配金色  太明顯了
Cissy, garnet and gold! I see it plain as day.

54
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:30,430
而且  這也太漂亮了  西西
Plus, they're really beautiful, Cissy.

55
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,850
紅色的還能冒充一下石榴紅
Ah, the red ones could maybe pass for garnet.

56
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:35,010
但是金色的就是普通的黃色
But the "Gold" ones are just regular yellow.

57
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:38,270
我一看見就脫口而出"佛羅里達州立大學隊"
Well, the minute I saw them I said, "FSU!"

June, did you ever even hear of that?

60
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:44,600
沒有  聽著就貴
No! Sounds expensive.

61
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,690
就算真有這種東西
And if they even make such a thing,

62
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:46,640
那里邊的添加劑
you'd probably get flipper-hands

63
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,490
很可能會害你手上長蹼
from all the chemicals they'd put in it.

64
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,490
好吧
Well...

70
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,560
環氧樹脂會發黃
Epoxy yellows.

71
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,850
它暴露在陽光下...
You hit it with enough sunlight...

72
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:03,130
-不  -他說得對
- No. Well-- - He's right.

73
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:03,930
-不是吧  -是的  他說得沒錯

That was fun.

83
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:29,470
沒錯  是很有趣
Yeah. That was fun.

84
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:55,740
對了  就是那
That's it right there.

85
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:56,960
干得好  朋友們
Good job, guys.

88
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:03,360
我們得互相幫助

Like, in Spain?

95
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:17,480
應該是沒見過
Not that we've seen, I don't think.

96
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,770
也許太危險了
Maybe it's too dangerous.

97
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,250

00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:12,480
怎么現在新聞上見不到了呢
How come you never hear about it on the news anymore?

141
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,920
大家都不吸了那東西了嗎
Did everybody just all decide to stop taking it?

142
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,590
那個讓你跳舞還要吸奶嘴的毒品
What's the drug that makes you dance around

143
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:18,160
叫什么來著
and put a pacifier in your mouth?

144
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,980
-搖頭丸  -搖頭丸
- Ecstasy. - Ecstasy!

145
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:21,310
現在這個可流行了  我想他們
That's the big one now. I think that they have--

146
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:22,360
沒錯  可流行了
Yeah. That's the big one.

147
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,920
我姐妹閨蜜的兒子
My sister's best friend's son?

148
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:25,140
天啊
Oh, my God...

149
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:26,920
但我不懂奶嘴的事
But I don't understand the pacifier.

150
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,660
為什么他們都需要奶嘴
Why would they all need pacifiers?

151
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:30,630
如果你是商店老板
Like, don't you think if you ran a store

152
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,240
青少年闖進店里
and some teenager came in your store

153
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,200
想買奶嘴
and tried to buy a pacifier,

154
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,830
難道你不報警嗎
don't you think you'd call the police?

155
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:36,220
-是啊  -要我肯定會
- Yeah. - Pbht! I sure would.

156
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:38,020
-絕對的  -你在吃什么
- Absolutely. - Whatcha eating?

157
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:39,920
金槍魚沙拉
Tuna salad.

158
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,250
我用奇妙沙拉醬做的  而不是蛋黃醬
I made it with Miracle Whip instead of mayonnaise.

159
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:46,180
我用杏仁醬而不是花生醬
I use almond butter instead of pean--

160
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:06,920
{\an8}棕櫚海岸灑水器
開啟了新篇章...

161
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:30,570
我今早醒來時
When I woke up this morning,

162
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:32,540
猜我客廳里有什么
guess what was in my living room.

163
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:35,750
居然有一輛健身單車
A freaking exercise bike.

164
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:39,360
難以置信那是他給我的生日禮物
Yeah. I can't believe he got that for my birthday.

165
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:41,320
等等
Hold on a second.

166
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:46,530
棕櫚海岸灑水器  從1978年開始澆灌你的世界
Palm Coast Sprinkler, watering your world since 1978.

167
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,550
稍等
Please hold.

168
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:52,010
什么事
Yep?

169
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:54,990
金  維克多·圣克萊爾找你  三號線
Kim, there's a Viktor St. Claire for you on line three.

170
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:57,670
金
Kim?

171
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,150
好的
Uh, yep. Okay.

172
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:02,670
你怎么看
Yeah. So, what do you think about that?

173
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:03,730
真的很不禮貌
That's pretty rude.

174
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,690
什么牌子
What brand is it?

175
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,530
我才不管誰造的呢
I don't care who made it.

176
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:13,830
我才不管是威震天三千還是值四百萬呢
I don't care if it's Megatron 3000 or worth $4 million.

177
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:16,390
我要直接騎著送回店里去
I'm gonna ride it straight back to the store,

178
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:18,570
你猜他會收到什么生日禮物
and guess what he's gonna get for his next birthday.

179
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:21,120
生發精華吧
Some hair regrowth serum,

180
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,930
我還要取笑他
and I'm gonna laugh at him.

181
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,120
沒錯
Yeah.

182
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:48,330
我是金·韋克斯勒
Kim Wexler.

183
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:49,450
你好  金
Hey, Kim.

184
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:51,060
你知道我是誰嗎
You know who this is?

185
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:57,400
我就當你知道了
I'm gonna take that as a yes.

186
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:01,860
你們那位前臺
Uh, that receptionist of yours,

187
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:03,340
她是喜歡偷聽的人嗎
is she the type to listen in?

188
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,950
-不是  -那就好
- No. - Good.

189
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:08,160
好的
Okay.

190
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,340
你在佛羅里達過得還好嗎
So, how's Florida been treating you?

191
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:13,550
希望這會兒沒有颶風
I'm catching you between hurricanes, I hope.

192
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:16,830
金  你在聽嗎
Kim, you there?

193
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:23,960
你有什么事
What do you want?

194
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:28,450
我...沒什么事
I don't-- I don't want anything.

195
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,310
就是
I just...

196
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:33,200
很久沒聯絡了
It's been a while, you know?

197
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,780
我想著我們很久沒聯絡了
Just-- I'm thinking it's been a while,

198
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:39,550
敘敘舊也挺好的
and, um, might be nice to catch up.

199
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:42,450
-"敘舊"  -是的
- "Catch up." - Yeah.

200
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:44,860
今早我思緒神游
My mind was wandering this morning. I was just...

201
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:47,600
沒想什么特別的事  就是胡思亂想
Not thinking anything in particular. Just random thoughts.

202
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,480
我突然發覺已經過去六年了
And, bam, it suddenly occurred to me it's been six years.

203
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,200
天啊
I mean, Jesus.

204
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:55,000
真不敢相信
I, I couldn't believe it.

205
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:07,030
你可能想知道我還活著
I thought you might wanna know I'm still alive.

206
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:09,790
對
Yep.

207
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:13,440
我好好的  仍然逍遙法外
I'm still out here, still getting away with it.

208
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,050
聯調局那些笨蛋連自己的屁股都找不到
The feds couldn't find their own ass

209
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:16,980
更別說抓我了
with both hands and a proctologist.

210
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:18,450
你不該打給我
You shouldn't be calling me.

211
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:20,080
你醒了
Oh, hey! You're awake!

212
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,560
你不該打來
You shouldn't be calling.

213
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,080
為什么  我占線
Why not? What, am I tying up the line

214
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,940
影響重要的灌溉業務了嗎
for important irrigation business?

215
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:28,500
拜托  金  說句話吧
I mean, come on, Kim. Say something.

216
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,760
你可以罵我混蛋  沖我發火
You can call me an asshole, yell at me.

217
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,990
讓我知道你依然有一口氣
Just let me know you've still got a pulse.

218
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,260
說句話啊
Just say something.

219
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,990
你想要我開口
You want me to say something?

220
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:42,250
是的
Yeah.

221
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:44,330
你應該去自首
You should turn yourself in.

222
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,240
什么
Do what?

223
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,030
你聽見了
You heard me.

224
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,030
我不知道你一直過著什么樣的生活
I don't know what kind of life you've been living,

225
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:55,590
但肯定沒多風光
but it can't be much.

226
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,680
真是五十步笑百步
Said the pot to the kettle!

227
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:01,170
簡直...
What-- That is--

228
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:04,620
荒謬至極  你竟然對我說教
That is really rich, you-- You preaching to me?

229
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:09,540
你并不知道我做過或沒做過什么
See, you have no idea what I did or didn't do, okay?

230
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,340
再說了  你怎么不去自首
A-And why don't you turn yourself in,

231
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:14,660
既然你那么有罪惡感
seeing as how you're the one with the guilty conscience, huh?

232
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:16,720
是什么阻止了你
What-- What is stopping you?

233
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:18,340
弗林死了
Fring's in the ground.

234
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:20,390
麥克死了  拉羅也死了
Mike's in the ground. Lalo's in the ground.

235
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:21,490
聽說是這樣
Apparently.

236
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:24,150
你不必為了我而猶豫不決
You don't have to hold back on my account.

237
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:26,350
他們只能處死我一次  所以你盡管去吧
They can only hang me once. So-- So go ahead.

238
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:29,580
全說出來  自我懲罰吧  看對你有什么好處
Spill your guts! Put on your hair shirt, see what it gets you!

239
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:30,760
為...
Why--

240
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,960
金  我們為什么說起自首
Kim, why are we even talking about this?

241
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:37,270
我們都很聰明  不會無緣無故毀掉自己人生
We're both too smart to throw our lives away for no reason.

242
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:38,220
我...
Just...

243
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:42,010
我只是想...
I just... I only wanted to...

244
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,010
金
Kim.

245
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:48,780
金
Kim?

246
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,070
金
Kim.

247
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:54,440
我很高興你還活著
I'm glad you're alive.

248
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:06,790
什么事
Yeah?

249
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,600
該唱歌了
Time to sing!

250
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:09,960
好的
Okay.

251
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:23,090
*祝你生日快樂*
*Happy birthday to you*

252
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:27,760
*祝你生日快樂*
*Happy birthday to you*

253
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:32,970
*祝你生日快樂  親愛的譚美*
*Happy birthday, dear Tammy*

254
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:39,150
*祝你生日快樂*
*Happy birthday to you*

255
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:11,530
{\an8}阿拉斯加

256
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:16,290
{\an8}阿爾布開克

257
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:26,270
法官讓你走之前我不能離開
I can't leave before the judge dismisses you.

258
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:27,390
我保證讓他們知道
I'll make sure they're aware.

259
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:29,560
就記住坐直身子
Now, just remember to sit up straight

260
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,920
法官跟你說話時認真聽
and listen carefully when the judge addresses you.

261
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,610
保持專心  注意力集中
Stay attentive and engaged.

262
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:37,260
就算你不確定發生什么事了  也別表現出來
Even if you're not so sure what's going on, don't show it.

263
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,930
好了  過來
All right. Come here.

264
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,930
-把襯衫下擺掖進褲子里去  -好的
- Tuck your shirt in for me, will you? - Okay.

265
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,800
你要給法官一個好印象
You gotta look good for the judge.

266
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:45,660
因為你有前科
Because of your record...

267
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:13,290
金
Kim?

268
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,050
你好  謝麗爾
Hi, Cheryl.

269
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,090
我在門口
I'm out front.

270
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:41,550
{\an8}塞拉曼加離開后不久  吉米和我就開始謀劃一次長期行動  讓人懷疑霍華德·哈姆林的品格

271
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:48,080
{\an8}為了私利...
破壞霍華德...

272
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:52,860
{\an8}假造他可卡因成癮

273
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:06,770
{\an8}塞拉曼加進入了我們家...  頭部中槍  霍華德立即死亡

274
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:19,850
{\an8}我按照指示  開車去弗林家
厄門紹特毀滅證據...
...偽裝成自殺...

275
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:39,370
霍華德是被人殺害的
Howard was murdered?

276
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:46,660
為什么
Why?

277
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,510
他...
He was...

278
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,210
不該在那時出現在那里
in the wrong place at the wrong time.

279
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:09,970
他的尸體在哪
Where's his body?

280
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:12,550
我不知道
I don't know.

281
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,230
警方呢
And the police?

282
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,050
會再搜尋嗎
Will they search again?

283
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,270
會的
They'll search.

284
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,220
我覺得他們應該找不到
I don't think they'll find him.

285
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,390
謝麗爾  他...
Cheryl, he...

286
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:38,150
都發生在一瞬間
It-- it all happened in an instant.

287
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:40,830
他沒有受苦
And he didn't-- he didn't suffer.

288
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:48,780
"他沒有受苦"
"He didn't suffer."

289
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,260
你倆編出的謊言
The lies you two made up.

290
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,870
你們描繪出的那個他
The picture you painted.

291
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,580
他現在完全是那個人了
That's all he is now.

292
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:04,000
所有人只記得那樣的他
That's all anybody remembers.

293
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,240
我想改變現狀
I want to change that.

294
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:10,220
接下來會怎么樣
What happens now?

295
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:12,730
你會受審嗎
Will you be tried?

296
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:14,630
你會坐牢嗎
Will you go to jail?

297
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,140
我不知道
I don't know.

298
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:20,120
你是律師  對嗎
You're a lawyer, right?

299
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:23,480
你是個了不起的律師  霍華德說的
You're a-- A great one, Howard said!

300
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,630
你怎么能不知道
How could you not know?

301
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:32,010
我把宣誓口供交給了伯納利歐縣
Bernalillo County has my affidavit.

302
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:35,140
是否起訴要看地檢官
It's up to the district attorney whether to prosecute.

303
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,010
她可能不會起訴
And she may not.

304
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:42,280
為什么
Why?

305
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:47,090
沒有確鑿證據
There's no physical evidence.

306
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:51,280
除了我的前夫以外沒有證人
No remaining witnesses other than my ex-husband,

307
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,150
如果我的前夫還活著的話
assuming he's still alive.

308
00:23:56,150 --> 00:23:57,590
我可以在民事法庭起訴你
I could sue you in civil court.

309
00:23:57,590 --> 00:23:59,410
我可以拿走你的一切
I could take everything you've got.

310
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:05,030
對
Yeah.

311
00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:11,940
你為什么這么做
Why are you doing this?

312
00:26:13,810 --> 00:26:15,640
天啊
Oh, God!

313
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:03,030
{\an8}投資報告

314
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:20,260
密碼  密碼
Passwords. Passwords...

315
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:31,880
一個帽子收藏家
A hat man.

316
00:32:57,510 --> 00:33:05,170
{\an8}自由奔跑吧  銹銹

317
00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:17,420
該死
Holy shit.

318
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:37,980
這里沒什么好看的
Nothing to see here.

319
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:41,460
走吧
Move on.

320
00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:04,480
看看這破玩意
Look at this bullshit.

321
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:05,620
看啊
Look.

322
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,150
看  你管這叫什么
Look. What would you call this?

323
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:09,790
我...
I'd call that...

324
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:11,520
我不知道  什么
I dunno, what?

325
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:14,120
這叫魚肉玉米卷餅嗎
Would you call that a fish taco?

326
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:17,120
誰管這叫魚肉玉米卷餅啊  合法嗎
Could anybody call this a fish taco? I mean, legally?

327
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:18,160
別在我面前晃悠它了
Stop waving that thing at me.

328
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,320
看看它
Look at this!

329
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,630
只有一片鱈魚
There's one piece of goddamned pollock

330
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:22,850
還沒我大拇指尖大呢
no bigger than the end of my thumb.

331
00:36:22,850 --> 00:36:24,390
怎么能管它叫...
Now, how can you even call that a--

332
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:25,380
你跟我說有用嗎
Like am I s'posed to do something?

333
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:26,340
你想讓我怎么辦
What do you want me to do about it?

334
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:29,140
我想讓你看看  告訴我你看到了什么
Well, I want you to look inside there and tell me what you see.

335
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:33,870
你會不會把這玩意賣給毫無防備的百姓
W-Would you or would you not sell this to an unsuspecting public?

336
00:36:33,870 --> 00:36:35,230
你為什么堅持點魚肉
Why do you persist in ordering fish

337
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:36,840
我們離最近的海有2200多公里
when we're 1,400 miles away from the nearest ocean?

338
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,780
因為菜單上有魚肉  明白嗎
Because it's on the menu, all right?

339
00:36:39,310 --> 00:36:42,230
因為我活在21世紀  明白嗎
Because I live in the 21st goddamn century, all right?

340
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:44,870
這玩意就是屎
And this? This is some bullshit.

341
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:47,440
我跟你說  我恨不得回去
I'm telling you, I got half a mind to go on back over there

342
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,510
扇人一耳光
and smack somebody in their face there.

343
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:50,990
{\an8}離婚訴訟原告簽名

00:38:58,890 --> 00:38:59,940
你覺得怎么樣
What do you think?

347
00:39:00,430 --> 00:39:01,500
挺不錯的吧
Pretty great, right?

348
00:39:02,010 --> 00:39:03,060
對  都很...
Yeah, it's, um...

349
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:05,070
嗯
Yep.

350
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:08,690
需要你的印刷體姓名和簽名
I just need your printed name and signature.

佛羅里達
So, Florida.

352
00:39:15,170 --> 00:39:17,070
佛羅里達  佛羅里達  佛羅里達
Florida, Florida, Florida...

353
00:39:18,210 --> 00:39:19,290
為什么選那
Why there?

354
00:39:21,730 --> 00:39:23,330
-我想是...  -無所謂
- I guess-- - It doesn't matter.

355
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:25,290
不一定要有原因
Doesn't have to make sense.

356
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:29,480
我得告訴你  我覺得你會后悔的
Hey, I gotta tell you, I think you're gonna regret

357
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:31,710
沒收下你磯鷂渡的那份錢
not taking your share of the Sandpiper money.

358
00:39:32,530 --> 00:39:34,640
那筆錢夠買一大片沼澤地了
That'd buy a shitload of swampland.

359
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:47,000
我...
I will, um,

360
00:39:48,530 --> 00:39:49,880
明天會去提交申請
file these tomorrow.

361
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:51,690
好的
All right. Well.

362
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,470
祝你生活美滿  金
Have a nice life, Kim.

363
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:31,890
美女  下一位是誰
Hey, Sweetcheeks, who do we got next?

364
00:40:31,890 --> 00:40:33,250
開始掙錢了
Let's make some money!

埃米利奧·小山
Emilio Koyama!

366
00:40:41,010 --> 00:40:42,150

Where's your paperwork?

367
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,370
我從來不碰文件
I don't do no paperwork.

368
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:47,120
他不碰文件
He doesn't do paperwork!

369
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:48,870
誰在乎呢  來吧  來吧
Who cares? Come on, come on.

370
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:47,650
可以借根煙抽嗎
Hey, yo, could I bum one of those?

371
00:41:57,110 --> 00:41:58,080
謝謝
Thanks.

372
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:12,740
這是什么鬼天氣
What's up with this shit?

373
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:16,080
下雨了
Rainy.

374
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:20,270
知道  不過這雨也太夸張了
Yeah. No. It-- It's crazy.

375
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:22,970
真令人抓狂
It's like bananas, all this rain.

376
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:27,010
我們不是在沙漠地區嗎
I mean, I thought we were, like, in a desert, you know?

377
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:38,100
你是律師  對嗎
You're a lawyer, right?

378
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:42,480
我認得你
I recognize you.

379
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,720
你為我兄弟康寶辯護過
You defended my buddy Combo.

380
00:42:48,530 --> 00:42:49,980
克里斯蒂安·奧特加
Christian Ortega.

381
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:52,600
少年法庭  偷了個嬰兒耶穌
Juvie court, stole a Baby Jesus.

382
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:54,560
不是真的嬰兒  只是個...
I mean, not like a real baby, just a--

383
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:58,170
就是放在教堂外面的東西
You know, one of those things outside of the church.

384
00:42:58,380 --> 00:42:59,810
-耶誕布景  -對
- Nativity scene. - Yeah.

385
00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:00,890
哥倫布騎士團
Knights of Columbus.

386
00:43:01,970 --> 00:43:05,740
我就納了悶了  他要那玩意干什么
I mean, what the hell did he even want that thing for?

387
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:07,120
我到現在都沒想明白
I mean, I-- I still don't know.

388
00:43:07,130 --> 00:43:08,230
傻逼
Dumbass.

389
00:43:09,330 --> 00:43:10,910
我告訴過他  偷那種東西
I told him he could go to Hell

390
00:43:10,910 --> 00:43:12,410
會下地獄的
for stealing something like that, I mean.

391
00:43:12,410 --> 00:43:14,320
可他聽我的了嗎  沒有
But did he listen to me? No.

392
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:20,450
但是你  你幫他脫了罪  不用受罰  那真是...
But you, you got him off, like, scot-free. That--

393
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:22,950
那真是太屌了
That was pretty slick, yo.

394
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:26,610
告訴他  我希望他不要惹麻煩
Well, tell him I hope he's keeping his nose clean.

395
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:27,970
對  對  你說得對
Yeah, yeah, right on.

必須的
Absolutely.

397
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:36,350
你瞧你這么專業
Hey, so, you having all this expertise and all...

398
00:43:37,310 --> 00:43:39,790
這個古德曼
This guy Goodman?

399
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:41,720
他有真本事嗎
He the real deal?

400
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:43,270
是正經律師嗎
Like, lawyer-wise?

401
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:44,780
為什么這么問
Why do you ask?

402
00:43:49,410 --> 00:43:52,240
我里面有個兄弟  犯了很嚴重的事
I got a buddy in there who's facing some serious time.

403
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:54,750
不是偷嬰兒耶穌那種小事
I mean, not-- you know, not Baby Jesus-time,

404
00:43:54,750 --> 00:43:56,830
是很嚴重的
but... but serious.

405
00:43:56,990 --> 00:43:59,940
他需要一流的代理律師
You know, he needs top-shelf legal representation.

406
00:44:00,190 --> 00:44:01,380
我是這么告訴他的
And I tell him that, right?

407
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:04,350
但是他看到了這家伙的電視廣告
But, you know, he sees this dude's commercials on TV

408
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:06,140
就想來找他
and this is where he wants to go.

409
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:10,890
我跟他說  "埃米利奧  搞笑電視廣告
And I tell him, "Yo, Emilio, you know, a funny TV commercial

410
00:44:10,890 --> 00:44:14,370
并不是可靠的根據"
is not a sound basis for, like, you know..."

411
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:17,750
你會僅憑一支搞笑電視廣告
I mean, like, would you go to doctor to do, like,

412
00:44:17,750 --> 00:44:19,940
就去找那個醫生
an operation on you in like a--

413
00:44:20,230 --> 00:44:22,440
給你的脾之類的
on, like, your spleen or whatever

414
00:44:23,430 --> 00:44:25,700
動手術嗎
on the fact of a funny TV commercial?

415
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:27,130
不會  別鬧了
No. I mean, come on.

416
00:44:27,390 --> 00:44:29,050
這有什么區別
How is this any different?

417
00:44:29,570 --> 00:44:30,490
你說呢
You know?

418
00:44:34,930 --> 00:44:35,930
話說回來
Anyway...

419
00:44:38,390 --> 00:44:40,850
這人靠譜嗎
Is this guy any good?

420
00:44:49,910 --> 00:44:51,530
我認識他的時候  他是靠譜的
When I knew him, he was.

421
00:47:11,910 --> 00:47:12,950
喂
Hello?

422
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:14,940
你好  爸
Hey, uh, Dad?

423
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:17,680
是我  我是杰夫
It's me. It's-- It's Jeff.

424
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:20,080
杰夫  現在幾點了
Jeff? What time is it?

425
00:47:20,210 --> 00:47:21,510
你沒事吧
Are you okay?

426
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:24,080
我不太好
Yeah, no, not really.

427
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:26,070
那個  我...
Um, I, uh...

428
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,270
爸  我被捕了
Dad, I got arrested.

429
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:29,330
不
Oh, no.

430
00:47:29,330 --> 00:47:31,370
為什么  小杰
What for? Jeffie.

431
00:47:31,370 --> 00:47:33,310
這是個天大的誤會
It's like this crazy mistake, you know?

432
00:47:33,310 --> 00:47:35,090
我出了車禍
I mean, I had an accident, okay?

433
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:38,450
就是點小擦撞  不嚴重
A, a little fender-bender type deal, no, no big thing.

434
00:47:38,450 --> 00:47:40,810
我的腳可能不小心踩到了油門上
My foot maybe slipped on the accelerator,

435
00:47:40,810 --> 00:47:43,960
也可能是車子出了什么故障  我不知道
or maybe it was a defective-- I dunno.

436
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:46,510
但這不是重點
But that's not the big-deal part.

437
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:48,680
重點是
The big-deal part is,

438
00:47:49,020 --> 00:47:54,400
他們認為我  我本人  犯了搶劫罪
they think that I, me, committed a robbery.

439
00:47:54,490 --> 00:47:56,110
他們怎么會這么想
And why would they think that?

440
00:47:56,230 --> 00:47:57,590
就是說啊
I know, right?

441
00:47:57,920 --> 00:47:59,290
我出車禍的那個地方
The place where I had the accident?

442
00:47:59,290 --> 00:48:01,110
有個男的  是醉漢
This guy? This drunk guy?

443
00:48:01,110 --> 00:48:02,760
他從自己家里晃晃悠悠地走出來
He comes wandering out of his house

444
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:05,580
攔住了死條子  是警察  說什么
and flags down the cops, the, the police, and says,

445
00:48:05,580 --> 00:48:07,640
"我被打劫了"
"Hey, you know, I got robbed!"

446
00:48:07,950 --> 00:48:09,980
當然了  警察呢
And sure enough, the police?

447
00:48:10,070 --> 00:48:14,660
找到了破門闖入的證據
They find evidence of, like, breaking and entering.

448
00:48:14,660 --> 00:48:18,360
家里也有東西不見了  但這都不是我干的
And, and, and stuff is missing, which I did not do.

449
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:23,150
沒錯  就這樣
And, uh... yeah. Like that.

450
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:26,570
這么說警察肯定是找錯人了
Well, the police are obviously barking up the wrong tree.

451
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:28,130
可不是嗎  找錯人了
Yeah. No shit, wrong tree!

452
00:48:28,130 --> 00:48:31,060
-大錯特錯  -就是
- Wrong, like, forest. - Exactly.

453
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:33,290
因為你絕不會做出這種事
Because you would never do something like that,

454
00:48:33,290 --> 00:48:34,440
對不對  兒子
would you, son?

455
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:37,060
當然不會  絕對不會
No. No. No way, man. Absolutely not.

456
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:39,240
那警察逮捕你的時候
Uh, when the police took you into custody,

457
00:48:39,380 --> 00:48:42,240
他們有發現任何所謂的被盜物品嗎
did they find any of this so-called stolen merchandise?

458
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:43,820
有在你身上發現嗎
Was it in your possession?

459
00:48:43,860 --> 00:48:45,760
-沒有  -當然沒有
- No. - Of course it wasn't.

460
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:47,710
因為你根本就沒有偷東西
Because you didn't steal anything.

461
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:50,330
因此  既然沒有
Therefore, since there's no evidence whatsoever

462
00:48:50,330 --> 00:48:51,640
你犯下了任何罪的相關證據
that you committed any crime,

463
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:53,900
你就沒什么好擔心的了
I'd say you got nothing to worry about.

464
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:55,940
那之后怎么辦
So, what happens next?

465
00:48:56,260 --> 00:48:58,210
深呼吸  安心坐等
Breathe deep and sit tight.

466
00:48:58,210 --> 00:48:59,880
我午飯前就接你出去
I'll have you out by lunchtime.

467
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:01,540
你自己過來嗎
You coming down here yourself?

468
00:49:02,270 --> 00:49:04,660
還是叫你媽去吧
Nah, I think it'll be your mom.

469
00:49:05,890 --> 00:49:07,140
你會替我通知她嗎
You'll talk to her for me?

470
00:49:07,140 --> 00:49:08,240
當然了
I sure will.

471
00:49:08,340 --> 00:49:10,900
我全都會搞定  沒問題的
I'll straighten it all out, no problem.

472
00:49:11,570 --> 00:49:12,690
那好的
Yeah, okay. Good.

473
00:49:13,210 --> 00:49:14,240
杰夫  你會得到
Jeff, you're gonna get

474
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:16,790
全世界最厲害的法律辯護
the best legal defense in the whole wide world.

475
00:49:16,790 --> 00:49:18,770
就相信你老爹吧
Trust your old man on that.

476
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:21,180
好的  收到  安心坐等
Okay, copy that. Sit tight.

477
00:49:21,180 --> 00:49:22,420
沒錯
You do that.

478
00:49:38,580 --> 00:49:40,010
別著急
Keep your shirt on.

479
00:49:41,170 --> 00:49:42,210
喂
Hello?

480
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:45,550
吉恩
Gene.

481
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:48,090
吉恩  親愛的  你知道這才幾點嗎
Gene, Honey, do you know what time it is?

482
00:49:56,780 --> 00:49:57,990
天吶  那個不孝子
Oh. Oh, God. That boy.

483
00:49:58,260 --> 00:50:00,170
我早晚會被他氣死的
He's gonna put me in my grave.

484
00:50:00,170 --> 00:50:01,130
瑪麗恩
Marion.

485
00:50:01,860 --> 00:50:03,280
就是鬧了個誤會
It's a mistake, is all.

486
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:04,820
因為自己沒做過的事而進局子
Getting picked up for something you didn't do?

487
00:50:04,830 --> 00:50:06,560
誰都可能會碰到
That could happen to anybody.

488
00:50:06,570 --> 00:50:08,000
才怪
Yeah, right, anyone.

489
00:50:08,190 --> 00:50:10,000
這不是他第一次了
This isn't the first time, you know.

490
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,620
他之前也惹過麻煩
He's been in trouble before.

491
00:50:11,620 --> 00:50:12,660
老天啊
Oh, Jesus.

492
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:14,210
-瑪麗恩  -這個克星
- Marion... - The death of me.

493
00:50:14,210 --> 00:50:15,850
我會被他活活氣死
He's gonna be the death of me.

494
00:50:15,850 --> 00:50:18,860
瑪麗恩  瑪麗恩  沒事的
Marion. Marion, it's gonna be all right.

495
00:50:18,910 --> 00:50:21,070
我們立馬就能接他出來
We'll get him outta there lickety-split.

496
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:23,430
我經歷過這種情況
I've been through this before.

497
00:50:23,430 --> 00:50:26,110
可費時間了
There's nothing lickety-split about it.

498
00:50:26,250 --> 00:50:28,630
他還住在阿爾布開克的時候
Back when he was living in Albuquerque?

499
00:50:29,090 --> 00:50:31,960
公共場所醉酒  拒捕
Drunk in public, resisting arrest,

500
00:50:32,170 --> 00:50:36,100
在不應該的地方小便
urinating in someplace he shouldn't have.

501
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:40,070
而我打了好幾個小時的長途電話
And me on the telephone for hours, long distance,

502
00:50:40,070 --> 00:50:42,920
就為了給他找保釋公司
trying to find him one of those bail-out places.

503
00:50:42,930 --> 00:50:45,290
我信用卡都刷爆了
I maxed out my Discover card.

504
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:47,000
到現在都在還款
I'm still paying for that one.

505
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,490
錢不成問題
Well, money's not gonna be a problem,

506
00:50:48,490 --> 00:50:49,860
因為我會幫你
'cause I'm gonna help you with that.

507
00:50:50,740 --> 00:50:52,910
不行  吉恩  我怎么好意思
No. Gene, I can't let you do that. No.

508
00:50:52,930 --> 00:50:55,830
當然好意思  杰夫以后可以還我
Sure you can. Jeff'll pay me back.

509
00:50:55,830 --> 00:50:57,770
你也不用擔心擔保人的事
And you don't have to worry about a bondsman, either.

510
00:50:57,770 --> 00:50:59,030
因為知道嗎
Because guess what?

511
00:50:59,130 --> 00:51:01,190
奧馬哈根本就沒這一套
In Omaha, they don't have 'em.

512
00:51:01,530 --> 00:51:03,050
你直接去警察局
All right? You just walk into the station

513
00:51:03,050 --> 00:51:04,400
用現金支付保釋金就行了
and you pay a straight cash bail.

514
00:51:04,410 --> 00:51:06,440
跟阿爾布開克完全不一樣
It's not like Albuquerque at all.

515
00:51:11,740 --> 00:51:13,140
瑪麗恩  你還在聽嗎
Marion, you still there?

516
00:51:13,770 --> 00:51:14,870
嗯  為什么...
Yeah. Why--

517
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:19,230
為什么杰夫聯系的是你  而不是我
Why did Jeff call you instead of me?

518
00:51:19,330 --> 00:51:21,720
他可能怕你一下接受不過來吧
Well, I think he was scared at how you'd take it.

519
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:24,540
說真的  我都打算直接付保釋金了
Honestly, I was gonna pay the bail myself,

520
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:26,260
但后來想想  還是應該由親屬來辦
but I think it should be a family member.

521
00:51:26,260 --> 00:51:27,560
這樣最好
I think that'd be best.

522
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:30,940
這樣吧  我去洗個澡  換好衣服
I'll tell you what, I'm gonna take a shower, get dressed.

523
00:51:30,940 --> 00:51:32,230
你也這么做
And you do the same.

524
00:51:32,250 --> 00:51:33,670
我待會過去接你
I'll swing by and pick you up.

525
00:51:33,670 --> 00:51:35,700
然后我們去把事情解決
We'll get this whole thing squared away.

526
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:39,530
巴迪呢  他有麻煩嗎
Wh-what about Buddy? Is he in any trouble?

527
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:42,170
沒有吧
I don't think so.

528
00:51:42,290 --> 00:51:43,530
他為什么會有麻煩
Why would he be?

529
00:51:46,170 --> 00:51:47,730
我們大概一小時后見
I'll see you in about an hour.

530
00:51:48,370 --> 00:51:50,120
好的  好的  謝謝
Yeah, okay. Yeah. Thanks.

531
00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:20,020
*不*
*Oh, no, oh*

532
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:21,790
*大潮...*
*The tide i--*

533
00:52:21,790 --> 00:52:24,910
*傷我至深的*
*That tease and hurt me bad*

534
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:29,900
*是你對待我的方式*
*But it's the way you do the things you do to me*

535
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:32,750
*我不是那種*
*I'm not the kinda girl*

536
00:52:32,750 --> 00:52:36,850
*輕言放棄的女孩*
*Who gives up just like that*

537
00:52:37,340 --> 00:52:39,930
*不*
*Oh, no, oh*

538
00:52:40,140 --> 00:52:42,020
*大潮洶涌*
*The tide is high*

539
00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:44,860
*但我仍在堅持*
*But I'm holding on*

540
00:52:45,220 --> 00:52:48,560
*我會成為你的第...*
*I'm gonna be your num--*

541
00:52:56,610 --> 00:53:00,600
*我不是那種輕言放棄的女孩*
*I'm not the kinda girl who gives up*

542
00:53:00,730 --> 00:53:01,750
瑪麗恩
Marion!

543
00:53:03,410 --> 00:53:05,550
*輕言放棄的女孩*
*Just like that*

544
00:53:06,210 --> 00:53:07,480
*不*
*Oh, no*

545
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:27,150
瑪麗恩
Marion!

546
00:53:31,590 --> 00:53:32,570
瑪麗恩
Marion?

547
00:53:44,060 --> 00:53:45,080
瑪麗恩
Marion?

548
00:53:49,570 --> 00:53:50,820
你還好吧
Everything okay?

549
00:53:50,820 --> 00:53:51,810
很好  抱歉
Oh, yeah. I'm sorry.

550
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:54,840
我只是忘了時間
I-- I just lost track of the time.

551
00:53:55,580 --> 00:53:56,700
沒關系
That's okay.

552
00:53:57,900 --> 00:53:59,090
你要不要去換件衣服
Uh, you wanna put some clothes on

553
00:53:59,090 --> 00:54:00,340
我們好出發
so that we can get moving?

554
00:54:00,340 --> 00:54:01,570
怎么樣
What do you say?

555
00:54:03,580 --> 00:54:05,160
那個  我...
Uh, you know, well, I, I...

556
00:54:05,300 --> 00:54:06,650
我不想耽誤事
I don't wanna slow things down.

557
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:08,790
要不還是你自己去吧
I think maybe you oughta go without me.

558
00:54:08,860 --> 00:54:11,360
...派對狂歡  想著自己的事
...partying, minding my own business.

559
00:54:12,510 --> 00:54:14,220
你被捕了
You are under arrest.

560
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:15,960
我最好打給索爾
I better call Saul!

561
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:18,420
我是索爾·古德曼
Hi. I'm Saul Goodman.

562
00:54:18,420 --> 00:54:20,080
你知道你有權利嗎
Did you know that you have rights?

563
00:54:20,330 --> 00:54:23,210
憲法說你有  我也說你有
The Constitution says you do, and so do I.

564
00:54:23,210 --> 00:54:25,320
我相信  在被證明有罪之前
I believe that, until proven guilty,

565
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:28,640
這個國家所有的男人  女人  小孩都是無辜的
every man, woman, and child in this country is innocent.

566
00:54:28,670 --> 00:54:30,760
所以我會為你而戰  阿爾布開克
And that's why I fight for you, Albuquerque!

567
00:54:32,750 --> 00:54:33,840
這是什么
What's that?

568
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:36,650
你說呢
You tell me.

569
00:54:40,730 --> 00:54:42,550
瑪麗恩  你覺得這是我嗎
Marion, do you think that's me?

570
00:54:44,220 --> 00:54:45,340
這不是我
'Cause it's not.

571
00:54:47,530 --> 00:54:49,610
從來就沒有咬咬  對嗎
There never was a Nippy, was there?

572
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:54,200
杰夫跟你說什么了
What did Jeff tell you?

573
00:54:54,340 --> 00:54:55,890
他什么也沒說
Oh, he didn't tell me anything.

574
00:54:56,890 --> 00:54:58,850
是搜索引擎告訴我的
Ask Jeeves told me.

575
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:03,820
我輸入了"騙子"和"阿爾布開克"
I typed in "Con man" and "Albuquerque,"

576
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:08,500
你的大名就跳出來了  明晃晃的
and up you popped, big as day.

577
00:55:16,060 --> 00:55:17,100
你干什么  瑪麗恩
What are you doing, Marion?

578
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:19,670
你說呢  我要報警
What do you think I'm doing? I'm calling the police.

579
00:55:20,220 --> 00:55:22,130
來  我來幫你
Here, lemme help you with that.

580
00:55:23,590 --> 00:55:24,790
聽著  我想我們應該
Listen, I think we're losing sight

581
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:26,440
著眼于大局  對不對
of the bigger picture here, okay?

582
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:28,780
杰夫現在有麻煩  而我想幫他
Jeff is in trouble, and I wanna help him.

583
00:55:28,780 --> 00:55:30,710
我和他都需要你的支持
He and I sure could use your support here.

584
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:32,420
你把我兒子卷進什么事里了
What did you get my son into?

585
00:55:32,420 --> 00:55:35,030
都是他自愿做的一些事
Nothing that he didn't ask for.

586
00:55:35,690 --> 00:55:37,450
聽著
Now, listen,

587
00:55:37,660 --> 00:55:40,500
我還是你認識的那個好朋友
I'm still the good friend you thought I was, okay?

588
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:43,940
杰夫理解我  巴迪理解我
Jeff understands me, Buddy understands me.

589
00:55:44,060 --> 00:55:45,330
你也會理解我的
And you will, too.

590
00:55:45,970 --> 00:55:48,010
只是  你得
It's just, you have to, uh,

591
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:52,000
不要節外生枝  好嗎
you know, keep things on an even keel, all right?

592
00:55:53,670 --> 00:55:55,090
你手里拿的什么
What have you got there?

593
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:57,570
把它放下
Put that down.

594
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:01,240
放下  瑪麗恩
Put that down, Marion.

595
00:56:02,660 --> 00:56:03,870
放下
Put it down.

596
00:56:05,710 --> 00:56:07,530
別這么做  瑪麗恩
Do not do it, Marion.

597
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:10,570
最后一次警告
Final warning.

598
00:56:22,150 --> 00:56:23,640
我信任過你
I trusted you.

599
00:56:42,430 --> 00:56:44,500
瑪麗恩  我是生命警報的瓦萊麗
Marion? This is Valerie with Life Alert.

600
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:45,490
你還好嗎
Are you okay?

601
00:56:45,490 --> 00:56:47,670
不  瓦萊麗  我不好
No, Valerie, I'm not okay.

602
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:50,330
有個罪犯正站在我的廚房里  威脅我
There's a criminal standing in my kitchen, threatening me!

603
00:56:50,330 --> 00:56:51,730
他是一個通緝犯
He's a wanted man,

604
00:56:51,890 --> 00:56:54,050
名叫索爾·古德曼
and his name is Saul Goodman!

605
00:56:54,390 --> 00:56:56,300
好的  瑪麗恩  我來報警
All right, Marion, I'm calling the police.

606
