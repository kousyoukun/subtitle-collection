1
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,469
Slow down.

2
00:01:08,602 --> 00:01:10,671
You're gonna
make yourself sick.

3
00:01:36,664 --> 00:01:38,666
You know...

4
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,901
we're sitting on
seven million bucks here.

5
00:01:41,034 --> 00:01:41,935
Literally.

6
00:01:43,371 --> 00:01:44,238
And?

7
00:01:48,209 --> 00:01:50,077
I say we take it,

8
00:01:50,211 --> 00:01:51,545
split it fifty-fifty,

9
00:01:53,347 --> 00:01:54,415
take off.

10
00:01:55,349 --> 00:01:56,550
It's not ours.

11
00:01:59,052 --> 00:01:59,920
Could be.

12
00:02:02,089 --> 00:02:03,524
Yeah, well, I know some people

13
00:02:03,657 --> 00:02:04,992
who would have
a problem with that.

14
00:02:05,926 --> 00:02:06,794
Them?

15
00:02:09,197 --> 00:02:10,164
Don't worry about them.

16
00:02:15,836 --> 00:02:16,737
You feeling right?

17
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:24,912
First thing we do,

18
00:02:25,045 --> 00:02:27,581
take six million bucks
and build a time machine.

19
00:02:29,049 --> 00:02:30,584
Those people that
you're worried about?

20
00:02:31,885 --> 00:02:33,086
They'll never find us.

21
00:02:36,857 --> 00:02:39,327
Where would you go first, huh?

22
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:42,596
- You-- You look like a history buff, right?
- Hm.

23
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:45,098
What, would you go
to Civil War times or...

24
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,302
Um, Ancient Rome?

25
00:02:48,436 --> 00:02:49,937
Oh, Christ.

26
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:54,475
Mm. Hmm.

27
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:00,981
December 8, 2001.

28
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:03,984
Why?

29
00:03:05,286 --> 00:03:06,620
No. No.

30
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:13,126
March 17, 1984.

31
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,634
Day I took my first bribe.

32
00:03:28,309 --> 00:03:29,477
And then I'd go forward.

33
00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:34,648
There's some people I'd like to
check on in five or ten years,

34
00:03:35,749 --> 00:03:37,117
make sure they're doing okay.

35
00:03:43,457 --> 00:03:44,425
You?

36
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,295
It's easy.

37
00:03:49,297 --> 00:03:51,665
May 10, 1965.

38
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:58,038
That's the day Warren Buffett

39
00:03:58,171 --> 00:03:59,673
took over
at Berkshire Hathaway.

40
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:05,212
I figure, got a million left
from building the time machine,

41
00:04:05,346 --> 00:04:07,548
so I'd take my half

42
00:04:07,681 --> 00:04:09,182
and just stick it
into Berkshire.

43
00:04:10,784 --> 00:04:13,253
Then I'd come back here and...

44
00:04:14,622 --> 00:04:16,690
I'm a billionaire.

45
00:04:19,893 --> 00:04:20,694
Ohh.

46
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:24,698
Is there such a thing
as a trillionaire?

47
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,702
That's it. Money?

48
00:04:31,171 --> 00:04:31,739
What else?

49
00:04:32,806 --> 00:04:34,475
Nothing you'd change?

50
00:04:44,818 --> 00:04:45,719
I'm rested.

51
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:23,391
-

52
00:05:26,627 --> 00:05:27,928
Marion?
Are you still there?

53
00:05:28,061 --> 00:05:30,498
Yes! It's a--
It's a little car.

54
00:05:30,631 --> 00:05:32,833
Beige. I-- I--
I don't know the make.

55
00:05:37,438 --> 00:05:38,772
Sixty-four, P...

56
00:05:42,476 --> 00:05:44,077
...F, T, six.

57
00:05:44,211 --> 00:05:46,346
He's headed south,
towards Curtis.

58
00:05:48,115 --> 00:05:49,783
Oh, please get him.

59
00:05:57,825 --> 00:05:59,159
12-14 responding.

60
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:02,696
On that 10-29, V as in Victor.

61
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:04,331
That's a Saturn Aura?

62
00:06:04,465 --> 00:06:05,833
That is correct.

63
00:06:05,966 --> 00:06:09,837
Saturn Aura, Nebraska
six-four-Paul-Frank-Tom-six.

64
00:06:14,842 --> 00:06:17,978
White male, late 40s,
about 5'11", 180 pounds.

65
00:09:02,643 --> 00:09:07,480
"Hoover Max Extract
Pressure-Pro, model sixty."

66
00:09:07,615 --> 00:09:12,620
Hoover Pressure-Pro
Max Extract, model sixty.

67
00:09:34,675 --> 00:09:36,209
-
- Ohh!

68
00:10:00,367 --> 00:10:01,234
Anybody home?

69
00:10:07,675 --> 00:10:08,942
Hands. Now.

70
00:10:29,229 --> 00:10:30,463
I was at a party,

71
00:10:30,597 --> 00:10:31,799
just minding my own business.

72
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:35,903
You are under arrest.

73
00:10:36,036 --> 00:10:37,270
I better call Saul!

74
00:10:38,739 --> 00:10:40,073
Hi. I'm Saul Goodman.

75
00:10:40,207 --> 00:10:42,009
Did you know
that you have rights?

76
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:44,644
The Constitution says you do,
and so do I.

77
00:10:44,778 --> 00:10:46,646
I believe that,
until proven guilty,

78
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:49,649
every man, woman, and child
in this country is innocent.

79
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:52,552
And that's why I fight for you,
Albuquerque! Better Call--

80
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:13,941
Hello, Krista? It's Gene.

81
00:11:16,043 --> 00:11:18,445
Uh, uh, sorry
I wasn't in this morning.

82
00:11:18,578 --> 00:11:19,612
Did you open up okay?

83
00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:24,117
I'm fine.
C-Could you do me a favor?

84
00:11:26,887 --> 00:11:29,456
The week's rotation
needs to be posted by 3:00.

85
00:11:29,589 --> 00:11:30,357
Could you handle that?

86
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,127
Uh, one more thing. Um...

87
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:37,130
Just call the main office.

88
00:11:37,264 --> 00:11:39,266
The-- The number
is on the bulletin board.

89
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:41,534
And, uh, let them know, um...

90
00:11:44,805 --> 00:11:46,406
you're gonna need
a new manager.

91
00:11:51,178 --> 00:11:52,980
This is how they get you?

92
00:11:54,314 --> 00:11:56,616
This is how
they get you?

93
00:11:58,251 --> 00:11:59,987
This is how
they get you?

94
00:12:01,889 --> 00:12:04,157
This is how they get you?

95
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:07,060
This is how
they get you?

96
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,561
Jesus.

97
00:12:09,863 --> 00:12:11,164
What were you thinking?

98
00:12:13,633 --> 00:12:17,570
What... were...
you... thinking?

99
00:12:20,841 --> 00:12:22,042
Ow!

100
00:12:26,847 --> 00:12:27,680
Shit!

101
00:13:06,753 --> 00:13:08,488
Ah! Ah! Hey!

102
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:10,490
-
- Ahh!

103
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:13,226
I need another phone call!

104
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,063
-
- Another phone call!

105
00:13:30,577 --> 00:13:32,145
William Oakley and Associates,

106
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:34,447
"Trust experience,
trust Oakley."

107
00:13:34,581 --> 00:13:36,083
Bill Oakley speaking.

108
00:13:36,216 --> 00:13:38,051
"Trust experience,
trust Oakley."

109
00:13:38,185 --> 00:13:39,953
I like that. It's catchy.

110
00:13:40,087 --> 00:13:41,688
You know who this is, right?

111
00:13:45,792 --> 00:13:46,759
Saul?

112
00:13:46,894 --> 00:13:48,996
You got it, buddy.

113
00:13:49,129 --> 00:13:51,298
Wh-Wh-Wh-What are you, uh--
What-- What are y--

114
00:13:51,431 --> 00:13:53,400
Uh, wha--
Uh, what are you doing?

115
00:13:53,533 --> 00:13:55,602
Uh, you know I'm gonna
have to report this call.

116
00:13:55,735 --> 00:13:57,437
Whoa. Calm down, Junior.

117
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:59,139
The cops know
all about the call.

118
00:13:59,272 --> 00:14:00,440
They're probably listening in.

119
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:02,242
The fact is,
I'm standing in the middle

120
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:04,177
of a police station
as we speak.

121
00:14:06,146 --> 00:14:07,814
So they finally caught you.

122
00:14:07,948 --> 00:14:09,616
Listen. This is your lucky day.

123
00:14:09,749 --> 00:14:13,954
I am talking to Saul Goodman's
new advisory counsel.

124
00:14:14,087 --> 00:14:15,122
What?

125
00:14:15,255 --> 00:14:17,925
Keep up, Bill.
You hit the jackpot.

126
00:14:18,058 --> 00:14:19,192
"Advisory counsel?"

127
00:14:19,326 --> 00:14:21,061
This puts you
on the map, amigo.

128
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:22,629
Here's what you're gonna do.

129
00:14:22,762 --> 00:14:25,465
You're gonna grab a flight
to Omaha, Nebraska, ASAP.

130
00:14:25,598 --> 00:14:26,799
There's nothing direct,

131
00:14:26,934 --> 00:14:28,568
so you're gonna have to
connect through Houston.

132
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:30,670
Wh-- Who's paying for this?

133
00:14:30,803 --> 00:14:33,306
- You are. Listen. You hear that?
- Hear what?

134
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,209
Bang, bang!
That's opportunity knocking.

135
00:14:36,343 --> 00:14:38,311
Get off your ass
and answer the door.

136
00:14:38,445 --> 00:14:39,980
Okay, on your way
to the airport...

137
00:14:40,113 --> 00:14:41,214
- Wait. Wait. Hold on.
- ...I need you to make some calls.

138
00:14:41,348 --> 00:14:43,183
Even supposing, hypothetically,

139
00:14:43,316 --> 00:14:44,851
I'd be willing
to take this on--

140
00:14:44,985 --> 00:14:46,886
"Willing"?
Bill, this is a career-maker.

141
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:48,455
Get real. You're doing this.

142
00:14:48,588 --> 00:14:51,658
The DA has a warehouse
of evidence against you--

143
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:54,361
I can't even begin to imagine
what the Feds are sitting on.

144
00:14:54,494 --> 00:14:58,198
No matter who your lawyer is,
you are screwed.

145
00:14:58,331 --> 00:14:59,832
So I've gotta ask...

146
00:14:59,967 --> 00:15:01,201
Where do you see this ending?

147
00:15:04,437 --> 00:15:06,039
Where do I see it ending? Um...

148
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:34,667
RICO.

149
00:15:34,801 --> 00:15:36,069
Not five, not ten,

150
00:15:36,203 --> 00:15:38,771
but twenty-seven
predicate violations.

151
00:15:38,905 --> 00:15:40,307
Federal conspiracy
to manufacture and distribute

152
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,674
a controlled substance.

153
00:15:41,808 --> 00:15:44,311
On this scale?
Life sentence, stat max.

154
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:45,645
Money laundering.

155
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:47,380
Eight counts, 20 years each.

156
00:15:47,514 --> 00:15:50,217
One hundred sixty years,
stat max.

157
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:52,585
We'll argue for
consecutive sentencing.

158
00:15:52,719 --> 00:15:55,155
Accessory
after the fact
to multiple murders.

159
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:58,391
Including two decorated
federal officers.

160
00:15:58,525 --> 00:15:59,459
Fifteen years each.

161
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:02,729
By our count,
that's life plus...

162
00:16:02,862 --> 00:16:04,531
One hundred ninety.

163
00:16:04,664 --> 00:16:06,399
Life plus 190 years.

164
00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:11,738
All right.
I'm willing to extend

165
00:16:11,871 --> 00:16:14,241
a one-time,
take-it-or-leave-it offer.

166
00:16:14,374 --> 00:16:17,810
Here's the headline: 30 years.

167
00:16:17,944 --> 00:16:20,413
Keep your nose clean,
stay healthy,

168
00:16:20,547 --> 00:16:22,415
you have a shot at seeing
daylight in your old age.

169
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:28,821
Mr. Oakley, your "co-counsel,"

170
00:16:29,889 --> 00:16:31,958
is he here with us?

171
00:16:32,092 --> 00:16:34,961
Uh, listen, you've got
Agent Schrader's widow
back there.

172
00:16:35,095 --> 00:16:37,064
- Why don't you invite her in?
- Uh, wait a sec--

173
00:16:37,197 --> 00:16:38,631
I mean, you owe her
that much, don't you?

174
00:16:38,765 --> 00:16:39,999
Well, no, she--
she can't be present at a--

175
00:16:40,133 --> 00:16:42,135
a plea negotiation.
It's completely inappropriate.

176
00:16:42,269 --> 00:16:43,436
She's already here.

177
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:45,004
Both parties agree.
It's fine. Really.

178
00:17:27,214 --> 00:17:29,482
They tell me they found you
in a garbage dumpster.

179
00:17:32,185 --> 00:17:33,486
Well, that makes sense.

180
00:17:37,624 --> 00:17:39,526
My husband was the best man
that I have ever known.

181
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:44,164
He lived to help others.

182
00:17:45,998 --> 00:17:49,302
If somebody was in trouble,
no matter the time,

183
00:17:49,436 --> 00:17:52,505
no matter the place,
Hank Schrader would be there.

184
00:17:56,643 --> 00:17:57,777
With a smile and a joke.

185
00:18:01,514 --> 00:18:03,583
He was kind,

186
00:18:04,951 --> 00:18:05,885
he was decent,

187
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:08,020
he was strong.

188
00:18:11,858 --> 00:18:12,759
His partner...

189
00:18:16,062 --> 00:18:17,029
Steve Gomez.

190
00:18:17,164 --> 00:18:19,732
Steve and Blanca

191
00:18:19,866 --> 00:18:22,935
made a home that was warm
and full of laughter.

192
00:18:24,671 --> 00:18:25,538
Three children.

193
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:31,711
Three fatherless children.

194
00:18:34,214 --> 00:18:36,716
Hank and Steve, the good guys.

195
00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:40,019
They were shot dead

196
00:18:41,588 --> 00:18:43,256
and left in a hole
in the desert.

197
00:18:46,259 --> 00:18:47,126
And you.

198
00:18:48,861 --> 00:18:50,163
You helped

199
00:18:50,297 --> 00:18:52,932
the two-faced
poisonous bastard
behind it all.

200
00:18:56,035 --> 00:18:56,803
For what?

201
00:18:58,171 --> 00:18:59,038
Money.

202
00:19:01,774 --> 00:19:04,577
You did it all for money.

203
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:09,081
No matter
what they do with you now,

204
00:19:09,216 --> 00:19:11,150
no matter where they put you
or for how long,

205
00:19:11,284 --> 00:19:14,287
it will never be enough.

206
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:26,165
Mrs... Mrs. Schrader.

207
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:31,137
The loss
that you've suffered...

208
00:19:31,271 --> 00:19:32,305
It's unspeakable.

209
00:19:37,844 --> 00:19:40,913
I met your husband a few times.

210
00:19:42,815 --> 00:19:45,117
He was a man
who stood by his word

211
00:19:45,252 --> 00:19:46,619
and was very good at his job.

212
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:48,855
A straight shooter.

213
00:19:51,324 --> 00:19:52,492
You and he are...

214
00:19:54,093 --> 00:19:54,694
victims.

215
00:19:59,098 --> 00:19:59,832
And so am I.

216
00:20:05,972 --> 00:20:08,641
Two years ago
a man came into my office.

217
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:12,211
He said his name was Mayhew.

218
00:20:13,946 --> 00:20:17,149
He wanted one of my clients
to lie under oath.

219
00:20:17,284 --> 00:20:18,551
He offered me money.

220
00:20:19,852 --> 00:20:21,187
I declined.

221
00:20:21,321 --> 00:20:22,322
Any lawyer would.

222
00:20:24,324 --> 00:20:28,828
That night, as I was leaving
my office, I was attacked.

223
00:20:30,763 --> 00:20:32,565
Two men
threw a sack over my head,

224
00:20:32,699 --> 00:20:34,233
they hogtied me,

225
00:20:34,367 --> 00:20:36,669
and they drove me
out into the desert.

226
00:20:36,803 --> 00:20:38,505
And when they pulled
the hood off,

227
00:20:38,638 --> 00:20:41,674
I was kneeling
in front of an open grave.

228
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:45,812
With a gun pointed at my head.

229
00:20:45,945 --> 00:20:48,047
That was my introduction
to Walter White.

230
00:20:52,352 --> 00:20:53,553
From that moment on,

231
00:20:55,322 --> 00:20:57,690
there hasn't been a minute
that I wasn't afraid.

232
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:02,395
Yeah. I worked for him.
I made a lot of money.

233
00:21:02,529 --> 00:21:04,631
But that's not why I did it.

234
00:21:04,764 --> 00:21:09,035
I did it because
I knew what he would do
to me if I refused.

235
00:21:09,168 --> 00:21:12,071
Over and over, I thought
about going to the police.

236
00:21:12,204 --> 00:21:14,674
I even thought about
talking to Agent Schrader.

237
00:21:14,807 --> 00:21:19,111
But I knew that Walter White
would kill me, wherever I was.

238
00:21:20,413 --> 00:21:21,714
And I was right.

239
00:21:23,015 --> 00:21:23,716
You look it up.

240
00:21:24,751 --> 00:21:27,854
October 4, 2009.

241
00:21:27,987 --> 00:21:32,525
They murdered ten men
inside three prisons

242
00:21:32,659 --> 00:21:33,893
in the space of two minutes.

243
00:21:34,594 --> 00:21:35,495
Knifed.

244
00:21:36,363 --> 00:21:38,064
Throats slashed.

245
00:21:38,197 --> 00:21:40,767
A man was burned alive.

246
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:44,103
They even killed
one of my colleagues, a lawyer.

247
00:21:44,236 --> 00:21:46,138
He was cooperating
with the DEA.

248
00:21:48,408 --> 00:21:49,442
Daniel Wachsburger.

249
00:21:51,277 --> 00:21:56,516
The news said
Dan was stabbed 48 times.

250
00:21:59,018 --> 00:22:03,055
So, yeah,
when it all blew up, I ran.

251
00:22:03,189 --> 00:22:04,256
But not from the police.

252
00:22:05,392 --> 00:22:05,925
From them.

253
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,762
Walter White might be dead,

254
00:22:09,896 --> 00:22:12,098
but Jesse Pinkman
and the others?

255
00:22:12,231 --> 00:22:14,266
They're still out there, somewhere.

256
00:22:18,237 --> 00:22:18,971
Mrs. Schrader...

257
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:23,876
you are looking at a man
who has lost everything.

258
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:26,779
My profession.
My family. My freedom.

259
00:22:27,814 --> 00:22:29,949
I have-- I have nobody.

260
00:22:30,082 --> 00:22:30,783
I have nothing.

261
00:22:40,927 --> 00:22:42,795
And you think
jurors are gonna buy that?

262
00:22:47,066 --> 00:22:47,967
One.

263
00:22:50,603 --> 00:22:51,804
All I need is one.

264
00:22:56,108 --> 00:22:59,078
Oakley tells me that
you've never lost a case.

265
00:23:01,013 --> 00:23:02,114
Is that so?

266
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:07,053
That's a hell of a record.
You should be proud of that.

267
00:23:07,186 --> 00:23:08,020
Still...

268
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:10,022
Juries, right?

269
00:23:11,524 --> 00:23:13,693
Whew. You never can tell.

270
00:23:13,826 --> 00:23:15,194
It's a roll of the dice.

271
00:23:17,497 --> 00:23:19,699
I'm just-- I'm hoping
there's some wiggle room.

272
00:23:22,802 --> 00:23:25,337
You are not going to
negotiate with this man.

273
00:23:25,472 --> 00:23:26,272
You're not.

274
00:23:57,103 --> 00:23:57,504
Seventeen.

275
00:23:58,738 --> 00:24:01,207
After sentence has been imposed
on the counts

276
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:05,077
to which
defendant pleads guilty
as agreed herein,

277
00:24:05,211 --> 00:24:07,279
the government
will move to dismiss

278
00:24:07,413 --> 00:24:09,882
Counts Three through Nine
of the indictment.

279
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:12,919
Eighteen.

280
00:24:13,052 --> 00:24:15,287
Based on the facts
now known to the government,

281
00:24:15,421 --> 00:24:18,157
the anticipated
offense level is 35,

282
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:20,059
which, when combined

283
00:24:20,192 --> 00:24:23,095
with the anticipated criminal
history category of 1,

284
00:24:23,229 --> 00:24:24,897
results in an anticipated

285
00:24:25,031 --> 00:24:27,233
advisory sentencing
guidelines range

286
00:24:27,366 --> 00:24:30,069
of 85 to 90 months imprisonment,

287
00:24:30,202 --> 00:24:32,605
in addition
to any supervised release,

288
00:24:32,739 --> 00:24:35,708
fine, and restitution
the Court may impose.

289
00:24:38,911 --> 00:24:40,379
Seven and a half years.

290
00:24:42,148 --> 00:24:43,482
Let's get
this thing signed

291
00:24:43,616 --> 00:24:44,751
and get the hell out of here.

292
00:24:44,884 --> 00:24:45,785
We're good with that.

293
00:24:45,918 --> 00:24:48,120
"Nineteen."

294
00:24:48,254 --> 00:24:52,892
"Term to be served at
FCI Butner Low, North Carolina,

295

296
00:24:56,696 --> 00:24:58,831
FCI Butner Low.

297
00:24:58,965 --> 00:25:02,334
It's a great location.
Very nice weather.

298
00:25:02,468 --> 00:25:05,304
It's the only
federal institution
with a golf program.

299
00:25:05,437 --> 00:25:06,773
It was good enough
for Bernie Madoff...

300
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,109
This is an actual request?

301
00:25:10,242 --> 00:25:11,844
Are you kidding?

302
00:25:11,978 --> 00:25:13,279
I give you guys half a chance,

303
00:25:13,412 --> 00:25:15,181
you're gonna throw me into
gen pop in some hellhole.

304
00:25:16,983 --> 00:25:19,351
I visited a client once
at ADX Montrose.

305
00:25:20,486 --> 00:25:22,855
"The Alcatraz of the Rockies."

306
00:25:22,989 --> 00:25:24,957
No. No, that's a dealbreaker,
my friend.

307
00:25:34,667 --> 00:25:36,969
FCI Butner Low. Wing...

308
00:25:37,103 --> 00:25:38,771
D. Wing D.

309
00:25:38,905 --> 00:25:40,372
-
- "Wing D."

310
00:25:41,507 --> 00:25:43,610
And now we are done.

311
00:25:43,743 --> 00:25:47,246
Ah, as Steve Jobs used to say,
one more thing.

312
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:49,081
"Twenty."

313
00:25:49,215 --> 00:25:52,318

316
00:25:57,489 --> 00:25:58,324
Are you kidding?

317
00:25:58,457 --> 00:25:59,926
He's kidding.

318
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:01,560
"Blue Bell

319

No substitutions.

320
00:26:02,795 --> 00:26:04,764
Okay. That's it.

321
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:07,166
Hold on.
I can oil everybody's locks.

322
00:26:07,299 --> 00:26:09,301
- No more games.
- No. I got a sweetener.

323
00:26:09,435 --> 00:26:11,003
It's nothing I've talked about.

324
00:26:11,137 --> 00:26:12,872
New arena. Primo stuff.

325
00:26:18,711 --> 00:26:19,511
Go.

326
00:26:20,647 --> 00:26:21,914
Inside story,

327
00:26:22,048 --> 00:26:24,516
previously unknown
felony homicide.

328
00:26:26,385 --> 00:26:28,821
It concerns a prominent
Albuquerque attorney

329
00:26:28,955 --> 00:26:30,823
who, uh, disappeared,

330
00:26:30,957 --> 00:26:33,459
believed to have
killed himself.

331
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:34,927
Howard Hamlin?

332
00:26:35,061 --> 00:26:36,629
You're talking
about Howard Hamlin.

333
00:26:36,763 --> 00:26:37,730
That's your "sweetener"?

334
00:26:39,966 --> 00:26:41,100
He's trying to sell us
the Hamlin thing.

335
00:26:43,069 --> 00:26:44,536
He thought
he really had something.

336
00:26:45,738 --> 00:26:47,039
Sounds like you and your ex

337
00:26:47,173 --> 00:26:49,642
aren't talking
on a regular basis.

338
00:26:49,776 --> 00:26:53,379
Kim Wexler walked into
the Albuquerque DA's office
last month.

339
00:26:53,512 --> 00:26:57,549
She spilled her guts about
Howard Hamlin, on the record.

340
00:26:57,684 --> 00:26:59,218
You got
nothing left to sell.

341
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,388
Last chance.

342
00:27:02,521 --> 00:27:05,224
Do we go to trial,
or do we have a deal?

343
00:27:07,126 --> 00:27:08,027
Yes!

344
00:27:08,695 --> 00:27:10,730
Yes, we have a deal.

345
00:27:29,916 --> 00:27:31,150
-

346
00:27:47,133 --> 00:27:48,467
Ugh. Of course.

347
00:28:03,249 --> 00:28:05,785
Am I gonna be sorry
if I ask what's going on?

348
00:28:06,753 --> 00:28:08,687
I'm putting a stop to it.

349
00:28:08,821 --> 00:28:10,689
A stop to what?

350
00:28:10,823 --> 00:28:12,324
-
- To what?

351
00:28:14,226 --> 00:28:16,495
Listen. Just-- No. Just listen.

352
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,034
That click?

353
00:28:22,168 --> 00:28:23,002
The click.

354
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:27,039
The flame is lighting

355
00:28:27,173 --> 00:28:29,976
and then it keeps going out.

356
00:28:30,109 --> 00:28:34,646
So it's either
a thermocouple that's corroded

357
00:28:34,781 --> 00:28:35,982
or we have a short.

358
00:28:37,349 --> 00:28:40,486
A thermocouple is corroded.
Okay. I got it.

359
00:28:40,619 --> 00:28:43,055
Hey, uh, maybe we could
just unplug it?

360
00:28:43,189 --> 00:28:45,191
- Or cut a wire or something?
- No. Listen.

361
00:28:45,324 --> 00:28:51,330
I see no reason
to stay down here
without hot water

362
00:28:51,463 --> 00:28:53,099
when it's something
that I can easily fix.

363
00:28:53,232 --> 00:28:54,867
Aha!

364
00:28:55,001 --> 00:28:56,435
I think this will do the trick.

365
00:28:58,504 --> 00:29:00,539
You wouldn't happen to have
a pocket knife or a screwdriver

366
00:29:00,672 --> 00:29:02,041
in one of those bags,
would you?

367
00:29:02,174 --> 00:29:02,975
No.

368
00:29:03,709 --> 00:29:05,177
What? Speak up!

369
00:29:05,812 --> 00:29:06,645
No.

370
00:29:13,652 --> 00:29:15,888
-

371
00:29:18,657 --> 00:29:19,591
Come on!

372
00:29:19,725 --> 00:29:21,193
-
- There we go.

373
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:32,004
Yeah. This should work.

374
00:29:36,075 --> 00:29:37,676
-

375
00:29:49,188 --> 00:29:51,023
Hey, you're a scientist, right?

376
00:29:51,157 --> 00:29:53,125
So, uh, I have a question.

377
00:29:53,259 --> 00:29:54,927
What would you do
if you had a time machine?

378
00:29:56,562 --> 00:29:58,397
A time machine?

379
00:30:00,066 --> 00:30:01,800
Yeah, um...

380
00:30:01,934 --> 00:30:03,602
From a scientist's
point of view.

381
00:30:03,735 --> 00:30:05,437
-
- You can go backwards, forwards.

382
00:30:05,571 --> 00:30:06,805
Uh, where would you go?

383
00:30:06,939 --> 00:30:09,108
A meaningless question.

384
00:30:09,241 --> 00:30:10,442
Time--

385
00:30:10,576 --> 00:30:12,678
A time machine.

386
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:15,347
Look, time travel,

387
00:30:15,481 --> 00:30:17,416
the kind of time travel
that you're thinking of,

388
00:30:17,549 --> 00:30:19,651
is a scientific impossibility.

389
00:30:19,785 --> 00:30:22,554
It would violate the Second Law
of Thermodynamics.

390
00:30:22,688 --> 00:30:25,424
- Uh, but what about a wormhole?
- Ohh!

391
00:30:25,557 --> 00:30:27,960
Well, I was watching NOVA,
and Alan Alda seemed to think--

392
00:30:28,094 --> 00:30:30,963
Oh, well, then Alan Alda,
he's the expert.

393
00:30:31,097 --> 00:30:33,632
Oh, Christ. Are you kidding me?

394
00:30:33,765 --> 00:30:36,268
Quantum mechanics?
We're discussing that now?

395
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:39,471
Stay in your lane.

396
00:30:44,776 --> 00:30:47,113
It's just a thought experiment.

397
00:30:47,246 --> 00:30:48,948
There's gotta be something
you'd go back and change

398
00:30:49,081 --> 00:30:50,082
if you could.

399
00:30:55,554 --> 00:30:59,525
Oh, you are not talking
about a time machine,

400
00:30:59,658 --> 00:31:02,294
which is both a real
and theoretical impossibility.

401
00:31:03,629 --> 00:31:05,431
You are talking about regrets.

402
00:31:05,564 --> 00:31:08,700
So if you want to ask
about regrets,

403
00:31:08,834 --> 00:31:11,703
just ask about regrets

404
00:31:11,837 --> 00:31:15,007
and leave all this
time-traveling nonsense
out of it.

405
00:31:15,141 --> 00:31:16,508
Okay. Regrets, then.

406
00:31:20,812 --> 00:31:21,480
Regrets.

407
00:31:22,614 --> 00:31:23,315
Yeah.

408
00:31:27,253 --> 00:31:28,720
My regrets. All right, well...

409
00:31:33,625 --> 00:31:34,493
My regrets...

410
00:31:51,277 --> 00:31:52,178
Well...

411
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,215
-

412
00:32:00,852 --> 00:32:03,189
When I was a graduate student,

413
00:32:03,322 --> 00:32:05,257
I started a company
with some...

414
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:10,029
At the time, I thought
they were my friends.

415
00:32:11,998 --> 00:32:16,602
Our goal was to
commercialize discoveries
that I had made.

416
00:32:18,904 --> 00:32:21,540
And at a certain point...

417
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:26,512
I stepped away.

418
00:32:26,645 --> 00:32:28,380
I thought I was doing
the gentlemanly thing.

419
00:32:30,249 --> 00:32:31,650
But little did I understand

420
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:34,786
that they were
artfully maneuvering me

421
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,655
into leaving my own creation.

422
00:32:40,592 --> 00:32:42,294
And had I stayed, oh...

423
00:32:45,097 --> 00:32:45,831
Well...

424
00:32:48,034 --> 00:32:49,801
I wouldn't be
down here with you.

425
00:32:51,303 --> 00:32:53,772
So you started a company.
Is it still around?

426
00:32:55,874 --> 00:32:56,775
Oh, yes.

427
00:32:58,244 --> 00:32:59,811
Is it successful?

428
00:33:01,647 --> 00:33:03,115
Very.

429
00:33:03,249 --> 00:33:05,517
How could you never
tell me about this?

430
00:33:05,651 --> 00:33:07,819
We could have
done something with this.

431
00:33:07,953 --> 00:33:10,622
Wrongful termination,
intellectual property theft,

432
00:33:10,756 --> 00:33:12,224
uh, patent fraud.

433
00:33:12,358 --> 00:33:14,126
I mean, I coulda
sunk my teeth into this!

434
00:33:15,694 --> 00:33:18,997
You'd have been the last lawyer
I'd have gone to.

435
00:33:21,267 --> 00:33:22,701
- Yeah. Sure.
-

436
00:33:26,738 --> 00:33:27,739
So, what about you?

437
00:33:29,975 --> 00:33:31,143
- What?
- Regrets?

438
00:33:35,981 --> 00:33:37,015
Y-- Wait. I got one.

439
00:33:42,988 --> 00:33:44,290
You know what? Never mind.

440
00:33:44,423 --> 00:33:45,524
When I was 20--

441
00:33:45,657 --> 00:33:47,559
um, 22,

442
00:33:47,693 --> 00:33:50,028
I pulled a slip and fall
outside Marshall Field's.

443
00:33:50,162 --> 00:33:51,497
- Uh--
- I did.

444
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:54,466
And I was stupid and young
and I was trying to show off.

445
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,402
So I hit the ice
as fast as I could.

446
00:33:56,535 --> 00:33:58,970
I biffed it so hard,
I heard a crack!

447
00:33:59,105 --> 00:34:01,540
Whew.
Wasn't the ice, it was me.

448
00:34:01,673 --> 00:34:05,010
I actually hurt myself.

449
00:34:05,144 --> 00:34:07,646
I mean, I-- My knee
has never been the same.

450
00:34:10,316 --> 00:34:12,118
"A slip and fall"?

451
00:34:12,251 --> 00:34:15,354
Yeah. That's how I put myself
through bartending school.

452
00:34:17,323 --> 00:34:18,757
-
- Right.

453
00:34:23,562 --> 00:34:24,496
So...

454
00:34:30,001 --> 00:34:31,503
So you were always like this.

455
00:35:26,858 --> 00:35:27,626
Sorry.

456
00:35:34,032 --> 00:35:35,334
Psst! Bill! Hey.

457
00:35:36,235 --> 00:35:37,403
I'm just going to--

458
00:35:37,536 --> 00:35:39,104
Sir, this man
is a federal prisoner.

459
00:35:39,238 --> 00:35:40,206
I'm a US Marshal.

460
00:35:41,507 --> 00:35:43,575
I ask you not to speak to him.

461
00:35:43,709 --> 00:35:44,576
That's my lawyer.

462
00:35:47,012 --> 00:35:47,879
Is that true?
You're his lawyer?

463
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,216
Yes.

464
00:35:50,349 --> 00:35:52,150
You'll have other opportunities
to talk to your client.

465
00:35:52,284 --> 00:35:53,084
Please move out of the aisle.

466
00:35:53,219 --> 00:35:54,753
No, hold on.

467
00:35:54,886 --> 00:35:57,456
N-Nothing I say in front of you
is privileged, right?

468
00:35:58,224 --> 00:35:59,491
That's right.

469
00:35:59,625 --> 00:36:01,860
So if I talk to my attorney
and we let something slip

470
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:03,695
that could help
the government's case,

471
00:36:03,829 --> 00:36:05,464
you could pass it along
to the prosecution.

472
00:36:05,597 --> 00:36:06,432
Totally clean.

473
00:36:07,233 --> 00:36:08,099
Correct.

474
00:36:09,768 --> 00:36:12,103
With that in mind, you're sure
we can't have a few words?

475
00:36:19,278 --> 00:36:20,178
Make it fast.

476
00:36:22,281 --> 00:36:25,551
She confessed.
What's the DA gonna do with it?

477
00:36:25,684 --> 00:36:28,620
No witnesses,
no physical evidence.

478
00:36:28,754 --> 00:36:31,357
If I had to guess,
most likely they sit on it.

479
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:32,491
Permanently.

480
00:36:34,426 --> 00:36:35,294
Okay.

481
00:36:36,328 --> 00:36:38,730
No, not "okay."

482
00:36:38,864 --> 00:36:40,699
Not for her.
Her problem's not the DA.

483
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:42,234
What then?

484
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:46,037
Well, apparently, Kim took her
sworn and notarized statement

485
00:36:46,171 --> 00:36:48,139
and hand delivered it
to Hamlin's widow.

486
00:36:48,274 --> 00:36:50,008
- No.
- Yes.

487
00:36:50,141 --> 00:36:52,210
She opened herself up
to a civil suit.

488
00:36:52,344 --> 00:36:54,546
The widow can take her
for everything she has

489
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:57,349
and everything
she's gonna have,
in perpetuity.

490
00:36:57,483 --> 00:36:59,084
So, is she? Suing?

491
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:03,021
Look, all I can tell you
for sure

492
00:37:03,154 --> 00:37:06,325
is that Mrs. Hamlin's out
lawyer shopping as we speak.

493
00:37:07,493 --> 00:37:08,694
Not that she bothered
to call me.

494
00:37:13,098 --> 00:37:15,834
Hey, can I, uh,
go to the john now?

495
00:37:18,337 --> 00:37:19,170
I'm going.

496
00:37:47,699 --> 00:37:48,900
Hold up, Bill.

497
00:37:49,034 --> 00:37:51,269
No, wait.
You're gonna love this.

498
00:37:51,403 --> 00:37:53,204
The Hamlin thing?
The government
doesn't know the half of it.

499
00:37:53,339 --> 00:37:54,773
As soon as we land,

500
00:37:54,906 --> 00:37:56,241
I want you
to tell the other side

501
00:37:56,375 --> 00:37:58,043
that I've got more
to trade, okay?

502
00:37:58,176 --> 00:37:59,611
I j-just remembered something

503
00:37:59,745 --> 00:38:00,712
that'll make their toes curl.

504
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:03,281
Okay.

505
00:38:03,415 --> 00:38:05,417
Anything that makes
their "toes curl"

506
00:38:05,551 --> 00:38:07,419
is bound to jam Kim up.

507
00:38:07,553 --> 00:38:08,820
If it involves her.

508
00:38:08,954 --> 00:38:11,089
Oh, it involves her.

509
00:38:11,222 --> 00:38:13,925
Kim's already got a civil suit
hanging over her head.

510
00:38:14,059 --> 00:38:16,127
You give the government more,

511
00:38:16,261 --> 00:38:17,729
maybe they bring
the hammer down.

512
00:38:20,231 --> 00:38:21,400
What more are you gonna get?

513
00:38:21,533 --> 00:38:22,934
What's left?

514
00:38:23,068 --> 00:38:24,403
You don't understand.

515
00:38:24,536 --> 00:38:26,472
It's really good ice cream.

516
00:38:51,229 --> 00:38:53,098
- Boys again?
- Girls this time.

517
00:38:53,231 --> 00:38:55,401
Well, she's not sleeping
for a year or two.

518
00:38:55,534 --> 00:38:57,403
- At least.
- Is she coming back?

519
00:38:57,536 --> 00:38:58,837
She'll have to.

520
00:38:58,970 --> 00:39:00,105
Josh is a twin, isn't he?

521
00:39:00,238 --> 00:39:02,508
Oh, yeah. And it's
his birthday next week.

522
00:39:02,641 --> 00:39:04,510
I always take him out,
just the two of us,

523
00:39:04,643 --> 00:39:06,311
because, you know,
he had to share everything.

524
00:39:06,445 --> 00:39:07,178
Well, that's nice.

525
00:39:07,312 --> 00:39:08,747
It's either Red Lobster

526
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,282
or that new
Middle Eastern place,
the one over on Wickham.

527
00:39:11,417 --> 00:39:13,118
- Top something?
- Topkapi.

528
00:39:13,251 --> 00:39:15,020
That's it. Topkapi.

529
00:39:15,153 --> 00:39:17,656
Glen took you there, didn't he?
What'd you guys think?

530
00:39:17,789 --> 00:39:20,025
Uh, it wasn't...

531
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:22,360
Not good, huh?

532
00:39:23,495 --> 00:39:25,363
No, uh... No. It was fine.

533
00:39:25,497 --> 00:39:26,465
Would Josh like it?

534
00:39:29,468 --> 00:39:30,969
He-- He might.

535
00:39:31,102 --> 00:39:33,472
Okay. Another birthday
at Red Lobster.

536
00:39:33,605 --> 00:39:35,574
He can live with that.

537
00:39:35,707 --> 00:39:38,343
What did we
get them for the shower?
A stroller, right?

538
00:39:38,477 --> 00:39:40,912
Yeah, one of the nice ones
with the shock absorbers.

539
00:39:41,046 --> 00:39:43,248
With twins? They might need
a double stroller...

540
00:40:07,739 --> 00:40:08,840
You, too, Donny.

541
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:15,346
Seana, Donny from
TPC Sawgrass, line four.

542
00:40:15,481 --> 00:40:18,349
Hey, Tammy. I'm leaving early.
Can you let Ricardo know?

543
00:40:18,484 --> 00:40:19,350
- Sure. No prob.
-

544
00:40:19,485 --> 00:40:20,251
Thanks.

545
00:40:21,487 --> 00:40:22,654
Palm Coast Sprinkler.

546

Watering your world since 1978.

547
00:41:40,799 --> 00:41:43,034
If he shows up,
you keep that door locked.

548
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:45,671
You call the police,
and then you call me.

549
00:41:45,804 --> 00:41:47,272
Any time, day or night.

550
00:41:47,405 --> 00:41:48,306
Okay?

551
00:41:48,439 --> 00:41:49,775
- Okay.
- I'll see you Thursday.

552
00:41:49,908 --> 00:41:51,843
Let me know
if you need me to pick you up.

553
00:41:51,977 --> 00:41:53,178
- All right. Thank you.
- Okay.

554
00:41:59,985 --> 00:42:01,587
Ladies, it's right this way.

555
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:04,122
Sorry about the heat.
AC's on the fritz.

556
00:42:14,032 --> 00:42:16,702
Fill this out.
And, before you ask,
there's no charge.

557
00:42:16,835 --> 00:42:18,469
All our services are free.

558
00:42:18,604 --> 00:42:22,007
Oh, a-actually, I'm here
to see if I can volunteer.

559
00:42:22,841 --> 00:42:24,309
You want to volunteer?

560
00:42:24,442 --> 00:42:25,711
- Yes.
-

561
00:42:25,844 --> 00:42:27,278
Can you answer a phone?

562
00:42:27,412 --> 00:42:28,346
Sure.

563
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:29,981
Then there you go.

564
00:42:37,255 --> 00:42:38,990
Central Florida Legal Aid.
How can I help you?

565
00:43:18,764 --> 00:43:21,299
- Hello?
- Kim?

566
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:24,169
- Yes. - This is Suzanne Ericsen.

567
00:43:24,302 --> 00:43:25,036
Hi, Suzanne.

568
00:43:25,904 --> 00:43:27,072
I want to make it clear

569
00:43:27,205 --> 00:43:28,273
this call
is completely unofficial.

570
00:43:29,307 --> 00:43:30,041
All right.

571
00:43:31,209 --> 00:43:32,878
I shouldn't even
be talking to you.

572
00:43:33,011 --> 00:43:34,212
But considering everything,

573
00:43:34,345 --> 00:43:35,947
I think it's only right
you know what's going on.

574
00:43:36,882 --> 00:43:37,615
You've seen the news?

575
00:43:39,350 --> 00:43:40,618
I don't think so.

576
00:43:40,752 --> 00:43:42,620
Your ex, "Saul Goodman"?

577
00:43:43,889 --> 00:43:45,757
He was arrested in Nebraska.

578
00:43:45,891 --> 00:43:47,258
He's been extradited
to New Mexico.

579
00:43:51,730 --> 00:43:53,064
When was this?

580
00:43:53,198 --> 00:43:54,099
Two days ago.

581
00:43:55,566 --> 00:43:56,902
But that's not why I'm calling.

582
00:43:58,436 --> 00:44:01,639
He's giving testimony
that affects you, personally.

583
00:44:05,376 --> 00:44:06,712
What kind of testimony?

584
00:44:24,362 --> 00:44:30,969

It's showtime.

600
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:56,187
All rise
for the right honorable
Judge Samantha Small.

601
00:46:00,025 --> 00:46:02,760
Court's now in session.
Please take a seat.

602
00:46:07,833 --> 00:46:11,202
Okay, item one on the calendar,

603
00:46:12,403 --> 00:46:16,207
CR 10-7253 United States
of America versus...

604
00:46:18,343 --> 00:46:21,379
Defendant has requested
to use the name Saul Goodman.

605
00:46:21,512 --> 00:46:25,750
So it's "United States
versus Saul Goodman."

606
00:46:25,884 --> 00:46:27,385
Counsel, please state
your appearances.

607
00:46:30,355 --> 00:46:32,858
AUSA George Castellano.

608
00:46:32,991 --> 00:46:35,894
With me is Elizabeth Nooryani,

609
00:46:36,027 --> 00:46:40,198
Trial Attorney from the
Drug Enforcement Section
of the Department of Justice,

610
00:46:40,331 --> 00:46:43,768
AUSAs Sarah Braddock,
Neel Patel, and Hillary Park

611
00:46:43,902 --> 00:46:47,105
and Special Agent in Charge
Austin Ramey from the DEA.

612
00:46:47,238 --> 00:46:48,806
Also present in the courtroom,

613
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:50,808
Zachary Hernandez,
Special Agent in Charge

614
00:46:50,942 --> 00:46:53,578
of the FBI in New Mexico.

615
00:46:53,711 --> 00:46:55,914
Your Honor, I'd also
like to note the presence
of the victims

616
00:46:56,047 --> 00:46:57,082
who are here this morning,

617
00:46:58,449 --> 00:47:00,618
Marie Schrader
and Blanca Gomez.

618
00:47:04,890 --> 00:47:07,458
William Oakley
appearing as advisory counsel.

619
00:47:07,592 --> 00:47:09,794
Saul Goodman appearing
on his own behalf.

620
00:47:09,928 --> 00:47:11,897
Good morning.

621
00:47:12,030 --> 00:47:14,632
The defendant still wants
to represent himself?

622
00:47:14,765 --> 00:47:16,902
Uh... That's right, your Honor.

623
00:47:18,269 --> 00:47:19,104
Okay.

624
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:24,342
The parties have reached
a plea agreement

625
00:47:24,475 --> 00:47:26,144
satisfactory to both sides.

626
00:47:26,277 --> 00:47:28,113
However, I have reviewed

627
00:47:28,246 --> 00:47:30,048
the government's
sentencing recommendations

628
00:47:30,181 --> 00:47:31,849
and...

629
00:47:31,983 --> 00:47:34,085
well, I have questions.

630
00:47:34,219 --> 00:47:37,188
Mr. Castellano, will you please
come up to the microphone?

631
00:47:44,829 --> 00:47:48,333
Mr. Castellano,
today we consider the sentence

632
00:47:48,466 --> 00:47:51,402
for a defendant
who will be pleading guilty

633
00:47:51,536 --> 00:47:54,139
to multiple felonies,
RICO offenses,

634
00:47:54,272 --> 00:47:56,174
money laundering, conspiracy,

635
00:47:56,307 --> 00:47:58,043
accessory after the fact

636
00:47:58,176 --> 00:48:00,311
to the murder
of federal officers.

637
00:48:02,147 --> 00:48:04,015
And for these offenses,

638
00:48:04,149 --> 00:48:08,853
the government's sentencing
recommendation is seven years.

639
00:48:08,987 --> 00:48:10,155
Your Honor,

640
00:48:10,288 --> 00:48:11,322
I can assure you
my colleagues and I

641
00:48:11,456 --> 00:48:12,857
gave every aspect
of this recommendation

642
00:48:12,991 --> 00:48:15,193
careful consideration.

643
00:48:15,326 --> 00:48:17,228
Help me understand.

644
00:48:17,362 --> 00:48:20,131
Has the defendant provided
substantial assistance
to the government?

645
00:48:20,265 --> 00:48:21,499
Your Honor?

646
00:48:21,632 --> 00:48:24,169
Mr. Oakley,
please advise your client

647
00:48:24,302 --> 00:48:25,836
to stay silent at this time.

648
00:48:25,971 --> 00:48:29,107
Your Honor, with respect,
Mr. Oakley is advisory counsel.

649
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:31,709
I'm representing myself
here today.

650
00:48:31,842 --> 00:48:34,212
If I may say something that
I think will help the court

651
00:48:34,345 --> 00:48:36,347
fully understand the situation?

652
00:48:36,481 --> 00:48:39,250
Mr. Goodman,
you are the beneficiary

653
00:48:39,384 --> 00:48:41,919
of the most generous
sentencing recommendation

654
00:48:42,053 --> 00:48:44,189
I've seen in 22 years
on the bench.

655
00:48:44,322 --> 00:48:47,858
Any statement you make
imperils that recommendation.

656
00:48:47,993 --> 00:48:49,327
I'm very aware of that,
Your Honor.

657
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:51,596
Uh, if you'll
allow me to speak,

658
00:48:51,729 --> 00:48:55,066
I-- I think I can save
the court's valuable time.

659
00:48:57,202 --> 00:48:58,936
Go ahead.

660
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:00,738
Briefly.

661
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:18,556
Two years ago
a man came into my office.

662
00:49:18,689 --> 00:49:21,859
He said his name was Mayhew.

663
00:49:21,993 --> 00:49:25,396
He wanted one of my clients
to lie for him under oath.

664
00:49:26,531 --> 00:49:28,599
He offered me money. I refused.

665
00:49:30,301 --> 00:49:33,438
That night, as I was leaving
my office, I was attacked.

666
00:49:34,605 --> 00:49:37,075
A bag was shoved over my head,

667
00:49:37,208 --> 00:49:38,409
I was hogtied,

668
00:49:38,543 --> 00:49:40,378
I was driven
out into the desert.

669
00:49:40,511 --> 00:49:41,812
And when they pulled
the hood off,

670
00:49:41,946 --> 00:49:44,115
I was kneeling
in front of an open grave

671
00:49:44,249 --> 00:49:45,616
with a gun pointed at my head.

672
00:49:47,052 --> 00:49:49,654
That was my introduction
to Walter White!

673
00:49:51,889 --> 00:49:53,091
I was terrified.

674
00:49:59,130 --> 00:49:59,930
But not for long.

675
00:50:03,468 --> 00:50:05,203
That night, I saw opportunity.

676
00:50:06,771 --> 00:50:08,706
A shot at big money.

677
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:11,609
And I grabbed it
and I held it tight.

678
00:50:11,742 --> 00:50:13,644
And for the next 16 months,

679
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:19,584
my every waking moment
was spent building
Walter White's drug empire.

680
00:50:19,717 --> 00:50:21,452
Hold on, Mr. Goodman.
Stop right there.

681
00:50:22,753 --> 00:50:25,623
Consult Mr. Oakley
before you say another word.

682
00:50:25,756 --> 00:50:28,859
Your Honor, I believe the court
deserves the whole truth.

683
00:50:28,993 --> 00:50:33,298
You are contradicting
your plea agreement's
sworn factual basis.

684
00:50:33,431 --> 00:50:34,865
No offense, Your Honor, but I--

685
00:50:34,999 --> 00:50:37,068
I think I know the law here
better than you do.

686
00:50:37,202 --> 00:50:39,204
Your Honor,
we'd like to request a recess.

687
00:50:39,337 --> 00:50:40,805
No, we do not need a recess.

688
00:50:40,938 --> 00:50:43,808
Your Honor, we are satisfied
for Mr. Goodman to continue.

689
00:50:43,941 --> 00:50:45,143
Your Honor,

690
00:50:45,276 --> 00:50:47,345
I'd like to petition
to withdraw from this case.

691
00:50:47,478 --> 00:50:49,780
- Denied.
- Respectfully--

692
00:50:49,914 --> 00:50:50,781
Not a chance.

693
00:50:54,519 --> 00:50:56,187
Bobbi, swear Mr. Goodman in.

694
00:51:01,192 --> 00:51:02,693
Do you swear that the evidence

695
00:51:02,827 --> 00:51:04,695
you shall give to the court
in this matter

696
00:51:04,829 --> 00:51:06,531
shall be the truth,
the whole truth,

697
00:51:06,664 --> 00:51:08,666
and nothing but the truth
so help you God?

698
00:51:08,799 --> 00:51:09,467
I do.

699
00:51:10,535 --> 00:51:12,537
Mr. Goodman,
you are now under oath.

700
00:51:14,305 --> 00:51:16,341
Any false statement you make

701
00:51:16,474 --> 00:51:17,508
can be used in prosecution

702
00:51:17,642 --> 00:51:20,378
for perjury
or obstruction of justice.

703
00:51:20,511 --> 00:51:21,579
Do you understand?

704
00:51:21,712 --> 00:51:23,514
- Yes.
- All right.

705
00:51:24,782 --> 00:51:25,916
In the last 24 hours,

706
00:51:26,050 --> 00:51:27,952
have you used
any alcohol or other drugs?

707
00:51:28,085 --> 00:51:29,254
No, Your Honor.

708
00:51:29,387 --> 00:51:31,289
Are you taking
any prescription medications?

709
00:51:31,422 --> 00:51:32,223
No.

710
00:51:33,023 --> 00:51:33,958
All right.

711
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:36,727
Continue.

712
00:51:44,635 --> 00:51:49,940
Oh, um,
I lied to the government
about, uh, Kim Wexler.

713
00:51:51,008 --> 00:51:53,378
Uh, I fed them a load of BS

714
00:51:53,511 --> 00:51:56,046
about her involvement
in Howard Hamlin's murder.

715
00:51:56,181 --> 00:51:59,049
I just-- I just wanted her
to come here today.

716
00:51:59,184 --> 00:52:00,418
I wanted her to hear this.

717
00:52:05,423 --> 00:52:07,458
So, yeah, I wasn't there
when the meth was cooked.

718
00:52:07,592 --> 00:52:09,627
I wasn't there
when it was sold.

719
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:11,296
I didn't witness
any of the murders,

720
00:52:11,429 --> 00:52:13,564
but I damn well knew
it was happening.

721
00:52:13,698 --> 00:52:16,066
I was more than
a willing participant.

722
00:52:16,201 --> 00:52:17,902
I was indispensable.

723
00:52:18,035 --> 00:52:19,704
I kept Walter White
out of jail,

724
00:52:19,837 --> 00:52:21,206
I laundered his money,

725
00:52:21,339 --> 00:52:23,741
I lied for him,
I conspired with him,

726
00:52:23,874 --> 00:52:25,576
and I made millions.

727
00:52:27,845 --> 00:52:29,580
If he hadn't walked
into my office that day,

728
00:52:30,648 --> 00:52:32,650
Walter White
would have been dead

729
00:52:32,783 --> 00:52:34,819
or behind bars within a month.

730
00:52:37,822 --> 00:52:40,925
And Agent Schrader
and Agent Gomez

731
00:52:41,058 --> 00:52:44,094
and a whole lot of other people
would still be alive.

732
00:52:47,732 --> 00:52:50,468
Fact is, Walter White
couldn't have
done it without me.

733
00:52:53,904 --> 00:52:56,241
You got that?

734
00:52:56,374 --> 00:52:58,976
Your Honor, we move to
strike Mr. Goodman's comments.

735
00:52:59,109 --> 00:53:00,445
On what grounds?

736
00:53:00,578 --> 00:53:02,547
- Um, speculation.
- Speculation?

737
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:04,549
He's testifying
to his own actions.

738
00:53:04,682 --> 00:53:06,951
Your Honor, uh,
he's describing events

739
00:53:07,084 --> 00:53:09,454
that would have transpired
had he acted differently.

740
00:53:09,587 --> 00:53:11,155
I have one more thing to say.

741
00:53:11,289 --> 00:53:13,491
- Sit down, Mr. Goodman. Now.
- Please, your Honor. Please.

742
00:53:13,624 --> 00:53:15,493
The government urges the court

743
00:53:15,626 --> 00:53:17,362
to allow Mr. Goodman
to continue.

744
00:53:17,495 --> 00:53:18,663
How is that
not speculation?

745
00:53:25,069 --> 00:53:26,136
All right, Mr. Goodman.

746
00:53:27,004 --> 00:53:28,005
Go ahead.

747
00:53:32,877 --> 00:53:35,880
What happened
to Howard Hamlin was...

748
00:53:37,282 --> 00:53:38,516
it was...

749
00:53:41,552 --> 00:53:43,053
I can't even...

750
00:53:47,858 --> 00:53:48,826
After that,

751
00:53:50,595 --> 00:53:53,364
Kim had the guts to start over.

752
00:53:53,498 --> 00:53:55,566
She left town, but...

753
00:53:58,536 --> 00:53:59,670
I'm the one who ran away.

754
00:54:05,142 --> 00:54:06,243
And my brother Chuck--

755
00:54:08,379 --> 00:54:09,714
Uh, Charles McGill.

756
00:54:10,481 --> 00:54:11,682
Y-You may have known him.

757
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:18,088
He was
an incredible lawyer, as--

758
00:54:18,222 --> 00:54:20,257
The most brilliant guy
I ever met.

759
00:54:20,391 --> 00:54:21,592
But he was limited.

760
00:54:23,227 --> 00:54:24,061
I tried.

761
00:54:25,896 --> 00:54:27,197
I could have tried harder.

762
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:30,701
I should have.

763
00:54:33,538 --> 00:54:35,706
- Instead, when--
- Your Honor.

764
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:38,275
Bill, please.
Just let me get through this.

765
00:54:40,244 --> 00:54:43,714
Instead, when I saw a chance
to hurt him, I took it.

766
00:54:48,052 --> 00:54:51,856
I got his malpractice insurance canceled.

767
00:54:51,989 --> 00:54:54,291
I took away
the one thing he lived for,

768
00:54:54,425 --> 00:54:55,393
the law.

769
00:54:58,696 --> 00:55:00,197
After that, he killed himself.

770
00:55:07,538 --> 00:55:08,739
And I'll live with that.

771
00:55:20,217 --> 00:55:21,752
What was all that?

772
00:55:21,886 --> 00:55:24,221
That thing with your brother,
that wasn't even a crime.

773
00:55:24,955 --> 00:55:25,923
Yeah, it was.

774
00:55:26,056 --> 00:55:30,628
Mr. Goodman,
sit down and stay seated.

775
00:55:30,761 --> 00:55:31,829
The name's McGill.

776
00:55:33,263 --> 00:55:34,264
I'm James McGill.

777
00:55:36,567 --> 00:55:38,135
Your Honor,
in view of the defendant's
confession...

778
00:55:38,268 --> 00:55:39,870
We'd like
to request a recess--

779
00:55:40,004 --> 00:55:41,672
- ...the Government withdraws its sentencing recommendation.
- Hold on.

780
00:55:41,806 --> 00:55:43,340
- That was not a confession.
- And urges this court

781
00:55:43,474 --> 00:55:45,376
to impose the statutory maximum
for each of these offenses.

782
00:55:45,510 --> 00:55:47,545
That was not a confession.
It was merely, uh,
a single point of view...

783
00:55:47,678 --> 00:55:49,680
Furthermore, your Honor,
a second additional hearing
is required...

784
00:55:49,814 --> 00:55:51,148
...in a very complex,
uh, narrative...

785
00:55:51,281 --> 00:55:52,417
...to assess
the additional claims
Mr. Goodman--

786
00:55:52,550 --> 00:55:54,351
I'm sorry-- Mr. McGill
has now admitted to,

787
00:56:03,928 --> 00:56:05,195
Did you ground yourself?

788
00:56:05,329 --> 00:56:06,664
Yes, I did!

789
00:56:06,797 --> 00:56:08,733
-
- Oh, crap!

790
00:56:20,545 --> 00:56:21,746
I was starting to worry.

791
00:56:21,879 --> 00:56:23,981
My car conked out on the 40.

792
00:56:24,114 --> 00:56:26,050
I almost got creamed
by a cement truck.

793
00:56:33,458 --> 00:56:34,659
Oh, um,

794
00:56:35,793 --> 00:56:37,795
they had those apples
that you like.

795
00:56:37,928 --> 00:56:40,731
I got you half a dozen Fuji.

796
00:56:40,865 --> 00:56:44,001
Um, and the newsstand
on Central

797
00:56:44,134 --> 00:56:46,571
said they might start carrying
the Financial Times.

798
00:56:46,704 --> 00:56:47,838
So that's good, right?

799
00:57:01,452 --> 00:57:02,820
What?

800
00:57:02,953 --> 00:57:04,755
You know I could
hire someone to do this.

801
00:57:04,889 --> 00:57:06,924
I could get someone
from the office.

802
00:57:07,658 --> 00:57:08,759
I'm doing it.

803
00:57:08,893 --> 00:57:10,795
Yeah, every day?

804
00:57:10,928 --> 00:57:13,430
While you're trying
to start a...practice?

805
00:57:13,564 --> 00:57:14,632
Why?

806
00:57:14,765 --> 00:57:15,733
Why?

807
00:57:17,401 --> 00:57:18,603
'Cause you're my brother.

808
00:57:18,736 --> 00:57:19,570
Duh.

809
00:57:19,704 --> 00:57:20,905
You'd do the same for me.

810
00:57:24,274 --> 00:57:26,343
Mm. Well,
you could stay for a while.

811
00:57:26,477 --> 00:57:27,778
We could talk.

812
00:57:28,513 --> 00:57:29,580
Talk? What about?

813
00:57:32,216 --> 00:57:34,685
Well, your cases. Your clients.

814
00:57:34,819 --> 00:57:36,621
You want to talk
about my clients?

815
00:57:36,754 --> 00:57:38,455
Seriously?

816
00:57:38,589 --> 00:57:42,059
You want to talk about,
uh, the granny who got
picked up for soliciting

817
00:57:42,192 --> 00:57:44,795
inside a Christian Science
Reading Room?

818
00:57:44,929 --> 00:57:47,798
Wh-- What about the kid
who broke into a liquor store

819
00:57:47,932 --> 00:57:49,967
and drank five bottles
of creme de menthe

820
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:51,736
and then passed out
behind the counter?

821
00:57:51,869 --> 00:57:53,470
They deserve
a vigorous defense.

822
00:57:53,604 --> 00:57:54,972
Like any other client.

823
00:57:56,941 --> 00:57:59,644
Or maybe you just wanna tell me
what I'm doing wrong.

824
00:57:59,777 --> 00:58:01,245
That's not what I had in mind.

825
00:58:13,558 --> 00:58:16,193
I'm hoping you didn't steal
that from a motel ice machine.

826
00:58:16,326 --> 00:58:16,927
You can hope.

827
00:58:19,096 --> 00:58:22,099
I'm gonna take a pass
on the heart-to-heart, Chuck.

828
00:58:22,232 --> 00:58:25,536
One of my "deserving" clients,

829
00:58:25,670 --> 00:58:28,939
he got caught waving the weenie
outside a Hobby Lobby.

830
00:58:30,407 --> 00:58:32,476
Hold on.
You got to reimburse yourself.

831
00:58:32,610 --> 00:58:34,812
Mm. This one's on me.

832
00:58:34,945 --> 00:58:35,813
Jimmy...

833
00:58:38,415 --> 00:58:40,150
If you don't like
where you're heading,

834
00:58:40,284 --> 00:58:43,353
there's no shame in going back
and changing your path.

835
00:58:46,123 --> 00:58:48,659
Uh, when have you ever
"changed your path"?

836
00:58:52,296 --> 00:58:55,733
Hey. Think on it.

837
00:58:55,866 --> 00:58:58,035
We always end up
having the same conversation,
don't we?

838
00:59:00,905 --> 00:59:02,940
I'll see ya tomorrow, Chuck.

839
00:59:03,073 --> 00:59:04,842
And I might have
the Financial Times.

840
01:00:53,984 --> 01:00:54,919
I know you?

841
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:11,135
Hey.

842
01:01:12,937 --> 01:01:13,971
"Better Call Saul."

843
01:01:15,405 --> 01:01:16,106
Right?

844
01:01:18,976 --> 01:01:19,977
McGill.

845
01:01:20,110 --> 01:01:21,011
What?

846
01:01:21,946 --> 01:01:23,113
I'm McGill.

847
01:01:24,348 --> 01:01:26,817
Don't give me that.

848
01:01:27,818 --> 01:01:29,186
You're Saul!

849
01:01:33,257 --> 01:01:34,191
It's Better Call Saul.

850
01:01:36,794 --> 01:01:38,128
No shit.

851
01:01:39,964 --> 01:01:40,831
Psst! Psst!

852
01:01:41,799 --> 01:01:42,800
Back here, yo.

853
01:01:47,571 --> 01:01:48,338
Back here.

854
01:01:56,646 --> 01:01:58,148
See? Toldja!

855
01:01:58,949 --> 01:02:00,017
It's Better Call Saul!

856
01:02:00,985 --> 01:02:03,020
You're right. Better Call Saul.

857
01:02:04,454 --> 01:02:05,689
Hi.

858
01:02:05,823 --> 01:02:08,058
Yeah. Better Call Saul.

859
01:02:10,494 --> 01:02:11,661
- Better...
-

860
01:02:11,796 --> 01:02:13,463
- Call...
-

861
01:02:13,597 --> 01:02:14,464
Saul.

862
01:02:15,866 --> 01:02:17,334
- Better...
-

863
01:02:17,467 --> 01:02:19,336
- Call...
-

864
01:02:19,469 --> 01:02:20,470
Saul.

865
01:02:22,239 --> 01:02:25,542
Better Call Saul!

866
01:02:27,677 --> 01:02:29,613
Better Call Saul!

867
01:02:30,714 --> 01:02:32,883
Better Call Saul!

868
01:02:34,351 --> 01:02:37,087
- All of you, shut up!
- Better Call Saul!

869
01:02:37,221 --> 01:02:40,224
- Better Call Saul!
- I said shut up!

870
01:02:40,357 --> 01:02:43,193
- Better Call Saul!
- Shut the hell up!

871
01:02:43,327 --> 01:02:46,230
- Better Call Saul!
- Shut the hell up!

872
01:02:46,363 --> 01:02:48,765
- Better Call Saul!
-

873
01:02:48,899 --> 01:02:49,934
Better Call...

874
01:03:10,487 --> 01:03:12,222
Saul! Lawyer's here!

875
01:03:17,661 --> 01:03:18,395
I got ya, Saul.

876
01:03:45,089 --> 01:03:47,124
- Ma'am?
- No cuffs, please.

877
01:03:55,966 --> 01:03:56,867
Thank you.

878
01:04:07,744 --> 01:04:08,712
Hi, Jimmy.

879
01:04:12,716 --> 01:04:13,450
Hi.

880
01:04:16,820 --> 01:04:19,256
How did you...

881
01:04:19,389 --> 01:04:21,591
Uh, turns out
my New Mexico bar card

882
01:04:21,725 --> 01:04:23,293
doesn't have
an expiration date.

883
01:05:32,896 --> 01:05:34,431
You had them down
to seven years.

884
01:05:37,067 --> 01:05:38,068
Yeah, I did.

885
01:05:48,012 --> 01:05:49,179
Eighty-six years.

886
01:05:58,488 --> 01:05:59,589
Eighty-six years.

887
01:06:10,267 --> 01:06:13,303
But with good behavior...

888
01:06:14,804 --> 01:06:15,772
who knows?

889
01:07:40,490 --> 01:07:41,491
Here we go, here we go.

890
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,469
慢点

891
00:01:08,602 --> 00:01:10,670
你会的

892
00:01:36,664 --> 00:01:38,666
你知道的。。。

893
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,901
我们坐在上面

894
00:01:41,033 --> 00:01:41,935
字面上

895
00:01:43,371 --> 00:01:44,238
和

896
00:01:48,209 --> 00:01:50,077
我说我们接受它，

897
00:01:50,211 --> 00:01:51,545
一半一半，

898
00:01:53,347 --> 00:01:54,414
起飞

899
00:01:55,348 --> 00:01:56,550
这不是我们的。

900
00:01:59,051 --> 00:01:59,920
可以是。

901
00:02:02,089 --> 00:02:03,524
是的，我认识一些人

902
00:02:03,657 --> 00:02:04,992
谁会呢

903
00:02:05,926 --> 00:02:06,794
他们

904
00:02:09,197 --> 00:02:10,163
别担心他们。

905
00:02:15,836 --> 00:02:16,737
你感觉对吗？

906
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:24,912
我们做的第一件事，

907
00:02:25,045 --> 00:02:27,581
拿六百万美元

908
00:02:29,049 --> 00:02:30,584
那些

909
00:02:31,885 --> 00:02:33,086
他们永远找不到我们。

910
00:02:36,857 --> 00:02:39,327
你会先去哪里？

911
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:42,596
-你看起来像个历史迷，对吧？

912
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:45,098
什么，你会去吗

913
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,302
嗯，古罗马？

914
00:02:48,436 --> 00:02:49,937
哦，天哪。

916
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:00,981
二○○一年十二月八日。

917
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:03,984
为什么？

918
00:03:05,286 --> 00:03:06,620
不，不。

919
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:13,126
1984年3月17日。

920
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,634
我第一次受贿的那天。

921
00:03:28,309 --> 00:03:29,477
然后我会继续前进。

922
00:03:31,978 --> 00:03:34,648
有些人我想去

923
00:03:35,749 --> 00:03:37,117
确保他们做得很好。

924
00:03:43,457 --> 00:03:44,425
你

925
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,295
这很容易。

926
00:03:49,297 --> 00:03:51,665
1965年5月10日。

927
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:58,038
这就是沃伦·巴菲特的日子

928
00:03:58,171 --> 00:03:59,673
接管

929
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:05,212
我想，还剩一百万

930
00:04:05,346 --> 00:04:07,548
所以我会拿我的那一半

931
00:04:07,681 --> 00:04:09,182
坚持下去

932
00:04:10,784 --> 00:04:13,253
然后我会回到这里。。。

933
00:04:14,622 --> 00:04:16,690
我是个亿万富翁。

935
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:24,698
有这样的事吗

936
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,702
就这样。钱

937
00:04:31,171 --> 00:04:31,739
还有什么？

938
00:04:32,806 --> 00:04:34,475
没什么你会改变的？

939
00:04:44,818 --> 00:04:45,719
我休息了。

940
00:05:26,627 --> 00:05:27,928
 马里恩

941
00:05:28,061 --> 00:05:30,498
对这是一场比赛--

942
00:05:30,631 --> 00:05:32,832
米色。我--

943
00:05:37,438 --> 00:05:38,772
六十四，P。。。

944
00:05:42,476 --> 00:05:44,077
…F，T，六。

945
00:05:44,211 --> 00:05:46,346
他向南走，

946
00:05:48,115 --> 00:05:49,783
哦，请把他找来。

947
00:05:57,825 --> 00:05:59,159
 12-14响应。

948
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:02,696
 在那10-29，V代表维克多。

949
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:04,331
 那是土星光环

950
00:06:04,465 --> 00:06:05,833
 没错。

951
00:06:05,966 --> 00:06:09,837
 土星光环，内布拉斯加州

952
00:06:14,842 --> 00:06:17,978
 白人男性，40多岁，

953
00:09:02,643 --> 00:09:07,480
“胡佛马克斯提取物

954
00:09:07,615 --> 00:09:12,620
胡佛压力专业

955
00:10:00,367 --> 00:10:01,234
有人在家吗？

956
00:10:07,675 --> 00:10:08,942
手。现在

957
00:10:29,229 --> 00:10:30,463
 我参加了一个聚会，

958
00:10:30,597 --> 00:10:31,799
 只管自己的事。

959
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:35,903
 你被捕了。

960
00:10:36,036 --> 00:10:37,270
 我最好叫索尔

961
00:10:38,739 --> 00:10:40,073
 嗨。我是索尔·古德曼。

962
00:10:40,207 --> 00:10:42,009
 你知道吗

963
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:44,644
 宪法上说你会的

964
00:10:44,778 --> 00:10:46,646
 我相信，

965
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:49,649
 每个男人、女人和孩子

966
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:52,552
 这就是我为你而战的原因，

967
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:13,941
你好，克丽斯塔？是基恩。

968
00:11:16,043 --> 00:11:18,445
呃，呃，对不起

969
00:11:18,578 --> 00:11:19,612
你开门了吗？

970
00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:24,117
我很好。

971
00:11:26,887 --> 00:11:29,456
本周轮换

972
00:11:29,589 --> 00:11:30,357
你能处理吗？

973
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,127
嗯，还有一件事。嗯。。。

974
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:37,130
打电话给总公司就行了。

975
00:11:37,264 --> 00:11:39,266
数字

976
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:41,534
然后，呃，让他们知道，嗯。。。

977
00:11:44,805 --> 00:11:46,406
你会需要的

978
00:11:51,178 --> 00:11:52,980
他们就是这样抓到你的？

979
00:11:54,314 --> 00:11:56,616
这是怎么回事

980
00:11:58,251 --> 00:11:59,987
这是怎么回事

981
00:12:01,889 --> 00:12:04,157
他们就是这样抓到你的？

982
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:07,060
这是怎么回事

983
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,561
上帝啊

984
00:12:09,863 --> 00:12:11,164
你在想什么？

985
00:12:13,633 --> 00:12:17,570
什么…我们。。。

987
00:12:26,847 --> 00:12:27,680
倒霉！

988
00:13:06,753 --> 00:13:08,488
啊!！啊!！嘿

989
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:13,226
我需要另一个电话！

990
00:13:30,577 --> 00:13:32,145
威廉·奥克利及其同事，

991
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:34,447
“信任经验，

992
00:13:34,581 --> 00:13:36,083
我是比尔·奥克利。

993
00:13:36,216 --> 00:13:38,051
 “信任体验，

994
00:13:38,185 --> 00:13:39,953
 我喜欢这样。它很吸引人。

995
00:13:40,087 --> 00:13:41,688
 你知道这是谁，对吧

996
00:13:45,792 --> 00:13:46,759
索尔？

997
00:13:46,894 --> 00:13:48,996
 你明白了，伙计。

998
00:13:49,129 --> 00:13:51,298
你是什么--

999
00:13:51,431 --> 00:13:53,400
嗯，什么--

1000
00:13:53,533 --> 00:13:55,602
呃，你知道我会的

1001
00:13:55,735 --> 00:13:57,437
 哇。冷静点，孩子。

1002
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:59,139
 警察知道

1003
00:13:59,272 --> 00:14:00,440
 他们可能在监听。

1004
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:02,242
 事实是，

1005
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:04,177
 警察局的

1006
00:14:06,146 --> 00:14:07,814
所以他们终于抓住你了。

1007
00:14:07,948 --> 00:14:09,616
 听着。今天是你的幸运日。

1008
00:14:09,749 --> 00:14:13,954
 我正在和索尔·古德曼的通话

1009
00:14:14,087 --> 00:14:15,122
什么

1010
00:14:15,255 --> 00:14:17,925
继续，比尔。

1011
00:14:18,058 --> 00:14:19,192
 “咨询顾问？”

1012
00:14:19,326 --> 00:14:21,061
这让你

1013
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:22,629
这是你要做的。

1014
00:14:22,762 --> 00:14:25,465
你要搭飞机吗

1015
00:14:25,598 --> 00:14:26,799
没有直接的，

1016
00:14:26,934 --> 00:14:28,568
所以你必须这样做

1017
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:30,670
谁来付钱？

1018
00:14:30,803 --> 00:14:33,306
 -你是。听着 你听到了吗

1019
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,209
砰，砰！

1020
00:14:36,343 --> 00:14:38,311
滚开

1021
00:14:38,445 --> 00:14:39,980
好的，在路上

1022
00:14:40,113 --> 00:14:41,214
 -等等。等待等一下。

1023
00:14:41,348 --> 00:14:43,183
即使假设，

1024
00:14:43,316 --> 00:14:44,851
我愿意

1025
00:14:44,985 --> 00:14:46,886
 “愿意”

1026
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:48,455
 现实一点。你正在这样做。

1027
00:14:48,588 --> 00:14:51,658
地方检察官有一个仓库

1028
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:54,361
我甚至无法想象

1029
00:14:54,494 --> 00:14:58,198
 无论你的律师是谁，

1030
00:14:58,331 --> 00:14:59,832
 所以我得问问…

1031
00:14:59,967 --> 00:15:01,201
 你在哪里看到这个结局

1032
00:15:04,437 --> 00:15:06,039
我在哪里看到它的结局？嗯。。。

1033
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:34,667
 里科。

1034
00:15:34,801 --> 00:15:36,069
 不是五个，不是十个。

1035
00:15:36,203 --> 00:15:38,771
但是二十七

1036
00:15:38,905 --> 00:15:40,307
联邦阴谋

1037
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,674
受控物质。

1038
00:15:41,808 --> 00:15:44,311
在这种规模上？

1039
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:45,645
洗钱

1040
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:47,380
八次，每次20年。

1041
00:15:47,514 --> 00:15:50,217
一百六十年，

1042
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:52,585
我们会为你辩护的

1043
00:15:52,719 --> 00:15:55,155
附件

1044
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:58,391
包括两个装饰件

1045
00:15:58,525 --> 00:15:59,459
每人15年。

1046
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:02,729
根据我们的统计，

1047
00:16:02,862 --> 00:16:04,531
一百九十。

1048
00:16:04,664 --> 00:16:06,399
生命加上190年。

1049
00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:11,738
好吧

1050
00:16:11,871 --> 00:16:14,241
一次性，

1051
00:16:14,374 --> 00:16:17,810
标题是：30年。

1052
00:16:17,944 --> 00:16:20,413
保持你的鼻子干净，

1053
00:16:20,547 --> 00:16:22,415
你有机会看看

1054
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:28,821
奥克利先生，你的“协理律师”

1055
00:16:29,889 --> 00:16:31,958
他和我们在一起吗？

1056
00:16:32,092 --> 00:16:34,961
呃，听着，你有

1057
00:16:35,095 --> 00:16:37,064
-你为什么不邀请她进来？

1058
00:16:37,197 --> 00:16:38,631
我是说，你欠她的

1059
00:16:38,765 --> 00:16:39,999
哦，不，她--

1060
00:16:40,133 --> 00:16:42,135
认罪谈判。

1061
00:16:42,269 --> 00:16:43,436
她已经来了。

1062
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:45,004
双方同意。

1063
00:17:27,214 --> 00:17:29,482
他们告诉我他们找到你了

1064
00:17:32,185 --> 00:17:33,486
嗯，这是有道理的。

1065
00:17:37,624 --> 00:17:39,526
我丈夫是伴郎

1066
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:44,164
他活着是为了帮助别人。

1067
00:17:45,998 --> 00:17:49,302
如果有人遇到麻烦，

1068
00:17:49,436 --> 00:17:52,505
无论在什么地方，

1069
00:17:56,643 --> 00:17:57,777
带着微笑和玩笑。

1070
00:18:01,514 --> 00:18:03,583
他很善良，

1071
00:18:04,951 --> 00:18:05,885
他很正派，

1072
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:08,020
他很强壮。

1073
00:18:11,858 --> 00:18:12,759
他的搭档。。。

1074
00:18:16,062 --> 00:18:17,029
史蒂夫·戈麦斯。

1075
00:18:17,164 --> 00:18:19,732
史蒂夫和布兰卡

1076
00:18:19,866 --> 00:18:22,935
建造了一个温暖的家

1077
00:18:24,671 --> 00:18:25,538
三个孩子。

1078
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:31,711
三个没有父亲的孩子。

1079
00:18:34,214 --> 00:18:36,716
汉克和史蒂夫，好人。

1080
00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:40,019
他们被枪杀了

1081
00:18:41,588 --> 00:18:43,256
然后留在洞里

1082
00:18:46,259 --> 00:18:47,126
和你。

1083
00:18:48,861 --> 00:18:50,163
你帮助了我

1084
00:18:50,297 --> 00:18:52,932
两面派

1085
00:18:56,035 --> 00:18:56,803
为了什么？

1086
00:18:58,171 --> 00:18:59,038
钱

1087
00:19:01,774 --> 00:19:04,577
你这么做都是为了钱。

1088
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:09,081
不管怎样

1089
00:19:09,216 --> 00:19:11,150
不管他们把你放在哪里

1090
00:19:11,284 --> 00:19:14,287
这永远不够。

1091
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:26,165
施拉德夫人。

1092
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:31,137
损失

1093
00:19:31,271 --> 00:19:32,305
这是无法形容的。

1094
00:19:37,844 --> 00:19:40,913
我见过你丈夫几次。

1095
00:19:42,815 --> 00:19:45,117
他是个男人

1096
00:19:45,252 --> 00:19:46,619
他的工作非常出色。

1097
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:48,855
直截了当的人。

1098
00:19:51,324 --> 00:19:52,492
你和他是。。。

1099
00:19:54,093 --> 00:19:54,694
受害者。

1100
00:19:59,098 --> 00:19:59,832
我也是。

1101
00:20:05,972 --> 00:20:08,641
两年前

1102
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:12,211
他说他的名字叫梅休。

1103
00:20:13,946 --> 00:20:17,149
他想要我的一个客户

1104
00:20:17,284 --> 00:20:18,551
他给了我钱。

1105
00:20:19,852 --> 00:20:21,187
我拒绝了。

1106
00:20:21,321 --> 00:20:22,322
任何律师都会。

1107
00:20:24,324 --> 00:20:28,828
那天晚上，我正要离开

1108
00:20:30,763 --> 00:20:32,565
两个人

1109
00:20:32,699 --> 00:20:34,233
他们大嚼我，

1110
00:20:34,367 --> 00:20:36,669
他们开车送我

1111
00:20:36,803 --> 00:20:38,505
当他们拉动时

1112
00:20:38,638 --> 00:20:41,674
我跪着

1113
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:45,812
用枪指着我的头。

1114
00:20:45,945 --> 00:20:48,047
这是我的介绍

1115
00:20:52,352 --> 00:20:53,553
从那一刻起，

1116
00:20:55,322 --> 00:20:57,690
一分钟也没有

1117
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:02,395
是 啊我为他工作。

1118
00:21:02,529 --> 00:21:04,631
但这不是我做这件事的原因。

1119
00:21:04,764 --> 00:21:09,035
我这样做是因为

1120
00:21:09,168 --> 00:21:12,071
一遍又一遍，我想

1121
00:21:12,204 --> 00:21:14,674
我甚至想过

1122
00:21:14,807 --> 00:21:19,111
但我知道沃尔特·怀特

1123
00:21:20,413 --> 00:21:21,714
我是对的。

1124
00:21:23,015 --> 00:21:23,716
你查一下。

1125
00:21:24,751 --> 00:21:27,854
2009年10月4日。

1126
00:21:27,987 --> 00:21:32,525
他们杀了十个人

1127
00:21:32,659 --> 00:21:33,893
在两分钟的时间内。

1128
00:21:34,594 --> 00:21:35,495
被刺伤。

1129
00:21:36,363 --> 00:21:38,064
喉咙被割伤。

1130
00:21:38,197 --> 00:21:40,767
一名男子被活活烧死。

1131
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:44,103
他们甚至被杀了

1132
00:21:44,236 --> 00:21:46,138
他在合作

1133
00:21:48,408 --> 00:21:49,442
丹尼尔·沃克斯伯格。

1134
00:21:51,277 --> 00:21:56,516
消息说

1135
00:21:59,018 --> 00:22:03,055
所以，是的，

1136
00:22:03,189 --> 00:22:04,256
但不是来自警方。

1137
00:22:05,392 --> 00:22:05,925
从他们那里。

1138
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,762
沃尔特·怀特可能已经死了，

1139
00:22:09,896 --> 00:22:12,098
但是杰西·平克曼

1140
00:22:12,231 --> 00:22:14,266
他们还在外面的某个地方。

1141
00:22:18,237 --> 00:22:18,971
施拉德夫人。。。

1142
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:23,876
你在看一个男人

1143
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:26,779
这是我的职业。

1144
00:22:27,814 --> 00:22:29,949
我一个人也没有。

1145
00:22:30,082 --> 00:22:30,783
我什么都没有。

1146
00:22:40,927 --> 00:22:42,795
你觉得呢

1147
00:22:47,066 --> 00:22:47,967
一

1148
00:22:50,603 --> 00:22:51,804
我只需要一个。

1149
00:22:56,108 --> 00:22:59,078
奥克利告诉我的

1150
00:23:01,013 --> 00:23:02,114
是这样吗？

1151
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:07,053
这是一个地狱般的记录。

1152
00:23:07,186 --> 00:23:08,020
还

1153
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:10,022
陪审团，对吧？

1154
00:23:11,524 --> 00:23:13,693
呼。你永远不知道。

1155
00:23:13,826 --> 00:23:15,194
这是一个掷骰子的游戏。

1156
00:23:17,497 --> 00:23:19,699
我只是希望

1157
00:23:22,802 --> 00:23:25,337
你不会去的

1158
00:23:25,472 --> 00:23:26,272
你不是。

1159
00:23:57,103 --> 00:23:57,504
十七

1160
00:23:58,738 --> 00:24:01,207
在判刑之后

1161
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:05,077
到

1162
00:24:05,211 --> 00:24:07,279
政府

1163
00:24:07,413 --> 00:24:09,882
数到三到九

1164
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:12,919
十八

1165
00:24:13,052 --> 00:24:15,287
根据事实

1166
00:24:15,421 --> 00:24:18,157
预期的

1167
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:20,059
当组合时

1168
00:24:20,192 --> 00:24:23,095
对于预期的罪犯

1169
00:24:23,229 --> 00:24:24,897
结果得到预期的结果

1170
00:24:25,031 --> 00:24:27,233
咨询判决

1171
00:24:27,366 --> 00:24:30,069
监禁85至90个月，

1172
00:24:30,202 --> 00:24:32,605
此外

1173
00:24:32,739 --> 00:24:35,708
罚款和赔偿

1174
00:24:38,911 --> 00:24:40,379
七年半。

1175
00:24:42,148 --> 00:24:43,482
让我们开始吧

1176
00:24:43,616 --> 00:24:44,751
然后离开这里。

1177
00:24:44,884 --> 00:24:45,785
我们对此很在行。

1178
00:24:45,918 --> 00:24:48,120
“十九岁。”

1179
00:24:48,254 --> 00:24:52,892
“在下列地点送达的期限：

1180
00:24:53,025 --> 00:24:53,926
D翼。“

1181
00:24:56,696 --> 00:24:58,831
FCI Butner低。

1182
00:24:58,965 --> 00:25:02,334
这是个好地方。

1183
00:25:02,468 --> 00:25:05,304
这是唯一的选择

1184
00:25:05,437 --> 00:25:06,773
这已经足够好了

1185
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,109
这是真正的请求吗？

1186
00:25:10,242 --> 00:25:11,844
你在开玩笑吗？

1187
00:25:11,978 --> 00:25:13,279
我给你们半个机会，

1188
00:25:13,412 --> 00:25:15,181
你要把我扔进监狱吗

1189
00:25:16,983 --> 00:25:19,351
我拜访过一位客户

1190
00:25:20,486 --> 00:25:22,855
“落基山脉的恶魔岛”

1191
00:25:22,989 --> 00:25:24,957
不，不，那是个破坏交易的人，

1192
00:25:34,667 --> 00:25:36,969
FCI Butner低。翼

1193
00:25:37,103 --> 00:25:38,771
D、 翼D。

1194
00:25:41,507 --> 00:25:43,610
现在我们完成了。

1195
00:25:43,743 --> 00:25:47,246
啊，就像史蒂夫·乔布斯常说的，

1196
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:49,081
“二十。”

1197
00:25:49,215 --> 00:25:52,318
“在监禁期间，

1198
00:25:52,451 --> 00:25:54,887
一品脱蓝色铃铛

1199
00:25:55,021 --> 00:25:57,356
在此期间，每周五。”

1200
00:25:57,489 --> 00:25:58,324
你在开玩笑吗？

1201
00:25:58,457 --> 00:25:59,926
他在开玩笑。

1202
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:01,560
“蓝铃

1203
00:26:01,694 --> 00:26:02,662
没有替代品。

1204
00:26:02,795 --> 00:26:04,764
可以就这样。

1205
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:07,166
等等

1206
00:26:07,299 --> 00:26:09,301
-别再玩游戏了。

1207
00:26:09,435 --> 00:26:11,003
这不是我说过的。

1208
00:26:11,137 --> 00:26:12,872
这是一个新的舞台。这是一种原始的东西。

1209
00:26:18,711 --> 00:26:19,511
去

1210
00:26:20,647 --> 00:26:21,914
内部故事，

1211
00:26:22,048 --> 00:26:24,516
前所未闻

1212
00:26:26,385 --> 00:26:28,821
它涉及一个突出的问题

1213
00:26:28,955 --> 00:26:30,823
谁，呃，失踪了，

1214
00:26:30,957 --> 00:26:33,459
据信有

1215
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:34,927
霍华德·哈姆林？

1216
00:26:35,061 --> 00:26:36,629
你在说话

1217
00:26:36,763 --> 00:26:37,730
那是你的“甜味剂”？

1218
00:26:39,966 --> 00:26:41,100
他想出卖我们

1219
00:26:43,069 --> 00:26:44,536
他想

1220
00:26:45,738 --> 00:26:47,039
听起来像你和你的前任

1221
00:26:47,173 --> 00:26:49,642
你不说话吗

1222
00:26:49,776 --> 00:26:53,379
金·韦克斯勒走进房间

1223
00:26:53,512 --> 00:26:57,549
她大发雷霆

1224
00:26:57,684 --> 00:26:59,218
你有

1225
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,388
这是最后一次机会。

1226
00:27:02,521 --> 00:27:05,224
我们要去审判吗，

1227
00:27:07,126 --> 00:27:08,027
对

1228
00:27:08,695 --> 00:27:10,730
是的，我们有协议。

1229
00:27:47,133 --> 00:27:48,467
啊。当然

1230
00:28:03,249 --> 00:28:05,785
我会后悔吗

1231
00:28:06,753 --> 00:28:08,687
我要阻止它。

1232
00:28:08,821 --> 00:28:10,689
停下来干什么？

1233
00:28:14,226 --> 00:28:16,495
听不，听我说。

1234
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,034
那个咔哒声？

1235
00:28:22,168 --> 00:28:23,002
点击。

1236
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:27,039
火焰正在燃烧

1237
00:28:27,173 --> 00:28:29,976
然后它就一直出去。

1238
00:28:30,109 --> 00:28:34,646
所以要么

1239
00:28:34,781 --> 00:28:35,982
或者我们有一个短。

1240
00:28:37,349 --> 00:28:40,486
热电偶被腐蚀。

1241
00:28:40,619 --> 00:28:43,055
嘿，呃，也许我们可以

1242
00:28:43,189 --> 00:28:45,191
-或者割断电线什么的？

1243
00:28:45,324 --> 00:28:51,330
我看没有理由

1244
00:28:51,463 --> 00:28:53,099
当它的东西

1245
00:28:53,232 --> 00:28:54,867
啊哈！

1246
00:28:55,001 --> 00:28:56,435
我想这会成功的。

1247
00:28:58,504 --> 00:29:00,539
你不会碰巧有

1248
00:29:00,672 --> 00:29:02,041
在其中一个袋子中，

1249
00:29:02,174 --> 00:29:02,975
不

1250
00:29:03,709 --> 00:29:05,177
什么说话！

1251
00:29:05,812 --> 00:29:06,645
不

1252
00:29:18,657 --> 00:29:19,591
来吧

1253
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:32,004
是 啊这应该行得通。

1254
00:29:49,188 --> 00:29:51,023
嘿，你是科学家，对吧？

1255
00:29:51,157 --> 00:29:53,125
所以，呃，我有个问题。

1256
00:29:53,259 --> 00:29:54,927
你会怎么做

1257
00:29:56,562 --> 00:29:58,397
时间机器？

1258
00:30:00,066 --> 00:30:01,800
是的，嗯。。。

1259
00:30:01,934 --> 00:30:03,602
来自科学家的

1260
00:30:05,571 --> 00:30:06,805
呃，你要去哪里？

1261
00:30:06,939 --> 00:30:09,108
一个毫无意义的问题。

1262
00:30:09,241 --> 00:30:10,442
时间--

1263
00:30:10,576 --> 00:30:12,678
时间机器。

1264
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:15,347
看，时间旅行，

1265
00:30:15,481 --> 00:30:17,416
这种时间旅行

1266
00:30:17,549 --> 00:30:19,651
这在科学上是不可能的。

1267
00:30:19,785 --> 00:30:22,554
这将违反第二定律

1268
00:30:22,688 --> 00:30:25,424
-那虫洞呢？

1269
00:30:25,557 --> 00:30:27,960
嗯，我在看＜I＞新星＜/I＞节目

1270
00:30:28,094 --> 00:30:30,963
哦，那么艾伦·阿尔达，

1271
00:30:31,097 --> 00:30:33,632
哦，天哪。你在开玩笑吧？

1272
00:30:33,765 --> 00:30:36,268
量子力学？

1273
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:39,471
留在你的车道上。

1274
00:30:44,776 --> 00:30:47,113
这只是一个思想实验。

1275
00:30:47,246 --> 00:30:48,948
一定有什么事

1276
00:30:49,081 --> 00:30:50,082
如果可以的话。

1277
00:30:55,554 --> 00:30:59,525
哦，你没说话

1278
00:30:59,658 --> 00:31:02,294
这两者都是真实的

1279
00:31:03,629 --> 00:31:05,431
你说的是遗憾。

1280
00:31:05,564 --> 00:31:08,700
所以如果你想问

1281
00:31:08,834 --> 00:31:11,703
问问后悔的事就行了

1282
00:31:11,837 --> 00:31:15,007
然后离开这一切

1283
00:31:15,141 --> 00:31:16,508
可以遗憾，那么。

1284
00:31:20,812 --> 00:31:21,480
遗憾。

1285
00:31:22,614 --> 00:31:23,315
是 啊

1286
00:31:27,253 --> 00:31:28,720
这是我的遗憾。好吧，好吧。。。

1287
00:31:33,625 --> 00:31:34,493
我的遗憾。。。

1288
00:31:51,277 --> 00:31:52,178
好

1289
00:32:00,852 --> 00:32:03,189
当我还是研究生的时候，

1290
00:32:03,322 --> 00:32:05,257
我开了一家公司

1291
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:10,029
当时，我想

1292
00:32:11,998 --> 00:32:16,602
我们的目标是

1293
00:32:18,904 --> 00:32:21,540
在某一点上。。。

1294
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:26,512
我走开了。

1295
00:32:26,645 --> 00:32:28,380
我以为我在做

1296
00:32:30,249 --> 00:32:31,650
但我一点也不明白

1297
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:34,786
他们是

1298
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,655
离开我自己的创作。

1299
00:32:40,592 --> 00:32:42,294
如果我留下来，哦。。。

1300
00:32:45,097 --> 00:32:45,831
好

1301
00:32:48,034 --> 00:32:49,801
我不会的

1302
00:32:51,303 --> 00:32:53,772
所以你开了一家公司。

1303
00:32:55,874 --> 00:32:56,775
哦，是的。

1304
00:32:58,244 --> 00:32:59,811
它成功了吗？

1305
00:33:01,647 --> 00:33:03,115
非常

1306
00:33:03,249 --> 00:33:05,517
你怎么可能永远不会呢

1307
00:33:05,651 --> 00:33:07,819
我们本来可以的

1308
00:33:07,953 --> 00:33:10,622
错误终止，

1309
00:33:10,756 --> 00:33:12,224
呃，专利欺诈。

1310
00:33:12,358 --> 00:33:14,126
我是说，我可以

1311
00:33:15,694 --> 00:33:18,997
你会是最后一个律师

1312
00:33:21,267 --> 00:33:22,701
-嗯。当然

1313
00:33:26,738 --> 00:33:27,739
那你呢？

1314
00:33:29,975 --> 00:33:31,143
-什么？

1315
00:33:35,981 --> 00:33:37,015
等等。我有一个。

1316
00:33:42,988 --> 00:33:44,290
你知道吗？不要介意。

1317
00:33:44,423 --> 00:33:45,524
我20岁的时候--

1318
00:33:45,657 --> 00:33:47,559
嗯,22,，

1319
00:33:47,693 --> 00:33:50,028
我滑倒了

1321
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:54,466
我又笨又年轻

1322
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,402
所以我撞到冰上了

1323
00:33:56,535 --> 00:33:58,970
我狠狠地咬了它，

1324
00:33:59,105 --> 00:34:01,540
呼。

1325
00:34:01,673 --> 00:34:05,010
我真的伤到自己了。

1326
00:34:05,144 --> 00:34:07,646
我是说，我的膝盖

1327
00:34:10,315 --> 00:34:12,118
“滑倒”？

1328
00:34:12,251 --> 00:34:15,353
是 啊我就是这么说的

1329
00:34:23,562 --> 00:34:24,496
所以

1330
00:34:30,001 --> 00:34:31,503
所以你总是这样。

1331
00:35:26,858 --> 00:35:27,626
很抱歉

1332
00:35:34,032 --> 00:35:35,334
嘘！账单嘿

1333
00:35:36,235 --> 00:35:37,403
我正要去--

1334
00:35:37,536 --> 00:35:39,104
先生，这个人

1335
00:35:39,238 --> 00:35:40,206
我是美国元帅。

1336
00:35:41,507 --> 00:35:43,575
我请你不要和他说话。

1337
00:35:43,709 --> 00:35:44,576
那是我的律师。

1338
00:35:47,012 --> 00:35:47,879
这是真的吗？

1339
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,216
对

1340
00:35:50,349 --> 00:35:52,150
你还有其他机会

1341
00:35:52,284 --> 00:35:53,084
请离开走道。

1342
00:35:53,219 --> 00:35:54,753
不，等等。

1343
00:35:54,886 --> 00:35:57,456
我在你面前没说什么

1344
00:35:58,224 --> 00:35:59,491
这是正确的。

1345
00:35:59,625 --> 00:36:01,860
所以如果我和我的律师谈谈

1346
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:03,695
这可能会有帮助

1347
00:36:03,829 --> 00:36:05,464
你可以把它传下去

1348
00:36:05,597 --> 00:36:06,432
完全干净。

1349
00:36:07,233 --> 00:36:08,099
对的

1350
00:36:09,768 --> 00:36:12,103
考虑到这一点，你确定吗

1351
00:36:19,278 --> 00:36:20,178
快点。

1352
00:36:22,281 --> 00:36:25,551
她承认了。

1353
00:36:25,684 --> 00:36:28,620
没有证人，

1354
00:36:28,754 --> 00:36:31,357
如果让我猜的话，

1355
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:32,491
永久地

1356
00:36:34,426 --> 00:36:35,294
可以

1357
00:36:36,328 --> 00:36:38,730
不，不是“好的”

1358
00:36:38,864 --> 00:36:40,699
不适合她。

1359
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:42,234
然后呢？

1360
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:46,037
显然，金姆带走了她

1361
00:36:46,171 --> 00:36:48,139
并亲手交付

1362
00:36:48,274 --> 00:36:50,008
-不。

1363
00:36:50,141 --> 00:36:52,210
她敞开心扉

1364
00:36:52,344 --> 00:36:54,546
寡妇可以带走她

1365
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:57,349
还有一切

1366
00:36:57,483 --> 00:36:59,084
那么，她是谁？起诉？

1367
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:03,021
听着，我只能告诉你

1368
00:37:03,154 --> 00:37:06,325
是哈姆林太太出去了吗

1369
00:37:07,493 --> 00:37:08,694
并不是说她烦恼

1370
00:37:13,098 --> 00:37:15,834
嘿，我能，呃，

1371
00:37:18,337 --> 00:37:19,170
我要走了。

1372
00:37:47,699 --> 00:37:48,900
等等，比尔。

1373
00:37:49,034 --> 00:37:51,269
不，等等。

1374
00:37:51,403 --> 00:37:53,204
哈姆林事件？

1375
00:37:53,339 --> 00:37:54,773
我们一着陆，

1376
00:37:54,906 --> 00:37:56,241
我想要你

1377
00:37:56,375 --> 00:37:58,043
我还有更多

1378
00:37:58,176 --> 00:37:59,611
我刚刚想起一件事

1379
00:37:59,745 --> 00:38:00,712
那会让他们的脚趾弯曲。

1380
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:03,281
可以

1381
00:38:03,415 --> 00:38:05,417
任何能使

1382
00:38:05,551 --> 00:38:07,419
肯定会把金弄得一团糟。

1383
00:38:07,553 --> 00:38:08,820
如果涉及到她。

1384
00:38:08,954 --> 00:38:11,089
哦，这涉及到她。

1385
00:38:11,222 --> 00:38:13,925
金已经有民事诉讼了

1386
00:38:14,059 --> 00:38:16,127
你给政府更多，

1387
00:38:16,261 --> 00:38:17,729
也许他们会带来

1388
00:38:20,231 --> 00:38:21,400
你还能得到什么？

1389
00:38:21,533 --> 00:38:22,934
还剩下什么？

1390
00:38:23,068 --> 00:38:24,403
你不明白。

1391
00:38:24,536 --> 00:38:26,472
这真是一个很好的冰淇淋。

1392
00:38:51,229 --> 00:38:53,098
-又是男孩？

1393
00:38:53,231 --> 00:38:55,401
她没睡

1394
00:38:55,534 --> 00:38:57,403
-至少。

1395
00:38:57,536 --> 00:38:58,837
她不得不这么做。

1396
00:38:58,970 --> 00:39:00,105
乔希是双胞胎，不是吗？

1397
00:39:00,238 --> 00:39:02,508
哦，是的。而且它是

1398
00:39:02,641 --> 00:39:04,510
我总是带他出去，

1399
00:39:04,643 --> 00:39:06,311
因为，你知道，

1400
00:39:06,445 --> 00:39:07,178
嗯，那很好。

1401
00:39:07,312 --> 00:39:08,747
要么是红龙虾

1402
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,282
还是那个新的

1403
00:39:11,417 --> 00:39:13,118
-在什么上面？

1404
00:39:13,251 --> 00:39:15,020
就这样。托普卡比。

1405
00:39:15,153 --> 00:39:17,656
格伦带你去的，不是吗？

1406
00:39:17,789 --> 00:39:20,025
呃，不是。。。

1407
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:22,360
不好吧？

1408
00:39:23,495 --> 00:39:25,363
不，不，没事。

1409
00:39:25,497 --> 00:39:26,465
乔希喜欢吗？

1410
00:39:29,468 --> 00:39:30,969
他，他可能。

1411
00:39:31,102 --> 00:39:33,472
可以又一个生日

1412
00:39:33,605 --> 00:39:35,574
他可以接受。

1413
00:39:35,707 --> 00:39:38,343
我们做了什么

1414
00:39:38,477 --> 00:39:40,912
是的，一个不错的

1415
00:39:41,046 --> 00:39:43,248
双胞胎？他们可能需要

1416
00:40:07,739 --> 00:40:08,840
你也是，唐尼。

1417
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:15,346
西娜，唐尼

1418
00:40:15,481 --> 00:40:18,349
嘿，塔米。我要早点走。

1419
00:40:18,484 --> 00:40:19,350
-当然。没问题。

1420
00:40:19,485 --> 00:40:20,251
谢谢

1421
00:40:21,487 --> 00:40:22,654
棕榈海岸洒水车。

1422
00:40:22,788 --> 00:40:24,656
从1978年开始为你的世界浇水。

1423
00:41:40,799 --> 00:41:43,034
如果他出现，

1424
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:45,671
你报警，

1425
00:41:45,804 --> 00:41:47,272
任何时间，白天或晚上。

1426
00:41:47,405 --> 00:41:48,306
可以

1427
00:41:48,439 --> 00:41:49,775
-好的。

1428
00:41:49,908 --> 00:41:51,843
让我知道

1429
00:41:51,977 --> 00:41:53,178
-好的。非常感谢。

1430
00:41:59,985 --> 00:42:01,587
女士们，这边走。

1431
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:04,122
对不起，太热了。

1432
00:42:14,032 --> 00:42:16,702
填好这个。

1433
00:42:16,835 --> 00:42:18,469
我们所有的服务都是免费的。

1434
00:42:18,604 --> 00:42:22,007
哦，事实上，我在这儿

1435
00:42:22,841 --> 00:42:24,309
你想当志愿者吗？

1436
00:42:24,442 --> 00:42:25,711
-对。

1437
00:42:25,844 --> 00:42:27,278
你能接电话吗？

1438
00:42:27,412 --> 00:42:28,346
当然

1439
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:29,981
那你就去吧。

1440
00:42:37,255 --> 00:42:38,990
佛罗里达州中部法律援助中心。

1441
00:43:18,764 --> 00:43:21,299
-喂？

1442
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:24,169
-对 -我是苏珊娜·埃里克森。

1443
00:43:24,302 --> 00:43:25,036
嗨，苏珊娜。

1444
00:43:25,904 --> 00:43:27,072
我想说清楚

1445
00:43:27,205 --> 00:43:28,273
这个电话

1446
00:43:29,307 --> 00:43:30,041
 好的。

1447
00:43:31,209 --> 00:43:32,878
我甚至不应该

1448
00:43:33,011 --> 00:43:34,212
但考虑到一切，

1449
00:43:34,345 --> 00:43:35,947
我认为这是完全正确的

1450
00:43:36,882 --> 00:43:37,615
 你看过新闻了吗

1451
00:43:39,350 --> 00:43:40,618
我不这么认为。

1452
00:43:40,752 --> 00:43:42,620
 你的前任，索尔·古德曼

1453
00:43:43,889 --> 00:43:45,757
 他在内布拉斯加州被捕。

1454
00:43:45,891 --> 00:43:47,258
 他已被引渡

1455
00:43:51,730 --> 00:43:53,064
这是什么时候？

1456
00:43:53,198 --> 00:43:54,099
 两天前。

1457
00:43:55,566 --> 00:43:56,902
 但这不是我打电话的原因。

1458
00:43:58,436 --> 00:44:01,639
 他在作证

1459
00:44:05,376 --> 00:44:06,712
什么样的证词？

1460
00:44:24,362 --> 00:44:30,969

全体起立

1477
00:46:00,025 --> 00:46:02,760
法庭现在开庭。

1478
00:46:07,833 --> 00:46:11,202
好的日历上的第一项，

1479
00:46:12,403 --> 00:46:16,207
美国CR 10-7253

1480
00:46:18,343 --> 00:46:21,379
被告要求：

1481
00:46:21,512 --> 00:46:25,750
所以它是美国

1482
00:46:25,884 --> 00:46:27,385
律师，请陈述

1483
00:46:30,355 --> 00:46:32,858
奥萨·乔治·卡斯特拉诺。

1484
00:46:32,991 --> 00:46:35,894
和我在一起的是伊丽莎白·努里亚尼，

1485
00:46:36,027 --> 00:46:40,198
法院的审判律师

1486
00:46:40,331 --> 00:46:43,768
AUSAs Sarah Braddock，

1487
00:46:43,902 --> 00:46:47,105
还有负责的特工

1488
00:46:47,238 --> 00:46:48,806
也出现在法庭上，

1489
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:50,808
扎卡里·埃尔南德斯，

1490

新墨西哥州的联邦调查局。

1491
00:46:53,711 --> 00:46:55,914
法官大人，我也希望

1492
00:46:56,047 --> 00:46:57,082
今天早上谁在这里，

1493
00:46:58,449 --> 00:47:00,618
玛丽·施拉德

00:47:09,928 --> 00:47:11,897
早上好

1497
00:47:12,030 --> 00:47:14,632
被告仍然想要

1498
00:47:14,765 --> 00:47:16,902
嗯……没错，法官大人。

1499
00:47:18,269 --> 00:47:19,104
可以

1500
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:24,342
双方已达成协议

1501
00:47:24,475 --> 00:47:26,144
双方都满意。

1502
00:47:26,277 --> 00:47:28,113
然而，我已经回顾了

1503
00:47:28,246 --> 00:47:30,048
政府的

1504
00:47:30,181 --> 00:47:31,849
和

1505
00:47:31,983 --> 00:47:34,085
嗯，我有问题。

1506
00:47:34,219 --> 00:47:37,188
卡斯特拉诺先生，请你

1507
00:47:44,829 --> 00:47:48,333
卡斯特拉诺先生，

1508
00:47:48,466 --> 00:47:51,402
对于被告

1509
00:47:51,536 --> 00:47:54,139
对于多起重罪，

1510
00:47:54,272 --> 00:47:56,174
洗钱、阴谋，

1511
00:47:56,307 --> 00:47:58,043
事后从犯

1512
00:47:58,176 --> 00:48:00,311
谋杀案

1513
00:48:02,147 --> 00:48:04,015
对于这些罪行，

1514
00:48:04,149 --> 00:48:08,853
政府的判决

1515
00:48:08,987 --> 00:48:10,155
法官大人，

1516
00:48:10,288 --> 00:48:11,322
我可以向你保证

1517
00:48:11,456 --> 00:48:12,857
给每个方面

1518
00:48:12,991 --> 00:48:15,193
仔细考虑。

1519
00:48:15,326 --> 00:48:17,228
帮我理解。

1520
00:48:17,362 --> 00:48:20,131
被告是否提供：

1521
00:48:20,265 --> 00:48:21,499
法官大人？

1522
00:48:21,632 --> 00:48:24,169
奥克利先生，

1523
00:48:24,302 --> 00:48:25,836
在这个时候保持沉默。

1524
00:48:25,971 --> 00:48:29,107
法官大人，恕我直言，

1525
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:31,709
我代表我自己

1526
00:48:31,842 --> 00:48:34,212
请允许我说点什么

1527
00:48:34,345 --> 00:48:36,347
完全了解情况？

1528
00:48:36,481 --> 00:48:39,250
古德曼先生，

1529
00:48:39,384 --> 00:48:41,919
最慷慨的

1530
00:48:42,053 --> 00:48:44,189
我已经看了22年了

1531
00:48:44,322 --> 00:48:47,858
你有什么声明吗

1532
00:48:47,993 --> 00:48:49,327
我很清楚这一点，

1533
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:51,596
呃，如果你愿意的话

1534
00:48:51,729 --> 00:48:55,066
我想我能救你

1535
00:48:57,202 --> 00:48:58,936
着手

1536
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:00,738
短暂地

1537
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:18,556
两年前

1538
00:49:18,689 --> 00:49:21,859
他说他的名字叫梅休。

1539
00:49:21,993 --> 00:49:25,396
他想要我的一个客户

1540
00:49:26,531 --> 00:49:28,599
他给了我钱。我拒绝了。

1541
00:49:30,301 --> 00:49:33,438
那天晚上，我正要离开

1542
00:49:34,605 --> 00:49:37,075
一个袋子被推到我头上，

1543
00:49:37,208 --> 00:49:38,409
我被困住了，

1544
00:49:38,543 --> 00:49:40,378
我被驱使着

1545
00:49:40,511 --> 00:49:41,812
当他们拉动时

1546
00:49:41,946 --> 00:49:44,115
我跪着

1547
00:49:44,249 --> 00:49:45,616
用枪指着我的头。

1548
00:49:47,052 --> 00:49:49,654
这是我的介绍

1549
00:49:51,889 --> 00:49:53,091
我吓坏了。

1550
00:49:59,130 --> 00:49:59,930
但不会太久。

1551
00:50:03,468 --> 00:50:05,203
那天晚上，我看到了机会。

1552
00:50:06,771 --> 00:50:08,706
一笔巨款。

1553
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:11,609
我抓住了它

1554
00:50:11,742 --> 00:50:13,644
在接下来的16个月里，

1555
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:19,584
我醒着的每一刻

1556
00:50:19,717 --> 00:50:21,452
等等，古德曼先生。

1557
00:50:22,753 --> 00:50:25,623
咨询奥克利先生

1558
00:50:25,756 --> 00:50:28,859
法官大人我相信法庭

1559
00:50:28,993 --> 00:50:33,298
你在自相矛盾

1560
00:50:33,431 --> 00:50:34,865
无意冒犯法官大人但我--

1561
00:50:34,999 --> 00:50:37,068
我想我知道这里的法律

1562
00:50:37,202 --> 00:50:39,204
法官大人，

1563
00:50:39,337 --> 00:50:40,805
不，我们不需要休息。

1564
00:50:40,938 --> 00:50:43,808
法官大人我们很满意

1565
00:50:43,941 --> 00:50:45,143
法官大人，

1566
00:50:45,276 --> 00:50:47,345
我想请愿

1567
00:50:47,478 --> 00:50:49,780
-否认。

1568
00:50:49,914 --> 00:50:50,781
不可能。

1569
00:50:54,519 --> 00:50:56,187
鲍比，向古德曼先生发誓。

1570
00:51:01,192 --> 00:51:02,693
你发誓证据确凿吗

1571
00:51:02,827 --> 00:51:04,695
你应向法庭提出上诉

1572
00:51:04,829 --> 00:51:06,531
将是真理，

1573
00:51:06,664 --> 00:51:08,666
只有真相

1574
00:51:08,799 --> 00:51:09,467
我愿意。

1575
00:51:10,535 --> 00:51:12,537
古德曼先生，

1576
00:51:14,305 --> 00:51:16,341
你所作的任何虚假陈述

1577
00:51:16,474 --> 00:51:17,508
可用于起诉

1578
00:51:17,642 --> 00:51:20,378
伪证罪

1579
00:51:20,511 --> 00:51:21,579
你明白吗？

1580
00:51:21,712 --> 00:51:23,514
-对。

1581
00:51:24,782 --> 00:51:25,916
在过去24小时内，

1582
00:51:26,050 --> 00:51:27,952
你习惯了吗

1583
00:51:28,085 --> 00:51:29,254
不法官大人。

1584
00:51:29,387 --> 00:51:31,289
你要吃什么

1585
00:51:31,422 --> 00:51:32,223
不

1586
00:51:33,023 --> 00:51:33,958
好吧

1587
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:36,727
持续

1588
00:51:44,635 --> 00:51:49,940
哦,嗯,，

1589
00:51:51,008 --> 00:51:53,378
呃，我喂了他们一大堆废话

1590
00:51:53,511 --> 00:51:56,046
关于她的参与

1591
00:51:56,181 --> 00:51:59,049
我只是，我只是想要她

1592
00:51:59,184 --> 00:52:00,418
我想让她听到这个。

1593
00:52:05,423 --> 00:52:07,458
所以，是的，我不在那里

1594
00:52:07,592 --> 00:52:09,627
我不在那里

1595
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:11,296
我没有作证

1596
00:52:11,429 --> 00:52:13,564
但我他妈的很清楚

1597
00:52:13,698 --> 00:52:16,066
我不止一次

1598
00:52:16,201 --> 00:52:17,902
我是不可或缺的。

1599
00:52:18,035 --> 00:52:19,704
我让沃尔特保持白色

1600
00:52:19,837 --> 00:52:21,206
我洗了他的钱，

1601
00:52:21,339 --> 00:52:23,741
我为他撒谎，

1602
00:52:23,874 --> 00:52:25,576
我赚了几百万。

1603
00:52:27,845 --> 00:52:29,580
如果他没有走的话

1604
00:52:30,648 --> 00:52:32,650
沃尔特·怀特

1605
00:52:32,783 --> 00:52:34,819
或者在一个月内坐牢。

1606
00:52:37,822 --> 00:52:40,925
还有施拉德探员

1607
00:52:41,058 --> 00:52:44,094
还有很多其他人

1608
00:52:47,732 --> 00:52:50,468
事实上，沃尔特·怀特

1609
00:52:53,904 --> 00:52:56,241
你明白了吗？

1610
00:52:56,374 --> 00:52:58,976
法官大人，我们要去

1611
00:52:59,109 --> 00:53:00,445
基于什么理由？

1612
00:53:00,578 --> 00:53:02,547
-嗯，猜测。

1613
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:04,549
他在作证

1614
00:53:04,682 --> 00:53:06,951
法官大人，

1615
00:53:07,084 --> 00:53:09,454
那会发生的

1616
00:53:09,587 --> 00:53:11,155
我还有一件事要说。

1617
00:53:11,289 --> 00:53:13,491
-请坐，古德曼先生。现在

1618
00:53:13,624 --> 00:53:15,493
政府敦促法院：

1619
00:53:15,626 --> 00:53:17,362
允许古德曼先生

1620
00:53:17,495 --> 00:53:18,663
这是怎么回事

1621
00:53:25,069 --> 00:53:26,136
好的，古德曼先生。

1622
00:53:27,004 --> 00:53:28,005
着手

1623
00:53:32,877 --> 00:53:35,880
怎么搞的？

1624
00:53:37,282 --> 00:53:38,516
这是。。。

1625
00:53:41,552 --> 00:53:43,053
我简直无语了。

1626
00:53:47,858 --> 00:53:48,826
之后，

1627
00:53:50,595 --> 00:53:53,364
金姆有勇气重新开始。

1628
00:53:53,498 --> 00:53:55,566
她离开了小镇，但是。。。

1629
00:53:58,536 --> 00:53:59,670
我是那个逃跑的人。

1630
00:54:05,142 --> 00:54:06,243
还有我弟弟查克--

1631
00:54:08,379 --> 00:54:09,714
查尔斯·麦吉尔。

1632
00:54:10,481 --> 00:54:11,682
你可能认识他。

1633
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:18,088
他是

1634
00:54:18,222 --> 00:54:20,257
最聪明的人

1635
00:54:20,391 --> 00:54:21,592
但他是有限的。

1636
00:54:23,227 --> 00:54:24,061
我试过了。

1637
00:54:25,896 --> 00:54:27,197
我本可以更努力的。

1638
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:30,701
我应该有。

1639
00:54:33,538 --> 00:54:35,706
-相反，当--

1640
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:38,275
请给我比尔。

1641
00:54:40,244 --> 00:54:43,714
相反，当我看到一个机会

1642
00:54:48,052 --> 00:54:51,856
我取消了他的医疗事故保险。

1643
00:54:51,989 --> 00:54:54,291
我拿走了

1644
00:54:54,425 --> 00:54:55,393
法律。

1645
00:54:58,696 --> 00:55:00,197
之后，他自杀了。

1646
00:55:07,538 --> 00:55:08,739
我会接受的。

1647
00:55:20,217 --> 00:55:21,752
那是什么？

1648
00:55:21,886 --> 00:55:24,221
你哥哥的那件事，

1649
00:55:24,955 --> 00:55:25,923
是的，是的。

1650
00:55:26,056 --> 00:55:30,628
古德曼先生，

1651
00:55:30,761 --> 00:55:31,829
我叫麦吉尔。

1652
00:55:33,263 --> 00:55:34,264
我是詹姆斯·麦吉尔。

1653
00:55:36,567 --> 00:55:38,135
法官大人，

1654
00:55:38,268 --> 00:55:39,870
我们想要

1655
00:55:40,004 --> 00:55:41,672
-……政府撤回其判刑建议。

1656
00:55:41,806 --> 00:55:43,340
-那不是认罪。

1657
00:55:43,474 --> 00:55:45,376
施加法定最高限额

1658
00:55:45,510 --> 00:55:47,545
那不是认罪。

1659
00:55:47,678 --> 00:55:49,680
此外，法官阁下，

1660
00:55:49,814 --> 00:55:51,148
…在非常复杂的情况下，

1661
00:55:51,281 --> 00:55:52,417
…评估

1662
00:55:52,550 --> 00:55:54,351
对不起，麦吉尔先生

1663
00:56:03,928 --> 00:56:05,195
你把自己摔倒了吗？

1664
00:56:05,329 --> 00:56:06,664
是的，我做到了！

1665
00:56:20,545 --> 00:56:21,746
我开始担心了。

1666
00:56:21,879 --> 00:56:23,981
我的车在40号公路上抛锚了。

1667
00:56:24,114 --> 00:56:26,050
我差一点喝到奶油

1668
00:56:33,458 --> 00:56:34,659
哦,嗯,，

1669
00:56:35,793 --> 00:56:37,795
他们有那些苹果

1670
00:56:37,928 --> 00:56:40,731
我给你买了半打富士牌。

1671
00:56:40,865 --> 00:56:44,001
嗯，还有报摊

1672
00:56:44,134 --> 00:56:46,571
说他们可能会开始携带

1673
00:56:46,704 --> 00:56:47,838
那很好，对吧？

1674
00:57:01,452 --> 00:57:02,820
什么

1675
00:57:02,953 --> 00:57:04,755
你知道我可以

1676
00:57:04,889 --> 00:57:06,924
我可以找个人

1677
00:57:07,658 --> 00:57:08,759
我正在做。

1678
00:57:08,893 --> 00:57:10,795
是啊，每天？

1679
00:57:10,928 --> 00:57:13,430
当你努力的时候

1680
00:57:13,564 --> 00:57:14,632
为什么？

1681
00:57:14,765 --> 00:57:15,733
为什么？

1682
00:57:17,401 --> 00:57:18,603
因为你是我哥哥。

1684
00:57:19,704 --> 00:57:20,905
你也会为我做同样的事。

1686
00:57:26,477 --> 00:57:27,778
我们可以谈谈。

1687
00:57:28,513 --> 00:57:29,580
说话那么...怎么样

1688
00:57:32,216 --> 00:57:34,685
好吧，你的案子。你的客户。

1689
00:57:34,819 --> 00:57:36,621
你想谈谈吗

1690
00:57:36,754 --> 00:57:38,455
认真地

1691
00:57:38,589 --> 00:57:42,059
你想谈谈，

1692
00:57:42,192 --> 00:57:44,795
在基督教科学中

1693
00:57:44,929 --> 00:57:47,798
那孩子呢

1694
00:57:47,932 --> 00:57:49,967
喝了五瓶

1695
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:51,736
然后昏倒了

1696
00:57:51,869 --> 00:57:53,470
这是他们应得的

1697
00:57:53,604 --> 00:57:54,972
和其他客户一样。

1698
00:57:56,941 --> 00:57:59,644
或者你只是想告诉我

1699
00:57:59,777 --> 00:58:01,245
那不是我想的。

1700
00:58:13,558 --> 00:58:16,193
我希望你没有偷

1701
00:58:16,326 --> 00:58:16,927
你可以期待。

1702
00:58:19,096 --> 00:58:22,099
我要走了

1703
00:58:22,232 --> 00:58:25,536
我的一个“当之无愧”的客户，

1704
00:58:25,670 --> 00:58:28,939
他挥舞小玩意被抓住了

1705
00:58:30,407 --> 00:58:32,476
等等

1706
00:58:32,610 --> 00:58:34,812
这个我请客。

1707
00:58:34,945 --> 00:58:35,813
吉米。。。

1708
00:58:38,415 --> 00:58:40,150
如果你不喜欢

1709
00:58:40,284 --> 00:58:43,353
回去没有什么丢脸的

1710
00:58:46,123 --> 00:58:48,659
呃，你什么时候去过

1711
00:58:52,296 --> 00:58:55,733
嘿想想看。

1712
00:58:55,866 --> 00:58:58,035
我们总是以失败告终

1713
00:59:00,905 --> 00:59:02,940
明天见，查克。

1714
00:59:03,073 --> 00:59:04,842
而我可能会

1715
01:00:53,984 --> 01:00:54,919
我认识你？

1717
01:01:12,937 --> 01:01:13,971
“最好叫索尔。”

1718
01:01:15,405 --> 01:01:16,106
正当

1719
01:01:18,976 --> 01:01:19,977
麦吉尔。

1720
01:01:20,110 --> 01:01:21,011
什么

1721
01:01:21,946 --> 01:01:23,113
我是麦吉尔。

1722
01:01:24,348 --> 01:01:26,817
别给我这个。

1723
01:01:27,818 --> 01:01:29,186
你是索尔！

1724
01:01:33,257 --> 01:01:34,191
最好打电话给索尔。

1725

嗯，原来

1757

不必

1758
01:05:32,896 --> 01:05:34,431
你让他们下来了

谁知道呢？

1764
