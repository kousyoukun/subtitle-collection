直接投到伯克希尔

00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,600
没有直飞的航班
There's nothing direct,

143
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,460
你得在休斯顿转机
so you're gonna have to connect through Houston.

144
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,550
这钱谁付
Wh-- Who's paying for this?

145
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:33,250
-你付  听  你听到了吗  -听到什么
- You are. Listen. You hear that? - Hear what?

146
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:36,060
当  当  机会在敲门
Bang, bang! That's opportunity knocking.

147
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:38,190
赶紧起来开门
Get off your ass and answer the door.

148
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:39,690
好了  去机场的路上
Okay, on your way to the airport...

149
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:41,210
-等等  等一下  -我需要你打几个电话
- Wait. Wait. Hold on. - ...I need you to make some calls.

150
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:43,140
即便假设
Even supposing, hypothetically,

151
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:44,640
我愿意接你的案子...
I'd be willing to take this on--

152
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,800
还"愿意"  比尔  这是功成名就的机会
"Willing"? Bill, this is a career-maker.

153
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,010
现实点  你要接的
Get real. You're doing this.

154
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:51,400
地检有一仓库的证据治你的罪
The DA has a warehouse of evidence against you--

155
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:54,130
我都不敢想联调局有你多少证据
I can't even begin to imagine what the Feds are sitting on.

156
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,920
不管你找谁当律师  你都完蛋了
No matter who your lawyer is, you are screwed.

157
00:14:58,070 --> 00:14:59,260
所以我得问一句
So I've gotta ask...

158
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:01,240
你觉得会如何收场
Where do you see this ending?

159
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:05,520
我觉得会如何收场
Where do I see it ending?

160
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,810
以我成功收场
With me on top.

161
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:10,140
一如往常
Like always.

162
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:18,880
{\an8}道格拉斯县监狱

00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:34,410
诈骗
Rico.

164
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:35,990
不是五项十项
Not five, not ten,

165
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:38,390
而是27项犯罪
but twenty-seven predicate violations.

166
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:40,400
在全国范围内密谋制造分销
Federal conspiracy to manufacture and distribute

167
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,710
管制物品
a controlled substance.

168
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:44,280
你这种规模  最高可以判终身监禁
On this scale? Life sentence, stat max.

169
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,460
洗钱
Money laundering.

170
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:47,200
八项  每项二十年
Eight counts, 20 years each.

171
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,590
最高可以判160年
One hundred sixty years, stat max.

172
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:52,320
我们会争取刑期分开连续执行
We'll argue for consecutive sentencing.

173
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,760
多起谋杀案的事后从犯

174
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:58,190
包括两名联邦功勋警官
Including two decorated federal officers.

175
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,810
每项15年
Fifteen years each.

176
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:02,530
根据我们计算  这是终身监禁外加
By our count, that's life plus...

177
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:03,760
190年有期徒刑
One hundred ninety.

178
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:06,770
终身监禁外加190年
Life plus 190 years.

179
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,720
好了  我愿意给你一次
All right. I'm willing to extend

180
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,900
爱要不要的机会
a one-time, take-it-or-leave-it offer.

181
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:17,210
听好了  30年有期徒刑
Here's the headline: 30 years.

182
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:19,780
不惹是生非  保持健康
Keep your nose clean, stay healthy,

183
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:22,540
你有可能在晚年重见天日
you have a shot at seeing daylight in your old age.

184
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:29,130
奥克利先生  你的"合伙律师"
Mr. Oakley, your "Co-counsel,"

185
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,170
他同意吗
is he here with us?

186
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:34,820
施罗德探员的遗孀在那边
Uh, listen, you've got Agent Schrader's widow back there.

187
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:36,850
-不如请她进来吧  -等一下...
- Why don't you invite her in? - Uh, wait a sec--

188
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:38,210
你们亏欠她的  对吧
I mean, you owe her that much, don't you?

189
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:39,750
她不能出席...
Well, no, she-- she can't be present at a--

190
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,880
认罪谈判  这非常不合适
a plea negotiation. It's completely inappropriate.

191
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:42,780
她人都来了
She's already here.

192
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:45,190
双方同意  没关系  真的
Both parties agree. It's fine. Really.

193
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:29,600
他们告诉我  是在垃圾箱里找到你的
They tell me they found you in a garbage dumpster.

194
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:33,510
很合理
Well, that makes sense.

195
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,840
我丈夫是我认识的最好的人
My husband was the best man that I have ever known.

196
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:44,300
他活着就为帮助别人
He lived to help others.

197
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:49,000
要是有人遇到困难  不管什么时间
If somebody was in trouble, no matter the time,

198
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,740
不管什么地点  汉克·施罗德都会帮他

面带微笑  不失风趣

200

他为人和善

201
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,950
体面
he was decent,

202
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,070
坚强
he was strong.

203
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:12,910
他的搭档

204
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:16,760
史蒂夫·戈麦斯

史蒂夫和布兰卡的家

00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,700
汉克和史蒂夫  都是好人
Hank and Steve, the good guys.

210
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,010
他们被枪杀
They were shot dead

211
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:43,460
扔在沙漠的坑里
and left in a hole in the desert.

212
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:47,250
而你
And you.

213
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:49,770
是你帮了
You helped

214
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:53,120
那个幕后凶手  两面派的恶毒混蛋
the two-faced poisonous bastard behind it all.

215
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,650
为了什么
For what?

216
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:58,950
钱
Money.

217
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:04,790
你做这些就是为了钱
You did it all for money.

218
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:08,820
不论他们现在如何处置你
No matter what they do with you now,

219
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:11,230
不论把你关在何地  关上多久
no matter where they put you or for how long,

220
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:14,540
都不够谢罪的
it will never be enough.

221
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:26,490
施罗德太太
Mrs... Mrs. Schrader.

222
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,630
你的丧夫之痛
The loss that you've suffered...

223
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,460
是无法形容的
It's unspeakable.

224
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:41,230
我见过你丈夫几次
I met your husband a few times.

225
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:44,490
他是一个一诺千金的人
He was a man who stood by his word

226
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:46,780
非常能干
and was very good at his job.

227
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,030
直言不讳
A straight shooter.

228
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:52,380
你和他都是
You and he are...

229
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:54,970
受害者
victims.

230
00:19:58,790 --> 00:19:59,920
我也是
And so am I.

231
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:08,900
两年前一个人走进我的办公室
Two years ago a man came into my office.

232
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:12,360
他自称梅休
He said his name was Mayhew.

233
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:17,260
他想让我的一个当事人作伪证
He wanted one of my clients to lie under oath.

234
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:18,530
他承诺给我钱
He offered me money.

235
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:20,810
我拒绝了
I declined.

236
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,390
是律师都会拒绝的
Any lawyer would.

237
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:29,070
当天晚上我离开办公室时遭到了袭击
That night, as I was leaving my office, I was attacked.

238
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:32,550
两个人往我头上套了个袋子
Two men threw a sack over my head,

239
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:33,810
给我五花大绑
they hogtied me,

240
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:36,180
开车把我带到了沙漠里
and they drove me out into the desert.

241
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:37,900
他们把头套拿掉时
And when they pulled the hood off,

242
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:41,820
我跪在地上  面前是个挖好的坟墓
I was kneeling in front of an open grave.

243
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:45,240
头上顶着一把枪
With a gun pointed at my head.

244
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:48,420
我就是这样认识沃尔特·怀特的
That was my introduction to Walter White.

245
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:53,390
从那一刻起
From that moment on,

246
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:58,010
我没有一刻不感到害怕
there hasn't been a minute that I wasn't afraid.

247
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:02,390
没错  我是给他干活  也赚了很多钱
Yeah. I worked for him. I made a lot of money.

248
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,120
但我干那些并不是因为钱
But that's not why I did it.

249
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:08,550
而是因为我知道如果我拒绝  他会怎么对付我
I did it because I knew what he would do to me if I refused.

250
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:11,880
我一次又一次想过报警
Over and over, I thought about going to the police.

251
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:14,170
甚至想过找施罗德探员
I even thought about talking to Agent Schrader.

252
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:19,360
但我知道无论去了哪  沃尔特·怀特都会杀了我
But I knew that Walter White would kill me, wherever I was.

253
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:21,640
而且我是对的
And I was right.

254
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:23,910
你们去查查
You look it up.

255
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,200
2009年10月4日
October 4, 2009.

256
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:32,450
他们在两分钟内
They murdered ten men inside three prisons

257
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:34,170
在三个监狱里杀死了十个人
in the space of two minutes.

258
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:35,510
用刀捅死
Knifed.

259
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:37,990
割喉
Throats slashed.

260
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:39,930
一个人被活活烧死
A man was burned alive.

261
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:43,630
他们甚至杀了我的一位同行  一名律师
They even killed one of my colleagues, a lawyer.

262
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:46,510
他当时与毒品管制局合作
He was cooperating with the DEA.

263
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:49,580
丹尼尔·华兹伯格
Daniel Wachsburger.

264
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:56,750
新闻上说丹被捅了48刀
The news said Dan was stabbed 48 times.

265
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:02,900
没错  事情败露后我逃了
So, yeah, when it all blew up, I ran.

266
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:04,410
但不是躲避警方
But not from the police.

267
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:06,000
而是躲避他们
From them.

268
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:09,490
沃尔特·怀特可能是死了
Walter White might be dead,

269
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:11,910
但杰西·平克曼和其他人呢
but Jesse Pinkman and the others?

270
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:14,520
他们还在什么地方逍遥法外呢
They're still out there, somewhere.

271
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,150
施罗德太太...
Mrs. Schrader...

272
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:23,370
你面前是一个失去了一切的人
you are looking at a man who has lost everything.

273
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:26,710
我的职业  我的家庭  我的自由
My profession. My family. My freedom.

274
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,620
我...  我没有依靠
I have-- I have nobody.

275
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:30,970
我一无所有
I have nothing.

276
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:43,010
你觉得陪审团会吃你这一套吗
And you think jurors are gonna buy that?

277
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:47,830
一个
One.

278
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:51,690
只要一个人信就够了
All I need is one.

279
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:59,440
奥克利告诉我你从来没打输过官司
Oakley tells me that you've never lost a case.

280
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:01,990
是这样吗
Is that so?

281
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:06,970
了不起的记录  你应该感到自豪
That's a hell of a record. You should be proud of that.

282
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:07,990
不过...
Still...

283
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:10,380
陪审团嘛  对吧
Juries, right?

284
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:13,100
你永远也说不准
You never can tell.

285
00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:15,280
就是掷骰子
It's a roll of the dice.

286
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,930
我只是...  我希望有点商量的余地
I'm just-- I'm hoping there's some wiggle room.

287
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:25,300
你不可以与这个人讨价还价
You are not going to negotiate with this man.

288
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:26,340
不可以
You're not.

289
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:57,820
十七
Seventeen.

290
00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:01,090

检方将撤销

十八
Eighteen.

295
00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:15,180
根据目前检方所掌握的事实
Based on the facts now known to the government,

296
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:18,120
预期的罪过等级是35级
the anticipated offense level is 35,

297
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,750
再加上
which, when combined

298
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:22,960

罚款和赔偿等法庭可能施加的处罚
fine, and restitution the Court may impose.

七年半
Seven and a half years.

304
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:44,580
我们把这玩意儿签了  赶紧结束了吧
Let's get this thing signed and get the hell out of here.

305
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,730
我们没意见
We're good with that.

306
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,000
"十九"
"Nineteen."

307

布特纳低戒备度监狱

是唯一有高尔夫活动安排的联邦监狱
It's the only federal institution with a golf program.

伯尼·麦道夫都觉得可以接受...
It was good enough for Bernie Madoff...

314
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,930
你认真的吗
This is an actual request?

315
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:11,560
开什么玩笑
Are you kidding?

316
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:12,780
我稍微一不留神
I give you guys half a chance,

317
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:15,530
你们就会把我扔进关普通囚犯的鬼地方去
you're gonna throw me into gen pop in some hellhole.

318
00:25:16,530 --> 00:25:19,630
我曾经去过蒙特罗斯超级监狱看望某个委托人
I visited a client once at ADX Montrose.

319
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:22,450
"洛基山脉的恶魔岛"
"The Alcatraz of the Rockies."

320
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:25,390
不行不行  这条绝对不能让步  朋友
No. No, that's a dealbreaker, my friend.

321
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:36,820
布特纳低戒备度监狱...
FCI Butner Low. Wing...

322
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:38,360
D  是D区
D. Wing D.

323
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:40,370
"D区"
"Wing D."

324
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:42,800
就这样了
And now we are done.

325
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:46,970
就像史蒂夫·乔布斯经常说的  还有一项
Ah, as Steve Jobs used to say, one more thing.

330
00:25:57,210 --> 00:25:58,140
你开玩笑呢吧
Are you kidding?

331
00:25:58,500 --> 00:25:59,440
他开玩笑呢
He's kidding.

332
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:01,400
"蓝铃牌薄荷口味带巧克力碎"
"Blue Bell Mint Chocolate Chip."

不得替换
No substitutions.

334
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:04,600
好  就这样吧
Okay. That's it.

335
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:07,130
等等  我可以让大家都更满意
Hold on. I can oil everybody's locks.

336
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:09,030
-别玩把戏了  -不是  我还有个甜头呢
- No more games. - No. I got a sweetener.

337
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:10,800
是我之前没讲过的
It's nothing I've talked about.

338
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:13,110
新的领域  重大爆料
New arena. Primo stuff.

339
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:19,430
说吧
Go.

340
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:21,590
内幕信息
Inside story,

341
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:24,700
之前没被发现的重大杀人案
previously unknown felony homicide.

342
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:28,770
事关阿尔布开克一位著名的律师
It concerns a prominent Albuquerque attorney

343
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:30,700
他失踪了
who, uh, disappeared,

344
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:33,460
据信是自杀了
believed to have killed himself.

345
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:34,620
霍华德·哈姆林
Howard Hamlin?

346
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:36,550
你说的是霍华德·哈姆林
You're talking about Howard Hamlin.

347
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:37,790
这就是你的"甜头"
That's your "Sweetener"?

348
00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:41,310
他想用哈姆林的事说服我们
He's trying to sell us the Hamlin thing.

349
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,630
他还以为自己真有筹码
He thought he really had something.

350
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:48,980
听起来你和你前妻不常聊天啊
Sounds like you and your ex aren't talking on a regular basis.

351
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,390
金·韦克斯勒上个月走进阿尔布开克地检办公室
Kim Wexler walked into the Albuquerque DA's office last month.

352
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:57,150
她把霍华德·哈姆林的事全公开交代出来了
She spilled her guts about Howard Hamlin, on the record.

353
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,430
你没有筹码了
You got nothing left to sell.

354
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:01,980
最后一次机会
Last chance.

355
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:05,410
上庭受审还是接受认罪协议
Do we go to trial, or do we have a deal?

356
00:27:07,050 --> 00:27:08,000
好
Yes!

357
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:09,870
我们接受
Yes, we have a deal.

358
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:11,630
把协议写下来
Let's get this in writing.

359
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:13,750
一个字也不能改
Not a word changes.

360
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:48,490
当然了
Of course.

361
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:05,810
我要是问你在干嘛  我会不会后悔
Am I gonna be sorry if I ask what's going on?

362
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:08,210
我要让这个停下来
I'm putting a stop to it.

363
00:28:08,610 --> 00:28:09,830
让什么停下来
A stop to what?

364
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:12,580
你还问
To what?

365
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:16,540
你听  别说话  仔细听
Listen. Just-- No. Just listen.

366
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:22,030
这咔哒声
That click?

367
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:23,040
就是这咔哒声
The click.

368
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:26,950
火能打着
The flame is lighting

369
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:29,140
但是不断熄灭
and then it keeps going out.

370
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:34,550
所以要么是热电偶腐蚀了
So it's either a thermocouple that's corroded

371
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:35,970
要么是短路了
or we have a short.

372
00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:40,270
热电偶腐蚀  好  我知道了
A thermocouple is corroded. Okay. I got it.

373
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:42,720
也许我们可以拔掉电源插头
Hey, uh, maybe we could just unplug it?

374
00:28:42,910 --> 00:28:44,840
-或是剪断电线  -不  听好了
- Or cut a wire or something? - No. Listen.

375
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:50,270
我没理由待在地底下  没有热水用
I see no reason to stay down here without hot water

376
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:53,440
明明我轻易就能修好它
when it's something that I can easily fix.

377
00:28:54,690 --> 00:28:56,760
这个应该能行
I think this will do the trick.

378
00:28:58,050 --> 00:29:00,550
你那些行李袋里有没有小折刀
You wouldn't happen to have a pocket knife or a screwdriver

379
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:02,100
或螺丝刀
in one of those bags, would you?

380
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:03,180
没有
No.

381
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:04,990
什么  大声点
What? Speak up!

382
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:06,580
没有
No.

383
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:19,390
加把劲啊
Come on!

384
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:21,260
好了
There we go.

385
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:32,020
这个应该管用
Yeah. This should work.

386
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:50,810
你是科学家  对吧
Hey, you're a scientist, right?

387
00:29:50,810 --> 00:29:52,460
我想问个问题
So, uh, I have a question.

388
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:55,130
如果你有时光机  你会怎么做
What would you do if you had a time machine?

389
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:58,630
时光机
A time machine?

390
00:29:59,850 --> 00:30:00,830
是的
Yeah, um...

391
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:03,840
从科学家的角度来看
From a scientist's point of view.

392
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,650
你可以回到过去  或是前往未来
You can go backwards, forwards.

393
00:30:05,890 --> 00:30:06,820
你会去哪里
Uh, where would you go?

394
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,890
这问题毫无意义
A meaningless question.

395
00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:10,860
还时...
Time--

396
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:12,320
时光机呢
A time machine.

397
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:15,090
听着  时间旅行
Look, time travel,

398
00:30:15,090 --> 00:30:17,400
你在想的这种时间旅行
the kind of time travel that you're thinking of,

399
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,600
从科学上来讲是不可能的
is a scientific impossibility.

400
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,580
那会违反热力学第二定律
It would violate the Second Law of Thermodynamics.

401
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:24,780
那虫洞呢
Uh, but what about a wormhole?

402
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:27,870
我之前看科学节目时  男星艾伦·阿尔达认为...
Well, I was watching NOVA, and Alan Alda seemed to think--

403
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:30,760
那艾伦·阿尔达就是专家咯
Oh, well, then Alan Alda, he's the expert.

404
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:32,970
老天  开什么玩笑
Oh, Christ. Are you kidding me?

405
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:36,650
量子力学  我们现在讨论起这个吗
Quantum mechanics? We're discussing that now?

406
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,560
少管闲事
Stay in your lane.

407
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:46,490
就是个思想实验
It's just a thought experiment.

408
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:48,980
如果可以做到  你一定有什么事
There's gotta be something you'd go back and change

409
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:50,020
是想回去改变的吧
if you could.

410
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:59,110
你不是在说时光机
Oh, you are not talking about a time machine,

411
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:02,560
那在现实中和理论上都是不可能的
which is both a real and theoretical impossibility.

412
00:31:03,290 --> 00:31:05,320
你是在谈论后悔
You are talking about regrets.

413
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:08,610
如果你想问我有没有后悔的事
So if you want to ask about regrets,

414
00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:11,440
那就直接问
just ask about regrets

415
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:14,860
不要扯时间旅行那些鬼话
and leave all this time-traveling nonsense out of it.

416
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:16,500
好  那就说后悔事
Okay. Regrets, then.

417
00:31:20,610 --> 00:31:21,590
后悔事
Regrets.

418
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:23,560
对
Yeah.

419
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:28,800
让我后悔的事
My regrets. All right, well...

420
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,600
让我后悔的事
My regrets...

421
00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:52,010
那个
Well...

422
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:02,950
我读研究生的时候
When I was a graduate student,

423
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:05,450
我创立了一家公司  和几个...
I started a company with some...

424
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:10,110
我当时视为朋友的人
At the time, I thought they were my friends.

425
00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:16,710
我们的目标是将我的研究成果商业化
Our goal was to commercialize discoveries that I had made.

426
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:21,880
到了某个阶段
And at a certain point...

427
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:25,800
我退出了
I stepped away.

428
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,450
我以为这是绅士之举
I thought I was doing the gentlemanly thing.

429
00:32:29,850 --> 00:32:31,430
但我没想到
But little did I understand

430
00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:34,550
是他们精心操纵我
that they were artfully maneuvering me

431
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:36,920
让我抛下了我的创作
into leaving my own creation.

432
00:32:40,330 --> 00:32:41,800
要是我当初留下来了
And had I stayed, oh...

433
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,430
那么
Well...

434
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,570
我现在就不会和你一起被困在地下
I wouldn't be down here with you.

435
00:32:50,810 --> 00:32:53,940
你创立了一家公司  它还在吗
So you started a company. Is it still around?

436
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:56,880
在
Oh, yes.

437
00:32:57,980 --> 00:32:59,800
成功吗
Is it successful?

438
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,390
非常成功
Very.

439
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:05,470
你怎么从来没跟我说过
How could you never tell me about this?

440
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:07,600
我们本可以采取些行动的
We could have done something with this.

441
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:10,980
告他们不当解雇  盗窃知识产权
Wrongful termination, intellectual property theft,

442
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:11,950
专利诈骗
uh, patent fraud.

443
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:14,460
我可以拿这个案子大做文章的
I mean, I coulda sunk my teeth into this!

444
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:19,310
我要找律师也绝对不会找你
You'd have been the last lawyer I'd have gone to.

445
00:33:21,010 --> 00:33:22,420
那倒是
Yeah. Sure.

446
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,580
你呢
So, what about you?

447
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,060
-什么  -后悔事
- What? - Regrets?

448
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:37,180
等等  我想到一件
Y-- Wait. I got one.

449
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:44,180
算了  当我没问
You know what? Never mind.

450
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,460
我20岁那年
When I was 20--

451
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,170
是22岁
um, 22,

452
00:33:47,170 --> 00:33:49,770
我在百货商店门外想假摔碰瓷
I pulled a slip and fall outside Marshall Field's.

453
00:33:49,770 --> 00:33:50,710
真的
I did.

454
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:54,050
我那时年少无脑  就想卖弄
And I was stupid and young and I was trying to show off.

455
00:33:54,050 --> 00:33:56,050
所以我以最快速度砸向冰面
So I hit the ice as fast as I could.

456
00:33:56,050 --> 00:33:58,460
我摔得那么狠  听见一声脆响
I biffed it so hard, I heard a crack!

457
00:33:59,410 --> 00:34:01,550
不是冰碎了  而是我
Wasn't the ice, it was me.

458
00:34:02,490 --> 00:34:04,560
我伤到了自己
I actually hurt myself.

459
00:34:04,770 --> 00:34:07,880
从那以后我的膝盖就落下毛病了
I mean, I-- My knee has never been the same.

460
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:11,550
"碰瓷"
"A slip and fall"?

461
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:15,440
对  我上调酒学校的学费就是这样挣出来的
Yeah. That's how I put myself through bartending school.

462
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:19,130
嗯
Right.

463
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,470
这么说...
So...

464
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:31,900
你一直爱搞歪门邪道
So you were always like this.

465
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:27,830
不好意思
Sorry.

466
00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:35,490
比尔
Bill! Hey.

467
00:35:35,830 --> 00:35:38,750
-我正要...  -先生  这个人是联邦囚犯
- I'm just going to-- - Sir, this man is a federal prisoner.

468
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:40,450
我是法警
I'm a US Marshal.

469
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,520
请你不要跟他说话
I ask you not to speak to him.

470
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:44,580
他是我的律师
That's my lawyer.

471
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:48,100
是吗  你是他的律师
Is that true? You're his lawyer?

472
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:49,610
是的
Yes.

473
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:51,930
以后你会有机会跟你委托人说话的
You'll have other opportunities to talk to your client.

474
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:53,150
请你不要挡着过道
Please move out of the aisle.

475
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:54,060
不  等等
No, hold on.

476
00:35:54,330 --> 00:35:57,570
我当着你面说的话都不是保密的  对吧
N-Nothing I say in front of you is privileged, right?

477
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,180
是的
That's right.

478
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,760
所以如果我跟我律师说话的时候
So if I talk to my attorney and we let something slip

479
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,420
无意中泄露了对检方有利的信息
that could help the government's case,

480
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:05,350
你可以给公诉人传话
you could pass it along to the prosecution.

481
00:36:05,350 --> 00:36:06,340
完全没问题
Totally clean.

482
00:36:06,970 --> 00:36:08,020
没错
Correct.

483
00:36:09,370 --> 00:36:12,390
这样的话  我们真的不能说两句吗
With that in mind, you're sure we can't have a few words?

484
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:20,320
长话短说
Make it fast.

485
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:24,840
她认罪了  地检打算怎么做
She confessed. What's the DA gonna do with it?

486
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:27,940
没有证人  没有确凿证据
No witnesses, no physical evidence.

487
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:31,410
要我猜的话  他们很可能就把这案子晾在一旁
If I had to guess, most likely they sit on it.

488
00:36:31,410 --> 00:36:32,420
永久地晾在一旁
Permanently.

489
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:35,490
好
Okay.

490
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:38,580
不  不"好"
No, not "Okay."

491
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,610
对她来说不好  她的问题不在于地检
Not for her. Her problem's not the DA.

492
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:41,480
那是什么
What then?

493
00:36:41,770 --> 00:36:45,820
金把她的宣誓公证证词
Well, apparently, Kim took her sworn and notarized statement

494
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:47,960
亲手交给了哈姆林的遗孀
and hand delivered it to Hamlin's widow.

495
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,790
-不是吧  -就是
- No. - Yes.

496
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:52,070
她自愿接受民事诉讼
She opened herself up to a civil suit.

497
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:54,240
哈姆林的遗孀可以拿走她现在和以后
The widow can take her for everything she has

498
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:57,410
所拥有的一切  永远如此
and everything she's gonna have, in perpetuity.

499
00:36:57,410 --> 00:36:59,380
那她会起诉吗
So, is she? Suing?

500
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,810
有一件事我可以肯定地告诉你
Look, all I can tell you for sure

501
00:37:02,810 --> 00:37:06,590
我们说话这会儿  哈姆林太太正在四处召集律师
is that Mrs. Hamlin's out lawyer shopping as we speak.

502
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:08,920
虽然她是没找我啦
Not that she bothered to call me.

503
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:15,940
我现在可以去厕所了吗
Hey, can I, uh, go to the john now?

504
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:19,220
我去了
I'm going.

505
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:48,640
等一下  比尔
Hold up, Bill.

506
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:50,620
等等  你肯定想听这个
No, wait. You're gonna love this.

507
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:53,340
哈姆林的事  检方只是一知半解
The Hamlin thing? The government doesn't know the half of it.

508
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:54,770
我们一落地
As soon as we land,

509
00:37:54,770 --> 00:37:55,970
你就告诉他们
I want you to tell the other side

510
00:37:55,970 --> 00:37:57,760
我还有谈判筹码  明白吗
that I've got more to trade, okay?

511
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:00,750
我刚想起来一些能让他们兴奋的事
I j-just remembered something that'll make their toes curl.

512
00:38:01,790 --> 00:38:02,710
好
Okay.

513
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:07,090
能让他们兴奋的事肯定对金不利
Anything that makes their "Toes curl" is bound to jam Kim up.

514
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:08,740
如果与她有关的话
If it involves her.

515
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,610
与她有关
Oh, it involves her.

516
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:13,810
金已经面临民事诉讼了
Kim's already got a civil suit hanging over her head.

517
00:38:13,810 --> 00:38:15,300
你再向检方透露猛料
You give the government more,

518
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,550
她可能会受到重罚
maybe they bring the hammer down.

519
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:21,300
你还能得到什么好处
What more are you gonna get?

520
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:22,490
还剩下什么
What's left?

521
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:24,430
你不明白
You don't understand.

522
00:38:24,430 --> 00:38:26,350
那冰激凌真的很好吃
It's really good ice cream.

523
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:53,050
-又是男孩吗  -这次是女孩
- Boys again? - Girls this time.

524
00:38:53,050 --> 00:38:55,060
她接下来一两年别想睡觉了
Well, she's not sleeping for a year or two.

525
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:57,180
-一两年都算少说  -她还回来吗
- At least. - Is she coming back?

526
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:58,230
她不得不回来
She'll have to.

527
00:38:58,770 --> 00:39:00,020
乔什是双胞胎  对吧
Josh is a twin, isn't he?

528
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:02,340
对  他下周过生日
Oh, yeah. And it's his birthday next week.

529
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,250
我总是带他出门庆祝  就我俩
I always take him out, just the two of us,

530
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:06,080
因为他小时候什么都得和他的双胞胎兄弟分享
because, you know, he had to share everything.

531
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:06,840
那真好
Well, that's nice.

532
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,100
要么去红龙虾餐厅
It's either Red Lobster

533
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:11,020
要么就去威克姆那边新开的中东菜餐厅
or that new Middle Eastern place, the one over on Wickham.

534
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:12,950
-叫托普什么什么  -托普卡皮
- Top something? - Topkapi.

535
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:14,560
没错  托普卡皮
That's it. Topkapi.

536
00:39:14,690 --> 00:39:17,410
格伦带你去过  对吧  那家怎么样
Glen took you there, didn't he? What'd you guys think?

537
00:39:19,450 --> 00:39:20,480
那里不...
Uh, it wasn't...

538
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,270
不太好  是吗
Not good, huh?

539
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:25,300
不  挺好的
No, uh... No. It was fine.

540
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:26,540
乔什会喜欢吗
Would Josh like it?

541
00:39:29,390 --> 00:39:30,820
可能吧
He-- He might.

542
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,360
好  那就再在红龙虾过生日
Okay. Another birthday at Red Lobster.

543
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,740
他不会有意见
He can live with that.

544
00:39:35,310 --> 00:39:38,050
送礼聚会的时候我们送他们什么来着  婴儿车吧
What did we get them for the shower? A stroller, right?

545
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:40,710
是的  带减震器的高级货
Yeah, one of the nice ones with the shock absorbers.

546
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:43,560
双胞胎的话他们可能需要双人婴儿车
With twins? They might need a double stroller...

547
00:40:07,570 --> 00:40:08,580
你也是  多尼
You, too, Donny.

548
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:14,700
席安娜  锯齿草球场的多尼找你  四号线
Seana, Donny from TPC Sawgrass, line four.

549
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:15,330
{\an8}从1978年开始浇灌你的世界

550
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:18,180
谭美  我早走一会儿  你帮我告诉里卡多好吗
Hey, Tammy. I'm leaving early. Can you let Ricardo know?

551
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:20,070
-好  没问题  -谢谢
- Sure. No prob. - Thanks.

552
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:22,520
棕榈海岸洒水器
Palm Coast Sprinkler.

553
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,860
从1978年开始浇灌你的世界
Watering your world since 1978.

554
00:41:40,570 --> 00:41:42,990
如果他出现  你千万别开门
If he shows up, you keep that door locked.

555
00:41:42,990 --> 00:41:45,280
报警  然后给我打电话
You call the police, and then you call me.

556
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:47,160
任何时候都行  不管白天晚上
Any time, day or night.

557
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:47,940
明白吗

卡斯特拉诺先生  烦请移步至话筒前

And for these offenses,

631
00:48:03,830 --> 00:48:08,740
检方给出的量刑建议却只有七年
the government's sentencing recommendation is seven years.

632
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:09,420
法官大人
Your Honor,

633
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:11,190
我可以保证  我和同事们

638
00:48:18,350 --> 00:48:20,210

639
00:48:20,210 --> 00:48:21,120
法官大人
Your Honor?

640
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:23,960
奥克利先生  请建议你的委托人

645
00:48:34,290 --> 00:48:36,030
请允许我发言  
fully understand the situation?

646
00:48:36,260 --> 00:48:39,110
古德曼先生  你是受惠者
Mr. Goodman, you are the beneficiary

647
00:48:39,110 --> 00:48:41,720
我担任法官22年来
of the most generous sentencing recommendation

648
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:44,210
都没见过如此慷慨的量刑建议
I've seen in 22 years on the bench.

649
00:48:44,210 --> 00:48:47,730
你所做的任何陈述只会危及该建议
Any statement you make imperils that recommendation.

650
00:48:47,730 --> 00:48:49,270
我非常清楚  法官大人
I'm very aware of that, Your Honor.

651
00:48:49,850 --> 00:48:51,390
如果您允许我发言
Uh, if you'll allow me to speak,

652
00:48:51,390 --> 00:48:55,070
我觉得可以为本法庭节省宝贵的时间
I-- I think I can save the court's valuable time.

653
00:48:58,140 --> 00:48:59,190
请讲
Go ahead.

654
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:00,750
长话短说
Briefly.

655
00:49:15,470 --> 00:49:18,310
两年前  一个男人走进我的办公室
Two years ago a man came into my office.

656
00:49:18,310 --> 00:49:20,580
他说他叫梅修
He said his name was Mayhew.

657
00:49:21,410 --> 00:49:25,500
他要我的一位委托人替他做伪证
He wanted one of my clients to lie for him under oath.

658
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:29,350
他给我钱  我拒绝了
He offered me money. I refused.

659
00:49:30,130 --> 00:49:33,910
那一晚  我离开办公室时  遭到了袭击
That night, as I was leaving my office, I was attacked.

660
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:37,030
我的头被套上了一个麻袋
A bag was shoved over my head,

661
00:49:37,030 --> 00:49:38,180
我被五花大绑
I was hogtied,

662
00:49:38,180 --> 00:49:40,280
载到了沙漠里
I was driven out into the desert.

663
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:41,930
他们摘下麻袋后
And when they pulled the hood off,

664
00:49:41,930 --> 00:49:43,740
我发现自己跪在一座挖好的坟墓前
I was kneeling in front of an open grave

665
00:49:43,740 --> 00:49:45,930
被抢指着头
with a gun pointed at my head.

666
00:49:46,770 --> 00:49:49,970
那就是我对沃尔特·怀特的最初印象
That was my introduction to Walter White!

667
00:49:51,690 --> 00:49:53,310
我当时害怕极了
I was terrified.

668
00:49:58,830 --> 00:50:00,100
但是很快就不怕了
But not for long.

669
00:50:03,180 --> 00:50:05,230
那一晚  我看见了机遇
That night, I saw opportunity.

670
00:50:06,550 --> 00:50:08,390
一个赚大钱的机遇
A shot at big money.

671
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:11,730
我就紧紧地抓住了它
And I grabbed it and I held it tight.

672
00:50:11,730 --> 00:50:13,890
在后来的十六个月里
And for the next 16 months,

673
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:16,580
我的每个清醒时刻
my every waking moment was

674
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:19,360
都用来打造沃尔特·怀特的毒品帝国
spent building Walter White's drug empire.

675
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:21,740
等等  古德曼先生  打住
Hold on, Mr. Goodman. Stop right there.

676
00:50:22,670 --> 00:50:25,380
你先咨询完奥克利先生再说话
Consult Mr. Oakley before you say another word.

677
00:50:25,380 --> 00:50:28,400
法官大人  我认为应当在法庭说出真相
Your Honor, I believe the court deserves the whole truth.

678
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:31,060
你这番话  跟你在认罪协议里
You are contradicting your plea agreement's

679
00:50:31,060 --> 00:50:33,040
宣誓证明过的事实依据自相矛盾
sworn factual basis.

680
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:34,810
恕我直言  法官大人
No offense, Your Honor, but I--

681
00:50:34,810 --> 00:50:36,790
这方面的法律我比您更清楚
I think I know the law here better than you do.

682
00:50:36,790 --> 00:50:38,950
法官大人  我们申请休庭
Your Honor, we'd like to request a recess.

683
00:50:38,950 --> 00:50:40,710
不  我们不需要休庭
No, we do not need a recess.

684
00:50:40,710 --> 00:50:43,630
法官大人  我们对古德曼先生继续发言没意见
Your Honor, we are satisfied for Mr. Goodman to continue.

685
00:50:43,730 --> 00:50:44,620
法官大人
Your Honor,

686
00:50:44,980 --> 00:50:47,290
我请求退出此案
I'd like to petition to withdraw from this case.

687
00:50:47,290 --> 00:50:49,680
-驳回  -我很恳切...
- Denied. - Respectfully--

688
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:51,130
不可能
Not a chance.

689
00:50:54,380 --> 00:50:56,260
鲍比  给古德曼先生宣誓
Bobbi, swear Mr. Goodman in.

690
00:51:00,940 --> 00:51:02,380
你愿发誓在法庭上
Do you swear that the evidence

691
00:51:02,380 --> 00:51:04,530
就此事给出的证据
you shall give to the court in this matter

692
00:51:04,670 --> 00:51:06,300
字字属实
shall be the truth, the whole truth,

693
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:08,260
绝无虚言  愿主佑你吗
and nothing but the truth so help you God?

694
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:09,530
我发誓
I do.

695
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:12,820
古德曼先生  你现在发过誓了
Mr. Goodman, you are now under oath.

696
00:51:14,100 --> 00:51:16,160
你的任何虚假证词
Any false statement you make

697
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:17,530
都可能用于起诉你
can be used in prosecution

698
00:51:17,530 --> 00:51:20,340
作伪证和妨碍司法
for perjury or obstruction of justice.

699
00:51:20,340 --> 00:51:21,420
你明白吗
Do you understand?

700
00:51:21,590 --> 00:51:24,050
-明白  -好的
- Yes. - All right.

701
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:25,680
在过去的二十四小时内
In the last 24 hours,

702
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:27,910
你有摄入任何酒精或是毒品吗
have you used any alcohol or other drugs?

703
00:51:27,910 --> 00:51:28,940
没有  法官大人
No, Your Honor.

704
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,330
你有服用任何处方药物吗
Are you taking any prescription medications?

705
00:51:31,330 --> 00:51:32,270
没有
No.

706
00:51:32,940 --> 00:51:33,990
好
All right.

707
00:51:35,370 --> 00:51:36,390
请继续
Continue.

708
00:51:46,210 --> 00:51:49,980
关于金·韦克斯勒  我向检方撒了谎
Oh, um, I lied to the government about, uh, Kim Wexler.

709
00:51:51,660 --> 00:51:53,260
我跟他们说了一堆
Uh, I fed them a load of BS

710
00:51:53,260 --> 00:51:55,880
她卷入了霍华德·哈姆林谋杀案的胡话
about her involvement in Howard Hamlin's murder.

711
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:58,910
我这么做是想让她今天能来
I just-- I just wanted her to come here today.

712
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:00,500
我想让她听我说
I wanted her to hear this.

713
00:52:04,990 --> 00:52:07,400
没错  制冰毒的时候我不在场
So, yeah, I wasn't there when the meth was cooked.

714
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:09,220
销售的时候我不在场
I wasn't there when it was sold.

715
00:52:09,380 --> 00:52:11,080
任何一起谋杀发生时我都不在场
I didn't witness any of the murders,

716
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:13,350
但我很清楚地知道发生了这些事
but I damn well knew it was happening.

717
00:52:13,350 --> 00:52:15,970
我不仅仅自愿参与其中
I was more than a willing participant.

718
00:52:15,970 --> 00:52:17,770
我更是不可或缺的一分子
I was indispensable.

719
00:52:17,770 --> 00:52:19,760
我保沃尔特·怀特不进监狱
I kept Walter White out of jail,

720
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:20,920
我帮他洗钱
I laundered his money,

721
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:23,690
我替他撒谎  给他出谋划策
I lied for him, I conspired with him,

722
00:52:23,690 --> 00:52:25,950
我赚得盆满钵满
and I made millions.

723
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:29,590
如果他那天没有走进我的办公室
If he hadn't walked into my office that day,

724
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:32,380
沃尔特·怀特不出一个月就会
Walter White would have been dead

725
00:52:32,590 --> 00:52:35,180
要么死翘翘  要么蹲大牢
or behind bars within a month.

726
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:40,880
而施罗德探员和戈麦斯探员
And Agent Schrader and Agent Gomez

727
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:44,440
以及其他许多人也不会死去
and a whole lot of other people would still be alive.

728
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:50,910
事实就是  沃尔特·怀特没了我就不可能成功
Fact is, Walter White couldn't have done it without me.

729
00:52:53,580 --> 00:52:54,690
记好了吗
You got that?

730
00:52:56,150 --> 00:52:58,870
法官大人  我们请求删去古德曼先生的发言
Your Honor, we move to strike Mr. Goodman's comments.

731
00:52:58,870 --> 00:53:00,010
基于何种理由
On what grounds?

732
00:53:00,030 --> 00:53:02,250
-这是推测  -推测
- Um, speculation. - Speculation?

733
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:04,390
他在为自己的行为作证
He's testifying to his own actions.

734
00:53:04,390 --> 00:53:07,040
法官大人  他描述的都是
Your Honor, uh, he's describing events

735
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:09,120
在假设他做法不同的前提下才会发生的事
that would have transpired had he acted differently.

736
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:10,390
我还有一件事要说
I have one more thing to say.

737
00:53:10,390 --> 00:53:13,570
-坐下  古德曼先生  马上  -拜托了  法官大人
- Sit down, Mr. Goodman. Now. - Please, your Honor. Please.

738
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:17,140
{\an8}请法警带古德曼先生回原位
Will Marshal please remove Mr. Goodman from the podium.

739
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:17,260
检方敦促本庭允许古德曼先生继续发言
The government urges the court to allow Mr. Goodman to continue.

740
00:53:17,260 --> 00:53:18,900
这怎么不是推测呢
How is that not speculation?

741
00:53:24,930 --> 00:53:26,340
那好吧  古德曼先生
All right, Mr. Goodman.

742
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:27,970
你继续
Go ahead.

743
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:35,830
霍华德·哈姆林的遭遇...
What happened to Howard Hamlin was...

744
00:53:37,130 --> 00:53:38,100
实在是...
it was...

745
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:42,570
我没办法说出口...
I can't even...

746
00:53:47,580 --> 00:53:48,680
在那之后
After that,

747
00:53:50,450 --> 00:53:53,170
金有勇气重新来过
Kim had the guts to start over.

748
00:53:53,330 --> 00:53:55,660
她远走高飞了  但其实...
She left town, but...

749
00:53:58,060 --> 00:53:59,790
我才是真正逃避的那个人
I'm the one who ran away.

750
00:54:04,790 --> 00:54:06,510
至于我的哥哥查克
And my brother Chuck--

751
00:54:08,410 --> 00:54:09,720
查尔斯·麦吉尔
Uh, Charles McGill.

752
00:54:10,590 --> 00:54:11,890
您可能知道他
Y-You may have known him.

753
00:54:15,020 --> 00:54:17,970
他是位了不起的律师
He was an incredible lawyer, as--

754
00:54:18,410 --> 00:54:20,190
我见过的最厉害的人
The most brilliant guy I ever met.

755
00:54:20,190 --> 00:54:21,700
但他也有局限
But he was limited.

756
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:24,110
我尽力了
I tried.

757
00:54:25,690 --> 00:54:27,450
我本可以更努力的
I could have tried harder.

758
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:30,840
我应该更努力一点的
I should have.

759
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:35,410
-然而...  -法官大人
- Instead, when-- - Your Honor.

760
00:54:35,410 --> 00:54:38,440
比尔  拜托  让我说完吧
Bill, please. Just let me get through this.

761
00:54:39,710 --> 00:54:43,920
然而  我发现有机会伤害他时  我行动了
Instead, when I saw a chance to hurt him, I took it.

762
00:54:47,770 --> 00:54:51,550
我害他丢了职业过失保险
I got his malpractice insurance canceled.

763
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:54,200
我夺走了他活下去的唯一指望
I took away the one thing he lived for,

764
00:54:54,470 --> 00:54:55,490
法律
the law.

765
00:54:58,520 --> 00:55:00,460
之后他自杀了
After that, he killed himself.

766
00:55:07,540 --> 00:55:09,030
而我得背负着歉疚苟活
And I'll live with that.

767
00:55:19,950 --> 00:55:21,420
你这是干什么
What was all that?

768
00:55:21,750 --> 00:55:24,320
你哥哥的事  根本就不是犯罪啊
That thing with your brother, that wasn't even a crime.

769
00:55:24,990 --> 00:55:25,840
是犯罪
Yeah, it was.

770
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:30,620
古德曼先生  坐好了别动
Mr. Goodman, sit down and stay seated.

771
00:55:30,850 --> 00:55:32,060
是麦吉尔
The name's McGill.

772
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:34,430
我叫詹姆斯·麦吉尔
I'm James McGill.

773
00:55:36,790 --> 00:55:39,280
法官大人  鉴于被告的供词
Your Honor, in view of the defendant's confession,

774
00:55:38,110 --> 00:55:39,700
{\an8}法官大人  我们想申请休庭
Your Honor, we'd like to request a recess--

775
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:41,320
检方在此撤回量刑建议
the Government withdraws its sentencing recommendation.

776
00:55:39,700 --> 00:55:41,070
{\an8}不  等一下
No. No, hold on.

777
00:55:41,070 --> 00:55:42,740
{\an8}那不是供词
That was not a confession.

778
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:43,990
并敦促本庭对每项罪名
And urges this court to impose the statutory maximum

779
00:55:42,740 --> 00:55:44,950
{\an8}他说的...他说的不是供词
That was... That was not a confession.

780
00:55:43,990 --> 00:55:45,430
判处法定最高年限的监禁期
for each of these offenses.

781
00:55:44,950 --> 00:55:47,290
{\an8}那只不过是以复杂的叙述方式...
It was merely, uh, a single point of view...

782
00:55:45,430 --> 00:55:46,510
此外  法官大人
Furthermore, your Honor,

783
00:55:46,510 --> 00:55:48,150
需要举行第二次额外听证会
a second additional hearing is required...

784
00:55:47,290 --> 00:55:51,900
{\an8}所表达的一种观点
in a very complex, uh, narrative.

785
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:54,300
{\an8}请容我补充  该观点
A point of view, I might add, that is presented without

786
00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:56,500
{\an8}没有任何证据支持
a single shred of evidence.

787
00:55:48,150 --> 00:55:51,270
以评估古德曼先生...
to assess the additional claims Mr. Goodman--

788
00:55:51,270 --> 00:55:54,140
抱歉  是麦吉尔先生现在承认的额外罪名
I'm sorry-- Mr. McGill has now admitted to,

789
00:55:54,140 --> 00:55:56,370
包括在本庭作伪证  法官大人
including perjury on this court, your Honor.

790
00:56:04,060 --> 00:56:05,070
你放电了吗
Did you ground yourself?

791
00:56:05,070 --> 00:56:06,120
放了
Yes, I did!

792
00:56:07,980 --> 00:56:08,870
该死
Oh, crap!

793
00:56:20,110 --> 00:56:21,690
我都开始担心了
I was starting to worry.

794
00:56:21,820 --> 00:56:23,820
我的车在四十号公路上抛锚了
My car conked out on the 40.

795
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:26,510
我差点被一辆水泥车压扁
I almost got creamed by a cement truck.

796
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:37,410
他们有卖你喜欢的那种苹果
They had those apples that you like.

797
00:56:37,930 --> 00:56:40,190
我帮你买了半打富士
I got you half a dozen Fuji.

798
00:56:41,530 --> 00:56:43,800
中央大街的报摊小贩说
Um, and the newsstand on Central

799
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:46,530
他们可能要卖《金融时报》了
said they might start carrying the Financial Times.

800
00:56:46,530 --> 00:56:47,930
好消息  是不是
So that's good, right?

801
00:57:01,450 --> 00:57:02,370
怎么了
What?

802
00:57:02,580 --> 00:57:04,750
你知道我可以雇人来做这些事的
You know I could hire someone to do this.

803
00:57:04,750 --> 00:57:06,850
我可以从办公室里找个人
I could get someone from the office.

804
00:57:07,580 --> 00:57:08,740
我来做就行
I'm doing it.

805
00:57:08,770 --> 00:57:09,910
每天吗
Yeah, every day?

806
00:57:10,390 --> 00:57:13,130
你不是打算开一间律师事务所
While you're trying to start a...practice?

807
00:57:13,620 --> 00:57:14,590
为什么
Why?

808
00:57:14,660 --> 00:57:15,620
还用问吗
Why?

809
00:57:17,110 --> 00:57:18,300
因为你是我哥哥
'Cause you're my brother.

810
00:57:19,550 --> 00:57:20,890
你也会为我这么做的
You'd do the same for me.

811
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:26,250
好吧  你可以在这待一会
Mm. Well, you could stay for a while.

812
00:57:26,250 --> 00:57:27,260
我们可以聊聊
We could talk.

813
00:57:28,060 --> 00:57:29,720
聊聊  聊什么
Talk? What about?

814
00:57:31,830 --> 00:57:34,210
你的案子  你的委托人
Well, your cases. Your clients.

815
00:57:34,530 --> 00:57:36,490
你想聊我的委托人
You want to talk about my clients?

816
00:57:37,170 --> 00:57:39,020
真的吗  你想聊
Seriously? You want to talk about, uh,

817
00:57:39,410 --> 00:57:41,980
在基督教科学阅览室里拉客
the granny who got picked up for soliciting

818
00:57:41,980 --> 00:57:44,010
而被抓的老太太
inside a Christian Science Reading Room?

819
00:57:44,690 --> 00:57:47,510
还是闯进酒铺
Wh-- What about the kid who broke into a liquor store

820
00:57:47,510 --> 00:57:50,110
喝了五瓶薄荷甜酒
and drank five bottles of creme de menthe

821
00:57:50,110 --> 00:57:51,510
然后昏倒在柜台后面的小子
and then passed out behind the counter?

822
00:57:51,510 --> 00:57:53,560
他们理应得到有力的辩护
They deserve a vigorous defense.

823
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:55,020
跟其他委托人一样
Like any other client.

824
00:57:56,570 --> 00:57:59,080
或者你只是想告诉我我哪里做错了
Or maybe you just wanna tell me what I'm doing wrong.

825
00:57:59,460 --> 00:58:01,070
我没有这么想
That's not what I had in mind.

826
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:16,360
我希望这冰不是你从汽车旅馆的制冰机偷来的
I'm hoping you didn't steal that from a motel ice machine.

827
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:17,410
没准真不是呢
You can hope.

828
00:58:18,850 --> 00:58:21,870
促膝谈心什么的还是算了吧  查克
I'm gonna take a pass on the heart-to-heart, Chuck.

829
00:58:22,140 --> 00:58:24,660
我其中一个"理应得到我帮助"的委托人
One of my "deserving" clients,

830
00:58:25,490 --> 00:58:29,130
被抓到在工艺品店外面挥舞他的小腊肠
