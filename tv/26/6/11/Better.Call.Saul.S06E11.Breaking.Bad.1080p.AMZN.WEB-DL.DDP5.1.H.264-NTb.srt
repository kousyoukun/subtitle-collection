00:42:32,851 --> 00:42:34,920
Enron, WorldCom...

650
00:42:35,053 --> 00:42:37,022
Madoff and his ilk...

651
00:42:37,155 --> 00:42:38,924
[Gene] Mm.

652
00:42:39,057 --> 00:42:40,735
I gotta believe there's
a special place in Hell

653
00:42:40,759 --> 00:42:41,759
for those people.

654
00:42:41,827 --> 00:42:42,827
Yeah.

655
00:42:43,428 --> 00:42:44,562
[clicks tongue]

656
00:42:44,696 --> 00:42:48,433
But in my experience,
that's the exception.

657
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:53,371
Y-You can't let a few bad
apples spoil it for the rest of us.

658
00:42:53,504 --> 00:42:55,373
- In fact...
- [alarm beeping]

659
00:42:55,506 --> 00:42:56,742
[clears throat] Sorry.

660
00:42:58,910 --> 00:42:59,910
[Saul grunts lightly]

661
00:43:06,184 --> 00:43:07,184
[sighs]

662
00:43:10,521 --> 00:43:11,723
[Saul] Those look exotic.

663
00:43:12,758 --> 00:43:14,425
I-I went through that phase.

664
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:16,427
I took every vitamin there was.

665
00:43:16,561 --> 00:43:19,064
Hey, guess how many pills I took

666
00:43:19,197 --> 00:43:20,441
to try to keep the
hair on my head.

667
00:43:20,465 --> 00:43:21,967
- [chuckles] -
Worked like a charm.

668
00:43:23,301 --> 00:43:24,302
What are those for?

669
00:43:27,005 --> 00:43:28,573
Cancer. [clears throat]

670
00:43:30,942 --> 00:43:32,577
Oh. [clears throat]

671
00:43:32,711 --> 00:43:33,711
Sorry.

672
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:36,380
Uh.

673
00:43:37,916 --> 00:43:41,086
Uh, is it, uh... is it bad?

674
00:43:41,987 --> 00:43:43,147
Well, it ain't the good kind.

675
00:43:45,423 --> 00:43:47,926
Come on. More drinks.
This one's on me.

676
00:43:48,059 --> 00:43:49,099
Get two more here, please?

677
00:43:55,166 --> 00:43:56,486
Hey, uh, it's none
of my business,

678
00:43:56,567 --> 00:43:57,567
but, um...

679
00:43:58,603 --> 00:44:00,105
should you be drinkin'?

680
00:44:06,812 --> 00:44:08,346
You only go around once.

681
00:44:12,417 --> 00:44:13,284
You got that right.

682
00:44:13,418 --> 00:44:14,418
[glasses clink]

683
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:38,476
You sure you don't
want to take this one, Vik?

684
00:44:38,609 --> 00:44:39,644
I can wait.

685
00:44:39,778 --> 00:44:40,946
No. It's all you.

686
00:44:41,079 --> 00:44:42,147
Ah, okay.

687
00:44:47,819 --> 00:44:48,819
[man sighs]

688
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:03,668
[sighs softly]

689
00:45:16,381 --> 00:45:18,850
[headset beeping, vibrating]

690
00:45:18,984 --> 00:45:21,352
[motor whirring]

691
00:45:26,024 --> 00:45:27,425
Feed me, what do we got?

692
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:28,936
[Francesca] <i>You remember
to take your fish oil?</i>

693
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:29,761
- I did. <i>- B-12?</i>

694
00:45:29,895 --> 00:45:31,362
- Did it. <i>- L-arginine?</i>

695
00:45:31,496 --> 00:45:33,231
Got 'em all. Next.

696
00:45:33,364 --> 00:45:35,642
<i>You're supposed to file that
appellate brief for Hemple by 4:00.</i>

697
00:45:35,666 --> 00:45:37,836
Crap. Um, hey,

698
00:45:37,969 --> 00:45:40,839
could you put down the travel
magazine and help with that?

699
00:45:40,972 --> 00:45:42,040
<i>Not a paralegal, Saul.</i>

700
00:45:43,241 --> 00:45:45,310
<i>Anyway, your
12:30 just walked in.</i>

701
00:45:45,443 --> 00:45:46,644
Aces. Send him in.

702
00:45:48,046 --> 00:45:49,948
Oh! Enter, Sunshine.

703
00:45:50,081 --> 00:45:52,583
Cast some light into
my cold, dark world.

704
00:45:52,717 --> 00:45:55,987
["You're a Grand Old
Flag" playing in distance]

705
00:45:56,121 --> 00:45:58,656
[music fades]

706
00:46:04,362 --> 00:46:05,430
[Mike sighs]

707
00:46:09,267 --> 00:46:10,936
Hello? You're on
the clock, right?

708
00:46:11,069 --> 00:46:13,304
So give with the info anytime.

709
00:46:13,438 --> 00:46:14,940
When you're done.

710
00:46:15,073 --> 00:46:16,307
No, I can multitask, please.

711
00:46:18,076 --> 00:46:20,178
I'm not gonna talk to
you while you're on...

712
00:46:20,311 --> 00:46:23,014
whatever that is.

713
00:46:23,148 --> 00:46:25,984
You know, LBJ used to have
his underlings give him reports

714
00:46:26,117 --> 00:46:27,618
while he was on the shitter.

715
00:46:28,719 --> 00:46:30,088
Uh-huh.

716
00:46:30,221 --> 00:46:33,624
Well, either I'm gonna leave,

717
00:46:33,758 --> 00:46:36,261
or I'm gonna put
my foot in your skull.

718
00:46:37,128 --> 00:46:38,163
[Saul sighs]

719
00:46:38,296 --> 00:46:39,430
- [whirring stops]
- Fine.

720
00:46:41,399 --> 00:46:42,968
[grunts]

721
00:46:43,101 --> 00:46:44,602
But you should try one of these.

722
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:45,603
[sighs]

723
00:46:45,736 --> 00:46:47,805
You walk like Frankenstein

after he was probed by aliens.

725
00:46:50,108 --> 00:46:52,310
[chuckles] I can get you one.

726
00:46:52,443 --> 00:46:55,346
It would do
wonders for your chi.

727
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:56,480
[sighs]

728
00:46:59,084 --> 00:47:00,785
Let's go, lay it on me.

729
00:47:03,421 --> 00:47:04,421
[sighs]

730
00:47:05,924 --> 00:47:07,292
All right. First.

731
00:47:08,759 --> 00:47:10,996
There's your Mrs. Denise Gabler.

732
00:47:11,129 --> 00:47:12,297
She's cheating, all right.

733
00:47:14,132 --> 00:47:16,101
[whistles] Limber.

734
00:47:16,234 --> 00:47:17,903
Ha-ha!

735
00:47:18,036 --> 00:47:20,171
Well, at least I know
they didn't spot you.

736
00:47:20,305 --> 00:47:21,572
No one could stay that aroused

737
00:47:21,706 --> 00:47:23,308
with your mug peeking
through the window.

738
00:47:26,111 --> 00:47:27,712
What else you got?

739
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:30,048
Well, next, I followed
your bus driver.

740
00:47:30,181 --> 00:47:32,717
News flash. He really
does have a broken neck.

741
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:35,220
Fantastic. [breathes sharply]

742
00:47:35,353 --> 00:47:37,388
That makes my life much easier.

743
00:47:37,522 --> 00:47:38,689
Keep it coming.

744
00:47:38,823 --> 00:47:40,491
Second story guy
out of Indianapolis.

745
00:47:40,625 --> 00:47:43,361
Lasky. Did a dime at Menard.

746
00:47:43,494 --> 00:47:44,854
Now, if you're
looking for a talent

747
00:47:44,963 --> 00:47:46,864
who'll keep his mouth
shut, you can trust him.

748
00:47:46,998 --> 00:47:49,167
I say he's worth
keeping an eye on.

749
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:51,069
Second story guy,
second story guy.

750
00:47:51,202 --> 00:47:53,538
I got... I got more second
story guys in my book

751
00:47:53,671 --> 00:47:55,706
than pimples at a
Junior prom. [chuckles]

752
00:47:58,309 --> 00:48:01,346
What about, uh,
that Heisenberg fella?

753
00:48:03,381 --> 00:48:05,150
High school chemistry teacher.

754
00:48:06,051 --> 00:48:08,086
You're shittin' me. Really?

755
00:48:08,219 --> 00:48:10,155
Walter Hartwell White.

756
00:48:10,288 --> 00:48:13,058
Chemistry teacher
over at JP Wynne.

757
00:48:13,191 --> 00:48:15,660
Working with a former
student, current meth head,

758
00:48:15,793 --> 00:48:16,861
one Jesse Pinkman.

759
00:48:16,995 --> 00:48:17,995
Wow.

760
00:48:19,064 --> 00:48:21,099
Uh, what else about the teacher?

761
00:48:21,232 --> 00:48:23,234
He has lung cancer.

762
00:48:24,202 --> 00:48:25,270
Jesus.

763
00:48:27,205 --> 00:48:28,974
That's why he can't
quit with the coughing.

764
00:48:30,041 --> 00:48:31,076
How bad?

765
00:48:31,209 --> 00:48:32,910
Stage Three A.

766
00:48:33,044 --> 00:48:34,912
He's in treatment,
more tests to come,

767
00:48:35,046 --> 00:48:36,581
but it doesn't look good.

768
00:48:36,714 --> 00:48:38,474
Now, listen, even if
this guy was gonna live,

769
00:48:38,583 --> 00:48:39,917
I wouldn't go near him.

770
00:48:40,051 --> 00:48:41,386
He's a complete amateur.

771
00:48:41,519 --> 00:48:43,554
Well, you see an amateur.

772
00:48:43,688 --> 00:48:47,592
I see... [breathes sharply] 170
pounds of clay ready to be molded.

773
00:48:47,725 --> 00:48:49,527
Well, if the cancer
doesn't get him,

774
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:51,796
it'll be the cops or
a bullet to the head.

775
00:48:53,698 --> 00:48:55,967
Is that your appraisal
or is that what

776
00:48:56,101 --> 00:48:58,569
"He-Who-Shall-Not-Be-Named"
says about him?

777
00:48:58,703 --> 00:49:01,672
He doesn't say anything.
The guy's small potatoes.

778
00:49:01,806 --> 00:49:03,308
Yeah, okay. I hear you.

779
00:49:03,441 --> 00:49:04,809
I just...

780
00:49:04,942 --> 00:49:06,777
I got a feeling about this.

781
00:49:06,911 --> 00:49:09,447
This Heisenberg
guy's got something.

782
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:12,317
It's top of the line product,
that's the buzz on the street,

783
00:49:12,450 --> 00:49:13,694
and I just think, with
the right management...

784
00:49:13,718 --> 00:49:15,987
You know, years ago,
I bought a Betamax.

785
00:49:16,121 --> 00:49:17,588
Good product. "Top of the line."

786
00:49:17,722 --> 00:49:21,059
Experts said it was
better than a VHS.

787
00:49:21,192 --> 00:49:24,195
Turned out to be a complete
waste of time and money.

788
00:49:24,329 --> 00:49:25,329
Hmm?

789
00:49:25,963 --> 00:49:26,963
Let it go.

790
00:49:29,434 --> 00:49:31,469
[sighs] Guy with that mustache

791
00:49:31,602 --> 00:49:33,538
probably doesn't make
a lot of good life choices.

792
00:49:33,671 --> 00:49:36,641
[chuckles] So, yeah,
uh, the second story guy.

793
00:49:36,774 --> 00:49:39,110
- Uh, Menard, you said?
- Yeah, right, right, right.

794
00:49:40,745 --> 00:49:42,580
All right, part of
a high-end crew

795
00:49:42,713 --> 00:49:44,815
fencing jewelry up into Canada.

796
00:49:46,551 --> 00:49:48,653
Now, the Lasky kid
caught a bad break.

797
00:49:48,786 --> 00:49:51,322
The cop was driving by just
as he was ducking in a window.

798
00:49:52,557 --> 00:49:54,292
He did the time,

799
00:49:54,425 --> 00:49:58,496
no one else on his
crew went down. Solid.

800

00:50:24,755 --> 00:50:26,324
<i>The voyage is not easy.</i>

811
00:50:26,457 --> 00:50:31,096
<i>While traveling, the herd
must stay well fed, rested</i>

812
00:50:31,229 --> 00:50:34,765
<i>and free of disease
or be left behi...</i>

813
00:50:34,899 --> 00:50:37,535
[class instructor] <i>Couple
more. And shuffle, ladies.</i>

814
00:50:39,237 --> 00:50:40,371
<i>Just like that.</i>

815
00:50:42,373 --> 00:50:44,093
- [headset beeping,
vibrating] <i>- Now L step.</i>

816
00:50:46,010 --> 00:50:47,145
<i>Four times.</i>

817
00:50:49,046 --> 00:50:50,815
<i>Fabulous!</i>

818
00:50:50,948 --> 00:50:52,883
<i>Let me see you having fun.</i>

819
00:50:53,017 --> 00:50:54,051
Yeah.

820
00:50:54,185 --> 00:50:55,185
[clears throat]

821
00:50:56,721 --> 00:50:58,089
W... Uh.

822
00:50:58,223 --> 00:50:59,223
What do you mean?

823
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:03,160
He what?

824
00:51:05,830 --> 00:51:09,700
Tell... Tell him to get his ass
back to the garage right now.

825
00:51:09,834 --> 00:51:12,537
[Marion laughs]

826
00:51:14,205 --> 00:51:15,706
You cutie-patootie.

827
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:19,076
[sighs]

828
00:51:19,210 --> 00:51:21,412
You think you've seen
everything. [laughs]

829
00:51:21,546 --> 00:51:23,581
[dog barking in distance]

830
00:51:26,584 --> 00:51:28,719
[woman talking
indistinctly on headphones]

831
00:51:30,755 --> 00:51:32,390
[barking continues]

832
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:44,101
[barking continues]

833
00:51:44,235 --> 00:51:46,971
[Gene] Shut that goddamn
dog up and get back in here.

834
00:51:47,104 --> 00:51:49,274
[Buddy speaking indistinctly]

835
00:51:49,407 --> 00:51:50,708
[vehicle door closes]

836
00:51:50,841 --> 00:51:51,841
[Gene] Get in.

837
00:51:56,247 --> 00:51:59,116
You're kidding me. You're
absolutely kidding me.

838
00:51:59,250 --> 00:52:00,410
I'm sorry, man. I couldn't...

839
00:52:00,451 --> 00:52:02,287
Do you know how much
time, how much effort,

840
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:04,289
I put into finding
the perfect mark?

841
00:52:04,422 --> 00:52:06,090
I have to weed
through all these saps

842
00:52:06,224 --> 00:52:08,693
who have wives
and families at home,

843
00:52:08,826 --> 00:52:10,761
find somebody who's
alone with money,

844
00:52:10,895 --> 00:52:13,498
and, what, so you
can just wimp out?

845
00:52:13,631 --> 00:52:15,031
- The guy has cancer, man.
- [sighs]

846
00:52:15,132 --> 00:52:17,302
I found pills in his pocket.

847
00:52:17,435 --> 00:52:19,170
Okay? The same ones my dad took.

848
00:52:19,304 --> 00:52:20,464
For, like, pancreatic cancer.

849
00:52:20,538 --> 00:52:22,740
So? A guy with cancer
can't be an asshole?

850
00:52:22,873 --> 00:52:25,776
[scoffs] Believe me, I
speak from experience.

851
00:52:25,910 --> 00:52:28,246
I can't rip off a guy
with cancer. I'm sorry.

852
00:52:28,379 --> 00:52:31,182
Do you know how many of the suckers
we've ripped off have sob stories?

853
00:52:31,316 --> 00:52:32,617
Every single one of them.

854
00:52:33,651 --> 00:52:35,119
Besides, it'll be months

855
00:52:35,253 --> 00:52:36,930
before they even realize
they've been taken.

856
00:52:36,954 --> 00:52:38,389
This guy will already be dead.

857
00:52:38,523 --> 00:52:39,833
So, please,
get back in your truck,

858
00:52:39,857 --> 00:52:41,492
go back to the house,
and finish the job.

859
00:52:46,063 --> 00:52:48,633
No, man. I can't do that.

860
00:52:48,766 --> 00:52:49,900
I can't.

861
00:52:50,034 --> 00:52:51,754
[Gene] Look, all right.
[chuckles] I get it.

862
00:52:52,470 --> 00:52:54,171
You get over it, okay?

863
00:52:54,305 --> 00:52:55,773
Please, believe me. Y...

864
00:52:55,906 --> 00:52:58,509
Before you know it,
you forget all about it.

865
00:52:58,643 --> 00:52:59,643
Go.

866
00:53:01,879 --> 00:53:03,881
Well, l-look,
we're doing really well, right?

867
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:05,934
Hear me out, okay?
I mean, we're rolling in cash.

868
00:53:06,684 --> 00:53:08,052
We can just let this one go.

869
00:53:08,185 --> 00:53:09,454
Not your call.

870
00:53:09,587 --> 00:53:13,090
[scoffs] Yeah, but I,
I pulled the tape when I left.

871
00:53:13,224 --> 00:53:14,392
The door's locked.

872
00:53:14,525 --> 00:53:15,869
We couldn't get back in
even if we wanted to.

873
00:53:15,893 --> 00:53:16,893
[grunts]

874
00:53:18,596 --> 00:53:20,965
Jeff, come on, man,
back me up here.

875
00:53:21,999 --> 00:53:23,401
Huh?

876
00:53:23,534 --> 00:53:24,835
Oh, well... I, I don't know.

877
00:53:24,969 --> 00:53:27,838
I mean, I can see
both sides, kinda.

878
00:53:27,972 --> 00:53:29,583
You know, forget it.
You're fired. Just go.

879
00:53:29,607 --> 00:53:30,767
Just gimme the camera and go.

880
00:53:32,176 --> 00:53:33,511
[sighs] Fine.

881
00:53:33,644 --> 00:53:36,180
Good. Go. We don't need you.

882
00:53:36,314 --> 00:53:37,948
And I know
I don't need to tell you this,

883
00:53:38,082 --> 00:53:39,693
but since you're
such a goddamned amateur,

884
00:53:39,717 --> 00:53:41,419
I will anyway.

885
00:53:41,552 --> 00:53:42,753
Keep your mouth shut.

886
00:53:53,731 --> 00:53:54,732
[door creaks]

887
00:53:56,534 --> 00:53:58,254
If we're gonna do this,
we should leave now.

888
00:53:59,904 --> 00:54:01,205
We're really
gonna go back there?

889
00:54:02,473 --> 00:54:03,473
What'd I just say?

890
00:54:05,109 --> 00:54:06,109
Jeff, are you in or out?

891
00:54:23,328 --> 00:54:24,328
[Gene] What?

892
00:54:25,430 --> 00:54:27,031
I'm down for this. I am.

893
00:54:27,164 --> 00:54:29,734
- But, uh...
- But what?

894
00:54:29,867 --> 00:54:31,307
What time did the guy
take the drugs?

895
00:54:31,436 --> 00:54:33,438
We gave it to him, what?
Three hours ago?

896
00:54:33,571 --> 00:54:35,105
I don't even know
if he finished it.

897
00:54:35,239 --> 00:54:36,273
He might be awake by now.

898
00:54:36,407 --> 00:54:37,908
Don't worry about it.

899
00:54:38,042 --> 00:54:39,344
Yeah, but...

900
00:54:39,477 --> 00:54:40,945
I said don't worry about it.

901
00:54:41,078 --> 00:54:42,078
It'll be fine.

902
00:54:55,626 --> 00:54:56,961
That's it. Right there.

903
00:55:04,101 --> 00:55:06,971
[sighs] Come back
and get me in 20 minutes.

904
00:55:07,104 --> 00:55:09,173
Just roll up slow,
like you're picking up a fare.

905
00:55:10,441 --> 00:55:12,777
It'll be fine. Relax.

906
00:55:31,429 --> 00:55:34,465
[indistinct chatter]

907
