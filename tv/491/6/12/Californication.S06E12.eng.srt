1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,029
Previously on Californication...

2
00:00:02,030 --> 00:00:04,342
The Miss's caught me eating one of her chocolate bars

3
00:00:04,343 --> 00:00:07,225
out of the cleaning lady's vagina.
Hello, darling.

4
00:00:07,226 --> 00:00:09,822
You fucking fuckface!

5
00:00:09,823 --> 00:00:12,653
I would like you to meet
the poet and philosopher...

6
00:00:12,654 --> 00:00:15,133
- Holy shit, that's Marilyn Manson
- Marilyn Manson.

7
00:00:15,134 --> 00:00:17,828
We are talking about doing
a duet together.

8
00:00:17,829 --> 00:00:20,669
Maybe tour of the States.
That would be really something, right?

9
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:22,259
I'm just here for the narcotics.

10
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:24,848
- We're getting married !!
- The Runkles!

11
00:00:24,849 --> 00:00:28,531
I'll fucking marry you Fuckers
on stage at the Greek!

12
00:00:28,532 --> 00:00:30,100
Fuck Yeah, why not?

13
00:00:30,101 --> 00:00:32,347
- You guys are coming on Tour, Right ?
- What ?

14
00:00:32,348 --> 00:00:34,100
We gotta keep writing this musical.

15
00:00:34,101 --> 00:00:37,765
If we are not together, I don't expect you
to have taken some vow of celibacy.

16
00:00:37,766 --> 00:00:40,285
Karen, you want me not to see 
anybody else, just say the word.

17
00:00:40,286 --> 00:00:44,511
I decided to go abroad, for an
indeterminate amount of time.

18
00:00:44,512 --> 00:00:46,844
I want to make a
literary pilgrimage.

19
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:49,959
Watching her go, I don't know...

20
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,973
It kinda feels like
the end of something.

21
00:00:51,974 --> 00:00:56,102
Makes you wonder if she was the only thing that was still keeping us together.

22
00:01:05,737 --> 00:01:07,909
How can you even debate this shit?

23
00:01:08,513 --> 00:01:13,244
Go. Hit the road, don't look back, you fucking idiot.

24
00:01:13,245 --> 00:01:14,677
Right, what if...
What if...

25
00:01:14,678 --> 00:01:17,416
You've lived your entire adult life
according to "what if".

26
00:01:17,417 --> 00:01:20,009
What if the one you think is "the one" is not really "the one"?

27
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:24,206
What if you shut your fucking piehole
and pour me another drink?

28
00:01:24,207 --> 00:01:25,928
You came to see me.

29
00:01:25,929 --> 00:01:28,278
Yeah, but I can't help where my dreams take me.

30
00:01:28,279 --> 00:01:30,511
Yeah, but what do you dream about when you get there?

31
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:33,477
That says a lot.

32
00:01:36,012 --> 00:01:37,711
What the fuck is wrong with that ass?

33
00:01:38,843 --> 00:01:41,445
Nothing.
She's pretty amazing.

34
00:01:41,446 --> 00:01:43,821
In some way, she's perfect for me.

35
00:01:43,822 --> 00:01:45,715
The eternal dilemma, isn't it?

36
00:01:46,576 --> 00:01:50,144
"Home, sweet home" vs. "the wild cold world outside your door" .

37
00:01:51,539 --> 00:01:54,497
You know which way you chosen,
you died to regret it.

38
00:01:54,498 --> 00:01:56,602
Says who?
It's not even me talking.

39
00:01:56,603 --> 00:01:58,754
You know that. 
I just ask the questions.

40
00:01:58,755 --> 00:02:01,306
Why are you so afraid to give up and let go?

41
00:02:02,528 --> 00:02:07,134
It's ok, Hank. 
We tried and we failed.

42
00:02:08,031 --> 00:02:09,970
It's not the end of the world.

43
00:02:09,971 --> 00:02:12,587
But, if I gave up on us, what would I have left?

44
00:02:13,618 --> 00:02:15,353
The rest of your life.

45
00:02:15,354 --> 00:02:16,783
Hank.

46
00:02:19,114 --> 00:02:20,574
You OK?

47
00:02:22,581 --> 00:02:24,700
Just a wet dream

48
00:02:24,701 --> 00:02:27,974
Why on earth are you packing so early?

49
00:02:27,975 --> 00:02:30,586
Well, first of all, it's noon

50
00:02:31,244 --> 00:02:35,888
And second, I'm still leaving after the show tonight

51
00:02:37,111 --> 00:02:39,539
Which brings us to the real question

52
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,758
Should I be packing for two?

53
00:02:42,567 --> 00:02:44,249
Cause I'm pretty sure

54
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:48,549
I could fit in a multitude of
black T-shirts and jeans and...

55
00:02:54,016 --> 00:02:58,920
Or I could be possibly persuaded to come back to bed

56
00:02:58,921 --> 00:03:02,270
And postpone packing

57
00:03:04,913 --> 00:03:06,524
Be more persuasive

58
00:03:06,525 --> 00:03:08,085
Are you pushing my head now?

59
00:03:08,086 --> 00:03:09,851
- Oh my god!
- Just a little bit.

[InSUBs]
 Quality is irreplaceable!

64
00:04:06,721 --> 00:04:09,521
And... I'm hard!

65
00:04:09,522 --> 00:04:10,938
Thanks, Hanky.

66
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:13,234
Let me check..

67
00:04:13,235 --> 00:04:15,832
You're a liar.
And I love you for it.

68
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:18,949
That's hardly appropriate.
Sorry, naughty smurf.

69
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:20,810
She's not married yet.

70
00:04:20,811 --> 00:04:22,641
Are you sure you wanna go through with this?

71
00:04:22,642 --> 00:04:26,109
- Why are you trying to talk her out of it?
-Yeah, why you be trying to talk me out of it?

72
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:29,729
Charlie and Marcy Runkle are the
Fred and Ethel Mertz of our time

73
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:31,335
They belongs together.

74
00:04:31,336 --> 00:04:33,287
That's right.
And if you'll excuse me,

75
00:04:33,288 --> 00:04:38,666
Ethel has to make yellow while 
Lucy and Ricky discuss their issues and what not.

76
00:04:41,924 --> 00:04:44,863
So I've... I've a chance to go with Atticus on the road.

77
00:04:44,864 --> 00:04:47,155
- Yeah?
- And I thought maybe...

78
00:04:48,533 --> 00:04:50,792
You would wanna talk about it,
talk, I don't know.

79
00:04:50,793 --> 00:04:53,030
I shouldn't even factor into your decision

80
00:04:53,031 --> 00:04:54,667
But you do,
you always do.

81
00:04:55,816 --> 00:04:57,228
Well...Hank, what do 
you want me to do?

82
00:04:57,229 --> 00:05:01,852
I mean... to say:
"Oh, please, stay!"

83
00:05:01,853 --> 00:05:03,531
Let's live happily ever after

84
00:05:03,532 --> 00:05:05,733
I can't do that.
Do you want my permission?

85
00:05:05,734 --> 00:05:09,535
I mean, you're a big boy.
You're gonna make your own 
decision about it, anyways.

86
00:05:09,536 --> 00:05:13,756
Besides, I... I thought you're in a
relationship with someone.

87
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:18,822
Well, maybe that's what's
good for you then,

88
00:05:18,823 --> 00:05:21,162
like a non-relationship relationship.

89
00:05:21,163 --> 00:05:23,305
Cause you have a hard time functioning

90
00:05:23,306 --> 00:05:26,165
within the confines of a traditional one.

91
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:29,509
Well, it was never anything 
traditional about us

92
00:05:30,436 --> 00:05:32,643
Have you heard from our
literary pilgrim?

93
00:05:32,644 --> 00:05:35,922
No, only what she puts up on Instagram.

94
00:05:37,273 --> 00:05:38,735
What's Instagram?

95
00:05:38,736 --> 00:05:42,537
Ok, you guys working shit out?

96
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:45,884
You back together?

97
00:05:45,885 --> 00:05:48,721
I guess not.
Ok, here's the deal:

98
00:05:48,722 --> 00:05:52,874
Me and CW Runks are gonna do this thing.
And do you know why?

99
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:56,063
- No, why?
- Because we're gonna be fucking happy.

100
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:57,708
- And you know why?
- Why?

101
00:05:57,709 --> 00:06:02,245
Because it's better than being
fucking miserable all the time.

102
00:06:02,246 --> 00:06:04,124
This whole time we've been out here

103
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:08,957
it's been like a midlife crisis roller coaster ride.
And it's fucking over!

104
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:13,471
Now. So let's all just live happily ever after.

105
00:06:13,472 --> 00:06:16,423
Ok? Good?
It's settled?

106
00:06:16,424 --> 00:06:18,294
Good!

107
00:06:28,277 --> 00:06:29,709
What's going on?

108
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:32,460
Atticus's had to sell the plane to fund the tour

109
00:06:32,461 --> 00:06:35,665
And the record company ain't giving him
the kind of support they used to.

110
00:06:35,666 --> 00:06:38,088
And no thanks to that nutjob missus of his,

111
00:06:38,089 --> 00:06:41,026
he's having some serious
cash flow problems.

112
00:06:41,027 --> 00:06:42,700
We're back to touring by bus.

113
00:06:42,701 --> 00:06:44,941
- Where is that fucking ginger?
- He's in the bedroom.

114
00:06:44,942 --> 00:06:46,873
He wants to talk with someone 
who understands

115
00:06:46,874 --> 00:06:48,295
what it's like to live with heartbreak

116
00:06:48,296 --> 00:06:51,193
I told him, you know, 
I've got lots of experience,

117
00:06:51,194 --> 00:06:53,560
but no, he doesn't care, he wants you.

118
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,396
Hey Atticus!

119
00:06:57,397 --> 00:06:59,212
What's up rock star?

120
00:06:59,213 --> 00:07:01,155
I can't play the gig tonight, Hank.

121
00:07:02,274 --> 00:07:04,155
Why is that?

122
00:07:04,156 --> 00:07:05,687
I went home this morning,

123
00:07:05,688 --> 00:07:09,113
and got down on bended knee, 
and asked Natalie to take me back.

124
00:07:09,114 --> 00:07:11,288
And she told me to fuck off.

125
00:07:11,289 --> 00:07:14,213
She's really done with me, 
which is understandable

126
00:07:14,214 --> 00:07:16,462
given my behavior.

127
00:07:16,463 --> 00:07:20,866
But I've never done an opening night
without a good luck kiss from her.

128
00:07:20,867 --> 00:07:25,926
Back in the early day, she used to give me
this really comprehensive blow job, like balls and all, you know?

129
00:07:26,695 --> 00:07:28,938
Although, I was usually too wired to come.

130
00:07:28,939 --> 00:07:31,272
That's a cute story, buddy.

131
00:07:31,273 --> 00:07:34,149
But I'm afraid the big rock show must go on

132
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:39,390
But I haven't been on a bus
in well over 10 years.

133
00:07:39,391 --> 00:07:42,345
It's so embarrassingly bargain basement.

134
00:07:42,346 --> 00:07:46,321
Are you kidding? That bus 
out there, that's beautiful. That bus.

135
00:07:46,322 --> 00:07:49,005
- Really, you like it?
- Yes, I love it. It's bad ass.

136
00:07:49,006 --> 00:07:51,480
- It's cool?
- It's so cool.

137
00:07:51,481 --> 00:07:53,203
It's like a land airplane

138
00:07:53,204 --> 00:07:55,651
It's gas friendly, eco-friendly

139
00:07:55,652 --> 00:07:57,833
You'll probably get an award for that shit.

140
00:07:59,264 --> 00:08:01,252
- How do you do it, Hank?
- Do what?

141
00:08:02,223 --> 00:08:04,235
The woman that you love is out there

142
00:08:04,236 --> 00:08:06,637
and you know you can't have her.

143
00:08:06,638 --> 00:08:09,861
How do you even get up in the morning?

144
00:08:09,862 --> 00:08:12,931
Booze is always helpful

145
00:08:13,895 --> 00:08:16,037
So is the art.

146
00:08:16,038 --> 00:08:21,695
Everything that I write
is either for her, or about her, so

147
00:08:21,696 --> 00:08:24,898
I'm with her, even when I'm not,

148
00:08:24,899 --> 00:08:26,688
in my writing.

149
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:30,714
That's very moving, Hank.

150
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:34,566
- Don't cry!
- Why?

151
00:08:34,567 --> 00:08:38,240
It's unbecoming.

152
00:08:38,241 --> 00:08:40,675
You said something moving,
why shouldn't I cry?

153
00:08:40,676 --> 00:08:42,779
What about your aussie blockiness?

154
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:46,955
Or your British stiff upper lip. 
Whatever the fuck you are.

155
00:08:46,956 --> 00:08:49,586
I think you should come on tour with me, Hank.

156
00:08:49,587 --> 00:08:52,955
I feel like if we finish our 
master piece,

157
00:08:52,956 --> 00:08:55,956
our rock opera about love,

158
00:08:57,007 --> 00:08:59,753
maybe we'll both end up with the girl

159
00:09:01,339 --> 00:09:03,107
I'll think about it.

160
00:09:06,794 --> 00:09:08,289
In the meantime.

161
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:10,996
Are you ready to rock out,
or do you cock out?

162
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:33,653
I'll admit this is pretty cool.

163
00:09:33,654 --> 00:09:36,626
It's like Disneyland every day

164
00:09:36,627 --> 00:09:39,301
Yeah. Without the morbidly obese 
running around in scooters

165
00:09:39,302 --> 00:09:41,893
Even the concept of time is different, you know,

166
00:09:41,894 --> 00:09:46,844
it's rock and roll fucking summer camp forever.

167
00:09:46,845 --> 00:09:51,026
- It's got to end at some point, doesn't it?
- Says who?

168
00:09:51,027 --> 00:09:54,818
All roads lead back home eventually

169
00:09:54,819 --> 00:09:57,501
Sounds like a Country song

170
00:09:57,502 --> 00:10:00,301
Hey. You're Faith, right?

171
00:10:00,302 --> 00:10:02,379
Yeah, that's me.

172
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:05,355
I'm Vince, from Mysstery.

173
00:10:05,356 --> 00:10:08,102
Two s's. We're opening the show tonight

174
00:10:08,874 --> 00:10:11,382
Well... Hey, Vince from Mistery
with to s's

175
00:10:11,383 --> 00:10:14,071
- Good luck up there.
- Cool, thanks.

176
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:17,067
I'm wondering if maybe you
want to come hang on our bus

177
00:10:17,068 --> 00:10:19,054
It's the one that says
"Cat Club"

178
00:10:19,055 --> 00:10:21,902
We call it that because
chicks who want to come on

179
00:10:21,903 --> 00:10:24,540
we ask them to pee on this
litter box we keep by the front door

180
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:28,059
This way we know for sure that
they're willing to party

181
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:29,971
I'm free,
I got a full bladder.

182
00:10:29,972 --> 00:10:32,809
I don't think you'd have
to do that, though

183
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:34,829
because you're pretty famous

184
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:37,790
Thanks for the preferential
treatment and all, no thanks

185
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:40,882
What? We're not big enough
for the legendary Faith?

186
00:10:40,883 --> 00:10:42,664
No, no, it's not like that at all

187
00:10:42,665 --> 00:10:45,473
But if you're gonna be a dick about it,
I can just come clean

188
00:10:45,474 --> 00:10:46,874
You're just not really that talented

189
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:49,404
I've heard your album
and it's really shitty mall metal

190
00:10:49,405 --> 00:10:51,556
So, if I were you, I would
just quit now

191
00:10:51,557 --> 00:10:53,877
and maybe Hot Topic will hire
you back this summer

192
00:10:53,878 --> 00:10:56,213
Wow, you're kind of a bitch!

193
00:10:56,214 --> 00:10:59,452
Hey, watch your manners, son.
That's no way to talk to a lady.

194
00:10:59,453 --> 00:11:01,524
Fuck off, dad.

195
00:11:01,525 --> 00:11:03,273
You know what this calls for?

196
00:11:03,274 --> 00:11:04,736
Titty twister!

197
00:11:25,394 --> 00:11:27,953
Good evening, Los Angeles!

198
00:11:27,954 --> 00:11:29,921
You wanted the best?

199
00:11:29,922 --> 00:11:33,769
Well I got stuck in the traffic
coming on the fucking hill.

200
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:36,329
From London, England,
by way of Mars

201
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:38,697
The Bacardi Concert series presents:

202
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:41,626
Atticus Fucking-Fetch!

203
00:12:07,581 --> 00:12:11,265
Good luck out there.
Not that you need it.

204
00:12:11,266 --> 00:12:14,450
You're a fucking rock star

205
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,549
A long way from church, eh?

206
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:26,590
Are you kidding me?

207
00:13:53,428 --> 00:13:56,647
Do you, bald fucking wanker,

208
00:13:56,648 --> 00:14:00,366
take this sexy little tree stump

209
00:14:00,367 --> 00:14:03,767
to be your immortal beloved?

210
00:14:03,768 --> 00:14:06,444
I most certainly do.

211
00:14:06,445 --> 00:14:08,125
Do!

212
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:11,836
Right.
And do you,

213
00:14:11,837 --> 00:14:13,757
delicious little spinner

214
00:14:13,758 --> 00:14:16,093
with whom I have shared 
a sexual encounter

215
00:14:16,094 --> 00:14:19,534
which will sustain me
well into my golden years,

216
00:14:19,535 --> 00:14:21,652
take this...

217
00:14:21,653 --> 00:14:24,642
sweaty hairless pinhead

218
00:14:24,643 --> 00:14:28,854
to be the very last
sexual parter of you entire life?

219
00:14:28,855 --> 00:14:30,798
Jesus!...

220
00:14:32,809 --> 00:14:35,167
Well, when you put it like that...

221
00:14:36,063 --> 00:14:38,847
Let's do(ce) it.
I do(ce) it.

222
00:14:44,632 --> 00:14:47,712
Good. (*)
Let's get on with it.

223
00:14:52,108 --> 00:14:53,559
By the power vested on me

224
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:56,999
by the Sun Kill Moon ministry
of Northern California

225
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,016
I now pronounce you wife 
and (*) man

226
00:15:09,893 --> 00:15:13,204
Now, while we're here,
does anyone else feel like getting wedded

227
00:15:13,205 --> 00:15:17,097
on this glorious, glorious LA evening?

228
00:15:17,098 --> 00:15:20,591
Anyone?

229
00:15:21,689 --> 00:15:24,159
Anyone?

230
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,717
Karen

231
00:15:35,231 --> 00:15:37,902
Karen, be with me.

232
00:15:37,903 --> 00:15:39,942
Spend the rest of your life
with this fool,

233
00:15:39,943 --> 00:15:44,806
and this fool will spend the rest of 
his life making sure you don't regret it

234
00:15:46,016 --> 00:15:48,052
What do you say, babe?

235
00:15:48,053 --> 00:15:51,230
- [audience] Say Yes!
- Will you be my wife?

236
00:15:51,231 --> 00:15:53,807
Come on!
Say yes!

237
00:15:58,348 --> 00:16:00,782
No?
Nobody?

238
00:16:01,405 --> 00:16:02,955
Really?

239
00:16:04,888 --> 00:16:10,134
No? Then get the fuck off my stage.
Be gone, all of you!

240
00:16:14,284 --> 00:16:16,917
I wrote this next song
for my wife, Natalie

241
00:16:16,918 --> 00:16:20,189
in hope that she'll forgive me

242
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:23,362
although if she did, I'll probably
just bugger it up all over again

243
00:16:24,414 --> 00:16:27,858
But tonight I'm gonna play it
for my good friend and collaborator

244
00:16:27,859 --> 00:16:32,399
Hank Moody. Who knows a thing 
or two about heart break himself

245
00:17:26,042 --> 00:17:29,497
- Wait, you look familiar.
- Hank Moody

246
00:17:29,498 --> 00:17:30,898
- Come on
- Manson

247
00:17:30,899 --> 00:17:33,460
Thank you for coming to
my fucking mother show

248
00:17:33,461 --> 00:17:34,955
Hi, Brian.

249
00:17:35,356 --> 00:17:37,504
Actually, I'm surprised that you came

250
00:17:37,505 --> 00:17:40,239
I just want to make it clear,
I was just fucking with you.

251
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,129
I would not give drugs to your daughter.

252
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:45,067
Because I need them for later.

253
00:17:45,068 --> 00:17:46,545
But wait. How is the kid?

254
00:17:46,546 --> 00:17:48,294
- She's great.
- Good, good.

255
00:17:48,295 --> 00:17:50,795
Would you get her to send me the 
picture of me tea-bagging Atticus?

256
00:17:50,796 --> 00:17:52,907
- Will do
- Because I want to put that on my Facebook

257
00:17:52,908 --> 00:17:54,396
Will do

258
00:17:55,373 --> 00:17:58,254
And if you guys aren't together
I would pee in your butt

259
00:17:58,255 --> 00:18:00,094
What?!

260
00:18:01,426 --> 00:18:03,746
It's Becca.

261
00:18:03,747 --> 00:18:06,418
- Hey sweetie
- Hi, dad

262
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:10,285
- How's the road treating you?
- It's so beautiful out here, dad.

263
00:18:10,286 --> 00:18:12,430
I'm having the time of my life

264
00:18:12,431 --> 00:18:16,566
- And tomorrow we leave for Europe
- Glad to hear it

265
00:18:16,967 --> 00:18:22,526
- Are you happy, Dad?
- That's a loaded question

266
00:18:22,527 --> 00:18:25,767
I was just thinking about
what I want for all the people in my life

267
00:18:25,768 --> 00:18:29,002
And I realized that I just
wanted you to be happy

268
00:18:29,003 --> 00:18:31,997
I want to see you smile
and know you mean it

269
00:18:33,583 --> 00:18:36,812
- are you high right now?
- significantly

270
00:18:36,813 --> 00:18:39,027
We just smoked some killer weed.

271
00:18:39,028 --> 00:18:40,428
Of course you did

272
00:18:41,498 --> 00:18:44,029
Be careful

273
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:47,658
And have fun, just not too much

274
00:18:47,659 --> 00:18:49,059
Don't worry, dad

275
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:51,225
All roads lead back home

276
00:18:51,226 --> 00:18:53,776
That sounds like a Country song

277
00:18:54,661 --> 00:18:58,403
- I love you, dad
- I love you too, sweetie

278
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:01,651
Would you do me a favor and 
send Manson

279
00:19:01,652 --> 00:19:04,184
that photo of him tea-bagging Atticus

280
00:19:04,185 --> 00:19:06,434
Ok, will do

281
00:19:06,435 --> 00:19:08,607
Ok, sweetie, I love you

282
00:19:19,816 --> 00:19:21,473
I'm coming with you

283
00:19:25,711 --> 00:19:29,416
That makes me so very happy

284
00:20:12,681 --> 00:20:16,090
Good for you, man.
You made the right decision

285
00:20:16,091 --> 00:20:19,077
Besides, even if you actually had the balls
to do it, and she actually said yes

286
00:20:19,078 --> 00:20:22,617
- what would you have done?
- I would've married her right then and there.

287
00:20:23,018 --> 00:20:25,399
And then, what? You would have fucked
like rabbits for a couple days,

288
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,693
you would have had some sweet little
pillow talk, and then one day she would

289
00:20:27,694 --> 00:20:30,844
ask you to go to Home Depot with her.
Party is over

290
00:20:31,245 --> 00:20:33,952
You know, you talk a good game,
but I was with you when you died

291
00:20:33,953 --> 00:20:37,960
and you were about to do it. You were gonna take
one last shot at the love of your life, buddy.

292
00:20:37,961 --> 00:20:41,268
Sure, I would have given it a try.
Maybe I could even got her back in the sack again.

293
00:20:41,269 --> 00:20:43,519
But eventually, you get out of bed.

294
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:48,268
You're still you. All the problems
you've ever had, they're still there.

295
00:20:48,269 --> 00:20:49,957
So you're just supposed to give up?

296
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:52,117
It's not about giving up. It's about letting go.

297
00:20:52,118 --> 00:20:54,870
Finally accepting who you are.

298
00:20:56,007 --> 00:20:57,646
Guess who

299
00:21:00,578 --> 00:21:03,431
God, I can't wait for her to die 
and come down

300
00:21:08,038 --> 00:21:09,590
Karen?

301
00:21:12,625 --> 00:21:14,098
Karen!

302
00:21:27,234 --> 00:21:29,771
You have to go, don't you?

303
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:32,829
Yeah, I do.

304
00:21:34,158 --> 00:21:36,317
I'm sorry, I do.

305
00:21:40,038 --> 00:21:41,554
Don't be.

306
00:21:50,517 --> 00:21:53,150
You just don't know what you're 
gonna be missing.

307
00:21:53,151 --> 00:21:54,554
I do.

308
00:21:54,955 --> 00:21:56,955
That's what makes it is so hard.

309
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:03,769
- I could love you, you know.
- Faith...

310
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:08,208
I'm... I'm not saying that I do.

311
00:22:09,434 --> 00:22:13,202
I'm saying that I could.

312
00:22:14,144 --> 00:22:18,475
Which is rare for me,
and deserves to be acknowledged

313
00:22:19,491 --> 00:22:24,562
You understand me, better than
any guy I've ever met

314
00:22:25,435 --> 00:22:27,261
You get me.

315
00:22:28,886 --> 00:22:34,093
And that has been the nicest feeling

316
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:39,362
I'm just saying.

317
00:22:39,363 --> 00:22:42,936
And I'm just saying that you're 
pretty fucking amazing.

318
00:22:43,337 --> 00:22:46,639
And I hope you find what you're looking for out here.

319
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,671
I hope you find what you're looking for out back there

320
00:22:51,356 --> 00:22:53,923
I'll even say a prayer for you.

321
00:22:53,924 --> 00:22:57,826
Just not a very big one

322
00:22:59,511 --> 00:23:03,527
- I hate saying goodbye to you
- Then don't

323
00:23:04,541 --> 00:23:06,181
You know what?

324
00:23:06,582 --> 00:23:10,838
The great thing about
never really being together:

325
00:23:10,839 --> 00:23:13,586
never really have to break up

326
00:23:14,917 --> 00:23:18,390
Hank, get the fuck out of here

327
00:23:18,391 --> 00:23:22,473
Before I wrap my legs around you
and convince you to stay.

328
00:23:22,474 --> 00:23:25,051
And you know I can do it.

329
00:23:53,816 --> 00:23:55,278
What is this? Wow what?

330
00:23:58,079 --> 00:24:00,608
- What's going on?
- Hank's got to go

331
00:24:00,609 --> 00:24:02,872
He's got to see a horse about a girl

332
00:24:02,873 --> 00:24:06,027
Is this about following your bliss?

333
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:09,291
That what we were talking
about in bed yesterday?

334
00:24:09,292 --> 00:24:12,727
- Is it about love?
- It is

335
00:24:12,728 --> 00:24:14,259
Then you must go.

336
00:24:15,429 --> 00:24:17,135
I can't turn the bus around,

337
00:24:17,136 --> 00:24:19,380
but I can send an emissary.

338
00:24:28,713 --> 00:24:30,683
Sorry, crying again.

339
00:24:30,684 --> 00:24:33,068
Don't be sorry. It's unbecoming.

340
00:24:36,015 --> 00:24:41,302
All right, you. Go. My work here is done.

341
00:24:44,303 --> 00:24:47,455
I really see to you happily ever after

342
00:25:44,137 --> 00:25:46,388
I know he means a great deal to you,

343
00:25:46,389 --> 00:25:48,577
as he does to me.

344
00:25:48,578 --> 00:25:53,281
And I just want you to know that 
I'm here for you, if you need me

345
00:25:53,282 --> 00:25:55,768
Emotionally,

346
00:25:55,769 --> 00:25:57,594
spiritually,

347
00:25:57,595 --> 00:25:59,960
and obviously sexually.

348
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:03,288
Thank you, Atticus

349
00:26:03,289 --> 00:26:04,700
I'm serious, darling.

350
00:26:04,701 --> 00:26:07,878
Sometimes and orgasm can
relieve heartache

351
00:26:07,879 --> 00:26:10,082
I've done a lot of research
in the area

352
00:26:10,083 --> 00:26:13,429
Can I at least get a good luck kiss?
I do have a gig tonight, you know.

353
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:15,543
I'm a bit nervous

354
00:26:58,252 --> 00:27:01,178
I know you're not one for
emoting, Krull,

355
00:27:01,179 --> 00:27:02,609
but thank you

356
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:04,462
I had a girl once

357
00:27:04,463 --> 00:27:06,423
love of my life she was

358
00:27:06,424 --> 00:27:09,490
Fucked it up, of course.

359
00:27:09,491 --> 00:27:11,659
I thought there'd be time.

360
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:14,357
Turns out, it's just roads

361
00:27:14,358 --> 00:27:17,715
Long and paved potholes

362
00:27:17,716 --> 00:27:20,001
I read that once in a book.

363
00:27:20,696 --> 00:27:22,945
Go and get her, pal

364
00:27:42,261 --> 00:27:45,261
