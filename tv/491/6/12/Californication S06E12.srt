00:00:00,066 --> 00:00:02,254
《加州靡情》前情回顾
Previously on Californication...

2
00:00:02,255 --> 00:00:04,496
我拿老婆的巧克力棒插清洁工的小穴
The miss's got me eating one of her chocolate bars

3
00:00:04,497 --> 00:00:06,253
然后吃掉  结果被她抓到了
out of cleaning lady's vagina.

4
00:00:06,254 --> 00:00:07,048
嗨  宝贝儿
Hello, darling.

5
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:09,824
你这操蛋的渣男
You fucking fuckface!

6
00:00:09,825 --> 00:00:12,752
来认识这位诗人以及哲人
I'd like you to meet the poet and philosopher...

7
00:00:12,753 --> 00:00:15,202
-老天  那是麦瑞林・曼森  -没错
- Oh Shit, it's Marilyn Manson - Marilyn Manson.

8
00:00:15,203 --> 00:00:17,925
我们计划着搞个二重唱
We are talking about doing a duet together.

9
00:00:17,926 --> 00:00:20,688
可能在国内巡演  这是件大事  对吧
Maybe tour of the States. It would be something, right?

10
00:00:20,689 --> 00:00:22,271
我只是来吸粉的
I'm just here for the narcotics.

11
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:24,877
-我们准备结婚了  -朗克夫妇
- We're getting married !! - The Runkles!

12
00:00:24,878 --> 00:00:28,581
我会在希腊剧院的舞台上主持婚礼
I'll fucking marry you fuckers on stage at the Greek!

13
00:00:28,582 --> 00:00:30,169
太他妈赞成了
Fuck yeah, why not?

14
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:32,419
-你们也会来的  对吧  -什么
- You guys are coming on tour, right ? - What ?

15
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,177
我们得继续写这个音乐剧
We gotta keep writing this musical.

16
00:00:34,178 --> 00:00:34,866
如果我们不在一起
If we are not together,

17
00:00:34,867 --> 00:00:37,600
我也不会要你发什么独身誓言
I don't expect you to have taken some vow of celibacy.

18
00:00:37,601 --> 00:00:40,386
凯伦  你要我不看别人就直接说出来
Karen, you want me to not see anybody else, just say the word.

19
00:00:40,387 --> 00:00:44,590
我决定出国一段时间
I decided to go abroad, for an undetermined amount of time.

20
00:00:44,591 --> 00:00:47,090
我要进行一场文学朝圣
I want to make a literary pilgrimage.

21
00:00:48,634 --> 00:00:50,012
看着她离开  我不知道怎么说  就像
watching her go, I don't know.

22
00:00:50,013 --> 00:00:51,989
就像一些事情已到尽头
It kinda feels like the end of something.

23
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:52,890
让你忍不住会想
Makes you wonder

24
00:00:52,891 --> 00:00:56,195
她是不是我们还在一起的唯一理由
if she was the only thing that was still keeping us together.

25
00:01:05,793 --> 00:01:07,976
你还争论个屁啊
How can you even debate this shit?

26
00:01:08,525 --> 00:01:13,336
去吧  上路吧  别回头  你个傻缺
Go. Hit the road, don't look back, you fucking idiot.

27
00:01:13,337 --> 00:01:14,634
-对  那如果...  -如果你妹啊
- Right, what if... - What if...

28
00:01:14,635 --> 00:01:17,218
你这辈子就掉"如果"里了
You've lived your entire adult life according to "what if".

29
00:01:17,219 --> 00:01:19,942
如果你想的那个人并不是你的真命天女呢
What if the one you think is "the one" Is not really "the one"?

30
00:01:19,943 --> 00:01:24,250
你为何不闭上你的臭嘴再去给我到点酒呢
What if you shut your fucking piehole and pour me another drink?

31
00:01:24,289 --> 00:01:25,604
你怎么想起来看我了
You came to see me.

32
00:01:26,135 --> 00:01:28,283
对  但我也不知道我会梦到什么
Yeah, but I can't help where my dreams take me.

33
00:01:28,284 --> 00:01:30,435
对  但你到那的时候梦到了什么
Yeah, but what do you dream about when you get there?

34
00:01:31,665 --> 00:01:33,053
你的表情已经告诉我了
That says a lot.

35
00:01:36,025 --> 00:01:37,891
那个傻妞是怎么回事
What the fuck is wrong with that ass?

36
00:01:38,884 --> 00:01:41,484
没什么  她很赞
Nothing. She's pretty amazing.

37
00:01:41,485 --> 00:01:44,000
某种程度上  她很适合我
In some way, she's perfect for me.

38
00:01:44,005 --> 00:01:45,845
该来的总会来的  对吧
The eternal dilema, isn't it?

39
00:01:46,864 --> 00:01:50,601
"家花"和"野花"之间的抉择
"Home, sweet home" Vs. "The wild cold world outside your door" .

40
00:01:51,619 --> 00:01:54,386
你知道你的选择  你死都不后悔吗
You know which way you chosen. You'd die to regret it?

41
00:01:54,387 --> 00:01:56,508
谁说的  我才不会这么说
Says who? It's not even me talking.

42
00:01:56,509 --> 00:01:58,952
你懂的  我只是在问你问题
You know that. I just ask the questions.

43
00:01:59,143 --> 00:02:01,438
你为什么这么怕放开她
Why are you so afraid to give up and let go?

44
00:02:02,659 --> 00:02:07,341
没关系  汉克  我们试过但失败了
It's ok, Hank. We tried and we failed.

45
00:02:08,011 --> 00:02:09,845
那不会是世界末日的
It's not the end of the world.

46
00:02:09,947 --> 00:02:12,884
但我要是放弃了你  我还剩什么
But, if I gave up on us, what would I have left?

47
00:02:13,597 --> 00:02:15,240
你的余生
The rest of your life.

48
00:02:15,575 --> 00:02:16,552
汉克
Hank.

49
00:02:19,117 --> 00:02:20,108
你没事吧
You OK?

50
00:02:22,664 --> 00:02:24,019
梦遗了而已
Just a wet dream.

51
00:02:24,687 --> 00:02:27,978
你怎么这么早就收拾行李了
Why on earth are you packing so early?

52
00:02:27,979 --> 00:02:30,951
首先  现在是中午了
Well, first of all, it's noon.

53
00:02:31,505 --> 00:02:36,156
第二  今晚演出结束后我还是会走的
And second, I'm still leaving after the show tonight

54
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:39,555
所以我们面临着一个实质性问题
which brings us to the real question,

55
00:02:40,053 --> 00:02:41,803
我是否应该打包两份行李
should I be packing for two?

56
00:02:42,576 --> 00:02:44,121
因为我非常确定
Cause I'm pretty sure

57
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:48,812
你的那些黑T恤和牛仔裤我都能穿
I can fit in a multitude of black T-shirts and jeans and...

58
00:02:54,052 --> 00:02:59,076
或者你可以先说服我来一炮
or I could be possibly persuaded to come back to bed

59
00:02:59,556 --> 00:03:02,040
然后再去收拾
and postpone packing,

60
00:03:04,979 --> 00:03:06,478
快说服我  [要汉克去舔她下面]
Be more persuasive.

61
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:08,132
你现在是在推我的头吗
Are you pushing my head now?

62
00:03:08,133 --> 00:03:09,924
-天呐  -就一点点想
- Oh my god! - Just a little bit.

63
00:03:10,394 --> 00:03:15,125
《加州靡情》第6季第12集

64
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,379
我硬了
And... I'm hard!

65
00:04:09,642 --> 00:04:11,150
我谢你  汉克
Thanks, Hanky.

66
00:04:11,815 --> 00:04:13,149
让我检查下
Let me check..

67
00:04:13,458 --> 00:04:15,795
你个骗子  最喜欢你这点了
You're a liar. And love you for it.

68
00:04:15,796 --> 00:04:18,904
那可不行  抱歉  小淘气
That's hardly appropriate. Sorry, naughty smurf.

69
00:04:18,905 --> 00:04:20,547
她还没结婚呢
She's not married yet.

70
00:04:21,098 --> 00:04:22,463
你确定你要穿这身去吗
Are you sure you wanna go through with this?

71
00:04:22,464 --> 00:04:23,592
那你为什么不试着说服她脱掉呢
Why are you trying to talk her out of it?

72
00:04:23,593 --> 00:04:26,095
对啊  你为什么不试着说服我脱掉呢
Yeah, why you be trying to talk me out of it?

73
00:04:26,096 --> 00:04:27,550
查理和玛茜・郎克尔简直就是
Charlie and Marcy Runkle are

74
00:04:27,551 --> 00:04:29,744
{\an8}{\fn方正黑体简体\fs18\b1\bord1\shad1\3c&H2F2F2F&}弗瑞德和埃塞尔・梅尔兹
50年代电影《我爱露西》里的人物

75
00:04:27,551 --> 00:04:29,744
现代版的弗瑞德和埃塞尔・梅尔兹啊
the Fred and Ethel Mertz of our time,

76
00:04:29,745 --> 00:04:31,333
他们是一个整体
they belongs together.

77
00:04:31,334 --> 00:04:33,399
没错  如果你不介意
That's right. If you'll excuse me,

78
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,289
埃塞尔要去补补妆了
Ethel has to make yellow while

79
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:39,281
好让露西和里基聊聊他俩的破事
Lucy and Ricky discuss their issues and what not.

80
00:04:41,804 --> 00:04:44,826
我可能会和阿提库斯一起去
So I...I've the chance to go with Atticus on the road.

81
00:04:44,827 --> 00:04:47,452
-然后呢  -然后我觉得可能...
- And? - And I thought maybe...

82
00:04:48,596 --> 00:04:50,839
你会想跟我谈谈  我也不知道
you would wanna talk about it, talk, I don't know.

83
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,960
我不应该替你做决定
I shouldn't even factor into your decision.

84
00:04:52,961 --> 00:04:54,760
但是你会的  你一直都这样
But you do, you always do.

85
00:04:54,796 --> 00:04:57,205
汉克  你想要我怎么办
Well...Hank, what do you want me to do?

86
00:04:57,206 --> 00:05:01,895
我是说  像"请留下"
I mean, "Oh, please, stay!"

87
00:05:01,896 --> 00:05:03,566
"让我们白头偕老吧"这种话
"let's live happily ever after"

88
00:05:03,567 --> 00:05:05,651
我说不出口  你是想得到我的许可吗
I can't do that. Do you want my permission?

89
00:05:05,652 --> 00:05:06,645
我是说  你是大人了
I mean, you're a big boy.

90
00:05:06,646 --> 00:05:09,700
无论如何  你都得自己拿主意
You're gonna make your own decision about it, anyways.

91
00:05:09,829 --> 00:05:14,186
另外  我想你好像跟别人正打得火热呢
Besides, I tought you're in a relationship with someone.

92
00:05:16,934 --> 00:05:18,649
也许那种非恋爱的恋爱关系
Maybe that's what's good for you then

93
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:21,228
对你也挺好
like non-relationship relationship,

94
00:05:21,229 --> 00:05:23,260
因为你不知道如何把握
cause you have hard time functioning

95
00:05:23,261 --> 00:05:26,070
一场传统的恋爱关系
within confines of a traditional one.

96
00:05:26,071 --> 00:05:29,173
好吧  但我们之间可从没传统过啊
Well, it was never anything traditional about us.

97
00:05:30,668 --> 00:05:32,690
你有咱女儿的消息吗
Have you heard from our literaly pilgrim?

98
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:36,294
{\an8}Iphone里的一款图片分享应用

99
00:05:32,691 --> 00:05:36,294
没有  只有她在图片分享上传的些照片
No, only what she puts up on Instagram.

100
00:05:37,654 --> 00:05:39,307
图片分享是什么
What's Instagram?

101
00:05:39,308 --> 00:05:42,898
你俩之间的破事儿搞定了吗
Ok, you guys working your shit out?

102
00:05:44,129 --> 00:05:45,514
和好了吗
You back together?

103
00:05:46,255 --> 00:05:48,873
我想没有  好吧  这么说吧
I guess not. Ok, here's the deal,

104
00:05:48,874 --> 00:05:52,917
我和查理要结婚了  知道为什么吗
me and CW Rocks are going to do this thing. And do you know why?

105
00:05:52,918 --> 00:05:53,813
不知道  为什么
No, why?

106
00:05:53,814 --> 00:05:56,279
因为我们会很他妈幸福的
Because we're gonna be fucking happy.

107
00:05:56,296 --> 00:05:57,760
-你知道为什么吗  -为什么
- And you know why? - Why?

108
00:05:57,761 --> 00:06:02,210
因为这他妈比一直深陷痛苦要强多了
Because it's better than being fucking miserable all the time.

109
00:06:02,351 --> 00:06:03,691
我们俩经历的这一切
This whole time we've been out here

110
00:06:03,692 --> 00:06:07,054
就像是在中年危机的过山车上
it's been like a midlife crisis roller coaster ride.

111
00:06:07,055 --> 00:06:10,269
但现在都他妈已经结束了
And it's fucking over now.

112
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:13,556
所以让我们都能白头偕老吧
So lets all just live happily ever after.

113
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:16,454
好吗  好吗  就这么决定了啊
Good? Good? It's settled?

114
00:06:16,455 --> 00:06:17,432
很好
Good!

115
00:06:28,577 --> 00:06:29,706
怎么了
What's going on?

116
00:06:29,707 --> 00:06:32,460
阿提库斯不得不卖了飞机来支撑巡演
Atticus's had to sell the plane to fund the tour

117
00:06:32,586 --> 00:06:35,680
而且唱片公司没提供往常他们都提供的赞助
and the record company ain't giving the kind of support they used to.

118
00:06:35,681 --> 00:06:38,077
并不是因为他的疯子老婆
And no thanks to that nutjob missus of his,

119
00:06:38,078 --> 00:06:40,703
他只是很缺钱
he's having some serious cash-flow problem.

120
00:06:40,886 --> 00:06:42,633
我们要开大巴去巡演
We're back to touring by bus.

121
00:06:42,634 --> 00:06:44,903
-那个黄毛怪呢  -在卧室
- Where is that fucking ginger? - He's in the bedroom.

122
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:46,814
他想跟一个知道
He wants to talk with someone who understands

123
00:06:46,815 --> 00:06:48,243
心碎是什么感觉的人谈谈
what it's like to live with heartbreak

124
00:06:48,244 --> 00:06:51,182
我跟他说我很经验的
I told him that, you know, I've got lots of experience,

125
00:06:51,183 --> 00:06:53,841
但他说他不管  他只想和你聊聊
but no, he doesn't care, he wants to talk to you.

126
00:06:55,689 --> 00:06:56,907
阿提库斯
Atticus!

127
00:06:57,704 --> 00:06:59,204
我们的摇滚明星这是怎么了
What's up rock star?

128
00:06:59,231 --> 00:07:01,022
我今晚演出不了  汉克
I can't play the gig tonight, Hank.

129
00:07:02,337 --> 00:07:03,732
为什么呢
Why is that?

130
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:05,546
我今早上回了趟家
I went home this morning,

131
00:07:05,547 --> 00:07:09,160
我跪着求娜塔莉回心转意
and got down on bended need, and asked Natalie to take me back.

132
00:07:09,161 --> 00:07:10,913
丫却叫我滚蛋
and she told me to fuck off.

133
00:07:11,476 --> 00:07:15,041
她跟我玩儿完了  她这么做也是可以理解的
She's really done with me, which is understandable given my behavior.

134
00:07:15,042 --> 00:07:18,056
但是我从没试过在没有她的幸运之吻下
But I've never done and opening

135
00:07:18,057 --> 00:07:20,828
完成整场演出
without a good luck kiss from her.

136
00:07:20,926 --> 00:07:22,429
以前她总是会给我来一次
Back in the early day, she used to give me

137
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:26,194
全方位的口交  像蛋蛋之类的都会口到
this really comprehensive blow job, like balls and all, you know?

138
00:07:26,724 --> 00:07:29,118
尽管  我会觉得很奇怪所以射不了
Though, I was usually too wired to come.

139
00:07:29,969 --> 00:07:31,307
老兄  你的故事可真可爱
That's a cute story, buddy.

140
00:07:31,308 --> 00:07:34,028
但恐怕你的演唱会还得继续
But I'm afraid the big rock-roll must go on.

141
00:07:34,395 --> 00:07:39,188
但我都10多年没坐过大巴了
But I haven't been on the bus in well over 10 years.

142
00:07:39,189 --> 00:07:42,336
太失我身份了
It's so embarrassingly bargain basement.

143
00:07:42,337 --> 00:07:46,334
你开玩笑嘛  外面那辆车很漂亮啊
Are you kidding? That bus out there, that's beautiful. That bus.

144
00:07:46,335 --> 00:07:48,973
-你真的喜欢吗  -是的  很喜欢
- Really, you like it? - Yes, I love it. It's bad ass.

145
00:07:48,974 --> 00:07:51,540
-够拉风吗  -灰常拉轰
- It's cool? - It's so cool.

146
00:07:51,541 --> 00:07:53,050
就像陆地上的飞机
It's like a land airplane.

147
00:07:53,051 --> 00:07:55,826
又省油  又环保
It's gas friendly, eco-friendly

148
00:07:55,827 --> 00:07:58,023
真应该给你颁个奥斯卡环保奖
You'll probably win and award for that shit.

149
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,661
-你怎么做到的  汉克  -做什么
- How do you do it, Hank? - Do what?

150
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:04,286
你爱的女人就在外面
The woman that you love is out there

151
00:08:04,287 --> 00:08:06,584
而且你知道你不能挽回她
and you know you can't have her.

152
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:10,049
你每天早上都怎么起来的
How do you get up in the morning?

153
00:08:11,225 --> 00:08:13,044
用酒呗
Booze is always helpful,

154
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:15,500
艺术也可以
so is the art.

155
00:08:17,147 --> 00:08:21,477
我写的东西都是关于她的  所以
Everything I write is either for her, or about her, so

156
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,109
我和她在一起  即使在我的作品里
I'm with her, even when I'm not,

157
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:26,176
我们没有
in my writting.

158
00:08:28,502 --> 00:08:30,292
真感人  汉克
That's very moving, Hank.

159
00:08:32,172 --> 00:08:34,604
-别哭  -为什么
- Don't cry! - Why?

160
00:08:34,745 --> 00:08:37,451
很不合适
It's unbecoming.

161
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:40,669
你说得这么感人  我为什么不能哭
You said something moving, why shouldn't I cry?

162
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:42,985
你身上那种澳洲人的坚韧品质呢
What about your aussie blockiness?

163
00:08:42,986 --> 00:08:46,826
或者英国人那种喜怒不形于色的品质呢
or your British stiff upper lip. Whatever the fuck you are.

164
00:08:47,138 --> 00:08:49,722
我觉得你应该跟我一起去  汉克
I think you should come on tour with me, Hank.

165
00:08:49,723 --> 00:08:52,767
我感觉如果我们完成了
I feel like if we finish our master piece,

166
00:08:53,193 --> 00:08:55,514
我们关于爱的摇滚音乐剧
our rock opera about love,

167
00:08:57,121 --> 00:08:59,413
也许我们都可以从女人中解脱了
maybe we'll both end up with the girl.

168
00:09:01,615 --> 00:09:03,225
我会考虑的
I'll think about it.

169
00:09:06,962 --> 00:09:08,230
还有
In the meantime.

170
00:09:08,403 --> 00:09:11,149
你是想摇滚呢还是漏鸟呢
Are you ready to rock out, or cock out?

171
00:09:32,096 --> 00:09:33,855
我必须承认这真的很酷
I'll admit this is pretty cool.

172
00:09:33,856 --> 00:09:36,340
就像每天都在迪斯尼乐园里样
It's like Disneyland every day.

173
00:09:36,341 --> 00:09:39,494
是啊  就是少了那些踩着踏板车的胖子
Yeah. Without the morbidly obese running around in scooters.

174
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:42,110
就连时间概念都不一样
Even the concept of time is different.

175
00:09:42,111 --> 00:09:46,988
这种演唱会一般都是在夏天开的
It's rock and roll fucking summer camp forever.

176
00:09:47,043 --> 00:09:50,441
-有时候该改改了  对吧  -谁说的
- It's got to end at some point, doesn't it? - Says who?

177
00:09:51,267 --> 00:09:53,693
最终还是要"落叶归根"的
All roads lead back home eventually.

178
00:09:55,023 --> 00:09:56,758
听起来像首乡村音乐
Sounds like a country song.

179
00:09:57,701 --> 00:10:00,020
你是费斯  对吧
Hey. You're Faith, right?

180
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:02,231
对  是我
Yeah, that's me.

181
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:05,109
我是文斯  谜团乐队的
I'm Vince, from Mysstery.

182
00:10:05,567 --> 00:10:07,958
两个S那个  我们今晚打头阵
Two s's. We're opening the show tonight.

183
00:10:07,959 --> 00:10:11,637
你好啊  两个S的谜团乐队的文斯
Well... Hey, Vince from Mistery with to s's.

184
00:10:11,638 --> 00:10:13,424
-祝你好运  -谢谢
- Good luck up there. - Cool, thanks.

185
00:10:13,425 --> 00:10:15,462
我想知道你是否愿意
I'm wondering if maybe

186
00:10:15,463 --> 00:10:17,324
去我们的车上看看
you wanted to come around to hang on our bus.

187
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:19,027
上面写有"猫俱乐部"的那辆
It's the one that says "Cat Club"

188
00:10:19,272 --> 00:10:22,117
之所以那么叫是因为每个想上来的小妞
We call it that because chicks who want to come on

189
00:10:22,118 --> 00:10:24,610
都会被我们要求在前门的垃圾桶里尿尿
we ask them to pee on this litter box we keep by the front door.

190
00:10:24,611 --> 00:10:28,284
这样我们就能知道她们是不是自愿来的
This way we know for sure that they're willing to party.

191
00:10:28,285 --> 00:10:30,163
我无所谓啊  我尿泡里都满了
I'm free, I got a full bladder.

192
00:10:30,164 --> 00:10:32,870
不过我想你还是不必来了
I don't think you'd have to do that, though,

193
00:10:32,871 --> 00:10:34,613
因为你太出名了
because you're pretty famous.

194
00:10:34,614 --> 00:10:37,887
谢谢你的热情邀请  但我不去  谢了
Thanks for the preferential treatment and all, no thanks

195
00:10:37,888 --> 00:10:41,032
怎么  我们车容纳不下传说中的费斯吗
What? We're not big enough for the legendary Faith?

196
00:10:41,033 --> 00:10:42,673
完全不是那样
No, it's not like that at all.

197
00:10:42,674 --> 00:10:44,124
但你非要找茬的话
But if you're going to be a dick about it,

198
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:45,497
那我直说好了
I might as well come clean.

199
00:10:45,498 --> 00:10:46,944
你们没那么有才
You're just not really that talented.

200
00:10:46,945 --> 00:10:47,701
我听过你们的专辑
I've heard your album and,

201
00:10:47,702 --> 00:10:49,469
跟商场里放的狗屁金属乐似的
it's really shitty mall metal.

202
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:51,551
换做是我的话就不折腾了
So, if I were you, I'd really just quit now,

203
00:10:51,552 --> 00:10:52,902
说不定今年夏天你们还能在
and maybe Hot Topic will hire you back

204
00:10:52,903 --> 00:10:54,058
{\an8}{\fn方正黑体简体\fs18\b1\bord1\shad1\3c&H2F2F2F&}Hot Topic是美国专注于
音乐  文化  服饰的连锁企业

205
00:10:52,903 --> 00:10:54,058
Hot Topic上火一把
this summer.

206
00:10:54,138 --> 00:10:56,375
你还挺贱的
Wow, you're kind of a bitch!

207
00:10:56,376 --> 00:10:59,712
嘴放干净点  怎么跟女士说话呢
Hey, watch your manners, son. That's no way to talk to a lady.

208
00:10:59,713 --> 00:11:01,066
滚开  老头
Fuck off, dad.

209
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:03,391
知道该怎么收拾他吗
You know what this calls for?

210
00:11:03,392 --> 00:11:04,478
掐奶龙爪手
Titty twister!

211
00:11:25,526 --> 00:11:27,955
晚上好  洛杉矶的朋友们
Good evening, Los Angeles!

212
00:11:28,189 --> 00:11:29,947
你们想看最棒的演出吗
You wanted the best?

213
00:11:30,141 --> 00:11:33,782
我可是一路堵车到这尼玛比弗利山庄的
Well I got stuck in the traffic coming on the fucking hill.

214
00:11:33,994 --> 00:11:36,581
途经火星  来自英国伦敦
From London, England, by way of Mars.

好运  不过你也不需要
Good luck out there. Not that you need it.

218
00:12:11,541 --> 00:12:14,486
你是摇滚明星
You're a fucking rock star.

219
00:12:49,499 --> 00:12:52,784
*我是你爱的奴隶*
*I'm a slave to your motherfucking love.*

220
00:12:53,497 --> 00:12:56,890
*可惜我却操了一个修女*
*It's a shame I've had a motherfucking nun.*

221
00:12:57,548 --> 00:13:00,741
*我是你爱的奴隶*
*I'm a slave to your motherfucking love.*

*向前一步  拿来*
*Step and fetch it.*

227
00:13:22,744 --> 00:13:24,695
这跟修女的斋戒生活差别很大吧
A long way from church, eh?

228
00:13:24,696 --> 00:13:26,108
这不废话吗
Are you kidding me?

229
00:13:27,763 --> 00:13:30,803

*Rock between the fire.*

234
00:13:53,783 --> 00:13:56,714
你这猥琐的臭光头
Do you, bald fucking wanker,

235
00:13:56,715 --> 00:14:00,665
愿意娶这位性感的树桩妹【啥】
take this sexy little tree stump,

236
00:14:00,666 --> 00:14:03,619
作为你毕生所爱吗
to be your immortal beloved?

237
00:14:03,955 --> 00:14:06,444
当然愿意这么做
I most certainly do.

00:14:06,727 --> 00:14:07,721
做
Do!

行了  而你这只跟我共享过
Right. And do you, delicious little spinner,

240
00:14:13,988 --> 00:14:16,382
一段缠绵的滚床单史
with whom I have shared a sexual encounter,

241
00:14:16,383 --> 00:14:19,738
能让我一直坚挺到人生巅峰的可人儿
which will sustain me well into my golden years,

242
00:14:19,739 --> 00:14:20,981
愿意接受这位
take this...

243

满身臭汗的无毛猪头
sweaty hairless pinhead

244
00:14:24,814 --> 00:14:28,815
作为你此生最后一位性伴侣吗
to be the very last sexual parter of you entire life?

245
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:30,167
我的天
Jesus!...

246
00:14:32,761 --> 00:14:34,904
既然你这么说的话
Well, when you put it like that...

247
00:14:36,272 --> 00:14:38,964
我们就这么干吧  干吧
Let's do it. I do it.

248
00:14:43,587 --> 00:14:47,180
很好  咱继续

Now, while we're here, does anyone else feel like getting wedded

253
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:16,878
美妙的洛杉矶之夜顺便结个婚

与我这个傻瓜共度余生
Spend the rest of your life with this fool,

260
00:15:41,249 --> 00:15:44,240
余生努力保证不让你后悔
the rest of his life making sure you don't regret it.

261
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:41,248
而我这个傻瓜会用
and this fool will spend

262
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:47,744
你看怎么样  宝贝儿
What do you say, babe?

263
00:15:48,295 --> 00:15:51,262
-说愿意  -你愿意成为我的妻子吗
- Say Yes! - Will you be my wife?

264
00:15:51,564 --> 00:15:53,066
快说愿意
Come on! Say yes!

265
00:15:58,577 --> 00:16:00,666
没人想吗
No? Nobody?

266
00:16:01,713 --> 00:16:02,751
真的吗
Really?

267
00:16:05,157 --> 00:16:10,086
那就快滚下台去  全部消失
Then get the fuck off my stage. Be gone, all of you!

268
00:16:14,516 --> 00:16:17,110
我写了下面这首歌献给我的妻子  娜塔莉
I wrote this next song for my wife, Natalie

269
00:16:17,111 --> 00:16:19,640
希望她能原谅我
in hope that she'll forgive me,

270
00:16:20,384 --> 00:16:20,951
就算她原谅了
although if she did,

271
00:16:20,952 --> 00:16:23,293
也许我还会再次捅出篓子
I'll probably just bugger it up all over again.

272
00:16:24,664 --> 00:16:25,545
但今晚我要为我的
But tonight I'm going to play it

273
00:16:25,546 --> 00:16:28,138
朋友和伙伴  汉克・穆迪演奏
for my good friend and collaborator,

274
00:16:28,139 --> 00:16:32,405
因为他也了解心碎的滋味
Hank Moody who knows a thing or two about heart break himself.

275
00:16:35,688 --> 00:16:40,713
*我从窗户的倒影里看到你在哭泣*
*I saw you're weeping as you're reflected in the window.*

276
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:42,273
*风里的爱情*
*Love above wind.*

277
00:16:42,649 --> 00:16:45,282
*在7点27分*
*Seven, twenty-seven.*

278
00:16:47,177 --> 00:16:52,760
*俯瞰这些城市  门襟越来越小*
*Look down at the cities, doors are slowly growing tiny.*

279
00:16:52,902 --> 00:16:57,873
*当夕阳把普通的厨房渲染成天堂*
*As the sunset turns house kitchen into heaven. *

280
00:16:59,729 --> 00:17:06,346
*你转过头  我把你的头发别在耳后*
*You turn your face to me and I tug your hair behind your ears.*

281
00:17:06,347 --> 00:17:09,365
*说一切都会安好*
*Say nothing can go wrong.*

282
00:17:09,514 --> 00:17:12,292
*只要我们在一起*
*So as long as we are together.*

283
00:17:12,293 --> 00:17:14,953
*只要我们在一起*
*So as long as we are.*

284
00:17:16,298 --> 00:17:19,843
*只要*
*So long...*

285
00:17:21,451 --> 00:17:24,438
*只要我们在一起*
*So as long as we are together.*

286
00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:26,328
*只要我们在一起*
*So as long as we are.*

287
00:17:26,329 --> 00:17:29,871

289

Thank you for coming to my fucking mother show.

290
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,735
Brian
Hi, Brian.

291
00:17:35,502 --> 00:17:37,542
实际上  你来了我还挺意外
Actually, I'm surprised that you came.

292
00:17:37,543 --> 00:17:40,531
有件事得澄清一下  之前是逗你玩的
I just want to make it clear, I was just fucking with you.

293
00:17:40,532 --> 00:17:42,810
我没给你女儿毒品
I did not give drugs to your daughter.

294
00:17:43,388 --> 00:17:45,254
因为我待会自己吸还不够呢
Because I need them for later.

295
00:17:45,255 --> 00:17:46,385
那孩子还好吗
But wait. How is the kid?

296
00:17:46,386 --> 00:17:48,247
-挺好的  -不错
- She's great. - Good.

297
00:17:48,248 --> 00:17:48,815
能麻烦你让他把阿提克斯
Would you get her to send me

298
00:17:48,816 --> 00:17:50,800
舔我蛋蛋的照片发给我吗
the picture of me tea-bagging Atticus?

299
00:17:50,801 --> 00:17:53,093
-没问题  -因为我想发到脸书上
- Will do. - Because I want to put that on my Facebook.

300
00:17:53,094 --> 00:17:54,119
成
Will do.

301
00:17:55,511 --> 00:17:58,474
你俩要不是一对的话  我就会尿你屁股里
Okay, and if you guys aren't together I'd pee in your butt.

302
00:17:58,475 --> 00:17:59,524
-啥  -麻烦把酒给我
- What?!  - Drink please.

303
00:18:01,409 --> 00:18:03,530
是贝卡打来的
It's Becca.

304
00:18:03,894 --> 00:18:06,554
-亲爱的  -嗨  老爸
- Hey sweetie. - Hi, dad.

305
00:18:06,555 --> 00:18:07,920
这一路上怎么样
How's the road treating you?

306
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:10,336
这里美极了  老爸
It's so beautiful out here, dad.

307
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,319
我现在生活如鱼得水
I'm having the time of my life.

308
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:16,259
-明天就去欧洲了 -真为你高兴
- And tomorrow we leave for Europe. - Glad to hear it.

309
00:18:17,201 --> 00:18:18,663
你开心吗  老爸
Are you happy, Dad?

310
00:18:19,204 --> 00:18:22,403
这个问题太沉重了
Tha...tha--that's a loaded question.

311
00:18:22,786 --> 00:18:24,062
我在思考我希望身边的人
I was just thinking about

312
00:18:24,063 --> 00:18:25,907
都能得到些什么
what I want for all the people in my life.

313
00:18:25,908 --> 00:18:28,334
结果我只想让你开心快乐
And I realized I just want you to be happy,

314
00:18:29,292 --> 00:18:31,820
想看到你发自内心的微笑
I want to see you smile and know you mean it.

315
00:18:33,845 --> 00:18:36,705
-你嗨了吧  -非常嗨
- Are you high right now? - Significantly.

316
00:18:37,056 --> 00:18:38,981
我们抽了超赞的大麻
We just smoked some killer weed.

317
00:18:38,982 --> 00:18:40,562
不出所料
Of course you did.

318
00:18:41,747 --> 00:18:43,798
当心点  甜心
Be careful, sweetie.

319
00:18:44,316 --> 00:18:47,159
玩尽兴  但也e嗨过头
And have fun, just not too much.

320
00:18:47,844 --> 00:18:49,159
不用担心  老爸
Don't worry, dad.

321
00:18:49,219 --> 00:18:51,328
条条都是回家的路
All roads lead back home.

322
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:53,588
感觉跟乡村歌曲似的
That sounds like a Country song.

323
00:18:54,926 --> 00:18:56,151
我爱你  老爸
I love you, dad.

324
00:18:56,689 --> 00:18:58,326
我也爱你  心肝儿
I love you too, sweetie.

325
00:18:59,327 --> 00:19:01,622
帮我个忙提克斯舔曼森蛋蛋的
Would you do me a favor and send Mason

326
00:19:01,623 --> 00:19:04,419
照片发给曼森吧
that photo of him tea-bagging Atticus.

327
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:06,504
行啊
Ok, will do.

328
00:19:06,505 --> 00:19:08,247
好  爱你  亲爱的
Ok, sweetie, I love you.

329
00:19:20,243 --> 00:19:21,391
我跟你一起去
I'm coming with you.

330
00:19:26,723 --> 00:19:29,257
这下我可高兴了
That makes me so very happy.

331
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:32,906
*我是*
*Oh and I'm...*

332
00:19:32,907 --> 00:19:36,164
*我是你甜蜜的负担*
*Is all the sweet misery*

333
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:40,761
*当你种下欲望之树*
*When you shape the tree of temptation.*

334
00:19:41,258 --> 00:19:43,253
*当我*
*Oh when I...*

335
00:19:43,863 --> 00:19:52,289
*我认识遗失在沮丧里的海滩上串脚印*
*I know the feet around the coast of paradise lost in frustration.*


336
00:19:53,798 --> 00:19:58,582
*爱的火焰还在燃烧*
*And the flame still burns.*

337
00:19:59,758 --> 00:20:05,272
*在我的灵魂里为未了的目标燃烧*
*It is there in my soul for the unfinished goal.*

338
00:20:05,273 --> 00:20:10,620
*爱的火焰还在燃烧*
*And the flame still burns.*

339
00:20:12,929 --> 00:20:15,820
挺好的  哥们儿  你做了正确的决定
Good for you, man. You made the right decision.

340
00:20:16,301 --> 00:20:17,666
再说了  你要真有那胆
Besides, if you actually had the balls

341
00:20:17,667 --> 00:20:19,596
跟她求婚  她也答应了
to do it, and she actually said yes,

342
00:20:19,818 --> 00:20:20,703
你又会怎么做
what would you have done?

343
00:20:20,704 --> 00:20:22,707
我会当场跟她结婚
I would've married her right there and then.

344
00:20:23,274 --> 00:20:23,824
然后什么
And then, what?

345
00:20:23,825 --> 00:20:25,305
你们先会跟兔子一样疯狂地干几天
You would have fucked like rabbits for a couple days,

346
00:20:25,306 --> 00:20:26,754
说些腻味的枕边话
you would have had some sweet pillow talk,

347
00:20:26,755 --> 00:20:27,655
接着某一天她就会
and then one day she would ask you

348
00:20:27,656 --> 00:20:29,044
{\an8}{\fn方正黑体简体\fs18\b1\bord1\shad1\3c&H2F2F2F&}美国家得宝公司
全球最大的家居建材零售商

349
00:20:27,656 --> 00:20:29,044
让你跟她一起去家得宝买东西
to go to Home Depot with her.

350
00:20:29,045 --> 00:20:30,254
你就玩儿完了
Party is over.

351
00:20:31,384 --> 00:20:32,713
你总高谈阔论游戏人生
You know, you talk a good game,

352
00:20:32,714 --> 00:20:34,115
但你死的时候我在场
but I was with you when you died,

353
00:20:34,116 --> 00:20:34,853
当时你正准备这么做
and you were about to do it.

354
00:20:34,854 --> 00:20:37,901
准备最后一次放手追逐此生挚爱  伙计
You were gonna take one last shot at the love of your life, buddy.

355
00:20:37,902 --> 00:20:39,148
是啊  我也许会尝试一下
Sure, I would have given it a try.

356
00:20:39,149 --> 00:20:41,221
也许还能跟她滚床单
Maybe I could have gotten her in the sack again.

357
00:20:41,222 --> 00:20:43,766
但最终  你起床后
But eventually, you get out of bed.

358
00:20:43,767 --> 00:20:44,857
依然本性难移
You're still you.

359
00:20:44,858 --> 00:20:47,669
一切的矛盾仍然在原地
All the problems you've ever had, they're still there.

360
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:50,049
所以就该放弃吗
So you're just supposed to give up?

361
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:52,064
不是放弃  而是放手
It's not about giving up. It's about letting go.

362
00:20:52,065 --> 00:20:55,110
诚然接受自己
Finally accepting who you are.

363
00:20:56,256 --> 00:20:57,306
猜猜是谁
Guess who.

364
00:21:00,529 --> 00:21:03,034
老天  我恨不得她赶快死了下来陪我
God, I can't wait for her to die and come down.

365
00:21:08,279 --> 00:21:09,311
凯伦
Karen?

366
00:21:13,082 --> 00:21:14,029
凯伦
Karen!

367
00:21:27,442 --> 00:21:29,309
你要回去了  对吗
You have to go, don't you?

368
00:21:31,101 --> 00:21:32,257
是的
Yeah, I do.

369
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:35,884
很抱歉  是的
I'm sorry, I do.

370
00:21:40,177 --> 00:21:41,291
别道歉
Don't be.

371
00:21:50,821 --> 00:21:52,971
你只是不知道自己会错过什么而已
You just don't know what you're going to be missing.

372
00:21:52,972 --> 00:21:54,115
我知道
I do.

373
00:21:55,064 --> 00:21:57,024
这正是分别如此艰难的原因
That's what makes it is so hard.

374
00:22:01,451 --> 00:22:03,905
-我真的可以好好爱你  -费斯
- I could love you, you know. - Faith...

375
00:22:03,906 --> 00:22:07,885
我不是说我现在爱你
I'm... I'm not saying that I do.

376
00:22:09,572 --> 00:22:12,626
我是说将来可以
I'm saying that I could.

377
00:22:14,311 --> 00:22:18,333
我很难动真情  所以有必要说出来
Which is rare for me, and deserves to be acknowledged.

378
00:22:19,663 --> 00:22:24,357
你比任何一个我交往过的男人都理解我
You understand me, better than any guy I've ever been.

379
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:26,920
你懂我
You get me.

380
00:22:29,044 --> 00:22:33,615
这种感觉最让人窝心
And that has been the nicest feeling.

381
00:22:38,461 --> 00:22:39,529
我是说
I'm just saying.

382
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:42,249
我是说你非常了不起
And I'm just saying that you're pretty fucking amazing.

383
00:22:43,433 --> 00:22:45,947
希望你能找到情投意合的那个他
I hope you find what you're looking for out here.

384
00:22:46,883 --> 00:22:49,434
希望你能追回情投意合的那个她
I hope you find what you're looking for out back there.

385
00:22:51,537 --> 00:22:53,271
我甚至会为你
I'll even say a prayer for you,

386
00:22:54,151 --> 00:22:57,546
小小地祈祷一下
just not a very big one.

387
00:22:59,531 --> 00:23:03,226
-讨厌跟你告别  -那就不要
- I hate saying goodbye to you. - Then don't.

388
00:23:04,709 --> 00:23:05,725
知道吗
You know what?

389
00:23:06,824 --> 00:23:10,046
从没真正在一起过的好处
The really great thing about never really being together:

390
00:23:11,097 --> 00:23:12,815
就是永远不会分手
never really have to break up.

391
00:23:15,079 --> 00:23:17,949
汉克  快走吧
Hank, get the fuck out of here.

392
00:23:18,637 --> 00:23:22,177
否则我就要把你夹在双腿间让你留下
Before I wrap my legs around you and convince you to stay.

393
00:23:22,749 --> 00:23:24,716
你知道这我不在话下
And you know I can do it.

394
00:23:53,937 --> 00:23:56,543
怎么回事  擦
What is this? What fuck, wow?

395
00:23:58,067 --> 00:24:00,571
-发生什么了  -汉克要走了
- What's going on? - Hank's got to go.

396
00:24:00,572 --> 00:24:02,516
他要去追回旧爱【求校】
He's got to see a horse about a girl.

397
00:24:03,484 --> 00:24:05,697
这是所谓追逐幸福吗
Is this about following your bliss?

398
00:24:06,858 --> 00:24:08,888
跟昨天我们在床上说的那些有关吗
Is this about what we talked in bed yesterday?

399
00:24:08,889 --> 00:24:12,112
-跟真爱有关吗  -是的
- Is it about love? - It is.

400
00:24:12,786 --> 00:24:13,933
那你必须得走
Then you must go.

401
00:24:15,795 --> 00:24:16,829
车不能为你调头
I can't turn the bus around,

402
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:19,011
但我能送你位幸福使者
but I cand send an emissary.

403
00:24:28,608 --> 00:24:30,528
抱歉  又哭了
Sorry, crying again.

404
00:24:30,529 --> 00:24:32,831
没关系  你哭得真难看
Don't be sorry. It's unbecoming.

405
00:24:36,136 --> 00:24:41,066
好了  快走吧  我的任务完成了
All right, you. Go. My work here is done.

406
00:24:44,575 --> 00:24:47,013
我知道你会一直幸福下去
I really see your happily ever after.

407

我知道他对你来说很重要
I know he means a great deal to you,

408
00:25:46,696 --> 00:25:48,043
对我也是
as he does to me.

409
00:25:48,767 --> 00:25:53,231
记住如果你需要的话  我会陪在你身旁
I just want you to know that I'm here for you, if you need me.

410
00:25:53,955 --> 00:25:55,229
情感上
Emotionally,

411
00:25:56,058 --> 00:25:57,342
精神上
spiritually,

412
00:25:57,895 --> 00:25:59,849
很明显生理上
and obviously sexually.

413
00:26:01,924 --> 00:26:03,242
谢了  阿提克斯
Thank you, Atticus.

414
00:26:03,438 --> 00:26:04,624
我是认真的  亲爱的
I'm serious, darling.

415
00:26:04,625 --> 00:26:07,812
有时性高潮可以缓解头痛
Sometimes and orgasm can relieve heartache.

416
00:26:07,813 --> 00:26:09,960
我可是做过许多调研的
I've done a lot of research in the area.

417
00:26:10,393 --> 00:26:11,570
至少来个好运之吻吧
Can I at least get a good luck kiss?

418
00:26:11,571 --> 00:26:13,591
晚上还有演出呢
I've got a gig tonight, you know,

419
00:26:13,612 --> 00:26:14,955
有点紧张呢
I'm a bit nervous.

420
00:26:58,339 --> 00:27:00,909
我知道你不是个爱矫情的人  克鲁尔
I know you're not one for emoting, Krull,

421
00:27:01,454 --> 00:27:02,530
但谢谢你
but thank you.

422
00:27:02,697 --> 00:27:04,264
我曾经爱过一个女孩
I had a girl once,

423
00:27:04,552 --> 00:27:06,286
曾以为是此生挚爱
love of my life she was.

424
00:27:06,735 --> 00:27:08,502
结果当然还是弄砸了
Fuck it up, of course.

425
00:27:09,439 --> 00:27:10,974
我以为我还有大把时间
I thought there'd be time.

426
00:27:11,927 --> 00:27:13,887
却发现  我有的只是脚下的路
Turns out, it's just roads,

427
00:27:14,930 --> 00:27:17,452
漫长又崎岖的路
long and paved potholes.

428
00:27:17,956 --> 00:27:19,794
这是我在书里读到的
I read that once in a book.

429
00:27:21,131 --> 00:27:22,651
去把她找回来吧  兄弟
Go and get her, pal
