Yes, sir. On my cellular.

Just one.

Worked sex crimes

saying he was gonna work late.

60
00:03:58,938 --> 00:04:00,713
Did he say what time
he'd be home?

61
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:05,318
No. He just said not to wait up.
I was used to that.

he had was his work.

Nothing. Just his prints
and his wife's.

00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:08,852
We emptied his desk and his locker.
We checked his notebooks.

00:05:08,908 --> 00:05:11,616
Whatever he was up to, he
didn't tell anybody about it.

Just answer the question, Mike.

98
00:06:01,494 --> 00:06:04,407
He worked sex crimes. That's
not exactly a gold mine, okay?

99
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:06,774
And before that he worked
narcotics at the 1-5.

a five-year-old Dodge.

102
00:06:13,072 --> 00:06:14,517
When was the last time
you talked to him?

103
00:06:15,408 --> 00:06:17,547
Couple of weeks ago.
He called me.

104
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:19,283
Just like that,
out of the blue?

105
00:06:19,345 --> 00:06:21,882
Yeah, just like that. He found
the cure for the common cold.

106
00:06:21,948 --> 00:06:25,657
Look, I was busy. We talked maybe a
couple of minutes. It was a nothing call.

107
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:29,333
What's going on here? Was Morino
under investigation or what?

108
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,665
We're talking to anybody who
ever hung a coat at the 1-5.

Well, does that
include their friends?

never heard of Dale Carnegie.

113

Look, I've been to Morino's house
a couple of times a year. Okay?

I never saw anything
that made me think twice.

Because it's about to
hit the fan at the 1-5.

118
00:06:55,681 --> 00:06:58,025
Maybe somebody thought
Morino'd be a liability.

119
00:07:00,386 --> 00:07:02,297
Are you saying
another cop whacked him?

anything's possible.

Internal Affairs get into it, huh?

Well, they would like that. But
I can tell them to take a hike.

124

Now, listen, here's a list of the
people we're looking at, at the 1-5.

125
00:07:21,908 --> 00:07:25,219
Any of those names come up in connection
with Morino, you let me know.

126
00:07:25,711 --> 00:07:28,715
And Mikey, this could
get hot and heavy.

127
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:31,658
So you keep that famous temper
of yours in your pocket, huh?

00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:33,619
See you.

129
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:35,364
This is a waste of time.

130
00:07:35,721 --> 00:07:38,759
If Morino was having lunch with
the old gang from the 1-5,

131
00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:41,203
he wouldn't be stupid enough
to put it in his date book.

132
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:43,038
He would've been stupid not to.

133
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:44,938
If I was being squeezed
by those slime balls

134
00:07:44,997 --> 00:07:46,908
I would have made
a note of it in big letters.

135
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,539
Unless he had as much
to hide as they do.

136
00:07:49,702 --> 00:07:52,546
Hey, Lennie, for the last
time, Morino was clean.

137
00:07:52,905 --> 00:07:53,975
Got it.

138
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:56,781
I don't get this.

139
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:01,725
Morino's precinct command log
for the last month.

140
00:08:01,848 --> 00:08:04,226
Three times, he called in
off duty to Riverside Park.

141
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,430
So he was either
crazy about the neighborhood,

142
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,159
or he had something
going on the side.

143
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:11,964
What on the side? Come on,
just spit it out. Hey, Mike.

144
00:08:12,191 --> 00:08:13,864
You want to write
Morino's eulogy,

145
00:08:13,926 --> 00:08:15,337
or you want to catch
the guy who killed him?

146
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:17,834
Let's talk to the wife.

147
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:22,676
Billy never talked about
what went on at the 1-5.

148
00:08:24,203 --> 00:08:25,978
I know he wasn't happy there.

149
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,645
Maybe some familiar names
came up over dinner?

150
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:33,446
No. He never
mentioned anybody.

151
00:08:34,547 --> 00:08:37,960
Judy, we noticed he was around
Riverside Park a few times last month,

152
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:40,122
but his partner said
it wasn't work-related.

153
00:08:40,753 --> 00:08:44,667
On the West Side? We don't
have any friends over there.

154
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:47,933
(CLEARS THROAT) Maybe your
husband had a friend.

155
00:08:51,497 --> 00:08:52,567
Now, look...

156
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:58,881
We're gonna have to ask you this.
How was it going between you two?

157
00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:05,184
Fine. Considering
we were married 15 years.

158
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:08,558
You know, Billy had his moods.

159
00:09:08,614 --> 00:09:10,287
What kind of mood lately?

160
00:09:12,451 --> 00:09:15,591
Most nights he was up pacing.
He was having nightmares.

161
00:09:17,123 --> 00:09:21,071
I thought it was because of his work, you
know, the kind of cases he was getting.

162
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:23,271
Really sick stuff.

163
00:09:25,464 --> 00:09:29,207
The department has shrinks on the payroll.
Could he have been talking to any of them?

164
00:09:29,502 --> 00:09:30,537
I don't know.

165
00:09:31,704 --> 00:09:34,014
I think he was talking to
somebody else, though.

166
00:09:34,974 --> 00:09:36,214
I took a message for him

167
00:09:36,275 --> 00:09:40,314
about three weeks ago
from a Father Joe.

168
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:44,454
You know Billy went back to the
church after the kids started school.

169
00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:47,059
He wanted me to convert, too.

170
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:50,367
Are you talking
about a Father Joe Krolinsky?

171
00:09:50,856 --> 00:09:52,836
Yeah. You know him?

172
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:54,361
Yeah.

173
00:09:55,728 --> 00:09:59,141
He was our parish priest
when Billy and I were kids.

174
00:09:59,198 --> 00:10:00,404
Did he leave a number?

175
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,110
No. He said he'd
try Billy at work.

176
00:10:04,303 --> 00:10:06,146
I was just glad
he was getting help.

177
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:14,681
K-R-Jo.-I-I-N-S-K-Y.
Krolinsky.

178
00:10:15,481 --> 00:10:16,789
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)

179
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:18,888
Joseph.

180
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:21,697
No, we already checked Queens.

181
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:26,968
Okay. Thank you.

182
00:10:29,161 --> 00:10:31,232
Archdiocese doesn't have him.

183
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:32,537
Yes?

184
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:36,311
All right.
Thank you very much, Sister.

185
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:39,714
He's not pounding the pulpit
in New Jersey, either.

186
00:10:40,239 --> 00:10:41,877
What do you want to do,
call the Pope?

187
00:10:41,941 --> 00:10:43,545
Gonna start with the DMV.

188
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:46,388
What? Priests don't drive?

189
00:10:47,747 --> 00:10:50,057
Yes, this is
Detective Briscoe of the 2-7.

190
00:10:50,116 --> 00:10:53,325
The color of the day
is aquamarine.

191
00:10:54,954 --> 00:10:58,959
Right, I need an address on
a Joseph Krolinsky, with a

192
00:10:59,725 --> 00:11:02,365
No, no date of birth.
Start with the locals.

193
00:11:04,096 --> 00:11:05,097
Uh-huh.

194
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:07,739
Say that one again.

195
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:13,176
Thank you very much.
We have a winner.

196
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:16,413
Joseph Krolinsky,
406 West 78th.

197
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:21,149
That'd be two blocks
from where Morino was shot.

198
00:11:23,115 --> 00:11:24,526
It's good to
see you again, Mike.

199
00:11:25,151 --> 00:11:26,494
Can I offer you some coffee?

200
00:11:26,552 --> 00:11:27,860
We're okay, Father.

201
00:11:28,387 --> 00:11:30,867
The only people who call me
that are my kids.

202
00:11:31,424 --> 00:11:33,700
I haven't been a priest
in nearly 15 years.

203
00:11:35,594 --> 00:11:36,629
Do you have a family?

204
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:37,766
No.

205
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:40,776
Well, don't wait too long.
I nearly did.

206
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:45,281
And I take it you're not
here for a social call.

207
00:11:46,972 --> 00:11:48,918
You phoned Billy Morino
a couple of weeks ago.

208
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,346
That's right.

209
00:11:51,143 --> 00:11:52,315
Why the sudden inspiration?

210
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:53,448
JOE: He called me.

211
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:58,493
My company transferred me here last year.
I ran into Bill's mother on the subway.

212
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:00,053
I used to counsel her
when I was a priest.

213
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,891
Anyway, she told me
how well Bill was doing.

214
00:12:03,589 --> 00:12:05,193
Thought I'd like to
hear from him.

215
00:12:05,257 --> 00:12:07,134
Did you?
Of course.

216
00:12:08,127 --> 00:12:10,573
But I haven't talked to him.
We traded phone calls.

217
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:11,630
Why, what happened?

218
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:17,013
Detective Morino was killed Tuesday night,
a couple of blocks from here in the park.

219
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:19,080
Oh, my God.

220
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:23,118
Did he ever come by the house,
maybe when you were out?

221
00:12:23,542 --> 00:12:26,989
No. My wife
would've told me.

222
00:12:28,147 --> 00:12:29,285
KATE: Joe.

223
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:31,321
The kids want to
say good night.

224
00:12:31,383 --> 00:12:32,589
I'll be right there.

225
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,626
You'll excuse me.

226
00:12:35,688 --> 00:12:37,099
BRISCOE: Yeah.
Sure, go ahead.

227
00:12:37,857 --> 00:12:40,929
One more thing, Father.
Where were you Tuesday night?

228
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:46,202
I was right here with my family.
Why? Am I a suspect?

229
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:48,036
It was just a question.

230
00:12:53,072 --> 00:12:55,609
Father Joe was in charge
of the altar boys.

231
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:58,782
He...

232
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:02,990
He had a reputation...

233
00:13:03,048 --> 00:13:04,686
And?

234
00:13:07,853 --> 00:13:09,059
Look, I...

235
00:13:11,423 --> 00:13:13,630
I haven't even told
Lennie about this.

236
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:19,606
Father Joe put
the moves on me once.

237
00:13:25,871 --> 00:13:28,408
Billy had some involvement,
some of the other kids, too.

238
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:30,611
What? Nobody reported him?

239
00:13:30,943 --> 00:13:35,756
No, we were just kids. I mean, he was a big deal.
Our parents loved him.

240
00:13:36,615 --> 00:13:38,754
What are kids gonna do
against a parish priest?

241
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:40,659
CRAGEN:
What're we saying here?

242
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:46,628
Morino heard Krolinsky's back in town.
He knows he likes kids.

243
00:13:47,293 --> 00:13:49,933
Then what?
Fill in the blanks, Mike.

244
00:13:51,096 --> 00:13:52,200
I can't.

245
00:13:59,905 --> 00:14:02,442
Look, Mike, I'm here for you,
and you know that.

246
00:14:03,108 --> 00:14:06,146
But you are gonna have to bring
in Lennie and Van Buren, okay?

247
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:09,650
Now, what does this
Krolinsky do for a living?

248
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:12,788
Senior Accounts Supervisor
at Dominion Life.

249
00:14:13,152 --> 00:14:17,567
He's got the package deal. Nice
job, nice home, nice family.

250
00:14:18,624 --> 00:14:22,629
So it'd be a shame if somebody were to
come along and upset that apple cart?

251
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:27,010
Especially if that somebody
had their hand out.

252
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:36,478
We checked Krolinsky's IUDs.

253
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:40,217
Two calls from his office, one call
to Morino, one call to his precinct.

254
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:42,816
And no calls to Krolinsky
on Morino's IUDs.

255
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:45,055
It bears out what
Krolinsky told you.

256
00:14:45,117 --> 00:14:49,395
Well, don't put him up for sainthood yet.
Because I called up his yellows.

257
00:14:49,455 --> 00:14:53,198
One arrest in '68, third-degree sexual abuse.
No disposition.

258
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:56,866
Sex abuse three. Catch-all for
everything, including a pat on the ass.

259
00:14:56,962 --> 00:14:58,441
Anything more recent?

260
00:14:58,497 --> 00:15:00,738
Well, no.

261
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:04,007
We got...
The archdiocese sent us stats.

262
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:06,606
1969, he was assigned to
a parish in Ohio.

263
00:15:06,672 --> 00:15:09,949
Then five more parishes
over the next 12 years.

264
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:11,850
Last parish was in Buffalo.

265
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:15,058
Two years later, he hangs up his
collar and moves to Jersey.

266
00:15:15,447 --> 00:15:17,654
According to the computer,
he kept his nose clean.

267
00:15:17,716 --> 00:15:20,322
So this reputation
could've been all talk.

268
00:15:21,654 --> 00:15:24,794
Hey, I was there. I didn't imagine
it and neither did Morino.

269
00:15:24,857 --> 00:15:26,996
He was in Krolinsky's
neighborhood for a reason.

270
00:15:27,126 --> 00:15:28,901
Because of Krolinsky.

271
00:15:28,961 --> 00:15:30,736
Yeah, but he's
not around to tell us.

272
00:15:33,966 --> 00:15:36,276
Maybe he told some of the
others from the old parish.

273
00:15:37,236 --> 00:15:40,706
He called me before he died.
Maybe he called them.

274
00:15:45,511 --> 00:15:48,117
Even after he said his name, it took
me a while to make the connection.

275
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:49,957
Billy Boy Morino.

276
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:53,123
First kid on the block
to grow a mustache.

277
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:56,896
I don't hear squat from him in 20 years,
and all of a sudden he wants a sit-down.

278
00:15:57,823 --> 00:16:01,532
Right off the bat,
he gets into it. Father Joe.

279
00:16:02,094 --> 00:16:03,869
One name I had
no problem remembering.

280
00:16:03,929 --> 00:16:05,067
Why is that?

281
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:09,711
Come on, Mike. You know
what I'm talking about.

282
00:16:11,737 --> 00:16:12,841
Pretend I don't.

283
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:18,149
Father Joe molested me
when I was 11.

284
00:16:18,344 --> 00:16:21,689
A lot of other kids, too.
Billy was pretty worked up.

285
00:16:22,381 --> 00:16:24,327
Said we should do something
about what he did to us.

286
00:16:24,616 --> 00:16:26,459
Take him to court, sue him.

287
00:16:26,518 --> 00:16:28,623
That might not be a bad idea.

288
00:16:29,221 --> 00:16:31,098
It happened
a long time ago, Mike.

289
00:16:31,557 --> 00:16:33,696
I had some problems in my
marriage, but I got help.

290
00:16:34,293 --> 00:16:38,742
I settled up with Father Joe in my head.
I told Billy that's all I needed to do.

291
00:16:39,865 --> 00:16:43,642
I can't get over it. I just talked
to him a couple of weeks ago.

292
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:46,817
Yeah. Well, getting back to that
conversation, Mr. Scully...

293
00:16:46,872 --> 00:16:49,318
It was about that
sick bastard, Father Joe,

294
00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:52,316
whatever he calls himself
these days.

295
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:54,788
Morino said he'd been
keeping tabs on him.

296
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,053
Meaning what?

297
00:16:56,615 --> 00:16:59,221
Meaning Morino's in the
business of busting perverts.

298
00:16:59,952 --> 00:17:02,125
Father Joe certainly qualifies.

299
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:04,189
Billy said he wanted
to take him to court.

300
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:06,592
He told me he had
a talk with Father Joe.

301
00:17:08,293 --> 00:17:10,603
Son of a bitch offered him
money to go away.

302
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:13,934
Billy asked me
what I thought about it.

303
00:17:13,999 --> 00:17:15,137
Well, what did you think?

304
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:16,870
Told him I'd get back to him.

305
00:17:16,935 --> 00:17:18,573
I already know what
I want to do to Father Joe,

306
00:17:18,637 --> 00:17:20,310
taking his money
isn't part of it.

307
00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:24,920
Now that we got the death penalty
back, I know who's got my vote

308
00:17:24,977 --> 00:17:26,081
for the grand opening.

309
00:17:26,145 --> 00:17:27,624
Hey, you want to
get even with Krolinsky,

310
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:30,387
put him in the shower room
at Ossining for five minutes.

311
00:17:30,449 --> 00:17:32,224
Yeah, it's Logan.

312
00:17:32,584 --> 00:17:33,756
You beeped me.

313
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:39,164
Anyway, it sounds like Morino was
looking for a more rewarding payback.

314
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:41,932
Krolinsky offered him the money. I
didn't hear that Billy took it.

315
00:17:41,994 --> 00:17:43,439
Well, maybe he never
got the chance.

316
00:17:43,695 --> 00:17:46,835
Maybe Krolinsky figured he's gonna
be on the hook to this guy forever.

317
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,879
And he solves his problems
with one bullet.

318
00:17:48,934 --> 00:17:52,006
Yeah, where? Okay.

319
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:54,183
Speaking of, they got the slug.

320
00:17:55,874 --> 00:17:58,320
CSU found it on the ground
with a metal detector.

321
00:17:58,377 --> 00:18:00,721
70 yards from where
Morino was shot.

322
00:18:00,779 --> 00:18:02,781
We're lucky it didn't
catch the uptown bus.

323
00:18:02,848 --> 00:18:04,725
A .38 semi-wad cutter.

324
00:18:04,783 --> 00:18:06,228
Are you ready for this?

325
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:10,490
I matched it to Morino's service revolver.
We had his lands and grooves on file.

326
00:18:10,556 --> 00:18:11,864
That can't be right.

327
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:14,063
There's the microscope.
Help yourself.

328
00:18:15,127 --> 00:18:18,506
Did anybody check Morino's
gloves for powder residue?

329
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:19,668
Let me look.

330
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:24,747
The answer's no. The
gloves were in his pocket.

331
00:18:26,138 --> 00:18:28,448
Well, just for the hell of it,
check them anyway.

332
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:36,389
You read our report. It's all
there in black and white.

333
00:18:36,715 --> 00:18:37,887
Well, my reading skills aren't

334
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,191
what they used to be. Why
don't you walk us through it?

335
00:18:41,753 --> 00:18:43,960
We came down the hill,
found him lying there.

336
00:18:44,723 --> 00:18:46,703
His gloves,
were they on or off?

337
00:18:47,593 --> 00:18:49,903
He wasn't wearing any.
They were in his pocket.

338
00:18:50,696 --> 00:18:54,872
We can't figure out how powder
residue got on his right glove.

339
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:59,605
It's all here in the report,
fellows, in black and white.

340
00:19:00,205 --> 00:19:01,240
(SIGHING)

341
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:02,944
Those lab guys are amazing.

342
00:19:03,775 --> 00:19:06,517
They found a slug and matched
it up to Morino's piece.

343
00:19:07,246 --> 00:19:12,218
Now either they're wrong, or your report
isn't what I would call comprehensive.

344
00:19:12,417 --> 00:19:15,455
Maybe you'd like to
pencil in a few adjustments?

345
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:21,126
Look, we were just trying to
do right by the guy's family.

346
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:26,066
Just try doing right
by regulations.

347
00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:30,839
We found him with his service
piece in his right hand.

348
00:19:30,903 --> 00:19:35,545
He was a suicide, no question. We
ditched the gun, took his gloves off.

349
00:19:37,142 --> 00:19:40,248
What in hell crossed your mind
to do something like that?

350
00:19:40,579 --> 00:19:43,389
He goes on the books as a
suicide, the widow gets what,

351
00:19:43,749 --> 00:19:45,558
a lousy 50 grand payout?

352
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:48,592
If he gets written up as
"killed in the line of duty,"

353
00:19:48,654 --> 00:19:50,600
it rates a couple of
hundred grand, minimum.

354
00:19:50,923 --> 00:19:54,370
Yeah, I mean, come on,
guys, he was a cop.

355
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,271
We gotta take care of
each other, am I right?

356
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:04,813
I talked to McCoy. We won't be
pressing charges against the officers.

357
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:08,517
The department'll handle it. At most,
they'll draw a 30-day suspension.

358
00:20:08,574 --> 00:20:11,748
Great. They can use the time to raise
money for the widows and orphans' fund.

359
00:20:12,077 --> 00:20:14,387
I don't get it.
Billy just wasn't the type.

360
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:18,455
Yeah, well, we'll save the
post-game wrap-up for the shrinks.

361
00:20:18,517 --> 00:20:19,825
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

362
00:20:19,985 --> 00:20:22,727
We talked to four people who
were molested by Krolinsky.

363
00:20:22,955 --> 00:20:24,332
And those are just
the ones we know about.

364
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:26,198
Thirty-year-old crimes, Mike.

365
00:20:26,258 --> 00:20:28,363
That's 25 years
past the expiration date.

366
00:20:28,427 --> 00:20:29,599
He left the state.

367
00:20:29,661 --> 00:20:32,164
Doesn't that stop the clock
on the statute of limitations?

368
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:34,677
Only for five years.
Krolinsky's in the clear.

369
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:35,905
And Morino might be dead

370
00:20:35,968 --> 00:20:37,879
because of what he did to him.
You're gonna let him walk?

371
00:20:38,837 --> 00:20:42,216
We don't have a choice.
His record's clean.

372
00:20:42,274 --> 00:20:44,652
Except for a sex abuse
arrest in '68.

373
00:20:45,043 --> 00:20:46,750
Which was never prosecuted.

374
00:20:46,812 --> 00:20:48,792
Claire, the guy
belongs in a box.

375
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:57,761
You know what, Mike? Talk to the sex-abuse victim.
Find out what really happened.

376
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,998
I was 10 years old.

377
00:21:04,796 --> 00:21:08,175
My dad sold plumbing supplies
so he was on the road a lot.

378
00:21:09,401 --> 00:21:11,278
Father Joe picked up
the slack, you know.

379
00:21:12,838 --> 00:21:14,078
And he got me into the choir.

380
00:21:14,139 --> 00:21:15,743
He helped me with my
homework, stuff like that.

381
00:21:18,343 --> 00:21:20,653
My mother thought
he walked on water.

382
00:21:20,712 --> 00:21:22,817
She didn't catch on, right?

383
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:27,158
Nah. Neither did I.

384
00:21:29,254 --> 00:21:31,666
It wasn't like he was sending
a dozen roses every day.

385
00:21:32,858 --> 00:21:34,963
Well, after the big build-up,
what happened?

386
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:40,465
(CLEARS THROAT)

387
00:21:43,235 --> 00:21:46,341
He asked me to stay after
choir practice one Saturday.

388
00:21:47,239 --> 00:21:49,014
It was this little room
at the school.

389
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:53,986
He started asking me
a lot of questions like,

390
00:21:55,647 --> 00:22:00,221
you know, did I have a girlfriend.
And they got more and more personal,

391
00:22:00,285 --> 00:22:02,731
and then it was, "Show me yours
and I'll show you mine."

392
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:09,061
It's okay, Mr. Waller.
You're doing just fine.

393
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:13,165
(CLEARS THROAT)

394
00:22:16,868 --> 00:22:18,370
He put his hand in my pants.

395
00:22:20,706 --> 00:22:22,743
Gray flannel pants
I got for Christmas.

396
00:22:26,578 --> 00:22:28,216
And when it was over, he...

397
00:22:32,384 --> 00:22:34,330
He made a mess on my new pants.

398
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:38,857
(EXHALES)

399
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:44,200
He started crying and he said that
we'd sinned and if I told anybody,

400
00:22:44,262 --> 00:22:46,105
God would punish both of us.

401
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,211
But you did tell somebody?

402
00:22:50,268 --> 00:22:51,713
Because of the pants.

403
00:22:53,638 --> 00:22:55,948
I hid them in the basement,
and my dad found them.

404
00:22:56,308 --> 00:22:59,517
At that time, did you tell the
police what you just told us?

405
00:23:01,246 --> 00:23:02,418
No.

406
00:23:04,149 --> 00:23:08,097
My mother was very pious.
She burned the pants.

407
00:23:09,955 --> 00:23:11,628
My father wanted to kill him.

408
00:23:13,425 --> 00:23:14,927
And they had a big argument.

409
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:18,504
And I was told that
all I was allowed to say was,

410
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:20,565
Father Joe touched me
through my clothes.

411
00:23:21,967 --> 00:23:23,446
And what happened
after he got arrested?

412
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:25,070
(SCOFFS)

413
00:23:27,005 --> 00:23:31,818
You know, I'm really not sure.
Man, I was young.

414
00:23:34,346 --> 00:23:37,759
Father Joe left the parish, and my
parents never brought it up again.

415
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:43,631
I was a happy kid.

416
00:23:46,057 --> 00:23:47,798
And I loved my parents.

417
00:23:51,463 --> 00:23:53,636
That scum took
all that away from me.

418
00:23:56,968 --> 00:23:58,345
So the man's a criminal.

419
00:23:58,637 --> 00:24:01,379
How does that get us past
the statute of limitations?

420
00:24:01,573 --> 00:24:04,520
We can re-file the charge as a felony
and still be within the limits.

421
00:24:04,576 --> 00:24:06,249
He was charged with
a misdemeanor.

422
00:24:06,478 --> 00:24:09,220
Only because the police were never
told what actually happened.

423
00:24:09,314 --> 00:24:11,021
You know it's a stretch.

424
00:24:11,082 --> 00:24:13,722
Jack, Mr. Waller never
had his day in court.

425
00:24:19,491 --> 00:24:20,868
Pick up Krolinsky.

426
00:24:22,894 --> 00:24:24,032
Mike, what's going on?

427
00:24:24,095 --> 00:24:25,938
You mind stepping outside,
Mr. Krolinsky?

428
00:24:27,332 --> 00:24:30,541
Joseph Krolinsky, you're under
arrest for aggravated sexual abuse.

429
00:24:30,602 --> 00:24:31,910
You have the right
to remain silent.

430
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:34,644
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

431
00:24:34,706 --> 00:24:35,741
Joe?
You understand that?

432
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:37,150
Get back inside, Kate.

433
00:24:37,209 --> 00:24:39,815
You have the right to an attorney. If
you cannot afford one, one will be...

434
00:24:42,247 --> 00:24:46,252
Thirty-year-old misdemeanor, and you
puff it up into a felony arrest.

435
00:24:46,618 --> 00:24:49,599
He's lucky the statutes keep
me from bringing more charges.

436
00:24:49,754 --> 00:24:53,099
Based on what? Stewart
Waller's book of fairy-tales?

437
00:24:53,258 --> 00:24:55,033
They believed him 30 years ago.

438
00:24:55,093 --> 00:24:59,166
And they didn't prosecute because
they saw it for what it was,

439
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:01,637
the imaginings of
a vindictive child.

440
00:25:01,733 --> 00:25:03,576
I told Stewart he couldn't be

441
00:25:03,635 --> 00:25:06,138
in the choir anymore.
He wasn't good enough.

442
00:25:06,605 --> 00:25:09,586
He ran home and told his
parents this crazy story.

443
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:13,349
A lot of other people tell similar stories.
Are they all being vindictive?

444
00:25:13,411 --> 00:25:16,255
Neighborhood gossip.
That's your case?

445
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:22,088
Let me spare you the egg facial.
Motion to dismiss.

446
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:24,959
Pleasant reading.

447
00:25:28,927 --> 00:25:31,771
Even if you attach credence
to Mr. Waller's accusations,

448
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:34,640
the boat sailed
25 years ago, Your Honor.

449
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:37,942
The People are doing an end run
around the statute of limitations.

450
00:25:38,003 --> 00:25:41,473
Mr. McCoy, this offense was filed as a
misdemeanor when I was in high school.

451
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,315
Why bring it back
as a felony now?

452
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:45,719
We believe it's only
the tip of the iceberg.

453
00:25:45,777 --> 00:25:50,351
That's nonsense. This case sat in
someone's drawer for 30 years.

454
00:25:50,415 --> 00:25:51,985
It was dismissed once.

455
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:53,924
To let Mr. McCoy proceed now

456
00:25:54,019 --> 00:25:56,863
not only violates the spirit
of the statute of limitations,

457
00:25:56,922 --> 00:25:59,095
it violates my client's
right to a speedy trial.

458
00:25:59,157 --> 00:26:02,866
He violated Stewart Waller in the
most heinous manner imaginable.

459
00:26:03,028 --> 00:26:06,032
The People had their bite at the
apple 30 years ago, Mr. McCoy.

460
00:26:06,531 --> 00:26:09,842
I don't see how stretching the statute
serves the interest of justice.

461
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:12,646
The charges are dismissed.

462
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:15,245
Well, it was a noble effort.

463
00:26:16,441 --> 00:26:20,548
I called Stewart Waller to tell him.
It wasn't easy. He had his hopes up.

464
00:26:20,612 --> 00:26:21,955
He's suffered plenty.

465
00:26:23,014 --> 00:26:25,324
The statute of limitations
doesn't help him.

466
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:28,724
Long as Mr. Krolinsky's been
behaving himself all these years.

467
00:26:29,154 --> 00:26:30,565
He just hasn't been caught.

468
00:26:31,323 --> 00:26:35,772
I've prosecuted pedophiles before, Adam.
They defy rehabilitation.

469
00:26:35,827 --> 00:26:39,866
Even golfers retire. Is there any
evidence that he's still active?

470
00:26:40,065 --> 00:26:43,979
No. But he moved from parish
to parish the last 30 years.

471
00:26:44,736 --> 00:26:46,215
Makes you wonder why.

472
00:26:46,538 --> 00:26:48,279
Let's ask the people
who moved him.

473
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:59,751
I pulled together Mr. Krolinsky's
personnel file, works and all.

474
00:26:59,918 --> 00:27:03,991
It doesn't say very much for our
success in dealing with his problem.

475
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:06,598
The church knew
what he was doing?

476
00:27:06,758 --> 00:27:11,298
Yes. We had reports from other priests,
from parents, starting in the late '60s.

477
00:27:11,363 --> 00:27:13,400
Well, what were you
waiting for? Polaroids?

478
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:16,742
Of course not. Mr. Krolinsky
was relieved of his duties.

479
00:27:16,868 --> 00:27:18,973
He was ordered to seek
medical care.

480
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:23,108
Once the doctors pronounced him
cured, he was sent to a new parish.

481
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:25,379
How often was he
pronounced cured?

482
00:27:25,543 --> 00:27:29,992
The church tried everything, Mr. McCoy.
We sent him to our treatment centers.

483
00:27:30,081 --> 00:27:33,358
We thought faith and prayer would
be enough to rehabilitate him.

484
00:27:33,418 --> 00:27:34,522
We were wrong.

485
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:36,730
The church had him
for 20 years.

486
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:41,835
I'm amazed you allowed him to slip
through the cracks for so long.

487
00:27:44,129 --> 00:27:46,575
We dealt with him
as best we could,

488
00:27:46,631 --> 00:27:49,612
based on what we knew then
about his sickness.

489
00:27:50,635 --> 00:27:54,640
Now we put people like
Mr. Krolinsky in your hands.

490
00:27:56,641 --> 00:28:00,145
It's incredible. There must be 100
reports of molestation in here.

491
00:28:01,312 --> 00:28:03,815
And only one of them
ends up on a police blotter.

492
00:28:06,051 --> 00:28:10,295
When Krolinsky was sent to a
parish in Buffalo in 1980,

493
00:28:10,388 --> 00:28:14,302
nobody even bothered to warn them. They
made him supervisor of the altar boys.

494
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:20,434
Krolinsky's last documented victims were in '81.
Still puts him out of our range.

495
00:28:23,001 --> 00:28:26,210
Hand me the police interviews
with Detective Morino's friends.

496
00:28:29,941 --> 00:28:34,287
One of them mentions a conversation
between Krolinsky and Morino.

497
00:28:38,583 --> 00:28:39,687
Here.

498
00:28:42,921 --> 00:28:45,197
Krolinsky offered him money
to leave him alone.

499
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:47,367
And Morino was
a police officer.

500
00:28:47,826 --> 00:28:50,705
Do you want to arrest Krolinsky
for attempted bribery?

501
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:54,968
Say money did change hands. Bribery
is an element of a conspiracy.

502
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:57,569
A conspiracy to do what?

503
00:28:57,635 --> 00:28:59,012
To molest children.

504
00:29:00,105 --> 00:29:03,416
It extends from the time he
molested the kids in the '60s,

505
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:05,751
right up to the present
where he bribed Morino.

506
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:07,289
We can get him for everything.

507
00:29:08,046 --> 00:29:11,425
It takes two to commit conspiracy.
Who did he conspire with?

508
00:29:13,618 --> 00:29:15,029
The Roman Catholic Church.

509
00:29:16,154 --> 00:29:17,599
What've you been inhaling?

510
00:29:18,123 --> 00:29:20,569
You want to name the Catholic
Church as a co-conspirator?

511
00:29:20,625 --> 00:29:23,071
An unindicted co-conspirator.
I see.

512
00:29:23,862 --> 00:29:27,674
We don't charge them with conspiring
to molest kids, we just say they did.

513
00:29:28,166 --> 00:29:30,077
That's gonna be a great
relief to the Archbishop.

514
00:29:30,135 --> 00:29:31,808
We don't even
have to go that far.

515
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:34,716
Under People v. Villetto,
we can convict Krolinsky

516
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:37,253
even though the church never
intended to conspire with him,

517
00:29:37,308 --> 00:29:38,719
nor commit
the underlying crime.

518
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:39,847
That's very slick.

519
00:29:40,378 --> 00:29:43,359
But you still need an overt
act by the co-conspirator.

520
00:29:43,414 --> 00:29:45,451
The church played a shell game
with Krolinsky.

521
00:29:45,517 --> 00:29:48,430
They foisted him on one
unsuspecting parish after another.

522
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:51,226
Adam, this isn't
an indictment of the church.

523
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:53,963
It wasn't a priest who did
this, it was a pedophile.

524
00:29:54,993 --> 00:29:57,974
If we want to get him,
this is the only way.

525
00:29:58,029 --> 00:30:00,839
All right. I'll talk to the Archbishop.
I'll let him know what's coming.

526
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:04,045
And we still have to prove
Krolinsky bribed Morino.

527
00:30:04,269 --> 00:30:05,873
Start with
the financial records.

528
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:10,047
Unindicted co-conspirators.

529
00:30:10,575 --> 00:30:13,488
My aunt who says the rosary every
morning's gonna have a conniption.

530
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:16,682
The church should've dropped a
dime on this guy 30 years ago.

531
00:30:16,881 --> 00:30:18,019
Oh, yeah. Right.

532
00:30:18,082 --> 00:30:20,824
Because they're the only people in the
world who scratch each other's backs.

533
00:30:20,885 --> 00:30:23,798
Unlike politicians and cops,
just to name two.

534
00:30:24,189 --> 00:30:27,261
If it's any comfort to your aunt,
we have the Archbishop's blessing.

535
00:30:27,725 --> 00:30:32,333
Hey, unless Krolinsky's supporting his
local bookie, I think I have something.

536
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:37,136
$50,000 cash withdrawal.
The week before Morino died.

537
00:30:37,635 --> 00:30:39,308
If it turns up on
Morino's account...

538
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:41,850
The corruption task force already
went through Morino's books.

539
00:30:41,906 --> 00:30:43,214
We're not gonna find
anything they didn't.

540
00:30:43,441 --> 00:30:46,047
Has anyone bothered to look
into his wife's finances?

541
00:30:47,412 --> 00:30:49,392
It's bad enough
what Billy did to himself.

542
00:30:49,447 --> 00:30:51,723
Now you want to say
that he was taking a bribe?

543
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:55,088
You bought T-bills a couple
of weeks ago, Mrs. Morino.

544
00:30:55,153 --> 00:30:57,895
$50,000 worth
in your children's names.

545
00:31:00,592 --> 00:31:04,096
Judy, we have to know
where that money came from.

546
00:31:04,662 --> 00:31:08,405
If it came from Krolinsky, we got him.
That's what Billy wanted.

547
00:31:10,301 --> 00:31:14,272
I found the money in an envelope
a week after Billy died.

548
00:31:15,006 --> 00:31:17,043
Was there anything else
in the envelope?

549
00:31:17,108 --> 00:31:19,782
Yes. A note.

550
00:31:20,778 --> 00:31:23,759
Billy said I was supposed to use the
money to take care of the kids.

551
00:31:28,653 --> 00:31:31,862
I didn't give him a dime. I told
you, I never talked to him.

552
00:31:32,023 --> 00:31:34,025
Then what did you do
with the money?

553
00:31:35,426 --> 00:31:37,269
Take some Boy Scouts
on a field trip?

554
00:31:37,328 --> 00:31:40,775
Mr. McCoy, unless you have actual
questions for him, we're done here.

555
00:31:40,832 --> 00:31:44,678
He can start by answering
for 30 years of sexual abuse.

556
00:31:47,338 --> 00:31:50,785
We have all the names
and dates and locations.

557
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:51,979
Where did you get this?

558
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:55,691
The archdiocese. They want him
behind bars as much as we do.

559
00:31:56,281 --> 00:31:57,624
LOGAN: Where do you
want to start, Father?

560
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:00,688
At the top of the pile
or the bottom?

561
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:02,723
That won't be necessary.
ZINNS: Joe...

562
00:32:02,787 --> 00:32:04,425
No, I want to do this.

563
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:09,938
I was a very sick man. That's
why I left the priesthood.

564
00:32:11,062 --> 00:32:15,636
You're blaming the church? They
didn't molest kids. You did.

565
00:32:15,733 --> 00:32:17,303
I'm a different man now, Mike.

566
00:32:17,735 --> 00:32:20,716
You should be happy how I've turned out.
I have a wonderful family...

567
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:23,912
No. No. I can't
listen to this crap.

568
00:32:23,975 --> 00:32:26,649
I don't think a jury will be
very much interested, either.

569
00:32:26,844 --> 00:32:28,721
You'll never prove where
Morino's money came from.

570
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:31,420
I'll let 12 mothers and
fathers make the connection.

571
00:32:37,322 --> 00:32:38,733
Give us a minute, Mr. McCoy.

572
00:32:49,033 --> 00:32:51,104
That son of a bitch is lucky
I didn't smack him.

573
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:53,942
So are we.

574
00:32:54,005 --> 00:32:56,007
There's people like him
in every neighborhood.

575
00:32:56,174 --> 00:32:59,348
Could be the little league coach,
your kid's favorite teacher.

576
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:01,984
It's too bad they don't
glow in the dark.

577
00:33:13,691 --> 00:33:16,695
It's a matter of law that a
payment between accomplices

578
00:33:16,761 --> 00:33:18,536
isn't an element
of a conspiracy.

579
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:22,307
Meaning such payment does not
extend the life of the conspiracy.

580
00:33:22,367 --> 00:33:24,540
Meaning you have no case.

581
00:33:24,602 --> 00:33:26,843
What accomplice
are you talking about?

582
00:33:29,574 --> 00:33:31,349
Back when I had my illness,

583
00:33:34,212 --> 00:33:36,852
Billy Morino used to
invite boys to visit with me.

584
00:33:38,249 --> 00:33:40,229
ZINNS: To put it bluntly,
Morino was his pimp.

585
00:33:40,818 --> 00:33:43,890
My client gave him the $50,000
as a belated gratuity.

586
00:33:51,262 --> 00:33:54,675
He's unbelievable.
He molested these kids.

587
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:57,444
And now he's trying to blame
one of his own victims.

588
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:00,182
Unfortunately, it may work.

589
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:04,513
If they prove Morino was getting
boys for Krolinsky 25 years ago,

590
00:34:04,575 --> 00:34:07,385
the jury can infer that the payment
was for services rendered.

591
00:34:07,445 --> 00:34:10,449
Therefore your case ended
back in the '70s somewhere.

592
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:13,355
Krolinsky can put whatever
spin on the facts he wants.

593
00:34:13,418 --> 00:34:16,456
A jury won't take the word
of an admitted child molester.

594
00:34:16,521 --> 00:34:18,967
Unless his victims
confirm Morino's involvement.

595
00:34:19,023 --> 00:34:23,165
I spoke to them. They say that
Morino was not part of the equation.

596
00:34:23,361 --> 00:34:27,002
And of course, they wouldn't
lie just to convict Krolinsky.

597
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:31,509
But you remind them that we still
put people in jail for perjury.

598
00:34:34,105 --> 00:34:39,077
McCoy says Morino took a bribe. The
other side says he was a pimp.

599
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:44,386
Well, that's a hell of a choice. So
what is it, column A or column B?

600
00:34:46,951 --> 00:34:48,794
It's just two friends
talking, Mikey.

601
00:34:52,657 --> 00:34:57,128
When I was 12, Billy tried to recruit
me for a matinee with Father Joe.

602
00:34:58,362 --> 00:35:00,205
What, do you think
less of him because of it?

603
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:06,244
Come on, Mike. You know how
guys like Krolinsky operate.

604
00:35:06,571 --> 00:35:09,017
They manipulate these kids.
They know what buttons to push.

605
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,344
Kid's got no father,

606
00:35:10,408 --> 00:35:12,684
the mother works two jobs,
the kid's small for his age.

607
00:35:12,743 --> 00:35:15,986
Yeah, I know. I know.

608
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:20,486
So, you gonna let
McCoy in on this secret?

609
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:23,863
He's not calling me in
as a witness. I begged off.

610
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:29,700
What, was I supposed to get up in court and
put another bullet through Billy's head?

611
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:34,209
Oh, good. So you're off the hook. So
long as nobody asks you the question.

612
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,502
Maybe I won't remember.

613
00:35:41,906 --> 00:35:44,910
Krolinsky goes to prison, I
wouldn't exactly cry about it, Don.

614
00:35:45,343 --> 00:35:48,256
So you might as well toss that
badge of yours in the garbage.

615
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:51,585
Thanks for the help.

616
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:54,389
I'm not gonna run to teacher, Mike.
You do what you gotta do.

617
00:35:54,452 --> 00:35:56,454
I'm just telling you, you
don't owe Morino a thing.

618
00:35:56,521 --> 00:35:57,693
Oh, the hell I don't.

619
00:35:58,289 --> 00:36:00,394
When he tried to recruit me
that day, you know what I did?

620
00:36:00,458 --> 00:36:02,938
I decked him. Instead of
running to the nearest cop.

621
00:36:05,062 --> 00:36:10,034
The other week when he called me, I had
a feeling what it was about, you know?

622
00:36:11,802 --> 00:36:12,837
(SIGHS)

623
00:36:12,904 --> 00:36:16,351
I did the same thing I've been doing for 25 years.
I avoided the subject.

624
00:36:17,375 --> 00:36:18,581
I couldn't handle it.

625
00:36:21,112 --> 00:36:25,822
My take? Neither could he. Seeing
Krolinsky brought it all back.

626
00:36:26,984 --> 00:36:29,260
Imagine the guilt about all
the kids he fed that pervert.

627
00:36:30,288 --> 00:36:32,666
The only problem is,
he shot the wrong guy.

628
00:36:34,091 --> 00:36:38,039
Come on, Mike, he never even
realized he was the victim.

629
00:36:44,835 --> 00:36:47,941
Billy mentioned this money Krolinsky
offered him to leave him alone.

630
00:36:48,973 --> 00:36:51,613
Billy didn't know what to do
about it. Neither did I.

631
00:36:53,177 --> 00:36:54,986
And that was the last time
I talked to him.

632
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:56,218
No more questions.

633
00:36:58,749 --> 00:37:02,060
You were friends with Detective Morino
when you were kids, isn't that right?

634
00:37:02,253 --> 00:37:03,323
SCULLY: Yes.

635
00:37:03,588 --> 00:37:05,067
ZINNS: You went to
ball games together?

636
00:37:05,122 --> 00:37:06,294
Sure, sometimes.

637
00:37:07,425 --> 00:37:09,962
Did you ever sit behind
the dugout at Shea?

638
00:37:12,163 --> 00:37:13,301
A couple of times.

639
00:37:13,864 --> 00:37:16,845
At 7 bucks a seat, that's a lot
of money for a working-class kid.

640
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:17,879
Where'd you get those tickets?

641
00:37:17,935 --> 00:37:19,005
I can't remember.

642
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:23,309
Didn't Billy Morino arrange for you
to get them from Mr. Krolinsky?

643
00:37:24,008 --> 00:37:25,385
I don't know.
In fact,

644
00:37:25,443 --> 00:37:29,289
didn't Billy Morino tell you, you could get
those tickets if you visited Mr. Krolinsky?

645
00:37:29,347 --> 00:37:33,591
No. Billy Morino had nothing to do with it.
That bastard abused me...

646
00:37:33,651 --> 00:37:34,755
Move to strike, Your Honor.

647
00:37:34,852 --> 00:37:37,856
Yes. The jury will disregard
the witness's last comment.

648
00:37:38,723 --> 00:37:39,861
No more questions.

649
00:37:44,462 --> 00:37:47,068
So I'll call impound and see
if the convertible turned up.

650
00:37:49,033 --> 00:37:50,410
Detective Michael Logan?

651
00:37:51,569 --> 00:37:52,877
Yes.

652
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:54,746
Have a nice day.

653
00:37:59,543 --> 00:38:02,387
A subpoena. What'd you do,
run over somebody's toes?

654
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:06,151
It's from Krolinsky's lawyer.
I'm gonna have to call McCoy.

655
00:38:07,652 --> 00:38:08,790
Damn!

656
00:38:14,258 --> 00:38:18,104
Billy was a year older than me.
I guess we were good friends.

657
00:38:19,497 --> 00:38:22,376
He lived on the same block, and
we went to the same school.

658
00:38:23,501 --> 00:38:24,605
Same church.

659
00:38:25,169 --> 00:38:28,616
And did he make a proposition
to you involving Mr. Krolinsky?

660
00:38:30,207 --> 00:38:31,686
I don't understand
the question.

661
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:35,190
ZINNS: Do you want me to speak
more slowly, Detective?

662
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:37,057
Do you want me to answer that?

663
00:38:38,416 --> 00:38:40,487
Your Honor, permission
to treat as hostile?

664
00:38:40,551 --> 00:38:41,859
Go ahead.

665
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:45,191
Detective Logan,
did Billy Morino suggest

666
00:38:45,256 --> 00:38:47,429
you have sex
with Mr. Krolinsky

667
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:49,164
in return for baseball tickets?

668
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:54,942
You're under oath, Detective.

669
00:39:01,038 --> 00:39:02,142
Yes, he did.

670
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,786
Billy was just a kid.
No more questions.

671
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:06,617
Mr. Krolinsky
manipulated him...

672
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:07,815
NOVAK: Mr. McCoy.

673
00:39:12,883 --> 00:39:17,127
No questions at this time. The
People reserve the right to recall.

674
00:39:19,557 --> 00:39:20,831
NOVAK:
You're excused, Detective.

675
00:39:20,891 --> 00:39:24,065
I remind you you're still under oath, not
to discuss your testimony with anybody.

676
00:39:26,931 --> 00:39:28,968
My client has been vindicated.

677
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:31,104
JACK: All that was missing was
the platter from Tiffany's.

678
00:39:31,168 --> 00:39:33,739
Get off my back.
This is between me and Morino.

679
00:39:33,804 --> 00:39:35,477
And the District Attorney's
Office.

680
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:38,042
You had an obligation
to tell us before the trial.

681
00:39:38,109 --> 00:39:41,818
Wait a minute. Are you telling me
that what one scared young kid did

682
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:44,917
can compare to what that
freak did to 100 kids?

683
00:39:44,982 --> 00:39:48,054
My friend's name just got dragged
through the mud up there, and for what?

684
00:39:48,586 --> 00:39:50,623
That's a hell of a system
you got, Counselor.

685
00:39:53,023 --> 00:39:55,025
Well, I think that was
both barrels.

686
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:58,165
His friend's character's
not the issue. Krolinsky's is.

687
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:02,208
Starting tomorrow, we get
to hear from his coworkers

688
00:40:02,266 --> 00:40:04,246
what a fine human being
he's become.

689
00:40:04,835 --> 00:40:08,476
Except we won't be hearing from his wife.
She hasn't been added to the witness list.

690
00:40:08,973 --> 00:40:11,351
I haven't seen her in the court
for the last few days, either.

691
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:14,916
Find out why.

692
00:40:15,379 --> 00:40:19,919
Logan was in an impossible position. I
won't push for disciplinary action.

693
00:40:19,984 --> 00:40:22,055
In the meantime, he jammed
a stick in your spokes.

694
00:40:23,521 --> 00:40:26,195
Technically, Morino was
Krolinsky's accomplice.

695
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:27,600
The money was not a bribe.

696
00:40:27,658 --> 00:40:30,662
There is no act to extend
the life of the conspiracy.

697
00:40:30,728 --> 00:40:32,036
The jury will acquit.

698
00:40:32,196 --> 00:40:35,939
Not if we can convince them that Morino
couldn't consent to be an accomplice.

699
00:40:36,167 --> 00:40:37,407
How do you intend to do that?

700
00:40:37,468 --> 00:40:40,210
Every study on pedophilia
bears it out.

701
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:44,352
The adult is always in control.
The child can never consent.

702
00:40:44,542 --> 00:40:48,319
Morino was 13. Sounds old enough
to me to know right from wrong.

703
00:40:48,379 --> 00:40:52,521
We're talking about a neglected child.
Easy pickings for a pedophile.

704
00:40:52,583 --> 00:40:55,063
They know how to play
on those weaknesses.

705
00:40:55,152 --> 00:40:57,689
They become the authority
figure in the child's life.

706
00:40:57,988 --> 00:41:01,731
Right and wrong doesn't mean anything. All
the kid wants is to please the adult.

707
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:04,068
He doesn't know he's being
used as a Judas goat.

708
00:41:04,695 --> 00:41:07,972
So you present our
expert here in rebuttal,

709
00:41:08,432 --> 00:41:11,902
and you're sure that the jury
draws the right conclusion?

710
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:17,212
Time to pull your pecans out of the fire
and give Krolinsky's lawyer a call.

711
00:41:17,508 --> 00:41:18,612
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

712
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:20,046
Yes.

713
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:21,418
We may be on to something.

714
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:25,154
Mrs. Krolinsky moved back to New Jersey
with her kids three days into the trial.

715
00:41:25,516 --> 00:41:26,517
(SCOFFS)

716
00:41:26,884 --> 00:41:28,056
There you go.

717
00:41:32,523 --> 00:41:35,299
I wanted to get my boys away
from all the publicity.

718
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:38,806
I had to take them out of school. I mean,
the things people say, you can't imagine.

719
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:42,007
You've already heard them
said in court, under oath.

720
00:41:42,099 --> 00:41:43,169
It's all lies.

721
00:41:43,434 --> 00:41:46,381
Mrs. Krolinsky, if we could
just come in. Go away.

722
00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:47,640
Mrs. Krolinsky...

723
00:41:47,705 --> 00:41:49,810
Please, I'm just
trying to protect my boys.

724
00:41:55,713 --> 00:41:57,818
What does she think
she's protecting them from?

725
00:41:57,882 --> 00:41:59,828
Now, her neighbors
read the same papers we do.

726
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:03,457
It must've been pretty upsetting hearing
those things said about her husband.

727
00:42:04,255 --> 00:42:07,793
She's been married to him 12 years.
That's the man she knows.

728
00:42:09,059 --> 00:42:11,266
Maybe that's why she moved out.

729
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:14,703
But we checked the New Jersey
records, no complaints, no charges.

730
00:42:14,899 --> 00:42:17,345
If you had a family matter
you wanted handled discreetly,

731
00:42:17,468 --> 00:42:19,709
would you run
to the local precinct?

732
00:42:19,770 --> 00:42:22,944
No. But I might
go to Family Services.

733
00:42:25,676 --> 00:42:29,590
Mrs. Krolinsky came to my office
three years ago. She was in tears.

734
00:42:30,648 --> 00:42:32,423
What did she tell you?
The night before,

735
00:42:32,483 --> 00:42:35,293
she walked in on her husband
and their nine-year-old son.

736
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:38,693
Doing something God didn't
intend. Her words, not mine.

737
00:42:39,490 --> 00:42:42,403
I started a file, scheduled
an interview with the boy.

738
00:42:42,927 --> 00:42:44,338
Did he confirm the story?

739
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:45,999
Never got a chance to find out.

740
00:42:46,363 --> 00:42:50,243
The next day, Mrs. Krolinsky was back,
apologizing to everyone in sight.

741
00:42:50,701 --> 00:42:51,736
You believed her?

742
00:42:51,802 --> 00:42:53,008
Without her cooperation,

743
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:55,175
an investigation would've
been a waste of time.

744
00:42:55,472 --> 00:42:57,918
I kept her file,
in case she changed her mind.

745
00:42:58,175 --> 00:43:00,416
I'm gonna need a copy of that.
Sure.

746
00:43:00,611 --> 00:43:02,784
I was wondering when you
people'd get back to me on this.

747
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:04,484
Excuse me?

748
00:43:04,548 --> 00:43:08,792
A couple of months ago, I got a phone call
from one of your sex crimes investigators.

749
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:10,621
A Detective Morino.

750
00:43:11,055 --> 00:43:13,763
He said he was doing a work-up
on Mr. Krolinsky.

751
00:43:13,824 --> 00:43:16,202
I sent him a copy of the file.
Never heard back.

752
00:43:17,861 --> 00:43:21,331
This is wrong. Kate was mistaken.
She told them that.

753
00:43:21,398 --> 00:43:23,708
Right or wrong, I don't care.
And neither will the jury.

754
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:25,405
They'll never see it.
It's irrelevant.

755
00:43:25,469 --> 00:43:27,039
Not as a motive for bribery.

756
00:43:27,805 --> 00:43:32,550
Detective Morino had this report. That's
what he was holding over your head.

757
00:43:33,677 --> 00:43:34,951
That's why you paid him off.

758
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:45,229
You set aside
the conspiracy and bribery.

759
00:43:46,023 --> 00:43:48,765
We're open to a plea of sex abuse
one on all the remaining counts,

760
00:43:48,826 --> 00:43:50,203
to serve concurrently.

761
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:51,898
Two-and-a-half to seven years?

762
00:43:51,962 --> 00:43:56,934
Your client is facing conviction on 19
counts of aggravated sex abuse one.

763
00:43:57,635 --> 00:44:01,742
Tack them together, they'll be planting
tomatoes on Mars by the time he gets out.

764
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:04,213
For God's sake, Mr. McCoy,
I have a family.

765
00:44:04,274 --> 00:44:05,685
I feel sorry for them.

766
00:44:05,743 --> 00:44:09,122
No, listen. I want to get help. I'm
a sick man, I want to get help...

767
00:44:09,179 --> 00:44:12,649
You're an adult.
Your victims are children.

768
00:44:15,953 --> 00:44:18,832
There's nothing you could say that
would make me feel sorry for you.

769
00:44:19,289 --> 00:44:21,166
Let's split the difference,
Mr. McCoy.

770
00:44:21,825 --> 00:44:24,305
Knock it down to a C felony
with concurrent sentences.

771
00:44:31,602 --> 00:44:33,741
He serves the maximum,
15 years.

772
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:38,151
Consider it a gift.

773
00:44:46,784 --> 00:44:49,731
Before I impose sentence,
does the defendant wish

774
00:44:49,787 --> 00:44:51,164
to make a statement?

775
00:44:52,656 --> 00:44:53,691
Yes, Your Honor.

776
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:05,002
I just wanna say
from deep in my heart,

777
00:45:08,038 --> 00:45:11,144
how sorry I am to all those
people I've offended.

778
00:45:14,812 --> 00:45:16,086
I'm very sorry.

779
00:45:21,318 --> 00:45:24,094
The defendant has met the
conditions of the plea agreement.

780
00:45:24,154 --> 00:45:28,694
In accordance, the court sentences
Joseph Krolinsky to a term of 15 years.

781
00:45:29,193 --> 00:45:32,197
The facility to be determined by
the Department of Correction.

782
00:45:33,530 --> 00:45:34,668
Court is adjourned.

783
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:35,733
(GAVEL BANGS)

784
00:45:48,912 --> 00:45:50,323
We called you Father.

785
00:45:53,150 --> 00:45:54,493
How could you do that to us?

786
00:45:57,821 --> 00:45:59,323
You even did it
to your own kid.

787
00:46:02,059 --> 00:46:03,436
How could you do that?

788
00:46:07,865 --> 00:46:09,105
They're ready to take him.
