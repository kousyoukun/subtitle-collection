NARRATOR:
In the criminal justice system

2
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:06,917
the people are represented by two
separate yet equally important groups,

3
00:00:06,974 --> 00:00:08,681
the police
who investigate crime

4
00:00:08,742 --> 00:00:11,655
and the district attorneys
who prosecute the offenders.

5
00:00:11,712 --> 00:00:13,453
These are their stories.

6
00:00:14,114 --> 00:00:16,321
If you could raise me
$20 a week, then...

7
00:00:16,383 --> 00:00:19,125
You know how my business is, Bella.
Has my phone been ringing?

8
00:00:19,186 --> 00:00:22,258
Mr. Kopinsky said
he'd raise me $20 if you did.

9
00:00:22,322 --> 00:00:26,998
If he's so flush, why do I have to match? 
I haven't had a raise since I started here.

10
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,836
He can afford to raise you if I
can, but if I can't, he can't.

11
00:00:29,897 --> 00:00:33,606
My son wants a computer.
Does that even make sense?

12
00:00:33,667 --> 00:00:36,944
Hey, Mr. Rockefeller,
you're spoiling the help.

13
00:00:39,473 --> 00:00:41,077
I'll make the coffee.

14
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:45,490
WIGGINS: Bella!
Bella, come here!

15
00:00:50,284 --> 00:00:51,422
(GASPING)

16
00:00:52,586 --> 00:00:53,963
Call 911.

17
00:00:57,591 --> 00:01:00,037
Doesn't look like a robbery. There's
no sign of a struggle here.

18
00:01:00,093 --> 00:01:03,097
Yeah, except the bullet hole in his head.
You got a time of death?

19
00:01:03,163 --> 00:01:06,667
Full rigor. Body's cool. Yesterday
afternoon, early last night.

20
00:01:07,134 --> 00:01:08,613
Drive safely.

21
00:01:08,936 --> 00:01:11,007
Gee, who'd wanna kill a lawyer?

22
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:13,642
Excuse me.
Those files are privileged.

23
00:01:13,707 --> 00:01:16,779
You need a waiver from each of
Mr. Kopinsky's clients to look at them.

24
00:01:16,843 --> 00:01:20,484
Are you Mr. Kopinsky's partner?
We just shared office space.

25
00:01:20,547 --> 00:01:23,721
But I was his lawyer.
The lawyer's lawyer, huh?

26
00:01:24,117 --> 00:01:26,063
Litigious times. Sir?

27
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:28,963
Don't tell me. His date
book's privileged, too?

28
00:01:29,022 --> 00:01:32,993
Now, his last appointment
yesterday, 6:00 p.m. Mr. Tanaka.

29
00:01:34,027 --> 00:01:36,974
Either one of you see him? I was
taking a deposition in White Plains.

30
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:39,670
I showed him in.
When I left he was still here.

31
00:01:39,733 --> 00:01:42,213
How were he and Mr. Kopinsky
getting along?

32
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:43,373
Fine.

33
00:01:44,037 --> 00:01:45,812
Are you all right, ma'am?

34
00:01:45,872 --> 00:01:48,682
Mr. Kopinsky
was going to give me a raise.

35
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:51,119
Thank you.

36
00:01:51,845 --> 00:01:53,256
This cost her money.

37
00:01:53,313 --> 00:01:57,318
When we find the shooter, she can
have the other lawyer sue him.

38
00:02:46,133 --> 00:02:47,237
The foot traffic is here.

39
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,870
The city wants
to move me around the block.

40
00:02:48,935 --> 00:02:50,471
There's nobody over there.

41
00:02:50,537 --> 00:02:51,982
That's why
you hired Mr. Kopinsky?

42
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:55,418
His ad said if he doesn't win
your case, you don't pay.

43
00:02:55,475 --> 00:02:56,920
Was he winning yours?

44
00:02:56,977 --> 00:02:59,685
He hadn't started yet. Yesterday
was our first meeting.

45
00:02:59,746 --> 00:03:03,922
Mr. Tanaka, as far as we know, you
were the last person to see him alive.

46
00:03:03,984 --> 00:03:07,090
No, I wasn't. When I left his
office a man was coming in.

47
00:03:07,154 --> 00:03:11,466
Did you get a good look at him?
Tall. Wearing glasses.

48
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:14,836
Give me a skinny cap.
No lead.

49
00:03:14,895 --> 00:03:17,671
Decaffeinated cappuccino.
With skimmed milk.

50
00:03:17,764 --> 00:03:20,074
What's the point?
$3.75.

51
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:23,740
Look, the tall guy with the glasses,
do you remember anything else?

52
00:03:23,804 --> 00:03:26,683
I stopped at the men's room
in the hall.

53
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:30,313
When I came out he was still in
Mr. Kopinsky's office, shouting.

54
00:03:30,644 --> 00:03:31,645
About what?

55
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:34,659
About what a son of a bitch
Mr. Kopinsky was.

56
00:03:43,657 --> 00:03:47,002
Nicer than his office. Dead people.
They're full of surprises.

57
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:51,372
Who are you? How did you get in?
LOGAN: Police. Who are you?

58
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:54,742
I just got off the phone
with Arthur's secretary.

59
00:03:54,801 --> 00:03:56,644
I was going to call you.

60
00:03:56,903 --> 00:04:01,409
And you are? Arthur's roommate.
Frank Rosebrock.

61
00:04:01,475 --> 00:04:04,354
Detective Logan.
Detective Briscoe.

62
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:06,288
Please, come in.

63
00:04:06,947 --> 00:04:12,454
So you and Arthur are...
Live here. 19 years.

64
00:04:14,054 --> 00:04:15,965
I can't believe he's gone.

65
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:20,133
He was shot? BRISCOE: We're
sorry for your loss.

66
00:04:20,727 --> 00:04:23,606
You can't know. Arthur is a...

67
00:04:24,631 --> 00:04:27,077
Arthur was a wonderful man.

68
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:30,776
Do you know what happened?

69
00:04:32,539 --> 00:04:37,249
Mr. Rosebrock,
were you here yesterday?

70
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:42,089
No, I was in Phoenix.
On business. I just got back.

71
00:04:42,149 --> 00:04:44,652
Look, we have to ask.

72
00:04:44,718 --> 00:04:48,359
Can you think of anybody who
might have been angry at Arthur?

73
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:53,097
Oh, one man
called here several times.

74
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,766
Arthur was working on his case
day and night.

75
00:04:55,829 --> 00:05:01,006
He sounded crazy. He threatened Arthur.
He threatened even me.

76
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:05,675
Do you remember his name? How
could I forget? Carl Piselli.

77
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:09,783
Cleans and Dirties.
I invented the product.

78
00:05:09,843 --> 00:05:12,653
Magnets. You put one
on top of the other.

79
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:16,290
Clean pig, clean dishes.
Dirty pig, dirty dishes.

80
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:17,987
(nos BARKING)

81
00:05:18,552 --> 00:05:21,089
You put this
on a dishwasher, huh?

82
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:25,933
A husband's compulsive. He rinses
the dishes before he puts them in.

83
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:28,097
Wife comes along, takes a look,

84
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:31,301
thinks they're clean, puts
dirty dishes on the shelf.

85
00:05:31,364 --> 00:05:34,368
With these, no problem.
And they're cute.

86
00:05:34,434 --> 00:05:37,176
And these are why you
hired Mr. Kopinsky? Yes.

87
00:05:37,237 --> 00:05:40,184
I submitted these six
months ago to Empire Gifts.

88
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,186
Big sales rep firm.

89
00:05:42,242 --> 00:05:44,449
They could sell
a product like this.

90
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:47,321
I tried selling them myself.
It doesn't work.

91
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:52,659
Mr. Piselli, could be there's just
not a market for products like this.

92
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:55,495
Oh? Empire said, "No, thanks."

93
00:05:55,555 --> 00:05:58,092
Three months later they come
out with Neats and Nasties.

94
00:05:58,158 --> 00:06:03,005
Their pig wears a dress instead of a suit.
They sold 60,000. Thieves.

95
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,934
Yeah, we understand
that you weren't too happy

96
00:06:05,999 --> 00:06:08,639
with the way Mr. Kopinsky
was handling your case.

97
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:11,410
He took my retainer
and didn't do a damn thing.

98
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:12,848
You wanna tell us,
just for the record,

99
00:06:12,906 --> 00:06:15,113
where you were last night
about 7:00?

100
00:06:15,175 --> 00:06:19,555
Listening to the Hudson Jazz Orchestra.
Summer stage. Central Park.

101
00:06:19,613 --> 00:06:23,493
You got a ticket stub?
Free concert.

102
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,492
The only show in town
that doesn't rip you off.

103
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:34,871
Yes, Carl Piselli. He claimed
he invented Neats and Nasties.

104
00:06:34,928 --> 00:06:37,340
Then last year he claimed that
he invented Killer Bee Honey.

105
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,877
The year before that it was
Singing Sam's Shower Songs.

106
00:06:39,933 --> 00:06:41,310
I'm afraid I missed that one.

107
00:06:41,368 --> 00:06:44,315
Oh, waterproof lyric cards
for singing in the shower.

108
00:06:44,371 --> 00:06:46,681
It does very well
on Father's Day.

109
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,549
You know, all this stuff.

110
00:06:48,608 --> 00:06:52,146
Ceramic kittens.
Flatulence, The Game.

111
00:06:52,445 --> 00:06:56,222
This is a business?
Yes. It's a good one.

112
00:06:56,283 --> 00:07:00,129
And so Piselli's claims are groundless?
You came up with all this stuff?

113
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:05,465
Detective, if Marconi and Tesla can
independently invent the radio,

114
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:07,232
is it so hard to believe
that two people

115
00:07:07,294 --> 00:07:09,797
thought of putting magnets
on dishwashers?

116
00:07:09,863 --> 00:07:12,275
But you did meet Mr. Piselli?

117
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:14,945
That buzzer on the door.
The security camera.

118
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:17,504
They are there because I meet
people like Carl Piselli.

119
00:07:17,571 --> 00:07:19,642
He came in here.
He made threats.

120
00:07:19,706 --> 00:07:21,913
Did you ever hear him
threaten Mr. Kopinsky?

121
00:07:21,975 --> 00:07:26,014
Several times. I'm sure Kopinsky
was sorry he ever took the case.

122
00:07:28,048 --> 00:07:29,550
Forget becoming president.

123
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:32,927
The real American dream is
inventing the next pet rock.

124
00:07:32,986 --> 00:07:37,093
Yeah, well, Piselli fits the bill.
He wears glasses and he's mad.

125
00:07:37,157 --> 00:07:40,695
One of my husband's customers comes
in the hardware store twice a week

126
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:45,004
to buy parts for an automatic
toilet-seat drop he's inventing.

127
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:47,270
Did he hire Kopinsky?

128
00:07:47,334 --> 00:07:50,838
He says it'll reduce the
conflict between the sexes.

129
00:07:51,237 --> 00:07:53,444
Yo, did you get anything
from the cappuccino king?

130
00:07:53,506 --> 00:07:55,952
I showed him the picture.
He wasn't sure.

131
00:07:56,443 --> 00:07:58,354
I say we bring in
Piselli anyway.

132
00:07:58,411 --> 00:08:00,186
Show him
some of our new products.

133
00:08:00,246 --> 00:08:01,589
Check his alibi first.

134
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:04,925
What, a free concert in Central Park?
You're talking about thousands of people.

135
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:07,295
One who might have been
Mr. Piselli.

136
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:11,928
There were thousands
of people here.

137
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:14,563
Humor us.
We're humoring a lieutenant.

138
00:08:14,627 --> 00:08:16,766
Plus it was night
so it was dark.

139
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:19,174
Would you just
look at the picture?

140
00:08:21,468 --> 00:08:23,709
Oh, I remember him.
You do?

141
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:25,340
He had a blowup
with the ushers.

142
00:08:25,405 --> 00:08:27,646
They wouldn't let him come in
with his yapping dog.

143
00:08:27,707 --> 00:08:31,177
So did he leave early?
No. He put a muzzle on it.

144
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:33,850
I wish we'd had one for him.
Thanks.

145
00:08:34,481 --> 00:08:37,860
Maybe Piselli's telling the
truth about the magnets, too.

146
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:39,294
(PAGER BEEPING)

147
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,060
Kincaid.

148
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:45,228
Since when are prosecutors allowed
to look at lawyers' files?

149
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:46,668
There are some
criminal cases in there.

150
00:08:46,726 --> 00:08:48,797
I thought Kopinsky
only handled civil cases.

151
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:50,864
Arthur was a rarity.
A legal generalist.

152
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:54,503
Anything for a buck, huh? We have
a search warrant, Mr. Wiggins.

153
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:58,276
It specifies we can't use
privileged material about any crime

154
00:08:58,338 --> 00:09:00,614
except the murder
of Mr. Kopinsky.

155
00:09:00,673 --> 00:09:02,152
May I see it?

156
00:09:04,411 --> 00:09:07,187
Did you stay on top of what
Kopinsky was working on?

157
00:09:07,247 --> 00:09:09,022
He held things pretty close.

158
00:09:09,082 --> 00:09:12,620
I was just his attorney for the
record, a matter of convenience.

159
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:16,401
This seems to be in order.
Happy hunting.

160
00:09:17,123 --> 00:09:20,161
You think someone killed him
over a shoplifting beef?

161
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:23,704
He settled a medical
malpractice claim for $15,000.

162
00:09:23,763 --> 00:09:27,404
His fee was one-third.
The doctor's insurance paid.

163
00:09:27,467 --> 00:09:30,277
I never realized the law was
such an exciting profession.

164
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:32,179
I get to work with you guys.

165
00:09:33,006 --> 00:09:35,748
"Piselli v. Empire Gifts."

166
00:09:35,809 --> 00:09:37,584
BRISCOE: Yeah,
we've been down that road.

167
00:09:37,644 --> 00:09:39,317
"Willard Tappan"?

168
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:42,087
That's the savings and loan
king who went down in flames.

169
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:45,220
Yeah, what'd he get? A couple of
years in the federal Club Med?

170
00:09:45,285 --> 00:09:47,765
The guy should've got life for
all the people he swindled.

171
00:09:47,821 --> 00:09:50,233
Kopinsky was trying
to help them.

172
00:09:50,523 --> 00:09:52,901
Here's a letter
to one of Tappan's victims.

173
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:56,532
"I may be able to collect
your judgment," he says.

174
00:09:57,197 --> 00:10:00,508
Kopinsky wrote this guy that he had a
lead on some money hidden by Tappan.

175
00:10:00,567 --> 00:10:05,380
It says he just needs three grand for
research expenses to track it down.

176
00:10:07,407 --> 00:10:10,513
There must be about
50 of these letters in here.

177
00:10:11,044 --> 00:10:15,151
If Tappan hid some money away
and Kopinsky was on to it,

178
00:10:15,215 --> 00:10:18,094
that gives Tappan
a nice motive for murder.

179
00:10:19,586 --> 00:10:23,261
Willard Tappan's Savings and Loan
opened a branch in my neighborhood.

180
00:10:23,323 --> 00:10:25,064
Borough president
cut the ribbon.

181
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:29,164
I had some friends who lost years'
worth of savings. It destroyed people.

182
00:10:29,229 --> 00:10:30,708
Well, the question is,

183
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:34,711
do you think Tappan's the type of guy
to graduate from fraud to homicide?

184
00:10:34,767 --> 00:10:36,974
If his money's at stake, yes.

185
00:10:37,337 --> 00:10:38,975
Isn't he in federal prison?

186
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:42,144
He was moved to a halfway house
in Manhattan last month.

187
00:10:42,342 --> 00:10:45,687
Make my day. Nail that son
of a bitch for murder.

188
00:10:48,081 --> 00:10:53,690
Kopinsky? You know, I had a racehorse
named Prince Korinsky once.

189
00:10:54,521 --> 00:10:56,694
The government took him,
along with everything else.

190
00:10:56,756 --> 00:11:00,203
I suppose Chelsea's riding him now.
He was a lawyer.

191
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,803
He told people he had a lead
on some money you hid away.

192
00:11:03,863 --> 00:11:07,709
My famous hidden money.
It doesn't exist.

193
00:11:08,868 --> 00:11:12,179
You cost the taxpayers, what,
half a billion dollars?

194
00:11:12,238 --> 00:11:13,774
Maybe you put some away
for a rainy day.

195
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:17,083
You know, that's what the United
States Government thought.

196
00:11:17,143 --> 00:11:19,749
That's what my creditors'
attorneys thought.

197
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:23,727
They scoured the world searching
for my buried treasure.

198
00:11:24,384 --> 00:11:26,159
They found nothing.

199
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:29,098
It was on the front page
of The Wall Street Journal.

200
00:11:29,155 --> 00:11:31,726
Maybe Kopinsky
didn't read that issue.

201
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:33,632
Excuse me.

202
00:11:33,927 --> 00:11:35,736
You know, last year,
in Chicago,

203
00:11:35,795 --> 00:11:39,436
a lawyer went to jail for telling
people he'd found my hidden money.

204
00:11:39,499 --> 00:11:43,641
All he needed to get it was
a modest retainer up front.

205
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:49,378
You'll excuse me. I'm off to
rake leaves in Central Park.

206
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:52,581
Part of my rehabilitation.

207
00:11:55,915 --> 00:11:58,657
When Willard Tappan's Savings
and Loan went in the crapper,

208
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:00,857
I represented
its major creditors.

209
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,922
We seized
the corporate lodge in Aspen

210
00:12:02,989 --> 00:12:05,731
where Tappan took his friends
and prostitutes,

211
00:12:05,792 --> 00:12:08,864
the corporate jet
he used for his golf outings,

212
00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:12,075
the corporate apartments
in Miami and London.

213
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:14,744
Sounds like quite a haul.

214
00:12:14,801 --> 00:12:16,940
Everything turned out
to be mortgaged elsewhere,

215
00:12:17,003 --> 00:12:19,210
sometimes two or three times.

216
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:22,942
Did any of your clients ever
hear from Arthur Kopinsky?

217
00:12:23,476 --> 00:12:24,614
Financial institutions.

218
00:12:24,677 --> 00:12:27,590
They lose a few million,
it's not the end of the world.

219
00:12:27,647 --> 00:12:29,786
It's people who lost
a few thousand,

220
00:12:29,849 --> 00:12:32,989
who only had a few thousand, who'd
be vulnerable to that kind of thing.

221
00:12:33,052 --> 00:12:34,827
Why'd they lose out?

222
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,894
I mean, weren't their
accounts insured?

223
00:12:37,957 --> 00:12:41,336
Their accounts, yes, but a lot
of them went in to buy CDs,

224
00:12:41,394 --> 00:12:45,103
and Tappan's people sold them bonds
in the Savings and Loan instead.

225
00:12:45,832 --> 00:12:48,244
They became
unsecured creditors.

226
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:51,173
They got nothing.

227
00:12:52,572 --> 00:12:57,043
My husband worked 32 years
for Con Edison on pipes.

228
00:12:57,577 --> 00:12:59,750
Saved $60 a week.

229
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:04,757
He was going to buy us a place in
South Carolina when he retired.

230
00:13:04,817 --> 00:13:08,287
But Tappan cleaned him out?
Tappan killed him.

231
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:13,565
Coronary. He was never sick before.
Just gave out.

232
00:13:14,027 --> 00:13:16,507
The day after he went down,
so did I.

233
00:13:16,562 --> 00:13:19,270
And Mr. Kopinsky told you
he'd get you your money back?

234
00:13:19,332 --> 00:13:25,749
Right. If I gave him $3,000 to check
on some bank records in the Caribbean.

235
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:29,249
Where am I to get $3,000?

236
00:13:29,676 --> 00:13:31,656
So you never
got involved with him?

237
00:13:31,711 --> 00:13:36,091
I rounded up $600 from my
sister and her daughter.

238
00:13:36,616 --> 00:13:41,656
He took it as a down payment.
Then he asked for $600 more.

239
00:13:42,255 --> 00:13:46,294
He said he was this close
to tracking down my money.

240
00:13:46,359 --> 00:13:49,932
But he never quite did.
I know.

241
00:13:50,697 --> 00:13:54,474
If I'm not the biggest fool on
earth, I don't know who is.

242
00:13:57,270 --> 00:14:00,114
Some guy loses
his lifesavings to Tappan,

243
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:03,817
then Kopinsky comes along
and licks the plate.

244
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:05,917
I'd wanna kill him, too.

245
00:14:05,979 --> 00:14:07,549
So, what, you wanna be
reassigned to a squad

246
00:14:07,613 --> 00:14:10,890
that tracks down murderers
you don't sympathize with?

247
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:15,496
Same old cliche.
The little guy gets screwed.

248
00:14:15,555 --> 00:14:18,126
That lawyer's rich clients
get some of their money back,

249
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:21,035
and I guarantee you
he collected his fee.

250
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:24,165
Listen, I've saved up some
money for my retirement.

251
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:27,734
I keep it split up between three banks
and two different mutual funds.

252
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:31,338
If you don't trust one that
much, then nobody can hurt you.

253
00:14:31,771 --> 00:14:35,150
What's that, financial advice
or marriage counseling?

254
00:14:39,746 --> 00:14:41,817
CURREN: You're here
about Mr. Kopinsky?

255
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,690
Your mother's name
was on a list of people

256
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,991
he solicited
about Willard Tappan.

257
00:14:46,152 --> 00:14:49,065
Yeah, so was I. He was trying
to get our money back for us.

258
00:14:49,122 --> 00:14:53,298
$830,000.
Everything my husband left me.

259
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:56,797
We lived on Beekman Place.

260
00:14:56,863 --> 00:14:59,742
After my husband died,
Johnny used to visit me there

261
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:02,177
and we'd walk
to Madison Avenue.

262
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:04,377
Now.

263
00:15:04,771 --> 00:15:06,182
Here.

264
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:08,549
We don't even have privacy.

265
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:12,545
Do you think the Tappan business had
something to do with the murder?

266
00:15:12,612 --> 00:15:15,957
BRISCOE: We don't know. Poor man.
He was our last hope.

267
00:15:16,015 --> 00:15:20,486
We were just wondering, did Mr. Kopinsky
ever ask you for money for his expenses?

268
00:15:20,553 --> 00:15:22,897
Yes, he asked for $3,000.

269
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:26,198
I didn't have that much,
so I just gave him $1,000.

270
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:29,069
I sent him a check
just the other day.

271
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:31,608
Do you know who's taking over
his cases?

272
00:15:31,664 --> 00:15:36,306
We're not sure. Mr. Curren,
had you seen Kopinsky lately?

273
00:15:36,369 --> 00:15:40,112
No. He said he'd call
if he had anything to report.

274
00:15:42,909 --> 00:15:45,583
We talked to a dozen people
on Kopinsky's list.

275
00:15:45,645 --> 00:15:48,421
It was a con all right, but half
of them don't even know it yet.

276
00:15:48,481 --> 00:15:52,054
He collected tens of thousands
of dollars for research.

277
00:15:52,385 --> 00:15:56,060
He never showed anyone any hard evidence
that he'd found Tappan's money.

278
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:59,695
What a guy. Swindling people
who'd already been swindled.

279
00:15:59,826 --> 00:16:03,774
You gotta hand it to him. They all
had proven track records as victims.

280
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:05,275
(PHONE RINGING)

281
00:16:05,565 --> 00:16:06,976
Van Buren.

282
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:12,006
Does one of you have a
girlfriend in a nursing home?

283
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:14,108
No, that would be Lennie.

284
00:16:15,374 --> 00:16:21,154
Mrs. Curren and her son lied to you boys.
I can't stand liars.

285
00:16:21,214 --> 00:16:23,251
Well, we appreciate
your help, ma'am.

286
00:16:23,516 --> 00:16:26,429
So what if she lived
on the East Side?

287
00:16:26,853 --> 00:16:30,892
You'd think it was Buckingham
Palace, her attitude.

288
00:16:32,024 --> 00:16:35,335
We don't get to choose
our roommates here, you know.

289
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:38,602
Mrs. Greenfield,
what was this lie?

290
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:43,909
Well, Johnny, her son, came to visit her
the night before that lawyer was killed.

291
00:16:44,403 --> 00:16:46,508
She told him she had good news.

292
00:16:46,572 --> 00:16:49,348
A surprise.
A surprise?

293
00:16:50,042 --> 00:16:54,457
She'd heard from that lawyer. He
was going to get her money back.

294
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:58,326
She'd sent him a check.
Johnny was furious.

295
00:16:59,051 --> 00:17:03,727
He said the lawyer was a confidence man.
He'd taken Johnny's money, too.

296
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:07,703
And Johnny didn't tell his mother this?
He hadn't wanted to upset her.

297
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:12,402
But when he heard that his mother
had sent him her last $3,000,

298
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:17,075
Johnny said he would get it
back no matter what it took.

299
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,313
What do you think?

300
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:24,286
I think she enjoyed
double-dating with us

301
00:17:24,343 --> 00:17:26,380
a lot more than some
nursing-home attendant,

302
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:29,085
and she doesn't like
Mrs. Curren much.

303
00:17:29,148 --> 00:17:31,856
I don't think she's making
up a story like that.

304
00:17:31,918 --> 00:17:34,956
It's making her life a lot
more interesting, isn't it?

305
00:17:35,121 --> 00:17:37,965
What's interesting
is Kopinsky's phone log.

306
00:17:38,457 --> 00:17:41,438
The day he was shot, John
Curren called three times.

307
00:17:42,295 --> 00:17:46,175
Three messages.
"Please call. Urgent."

308
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:48,178
Kopinsky was ducking him.

309
00:17:49,101 --> 00:17:51,103
Some people don't like that.

310
00:17:53,973 --> 00:17:55,008
(CHILDREN LAUGHING)

311
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:57,520
Okay, you guys,
we need the living room here.

312
00:17:57,577 --> 00:17:59,318
Nintendo off.

313
00:18:06,352 --> 00:18:08,832
What are you saying?
Mr. Kopinsky lied to us?

314
00:18:08,888 --> 00:18:12,097
He was milking you and about 50
other people with a phony story

315
00:18:12,158 --> 00:18:14,297
about finding Tappan's money.

316
00:18:15,695 --> 00:18:18,471
Oh, my God. It's all right.
We'll be okay.

317
00:18:18,531 --> 00:18:23,207
We're thinking maybe this didn't come as
a complete surprise to you, Mr. Curren.

318
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:26,876
Of course it does. We were counting on him.
We were going to move.

319
00:18:27,173 --> 00:18:28,709
You didn't tell her?

320
00:18:30,142 --> 00:18:33,021
Well, maybe I suspected he wasn't
doing everything he said he was.

321
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:35,992
I didn't see any reason
to worry everybody.

322
00:18:36,349 --> 00:18:41,128
Maybe you were a little upset about your
mother sending him her last $3,000?

323
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:43,331
Your mother did? When?

324
00:18:43,656 --> 00:18:47,035
You said you were waiting
for Mr. Kopinsky to call,

325
00:18:47,093 --> 00:18:49,232
but you called him
three times the other day.

326
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:52,742
Yeah, well, my mother was involved. I
wanted to see how things were going.

327
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:55,005
Okay, then, you wouldn't mind
coming down to the precinct

328
00:18:55,067 --> 00:18:57,240
for some identification
procedure, would you?

329
00:18:57,303 --> 00:18:59,943
You don't think Johnny might
have killed that man?

330
00:19:00,006 --> 00:19:02,987
If he didn't,
he'll be back here in an hour.

331
00:19:09,882 --> 00:19:13,853
TANAKA: I didn't see him very long. VAN
BUREN: Take your time, Mr. Tanaka.

332
00:19:20,126 --> 00:19:22,538
I'd think number four.
You think?

333
00:19:24,397 --> 00:19:25,842
Number four.

334
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:28,779
VAN BUREN:
Thank you, Mr. Tanaka.

335
00:19:32,605 --> 00:19:34,209
Curren didn't want a lawyer.

336
00:19:34,273 --> 00:19:37,413
Yeah, I guess after
Kopinsky he had his fill.

337
00:19:37,977 --> 00:19:42,153
Think that ID will hold up?
To get a search warrant, yeah.

338
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:44,890
When's my husband coming home?

339
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:48,864
He's just answering a few questions for us.
Does your husband own a gun?

340
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:52,130
A gun?
I won't keep one in the house.

341
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:56,939
Oh, Willard Tappan
on his 100-foot yacht.

342
00:19:57,496 --> 00:20:01,672
Tappan rents the Temple of Dendur
for his daughter's debutante ball.

343
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:04,446
Tappan named to the
Businessman's Hall of Fame.

344
00:20:04,503 --> 00:20:08,144
Your husband collect these?
That man stole all our money.

345
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:12,952
It was the same year Johnny lost his job.
He was unemployed for 14 months.

346
00:20:16,849 --> 00:20:18,294
What's that?

347
00:20:18,684 --> 00:20:23,633
Your mother-in-law's check
to Mr. Kopinsky for $3,000.

348
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:29,232
You really have to see it from
our point of view, Johnny.

349
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:34,769
You said you hadn't seen
Kopinsky for a while,

350
00:20:36,302 --> 00:20:38,543
but our witness saw you go in.

351
00:20:39,472 --> 00:20:41,247
Heard you shouting.

352
00:20:43,142 --> 00:20:45,486
You know that phone call
I just had?

353
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:50,852
My partner found the check
your mother wrote to Kopinsky.

354
00:20:55,021 --> 00:20:57,228
It was in your jacket pocket.

355
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:07,038
How'd it get there?

356
00:21:12,872 --> 00:21:16,319
How did it get from Kopinsky's
office to your apartment?

357
00:21:17,877 --> 00:21:19,515
What, did it fly?

358
00:21:21,647 --> 00:21:23,251
Come on, Johnny.

359
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:26,893
You found out Kopinsky
was fleecing your mother

360
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:30,297
after he had already fleeced
you, and you got mad!

361
00:21:30,356 --> 00:21:32,461
Hell, I would've gotten mad.

362
00:21:33,392 --> 00:21:37,135
May I please call my wife? As
soon as we're finished here.

363
00:21:37,663 --> 00:21:39,836
Let's just wrap this all up.

364
00:21:42,435 --> 00:21:45,473
So you went downtown to get
your mother's money back.

365
00:21:47,006 --> 00:21:49,885
What happened?
Did Kopinsky stall you?

366
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:54,352
No.
Did he laugh at you?

367
00:21:57,049 --> 00:21:58,585
No.

368
00:22:00,352 --> 00:22:02,923
I give up. What happened?

369
00:22:03,622 --> 00:22:05,431
He gave me the check back.

370
00:22:05,491 --> 00:22:08,961
You went down to Kopinsky's, and
he gave you the check, huh?

371
00:22:11,497 --> 00:22:13,340
That's what happened.

372
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:15,535
Well, you know,

373
00:22:16,302 --> 00:22:20,444
that's just not the kind of
fellow we heard he was, Johnny.

374
00:22:21,507 --> 00:22:23,748
How ever did you persuade him?

375
00:22:25,444 --> 00:22:27,549
He just gave it back to me.

376
00:22:33,385 --> 00:22:34,523
I think...

377
00:22:35,821 --> 00:22:38,267
I think
I'd like to see a lawyer now.

378
00:22:43,129 --> 00:22:45,166
Do you believe it?
No.

379
00:22:46,165 --> 00:22:48,202
That's good enough for me.

380
00:22:50,703 --> 00:22:54,845
VAN BUREN: John Curren, you're under
arrest for the murder of Arthur Kopinsky.

381
00:22:54,907 --> 00:22:56,511
You have the right
to remain silent.

382
00:22:56,575 --> 00:22:59,749
Anything you say or do can
or will be used against you...

383
00:23:00,579 --> 00:23:04,026
"Docket number 65473.
People v. John Curren."

384
00:23:04,083 --> 00:23:05,892
"Murder in the second degree."

385
00:23:05,951 --> 00:23:09,763
Mr. Curren pleads not guilty. The
People seek high bail, Your Honor.

386
00:23:09,822 --> 00:23:10,857
The crime was violent.

387
00:23:10,923 --> 00:23:13,995
The defendant sought to elude
capture by lying to the police.

388
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:16,767
The victim is Arthur Kopinsky?

389
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:19,602
I knew Kopinsky.

390
00:23:19,665 --> 00:23:20,905
Perhaps Your Honor
should recuse himself

391
00:23:20,966 --> 00:23:22,411
from setting bail in this case?

392
00:23:22,468 --> 00:23:25,745
If anything, Miss Bell, I'd be
biased in favor of your client.

393
00:23:25,805 --> 00:23:27,978
Your Honor, this man
is charged with murder.

394
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:30,384
Don't worry, Counselor.
Bail, $100,000.

395
00:23:31,477 --> 00:23:33,081
This won't even get to trial.

396
00:23:33,145 --> 00:23:36,922
Mr. Curren was deprived of an attorney
at his lineup and interrogation.

397
00:23:36,982 --> 00:23:40,191
The police have to offer him a lawyer,
not force one down his throat.

398
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:43,825
I'm sure I know how the police couched their offer.
You know how they operate.

399
00:23:43,889 --> 00:23:47,200
Get off your soapbox, Sally.
You're blocking the view.

400
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:50,502
So what are you offering? A fair
trial by a jury of his peers.

401
00:23:50,563 --> 00:23:52,304
Oh, a jury's gonna feel
sorry for him.

402
00:23:52,364 --> 00:23:55,470
He was swindled by Tappan. He
was swindled again by Kopinsky.

403
00:23:55,534 --> 00:23:58,572
Kopinsky needed to be disbarred,
not shot in the head.

404
00:24:02,608 --> 00:24:06,556
Johnny's face turned red.
He paced around the room.

405
00:24:07,413 --> 00:24:11,486
"Kopinsky, Kopinsky."
He kept saying the name.

406
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:13,655
What did he say about
Mr. Kopinsky?

407
00:24:13,719 --> 00:24:16,723
He said he'd get his mother's money back.
He promised her.

408
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:19,429
Thank you. Nothing further.

409
00:24:23,529 --> 00:24:27,477
So, Mr. Curren was angry?
Yes. Very angry.

410
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,947
You'd seen Mr. Curren angry before,
hadn't you, Mrs. Greenfield?

411
00:24:31,003 --> 00:24:34,678
Yes, I have.
I didn't like it then, either.

412
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,850
This was when the nursing home wanted
to move his mother to another room.

413
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:40,288
He was sometimes late
paying her bill.

414
00:24:40,379 --> 00:24:42,518
Well, he got very angry
at the director, didn't he?

415
00:24:42,581 --> 00:24:43,924
I remember.

416
00:24:45,017 --> 00:24:48,760
Did he kill the director?
No. Of course not.

417
00:24:49,421 --> 00:24:50,798
Thank you.

418
00:24:51,223 --> 00:24:53,066
And how did Mr. Curren sound

419
00:24:53,125 --> 00:24:56,265
during his phone calls to
Mr. Kopinsky the day of the murder?

420
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:58,035
He was definitely upset.

421
00:24:58,097 --> 00:24:59,770
Did he raise his voice?

422
00:24:59,832 --> 00:25:02,745
He said my boss was a crook
and I was a crook, too.

423
00:25:02,801 --> 00:25:06,078
Why were you a crook?
I don't know. He was upset.

424
00:25:06,538 --> 00:25:07,812
What else did he say?

425
00:25:07,873 --> 00:25:12,288
He said he wanted to know what
stop we were on the Broadway IRT.

426
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:22,089
Did you receive any other angry phone
calls for Mr. Kopinsky that day?

427
00:25:22,154 --> 00:25:24,430
There was always somebody
upset about something.

428
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:28,267
Well, you'd heard other clients call
Mr. Kopinsky a crook, hadn't you?

429
00:25:28,327 --> 00:25:30,568
He cut some corners.

430
00:25:30,629 --> 00:25:34,702
In a typical week how many angry phone
calls would Mr. Kopinsky receive?

431
00:25:34,767 --> 00:25:35,802
Maybe a dozen.

432
00:25:35,868 --> 00:25:38,314
That's two or three
angry phone calls a day.

433
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,441
Oh, yeah. At least that.

434
00:25:42,941 --> 00:25:47,412
BELL: Miss Huntley, your company, Empire
Gifts, was being sued by Arthur Kopinsky?

435
00:25:47,479 --> 00:25:51,052
Yes. On behalf of a man
named Carl Piselli.

436
00:25:51,116 --> 00:25:52,561
And the police
came to question you

437
00:25:52,618 --> 00:25:54,791
during their investigation
of Mr. Kopinsky's death?

438
00:25:54,853 --> 00:25:55,888
Yes.

439
00:25:55,955 --> 00:25:58,435
Did they indicate to you they
had a suspect in the murder?

440
00:25:58,490 --> 00:25:59,992
Objection, Your Honor.
Relevance.

441
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:02,471
If someone other than Mr. Curren
killed Arthur Kopinsky,

442
00:26:02,528 --> 00:26:04,007
I would say
that's highly relevant.

443
00:26:04,063 --> 00:26:05,974
If Miss Bell wants to know
what the police thought

444
00:26:06,031 --> 00:26:08,136
about this case at various
points in ancient history,

445
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,338
she ought to ask them.

446
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:12,382
Now? After they've circled their
wagons around Mr. Curren?

447
00:26:12,438 --> 00:26:14,941
Your objection is overruled,
Mr. McCoy.

448
00:26:15,007 --> 00:26:18,284
If you wish, you can bring
on the police to rebut.

449
00:26:20,145 --> 00:26:23,354
Did the police indicate to you
they had a suspect, Miss Huntley?

450
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:25,258
Yes. Carl Piselli.

451
00:26:25,317 --> 00:26:28,696
Not John Curren?
No. They didn't mention him.

452
00:26:29,721 --> 00:26:34,067
Did you yourself ever hear Mr. Piselli
make any threats against Mr. Kopinsky?

453
00:26:34,126 --> 00:26:35,196
Yes.

454
00:26:35,461 --> 00:26:38,499
He said that Mr. Kopinsky was
cheating him by taking his money

455
00:26:38,564 --> 00:26:41,408
and not pursuing
his case against me.

456
00:26:41,467 --> 00:26:44,414
Would you consider Mr. Piselli
a violent man?

457
00:26:47,206 --> 00:26:52,781
Two times he came into my showroom and
yelled at my staff and smashed things.

458
00:26:54,013 --> 00:26:55,356
Thank you.

459
00:26:56,415 --> 00:26:58,691
Miss Huntley,
you don't know anything

460
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:03,256
that would indicate that Mr. Piselli
killed Mr. Kopinsky, do you?

461
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:06,360
No.
And you don't know anything

462
00:27:06,425 --> 00:27:09,872
that would indicate that Mr. Curren
didn't kill him, do you?

463
00:27:11,363 --> 00:27:12,398
No.

464
00:27:13,732 --> 00:27:15,075
Thank you.

465
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:19,275
Miss Bell, if you have no redirect,
we'll recess until tomorrow.

466
00:27:21,273 --> 00:27:23,048
(GAVEL BANGS)

467
00:27:29,114 --> 00:27:33,460
Still won't give a girl a break, huh, Jack?
It's all smoke, Sally.

468
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:35,021
The jury won't buy any of it.

469
00:27:35,087 --> 00:27:38,432
I think the jurors start with
a very reasonable reluctance

470
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:40,128
to believe anything you say.

471
00:27:40,192 --> 00:27:41,796
Me personally?
No, the system, Jack.

472
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:44,966
It's wrong so often.
Which reminds me.

473
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:49,669
It's an addition
to my witness list.

474
00:27:55,774 --> 00:27:57,447
What do you do, Miss Maney?

475
00:27:57,509 --> 00:28:00,217
I'm an assistant manager
of Security Central Bank.

476
00:28:00,279 --> 00:28:01,314
The branch in Inwood.

477
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:03,986
Where Mr. Curren and his mother
maintain checking accounts?

478
00:28:04,049 --> 00:28:07,553
That's right. He has power
of attorney over hers.

479
00:28:07,619 --> 00:28:11,123
Did you see Mr. Curren the morning of
the day Mr. Kopinsky was murdered?

480
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:15,195
Yes. He came in and stopped payment
on a check his mother had written.

481
00:28:20,966 --> 00:28:22,809
This check,
People's exhibit four,

482
00:28:22,868 --> 00:28:25,906
made out to Arthur Kopinsky
for $3,000.

483
00:28:26,472 --> 00:28:27,542
Yes.

484
00:28:27,606 --> 00:28:31,053
He said the person had cheated his
mother and she didn't want to pay him.

485
00:28:31,109 --> 00:28:35,888
So, Mr. Curren had no reason to
kill anyone to retrieve this check?

486
00:28:36,348 --> 00:28:37,725
It was worthless.

487
00:28:37,783 --> 00:28:40,093
Mr. Curren knew that?
Of course.

488
00:28:40,152 --> 00:28:42,758
I took care of the paperwork
while he waited.

489
00:28:42,821 --> 00:28:44,630
No further questions.

490
00:28:46,225 --> 00:28:50,230
Was Mr. Curren at all upset that
this person had cheated his mother?

491
00:28:50,295 --> 00:28:52,798
Yes. Very.
What did he say?

492
00:28:55,167 --> 00:28:58,910
He said the man was dishonest
and he ought to be arrested.

493
00:29:07,613 --> 00:29:10,560
I'm beginning to think the defense
case is rather convincing.

494
00:29:10,616 --> 00:29:13,893
A smart lawyer can always find holes.
Holes, yeah.

495
00:29:13,952 --> 00:29:16,057
You never found
the murder weapon.

496
00:29:16,121 --> 00:29:20,069
You don't have a witness to this shooting.
You don't even have a motive anymore.

497
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:23,436
Even if the check was stopped, Curren
still had a grudge against Kopinsky.

498
00:29:23,495 --> 00:29:25,031
A grudge? Yeah.

499
00:29:25,097 --> 00:29:28,635
It sounds like everyone in New York
City had a grudge against this man.

500
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:32,807
Are you sure that that's the murderer
sitting there at the defense table?

501
00:29:33,872 --> 00:29:38,082
Right. Get a continuance.
Start at square one.

502
00:29:38,143 --> 00:29:40,987
Either prove you got the right
man or prove you don't.

503
00:29:41,046 --> 00:29:42,650
Have a nice day.

504
00:29:44,283 --> 00:29:47,196
Everything Kopinsky was working
on the last month of his life.

505
00:29:47,252 --> 00:29:49,357
The Tappan stuff is there.

506
00:29:50,088 --> 00:29:52,125
"Piselli v. Empire Gifts."

507
00:29:52,991 --> 00:29:54,766
You go through
this one already?

508
00:29:54,826 --> 00:29:58,433
The police already investigated
Piselli and cleared him.

509
00:29:58,497 --> 00:29:59,840
Pretty fat.

510
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:03,708
Wasn't Piselli complaining that
Kopinsky wasn't doing anything?

511
00:30:03,769 --> 00:30:04,975
Yes.

512
00:30:06,238 --> 00:30:10,311
But Kopinsky's roommate told the police
he was working on it night and day.

513
00:30:10,942 --> 00:30:14,287
Interrogatories, deposition
notices, subpoenas.

514
00:30:14,947 --> 00:30:16,984
Why didn't he tell Piselli
what he was doing?

515
00:30:17,049 --> 00:30:20,121
He hadn't even gone to trial,
let alone got a judgment.

516
00:30:20,719 --> 00:30:25,099
He was already examining the gift
company's assets. Bank records.

517
00:30:30,529 --> 00:30:34,170
And he hired a private investigator
to follow Alice Huntley.

518
00:30:35,367 --> 00:30:40,339
Surveillance log. Circled in red.
Three visits to West End CCC.

519
00:30:42,341 --> 00:30:47,552
Community Correction Center. That's
Willard Tappan's halfway house.

520
00:30:51,883 --> 00:30:55,126
LEONARD: Kopinsky didn't tell
me his secret hopes and dreams.

521
00:30:55,187 --> 00:30:58,566
He just asked me to follow her.
You have no idea why?

522
00:30:58,624 --> 00:31:02,538
When I saw her bumping butts with
Willard Tappan at the halfway house,

523
00:31:02,594 --> 00:31:04,596
the light began to dawn.

524
00:31:05,764 --> 00:31:08,404
"Bumping butts"?
Pardon my French.

525
00:31:09,067 --> 00:31:12,276
While I was pretending to look for
my brother in the guest book,

526
00:31:12,337 --> 00:31:15,113
I saw Tappan
sneak her upstairs.

527
00:31:15,173 --> 00:31:18,120
I didn't think he was gonna
show her his stamp collection.

528
00:31:18,176 --> 00:31:20,178
How long
has this been going on?

529
00:31:20,245 --> 00:31:23,624
I dug up some old personnel
files from Tappan's bank.

530
00:31:24,583 --> 00:31:28,656
She was in his public relations
department. Cute, huh?

531
00:31:29,788 --> 00:31:32,359
You heard my testimony.
I talked to the police.

532
00:31:32,424 --> 00:31:35,894
They hadn't seen your bank records.
But Kopinsky had.

533
00:31:36,528 --> 00:31:39,907
Your company's gross profit
is $300,000 a year.

534
00:31:39,965 --> 00:31:42,411
But you have $5 million
on deposit.

535
00:31:42,467 --> 00:31:46,347
Most of it's a loan from a bank
in the Netherlands Antilles.

536
00:31:46,405 --> 00:31:49,784
I'm planning on expanding.
It's a sound business loan.

537
00:31:49,841 --> 00:31:52,481
You've never made
a single payment.

538
00:31:52,544 --> 00:31:55,889
It comes from a place
with strict bank secrecy laws.

539
00:31:57,049 --> 00:32:02,727
I file full tax returns. I have a
successful legitimate business.

540
00:32:02,788 --> 00:32:04,461
You know what I think,
Miss Huntley?

541
00:32:04,523 --> 00:32:08,198
I think Willard Tappan, your boyfriend,
stashed this money in the West Indies

542
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:09,830
in his good old days.

543
00:32:09,895 --> 00:32:13,843
And this loan to your company
is just a way of laundering it.

544
00:32:15,167 --> 00:32:17,408
I barely know Mr. Tappan.

545
00:32:20,372 --> 00:32:23,376
Did he just use you for criminal
conspiracy, fraud and sex,

546
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:26,047
or did he also
involve you in murder?

547
00:32:27,412 --> 00:32:29,323
I don't have time to play
games, Miss Huntley.

548
00:32:29,381 --> 00:32:32,794
I'll just charge you and let
the chips fall where they may.

549
00:32:36,021 --> 00:32:38,968
Did Tappan know
Kopinsky had found his money?

550
00:32:45,163 --> 00:32:49,134
Willard said that
it would never be traced,

551
00:32:50,001 --> 00:32:52,948
because no one knew
that we were involved.

552
00:32:53,005 --> 00:32:56,509
Your bad luck. Kopinsky had a
nose for this kind of thing.

553
00:32:57,209 --> 00:32:59,712
He said he would stall
his clients.

554
00:33:00,479 --> 00:33:05,053
Willard had me give him
$50,000 out of the account.

555
00:33:05,851 --> 00:33:09,389
Then $100,000.
Kopinsky came back for more?

556
00:33:10,722 --> 00:33:13,999
And how did your boyfriend
enjoy being blackmailed?

557
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:18,304
Willard wouldn't shoot someone.

558
00:33:19,464 --> 00:33:22,104
Are you sure about that,
Miss Huntley?

559
00:33:29,608 --> 00:33:31,349
If I had a secret bank account,

560
00:33:31,409 --> 00:33:33,286
don't you think
I'd use the Cayman Islands?

561
00:33:33,345 --> 00:33:35,382
The laws are so much more
favorable there.

562
00:33:35,447 --> 00:33:38,087
Mr. Tappan was required
to relinquish all his accounts

563
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:41,029
as a result of his plea bargain
five years ago, and he did so.

564
00:33:41,086 --> 00:33:45,000
That's not what Alice Huntley says.
Miss Huntley is a spurned lover.

565
00:33:45,056 --> 00:33:47,502
Mr. Tappan has recently become
engaged to another woman.

566
00:33:47,559 --> 00:33:49,436
He met her in jail?

567
00:33:49,494 --> 00:33:53,306
No, an old family friend
who has always stood by me.

568
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:55,871
This whole thing
is very confusing, Mr. McCoy.

569
00:33:55,934 --> 00:33:59,143
Don't you have someone else on trial
for the murder of Arthur Kopinsky?

570
00:33:59,204 --> 00:34:01,013
We got a continuance.

571
00:34:02,407 --> 00:34:04,444
Mr. Tappan, would you mind
telling us where you were

572
00:34:04,509 --> 00:34:06,386
the night Mr. Kopinsky
was shot?

573
00:34:06,445 --> 00:34:08,721
Not at all. I have no idea,

574
00:34:09,414 --> 00:34:12,554
but I'm sure the office staff at
the halfway house can tell you.

575
00:34:12,617 --> 00:34:16,895
They're very efficient
at monitoring our movements.

576
00:34:20,625 --> 00:34:24,004
Every time they leave the halfway
house, they bring back a signed slip.

577
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:28,511
When Kopinsky was shot, Tappan was
at a pre-release Life Skills class.

578
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:32,378
Learning how to buy a bus
transfer and use a cash machine.

579
00:34:32,437 --> 00:34:33,677
His alibi is solid.

580
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:36,412
So we've got Tappan with
motive but no opportunity,

581
00:34:36,474 --> 00:34:38,852
and Curren with opportunity
but no motive.

582
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:40,856
But what if we
put them together?

583
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:45,224
A pay phone outside Curren's office.
6:00 p.m. The day of the murder.

584
00:34:45,283 --> 00:34:47,923
A 12-minute call
to the halfway house.

585
00:34:48,553 --> 00:34:50,032
Good, Claire.

586
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:54,293
That day would be
in this book here.

587
00:34:56,628 --> 00:35:00,633
This isn't my usual line of work.
I'm a surgeon.

588
00:35:02,634 --> 00:35:06,275
Medicaid fraud.
Well, here it is.

589
00:35:07,539 --> 00:35:11,248
I remember this call.
What did the caller say?

590
00:35:11,309 --> 00:35:14,153
He was carrying on. I would
have prescribed sedation.

591
00:35:14,212 --> 00:35:17,284
Said he was an old friend of Tappan's,
but he wouldn't give his name.

592
00:35:17,349 --> 00:35:19,295
But you put the call through?
Yeah, why not?

593
00:35:19,351 --> 00:35:22,491
Tappan was playing ping-pong.
I gave him the phone.

594
00:35:22,554 --> 00:35:25,660
What did Tappan say to him?
I don't know.

595
00:35:26,725 --> 00:35:28,796
He must have been
standing right here.

596
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:33,809
First thing I learned in prison, miss.
Don't eavesdrop on the phones.

597
00:35:35,233 --> 00:35:37,110
The timing is perfect.

598
00:35:37,702 --> 00:35:41,149
Curren talks to Tappan. An hour
later he's in Kopinsky's office.

599
00:35:41,206 --> 00:35:43,618
And that includes a half-hour
ride on the subway.

600
00:35:43,675 --> 00:35:47,350
You think that this call was prearranged?
CLAIRE: Not necessarily.

601
00:35:47,412 --> 00:35:50,757
Curren knew where Tappan was.
It was in the papers.

602
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:53,659
Curren thought Kopinsky
was a fraud.

603
00:35:53,718 --> 00:35:56,494
He'd lost his last hope of getting
his money back from Tappan.

604
00:35:56,554 --> 00:35:59,626
Maybe he just decided
to go straight to the source.

605
00:35:59,691 --> 00:36:04,197
And ask him for a refund?
Or beg him. Or scream at him.

606
00:36:05,197 --> 00:36:09,077
Or lure him out to be killed. Or
maybe just cry into the phone.

607
00:36:09,134 --> 00:36:11,171
But something Tappan said

608
00:36:11,236 --> 00:36:14,046
sent Curren down to
Kopinsky's office with a gun.

609
00:36:15,774 --> 00:36:20,416
What if Tappan told Curren that Kopinsky
wasn't lying about finding Tappan's money?

610
00:36:20,478 --> 00:36:24,483
That he'd actually found it, but
that he was keeping it from Curren?

611
00:36:24,683 --> 00:36:27,289
That would've set him off.
Yeah, sure.

612
00:36:27,719 --> 00:36:30,290
And if that's what happened,
do you think he'd tell you?

613
00:36:30,355 --> 00:36:33,461
He'd be hanging himself.
Tappan knows what he said.

614
00:36:33,525 --> 00:36:37,871
And he can't tell this story without
including the part about his hidden money

615
00:36:37,929 --> 00:36:42,503
which earns him a fresh charge of
fraud and a spanking new jail term.

616
00:36:47,772 --> 00:36:50,776
Take a break, Julio.
All right, Mr. Tappan.

617
00:36:52,444 --> 00:36:55,482
You know, they're talking
about privatizing the park.

618
00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:58,653
A subway token
to enter or $30 a year.

619
00:36:59,417 --> 00:37:03,126
Trump thinks he can run it at a profit.
That's fascinating.

620
00:37:03,588 --> 00:37:07,092
We're here to... You're here
because you have a problem.

621
00:37:07,158 --> 00:37:09,934
I'm talking to you
because I have a problem.

622
00:37:09,995 --> 00:37:12,134
We'll prove you hid
that money, Mr. Tappan.

623
00:37:12,197 --> 00:37:15,269
That'll prolong your study
of institutional dining.

624
00:37:15,333 --> 00:37:17,438
Yes. That's my problem.

625
00:37:17,502 --> 00:37:20,642
Meanwhile, Mr. Curren,
your murderer, will go free.

626
00:37:20,705 --> 00:37:23,743
If you hadn't stolen his money that
murder would never have taken place.

627
00:37:23,808 --> 00:37:24,912
I concede your point.

628
00:37:24,976 --> 00:37:27,388
If things were different,
they wouldn't be the same.

629
00:37:27,445 --> 00:37:29,925
Look, I know
that you've been asking

630
00:37:29,981 --> 00:37:33,394
about a conversation I may
have had with Mr. Curren,

631
00:37:33,451 --> 00:37:37,524
a conversation
I may not be able to recall.

632
00:37:38,290 --> 00:37:40,736
I saw your testimony to the
House Banking Committee.

633
00:37:40,792 --> 00:37:44,171
You couldn't seem to recall the
answers to more than 200 questions.

634
00:37:44,229 --> 00:37:45,731
My memory is dreadful.

635
00:37:45,797 --> 00:37:48,334
Especially when I'm anxious
about the future.

636
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,778
What do you want?
No prosecution on fraud.

637
00:37:50,835 --> 00:37:53,213
We take your money.
You'll take it anyway.

638
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:55,478
And you would remember what?

639
00:37:55,540 --> 00:38:01,252
It's possible that I spoke with
Mr. Curren, that he was semi-hysterical,

640
00:38:01,312 --> 00:38:06,091
that, to amuse myself, I suggested that
he talk to my attorney, Arthur Kopinsky.

641
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:10,664
You told him you
were hooked up with Kopinsky?

642
00:38:10,722 --> 00:38:13,328
Kopinsky hadn't exactly
endeared himself to me.

643
00:38:13,391 --> 00:38:15,803
I thought he might enjoy
meeting Mr. Curren.

644
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:18,773
You hoped Curren would kill
him to end the blackmail.

645
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:21,674
Heavens to Betsy,
what a dreadful idea.

646
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:27,209
You think Tappan planned it?

647
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:31,253
Curren was dynamite.

648
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:35,348
Tappan mailed him to Kopinsky and
hoped somebody would light a match.

649
00:38:35,413 --> 00:38:39,156
And we have to deal with a man like
that to convict a sap like Curren.

650
00:38:39,217 --> 00:38:41,857
Tappan is responsible
for that murder.

651
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:45,324
Morally, not legally.
We can't arrest him.

652
00:38:46,224 --> 00:38:48,670
I'm a DA.
I can arrest anybody.

653
00:38:50,095 --> 00:38:54,271
Well, Jack, I tell you, I dislike
Willard Tappan as much as you,

654
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:57,307
but charging him with murder?

655
00:38:57,636 --> 00:39:01,709
Five people committed suicide when
Tappan destroyed their savings.

656
00:39:03,074 --> 00:39:05,953
He's lucky we're only
charging him with one murder.

657
00:39:06,211 --> 00:39:08,350
Well, how do you
propose to do this?

658
00:39:08,413 --> 00:39:10,791
Curren calls Tappan.
He's raging. He's homicidal.

659
00:39:10,849 --> 00:39:13,159
Maybe even says he's got a gun.

660
00:39:13,585 --> 00:39:15,929
He tells Tappan
he was swindled by Kopinsky.

661
00:39:15,987 --> 00:39:19,628
Tappan says, "No, no, no, Mr. Kopinsky
didn't double-cross you."

662
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:21,796
"He triple-crossed you.
He's got my money."

663
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:24,841
"Why don't you go see him?
And tell him I said hi."

664
00:39:24,896 --> 00:39:28,207
That's evincing a depraved indifference
to Arthur Kopinsky's life.

665
00:39:28,266 --> 00:39:31,804
And it led to his death. It's statutory.
I understand.

666
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:34,541
You think you can prove it?

667
00:39:35,707 --> 00:39:37,516
I'd sure like to try.

668
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:40,450
You want me to testify
about that phone call?

669
00:39:40,512 --> 00:39:42,514
Against Willard Tappan?

670
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:45,083
We arrested him for the
murder of Arthur Kopinsky.

671
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:47,687
Excellent. So when does
my client get out of here?

672
00:39:47,752 --> 00:39:51,632
In eight-and-a-third years after he
serves his sentence for manslaughter.

673
00:39:51,689 --> 00:39:53,896
Didn't you just say
that Tappan is your killer?

674
00:39:53,958 --> 00:39:55,665
JACK:
Curren pulled the trigger.

675
00:39:56,428 --> 00:40:00,877
If he doesn't testify against Willard Tappan,
Willard Tappan will testify against him.

676
00:40:00,932 --> 00:40:03,572
That's blackmail.
You would go that low?

677
00:40:03,635 --> 00:40:05,512
Don't you know me by now,
Sally?

678
00:40:08,773 --> 00:40:11,720
I'll do it to get Tappan.

679
00:40:13,378 --> 00:40:17,155
So what was that all about?
What was what all about?

680
00:40:17,215 --> 00:40:21,789
"Don't you know me by now?"
Oh. Sally.

681
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:25,629
Yes. Sally. Miss Bell,
our opposing counsel?

682
00:40:26,391 --> 00:40:28,234
She was my assistant.

683
00:40:32,297 --> 00:40:35,244
CURREN: I don't even know
why I called him. I just...

684
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:39,009
I knew where he was, and I
blamed him for everything.

685
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:42,108
What was Mr. Tappan's
reaction to hearing from you?

686
00:40:42,173 --> 00:40:45,484
He thought it was funny at first.
And then?

687
00:40:45,543 --> 00:40:50,617
Well, I started talking about Kopinsky.
He said that he knew Kopinsky,

688
00:40:50,682 --> 00:40:53,322
that Kopinsky
had found his money,

689
00:40:53,384 --> 00:40:55,386
and now he was planning
to keep it all for himself.

690
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:58,696
So there'd be nothing left for me.
Nothing left for anybody.

691
00:40:58,756 --> 00:41:01,464
What did you say?
I was stunned.

692
00:41:01,526 --> 00:41:04,769
I had assumed that Kopinsky
was lying about everything.

693
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:08,169
And what did Mr. Tappan say?

694
00:41:08,766 --> 00:41:12,213
He said he was sorry
for what he'd done to us.

695
00:41:12,837 --> 00:41:17,445
That he now understood how terrible it
was to steal somebody's lifesavings.

696
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:24,826
And then he said that he'd pay us back,
my mother and me. Every cent, if...

697
00:41:26,751 --> 00:41:28,025
If what?

698
00:41:32,724 --> 00:41:34,670
If I killed Kopinsky.

699
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,764
What did you do?

700
00:41:40,698 --> 00:41:42,006
I did it.

701
00:41:43,801 --> 00:41:46,145
I went downtown and I shot him.

702
00:41:50,441 --> 00:41:51,784
Thank you.

703
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:59,350
You hate Willard Tappan, don't you?
Yes.

704
00:42:00,551 --> 00:42:02,827
Wouldn't you lie to hurt him?

705
00:42:02,887 --> 00:42:04,764
No.
Oh, really?

706
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:08,230
You get off easy for a
murder that you committed,

707
00:42:08,293 --> 00:42:11,240
and the man you hate goes to
jail for the rest of his life.

708
00:42:11,296 --> 00:42:13,572
Isn't that perfect?
Perfect?

709
00:42:15,333 --> 00:42:19,145
Perfect would have been
if I'd never heard of him,

710
00:42:19,204 --> 00:42:20,911
because, you see,
then I would be living

711
00:42:20,972 --> 00:42:23,714
in a three-bedroom house
in a nice neighborhood,

712
00:42:23,775 --> 00:42:28,383
and I would be able to watch my children
riding their bicycles in the driveway.

713
00:42:28,446 --> 00:42:30,983
But Mr. Tappan
took all that away from you.

714
00:42:31,049 --> 00:42:34,963
For him I guess it was just another
zero on a list of numbers.

715
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:36,863
For us...

716
00:42:39,023 --> 00:42:40,696
it was everything.

717
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:46,601
He went on and on. I was a thief.
I was a monster.

718
00:42:46,664 --> 00:42:48,803
I might have been the devil
himself, I'm not sure.

719
00:42:48,866 --> 00:42:51,938
Did you offer to pay John Curren
to murder Arthur Kopinsky?

720
00:42:52,003 --> 00:42:53,607
Absolutely not.

721
00:42:53,671 --> 00:42:57,209
Did you in any way suggest
that he kill Arthur Kopinsky?

722
00:42:57,608 --> 00:42:58,746
No.

723
00:42:58,810 --> 00:43:01,518
He was raving about Kopinsky
before I said a word.

724
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:03,889
Kopinsky'd just swindled him.
He'd swindled his mother.

725
00:43:03,948 --> 00:43:06,895
He was deranged about it.

726
00:43:06,951 --> 00:43:10,330
Then Mr. Curren is lying about the
content of your conversation?

727
00:43:10,388 --> 00:43:15,201
He blames me for ruining his life because
he lost money in my institution.

728
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:17,240
What did you say to him?

729
00:43:17,295 --> 00:43:22,301
His family had lost under a million dollars.
I lost over a hundred million.

730
00:43:23,334 --> 00:43:25,211
I told him to grow up.

731
00:43:26,104 --> 00:43:27,481
Thank you.

732
00:43:28,806 --> 00:43:31,685
How many people
have you swindled, Mr. Tappan?

733
00:43:31,743 --> 00:43:32,881
None.

734
00:43:34,178 --> 00:43:37,557
How many people have you
been convicted of swindling?

735
00:43:38,116 --> 00:43:39,493
14,000.

736
00:43:40,051 --> 00:43:43,294
14,000 people you lied to

737
00:43:43,354 --> 00:43:46,028
when they bought bonds in
North River Savings and Loan?

738
00:43:46,090 --> 00:43:47,865
Objection. Argumentative.

739
00:43:47,925 --> 00:43:50,701
Addresses credibility.
Overruled.

740
00:43:50,762 --> 00:43:53,971
Why should anyone believe
anything you tell them now

741
00:43:54,032 --> 00:43:57,036
since you've been convicted
of lying 14,000 times?

742
00:43:57,101 --> 00:43:59,377
I never lied to those people.

743
00:43:59,437 --> 00:44:03,385
Those bondholders were investors.
Investors take risks.

744
00:44:03,941 --> 00:44:07,286
Nobody complained when my
business was making them money.

745
00:44:07,345 --> 00:44:10,224
John Curren
lost his lifesavings.

746
00:44:10,281 --> 00:44:13,819
Because the real estate
market collapsed, Mr. McCoy.

747
00:44:13,885 --> 00:44:16,024
That was beyond my control.

748
00:44:21,926 --> 00:44:23,496
You didn't make this guy blink.

749
00:44:23,561 --> 00:44:25,939
It doesn't matter. Willard
Tappan will be convicted.

750
00:44:25,997 --> 00:44:28,876
Right. After the judge
reminds the jury

751
00:44:28,933 --> 00:44:31,607
that he's not on trial for
anything he did in the past

752
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:34,809
and orders them
to put it out of their mind.

753
00:44:34,872 --> 00:44:37,819
Adam, you haven't been in a
courtroom in a long time.

754
00:44:37,875 --> 00:44:41,413
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
You didn't see their eyes.

755
00:44:41,479 --> 00:44:42,890
When they get into
that jury room,

756
00:44:42,947 --> 00:44:45,860
the only thing they'll
remember is the 14,000 lies.

757
00:44:45,917 --> 00:44:47,453
Right, sure.

758
00:44:51,255 --> 00:44:54,429
JUDGE MOONEY: And this is most important.
The defendant, Willard Tappan,

759
00:44:54,492 --> 00:44:58,998
is on trial here for the murder of
Arthur Kopinsky, and that crime only.

760
00:44:59,063 --> 00:45:00,542
Anything he did in the past,

761
00:45:00,598 --> 00:45:02,271
anything you may have heard
about his past,

762
00:45:02,333 --> 00:45:06,076
any feelings you may have
about his past activities

763
00:45:06,137 --> 00:45:08,174
are absolutely irrelevant.

764
00:45:08,873 --> 00:45:13,549
In making your decision, therefore, you
are instructed to give them no weight.

765
00:45:20,885 --> 00:45:24,230
JUDGE MOONEY: Mr. Foreman, has
the jury reached a verdict?

766
00:45:24,288 --> 00:45:27,735
We have, Your Honor. On the
sole count of the indictment,

767
00:45:27,792 --> 00:45:30,739
murder in the second degree,
how do you find?

768
00:45:31,496 --> 00:45:34,807
We find the defendant,
Willard Tappan, guilty.

769
00:45:35,199 --> 00:45:37,577
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)

770
00:45:51,249 --> 00:45:53,160
Did you know we had it?

771
00:45:54,519 --> 00:45:59,730
Well, between Curren and Tappan,
who's a jury gonna believe?

772
00:46:00,324 --> 00:46:02,065
Who do you believe?

773
00:46:03,394 --> 00:46:06,967
Me, too. Curren's story
was awfully convenient.

774
00:46:07,031 --> 00:46:10,774
But under our original theory
Tappan is still guilty of murder.

775
00:46:10,835 --> 00:46:12,906
He manipulated Curren.

776
00:46:12,970 --> 00:46:15,450
Jack, we made it sound
like he hired Curren.

777
00:46:15,506 --> 00:46:19,386
If you didn't believe that but let
it go on to strengthen our case...

778
00:46:19,444 --> 00:46:22,653
Heavens to Betsy, Claire.
What a dreadful idea.
