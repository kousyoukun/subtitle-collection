In the criminal justice system

2
00:00:04,538 --> 00:00:08,384
the people are represented by two
separate yet equally important groups,

3
00:00:08,442 --> 00:00:10,319
the police
who investigate crime

4
00:00:10,377 --> 00:00:13,187
and the district attorneys
who prosecute the offenders.

5
00:00:13,247 --> 00:00:14,954
These are their stories.

6
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:19,028
Where did you find that trey,
in your Christmas stocking?

7
00:00:19,086 --> 00:00:21,794
If I'm not mistaken, I hit
four tonight out of seven.

8
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:24,233
Would've been perfect if you'd have
kept your hands out of my face.

9

Hey, I didn't hear
any whistles blowing.

10
00:00:25,926 --> 00:00:29,100
Yeah, well, the ref's too busy
watching girls' volleyball now.

Oh, two overtimes?
My wife's gonna kill me.

13
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,407
I better let her know
I'm alive, huh?

14
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:37,312
Next week.
Yeah.

15
00:00:46,513 --> 00:00:47,924
Dear? Hi.

16
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:51,226
Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah, I know, I know.

17
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:53,823
Well, what do you feel like?

00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:59,833
What? Nothing. No.

20
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:03,270
Hey, look, I'll take a
taxicab home, okay?

21
00:01:03,463 --> 00:01:04,874
Yeah. Bye.

(SIRENS WAILING) Are you sure
you didn't see anything?

25
00:01:29,323 --> 00:01:34,295
No, I was inside, like I told the other guy.
We played some ball, I called my wife.

26
00:01:34,361 --> 00:01:37,001
We played full-court
every week the last year.

Yeah? Did you know
his next of kin?

28
00:01:39,566 --> 00:01:42,945
No, we never really talked about anything.
All I know is he lived by himself.

A numbers cruncher
for the Park Department.

30

I can't believe this.
He asked me to get a pizza.

31
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:51,923
Look, this is my card.

32
00:01:51,979 --> 00:01:54,050
If you do remember anything
else, give me a buzz, okay?

33
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:55,491
Thank you.

Deidre's got something for you.

40
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:16,843
There was this black car that
was double-parked over there.

41

Client of yours?
A Lincoln? Yeah, I wish.

42

I knocked on the tinted window,
and the jerk behind the wheel,

43
00:02:22,743 --> 00:02:24,654
I mean, he wouldn't even
give me a roll down.

44
00:02:24,711 --> 00:02:26,315
Obviously he didn't know
what he was missing.

45
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:28,018
Yeah, well, you got that right.

and I see some guy
jumping into the back seat.

49
00:02:34,955 --> 00:02:38,129
Did you see his face?
No, I saw him from behind.

50
00:02:38,225 --> 00:02:41,229
He was built regular, like a
thousand other guys I know,

51

You know, I wouldn't be surprised
if you got a call from the Mayor.

Yeah, well, he's paying
like everybody else.

don't know why anybody still lives here.

I don't know,
three pops to the chest?

60

You want to grab a guy's wallet,
one would've done the job.

61
00:03:58,171 --> 00:04:01,345
Maybe our guy got antsy.
Or maybe it wasn't random.

The hooker said the car
was parked outside the gym.

63

months ago of a heart attack

on the 16th hole.

Well, there's still a car
registered in your husband's name.

Well, I'm sorry. The DMV wasn't
one of my bigger priorities.

73
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:36,777
What's this all about, anyway?

74
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:41,383
Well, your car has been identified as
the getaway vehicle in a homicide.

Oh, there must be a mistake.

Harry was the only one
that ever drove that car.

Your husband died six months ago,
and no one's used that car since?

No.

she never drives it.

Well, the only time
she ever comes by

is the first of the month

themselves to a fake ID.

them dust it for prints.

Yeah, telephone's over there.

Now, are these all monthlies?

94
00:05:32,566 --> 00:05:35,342
Most. The rest are first come
and first serve.

00:05:35,402 --> 00:05:37,382
Okay. You got receipts on them?
Tickets.

00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:40,145
Yesterday maybe 20, 30.
They're in the office.

What'd you guys do? Simoniz the Lincoln
before you called us down here?

98
00:05:44,211 --> 00:05:46,122
So, you're saying
you got nothing, right?

99

as a baby's bottom.

Twice for resisting arrest, once
for voluntary manslaughter.

00:06:14,574 --> 00:06:16,076
So, what? Nothing stuck?

108
00:06:16,142 --> 00:06:17,712
Seems to run in the family.

109
00:06:17,777 --> 00:06:19,313
What, you got his whole
genealogy in there?

110
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:24,192
As a matter of fact, I do. Furini's a

our time to even get one.

153
00:08:17,597 --> 00:08:18,598
Dave was competent.

154
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:20,906
Did he ever mention
a guy named John Furini?

155
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:23,379
Is he in accounting?
I doubt it.

156
00:08:24,571 --> 00:08:27,711
So, tell me, what skeletons
did Dave have in his closet?

157
00:08:27,774 --> 00:08:31,688
Actually, that's what we're here to ask you.
Did he gamble? Drink?

158
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:33,586
Nothing I know about.

159
00:08:33,647 --> 00:08:35,991
Girlfriend?
No, his daughter Emily.

160
00:08:36,282 --> 00:08:38,284
She's away
at some fancy school.

161
00:08:38,418 --> 00:08:41,160
We didn't even know he was married.
He wasn't.

162
00:08:41,588 --> 00:08:44,535
His wife divorced him
about three years ago.

163
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,099
Whoever did it
must be disappointed.

164
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,231
Excuse me?
Picked the wrong guy to mug.

165
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:52,003
David never carried
more than $10 in his wallet.

166
00:08:52,065 --> 00:08:54,136
Hell, he never had
more than $10.

167
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,511
Well, you never get rich working for the city.
Believe me, I know.

168
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:59,880
Did he fall behind
in his payments?

169
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:02,208
He did his best.

170
00:09:02,342 --> 00:09:03,946
That's very
understanding of you.

171
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:06,456
Look, we were married
for 21 years.

172
00:09:06,513 --> 00:09:10,723
It was great for one, good for
two, maybe C+ for the rest.

173
00:09:11,151 --> 00:09:12,528
A lot of fighting?

174
00:09:13,453 --> 00:09:17,026
Wait a minute. Do you think...
No, I'm not thinking anything,

175
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:19,661
but I gotta ask.
I wish we fought.

176
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:23,107
At least then he might have
shown some passion.

177
00:09:23,163 --> 00:09:25,507
David went to work.
He came home.

178
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,408
The only two things
he got excited about

179
00:09:27,467 --> 00:09:30,448
were his weekly basketball
and our daughter Emily.

180
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:33,313
Every nickel he made
went into her education.

181
00:09:33,373 --> 00:09:35,410
State college
wasn't good enough.

182
00:09:35,475 --> 00:09:40,083
Private school. Wow, that's gotta
be about 20 grand per, huh?

183
00:09:40,447 --> 00:09:42,654
If you don't plan
on eating anything.

184
00:09:42,715 --> 00:09:45,093
Did he have any
outside sources of income?

185
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:47,392
Like I said,
every penny went to Em.

186
00:09:47,454 --> 00:09:50,799
If he had anything else, she
wouldn't be driving an '83 Buick.

187
00:09:50,857 --> 00:09:53,895
All her classmates drive BMWs.

188
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,236
Your husband...
My ex-husband.

189
00:09:56,296 --> 00:09:59,607
Ex-husband. Did he ever
mention a John Furini?

190
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:04,377
But then again, we hadn't
talked in over a year.

191
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:06,883
Since Emily's
19th birthday party.

192
00:10:08,641 --> 00:10:10,382
So, what's it all about,
Lennie?

193
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:13,287
Would you bust your butt
to buy your kid a Bimmer?

194
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:15,655
Nothing wrong with wanting
the best for your daughter.

195
00:10:15,715 --> 00:10:16,853
Right.

196
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:19,260
I like those pair of
Converses you bought Julia.

197
00:10:19,319 --> 00:10:21,265
Well, they're the best, right?

198
00:10:21,321 --> 00:10:23,767
All I know is,
no German cars for my kid.

199
00:10:23,823 --> 00:10:26,030
Your kid? What, Rollerblades?

200
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:28,134
We're talking Vette, baby.

201
00:10:28,895 --> 00:10:31,205
Listen, Lempert needs
a few extra bucks.

202
00:10:31,264 --> 00:10:33,676
You think
maybe Furini was his banker?

203
00:10:34,601 --> 00:10:36,239
Yeah, at 50% interest.

204
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:38,371
Let's go see how Lempert lived.

205
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:41,950
Well, he certainly wasn't
stealing from the mob.

206
00:10:42,008 --> 00:10:44,545
He's got 230 bucks
in his checking account.

207
00:10:44,944 --> 00:10:48,551
Yeah, you work for the city for 20 years.
Makes you think.

208
00:10:51,518 --> 00:10:55,762
Whoa, three gray suits.
A wild and crazy guy.

209
00:10:56,422 --> 00:11:00,063
LOGAN: I don't think he spent money
on personal grooming, either.

210
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:01,500
Look at this.

211
00:11:01,795 --> 00:11:05,402
He must have 20 bottles of shampoo
from the Arcady Hotel downtown.

212
00:11:05,732 --> 00:11:08,144
So? I got a bathrobe
from Grossinger's.

213
00:11:08,201 --> 00:11:10,647
A guy who steals shampoo?

214
00:11:10,703 --> 00:11:14,014
He's gonna spend money on a hotel
that's a subway ride away?

215
00:11:17,544 --> 00:11:18,852
(PHONE RINGING)

216
00:11:18,912 --> 00:11:21,722
Sure, I remember him. Stayed with us a
little over three months last summer.

217
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:25,991
Yeah? Well, no offense, but this doesn't
exactly look like a vacation spot.

218
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:27,588
No offense taken.

219
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:32,066
And he wasn't on a vacation, Detective.
He was a guest of the state. Jury duty.

220
00:11:32,292 --> 00:11:33,794
This is where
they sequestered him?

221
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:36,431
Twelve people. Three
months, three meals a day.

222
00:11:36,496 --> 00:11:39,238
Great for business, and the
press didn't hurt, either.

223
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:41,677
Press, huh? Must've been
some big shot on trial.

224
00:11:41,734 --> 00:11:44,874
They don't get much bigger.
Vincent Dosso, the godfather.

225
00:11:44,938 --> 00:11:47,418
They tried him for knocking
off that labor guy, O'Malley.

226
00:11:49,843 --> 00:11:51,254
Small world.

227
00:11:55,682 --> 00:11:57,491
Lempert sits on Dosso's trial.

228
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:00,929
One of Dosso's henchmen is at the scene.
That's not just a coincidence.

229
00:12:00,987 --> 00:12:05,561
The jury hung, Mike. There was no retrial.
Why would they wanna kill him?

230
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:07,605
I'm thinking
Lempert hung the jury.

231
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:10,436
The guy worked
at a city computer all day.

232
00:12:10,496 --> 00:12:12,703
He's not the usual
target for a mob hit.

233
00:12:12,765 --> 00:12:15,644
I still haven't heard a reason
for making him dead.

234
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:18,178
Lempert was bought off.
Maybe he wanted more.

235
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:20,980
Or maybe his existence
gave Dosso agita.

236
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,917
I say we talk to those
other jurors.

237
00:12:22,976 --> 00:12:26,651
What are you gonna do, look up
"anonymous juror" in the yellow pages?

238
00:12:26,713 --> 00:12:29,250
They weren't anonymous
to everybody.

239
00:12:32,552 --> 00:12:35,533
Are you nuts? They'd can
me before breakfast.

240
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:39,792
The trial's been over for six months.
Who's it gonna hurt?

241
00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:41,566
Judge Berman's got rules.

242
00:12:41,628 --> 00:12:43,039
Hey, so does my Lieutenant.

243
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:45,474
That doesn't stop me from
taking a three-hour lunch break

244
00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:47,442
every now and then.

245
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:49,908
(SIGHING) Come on, Gibbons.

246
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:53,212
We're all working stiffs. We're
all on the same side here.

247
00:12:54,173 --> 00:12:56,653
I'll deny everything.
So will we.

248
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:00,949
One name, okay?

249
00:13:02,048 --> 00:13:04,858
No TV, radio,
newspapers or magazines.

250
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:07,158
Wow, three months is a long time.
It must have been hell.

251
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,221
Tell me about it.

252
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:10,824
No phone calls unless a court
officer stood next to me.

253
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:12,836
We couldn't even leave
our rooms for ice.

254
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:15,873
Convicted felons
get more privileges.

255
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:18,135
Do you remember a Dave Lempert?

256
00:13:18,698 --> 00:13:19,733
Remember him?

257
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,870
We would have been out of there
in a week if it wasn't for him.

258
00:13:21,935 --> 00:13:23,414
Are you saying
he was the only holdout?

259
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:26,712
Eleven people tell me the sky is
blue, I start to believe them.

260
00:13:26,773 --> 00:13:27,979
I tell you what.

261
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:30,749
"Reasonable doubt" are two words
I never wanna hear again.

262
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:34,087
You ever get the feeling his mind had
already been made up in advance?

263
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:36,286
If you're asking was he
bought off, I don't see how.

264
00:13:36,349 --> 00:13:38,625
Court officers were
all over us like flies on...

265
00:13:39,185 --> 00:13:41,392
I get your point.
My opinion?

266
00:13:41,721 --> 00:13:43,894
Lempert was just
a pain in the ass.

267
00:13:44,924 --> 00:13:47,302
Any time you get a defendant
up on a murder charge,

268
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:51,035
juror safety and/or potential
tampering become a major concern.

269
00:13:51,097 --> 00:13:54,271
Well, was the danger more than
hypothetical in Dosso's case?

270
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:56,780
Well, we assumed this guy
was capable of anything,

271
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:59,976
so we cranked up
security to the max.

272
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:02,512
Had the guys on OT, the works.

273
00:14:02,575 --> 00:14:06,022
We even brought in the FBI's
food taster on a consult.

274
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:08,452
Maybe your ship wasn't as
airtight as you thought.

275
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:12,052
I've been doing this 12 years, Detective.
I haven't lost a juror yet.

276
00:14:12,118 --> 00:14:13,392
That you know about.

277
00:14:13,453 --> 00:14:16,923
Let me ask you this. Did
anybody contact David Lempert?

278
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:22,305
Let's see. No visitors, no medical
requests, no special foods.

279
00:14:22,562 --> 00:14:23,905
LOGAN: What about phone calls?

280
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:27,501
Every outgoing phone call
is monitored by one of my men.

281
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:32,039
Looks like he dialed a daughter
in Pennsylvania once a week.

282
00:14:32,105 --> 00:14:33,607
BRISCOE:
What about incoming calls?

283
00:14:33,673 --> 00:14:36,779
Lempert had three.
All from his wife, Priscilla.

284
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:38,750
Be back.

285
00:14:40,413 --> 00:14:43,917
Now, didn't she say she hadn't
spoken to him in over a year?

286
00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:46,088
Maybe she got
her dates mixed up.

287
00:14:47,854 --> 00:14:50,994
You remember the last time
you spoke to your ex, Lennie?

288
00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:56,572
July 17th, 1994, 2:35 p.m.

289
00:14:58,264 --> 00:15:01,006
I gotta be honest with you,
Mrs. Lempert.

290
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:03,946
Nothing bothers me
more than being lied to.

291
00:15:04,003 --> 00:15:07,041
I didn't lie.
I never called David.

292
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:10,383
Oh, so, now it's the court
officer's logbook that lied?

293
00:15:10,443 --> 00:15:12,013
Three separate times?

294
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:15,059
If you're not honest with us,
Mrs. Lempert, we can't help you.

295
00:15:15,114 --> 00:15:17,993
Please, Detective, I'm not naive.
You're not here to help me.

296
00:15:18,051 --> 00:15:20,964
But we can arrest you
for obstructing justice.

297
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,191
Go ahead.

298
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:24,424
Think about it, Mrs. Lempert.

299
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:26,128
Every time you go out
to buy groceries,

300
00:15:26,192 --> 00:15:28,263
every time you go down
to the corner to get a paper,

301
00:15:28,327 --> 00:15:29,704
how safe are you gonna feel?

302
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:33,209
And you're going to protect me?
LOGAN: They killed your ex.

303
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,541
They know you know it.

304
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:37,603
Do you really think they're going
to send you a sympathy card

305
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,172
and forget about it?

306
00:15:39,739 --> 00:15:43,152
And then they're gonna come after
anybody you might have told.

307
00:15:43,576 --> 00:15:44,850
Like your daughter.

308
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:54,957
After the divorce,

309
00:15:56,222 --> 00:15:57,701
money grew tight.

310
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:02,535
David was having trouble making
Emily's college payments.

311
00:16:02,595 --> 00:16:06,168
We were talking about transferring
her from Swarthmore to SUNY.

312
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:09,336
And that was a big deal?
To David it was.

313
00:16:09,502 --> 00:16:12,483
And then somebody came along
to solve all your problems.

314
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:17,849
He never told me his name.

315
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:20,419
I never asked.

316
00:16:23,015 --> 00:16:27,225
He showed up here one night
when David was at the jury.

317
00:16:29,422 --> 00:16:31,424
He knew everything about us.

318
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:33,937
And you didn't get
just a little bit suspicious?

319
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,404
I was scared.

320
00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:39,542
All I had to do
was call David at the hotel

321
00:16:39,599 --> 00:16:42,603
and then leave the apartment
while they spoke.

322
00:16:46,906 --> 00:16:50,683
After the trial, David
paid Swarthmore in full.

323
00:16:54,113 --> 00:16:56,184
I never asked where he got it.

324
00:16:58,818 --> 00:17:00,798
Is that the mystery man?

325
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:08,500
All we've got is Jury Tampering
in the Second Degree.

326
00:17:08,561 --> 00:17:09,665
A misdemeanor.

327
00:17:09,729 --> 00:17:13,199
You'd think bribing a juror would carry a
little bit more than a slap on the wrist.

328
00:17:13,266 --> 00:17:17,715
Well, you're assuming somebody up in
Albany actually thinks for a living.

329
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:21,708
Poor sap. He gets himself killed for
just trying to keep his kid in school.

330
00:17:21,774 --> 00:17:24,755
He took money to throw a case.
He's no saint, Lennie.

331
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:28,189
Hey, he was being squeezed from all sides.
He thought he'd found a way out.

332
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:29,817
Well, maybe as part
of his sentence,

333
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:32,260
Furini will finish paying
the girl's tuition.

334
00:17:32,318 --> 00:17:34,320
Pick him up.
What, on a misdemeanor?

335
00:17:36,322 --> 00:17:38,893
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't
know you were too busy.

336
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:41,302
Look,
Furini's not going anywhere.

337
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:45,103
We take Lempert's wife's statement
to a judge, we could get a wiretap.

338
00:17:45,164 --> 00:17:47,770
Maybe we could get him
on the murder.

339
00:17:48,201 --> 00:17:50,579
Shortest distance
between two points?

340
00:17:52,438 --> 00:17:54,042
Talk to OCCB.

341
00:17:54,106 --> 00:17:57,679
They've been bugging Dosso's social
club ever since the mistrial.

342
00:17:59,111 --> 00:18:01,284
MAN 1: You got the shirt?
MAN 2: Yeah, I got the shirt.

343
00:18:01,347 --> 00:18:04,260
You sure you got the shirt?
Yeah, I got the shirt.

344
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:06,489
You got the bullets
for the shirt?

345
00:18:07,186 --> 00:18:08,927
Not exactly brain surgeons.

346
00:18:08,988 --> 00:18:10,865
Well, they're smart enough
to know you're eavesdropping.

347
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,596
You got anything with Furini?

348
00:18:12,658 --> 00:18:14,865
Yeah, I taped this yesterday.

349
00:18:17,997 --> 00:18:20,341
LOGAN: Yes, the Dandy Don.

350
00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:22,003
Shows up every morning
at 8:00.

351
00:18:22,068 --> 00:18:24,480
He and Furini have been
very tight since the trial.

352
00:18:24,537 --> 00:18:27,780
You got any conversations between
them about a guy named Lempert?

353
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,753
We've got bugs
and phone taps on Dosso,

354
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:33,518
Furini and everybody else
they eat pasta with.

355
00:18:33,713 --> 00:18:35,784
These are the ones
we transcribed already.

356
00:18:35,848 --> 00:18:39,261
They're labeled by who was in
the room or who made the call.

357
00:18:40,086 --> 00:18:42,930
And these are tapes
we haven't even gotten to yet.

358
00:18:43,089 --> 00:18:46,195
Well, my boss will give you
a 49 for the dupes, okay?

359
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:50,831
DOSSO: Furini's a moron. We've
been picking his pocket since '85,

360
00:18:50,897 --> 00:18:53,138
and the son of a bitch is dumb
enough to thank us for it.

361
00:18:54,367 --> 00:18:55,812
Sounds like my family.

362
00:18:55,868 --> 00:18:59,509
We're wasting our time. These
guys know OCCB's listening in.

363
00:18:59,572 --> 00:19:01,449
They're not gonna
say anything useful.

364
00:19:01,507 --> 00:19:03,612
Well, if the bad guys didn't
screw up every once in a while,

365
00:19:03,676 --> 00:19:04,814
the jails would be empty.

366
00:19:04,877 --> 00:19:07,915
Listen to this, from a phone
call between Dosso and Furini

367
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,153
the day after Lempert
was popped.

368
00:19:10,216 --> 00:19:13,789
Furini, "Mr. Parks
is all taken care of, Vin."

369
00:19:13,853 --> 00:19:15,992
"Bada-bing,
bada-bang, bada-boom."

370
00:19:16,055 --> 00:19:18,831
Dosso, "Good job, John."

371
00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:21,701
Mr. Parks? Well, Lempert worked
for the Parks Department.

372
00:19:21,761 --> 00:19:23,365
It's gotta be, right?

373
00:19:23,429 --> 00:19:25,534
Find the tape.
Pick them both up.

374
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,511
We're here to see
Vincent Dosso.

375
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:32,378
Mr. Dosso isn't taking
any visitors tonight.

376
00:19:32,438 --> 00:19:34,941
He'll make an exception for us.

377
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:38,750
Vincent Dosso, John Furini,

378
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:41,992
you're under arrest for the
murder of David Lempert.

379
00:19:42,048 --> 00:19:43,493
You have the right
to remain silent.

380
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:46,792
Anything you do say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

381
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:48,490
You have the right
to an attorney.

382
00:19:48,554 --> 00:19:51,626
If you cannot afford one,
one will be provided for you.

383
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:52,795
You have the right
to make one...

384
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:58,600
You know, Jack, we would have been
more comfortable in my office.

385
00:19:59,065 --> 00:20:02,012
We would have been
more comfortable in Aruba.

386
00:20:02,468 --> 00:20:05,415
But I'm sure neither one of us
could afford the time.

387
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:08,648
Looks more like you couldn't
afford the airfare.

388
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:11,450
I work for the government, Paul.
No one would have ever known.

389
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:14,582
See? That's why he graduated
number eight in the class.

390
00:20:15,281 --> 00:20:18,285
But like they say, the A students
end up working for the C students.

391
00:20:18,351 --> 00:20:20,763
Or in this case,
being humiliated by them.

392
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:23,926
We have your client
and Mr. Furini on tape.

393
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:26,834
Let me guess.
It's another A student?

394
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:30,840
Yeah, but you don't have to be
Law Review to add one and one.

395
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:32,876
FURINI: Mr. Parks
is all taken care of, Vin.

396
00:20:32,932 --> 00:20:35,003
Bada-bing,
bada-bang, bada-boom.

397
00:20:35,601 --> 00:20:36,909
DOSSO: Good job, John.

398
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:40,615
I think the meaning is obvious.

399
00:20:40,673 --> 00:20:43,654
Sure, it is. They were
watching Miss America reruns.

400
00:20:46,012 --> 00:20:48,458
Not to be condescending,
Jack, but you gotta know

401
00:20:48,514 --> 00:20:50,858
your case is gonna go
the way of all flesh.

402
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:54,295
Why, because you're the lead
counsel for the defense?

403
00:20:54,487 --> 00:20:57,559
Because that tape will never
be heard in the courtroom.

404
00:20:58,257 --> 00:20:59,463
Motion to suppress.

405
00:20:59,525 --> 00:21:03,530
I believe Mr. Murphy has a similar
motion on Mr. Furini's behalf.

406
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:06,205
See you in chambers.

407
00:21:10,503 --> 00:21:14,041
Oh, I almost forgot.
Anna sends her love.

408
00:21:18,778 --> 00:21:20,485
You're friends with him?

409
00:21:21,414 --> 00:21:25,260
Great point guard. We beat the
med school three years running.

410
00:21:26,485 --> 00:21:27,793
Did he pay off the ref?

411
00:21:29,321 --> 00:21:32,632
He's the defense counsel,
Claire, not the defendant.

412
00:21:36,529 --> 00:21:38,941
I just wanna make sure we're
all on the same page here.

413
00:21:38,998 --> 00:21:40,636
This is America, right?

414
00:21:42,201 --> 00:21:46,877
We do still have a constitution and
at least four amendments thereto?

415
00:21:47,506 --> 00:21:51,386
The conversation in question was obtained
by OCCB through a valid warrant.

416
00:21:51,444 --> 00:21:52,980
Yes, but valid against whom?

417
00:21:53,045 --> 00:21:57,551
The warrant Mr. McCoy refers to was
for a tap on Mr. Furini's telephone.

418
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:01,630
Its specific intent was to
implicate Mr. Furini in a crime.

419
00:22:01,754 --> 00:22:04,428
And if I'm not mistaken,
that's exactly what it's done.

420
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:06,731
Mr. Murphy will address
that shortly, Your Honor.

421
00:22:06,792 --> 00:22:09,295
At the moment,
my concern is with Mr. Dosso.

422
00:22:09,361 --> 00:22:10,931
Takes two to have
a telephone conversation.

423
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:13,374
And if you intend
to offer that conversation

424
00:22:13,432 --> 00:22:15,275
as evidence against the party
of the second part,

425
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:17,211
his name should have been
included in the warrant.

426
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:18,543
That's absurd.

427
00:22:19,138 --> 00:22:21,584
Let's pretend I have a warrant to
search your apartment for drugs.

428
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:24,143
I legally enter, only to
discover that Pablo Escobar

429
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:26,087
is about to sell you
a pound of cocaine.

430
00:22:26,145 --> 00:22:28,250
You're saying I can't arrest him?
Of course not.

431
00:22:28,314 --> 00:22:33,024
Because Mr. Escobar didn't have an
expectation of privacy in my apartment.

432
00:22:33,285 --> 00:22:35,356
Exactly, and Mr. Dosso
didn't have an expectation

433
00:22:35,421 --> 00:22:37,298
of anything
in Mr. Furini's telephone.

434
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:40,667
But he did in the telephone
used to call Mr. Furini.

435
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:45,708
The OCCB had a separate warrant
for Mr. Dosso's telephone.

436
00:22:45,765 --> 00:22:47,073
KOPELL: His office phone.

437
00:22:47,133 --> 00:22:51,411
My client placed the call in question
from a pay phone in Miami Beach.

438
00:22:52,238 --> 00:22:55,344
He certainly had expectation
of privacy therein.

439
00:22:57,510 --> 00:23:00,616
Your Honor, to admit this
evidence against my client

440
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:04,855
would sound the death knell for any
and all Fourth Amendment protection.

441
00:23:04,917 --> 00:23:06,191
(LAUGHS)

442
00:23:06,252 --> 00:23:08,232
That's very eloquent,
Mr. Kopell.

443
00:23:08,287 --> 00:23:11,166
You can't possibly...
I wear the robes, Mr. McCoy.

444
00:23:11,357 --> 00:23:13,064
I can do anything I like.

445
00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:16,299
I like to keep the state out of
our bedrooms and our churches

446
00:23:16,362 --> 00:23:18,000
and our telephones.

447
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:20,839
Your Honor, the warrant in this
case was issued specifically

448
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:24,643
to gather evidence relating to the
murder of a Mr. John O'Malley.

449
00:23:24,703 --> 00:23:26,148
It's a totally unrelated crime.

450
00:23:26,205 --> 00:23:29,618
The conversation at issue is far
beyond the scope of this warrant.

451
00:23:29,675 --> 00:23:31,450
JACK: This is plain view,
Your Honor.

452
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:32,511
Harris v. U. S.

453
00:23:32,578 --> 00:23:35,787
But, Judge... Mr. Murphy,
I may be open-minded,

454
00:23:36,215 --> 00:23:37,694
but I'm not vacant.

455
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:40,994
Now, the tape is admissible
against Mr. Furini,

456
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,296
and it's inadmissible
against Mr. Dosso.

457
00:23:49,628 --> 00:23:51,767
Still flinching when you get
near the boards, huh, Jack?

458
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:53,400
I've still got my outside shot.

459
00:23:53,465 --> 00:23:58,107
How many times do I have to tell you,
you cannot win without an inside game.

460
00:23:58,737 --> 00:24:02,844
I'll send my messenger
for the notice of dismissal.

461
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:06,821
Expectation of privacy.

462
00:24:07,546 --> 00:24:09,890
He earned his $600 an hour.

463
00:24:09,949 --> 00:24:12,862
He made a good argument
in front of the right judge.

464
00:24:12,985 --> 00:24:15,659
This certainly isn't the work
of a C student.

465
00:24:15,721 --> 00:24:16,756
Paul only got C's

466
00:24:16,822 --> 00:24:20,201
because he spent more time around
a courtroom than a classroom.

467
00:24:20,259 --> 00:24:21,670
Poverty Law Group,

468
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:24,831
Abused Women
Advocacy Coalition.

469
00:24:25,864 --> 00:24:27,400
He's come a long way.

470
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:30,140
It's about the battle,
Claire, not the prize.

471
00:24:30,202 --> 00:24:34,617
He blindsided a half-witted judge on
behalf of the head of a mob family.

472
00:24:34,873 --> 00:24:36,750
You're acting like it was
some kind of noble cause.

473
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:38,413
It's part of the game.

474
00:24:38,577 --> 00:24:40,784
Excuse me? Last I looked,
it was about justice.

475
00:24:40,846 --> 00:24:42,655
That's merely a by-product.

476
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:44,354
Boy Scouts seek it,

477
00:24:44,416 --> 00:24:47,420
effective prosecutors do their
best to avoid thinking about it.

478
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:50,490
And what do they think about?
Winning, period.

479
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:55,032
I'm sorry, I don't put in 15 hours a
day just so I can flex my muscles.

480
00:24:55,094 --> 00:24:56,164
Well, you better start, Claire,

481
00:24:56,228 --> 00:24:59,505
or you'll wind up talking
to yourself in elevators.

482
00:25:00,533 --> 00:25:03,309
Now, Adam, we've got
the wiretap on Furini,

483
00:25:03,369 --> 00:25:06,782
his fingerprints at the garage,
and an ID by Lempert's wife.

484
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:11,781
If we're lucky, he won't want to spend
the rest of his life in prison.

485
00:25:11,844 --> 00:25:15,189
He gives us Dosso.
Man one with a recommendation.

486
00:25:17,883 --> 00:25:19,487
(GATE BUZZING)

487
00:25:19,551 --> 00:25:21,292
FURINI:
You're wasting your time.

488
00:25:21,587 --> 00:25:24,158
JACK: You're not being loyal.
You're being stupid.

489
00:25:25,624 --> 00:25:26,796
Look around.

490
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,706
This is as good
as it's gonna get.

491
00:25:29,762 --> 00:25:32,743
Do you actually think Dosso
would return the loyalty?

492
00:25:33,032 --> 00:25:35,012
JACK: Think about it,
Mr. Furini.

493
00:25:35,067 --> 00:25:37,673
Dosso had one of the best
lawyers in the city,

494
00:25:37,736 --> 00:25:39,841
and you had
Oliver Wendell Blockhead here.

495
00:25:39,905 --> 00:25:40,906
Hey.

496
00:25:40,973 --> 00:25:43,476
Dosso and Kopell
gave us a bone,

497
00:25:44,843 --> 00:25:46,151
and it's you, sir.

498
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:48,623
MURPHY: That's enough.
We're done talking.

499
00:25:49,648 --> 00:25:52,128
Fine, no more talking.
Let's just listen.

500
00:25:55,621 --> 00:25:59,068
DOSSO: Furini's a moron. We've
been picking his pocket since '85,

501
00:25:59,124 --> 00:26:02,298
and the son of a bitch is dumb
enough to thank us for it.

502
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:05,306
I ain't gonna testify
against Vin.

503
00:26:05,364 --> 00:26:08,004
Maybe you could help us
without taking the stand.

504
00:26:08,067 --> 00:26:10,377
I wouldn't advise that, John.
You.

505
00:26:12,004 --> 00:26:14,245
What have you got?
It depends what you give.

506
00:26:14,306 --> 00:26:17,412
John, if anybody finds out...
We're both dead.

507
00:26:20,179 --> 00:26:23,490
Above the club, there's an apartment.
2G, I think.

508
00:26:23,716 --> 00:26:27,664
Some old bag lives there.
Dosso uses it when she's out.

509
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:30,494
That should be enough for an
electronic surveillance warrant.

510
00:26:30,556 --> 00:26:33,662
John's name
doesn't appear anywhere.

511
00:26:33,726 --> 00:26:35,467
Congratulations, Mr. Furini.

512
00:26:35,527 --> 00:26:38,007
You've just become
an anonymous informant.

513
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,201
What'd I miss?

514
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:45,077
A couple of bottles of Chianti
and the old lady's itinerary.

515
00:26:45,137 --> 00:26:47,014
And another fabulous lunch,
I see.

516
00:26:47,072 --> 00:26:50,110
Oh, we still have some fried rice left.
Thanks, anyway.

517
00:26:50,175 --> 00:26:52,621
Hey, Logan,
you might want to hear this.

518
00:26:53,879 --> 00:26:56,359
DOSSO: Hey, what can I tell you?
Pauly's the best.

519
00:26:56,415 --> 00:26:59,055
You want a dismissal,
get yourself a Jew.

00:26:59,318 --> 00:27:02,390
MAN: What about Lempert's wife?
She knows what I did to hubby.

521
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:06,630
He stays dead, she's no problem.
Send her some flowers or something.

Hey, Vinny, you got that thing at 5:00.
Your car's downstairs.

525
00:27:15,901 --> 00:27:17,278
Sounds good to me.

526
00:27:17,336 --> 00:27:19,543

as soon as he hits the street.

00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:30,020
Sorry to ruin your plans.

Oh, don't you guys
ever get tired?

530

Of that face? Never.

531
00:27:33,719 --> 00:27:35,995
Vincent Dosso, you're under arrest
for the murder of David Lempert.

532
00:27:36,054 --> 00:27:37,089
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

533
00:27:37,156 --> 00:27:38,726
You have the right
to remain silent.

534
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:40,394
Anything you say
can and will be used...

"People v. Vincent Dosso."

"Charge is Murder
in the Second Degree."

538
00:27:49,902 --> 00:27:51,245
How do you plead?

539
00:27:51,303 --> 00:27:53,510
Not guilty, Your Honor.
JUDGE WELCH: Miss Kincaid?

540
00:27:53,572 --> 00:27:54,846
Because of the nature
of the charges

541
00:27:54,907 --> 00:27:58,184
and Mr. Dosso's connection to organized...
KOPELL: Plumbing.

542
00:27:58,477 --> 00:28:00,457
Mr. Dosso is a small
businessman, Your Honor.

543
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:04,517
And I had a leaky faucet that I'm
still paying off two years later.

544
00:28:05,617 --> 00:28:07,756
Bail is set at $500,000.

545
00:28:15,561 --> 00:28:18,405
Second bite at a bad apple's
just as sour.

546
00:28:19,198 --> 00:28:21,542
There are no constitutional
violations this time.

547
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,738
Maybe not,

548
00:28:23,135 --> 00:28:26,605
but I'm sure you've heard
of attorney-client privilege.

549
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:28,207
See you in chambers.

550

MAN: We sent her
for a week to Atlantic City.

551

DOSSO: You make sure she's flush. KOPELL:
All taken care of, Vin. I did it myself.

552
00:28:36,448 --> 00:28:38,223
That last voice, it's mine.

553
00:28:38,417 --> 00:28:40,055
Because you say it is?

554
00:28:40,152 --> 00:28:43,326
No, because Dr. Peter Frank
of M.l.T. says it is,

555
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:47,859
as he swears to in this affidavit, signed
following electronic voice analysis.

556
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,499
And as Mr. Dosso
is my longstanding client,

557
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:54,009
this entire conversation is privileged,
and therefore inadmissible.

558
00:28:54,066 --> 00:28:56,478
The first voice
on that tape wasn't yours.

559
00:28:56,535 --> 00:28:59,573
Privilege is broken
when a third party is present.

560
00:28:59,638 --> 00:29:02,118
Unless the third party
is also a client.

561
00:29:02,174 --> 00:29:05,644
The voice Ms. Kincaid refers
to is that of Al Gennaro,

562
00:29:05,711 --> 00:29:09,022
who I have successfully represented
several times over the years.

563
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:12,688
The discussion of a criminal enterprise
is not privileged, Your Honor.

564
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:16,255
That's correct, if it's an
on-going or future enterprise.

565
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:20,229
Unfortunately, it appears the
defendant was discussing past crimes.

566
00:29:20,893 --> 00:29:23,533
I'm going to have to
exclude the tape.

567
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:25,840
Make a motion, Mr. Kopell.

568
00:29:25,897 --> 00:29:28,639
As there is no other evidence
against my client?

569
00:29:29,101 --> 00:29:30,102
No?

570
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:32,346
I move for a dismissal.

571
00:29:32,404 --> 00:29:33,940
I object, Your Honor.

572
00:29:34,673 --> 00:29:37,313
So do I, but I have no choice.

573
00:29:38,677 --> 00:29:42,147
Your friend plays the game
by a different set of rules.

574
00:29:42,848 --> 00:29:46,318
He and I are not playing the
same game anymore, Claire.

575
00:29:46,385 --> 00:29:50,026
Wait a minute, is that the sound
of an ego being deflated?

576
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:54,331
First day of law school.

577
00:29:55,894 --> 00:29:59,103
"What's the cornerstone
of the adversarial process?"

578
00:29:59,398 --> 00:30:01,571
I don't need
the Socratic attitude.

579
00:30:02,401 --> 00:30:04,813
Just answer the question,
Claire.

580
00:30:05,237 --> 00:30:08,616
Two independent counsel, arguing
points of fact and points of law

581
00:30:08,674 --> 00:30:10,711
before an impartial judge and jury.
Right.

582
00:30:10,776 --> 00:30:13,154
The operative word being
"independent."

583
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:16,859
Paul crossed the line.

584
00:30:16,915 --> 00:30:18,519
He listened to Dosso brag
about his exploits.

585
00:30:18,584 --> 00:30:20,530
He didn't do anything illegal.

586
00:30:20,986 --> 00:30:22,465
You heard the tape.

587
00:30:23,021 --> 00:30:26,662
Paul paid the old lady to leave town
so they could use her apartment.

588
00:30:26,725 --> 00:30:28,466
So what?
There's no crime there, Jack.

589
00:30:28,527 --> 00:30:31,440
He facilitated the operation
of a criminal enterprise.

590
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:34,807
Well, he does that every time
he steps into court for Dosso.

591
00:30:35,701 --> 00:30:38,113
Referring to Lempert,
Dosso says,

592
00:30:39,404 --> 00:30:41,645
"And somebody cancel the
subscription to Sporting News."

593
00:30:41,707 --> 00:30:44,779
How do you suppose Dosso knew
Lempert's reading habits?

594
00:30:44,943 --> 00:30:46,718
Maybe they had
cappuccino together.

595
00:30:46,778 --> 00:30:48,883
A bribed juror? No way.

596
00:30:48,947 --> 00:30:51,689
Dosso wouldn't have gotten
within a mile of him.

597
00:30:55,087 --> 00:30:57,931
There were 12 people
on that jury, Claire.

598
00:30:58,256 --> 00:31:02,261
If Dosso had picked one who happened
to have a sudden bout of honesty,

599
00:31:02,327 --> 00:31:05,774
there would have been another
count on the indictment.

600
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:11,605
No, I suspect Dosso knew
exactly what he was doing

601
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:13,813
when he approached Lempert.

602
00:31:15,674 --> 00:31:19,349
Lempert was desperate for the money.
He lived alone.

603
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:23,081
The juror questionnaires.

604
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:26,954
How much money do you make?
How much do you owe?

605
00:31:27,019 --> 00:31:29,124
How many dependents
do you have?

606
00:31:30,222 --> 00:31:32,395
What's your biggest
single expense?

607
00:31:36,294 --> 00:31:37,329
Kopell framed questions

608
00:31:37,396 --> 00:31:41,242
that would make it easier to pick the
juror most likely to take a bribe.

609
00:31:41,299 --> 00:31:44,837
Even if you're right, the
questionnaires were anonymous.

610
00:31:46,872 --> 00:31:49,546
Not to the county clerks,
they weren't.

611
00:31:50,242 --> 00:31:52,722
I worked for Judge Berman
for eight years.

612
00:31:52,778 --> 00:31:55,190
Nobody ever accused me
of any wrongdoing.

613
00:31:55,247 --> 00:31:58,319
JACK: Well, we're accusing you, Mark.
Yeah? Well, I didn't do nothing.

614
00:31:58,383 --> 00:32:02,058
You worked for the State. You took money.
That's receiving a bribe.

615
00:32:03,155 --> 00:32:05,066
All those years in a courtroom,

616
00:32:05,123 --> 00:32:08,195
you have to know
it's better to talk to us now.

617
00:32:09,227 --> 00:32:12,834
We're on the same side, right?
Why are you doing this to me?

618
00:32:12,898 --> 00:32:14,434
You wanna know why?

619
00:32:14,633 --> 00:32:16,613
Because I bust my butt
to bring down scum like Dosso,

620
00:32:16,668 --> 00:32:20,013
then some whore in a uniform
sandbags me for a couple of bucks.

621
00:32:20,072 --> 00:32:23,110
If you took over $10,000,
it's a C felony.

622
00:32:24,242 --> 00:32:26,449
That's three years in Attica.

623
00:32:28,814 --> 00:32:30,725
He only gave me $5,000.

624
00:32:32,284 --> 00:32:33,558
Who did, Mark?

625
00:32:37,756 --> 00:32:40,293
Some gumba.
Said he worked for Dosso.

626
00:32:41,893 --> 00:32:42,997
Twenty-five years ago,

627
00:32:43,061 --> 00:32:45,871
Paul stayed up till 3:00
the night before an exam

628
00:32:45,931 --> 00:32:48,434
to teach me the Rule
Against Perpetuities.

629
00:32:48,934 --> 00:32:51,141
Smart has nothing
to do with honest.

630
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:53,680
What are you gonna do?

631
00:32:54,573 --> 00:32:56,780
How does burning
at the stake sound?

632
00:32:57,309 --> 00:33:01,416
Well, even if we could implicate Kopell,
it's only Bribery Three, an E felony.

633
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:04,552
No. It's an A felony.

634
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:08,924
Paul picked David Lempert's
name out of the pile.

635
00:33:09,421 --> 00:33:12,800
It's the first step in the
conspiracy to commit murder.

636
00:33:12,858 --> 00:33:15,702
You don't think Kopell actually knew
they were going to kill Lempert.

637
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,741
We wanna get Dosso, right?
Paul can give him to us.

638
00:33:21,933 --> 00:33:24,379
Mrs. Kopell?
Yes?

639
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:26,148
Is your husband in?

640
00:33:27,239 --> 00:33:30,152
We have people here.
This will only take a minute.

641
00:33:41,153 --> 00:33:42,791
Can't this wait?
No, it can't.

642
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:46,324
Paul Kopell, you're under arrest for
conspiracy to murder David Lempert.

643
00:33:46,391 --> 00:33:48,632
Drink up. You have the
right to remain silent.

644
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:51,572
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

645
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:52,802
Do you understand that?

646
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:53,968
You have the right
to an attorney.

647
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:58,276
If you cannot afford one, one will
be provided to you free of charge.

648
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:05,349
You son of a bitch.
Now, now, calm down.

649
00:34:05,977 --> 00:34:08,719
You could have called, Jack.
You have my number.

650
00:34:09,247 --> 00:34:11,420
I'm sorry.
It fell out of my Rolodex.

651
00:34:11,483 --> 00:34:13,929
The police, Jack?
In our home, terrorizing us?

652
00:34:13,985 --> 00:34:16,966
Yes. I wanted him to be scared.
He should be scared.

653
00:34:17,022 --> 00:34:18,592
Well, it isn't working.

654
00:34:18,657 --> 00:34:21,194
Although you did get to the women and
children, if that makes you happy.

655
00:34:21,259 --> 00:34:23,102
Happy? That's right,
I'm thrilled to discover

656
00:34:23,161 --> 00:34:24,697
that my friend of 25 years
is a felon.

657
00:34:24,763 --> 00:34:26,538
Oh, give me a break!

658
00:34:26,965 --> 00:34:29,377
Let's assume
Dosso bribed the clerk.

659
00:34:29,434 --> 00:34:32,574
What does that have to do with me?
No, you give me a break, Paul.

660
00:34:32,637 --> 00:34:34,173
We both know
you're smarter than that.

661
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:37,118
This is really getting your
juices going, isn't it, Jack?

662
00:34:37,175 --> 00:34:39,212
Anna, if you can't let me proceed
here, you better step outside.

663
00:34:39,277 --> 00:34:41,780
You know us.
You know our children.

664
00:34:42,948 --> 00:34:45,485
You can put an end
to this right now, Paul.

665
00:34:46,851 --> 00:34:47,921
Give me Dosso.

666
00:34:47,986 --> 00:34:49,966
And get killed?
Anna, stop it!

667
00:34:51,656 --> 00:34:55,069
Look, Jack, you can't
even carry my briefcase.

668
00:34:55,126 --> 00:34:57,128
You never could.
I'll tell you what.

669
00:34:57,195 --> 00:34:58,902
Tomorrow I'm gonna
get this crap dismissed,

670
00:34:58,964 --> 00:35:01,308
and the next day I'm gonna hit
you with a civil suit so big

671
00:35:01,366 --> 00:35:04,643
your great-grandchildren
will be answering motions.

672
00:35:13,845 --> 00:35:17,383
Even if this nonsense about
jury questionnaires is true,

673
00:35:17,883 --> 00:35:21,023
the state still cannot produce
any evidence whatsoever

674
00:35:21,086 --> 00:35:24,624
that implicates me
in any way to the murder.

675
00:35:25,257 --> 00:35:26,964
Basic conspiracy theory,
Your Honor.

676
00:35:27,025 --> 00:35:29,335
The left hand doesn't have to know
what the right hand is doing,

677
00:35:29,394 --> 00:35:32,273
so long as they share
a common criminal purpose.

678
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:36,904
The purpose in this case being to
rig the trial of Vincent Dosso

679
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:40,438
and destroy the evidence thereof,
I.e., murdering David Lempert.

680
00:35:40,505 --> 00:35:44,715
Only there is no proof that Mr. Dosso
is connected in any way to said murder.

681
00:35:44,776 --> 00:35:47,382
We have him
confessing to it on tape.

682
00:35:47,779 --> 00:35:50,487
A tape which Judge Gance
declared inadmissible

683
00:35:50,549 --> 00:35:52,187
because of
attorney-client privilege.

684
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:56,392
Your Honor, if you would read the order
labeled Exhibit Three to my brief?

685
00:35:56,488 --> 00:35:58,365
I read it, Mr. Kopell.

686
00:35:59,758 --> 00:36:02,762
Judge Gance's decision
seems clear, Mr. McCoy.

687
00:36:03,061 --> 00:36:06,235
Nobody's trying to violate
privilege, Your Honor.

688
00:36:06,464 --> 00:36:08,068
The state's position is

689
00:36:08,233 --> 00:36:13,478
that due to Mr. Kopell's total immersion
in Vincent Dosso's criminal activities,

690
00:36:13,538 --> 00:36:18,612
he stopped being an attorney and
became a de facto participant thereof.

691
00:36:18,677 --> 00:36:20,247
That is ridiculous.

692
00:36:20,312 --> 00:36:21,916
It's also very creative.

693
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:23,960
Mr. McCoy's
creativity notwithstanding,

694
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:26,894
it's well settled that the
privilege belongs to the client.

695
00:36:26,952 --> 00:36:30,456
Mr. Dosso believed he was conversing
in the presence of his attorney.

696
00:36:30,522 --> 00:36:34,060
That's all that matters. That's
correct as far as Mr. Dosso.

697
00:36:34,125 --> 00:36:36,799
The privilege is intended
to promote free dialogue

698
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:39,341
between the client
and his legal representative.

699
00:36:39,397 --> 00:36:40,432
It goes both ways.

700
00:36:40,498 --> 00:36:44,742
Not if you weren't functioning as a
legal representative, it doesn't.

701
00:36:45,637 --> 00:36:48,117
Same time,
same place next week,

702
00:36:48,173 --> 00:36:52,383
I'll listen to evidence relating
to Mr. Kopell's true relationship

703
00:36:52,444 --> 00:36:54,014
to Mr. Dosso's business.

704
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:55,316
(GAVEL BANGS)

705
00:36:57,949 --> 00:37:00,520
So, what do we do,
look at Kopell's time sheets?

706
00:37:00,585 --> 00:37:03,259
I doubt he listed, "Six
hours, criminal activities."

707
00:37:03,321 --> 00:37:06,268
I don't need your sarcasm
right now, Claire.

708
00:37:06,491 --> 00:37:07,526
(SIGHING)

709
00:37:07,592 --> 00:37:10,903
Look, Jack, this whole thing
is getting out of hand.

710
00:37:11,997 --> 00:37:14,978
Do you wanna put Dosso in prison?
Of course, I do.

711
00:37:15,033 --> 00:37:17,240
Well, I'm fresh out of ideas.

712
00:37:17,802 --> 00:37:20,305
This is the only way
I can see of doing it.

713
00:37:24,042 --> 00:37:26,579
Déjà vu, no?
We've been through this.

714
00:37:27,112 --> 00:37:29,649
No way I testify against Dosso.

715
00:37:30,682 --> 00:37:32,821
I'm not asking you to,
Mr. Furini.

716
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:36,455
I wanna know about his lawyer.
You're kidding, right?

717
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:39,197
Are you sure
you don't want a lawyer?

718
00:37:39,624 --> 00:37:40,625
Lawyers.

719
00:37:41,927 --> 00:37:43,702
You cut my sentence.

720
00:37:44,295 --> 00:37:47,037
Seven years.
Five.

721
00:37:47,966 --> 00:37:48,967
Fine.

722
00:37:49,834 --> 00:37:52,815
Like I said, you get
nothing from me on Dosso.

723
00:37:53,638 --> 00:37:55,049
And another thing,

724
00:37:55,140 --> 00:38:00,089
I get immunity for anything I might
say of a self-incriminating nature.

725
00:38:04,883 --> 00:38:06,260
FURINI:
Kopell was always there.

726
00:38:06,317 --> 00:38:08,627
He was in the room whenever
we talked about anything.

727
00:38:08,687 --> 00:38:11,327
JACK: What kind of thing
did you talk about?

728
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:13,595
Things. You know, business.

729
00:38:13,725 --> 00:38:15,534
What kind of business, sir?

730
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,671
Our deal stands, right?

731
00:38:21,499 --> 00:38:25,140
A lot of times I talked about
how I was gonna pop someone.

732
00:38:26,704 --> 00:38:29,184
Could you please
be more specific?

733
00:38:29,874 --> 00:38:32,354
Like that mick,
the labor guy, O'Malley.

734
00:38:36,481 --> 00:38:40,520
Mr. Kopell was in the room when you
decided to kill John O'Malley?

735
00:38:40,585 --> 00:38:43,930
That's right. And Lloyd
Lipman and Tomaso Bucci.

736
00:38:44,789 --> 00:38:49,602
Please limit your responses to the case
of the deceased juror, David Lempert.

737
00:38:50,662 --> 00:38:54,337
Yeah, I offed him, too. That's
why I'm presently in the can.

738
00:38:54,399 --> 00:39:00,475
And Mr. Kopell was in the room with you
when you decided to kill Mr. Lempert?

739
00:39:03,441 --> 00:39:05,421
He was eating a cannoli.

740
00:39:12,283 --> 00:39:14,285
Was anyone else in the room,
Mr. Furini?

741
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:17,492
Nice try, Counselor.
I don't recall.

742
00:39:17,589 --> 00:39:18,727
Your Honor, this is ridiculous.

743
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:20,201
The man cut a deal
with the state.

744
00:39:20,258 --> 00:39:23,330
He's obviously going to say
whatever they want to hear.

745
00:39:23,394 --> 00:39:26,568
And look at his track record. Can
you really rely on his credibility?

746
00:39:26,631 --> 00:39:30,545
It's your own credibility I'd
start worrying about, Mr. Kopell.

747
00:39:31,069 --> 00:39:33,310
The witness has established
to my satisfaction

748
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:36,648
that you functioned in something
more than a legal capacity.

749
00:39:37,575 --> 00:39:40,886
As such, the material in
question is not privileged.

750
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:45,354
My clerk will inform you
as to commencement of trial.

751
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:49,092
What is this,
Bernie's Bargain Basement?

752
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:53,930
Today's special, cop to four
murders, get only five years.

753
00:39:55,693 --> 00:39:59,402
When I gave Furini immunity,
I had no idea.

754
00:39:59,864 --> 00:40:03,812
No idea, because the blood was
rushing downstream from your head

755
00:40:04,202 --> 00:40:06,614
and is settling somewhere
south of the border.

756
00:40:06,671 --> 00:40:08,651
I'm trying to get Dosso, Adam.

757
00:40:08,706 --> 00:40:11,448
You're no closer than you
were three months ago.

758
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:13,312
Paul will cut a deal.

759
00:40:13,878 --> 00:40:15,789
And what if he doesn't?

760
00:40:22,987 --> 00:40:24,728
If Paul knew I was here...

761
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:28,730
He doesn't actually intend
to go through with the trial?

762
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:32,170
You've known him for 25 years.
What do you think?

763
00:40:32,497 --> 00:40:35,671
I think he's smart enough to realize...
Get off it, Jack.

764
00:40:36,367 --> 00:40:40,372
What makes him such a good lawyer
isn't his brains or his talent.

765
00:40:40,638 --> 00:40:43,812
It's that he refuses
to be intimidated by anyone.

766
00:40:44,142 --> 00:40:46,554
You know
he'd never kill someone.

767
00:40:47,845 --> 00:40:49,552
Furini implicated him.

768
00:40:49,714 --> 00:40:52,251
Paul only listened to them,
for God's sake.

769
00:40:53,184 --> 00:40:55,164
He helped them
to bribe a juror.

770
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:56,756
You can't prove that.

771
00:40:57,388 --> 00:40:58,628
(SCOFFS)

772
00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:00,499
Why am I wasting my breath?

773
00:41:01,426 --> 00:41:04,999
I've been watching the two of you arm
wrestle for a quarter of a century.

774
00:41:09,167 --> 00:41:11,670
This isn't personal, Anna.
Oh, no?

775
00:41:13,271 --> 00:41:14,579
Think about it.

776
00:41:15,573 --> 00:41:19,521
Would you have pushed this hard if
wasn't Paul at the other table?

777
00:41:19,577 --> 00:41:24,185
Would you really have gone that extra mile
to beat some Joe Schmo defense attorney?

778
00:41:25,984 --> 00:41:29,796
All right, maybe
Paul wanted to win too much.

779
00:41:30,788 --> 00:41:33,701
But don't you see? You're
doing the same damn thing.

780
00:41:33,925 --> 00:41:36,633
Win at all costs.
And you know what?

781
00:41:38,129 --> 00:41:39,904
We're all gonna lose.

782
00:41:43,568 --> 00:41:47,311
I told you, Jack,
I'm not gonna roll on Dosso.

783
00:41:47,906 --> 00:41:51,820
He's a murderer He's my client.
I don't judge him.

784
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:54,488
You don't have to climb
into bed with him, either.

785
00:41:54,546 --> 00:41:55,684
That's where you're wrong.

786
00:41:55,747 --> 00:41:58,751
I gotta think like he thinks, do as he does.
I gotta become him.

787
00:41:58,816 --> 00:42:00,853
It's the only way
I can go into a courtroom

788
00:42:00,919 --> 00:42:03,092
and fight for him
with any passion at all.

789
00:42:03,154 --> 00:42:05,760
It's what makes
this system work, Jack.

790
00:42:05,823 --> 00:42:08,429
A criminal defense lawyer
who says to his client,

791
00:42:08,493 --> 00:42:10,200
"I'll meet you,
but only during office hours.

792
00:42:10,261 --> 00:42:12,867
"I'll talk with you, but I won't
have Christmas dinner at your house.

793
00:42:12,931 --> 00:42:14,501
"I'll defend you,

794
00:42:14,565 --> 00:42:17,637
"but I won't go to your grandson's
christening," is not doing his job.

795
00:42:17,702 --> 00:42:20,342
He's giving
the prosecution an edge.

796
00:42:20,405 --> 00:42:22,180
That's your only agenda?

797
00:42:23,474 --> 00:42:26,284
The best interest of the client?
Hell, no.

798
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:30,325
I hang out with Dosso because I love it.
It elevates me.

799
00:42:31,716 --> 00:42:35,186
I climbed Macho Mountain,
Jack, and it feels damn good.

800
00:42:35,787 --> 00:42:37,892
Is it really worth
throwing your life away?

801
00:42:37,956 --> 00:42:41,096
You're assuming you're going to
win this trial, Ms. Kincaid?

802
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:45,340
I'm offering you
a way out, Paul.

803
00:42:49,834 --> 00:42:52,144
Maybe you should listen to him.
Don't you see?

804
00:42:52,203 --> 00:42:56,652
He called this meeting.
It means his case is weak.

805
00:42:57,408 --> 00:43:01,550
This isn't a game of chicken. Oh,
yes, it is, and you just blinked.

806
00:43:02,447 --> 00:43:04,188
I'll see you at trial.

807
00:43:07,919 --> 00:43:11,196
The People of the State
of New York v. Paul Kopell.

808
00:43:11,556 --> 00:43:14,264
Twenty million people
versus one man.

809
00:43:14,926 --> 00:43:16,701
Think of the enormity of it.

810
00:43:16,761 --> 00:43:21,540
The full extent of the government's
resources and manpower against me.

811
00:43:22,867 --> 00:43:27,577
And what heinous crime did I commit?
I defended my client.

812
00:43:28,906 --> 00:43:30,943
Yes, I constantly hear
the snide remarks

813
00:43:31,008 --> 00:43:34,581
about the shark getting his
client off on a technicality.

814
00:43:34,846 --> 00:43:40,091
But hidden in those remarks is a
sigh of relief, a silent thank you.

815
00:43:42,653 --> 00:43:47,033
You may hate me, but you
sleep better because of me.

816
00:43:48,326 --> 00:43:52,604
You see, when a defense lawyer
steps into a courtroom

817
00:43:52,663 --> 00:43:56,543
and does everything in his power to
poke holes in the prosecutor's case

818
00:43:56,868 --> 00:43:58,541
and still fails,

819
00:43:59,437 --> 00:44:03,010
the chance that an innocent
man will be convicted is nil.

820
00:44:04,942 --> 00:44:07,388
We have an adversarial system.

821
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:10,257
I'm the adversary,

822
00:44:12,216 --> 00:44:15,493
but you cannot punish me
for it. Thank you.

823
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:20,025
Defense attorneys
distort the facts.

824
00:44:20,558 --> 00:44:22,367
They twist evidence.

825
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:25,201
They will not only go to
the mat for their clients,

826
00:44:25,263 --> 00:44:29,541
they will take that mat and toss it
out the window as far as they can.

827
00:44:30,201 --> 00:44:32,545
They are not bound
by the truth.

828
00:44:33,905 --> 00:44:38,479
They are bound to obfuscate it if it
serves to get their clients acquitted.

829
00:44:38,543 --> 00:44:43,049
And they should be commended for it,
and it is what makes the system work.

830
00:44:44,816 --> 00:44:50,164
But when Paul Kopell picked David
Lempert's name off of a jury list,

831
00:44:50,488 --> 00:44:53,401
he was no longer functioning
as an attorney.

832
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:56,297
He was part
of a criminal conspiracy.

833
00:44:58,096 --> 00:45:01,236
He didn't fire the shots
into David Lempert's chest.

834
00:45:03,201 --> 00:45:05,841
He fired them
into our justice system.

835
00:45:09,107 --> 00:45:10,916
And he should go to prison.

836
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:24,993
JUDGE BONELLI: On the sole
count of the indictment,

837

Conspiracy to Commit Murder in the
Second Degree, how do you find?

838
00:45:30,028 --> 00:45:32,872
We find the defendant,
Paul Kopell, guilty.
