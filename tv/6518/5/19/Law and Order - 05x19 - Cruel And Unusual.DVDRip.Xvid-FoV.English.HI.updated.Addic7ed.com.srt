NARRATOR:
In the criminal justice system

2
00:00:02,603 --> 00:00:06,449
the people are represented by two
separate yet equally important groups,

3
00:00:06,507 --> 00:00:08,384
the police
who investigate crime

4
00:00:08,442 --> 00:00:11,252
and the district attorneys
who prosecute the offenders.

5
00:00:11,311 --> 00:00:13,018

in the head, okay?

64
00:03:51,164 --> 00:03:53,269
Hard enough to kill himself?

way you get a suspect's attention.

try to make sense out of that.

off the hot seat for him.

Mike can climb off the hook.

What was his problem?

much sugar in his diet?

had a thing about watches.

you don't understand here.

You see, when Kevin was 10,
he started to hurt himself.

148
00:08:25,105 --> 00:08:30,453
He would bite himself. He would
bang his head into walls. He...

149
00:08:32,812 --> 00:08:36,350
It would go in cycles. Every
six months, then more often.

150
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:40,326
By the time he was 13,
it would last for weeks.

151
00:08:40,887 --> 00:08:44,858

It's been hard on all of us.

00:08:57,704 --> 00:08:59,980
ELEANOR: Dr. Colter.
He runs the clinic.

157
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:03,819
Thanks to him,
Kevin was learning to draw.

158
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,787
We noticed he was missing
yesterday morning.

159
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:15,324
We thought
he might've gone home.

160
00:09:15,955 --> 00:09:18,595
That's why
we called his parents first.

161
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:20,966
So, what did he do?
He just walked out?

162
00:09:21,027 --> 00:09:24,008
Pretty much.
He went out a fire exit.

163
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:25,975
We'd like to talk
to his roommate.

164
00:09:26,032 --> 00:09:27,534
David Vilardi.

165
00:09:28,101 --> 00:09:31,082
He's non-verbal.
Anyway, he slept through it.

166
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:34,980
What's this for, Dr. Colter?
It's all covered with cracks.

167
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:40,157
Kevin wore that when he became
self-injurious, hitting himself.

168
00:09:40,947 --> 00:09:43,587
It's pretty common
with some autistic children.

169
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:47,594
DR. COLTER: It's frustration because
of their inability to communicate.

170
00:09:48,354 --> 00:09:51,665
That's why Kevin was here. So
we could modify that behavior.

171
00:09:52,492 --> 00:09:53,527
Modify?

172
00:09:54,461 --> 00:09:56,964
Well, no disrespect to you,
Doctor, but the way that sounds,

173
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:59,340
it's making my skin crawl.

174
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:01,973
There's nothing sinister
about it.

175
00:10:02,035 --> 00:10:04,015
Granted, sometimes we have
to restrain the child

176
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:06,141
until the self-injurious
cycle passes.

177
00:10:06,206 --> 00:10:08,345
Did Kevin get restrained
a lot lately?

178
00:10:08,408 --> 00:10:10,115
Not as often as before.

179
00:10:10,176 --> 00:10:11,211
Oh.

180
00:10:12,045 --> 00:10:14,958
Well, maybe you can
explain this to me.

181
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:19,125
This is what Kevin looked
like when we found him.

182
00:10:19,219 --> 00:10:22,200
You see those bruises
and the marks on his neck?

183
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:26,202
Well, you're a doctor. Maybe you
can tell me how they got there.

184
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,497
Like I said,
Kevin was self-injurious.

185
00:10:30,864 --> 00:10:34,812
ALONSO: We put them in a chair or on their
stomach on a padded board, right here.

186
00:10:34,868 --> 00:10:36,677
Put it down. Put it down.

187
00:10:38,104 --> 00:10:40,516
Then we hold them there
using soft cuffs.

188
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:43,383
Well, we found calluses
on his wrists and ankles.

189
00:10:43,443 --> 00:10:46,617
Well, that's how we strap them
in, plus across the chest.

190
00:10:46,746 --> 00:10:47,884
It's for their own protection.

191
00:10:47,947 --> 00:10:49,449
What about the neck?

192
00:10:49,516 --> 00:10:51,553
You got to be kidding me.
No.

193
00:10:52,619 --> 00:10:57,090
Well, if he had calluses, he must have
been strapped in for quite a while.

194
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:59,103
He was in a bad cycle
the past week.

195
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:02,003
We put him in restraints
about four hours every day.

196
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:05,769
The day he ran away, he was
on the board till about 6:00.

197
00:11:05,865 --> 00:11:07,003
Then he was fine.

198
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:08,773
Did he mind being strapped in?

199
00:11:08,868 --> 00:11:13,112
Well, he minded. Way it works is we get
four people to grab his legs and arms,

200
00:11:13,473 --> 00:11:14,611
and we lay him out.

(CHILDREN MUMBLING)

So, if he throws a punch, maybe one of you
thinks you have to throw a couple back.

203
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,359
Kevin didn't need anybody's
help to injure himself.

is for some of these kids?

(GRUNTING)

Bad days, they don't stop.

207
00:11:43,803 --> 00:11:46,807
It's a tough call. Kevin Jeffries
could've done it all to himself.

208
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:50,446
He punched himself in the carotid
artery till he got a blood clot?

209
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:53,787
Hey, he threw himself against walls.
He bounced off the ceiling.

210
00:11:53,847 --> 00:11:55,485
I mean, it all
could've been self-inflicted.

211
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:58,529
Then, how do we explain this?
The ME's final report.

212
00:11:58,585 --> 00:12:01,031
She found circular wounds
and muscle damage

213
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:02,897
consistent
with electric shocks.

214
00:12:02,956 --> 00:12:05,334
How many people
electrocute themselves?

215
00:12:11,698 --> 00:12:15,077
I'm very proud of what we
do here and how we do it.

216
00:12:15,268 --> 00:12:18,477
We believe in rewards,
positive reinforcement.

217
00:12:19,105 --> 00:12:22,985
But if they get out of line, someone
zaps them with a few volts, right?

218
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:27,615
Our medical examiner found evidence that
Kevin Jeffries was getting electric shocks.

219
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,718
Yes. It's part of the overall
aversion therapy program.

220
00:12:30,783 --> 00:12:33,229
Aversion?
What happened to the carrot?

221
00:12:33,386 --> 00:12:37,562
All we do is use mild punishment to
stop the self-injurious behavior.

222
00:12:37,891 --> 00:12:41,168
Rewards for good behavior,
mild punishment for bad.

223
00:12:41,561 --> 00:12:44,565
Usually we spray their mouths
with pepper juice, or pinch them.

224
00:12:44,631 --> 00:12:46,633
What about the electric shocks?

00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:50,141
That's only for the tough cases.
I'll show you.

226
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:55,917
Most clinics who work with autistic children
use drugs to sedate their patients.

227
00:12:55,975 --> 00:12:57,716
I don't believe in drugs.

228
00:12:58,344 --> 00:12:59,823
We substitute this.

229
00:13:01,047 --> 00:13:03,891
We apply this
to the patient's arm or leg.

230
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:06,260
It's controlled by this device.

231
00:13:06,319 --> 00:13:10,165
If the child starts to harm
himself, we give him a small shock.

232
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,833
I'd be happy to demonstrate.

233
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:15,268
Yeah, try it on me.
That's fine.

234

Roll up your sleeve, please.

(SCOFFS)

243
00:13:43,222 --> 00:13:46,032
Dr. Colter's aversion therapy
isn't revolutionary.

244
00:13:46,693 --> 00:13:49,333
A lot of programs are based
on behavior modification.

245
00:13:49,395 --> 00:13:50,840
They use electrodes, too?

246
00:13:50,897 --> 00:13:52,467
No. Just Dr. Colter.

247
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:54,838
He's the only one
who takes the tough cases.

248
00:13:54,901 --> 00:13:56,847
The kids other
institutions don't want.

249
00:13:56,903 --> 00:14:00,146
You actually believe
his zap therapy works?

250
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:02,546
If we didn't, we wouldn't
be subsidizing him.

251
00:14:02,608 --> 00:14:07,387
$175,000 a year per patient.
Currently he has 83 patients.

252
00:14:07,447 --> 00:14:09,120
That makes for
a fat bottom line.

253

When's the last time somebody checked
to see what he does with the money?

LOGAN: What about the zappers?
Do you review them?

256
00:14:15,655 --> 00:14:20,035
Yes. Dr. Colter's applied four
times in the past six years

257
00:14:20,093 --> 00:14:22,073
to increase the voltage
on the devices.

258
00:14:22,128 --> 00:14:25,268
Apparently the patients were
becoming immune to the shocks.

259
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:27,242
Well, that tells me
it wasn't working.

260
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:31,043
Our board of reviewers checked the
patients' files. They saw progress.

Look, we monitor
this therapy very closely.

262
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:37,885
It's approved on a case-by-case basis
and only with the parents' consent.

263
00:14:37,944 --> 00:14:39,252
I can't imagine any parents

264
00:14:39,312 --> 00:14:42,293
letting their kid get electrical
shocks all over his body.

265
00:14:42,348 --> 00:14:45,693
The electrodes can only be used on the
forearm or the thigh. Nowhere else.

266
00:14:45,752 --> 00:14:49,598
And no more than four shocks can be
administered during a one-hour period.

267
00:14:49,655 --> 00:14:52,261
Well, then, we have a problem
because according to our ME,

268
00:14:52,325 --> 00:14:56,398
Kevin Jeffries had shock marks all
over his chest and all over his back.

269
00:14:59,332 --> 00:15:03,610
Of course we knew about the punishments.
That's why we sent Kevin to Dr. Colter.

270
00:15:03,936 --> 00:15:07,042
We didn't want him doped up and
warehoused in some hospital.

271
00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:10,485
Yeah, well, did Colter tell you
about these electric shocks?

272
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:13,487
Yes. I don't see
what the problem is here.

273
00:15:13,546 --> 00:15:15,651
I thought Kevin's injuries
were self-inflicted.

274
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:20,091
We checked with the State agency.
Dr. Colter was using electrodes on your son

275
00:15:20,153 --> 00:15:22,155
in ways
that he wasn't supposed to.

276
00:15:22,221 --> 00:15:25,395
There's got to be a mistake. He
told us Kevin was almost cured.

277
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:28,234
He said he was hardly using
the electrodes anymore.

278
00:15:28,294 --> 00:15:31,104
Well, that's not the way
it looks, Mr. Jeffries.

279
00:15:31,831 --> 00:15:36,177
Quite a cure. That kid was still trying
to punch himself when he died in my arms.

280
00:15:36,335 --> 00:15:40,078
Well, the ME said the boy was bruised
and the shock marks were recent.

281
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:43,018
Doesn't exactly jibe with
Dr. Colter's bill of goods.

282
00:15:43,075 --> 00:15:45,715
I'll tell you
what it jibes with. Abuse.

283
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:48,782
The kid was being tortured
with a couple of AA batteries.

284
00:15:48,848 --> 00:15:49,986
For what, thrills?

285
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:52,586
What about those
$175,000 subsidies?

286
00:15:52,652 --> 00:15:55,326
I, for one, think Colter
was conning the State

287
00:15:55,388 --> 00:15:57,459
into thinking his clinic
was helping those kids.

288
00:15:57,523 --> 00:15:59,560
Do we know
for a fact it wasn't?

289
00:16:02,762 --> 00:16:06,107
If you thought your kid was being
abused, what would you do?

290
00:16:06,232 --> 00:16:08,508
This is America.
I'd sue the bastard.

291
00:16:09,068 --> 00:16:10,479
Maybe someone did.

It's only an hour's drive, so
we can see her every weekend.

294
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:22,054
She's a beautiful girl,
Mrs. Davidson.

295
00:16:22,115 --> 00:16:24,220
She'll be 14 next week.

296
00:16:25,017 --> 00:16:27,395
We're having a party
here at the house.

297
00:16:28,254 --> 00:16:32,327
The progress she's made at Lynchburg
is nothing short of a miracle.

298
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:34,736
Well, do they know something
that Colter doesn't?

299
00:16:34,794 --> 00:16:36,205
Oh, and then some.

300
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:41,039
At the behavioral clinic, they sprayed her
with pepper juice. They used electrodes.

301
00:16:41,534 --> 00:16:44,674
But at Lynchburg, they're
given positive reinforcement.

302
00:16:44,737 --> 00:16:47,013
They're taught
relaxation techniques.

303
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:50,016
Did Colter have your consent
to use electrodes?

304
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:54,481
Yes, he did. He gave us a demonstration.
It seemed harmless.

305
00:16:55,581 --> 00:16:59,119
You have got to understand that
my husband and I were desperate.

306
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,354
Well, why did you sue him?

307
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:03,661
Because there is a line,
and Colter crossed it

308
00:17:03,723 --> 00:17:06,329
when he put Cathy in that
medieval torture helmet.

309
00:17:06,726 --> 00:17:10,765
A helmet? Well, we saw kids with
hockey helmets to protect their heads.

310
00:17:10,963 --> 00:17:14,103
No, there's another one.
They call it the buzzbox.

311
00:17:15,668 --> 00:17:18,274
SERENA: It works on
sensory deprivation.

312
00:17:21,641 --> 00:17:23,985
The child can't see anything.

313
00:17:24,944 --> 00:17:28,084
There's a buzzer inside the
box that makes a white noise,

314
00:17:28,147 --> 00:17:30,718
and so the child
can't hear anything.

315
00:17:30,783 --> 00:17:32,285
It's supposed
to calm them down.

316
00:17:32,351 --> 00:17:35,594
He kept Cathy in this helmet
for three straight days.

317
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:39,265
She had bruises
on her neck right here.

318
00:17:41,594 --> 00:17:43,164
She passed out
while she was wearing it.

319
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:46,335
We only found out because
Cathy happened to tell us.

320
00:17:46,966 --> 00:17:48,604
That's when we sued.

321
00:17:48,668 --> 00:17:51,171
Let me guess. Colter
made a quick settlement?

322
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:54,707
No, he settled, all right, as soon
as we proved that this helmet

323
00:17:54,774 --> 00:17:57,812
cut off the blood supply
to our daughter's brain.

324
00:17:57,877 --> 00:17:58,981
Is he still using that?

325
00:17:59,045 --> 00:18:01,025
No, we made sure
that he wouldn't.

326
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,788
We got the State
to ban the use of this helmet.

327
00:18:04,617 --> 00:18:06,392
Nice piece of equipment.

328
00:18:06,619 --> 00:18:08,929
Something out of the Marquis
de Sade's catalogue?

329
00:18:08,988 --> 00:18:11,696
Apparently Dr. Colter
cooked this one up in his lab.

330
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:14,795
Could it have caused the blood
clot on Kevin Jeffries?

331
00:18:14,961 --> 00:18:17,942
Well, the helmet comes almost
all the way down the neck.

332
00:18:17,997 --> 00:18:20,136
The repetitive carotid damage
occurred here,

333
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:21,940
five centimeters
below the left ear.

334
00:18:22,001 --> 00:18:24,572
Same place the Davidson girl
had the bruises.

335
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,681
So it's possible
that could've killed him?

336
00:18:26,739 --> 00:18:29,242
Yes, I'd say
it's the probable cause.

337
00:18:29,509 --> 00:18:32,251
Bring me the helmet,
and I'll tell you for sure.

Two weeks ago he takes a
night job to pay some bills.

I just want to be
very clear here, Mr. Garvey.

376
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:20,993
Was Dr. Colter aware of what was
going on at the clinic at night?

Oh, not so fast.

Let's hear what he has to say.

Colter's the one who strapped
him in before he left.

381
00:20:34,533 --> 00:20:36,809
He put the electrodes
on the boy's chest and back?

382
00:20:36,869 --> 00:20:40,646
Yeah. He told me
to shock him every 10 minutes.

383
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:45,120
He told me it was all
part of the aversion therapy.

384
00:20:46,645 --> 00:20:48,147
I didn't wanna hurt him.

385
00:20:48,214 --> 00:20:54,028
Did you ever put a helmet like this one on
Kevin Jeffries or any of the other kids?

386
00:20:55,354 --> 00:20:58,824
No. No, I've never
seen anything like it.

387
00:21:02,028 --> 00:21:03,666
Before I arrest Colter
for assault,

388
00:21:03,729 --> 00:21:06,972
I need to know I'm not stepping
onto a half-frozen lake.

389
00:21:08,067 --> 00:21:10,911
Can he legitimately claim
what he's doing is therapy?

390
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:12,381
Twenty years ago he could've.

391
00:21:12,438 --> 00:21:15,783
Aversion therapy was the hot new thing
to treat alcoholics and drug addicts.

392
00:21:15,841 --> 00:21:18,378
But it's a quick fix.
It doesn't really work.

393
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:21,015
Well, apparently he's convinced
the State that it does.

394
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:24,152
That's because he can show
them short-term improvements.

395
00:21:24,216 --> 00:21:27,288
The problem is the patients
develop a tolerance for the pain,

396
00:21:27,353 --> 00:21:29,128
and the old behavior
comes back.

397
00:21:29,188 --> 00:21:31,327
That's why he had to use
more powerful electrodes.

398
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:33,495
More pain to achieve
the same results.

399

A true believer. That just
makes him more frightening.

406

Have the police pick him up.

407
00:21:54,814 --> 00:22:00,594
Assault? Next you'll arrest my allergist
for injecting me twice a month.

408
00:22:00,853 --> 00:22:04,198
If he put you in four-point restraints
and shocked you every 10 minutes,

409
00:22:04,256 --> 00:22:05,360
I'd consider it.

410
00:22:05,424 --> 00:22:07,062
It's part of the therapy.

411
00:22:07,126 --> 00:22:08,628
It's all State sanctioned.

412
00:22:08,694 --> 00:22:11,538
They didn't sanction
what we found at your clinic.

413
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:14,904
This boy was given shocks
every 10 minutes on his torso

414
00:22:14,967 --> 00:22:18,471
with electrodes 20 times more
powerful than the industry norm.

415

They're closer to cattle prods
than anything used on humans.

You thumbed your nose
at State guidelines,

417
00:22:23,576 --> 00:22:26,056
and one boy may very well
be dead as a result.

418
00:22:26,112 --> 00:22:29,116
That's nonsense. I'm down in the
trenches every day with those children,

00:22:35,254 --> 00:22:37,564
Is that why you
continue to use this?

422
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:43,002
Of course not.
What are you talking about?

423
00:22:43,062 --> 00:22:45,440
We found marks
on Kevin Jeffries' neck,

424
00:22:45,798 --> 00:22:49,177
the same marks that Cathy Davidson
got from wearing that helmet.

425
00:22:49,235 --> 00:22:52,216
Kevin gave himself those injuries.
He was out of control.

426

You told his parents
he was practically cured.

Whatever your motives,
your actions are criminal,

B.F. Skinner a genius.

program is merely an extension

436

of Skinner's

is often painful.

with an arrest warrant.

441
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:46,364
Wait a minute.

442
00:23:46,926 --> 00:23:50,601
Chemotherapy is a far cry from
assaulting someone with electrodes.

443
00:23:50,696 --> 00:23:54,337
Think about it. It's only assault
if the patient doesn't consent

444
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,277
or if Dr. Colter
intended to hurt them.

445
00:23:56,335 --> 00:23:57,780
Or he was reckless.

446
00:23:58,404 --> 00:24:01,317
These children have shown
marked improvement.

447
00:24:02,141 --> 00:24:04,417
Now, how reckless can he be?

448
00:24:05,678 --> 00:24:07,180
He's got a point, Mr. McCoy.

449

JACK: The People don't concede there
have been long-lasting improvements.

450
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:14,261
Regardless, Dr. Colter
broke every State regulation.

451
00:24:14,553 --> 00:24:16,590
He crossed the line
between therapy and abuse.

452
00:24:16,655 --> 00:24:19,192
Your Honor, the only issue here

453
00:24:19,992 --> 00:24:23,804
is whether Dr. Colter received
parental consent for his therapy.

454
00:24:23,862 --> 00:24:24,932
Informed consent.

455
00:24:24,997 --> 00:24:26,908
Well, then,
let's ask the parents

456
00:24:26,966 --> 00:24:28,673
whether they know
what they consented to?

457
00:24:28,734 --> 00:24:30,111
It's a good idea.

458
00:24:30,836 --> 00:24:33,009
I'll hear from them
in the morning.

459
00:24:33,272 --> 00:24:36,276
NANCY: Nobody,
no State hospital,

460
00:24:36,609 --> 00:24:39,351
no doctor would have
anything to do with Robbie.

461
00:24:40,446 --> 00:24:43,154
Dr. Colter was the only one
who would take him.

462
00:24:46,018 --> 00:24:48,396
He showed us
how the electrodes worked.

463
00:24:50,756 --> 00:24:53,999
It was very difficult
watching Robbie in pain.

464
00:24:55,427 --> 00:24:59,034
But it only lasted a couple of seconds,
and then Robbie would calm down.

465
00:24:59,098 --> 00:25:03,046
Did he explain how often the shocks
would have to be administered?

466
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:04,370
Yes.

467
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:08,816
He said sometimes as often
as every 10 minutes.

468
00:25:09,408 --> 00:25:12,218
Were you aware that violated
the State guidelines?

469
00:25:12,444 --> 00:25:13,445
Yes.

470
00:25:14,413 --> 00:25:16,620
But if it worked,
I didn't care.

471
00:25:17,583 --> 00:25:20,086
Three years ago
the experts told us

472
00:25:20,152 --> 00:25:22,632
our son didn't belong
in the education system.

473
00:25:23,789 --> 00:25:26,292
One principal even
called him "subhuman."

474
00:25:28,494 --> 00:25:32,704
Now Robbie works at a computer,
thanks to Dr. Colter.

475
00:25:33,632 --> 00:25:36,044
GOLDEN: It's not like
anything you've ever seen.

476
00:25:36,635 --> 00:25:39,445
Kids pulling their hair out,
their teeth.

477
00:25:40,773 --> 00:25:45,051
You give my kid a pencil, he's gonna jab
it into his cheek, for crying out loud.

478
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:49,559
Did Dr. Colter tell you his therapy
went beyond what the State allowed

479
00:25:49,615 --> 00:25:51,424
in frequency and intensity?

480
00:25:51,483 --> 00:25:52,723
What do they know?

481
00:25:53,585 --> 00:25:56,998
Is it better my kid become a
drugged-out blob with open wounds?

482
00:25:57,790 --> 00:26:00,964
They got some chutzpah telling
me what to do with my kid.

483
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:05,333
I'm his legal guardian. I should be the
one who decides what happens to him.

484
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:08,972
Thank you for coming in,
Mr. Golden.

485
00:26:13,806 --> 00:26:17,777
Seems to me these parents went into
this with their eyes wide open.

486
00:26:18,177 --> 00:26:21,784
If the parents are satisfied with
Dr. Colter's work, then so am I.

487
00:26:21,914 --> 00:26:23,655
The People are not, Your Honor.

488
00:26:23,716 --> 00:26:26,560
The defendant made unauthorized
use of this therapy

489
00:26:27,086 --> 00:26:29,088
in violation of
State guidelines.

490
00:26:29,154 --> 00:26:33,398
Which justifies an administrative
hearing, not a criminal trial.

491
00:26:35,894 --> 00:26:38,431
Now, the indictment
for assault is quashed.

492
00:26:40,232 --> 00:26:42,508
What do you expect?
These are the '90s.

493
00:26:42,668 --> 00:26:46,241
People don't want the State telling
them how to raise their kids.

494
00:26:46,305 --> 00:26:50,276
He's convinced these parents he's
right, that his therapy actually works.

495
00:26:51,076 --> 00:26:52,919
It didn't work
for Kevin Jeffries.

496
00:26:52,978 --> 00:26:54,548
The Jeffries kid, yeah.

497
00:26:55,047 --> 00:26:57,493
The parents might've consented
to Colter's therapy,

498
00:26:57,549 --> 00:26:59,426
but they can't consent
to murder.

499
00:26:59,485 --> 00:27:01,692
There's no murder
without the helmet.

500
00:27:02,187 --> 00:27:05,066
My bet is Colter took
a sledgehammer to it

501
00:27:05,124 --> 00:27:07,536
the minute Kevin Jeffries
death hit the news.

502
00:27:07,826 --> 00:27:09,931
Jack, I may have
found something.

503
00:27:10,262 --> 00:27:13,937
That's the Davidsons' initial complaint
in the suit about the buzzbox helmet.

504
00:27:13,999 --> 00:27:15,945
There are 13 named defendants.

505
00:27:16,502 --> 00:27:18,948
That's civil litigation.
You name everyone in sight.

506
00:27:19,004 --> 00:27:22,383
Yeah, that's right, but take a
look at the amended complaint.

507
00:27:23,375 --> 00:27:25,878
There are only
12 named defendants.

508
00:27:26,879 --> 00:27:29,689
An occupational therapist,
Josh Bingham, was dropped.

509
00:27:29,748 --> 00:27:33,924
It could be because he had testimony
that would bolster the plaintiff's case.

510
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:36,021
(WHISTLE BLOWING)

511
00:27:36,088 --> 00:27:38,329
All right, then, all right.
Don't push off.

512
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:43,633
I graduated from Columbia
with a degree in psych.

513
00:27:44,396 --> 00:27:46,000
That job was a nightmare.

514
00:27:46,064 --> 00:27:48,544
I work for three months,
then get named in a lawsuit.

515
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,409
You settled
with the Davidsons early?

516
00:27:50,469 --> 00:27:51,504
Are you kidding?

517
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:53,015
I agreed to testify for them.

518
00:27:53,072 --> 00:27:56,281
I wrote a 23-page affidavit about
what was going on at that clinic.

519
00:27:56,341 --> 00:28:00,153
Let me tell you. Colter?
He'd make Dr. Mengele proud.

520
00:28:00,612 --> 00:28:02,922
You saw what was going on, but
you continued to work there?

521
00:28:02,981 --> 00:28:05,552
Well, the first time
I saw him use that buzzbox,

522
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:08,631
I went right down to Colter's office.
He read me this long laundry list

523
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:11,133
of his success stories,
told me I'd get used to it.

524
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:14,330
I went right back down to my office,
started looking at the "help wanted" ads.

525
00:28:14,393 --> 00:28:17,931
Let me tell you, it's a good thing for
those kids that the Davidsons came along.

526
00:28:17,996 --> 00:28:20,977
Do you think Colter's still
using the buzzbox helmet?

527
00:28:21,567 --> 00:28:24,480
What, and risk getting hit
with another lawsuit?

528
00:28:24,636 --> 00:28:28,140
Actually, we think it killed one
of his patients, Kevin Jeffries.

529
00:28:28,207 --> 00:28:30,209
That's what we'd like to prove.

530
00:28:31,443 --> 00:28:33,753
Maybe I know someone
who can help you.

531
00:28:33,912 --> 00:28:37,689
Francine Randazzo.
One of the therapy assistants.

532
00:28:38,851 --> 00:28:41,730
She stayed on at the clinic
after the Davidson thing.

533
00:28:41,787 --> 00:28:43,698
Why would she talk to us now?

534
00:28:44,857 --> 00:28:47,838
She called me a couple of
weeks ago looking for work.

535
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,865
She got laid off
from the clinic.

536
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:57,437
After the Davidson lawsuit,
they used the helmet less.

537
00:28:57,502 --> 00:29:01,416
Only in extreme cases. We weren't
supposed to even talk about it.

538
00:29:02,307 --> 00:29:04,548
Ms. Randazzo,
were you still working there

539
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:06,556
when Kevin Jeffries
was undergoing treatment?

540
00:29:06,612 --> 00:29:09,183
Yes. It broke my heart.

541
00:29:09,281 --> 00:29:12,626
He'd be like you and me for a couple of
days, and then he'd totally freak out.

542
00:29:12,684 --> 00:29:15,130
He'd start slamming his head
against the wall.

543
00:29:15,187 --> 00:29:19,658
When he started doing this, did
Dr. Colter use the buzzbox helmet on him?

544
00:29:19,725 --> 00:29:20,726
Yes.

545
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:25,540
Sometimes he'd strap Kevin in a chair
for three or four days at a time.

546
00:29:25,831 --> 00:29:26,969
With the helmet?

547
00:29:27,032 --> 00:29:28,136
That's right.

548
00:29:28,867 --> 00:29:30,710
I couldn't even look at him.

549
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:35,141
He'd only let him out to go to
the bathroom and take a shower.

550
00:29:37,876 --> 00:29:40,789
Excuse me!
Dr. Colter is with a patient!

551
00:29:40,846 --> 00:29:41,916
Then, we're just in time.

552
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:43,653
WOMAN: You can't go in there!

553
00:29:44,016 --> 00:29:46,622
Come on, come on, hold him. What's going on?
This is private.

554
00:29:46,685 --> 00:29:49,632
Not any more, it's not. Alan
Colter, you're under arrest

555
00:29:49,688 --> 00:29:53,158
for the murder of Kevin Jeffries. You
have the right to remain silent.

556
00:29:53,225 --> 00:29:55,171
Anything you do say,
can and will...

557
00:29:57,162 --> 00:29:59,665
And this
is your reliable witness?

558
00:30:00,866 --> 00:30:04,336
Oh, I'm sure Ms. Randazzo

559
00:30:04,536 --> 00:30:08,484
is just dying to throw bouquets
at the employer who laid her off.

560
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:11,419
Dr. Colter gave her a job
for the last two years.

561
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,414
He must think she's reliable.

562
00:30:13,512 --> 00:30:16,220
What, and after three weeks
of job interviews,

563
00:30:16,281 --> 00:30:18,727
she suddenly finds
his methods abhorrent?

564
00:30:19,318 --> 00:30:21,798
She had the chance
to speak up months ago.

565
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:26,391
Anything she says now is gonna smell a
little ripe to a jury, don't you think?

566
00:30:26,458 --> 00:30:29,769
Not if it confirms what they
hear from the medical examiner.

567
00:30:30,429 --> 00:30:34,104
We no longer use the
deprivation helmet. Period.

568
00:30:35,334 --> 00:30:38,611
Misguided as the State's decision
was, we went along with it.

569
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:41,844
It's statements like that, Dr. Colter,
that make me wonder if you did.

570
00:30:41,907 --> 00:30:43,944
ROTHENBERG: Then,
don't take his word for it.

571
00:30:44,142 --> 00:30:46,019
We have an eyewitness
who'll testify

572
00:30:46,078 --> 00:30:48,786
that the helmet was never used
on Kevin Jeffries.

573
00:30:49,748 --> 00:30:51,921
His roommate, David Vilardi.

574
00:30:52,217 --> 00:30:53,890
An autistic child?

575
00:30:54,052 --> 00:30:56,965
We're not talking about a
potted plant, Mr. McCoy.

576
00:30:57,389 --> 00:30:59,892
According to this report,
Kevin's roommate is mute.

577
00:30:59,958 --> 00:31:03,565
He can still communicate with
the help of a facilitator.

578
00:31:03,829 --> 00:31:06,105
That's all fine and good,
but how could he possibly know

579
00:31:06,164 --> 00:31:07,666
what you did to Kevin Jeffries?

580
00:31:07,733 --> 00:31:09,212
They were roommates

581
00:31:09,968 --> 00:31:11,811
in a very small institution.

582
00:31:13,638 --> 00:31:17,643
How long do you think something like
this could've been kept secret?

583
00:31:23,915 --> 00:31:27,089
Now, Mrs. Vilardi is going
to stabilize David's hand

584
00:31:27,185 --> 00:31:31,429
so that he can point accurately, but
she's not going to guide his answers.

585
00:31:32,491 --> 00:31:33,731
Mrs. Vilardi.

586
00:31:37,662 --> 00:31:40,575
Ask my son anything
you want, Mr. McCoy.

587
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:44,811
David, do you know
why you're here today?

588
00:31:49,041 --> 00:31:50,042
"Yes."

589
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:54,989
Did you ever see
Kevin wearing a helmet?

590
00:31:59,284 --> 00:32:00,285
"Yes."

591
00:32:00,686 --> 00:32:02,393
(KEYBOARD CLICKING)

592
00:32:03,054 --> 00:32:04,055
"White"

593
00:32:06,224 --> 00:32:07,225
"helmet."

594
00:32:09,194 --> 00:32:12,141
You mean the white hockey
helmet he wore for protection?

595
00:32:16,168 --> 00:32:17,169
"Yes."

596
00:32:19,037 --> 00:32:22,075
Did you ever see him wearing
any other kind of helmet?

597
00:32:23,108 --> 00:32:24,109
"No."

598
00:32:27,412 --> 00:32:28,686
"Just the white"

599
00:32:30,449 --> 00:32:31,450
"helmet."

600
00:32:37,022 --> 00:32:41,368
Did he ever tell you that Dr. Colter
made him wear another kind of helmet?

601
00:32:43,495 --> 00:32:44,496
"No."

602
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:47,967
Did he ever mention something
called the buzzbox?

603
00:32:50,202 --> 00:32:51,203
"No."

604
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:55,550
Are you absolutely sure
he never mentioned it?

605
00:32:57,909 --> 00:32:58,979
"Yes."

606
00:33:02,013 --> 00:33:05,017
"Kevin only wore"

607
00:33:06,518 --> 00:33:09,556
"the white helmet,"

608
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:14,163
"not the red."

609
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:23,138
I've read David's file. He's
been non-verbal all his life.

610
00:33:23,201 --> 00:33:24,680
His IQ was measured at 30.

611
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:27,478
There's no record he's ever
been taught to read or write.

612
00:33:27,539 --> 00:33:29,485
All of a sudden
he's typing on a computer.

613
00:33:29,541 --> 00:33:30,611
Pretty neat trick.

614
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:32,586
DR. OLIVET:
There's an even better trick.

615
00:33:32,711 --> 00:33:35,123
David's IQ was retested after
he started communicating,

616
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:37,854
and he scored
between 100 and 130.

617
00:33:38,083 --> 00:33:41,087
Which probably coincides
with his mother's IQ.

618
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:44,926
She was holding his hands.
She was guiding his responses.

619
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:48,528
Well, you don't think this facilitated
communication is for real.

620
00:33:48,593 --> 00:33:51,233
It's been around since the mid-'70s,
and it's still taught at universities,

621
00:33:51,296 --> 00:33:54,675
but by and large the scientific
community does not support it.

622
00:33:54,733 --> 00:33:58,044
That's the bottom line.
I'll move for a hearing.

623
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:03,282
If the technique isn't generally accepted,
David's not qualified to be a witness.

624
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:08,520
JACK: Frye v. US
is very clear, Your Honor.

625
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:10,992
Until a scientific technique
gains general acceptance,

626
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:13,086
it can't be used in evidence.

627
00:34:13,251 --> 00:34:15,060
General acceptance by whom?

628
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:18,557
Neurologists? Speech pathologists?
Special education teachers?

629
00:34:18,623 --> 00:34:20,796
These people can't even agree
on what causes autism.

630
00:34:20,859 --> 00:34:24,102
Two courts have already agreed
that facilitated communication

631
00:34:24,162 --> 00:34:26,403
doesn't meet the standard
for scientific evidence.

632
00:34:26,464 --> 00:34:28,637
So, a couple of family
court judges were guided

633
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:31,112
by their prejudice
against the disabled.

634
00:34:31,303 --> 00:34:32,338
Mr. Rothenberg.

635
00:34:32,404 --> 00:34:34,816
That's what it boils down to,
Your Honor.

636
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:39,146
People with disabilities are being denied
their opportunity to be heard in court.

637
00:34:39,211 --> 00:34:42,749
I just want to be sure the voice
being heard is David Vilardi's.

638
00:34:42,881 --> 00:34:46,829
Mr. McCoy, making that determination
is why I wear the robe.

639
00:34:47,953 --> 00:34:51,332
I've heard the legal arguments. Now
I'd like to hear from some experts

640
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:53,596
who know
what they're talking about.

641
00:34:54,225 --> 00:34:56,865
And I'd also like to hear
from David himself.

642
00:35:00,198 --> 00:35:02,974
I've worked with autistic
children for the past 20 years.

643
00:35:03,034 --> 00:35:06,504
I've read all the studies done
on facilitated communication,

644
00:35:06,571 --> 00:35:08,744
and I've seen it
used in the field.

645
00:35:09,141 --> 00:35:13,590
I haven't seen anything I consider
sufficient to say it's valid.

646
00:35:14,246 --> 00:35:16,419
You don't think it works,
Dr. Chaikin?

647
00:35:16,481 --> 00:35:19,985
There's no proof of its reliability
with autistic children.

648
00:35:20,619 --> 00:35:24,931
In my opinion, the messages reflect
the facilitator's coaching.

649
00:35:25,457 --> 00:35:27,698
Are you saying that
there's deception involved?

650
00:35:27,759 --> 00:35:30,899
DR. CHAIKIN: No. More like
wishful thinking.

651
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:34,773
For parents, there's nothing better in
the world than to have your child say,

652
00:35:34,833 --> 00:35:37,313
"I love you,"
and have a true sense of it.

653
00:35:37,436 --> 00:35:39,541
Autistic children
can't do that.

654
00:35:40,038 --> 00:35:44,384
So, when something comes along that
promises meaningful communication,

655
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:48,780
parents and people who work with
autistic children believe in it.

656
00:35:49,648 --> 00:35:51,559
Thank you. No more questions.

657
00:35:53,118 --> 00:35:57,999
Dr. Chaikin, does
facilitated communication

658
00:35:58,056 --> 00:35:59,535
have its proponents?

659
00:35:59,591 --> 00:36:01,969
Yes. So do Ouija boards.

660
00:36:02,761 --> 00:36:05,332
Do you know of any
university-affiliated institutions

661
00:36:05,397 --> 00:36:07,843
dedicated to
the study of Ouija boards?

662
00:36:09,501 --> 00:36:11,606
No, I don't.
And are you familiar

663
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:15,482
with the Facilitated Communication
Institute at Syracuse University?

664
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,183
Yes, I am.

665
00:36:17,375 --> 00:36:18,513
No more questions.

666
00:36:20,378 --> 00:36:24,588
I've seen the technique used
successfully with the autistic,

667
00:36:24,749 --> 00:36:28,219
with people with Down syndrome,
with cerebral palsy.

668
00:36:28,286 --> 00:36:32,359
And do you consider the technique generally
accepted by people in your field?

669
00:36:32,424 --> 00:36:35,894
It is gaining wider acceptance
with teachers and parents.

670
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,530
It's being used in the schools.

671
00:36:37,596 --> 00:36:40,440
Thousands of people have been
trained as facilitators.

672
00:36:40,799 --> 00:36:44,645
It's not the holy grail of
autism, but it's very important.

673
00:36:44,703 --> 00:36:46,011
Thank you.

674
00:36:47,639 --> 00:36:51,587
Dr. Gerard, are there empirical
studies validating this technique

675
00:36:51,743 --> 00:36:53,051
that you're aware of?

676
00:36:53,111 --> 00:36:54,146
DR. GERARD: No.

677
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:57,557
It's not like the law of gravity.
It can't be proven that way.

678
00:36:57,616 --> 00:37:00,995
Are there established procedures
for monitoring facilitators?

679
00:37:01,853 --> 00:37:03,457
None that are
generally accepted.

680
00:37:03,521 --> 00:37:06,400
Is it fair to say this
technique is experimental?

681
00:37:07,192 --> 00:37:09,297
Well, the research
isn't complete yet.

682
00:37:09,361 --> 00:37:10,999
Thank you.
No more questions.

683
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:14,838
MRS. VILARDI: The first word
David typed was "water."

684
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:16,608
He was thirsty.

685
00:37:17,402 --> 00:37:21,350
That was five months ago, when David
first started living at the clinic.

686
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:24,620
Since then we have
regular conversations.

687
00:37:26,011 --> 00:37:31,393
I found out my son has a sense of humor.
He likes girls. He writes poetry.

688
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,025
He loves his family.

689
00:37:35,153 --> 00:37:38,259
After all these years,
I found my child.

690
00:37:39,858 --> 00:37:42,702
Thank you.
No more questions.

691
00:37:51,036 --> 00:37:52,515
Mrs. Vilardi,

692
00:37:54,172 --> 00:37:55,981
I'd like to show
something to David.

693
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,212
Go right ahead.

694
00:38:02,013 --> 00:38:04,755
If you don't mind,
would you look the other way?

695
00:38:10,355 --> 00:38:11,766
Your Honor?

696
00:38:12,257 --> 00:38:15,966
Mrs. Vilardi,
do as Mr. McCoy asks.

697
00:38:30,709 --> 00:38:33,280
David, please look at the card.

698
00:38:42,587 --> 00:38:44,726
You can turn around,
Mrs. Vilardi.

699
00:38:48,059 --> 00:38:51,336
David, please tell us what's
on the card I just showed you.

700
00:39:07,145 --> 00:39:08,647
Did he get it right?

701
00:39:09,414 --> 00:39:12,190
No. I'm sorry.

702
00:39:13,652 --> 00:39:17,156
No more questions. He's just nervous.
Let him see it again.

703
00:39:17,622 --> 00:39:21,502
Mr. McCoy, show the witness the
card one more time, please.

704
00:39:24,229 --> 00:39:25,469
RIVERA: Mrs. Vilardi.

705
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:37,447
David, look at the card.

706
00:39:43,615 --> 00:39:45,754
David, tell us
what's on the card.

707
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:12,410
RIVERA: All right,
Mrs. Vilardi, you're excused.

708
00:40:12,477 --> 00:40:14,013
MRS. VILARDI:
This isn't fair.

709
00:40:14,646 --> 00:40:16,751
David just doesn't understand
what you want.

710
00:40:16,815 --> 00:40:17,953
Mrs. Vilardi, please.

711
00:40:18,016 --> 00:40:19,461
You're not being fair!

712
00:40:20,752 --> 00:40:24,859
Dr. Colter, please explain to them
they're not giving him a chance.

713
00:40:24,923 --> 00:40:27,062
Mrs. Vilardi, please.

714
00:40:30,028 --> 00:40:31,507
You're excused.

715
00:40:36,601 --> 00:40:39,445
We just got a judge to tell Mrs. Vilardi
that she's been talking to herself

716
00:40:39,504 --> 00:40:41,245
for the last five months.

717
00:40:41,706 --> 00:40:44,186
That doesn't exactly make me
want to jump up and cheer.

718
00:40:44,242 --> 00:40:48,884
Just a minute. We didn't drag this boy into
the spotlight. Our good doctor did that.

719
00:40:50,148 --> 00:40:52,719
Placing his interests
ahead of his patients'.

720
00:40:52,851 --> 00:40:55,957
I don't think his patients
even figured in the equation.

721
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:59,695
None of which put us any closer to proving
he used the helmet on Kevin Jeffries.

722
00:40:59,757 --> 00:41:02,363
Anyone confirmed
Ms. Randazzo's testimony?

723
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:06,665
We reinterviewed the employees.
They all say they didn't know.

724
00:41:12,003 --> 00:41:14,483
Maybe somebody already told us
what we need.

725
00:41:17,809 --> 00:41:20,517
David Vilardi entered
the clinic five months ago,

726
00:41:20,578 --> 00:41:23,752
after the State had already
banned the use of the helmet.

727
00:41:23,982 --> 00:41:28,089
We can assume neither he nor
his mother ever saw it.

728
00:41:28,553 --> 00:41:29,998
That's what they said
in their deposition.

729
00:41:30,054 --> 00:41:33,729
They also said that Kevin
never wore the red helmet.

730
00:41:34,692 --> 00:41:36,296
How would they know
what color it is?

731
00:41:36,361 --> 00:41:37,499
Ask them.

732
00:41:39,998 --> 00:41:43,002
Three people saw it
on the television monitor.

733
00:41:44,402 --> 00:41:46,177
We heard you say it.

734
00:41:46,904 --> 00:41:49,646
Maybe one of the other kids
told him it was red.

735
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:55,355
Mrs. Vilardi, I don't wanna put
your son through another ordeal.

736
00:41:56,247 --> 00:41:58,693
Maybe I told him.
I can't remember.

737
00:41:58,783 --> 00:42:00,228
How did you know?

738
00:42:02,287 --> 00:42:04,289
Have you seen the helmet?

739
00:42:04,722 --> 00:42:06,360
I saw a picture of it.

740
00:42:06,424 --> 00:42:07,494
Where?

741
00:42:11,462 --> 00:42:13,567
You've seen it used,
haven't you?

742
00:42:16,935 --> 00:42:19,745
I can compel your answer,
Mrs. Vilardi.

743
00:42:20,705 --> 00:42:22,582
Yes, I've seen it.

744
00:42:22,874 --> 00:42:24,217
On Kevin Jeffries?

745
00:42:28,947 --> 00:42:30,654
They use it on your son.

746
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:33,521
It works, Mr. McCoy.

747
00:42:33,785 --> 00:42:36,493
A boy died because
he was forced to wear it.

748
00:42:37,822 --> 00:42:39,495
My David is alive.

749
00:42:40,825 --> 00:42:43,135
More alive than he's ever been.

750
00:42:43,895 --> 00:42:49,140
Whatever harm that helmet might do, it's
not as bad as what David did to himself.

751
00:42:49,934 --> 00:42:52,881
He broke his fingers
biting into them.

752
00:42:54,205 --> 00:42:58,551
He spent weeks screaming and
throwing himself on the ground.

753
00:42:59,877 --> 00:43:02,221
Now he tells me he loves me.

754
00:43:04,615 --> 00:43:06,822
I'll put her on the stand,
Doctor.

755
00:43:07,518 --> 00:43:10,658
She'll corroborate
Francine Randazzo's testimony.

756
00:43:10,722 --> 00:43:13,168
ROTHENBERG: I may be
a little slow this morning,

757
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:16,466
but I didn't hear you say that she
saw Kevin Jeffries wear the helmet.

758
00:43:16,527 --> 00:43:19,167
Your client authorized
its continued use.

759
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:23,110
Which makes him criminally liable for
any death that occurs as a result.

760
00:43:23,868 --> 00:43:26,815
JACK: I don't need direct
evidence to convict him.

761
00:43:42,086 --> 00:43:45,829
He pleads nolo to man two.
He pays a fine.

762
00:43:46,991 --> 00:43:48,732
He does community service.

763
00:43:54,732 --> 00:44:01,047
He pleads guilty to man two. He serves two years.
He turns in his license.

764
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:04,549
He closes the clinic.

765
00:44:07,545 --> 00:44:09,286
You want to put me
out of business, huh?

766
00:44:09,347 --> 00:44:11,327
We understand
each other perfectly.

767
00:44:11,382 --> 00:44:15,091
You may not like my methods,
but they get results.

768
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:18,362
You beat a dog often enough,
it'll stop barking.

769
00:44:19,257 --> 00:44:23,364
It might even do tricks for you,
but I wouldn't call that humane.

770
00:44:23,461 --> 00:44:26,305
Don't you dare lecture me
on what's humane.

771
00:44:26,931 --> 00:44:30,469
I've seen the way people react to my patients.
They're repulsed.

772
00:44:30,635 --> 00:44:33,707
These children are
what nightmares are made of.

773
00:44:34,739 --> 00:44:38,778
But I don't look away. I make
something of their broken lives.

774
00:44:39,911 --> 00:44:42,892
You made sure Kevin Jeffries's
life could never be fixed.

775
00:44:43,181 --> 00:44:45,684
Can you really tell me
he's not better off?

776
00:44:51,055 --> 00:44:54,400
I hope that's not your closing
statement to the jury.

777
00:44:54,659 --> 00:44:57,435
You'll never convince them
he murdered that boy.

778
00:44:57,495 --> 00:44:58,803
Watch me.

779
00:44:58,863 --> 00:45:03,209
When I tell them how much money he made
torturing these kids with electrodes,

780
00:45:03,301 --> 00:45:05,907
that he nearly killed
the Davidson girl,

781
00:45:06,337 --> 00:45:10,046
he'll be lucky if they don't
string him up in the courtroom.

782
00:45:16,013 --> 00:45:19,586
The court is satisfied that the
defendant has met the conditions

783
00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:21,254
of the plea agreement.

784
00:45:22,153 --> 00:45:24,292
In accordance
with that agreement,

785
00:45:24,889 --> 00:45:29,599
this court sentences Alan Colter to
a term of not less than two years

786
00:45:30,094 --> 00:45:31,664
and not more than six years

787
00:45:31,729 --> 00:45:35,404
at a facility to be determined
by the Department of Correction.

788
00:45:37,201 --> 00:45:39,044
And this court is adjourned.

789
00:45:45,643 --> 00:45:48,681
He still has them convinced
he was saving their children.

790
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:51,625
The only thing he tried to
save was his reputation.

791
00:45:52,450 --> 00:45:54,430
He knew the therapy
wasn't getting results.

792
00:45:54,485 --> 00:45:57,091
Instead of admitting he was wrong,
he just turned up the voltage.

793
00:45:57,155 --> 00:45:58,463
MRS. VILARDI: Mr. McCoy.

794
00:46:02,226 --> 00:46:05,537
You made them
close the clinic. Why?

795
00:46:07,231 --> 00:46:09,438
Mrs. Vilardi...
They sent him home.

796
00:46:10,101 --> 00:46:14,846
I can't take care of him. I don't
know what I'm going to do with him.

797
00:46:15,907 --> 00:46:18,751
You took away
the only place he had.

798
00:46:21,145 --> 00:46:23,352
Do you want him, Mr. McCoy?

799
00:46:24,649 --> 00:46:26,560
Can he go home with you now?

800
00:46:31,088 --> 00:46:32,499
I didn't think so.
