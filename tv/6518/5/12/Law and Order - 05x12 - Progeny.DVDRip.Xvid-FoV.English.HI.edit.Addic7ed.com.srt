NARRATOR:
In the criminal justice system

2
00:00:03,036 --> 00:00:06,916
the people are represented by two
separate yet equally important groups,

3
00:00:06,974 --> 00:00:08,783
the police
who investigate crime

4
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:11,652
and the district attorneys
who prosecute the offenders.

5
00:00:11,712 --> 00:00:13,419
These are their stories.

6
00:00:14,581 --> 00:00:17,289
Yeah, I get a pain. Only
when I do my jump shot dunk,

7
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:19,194
bang, and that's when
I start feeling pain.

8
00:00:19,253 --> 00:00:20,960
Another guy,
he makes the shots for me.

9
00:00:21,722 --> 00:00:23,099
All I'm saying is...

10
00:00:23,156 --> 00:00:24,658
Jamal, Jamal!

11
00:00:24,725 --> 00:00:26,398
Yeah?
Get her car.

12
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:29,498
Oh, no, Frank is getting it, man.
Frank is gonna get it.

13
00:00:29,763 --> 00:00:31,868
So, listen, you think I should
work it off, you know...

14
00:00:31,932 --> 00:00:33,934
You know, I'm really
not that kind of a doctor.

15
00:00:34,001 --> 00:00:37,642
I could recommend somebody to see you.
Call my office, okay?

16
00:00:38,772 --> 00:00:40,809
MAN: Hey, don't block it in,
all right?

17
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:41,875
Thanks.

18
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:51,054
Big help, you know
what I'm saying?

19
00:00:51,118 --> 00:00:52,791
She gonna pay the bill,
too, man?

20
00:00:52,853 --> 00:00:55,356
You get cars here,
Jamal, not Medicare!

21
00:00:56,623 --> 00:00:58,102
Oliver, you saying
I can't talk to customers...

22
00:00:58,158 --> 00:00:59,159
No... now and then?
Come on, man.

23
00:00:59,226 --> 00:01:00,796
What, you making up
rules on me, Oliver?

24
00:01:02,029 --> 00:01:03,474

26
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:06,609
(CAR HORN BLARING)

27
00:01:11,605 --> 00:01:13,607
What is it?
What's going on?

28
00:01:15,309 --> 00:01:17,414
What happened?
Don't touch this, man.

29
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:21,248
Two 9 millimeter shell casings.

30
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:24,029
One here, one there.

31
00:01:24,851 --> 00:01:27,024
And one slug is in that Toyota,

32
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:29,499
and the other one
blew through her head.

33
00:01:30,424 --> 00:01:33,769
Okay, so the shooter was
standing where, about here?

34
00:01:33,961 --> 00:01:36,271
Car comes around
the corner, bang, bang.

35
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:38,173
And then he's out that door.

36
00:01:38,865 --> 00:01:40,469
Anyone see anything outside?

37
00:01:40,534 --> 00:01:43,447
Yeah, everybody saw a lot of people.
Midtown, noon.

38
00:01:43,503 --> 00:01:45,744
But nobody running,
nobody waving a gun.

39
00:01:45,806 --> 00:01:47,717
Well, this guy just
walked away.

40
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:48,844
This looks like a hit.

41
00:01:48,909 --> 00:01:50,445
What, on a nice lady doctor?

42
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:51,750
Look at this.

43
00:01:55,015 --> 00:01:58,189
BRISCOE: A nice lady doctor
wearing a bullet-proof vest.

44
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:02,063
I didn't realize the health
care debate was so heated.

45
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:03,157
It was for her.

46
00:02:04,391 --> 00:02:08,396
"Wanted, Dr. Eileen Reed, abortionist,
for mass murder. Reward."

47
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:09,873
Reward?

48
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:11,273
"God's eternal grace."

49
00:02:12,366 --> 00:02:13,845
Holy Mother.

50
00:03:08,255 --> 00:03:10,394
Two doctors shot dead
in Florida.

51
00:03:10,457 --> 00:03:12,562
And one in Buffalo
six weeks ago.

52
00:03:12,793 --> 00:03:16,400
Those are just out-of-town tryouts.
Now the show's in New York.

53
00:03:16,463 --> 00:03:18,238
The Florida shooters were
picked up at the scene.

54
00:03:18,298 --> 00:03:20,335
So was the guy in Buffalo.

55
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:23,476
Harold Malcolm.

56
00:03:24,504 --> 00:03:27,508
He was standing over the body
handing out leaflets.

57
00:03:27,574 --> 00:03:30,555
Well, there's a lot more
where those three came from.

58
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:32,556
Before we start
sorting through the nuts,

59
00:03:32,612 --> 00:03:36,150
are we sure this doctor's murder
is related to her line of work?

60
00:03:36,316 --> 00:03:38,728
Well, the wanted poster
is kind of a hint.

61
00:03:38,785 --> 00:03:41,197
The wanted poster
didn't pull the trigger.

62
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:42,892
Our lives will be a lot easier

63
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:46,597
if she was killed over a love
triangle or a gambling debt.

64
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:48,763
We'll go see the husband.

65
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:51,241
Maybe we'll get lucky
and he'll confess.

66
00:03:55,135 --> 00:03:57,979
I met Eileen in medical school

67
00:03:58,038 --> 00:04:00,712
during a pediatrics rotation.

68
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:04,787
Even then, she was working six
hours a week at a free clinic.

69
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:07,380
Dr. Reed,

70
00:04:07,547 --> 00:04:11,654
did your wife ever have any trouble
with any of her patients or colleagues?

71
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,163
No.
And the two of you?

72
00:04:14,488 --> 00:04:16,024
Any marital problems?

73
00:04:17,057 --> 00:04:19,799
I loved her.
She loved me.

74
00:04:20,694 --> 00:04:23,402
We just started trying
to have children.

75
00:04:27,234 --> 00:04:30,408
Is there some reason
you're avoiding the obvious?

76
00:04:30,871 --> 00:04:32,441
Eileen didn't
need to get involved,

77
00:04:32,506 --> 00:04:34,918
but she believed that all women
deserve good medical care,

78
00:04:34,975 --> 00:04:39,048
so she performed abortions two
afternoons a week at a women's clinic.

79
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,921
That's where she was going
when she got shot?

80
00:04:40,981 --> 00:04:44,053
That's why she was wearing
a bullet-proof vest.

81
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:47,288
The clinic is
surrounded by zealots.

82
00:04:47,354 --> 00:04:49,527
The doctors working there get
death threats all the time.

83
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:52,035
Like the one she had
in her purse.

84
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:54,000
That was a mild one.

85
00:04:55,395 --> 00:04:58,001
She was gonna send it to the police.
They send them all to the police

86
00:04:58,064 --> 00:05:01,511
so that maybe you can find
these people before they...

87
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:07,982
The paper's long grain,
twenty pound bond.

88
00:05:08,108 --> 00:05:10,554
Only a few billion sheets
a year sold in this country.

89
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:12,647
Any fingerprints?
Yours.

90
00:05:13,547 --> 00:05:14,924
And the victim's.

91
00:05:15,582 --> 00:05:16,959
It's a photocopy,

92
00:05:17,184 --> 00:05:20,461
from a machine with some dirt
on the drum. See these specks?

93
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:23,065
If you get me the machine
and it hasn't been serviced,

94
00:05:23,123 --> 00:05:25,467
I can maybe do a positive I.D.
Oh, great.

95
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:27,869
We'll organize a line-up
of Xerox machines.

96
00:05:27,928 --> 00:05:30,408
Well, what about
other threats that she got?

97
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:33,444
These arrived at the clinic
over the last six months.

98
00:05:33,767 --> 00:05:36,771
Any particular one
you want me to look at?

99
00:05:36,903 --> 00:05:37,904
Well...

100
00:05:39,239 --> 00:05:43,312
Maybe we'll just go there in person and
see who's been delivering their messages.

101
00:05:45,312 --> 00:05:46,552

Those are the regulars.

105

And that's Mark Bryant.

106
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:55,657
KATHERINE: He's the
pain-in-the-ass in chief.

107
00:05:56,823 --> 00:05:59,099
This guy, Bryant,
he's a photographer?

108
00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:01,068
Faces and license plates.

109
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:03,300
He tries to get
everybody coming in

110
00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:06,138
so he can track them down
and counsel them,

111
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:08,139
which means harass them.

112
00:06:10,837 --> 00:06:12,544
LOGAN: You telling me Dr. Reed
had to go through this

113
00:06:12,606 --> 00:06:14,552
every time she showed up?

114
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,779
We do what we can
to protect the doctors.

115
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:18,720
We never even
release their names.

116
00:06:18,778 --> 00:06:21,349
But Bryant, was he here
when she was here?

117
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:24,988
Bryant is always here.

118
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:28,865

in there, drag them out!

Protect your children.

120

We're the police, Mr. Bryant.
Good.

121
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:35,203
They're committing murder
in there. Do your duty.

122
00:06:35,262 --> 00:06:38,675
Yeah, well, we're investigating
the murder of Dr. Eileen Reed.

123
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:39,938
And you're looking at us?

124
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,413
Hey, you people aren't exactly handing
out bouquets to these doctors.

125
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:46,041
Listen, yesterday I had
twice as many rescuers here.

126
00:06:46,106 --> 00:06:47,847
Every time someone
fires a shot in our name,

127
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:49,581
it smears us
and reduces our numbers.

128
00:06:49,643 --> 00:06:51,919
Well, sure, nobody wants to get
in the way of a stray bullet.

129
00:06:51,978 --> 00:06:53,980
Nobody wants to be
associated with killing.

130
00:06:54,047 --> 00:06:55,117
We're here to prevent killing.

131
00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:56,455
Do you know what's
going on in there?

132
00:06:56,516 --> 00:06:58,359
Hey, what's going on
in there is legal.

133
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,489
We got a dead 35-year-old
woman on our hands.

134
00:07:00,553 --> 00:07:03,397
And we mourn her.
Violence begets violence.

135
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:04,833
We want it all to stop.

136
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:06,996
Hey, Bryant, how's your hobby?

137
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:09,403
You get any good pictures
of Dr. Reed?

138
00:07:09,863 --> 00:07:10,864
Several.

139
00:07:11,231 --> 00:07:14,678
But I didn't know her name
until I saw it on the news.

140
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:17,470
Well, they make a lot of
noise on the sidewalks

141
00:07:17,537 --> 00:07:20,074
and try to convince the women
going in to change their minds.

142
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:23,917
Then they refer them to a
pro-life pregnancy crisis center.

143
00:07:23,977 --> 00:07:25,012
Pro-life?

144
00:07:25,078 --> 00:07:28,719
You ever notice how some people's
concern for life stops at birth?

145
00:07:29,015 --> 00:07:30,551
They want those babies
to come out.

146
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:32,927
After that, they don't give a
damn what happens to them.

147
00:07:32,986 --> 00:07:36,263
Well, they seem to give a damn
about what happened to Dr. Reed.

148
00:07:36,323 --> 00:07:38,929
Their official policy
is anti-murder.

149
00:07:39,392 --> 00:07:41,929
Apparently while the doctor
was across town getting shot,

150
00:07:41,995 --> 00:07:44,134
Bryant and his people were
waiting for her at the clinic.

151
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:45,301
All of his people?

152
00:07:45,365 --> 00:07:47,845
BRISCOE: Hey, they claim they
didn't even know her name.

153
00:07:49,269 --> 00:07:52,307
Whoever shot her knew her name, her
address, and her office hours.

154
00:07:52,372 --> 00:07:54,648
Well, the clinic kept
that information secret.

155
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:57,245
Her private patients
knew where to find her.

156
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:01,986
Her patients are calling.

157
00:08:02,048 --> 00:08:03,721
Half of them are
about to give birth.

158
00:08:03,783 --> 00:08:05,956
The insurance companies
are driving me crazy.

159
00:08:06,019 --> 00:08:08,158
Did Dr. Reed perform
abortions here?

160
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:09,325
A few.

161
00:08:09,923 --> 00:08:11,994
Most of her patients
wanted to be pregnant.

162
00:08:12,058 --> 00:08:14,197
Did she have any new
patients the last few weeks?

163
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,103
YVONNE: She wasn't taking any.

164
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:18,372
But there was one.

165
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,501
Laura Lee.

166
00:08:19,566 --> 00:08:22,638
She called a few days before, said
she'd seen the doctor at the clinic.

167
00:08:22,702 --> 00:08:24,238
BRISCOE:
What, she had complications?

168
00:08:24,304 --> 00:08:25,874
It was only a consultation.

169
00:08:25,939 --> 00:08:27,782
She wanted
the follow-up here.

170
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:30,219
She asked for the last
appointment, whenever that was.

171
00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:33,723
That would be right before
Dr. Reed left for the clinic.

172
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,384
Yes, but she didn't show up.

173
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:37,257
BRISCOE: You have her number?
Here.

174
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,489
You got anything else on her?

175
00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:44,057
The clinic sent over
her paperwork.

176
00:08:49,329 --> 00:08:50,603
Dial-A-Prayer.

177
00:08:51,731 --> 00:08:54,439
We're gonna keep this, okay?

178
00:08:57,070 --> 00:09:00,313
Laura Lee. Initials L-L.

179
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,713
Like one of Superman's
girlfriends.

180
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:05,353
He won't be dating her.
She doesn't exist.

181
00:09:05,412 --> 00:09:06,652
Oh, Lois Lane does?

182
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:07,714
(CHUCKLES)

183
00:09:07,814 --> 00:09:09,851
Have you got prints
on those forms, or what?

184
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:13,489
A lovely set belonging
to one Ms. Nancy Gunther.

185
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:18,059
Arrested four months ago in
Schenectady for trespassing.

186
00:09:18,158 --> 00:09:19,330
Trespassing?

187
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:22,229
Sitting in at
a Planned Parenthood clinic.

188
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:28,103
You see, Miss Gunther, you being
such a pro-life activist and all,

189
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:30,338
we're wondering why
you showed up at a clinic

190
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:32,906
asking about
ending your pregnancy.

191
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,745
I never said
I wanted to do that.

192
00:09:36,976 --> 00:09:39,616
You never said your
real name, either.

193
00:09:41,648 --> 00:09:45,460
A lot of people give false names.
It's very personal.

194
00:09:47,287 --> 00:09:51,360
You gave a false name, but you
picked up a real one. Eileen Reed.

195
00:09:52,492 --> 00:09:56,497
The only people they tell the
doctors' names to are the patients.

196
00:09:56,563 --> 00:10:00,636
Yeah, you called and made an appointment
with her, but you never showed up.

197
00:10:02,302 --> 00:10:04,942
I changed my mind.
I'm keeping my baby.

198
00:10:05,238 --> 00:10:07,377
You were always gonna keep it,
weren't you?

199
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,283
You asked for the
last appointment of the day

200
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:12,380
so you'd know exactly when
she was leaving the office.

201
00:10:13,313 --> 00:10:15,190
Who'd you tell, Nancy?

202
00:10:17,183 --> 00:10:20,926
If you told the shooter,
that's conspiracy to murder.

203
00:10:24,691 --> 00:10:26,329
You better help us out, Nancy,

204
00:10:26,392 --> 00:10:30,670
or you're gonna be raising your baby
in a cell block at Bedford Hills.

205
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:34,541
If that's God's will.

206
00:10:39,772 --> 00:10:42,048
She's got nothing to say.
She asked for a lawyer.

207
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:45,055
Hey, let's arrest her for murder.
That might motivate her.

208
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:46,283
There's not enough to hold her.

209
00:10:46,346 --> 00:10:49,623
Her lawyer will say the missed
appointment's a coincidence.

210
00:10:50,016 --> 00:10:52,428
Oh, how's this
for a coincidence?

211
00:10:52,585 --> 00:10:54,929
That protest in Schenectady
where she was arrested,

212
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:56,695
27 people were taken in,

213
00:10:56,756 --> 00:10:59,066
including her
and Harold Malcolm.

214
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:01,666
What, the guy who shot
the doctor in Buffalo?

215
00:11:01,728 --> 00:11:03,605
Yeah, two months later.

216
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:06,872
The protest was led by
a Drew Seeley of Manhattan.

217
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:10,003
Oh, boy, this one's a real nut.

218
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:12,174
Defrocked priest.
Listen to this.

219
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:15,319
The Diocese of Schenectady has a
restraining order on this guy.

220
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:18,515
He can't come within 100 yards
of any of their churches.

221
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:22,590
Well, maybe he'll think confession's
still good for the soul.

222
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:28,759
Oh, yes, I know Nancy.
She's a fine Christian woman.

223
00:11:28,821 --> 00:11:30,459
And you know
Harold Malcolm, too?

224
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:31,968
I've prayed with him often.

225
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:34,232
Yeah, well, the reason we're
here is that some of your people

226
00:11:34,294 --> 00:11:36,774
have been doing
un-Christian things.

227
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:38,335
What do you mean?

228
00:11:38,398 --> 00:11:41,936
Well, Malcolm blasted a doctor
with a shotgun in Buffalo.

229
00:11:42,435 --> 00:11:46,315
We think Nancy Gunther might be involved
in the murder of a doctor in Manhattan.

230
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:48,613
Yes, the abortion doctors.

231
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:50,313
Four dead.

232
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:52,546
Isn't that wonderful?

233
00:11:54,614 --> 00:11:56,491
Come in, come in.

234
00:12:02,755 --> 00:12:04,894
Those doctors were
committing a holocaust.

235
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:06,801
And your solution is murder?

236
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,971
What ever happened
to turning the other cheek,

237
00:12:09,028 --> 00:12:10,473
loving thine enemy?

238
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:12,806
I will love my enemy.

239
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:15,936
But a child in the womb
doesn't have that opportunity.

240
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:17,403
SEELEY: Please.

241
00:12:18,705 --> 00:12:21,276
The Bible commands us...
It commands us

242
00:12:21,341 --> 00:12:23,184
to protect the weak
and the powerless.

243
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:26,156
Well, the State of New York
commands us not to kill.

244
00:12:26,212 --> 00:12:28,590
I think that's also mentioned
in the Bible someplace.

245
00:12:28,648 --> 00:12:30,787
My only goal here
is saving lives.

246
00:12:31,384 --> 00:12:33,864
You tell your followers
to shoot doctors?

247
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:36,728
They draw their own conclusions.
They don't need me.

248
00:12:36,789 --> 00:12:39,633
You happen to know who drew a
conclusion to shoot Dr. Reed?

249
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:40,693
No, I don't.

250
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,671
Or who talked to
Nancy Gunther lately?

251
00:12:43,663 --> 00:12:44,835
Nancy.

252
00:12:45,131 --> 00:12:48,408
Nancy gathered some information
on Dr. Reed for me.

253
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:53,514
I wanted the doctor's name and address
to try to persuade her to stop.

254
00:12:53,573 --> 00:12:55,211
Persuade her how?

255
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:57,812
Well, I tried to call her and
I sent her some literature.

256
00:12:57,877 --> 00:13:00,016
A "Wanted" poster.
Yes. That was mine.

257
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:03,822
So you think that calling her a
criminal is going to persuade her?

258
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:05,521
Well, nothing else had.

259
00:13:06,252 --> 00:13:08,528
Where were you around
noon on Tuesday?

260
00:13:09,155 --> 00:13:13,194
Well, I was at a conference
of the Council on Choice.

261
00:13:14,827 --> 00:13:17,865
He was here, all right, throwing
fake blood on the speakers.

262
00:13:17,931 --> 00:13:19,535
We filed a complaint.

263
00:13:19,599 --> 00:13:22,443
I take it you don't see
eye-to-eye with Seeley.

264
00:13:22,502 --> 00:13:23,606
He thinks I should be murdered

265
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:26,344
because I advocate reproductive
freedom for women.

266
00:13:26,406 --> 00:13:27,817
I think he should be in jail.

267
00:13:27,874 --> 00:13:29,751
For advocating murder?

268
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:32,688
If all he does is talk about it,
there isn't anything we can do.

269
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:34,156
You got anything more specific?

270
00:13:34,213 --> 00:13:36,250
He used to wave signs
and sit in.

271
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:39,228
Now he incites his
followers to kill people.

272
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:40,354
Because of people like him,

273
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:42,923
in 85% of the counties
in the United States,

274
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:45,993
there's not a single doctor
willing to perform abortions.

275
00:13:46,059 --> 00:13:48,562
Well, don't some doctors
just prefer not to?

276
00:13:48,628 --> 00:13:49,732
Yeah.

277
00:13:49,963 --> 00:13:53,137
And a lot of doctors prefer
not getting shot in the head.

278
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:55,569
If you believe
this crap of Seeley's,

279
00:13:55,635 --> 00:13:58,479
you can understand why
the guy pulled the trigger.

280
00:13:58,805 --> 00:14:00,443
That's the problem
with fanatics.

281
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:02,315
You get their followers
in the right frame of mind,

282
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:04,685
the next thing you know,
they're chugging Kool-Aid.

283
00:14:04,744 --> 00:14:07,281
I've got Drew Seeley's
arrest reports.

284
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:09,827
When he went from sitting in
to inciting murders,

285
00:14:09,882 --> 00:14:12,385
I bet he lost
a lot of supporters.

286
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:14,620
Right, we'll look and see
who used to get busted

287
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:17,634
at Seeley's sit-ins
and who doesn't anymore.

288
00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:26,335
You know why America
had a recession, detective?

289
00:14:26,966 --> 00:14:28,570
Something to do
with interest rates?

290
00:14:28,634 --> 00:14:31,240
And crime, drought,
earthquakes.

291
00:14:31,738 --> 00:14:34,810
Father Seeley says we're
being punished for our sins.

292
00:14:35,174 --> 00:14:39,122
If we don't get right with the Lord,
the United States may cease to exist.

293
00:14:39,178 --> 00:14:41,522
Well, Seeley's not
a Father anymore.

294
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:44,126
To me, he is.
The man's a prophet.

295
00:14:44,283 --> 00:14:46,786
Well, how come you're
not still out there with him?

296
00:14:46,853 --> 00:14:49,891
I would be,
but my husband got sick.

297
00:14:49,956 --> 00:14:51,367
I have to run the store.

298
00:14:54,293 --> 00:14:56,899
I marched against
the war in Vietnam

299
00:14:56,963 --> 00:14:59,239
and against
the nuclear arms race.

300
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:01,278
Now I march for life.

301
00:15:01,334 --> 00:15:04,042
I didn't think there was much
crossover between those movements.

302
00:15:04,103 --> 00:15:05,946
It's all about
respect for human life.

303
00:15:06,005 --> 00:15:07,177
Seems pretty clear to me.

304
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,914
Is that why you stopped
marching with Seeley?

305
00:15:10,176 --> 00:15:12,679
Abortion doctors are
a form of human life.

306
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:15,453
Seeley and I
parted ways on that point.

307
00:15:15,648 --> 00:15:18,094
Can you think of anybody who
might have taken Seeley's advice

308
00:15:18,151 --> 00:15:19,789
a little too seriously?

309
00:15:19,852 --> 00:15:21,195
And shot that doctor?

310
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:23,495
Believe me, if I knew,
I'd tell you.

311
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:26,399
Now, excuse me.
I have a customer waiting.

312
00:15:27,693 --> 00:15:30,731
Well, either they're still in love with
Seeley, or they haven't got a clue.

313
00:15:30,797 --> 00:15:32,037
Who's next?

314
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:34,934
Randall Jenkins,
432 Canal Street.

315
00:15:35,001 --> 00:15:37,413
Oh, good.
Then we can eat Chinese.

316
00:15:38,171 --> 00:15:40,310
Randall doesn't
live here anymore.

317
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:42,077
LOGAN: But he is your husband?

318
00:15:43,342 --> 00:15:44,980
We're getting divorced.

319
00:15:45,645 --> 00:15:48,285
Oh. Do you know
where we can find him?

320
00:15:49,482 --> 00:15:51,928
We really don't
keep in touch much.

321
00:15:51,984 --> 00:15:55,124
Do you know why he stopped
hanging out with Drew Seeley?

322
00:15:55,188 --> 00:15:56,292
He didn't.

323
00:15:56,589 --> 00:15:59,433
He still sends me literature
about saving my soul.

324
00:15:59,926 --> 00:16:02,167
Is there a return address
on the literature?

325
00:16:02,228 --> 00:16:03,536
I didn't check.

326
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:06,606
Look, we...
We just had some problems.

327
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:10,714
If you see him, don't even
say you saw me, all right?

328
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,974
She's scared of the guy.

329
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:19,248
He still follows Seeley, but he stopped
getting busted at the protests.

330
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:20,916
Randall Jenkins.

331
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:24,086
Eight months ago he burst into a
women's clinic on Long Island

332
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,720
and started roughing people up.

333
00:16:25,785 --> 00:16:28,857
He was arrested for assault
and sentenced to probation.

334
00:16:28,921 --> 00:16:31,561
Right. So he gets arrested
again, even for trespassing,

335
00:16:31,624 --> 00:16:33,069
he goes straight to the joint.

336
00:16:33,126 --> 00:16:35,538
And he's not afraid
of getting physical.

337
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:39,899
Well, maybe he needed to stay out of
jail to do something more important

338
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:41,940
like kill a doctor.

339
00:16:45,238 --> 00:16:47,184
From Jenkins'
probation officer.

340
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,652
His new address
and place of employment.

341
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:58,360
Hey, Silkowitzl
It's not insured.

342
00:17:00,086 --> 00:17:02,999
I don't expect them
to be geniuses.

343
00:17:03,055 --> 00:17:05,399
Keep the mustard
out of the ketchup

344
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:07,870
and don't bang
the carts into walls.

345
00:17:07,927 --> 00:17:11,465
Plus, they have to master the
recipe of boiling hot dogs, right?

346
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:13,399
Right.

347
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:16,646
We're looking for a guy named Randall Jenkins.
Is he back yet?

348
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:17,703
Jenkins.

349
00:17:18,137 --> 00:17:21,550
He fills his cart half with
dogs, half with pamphlets.

350
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:25,384
Now I got the only pro-life
frankfurters on the West Side.

351
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:26,752
So where is he?

352
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:29,923
He took Tuesday off.
Never did come back.

353
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:35,225
Tuesday. Let's get
a warrant.

354

What are you doing?
Come on, just open it.

355
00:17:43,596 --> 00:17:45,041
He is not dangerous, is he?

356
00:17:45,097 --> 00:17:46,838
Dangerous? You got the whole
police department here.

357
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:49,812
Just tell him you gotta fix
the radiator. Come on.

Okay.

370
00:18:42,221 --> 00:18:45,395
Seeley called. Van Buren wants
us to go pay him a visit.

You have the right
to remain silent.

Do we have a plea?

I committed no crime
in the eyes of the Lord.

lives are at risk

if Mr. Jenkins is
allowed bail, Your Honor.

It's babies who are at risk.

403
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:16,857
Mr. Jenkins surrendered as soon as
he became a suspect, Your Honor.

404
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:18,918
He's not likely to flee now.

Flight's not what
I'm worried about, counselor.

On behalf of the babies
who grow up to be doctors,

00:20:25,491 --> 00:20:26,799
bail is denied.

408
00:20:28,127 --> 00:20:31,506
A trial seems like a waste
of the taxpayers' money.

409
00:20:31,664 --> 00:20:34,508
We've got the gun,
your client's confessed.

410
00:20:35,334 --> 00:20:38,975
Are you so afraid to confront
Biblical law in a courtroom?

411
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:41,009
What is he doing here?

412
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,752
Mr. Jenkins has
asked Father Seeley

413
00:20:43,809 --> 00:20:46,221
to be in attendance
as his spiritual advisor.

414
00:20:48,414 --> 00:20:52,055
Well, in your capacity
as his legal advisor,

415
00:20:52,118 --> 00:20:54,029
would please tell
his spiritual advisor

416
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:57,966
that Mr. Jenkins has a 100%
chance of being convicted?

417
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:03,463
And you can drop the honorific.
He's no longer a priest.

418
00:21:04,296 --> 00:21:08,210
Our defense will be
justification.

419
00:21:08,968 --> 00:21:10,242
Justification?

420
00:21:10,336 --> 00:21:12,338
That was laughed out
of court in Florida.

421
00:21:12,405 --> 00:21:15,352
Maybe New York judges
are more sophisticated.

422
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:25,160
You're getting lousy advice from both
heaven and earth here, Mr. Jenkins.

423
00:21:25,217 --> 00:21:27,527
If you go to trial and lose,

424
00:21:28,354 --> 00:21:30,356
you'll draw a maximum sentence.

425
00:21:34,693 --> 00:21:37,264
"Then Peter and the other
Apostles answered,

426

"'We ought to obey God
rather than men."'

427
00:21:50,276 --> 00:21:52,586
He'd do better
pleading insanity.

428
00:21:52,645 --> 00:21:55,717
It's Seeley sitting there
pulling the strings.

429
00:21:56,549 --> 00:22:00,326
All we know that he actually does
is congratulate the murderers.

430
00:22:00,386 --> 00:22:03,333
We ought to be looking
at him for conspiracy.

431
00:22:03,522 --> 00:22:05,866
Oh, you want to revoke
his right to free speech?

432
00:22:05,925 --> 00:22:09,202
He's trying to revoke a woman's
Constitutional right to choose.

433
00:22:09,261 --> 00:22:11,639
Oh, so two wrongs make a right?

434
00:22:11,697 --> 00:22:14,075
Is that what they taught you
in Harvard Law School?

435
00:22:14,133 --> 00:22:16,704
Maybe we'd be better off
sticking to the case at hand.

436
00:22:16,769 --> 00:22:18,544
Case? What case?

437
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:20,446
Justification can
only be claimed

438
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:23,749
if the killer reasonably believes
they're protecting a human life

439
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:25,288
from imminent deadly force.

440
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:27,881
So Jenkins will claim that he
was protecting human lives

441
00:22:27,947 --> 00:22:31,019
from being terminated by Eileen
Reed when she got to the clinic.

442
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:33,085
First trimester embryos.

443
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:35,426
He'll be flying in the face
of statute and case law.

444
00:22:35,488 --> 00:22:36,523
And his attorney will say

445
00:22:36,589 --> 00:22:40,093
that all that matters is what Randall
Jenkins reasonably believed.

446
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:41,160
ADAM: Nope.

447
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:44,701
What matters now is what
Judge Newfield believes.

448
00:22:48,467 --> 00:22:52,882
JACK: Justifiable force can only be claimed
in defense of a person, Your Honor.

449
00:22:52,938 --> 00:22:55,475
Under New York law,
a fetus is not a person.

450
00:22:55,808 --> 00:22:59,255
That definition is explicitly
limited to the homicide statute.

451
00:22:59,345 --> 00:23:04,317
Fine. If there was no threat of homicide,
then Mr. Jenkins had no justification.

452
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:08,058
In the matter of
Danielle Smith, Your Honor.

453
00:23:08,954 --> 00:23:11,434
A court in this state
ruled that

454
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:15,905
an unborn child is a person for the
purpose of being protected from abuse

455
00:23:15,961 --> 00:23:18,737
by its mother's drinking
during her pregnancy.

456
00:23:19,265 --> 00:23:21,472
The context is very similar
to the present case.

457
00:23:21,534 --> 00:23:23,980
That mother's actions
were irresponsible.

458
00:23:24,036 --> 00:23:27,449
Dr. Reed's actions were protected
by the United States Constitution.

459
00:23:27,506 --> 00:23:31,249
Mr. Jenkins has to show
he reasonably believed

460
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:34,484
the fetuses he was protecting
from Dr. Reed are persons.

461
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:37,520
This decision makes
that view seem

462
00:23:38,217 --> 00:23:39,389
very reasonable.

463
00:23:39,451 --> 00:23:41,556
Mr. Jenkins cannot
reasonably believe

464
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,964
that a fetus is a person
in the context of abortion

465
00:23:44,023 --> 00:23:46,731
when the Supreme Court
has ruled that it isn't.

466
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:52,303
Don't you ever disagree with
the Supreme Court, Mr. McCoy?

467
00:23:53,299 --> 00:23:54,300
(SCOFFS)

468
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:57,576
NEWFIELD: The reasonableness
of Mr. Jenkins' views

469
00:23:57,636 --> 00:24:00,116
is a question of fact,
not of the law.

470
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:06,819
I'll let it go to the jury.

471
00:24:07,846 --> 00:24:08,984
If, in the course of the trial,

472
00:24:09,048 --> 00:24:11,426
the defense satisfies
its obligation

473
00:24:11,483 --> 00:24:16,262
to establish the other statutory
requirements of justification.

474
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:20,436
Judge Newfield's
playing politics.

475
00:24:20,492 --> 00:24:22,802
He's courting
the pro-life vote.

476
00:24:22,861 --> 00:24:24,602
Maybe
he's just pro-life.

477
00:24:26,365 --> 00:24:29,938
Jack, you say that like
he's pro vanilla ice cream.

478
00:24:30,336 --> 00:24:33,476
Claire, if we make this
trial about feminism,

479
00:24:33,539 --> 00:24:36,884
we'll be taking the bait
and arguing the wrong issues.

480
00:24:37,009 --> 00:24:38,511
Eileen Reed died

481
00:24:38,577 --> 00:24:42,286
because she was protecting a
woman's legal right to choose.

482
00:24:43,015 --> 00:24:44,392
Eileen Reed died

483
00:24:44,817 --> 00:24:48,094
because Randall Jenkins
put a bullet in her head.

484
00:24:52,591 --> 00:24:55,834
The bullet entered the skull two
centimeters above the left orbit.

485
00:24:55,894 --> 00:24:57,999
It passed through
the frontal and parietal lobes

486
00:24:58,063 --> 00:25:00,441
and exited through
the occipital skull.

487
00:25:00,666 --> 00:25:02,168
That gunshot was
the cause of death?

488
00:25:02,234 --> 00:25:03,372
Yes.

489
00:25:03,469 --> 00:25:04,846
Nothing further.

490
00:25:09,975 --> 00:25:13,684
Have you ever conducted an autopsy
on a pregnant woman, Dr. Rogers?

491
00:25:13,746 --> 00:25:15,657
Objection. Beyond
the scope of cross.

492
00:25:15,714 --> 00:25:17,819
This witness was called as
an expert on life and death.

493
00:25:17,883 --> 00:25:19,260
Dr. Reed's death.

494
00:25:19,985 --> 00:25:22,522
That's quite a narrow medical
specialty, isn't it?

495
00:25:22,588 --> 00:25:26,229
I'll allow the question,
Mr. Garnett, despite the sarcasm.

496
00:25:32,931 --> 00:25:36,071
Yes, I have conducted
autopsies on pregnant women.

497
00:25:36,135 --> 00:25:38,547
GARNETT: Does the fetus always die
at the same time as the mother?

498
00:25:38,604 --> 00:25:42,177
Different parts of the body
often die at different times.

499
00:25:42,941 --> 00:25:44,511
Have you ever heard
the phrase "brain dead"?

500
00:25:44,576 --> 00:25:46,249
That's not what I asked you,
Doctor.

501
00:25:46,312 --> 00:25:48,815
Fine. You like
this answer better?

502
00:25:49,715 --> 00:25:54,528
I've autopsied gunshot victims where
the fetus died first, then the brain,

503
00:25:55,354 --> 00:25:59,632
and the rest of the body's been kept
alive on life support for a week.

504
00:26:00,426 --> 00:26:02,269
Your question is moot, sir.

505
00:26:05,331 --> 00:26:08,505
NANCY: Well, I got Dr. Reed's
name when I went to that clinic.

506
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,773
I used it to get her address.

507
00:26:10,836 --> 00:26:12,144
It wasn't that hard.

508
00:26:12,204 --> 00:26:16,209
And the information you obtained about
her, you gave it to Randall Jenkins?

509
00:26:16,275 --> 00:26:18,983
Well, I gave it to
Father Seeley first.

510
00:26:19,178 --> 00:26:20,919
Then Randy asked about it.

511
00:26:21,513 --> 00:26:23,789
I didn't see any harm
in telling him.

512
00:26:23,949 --> 00:26:25,019
When you went to the clinic,

513
00:26:25,084 --> 00:26:27,792
pretending you wanted to
terminate your pregnancy,

514
00:26:27,853 --> 00:26:29,560
what did Dr. Reed do?

515
00:26:32,624 --> 00:26:35,434
Did Dr. Reed give you
an abortion?

516
00:26:35,694 --> 00:26:37,037
I didn't want one.

517
00:26:37,096 --> 00:26:39,042
But Dr. Reed
didn't know that.

518
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:41,843
Did she start preparing
to give you one?

519
00:26:42,401 --> 00:26:43,402
No.

520
00:26:44,369 --> 00:26:45,370
Why not?

521
00:26:48,707 --> 00:26:50,709
She said I seemed unsure.

522
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:54,621
She wanted me to take a few
days to make up my mind.

523
00:26:55,848 --> 00:26:59,591
So your pregnancy wasn't in
any imminent danger, was it?

524
00:26:59,885 --> 00:27:00,886
No.

525
00:27:06,024 --> 00:27:07,662
When Mr. Jenkins

526
00:27:08,694 --> 00:27:10,367
asked you for
Dr. Reed's schedule,

527
00:27:10,429 --> 00:27:12,238
why did you give it to him?

528
00:27:12,331 --> 00:27:13,332
Why not?

529
00:27:13,699 --> 00:27:14,939
I knew Randy.

530
00:27:15,234 --> 00:27:17,475
He devoted his life
to the pre-born.

531
00:27:17,536 --> 00:27:20,483
How else did he show
his devotion?

532
00:27:20,539 --> 00:27:22,644
NANCY:
Randy mailed out letters,

533
00:27:23,075 --> 00:27:25,055
he handed out flyers,

534
00:27:25,611 --> 00:27:28,649
he did sidewalk counseling
outside of clinics,

535
00:27:28,947 --> 00:27:30,051
he sat in.

536
00:27:30,582 --> 00:27:33,324
He chained himself to clinic doors
so they couldn't be opened.

537
00:27:33,385 --> 00:27:36,662
So, shooting Dr. Reed

538
00:27:37,089 --> 00:27:38,727
wasn't the first thing he did

539
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:41,532
in his efforts to save
the pre-born?

540
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:42,961
No.

541
00:27:43,829 --> 00:27:45,775
No, he tried non-violence.

542
00:27:46,365 --> 00:27:47,673
It didn't work.

543
00:27:48,233 --> 00:27:49,337
GARNETT: Thank you.

544
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:54,749
She's not just testifying
for him, she's lying for him.

545
00:27:54,806 --> 00:27:58,379
Jenkins was violent at least once
before at that clinic on Long Island.

546
00:27:58,443 --> 00:28:00,116
Maybe she didn't know.

547
00:28:00,279 --> 00:28:01,917
He ran amok
in an abortion clinic.

548
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:03,721
That's a badge of honor
among these people.

549
00:28:03,782 --> 00:28:05,523
Why wouldn't he tell her?

550
00:28:06,552 --> 00:28:08,156
It might've even
helped the defense show

551
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:12,327
that Jenkins tried other lesser
means before resorting to murder.

552
00:28:13,492 --> 00:28:15,665
Find out why
he kept it to himself.

553
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:21,435
They sneak up
to the window sometimes.

554
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,946
There'll be a scared college
girl waiting for the procedure,

555
00:28:24,002 --> 00:28:27,245
and some creep will be going,
"Save a life, don't take one."

556
00:28:27,306 --> 00:28:29,786
I got the impression Randall
Jenkins did a lot more than that.

557
00:28:29,841 --> 00:28:30,842
Oh, yeah.

558
00:28:30,943 --> 00:28:32,854
I'd like to find out when
he's having a prostate exam

559
00:28:32,911 --> 00:28:34,584
and pull him off the table.

560
00:28:34,646 --> 00:28:36,319
He got into an examining room?

561
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:38,918
Knocked over two secretaries
and a nurse to get there.

562
00:28:38,984 --> 00:28:40,827
He seemed to be
after a particular patient.

563
00:28:40,886 --> 00:28:42,888
But none of the patients
testified against him.

564
00:28:42,955 --> 00:28:46,528
She was gone by the time the police
arrived, and she never came back.

565
00:28:46,592 --> 00:28:48,435
Joan Smith. In the city.

566
00:28:48,694 --> 00:28:50,605
432 Canal Street.

567
00:28:56,435 --> 00:28:57,436
JOANNA: Yes?

568
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:59,208
Miss Smith?

569
00:29:00,505 --> 00:29:03,247
Or should I say
Mrs. Jenkins?

570
00:29:08,013 --> 00:29:11,688
When Randy asked me to marry him,
I thought that was what I wanted.

571
00:29:12,885 --> 00:29:14,421
People make mistakes.

572
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:15,624
They grow.

573
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:18,234
Randy doesn't grow.

574
00:29:18,624 --> 00:29:20,001
He never changes.

575
00:29:21,894 --> 00:29:25,706
No matter what happens, he stays
precisely, exactly the same.

576
00:29:26,398 --> 00:29:27,775
But you changed.

577
00:29:31,036 --> 00:29:33,073
When I found out
I was pregnant,

578
00:29:34,339 --> 00:29:37,752
it meant I either had to
stay with Randy

579
00:29:38,877 --> 00:29:41,016
or raise the baby by myself.

580
00:29:45,817 --> 00:29:48,457
I don't have any money, I...

581
00:29:52,524 --> 00:29:54,731
It was so hard
to decide what to do.

582
00:30:01,833 --> 00:30:03,938
Randy followed you
to the clinic?

583
00:30:07,172 --> 00:30:08,173
Yeah.

584
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:09,917
I ran away.

585
00:30:13,045 --> 00:30:16,720
Two weeks later, I went to
a clinic in New Jersey.

586
00:30:19,685 --> 00:30:21,687
I told him I had a miscarriage.

587
00:30:22,221 --> 00:30:24,030
He didn't believe me.

588
00:30:25,691 --> 00:30:28,365
Do you think he told his
friends what happened?

589
00:30:28,427 --> 00:30:29,701
How could he?

590
00:30:29,895 --> 00:30:31,272
He's so pro-life.

591
00:30:33,565 --> 00:30:36,978
He tried to make me say where I
had it done, but I never would.

592
00:30:37,035 --> 00:30:39,538
Why do you think
he wanted to know?

593
00:30:40,405 --> 00:30:42,715
Well, he wanted to
get even with them.

594
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:45,814
Your wife wouldn't tell you
who performed the procedure,

595
00:30:45,877 --> 00:30:48,221
so you just shot the first
doctor you could find.

596
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:52,194
She was doing abortions
every Tuesday and Thursday.

597
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:55,527
But you didn't kill her to stop
those abortions, Mr. Jenkins,

598
00:30:55,587 --> 00:30:57,260
you killed her for revenge.

599
00:30:57,322 --> 00:30:59,859
Your justification defense
just evaporated.

600
00:31:00,325 --> 00:31:02,032
This time it was mine.

601
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:06,405
I never got to know him.

602
00:31:10,802 --> 00:31:12,975
Why isn't anybody
mourning for him?

603
00:31:16,341 --> 00:31:18,753
Give us a few minutes,
would you, please?

604
00:31:27,586 --> 00:31:30,260
He could still take the stand and
try to talk his way out of it.

605
00:31:30,322 --> 00:31:33,462
Seeley is probably in there
writing a new press release.

606
00:31:35,494 --> 00:31:36,666
We're ready.

607
00:31:37,529 --> 00:31:40,442
My client will take a plea.
Manslaughter one.

608
00:31:41,099 --> 00:31:42,305
In exchange for what?

609
00:31:42,367 --> 00:31:43,607
The guilty party.

610
00:31:44,136 --> 00:31:45,877
He didn't shoot her?

611
00:31:47,372 --> 00:31:48,646
He shot her.

612
00:31:49,274 --> 00:31:51,880
But someone else tracked her
down, gave Mr. Jenkins the gun,

613
00:31:51,943 --> 00:31:54,514
drove him to the garage,
pointed out Dr. Reed,

614
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:57,788
told him to shoot her,
then drove him away.

615
00:32:00,819 --> 00:32:01,820
I see.

616
00:32:03,955 --> 00:32:07,061
You promised Jenkins
he'd get off, but he won't.

617
00:32:08,193 --> 00:32:10,730
So now you're handing over
another fall guy.

618
00:32:12,664 --> 00:32:14,735
That's right, Mr. McCoy.

619
00:32:15,967 --> 00:32:16,968
Me.

620
00:32:24,209 --> 00:32:26,246
Seeley wanted to put
abortion on trial,

621
00:32:26,311 --> 00:32:29,155
but Jenkins' revenge motive
muddied the waters,

622
00:32:29,214 --> 00:32:31,854
so now Seeley steps up
as the ideal defendant.

623
00:32:31,917 --> 00:32:34,761
Didn't he tell the police
he had an alibi?

624
00:32:34,853 --> 00:32:38,357
Now he says he caused a ruckus
at the pro-choice conference

625
00:32:38,423 --> 00:32:40,232
but slipped away early.

626
00:32:40,292 --> 00:32:41,794
I talked to
the conference organizer.

627
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:44,500
She now says she's not
sure what time he left.

628
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:48,073
So he changes his story because
he wants his show trial.

629
00:32:48,133 --> 00:32:51,012
And our organizer lady
changes her story

630
00:32:51,069 --> 00:32:53,310
because she wants
Seeley in jail.

631
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,844
And is there anyone in town

632
00:32:56,908 --> 00:32:58,512
who is not using this office

633
00:32:58,577 --> 00:33:00,284
for their own personal agenda?

634
00:33:00,345 --> 00:33:01,517
JACK: I'm giving
Jenkins his deal.

635
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:02,923
We try Seeley for murder.

636
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:04,722
Why?
You like being used?

637
00:33:05,517 --> 00:33:08,691
Seeley is more dangerous
than a dozen Jenkinses.

638
00:33:08,887 --> 00:33:11,333
Isn't justice served by putting
them both behind bars?

639
00:33:11,389 --> 00:33:13,426
For the greater good, huh?

640
00:33:15,026 --> 00:33:17,199
Sounds like one of
Seeley's arguments

641
00:33:17,262 --> 00:33:19,970
which you are about to hear
most eloquently.

642
00:33:20,031 --> 00:33:21,772
He's representing himself.

643
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:32,120
Well-meaning people
can disagree.

644
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:38,260
Especially about the most emotionally
divisive issue to confront this country

645
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:40,127
in this century.

646
00:33:43,054 --> 00:33:44,431
Drew Seeley

647
00:33:45,424 --> 00:33:48,234
has an opinion about
abortion, too.

648
00:33:49,461 --> 00:33:52,670
He thinks his opinion
entitles him to kill people.

649
00:33:53,765 --> 00:33:57,178
He will tell you that he had a
good reason to do what he did.

650
00:33:57,736 --> 00:33:59,511
This is what he did.

651
00:34:01,072 --> 00:34:05,043
He hunted down
a woman named Eileen Reed.

652
00:34:07,145 --> 00:34:10,058
He handed
Randall Jenkins a gun.

653
00:34:11,483 --> 00:34:15,898
He told Randall Jenkins to
shoot Eileen Reed in the head,

654
00:34:18,123 --> 00:34:19,261
and he did.

655
00:34:21,126 --> 00:34:22,469
Drew Seeley

656
00:34:23,495 --> 00:34:26,442
is a self-appointed
executioner.

657
00:34:29,234 --> 00:34:31,976
If you let him get away
with it, you better pray

658
00:34:32,971 --> 00:34:36,077
that people like him don't
find some fault with you.

659
00:34:51,356 --> 00:34:55,270
A hundred and fifty years ago,
you weren't considered a person.

660
00:34:57,128 --> 00:34:58,163
Or you.

661
00:34:58,797 --> 00:34:59,798
Or you.

662
00:35:00,866 --> 00:35:03,847
A man named John Brown
thought that was wrong,

663
00:35:04,035 --> 00:35:06,208
so he took violent action

664
00:35:06,872 --> 00:35:09,011
to liberate
black American slaves.

665
00:35:11,042 --> 00:35:13,545
Well, he was arrested
and brought to trial

666
00:35:15,046 --> 00:35:17,048
because slavery was legal.

667
00:35:17,482 --> 00:35:19,985
And the law said...
The law said

668
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:24,462
that slaves were not persons
deserving of protection.

669
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:29,234
He was convicted
and he was hanged.

670
00:35:30,629 --> 00:35:32,040
But you know what?

671
00:35:33,465 --> 00:35:37,038
John Brown was right,
and the law was wrong.

672
00:35:38,837 --> 00:35:41,579
And now John Brown is
considered a hero.

673
00:35:43,608 --> 00:35:47,055
Today abortion is legal.

674
00:35:48,613 --> 00:35:50,183
But I say to you,

675
00:35:51,349 --> 00:35:54,626
that law is wrong.

676
00:35:56,388 --> 00:35:58,800
And like John Brown,
I follow...

677
00:36:01,092 --> 00:36:02,594
a higher law.

678
00:36:04,763 --> 00:36:06,208
I ask you

679
00:36:07,399 --> 00:36:08,707
to do the same.

680
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:16,080
My wife got a call.

681
00:36:16,508 --> 00:36:19,045
The man did not
identify himself.

682
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:22,387
He said he wanted to rip her
limbs out of their sockets

683
00:36:22,447 --> 00:36:25,394
just like she did
every Tuesday and Thursday.

684
00:36:28,386 --> 00:36:31,492
I call your attention to
People's Exhibit Four,

685
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:35,770
stipulated as originating
on Mr. Seeley's Xerox machine.

686
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:41,207
Do you know how this came into
your wife's possession?

687
00:36:41,266 --> 00:36:42,267
Yes.

688
00:36:42,334 --> 00:36:45,372
That was the first one she
ever got with her name on it.

689
00:36:45,437 --> 00:36:48,577
A few days before she was killed,
it was sent to her private office.

690
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,551
JACK: Did your wife try to
keep her name a secret

691
00:36:50,608 --> 00:36:52,315
from people
who opposed her activities?

692
00:36:52,377 --> 00:36:53,378
SIMON: Yes.

693
00:36:53,745 --> 00:36:56,055
Some of these people are crazy.

694
00:36:57,048 --> 00:37:00,518
She was always afraid that one
of the real nuts would find her.

695
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:02,223
Thank you.

696
00:37:04,089 --> 00:37:06,569
Dr. Reed,
your wife was upset

697
00:37:06,624 --> 00:37:10,037
to receive these
calls and letters?

698
00:37:10,095 --> 00:37:11,199
Of course.

699
00:37:11,363 --> 00:37:14,003
SEELEY: But she didn't stop
performing abortions, did she?

700
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:15,066
No.

701
00:37:15,166 --> 00:37:17,077
I told her it wasn't worth it,

702
00:37:17,335 --> 00:37:19,576
but she said she wouldn't
allow women

703
00:37:19,637 --> 00:37:22,481
to be deprived of
their right of choice

704
00:37:22,707 --> 00:37:24,709
by people threatening her life.

705
00:37:27,579 --> 00:37:28,990
Did you want her to stop?

706
00:37:29,047 --> 00:37:30,492
I wanted her alive.

707
00:37:31,149 --> 00:37:33,060
So we both tried to stop her.

708
00:37:33,318 --> 00:37:36,822
But nothing would make her
stop as long as she lived.

709
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:39,166
JACK: Objection!
You son of a bitch!

710
00:37:39,224 --> 00:37:40,567
SEELEY: Nothing further.
Mr. Seeley!

711
00:37:40,625 --> 00:37:42,002
Nothing further!

712
00:37:49,234 --> 00:37:51,942
JACK: Please tell us your
occupation, Dr. Moran.

713
00:37:52,003 --> 00:37:56,645
I'm an obstetrician, and I frequently
write and lecture on medical ethics.

714
00:37:57,275 --> 00:38:00,347
You've also been an advisor
to Mr. Seeley, haven't you?

715
00:38:00,478 --> 00:38:04,620
Some of my work has contributed to
his opposition to abortion, yes.

716
00:38:05,350 --> 00:38:09,765
Does any of your expertise in this
area derive from your own experience?

717
00:38:10,221 --> 00:38:11,222
Yes.

718
00:38:11,489 --> 00:38:14,129
I used to perform them myself

719
00:38:15,393 --> 00:38:19,398
until I awoke to the fact
that they are wrong.

720
00:38:22,867 --> 00:38:25,404
When you were
still performing them,

721
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:28,742
would Mr. Seeley have been
justified in killing you?

722
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:33,216
(SIGHS)

723
00:38:37,849 --> 00:38:38,850
Yes.

724
00:38:40,952 --> 00:38:43,865
I was, in effect,
committing murder.

725
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:49,564
In effect?

726
00:38:53,264 --> 00:38:55,710
I was committing murder.

727
00:39:00,071 --> 00:39:01,175
Fine.

728
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:07,918
Would you please stand up?

729
00:39:10,415 --> 00:39:11,951
Officer, arrest this woman.

730
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:13,290
Mr. McCoy.

731
00:39:13,418 --> 00:39:16,126
We've just heard a confession
of murder, Your Honor.

732
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:18,167
Officer...
I'm not amused, Mr. McCoy!

733
00:39:18,223 --> 00:39:20,567
How many counts of murder should
we charge you with, Dr. Moran?

734
00:39:20,625 --> 00:39:22,002
SCARLETTI: Mr. McCoy!

735
00:39:23,261 --> 00:39:25,764
May I remind you
that abortion is legal?

736
00:39:26,865 --> 00:39:28,469
Thank you, Your Honor.

737
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:38,177
"The Lord said unto Jeremiah,"

738
00:39:39,277 --> 00:39:41,655
"I knew you
when you were in the womb."

739
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:48,353
I tried to stop
the abortionists

740
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:51,958
by marching,
by sitting in, by threats.

741
00:39:52,857 --> 00:39:55,929
I even called the police
to report murders in progress.

742
00:39:56,127 --> 00:39:57,367
They laughed.

743
00:39:57,862 --> 00:40:00,775
And the death camp clinics
kept on working.

744
00:40:03,668 --> 00:40:05,238
I did the only thing

745
00:40:06,805 --> 00:40:08,910
that was left for me to do.

746
00:40:12,377 --> 00:40:15,290
I am before you
as a servant of God.

747
00:40:20,151 --> 00:40:22,062
I'm ready for your questions.

748
00:40:30,528 --> 00:40:31,802
So, Mr. Seeley,

749
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,338
you believe

750
00:40:38,303 --> 00:40:41,716
that doctors who terminate
pregnancies should be killed?

751
00:40:41,773 --> 00:40:42,877
Yes, I do.

752
00:40:42,941 --> 00:40:44,147
JACK: And your reasons
for doing this

753
00:40:44,208 --> 00:40:46,017
are grounded in the Bible?
SEELEY: Yes.

754
00:40:46,077 --> 00:40:47,715
Do you do everything
that the Bible tells you?

755
00:40:47,779 --> 00:40:49,053
I try to.

756
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:50,716
Well, do you keep slaves?

757
00:40:50,782 --> 00:40:52,853
Ephesians 6:5,

758
00:40:53,218 --> 00:40:57,360
"Slaves, obey your worldly masters
with fear and trembling."

759
00:40:57,422 --> 00:40:58,924
No, Mr. McCoy.

760
00:40:59,124 --> 00:41:01,866
The Bible simply recognizes
a practice of ancient times.

761
00:41:01,926 --> 00:41:03,530
Without condemning it.

762
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:08,410
Does the Bible
specifically condemn abortion?

763
00:41:08,833 --> 00:41:10,437
No.
JACK: No?

764
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:13,877
So, have you been
reading God's mind?

765
00:41:16,574 --> 00:41:20,647
"Rescue the weak and the
needy." Psalm 82, Verse 4.

766
00:41:20,712 --> 00:41:22,055
Is that what you do?

767
00:41:22,113 --> 00:41:23,217
Yes, I do.

768
00:41:23,548 --> 00:41:24,925
You don't rescue the weak,

769
00:41:24,983 --> 00:41:28,055
you manipulate the weak
to kill people for you.

770
00:41:28,653 --> 00:41:31,156
Randall Jenkins
followed God's word

771
00:41:31,956 --> 00:41:34,061
and performed a righteous act.

772
00:41:34,759 --> 00:41:35,760
Did he?

773
00:41:40,264 --> 00:41:41,971
If it was so righteous,

774
00:41:44,035 --> 00:41:45,981
why didn't you do it yourself?

775
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:51,081
My God-given gift

776
00:41:51,743 --> 00:41:54,349
is to organize and lead.
Oh.

777
00:41:57,048 --> 00:42:00,029
When you were drafted in the
Vietnam War, did you go?

778
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:01,519
Yes.

779
00:42:01,619 --> 00:42:04,361
As a non-combatant
conscientious objector.

780
00:42:04,422 --> 00:42:05,423
Yes.

781
00:42:06,191 --> 00:42:08,637
So that you wouldn't have to shoot
anyone, isn't that correct?

782
00:42:08,693 --> 00:42:11,196
Oh, I would have shot, if
necessary, to protect others.

783
00:42:11,262 --> 00:42:12,798
But you didn't do it.

784
00:42:12,897 --> 00:42:14,001
Well, I wasn't called upon.

785
00:42:14,065 --> 00:42:15,442
There were plenty of
other men with guns.

786
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:16,535
And then in the 1970s,

787
00:42:16,601 --> 00:42:19,172
you were active in a campaign
against capital punishment?

788
00:42:19,237 --> 00:42:21,308
Capital punishment is revenge.

789
00:42:21,906 --> 00:42:25,444
I killed Dr. Reed to prevent
deaths, not to avenge them.

790
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:27,820
You believe that killing is
wrong, don't you, Mr. Seeley?

791
00:42:27,879 --> 00:42:28,949
Of course.

792
00:42:29,013 --> 00:42:31,619
Does the Bible
specifically condemn murder?

793
00:42:31,683 --> 00:42:33,560
Yes.
"Thou shalt not kill."

794
00:42:33,751 --> 00:42:35,424
That's why I oppose abortion.

795
00:42:35,486 --> 00:42:38,729
And that's also why
you don't shoot doctors

796
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:41,134
who perform abortions.

797
00:42:41,192 --> 00:42:42,193
No.

798
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:43,500
I just told you,

799
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:47,805
others do that so that I can stay out
of jail and keep the movement alive.

800
00:42:47,865 --> 00:42:50,675
Well, but you're ready
to go to jail now.

801
00:42:51,202 --> 00:42:52,272
You never would
have been arrested

802
00:42:52,336 --> 00:42:55,283
or brought to trial
if you hadn't confessed.

803
00:42:56,874 --> 00:42:59,286
The Lord called me
to come forward.

804
00:42:59,377 --> 00:43:01,448
And it's a sin to
disobey God, isn't it?

805
00:43:01,512 --> 00:43:02,718
Yes, it is.

806
00:43:04,782 --> 00:43:06,989
Are you a sinner,
Mr. Seeley?

807
00:43:07,952 --> 00:43:10,262
I fear that all men
are sinners, Mr. McCoy.

808
00:43:10,321 --> 00:43:12,028
And what is your sin?

809
00:43:14,192 --> 00:43:15,569
This is neither the time
nor the place.

810
00:43:15,626 --> 00:43:18,800
On the contrary, this is exactly
the time and the place.

811
00:43:20,965 --> 00:43:23,605
God calls you
to organize murders,

812
00:43:23,801 --> 00:43:26,407
God calls you
to take credit for murders,

813
00:43:26,738 --> 00:43:29,617
but God never calls on you
to pull the trigger?

814
00:43:31,776 --> 00:43:33,653
Each of us has a role.

815
00:43:35,513 --> 00:43:37,254
You can't do it, can you?

816
00:43:38,850 --> 00:43:40,852
You can't bring yourself
to shoot someone,

817
00:43:40,918 --> 00:43:43,228
even though you think
God is telling you to do it,

818
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:44,664
you can't do it.

819
00:43:44,889 --> 00:43:46,698
I put the gun
in Randall's hand!

820
00:43:46,758 --> 00:43:47,930
I told him where to point it!

821
00:43:47,992 --> 00:43:50,871
You can't point a gun
at another human being,

822
00:43:50,928 --> 00:43:53,772
even an abortion doctor,
and pull the trigger,

823
00:43:53,831 --> 00:43:56,675
because in your soul
you know it's wrong!

824
00:43:56,734 --> 00:43:57,872
God says it's right!

825
00:43:57,935 --> 00:43:58,970
You don't believe that.

826
00:43:59,037 --> 00:44:00,414
I believe in the Lord my God...

827
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:01,779
Your defense is a lie!

828
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:05,548
No, what is a lie is the arrogant
belief that what you're doing here

829
00:44:05,710 --> 00:44:08,987
furthers justice! Answer
my question, Mr. Seeley.

830
00:44:15,987 --> 00:44:19,560
You are unable to
shoot doctors yourself

831
00:44:20,358 --> 00:44:22,565
because in your soul

832
00:44:22,827 --> 00:44:24,602
you know it's wrong.

833
00:44:30,835 --> 00:44:34,214
You took an oath on the Bible
to tell the truth here.

834
00:44:40,278 --> 00:44:41,552
We're waiting.

835
00:44:42,914 --> 00:44:44,723
He's badgering me, Your Honor.

836
00:44:44,782 --> 00:44:47,353
I'll instruct him to
lower the temperature,

837
00:44:47,452 --> 00:44:49,955
but you still have to
answer the question.

838
00:44:59,096 --> 00:45:00,370
We're waiting.

839
00:45:06,704 --> 00:45:08,479
If he doesn't believe
his own defense, Your Honor,

840
00:45:08,539 --> 00:45:10,212
there's no way you can
send it to the jury.

841
00:45:10,274 --> 00:45:11,878
He's right,
Mr. Seeley.

842
00:45:11,943 --> 00:45:14,253
The heart of
the justification defense

843
00:45:14,445 --> 00:45:15,924
is what you believe.

844
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:19,792
If you're not prepared to say you
believe this killing was justified,

845
00:45:20,151 --> 00:45:22,188
I cannot let the jury
consider the defense.

846
00:45:22,253 --> 00:45:24,494
I believe killing abortionists
is moral.

847
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:27,263
But you won't tell us why you
don't pull the trigger yourself.

848
00:45:27,325 --> 00:45:28,861
That is between me and my God!

849
00:45:28,926 --> 00:45:30,633
And me, Mr. Seeley.

850
00:45:31,396 --> 00:45:33,376
If you won't
answer the question,

851
00:45:33,431 --> 00:45:37,402
I will order the jury not to
consider the justification defense.

852
00:45:37,935 --> 00:45:40,211
That means you have no defense.

853
00:45:43,608 --> 00:45:47,078
If Mr. McCoy is willing to offer
you any kind of plea bargain,

854
00:45:48,212 --> 00:45:50,089
I suggest you take it.

855
00:45:55,386 --> 00:45:57,195
Seeley pleaded to murder two.

856
00:45:57,255 --> 00:45:59,565
We made it 20-to-life
instead of 25.

857
00:45:59,624 --> 00:46:01,729
One for the books, I tell you.

858
00:46:01,826 --> 00:46:04,306
Make it clear that
you can't kill anyone,

859
00:46:04,562 --> 00:46:07,236
and that's what
nails him for murder.

860
00:46:07,298 --> 00:46:09,039
It's in his own mind, too.

861
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:11,373
He felt guilty 'cause
he didn't kill the doctors.

862
00:46:11,436 --> 00:46:12,437
Yeah.

863
00:46:12,536 --> 00:46:16,382
He says God wants him to go to prison
and minister to souls in chains.

864
00:46:16,541 --> 00:46:19,351
Don't you love it
when everybody's happy?
