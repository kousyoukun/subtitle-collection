NARRATOR:
In the criminal justice system

2
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:06,647
the people are represented by two
separate yet equally important groups,

3
00:00:06,707 --> 00:00:08,653
the police
who investigate crime

4
00:00:08,709 --> 00:00:11,155
and the district attorneys
who prosecute the offenders.

5
00:00:11,211 --> 00:00:13,213
These are their stories.

6
00:00:14,348 --> 00:00:16,453
Okay. Waiting room.

7
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:20,964
Deal is anything on the floor
or in the couch, we keep.

8
00:00:21,722 --> 00:00:24,999
One time, I found a $50 bill.

9
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:29,136
My last trainee,
he told one of the doctors.

10
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:31,403
You notice
he isn't my trainee anymore.

11
00:00:31,465 --> 00:00:33,172
Got it?
Yes, sir.

12
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:36,339
You see here?

13
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:39,518
Two quarters and a dime.

14
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:43,551
Now, the doctor's office,
that's a different story.

15
00:00:43,977 --> 00:00:48,084
If you find a penny on the floor,
you vacuum around it. You got that?

16
00:00:48,148 --> 00:00:49,422
Yes, sir.

17
00:00:49,483 --> 00:00:52,396
Sanchez, I think
we're gonna get along fine.

18
00:00:54,154 --> 00:00:55,656
(GRUNTING)

19
00:00:58,125 --> 00:00:59,536
What the...

20
00:01:00,861 --> 00:01:03,637
(CHATTERING ON POLICE RADIO) The victim is a shrink.
A Dr. Lillian Hampton.

21
00:01:03,697 --> 00:01:07,042
She's on staff with the clinic. The
cleaning crew found her about 8:45.

22
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:08,272
Anybody else in the building?

23
00:01:08,335 --> 00:01:11,248
There was another cleaning crew on
the fourth floor, but that was it.

24
00:01:11,305 --> 00:01:14,013
We called the director
of the clinic, a Dr. Latham.

25
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:15,144
What about her family?

26
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:17,085
Well, Latham said
she had an ex in Westchester.

27
00:01:17,144 --> 00:01:19,454
We called, but there was no answer.
Thanks, Joe.

28
00:01:19,513 --> 00:01:22,323
Probably busy working
on his second wife.

29
00:01:24,718 --> 00:01:27,221
Somebody tried to shrink her
head the old-fashioned way.

30
00:01:27,287 --> 00:01:30,131
Three strikes, she was out. One on
the forehead, two on the left side.

31
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:31,328
We found blood on the walls.

32
00:01:31,391 --> 00:01:33,632
The perp probably ended up
wearing some.

33
00:01:33,694 --> 00:01:37,699
Cleaning crew entered the building at 8:20.
They didn't see anybody leave.

34
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:40,506
No sign of a struggle. Could've
been somebody she knew.

35
00:01:40,567 --> 00:01:44,014
Somebody who didn't want her money.
Credit cards, $40.

36
00:01:44,638 --> 00:01:47,847
Lady liked to sweat.
"Toughen-Up Gymworks."

37
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:50,683
Not tough enough.

38
00:01:50,744 --> 00:01:53,224
Detectives,
looks like our murder weapon.

39
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,090
Bits of hair and blood
on the sharp edge.

40
00:01:57,351 --> 00:01:58,386
(SIGHING)

41
00:01:58,452 --> 00:02:01,956
"With gratitude from the Coalition
of Mental Health Clinics."

42
00:02:02,022 --> 00:02:04,628
Should've given her
a plaque instead.

43
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:57,485
I'm still in shock.
It was a horrible loss.

44
00:02:57,911 --> 00:03:00,357
Lillian
was a brilliant therapist.

45
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,958
We saw the diplomas
stacked on the wall.

46
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:04,586
Lot of talent
for a free clinic.

47
00:03:04,651 --> 00:03:07,257
Well, she could have made a lot
more money in private practice,

48
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:10,324
but she preferred working here with
the schizophrenics and delusionals.

49
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:13,166
I mean, anybody our colleagues
on Park Avenue refused to take.

50
00:03:13,226 --> 00:03:14,967
What time
was her last appointment?

51
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:17,372
I have
the master schedule here.

52
00:03:20,067 --> 00:03:21,842
She had a 7:00.

53
00:03:21,902 --> 00:03:24,849
With who? Client records
are confidential.

54
00:03:25,072 --> 00:03:28,281
We just need the name, Doc,
not the whole work-up.

55
00:03:28,909 --> 00:03:30,411
Megan Nelson.

56
00:03:30,477 --> 00:03:34,425
But I believe Dr. Hampton had somebody
else in the office after her.

57
00:03:34,481 --> 00:03:36,017
Why would you believe that?

58
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:38,927
Well, when I left a little after
8:00, I heard a man in there.

59
00:03:38,985 --> 00:03:41,022
It was a very intense session.

60
00:03:41,088 --> 00:03:43,591
He was yelling something like,
"How could you do that?"

61
00:03:43,657 --> 00:03:45,500
Someone's yelling,
you don't check it out?

62
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:47,732
We hear a lot of that
in the clinic.

63
00:03:47,794 --> 00:03:50,775
Well, if he was in the waiting
room, maybe Megan Nelson saw him.

64
00:03:50,831 --> 00:03:53,471
You know where we can find her?
Yeah.

65
00:03:59,773 --> 00:04:01,719
This is very upsetting.

66
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,689
Dr. Hampton
was everything to me.

67
00:04:06,313 --> 00:04:08,987
A year ago,
I couldn't get out of bed,

68
00:04:09,049 --> 00:04:11,393
forget about
holding down a job.

69
00:04:17,824 --> 00:04:19,770
She gave me a new life.

70
00:04:21,228 --> 00:04:23,834
We're very,
very sorry for your loss.

71
00:04:25,899 --> 00:04:28,743
Yesterday,
you were her last appointment.

72
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:31,872
What time did you leave?

73
00:04:32,305 --> 00:04:34,080
It was 7:50.

74
00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:38,052
Dr. Hampton's very strict
about the 50-minute hour.

75
00:04:38,545 --> 00:04:41,458
That was good for me.
The structure, I mean.

76
00:04:41,815 --> 00:04:44,887
So, now, as you were leaving, did
you see anybody in the waiting room

77
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:47,431
or maybe hanging around
downstairs?

78
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:51,333
No. I was in a hurry to get to work.
I don't like to be late.

79
00:04:52,359 --> 00:04:53,804
Try to remember, Megan.

80
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:57,137
We're thinking there might have
been a man waiting to see her.

81
00:04:57,197 --> 00:04:58,540
A man?

82
00:04:59,499 --> 00:05:02,343
There's Julio.
He works in the parking lot.

83
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:07,810
And there was a man in a green car.
He pulled in to park.

84
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:10,614
You remember anything
about this man?

85
00:05:10,877 --> 00:05:13,050
He honked his horn at Julio.

86
00:05:13,346 --> 00:05:15,383
He seemed very impatient.

87
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:19,562
That's all I remember.

88
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:23,162
The jerk in the green Jag?
Yeah, he was here.

89
00:05:23,223 --> 00:05:25,829
Honked at me 'cause I didn't
take his money quick enough.

90
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:28,202
He drove in and parked in the
corner, like he always does.

91
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:29,365
Is he a regular?

92
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:30,874
He's been here a few times.

93
00:05:30,931 --> 00:05:34,140
So, what's he do after he parks,
break out a deck of cars?

94
00:05:34,201 --> 00:05:37,375
Usually the drill is Dr. Hampton
comes down to talk to him.

95
00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:39,246
So, who is this guy,
the boyfriend?

96
00:05:39,306 --> 00:05:40,546
Hey, none of my business.

97
00:05:40,607 --> 00:05:42,609
Last night,
any change in the drill?

98
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:44,917
I don't know. I left at
8:00, before she came down.

99
00:05:44,978 --> 00:05:46,855
Well, while you were
minding your business,

100
00:05:46,913 --> 00:05:49,416
did you happen to notice
anything else about this guy?

101
00:05:49,482 --> 00:05:51,257
Like height, weight,
color of hair?

102
00:05:51,318 --> 00:05:54,663
Salt-and-pepper hair. Polo shirt.
You know, the golfing type.

103
00:05:54,721 --> 00:05:57,998
He has a sticker on the visor.
Crestmont Club.

104
00:05:58,058 --> 00:05:59,537
Okay, thanks.

105
00:06:00,894 --> 00:06:03,067
Crestmont.
It's up in Westchester.

106
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:05,405
I got 5 bucks
that says it's the ex.

107
00:06:05,465 --> 00:06:07,604
They got a couple of nice
par fives there.

108
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:09,943
Wonder how hard
he swings his driver?

109
00:06:13,473 --> 00:06:17,080
Yeah, I was there last night. About 10 minutes.
I never left the car.

110
00:06:17,143 --> 00:06:19,953
Why not? Do you like
the smell of exhaust?

111
00:06:20,013 --> 00:06:23,722
I don't like psychodramas in the
middle of a skid-row outhouse.

112
00:06:23,783 --> 00:06:26,821
I take it you don't approve
of your wife's job.

113
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:30,960
Pro bono psychiatry. Lillian thought
she was doing something good.

114
00:06:31,024 --> 00:06:32,469
Maybe she was.

115
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:36,029
Which brings us back to what you
were doing there, Dr. Hampton.

116
00:06:36,096 --> 00:06:38,940
I was doing penance for
missing two alimony payments.

117
00:06:38,999 --> 00:06:41,172
Now I bring
the checks in person.

118
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:42,804
$10,000.

119
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:45,884
When she didn't come down
to get it, I left.

120
00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:48,442
You never called up?
Why should I?

121
00:06:48,775 --> 00:06:52,222
And no disrespect, but I jumped
through enough hoops for her.

122
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:55,419
Well, right now, it's only your
word that you never went upstairs.

123
00:06:55,482 --> 00:06:58,861
I was on my cell phone to my
girlfriend the whole time.

124
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:01,866
I was still talking to her
when I drove out.

125
00:07:02,489 --> 00:07:04,526
She has a very nice voice.

126
00:07:07,327 --> 00:07:09,170
Must've been a lovely marriage.

127
00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:12,767
A guy like that, she should have
been paying him to stay away.

128
00:07:12,832 --> 00:07:15,278
You talk to his girlfriend?
Yeah.

129
00:07:15,735 --> 00:07:18,909
She is Becky Price.

130
00:07:18,972 --> 00:07:21,111
She does have a nice voice.

131
00:07:21,174 --> 00:07:22,585
IUDs confirmed
they were on the phone.

132
00:07:22,642 --> 00:07:25,020
Twenty minutes later they were
sitting at the River Cafe.

133
00:07:25,078 --> 00:07:26,148
Doesn't give him much time

134
00:07:26,212 --> 00:07:29,056
to smack his wife around and then
get the blood off his golf shirt.

135
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:30,651
Well, we know
about the girlfriend.

136
00:07:30,717 --> 00:07:33,391
What about Dr. Hampton?
Any man in her life?

137
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:36,593
Yeah, but his name's Fluffy,
and he's been neutered.

138
00:07:36,656 --> 00:07:39,967
Other than that, her social
calendar's pretty light.

139
00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:42,063
Hey, look, if it's a choice
between work and play,

140
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:43,835
my bet is the work killed her.

141
00:07:43,897 --> 00:07:45,501
(SIGHS) Yeah, but without
the patient records,

142
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:48,512
we have no way of knowing which
kernel was getting ready to pop.

143
00:07:48,568 --> 00:07:50,946
Could be it's popped before
and got arrested.

144
00:07:51,004 --> 00:07:54,315
Let's wait and see if Latent
comes back with prints.

145
00:07:55,008 --> 00:07:56,783
(HORNS HONKING)

146
00:07:58,511 --> 00:07:59,922
What are you smiling about?

147
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:02,426
We got hits
on two sets of prints.

148
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:03,893
Paul White, felonious assault,

149
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:06,021
and Edward Brennig,
attacked a police officer.

150
00:08:06,086 --> 00:08:09,363
My kind of guy. Either one of them
leave a print on the murder weapon?

151
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:10,526
It was wiped clean.

152
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:13,594
So, which one of the mentally challenged
do you want to talk to first?

153
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,662
Brennig or White?
Oh, Brennig.

154
00:08:15,729 --> 00:08:19,302
Let's see if he's changed his
opinion of police officers.

155
00:08:21,434 --> 00:08:23,004
Edward Brennig?

156
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:25,839
Nice badge. What do you want?

157
00:08:25,905 --> 00:08:28,749
For starters,
you could put the can down.

158
00:08:30,377 --> 00:08:32,015
Any other tricks
I can do for you?

159
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:33,853
Yeah, instant recall.

160
00:08:33,913 --> 00:08:36,951
Last Tuesday night,
between 7:00 and 8:30.

161
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:39,258
I was home, watching Court TV.

162
00:08:39,886 --> 00:08:42,765
Picking up pointers for the
next time you beat up a cop?

163
00:08:42,822 --> 00:08:44,392
Come on, give me a break,
all right?

164
00:08:44,457 --> 00:08:47,165
I got into a bar fight.
I didn't mean to hit the cop.

165
00:08:47,227 --> 00:08:49,264
I love cops.
Yeah, it shows.

166
00:08:49,329 --> 00:08:52,833
Maybe you can tell us why we found
your prints at the Amsterdam Clinic.

167
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:55,209
What'd I do, forget to
vacuum underneath the couch?

168
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:57,578
Vacuuming?
Is that part of your therapy?

169
00:08:57,637 --> 00:09:01,312
Therapy? Hey, I ain't one of
those fruit loops, all right?

170
00:09:01,608 --> 00:09:05,078
The company that cleans the place,
they hire me when they're shorthanded.

171
00:09:05,145 --> 00:09:07,989
Last time was two weeks ago.

172
00:09:08,515 --> 00:09:10,153
We straight now?

173
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:13,430
Do I look like the type
to hit somebody?

174
00:09:13,486 --> 00:09:15,966
As a matter of fact,
Mr. White, you do.

175
00:09:16,022 --> 00:09:19,993
I just pushed the dude. I didn't
like the way he was looking at Alex.

176
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,267
Well, fill us in. Who's Alex?

177
00:09:22,762 --> 00:09:24,002
My cat.

178
00:09:25,865 --> 00:09:28,277
Dr. Hampton
at the Amsterdam Clinic,

179
00:09:28,334 --> 00:09:30,439
I heard she looked
at Alex funny, too.

180
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:32,210
Alex and her don't get along.

181
00:09:32,272 --> 00:09:34,878
So, you did see her recently.
Maybe it was Tuesday night.

182
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:38,855
No, that was the night
I got my prescription adjusted

183
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:42,852
at the outpatient pharmacy,
Bellevue Hospital.

184
00:09:45,785 --> 00:09:49,028
Well, I see it says Tuesday,
but it doesn't say what time.

185
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:51,899
Oh, well,
I was there all night waiting.

186
00:09:52,025 --> 00:09:55,029
They're not very organized there.
Alex was very upset with them.

187
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:57,405
Alex was upset
with Dr. Hampton, too, huh?

188
00:09:57,464 --> 00:10:01,002
Yeah, yeah. That's why I called her
and left a message on her machine

189
00:10:01,067 --> 00:10:03,240
to say I wasn't coming back.

190
00:10:03,303 --> 00:10:04,543
Sounds good to us.

191
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,982
Meantime, why don't you
come on down to the precinct?

192
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,314
We'll get you a nice hot meal.

193
00:10:08,374 --> 00:10:10,945
You got something for Alex?
Oh, sure, sure.

194
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:13,513
As long as he likes
day-old donuts.

195
00:10:15,315 --> 00:10:17,420
Well,
nix on the donuts for Alex.

196
00:10:17,484 --> 00:10:19,327
Bologna was a big hit, though.

197
00:10:19,385 --> 00:10:21,661
Yeah, well, nix on
Mr. White as our suspect.

198
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:23,530
Bellevue remembers him
and Alex.

199
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:26,264
The orderly's
got the scratches to prove it.

200
00:10:26,326 --> 00:10:29,432
White said he left a message
on Hampton's machine.

201
00:10:29,496 --> 00:10:33,137
I didn't see a machine in her office,
so it must have been voice mail.

202
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:36,373
Okay. Now, our guy
isn't in the appointment book.

203
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:40,174
Suppose he needed an emergency
tune-up from Dr. Hampton.

204
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,982
He calls late, leaves a message.
Bingo.

205
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:47,458
WOMAN: Hi, Dr. Hampton.
It's Miss Schwab.

206
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:49,555
Another woman. Next.

207
00:10:52,552 --> 00:10:54,327
MAN:
Lillian, it's Dr. Morris.

208
00:10:54,387 --> 00:10:58,631
I have the speech sketched out for
the association. I'm faxing it over.

(SIGHING)

211
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:04,907
Hey, Mike, when we get to some
heavy breathing, I'll wake you up.

212
00:11:04,964 --> 00:11:07,604
WOMAN: Hi, Dr. Hampton. It's
Jeanine at the Vertical Club.

213
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:10,705
Just confirming
your personal workout session.

214
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:12,909
Hey, wait a minute. Go back.

215
00:11:12,972 --> 00:11:14,212
(TAPE REWINDING)

216
00:11:14,274 --> 00:11:17,551
Hi, Dr. Hampton. It's Jeanine
at the Vertical Club.

217
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:21,220
Wasn't that gym bag in Hampton's
office from someplace else?

218
00:11:21,281 --> 00:11:22,919
Yeah. Toughen-Up something.

219
00:11:22,982 --> 00:11:25,519
You have the inventory
from the bag?

220
00:11:29,322 --> 00:11:30,733
Here we go.

221
00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:34,764
Sweatshirt, sweatpants,
socks, swipe card. No name.

222
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:37,665
Check with the club
and get a name.

223
00:11:38,565 --> 00:11:40,101
BRISCOE:
We've got a swipe card.

224
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:43,943
This isn't the Y. Our members
expect a little privacy.

225
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:47,447
Well, this member may have
crushed a woman's skull.

226
00:11:48,241 --> 00:11:50,744
Please don't make us
get a warrant.

227
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:52,756
Okay. Give me the card.

228
00:11:55,315 --> 00:11:56,658
In case you're interested,

229
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:59,060
we got a two-years-for-the-price-of-one
special going.

230
00:11:59,118 --> 00:12:01,291
You ought to think about that,
Mike.

231
00:12:01,354 --> 00:12:03,766
I'm definitely
thinking about it.

232
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:05,997
Here he is. Bobby Walker.

233
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:08,562
He lives at 49-A
Horatio Street.

(BABY CRYING)

235

Detectives, I guess you have
some more questions for me.

236
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:25,883
Are you roommates
with Bobby Walker?

237
00:12:25,945 --> 00:12:27,322
Not really.

238
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:31,226
Well, was Walker not really with you
at Dr. Hampton's the other night?

239
00:12:31,284 --> 00:12:32,957
That's impossible.

240
00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:41,202
MAN: Keep it down.

241
00:12:43,062 --> 00:12:44,769
Okay, where is he?

242
00:12:45,832 --> 00:12:47,743
He's not here right now.

243
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,508
We can see that.
Where can we find him?

244
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:54,411
He's in here. I'm Bobby.

245
00:13:03,683 --> 00:13:04,855
Megan,

246
00:13:06,419 --> 00:13:09,263
how long are we gonna have to
sit here listening to you say

247
00:13:09,322 --> 00:13:11,563
that you're a guy named Bobby?

248
00:13:12,325 --> 00:13:14,566
You think I'm making this up?

249
00:13:15,428 --> 00:13:19,570
I think you have
a very unique imagination.

250
00:13:20,667 --> 00:13:24,171
Bobby. Is that some kind
of nickname for Roberta?

251
00:13:25,405 --> 00:13:27,078
No, Bobby is a he.

252
00:13:27,407 --> 00:13:29,409
He's who I am sometimes.

253
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:34,053
Dr. Hampton diagnosed me with
Multiple Personality Disorder.

254
00:13:34,514 --> 00:13:37,222
Okay. I'm gonna play along.

255
00:13:38,418 --> 00:13:41,228
Now, tell me what Bob
did last night.

256
00:13:41,554 --> 00:13:42,794
I can't.

257
00:13:43,456 --> 00:13:46,460
When I switch, I don't remember
what the last alter did.

258
00:13:46,526 --> 00:13:47,698
Alter?

259
00:13:48,061 --> 00:13:49,904
Alternate personalities.

260
00:13:49,963 --> 00:13:53,809
I have two of them, not including me.
There's Bobby and Nancy.

261
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:57,072
Dr. Hampton was helping me
integrate them.

262
00:13:57,136 --> 00:13:59,980
Okay, can we talk to Bobby?

263
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:02,383
It's not like
I can turn a dial.

264
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:07,590
Believe me, if Bobby did something
terrible, I want to help you.

265
00:14:07,647 --> 00:14:09,923
Why don't you tell us
what you do remember?

266
00:14:09,983 --> 00:14:13,760
Now, you said you left Dr. Hampton's
office just before 8:00.

267
00:14:15,054 --> 00:14:17,591
Yes. I remember
being in the office.

268
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:21,164
And then I saw the clock
in the lobby.

269
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:26,677
This is very stressful.
You're not kidding.

270
00:14:34,941 --> 00:14:38,445
She got a Multiple Personality
Disorder diagnosis from her doctor?

271
00:14:38,511 --> 00:14:41,492
That's what she says. This
only happens on Oprah, right?

272
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:44,391
It's a diagnosis that's
caused a lot of controversy.

273
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:47,329
Some doctors say that it's
caused by a childhood trauma.

274
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:49,492
Others say
that it's caused by ideas

275
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:52,126
planted in the mind of the
patient by the therapist.

276
00:14:52,191 --> 00:14:54,899
Oh, the therapist tells her
she's crazy, so she acts crazy.

277
00:14:54,961 --> 00:14:59,034
She's not acting. Give her a lie detector.
Chances are she'd pass.

278
00:14:59,098 --> 00:15:02,170
She says she blanks when this
Bobby personality comes out.

279
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:03,578
That's probably true.

280
00:15:03,636 --> 00:15:06,583
Unless the different personalities
are communicating with each other,

281
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,880
she wouldn't have any memory
of what each one's doing.

282
00:15:08,941 --> 00:15:11,285
Well, do these personalities
talk to each other?

283
00:15:11,344 --> 00:15:14,052
There are therapists who have
their patients keep a journal,

284
00:15:14,113 --> 00:15:17,060
so that each personality can write
their thoughts during the switch.

285
00:15:17,116 --> 00:15:20,097
That way, they can leave
notes for each other.

286
00:15:20,153 --> 00:15:23,066
Yeah, fat chance Megan's just
gonna hand us her journal.

287
00:15:23,122 --> 00:15:26,228
Well, we know we don't have enough
to get a warrant to look for it.

288
00:15:26,292 --> 00:15:29,364
She said she went straight to
work from Hampton's office.

289
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:31,102
Yeah, Miss Punctuality.

290
00:15:31,164 --> 00:15:33,007
With all that blood spatter
at the scene,

291
00:15:33,065 --> 00:15:35,636
some of Hampton's blood
must've gotten on her clothes.

292
00:15:35,701 --> 00:15:38,511
What'd she do, run through a
car wash on her way to work?

293
00:15:38,571 --> 00:15:40,847
Megan's been working here
nearly a year.

294
00:15:40,907 --> 00:15:43,183
Always on time,
keeps the orders straight.

295
00:15:43,242 --> 00:15:46,451
Best of all, she doesn't burn up
the phone with personal business.

296
00:15:46,512 --> 00:15:48,856
When she came in on Tuesday,
how did she seem?

297
00:15:48,915 --> 00:15:51,395
She seemed okay.
Far as that goes for her.

298
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:53,795
Meaning sometimes
she wasn't okay?

299
00:15:53,853 --> 00:15:56,424
Well, some days
she wants to be called Bobby.

300
00:15:56,489 --> 00:15:58,400
Other days, it's Nancy.

301
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:02,167
All the same to me. Whatever
the name, she does great work.

302
00:16:02,228 --> 00:16:05,641
So, Tuesday, did you notice
anything unusual about her clothes?

303
00:16:05,698 --> 00:16:08,076
No. Coat and a dress.

304
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:11,638
She say anything? Yeah, she
said "sorry" a million times.

305
00:16:11,704 --> 00:16:13,877
She was late.
Not normal for her.

306
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,385
Among other things.

307
00:16:15,441 --> 00:16:17,250
So, how late was she?

308
00:16:23,049 --> 00:16:26,622
She punched in at 8:52.
Excuse me.

309
00:16:29,188 --> 00:16:33,000
Clinic's 15 minutes away.
That leaves about 45 minutes.

310
00:16:33,926 --> 00:16:37,032
Sounds like probable cause
to search her place.

311
00:16:38,898 --> 00:16:42,004
I'd like to know
which personality's into this.

312
00:16:42,068 --> 00:16:45,311
That would be Nancy. She's a
personal favorite of mine.

313
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:46,577
I bet.

314
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:50,882
Your boss know you could be
charging for two roommates?

315
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:53,719
Hey, Miss Nelson, she pays her
rent on time. She's quiet.

316
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:55,224
Why should I make
trouble for her?

317
00:16:55,281 --> 00:16:57,727
Hey, Mike, look at this.

318
00:16:59,218 --> 00:17:00,754
Computer disks.

319
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:03,562
Look at the titles.
"Megan. Nancy. Bobby."

320
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:05,665
Let's put Bobby in.

321
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:15,479
Looks like some kind of diary.
Yeah. We'll get it printed up.

322
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:18,311
So, what is it she did, anyway?

323
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:20,282
We don't know
if she did anything.

324
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:23,445
You see her last Tuesday night?
No, I didn't.

325
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:26,149
You ever talk to her
when she calls herself Bobby?

326
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:28,590
Bobby, now,
he's a piece of work.

327
00:17:28,648 --> 00:17:31,595
He chewed up that bunch upstairs
for playing the music too loud.

328
00:17:31,651 --> 00:17:33,153
Anybody ever complain
about her?

329
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:35,392
No, like I said before,
she was quiet.

330
00:17:35,454 --> 00:17:36,956
Except when her father
came around.

331
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:39,367
They had a couple of blowouts
right out here.

332
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:42,133
You happen to hear
the topic of conversation?

333
00:17:42,195 --> 00:17:44,175
Yeah. She said
he was harassing her,

334
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:46,938
and if I ever saw him around the
building, I should call the cops.

335
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:49,741
She had a restraining order
against him.

336
00:17:54,841 --> 00:17:56,752
It was all
her therapist's idea.

337
00:17:56,809 --> 00:17:59,346
She thought I was interfering
with Megan's progress.

338
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:00,447
And were you?

339
00:18:00,513 --> 00:18:03,983
I was trying to keep my daughter from
going completely off the deep end,

340
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:06,894
which is where Dr. Hampton
was sending her.

341
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:10,530
Well, no offense, but it looks
to me like she's already there.

342
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:14,231
My wife died when Megan was three.
I raised her by myself.

343
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:16,631
Granted, she was troubled.

344
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:20,369
Then a year ago,
she saw Dr. Hampton.

345
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:22,640
All of a sudden,
she was three troubled people.

346
00:18:22,702 --> 00:18:25,683
I couldn't figure out
what the hell was going on.

347
00:18:25,738 --> 00:18:27,718
That must've been
pretty tough to live with.

348
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:30,617
I could have managed,
but Hampton insisted

349
00:18:30,676 --> 00:18:33,782
that Megan needed to move out
and be on her own.

350
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:36,958
At first,
I went along with that.

351
00:18:37,016 --> 00:18:40,088
Then Megan refused to see me.
She wouldn't take my calls.

352
00:18:40,152 --> 00:18:43,190
Another one of the doctor's ideas?
That's right.

353
00:18:43,256 --> 00:18:45,236
She was controlling
my daughter.

354
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:47,931
Using her to prove
some quack theory.

355
00:18:48,828 --> 00:18:51,365
Megan was holding down a job,
paying her rent.

356
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:53,307
Sounds like a solid citizen
to me.

357
00:18:53,366 --> 00:18:55,346
Minimum wage, plus tips?

358
00:18:55,835 --> 00:18:58,907
A dump in the West Village?
That is not a life.

359
00:18:59,672 --> 00:19:01,982
Did you ever discuss your
feelings with Dr. Hampton?

360
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:04,385
I discussed them
with her answering service.

361
00:19:04,443 --> 00:19:06,980
She refused to talk to me
about it.

362
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:09,315
Megan's a complicated kid.

363
00:19:09,382 --> 00:19:12,022
Raising her by himself
can't be that easy.

364
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:15,224
Yeah? Well, I don't buy
that father-knows-best routine

365
00:19:15,288 --> 00:19:16,995
that Nelson gave us last night.

366
00:19:17,056 --> 00:19:19,161
Especially with
some doctor butting in.

367
00:19:19,225 --> 00:19:21,535
Hey, when I was drinking,
my kid had a therapist

368
00:19:21,594 --> 00:19:23,801
who kept telling her
what a lousy father I was.

369
00:19:23,863 --> 00:19:26,867
I didn't like the message, but I
never thought about killing him.

370
00:19:26,933 --> 00:19:30,676
Your kid didn't get a restraining
order against you, Lennie.

371
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:33,283
Why don't you find out
why Megan did?

372
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:35,751
I'll see if they got
her diaries printed out.

373
00:19:35,808 --> 00:19:37,185
All right.

374
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:40,086
Bobby's diary,
the day before the murder.

375
00:19:40,146 --> 00:19:43,559
"Nancy left a note for me.
She called me a liar."

376
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:45,896
"That bitch
better watch herself."

377
00:19:45,952 --> 00:19:47,727
Sounds like a nice guy.

378
00:19:47,787 --> 00:19:49,266
Nancy's diary.

379
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:51,426
"I can't trust Bobby or Megan."

380
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:55,165
"They promise to clean the kitchen,
and they don't. I hate liars."

381
00:19:55,227 --> 00:19:56,968
Sounds like
one big happy family.

382
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:59,532
Got the court records
on the restraining order.

383
00:19:59,598 --> 00:20:01,134
The judge issued two
the same day.

384
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,202
One to keep Mr. Nelson
away from his daughter,

385
00:20:03,269 --> 00:20:05,806
and another to keep him away
from Dr. Hampton.

386
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:08,044
Why? Because he harassed
her voice mail?

387
00:20:08,107 --> 00:20:11,452
Turns out he faced off with her a
couple of times outside the clinic.

388
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:13,717
I'm with Nancy. I hate liars.

389
00:20:14,146 --> 00:20:16,217
Hey,
it gets worse for Mr. Nelson.

390
00:20:16,282 --> 00:20:18,819
Here, in Bobby's diary,
the day of.

391
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,625
"I gotta make sure
Megan remembers"

392
00:20:20,686 --> 00:20:23,997
"her old man has to be
at the appointment tonight."

393
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:26,431
Let's see if Megan remembered.

394
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,402
Here we go.

395
00:20:28,461 --> 00:20:31,271
"I talked to Dad.
He promises he'll be there."

396
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:35,403
"I'm worried, but Dr. Hampton says
it's necessary for him to come."

397
00:20:36,035 --> 00:20:38,072
Okay, so, if Nelson was there,

398
00:20:38,137 --> 00:20:42,415
the screaming that the clinic director
heard could have been him, right?

399
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:49,492
Okay, Dr. Latham, tell us if you
recognize any of these voices.

400
00:20:55,121 --> 00:20:56,930
Number one, go ahead.

401
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:59,000
How could you do that?

402
00:21:01,127 --> 00:21:03,664
Number two.
How could you do that?

403
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:09,071
Number three.
How could you do that?

404
00:21:10,202 --> 00:21:12,204
Could he say that louder?

405
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:16,720
Number three,
say that again louder, please.

406
00:21:17,042 --> 00:21:18,919
How could you do that?

407
00:21:20,813 --> 00:21:23,350
That's him.
Thank you, Dr. Latham.

408
00:21:25,551 --> 00:21:27,963
Well, that's a positive ID.
Of what?

409
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:31,661
A booming voice, originally
heard through a hardwood door?

410
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:35,803
Excuse me while I share
a good laugh with my client.

411
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:45,973
If it's not enough to hold him, is it
enough to get us into his apartment?

412
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:47,949
To find what?
Well, for openers,

413
00:21:48,007 --> 00:21:51,819
how about some of Hampton's blood
on one of his Armani suits?

414
00:21:51,877 --> 00:21:55,882
I'll talk to Judge Walters. He
should be back from lunch by now.

415
00:21:57,717 --> 00:22:00,459
My second wife always wanted
a walk-in closet.

416
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:03,625
Now I finally got one.
Trouble is, I live in it.

417
00:22:03,689 --> 00:22:05,999
I got something in the kitchen.

418
00:22:10,129 --> 00:22:13,474
The luminol brought up trace
blood smudges around the sink.

419
00:22:13,532 --> 00:22:16,741
There's two, each less than
five millimeters wide.

420
00:22:17,403 --> 00:22:20,907
All right, is that enough to run a match?
No problem.

421
00:22:32,718 --> 00:22:33,753
Mr. Nelson.

422
00:22:33,819 --> 00:22:35,765
Excuse me, gentlemen,
I'm on a call to China.

423
00:22:35,821 --> 00:22:37,323
You're gonna wish
you were in China.

424
00:22:37,389 --> 00:22:40,529
Frank Nelson, you're under arrest for
the murder of Dr. Lillian Hampton.

425
00:22:40,593 --> 00:22:42,095
You have the right
to remain silent.

426
00:22:42,161 --> 00:22:45,199
Anything you do say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

427
00:22:45,264 --> 00:22:47,471
You understand? You have
the right to an attorney.

428
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:52,975
Trace amounts of Jo.-negative?

429
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:55,314
By the time I'm finished
with your blood evidence,

430
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:58,378
I'll have the jurors convinced
it was their blood you found.

431
00:22:58,444 --> 00:23:00,981
The fact is,
it's Dr. Hampton's blood.

432
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:03,048
His daughter's diaries
place him at the scene.

433
00:23:03,115 --> 00:23:04,958
He was heard screaming
at Dr. Hampton.

434
00:23:05,017 --> 00:23:07,463
He was heard
raising his voice, period.

435
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,522
You have this all wrong.

436
00:23:09,688 --> 00:23:11,827
I had no reason to kill her.

437
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:14,804
She was worried enough about you
to get a restraining order.

438
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:18,865
She didn't want to be accountable for
what she was doing to my daughter.

439
00:23:18,931 --> 00:23:20,604
And you care so much
for your daughter

440
00:23:20,666 --> 00:23:23,647
that you'd kill anyone who
got between you, is that it?

441
00:23:23,702 --> 00:23:26,182
You don't believe him,
then talk to his daughter.

442
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:29,549
They left together, and
Dr. Hampton was still alive.

443
00:23:33,646 --> 00:23:36,786
I remember
leaving with my father.

444
00:23:37,716 --> 00:23:39,889
Dr. Hampton was still alive.

445
00:23:41,754 --> 00:23:45,395
Then why didn't you tell the
police your father was there?

446
00:23:48,227 --> 00:23:49,900
I guess I forgot.

447
00:23:50,462 --> 00:23:53,068
We read in your diary
that you were worried

448
00:23:53,132 --> 00:23:55,874
about what might happen
at that session.

449
00:23:56,669 --> 00:23:57,739
Why?

450
00:24:00,306 --> 00:24:03,116
I don't remember
what happened in session.

451
00:24:04,009 --> 00:24:07,081
Anyway, I don't have to tell you
anything that happens in therapy.

452
00:24:07,146 --> 00:24:09,319
That's private.
You do,

453
00:24:09,882 --> 00:24:14,160
if you expect me to believe that
your father didn't kill Dr. Hampton.

454
00:24:16,055 --> 00:24:19,264
I'm not feeling very well.
I think you should go.

455
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:28,445
First she avoids him
like the plague.

456
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:31,606
Now she's lying to protect him.
Doesn't make a lot of sense.

457
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:33,581
It does if she's scared of him.

458
00:24:33,639 --> 00:24:36,313
I didn't get the feeling
that she was.

459
00:24:36,442 --> 00:24:38,479
She seemed more confused
than anything.

460
00:24:38,544 --> 00:24:41,525
With three personalities
at the wheel, who wouldn't be?

461
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:44,823
Maybe the one who's running
scared is Frank Nelson.

462
00:24:44,883 --> 00:24:47,227
He interfered with her therapy.

463
00:24:47,286 --> 00:24:49,027
Could be he felt threatened.

464
00:24:49,088 --> 00:24:50,396
I went through her diaries.

465
00:24:50,456 --> 00:24:54,302
As far as churning up family secrets,
the sessions seemed pretty tame.

466
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:58,672
The juicy stuff would be locked
up in Hampton's medical records.

467
00:24:58,964 --> 00:25:01,808
Which you can't get to
without her consent.

468
00:25:02,468 --> 00:25:04,573
Was Hampton
her first therapist?

469
00:25:04,637 --> 00:25:07,413
According to her father, she has
a history of mental illness.

470
00:25:07,473 --> 00:25:10,454
But no one's volunteered the
names of the other therapists.

471
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:13,285
Until she moved out, her
father was paying her bills.

472
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:15,154
Including the medical ones.

473
00:25:15,214 --> 00:25:17,956
Subpoena his bank records
and get a name.

474
00:25:21,854 --> 00:25:24,630
Megan had already been through Freud
and Jung, with little result.

475
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:26,601
Well, you think your therapy
was more effective?

476
00:25:26,659 --> 00:25:28,161
More flexible.

477
00:25:29,228 --> 00:25:32,437
I use talk therapy,
rebirthing, hypnosis.

478
00:25:33,299 --> 00:25:35,939
Whatever works
for the particular patient.

479
00:25:36,001 --> 00:25:37,878
What worked for Megan?

480
00:25:38,704 --> 00:25:41,116
You know I can't get into
that with you.

481
00:25:41,173 --> 00:25:44,484
All I will say is she had
trouble with the therapy.

482
00:25:44,677 --> 00:25:45,951
Meaning?

483
00:25:46,011 --> 00:25:48,924
She had a bad session, and
then she just stopped coming.

484
00:25:48,981 --> 00:25:50,722
Did you find out why?

485
00:25:50,783 --> 00:25:53,491
I called her, but I only
spoke with her father.

486
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:56,192
He said she'd decided
to stop therapy.

487
00:25:56,455 --> 00:25:59,993
Do you think he had anything
to do with why she stopped?

488
00:26:00,492 --> 00:26:03,837
He just told me he wanted her
file sent to a Dr. Coleman.

489
00:26:03,896 --> 00:26:07,309
Well, Mr. Nelson is the one
who retained my services

490
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:11,313
after he spent an hour
grilling me on my credentials.

491
00:26:11,537 --> 00:26:13,210
What did he want?

492
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:15,682
Oh, anything that worked.

493
00:26:15,741 --> 00:26:19,382
But it had to be conservative treatment.
No New Age therapies.

494
00:26:19,445 --> 00:26:21,857
I fit the bill,
so he sent Megan here.

495
00:26:21,914 --> 00:26:25,225
At that time, did she have
these multiple personalities?

496
00:26:25,284 --> 00:26:28,663
No. I don't subscribe
to that kind of diagnosis.

497
00:26:28,721 --> 00:26:31,702
Megan had one
very borderline personality.

498
00:26:31,757 --> 00:26:34,203
We worked on it
once a week for two years.

499
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:36,398
I take it she wasn't cured?

500
00:26:37,062 --> 00:26:40,202
We came close to a breakthrough.
Then Megan backed away.

501
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:42,711
She decided to stop coming?
Yes.

502
00:26:43,068 --> 00:26:47,141
Sometimes dredging up a painful
memory can be too difficult to face,

503
00:26:47,206 --> 00:26:49,482
even when a patient
wants the therapy to work.

504
00:26:49,541 --> 00:26:53,614
This painful memory, did it have
something to do with Frank Nelson?

505
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:57,252
Even if I were free to tell
you, I don't know what it is.

506
00:26:57,616 --> 00:27:01,655
But, yes, I believe it does have
something to do with her father.

507
00:27:02,187 --> 00:27:03,825
A painful memory?

508
00:27:03,889 --> 00:27:05,664
What are we talking about,
child abuse?

509
00:27:05,724 --> 00:27:06,896
They wouldn't say.

510
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:10,566
I spoke to four doctors. I got four
versions of patient privilege.

511
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:14,270
All they would say was Megan's the one
who pulled the plug on the therapy.

512
00:27:14,333 --> 00:27:16,609
This time it was Frank Nelson.

513
00:27:16,669 --> 00:27:19,707
One doctor suggested he was
the cause of her trauma.

514
00:27:20,205 --> 00:27:24,483
But unless Megan confirms it or
hands over her medical records,

515
00:27:24,543 --> 00:27:27,183
that's as much
as we're going to know.

516
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:29,955
Maybe we could force her hand.

517
00:27:31,283 --> 00:27:34,127
She's providing
her father with an alibi.

518
00:27:34,419 --> 00:27:37,298
We could turn that
into a charge of conspiracy.

519
00:27:37,356 --> 00:27:39,996
How does that
get us her records?

520
00:27:40,058 --> 00:27:44,131
Her lawyer has a client with
Multiple Personality Disorder.

521
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:47,640
What defense does that suggest?

522
00:27:47,699 --> 00:27:49,736
An insanity plea.
Right.

523
00:27:50,002 --> 00:27:53,142
She puts her mental state at
issue, she waives privilege

524
00:27:53,205 --> 00:27:56,015
and has to hand over
her medical records.

525
00:27:56,575 --> 00:27:58,282
Let's pick her up.

526
00:27:59,445 --> 00:28:00,822
Two of you?

527
00:28:00,913 --> 00:28:03,052
We're getting something to go.

528
00:28:03,115 --> 00:28:06,255
Sorry, folks, we're going
to need your waitress.

529
00:28:06,919 --> 00:28:09,832
Megan Nelson, you're under arrest
for conspiracy to commit murder.

530
00:28:09,888 --> 00:28:11,333
You have the right
to remain silent.

531
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:15,202
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

532
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:16,830
Nice technique, McCoy.

533
00:28:16,895 --> 00:28:20,206
Squeeze my client's head hard enough,
maybe her memory'll come back.

534
00:28:20,265 --> 00:28:22,506
Well, it seems to come and go.

535
00:28:22,835 --> 00:28:24,439
She forgets
her father was there.

536
00:28:24,503 --> 00:28:26,176
She remembers Dr. Hampton
was alive.

537
00:28:26,238 --> 00:28:27,740
She forgets
what they talked about.

538
00:28:27,806 --> 00:28:31,948
She has Multiple Personality Disorder.
She can't help it. She blanks out.

539
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:33,921
And we're supposed to
take her word for it?

540
00:28:33,979 --> 00:28:35,686
Claire, you're going to have
a hard enough time

541
00:28:35,747 --> 00:28:39,126
proving the underlying crime,
let alone a conspiracy.

542
00:28:39,184 --> 00:28:43,132
And from what I hear, your case against
Frank Nelson is far from made.

543
00:28:43,188 --> 00:28:45,930
I'll make it when I put her
on trial with her father.

544
00:28:45,991 --> 00:28:47,698
Given her psychiatric history,

545
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:50,933
don't you think a trial
would be a waste of time?

546
00:28:53,665 --> 00:28:56,646
Well, send her
medical records to our expert.

547
00:28:56,702 --> 00:28:59,410
If she thinks she's insane,
we'll talk.

548
00:29:02,007 --> 00:29:04,146
Here. February 22nd.

549
00:29:04,376 --> 00:29:06,982
Hampton reports that Megan
has a recurring vision

550
00:29:07,045 --> 00:29:09,286
of her father standing
at the top of the stairs,

551
00:29:09,348 --> 00:29:12,158
quote "looking down at her
like a giant."

552
00:29:12,217 --> 00:29:14,163
A memory of child abuse?

553
00:29:14,219 --> 00:29:16,631
No. This isn't about
child abuse.

554
00:29:17,155 --> 00:29:19,328
A couple of weeks later,
Hampton wrote

555
00:29:19,391 --> 00:29:22,201
that the Nancy personality
was urging Megan

556
00:29:22,261 --> 00:29:25,174
to tell the truth
about her mother's death.

557
00:29:25,464 --> 00:29:28,741
And then this,
a week before she was killed.

558
00:29:29,334 --> 00:29:30,972
"A painful session."

559
00:29:31,036 --> 00:29:33,141
"Megan struggled, resisted."

560
00:29:33,372 --> 00:29:35,511
"Finally,
the memory became clear."

561
00:29:35,574 --> 00:29:38,714
"She's three years old.
She's in her bedroom."

562
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:40,723
"She hears her parents argue."

563
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:43,589
"She runs out of her room.
She hears a scream."

564
00:29:43,915 --> 00:29:47,328
"She sees her father push her
mother down the stairs."

565
00:29:47,386 --> 00:29:50,856
"She sees her mother lying
at the bottom, not moving."

566
00:29:52,257 --> 00:29:54,168
She witnessed
her mother's murder.

567
00:29:54,226 --> 00:29:56,570
At the very least,
she thinks she did.

568
00:29:56,628 --> 00:30:00,542
And they dropped the bomb on
Mr. Nelson during the last session.

569
00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:04,672
According to Dr. Hampton's notes,
that's what they intended to do.

570
00:30:04,736 --> 00:30:07,046
So, two people
knew what he did.

571
00:30:07,239 --> 00:30:10,777
One's dead, and the other
can be dismissed as a lunatic.

572
00:30:11,443 --> 00:30:14,720
See what records you can find
on her mother's death.

573
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:16,987
I was the fourth officer
on the scene.

574
00:30:17,049 --> 00:30:19,222
Carol Nelson
was on the bottom landing.

575
00:30:19,284 --> 00:30:21,890
She'd gone ass-over-teakettle
down two flights of stairs.

576
00:30:21,953 --> 00:30:23,762
Any indication
she got a little help?

577
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:26,393
Yeah, from a half quart
of 18-year-old Scotch.

578
00:30:26,458 --> 00:30:30,099
Mrs. Nelson was one of the more
colorful characters on the beat.

579
00:30:30,162 --> 00:30:31,800
So, she had a drinking problem.

580
00:30:31,863 --> 00:30:34,707
Lovely lady. I mean,
really a very happy drunk.

581
00:30:34,766 --> 00:30:39,044
She liked to sing show tunes in her
skivvies from her bedroom window.

582
00:30:39,438 --> 00:30:43,409
Mr. Nelson must've loved that.
Well, I heard they had arguments.

583
00:30:43,475 --> 00:30:45,250
Was he there
the night she died?

584
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:47,756
He was home,
best I can remember.

585
00:30:47,946 --> 00:30:50,950
I wasn't the investigating officer.
Who was?

586
00:30:51,016 --> 00:30:53,428
Arnie Wallace,
God rest his soul.

587
00:30:57,456 --> 00:31:00,801
Fall in the home resulting in
accidental death. A hat trick.

588
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:04,705
Could've been filed under accidental,
homeowners, or through the life policy.

589
00:31:04,763 --> 00:31:07,141
I'll need a year and name
of the insured.

590
00:31:07,199 --> 00:31:09,577
1977. Carol Nelson.

591
00:31:17,342 --> 00:31:19,413
Here you go. Carol Nelson.

592
00:31:20,078 --> 00:31:22,581
$500,000 payout
on the life policy.

593
00:31:23,348 --> 00:31:25,521
What was the cause of death?

594
00:31:26,418 --> 00:31:28,056
Accidental fall.

595
00:31:28,854 --> 00:31:31,061
Blood alcohol level was 0.18.

596
00:31:32,224 --> 00:31:33,999
Is that all there is?

597
00:31:34,059 --> 00:31:38,132
Once the claim is paid, we wait five
years, then we purge the files.

598
00:31:38,196 --> 00:31:42,611
Adjuster's reports, witness statements,
medicals, they're all destroyed.

599
00:31:44,536 --> 00:31:47,346
I pulled the files from the
police and the insurance company.

600
00:31:47,406 --> 00:31:49,682
The death was ruled accidental.

601
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:52,381
Based on what?
Frank Nelson's say-so?

602
00:31:52,444 --> 00:31:53,479
Who knows?

603
00:31:53,545 --> 00:31:56,321
The police filled in the right
boxes then dumped their reports.

604
00:31:56,381 --> 00:31:59,362
The insurance company cleans out
their files every five years.

605
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:00,623
Thumbnail version,

606
00:32:00,686 --> 00:32:04,634
Carol Nelson had a blood alcohol of 0.18.
She tripped and fell.

607
00:32:05,023 --> 00:32:08,004
"My wife's drunk.
She slipped on the stairs."

608
00:32:08,427 --> 00:32:10,703
Haven't you heard that before?

609
00:32:11,963 --> 00:32:16,173
SELIG: By now, I'm sure your expert
agrees my client was legally insane.

610
00:32:16,234 --> 00:32:18,737
Your client's sanity
isn't relevant at this point.

611
00:32:18,804 --> 00:32:22,115
I've dismissed the charges
against her without prejudice.

612
00:32:22,174 --> 00:32:24,484
I'm waiting for the other shoe.

613
00:32:26,378 --> 00:32:29,222
I want her to testify
against her father.

614
00:32:31,683 --> 00:32:33,993
I've read your medical records.

615
00:32:34,386 --> 00:32:37,196
I know why your father
killed Dr. Hampton.

616
00:32:37,923 --> 00:32:40,335
I want to know
why you are protecting the man

617
00:32:40,392 --> 00:32:42,303
who killed your mother.

618
00:32:42,527 --> 00:32:45,007
That's what you believe,
isn't it?

619
00:32:45,564 --> 00:32:48,067
I happen to believe it,
too, Megan.

620
00:32:49,267 --> 00:32:52,510
You want to know what really
happened, you ask me!

621
00:32:55,707 --> 00:32:57,880
Who am I talking to?
Bobby.

622
00:32:58,443 --> 00:32:59,820
I'm Bobby.

623
00:33:01,346 --> 00:33:04,452
You were there?
Yeah, I was there all right.

624
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:08,263
Tell me what happened.
It's all Dr. Hampton's fault.

625
00:33:09,855 --> 00:33:12,927
Did Frank Nelson kill Dr. Hampton?
No.

626
00:33:13,925 --> 00:33:17,998
Hampton was trying to get rid of me.
She wanted me to leave Megan.

627
00:33:19,264 --> 00:33:22,370
She didn't give me a choice.
I had to kill her.

628
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:36,989
It's the father. It's the daughter.
It's Bobby.

629
00:33:37,048 --> 00:33:39,528
You need a scorecard
to keep track.

630
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:41,928
This confession sound
right to you? No.

631
00:33:41,987 --> 00:33:44,092
Male personalities
are protectors.

632
00:33:44,155 --> 00:33:47,295
If Bobby's taking the rap,
he's trying to protect Megan.

633
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:49,635
From what?
A fate worse than prison?

634
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:54,268
Maybe he's trying to protect her from
having to testify against her father.

635
00:33:54,332 --> 00:33:57,472
That'd make sense
if her father threatened her.

636
00:33:57,803 --> 00:34:00,010
So, Bobby gives her a way out.

637
00:34:01,406 --> 00:34:03,352
(PHONE BUZZING)

638
00:34:05,844 --> 00:34:06,948
Yes?

639
00:34:08,413 --> 00:34:09,653
Thanks.

640
00:34:10,549 --> 00:34:13,120
Nelson's attorney.
He wants to meet.

641
00:34:13,518 --> 00:34:15,225
Of course he does.

642
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:20,225
Satisfied, Jack? My client
did not kill Dr. Hampton.

643
00:34:20,458 --> 00:34:22,495
Really? Did he kill his wife?

644
00:34:22,561 --> 00:34:24,472
I did not kill my wife.

645
00:34:24,529 --> 00:34:26,304
Megan saw you do it.

646
00:34:26,364 --> 00:34:28,640
Dr. Hampton
uncovered the memory.

647
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:31,340
Talk to the police.
Read the reports.

648
00:34:31,403 --> 00:34:33,542
We tried to.
There's nothing left.

649
00:34:33,605 --> 00:34:37,849
I'll tell you the same thing I told
Megan and that therapist of hers.

650
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:39,820
Talk to my wife's sister
in Poughkeepsie.

651
00:34:39,878 --> 00:34:42,256
She was there.
She saw what happened.

652
00:34:42,314 --> 00:34:46,057
Fine. You're saying
what Megan remembers is false.

653
00:34:46,117 --> 00:34:47,960
Of course it's false.

654
00:34:48,653 --> 00:34:51,634
I told Megan
her mother was a drunk.

655
00:34:53,191 --> 00:34:56,468
I am the only one who ever
cared about my daughter.

656
00:34:57,229 --> 00:34:59,436
Seems to me
you just lost your motive.

657
00:34:59,531 --> 00:35:03,536
On the contrary. Dr. Hampton
convinced Megan you were a killer.

658
00:35:04,202 --> 00:35:06,944
Would it make you any less
angry that it was a lie?

659
00:35:07,005 --> 00:35:09,007
You try explaining that
to the jury.

660
00:35:09,074 --> 00:35:11,577
I'll settle
for Bobby's confession.

661
00:35:12,511 --> 00:35:14,548
Bobby isn't competent
to testify.

662
00:35:14,613 --> 00:35:17,719
You don't think so?
File a motion.

663
00:35:20,385 --> 00:35:23,525
Multiple personalities?
Switching?

664
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:28,631
Forget competency, Mr. Weaver. Are
you sure your witness is even sane?

665
00:35:28,693 --> 00:35:30,639
It makes no difference, Judge.

666
00:35:30,695 --> 00:35:32,538
In Barker v. Washburn,

667
00:35:32,597 --> 00:35:37,444
even if the witness is legally
insane, if they understand the oath

668
00:35:37,502 --> 00:35:41,245
and can give a correct account of
what happened, they can testify.

669
00:35:41,306 --> 00:35:44,378
That only begs the question, who
are they calling as a witness?

670
00:35:44,442 --> 00:35:48,822
Megan, who may be insane, or Bobby,
a figment of her imagination?

671
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,554
It makes no difference that
Bobby confessed to the crime?

672
00:35:51,616 --> 00:35:53,527
What matters
is that Bobby doesn't exist.

673
00:35:53,585 --> 00:35:57,897
Our expert can establish that Bobby
can form and remember impressions

674
00:35:57,956 --> 00:35:59,765
and can talk about them
intelligently.

675
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:02,100
That is the standard
for competency.

676
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:05,698
Mr. McCoy, isn't the only issue
here one of credibility?

677
00:36:06,498 --> 00:36:09,775
It would be like asking a jury to
judge the credibility of a Martian.

678
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:11,211
It's beyond their experience.

679
00:36:11,269 --> 00:36:14,614
That's why we have experts. Who I
want to hear from in the morning

680
00:36:14,673 --> 00:36:18,746
before I decide if I'm going to
turn this witness loose on a jury.

681
00:36:21,847 --> 00:36:24,157
DR. OLIVET: When Megan takes
on the persona of Bobby,

682
00:36:24,215 --> 00:36:26,525
she's in an altered
mental state.

683
00:36:26,584 --> 00:36:30,054
She uses it as a crutch to
cope with the outside world.

684
00:36:30,121 --> 00:36:32,692
JACK: So, in your opinion,
Bobby doesn't exist?

685
00:36:32,757 --> 00:36:34,964
Bobby is a distorted reflection

686
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:38,064
of Megan's inner feelings,
memories, fears.

687
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:40,376
The fact that she's
given him a name

688
00:36:40,432 --> 00:36:42,434
doesn't make him any more real.

689
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:46,175
And would Bobby's testimony
be reliable? No.

690
00:36:46,237 --> 00:36:49,912
Like testimony derived through
hypnosis or truth serum,

691
00:36:49,975 --> 00:36:53,013
it's elicited from
a hyper-suggestible state.

692
00:36:54,813 --> 00:36:56,190
Thank you.

693
00:36:56,982 --> 00:37:01,431
When Megan switches, she's not
suddenly rendered unconscious, is she?

694
00:37:01,686 --> 00:37:02,892
No.
No.

695
00:37:02,954 --> 00:37:05,059
Megan just takes on
a new identity,

696
00:37:05,123 --> 00:37:07,933
which can walk and talk
like anyone else.

697
00:37:07,992 --> 00:37:09,562
That's correct.

698
00:37:09,628 --> 00:37:13,337
So, Bobby could go
to the movies, drive a car,

699
00:37:13,398 --> 00:37:15,071
or even commit a crime.

700
00:37:15,133 --> 00:37:17,613
But it would be Megan
doing all those things.

701
00:37:17,669 --> 00:37:19,410
She just believes it's Bobby.

702
00:37:19,471 --> 00:37:24,079
But there's no reason why Bobby couldn't
tell us about it, is there, Doctor?

703
00:37:24,843 --> 00:37:26,345
In theory, no.

704
00:37:27,946 --> 00:37:31,325
Bobby comes out during
the dissociative process.

705
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:35,955
He takes both physical and
psychological control of Megan's body.

706
00:37:36,021 --> 00:37:38,831
Is Bobby aware
of what's happening to him?

707
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:40,961
Bobby is just like any of us,

708
00:37:41,026 --> 00:37:44,030
a functioning person
with all of his faculties.

709
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:46,302
Bobby has a memory?
Oh, yes.

710
00:37:46,731 --> 00:37:48,733
And if we could
bring Bobby out,

711
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,644
he'd be able to convey
those memories to us.

712
00:37:51,703 --> 00:37:53,944
Certainly.
Thank you, Doctor.

713
00:37:56,074 --> 00:37:59,954
Would you characterize Bobby
as a protector personality?

714
00:38:00,912 --> 00:38:05,486
Well, that's the typical role of the
male personality in the female patient.

715
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:08,759
If Megan can't handle the stress
of a particular situation,

716
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:11,061
Bobby does the coping for her.

717
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:12,260
Yes.

718
00:38:12,324 --> 00:38:15,533
Bobby would do whatever
it took to protect Megan.

719
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:18,804
That's his role,
as long as it helps Megan.

720
00:38:20,465 --> 00:38:23,309
So, he would even lie for her,
wouldn't he?

721
00:38:25,704 --> 00:38:27,445
I suppose he might.

722
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:32,552
In your opinion, Doctor, can
Bobby be brought out on command?

723
00:38:32,811 --> 00:38:34,950
Switching can be triggered.

724
00:38:35,013 --> 00:38:36,856
Mr. McCoy
inadvertently did it.

725
00:38:36,915 --> 00:38:40,385
I believe we could,
using a comparable stimulus.

726
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:44,066
If you think you can bring
Bobby out, Dr. Cantrel,

727
00:38:44,122 --> 00:38:46,329
then I want to hear from him.

728
00:38:49,527 --> 00:38:54,203
You know, Megan, Mr. McCoy thinks
you're trying to protect your father,

729
00:38:54,699 --> 00:38:56,940
a man who killed your mother.

730
00:38:57,435 --> 00:38:59,210
I told him I'm not.

731
00:38:59,537 --> 00:39:03,314
Well, he says you're afraid to
tell us what really happened.

732
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:07,018
I can't.

733
00:39:07,078 --> 00:39:08,614
Come on, Megan.

734
00:39:09,114 --> 00:39:11,594
What are you afraid of,
the truth?

735
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:14,452
Or is it something else?

736
00:39:15,553 --> 00:39:18,796
Come on, Megan, admit it.
It's all an act, isn't it?

737
00:39:18,857 --> 00:39:20,700
There is no Bobby.
There is no Nancy.

738
00:39:20,759 --> 00:39:24,297
You're just hiding behind them
so we'll feel sorry for you.

739
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:28,640
So you can lie and do whatever you
want, and you won't be responsible.

740
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:31,613
Why don't you just
leave her the hell alone?

741
00:39:33,738 --> 00:39:36,651
Is that you, Bobby?
Who does it look like?

742
00:39:44,349 --> 00:39:46,886
I understand
you killed Dr. Hampton.

743
00:39:47,152 --> 00:39:48,859
Is that true?
Yeah.

744
00:39:50,155 --> 00:39:53,136
Like I told them,
Dr. Hampton wanted me gone.

745
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:55,701
She didn't understand
how much Megan needs me.

746
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,296
And that's why you killed her?

747
00:39:57,362 --> 00:39:59,968
I'm the only one
who sticks by Megan.

748
00:40:02,667 --> 00:40:06,410
Tell me what happened, Bobby.
How did you kill Dr. Hampton?

749
00:40:08,606 --> 00:40:10,745
It's just me and that bitch.

750
00:40:11,442 --> 00:40:16,118
She's rocking back and forth in her
chair, chewing on a pencil. So smug.

751
00:40:16,981 --> 00:40:19,962
Telling me I'm bad for Megan.
What about her?

752
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:23,766
What did you do, Bobby?

753
00:40:25,824 --> 00:40:27,633
That's when I did it.

754
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:32,169
I pounded her in the head.
I had to.

755
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:35,404
It was either me or her.

756
00:40:41,039 --> 00:40:42,484
Thank you, Bobby.

757
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:45,146
I have one question
for the witness, Your Honor.

758
00:40:45,210 --> 00:40:46,985
Go ahead, Mr. McCoy.

759
00:40:47,412 --> 00:40:51,758
You said you struck Dr. Hampton
while she was seated at her desk.

760
00:40:52,517 --> 00:40:55,657
Is that correct?
That's how it happened, yeah.

761
00:40:57,789 --> 00:40:59,166
Thank you.

762
00:41:02,193 --> 00:41:03,501
The witness is lying.

763
00:41:03,561 --> 00:41:07,168
If that's what you think, you have the
opportunity to cross-examine at trial.

764
00:41:07,232 --> 00:41:10,441
Dr. Hampton was struck while she was
standing at the door of her office,

765
00:41:10,501 --> 00:41:11,536
not at her desk.

766
00:41:11,603 --> 00:41:13,947
Bobby didn't know that
because Bobby didn't kill her.

767
00:41:14,005 --> 00:41:16,781
Then how does Bobby know
so many details of the crime?

768
00:41:16,841 --> 00:41:19,788
Maybe Bobby read the paper,
but not the case file.

769
00:41:19,844 --> 00:41:23,485
As a matter of law, Bobby can't
testify because he wasn't there.

770
00:41:23,548 --> 00:41:25,960
I have to agree with Mr. McCoy.
Judge.

771
00:41:26,017 --> 00:41:29,863
If I allow this witness to
testify, I'd be suborning perjury.

772
00:41:30,355 --> 00:41:31,993
That's my ruling.

773
00:41:32,223 --> 00:41:34,464
I'm not letting Bobby testify.

774
00:41:35,226 --> 00:41:38,799
I give Weaver an hour before
he calls looking for a deal.

775
00:41:39,764 --> 00:41:41,835
What, it's not good enough?

776
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:43,504
We proved Bobby wasn't there.

777
00:41:43,568 --> 00:41:46,242
What's bothering me is,
why wasn't he?

778
00:41:47,138 --> 00:41:49,982
Megan has a restraining order
against her father.

779
00:41:50,041 --> 00:41:53,454
They're having a confrontation
about him killing her mother.

780
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:56,048
It escalates
to the point of murder.

781
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:58,521
Where's Bobby, her protector?

782
00:41:59,784 --> 00:42:03,027
Maybe her psyche's not as
fine-tuned as a Ferrari.

783
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:07,564
We assumed that Nelson
was furious at the doctor

784
00:42:07,625 --> 00:42:10,231
for convincing Megan
he was a killer.

785
00:42:10,962 --> 00:42:13,636
But suppose Megan
believed her father?

786
00:42:15,833 --> 00:42:18,814
Then he'd have no reason
to kill Dr. Hampton.

787
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:21,107
What changed Megan's mind?

788
00:42:21,172 --> 00:42:24,745
He told her to check out her story.
What was it he said?

789
00:42:25,610 --> 00:42:28,454
Call the mother's sister
in Poughkeepsie.

790
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:31,621
Oh, that was a long time ago.

791
00:42:33,051 --> 00:42:35,053
Things were bad
between Frank and my sister.

792
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:37,156
I mean, Carol was thinking
about moving out.

793
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:39,497
That's why I was there
that night.

794
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:42,197
Was Frank ever violent with her?
No.

795
00:42:42,994 --> 00:42:44,769
I mean, they argued,

796
00:42:45,863 --> 00:42:48,503
slammed a few doors,
but that was it.

797
00:42:48,866 --> 00:42:51,745
Megan was just a little
three-year-old caught in the middle.

798
00:42:51,803 --> 00:42:55,012
It's understandable
why she thought he killed her.

799
00:42:55,373 --> 00:42:59,583
Megan called. She was so upset.
I mean, crying, you know.

800
00:43:00,078 --> 00:43:03,025
I kept, you know, reassuring
her that I'd been there.

801
00:43:03,081 --> 00:43:05,584
That Frank did not
kill her mother.

802
00:43:05,984 --> 00:43:08,624
And she believed you?
Yeah.

803
00:43:08,686 --> 00:43:12,498
I thought it would make her happy,
but she seemed even more upset.

804
00:43:12,557 --> 00:43:15,766
She said she had to find
her father and apologize.

805
00:43:15,827 --> 00:43:18,364
Where was her father?
I don't know.

806
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:20,932
Oh, she was
in her doctor's office.

807
00:43:22,066 --> 00:43:24,774
Said she had to go
and find him.

808
00:43:29,374 --> 00:43:33,254
I see. Now you're saying
the father didn't do it.

809
00:43:34,379 --> 00:43:37,121
You ought to take this roller
coaster to Coney Island.

810
00:43:37,181 --> 00:43:38,592
The sister confirms it.

811
00:43:38,650 --> 00:43:42,928
Now we know Frank Nelson left Hampton's
office while she was still alive.

812
00:43:42,987 --> 00:43:46,059
Maybe this Bobby
confession is for real.

813
00:43:46,658 --> 00:43:49,434
We proved that personality
wasn't there.

814
00:43:50,028 --> 00:43:52,975
In other words, you have no
idea who committed this crime.

815
00:43:53,031 --> 00:43:54,772
It has to be Megan.

816
00:43:54,832 --> 00:43:57,540
She was seeing Hampton
for over a year.

817
00:43:57,602 --> 00:44:00,515
Do you have a motive?
Megan's unstable.

818
00:44:01,139 --> 00:44:03,983
I'm not sure she knows
she did it, let alone why.

819
00:44:04,042 --> 00:44:05,316
Find out.

820
00:44:06,878 --> 00:44:09,586
We know you were alone
with Dr. Hampton.

821
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:13,356
That leaves only one person who
could have killed her. You.

822
00:44:15,987 --> 00:44:18,263
JACK: We'd like to see you
get some help, Miss Nelson,

823
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:20,768
but you have to tell us
the truth.

824
00:44:20,825 --> 00:44:23,032
I told you, I don't remember.

825
00:44:27,965 --> 00:44:30,912
How about you, Mr. Nelson?
How's your memory?

826
00:44:31,002 --> 00:44:34,814
CLAIRE: She must have gone to your condo.
That's how the blood got there.

827
00:44:34,872 --> 00:44:38,479
Frank, don't say anything.

828
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:41,957
No one can protect you
anymore, Miss Nelson.

829
00:44:42,013 --> 00:44:44,118
Not your father. Not Bobby.

830
00:44:47,985 --> 00:44:49,760
Now, tell us what happened.

831
00:44:49,821 --> 00:44:51,596
I can't tell you
what I don't know.

832
00:44:51,656 --> 00:44:53,966
Jack, please,
the girl needs help.

833
00:44:54,025 --> 00:44:56,130
Come on, Megan, talk to me.

834
00:44:57,428 --> 00:44:58,930
No more lies.

835
00:45:01,232 --> 00:45:02,609
I'm a liar?

836
00:45:04,101 --> 00:45:06,138
You're calling me a liar?

837
00:45:06,838 --> 00:45:08,784
She's the one who lied.

838
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:14,014
Who lied, Megan?

839
00:45:14,912 --> 00:45:16,892
Leave Megan out of this.

840
00:45:17,515 --> 00:45:19,358
You're talking to me.

841
00:45:19,751 --> 00:45:21,628
And nobody lies to me.

842
00:45:22,453 --> 00:45:24,626
Including that idiot doctor.

843
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:28,192
What did Dr. Hampton do?

844
00:45:30,028 --> 00:45:32,304
She thought she could fool me.

845
00:45:32,697 --> 00:45:34,699
Said she made a mistake.

846
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:38,071
Maybe Frank
didn't kill Megan's mom.

847
00:45:38,469 --> 00:45:40,608
Did she think I was stupid?

848
00:45:41,272 --> 00:45:43,946
What she meant was
she lied to Megan.

849
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:46,449
Megan trusted her.

850
00:45:50,915 --> 00:45:52,690
And you killed her?

851
00:45:54,152 --> 00:45:56,655
Yes. Me.

852
00:46:00,558 --> 00:46:02,231
What's your name?

853
00:46:03,227 --> 00:46:04,433
Nancy.

854
00:46:06,297 --> 00:46:09,107
I saw that stupid award
she's so proud of.

855
00:46:10,134 --> 00:46:12,375
She didn't deserve any awards.

856
00:46:13,437 --> 00:46:16,941
So I gave it to her
with gratitude.

857
00:46:32,823 --> 00:46:35,736
If we ever need to justify
letting people plead insanity,

858
00:46:35,793 --> 00:46:37,500
Megan Nelson fits the bill.

859
00:46:37,562 --> 00:46:39,940
So, she goes into the hospital
as three people,

860
00:46:39,997 --> 00:46:42,341
and we hope that she
comes back out as one.

861
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:45,574
And regardless, her father
will be there waiting.
