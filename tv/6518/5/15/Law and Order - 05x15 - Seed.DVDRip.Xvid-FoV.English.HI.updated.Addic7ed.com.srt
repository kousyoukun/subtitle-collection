I told you, Susan. He's not in.
SUSAN: Do I look stupid?

7
00:00:17,284 --> 00:00:19,230
He told you to say
he's not in.

I've got work to do.
I'll tell Mr. Parker...

You'll tell him
to get his ass out here. Now.

Do I have to call security?

I assume
he's told you the big news.

Please calm down. I don't need
to get in the middle of this.

16
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,684
He killed my baby,
and he's taking a hike!

That's a hell of a boss
you've got!

00:00:50,117 --> 00:00:52,654
I will scream!

00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:57,660
I want the world to know
all about my darling husband!

Tell all these people!

00:01:16,977 --> 00:01:20,447

I was a little jealous.

I guess she wasn't
trying to scare him.

She had a miscarriage.

She said you had something
to do with that.

63
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:57,647
Sure, it was my fault.

64

It was also your fault
and the mailman's

Yeah, well, you're the one
she took the shot at.

Isn't it obvious
my wife wasn't rational?

I thought about leaving her
for months.

The DA okay with that?

74
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:31,808
It's pretty hard to argue
with 30 eyewitnesses.

75
00:04:31,872 --> 00:04:34,751
This lady goes into a bank,
waves a .38 around.

76
00:04:34,808 --> 00:04:36,788
Actually took a shot
at the husband.

77
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:38,823
He all right?
Yeah, he's a little shook up,

78
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:40,085
but he'll get over it

79
00:04:40,147 --> 00:04:43,151
when he realizes how much money
he's saving on attorney's fees.

80

He was divorcing her.

81

What's this
about killing her baby?

82

She had a miscarriage.

83
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,263
Husband said she blamed
the whole world for it.

84
00:04:49,322 --> 00:04:52,303
Yeah, well, it appears she
was a little more specific.

85
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:55,000
So what?
So, a middle-class woman

00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:57,905
starts taking potshots
in a midtown bank.

something more here.

I mean, she's dead.

89

Well, call me curious.

90
00:05:02,903 --> 00:05:05,509
I'd like to know what put her
in a position to get that way.

91
00:05:05,572 --> 00:05:06,880
Talk to the ME.

92
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:09,113
Talk to him about what?
Yeah.

93
00:05:09,176 --> 00:05:10,712
She said he killed her baby.

94
00:05:10,777 --> 00:05:14,054
Maybe she was saner than her
husband would have us believe.

95
00:05:14,714 --> 00:05:17,388
I told you on the phone I haven't
completed the full autopsy.

96
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:18,895
But you did do a prelim.

97

Cause of death,
.38 in the back. You happy?

98
00:05:21,421 --> 00:05:22,900
What about bruises?

99
00:05:22,956 --> 00:05:25,129
Those bank floors are hard.
I wouldn't be surprised.

100
00:05:25,192 --> 00:05:27,433
Well, we're thinking maybe there
were some that were caused

101
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:28,837

I already told you
my wife had a miscarriage.

108
00:05:57,557 --> 00:06:00,367
Maybe I should
get my attorney over here.

109
00:06:00,427 --> 00:06:01,565
Do you think you need one?

110

How should I know?
Look what happened.

113
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:12,709
My wife wasn't exactly rational.
Yeah,

114
00:06:12,772 --> 00:06:14,945
and Grandma always said
a smack in the head

115
00:06:15,008 --> 00:06:17,420

the more desperate she got.

120
00:06:31,925 --> 00:06:33,734

said that you killed her baby.

The ME found bruises
on your wife's body.

128
00:06:54,314 --> 00:06:57,056
So, tell us what it's about,
Mr. Parker.

129
00:07:00,553 --> 00:07:02,829
Let me tell you about my wife.

130
00:07:03,323 --> 00:07:05,997
She was crazy ever since
she got on the baby kick.

full of hormones every week.

It didn't exactly help
her mental health.

134
00:07:11,865 --> 00:07:16,007
Did you get impatient with her?
Maybe give her a little incentive?

After the miscarriage,

136

Susan was
totally out of control.

137
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:26,657
I tried to comfort her, be with her.
I mean, it was my baby, you know.

138
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:31,187
But all she wanted to do was start again
with Gilbert and the hormone shots.

139
00:07:31,251 --> 00:07:33,322
I couldn't live like that
anymore. Nobody could.

140
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:34,456
And you moved out?

141
00:07:34,521 --> 00:07:37,092
Yeah, I started packing,
and she attacked me.

142
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:42,603
I lost my temper, but I swear
all I did was push her away.

taking those shots for a long time.

152
00:08:10,724 --> 00:08:12,965
Maybe this isn't the first
time he lost his temper.

00:08:25,105 --> 00:08:28,575
to send birth announcements
and baby pictures.

158
00:08:29,275 --> 00:08:32,688
The Parkers' baby would have
been on this wall right here.

159
00:08:34,748 --> 00:08:36,489
About Susan Parker, Doctor.

160
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:38,961
The last time you saw her...
It happens.

161
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:41,431
Excuse me?
The miscarriage.

162
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:45,602
She came in panicked about two weeks ago.
She was bleeding.

163
00:08:45,725 --> 00:08:47,966
There was nothing I could do.

164
00:08:49,129 --> 00:08:50,836
Susan didn't take it
very well.

165
00:08:50,897 --> 00:08:52,274
Well, that's understandable.

166
00:08:52,332 --> 00:08:54,642
Susan had a tendency
to overreact.

167
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:56,078
The treatments didn't help.

168
00:08:56,136 --> 00:08:58,116
You talking about
the hormones?

169
00:08:58,171 --> 00:09:00,913
It aids in conception, yes.

170
00:09:02,642 --> 00:09:04,178
My heart really
went out to her.

171
00:09:04,244 --> 00:09:07,623
She kept screaming,
telling me I was wrong.

172
00:09:08,114 --> 00:09:10,321
Unfortunately, I wasn't wrong.
It's traumatic,

173
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:13,796
but it would have been much
worse later in the pregnancy.

174
00:09:13,987 --> 00:09:15,694
Susan was only
eight and a half weeks.

175
00:09:15,755 --> 00:09:18,201
Do you know exactly
what caused the miscarriage?

176
00:09:18,258 --> 00:09:19,635
It's hard to say.

177
00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:22,502
She was too emotional
for a complete exam.

178
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:26,605
It could have been many things. My
patients are typically high-risk.

179
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:28,976
LOGAN: You saw her
once a week, right?

180
00:09:29,469 --> 00:09:32,575
Did you notice any bruises that
shouldn't have been there?

181
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:34,414
What are you saying?

182
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:37,081
You think her husband beat her up?
Brandon?

183
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:40,056
Yes, there were problems
in the marriage, but abuse?

184
00:09:40,113 --> 00:09:41,251
Susan would've told me.

185
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:43,157
Well, maybe she wasn't
all that proud of it.

186
00:09:43,216 --> 00:09:47,187
The women who come to me
want to get pregnant.

187
00:09:47,487 --> 00:09:50,764
I'm the last resort.
I know everything about them.

188
00:09:50,824 --> 00:09:53,566
When and what they eat,
how much they sleep,

189
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:55,799
what kind of nail polish
they use.

190
00:09:56,029 --> 00:09:57,269
Is that important?

191
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:59,139
Everything is important

192
00:09:59,199 --> 00:10:01,201
when you want to get pregnant.

193
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:03,940
Keeping secrets from me
would be counterproductive.

194
00:10:04,003 --> 00:10:07,246
It would be
like going to confession

195
00:10:07,307 --> 00:10:09,685
and not telling
the whole truth.

196
00:10:09,976 --> 00:10:12,149
You may want it
more than life itself,

197
00:10:12,212 --> 00:10:14,658
but you're not
getting absolution.

198
00:10:15,482 --> 00:10:18,793
The nuns at my school were less
sanctimonious than that guy.

199
00:10:18,852 --> 00:10:21,025
Your nuns never went
to medical school.

200
00:10:21,087 --> 00:10:23,966
You know those MD plates gets you
a better parking spot in heaven.

201
00:10:24,023 --> 00:10:26,560
Hey, with the fetus
less than three months old,

202
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,765
even if Parker beat his wife
to a pulp,

203
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:30,034
he didn't commit a murder.

204
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:31,598
Let's get back
to our real jobs.

205
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:34,406
Hey, Van Buren wants us to check
it out for spousal abuse.

206
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:35,741
Think of it like a vacation.

207
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:37,975
First of all, we don't have
a complaining witness.

208
00:10:38,037 --> 00:10:40,347
Second of all, we just heard
from the mouth of God

209
00:10:40,406 --> 00:10:41,476
that the husband was a saint.

210
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:43,487
Well, God never gave her
a full exam.

211
00:10:43,543 --> 00:10:45,318
Now, something caused
that miscarriage.

212
00:10:45,378 --> 00:10:47,324
Let's see if Coyle
can fit us in.

213
00:10:48,281 --> 00:10:50,591
Well, you were right.
She was in some kind of fight.

214
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,152
Well, bottom line it for us,
Coyle.

215
00:10:52,218 --> 00:10:54,664
Was Susan Parker the attacker
or the attackee?

216
00:10:54,721 --> 00:10:55,859
Let me show you.

217
00:10:55,922 --> 00:10:57,868
I'm Mrs. Parker. I go at you,

218
00:10:57,924 --> 00:11:01,371
so you grasp my wrists tight
and hold them away from you.

219
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:02,698
Now, I'm struggling.

220
00:11:02,762 --> 00:11:04,241
I want to
scratch your eyes out,

221
00:11:04,297 --> 00:11:06,937
but you push me away,
and I land on my butt,

222
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,946
banging my elbows
on the floor.

223
00:11:09,302 --> 00:11:12,511
The deceased had hematomas on her
wrists, right where you grabbed me.

224
00:11:12,572 --> 00:11:14,574
Her left elbow and buttock
revealed contusions

225
00:11:14,641 --> 00:11:16,245
probably from falling
on the floor.

226
00:11:16,309 --> 00:11:18,949
And you have no old bruises
or broken ribs?

227
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:20,218
Sorry.

228
00:11:20,313 --> 00:11:22,259
So,
Parker's telling the truth.

229
00:11:22,315 --> 00:11:24,761
Are you sure there was nothing
on her chest or her stomach?

230
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:26,728
Something that would cause her
to lose her baby?

231
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:27,890
Baby?

232
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:30,729
What baby?
This lady was never pregnant.

233
00:11:34,727 --> 00:11:36,934
What do you mean
she wasn't pregnant?

234
00:11:36,996 --> 00:11:40,375
The ME's absolutely positive,
Mr. Parker.

235
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,306
My God!

236
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:45,312
Are you sure Gilbert told
your wife she was pregnant?

237
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:48,784
He told her, all right. I was
standing there when he did.

238
00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:51,185
Gilbert told us
the same thing.

239
00:11:51,344 --> 00:11:52,880
You're going to arrest him,
right?

240
00:11:52,946 --> 00:11:54,948
There's nothing
we'd like better.

241
00:11:55,014 --> 00:11:56,152
What are you saying?

242
00:11:56,216 --> 00:12:00,028
The bottom line is all Gilbert did is
lie to your wife. It's not a crime.

243
00:12:00,086 --> 00:12:02,657
Lying's not a crime.
He took our money. It's fraud.

244
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:05,396
Only if he knew
his treatment wouldn't work.

245
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:07,995
The truth is
none of us know what happened.

246
00:12:08,127 --> 00:12:11,074
It could have been
a simple misdiagnosis.

247
00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:14,244
Doctors make mistakes.
Oh, some mistake.

248
00:12:14,334 --> 00:12:16,143
First he makes her crazy.
Then he gets her killed.

249
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:18,113
And you can't do anything
about it!

250
00:12:18,171 --> 00:12:19,878
Well, that's just great.

251
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:25,183
You know, this doctor could
have one hell of a scam going.

252
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:26,416
Think about it.

253
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:30,859
He takes the big fees, and he pumps
his patients full of this HCG stuff.

254
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:33,488
It doesn't work.
They start to get antsy,

255
00:12:33,553 --> 00:12:36,056
so he tells them what they want
to hear, they're pregnant.

256
00:12:36,122 --> 00:12:37,362
A couple of weeks later,

257
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:40,632
"Sorry, you lost the baby. Too bad.
These things happen."

258
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:42,138
Then he starts all over again

259
00:12:42,195 --> 00:12:43,833
and so do the big fees.

260
00:12:43,896 --> 00:12:47,503
The problem is Mrs. Parker
isn't available to testify.

261
00:12:48,468 --> 00:12:50,345
This doctor
has other patients, right?

262
00:12:50,403 --> 00:12:52,644
I'm sure he'll be happy
to send us his list.

263
00:12:52,705 --> 00:12:55,049
He will
if a judge tells him to.

264
00:12:58,745 --> 00:13:00,349
He convinced this woman
she was pregnant.

265
00:13:00,413 --> 00:13:01,983
And she wasn't?
No.

266
00:13:02,048 --> 00:13:04,324
Isn't it possible
he made a mistake?

267
00:13:04,484 --> 00:13:05,690
Well, I don't think so.

268
00:13:05,752 --> 00:13:08,164
He obviously showed her
someone else's sonogram.

269
00:13:08,221 --> 00:13:09,666
And there's a crime here?

270
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:12,362
There is if it's part
of a scheme to defraud.

271
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:14,238
Gilbert could be
selling pregnancies

272
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:17,332
like some con man
hawking swampland in Florida.

273
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:18,902
And what do you want?

274
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:21,036
A subpoena for his patients'
medical records.

275
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,478
I want to see if there were
any other false miscarriages.

276
00:13:23,536 --> 00:13:25,675
You know
I can't violate privilege.

277
00:13:25,738 --> 00:13:27,979
If we're right,
he's committing a felony.

278
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:30,920
His medical records were never
privileged in the first place.

279
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:32,547
So,
I have to violate privilege

280
00:13:32,612 --> 00:13:36,025
to prove criminal activity
in order to destroy privilege.

281
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:38,760
Running in circles
makes me dizzy, Counselor.

282
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:40,559
If we can just talk
to these women,

283
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:43,931
I'm sure the last thing
they'll scream is privilege.

284
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:46,026
(SIGHS)

285
00:13:46,092 --> 00:13:47,765
I'll give you your subpoena,
Counselor,

286
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,670
but only
for the express purpose

287
00:13:49,729 --> 00:13:52,005
of getting the names
of Dr. Gilbert's patients

288
00:13:52,065 --> 00:13:54,067
who allegedly miscarried.

289
00:13:55,635 --> 00:13:59,674
Barbara Goodman,
43. Marian Combs, 45.

290
00:14:00,206 --> 00:14:02,584
Sharon Lowe, 46.

291
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:05,212
Nothing like waiting
till the last minute.

292
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:07,918
Maybe they had
something better to do.

293
00:14:08,881 --> 00:14:10,918
You know, if I didn't already
know you don't have kids,

294
00:14:10,983 --> 00:14:12,963
I'd know you don't have kids.

295
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:16,262
I'm just saying, Lennie, women are
allowed to have other priorities.

296
00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:18,324
It's a long way from the '50s.

297
00:14:18,391 --> 00:14:21,668
Yeah, and those other priorities are
keeping Dr. Gilbert in business.

298
00:14:21,728 --> 00:14:24,800
I got 23 names
that had miscarriages.

299
00:14:24,931 --> 00:14:27,138
I already got 26.

300
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,602
That ought to be enough.

301
00:14:32,638 --> 00:14:35,414
Hell, I could party
with the best of them.

302
00:14:35,475 --> 00:14:38,319
There was always time
for kids later.

303
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:40,187
When Mr. Right comes along?

304
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:44,792
Mr. Right's whoever you happen to end
up with when you run out of gas.

305
00:14:44,951 --> 00:14:46,658
Mine's an investment banker.

306
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:49,256
All I had to do
was give him a son.

307
00:14:49,455 --> 00:14:53,028
Problem is it's not as easy
as they taught us in sex ed.

308
00:14:54,327 --> 00:14:57,069
You did have a miscarriage, right?
Two.

309
00:14:58,031 --> 00:15:01,638
After the first, my friend Clara
Brock told me about Dr. Gilbert.

310
00:15:01,801 --> 00:15:04,441
She was in the same boat, and
he'd worked wonders for her.

311
00:15:04,504 --> 00:15:08,077
Were you taking his HCG hormones
when you had the second one?

312
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:11,018
I started hemorrhaging
on the E train.

313
00:15:11,177 --> 00:15:13,783
Strangers took me
to Saint Vincent's.

314
00:15:15,648 --> 00:15:17,355
Are you're still trying?

315
00:15:18,885 --> 00:15:20,558
I'm 42 years old.

316
00:15:21,788 --> 00:15:23,062
What the hell?

317
00:15:23,122 --> 00:15:26,194
Selling expensive dresses
is plenty fulfilling.

318
00:15:28,361 --> 00:15:30,272
It blew us away.

319
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:32,468
We are so excited,
we can't stand it.

320
00:15:32,532 --> 00:15:33,909
BRISCOE: Thank you.
Sit.

321
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:37,509
We're in our eighth month.
It's like a miracle.

322
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:39,948
We owe it all to Dr. Gilbert.

323
00:15:40,406 --> 00:15:42,909
According to records,
you had a miscarriage.

324
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:44,784
Yeah, once on the Nautilus.

325
00:15:45,011 --> 00:15:47,514
Dr. Gilbert insisted
I stop working out.

326
00:15:47,747 --> 00:15:50,318
Were you on the hormone
treatments at the time?

327
00:15:50,383 --> 00:15:52,556
Infertility wasn't my problem.

328
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:55,064
We had to find someone
to fertilize Beth's eggs,

329
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:58,625
and Gilbert had the answer.
Donor number 2133x.

330
00:15:59,325 --> 00:16:01,032
Artificial insemination.

331
00:16:01,427 --> 00:16:04,408
It's the best relationship
lever had with a man.

332
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:06,704
I thought it was
supposed to be anonymous.

333
00:16:06,766 --> 00:16:08,677
That's exactly my point.

334
00:16:10,369 --> 00:16:13,680
I gotta ask you, don't you ever wonder?
Why would I?

335
00:16:13,773 --> 00:16:16,014
Dr. Gilbert assured us
the donor's healthy.

336
00:16:16,075 --> 00:16:18,316
Well, I just hope
he didn't get around too much.

337
00:16:18,377 --> 00:16:22,189
Dr. Gilbert told us a donor's
sperm is used four times, tops.

338
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:23,817
In a city of eight million,

339
00:16:23,883 --> 00:16:26,022
what are the odds our son will
ever meet one of his sisters,

340
00:16:26,085 --> 00:16:27,462
let alone have a baby
with her?

341
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,898
Look, we couldn't find out who the
father was even if we wanted to.

342
00:16:29,956 --> 00:16:31,299
It's strictly confidential.

343
00:16:31,357 --> 00:16:34,201
All we know is he doesn't smoke.
He doesn't drink.

344
00:16:34,527 --> 00:16:35,938
No criminal record,

345
00:16:36,529 --> 00:16:38,008
and he's a Roman Catholic.

346
00:16:38,064 --> 00:16:40,772
Don't forget
he's got Bette Davis eyes.

347
00:16:45,438 --> 00:16:49,784
Brother, and I thought I had it bad
being brought up by two alcoholics.

348
00:16:50,076 --> 00:16:52,852
I wonder which mommy's gonna
teach him to smoke and drink.

349
00:16:52,912 --> 00:16:54,016
And shave.

350
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,515
Well, it's the '90s.

351
00:16:55,581 --> 00:16:58,960
Everybody's allowed to be gross
and disgusting, not just you.

352
00:16:59,552 --> 00:17:01,828
Well, all I know
is I had one mommy,

353
00:17:01,888 --> 00:17:04,664
and she did enough ball-breaking
for one lifetime.

354
00:17:04,724 --> 00:17:06,670
Hey, what was that
party animal's name?

355
00:17:06,726 --> 00:17:09,070
The one that recommended
Dr. Gilbert.

356
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:14,806
Clara Brock.

357
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:18,041
Yeah, she had a miscarriage,
right? That's what she said.

358
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:19,945
Her name's not on the list.

359
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:28,821
So, I took Dr. Gilbert's hormone
treatments for two years.

360
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,485
Well,
I guess it finally worked.

361
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:32,154
CHILD: No.
Well, not that well.

362
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:35,756
It took forever to conceive, and
then I had several miscarriages.

363
00:17:35,821 --> 00:17:38,028
It was the most
traumatic time of my life.

364
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:41,333
You miscarried while you were
taking the hormone treatments?

365
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:44,398
Two months after I stopped,
along comes Bobby.

366
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:46,237
You know,
your friend Christine Kennedy

367
00:17:46,299 --> 00:17:49,371
says you conceived by
artificial insemination, right?

368
00:17:49,535 --> 00:17:51,014
Actually, it was in vitro.

369
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,414
My egg was fertilized
with my husband's sperm

370
00:17:53,472 --> 00:17:55,042
outside of my uterus.

371
00:17:55,141 --> 00:17:57,417
The rest of the process
was perfectly normal.

372
00:17:57,477 --> 00:18:00,947
Excuse me, it's 12:30. We can't
be late for Mommy and Me.

373
00:18:01,013 --> 00:18:03,220
(BABY CRYING)

374
00:18:03,849 --> 00:18:06,625
She takes the hormone
treatment for two years,

375
00:18:06,686 --> 00:18:08,825
stops and then gets pregnant?

376
00:18:08,955 --> 00:18:12,095
I'm starting to wonder
if this stuff ever works.

377
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:14,669
Here's one.

378
00:18:14,727 --> 00:18:17,674
Three years of hormone
treatments, nothing.

379
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:19,837
You'd think she'd catch on.

380
00:18:19,899 --> 00:18:22,880
Hey, I'm still waiting for Ed
McMahon to show up at my door.

381
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,972
The louder
the biological clock ticks,

382
00:18:25,037 --> 00:18:27,415
the richer Dr. Gilbert gets.

383
00:18:27,473 --> 00:18:30,352
Here's one.
Six months on the juice,

384
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:31,410
twins.

385
00:18:32,178 --> 00:18:34,215
Could be
Gilbert just got lucky.

386
00:18:36,182 --> 00:18:37,684
The two girlfriends?

387
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:39,761
Who'd they say the donor was?

388
00:18:42,521 --> 00:18:45,593
Donor number 2133x.

389
00:18:46,993 --> 00:18:49,803
I just found
the baby's half brother.

390
00:18:49,929 --> 00:18:51,806
John Joseph Desouza.

391
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:54,310
He lives down the block
from them.

392
00:18:54,567 --> 00:18:56,240
You think we should tell them?

393
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:59,681
What's the point? He might
not have Bette Davis eyes.

394
00:19:00,573 --> 00:19:01,847
Wait a minute,

395
00:19:03,009 --> 00:19:04,886
here's another one.

396
00:19:04,944 --> 00:19:07,550
Donor number 2133x.

397
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:09,524
This guy gets around.

398
00:19:09,582 --> 00:19:11,391
A little more than he should.

399
00:19:14,754 --> 00:19:17,360
I got three more.
You're kidding.

400
00:19:18,424 --> 00:19:19,767
I got one.

401
00:19:21,761 --> 00:19:23,138
I got two.

402
00:19:25,698 --> 00:19:27,837
Didn't Dr. Gilbert
tell his patients

403
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,642
he only used
each donor four times?

404
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:37,585
Oh, my God.

405
00:19:37,743 --> 00:19:39,984
It's like bad science fiction.

406
00:19:40,413 --> 00:19:41,653
Are you absolutely sure?

407
00:19:41,714 --> 00:19:44,092
There are 42 women
artificially inseminated

408
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:45,686
with the same donor's sperm.

409
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:48,755
I've gotta believe they
expected a little variation.

410
00:19:48,821 --> 00:19:50,061
We're talking fraud.

411
00:19:50,122 --> 00:19:53,069
And we'd have a great case if we
actually knew about any of this.

412
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:55,799
Excuse me?
We have the medical records.

413
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:59,968
Forty-two babies
can call Mr. 2133x Daddy.

414
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:01,739
Only the subpoena was limited.

415
00:20:01,801 --> 00:20:03,906
We were entitled to use
the medical records

416
00:20:03,969 --> 00:20:07,212
to obtain the names of women
with miscarriages. Period.

417
00:20:07,273 --> 00:20:10,254
Outside of that, everything on
those records is inadmissible.

418
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:13,756
Unless we get a judge
with a little common sense.

419
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:20,129
If I allow you to bring charges based
on what you got and where you got it,

420
00:20:20,186 --> 00:20:22,063
I'd be looking
at a sure-fire reversal.

421
00:20:22,121 --> 00:20:24,397
Now, I'm sure you know this
hasn't been a very good year.

422
00:20:24,457 --> 00:20:26,232
What about
inevitable discovery?

423
00:20:26,292 --> 00:20:27,600
The only thing
that's inevitable

424
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,333
is that you wouldn't have
given a second thought

425
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:30,669
to this artificial
insemination

426
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:32,801
but for the unlawful use
of medical records.

427
00:20:32,865 --> 00:20:35,277
Most of the 42 babies
live in the Upper West Side.

428
00:20:35,334 --> 00:20:37,314
They'll grow up together,
go to the same schools...

429
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:38,814
I've seen Deliverance, Claire.

430
00:20:38,871 --> 00:20:42,751
Now, look, I can bend as far
right as the next guy in a robe

431
00:20:43,209 --> 00:20:47,214
when a cop pushes the envelope
or a prosecutor screws up,

432
00:20:47,713 --> 00:20:50,250
but doctor-patient privilege,
that's another ball game.

433
00:20:50,316 --> 00:20:53,024
I'm sorry,
but there's no way around it.

434
00:20:54,153 --> 00:20:55,154
Fine.

435
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:01,935
Look, I'm the only one
in the DA's office

436
00:21:01,994 --> 00:21:04,167
who knows
what Dr. Gilbert's up to.

437
00:21:05,331 --> 00:21:07,174
I'll set up a Chinese wall.

438
00:21:07,233 --> 00:21:09,770
Someone else in the office
will handle the case.

439
00:21:09,835 --> 00:21:13,146
And you'll cross your heart
not to talk to them about it?

440
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:14,206
No.

441
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,678
But I will sign an affidavit swearing
not to communicate in any way

442
00:21:17,743 --> 00:21:21,748
with the new attorney regarding
the unlawfully obtained material.

443
00:21:21,881 --> 00:21:23,724
If you even peek
over the wall, Counselor,

444
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:26,263
you can kiss
your license goodbye.

445
00:21:26,419 --> 00:21:29,025
Chinese wall?
And he actually bought it?

446
00:21:29,422 --> 00:21:31,766
As long as I signed
my life away.

447
00:21:31,824 --> 00:21:33,531
I tell anyone anything
that I know,

448
00:21:33,592 --> 00:21:36,232
I'm on the express train
to the Disciplinary Committee.

449
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:37,603
Is it worth it?

450
00:21:38,097 --> 00:21:39,599
Yeah, it's worth it.

451
00:21:40,499 --> 00:21:42,672
So, who do we send
on this wild-goose chase?

452
00:21:42,735 --> 00:21:47,013
Well, I don't remember seeing any
vacation memos with your name on it.

453
00:21:48,274 --> 00:21:51,847
Ms. Kincaid goes out on a limb,
she puts her career on the line.

454
00:21:51,911 --> 00:21:53,982
It must be comforting to her

455
00:21:54,046 --> 00:21:56,549
to know that she's got
90% of your support.

456
00:22:01,287 --> 00:22:04,029
You'll take
the Dworkin severance motion?

457
00:22:06,092 --> 00:22:09,699
Judge Spivack,
Part 93, tomorrow at 9:30.

458
00:22:09,795 --> 00:22:10,933
You got it.

459
00:22:12,064 --> 00:22:13,907
And I'll go chase my tail.

460
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,977
Start by using your head.

461
00:22:16,135 --> 00:22:18,979
The cops were investigating
another fraud

462
00:22:19,038 --> 00:22:20,517
when they hit the motherlode.

463
00:22:20,573 --> 00:22:24,578
Now, what's the first thing you think
of when you hear the word "fraud"?

464
00:22:24,643 --> 00:22:26,350
Financial records.

465
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:28,291
I don't give a damn
what it says.

466
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:31,851
I'm not giving you anything
until my attorney gets here.

467
00:22:31,917 --> 00:22:33,658
You can be held
in contempt, sir.

468
00:22:33,719 --> 00:22:37,758
I understand everyone being upset
over what happened to Susan Parker.

469
00:22:37,823 --> 00:22:41,293
Believe me, I feel for her
more than you can imagine.

470
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:46,475
But disrupting my practice? Well,
if you have nothing to hide...

471
00:22:46,532 --> 00:22:49,308
My patients expect
some sort of privacy.

472
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:51,370
They rely on it,
for God's sake.

473
00:22:51,637 --> 00:22:52,980
Thank God.

474
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:56,110
Michael, will you tell me
what's going on here?

475
00:22:56,575 --> 00:22:59,613
Mr. McCoy, I'm Michael Aronson.
I represent Dr. Gilbert.

476
00:22:59,678 --> 00:23:01,351
Good. Then you can explain
to your client

477
00:23:01,413 --> 00:23:03,859
the meaning
of a subpoena duces tecum.

478
00:23:03,916 --> 00:23:05,327
We've been though this
once already

479
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:07,125
with someone from your office
named Kincaid.

480
00:23:07,186 --> 00:23:08,688
Don't you people
talk to each other?

481
00:23:08,754 --> 00:23:11,064
If you'd read the subpoena,
you'll see that this time

482
00:23:11,123 --> 00:23:13,763
we're asking for Dr. Gilbert's
financial records.

483
00:23:13,826 --> 00:23:16,739
I've been practicing medicine
for 28 years.

484
00:23:16,962 --> 00:23:19,738
How dare you... Now, it's all right, Jordan.
It's all right.

485
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:21,800
We'll give them the documents.

486
00:23:21,867 --> 00:23:26,043
And while they're reading them, I'll be
drafting my complaint for harassment.

487
00:23:29,808 --> 00:23:32,049
Well, Claire convinced Spivack

488
00:23:32,478 --> 00:23:35,857
to dismiss
the severance motion.

489
00:23:36,215 --> 00:23:38,024
The Dworkins
will be tried together.

490
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:39,562
Lucky her.

491
00:23:40,886 --> 00:23:42,160
No wild geese?

492
00:23:43,322 --> 00:23:45,962
Well,
Gilbert made a lot of money.

493
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:50,163
Some of these women
paid him more than $50,000.

494
00:23:50,229 --> 00:23:53,039
If you're going to be desperate,
you might as well be rich.

495
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:55,009
I checked with other
infertility doctors.

496
00:23:55,067 --> 00:23:57,980
His fees are not
out of line.

497
00:23:59,638 --> 00:24:00,946
Just a minute.

498
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:09,015
Three years ago,
Gilbert collected $650,000.

499
00:24:10,049 --> 00:24:12,290
Last year,
he was down to $580,000.

500
00:24:13,819 --> 00:24:15,856
Recession's been rough
on everybody.

501
00:24:15,921 --> 00:24:18,060
Yeah, but his net profits
went up, Adam.

502
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:21,070
And his expenses went down.
That's right.

503
00:24:22,061 --> 00:24:25,042
And the biggest drop
was in laboratory costs.

504
00:24:25,564 --> 00:24:27,601
HIV tests on donor's sperm

505
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:31,808
for patients undergoing
artificial insemination,

506
00:24:33,706 --> 00:24:36,414
$75,000 in '91.

507
00:24:36,842 --> 00:24:38,947
And down to zero last year.

508
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:42,186
Could be that the labs are
billing the patients direct.

509
00:24:42,248 --> 00:24:46,094
Or else he's playing Russian
roulette with these babies' lives.

510
00:24:51,657 --> 00:24:56,037
There are perhaps seven reputable
infertility clinics in the five boroughs.

511
00:24:56,095 --> 00:24:59,133
As far as I know, we do the
testing for all of them.

512
00:24:59,832 --> 00:25:02,142
You did the work for
Dr. Gilbert, too, didn't you?

513
00:25:02,201 --> 00:25:04,078
He was high volume.

514
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:06,976
When he dropped maybe 75%
three years ago,

515
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:09,144
I figured
his business was off.

516
00:25:09,208 --> 00:25:11,916
Then two years ago
he went down to zero.

517
00:25:12,044 --> 00:25:14,752
I assumed he found some
out-of-town lab to do the work.

518
00:25:14,813 --> 00:25:17,487
Or he decided it wasn't
necessary to keep testing.

519
00:25:17,549 --> 00:25:19,790
Well, then,
I hope he has a good lawyer.

520
00:25:19,852 --> 00:25:22,059
Do you know what the odds
of having an infected baby are

521
00:25:22,121 --> 00:25:25,432
if an egg is fertilized
by an HIV-positive sperm?

522
00:25:25,691 --> 00:25:27,329
You don't want to know.

523
00:25:27,826 --> 00:25:29,806
People are paranoid,

524
00:25:29,862 --> 00:25:31,637
and for good reason.

525
00:25:32,131 --> 00:25:33,906
Why is the testing
so expensive?

526
00:25:33,966 --> 00:25:35,240
Well, the way it works is,

527
00:25:35,301 --> 00:25:38,407
we receive the donor sperm.
We freeze it for 60 days,

528
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:39,608
then we test it.

529
00:25:39,672 --> 00:25:41,743
It is expensive
and time-consuming,

530
00:25:41,807 --> 00:25:45,254
but it's also the safest way
known to medical science.

531
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:47,785
Open up medical records?

532
00:25:47,846 --> 00:25:50,417
I'm sure you've heard
of doctor-patient privilege.

533
00:25:50,482 --> 00:25:53,292
Which is supposed to
protect the patient.

534
00:25:54,486 --> 00:25:56,727
There's a possibility
that Dr. Gilbert

535
00:25:56,789 --> 00:25:59,531
was using infected sperm.

536
00:26:00,092 --> 00:26:01,332
Infected as in...

537
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:06,433
Dr. Gilbert stopped running HIV
tests on donor sperm two years ago.

538
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:09,306
My God.

539
00:26:09,802 --> 00:26:11,509
This is a licensed physician?

540
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:13,481
If any of the babies
are infected,

541
00:26:13,539 --> 00:26:16,349
Gilbert's acting
with reckless disregard.

542
00:26:16,642 --> 00:26:18,918
It's a crime.
It can't be privileged.

543
00:26:19,311 --> 00:26:21,814
And if none of them
are infected?

544
00:26:22,047 --> 00:26:24,687
We have disregarded
one of the tenets

545
00:26:25,117 --> 00:26:26,619
of personal freedom.

546
00:26:27,152 --> 00:26:29,928
Somehow I think the parents
will thank us for it.

547
00:26:37,396 --> 00:26:38,568
It can't be.

548
00:26:38,864 --> 00:26:40,138
You're wrong.

549
00:26:40,199 --> 00:26:44,011
I hope I am, too, Mrs. Cooper,
but I think we should be safe.

550
00:26:44,203 --> 00:26:45,443
A blood test...

551
00:26:45,504 --> 00:26:47,313
Dr. Gilbert told us
that the donor was healthy.

552
00:26:47,373 --> 00:26:48,613
We didn't have to worry.

553
00:26:48,674 --> 00:26:49,778
We have reason to believe

554
00:26:49,842 --> 00:26:52,789
that Dr. Gilbert
has been less than honest.

555
00:26:53,512 --> 00:26:54,513
No.

556
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:56,721
He gave us Dennis.

557
00:26:56,782 --> 00:26:58,784
He wouldn't lie.
He couldn't...

558
00:27:00,252 --> 00:27:01,526
I don't have to listen to you.

559
00:27:01,587 --> 00:27:02,827
No, you don't.

560
00:27:03,689 --> 00:27:05,259
But if it were my son...

561
00:27:14,566 --> 00:27:16,204
There are times
when I love this job.

562
00:27:16,268 --> 00:27:19,112
Thirty-one blood samples.
All HIV-negative.

563
00:27:19,171 --> 00:27:21,310
Thank you for small favors.

564
00:27:21,874 --> 00:27:23,444
I should tell the parents.

565
00:27:23,509 --> 00:27:26,718
No need. I already received
17 bottles of champagne

566
00:27:26,779 --> 00:27:28,383
and eight bottles of Scotch.

567
00:27:28,447 --> 00:27:30,120
The bearer of good news.

568
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:32,659
Well, it wasn't all good.

569
00:27:33,685 --> 00:27:37,155
It's the strangest thing. Twenty-five
of these babies are CF carriers.

570
00:27:37,222 --> 00:27:39,361
What's CF?
Cystic fibrosis.

571
00:27:39,825 --> 00:27:42,431
It's a recessive trait,
like blue eyes.

572
00:27:42,528 --> 00:27:43,939
They'll never show
any symptoms,

573
00:27:43,996 --> 00:27:47,000
but if they happen to make
babies with another carrier...

574
00:27:47,065 --> 00:27:48,703
The disease will show up.

575
00:27:48,767 --> 00:27:50,872
Two carriers connect,

576
00:27:50,936 --> 00:27:54,474
it's a one-in-four chance
the kid'll be affected.

577
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:59,316
CF carriers are a very small part of
the population, but still it's a risk.

578
00:27:59,378 --> 00:28:01,915
If they're a small
part of the population,

579
00:28:02,047 --> 00:28:04,926
isn't it odd that so many of
these babies are carriers?

580
00:28:04,983 --> 00:28:07,293
Well, it's either cause
for an article

581
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:09,992
in The New England Journal
of Medicine, or...

582
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:13,363
They're all related.

583
00:28:16,795 --> 00:28:20,265
It looks like the Chinese wall
just came tumbling down.

584
00:28:21,133 --> 00:28:22,908
You talk. I can't.

585
00:28:22,968 --> 00:28:25,676
At least 25
of Dr. Gilbert's patients

586
00:28:25,737 --> 00:28:28,115
were inseminated
with the same sperm.

587
00:28:29,308 --> 00:28:30,616
Thank God.

588
00:28:30,676 --> 00:28:34,214
I'll buy the champagne.
You'll buy the whole dinner.

589
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:37,556
There's no way these women
would have agreed to this.

590
00:28:37,616 --> 00:28:40,256
I'm sure
we can make a case for fraud.

591
00:28:41,286 --> 00:28:42,890
Is that all you found?

592
00:28:43,956 --> 00:28:45,867
There's more?
A lot.

593
00:28:46,658 --> 00:28:50,538
Dr. Gilbert stopped testing
the sperm for the HIV virus.

594
00:28:50,829 --> 00:28:52,536
Oh, my God.

595
00:28:52,598 --> 00:28:55,044
Fortunately, not one of
the babies is infected.

596
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:57,740
But I was thinking, why would
someone as smart as Dr. Gilbert

597
00:28:57,803 --> 00:29:00,010
take such an enormous risk?

598
00:29:00,873 --> 00:29:04,150
One infected baby, his
entire practice heads south.

599
00:29:04,543 --> 00:29:06,716
He was lucky the donor
was healthy.

600
00:29:09,281 --> 00:29:10,658
Or he was sure.

601
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:12,954
Come on, Jack.

602
00:29:13,018 --> 00:29:15,498
I have seen at least 12 public
service announcements a day

603
00:29:15,554 --> 00:29:18,660
telling me that's impossible.
Think about it.

604
00:29:18,991 --> 00:29:22,302
In this day and age, how
could you be sure of anyone?

605
00:29:26,698 --> 00:29:29,702
The son of a bitch
is using his own sperm.

606
00:29:32,938 --> 00:29:35,509
I just bought a round for two
justices of the Court of Appeals.

607
00:29:35,574 --> 00:29:36,644
This better be good.

608
00:29:36,708 --> 00:29:39,985
It's about Dr. Gilbert, sir. Oh, right.
Your baby doctor.

609
00:29:40,045 --> 00:29:43,185
Mr. McCoy, working independently,
uncovered concrete evidence

610
00:29:43,248 --> 00:29:46,286
that 25 babies were conceived
by the same donor sperm.

611
00:29:47,853 --> 00:29:49,127
And what?

612
00:29:49,988 --> 00:29:52,025
Twenty-six is on the way?

613
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:54,297
Look, this can wait
until morning.

614
00:29:55,861 --> 00:29:59,832
We have good reason to believe
that that donor is Dr. Gilbert.

615
00:30:01,033 --> 00:30:04,242
And you didn't give him even a
little push in the right direction?

616
00:30:04,303 --> 00:30:05,680
Not even a nudge.

617
00:30:05,737 --> 00:30:07,546
As we have both sworn
in these affidavits.

618
00:30:07,606 --> 00:30:09,051
Now, that's very interesting.

619
00:30:09,107 --> 00:30:11,212
And, granted,
I am on my third martini,

620
00:30:11,276 --> 00:30:13,916
but I don't really see
what this has to do with me.

621
00:30:13,979 --> 00:30:15,754
We want to arrest Gilbert.

622
00:30:15,881 --> 00:30:17,827
There's nothing I'd like more.

623
00:30:20,252 --> 00:30:21,595
The problem is

624
00:30:22,054 --> 00:30:25,263
he hasn't done anything
that even smells criminal.

625
00:30:27,125 --> 00:30:30,538
Judge Ianello may drink
too much, but he's right.

626
00:30:31,963 --> 00:30:35,467
If it turns out to be true,
what Gilbert did is disgusting,

627
00:30:35,534 --> 00:30:38,208
but there's nothing in the penal
code that says he can't do it.

628
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:39,613
He manipulated these women.

629
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:40,945
He lied to them,

630
00:30:41,006 --> 00:30:42,849
and one of them wound up dead
because of him.

631
00:30:42,908 --> 00:30:44,819
You can't prove causation.

632
00:30:44,877 --> 00:30:47,255
Man promised them a baby.
He gave them one.

633
00:30:47,312 --> 00:30:48,916
He didn't promise them
his baby.

634
00:30:48,981 --> 00:30:52,588
From what I understand, the contract
calls for an anonymous donor.

635
00:30:52,751 --> 00:30:55,459
It's possible
that Gilbert is an SOB,

636
00:30:56,254 --> 00:30:59,895
but so far, unfortunately,
he's an anonymous SOB.

637
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:03,529
Wait a minute.
At least one of his patients,

638
00:31:03,595 --> 00:31:05,040
Clara Brock,

639
00:31:06,031 --> 00:31:08,238
she didn't contract
for an anonymous donor.

640
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:10,940
She thought she was being
impregnated by her husband's sperm.

641
00:31:11,003 --> 00:31:12,414
That's just great.

642
00:31:13,105 --> 00:31:16,245
I'm sure the Brocks will be
thrilled to hear about this.

643
00:31:18,009 --> 00:31:19,818
I don't believe this.

644
00:31:20,045 --> 00:31:21,388
It can't be.

645
00:31:21,446 --> 00:31:22,925
You should just go.

646
00:31:23,014 --> 00:31:24,084
CLAIRE: We're sorry, but...

647
00:31:24,149 --> 00:31:26,322
No, Dr. Lang told us
that Gilbert was the best.

648
00:31:26,385 --> 00:31:28,331
Do you have any evidence?

649
00:31:28,387 --> 00:31:31,027
We have good reason to believe.
You believe?

650
00:31:31,356 --> 00:31:32,528
Well, I'll tell you what.

651
00:31:32,591 --> 00:31:35,663
You don't come here and tell
me that Bobby's not my boy

652
00:31:35,794 --> 00:31:37,501
until you are damn sure.

653
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:40,304
A blood test would give us
all the proof we'd need.

654
00:31:40,365 --> 00:31:41,844
What the hell good
would that do?

655
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:44,938
I realize this is a difficult
situation, Mr. Brock,

656
00:31:46,605 --> 00:31:49,017
but Dr. Gilbert
has to be stopped.

657
00:31:51,143 --> 00:31:54,681
With your testimony, we could
put him in prison for fraud.

658
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,224
Nathan's parents
were here yesterday.

659
00:31:57,282 --> 00:31:59,125
Bobby's their
only grandchild.

660
00:31:59,184 --> 00:32:01,926
How can we tell them
that Bobby's...

661
00:32:03,121 --> 00:32:06,000
How can we tell Bobby?
We're not telling anybody.

662
00:32:07,292 --> 00:32:08,965
You want him in prison,

663
00:32:09,027 --> 00:32:10,631
you'll do it without us.

664
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:20,811
Larceny by false promise.

665
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,880
We need someone to testify
that Gilbert lied.

666
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:26,513
We could subpoena the Brocks.

667
00:32:26,578 --> 00:32:28,580
And they'd ignore it.

668
00:32:29,481 --> 00:32:32,724
The son of a bitch lied to his patients.
He defrauded them.

669
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:35,230
Hell, one's even dead
because of him.

670
00:32:35,287 --> 00:32:37,631
Yeah, he belongs in jail,

671
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:42,067
but without a little help from the
Brocks or from the penal law,

672
00:32:42,127 --> 00:32:43,572
there's nothing we can do.

673
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:47,007
I know we've dropped cases
before, Jack, but this one...

674
00:33:01,947 --> 00:33:02,948
Hey.

675
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:07,262
We've got a blood sample
from the Brocks' baby, right?

676
00:33:07,719 --> 00:33:08,720
Yeah.

677
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,993
If we could get Gilbert
to take a blood test,

678
00:33:11,056 --> 00:33:13,798
we could prove
he's the actual father.

679
00:33:19,264 --> 00:33:20,800
ARONSON: The Fourth Amendment.

680
00:33:21,066 --> 00:33:23,376
Last I looked,
it protected one's person

681
00:33:23,435 --> 00:33:25,642
against unreasonable searches
and seizures.

682
00:33:25,704 --> 00:33:27,342
The Supreme Court
has repeatedly held

683
00:33:27,405 --> 00:33:29,749
that the individual's right
against bodily intrusions

684
00:33:29,808 --> 00:33:32,311
should be weighed against
the society's interests

685
00:33:32,377 --> 00:33:34,015
in conducting the search.

686
00:33:34,079 --> 00:33:35,888
Every day
the police draw blood

687
00:33:35,947 --> 00:33:38,723
to determine if a suspect
is driving while intoxicated.

688
00:33:38,784 --> 00:33:41,560
Yes, but only when the driver
appears to be drunk.

689
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:43,122
It's called probable cause.

690
00:33:43,188 --> 00:33:44,496
And it's noticeably
lacking here.

691
00:33:44,556 --> 00:33:46,502
Medical records
show that Dr. Gilbert

692
00:33:46,558 --> 00:33:49,129
used sperm from the same donor
at least 20 times.

693
00:33:49,194 --> 00:33:53,609
There's absolutely no evidence that
that donor is my client, Your Honor.

694
00:33:54,065 --> 00:33:55,203
Mr. McCoy?

695
00:33:55,834 --> 00:33:58,337
It's the only logical
conclusion, Your Honor.

696
00:33:58,403 --> 00:34:01,316
JUDGE STEIN: This is a criminal
prosecution, Mr. McCoy.

697
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:04,785
Before I authorize a scavenger
hunt on a man's body,

698
00:34:04,843 --> 00:34:09,588
I'll need some evidence tending
to implicate him in that crime.

699
00:34:10,916 --> 00:34:14,227
The defense motion to quash
the subpoena is granted.

700
00:34:15,287 --> 00:34:17,198
JACK: It's the perfect scam.

701
00:34:18,323 --> 00:34:21,429
His marks thank him, and the
judicial system protects him.

702
00:34:21,493 --> 00:34:23,632
Babies cooked up
in laboratories.

703
00:34:23,695 --> 00:34:26,642
Not everyone is able to procreate
the old-fashioned way.

704
00:34:26,698 --> 00:34:29,372
I have no problem
with science, young lady.

705
00:34:29,434 --> 00:34:32,938
I just wish it would take a breather
now and then to let the law catch up.

706
00:34:33,004 --> 00:34:35,245
JACK: Maybe we're looking
at the wrong law.

707
00:34:35,307 --> 00:34:38,151
If Dr. Gilbert really did
use his own sperm,

708
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:42,422
then the contract between him and
the Brocks is null and void.

709
00:34:42,814 --> 00:34:44,054
Under civil law,

710
00:34:44,115 --> 00:34:47,790
he's the de facto and the de
jure father of that child,

711
00:34:47,853 --> 00:34:51,096
and with that comes a whole
boatload of legal obligations,

712
00:34:51,189 --> 00:34:52,566
including child support.

713
00:34:52,624 --> 00:34:53,967
Excellent.

714
00:34:54,292 --> 00:34:56,738
The Brocks won't testify,
and what are you gonna do,

715
00:34:56,795 --> 00:34:58,832
cross-examine a test tube?

716
00:34:58,897 --> 00:35:00,240
CLAIRE:
We don't need the Brocks.

717
00:35:00,298 --> 00:35:02,778
Child support is the right of
the child, not the parent.

718
00:35:02,834 --> 00:35:05,815
And the burden in family court is
much lighter than criminal court.

719
00:35:05,871 --> 00:35:07,782
No, I'll tell you what we do.

720
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:12,080
Get Ms. Kincaid
appointed guardian <i>ad</i> {item

721
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:14,690
to sue for paternity
on the baby's behalf.

722
00:35:14,746 --> 00:35:17,090
The first step in a paternity
suit is a blood test.

723
00:35:17,149 --> 00:35:20,323
And if it says what we think it
does, we nail the son of a bitch.

724
00:35:24,723 --> 00:35:26,100
CLAIRE:
And what led you to conclude

725
00:35:26,157 --> 00:35:28,865
that Dr. Gilbert
was the father of Baby Doe?

726
00:35:29,661 --> 00:35:31,766
After testing the blood
of 31 babies

727
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:34,276
artificially conceived
in Dr. Gilbert's office,

728
00:35:34,332 --> 00:35:37,108
our lab informed us
that it was extremely likely

729
00:35:37,168 --> 00:35:40,240
that the sperm of only
one donor had been used.

730
00:35:40,305 --> 00:35:44,378
Further investigation
of Dr. Gilbert's finances

731
00:35:44,442 --> 00:35:46,183
showed that he had
stopped paying

732
00:35:46,244 --> 00:35:48,019
both for sperm donors

733
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:50,888
and for HIV testing
of the sperm.

734
00:35:51,449 --> 00:35:53,952
It was the only
logical conclusion.

735
00:35:54,252 --> 00:35:55,788
Thank you, Mr. McCoy.

736
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:04,331
Why isn't the baby's
mother here, Mr. McCoy?

737
00:36:05,096 --> 00:36:07,940
Under the circumstances,
her testimony isn't relevant.

738
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:12,038
Well, you'd think she'd be a little
interested about the results.

739
00:36:12,237 --> 00:36:14,979
This suit is brought
on behalf of the baby.

740
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,383
Oh, I see.

741
00:36:17,075 --> 00:36:19,988
Is the baby lacking for money?
No.

742
00:36:20,612 --> 00:36:23,320
For food or shelter?
No.

743
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:27,891
Would you consider Baby Doe's
mother in any way inadequate?

744
00:36:28,386 --> 00:36:31,299
I don't think that's in any
way relevant to this case.

745
00:36:31,356 --> 00:36:32,892
Oh, it's very relevant,
Mr. McCoy.

746
00:36:32,958 --> 00:36:35,029
You see,
on this side of Center Street,

747
00:36:35,093 --> 00:36:38,267
all that's relevant
is the baby's best interests.

748
00:36:41,166 --> 00:36:42,236
I'm aware of that.

749
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:43,802
And in your opinion,

750
00:36:44,002 --> 00:36:47,415
this baby would somehow
benefit from this litigation?

751
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:49,643
Yes, I believe that's true.

752
00:36:49,708 --> 00:36:51,210
Considering the mother
doesn't give a damn,

753
00:36:51,276 --> 00:36:53,950
I'd say
that's pretty arrogant of you.

754
00:36:54,145 --> 00:36:55,146
Arrogant?

755
00:36:55,981 --> 00:36:58,860
Arrogant is trying to start
your own race of people.

756
00:37:00,318 --> 00:37:02,457
Move to strike.
Sustained.

757
00:37:03,588 --> 00:37:05,932
GILBERT: I'd say
over the past 10 years,

758
00:37:06,324 --> 00:37:08,429
somewhere in the neighborhood
of 300 babies

759
00:37:08,493 --> 00:37:12,236
were conceived in my office
through artificial insemination.

760
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:14,205
And in these 300 cases,

761
00:37:14,266 --> 00:37:17,338
has a mother ever requested the
identification of the donor?

762
00:37:17,402 --> 00:37:18,847
On the contrary.

763
00:37:19,337 --> 00:37:21,248
After the health of the baby,

764
00:37:21,406 --> 00:37:25,411
a mother's primary concern is
usually the anonymity of the donor.

765
00:37:25,543 --> 00:37:29,081
In cases when the patient's
husband's sperm is used,

766
00:37:29,147 --> 00:37:31,718
has anyone ever questioned
the heredity of the baby?

767
00:37:31,783 --> 00:37:32,853
No.

768
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:37,764
Was Baby Doe the result of fertilizing her
mother's egg with her father's sperm?

769
00:37:37,956 --> 00:37:39,060
I'm sorry.

770
00:37:39,557 --> 00:37:42,037
My hands are tied
by confidentiality.

771
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:45,267
I cannot in good conscience
answer that question.

772
00:37:45,897 --> 00:37:47,001
Thank you.

773
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,038
Hypothetically, Doctor,

774
00:37:50,602 --> 00:37:54,675
if a husband's sperm is used, is it
typically tested for the HIV virus?

775
00:37:54,739 --> 00:37:55,774
No.

776
00:37:55,874 --> 00:38:00,380
It's simpler to run blood tests on
the father before the procedure.

777
00:38:00,578 --> 00:38:01,579
I see.

778
00:38:01,813 --> 00:38:05,955
Do you also test to see if the
father is a cystic fibrosis carrier?

779
00:38:06,317 --> 00:38:07,421
No, I don't.

780
00:38:07,485 --> 00:38:10,295
Would that be considered
by some to be negligent?

781
00:38:10,422 --> 00:38:12,595
The people who come
to my office want a baby.

782
00:38:12,657 --> 00:38:15,570
I doubt it would stop any of them
even if they knew for a fact

783
00:38:15,627 --> 00:38:20,007
the father was a carrier.
Besides, CF only affects

784
00:38:20,365 --> 00:38:23,972
a miniscule portion
of the population at large.

785
00:38:24,235 --> 00:38:25,441
That's odd,

786
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:29,382
because 25 out of the 31 babies
conceived in your office

787
00:38:29,441 --> 00:38:32,786
through artificial insemination
over the past two years

788
00:38:32,844 --> 00:38:34,084
are carriers.

789
00:38:34,779 --> 00:38:36,781
How do you explain that?

790
00:38:39,818 --> 00:38:41,957
Answer the question, Doctor.

791
00:38:45,857 --> 00:38:47,336
I can't explain it.

792
00:38:47,592 --> 00:38:50,334
Then, we'll let your blood
do your talking for you.

793
00:38:50,395 --> 00:38:54,104
I order you to undergo a paternity
test within the next two weeks.

794
00:38:59,971 --> 00:39:03,509
Nothing like a little forum shopping, Jack.
Whatever it takes.

795
00:39:03,675 --> 00:39:06,918
My office will contact you
with the name of a doctor.

796
00:39:06,978 --> 00:39:08,924
I'll save you the time.

797
00:39:09,848 --> 00:39:13,318
We'll stipulate that Dr. Gilbert
is the baby's father.

798
00:39:13,384 --> 00:39:16,695
In that case, he's under arrest
for larceny by false promise.

799
00:39:16,755 --> 00:39:18,098
Yeah, right.

800
00:39:18,156 --> 00:39:20,193
And that'll last
for all of about two seconds.

801
00:39:20,258 --> 00:39:23,102
No way this gets past
a motion to dismiss.

802
00:39:26,598 --> 00:39:28,908
The indictment is deficient
on its face, Your Honor.

803
00:39:28,967 --> 00:39:31,777
The grand jury didn't think so.
The grand jury?

804
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:34,812
Twenty-three blind men following
the Pied Piper out of Hamelin.

805
00:39:34,873 --> 00:39:36,352
I'm glad you have
so much respect

806
00:39:36,407 --> 00:39:38,580
for our judicial system,
Mr. Aronson.

807
00:39:38,643 --> 00:39:40,122
Oh, let's not be naive.

808
00:39:40,178 --> 00:39:42,124
The state tells them
to indict, they indict,

809
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:44,251
the sufficiency of the
evidence notwithstanding.

810
00:39:44,315 --> 00:39:46,317
Just so long as they can get
home in time for Oprah.

811
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:49,763
There's sufficient evidence to indict
your client for felony larceny.

812
00:39:49,821 --> 00:39:53,234
Excuse me. The charge is
larceny by false promise.

813
00:39:53,658 --> 00:39:57,003
Show me one instance in the
transcript where one witness claims

814
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:58,563
that Dr. Gilbert lied
about anything.

815
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:00,769
JACK: The grand jury
can infer whatever it likes.

816
00:40:00,832 --> 00:40:04,370
Hold on. Are you saying that
the parents didn't testify?

817
00:40:04,969 --> 00:40:08,348
It's a difficult situation, Your Honor.
You're damn right it is,

818
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:10,477
and it's getting
more difficult for you.

819
00:40:10,542 --> 00:40:12,283
Legally, I don't need
their testimony.

820
00:40:12,343 --> 00:40:14,880
That's right,
on a law school exam.

821
00:40:14,946 --> 00:40:18,758
In the real world, a fraud trial
without the testimony of the victims

822
00:40:18,816 --> 00:40:20,557
ends in a mistrial.

823
00:40:20,919 --> 00:40:23,900
They don't get on the stand,
we don't go to court.

824
00:40:23,955 --> 00:40:25,525
These people
have a right to privacy.

825
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:28,002
And my client has a right
to confront his accusers.

826
00:40:28,059 --> 00:40:30,665
I think we can make everyone
happy if we close the courtroom.

827
00:40:30,728 --> 00:40:31,832
Seal the records.

828
00:40:31,896 --> 00:40:33,807
She makes a very good point,
Counselor.

829
00:40:33,865 --> 00:40:35,435
The public
has a right to know.

830
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:37,844
Well, you can talk to the
press anytime you like,

831
00:40:37,902 --> 00:40:40,143
just keep the Brocks' name
out of it.

832
00:40:40,238 --> 00:40:44,448
My clerk will contact you about
the first free date for a trial.

833
00:40:46,144 --> 00:40:47,953
Nice move, Claire.

834
00:40:48,413 --> 00:40:51,690
Now all we have to do
is get the Brocks to testify.

835
00:40:52,584 --> 00:40:55,861
Look, we already told you once, we
are not going into a courtroom.

836
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:59,094
We can arrange for it
to be completely anonymous.

837
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:00,931
If you prefer,
you can wear disguises.

838
00:41:00,992 --> 00:41:03,529
The press will not be there.
The records will be sealed.

839
00:41:03,595 --> 00:41:05,472
Why can't you use
someone else?

840
00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:07,305
You said
there were lots of others.

841
00:41:07,365 --> 00:41:09,572
We can't establish fraud
with the others.

842
00:41:09,634 --> 00:41:10,806
What is it with you people?

843
00:41:10,869 --> 00:41:14,316
You don't think twice about
destroying people's lives?

844
00:41:14,839 --> 00:41:17,820
I sympathize with you, Mr. Brock, and
I think I can keep your privacy.

845
00:41:17,876 --> 00:41:20,083
But even if I can't, so what?

846
00:41:20,945 --> 00:41:24,552
So your parents find out that
Bobby is not your natural child.

847
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:26,729
So Bobby finds out.

848
00:41:27,519 --> 00:41:29,590
There are a lot of
adopted babies in this world.

849
00:41:29,654 --> 00:41:30,928
Their lives
aren't exactly ruined.

850
00:41:30,989 --> 00:41:32,832
You have no idea
what you're talking about.

851
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:34,836
We know
we have to stop Dr. Gilbert.

852
00:41:34,893 --> 00:41:37,965
Doctors?
They're worse than you people.

853
00:41:38,263 --> 00:41:40,743
They think they know what's
good for you, what's right.

854
00:41:40,798 --> 00:41:43,540
They don't know anything.
Clara, be quiet.

855
00:41:44,836 --> 00:41:48,648
Now, you get the hell out of here and
leave us alone. Get out. Get out.

856
00:41:50,008 --> 00:41:51,453
Best-laid plans.

857
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:54,615
Our chances of getting them to
testify are zip, and you saw them.

858
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:58,024
Yes, I did see them. And there's
something else going on there.

859
00:41:58,082 --> 00:42:02,428
"Doctors don't know what's good for us.
They don't know what's right."

860
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,363
What the hell
was that all about?

861
00:42:04,422 --> 00:42:08,029
Gilbert burned them pretty badly. I can
understand her bent for hyperbole.

862
00:42:08,092 --> 00:42:11,505
Somehow I don't think Mrs. Brock
was referring to Dr. Gilbert.

863
00:42:12,664 --> 00:42:13,665
Humor me.

864
00:42:14,299 --> 00:42:16,939
Talk to the doctor
that sent them to Gilbert.

865
00:42:22,073 --> 00:42:24,610
The Brocks are good people. I
just wish I could've helped them.

866
00:42:24,676 --> 00:42:26,849
You sent them to Dr. Gilbert.
They had a baby.

867
00:42:26,911 --> 00:42:28,754
Bobby. Beautiful little boy.

868
00:42:28,813 --> 00:42:30,918
The problem was
their daughter, Debra.

869
00:42:30,982 --> 00:42:33,087
The Brocks have a daughter?
Had.

870
00:42:33,284 --> 00:42:36,322
Died last year. Leukemia.
Eight years old.

871
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:38,025
That's why
I sent them to Gilbert.

872
00:42:38,089 --> 00:42:41,559
If only Bobby's marrow had matched,
maybe I could have done something.

873
00:42:41,626 --> 00:42:44,869
What are you saying? Neither
of the Brocks were a match.

874
00:42:45,029 --> 00:42:48,203
There was a chance that if
they had another child...

875
00:42:48,266 --> 00:42:50,940
Wait a minute. Are you saying the
only reason the Brocks had a baby

876
00:42:51,002 --> 00:42:53,539
was to use his bone marrow
in a transplant?

877
00:42:53,605 --> 00:42:56,677
They were trying to save
their daughter's life.

878
00:42:57,942 --> 00:42:59,979
No wonder
their lips are sealed.

879
00:43:00,344 --> 00:43:02,984
They don't want their son
to discover one day

880
00:43:03,047 --> 00:43:05,084
they only bought him
for the parts.

881
00:43:05,149 --> 00:43:06,253
CLAIRE: This is great.

882
00:43:06,317 --> 00:43:07,990
Gilbert committed
felony larceny,

883
00:43:08,052 --> 00:43:11,363
and we can't make a case because
of his victims' feelings of guilt.

884
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:14,062
We can't make a case for fraud.
How about murder?

885
00:43:14,125 --> 00:43:17,004
Well, legally he's not responsible
for Susan Parker's getting shot.

886
00:43:17,061 --> 00:43:20,838
I'm not talking about Susan Parker. I'm
talking about the Brocks' daughter.

887
00:43:20,898 --> 00:43:22,809
The fact that the father's
sperm was not used

888
00:43:22,867 --> 00:43:25,347
has to have significantly
lowered the possibility

889
00:43:25,403 --> 00:43:27,280
of the baby's marrow
being a match.

890
00:43:27,338 --> 00:43:29,284
Significantly lowered, yeah.

891
00:43:29,374 --> 00:43:30,751
Well, think about it, Adam.

892
00:43:30,808 --> 00:43:31,912
You see a man drowning.

893
00:43:31,976 --> 00:43:34,217
You tell the lifeguard, "Don't
worry about it, I'll save him,"

894
00:43:34,279 --> 00:43:36,623
knowing that you're not
such a good swimmer.

895
00:43:36,681 --> 00:43:38,160
And the man drowns.

896
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:41,593
Reckless disregard.
At best, a long shot.

897
00:43:46,257 --> 00:43:49,101
Have Gilbert come into my
office tomorrow at 9:30.

898
00:43:50,928 --> 00:43:52,339
Murder two.

899
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:54,268
You're on drugs, right?

900
00:43:55,266 --> 00:43:58,008
The Brocks' daughter
might still be alive today

901
00:43:58,369 --> 00:44:00,906
were it not for the reckless
disregard for human life

902
00:44:00,972 --> 00:44:03,350
shown by your client.
That's nonsense.

903
00:44:04,008 --> 00:44:05,316
Even if I used
the father's sperm,

904
00:44:05,376 --> 00:44:06,821
there's no guarantee
of a match.

905
00:44:06,878 --> 00:44:09,415
The statute says
you're guilty if your actions

906
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,482
cause a "grave risk of death."

907
00:44:11,916 --> 00:44:15,989
Your lawyer will explain to you
that that's a matter for the jury.

908
00:44:16,354 --> 00:44:18,595
And I'll parade a dozen
experts into the courtroom

909
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:20,397
to say
there's no cause-in-fact.

910
00:44:20,458 --> 00:44:23,302
It's all the reasonable
doubt I need. Fine.

911
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:27,438
But just consider what will
happen to reasonable doubt

912
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:29,205
when the jury hears

913
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:33,744
how the good doctor here was trying
to populate the world by himself.

914
00:44:34,072 --> 00:44:37,349
What will they think when I
tell them about Susan Parker

915
00:44:37,642 --> 00:44:41,613
lying dead on the floor of a bank
because of one of his little lies?

916
00:44:42,747 --> 00:44:46,559
And how will they actually
react to the news

917
00:44:46,818 --> 00:44:49,958
that the Brocks might not have had to
bury their eight-year-old daughter

918
00:44:50,021 --> 00:44:52,228
were it not
for your client's gall

919
00:44:52,724 --> 00:44:53,725
or ego

920
00:44:55,026 --> 00:44:57,768
or complete disregard
for human decency?

921
00:44:57,862 --> 00:44:59,899
ARONSON: All very persuasive,
Counselor.

922
00:44:59,964 --> 00:45:02,877
You have one slight problem.
You can't testify.

923
00:45:04,569 --> 00:45:06,480
Go ahead. Go to trial.

924
00:45:06,637 --> 00:45:09,618
Without witnesses, they'll
laugh you out of the court.

925
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:11,277
You're a doctor.

926
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:14,786
You're supposed to
help these people.

927
00:45:15,112 --> 00:45:17,353
These women
come to me barren,

928
00:45:18,015 --> 00:45:21,622
starved for the feeling of life
growing inside their bodies.

929
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:24,862
Their husbands can't give it to
them, neither can their lovers.

930
00:45:24,922 --> 00:45:25,923
Just me.

931
00:45:26,157 --> 00:45:29,001
I'm sure your children are
not what they bargained for.

932
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:31,165
I think you'd be surprised.

933
00:45:31,529 --> 00:45:33,440
I think you flatter yourself.

934
00:45:35,299 --> 00:45:37,802
I create something

935
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:40,549
where nothing was before.

936
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:44,649
God doesn't make babies,
Mr. McCoy.

937
00:45:45,109 --> 00:45:46,110
I do.

938
00:45:58,256 --> 00:46:01,203
We might be able
to convince a jury.

939
00:46:01,259 --> 00:46:03,000
And be reversed on appeal.

940
00:46:03,861 --> 00:46:05,898
So, we drop it?
For now.

941
00:46:07,865 --> 00:46:11,677
Do you think we'll ever find someone
who'll testify against him?

942
00:46:12,970 --> 00:46:14,745
Jesus had his Judas.

943
00:46:17,542 --> 00:46:19,283
And he's not Jesus.
