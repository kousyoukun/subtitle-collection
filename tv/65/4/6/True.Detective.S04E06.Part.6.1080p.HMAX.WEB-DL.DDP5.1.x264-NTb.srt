1
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:43,375
Fuck it.

2
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:02,061
Liz Danvers
Do you see anything?!

3
00:01:03,938 --> 00:01:05,440
Is it safe?!

4
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:08,026
It's safe!

5
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:24,041
Okay.

6
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:00,745
You feel it too,

7
00:02:00,746 --> 00:02:02,080
don't you?

8
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:05,792
It's slippery. Careful.

9
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:16,904
Hey... Navarro.

10
00:03:19,387 --> 00:03:21,868
What are
you doin'?

11
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:25,558
It's here.

12
00:03:25,559 --> 00:03:27,623
What? Wait.

13
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:29,375
Where are you goin'?

14
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:31,127
- This way.
- Navarro.

15
00:03:32,211 --> 00:03:33,754
What the...

16
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:35,298
Oh, fuck.

17
00:03:37,508 --> 00:03:39,801
Where you goin'?

18
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:42,096
Navarro?
Oh, fuck.

19
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:45,141
- Navarro?
- It's this way.

20
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:53,024
It's here.

21
00:03:53,858 --> 00:03:57,695
Ah, Jesus.
Damn it. Fuck.

22
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:13,919
No.

23
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:17,673
Let's go back.

24
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:22,095
No, no, no.
It's here.

25
00:04:22,096 --> 00:04:23,098
I know it.

26
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,431
What? That's
a dead end.

27
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:28,267
- Come on.
- Can't you hear it?

28
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:31,186
What?

29
00:04:32,271 --> 00:04:33,856
She's calling.

30
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:36,066
Agh. No, no, no, no, no.

31
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:38,903
- We're, we're gonna go back to the path now.
- Shh. No, no.

32
00:04:38,904 --> 00:04:40,362
I swear to God,
it's here.

33
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:42,699
We're not just gonna walk around
and wait for you...

34
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:48,037
Oh, God!
Are you okay?!

35
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:55,086
- Did you break anything?
- Fuck.

36
00:04:55,087 --> 00:04:56,713
I don't...

37
00:04:57,714 --> 00:05:01,718
- I don't think so.
- Alright, just... stay put.

38
00:05:01,719 --> 00:05:04,408
- Shit. Fuck. The fuck?
- Um...

39
00:05:04,409 --> 00:05:07,098
I'm gonna try
and find some help.

40
00:05:07,099 --> 00:05:08,891
Shit, I'm sorry.

41
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:13,104
You were right.
We should've stayed back.

42
00:05:13,105 --> 00:05:14,855
Shut the fuck up.

43
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:17,900
Just don't do anything st...

44
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,406
- Are you okay?
- Ah, that hurt.

45
00:05:23,407 --> 00:05:25,074
- Yeah.
- Fuck.

46
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:30,038
Oh, man. Fuck.

47
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:31,998
Ah, geez.

48
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,417
Shit, shit, shit.

49
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:39,255
Oh, we're trapped.

50
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:43,300
Clark!

51
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:51,350
See that?

52
00:05:57,899 --> 00:05:59,484
Where the fuck is he?

53
00:06:01,277 --> 00:06:02,320
What is this place?

54
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,834
Clear.

55
00:06:20,254 --> 00:06:21,297
Clear.

56
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:24,926
Where the fuck is he?

57
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:27,762

114
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:48,893
Fuck.

115
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:50,936
Navarro!

116
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:53,564

117
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:55,065
Navarro!

118
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:10,289
Navarro!

119
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:12,833

120
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:55,375
Navarro!

121
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:05,427
No! Navarro.
Hey, hey! No!

122
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:07,011
We need him to talk!

123
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:09,264
No.

124
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:13,769
Fucking blizzard.

125
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,896
There's no Wi-Fi,
there's no radio,

126
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:19,108
and there's no way
we can drive in the storm.

127
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,735
We're stuck out here.

128
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,409
Help me.

129
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,287
G-Get your ass over here
and help me.

130
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:47,344
- Jesus, you scared me.
- Sorry.

131
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:49,972
Is Liz here?

132
00:14:49,973 --> 00:14:50,973
No.

133
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,309
She asked me to come over
for New Year's,

134
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:57,271
I... thought
we could maybe...

135
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:02,985
What are you
doing here?

136
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:05,904
Are you staying here?

137
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:08,991
- Kayla's not gonna like that.
- Liz went out.

138
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:12,327
Out where?
In this?

139
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:14,496
Yeah. It was, uh,
it was an emergency.

140
00:15:14,497 --> 00:15:16,665
Work stuff, ya know?

141
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:20,419
And you're cleaning?

142
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:24,798
Thought I'd make
myself useful.

143
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,300
Is everything okay?

144
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:30,346
Yeah.

145
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:33,103
- What the fuck is going on?
- It's just, um...

146
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:40,731
the whole Kayla thing
has kinda got me messed up.

147
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:45,401
Can I ask
you a favor?

148
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:47,112
Can I drive
you back there?

149
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:53,869
I don't want her and Darwin
to be alone on New Year's Eve.

150
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:57,747
Please.

151
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:00,958
Sure.

152
00:16:03,962 --> 00:16:05,526
Your car's out
in the garage?

153
00:16:05,527 --> 00:16:07,091
No, no.
Uh, it's out front.

154
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,225
- Ah!
- Wake up.

155
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:19,144
Wake up, motherfucker.

156
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:24,942
I'm not talking to you.

157
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:29,863
Hey. Hey, look at me,
you piece of shit.

158
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:32,908
Did you actually
love Annie?

159
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:39,123
Yes.

160
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:41,166
Okay.

161
00:16:46,715 --> 00:16:48,090
Turn that off.

162
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:51,927
Turn that off, please!
Turn it off! I can't...

163
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:54,388
Gimme your headphones.

164
00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:01,847
<i>- My name is Annie Kowtok.</i>
- What are you doing? What?

165
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:05,524
Ooh, ah.

166
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:13,698
No, no. Ow.

167
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:15,534
Please.

168
00:17:16,243 --> 00:17:17,995
Ahh, ah.

169
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:22,832
Please, please,
please, please stop.

170
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:25,002
- Please.
- It's on a loop, motherfucker.

171
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:29,464
- Enjoy.
- No, no.

172
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:32,634
Mm, mm, mm, mm.

173
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:40,767
Want some coffee?

174
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:24,228
What's going on?

175
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:27,272
I didn't want Leah walking back
in the blizzard.

176
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:29,149
Don't fucking lie to me.

177
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:35,656
I have to do something.

178
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,325
I can't tell you
what it is, but...

179
00:18:38,326 --> 00:18:40,243
Is this for Danvers?

180
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:41,994
Did Danvers make you
do something bad?

181
00:18:41,995 --> 00:18:44,435
- Because I swear to God, I will go and...
- Kayla, stop! Stop!

182
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I did it.

183
00:18:51,004 --> 00:18:53,402
Alright?
And I'm fixing it now,

184
00:18:53,403 --> 00:18:55,801
but I need
your help, Kayla.

185
00:18:58,053 --> 00:18:59,304
Look at me.

186
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:09,063
I need to do
this one thing,

187
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:11,817
and then I will
be here with you.

188
00:19:15,153 --> 00:19:17,823
But right now,
I just... I need fucking...

189
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:28,542
Go.

190
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:33,922
Please stay safe...
you hear me?

191
00:19:36,174 --> 00:19:37,217
Asshole.

192
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:03,118
Funyuns?
Really?

193
00:20:04,244 --> 00:20:05,787
Starving.

194
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:08,457
You have any idea
how long it's been since I ate?

195
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:20,010
My mother used
to love oranges.

196
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:23,012
Loved them.

197
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:25,307
She used to peel them
in just one long strip.

198
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,103
Julia too.

199
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:59,216
Prior's fucked
for life, isn't he?

200
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:02,970
Yeah, I don't know.

201
00:21:04,262 --> 00:21:05,305
Maybe.

202
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:08,392
It's crazy,
the shit that we survive.

203
00:21:12,562 --> 00:21:14,898
Think he's ready?

204
00:21:14,899 --> 00:21:18,318
Ah!

205
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:22,239
- Were you there?
- Please.

206
00:21:22,572 --> 00:21:24,157
Were you fucking there?

207
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:27,160
Not at first.

208
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:29,548
But eventually you were?

209
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:33,333
Answer the fucking question.

210
00:21:33,334 --> 00:21:34,333
It's my fault.

211
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:41,862
She found some notes,
just, just scribbles, really,

212
00:21:41,863 --> 00:21:45,929
and she started to piece together
what we were doing.

213
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:48,807
And what were you doing?

214
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:51,976
We were digging
for the DNA

215
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:54,854
of a microorganism
contained in the permafrost

216
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:57,795
- that, that could potentially...
- Save the world.

217
00:21:57,796 --> 00:22:00,736
We know, everybody knows,
except it doesn't work.

218
00:22:00,737 --> 00:22:02,403
No, it did.

219
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:03,800
See, that's what
nobody understands.

220
00:22:03,801 --> 00:22:05,197
We cracked it.
We could actually do it.

221
00:22:05,198 --> 00:22:09,077
What the fuck does that
have to do with Annie?

222
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:15,500
Well, we could do it
because the pollution from the mine

223
00:22:15,501 --> 00:22:18,294
helped soften
the permafrost.

224
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:20,609
Eh, eh, we could
extract the DNA

225
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:22,923
with much less
damage and faster

226
00:22:22,924 --> 00:22:26,260
by, by multiple
of hundreds, thousands.

227
00:22:26,261 --> 00:22:30,098
I see, so you were falsifying
the toxicity numbers

228
00:22:30,099 --> 00:22:31,266
- for Silver Sky Mine.
- No.

229
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:39,191
No, we were pushing
the mine to produce more pollutants.

230
00:22:39,192 --> 00:22:40,880
The more waste
in the water,

231
00:22:40,881 --> 00:22:42,568
the more waste
in the ground,

232
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:44,696
the better the permafrost
was for our work.

233
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:49,826
I know,
but it could've changed the world.

234
00:22:49,827 --> 00:22:51,285
It still could.

235
00:22:51,286 --> 00:22:53,413
And that was worth
killing Annie?

236
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,041
No.

237
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:57,751
No.

238
00:23:00,003 --> 00:23:01,880
Then what happened to her?

239
00:23:01,881 --> 00:23:03,840
I, uh...

240
00:23:05,175 --> 00:23:08,136
God, I didn't even know she was here.
She just...

241
00:23:08,137 --> 00:23:10,513
She must've snuck in.

242
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:13,182
Yeah, I, I, I
think she was just

243
00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:15,851
trying to find
a paper trail

244
00:23:15,852 --> 00:23:18,814
to prove that the mine
were paying us, but,

245
00:23:18,815 --> 00:23:20,565
but she discovered
the truth.

246
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:27,197
She destroyed our work,
all those years, all...

247
00:23:27,198 --> 00:23:29,303
all that potential
to do so much good,

248
00:23:29,304 --> 00:23:31,409
she just, she just
obliterated it.

249
00:23:50,596 --> 00:23:52,347
<i>And Lund...</i>

250
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:56,371
<i>he caught her, and he...
h-he snapped.</i>

251
00:23:56,372 --> 00:23:59,813
Annie, Annie, Annie!

252
00:24:08,196 --> 00:24:09,197
Did you do...

253
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:15,035
Why, you
stupid girl!

254
00:24:15,036 --> 00:24:17,205
No, no!

255
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:19,165
No!

256
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:21,041
No!

257
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:29,384
<i>And then everyone else just
helped him finish the job.</i>

258
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:33,138
But not you?

259
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:39,644
I would never hurt her.

260
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:56,786
I'm so sorry.

261
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:04,794
I'm so sorry.

262
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:08,673
I'm so sorry.
Please forgive me.

263
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:18,057
{\an8}No, no.

264
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:19,892
{\an8}No. Stop, stop, stop, stop.

265
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:22,687
{\an8}- No!
- Stop, stop, stop.

266
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:25,565
{\an8}Please stop!

267
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:34,324
Shh! Stop!

268
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:35,908
Please.

269
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:39,204
Please.

270
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:52,050
<i>So, you didn't touch her?</i>

271
00:25:58,431 --> 00:25:59,933
I loved her.

272
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:03,018
But you don't
understand.

273
00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:06,523
The project
could've saved so many lives.

274
00:26:06,524 --> 00:26:08,899
They stabbed her 32 times.

275
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:12,529
It took two years
to build a new robotic arm

276
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:13,697
and hit a vein down there.

277
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:17,157
If we could finish the work,

278
00:26:17,158 --> 00:26:20,328
then she wouldn't
have died for nothing.

279
00:26:20,329 --> 00:26:22,706
They cut out her tongue.

280
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:25,041
What?

281
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:28,252
That wasn't us.

282
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:31,339
That wasn't us.

283
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:33,632
We, we, we, we called
the mine for help.

284
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:36,678
They, they needed us
to keep covering up their numbers.

285
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:41,057
They sent a cop
to move the body.

286
00:26:41,808 --> 00:26:42,599
He must've cut out
the tongue

287
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:45,353
to-to-to-to send
a warning or something.

288
00:26:45,354 --> 00:26:46,396
I...

289
00:26:51,401 --> 00:26:54,529
Tell me again
that you loved her.

290
00:26:59,617 --> 00:27:00,617
I did.

291
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:08,251
- You're not gonna stop me?
- No.

292
00:27:08,252 --> 00:27:11,045
Please!

293
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:13,423
- Shut the fuck up, motherfucker!
- Please!

294
00:27:38,406 --> 00:27:41,076
- Please! Please.
- Shut the fuck up.

295
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:57,592
You know, I was just
about to do it myself?

296
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:02,055
You were about to kill Clark?

297
00:28:04,307 --> 00:28:05,558
No.

298
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:08,268
Wheeler.

299
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,400
Navarro.

300
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:36,589
I need a break.

301
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:38,526
- Hey.
- Oh, f-fuck.

302
00:29:40,528 --> 00:29:41,528
Lines still down?

303
00:29:42,572 --> 00:29:45,825
Yeah. We're stuck here.

304
00:29:47,785 --> 00:29:50,914
- You good?
- It's a long fucking night.

305
00:29:51,664 --> 00:29:53,833
We still have a job
to finish, Liz.

306
00:29:58,922 --> 00:30:00,757
This fucking storm.

307
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:11,392
What happened
to your buddies?

308
00:30:11,851 --> 00:30:14,187
- Huh?
- It was Annie.

309
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:16,940
She killed 'em.

310
00:30:16,941 --> 00:30:17,941
Oh, Jesus.

311
00:30:20,693 --> 00:30:22,320
What are you saying?

312
00:30:22,737 --> 00:30:26,115
I kept, I kept
seeing her.

313
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:30,787
You know, hearing her voice
more and, and more.

314
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:36,167
I knew she'd come back.

315
00:30:38,044 --> 00:30:40,421
She-She-She's awake.

316
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:45,425
No!

317
00:30:45,426 --> 00:30:48,116
No, please, please, no, no!

318
00:30:48,117 --> 00:30:50,806
<i>I knew
she'd come for us.</i>

319
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:53,101
Hey... Clark.

320
00:30:56,105 --> 00:30:58,210
Clark.

321
00:30:58,211 --> 00:31:00,316
Hey!

322
00:31:00,942 --> 00:31:02,652
Clark!

323
00:31:02,653 --> 00:31:03,777
Clark!

324
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:08,824
Open it!

325
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:13,371
Let me in!

326
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:16,124
Clark! Let me in!

327
00:31:16,125 --> 00:31:18,793
Open it up!

328
00:31:26,092 --> 00:31:28,219
No, no! Please!

329
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:19,395
<i>And I stayed there...
holding the hatch...</i>

<i>Stop.</i>

495
00:52:02,410 --> 00:52:05,872
Um... now I need you
to look away.

496
00:52:06,915 --> 00:52:08,458
No, I wanna see.

497
00:52:09,459 --> 00:52:11,377
You wanna see?

498
00:52:11,378 --> 00:52:12,711
How I cut
your father

499
00:52:12,712 --> 00:52:14,548
to let the air
out of his lungs

500
00:52:14,549 --> 00:52:16,675
so he doesn't float?

501
00:52:42,742 --> 00:52:44,035
Okay.

502
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:53,461
You need to put him
in the water yourself.

503
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:57,883
Finish what you started.

504
00:52:59,509 --> 00:53:00,509
Close the door.

505
00:54:32,185 --> 00:54:34,562
I guess you're
thinking...

506
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:39,234
the worst part
is done.

507
00:54:41,361 --> 00:54:44,197
Mm, it's not.

508
00:54:50,537 --> 00:54:52,330
What comes after...

509
00:54:56,084 --> 00:54:57,377
forever...

510
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:05,719
that's the worst
fuckin' part.

511
00:55:33,496 --> 00:55:35,331
The storm's over.
We can go now.

512
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:42,255
Here...
It'll warm you up.

513
00:55:54,371 --> 00:55:56,644
Happy New Year, Navarro.

514
00:56:01,316 --> 00:56:02,358
Happy New Years, Danvers.

515
00:56:09,324 --> 00:56:12,702
You told me
back then that...

516
00:56:13,578 --> 00:56:16,456
you wanted to do it,
ya know, just...

517
00:56:17,123 --> 00:56:20,543
walk out and disappear.

518
00:56:21,795 --> 00:56:24,755
Well, if...

519
00:56:24,756 --> 00:56:26,758
if you do it,
if you...

520
00:56:27,884 --> 00:56:29,385
if you decide to

521
00:56:33,681 --> 00:56:35,767
just try to come
back, okay?

522
00:56:51,741 --> 00:56:54,410
You know that,
that thing Clark said about...

523
00:56:56,162 --> 00:56:58,164
holdin' his hatch...

524
00:56:58,665 --> 00:57:00,750
bein' down there
in the dark?

525
00:57:03,211 --> 00:57:05,338
I've been feelin'
that way for so long.

526
00:57:09,342 --> 00:57:10,677
Holdin' the hatch...

527
00:57:12,053 --> 00:57:15,515
fuckin' terrified
of the one tryin' to open it.

528
00:57:19,727 --> 00:57:21,229
I was so wrong.

529
00:57:24,315 --> 00:57:25,608
What did you say?

530
00:57:28,778 --> 00:57:29,778
That I was wrong?

531
00:57:31,114 --> 00:57:33,199
No, holdin' the hatch.

532
00:57:51,801 --> 00:57:53,845
- What are you doin'?
- There's a UV light over there.

533
00:57:53,846 --> 00:57:54,888
Go get it.

534
00:58:02,562 --> 00:58:03,813
Come on.

535
00:58:07,609 --> 00:58:11,112
- What are we lookin' for?
- I don't know.

536
00:58:11,113 --> 00:58:12,572
He said,
"holding the hatch."

537
00:58:16,659 --> 00:58:17,785
Danvers.

538
00:58:32,592 --> 00:58:35,011
We weren't asking
the right question.

539
00:58:36,721 --> 00:58:40,433
<i>The question isn't
who killed Annie K.</i>

540
00:58:41,851 --> 00:58:44,687
<i>But who knows
who killed her?</i>

541
00:59:40,285 --> 00:59:44,747
Coming! Jesus,
it's a little fuckin' early.

542
00:59:48,751 --> 00:59:50,295
Beatrice Malee...

543
00:59:51,713 --> 00:59:52,713
and Blair Hartman...

544
00:59:54,632 --> 00:59:55,300
we need to ask
you some questions

545
00:59:55,301 --> 00:59:57,614
about some
physical evidence

546
00:59:57,615 --> 00:59:59,928
that pertains
to the death

547
00:59:59,929 --> 01:00:02,390
of the seven men
at Tsalal Station.

548
01:00:03,224 --> 01:00:06,101
Who wants
to discuss it?

549
01:00:06,102 --> 01:00:10,440
I'm Elizabeth Danvers,
Chief of Ennis Police.

550
01:00:10,441 --> 01:00:11,356
This is my partner.

551
01:00:11,357 --> 01:00:15,570
I am Evangeline
Siqinnaatchiaq Navarro.

552
01:00:18,573 --> 01:00:22,744
My Aaka's name
was Siqinnaatchiaq.

553
01:00:24,662 --> 01:00:26,289
Do you know
what it means?

554
01:00:29,042 --> 01:00:33,463
It means the return of the sun
after the long darkness.

555
01:00:46,351 --> 01:00:49,479
<i>Right, so...
the Tsalal men.</i>

556
01:00:50,104 --> 01:00:51,731
Those fuckers
killed Annie K.

557
01:00:54,233 --> 01:00:55,233
You knew...

558
01:00:56,486 --> 01:00:59,154
- all along.
- No.

559
01:00:59,155 --> 01:01:02,825
For six years, we thought
it was the mine, the town.

560
01:01:04,702 --> 01:01:06,621
To shut her up,
to shut everyone up.

561
01:01:09,832 --> 01:01:13,920
And then... we understood.

562
01:01:15,588 --> 01:01:17,423
Damn.

563
01:01:46,536 --> 01:01:48,162
<i>Why didn't you report it?</i>

564
01:01:49,330 --> 01:01:52,583
To you, the cops?

565
01:01:54,210 --> 01:01:56,504
That would
change nothing.

566
01:01:59,132 --> 01:02:03,594
It's always the same story
with the same ending.

567
01:02:04,262 --> 01:02:06,806
Nothin' ever happens.

568
01:02:07,348 --> 01:02:11,602
So... we told ourselves
a different story,

569
01:02:11,603 --> 01:02:12,895
with a different ending.

570
01:02:20,903 --> 01:02:22,989
How does
this story go?

571
01:02:44,802 --> 01:02:46,095
Clark!

572
01:02:48,639 --> 01:02:51,245
Down!

573
01:02:51,246 --> 01:02:53,853
Please! No, no, no! No!

574
01:03:09,785 --> 01:03:13,164
In this story...
you killed the men?

575
01:03:14,457 --> 01:03:16,292
Honey, they did it
to themselves.

576
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:22,339
<i>When they dug
in her home in the ice,</i>

577
01:03:22,340 --> 01:03:24,467
<i>when they killed
her daughter in there...</i>

578
01:03:31,099 --> 01:03:33,559
<i>they woke her up.</i>

579
01:03:50,493 --> 01:03:52,203
Get out of the truck!

580
01:03:53,996 --> 01:03:54,287
Now!

581
01:03:58,084 --> 01:04:00,398
What do you want? Why?

582
01:04:00,399 --> 01:04:02,713
Take your clothes off!

583
01:04:03,589 --> 01:04:06,217
Take your fucking
clothes off!

584
01:04:13,224 --> 01:04:15,184
Wait, wait!
What are you doing?

585
01:04:15,768 --> 01:04:16,768
Hey!

586
01:04:16,894 --> 01:04:18,187
Down!

587
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:22,400
<i>If she wanted them,
she would take them.</i>

588
01:04:25,778 --> 01:04:26,778
Go!

589
01:04:29,198 --> 01:04:30,238
- Go!
- Please don't shoot.

590
01:04:30,533 --> 01:04:34,245
<i>And if not, their clothes
were there for them.</i>

591
01:04:36,247 --> 01:04:38,958
<i>They'd be half-frozen,
but they'd survive.</i>

592
01:04:45,423 --> 01:04:48,551
<i>But they didn't, though.</i>

593
01:04:50,303 --> 01:04:53,180
<i>I guess she wanted
to take them.</i>

594
01:04:55,850 --> 01:04:59,687
<i>I guess she ate their fuckin' dreams
from the inside out</i>

595
01:04:59,688 --> 01:05:03,816
<i>and spit their frozen bones.</i>

596
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:11,740
But...

597
01:05:13,534 --> 01:05:14,827
it's just a story.

598
01:05:36,599 --> 01:05:40,895
So, Siqinnaatchiaq...

599
01:05:43,606 --> 01:05:45,650
what will it be?

600
01:05:59,393 --> 01:06:02,333
Stories are stories.

601
01:06:10,341 --> 01:06:14,387
We just swung by
to inform you, um...

602
01:06:14,388 --> 01:06:17,263
that the forensics
came back.

603
01:06:17,264 --> 01:06:19,892
Cause of death was
a slab avalanche.

604
01:06:21,268 --> 01:06:23,646
This case is
officially closed.

605
01:06:25,398 --> 01:06:26,940
Thought you'd
wanna know,

606
01:06:26,941 --> 01:06:29,110
seeing as they were
your employers and all.

607
01:06:36,242 --> 01:06:37,743
Happy New Year,

608
01:06:37,744 --> 01:06:40,454
Miss Hartman,
Miss Malee.

609
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:10,401
In your story,
Annie's tongue...

610
01:07:10,402 --> 01:07:11,401
who left it at Tsalal?

611
01:07:13,362 --> 01:07:14,989
That's not part
of our story.

612
01:07:17,116 --> 01:07:19,076
You didn't leave it there?

613
01:07:19,493 --> 01:07:22,371
I don't know what
you're talkin' about.

614
01:07:55,070 --> 01:07:58,281
Alright.

615
01:07:58,282 --> 01:08:01,243
Let's start with the disappearance
of Officer Henry D. Prior

616
01:08:01,244 --> 01:08:04,163
on December 31st
of last year.

617
01:08:04,789 --> 01:08:07,165
That's an ongoing investigation.

618
01:08:07,166 --> 01:08:10,544
So the body of a local
vagrant, Otis Heiss,

619
01:08:10,545 --> 01:08:13,922
was found in the trunk
of Hank Prior's car.

620
01:08:13,923 --> 01:08:17,343
Ballistics showed that the bullet
had been fired from Hank's gun.

621
01:08:17,344 --> 01:08:19,011
But you were the one
who checked Mr. Heiss

622
01:08:19,012 --> 01:08:21,763
out of The Lighthouse
Rehabilitation Center

623
01:08:21,764 --> 01:08:24,683
- on the day of his death.
- Yep. That's correct.

624
01:08:24,684 --> 01:08:26,976
Mr. Heiss had
some information

625
01:08:26,977 --> 01:08:29,562
about the whereabouts
of Raymond Clark.

626
01:08:29,563 --> 01:08:34,318
Um, surveillance footage
from The Lighthouse showed that Hank,

627
01:08:34,319 --> 01:08:37,571
Officer Prior,
was watching my car.

628
01:08:38,614 --> 01:08:40,616
So, um...

629
01:08:41,784 --> 01:08:45,203
it's possible
that he followed us,

630
01:08:45,204 --> 01:08:47,665
and he approached
Mr. Heiss after we separated.

631
01:08:48,415 --> 01:08:51,836
My best guess is it
was a, a deal gone bad.

632
01:08:52,628 --> 01:08:56,548
Mr. Heiss got shot
and Hank,

633
01:08:56,549 --> 01:08:57,883
Officer Prior, when he went
to dispose of the body,

634
01:08:57,884 --> 01:09:02,179
suffered some accident
in the blizzard.

635
01:09:03,305 --> 01:09:05,140
You know, come summer,
we'll find him.

636
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:08,102
We always do...

637
01:09:09,186 --> 01:09:10,729
unless we don't.

638
01:09:14,191 --> 01:09:16,026
Young Officer Prior...

639
01:09:16,652 --> 01:09:19,654
Pete was Hank's son.

640
01:09:19,655 --> 01:09:22,366
He was out lookin' for us
that night in the storm.

641
01:09:23,117 --> 01:09:24,797
I'm sure you read
about that in the report.

642
01:09:24,952 --> 01:09:27,245
Don't you find it
odd that Clark died

643
01:09:27,246 --> 01:09:29,540
in the exact same manner
as the Tsalal men?

644
01:09:30,541 --> 01:09:32,293
Yes.

645
01:09:33,669 --> 01:09:36,045
Incredibly odd.

646
01:09:36,046 --> 01:09:40,759
But... some questions
just don't have answers.

647
01:09:42,386 --> 01:09:46,849
What about Trooper Navarro?
What happened to her?

648
01:09:50,936 --> 01:09:54,899
Well, some people come
to Alaska to escape, ya know?

649
01:09:59,069 --> 01:10:01,133
<i>Get away from something.</i>

650
01:10:05,701 --> 01:10:06,952
Navarro?

651
01:10:09,580 --> 01:10:11,582
Navarro?

652
01:10:45,366 --> 01:10:48,619
Hey, boy. Hey, hey, hey.
Do you want some?

653
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:59,171
<i>Sometimes they come here
lookin' for something.</i>

654
01:11:08,013 --> 01:11:10,599
<i>Sometimes they find it.</i>

655
01:11:42,172 --> 01:11:44,258
<i>Okay. Go.</i>

656
01:11:44,259 --> 01:11:46,217
<i>Uh...</i>

657
01:11:46,218 --> 01:11:48,095
<i>My name is Raymond Clark.</i>

658
01:11:48,804 --> 01:11:50,764
<i>I worked at the Tsalal
Research Station</i>

659
01:11:50,765 --> 01:11:52,725
<i>in Ennis, Alaska,
for 15 years.</i>

660
01:11:52,726 --> 01:11:55,352
<i>This is the truth.</i>

661
01:11:56,311 --> 01:12:00,441
<i>I am profoundly sorry for
the part I played in this.</i>

662
01:12:01,275 --> 01:12:04,695
<i>Pollution levels
in the region are 11 times higher</i>

663
01:12:04,696 --> 01:12:05,611
<i>than those
currently acceptable</i>

664
01:12:05,612 --> 01:12:09,240
<i>by the Vienna Convention
and the UNFCCC.</i>

665
01:12:09,241 --> 01:12:13,745
<i>The pollution knowingly
created by Silver Sky</i>

666
01:12:13,746 --> 01:12:18,375
<i>has caused cancer,
stillbirths, birth defects,</i>

667
01:12:18,376 --> 01:12:19,334
<i>and irreparable
genetic damage</i>

668
01:12:19,335 --> 01:12:23,589
<i>to both the human
and animal population...</i>

669
01:12:25,466 --> 01:12:27,342
<i>Have you seen
the Clark video?</i>

670
01:12:29,595 --> 01:12:33,264
<i>Everybody's seen
the Clark video.</i>

671
01:12:33,265 --> 01:12:36,560
Do you have any idea
who leaked that video?

672
01:12:36,561 --> 01:12:38,896
No... No idea.

673
01:12:39,855 --> 01:12:41,273
Does it matter?

674
01:12:41,940 --> 01:12:45,277
How do you plan on
dealing with political unrest in Ennis?

675
01:12:45,278 --> 01:12:48,280
Well... political unrest
is not my job.

676
01:12:50,532 --> 01:12:54,244
Eh, this town was here
long before the mine,

677
01:12:54,245 --> 01:12:55,371
long before the APF.

678
01:12:57,748 --> 01:13:00,667
Long before Alaska
was even named Alaska.

679
01:13:01,877 --> 01:13:04,295
I'm just gonna show up,

680
01:13:04,296 --> 01:13:07,299
do my job every day
like I always do.

681
01:13:08,258 --> 01:13:09,843
What else is there?

682
01:13:11,345 --> 01:13:12,721
Anything else?

683
01:13:13,472 --> 01:13:16,975
So, you have no theories
about what happened to Trooper Navarro?

684
01:13:27,486 --> 01:13:29,363
<i>Well, let's put it this way.</i>

685
01:13:32,199 --> 01:13:35,494
{\an8}<i>I don't think you'll find Evangeline Navarro
out there on the ice.</i>

686
01:13:55,347 --> 01:13:58,642
<i>So, those reports
of sightings of her...</i>

687
01:13:58,643 --> 01:13:59,642
<i>they may be true?</i>

688
01:14:03,272 --> 01:14:06,108
<i>Well, this is Ennis.</i>

689
01:14:12,281 --> 01:14:14,366
<i>Nobody ever really leaves.</i>
