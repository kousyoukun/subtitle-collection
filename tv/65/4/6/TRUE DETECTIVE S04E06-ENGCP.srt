1
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,200
Fuck it.

2
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,160
Do you see anything?

3
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:01,720
Is it safe?

4
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,520
It's safe.

5
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,080
Okay.

6
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,920
You feel it too, don't you?

7
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,520
It's slippery. Careful.

8
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,400
Hey, Navarro?

9
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,720
What are you doing?

10
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,680
It's here.

11
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,080
What?

12
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,440
Wait.

13
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,760
Where are you going?

14
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,920
- This way.
- Navarro!

15
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,880
What the...

16
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,600
Oh, fuck.

17
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,080
Where you going?

18
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,240
Navarro?

19
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,640
Fuck.

20
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,600
Navarro.

21
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,080
It's this way.

22
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,920
It's here.

23
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,600
Jesus. Damn it. Fuck.

24
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,760
No.

25
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:06,880
Let's go back.

26
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,480
No...

27
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,680
It's here, I know it.

28
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,160
What? That's a dead end.

29
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,080
Come on.

30
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,200
Can't you hear it?

31
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,480
What?

32
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,760
She's calling.

33
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,200
No...

34
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,440
We're... we're gonna go back
to the path. Now.

35
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,280
No, I swear to God, it's here.

36
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,400
We're not just gonna walk around
and wait for you...

37
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,960
Oh, god! Are you okay?

38
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,800
Well, did you break anything?

39
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,200
Fuck. I don't...

40
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,080
I don't think so.

41
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,760
All right. Just... stay put.

42
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,760
Shit. Fuck.

43
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,520
- Fuck.
- I'm gonna try and find some help.

44
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,360
Shit! I'm sorry.

45
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,400
You were right.

46
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,880
- We should have stayed back.
- Shut the fuck up.

47
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,760
Just don't do anything...

48
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,240
Fuck...

49
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,920
- Oh, that hurt.
- Are you okay?

50
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,880
- Yeah.
- Fuck.

51
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,800
Oh, man.

52
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,400
Fuck.

53
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,000
Oh, geez.

54
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,960
Shit...

55
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,640
We're trapped.

56
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,360
Clark!

57
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,480
See that?

58
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,720
Where the fuck is he?

59
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,040
What is this place?

60
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,440
Clear!

61
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,160
Clear.

62
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,000
Where the fuck is he?

63
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,400
Navarro.

64
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,080
There has to be another exit.

65
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,040
Navarro.

66
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,160
Star-shaped wound.

67
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,640
Where the fuck is he?

68
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,800
Danvers.

69
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,000
Motherfucker.

70
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,440
For fuck's sake.

71
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,880
Shut the fuck up!

72
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,640
Let me out!

73
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Fuck!

74
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,840
Navarro!

75
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:20,880
Navarro!

76
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,520
Navarro!

77
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,080
Navarro!

78
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:39,920
Shit.

79
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,280
Navarro!

80
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,800
No! Navarro!

81
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,160
Hey, hey... No.

82
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,040
We need him to talk!

83
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,080
No.

84
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,840
Fucking blizzard.

85
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,120
There's no Wi-Fi. There's no radio.

86
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,280
And there's no way
we can drive in this storm.

87
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,080
We're stuck out here.

88
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,160
Help me.

89
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,760
Get... get your ass over here
and help me.

90
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,120
Jesus. You scared me!

91
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,200
Sorry.

92
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,480
Is Liz here?

93
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
No.

94
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,360
She asked me to come over
for New Year's.

95
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,360
I thought we could maybe...

96
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,160
What are you doing here?

97
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:27,720
Are you staying here?

98
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,120
Kayla's not gonna like that.

99
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,240
Liz went out.

100
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,120
Out where? In this?

101
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:38,720
Yeah, it was a... it was an emergency
at-work stuff, you know?

102
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,560
And you're cleaning?

103
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,920
Thought I'd make myself useful.

104
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,840
Is everything okay?

105
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:51,680
Yeah.

106
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,840
What the fuck is going on?

107
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,000
It's just...

108
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,120
It... The whole Kayla thing
has kinda got me messed up.

109
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,680
Can I ask you a favor?

110
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,360
Can I drive you back there?

111
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:13,960
I don't want her and Darwin
to be alone on New Year's Eve.

112
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Please?

113
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,040
Sure.

114
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:27,360
- Your car's out in the garage?
- No. No, it's out front.

115
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,280
Wake up.

116
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,080
Wake up, motherfucker!

117
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,320
I'm not talking to you.

118
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:48,240
Hey. Hey, look at me,
you piece of shit.

119
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,320
Did you actually love Annie?

120
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:57,760
Yes.

121
00:15:58,680 --> 00:15:59,680
Okay.

122
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:05,560
<i>- It's here. I found it...</i>
- Turn that off.

123
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,800
Turn that off, please!

124
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,720
Turn that off! I can't... I...

125
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,520
- Give me your headphones.
- Please, please.

126
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,800
<i>- My name is Annie Kowtok.</i>
- What are you doing? What...

127
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:29,880
No, no.

128
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,520
Please.

129
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:39,720
Please... stop.

130
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,480
- Please...
- It's on a loop, motherfucker.

131
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,080
- Enjoy.
- No, no!

132
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,240
Want some coffee?

133
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,720
No!

134
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,040
What's going on?

135
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,376
I didn't want Leah
walking back in the blizzard.

136
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,840
Don't fucking lie to me.

137
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,800
I have to do something.

138
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,920
I can't tell you what it is, but...

139
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,200
Is this for Danvers?

140
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,520
Did Danvers
make you do something bad?

141
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,440
- Because I swear to God...
- Kayla, stop! Stop!

142
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,240
I did it.

143
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,280
All right?

144
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:08,320
And I'm fixing it now.
But I need your help, Kayla.

145
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:11,880
Look at me.

146
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:23,680
I need to do this one thing,
and then I will be here with you.

147
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,280
But right now,
I just... I need fucking...

148
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,280
Go.

149
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,880
Please stay safe, you hear me?

150
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,440
Asshole.

151
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,160
Funyuns?

152
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,600
Really?

153
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,640
I'm starving.

154
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,440
You have any idea
how long it's been since I ate?

155
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,600
My mother used to love oranges.

156
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,040
Loved them.

157
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,760
She used to peel 'em
in just one long strip.

158
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:38,800
Julia, too.

159
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,520
Prior's fucked for life, isn't he?

160
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,160
Yeah. I don't know.

161
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,800
Maybe.

162
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,160
It's crazy, the shit we survive.

163
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:20,880
Think he's ready?

164
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:27,760
Were you there?

165
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,320
Please.

166
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,720
Were you fucking there?

167
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:33,920
Not at first.

168
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,800
But eventually, you were?

169
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,680
- Answer the fucking question.
- It was my fault.

170
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,120
She found some notes.

171
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:48,960
Just... just scribbles, really

172
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,640
and she started to piece together
what we were doing.

173
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,920
And what were you doing?

174
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,880
We were digging
for the DNA of a microorganism

175
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,440
contained in the permafrost

176
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,640
that could potentially...

177
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,640
Save the world. We know.
Everybody knows.

178
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,120
Except it doesn't work.

179
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,200
No, it did.

180
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,176
See, that's what nobody understands.
We cracked it.

181
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,520
We could actually do it.

182
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,400
What the fuck does that
have to do with Annie?

183
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,200
Well, we could do it...

184
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:22,320
because the pollution from the mine
helped soften the permafrost.

185
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,640
It... We could extract the DNA
with much less damage

186
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:29,800
and faster by...
by multiple of hundreds.

187
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,760
- Thousands.
- I see.

188
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:35,360
So, you were falsifying the toxicity
numbers for Silver Sky Mine.

189
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,440
No.

190
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:42,400
No, we were pushing the mine
to produce more pollutants.

191
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,280
The more waste in the water,
the more waste in the ground

192
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:48,600
the better the permafrost
was for our work.

193
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,640
I know, but it could've
changed the world.

194
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,520
It still could.

195
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,240
And that was worth killing Annie.

196
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,360
No. No.

197
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:03,960
Then what happened to her?

198
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,280
I...

199
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,440
I didn't even know she was here.

200
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,840
She just... she must have snuck in.

201
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:18,160
I... think she was just trying
to find a paper trail

202
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,920
to prove that the mine were paying us

203
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,360
but... but she discovered the truth.

204
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,320
She destroyed our work.

205
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,720
All those years, all...

206
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,920
all that potential
to do so much good.

207
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,560
She just... just obliterated it.

208
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:54,680
And Lund, he caught her, and he...

209
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,960
he snapped.

210
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:01,000
Stop! Annie...

211
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,440
Did you do...

212
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,360
Why, you stupid girl!

213
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,160
No!

214
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,680
No!

215
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,240
And everyone else just helped him
finish the job.

216
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,160
But not you?

217
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,160
I would never hurt her.

218
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,520
I'm so sorry.

219
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,240
I'm so sorry.

220
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,040
I'm so sorry. Please forgive me.

221
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,160
No, stop...

222
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,920
- No! Get off me!
- Stop, stop!

223
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,760
- Stop! Please stop!
- Get off!

224
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,760
Stop!

225
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,680
Please.

226
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,360
Please.

227
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,760
So, you didn't touch her?

228
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,160
I loved her.

229
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,560
But you don't understand.

230
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,880
The project could have
saved so many lives.

231
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:04,080
They stabbed her 32 times.

232
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:07,600
It took two years to build
a new robotic arm

233
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,240
and hit a vein down there.

234
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,960
If we could finish the work

235
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,880
then she wouldn't have died
for nothing.

236
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,720
They cut out her tongue.

237
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,440
What?

238
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:22,880
That wasn't us.

239
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,200
That wasn't us.

240
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,760
We... called the mine for help.

241
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:30,920
They... They needed us
to keep covering up their numbers.

242
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,920
They sent a cop to move the body.

243
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,256
He must have cut out the tongue

244
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,600
to... send a warning
or something. I...

245
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,320
Tell me again that you loved her.

246
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:53,800
I did.

247
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,280
You're not gonna stop me?

248
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:01,760
No.

249
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,720
- No! Please!
- Shut the fuck up, motherfucker!

250
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:05,800
Please!

251
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,520
- Please!
- Shut up!

252
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:32,400
- Please! Please!
- Shut the fuck up!

253
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,160
You know,
I was just about to do it myself.

254
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,240
You were about to kill Clark?

255
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:55,760
No.

256
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,640
Wheeler.

257
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,240
Navarro!

258
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,160
I need a break.

259
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:23,840
Hey.

260
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,240
Lines still down?

261
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,160
Yeah, we're stuck here.

262
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,160
You good?

263
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,920
It's a long fucking night.

264
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,440
We still have a job to finish, Liz.

265
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,040
This fucking storm.

266
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,200
What happened to your buddies?

267
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:58,920
It was Annie.

268
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,080
She killed them.

269
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:03,960
Jesus.

270
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,560
What are you saying?

271
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:10,480
I kept... I kept seeing her.

272
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:15,200
You know, hearing her voice
more and... and more.

273
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:19,800
I knew she'd come back.

274
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,000
She... she's awake.

275
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:28,920
Clark!

276
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:32,480
No! Please... No! No!

277
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,080
<i>I knew she'd come for us.</i>

278
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,400
- No!
- Hey!

279
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,120
Clark!

280
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:38,920
What's... what's...

281
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,440
Clark!

282
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,480
Hey!

283
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,640
Clark!

284
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:46,960
Clark!

285
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,720
Oh, no, no, Clark! Clark!

286
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,280
Open it!

287
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,000
Let me in!

288
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,880
Clark! Clark, can you hear me?

289
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,800
Open it up!

290
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,120
Help!

291
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,520
No!

292
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,600
Please!

293
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,440
Fuck!

294
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:59,000
I stayed there, holding the hatch.

295
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,160
For an hour.

296
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,320
Or a week.

297
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:12,080
He was right there under our feet
the whole time we were searching.

298
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,920
What happened
to those men on the ice?

299
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,800
Annie killed them.

300
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,000
Did you see them die?

301
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:23,320
I didn't leave the cave.
I was too afraid.

302
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,040
But you did come up.

303
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,440
It was you the supply guy saw,
wasn't it?

304
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:28,640
Yeah, I was hungry.

305
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,040
Yeah. And you found Otis Heiss.

306
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Right?

307
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:38,800
I wanted to know how to survive her.

308
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:42,080
Otis Heiss didn't survive Annie.

309
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,920
She wasn't even born
when he was injured.

310
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:48,480
She's been hiding
in those caves forever.

311
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,520
- And before she was born.
- Jesus.

312
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:51,800
After we all die.

313
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:54,320
Time is a flat circle...

314
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:59,400
and we are all stuck in it.

315
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:01,520
Don't let him sleep.

316
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,200
He'll talk.

317
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,040
I got all night.

318
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,120
Please.

319
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:18,480
Please, I'm so tired.

320
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:20,920
Just do it.

321
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,000
Or let me do it.

322
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:25,840
Please.

323
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,280
Please.

324
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:46,160
<i>Shake it up baby</i>

325
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,320
I see you.

326
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,640
<i>- Twist and shout...
- Mommy!</i>

327
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:09,680
Navarro?

328
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:15,800
Navarro?

329
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:35,920
Navarro!

330
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:38,880
Navarro!

331
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,520
What did you do?

332
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,640
He's dead!

333
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:54,240
He's dead, Danvers!

334
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:58,160
Fuck!

335
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,000
Fuck!

336
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,680
You let him fucking go.

337
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:11,680
You saw him. You knew
he was gonna commit suicide

338
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:12,880
and you just let him do it.

339
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,360
What, did you cut the power, too?

340
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,400
I didn't cut the power.

341
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,520
Seriously!

342
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:25,760
That frozen motherfucker out there
is the only witness we had!

343
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:28,680
The fuck, Navarro?

344
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,320
We're gonna fucking freeze
in here just like him.

345
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,480
There has to be
an emergency generator.

346
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,560
I'll go find it.

347
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,760
Come on, come on.

348
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:55,880
Fuck!

349
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,800
Fuck, fuck's sake.

350
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,560
Fuck.

351
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:34,520
<i>Evangeline...</i>

352
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,080
<i>Stop.</i>

353
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,640
She's awake.

354
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:22,720
<i>They say, try not to travel
in this weather.</i>

355
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,280
<i>This is KDRK, Ennis radio</i>

356
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:27,080
<i>wishing you a happy, stormy New Year</i>

358
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,040
For Christ's sake, come in.

359
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:48,000
What the hell are you doing here?

360
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:49,680
Navarro sent me.

361
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:55,520
She says take me to where Julia is.

362
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:02,120
I got someone who's going to
the same place, Rose.

363
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,880
It's going to be
one of those nights, isn't it?

364
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:18,160
I knew it.

365
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,800
We should never have
touched this case.

366
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,200
Hey. What are you doing?

367
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:31,560
- Nothing.
- Navarro.

368
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:39,600
There is something out there.
Calling me.

369
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:40,960
Don't fucking start.

370
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,120
You need to know something.

371
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:43,760
Stop.

372
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:48,200
There... There's...
There is more than this, Liz.

373
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:52,000
There is so much more than just this.

374
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:57,440
And it can be...
it can be a comfort, you know?

375
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:02,040
- Julia wasn't wrong.
- Julia gave up!

376
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,440
All right, I know she's your sister,
but Julia quit.

377
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:16,920
You know...

378
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:20,240
he doesn't really look like you

379
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:23,480
but there's something in his eyes.

380
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:28,080
What?

381
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:33,600
Holden.

382
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:39,040
- Shut up.
- He's out there, Liz.

383
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,720
- And he said that, he said...
- Shut the fuck up!

384
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,680
You don't say his name.

385
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,720
You hear me?
You shut your mouth!

386
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,560
You don't know.

387
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:55,960
When he was trapped in that car.

388
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:00,680
Was he scared? Was he hurt?

389
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,520
Was he screaming "Mommy?"

390
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:14,480
You don't come here
and tell me "he said."

391
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:21,720
Or I will... I will shoot your sick
fucking mouth right off your face.

392
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:25,320
You wanna go out there and die?

393
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:31,040
You wanna follow your ghosts
and curl up in a ball

394
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:32,816
and die out on the ice out there,
you go ahead.

395
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:34,720
But you leave my kid out of it!

396
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:38,360
Or I will rip you apart.

397
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,320
I am not merciful.

398
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:45,800
You understand?

399
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:49,280
I got no mercy left.

400
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,840
<i>Elizabeth Danvers. Leave a message.</i>

401
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:07,120
Liz?

402
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:10,680
It's me again.

403
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:14,400
Just call me back, okay?

404
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:21,360
Hey, just don't die out there
or anything.

405
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:24,560
Please.

406
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:07,080
Fuck.

407
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:16,320
Navarro?

408
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:55,080
Navarro!

409
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:04,480
Navarro!

410
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:07,840
Where are you?

411
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:17,640
Navarro!

412
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:40,120
Listen.

413
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:48,800
Navarro!

414
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:58,760
Come, Evangeline.

415
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:08,480
Siqiññaatchiaq...

416
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:18,480
Your name is Siqiññaatchiaq.

417
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:23,840
Navarro!

418
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:30,680
Mommy!

419
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:34,680
Mommy!

420
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:40,120
Mommy!

421
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:42,880
Holden!

422
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,120
Mommy!

423
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:41,600
Hey, come on.

424
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:44,160
Stay with me, Liz. Come on.

425
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:49,720
Hey, you got to breathe.
Come on. You got to breathe.

426
00:46:57,720 --> 00:46:59,800
Stay with me, come on!

427
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:00,880
Liz!

428
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:03,360
Hey, hey, come on, breathe.

429
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:05,320
- You got to breathe. I know.
- I'm so, so cold.

430
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:07,040
I know it's so fucking cold.

431
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:09,400
I know. You gotta stay.
Come on, Liz.

432
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:14,160
Breathe, you gotta breathe.

433
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:15,960
Come on, in and out.

434
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:18,320
Blow out like a birthday candle,
come on.

435
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:21,840
- Yes! Oh, my gosh!
- Yay!

436
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:26,160
There you go, good. Again, in, out.

437
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:27,760
Come on, Liz, there you go.

438
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:30,680
Again, can you do that again for me?
Breathe. Breathe.

439
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:40,120
Liz, come on. Hey, hey.

440
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:42,120
Don't make me kick
your skinny ass, come on.

441
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:43,680
Keep breathing. Keep breathing.

442
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:45,360
Hey, you there?

443
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:48,720
Hey...

444
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:51,560
Hi, hi.

445
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:58,040
What did he say?

446
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:01,000
What?

447
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:03,080
What did he say?

448
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:05,760
Who?

449
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,200
Holden.

450
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:17,400
He says that...

451
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:20,080
he sees you.

452
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:23,960
He sees you, Liz.

453
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:39,840
Holden.

454
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:07,560
It's all right. It's okay.

455
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:10,800
It's okay.

456
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:35,800
That's it.

457
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:38,000
Stop.

458
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:43,720
Stop.

459
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:56,960
Now, I need you to look away.

460
00:49:58,240 --> 00:49:59,320
No, I want to see.

461
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:03,800
You want to see how I cut your father

462
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:06,760
to let the air out of his lungs
so he doesn't float?

463
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:33,680
Okay.

464
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:42,400
You need to put him
in the water yourself.

465
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:46,600
Finish what you started.

466
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:49,720
Close the door.

467
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:19,200
I guess you're thinking...

468
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:23,800
the worst part is done.

469
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:29,120
It's not.

470
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:36,480
What comes after.

471
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:41,560
Forever.

472
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:49,640
That's the worst fucking part.

473
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:17,600
The storm's over.

474
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:19,280
We can go now.

475
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:22,720
Here.

476
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:24,560
It'll warm you up.

477
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:38,600
Happy New Year, Navarro.

478
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:44,520
Happy New Years, Danvers.

479
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:56,360
You told me back then
that you wanted to do it.

480
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:59,760
You know, just walk out.

481
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:01,800
Disappear.

482
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:06,920
Well, if... if you do it, if you...

483
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:10,520
If you decide to...

484
00:54:14,080 --> 00:54:15,680
just try to come back, okay?

485
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:32,520
You know that...

486
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:36,840
that thing Clark said
about holding his hatch?

487
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:39,320
Being down there in the dark...

488
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:44,600
I've been feeling that way
for so long.

489
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:49,640
Holding the hatch.

490
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:53,800
Fucking terrified
of the one trying to open it.

491
00:54:58,240 --> 00:54:59,280
I was so wrong.

492
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:03,720
What did you say?

493
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:07,960
That I was wrong?

494
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:10,760
No. Holding the hatch.

495
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:31,136
- What are you doing?
- There's a UV light over there.

496
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:32,160
Go get it.

497
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:40,240
Come on.

498
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:45,520
What are we looking for?

499
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:47,320
I don't know.

500
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:49,320
He said holding the hatch.

501
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:53,920
Danvers.

502
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:10,240
We weren't asking the right question.

503
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:15,160
The question isn't
who killed Annie K...

504
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:19,040
but who knows who killed her?

505
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:17,280
Coming! Jesus, a bit fucking early!

506
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:25,240
Beatrice Malee and Blair Hartman...

507
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:29,880
we need to ask you some questions
about some physical evidence

508
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:34,000
that pertains to the death
of the seven men at Tsalal Station.

509
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,440
Who wants to discuss it?

510
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:41,560
I'm Elizabeth Danvers,
Chief of Ennis Police.

511
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,080
That's my partner.

512
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:46,560
I'm Evangeline
Siqiññaatchiaq Navarro.

513
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:53,240
My Aaka's name was Siqiññaatchiaq.

514
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:56,760
Do you know what it means?

515
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:04,120
It means the return of the sun
after the long darkness.

516
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:19,280
Right. So, the Tsalal men...

517
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:21,800
Those fuckers killed Annie K.

518
00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:25,080
You knew.

519
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,000
All along.

520
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:28,600
No.

521
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:30,960
For six years,
we thought it was the mine.

522
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:32,480
The town.

523
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:36,360
To shut her up. Shut everyone up.

524
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:42,760
And then, we understood.

525
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:46,760
Damn.

526
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:15,800
Why didn't you report it?

527
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:19,280
To you? The cops?

528
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:23,080
That would change nothing.

529
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:29,960
It's always the same story
with the same ending.

530
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:33,080
Nothing ever happens.

531
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:37,160
So, we told ourselves
a different story.

532
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:39,600
With a different ending.

533
00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:48,400
How does this story go?

534
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:15,920
Down!

535
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:17,880
Please! No, no!

536
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:37,280
In this story, you killed the men?

537
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:40,760
Honey, they did it to themselves.

538
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:45,360
When they dug in
her home in the ice...

539
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:47,680
when they killed her daughter
in there.

540
01:00:55,080 --> 01:00:56,120
They woke her up.

541
01:01:13,160 --> 01:01:14,440
Get out of the truck!

542
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:17,240
Now!

543
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:21,320
What do you want?

544
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:24,880
Take your clothes off!

545
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:28,240
Take your fucking clothes off!

546
01:01:31,560 --> 01:01:33,840
- Take your clothes off!
- Take it off!

547
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:38,400
- Wait! Wait! Please, no!
- Let's go! Now!

548
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:39,840
- Down!
- Get down!

549
01:01:40,840 --> 01:01:43,000
<i>If she wanted them,
she would take them.</i>

550
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:47,840
Go!

551
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:51,920
- Go!
- No, please don't shoot.

552
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,760
And if not, their clothes
were there for them.

553
01:01:56,920 --> 01:01:59,880
They'd be half frozen,
but they'd survive.

554
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:08,520
But they didn't, though.

555
01:02:10,360 --> 01:02:13,000
I guess she wanted to take them.

556
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:20,160
I guess she ate their fucking dreams
from the inside out

557
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:23,000
and spit their frozen bones.

558
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:34,400
But it's just a story.

559
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:59,480
So, Siqiññaatchiaq...

560
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:02,720
what will it be?

561
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:19,200
Stories are stories.

562
01:03:27,080 --> 01:03:29,240
We just swung by to inform you.

563
01:03:31,120 --> 01:03:32,360
That the forensics came back.

564
01:03:33,840 --> 01:03:35,920
The cause of death
was a slab avalanche.

565
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:39,040
This case is officially closed.

566
01:03:41,480 --> 01:03:42,640
Thought you'd want to know...

567
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:45,160
seeing as they were
your employers and all.

568
01:03:52,360 --> 01:03:54,320
Happy New Year, Miss Hartman.

569
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:55,880
Miss Malee...

570
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:23,800
In your story, Annie's tongue.

571
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:26,040
Who left it at Tsalal?

572
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:29,600
That's not part of our story.

573
01:04:31,120 --> 01:04:32,280
You didn't leave it there?

574
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:35,560
I don't know
what you're talking about.

575
01:05:08,760 --> 01:05:09,760
All right.

576
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:13,520
Let's start with the disappearance
of Officer Henry D. Prior

577
01:05:13,600 --> 01:05:15,720
on December 31 of last year.

578
01:05:16,840 --> 01:05:18,440
That's an ongoing investigation.

579
01:05:19,320 --> 01:05:22,000
So, the body of a local vagrant,
Otis Heiss

580
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:24,800
was found in the trunk
of Hank Prior's car.

581
01:05:25,840 --> 01:05:29,640
Ballistics showed that the bullet
had been fired from Hank's gun.

582
01:05:30,120 --> 01:05:31,616
But you were the one
who checked Mr. Heiss out

583
01:05:31,640 --> 01:05:33,160
of the Lighthouse
Rehabilitation Center

584
01:05:33,240 --> 01:05:34,240
on the day of his death.

585
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:36,000
Yeah, that's correct.

586
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:38,160
Mr. Heiss had some information

587
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:40,320
about the whereabouts
of Raymond Clark.

588
01:05:41,320 --> 01:05:43,160
Surveillance footage
from the Lighthouse

589
01:05:43,240 --> 01:05:47,920
showed that Hank, Officer Prior,
was watching my car.

590
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:50,480
So.

591
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:55,080
It's possible that he followed us

592
01:05:55,840 --> 01:05:58,120
he approached Mr. Heiss
after we separated.

593
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:01,480
My best guess is
it was a... a deal gone bad.

594
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:05,960
Mr. Heiss got shot, and Hank...

595
01:06:06,680 --> 01:06:08,880
Officer Prior, when he went
to dispose of the body

596
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:11,480
suffered some accident
in the blizzard.

597
01:06:13,040 --> 01:06:15,640
You know, come summer,
we'll find him.

598
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:17,160
We always do...

599
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:19,600
unless we don't.

600
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:24,760
Young Officer Prior.

601
01:06:25,840 --> 01:06:27,320
Pete was Hank's son.

602
01:06:28,760 --> 01:06:30,720
He was out looking for us
that night, the storm.

603
01:06:32,080 --> 01:06:33,760
I'm sure you read
about that in the report.

604
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:36,176
Don't you find it odd that Clark died

605
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:38,240
in the exact same manner
as the Tsalal men?

606
01:06:39,960 --> 01:06:43,040
Yes, incredibly odd.

607
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:48,360
But some questions
just don't have answers.

608
01:06:51,360 --> 01:06:52,720
What about Trooper Navarro?

609
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:54,480
What happened to her?

610
01:06:58,680 --> 01:07:01,960
Well, some people come
to Alaska to escape, you know?

611
01:07:06,520 --> 01:07:07,720
Get away from something.

612
01:07:12,920 --> 01:07:13,920
Navarro?

613
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:18,440
Navarro?

614
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:53,680
Hey, boy, hey... you want some?

615
01:08:01,120 --> 01:08:03,200
Sometimes, they come here
looking for something.

616
01:08:13,480 --> 01:08:14,600
Sometimes they find it.

617
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:46,960
<i>Okay, go.</i>

618
01:08:49,400 --> 01:08:50,640
<i>My name is Raymond Clark.</i>

619
01:08:51,800 --> 01:08:53,560
<i>I worked at the Tsalal
Research Station</i>

620
01:08:53,640 --> 01:08:55,680
<i>in Ennis, Alaska for 15 years.</i>

621
01:08:56,480 --> 01:08:57,600
<i>This is the truth.</i>

622
01:08:58,920 --> 01:09:01,880
<i>I am profoundly sorry
for the part I played in this.</i>

623
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:07,000
<i>Pollution levels in the region
are 11 times higher</i>

624
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:08,440
<i>than those currently acceptable</i>

625
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:11,640
<i>by the Vienna Convention
and the UNFCCC.</i>

626
01:09:12,360 --> 01:09:15,280
<i>The pollution knowingly created
by Silver Sky</i>

627
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:20,040
<i>has caused cancer,
stillbirths, birth defects</i>

628
01:09:20,120 --> 01:09:21,760
<i>and irreparable genetic damage</i>

629
01:09:21,840 --> 01:09:24,280
<i>to both the human
and animal population.</i>

630
01:09:24,360 --> 01:09:25,360
<i>The effects of...</i>

631
01:09:27,760 --> 01:09:29,040
Have you seen the Clark video?

632
01:09:30,840 --> 01:09:32,520
Everybody's seen the Clark video.

633
01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:36,520
Do you have any idea
who leaked that video?

634
01:09:37,560 --> 01:09:39,560
No, no idea.

635
01:09:40,680 --> 01:09:41,680
Does it matter?

636
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:45,360
How do you plan on dealing
with political unrest in Ennis?

637
01:09:46,040 --> 01:09:49,120
Well, political unrest is not my job.

638
01:09:51,880 --> 01:09:54,080
This town was here
long before the mine

639
01:09:54,720 --> 01:09:56,000
long before the APF...

640
01:09:57,880 --> 01:10:00,080
long before Alaska
was even named Alaska.

641
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:03,360
I'm just gonna show up...

642
01:10:04,360 --> 01:10:06,640
Do my job every day like I always do.

643
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:08,920
What else is there?

644
01:10:10,840 --> 01:10:11,840
Anything else?

645
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,520
So, you have no theories about
what happened to Trooper Navarro?

646
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:21,360
No, you do a pretty good job.

647
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:22,560
No, it's not.

648
01:10:26,360 --> 01:10:27,680
Well, let's put it this way.

649
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:33,240
I don't think you'll find
Evangeline Navarro

650
01:10:33,320 --> 01:10:34,440
out there on the ice.

651
01:10:53,160 --> 01:10:55,000
So, those reports
of sightings of her?

652
01:10:56,360 --> 01:10:57,360
They may be true?

653
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:02,680
Well, this is Ennis.

654
01:11:10,200 --> 01:11:11,560
Nobody ever really leaves.
