{\an8}真探  前情提要

18
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:04,220
她总是有各种各样的麻烦
You know, she's always been in some kind of trouble.

19
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:06,020
我原以为事情有所好转
I thought things were getting better.

20
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:07,510
跟查理分开了
Got away from Charlie.

21
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:09,820
前一阵子她还给你打过电话
She called up here for you not too long ago.

22
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:12,160
说要去当修女
She's gonna become a nun.

23
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:14,800
你昨晚干什么去了
You know, what'd you do last night?

24
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,520
我和女朋友们出去玩
I was out with girlfriends.

25
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:18,860
我不能在家里和好男人约会
I can't meet a nice man at home.

26
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:21,580
我只想跟你们在一起
There is nowhere else I want to be.

27
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:23,480
你可能都没意识到自己在撒谎
I wonder if you even know you're lying.

28
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:24,900
得了吧
Oh, come on!

29
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,370
我有一本侦探小说  写着我的两个警探无所作为
I got a whodunit where my two detectives are stalling,

30
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:30,190
还有一个特别小组想接手这案子
and I got a task force wants to take it off our hands.

31
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:31,220
所以科尔不想把案子
So Cohle didn't want to

32
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:33,200
移交给特别小组  你呢
give it to the task force. Did you?

33
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:34,340
不
No.

34
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:35,700
我知道这个地方
I heard of this place.

35
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,250
是个活动住房区一类的地方  她们管那里叫大农场
Kind of trailer park. They call it "The Ranch."

36
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:40,020
有个女孩遇难了  我们想知道
Something happened to a girl, and we need to know

37
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:41,470
你们有谁认识她
if any of you knew her.

38
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:42,790
对  这是朵莉
Yeah. That's Dori.

39
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:43,810
你知道她过去几周
You got any idea where she might

40
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:45,770
在哪儿呆着吗
have been staying the last few weeks?

41
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:48,850
她还去教堂  我还在指望
She'd been going to church. I was hoping maybe

42
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:51,170
也许她重新做人了
she just turned things around.

43
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:52,130
{\an8}你是否迷失  孤独  耶稣会拯救你

44
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,870
这个地方毁了
Place is trashed.

45
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:55,900
什么东西都没有了
This ain't no kinda anything.

46
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:57,500
小马
Marty?

47
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:29,050
{\an8}真探
第一季第三集

48
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:17,890
就像看不见灰烬中的足迹一样  你们也看不见祂
You were as blind to Him as your footprints in the ashes,

49
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:19,070
但祂看得见你们
but He saw you.

50
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:24,190
祂见你们蜷缩在阴暗角落
He saw you in those dark corners.

51
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:26,550
祂听得见你们
He heard you--

52
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,800
兄弟姐妹们  祂听得见这些念头
Oh, my brothers, He heard those thoughts.

53
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:31,970
-对  -颂扬主
- Yes! - Preach it.

54
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:34,020
-阿门  -对
- Amen! - Yes!

55
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:36,560
赞美主
Yes. Glory.

56
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,890
你不了解自己  而主了解你 
You are stranger to yourself, and yet He knows you...

57
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:41,940
阿门  对  祂了解我们
Amen. Yes. He does, sir.

58
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:44,360
当你铁石心肠时  你会化作石头
And when your heart hardened, made you liken to the stone,

59
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,950
从祂身上剥离
and broke you from His body,

60
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,910
而祂是天上的繁星  是繁星间的和风
which is the stars and the wind between the stars,

61
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,090
他了解你
He knew you.

62
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,100
他了解你  这是永恒真理
He knew you. That is forever.

63
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,840
阿门  兄弟
Amen, brother!

64
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,710
这个世界无法看清
This world is a veil...

65
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:02,450
阿门
Amen. Yeah.

66
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:04,380
告诉他们  哈利路亚
Tell them. Hallelujah.

67
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:09,830
你现在的面目并非你自己
and the face you wear is not your own.

68
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,590
教区的护教士说  教堂是在4个多月前
Parish FD said the church burned down

69
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:16,930
烧毁的  没有指纹
4 months earlier, no prints,

70
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:20,270
我们发了一份基督之友教会的通缉令
put out an APB on Friends of Christ.

71
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:24,290
一周后  我们去了富兰克林
Week later, we were in Franklin,

72
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:29,110
那里的奋兴牧师
um, Revival Ministry,

73
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:31,170
有着老派的宗教作风
old-time religion.

74
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:34,950
你们可以想象魅力先生[拉斯特]是怎么想的
You can imagine what Mr. Charisma thought of that.

75
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:36,980
这不过是你感官上的限制
It is merely the limitation of your senses.

76
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:38,270
你认为这群人的
What do you think the average IQ

77
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,860
平均智商如何
of this group is, huh?

78
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:45,210
还有跟你一样傲慢无礼的德州人吗
Can you see Texas up there on your high horse?

79
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,060
你对这群人知道些什么
What do you know about these people?

80
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:50,800
就认真观察  再分析推理
Just observation and deduction.

81
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:53,980
我发现这些人都偏肥胖  贫穷
I see a propensity for obesity, poverty,

82
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:55,670
渴望童话般得美好
a yen for fairy tales,

83
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:58,400
人们把他们仅有的那点钱
folks putting what few bucks they do have

84
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,570
放进那个依次传递的
into little, wicker baskets

85
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:01,040
小篮子里面
being passed around.

86
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:02,740
小马  我敢确信
I think it's safe to say that nobody here

87
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:04,750
这里的人很团结
is gonna be splitting the atom, Marty.

88
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:08,900
瞧见没  你太拽了
You see that? You're fucking attitude.

89
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:12,140
没人想要独自在一间空屋
Not everybody want to sit alone in a empty room

90
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:14,200
对着谋杀手册撸管
beating off to murder manuals.

91
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:19,230
有些人喜欢团体生活  共同利益
Some folks enjoy community, the common good.

92
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:20,850
是吗  如果共同利益
Yeah? Well, if the common good

93
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:22,460
需要靠编造童话为生
has got to make up fairy tales,

94
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:24,320
那它对谁都没好处
then it's not good for anybody.

95
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,850
悲伤将你们禁锢于此
Your sorrows pin you to this place.

96
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,550
它们让你心智迷失
They divide you from what your heart knows,

97
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:32,690
世上有很多善良之心
and there are a lot of good hearts out there.

98
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:33,320
我能看到
I'm looking out there.

99
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,860
我能看到很多善良之心
I'm seeing a lot of good hearts out there.

100
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,740
看到世上很多喜悦
I see a lot of joy out there.

101
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:39,780
我说  你能想象吗
I mean, can you imagine

102
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:42,120
如果人们没有了信仰
if people didn't believe,

103
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,230
他们会做出什么事来
what things they'd get up to?

104
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:46,430
他们会像现在一样
Exact same thing they do now,

105
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:48,050
跑到世外来
just out in the open.

106
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:50,990
放  屁
Bull...shit.

107
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:54,380
没了信仰  这个世界将充斥着
It'd be a fucking freak show of murder

108
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:55,920
谋杀和淫逸
and debauchery, and you know it.

109
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,900
如果只有期待神的奖励
If the only thing keeping a person decent

110
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,300
才能让人走正道
is the expectation of divine reward,

111
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,660
那么兄弟  那种人才是垃圾
then, brother, that person is a piece of shit,

112
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:07,490
我很愿意尽我所能把他们清除到世外来
and I'd like to get as many of them out in the open as possible.

113
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:09,970
我觉得你的评论就像
I guess your judgment is infallible

114
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:11,500
臭大粪一样准确
piece-of-shitwise.

115
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:17,000
你觉得圣经是墓碑吗
Do you think that notebook is a stone tablet?

116
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:22,180
对于生命它怎么描述的
What's it say about life,

117
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:29,050
你们要聚在一起  给自己讲
you got to get together, tell yourself stories

118
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:31,730
亵渎宇宙万物法则的故事
that violate every law of the universe

119
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:33,960
只为了熬日子
just to get through the goddamn day?

120
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,010
-算了吧  -你就不担心吗
- No. - Don't you worry about it?

121
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:38,220
信仰怎么解决你的现实问题呢  小马
What's that say about your reality, Marty?

122
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:40,210
每次你这么说话的时候
When you get to talking like this,

123
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:42,960
感觉都很惊慌失措
you sound panicked.

124
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:45,940
你觉得那都是骗人的  是吧
You figure it's all a scam, huh,

125
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:47,610
所有人都是吗
all them folks?

126
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:49,670
他们全错了吗
They just wrong?

127
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:51,440
没错
Oh, yeah.

128
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:55,090
自从有个猴子看着太阳
Been that way since one monkey looked at the sun

129
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:56,350
对另一只猴子说
and told the other monkey,

130
00:06:56,350 --> 00:07:00,700
神说  让你跟我分享你那见鬼的一切
"He said for you to give me your fucking share."

131
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:05,910
人是很脆弱的  他们宁愿
People so goddamn frail they'd rather

132
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:07,610
把钱扔进许愿井
put a coin in a wishing well

133
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:09,450
也不用来买晚餐
than buy dinner.

134
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:14,160
耶稣基督耶稣基督  你的双臂张开又闭合
Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ, Your arms open and close.

135
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:16,160
我生命的共鸣难以容纳
The echoes of my life could never contain

136
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,530
你的任一真理
a single truth about You.

137
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:19,140
你将翎毛移入灰烬
You move the feather in the ash.

138
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:21,510
你用它的火焰轻抚树叶
You touch the leaf with its flame.

139
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:22,610
-阿门  -阿门
- Amen! - Amen.

140
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:24,860
把恐惧和自我厌恶转移到
Transference of fear and self-loathing

141
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:26,930
权威主义这个容器中
to an authoritarian vessel.

142
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:28,770
这是种宣泄
It's catharsis.

143
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,810
他用叙述故事来吸走他们的恐惧
He absorbs their dread with his narrative.

144
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:34,010
正因为如此  他的话能否让人信服
Because of this, he's effective

145
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:35,990
和他所勾勒的故事的确定性
in proportion to the amount of certainty

146
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:37,400
成正比
he can project.

147
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:41,490
某些语言人类学家认为
Certain linguistic anthropologists think

148
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:44,160
宗教是语言的病毒
that religion is a language virus

149
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:47,350
能改写大脑路径
that rewrites pathways in the brain,

150
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:49,610
让批判性思维变得愚钝
dulls critical thinking.

151
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:53,940
我不像你会那么多高深词汇
Well, I don't use $10 words as much as you,

152
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,970
但是对一个看不出生存意义的人来说
but for a guy who sees no point in existence,

153
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:00,470
你还真够发愁的
you sure fret about it an awful lot,

154
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:03,860
说这话时你还是很惊慌失措
and you still sound panicked.

155
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,840
至少我没有明知故犯
At least I'm not racing to a red light.

156
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:13,420
...所有自我怀疑  因为祂能得知
...every self-doubt because he knows it.

157
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:17,810
我们都遇到了我称之为"生命陷阱"的东西
See, we all got what I call a life trap,

158
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:21,990
它让你相信一切都会不同
this gene-deep certainty that things will be different,

159
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,760
你会搬到其它城市
that you'll move to another city

160
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,640
会遇到朋友  这些朋友
and meet the people that'll be the friends

161
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,860
会陪伴你一生
for the rest of your life,

162
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:30,910
你会陷入爱情并实现梦想
that you'll fall in love and be fulfilled.

163
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:35,760
该死的梦想成真  以及生命的完结
Fucking fulfillment, heh, and closure,

164
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:37,810
不管这两者到底是什么
whatever the fuck those two--

165
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:41,770
没有金刚钻就想揽瓷器活儿
Fucking empty jars to hold this shitstorm,

166
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:44,140
什么梦想都无法成就
and nothing is ever fulfilled

167
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:48,830
直到世界末日  而完结
until the very end, and closure--

168
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:53,230
不  不  一切都不会完结
No. No, no. Nothing is ever over.

169
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:03,190
塞里奥特牧师
Minister Theriot,

170
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:05,440
你认识这个女孩吗
do you recognize this girl?

171
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:07,550
我不确定
I don't know for sure.

172
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:08,420
您的布道太精彩了
Wonderful sermon.

173
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:09,590
感谢你能来
Well, thank you for coming.

174
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,960
-谢谢  -谢谢
- Thank you. - Thank you.

175
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,730
我得说这个
I want to say it's--

176
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:15,920
谢谢
Thank you.

177
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:17,780
我不知道名字
I don't remember the name,

178
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,890
我们在尤尼斯的时候经常来
came pretty regularly when we was in Eunice,

179
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:21,920
但我不是很确定
but I can't be sure.

180
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,700
那之后我们就在四处游荡
We get around since then.

181
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,910
你呢  你好
You? Oh, hello.

182
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:28,350
你说得对  我们在尤尼斯见过她
No. You're right. We saw her in Eunice.

183
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:29,830
蒂娜有可能认识她
Tina might know her.

184
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:33,240
你们在尤尼斯待了多久
How long were you in Eunice?

185
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:35,700
大约六个月
About 6 months.

186
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,780
奥珀卢瑟斯里一个寡妇开的租金很便宜
Widow in Opelousas leased us cheap.

187
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:39,220
那个地方着火后我们就离开了
We left when it caught fire.

188
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:40,930
知道怎么起火的吗
Any idea how that happened?

189
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:44,020
你们的人说是恶作剧升级
Your people said criminal mischief.

190
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:46,850
我猜是寡妇的其中一个儿子
If I was to lay odds, maybe one of the widow's sons

191
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:49,570
想让我们离开那里  但我们已经不计较了
wanted us off the land, but we move on.

192
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:51,350
我们既不要个说法也不寻求报复
We seek no title nor retribution.

193
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:53,230
-我去找大卫  -好的
- I'm gonna go find David. - Ok.

194
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:56,040
传道说得不错
Yeah. Great preaching.

195
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:57,870
你做这个多久了
How long you been doing this?

196
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:00,720
已经传道将近20年了
Been preaching almost 20 years.

197
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,150
过去八年我们组织了基督之友教会
We've had Friends of Christ for the last 8.

198
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:04,910
在这之前你在教堂待过吗
You with a church before that?

199
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:07,500
我是独立福音派教徒
Independent evangelical.

200
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:09,690
我在比利·李·塔特尔手下受教
I came up under Billy Lee Tuttle,

201
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:12,320
在他在巴顿鲁日的学校里学了几年
went to his college in Baton Rouge a couple years.

202
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:14,670
关于尤尼斯
So back in Eunice,

203
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:17,500
谁画的教堂的壁画
who painted the mural on the church wall?

204
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,810
我们教堂会众的孩子们画的
Children from our congregation painted it.

205
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:23,180
很抱歉
I'm sorry.

206
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:25,530
这个女孩出了什么事情吗
Something happen to this girl?

207
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:26,800
你在找她吗
You looking for her?

208
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:29,420
塞里奥特先生  我们能看一下
Mr. Theriot, can we see the identification

209
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,770
你职员的身份证明吗
of your staff members?

210
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,520
你看她和谁在一起过
You ever see her with anybody?

211
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:37,310
有一天她好像和某个人在一起
Wasn't she with someone the one day?

212
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:40,610
你记得吗  高个男人
You remember? The tall man.

213
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:42,680
记得  但我不知道
Yeah, but I don't know

214
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,770
她是不是和他"在一起"那样的在一起
if she was "with him" with him.

215
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:47,870
你能向我描述一下他吗
Well, can you describe him?

216
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:52,470
我只是看见他们在说话
I just saw them talking.

217
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:54,160
我没有靠近或是怎么样
I didn't get close or anything.

218
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:57,900
他身体前倾和她说话
He was hunched forward talking to her,

219
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:01,370
是张陌生面孔  我觉得
kind of a strange face, I think,

220
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:04,400
下巴周围的皮肤很有光泽
skin shiny around his jaw.

221
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:07,730
什么样的  像是烧伤那样的吗
Ah, what, like burned?

222
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:14,480
所以他们俩一起离开的吗
So did she leave with him?

223
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:17,280
是的  应该是这样
Yeah, maybe like that.

224
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:20,230
89年10月因为妨害风化罪被逮捕
Arrested 10/89 on a 314,

225
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:23,180
去年一次帮派纠纷后一直在关禁闭
spent last year in solitary after a gang altercation.

226
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:24,500
打出来收好  谢谢
Print and hold. Thank you.

227
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,520
收到
Copy that.

228
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:46,840
所有事都查清楚了吗
Everything check out?

229
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:48,400
重要的都知道了
For the most part.

230
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:53,540
伯特  你在安哥拉待了两年
Burt, you spent two years in Angola--

231
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:56,640
猥亵行为  公开暴露
indecency, public exposure,

232
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,290
在学校外撸管
whacking off outside a school.

233
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:04,490
他们给我的药有问题  我不知道
They gave me bad medicine. I didn't know.

234
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:08,290
我付过钱的  我付过钱的
I paid for that. I paid for that.

235
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:12,320
你知道他在12月25号
Can you account for his whereabouts

236
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,440
到1月3号之间的行踪吗
December 25 through January 3?

237
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,680
圣诞节到元旦
Yeah. Christmas to New Year's,

238
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,990
我们在新罗兹
we was in New Roads.

239
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:19,330
可以找到很多人
Shouldn't be a problem to find people

240
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:20,990
来担保伯特的行踪
who'll vouch for Burt's whereabouts.

241
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,950
当时到会者很多
We had a good turnout there.

242
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:24,390
很多到会者在
Good turnout in--

243
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:29,320
警探  你觉得是怎么回事
Detective, what is it you think happened?

244
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,880
有人杀了这个女孩  用她的尸体大做文章
Someone killed this girl, made a big show of it...

245
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:37,910
在你们的一间旧教堂上
left a painting of the crime scene

246
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:39,520
留下了一幅犯罪现场的画
on one of your old churches.

247
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:43,100
"对信吾之人
"I am the resurrection and the light

248
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,880
吾即复活和光明"
for those who believe in me."

249
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:51,940
她被强奸了吗  警探
Was she raped, detective?

250
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:56,550
为什么这么问
Why would you ask that?

251
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:04,170
如果你单独和伯特谈谈
If you speak to Burt alone,

252
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:08,150
我相信你会明白
I believe you'll be adequately convinced

253
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:09,860
他是无辜的  警探
of his innocence, detective.

254
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,440
好吧  就这么办
OK. Let's do that.

255
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:17,150
伯特  跟警探走一趟
Burt, go with the detective.

256
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:21,810
期待光明就在黑暗尽头
The ontological fallacy of expecting

257
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:23,720
这一存在论的谬论
a light at the end of the tunnel,

258
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,640
这就是传道士的伎俩
well, that's what the preacher sells,

259
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:27,790
跟精神病医生的手法一样
same as a shrink.

260
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:31,640
传道士  他激发起
See, the preacher, he encourages

261
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,980
你的幻想力
your capacity for illusion.

262
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:36,300
然后他跟你说这他妈的是种美德
Then he tells you it's a fucking virtue.

263
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:39,130
能这么做的都不简单
Always a buck to be had doing that,

264
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:45,010
听起来又是如此理所当然  不是吗
and it's such a desperate sense of entitlement, isn't it?

265
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:49,070
"毫无疑问  这一切都是为了我"
"Surely, this is all for me".

266
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,210
"我"
"Me".

267
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:56,170
"我  我  我  我  我"
"Me, me, me. I, I."

268
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:58,830
"我可真他妈的重要"
"I'm so fucking important."

269
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:01,310
"我可真他妈的重要  对吗"
"I'm so fucking important, then, right?"

270
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:04,530
-去你妈的  -我们出去一下
- Fuck you. - Excuse us for a second.

271
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:20,000
我不知道
I didn't know.

272
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,570
别紧张  我不会伤害你的
Easy. I am not gonna hurt you.

273
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:24,180
我不会伤害你的
I'm not gonna hurt you.

274
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,600
怜悯是种美德  警探
Compassion is ethics, Detective.

275
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,140
的确如此
Yes. It is.

276
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:43,960
我调查了他们所有人
I ran checks on all of them.

277
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:46,750
除了伯特  所有人都没有不良记录
Everyone has got a clean record except for Burt.

278
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:50,290
我觉得这有点像是白痴做的事
I could see this being some kind of retard job--

279
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:53,900
有人指使  感到羞愧
pays for it, gets ashamed,

280
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:55,990
反应过度
overreacts,

281
00:14:56,970 --> 00:15:00,690
试图挽回  如此种种  你觉得呢
tries to redeem the act, like, you know?

282
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:03,330
推理的不错  小马
That's not bad, Marty...

283
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:04,660
是啊
Well, yeah.

284
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:06,900
在没有你的帮助之下我自己想出来的
I got all the way there without your help.

285
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:08,750
不过凶手不是他
But it's not him.

286
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:13,360
他因为裸下体在农场里度过了一段艰难的日子
He did a deuce at the farm for dick wagging.

287
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:15,800
应该待在精神病院的
Should've been in a mental ward to begin with.

288
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,560
后来呢
Give me the second half.

289
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,910
在安哥拉
Angola.

290
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:21,140
几个布拉德族人趁洗澡时抓住了他
Some Bloods caught him in the shower,

291
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:23,930
用剃刀割了他的蛋蛋
took his balls off with a razor.

292
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,620
他们对此还不以为然
They were sloppy about it.

293
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:27,240
天呐
Oh, Jesus.

294
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,360
但是
Still--

295
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,120
我碰了他下
I braced him.

296
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:36,590
他就拉裤子上了  字面意思
He shit himself, literally.

297
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,270
我们可以派些警察守在这儿
We can put some troopers on this place,

298
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:44,720
监视他们
have them surveil it,

299
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,420
但是我觉得我们该查下一条线索了
but I think we should move on,

300
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,020
那个高个子男人
the tall man.

301
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:51,820
那可能只是胡说八道的
Well, that could be bullshit.

302
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:52,890
一个人说了
One threw it out,

303
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:54,160
其他人跟着一起这么说
and the other one picked up on it.

304
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,600
不  伯特知道
No. Burt knew.

305
00:15:56,770 --> 00:15:58,630
他也看见那个高个子男人了
He saw the tall man, too.

306
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,810
这个人
This,

307
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,710
那玛丽·方特诺特案
that Marie Fontenot thing,

308
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:04,280
兰不会是他的第一个受害者
there's no way Lange was his first,

309
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,980
绝不可能
no fucking way.

310
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:12,860
罗西  能帮他们推下车吗
Rosie, can you help them get out, please.

311
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:28,630
我们还没查出任何匹配特征
We haven't matched any signatures.

312
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:32,220
在联邦数据库里有个人用过王冠
One guy in the fed database used crowns,

313
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:34,130
有人用过鹿角
another a set of antlers--

314
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,230
是个在密歇根的无期徒刑犯
Michigan lifer.

315
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:38,710
他说这些特征不符合
Then he called the signature wrong.

316
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:43,360
我们不知道这和玛丽·方特诺特之间
We don't know that there's any connection

317
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,930
有什么联系
to Marie Fontenot.

318
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:50,060
是啊  不过这种布阵  这种符号
Yeah, but the lattices, the symbology--

319
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:53,180
蕴含着某种文化  小马
some kind of culture to it, Marty.

320
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:58,780
他想要我们找到这具尸体
I mean, he wanted us to find this one,

321
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,010
就像他在炫耀
like he was showing off.

322
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:03,220
那片甘蔗地就是我们的舞台
That cane field is our stage.

323
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:07,130
那就快想想招儿
Make a suggestion, then.

324
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:11,190
再没线索  这案子就会移交给特别小组了
We start at zero, they're gonna hand it to the task force.

325
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:14,010
有人漏掉了些什么
Well, somebody missed something.

326
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:15,890
我们得回去  检查所有文件
We need to go back, check all files.

327
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:18,140
过去五年在本州发现的所有尸体
Any DBs in state the last 5 years,

328
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:19,350
我们从那儿开始
we start there.

329
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:22,740
我们没那时间
We don't have the hours.

330
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:25,060
该死的  伙计
Shit, man. Look.

331
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:29,080
我发现你有点缺乏远见
I've noticed you have a tendency toward myopia,

332
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:32,050
目光短浅  搞砸调查
tunnel vision, blows investigations.

333
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:35,240
扭曲事实  曲解证据
Vision skews, twists evidence.

334
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:38,390
你太沉迷了
You're obsessive.

335
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:42,470
你也沉迷  只不过不是沉迷工作
You're obsessive, too, just not about the job.

336
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:45,210
我才没有呢  哥们
Not, me, brother.

337
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:49,330
我把事情分得很开  一样重要
I keep things even, separate,

338
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,330
就好像我可以把这瓶酒干了
like the way I can have this one beer

339
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:52,810
而不会洒出来
without needing 20.

340
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:56,280
不懂内疚的人往往过得挺好
People incapable of guilt usually do have a good time.

341
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,770
只是不想对自己太苛刻
Try not to be too hard on myself.

342
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:06,930
真了不起啊
Well, that's real big of you.

343
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,950
你知道咱俩之间真正的区别是什么吗
You know the real difference between you and me?

344
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,150
知道  否认
Yeah. Denial.

345
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:16,300
区别在于我知道想法和现实
The difference is that I know the difference

346
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,600
两者之间的区别
between an idea and a fact.

347
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:22,560
你不愿承认疑惑
You are incapable of admitting doubt.

348
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,500
对我来说就是否认
Now, that sounds like denial to me.

349
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:27,530
我表示怀疑
I doubt that.

350
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:33,990
我们要对脸上有疤的
We'll put out an APB

351
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:36,840
高个男子发通缉令
on any tall man with facial scarring...

352
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:38,150
行
Ok.

353
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,670
给医院发电报寻找符合特征的病人
Telex the hospitals for patients that fit.

354
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:42,780
好
Good.

355
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,070
所以科尔想瞒着特别小组
So Cohle was trying to keep it from the task force.

356
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:05,160
回想一下  你有没有想过
Looking back, you ever think maybe

357
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,050
他可能是想把事情
he tried to push things

358
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:08,510
往他希望的方向推动呢
where he wanted them to go?

359
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:14,490
没有  我们一直被案子牵着走
No. We went where the case led us.

360
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,060
但你还是接受了
But you took it up, though,

361
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:17,760
他的连环杀手理论
his serial theory.

362
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:20,870
虽然他傲慢自大
Well, as arrogant as he could be,

363
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:22,180
但他是对的
he was right.

364
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:24,940
所以我们才能抓住凶手
I mean, that's how we got our man.

365
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,190
但我喜欢这样  知道吗
But I like it this way, you know?

366
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:32,310
很稳定
It's steady.

367
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:33,840
胡说八道
Bullshit, really.

368
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:36,020
我接受过婚姻咨询
Look. I did all the counseling and stuff.

369
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:39,710
就应该是这个样子
This is just the way things are.

370
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:41,340
不  事情是会变的
No. Things don't stay the same.

371
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:43,910
留下想要的  把其他的抛在身后
Pick up what you keep, and you leave the rest behind.

372
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:45,300
人会变好
People get better.

373
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:48,810
没错  我觉得我确实变好了
Well, that's the thing. I think I am better.

374
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:50,550
你真那么觉得吗
You really think so?

375
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:51,990
没错  相信我吧
Uh, trust me.

376
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:55,000
也许你觉得自己喜欢这种方式
Maybe you just think you prefer it this way

377
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,410
只是因为这是你习惯的方式
because it's what you're used to.

378
00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:58,830
你适应了自己的生活
Your life accommodates you.

379
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:01,340
你没必要害怕失去
You don't have to be afraid of loss.

380
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:06,180
我跟你说的那些人就是这样
Those are the guys I was telling you about.

381
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:10,040
他们养条狗  钓钓鱼  诸如此类
They get a dog, fish, what have you.

382
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,930
你开始那样的生活  就会一直那样生活下去
You start with that. You live with it.

383
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:34,350
我想你可以给我介绍个护士
Hell, I suppose you could set me up with a nurse,

384
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:37,180
给我点好药
get me some of the good drugs.

385
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:40,280
新的开始
New start.

386
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:43,710
爸爸
Daddy. Daddy.

387
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:44,860
你们好  孩子们
Hey, kids.

388
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:46,020
你好  亲爱的
Hey, honey.

389
00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:47,680
你好吗  小马
How you doing, Marty?

390
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:55,430
这什么情况  拉斯特
What's going on, Rust?

391
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,910
他把割草机送回来了
Brought the mower back.

392
00:20:58,430 --> 00:20:59,820
给我的院子割草了
Mow my yard?

393
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,160
是啊  我看需要修剪一下
Yeah. I saw it needed mowing,

394
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:04,610
就当是还人情  谢谢你们借我割草机
returned the favor, borrowing.

395
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,410
我们要做炖虾
We got etouffee,

396
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:09,240
想让拉斯特留下来吃晚饭
trying to get Rust to stay for dinner.

397
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:11,770
是吗
Oh, yeah?

398
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,510
留下来吃晚饭  拉斯特
Stay for dinner, Rust.

399
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,770
不了  我想我该走了
Nah. I think I got to get.

400
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,750
玛姬  谢谢你的茶
Maggie, thank you for the tea.

401
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:23,250
真遗憾
Sorry to hear that.

402
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:26,270
周一见
See you Monday.

403
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:29,430
我送你出去
I'll walk you out.

404
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:39,510
怎么了
What?

405
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:42,540
你以为你在干什么  你这家伙
What the hell do you think you're doing, man,

406
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,470
趁我不在上我家
at my house when I'm not here?

407
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:48,320
来归还割草机
Returning the mower.

408
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,900
你知道我的意思
You know what I mean.

409
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:52,800
给我割草
You mow my lawn? Hmm?

410
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:56,420
你以为你不在的时候
Just what'd you think I'd be doing over here

411
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:58,060
我会在这里做什么  小马
when you're not around, Marty?

412
00:21:58,570 --> 00:22:01,990
你和我  咱俩之间有什么问题吗
What's our problem, you and me?

413
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:03,320
没问题
No problem.

414
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,500
我只不过不想你打理
I just don't ever want you

415
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,210
我的草坪  好吗
mowing my lawn, all right?

416
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:10,460
我喜欢自己动手
I like mowing my lawn.

417
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:44,860
那是你支持的队伍吗  爸爸
That is your team, Daddy?

418
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:48,100
是的  宝贝儿  我希望他们能赢
Yeah, baby. That-- I want them to win.

419
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:04,430
奥德丽  你妈妈和我
Uh, hey, Audrey, your mom and I

420
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:05,970
想和你谈谈
want to talk to you a minute about

421
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:09,910
你在学校画的画  好吗
those drawings you did in school, yeah?

422
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:12,060
梅斯  回房间去
Mace, run to your room.

423
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:12,960
为什么
Why?

424
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,540
因为我这么说额  回
Because I said so. Run to y--

425
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:17,370
走  快走
Go. Go on.

426
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:20,470
走
Go.

427
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:25,280
走  跑起来
Go. Run.

428
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:31,600
听着
Look.

429
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:37,230
你不用紧张  好吗  宝贝
You don't have to get upset, honey, OK?

430
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:39,500
我们只是想和你谈谈
We just want to talk to you.

431
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:42,990
你以前在哪儿看到那些的
Where'd you see that before, hmm?

432
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:44,920
你为什么画那些东西
Why'd you draw that?

433
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:48,740
因为其他女孩喜欢
Because other girls liked it

434
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:51,100
而且觉得很有趣
and they thought it was funny.

435
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:52,070
就是这样
That's all.

436
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:57,030
但是你为什么会想画那些东西呢
Yeah, but where'd you get that idea, hmm?

437
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:02,580
女孩们说我不敢那么做
The girls dared me to do it.

438
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:04,030
上帝啊
Oh, God.

439
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:06,330
那会让人生气的  奥德丽
That upsets people, Audrey.

440
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
太丑了
It's ugly.

441
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:12,740
那让美好的事物变得
It makes something that should be nice

442
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,120
丑陋
ugly.

443
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:18,100
对不起
I'm sorry. Oh...

444
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:21,860
没事的  没事的
Shh. That's OK. It's OK.

445
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:25,700
没事的  宝贝
It's OK, sweetie.

446
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:30,550
我不是说我有资格这么说
Well, I'm not saying that I got any room to talk,

447
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:33,740
不过你知道做一名父亲意味着什么吗
but do you know what it means to be a father?

448
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:37,700
那意味着你要对家人负责
It means you are accountable for other people.

449
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:41,300
你要为他们的生命负责
You are responsible for their lives.

450
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:44,420
从某个角度来讲
Now, past a certain point,

451
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:47,920
这些责任里有一些毫无意义的事
there's a futility in responsibility.

452
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:07,920
你就这么点担心吗
That's the extent of your concern?

453
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:10,010
不
Well, no.

454
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:13,650
我只是不觉得一直看下去能有什么意义
I just don't know what looking at it any more is gonna do.

455
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:16,970
我担心的是她
It's her. I'm concerned.

456
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:20,210
她只是想得到关注
Well, she's just trying to get attention,

457
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:21,860
其他女孩
and the other girls--

458
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:25,710
上帝  她们也太早熟了吧
Jesus, how do they even know about that stuff yet?

459
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:27,940
女孩子比男孩子更早懂这些事
Girls always know before boys.

460
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:29,680
为什么
Why is that?

461
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:31,310
因为必须这样
Because they have to.

462
00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:35,910
听着  她很不合群
Listen to me. She's withdrawn.

463
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,540
她打听过你的事  想知道
She asks about you, and she wants to know

464
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:39,340
为什么你现在工作这么忙
why you're working so much now.

465
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:43,090
我很快就没这么忙了
Well, I should be working less.

466
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:45,360
特别小组会接手那个案子
Task force is gonna take that case,

467
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:49,080
我也会多待在家里
and I'll be around more.

468
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,350
上周的事了吧
Last week?

469
00:25:56,570 --> 00:25:58,980
我很抱歉  我应该推掉的
I'm sorry about that. I should've begged off.

470
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:00,680
我们那天晚上过得不错
We were having a good night.

471
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:05,130
别打断我  说出来
Don't stop me. Talk.

472
00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:10,430
我快撑不住了  小马
I'm close, Marty.

473
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:13,810
你听到了吗  我快撑不住了
Do you hear me? I'm close.

474
00:26:13,810 --> 00:26:17,560
他们会把案子从我们手里接走的
Um, they're gonna pull that case from us,

475
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:22,480
我会多陪陪你们的  我们可以做很多事
and I'll be around more, and we'll do things.

476
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:25,200
我们之间为什么有这么多隔阂  小马
Why is there all this space between us, Marty?

477
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:28,090
我不懂你的意思
I don't know what you mean.

478
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,000
你懂的
You do know what I mean,

479
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,280
但你就是不说  问题就在于此
and you won't say, and that's it.

480
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,720
那就是我说的
That's what I'm talking about.

481
00:26:34,410 --> 00:26:36,380
去年  你表现得像个阴沉的小孩
This last year, you've been a sulky teenager.

482
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:37,730
你知道的
You know it.

483
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,590
我想当你的朋友  小马
I'm trying to be your friend, Marty.

484
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:50,420
我只是不善于  表达
I'm just not good at... you know... expressing.

485
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:51,750
我们都会改变的  不是吗
We change, don't we,

486
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:54,410
虽然有时不会变太久
and sometimes not for long.

487
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:58,360
而我认为人根本不会变
And here I'm thinking people don't really change at all,

488
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:00,530
内心深处永远是同一个人
not who they are at heart.

489
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:02,460
我一直试着回忆过去
I try to remember things

490
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:03,570
因为我觉得自己必须这么做
because I feel like I should,

491
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:05,330
就好像这是我的工作
like it's my job or something,

492
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:08,320
回忆过去的时光
you know, early days,

493
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:12,360
而我已经厌倦了回忆过去
and I'm tired of trying to remember.

494
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:13,380
部分原因是...  
Part of this--

495
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:19,390
我并不是在否认这全是我的错
and I'm not talking about the part that's all my fault--

496
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:23,430
但部分原因在于  这就是生活
but part of it, it's just life.

497
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:28,010
我们以前经常整个周末都待在房间里
We used to spend weekends without leaving my room.

498
00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:29,110
-我指的不是这个  -记得吗
- That's not what I mean. - Remember that?

499
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:31,960
我们当然不再像十九岁时那样夜夜欢歌
Of course we don't screw like we're 19.

500
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:36,340
天  你的期望真低
God, you want low expectations.

501
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:38,340
你根本不思进取
You put a ceiling on your life,

502
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:41,140
任何事都是  因为你不想改变
on everything, because you won't change.

503
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:47,100
我刚认识你时  你比现在聪明多了
You were so much smarter when I met you, you know?

504
00:27:52,490 --> 00:27:54,520
我很抱歉  玛姬
I'm sorry, Maggie.

505
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:58,010
所有的一切我都很抱歉
I'm sorry for everything--

506
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:01,610
因为没有陪在你们身边
for not being here,

507
00:28:01,610 --> 00:28:05,680
认为一切都理所应当
for taking all this for granted.

508
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,140
你一直都在干什么  小马
What have you been doing, Marty?

509
00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:15,360
我...
I--

510
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:24,640
工作  家庭  办案
work, home, cases.

511
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:27,100
只是...
Just--

512
00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:32,560
我的感觉就像
I get to feeling like--

513
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:37,060
我想着四十岁时的样子
Look. I can see 40...

514
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:45,170
{\an8}[源自卡通《BB鸟和大野狼》]

515
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:45,170
感觉自己就像动画片中的大野狼
and it's like I'm that coyote in the cartoons,

516
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:47,830
跑过了悬崖
like I'm running off a cliff,

517
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:52,780
如果我不往下看继续跑的话
and if I don't look down and keep running,

518
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:56,950
可能就没事  但如果
I might be fine, but, um...

519
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:03,560
看来我把一切都搞砸了
I think I'm all fucked up.

520
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,020
确实如此
You are.

521
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:12,480
没错  你搞砸了
Yes. You are.

522
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:27,440
小马
Marty?

523
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:37,520
话说回来  我们抓了几个医院的病人
Anyway, well, we pulled a few hospital patients--

524
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:41,660
高个子  脸上有疤  性侵犯者
tall, scarred, sex offenders.

525
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:43,850
有个孩子是非法侵入的惯犯
One kid did B&Es.

526
00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:48,540
每一次犯事都要顺点东西走才行
He had to tug one out before he could leave a scene.

527
00:30:50,730 --> 00:30:53,180
当时在审讯室可待了不少时间
Yeah. A lot of room work then.

528
00:30:55,890 --> 00:30:58,000
你们谁比较擅长审讯
Which one of you guys is the box man?

529
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:01,650
是你  对吧
You, yeah?

530
00:31:03,010 --> 00:31:05,580
我以前审讯的本事也不差
I used to be pretty good in there myself,

531
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:08,500
但还是比不上拉斯特
not as good as Rust.

532
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,160
我明白  孩子
I know, son.

533
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:12,210
我能理解你
I can read this off you.

534
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:19,620
你的本质并不坏  那不是真正的你
You're not bad. It's not you.

535
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:21,200
都是因为某个东西
There's a weight,

536
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:24,060
它在你灵魂深处诱惑着你
and it got its fishhooks in your heart and your soul.

537
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:40,560
你的所作所为并不是你的错
Now, what you did is not your fault.

538
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:42,070
不是
It's not.

539
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:47,010
你的人生是被那东西毁掉的
You was drug to the bottom by that same weight,

540
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:49,640
它让你无法好好工作
the same weight that won't let you get along in a job,

541
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:52,970
它让你无法正常上学
and same weight that wouldn't let you get along at school...

542
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:01,140
它让你无法获得母爱
same weight that wouldn't let you have a mom.

543
00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:07,950
我都了解  克里斯
I know these things, Chris.

544
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:13,460
我太软弱  我有病
I'm weak. I'm sick.

545
00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:16,190
我闯进别人家里
I get into the houses,

546
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:21,250
不翻遍所有抽屉就没法离开
and I can't leave until I go all over the drawers.

547
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,560
听我说  孩子
Listen to me, son.

548
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,050
你有一条出路
You got one way out,

549
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:28,870
就是籍着上帝的恩典
and it's through the grace of God.

550
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:32,040
是主将你创造成这个样子
You're only how the Lord made you.

551
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:36,310
你并无瑕疵
You are not flawed.

552
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:39,480
我们  你  我  所有人
We, you, me, people,

553
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:42,140
都没法选择自己的感受
we don't choose our feelings.

554
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,920
这个世界蒙受圣恩
There's grace in this world,

555
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,620
所有人都能得到宽恕
and there's forgiveness for all,

556
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:50,570
但首先你得请求原谅
but you have to ask for it.

557
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:52,690
我请求  我请求  我希望得到宽恕
I do. I do. I want that.

558
00:32:52,690 --> 00:32:58,210
我希望被宽恕  我在请求  真心请求
I want it. I want that. I'm asking. I'm asking.

559
00:32:58,210 --> 00:32:59,510
告诉我  快告诉我
Tell me. Tell me.

560
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:01,300
求你告诉我应该说什么
Please just tell me what to say.

561
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:05,740
我坦白  什么都坦白
I want to confess. I want to confess.

562
00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:15,740
抱歉久等了
Sorry about that.

563
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:22,700
你的审讯记录  伙计  真是非同凡响
Your assist record, man, that's something else.

564
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:23,890
有什么秘诀吗
Any pointers?

565
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:28,250
我从来没觉得有多难
Oh, I never really found it that hard.

566
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:33,090
只需要看着他们  设身处地去想
You just look at somebody and think like they think,

567
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:36,930
消极能力
negative capability.

568
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:40,540
我觉得这是种技能
I mean, I guess it's a skill.

569
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:43,500
大多数时候  连这个都不用
Most times, you don't even need that.

570
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:45,790
只要看着他们的眼睛
You just look them in the eyes.

571
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:47,480
整个故事都会浮现出来
The whole story is right there.

572
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:52,220
所有人的饥渴与目的都无法掩饰
Everybody wears their hunger and their haunt, you know?

573
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,820
只需要坦诚接受这一切
You just got to be honest about what can go on up here,

574
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,480
这是个密室
a locked room....

575
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:05,470
不过再说一次  我很不会玩牌
but then again, I'm terrible at cards.

576
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:13,240
在我们拷问非法侵入和焚烧被害者的人渣的同时
Yeah. So while we were grilling B&E jerkoffs and burn victims,

577
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:16,320
我决定好好利用失眠症
I decided to put insomnia to good use.

578
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:38,660
{\an8}嫌疑车辆
可能原因

579
00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:45,630
人类
People.

580
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:50,500
我亲眼见过数千条生命的完结
I've seen the finale of thousands of lives, man

581
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:52,650
年轻人  老人
young, old.

582
00:34:53,530 --> 00:34:56,270
每个人都毫不质疑自己的真实性
Each one is so sure of their realness,

583
00:34:57,570 --> 00:35:03,580
认为自己的感觉经验使其成为独一无二的个体
that their sensory experience constituted a unique individual

584
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:06,190
有目标  有意义
with purpose, meaning...

585
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:13,320
从不认为自己只是生物界的玩偶
so certain that they were more than a biological puppet.

586
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:20,810
但是真相终会大白  大家都会发现
Well, the truth wills out, and everybody sees

587
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:23,490
一旦提线被割断  所有人都会倒下
once the strings are cut, all fall down.

588
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:48,180
玛姬说他很害羞
Maggie says he's shy.

589
00:35:50,490 --> 00:35:51,640
我不觉得
I wouldn't say that.

590
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:54,680
表达想法的时候可不害羞
Definitely not shy about speaking his mind.

591
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:56,120
我不是这个意思
Well, that's not what I mean.

592
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:58,720
我是说他的性格  他很不安
His personality. He's edgy.

593
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:04,610
是啊  很紧张  或者说很内向
Yeah, intense, more like, introverted.

594
00:36:04,610 --> 00:36:06,110
我不想再遇到醉鬼了
I don't want another drunk.

595
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,680
上次带我见的那个警察
The last cop you showed me--

596
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:10,070
等等  史蒂夫当时很不好过
No. Wait. Steve was going through a tough time.

597
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:11,230
他吐在我膝盖上了
He threw up in my lap.

598
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:12,450
别担心这个
Don't worry about that.

599
00:36:12,450 --> 00:36:15,200
能让他靠近你的膝盖就不错了
Getting him near you lap is gonna be the challenge.

600
00:36:16,210 --> 00:36:19,010
说曹操曹操到
Oh, hey, speak of the devil.

601
00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:21,160
-你好  拉斯特  -马丁
- Hey, Rust. - Martin.

602
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:23,850
-嘿  玛姬  -你好  拉斯特
- Hey, Maggie. - Hi, Rust.

603
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:25,090
珍妮弗  这是拉斯丁
Jennifer. Rustin.

604
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:26,450
幸会
Nice to meet you.

605
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:31,850
你走路来的吗
Well, you walk over here?

606
00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:41,670
好吧
Well...OK.

607
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:52,850
我还以为他不能更奇怪了
Just when I thought he couldn't get any stranger.

608
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:54,370
你认真的吗
Are you serious?

609
00:36:54,370 --> 00:36:56,060
他尝颜色的味道
He tastes colors.

610
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,960
所以同感是什么
So what is synesesia?

611
00:36:59,370 --> 00:37:00,380
是通感
Synesthesia.

612
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:05,980
是联合接收器和触发器的在某些方面的错位
It's a misalignment of synaptic receptors and triggers

613
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:10,010
例如碱质  色彩  或特定金属
alkalis, colors, certain metallics.

614
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:13,640
是超敏性的一种
It's a type of hyper sensitivity.

615
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:17,130
某一感官能刺激另外一种
One sense triggers another sense.

616
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,650
有时候我看到一种颜色
Sometimes I'll see a color,

617
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:21,870
嘴里会尝到一种味道
and it'll put a taste in my mouth.

618
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:25,940
触感  纹理或气味都能在我头脑中留下记号
A touch, a texture, a scent may put a note in my head.

619
00:37:26,450 --> 00:37:27,650
我从来没听说过
I've heard that.

620
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:30,000
可能是抑制素的副作用
It can be a side effect of a statin.

621
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:31,340
这不是副作用
It's not a side effect.

622
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:32,870
如果某种东西感觉很好
So when something feels good,

623
00:37:32,870 --> 00:37:35,470
是不是意味着加倍的好
does that mean it feels twice as good,

624
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:38,170
两种不同的方式
like from two different ways?

625
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:44,450
会的  是啊
It could. Yeah.

626
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:46,670
服务员会送来的  亲爱的
The waitress will bring them, babe.

627
00:37:46,810 --> 00:37:48,980
干嘛要等呢  我马上回来
Why wait? I'll be right back.

628
00:37:59,850 --> 00:38:01,780
续满  两杯朗姆
Refill and two rums.

629
00:38:14,170 --> 00:38:15,510
能再来杯啤酒吗
Hi. Can I have another beer?

630
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:16,740
谢谢
Thank you.

631
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:19,930
你在干什么
What are you doing?

632
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:22,060
你看着像什么
What's it look like?

633
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,210
我在约会  你不也是吗
I'm on a date. Aren't you?

634
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:30,640
所以你要跟那个人回家吗
So are you gonna go home with this guy?

635
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:34,500
这真的不关你事
It's really none of your business.

636
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:36,500
你上了你老婆吧
Do you fuck your wife?

637
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:40,030
你想让我怎么样
What do you want me to do?

638
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:43,770
听着  你是想靠这样让我离婚吗
Look. Is this your way of trying to talk divorce?

639
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:46,740
上帝啊  小马  我不想跟你结婚
My God, Marty, I don't want to marry you.

640
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:48,100
这是我的重点
That's my whole point.

641
00:38:48,970 --> 00:38:50,780
顺其自然吧
It's just run its course.

642
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:55,040
别这样  过来  一起喝一杯
No, it hasn't. Come here. Have a shot with me.

643
00:39:07,830 --> 00:39:09,890
我可不光是来喝酒的
I didn't just come here to drink, you know.

644
00:39:12,490 --> 00:39:13,990
我先去把这个放下
Let me just set this down.

645
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:16,440
会很有意思的
It'll be fun.

646
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,010
是啊
Yeah.

647
00:39:36,570 --> 00:39:37,450
怎么了
What?

648
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:39,770
没什么
Oh, nothing.

649
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:42,810
我还以为看到个该待在教区的家伙
Thought I saw a guy who supposed to be in parish.

650
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,420
阿拉斯加怎么样
So what's Alaska like?

651
00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:55,190
很美
It's beautiful.

652
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:58,710
不是巴黎那种美  但很干净
It's not Paris, but it's clean,

653
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:00,190
也很清澈
and it's clear.

654
00:40:00,930 --> 00:40:02,290
你去过巴黎
You've been to Paris?

655
00:40:02,990 --> 00:40:04,210
待过一个月
For a month.

656
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,160
你在巴黎干了什么
What'd you do in Paris?

657
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:12,210
基本就只是在圣母院前面喝得醉醺醺的
Mainly just got drunk in front of Notre Dame.

658
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,580
每一具平静的肉体都很清楚
Each stilled body so certain

659
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:26,780
它不仅仅是冲动的集合
that they were more than the sum of their urges,

660
00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:33,070
所有这些无用的旋转  疲惫的心灵
all the useless spinning, tired mind,

661
00:40:33,070 --> 00:40:36,310
欲望和无知的碰撞
collision of desire and ignorance.

662
00:40:40,130 --> 00:40:41,940
你问到了审讯
You asked about the interrogations.

663
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:43,670
想知道真相吗
You want to know the truth?

664
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:49,550
我从未在一间房里待过十分钟以上
I never been in a room more than 10 minutes

665
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:51,640
还不知道是不是那家伙干的
and didn't know whether the guy did it or not.

666
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,220
你们又是花了多久才知道的
How long does it take you?

667
00:40:57,010 --> 00:41:01,130
拉斯特花了大把业余时间来研究尸体
Rust spent a lot of off duty running DBs,

668
00:41:01,290 --> 00:41:05,170
有几星期吧  上辈子肯定是只猎犬
weeks of it, coon hound in another life.

669
00:41:01,290 --> 00:41:05,170
{\an8}也有攻击黑人之意

670
00:41:05,170 --> 00:41:06,400
攻击黑人
Coon hound?

671
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:10,510
我指的是单纯的猎犬
I meant raccoon hound.

672
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:13,790
现在的人都他妈容易大惊小怪的
Everybody is a fucking drama queen nowadays.

673
00:41:13,790 --> 00:41:16,500
老天  听着
Jesus. Look.

674
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:20,700
如果照他的理论做  如果他的工作
If working his theories, if his job

675
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:23,430
就是让他随心所欲  那也没关系  
was his idea of himself, fine.

676
00:41:23,430 --> 00:41:26,860
可我们剩下这些人是有家庭的
I mean, the rest of us had families,

677
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:29,120
有亲友  还有其他美好的事物
people in our lives, good things.

678
00:41:29,130 --> 00:41:31,690
人们给你规定
People give you rules.

679
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:34,670
规定就是用来描述事物的轮廓
Rules describe the shape of things.

680
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,280
出来
Come on!

681
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:45,040
我操
Fuck you!

682
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,880
操  小马  快滚
Fuck, Marty, get out of here.

683
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,950
"操  小马"  这就是你想对我说的
"Fuck, Marty." Is that all you got for me?

684
00:41:54,950 --> 00:41:57,060
够了  回家去  我不想继续这样了
Stop it. Go home. I don't want this anymore.

685
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:58,680
你屋里藏着奸夫吗
You got that little shitbird in here?

686
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:00,400
滚  不然我报警了
Go away. I'll call the cops.

687
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,910
我倒要看看报警有没有用
Well, let's see how that works out for you.

688
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:03,430
-我认识别的警察  -好吧
- I know other cops. - OK.

689
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:07,660
出去  小马  出去
Get out. Marty, get out.

690
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:08,840
她说她是单身的
But she said she was single.

691
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:12,440
小马  天哪  住手  快住手
Marty, God! Stop! Stop it!

692
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:13,360
她给你吹箫了吗
Did she suck your dick, huh?

693
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:14,600
住手
Stop it!

694
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:16,000
她给你吹箫了吗
She suck your fucking dick?

695
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,660
住手  滚出去  下来
Stop it! Get out! Get off.

696
00:42:19,550 --> 00:42:20,840
下来
Get off!

697
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:22,050
要试试这个吗
Yeah. You try it?

698
00:42:22,050 --> 00:42:23,430
你自己说  不然我就让
Oh, you tell me, or I'll have

699
00:42:23,430 --> 00:42:27,730
监狱第九区的女人把你的脸当避孕套用
some Ninth Ward prison queen wearing your face for a condom.

700
00:42:28,290 --> 00:42:31,570
她给你吹箫了吗
Did she suck your dick?

701
00:42:31,570 --> 00:42:33,410
就一点点
Just for a little bit.

702
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:35,510
下来
Get off.

703
00:42:36,930 --> 00:42:39,250
求你住手
Please stop it.

704
00:42:42,250 --> 00:42:44,340
抱歉揍了你的脸  伙计
Sorry I got in your face, guy.

705
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:48,250
我以前不这样
I wouldn't have really done something like that.

706
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:50,480
我不是神经病
I'm not a psycho.

707
00:42:57,340 --> 00:43:02,280
所以我总说拉斯特需要一个家
That's why I always said I think Rust needed a family.

708
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:07,520
可以划清界限  界限是个好东西
It's boundaries. Boundaries are good.

709
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:39,030
我是科尔
This is Cohle.

710
00:43:39,030 --> 00:43:41,280
拉斯特  你在家
Rust, you're home.

711
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:43,550
-是我  -怎么了
- It's me. - Yeah. What's wrong?

712
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:44,770
对不起
I'm sorry.

713
00:43:44,770 --> 00:43:46,680
史蒂夫·杰瑞西说他遇到点事
Steve Geraci said he caught something.

714
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:48,120
他需要帮助
He needed help.

715
00:43:49,550 --> 00:43:51,660
我差点给局里打电话了  可有什么用
I almost called the station, but what's the point?

716
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:52,970
你知道他们都会说谎
You know they lie.

717
00:43:56,380 --> 00:43:58,190
我只能给你添麻烦了
I got to put you on the spot.

718
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:01,010
你知道这是真的吗
You know if it's true?

719
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:05,400
我什么都没听说
I didn't hear anything,

720
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:08,080
不过就算有事我也不会知道
but then again, I wouldn't.

721
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:10,830
杰瑞西不会告诉我的
I mean, Geraci wouldn't pull me.

722
00:44:10,830 --> 00:44:12,130
他讨厌我
He hates me.

723
00:44:19,590 --> 00:44:21,790
你把珍送回家了
You drop Jen at home?

724
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:25,350
是  我把她送到了门口
Yeah. I walked her to the door.

725
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:28,710
你没进去吗
You didn't go in?

726
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:31,350
没必要非得一见钟情
You don't have to fall in love at first sight, you know.

727
00:44:31,350 --> 00:44:35,290
我知道  她人很好  很漂亮
Yeah. I know. Look. She's nice, pretty.

728
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:37,620
那里能让你感到温暖  拉斯特
There's comfort there, Rust.

729
00:44:38,230 --> 00:44:40,050
你们俩会相处得很好
I think you guys would be good together

730
00:44:40,050 --> 00:44:41,500
只要你愿意一试
if you gave it a chance.

731
00:44:42,870 --> 00:44:45,840
你们从来不去尝试
You guys don't give things chances.

732
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:47,790
我真是搞不懂
I don't know why that is.

733
00:44:47,790 --> 00:44:50,230
那是因为我们清楚自己想要什么
That's because we know what we want

734
00:44:50,830 --> 00:44:53,070
而且不介意孑然一身
and we don't mind being alone.

735
00:44:55,890 --> 00:44:57,090
睡觉去吧  玛姬
Go to bed, Maggie.

736
00:44:58,790 --> 00:45:00,820
小马很快就会回家了  保重
Marty'll be home. Take care.

737
00:45:10,310 --> 00:45:12,600
老天爷  连续三天
Holy shit, 3 days in a row.

738
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:14,520
这是最新纪录吗
Is that a new personal record?

739
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:15,700
滚一边去
Fuck off.

740
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:18,170
别逼我到你家屋顶上拉屎
I will take my first shit through your sunroof.

741
00:45:18,170 --> 00:45:21,640
我好像找到了一条线索
Hey, hey, I found one, I think,

742
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:24,410
更早之前的一个女孩  过来
another girl from earlier. Come here.

743
00:45:28,510 --> 00:45:30,580
三年前  阿比维尔发生了洪灾
3 years ago, a flood in Abbeville,

744
00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:32,860
他们从河里捞出了这个女孩
they pulled this girl out of the river.

745
00:45:32,860 --> 00:45:33,550
等一下
Hold it.

746
00:45:33,550 --> 00:45:35,510
这上面说她的死是意外
It says here that her death was accidental--

747
00:45:35,510 --> 00:45:37,900
溺水  肺部进水
drowned, water in the lungs.

748
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:39,150
怎么会是被他害死的
How's that him?

749
00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:42,020
法医说是洪水中的树枝和碎石
Coroner says the branches and debris from the flood

750
00:45:42,020 --> 00:45:43,450
造成了这些伤痕
caused these injuries, all right?

751
00:45:43,450 --> 00:45:45,910
这能解释肋骨和胳膊上的伤痕
I understand the ribs and the arms,

752
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:46,930
但舌骨上的呢
but the hyoid?

753
00:45:46,930 --> 00:45:48,200
-还是不  -解释不了
- Still, that's not.. - No fucking way.

754
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:50,600
看这  腹部的撕裂伤
Look at this, lacerations to the abdomen,

755
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:53,550
还检测出她服用了冰毒和迷幻剂
plus she was positive for meth and LSD.

756
00:45:53,730 --> 00:45:56,160
他们说她磕了药  失足落水
They said she was high, fell in.

757
00:46:00,010 --> 00:46:01,400
看她的后背
Look at the posterior.

758
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:06,060
-老天爷  -没错
- Holy shit. - Yeah.

759
00:46:06,150 --> 00:46:07,910
她叫莉安·奥利弗
I.D.ed as Rianne Olivier--

760
00:46:07,910 --> 00:46:09,960
22岁  住在人口三百人的
22, lives in Pelican Island,

761
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:11,920
鹈鹕岛
population 300.

762
00:46:12,030 --> 00:46:15,520
祖父仍在世  住在一个码头上
Grandpa is still there, got a phone at the dock.

763
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:19,070
我可没法让人相信这东西
I don't know if I can sell this shit.

764
00:46:19,070 --> 00:46:21,740
我们就顺着这个线索查两天
Two days, we dig in this direction.

765
00:46:21,910 --> 00:46:24,870
如果这是他干的  那这就是原始手法
If this is his, it's some kind of archetype.

766
00:46:25,150 --> 00:46:27,350
维尔普拉特发现了一具机械师的尸体
DB, Ville Platt, machinist.

767
00:46:27,350 --> 00:46:28,180
你们去查
You're up.

768
00:46:28,180 --> 00:46:30,150
我们这案子有线索了  头儿
Hey, we caught a break in the case, boss.

769
00:46:30,950 --> 00:46:32,720
我以为你们已经不管那个案子了
I thought you were handing that off.

770
00:46:32,890 --> 00:46:33,990
什么线索
What break?

771
00:46:33,990 --> 00:46:36,450
和被害者有关系的一个人  可能知道凶手身份
KA of the victim. Might've known the killer, boss.

772
00:46:36,450 --> 00:46:38,260
可能看到过凶手  我们要去查查
Might've seen him. We follow up.

773
00:46:38,330 --> 00:46:41,090
我们还有几天时间
We still got a few days.

774
00:46:41,890 --> 00:46:44,360
就两天  然后将它交给特别小组
Two days, and it goes to task force.

775
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:45,940
你们俩再查机械师的案子
You two catch again.

776
00:46:48,230 --> 00:46:50,370
我们应该把连环杀手的想法跟他说说
We'll try that serial theory out on him,

777
00:46:50,370 --> 00:46:52,660
光凭不喜欢你这一点他就会把你撤掉
he will pull you just for spite.

778
00:46:52,660 --> 00:46:54,480
鹈鹕岛离这里两小时车程
Pelican Island is two hours away.

779
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:55,720
我们走吧
Here we go.

780
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:02,590
将你的手放到他的手上
Put your hand in his hand.

781
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:04,360
一个好的教堂会教你
The good church teaches that

782
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:06,620
基督教堂则不会教你
the Christian church does not teach that,

783
00:47:06,620 --> 00:47:09,060
天主教堂也不会...
the Catholic church does not--

784
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:23,680
假设一个男人可以同时爱上两个女人
Think a man can love two women at once,

785
00:47:24,370 --> 00:47:27,860
互相深爱的那种
I mean, be in love with them?

786
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:30,730
我觉得那个男人根本就不会爱
I don't think that man can love,

787
00:47:31,620 --> 00:47:33,720
至少不是他自以为的那种方式
at least not the way that he means.

788
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:37,610
现实生活中总有缺陷
Inadequacies of reality always set in.

789
00:47:40,170 --> 00:47:43,670
这些管道把这片土地分割得像拼图一样
This pipeline is carving up this coast like a jigsaw.

790
00:47:43,670 --> 00:47:46,560
三十年后这地方就会被水淹了
Place is gonna be underwater in 30 years.

791
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:52,750
你觉得...
Do you think--

792
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:58,200
你有没有怀疑过自己是个坏人
Do you wonder ever if you're a bad man?

793
00:47:59,650 --> 00:48:01,970
没有  我从不怀疑  小马
No. I don't wonder, Marty.

794
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:05,090
世界需要坏人
World needs bad men.

795
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:11,690
靠我们才能把其他坏人拒之门外
We keep the other bad men from the door.

796
00:48:49,330 --> 00:48:50,400
那就是他
That's him.

797
00:48:55,150 --> 00:48:57,460
你最后见到孙女是什么时候
When's the last time you saw your granddaughter?

798
00:48:59,190 --> 00:49:02,560
她四年前离家出走了  就像她妈妈一样
She left 4 years ago, like her ma.

799
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:05,770
她有那样的下场理所应当
Wasn't surprised they found her like that.

800
00:49:05,980 --> 00:49:09,340
每个人都认为他们会违背本性成为另一种人
Yeah. Everybody think they gonna be something they not.

801
00:49:09,340 --> 00:49:13,010
每个人  都打着这种算盘
Everybody, they got this big plan.

802
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:16,710
她有男朋友吗  某个男人
She had a boyfriend you know about, a man?

803
00:49:16,830 --> 00:49:19,950
她和勒杜家的一个好上了
Eh, she took up with that Ledoux fella --

804
00:49:19,950 --> 00:49:22,630
比她大  家境不好
older boy, shit family --

805
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:24,370
跟他私奔了
run off with him.

806
00:49:25,290 --> 00:49:28,210
还从没人问过我关于他的事
I ain't never had nobody ask me about him before.

807
00:49:28,470 --> 00:49:31,510
他只说她死于洪水
He just tell me she died in the flood.

808
00:49:31,780 --> 00:49:34,250
勒杜的家人还住在附近吗
That Ledoux family, they still live around here?

809
00:49:34,250 --> 00:49:36,830
或许还有几个表亲吧
Oh, maybe a cousin or two.

810
00:49:37,570 --> 00:49:39,250
一年比一年少了
Been shrinking every year.

811
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:43,200
大多都因为安德鲁飓风搬走了
Hurricane Andrew wiped most of the folks out around here.

812
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:46,650
知道勒杜叫什么吗
So you got a full name on that Ledoux boy?

813
00:49:47,890 --> 00:49:49,070
雷吉
Reggie.

814
00:49:49,860 --> 00:49:51,370
雷吉·勒杜
Reggie Ledoux.

815
00:49:51,910 --> 00:49:54,280
父亲叫巴特·勒杜
Father is Bart Ledoux --

816
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:57,020
醉鬼渔夫
works offshore, drunkard.

817
00:49:57,230 --> 00:49:59,690
听说他死了
I heard he died. Heh.

818
00:49:59,790 --> 00:50:01,610
莉安在哪里上的学
So where'd Rianne go to school?

819
00:50:01,660 --> 00:50:04,210
光明之路  在它关门之前
Light of Way when it was open.

820
00:50:04,210 --> 00:50:07,330
除了坐车去阿布维尔的孩子都去那上学
Kids either went there or they were bussed to Abbeville.

821
00:50:07,330 --> 00:50:11,360
州里规定两小时车程外才能做校车
State said a kid got to be bussed two hours away to school.

822
00:50:11,910 --> 00:50:14,350
我倒不是很在意他们
I ain't too big on them god botherers.

823
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:16,550
跟州里比起来政府
Between them and the government --

824
00:50:17,210 --> 00:50:19,630
她的父母呢  她还有其他亲戚吗
How about her parents, other relatives?

825
00:50:20,820 --> 00:50:22,940
父亲是个水手兼商人
Father is a merchant seaman.

826
00:50:23,230 --> 00:50:25,660
母亲去了加利福尼亚  就我所知
Mother is in California, last I heard.

827
00:50:25,710 --> 00:50:28,210
你有没有她的东西
Do you have anything of hers -- possessions,

828
00:50:28,210 --> 00:50:31,840
能让我们了解一下
anything that'd give us

829
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:33,930
她是个什么样的人
an idea what she might have been like?

830
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:38,000
你们调查这些干什么
What you boys looking all this up for?

831
00:50:38,550 --> 00:50:40,850
她不是在洪水里淹死的吗
I was told she drowned in the flood.

832
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:43,520
我也不傻的
Now, I ain't no idiot.

833
00:50:43,570 --> 00:50:45,810
难道她不是被淹死的
You telling me she ain't done drowned?

834
00:50:46,180 --> 00:50:47,820
我们还不确定  先生
We don't know that, sir.

835
00:50:47,820 --> 00:50:50,250
我们只是在找可能认识她的一个男人
We're just looking for a man who might have known her.

836
00:50:51,170 --> 00:50:52,210
哪个
Who?

837
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:54,750
我们也想知道
That's what we're trying to figure out.

838
00:50:55,850 --> 00:50:59,000
他有一盒她的东西
He ended up having a little box of her stuff,

839
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,850
10年级的同学录
had her last yearbook, tenth grade,

840
00:51:02,830 --> 00:51:05,270
老人的话完全听不出什么
not a hint of feeling from the old man,

841
00:51:06,020 --> 00:51:09,080
简直是盲人摸象
kind of got blinders,

842
00:51:10,060 --> 00:51:12,760
可他为什么留着那盒东西
but why'd he keep the box, huh?

843
00:51:13,460 --> 00:51:15,170
他自己知道吗
Did he ask himself?

844
00:51:17,570 --> 00:51:20,540
不管怎样  我想那是一种忘记的方式
Anyway, I guess, that's one way to do it --

845
00:51:20,540 --> 00:51:23,220
一门心思放在蟹笼上
keep your eyes on the crab traps.

846
00:51:24,570 --> 00:51:27,390
让我想起了拉斯特
Kind of reminded me of Rust a little bit.

847
00:51:32,110 --> 00:51:32,620
学校不大
This school is small,

848
00:51:32,620 --> 00:51:34,970
{\an8}光明之路  10年级

849
00:51:34,970 --> 00:51:36,660
1到12年级都有
grades one through 12.

850
00:51:39,190 --> 00:51:43,820
莉安·奥利弗  在这  10年级
Rianne Olivier. Here she is, tenth grade.

851
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:51,080
{\an8}非营利教会  由塔特尔教会思源计划赞助

852
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:53,390
学校隶属塔特尔基金会
This school was part of Tuttle's foundation.

853
00:52:15,470 --> 00:52:16,610
下午好
Good afternoon.

854
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:17,730
下午好
Afternoon.

855
00:52:18,020 --> 00:52:20,360
这里92年就关闭了对吧
This place shut down '92, right?

856
00:52:21,220 --> 00:52:23,010
我听说好像是这么回事
Yeah, the way I heard it.

857
00:52:23,010 --> 00:52:24,160
你听说过什么
What'd you hear?

858
00:52:25,090 --> 00:52:26,630
都是安德鲁飓风
Oh, Andrew blew it out.

859
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:30,680
可能他们觉得打扫这是白费劲吧
Guess they didn't think it was worth cleaning up.

860
00:52:31,530 --> 00:52:33,060
你在这工作吗
Do you work here, then?

861
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:35,540
不  长官  教区雇的我
No, sir. I work for the parish,

862
00:52:35,540 --> 00:52:37,550
我要打理好几处呢
cover several properties.

863
00:52:38,670 --> 00:52:40,170
I-23
I-23?

864
00:52:43,290 --> 00:52:44,840
I-23收到  请指示
I-23. Go.

865
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:46,870
记录鉴定部门有回复了
I've got comeback on your R&I.

866
00:52:46,870 --> 00:52:51,140
雷金纳德·勒杜  1960年11月13日出生
Reginald Ledoux -- DOB 11/13/60.

867
00:52:51,140 --> 00:52:53,180
你知道当时还有谁
You know anybody who went here

868
00:52:53,180 --> 00:52:54,810
来过这或者在这工作吗
or worked here back then?

869
00:52:55,260 --> 00:52:57,890
没了  长官
Mm, no, sir.

870
00:52:57,890 --> 00:53:00,720
我才来了几个月
I only been coming here the last few months.

871
00:53:00,870 --> 00:53:03,410
教区刚把这里分给我
Parish added it to my work order.

872
00:53:11,710 --> 00:53:13,030
感谢你抽出时间
Thank you for your time.

873
00:53:17,620 --> 00:53:19,750
谁走路会这么慢啊
Who walks that fucking slow?

874
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:23,450
有消息了
What you got?

875
00:53:24,610 --> 00:53:25,820
记录鉴定有回复了
R&I just came back.

876
00:53:25,820 --> 00:53:28,830
雷金·勒杜8个月前逃离了假释
Reggie Ledoux skipped parole 8 months ago.

877
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:30,760
身上一堆案底  被控强奸
He's got a stat. Rape complaint,

878
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:34,040
后来被撤诉  但是93年再次被捕
charges dropped, but '93, he's busted

879
00:53:34,050 --> 00:53:36,220
这次和一个毒品实验室有关
in connection to a narcotics lab

880
00:53:36,220 --> 00:53:38,140
它们制造冰毒和迷幻药
used to make meth and LSD,

881
00:53:38,140 --> 00:53:40,820
正是朵拉·兰和莉安身上查出的毒品
which Dora Lange and Rianne were full of.

882
00:53:40,820 --> 00:53:42,170
继续
Right.

883
00:53:42,250 --> 00:53:44,110
勒杜在阿沃伊斯蹲了两年
Ledoux did two years at Avoyelles,

884
00:53:44,110 --> 00:53:47,300
猜猜他最后四个月的室友是谁
and guess who his cellmate was the last 4 months.

885
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:48,710
查理·兰
Charlie Lange.

886
00:53:49,370 --> 00:53:51,200
这回我必须承认你说对了
I got to give you this one.

887
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:54,590
我开始相信
I started to believe you were going

888
00:53:54,590 --> 00:53:56,020
你没那么疯了
a little off your nut.

889
00:53:56,020 --> 00:53:58,920
你确实是个疯子  但是这件事上没疯
I mean, you're bonkers, just not on this.

890
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:00,290
好吧  那勒杜在哪儿
All right. Where was Ledoux?

891
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:02,990
我拿到了一份亲属和联系人名单
Getting a list of relatives, KAs.

892
00:54:02,990 --> 00:54:05,440
自从他假释期脱逃后就没人见到过他
Been out of pocket since jumping parole.

893
00:54:05,450 --> 00:54:06,600
我们会找到他的
We'll find him.

894
00:54:06,690 --> 00:54:07,840
这下就能说通了
This makes sense.

895
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:08,960
情况不错  宝贝儿
Looks good, baby.

896
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:10,530
我们现在正赶去
All right. We are on our way.

897
00:54:10,530 --> 00:54:11,630
阿沃伊斯
To Avoyelles.

898
00:54:11,630 --> 00:54:13,400
太棒了  马丁  我们走
Fuck, yeah, Martin. Let's go.

899
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:14,490
我把情况通报给联邦执法部
I'm calling the interstate APB

900
00:54:14,490 --> 00:54:16,540
再发一份通缉令
and the U.S. Marshals on this.

901
00:54:16,540 --> 00:54:18,440
I-23呼叫总部
I-23 to dispatch.

902
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:19,770
收到  I-23
Come in, I-23.

903
00:54:19,770 --> 00:54:21,030
我能说什么呢
What can I say?

904
00:54:21,030 --> 00:54:22,070
我原来以为你就是喜欢
I thought for a minute, you just liked looking

905
00:54:22,070 --> 00:54:23,500
看死人的照片
at pictures of dead people.

906
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:26,390
我要发布一份通缉令  对象是雷金纳德·勒杜
I need an all-state APB on one Reginald Ledoux.

907
00:54:26,390 --> 00:54:28,030
记录鉴定部门查到了线索
R&I came back with info.

908
00:54:28,030 --> 00:54:29,820
请通告联邦执法部和高速巡警
All U.S. Marshals and Highway Patrol,

909
00:54:29,820 --> 00:54:32,140
一经发现  立即扣押  完毕
be advised, detain on sight, over.

910
00:54:32,140 --> 00:54:33,320
收到  警探
Roger that, detective.

911
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:35,090
消息已经发出去了
We've got that sent now.

912
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:40,340
最终
And finally,

913
00:54:40,580 --> 00:54:45,440
我们找到了雷金纳德·勒杜
we arrive at Reginald Ledoux.

914
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:51,080
快点  伙计们
Come on, man.

915
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:54,550
你们想问什么就问吧
You want to ask me, ask, goddamn it.

916
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,040
你遇到过枪战吗
You ever been in a gunfight?

917
00:54:58,520 --> 00:54:59,540
没有
No.

918
00:55:00,690 --> 00:55:01,940
那你们又他妈怎么理解
Well, then how the fuck you gonna know

919
00:55:01,940 --> 00:55:03,410
我说得事情
what I'm talking about?

920
00:55:06,390 --> 00:55:10,460
那地方  我从来
Man, that place-- I never--

921
00:55:11,990 --> 00:55:15,480
那天  那地方让我想起我爸经常提到的越南
That day, it reminded me of my pop talking about 'Nam

922
00:55:16,870 --> 00:55:18,700
和丛林战
and the jungle thing.

923
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:23,650
我现在跟你们说当时发生了什么
Look. Me talking about what happened back then,

924
00:55:23,740 --> 00:55:26,320
对你们也没什么帮助
that ain't gonna do you any good now.

925
00:55:29,700 --> 00:55:30,860
这个
This--

926
00:55:32,690 --> 00:55:34,710
这个才是我要说的
This is what I'm talking about.

927
00:55:36,260 --> 00:55:37,760
我每次说到时间
This is what I mean

928
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:41,860
死亡  和无效尝试时
when I'm talking about time and death

929
00:55:42,110 --> 00:55:43,590
我指的就是这个
and futility.

930
00:55:44,940 --> 00:55:47,320
工作时会有更多的想法
There are broader ideas at work,

931
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:50,220
这些想法来自于  人类整体作为一个社会
mainly what is owed between us as a society

932
00:55:50,220 --> 00:55:52,280
所持有的相同的错觉
for our mutual illusions.

933
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:55,320
盯着尸体看上十四个小时
14 straight hours of staring at DBs,

934
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:58,490
你就会想到这些事情
these are the things you think of.

935
00:55:59,980 --> 00:56:03,600
你做过吗
You ever done that?

936
00:56:03,970 --> 00:56:08,080
你注视着他们的眼睛  即使只是照片
You look in their eyes, even in a picture.

937
00:56:08,090 --> 00:56:10,150
他们是死是活都无关紧要
Doesn't matter if they're dead or alive.

938
00:56:10,150 --> 00:56:13,560
你都能读出你要的信息  知道你会看出什么吗
You can still read them, and you know what you see?

939
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:17,440
你会看出他们也乐意你这么做
They welcomed it,

940
00:56:19,130 --> 00:56:22,370
也许一开始不会
mm-hmm, not at first,

941
00:56:23,310 --> 00:56:25,370
但是到了最后一刻总会如此
but right there in the last instant.

942
00:56:25,370 --> 00:56:29,980
很明显这是一种解脱  因为他们原先会害怕
It's an unmistakable relief, see, because they were afraid

943
00:56:29,980 --> 00:56:32,580
然后他们会第一次发现
and now they saw for the very first time

944
00:56:32,580 --> 00:56:35,970
放手是如此简单
how easy it was to just let go,

945
00:56:37,350 --> 00:56:39,920
而在那最后一刻  他们会看到
and they saw -- in that last nanosecond,

946
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:43,320
他们会看清自己
they saw what they were,

947
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:46,930
你  你自己  和这一系列闹剧
that you, yourself, this whole big drama,

948
00:56:46,930 --> 00:56:49,290
不过是粗劣的假设和愚蠢的愿望
it was never anything but a jerry-rig

949
00:56:49,290 --> 00:56:54,270
而现在你可以放手了
of presumption and dumb will and you could just let go

950
00:56:54,620 --> 00:56:57,790
反正已经无需再坚持
finally now that you didn't have to hold on so tight...

951
00:56:59,590 --> 00:57:04,170
也不用去管你的生活
to realize that all your life--

952
00:57:04,450 --> 00:57:06,120
你的爱恨与纠葛 
you know, all your love, all your hate,

953
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:09,890
你的回忆与苦痛  都是一体
all your memory, all your pain-- it was all the same thing.

954
00:57:10,030 --> 00:57:13,110
都是同一个梦  一个你在密室中
It was all the same dream, a dream that you had

955
00:57:13,110 --> 00:57:15,080
才会做的梦
inside a locked room,

956
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:22,130
一个关于如何做人的梦
a dream about being a person...

957
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:32,290
和许多其他的梦一样
and like a lot of dreams...

958
00:57:38,140 --> 00:57:40,620
梦的最后  都有一头怪物
there's a monster at the end of it.
