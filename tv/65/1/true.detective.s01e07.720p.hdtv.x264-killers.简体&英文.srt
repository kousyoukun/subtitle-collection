前情提要

18
00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:03,290
2002年出了些事
Something went down, 2002.

19
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:04,700
你前夫的搭档
Your ex-husband's partner,

20
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:05,570
拉斯丁·科尔
Rustin Cohle.

21
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:07,450
我认识的拉斯特是个好人
I knew Rust to be a good man,

22
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:09,300
所以我不知道我有什么好说的
so I can't imagine what I can offer.

23
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:12,860
我是唯一一个支持你的人
I'm the only one ever took up for you.

24
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:14,750
不  老弟  没有我
No, buddy, without me...

25
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:16,970
也不会有你
there is no you.

26
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:18,820
那个带疤的
The man

27
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:20,350
男人
with the scars,

28
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:21,770
他逼着我看
he made me watch

29
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:23,680
他对比利做的一切
what he did to Billy.

30
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:24,990
我们为什么谈起这个呢
What's this all about now?

31
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:26,520
因为死了女人和儿童
Dead women and children.

32
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:28,630
你的搭档  他骚扰了比利·李·塔特尔
Your partner here, he braced Billy Lee Tuttle.

33
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:30,450
这就是我所说的
This is exactly what I'm talking about.

34
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:32,510
如果他因为我们的谈话而大发雷霆
If he was pissed off after the conversation we had,

35
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:33,930
那就说明我的调查方向是对的
then I am on to something.

36
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:37,090
我真的很想见你
I really wanted to see you.

37
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:37,760
{\an8}请稍等

38
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:39,780
我看到你手机上的照片了
I saw the pictures on your phone.

39
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:42,350
我控制不了某些疯婆子给我发
I cannot help it if some crazy bitch sent--

40
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:43,810
我和别人上床了
I slept with someone.

41
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:45,560
拉斯特
It was Rust.

42
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:49,650
我辞职
I quit.

43
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:50,860
你当真吗
You serious?

44
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:54,050
我觉得也许我们该谈谈
Thought maybe we should talk.

45
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:56,430
行  你带路
Sure. I'll follow you.

46
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:29,050
{\an8}真探
第一季第七集

47
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:06,210
你看起来还不错
You look like you're doing all right.

48
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:11,170
时光老人对我们自有一套
Father Time has his way with us all.

49
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:15,020
你看起来到像是惹毛他了
Looks like you must have pissed him off.

50
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,030
我们来这儿要干嘛
Why we here?

51
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,350
我对州警察部门在问的事
I got a thing

52
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,700
有点想法
the State PD's asking about.

53
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:33,920
查尔斯湖谋杀案
The Lake Charles murder.

54
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,740
都这个时候了
I mean, shouldn't it have been in the paper

55
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:38,700
难道不是应该已经结案了吗
to draw a line somewhere by now?

56
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:42,660
我们不能相信他们
I mean, we can't trust them.

57
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:44,970
如果他们连这种事都想掩盖
And, I mean, if they're gonna cover something like that up,

58
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:46,740
谁知道他们还掩盖了什么事
who knows what else they've covered up?

59
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:48,710
你怎么认为
What you think?

60
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:53,030
我认为你看起来很不健康
I think you don't look particularly healthy.

61
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:55,460
你的说话方式
Listening to you talk,

62
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,270
你的眼睛  看起来
your eyes, you seem

63
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,810
你已经到极限了  拉斯特
kind of brittle, Rust.

64
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:04,220
过去十年里大多数时间我都烂醉如泥
Most of the last decade I spent stone-drunk.

65
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:07,260
还能动弹  但是影响很大
Functional, but hammered.

66
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:09,190
回阿拉斯加待了八年
Went back to Alaska,

67
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:12,610
打渔  调酒
spent 8 years working fishing boats, bars.

68
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:15,760
-我还以为你不喜欢天冷  -我讨厌天冷
- Oh, I thought you didn't like the cold. - I hate it.

69
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,200
2010年
And then I come back here

70
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,570
我第一次回来路易斯安那
to Louisiana for the first time in 2010.

71
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:20,850
为什么回来
And why is that?

72
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:24,750
和我现在坐在你对面的原因一样
The same reason I'm sitting across the table from you now.

73
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:28,230
男人不会忘了他欠得债
A man remembers his debts.

74
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:32,410
我不喜欢细数过去
I don't dwell on the past.

75
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,970
那感觉一定很好
Well, it must be nice.

76
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:38,270
不管你认为你欠我什么  我都不感兴趣
I'm not interested in whatever it is you think you owe me.

77
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:39,730
我不欠你什么
Oh, I don't owe you.

78
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,950
而是我们有事没做完
We left something undone.

79
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:44,900
我们必须做完
We got to fix it,

80
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:47,420
我这两年一直在忙这事
and I've been working on this for two years.

81
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:48,760
我  一个人
Me, myself.

82
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:51,130
从来没找过你  从来没麻烦过你
Never called you, I never bothered you with it--

83
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:53,660
是啊  你为什么会找我  操  你都做了些什么
Yeah, why would you? Shit, man, what did you do?

84
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:56,030
你疏远你生命中的每个人
Alienate every other person in your life,

85
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:58,610
然后最终又回来找我
and then finally you came back to me in the rotation?

86
00:04:58,610 --> 00:04:59,620
不是我要指责什么
You know, not for nothing,

87
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:01,380
但是如果你当时没干掉勒杜
but if you wouldn't have clipped Ledoux back then,

88
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:03,840
也许我们已经把整件事弄清楚了
we might have got the whole fucking story out of him.

89
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:09,170
我把酒喝完就走
You know, I think I'm gonna finish this beer and say so long.

90
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:11,190
我最近已经不怎么喝酒了
Now, I'm not much of a drinker nowadays.

91
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:14,330
事实上  遇到你之前我已经三周没喝了
In fact, I hadn't had a drop in 3 weeks till I ran into you.

92
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:16,420
我不需要你喝酒  小马
Well, I don't need you to drink, Marty.

93
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,720
-我需要你帮我  -我为什么要帮你
- I need you to help me. - Why would I?

94
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,860
他们说你无法证明自己在哪里
They say you can't account for your time.

95
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:23,260
并且有目击证人看到你在
They got eyewitnesses placing you

96
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:25,250
查尔斯湖犯罪现场出现
at the Lake Charles crime scene.

97
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:28,150
你有个仓库却不肯让他们查看
You got some storage shed that you won't let them look at.

98
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:29,460
-没错  -为什么不
- That's right. - Why not?

99
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:32,000
为什么不跟他们合作  你是清白的
Why not shoot straight with them? You're innocent.

100
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,850
别让他们再浪费时间了
Help them stop wasting their time.

101
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:34,990
什么时候开始
Fucking since when did guilt

102
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,400
由州警察部门决定谁清白谁有罪了
and innocence define the State PD, huh?

103
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,320
去他妈的
Come the fuck on.

104
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:41,420
我不知道这事铺得有多大
Now, I don't know the sprawl of this thing, all right?

105
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:43,200
我所调查的那些人  都要完了
The people I'm after, they're all fucking over.

106
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,590
他们牵涉进了很多事
They're in a lot of different things,

107
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:47,900
也牵扯出了很多人
pieces, family trees.

108
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,330
只有让你亲眼看到
The only way for you to understand

109
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:52,390
你才会明白我在说什么
what I'm on to here is for me to show you.

110
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:54,350
你得来看看我查出了什么
You got to come see what I got.

111
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:56,690
不
No. You know what?

112
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:59,220
你还没搞清楚  拉斯特
I don't think I've been very clear with you, Rust.

113
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:00,740
如果你溺水了
If you were drowning,

114
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:03,170
我会扔副杠铃帮你沉下去
I'd throw you a fucking barbell.

115
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:06,730
我为什么要帮你
Why would I ever help you?

116
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,950
因为你有债要还
Because you have a debt.

117
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:27,170
你真是脑子有问题
You got some fucking sack.

118
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:30,200
你什么意思  我有什么债要还
What's that mean, I have a debt, huh?

119
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:33,290
95年发生的那事
Means the way shit went down in '95,

120
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:35,580
你也有责任  伙计
this is on you, too, buddy.

121
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:45,880
你有什么要给我看的
What do you got to show me?

122
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,320
你带了什么
What you packing?

123
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:08,250
点38手枪
.38.

124
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:11,610
空尖弹
Hollow-point?

125
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:13,380
是的
Yeah.

126
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,930
够用了
That'd do it.

127
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,030
小心点总不是坏事
You never be too careful.

128
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:36,970
{\an8}黄袍国王  伤疤男  卡寇莎

129
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:44,120
好了
All right.

130
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:47,230
记住  没有实物证据
Remember, there was no physical evidence

131
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:51,220
可以将朵拉·兰和勒杜森林里的小屋联系起来
connecting Dora Lange to Ledoux's place out in the woods,

132
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,130
说明那里也许不是案发现场
meaning it probably didn't happen out there.

133
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:55,540
从来没人提过这事
Nobody was in a hurry to bring that up.

134
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:59,510
第二  女人和小孩失踪了
Two--women and children gone missing,

135
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:02,530
全部发生在塔特尔教会思源计划资助的学校
all taken from areas within a 10-mile radius

136
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:05,940
周围16公里范围之内
of schools that were funded by Tuttle's Wellspring initiative.

137
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,570
我们要找到联系
We establish a connection.

138
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:09,510
谁有问题  谁是干净的
Who's in, who's out, you know?

139
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:10,940
州里其他地区失踪人数相近吗
I mean, do people disappear

140
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:13,510
失踪人数相近吗
in equal numbers in other parts of the state?

141
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:16,010
-一共有多少所学校  -14所
- How many schools were there? - 14.

142
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:18,530
我大体上查过了
Now, I've covered a surface area.

143
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:20,930
我查了州里离家出走
I pulled runaways in state

144
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:22,550
和失踪人员清单  你会注意到
and missing persons, and if you'll notice,

145
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:24,430
沿河区域的数字是其他地区的两倍
there's twice as many along the bayous.

146
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:25,430
我也不知道为什么
I don't know why.

147
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:28,080
我们得好好调查一下这为什么
Hell, someone should do a study as to why.

148
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,390
你现在只是在列数字
Well, now you're just throwing up stats.

149
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:33,470
为什么塔特尔会对兰的案子这么感兴趣
Why was Tuttle so interested in the Lange case, huh?

150
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:36,520
还记得查理·兰说的勒杜跟他说过的话吗
Remember Charlie Lange said what Ledoux told him?

151
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:39,400
他说有一群人  他们拿人做祭品
Said there's a group of men, sacrifices.

152
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,910
我认为塔特尔认出了那个场景
Well, I think Tuttle recognized the scene.

153
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:42,960
所以他才会那么快就赶来
That's why he came down

154
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,890
还带了个特别小组
there jiminy quick with a fucking task force,

155
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:47,530
所以我02年和他谈过之后他才会离开
and that's why he tripped out when I talked to him in '02.

156
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:49,420
那到底发生了什么
OK, so what happened to him?

157
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:52,190
你这里这些东西
I mean, I'm looking around here,

158
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:54,790
没有任何一件可以证明
and I don't see or hear anything

159
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,140
你不是在妄加猜测
that doesn't make this all conjectural.

160
00:09:58,210 --> 00:10:00,140
1988年
1988.

161
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:03,420
塔特尔资助的一家幼儿园
Accusations of child molestation

162
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:05,590
被指控有猥亵儿童的行为
at a preschool funded by Tuttle.

163
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:08,280
那所幼儿园叫牧羊人之家
Name of that school is Shepherd's Flock.

164
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:11,700
当时被关闭了  两年后在鹈鹕岛重新开张
It shuts down, reopens two years later on Pelican Island

165
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:14,500
名字叫光明之路学院
under the name Light of the Way Academy,

166
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,370
莉安·奥利弗就在那里上的学
where Rianne Olivier went.

167
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:19,740
我弄到了登记表  班上有16个孩子
And I got an enrollment list-- 16 kids in the class.

168
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,180
其中一个后来在新奥尔良
One of them turned out to be a young man who'd just showed up

169
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:24,460
因为卖淫而受过审
for solicitation in New Orleans.

170
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:31,940
那是2010年
Now, this is 2010.

171
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:34,800
他叫托比·伯莱尔
His name is Toby Boelert.

172
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:36,920
化名强尼·乔妮
Goes by the name of Johnny Joanie.

173
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:48,170
牧羊人之家
Shepherd's Flock?

174
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:52,340
你为什么会问这个地方
Why are you asking me about that place?

175
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:53,840
那学校关闭之后
You know, after that place shut down,

176
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,940
有很多风言风语
there was a lot of talk going around.

177
00:10:57,850 --> 00:10:59,310
你见过那个牧师吗
You ever see that reverend...

178
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:02,070
比利·李·塔特尔
Billy Lee Tuttle, around?

179
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,490
应该见过  但是谁记得那么久的事呢
You know, I think so, but who can remember way back?

180
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,420
都是这么回事
That's how it all started.

181
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,340
记性总是先出问题
Memory be fucked.

182
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:13,960
我决定把那一切都当做是在做梦
I decided it all had to be a dream anyways,

183
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:15,650
我不记得它
and I don't remember if it...

184
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:20,390
我们晚上会睡觉
We'd go to sleep,

185
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,220
但是有时我觉得不像是在睡觉
only sometimes I didn't feel like I was asleep.

186
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:26,660
感觉像是醒着  但是我又一定是在睡觉
I felt like I was still awake, but I must have been asleep

187
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:28,160
因为我不能动
because I couldn't move.

188
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:33,020
就像是闭着眼却能看见东西
Just...sort of see under my eyelids.

189
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,600
然后呢
And what?

190
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,210
我不知道
I don't know.

191
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:39,090
有很多人
There were men...

192
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,840
在拍照
taking pictures.

193
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,550
有时
Sometimes...

194
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:47,110
会做其他事
other things.

195
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,850
都是些什么人
Who were they?

196
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:50,340
我不知道
I don't know.

197
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:52,750
都长着动物脸
They had animal faces.

198
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:55,540
所以我才决定把这一切当做是做梦
That's why I decided it had to be a dream.

199
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:58,920
他们都长着动物脸  那一定是在做梦
They had animal faces, well, it had to be a dream.

200
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,200
有其他小孩见过吗
Any other kids see this?

201
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:02,960
一个小女孩见过
One girl.

202
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:05,300
我不记得她叫什么名字了
I don't remember her name.

203
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:07,440
是她先说起来的
She first started talking about it.

204
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:10,440
她也看到了那些脸
And she seen it, too, the faces.

205
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,640
我不记得她叫什么名字了
I do not remember her name.

206
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,100
玛丽·方特诺特
Marie Fontenot?

207
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:17,180
也许吧
Maybe.

208
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,370
你见过那些人的真容吗
You ever see any of these men's faces?

209
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,550
见过一次
Once.

210
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:23,860
他们不是每个人都长着动物脸
They didn't all have animal faces.

211
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:28,410
有三个年轻人  我不记得是谁了
Three younger men. I don't remember them.

212
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:30,280
其中一个
Just one.

213
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,010
他嘴唇附近全是伤疤
He had bad scars all around his mouth,

214
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:36,480
好像下半张脸全被烧毁了
like the bottom half got all burned up.

215
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,440
我把那个人也当做做梦了
I thought that man, he was a dream, too.

216
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:48,720
不  我不认为那是在做梦
No, I don't think he was a dream.

217
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:51,150
我糊涂了
I don't understand.

218
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:52,100
你的意思是
Are you saying that you think

219
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:55,200
这个假想的杀手
that this hypothetical killer

220
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:58,310
曾经是个学校教师
was, uh, an old schoolteacher?

221
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:01,390
或是和州警察部门有关
Or it might what, involve State PD?

222
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:04,440
老天啊  你怎么了
Goddamn. What happened to you, man?

223
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,730
还记得他吗
Remember him?

224
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:09,540
记得
Yeah.

225
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:12,830
那是我们在伊拉斯查的案子
Yeah. You and I were on the case in Erath.

226
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:15,520
有个女孩说她被一个长着绿耳朵的意面怪
Girl comes forward and says she was chased through the woods

227
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,880
追进了树林
by a spaghetti monster with green ears.

228
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,360
我觉得那就是
Now, I think that this is our man

229
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,320
脸上有伤疤的那个男人
with the scars on his face.

230
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:26,130
17年前就有三例证明了
We got 3 references 17 years ago: that old

231
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:29,130
复兴教会的人说有个脸上有疤的高个男子来过
revival church said a tall man with scars came through,

232
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:30,990
医院里的凯莉·瑞德
Kelly Reider in the hospital,

233
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:33,740
还有那个妓男  托比
and now this hooker from the quarter--Toby.

234
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:35,110
我不知道他是谁
I don't know who he is,

235
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:36,310
我不知道他在哪里  我不知道这些事的源头
I don't know where he is, I don't know where

236
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:39,550
在哪儿  但是找到他就能解开这一切
this whole thing fucking starts, but it ends with him.

237
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,800
你还记得伊拉斯附近的那个小镇吗
All right, you know the little township down around Erath?

238
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,270
塔特尔家就来自那里
All right, that's where the Tuttle family is from.

239
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:49,740
那本来只是个藏匿之所
Now, it used to be a pirate hideout,

240
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,540
后来变成了农场之类的
then turned into plantations and whatnot.

241
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:55,850
那里有乡村风味的狂欢节
Had a very rural sense of Mardi Gras, uh,

242
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:59,110
骑马  动物面具  诸如此类
you know, the men on horses, animals masks, such.

243
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:01,670
-惭悔星期二  -没错
- Courir de Mardi Gras. - That's right.

244
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,570
他们每年都会有冬至节
Now, they had an annual winter festival.

245
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:06,640
在萨特纳里亚尤其盛行
Went heavy on the Saturnalia, a place where

246
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:09,750
在那里桑泰里厄教和伏都教融合在一起
that Santeria and Voudon all mash together.

247
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:10,960
看这里
Have a look.

248
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:12,920
从冬至节
From the winter festival.

249
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:15,440
眼罩
Blindfold...

250
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:18,680
鹿角  面具
antlers, mask.

251
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:23,820
这是卡特里娜飓风之后
I got these from a series an artist did in Kenner,

252
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:25,480
肯纳的一个艺术家的系列创作之一
right after Katrina.

253
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:28,100
他说一直看到这些被他称为
Says he kept running across these "stick things,"

254
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,320
"棍子搭成的物品"的东西
as he called them.

255
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:31,640
眼熟吗
Look familiar?

256
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:36,470
看来我们要找的人在飓风之后"快活"了一阵
Think our man had a real good time after the hurricane--

257
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:37,840
各种混乱
chaos,

258
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,690
有人失踪  有人离开
people missing, and people gone.

259
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:41,230
警察走了
Cops gone.

260
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:44,010
我觉得他有一个好年景
I think he had a real good year.

261
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:46,580
你要我做什么
What do you need me for?

262
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,610
你在警局有朋友
You got friends on the force.

263
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:53,170
你有数据库的访问权而我没有
You have access that I don't, databases.

264
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,810
我需要案卷
I need case files.

265
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:56,820
失踪人口  谋杀案
I need missing persons. I need homicides.

266
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:59,450
汽车和房屋的所有权转让的档案
I need title transfers, auto and home.

267
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:00,350
我有一份名单
I got a list of names.

268
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:02,350
我需要他们的背景调查  税务记录
I'm gonna need background checks, tax records,

269
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:04,290
任何能让我们抓住勒杜的线索
anything we can get on Ledoux.

270
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:05,980
天呐  伙计
Jesus Christ, man.

271
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:07,030
要是州警没有把我扯进查尔斯湖的案子
I wouldn't have called you

272
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:08,530
我也不会给你打电话
and I wouldn't have fucking bothered you

273
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:11,190
我不想打扰你
if State wouldn't have pulled me in on this Lake Charles case.

274
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:12,730
要是你需要帮忙
Well, if you need help,

275
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:15,570
为什么不把这些给帕帕尼亚和吉尔包
why don't you just give it to Papania and Gilbough?

276
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:18,240
不  他们只是一枚棋子  自己还没发觉
No, they may be pawns in this thing and not even fucking know it.

277
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:22,010
-得了吧  -埃迪·塔特尔是这个州的参议员
- Come on. - Look, Eddie Tuttle is the goddamn senator of this state.

278
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:25,130
已故的比利·李·塔特尔牧师是他的堂亲
The late Reverend Billy Lee Tuttle is his cousin.

279
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:27,120
我跟你说  这就是家族事务
I'm telling you, it's a fucking family thing.

280
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,530
我跟你说事情不简单就是这意思  小马
That's what I mean when I talk about the sprawl, Marty!

281
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:30,820
埃迪·塔特尔是查尔斯湖的案子
Eddie Tuttle's the reason

282
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:32,370
一直没法结案的原因所在
that the Lake Charles thing never made the wire.

283
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:35,560
伙计  你这里有强有力的证据
Look, man, you have some compelling stuff here

284
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,390
而且你可能真的有些调查方向
and you might have something,

285
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:39,020
但是...
but...

286
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:43,080
所有的这些  你所谓的
all this--this--the "sprawl,"

287
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,960
"麻烦事"  我称之为猜想
as you call it, which I would call conjecture,

288
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,750
这个有关塔特尔  州警的破事
this shit about the Tuttles, the State PD.

289
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:53,020
你知道这听上去多么疯狂
Do you know how fucking crazy that sounds?

290
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:55,040
就像你孤单一人太久了
It's like you've been alone too long, you know,

291
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:58,470
你给自己讲了这个故事
like you maybe told yourself this story

292
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:01,390
还不停地喝酒  直到你自己相信了它
and kept drinking until you believed it.

293
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,530
小马...
Marty...

294
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:09,950
我曾花了很久来确认这些是否只是我的幻想
I had my time where I wondered if this was all in my head.

295
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:13,620
那都是过去的事了
That time passed.

296
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,780
真的吗
Really?

297
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:23,540
比利·李·塔特尔怎么了
What happened to Billy Lee Tuttle?

298
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:29,210
这有些东西你得看看
There's something you're gonna have to look at.

299
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:32,750
不看没法理解
No other way around it.

300
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:39,400
你还喝清咖吗
You still take your coffee black?

301
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:42,140
绿茶  要是你有的话
Oh, uh, green tea, if you have it.

302
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:44,340
我一直在努力戒咖啡
I've been trying to stay away from coffee,

303
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:46,720
稍微健康一点
you know, a little bit healthier.

304
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,790
那梅斯从芝加哥回来了吗
So, Mace--is she, uh, back from Chicago yet?

305
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:52,510
嗯  三个月前回的
Mm-hmm, 3 months ago.

306
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:54,010
三个月
3 months.

307
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:57,960
那是什么  那个…
Uh...and what was it, that--

308
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,250
美利坚志愿团
Americorps.

309
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:01,560
就是教书
Teaching.

310
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:03,820
奥德丽  她怎么样了
And Audrey, how--how's she?

311
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:06,120
她现在很好
She's fine, at the moment.

312
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:09,840
她有时会自己决定不吃药
She sometimes decides she doesn't need her meds.

313
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:11,810
我喜欢她男朋友
I like her boyfriend.

314
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:13,570
他很小心地照顾着她
He watches out for her.

315
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:16,310
她在新奥尔良开了场艺术展
She had an art show in New Orleans,

316
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:18,080
卖了几幅画
sold some paintings.

317
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,950
不错啊  那很好
Oh, that's good. That's great.

318
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:22,490
我也该买一幅
I should buy one,

319
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:24,240
如果我买得起的话
I mean, if I can afford it.

320
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:30,920
我来这是因为…
So the reason I, uh...

321
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,820
就像我在电话里说的
I mean, like I said on the phone, I...

322
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:36,620
我想问你几个关于那些警察的问题
I want to ask you about those cops.

323
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,720
他们只是想知道你和拉斯特的事
They just wanted to know about you and Rust.

324
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:42,150
主要是拉斯特
Mostly Rust.

325
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:44,020
他们想知道
They wanted to know about

326
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:46,890
你们02年那场架
the fight in '02.

327
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,900
你告诉他们了吗
Mmm, did you tell them?

328
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:53,110
没有
No...

329
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:55,940
但他们觉得拉斯特做了什么
but they think Rust did something.

330
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:58,580
我知道
I know.

331
00:17:58,580 --> 00:17:59,800
他没有
He didn't.

332
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:01,360
我也觉得他没有
I didn't think he did.

333
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:10,070
你跟他…谈过吗
Have you... talked to him?

334
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:14,790
没  那之后就没有
No, not since.

335
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:16,880
你呢
Have you?

336
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,030
谈过  在他们把我带去问话之后
Yeah, I mean, after they brought me in.

337
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:21,220
我们谈过
Yeah.

338
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:23,800
他怎么样了
How is he?

339
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,660
变了  又没变
Different, same.

340
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:29,260
他很久以来日子都不好过
I mean, he's lived rough for a long time now.

341
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:33,320
他好像一直是这样
He always did, it seemed like.

342
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,640
这事对他影响很大
Taken a toll.

343
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:39,770
他需要我的帮助
He needs my help.

344
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,760
你会帮他吗
Are you gonna help him?

345
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,800
会
Yes.

346
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:49,960
为什么
Why?

347
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,980
我必须帮
I have to.

348
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:56,150
是怎么回事  警察觉得他干了什么
Well, what is it? What do the police think he did?

349
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:58,910
我不能说  这是私家侦探的规定
I can't talk about that. It's PI stuff.

350
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:02,120
他雇了我的事务所  我雇了他
He's hiring the firm, I'm hiring him.

351
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:04,860
一直以来  你们俩
All this time, you two,

352
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:07,480
就这样而已了吗
and just-- just like that?

353
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:12,000
我被他说服了
Oh, I took some convincing.

354
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,680
我看着比利的眼睛
I looked in Billy's eyes.

355
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:20,460
{\an8}黄袍国王  卡寇莎

356
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,940
他也看着我的眼睛
He looked in mine.

357
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:21,430
他停了我的职
He got me suspended.

358
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:27,030
比利·李·塔特尔现在在路易斯安那州有三栋房子
Now, Billy Lee Tuttle owns 3 houses in Louisiana.

359
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:29,360
一栋在薛夫波特  一栋在巴吞鲁日
One in Shreveport, one in Baton Rouge,

360
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,010
还有一栋在新奥尔良
one in New Orleans.

361
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:32,910
弗罗里达州还有一栋
Also one in Florida.

362
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:37,270
我一直等到他们部门去春游  10年...
I waited till he went on his spring ministry tour, 2010--

363
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:39,630
听着  拉斯特  我改主意了
Look, Rust, I changed my mind.

364
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:42,750
我不想听你都干了什么
If you did something, I don't want to hear about it.

365
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:45,340
还记得我说过我抢劫的事吗
Remember I told you about my stint in robbery?

366
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:48,280
我可是撬锁溜门的好手
I make a pretty ace B&E man.

367
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:53,010
我观察了他的房子好几周
Now, I staked his places out for weeks.

368
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:55,730
弄清摄像头位置和保安的巡逻规律
Checked surveillance, map security.

369
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:57,140
我找到了切入口
I found ingresses.

370
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:58,290
你再看我
Now, here I am, you know.

371
00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:01,940
我的人生就是不断扩大的一塌糊涂
My whole life is just one expanding, circular fuck-up

372
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:03,270
我觉得犯下非法入室罪
and I think it's about to close out

373
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:05,780
日子也就到头了
with me getting clipped in a home invasion.

374
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:07,220
我是说
I mean, what I'm saying is

375
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:10,920
我知道自己可能疯了
I was aware that I might have lost my mind.

376
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:25,110
但搜完他第二处住宅后
But after the second home...

377
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:29,400
这种疑虑消失了
doubt got taken behind the woodshed and put down.

378
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,720
因为他并没有报案说巴吞鲁日的房子被盗
Notice he never reported the Baton Rouge break-in,

379
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,380
只说了薛夫波特的房子
just the Shreveport house.

380
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:41,030
在那里的保险箱里找到了那些
Found those in the safe there.

381
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:44,480
那些纸已经保存了15年以上了
Paper stock's over 15 years old.

382
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,360
见鬼
Goddamn it.

383
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:49,120
还有这些  要是不搞清楚
These... they aren't as bad

384
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,970
你根本意识不到他们的邪恶
if you don't know what you're looking at.

385
00:20:56,770 --> 00:20:58,280
他妈的
Motherfuck.

386
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,190
还有
And...

387
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,310
有一卷录像带
there's a videotape.

388
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:28,690
看看吧
Take a look.

389
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:43,280
不
No!

390
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:45,830
天哪
God!

391
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:48,590
上帝啊
Jesus!

392
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:53,100
操
Fuck!

393
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:00,430
操
Fuck!

394
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:04,680
你全看完了
You watch all of that?

395
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:07,010
是
Yeah.

396
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:11,400
我得看有没有人摘下过面具
Yeah, I had to, see if any of the men took off their mask.

397
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:12,860
没人摘过
None did.

398
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,840
操
Oh, fuck.

399
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:18,640
我不会移开视线
I won't avert my eyes.

400
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,250
这次不会
Not again.

401
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:24,150
天哪
Jesus Christ.

402
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:30,220
那个小姑娘是玛丽·方特诺特
That little girl is Marie Fontenot.

403
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:36,010
是你杀了塔特尔吗
Did you kill Tuttle?

404
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:37,700
不是
No.

405
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:39,300
我猜
I assume that

406
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:42,180
他觉得自己会被勒索
he was thinking he was gonna be blackmailed.

407
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:45,810
而有人发现发现  在他来得及转移前
And I think some people took him out after they found out

408
00:23:45,810 --> 00:23:48,880
保险箱里东西不见了  就杀了他
what was taken from the safe, before he had a chance to.

409
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:54,170
我该怎么帮你
What...can I do to help?

410
00:23:56,430 --> 00:24:00,580
我们从所有跟朵拉·兰有关的东西开始查
We start by pulling everything there is on Dora Lange.

411
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:02,240
我弄了一个名单
And I got names,

412
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,640
名单上是她家人以及塔特尔的教友
I got family members, Tuttle connections.

413
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,540
我们还需要所有跟
Any information that we can get

414
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:10,510
雷吉或者德沃尔·勒杜有关的信息
on Reggie or Dewall Ledoux.

415
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:13,180
我们可以在你公司外面碰头
All right, we can coordinate out of your offices

416
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:14,860
如果你乐意
if you want.

417
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,870
你无权保管那个
You shouldn't have that.

418
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:30,080
没人有权保管
Nobody should have this.

419
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:42,660
你一切都好我跟高兴  玛姬
I'm glad that you're doing good, Maggie.

420
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:45,430
好像所有人都很幸福
It seems like everybody's happy, you know.

421
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:49,290
挺  咳  挺好的
It's...ahem. It's good to see.

422
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:51,650
谢谢
Thank you

423
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,330
你做的一切
for everything.

424
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:59,210
我两年多没见过你了  小马
I haven't seen you in over two years, Marty.

425
00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:04,390
你是来说再见的吗
Did you come here to say good-bye?

426
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,820
谢谢你  玛姬
Thank you, Maggie.

427
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:11,650
真心的
I mean that.

428
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:39,980
{\an8}哈特调查中心

429
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:40,930
不会有太多人
There's not gonna be a bunch of people

430
00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:43,260
进出这里  对吧
coming in and out of this place, is there?

431
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:46,050
你觉得呢  拉斯特
What do you think, Rust?

432
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:52,980
实际上我们要做的就是确认身份和定位
Practical terms, we're doing an identify and locate.

433
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:55,360
我现在已经订不起
Now, I can't afford to subscribe to all

434
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,720
以前用的那些数据库了
the databases that I used to,

435
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:00,490
不过我还有能查机动车记录的
but I got Auto Track XP

436
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:02,790
XP版自动追踪
for motor vehicle records.

437
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:04,520
我还有QI国家人口检索的
I got Flat Rate Info

438
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:08,380
所有平价信息
for the QI National People Locator,

439
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:10,480
当然都是公开的信息
public records, of course.

440
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:11,670
好吧
All right.

441
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:13,100
听起来不错
That sounds good.

442
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,320
你这些年过得怎么样
How you been? Ahem.

443
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,330
除了工作之外
You know, besides work,

444
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:24,690
你都做些什么
what do you do?

445
00:26:26,930 --> 00:26:29,890
不好意思  你以前好像从来没有
I'm sorry, I just-- I don't ever remember you asking me

446
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:31,970
问过我私人问题
a personal question before.

447
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,050
你也知道的
Uh...you know,

448
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:37,910
就是让自己一直有点事做
I just stay busy, uh,

449
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:40,880
钓钓鱼  交交女朋友
fish, girlfriends.

450
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:42,470
你现在有交往对象吗
You seeing anybody?

451
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:46,620
不算吧  就约会过几次
Not really. Some dates.

452
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:49,210
都比较随意
You know, it's all pretty casual.

453
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:53,350
不过我确实有过一段比较久的关系
I did have something going for a while,

454
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:56,990
跟一个菲律宾女孩儿  虽然没有结果
this Filipino girl, but that didn't pan out.

455
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:05,420
生活平静  不在外面鬼混  每天回家
Quiet life. I don't stay out late. I just--I go home.

456
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:21,220
你呢
You?

457
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:23,090
我跟你差不多
Ah, I'm about the same.

458
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:24,880
没有女朋友
No girlfriend.

459
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,350
就是上班下班
Just go to work, go home.

460
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:52,160
那个02年时跟你交往的女孩怎么样了
How about that girl you were seeing in '02?

461
00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:53,190
跟她发展得怎么样
What ever happened with her?

462
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:56,580
没交往太长时间
Yeah, that was never gonna last.

463
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:58,410
就不应该开始
Never should have started.

464
00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:01,300
没错  老天
Yeah. Boy.

465
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:03,830
她  有点问题
She, uh, she had problems.

466
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,020
你不就喜欢疯狂的女人嘛
Oh, you always liked them crazy.

467
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:08,560
对  我确实喜欢
Yeah, that I did.

468
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,680
你为什么辞职  小马
Why'd you quit, Marty?

469
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:15,130
不辞的话你肯定早升官了
Yeah, you could have been boss, you know.

470
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:18,310
至少是警督  或是警监
LT, at least, Captain.

471
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:22,320
在你离开后我又干了四年  然后我
I did another 4 years after you left, and I--

472
00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:26,080
可能这工作对我来说太顺其自然了
I guess the job just kind of ran its course with me.

473
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,410
怎么说
How is that?

474
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:31,990
我以前还想去打棒球  去骑公牛
I was gonna play baseball, ride bulls.

475
00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:33,730
结果就干上了一份
You know, you end up becoming

476
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:35,880
从未想过的职业
something you never intended.

477
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:40,800
我猜根本没人能弄明白原因
Uh, I guess you never really even know why.

478
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:46,270
我说不定还能成为画家
I suppose I could have been a painter,

479
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:48,060
专画历史事件的
you know, a historian.

480
00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:50,730
旧场景  新细节
Old scenes, new details.

481
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:54,170
是啊  你经常画画吗
Yeah, yeah. You do much painting?

482
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:55,370
不画
Nah.

483
00:28:55,370 --> 00:28:58,440
我猜现在再开始已经太晚了
Little late in the game to start something like that, I reckon.

484
00:28:58,790 --> 00:29:01,720
这一辈子连做好一件事都来不及
Life's barely long enough to get good at one thing.

485
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,150
如果活得够长
If that long.

486
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:07,250
是啊  所以得认真选择要做好的事
Yeah, so be careful what you get good at.

487
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:13,190
{\an8}失踪的孩子

488
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:16,010
对开飞机的黑人该叫什么
What do you call a black man who flies a plane?

489
00:29:16,010 --> 00:29:17,220
我不知道
I don't know.

490
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:19,400
飞行员  你这个种族歧视的混蛋
Pilot, you racist bastard.

491
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,300
你还想怎么叫他
What else would you call him?

492
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,310
说到这  我上了几门写作课
Well, speaking of, you know, I been taking some writing courses?

493
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:29,070
说真的
And, uh--no.

494
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:32,040
我上过  一直时不时地
I have, and I been tinkering around

495
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:34,560
在修改这份稿子
with this thing off and on.

496
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,050
真实案件
True crime.

497
00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:38,500
那只是体裁  不是标题
And that's the genre, not the title.

498
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,150
-你是认真的  -当然
- You serious? - Yeah.

499
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:43,700
关于95年还有其他旧案子的
You know, what happened in '95 and some other old cases,

500
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:46,570
而我需要帮忙  博比
and all I need from you, Bobby,

501
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:50,140
给我一些以前案件的资料
is some old copies of case files.

502
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:54,990
你还爱喝单一麦芽威士忌  对吧
You still like your single malt, don't you?

503
00:29:57,610 --> 00:29:59,700
对  没错
Ah, I guess I do.

504
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:03,440
生意现在这么难做吗
Oh, business gotten so bad

505
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,900
你都被逼当作家了
you got to become a writer?

506
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:06,930
不  我一直想写书来着
Nope, I've always wanted to do it.

507
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:08,330
只是以前太忙了
I just never had the time.

508
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:11,930
说到资料  我可不想碰到傻逼和挫逼
And regards the files, I'd like to avoid Fuck and Suck,

509
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:14,360
就上周六我碰到的那两人
the two dicks I spent last Saturday with.

510
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,410
帕帕尼亚和吉尔包

00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:21,510
没问题  伙计  如你所愿
'Course, man. Whatever you need.

513
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:24,990
谢谢你  博比
Appreciate it, Bobby.

514
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:26,130
不用谢
Not a problem.

515
00:30:28,050 --> 00:30:29,810
很可能是失踪人口
Missing persons, mostly.

516
00:30:29,810 --> 00:30:31,800
也许早在八十年代
Maybe far back as the eighties.

517
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:34,140
在05年之前的案子卷宗
Well, anything before '05 that never

518
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:36,640
从不会被官方调查
became part of an official investigation,

519
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:39,060
肯定不会录入计算机中的
it isn't gonna be in the computers.

520
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:40,680
你得翻文件了
You're gonna have to sort through the files.

521
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:53,070
谢谢
Thank you.

522
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:25,500
找到了点背景线索
Found something, background.

523
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,480
德沃尔·勒杜把一辆卡车的所有权

524
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,130
转给一个叫吉米·勒杜的人了

525

我在白色城堡找到了他

528
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:38,160
好吧
All right.

00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:41,040
你找到玛丽·方特诺特的案宗了吗
Did you pull that Marie Fontenot file?

530
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:43,780
没有
There wasn't one.

531
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,900
文件不见了  正在顺线索调查
Report's gone. Backtracking that.

532
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,390
小马  这位是罗伯特·杜曼

这家店是他的

534
00:31:58,700 --> 00:31:59,790
生意怎么样

00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:01,020
位置不错
Nice spot.

536
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:05,180
他不是警察了  罗伯特
He's not a cop no more, Robert.

537
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:08,090
你有什么讨厌警察的原因吗

545
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:35,630
姓勒杜的人这么多  找点联系实在不难
So many Ledouxs around, I never had to worry about a connection.

But, yeah, my dad's second cousin or something.

我爸对他们一点都不感冒

他说他们还没白到可以自称白废物
Said they weren't white enough to be white trash.

549
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:46,290
这到底是什么事

550

有人让我们找到他女儿

是很久以前的事了

很抱歉听到这个消息

必须搞清楚他们发生了什么事

555

那帮臭傻逼
Sick shits.

00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,190
爸爸说他们死的太早了
Pop said they died too quick.

557
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:01,730
你知不知道什么关于这些人的事
Is there anything you

558
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:04,190
可以告诉我们的
remember that you can tell us about these guys?

559
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:06,940
他们就是疯子  看人的眼神都透着疯狂
Just they were nuts. Looked at you funky.

560
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:10,700
雷金经常问起我学校里的女孩子

有几次我见到德沃尔的时候

562
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,920
他都满嘴胡话
he just said kooky stuff.

563
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,420
你有没有看见过
Any chance you ever saw a third man with them,

564
00:33:19,050 --> 00:33:20,770
一个脸下方有大量伤疤的人
a man who had a bunch of scars

565
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,910
和他们在一起
on the bottom of his face?

566
00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:29,230
你这么一说确实
It's weird you say that.

567
00:33:30,690 --> 00:33:31,760
我记得那张脸
I remember that face.

568
00:33:34,010 --> 00:33:36,070
我爸爸有次让他们用我们的猎鹿营地
My pop let them use our deer camp once.

569
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:38,800
也带我一起去了  我那时大概11岁
Took me with him. I was, like, 11.

570
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,330
他们比我大十岁左右
They were maybe 10 years older than me.

571
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,280
他们把我介绍给了那个人
They introduced us to the guy.

572
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:45,970
他的脸上  鼻子和脸颊下面
His face, underneath his nose and cheeks,

573
00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:47,050
布满了伤疤
scarred.

574
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:50,140
整晚都在做奇怪的表情
Gave me funny looks all night.

575
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:53,310
每次我瞥到他  他都在盯着我
Every time I glanced at him, staring at me.

576
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:58,470
有没有可能这个人也勒杜家的
Any chance this man with the scars was another Ledoux?

577
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:01,900
不  我不知道  我觉得不是
No. I don't know. I don't think so.

578
00:34:03,410 --> 00:34:05,400
第二天早上  他们宿醉未醒没法打猎
Next morning, men were too hung-over to hunt.

579
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,710
我和爸爸回了家
Pop and I went home.

580
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:10,970
你之后还有见过那个有伤疤的人吗
You, uh, ever see him again, guy with the scars?

581
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:13,510
再也没有
Never again.

582
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:15,480
见过我会记得的
I'd remember.

583
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:32,450
操  我不喜欢这个地方
Fuck, I don't like this place.

584
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:36,040
所有东西生长的方向都不对
Nothing grows in the right direction.

585
00:34:38,730 --> 00:34:40,260
这个女人是怎么查到的
Where'd this woman come from?

586
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:43,430
税务记录
Tax records.

587
00:34:43,610 --> 00:34:46,470
从塔特尔的爸爸那儿领取薪水
Drew a paycheck from Tuttle's father.

588
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:49,220
佣人那类的性质
Uh, some kind of domestic.

589
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:53,090
你怎么找到她的
How'd you find her?

590
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:58,440
我找到了40年到59年间的联邦所得税记录
Well, had to get federal income tax records from '40 to '59.

591
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:02,460
发现社保号和90年代末
I matched Social with a credit check run

592
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:03,930
一次信用核查相匹配
in the late nineties

593
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:06,740
当时是为了在亚历山大第八区租房
for Section-8 housing in Alexandria.

594
00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:09,260
做得好
Good job.

595
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,840
看看你
Look at you. Heh!

596
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:14,240
一个酒保给了我好高的赞扬
High praise from a bartender.

597
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:22,190
条子
Cops.

598
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:31,690
她很容易累
She gets tired easy,

599
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:33,900
特别是像现在这么热
'specially hot as it is.

600
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:36,050
我不知道你们要干什么
Now, I don't understand what this is about.

601
00:35:36,270 --> 00:35:37,000
谢谢
Thank you.

602
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:41,570
我们是私家侦探  受人雇佣前来
We're private investigators, hired to do, uh,

603
00:35:41,570 --> 00:35:43,330
调查祖上的信息
ancestral research.

604
00:35:43,330 --> 00:35:45,790
沿海的矿权问题
M-mineral rights along the coast.

605
00:35:47,990 --> 00:35:50,670
我从来没见过塔特尔家的人  但我听过传言
I never knew them Tuttle people, but I heard stories.

606
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:51,800
算了吧  谢谢
No, thank you.

607
00:35:53,350 --> 00:35:55,290
你觉得她可能从中赚到点钱吗
You think she might get some money out this?

608
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,390
很有可能
Uh, quite possible.

609
00:35:57,390 --> 00:35:59,490
取决于我们能查出些什么
Depends on what we find out.

610
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:04,530
德洛丽丝女士
Miss Delores?

611
00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:10,470
你给山姆·塔特尔先生工作了19年  对吗
You worked for Mr. Sam Tuttle 19 years, right?

612
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:11,550
是的
Yes.

613
00:36:11,810 --> 00:36:13,010
在伊拉斯
Erath.

614
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:17,250
然后是薛夫波特
Then Shreveport.

615
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:20,820
那你认识他的儿子  比利·李  对吗
So you knew his son, Billy Lee, right?

616
00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:22,920
他的堂兄  埃迪
A cousin, Eddie?

617
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:26,150
小男孩们  我记得
Little boys, mm-hmm. I remember.

618
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:28,040
远亲呢
What about extended family?

619
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:31,460
有没有堂兄之类的  跟男孩们比较熟的
Cousins, you know, that might have been close to the boys?

620
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:34,430
那时候的家族比现在庞大的多
Those days, families were bigger.

621
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:39,820
哥哥弟弟表亲堂亲  孩子们到处乱跑
Oh, all sorts of brothers, cousins, kids just running around.

622
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:42,030
山姆·塔特尔
Did, uh, Sam Tuttle have

623
00:36:42,130 --> 00:36:44,520
有没有什么私生子
kids outside his marriage that you know about?

624
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:46,750
你该知道的
Hmm! Don't you know it.

625
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:52,260
现如今  人们独享自己的东西
Now, people kept their own back then.

626
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:56,430
男人的房子就是他自己的
I mean, a man's house was his own.

627
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,210
山姆先生呢
Mr. Sam?

628
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:01,240
他有很多孩子
He had lots of children.

629
00:37:01,370 --> 00:37:02,720
性格迥异
All types.

630
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:06,210
他没对任何女人动过心
He didn't like a woman--

631
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:13,020
一旦女人和他发生了关系
See, once she had it done to her,

632
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,970
春宵一刻后  他就拔屌无情
he didn't like them but that one time.

633
00:37:16,810 --> 00:37:18,100
绝不动心
Not after that.

634
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:21,700
在所有这些东奔西跑的孩子们中
Hmm, and out of all these kids running around,

635
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,530
有没有个孩子
you remember one that maybe had scars

636
00:37:25,530 --> 00:37:27,740
脸下边可能有道疤
all across the bottom of his face?

637
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:32,550
那是山姆先生的孙子吧
I--I think that was Mr. Sam's grandchild.

638
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,610
那是他爸爸弄的  可怜的孩子
His daddy did that to him, that poor boy.

639
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:40,450
我觉得那孩子是柴尔德里斯家的人
I -- I think that child was a -- a Childress

640
00:37:40,450 --> 00:37:43,230
菲  他是勒布家的还是柴尔德里斯家的
or what, Fi, he was a LeBeau or a Childress?

641
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:45,150
山姆先生其他家人的孩子吗
From Mr. Sam's other family?

642
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:50,610
我不该和你说这个的
I shouldn't be talking to you about this.

643
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,000
没关系的
That's OK.

644
00:37:54,950 --> 00:37:56,060
徳洛丽斯小姐
Miss Delores.

645
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:59,890
能帮我确认件事吗  一件事
Could you have a look at something for me? One thing.

646
00:37:59,890 --> 00:38:01,850
一眼就行  看您能不能认出来
Just have a look. See if you recognize it.

647
00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:14,050
你知道卡寇莎
You know Carcosa?

648
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,030
那是什么
What is it?

649
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:24,980
他会吞噬时间
Him who eats time.

650
00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:29,750
他的长袍
Him robes...

651
00:38:30,930 --> 00:38:34,050
像一阵风  只闻其声不见其人
it's a wind of invisible voices.

652
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:37,310
什么矿权  你们到底在干嘛
Mineral rights, my ass. What you all doing?

653
00:38:37,310 --> 00:38:38,400
庆祝
Rejoice.

654
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:40,950
死亡不是尽头
Death is not the end.

655
00:38:40,950 --> 00:38:42,840
-庆祝  -你们得离开了  立刻
- Rejoice. - You need to leave, now.

656
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:46,190
-死亡不是尽头  -你们得离开了
- Death is not the end. - You need to leave.

657
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:48,140
你知道卡寇莎
You know Carcosa?

658
00:38:49,470 --> 00:38:50,750
庆祝
You rejoice.

659
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:51,910
卡寇莎
Carcosa.

660
00:39:21,310 --> 00:39:23,710
家里其余的人都不太和徳洛丽斯阿姨说话
Rest of the family, they don't really talk to Aunt D.

661
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:25,490
她疯了
She crazy.

662
00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:27,340
痴呆
Dementia.

663
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:29,690
她从没过过好日子
She never had any kind of good life,

664
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,770
大部分时候  她都意识混乱
but most days, she can't even make sense.

665
00:39:31,770 --> 00:39:33,790
是吗  我觉得她的意思很清楚
Yeah? She sure made sense to me.

666
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:36,520
那你值得担忧了  先生
That should worry you, mister.

667
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,830
真希望那个老太太是错的
Sure hope that old lady was wrong.

668
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:51,660
关于什么
About what?

669
00:39:51,730 --> 00:39:53,980
死亡并不是尽头
About death not being the end of it.

670
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:05,940
我又调查了下玛丽·方特诺特
Did some backtracking on the Marie Fontenot stuff.

671
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:07,370
找到了几份以前的文件
Got some old sheets.

672
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:10,620
治安官签了"错报"
Sheriff signed off on the "Report made in error,"

673
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,850
但他并没有投诉她
but he didn't take the original complaint on her.

674
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:15,480
代理治安官投诉得
Deputy did.

675
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:18,100
你知道是谁吗
Got a name?

676
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:21,570
你肯定无法相信
You ain't gonna believe this shit.

677
00:40:22,370 --> 00:40:23,850
史蒂夫·杰瑞西
Steve Geraci.

678
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:26,370
所以我复核了一次
So I did some double-checking.

679
00:40:26,370 --> 00:40:27,870
当刑事调查员以前
Before CID,

680
00:40:27,870 --> 00:40:30,310
他在梵米伦教区当治安官
he was with Vermillion Parish Sheriff's.

681
00:40:30,650 --> 00:40:32,240
伊拉斯是他的辖区
Erath was his beat.

682
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,500
既然有人盖住了这件事
If it got covered up,

683
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:35,930
那史蒂夫可能知道些什么
Steve might know something.

684
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:39,670
我们95年问他的时候却什么都没说
Didn't say a fucking word when we asked about it in '95.

685
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:43,160
我一直都不喜欢那个混蛋
I never did like that cocksucker.

686
00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:45,220
他现在在哪
Where is he now?

687
00:40:45,450 --> 00:40:47,780
问题就在这里
Well, uh, this is the thing.

688
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,750
他来自伊比利亚
He's from Iberia originally.

689
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:53,920
不当刑事调查员以后  他就回家了
After CID, he went home.

690
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:57,420
他现在是伊比利亚教区的治安官
He's Sheriff of Iberia Parish.

691
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:58,870
操
Shit.

692
00:40:59,120 --> 00:40:59,920
没错
Yeah.

693
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:03,470
拉斯特  在这个州
Rust, the only person can arrest the sheriff

694
00:41:03,470 --> 00:41:04,820
能逮捕治安官的人  只有州长
in this state is the governor.

695
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:07,400
我们不是要去逮捕他  小马
Well, we ain't looking to arrest him, Marty,

696
00:41:08,230 --> 00:41:09,730
只是找他谈谈话
just have a little chat.

697
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:12,180
他才不会来跟你谈话
Well, he ain't gonna talk with you.

698
00:41:12,210 --> 00:41:15,560
我车里的电池和两跟跨接电缆可不这么认为
I got a car battery and two jumper cables argue different.

699
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:17,790
你最好别有那种想法
Don't even start with that shit.

700
00:41:17,790 --> 00:41:19,570
那你有什么建议吗  小马
What do you recommend, Marty?

701
00:41:19,890 --> 00:41:21,790
操  你为什么不去跟他谈谈
Well, fuck, why don't you talk to him?

702
00:41:22,010 --> 00:41:23,640
你们俩不是一直看对方很对眼
You two always liked each other.

703
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:26,610
我只是比较会交际
Well, what can I say? I'm a people person.

704
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:28,640
那就跟他交际交际
Well, start with that, then.

705
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:35,560
拜托
Oh, come on.

706
00:41:36,450 --> 00:41:38,330
放松一点  慢慢来
Just try to relax. Take your time.

707
00:41:42,330 --> 00:41:43,160
进了
There you go.

708
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,140
好球
OK. Nice shot.

709
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:47,790
这距果岭有15码吗
What was that, 15 on the green?

710
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:49,860
我不知道
Ha ha ha! I don't know.

711
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:55,800
之前在电话里
Hey, you know, on the phone,

712
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:58,050
你提到过一个叫方特诺特的姑娘
you were saying something about that Fontenot girl.

713
00:41:58,540 --> 00:42:00,500
-是啊  -你怎么会注意那个
- Yeah. - Why's that on your radar?

714
00:42:01,450 --> 00:42:04,050
没什么  只是...
Oh, it's nothing. It's just, uh,

715
00:42:04,590 --> 00:42:06,880
有个她的远房亲戚想知道她在哪儿
extended family wants a locate.

716
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:10,010
我当时没去记
I didn't remember at the time.

717
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:11,620
95年的时候
Back in '95,

718
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:14,030
我酗酒酗得很厉害
I was hitting the bottle a lot back then.

719
00:42:14,170 --> 00:42:15,460
谁不是呢
Yeah, who wasn't?

720
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:18,070
已经20年了
20 years ago, you know.

721
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:21,680
我印象中
My recall,

722
00:42:22,410 --> 00:42:23,910
孩子他妈还是单身
girl's mom was single,

723
00:42:24,850 --> 00:42:26,000
被控吸毒
drug charges.

724
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:35,710
小女孩跑去跟生父一起过
Little girl went to live with her birth daddy, I think.

725
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:38,050
如果我没记错的话  就是这样
That is, if I'm remembering right.

726
00:42:39,410 --> 00:42:41,380
第一次收到通知的时候
Uh, Mama didn't make a fuss after

727
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:44,350
妈妈没有大惊小怪  坦然接受了
the first notice, so she was fine with it.

728
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:51,840
你有直接和那家人谈过吗
And you talked to the family directly back then?

729
00:42:51,850 --> 00:42:53,580
没有  泰德·柴尔德里斯去的
No. Ted Childress,

730
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:55,720
他是治安官  他认识他们
the sheriff. He knew them.

731
00:42:57,530 --> 00:42:58,570
柴尔德里斯
Childress?

732
00:43:00,410 --> 00:43:01,540
看好了
Now watch this.

733
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:07,740
喜欢吗
You like that?

734
00:43:08,690 --> 00:43:11,300
一个南方佬那儿缴来的  他私藏大麻
Seized it off a good old boy, had a quarter-bag of weed.

735
00:43:11,530 --> 00:43:14,680
你会爱死这国家的
Ooh. You got to love this country.

736
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:16,920
很高兴再见到你  伙计
Good to see you again, man.

737
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:18,130
我也一样
Good to see you.

738
00:43:21,250 --> 00:43:22,160
对了
Hey, uh,

739
00:43:22,670 --> 00:43:23,870
你的那个客户
that client you got,

740
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:26,140
在打听方特诺特女孩的那个
asking about the Fontenot girl.

741
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:29,410
你转告他们  我很乐意和他们聊聊
You let them know I'll be happy to talk to them.

742
00:43:30,010 --> 00:43:32,390
是的  远房亲戚
Oh, yeah, distant relatives.

743
00:43:32,390 --> 00:43:34,850
圣路易斯的  有点遗产问题要解决而已
St. Louis. Trying to settle a tiny inheritance.

744
00:43:34,850 --> 00:43:36,100
没什么大不了的
Don't worry about it.

745
00:43:37,830 --> 00:43:38,740
好的
Ok.

746
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:41,790
他们想谈谈的话  就告诉他们
Well, they want to talk, you let them know.

747
00:43:42,450 --> 00:43:45,320
没问题  慢点开  治安官
Yeah. Don't go too fast, Sheriff.

748
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:46,320
那当然
Not me.

749
00:43:47,290 --> 00:43:48,420
啥时候再一起玩
Let's do it again some time.

750
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:49,770
好啊  非常乐意
Yeah, I like that.

751
00:44:03,110 --> 00:44:05,090
还是把跨接电缆准备好吧
Better get those jumper cables ready.

752
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:07,360
那狗娘养的在说谎
The motherfucker's lying.

753
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:52,870
拉斯特
Rust.

754
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:56,230
很高兴见到你
It's good to see you.

755
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:57,360
扯淡
Bullshit.

756
00:45:05,030 --> 00:45:06,200
我和小马谈过了
I talked to Marty.

757
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:09,200
我听说你也和警察谈过了
I hear you talked to the cops, too.

758
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:11,220
的确还有他们
Yes, them, too.

759
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:13,450
你好吗
How are you?

760
00:45:14,450 --> 00:45:15,700
小马和你说了什么
What'd Marty tell you?

761
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:18,870
他想知道  警察问了我什么
He wanted to know what the police asked me about.

762
00:45:18,870 --> 00:45:21,670
他说他在帮你事  就这么多
He said he was helping you with something. That's it.

763
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:25,560
你回来多久了
How long you been back?

764
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:27,420
听说你买了间大房子
Hear you got a big house.

765
00:45:28,090 --> 00:45:30,280
小马说  女儿们都过得挺好
Marty says the girls are doing fine.

766
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:31,960
那样很好
That's good.

767
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:34,720
拉斯特
Rust,

768
00:45:35,970 --> 00:45:38,600
告诉我  你们在做的事不会让他受到伤害
just tell me it's something that's not gonna get him hurt.

769
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:41,180
我没法给你这种保证
Well, I can't tell you that.

770
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:47,170
安全从来和我无缘
It never sat right with me,

771
00:45:47,170 --> 00:45:50,550
现在也是一样  你这是在叫我说谎
and it doesn't now, you asking me to lie to you about him.

772
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:54,660
现在  快出去吧
Now, get on out of here.

773
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:56,200
这种破地方配不上你
You're classing the place up.

774
00:46:04,750 --> 00:46:06,330
你为什么辞职  小马
Why'd you quit, Marty?

775
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:09,460
真正原因是什么  发生了什么
What's the real reason? What happened?

776
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:13,300
你不妨告诉我你回来的真正原因
You tell me why you come back, for real.

777
00:46:13,370 --> 00:46:14,660
你先说
Mmm, you first.

778
00:46:16,420 --> 00:46:17,450
你为什么辞职
Why'd you quit?

779
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:22,740
我看到些事
Well, I saw something.

780
00:46:23,790 --> 00:46:24,680
婴儿
Baby.

781
00:46:27,570 --> 00:46:32,110
一个混蛋想把孩子放进微波炉里烤干
Tweaker tried to dry the kid in a microwave.

782
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:44,530
看到他干的事  我就想
Saw that, what he'd done, and I thought...

783
00:46:47,490 --> 00:46:48,390
再也不要了
never again.

784
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:53,480
我想  我再也不想看到
I thought I--I never want to look

785
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:56,610
那幅画面了
at anything like that anymore.

786
00:47:03,050 --> 00:47:04,050
该你了
Your turn.

787
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:08,750
你回来干嘛
Why'd you, uh, why'd you come back?

788
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:15,570
就是这个
This.

789
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:18,720
在你能做其他事之前
Something I had to see to...

790
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:22,870
必须先解决某些事
Before getting on with something else.

791
00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:32,390
我的生活就是
My life's been a circle

792
00:47:32,390 --> 00:47:35,240
暴力和堕落的循环
of violence and degradation

793
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:37,140
从记事起就是如此
long as I can remember.

794
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:40,890
我要解除这个循环
I'm ready to tie it off.

795
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:45,710
船上见
See you on the boat.

796
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:02,040
那天之后我一直在想
After the other day, I was thinking,

797
00:48:02,190 --> 00:48:04,500
为什么不经常去看看史蒂夫和孩子们
"Why don't I see Steve and the boys more?"

798
00:48:06,090 --> 00:48:07,930
有一段时间没来这个营地了
Ain't been out to my camp in a while.

799
00:48:10,370 --> 00:48:12,350
你知道  如果我一年里不来这里
You know, if I don't get out here

800
00:48:13,710 --> 00:48:15,250
三四次
3, 4 times a year...

801
00:48:16,050 --> 00:48:17,580
我就要崩溃了
I'm a basket case.

802
00:48:17,750 --> 00:48:18,770
是啊是啊
I hear ya.

803
00:48:23,070 --> 00:48:25,370
我最爱有一个
I do love a reason to drink beer

804
00:48:25,370 --> 00:48:27,040
早上喝酒的正当理由了
first thing in the morning.

805
00:48:31,090 --> 00:48:32,130
我说史蒂夫
Say, Steve,

806
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:34,380
我一直想问
I been wanting to ask,

807
00:48:35,550 --> 00:48:37,540
你知道  那个方特诺特女孩
you know that Fontenot girl?

808
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:39,880
记得吗  跟他爸爸走掉的那个
Remember, going off with her daddy?

809
00:48:41,020 --> 00:48:42,640
我不太明白
I--I just wasn't clear.

810
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:45,660
你是确实知道
Was it you knew for a fact

811
00:48:45,660 --> 00:48:47,040
她跟她爸爸一起走了
that she went with her daddy,

812
00:48:47,050 --> 00:48:49,940
还是有人跟你这么说得
or somebody told you that that's what happened?

813
00:48:51,050 --> 00:48:53,450
那家人跟柴尔德里斯治安官谈过
The family talked to Sheriff Childress.

814
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:56,840
治安官认识他们
The girl's aunt and uncle,

815
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:58,340
就是女孩的姑姑和叔叔
he knew them.

816
00:49:02,450 --> 00:49:03,490
他们是什么人
Who were they?

817
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:11,600
我开始觉得  这并不是一个
Starting to think this wasn't just

818
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:14,110
老朋友的友好邀请了
a friendly invitation from an old pal, huh?

819
00:49:14,110 --> 00:49:15,770
当然是老朋友的友好邀请
It's definitely that.

820
00:49:17,110 --> 00:49:18,670
这么说吧
Well, then try this, then.

821
00:49:18,790 --> 00:49:21,000
我把能想起来的全说了
I said all I remember about the girl.

822
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:24,620
来好好享受一下  别再问了
Let's just have a good time, and don't ask again.

823
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:29,230
-我完全同意  -好吧  
- I'm with you 150% on that. - All right.

824
00:49:30,740 --> 00:49:32,360
问题是  史蒂夫
Thing is, Steve...

825
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:35,400
我不会再问你
I ain't gonna ask you.

826
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:39,310
他会
He is.

827
00:49:45,030 --> 00:49:47,480
换做是我可不会这么做  史蒂夫
No, I wouldn't if I was you, Steve.

828
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:51,390
你现在可不在你的辖区  治安官
You're out of your jurisdiction, Sheriff.

829
00:49:52,010 --> 00:49:54,930
你知道我现在是谁吗  混蛋
You realize who I am now, you assholes?

830
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:57,130
知道  不知道也不会来
Yeah, I wouldn't be here if I didn't.

831
00:49:59,350 --> 00:50:00,240
小马
Marty.

832
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:02,960
别看我  我从来都控制不了他
Don't look at me. I ain't never been able to control him.

833
00:50:03,550 --> 00:50:04,560
进来
Come on.

834
00:50:05,590 --> 00:50:06,980
等这事完了看我怎么收拾你
But you're done after this.

835
00:50:08,060 --> 00:50:10,800
我会把你丢到安哥拉  用胡桃钳撕烂你屁股
I'll have boss crackers splitting your ass in Angola.

836
00:50:10,830 --> 00:50:12,460
我们会聊到那事的
Yeah, we'll talk about that,

837
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:14,360
还有些其他事
and some other things.

838
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:15,490
进来
Come on.

839
00:50:32,410 --> 00:50:34,970
科尔说的那个教堂应该就在这儿
That church Cohle talked about's supposed to be right here.

840
00:50:35,750 --> 00:50:38,250
-我们迷路了  -我们没有迷路
- We're lost. - We're not lost.

841
00:50:38,250 --> 00:50:40,470
我们方向正确  在往南走
We're going in the right direction. We're heading south.

842
00:50:40,470 --> 00:50:42,160
这样能走到49号公路吗
And that's gonna head us to 49?

843
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:43,440
我们不是在找49号公路
No, we're not looking for the 49.

844
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:44,760
是在找教堂
