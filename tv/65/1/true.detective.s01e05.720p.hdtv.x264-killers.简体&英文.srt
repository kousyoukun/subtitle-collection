我和金杰认识很久了
Oh, me and Ginger go way back,

61
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:12,830
出生入死
boosted together.

62
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:16,020
你话可不多
You ain't saying much.

63
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:18,280
我想让他给你介绍情况
I figure I let my man give you the details.

64
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:20,240
我知道你现在的处境
Look. This shit I got,

65
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,580
不管你怎么弄它
you can step on it 5, 6 times.

66
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:24,130
它还是会反击
It'll still kick.

67
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:26,150
你只需要多做一点
Just means you got to cook a little more

68
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:27,770
就能有大笔利润
for a lot more profit.

69
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,500
不
Nah.

70
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:36,500
不管是毒品还是钱  我都用不上
I ain't go no use for it or your money.

71
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,320
你不会花钱吗
What, money don't spend?

72
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:44,750
我从你的双眼里可以看到你的灵魂
I can see your soul at the edges of your eyes.

73
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:47,970
而它被腐蚀了  比如酸
It's corrosive, like acid.

74
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,620
你心里有只魔鬼  小子
You got a demon, little man,

75
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,320
而且我不喜欢你的脸
and I don't like your face.

76
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:56,770
让我想要对它动动手脚
It makes me want to do things to it.

77
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:02,740
金杰  你再找我我就让迈尔斯去找你了
Ginger, you call me again, I'm setting Miles on you.

78
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:06,500
再让我看到你
I see you again,

79
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:09,160
就等着被我收拾吧
I'm putting you down.

80
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,590
你身上被阴影覆盖着  孩子
There's a shadow on you, son.

81
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,680
小马  你跟上他了吗
Marty, you got him?

82
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:43,130
你最好跟上了  我可遭了不少罪
You fucking better, the shit I've been though.

83
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:44,730
是的  我跟上他了
I do. I got him.

84
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:46,460
路上没什么车
We're on empty roads now.

85
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:49,020
所以我必须远远跟着  不然他会发现的
So I got to drop back, or he'll spot the tail.

86
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:52,120
好  那是雷吉·勒杜的制毒同伙德沃尔
OK. That's Reggie Ledoux's cook partner Dewall.

87
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,060
跟紧他  小马
Birddog him, Marty.

88
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:54,040
没问题
You got it.

89
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,670
你的位置在哪儿
What's your location?

90
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:59,270
I-10公路南段  沿着克里奥尔自然步道
Just south of I-10 along the Creole Nature Trail

91
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:00,720
朝卡尔里斯的方向
heading towards Carlyss.

92
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,150
快点  伙计
Hurry up, man.

93
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:04,130
知道了  这就来
Copy that. On my way.

94
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:20,560
后头感觉爽不爽啊  金杰
How we doing back there, Ginger?

95
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,130
操你妈  混蛋
Fuck you, motherfucker.

96
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:27,460
爽
Yeah.

97
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:32,550
你是怎么找到勒杜的
How'd you get onto Ledoux?

98
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:34,710
我以前的一个线人
One of my old CI's tipped me off

99
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:37,560
把他制毒窝点的位置透露给了我
to the location of his cook house.

100
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,940
所以我就开始干活了
So I came back on the job.

101
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:46,300
不希望别人抓住他
Didn't want anybody else to catch him, bring him in.

102
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:50,150
你们如果想让我帮忙
Look. You want my help?

103
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:52,740
就把档案剩下的部分给我看
Just show me the rest of the file.

104
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:55,540
为什么你这么想知道有什么新发现
Why are you so hot to see the new discovery file, man?

105
00:06:58,090 --> 00:06:59,450
那为什么你们
Well, why are y'all...

106
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:03,460
这么不想让我知道
so hot to not give it to me?

107
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:07,110
不是说要一起讨论吗
It's supposed to be like a consultation, right?

108
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,300
是  但是你先来
Yeah, but you go first.

109
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:13,060
你先说一遍
You take me through it,

110
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:14,880
然后我再让你看看我们掌握了什么
and I'll let you see what we got.

111
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:21,210
那你可得信守诺言
I'll hold you to that.

112
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:49,290
金杰在哪儿
Where's Ginger?

113
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:52,320
捆好了  你有什么收获
Wrapped up in a ditch. What you got?

114
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,840
我跟丢他了  调了好几次头
Well, lost him and then had to double back

115
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,360
才找到出口
a few times till I found the exit.

116
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:58,810
他的卡车在那儿
That's his truck there.

117
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:01,810
我们得呼叫总部  拉斯特
We're gonna have to call this in, Rust.

118
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:04,460
你不会想那么做的
Eh, we don't want to do that.

119
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,960
大部队一来  把这片林子一包围
Troops will come, flood these woods.

120
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,130
他们就会四散逃开的
They could scatter.

121
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:13,780
好吧  那我们在这里也找不到他
All right. We ain't gonna find him from here.

122
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:21,760
你打过猎吗  小马
You ever been hunting, Marty?

123
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:24,750
打过
Uh, yeah--

124
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:29,200
前年隔着五十码打过十叉雄鹿
10-point buck year before last, 50 yards.

125
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,130
我说的不是埋伏在树屋里
I'm not talking about sitting in a treehouse

126
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:34,570
等着一头雄鹿
waiting to ambush a buck coming

127
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:36,440
前来嗅你的诱饵
to sniff your gash bait.

128
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:38,000
我说的是追踪
Talking about tracking.

129
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:39,880
天呐  你真是个怪胎
Jesus, you're a prick.

130
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:41,780
听着  我们找到地点  回到这里
Look. We find the place. We come back here.

131
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:43,130
然后呼叫总部
We call it in.

132
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:45,140
留一个人监视  行吗
One of us stays surveillance, yeah?

133
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:47,750
我看行
I can live with that.

134
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:50,600
走吧
Let's go.

135
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,890
你知道勒杜在哪里制毒
Now, you got a tip where Ledoux cooks,

136
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:56,230
而科尔从他所在的地方回来了
and Cohle came back from wherever he was.

137
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:58,540
你知道最终会到这一步的
You knew it was gonna get here, man.

138
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:01,530
就这一次  说点真的
Just the once, the way you tell it.

139
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:06,090
我会把我在休斯敦与比洛克西之间的每个靶场
I'll tell it the same way that I told the shooting board

140
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:10,090
和警察酒吧说过的故事再说一遍
and every cop bar between Houston and Biloxi,

141
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:11,320
你知道为什么十七年来
and you know why the story is

142
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:14,370
我的说法都是一样的吗
always the same 17 years gone?

143
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:17,150
因为事情就是这么发生的
Because it only went down the one way.

144
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:21,950
拉斯特的爸爸教他怎么用弓箭狩猎
Now, Rust's dad taught him bowhunting.

145
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,070
你得一直追踪猎物
You know, you had to track game till you got

146
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:28,550
直到相距只有三十码
within maybe 30 yards of it.

147
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:42,050
这使我们能够辨别出嫌犯的行进路线
Now, this enabled us to discern the suspect's path

148
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:44,840
从而避过他们所安装的大量的
while sidestepping various

149
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:47,670
防入侵装置
anti-intruder devices they installed.

150
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:07,290
后面全是绊线  这片空地可能是片雷区
Tripwires back there. Clearing is probably mined.

151
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:11,140
好吧  你打算怎么办
All right. How you want to do it?

152
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:15,530
你回去叫支援来  我在这等
You go back. Call it in. I'll wait here.

153
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:20,220
-你哪儿都不会去  -是的
- You're gonna hold position? - Yep.

154
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,810
快去  小马
Do it now, Marty.

155
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:29,930
去你的
Fuck you.

156
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,210
你别想单干
You ain't doing this without me.

157
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:48,130
好吧  小心前进
All right. Stay low.

158
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:56,030
我们刚要返回
We were just about to turn back,

159
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:58,410
呼叫教区  州警的人
call in parish, state, whoever.

160
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:00,690
我们知道了确切的位置
I mean, we had the location.

161
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:04,220
我们在那地方认出了嫌犯
We had our suspects identified at the location, you know?

162
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:06,520
干脆把这桩破事
Might as well just leave the shit be

163
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,860
移交给特别小组吧
and hand it off.

164
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:10,750
可事情并非如此
That ain't what happened.

165
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:15,920
就在我们准备回去的时候
No. As soon as we started to back off, man...

166
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:16,880
砰
Blam!

167
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:19,650
子弹差点打中拉斯特的头
Bullets cut through right near Rust's head.

168
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:23,610
我们反身跑进树林里
We dove opposite ways into the high growth,

169
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:25,140
但是他们发现了我们
but they'd already spotted us,

170
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:27,720
他们有个高速武器
and they had something high-velocity.

171
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:31,850
砰  我们两人之间的树被炸毁了
Boom! Blew apart this tree between us.

172
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:33,590
开打了
I mean, it was on.

173
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:39,810
各类炮火...
Heavy shit--

174
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:42,420
就像蕨类植物一样在我们周围爆开
like ferns and whatnot bursting all around us,

175
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:43,880
树皮从树上掉落下来
bark flying off of trees.

176
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:46,140
我们身处枪林弹雨之中
I mean we were in a bucket shitstorm.

177
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:11,240
操
Shit.

178
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:08,990
州警
State police.

179
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:10,600
把手放在头上
Put your hands on your head.

180
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:13,260
快把手放在头上
Put them on your head now.

181
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:15,270
别想耍花招
Don't even think about it.

182
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,340
马上把手放在头上
Put your hands on your head right now.

183
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:20,430
紧扣手指
Intertwine your fingers.

184
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:22,260
照做
Do it.

185
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:24,180
跟着我倒退
Back up toward me.

186
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:31,760
跪下  快点
Down on your knees. Go on.

187
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,910
是时候了  不是吗
It's time, isn't it?

188
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:42,270
黑星
The black stars.

189
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:43,880
闭上你的嘴
Shut the fuck up.

190
00:14:57,610 --> 00:14:59,840
他们在我们穿过树林之前就发现我们了
They'd spotted us before we crossed the forest.

191
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:04,650
我们只能在躲在水里  等待机会
So all we could do was duck for cover, dig in,

192
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:06,490
试图靠近
try getting closer.

193
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:09,730
场面一片混乱
It was chaos.

194
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:31,790
黑星升起
The black stars rise.

195
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,670
为什么用鹿角
Why the antlers?

196
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:40,650
不许动  我操
Freeze, motherfucker.

197
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:43,470
把它放下  举起手来  州警
Put it down. Hands up. State police.

198
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:54,650
把它放下
Set it down.

199
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,930
我知道接下来会发生什么
I know what happens next.

200
00:15:57,970 --> 00:15:59,800
我在梦里见过你
I saw you in my dream.

201
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:03,980
现在你和我在卡寇莎
You're in Carcosa now with me.

202
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:05,800
他看见你了
He sees you.

203
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:09,840
小马
Marty!

204
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,290
你还会再这么做的
You'll do this again.

205
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,310
时间就像一个圆
Time is a flat circle.

206
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:27,270
听着  尼采  闭上你的嘴
Listen, Nietzsche. Shut the fuck up.

207
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:28,370
把它放下
Put it down.

208
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:30,220
小马
Marty!

209
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:32,640
好的
There you go.

210
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:34,450
黑星
Black star.

211
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,840
双手抱头
Put your hands on your head.

212
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:11,410
当我躲在一辆破车后面的时候
While I was hunkered down behind this old, decrepit boat,

213
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:13,520
美国队长小马·哈特
Captain America Marty Hart

214
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,530
决定要跑到树林深处去
decides he's gonna run deep into the woods,

215
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:16,940
从侧面绕到房子后面
flank around the back of the house

216
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:19,150
勒杜向我们射击之处  对吧
where Ledoux is firing at us, right?

217
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:21,230
他悄悄绕到勒杜身后
Well, he sneaks up behind Ledoux

218
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:25,560
就当勒杜转头的时候  嘭  一枪
and just as Ledoux turns, bam, popped one off in him--

219
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:28,050
爆头  干净利落  瞬间倒毙
head shot, clean-- dropped him.

220
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:31,540
他的好哥们德沃尔  撒腿就跑
Now, his buddy Dewall, he made a run for it,

221
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,330
然后他的自制安全系统
and his homemade, cracker-ass security system

222
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:37,110
把他也给解决了
took care of the rest.

223
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:42,670
操你妈的
Oh, fuck.

224
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,980
在他的血凝固之前把他的手铐摘下来
Get the cuffs off him before his blood settles.

225
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:48,580
我们要把这儿布置的万无一失
We got to make this look right.

226
00:17:57,050 --> 00:17:59,180
他妈的  操
Goddamn. Fuck.

227
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:25,240
我们该怎么办  拉斯特
What do we do, Rust?

228
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:26,550
去他妈的
Oh, fuck him.

229
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:28,490
很高兴你还有所坚持
Good to see you commit to something.

230
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:30,070
现在快去看看孩子们
Now go see to the kids.

231
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:32,300
我没说话就不要把他们带出来
Don't bring them out until I say so.

232
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:47,150
在我们确认他俩均已死亡
After we confirmed two deaths

233
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:49,890
并搜查了房子的其余部分之后
and searched the rest of the premises,

234
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,060
我们找到了那两个孩子
that's when we found the two children.

235
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:55,530
我们非常走运
I mean, we got very lucky.

236
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:58,950
我们很有可能会被
We just as easily could've been chewed to pieces

237
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:02,570
自动步枪打成碎片
by an AK on approach.

238
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,950
我可以说这次经历让我
I can say that I walked away from the experience

239
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:23,650
对人类神圣的生命
with a greater respect for

240
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:25,730
产生了极大的敬意
the sanctity of human life.

241
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:26,630
就是这样
Yeah.

242
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:28,790
谢谢  警探
Thank you, detective.

243
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:29,940
我谨代表委员会
I believe I speak for the board

244
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:31,210
对您和哈特警探所做的
when I commend you on the heroism

245
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:33,860
英雄行为提出赞扬
displayed by you and Detective Hart.

246
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:38,400
不用  我们只是在做本职工作  先生
No. We were doing our jobs, sir.

247
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:52,250
他们和朵拉·兰一样
There were the twig sculptures

248
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:58,240
均是身戴树枝王冠  手上残留迷幻剂
and the LSD on hand matched that in Dora Lange.

249
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:04,900
每个人都很满意我们抓到了罪魁祸首
Everybody was pretty satisfied that we got our man.

250
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:16,420
男孩从一月起就失踪了
The boy had been missing since January.

251
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:19,050
他死了还不到一天
He'd been dead less than a day.

252
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:25,810
女孩甚至还没被报告失踪
The girl, she hadn't been reported yet.

253
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:28,010
她来自于圣兰德里
She was from,

254
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:30,750
当我们发现她的时候精神紧张
catatonic when we found her.

255
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,510
我为什么要沉溺于过去
Why should I live in history, huh?

256
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:43,400
操  我什么事情都不想知道了
Fuck, I don't want to know anything anymore.

257
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:46,810
这个世界充斥着解决不了的事情
This is a world where nothing is solved.

258
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:50,780
有个人曾跟我说过"时间是一个平面圆圈"
Someone once told me, "Time is a flat circle."

259
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:56,710
所有我们已经做过或是即将要做的事情
Everything we've ever done or will do

260
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:57,280
我们都会
we're gonna do

261
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,840
-一遍又一遍的做着  -干得好
- over and over and over again... - Good job, y'all.

262
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:02,790
那两个小男孩和小女孩
and that little boy and that little girl,

263
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:05,070
他们会又一次在那个房间里
they're gonna be in that room again...

264
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:06,760
又一次
and again...

265
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:12,910
又一次
and again...

266
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,150
无限循环
forever.

267
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:19,210
科尔  你就不能中枪吗
Cohle, you couldn't manage to get shot?

268
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:20,510
下一次吧
Next time.

269
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:23,180
谢谢你相信我们
Thanks for not doubting us.

270
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:23,690
一直如此
Never did.

271
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:27,840
他们来了  小马  我们的英雄
Here they come. Marty, our hero.

272
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,700
干得漂亮
Way to go, boys.

273
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:37,680
等我和明日之星喝完这杯
Little extra pouring while I finish this up

274
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:40,560
再喝点吧
with the semicelebrities?

275
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,730
如果你有心
There's plenty of news stories

276
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:44,650
会发现不少新闻故事
if you care to find them.

277
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:48,720
我升任了侦缉警长
I got promoted to detective sergeant.

278
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,300
在我的坚持下
Rust got a commendation for bravery,

279
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:53,730
拉斯特也因英勇受到嘉奖
basically because I insisted,

280
00:21:54,010 --> 00:22:00,920
那阵子一切都很好
and things were pretty good for a while, I guess.

281
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:03,840
快点  加速
Come on. Get your speed up.

282
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:10,260
没事
All right.

283
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:21,390
玛姬回来了
Maggie came around.

284
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:25,510
也许是多次的沟通  见心理医生
Just, you know, a lot of talking, counseling,

285
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:30,260
或是那次枪战让她敞开心怀
and maybe being in a shootout kind of opened her up

286
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:35,300
宽恕原谅  或者试着原谅
to forgiveness or the possibility.

287
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:37,910
滑向围墙  滑向围墙
Right to the wall. Right to the wall.

288
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:39,820
好的  就是这样
Yeah. Yeah.

289
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,720
谢天谢地
Oh, thank God.

290
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:44,410
好了  去脱冰鞋
All right. Go take off your skates.

291
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:46,000
-该走了  -不要嘛
- It's time to go. - No, no.

292
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:46,970
拜托了  妈妈
Please, please, Mom?

293
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:48,270
再一圈吧  就一圈  拜托
One more time. One more time. Please.

294
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:48,930
好吧  再滑一圈
All right. One more time around,

295
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:50,280
你们就去拖鞋  好吗
you take them off, OK?

296
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,910
爸爸能回家了吗
Is Daddy coming home yet?

297
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:52,910
再来一圈
One more time around.

298
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:54,690
去吧  再滑一圈  滑一圈
Go on. One more time. One more time.

299
00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:55,660
好的
Ok.

300
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:00,450
多谢  我需要这样
Thanks. I needed that.

301
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:02,790
我想他们也需要
I think they did, too.

302
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:07,440
-还有其他人吗  -什么
- Were there others? - What?

303
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:10,240
除了她  还有别人吗
Besides her, were there others?

304
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,210
没有
No.

305
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:19,530
没有  听着
No... and listen.

306
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:21,410
那是个不同的人
That was a different person.

307
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:26,000
我迷失过  只有一会  我...
I lost it, you know, just a little. I--

308
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:30,370
我醒悟了  我恳求你
I'm back. I'm begging.

309
00:23:31,330 --> 00:23:32,460
我会不断恳求你
I keep begging.

310
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:34,790
至死恳求你的原谅
I'll go to my grave begging you.

311
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:38,270
不仅是婚外情
It's not just the affair.

312
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:42,060
你曾经是个好男人
You used to be a good man.

313
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:47,210
戒酒五周了
Cut the booze, 5 weeks now.

314
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:49,980
我加入了互助项目  遵守承诺
I'm in a program-- Promise Keepers.

315
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:02,680
你还有很长的路要走
You have a long road to climb.

316
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:06,010
是的  没错
Yes. I do.

317
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:19,860
那几年  真美好啊
A few years, good ones.

318
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:25,420
那段时间里  玛姬安排的相亲
Down the line, one of those setups

319
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:28,240
终于有一个成功了
Maggie was so intent on finally hit,

320
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:30,150
也是个医生
doctor, no less.

321
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:33,570
是的  她和拉斯特在一起了好几年
Yeah. She and Rust had a thing, few years.

322
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,840
他是个矛盾体
He's conflict-oriented.

323
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:39,000
所以每当我反驳他
So when I deny him small arguments,

324
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,530
都会让他充满能量
it builds up his energy.

325
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:48,020
是啊  你们还真是合啊
Yeah. Are you ever a match for this dude.

326
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,380
听着  你了解拉斯特的
Look. You know about Rust.

327
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,950
七年中  他比其他州警
During those 7 years, he probably pulled more assists

328
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:57,520
做出的贡献都要大
than any other detective in the state.

329
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,170
很快就有传言说
Word got around quick.

330
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:00,630
如果你想要一份供状
You want a confession,

331
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:03,590
看看州立警探科尔有没有空
see if State Detective Cohle is available.

332
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:05,950
你的审问技巧
Your interview technique.

333
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:08,960
有什么可以传授的吗
Sure there isn't some secret you can pass on?

334
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:19,630
每个人都知道他们有问题
Look. Everybody knows there's something wrong with them.

335
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:22,320
就是不知究竟是什么
They just don't know what it is.

336
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:25,040
每个人都想招供
Everybody wants confession.

337
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:27,780
每个人都想要宣泄
Everybody wants some cathartic narrative for it,

338
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:29,530
尤其是真正有罪的
the guilty especially...

339
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:33,320
话说回来  谁没有呢
Oh, but everybody is guilty.

340
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,910
有时你能感觉到幸福
You know the good years when you're in them,

341
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:54,870
有时却要等到你风烛残年后
or you just wait for them until you get ass cancer

342
00:25:55,210 --> 00:25:58,790
才发现幸福来过又离去的痕迹
and realize that the good years came and went?

343
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:03,930
有一种感觉  你们也许偶尔也会感受到
Because there's a feeling -- you might notice it sometimes --

344
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:06,310
生活正从你们的指尖
this feeling like life has

345
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:09,390
悄然流逝
slipped through your fingers...

346
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:16,230
好像连未来都已结束
like the future is behind you,

347
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:19,580
好像你从未经历过未来
like it's always been behind you.

348
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:23,970
我是不再出轨了
You know, I cleaned up,

349
00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:26,900
但是也许我自己并未改变
but maybe I didn't change,

350
00:26:27,610 --> 00:26:29,470
至少不是向好的方向改变
not the way I needed to.

351
00:26:29,530 --> 00:26:30,790
还给我
Give it back.

352
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,080
还给我
Give it back!

353
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:39,400
还记得我说的警探诅咒吗
Remember what I said about the detective's curse?

354
00:26:40,090 --> 00:26:44,140
生活的真谛明明就在我眼前
Solution to my whole life was right under my nose --

355
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:47,570
妻子  孩子
that woman, those kids --

356
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,640
可是我却只关注着无关紧要的其他事
and I was watching everything else.

357
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:04,610
背叛婚姻确实是罪
See, infidelity is one kind of sin,

358
00:27:04,610 --> 00:27:08,930
但是我的原罪是漠然
but my true failure was inattention.

359
00:27:10,090 --> 00:27:11,700
可是明白的太晚
I understand that now.

360
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:49,550
奥德丽  奥德丽
Hey, Audrey... Audrey...

361
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:56,690
那你觉得科尔的生活
So when do you think things started to,

362
00:27:57,150 --> 00:27:59,780
你怎么说的来着  再次改变
how you put it, change again

363
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,480
是什么时候呢
with Detective Cohle?

364
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:06,930
2002年初吧  不过只是他的变了
Early on, 2002, but that was his life.

365
00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:10,340
我的则很稳定  我说过的
Mine was steady, like I said.

366
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:13,280
我只是想了解
I'm just trying to understand.

367
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:15,050
你这到底是什么意思
What is it you're going for?

368
00:28:15,050 --> 00:28:17,720
你想表达什么
What's the message?

369
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:20,860
没想表达什么  我就是我
There is no message. It's just me.

370
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:21,570
只是
It's just --

371
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:22,750
只是你的
Well, what's just you --

372
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:25,260
发型啊  衣着什么的
your hair, your clothes, your --

373
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,650
比如说  瞧瞧梅茜
I mean, I look at Macie --

374
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:31,530
女人没必要都打扮成你喜欢的样子  爸
Women don't have to look like you want them to, dad.

375
00:28:31,530 --> 00:28:34,560
女人是没必要  不过我的女儿有
No. Women, but I'm talking about my teenage daughter,

376
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,770
我并不是想干涉你穿衣打扮的自由
and I'm not trying to tell you what to wear or anything.

377
00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:37,730
我只是在试着了解
I'm just trying to understand it.

378
00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:40,480
你干嘛非要了解呢
Well, who told you you had to understand?

379
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,640
再说你也不会懂的
Why would you?

380
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:56,430
听说你进拉拉队了
I hear you made cheerleader.

381
00:28:56,430 --> 00:28:57,950
是啊  一起竞争的有
Yeah. There are, like, 10 other girls

382
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,400
十几个人呢
who didn't get it.

383
00:28:59,670 --> 00:29:03,110
我都不知道8年级就可以进拉拉队了
Hmm, I didn't know they had eighth-grade cheerleaders.

384
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:06,290
还有人8年级就进足球队了呢
Same as there's football players.

385
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:28,900
跟我们讲讲他的女朋友吧
Tell us what you know about his girl.

386
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:31,970
劳瑞吧
Yeah. Laurie. Yeah.

387
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:36,420
她是什么护士长  拉非艾特中心的吧
She became chief of something, Lafayette General, I believe.

388
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:38,900
你知道他们之间是怎么回事吗
You know what happened there between them?

389
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:42,540
男女之间还能是怎么回事呢
What always happens between men and women?

390
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:43,950
现实呗
Reality.

391
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:08,270
爸
Dad --

392
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,160
跟你妈说去
Tell it to your mother.

393
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:28,450
警察在一辆停着的车里
Deputy found her

394
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:30,880
发现了她和两个男孩
parked in a car with two boys.

395
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,140
过来  站这
Come here. Get over here.

396
00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:45,540
光着身子
Yeah, in states of undress, you know...

397
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:48,580
做爱
like fucking.

398
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,390
男孩一个19一个20
Boys are 19 and 20.

399
00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:53,190
已经被拘留了
Got them in holding for the night,

400
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,420
尚未决定是否以强奸罪名起诉
haven't decided whether to press stat. Rape charges.

401
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:57,880
什么  你不能那么做
What? You can't do that.

402
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:00,860
我可以对那些兔崽子们做任何我想做的事
I can do anything I goddamn want to those boys.

403
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:02,340
你仔细想想
You think about that.

404
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:05,290
奥德丽  看着我
Audrey, look at me.

405
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:07,850
看着我
Look at me.

406
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:11,950
你在想什么呢  我的上帝
What are you thinking? God.

407
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:16,340
你他妈的怎么了
What the fuck is wrong with you, huh,

408
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:17,890
还是这又是个
or is this one of those things

409
00:31:17,890 --> 00:31:19,990
我理解不了的事
that I'll never understand,

410
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:24,300
比如  校荡妇队队长什么的
you know, being the captain of the varsity slut team?

411
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:25,560
小马
Marty!

412
00:31:27,090 --> 00:31:28,460
我操你大爷
Fuck you.

413
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:40,060
滚回你的房间去
Get in your fucking room.

414
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:47,400
妈妈  她打我的头
Mom, she hit my head.

415
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,200
上床睡觉去  这和你无关
Go to bed. This isn't about you.

416
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:53,390
奥德丽  开门
Audrey, open the door.

417
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,300
开门  奥德丽
Open the door, Audrey.

418
00:32:02,010 --> 00:32:04,010
奥德丽  只有我和你  宝贝
Audrey, it's just you and me, honey.

419
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:07,150
你得
See...

420
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:11,640
你得告诉我究竟发生什么事了
you need to tell me what's going on.

421
00:32:13,610 --> 00:32:15,430
奥德丽  开门  求求你
Audrey, open the door, please.

422
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:20,760
这么多年了
Years.

423
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:22,230
你们听说过一个叫
You ever heard of something called

424
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:24,750
M理论的东西吗  警探们
the M-brane theory, detectives?

425
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:27,640
没有  那种东西我不懂
No. That's over my head.

426
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:30,780
那个理论说的是在我们所处的这个维度中
It's like in this universe,

427
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:36,000
我们的时间线是直线向前的
we process time linearly forward...

428
00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:41,960
但在我们的时空之外
but outside of our spacetime,

429
00:32:42,570 --> 00:32:45,580
在第四维度中
from what would be a fourth-dimensional perspective,

430
00:32:46,410 --> 00:32:48,430
时间并不存在
time wouldn't exist,

431
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:54,340
从这一点来说  如果我们能到达那个维度
and from that vantage, could we attain it...

432
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:57,550
我们会看到
we'd see...

433
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:04,070
我们这个时空就像一个平面
our spacetime would look flattened,

434
00:33:04,570 --> 00:33:07,170
就像一个雕像在很多位置摆放过
like a single sculpture with matter

435
00:33:07,170 --> 00:33:11,140
而每个位置上的雕像相互叠加又组成了其自身
in a superposition of every place it ever occupied,

436
00:33:12,710 --> 00:33:16,300
我们的感官就像轨道车一样
our sentience just cycling through our lives

437
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:20,080
循环往复
like carts on a track.

438
00:33:25,890 --> 00:33:29,520
在我们这个维度之外的所有事物
See, everything outside our dimension...

439
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:32,370
那才是永恒
that's eternity,

440
00:33:33,090 --> 00:33:36,280
永恒睥睨着我们
eternity looking down on us.

441
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,680
对我们来讲
Now, to us,

442
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,850
那是个球
it's a sphere,

443
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:44,970
而对它们而言
but to them...

444
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:49,470
只是个圆
it's a circle.

445
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,330
科尔先生
Mr. Cohle?

446
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:09,850
科尔先生  2002年发生了什么
Mr. Cohle, what happened in 2002?

447
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:16,370
盖伊·伦纳德·弗朗西斯
Guy Leonard Francis.

448
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:20,360
他们说你在利文斯顿杀了两个人
They say you killed two people in Livingston.

449
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:25,560
他们说你是专抢药店的强盗
They say you're a drug store robber.

450
00:34:26,370 --> 00:34:29,600
你知道他们已经给你起了个外号吗
You know they already got a nickname for you?

451
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:35,100
南部药店持枪劫匪
Southern Fried Pharmacy Firearm Thief.

452
00:34:36,410 --> 00:34:37,520
你喜欢那个名字吗
You like that?

453
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:39,800
起的挺不赖的  有点绕口令的感觉
Got a nice ring to it, a bit of a mouthful.

454
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:42,150
告诉你吧  伙计
Fuck, telling you, man,

455
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:43,580
这些年发展起来的东西
the shit they got these days--

456
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:46,630
科技  指纹  基因
technology, fingerprints, DNA--

457
00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:47,850
如果不是个天才
you got to be a fucking genius

458
00:34:47,850 --> 00:34:49,150
那就根本躲不过那些东西
to get past that shit.

459
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:50,040
让我们面对现实吧  弗朗西斯
Let's face it, Francis.

460
00:34:50,050 --> 00:34:52,110
你不是个天才  对吗
You ain't no fucking genius, are you?

461
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:54,820
一开始你说
First, you come in and say,

462
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:57,170
我从别的地方弄到的药
"I got the drugs from somewhere else."

463
00:34:57,170 --> 00:34:58,590
然后你又说  不  我不记得了
Then you say, "No. I don't remember.

464
00:34:58,590 --> 00:35:00,740
我不记得在哪弄的毒品了
I don't remember where I got the drugs."

465
00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:03,520
你把事情搞得太复杂
You're making it too complicated.

466
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,030
你把自己陷进一个
You're creating a maze for yourself

467
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:06,140
不可能走出来的局
that you ain't never gonna get out of.

468
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:07,370
他们吃定你了
They got you.

469
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,880
你得换个方法
You just got to change your play.

470
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,890
你得说你有障碍
You got to plead impairment.

471
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,410
你懂什么意思吗
You know what that means?

472
00:35:16,930 --> 00:35:18,700
意思就是你不能
That means that you cannot be held

473
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:21,990
对你的行为负责
accountable for your actions.

474
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:25,560
我觉得不应该怪我
Well, I don't think I ought to be blamed--

475
00:35:25,570 --> 00:35:28,990
至少不该全怪我
well, entirely blamed-- for things I did

476
00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:32,320
因为我当时受到影响了
when I was under the influence of anything.

477
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,100
我也不觉得应该怪你
I don't think you should, either.

478
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:36,200
我就是这个意思
That's what I'm saying.

479
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:40,090
天使丸  可以让人疯狂
PCP. Stuff makes a man crazy.

480
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,450
有个很著名的事件
One time, famous case,

481
00:35:43,450 --> 00:35:46,460
一个磕了天使丸的家伙把自己的脸割掉了
guy, he cut off his own face on that shit.

482
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:47,350
-真有这种事  -没错
- For real? - Hell yeah.

483
00:35:47,350 --> 00:35:48,720
往里头再兑点冰毒
You mix that with meth,

484
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:51,190
要以精神失常为理由辩护就得这么来
that's an insanity defense if I ever heard one.

485
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:53,880
你能说一个没磕药
How you gonna say a man who's not on anything

486
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:56,030
但行为疯狂的人神志不清
is insane because he did something crazy

487
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:57,290
可你能说一个磕了药而行为疯狂的人
but a man who's on something

488
00:35:57,290 --> 00:36:00,030
神志清楚吗
that made him crazy is sane?

489
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:00,790
你懂我的意思没有
You know what I mean?

490
00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:02,700
-反过来也成立  -没错
- Works both ways. - Yeah, exactly.

491
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:04,630
我其实什么都不记得
I mean, I'm not even saying that I remember anything.

492
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,140
我当时神志不清
I was shit hammered.

493
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:06,870
就是这样
There we go.

494
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:08,870
你就这么去做
That's your play right there.

495
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:11,250
操蛋的失忆故事
Fuck this amnesia story.

496
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:16,260
药效不长  但是精神失常的辩护理由
That dirt don't stick, but an insanity defense,

497
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,410
这就是你的保命牌
that's your ticket.

498
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:22,590
这样你才有机会脱身
That's your way out, all right,

499
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:24,250
因为你已经清醒了
because you're sobered up now.

500
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:25,810
恢复神志了
You got your mind right.

501
00:36:26,870 --> 00:36:28,040
意识回来了
You back.

502
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:31,280
你得告诉他们
You got to show them the difference

503
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,830
在药店那个
between that madman in that pharmacy

504
00:36:33,830 --> 00:36:35,670
一人干掉他们两个的疯子
who blew them two people away

505
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,910
跟坐在这儿这个人不一样
and the man who's sitting here right now.

506
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:41,200
你得表现出惊吓和恐惧
You got to show shock,

507
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:44,290
以及悔恨
terror, and re-fucking-morse.

508
00:36:44,290 --> 00:36:47,010
我是很悔恨
I am. I do. I'm--

509
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:49,670
-我好怕  长官  -没错
- I'm scared, sir. - Oh, yeah.

510
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:52,130
你确实应该怕
You should be, right?

511
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:54,460
你跟药店的人说了啥
Yeah. What'd you say to the pharmacist?

512
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:01,000
我说  把所有东西都交出来
I said, "Give me everything."

513
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,780
然后呢  砰  砰
And then what? Boom. Boom.

514
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:06,720
把那个倒霉鬼干掉了对吧
Blew that fucker away, didn't you?

515
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:11,180
你想被原谅吗
You want forgiveness for that?

516
00:37:12,790 --> 00:37:15,030
-对  -说出来
- Yeah. - Say it.

517
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,530
-我想要  -你想要什么
- I want it. - You want what?

518
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:20,050
原谅
Forgiveness.

519
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,770
看看你都做了什么
You see what you just did?

520
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:32,520
你刚承认了双重谋杀
You just copped to a double murder.

521
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:37,010
你逃不掉了
They got you now.

522
00:37:44,210 --> 00:37:45,800
我想做个交易
I want to make a deal.

523
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:48,840
关于什么的交易
A deal about what?

524
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:51,410
我知道一些东西
I know things.

525
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:55,060
你怎么突然又知道什么了
Oh, what you know now all of a sudden?

526
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,010
我知道
I know--

527
00:37:59,390 --> 00:38:02,600
我知道你是是  还知道
I know who you are, and I know

528
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:04,610
你们在树林里找到的那个女人
about that woman y'all found out in the woods

529
00:38:04,610 --> 00:38:08,540
很早之前  有鹿角的那个
way back, the antlers.

530
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,360
这说明不了什么
That don't mean shit.

531
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:15,050
报纸上都有
That was in the newspaper.

532
00:38:15,650 --> 00:38:16,730
你知道什么
What you know?

533
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:19,490
你什么都不知道  对吧
You don't know shit, do you?

534
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:23,760
不  你们永远抓不住犯案的人
No. Y'all never caught the man that did that.

535
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:27,820
他一直逍遥法外  不断杀人
He's been out there killing.

536
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:30,430
你在放屁  小子
You're talking out your ass, boy.

537
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,990
你什么都不知道
You don't know a fucking thing.

538
00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:35,010
你只是想拖延时间  不是吗
You're just trying to buy some time, ain't you?

539
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:36,990
我见过他一次
I met him once.

540
00:38:39,090 --> 00:38:42,480
有些大人物认识他
There's big people who know about him,

541
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:43,880
大人物
big people.

542
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:45,030
交易不成立
Ah, ain't no deal

543
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:46,370
因为根本没什么大人物
because there ain't no people.

544
00:38:46,370 --> 00:38:47,440
我们做个交易
You make me a deal.

545
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,200
做个交易  你不要起诉我谋杀
You deal with me with these murders.

546
00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:49,950
交易不成立
Ain't no deal.

547
00:38:49,950 --> 00:38:50,670
你什么都不知道
You ain't got nothing

548
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:52,140
因为你就是一坨屎
because you're full of shit,

549
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:53,440
而且犯下那种谋杀案的人
and there ain't nobody alive

550
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,090
根本没有活下来
that did none of that killing.

551
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,990
他死了  小子
He's dead, boy.

552
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:02,620
我可以告诉你黄袍国王的事
I'll tell you about the Yellow King.

553
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:10,620
你说什么  小子
What the fuck you say, boy?

554
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:12,380
告诉我名字
Give me a name.

555
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,010
快他妈告诉我名字
Give me a fucking name.

556
00:39:16,010 --> 00:39:18,690
你想跟我玩吗  小子
You want to fucking play, boy?

557
00:39:18,850 --> 00:39:20,720
黄袍国王
The Yellow King!

558
00:39:22,330 --> 00:39:24,780
滚开  放开我
Get the hell off me! Get off me!

559
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:27,350
放开我
Get off of me!

560
00:39:27,350 --> 00:39:30,090
跟我做交易  你个混蛋
Deal with me, you son of a bitch.

561
00:39:30,170 --> 00:39:34,030
来跟我做交易  我要交易
You deal with me! I want a deal!

562
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:35,820
冷静点  够了
Easy. Come on, man.

563
00:39:35,990 --> 00:39:37,220
冷静点  伙计
Calm down, dude.

564
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:39,080
深呼吸  好吗
Now take a deep breath, all right?

565
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:40,300
你都让他招供了
You got the confession.

566
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:41,620
结果还弄得证供不可采纳
Then you made it inadmissible.

567
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:43,040
你在说什么  他还在招供
What do you fucking mean? He's still talking.

568
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:43,700
他在扯淡
Shucking and jiving.

569
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:44,890
他很清楚你是谁
He knows exactly who you are.

570
00:39:44,890 --> 00:39:46,800
是你们叫我来的  是你们
You called me in here, huh? You did.

571
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,090
我知道  如果我们需要其他帮助
I know, and if we need anything else,

572
00:39:48,090 --> 00:39:48,740
我们会再告诉你的
we'll let you know.

573
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:50,230
多谢你的帮助  警探
We appreciate the assist, detective.

574
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:51,750
你们怎么回事
What the fuck is going on here?

575
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:53,230
我们得挽救这个双重谋杀案的招供
We have to salvage a double murder confession,

576
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:54,510
就这么回事
is what's going on.

577
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:57,430
如果他不是诓你的
If he wasn't just running you in there,

578
00:39:57,430 --> 00:39:59,020
我们会把知道的都告诉你
you'll get anything we get.

579
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:01,020
我保证
You have my word.

580
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:02,290
好了  放松点  冷静
Come on. Ease up, baby. Calm down.

581
00:40:02,290 --> 00:40:03,060
我还会回来的
And I'll be back...

582
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:04,280
知道了
Oh, I got it.

583
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:05,830
明天就来
Tomorrow.

584
00:40:06,790 --> 00:40:08,380
退后  我来
Stay the fuck back. I got it.

585
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:25,440
{\an8}全能牛仔  1982年  哈特

586
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:36,840
在没有时间的永恒中
In eternity, where there is no time,

587
00:40:38,330 --> 00:40:39,850
没有什么会成长
nothing can grow.

588
00:40:39,910 --> 00:40:41,770
没有什么会变化
Nothing can become.

589
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:44,960
没有什么会改变
Nothing changes.

590
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:50,380
所以其实是死亡造就了时间
So death created time

591
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:53,380
让万物生长然后归于死亡
to grow the things that it would kill...

592
00:40:55,690 --> 00:40:57,440
人可以重生
and you are reborn

593
00:40:58,930 --> 00:41:01,410
但坠入同样的生活
but into the same life

594
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:04,590
那个你反复经历的生活
that you've always been born into.

595
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:09,100
这种对话我们有过多少次了  警探们
I mean, how many times have we had this conversation, detectives?

596
00:41:10,290 --> 00:41:11,990
天知道
Well, who knows?

597
00:41:14,650 --> 00:41:17,550
当你想不起自己的生活
When you can't remember your lives,

598
00:41:18,770 --> 00:41:21,740
也就无法改变自己的生活
you can't change your lives,

599
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:27,950
那就是生命既糟糕又秘密的命数所在
and that is the terrible and the secret fate of all life.

600
00:41:30,910 --> 00:41:32,390
你被束缚了
You're trapped...

601
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:39,790
被一直以来惊醒你的噩梦所束缚
by that nightmare you keep waking up into.

602
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,300
你还好吗
You all right?

603
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:50,370
我们得去阿比维尔
We got to go to Abbeville.

604
00:41:51,610 --> 00:41:54,630
今天下午我要上庭作证
Well, I got a deposition this afternoon.

605
00:41:54,630 --> 00:41:55,530
推掉
Aw, push it.

606
00:41:55,530 --> 00:41:56,870
我们必须去跟一个人谈谈
I got somebody we need to talk to.

607
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,220
路上我再跟你解释
I'll tell you on the way.

608
00:41:58,730 --> 00:41:59,820
走吧
Come on.

609
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:06,030
你真觉得  他确实知道些事吗
You really think he's serious about having something,

610
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,300
如果真是那样  又如何
and if so, then what?

611
00:42:12,970 --> 00:42:16,160
雷吉·勒杜活该去死  小马
Reggie Ledoux deserved to die, Marty.

612
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,760
那就是法律的制裁
That was justice.

613
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:21,240
我没想对其他部门指手画脚
I'm not ruling out other agencies.

614
00:42:22,410 --> 00:42:24,600
什么意思
What does that mean?

615
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:27,850
盖伊·弗朗西斯和查理·兰
Guy Francis and Charlie Lange

616
00:42:27,850 --> 00:42:29,730
都提到了黄袍国王
both say the Yellow King.

617
00:42:30,790 --> 00:42:34,210
朵拉·兰也提到过黄袍国王
Dora Lange said the Yellow King.

618
00:42:38,290 --> 00:42:39,110
听着
OK. Look.

619
00:42:39,110 --> 00:42:41,230
如果凶手仍然逍遥法外
If the killer is still out there,

620
00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:43,650
为什么没有继续杀人
why haven't there been more killings?

621
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:45,050
也许有  小马
Well, maybe there have, Marty,

622
00:42:45,050 --> 00:42:46,870
只是我们还不知道
and we just don't know about them,

623
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:48,570
没有把它们串联起来
hadn't put them together.

624
00:42:51,950 --> 00:42:53,400
你有想过为什么1995年
Ever wonder why that task force

625
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:57,320
特别小组那么想接管案子吗
was so hot to take the case back in '95?

626
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:02,140
你想说特别小组与此有关
Are you telling me you think the task force was in on it?

627
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:18,630
我操
Fuck.

628
00:43:25,870 --> 00:43:27,520
这他妈怎么回事
How the fuck does this happen?

629
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:29,580
他知道自己面临的是双重谋杀案的指控
He knew what he was looking at with the double murders.

630
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:31,700
也许他考虑之后做出了选择
Guess he thought about it and made a choice.

631
00:43:33,550 --> 00:43:34,910
这有监控录像
You got a camera feed?

632
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:42,780
就这  倒回去再放
Here. Go back. Play this.

633
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:47,760
他七点十五分跟自己的律师通了话
Took a phone call at 7:15, his lawyer.

634
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:11,890
有音频能听吗  声音
You got audio on this, sound?

635
00:44:11,890 --> 00:44:13,290
没有  只有视频
Nah, just the vid.

636
00:44:18,850 --> 00:44:21,440
就这些了  三小时什么事都没发生
That's it, just 3 hours of nothing...

637
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:24,980
直到你看到血流出来
Till you see the blood.

638
00:44:36,150 --> 00:44:38,380
我们不知道打电话的时候
We don't know what somebody might have told him

639
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:39,180
对方跟他说了什么
on that phone call.

640
00:44:39,190 --> 00:44:42,000
我要看你们的来电记录
I want to see your incoming call logs now.

641
00:44:42,630 --> 00:44:43,800
好
All right.

642
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:46,250
那两位警官叫什么名字
What are the two officers' names?

643
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:48,320
柴尔德里斯和马奥尼
Childress and Mahoney.

644
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:49,950
我要他们的档案
Give me their files, please.

645
00:44:49,950 --> 00:44:51,040
是  长官
Yes, sir.

646
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:19,420
泰伦斯  提取一下这里的指纹
Terrence, get prints on this.

647
00:45:19,590 --> 00:45:20,400
是  长官
Yes, sir.

648
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:22,850
指纹  这可是公用电话
Prints? That's a public phone.

649
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:26,280
律师是不会从这种地方打电话的
No kind of lawyer makes calls from here.

650
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:29,330
佛朗西斯有亲戚吗
Francis have relatives?

651
00:45:29,330 --> 00:45:32,300
有  几个姐妹  几个外甥女和外甥
Yeah--sisters, a few nieces, nephews.

652
00:45:33,130 --> 00:45:35,840
他们怎么跟自杀案联系起来呢
Connects to the suicide, how?

653
00:45:35,890 --> 00:45:37,720
可能有人跟他说了什么
Somebody might have told him something,

654
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:40,560
他别无选择
gave him no choice.

655
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:46,780
太棒了
Well, great.

656
00:45:46,940 --> 00:45:49,070
当他再次着手这件事的时候
So when he got going on this thing again,

657
00:45:49,150 --> 00:45:51,110
他有没有提到过比利·李·塔特尔
did he mention Billy Lee Tuttle?

658
00:45:51,110 --> 00:45:52,660
你明知道他提过
You know that he did.

659
00:45:52,940 --> 00:45:56,360
2010年塔特尔死了
Tuttle died a couple years back, 2010.

660
00:45:56,650 --> 00:45:57,700
是啊
Yeah. Yeah.

661
00:45:57,700 --> 00:46:01,440
混合药物什么的  那又怎样
What was that, mixed medications? So what?

662
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,570
就在科尔再次出现在这里之后
Right after Cohle showed back up in the state.

663
00:46:07,290 --> 00:46:08,390
去死吧
Fuck this.

664
00:46:09,490 --> 00:46:10,700
都是些屁话
Fuck this bullshit.

665
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:12,370
你现在告诉我
You tell me right now

666
00:46:12,370 --> 00:46:15,440
为什么这么关注科尔  不然我马上走人
why you're all over Cohle, or I'll walk.

667
00:46:30,980 --> 00:46:34,310
{\an8}谁杀了我
悬赏一万美元

668
00:47:37,610 --> 00:47:41,400
这是他的记录  报告和陈述  根本不合情理
His record, his reports, his stories, they don't add up.

669
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,000
那就去找他谈
So talk to him about it already.

670
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,800
别来脏我的耳朵
Stop pissing in my ear.

671
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:45,600
我们找他谈过
We did.

672
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:49,340
-是吗  -怎么了
- Oh, you did? - What?

673
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:53,560
如果你们两个跟拉斯特聊过
Well, if you two talked to Rust,

674
00:47:53,690 --> 00:47:55,550
就不是你们掌握他的情况了
you weren't getting a read on him.

675
00:47:56,670 --> 00:47:58,580
而是他掌握了你们
He was getting a read on you.

你们没有查过去的悬案

722
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:48,600
也许你应该别再跟我们耍花招了
Maybe you stop dancing with us.

723

告诉我们你到底在做什么

麻烦稍等下

730
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:24,170
有认识的人吗
Recognize anybody in there?

731
00:50:26,790 --> 00:50:29,060
查尔斯湖有点跟你八字不合  是吧
Lake Charles is a bit out of the way for you, ain't it?

732
00:50:29,210 --> 00:50:31,450
你怎么让她从文件里消失的
How did you keep her out of the papers?

733
00:50:32,020 --> 00:50:36,300
你上面有靠山吗

在附近见过他和他的卡车
and his truck around the location for weeks,

740
00:50:59,650 --> 00:51:01,900
自从他2002年离开之后就消失了
you know he was off the grid after he left in '02,

741
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:05,530
直到2010年才在路易斯安那州出现

但是没有任何人知道
Nobody knows what he's been doing

744
00:51:12,370 --> 00:51:13,310
他那时在做什么

745
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:16,260
在教会总部附近租了个仓库
Got a storage shed near Church Point.

746
00:51:16,610 --> 00:51:18,390
他不让我们看里面是什么
He won't let us see what's inside.

747
00:51:38,530 --> 00:51:40,890
要不你让我们看看里面是什么吧
How about you let us see what you're keeping in storage?

748
00:51:40,890 --> 00:51:43,430
绝对不行  你不能看我的仓库
Fuck no. You can't see my storage unit.

750
00:51:46,150 --> 00:51:48,300
上帝  干点正事

See, how we work it is, we think way back,

754
00:51:52,180 --> 00:51:54,300
你说这案子是莉安·奥利弗干的
you put the case on Rianne Olivier,

755
00:51:54,740 --> 00:51:56,460
说这是她的男朋友干的

也许你们混同一个圈子

也许他们有你的把柄
Maybe they had something on you.

760

你只是揪出适当的凶手

761
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:10,760
把这案子往你希望的方向带

762
00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:14,500
你是个酒鬼  有没有不省人事过
You're a juicer. Ever black out?

763
00:52:14,570 --> 00:52:16,770
有没有清醒过来  却不记得发生过什么
Ever wake up, don't remember what happened?

Beyond that, you wasted my fucking day, company man.

771
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:38,120
现在  他一周四天在酒吧调酒  一个路边酒吧
Now, he bartends 4 days a week, this roadhouse,

772
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:39,710
后面有个小公寓
has a little apartment behind it.

773
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:41,270
此外没有其他的了
No other accounting of this time.

774
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:42,990
据说他还酗酒
Says he drinks.

775
00:53:44,870 --> 00:53:45,740
你错了
You're wrong.

没有人能变这么多  你大错特错了
Nobody could change that much. You are dead wrong.

777
00:53:50,050 --> 00:53:51,190
你一直在告诉我们
Hey, you've been telling us all day

778
00:53:51,190 --> 00:53:53,010
他那些乱七八糟的想法
about the kind of shit he'd think up,

779
00:53:53,010 --> 00:53:54,050
他说话的方式
the way he'd talk.

780
00:53:54,170 --> 00:53:55,590
我们也听了一大堆
We got a good earful of that, too.

781
00:53:55,590 --> 00:53:57,820
你不是要告诉我那是个沉稳的人吧
Are you gonna tell me that's a stable individual?

782
00:53:58,260 --> 00:54:00,240
他可有着油灯枯竭  深陷毒瘾的名声
Left a burnout, junkie rumors.

783
00:54:00,700 --> 00:54:02,020
你觉得酗酒十年
Do you think 10 years on the sauce

784
00:54:02,020 --> 00:54:03,490
会让他变得更理智吗

785
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:06,280
想想吧  你说过
Think about this. You said it.

786
00:54:06,530 --> 00:54:07,970
他来这里三个月
He'd been there 3 months,

787
00:54:08,230 --> 00:54:09,180
你们俩就抓到个炙手可热的罪犯
and you two catch a heater

788
00:54:09,180 --> 00:54:11,020
而在那前后你们都没遇到过
like you've never had before or since,

789
00:54:11,490 --> 00:54:13,800
靠这个他名声大震
one that he shines on.

790
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:15,800
你说他做了件了不起的事情
You're saying he did such a great job.

791
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:19,170
不是他提供的所有证据吗
Didn't he get you every bit of evidence?

792
00:54:19,330 --> 00:54:21,530
不是他牵着你的鼻子走的吗
Didn't he push you where he wanted it to go?

793
00:54:22,210 --> 00:54:24,120
他找到的莉安·奥利弗
He brought you Rianne Olivier.

794
00:54:24,170 --> 00:54:26,050
她压根和勒杜家不沾边
She wasn't one of Ledoux's.

795
00:54:26,940 --> 00:54:28,500
她是他找来的人
She was one of his.

796
00:54:28,730 --> 00:54:30,940
他说过什么来着  "生命就是疾病"
What'd he say, "Life is a disease"?

797
00:54:30,940 --> 00:54:32,550
当他听说阿布维尔的囚犯弗朗西斯
When he heard the Abbeville prisoner Francis

798
00:54:32,550 --> 00:54:34,480
知道些什么  他着手处理了这件事
knew something, he got on it.

799
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:35,770
他把这条线索毁掉了
He shut it down.

800
00:54:35,770 --> 00:54:36,600
你有没有想过是他
You ever thought if he made

801
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:38,260
给那个囚犯打的电话
that phone call to the prisoner,

802
00:54:38,260 --> 00:54:39,390
比如  我不知道
like--I don't know--

803
00:54:39,790 --> 00:54:41,110
那家伙想要勒索他
the guy was trying to blackmail him?

804
00:54:41,110 --> 00:54:42,870
他也这么说过  是吗
He got on that, too, didn't he,

805
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:45,460
他觉得杀害兰的真凶还逍遥法外
the idea that the Lange killer was still out there?

806
00:54:48,570 --> 00:54:49,410
是的
Yeah.

807
00:54:49,850 --> 00:54:52,270
是的  他这么说过
Yeah. He did.

808
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:54,450
可能是在找新的替罪羊
Looking for a new patsy, maybe.

809
00:55:38,750 --> 00:55:40,890
你们的信息量太大我需要消化一下
Y'all given me a lot to absorb.

810
00:55:40,910 --> 00:55:42,810
没错是有很多需要东西消化
Goddamn right it's a lot to absorb.

811
00:55:43,570 --> 00:55:45,090
-所以帮帮我们  -是的
- So help us out. - Yeah.

812
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:47,040
任何你能告诉我们的
Whatever you can tell us

813
00:55:47,050 --> 00:55:48,470
关于  你知道  从他找到

杀害兰的凶手
on the Lange killer you up to

815
00:55:51,340 --> 00:55:52,820
到你们两个之间产生争执
when you two had your altercation.

816
00:55:52,820 --> 00:55:54,530
不管原因是什么
Whatever that was about.
