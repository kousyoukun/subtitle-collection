00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,900
《真·探》
第一季第一集

2
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:14,410
{\an8}录像中

3
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:19,110
你是怎么想的  和他搭档
What'd you think, you paired up with him?

4
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:28,560
{\an8}路易斯安那州  州立警部  刑事调查局
称述人  马丁·艾瑞克·哈特

5
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,140
我怎么想的
What'd I think?

6
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:26,600
父母你没得选
Well, you don't pick your parents,

7
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,610
搭档你也没得选
and you don't pick your partner.

8
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:33,990
以前人们会叫他  税务人
You know, they used to call him The Tax Man for a while?

9
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:38,530
他是德克萨斯来的  没人认识他
He'd come out of Texas, so nobody knew him.

10
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:40,560
我觉得他
Seemed a bit...

11
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:44,370
骨瘦如柴  脾气暴躁
raw-boned to me, edgy.

12
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:48,740
花了3个月时间才请到他去家里吃饭
Took 3 months till we got him over to the house for dinner.

13
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:51,490
正是那件具尸体发现前后
Around our big 419.

14
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:53,680
你们就想听这个  是吗
That's what y'all want to hear about, right,

15
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:56,940
朵拉·兰  树林里的孩子们
Dora Lange, kids in the woods?

16
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:00,010
当然  但是还是谈谈科尔吧
Yeah, sure, but, uh, talk about Cohle.

17
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,060
我们听过他的一些事情
We heard some stories.

18
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:03,790
挺奇怪的一个人  不是吗
Kind of a strange guy, huh?

19
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:08,020
奇怪
Strange.

20
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,570
是啊
Yeah.

21
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:15,340
拉斯特是那种如果他不喜欢天的蓝色
Rust would pick a fight with the sky

22
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:17,340
就会和天空干一架的那种人
if he didn't like its shade of blue,

23
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:23,010
但是他来家里吃晚饭的时候
but when we finally got him over to the house--

24
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,270
当时这案子正是热门
this is when that case was hot--

25
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:27,180
可怜的家伙看起来好像
poor bastard looked like he was on his way

26
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:29,480
正要去上刑场
to the firing squad.

27
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:33,060
朵拉·兰
Dora Lange.

28
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:36,270
那是个神秘的  宗教式的谋杀
Yeah. Occult ritual murder.

29
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:45,530
{\an8}路易斯安那州  州立警部  刑事调查局
称述人  拉斯特·斯班瑟·科尔
2012年4月26日

30
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,650
多"亏"了那些广告
You can thank the "Advertiser" for that.

31
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:41,680
你能别在这里抽吗
Could you, uh, hold off on that?

32
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,110
你不能在这里抽烟
You can't do that here no more.

33
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:48,250
别犯混了
Don't be assholes.

34
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:49,990
你们还想不想听了
You want to hear this or not?

35
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:11,770
梵米伦治安官请求协助调查一具尸体
Vermillion sheriff requested assistance with a 419,

36
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:13,980
就在伊拉斯外的甘蔗田里
cane fields outside of Erath.

37
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:17,510
我那时刚工作三个月
I'd been on the job about 3 months till then.

38
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:20,320
办了两个案子
Two previous cases were open and shut.

39
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:27,810
那是1995年1月3日  我女儿的生日
It was January 3, 1995, my daughter's birthday.

40
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:30,000
我记得很清楚
I remember.

41
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:57,200
哈特和科尔  州属刑事调查员
Hart and Cohle, State CID.

42
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,710
谁发现她的
Who found her?

43
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:01,620
一个农民和他儿子
Farmer and his son.

44
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,200
这块地里不应该有东西在烧
This spread wasn't scheduled for a burn.

45
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:07,670
封锁这一带  把路封起来
Let's keep them here, and let's tape off this road,

46
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:09,450
把你的记录给我
and give me your log.

47
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:16,230
你来做记录
You take the log.

48
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:17,120
是的  长官
Yes, sir.

49
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,420
把所有东西都记下来
Make sure you get everything down.

50
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:34,360
你上吧
Go ahead.

51
00:05:58,420 --> 00:05:59,970
你见过这种情况吗
You ever see something like this?

52
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:03,360
八年的刑事调查  从来没有
No, sir, in 8 years of CID.

53
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:07,660
都是标志  撒旦的印记
Them symbols, they's Satanic.

54
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:10,610
几年前有人预见过它
They had a "20/20" On it a few years back.

55
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,800
查出身份了吗
I.D.?

56
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,250
还没有
No, sir.

57
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:19,510
需要更多人做拉网式搜查
We're gonna need more men for a grid search,

58
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:24,200
在三条路上都设立封锁线  越远越好
set up a perimeter wide as possible on those 3 roads,

59
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,760
贴出告示  记下所有通过车辆车牌号
post up, take license plates of anything that passes.

60
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:30,220
这是I23
I-23.

61
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:31,980
请讲  I23
Go ahead, I-23.

62
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,880
我们需要调查员协助调查这具尸体
We're gonna need investigator assist on that 419,

63
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:38,850
所有你能调动的人
all you can spare for a canvass.

64
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:39,610
收到  警探
Roger that, detective.

65
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:41,290
刑事调查局接管了  把所有有空的人都找来
CID is taking over. Get anybody who's free up here.

66
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:44,250
说说你查出了些什么
OK. Tell me what you see.

67
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:49,590
她的手腕  脚踝和膝盖有勒痕
Ligature marks on her wrists, ankles, and knees.

68
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:53,190
腹部有多处刺伤  伤口较浅
Multiple shallow stab wounds to the abdomen.

69
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:55,540
喉部有出血
Hemorrhaging around throat,

70
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:59,050
肩部  大腿和躯干均有淤血
lividity at the shoulders, thighs, and torso.

71
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,370
在他移动她之前
She'd been on her back a while

72
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:05,920
被平躺放置了一段时间
before he moved her.

73
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:15,960
所以他们才叫他税务人
That's why they called him The Tax Man.

74
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:20,120
我们其他人不过是有个小本子
The rest of us had these little note pads or something.

75
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:22,850
而他则是有一大本记事薄
He had this big ledger.

76
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:27,060
带着这本子到处走像个税务人  很搞笑
Looked funny walking door to door with it like the tax man,

77
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:30,850
从外号上来说到也不算差
which ain't bad as far as nicknames go.

78
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:35,200
没错  我是会记很多笔记
Yeah. Of course I've always taken a lot of notes.

79
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:38,920
你永远也不知道会遇到什么事  不是吗
I mean, you never know what the thing's gonna be, do you?

80
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:42,600
也许本子上记得东西某一天
A little detail somewhere way down the line

81
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:47,220
会让你惊呼一声  破了案子
makes you say, "Ohh!", breaks the case.

82
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:50,370
我见过很多种人
You know, I've seen all the different types.

83
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:52,700
我们每个人都符合某个分类
We all fit a certain category--

84
00:07:53,760 --> 00:08:01,160
恶霸  迷人精  代父
the bully, the charmer, the, uh, surrogate dad,

85
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:06,560
狂怒之人  有脑子的
the man possessed by ungovernable rage, the brain--

86
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:12,720
每一种都可能是个好警探
and any of those types could be a good detective,

87
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,410
也有可能是不称职的脑残货
and any of those types could be an incompetent shitheel.

88
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:18,890
你是哪一种
Which type were you?

89
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:24,910
我是最普通的那一种
Oh, I was just a regular type dude

90
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,990
就是派头比较大
with a big-ass dick.

91
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:33,190
这些分类源于他们如何对待上级
A lot of it had to do with how they manage authority.

92
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:40,820
对上级  对警惕心来说  也许是个负担
There can be a burden in authority, in vigilance,

93
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:44,750
就像是父亲的负担
like a father's burden.

94
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,180
有些人承受不了
It was too much for some men.

95
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:51,560
不为所动的聪明人很少
A smart guy who's steady is hard to find.

96
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:54,900
我还不错  比某些人强
I was all right, better than some,

97
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:59,830
我知道怎么跟人交谈  我可以不为所动
but I knew how to talk to people, and I was steady.

98
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:06,260
拉斯特  他原先在德克萨斯州的文件被密封了
Rust--now his Texas files were classified

99
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:10,260
或修改了  他不怎么喜欢说话
or redacted, and he wasn't big on talking

100
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,680
但是你想让他闭嘴的时候又滔滔不绝
except when you wanted him to shut up,

101
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:16,580
但他很聪明
but he was smart.

102
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:23,740
我们搭档的第二周
Yeah. Second week we were together,

103
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:26,140
我看到了他住的地方
I saw where he was living.

104
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:29,370
让我对他产生了同情
Kind of made me feel for the guy.

105
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,940
我应该请你坐的  但是
I'd offer you a seat, but, uh...

106
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:49,950
没关系  我不会待久的
Don't mention it. I, uh--I can't stay.

107
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:57,200
{\an8}性犯罪

108
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:55,910
跟你们说
Yeah, I'll tell you guys--

109
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:58,200
相信我  上了年纪之后
and believe me, past a certain age,

110
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:02,390
没有家庭的男人很可怕
a man without a family can be a bad thing.

111
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:33,580
我们遇到了一个非典型精神病
We'd encountered a meta-psychotic,

112
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:38,440
我还得向小马解释
which I had to explain to Marty,

113
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:41,470
非典型精神病是什么
what meta-psychotic was.

114
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:48,520
还会再发生的
This is gonna happen again,

115
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:53,300
或者之前发生过  也有可能两者都是
or it's happened before, both.

116
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:56,210
继续
Go on.

117
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,780
这是幻像中的执法  宗教仪式
It's fantasy enactment, ritual,

118
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:05,010
神灵崇拜  象征化
fetishization, iconography.

119
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:07,170
这是他所看到的异象
This is his vision.

120
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:09,850
她的身体就是一张象征爱的地图
Her body is a paraphilic love map.

121
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,320
为什么这么说
How's that?

122
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:14,730
将身体上的肉欲依附在
An attachment of physical lust

123
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:18,350
被社会所不容的幻想和实践上
to fantasies and practices forbidden by society.

124
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:23,240
你是从你那些书里看到的
You get that from one of your books?

125
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:24,910
是的
I did.

126
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:31,190
她的膝盖被磨破了  毯子在她背上被点燃
Her knees are abraded, rug burns on her back.

127
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,930
唇疱疹  牙龈凹陷  牙齿不好
Cold sores, gum line recession, bad teeth.

128
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:36,610
她极有可能是个妓女
There's decent odds she was a prost.

129
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:39,100
他也许不认识她  但是
He might not have known her, but...

130
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:43,250
这不是一时兴起
this idea goes way back with him.

131
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:49,150
你的书里有教你不看线索
You--you got a chapter in one of those books

132
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:51,470
直接下结论吗
on jumping to conclusions?

133
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:55,470
你在证据上附加了你的假设
You attach an assumption to a piece of evidence,

134
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:59,620
然后歪曲事实来支持你的假设
you start to bend the narrative to support it,

135
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:02,030
你自己也就被影响了
prejudice yourself.

136
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:07,350
等查出身份之后看吧
Wait and see on the I.D.

137
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:12,290
好吧
All right.

138
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,420
这种事不会凭空发生的
This kind of thing does not happen in a vacuum.

139
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:19,770
我保证这不是他第一次犯案
I guarantee this wasn't his first.

140
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,660
太过特殊了
It's too specific.

141
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:39,540
听着  这个时候
Listen, uh--ahem, this is a...

142
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:45,530
提起这事可能不太好  但是
stupid time to mention this, but...

143
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:49,240
来我家吃晚饭吧
you've got to come to dinner.

144
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,940
没办法再跟玛姬推迟了
Can't put Maggie off anymore,

145
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:55,030
你必须来
so you just got to.

146
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:03,160
好的
All right.

147
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:13,470
-戈登  谢谢你过来  -小马
- Gordon, thanks for coming. - Marty.

148
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:18,750
那天晚上  太阳还没下山呢
Anyway, that evening, wasn't even sundown,

149
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:21,750
他邀请我去他家吃晚餐
he decided it was a good time to invite me over for dinner,

150
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,380
我不是很情愿
which I got a problem with,

151
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,240
因为我会想到小马的妻子
all right, because I'm thinking about Marty's wife

152
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:30,460
他的两个孩子  今天又是我女儿的生日
and this two kids and how it's my daughter's birthday,

153
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:31,940
我也知道
and I know...

154
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,660
我什么都做不了
there's nothing I can do about it,

155
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:39,370
总有那么一天
maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but...

156
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,910
我要好好喝一杯
I'm gonna have a drink.

157
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:45,910
我来开
Let me get up!

158
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:47,150
爸爸
Daddy!

159
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:49,670
你马上就能看到他了  我得去开门
You're gonna meet him. I got to get the door.

160
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:57,620
圣诞老人来了
Santa Claus is coming!

161
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,870
跳吧
Aah! Jump!

162
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:13,360
这里的人们
People out here,

163
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:17,940
好像不知道外面还有个世界一样
it's like they don't even know the outside world exists.

164
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:22,070
跟住在月亮上没什么两样
Might as well be living in the fucking moon.

165
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,880
世界上什么样的区都有
There's all kinds of ghettos in the world.

166
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:30,020
世界上只有一个区
It's all one ghetto, man,

167
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:33,640
不过是宇宙里的一个破水沟
giant gutter in outer space.

168
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,610
今天  那个现场
Today, that scene,

169
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:45,650
那是我遇到过的最糟的事情
that is the most fucked up thing I ever caught.

170
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:49,540
问你点儿事
Ask you something?

171
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:51,830
你是基督教徒吗
You're a Christian, yeah?

172
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:55,210
不是
No.

173
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,560
那为什么你的公寓里有个十字架
Well, then what do you got the cross for in your apartment?

174
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:03,440
那是用来冥想的
That's a form of meditation.

175
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,390
怎么做
How's that?

176
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:12,570
我在花园里静谧
I contemplate the moment in the garden,

177
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:17,680
思考如何磨练自身
the idea of allowing your own crucifixion.

178
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:24,490
但你不是基督徒
But you're not a Christian.

179
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:26,100
那你相信什么
So what do you believe?

180
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:28,090
我相信人们不应该在工作时
I believe that people shouldn't talk

181
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:29,660
讨论这些乱七八糟的东西
about this type of shit at work.

182
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:31,280
等等
Hold on, hold on.

183
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:35,400
我们搭档了3个月了
Uh...3 months we been together,

184
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,230
我对你毫无了解
I get nothing from you.

185
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:40,790
今天  我们所面临的这一情况
Today, what we're into now,

186
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:42,660
就当是帮个忙  好吗
do me a courtesy, OK?

187
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:44,530
我不是要改变你什么
I'm not trying to convert you.

188
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:47,040
我觉得我是个现实主义者
Look. I consider myself a realist, all right,

189
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,530
但是从哲学上来说  我是个悲观主义者
but in philosophical terms, I'm what's called a pessimist.

190
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:52,900
说明什么
Um, OK. What's that mean?

191
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,510
说明我不适合参加派对
Means I'm bad at parties.

192
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:58,350
跟你说吧
Heh. Let me tell you.

193
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:00,630
反正你哪里都不适合
You ain't great outside of parties either.

194
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,670
我认为人类的意识
I think human consciousness

195
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:12,210
是进化中一个可悲的错误
was a tragic misstep in evolution.

196
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,820
我们对自己认知得太多
We became too self-aware.

197
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:18,680
自然从自身中抽离出一部分又化为自然
Nature created an aspect of nature separate from itself.

198
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:22,730
从自然法则上来说  我们是不该存在生物
We are creatures that should not exist by natural law.

199
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:25,890
听起来真可怕  拉斯特
Huh. That sounds god-fucking-awful, Rust.

200
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:29,020
我们被我们有自我这一幻觉
We are things that labor under the illusion

201
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:30,720
所奴役了
of having a self,

202
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:34,700
感官上的体验和感觉相结合
this accretion of sensory experience and feeling,

203
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:39,790
被设定好了相信我们每个人都是某个人
programmed with total assurance that we are each somebody

204
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:42,770
而事实上  我们谁都不是
when, in fact, everybody's nobody.

205
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:45,260
我要是你的话  就不会到处跟人胡说八道
I wouldn't go around spouting that shit, I was you.

206
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:48,170
这里的人可不这么想
People around here don't think that way.

207
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:49,150
我也不这么想
I don't think that way.

208
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:51,800
对世界上各个物种来说  最崇高的事
I think the honorable thing for species to do

209
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,890
就是拒绝被设定
is deny our programming,

210
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:56,870
停止繁殖
stop reproducing,

211
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:00,210
手牵手走向灭亡
walk hand in hand into extinction,

212
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,790
最后一晚  兄弟姐妹们
one last midnight, brothers and sisters

213
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:04,730
寻求生命的公正
opting out of a raw deal.

214
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:11,360
那每天早上还起来干什么
So what's the point of getting out bed in the morning?

215
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,540
我告诉自己是为了证明
I tell myself I bear witness,

216
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:17,550
但其实我只是被如此设定了
but the real answer is that it's obviously my programming,

217
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:21,300
我又没有勇气自杀
and I lack the constitution for suicide.

218
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:25,270
我选了今天想了解你还真是"好"运气
My luck, I picked today to get to know you.

219
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:28,630
三个月  你一句话都没说过
3 months, I don't hear a word from you, and--

220
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:29,730
-你问的  -是啊
- You asked. - Yeah.

221
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:32,880
现在我请你闭嘴
And now I'm begging you to shut the fuck up.

222
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:43,390
我尝到了一些不好的味道
I get a bad taste in my mouth out here.

223
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:47,170
铝  灰
Aluminum, ash,

224
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:51,440
好像能嗅出精神病的恐惧
like you can smell the psycho's fear.

225
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,560
我有个主意
I got an idea.

226
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:56,610
从现在起  让我们在这辆车里
Let's make the car a place of silent reflection

227
00:17:56,610 --> 00:17:59,670
静谧沉思  如何
from now on, OK?

228
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:06,020
{\an8}谁杀了我
悬赏一万美元

229
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,990
我晚上该带点啥
What should I bring for dinner?

230
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:18,110
一瓶酒就好了
A bottle of wine would be nice, I guess.

231
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:21,710
我不喝酒
I don't drink.

232
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,620
你当然不喝  拉斯特
Well, no, of course not, Rust.

233
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:27,420
你在我家的时候
Listen. When you're at my house,

234
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:29,380
给我表现的规矩点
I want you to chill the fuck out.

235
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:32,480
不要提任何你刚才跟我说的那番屁话
Don't even mention any of that bullshit you just said to me.

236
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,690
当然不会  小马
Of course not, Marty.

237
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:36,060
我还没疯
I'm not some kind of maniac, all right?

238
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,060
我的老天
I mean, for fuck's sake.

239
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:55,540
{\an8}路易斯安那州
刑事调查局

240
00:18:56,290 --> 00:18:57,190
你听说什么了
What'd you hear?

241
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:58,190
问科尔
Ask Cohle.

242
00:18:58,190 --> 00:18:59,660
问那个税务人
You mean The Tax Man?

243
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:01,360
他脑子可不正常
You know, he's IA.

244
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,590
这是州立刑事调查局凶杀组  杰瑞西警探
This is State CID Homicide-- Detective Geraci.

245
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:08,050
好的  女士
Yes, ma'am.

246
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,050
我打来是想问你那天晚上
I'm calling to ask about that night...

247
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:14,490
这是你以前从来没听说过的事情
I mean, you never heard any shit like this before.

248
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:15,550
她有
She had...

249
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:19,440
鹿角
antlers. Um...

250
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,560
操
Fuck.

251
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:22,520
这是真的
This is--this is the real thing,

252
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:25,950
类似万圣节的装扮
some "Halloween" shit.

253
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:32,190
我们要开场新闻发布会
Well, we're gonna have to do a press conference.

254
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,810
他怎么样  你怎么想
What about him? What do you think?

255
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43,050
聪明
Smart...

256
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:45,970
冷漠
aloof.

257
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:48,730
不在乎有没有朋友
Doesn't care about making friends,

258
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:51,350
不过已经上正轨了
but he's already running with it.

259
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:54,470
他对这案子有点想法
He's got a real-- real mind for it.

260
00:19:57,370 --> 00:19:58,860
所以你会继续带着他
So you'd keep him on then?

261
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:06,650
是我们俩  我会的
Both of us, yeah. I would.

262
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:09,730
好  你领头
All right. You're still lead.

263
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:12,140
事件室归你了
The incident room is yours,

264
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:15,460
明天你来介绍案情
and, uh, you do the briefing tomorrow.

265
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:17,350
是的  长官  谢谢
Yes, sir. Thank you.

266
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:24,050
你好  长官
Hello, sir.

267
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:30,920
真他妈扯淡
Fuck that prick.

268
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:37,760
我听不见你在说什么
Yeah. No. I couldn't hear you there.

269
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:38,860
鹿角还是什么的
Antlers and shit.

270
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:41,690
我就这个意思  我想让你见她
That's my point, I wanted you to see her.

271
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:45,530
她有鹿角  那是什么意思
She had antlers? What does that mean?

272
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:47,290
那是王冠
It was a crown.

273
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:52,010
明天早上会做案情介绍  一大早
We'll do the briefing tomorrow, guys, early.

274
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:55,600
媒体联络人在问撒旦崇拜的事
My guy does the AP wire asked about Satanism.

275
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,910
司碧思在问  他会不停追问的
It got Speece here. You're gonna have his nose up your ass.

276
00:20:58,910 --> 00:21:01,520
组长说要开新闻发布会
Major was saying something about a press conference.

277

幸好有你们的"祝福"

278
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:05,520
多谢了
Thanks for that.

279
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:20,890
我先走一步没问题吧
Hey. You mind if I skate?

280
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:25,650
我从扫黄组  妓院问来几个名字

281
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:27,820
在数据库里查了查

282
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:31,120
要我跟你已弃去吗
You want me to go with you?

283
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,330
不用  小事一桩
Nah. Just something to do.

284
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:39,400
你去吧  我会把文件处理好的
Yeah. You go ahead. I'll take care of the paperwork.

285
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:45,410
正如我说过的  我感觉在此时
Like I said, I'm feeling a lot of stuff

286
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:47,800

以及
and, um...

289
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,520
我觉得会一直查案
figured I'd work the case, you know,

290
00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:00,360
直到迪切洛打电话或者我们查出被害人的身份
till DiCillo called or we got an I.D.

291
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:05,930
州立扫黄部给了我几个地址
State Vice gave me some addresses to follow up on.

292
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:10,010

295
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:53,200
别这样
Oh, come on, man.

296
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:55,010
下一轮我请

不  我只是想查点消息

00:23:06,770 --> 00:23:10,880
给我们来两杯大杯的长岛冰茶

304
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:14,370

人们来来往往

我不抓卖淫的
I wouldn't bust somebody for hooking

320

No. Quaaludes, anything-barbital.

335
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,800
兴奋剂更好搞
Uppers are easier to get,

336
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,380
效果也更持久
and they last longer, too.

337
00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:45,680
我知道  但我不是想爽
Yeah, but it's not like that.

338
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,660
那是想干嘛

你怎么坐这儿了
Why you out here, huh?

344
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:38,750
怎么不去床上睡
Why didn't you come to bed?

345

昨天看见了不好的东西

346

347
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,100
伊拉斯那个女人的案子吗
You got that woman from Erath?

348
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,230

352
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:12,830
天哪  得赶紧洗个澡

353
00:27:13,870 --> 00:27:15,460
今天要介绍案情
Got a debriefing today

354
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:18,220
之后可能还有新闻发布会

355
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:25,630
要是司碧思来电话
And if Speece calls,

356
00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:27,680
跟他说我整个早上都在介绍案情
tell him I'm debriefing the squad all morning.

357
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,100
小马说他去做了
Well, Marty said he was doing that.

358
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:30,190
是啊
He is.

359
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:31,520
早上好  美女

360
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:33,510
早上好
Morning, baby.

361
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:35,550
小马  咖啡里要加什么
Marty, how you want your coffee, doll?

362
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:37,470
加浓黑咖啡  就像你一样
Strong and black just like you.

363
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:41,280
指纹结果出来了  受害人是朵拉·凯丽·兰

她死前已经洗干净了

没有发现指纹
not a print on her.

375
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:09,950
手腕和脚踝发现了勒痕

376
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:11,850
是半英寸粗的绳子勒的

绑了十到二十小时

00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:31,110
不好说
Hard to say.

385
00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:32,880
得等质谱仪检测结果
Got to wait for a mass spec.

386
00:28:34,210 --> 00:28:37,210
就是说  她被人下药  捆绑
So she was drugged, bound,

387
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,630
用刀折磨

390
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:51,070
这个东西呢
What about this stuff?

391
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:54,100
我只能暂时称其为王冠
Well, the crown, for lack of a better word,

392
00:28:55,010 --> 00:28:59,240
由玫瑰刺  嫩藤条和柳条
rose thorns, early cane, switchgrass

393
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:02,030
绕着弯曲的树枝编成
wrapped around a bent branch,

394
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:06,320
这个角是鹿角
and the horns are deer antlers.

395
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,620
而且  都没发现指纹
Again, no prints on anything.

396
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:11,450
符号是用蓝色树脂画成的
Symbols are painted with acrylic basic blue

397
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:13,320
戴了塑胶手套
using a thick glove finger.

398
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:15,370
这些符号有什么含义吗
Ideas what any of this means?

399
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:16,680
我不知道
I don't know.

400
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:20,880
都是原始图案  像是洞穴的壁画
And it's all primitive. It's like cave paintings.

401
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:23,120
也许你们应该找个人类学家
Maybe you ought to talk to an anthropologist.

402
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:35,810
{\an8}证物

403
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:40,260
看来这男的麻烦不小
Lot of trouble this guy went to.

404
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:42,240
看着像私人恩怨
Seems real personal.

405
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:44,650
我看不像
I don't think so.

406
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:48,370
有象征意味  有预谋的
Was iconic, planned...

407
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:51,220
而且不像是私人恩怨
and in some ways, it was impersonal.

408
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:52,990
她的眼睛被蒙住了
Think of the blindfold.

409
00:29:58,010 --> 00:30:00,330
这地方就像某人
This place is like somebody's memory

410
00:30:00,330 --> 00:30:02,510
对镇子的记忆  慢慢消散着
of the town, and the memory's fading.

411
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,670
好像从没有过人类的痕迹
It's like there was never anything here but jungle.

412
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:11,050
别多愁善感了  真不专业
Stop saying shit like that. It's unprofessional.

413
00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:12,920
是这样吗
Oh, is that what I'm going for here?

414
00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:17,180
我只是让你别再说奇怪的话
I just want you to stop saying odd shit,

415
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,970
比如你嗅到了精神病的恐惧
like you smell a psycho's fear

416
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:21,480
或是你在什么消散的记忆里边
or you're in someone's faded memory of a town.

417
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,480
别说了
Just stop.

418
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:24,410
我花了那么久
Well, given how long it's taken for me

419
00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:26,470
才接受自己的本性
to reconcile my nature,

420
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:28,410
不可能因为你而放弃它  小马
I can't figure I'd forgo it on your account, Marty.

421
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:47,200
你昨晚睡着了吗
You get any sleep last night?

422
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:49,430
我不睡觉
I don't sleep.

423
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:51,480
我只做梦
I just dream.

424
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,100
神秘的
Occult.

425
00:30:53,870 --> 00:30:56,830
{\an8}伊拉斯外的神秘谋杀案

426
00:30:55,930 --> 00:30:58,570
我只觉得这鬼东西很疯狂
Now, I don't know if this shit is anything but crazy,

427
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,670
不过司碧思和局长
but Speece and the Superintendent,

428
00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:03,890
已经在留意了  报纸也在瞎掺和
they're paying attention, the newspapers are making hay,

429
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:06,310
还有教会团体
church groups.

430
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:08,130
警探
Detective?

431
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:11,970
好  这是我们目前掌握的线索
All right, here's what we got so far.

432
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:15,630
死者名叫朵拉·凯丽·兰  28岁
Deceased's name is Dora Kelly Lange, 28...

433
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:18,600
你现在还在忙吗  那些生意
You stay busy now, the business?

434
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,860
是的  安保公司要忙
Well, yeah, I got the security firm,

435
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:23,040
线人的活儿  都习惯了
P.I. stuff. Routine.

436
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:25,930
很多人都离开了
Lotta guys leave the job,

437
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,060
墓地就在附近
cemetery within 10.

438
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,970
没家没产
No family, idle hands.

439
00:31:31,870 --> 00:31:35,960
建议就是  要做就得全力做
Some advice: you make it out, you stay busy.

440
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,550
边边角角都别放过
Hit the corners.

441
00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:39,970
问她都见过谁
Ask about anybody she was seeing:

442
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,170
常客  毒贩
regular customers, meth dealers,

443
00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:45,180
路人甲  所有人
and rough johns, anything.

444
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:47,820
有问题吗
Any questions?

445
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,330
你信鬼吗
You believe in ghosts?

446
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:23,070
我们不是说过要静谧沉思吗
What'd we say about silent reflection?

447
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:35,670
上午10点到下午1点之间
You happen to hear anything out of the ordinary

448
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:39,160
你有听到那边有什么不寻常的动静吗
between 10 and 1 a.m., out back?

449
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:41,840
没有  但是
No, no, but, uh,

450
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:44,520
有时候他们会去外面猎鸽
sometimes they, uh, dove-hunt out there.

451
00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:46,530
是他们发现了一个女人吗
They found a woman?

452
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:50,030
名叫方特诺特的姑娘吗
Is it the Fontenot girl?

453
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:51,510
谁
Who?

454
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:54,500
-你为什么要问这个  -我也不知道
- And why would you ask that? - Don't know.

455
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:56,640
那女孩前些年失踪了
Went missing around here years back.

456
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:58,850
这里最近一次出的就这事了
Last time something happened.

457
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:00,780
我想着没准是那姑娘
Just thought maybe it's her.

458
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:03,050
那姑娘多大年纪
How old was she, this girl?

459
00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:04,510
我也不知道  很小
I don't know. Little.

460
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:08,450
你知道她家人住在哪吗
You know where the family lives?

461
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:22,270
以前住在几条街开外
Had a place couple streets down.

462
00:33:24,090 --> 00:33:25,440
可是已经搬走了
They moved out, though.

463
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:29,610
你认识名叫方特诺特的女孩吗  失踪的那个
Do you know the Fontenot girl, one went missing?

464
00:33:29,610 --> 00:33:30,570
她吗
Her?

465
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:33,960
他的家人来礼拜过
Her family come to our service

466
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,910
就一两次  五六年前了
once or twice, 5 or 6 years back.

467
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,390
难道是她吗  主啊
Is that the girl? Oh, Lord.

468
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:41,650
不  先生  不是
No, sir, it's not.

469
00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:44,150
打搅一下
Excuse me.

470
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:47,400
我想问你们点儿事  你们认为
I want to ask y'all something. Y'all think

471
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,320
会不会跟那些猫有关系
maybe this have something to do with those cats?

472
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,650
什么猫
What cats?

473
00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:53,040
有两只猫  开始是一只  过了两周
Two of 'em -- one, and a couple

474
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,370
又发现一只
of weeks later, another.

475
00:33:54,770 --> 00:33:56,220
有人把它们开膛了
Somebody cut 'em up,

476
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:58,060
肚子翻到外面来  把它们
turned their insides out, then nailed them

477
00:33:58,060 --> 00:33:59,720
钉在大门上  两次
to the front door, twice.

478
00:34:00,130 --> 00:34:02,400
我叫了警察
Now, I called and told the police,

479
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:05,360
可是我们的会众主要是非裔美国人
but we're predominantly African American congregation.

480
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:07,920
我要求过调查
I asked for it to be investigated.

481
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:11,150
我们不处理这类情况  先生
We're not those type of police, sir.

482
00:34:12,930 --> 00:34:14,310
那谁负责呢
Well, who is, then?

483
00:34:19,050 --> 00:34:20,260
我能问你点事吗
Can I ask you something?

484
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:26,680
这些有你眼熟的吗
Any of these look familiar to you?

485
00:34:26,850 --> 00:34:28,750
-在哪见过吗  -没有
- Seen them anywheres? - No.

486
00:34:28,890 --> 00:34:30,840
没有  看着好像是
No, they look like something that might be

487
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,780
刻在树上或其他地方的东西
carved into a tree or something.

488
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:34,570
这个呢
Mm-hmm. How about these?

489
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,720
这个很想我还是小孩的时候
Now, that look like something my old auntie

490
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:40,050
我阿姨教我们做的东西
taught us how to make when I was a tyke.

491
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:41,490
这些是什么东西
What are they?

492
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:44,850
有人说这是"捕鸟陷阱"
Some folks call them bird traps.

493
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,410
阿姨说这些是恶魔网
Old Auntie told us that they were devil nets.

494
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:48,990
你把它们安在床的周围
You put them around the bed,

495
00:34:48,990 --> 00:34:50,830
就能在他来到床边之前困住他
catch the devil before he get too close.

496
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:52,320
有点意思
That's interesting.

497
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:54,490
她是个非常奇妙的女人
Hmm. She was a wonderful woman.

498
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:58,760
耶稣爱她  但她骨子里
Loved her some Jesus, but had a bit

499
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,510
还是有点萨泰里阿[非洲土著宗教]
of that Santeria in her, you know?

500
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,350
我一直认为那只是
I always just thought it was something

501
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:05,740
逗小孩玩的  让他们有事可做
for children to do, keep 'em busy,

502
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:08,700
给他们讲为什么把小棍绑在一起
tell them stories why they're tying sticks together.

503
00:35:10,270 --> 00:35:12,440
这就是我们查到的关于方特诺特女孩的一切
Then that's all we got on the Fontenot girl.

504
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:14,720
这里什么都没有
There was nothing in there.

505
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:16,900
只说"也许是错报"
Says, "Possible report made in error."

506
00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:18,630
那是五年前了
Now, that was 5 years ago.

507
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:20,360
那时泰德·柴尔德里斯是治安官
Ted Childress was sheriff back then.

508
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,270
我想他现在住在湾岸
He's set up in Gulf Shores now, I think.

509
00:35:23,270 --> 00:35:26,070
十岁女孩失踪  没闹得全州沸沸扬扬吗
Ten-year-old girl goes missing and that doesn't go state-wide?

510
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:27,960
等等  据我所知
Now, hold on now. My understanding,

511
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,510
这女孩跟他生父断绝了关系
the little girl went off with her birth daddy.

512
00:35:29,650 --> 00:35:31,320
你们有没有查她妈妈的记录
Now, did you check her mom's record?

513
00:35:29,650 --> 00:35:33,990
{\an8}治安官  泰特

514
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:34,070
持有违禁品  接客
Possession, solicitation.

515
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:37,060
泰德认识这家人  而且他感觉
I believe Ted knew the family, and the feeling was

516
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:38,810
小女孩跟她生父断绝来往会比较好
the little girl was better off with her daddy.

517
00:35:38,830 --> 00:35:41,970
她妈妈也同意  她提出过指控
Mom seemed to agree; she filed a complaint,

518
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:43,560
之后再没管过了
then never bothered with it again,

519
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:44,850
跟她男朋友跑了
took off with her boyfriend.

520
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:48,230
记录鉴定部门收到过你的指控
R&I said you had a complaint these parts

521
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:50,400
12月左右  一个小姑娘
around December -- little girl

522
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,960
被追到树林里
getting chased through the woods.

523
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:54,330
有  我把那文件也找出来了
Oh, yeah, I pulled that one for you, too.

524
00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:04,680
这什么玩意
What the hell is this?

525
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:07,460
小姑娘说有个绿耳朵的意大利面怪
Little girl said a green-eared spaghetti monster

526
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:08,880
在树林里追她
chased her through some woods.

527
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,440
我们按她的描述画了一下
Now, we had her work with a sketch artist,

528
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:14,610
就是这个样子
and she told us that looked exactly right.

529
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:17,550
你如果想用这画发布通缉令  请自便
Now, you want to call an APB on that, you go right ahead.

530
00:36:20,270 --> 00:36:20,870
不好意思
Listen, boys.

531
00:36:20,870 --> 00:36:23,160
暂停一下  我要喝点啤酒
I'm gonna have to call a timeout, make a beer run.

532
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:25,030
先忍一会
Well, why don't you hold off on that for a while?

533
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:30,510
那你给我买回来吧
All right, well, why don't you get it, then?

534
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:32,920
真的不行
We really don't want to do that.

535
00:36:33,730 --> 00:36:36,810
喝啤酒都不行吗
Well, is this supposed to be admissible?

536
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:41,070
想让我给你们干活
If you want to pick my brain, work a room,

537
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:43,420
就得让我吃饱喝足
you buy me a cheeseburger and a Coke, don't you?

538
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:48,150
我要六听装的老密尔沃基
I'll take a sixer of Old Milwaukee

539
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:50,050
或是孤星啤酒  不要高度数的
or Lone Star, nothing snooty.

540
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:52,560
你为什么突然提这个要求
Why is this so important to you all of a sudden?

541
00:36:52,930 --> 00:36:55,260
因为今天周四  现在是下午
'Cause it's Thursday and it's past noon.

542
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:58,660
我周四要休息的
Thursday is one of my days off.

543
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:01,710
休息日下午要喝酒
On my off days, I start drinking at noon.

544
00:37:02,990 --> 00:37:04,700
这习惯不能变
You don't get to interrupt that.

545
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:25,180
麻烦你快一点哟
I'd appreciate a little hustle up on that.

546
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,040
昨天
Yesterday,

547
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:31,290
大约早上六点
at approximately 6 a.m.,

548
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:34,770
有人在伊拉斯外的甘蔗田里
civilians came across the body of a female

549
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:37,800
发现了一具女尸
in a sugar cane field outside of Erath.

550
00:37:38,970 --> 00:37:40,820
我们推断是谋杀
Now, this person, we believe, was murdered,

551
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:43,410
但是目前我们还不能公布
and we are not yet in a position to

552
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:46,810
受害者的身份  或是提供
release the identity of the victim or to offer

553
00:37:46,810 --> 00:37:48,470
案情细节
details of the crime.

554
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,360
我们的探员
Our investigators

555
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:54,150
已经有了几条线索
have several leads, and hopefully we'll--

556
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:57,100
一定尽力将凶手缉拿归案
we'll have a suspect for you in custody soon.

557
00:37:58,580 --> 00:37:59,840
这个行凶者
Now, this perpetrator

558
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,890
会被缉拿归案  他将感受到
will be apprehended, and he will know

559
00:38:02,890 --> 00:38:04,730
路易斯安那州警方的办事效率
swift Louisiana justice.

560
00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:07,350
查理
Charlie.

561
00:38:08,130 --> 00:38:10,350
说说你的前妻  朵拉·兰吧
Let's talk about your ex, Dora Lange.

562
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:12,090
你要谈谈朵拉
You want to talk Dori?

563
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:14,540
她又说我干什么了
What's she said I've done now?

564
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:17,780
没说什么  只是想问你
Nothing. We're just curious if you knew

565
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:20,340
知不知道她最近住哪  在干什么
what she's been up to and maybe where she's living.

566
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:21,340
不知道
Nope.

567
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:23,590
我坐了一年牢
Got her divorce papers pushed through

568
00:38:23,590 --> 00:38:25,080
她就提出离婚了
after I been here about a year.

569
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:27,470
我不怪她
I don't blame the bitch.

570
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:29,570
她有瘾吗
She got a habit?

571
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:32,660
有
Yeah, a few.

572
00:38:33,490 --> 00:38:35,800
大麻  冰毒  多巴胺
Weed, meth, juice.

573
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,030
多了
Name it.

574
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:38,650
查理
Charlie,

575
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:39,780
你在哪遇见她的
how'd y'all meet?

576
00:38:40,430 --> 00:38:42,820
一起长大  一起辍学
Growed up together, dropped out the same time.

577
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:44,550
进展的飞快
Hitched up way too quick.

578
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:48,790
我虽然想有个老婆  但也不希望她老管着我
You know how it is--you want a wife, but only half the time.

579
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:52,610
你怎么说她好久没联系你了
Why are you saying you hadn't heard from her?

580
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:56,060
前一阵子她还给你打过电话
She called up here for you not too long ago.

581
00:38:56,990 --> 00:38:58,000
她又帮不了我
She couldn't help me anyway, man.

582
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,240
一听就知道她糟透了
She sounded all fucked up.

583
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:02,040
查理  其实我们想知道的
You see, that's exactly the kind of thing

584
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:04,190
就是这种事
that we do want to know about, though, Charlie.

585
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:05,830
好吧
Oh. All right.

586
00:39:06,910 --> 00:39:08,930
我想从店里拿点货
Uh...I needed some scratch for my store,

587
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:12,150
朵拉欠我钱  她没电话
and Dori owes me money, she ain't got no fuckin' phone,

588
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:14,680
我就给她朋友卡拉打电话
so got a number to her friend Carla, got her

589
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:17,230
要她给我回电话  但她满嘴胡话
to call me back, and she ain't made no fuckin' sense.

590
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:20,790
卡拉的全名和电话号码
Carla's full name and phone number.

591
00:39:21,770 --> 00:39:23,360
满嘴胡话是什么意思
What you mean, she didn't make sense?

592
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,650
她说她能用耙子打鸭子
Like she could duck-hunt with a rake.

593
00:39:28,170 --> 00:39:29,170
嗑药了
High, yeah.

594
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:33,310
说要去当修女
Talkin' 'bout she's gonna become a nun.

595
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:36,380
-为什么当修女  -谁知道  她嗑药了
- Why a nun? - I don't know, man. She was high.

596
00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:38,760
一团糟
Fucked up, uh,

597
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:41,630
说她遇到了国王
talkin' 'bout... she met a king.

598
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,120
操
Shit.

599
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:44,790
那个
Anyway...

600
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:48,140
我可不想做告密者
I don't need no snitch jacket up in here.

601
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:50,380
得了吧
Give me a break.

602
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:53,010
这是阿沃伊斯
This is Avoyelles.

603
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:55,480
这就是小儿科
It's a goddamn day camp.

604
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:57,600
去安哥拉[非洲]试试
Spend some time in Angola.

605
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:01,260
你会惊讶这里还能有雅利安人
Surprised you even got Aryan Nation here.

606
00:40:03,990 --> 00:40:04,940
朵拉干什么了
What'd Dori do?

607
00:40:09,230 --> 00:40:10,350
她死了
Dori's dead.

608
00:40:12,630 --> 00:40:13,900
谢谢你们
Thank you, boys.

609
00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:16,580
我们刚才还挺开心的
We almost had a moment there.

610
00:40:31,210 --> 00:40:34,080
你是想全听一遍还是只听结果
So you want to talk the whole case through or just the end?

611
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:35,720
不介意的话
No, whole story

612
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:37,120
从你的角度全讲一遍吧
from your end, you don't mind.

613
00:40:37,210 --> 00:40:39,270
他也说了  文件都毁了
You know, like he said, files got ruined.

614
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:40,780
丽塔飓风
Hurricane Rita.

615
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:47,040
他没说的是这还跟其他事有关
What he didn't say is that this is about something else.

616
00:40:48,890 --> 00:40:51,440
是不是跟查尔斯湖有关的那个
Something new. That one in Lake Charles, maybe?

617
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:54,370
你为什么会这么说
Now, why you say that?

618
00:40:54,770 --> 00:40:56,740
报纸上读到的
Get the details out of the paper.

619
00:40:57,490 --> 00:40:58,610
是的
Yeah, we did.

620
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:02,080
查尔斯湖的事你都知道什么
You know anything about that, about Lake Charles?

621
00:41:03,770 --> 00:41:04,630
我看看
Well, let me see

622
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:07,430
你们知道什么  唤起一下我的记忆
what you got, jog my memory.

623
00:41:07,430 --> 00:41:08,940
先听你说
Well, let's hear your story first,

624
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:10,600
看和我们所掌握的有没有出入
see how it fit with what we got.

625
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,270
听你的  头儿
Well, your dime, boss.

626
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:19,200
说说科尔  你提到的
Talking Cohle, what about that dinner

627
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,400
那次晚餐  他饭前就醉了吗
you mentioned, he turn up drunk?

628
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:23,750
没错
Oh. Yeah.

629
00:41:25,990 --> 00:41:28,140
那顿饭是之后的事了
That dinner, that was a bit later.

630
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:30,990
有点搞笑
It was kind of funny.

631
00:41:30,990 --> 00:41:33,000
那些花
The flowers, you know?

632
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:34,950
他不知道在哪看的
Like, he read somewhere that

633
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:36,240
别人请吃饭
if you get invited to dinner,

634
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,210
你就应该带花
you're supposed to bring flowers?

635
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:41,030
怎么回事
The hell?

636
00:41:41,070 --> 00:41:43,300
你都站不稳了
You can barely stand up.

637
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:45,670
给个理由
What is it?

638
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:48,140
你不和我  不和兄弟们喝酒
You don't drink with me or the boys,

639
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,000
但你来我家之前
and you got to get a load on

640
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,790
却喝了个酩酊大醉
before you visit my family?

641
00:41:51,790 --> 00:41:53,430
不  小马  不是那样的
No, Marty, it's not like that.

642
00:41:55,590 --> 00:41:57,070
我不是故意的
And I didn't mean to,

643
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:58,160
好吗
all right?

644
00:42:00,650 --> 00:42:02,860
我不喝是因为我以前就有
And I don't drink 'cause I've had trouble

645
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:04,610
酗酒的毛病  我不是故意的
with it before, I didn't mean to.

646
00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:11,010
我在和线人接头
I was checking on a CI.

647
00:42:11,010 --> 00:42:12,970
然后就去酒吧喝了几杯
I ended up hanging around a bar.

648
00:42:16,330 --> 00:42:17,080
我坐在那里
I was sitting there.

649
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:19,370
想不出什么不喝的理由
I couldn't think of a good reason not to.

650
00:42:22,010 --> 00:42:23,300
平常我都不喝的
Usually I can.

651
00:42:29,830 --> 00:42:31,200
别担心
Don't worry about it.

652
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:34,250
多喝点咖啡
Have some more coffee

653
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:37,370
尽量聊上10分钟
and just try to make 10 minutes of conversation.

654
00:42:37,370 --> 00:42:38,250
知道了
You got it.

655
00:42:39,610 --> 00:42:41,520
我会给克里斯或是谁打电话
I'll call Chris or somebody,

656
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:43,780
把你接走
get you out of here.

657
00:42:46,110 --> 00:42:46,880
小马
Marty.

658
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:51,630
我很抱歉
I'm sorry, man.

659
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:54,140
没关系
Forget it.

660
00:42:55,690 --> 00:42:57,320
我们改天好了
We'll try this some other time.

661
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:12,600
拉斯特  很高兴终于能见到你了
Well, uh, Rust, it is so nice to finally meet you.

662
00:43:13,350 --> 00:43:14,700
抱歉这么久才见到你
Sorry it took so long.

663
00:43:15,690 --> 00:43:18,710
我试过告诉她你不擅长社交
Well, I tried to tell her you aren't big on socializing.

664
00:43:18,710 --> 00:43:20,090
我说过你的生命
I said that your life's

665
00:43:20,090 --> 00:43:21,750
掌握在这个人的手里  对吗
in this man's hands, right?

666
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:24,120
那就应该见见他的家人
Of course you should meet the family.

667
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:28,510
没那么戏剧化  宝贝
Well, not quite as dramatic as that, hon.

668
00:43:29,510 --> 00:43:30,900
我都没开过枪
I've never fired my gun.

669
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:33,030
你开过枪吗
Have you fired your gun?

670
00:43:33,030 --> 00:43:33,930
奥德丽
Audrey.

671
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:39,620
开过
Yes.

672
00:43:40,290 --> 00:43:41,650
你开枪打过人吗
You shot people?

673
00:43:41,650 --> 00:43:42,490
梅茜
Macie.

674
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:47,000
爸爸没朝任何人开过枪
Dad's never shot anybody.

675
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:48,980
那很好
Well, that's good.

676
00:43:50,350 --> 00:43:51,870
打人可不好玩
You don't want to shoot people.

677
00:43:52,150 --> 00:43:53,340
但你打过
But you have.

678
00:43:55,110 --> 00:43:56,720
小马说你来自德克萨斯
Marty says you're from Texas.

679
00:43:58,590 --> 00:43:59,890
是的  南德克萨斯
Yes, south Texas.

680
00:44:00,850 --> 00:44:03,430
我在阿拉斯加长大
I grew up in Alaska.

681
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:06,450
在这工作十来年了
Just been working here the last 10, 12 years.

682
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:07,440
是什么工作
What kind of work?

683
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:10,970
绝大部分时间是缉毒
Narcotics, mostly.

684
00:44:13,470 --> 00:44:16,730
1989年之前一直在休斯敦的劫案组
was on the Robbery Squad in Houston until '89.

685
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:19,380
我接个电话就回来
Oh. Be right back.

686
00:44:20,610 --> 00:44:21,810
你们继续吃
Y'all keep eating.

687
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:28,570
喜欢你的工作吗
Do you like your job?

688
00:44:33,070 --> 00:44:34,260
不怎么喜欢
Not exactly,

689
00:44:35,290 --> 00:44:36,610
但是很值得
but it's worthwhile.

690
00:44:37,210 --> 00:44:38,380
我也很擅长
I'm good at it.

691
00:44:39,770 --> 00:44:40,800
你没结婚吗
You're not married?

692
00:44:43,270 --> 00:44:44,300
结过一次
Once.

693
00:44:44,830 --> 00:44:46,830
然后就没有了
Uh, not anymore.

694
00:44:47,650 --> 00:44:49,380
结婚的时候你也酗酒吗
Did you do this while you were married?

695
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:51,400
克里斯
Hey, Chris.

696

702

703
00:45:18,250 --> 00:45:20,340
不久之后就离婚了

704

我很抱歉

705
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:28,920
克里斯·戴玛打电话找你
Chris Demma's on the phone for you.

706
00:45:28,930 --> 00:45:32,430
说是线人什么的事
Something about a CI or...

707
00:45:32,660 --> 00:45:34,340
电话在后面左手边

709

怎么了
What was that?

710
00:45:50,820 --> 00:45:52,320
你们都在聊什么呢
What were y'all talking about?

711
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:54,030
你的工作
Your job.

712
00:45:55,690 --> 00:45:57,310
你了解他吗  小马
What do you know about him, Marty?

713
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:02,380
了解的不多
Um, not a lot.

714
00:46:02,870 --> 00:46:05,000
他应该是个好警探
He could be a good detective.

715
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:08,070
他工作很努力  不过
He's running on this thing, but, uh...

716
00:46:09,140 --> 00:46:10,260
有点傲慢
uppity.

717
00:46:13,210 --> 00:46:14,310
怎么了
What?

718
00:46:15,730 --> 00:46:17,720
你有问过他的事吗
Have you ever asked him about himself?

719
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:20,610
宝贝  相信我
Baby, trust me.

720
00:46:20,810 --> 00:46:23,210
你不会想了解他的
You do not want to pick this man's brain.

721
00:46:28,930 --> 00:46:30,010
什么事
What was that?

722
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:32,800
线人有了点新消息
Oh, some details on the CI.

723

谢谢你的晚餐  玛姬
Thank you for dinner, Maggie.

724
00:46:39,860 --> 00:46:42,310
-色香味俱全  -十分荣幸
- This looks great. - My pleasure.

725
00:46:42,470 --> 00:46:44,190
我讨厌西兰花
I don't like that broccoli.

726
00:46:44,190 --> 00:46:45,610
注意礼貌
Mind your manners.

727
00:46:45,750 --> 00:46:49,010
那  你要走吗
So you, uh, need to go or what?

728
00:46:50,370 --> 00:46:52,580
不用  事情不急
No, it's nothing can't wait till tomorrow.

729
00:46:54,970 --> 00:46:58,870
拉斯特  你刚刚说到哪了
Rust, uh, what you were saying before?

730
00:47:02,110 --> 00:47:04,710
我们该找些好点的话题
Oh, we can find something nicer to talk about.

731
00:47:05,980 --> 00:47:08,380
小马  我在桌上看到了照片
Marty, I saw your table in there.

732
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:10,090
你会飞钓
You fly-fish?

733
00:47:11,090 --> 00:47:12,260
会一点
Little bit.

734
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:18,050
你和科尔是02年开始不和的
So you and Cohle went bad in '02, huh?

735
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:20,080
我听说
Heard about that.

736
00:47:20,310 --> 00:47:23,600
是  我们之间的事
Yeah, well...what happened between me and him

737
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:27,390
和朵拉·兰的案子无关
don't have nothing to do with Dora Lange.

738
00:47:28,970 --> 00:47:31,910
我和拉斯特·科尔搭档了七年
I worked with Rust Cohle for 7 years.

739
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:34,170
人是会变的
People change.

740
00:47:34,170 --> 00:47:36,120
关系自然也会
Relationships change.

741
00:47:37,530 --> 00:47:39,050
你们还联系吗
You stay in touch?

742
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:41,930
不联系
No.

743
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:45,420
我们都有
No, I haven't talked to Rust in...

744
00:47:46,820 --> 00:47:48,100
10年没联系了
10 years.

745
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:55,300
不管怎样
Look, however we...

746
00:47:56,090 --> 00:47:58,740
他是个好警探
he was a good detective,

747
00:47:59,350 --> 00:48:02,410
尽管我们分开的不怎么愉快
and it don't matter how he ended it. I mean...

748
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:06,430
我也得实事求是
I can say that because it's the truth,

749
00:48:07,190 --> 00:48:09,740
我也没耿耿于怀
and I don't hold grudges.

750
00:48:09,740 --> 00:48:14,520
因为记仇有害健康
I believe that's the shit that leads to cancer.

751
00:48:19,110 --> 00:48:21,270
我们怎么谈到晚餐了
But why am I talking about dinner?

752
00:48:21,270 --> 00:48:26,240
你们想了解兰的案子  可以
Y'all want to walk through the Lange case, fine.

753
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:32,390
扯这些无关的事干什么
This other stuff-- well, what's going on?

754
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:35,280
抱歉  只是听到些传闻
Sorry. We just heard some stories.

755
00:48:35,650 --> 00:48:37,000
私下说句  听说他
Well, personally, I heard he was

756
00:48:37,010 --> 00:48:39,270
是个办案好手  是吗
an ace case man, right?

757
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:41,440
能讲讲他的办案手法吗
I'd like to understand his process.

758
00:48:46,010 --> 00:48:47,380
办案手法
"His process."

759
00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:48,490
行
Sure.

760
00:48:50,250 --> 00:48:51,960
房主说她把屋子弄的一团糟
The other landlord says she trashed the place,

761
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:53,980
所以拒付她的定金
so she lost her deposit.

762
00:48:54,230 --> 00:48:55,930
她的邻居也都搬走了
And the neighbors check out.

763
00:48:56,450 --> 00:48:58,560
据几个还记得她的人说
Those that remember her said that she, uh,

764
00:48:58,910 --> 00:49:01,690
她一般凌晨才回来
used to come in early in the morning,

765
00:49:01,710 --> 00:49:03,520
多数情况她都不回来
if she came home at all.

766
00:49:07,210 --> 00:49:09,590
你们几个在酒吧查得不错啊
You guys canvass the bars pretty good today?

767
00:49:12,630 --> 00:49:14,430
去你的  科尔
You know, up your ass, Cohle.

768
00:49:14,430 --> 00:49:16,700
有本事自己跑腿去
Why don't you do your own fuckin' leg work,

769
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:18,310
怪胎
you rat fuck?

770
00:49:22,890 --> 00:49:24,550
你再说一遍  醉鬼
Say it again, rummy.

771
00:49:30,180 --> 00:49:31,950
给我听好
You know what, man?

772
00:49:32,430 --> 00:49:34,570
去你的
Fuck you,

773
00:49:34,870 --> 00:49:36,290
税务人
Tax Man.

774
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:42,440
你怎么搞的
What the fuck?

775
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:44,520
接着刚才的说
Back to point.

776
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:46,690
有三个同事认识她
Got 3 hits on working girls.

777
00:49:46,830 --> 00:49:49,700
当然关系都不亲近
No one close to her, naturally.

778
00:49:49,970 --> 00:49:52,680
有些人偶尔和她有接触
A few names recognized her as occasional.

779
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:54,580
比如被她骗点小钱什么的
Like she tricked now and then,

780
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:57,820
她在几个车站也弄过钱
show up at a couple of truck stops when she needed cash.

781
00:49:58,200 --> 00:49:59,910
你查到名字了  都叫什么
You got some names. Which ones?

782
00:49:59,910 --> 00:50:03,410
我的媒体联络人雷·方特诺特
I heard from my AP guy, Ray Fontenot.

783
00:50:03,470 --> 00:50:05,820
说她叔叔是丹尼·方特诺特

785
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:10,700
我看过他的比赛  很棒
Yeah, I watched him play. Great player.

786
00:50:10,700 --> 00:50:12,400
他就住附近
Well, he lives close by.

787
00:50:12,470 --> 00:50:14,660
谢了
Well, thanks, guys.

788
00:50:15,310 --> 00:50:17,530
你们俩呢  有什么进展吗
What about you two? Did you get anything today?

789
00:50:17,530 --> 00:50:20,070
还没  长官
Not much, sir. Well...

790
00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:23,270
你们听说过塔特尔牧师吧
You might know the Reverend Tuttle.

791
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:25,460
市内公益活动负责人
He runs our state-wide charity drive.

792
00:50:25,470 --> 00:50:27,490
这两位是哈特探员  科尔探员

很高兴见到你们  警官
Pleasure to meet you, officers.

794
00:50:29,130 --> 00:50:30,370
很高心见到你  我是科尔
Nice to meet you. Cohle.

795
00:50:30,370 --> 00:50:33,450
你们的案子已受到广泛关注
Your case has a lot of people taking care,

796
00:50:33,450 --> 00:50:36,190
夜不闭户的地方现在也人心惶惶
doors locking where they used to not.

797
00:50:36,390 --> 00:50:38,290
埃迪跟我提过几次了
Eddie's been speaking to me about it.

798
00:50:38,290 --> 00:50:40,450
他很关心此案的进展
Concerned, very concerned.

799
00:50:40,450 --> 00:50:42,770
我们在考虑成立一个特别小组
We've been discussing the viability of a task force

800
00:50:42,770 --> 00:50:45,480
专门调查反基督徒犯罪
to investigate crimes with an anti-Christian connotation.

801
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:48,100
什么  开玩笑吗
You what? Really?

802
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:52,000
是
Yes.

803
00:50:55,030 --> 00:50:58,620
我也不想把你们的处境公之于众
I don't mean to tell men of your positions,

804
00:50:58,620 --> 00:51:02,350
但是此事绝不单纯
but there is a war happening behind things.

805
00:51:04,750 --> 00:51:06,420
工作辛苦了
Thank you for doing your part.

806
00:51:06,430 --> 00:51:08,460

808
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:17,490
埃迪会很高兴的
to have such good men working on this.

809
00:51:21,990 --> 00:51:23,380
你怎么回事
Are you kidding me?

810
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:25,630
真他妈难以置信
Un-fuckin'-believable.

811
00:51:26,030 --> 00:51:28,060
反基督徒
"Anti-Christian."

812
00:51:28,060 --> 00:51:31,440
去他的  艾迪又是谁
Fucks. And who the fuck's Eddie?

813
00:51:33,950 --> 00:51:35,160
他真不知道
Is he serious?

814
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:37,500
他不看电视的
Well, he doesn't have a television.

815
00:51:37,510 --> 00:51:39,460
-艾迪是谁  -他从德州来的
- Who's Eddie? - And he's from Texas.

816
00:51:39,460 --> 00:51:41,430
他是那操蛋州长
He's the fuckin' governor--

817
00:51:41,430 --> 00:51:43,290
埃德温·塔特尔
Edwin Tuttle.

818
00:51:43,290 --> 00:51:44,960
他们是堂兄弟
They're first cousins.

819
00:51:45,780 --> 00:51:47,050
那就说得通了
Well, that makes sense.

820
00:51:47,050 --> 00:51:49,050
那可是大人物的声音
Yeah, that's the sound of The Big Machine,

821
00:51:49,050 --> 00:51:51,920
科尔  他们准备着揍你一顿呢
Cohle, that's gearing up to pound your ass.

822
00:51:52,380 --> 00:51:54,460
是一群母鸡的声音吧
The sound of a gaggle of hens.

823
00:51:54,460 --> 00:51:56,360
你最好说话注意点
Yeah, you better watch your mouth

824
00:51:56,370 --> 00:51:58,670
小心它们把你眼睛啄出来
or they're gonna peck your eyes out.

825
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:04,300
我来找哈特警探
I am looking for Detective Hart.

826
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:05,950
我有一沓证词要给他
I have a stack of depositions for him.

827
00:52:05,950 --> 00:52:07,600
萨德本法官叮嘱我一定要把东西
Judge Sutpen told me to make sure and give them

828
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:09,830
交到哈特警探本人手里
to Detective Hart and no one else, so...

829
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:11,720
那是
Oh. Is that the, um--

830
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:13,080
证词
The, uh, depositions.

831
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:15,060
我想我该给你详细解释下
I thought I should walk you through them.

832
00:52:15,060 --> 00:52:18,240
好的  好的  咱们找个地方说吧
Oh. Great, great. Let's just find a place to talk.

833
00:52:18,570 --> 00:52:19,730
多谢  凯思琳

835
00:52:21,370 --> 00:52:22,940
到后面来
Right through here.

836
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,750
死者是朵拉·兰
Your victim was Dora Lange,

837
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:55,370
但你们都在调查玛丽·方特诺特
but you all checked on Marie Fontenot.

838
00:52:55,370 --> 00:52:56,530
为什么
Why?

839
00:52:57,240 --> 00:52:58,810
失踪五年的女孩
Missing girl, 5 years gone,

840
00:52:58,810 --> 00:53:00,240
错报
report made in error?

841
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:03,130
她有个叔叔  住在附近
She had an uncle who lived nearby...

842
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:06,510
这是直觉
and call it intuition.

843
00:53:09,370 --> 00:53:11,890
有时候他反应会比较多
Sometimes he's more responsive.

844
00:53:11,990 --> 00:53:13,550
我可以帮你们
I'd like to help.

845
00:53:19,970 --> 00:53:21,500
方特诺特先生
Mr. Fontenot.

846
00:53:28,390 --> 00:53:29,570
我们见过
We met,

847
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:32,790
大概七年前
oh, maybe 7 years ago.

848
00:53:32,990 --> 00:53:34,820
当时我在访问斯基普·海斯
I was visiting Skip Hays.

849
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:36,740
{\an8}路易斯安那州

850
00:53:34,820 --> 00:53:36,960
我以前在足球联盟踢球
I'd played for USL.

851
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:41,170
看你投球真是一件美事  先生
Thing of beauty, sir, watching you throw.

852
00:53:42,490 --> 00:53:45,000
丹尼  他是名警探
Danny, this man's a detective

853
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,370
与警方合作的
with the police.

854
00:53:54,340 --> 00:53:57,040
实际上...抱歉
I'm actually-- Sorry, uh,

855
00:53:57,580 --> 00:54:00,630
我们想问问你的侄女玛丽的事
we wanted to ask you about your niece, Marie.

856
00:54:02,090 --> 00:54:05,450
“你要让一个家庭承受多少痛苦”  我问主
"How much could you put on one family?" I ask the Lord.

857
00:54:05,930 --> 00:54:07,470
我们想过下去
We try to get by.

858
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:10,810
你认识玛丽的生父吗
Did you know Marie's birth father?

859
00:54:10,810 --> 00:54:11,900
伦恩
Len?

860
00:54:12,490 --> 00:54:14,370
她爸爸是伦恩·斯特劳斯
Len Stroghes was her daddy.

861
00:54:16,110 --> 00:54:17,170
没事的
It's OK.

862
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:19,700
我们问是因为
We're asking because, uh,

863
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:22,430
我们听说玛丽和他远走高飞了
we had heard that Marie ran off with him

864
00:54:22,430 --> 00:54:26,040
并不是真的失踪
and that...she wasn't really missing.

865
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:30,350
是黛比说的吧
That's what Debbie said.

866
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:34,530
有伦恩的消息吗
Oh. Well, uh... anybody heard from Len?

867
00:54:34,530 --> 00:54:38,260
有人知道他在哪儿吗
Anybody maybe knows where he's at?

868
00:54:42,570 --> 00:54:45,080
抱歉  最后一件事
Uh, sorry. The last thing.

869
00:54:45,270 --> 00:54:46,980
你知道黛比现在在哪儿吗
Do you know where Debbie is now?

870
00:54:46,980 --> 00:54:48,590
她嫁给别人了
She married another man.

871
00:54:48,590 --> 00:54:51,530
不是玛丽还在时的那个人
Not the one she's with when Marie...

872
00:54:52,530 --> 00:54:55,010
最近一次听说她的消息是她在拉斯维加斯
She was in Vegas, last we heard.

873
00:55:18,510 --> 00:55:20,410
玛丽一定很喜欢这里
Marie must have loved it here.

874
00:55:20,530 --> 00:55:21,650
是的
Yeah.

875
00:55:22,020 --> 00:55:23,520
这些都是她的吗
All this for her?

876
00:55:23,710 --> 00:55:25,820
丹尼非常爱她
Danny loved her so much.

877
00:55:26,430 --> 00:55:27,990
虽然我们不是她的法定监护人
We weren't her legal guardians,

878
00:55:27,990 --> 00:55:30,300
但她跟我们在一起的时间
but she played here all the time,

879
00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:32,090
比跟她妈妈的还多
more than her Mama's.

880
00:55:32,260 --> 00:55:33,490
我能看出来原因
I can see why.

881
00:55:35,020 --> 00:55:38,170
如果你不介意的话  丹得的是什么病
What is it Dan has, if you don't mind my asking?

882
00:55:38,830 --> 00:55:42,220
他们只说是"脑部的问题"
All they ever told us was "a cerebral event."

883
00:55:42,710 --> 00:55:44,750
类似连续中风
Series of strokes, like.

884
00:55:52,980 --> 00:55:54,090
小马
Marty?

885
00:55:57,050 --> 00:55:58,880
失陪一下
Excuse me for one sec.

886
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,190
屋里地板右边
Inside on the floor on the right.

887
00:56:32,170 --> 00:56:33,690
我不知道那是什么
I don't know what that is.

888
00:56:33,690 --> 00:56:36,860
从警察第一次来过后我就没去过那里
I haven't looked in there since the police first came.

889
00:56:42,700 --> 00:56:44,760
{\an8}证物

890
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:47,400
你肯定想听最精彩的部分吧
Bet you want to hear the hero shot, huh?

891
00:56:48,820 --> 00:56:52,090
我们救出孩子的地方
That place we carried the kids out?

892
00:56:52,090 --> 00:56:53,720
最后会问到的  没错
Eventually, sure.

893
00:56:56,750 --> 00:56:58,460
她长什么样
So what did she look like...

894
00:56:59,660 --> 00:57:01,530
查尔斯湖的那个人
that one in Lake Charles?

895
00:57:26,850 --> 00:57:28,930
你能  看出
Can you, uh, tell us

896
00:57:28,930 --> 00:57:31,160
任何线索吗  科尔先生
anything about that, Mr. Cohle?

897
00:57:35,470 --> 00:57:38,540
这尸体和95年的那具非常像
That looks a lot like the one from '95,

898
00:57:39,420 --> 00:57:41,160
不过  你们早就知道了
but...well, you knew that already.

899
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:45,370
是的  具体内容和95年的案子一致
Yeah, there are specifics consistent to the '95 case,

900
00:57:45,370 --> 00:57:47,530
没有公之于众的细节
details that weren't public knowledge.

901
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:51,730
你消失了八年  对吗
You were off the grid for 8 years, right?

902
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:54,990
-2010年又出现在这里  -我的问题是
- Show back up here 2010. - My question is--

903
00:57:54,990 --> 00:57:56,920
怎么会是他...
How could it be him...

904
00:57:59,730 --> 00:58:02,510
如果我们95年已经抓到了他
if we already caught him in '95?

905
00:58:05,180 --> 00:58:07,450
确实  怎么会呢  警探们
How, indeed, Detectives?

906
00:58:08,620 --> 00:58:10,630
我觉得你知道
I figured you'd be the one to know.

907
00:58:19,650 --> 00:58:22,500
那就别他妈问这些没用的问题
Then start asking the right fuckin' questions.
