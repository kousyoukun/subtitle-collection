{\an8}真探
前情提要

2
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:04,170
你是想全听一遍还是...
So you want to talk the whole case through or...?

3
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:06,150
从你的角度全讲一遍吧
The whole story from your end, you don't mind.

你们就想听这个  是吗
That's what y'all want to hear about, right,

5
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:10,740
朵拉·兰  树林里的孩子们
Dora Lange, kids in the woods?

6

我保证这不是他第一次犯案
I guarantee this wasn't his first.

7
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,610
就是说  她被人下药  折磨  还摆成了那种姿势
So she was drugged, tortured, posed out there.

8
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:18,970
名叫方特诺特的姑娘吗
Is it the Fontenot girl?

9
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:20,130
你为什么要问这个
And why would you ask that?

10
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:21,780
那女孩前些年失踪了
Went missing around here years back.

11
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:24,710
十岁女孩失踪  没闹得全州沸沸扬扬吗
Ten-year-old girl goes missing and that doesn't go state-wide?

12
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:27,240
据我所知  这女孩跟他生父断绝了关系
My understanding, the little girl went off with her birth daddy.

13
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:28,390
小马

14
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,970
我不知道那是什么

15
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:32,670
从警察第一次来过后我就没去过那里
I haven't looked in there since the police first came.

16
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:35,570
拉斯特  很高兴终于能见到你了

17
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:37,870
-有几个孩子  -一个  她夭折了

18
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:39,530
不久之后就离婚了
Marriage didn't last long after that.

19
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:40,600
这是塔特尔牧师吧
This is Reverend Tuttle.

20
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,100
我们在考虑成立一个特别小组

21
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:44,720
专门调查反基督徒犯罪

22
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,500
但是此事绝不单纯
There is a war happening.

23
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:47,560
你要谈谈朵拉
You want to talk Dori?

24
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:48,400

25
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,110
说她遇到了国王
Talkin' 'bout she met a king.

26
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:51,820
你能看出任何线索吗
Can you, uh, tell us anything about that?

27
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:52,770
你消失了
You were off the grid.

28
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:53,670
我的问题是
My question is--

29
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:55,260
怎么会是他...
How could it be him...

30
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,680
如果我们95年已经抓到了他
if we already caught him in '95?

31
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,650
确实  怎么会呢  警探们
How indeed, Detectives?

32

那会  我想睡觉

却睡不着  一直在想女人
I'd lay awake thinking about women.

35
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:44,350
我女儿...我妻子
My daughter... my wife.

36
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:48,790
好像她们身上刻着我的名字
I mean, it's like... something's just got your name on it,

37
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:50,230
就像一颗子弹
like a, like a bullet

38
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:53,240
或者马路上的一颗钉子
or a nail in the road.

39
00:02:57,770 --> 00:02:58,400
妈的
Shit.

40
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,900
不好意思  扯远了
Sorry. I drift...

41
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:04,060
我喝点酒之后老爱瞎扯
sometimes when I've had a few. That's...

42
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:06,920
所以我才喜欢一个人喝酒
That's why I like to drink alone.

43
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:08,970
至少是原因之一吧
One reason, anyway.

44
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:11,760
关于王冠的事
About that sculpture thing.

45
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,060
数年后  就这样出现有点奇怪
Kind of strange it turns up like that years later.

46
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,700
对  没人知道那玩意为什么出现在玩具房
Yeah, nobody knew why that thing was in the playhouse.

47
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:30,590
{\an8}证据

48

但我看  像是有人
To me, it was like someone was

51
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:39,020
想表达什么
having a conversation, you know?

52
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:48,350
92年  那女孩的学校关闭了
Girl's... school shut down in '92.

安德鲁事件之后就关闭了
It closed down after Andrew.

54
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:53,870
这对你们有用吗
That mean anything to you?

55
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:03,690
我们通知了死者的母亲
Oh, we notified the deceased's mother.

56

你还记得上次见到

朵拉的情形吗

58
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,700
那太恐怖了  太恐怖了
It was a horrible, horrible thing.

59

我们在电视上看到了

60
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:21,520
我们为之祷告
what we're in the clutches of,

61
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:25,490
我还为她的家人祈祷
and I prayed and prayed for that woman's family.

62
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,720

为什么这么问  你们听说了什么
Why? What have you heard?

68

我听说他过世了  对吗
I heard he passed. Is that correct?

69
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:47,460
为什么父亲不给自己的孩子洗澡
Why wouldn't a father bathe his own child?

70
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:56,690
我们只是想知道
We, uh, we were just wondering

71

00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,630
她听上去很伤心  小马
She sounds sad, Marty,

143
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:32,640
像个垂死之人
like a torn-up person on her last legs.

144
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:37,590
这种姑娘最容易下手
She was just an easy target for him.

145
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:40,870
我们对他了解多少
What do we know about him?

146
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:43,400
袭击妓女  有艺术细胞
Hits prosts, artistic,

147
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,920
有某种宗教信仰
religious in some kind of way.

148
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,340
这方圆几千里
Every person within a thousand miles of here

149
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:51,430
也就你没有信仰了吧
is religious in some kind of way, except you.

150
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:53,580
有几个尸体能有鹿角
How many DBs have antlers,

151
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,590
蒙着眼睛
blindfolds,

152
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:58,270
背上画着符号
painted symbols on their back, hmm?

153
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:00,560
瘾君子嗑药了什么都敢干
Yeah, you know what tweakers get up to.

154
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,650
该死  新奥尔良有个哥们
Shit, man, this dude in New Orleans

155
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:04,870
把他女朋友分尸  突然后悔了
cut up his girl, felt remorse,

156
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:07,100
就又用万能胶粘起来了
tried to piece her back together with Krazy Glue.

157
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:09,080
这是药物性精神失常
That's just drug insanity.

158
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,430
这不一样  这有针对性
Ah, that's not this. This has scope.

159
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,840
她被装扮成了杀手所看到的异象
Now, she articulated a person with vision.

160
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:17,600
异象有其意义  意义又有史可稽
Vision is meaning. Meaning is historical.

161
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:21,120
她本人根本不重要
Look, she was just chum in the water, man.

162
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:38,320
毫无收获的一天
Days of nothing.

163
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,200
办案的日子就这样
That's what it's like, you work cases.

164
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,540
迷途的羔羊一样
Days like lost dogs.

165
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:57,610
日子一直那样
Goes on like that.

166
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:00,120
这工作就那样
You know the job.

167
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:03,880
探索案件背后的故事
You're looking for narrative,

168
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:07,050
审问目击者
interrogate witnesses.

169
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:09,060
起床了  爸爸
Wake up, Daddy.

170
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:10,690
用各种残缺的证据
Parcel evidence,

171
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:12,890
建立时间线
establish a timeline,

172
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:17,610
一点一点  编出一个故事来
and build a story day after day.

173
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,050
不  不
No! No!

174
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,470
那天晚上
Hey, the other night,

175
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:40,450
你来吃晚饭
when you were over for dinner,

176
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,680
克里斯打来电话之后  你为什么没走
why didn't you leave when I had Chris call?

177
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:51,310
我不知道
Mmm, I don't know.

178
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:53,490
可能我稍微清醒一点了
I guess I had sobered up a little.

179
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:58,960
另外  那也没我想的那么糟
Besides, it wasn't as bad as I thought.

180
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:01,400
和你的家人在一起
And being around your family,

181
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,560
我喜欢和她们聊天
I liked talking to them.

182
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:07,090
"糟"  你怎么会这么觉得
"Bad"? Why'd you think that?

183
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:13,220
我结过婚  小马  结婚三年
I was married, Marty, for 3 years.

184
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:16,400
我们有一个...  女儿
We had a... baby girl.

185
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,650
夭折了
She died.

186
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:21,100
车祸  她那时两岁
Car accident. She was two years old.

187
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:24,310
我们的婚姻太脆弱
Marriage couldn't handle it.

188
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:28,380
你女儿夭折了
Your kid died?

189
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:33,860
我...
Oh, I...

190
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:38,580
抱歉  伙计  很抱歉  我不知...
I'm sorry, man. I am so sorry. I didn't--

191
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:41,670
别这样  不是你们的错  问题在于我
No, I mean, it wasn't you guys. It was just me.

192
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:45,430
我担心...
I was worried...

193
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:48,940
就是  接触家庭什么的
you know, being around that kind of thing.

194
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:52,880
你结过婚吧  就一次
Hey, you were married the once, just the once?

195
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,980
嗯  还有次差点成了
Uh-huh. Came close another time.

196
00:11:58,380 --> 00:11:59,560
和劳瑞
Laurie.

197
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,840
玛姬介绍的
Maggie introduced us,

198
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:08,160
后来分了
and it-- it broke off.

199
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:11,090
这样也好  我不怪她
It was for the best, you know. I gave her cause.

200
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,460
和我生活不容易
I can be hard to live with. You know, I...

201
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:21,030
我总是会不自觉地批评别人
I don't mean to, but I can be... critical.

202
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:24,900
有时我觉得我就适合独居
And sometimes I think I'm just not good for people,

203
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:29,130
这是为了我身边的人好
you know, that it's not good for them to be around me.

204
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:32,640
我  总让他们劳神费心
You know, I... I wear 'em down,

205
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,150
他们就
you know, they...

206
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,570
会不高兴
they get unhappy.

207
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:42,310
许多干警察的都这样
Yeah, I think the job does that to a lot of guys.

208
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:46,530
职业改变性格  有些人注意到了  仅此而已
Changes you. Some guys just notice, that's all.

209
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,250
我应该不是干了警察才这样
Well I can't say the job made me this way.

210
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:53,090
而是这性格让我适合干警察
More like me being this way made me right for the job.

211
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:55,220
过去我还
And I used to...

212
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:58,290
常常思考这事
think about it more, but...

213
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:02,360
但是到了一定的年龄  你自然就了解自己了
you know, you reach a certain age, you know who you are.

214
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:07,220
现在我住在城外
Now I live in a little room

215
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:09,610
乡间酒吧后的一间小屋里
out in the country, behind a bar.

216
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:13,480
每周工作四晚  没事喝喝酒
Work 4 nights a week; in between, I drink,

217
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:17,040
也没人管我
and there ain't nobody there to stop me.

218
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,870
这才是我
I know who I am.

219
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,580
这么多年
After all these years, there's a...

220
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:30,090
我才终于明白此事
there's a victory in that.

221
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,060
上班第三天
Third day on the job,

222
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:37,350
我拦下了一个超速的美女
stopped this cutie for speeding.

223
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:40,200
52分钟后  我和她就在她宿舍了
52 minutes later, back in her dorm room.

224
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,590
制服
I got my...

225
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:44,800
脱到了膝盖那里
uniform around my knees.

226
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:47,840
我正忙着呢
I'm occupied,

227
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:50,900
什么也听不到
So I don't hear anything.

228
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:54,800
我都不知道她室友回来了
I don't know that her roommate has come home

229
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,190
-偷偷溜到我们身后  -糟糕
- and snuck up behind us. - Oh, shit.

230
00:13:57,190 --> 00:13:59,950
你知道我怎么发现她回来了吗
You know how I knew that she was in the room?

231
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:03,210
她拿手指爆了我的菊花
She stuck her finger up my ass!

232
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:08,940
害惨我了  现在不这样都不爽
Ruined me. Now I can't do without it.

233
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:14,490
这职业也有让人怀念的地方
You miss some things on the job.

234
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:15,910
你懂的
You know what I mean.

235
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:19,190
安心过日子之前
You got to... decompress

236
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:23,090
总得先给自己缓解压力
before you can go being a family man.

237
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,950
当你投入工作时
What you get into working,

238
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:28,340
就没法兼顾孩子
you can't have the kids around that.

239
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:34,980
有时需要整理思绪
So, um, sometimes you got to get your head right.

240
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:37,000
能去你那吗
Mind if I stop by?

241
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:39,400
那取决于你在哪
I don't know. Where are you?

242
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:40,870
艾尔克斯
Elks.

243
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:42,740
那你肯定醉了
So you're drunk.

244
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:44,380
我没醉
No, I'm not,

245
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:47,200
我都没怎么喝
and I've hardly had anything to drink.

246
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,860
你老是没怎么喝
You never hardly have anything to drink.

247
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:54,260
我有惊喜给你
I have a surprise for you.

248
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:56,010
真的吗
Oh, yeah?

249
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,900
那你是同意了
Is that a yes?

250
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:02,090
考虑考虑
I, uh, might stay up.

251
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:10,640
解压对妻子孩子也是好事
It's for your wife and kids, too.

252
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:15,230
有机会就抓住  赶紧放松
You got to take your release where you find it

253
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:17,080
有时机会还会送上门
or where it finds you.

254
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:21,290
这对家庭是有好处的
I mean, in the end, it's for the good of the family.

255
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:42,930
那是什么
What's that?

256
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:45,440
是  我
Oh, well, I, uh,

257
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,880
给你的礼物
got you a present.

258
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:07,420
不要动
Don't move a muscle.

259
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:10,080
不动  除了指头
I shan't. Just the fingers,

260
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:12,870
只有指头
the finger muscles.

261
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,300
停下
Oh, stop.

262
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:21,400
你真不乖
Oh, you're very naughty.

263
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:31,760
你有权保持沉默
You have the right to remain silent.

264
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:34,460
你所说的任何话
Anything you say

265
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:37,760
都将作为呈堂证供
can and will be held against you in a court of law.

266
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:39,920
你有权聘请律师
You have the right to an attorney.

267
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,700
如果你负担不起
If you can't afford an attorney,

268
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:45,050
政府将为你指派
the state will provide you one.

269
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:48,240
明白你的权利了吗
Do you understand your rights?

270
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:52,490
你都能直接进司法部了
You definitely have a career in law enforcement.

271
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:57,750
我本来打算给你用的
Well, I thought I was gonna put these on you.

272
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:59,950
想要吗
You want this?

273
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:02,870
真的想要
You want it?

274
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,780
能再解释一下吗
Now, what do you mean,

275
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,860
你提到的异象
exactly, these visions you mentioned?

276
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:08,190
我以为你知道呢
Oh, shit. I thought you knew.

277
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:10,970
其实我都告诉过小马了
I told Marty about them, you know, down the line.

278
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:21,370
就是记忆闪回
Uh, chemical... flashbacks,

279
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:23,960
精神创伤那些
neural damage, you know,

280
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:26,640
我在HIDTA时留下的
from my time in the HIDTA,

281
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:30,640
就是大规模贩毒区
as in High-Intensity Drug Trafficking Area.

282
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:47,270
我当过4年的卧底
I spent 4 years undercover.

283
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:49,750
懂吗
You know what that means?

284
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:55,800
所以才有了我刚来时的那些流言
That's where they got them Fed rumors, I first come in.

285
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:00,190
什么  你们俩不知道吗
What, you two don't know about them?

286
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:05,340
那些文件还封存着是吗
Those files are still sealed, huh?

287
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:08,810
可恶
Shee-it.

288
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:13,290
你们俩知道我的什么
Just what have you two heard about me?

289
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:47,440
你想要蓝色小药丸吗
You wanted blues?

290
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,620
安眠酮
Quaaludes.

291
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:51,980
-镇定剂吗  -是让人变迟钝的东西
- Downers? - Dopey stuff.

292
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:54,650
价格是多少
What's it run?

293
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:58,360
蓝色小药丸一片三元
I'm thinking blue go for three a pill.

294
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:02,220
给你200元  我要一瓶
We'll say 200 for the bottle.

295
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,520
我猜到你也许会全都要
I thought you might just take 'em.

296
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,710
或许你想要别的什么
Or that you wanted somethin' else.

297
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:21,470
别的某件事
Some kind of somethin' else?

298
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:27,370
不
No.

299
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:34,490
我在想什么呢  你这么帅
Then I was thinking, you're a good-looking man.

300
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:37,260
不需要靠勒索就有人愿意跟你干
You wouldn't need a shakedown to get some.

301
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:42,640
有没有客人比较粗暴或者让人害怕的
What about rough trade, scary guys?

302
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,850
你们女孩子之间应该会聊的
You girls talk.

303
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:46,590
在这里的人  要么很粗鲁
Around here, they're rough

304
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:48,130
要么喝了酒就不是人
or whiskey-limp.

305
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:50,650
见过很多人被激怒
Seen plenty of guys that get touchy.

306
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:52,260
某件事刺痛了他们
Something sets them off

307
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:54,210
他们就会像小孩子那样冲动
and they're like little boys.

308
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,290
人们通常会转身离开
People always go away around here.

309
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:00,090
我应该去哪里找
Where would I look,

310
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:04,360
可能认识那个金发女孩的人
working girls might know the blonde?

311
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:07,590
如果她在I-10高速公路南边干过
If she was gaming I-10 south side,

312
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,780
我知道这个地方
I heard of this place.

313
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,500
是个活动住房区一类的地方
Kind of trailer park.

314
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:13,660
女孩们会留下工作
Girls work and stay.

315
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:15,650
她们管那里叫大农场
They call it "The Ranch."

316
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:16,650
在哪里
Where's that?

317
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:20,460
好像在  西班牙湖的南边  应该是
Like, south of Spanish Lake, supposed to be.

318
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:23,430
你知道那个地方吗
You know the place?

319
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:29,120
你的工作是什么
What's your deal?

320
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:34,470
我没什么条件
I don't have a deal.

321
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:37,020
我的意思是  你是干什么的
I mean, what do you do?

322
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:42,420
别在意  我以为你会逮捕我
Never mind. I thought you were gonna bust me.

323
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:45,530
我跟你说过了  我没兴趣
I told you, I'm not interested.

324
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:46,950
是的  我知道
Yeah, I know.

325
00:21:48,810 --> 00:21:52,760
有点奇怪  就像你是个危险的人
Kinda strange, like you might be dangerous.

326
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,500
我当然是个危险的人
Well, of course I'm dangerous.

327
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:56,650
我是警察
I'm police.

328
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:59,430
我可能会对人做很可怕的事
I could do terrible things to people...

329
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:02,530
而且还能不受惩罚
with impunity.

330
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,830
你昨晚干什么去了
You know, what'd you do last night?

331
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:07,280
我晚上过来来着
I called up here late.

332
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:10,100
你在做什么
What were you doing?

333
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:11,030
干活
Working.

334
00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:14,520
只是想顺路来看看
Was thinking about dropping by.

335
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:16,140
你去哪里了
Where were you?

336
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:18,330
我和女朋友们出去玩
I was out with girlfriends.

337
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,750
我不喜欢这个答案
Uh-huh. Well, I don't like that.

338
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,670
怎么  你嫉妒了吗
What, you're jealous?

339
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:27,790
别傻了
Don't be stupid.

340
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:32,590
我是想说外面有个疯子
I just mean that there's a crazy man out there,

341
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:35,740
他专门杀害女性
and he's killing women.

342
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:38,540
又是那个女孩吗  那个撒旦印记
Wait, you mean that girl again, that Satanic thing?

343
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:41,730
法庭里每个人都在说那件事
Everyone's still talking about that at the courthouse.

344
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,060
不只是她
It's not just her.

345
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:46,740
有更多受害者
There's more.

346
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,690
还有别的受害者  真的吗
There's more? Really?

347
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:52,510
是的  我们没对其他人说
Yeah, well, we're not saying,

348
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:55,270
也没向媒体透露  但是
keeping it out of the press, but...

349
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:59,430
我们认为他多次作案
we're thinking that he's been doing this a while.

350
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:06,890
是的  暂时别出去了
Yeah, so no need to go out.

351
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:09,590
你就在这里喝吧
You just have a drink here.

352
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:12,990
我不能在家里和好男人约会
I can't meet a nice man at home.

353
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:19,200
你用那种
That hurts me

354
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:23,030
消极攻击的方式说话是对我的伤害
when you speak to me in a passive-aggressive way.

355
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:25,770
我对你都是有话就直说
I always talk straight to you.

356
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:28,890
抱歉  我的意思是你已经结婚了
Excuse me. I meant that since you're married,

357
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:30,060
作为一个年轻的女人
I need to be considering

358
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:31,610
我需要重新考虑我的选择了
my options as a young woman.

359
00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:34,270
我想要很多东西  小马
I want things, Marty.

360
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:40,040
我也一样
I want things, too.

361
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,630
没错  你想要你的蛋糕
Yeah, you just want your cake

362
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:44,080
还要吃掉它
and to eat it, too.

363
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:49,640
如果不能吃
How good is cake

364
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:51,490
那蛋糕再美味又有什么意义
if you can't eat it?

365
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:05,320
早安
Morning.

366
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,600
我想我可能发现了好东西
Hey, I think I might have found something good.

367
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:11,160
小兔山庄往南
Bunny ranch down south,

368
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:12,990
西班牙湖附近
round Spanish Lake.

369
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:17,090
今天不是该找老约翰吗
I thought we were pulling old Johns today.

370
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:19,070
我们应该先做这件事
Yeah, we should do this first.

371
00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:24,310
怎么了
What?

372
00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:27,170
你去洗洗  你身上有股骚味儿
You wash up. You got some pussy on you.

373
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:33,060
这是健康婚姻的关键
Key to a healthy marriage.

374
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:35,170
那是玛姬的吗
Oh, that's Maggie, huh?

375
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,870
你那该死的鼻子又欠打了吗
What's with your fucking nose?

376
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,850
没什么伙计  抱歉  忘记我说的话吧
Nothing, man. Sorry. Forget it.

377
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:49,580
我觉得你是在暗示
I get a connotation being implied here

378
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,790
我老婆什么
about my wife?

379
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,180
你是想说你带进来的骚味
Are you saying that's wife,

380
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:56,020
是你老婆的吗
that high tide you're walking in with?

381
00:24:57,210 --> 00:24:58,190
你知道
You got some idea

382
00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:00,910
我老婆的小穴闻起来是什么味儿吗
how my wife's pussy's supposed to smell?

383
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:03,170
不知道  我的意思是你
No, I just meant you're

384
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:05,950
穿着和昨天一样的衣服
wearing the same clothes as you did yesterday,

385
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:08,850
再加上我又不傻
coupled with the fact that I ain't stupid.

386
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,060
并不是要对这气味
Wasn't making no comment as to the...

387
00:25:12,810 --> 00:25:14,890
做任何评论
particularity of the scent.

388
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:20,200
你他妈的别提我老婆
You don't say fuck-all about my wife.

389
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:22,360
别提她的名字
Don't say her name.

390
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:27,610
你瞧不上你自己  那无所谓
You got some self-loathing to do this morning, that's fine,

391
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:31,340
但是不值得把你的手给搭进去
but it ain't worth losing your hands over.

392
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:33,580
你想怎么做啊
How would that work, exactly?

393
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:37,360
我只需要再多施加点压力
Well, I'd just apply a couple pounds of pressure,

394
00:25:39,650 --> 00:25:41,290
就能折断你的手腕
snap your wrists.

395
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,240
你是高级警探
You're Senior Detective.

396
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:47,800
认为我在虚张声势
Think I'm lying?

397
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:34,200
你是有这地方的具体地址
You got a specific location for this place

398
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:37,530
还是我们要瞎逛直到找到它
or are we just gonna wander around till we find it?

399
00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:39,450
我们手里有些人名
We got some names.

400
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:42,030
我得向他们问问路
I'm gonna have to ask for directions.

401
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:48,250
或许你闻着味找也行
Maybe you could just follow your nose.

402
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:53,440
不论他在哪儿找到他们的
Wherever he picked them up,

403
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:56,460
我不会撒谎的
I mean, I won't lie.

404
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:57,950
不管最后怎么样
However we left it,

405
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:00,200
他总能做到些什么
he had some moves.

406
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:05,680
他以前缉毒的时候认识了几个线人
He knew a few CIs from his narco days.

407
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:08,780
他们了解这一片  帮我们和一些
They knew these parts, put us in touch

408
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:12,030
可以打听事儿的人牵线
with some names, people to talk to.

409
00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:13,830
你好
How we doing, boys?

410
00:27:13,870 --> 00:27:15,170
-嗨  -你好
- Hey. - Hello.

411
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:18,230
我们在找"小兔山庄"
We're looking for a little Bunny ranch

412
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:18,230
{\an8}"月光小兔山庄"是内华达州最负盛名的妓院之一

413
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:19,780
应该就在这附近
down around these parts.

414
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:22,430
你们知道哪儿能找到吗
Y'all know where we could find it?

415
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:24,550
-不知道  先生  -从没听说过
- No, sir. - Never heard about it?

416
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:26,560
-妓院  -没有
- Little whorehouse? - Nuh-uh.

417
00:27:26,570 --> 00:27:27,510
抱歉
Sorry, man.

418
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:29,660
在这里做木工的都这么趾高气扬的吗
Supposed to be stuck up in the woods around here?

419
00:27:30,130 --> 00:27:31,450
就这么跟你说吧
And I'll tell you this,

420
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:35,810
拉斯特是我见过的洞悉人性之弱点最厉害的人
Rust had about as sharp an eye for weakness as I ever seen.

421
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:44,240
我马上就回来
I'll be right back.

422
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,510
我的错
It's my bad, boys.

423
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,990
我们开篇开的不对
Think we got started on the wrong foot there.

424
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:05,870
记起来妓院在哪里了吗
You remember where that little whorehouse is, huh?

425
00:28:22,190 --> 00:28:24,160
走353南路
Take 353 South.

426
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:26,380
在到达14号公路之前要下去
Gonna exit off the shoulder before we get to the 14.

427
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:30,220
然后我们再走条废弃的钓鱼小路去陈纳德河口
From there, we take a dirt fishing road to Bayou Chenault.

428
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:33,380
好的
Okay.

429
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:11,260
就是这儿
That it?

430
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,100
警车啊
Cop car, y'all.

431
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:34,140
去试着要点免费赠品
Just trying to get some freebies.

432
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,410
我不接警察的活
I don't do no cops...

433
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:51,170
你好  女士
Hello, ma'am.

434
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:56,150
州立刑事调查局的马丁·哈特和拉斯特·科尔
Martin Hart, Rustin Cohle-- State CID.

435
00:29:57,890 --> 00:29:59,000
这是你的地方
This your place?

436
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,510
是我租的
It's my lease.

437
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:04,920
这里是什么  某种乡下的"小兔山庄"
What is this, some kind of hillbilly bunny ranch?

438
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,310
你说什么
Excuse me?

439
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,120
在你开始指控我罪名之前
You might want to talk to Sheriff Bilson

440
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:10,520
你应该先跟拜森治安官谈谈
'fore you start tossin' accusations around.

441
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:12,830
不用  我跟乡下佬没什么可闹的
No, I ain't got nothing against hillbillies.

442
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:15,590
别紧张  我不是为这个而来的  我们
Relax. That's not why we're here. We, uh,

443
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:17,440
有个女孩遇难了
well, something happened to a girl,

444
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,820
我们想知道你们有谁认识她
and we need to know if any of you knew her.

445
00:30:27,470 --> 00:30:29,300
对  这是朵莉
Yeah. That's Dori.

446
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:32,550
发生什么事了吗
Somethin' happened?

447
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:35,450
你知道那个在伊拉斯城外发现的女人吗
You know about that woman found outside of Erath?

448
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:39,050
天哪
Oh, no.

449
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:42,320
朵莉发生什么事了
Did something happen to Dori?

450
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:48,370
你们关系很好吗
Were you pretty good friends with her?

451
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:51,380
我刚来的时候  她对我很友好
She was nice to me when I first came around.

452
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:54,220
给了我一些建议和东西
Gave me tips and stuff.

453
00:30:56,010 --> 00:30:58,460
建议  关于什么的
Tips? About what?

454
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:04,320
没什么
Nothin'.

455
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,580
你懂的  就是怎么做妓女
You know, just how to be.

456
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:13,800
你知道她过去几周
You got any idea where she might

457
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,880
在哪儿呆着吗
have been staying the last few weeks?

458
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,160
不知道
I don't.

459
00:31:19,810 --> 00:31:21,270
她前男友在牢里
Her ex is in prison.

460
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,610
我猜她搬去了新的地方
I guess maybe she got a new place.

461
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:28,110
她还去教堂
She'd been going to church.

462
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:32,550
我还在指望也许她重新做人了
I was hoping maybe she just turned things around.

463
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:38,150
我们要询问所有有可能认识她的人
We're gonna need to question any girls might have known her.

464
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,460
这个要求可不好办
That's a tougher ask than you think.

465
00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:44,960
人们听见你们来了  都躲得远远的
Folks'll be stayin' away, they hear y'all are out here.

466
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,930
女士  可这是把我们打发走的最好方法
Well, ma'am, it's the best way to get us to leave.

467
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:54,040
你说她留下了一个包
You said she left a bag.

468
00:31:54,850 --> 00:31:55,740
对
Yeah.

469
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:57,280
我能看看吗
Can I see it?

470
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:04,880
当然
Sure.

471
00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:16,910
那个女孩还没成人
That girl's not 18.

472
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:21,040
治安官知道你这里有未成年人吗
The sheriff know you got underage working here?

473
00:32:21,130 --> 00:32:23,380
你知道这个女孩在哪儿呆过
What do you know about where that girl's been,

474
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:26,160
从哪儿来的吗
where she come from?

475
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:28,400
你想知道在她从她叔叔身边逃走之前
You want to know Beth's situation,

476
00:32:28,770 --> 00:32:30,910
过得是什么样的日子吗
'fore she ran out on her uncle?

477
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:34,760
她还有其它地方可以去
There are other places she could go.

478
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:39,210
你说的这是屁话
Such holy bullshit from you.

479
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:41,920
那是女人自己的身体  不是吗
It's a woman's body, ain't it?

480
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:43,860
女人自己的选择
A woman's choice.

481
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:46,650
对我来说  她还不算个女人呢
Well, she don't look like a woman to me.

482
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:49,470
这种年龄  她根本没能力
At that age, she is not equipped

483
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:51,410
做这种选择
to make those kind of choices.

484
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:54,800
但我猜只要能赚钱  你才不管
But I guess you don't give a shit what kind of damage

485
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:57,820
她怎么伤害自己呢
she's doing to herself, as long as you're making your money.

486
00:32:57,820 --> 00:33:02,230
这世界上有多少姑娘被白白糟蹋
Girls walk this Earth all the time screwin' for free.

487
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,530
现在你凭什么来搅合
Now, why is it you add business to the mix,

488
00:33:04,530 --> 00:33:07,360
你这样的男人居然说承受不了
and boys like you can't stand the thought?

489
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,490
我来告诉你原因
I'll tell you.

490
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,950
因为突然间  你失去了
It's 'cause suddenly you don't own it

491
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:13,760
你以为自己拥有的东西
the way you thought you did.

492
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:24,510
女士  你们给予了很大帮助
Ma'am, you've both been very helpful.

493
00:33:24,930 --> 00:33:26,040
我们保持联系
We'll be in touch.

494
00:33:27,050 --> 00:33:28,380
是的  感谢...
Yes, thank you...

495
00:33:29,850 --> 00:33:30,900
你的帮助
for your help.

496
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:43,160
去找找其他工作
Do something else.

497
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:58,920
那是订金吗
That a down payment?

498
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:04,100
你工作的其中一部分
Is shitting on any moment of decency

499
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:05,950
就是要把体面贬损得体无完肤吗
part of your job description?

500
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:12,270
我闭上眼睛  看到
"I closed my eyes and saw the king

501
00:34:12,270 --> 00:34:14,860
身穿黄袍的国王正穿越树林
in yellow moving through the forest."

502
00:34:16,450 --> 00:34:18,210
这是她的日记  小马
This is her diary, Marty.

503
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:20,210
真不敢相信
Believe this shit.

504
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:21,590
这么年轻的姑娘
A girl that young.

505
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:26,010
你知道吗  治安官也会抽一份利
You know the sheriff has got a stake in this place, too.

506
00:34:26,450 --> 00:34:28,020
见鬼的耶稣
Fucking Christ.

507
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:30,480
国王的孩子都有印记
"The king's children were marked.

508
00:34:30,990 --> 00:34:32,790
他们会变成他的天使
They became his angels."

509
00:34:39,950 --> 00:34:42,510
黄袍国王  卡寇莎
The yellow king, Carcosa.

510
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:44,720
疯话
Nut job.

511
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:48,270
无论她在做什么  都把她弄疯了
Fried her brain on whatever she was on.

512
00:34:48,270 --> 00:34:51,040
听着没头没尾的
Sounds like she didn't have much to begin with.

513
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:53,210
读起来好像一种幻想
Well, it reads like a fantasy.

514
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:58,230
会不会是他正给她用药
What if he was dosing her regular,

515
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,640
一段时间之后  在她无法察觉的情况下
and over a period of time, upping the dose

516
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:03,040
一点一点增加剂量
little by little without her knowing it?

517
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:06,260
我们应该四处检查一下
We should stay out here today, check around

518
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:08,770
看有没有路人认识她
for Johns maybe knew her.

519
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:09,610
{\an8}你是否迷失  孤独  耶稣会拯救你

520
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:11,850
看这个
Look at this.

521
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,170
是的
Oh, yeah.

522
00:35:16,430 --> 00:35:18,740
这有很多类似的活动
Man, a lot of these type places.

523
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:21,760
想吸引人来  然后游说他们
Expect the flock to canvass for 'em.

524
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,370
我们应该去看看
You know, we should go there.

525
00:35:23,110 --> 00:35:26,910
{\an8}崇拜团回归  现在还不晚  耶稣复活的伙伴们

526
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:26,280
可能是大家一直提起的那个教堂
Could be the church everyone mentioned.

527
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:28,830
先在外面跟路人打听打听
Well, let's check around for Johns while we're out here

528
00:35:28,830 --> 00:35:31,560
然后周一去这座教堂
and pick up the church on Monday.

529
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:36,990
你的很多材料都是被修改过的
Most of your stuff's still redacted.

530
00:35:37,490 --> 00:35:39,540
那么北岸是指什么
Now, what's Northshore?

531
00:35:41,810 --> 00:35:44,760
北岸精神病院
Northshore Psychiatric Hospital,

532
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:45,930
德克萨斯州  拉伯克
Lubbock, Texas.

533
00:35:45,930 --> 00:35:49,550
1993年我在那住了四个月
I spent 4 months there in '93.

534
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:52,260
-想说说这个吗  -没问题
- You feel like talking about that? - Well, sure.

535
00:35:52,870 --> 00:35:54,080
我才不在乎
Who gives a shit?

536
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:02,130
索菲亚  我女儿
Sofia... my daughter.

537
00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:07,490
她在我家车道上骑小三轮车
She was on her tricycle in our driveway. Um...

538
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:17,110
我们住的地方  那条小路有点弯曲
We lived down a -- where a little bend in the road, and...

539
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,170
他们说
They said that...

540
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:29,260
总之  然后
Anyway, afterwards, uh,

541
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:32,650
克莱尔和我反目成仇了
Claire and I turned on each other, you know?

542
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:37,910
我们互相抱怨死的为什么不是对方
We... we resented each other being alive, you know?

543
00:36:42,290 --> 00:36:46,700
我从劫案组转到扫毒组
I transferred from robbery to narco.

544
00:36:48,050 --> 00:36:50,790
我就开始每天24小时  每周7天地做这些事
Started hitting it, you know, 24/7.

545
00:36:51,350 --> 00:36:55,100
在街上搜刮  破门而入  三个月后
Street rips, knocking down doors, and within 3 months

546
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:58,670
我就该抢劫快递员  或者在华美达酒店醒过来
I was ripping off couriers or ending up in a Ramada Inn

547
00:36:58,670 --> 00:37:00,700
身边一堆该死的八球[毒品]
with a couple of fuckin' eight-balls.

548
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,180
没错
Oh, yeah.

549
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:07,820
就是那时  克莱尔走了
Somewhere in there, Claire left,

550
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:11,080
也是那时
and somewhere in there,

551
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:13,720
我把满膛子弹打在了一个瘾君子身上
I emptied a 9 into a crankhead

552
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:16,740
因为他要给他襁褓中的女儿注射冰毒
for injecting his infant daughter with crystal.

553
00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:20,680
他说要净化他女儿
Said he was trying to purify her.

554
00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:26,560
检察官给了我一次机会  免于进监狱
State attorney gave me one chance to stay out of jail.

555
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,050
他说  我们可以让你的资料不受影响
He said, "You can keep your profile,

556
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:30,750
但我们想让你做我们的瘾君子线人
but we want to make you our wild man junkie."

557
00:37:31,930 --> 00:37:35,030
他们说到做到  把我弄回了街上
So they did. They made me a floater, like a trick.

558
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:36,140
你懂得  所有探员
You know, any agency or

559
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:38,950
或部门都需要有一个深度卧底的缉毒警
department needed a deep undercover narco,

560
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:40,500
他们选中了我
they got me,

561
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:43,730
而且没有刑满的那一天
and there was no fuckin' expiration date, baby.

562
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,970
他们让你做了四年线人对吧
And they kept you out there for 4 years?

563
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:51,680
1993年2月
And then, February of '93,

564
00:37:51,850 --> 00:37:54,910
我在休斯顿港杀了三个贩毒集团的人
I killed 3 cartel men in Port Houston.

565
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:58,900
我被判了三个25年徒刑  最后
I took three 25s in the side and ended up

566
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:02,910
被送进了德州拉伯克的北岸精神病院
at Northshore Psychiatric Hospital in Lubbock, Texas,

567
00:38:03,850 --> 00:38:05,950
这本身就够好笑的了
which is kind of funny in its own rite--

568
00:38:06,330 --> 00:38:09,040
在德州拉伯克精神病院
psych ward being in Lubbock, Texas. Heh!

569
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:12,980
你去过吗  他们还要给我精神病抚恤金
You ever been there? They offered me a psych pension.

570
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:15,040
算是中奖了  对吧
Jackpot, right?

571
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,220
但我拒绝了
And I said no.

572
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:20,210
我说  把我调到凶杀组吧
I said, "Put me on homicide somewhere."

573
00:38:20,610 --> 00:38:23,510
他们欠了我不少人情
By then, I was owed quite a few favors,

574
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:27,230
所以  就把我调到路易斯安那来了
and, uh, Louisiana was what they had.

575
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:33,650
是啊  那之后好长时间
Yeah, for a long time after,

576
00:38:33,650 --> 00:38:35,910
我都睡不好
I -- I didn't really sleep.

577
00:38:37,210 --> 00:38:41,380
噩梦  创伤后应激障碍  身心俱疲什么的
Nightmares, PTSD, exhausted nerves, whatever.

578
00:39:14,750 --> 00:39:16,080
没错
Yeah.

579
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:19,830
为什么要到凶杀组
Why homicide?

580
00:39:22,170 --> 00:39:24,660
跟我在北岸看到的事有关
Oh, something I saw at Northshore.

581
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:28,180
柯林斯原话是这么说的
Quote from Corinthians.

582
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:36,060
"一体分离成众人"
"The body is not one member, but many."

583
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:43,200
"众人汇聚成一体"
"Now are they many, but... of one body."

584
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:45,820
那是什么意思
What's that mean, though?

585
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:51,040
我只是想在这个群体中保有一席之地
I was just trying to stay a part of the body now.

586
00:39:52,350 --> 00:39:54,350
这根鱼竿坏掉了
The fishing pole's not working.

587
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:56,600
-那就去找爷爷  -才不要
- Just ask Grandpa. - No.

588
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:59,860
爷爷  我不知道这根鱼竿好不好用
Grandpa, I can't tell if it's working.

589
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:02,420
亲爱的  等鱼咬钩了你就知道了
You'll know, honey. It'll yank at you hard.

590
00:40:02,870 --> 00:40:05,210
-好吧  -你怎么不...
- Okay. - Why don't you...

591
00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:08,040
案子查的怎么样了  那个大案子
How's that case going? The big one?

592
00:40:10,350 --> 00:40:12,270
还在查
Working it, you know.

593
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:17,620
我年轻时这种事可不常发生
Things like that didn't happen these parts when I was young.

594
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:19,560
人们嘴边挂着"女士""先生"
People said "Ma'am" And "Sir."

595
00:40:20,310 --> 00:40:21,880
一家人总是聚在一起
Families stayed together.

596
00:40:23,810 --> 00:40:25,570
那都是过去时光了
Yeah, that's how it was, huh?

597
00:40:27,310 --> 00:40:28,390
也不都是
Not all the time.

598
00:40:29,570 --> 00:40:30,840
过去的人更看重面子
There was more dignity.

599
00:40:31,490 --> 00:40:34,430
没人会走上大街  嚷嚷着要权利
Everyone wasn't out in the street, yelling about their rights.

600
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:38,880
要是真的那么好
Well, if things were so great,

601
00:40:39,410 --> 00:40:41,360
他们也不会想要改变了
they never would have changed.

602
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:44,020
什么事都没有
Nothing is going on.

603
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:45,660
我只是告诉你  要是出了什么事
I'm just saying, if there's a problem,

604
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:47,320
你可以找我谈谈
you can talk to me. You know that.

605
00:40:47,450 --> 00:40:48,450
要是我跟谁闹了矛盾
If I have a problem with someone,

606
00:40:48,450 --> 00:40:50,020
我会跟那些人谈的  妈妈
I talk to them, Ma.

607
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:51,990
你也应该能跟我谈谈
Well, you should be able to talk to me.

608
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:54,450
我知道婚姻是什么滋味
I know what it's like to be married to a man.

609
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:57,520
你以为男人都一个德行吗
You think they're all the same, huh?

610
00:40:58,270 --> 00:40:59,910
我不明白为什么你对我如此粗鲁
I don't know why you're so rude to me.

611
00:40:59,910 --> 00:41:01,970
你在外面受气  别冲我发火
If you're frustrated, don't take it out on me.

612
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:04,720
我觉得你该把电视修好
I think that you need to get your cable fixed

613
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,990
少把我往狗血肥皂剧里套
and stop confusing me with your soap operas.

614
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:09,550
你是在搅和无法掌控的事
Well, you beat up on what you can't control.

615
00:41:10,170 --> 00:41:12,290
让周围的人都跟你遭殃
Makes it bad for everybody else.

616
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:15,260
-我不会用  -关我屁事  自己摆弄去
- I don't know how. - I don't care. Just try.

617
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:17,430
-你给我弄  -我不管
- You do it. - I can't.

618
00:41:17,430 --> 00:41:19,020
你手比较小
You have smaller fingers.

619
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:20,470
梅茜  你就自己来吧
Macie, just do it.

620
00:41:22,930 --> 00:41:25,040
你觉得这个世界没有变糟
So you're telling me the world isn't getting worse?

621
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:28,520
现在的孩子  一身黑衣服
I seen kids today, all in black,

622
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:31,340
浓妆艳抹  脸上涂得不成人样
wearing makeup, shit on their faces.

623
00:41:31,570 --> 00:41:33,030
满口黄腔
Everything's sex.

624
00:41:33,650 --> 00:41:34,620
还有克林顿
Clinton.

625
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,220
回顾历史
You know, throughout history,

626
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:41,620
我敢打赌所有老一辈都说过同样的话
I bet every old man probably said the same thing.

627
00:41:42,090 --> 00:41:43,500
老一辈死了之后
And old men die,

628
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,550
世界依旧向前发展
and the world keeps spinning.

629
00:41:48,390 --> 00:41:50,150
-姑娘们怎么样了  -我找到了一条线索
- How are the girls? - I got this lead--

630
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:54,630
我找到了一条线索  我要去查查看
I got this lead I wanted to check up on.

631
00:41:54,630 --> 00:41:55,780
我跟你说起过
I told you about it.

632
00:41:56,150 --> 00:41:58,220
-你父亲可以送你回去  -不要
- Maybe your dad could bring you back. - No.

633
00:41:58,230 --> 00:41:59,760
你根本就没跟我说过
You didn't tell me anything about it.

634
00:42:00,610 --> 00:42:01,910
这可是家庭聚会
This is a family day.

635
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:05,070
我真的跟你说起过
I did tell you about it.

636
00:42:05,070 --> 00:42:08,140
我提起过  是那个新案子
I mentioned it. It's the new case.

637
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:15,000
好吧  那我们一起回去吧
Okay, well, how about we all head back, then?

638
00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:17,100
好  亲爱的
Hmm. All right, sweetheart.

639
00:42:18,690 --> 00:42:19,950
上岸吧  我们回家了
Come on! Let's go!

640
00:42:20,150 --> 00:42:21,900
我的钓鱼线都缠到一起了
My line's tangled.

641
00:42:21,950 --> 00:42:23,320
快把船划回来
Just paddle in.

642
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,990
-好吧  -我说了吧
- Okay. - Told you!

643
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:28,180
多谢下午的招待
Thanks for the lovely afternoon.

644
00:42:31,630 --> 00:42:32,540
谢谢你们
Thank you.

645
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:00,230
下午好  先生
Afternoon, sir.

646
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:03,130
-您好  警官  -我想问你个问题
- How you doing today, Officer? - I have a question for you.

647
00:43:03,130 --> 00:43:04,350
你见过这个女孩吗
You ever seen this girl?

648
00:43:05,230 --> 00:43:06,550
从没见过她吗
You never seen her before?

649
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:09,040
-从没见过  -在这没见过
- Never before. - Hm-mmm, not here.

650
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:35,830
问个问题
Question.

651
00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:39,090
我在找这个女士  你认识她吗
I'm looking for this young lady. You recognize her?

652
00:43:40,270 --> 00:43:42,140
给点"提示"会比较好
I might need a memory jog.

653
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:44,350
她叫朵拉  很年轻  金发
Dora. Young blonde?

654
00:43:44,690 --> 00:43:46,710
朵拉  朵拉  朵拉  朵拉  朵拉
Dora. Dora, Dora, Dora, Dora.

655
00:43:47,820 --> 00:43:48,750
朵拉
Dora.

656
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:50,700
最近有没有哪个男人
Have any guys come around lately,

657
00:43:50,710 --> 00:43:52,750
来这不只是找乐子那么简单
looking for anything more than a good time?

658
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:55,250
再给你点钱你能想起点别的吗
You might be able to remember for a little more money?

659
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:56,470
也许吧
I might.

660
00:43:56,470 --> 00:43:57,300
是吗
You might?

661
00:44:05,970 --> 00:44:09,140
这么多年了
Years we've been through this.

662
00:44:10,250 --> 00:44:11,500
亲爱的  听我说
Sweetheart, listen to me.

663
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:14,040
我只想跟你们在一起
There is nowhere else I want to be.

664
00:44:15,790 --> 00:44:17,290
你可能都没意识到自己在撒谎
I wonder if you even know you're lying.

665
00:44:17,290 --> 00:44:19,090
得了吧
Oh, come on!

666
00:44:21,150 --> 00:44:22,070
我每天
Bad enough,

667
00:44:22,070 --> 00:44:26,100
都要面对一堆烂事  已经够糟的了
the shit I got to wade through on a daily basis,

668
00:44:26,110 --> 00:44:28,690
连上了三十小时的班  好不容易到了周末
bring me this "Feel bad for me" crap

669
00:44:29,050 --> 00:44:32,920
却要听你爸爸放屁  你还给我一脸
when I work 30 hours straight and spent the weekend

670
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:35,190
"我真惨"的表情
listening to your dad's bullshit?

671
00:44:35,450 --> 00:44:38,390
我回家  家应该是一个
I come home, the one place

672
00:44:38,450 --> 00:44:41,010
充满祥和宁静的地方
where there's supposed to be peace and calm,

673
00:44:41,010 --> 00:44:43,190
-你却让我去听...  -谁跟你说的
- and you throw this shit... - Who told you that?

674
00:44:44,060 --> 00:44:46,590
家并不总是那样的  也不该是那样
It's not always that way. It's not supposed to be.

675
00:44:46,590 --> 00:44:49,950
那本该是我想要的  那本该帮助我
It's supposed to be what I want, it's supposed to help me.

676
00:44:49,950 --> 00:44:51,080
我们就是在帮助你
We do help you!

677
00:44:51,250 --> 00:44:52,890
一直如此
All the goddamn time!

678
00:44:56,930 --> 00:44:59,020
好吧  你想让我说什么
Okay, well, what do you want me to say?

679
00:44:59,020 --> 00:45:03,330
你想让我谈谈那个 有鹿角的女人吗
You want me to talk about the woman, had antlers?

680
00:45:03,330 --> 00:45:06,170
你想让我跟你谈谈那些消失的孩子吗
Do you want me to tell you about the kids disappearing,

681
00:45:06,170 --> 00:45:10,180
那样你就能不再发牢骚说自己有多惨了吗
and maybe you'll stop with the "poor me" little whiny bullshit?

682
00:45:11,970 --> 00:45:14,280
你觉得我是这个意思吗
Is that what you're saying, hmm?

683
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:16,780
你觉得我是想让你觉得我有多惨
That I'm trying to make you feel bad for me?

684
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:20,160
你真这么认为吗
Is that really how you want to play this?

685
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:22,520
不  亲爱的
No, honey.

686
00:45:22,550 --> 00:45:25,780
我觉得你是我见过的最好的女人
I think you're the greatest woman I ever met,

687
00:45:25,780 --> 00:45:28,450
遇见你是我人生最美妙的事
and you're the greatest thing that ever happened to me.

688
00:45:28,990 --> 00:45:31,760
但是  真的  有时候
But, yeah, you know, sometimes

689
00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:34,850
我觉得你好像很容易
I think you might have a penchant

690
00:45:35,540 --> 00:45:36,840
自怨自艾
for self-pity.

691
00:45:37,130 --> 00:45:39,260
而现在  我希望你坚强一点
And right now, I need you to be strong

692
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:41,210
让我好做自己的工作
so that I can do my job.

693
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,330
你现在患上了选择性失聪
You have developed some sort of selective deafness.

694
00:45:48,130 --> 00:45:50,890
你以前可不是这种懦夫
You used to not be such a chicken shit, I swear.

695
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:57,880
连你妈都觉得你很难缠
Even your mom thinks you're a ball-buster.

696
00:46:07,490 --> 00:46:08,650
去叫孩子们来吃饭
Tell the girls dinner.

697
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:25,680
你失去爸爸或妈妈了
You don't have a mommy or daddy anymore.

698
00:46:26,330 --> 00:46:28,580
他[她]在事故中死了
Yours just died in an accident.

699
00:46:29,770 --> 00:46:30,580
怎么死的
How?

700
00:46:31,390 --> 00:46:33,560
车祸  有人…
In a car accident. Someone--

701
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:36,490
吃晚饭了  孩子们  去厨房吧
Dinnertime, kids. Go to the kitchen.

702
00:46:36,770 --> 00:46:37,940
你来吃吗
Are you coming?

703
00:46:38,740 --> 00:46:40,480
当然  我都快饿死了
Yeah, of course. I'm starving.

704
00:46:40,490 --> 00:46:41,350
真的吗
Really?

705
00:46:41,750 --> 00:46:44,530
-真的  -太好了
- Yeah, really. - Good.

706
00:46:59,190 --> 00:47:01,080
你知道我现在是怎么想我女儿的吗
You know how I think about my daughter now?

707
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:04,710
你知道吗
You know what...

708
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:08,100
那些她没遭受的折磨
what she was spared?

709
00:47:12,170 --> 00:47:13,760
有时我很庆幸
Sometimes I feel grateful.

710
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:21,310
医生们说
Doctors said

711
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:23,660
她当时毫无感觉
she didn't feel a thing.

712
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:26,260
直接昏迷了
Went straight into a coma,

713
00:47:27,710 --> 00:47:29,440
然后  在那片黑暗中的…
and then, somewhere in that...

714
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:34,140
某一处  她悄无声息地离开了
blackness, she slipped off into another,

715
00:47:35,510 --> 00:47:36,690
去了更深沉的黑暗中
deeper kind.

716
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:44,600
这种死法不是很美吗
Isn't that a beautiful way to go out?

717
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:49,000
毫无痛苦
Painlessly,

718
00:47:50,710 --> 00:47:52,440
就是个快乐的孩子
as a happy child.

719
00:47:59,510 --> 00:48:00,700
以后才死的麻烦就在于…
Yeah, trouble with...

720
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:04,280
你已经长大了
dying later is you've already grown up.

721
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:06,820
伤害已经造成  太晚了
Damage is done. It's too late.

722
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:10,440
你有孩子吗
You got kids?

723
00:48:15,940 --> 00:48:18,200
你们必须足够
Well, you got the hubris

724
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:20,820
自大
it must take to...

725
00:48:22,050 --> 00:48:24,890
才会从虚无中凭空找来一个灵魂
yank a soul out of nonexistence

726
00:48:25,330 --> 00:48:28,350
塞到孩子的肉体中
into this meat.

727
00:48:30,430 --> 00:48:34,310
并让一条生命受困于此
And to force a life into this thresher.

728
00:48:38,780 --> 00:48:41,070
至于我女儿  她…
And as for my daughter, she, uh...

729
00:48:43,110 --> 00:48:45,260
她让我免遭为人父的
she spared me the sin

730
00:48:46,350 --> 00:48:47,650
罪孽
of being a father.

731
00:48:48,990 --> 00:48:50,310
凯思琳
Hey, Cathleen,

732
00:48:50,540 --> 00:48:52,110
你个小狐狸精
you little vixen.

733
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:54,680
能给我来点咖啡吗
Any chance of some coffee?

734
00:48:54,810 --> 00:48:56,790
-当然  -好吧
- Of course. - Okay.

735
00:48:57,160 --> 00:48:58,390
这些人是谁
Who are these guys?

736
00:48:58,750 --> 00:49:02,520
柯萨达带来的几个混球  咖啡马上来
Some assholes Quesada brought in. Coffee on its way.

737
00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:04,070
早上好  小马
Hey, morning, Marty.

738
00:49:04,460 --> 00:49:07,460
组长正在给我介绍新来的特警队
Major's introducing me. New flying squad.

739
00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:09,720
你认识马克·多特里  泰德·贝特朗
You know Mark Daughtry, Ted Bertrand.

740
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:11,530
多特里
Daughtry.

741
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:13,180
泰德
Ted.

742
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:15,200
-吉米·杜福伦  -吉米·杜福伦
- Jimmy Dufrene. - Jimmy Dufrene.

743
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:16,860
怎么了
What's up?

744
00:49:17,490 --> 00:49:18,470
我们接到任务
We've been tasked with

745
00:49:18,470 --> 00:49:21,050
调查一些可能和灵异现象有关的犯罪
investigating crimes with possible occult links.

746
00:49:21,050 --> 00:49:23,310
最近出现很多残害动物
There's been a rash of animal mutilations,

747
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:24,680
亵渎坟墓的行为
cemeteries defiled.

748
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:27,430
他们想看看我们在兰的案子上有什么发现
And they want to see what we have on the Lange case.

749
00:49:27,630 --> 00:49:30,000
这项工作  局长
Well, this task force is important to the Commander

750
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,660
和州办公室都很重视
and to the Governor's Office.

751
00:49:31,810 --> 00:49:34,460
你知道  很多人都关心这件事
You know, a lot of people are concerned about it.

752
00:49:34,890 --> 00:49:36,750
我可看不出两只死猫和一个被杀女子之间
You know, me, I don't see the connection

753
00:49:36,750 --> 00:49:39,230
有什么关系
between two dead cats and a murdered woman.

754
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:42,000
不过我是从德克萨斯来的
But then, I'm from Texas.

755
00:49:44,610 --> 00:49:46,160
我们无意冒犯  小马
We're not stepping on your toes, Marty.

756
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:47,160
我们也只是听从命令
We just got the mandate.

757
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:48,790
我们要互相交换一下情报
We got to compare notes with what you got.

758
00:49:48,790 --> 00:49:49,450
当然
Yeah.

759
00:49:49,450 --> 00:49:50,710
给你咖啡  警探
Here you are, Detective.

760
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:53,000
-谢谢  凯思琳  -不客气
- Thanks, Cathleen. - You got it.

761
00:49:53,460 --> 00:49:54,740
把你们想要的都复印一份吧
Xerox all you want.

762
00:49:55,950 --> 00:49:57,570
那你们就会觉得自己是个好警察了
Make you feel like good cops.

763
00:50:06,570 --> 00:50:08,430
你们两个  来我办公室
You two, my office.

764
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:14,310
科尔  我定了个新规矩  特别是对你
Cohle, we got a new rule around here, especially for you.

765
00:50:14,550 --> 00:50:17,000
当你对任何事有意见的时候
You got an opinion about anything,

766
00:50:17,660 --> 00:50:18,910
别说出来
you hold on to it.

767
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:22,030
要么别说  要么就告诉小马
You hold on to it or you tell it to Marty.

768
00:50:22,410 --> 00:50:24,700
否则就把你那张大嘴给我缝严实了
Otherwise, button your big, fat mouth.

769
00:50:25,490 --> 00:50:27,890
不管你有多聪明  都没你想的那么聪明
However smart you are, you're not as smart as you think.

770
00:50:27,890 --> 00:50:29,510
别扯淡了  头儿
Be serious, boss.

771
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:33,350
都是他妈的废话
This God-bothering shit.

772
00:50:33,350 --> 00:50:35,650
那都是些政治套话  你懂的
It's a political circle-jerk. You know this.

773
00:50:35,650 --> 00:50:37,450
这是你乱搞的地方吗
Is this a place you live?

774
00:50:38,170 --> 00:50:39,530
你觉得你是在哪儿
Where are you, huh?

775
00:50:40,050 --> 00:50:43,830
这几周你有进展吗  抓到嫌疑人了吗
You had anything in the last weeks? You got a suspect?

776
00:50:43,830 --> 00:50:44,830
多给我们几个人
Give us some more guys

777
00:50:44,830 --> 00:50:47,040
去跟踪重点对象  做记录
to follow up KAs, track records.

778
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:50,770
不  我们老板根本不想用你  明白吗
No, our bosses don't want you at all, you understand?

779
00:50:50,770 --> 00:50:51,960
我也不想用你
I don't want you.

780
00:50:52,580 --> 00:50:55,270
你能在这儿完全是因为这个人的信誉担保
You are upright only by the grace of this man's reputation.

781
00:50:56,630 --> 00:50:57,820
该死的  科尔
Goddamn, Cohle.

782
00:50:57,820 --> 00:51:01,300
我还得说什么才能让你他妈闭嘴啊
How many ways are there for me to say, "Shut the fuck up"?

783
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:06,620
我们要服从命令  不是吗
I mean, we work under command, right?

784
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:10,780
现在我们的上司要我们公开  高调的回应
Now, our betters want a public, high-profile show of response.

785
00:51:11,730 --> 00:51:13,600
妈的  现在有个参议员
Shit, I got a state senator,

786
00:51:13,610 --> 00:51:16,490
非要把那撒旦式涂鸦当作仇恨犯罪
he's trying to label Satanic graffiti as a hate crime.

787
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:19,940
这跟我们的数据库没有关系  这是事实
That has nothing to do with our DB, and that's the fact of it.

788
00:51:19,940 --> 00:51:21,470
好吧  好吧  行
Okay, okay. Fine.

789
00:51:21,470 --> 00:51:23,430
就算是真的  行吗
Let's say that's true, all right?

790
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:26,270
就算让你们全权负责这个案子
Let's say that you guys get the case all to yourselves.

791
00:51:27,450 --> 00:51:30,360
你有过调查一件谋杀案一周以上还一无所获吗
You ever solve a murder, been in the red more than a week?

792
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:32,080
有过一个案子不是
You ever clear one where two rounds

793
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:34,000
两轮审问之后就乖乖招了的吗
of questions didn't hand you the fucking answer?

794
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,830
-拜托  -你们有线索  有时间线
- Oh, come on-- - No, no, you got leads, you got a timeline.

795
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:38,910
你知道我有什么吗  我有一本侦探小说
You know what I got? I got a whodunit

796
00:51:38,910 --> 00:51:40,760
写着我的两个警探无所作为
where my two detectives are stalling,

797
00:51:41,290 --> 00:51:44,740
还有一个新的特别小组想接手这案子
and I got a brand-new task force wants to take it off our hands.

798
00:51:44,740 --> 00:51:45,580
我们有个线索
We have a lead--

799
00:51:45,580 --> 00:51:47,900
看在上帝的份上  闭嘴  科尔
Oh, for Christ's sake. Fuck off, Cohle.

800
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:52,980
上帝
Christ.

801
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:55,730
你决定吧
It's your call.

802
00:51:57,380 --> 00:51:59,060
你想放弃这个案子吗
You want to dump this one off?

803
00:51:59,220 --> 00:52:01,190
鉴于公众的反应  我会考虑下的
You know, I'd think about it, given the spotlight.

804
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:05,020
泰德·贝特朗是个好警探  你知道他的
You know, Teddy Bertrand's a good detective. You know him.

805
00:52:09,260 --> 00:52:11,480
你就算闭上嘴还是个自以为是的家伙
Well, you're a smart-ass with your mouth shut.

806
00:52:12,620 --> 00:52:13,690
我只是想说
I was just gonna say

807
00:52:14,260 --> 00:52:15,580
我们有一条线索指向一个教堂
we've got a lead on a church.

808
00:52:15,580 --> 00:52:18,150
被害人在那里呆了很长时间
Our vic was spending a lot of time there.

809
00:52:18,150 --> 00:52:20,950
我们现在正要去调查这个  可能是个突破点
That's where we were headed. It could be the break we need.

810
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:23,830
这么说  不管他们做什么
Inside, whatever they're putting over you,

811
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:26,390
你还能为我们争取多少时间
how much more time could you get us?

812
00:52:26,540 --> 00:52:28,680
现在不好说  还有得谈  但是
Right now, it's up for discussion, but,

813
00:52:29,300 --> 00:52:31,260
塔特尔在火上浇油
you know, Tuttle's lighting a fire under this.

814
00:52:31,260 --> 00:52:34,150
没有嫌疑犯  他们就会
Without a suspect, they're just gonna

815
00:52:34,150 --> 00:52:37,090
不问问题直接下命令了  小马
stop asking questions, Marty, and they're gonna give orders.

816
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:38,140
就这样
That's that.

817
00:52:39,490 --> 00:52:41,220
给我们点时间  这个月之内吧
Give us the rest of the month

818
00:52:41,670 --> 00:52:42,970
趁着他们还没把这个案子归结成
before they lump it into whatever

819
00:52:42,980 --> 00:52:45,800
什么特别小组需要的鬼样子  行吗
the play is with the task force, yeah?

820
00:52:48,460 --> 00:52:49,410
我尽量
I'll try.

821
00:52:50,710 --> 00:52:53,420
两周时间  然后你们就继续上街抓人去吧
Two weeks, and then you two start catching again.

822
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:54,090
好
Yeah.

823
00:52:58,200 --> 00:52:59,670
我们直奔主题吧
Let's cut to the point.

824
00:52:59,670 --> 00:53:02,200
说白了  你们就是想问
As the crow flies, y'all are wanting to ask

825
00:53:02,210 --> 00:53:05,710
树林里的那场大败  对吧
about that big throwdown in the woods, yeah?

826
00:53:06,070 --> 00:53:07,170
最后会问的  当然
Eventually, sure.

827
00:53:07,470 --> 00:53:09,280
现在我们只是想追查这个案子
Right now, we're just trying to track the case.

828
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:11,640
特别是科尔如何解决的
How Cohle worked it, especially.

829
00:53:14,470 --> 00:53:17,670
说明你们认为我粗枝大叶到意识不到
Which indicates you think I'm too thick to realize

830
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:20,810
你们是想找人麻烦
that y'all are trying to jam somebody up.

831
00:53:22,030 --> 00:53:23,570
你们之前肯定没遇到过这种情况
You're on to something new.

832
00:53:26,690 --> 00:53:29,420
所以科尔不想把案子移交给特别小组
So Cohle didn't want to give it to the task force.

833
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:31,020
你呢
Did you?

834
00:53:35,990 --> 00:53:38,750
不  我也不想
No, I did not.

835
00:53:48,570 --> 00:53:51,850
这没道理  这里什么都没有
It don't make sense. There is nothing out here.

836
00:53:54,090 --> 00:53:57,450
按照地图  应该就在几公里之内
According to this map, it should be within these few miles.

837
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:05,170
{\an8}耶稣会拯救你

838
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:04,220
如果是那种临时性的
Well-- ahem-- I guess if it's one of those

839
00:54:04,220 --> 00:54:06,910
开信仰复兴布道会的地方  会经常迁移的
tent revival places, they move around.

840
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:08,730
是啊
Yeah.

841
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:11,320
临时场所经常这样
Tents usually do.

842
00:54:14,030 --> 00:54:17,340
这张传单上没有日期  很奇怪
There's no date on this flyer, which is strange.

843
00:54:23,290 --> 00:54:24,740
那是什么
Something up there.

844
00:55:12,990 --> 00:55:14,120
等等  上一句
Wait, wait, back up.

845
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:17,300
你是说你在工作时产生了幻觉
Are you saying you were hallucinating on the job?

846
00:55:18,990 --> 00:55:20,260
不  我是说  我可以
No. I mean, I could always

847
00:55:20,270 --> 00:55:22,800
区别开什么是真实的什么不是
tell what was real or what wasn't, you know.

848
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:26,610
所以当我产生幻觉的时候  我就会顺其自然
So when I'd see things, like, man, I'd just-- -- roll with it.

849
00:55:27,340 --> 00:55:28,630
你现在还会产生幻觉
You still see things?

850
00:55:30,530 --> 00:55:31,260
不会了
No.

851
00:55:34,210 --> 00:55:36,080
不  在我戒毒的几年之后
No, they stopped altogether

852
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:39,450
就彻底消失了
after I was clean a couple years.

853
00:55:39,980 --> 00:55:41,830
这个地方没有门牌号
No numbers on this place.

854
00:55:43,810 --> 00:55:46,280
火灾肯定发生在很久之前
Fire must have happened a long time ago.

855
00:56:19,490 --> 00:56:22,320
好吧  这个地方毁了
Okay. Place is trashed.

856
00:56:23,530 --> 00:56:25,230
什么东西都没有了
This ain't no kinda anything.

857
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:33,010
在那个时候  那些异象
Yeah, back then, the visions.

858
00:56:34,770 --> 00:56:38,700
大多数时候  我都确信不会再有了
Yeah, most of the time, I was convinced that I'd lost it.

859
00:56:40,540 --> 00:56:41,350
小马
Marty?

860
00:56:56,830 --> 00:56:58,770
但还有些时候
But there were other times...

861
00:57:05,820 --> 00:57:10,100
我觉得自己仍沉溺于探索宇宙的神秘真相之中
I thought I was mainlining the secret truth of the universe.
