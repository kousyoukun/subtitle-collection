你觉得是怎么回事

有人杀了这个女孩  用她的尸体大做文章
Someone killed this girl, made a big show of it...

21
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:07,160
在你们的一间旧教堂上

22
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:08,760
留下了一幅犯罪现场的画
on one of your old churches.

23
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,030
你太沉迷了
You're obsessive.

24
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:11,470
你也沉迷
You're obsessive, too,

25
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:12,950
只不过不是沉迷工作
just not about the job.

26
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:14,540
所以你要跟那个人回家吗
So are you gonna go home with this guy?

27
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:16,330
这真的不关你事
It's really none of your business.

我什么都没听说
I didn't hear anything,

她服用了冰毒和迷幻剂
She was positive for meth and LSD.

34
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:28,310
你有没有想过
You ever think maybe

35
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:30,920
他可能是想把事情往他希望的方向推动呢
he tried to push things where he wanted them to go?

36
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,720
我们这案子有线索了  头儿
Hey, we caught a break in the case, boss.

37
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,230
我以为你们已经不管那个案子了
I thought you were handing that off.

38
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:36,390

勒杜在阿沃伊斯蹲了两年
Ledoux did two years at Avoyelles,

44
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,140

勒杜知道她的情况  对吗
Ledoux knew about her, right?

75
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,710
你跟他提过她吗

76
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:44,370
没错  男人在一起不就聊这些

79
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:49,930
给他看过她的照片  对吗

80
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:51,250
是啊  可能给他看过

82
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:54,620
让我没事可以看看

83
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:57,210

他是个大块头
He was a big guy--

85
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:01,130
比你块头大多了
a lot bigger than you.

00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,170
你是说你们关系不好吗

不  大部分时候  关系挺好的

You've got to, you're sharing a house,

89
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:08,490
就像我刚说的
like I'm saying.

90
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:10,840
我是说  他可以让你嗨起来
I mean, he gets you high, man,

91
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,770
但他是个怪胎  我压根不想认识他
but he's creep. I ain't want to know him.

92
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:14,620
跟我说说勒杜的事
Tell me about Ledoux.

93
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:16,270
怎么怪胎了
How is he creep?

94
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:19,920
他是个厨子  像个化学家一样
He's a cook, you know, like a chemist?

95
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:22,560
他能用厨房里的东西搞出花样
He used to, uh, make shit out of kitchen stuff--

96
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,210
煮煮清洁剂之类乱七八糟的东西
cook down cleansers and whatnot.

97
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,950
用土豆皮和炸东西的油做高挥发性酸浆
Used tater skins and fry grease to make high-test sour mash.

98
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:31,130
他很懂这些东西  但是  怎么说呢
He got mad knowledge for that shit, but, like, I don't know, man,

99
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:33,280
他说话的时候像个恋童癖似的
he talk like a short-eyes, like something.

100
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,730
你什么意思  他不会在这里说那些吧
How you mean? He wouldn't talk that shit up in here.

101
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:37,730
不  伙计  他没有
No, man, he didn't.

102
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:38,820
只是有时候  我和他到了晚上
Like, me and him at night,

103
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,650
用他做的那些东西爽翻天
blasted up on one of his mixes.

104
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:43,560
他做的有些玩意儿
I mean, he could brew some shit up

105
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,630
能搞得你腾云驾雾
put you up out your head, man.

106
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:46,120
在这里头可太牛逼了
That's a big deal in here.

107
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,690
操他妈的  出去了也牛逼
I mean, fuck, man, it's a big deal out there, too.

108
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:51,910
他说了些什么乱七八糟的
So, uh, what kind of shit was he talking?

109
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,860
他说在这儿往南有个地方
He said that there's this place down south

110
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:59,520
有钱人都去那里  搞邪恶的仪式
where all these rich men go to, uh, devil-worship.

111
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,390
他说...

以及黄袍国王

117
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:16,240

He said there's all these, like, old stones out in the woods,

118
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:19,300
人们去那里朝拜

119
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,760
他说...
He said, uh...

He said there's just so much good killin' down there.

121
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:27,660
雷金背上有个烙印
Reggie got this brand on his back,

122
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,080
像个螺纹
like in a spiral?

123
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:31,560
他说这是他们的标志
He says that's their sign.

124
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:33,850
这他妈的  你们懂了吗
What the fuck ever, you understand?

125
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:35,340
我不想听这家伙说话的  可他是个大个子
I don't listen to the man, but he's big,

126
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:37,590
所以我也不能叫他闭嘴
so I don't tell him to shut the fuck up, neither!

127
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:40,690
你记得他说起过什么朋友吗
You remember any buddies he ever talked about?

128
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:43,060
我们查过这里的记录
So we checked the records here,

129
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:45,060
从没人来看过他
and he hadn't ever had any visitors.

130
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,400
我们都认识泰龙·威姆斯
We both know Tyrone Weems.

131
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,130
泰龙或许会告诉你们他在哪
Tyrone like to tell you where he's at.

132
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:54,610
伙计  雷金是个货真价实的疯子
Look, man, Reggie's crazy, like, for real.

133
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:05,830
跟一个整天在你耳边
Had to be tough,

134
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:09,840
胡言乱语的疯子一起住
living with somebody spouting insane shit

135
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,700
日子肯定不好过
in your ear all day long.

136
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,570
我告诉了你们那么多  你们不给我点回报吗
You gonna give me something for what I told you just now?

137
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:17,100
给你假释
Parole Board nod.

138
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:18,960
公平合理
Fair's fair.

139
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,800
你们觉得因为我跟他提起过朵拉...
You think 'cause I talked to him about Dori that...

140
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:37,920
所以是我害死了她吗
I might have got her killed?

141
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:42,190
你脱不了干系
You probably had something to do with it.

142
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:47,790
我觉得你不该给他看那些照片的
I don't think you should have shown him those pictures.

143
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:50,320
你觉得呢
Do you?

144
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:11,280
我们得找到这个泰龙·威姆斯

你不必告诉他这是他的错

151
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:24,120

对这个烂人起了恻隐之心

一个人都没找到

00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:55,680

00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:05,980

not on paper except for a, uh, trucker's license.

164
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:09,520
勒杜自从那次在假释期间逃掉之后
Ledoux had turned into a ghost

165
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,990
就人间蒸发了
from the time he skipped Parole check.

166
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:16,040
说说看  小伙子们
Tell me, young studs,

167
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:20,090
当你们碰到这种事的时候会怎么做
what would you do when you hit a wall like that?

168
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:25,220
我对这个指控的回应是  我走到那所屋子
Responding to the complaint, I approached the house.

169
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:31,010
看到纱门被打坏了而大门
Seeing that the screen door was broken and the inner door...

170
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:35,440
半开着  我觉得我的进入方式
ajar, I--I felt that entrance

171
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:38,130
遵守了标准程序
Complied with standard procedure.

172
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:43,200
进入屋内后
Upon entering the domicile,

173
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,820
我在茶几上发现了大麻
I noticed what appeared to be marijuana and a white powder

174
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:50,270
和一种白色粉末
on the coffee table.

175
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:56,410
马丁
Hey, Martin.

176
00:08:57,890 --> 00:08:59,070
我们没什么好谈的  丽莎
We don't have to talk, Lisa.

177
00:08:59,070 --> 00:08:59,950
你休想逃避
The hell we don't.

178
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:02,250
你上周不该那么对我
You don't get to do what you did to me last week.

179
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:05,640
对不起  我那天心里难受而且喝多了
Look, I'm sorry. I was hurt and real drunk.

180
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,190
现在跟我说说
Talk to me now.

181
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:11,640
好吧  祝你生活顺利
Ok. Ah, I wish you a great life

182
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:14,000
并且祝你和你的新朋友好运
and good luck with your new friend.

183
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:16,560
你这个玩弄女性的混蛋
You philandering fucking asshole.

184
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,640
听着
Hey, look.

185
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,900
别在这儿大吵大闹的  行吗
There is no pageant to perform, ok,

186
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:23,470
你的失望跟我毫不相干
and your disappointment is irrelevant.

187
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:26,280
你没必要像那天那样  小马
You don't get to act like that, Marty,

188
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,780
或者像现在这样
or like this.

189
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:29,160
事实就是我很高兴知道你们俩在一起了
The fact is it's nice to know you got him,

190
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,410
而且我不想跟你谈论这些
and I don't want to have this conversation with you.

191
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:33,730
你必须要尊重我  小马
You need to respect me, Marty.

192
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:36,060
这就已经是尊重了
This is respect.

193

他听起来很在行

248
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:57,760
在柯萨达那里就有了回旋余地

00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:06,390
你配不上她  别再给她打电话了
She deserves better, and don't call here again.

281
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:07,510
杰克
Jake.

282
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:14,110
你们有过多少前妻
How many exes you guys have?

283
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:18,540
我就是这个意思
I mean, that's what I'm talking about.

284
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:20,930
我做错了吗
Did I make some mistakes?

285
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:22,060
那毋庸置疑
Yes.

286
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:24,500
你知道那个关于侦探的诅咒吗
You know the detective's curse?

287
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:26,750
答案就在眼前
Solution was right under my nose,

288
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:29,020
可却注定专注于错的线索
but I was paying attention to the wrong clues?

289
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:40,400
-待会见  -再见
- See you later. - Bye, hon.

290
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,080
妈的
Damn it.

291
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,490
操
Fuck.

292
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:25,170
雷金·勒杜在哪  快说
Reggie Ledoux. Where is he? Now.

293
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:28,810
要问这个你直接问嘛  至于动手吗
That's what this is about? Yo, man, why didn't you say so?

294
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:30,210
他在哪儿
Where the fuck is he?

295
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:31,900
听说他还在制毒
I--I heard he still cook.

296
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:34,200
听说他出狱后就不再卖货了
I heard he stopped selling after he did his bit,

297
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,200
他现在只为一个客户干
that he only cook for one client now.

298
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:37,310
为谁
Who?

299
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,200
某个摩托车党
Some bike gang.

300
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:42,700
他们定了他所有的货  而且是大宗订单
They buy all his product. Bulk order, no mess.

301
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,430
从俱乐部听来的  没了
I heard this at the clubs is all.

302
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:46,380
所以雷金也不再卖散货了
Reggie don't distribute no more.

303
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:47,740
哪个摩托车党
Which bike club?

304
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:50,500
钢铁英雄还是什么的
Iron Heroes or some shit.

305
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:54,420
钢铁十字军
Iron-Iron Crusaders.

306
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:57,370
就这么个怪名字  我也不懂他们的想法
I don't keep up with them gearheads.

307
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:02,040
钢铁十字军  你确定
Iron Crusaders? You sure?

308
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,390
没错
Yup. Them ones.

309
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:07,980
我就听说他们的货都是雷金弄的
What I heard, Reggie cook their loads and that's all.

310
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:10,460
闭上眼睛数一百
Close your eyes and count to a hundred,

311
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:11,860
谢谢合作
if you can.

312
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:13,710
开始
Go.

313
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,660
1... 2...

314
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:17,230
-大点声  -3
- Louder. - 3!

315
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:20,910
4... 5...

316
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:23,760
我跟威姆斯谈了
Listen I-I talked to Weems and, uh,

317
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:28,940
雷金在为德克萨斯的什么摩托车党干活
the dude is cooking for some motorcycle gang out of texas.

318
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:30,790
帮派叫钢铁十字军
Iron Crusaders.

319
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:33,600
什么  钢铁十字军
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, but--Iron--Iron Crusaders?

320
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:35,170
你确定名字没错吗
You're sure he said Iron Crusaders?

321
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:37,450
我确定
I'm sure he said Iron Crusaders.

322
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:39,840
那我们
So we'll, uh,

323
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:42,370
明天去追查这个帮派的下落吧
We'll chase that tomorrow, yeah?

324
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:45,020
-你现在在哪  -我在忙
- What are you doing right now? - Right now I'm busy.

325
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:54,310
我当时
And, as I recall, I...

326
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:57,060
总得抽时间
I had to take some personal time,

327
00:19:58,410 --> 00:19:59,610
看望父亲
see my dad.

328
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:05,360
那都是  17年前的事了
I mean, this is like, what, 17 years ago?

329
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,580
你们得理解
I mean, you'll have to understand

330
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:12,460
人到中年记忆力会有所减退
if my memory hasn't sharpened in the interim.

331
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,330
-弗兰  电话交给你了  -好的
- Fran, stay by the phone. - I will.

332
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,460
玛姬  我能跟你谈谈吗
Maggie, can I talk to you for just a second?

333
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:28,190
没时间  今天我夜班
No. I'm working graveyard.

334
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:28,960
女儿们在我爸妈那
Girls are with my mom and dad.

335
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,320
留言上都告诉你了  小马
It's all in the note, Marty.

336
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,630
能不能给我个解释的机会
Ok, will you give me a chance to--

337
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,360
她直接来了家里
She came to my home.

338
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,020
当着女儿的面  你这个谎话连篇的混蛋
Our daughters saw her. You lying fuck.

339
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,500
愚蠢可恶
You stupid, lying fuck.

340
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,800
看在上帝份上  听我说  玛姬
Jesus christ. Listen to me, Mags.

341
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:44,780
我那天晚上的话都是真心的
I meant everything I said the other night, every word.

342
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,250
-我真的不再那样了  -拜托
- I-I stopped. - Oh, my god.

343
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:49,800
你觉得你不再出轨这事就算了吗
You think your betrayal's removed by its interruption?

344
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:52,420
她简直令人作呕  你也是
She was disgusting. You're disgusting.

345
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,160
-你没法弥补  -听我说
- You can't fix this. - Listen to me. God, listen--

346
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,080
-放开我  -好的
- Get your hands off me. - Ok.

347
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:59,190
我当时  只是心乱
I-I've been -- I've been a mess.

348
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,690
不知所措了
Rattled. My...

349
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:05,400
因为  我父亲的离世
Just... My dad dying--

350
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,310
拜托  他都死了一年了
Oh, my god. That was a year ago.

351
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:07,070
还有酗酒什么的
And drinking and--

352
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:09,490
我不在乎你的感受了
I don't give a shit about your goddamn feelings.

353
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:12,990
别再干涉我和女儿们的生活了  小马
You need to get out of our lives, Marty, me and the girls'.

354
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:14,420
留言都写的很清楚了
Read the note. It's all there

355
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:15,350
-不许你再来我家  -我不信你忍心
- and you can't come home. - You don't mean that.

356
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:17,550
-你不是认真的  -我是认真的
- You don't mean that. - Yes. Yes, I do

357
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:18,770
听着  我
Listen, I...

358
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,610
我不会让你破坏掉我的家庭的
You are not gonna break up my fuckin' family, ok?

359
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,410
-滚出去  -我不要
- Get out of here right now! - No.

360
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:27,710
打搅一下  你没事吧  玛姬
Excuse me. You all right, Maggie?

361
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:29,110
先生  我建议你离开
Sir, I suggest you leave.

362
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:32,600
没事  大夫  我是州警
Everything's fine, doc. I'm state police.

363
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,560
很好  但你现在是以此身份而来吗
I appreciate that, but are you here in that capacity now,

364
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,150
作为执法人员
as--as law enforcement?

365
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:33,520
你们给我住手
You don't want to do this.

366
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,240
把你们的手拿开  妈的
Get your hands off me, goddamn it,

367
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,940
把你们管事的叫来
and call your commanding officer.

368
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:38,570
-你丢人丢够了  小马  -放屁
- You're making a scene, Marty! - No!

369
00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:41,570
现在还没人丢人  除非这些商场保安想丢人
There is no scene, unless mall patrol here makes one.

370
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:45,090
我在冷静的跟我妻子讨论私人问题
I am calmly discussing a private matter with my wife!

371
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,930
讨论方式有点太醒目了  放松
Private in a pretty public way, man. Easy, easy.

372
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:50,820
-这儿跟你没他妈任何关系  -是的
- This is none of your fuckin' business. - No, no.

373
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:53,090
跟我没关系  但我们有事要做
It's none of my business, but we got to work.

374
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,340
听到了吗  小马
You hear me, Marty?

375
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:55,860
我有一条关于勒杜的线索
I got a line on Ledoux.

376
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,620
我他妈刚弄到
I got it right fuckin' now.

377
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:59,850
我要你一起来  暂时放下这边的烂摊子
I need you to come in, leave this shit till later.

378
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:03,730
我爱你  宝贝
I love you, honey,

379
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,570
我不会放弃的
and I ain't givin' up.

380
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:10,850
走吧
Come on.

381
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:14,540
我们可以找到勒杜  小马  但是会不好收拾
We can get to Ledoux. Marty, it's gonna be dirty.

382
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:18,570
我只想要她再给我一次机会
I just need her to give me another shot.

383
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:21,180
我要是能再有一次机会
If I could just get another shot--

384
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:22,640
我跟你说个事吧
Listen, can I tell you something?

385
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,270
好
Yeah.

386
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:26,840
这跟我没关系
This is none of my business.

387
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:29,120
我不想听
I don't want to hear it.

388
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,030
好吧  抱歉
All right. I'm sorry.

389
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:38,780
你这个混蛋
You total shit.

390
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:42,270
你知道吗  你也有责任
You know, this is part on you, you know?

391
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:44,130
是你就这么插进我的生活
You can't just slide into my life,

392
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:46,230
制造紧张关系  对我指手画脚
creating tensions, judging me--

393
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:49,280
怎么  是我让你去搞年轻版玛姬的吗
What, I make you tap some bimbo, looks like a young Maggie?

394
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:51,130
是我让你到处炫耀这事的吗
I make you flaunt that shit?

395
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:53,730
操  那晚在长角酒吧
Fuck, that night at the Longhorn,

396
00:23:53,730 --> 00:23:56,100
你那么明目张胆盯着她看
you were so obvious, man, checking her out,

397
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:58,590
而她会跟踪你过去就已经够疯得了
and she looked crazy enough to have followed you there.

398
00:23:59,170 --> 00:24:02,290
你吹那么多牛逼  还不知道疯逼什么样吗
With all the dick swagger you roll, you can't spot crazy pussy?

399
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:06,320
是我搞砸了
I fucked up.

400
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:07,990
我只是
I just...

401
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:12,530
我喜欢狂野的东西  一直都是
I like something wild. I always did.

402
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:15,150
我只是  感觉就像
I just... It feels like it--

403
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:18,600
抚平了我生活的其他部分
It smoothes out the other parts of my life most of--

404
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,290
小马  我再说一次  这他妈跟我没关系
Listen, Marty, one more time. It's none of my fuckin' business.

405
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:23,230
我操
Ah, fuck.

406
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:26,650
听着  我们有活儿要干
Look, we got a job to do.

407
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:29,770
私下干  我只能想到这法子
Off-book. That's the only play I can think of.

408
00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:32,360
我得把家里的事情搞定
I--I got to straighten out things with the family.

409
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,470
我得处理好
I got to fix it.

410
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:36,100
那个摩托车党  我认识他们
That bike club. I know 'em.

411
00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:38,400
我做缉毒警的时候跟他们打过交道
I had deals with 'em when I was working narco.

412
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,730
我们可以找到勒杜那个混蛋
We can get to that motherfucker Ledoux.

413
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:45,350
所以  别再来这套自我完善
So, enough with this self-improvement,

414
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:47,230
忏悔  绝望的把戏了
penance, hand-wringing shit.

415
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,660
干活儿吧
Let's go to work.

416
00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:49,820
你觉得你
Do you think you're...

417
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:54,570
我操
Fuck!

418
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:58,080
你还真是会安慰病人啊  拉斯特
Hell of a bedside manner you got, Rust.

419
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,610
蠢和病是两回事
Ah, you know being stupid's different than callin' in sick,

420
00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:02,950
而且这是酒吧  也不是病床
and this is a bar, not a fuckin' bedside.

421
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,080
患难见真情
Friend in need.

422
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,150
每次我以为你已经到顶的时候
Every time I think you hit a ceiling,

423
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:11,000
你都会蹦的更高
you just keep raising the bar.

424
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,440
你就像个混球版迈克尔·乔丹
You are like the Michael Jordan of being a son of a bitch.

425
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:17,290
走吧  你会喜欢我弄到的东西的
Let's go. Come on. Really gonna love this jacket I got.

426
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:23,900
我勒个去
Holy shit.

427
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:26,530
你常去看枪械展吗
You visit a lot of gun shows?

428
00:25:26,530 --> 00:25:27,610
我存着这些枪
Ah, it's just some stuff

429
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:30,190
是为了防止过去惹的麻烦找上门来
I kept in case some work came back on me.

430
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:37,540
那些跟勒杜做交易的人
These boys Ledoux deals to,

431
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,200
是从德州东部来的
they're out of east Texas.

432
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:41,910
我当缉毒警的时候跟他们一起干过
I worked 'em when I was DEA task force.

433
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:46,890
他们知道你是警察吗
They know you're 5-0?

434
00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:48,090
不知道
No.

435
00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:49,450
我不确定
I wasn't sure,

436
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:51,850
所以我问了以前的联络人
so I checked with my old handler.

437
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:54,080
我在卧底的时候
As far as my cover goes,

438
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:58,890
在休斯敦一个港口的缉毒枪战中中了三枪
I took 3 slugs in a DEA shootout in port Houston.

439
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:02,430
所有人都以为我死了
Anybody that gives a shit figures I'm dead.

440
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:05,030
市长说过
Major said

441
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:09,030
缉毒队曾经管你叫克拉什
the task force used to call you Crash.

442
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:13,100
我需要一些私人时间
I'm gonna have to take some personal time

443
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:15,220
小马  大概几周
on this, Marty, a couple of weeks.

444
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:18,420
需要出去  找人打探  找找线索
Got to get out there and get seen, drop some lines.

445
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:21,350
警徽帮不了我们
I mean, badges ain't gonna get us near these people,

446
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:24,040
所以计划是我们给他们点甜头
so the plan is we make 'em an offer...

447
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:28,020
弄清楚他们的供货商
we get a line on their supplier,

448
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:29,710
确定就是勒杜
confirm it's Ledoux,

449
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,040
抓住他
bring him in.

450
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:34,760
我们在做这些事的时候
And then, once we're out there,

451
00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:36,700
只能是我们两个人
all right, it's just you and me on this.

452
00:26:38,290 --> 00:26:39,400
我不喜欢这样
I don't like that.

453
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,140
如果他们发现你的真实身份呢
What happens, they clock you're not you?

454
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:49,950
不行  如果有人看着就做不了我要做的了
No, I can't do what I need to do if we got watchdogs.

455
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:52,350
而且就像你说的  柯萨达会拖我后腿
Besides, like you said, Quesada'd pull me.

456
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:55,130
反正风险也没有那么高
The stakes ain't that high anyway.

457
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:57,930
被发现了不过一枪爆头而已
I get found, I take a bullet to the head.

458
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,730
有个我以前在边境卧底的贩毒集团
This cartel I worked on the border,

459
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,930
他们有个传统
they, uh, they had this routine.

460
00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:09,480
会用胶带把你绑在一个固定在地上的椅子上
They'd duct-tape you to a chair that was bolted to the floor,

461
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,550
缠好几道
use a couple rolls,

462
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,970
确定你一点都动不了
make sure you couldn't budge a fuckin' inch.

463
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:18,250
然后他们会绕着你的脸切
And they'd cut around your face,

464
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:21,070
抓住你的头皮  猛的拉下来
grip your scalp, yank down,

465
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:23,880
把你整个脸都撕下来
rip your face off.

466
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:29,610
然后在你面前放一面镜子
And they'd put a mirror in front of you

467
00:27:29,610 --> 00:27:31,720
让你好好看看自己什么样
so you could get a good look at yourself.

468
00:27:34,090 --> 00:27:36,630
然后切下你的鸡巴和蛋
And they'd cut your dick and your balls off...

469
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:44,690
塞进嘴里  直到你血流不止  噎死为止
shove 'em down your throat until you bled and choked out,

470
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:47,080
还让你看着
while you were watching.

471
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:50,700
所以
So...

472
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:54,100
就高风险而言
as far as high stakes go,

473
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,480
一枪爆头
bullet to the head?

474
00:27:56,190 --> 00:27:57,220
弱爆了
It ain't that.

475
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:03,510
你确定你要这样做吗
You sure you want to do this?

476
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:06,910
不确定
Not exactly.

477
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:31,540
你知道你这里有二楼的吧
Realize you got a upstairs here, right?

478
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:43,940
这是什么
What is that?

479
00:28:45,170 --> 00:28:46,780
墨水和辣椒素
Ink and cayenne.

480
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:50,720
让皮肤发炎  看着像挫伤
Irritates the skin, looks contused.

481
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:54,250
他们让你在边境做了多久
How long they have you out there, working the corridor?

482
00:28:55,570 --> 00:28:56,890
差不多四年
Almost 4 years.

483
00:28:57,430 --> 00:29:00,260
四年  搞什么鬼
4? What the hell?

484
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:03,660
卧底们不应该工作超过11个月
UCs ain't supposed to do more than 11 months.

485
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:08,820
是啊  但是我把任务搞砸了
Yeah, but I--I'd fucked up on the job,

486
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:10,650
为了挽救局势  他们和我一起去了
and to make it better, they went with me.

487
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:15,670
那样的话  很难熬吧
That's a long time, being like that.

488
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:26,090
我需要个快速交易的借口  现在有了
I need a good story to move fast, and I think I got one.

489
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:30,840
现在只需要一些可卡因了
All we need now is some good coke.

490
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:34,010
你打算去哪儿搞
Where you gonna get that?

491
00:29:36,770 --> 00:29:38,020
这你就别担心了
Don't worry about it.

492
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,780
所以你们找到了一个嫌疑人
So you got a suspect,

493
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:45,000
然后请了假
and youu take a leave of absence?

494
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:46,030
是的
Yup.

495
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:48,320
就像我说的  去见我老爸
Like I said, to see my pops.

496
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,100
他得了白血病
Had leukemia.

497
00:29:58,890 --> 00:30:01,770
法夫尔  我来拿证据室的钥匙
Favre. Ahem. I get the evidence key from you?

498
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:04,290
不是说不着急吗
Yeah. Heard you were taking time.

499
00:30:04,290 --> 00:30:05,790
谢谢  今晚就走
Thank you. Leaving tonight.

500
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:07,940
-别忘登记  -好的
- Sign the log. - Yep.

501
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,030
这个应该能看到两只眼睛吗
You supposed to see both eyes in this one?

502
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:00,670
他们真应该把系统搞好点
They really should have a better system for this.

503
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:03,050
我们看了你老搭档的档案
We looked at your old partner's history.

504
00:32:03,050 --> 00:32:06,220
巧合不断  警探
And coincidences keep mounting, detective.

505
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:09,520
什么样的巧合
Oh, coincidences like what?

506
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:12,530
我不确定算不算是巧合  不过
Well, I don't know if it would qualify as coincidence, but,

507
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:15,180
就我们所知  他爸爸从来没得过白血病
near as we could tell, his pops never had leukemia.

508
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:16,650
没有任何医院记录
No hospital records of that.

509
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:18,530
事实上  30年以来  阿拉斯加那个镇上
Fact, nobody in that town in Alaska's

510
00:32:18,530 --> 00:32:20,690
所有人都没见过特拉维斯·科尔
seen Travis Cohle in more than 30 years.

511
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:23,050
所以呢
That it?

512
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:26,620
你还在生你爸爸的气吗
You still angry at him, your pops?

513
00:32:26,690 --> 00:32:27,380
不了
No.

514
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:29,500
他死了
He's dead.

515
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:32,450
但你当时很生气
You were, though.

516
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:34,300
不然你们两个为什么不说话了
I mean, why you two didn't talk.

517
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,880
我们从来没喜欢过对方
We never really liked each other.

518
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,870
这还是有区别的
There's a difference.

519
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:45,000
他去过越南
He was in 'nam.

520
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:48,590
休假的时候在加尔维斯顿遇到了我妈
Met my mother on leave in Galveston.

521
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,540
他回来的时候  我两岁
Time he came back, I was two.

522
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:52,740
她把我丢给了他
She dumped me on him,

523
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:55,810
然后拍屁股走人  我们两个搬到了阿拉斯加
then she hauled ass, and he and I moved to Alaska.

524
00:32:55,910 --> 00:32:59,560
他是个幸存者  可以这么说
He was a survivalist, I guess you'd call it.

525
00:33:01,170 --> 00:33:03,440
有过一些非常奇葩的想法
Had some very fucking strange ideas.

526
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:10,930
没有比那里静谧的夜空更美的事物了
Oh, there's nothing like the night sky out there, though.

527
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:15,580
但是我有点怕冷
But I couldn't handle the cold, so...

528
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:19,480
所以我回到了南德克萨斯  因为我记得
I headed back to South Texas 'cause all I could remember

529
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:22,330
那里至少不冷
was at least it never got cold.

530
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:28,950
我爸经常让我觉得我那么做让他失望了
My old man always made like I let him down that way.

531
00:33:31,890 --> 00:33:33,690
说我毫无忠诚之心
Said I had no loyalty.

532
00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:39,700
趁他们还小  一刀两断是最好的选择
A clean break is best now, while they're still young.

533
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:41,500
听着  那和我无关
Look, that's none of my business.

534
00:33:42,130 --> 00:33:44,860
我想说的是我还需要他的协助
I mean, but I do need him to watch my back on this.

535
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:46,680
所以你们全都变得一团糟
This is how you all get warped.

536
00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:49,870
你们总是低估自己的错误
You always short-change the wrong things.

537
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:51,880
低估
Short-change?

538
00:33:52,810 --> 00:33:53,670
还有什么
What else?

539
00:33:56,230 --> 00:33:59,690
他想让我道个歉  不过这就算了
He wanted me to pass a tide of apologies of which I'll skip...

540
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:03,390
他想见见女孩儿们
and he wants to see the girls,

541
00:34:03,390 --> 00:34:05,120
如果你能安排一下的话
if you can make time for it.

542
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:15,460
孩子们是唯一重要的事  玛姬
Kids are the only thing that matter, Maggie.

543
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:19,500
男女间的这些事都是因为孩子
They're the only reason for this whole man-woman drama.

544
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:21,480
抱歉
I'm sorry.

545
00:34:21,870 --> 00:34:23,660
你到底在说什么
What are you suggesting, exactly?

546
00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:25,890
人会把事情搞砸
Just that people fuck up.

547
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:28,780
我们会变老
We age.

548
00:34:29,430 --> 00:34:30,340
男人和女人
Men, women,

549
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:33,420
除了繁衍后代外不应该发展其它关系
it's not supposed to work except to make kids.

550
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,840
如果你把小马的行为
So, if you can imagine

551
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:42,560
看作是软弱  痛苦的表现
Marty's behavior as an expression of weakness, pain,

552
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:44,660
你就能看出来那并不是因为你
you'd see that it's not about you.

553
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:47,840
到最后  你跟其他人一样
So, end of the day, you duck under rationalization,

554
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,480
拿合理化当挡箭牌
same as any of them.

555
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:52,980
你肯定是一个好丈夫
You must have been a great husband.

556
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:31,590
我露面有差不多一个星期了
People have been seeing me around for about a week.

557
00:35:32,370 --> 00:35:35,390
我打过交道的那个人  今晚想和我见面
Guy I used to run with, he wants to meet me tonight.

558
00:35:35,850 --> 00:35:37,160
如果我能让他落单
Now, if I can get him alone,

559
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:37,870
咱们把他抓起来
we snatch him up,

560
00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:39,940
审讯一下  也许能发现勒杜的线索
work him over, maybe get to Ledoux.

561
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:41,350
{\an8}向东  橘子郡
向西  博蒙特

562
00:35:41,790 --> 00:35:42,930
-好吧  -好吗
- Ok. - All right?

563
00:35:42,930 --> 00:35:43,790
很好
Great.

564
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:46,720
-听着  -电话已经充满电了
- Listen. - Phone's fully charged.

565
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,080
记住  用起来非常简单
And remember, it's real simple.

566
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:50,770
绿色的  接听  红色的  挂断
Green, answers, red, hangs up.

567
00:35:50,970 --> 00:35:51,420
好的
All right.

568
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:52,750
我是唯一一个会打这个电话的人
I'm the only one that's gonna be calling.

569
00:35:53,170 --> 00:35:54,760
-好的  -让它一直充着电
- Yeah. - And keep it charged.

570
00:35:59,330 --> 00:36:00,810
听着  她怎么样
Listen, uh, how was she?

571
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:02,280
她说了什么
What'd she say?

572
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:08,150
她好些了  我能看出来她的态度在软化
She was better. I could see her softening.

573
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,840
她没用D打头的那个词
she didn't use the "D" Word.

574
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,120
我敢打赌  你们两个
My odds, I could see you

575
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:14,460
几个月之内肯定又能在一起了
two back together within a couple months.

576
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:17,000
你真的这么认为吗
That your honest read?

577
00:36:18,730 --> 00:36:20,160
我真的这么认为  小马
That's my honest read, Marty.

578
00:36:44,210 --> 00:36:45,800
听着  我不知道
Look, I don't know

579
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:48,190
我今晚要见的这个人对我有什么想法
how this guy I'm meeting tonight feels about me.

580
00:36:48,190 --> 00:36:49,730
-记住了吗  -那是什么意思
- Ok? - What does that mean?

581
00:36:49,950 --> 00:36:52,060
意思是  今晚如果你失去了我的踪迹
It means, if you lose track of me tonight,

582
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:53,490
拿着这该死的对讲机
keep this fucker handy

583
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:56,870
听博蒙特警方的频道
and be listening to Beaumont police channels.

584
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:58,200
-好的  -记住了吗
- Yeah. - You got it?

585
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,060
记住了
Yeah.

586
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:00,850
真的记住了吗
You got it?

587
00:37:00,990 --> 00:37:02,950
真的  你会没事的对吧
I got it. Are you gonna be all right?

588
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:05,260
但愿
Yeah.

589
00:37:41,950 --> 00:37:43,380
我是克拉什  来找金杰的
Crash, here for Ginger.

590
00:38:14,570 --> 00:38:16,080
在休斯敦之后
Well, after Houston,

591
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:18,340
我去老鹰隘口找了一个医生
I got to a doc in Eagle Pass,

592
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:21,890
然后一个蛇头带我偷渡出境
Then a coyote got me across the border.

593
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,650
之后两年  我在圣米格尔
Past two years, I been working security

594
00:38:24,650 --> 00:38:26,320
为一个小组做安保工作
for a group in San Miguel.

595
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:31,000
警察从来没抓到过我
Feds never ID'd me, you know,

596
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:31,830
所以我觉得
so I figured,

597
00:38:31,830 --> 00:38:34,610
已经过了两年了  风头已过
hell, two years pass, things chill down,

598
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:37,500
我是时候回来了
It's cool for me to come back, stick my head up.

599
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,570
那很难  伙计
That'll be tough, man...

600
00:38:41,410 --> 00:38:43,480
这么长时间以来一直以为你已经死了
Thinkin' you been dead this whole time.

601
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,460
我看起来像死了吗  混账东西
I look dead, motherfucker?

602
00:38:47,290 --> 00:38:48,680
我想继续和你干
I'm lookin' to get with you.

603
00:38:49,730 --> 00:38:50,880
你或者迈尔斯
You or Miles.

604
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,370
迈尔斯不想见到你  克拉什
Miles ain't gonna want to see you, Crash.

605
00:38:54,370 --> 00:38:56,460
-我认为他会想的  -好吧
- Oh, I think he might. - Well, yeah.

606
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,400
那么我换个说法
Then I'd say

607
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:01,200
我不认为你想见到迈尔斯
I don't think you want to see Miles.

608
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:03,680
伙计  我不是来惹事的  好吗
Man, I ain't here to start a thing, all right?

609
00:39:04,890 --> 00:39:06,690
我在墨西哥打交道的那帮人
Boys I been running with in Mexico,

610
00:39:06,690 --> 00:39:09,220
愿意跟我们做笔大的
there could be a hell of a deal for both sides,

611
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:11,080
挣大笔的钱
Fuckin' money to be made.

612
00:39:11,330 --> 00:39:12,230
真真正正的钱
Real money.

613
00:39:13,890 --> 00:39:14,910
是什么行当
What kind of money?

614
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,890
该死的拉斯特
Goddamn Rust.

615
00:39:24,890 --> 00:39:26,150
我操他妈
What the fuck?

616
00:39:55,790 --> 00:39:57,980
我的人已经准备好交易了
My boys are looking to trade, all right?

617
00:39:57,980 --> 00:39:59,440
可卡因换冰毒
Coke for meth.

618
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:09,050
你拿的是什么
What you got there?

619
00:40:09,890 --> 00:40:12,440
-专门给你准备的  -专门给我的
- This one's just for you. - Just for me?

620
00:40:14,430 --> 00:40:15,880
你兑了什么
What'd you cut it with?

621
00:40:15,930 --> 00:40:17,070
你会知道的
Oh, you'll see.

622
00:40:17,370 --> 00:40:18,510
你自己尝
You'll dig it.

623
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:23,700
说来还是不信任我啊
After all I meant to you, huh?

624
00:40:34,070 --> 00:40:36,860
那些人究竟是谁
Now, who exactly are these guys?

625
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:43,670
他  他们
Uh, they, uh...

626
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:46,590
墨西哥军方出来的
Ex-mex army.

627
00:40:46,590 --> 00:40:49,050
跟哥伦比亚那边有关系
They got a Colombian connection.

628
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:52,230
他们在边境的加工厂需要冰毒
They need meth for the maquiladoras.

629
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,890
他们也可以自己生产
Yeah, they could cook it themselves,

630
00:40:54,890 --> 00:40:56,960
可这样会被其他毒贩发现
but then the cartels would take notice,

631
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,140
他们不希望那样
and that ain't what they're lookin' for.

632
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,140
给
Here.

633
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:08,110
尝尝这个  兄弟
Taste that, homie.

634
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,470
真他妈纯
That ain't no fuck-around shit.

635
00:41:18,470 --> 00:41:19,930
我操
Goddamn.

636
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:30,370
你留着吧
You keep it.

637
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:34,100
这东西我那儿多的是
I've got bulldozers' worth of that shit where I came from.

638
00:41:37,690 --> 00:41:39,040
问题是
The thing is...

639
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:42,100
我们有人帮我们制毒
We got one cook.

640
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,020
基本把活全包了
Does all our work, exclusive-like.

641
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:47,750
而且活干得非常好
He's real specific about that.

642
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:51,610
你想我做什么  克拉什  卖给迈尔斯吗
Now, what's this worth to you, Crash, me selling Miles on this?

643
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:54,390
我有个更好的提议  兄弟
Well, I'd got you one better, brother.

644
00:41:56,090 --> 00:41:58,540
我们根本不给迈尔斯
We don't take that shit to Miles at all.

645
00:41:58,990 --> 00:42:00,770
我们自己做供货商
You and me work the supplier,

646
00:42:00,770 --> 00:42:02,910
愿意抽多少都行
the cut's whatever the fuck we want it to be.

647
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:05,120
这可他妈的不容易  兄弟
Now, now, that's tricky shit, bro,

648
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:06,790
我跟你没以前那么熟了
and I don't know you like I used to.

649
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:08,880
我跟你也没以前那么熟
Yeah, I don't know you like I used to, either.

650
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,050
这就是他妈的为什么我要过来
That's why the fuck I'm here.

651
00:42:10,050 --> 00:42:12,000
我来告诉你为什么我会来  克拉什
Well, let me tell you why I came, Crash.

652
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,380
我今晚需要你做点事
I need something from you, tonight.

653
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:16,970
我手下有四个人要干一票大的
I had a 4-man team for a big grab,

654
00:42:16,970 --> 00:42:18,830
其中一个被抓了
lost one to smokies.

655
00:42:18,830 --> 00:42:20,610
我要找人替他
I came looking to replace him,

656
00:42:20,610 --> 00:42:21,890
如果你还干这行的话
if you're still a bad-ass.

657
00:42:21,890 --> 00:42:23,980
我烧杀掳掠  也不抢银行
I don't do A and R, man, no fuckin' bank jobs.

658
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:25,110
不是那种事
It ain't nothin' like that.

659
00:42:25,110 --> 00:42:26,750
我需要一个听话的
I need a good soldier.

660
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:29,020
跟我们干这票
Now, you do this with us,

661
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:31,870
我就帮你牵线
we talk about puttin' you with my man.

662
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:32,890
听着
Look.

663
00:42:33,710 --> 00:42:35,740
我不当牛仔很多年了  金杰
I don't ride cowboy no more, Ginger.

664
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:37,680
我不做你说的这种
Oh. I don't do this small-time shit

665
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,830
屁大的事了
like this thing you're talking about, all right?

666
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,970
你他妈在南部让人阉了吧
What, you get neutered down south, huh?

667
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:46,000
我很享受这法外的生活
I embrace the outlaw life.

668
00:42:47,110 --> 00:42:49,050
你还穿着这身呢
Now, you dress the part still.

669
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,460
还是说你在演戏
That just an act?

670
00:42:53,030 --> 00:42:54,840
也许是吧
When in rome, brother,

671
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:57,910
不过我很会收拾残局
but I do clean up real fuckin' pretty.

672
00:43:00,270 --> 00:43:02,510
操他娘的  我需要个神枪手
Motherfucker, I need a gunslinger.

673
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:05,700
别那么胆小了  跟我干吧
Now, you ain't too timid, get on this shit with me.

674
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:08,940
这样才好谈合作
Then we can talk about doin' business.

675
00:43:12,810 --> 00:43:14,060
在哪
Where?

676
00:43:16,350 --> 00:43:17,730
我那儿
My place.

677
00:43:20,790 --> 00:43:22,380
河口下面
Down the bayou.

678
00:43:23,370 --> 00:43:25,020
好吧  我开车过去
All right. I got my truck.

679
00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:26,760
这里很安全
It'll be safe here.

680
00:43:31,870 --> 00:43:33,080
仅限会员
Members only.

681
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:35,800
我来找我朋友
I'm just lookin' for a friend.

682
00:44:12,830 --> 00:44:14,240
你他妈的干嘛
Hey. What the fuck?

683
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:16,310
听我说  我朋友不在这里
Look, look, look, my buddy's not here.

684
00:44:16,310 --> 00:44:18,490
-你没听到吗  -我是他的监护人
- You ain't listening! - I'm his sponsor, and

685
00:44:18,490 --> 00:44:20,650
我担心他又开始酗酒了
I'm worried that he might have started drinking again.

686
00:44:20,650 --> 00:44:22,530
你应该担心我们会不会把你脑袋揪下来
You better worry that we don't pull your head off

687
00:44:22,530 --> 00:44:24,010
往你脖子里拉屎
and shit down your neck!

688
00:44:24,010 --> 00:44:25,410
他戒酒二十年了
