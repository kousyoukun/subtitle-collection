{\an8}真探
前情提要

18
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:03,190
而是我们有事没做完
We left something undone.

19
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:04,450
我们必须做完
We got to fix it.

20
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:07,080
那是我们在伊拉斯查的案子
You and I were on the case in Erath.

21
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:09,640
有个女孩说她被一个长着绿耳朵的意面怪
Girl comes forward and says she was chased through the woods

22
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:12,140
追进了树林
by a spaghetti monster with green ears.

23
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:16,530
我觉得那就是脸上有伤疤的那个男人
Now, I think that this is our man with the scars on his face.

24
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:18,790
比利·李·塔特尔怎么了
What happened to Billy Lee Tuttle?

25
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:20,890
我观察了他的房子好几周
I staked his places out for weeks.

26
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:22,670
在那里的保险箱里找到了那些
Found those in the safe there.

27
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,310
有一卷录像带
There's a videotape.

28
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:26,680
不
No!

29
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:30,190
在所有这些东奔西跑的孩子们中
Out of all these kids running around

30
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:31,900
有没有个孩子
you remember one that maybe had

31
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:35,050
脸下边可能有道疤
scars all across the bottom of his face?

32
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:37,810
那是山姆先生的孙子吧
I think that was Mr. Sam's grandchild.

33
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:40,060
能帮我确认件事吗  一件事
Could you have a look at something for me? ne thing.

34
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:41,890
你知道卡寇莎
You know Carcosa?

35
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:44,990
我又调查了下玛丽·方特诺特
Did some backtracking on the Marie Fontenot stuff.

36
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:47,450
治安官并没有投诉她
Sheriff didn't take the original complaint,

37
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:48,970
是代理治安官做得
deputy did.

38
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,700
史蒂夫·杰瑞西
Steve Geraci.

39
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,050
我把能想起来的全说了
I said all I remember about the girl.

40
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:54,250
别再问了
And don't ask again

41
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:55,610
我不会再问你
I ain't gonna ask you.

42
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:56,780
他会
He is.

43
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:28,810
{\an8}真探
第一季第八集[季终]

44
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:49,060
苍蝇变多了
Them flies are gettin' thick.

45
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:52,520
应该给你好好冲一冲了
Somebody ought to give you a good hosin'.

46
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,720
靠温度是没用的
Heat ain't helpin'.

47
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,530
看来你还能再活一天
Eh, reckon you'll keep another day.

48
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:04,360
乖一点  我中午给你带点水来
Be good, I'll bring you some more water round noon.

49
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,640
再见  爸爸
Bye, Daddy.

50
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:37,470
拜托  别咬
Come on. Come on.

51
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:39,350
别咬
Come on.

52
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:53,390
我有今晚剧院的票
But I have tickets for the theater this evening,

53
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:55,820
是我一直想看的一场表演
to a show I was looking forward to, and I get, well,

54
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:58,160
我遇到些不太合理的事情
kind of unreasonable about things like that.

55
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,910
如此专业的表演
With such expert play-acting,

56
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:01,520
你使得这个演播厅如同剧院一般
you make this very room a theater...

57
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,480
你去散步了吗
You have a good walk?

58
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,430
去了  亲爱的
Yes, my dear.

59
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:09,470
今早最棒的散步
Top-notch walk this morning.

60
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:14,220
最棒的运动
Top-notch constitutional.

61
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:21,520
自从我留下印记已经都几个星期了
It's been weeks since I left my mark.

62
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:24,600
他们去看了吗
Would that they had eyes to see.

63
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:28,200
你能不要把比莉小姐带进来吗
Don't you get Miss Billie in here with them dirty feet!

64
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:38,070
不好意思啊  老伙计
Sorry, old chap.

65
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:59,140
你今天要做爱吗
You want to make flowers today?

66
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,610
贝蒂  我现在
Now, Betty,

67
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:05,400
有很重要的事要做
I have very important work to do.

68
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,530
我
My...

69
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:11,950
已接近飞升之境
ascension removes me from the disc and the loop.

70
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,590
我就要到最后阶段了
I'm near final stage.

71
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,020
有时候的早上
Some mornings,

72
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,380
我能看到飞往地狱的飞机
I can see the infernal plane.

73
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:25,470
你已经大约有三个星期没有跟我做爱了
You haven't made flowers on me for maybe 3 weeks.

74
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:28,010
让我非常难过
Makes me sad is all.

75
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:33,480
来我腿上坐着  小姑娘
Ah, come up in me lap, lass.

76
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:38,020
这里来  让我安慰你的痛苦
Here, and let me comfort ye in your distress.

77
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:41,080
你重新使我开心起来来
You're make fun of me again.

78
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:43,290
不  我为什么要这么做呢
No, why'd I do a thing like that, huh?

79
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:46,760
因为你特别机灵吗
Is it because you're ne so bright?

80
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:50,020
因为你的总是呆呆的吗
Because of your head bein' so slow and like?

81
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,590
快放我走  不然你会欲火焚身的
Oh, you better let me go 'cause I'm burn your eggs.

82
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:08,310
能跟我说说爷爷吗
Couldn't you tell me about Grampa?

83
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:24,140
我在甘蔗田里
I was in the cane fields,

84
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:27,920
趁我单独一人的时候他抓住了我
and he caught me when I was alone.

85
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:31,950
泥土很温暖
And the dirt was warm.

86
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:35,100
我感到暖暖的泥土触着我背
I felt the dirt warm on my back.

87
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:46,780
{\an8}克里奥尔自然步道
还有160公里

88
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:58,320
要是我得说第二遍的话你的膝盖骨就不保了
You're gonna lose a kneecap if I got to ask you again.

89
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,620
把它从袋子里拿出来放进录像机里
Take it out of the bag and put it in the machine.

90
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:24,850
别看我
Don't look at me.

91
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:26,770
看屏幕
Look at the TV.

92
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,740
天呐
Oh, Jesus Christ.

93
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,610
你为什么给我看这个
Why are you showing me this?!

94
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:05,180
这小女孩就是你说的去看她爸爸的那个
That little girl is the one you said went to see her daddy.

95
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:07,910
玛丽·方特诺特  大约在1990年
Marie Fontenot, circa 1990.

96
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,140
我上交过一份失踪青少年报告
I took a m-missing juvenile report.

97
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:19,590
当我回过头去跟进的时候
And when I went back to follow up on it,

98
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:23,550
这份文件上写着"报告有误"
the file said, "report made in error."

99
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:26,120
我没这么写过
I never wrote that.

100
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:30,680
我带着它去找了治安官  泰德·柴尔德里斯
So I marched it right in to the sheriff, Ted Childress.

101
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,180
他已经去世了
He's dead now.

102
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:34,100
是他写的
He did it.

103
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,370
治安官怎么说
What'd the sheriff say?

104
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:38,460
他说是他改的
He said he'd changed it,

105
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:41,060
他认识这孩子的父母
that he knew the mother and the father,

106
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,930
叔叔和婶婶
the aunt and the uncle.

107
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:46,750
这事就是侄女从他这儿搬走了之类的
It was a niece once removed from him or somethin'.

108
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:49,170
这就是行政系统
It was the chain of command.

109
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,220
没法改变
No reason to change it.

110
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:54,880
我只是照上级的要求做
I just... follow what the big man says.

111
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:56,890
就是...
It's...

112
00:08:58,430 --> 00:08:59,920
这么一回事
how this all works.

113
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:03,350
我试着去找孩子的母亲
I--I tried to get back with the mother.

114
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,860
我试着去找她
I tried to get back with her.

115
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,800
她不见了  她走了
She was gone! She split!

116
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:08,710
文件不见了
The file was gone!

117
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:10,670
却没人提起
Nobody said a word!

118
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:13,300
后来  我在泰德的推荐下
Later that year, I was in State CID,

119
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,940
当了州属刑事调查员
on Ted's recommendation!

120
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:17,810
我没有什么理由重新去查证
Nobody ever gave me a reason to second-guess it!

121
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,860
这就是行政系统
It's chain of command!

122
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:23,000
对吗
Right?

123
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:27,320
你觉得呢
What do you think?

124
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,740
我觉得他没说谎
I don't think he's lying...

125
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,230
就他所知的这些
as far as he knows.

126
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,360
就我所知的这些
As far as I know?

127
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:38,830
你他妈是怎么回事  伙计
What the fuck is with you, man?!

128
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:40,360
如果我们稍作安排
Might be a whole lot safer

129
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,180
可能会更安全  小马
if we staged something, Marty...

130
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,810
把玛莎拉蒂推到护栏外
sent the Maserati over the guardrail.

131
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,640
孩子们  慢点跑
Boys, slow down.

132
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,960
在外面小心点
Be careful out there.

133
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:25,970
你要是饿了  我从自助餐厅给你拿份午餐来
I can get you a cafeteria lunch if you're hungry.

134
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:28,200
没事的  小姐
That's all right, Miss.

135
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:30,490
我得继续工作
I've got to get on with my work.

136
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:32,590
今天事很多
Lots to do today.

137
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:34,050
好吧
Oh, all right.

138
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:01,440
我们把你的手机和枪拿走
We're gonna hang onto your phone and your gun

139
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,490
等确保没事了就立刻寄给你
till we get safe and mail them to you once we know we are.

140
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:05,940
有问题吗  史蒂夫
That work for you, Steve?

141
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:08,410
当然他娘的没问题
You can bet your ass it doesn't.

142
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:11,480
而且你要叫我杰瑞西治安官  白痴
And it's Sheriff Geraci to you, shitheel.

143
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,100
史蒂夫
Now, look, Steve,

144
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:15,120
你想摆平这些操蛋事
you're gonna want to swing some dick on this thing.

145
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,410
我告诉你几条不行的原因
I'm gonna give you a couple reasons why you won't.

146
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:20,300
首先  我们在你的地盘找到这盘录像带
First off, we found this tape in your possession.

147
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:23,420
上面有你曾说没失踪的那个小姑娘的视频
It's a video of the little girl that you said was not missing.

148
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:26,170
第二  所有的发现都在律师手里
Second off, all findings are with lawyers,

149
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:29,270
准备寄给媒体  联邦探员
ready to be forwarded to media outlets, feds,

150
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:31,340
刑事调查员和美国检察官
CID, U.S. Attorneys,

151
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:33,910
要么我们中的一位会拿到逮捕令
should either one of us get sworn a warrant

152
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,390
要么就彻底地人间蒸发
or if either one of us just fall off the face of the fuckin' earth,

153
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:38,880
像你那个地区的人所希望的那样
as people are want to do in your neck of the woods.

154
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:41,480
所以你还是想想那个小姑娘吧  史蒂夫
So you just think about that little girl, Steve.

155
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:47,030
那你的船呢
What about your boat?

156
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,130
那不是我的船
That ain't my boat.

157
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,670
-你知道是谁的吗  -我以前从来没见过
- You know whose boat that is? - I never seen it before.

158
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:57,610
你们会遭报应的  一群混蛋
It's gonna come back on you, you assholes,

159
00:11:58,090 --> 00:11:59,410
一定会遭报应的
one way or another.

160
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:01,710
想想那个小女孩吧  史蒂夫
You just think about that little girl, Steve.

161
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:04,520
相当长一段时间我都会想你的  拉斯特
For quite some time, I'm gonna be thinking about you, Rust.

162
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,640
还有一件事  史蒂夫
Hey, one other thing, Steve.

163
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,530
我找了个狙击手老朋友
Got an old sniper pal, all right?

164
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:10,720
酬金已经付清了
Contract's already been paid.

165
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:12,450
你总有一天会落到我们手上的
Me or Marty,

166
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:13,380
等着你的不是手铐就是棺材
we see cuffs or coffins,

167
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:15,110
你将会死得毫无尊严
you're gonna end up in the dirt.

168
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,050
然后你的名声将会一塌胡涂
Then we're gonna smear your name.

169
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:20,330
我也给你准备了点东西  小子
I got something coming for you, baby.

170
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:23,550
你的恐吓对我完全没用
Your psycho bit don't cur me, boy!

171
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,440
你听到没有
You hear me?!

172
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:33,720
这他妈怎么回事
What the fuck?!

173
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:47,130
你说我这是空谈者还是行动派  史蒂夫
I strike you as more of a talker or a doer, Steve?

174
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:49,210
这他妈是我的车
That's my fuckin' car!

175
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:50,620
真他妈该死
God damn it!

176
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,570
为生活干杯  死胖子
L'chaim, fatass.

177
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:55,720
你这个婊子养的
You motherfuckers!

178
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:57,660
我操你妈
Fuck you!

179
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:11,010
{\an8}亨利·塔特尔和吉尔·塔特尔

180
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:08,340
那个柴尔德里斯治安官
This old Sheriff Childress.

181
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:11,390
他没有小孩  也没有任何亲属信息
He's got no kids, no location on any of his relatives.

182
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:15,130
你觉得他们有没有可能把出生证明销掉了
You think they could have wiped out birth records?

183
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:16,710
我觉得有可能
I don't see why not.

184
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:19,920
沿海的医院有一半都不在了
I mean, half those hospitals along the coast are gone now.

185
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:24,040
我们在亲属这条线
You know, we got a dead end

186
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:26,420
貌似陷入死胡同了
on the relations and, uh,

187
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:28,280
你手上还有什么
what else is there?

188
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,080
案情档案
Case files.

189
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,710
你想看98年之前的还是之后的
You want pre-'98 or after?

190
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:34,990
之后的
After.

191
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:39,910
我们必须换个新角度看这些记录  小马
We're gonna have to be looking at these records with fresh eyes, Marty.

192
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:42,380
就像我们对此案毫不知情一样
All right? Like we're totally green.

193
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,770
为什么会是绿耳朵
Why green ears?

194
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,800
假设那是我们要找的人
I mean, assuming that's our guy.

195
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:10,240
我不知道  不确定
I don't know, exactly.

196
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,170
我猜可能
My thinking was it was probably

197
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:14,670
有点靠谱吧  你懂的
leaves of some kind, you know,

198
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:17,200
我们确实知道他穿过树林袭击了她
'cause we do know that he came at her through the woods.

199
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:27,560
怎么了  你在想什么
Why? What you thinking?

200
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:34,030
在找95年朵拉·兰在伊拉斯拉票的照片
Looking for '95 Dora Lange canvassing photos from Erath.

201
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,300
为什么
Why?

202
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:37,860
这个...
Well...

203
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:58,520
拉斯特
Rust.

204
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:00,510
过来
Come over here.

205
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:06,660
你觉得  当时  那个...
Now, you think, back then, does that--

206
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,040
那个你觉得...
does that look like a fresh...

207
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:11,520
像新刷的油漆吗
paint job to you?

208
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:20,670
-绿耳朵  -对
- The green ears. - Yeah.

209
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,840
也许是油漆沾到帽子上了
Maybe they were sticking out of his hat.

210
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:25,520
也许他是刷的那栋房子
Maybe he painted that house.

211
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:33,890
我去查查旧地址
I'm going to look up old addressees.

212
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:42,970
可以啊  兄弟
Fuck you, man.

213
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:59,560
有些事10年来一直困扰着我
Something's been bugging me the last 10 years.

214
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:02,400
不是每天  时不时的
Not every day, just now and then.

215
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:04,410
我们打了一架
We went at it,

216
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:06,070
你辞职那天
day you quit.

217
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:09,060
你让着我了吗
Were you holding back?

218
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,000
没有  我怎么可能让着你
No, I don't see how I could've.

219
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:14,530
你知道
Oh, yeah, you do.

220
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:16,990
你一直都有那种...
You--you've always had such

221
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:19,790
自己的膨胀意识
an inflated idea of yourself.

222
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:21,610
什么意思
Meaning what?

223
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:24,620
意思看起来很他妈自大
Meaning it seems pretty damn arrogant

224
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:27,930
跟我打架让着我也很可能
to hold back in a fight with me.

225
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:31,600
你觉得你能打倒我吗
You think you could have put me down?

226
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:35,020
我不知道
Ah, I don't know.

227
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:36,640
我可能会杀了你
Hell, I'd have had to kill you.

228
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:38,700
你当时太愤怒了
You were so goddamn mad.

229
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:43,330
是  没错
Yeah, um...ahem.

230
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:47,550
她告诉我时  她说
You know, when she told me, she said

231
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:51,630
不要怪你  那不是你愿意的
not to blame you, that it wasn't your choice.

232
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:53,530
你...喝多了  而且...
You, uh, were drunk and...

233
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:55,580
是她主动的
she made it happen.

234
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:58,900
每个人都有选择  小马
Everybody's got a choice, Marty.

235
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:01,390
操  我觉得得怪你
Shit, I sure blamed you.

236
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:03,430
怪我  为什么
Blamed me? For what?

237
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:05,720
因为你把一个好女人
For pushing a good woman

238
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:08,550
逼到利用我和我们的搭档关系
to the point where she had to use me,

239
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:11,450
才能摆脱你的程度
use our partnership to get rid of you.

240
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:14,860
因为你是个撒谎的混蛋
For just being a lying sack of shit.

241
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:19,880
如果不是你也有意  她也不会找上你
You know, she couldn't have used you, you didn't want some.

242
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:21,020
果然说到这了
There you go.

243
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:24,270
每个人都有选择
Everybody's got a choice.

244
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:29,790
而且  她依然关心你
And yet, she still cares about you.

245
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:32,740
你当时去找她了  我猜
You went to see her, I take it.

246
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:36,210
-而她来了酒吧  -什么
- She came out to the bar. - What?

247
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,940
-什么时候  -她来看看你
- When? - Yeah, she was just checking on you,

248
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:41,270
想要确保我没把你扯进任何麻烦里
wanted to make sure I wasn't getting you in any trouble.

249
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,440
你不应该告诉我
You should have fuckin' told me.

250
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,730
也许吧  我猜
Yeah, maybe. I guess.

251
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:51,050
我想最好连她的名字都不要提
I reckoned it was best to just avoid her name.

252
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:54,300
不想被审判  你从来不喜欢被人指手画脚
Didn't want to invite judgments. You never liked being judged.

253
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,610
是的  你说的对  不喜欢  特别是被你
No, you're right, I don't. Not by you.

254
00:17:56,890 --> 00:17:58,540
我什么都没说
Well, I didn't say a word.

255
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:00,980
我从你脸上的表情就能看出来
Well, I could read it all over your face.

256
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:03,340
问题在于你的脸
Well, then the problem's with your face,

257
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:04,840
而不是我的
not mine.

258
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:11,070
你知道吗  对于你这样拒人于千里之外的人
It's hard to find something in a man

259
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:14,080
很难跟你有什么共同语言
who rejects people as much as you do, you know that?

260
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,980
我从来没教过你怎么生活  小马
I never told you how to live your life, Marty.

261
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:19,370
不不不  你只是居高临下批判别人
No, no, no, you just sat in judgment.

262
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:21,340
我们作为有知觉的肉体
Look, as sentient meat,

263
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:24,990
不管我们的身份多么虚幻
however illusory our identities are,

264
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:28,270
也是通过价值判断来塑造的
we craft those identities by making value judgments.

265
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:31,010
每个人都会评判别人  一直都这样
Everybody judges, all the time.

266
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:35,110
你要质疑这点  你就没活对
Now, you got a problem with that, you're living wrong.

267
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:41,940
什么叫"有知觉的肉体"
What's "Scented meat"?

268
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:04,870
有什么能帮忙的吗
Can I help you?

269
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,730
95年的时候你们住在这里吗
Did you happen to live here back in '95?

270
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,440
不  那会儿我们不住这里
No, we didn't live here back then.

271
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:12,780
这是我奶奶家
This is my grandma's place.

272
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:14,480
你奶奶  她在我们这儿吗
Grandma, she still with us?

273
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,810
-你是问她还活着吗  -是的
- Alive, you mean? - Yeah.

274
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:17,990
活着呢  住在阿比维尔的
Yeah, she's in an old folks' place.

275
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:18,990
养老院
Abbeville.

276
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,640
希尔夫人
Mrs. Hill, now,

277
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,860
接下来的问题可能有点匪夷所思
this is a very strange question,

278
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:32,970
但你还记得94或95年冬天的事吗
but, um, do you remember back in the winter of '94 or '95,

279
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:34,920
你的房子重新刷漆了吗
did you get your house painted?

280
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,620
刷了  没错  我刷了
I did. Yes, I did.

281
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:41,410
很漂亮的绿色漆
A nice green.

282
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:44,070
但我记不起那颜色叫什么了
Don't remember what they call it anymore.

283
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:46,190
你还记不记得
Do you happen to remember

284
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:48,370
谁给你刷的房子
who it was that painted your house?

285
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:49,730
记得

跟你没关系
None of your fucking business.

355
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:20,990
你的老搭档告诉过你什么吗
Your old partner give you anything yet?

356
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:23,380
和你毫无关系

361
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:35,050

366
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:44,980

369
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:51,570
跟科尔以前的想法有关吗
It's about Cohle's theory, way back?

370
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:53,370
他和你合作
He's fucking with you.

371
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:56,840
他是个操纵者  一个反社会的人
He's a manipulator, sociopath.

372
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:57,870
你知道的
You know this.

373
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:03,140
你了解山姆·塔特尔家族
Do you know about Sam Tuttle,

374
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:05,990
的所有分支吗
all the branches of the family?

375
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,940
比如  沼泽文化
The, uh, marsh cult,

376
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:11,890
恶魔崇拜  儿童献祭什么的
devil worship, child sacrifices?

377
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:13,960
你听起来很像科尔
You sound like Cohle.

378
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,310
线索似乎指向除了他以外的所有方向是吗
It points in every direction but him, huh?

379
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:18,760
我就知道你要那么说
Man, I knew you were gonna say that.

380
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,820
你知道一些事  但不想告诉我
You know something, you're obstructing.

381
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:21,840
我们不确定
We don't know,

382
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:24,120
但我们有一个想法
but we're following up an idea.

383
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,720
也许是错的  但是
May be nothing, but--

384
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:31,000
一段时间之后  我们发现了些事情
ahem--time comes, we--we know we got something,

385
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:33,570
如果你拿到线索  会做正确的事吗
you get a call, you gonna do the right thing?

386
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,730
你说了一个谜语  白人
You speak in Riddles to me, white man.

387
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:40,000
你的话又像科尔了
You sound like Cohle, again.

388
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:41,370
我们发现了一些事  你想要线索
We get something, do you want the call

389
00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:43,500
还是想让线索落进别人手里
or you want it to go to someone else?

390
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,360
给我吧
Give it to me.

391
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:54,910

That taste.

393
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:42,870

What?

394

铝  铝灰
Aluminum, ash.

395
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:49,750
我以前尝过
I've tasted it before.

396
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,620
你还有幻觉吗
You still see things, ever?

397
00:25:57,910 --> 00:25:59,900
从没真正消失过
It never stops, not really.

398
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:04,170
我脑袋受的刺激  是不会好起来的
What happened to my head, it's not something that gets better.

399
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:11,520
快到了
Uh, this is it.

400
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:55,900
给帕帕尼亚打电话
Call Papania.

401
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:58,800
该死  没信号
Shit. Can't get a signal.

402
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:01,870
我去借座机
I'm gonna ask to use the phone.

403
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:06,970
这样吧  还是我去吧
You know what? I'll go ask.

404
00:27:09,410 --> 00:27:10,230

This is the place.

不好意思  太太
Oh, pardon me, ma'am.

409
00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:53,460
我们是专业测量员
Uh, we're professional surveyors

410
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:57,110
可是像初学者似的  在小路上迷失方向了
and got lost on these back roads like a couple of greenhorns.

411
00:27:57,270 --> 00:27:59,980

Is there any way that I could, uh,

413
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,510
借用你的座机

414
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:06,870
我们没有座机  先生
We don't have no phone, Mister.

415
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,010
-那可太郁闷了  -是啊

418
00:28:13,370 --> 00:28:15,390
能否麻烦你给我一杯水

419
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:21,880
这附近的水不是很好
The water around here is not real good.

420
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:25,150
坐下  别叫了  否则我踢你了
Sit, I said! Stop it! I'm gonna kick you!

421
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,000

萦绕在我们周围

我看见他了  小马

修剪草坪

我看不出他有多高
I couldn't tell how tall he was

536

540
00:45:52,010 --> 00:45:53,160
还有漏网之鱼
We didn't get 'em all.

541
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:56,090
那也在所难免
Yeah, and we ain't gonna get 'em all.

542
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:58,540
世界就是这样  至少我们抓到了我们的犯人
That ain't what kind of world it is, but we got ours.

543
00:46:02,710 --> 00:46:04,340
我不该躺在这的
I'm not supposed to be here.

544
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:12,770

死性不改
Don't ever change, man.

547
00:47:49,060 --> 00:47:50,660
医生说
Doc said, uh,

548
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:52,180
可能还得再待两天
probably get out in a few days.

549
00:47:52,180 --> 00:47:55,850
我会帮你弄辆车  找个住的地方
I'll make sure you got a ride, place to stay.

550
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:57,470
我自己会搞定的

551
00:47:58,270 --> 00:48:00,590
已经搞定了
Well, it's already been figured out.

552

给你带了件礼物
I brought you something.

554
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:10,870
我们这是要订婚了吗
Are we getting engaged?

555
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:13,710
那要是求婚戒指  我会包装得更好点的
If we were getting engaged, I'd have got a nicer ribbon.

556
00:48:20,060 --> 00:48:22,080
你居然还记得
You remembered.

557
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:23,310
是啊
Yeah.

558
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:26,400
别在这待着了
Ah, let's get out from under this roof, huh?

559
00:48:26,510 --> 00:48:27,580
同意
Good idea.

560
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:32,210
我自己可以推轮椅的
Hey, I can push two goddamn wheels on my own.

561
00:48:32,210 --> 00:48:33,420
没错  我应该让你自己来
Yeah, I ought to let you

562
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:35,960
然后再把缝线扯开  闭嘴吧
and rip out your fuckin' stitches. Stop it.

563
00:48:38,780 --> 00:48:41,590
感觉好点了吗  头上的伤
Feeling better? Your head, I mean.

564
00:48:44,930 --> 00:48:47,590
我不想再呆在这了  小马
I shouldn't even fuckin' be here, Marty.

565
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:51,850
我觉得没人
I believe "No shit" is the proper response

566
00:48:51,850 --> 00:48:53,490
是乐意住院的
to that observation.

567
00:48:54,190 --> 00:48:55,890
我不是说住院
Nah, I don't mean like that.

568
00:48:56,550 --> 00:48:57,760
是别的事
It's something else.

569
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:02,590
那跟我说说呗  拉斯特
Well, so... talk to me, Rust.

570
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:12,490
有那么一刻
There was a moment --

571
00:49:13,170 --> 00:49:15,580
当我陷在黑暗之中时
I know when I was under in the dark

572
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:16,590
有什么东西
that something...

573
00:49:18,310 --> 00:49:20,320
不管我是深陷于什么之中
whatever I'd been reduced to,

574
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:22,570
甚至没有知觉
you know, not even consciousness.

575
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:26,340
那是一种在黑暗里的模糊意识
It was a vague awareness in the dark,

576
00:49:26,570 --> 00:49:27,550
我可以
and I could--

577
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:32,300
我可以感觉到我整个人
I could feel my definitions

578
00:49:32,870 --> 00:49:33,830
正在消逝
fading.

579
00:49:35,370 --> 00:49:38,710
而在那黑暗之下  还有另外一种感觉
And beneath that... darkness, there was another kind.

580
00:49:38,710 --> 00:49:41,010
更深层次的
It was--it was deeper,

581
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:45,630
很温暖  就像是真的一样
warm, you know, like a substance.

582
00:49:47,990 --> 00:49:50,030
我可以感觉到
I could feel, man,

583
00:49:50,590 --> 00:49:54,190
我知道  我知道我的女儿
and I knew, I knew my daughter

584
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:57,130
在那里等着我
waited for me there.

585
00:49:57,730 --> 00:49:58,940
清楚万分
So clear.

586
00:49:59,470 --> 00:50:00,640
我可以感觉得到她
I could feel her.

587
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:04,630
我可以感觉到
I could feel...

588
00:50:06,230 --> 00:50:09,810
我还可以感觉到一点我爸爸的存在
I could feel a piece of my--my pop, too.

589
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:14,790
就像是我在所有我
It was like I was a part of everything

590
00:50:14,790 --> 00:50:18,080
深爱过的人之中  我们全都在
that I ever loved, and we were all...

591
00:50:19,940 --> 00:50:22,590
我们三个人  都在慢慢消逝
the 3 of us, just-- just fadin' out.

592
00:50:26,450 --> 00:50:29,460
而我只要放手就行了
And all I had to do was let go...

593
00:50:31,530 --> 00:50:32,530
我也确实这么做了
and I did.

594
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:37,370
我说"黑暗"
I said, "Darkness, yeah, yeah."

595
00:50:39,950 --> 00:50:41,590
然后我就消失了
And I disappeared.

596
00:50:44,180 --> 00:50:47,040
但是我仍然可以  可以感觉到
But I could-- I could still feel

597
00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:49,680
她对我的爱意
her love there,

598
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:53,350
浓于以前
even more than before.

599
00:50:55,630 --> 00:50:56,590
只有
Nothing...

600
00:51:01,790 --> 00:51:03,630
只有爱意紧紧包围着我
There was nothing but that love.

601
00:51:16,910 --> 00:51:18,090
接着我醒了
Then I woke up.

602
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:37,320
你不是有一次吃晚饭的时候告诉过我
Didn't you tell me one time at dinner

603
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,730
有这么一次
once, maybe, about you used to...

604
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:45,490
你以前会编点星空的故事
you used to make up stories about the stars?

605
00:51:47,930 --> 00:51:48,980
是的  那是
Yeah, that was--

606
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:50,300
那是
that was, um,

607
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:53,670
我在阿拉斯加州的时候
in A-Alaska,

608
00:51:54,460 --> 00:51:56,750
在浩瀚夜空之下
under the--under the night skies.

609
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,290
你躺在那儿  往天上看
Yeah, you used to lay there and look up,

610
00:52:00,180 --> 00:52:01,880
遥望星空
yeah, at the stars?

611
00:52:04,030 --> 00:52:05,960
没错  你还记得我
Yeah, and you remember I...

612
00:52:06,590 --> 00:52:09,180
我17岁之前都没看过电视
I never watched a TV till I was 17,

613
00:52:09,180 --> 00:52:11,000
所以平时没什么可做的
so there wasn't much to fuckin' do out there

614
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,620
只能到处走走看看  以及
besides walk around and explore and--

615
00:52:13,690 --> 00:52:14,730
以及
And...

616
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:19,480
以及仰望星空  编点故事
and look up at the stars and make up stories.

617
00:52:20,180 --> 00:52:21,270
比如呢
Like what?

618
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:27,030
跟你说吧  小马  我每天晚上
I tell you, Marty, I've been up in that room

619
00:52:27,030 --> 00:52:30,480
都在房间里看着窗外  想着
looking out those windows every night here and just thinking...

620
00:52:37,460 --> 00:52:38,730
这不过就是个故事
It's just one story.

621
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:41,770
最老的故事
The oldest.

622
00:52:46,180 --> 00:52:47,090
是什么
What's that?

623
00:52:49,980 --> 00:52:51,720
光明与黑暗之战
Light versus dark.

624
00:52:57,770 --> 00:53:00,470
我知道我们不在阿拉斯加  但是
I know we ain't in Alaska, but...

625
00:53:01,780 --> 00:53:05,900
看起来黑暗占了上风
appears to me that the dark has a lot more territory.

626
00:53:10,270 --> 00:53:11,210
是啊
Yeah.

627
00:53:12,690 --> 00:53:14,040
你说得对
You're right about that.

628
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:21,350
听着
Hey, listen, hey.

629
00:53:21,350 --> 00:53:22,670
怎么
Yeah, what?

630
00:53:22,980 --> 00:53:26,790
带我去车上吧
Why don't you point me in the direction of the car, man?

631
00:53:27,380 --> 00:53:29,830
我这辈子在医院里待得够久的了
I've spent enough of my fuckin' life in hospitals.

632
00:53:30,690 --> 00:53:33,720
上帝啊
Jesus. Oh. You know what?

633
00:53:33,830 --> 00:53:35,500
我虽然不赞成
I'd protest,

634
00:53:35,970 --> 00:53:38,940
但是看起来你还死不了
but it occurs to me that you're unkillable.

635
00:53:39,790 --> 00:53:41,690
你要回去穿点衣服吗
You want to go back, get clothes or anything?

636
00:53:41,690 --> 00:53:45,100
不用了  留在那儿的东西都不要了
No, anything I left back there, I don't need.

637
00:53:51,030 --> 00:53:55,370
你知道  关于天空  你弄错了
You know, you're looking at it wrong, the...sky thing.

638
00:53:56,590 --> 00:53:57,600
为什么
How is that?

639
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:01,870
以前  这个世界只有黑暗
Well, once, there was only dark.

640
00:54:04,340 --> 00:54:06,650
要我说  是光明占了上风
If you ask me, the light's winning.
