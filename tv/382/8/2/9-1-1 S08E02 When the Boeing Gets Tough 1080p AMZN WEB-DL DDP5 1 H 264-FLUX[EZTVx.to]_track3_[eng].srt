1
00:00:07,593 --> 00:00:10,044
What? We're not in first class?

2
00:00:10,044 --> 00:00:12,081
Win the tourney,
maybe on the way back.

3
00:00:12,081 --> 00:00:13,841
I'd settle for coach plus.

4
00:00:13,841 --> 00:00:16,568
Well, tell Mitch I'm
not gonna go over five percent.

5
00:00:16,568 --> 00:00:18,225
He wants nine?
What is he, high?

6
00:00:18,225 --> 00:00:20,330
Okay, tell him
we'll give him six and a half.

7
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:22,574
Yeah, six and a half,
and that's my final offer.

8
00:00:22,574 --> 00:00:24,921
Yeah. Okay. Bye.

9
00:00:24,921 --> 00:00:26,923
Hi. Who is this? Hello.

10
00:00:26,923 --> 00:00:28,062
Oh.

11
00:00:28,062 --> 00:00:29,753
He doesn't like men.

12
00:00:29,753 --> 00:00:31,100
Wonder where he gets that from.

13
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:36,277
All right, come on, buddy.
Eyes on where we're going.

14
00:00:36,277 --> 00:00:37,968
I think we're...

15
00:00:41,662 --> 00:00:43,284
Welcome aboard, son.

16
00:00:43,284 --> 00:00:44,768
Skytrain A80.

17
00:00:44,768 --> 00:00:46,425
Wide-body twin-jet aircraft.

18
00:00:46,425 --> 00:00:48,255
Same fuselage
and wing components

19
00:00:48,255 --> 00:00:50,084
as the A90 variants.

20
00:00:50,084 --> 00:00:51,741
Yeah, that's right.

21
00:00:51,741 --> 00:00:53,432
Oh, Jem likes planes.

22
00:00:53,432 --> 00:00:54,744
I can see that.

23
00:00:54,744 --> 00:00:56,642
- Have a great flight.
- You, too.

24
00:00:58,265 --> 00:00:59,473
She's so pretty.
- Thank you.

25
00:00:59,473 --> 00:01:01,233
Yeah, that's a great companion.

26
00:01:01,233 --> 00:01:04,478
And we are off to meet
our new grandchild.

27
00:01:04,478 --> 00:01:06,135
Our fifth.

28
00:01:06,135 --> 00:01:07,619
Beautiful girl.

29
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:10,277
- He is.
- Yeah.

30
00:01:10,277 --> 00:01:11,623
This is Renee.

31
00:01:11,623 --> 00:01:13,383
How full are we?

32
00:01:13,383 --> 00:01:15,247
We pick up
a few dozen more in L.A.

33
00:01:15,247 --> 00:01:16,317
Let's close 'er up, then.

34
00:01:16,317 --> 00:01:17,767
Copy that.

35
00:01:20,494 --> 00:01:21,771
Wait! Wait!

36
00:01:21,771 --> 00:01:24,808
Welcome aboard, and aloha.

37
00:01:24,808 --> 00:01:27,328
We're not going to Hawaii.
We're getting off in L.A.

38
00:01:27,328 --> 00:01:29,468
Well, still, you just made it.

39
00:01:29,468 --> 00:01:31,470
Must be your lucky day.

40
00:01:33,127 --> 00:01:35,371
Okay, right there.

41
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:38,167
You got the window.

42
00:01:38,167 --> 00:01:41,446
Um, I really don't fly well.

43
00:01:41,446 --> 00:01:45,484
I-I don't like looking down
from 40,000 feet.

44
00:01:45,484 --> 00:01:47,037
Then don't look down.

45
00:01:47,693 --> 00:01:51,421
He's coming to. Cap?
- Cap, you still with us?

46
00:01:51,421 --> 00:01:55,322
I'm good.
Let's get back to work.

47
00:01:55,322 --> 00:01:56,426
You're okay, Cap.
Try not to get up.

48
00:01:56,426 --> 00:01:58,014
Try not to get up, all right?

49
00:01:58,014 --> 00:02:00,154
You had a close shave
from a razor this big.

50
00:02:00,154 --> 00:02:04,193
Left eye's normal.
Right pupil's still sluggish.

51
00:02:04,193 --> 00:02:05,608
Possible concussion.

52
00:02:05,608 --> 00:02:07,610
Let's get him to the ER.

53
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:09,059
He's gonna kill me.

54
00:02:09,059 --> 00:02:11,855
No, no, he's gonna fire me
and then he's gonna kill me.

55
00:02:11,855 --> 00:02:13,685
Why? You save his life.

56
00:02:13,685 --> 00:02:15,894
Is that what I did?

57
00:02:15,894 --> 00:02:17,689
Honestly, I-I don't really know

58
00:02:17,689 --> 00:02:19,622
because I just wanted
to hit the guy.

59
00:02:21,071 --> 00:02:24,282
Uh, if you want, I could try
to buff that out for you.

60
00:02:24,282 --> 00:02:26,836
I think we're good.
Let's go, let's go.

61
00:02:29,356 --> 00:02:31,703
S-Stop, w-we're good.

62
00:02:31,703 --> 00:02:33,705
- I-I got it.
- Yeah, not to worry, Cap.

63
00:02:33,705 --> 00:02:34,740
They're taking you
to the hospital

64
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:36,225
just to run some routine tests.

65
00:02:36,225 --> 00:02:38,192
And a four-inch hose!
Copy that.

66
00:02:38,192 --> 00:02:39,918
All right, let's get him in.

67
00:02:48,582 --> 00:02:51,378
So I guess that makes you
the acting captain.

68
00:02:51,378 --> 00:02:52,758
Any orders, Cap?

69
00:02:54,726 --> 00:02:56,176
All right.

70
00:02:56,176 --> 00:03:00,663
As acting captain
while Gerrard is incapacitated,

71
00:03:00,663 --> 00:03:03,700
my first order of business is...

72
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:05,944
A dance party.

73
00:03:05,944 --> 00:03:07,117
Let's go.

74
00:03:09,327 --> 00:03:11,915
Next time a buzz saw
comes gunning for me,

75
00:03:11,915 --> 00:03:14,608
I hope you're close by.

76
00:03:24,825 --> 00:03:27,897
Emmett Washington died
living his purpose,

77
00:03:27,897 --> 00:03:31,590
protecting and serving,
taking care of his community.

78
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:34,110
And that's what
he would want us to do,

79
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:37,458
to take care of each other
at this terrible time.

80
00:03:37,458 --> 00:03:41,428
To say a few words
of remembrances, Athena Carter,

81
00:03:41,428 --> 00:03:43,637
Emmett's fiancée.

82
00:03:46,329 --> 00:03:47,986
Thank you.

83
00:03:52,991 --> 00:03:54,820
For Emmett...

84
00:03:55,821 --> 00:03:58,410
...being a police officer
wasn't just a job...

85
00:04:00,032 --> 00:04:02,000
...it was a calling.

86
00:04:03,001 --> 00:04:05,624
Every day of his life
was given to that calling.

87
00:04:06,591 --> 00:04:10,629
Emmett was the one who inspired
me to become a police officer.

88
00:04:11,837 --> 00:04:14,806
And for that...

89
00:04:14,806 --> 00:04:16,808
I am forever grateful.

90
00:04:18,499 --> 00:04:21,468
Grateful that Emmett came
into my life.

91
00:04:22,469 --> 00:04:27,543
Grateful for his love
and commitment.

92
00:04:28,509 --> 00:04:31,995
Not just to me,
but to the city of Los Angeles

93
00:04:31,995 --> 00:04:33,721
and to this department.

94
00:04:35,378 --> 00:04:37,656
The best thing
we can do to honor him

95
00:04:37,656 --> 00:04:39,658
is continue the work.

96
00:04:41,384 --> 00:04:44,698
I will always honor Emmett.

97
00:04:50,704 --> 00:04:54,294
And I will always love him.

98
00:04:55,985 --> 00:04:59,160
<i>All units, clear the air
for priority traffic.</i>

99
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:05,960
<i>Dispatch calling 237,</i>

100
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,342
<i>Officer Washington.</i>

101
00:05:08,342 --> 00:05:11,138
<i>This is the final call</i>

102
00:05:11,138 --> 00:05:14,175
<i>for 237...</i>

103
00:05:15,384 --> 00:05:18,559
<i>...Officer Emmett Washington.</i>

104
00:05:18,559 --> 00:05:23,046
<i>Officer Washington is 10-7.</i>

105
00:05:23,046 --> 00:05:27,913
<i>Thank you for your dedication,
service and loyalty.</i>

106
00:05:27,913 --> 00:05:30,088
<i>You can rest easy.</i>

107
00:05:31,123 --> 00:05:33,367
<i>We have the watch from here.</i>

108
00:05:37,923 --> 00:05:40,063
I've been thinking about it.

109
00:05:40,063 --> 00:05:42,376
I'm not gonna take the deal.

110
00:05:42,376 --> 00:05:43,860
What?

111
00:05:45,137 --> 00:05:47,588
I'm not taking
the early release deal.

112
00:05:50,557 --> 00:05:54,043
You make me drag my ass
all the way to Arizona

113
00:05:54,043 --> 00:05:56,252
and now you decided
that you're not gonna cooperate?

114
00:05:56,252 --> 00:05:59,082
I'm going to cooperate.

115
00:05:59,082 --> 00:06:01,015
I'm just...

116
00:06:01,015 --> 00:06:02,396
I'm not gonna take the deal.

117
00:06:02,396 --> 00:06:04,605
Not unless I have your blessing.

118
00:06:05,951 --> 00:06:08,126
I don't even know
what to say to that.

119
00:06:08,126 --> 00:06:10,404
You don't have to say anything.

120
00:06:17,549 --> 00:06:18,757
Why don't you tell me

121
00:06:18,757 --> 00:06:22,140
why men in suits
are trying to kill you?

122
00:06:26,558 --> 00:06:29,872
You know who Maxwell Fulton is?

123
00:06:29,872 --> 00:06:33,565
Beverly Hills money manager
and grade-A pedo.

124
00:06:34,566 --> 00:06:36,396
Well, as of a few months ago,

125
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:38,674
I had never even
heard of the guy.

126
00:06:39,847 --> 00:06:42,609
<i>The U.S. Attorneys' Office
came to me with an offer.</i>

127
00:06:42,609 --> 00:06:45,543
<i>Switch prisons,
cozy up to the guy</i>

128
00:06:45,543 --> 00:06:47,303
<i>and see if he
would confide in me.</i>

129
00:06:47,303 --> 00:06:48,718
As per what we discussed,

130
00:06:48,718 --> 00:06:50,444
his name is Maxwell Fulton.

131
00:06:50,444 --> 00:06:51,963
We're looking for names
of people he's protecting

132
00:06:51,963 --> 00:06:54,310
and people
who are protecting him.

133
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:55,622
<i>Well,</i>

134
00:06:55,622 --> 00:06:57,347
<i>getting to know
Maxwell was easy enough</i>

135
00:06:57,347 --> 00:07:01,075
<i>because everybody else in
the prison had shunned the dude</i>

136
00:07:01,075 --> 00:07:02,974
<i>because he was a
child molester</i>

137
00:07:02,974 --> 00:07:06,564
<i>I was the only one to stoop
low enough to speak to him.</i>

138
00:07:06,564 --> 00:07:07,979
Delightful.

139
00:07:07,979 --> 00:07:10,568
Yeah, okay,
well, anyway, eventually...

140
00:07:10,568 --> 00:07:12,466
Maxwell and I were like this.

141
00:07:12,466 --> 00:07:15,918
And it made me
sick to my stomach, a lot.

142
00:07:15,918 --> 00:07:17,471
Did he name names?

143
00:07:17,471 --> 00:07:19,266
Not at first.

144
00:07:19,266 --> 00:07:22,683
After he got shivved,
he opened up a little bit.

145
00:07:22,683 --> 00:07:25,617
<i>The Brotherhood
tried to whack him.</i>

146
00:07:27,343 --> 00:07:28,758
<i>And they did
a pretty good job, too,</i>

147
00:07:28,758 --> 00:07:30,864
<i>except Maxwell survived.</i>

148
00:07:30,864 --> 00:07:32,141
Help!

149
00:07:32,141 --> 00:07:34,281
Six weeks in the infirmary...

150
00:07:34,281 --> 00:07:35,696
Wake up. Wake up.

151
00:07:35,696 --> 00:07:36,939
<i>...when he came back to me,</i>

152
00:07:36,939 --> 00:07:38,527
he was an open book.

153
00:07:38,527 --> 00:07:39,976
I have to tell you something,

154
00:07:39,976 --> 00:07:41,599
something that
nobody else knows--

155
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:45,879
in case they come at me again--
where my library is.

156
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:47,363
Everyone I ever filmed,

157
00:07:47,363 --> 00:07:49,952
everyone I set a girl up with,

158
00:07:49,952 --> 00:07:51,229
I put it in one place.

159
00:07:51,229 --> 00:07:54,128
Maxwell said there were
people on the outside

160
00:07:54,128 --> 00:07:56,510
who would and could do anything

161
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:59,375
to get their hands on
what he called "his library."

162
00:07:59,375 --> 00:08:01,653
So he told you
where he put it all, hmm?

163
00:08:01,653 --> 00:08:05,933
If I tell you,
then the target's on your back.

164
00:08:13,872 --> 00:08:16,634
Okay. You sit tight.

165
00:08:16,634 --> 00:08:18,187
I'm gonna talk to the captain,

166
00:08:18,187 --> 00:08:20,534
make sure LAPD
is at the gate for us.

167
00:08:22,122 --> 00:08:24,158
Ma'am, we just
began our descent.

168
00:08:24,158 --> 00:08:25,574
If you could retake your seat.

169
00:08:25,574 --> 00:08:27,576
I need to speak to the pilot.
It's urgent.

170
00:08:27,576 --> 00:08:29,267
I can't let you in there.

171
00:08:29,267 --> 00:08:30,786
The phone is fine.

172
00:08:33,616 --> 00:08:34,997
Checklist complete.

173
00:08:34,997 --> 00:08:37,586
Continue descent. I'm 10-1.

174
00:08:39,242 --> 00:08:40,554
<i>This is Captain Dominguez.</i>

175
00:08:40,554 --> 00:08:42,176
Captain, there is
a police sergeant here

176
00:08:42,176 --> 00:08:43,281
who'd like to speak to you.

177
00:08:43,281 --> 00:08:45,248
All right.
I was coming in anyway.

178
00:08:45,248 --> 00:08:46,664
Left turn, 30 degrees...

179
00:08:46,664 --> 00:08:48,251
<i>Traffic. Traffic. Climb. Climb.</i>

180
00:08:48,251 --> 00:08:49,563
- Pull up!
- Pulling up!

181
00:08:49,563 --> 00:08:51,047
<i>Traffic. Climb. Climb.</i>

182
00:08:56,432 --> 00:08:58,434
<i>Traffic. Traffic. Climb. Climb.</i>

183
00:08:59,953 --> 00:09:03,094
<i>Traffic. Traffic. Climb. Climb.</i>

184
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:47,069
<i>Danger. Reduce altitude.</i>

185
00:09:47,069 --> 00:09:49,589
Hey! Hey!

186
00:09:50,555 --> 00:09:51,521
<i>Danger.</i>

187
00:09:51,521 --> 00:09:52,730
Hey!

188
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:53,731
<i>Reduce altitude.</i>

189
00:09:53,731 --> 00:09:55,905
<i>Danger. Reduce altitude.</i>

190
00:09:55,905 --> 00:09:57,769
<i>Reduce altitude.</i>

191
00:09:57,769 --> 00:10:00,151
What can I do? What can I do?

192
00:10:00,151 --> 00:10:01,739
<i>Reduce altitude.</i>

193
00:10:01,739 --> 00:10:03,154
<i>Danger. Reduce altitude.</i>

194
00:10:03,154 --> 00:10:04,396
Okay.

195
00:10:30,526 --> 00:10:31,803
Mayday! Mayday!

196
00:10:31,803 --> 00:10:33,667
Emergency, emergency!

197
00:10:49,821 --> 00:10:52,203
Keystar 63, do you read? Over.

198
00:10:52,203 --> 00:10:53,722
895-Alpha, do you copy?

199
00:10:53,722 --> 00:10:55,551
They were in a landing pattern
and climbed suddenly,

200
00:10:55,551 --> 00:10:57,035
then leveled
to under 10,000 feet.

201
00:10:57,035 --> 00:10:58,036
Now they're not responding.

202
00:10:58,036 --> 00:10:59,728
I just lost 895-Alpha.

203
00:10:59,728 --> 00:11:00,729
Light aircraft.

204
00:11:00,729 --> 00:11:02,213
He said something about bees

205
00:11:02,213 --> 00:11:03,732
and then dropped off the radar.

206
00:11:03,732 --> 00:11:04,871
Can you repeat that?
I'm having

207
00:11:04,871 --> 00:11:06,182
a little trouble
hearing you, ma'am.

208
00:11:06,182 --> 00:11:09,392
Maybe it's because
the window's open!

209
00:11:09,392 --> 00:11:11,222
- Are you driving?
<i>- No.</i>

210
00:11:11,222 --> 00:11:14,570
Flying.

211
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:16,227
Keystar Flight 63

212
00:11:16,227 --> 00:11:17,573
<i>out of Phoenix.</i>

213
00:11:17,573 --> 00:11:18,919
<i>There's been an accident!</i>

214
00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:20,921
A midair collision.

215
00:11:20,921 --> 00:11:22,889
Our radio here is busted.

216
00:11:22,889 --> 00:11:24,580
Can I have your name?

217
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:26,582
<i>Athena Grant.</i>

218
00:11:26,582 --> 00:11:29,550
<i>I need air traffic.</i>

219
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:31,069
Air traffic,

220
00:11:31,069 --> 00:11:32,415
I have LAPD Sergeant

221
00:11:32,415 --> 00:11:34,245
Athena Grant,
passenger on Keystar

222
00:11:34,245 --> 00:11:37,110
<i>Flight 63, putting her through
to you now.</i>

223
00:11:38,456 --> 00:11:41,804
Flight 63, this is Nick Johnson,
Air Traffic Control.

224
00:11:42,874 --> 00:11:44,634
<i>Are you there, Flight 63?</i>

225
00:11:44,634 --> 00:11:46,706
<i>Again, this is Air Traffic
Control, Nick Johnson.</i>

226
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,431
Nick, we're in trouble up here.

227
00:11:48,431 --> 00:11:49,847
We hit something.

228
00:11:49,847 --> 00:11:51,538
We know, a light plane.

229
00:11:51,538 --> 00:11:53,022
<i>Yeah, not light enough.</i>

230
00:11:53,022 --> 00:11:54,610
Our captain's missing,

231
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:56,129
I'm guessing...

232
00:11:56,129 --> 00:11:58,614
sucked through
the hole that's...

233
00:11:58,614 --> 00:12:00,271
<i>that's in this cockpit.</i>

234
00:12:00,271 --> 00:12:04,033
There's a-a jump seat
in it right now.

235
00:12:04,033 --> 00:12:05,621
Who stabilized the aircraft?

236
00:12:05,621 --> 00:12:07,209
<i>Our copilot.</i>

237
00:12:07,209 --> 00:12:09,107
He's alive but unconscious.

238
00:12:09,107 --> 00:12:10,730
<i>He's in bad shape.</i>

239
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:11,765
<i>All right.</i>

240
00:12:11,765 --> 00:12:13,974
I need you to look
on the instrument panel,

241
00:12:13,974 --> 00:12:15,286
just below the windshield.

242
00:12:15,286 --> 00:12:17,322
<i>Do you see a button
that says AP?</i>

243
00:12:17,322 --> 00:12:19,877
Uh... uh...

244
00:12:19,877 --> 00:12:21,948
I do, yes.

245
00:12:21,948 --> 00:12:24,122
<i>- Is it lit?</i>
- Yes.

246
00:12:24,122 --> 00:12:27,470
Good. Your autopilot is engaged.

247
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:29,507
Sergeant Grant,
this is Amy Olson,

248
00:12:29,507 --> 00:12:31,164
Air Traffic Supervisor.

249
00:12:31,164 --> 00:12:33,304
We're clearing
the airspace around you,

250
00:12:33,304 --> 00:12:36,272
so there's nothing out your
window you need to worry about.

251
00:12:36,272 --> 00:12:37,964
<i>The aircraft will stay
in the sky.</i>

252
00:12:37,964 --> 00:12:39,828
<i>Oh, that's encouraging.</i>

253
00:12:39,828 --> 00:12:42,485
<i>For now, just sit tight,
keep your phone near you.</i>

254
00:12:42,485 --> 00:12:43,797
We'll get back to you
at this number

255
00:12:43,797 --> 00:12:45,350
as fast as we can
with a game plan.

256
00:12:49,182 --> 00:12:50,666
We are rolling.

257
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:52,599
Turn off your
cell phones, please.

258
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:55,844
Action!

259
00:12:55,844 --> 00:12:58,536
Cap, you better give
a listen here.

260
00:12:58,536 --> 00:13:01,677
Help me, help me. I'm in here.

261
00:13:01,677 --> 00:13:04,266
Owners said they just retiled
the bathroom floor yesterday.

262
00:13:04,266 --> 00:13:06,130
And no one's seen
the plumber since.

263
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:10,030
Hmm. All right, everyone,
stand back.

264
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:11,825
I'm gonna Roto-Rooter
this guy out

265
00:13:11,825 --> 00:13:13,793
the old-fashioned way.

266
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:15,104
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Can we cut?

267
00:13:15,104 --> 00:13:16,519
What now?

268
00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:18,004
Uh, I'm-I'm sorry, everybody.

269
00:13:18,004 --> 00:13:19,350
It's just... first,

270
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:20,938
you'd never swing
that thing anywhere near

271
00:13:20,938 --> 00:13:22,871
where the victim might be
because you could hurt him.

272
00:13:22,871 --> 00:13:24,942
- I mean,
you could even kill him.
- Hey, tech advisor.

273
00:13:24,942 --> 00:13:27,047
- Yeah.
- It's a TV show, not reality.

274
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:30,050
Copy that.
So, if it's a TV show

275
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:31,362
and you have to use
a sledgehammer,

276
00:13:31,362 --> 00:13:32,742
you want to remember
that you're hitting

277
00:13:32,742 --> 00:13:33,882
- into tile.
- Yeah.

278
00:13:33,882 --> 00:13:35,642
And sharp shards of porcelain

279
00:13:35,642 --> 00:13:37,851
could come flying back at you,
so you'd put your visors down

280
00:13:37,851 --> 00:13:39,404
or you might go home blind.

281
00:13:39,404 --> 00:13:41,199
They're not putting
their visors down,

282
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:43,753
because then the audience
won't see their faces.

283
00:13:43,753 --> 00:13:45,307
And this is
not actual porcelain.

284
00:13:45,307 --> 00:13:47,861
It's plaster of paris. Not real.

285
00:13:47,861 --> 00:13:50,795
But we want it to look real,
don't we, Marcus?

286
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:55,420
I need my script.

287
00:13:56,905 --> 00:13:59,217
- I think maybe
that guy hates me.
- Uh, don't worry about it.

288
00:13:59,217 --> 00:14:00,218
He'll be gone
by the end of the week,

289
00:14:00,218 --> 00:14:02,255
off to another show, but you...

290
00:14:02,255 --> 00:14:03,601
you'll still be here.

291
00:14:10,263 --> 00:14:11,540
I think that's good.

292
00:14:12,299 --> 00:14:14,094
Looks like
the bleeding's stopped.

293
00:14:14,094 --> 00:14:16,165
Blood pressure's holding.

294
00:14:16,165 --> 00:14:19,272
- 95/65.
- Well, he's alive.

295
00:14:19,272 --> 00:14:20,860
Now I need him alive and awake.

296
00:14:22,275 --> 00:14:25,105
We have a lot
of injured people out here.

297
00:14:25,105 --> 00:14:26,555
And another problem...

298
00:14:32,216 --> 00:14:33,907
That's not good.

299
00:14:33,907 --> 00:14:36,910
No. It's not.

300
00:14:38,981 --> 00:14:40,293
All right.

301
00:14:40,293 --> 00:14:43,123
All these people back here
are getting upgraded.

302
00:14:43,123 --> 00:14:44,469
Move everyone as far away

303
00:14:44,469 --> 00:14:46,264
from the tear as possible.

304
00:14:46,264 --> 00:14:47,645
Okay. Let's go, guys.

305
00:14:47,645 --> 00:14:49,440
Go, go, go, go.

306
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,718
Go up. Let's go. Let's go.

307
00:14:51,718 --> 00:14:54,272
Let's go. Move up.
Go, go, go, go, go.

308
00:14:55,653 --> 00:14:57,275
Watch your head.

309
00:15:00,451 --> 00:15:03,212
If I could just have
everyone's attention.

310
00:15:03,212 --> 00:15:07,768
My name is Athena Grant,
I'm a sergeant with the LAPD.

311
00:15:07,768 --> 00:15:10,806
I've been in touch
with people on the ground.

312
00:15:10,806 --> 00:15:13,222
They are aware of our situation

313
00:15:13,222 --> 00:15:15,121
and are working on a solution.

314
00:15:15,121 --> 00:15:17,123
What is our situation?

315
00:15:17,123 --> 00:15:18,676
What was that?

316
00:15:19,849 --> 00:15:22,852
Our plane was involved
in a midair collision.

317
00:15:22,852 --> 00:15:26,856
But I'm told that we're
in no danger of going down.

318
00:15:26,856 --> 00:15:30,446
I know that you're all scared.

319
00:15:31,378 --> 00:15:34,002
I won't tell you not to be
because I am, too.

320
00:15:35,175 --> 00:15:37,764
But the important thing now
is that we help each other

321
00:15:37,764 --> 00:15:39,939
and not panic.

322
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:43,701
Now, who has cell service?

323
00:15:44,702 --> 00:15:47,498
You guys think it's weird we
haven't heard from the hospital?

324
00:15:47,498 --> 00:15:51,847
Nah, Presbyterian's
always late this time of day.

325
00:15:51,847 --> 00:15:53,987
I'll tell you what's weird.

326
00:15:53,987 --> 00:15:55,506
Gerrard's not sitting
in that chair

327
00:15:55,506 --> 00:15:57,991
yelling at us through egg salad.

328
00:16:04,722 --> 00:16:06,275
Hey, Maddie.
<i>Hey.</i>

329
00:16:06,275 --> 00:16:08,864
We're taking the 118 out of
rotation for the rest of shift.

330
00:16:08,864 --> 00:16:10,452
Is this about that thing
with Gerrard?

331
00:16:10,452 --> 00:16:12,350
- 'Cause Hen's got that covered.
<i>- No.</i>

332
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:14,111
I have some people on the line
who need to talk to you.

333
00:16:14,111 --> 00:16:16,009
- To me?
<i>- To all of you.</i>

334
00:16:16,009 --> 00:16:17,528
Put me on speaker, I'll explain.

335
00:16:18,529 --> 00:16:19,530
Okay.

336
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:22,360
Hey, guys, it's Maddie.

337
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,880
<i>Hi, everyone. I need your help</i>

338
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,882
with multiple casualties
from a midair collision.

339
00:16:26,882 --> 00:16:28,918
We're nowhere near the airport.

340
00:16:28,918 --> 00:16:30,713
Neither are they.
They're still midair.

341
00:16:30,713 --> 00:16:32,992
<i>ATC's working
on bringing them down.</i>

342
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,821
<i>For now, I'm gonna patch them
through to each of you</i>

343
00:16:34,821 --> 00:16:36,236
individually for triage.

344
00:16:36,236 --> 00:16:37,824
Why us?

345
00:16:37,824 --> 00:16:39,101
<i>Because you're their best hope.</i>

346
00:16:40,689 --> 00:16:42,587
And because Athena's
on that plane.

347
00:16:49,732 --> 00:16:51,320
<i>You've reached Bobby Nash.</i>

348
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,081
<i>I'm not available
to take your call right now.</i>

349
00:16:53,081 --> 00:16:54,599
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

350
00:16:57,775 --> 00:16:58,983
Bobby...

351
00:17:05,714 --> 00:17:07,440
I love you, baby.

352
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:14,688
Please, tell me you've
come up with a plan.

353
00:17:14,688 --> 00:17:16,897
I've got some
hurting people up here.

354
00:17:16,897 --> 00:17:18,451
<i>We think we have, Sergeant.</i>

355
00:17:18,451 --> 00:17:21,454
Okay. I'd love to hear it.

356
00:17:21,454 --> 00:17:23,732
<i>You're gonna land the plane.</i>

357
00:17:23,732 --> 00:17:27,046
I'm gonna land the plane?

358
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:29,220
That is not a great plan.

359
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:30,428
We've contacted
a flight instructor.

360
00:17:30,428 --> 00:17:31,636
He's on his way here.

361
00:17:31,636 --> 00:17:33,086
<i>He'll coach you through it.</i>

362
00:17:33,086 --> 00:17:34,467
Coach me through it?!

363
00:17:34,467 --> 00:17:36,262
<i>He's actually done this
many times.</i>

364
00:17:36,262 --> 00:17:37,539
When?

365
00:17:37,539 --> 00:17:40,300
With students.
On a flight simulator.

366
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:43,062
It's essentially the same thing.

367
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:44,649
Except on a simulator,

368
00:17:44,649 --> 00:17:46,306
when you make a mistake,
you get another chance.

369
00:17:46,306 --> 00:17:49,102
There are people on this plane!

370
00:17:49,102 --> 00:17:51,829
And you're gonna get them
all home safely.

371
00:17:53,037 --> 00:17:55,246
You know, there's something
else that you should know.

372
00:17:55,246 --> 00:17:58,077
There's a hole in the plane.
Another one.

373
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:01,597
<i>In the back. A piece of
the plane that hit us</i>

374
00:18:01,597 --> 00:18:04,152
is sticking right
through the roof.

375
00:18:05,498 --> 00:18:08,156
You should move people away
from that if you can.

376
00:18:08,156 --> 00:18:10,813
Already done.
<i>Terrific.</i>

377
00:18:10,813 --> 00:18:13,161
Then you-you should be fine.

378
00:18:13,161 --> 00:18:16,233
Should we evacuate the airport?

379
00:18:16,233 --> 00:18:17,510
Maybe.

380
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,033
No, no! You listen to me.

381
00:18:24,033 --> 00:18:26,933
You come near her again,
and I mean even the same state,

382
00:18:26,933 --> 00:18:29,970
you even glance in her
direction, and I will know.

383
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:32,180
And the next time
you happen to lower your guard

384
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:33,802
just for one moment,

385
00:18:33,802 --> 00:18:36,253
just know that I'm gonna take
that moment to end your bloody,

386
00:18:36,253 --> 00:18:38,393
pathetic lif--

387
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:40,671
Hello, Bobby, mate.

388
00:18:40,671 --> 00:18:42,604
Sandy, Sandy,
I've got to call you back,

389
00:18:42,604 --> 00:18:44,053
darling, yes.
Somebody's, uh,

390
00:18:44,053 --> 00:18:45,331
just shown up.

391
00:18:45,331 --> 00:18:47,333
All right, darling.
Toodle-oo. Bye.

392
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:49,335
- You good? Okay.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I was just, uh...

393
00:18:49,335 --> 00:18:51,337
- Doing a scene?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

394
00:18:51,337 --> 00:18:53,270
- But not for this. Sit down.
- Yeah. All right.

395
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:55,479
Not for this.
Been rehearsing for a play.

396
00:18:55,479 --> 00:18:56,997
- Okay.
- Yeah, I wrote it.

397
00:18:56,997 --> 00:18:59,172
Uh, I cowrote it.
That was my writing partner.

398
00:18:59,172 --> 00:19:01,864
Have you seen the movie <i>Platoon?</i>

399
00:19:01,864 --> 00:19:03,038
<i>Platoon?</i>

400
00:19:03,038 --> 00:19:04,522
Is that with,
uh, Wilford Brimley

401
00:19:04,522 --> 00:19:06,869
at the retirement center
and the aliens take him away?

402
00:19:06,869 --> 00:19:08,354
That's <i>Cocoon. Platoon's--</i>

403
00:19:08,354 --> 00:19:09,872
Vietnam. Oliver Stone. Yeah.

404
00:19:09,872 --> 00:19:11,184
I remember, I just,
I was making a joke.

405
00:19:11,184 --> 00:19:14,463
Oh, the deadpan, seen-it-all
irony kind of thing.

406
00:19:14,463 --> 00:19:17,915
Yeah. Yeah, I'm gonna use that.

407
00:19:17,915 --> 00:19:19,296
So, <i>Platoon?</i>

408
00:19:19,296 --> 00:19:20,400
Anyway, yeah. So, uh...

409
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,644
Before the cast went
to the Philippines

410
00:19:22,644 --> 00:19:24,715
- to film the movie, right?
- Right.

411
00:19:24,715 --> 00:19:26,337
- Charlie Sheen.
- Yeah.

412
00:19:26,337 --> 00:19:27,580
- Willem Dafoe.
- Right.

413
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:29,237
And, uh, yeah,
a really young Johnny Depp.

414
00:19:29,237 --> 00:19:31,031
- Oh, yeah. Depp.
- Well...

415
00:19:31,031 --> 00:19:35,070
They all got to work with
a real-life drill sergeant...

416
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:37,348
- Right. Yeah.
- Right? For two or three weeks.

417
00:19:37,348 --> 00:19:40,109
And it really
helped them feel like

418
00:19:40,109 --> 00:19:41,904
what it feels like
to be in the jungle.

419
00:19:41,904 --> 00:19:43,596
- Right, right. Yeah.
- So it really, really helped

420
00:19:43,596 --> 00:19:45,011
with their performance
and everything.

421
00:19:45,011 --> 00:19:46,323
Yeah.

422
00:19:46,323 --> 00:19:48,221
Oh, so you want to do that
but with firefighting?

423
00:19:48,221 --> 00:19:50,258
- Yes, exactly. Exactly.
- Yeah.

424
00:19:50,258 --> 00:19:52,570
A weekend up in the mountains,
just the men.

425
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:54,572
You know, or we just could
do it at my place in Malibu.

426
00:19:54,572 --> 00:19:56,781
Uh, but yeah, anyway, you can be

427
00:19:56,781 --> 00:19:58,542
the, uh, drill sergeant
and I don't know, like,

428
00:19:58,542 --> 00:20:00,233
berate us
to your heart's content.

429
00:20:00,233 --> 00:20:01,234
Well, I love berating people.

430
00:20:03,719 --> 00:20:05,549
This is disgusting!

431
00:20:07,896 --> 00:20:09,346
I'll have a think on it.

432
00:20:09,346 --> 00:20:10,381
You take your time,
it's all right.

433
00:20:10,381 --> 00:20:11,693
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
you mull it over.

434
00:20:11,693 --> 00:20:14,247
- I'm gonna mull it. Okay.
- Yeah, yeah. Amazing.

435
00:20:14,247 --> 00:20:15,973
Oh, oh-oh.
Bobby, Bobby, Bobby.

436
00:20:15,973 --> 00:20:17,354
Yeah, yeah,
just one more idea, all right?

437
00:20:17,354 --> 00:20:20,115
I think that my character
should use a catch phrase.

438
00:20:20,115 --> 00:20:21,772
- All right?
So you can imagine...
- Yeah.

439
00:20:21,772 --> 00:20:23,049
All the bells are going off,

440
00:20:23,049 --> 00:20:24,602
we're running to our firetruck
and everything,

441
00:20:24,602 --> 00:20:27,260
and then I stand there
and I say something like,

442
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:30,125
"Let's saddle up, boys."

443
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:32,127
- Yeah.
- What'd you think?
Did you like it?

444
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:33,577
It's got a real Western flavor.

445
00:20:33,577 --> 00:20:35,820
Oh, my God, that is
exactly what I thought.

446
00:20:36,821 --> 00:20:37,960
I'm gonna try it.

447
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,272
All right, we're back in.

448
00:20:39,272 --> 00:20:41,136
Uh...

449
00:20:41,136 --> 00:20:42,482
<i>Bobby Nash.</i>

450
00:20:42,482 --> 00:20:44,415
He's the technical advisor
on your show.

451
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:46,141
I-I don't care
if you're rolling, okay?

452
00:20:46,141 --> 00:20:48,316
It's an emergency.
It's several emergencies.

453
00:20:48,316 --> 00:20:50,801
Okay, just pack the leg with
ice, it'll reduce the swelling.

454
00:20:50,801 --> 00:20:52,147
I need you to make sure

455
00:20:52,147 --> 00:20:54,805
that there's nothing
obstructing his airways.

456
00:20:54,805 --> 00:20:56,600
She hit the roof of the cabin?

457
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,601
<i>Is she talking?</i>

458
00:20:57,601 --> 00:20:59,292
Sort of.

459
00:20:59,292 --> 00:21:02,330
Breathe, Donna.
We're right here with you, hon.

460
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:04,021
Chimney,
I think her leg's broken.

461
00:21:04,021 --> 00:21:05,298
And why would you think that?

462
00:21:05,298 --> 00:21:07,956
Well, for one, it's crooked!

463
00:21:09,302 --> 00:21:12,581
Right. Okay. Did you come
with a carry-on today?

464
00:21:12,581 --> 00:21:14,307
No, I'm traveling light.

465
00:21:14,307 --> 00:21:15,446
<i>Then find one.</i>

466
00:21:15,446 --> 00:21:16,551
We're making a splint.

467
00:21:18,035 --> 00:21:19,450
Hey!

468
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:21,625
Does anyone have a carry-on?

469
00:21:21,625 --> 00:21:23,937
I need to make a splint.

470
00:21:23,937 --> 00:21:25,318
I have something.

471
00:21:25,318 --> 00:21:26,871
<i>How's his blood pressure?</i>

472
00:21:26,871 --> 00:21:28,425
BP's holding.

473
00:21:28,425 --> 00:21:29,943
But he's still unconscious.

474
00:21:29,943 --> 00:21:31,186
And I think I have

475
00:21:31,186 --> 00:21:32,670
some smelling salts.
<i>No!</i>

476
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:35,052
Absolutely not. He's stable,
just keep monitoring him.

477
00:21:35,052 --> 00:21:37,330
Tia, describe
his breathing to me.

478
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:39,850
It's like quick, short breaths.

479
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:42,197
He started flipping out
when the oxygen masks

480
00:21:42,197 --> 00:21:44,026
- came down.
<i>- Okay.</i>

481
00:21:44,026 --> 00:21:45,373
I think this may be
a panic attack.

482
00:21:45,373 --> 00:21:46,719
We're just,
we're gonna coach him

483
00:21:46,719 --> 00:21:48,514
through some breathing, okay?

484
00:21:48,514 --> 00:21:49,549
Hey.

485
00:21:49,549 --> 00:21:51,344
I got you.

486
00:21:51,344 --> 00:21:52,863
We're gonna do some
breathing together, okay?

487
00:21:52,863 --> 00:21:54,761
Yeah, okay.

488
00:21:56,694 --> 00:21:59,041
Here! Here! Here.

489
00:21:59,041 --> 00:22:01,320
Okay, I got a handle.

490
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,736
<i>Okay,
put the handle under her leg</i>

491
00:22:03,736 --> 00:22:05,013
<i>and find something
to support it.</i>

492
00:22:05,013 --> 00:22:06,428
Give me a magazine!

493
00:22:15,195 --> 00:22:17,370
<i>Sergeant Grant.</i>
- Yeah?

494
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:18,544
<i>The flight instructor's here.</i>

495
00:22:18,544 --> 00:22:19,752
Okay.
<i>Sergeant,</i>

496
00:22:19,752 --> 00:22:21,374
<i>my name is Jimmy Hadley,</i>

497
00:22:21,374 --> 00:22:22,755
<i>I'm your flight instructor.</i>

498
00:22:22,755 --> 00:22:24,377
I've graduated
hundreds of students

499
00:22:24,377 --> 00:22:27,553
from my flight school,
from pro athletes to grandmas.

500
00:22:27,553 --> 00:22:31,246
I am very familiar with
the aircraft that you are in.

501
00:22:31,246 --> 00:22:33,075
We are gonna do just fine.

502
00:22:33,075 --> 00:22:36,389
<i>- You all strapped in?</i>
- Yeah.

503
00:22:36,389 --> 00:22:38,426
<i>Okay, I'm gonna let you know
what we're gonna do here.</i>

504
00:22:38,426 --> 00:22:41,774
You have burned quite a bit
of fuel going over the ocean.

505
00:22:41,774 --> 00:22:44,708
- That's a problem.
<i>- No, actually, that's good.</i>

506
00:22:44,708 --> 00:22:47,055
The lighter you are, the easier
it's gonna be to land her.

507
00:22:47,055 --> 00:22:48,781
So, I'm gonna bring you
back here in a nice big arc

508
00:22:48,781 --> 00:22:50,576
and give you lots of time

509
00:22:50,576 --> 00:22:53,268
<i>to make it easier to handle her
on your run up to the airport.</i>

510
00:22:53,268 --> 00:22:55,270
But...

511
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:57,893
the first thing we got to do
is turn you around.

512
00:22:57,893 --> 00:23:00,102
How do we do that?

513
00:23:00,102 --> 00:23:01,449
We're going to change
your heading

514
00:23:01,449 --> 00:23:03,209
to left turn three-six-zero.

515
00:23:03,209 --> 00:23:05,142
<i>That doesn't tell me anything.</i>

516
00:23:05,142 --> 00:23:06,971
<i>I want you</i>

517
00:23:06,971 --> 00:23:09,457
<i>to look up at the top row
of your instrument panel,</i>

518
00:23:09,457 --> 00:23:11,320
<i>just below the windscreen.</i>

519
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:13,150
<i>- You see it?</i>
- Yeah, I do, I do.

520
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:15,911
<i>Okay, good.
You see the displays there?</i>

521
00:23:15,911 --> 00:23:17,326
<i>The ones with the
numbers in it?</i>

522
00:23:17,326 --> 00:23:19,605
You want the one
with the current heading.

523
00:23:19,605 --> 00:23:22,815
Which the hell one is that?

524
00:23:22,815 --> 00:23:24,333
This one.

525
00:23:25,473 --> 00:23:26,888
<i>It's the one that reads--</i>

526
00:23:26,888 --> 00:23:28,061
"Two-six-zero"?

527
00:23:28,061 --> 00:23:30,650
<i>Very good. Head of the class.</i>

528
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:32,445
<i>Now you see the dial
that's underneath it?</i>

529
00:23:32,445 --> 00:23:34,274
<i>I want you to turn it left</i>

530
00:23:34,274 --> 00:23:35,448
until it reads,

531
00:23:35,448 --> 00:23:37,657
<i>"three-six-zero."</i>

532
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:45,769
Okay. Got it. Now what?

533
00:23:46,839 --> 00:23:48,668
Now you relax.

534
00:23:48,668 --> 00:23:51,671
Congratulations, you just
turned a jetliner around.

535
00:23:51,671 --> 00:23:54,502
- That's it?
- For now.

536
00:23:56,158 --> 00:23:58,333
What do you mean? How long
does it take to shoot a scene?

537
00:23:58,333 --> 00:24:00,162
Okay, you guys are doing great.

538
00:24:00,162 --> 00:24:02,441
Did you find anything
to hold it together?

539
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:04,512
Yeah, we got some neckties!

540
00:24:04,512 --> 00:24:06,583
Okay, perfect. What I want
you to do is I want you

541
00:24:06,583 --> 00:24:07,963
to tie it around so it's secure,

542
00:24:07,963 --> 00:24:11,035
<i>but not too tight that
it restricts blood flow.</i>

543
00:24:12,485 --> 00:24:13,521
I'm sorry, Coach.

544
00:24:13,521 --> 00:24:16,178
Hey. We are going
to that tournament.

545
00:24:16,178 --> 00:24:18,457
And no matter what,
you are still

546
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:20,597
- team captain, okay?
- Uh-huh.

547
00:24:20,597 --> 00:24:22,875
Chimney!

548
00:24:22,875 --> 00:24:25,705
Her leg's swelling up
really bad!

549
00:24:25,705 --> 00:24:27,604
Uh, feel around her ankle.

550
00:24:27,604 --> 00:24:29,502
<i>Can you find her pulse?</i>

551
00:24:32,436 --> 00:24:34,473
- I got one!
<i>- Okay, good.</i>

552
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:35,888
I need you to keep
checking for it.

553
00:24:35,888 --> 00:24:38,477
What happens if I can't feel it?

554
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:39,788
Then we worry.

555
00:24:39,788 --> 00:24:42,204
Exhale.

556
00:24:42,204 --> 00:24:45,725
Two, three, four.

557
00:24:45,725 --> 00:24:48,556
Hold...

558
00:24:48,556 --> 00:24:50,350
Hen, I don't think
this is helping.

559
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:52,870
<i>He's still having
trouble breathing?</i>

560
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:55,873
Yeah. And his lips,
they're turning blue.

561
00:24:55,873 --> 00:24:58,082
All right, Tia, I don't think
this is a panic attack.

562
00:25:00,222 --> 00:25:04,917
Yeah, me, neither.

563
00:25:09,059 --> 00:25:10,923
He's coughing pink goo.

564
00:25:10,923 --> 00:25:12,580
<i>That would be bloody sputum.</i>

565
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:15,583
Okay, when the plane climbed,
you said he was on oxygen?

566
00:25:15,583 --> 00:25:17,067
No, he broke his mask.

567
00:25:17,067 --> 00:25:19,414
Okay, I think he has

568
00:25:19,414 --> 00:25:21,105
high-altitude pulmonary edema.

569
00:25:21,105 --> 00:25:22,935
<i>Mountain climbers get it,
it's fluid in the lungs,</i>

570
00:25:22,935 --> 00:25:25,662
<i>- drowning him
from the inside out.</i>
- What do we do?

571
00:25:25,662 --> 00:25:27,387
<i>Normal treatment
would be to get him</i>

572
00:25:27,387 --> 00:25:29,424
to the ground, but since that's
not happening anytime soon,

573
00:25:29,424 --> 00:25:33,117
can you, can you reach
one of those O2 masks?

574
00:25:46,579 --> 00:25:48,788
Hen, the oxygen's not working.

575
00:25:48,788 --> 00:25:50,894
Okay, then we need
something stronger.

576
00:25:50,894 --> 00:25:52,792
Something that will keep
his blood vessels dilated,

577
00:25:52,792 --> 00:25:55,588
carrying the fluid
out of his lungs.

578
00:25:55,588 --> 00:25:56,796
I have an idea.

579
00:25:56,796 --> 00:25:58,280
Attention!

580
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:01,594
Does anybody here
have erectile dysfunction?

581
00:26:01,594 --> 00:26:04,424
Is anybody carrying sildenafil?

582
00:26:04,424 --> 00:26:05,909
E.D. meds.

583
00:26:05,909 --> 00:26:08,083
A man's life depends on it.

584
00:26:08,083 --> 00:26:09,360
Me.

585
00:26:10,948 --> 00:26:12,432
<i>Okay, how swollen is it now?</i>

586
00:26:13,433 --> 00:26:15,470
Everything under her knee,

587
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:17,299
it's all gone pale.

588
00:26:17,299 --> 00:26:18,922
All right,
I need you to carefully

589
00:26:18,922 --> 00:26:21,338
<i>remove the splint and feel</i>

590
00:26:21,338 --> 00:26:22,511
for her pulse.

591
00:26:25,825 --> 00:26:27,309
Ow!

592
00:26:31,175 --> 00:26:33,971
Nothing. I can't feel it.

593
00:26:33,971 --> 00:26:35,628
<i>So, what does that mean?</i>

594
00:26:35,628 --> 00:26:37,768
<i>It's called
compartment syndrome.</i>

595
00:26:37,768 --> 00:26:39,770
Pressure's building up,
stopping blood flow.

596
00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:42,014
If we don't relieve it soon,
she could lose her leg

597
00:26:42,014 --> 00:26:44,016
<i>- or even worse.</i>
- Well, how do we do that?

598
00:26:44,016 --> 00:26:45,638
- How do we relieve it?
<i>- We're gonna do</i>

599
00:26:45,638 --> 00:26:47,088
<i>what's called a fasciotomy.</i>

600
00:26:47,088 --> 00:26:48,503
A what?

601
00:26:48,503 --> 00:26:50,022
You're gonna cut it open.

602
00:26:50,022 --> 00:26:52,369
<i>We need something razor-sharp.</i>

603
00:26:52,369 --> 00:26:54,095
Airplane cutlery will not work.

604
00:26:54,095 --> 00:26:55,993
<i>Has to be razor-sharp.</i>

605
00:26:55,993 --> 00:26:57,546
We all went through security.

606
00:26:57,546 --> 00:26:59,997
There is nothing razor-sharp.

607
00:26:59,997 --> 00:27:01,136
I can make a blade.

608
00:27:01,136 --> 00:27:03,449
Get me a toothbrush

609
00:27:03,449 --> 00:27:04,899
and a cigarette lighter.

610
00:27:06,797 --> 00:27:08,627
Can you take my dog?
Yeah, yeah.

611
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:10,145
Thank you.

612
00:27:11,699 --> 00:27:14,046
Okay. Open wide.

613
00:27:18,395 --> 00:27:21,398
How is he supposed to swallow
them when he's out cold?

614
00:27:21,398 --> 00:27:24,297
Rub his throat,
like with my dog?
<i>Do not.</i>

615
00:27:24,297 --> 00:27:25,851
Do not. He-he could choke.

616
00:27:25,851 --> 00:27:29,026
We have to find some other way
to give him this medication.

617
00:27:29,026 --> 00:27:31,373
Hi. Me again.

618
00:27:31,373 --> 00:27:33,513
Now we're looking
for a nebulizer.

619
00:27:33,513 --> 00:27:37,241
So, if anybody has asthma or--

620
00:27:37,241 --> 00:27:38,864
I packed one.

621
00:27:38,864 --> 00:27:40,659
For my COPD.

622
00:27:42,902 --> 00:27:43,972
You two.

623
00:27:43,972 --> 00:27:45,249
Really coming through.

624
00:27:45,249 --> 00:27:47,389
Perks of being geriatric, dear.

625
00:27:53,602 --> 00:27:55,397
You're making a prison shiv.

626
00:27:55,397 --> 00:27:57,158
Where did you learn
how to do that?

627
00:27:57,158 --> 00:27:59,263
Where do you think?

628
00:28:03,647 --> 00:28:05,269
All right, now,
when you have the powder,

629
00:28:05,269 --> 00:28:07,513
<i>mix it with water
in the reservoir.</i>

630
00:28:07,513 --> 00:28:09,239
Okay, doing it.

631
00:28:19,318 --> 00:28:21,285
Okay.

632
00:28:21,285 --> 00:28:22,735
Now what?

633
00:28:22,735 --> 00:28:25,600
Turn it on and pray I'm right.

634
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,706
Okay. Come on.

635
00:28:29,155 --> 00:28:30,467
Come on.

636
00:28:40,442 --> 00:28:43,135
He's waking up.

637
00:28:50,763 --> 00:28:52,627
Did you just save me?

638
00:28:53,662 --> 00:28:56,148
I... I guess I did.

639
00:28:57,597 --> 00:28:59,461
<i>All right, keep him on the neb.</i>

640
00:28:59,461 --> 00:29:00,946
<i>Let the pills do their job.</i>

641
00:29:00,946 --> 00:29:03,051
And find a blanket
and put it over his legs.

642
00:29:03,051 --> 00:29:04,915
What's the blanket for?

643
00:29:04,915 --> 00:29:06,606
Modesty.

644
00:29:08,954 --> 00:29:10,990
Right.

645
00:29:17,445 --> 00:29:19,343
Okay, that's sharp.

646
00:29:23,485 --> 00:29:25,177
And sterilized.

647
00:29:25,177 --> 00:29:26,419
Here.

648
00:29:26,419 --> 00:29:27,800
Me?
- Yeah.

649
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,077
I've never shivved anyone.

650
00:29:29,077 --> 00:29:30,285
Well, neither have I.

651
00:29:30,285 --> 00:29:31,493
Somebody!

652
00:29:31,493 --> 00:29:33,910
- Somebody!
- Okay.

653
00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:36,429
All right. What do I do?

654
00:29:36,429 --> 00:29:38,259
<i>Okay, I need you to cut</i>

655
00:29:38,259 --> 00:29:40,675
through to the muscle,
half inch deep.

656
00:29:40,675 --> 00:29:43,022
<i>Start below the knee,
on the inside of her leg.</i>

657
00:29:46,336 --> 00:29:48,338
Okay, okay, okay.

658
00:29:48,338 --> 00:29:49,442
Oh, God!

659
00:29:49,442 --> 00:29:51,272
Is it supposed to make a pop?

660
00:29:51,272 --> 00:29:53,619
Yes, now cut down to her ankle.

661
00:29:53,619 --> 00:29:55,345
<i>It's just like
slicing a sausage.</i>

662
00:29:57,174 --> 00:29:59,176
Hang in there, Donna!

663
00:30:09,877 --> 00:30:12,155
It-it feels better.

664
00:30:13,742 --> 00:30:16,400
You cut my leg open
and it feels better.

665
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,850
<i>How's the color?</i>

666
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:19,507
It's coming back!

667
00:30:19,507 --> 00:30:20,542
It's pink.

668
00:30:20,542 --> 00:30:22,544
And I can feel a pulse.

669
00:30:22,544 --> 00:30:24,581
There we go. Good job, team.

670
00:30:24,581 --> 00:30:26,583
<i>Good job, guys.</i>

671
00:30:34,039 --> 00:30:35,730
Who are you here with?

672
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:37,421
My dad.

673
00:30:38,422 --> 00:30:39,838
Does he know you're up here?

674
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:41,909
He's helping a lady.

675
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:46,396
You two going
to Hawaii on vacation?

676
00:30:46,396 --> 00:30:48,294
It's my mom's birthday.

677
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:51,297
She live out there?

678
00:30:53,265 --> 00:30:56,406
We lost Jem's mom
a couple years ago,

679
00:30:56,406 --> 00:30:57,890
so we like to do things
she liked to do.

680
00:30:57,890 --> 00:30:59,305
You know, to celebrate.

681
00:31:00,410 --> 00:31:01,721
Come on, Jem.

682
00:31:01,721 --> 00:31:03,862
We need to get back
to our seats.

683
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:07,003
Hey, thanks for the assist.

684
00:31:07,003 --> 00:31:08,590
No problem.

685
00:31:13,216 --> 00:31:16,253
Now that's just terrifying.

686
00:31:17,945 --> 00:31:20,430
How's everybody doing
back there?

687
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:21,638
They're all alive.

688
00:31:21,638 --> 00:31:25,021
Your friends
on the ground saw to it.

689
00:31:25,021 --> 00:31:26,885
Hey, speaking of ground,

690
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:30,923
the powers that be know how
they're gonna get us there yet?

691
00:31:30,923 --> 00:31:32,373
Yeah, they got a plan.

692
00:31:32,373 --> 00:31:34,444
They want me to land the plane.

693
00:31:34,444 --> 00:31:36,204
Uh-huh.

694
00:31:36,204 --> 00:31:39,207
I appreciate
the vote of confidence.

695
00:31:39,207 --> 00:31:40,277
Hey!

696
00:31:41,485 --> 00:31:42,831
Listen.

697
00:31:43,971 --> 00:31:47,560
If anybody
on this thing can do it,

698
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:49,528
I'd put my money on you.

699
00:31:50,529 --> 00:31:54,153
But in the event things
don't go like we'd like it,

700
00:31:54,153 --> 00:31:57,294
maybe we should call down there
and let someone else know

701
00:31:57,294 --> 00:31:59,607
where Fulton's black book is.

702
00:31:59,607 --> 00:32:02,334
Just in case we don't make it.

703
00:32:04,370 --> 00:32:06,545
You got somebody you trust?

704
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:10,273
Yeah, I do.

705
00:32:12,171 --> 00:32:14,691
I just haven't been able
to get ahold of him.

706
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:24,321
You know,

707
00:32:24,321 --> 00:32:27,117
I always thought
the support dog thing was BS,

708
00:32:27,117 --> 00:32:29,844
but there's something to it.

709
00:32:29,844 --> 00:32:31,156
Where's the steward?

710
00:32:31,156 --> 00:32:33,158
I'd like a ginger ale.

711
00:32:33,158 --> 00:32:35,643
I think they've suspended
cabin service, dear.

712
00:32:36,644 --> 00:32:39,681
Guys, I know it's scary,

713
00:32:39,681 --> 00:32:43,547
and... I know my leg
is really gross.

714
00:32:44,583 --> 00:32:46,965
But we adapt, right?

715
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:48,725
We got this.

716
00:32:48,725 --> 00:32:50,899
We're gonna be okay.

717
00:33:07,019 --> 00:33:09,021
Janowitz, I want that report
on my desk in the morning.

718
00:33:09,021 --> 00:33:10,540
And spell-checked this time.

719
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:12,542
Captain Maynard, a word.

720
00:33:12,542 --> 00:33:14,544
I thought you two were at LAX,
picking up your prisoner.

721
00:33:14,544 --> 00:33:15,717
We were.

722
00:33:15,717 --> 00:33:17,823
One tiny little problem.

723
00:33:17,823 --> 00:33:19,376
Our prisoner
wasn't on his flight.

724
00:33:19,376 --> 00:33:21,068
Nor was your Sergeant Grant.

725
00:33:21,068 --> 00:33:23,553
So, we'd really appreciate it
if we could have a moment.

726
00:33:23,553 --> 00:33:25,555
Any information
you might have on...

727
00:33:25,555 --> 00:33:27,936
Where the hell
they both might be right now.

728
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:30,767
You sure you went
to the right gate?

729
00:33:30,767 --> 00:33:33,597
Yes, we went to the right gate
and to the right airport.

730
00:33:33,597 --> 00:33:35,220
But maybe we didn't pick
the right cop for the job.

731
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:36,704
You didn't pick her, remember?

732
00:33:36,704 --> 00:33:38,326
Dennis Jenkins did.

733
00:33:38,326 --> 00:33:39,914
Let me try her cell.

734
00:33:39,914 --> 00:33:41,950
We did that already,
numerous times.

735
00:33:43,055 --> 00:33:45,057
- It always goes straight to--
- Voicemail.

736
00:33:45,057 --> 00:33:46,783
Captain Maynard?

737
00:33:46,783 --> 00:33:49,268
Do we have to emphasize to you
just how serious

738
00:33:49,268 --> 00:33:50,580
this matter is?

739
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:52,513
Oh, I'm perfectly aware
of what's at stake.

740
00:33:52,513 --> 00:33:53,686
Maybe you aren't,

741
00:33:53,686 --> 00:33:55,412
because if Dennis Jenkins
isn't delivered to us

742
00:33:55,412 --> 00:33:56,689
cuffed and in one piece

743
00:33:56,689 --> 00:33:57,759
- within the hour--
- What?

744
00:33:57,759 --> 00:33:59,761
You'll take
Sergeant Grant's badge?

745
00:33:59,761 --> 00:34:01,384
Not just hers.

746
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:04,249
Gentlemen,

747
00:34:04,249 --> 00:34:06,768
I am certain there is
a perfectly simple

748
00:34:06,768 --> 00:34:08,598
explanation for what's happened.

749
00:34:08,598 --> 00:34:11,428
And whatever situation
Athena finds herself in

750
00:34:11,428 --> 00:34:12,636
with Dennis Jenkins,

751
00:34:12,636 --> 00:34:17,124
I am 100% positive
she has it under control.

752
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:23,785
<i>Sergeant Grant,
what's happening up there?</i>

753
00:34:23,785 --> 00:34:26,478
That hole in
the back of the plane,

754
00:34:26,478 --> 00:34:27,789
<i>it just got bigger.</i>

755
00:34:27,789 --> 00:34:29,619
Airspeed dropping to 220 knots.

756
00:34:32,139 --> 00:34:34,279
It's 210 now.

757
00:34:35,832 --> 00:34:37,834
Descending to 9,000 feet.

758
00:34:45,669 --> 00:34:48,155
No, no, Jem, no. Don't.

759
00:34:48,155 --> 00:34:49,777
I can help.

760
00:34:51,158 --> 00:34:52,987
Okay, okay. Go.

761
00:34:53,953 --> 00:34:55,334
Descending to 8,200 feet.

762
00:34:55,334 --> 00:34:56,646
They're falling out of the sky.

763
00:34:56,646 --> 00:34:57,854
<i>Talk to me, people.</i>

764
00:34:57,854 --> 00:34:58,993
<i>What the hell is happening?</i>

765
00:34:58,993 --> 00:35:00,132
It's the breach in the fuselage.

766
00:35:00,132 --> 00:35:02,134
All the wind
in the cabin is creating drag.

767
00:35:02,134 --> 00:35:04,688
It's slowing you down
and it's pulling you down.

768
00:35:04,688 --> 00:35:06,138
Tell me how to stop it.

769
00:35:06,138 --> 00:35:08,175
You have to speed up.

770
00:35:09,383 --> 00:35:11,143
Sorry, he insisted.

771
00:35:11,143 --> 00:35:13,145
Sir, return
to your seat, please.

772
00:35:13,145 --> 00:35:15,354
And you, buckle up.

773
00:35:16,459 --> 00:35:18,357
We're all safer with him here.

774
00:35:18,357 --> 00:35:20,911
I can do this, Dad.

775
00:35:25,053 --> 00:35:26,883
I love you.

776
00:35:26,883 --> 00:35:28,229
Okay?

777
00:35:30,473 --> 00:35:31,681
I love you.

778
00:35:36,479 --> 00:35:38,722
Getting bumpy, ATC.

779
00:35:38,722 --> 00:35:41,484
Okay, we need to add
30% more thrust to compensate.

780
00:35:41,484 --> 00:35:43,417
<i>Find the lever, push
it forward</i>

781
00:35:47,421 --> 00:35:49,181
How far?

782
00:35:49,181 --> 00:35:50,941
<i>All the way.</i>

783
00:35:56,015 --> 00:35:59,329
<i>Keep going until
the indicator shows 250.</i>

784
00:36:00,606 --> 00:36:02,677
<i>Now, the nose is gonna
want to pitch up,</i>

785
00:36:02,677 --> 00:36:05,715
<i>but the autopilot
is going to compensate.</i>

786
00:36:13,861 --> 00:36:16,070
<i>Autopilot disconnected.</i>

787
00:36:16,070 --> 00:36:17,589
<i>Autopilot disconnected.</i>

788
00:36:17,589 --> 00:36:20,074
The autopilot just checked out.

789
00:36:20,074 --> 00:36:21,248
It's the drag.

790
00:36:21,248 --> 00:36:23,042
You need to nose down manually,

791
00:36:23,042 --> 00:36:24,734
<i>but just five degrees.</i>

792
00:36:24,734 --> 00:36:26,218
How do I do that?

793
00:36:26,218 --> 00:36:28,841
Okay, you see that thing
that looks like a joystick?

794
00:36:28,841 --> 00:36:30,567
<i>Well, it works like one, too.</i>

795
00:36:30,567 --> 00:36:33,743
<i>But you have to be very gentle.</i>

796
00:36:33,743 --> 00:36:35,262
I've got it.

797
00:36:49,068 --> 00:36:51,485
ATC, we're level
with the horizon.

798
00:37:05,153 --> 00:37:07,466
250 knots.
You can put that back now.

799
00:37:14,301 --> 00:37:15,750
<i>Good job.</i>

800
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:18,512
Uh, Sergeant Grant, is there
someone in the cockpit with you?

801
00:37:19,961 --> 00:37:22,274
I just picked up a copilot.

802
00:37:22,274 --> 00:37:23,758
Say hello, Jem.

803
00:37:23,758 --> 00:37:25,139
Hello.

804
00:37:27,037 --> 00:37:28,246
Is that a kid?

805
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:29,592
Whoever it is,

806
00:37:29,592 --> 00:37:31,801
she's very lucky to have him.
That was very close.

807
00:37:31,801 --> 00:37:34,079
- At least it's still in the sky.
- Barely.

808
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:36,978
With this continued drag
on that compromised fuselage,

809
00:37:36,978 --> 00:37:39,429
the whole thing could
fall apart at any moment.

810
00:37:39,429 --> 00:37:41,776
We need to get them
on the ground immediately.

811
00:37:41,776 --> 00:37:43,399
All outbound flights
have been grounded.

812
00:37:43,399 --> 00:37:45,435
Everything incoming
has been diverted.

813
00:37:45,435 --> 00:37:47,265
Then there's only one thing
left to do.

814
00:37:48,611 --> 00:37:50,268
<i>All companies
in LAX Battalion 4</i>

815
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:52,994
<i>respond to runway south.
Full aircraft assignment.</i>

816
00:37:52,994 --> 00:37:54,858
<i>Task Force 118, Rescue 118,</i>

817
00:37:54,858 --> 00:37:57,827
<i>Stations 119, 133,</i>

818
00:37:57,827 --> 00:37:59,311
<i>prepare for
emergency touchdown</i>

819
00:37:59,311 --> 00:38:01,140
That's like half the department.

820
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:02,763
Buck!

821
00:38:02,763 --> 00:38:03,833
We have a call.

822
00:38:03,833 --> 00:38:05,662
I'll meet you guys at LAX.

823
00:38:05,662 --> 00:38:06,870
Where are you going?

824
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:08,147
To find Bobby.

825
00:38:28,651 --> 00:38:30,963
Keystar 63, you are now entering
the approach environment

826
00:38:30,963 --> 00:38:32,793
<i>- for SoCal radar control.</i>
- What does that mean?

827
00:38:32,793 --> 00:38:34,829
<i>Means it's time to discuss</i>

828
00:38:34,829 --> 00:38:37,315
initial descent procedures.
Are you ready?

829
00:38:38,281 --> 00:38:39,731
Do I have a choice?

830
00:38:39,731 --> 00:38:41,249
<i>Sergeant Grant, we've cleared</i>

831
00:38:41,249 --> 00:38:43,631
<i>the entire LAX airspace
and runways.</i>

832
00:38:43,631 --> 00:38:45,253
<i>You'll have it all to yourself.</i>

833
00:38:45,253 --> 00:38:47,394
We'll be in your ear
every step of the way.

834
00:38:49,948 --> 00:38:53,227
Okay. Okay, ATC, let's do this.

835
00:38:53,227 --> 00:38:55,712
While we still have
a plane to land.

836
00:38:56,886 --> 00:38:58,370
Sergeant!

837
00:38:58,370 --> 00:39:00,407
You're gonna want to see this.

838
00:39:01,304 --> 00:39:02,788
God, what now?

839
00:39:04,411 --> 00:39:06,516
Hold on, sir.

840
00:39:06,516 --> 00:39:08,725
We're gonna get you
out of that toilet.

841
00:39:11,763 --> 00:39:13,351
Cap, I see him.

842
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:16,250
All right.

843
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:18,563
That's lunch!

844
00:39:20,875 --> 00:39:22,567
Hey. Hey, Bobby. Bobby...

845
00:39:22,567 --> 00:39:24,120
- Hey. Hey, Brad.
- Do you have a second?

846
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,397
Oh, you were great
in that last scene, yeah.

847
00:39:25,397 --> 00:39:26,502
Oh, really?
Did you think so, really?

848
00:39:26,502 --> 00:39:28,227
- Yeah, compelling stuff.
- Hey, I was wondering,

849
00:39:28,227 --> 00:39:29,953
did you have a chance to think
about what we talked about?

850
00:39:29,953 --> 00:39:32,197
I did, but I want
to think about it some more.

851
00:39:32,197 --> 00:39:33,854
Right now, I got to
check in with my wife.

852
00:39:33,854 --> 00:39:35,925
- Well, happy wife, happy life.
- You said it.

853
00:39:35,925 --> 00:39:38,410
And in my case, wives. Five.

854
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:40,308
- You must be a happy guy.
- Yeah.

855
00:39:40,308 --> 00:39:42,103
<i>What we know so far is this:</i>

856
00:39:42,103 --> 00:39:44,312
<i>the airliner collided with
a smaller aircraft</i>

857
00:39:44,312 --> 00:39:48,040
<i>on its descent into L.A.,
and was badly damaged.</i>

858
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:49,456
<i>Bobby...</i>

859
00:39:51,147 --> 00:39:52,424
<i>I love you, baby.</i>

860
00:39:52,424 --> 00:39:53,977
<i>The latest breaking news</i>

861
00:39:53,977 --> 00:39:56,117
<i>on the ongoing crisis
in the sky.</i>

862
00:39:56,117 --> 00:39:58,534
<i>No word yet on what became
of that other aircraft,</i>

863
00:39:58,534 --> 00:40:00,743
<i>but the wide-body, reportedly,</i>

864
00:40:00,743 --> 00:40:02,952
<i>is being piloted now
by a passenger.</i>

865
00:40:04,125 --> 00:40:06,576
Did they say where
that flight took off from?

866
00:40:06,576 --> 00:40:08,060
Bobby!

867
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:09,441
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

868
00:40:09,441 --> 00:40:11,270
Bobby! Bobby!

869
00:40:11,270 --> 00:40:13,307
Athena's on that flight,
isn't she?

870
00:40:13,307 --> 00:40:14,412
- She's flying it.
- Of course she is.

871
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:15,723
What else would she be doing?

872
00:40:15,723 --> 00:40:17,622
Central dispatched, like,
every company in the city

873
00:40:17,622 --> 00:40:19,347
to LAX for an emergency landing.

874
00:40:19,347 --> 00:40:21,280
- All right, where's your car?
- It's this way.

875
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:23,144
Streets were jammed.
Took me forever to get here.

876
00:40:23,144 --> 00:40:24,318
All right, we're taking that.

877
00:40:24,318 --> 00:40:25,975
Seriously?

878
00:40:25,975 --> 00:40:27,839
Yeah, seriously.
Get in, let's go.

879
00:40:33,189 --> 00:40:34,949
All right, boys.

880
00:40:34,949 --> 00:40:36,330
Let's saddle up.

881
00:40:36,330 --> 00:40:37,814
Brad...

882
00:40:38,850 --> 00:40:39,954
Whatever.

883
00:40:42,509 --> 00:40:45,684
He started mumbling,
and then he sat up.

884
00:40:45,684 --> 00:40:47,790
How you feeling?

885
00:40:48,791 --> 00:40:51,345
Kind of bloated, actually.

886
00:40:51,345 --> 00:40:52,691
My leg hurts.

887
00:40:52,691 --> 00:40:54,969
I'm just glad you're alive.

888
00:40:54,969 --> 00:40:57,800
And more than a little glad
that you're awake.

889
00:40:59,836 --> 00:41:01,148
Captain Dominguez?

890
00:41:04,254 --> 00:41:06,947
- Any other casualties?
- No.

891
00:41:06,947 --> 00:41:09,950
Some injuries,
but we just kept her in the air

892
00:41:09,950 --> 00:41:11,227
just waiting for you.

893
00:41:11,227 --> 00:41:13,712
Does anyone know where we are?

894
00:41:13,712 --> 00:41:17,371
Yeah, we just crossed into
SoCal radar control.

895
00:41:17,371 --> 00:41:19,787
Who turned the plane around?

896
00:41:19,787 --> 00:41:22,203
- I did.
- You a pilot?

897
00:41:22,203 --> 00:41:24,205
LAPD field sergeant.

898
00:41:24,205 --> 00:41:26,242
Wow, but I should
probably take over.

899
00:41:26,242 --> 00:41:27,899
Yeah, I think
we'd all prefer that, yeah.

900
00:41:27,899 --> 00:41:31,385
ATC, you getting all of this?

901
00:41:31,385 --> 00:41:33,214
<i>Copy that.</i>

902
00:41:33,214 --> 00:41:35,216
We've got a licensed pilot
on board.

903
00:41:35,216 --> 00:41:38,012
A conscious one, that is.

904
00:41:38,012 --> 00:41:41,050
You made it back to
the party just in time.

905
00:41:41,050 --> 00:41:42,534
<i>Sergeant, I can't</i>

906
00:41:42,534 --> 00:41:45,537
tell you what a relief that is
for us here on the ground.

907
00:41:45,537 --> 00:41:48,333
And us in the sky, too.

908
00:41:48,333 --> 00:41:49,645
All right. Okay, help me up.

909
00:41:53,925 --> 00:41:55,236
Wait. Wait.

910
00:41:55,236 --> 00:41:57,238
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

911
00:41:57,238 --> 00:41:59,068
Yeah. Just let...

912
00:41:59,068 --> 00:42:00,069
let me get my--

913
00:42:00,069 --> 00:42:01,242
What's happening?

914
00:42:01,242 --> 00:42:02,968
Get him on the floor!

915
00:42:05,108 --> 00:42:07,594
I think he's having
a heart attack.

916
00:42:08,629 --> 00:42:09,768
No pulse!

917
00:42:09,768 --> 00:42:12,253
Starting compressions!

918
00:42:14,048 --> 00:42:17,535
Come on! Come on!
