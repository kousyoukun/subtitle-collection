1
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:18,456
Okay, 118, I want ladders up, ventilation,

2
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,610
inch-and-three-quarter
hose line. Let's go!

3
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:24,796
Hoses out! Let's get that water flowing!

4
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:26,006
Ladders. Come on, let's go, let's go!

5
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:27,666
Let's do it!

6
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:29,466
My god! No!

7
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:31,966
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Sir! Sir!
- My god!

8
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:33,596
My wife and my son, are they okay?

9
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:34,597
- How old is your son?
- He's 11 months old.

10
00:00:34,621 --> 00:00:37,056
There's a nursery on the
second floor on the right.

11
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,647
Okay, we will get them
out of there. Officer.

12
00:00:38,671 --> 00:00:39,686
Come here, sir.

13
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:41,186
Kinard, han, Wilson, double time!

14
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:42,147
We got people inside!

15
00:00:42,171 --> 00:00:43,460
On it!

16
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:45,960
Let's go! Let's go!

17
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:49,260
Lafd! Can anyone hear me?

18
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,656
Upstairs! Let's go!

19
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,010
We can't wait for that hose line!

20
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:56,560
Ma'am?

21
00:00:57,850 --> 00:00:59,366
Ma'am.

22
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:01,916
Hen, chim, get up here right now.

23
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:03,206
Ma'am, can you hear me?

24
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:04,746
Micah.

25
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:05,996
Micah? Where's Micah?

26
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:07,666
- The nursery.
- The nursery, okay.

27
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:09,966
Let's get her up and
let's get her out. Let's go.

28
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:11,636
- Where's that hose line?
- -It's on its way, cap.

29
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:13,926
We can't wait! Let's go, Tommy!

30
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:15,120
Cap, wait!

31
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:07,476
And this is north remembrance hall.

32
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,066
In addition to our
outdoor interment spaces,

33
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:12,646
we also have four mausoleum halls,

34
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:14,696
as well as three indoor columbaria.

35
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,326
We have several vaults available

36
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:19,036
in east hall, if you prefer,

37
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:21,576
but I've always liked the morning light

38
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,416
in here. The halls are
all climate controlled

39
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,797
and open to visitors
8:00 A.M. to 6:00 P.M.,

40
00:02:26,821 --> 00:02:29,166
362 days a year.

41
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,836
- Mom?
- We offer a floral placement service.

42
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:33,586
Some families choose to
have their flowers placed

43
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:35,966
on birthdays or holidays,
others on a more frequent basis.

44
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:37,807
The families don't come themselves?

45
00:02:37,831 --> 00:02:40,556
Some do, but life has a way of filling

46
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:42,340
all the nooks and
crannies of our calendars.

47
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:45,936
I just... Don't think it's right.

48
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:49,356
I don't think my husband
would want to be inside.

49
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:51,316
Appreciate your time, Mr. Powell,

50
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:53,907
but I think we need
to find someplace else.

51
00:02:53,931 --> 00:02:56,776
Mom, it's been almost two weeks.

52
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,776
At some point, we're gonna
have to have a funeral.

53
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,826
Yeah, tell that to the federal,
state and local authorities.

54
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:03,496
They still haven't released his body.

55
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:06,440
But they will eventually,
and we have to be ready.

56
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,546
And we will be.

57
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:18,780
We just need... To find the right place.

58
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:22,960
Maybe this is them, now.

59
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:28,420
Hello?

60
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:31,686
Um, I'm sorry.

61
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:34,840
I'm going to need you to
explain that to me again.

62
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,946
No.

63
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:39,890
I did not authorize that.

64
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,286
Did the kids leave already?

65
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:50,270
They got a lift to school with the Martins.

66
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:56,700
I... Wanted to make you breakfast.

67
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:02,386
I mean, thank you.

68
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:04,472
It's your first day back at work.

69
00:04:04,496 --> 00:04:07,136
A week earlier than your
doctor recommended.

70
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,306
It'll be light duty.

71
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:12,856
Don't worry, I'm not
looking to pop any stitches.

72
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:13,777
I can't believe they're asking you back

73
00:04:13,801 --> 00:04:16,606
before Bobby's even... in the ground?

74
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:17,720
It just

75
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:23,866
- seems wrong.
- Everything about this is wrong.

76
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:27,156
So, take the extra five days.

77
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,890
The boys are all coming back today, too.

78
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,296
I have to be there.

79
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,780
Okay.

80
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:40,676
Hey, hey, guys?

81
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,296
Buck?

82
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,556
Hey.

83
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:45,466
Is-is chimney ready?

84
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:47,426
He said we would drive
in together this morning.

85
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:48,886
First day back.

86
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:50,686
No, he's not here.

87
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:52,726
- He's not?
- He left before I woke up,

88
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,396
and when I texted him,

89
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:55,856
he said there was something
that he had to do before work.

90
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,170
Wait, he didn't tell you?

91
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:02,816
No. I-I... Feel like
he's not been telling me

92
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,366
a lot of things lately.

93
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:06,156
I think he might be avoiding me.

94
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,496
Yeah, he's been avoiding everyone.

95
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,076
Did he tell you that he's started running,

96
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,206
like, as a hobby?

97
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:13,036
Really?

98
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,666
I thought he hated running.

99
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:17,586
Well, now it's like his
favorite thing to do.

100
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:19,336
He said that it helps clear his mind.

101
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,360
I think it helps him
avoid talking to anyone.

102
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:26,216
He's talking to the
counselors, though, right?

103
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,766
He's been doing his sessions.

104
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:30,056
I don't know that he's
actually been talking to them.

105
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,420
What about you?

106
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:36,316
Yeah, well, I've done a
lot of therapy at this point.

107
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:37,840
Pretty good at it.

108
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:43,560
Okay...

109
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:46,946
What's this for?

110
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:49,616
Because I love you,

111
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,576
and given recent events,
I feel like that's something

112
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,076
that I should start saying more.

113
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,576
Yeah.

114
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,310
I love you, too.

115
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:08,556
Did you do this?

116
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:11,306
- I got a call from downtown.
- Athena

117
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:14,686
apparently, one of
captain Nash's firefighters

118
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:16,226
has been burning up the lines,

119
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,226
complaining about why it's taken so long

120
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:20,816
to release his remains. Was it you?

121
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:27,236
Yeah, but, I mean... it was
not your place to interfere.

122
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:29,286
I was just trying to help.
I didn't think it was right

123
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:30,866
they were making you
wait so long to Bury him.

124
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:33,746
Right, because until he's in the ground,

125
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:35,416
nobody gets to move on.

126
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,126
They have to live yet another day

127
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:39,876
thinking about Bobby and how he died.

128
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,796
Athena, no one's ever

129
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:44,256
gonna forget about what cap
did that day, least of all me.

130
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,030
Athena...

131
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:49,886
Well, congratulations, it worked.

132
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,660
Funeral's next Tuesday.

133
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:01,476
- Sorry.
- You're fine.

134
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,186
I might've come in the wrong
door. Is there a right door?

135
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:05,106
Depends. Who are you looking for?

136
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:06,526
Captain Bobby Nash.

137
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:09,776
Why are you looking for captain Nash?

138
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,160
I was hoping he could help
me keep my sister out of prison.

139
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:16,496
There you go.

140
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,800
- Enjoy. -Thank you.
- Thank you.

141
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,206
I'm sorry about your husband.

142
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:22,506
I hadn't heard the news, otherwise

143
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:24,296
I wouldn't have shown up like that.

144
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,610
You said your sister was in jail.

145
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,216
Why was she arrested?

146
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,386
Stalking, breaking and
entering, attempted kidnapping.

147
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:35,636
Who was her intended victim?

148
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:36,766
Her dead son.

149
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:39,436
Who she has become convinced

150
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:41,277
is not dead, but living in Santa clarita.

151
00:07:41,301 --> 00:07:45,566
My nephew Micah died
eight years ago in a house fire.

152
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:48,276
Leah was there when the fire broke out.

153
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,526
She couldn't get to him,

154
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:52,236
and by the time the firefighters got there,

155
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:54,496
it was too late.

156
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:57,366
My husband's fire company.

157
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:58,576
That's right.

158
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:02,246
After that, Leah's marriage fell apart.

159
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:03,756
She couldn't hold a job.

160
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,882
Some days, she could
barely get out of bed.

161
00:08:05,906 --> 00:08:07,586
Basically, all the terrible things

162
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:09,086
you think would happen to someone

163
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:11,990
after the worst thing
imaginable happens to them.

164
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,806
So, I got her a job.

165
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:16,886
I own a catering company.

166
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:18,976
Found her a place to live, and

167
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,726
it took time, but slowly,

168
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,606
she began to put her life back together.

169
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:25,436
And then what happened?

170
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:29,276
A few weeks ago, we were on a job,

171
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:32,906
a birthday party for a nine-year-old boy.

172
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:35,946
He would've been the
same age as your nephew.

173
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:37,456
Same birthday.

174
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,456
Look, as soon as I realized,

175
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:42,336
I tried to send Leah
home, but she insisted

176
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,546
that I was being silly,
that she could handle it.

177
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:49,256
And four days later,
she's calling me from jail.

178
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:54,716
She has become convinced
that this boy is her son

179
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:58,686
and that he was stolen
from her by this other mother.

180
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:01,016
And I've tried to reason with her,

181
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,476
but she just says, "Gary,
you don't understand.

182
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,896
You weren't there that night."

183
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,936
So you went looking for someone

184
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,500
who was there that night.

185
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,787
I don't know what I expected him to do.

186
00:09:14,811 --> 00:09:17,616
Maybe I'm just desperate.

187
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,906
She won't listen to me.

188
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:24,036
And I thought maybe, just maybe,

189
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:25,520
she would listen to him.

190
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:32,870
Do you think she might listen to me?

191
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,346
First, I'd like to start by
offering my condolences.

192
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:47,356
Words cannot express how sorry I am.

193
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:51,526
The lafd lost an exceptional firefighter,

194
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:54,736
and we all lost an exceptional person.

195
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:58,156
I'm not here to take
his place. No one can.

196
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:00,286
And I'm not gonna be
returning as your captain.

197
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:03,956
I'm just here to get you
through this difficult transition

198
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:07,546
until chief Simpson can
appoint a candidate more worthy.

199
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:10,086
My goal

200
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,966
is to keep things running
smoothly while I'm here

201
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:16,466
and to support you in this difficult time.

202
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:20,846
I know that whatever I say isn't
gonna make any of this better.

203
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:27,476
But I would like to say a
few words about captain Nash

204
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,420
and what he meant to me personally.

205
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:48,287
Right.

206
00:10:48,311 --> 00:10:50,190
One of these.

207
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:53,876
I want co2 and a hand
line on that engine.

208
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:56,006
Buckley, kill the batteries,

209
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:58,596
stabilize the vehicles
and start extrication.

210
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:00,806
- Yeah.
- Wilson, you get her.

211
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:04,170
Han, you get... Him.

212
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:14,106
Thanks. That was getting annoying.

213
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:16,236
Lafd, sir. Is your seat belt jammed?

214
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:18,850
Yeah. This crazy lady
came out of nowhere.

215
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:24,496
That jerk blew through the red light.

216
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:27,166
Ma'am, were you unconscious?

217
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:29,876
No, but I might black out from rage.

218
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:30,837
Does your neck hurt at all?

219
00:11:30,861 --> 00:11:32,666
Nope.

220
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:34,256
Sir, I need to check your pupils. Sir?

221
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,126
I bet she was on her phone.

222
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:38,086
Yeah, you can see here

223
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:40,216
where she totally smashed my grille.

224
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,596
Sir, I really need to examine you,

225
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:42,926
especially because
you seem very litigious.

226
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:44,410
Sir?

227
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:47,806
Here we are.

228
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:52,026
Wow, first he t-bones me, now he's tmz.

229
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:54,316
Smile. Tell the camera why you did it.

230
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:56,356
Excuse me? You're the one who hit me.

231
00:11:56,380 --> 00:12:00,196
Let the record show
this was not my fault.

232
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,220
Are you kidding?

233
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:04,116
This is 100% your fault.

234
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,286
That's your car, that's her car

235
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:07,916
and that's a "t" that you boned.

236
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:09,496
This is all your fault.

237
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,916
Whoa.

238
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:11,996
So, if you'll kindly sit your ass down,

239
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:13,166
I can check you for a head injury,

240
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:14,626
make sure you don't bleed out and die.

241
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:16,926
Han, a word.

242
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:18,910
Yeah, that's right. Yeah.

243
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:22,426
What, you gonna give me
a lecture on comportment?

244
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:25,016
No, a chance to cool off.

245
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,726
You mean a time out. No, thanks!

246
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,186
I'll just scrub the crapper.

247
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:31,476
I know you're hurting. I am, too.

248
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,766
You know, you shouldn't even be here?

249
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:34,276
What right do you have to run

250
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:37,050
the 118? You are not half
the man that Bobby was.

251
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:42,326
Be that as it may, I am your captain.

252
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:44,696
Only because I killed our last one,

253
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,350
so I'd be very careful if I was you.

254
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:03,886
Hello, Leah.

255
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:07,846
Um... Thank you for
agreeing to talk to me.

256
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:08,976
My name is Athena.

257
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,646
Gary told me you were coming.

258
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:12,146
He said you're a police officer.

259
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:14,106
That's not why I'm here.

260
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:16,090
Gary said you're captain Nash's widow.

261
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:18,646
Yes.

262
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:21,656
I'm so sorry. He was a good man.

263
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,890
He was.

264
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:31,166
Leah, your brother, he's
very worried about you.

265
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:34,586
Well, he thinks I'm crazy. I'm not crazy.

266
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:37,132
I just did what any
mother would've done.

267
00:13:37,156 --> 00:13:39,006
Probably went about
it the wrong way, but...

268
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:41,546
Can you tell me about this boy?

269
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:44,466
- Micah.
- The police report,

270
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:47,266
they say that his name
is Cameron Myers.

271
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:48,976
Well, of course the
police report says that

272
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,397
because that's what
she's been calling him,

273
00:13:50,421 --> 00:13:52,306
but my son's name is Micah.

274
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:55,606
And why do you think
that this boy is your son?

275
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:57,726
I wasn't certain at first.

276
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:59,986
I mean, I kept telling myself,
"you must be imagining things."

277
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:02,367
Excuse me? Do you
have any more bags?

278
00:14:02,391 --> 00:14:05,026
He looked so much like Micah.

279
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:07,090
I couldn't catch my breath for a moment.

280
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,202
And then I asked him his name.

281
00:14:10,226 --> 00:14:11,286
What's your name?

282
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:12,496
I'm Cameron.

283
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,832
It's my little boy's birthday today, too.

284
00:14:14,856 --> 00:14:15,916
How old is he?

285
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:17,876
Nine, just like you.

286
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,416
I would've chalked the whole thing up

287
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,466
to some crazy coincidence
until I handed him the bag

288
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:23,620
and I saw the birthmark.

289
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:28,556
This tiny little heart on
the inside of his wrist.

290
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:31,976
I kissed that birthmark every night

291
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,596
when I put Micah to bed.

292
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:38,396
I used to tell him it
connected his heart to mine,

293
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:42,026
and that it meant that,
no matter where he went,

294
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:44,276
he would always carry my love with him.

295
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:47,076
And that's when you knew for sure?

296
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:49,702
That's when I allowed for the possibility.

297
00:14:49,726 --> 00:14:52,470
And I kept saying to
myself, "you're crazy."

298
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:55,416
"This can't be real.

299
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,280
I mean, you don't even
know these people."

300
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,490
But turns out I did.

301
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,336
You recognized her?

302
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,586
Prenatal yoga.

303
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:08,426
9:00 A.M., Tuesdays and Fridays.

304
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:10,346
You were in prenatal
yoga class together?

305
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:13,266
Yes, until she stopped attending.

306
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:15,016
I remember some of
the other mothers saying

307
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,896
they'd heard her
pregnancy ran into trouble

308
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,066
and that she'd lost the baby.

309
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:21,737
And that's when you began to think

310
00:15:21,761 --> 00:15:24,196
that she went after yours.

311
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:25,276
I mean, I've heard stories of women

312
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,906
so desperate to have a baby

313
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:29,406
they'll even cut one
out of another woman.

314
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:33,196
So, how much easier...
wait till the baby's born,

315
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:37,286
steal him from his crib... Start a fire.

316
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:38,996
Exactly.

317
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:41,166
If you're desperate
enough, you'll do things

318
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:43,506
you never thought you
were capable of doing.

319
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:45,126
You got this!

320
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:47,320
Whoo! Come on, honey!

321
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:51,070
That's my son.

322
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:55,386
I'll race him, though you're
not coming back from that.

323
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:56,790
No recovery.

324
00:15:57,870 --> 00:15:58,910
Cameron.

325
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:03,567
Hi.

326
00:16:03,591 --> 00:16:04,856
I'm Leah.

327
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,356
Your mom asked me to pick you up.

328
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:08,236
Mom says I'm not supposed
to go with strangers.

329
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:10,576
Sweetie, I'm not a stranger.

330
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,576
I was at your birthday party, remember?

331
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,116
Yeah.

332
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,640
I'd love you to meet my son.

333
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:18,826
Come on.

334
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:20,746
- Excuse me! Cameron?
- Come on, honey.

335
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:21,707
- What are you doing?
- It's okay, honey.

336
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:23,206
Mom?

337
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:25,020
- Come here, sweetie.
- Cameron. Who are you?

338
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:27,086
It's Leah.

339
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:28,216
Okay, honey, stay here.

340
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,346
Your name is Micah.
Okay? You're my son,

341
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:33,017
- not hers.
- Mom, mom, what's she talking about?

342
00:16:33,041 --> 00:16:34,926
Honey, I don't know. She's crazy.

343
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:36,226
- Help!
- You stole my son!

344
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:38,306
- Sir!
- Don't let her leave.

345
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,396
This psycho tried to abduct my child!

346
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:42,186
- Micah!
- I'm calling 911.

347
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:43,516
Don't be scared, baby. Don't be scared.

348
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:46,146
- Hey. Just calm down.
- She stole my son!

349
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:50,446
I know what I did was
reckless and stupid.

350
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:52,946
But I'm not wrong.

351
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:54,600
I thought I buried my son.

352
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:57,100
But I didn't.

353
00:16:58,390 --> 00:17:00,060
He's alive.

354
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,456
You think I'm crazy?

355
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,900
No.

356
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:09,006
And I promise you this.

357
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:15,160
That if your son is alive,
I'll bring him back to you.

358
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:18,500
I swear it.

359
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:38,030
She posted every single day

360
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:41,266
until march 17.

361
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:44,130
And then, not again until may 9.

362
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,646
That's six weeks missing.

363
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:52,526
So... Maybe she did lose her baby,

364
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:55,180
but not before he was born.

365
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:29,380
Are you gonna start a podcast?

366
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:33,566
I think I almost got it figured out.

367
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:35,446
Something happened

368
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:39,156
to Heather's baby within these six weeks.

369
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:41,866
Her not posting things
on the Internet isn't quite

370
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:44,956
the evidentiary bombshell
that you seem to think it is.

371
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:47,047
Well, even after she
started posting again,

372
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:49,126
things were different.

373
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:51,502
The cute matching outfits were gone,

374
00:19:51,526 --> 00:19:53,166
no more daily photo shoots

375
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:55,626
and she stopped showing his face.

376
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:57,256
Well, maybe she
realized that the Internet

377
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,676
was full of "creepy-ass stalkers."

378
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:02,137
I'm quoting you, -in
case you don't remember.

379
00:20:02,161 --> 00:20:02,676
Look,

380
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:05,136
if you are not going to be helpful,

381
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,200
go haunt someone else. I'm busy.

382
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:12,402
Aren't you supposed to be
busy planning my funeral?

383
00:20:12,426 --> 00:20:14,066
I heard it's gonna be big.

384
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:16,986
Yeah, a hero's burial.

385
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:19,566
That's what the chief calls it.

386
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:21,576
They already got a
template they can follow,

387
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,190
they don't need me.

388
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,310
But this woman does?

389
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:29,576
Helping her is so important

390
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,876
that you're hiding in here,
racking up 11 missed phone calls

391
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,796
and 42 unread texts?

392
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:36,466
You're the one who locked
himself in a lab to die.

393
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:39,006
You don't get to tell me
how to spend my time.

394
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:40,160
Ouch.

395
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:47,846
This woman, her loss,
it was important to you.

396
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:49,596
You would've helped her.

397
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:51,266
I'm doing it because you can't.

398
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:53,250
- How can you know that?
- I know you.

399
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,646
You knew me.

400
00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:59,380
Past tense.

401
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,336
Hi.

402
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,570
Hey.

403
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,506
I don't see jee. What time is it?

404
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:23,070
She went down about half an hour ago.

405
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:28,056
Hey, you've been gone for a while.

406
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,476
Did you go for another run?

407
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:32,186
No.

408
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:33,686
I tried out that new yoga studio.

409
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:36,816
You know, they've got this
yoga for runners program.

410
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,776
Great. So, another hobby

411
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:41,040
that will keep you out of
the house for hours at a time.

412
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:44,326
That's not what I'm doing, Maddie.

413
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:46,492
You're shutting me out,
which is the one thing

414
00:21:46,516 --> 00:21:48,366
that we promised each
other we would not do.

415
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:49,866
And please don't insult my intelligence

416
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:52,270
by pretending like that's
not what's happening.

417
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:57,110
- Running just...
- Helps me to... -not think?

418
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,176
Chim, that's the thing about running.

419
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,676
There's never gonna
be anywhere far enough.

420
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:06,596
You carry the pain with
you, and eventually, it...

421
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:08,596
Takes you down.

422
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:10,500
I think maybe it already did.

423
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,646
And I'm not trying to shut you out.

424
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:15,027
I'm just trying to figure out

425
00:22:15,051 --> 00:22:16,960
how to get back up on my feet, that's all.

426
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:24,776
It's 8:07 A.M.,

427
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:27,786
and we are exhuming the
grave of Micah Hamilton

428
00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:30,246
in order to obtain a DNA sample.

429
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:32,372
Okay, I'm going to go check on the doc.

430
00:22:32,396 --> 00:22:33,826
You keep recording.

431
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:35,060
Got it, sergeant.

432
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:45,336
I got it. Gary, what are you doing here?

433
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,006
I came to put an end to this insanity.

434
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:48,556
- Wh...
- you're digging up a baby's grave?

435
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:50,727
Gary, it's the only way
that we can be sure.

436
00:22:50,751 --> 00:22:52,636
No, I am sure.

437
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:55,000
My sister's crazy.
Clearly, it is contagious.

438
00:22:57,130 --> 00:22:59,010
I'm gonna put an end to this.

439
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,736
Stop, stop. No, this
is my nephew's casket.

440
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:04,906
- Sir...
- I don't consent to this.

441
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:06,366
I'm very sorry for your loss

442
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:07,906
but I've been hired by the child's mother.

443
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:08,907
Please, let me do my job.

444
00:23:08,931 --> 00:23:10,326
No, you don't understand

445
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:11,406
- what you're doing.
- Gary, you really

446
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:12,826
shouldn't be here for this part.

447
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:14,456
I can call you with the results.

448
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,547
There aren't going to be any results.

449
00:23:15,571 --> 00:23:16,626
What?

450
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:18,400
The casket is... empty.

451
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:24,940
We didn't know how to tell my sister.

452
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:27,780
The fire, it just...

453
00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:31,910
There was nothing left to Bury.

454
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:44,840
Are you okay?

455
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,566
Henrietta?

456
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:50,446
What the hell?

457
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:52,906
What are you doing
skulking around my house?

458
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:55,206
I'm checking on you, Athena.

459
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:58,626
I guess chimney asked you to do this?

460
00:23:58,650 --> 00:24:01,416
You got to check up on the little widow.

461
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,650
Your kids, actually.

462
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,876
You haven't been
returning their phone calls,

463
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,926
their text messages.

464
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:11,426
The chief's office said that you haven't

465
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:13,410
finalized any of the plans for the funeral.

466
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:18,516
And then I come here and... And what?

467
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:21,476
I mean, should I start with

468
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,976
the air mattress in the corner and

469
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,130
or the wall of crazy over here?

470
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:32,616
I was helping this woman.

471
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,196
Leah.

472
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:36,996
She lost her baby in a
house fire eight years ago.

473
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:38,746
She thought that the
fire might have been

474
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:40,706
a cover for the real crime.

475
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:42,336
A kidnapping.

476
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:45,046
They stole her baby and
then set the house on fire?

477
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:47,586
I figured we start by
proving that the baby

478
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:50,336
that Leah buried wasn't hers,

479
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:53,596
so we exhumed the
grave, and it was empty.

480
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:58,920
Yeah, just some sandbags...
And a baby picture.

481
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,460
That is sad.

482
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:05,146
But not a huge surprise.
I mean, a fire so hot

483
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:07,566
and a... a baby so small?

484
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:10,196
I'm surprised the mother
didn't say something

485
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:11,577
before the exhumation.

486
00:25:11,601 --> 00:25:12,986
She didn't know.

487
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:15,076
Her brother and her husband,

488
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:17,826
they decided without consulting her.

489
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:21,036
Because it would just
upset her even more.

490
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:24,836
So they decided,
because they knew best.

491
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:26,320
I mean, who does that?

492
00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:30,716
If you love someone,
you're honest with them.

493
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:32,466
You respect them.

494
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:36,266
You trust that they can
make the hard decisions.

495
00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:41,556
You don't just blindside
them and then take off!

496
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:46,566
You don't leave them to
deal with the-the-the mess!

497
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:47,606
Alone!

498
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:52,736
Athena... He's not
supposed to be dead, hen.

499
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:55,736
He stood here in this
kitchen that morning,

500
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,616
planning our future.

501
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:01,456
And then he just... Left?

502
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,826
He left me.

503
00:26:03,850 --> 00:26:05,456
He didn't want to.

504
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,690
And he did anyway!

505
00:26:22,410 --> 00:26:24,580
Hello?

506
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:27,066
Hi.

507
00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:28,566
Is your mom home?

508
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:30,970
Mom, it's for you!

509
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:43,076
Gary said you exhumed the grave.

510
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:45,230
He was so mad I gave you permission.

511
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:49,126
It wasn't my son in there, was it?

512
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:50,690
No.

513
00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:52,836
I knew it.

514
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:53,926
Leah?

515
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:55,676
There was nothing.

516
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:58,426
Just an empty casket.

517
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:01,176
With a photo of your beautiful baby.

518
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,936
Evidently, after the
fire, there was nothing

519
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,606
- left to Bury.
- No.

520
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:08,527
There was nothing there
because my son isn't dead.

521
00:27:08,551 --> 00:27:10,146
He didn't die in a fire.

522
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:11,686
That woman has him.

523
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:14,776
I have DNA test results here.

524
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,696
There was a match.

525
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,076
A match to what?

526
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:19,366
You said there was nothing there.

527
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:21,906
Not to what we didn't
find in Micah's grave.

528
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:26,246
These are DNA results
from buccal swabs

529
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:31,296
taken from Cameron Myers
and his mother, Heather Myers.

530
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,887
I went to them, explained the situation,

531
00:27:32,911 --> 00:27:34,926
and she agreed to it.

532
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:38,256
We tested Cameron, his DNA,

533
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:40,136
against your sample and hers.

534
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:43,976
Hers... Was a match.

535
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,806
That little boy is her son.

536
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:50,066
Micah... Is gone.

537
00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:51,476
I'm so sorry.

538
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,606
But I was so sure.

539
00:27:53,630 --> 00:28:00,430
When I saw him, I was
sure, I... I felt it, I felt him.

540
00:28:03,810 --> 00:28:05,786
You think I imagined all of it.

541
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:09,456
I think that you were overcome by grief.

542
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:12,860
For a moment, you
let yourself believe that

543
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:17,466
miracles were possible.

544
00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:20,290
I feel like I'm losing him all over again.

545
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:27,266
The district attorney,
he's willing to consider

546
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:29,476
a diversion program.

547
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:32,670
If you comply, your
charges could be dismissed.

548
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:36,646
And you could get back to your life.

549
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:38,986
What life?

550
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:41,300
Leah, you've lost a lot, but

551
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,560
you haven't lost everything.

552
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:55,006
I can see why he loved you.

553
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:57,120
I'm sorry he's gone.

554
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,280
He was a special person.

555
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:11,960
I want to say how
sorry I am for your loss.

556
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:16,566
I know how enormous the
pain of losing a child can be.

557
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:18,396
Really?

558
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:20,566
How many children have you lost?

559
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:22,590
Two.

560
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,600
- I'm sorry.
- You don't have to apologize.

561
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:33,036
I'm the man who was supposed
to save your son and I didn't.

562
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:34,900
You don't owe me anything.

563
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:39,716
What were their names?

564
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:43,136
Robert and brook.

565
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,806
11 and nine.

566
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:48,136
My baby was Micah.

567
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,306
That's a nice name, I will pray for him.

568
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:51,790
Thank you.

569
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,516
Can I ask you something?

570
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:56,330
Yeah, sure.

571
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,856
How do you keep going?

572
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:03,340
How... I.

573
00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:10,100
I live in the belief that one
day I will see them again.

574
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:13,076
And you really believe it?

575
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:14,600
With all my heart.

576
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:17,740
I do.

577
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:38,646
Hello? Is someone there?

578
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:39,710
It's just us.

579
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,156
What are you doing here?

580
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:46,696
We bumped into Mrs.
Anderson at the grocery store.

581
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,326
And she asked us why no one
told her that we'd moved back in.

582
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:50,912
Yeah, but don't worry.

583
00:30:50,936 --> 00:30:52,140
We covered for you.

584
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:54,900
Come here.

585
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:06,756
Now, what's for dinner?

586
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:08,820
Well...

587
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:11,500
We have breakfast.

588
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:15,817
And we also brought some sleeping bags

589
00:31:15,841 --> 00:31:17,556
so we can stay with you.

590
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:19,580
Like the way we used to
camp out in the backyard.

591
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:23,196
You would do that?

592
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:25,026
Mom, we love you.

593
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:26,840
Even more than running water.

594
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,656
And I love you, too.

595
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:37,036
And, um... After dinner, I can,

596
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:38,706
I can show you some photos

597
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:41,296
of the place that I found for Bobby.

598
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:43,046
- You found a place?
- Yeah.

599
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:45,410
I think it's perfect.

600
00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:53,386
Hey, it's not locked.

601
00:31:53,410 --> 00:31:55,686
You know I'm not a
probie anymore, right?

602
00:31:55,710 --> 00:31:55,985
Yeah.

603
00:31:56,009 --> 00:31:58,186
Then why am I still picking
up your dry cleaning?

604
00:31:58,210 --> 00:32:01,760
Because I had to go to the
airport and pick up this one.

605
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:07,906
Good to see you, rav.

606
00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:09,742
It's great to see you, too, man.

607
00:32:09,766 --> 00:32:11,718
I wish it were under
different circumstances.

608
00:32:11,742 --> 00:32:12,036
Yeah.

609
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:13,446
We all do.

610
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:14,906
I should've been there.

611
00:32:14,930 --> 00:32:16,326
Hey.

612
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:18,060
You're here now.

613
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:31,700
Help.

614
00:32:33,490 --> 00:32:35,266
Hen?

615
00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:37,686
The, purse.

616
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:40,146
Clutch.

617
00:32:40,170 --> 00:32:42,460
- I don't know.
- Come here.

618
00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:49,130
You're okay.

619
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:55,746
That looks good.

620
00:32:55,770 --> 00:32:56,956
What is that?

621
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:57,996
I think it's a crumpet.

622
00:32:58,020 --> 00:32:59,876
There's plenty. You want one?

623
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:02,280
Nah, I'd probably just end up wearing it.

624
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:06,546
You know, I've never
done one of these before.

625
00:33:06,570 --> 00:33:08,796
I mean, you were in the military, too.

626
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,676
Guess you've done a lot of 'em?

627
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:12,330
Not like this.

628
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:17,676
Okay.

629
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:19,346
You ready?

630
00:33:19,370 --> 00:33:21,330
As we'll ever be.

631
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:26,170
Hey, Maddie.

632
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:32,566
Yeah, yeah, no, that-that's fine.

633
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:34,010
I will.

634
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:39,576
Hey, Ravi, do you mind
driving Eddie to the church?

635
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,956
I'll meet you guys there.

636
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:42,246
- Everything okay?
- Yeah, I just,

637
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:44,270
I have to pick something
up for the service.

638
00:33:54,570 --> 00:33:57,386
This is a private party, Buckley, go away.

639
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:59,306
I can't do that.

640
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:02,016
Made a promise to a pregnant lady.

641
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,476
Yeah? Well, I'm guessing
she's getting pretty used

642
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,816
to broken promises these days.

643
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:08,936
Come on, chim.

644
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,816
Put down the drink and let's go.

645
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,630
We're gonna be late.

646
00:34:14,930 --> 00:34:16,736
To my own funeral?

647
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,746
No, wait.

648
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:20,826
Not my funeral.

649
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:23,246
Just should have been.

650
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:25,876
That's not fair.

651
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:27,626
No one blames you.

652
00:34:27,650 --> 00:34:29,206
Hey.

653
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:30,666
I don't blame me, either.

654
00:34:30,690 --> 00:34:32,626
I blame him.

655
00:34:32,650 --> 00:34:36,466
Bobby had no right
to keep us in the dark.

656
00:34:36,490 --> 00:34:40,136
He just decided for everyone
how things were gonna go.

657
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:42,976
And I kind of hate him for that.

658
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,896
You don't mean that.

659
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:47,066
Yeah, buck, I do.

660
00:34:47,090 --> 00:34:48,630
He should have told us the truth.

661
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:55,497
It wouldn't have changed anything.

662
00:34:55,521 --> 00:34:57,156
It might have.

663
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:59,656
There's always the third option, buck.

664
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,206
You know, when you're out
in the field and you only have

665
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:05,337
two bad options to choose
from, you do not accept that.

666
00:35:05,361 --> 00:35:07,626
You do not let those be the only

667
00:35:07,650 --> 00:35:09,086
two crappy options available.

668
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:11,296
You always find the third way.

669
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:13,137
You know who taught us that?

670
00:35:13,161 --> 00:35:14,756
Yeah, Bobby did.

671
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:18,716
And we always did that,
time after time after time.

672
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:20,136
We never gave up.

673
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,516
We always found a third way.

674
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:23,710
And we always did it together.

675
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:32,080
And you think there was a third way?

676
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:39,680
I spent the last two
weeks thinking on it.

677
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,310
I came up with nothing.

678
00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:51,376
Buck, he gave his life so I could live.

679
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,650
I'm just not sure what I'm
supposed to do with that.

680
00:35:57,660 --> 00:36:00,160
I think you're just supposed to live.

681
00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:04,000
Yeah.

682
00:36:52,290 --> 00:36:54,670
Of all the days

683
00:36:57,260 --> 00:37:00,890
this is the one you choose
to leave me to go it alone.

684
00:37:04,350 --> 00:37:06,326
On this day, we gather here

685
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:08,286
to celebrate the life and legacy

686
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:10,900
of captain Robert Wade Nash.

687
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:17,296
A day filled with heaviness
that weighs on us all

688
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:19,320
as we gather in this sacred space.

689
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:24,530
A day marked by
gratitude for the life we lost

690
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:27,530
and the many lives saved.

691
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:30,896
As we reflect on his service,

692
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:33,237
we remember the
countless lives he touched,

693
00:37:33,261 --> 00:37:39,300
the friendships he forged
and the sacrifices he made.

694
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:43,236
Captain Nash was
more than a firefighter.

695
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:44,946
He was a mentor.

696
00:37:44,970 --> 00:37:47,786
A husband. A father.

697
00:37:47,810 --> 00:37:51,320
And for so many of us, a beloved friend.

698
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,956
There are many
traditions in the fire service.

699
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:58,650
Among those traditions
is the sound of a bell.

700
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:01,756
It was the bell

701
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:05,046
that signaled the
beginning of that day's shift.

702
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:08,596
Each alarm was sounded by a bell

703
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:12,646
which summoned these brave
souls to put their lives on the line

704
00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:14,646
for the good of others.

705
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:17,146
And when the alarm had
come to an end, it was a bell

706
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:20,606
that signaled the completion of that call.

707
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:23,986
When a firefighter
fell in the line of duty,

708
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:26,986
an officer would tap out a special signal:

709
00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:28,286
Ten bells.

710
00:38:28,310 --> 00:38:31,996
This signal would be
heard by all station houses,

711
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:35,956
notifying them of the
passing of one of their own.

712
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:40,780
It is customary and
fitting that the final alarm

713
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:44,216
be sounded for our brother,

714
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:47,030
captain Robert Wade Nash.

715
00:38:48,490 --> 00:38:52,556
He has completed his
duties... a job well done

716
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:55,080
and has now returned home.

717
00:38:56,790 --> 00:38:59,210
Uniformed personnel, please stand.

718
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:05,866
Atten-hut!

719
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:08,100
Present arms.

720
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,880
Order arms.

721
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:38,370
Rest easy.

722
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:42,726
You're home now, baby.

723
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:44,590
You're home.
