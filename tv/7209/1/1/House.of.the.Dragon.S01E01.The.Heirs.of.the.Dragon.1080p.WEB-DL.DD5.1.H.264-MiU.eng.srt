1
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:08,000
As the first century
of the Targaryen dynasty

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:08,720
As the first century
of the Targaryen dynasty

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,240
came to a close

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,000
the health of the Old King,
Jaehaerys, was failing.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:14,720
the health of the Old King,
Jaehaerys, was failing.

6
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:20,000
In those days, House Targaryen
stood at the height of its strength

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,639
In those days, House Targaryen
stood at the height of its strength

8
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:24,519
with ten adult dragons
under its yoke.

9
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:26,000
No power in the world
could stand against it.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,800
No power in the world
could stand against it.

11
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,599
King Jaehaerys
reigned over nearly 60 years

12
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:32,000
of peace and prosperity

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,520
of peace and prosperity

14
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,599
but tragedy had claimed
both his sons

15
00:00:36,679 --> 00:00:38,000
leaving his succession in doubt.

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:38,760
leaving his succession in doubt.

17
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,720
So, in the year 101

18
00:00:41,799 --> 00:00:44,000
the Old King called a Great Council
to choose an heir.

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,639
the Old King called a Great Council
to choose an heir.

20
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:50,000
Over a thousand lords
made the journey to Harrenhal.

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:50,240
Over a thousand lords
made the journey to Harrenhal.

22
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,320
Fourteen succession claims were heard

23
00:00:54,919 --> 00:00:56,000
but only two were truly considered.

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,480
but only two were truly considered.

25
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:02,000
Princess Rhaenys Targaryen,
the King's eldest descendant

26
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:02,120
Princess Rhaenys Targaryen,
the King's eldest descendant

27
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:05,720
and her younger cousin,
Prince Viserys Targaryen

28
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:08,000
the King's eldest male descendant.

29
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,440
the King's eldest male descendant.

30
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,320
It is declared by all lords paramount

31
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,000
and lords vassal
of the Seven Kingdoms

32
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,560
and lords vassal
of the Seven Kingdoms

33
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:26,000
that Prince Viserys Targaryen
be made Prince of Dragonstone!

34
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,919
that Prince Viserys Targaryen
be made Prince of Dragonstone!

35
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:32,000
Rhaenys, a woman,
would not inherit the Iron Throne.

36
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,279
Rhaenys, a woman,
would not inherit the Iron Throne.

37
00:01:37,839 --> 00:01:38,000
The lords instead chose Viserys

38
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,040
The lords instead chose Viserys

39
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,000
my father.

40
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:48,160
Jaehaerys called the Great Council

41
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,000
to prevent a war being fought
over his succession.

42
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,480
to prevent a war being fought
over his succession.

43
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,759
For he knew the cold truth.

44
00:01:53,839 --> 00:01:56,000
The only thing that could tear down
the House of the Dragon

45
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,200
The only thing that could tear down
the House of the Dragon

46
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,960
was itself.

47
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,719
Dohaeras,  Syrax!

48
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:54,400
Umbas.

49
00:03:55,719 --> 00:03:56,000
Rybas!

50
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,840
Rybas!

51
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:11,359
Welcome back, Princess.
I trust your ride was pleasant.

52
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:13,280
Try not to look too relieved, ser.

53
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:14,000
I am relieved.

54
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,720
I am relieved.

55
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,520
Every time that golden beast
brings you back unspoiled

56
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,639
it saves my head from a spike.

57
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,600
Syrax is growing quickly.

58
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,519
She'll soon be as large as Caraxes.

59
00:04:24,679 --> 00:04:26,000
That's almost large enough
to saddle two.

60
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,560
That's almost large enough
to saddle two.

61
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:29,480
I believe I'm quite content
as a spectator, thank you.

62
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,399
Dohaeras.

63
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:36,879
Naejot!

64
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,000
Rhaenyra.

65
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,560
Rhaenyra.

66
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,080
You know I don't like you
to go flying

67
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,639
while I'm in this condition.

68
00:06:07,719 --> 00:06:08,000
You don't like me to go flying
while you're in any condition.

69
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,960
You don't like me to go flying
while you're in any condition.

70
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:14,000
- Your Grace.
- Good morrow, Alicent.

71
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,800
- Your Grace.
- Good morrow, Alicent.

72
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,040
Did you sleep?

73
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,000
- I slept.
- How long?

74
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,000
I don't need mothering, Rhaenyra.

75
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,240
I don't need mothering, Rhaenyra.

76
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,480
Well, here you are,
surrounded by attendants

77
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,080
all focused on the babe.

78
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:26,000
Someone has to attend to you.

79
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,679
Someone has to attend to you.

80
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:32,000
You will lie in this bed
soon enough, Rhaenyra.

81
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
You will lie in this bed
soon enough, Rhaenyra.

82
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:36,639
This discomfort
is how we serve the realm.

83
00:06:36,719 --> 00:06:38,000
I'd rather serve as a knight
and ride to battle and glory.

84
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,760
I'd rather serve as a knight
and ride to battle and glory.

85
00:06:42,559 --> 00:06:44,000
We have royal wombs, you and I.

86
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,680
We have royal wombs, you and I.

87
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,480
The childbed is our battlefield.

88
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,799
We must learn to face it
with a stiff lip.

89
00:06:54,599 --> 00:06:56,000
Now take a bath.

90
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,200
Now take a bath.

91
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,200
You stink of dragon.

92
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:01,799
So, I said to him, "Well, I believe

93
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:02,000
you might be looking up
the wrong end."

94
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,840
you might be looking up
the wrong end."

95
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,000
My lords.

96
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,960
My lords.

97
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,520
The growing alliance
among the Free Cities

98
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,799
has taken to styling itself
the Triarchy.

99
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:14,000
They have massed on Bloodstone

100
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
They have massed on Bloodstone

101
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,600
and are presently
ridding the Stepstones

102
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,120
of its pirate infestation.

103
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,000
Well, that sounds suspiciously
like good news, Lord Corlys.

104
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,720
Well, that sounds suspiciously
like good news, Lord Corlys.

105
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,759
A man called Craghas Drahar

106
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:26,000
has styled himself the prince-admiral
of this Triarchy.

107
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,680
has styled himself the prince-admiral
of this Triarchy.

108
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,560
They call him the Crabfeeder

109
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,000
due to his inventive methods
of punishing his enemies.

110
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
due to his inventive methods
of punishing his enemies.

111
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,439
And are we meant to weep
for dead pirates?

112
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,000
- No, Your Grace.
- Rhaenyra, you're late.

113
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,480
- No, Your Grace.
- Rhaenyra, you're late.

114
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,160
The King's cupbearer
must not be late.

115
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,040
- Leaves people wanting for cups.
- I was visiting Mother.

116
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,839
On dragonback?

117
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,679
Hey, Your Grace,
at Prince Daemon's urging

118
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,000
the crown has invested
significant capital

119
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,200
the crown has invested
significant capital

120
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:55,599
in the re-training and re-equipping
of his City Watch.

121
00:07:55,679 --> 00:07:56,000
I thought you might urge your brother
to fill his seat on the council

122
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,720
I thought you might urge your brother
to fill his seat on the council

123
00:07:59,799 --> 00:08:02,000
and provide an assessment
of his progress

124
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:02,480
and provide an assessment
of his progress

125
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,520
as commander of the Watch.

126
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,960
Do you think Daemon
is distracted by his present tasks?

127
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,000
And that his thoughts
and energies are occupied?

128
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,080
And that his thoughts
and energies are occupied?

129
00:08:09,159 --> 00:08:12,280
Well, one would hope so,
considering the associated costs.

130
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,000
Then let us all consider your gold
well-invested, Lord Beesbury.

131
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,480
Then let us all consider your gold
well-invested, Lord Beesbury.

132
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:18,519
I would urge that you not allow
this Triarchy much latitude

133
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:20,000
in the Stepstones, Your Grace.

134
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,160
in the Stepstones, Your Grace.

135
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,720
If those shipping lanes should fall,
it will beggar our ports.

136
00:08:23,799 --> 00:08:26,000
The crown has heard
your report, Lord Corlys

137
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,440
The crown has heard
your report, Lord Corlys

138
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,439
and takes it under advisement.

139
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:37,200
Shall we discuss
the Heir's Tournament, Your Grace?

140
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,000
I would be delighted.

141
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,679
I would be delighted.

142
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,680
Will the maesters' name day
prediction hold, Mellos?

143
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:44,000
You must understand that these things
are mere estimations, my King

144
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,199
You must understand that these things
are mere estimations, my King

145
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:48,519
but we have all been
poring over the moon charts

146
00:08:48,599 --> 00:08:50,000
and we feel that our forecast
is as accurate as it can be.

147
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,200
and we feel that our forecast
is as accurate as it can be.

148
00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:54,879
The cost of the tournament
is not negligible.

149
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,000
Perhaps we might delay
until the child is in hand?

150
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,200
Perhaps we might delay
until the child is in hand?

151
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:00,559
Most of the lords and knights

152
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:02,000
are certainly on their way to
King's Landing already.

153
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:02,320
are certainly on their way to
King's Landing already.

154
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,560
- To turn them back now...
- The tourney will take

155
00:09:03,639 --> 00:09:05,040
the better part of a week.

156
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,960
Before the games are over,
my son will be born

157
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,600
and the whole realm will celebrate.

158
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:12,719
We have no way of predicting
the sex of the child.

159
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:14,000
Of course, no maester's capable
of rendering an opinion

160
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,360
Of course, no maester's capable
of rendering an opinion

161
00:09:15,439 --> 00:09:16,879
free of conditions, are they now?

162
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,960
There's a boy in the Queen's belly.

163
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,800
I know it.

164
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:24,839
And my heir will soon put all of this

165
00:09:24,919 --> 00:09:26,000
damnable hand-wringing
to rest himself.

166
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,080
damnable hand-wringing
to rest himself.

167
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,000
He passed through
the Red Keep's gates at first light.

168
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,480
He passed through
the Red Keep's gates at first light.

169
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,160
Does my father know he's here?

170
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,560
- No.
- Good.

171
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,000
Gods be good.

172
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,960
Gods be good.

173
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,799
It's all right, ser.

174
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:08,000
Aye.

175
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,880
Aye.

176
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,639
I bought you something.

177
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,240
Do you know what it is?

178
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,160
It's Valyrian steel.

179
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,960
Like Dark Sister.

180
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,000
Turn around.

181
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,680
Turn around.

182
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,680
Now

183
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,000
you and I both own a small piece
of our ancestry.

184
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,480
you and I both own a small piece
of our ancestry.

185
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,879
- Did you read it?
- Of course, I read it.

186
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:31,200
When Princess Nymeria
arrived in Dorne

187
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,000
who did she take to husband?

188
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
who did she take to husband?

189
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,399
A man.

190
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,919
What was his name?

191
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,440
Lord Something.

192
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:41,080
If you answer with "Lord Something,"
Septa Marlow will be furious.

193
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,120
She's funny when she's furious.

194
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,480
You're always like this
when you're worried.

195
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:50,000
Like what?

196
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,480
Disagreeable.

197
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,000
You're worried your father
is about to overshadow you

198
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,480
You're worried your father
is about to overshadow you

199
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,759
with a son.

200
00:11:58,839 --> 00:12:00,559
I only worry for my mother.

201
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:02,000
I hope for my father
that he gets a son.

202
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,879
I hope for my father
that he gets a son.

203
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:07,080
As long as I can recall,
it's all he's wanted.

204
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,720
You want him to have a son?

205
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,919
I want to fly with you on dragonback

206
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,519
see the great wonders
across the Narrow Sea

207
00:12:13,599 --> 00:12:14,000
and eat only cake.

208
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:14,800
and eat only cake.

209
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,240
- I'm being serious.
- I never jest about cake.

210
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,440
You aren't worried about
your position?

211
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:20,000
I like this position.
It's quite comfortable.

212
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,279
I like this position.
It's quite comfortable.

213
00:12:25,799 --> 00:12:26,000
Where are you going?

214
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:26,960
Where are you going?

215
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,439
Home. The hour has grown late.

216
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,000
Princess Nymeria led her Rhoynar
across the Narrow Sea on 10,000 ships

217
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,080
Princess Nymeria led her Rhoynar
across the Narrow Sea on 10,000 ships

218
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,120
to flee their Valyrian pursuers.

219
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,000
She took Lord Mors Martell
of Dorne to husband

220
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,159
She took Lord Mors Martell
of Dorne to husband

221
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,040
and burned her own fleet off Sunspear

222
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,599
to show her people
that they were finished running.

223
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,200
- What are you doing?
- So you remember.

224
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,000
- If the Septa sees this book then...
- Fuck the Septa.

225
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,320
- If the Septa sees this book then...
- Fuck the Septa.

226
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:52,759
Rhaenyra!

227
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,280
Is it healing?

228
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,000
It has grown slightly, Your Grace.

229
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,159
It has grown slightly, Your Grace.

230
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,160
Can you say yet what it is?

231
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,000
We've sent inquiries to the Citadel.

232
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,399
We've sent inquiries to the Citadel.

233
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,520
They are searching the texts
for similar cases.

234
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,960
It's a small cut
from sitting the throne.

235
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,399
It's nothing.

236
00:13:21,879 --> 00:13:23,759
The King has been
under heavy stresses

237
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,559
preparing for the birth.

238
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:30,759
Bad humors of the mind
can adversely affect the body.

239
00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:32,000
Whatever it is,
it needs to be kept quiet.

240
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,960
Whatever it is,
it needs to be kept quiet.

241
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,000
We should leech it again, maester.

242
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:38,760
We should leech it again, maester.

243
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:41,480
It's a wound that refuses to heal,
Grand Maester.

244
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:44,000
Might I suggest cauterization?

245
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:44,280
Might I suggest cauterization?

246
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:48,360
Cauterization would be a wise
course of treatment, Your Grace.

247
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,000
- It will be painful...
- Fine.

248
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:50,240
- It will be painful...
- Fine.

249
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:52,839
Fine.

250
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,599
You spend more time in that bath
than I do on the throne.

251
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:12,120
This is the only place
I can find comfort these days.

252
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,439
It's tepid.

253
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,200
It's as warm
as the maesters will allow.

254
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:20,000
Don't they know dragons prefer heat?

255
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:20,320
Don't they know dragons prefer heat?

256
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:23,960
After this miserable pregnancy

257
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:26,000
I wouldn't be surprised
if I hatched an actual dragon.

258
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,520
I wouldn't be surprised
if I hatched an actual dragon.

259
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:30,000
And he will be loved and cherished.

260
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,000
Rhaenyra has already declared
that she is to have a sister.

261
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,960
Rhaenyra has already declared
that she is to have a sister.

262
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,200
Really?

263
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:38,000
- She even named her.
- Dare I ask?

264
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:38,400
- She even named her.
- Dare I ask?

265
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,560
Visenya.

266
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,480
She chose a dragon's egg
for the cradle

267
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:44,000
that she said reminded her of Vhagar.

268
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:44,280
that she said reminded her of Vhagar.

269
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,760
Gods be good.

270
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:48,080
This family already has its Visenya.

271
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,680
Has there been any word
from your dear brother?

272
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:55,440
Not since I named him
Commander of the City Watch.

273
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,520
I'm sure he will reemerge
for the tourney.

274
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,519
He could never
stay away from the lists.

275
00:15:01,599 --> 00:15:02,000
The tourney

276
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:02,880
The tourney

277
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:05,960
to celebrate the firstborn son
that we presently do not have.

278
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,000
You do understand

279
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:08,920
You do understand

280
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,759
nothing will cause the babe
to grow a cock

281
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:12,799
if it does not already possess one?

282
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,000
This child is a boy, Aemma.

283
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:14,960
This child is a boy, Aemma.

284
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:17,200
I'm certain of it.

285
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,000
I've never been
more certain of anything.

286
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:20,120
I've never been
more certain of anything.

287
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,879
The dream.

288
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,760
It was clearer than a memory.

289
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,000
Our son was born
wearing Aegon's iron crown.

290
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:32,440
Our son was born
wearing Aegon's iron crown.

291
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,719
When I heard the sound
of thundering hooves

292
00:15:37,799 --> 00:15:38,000
splintering shields,
and ringing swords

293
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,879
splintering shields,
and ringing swords

294
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:43,599
and I placed our son
upon the Iron Throne

295
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:49,639
as the bells of the Grand Sept tolled
and all the dragons roared as one.

296
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:55,080
Born wearing a crown?

297
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,000
Gods spare me,
birth is unpleasant enough as it is.

298
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,080
Gods spare me,
birth is unpleasant enough as it is.

299
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:08,000
This is the last time, Viserys.

300
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,120
This is the last time, Viserys.

301
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:14,000
I've lost one babe in the cradle,
had two stillbirths

302
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,600
I've lost one babe in the cradle,
had two stillbirths

303
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:19,879
and two pregnancies
ended well before their term.

304
00:16:22,359 --> 00:16:24,960
That's five in twice as many years.

305
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,439
I know it is my duty
to provide you an heir

306
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,879
and I'm sorry
if I have failed you in that.

307
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:32,000
I am.

308
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,159
I am.

309
00:16:36,599 --> 00:16:38,000
But I've mourned
all the dead children I can.

310
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,280
But I've mourned
all the dead children I can.

311
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,599
Commander on the floor!

312
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:08,000
When I took command of the Watch,
you were stray mongrels

313
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,480
When I took command of the Watch,
you were stray mongrels

314
00:17:12,919 --> 00:17:14,000
starving and undisciplined.

315
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
starving and undisciplined.

316
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:20,000
Now, you're a pack of hounds.

317
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:20,160
Now, you're a pack of hounds.

318
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,160
You're sated and honed for the hunt.

319
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,399
My brother's city
has fallen into squalor.

320
00:17:30,639 --> 00:17:32,000
Crime of every breed
has been allowed to thrive.

321
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,120
Crime of every breed
has been allowed to thrive.

322
00:17:35,839 --> 00:17:37,160
No longer.

323
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,000
Beginning tonight

324
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:38,240
Beginning tonight

325
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,200
King's Landing will learn
to fear the color gold.

326
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:26,000
Get up!

327
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:26,960
Get up!

328
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,120
Raper!

329
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,000
No! No... no!

330
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,439
No! No... no!

331
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,160
Thief!

332
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,000
No!

333
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:02,480
No!

334
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,360
Murderer!

335
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,000
It was an unprecedented
roundup of criminals of every ilk.

336
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,480
It was an unprecedented
roundup of criminals of every ilk.

337
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,400
Your brother
made a public show of it

338
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,000
meting out the summary
judgments himself.

339
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,280
meting out the summary
judgments himself.

340
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,439
I'm told they needed a two-horse cart

341
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,000
to haul away the resulting
dismemberments when it was done.

342
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,560
to haul away the resulting
dismemberments when it was done.

343
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,640
Gods be good.

344
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,000
The Prince cannot be allowed to act
with this kind of unchecked impunity.

345
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,680
The Prince cannot be allowed to act
with this kind of unchecked impunity.

346
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:50,000
- Brother.
- Daemon.

347
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:50,640
- Brother.
- Daemon.

348
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:55,240
Carry on. You were saying
something about my impunity.

349
00:19:57,639 --> 00:20:00,960
You are to explain your doings
with the City Watch.

350
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,600
Your new gold cloaks

351
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,559
made quite the impression
last night, didn't they?

352
00:20:06,639 --> 00:20:07,639
Did they?

353
00:20:07,719 --> 00:20:08,000
The City Watch is not a sword
to be wielded at your whim.

354
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,799
The City Watch is not a sword
to be wielded at your whim.

355
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:12,759
They're an extension of the crown.

356
00:20:12,839 --> 00:20:14,000
The Watch was enforcing
the crown's laws.

357
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:14,720
The Watch was enforcing
the crown's laws.

358
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,480
Wouldn't you agree, Lord Strong?

359
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,919
My Prince, I don't think...

360
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Making a public spectacle
of wanton brutality

361
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,480
Making a public spectacle
of wanton brutality

362
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,279
is hardly in line with our laws.

363
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:24,960
Nobles from every corner of the realm

364
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,000
are right now descending
upon King's Landing

365
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:26,920
are right now descending
upon King's Landing

366
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,319
for my brother's tourney.

367
00:20:28,399 --> 00:20:30,919
Do you want them mugged,
raped, murdered?

368
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
You mightn't know this unless
you left the safety of the Red Keep

369
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,720
You mightn't know this unless
you left the safety of the Red Keep

370
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:36,120
but much of King's Landing
is seen by the smallfolk

371
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,000
as lawless and terrifying.

372
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:38,880
as lawless and terrifying.

373
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,360
Our city should be safe
for all its people.

374
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,199
I agree.

375
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:49,280
I just hope you don't have to maim
half of my city to achieve this.

376
00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:50,000
Time will tell.

377
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,120
Time will tell.

378
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,519
We installed Prince Daemon
as commander

379
00:20:55,599 --> 00:20:56,000
to promote law and order.

380
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,360
to promote law and order.

381
00:20:57,439 --> 00:20:59,799
The criminal element
should fear the City Watch.

382
00:20:59,879 --> 00:21:01,519
Thank you for your support,
Lord Corlys.

383
00:21:01,599 --> 00:21:02,000
If only the Prince would show
the same devotion

384
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,240
If only the Prince would show
the same devotion

385
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:06,200
to his lady wife as he does
his work, Your Grace.

386
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:08,000
You've not been seen in the Vale
or at Runestone for quite some time.

387
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,840
You've not been seen in the Vale
or at Runestone for quite some time.

388
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:12,120
I think my bronze bitch
is happier for my absence.

389
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,839
Lady Rhea is your wife.

390
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:14,000
A good and honorable
lady of the Vale.

391
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,879
A good and honorable
lady of the Vale.

392
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:18,759
In the Vale, men are said
to fuck sheep instead of women.

393
00:21:18,839 --> 00:21:20,000
I can assure you,
the sheep are prettier.

394
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,080
I can assure you,
the sheep are prettier.

395
00:21:21,159 --> 00:21:22,160
Dear me.

396
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,879
You made a vow before the Seven
to honor your wife in marriage.

397
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,000
Well, I'd gladly give Lady Rhea
to you, Lord Hightower

398
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,439
Well, I'd gladly give Lady Rhea
to you, Lord Hightower

399
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,280
if you're in want of a woman
to warm your bed.

400
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,000
Your own lady wife passed recently.

401
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:32,920
Your own lady wife passed recently.

402
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,280
Did she not?

403
00:21:36,719 --> 00:21:37,719
Otto.

404
00:21:40,919 --> 00:21:43,120
Perhaps you aren't ready
to move on just yet.

405
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,799
You know how my brother
makes sport of provoking you.

406
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,759
Must you indulge him?

407
00:21:52,759 --> 00:21:54,519
My apologies, Your Grace.

408
00:21:54,759 --> 00:21:56,000
This council has, at great expense

409
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,520
This council has, at great expense

410
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,240
bettered the City Watch
to your exacting standards.

411
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:02,000
Enforce my laws, but understand

412
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Enforce my laws, but understand

413
00:22:03,439 --> 00:22:07,120
any further performances
like last night's will be answered.

414
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,320
Understood, Your Grace.

415
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,000
King's Landing has been in decline
since my grandmother passed.

416
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,200
King's Landing has been in decline
since my grandmother passed.

417
00:22:28,879 --> 00:22:30,240
In the end

418
00:22:30,879 --> 00:22:32,000
this new City Watch
might be a good thing.

419
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,919
this new City Watch
might be a good thing.

420
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:20,000
What troubles you, my Prince?

421
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:20,680
What troubles you, my Prince?

422
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:28,160
I could bring in another.

423
00:23:28,839 --> 00:23:30,440
Perhaps a maiden.

424
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,000
I have several.

425
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:32,760
I have several.

426
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:37,160
I could even arrange one
with silver hair.

427
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,000
You are Daemon Targaryen.

428
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,520
You are Daemon Targaryen.

429
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:49,120
Rider of Caraxes.
Wielder of Dark Sister.

430
00:23:49,799 --> 00:23:50,000
The King cannot replace you.

431
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,080
The King cannot replace you.

432
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:05,919
Be welcome!

433
00:24:06,759 --> 00:24:08,000
I know many of you
have traveled long leagues

434
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,159
I know many of you
have traveled long leagues

435
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,879
to be at these games

436
00:24:11,319 --> 00:24:14,000
but I promise,
you will not be disappointed.

437
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:14,560
but I promise,
you will not be disappointed.

438
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,759
When I look at the fine knights
in these lists

439
00:24:18,839 --> 00:24:20,000
I see a group without equal
in our histories.

440
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,399
I see a group without equal
in our histories.

441
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:26,000
And this great day
has been made more auspicious

442
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,520
And this great day
has been made more auspicious

443
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:32,000
by the news that I am happy to share.

444
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,400
by the news that I am happy to share.

445
00:24:33,199 --> 00:24:36,120
Queen Aemma has begun her labors!

446
00:24:39,439 --> 00:24:42,919
May the luck of the Seven
shine upon all combatants!

447
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,120
A mystery knight?

448
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,360
No, a Cole, of the Stormlands.

449
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,639
I've never heard of House Cole.

450
00:25:19,719 --> 00:25:20,000
Princess Rhaenys Targaryen!

451
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,359
Princess Rhaenys Targaryen!

452
00:25:22,439 --> 00:25:26,000
I would humbly ask for the favor of
The Queen Who Never Was.

453
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:26,360
I would humbly ask for the favor of
The Queen Who Never Was.

454
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,080
Good fortune to you, cousin.

455
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,599
I would gladly take it
if I thought I needed it.

456
00:25:42,639 --> 00:25:44,000
You could have
Baratheon's tongue for that.

457
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,639
You could have
Baratheon's tongue for that.

458
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,680
Tongues will not change
the succession.

459
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,280
Let them wag.

460
00:25:55,559 --> 00:25:56,000
Lord Stokeworth's daughter

461
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,080
Lord Stokeworth's daughter

462
00:25:57,159 --> 00:25:58,680
is promised
to that young Tarly squire.

463
00:25:58,759 --> 00:26:00,400
Lord Massey's son?

464
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,000
They're to be married
as soon as he wins his knighthood.

465
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:02,840
They're to be married
as soon as he wins his knighthood.

466
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,560
Best get on with it.

467
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:06,799
I heard that Lady Elinor

468
00:26:06,879 --> 00:26:08,000
is hiding a swollen belly
beneath her dress.

469
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,040
is hiding a swollen belly
beneath her dress.

470
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
What do you know about
this Ser Criston Cole, Ser Harrold?

471
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,280
What do you know about
this Ser Criston Cole, Ser Harrold?

472
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:36,759
I'm told Ser Criston is common-born,
son of Lord Dondarrion's steward.

473
00:26:36,839 --> 00:26:38,000
But other than that,
and the fact that he's just unhorsed

474
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,600
But other than that,
and the fact that he's just unhorsed

475
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:43,160
both of the Baratheon lads,
I really couldn't say.

476
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,000
Prince Daemon of House Targaryen!

477
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,279
Prince Daemon of House Targaryen!

478
00:27:04,359 --> 00:27:08,000
Prince of the City will now choose
his first opponent!

479
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,520
Prince of the City will now choose
his first opponent!

480
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:50,000
For his first challenge,
Prince Daemon Targaryen chooses

481
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:50,440
For his first challenge,
Prince Daemon Targaryen chooses

482
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:55,759
Ser Gwayne Hightower of Oldtown,
eldest son of the Hand of the King.

483
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:08,000
Five dragons on Daemon.

484
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,600
Five dragons on Daemon.

485
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:23,520
- Nicely done, Uncle.
- Thank you, Princess.

486
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:26,000
Now, I'm fairly certain
I can win these games, Lady Alicent.

487
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,120
Now, I'm fairly certain
I can win these games, Lady Alicent.

488
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:31,360
Having your favor
would all but assure it.

489
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,520
Good luck, my Prince.

490
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,000
What's happening?

491
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:14,360
What's happening?

492
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,919
The infant is in breech, Your Grace.

493
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,559
All attempts to turn the babe
have failed.

494
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:21,600
Do something for her!

495
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:23,640
We've given her as much
milk of the poppy as we can

496
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,160
without risking the child.

497
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,000
Your Queen is a strong woman.

498
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:26,840
Your Queen is a strong woman.

499
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:30,200
She's fighting with all her might,
but it may not be enough.

500
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,719
No!

501
00:30:31,799 --> 00:30:32,000
Aemma.

502
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,159
Aemma.

503
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,360
Aemma, I'm here.

504
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,759
I'm here.

505
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,759
I'm here. It's all right.

506
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:43,080
- It's all right.
- I don't wanna do this.

507
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,000
You're going to be all right.

508
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:44,920
You're going to be all right.

509
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,399
You're going to be all right.

510
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,720
Kill him!

511
00:31:11,799 --> 00:31:14,000
And the day grows ugly.

512
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:14,160
And the day grows ugly.

513
00:31:17,399 --> 00:31:19,639
I wonder if this is
how we should celebrate

514
00:31:19,719 --> 00:31:20,000
the birth of our future king.

515
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,720
the birth of our future king.

516
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:23,640
With wanton violence.

517
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,919
It's been 70 years
since King Maegor's end.

518
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,679
These knights are as green
as summer grass.

519
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,359
None have known real war.

520
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:32,000
Their lords sent them
to the tourney field

521
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:32,080
Their lords sent them
to the tourney field

522
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:34,919
with fists full of steel
and balls full of seed

523
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,200
and we expect them to act
with honor and grace.

524
00:31:37,599 --> 00:31:38,000
It's a marvel that war
didn't break out at first blood.

525
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,240
It's a marvel that war
didn't break out at first blood.

526
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,159
Mellos.

527
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,560
Your Grace.

528
00:32:06,639 --> 00:32:07,879
If you would.

529
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,120
During a difficult birth

530
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,000
it sometimes becomes necessary
for the father

531
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,279
it sometimes becomes necessary
for the father

532
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,000
to make an impossible choice.

533
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:26,160
to make an impossible choice.

534
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,000
Well, speak it.

535
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:32,000
To sacrifice one
or to lose them both.

536
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,159
To sacrifice one
or to lose them both.

537
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:37,559
There is a chance
that we can save the child.

538
00:32:37,639 --> 00:32:38,000
A technique is taught at the Citadel

539
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,560
A technique is taught at the Citadel

540
00:32:39,639 --> 00:32:41,560
which involves cutting directly
into the womb

541
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,360
to free the infant.

542
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,000
- But the resulting blood loss...
- Seven Hells, Mellos.

543
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,439
- But the resulting blood loss...
- Seven Hells, Mellos.

544
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:00,200
You can save the child?

545
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:02,000
We must either act now
or leave it with the gods.

546
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,240
We must either act now
or leave it with the gods.

547
00:33:15,399 --> 00:33:17,839
Ser Criston Cole will now tilt

548
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:20,000
against Ser Daemon Targaryen,
Prince of the City!

549
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,080
against Ser Daemon Targaryen,
Prince of the City!

550
00:34:30,759 --> 00:34:32,000
- Viserys.
- Yes?

551
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:32,760
- Viserys.
- Yes?

552
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:36,879
They're going to bring
the babe out now.

553
00:34:59,439 --> 00:35:00,679
I love you.

554
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,600
- What is happening?
- No, it's all right.

555
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:13,360
No, what is happening?

556
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,639
- Viserys, what...
- No, it's all right.

557
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:17,640
- What are you doing?
- They're going to bring the babe out.

558
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:18,879
How are they...

559
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,000
- It's all right.
- Viserys, please...

560
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:20,440
- It's all right.
- Viserys, please...

561
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:22,680
- It's all right.
- No, I'm scared.

562
00:35:22,759 --> 00:35:24,160
- Don't be scared.
- What is happening?

563
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,799
Don't be scared.
They're going to bring the babe out.

564
00:35:25,879 --> 00:35:26,000
- Oh no.
- It's all right.

565
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,439
- Oh no.
- It's all right.

566
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,240
They're going to bring the babe out.

567
00:35:31,679 --> 00:35:32,000
No... no!

568
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,040
No... no!

569
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:36,200
I'm making the first incision.

570
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:38,000
No... no!

571
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:38,640
No... no!

572
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:41,520
Viserys, no! Please!

573
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,919
- No... no!
- Don't be scared.

574
00:36:06,679 --> 00:36:08,000
Sword!

575
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:08,080
Sword!

576
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,480
Prince Daemon Targaryen

577
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:13,040
wishes to continue
in a contest of arms!

578
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,000
Yield.

579
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,000
Yield.

580
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:02,480
Yield.

581
00:38:34,879 --> 00:38:37,160
Gods. He's Dornish.

582
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:38,000
I was hoping to ask
for the Princess's favor.

583
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,760
I was hoping to ask
for the Princess's favor.

584
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:53,799
I wish you luck, Ser Criston.

585
00:38:53,879 --> 00:38:55,280
Princess.

586
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:08,000
Congratulations, Your Grace.

587
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:08,120
Congratulations, Your Grace.

588
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,200
You have a son.

589
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,439
It's a boy?

590
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,799
A new heir, Your Grace.

591
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:25,759
Had you and the Queen chosen a name?

592
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:30,360
Baelon.

593
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:46,640
They're waiting for you.

594
00:41:40,439 --> 00:41:41,640
Dracarys.

595
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:20,000
- Where's Rhaenyra?
- Your Grace.

596
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:20,880
- Where's Rhaenyra?
- Your Grace.

597
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:23,759
This is the last thing
any of us wish to discuss

598
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:26,000
at this dark hour,
but I consider the matter urgent.

599
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:26,920
at this dark hour,
but I consider the matter urgent.

600
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,240
What matter?

601
00:42:29,319 --> 00:42:31,240
That of your succession.

602
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:32,000
These recent tragedies

603
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,080
These recent tragedies

604
00:42:33,159 --> 00:42:34,919
have left you
without an obvious heir.

605
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,519
The King has an heir, my Lord Hand.

606
00:42:36,599 --> 00:42:38,000
Despite how difficult this time is,
Your Grace

607
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,159
Despite how difficult this time is,
Your Grace

608
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:42,160
I feel it important
the succession be firmly in place

609
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:43,599
for the stability of the realm.

610
00:42:43,679 --> 00:42:44,000
The succession is already set
by precedent and by law.

611
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,319
The succession is already set
by precedent and by law.

612
00:42:47,399 --> 00:42:49,000
Shall we say his name?

613
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,839
Daemon Targaryen.

614
00:42:52,919 --> 00:42:55,759
If Daemon were to remain
the uncontested heir

615
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:56,000
it could destabilize the realm.

616
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,200
it could destabilize the realm.

617
00:42:58,279 --> 00:43:00,160
The realm? Or this council?

618
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:02,000
No one here can know
what Daemon would do were he king

619
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:02,880
No one here can know
what Daemon would do were he king

620
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:05,640
but no one can doubt his ambition.

621
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:08,000
Look at what he did with
the gold cloaks.

622
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:08,120
Look at what he did with
the gold cloaks.

623
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:10,160
The City Watch
is fiercely loyal to him.

624
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:13,839
- An army 2,000 strong.
- An army you gave him, Otto.

625
00:43:13,919 --> 00:43:14,000
I named Daemon Master of Laws,
but you said he was a tyrant.

626
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,399
I named Daemon Master of Laws,
but you said he was a tyrant.

627
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:18,839
As Master of Coin

628
00:43:18,919 --> 00:43:20,000
you said he was a spendthrift
that would beggar the realm.

629
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,720
you said he was a spendthrift
that would beggar the realm.

630
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:25,480
Putting Daemon in command
of the City Watch was your solution!

631
00:43:25,559 --> 00:43:26,000
A half-measure, Your Grace.

632
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,480
A half-measure, Your Grace.

633
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:30,360
The truth is, Daemon should be
far away from this court.

634
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:32,000
Daemon is my brother.

635
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:32,360
Daemon is my brother.

636
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:33,840
My blood.

637
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:36,519
And he will have his place
at my court.

638
00:43:36,599 --> 00:43:38,000
Let him keep his place
at court, Your Grace

639
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:38,720
Let him keep his place
at court, Your Grace

640
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:42,719
but if the gods should visit
some further tragedy on you

641
00:43:42,799 --> 00:43:44,000
- either by design or accident...
- "Design"?

642
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,720
- either by design or accident...
- "Design"?

643
00:43:46,279 --> 00:43:47,640
What are you saying?

644
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:50,000
My brother would murder me,
take my crown?

645
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:50,120
My brother would murder me,
take my crown?

646
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:52,799
Are you?

647
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:55,639
Please.

648
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:59,680
Daemon has ambition, yes,
but not for the throne.

649
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:01,599
He lacks the patience for it.

650
00:44:01,719 --> 00:44:02,000
The gods have yet to make a man

651
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,360
The gods have yet to make a man

652
00:44:03,439 --> 00:44:06,759
who lacks the patience
for absolute power, Your Grace.

653
00:44:06,839 --> 00:44:08,000
Under such circumstances,
it would not be an aberration

654
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,560
Under such circumstances,
it would not be an aberration

655
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:12,919
for the King to name a successor.

656
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Well, who else would have a claim?

657
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:14,840
Well, who else would have a claim?

658
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:23,240
The King's firstborn child.

659
00:44:23,319 --> 00:44:25,719
Rhaenyra? A girl?

660
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:29,000
No queen has ever
sat the Iron Throne.

661
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:31,040
That is only by tradition
and precedent, Lord Strong.

662
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:32,000
If order and stability
so concerns this council

663
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,280
If order and stability
so concerns this council

664
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:35,279
then perhaps we shouldn't
break 100 years of it

665
00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:37,040
by naming a girl heir.

666
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:38,000
Daemon would be
a second Maegor, or worse.

667
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,640
Daemon would be
a second Maegor, or worse.

668
00:44:40,759 --> 00:44:43,280
He is impulsive and violent.

669
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:44,000
It is the duty of this council

670
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,159
It is the duty of this council

671
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:48,120
to protect the King
and the realm from him.

672
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:50,000
I'm sorry, Your Grace,
but that is the truth as I see it

673
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,879
I'm sorry, Your Grace,
but that is the truth as I see it

674
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:53,319
and I know that others here agree.

675
00:44:53,399 --> 00:44:56,000
I will not be made to choose
between my brother and my daughter.

676
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,199
I will not be made to choose
between my brother and my daughter.

677
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:59,000
You wouldn't have to, Your Grace.

678
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:01,400
There are others
who would have a claim.

679
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:02,000
Such as your wife, Lord Corlys?

680
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,040
Such as your wife, Lord Corlys?

681
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:05,359
- The Queen Who Never Was?
- Rhaenys was the only child

682
00:45:05,439 --> 00:45:06,559
of Jaehaerys' eldest son.

683
00:45:06,639 --> 00:45:08,000
She had a strong claim
at the Great Council

684
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:08,560
She had a strong claim
at the Great Council

685
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:09,840
and she already has a male heir.

686
00:45:09,919 --> 00:45:13,080
Just moments ago, you announced
your support for Daemon!

687
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:14,000
If we cannot agree on an heir,
then how can we expect...

688
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:14,640
If we cannot agree on an heir,
then how can we expect...

689
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,759
My wife and son are dead!

690
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:20,000
I will not sit here and suffer crows
that come to feast on their corpses!

691
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,439
I will not sit here and suffer crows
that come to feast on their corpses!

692
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:56,000
Send a raven to Oldtown.
Straight away.

693
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,160
Send a raven to Oldtown.
Straight away.

694
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:02,000
My Lady.

695
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:02,480
My Lady.

696
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:13,839
My darling.

697
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:24,200
How's Rhaenyra?

698
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:28,439
She lost her mother.

699
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:31,960
The Queen was well-loved by all.

700
00:46:34,279 --> 00:46:37,120
I found myself thinking
of your own mother today.

701
00:46:43,679 --> 00:46:44,000
- How is His Grace?
- Very low.

702
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
- How is His Grace?
- Very low.

703
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:49,320
Which is why I sent for you.

704
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:56,000
I thought you might go to him,
offer him comfort.

705
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,520
I thought you might go to him,
offer him comfort.

706
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:02,000
In his chambers?

707
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:02,240
In his chambers?

708
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:10,480
I wouldn't know what to say.

709
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:12,639
Stop that.

710
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
He'll be glad of a visitor.

711
00:47:23,919 --> 00:47:26,000
You might wear
one of your mother's dresses.

712
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:26,320
You might wear
one of your mother's dresses.

713
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:02,000
The Lady Alicent Hightower,
Your Grace.

714
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
The Lady Alicent Hightower,
Your Grace.

715
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:11,399
What is it, Alicent?

716
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:13,679
I thought I might come
and look in on you, Your Grace.

717
00:48:15,439 --> 00:48:16,759
I brought a book.

718
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:20,000
That's very kind, thank you.

719
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:20,960
That's very kind, thank you.

720
00:48:25,799 --> 00:48:26,000
It's a favorite of mine.

721
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,159
It's a favorite of mine.

722
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,280
I do know how passionate you are
for the histories.

723
00:48:31,719 --> 00:48:32,000
Yes, I am.

724
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,720
Yes, I am.

725
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:51,919
When my mother died

726
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:55,839
people only ever
spoke to me in riddles.

727
00:48:57,639 --> 00:48:59,600
All I wanted was for someone
to say that they were sorry

728
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:01,320
for what happened to me.

729
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:07,000
I'm very sorry, Your Grace.

730
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:54,080
Thank you.

731
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,319
The King's sole heir once again.

732
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:02,000
Might we drink to our future?

733
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,120
Might we drink to our future?

734
00:50:04,319 --> 00:50:05,759
Quiet!

735
00:50:05,839 --> 00:50:08,000
Your Prince will speak!

736
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:08,760
Your Prince will speak!

737
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:13,799
Silence!

738
00:50:18,919 --> 00:50:20,000
Before we begin, Your Grace

739
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:20,920
Before we begin, Your Grace

740
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:25,160
I have a report
I feel compelled to share.

741
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:28,000
Last night

742
00:50:28,839 --> 00:50:31,480
Prince Daemon bought out
one of the pleasure houses

743
00:50:31,559 --> 00:50:32,000
on the Street of Silk

744
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,199
on the Street of Silk

745
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,080
to entertain officers
of the City Watch

746
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:38,000
and other friends of his.

747
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:38,960
and other friends of his.

748
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:44,000
King and Council
have long rued my position

749
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:44,400
King and Council
have long rued my position

750
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:46,640
as next in line for the throne.

751
00:50:47,759 --> 00:50:50,000
But dream and pray as they all might,
it seems I'm not so easily replaced.

752
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,200
But dream and pray as they all might,
it seems I'm not so easily replaced.

753
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:56,000
The gods give
just as the gods take away.

754
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,919
The gods give
just as the gods take away.

755
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,879
He toasted Prince Baelon.

756
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:01,440
To the King's son.

757
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:03,800
Styling him...

758
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:07,160
the Heir for a Day.

759
00:51:13,679 --> 00:51:14,000
I corroborated this report
with three separate witnesses.

760
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,600
I corroborated this report
with three separate witnesses.

761
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:20,000
The evening was,
by all accounts, a celebration.

762
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,879
The evening was,
by all accounts, a celebration.

763
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:26,000
You cut the image
of the conqueror, brother.

764
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:26,640
You cut the image
of the conqueror, brother.

765
00:51:27,879 --> 00:51:29,160
Did you say it?

766
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:32,000
I don't know what you mean.

767
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:32,800
I don't know what you mean.

768
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:34,319
You will address me as "Your Grace"

769
00:51:34,399 --> 00:51:37,320
or I will have my Kingsguard
cut out your tongue.

770
00:51:40,759 --> 00:51:44,000
"The Heir for a Day."
Did you say it?

771
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,199
"The Heir for a Day."
Did you say it?

772
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:56,000
We must all mourn
in our own way, Your Grace.

773
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,040
We must all mourn
in our own way, Your Grace.

774
00:51:58,319 --> 00:52:01,519
My family has just been destroyed.

775
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:05,480
But instead of being
by my side, or Rhaenyra's

776
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:08,000
you chose to celebrate your own rise!

777
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:08,240
you chose to celebrate your own rise!

778
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:11,399
Laughing with your whores
and your lickspittles!

779
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:14,000
You have no allies at court but me!

780
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,439
You have no allies at court but me!

781
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:19,120
I have only ever defended you!

782
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:20,000
Yet everything I've given you,
you've thrown back in my face.

783
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,560
Yet everything I've given you,
you've thrown back in my face.

784
00:52:21,639 --> 00:52:23,560
You've only ever
tried to send me away.

785
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:26,000
To the Vale, to the City Watch,
anywhere but by your side.

786
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,040
To the Vale, to the City Watch,
anywhere but by your side.

787
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:30,040
Ten years you've been king

788
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:32,000
and yet not once have you
asked me to be your Hand!

789
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,120
and yet not once have you
asked me to be your Hand!

790
00:52:33,199 --> 00:52:36,160
- Why would I do that?
- Because I'm your brother.

791
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:38,000
And the blood of the dragon
runs thick.

792
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,000
And the blood of the dragon
runs thick.

793
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:41,160
Then why do you cut me so deeply?

794
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:44,000
I've only ever spoken the truth.
I see Otto Hightower for what he is.

795
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,000
I've only ever spoken the truth.
I see Otto Hightower for what he is.

796
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:47,919
- An unwavering and loyal Hand?
- A cunt.

797
00:52:48,919 --> 00:52:50,000
A second son
who stands to inherit nothing

798
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:50,920
A second son
who stands to inherit nothing

799
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,240
he doesn't seize for himself.

800
00:52:52,319 --> 00:52:54,480
Otto Hightower
is a more honorable man

801
00:52:54,559 --> 00:52:56,000
- than you could ever be.
- He doesn't protect you.

802
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:56,520
- than you could ever be.
- He doesn't protect you.

803
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:58,359
- I would.
- From what?

804
00:52:58,439 --> 00:52:59,839
Yourself.

805
00:53:03,159 --> 00:53:05,720
You're weak, Viserys.

806
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:09,760
And that council of leeches knows it.

807
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:12,120
They all prey on you
for their own ends.

808
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:18,679
I have decided to name a new heir.

809
00:53:18,759 --> 00:53:20,000
- I'm your heir.
- Not anymore.

810
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,280
- I'm your heir.
- Not anymore.

811
00:53:22,399 --> 00:53:25,839
You are to return to Runestone
and your lady wife at once

812
00:53:25,919 --> 00:53:26,000
and you are to do so without quarrel
by order of your King.

813
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:30,919
and you are to do so without quarrel
by order of your King.

814
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:46,960
Your Grace.

815
00:54:43,719 --> 00:54:44,000
Father.

816
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:44,920
Father.

817
00:54:48,919 --> 00:54:50,000
Balerion was the last living creature

818
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:50,680
Balerion was the last living creature

819
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:53,279
to have seen Old Valyria
before the Doom.

820
00:54:55,879 --> 00:54:56,000
Its greatness and its flaws.

821
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,840
Its greatness and its flaws.

822
00:54:58,359 --> 00:55:00,559
When you look at the dragons,
what do you see?

823
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:02,000
What?

824
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:02,160
What?

825
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:05,000
You haven't spoken a word to me
since Mother's funeral

826
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:06,519
and now you send
your Kingsguard down...

827
00:55:06,599 --> 00:55:08,000
Answer me.

828
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:08,120
Answer me.

829
00:55:10,439 --> 00:55:11,839
It's important.

830
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:13,759
What do you see?

831
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:23,879
- I suppose I see us.
- Tell me.

832
00:55:24,759 --> 00:55:26,000
Everyone says Targaryens
are closer to gods than to men

833
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,520
Everyone says Targaryens
are closer to gods than to men

834
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:31,200
but they say that
because of our dragons.

835
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:35,040
Without them,
we're just like everyone else.

836
00:55:37,559 --> 00:55:38,000
The idea that we control
the dragons is an illusion.

837
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:42,719
The idea that we control
the dragons is an illusion.

838
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:47,520
They're a power
man should never have trifled with.

839
00:55:48,919 --> 00:55:50,000
One that brought Valyria its doom.

840
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,000
One that brought Valyria its doom.

841
00:55:51,639 --> 00:55:54,519
If we don't mind our own histories,
it will do the same to us.

842
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:56,000
Targaryen must understand this
to be King...

843
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,840
Targaryen must understand this
to be King...

844
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:00,280
or Queen.

845
00:56:04,359 --> 00:56:06,120
I'm sorry, Rhaenyra.

846
00:56:06,879 --> 00:56:08,000
I have wasted the years
since you were born

847
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,679
I have wasted the years
since you were born

848
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:11,359
wanting for a son.

849
00:56:22,839 --> 00:56:24,759
You are the very best of your mother.

850
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:29,960
And I believe it, I know she did

851
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:32,000
that you could be
a great ruling queen.

852
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:32,400
that you could be
a great ruling queen.

853
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:34,040
Daemon is your heir.

854
00:56:35,399 --> 00:56:37,919
Daemon was not made
to wear the crown.

855
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:40,000
But I believe that you were.

856
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:43,839
Corlys of House Velaryon

857
00:56:43,919 --> 00:56:44,000
Lord of the Tides
and Master of Driftmark.

858
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,879
Lord of the Tides
and Master of Driftmark.

859
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:50,000
I, Corlys Velaryon

860
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,040
I, Corlys Velaryon

861
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:54,080
Lord of the Tides
and Master of Driftmark

862
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:56,000
promise to be faithful
to King Viserys

863
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:56,080
promise to be faithful
to King Viserys

864
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:59,040
and his named heir,
the Princess Rhaenyra.

865
00:56:59,120 --> 00:57:01,080
I pledge fealty to them

866
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:02,000
and shall defend them
against all enemies

867
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,280
and shall defend them
against all enemies

868
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:05,680
in good faith and without deceit.

869
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:12,960
I swear this by the old gods
and the new.

870
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:18,000
This is no trivial gesture, Rhaenyra.

871
00:57:18,080 --> 00:57:20,000
A dragon's saddle is one thing

872
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:20,080
A dragon's saddle is one thing

873
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:23,200
but the Iron Throne is the most
dangerous seat in the realm.

874
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:25,919
I, Lord Hobert Hightower

875
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,240
Beacon of the South,
Defender of the Citadel

876
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:29,759
and Voice of Oldtown

877
00:57:29,839 --> 00:57:32,000
promise to be faithful
to King Viserys

878
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:32,440
promise to be faithful
to King Viserys

879
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:35,520
and his named heir,
the Princess Rhaenyra.

880
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:39,720
I pledge fealty to them

881
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:41,680
and shall defend them
against all enemies

882
00:57:41,759 --> 00:57:44,000
in good faith and without deceit.

883
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:44,360
in good faith and without deceit.

884
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:47,919
I swear this by the old gods
and the new.

885
00:57:54,639 --> 00:57:56,000
Give me your hand.

886
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:56,040
Give me your hand.

887
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,960
I, Boremund Baratheon

888
00:58:12,919 --> 00:58:14,000
promise to be faithful
to King Viserys.

889
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,319
promise to be faithful
to King Viserys.

890
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:20,000
There's something else
that I need to tell you.

891
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,600
There's something else
that I need to tell you.

892
00:58:21,679 --> 00:58:23,640
It might be difficult
for you to understand

893
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:25,440
but you must hear it.

894
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:27,760
Our histories

895
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:30,759
they tell us that Aegon looked across
the Blackwater from Dragonstone

896
00:58:30,839 --> 00:58:32,000
saw a rich land ripe for the capture.

897
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,320
saw a rich land ripe for the capture.

898
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:37,599
But ambition alone is not
what drove him to conquest.

899
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:39,879
It was a dream.

900
00:58:40,439 --> 00:58:42,599
And just as Daenys foresaw
the end of Valyria

901
00:58:42,679 --> 00:58:44,000
Aegon foresaw
the end of the world of men.

902
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,360
Aegon foresaw
the end of the world of men.

903
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:50,000
'Tis to begin with a terrible winter
gusting out of the distant north.

904
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:50,920
'Tis to begin with a terrible winter
gusting out of the distant north.

905
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:54,200
I, Rickon Stark,
Lord of Winterfell...

906
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:56,000
Aegon saw absolute darkness
riding on those winds.

907
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,560
Aegon saw absolute darkness
riding on those winds.

908
00:58:57,639 --> 00:59:01,240
And whatever dwells within
will destroy the world of the living.

909
00:59:01,679 --> 00:59:02,000
When this Great Winter comes,
Rhaenyra

910
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,799
When this Great Winter comes,
Rhaenyra

911
00:59:04,879 --> 00:59:07,320
all of Westeros
must stand against it.

912
00:59:07,599 --> 00:59:08,000
And if the world of men
is to survive

913
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:08,880
And if the world of men
is to survive

914
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:11,520
a Targaryen must be seated
on the Iron Throne.

915
00:59:11,839 --> 00:59:13,480
A king or queen

916
00:59:13,559 --> 00:59:14,000
strong enough to unite the realm
against the cold and the dark.

917
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:17,200
strong enough to unite the realm
against the cold and the dark.

918
00:59:19,519 --> 00:59:20,000
Aegon called his dream
"The Song of Ice and Fire."

919
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,359
Aegon called his dream
"The Song of Ice and Fire."

920
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:26,000
This secret

921
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:26,160
This secret

922
00:59:27,159 --> 00:59:29,879
it's been passed from king to heir
since Aegon's time.

923
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:32,000
Now you must promise to carry it

924
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,679
Now you must promise to carry it

925
00:59:34,319 --> 00:59:35,759
and protect it.

926
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:40,240
Promise me this, Rhaenyra.

927
00:59:44,560 --> 00:59:45,879
Promise me.

928
00:59:51,439 --> 00:59:56,000
I, Viserys Targaryen,
first of his name

929
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:56,640
I, Viserys Targaryen,
first of his name

930
00:59:58,120 --> 01:00:01,719
King of the Andals, and the Rhoynar,
and the First Men

931
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:06,480
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms,
and Protector of the Realm

932
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:08,000
do hereby name

933
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:08,880
do hereby name

934
01:00:09,639 --> 01:00:11,600
Rhaenyra Targaryen

935
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:13,879
Princess of Dragonstone

936
01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:14,000
and heir to the Iron Throne.

937
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,399
and heir to the Iron Throne.
