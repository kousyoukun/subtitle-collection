1
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:10,430
坦格利安王朝第一世纪终了时刻
As the first century of the Targaryen dynasty came to a close

2
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:14,760
老国王杰赫里斯的健康情况日趋恶化
the health of the Old King, Jaehaerys, was failing.

3
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:21,670
当时坦格利安家族势力正处于颠峰
In those days, House Targaryen stood at the height of its strength

4
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,670
其麾下有十只成龙
with ten adult dragons under its yoke.

5
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:28,200
举世所向披靡
No power in the world could stand against it.

6
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:33,390
杰赫里斯国王统治了 将近６０年的和平与繁荣
King Jaehaerys reigned over nearly 60 years of peace and prosperity

7
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,630
但他两个儿子纷纷双亡
but tragedy had claimed both his sons

8
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:38,520
让他的继承之位悬空
leaving his succession in doubt.

9
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:41,830
于是在１０１年
So, in the year 101

10
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:45,560
老国王召开了大议会选出一位继承人
the Old King called a Great Council to choose an heir.

11
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:50,240
千余名领主前往赫伦堡
Over a thousand lords made the journey to Harrenhal.

12
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:57,190
听说有１４人有资格继承 但真正纳入考虑的只有两位
Fourteen succession claims were heard but only two were truly considered.

13
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,040
雷妮丝坦格利安公主 国王后代中最年长的女儿
Princess Rhaenys Targaryen, the King's eldest descendant

14
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,750
以及她的堂弟韦赛里斯坦格利安王子
and her younger cousin, Prince Viserys Targaryen

15
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:08,280
国王后代中最年长的儿子
the King's eldest male descendant.

16
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:18,040
根据七大王国的
It is declared by all lords paramount

17
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:22,600
所有君主与附庸决议
and lords vassal of the Seven Kingdoms

18
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:29,520
韦赛里斯坦格利安王子为龙石岛王子
that Prince Viserys Targaryen be made Prince of Dragonstone!

19
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,080
而身为女子的雷妮丝 不能继承铁王座之位
Rhaenys, a woman, would not inherit the Iron Throne.

20
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:40,000
领主们反而选择了韦赛里斯
The lords instead chose Viserys

21
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,670
也就是我的父亲
my father.

22
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:48,000
杰赫里斯召开大议会
Jaehaerys called the Great Council

23
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:51,120
防止争夺继任之争
to prevent a war being fought over his succession.

24
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,750
因为他知道一个残酷的现实
For he knew the cold truth.

25
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:59,600
唯一足以毁灭龙族的 即出自于龙族自身
The only thing that could tear down the House of the Dragon was itself.

26
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:15,000
本WEB版外挂字幕由  风吹来的那片云  双语合并
第一季第一集

27
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:22,480
（坦格利安王朝 韦赛里斯一世统治的第九年）

28
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:26,640
（疯王伊里斯死前）

29
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:31,440
（以及他女儿 丹妮莉丝坦格利安出生前１７２年）

30
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:11,430
欢迎回家 公主 相信你这趟旅途很愉快
Welcome back, Princess. I trust your ride was pleasant.

31
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,960
别这么一派轻松的样子 爵士
Try not to look too relieved, ser.

32
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:14,640
我是很轻松
I am relieved.

33
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,830
每次那黄金猛兽 把你安然无恙地带回来
Every time that golden beast brings you back unspoiled

34
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,280
就省了我不少麻烦
it saves my head from a spike.

35
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:24,590
叙拉克斯长得很快 她很快就跟科拉克休一样大
Syrax is growing quickly. She'll soon be as large as Caraxes.

36
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:26,600
大到都能放上双人鞍座了
That's almost large enough to saddle two.

37
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,270
我相信我看看就满足了 谢谢
I believe I'm quite content as a spectator, thank you.

38
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,320
雷妮拉
Rhaenyra.

39
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:07,440
你知道我目前这情况下 不喜欢你乘龙飞行
You know I don't like you to go flying while I'm in this condition.

40
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:10,000
你任何情况下都不喜欢我乘龙飞行
 You don't like me to go flying while you're in any condition.

41
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:14,320
－陛下 －早 阿莉森
- Your Grace. - Good morrow, Alicent.

42
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,960
－你有睡吗  －有
Did you sleep? - I slept.

43
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,040
睡了多久 
- How long?

44
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,280
我不需要被呵护 雷妮拉
I don't need mothering, Rhaenyra.

45
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:25,750
但你周遭的人尽是为了宝宝呵护备至
Well, here you are, surrounded by attendants all focused on the babe.

46
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:27,390
总得有人照顾你
Someone has to attend to you.

47
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:33,120
你很快也会躺在这张床上 雷妮拉
You will lie in this bed soon enough, Rhaenyra.

48
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:36,480
这种不舒适就是我们贡献王国的方式
This discomfort is how we serve the realm.

49
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:39,870
我宁愿当骑士 以战争的荣耀来贡献王国
I'd rather serve as a knight and ride to battle and glory.

50
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:44,680
你跟我都有皇家的孕育之身
We have royal wombs, you and I.

51
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,480
分娩就是我们的战场
The childbed is our battlefield.

52
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,430
我们必须坚毅地咬牙面对
We must learn to face it with a stiff lip.

53
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:57,960
去洗澡 你跟龙一样臭
Now take a bath. You stink of dragon.

54
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:03,760
于是我跟他说“你看错边了”
So, I said to him, "Well, I believe you might be looking up the wrong end."

55
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,920
阁下
My lords.

56
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,080
自由贸易城邦之间的联盟日益茁壮 宣称自己为三女儿王国
The growing alliance among the Free Cities has taken to styling itself the Triarchy.

57
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:15,800
他们聚集在血石岛
They have massed on Bloodstone

58
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:19,080
目前避开石阶列岛的海盗滋扰
and are presently ridding the Stepstones of its pirate infestation.

59
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,720
感觉应该是好消息 科利斯大人
Well, that sounds suspiciously like good news, Lord Corlys.

60
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:24,120
一位叫克拉贾斯卓哈尔的人
A man called Craghas Drahar

61
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,720
自称是这三女儿王国的王子上将
has styled himself the prince-admiral of this Triarchy.

62
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:29,200
他们叫他喂蟹人
They call him the Crabfeeder

63
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,960
基于他惩罚敌人所发明的手段
due to his inventive methods of punishing his enemies.

64
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,160
意思是我们要为海盗哀悼吗 
And are we meant to weep for dead pirates?

65
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,160
－不 陛下… －雷妮拉 你迟到了
- No, Your Grace. - Rhaenyra, you're late.

66
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:41,640
国王的斟酒人不能迟到 让大家等酒喝
The King's cupbearer must not be late. - Leaves people wanting for cups.

67
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,040
我去看母亲
- I was visiting Mother.

68
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,520
骑龙去的 
On dragonback?

69
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:52,160
陛下 根据戴蒙王子的建议 国王已经投入大量资金
Hey, Your Grace, at Prince Daemon's urging the crown has invested significant capital

70
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:55,480
维持并重整他的都城守备
in the re-training and re-equipping of his City Watch.

71
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:59,640
我认为您该建议弟弟出席会议
I thought you might urge your brother to fill his seat on the council

72
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:04,430
并让他进而成为守备司令
and provide an assessment of his progress as commander of the Watch.

73
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,960
你觉得戴蒙因目前的任务而心有旁骛
Do you think Daemon is distracted by his present tasks?

74
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,190
他的思绪与精力已无暇他事 
And that his thoughts and energies are occupied?

75
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:12,440
就相关成本来说 当然希望如此
Well, one would hope so, considering the associated costs.

76
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:15,480
就当做你的黄金是良好的投资 毕斯柏里大人
Then let us all consider your gold well-invested, Lord Beesbury.

77
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,750
我建议你别放任三女儿王国
I would urge that you not allow this Triarchy much latitude

78
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:20,000
在石阶列岛有如此的自由 陛下
in the Stepstones, Your Grace.

79
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:23,640
要是那些航线失败 就会拖累我们的港口
If those shipping lanes should fall, it will beggar our ports.

80
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:26,360
科利斯大人 国王已经听到你的建言了
The crown has heard your report, Lord Corlys

81
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,240
并且在慎重考虑
and takes it under advisement.

82
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:36,400
陛下 那我们该讨论 继承人的比武大赛一事吗 
Shall we discuss the Heir's Tournament, Your Grace?

83
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,920
非常乐意
I would be delighted.

84
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,640
梅罗斯 学士预期的诞生日可靠吗 
Will the maesters' name day prediction hold, Mellos?

85
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:45,080
国王陛下 您必须了解 这些事情都只是预估而已
You must understand that these things are mere estimations, my King

86
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:48,710
但我们焚膏继晷
but we have all been poring over the moon charts

87
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:52,120
觉得我们的预估已经尽量精准
and we feel that our forecast is as accurate as it can be.

88
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,960
比武大赛的花费不赀
The cost of the tournament is not negligible.

89
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:59,270
也许我们该延迟到 我们确切知道孩子出生之时
Perhaps we might delay until the child is in hand?

90
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:02,040
大多的领主与骑士都正在 前往君临的路上
Most of the lords and knights are certainly on their way to King's Landing already.

91
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,160
－让他们回去会… －大赛为期将近一周
- To turn them back now... - The tourney will take the better part of a week.

92
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:08,000
在大赛结束前 我的儿子就出生了
Before the games are over, my son will be born

93
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,560
之后便是举国欢腾
and the whole realm will celebrate.

94
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:12,550
我们无法预知孩子的性别
We have no way of predicting the sex of the child.

95
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:13,670
当然
Of course,

96
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:16,870
没有学士能够在 无凭据的情况下提供任何想法吧 
no maester's capable of rendering an opinion free of conditions, are they now?

97
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,520
王后怀的是男孩 我知道
There's a boy in the Queen's belly. I know it.

98
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:27,000
我的继承人很快就不需要 担忧这些事了
And my heir will soon put all of this damnable hand-wringing to rest himself.

99
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,200
天一亮他就会穿过红堡之门
He passed through the Red Keep's gates at first light.

100
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,840
我父亲知道他来了吗 
Does my father know he's here?

101
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:35,600
－不知道 －很好
- No. - Good.

102
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,800
诸神慈悲
Gods be good.

103
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:46,600
没关系 爵士
It's all right, ser.

104
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,360
你在干么 叔叔

105
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:01,790
好好坐着 有一天这会是我的椅子

106
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:04,120
除非你想以叛国论处

107
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:07,750
你很久没进宫廷了

108
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:09,190
是的
Aye.

109
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,960
宫廷十分无聊

110
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:14,880
那为何还要回来

111
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,670
我听说你爸爸以我的名义举办大赛

112
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:20,760
大赛是为了他的继承人而办

113
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:24,240
如我说的一样

114
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,120
他的新继承人

115
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:31,630
除非你母亲生下儿子

116
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,630
否则你们都甩不掉我

117
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,000
那么我希望有个弟弟

118
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,280
我带了个东西给你
I bought you something.

119
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,000
你知道是什么吗 
Do you know what it is?

120
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,710
是瓦雷利亚钢
It's Valyrian steel.

121
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,390
像是暗黑姐妹
Like Dark Sister.

122
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,480
转过来
Turn around.

123
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:11,910
现在…
Now

124
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,870
你跟我俩都拥有祖先的一小部分
you and I both own a small piece of our ancestry.

125
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:25,790
好美

126
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,480
－你看了吗  －我当然看了
- Did you read it? - Of course, I read it.

127
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:33,040
娜梅莉亚公主抵达多恩时嫁给了谁 
When Princess Nymeria arrived in Dorne who did she take to husband?

128
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:35,520
－一个男人 －他叫什么名字 
A man. What was his name?

129
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,080
某个大人
Lord Something.

130
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,160
如果你回答“某个大人” 马洛主教会大发雷霆
If you answer with "Lord Something," Septa Marlow will be furious.

131
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,710
她生气时很好笑
She's funny when she's furious.

132
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,910
你担心的时候就是这个样子
You're always like this when you're worried.

133
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:49,830
哪样子 
Like what?

134
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,150
很难相处
Disagreeable.

135
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,200
你担心你父亲有了儿子 就会让你相形见拙
You're worried your father is about to overshadow you with a son.

136
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:00,480
我只担心我母亲
I only worry for my mother.

137
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:03,600
我希望我父亲能够喜获麟子
I hope for my father that he gets a son.

138
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:07,160
就我所知 这是他梦寐以求的
As long as I can recall, it's all he's wanted.

139
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,430
你希望他有儿子 
You want him to have a son?

140
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,960
我想跟你乘龙飞行
I want to fly with you on dragonback

141
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,840
看遍狭海的奇观 只顾吃着蛋糕
see the great wonders across the Narrow Sea and eat only cake.

142
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,910
－我是认真的 －我从不拿蛋糕开玩笑
- I'm being serious. - I never jest about cake.

143
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:19,440
你不担心你的地位 
You aren't worried about your position?

144
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:21,760
我喜欢这个位子 非常舒适
I like this position. It's quite comfortable.

145
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:29,080
－你要去哪里  －回家 天色已晚
Where are you going? Home. The hour has grown late.

146
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:34,120
娜梅莉亚公主带领她的洛伊拿人 乘坐万艘船舰穿越狭海
Princess Nymeria led her Rhoynar across the Narrow Sea on 10,000 ships

147
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,160
逃离瓦雷利亚人的追杀
to flee their Valyrian pursuers.

148
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,080
她嫁给了多恩的莫尔斯马尔泰
She took Lord Mors Martell of Dorne to husband

149
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:41,160
在阳戟城烧毁了她的船舰
and burned her own fleet off Sunspear

150
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:43,630
让她的人民知道他们不再逃亡了
to show her people that they were finished running.

151
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,960
－你在干么  －这样你就记住了
- What are you doing? - So you remember.

152
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,720
－要是主教看见这本书 那… －别管主教了
- If the Septa sees this book then... - Fuck the Septa.

153
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,560
雷妮拉
Rhaenyra!

154
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,280
愈合了吗 
Is it healing?

155
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,720
长得很慢 陛下
It has grown slightly, Your Grace.

156
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,630
你知道是什么吗 
Can you say yet what it is?

157
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,390
已经向学城提出询问
We've sent inquiries to the Citadel.

158
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,520
他们正在寻找相似案例的文献
They are searching the texts for similar cases.

159
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,800
只不过是王座造成的小擦伤 没什么大不了
It's a small cut from sitting the throne. It's nothing.

160
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:25,440
准备孩子出生 国王压力很大
The King has been under heavy stresses preparing for the birth.

161
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:30,040
心情不好会影响身体
Bad humors of the mind can adversely affect the body.

162
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:33,720
不论是什么 都不要声张
Whatever it is, it needs to be kept quiet.

163
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,720
我们该再用水蛭放血一次
We should leech it again, maester.

164
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:41,270
大学士 这是个不愿愈合的伤口
It's a wound that refuses to heal, Grand Maester.

165
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:44,320
我可以建议用烧灼的吗 
Might I suggest cauterization?

166
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:47,910
陛下 烧灼不失为一个 明智的治疗方法
Cauterization would be a wise course of treatment, Your Grace.

167
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,870
－会很痛… －好吧
- It will be painful... - Fine.

168
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:52,790
好吧
Fine.

169
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,590
你在浴缸的时间 比我坐在王座的时间还久
You spend more time in that bath than I do on the throne.

170
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:11,750
这些日子以来 这是我唯一觉得舒服的地方
This is the only place I can find comfort these days.

171
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,280
很温
It's tepid.

172
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:18,120
这是学士们能够允许的温度内
It's as warm as the maesters will allow.

173
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,000
他们不知道龙喜欢热吗 
Don't they know dragons prefer heat?

174
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,720
经过这次如此折腾的怀孕
After this miserable pregnancy

175
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:27,720
如果我真的生出一只龙 我也不意外
I wouldn't be surprised if I hatched an actual dragon.

176
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:30,240
他会受到钟爱与珍惜
And he will be loved and cherished.

177
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:34,000
雷妮拉已经说她想要个妹妹
Rhaenyra has already declared that she is to have a sister.

178
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,430
真的 
Really?

179
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,830
她甚至名字都帮她取好了
- She even named her.

180
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,440
我可以问吗 
- Dare I ask?

181
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:40,160
维桑尼亚
Visenya.

182
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:44,240
她选了一颗恐龙蛋 因为那让她想起瓦格哈尔号的摇篮
She chose a dragon's egg for the cradle that she said reminded her of Vhagar.

183
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,840
诸神慈悲
Gods be good.

184
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:47,830
这家族已经有维桑尼亚了
This family already has its Visenya.

185
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,600
你亲爱的弟弟有捎来任何消息吗 
Has there been any word from your dear brother?

186
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,120
在我任命他为都城守备司令后 就再也没消息
Not since I named him Commander of the City Watch.

187
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,270
我相信他会因大赛而再次出现
I'm sure he will reemerge for the tourney.

188
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,000
他无法抗拒
He could never stay away from the lists.

189
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:02,840
大赛 
The tourney

190
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:05,960
庆祝你目前还没出生的第一位长子 
to celebrate the firstborn son that we presently do not have.

191
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,760
你确实明白
You do understand

192
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,550
如果宝宝本身没有小鸡鸡 怎么样都不会长出来吧
nothing will cause the babe to grow a cock if it does not already possess one?

193
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,480
艾玛 这孩子是个男孩
This child is a boy, Aemma.

194
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,720
－是啊 －我很确定
I'm certain of it.

195
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:19,590
我从没如此确定过
I've never been more certain of anything.

196
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:27,430
这个梦…比记忆还清晰
The dream. It was clearer than a memory.

197
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,480
我们的儿子是戴着伊耿铁冠出世的
Our son was born wearing Aegon's iron crown.

198
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:37,710
当我听到雷霆
When I heard the sound of thundering hooves

199
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:40,200
护盾与剑鸣之声
splintering shields, and ringing swords

200
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,670
我把我们的儿子放在铁王座
and I placed our son upon the Iron Throne

201
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:49,240
敲响总主教之钟 众龙齐鸣
as the bells of the Grand Sept tolled and all the dragons roared as one.

202
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,320
戴冠而生
Born wearing a crown?

203
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:59,080
愿诸神饶过我吧 生产本身就已经够不舒服了
Gods spare me, birth is unpleasant enough as it is.

204
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:11,200
韦赛里斯 这是最后一次了吗 
This is the last time, Viserys.

205
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:16,600
我一个宝宝襁褓中死亡 两个死胎
I've lost one babe in the cradle, had two stillbirths

206
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,440
两次流产
and two pregnancies ended well before their term.

207
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,960
算来五次了 数量已经是孕期的两倍
That's five in twice as many years.

208
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:29,310
我知道让你有位继承人是我的职责
I know it is my duty to provide you an heir

209
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:32,880
如果我让你失望 我很抱歉 真的很抱歉
and I'm sorry if I have failed you in that.

210
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,120
不
I am.

211
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:38,920
但我已经尽力 为我所有死去的孩子哀悼
But I've mourned all the dead children I can.

212
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:01,160
司令驾到
Commander on the floor!

213
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:11,200
我接下守备司令一职时 你们都还是流浪的野种
When I took command of the Watch, you were stray mongrels

214
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:15,040
挨饿 毫无纪律
starving and undisciplined.

215
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:23,000
现在你们是一群猎犬 酒足饭饱 严阵以待准备狩猎
Now, you're a pack of hounds. You're sated and honed for the hunt.

216
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,200
我兄长的都城变得肮脏贫穷
My brother's city has fallen into squalor.

217
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:33,720
各种犯罪丛生
Crime of every breed has been allowed to thrive.

218
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,630
不能再如此下去
No longer.

219
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:41,240
今晚开始 君临将学会畏惧金色
Beginning tonight King's Landing will learn to fear the color gold.

220
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:26,920
起来
Get up!

221
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:42,590
不要…不

222
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,120
强暴犯
Raper!

223
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:52,200
不…
No! No... no!

224
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:00,710
小偷
Thief!

225
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,600
不
No!

226
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,430
杀人犯
Murderer!

227
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,350
一场针对每个罪犯前所未有的围捕
It was an unprecedented roundup of criminals of every ilk.

228
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:33,190
你弟弟公开作秀 自行草率判决
Your brother made a public show of it meting out the summary judgments himself.

229
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,560
据说他们需要双驾马车
I'm told they needed a two-horse cart

230
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,240
在结束的时候拖走最后的支解尸块
to haul away the resulting dismemberments when it was done.

231
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:41,270
诸神慈悲
Gods be good.

232
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:46,240
王子不能因为免责 就如此为所欲为
The Prince cannot be allowed to act with this kind of unchecked impunity.

233
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:50,480
－兄长 －戴蒙
- Brother. - Daemon.

234
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:54,830
继续 你刚说到我的免责权
Carry on. You were saying something about my impunity.

235
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:01,000
你要解释你率领都城守备队 的所作所为
You are to explain your doings with the City Watch.

236
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,480
你昨晚新的金披风 让人印象深刻 不是吗 
Your new gold cloaks made quite the impression last night, didn't they?

237
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:07,550
是吗 
Did they?

238
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:10,720
都城守备队不是 任你肆意使用的一把剑
The City Watch is not a sword to be wielded at your whim.

239
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:12,590
他们是君权的延伸
They're an extension of the crown.

240
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:16,430
守备队等于是在执行王法 你不同意吗 斯壮大人 
The Watch was enforcing the crown's laws. Wouldn't you agree, Lord Strong?

241
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:20,360
－王子陛下 我不觉得… －做一场公开而肆无忌惮的
My Prince, I don't think... Making a public spectacle of wanton brutality

242
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,270
暴行大秀与我们的法律背道而驰
is hardly in line with our laws.

243
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:25,590
现在境内贵族从四面八方
Nobles from every corner of the realm

244
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:28,350
来君临参与我兄长的大赛
are right now descending upon King's Landing for my brother's tourney.

245
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,590
你要他们被抢 被强暴 被杀 
Do you want them mugged, raped, murdered?

246
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:33,480
除非维安交给红堡 你也许不知道此事
You mightn't know this unless you left the safety of the Red Keep

247
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:38,640
但君临的多数平民都认为 此地无法无天 十分可怕
but much of King's Landing is seen by the smallfolk as lawless and terrifying.

248
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,080
我们的都城该让所有人感到安全无虞
Our city should be safe for all its people.

249
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:44,960
我同意
I agree.

250
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:49,400
我只是不希望你为此重创我的都城
I just hope you don't have to maim half of my city to achieve this.

251
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:50,800
时间会证明一切
Time will tell.

252
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:56,960
我们任命戴蒙王子为司令 是为了促进法律与秩序
We installed Prince Daemon as commander to promote law and order.

253
00:20:57,670 --> 00:20:59,600
犯罪分子该惧怕都城守备队
The criminal element should fear the City Watch.

254
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:01,360
感谢你的支持 科利斯大人
Thank you for your support, Lord Corlys.

255
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:04,160
要是王子对他妻子
If only the Prince would show the same devotion

256
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:06,040
能够像他工作这么热情就好了 陛下
to his lady wife as he does his work, Your Grace.

257
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:09,630
你很久没去谷地与符石城
You've not been seen in the Vale or at Runestone for quite some time.

258
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,790
我不在 我那古铜婊子开心多了
I think my bronze bitch is happier for my absence.

259
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:15,800
雷娅夫人是你的妻子 谷地善良又品德高尚的一名女士
Lady Rhea is your wife. A good and honorable lady of the Vale.

260
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:18,590
谷地 据说男人都上羊而不是女人
In the Vale, men are said to fuck sheep instead of women.

261
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:21,150
我向你保证 羊美多了
I can assure you, the sheep are prettier.

262
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,240
天啊
Dear me.

263
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:25,080
你在七王面前发誓说 婚后你会尊敬你的妻子
You made a vow before the Seven to honor your wife in marriage.

264
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,390
海塔尔大人 我非常乐意 把雷娅夫人送给你

You could have Baratheon's tongue for that.

－用力 －快替她想办法

A technique is taught at the Citadel

363
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:43,510
直接切入子宫拿出婴儿
which involves cutting directly into the womb to free the infant.

364
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:46,200
－但失血的后果… －天啊 梅罗斯
- But the resulting blood loss... - Seven Hells, Mellos.

365
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,430
你能救活孩子 
You can save the child?

366
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:04,040
我们得立刻进行 或者就交由诸神来决定了
We must either act now or leave it with the gods.

00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:54,670
公主
Princess.

397
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,710
恭喜 陛下
Congratulations, Your Grace.

398
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,240
您有儿子了
You have a son.

399
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:17,480
－是男孩  －新继承人 陛下
It's a boy? A new heir, Your Grace.

400
00:39:23,310 --> 00:39:25,480
您跟王后选好名字了吗 
Had you and the Queen chosen a name?

401
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:30,080
贝隆尔
Baelon.

402
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,200
他们在等你
They're waiting for you.

403
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,520
不知道我弟活着的那几小时

404
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,520
我父亲是否终于开心了

405
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:04,080
你父亲在此时此刻

406
00:41:05,750 --> 00:41:08,720
更需要你

407
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:11,160
我不可能成为儿子

408
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:20,440
雷妮拉人呢 
- Where's Rhaenyra?

409
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:24,960
陛下 在此黑暗的时刻 我们万分不情愿讨论此事
- Your Grace. This is the last thing any of us wish to discuss at this dark hour,

410
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:27,910
－但事关紧要 －什么事 
but I consider the matter urgent. What matter?

411
00:42:29,350 --> 00:42:30,750
您的继承人
That of your succession.

412
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:34,830
近来的不幸让您没有明确的继承人
These recent tragedies have left you without an obvious heir.

413
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,440
国王有继承人 首相大人
The King has an heir, my Lord Hand.

414
00:42:36,550 --> 00:42:39,040
尽管目前万分艰难 陛下
Despite how difficult this time is, Your Grace

415
00:42:39,150 --> 00:42:41,000
我觉得为了王国的稳定
I feel it important the succession be firmly in place

416
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:43,550
选定继承人万分重要
for the stability of the realm.

417
00:42:43,670 --> 00:42:47,310
就惯例以及法律 继承已经安排好了
The succession is already set by precedent and by law.

418
00:42:47,430 --> 00:42:48,670
该说出他的名字吗 
Shall we say his name?

419
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:52,480
戴蒙坦格利安
Daemon Targaryen.

420
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:55,670
如果要维持戴蒙无异议的继承顺位
If Daemon were to remain the uncontested heir

421
00:42:55,790 --> 00:42:58,200
可能会动摇国本
it could destabilize the realm.

422
00:42:58,310 --> 00:43:00,120
国本 还是本会议 
The realm? Or this council?

423
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:02,920
这里没人知道戴蒙为王后会做什么
No one here can know what Daemon would do were he king

424
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,430
但没人怀疑过他的野心
but no one can doubt his ambition.

425
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:08,040
看他拿金披风干的好事
Look at what he did with the gold cloaks.

426
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:11,600
都城守备队对他万分忠诚 一个两千人的强大军队
The City Watch is fiercely loyal to him.

427
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,360
是你给他的军队 奥托
- An army 2,000 strong. - An army you gave him, Otto.

428
00:43:13,910 --> 00:43:17,080
我任命戴蒙为法律学士 但你说他是暴君
I named Daemon Master of Laws, but you said he was a tyrant.

429
00:43:17,790 --> 00:43:21,670
当财政大臣 你说他会败光国家财产
As Master of Coin you said he was a spendthrift that would beggar the realm.

430
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:25,360
让戴蒙掌管都城守备队 是你的解决之道
Putting Daemon in command of the City Watch was your solution!

431
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:27,430
折衷的办法 陛下
A half-measure, Your Grace.

432
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:30,320
事实是 戴蒙该远离这个宫廷
The truth is, Daemon should be far away from this court.

433
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:33,600
戴蒙是我弟弟 我的血亲
Daemon is my brother. My blood.

434
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:36,550
他在我的宫廷会有一席之地
And he will have his place at my court.

435
00:43:36,630 --> 00:43:38,520
就让他在宫廷占有一席之位 陛下
Let him keep his place at court, Your Grace

436
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:42,550
但要是诸神让您再度面临不幸
but if the gods should visit some further tragedy on you

437
00:43:42,670 --> 00:43:45,760
－不论是蓄意或是意外… －蓄意 
- either by design or accident... - "Design"?

438
00:43:46,350 --> 00:43:47,560
你什么意思 
What are you saying?

439
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:49,960
我弟会杀了我 夺我之位 
My brother would murder me, take my crown?

440
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:52,680
是吗 
Are you?

441
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:55,550
拜托
Please.

442
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:59,350
戴蒙有野心 是的 但不会觊觎王位
Daemon has ambition, yes, but not for the throne.

443
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:01,550
他没有那份耐心
He lacks the patience for it.

444
00:44:01,670 --> 00:44:04,600
诸神从未让一个没有耐心的人
The gods have yet to make a man

445
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:06,590
握有绝对的权力 陛下
who lacks the patience for absolute power, Your Grace.

446
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:08,680
在这种情形下
Under such circumstances,

447
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:13,080
国王任命继承人就不会是违反常态
it would not be an aberration for the King to name a successor.

448
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:14,880
还有谁有资格 
Well, who else would have a claim?

449
00:44:21,430 --> 00:44:23,270
国王第一位出生的后代
The King's firstborn child.

450
00:44:23,390 --> 00:44:25,480
雷妮拉 一个女人 
Rhaenyra? A girl?

451
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:29,040
铁王座上没坐过任何女王
No queen has ever sat the Iron Throne.

452
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:31,200
那只是根据传统与惯例 斯壮大人
That is only by tradition and precedent, Lord Strong.

453
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:33,240
如果御前会议如此担心秩序与稳定
If order and stability so concerns this council

454
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:37,000
那么我们也许不该任命女子 为继承人 打破百年传统
then perhaps we shouldn't break 100 years of it by naming a girl heir.

455
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:40,200
戴蒙会成为第二个梅葛 甚至更糟
Daemon would be a second Maegor, or worse.

456
00:44:40,870 --> 00:44:42,790
他既冲动又暴力
He is impulsive and violent.

457
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:48,000
让他别接近国王与王国 是御前会议的职责
It is the duty of this council to protect the King and the realm from him.

458
00:44:49,510 --> 00:44:51,760
抱歉 陛下 但这是我所见到的事实
I'm sorry, Your Grace, but that is the truth as I see it

459
00:44:51,870 --> 00:44:53,560
我知道这里其他人也会同意
and I know that others here agree.

460
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:57,240
我不能在我弟跟我女儿之间做选择
I will not be made to choose between my brother and my daughter.

461
00:44:57,360 --> 00:45:01,510
不需要 陛下 还有其他人选
You wouldn't have to, Your Grace. There are others who would have a claim.

462
00:45:01,670 --> 00:45:04,160
比如说你的妻子 科利斯大人  无冕女王
Such as your wife, Lord Corlys?

463
00:45:04,270 --> 00:45:06,590
雷妮丝是杰赫里斯长子的唯一孩子
- The Queen Who Never Was? - Rhaenys was the only child of Jaehaerys' eldest son.

464
00:45:06,710 --> 00:45:08,480
大议会也曾经强烈考虑过她
She had a strong claim at the Great Council

465
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:11,270
－而且她已经有了男性后代 －刚才
and she already has a male heir. Just moments ago,

466
00:45:11,390 --> 00:45:13,040
你还说你支持戴蒙
you announced your support for Daemon!

467
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:17,080
－若我们在继承上没有共识 如何… －我妻儿都死了
If we cannot agree on an heir, then how can we expect... My wife and son are dead!

468
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:22,830
我不会坐在这里忍受 乌鸦到他们尸体上饱食一顿
I will not sit here and suffer crows that come to feast on their corpses!

469
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:58,160
立刻派渡鸦到旧镇
Send a raven to Oldtown. Straight away.

470
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:02,160
夫人
My Lady.

471
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:13,510
亲爱的
My darling.

472
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:23,750
雷妮拉还好吗 
How's Rhaenyra?

473
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:27,800
她失去母亲
She lost her mother.

474
00:46:29,830 --> 00:46:31,910
王后一直都受众人爱戴
The Queen was well-loved by all.

475
00:46:34,270 --> 00:46:37,080
我今天想起你母亲
I found myself thinking of your own mother today.

476
00:46:43,710 --> 00:46:45,960
－陛下如何  －非常低落
- How is His Grace? - Very low.

477
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:49,400
所以我才派你去
Which is why I sent for you.

478
00:46:54,510 --> 00:46:58,310
我想你该去找他 安慰他
I thought you might go to him, offer him comfort.

479
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,160
到他房间去 
In his chambers?

480
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:10,120
我不知道要说什么
I wouldn't know what to say.

481
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:12,120
别这么想
Stop that.

482
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:15,630
有访客他就很开心了
He'll be glad of a visitor.

483
00:47:23,870 --> 00:47:25,960
你可以穿你母亲的衣服
You might wear one of your mother's dresses.

484
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:03,560
阿莉森海塔尔夫人 陛下
The Lady Alicent Hightower, Your Grace.

485
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:10,560
什么事 阿莉森 
What is it, Alicent?

486
00:48:11,350 --> 00:48:13,160
我想我该来看看您 陛下
I thought I might come and look in on you, Your Grace.

487
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:16,350
我带了本书来
I brought a book.

488
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:20,600
你很贴心 谢谢
That's very kind, thank you.

489
00:48:25,790 --> 00:48:27,000
这是我最喜欢的一本书
It's a favorite of mine.

490
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:30,120
我知道您非常热爱历史
I do know how passionate you are for the histories.

491
00:48:31,750 --> 00:48:33,670
是的 没错
Yes, I am.

492
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:51,630
我母亲死时
When my mother died

493
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:55,320
大家都尽说我听不懂的话
people only ever spoke to me in riddles.

494
00:48:57,600 --> 00:49:00,870
我其实只希望有人对我说 他们很遗憾我的遭遇
All I wanted was for someone to say that they were sorry for what happened to me.

495
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:06,590
我很遗憾 陛下
I'm very sorry, Your Grace.

496
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:54,040
谢谢你
Thank you.

497
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:58,310
再度成为国王的唯一继承人
The King's sole heir once again.

498
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:02,880
来敬我们的未来吧 
Might we drink to our future?

499
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:08,120
安静 王子有话要说
Quiet! Your Prince will speak!

500
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:13,510
安静
Silence!

501
00:50:16,830 --> 00:50:18,870
－王子 －说句话吧

502
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,560
我们开始前 陛下
Before we begin, Your Grace

503
00:50:21,670 --> 00:50:24,830
我有个消息要先说
I have a report I feel compelled to share.

504
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:27,960
昨晚
Last night

505
00:50:28,790 --> 00:50:32,960
戴蒙王子买断了丝街一家寻欢处
Prince Daemon bought out one of the pleasure houses on the Street of Silk

506
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:38,560
来招待他都城守备队的将官 以及其他的友人
to entertain officers of the City Watch and other friends of his.

507
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:46,520
国王与御前会议长久以来 不满我是下一位王位继承人
King and Council have long rued my position as next in line for the throne.

508
00:50:47,750 --> 00:50:52,960
但尽管他们做春秋大梦与祷告 似乎我没那么容易被取代
But dream and pray as they all might, it seems I'm not so easily replaced.

509
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:57,960
诸神给予的 随时都能拿走
The gods give just as the gods take away.

510
00:50:58,080 --> 00:51:01,040
－他敬贝隆尔王子… －敬国王的儿子
He toasted Prince Baelon. To the King's son.

511
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:03,430
说他是
Styling him...

512
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:06,870
一日继承人
the Heir for a Day.

513
00:51:13,630 --> 00:51:17,430
我找了三个不同的目击者 才确认这个消息
I corroborated this report with three separate witnesses.

514
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:21,520
就各方面说来 昨晚就是庆祝盛会
The evening was, by all accounts, a celebration.

515
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:26,200
你很有征服者的架式 兄长
You cut the image of the conqueror, brother.

516
00:51:27,910 --> 00:51:29,160
你说了吗 
Did you say it?

517
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:34,040
－我不懂你的意思 －你该称我“陛下”
I don't know what you mean. You will address me as "Your Grace"

518
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:37,400
不然我就叫御林铁卫割下你的舌头
or I will have my Kingsguard cut out your tongue.

519
00:51:40,790 --> 00:51:44,720
“一日继承人” 你这么说的吗 
"The Heir for a Day." Did you say it?

520
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:56,920
我们都用自己的方式哀悼 陛下
We must all mourn in our own way, Your Grace.

521
00:51:58,350 --> 00:52:01,550
我才刚失去家人
My family has just been destroyed.

522
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:05,080
与其不陪在我身边 或是雷妮拉身边
But instead of being by my side, or Rhaenyra's

523
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:07,830
你选择庆祝自己攀升位阶
you chose to celebrate your own rise!

524
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:11,120
跟你的那群妓女跟奉承者寻欢作乐
Laughing with your whores and your lickspittles!

525
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:15,720
你在宫廷里只有我这个盟友
You have no allies at court but me!

526
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:18,480
我一直在替你说话
I have only ever defended you!

527
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:21,600
我给你的一切 都被你都这样糟蹋了
Yet everything I've given you, you've thrown back in my face.

528
00:52:21,670 --> 00:52:23,480
你只想把我送走
You've only ever tried to send me away.

529
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:28,080
到谷地 到都城守备队 任何不在你身边的地方
To the Vale, to the City Watch, anywhere but by your side.

530
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:31,280
你当了十年的国王 但从没
Ten years you've been king

531
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:33,150
要我当你的首相
and yet not once have you asked me to be your Hand!

532
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:35,960
－我为何要这么做  －因为我是你弟弟
- Why would I do that? - Because I'm your brother.

533
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:41,080
－龙之血浓于水 －那你为何还要伤我这么深 
And the blood of the dragon runs thick. Then why do you cut me so deeply?

534
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:44,160
我只说实话而已 我看到奥托海塔尔的真面目
I've only ever spoken the truth. I see Otto Hightower for what he is.

535
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:47,310
－坚毅忠贞的首相  －一个婊子
- An unwavering and loyal Hand? - A cunt.

536
00:52:48,870 --> 00:52:52,270
一个不努力争取就没得继承的次子
A second son who stands to inherit nothing he doesn't seize for himself.

537
00:52:52,390 --> 00:52:55,510
奥托海塔尔比你更值得尊敬
Otto Hightower is a more honorable man than you could ever be.

538
00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:58,390
－他没有保护你 我有 －保护什么 
- He doesn't protect you. - I would. - From what?

539
00:52:58,520 --> 00:52:59,520
远离你自己
Yourself.

540
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:05,870
你很懦弱 韦赛里斯
You're weak, Viserys.

541
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:11,600
御前会议的水蛭都知道这件事 并虎视眈眈
And that council of leeches knows it. They all prey on you for their own ends.

542
00:53:16,430 --> 00:53:18,440
我决定任命新继承人
I have decided to name a new heir.

543
00:53:18,550 --> 00:53:20,760
－我是你的继承人 －不再是了
- I'm your heir. - Not anymore.

544
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:25,910
你立刻回到符石城以及你夫人身边
You are to return to Runestone and your lady wife at once

545
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,120
好好遵命 不准反驳
and you are to do so without quarrel

546
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:30,960
是你的国王下的命令
by order of your King.

547
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:46,240
陛下
Your Grace.

548
00:54:43,790 --> 00:54:44,920
父亲
Father.

549
00:54:48,910 --> 00:54:53,160
贝勒里恩是见过末日浩劫前 旧瓦雷利亚唯一仅存的龙
Balerion was the last living creature to have seen Old Valyria before the Doom.

550
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:57,870
其伟大与瑕疵
Its greatness and its flaws.

551
00:54:58,430 --> 00:55:00,360
但你看着龙时 你看到了什么 
When you look at the dragons, what do you see?

552
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:04,960
什么 自从母亲丧礼后 你完全没跟我说过一句话
What? You haven't spoken a word to me since Mother's funeral

553
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:07,510
－现在你派御林铁卫… －回答我
and now you send your Kingsguard down... Answer me.

554
00:55:10,430 --> 00:55:11,560
这很重要
It's important.

555
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:13,550
你看到什么 
What do you see?

556
00:55:21,190 --> 00:55:23,600
－我应该是看到我们吧 －告诉我
- I suppose I see us. - Tell me.

557
00:55:24,830 --> 00:55:28,120
大家都说坦格利安家族 比较接近诸神而非人类
Everyone says Targaryens are closer to gods than to men

558
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:31,000
但他们这么说 都是因为我们的龙
but they say that because of our dragons.

559
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:34,600
没有了龙 我们就跟其他人一样
Without them, we're just like everyone else.

560
00:55:37,510 --> 00:55:42,510
我们能够控制龙的这个观念 只是个假象
The idea that we control the dragons is an illusion.

561
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:47,240
它们是人们绝对不能轻忽的力量
They're a power man should never have trifled with.

562
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:50,680
让瓦雷利亚走向末日的力量
One that brought Valyria its doom.

563
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:54,160
如果我们不以自己的历史为借镜 就会同样步入这种命运
If we don't mind our own histories, it will do the same to us.

564
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:57,670
坦格利安家的人 必须了解这一点才能当国王
Targaryen must understand this to be King...

565
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:00,120
或是女王
or Queen.

566
00:56:04,390 --> 00:56:05,560
抱歉 雷妮拉
I'm sorry, Rhaenyra.

567
00:56:06,830 --> 00:56:10,910
打从你出生后 我浪费这么多年一直想要个儿子
I have wasted the years since you were born wanting for a son.

568
00:56:22,750 --> 00:56:24,750
你遗传你母亲最棒的优点
You are the very best of your mother.

569
00:56:27,670 --> 00:56:32,160
我相信 我知道她也认同 你将会是个伟大的女王
And I believe it, I know she did that you could be a great ruling queen.

570
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:33,910
戴蒙才是你的继承人
Daemon is your heir.

571
00:56:35,430 --> 00:56:38,040
戴蒙不适合称王
Daemon was not made to wear the crown.

572
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:40,040
但我相信你适合
But I believe that you were.

573
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:43,870
瓦列利安家族的科利斯
Corlys of House Velaryon

574
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,910
潮城君主暨潮头岛之主
Lord of the Tides and Master of Driftmark.

575
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:50,400
在下科利斯瓦列利安
I, Corlys Velaryon

576
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:53,430
潮城君主暨潮头岛之主
Lord of the Tides and Master of Driftmark

577
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:58,960
发誓效忠韦赛里斯国王 以及他任命的继承人 雷妮拉公主
promise to be faithful to King Viserys and his named heir, the Princess Rhaenyra.

578
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:00,360
我保证对他们效忠…
I pledge fealty to them

579
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:05,750
为他们抵御所有敌人 真心诚意 绝不欺瞒
and shall defend them against all enemies in good faith and without deceit.

580
00:57:09,870 --> 00:57:12,550
我对新旧诸神发誓
I swear this by the old gods and the new.

581
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:17,480
这不是儿戏 雷妮拉
This is no trivial gesture, Rhaenyra.

582
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:19,710
龙鞍是一回事
A dragon's saddle is one thing

583
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:23,200
但铁王座是王国中最危险的座位
but the Iron Throne is the most dangerous seat in the realm.

584
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:25,910
在下霍柏特海塔尔
I, Lord Hobert Hightower

585
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,200
南方烽烟 学城的护卫
Beacon of the South, Defender of the Citadel

586
00:57:28,310 --> 00:57:29,790
旧镇之声
and Voice of Oldtown

587
00:57:29,870 --> 00:57:35,160
发誓效忠韦赛里亚国王 以及他任命的继承人雷妮拉公主
promise to be faithful to King Viserys and his named heir, the Princess Rhaenyra.

588
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:41,080
我保证对他们效忠 防御所有敌人…
I pledge fealty to them and shall defend them against all enemies

589
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:44,080
－科拉克休 －真心诚意 绝不欺瞒
in good faith and without deceit.

590
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:47,390
我对新旧诸神发誓
I swear this by the old gods and the new.

591
00:57:54,790 --> 00:57:56,000
手给我
Give me your hand.

592
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:14,040
在下博蒙德拜拉席恩发誓效忠…
I, Boremund Baratheon promise to be faithful to King Viserys.

593
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:20,720
还有件事我要告诉你
There's something else that I need to tell you.

594
00:58:21,670 --> 00:58:24,870
也许你很难理解 但你必须听好
It might be difficult for you to understand but you must hear it.

595
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:27,360
我们的历史
Our histories

596
00:58:27,910 --> 00:58:30,790
据说伊耿从龙石岛望向黑水河
they tell us that Aegon looked across the Blackwater from Dragonstone

597
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:33,240
看见了一片可得的肥沃之地
saw a rich land ripe for the capture.

598
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:37,280
但驱使他征服的不仅仅是野心
But ambition alone is not what drove him to conquest.

599
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:39,670
而是一个梦
It was a dream.

600
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:42,670
就像是丹妮丝预见瓦雷利亚的末日
And just as Daenys foresaw the end of Valyria

601
00:58:42,790 --> 00:58:45,120
伊耿预见了人类世界的末日
Aegon foresaw the end of the world of men.

602
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:50,680
这一切将从遥远的北方开始 一场严冬寒风来袭
'Tis to begin with a terrible winter gusting out of the distant north.

603
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:54,280
在下瑞肯史塔克 临冬城君主暨北境守护…
I, Rickon Stark, Lord of Winterfell...

604
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:57,520
伊耿看见那阵风带来无比黑暗
Aegon saw absolute darkness riding on those winds.

605
00:58:57,630 --> 00:59:01,000
潜伏其中者将毁灭万物的世界
And whatever dwells within will destroy the world of the living.

606
00:59:01,830 --> 00:59:03,670
当这场凛冬来袭 雷妮拉
When this Great Winter comes, Rhaenyra

607
00:59:04,910 --> 00:59:06,750
维斯特洛全体都将起而对抗
all of Westeros must stand against it.

608
00:59:07,550 --> 00:59:10,120
人类世界要存活 坦格利安家族之人就必须
And if the world of men is to survive

609
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:11,350
坐上铁王座之位
a Targaryen must be seated on the Iron Throne.

610
00:59:11,870 --> 00:59:13,510
不论是国王或是女王
A king or queen

611
00:59:13,590 --> 00:59:17,160
都要强大到足以 团结整个王国对抗寒冷与黑暗
strong enough to unite the realm against the cold and the dark.

612
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:22,200
伊耿称他这个梦为“冰与火之歌”
Aegon called his dream "The Song of Ice and Fire."

613
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:29,680
这个秘密从伊耿时代 国王就一代代传给继承人
This secret it's been passed from king to heir since Aegon's time.

614
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:35,160
现在你必须保证传承并守护这个秘密
Now you must promise to carry it and protect it.

615
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:39,840
答应我 雷妮拉
Promise me this, Rhaenyra.

616
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:45,520
答应我
Promise me.

617
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:56,440
我 韦赛里斯坦格利安一世…
I, Viserys Targaryen, first of his name

618
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:01,630
安达尔人 洛伊拿人以及先民的国王
King of the Andals, and the Rhoynar, and the First Men

619
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:06,320
七大王国之主 国家的保护者
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, and Protector of the Realm

620
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:13,200
在此任命雷妮拉坦格利安 龙石岛公主
do hereby name Rhaenyra Targaryen Princess of Dragonstone

621
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,640
以及铁王座的继承人
and heir to the Iron Throne.

622
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:46,790
待续

623
01:00:46,870 --> 01:00:47,870
谢谢观赏
