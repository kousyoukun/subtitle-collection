Chapter 10: "The Black Queen"

3
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,000
- drift mark -

4
00:02:22,679 --> 00:02:23,719
.there you are

5
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,839
?The sea snake is going to die, isn't it?

6
00:02:39,279 --> 00:02:40,799
Luke...
- I can't be the tide lord

7
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,399
.Grandpa was the greatest sailor who ever lived

8
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:47,559
I get seasick even before
the ship leaves the port

9
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,600
I will destroy everything

10
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,280
.I don't want drift mark

11
00:02:53,559 --> 00:02:55,040
Sir Raymond should
have got the place

12
00:02:55,159 --> 00:02:57,839
We don't choose our
fate, Luke. It chooses us

13
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,440
Grandpa let you choose
if you will be his heir

14
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:02,960
.that's what you told us

15
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,480
?You want to know the truth

16
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,200
.I was afraid

17
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:20,359
I was 14, like you now

18
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:24,960
I was not ready to be the
queen of the seven kingdoms

19
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,280
But it was my duty

20
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:33,399
And over time I realized that
I had to earn my inheritance

21
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,440
I'm not like you

22
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,359
?In what respect, sweet boy

23
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,799
...I'm not like that

24
00:03:41,839 --> 00:03:42,640
.perfect

25
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,879
I am far from perfect

26
00:03:55,679 --> 00:03:58,960
My father took care of me and
helped prepare me to fulfill my duties

27
00:03:59,559 --> 00:04:01,760
.your mother will do the same for you

28
00:04:03,359 --> 00:04:04,519
.Good morning princess

29
00:04:04,839 --> 00:04:05,879
.Good morning, Sir Laurent

30
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,720
Princess Hyaenas arrived
on the back of a dragon

31
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,720
She urgently requests a meeting
with you and Prince Damon

32
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:33,480
Princess Hyaenas Targaryen.
Thank you, Sir Laurent-

33
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:42,040
Princess Hyaenas, have you brought
news of Lord Coriolisâ€™s recovery?

34
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,199
.Servery is dead

35
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,560
I mourn your loss
with you, Rhaenyra 

36
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,440
...to my cousin

37
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,000
Your father had a good heart

38
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,960
.that's not all

39
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,200
.Argon was crowned as his successor

40
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,360
?They crowned him

41
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,000
?How did Revisers die?

42
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,799
I don't know

43
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:29,879
?When

44
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,040
.a day, maybe two days ago

45
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,720
I was locked in my room while
the queen was getting ready

46
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:34,960
Revisers was murdered

47
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:41,240
Ali cent demanded that you
swear allegiance to Argon

48
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,280
.indeed

49
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,360
I refused her.  - But you're alive

50
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:54,920
The High Seton crowned
Argon in the Dragon Pit

51
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,440
I saw it with my own eyes
before I ran away from Mails

52
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,280
They crowned him in front of the crowd

53
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,520
.so that the crowd will see him as the rightful king

54
00:06:03,599 --> 00:06:06,800
The harlot queen murdered my
brother and usurped his throne

55
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,400
.and you could burn them all for it

56
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,080
War must be declared because
of this betrayal, without a doubt

57
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,520
But I don't need
to start this war

58
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:23,080
I hastened to warn you, only out of
loyalty to my husband and my family

59
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:29,719
The greens are on their way to
you, Rhaenyra , and to your children

60
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,400
.You must leave Dragons tone immediately

61
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,360
The baby is about to be born

62
00:07:02,119 --> 00:07:05,240
Her pregnancy is not over.
This is not supposed to happen

63
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:07,719
!It's happening, dammit

64
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,960
.Don't lose your temper, princess.  come on

65
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:14,880
.you've done it five times already

66
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:17,479
Keep calm and the sixth
time will be no different

67
00:07:17,559 --> 00:07:19,920
Leave me alone!  they left me

68
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,679
I want tours around the island

69
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:30,160
Let them look for small
boats that can anchor

70
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:35,240
If the Greens attack now, it
will be by stealth, not directly

71
00:07:35,479 --> 00:07:37,400
We don't have enough
people to surround the island

72
00:07:37,479 --> 00:07:39,800
But we can create the impression
that we are stronger than them

73
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,199
, recruit the dragon guards.
They are good fighters

74
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,519
Don't waste time

75
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:47,840
.it will be done, prince

76
00:07:59,359 --> 00:08:02,719
.what was that?  -I'm sorry

77
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:06,720
Don't be so hard on him, prince

78
00:08:07,239 --> 00:08:09,280
So that he learns what
you are trying to teach

79
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,439
Your mother needs to see you

80
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,719
.the two of you

81
00:08:16,719 --> 00:08:17,599
?mother

82
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,679
.damn it

83
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,520
.the princess

84
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,840
.Your grandfather King Naysayers is dead

85
00:08:39,079 --> 00:08:40,000
Revisers?

86
00:08:40,319 --> 00:08:44,760
The Greens denied the will and
claimed the Iron Throne for themselves

87
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,559
.Argon was crowned king

88
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,080
What should be done
about it? Nothing for now-

89
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,800
Where's Damon?

90
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,760
I don't know, he's out of his mind

91
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,159
.went out to plan his war

92
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,280
Leave Damon to me

93
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:05,800
... Jace

94
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,640
.Jaycees

95
00:09:13,199 --> 00:09:16,240
Whatever claim to the throne
I have left, you are its heir now

96
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,360
Nothing should be done without my command

97
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,519
A crow arrived this morning

98
00:09:35,599 --> 00:09:38,480
The sea serpent recovered
from his illness and he left Ivan pol

99
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,679
Where is he sailing?

100
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,359
Not clear, Prince

101
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,920
We will send crows
to our closest allies

102
00:09:44,079 --> 00:09:48,040
.Lords Drawling, Massey and Bar A mm on

103
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,080
Damon!

104
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:52,040
Do you want to talk?
With the scholar, the prince

105
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:03,239
I will fly to Riverrun myself
and secure Lord Tully's support

106
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,439
.you won't

107
00:10:07,719 --> 00:10:10,000
My mother ordered not to take
any action while she was in bed

108
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,920
.good to have you here, young prince

109
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,960
We need you to patrol
the skies on Irma

110
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,000
?Did you hear what I said?

111
00:10:27,559 --> 00:10:28,840
.The Ravens, Lord Barbarous

112
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,079
.I'll take care of it

113
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,320
.Call Sir Step hon

114
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:35,319
Kings guard. Should
be in Dragoon

115
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:39,520
Come with me, I'll show
you what real loyalty is

116
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,160
You swore to be knights
in the King's Guard

117
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,719
Like anyone who wears
a white cloak, prince

118
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:54,440
?whom

119
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:59,080
I swore for the first time,
to King Jay air is, a prince

120
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:02,920
and then to his majesty the king
Valparaiso when he succeeded him

121
00:11:03,119 --> 00:11:05,000
Do you know the correct
order of succession?

122
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,600
.Yes.  - Yes, the prince

123
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:18,240
Do you remember who he appointed? King
Budweiser appointed a successor before his death

124
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:22,880
.Princess Rainier

125
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,359
I thank you for your
long service to the crown

126
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,280
.and therefore I will let you choose

127
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,519
Re-swear allegiance to
Rhaenyra as your queen

128
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,480
.to Prince Jailbreak as heir to the Iron Throne

129
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,679
...or

130
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:11,439
If you support the
crown prince, say so now

131
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,800
.and die a quick and dignified death

132
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,559
But if you choose betrayal

133
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,679
If you swear allegiance
now, and betray later

134
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:28,439
Know that you will die.  screaming

135
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,800
Princess, let us help you

136
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,760
Get out of here!

137
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,920
.the princess, please

138
00:12:45,239 --> 00:12:47,040
Get out of here!
- You shouldn't be doing this alone, princess

139
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,240
.let us help you

140
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,400
Farewell, brothers

141
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:34,639
I swear to protect the
queen with all my might

142
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,440
and pour out my blood for her

143
00:16:43,719 --> 00:16:45,239
I will not marry a woman

144
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,600
I will not own the lands

145
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,199
And I won't have children

146
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:56,520
I will keep her secrets,
I will obey her orders

147
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:00,800
I will ride by her side and
defend her name and honor

148
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,760
.my queen

149
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:09,000
Queen Tyranny Targaryen,
the first of her name

150
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,320
The queen of the andals and
the Roynaries and the first Men

151
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,559
The lady of the seven kingdoms
and the garden of the Realem

152
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:21,760
.your Highness

153
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,880
.wine, my queen

154
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,800
.Thank you, Rhaenyra

155
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:37,920
Come on

156
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:02,760
How are we doing?

157
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:05,920
We have 30 knights, 100
archers and 300 armed men

158
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:11,120
Dragonstone is easy to defend, but our
army is far from being a conquering army

159
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,679
I sent a message to my confidants in the city guard

160
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,280
I have some support there, but I
don't know how many people it is

161
00:20:16,439 --> 00:20:19,679
We received affidavits
from Tiger and Staunton

162
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,840
Massey, Draklin and Bar Amon

163
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,119
My mother was from the house of Erin

164
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:29,080
The people of the Bekaa will
not betray the rest of their flesh

165
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,040
The people of Naharan have always been friends,
relatives of your father, Your Highness

166
00:20:32,679 --> 00:20:36,600
With Prince Damon's consent. I
have already sent ravens to Lord Grover

167
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,720
.Lord Grover is fickle and easy to persuade

168
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:47,359
He must be convinced that our position is strong
and that we will support him if war breaks out

169
00:20:47,479 --> 00:20:49,160
.I will take care of him myself

170
00:20:49,719 --> 00:20:51,320
?What about Storm's Edge Winterfell?

171
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:54,000
Ben Stark, who forgot
an oath, was not born yet

172
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,520
And the whole North will follow
the footsteps of House Stark

173
00:20:56,599 --> 00:21:00,000
Lord Boros Baratheon must be
reminded of his father's promises

174
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,119
What's the news from Driftmark?

175
00:21:17,319 --> 00:21:19,199
.Lord Corliss sailed to Dragonstone

176
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,760
.to swear allegiance to his queen

177
00:21:22,639 --> 00:21:26,840
Valerion's fleet is under my husband's
control, and he decides where he sails

178
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,800
We will pray for your support and that of your husband

179
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:33,320
Just as we prayed every night
for the recovery of the sea serpent

180
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,840
There is no port in the narrow sea that
dares to turn Valerion's fleet into an enemy

181
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:41,359
And our enemies

182
00:21:41,479 --> 00:21:43,199
We have no friends
among the Lannisters

183
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,599
Thailand has served the king's right for
a long time, he will not rise against him

184
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,959
And Otto Hightower.
Needs a Lannister fleet

185
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,160
Without House Lannister, it is unlikely that
we will find allies west of the Gold Tooth

186
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,080
.No

187
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,840
The importance of Naharan is decisive, Your Highness

188
00:21:59,439 --> 00:22:00,720
Forgive me for my
directness, Your Highness

189
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,520
But the talk about
humans is meaningless

190
00:22:03,239 --> 00:22:08,800
You control a force unseen in
the world, from the ancient Valyria

191
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,120
.Dragons

192
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,559
...greens have dragons

193
00:22:14,639 --> 00:22:16,800
They have three adult
dragons by my count

194
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,600
We have Cyrx, Carxis and Miles

195
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:22,479
Your sons have Virmax,
Arax and Tyrrhexis

196
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:23,920
.Bayla has Mundenser

197
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,119
Damon, none of our
dragons participated in the war

198
00:22:26,199 --> 00:22:27,800
.There are other dragons without owners

199
00:22:28,639 --> 00:22:30,200
.Sismock is still alive in Driftmark

200
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:32,440
Wormythor and Silverwing.
Live on Dragonmont

201
00:22:33,199 --> 00:22:34,040
.still no riders

202
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,679
There are also three wild
dragons, all of whom nest here

203
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:38,880
And who will ride them?

204
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,280
Dragonstone has 13 to their four

205
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,719
I also have 20 eggs
incubating in Dragonmont

206
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:52,160
We need a gathering place, an outpost
that can accommodate a large force

207
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,800
Here, in Harrenhall, we will cut off the
west and crown Maale a king with the dragons

208
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:59,040
And we will be able to impale the heads
of all the greens by the end of the month

209
00:22:59,639 --> 00:23:02,639
Your Highness, a ship has been sighted off the coast

210
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,200
A single battleship flying the flag
of a three-headed green dragon

211
00:23:05,319 --> 00:23:07,199
Inform the watchtowers.
Watch the sky

212
00:23:43,479 --> 00:23:46,200
I came in the name of
Queen Dowager Alicent

213
00:23:46,599 --> 00:23:50,920
The mother of King Aegon, second to his name.
Lord and protector of the seven kingdoms

214
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:55,400
I was ordered to deliver her message
to the ears of Princess Rahinira only

215
00:23:57,199 --> 00:23:58,359
?Where is the princess?

216
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:52,519
.Princess Rheainira

217
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,600
,I am Queen Rheainira now

218
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,080
.and you all betray the kingdom

219
00:24:59,639 --> 00:25:03,360
King Aegon Targaryen,
second to his name

220
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:09,679
In his wisdom and his pursuit of peace,
he offers conditions for negotiations

221
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:16,399
Recognize Aegon as king and
swear to obey the Iron Throne

222
00:25:16,479 --> 00:25:19,920
In return, His Highness will recognize
your ownership of Dragonstone

223
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:23,960
.that it will pass to your son Jaisreez at your death

224
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:27,599
Lucris will be recognized as
the legal successor of Driftmark

225
00:25:27,719 --> 00:25:30,040
And all the lands and
property of Beit Valerion

226
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:35,200
Your sons from Prince Damon will
also gain status and respect in the court

227
00:25:35,639 --> 00:25:37,719
Young Aegon as the
king's vessel bearer

228
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,280
.Viceries will be his air conditioner

229
00:25:39,719 --> 00:25:41,679
And finally, the king in his grace

230
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:46,080
Yehon every knight and lord
who conspired against his queen

231
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:49,320
I'd rather my sons
be food for dragons

232
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,559
for carrying shields and goblets of wine

233
00:25:52,479 --> 00:25:55,960
To your freckled king,
the drunken usurper

234
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,479
Aegon Targaryen
sits on the Iron Throne

235
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:04,160
He wears the conqueror's crown
and wields the conqueror's sword

236
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,719
It is named after the conqueror

237
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:10,160
And he was anointed king by the hands
of a septon of faith in front of thousands

238
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:14,079
All the symbols of legitimacy belong to him

239
00:26:16,519 --> 00:26:21,639
And the Starks, Tully and
Baratheon also accepted

240
00:26:21,719 --> 00:26:27,040
And at this time they are considering
accepting generous terms from your king

241
00:26:28,439 --> 00:26:31,280
Stark, Tully and Baratheon
swore allegiance to me

242
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,800
When King Vaisaris
appointed me as heir

243
00:26:35,559 --> 00:26:39,679
Old Shavuot will not seat you
on the Iron Throne, princess

244
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:43,880
The order of inheritance changed
on the day your father had a son

245
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,599
I only regret that he and you
are the last to understand this

246
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,239
You are not the king's right,
just as Aegon is not the king

247
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,359
.a damned traitor

248
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,200
.a top scholar

249
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:11,840
?what the hell is this

250
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:30,360
Queen Alicent has not forgotten the
love that once existed between you

251
00:27:31,719 --> 00:27:36,360
There is no need for bloodshed
to continue peace in the kingdom

252
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:42,600
Queen Alicent is impatiently
waiting for your answer

253
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:44,880
She can get her answer now
stuck in her father's mouth

254
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,160
.with his flaccid penis

255
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,479
Let's finish the
horseshoe of this Mockion

256
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,119
Sir Eric, bring me
Lord Hightower

257
00:27:51,199 --> 00:27:52,599
.so that I will have pleasure

258
00:27:57,239 --> 00:27:58,120
.No

259
00:28:09,719 --> 00:28:11,880
My answer will be received by the King tomorrow

260
00:28:33,559 --> 00:28:36,160
It is not easy for humans to kill dragons

261
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:39,639
But dragons can slay dragons,
and have already done so

262
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,280
That's the simple truth. We
have more dragons than Aegon

263
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:47,439
Weissries talks a lot about the
history of Valyria, I know it well

264
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:53,000
When dragons flew to
war. Everything burned

265
00:28:55,239 --> 00:28:57,639
I don't want to rule a
kingdom of ashes and bones

266
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,640
Are you considering accepting
Hightower's terms, Your Highness?

267
00:29:01,439 --> 00:29:04,840
As queen, what is my true duty?
To the kingdom, Lord Bartimus

268
00:29:05,559 --> 00:29:07,040
A promise of peace and unity

269
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,880
Or will I sit on the
Iron Throne? At any cost

270
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,000
.This is your father speaking

271
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,040
My father is dead

272
00:29:14,079 --> 00:29:15,800
...and he chose me to succeed him

273
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,840
To protect the kingdom,
not to start an all-out war

274
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:21,960
.The enemy has declared war

275
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,760
What are you going to do about it?

276
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:28,960
Get out of the room

277
00:29:58,719 --> 00:29:59,960
?The possibility of war excites you

278
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,920
You cannot kneel
before the Hightowers

279
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,360
.They took away your birthright

280
00:30:03,559 --> 00:30:05,120
If you could take the iron throne

281
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,080
Without impaling Otto
Hightower's head on a stake

282
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,480
?Would you do that?  - You are not angry

283
00:30:08,639 --> 00:30:09,960
Should I declare war?
Because I'm angry

284
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:13,080
No, because as a queen, it is
your duty to suppress rebellions

285
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:16,599
You know my oath is
beyond our personal ambitions

286
00:30:19,719 --> 00:30:21,159
A Song of Ice and Fire

287
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,080
?what

288
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:29,359
The coming war against the darkness
in the north. The conqueror's dream

289
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:32,119
Viserys told about
it...when he named me heir

290
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:40,880
My brother was a slave to
prophecies and ominous signs

291
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:45,239
Everything that created the
appearance of purpose for his weak rule

292
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,520
The dreams did not make us kings

293
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,200
.the dragons did it

294
00:31:10,719 --> 00:31:11,760
.He never told you

295
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:16,800
?Right

296
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:56,559
.I beat men who fell asleep on their watch

297
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,000
You are not a man

298
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:13,679
You abandoned me when
I needed you the most

299
00:32:15,119 --> 00:32:17,000
Our two children were taken from us

300
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,760
I needed you

301
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,679
Beyla and Reyna needed you

302
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,240
And you abandoned us
for more adventures at sea

303
00:32:24,959 --> 00:32:26,599
.as you always did

304
00:32:28,679 --> 00:32:30,680
I had nowhere else to go

305
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,599
I lost everything

306
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,280
.We lost, Corliss

307
00:32:36,999 --> 00:32:38,079
.we

308
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,399
.I realized we have a new king

309
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,679
The stranger casts his
long shadow over this family

310
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:04,080
Your brother is dead too

311
00:33:09,159 --> 00:33:11,920
He hastened to bury
you and claim your seat

312
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:16,000
And stood before the king and
denounced Lenor's sons as bastards

313
00:33:21,079 --> 00:33:22,280
.Damon cut his head off for that

314
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:31,640
Hasty ambition has always been a
weak point of the House of Valerian

315
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:38,040
.You were right, Rhaenys

316
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:43,439
I aspired to too much, and in vain

317
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:48,240
Our ambition is to win the Iron Throne

318
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,199
. is over

319
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:57,320
We will not support anyone

320
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:04,679
We will retire to Hightide... and
be content with our grandchildren

321
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:08,320
.Jace, Luke and Geoff claim the crown

322
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:12,560
These children will not be
safe as long as Aegon is king

323
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:18,880
Rahinira shared in the death of our son

324
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:23,240
This girl destroys
everything she touches

325
00:34:23,319 --> 00:34:27,280
This girl is saving the
kingdom from disaster right now

326
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:30,280
All the men standing
around the painted table

327
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,000
They implore her to
send the kingdom to war

328
00:34:34,559 --> 00:34:36,959
Rahinira is the only one
who showed restraint

329
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:41,040
The purpose of war is to fill
cemeteries, dear Lord Staunton

330
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:44,199
The trick is to bury more of their people
and less of your people in the ground

331
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:46,719
It is easy for the Lord Commander to
say this from the safety of his fortress

332
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,480
That doesn't mean
it's not true, Tide Lord-

333
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,800
.Lord Corliss and Valrion

334
00:34:52,519 --> 00:34:55,239
His wife, Princess
Rhaenys Targaryen

335
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:07,400
Gentlemen

336
00:35:08,119 --> 00:35:09,079
.Lord Corliss

337
00:35:10,439 --> 00:35:12,880
What a relief to see you safe and sound

338
00:35:15,559 --> 00:35:19,760
I am very sorry for your father,
princess. He was a good man

339
00:35:31,479 --> 00:35:32,520
Where's Damon?

340
00:35:33,639 --> 00:35:36,400
There are other matters that the
prince is required to take care of

341
00:35:47,479 --> 00:35:48,760
?Your professed allies

342
00:35:50,159 --> 00:35:51,000
.Yes

343
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:53,080
Too few to win the
war for the throne

344
00:35:55,280 --> 00:36:00,360
We also hope to gain the support of
Erin, Baratheon and Stark's daughters

345
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:03,440
Hope is an ally of fools

346
00:36:04,719 --> 00:36:07,760
In the veins of the sons of Erin and
Baratheon also flows the blood of my house

347
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,800
.and they all swore allegiance to me

348
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,680
, as the Hightower House
did. If I remember correctly

349
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:15,400
.as you did, Lord Corliss

350
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:33,880
Your father's kingdom was a
kingdom of justice and honor

351
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:39,280
Our houses are connected by
common blood. A common goal

352
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:42,999
This betrayal by Hightower
must not be accepted

353
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:52,399
You have the full support
of our navy and home

354
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,160
.your Highness

355
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,439
.It is a great honor, Lord Corliss

356
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:12,640
.Princess Rhaenys

357
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:20,400
, but as I said to my flag bearers

358
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:24,560
I promised my father to see to it that
the kingdom would be strong and united

359
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:29,319
If war breaks out, it
won't be on my initiative

360
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:31,960
?You don't intend to act

361
00:37:32,119 --> 00:37:35,120
Caution is not inaction

362
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:39,960
I would like to know who my
allies are before I send them to war

363
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:52,760
, I was almost killed at Stepstones Islands

364
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,640
But as a result, we
control them now

365
00:37:56,679 --> 00:37:59,160
This time I made sure to
leave a garrison in the field

366
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:02,119
Within days there will be a complete
blockade on the shipping lanes

367
00:38:02,199 --> 00:38:03,239
.it may have already started

368
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:08,119
.The Trinity was defeated.  The narrow sea is in our hands

369
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:13,600
, if we block the pharynx

370
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:17,719
We will stop all traffic
and sea trade is king

371
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:21,440
I'll take Miles and
tour the muzzle myself

372
00:38:26,239 --> 00:38:27,639
When we stop all traffic in the narrow sea

373
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:33,000
, we can crown Maale Melech
and lay siege to the Red Fortress

374
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:35,080
.and force the greens to surrender

375
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:38,760
To obtain enough
swords to encircle a king

376
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:42,680
First we must secure the support of
Winterfell, Hatch, and Storm's Edge

377
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,639
I will prepare the
crows, Your Highness

378
00:38:45,679 --> 00:38:46,960
We need to carry these messages

379
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,040
.Mixed high-flying dragons

380
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,000
.and they are more convincing

381
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:57,880
Send us

382
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,560
.The prince is right, Your Highness

383
00:39:10,559 --> 00:39:11,359
.Fine

384
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,480
.Prince Jaisreez will fly north

385
00:39:15,559 --> 00:39:18,040
First to the Bekaa to my
mother's cousin, Lady Jane Erin

386
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:19,760
, and then to Winterfell

387
00:39:20,159 --> 00:39:22,800
Discuss with Lord Cregan Stark
with the support of the North

388
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:27,000
Prince Lucris will fly
south to the end of a storm

389
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,399
and will meet with
Lord Boros in Areatheon

390
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:33,719
We must remind
these lords of their vows

391
00:39:35,399 --> 00:39:38,000
.and the price of their violation

392
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,360
They say we are Targaryens

393
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,880
Closer to the gods
than to humans

394
00:40:08,199 --> 00:40:10,719
The Iron Throne may
bring us a little closer

395
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:16,760
But as servants of the seven kingdoms

396
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,040
We must give an
account to their gods

397
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:24,080
Go on this mission as
messengers, not as warriors

398
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,400
You will not participate in any fighting

399
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:32,320
Swear to me now in front of the seven

400
00:40:37,679 --> 00:40:44,360
.I swear

401
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:47,000
.Thanks

402
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:54,520
Kergan Stark is closer
to your age than mine

403
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:58,760
I hope that as men you
will find common interests

404
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:00,640
.Yes, Your Highness

405
00:41:09,199 --> 00:41:11,120
A short flight away from here

406
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:15,800
Areatheon blood runs through your veins,
from your grandmother's side, Rhaenys

407
00:41:16,399 --> 00:41:20,079
.And Lord Burros is a very proud man

408
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:25,920
It is an honor for him to host a
prince of the kingdom and his dragon

409
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:37,320
I expect you to
receive a warm welcome

410
00:41:39,199 --> 00:41:40,719
.Yes, mother... Your Highness

411
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,000
Get going

412
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:25,600
.I am Prince Luceris Valerion

413
00:45:26,599 --> 00:45:28,599
I have a message from the Queen to Lord Burros

414
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,719
.Prince Lucris and Valrion

415
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:55,880
The son of Princess
Rhaenyra Targaryen

416
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:02,000
, Lord Burros

417
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:05,040
I have a message from my mother

418
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:07,160
.the Queen

419
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:11,479
But earlier today I received
a messenger from the king

420
00:46:12,999 --> 00:46:16,439
?So what do we have, a king or a queen?

421
00:46:17,319 --> 00:46:19,800
It seems that the dragon's
house. I don't know who controls it

422
00:46:22,599 --> 00:46:24,480
What is the message from your mother?

423
00:46:40,559 --> 00:46:41,960
?Where is the damn scholar?

424
00:47:15,679 --> 00:47:18,880
?They remind me of my father's vow

425
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:22,280
King Aegon. At least he
came to me with an offer

426
00:47:22,519 --> 00:47:25,160
My swords and standard
bearers. For a marriage alliance

427
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:28,599
If I do what your mother asks

428
00:47:29,479 --> 00:47:31,920
...Which of my daughters will you marry?

429
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:34,479
?Boy

430
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:38,480
Sir, I am not available for marriage

431
00:47:39,639 --> 00:47:41,160
I'm already engaged

432
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:45,280
.So you came empty handed

433
00:47:47,719 --> 00:47:48,880
Come home, puppy

434
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:53,000
And tell your mother that the master
of the end of the storm is not a dog

435
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:56,040
that she can whistle at him when
necessary and accuse him of her enemies

436
00:47:58,439 --> 00:48:01,719
I will give your answer
to the Queen, sir

437
00:48:08,159 --> 00:48:09,159
.Fishing rod

438
00:48:11,439 --> 00:48:12,800
.Lord Strong

439
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:21,320
You really thought you
could fly to the kingdom

440
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:24,320
Trying to steal my brother's
kingdom? Without paying for it

441
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,239
.I won't fight you

442
00:48:28,719 --> 00:48:31,400
I came as a messenger, not as a warrior

443
00:48:31,679 --> 00:48:33,119
A battle will be a minor challenge

444
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:36,959
.No

445
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:40,200
I want you to gouge out your own eye

446
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:43,960
.as payment for my eyes

447
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:47,439
One will be enough

448
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:52,719
I won't blind you

449
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:57,960
I intend to give it as a gift to my mother

450
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:02,920
.No

451
00:49:04,319 --> 00:49:06,080
.then you are both a coward and a traitor

452
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:10,080
not here.
-Give me your eye! Or I'll take it, bastard

453
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:12,320
!Not in my hall

454
00:49:13,679 --> 00:49:14,880
, the boy came as a messenger

455
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:17,439
I will not accept
bloodshed under my roof

456
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:19,640
Return Prince
Lucris to his dragon

457
00:49:20,719 --> 00:49:21,679
.now

458
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:57,559
Concentrate!

459
00:49:58,080 --> 00:49:59,399
!Watch out, Arax

460
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:00,920
.cool down

461
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:02,719
.Listen

462
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:03,599
Obey

463
00:50:09,679 --> 00:50:11,120
.chicken, Arax

464
00:51:34,599 --> 00:51:36,959
Run away, you bastard

465
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:46,599
!Hurry up, turn away

466
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:39,440
You have a debt

467
00:52:40,719 --> 00:52:42,080
!Boy

468
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:47,719
!No, Arax

469
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:51,679
!No, Arax, serve me

470
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:55,920
,no, no, no .No, Vigar, no

471
00:52:56,199 --> 00:53:00,160
No, Weigar, no. Weigar,
no, I served!  fly up

472
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:24,400
