4
00:02:22,679 --> 00:02:23,719
here you are

5
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,839
The sea serpent will die, right?

6
00:02:39,279 --> 00:02:40,799
... (Luke) - 
 I can't be the lord of the waves

7
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,399
My grandfather was the greatest sailor the world had ever seen

8
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:47,559
As for me, I get seasick 
 Before the ships leave the port until

9
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,600
I will spoil everything

10
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,280
"I don't want to rule" Driftmark

11
00:02:53,559 --> 00:02:55,040
Sir Vimond should have inherited it.

12
00:02:55,159 --> 00:02:57,839
We can't choose our destiny, Luke. 
 Our destiny has the upper hand

13
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,440
My grandfather allowed you to choose whether you wanted to be his heir

14
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:02,960
This is what you said yourself

15
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,480
And... would you like to know the whole truth?

16
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,200
I was terrified

17
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:20,359
I was 14 years old as you are now

18
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:24,960
And I wasn't ready to be the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms

19
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,280
But... it was my duty

20
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:33,399
And over time I realized that I should be worthy of my inheritance too

21
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,440
I don't look like you

22
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,359
From what side, my dear son?

23
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,799
... I'm not

24
00:03:41,839 --> 00:03:42,640
so perfect

25
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,879
I am far from ideal

26
00:03:55,679 --> 00:03:58,960
My father took care of me and helped me prepare to fulfill my duties

27
00:03:59,559 --> 00:04:01,760
And your mother will do the same for you

28
00:04:03,359 --> 00:04:04,519
Good morning, Your Highness

29
00:04:04,839 --> 00:04:05,879
Good morning, Sir Laurent.

30
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,720
Princess Rennes just arrived by dragon

31
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,720
I have requested an urgent meeting with you and Your Highness, Prince Damon.

32
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:33,480
Princess Renee Targaryen 
Thank you, Sir Laurent.

33
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:42,040
Princess Rennes, shall we expect news of Lord Corliss' recovery?

34
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,199
Viserys is dead

35
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,560
And I'm sad to lose him with you too, Rinera.

36
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,440
...my cousin

37
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,000
Your father had a good heart

38
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,960
That's not all

39
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,200
Egon has been crowned as his successor

40
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,360
They crowned him?

41
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,000
How did Viserys die?

42
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,799
I can't say for sure

43
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,040
Since when ? - 
 It's been a day or two -

44
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,720
I was locked up in my room while the Queen made preparations

45
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:34,960
Viserys was definitely killed

46
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:41,240
And Aliscent told you to kneel to Aegon?

47
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,280
Already done

48
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,360
And she refused 
 Yet you're still alive

49
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:54,920
The High Priest himself crowned Aegon in the Dome of Dragons

50
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,440
I witnessed it with my own eyes before I ran off on Melis' back.

51
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,280
They crowned him in public?

52
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,520
To prove to the public that it is their rightful property

53
00:06:03,599 --> 00:06:06,800
That bitch queen killed my brother and stole his throne

54
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,400
And you could have burned them all because of that

55
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,080
I'm as sure of a war as I'm sure of their betrayal

56
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,520
But it's not my war to wage it myself

57
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:23,080
I was in a hurry to warn you only out of loyalty to my husband and my clan

58
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:29,719
The Green Hightowers are coming to get you, Rinera. 
 And from your children

59
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,400
You should leave Dragonstone immediately

60
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,360
The baby will be born now

61
00:07:02,119 --> 00:07:05,240
Your pregnancy isn't complete yet, this shouldn't happen now

62
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:07,719
! But it's happening right now

63
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,960
Calm down, Your Highness Princess, come

64
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:14,880
You've done this five times before

65
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:17,479
Keep your spirits, and this time will not be different

66
00:07:17,559 --> 00:07:19,920
!! Away! Away! get away

67
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:30,160
I want patrols around the island in search of 
 What small ships might anchor here?

68
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:35,240
If they attack us now, the attack will be hidden 
 And not directly

69
00:07:35,479 --> 00:07:37,400
We don't have enough men to surround the island

70
00:07:37,479 --> 00:07:39,800
But we can create the illusion that we are stronger than they are

71
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,199
You can also make use of the Dragon Guard 
 They are good fighters

72
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,519
And don't waste time

73
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:47,840
Everything will be done, Your Highness

74
00:07:59,359 --> 00:08:02,719
What was it you just did? - 
 I am sorry -

75
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:06,720
Perhaps you would like to be a little indulgent with him, Your Highness

76
00:08:07,239 --> 00:08:09,280
So that he can learn what you are trying to teach him

77
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,439
Your mother would like to meet you

78
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,719
both of you

79
00:08:16,719 --> 00:08:17,599
Mom ?

80
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,679
the curse

81
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,520
your Majesty

82
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,840
Your grandfather, King Viserys, passed away

83
00:08:39,079 --> 00:08:40,000
(Viserys)?

84
00:08:40,319 --> 00:08:44,760
The Green Party denied the Caliphate and seized the Iron Throne

85
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,559
Aegon is crowned king

86
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,080
And what are we going to do about it? - 
 nothing yet -

87
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,800
And where is Damon?

88
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,760
I don't know.. he lost his mind

89
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,159
Hurry up to plan war

90
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:04,280
I'll take care of Damon myself

91
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:05,800
... (Jess)

92
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,640
( geysers )

93
00:09:13,199 --> 00:09:16,240
Whatever right I have to claim the throne, you are now his heir

94
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,360
I forbid you to take any action without my orders

95
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,519
I got a message this morning

96
00:09:35,599 --> 00:09:38,480
It states that the serpent of the sailor has recovered and left Evenfull

97
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,359
And where is it headed? - 
 It is not clear yet, Your Highness.

98
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,920
We must send letters to our closest allies

99
00:09:44,079 --> 00:09:48,040
Lords Darkling, Massey and Barmond.

100
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,080
! (Damon)

101
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:52,040
Would you like to speak to the wise, Your Highness?

102
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:03,239
I'll fly to Riverless myself and get Lord Tully's support.

103
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,439
You won't

104
00:10:07,719 --> 00:10:10,000
My mother was ordered to refrain from any procedure while she was in childbirth

105
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,920
It's good that you're here, little prince

106
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,960
We need you to secure the airspace on the back of Fermax.

107
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,000
Did you hear what I just said?

108
00:10:27,559 --> 00:10:28,840
Handle the letters, Lord Bartmus.

109
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,079
I'll take care of it

110
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,320
Summon Sir Stefon.

111
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:35,319
The Royal Guard is wanted on the Dragon Bridge

112
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:39,520
Come with me, I will show you the true meaning of loyalty

113
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,160
You swore a covenant as a royal guard

114
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,719
As did anyone who wears the white cloak, Your Highness

115
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:54,440
To whom ?

116
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:59,080
I swore the first time to King Jerrys, Your Highness

117
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:02,920
And then to His Majesty the King (Viserys) when he succeeded him

118
00:11:03,119 --> 00:11:05,000
Do you recognize the entitlement of the caliphate dynasty?

119
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,600
yes - 
 Yes, Your Highness.

120
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:18,240
Do you remember who chose King Viserys as his successor before his death?

121
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:22,880
Princess Rinera

122
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,359
I am grateful for your service to the property for such a long time

123
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,280
And that is why I will give you an option

124
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,519
Renew your vows to Rinera by acknowledging that she is the Queen

125
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,480
And Prince Jesiris is heir to the Iron Throne

126
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,679
...and only

127
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:11,439
If you support the usurper of the throne, confess now

128
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,800
And you will have a quick and honorable death

129
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,559
... but if you choose betrayal

130
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,679
If you swear allegiance now, you will betray us later

131
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,740
... be sure that you two will die

132
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:28,820
screaming in pain

133
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,800
Princess, let us help you

134
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,760
!! get out

135
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,920
Please, Your Highness

136
00:12:45,239 --> 00:12:47,040
get out of here - 
 You shouldn't do this alone, Your Highness.

137
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,240
Let us help you

138
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,400
I do not intend to harm my brothers

139
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:34,639
I swear to use my power to protect the Queen

140
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,440
And redeem it with my blood

141
00:16:43,719 --> 00:16:45,239
.. I will not marry any woman

142
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,600
...and I won't have anything

143
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,199
And I will have no offspring

144
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:56,520
I will keep her secrets and obey her orders

145
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:00,800
I will stand by her side and defend her name and honor

146
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,760
my queen

147
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:09,000
Queen Rinera Targaryen, the first bearer of her name

148
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,320
Queen of the Andalus and Ruinar peoples and the first ancestors

149
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,559
Lady of the Seven Kingdoms and protector of the kingdom

150
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:21,760
Your Majesty

151
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,880
Here's the wine, my queen

152
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,800
Thank you, Rina.

153
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:37,920
come

154
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:02,760
What is our current position?

155
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:05,920
We have 30 knights, 100 crossbows and 300 armed men

156
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:11,120
Easy to defend "Dragonstone" but in terms of invasion 
 The army is still missing a lot

157
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,679
I sent letters to my loyalists from the city guard

158
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,280
I'll have some support there, but I can't tell how many they will be

159
00:20:16,439 --> 00:20:19,679
We already have keltigar and staunton back up.

160
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,840
Massey, Darklin and Barmond.

161
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,119
My mother was a lady of the Arin clan

162
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:29,080
The peoples of the valley will not betray the will of their king

163
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,040
The rulers of Riveran have always been close friends of your father, Your Majesty

164
00:20:32,679 --> 00:20:36,600
After Prince Damon agreed, I already sent a letter to Lord Grover

165
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,720
Lord Grover is vacillating and easy to persuade

166
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:47,359
We must be sure of the strength of our position 
 And support us if we go to war

167
00:20:47,479 --> 00:20:49,160
I will deal with him myself

168
00:20:49,719 --> 00:20:51,320
What about "Storms' End" and "Winterfell"?

169
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:54,000
We've never seen a Stark betray a covenant

170
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,520
And with the support of the Stark clan, the entire North will support us

171
00:20:56,599 --> 00:21:00,000
Lord (Burse Baratheon) must be reminded of his father's reign

172
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,119
And what's the news about Driftmark?

173
00:21:17,319 --> 00:21:19,199
Lord Corliss is sailing towards the Dragon Stone

174
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,760
To declare allegiance to his queen

175
00:21:22,639 --> 00:21:26,840
The Villaria fleet is under my husband's command 
 It is he who decides where to sail

176
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,800
We will pray for your support and your husband's support for us

177
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:33,320
As we used to pray every night for the healing of the sea serpent

178
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,840
There is no harbor by the narrow sea 
 He might want to antagonize the Villaria fleet

179
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:41,359
What about our enemies?

180
00:21:41,479 --> 00:21:43,199
We certainly have no friends in the Lannister clan

181
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,599
And (Thailand) served the King's aide for a long time 
 And he will not betray him

182
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,959
And Otto Hightower needs the Lannister fleet

183
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,160
Without the Lannister clan, we are unlikely to have 
On any western allies, Golden Tooth

184
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,080
both

185
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,840
Riverland is essential, Your Majesty

186
00:21:59,439 --> 00:22:00,720
Forgive my frankness, Your Majesty

187
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,520
But the discussion about humans is useless

188
00:22:03,239 --> 00:22:08,800
Your court has powers the world has never seen 
Since the Old Testament of Philaria

189
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,120
dragons

190
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,559
The Green Party has dragons too

191
00:22:14,639 --> 00:22:16,800
They have three mature dragons by my calculations

192
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,600
And we have Syracuses, Keraxes and Melis.

193
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:22,479
Your sons have Vermax, Arax and Tyrax.

194
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:23,920
Bella has a moondancer.

195
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,119
Damon, none of our dragons participated in a war before

196
00:22:26,199 --> 00:22:27,800
There are also dragons without patrons

197
00:22:28,639 --> 00:22:30,200
Sismoke is still at driftmark

198
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:32,440
Fermathur and Silverwing on Dragon Mountain

199
00:22:33,199 --> 00:22:34,040
They are still without horses

200
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,679
And there are also three wild dragons, they all live here

201
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:38,880
And who will lead it?

202
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,280
There are 13 dragons in addition to the original four

203
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,719
I also have some eggs in the incubator on Dragon Mountain

204
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:52,160
We need a gathering point, a base big enough to fit us

205
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,800
Here at Harrenhal, we will isolate the West like this 
 We surround Kingslanding with dragons

206
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:59,040
This is how we can eliminate all members of the Green Party before the end of the damned month

207
00:22:59,639 --> 00:23:02,639
Your Majesty, a ship has been spotted off the harbor

208
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,200
"Big Ship Flying the Flag" Three Green Dragon Heads

209
00:23:05,319 --> 00:23:07,199
Inform the control teams, and watch the air range

210
00:23:43,479 --> 00:23:46,200
I'm here on behalf of the Queen Dowager Alicent.

211
00:23:46,599 --> 00:23:50,920
King's mother (Aegon), the second bearer of his name 
 Lord and protector of the Seven Kingdoms

212
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:55,400
I received orders to deliver her message to Princess Rinira only

213
00:23:57,199 --> 00:23:58,359
Where is your highness princess?

214
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:52,519
HRH Princess Rinera

215
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,600
I am Queen Rinera now

216
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,080
And you are all traitors to the kingdom

217
00:24:59,639 --> 00:25:03,360
King (Aegon Targaryen) is the second bearer of his name

218
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:09,679
In his wisdom and desire for peace, he offered negotiating terms

219
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:16,399
Confess Aegon as king 
 And I swear to obey the Sovereignty of the Iron Throne

220
00:25:16,479 --> 00:25:19,920
And in return, His Majesty will acknowledge your ownership of the Dragon Stone

221
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:23,960
And your firstborn son (Jeseris) will inherit it at your death

222
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:27,599
The right to succession to Luceres will be recognized by Driftmark

223
00:25:27,719 --> 00:25:30,040
And all the lands and possessions of the Villaria clan

224
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:35,200
And your sons who are descendants of Prince (Damon) will also receive a high position in the royal court

225
00:25:35,639 --> 00:25:37,719
Little Egon will be carrying his shields

226
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,280
And Viserys will bear his cup

227
00:25:39,719 --> 00:25:41,679
And finally, the king in good faith

228
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:46,080
He will pardon any knight or lord who conspires against his ascension to the throne

229
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:51,559
I'd rather feed my sons to dragons before I make them pregnant 
 Shields and cups

230
00:25:52,479 --> 00:25:55,960
For the sake of your king, the usurper, the drunken asshole

231
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,479
Aegon Targaryen ascends the Iron Throne

232
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:04,160
He wears the crown of the victor and carries his sword

233
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,719
And bears the name of the victor

234
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:10,160
He was crowned by a religious priest in front of thousands of commoners

235
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:14,079
And all conditions of eligibility belong to him

236
00:26:16,519 --> 00:26:27,040
There are also the Stark, Baratheon and Tully clans 
 Those who have also received and are currently considering adequate terms from the King

237
00:26:28,439 --> 00:26:31,280
The Stark, Tully and Parthion clans swore allegiance to me

238
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,800
When King Viserys chose me as his heir

239
00:26:35,559 --> 00:26:39,679
Old Testaments won't put you on the Iron Throne, Princess

240
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:43,880
The dynasty of the caliphate changed the day your father's first son was born

241
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,599
What I regret is that you and he were the last to comprehend this

242
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,239
You are not the king's assistant, as Egon is not the king

243
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,359
You damn traitor

244
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,200
High Priest

245
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:11,840
What the fuck is this?

246
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:30,360
Queen Aliscent has not forgotten the love that once brought you together

247
00:27:31,719 --> 00:27:36,360
No need for bloodshed 
 May the kingdom go on living in peace

248
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:42,600
Queen Aliscent is eagerly waiting for your answer

249
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:46,160
She can get her answer right away 
 Inside her father's mouth with some of his dismembered organs

250
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,479
We will not end this farce

251
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:52,599
Sir Eric, bring me Lord Hightower. 
 To have the honor of killing him myself

252
00:27:57,239 --> 00:27:58,120
both

253
00:28:09,719 --> 00:28:11,880
Tomorrow, King's Landing will receive my answer

254
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:36,160
It's not easy for humans to be dragon slayers

255
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:39,630
But dragons can kill humans, 
I have done this before

256
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,280
But the obvious fact is that we have 
More dragons than Aegon

257
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:47,430
The Wisers talk a lot about the history of the Valerians.
I know this very well

258
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:53,000
When dragons fly to war, everything burns

259
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:57,630
I didn't want to rule a kingdom full of ashes and bones

260
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,640
Would you consider accepting the terms of Clan Hightower, Your Majesty?

261
00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:04,840
As Queen, what are my true duties to the kingdom, Lord (Bartimus)?

262
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:07,040
To make sure that peace and unity are spread

263
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,880
Or sit on the Iron Throne at all costs?

264
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,000
This is what your father said

265
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,040
My father passed away

266
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:15,800
I chose to be his heir

267
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,840
To protect the kingdom, not to enter it with all-out war

268
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:21,960
Our enemy has declared war

269
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,760
What are you going to do about it?

270
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:28,960
clear the room

271
00:29:58,710 --> 00:29:59,960
Does the prospect of war excite you?

272
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,920
You can't submit to the Hightower clan.

273
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,360
They stole your rights

274
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:05,120
If you could seize the Iron Throne

275
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,080
Without putting the head of Otto Hightower. 
on shaft

276
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,480
- Would you do that?
- Aren't you angry?

277
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:09,960
Should I teach war because I am angry?

278
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:13,080
No, but your duty as a queen is to quell rebellions

279
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:16,590
You know my oath is beyond our personal ambitions

280
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:21,150
A song of ice and fire

281
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,080
What?

282
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:29,350
The coming war against darkness in the north
 victor's dream

283
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:32,110
Viserys told me this when he made me heiress

284
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:40,880
My brother was a slave to prophecies and ominous signs

285
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:45,230
He would do anything to make his weak judgment purposeful

286
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,520
It is not dreams that make us kings

287
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,200
But the dragons did

288
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:11,760
He never told you

289
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:16,800
Right?

290
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:56,550
I flog men for sleeping during probation time

291
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,000
You are not a man

292
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:13,670
You left me when I needed you most

293
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:17,000
Both of our children were kidnapped from us

294
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,760
I need you

295
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,670
Bella and Bina needed you

296
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,240
And you left us for more adventures at sea

297
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:26,590
Like I always did

298
00:32:28,670 --> 00:32:30,680
I had nowhere else to turn to

299
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,590
I lost everything

300
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,280
We lost, Corliss.

301
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:38,070
we

302
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,390
I heard we have a new king

303
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,670
The stranger casts his long shadow over this family

304
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:04,080
Your brother died too

305
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:11,920
Hurry up to bury you and claim your place

306
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:16,000
He stood before the king and announced that Lenore's children
They are illegitimate children

307
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:22,280
Damon killed him because of it

308
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:31,640
It has always been an ambitious ambition
 A weak point in the valerian family.

309
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:38,040
You were right, Raines.

310
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:43,430
I longed for so much,
And it was in vain

311
00:33:45,670 --> 00:33:48,240
Our ambition to win the Iron Throne

312
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,190
come to an end

313
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:57,320
We will not support anyone anymore

314
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:04,670
We'll go to Hightide and have our grandchildren suffice

315
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:08,320
Jace, Luke, and Geoff.
Crown Princes

316
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:12,560
These boys will not be safe 
As long as Aegon was the king

317
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:18,880
Rinera was complicit in the death of our son

318
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:23,240
That girl destroys everything she touches

319
00:34:23,310 --> 00:34:27,280
That girl is the one who brings the kingdom's diaspora together right now

320
00:34:28,390 --> 00:34:30,280
All the men standing around the table

321
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,000
They pleaded with her to send men to war

322
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:36,950
Rinera was the only one who... 
Show self-control

323
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:41,040
The purpose of war is to fill the graves, dear Lord Staunton.

324
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:44,190
The trick is to bury more of them and less of us

325
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:46,710
It is easy for a commander to say this to protect his fortress

326
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,480
- That doesn't make it untrue
- Lord (Tide)

327
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,800
Lord (Corlis Valerian)

328
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:55,230
And his wife, Princess Reigns Targaryen.

329
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:07,400
Gentlemen

330
00:35:08,110 --> 00:35:09,070
Lord (Corlis)

331
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:12,880
It's comforting to see you standing and healthy again

332
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:19,760
I'm so sorry about your father princess he was a good man

333
00:35:31,470 --> 00:35:32,520
Where is Damon?

334
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:36,400
There are other matters of interest to the Prince at the moment

335
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:48,760
Are these your avowed allies?

336
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:51,000
yes

337
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:53,080
They are less than winning a battle for the throne

338
00:35:55,280 --> 00:36:00,360
We were also hoping for the support of the Irene, Baratheon, and Stark clans.

339
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:03,440
Hope is the ally of fools

340
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:07,760
Both clans of Irene and Baratheon.
They share blood with my family

341
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,800
But they all swore allegiance to me

342
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,680
Like the Hightower clan did, as I remember

343
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:15,400
As you did, Lord Corliss.

344
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:33,880
Your father's kingdom was all about justice and honor

345
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:39,280
Our families share blood and purpose

346
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:42,990
This Hightower clan's treachery cannot be accepted

347
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:52,390
You have the full support of our fleet and our family

348
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,160
Your Majesty

349
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,430
It is an honor for me, Lord Corliss.

350
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:12,640
Princess (Rennes)

351
00:37:17,350 --> 00:37:20,400
But as I said to the banner campaign

352
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:24,560
I promised my father to keep the kingdom strong and united

353
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:29,310
If war breaks out 
It won't be the first blow on my hand

354
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:31,960
Do you not intend to attack?

355
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:35,120
Caution does not mean inaction

356
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:39,960
I would like to know who my allies are before I send them to war

357
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:52,760
As a result of my imminent death in the Step Stones.

358
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,640
is that we rule it now

359
00:37:56,670 --> 00:37:59,160
This time I made sure to leave a garrison in the field

360
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:02,110
In a matter of days there will be a complete blockade of the shipping lanes

361
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:03,230
That is if they haven't already

362
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:08,110
The Trinity was defeated, and the sea became ours again

363
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:13,600
If we close the entrance

364
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:17,710
We can cut off all trade and sea travel to the king's lands

365
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:21,440
I'll take Melis and secure the entrance myself

366
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:27,630
When we close the narrow entrance to the sea

367
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:33,000
We can besiege the king's lands and besiege the red castle

368
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:35,080
We force the Green Party to surrender

369
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:38,760
If we had enough soldiers to besiege the king's lands

370
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:42,680
First we have to make sure that we support 
The Winterfell, Hutch, and Storm Edge clans.

371
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,630
I will prepare the crows, my lady

372
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:46,960
We have to send these messages

373
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,040
Dragons can fly faster than crows

374
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,000
It is more persuasive

375
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:57,880
Send us

376
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,560
The prince is right, my lady

377
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:11,350
Good

378
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,480
Prince Jesiris will fly north

379
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:18,040
First to the Bekaa for my mother's cousin, Lady Jane Irene.

380
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:19,760
And then to Winterville.

381
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:22,800
Discuss it with Lord Kerrigan Stark to get support from the North

382
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:27,000
Prince Luceres will fly south to Storm's End

383
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,390
And he makes a pact with Lord Boros Baratheon.

384
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:33,710
We have to remind these lords of the promises they swore

385
00:39:35,390 --> 00:39:38,000
And what will it cost them if they violate it?

386
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,360
They say we are a Targaryen clan.

387
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,880
Closer to God than humans

388
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:10,710
And maybe the Iron Throne puts us a little closer

389
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:16,760
But, if we were to serve the Seven Kingdoms

390
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,040
We must respond to their gods

391
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:24,080
If you accept this task,
You will go as messengers, not as warriors

392
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,400
You should not take part in any fight

393
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:32,320
I swear it now before the seven gods

394
00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:44,360
I swear by this

395
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:47,000
Thank you

396
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:54,520
Kerrigan Stark is closer to your age than me

397
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:58,760
I hope you guys find common interests

398
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:00,640
present my lady

399
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:11,120
Storms and End near here

400
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:15,800
The blood of the Baratheon clan runs through your veins
 From your grandmother's side, Raines.

401
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:20,070
And Lord Burroughs is a very proud man

402
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:25,920
It is an honor for him to host the prince of the kingdom and his dragon

403
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:37,320
I expect you to get a warm reception

404
00:41:39,190 --> 00:41:40,710
Present mom, I mean madam

405
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,000
go then

406
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:25,600
I am Prince (Luciris Valerian)

407
00:45:26,590 --> 00:45:28,590
I bring a letter from the Queen to Lord Boros.

408
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,710
Prince (Luciris Valerian)

409
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:55,880
Son of Princess Rinera Targaryen

410
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:02,000
Lord (Poros)

411
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:05,040
I bring you a message from my mother

412
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:07,160
the Queen

413
00:46:08,630 --> 00:46:11,470
But I received a letter from the King earlier today

414
00:46:12,990 --> 00:46:16,430
So what will it be, king or queen?

415
00:46:17,310 --> 00:46:19,800
Looks like the Dragon Family doesn't know who's ruling it right now

416
00:46:22,590 --> 00:46:24,480
What is your mother's message?

417
00:46:40,550 --> 00:46:41,960
Where is the damn world?

418
00:47:15,670 --> 00:47:18,880
Remind me of my dad's oath?

419
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:22,280
At least King Aegon made an offer

420
00:47:22,510 --> 00:47:25,160
My soldiers and flag bearers in exchange for a marriage agreement

421
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:28,590
If you do what your mother asks

422
00:47:29,470 --> 00:47:31,920
Which of my daughters will you marry?

423
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:34,470
boy?

424
00:47:35,510 --> 00:47:38,480
Sir, I am not available for marriage

425
00:47:39,630 --> 00:47:41,160
I'm already engaged

426
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:45,280
So I came with empty hands

427
00:47:47,710 --> 00:47:48,880
Go home, baby

428
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:53,000
And tell your mother that the lord of clan Storm
 not a dog

429
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:56,040
She can call him when she needs to to unleash him against her enemies

430
00:47:58,430 --> 00:48:01,710
I will pass your answer to the Queen, sir

431
00:48:08,150 --> 00:48:09,150
Slown down

432
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:12,800
Oh Lord (Strong)

433
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:21,320
Did you really think you could fly to the kingdom

434
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:24,320
Trying to steal my brother's throne without paying a price?

435
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,230
I won't fight you

436
00:48:28,710 --> 00:48:31,400
I came as a messenger, not as a warrior

437
00:48:31,670 --> 00:48:33,110
The fight will be a simple challenge

438
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:36,950
no

439
00:48:38,070 --> 00:48:40,200
I want you to gouge out your eye

440
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:43,960
price for my eyes

441
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:47,430
One will do

442
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:52,710
I will not blind you

443
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:57,960
I intend to give it as a gift to my mother

444
00:49:02,070 --> 00:49:02,920
no

445
00:49:04,310 --> 00:49:06,080
So you are a coward and a traitor

446
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:10,080
- not here!
- Give me your eye, or I'll rip it out, you bastard!

447
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:12,320
Not in my castle

448
00:49:13,670 --> 00:49:14,880
The boy came as a messenger

449
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:17,430
I will not allow blood to be spilled in my place

450
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:19,640
Escort Prince Luceres to his dragon

451
00:49:20,710 --> 00:49:21,670
right Now

452
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:57,550
to focus!

453
00:49:58,080 --> 00:49:59,390
Watch out, Arax.

454
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:00,920
be quiet!

455
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:02,710
listen!

456
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:03,590
obey

457
00:50:09,670 --> 00:50:11,120
Fly oh (Arax)

458
00:51:34,590 --> 00:51:36,950
Run away you bastard

459
00:51:45,110 --> 00:51:46,590
Hurry up, turn around

460
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:39,440
you have a religion

461
00:52:40,710 --> 00:52:42,080
Oh boy!

462
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:47,710
No, Arax!

463
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:51,670
No, Arax, obey my commands

464
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:55,920
No, no, no, no, Vigar.

465
00:52:56,190 --> 00:53:00,160
No, Vigar, obey my orders, fly up, Vigar.

466
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:24,400
No, Vigar, no, no

467
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:23,860
