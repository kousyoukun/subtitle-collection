1
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:29,940
Uh, so my name's Ray.

2
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:33,110
I'm, uh, Brittany's dad.

3
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,460
I work in the security industry.

4
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:40,100
So, basically, I work in a club.

5
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:42,380
And, um...

6
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:44,400
you know, my job is to kind of make sure

7
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:46,180
that people behave themselves

8
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:49,210
while they're in the... in the club.

9
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:51,750
Yeah, love?

10
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,980
Are you a bouncer?

11
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:56,600
Uh... Mm.

12
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:58,840
Yeah, there's a bit
more to it than that,

13
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:00,760
but, yeah, basically, um,

14
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:02,740
yeah, I'm a bouncer. Yeah, man?

15
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:04,770
You're pretty small for a bouncer.

16
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,800
Yeah, I guess, but, um,

17
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:09,779
it's not the size of the
dog in the fight, mate.

18
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:11,350
What does that mean?

19
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,320
Well, it's not the size
of the dog in the fight,

20
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:15,489
it's the size of the fight in the dog.

21
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:18,119
I don't get it.

22
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,910
Um...

23
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:24,860
Well, in a fight, what matters
is how much heart you've got.

24
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:27,209
That's kind of what decides a fight.

25
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:28,930
- Yeah, man?
- Do you think you could beat

26
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:30,000
my dad in a fight?

27
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:33,049
Well, I've never met
him, but, um, I'd...

28
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:34,969
I'd say...

29
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:38,630
- probably not.
- What about Conor McGregor?

30
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,840
Uh, uh, definitely,

31
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:42,809
definitely couldn't beat
Conor McGregor. Yeah, love?

32
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:44,560
Is your job dangerous?

33
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:49,280
Um...

34
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:50,940
No. Not really, no.

35
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:52,689
I wouldn't say it was. Yeah, mate?

36
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:54,279
Have you ever killed anybody?

37
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,390
Uh, once.

38
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,239
Really? What happened?

39
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,370
Uh, this kid was asking
me too many questions.

40
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:05,619
I'm just kidding, mate.
I'm just kidding.

41
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:09,160
Uh, okay, man.

42

43
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:24,450
What, no socks went out of
fashion, did they, mate?

44
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:27,059
Your mate beat the shit
out of old Stan last night.

45
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:28,360
Dirk?

46
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:30,860
Yeah.

47
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:32,279
What happened?

48
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,760
Stan was getting flirty with Giselle.

49
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:36,569
You know, nothing out of the usual.

50
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:38,560
- Mm.
- Your mate comes in

51
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:39,659
like a bull at a gate,

52
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,329
starts getting rough.

53
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:43,869
Stan said something...
I don't know what.

54
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:46,620
Next second, old Stan's
laying on the ground,

55
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:47,919
getting his head stomped on.

56
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,830
Is he all right?

57
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,240
No, he's not all right.

58
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:54,380
I had to get Mandy to
take him to the hospital.

59
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:57,219
Now, I know he's your mate
and all, but he's got to go.

60
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:59,800
Mm.

61
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:13,470
Hello?

62
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,400
It's me.

63
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,850
Hi, mate.

64
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:19,060
How you doing?

65
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:20,310
Eh.

66
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,540
Feeling all right?

67
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:24,150
Yes, pretty much.

68
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:30,879
Not a bad joint.

69
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,490
Yeah, it's...

70
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:36,160
... all I can bloody afford, isn't it?

71
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:37,380
You want a drink or something, mate?

72
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:40,920
A sandwich? Some pharmaceuticals?

73
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:42,160
Nah, I'm good.

74
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:49,730
So you beat the shit
out of old Stan, eh?

75
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:55,440
- Yeah.
- Ooh.

76
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:58,690
He was getting pretty
handsy with, um, Giselle.

77
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,480
Mm.

78
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:03,280
As usual.

79
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:05,950
Dirty old bugger.

80
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,700
Well...

81
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:11,540
Got to fire you.

82
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,120
Oh, mate.

83
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,379
I'll leave you to it, all right?

84
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:19,280
Ray.

85
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:21,470
Ray.

86
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,760
Yeah?

87
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,680
I don't want your money, mate.

88
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:36,859
Do you think...

89
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:38,820
how do I put this... do you think

90
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:41,069
there is a difference
in the act of killing

91
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:43,990
between when you were in the Army

92
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,159
and-and what you do now?

93
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,660
Does-does it feel any different?

94
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:51,329
No.

95
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:53,240
No difference at all?

96
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:55,950
No, killing's killing. Mm.

97
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:58,160
You know, you get medals in the Army

98
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:00,100
for when you kill people, but, you know,

99
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:01,320
I don't get those
anymore, but, you know...

100
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:04,000
Yeah. I can't imagine
hit men get medals.

101
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:05,720
Nah. We get paid better though, so...

102
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:09,139
Yeah? No one tells you what to do now.

103
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:11,950
Yeah. You know, if I want
to do a job, I do it.

104
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,880
If I don't want to do a job, I don't.

105
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:15,200
You know, I can say no.

106
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:17,359
- Yes or no.
- Mm.

107
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,490
Do you ever feel sorry
for any of your victims?

108
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:25,569
Not really, no.

109
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:27,199
Never?

110
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,289
Why would I?

111
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:30,950
Well, what about their families?

112
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:33,680
What about 'em?

113
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:34,900
Well, doesn't it ever bother you...

114
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:36,640
you know, the pain that you're causing

115
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:39,499
the loved ones that are
left behind, grieving for...

116
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,960
for the person that
you've just murdered?

117
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:51,410
You know, I killed people when
I was in the Army, you know?

118
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:52,530
Nobody, you know...

119
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:53,889
They had families, so...

120
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:55,700
Yeah, sure, but I think...

121
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:57,100
you know, I think the
difference is choice.

122
00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:00,470
When you're in the Army,
you-you don't have a choice.

123
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,820
But here, you-you do.
You've got a choice.

124
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:04,200
- You don't actually have to do this job.
- No, no, no,

125
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:05,520
- no, no, no, no, no.
- You could... I mean, you could choose

126
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:07,720
- to do something different.
- No, no, no, no.

127
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:10,070
I chose to join the Army.

128
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,100
You know, I could say, like,
somebody put a gun to my head

129
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:14,240
and said you got to join
the army or, you know...

130
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:16,380
I had a choice. That's-that's
what I decided to do.

131
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:18,020
I was gonna go over there
and fucking kill people,

132
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:19,030
- so...
- Yeah, okay.

133
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,750
You got no problem with that.

134
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:23,760
- Okay.
- As soon as I come back here

135
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:25,500
and I start doing the same thing,

136
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:26,780
suddenly you're all, fucking,

137
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:28,320
I don't know, "high
and mighty" about it.

138
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:29,930
Like, you know...

139
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:32,570
like I should feel bad
about it or something.

140
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:34,679
- Should I feel bad about it?
- Uh,

141
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,670
I'm-I'm just asking a question.

142
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,649
Yeah, you're asking some questions.

143
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:40,980
Yeah. It's the questions you're asking,

144
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:42,859
- you know what I mean?
- Well, okay, well, so,

145
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,859
what about... what about your daughter?

146
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:47,660
I mean, you-you know,
from what you've told me,

147
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:50,070
you really love her.
I'm sure she loves you.

148
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,090
Surely she'd be really,
you know, devastated

149
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,400
if something happened to you.

150
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:06,570
- Hey, my friend.
- Hi.

151
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:09,880
Get that one and a pack
of John Kelsey's, friend.

152
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:17,690
Money, champ.

153
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:26,700
Thanks, mate.

154
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:38,200
Could've just had one of these, prez.

155
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:40,280
No, I don't smoke that.

156
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:42,100
What's wrong with them?

157
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:44,800
It's all the chemicals,
mate. It tastes like shit.

158
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,650
Oi.

159
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:54,410
What, are you stalking me, mate?

160
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:57,139
- Hey? How are you?
- Hey, good.

161
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:58,889
What you doing... What the fuck?! Jesus.

162
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:02,809
Get him!

163
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:05,290
Hold him, hold him, hold him.

164
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:07,230
- Got him.
- Hold him.

165
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,899
- Kev!
- I got him.

166
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,860
Kev!

167
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:12,560
I got him. Got him.

168
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:14,370
Kev!

169
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:15,659
I got you.

170
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:17,860
Good? Let's get out of here.

171
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:19,200
Let's go, mate.

172
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:21,620
Kev!

173
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:43,500
So who's paying you?

174
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:45,110
Your VP.

175
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:48,069
Alex?

176
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:49,950
Mm-hmm.

177
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:55,520
Jesus. Fuck.

178
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:03,579
Uh, you got a smoke?

179
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:05,669
Quit.

180
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,920
You quit?

181
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:10,360
Good for you, mate.

182
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:12,469
I got some rollies in me pocket.

183
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:14,090
You good I get 'em out?

184
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,180
Hey, go for it.

185
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:25,979
They paying you all right?

186
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:28,350
Yeah.

187
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,700
Mind me asking how much?

188
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:36,400
- $250.
- Fuck.

189
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:37,740
Jesus. Yeah, well, you're good.

190
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,030
I'll give you that.

191
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,950
I never saw it coming.

192
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:44,249
Nothing personal.

193
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,060
Yeah, I know.

194
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:49,000
I'm surprised I've fucking lived
this long, to tell you the truth.

195
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:50,610
Mm.

196
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:54,620
I'm guessing if I was
to try and buy you out,

197
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:56,800
you'd just pocket the
cash and kill me anyway.

198
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,389
Still got to get your $250.

199
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:02,950
Mm-hmm.

200
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:20,880
It was weird, but...

201
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:23,420
I mean, I'd never shot
any bloke before that.

202
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:25,120
And it's not like it is
in the movies, right?

203
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:27,000
- It's different.
- Mm.

204
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:28,330
And this fellow, I remember,

205
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:31,780
his legs went all sort of wobbly

206
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:34,070
and sat down on the floor.

207
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,969
He just looked real fucking tired,

208
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:38,480
you know. Just real tired.

209
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:39,799
He looked up at me, you know.

210
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,820
He sort of looked me right in the eye.

211
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:45,600
Just said, "Fuck, mate."

212
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:46,620
Then he just...

213
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:49,170
That was it.

214
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:51,770
Lights went out of his eyes.

215
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:58,160
20 years, and that bloke still
comes to me in my dreams.

216
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:02,000
Every time I see him, he just...

217
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:04,020
looks at me with this look, you know.

218
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,450
That same look.

219
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:07,999
Doesn't say anything, just...

220
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,140
just looks at me.

221
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:13,210
Scares the shit out of me.

222
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:19,260
You don't get that?

223
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:24,840
Blokes you've knocked come
to you in your dreams?

224
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:27,530
Sometimes.

225
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:29,689
Doesn't bother you?

226
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,319
Bothers the shit out of me.

227
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,699
Not enough to make you
want to quit, though.

228
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:43,790
Every job's got its downside, man.

229
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:03,560
Come on, mate.

230
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:04,980
Right, eh?

231
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:06,610
Let him go, man.

232
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:18,180
Keep an eye out.

233
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:20,490
Cool.

234
00:12:58,130 --> 00:12:59,790
Top spot.

235
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,530
Yeah.

236
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:09,370
I'll see you in your dreams.

237
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:07,350
Yeah?

238
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:26,570
Ooh.

239
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:31,120
So what happened?

240
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:34,310
I was asleep upstairs, woke up.

241
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,960
Saw a light, uh, spinning around.

242
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:39,129
- Mm.
- Got up, went to the money room.

243
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:41,780
Got clocked as soon as I
walked in the fucking door.

244
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:43,060
Did you get a look at him?

245
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:45,060
Nah. It was too fucking dark.

246
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:46,920
What about the CCTV?

247
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:49,000
Yeah, I got about 30
seconds of the prick.

248
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:50,330
- Mm.
- He got in back here.

249
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:52,630
- Yeah.
- Knew what he was doing.

250
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:58,700
How much did he get?

251
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:01,860
The night's takings.

252
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:07,410
It's Dirk.

253
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:15,530
Fucking little...

254
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:20,090
I give the guy a job.

255
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,400
I treat him like a fucking...

256
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:24,700
Shit.

257
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:28,550
I know he's your mate and
all, but I want him gone.

258
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:35,070
- What do you mean, gone?
- I mean gone-gone.

259
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,309
I'm not gonna whack him.

260
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:39,290
Yeah, well, I'll find somebody who will.

261
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:46,410
Oh!

262
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:48,660
Bloody hell, Ray.

263
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:51,620
Wakey, wakey.

264
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:53,219
What's going on?

265
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,150
Need a favor.

266
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:57,100
What?

267
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:58,550
Need some backup.

268
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:21,790
Mm.

269
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:29,820
Smoke, Ray?

270
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:30,919
Nah, I quit.

271
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,660
- What?
- Mm.

272
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:33,730
When?

273
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:35,230
About a month ago.

274
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,230
Cold turkey?

275
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,769
Yeah, I started cold turkey, but...

276
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:42,700
I was just getting too fucking
angry all of a sudden.

277
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:45,100
I had to get on the fucking patches.

278
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:48,140
- That work?
- Yeah, they do.

279
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:49,680
You start off...

280
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:52,580
Like, you start off with
the strong... ones.

281
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:54,010
- Mm.
- And then, like, you have them

282
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:56,680
for a week, and then you go to the next,

283
00:17:56,690 --> 00:17:58,260
- you know, less strong...
- Yeah.

284
00:17:58,270 --> 00:17:59,900
- ... less strong week by week.
- Yeah.

285
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:02,960
And, yeah... eventually...
you know, got off 'em.

286
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:04,360
- Wow.
- You thinking of quitting,

287
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:07,370
- are you?
- No. God, no.

288
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:30,790
It's fresh.

289
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:34,960
It's romantic.

290
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:51,480
What's going on, Ray?

291
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:03,680
You got to leave town, mate.

292
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:05,680
What?

293
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:08,830
I know you ripped Freddy off.

294
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:13,020
You got to go, mate.

295
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:16,110
You got to go today, and
you can't ever come back.

296
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:26,420
Yeah. Nah, fuck that.

297
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,720
You got to go.

298
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,700
Or what?

299
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:43,930
Are you gonna shoot me?

300
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:47,540
Do it.

301
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:03,990
You remember when I killed
that kid in Uyghur prov?

302
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:09,060
Mm.

303
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:14,200
That was it for me.

304
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:20,379
It's like...

305
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:23,520
... my life had promise,

306
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:24,760
you know?

307
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:27,810
Had a... spark.

308
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:35,920
Then, after that, just...

309
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:47,960
Mate, pick a spot.

310
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:50,870
Anywhere. All right?

311
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:54,280
Anywhere you want to go,

312
00:20:54,290 --> 00:20:55,380
- you know?
- Mm.

313
00:20:57,470 --> 00:20:59,270
I'll drive you, all right?

314
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,379
I'll set you up.

315
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:03,870
You know, get you on your feet.

316
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:06,180
Okay.

317
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:40,090
Hey, sorry about all
that shit with Freddy.

318
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:43,760
Forget it.

319
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:49,640
Come on.

320
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:52,180
Nah.

321
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:56,190
I got to go.

322
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,830
Sorry.

323
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:35,350
