1
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:19,344

carlo: Yeah, I started the hostility log thing this week.

2
00:01:19,447 --> 00:01:20,946

How's that working out?

3
00:01:21,048 --> 00:01:22,614

Oh, yeah, good, yeah.

4
00:01:22,716 --> 00:01:26,785

Um, had a bit of a situation Wednesday with somebody.

5
00:01:26,887 --> 00:01:31,156

Yeah, it was just some guy eyeballing me at the pub.

6
00:01:31,258 --> 00:01:32,925

But I was getting pretty pissed

7
00:01:33,027 --> 00:01:35,994

and I used the stop technique, you know, we spoke about.

8
00:01:36,097 --> 00:01:37,729

So, yeah, I'm...I'm getting pretty good at it.

9
00:01:37,832 --> 00:01:39,665

- So that's good. - Great.

10
00:01:39,767 --> 00:01:42,668

Um, ray, how have you been?

11
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:44,570

Yeah, good, mate.

12
00:01:44,672 --> 00:01:46,305

- Yeah? - Yep.

13
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:51,677

Is there anything you want to talk about?

14
00:01:51,779 --> 00:01:53,512

No. I'm good.

15
00:01:53,614 --> 00:01:55,347

Are you sure? Nothing at all?

16
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:58,016

Hmph.

17
00:01:58,119 --> 00:02:01,553

I beat my, uh, girlfriend's brother up over christmas.

18
00:02:03,491 --> 00:02:05,858

Ok, um...

19
00:02:07,728 --> 00:02:09,795

..What happened?

20
00:02:09,897 --> 00:02:12,564

I went round to her parents' place

21
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:18,070

and, um, you know, we did the whole secret santa thing.

22
00:02:18,172 --> 00:02:19,972

Me daughter got this unicorn candle,

23
00:02:20,074 --> 00:02:22,407

which she was pretty chuffed about.

24
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:25,077

And me girlfriend's brother decided he wanted it

25
00:02:25,179 --> 00:02:28,247

and when it was his turn he took it off her.

26
00:02:28,349 --> 00:02:29,848

So you assaulted him?

27
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:32,084

Well, he was being a dickhead, so, you know...

28
00:02:32,186 --> 00:02:34,720

- So you assaulted him? - Yeah, pretty much.

29
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:39,124

And how did your girlfriend feel about this?

30
00:02:39,226 --> 00:02:41,059

Well, she's not my girlfriend anymore, so...

31
00:02:41,162 --> 00:02:44,062

- Shit. Sorry, mate. - Mmm.

32
00:02:44,165 --> 00:02:46,632

I mean, I...You know,

33
00:02:46,734 --> 00:02:48,634

without wanting to state the obvious,

34
00:02:48,736 --> 00:02:53,639

can you see how violence is perhaps not the best way

35
00:02:53,741 --> 00:02:54,373

for you to resolve your disputes?

36
00:02:56,677 --> 00:02:58,744

No, I think it generally is.

37
00:02:58,846 --> 00:03:00,312

But, you know, just don't do it

38
00:03:00,414 --> 00:03:02,748

in front of your girlfriend, you know?

39
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:04,983

uh, what's great about it?

40
00:03:05,085 --> 00:03:07,152

It doesn't seem to have worked for you this time.

41
00:03:07,254 --> 00:03:09,454

Yeah, well, sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't, you know?

42
00:03:09,557 --> 00:03:13,158

Can you give me one example of violence ever working?

43
00:03:16,931 --> 00:03:18,430

World war ii.

44
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:21,366

- World war ii? - Mm-hm.

45
00:03:21,468 --> 00:03:24,536

We didn't beat the nazis just by talking to 'em.

46
00:03:24,638 --> 00:03:26,305

- We used violence. - Ok, sure.

47
00:03:26,407 --> 00:03:28,240

So, every now and then,

48
00:03:28,342 --> 00:03:31,643

violence is necessary as a last resort,

49
00:03:31,745 --> 00:03:35,647

but for you with your girlfriend's brother,

50
00:03:35,749 --> 00:03:38,483

I mean, would you call that an example of violence working?

51
00:03:38,586 --> 00:03:41,820

Look, I shouldn't have done what I did. I'm not making excuses.

52
00:03:41,922 --> 00:03:45,023

But I don't think you can say that all violence is bad.

53
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:48,493

I mean, I think there's good violence and bad violence.

54
00:03:50,965 --> 00:03:54,333

- What's good violence? - World war ii.

55
00:03:55,369 --> 00:03:57,169

Thanks, vince.

56
00:03:59,306 --> 00:04:02,374

- Um... - Yeah.

57
00:04:02,476 --> 00:04:03,709

Uh, alright, maybe... It's about time.

58
00:04:03,811 --> 00:04:06,878

Maybe we should leave it there.

59
00:04:06,981 --> 00:04:08,947

Thank you, everyone. Thank you.

60
00:04:10,317 --> 00:04:12,351

Alright.

61
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:19,091

The german forces had already moved in

62
00:04:19,193 --> 00:04:22,261

and now occupied the abbey ruins in force.

63
00:04:26,634 --> 00:04:28,500

here you go, mate. You can have the fatty bit.

64
00:04:31,305 --> 00:04:33,805

Mate, you didn't even chew that.

65
00:04:33,907 --> 00:04:35,974

The 28th maori battalion

66
00:04:36,076 --> 00:04:38,810

had led a successful attack on the cassino railway station,

67
00:04:38,912 --> 00:04:41,813

only to then become trapped

68
00:04:41,915 --> 00:04:43,882

and cut off from their support across the river.

69
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:51,123

cheers, love.

70
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:03,201

- hey. - How you doin'?

71
00:05:03,304 --> 00:05:05,871

Good. What's news?

72
00:05:05,973 --> 00:05:07,239

Not much. What's news with you?

73
00:05:09,209 --> 00:05:11,209

Nothing. You ok?

74
00:05:11,312 --> 00:05:12,711

Yeah.

75
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:15,447

Ok.

76
00:05:15,549 --> 00:05:19,818

* you're a naughty, naughty girl and I love it... *

77
00:06:59,937 --> 00:07:01,536

hello.

78
00:07:01,638 --> 00:07:03,705

Ray, it's vinnie.

79
00:07:03,807 --> 00:07:06,875

How you goin', mate?

80
00:07:06,977 --> 00:07:08,376

I'm good, my friend. How are you?

81
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:10,946

Yeah, good, mate. What's news?

82
00:07:11,048 --> 00:07:12,614

Oh, you know, same old shit in here, mate.

83
00:07:12,716 --> 00:07:14,216

Listen, I thought I'd check in

84
00:07:14,318 --> 00:07:17,352

and see if you want to catch up for a beer sometime.

85
00:07:17,454 --> 00:07:19,287

Yeah, sounds good, mate.

86
00:07:19,389 --> 00:07:20,856

Yeah.

87
00:07:20,958 --> 00:07:23,458

I'm pretty...Pretty busy this week.

88
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:26,128

Um, what about next weekend?

89
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:28,029

Sure, weekend. Oh, fuck. No, no, no, no.

90
00:07:28,132 --> 00:07:30,632

Fuck. No, I gotta go see my folks.

91
00:07:30,734 --> 00:07:32,400

Got a farm up there in dorrigo,

92
00:07:32,503 --> 00:07:34,603

so, yeah, I'll be away all weekend.

93
00:07:34,705 --> 00:07:37,606

Ok. What about the weekend after that, then?

94
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:39,774

Weekend after. Sounds great. Let's shoot for that, eh?

95
00:07:39,877 --> 00:07:41,877

Yeah, mate. I'll keep it free.

96
00:07:41,979 --> 00:07:43,778

Alright, you take care of yourself, brother.

97
00:07:43,881 --> 00:07:45,113

- Same, mate. Talk to you soon. - Alright, mate.

98
00:07:45,215 --> 00:07:47,682

See you, mate.

99
00:08:15,379 --> 00:08:17,445

you just gonna leave that there, are you, love?

100
00:08:17,548 --> 00:08:20,081

- Excuse me? - Your dog just took a shit.

101
00:08:20,184 --> 00:08:22,684

- Are you gonna clean it up? - So?

102
00:08:22,786 --> 00:08:24,753

Just gonna leave it for somebody else to stand in, are you?

103
00:08:24,855 --> 00:08:27,756

Well, if it bothers you so much, why don't you pick it up?

104
00:08:27,858 --> 00:08:28,890

Why don't you fuckin' pick it up?

105
00:08:31,528 --> 00:08:32,894

Oh, ok. Yeah.

106
00:08:43,674 --> 00:08:46,174

Nah, it's been good.

107
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:48,009

I mean, it's still early days.

108
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:51,580

But, fuck, last night we're lying in bed

109
00:08:51,682 --> 00:08:53,181

and she says to me,

110
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:56,084

"who have you had the best sex of your life with?"

111
00:08:56,186 --> 00:08:59,521

and I'm lying there thinking, "fuck, how do I answer this?"

112
00:08:59,623 --> 00:09:03,024

you know, because she's not the bird

113
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:04,693

I've had the hottest sex with.

114
00:09:04,795 --> 00:09:08,363

But I can't tell her the best sex I ever had

115
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:11,433

was with some 52-year-old hooker in an alley, you know?

116
00:09:11,535 --> 00:09:15,237

So, I have to say something and fast,

117
00:09:15,339 --> 00:09:19,074

so I say, "you!"

118
00:09:19,176 --> 00:09:21,142

but because I took a second to answer,

119
00:09:21,245 --> 00:09:23,144

she's like, "why did you have to think about it?"

120
00:09:23,213 --> 00:09:25,780

I said, "I don't know.

121
00:09:25,882 --> 00:09:27,749

"the question kind of took me by surprise."

122
00:09:29,853 --> 00:09:32,587

I tell you, mate,

123
00:09:32,689 --> 00:09:35,590

women can ask questions that scare the shit out of you.

124
00:09:35,692 --> 00:09:37,626

Hmm. Hmm. True.

125
00:09:42,699 --> 00:09:45,100

- So, who is this dude, anyway? - Who?

126
00:09:45,202 --> 00:09:47,969

- This guy? - Oh, simon gillespie.

127
00:09:48,071 --> 00:09:50,305

- You know the gillespies? - The mining family?

128
00:09:50,407 --> 00:09:52,173

- Yeah. - Oh, ok.

129
00:09:52,276 --> 00:09:54,409

And what's his problem?

130
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:57,012

He's been having some lady trouble.

131
00:09:57,114 --> 00:09:58,847

Oh, ok.

132
00:09:58,949 --> 00:10:01,416

hey. Uh, simon's here.

133
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:03,251

- Do you want to see him now? - Yeah, yeah. Bring him in.

134
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:04,919

- Thanks, mandy. - You're good.

135
00:10:05,022 --> 00:10:07,756

Oh. Thanks, mandy.

136
00:10:07,858 --> 00:10:09,357

- G'day, mate. - Hey, freddy.

137
00:10:09,459 --> 00:10:11,526

- well, there's a familiar face. - Good to see you.

138
00:10:11,628 --> 00:10:13,428

Good to see you too.

139
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:14,596

- It's been way too long. - Yes.

140
00:10:14,698 --> 00:10:17,265

Uh, simon, this is ray.
