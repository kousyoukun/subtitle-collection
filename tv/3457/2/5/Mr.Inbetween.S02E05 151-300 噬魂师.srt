00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:32,860

-You don't know. -Hey, brit! Brit! Shh.

00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:01,360

-Come on. -Ally: Yeah, ok.

00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:18,340

15
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,450

She's beautiful!

16
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:35,620

Look at these colours in her mane. They're amazing.

17
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:37,890

Dad, come on!

18
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:41,630

-Are you gonna come over? -Nah, mate. You go.

19
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:46,600

-She's so soft. -Yeah.

20
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:52,970

Can we take her home?

21
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:54,840

I don't think she'll fit in the car, love.

22
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:05,120

23
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,700

Dad, look! It's unicorn poo.

Yeah, I know. But we'll come back another day, alright?

28
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:33,710

Brittany: Ok.

29
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,280

'bye.

30
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:39,120

I will never forget you.

31
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,620

Let's go, eh?

32
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:46,630

-Look! -Ally: Oh, that's cool.

33
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:48,460

-Bruce: Wow. -Beauty.

34
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,500

-Here, you want a hand? -Yeah.

35
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,670

-Just watch that branch. -I'm right, thanks.

36
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:58,910

-Ally: Yeah, yeah. You got it? -Yeah.

37
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,930

hey.

38
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:30,670

Hey.  good girl.

39
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:32,170

Good girl.

40
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,470

Yeah, good girl, good girl.

41
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,110

Try and get this horn off, eh?

42
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:38,850

- -hey?

43
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:41,180

There you go. There you go.

44
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:46,320

45
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:04,500

-how you going? -Can we have a word outside?

46
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:06,110

Sure.

47
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,120

what's up?

48
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,280

Brit said you had the sex talk with her.

49
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,520

Yep.

50
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,220

Look, I'm not having a go at you,

51
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,690

but don't you think it's important that

52
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:24,730

if you're gonna have those kind of conversations with her,

53
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:26,360

you at least flag it with me first?

54
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,230

Well, I couldn't flag it with you

55
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:30,430

'cause she caught us having sex.

56
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:31,600

Oh.

57
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,430

Where were you having sex?

58
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,840

-Does it matter? -No, just...

59
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:39,340

What, you think we're having sex in front of her or something?

60
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:41,210

-No, I just... It's just... -

61
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:42,540

brittany: Hi.

62
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:44,950

-Hello! -Are we going bowling?

63
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:48,150

"are we going bowling?" uh, I don't know.

64
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:50,150

I don't know if I'm allowed to take you bowling.

65
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:52,690

-You better ask your mum. -Mum, can we go bowling?

66
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:54,420

Course you can go bowling, sweetie.

67
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:56,120

-Cool. -Awesome.

68
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:05,430

nice, nice!

69
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,630

Brittany: Oh, no!

70
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,270

It's all gone pear-shaped.

71
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:11,100

-I'm gonna win still! -No, you're not.

72
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:12,940

-Yes, I am! -Nah, I'm gonna kill you now.

73
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:16,080

-No, I'm gonna win. -No, I'm gonna focus now.

74
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:25,520

No!

75
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,720

Now you have...40 points?!

76
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,720

40! I'm catching up.

77
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:47,270

I spent an hour this morning going from place to place

78
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,180

just trying to find a normal breakfast.

79
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:52,550

What happened to bacon and eggs on toast?

80
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:54,050

Mmm.

81
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:58,750

Now it's all fuckin' smashed avo on a brioche of quail eggs

82
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:02,820

served up by some bloody weekend pilates instructor

83
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:04,560

man-bun poonce named tristan

84
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,560

who wants to give you a lecture about fuckin' gluten-free.

85
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,430

I gave up in the end.

86
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,730

Are you living in bondi now, eh?

87
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:15,540

No, I just brought maddy over to the beach. I'm in maroubra.

88
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:18,410

On your own?

89
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,410

Me and zoe split up.

90
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:22,940

When did this happen?

91
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:25,350

Early March.

92
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:27,010

Thanks for telling me.

93
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:30,080

You don't wanna hear about that shit, mate.

94
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,320

So, you working?

95
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:38,630

How come?

96
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:40,260

What am I gonna do?

97
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:42,830

You gotta do something, mate.

98
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:44,830

Can I have a drink, dad?

99
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:47,130

Sure, mads. What do you want?

100
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,740

-Lemonade. -Lemonade?

101
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:50,170

What do you say?

102
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:52,370

Please?

103
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:56,980

"please, dad, 'cause you are the best dad in the universe"?

104
00:06:56,980 --> 00:07:00,680

Please, dad, because you are the best dad in the universe.

105
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,820

Well trained. Well done. Mmm.

106
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:05,920

Brittany! Other way!

107
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:34,880

-what? -What's that smell?

108
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,320

-What smell? -The cigarette smell.

109
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,990

Dunno. Must be one of the neighbours.

110
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:42,260

Mum says you smoke.

111
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:43,760

Yeah, I used to smoke.

112
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,360

But not anymore?

113
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,730

Mm-mm.

114
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,660

Pinky swear?

115
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:52,800

I'm not gonna pinky swear.

116
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,840

Look, I... You know...

117
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:58,340

I have one occasionally, alright?

118
00:07:58,340 --> 00:07:59,510

Why did you lie?

119
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:01,480

'cause I don't want you knowing that I smoke.

120
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,810

Why?

121
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:05,550

I don't want you thinking it's ok and then one day you start.

122
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:07,050

No way. Smoking's bad for you.

123
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:08,880

It gives you cancer. I'm not stupid.

124
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,020

Yeah, well, I didn't say you were stupid.

125
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:12,950

Well, I don't want you to get cancer.

126
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,620

Well, I don't wanna get cancer either.

127
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:15,960

Why don't you stop, then?

128
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,890

'cause it's not bloody easy to quit, it's...

129
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:19,990

..Addictive.

130
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000

Why?

131
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,760

Well, there's this stuff called nicotine.

132
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:26,270

That's a chemical, alright?

133
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:28,170

And that's in the cigarettes, right?

134
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:31,400

So when you smoke it, you get used to getting that nicotine.

135
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:33,610

So when you stop, the receptors in your brain

136
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:36,480

don't get the nicotine anymore and they start screaming out

137
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,040

and it makes you go crazy.

138
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:41,080

Well, will you stop for me, please?

139
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,320

Alright.

140
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,720

-Promise? -Look...

141
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:53,290

I promise you I'll try to quit, ok?

142
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,300

I can't guarantee you 100% that I can do it,

143
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:56,800

but I'll try, ok?

144
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,000

Well, you need to try really, really hard.

145
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,370

Ok. I promise I'll try really hard, ok?

146
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:05,140

-Ok. -Alright.

147
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:07,010

Happy now?

148
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:09,210

-Yes. -Good.

149
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:12,350

-Cleaned your room up? -No. It's christmas.

150
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:13,850

You don't clean your room up,

151
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:15,350

santa won't give you any presents.

152
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:16,850

You told me santa's not real.

153
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:18,450

Yeah, well, I won't give you any presents

154
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:20,450

if you don't clean your bloody room - how's that?

155
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:23,560

- fine. -Mm-hm. Bye-bye.

156
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,800

Bruce: Nah, not that one.

157
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:32,400

Yeah.

158
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:38,040

-Who's that from, brit? -From uncle bruce.

159
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,940

Ah, ok.

160
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:46,810

Oh, cool! Thanks.

161
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,420

Is it alright?

162
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,150

Yeah, it's great.

163
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:54,050

Bruce: You're welcome, beautiful.

164
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:56,720

Do you want your present now?

165
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:58,760

-You got me a present? -Mm-hm.

166
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,260

Sure!

167
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:07,430

-Are you ready? -Yeah.

168
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,040

Tell uncle bruce what your present is, brit.

169
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,940

Oh, um, I wrote you some jokes.

170
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:13,470

-You wrote some jokes? -Mm-hm.

171
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,440

Tell him what you wanna be when you grow up.

172
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,940

A stand-up comedian.

173
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,350

A stand-up comedian? Wow!

174
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:20,850

When did this happen?

175
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:23,250

Oh, this is just what she wants to be this week, mate.

176
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:24,820

It'll change next week.

177
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:27,320

-Bruce: Alright. -Go for it, brit.

178
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,320

What's brown and sticky?

179
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,560

I don't know. What?

180
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,860

A stick.

181
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:36,000

Oh!  oh, very good.

182
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000

Why did the chicken cross the road?

183
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,670

I don't know. Why did the chicken cross the road?

184
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:43,140

Why are you asking me? I asked you.

185
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,340

Bruce: Eh?

186
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:49,040

-Don't look at me, mate. -

187
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,780

very good.

188
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:52,550

-Knock, knock. -Who's there?

189
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:54,350

Interrupting cow.

190
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:56,280

-Interrup... -Moo!

191
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:59,820

Ohh! You got me. Very good.

192
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:02,190

Very good! Bravo.

193
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:04,790

Thank you, beautiful.

194
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:10,300

-What'd you get me, mate? -You?

195
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:15,140

Oh...Here we go.

196
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,440

-Oh, you got me one of those. -Yeah.

197
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:22,010

Oh, ok. I got you the same thing but I got you two of 'em.

198
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:24,980

-Oh, thank you! -

199
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:29,020

-bruce: Is that for ally? -Yeah.

200
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:30,780

Yeah? What did you get her?

201
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:32,490

I made her a necklace.

202
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:34,550

-You made it? -Yeah.

203
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,320

She'll love that!

204
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:39,030

-Alright. Got all your stuff? -Mm-hm.

205
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:41,590

Alright, mate. Sure you don't wanna come?

206
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,800

Nah, mate, I'm good.

207
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,870

-What are you gonna do? -I'm gonna take it easy.

208
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,370

-Alright. Come on, buggerlugs. -'bye!

209
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:51,870

You look beautiful!

210
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:53,370

-Brittany: Thanks. -Thanks, mate.

211
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,380

-Bruce: Not you! -Oh.

212
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:58,140

-Bruce: Merry christmas! -Brittany: Merry christmas.

213
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:00,250

Merry christmas, mate. See you in a bit.

214
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:02,020

Bruce: Yeah.

215
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:10,670

32.

216
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:13,240

Ah!

217
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:18,080

218
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:20,850

- -nice house, eh?

219
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:25,920

Hi! Merry christmas!

220
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,860

Hi, darling. Ohh!

221
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:29,930

Oh, you didn't have to do that! Thank you!

222
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:31,530

Come in, come in, come in!

223
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:34,430

-Merry christmas. -Merry christmas.

224
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:40,840

So what... Oh, here we go.

225
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:43,640

-What's your mum's name again? -Ally: Sally.

226
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:46,010

-Sally: Hello! -Brittany: Hi!

227
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:47,940

-Merry christmas! -Mum, this is brittany.

228
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:49,510

-This is ray. -How you doing?

229
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:51,780

-How you doing, ray? -Ally: Oh, here, hang on.

230
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:54,180

-Merry christmas. Welcome. -Merry christmas to you too.

231
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:57,290

-Nice house. -Oh! Thank you very much.

232
00:12:57,290 --> 00:12:58,790

Did you want a sparkling apple juice?

233
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:00,120

-Yes, please. -Yes?

234
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:01,620

-And can I open this now? -Yes.

235
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:04,530

-Would you like a beer, wine? -Yeah, that'd be great, yeah.

236
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:06,700

-Come on outside. -Ok. Cool.

237
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:08,230

Sally: This is where it's all happening.

238
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:09,870

Man: So, "what do you get

239
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:13,200

"if you cross a skeleton with a famous detective?"

240
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:14,700

man: What, dad?

241
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,340

"sherlock bones."

242
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:19,440

-woman: Oh, come on! -

243
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,710

-I like the sausage one better. -Man: Here you go, mum.

244
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:23,780

-Dad's jokes are awesome. -Thanks, love.

245
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,720

-genius. He's a genius. -That is a cracker.

246
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,290

Are you ok?

247
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:31,490

I need a smoke.

248
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:32,990

Well, go have one.

249
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:34,860

I can't. I promised brit I'd give up.

250
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,290

On christmas day?

251
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,760

-Jesus h. -Mmm.

252
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:43,770

-Ok. Good. -Dad: Hey, ray!

253
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:45,400

Ever played secret santa before?

254
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,440

Nah, mate.

255
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:50,440

Oh, mate, you are in for the time of your life!

256
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,810

Ok, the way it works, there's 12 of us in here.

257
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:55,980

There's all little cards in here with numbers on. 1-12.

258
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:57,510

Everybody takes a number.

259
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,480

Come on, troy! Come on in, mate.

260
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,980

You grab a number there.

261
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:03,220

Ok, now, what's gonna happen is that whoever draws number 1,

262
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,950

they get to go up there first.

263
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,790

-There you go, t-roy. -Thanks, boss.

264
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:08,260

Number 2, they follow them up

265
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:10,060

and get to pick a present as well.

266
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:11,560

Now, here's where it gets interesting.

267
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,630

If they don't like their present

268
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:16,130

they can swap it with number 1.

269
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:19,270

Which means number 12 is the best place to be, ok?

270
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:22,070

Because you get to pick from all the other presents at the end.

271
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:23,970

And here's me - I got number 4.

272
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:26,010

-Who's number 1? -Oh, that's me. Again.

273
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:27,510

Same as last year!

274
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:29,950

Every year! Loser!

275
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:31,410

oh, dad!

276
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:34,050

Ok. Can I check what they all...All are?

277
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:35,920

Woman: Don't shake too hard. Some are breakable.

278
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:39,220

alright, I'll go for the hidden one.

279
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:41,690

-Dad: A fishbowl for sure! -I'm guessing a book.

280
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:44,830

What do we got? We've got...

281
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:48,030

Oh! 'how to insult people in 50 languages'.

282
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:50,300

-How useful! -That's perfect for you, love.

283
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:51,870

You already know how to do that!

Come on up here, son.

Well, dad, those... Those do look good.

Man: He's going for the headphones!

315
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,860

But I think I like what's in the box.

316
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:20,690

-Oh, you're not! -Woman: Trent!

317
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:22,690

-Come on! -Trent. Really?

318
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:25,290

-What? Hey, it's the rules. -She's just a kid.

319
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,870

Man: What are you gonna do with a unicorn?

320
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:34,370

-I don't know yet. -Dad: Alright, everybody.

321
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:37,370

Let's...Let's clean the place up,

322
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:38,840

pick up all the papers,

323
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,280

then we'll go have a drink outside - what do you say?

324
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:43,710

Woman: Merry christmas! Grab a bag.

325
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,680

Robby, are you chewing yours?

326
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:58,330

-how's it going, dude? -Yeah, good.

327
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:00,300

Smoke?

328
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:01,800

Nah, I gave up.

329
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,300

-Yeah, I should. -Yeah, you should.

330
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:08,140

Hey, you know that... That unicorn candle?

331
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:09,810

Yeah, it's pretty cool, isn't it?

332
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:13,310

Yeah. Yeah. Is there any chance you can give it back?

333
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:15,380

Why?

334
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:17,180

Well, my daughter,

335
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:20,150

she's kind of obsessed with unicorns at the moment.

336
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:22,690

-Yeah. -And, uh...

337
00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:25,320

I was hoping maybe, you know, you'd give it back

338
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,090

and, you know, I'll...

339
00:17:27,090 --> 00:17:29,090

..Throw you a hundred bucks or something.

340
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:30,590

You trying to bribe me

341
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,100

to give your daughter the unicorn candle?

342
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,600

I wouldn't say I'm bribing you.

343
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,330

More like I'm...

344
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:37,300

..Asking you a favour, you know?

345
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,000

And if you can do it,

346
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,610

I'll show a bit of gratitude and throw you some cash.

347
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:44,240

Do I look like I need the money?

348
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:48,180

I don't think you look like you need the money.

349
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:50,750

You know how much I make in a year?

350
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,250

Why are you being a dickhead?

351
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:55,280

yeah, I think one of us is being a dickhead.

352
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:09,830

Why the fuck would you take a present off a little kid?

353
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:11,470

You're a grown man.

354
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:14,900

What the fuck do you want with a fuckin' girly candle?

355
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:17,210

'cause it's kitschy.

356
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:19,480

It's kitschy?

357
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,240

Yeah. Kitschy.

358
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:22,750

Hey, dad. What happened with ally's brother?

367
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:51,890

I think he tripped over.

368
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:54,560

He had a bit much to drink.

No, you keep it.

I'm not making excuses, but...

383
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,870

..Brit caught me smoking this morning

384
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:48,510

and, um, she made me promise to give up

385
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:50,280

and I hadn't smoked all day and...

386
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:52,880

You know.

387
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,010

Fair enough.

388
00:20:57,850 --> 00:20:59,520

You're ok?

389
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:03,490

-No. -Yeah.

390
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:07,330

Fair enough.

391
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:09,160

What about your bro?

392
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,860

He alright?

393
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:13,070

How do you think?

394
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:16,600

Mmm.

395
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:32,820

So you know that guy that I was engaged to, yeah?

396
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:34,950

I ended that.

397
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:38,090

We were together for...

398
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:40,160

..I don't know, three years.

399
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,970

He had demons like you.

400
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:50,600

He used to lash out and smash things

401
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:52,510

and punch walls.

402
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:55,980

And then one day he started on me.

403
00:21:57,410 --> 00:22:00,410

He apologised and told me that he loved me and...

404
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,020

..I forgave him.

405
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:09,260

And then a few weeks later, he, um...

406
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:10,760

..Slapped me.

407
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:13,490

After that, he kicked me, punched me.

408
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:17,600

And every time, you know, he'd say...

409
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:19,800

.."I'm sorry."

410
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:22,840

and told me that he loved me.

411
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:25,570

So...

412
00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:29,740

And he's not a bad person.

413
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:31,580

I used to tell myself that all the time.

414
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:33,680

He's just... He's damaged and...

415
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:37,580

I thought that I could save him.

416
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:40,790

and I tried, I really...

417
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:42,320

I really tried.

418
00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:45,620

But I couldn't.

419
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:58,870

there's a darkness in you.

420
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:02,410

And I think that's one of the things

421
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:04,240

that attracted me to you in the first place.

422
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:06,210

But now I think...

423
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:08,350

I don't know. I think that...

424
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:13,650

..The very thing I loved about you, now it scares me.

425
00:23:22,930 --> 00:23:24,730

I'd never hit you.

426
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:28,200

That's what he used to say.

427
00:23:30,770 --> 00:23:32,710

And I can't take that chance.

428
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:35,410

-Mmm. -I can't. I'm sorry.

429
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:45,220

So that's it?

430
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,090

Yeah.

431
00:23:57,870 --> 00:23:59,300

I'm sorry.

432
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:02,300

So am I.

433
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:07,710

I love you.

434
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:10,440

I do. Know that.

435
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:15,250

And walking away from someone that you love

436
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:18,050

is one of the hardest fucking things in the world to do.

437
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,720

Yeah.

438
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,730

Well...

439
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:41,440

yeah.

440
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,540
