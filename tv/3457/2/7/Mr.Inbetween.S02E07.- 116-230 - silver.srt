
116
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,240
你说的工作是指什么
When you say 'job', what do you mean?

117
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:41,570
- 你口中的工作是什么意思  - 你第一份
-What do you mean, 'job'? -Well, your first...

118
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:42,840
我说不好  打手吧  我是说
I don't know, hit. I mean...

119
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:45,340
谁告诉你我做打手的
Who told you I do hits?

120
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,680
弗雷迪跟我说的  说你
Well, that's what freddy told me, that you'd...

121
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:50,180
稍微聊了聊
..Talk about that a little bit.

122
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:54,550
抱歉  我可能会错意了
I mean, sorry, I might have misunderstood that.

123
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:57,150
我都没意识到  就是弗雷迪说的 
I didn't realise that... That's just what freddy said.

124
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:05,430
所以我才把你叫来
and that's kinda why I got you here,

125
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:07,800
因为我就想在书中写这种事
'cause that's the sort of stuff I wanna talk about in the book.

126
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,850

'moist'.

127
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:24,850

Ray: Yeah, that's a good one.

128
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:26,420

Moist.

129
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,420

-Mmm. -That's a good one.

130
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,750

Yeah. My grandmother, when I was a kid,

131
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:32,920

she used to make this teacake,

132
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:34,590

and that was really moist.

133
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,930

she used to put cinnamon on the top of it.

134
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:40,530

-Mmm? -Yeah. Lovely. Lovely.

135
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:42,930

Ok. Teacake.

136
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,530

-Teacake. -Right.

137
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,770

'appendectomy'.

138
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:49,940

-'appendectomy'? -Yeah.

139
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,110

Appendectomy. Appendectomy. What's that?

140
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:54,110

You don't know what appendectomy is?

141
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:55,180

No.

142
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,550

It's where they take your bloody appendix out.

143
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:57,780

Take your appendix out. No, I knew that.

144
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:00,280

Yeah, sure you did. Yeah.

145
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:02,750

'panties'.

146
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:06,390

'panties'?

147
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:08,790

Not when you say it. Like, when a chick says it.

148
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:10,560

When she says, like, "oh, take off my panties!"

149
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:17,300

that's a good word. Moist panties.

150
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,300

-Moist panties? -Yeah.

151
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,300

You've outdone yourself, haven't you?

152
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:22,310

Thank you very much.

153
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:24,310

Put two of your favourite words together in a sentence.

154
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:25,380

-Yeah, well, you know... -Very good.

155
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,310

-Quite the wordsmith. -Yeah. Yeah, you are.

156
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:29,180

-What do you reckon? -Yeah, nah. I like it.

157
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:49,870

Feel that.

158
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,470

Shit. Sharp!

159
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:57,010

Mmm.

160
00:09:57,110 --> 00:10:00,010

Gary: And it was good calamari, mate.

161
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:02,780

Like, fresh. Fresh as. Not the frozen shit.

162
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,850

You know, the shit you get from the fishmongers.

163
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:08,350

But what happened was is that when I put it in the fridge,

164
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:09,790

I've left it in the bag that I've bought it in.

165
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:11,620

Yeah.

166
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,290

So when I've gone to cook it,

167
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:16,960

it's been in there for a couple of days

168
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:18,190

and I've taken it out.

169
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,300

-Fuck it stunk. -Yeah.

170
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,630

Just rank.

171
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:24,700

It's just gone all through the house.

172
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,040

What I shoulda done, when I bought it,

173
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:29,270

if I was gonna leave it in there for a couple of days,

174
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:32,110

I should have tipped it out, washed it thoroughly,

175
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:35,280

put it in a fresh plastic bag, a new plastic bag,

176
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:38,550

then whacked it in the fridge and then, you know,

177
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:40,220

probably would have had a chance

178
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,950

at lasting a couple more days, you know?

179
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:44,890

But it stewed in its own juices

180
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:47,960

and its own filth, you know?

181
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:50,360

So...So it went off and I had to chuck it out,

182
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:53,030

and it was, like, a kilo of the shit which, you know, bummed me.

183
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:54,130

Ray: Mmm.

184
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:56,400

But what really bummed me

185
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:59,440

is I was watching one of those nature docos

186
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:02,440

and they had a bit on octopuses

187
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:04,970

and, like, their life cycle and shit.

188
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,640

And I didn't know this, but...

189
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,080

Do you know how octopuses have babies?

190
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:11,780

Mm-mm.

191
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:16,590

The female octopus

192
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:17,750

gets pregnant, right?

193
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:19,760

Obviously.

194
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:23,990

And she lays eggs underneath a rock, right?

195
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,060

And then she guards it.

196
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,570

Doesn't eat, doesn't sleep,

197
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:33,240

and just moves her tentacles over the eggs.

198
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:34,740

Ray: Mmm.

199
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:37,670

For months and months and months, right?

200
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:41,910

And just as the eggs hatch,

201
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:43,050

you know what happens?

202
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,150

She dies?

203
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,090

-She dies. -Mmm.

204
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:52,790

Mmm.

205
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:56,660

So I won't be eating calamari anymore.

206
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,900

Ray: Mmm.

207
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:06,700

Calamari's squid, isn't it?

208
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:08,170

What?

209
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,840

No.

210
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:14,240

-Yeah. -Hold on.

211
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:17,350

Yeah, calamari's squid, mate, not octopus.

212
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:21,280

So I can eat calamari?

213
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:22,520

Go for it.

214
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:27,420

Huh!

215
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:30,230

Gary: Alright, then.

216
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:33,360

How many steel-framed buildings in history

217
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:35,770

have collapsed due to fire?

218
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:40,840

-I don't know. -Three, all on 9/11.

219
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:45,210

-Two. -No, three.

220
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:47,480

You got the twin towers,

221
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:50,110

and there was a third building.

222
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:52,950

Two were hit by a plane, one wasn't hit by a plane.

223
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:56,220

That's building 7, a couple of hundred metres down the road.

224
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,890

And that fell a few hours later in under five seconds.

225
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:01,160

And they say it collapsed

226
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:04,560

because it got hit from debris from the twin towers

227
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:06,500

and then it started a fire

228
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,660

and that's what caused it to fall.

229
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:09,670

But controlled demolition experts

230
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:10,800

say it was a controlled demolition.
