1
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:43,570

How's it look?

2
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:45,010

Eh.

3
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:47,410

Cameras everywhere.

4
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:49,050

Yeah, right.

5
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,680

Big gates.

6
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,450

Not good.

7
00:00:58,220 --> 00:00:59,820

: Oh...

8
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:05,660

Ah, well, we've got plenty of pistachios.

9
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:13,800

-RAY: Connery. Yeah. -GARY: Yeah. Totally.

10
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,340

Second?

11
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:19,240

Lazenby.

12
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,910

-Lazenby? -Yeah.

13
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:23,950

Who the fuck's that?

14
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:25,650

George Lazenby.

15
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,020

No, never heard of him.

16
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:30,160

After Connery.

17
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:31,620

He did, um,

18
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:33,660

Her Majesty's, uh, Secret Service.

19
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:35,260

-Mm-hmm? -Only did one film.

20
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:37,260

Never seen it. I'll have to see it.

21
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:38,760

Yeah, it's good. Yeah, right.

22
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,230

He's an Aussie.

23
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:41,770

-An Aussie? -Mm-hmm.

24
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,570

-Bond? -Aussie Bond, mate.

25
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,940

-Fuck off. -Yeah, serious.

26
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:46,440

That's not right-- you can't have an Aussie Bond.

27
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:47,740

No, he's Aussie.

28
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:48,970

-Really? -Yeah.

29
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:51,080

-Yeah, right. -Mm-hmm.

30
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:53,280

-Okay. So that's two. -Yeah.

31
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:55,250

What about number three?

32
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,320

I don't mind the guy playing him now.

33
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:59,120

Mm-hmm. What's his name?

34
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:04,050

What's his fucking name?

35
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,690

Yeah, I don't know.

36
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:10,260

Yeah.

37
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,930

-He's number three, though. -Yeah, he's three.

38
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,430

Right-o. Number four?

39
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:15,370

Four...

40
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,200

I didn't like Moore.

41
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,470

-Don't like the old Roger? -No.

42
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,470

-Nah? -Nah, too snobby,

43
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:22,640

-Really? -polished, yeah.

44
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:24,110

-Yeah? -I didn't like him.

45
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:25,980

I like the old Roger.

46
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:28,280

-Yeah, no, I didn't like him. -Okay.

47
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:29,880

What about Brosnan?

48
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:31,680

No.

49
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,820

No, I put Brosnan last.

50
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:33,980

-Don't like Brosnan? -Last.

51
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:34,990

-Really? -Yeah.

52
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:36,650

Yeah, all right.

53
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:37,790

Yeah, no, I'd go:

54
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:39,490

Connery, Lazenby,

55
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,130

guy playing him now...

56
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,190

-Mm-hmm. -um, Dalton,

57
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:45,330

Moore...

58
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,660

-Brosnan. -All right.

59
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:49,830

I got: Connery...

60
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,700

Moore, Brosnan,

61
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:54,040

-guy playing him now... -Mm-hmm.

62
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:56,070

-Dalton. -Don't like him.

63
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:01,550

All right.

64
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:04,010

Best Batman.

65
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:05,350

Oh.

66
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:07,180

-Keaton. -Keaton. Yeah.

67
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:11,020

: "I'm Batman."

68
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,960

H... Here we are.

69
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:59,200

GARY : Okay.

70
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,240

Pull in there.

71
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,760

GARY: Which one's the prez?

72
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:21,260

RAY: Guy in the light-colored jacket.

73
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:24,930

And the VP?

74
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,130

That guy he's hugging now-- the bald head.

75
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:30,270

GARY: Yeah, right.

76
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:34,670

It's fucking Daniel Craig.

77
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:37,610

RAY: Ah. That's it.

78
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,380

Ugh.

79
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,690

Put the thingy on! Put the...

80
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,850

Aah!

81
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:51,690

Aah!

82
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,190

Go left!

83
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:56,360

- -RAY: Yeah!

84
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:57,860

BRITTANY: Oh!

85
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,300

ALLY:  All right, last one.

86
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:03,600

You need to get this one.

87
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:04,600

-Yeah? -Last one.

88
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,640

-All right. -Ready?

89
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:07,300

Start praying.

90
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,880

He's good.

91
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:14,610

What do you want?

92
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:16,550

-Uh, that one, please. -No worries.

93
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,780

-There you go. -

94
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,820

-Happy? -Yeah.

95
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:28,960

ALLY: What are we doing for Christmas?

96
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:31,000

RAY: What do you want to do?

97
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:32,860

ALLY: Well, my family

98
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:36,300

are going to my folks for lunch...

99
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:37,740

-Yeah. -and I was wondering

100
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:40,510

if you and Bruce and Britt...

101
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,570

wanted to come.

102
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:44,580

Yeah, I'll ask Brucey.

103
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:47,610

But Britt and I will definitely come.

104
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:51,120

Okay.

105
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,250

-Girls, you want an ice cream? -Yeah! -Yeah!

106
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,990

-ALLY: Yes. -RAY: Yeah, that's a surprise.

107
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:58,420

-MAN: Let me get a scoop of chocolate. -SERVER: Right.

108
00:05:58,460 --> 00:05:59,760

MAN: Two scoops. Why not? Fill it up.

109
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:00,930

-WOMAN: Two? -MAN: Yeah.

110
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,090

SERVER: And there you go.

111
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,660

Thank you.

112
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,830

-Uh, excuse me? -Yeah?

113
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:10,330

I asked for two scoops.

114
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,940

Oh, yeah, there's two scoops there.

115
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:14,040

How come they're the same size, then?

116
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:15,510

-See? -

117
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:17,270

Well, there's one scoop in this cup, right?

118
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:19,040

-Yeah. -And two scoops in this cup?

119
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,910

-Yeah. -So how come they're the same size, then?

120
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:23,680

-Oh. No, sorry, I... -There-There's as much in this one as this one.

121
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:25,620

Right, I pushed the two scoops down more

122
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:28,550

so that they'd both fit into the cup.

123
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:30,620

-Just don't worry about it. -What? It's a fucking rip-off.

124
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:32,120

I put the same-size scoops in there.

125
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,690

You put the same-size scoops in there?

126
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:36,260

-Yes. -I don't fucking think so, mate.

127
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:38,030

-Look. -

128
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:40,100

Scoops. Same height.

129
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:41,700

SERVER: Mm-hmm.

130
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:43,430

Yeah, um, like I was saying, I pushed it down, so...

131
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:44,700

Two scoops. Yeah, yeah.

132
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:46,540

-One still should be bigger. -Mm-hmm.

133
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:48,240

If you're n... if you're not happy...

134
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:49,610

-Give me two scoops. -Okay.

135
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,240

Fucking wrong with this guy.

136
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,050

-Deaf or something. -I'm really sorry about that.

137
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,450

There's another scoop.

138
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,980

All right, that's better.

139
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,950

You get what I mean, right, about the scoops?

140
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:04,590

Oh, yeah, totally. It's completely fine.

141
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,390

-Yeah, all good. -Mm-hmm.

142
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:08,530

All right, let's go.

143
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:13,260

You got a problem, mate?

144
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,730

Yeah, mate. Would you like one, would you?

145
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:17,230

Well, come on.

146
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,570

-Let's go. -ALLY: Ray.

147
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,240

-MAN: Huh? -ALLY: It's not worth it.

148
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:22,770

-Well, come on. -MAN: Eh...

149
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:25,510

Yeah, that's what I thought. Fag.

150
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:29,110

Uh, what do you want, girls?

151
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:31,250

-What flavor? -Eh? What do you want?

152
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,120

-Uh... -I want salted caramel.

153
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:34,950

-Salted caramel? -Yeah.

154
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:36,350

I want mint choc chip.

155
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:38,290

-Mint choc-- that's my favorite. -Yeah.

156
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,190

-How many scoops you want? -Have a good night.

157
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,140

Dad?

158
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:58,680

-Oh. God. Oh! Sorry, it's... -Don't hit Ally!

159
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:00,480

No, darling, it's okay. It's okay. It's, um...

160
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:01,950

-We're okay. We're just... -Why were you hitting her?

161
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:03,680

-No, no, no, no. It's okay. -I... I wasn't hitting.

162
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:05,980

-No... -I wasn't. I wasn't. No, we're just mucking around, love.

163
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,720

-ALLY: Um... -Just-just... just mucking around, just playful.

164
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,190

-And it's all right. -What were you doing?

165
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:12,360

Um...

166
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:14,120

We were having sex.

167
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,430

Oh, Jesus.

168
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:21,070

Um, has Mum had the birds and the bees chat with you, love?

169
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,570

-What? -The sex talk.

170
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,700

-Has Mum talked to you about sex? -No.

171
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:26,370

Okay. Well, we... We'll... we'll...

172
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,010

We'll have a talk about it, okay?

173
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,370

Why don't you just go to your room, and we'll...?

174
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:31,410

I'll come in in a minute, all right?

175
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:34,510

Just give us a minute.

176
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:39,480

- -Ah, man. Mm.

177
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,090

Jesus Christ.

178
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,920

Fucking heart attack.

179
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:45,920

Oh...

180
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:50,930

Okay. So...

181
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:54,900

When a man and a woman love each other,

182
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:57,430

all right, they have sex.

183
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:59,440

Okay?

184
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:00,940

So, um...

185
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:04,010

...when they have sex,

186
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:07,280

the man puts his penis...

187
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:09,010

-You know what a penis is? -Dad.

188
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:10,450

Okay.

189
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,620

So, the man takes his penis,

190
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:14,180

and he puts it

191
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,720

inside the woman's vagina.

192
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,860

What? Why?

193
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:21,360

Well, 'cause that's how you make a baby.

194
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:24,430

So, do you know what, um...

195
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:26,400

do you know what testicles are?

196
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:28,530

-Balls? -ALLY: Mm.

197
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:31,770

Balls, yeah. Okay. So, in the man's balls,

198
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,970

there's things called sperm.

199
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,570

-Okay? -Okay.

200
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:38,640

And they're kind of like, um, like little fish.

201
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,610

-Fish? -Mm. -ALLY: No.

202
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:42,210

Nah, they're more like, um, tadpoles.

203
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:44,750

You've got tadpoles in your balls?

204
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:53,560

They're kind of like tadpoles, but they're smaller.

205
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:55,430

-ALLY: Mm. -Okay?

206
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:59,060

So, anyway, when the man and the woman have sex, right,

207
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:02,570

the sperm-- the little tadpoles--

208
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,470

swim out of the man's penis, right,

209
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:08,640

and go into the woman's vagina.

210
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:12,580

And then they swim

211
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:14,680

up into...

212
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:16,980

the woman's... tummy.

213
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:19,580

Mm. There's an egg. Where there's an egg there.

214
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,620

-An egg? -Yeah. No, it's...

215
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:23,590

it's not a... it's not a hard egg. It's not like...

216
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:25,420

Not like a chicken egg. It's-it's a soft egg.

217
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:26,490

And there's, like,

218
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:29,690

millions of these sperm, okay?

219
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:32,800

So, the sperm that swims the fastest

220
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:34,630

out of all those millions, right,

221
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:36,930

is the first one that gets to the egg,

222
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:39,800

and that's the one that makes the baby.

223
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:43,040

So, when you were a sperm, you swam the fastest.

224
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:45,040

So, if I was the fastest sperm,

225
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,210

how come I'm not a good swimmer now?

226
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:51,350

Um...

227
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:52,720

-Well... -Wait. So, hang on.

228
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,350

I came from your balls?

229
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:58,220

Half of you came from my balls.

230
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:00,020

Half-half of you came from my balls,

231
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:02,030

and the other half came from your mum's tummy.

232
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:04,700

-That's weird. -Mm.

233
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:07,130

So, are you gonna make a sister for me?

234
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,830

Uh, no, we're not planning to. No.

235
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,740

Why are you doing sex, then?

236
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,410

Um... 'cause it feels nice.

237
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:24,050

Gross!

238
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:26,350

ALLY: It's not that bad. It's a bit gross.

239
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,300

* Lights out... *

240
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,910

How you going, love?

241
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,770

G'day. What can I do you for?

242
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:24,570

Just a couple of dimmies. Thanks, love.

243
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:26,610

Okay.

244
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,650

*

245
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,310

So, how's your day going?

246
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:32,080

RAY: It's all right. How's yours?

247
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,780

Oh, you know. Same old, same old.

248
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:36,120

-Yeah. -Boring.

249
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:38,590

There you go. That's $6.80, thanks.

250
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:40,120

Keep the change, love, all right?

251
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,890

Aw, thanks.

252
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:44,590

* Together we'll get through *

253
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:46,830

* I don't have the time... *

254
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:53,640

* I promise, baby, you *

255
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:56,140

* Hold on to me tight *

256
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:58,610

* I'm hanging by your side... *

257
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,980

Here we go.

258
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:01,410

Hey, Steph. How are you, doll?

259
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:02,810

-G'day. Not bad. You? -Good.

260
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:04,250

-Good. -I'm doing good, love.

261
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:07,120

-You want a drink, mate? -Yeah, a lemon i...

262
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:09,090

lemon iced tea, man.

263
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,120

Ray?

264
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:12,760

How are you, mate?

265
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:14,620

I don't believe it.

266
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,260

-Ray Shoesmith. -Yeah.

267
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:17,660

How you been? All right?

268
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:19,260

Jesus. I'm real good, mate.

269
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,830

Geez, it's good to... Oh.

270
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:23,470

-Mate, it's good to see you. -Yeah. Same, Vinnie.

271
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,000

-No, really. Seriously. -Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

272
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,370

-Fucking good to see you. -Yeah, same, mate. Yeah.

273
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,140

What the...? You-you live around here, do you?

274
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:29,810

-Yeah, just about ten minutes down the road. -Nice, nice.

275
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,310

-You around here, too, eh? Yeah, yeah.

276
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:33,510

-Hey, listen, uh, Pauly, mate. -Yeah.

277
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:35,480

Yeah. I was real sorry to hear about Pauly.

278
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:36,550

-Oh, yeah. -I was real sorry to hear

279
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:37,780

-about that, mate. -Yeah. Thanks, mate.

280
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:39,380

Now, I would've come to the funeral, I was overseas.

281
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:41,290

-Yeah, no, it's all right. -He was a good bloke, but...

282
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,990

-Thank you. Yeah. Great bloke. -Yeah, sorry.

283
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:44,820

-Yeah. yeah. -Yeah. Anyway, so what you got there?

284
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:47,160

-What you...? Dimmies. -Dimmies, mate.

285
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:48,560

-Yeah. -Ah, can't go past the dimmies, mate.

286
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:49,830

-Surely can't. -Hey. Hey, listen.

287
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:51,300

Have you tried the sausage rolls?

288
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,530

-Uh, no. No, I haven't. -Oh, fuck. Hey, Steph.

289
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:56,130

Old mate here-- he's never tried one of your sausage rolls.

290
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:57,530

-Coming right up, Vinnie. -I'll pay for it. Yeah?

291
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:58,800

-Yeah. -All right. I...

292
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,400

It might sound like I'm carrying on,

293
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,010

but seriously, she makes them fresh here every day.

294
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,510

They're the best sausage rolls in the country, I swear to God.

295
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:05,310

-Oh, yeah? -Put that down there...

296
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:07,310

-I'll give it a crack, mate. I got to run. -All right.

297
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:09,050

-Yeah, I'm late already. Good to see you. -Ah.

298
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,480

-Real good. Real good. -Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

299
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:12,750

-You look good. -You, too. You haven't aged.

300
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:14,750

-Yeah. Look after yourself. -Well, yeah.

301
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:17,120

-It's real good to see you, mate. -Talk to you soon.

302
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:23,430

Now, some of those numbers aren't gonna add up exactly,

303
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:24,830

-but I think... -Some of 'em?

304
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:26,230

-You know what to do. -Yeah.

305
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:27,660

-Some of 'em. Couple of 'em. -Yeah.

306
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,030

Couple of 'em. Hi, mate.

307
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:30,830

-You all right? -Yeah, good.

308
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,770

-You sticking around for a bit? -Yeah.

309
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,770

I want to talk to you about something, you know.

310
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,710

-All right. -How you doing, man?

311
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:38,180

-Yeah. -Ray.

312
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:40,680

-Nasir. -We got to have a chat, all right?

313
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:42,050

I'll catch you later.

314
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,450

-Is that the guy? -No, mate. Come on.

315
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,850

-Is that the guy? -Let's go.

316
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,380

Answer me!

317
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:50,690

I'm gonna teach you about loss.

318
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,760

Excuse me?

319
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:53,520

-Get to work, please now. -I know your face now.

320
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,160

-Get to work, Ray! -Gonna teach you about loss!

321
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,940

- -Davros' brother, was it?

322
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:12,240

Why the fuck would you bring him in here?

323
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,940

Yeah, I know, I know.

324
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:17,210

Hey, listen, um, that shit he said--

325
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,880

don't worry about that.

326
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:21,590

He's just... he's just upset, you know?

327
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:26,990

Is he a crim?

328
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:28,990

No. No, he's an accountant.

329
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:31,760

He's been helping me with the books.

330
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:50,610

-Yeah. -I can't even remember

331
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:52,180

the last time I got laid.

332
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:54,020

How long's it been?

333
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:56,150

Oh, shit.

334
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:57,590

Year and a half, maybe.

335
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:58,920

Mm.

336
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,190

Well,

337
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:01,790

I could, uh,

338
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:03,830

organize something for you, if you want.

339
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:05,830

I hate knock shops.

340
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:07,160

No, I'd just get one of the girls from work

341
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,330

to come pay you a visit.

342
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:10,670

BRUCE: Mm.

343
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:11,940

Maybe.

344
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:13,970

Mm.

345
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:19,340

Can I ask you something?

346
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:21,510

Yeah.

347
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:26,350

When I don't feel like doing any of this anymore,

348
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:28,320

will you help me?

349
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:32,960

Help you with what?

350
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:35,630

You know...

351
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:38,230

call it quits.

352
00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:43,000

Die?

353
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:45,440

Yeah.

354
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,150

Cross that bridge when we come to it, mate, eh?

355
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,580

Yeah, okay.

356
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:03,050

RAY: You know, Britt'd miss you.

357
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:06,820

Yeah, I know.

358
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:09,990

I'd probably miss you for about five minutes.

359
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,700

You know, you guys are the only reason

360
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:20,640

I've stuck around as long as I have.

361
00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:24,370

Mm.

362
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,970

Ray. How are you?

363
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,740

How come you didn't come to the club?

364
00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:56,310

Yeah, sorry.

365
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:58,940

Totally forgot. My fault.

366
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:02,480

So, you gonna invite me in or...?

367
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:04,780

Yeah, 'course. Come in, come in.

368
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:09,250

So, what's been happening?

369
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:10,890

Oh, not much.

370
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,490

What's been happening with you?

371
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,820

Oh, mate, heaps, actually. Yeah.

372
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:17,060

I, um, had an audition for a pilot yesterday.

373
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:19,460

So, pretty stoked about that.

374
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,230

-Like a TV show? -Yeah.

375
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:22,970

Oh.

376
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,640

Yeah. It's, uh...

377
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:28,810

You here for the dough?

378
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,570

No, just thought I'd come around

379
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:32,140

and see how your acting career is going.

380
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:33,910

Yeah.

381
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:37,210

Uh, mate, I'm gonna have to get that to you on Wednesday.

382
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,820

Said you'd have the money, man.

383
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:41,290

No, I know. I know I did.

384
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,350

And I'm sorry, but I'm definitely gonna have it

385
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:44,790

by Wednesday. Definitely.

386
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:50,130

I have to give you a touch-up.

387
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:53,830

What? But Wednesday's two days away.

388
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:55,770

Yeah, I know when Wednesday is.

389
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:58,770

Okay.

390
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,170

Um...

391
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,310

well, could it not be the face?

392
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:03,370

It's got to be the face.

393
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:04,710

Why?

394
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:07,040

It's got to be somewhere where people can see it.

395
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,140

Why?

396
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,350

So, if Freddy sees you,

397
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:11,350

he knows I've done my job.

398
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,350

Okay.

399
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:16,550

Cool?

400
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:18,190

-Yep. -All right.

401
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:20,160

Cool. All right.

402
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:22,160

Don't-don't use my uke, please.

403
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:24,060

My nan gave me that.

404
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,630

Happy?

405
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:30,570

-Yeah. -Cool.

406
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,840

-Don't flinch, all right? -

407
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:34,070

- -Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.

408
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:36,170

Mate, mate, it's just my mum. It's just my mum, okay?

409
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:37,840

-Please. Pl... -Why didn't you fucking say something?

410
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:40,210

She's staying with me for a couple days.

411
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,380

Please?

412
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:45,820

Hello.

413
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:47,180

How you doing?

414
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,590

Mum, this is Ray. He's a mate of mine.

415
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:50,020

Hi. I'm Lorraine.

416
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:51,920

Nice to meet you.

417
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,920

Well, I'm gonna make a cuppa.

418
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,430

Would you boys like one?

419
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:58,030

Um...

420
00:19:58,060 --> 00:19:59,260

Yeah.

421
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:01,930

Thanks, love.

422
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:05,970

Mm-mmm.

423
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:12,210

So, what do you do, Ray?

424
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,710

Security, mainly.

425
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:15,550

-Oh. -Mm.

426
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:17,250

So, you're just here for a couple of days,

427
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,880

-are you? -Yes.

428
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:21,120

I'm actually living in Broken Hill at the moment.

429
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:22,720

Been there a few years now.

430
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:23,790

Oh, okay. Yeah.

431
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:25,050

I went through there a few years ago.

432
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:26,060

Nice, uh...

433
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:27,890

It's got a good feel to it.

434
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,530

Yeah, it's nice.

435
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:32,200

It's got a real community feel about it, which I like.

436
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:33,930

Yeah, well, you don't get much of that around here, do you?

437
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,200

No, you don't.

438
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:38,400

-Mm. -I lived in St Kilda for many years,

439
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,640

and there's very little community spirit there,

440
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:42,470

-I can tell you. -Mm.

441
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:44,640

Mm.

442
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:47,410

Mm. We better get going.

443
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,610

Oh, shit. Yeah.

444
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:52,820

Um, we got to pick up my sister from work, so...

445
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:56,320

Actually, Mum,

446
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:59,220

um, me and Ray--

447
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:02,230

we've got to r-rehearse for an audition I've got.

448
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:03,960

-Oh, another one? -Yeah.

449
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:06,230

So... is that all right?

450
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:07,960

Yeah. That's fine.

451
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,400

I'll take my car.

452
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:12,000

-JASON: Great. -Oh. I'll get that door for you, love.

453
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:15,140

Nice to meet you.

454
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:16,240

Nice to meet you, Ray.

455
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:17,310

Okay.

456
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:20,610

Oh, and... break a leg.

457
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,880

I will. Thanks.

458
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:27,250

Just-just not the teeth.

459
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,290

Hey? I've just spent eight grand on veneers.

460
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,690

-Anything else? - No, that's it.

461
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:34,920

Oh! Oh!

462
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,430

Oh... I've got it!

463
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:38,430

I've got it! I've got the fucking money.

464
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:40,000

: I've got it.

465
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:41,260

Fuck!

466
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,950

Why didn't you just give me the fucking money

467
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:02,350

when I asked for it?

468
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:07,220

I'm going to L.A. for pilot season.

469
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:11,130

No, you're not.

470
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,230

No, no, no, no, no, no!

471
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:26,580

* I said beautiful people *

472
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:29,650

* They've got a Robert Palmer T-shirt in their travel bag *

473
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,720

* Beautiful people *
