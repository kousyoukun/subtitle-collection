Back on the smokes?

00:00:52,262 --> 00:00:54,492
Yeah.

7
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:58,379
You find the kid?

8
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:00,099
Mm.

9
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:03,250
- That's good.
- Mm-hmm.

10
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,660
You can't work here no more, mate.

11
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,149
Sorry about all that
shit with your family.

00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:32,710
Yeah, so am I.

- How you going?
- Hi.

17
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,400
Sorry for scaring you the other day.

18
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,660
Didn't mean to.

19
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:56,620
You still want to come over?

20
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,740
You sure?

21
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:05,629
100% sure?

22
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:09,789
I want a budgie.

23
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:11,139
- A budgie?
- Yeah.

24
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:12,699
Can we have a budgie?

25
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:14,179
What do you want a budgie for?

26
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:16,800
- Because they're cute.
- Mm.

27
00:06:16,804 --> 00:06:18,357
Yeah, we'll see.

28
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:24,540
- You want something to eat?
- No, thanks.

29
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:35,220
- Britt.
- Hi.

30
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:39,160
What's news?

31
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:41,519
Nothing.

32
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,465
So have you written any more jokes?

33
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:46,300
No. I don't want to be a
stand-up comedian anymore.

34
00:06:46,301 --> 00:06:49,050
- How come?
- I want to be an actress.

35
00:06:49,053 --> 00:06:50,379
An actress?

36
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:52,079
Yeah. It pays better.

37
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,059
Well, if you're good at it, yeah.

38
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:56,189
At school we're doing a
Romeo and Juliet play,

39
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:58,059
and I want to audition for Juliet.

40
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:00,739
- Romeo and Juliet, hey?
- Yeah.

41
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:02,776
Oh, that's cool.

42
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,689
Hey, Britt.

43
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:07,859
Do you know who this is?

44
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,630
No.

45
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:11,279
This is your grandpa.

46
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,699
Hello, Brittany.

47
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,279
- Hi.
- How are you?

48
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,479
I'm good.

49
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,559
I'm so pleased to meet you.

50
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,859
- Me too.
- Well...

51
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:21,699
I didn't know I had a grandpa.

52
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:23,460
I know.

53
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,219
So...

54
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:28,039
are we gonna have a rematch?

55
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,639
- Of course.
- Uh-huh.

56
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,339
And you can play.

57
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:33,539
Right.

58
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:35,439
- What are we playing?
- Jenga.

59
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,510
- Jenga.
- Yeah.

60
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:49,640
Mm.

61
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:57,820
How are you, son?

62
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:05,779
Go inside, Britt.

63
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:08,360
- Why?
- Just go in the house.

64
00:09:02,273 --> 00:09:04,269
Sit down. Sit. Sit.

65
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:05,900
Good dog.

66
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:14,260
Good.

67
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,609
Cheers, mate. Mm.

68
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:45,770
Yeah. Hey.

69
00:10:35,932 --> 00:10:37,699
You out?

70
00:10:38,892 --> 00:10:41,078
Are you?

71
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:44,480
Yeah.

72
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,460
You want to show me?

73
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,920
- Let's see yours.
- All right.

74
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,740
Tough little cunt, aren't you?

75
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:53,200
Yeah, you fucker!

76
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,200
Oh, you fuck.

77
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,016
Nice eye.

78
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,220
Nice face.

79
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,080
Come on.

80
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:30,339
- Hey.
- Hey.

81
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:32,683
There he is. El presidente.

82
00:14:32,684 --> 00:14:34,935
What's going on?

83
00:14:34,936 --> 00:14:37,949
Oh, I got a tip-off about Vinnie.

84
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:39,482
Now, it could be all bullshit,

85
00:14:39,483 --> 00:14:42,220
but I got a name.

86
00:14:42,222 --> 00:14:43,689
Who?

87
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:46,860
Ray Sh-Shoes...

88
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:49,530
Ray Shoestring?

89
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,659
Ray Shoestring.

90
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:54,579
- Ray Shoestring.
- Yeah.

91
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:56,081
You ever heard of him?

92
00:14:56,082 --> 00:14:59,189
Doesn't ring any bells.

93
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:00,545
Who gave you the tip?

94
00:15:00,546 --> 00:15:03,129
I don't know. Just a phone call.

95
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:06,240
So what you want to do?

96
00:15:06,246 --> 00:15:08,240
Don't know.

97
00:15:08,248 --> 00:15:09,929
I'll make some calls, ask around, eh?

98
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:12,200
Yeah, right.

99
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:13,934
Do you want me to look into it?

100
00:15:13,935 --> 00:15:16,220
Nah, I'll take care of it.

101
00:15:16,227 --> 00:15:17,562
I'll bet you fucking will.

102
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,139
What are you doing?

103
00:15:39,334 --> 00:15:40,834
Well done, Ray.

104
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,979
So you want to drive?

105
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:47,040
Yeah.

106
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,320
- Let me ask you a question.
- Mm.

107
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:11,370
- Vinnie.
- Mm.

108
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:14,240
Was that quick?

109
00:16:16,272 --> 00:16:18,099
Yeah.

110
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:22,860
Good.

111
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:50,030
Let's go.

112
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:53,999
Come on.

113
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,040
All right.

114
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:14,020
So, what do youse want?

115
00:17:14,026 --> 00:17:15,589
- Huh?
- Well, I want you to die.

116
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:17,119
I mean how much do you want?

117
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,720
How much do we want for what?

118
00:17:18,726 --> 00:17:20,459
To let me slide.

119
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:22,250
Shit, I don't know.

120
00:17:22,251 --> 00:17:24,479
How much do you want, Raymond?

121
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,289
I don't know, man.

122
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:27,809
How much you got?

123
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:29,769
$650K, give or take.

124
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:31,199
- Really?
- Yeah.

125
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,059
- Where?
- It's buried.

126
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:35,189
It's, uh, four duffel
bags, filled to the brim.

127
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:36,209
All clean.

128
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:37,327
- What are you doing?
- So what's that split between two?

129
00:17:37,328 --> 00:17:38,869
650... what is that?

130
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:40,359
323...

131
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,449
It's 325.

132
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:42,539
- What are you doing?
- 25.

133
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:44,619
325 grand.

134
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:46,168
You happy with that, Ray?

135
00:17:46,169 --> 00:17:47,919
Not particularly.

136
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:51,629
You're not happy with $325,000?

137
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:55,639
Well, normally, I would
be, mate, but, uh,

138
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:58,138
your guys killed my fucking dog.

139
00:17:58,139 --> 00:18:01,019
Okay, I am sorry about that.

140
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:02,724
I didn't tell 'em to do it.
I have a dog.

141
00:18:02,725 --> 00:18:04,854
- I love dogs.
- As long as you're sorry, mate.

142
00:18:04,855 --> 00:18:07,559
I am sorry. I mean that. I do.

143
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,030
So where's this money?

144
00:18:09,037 --> 00:18:11,277
- Maroota.
- Where in Maroota?

145
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:14,179
How do I know you're gonna let me go?

146
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:15,779
'Cause we're just telling
you we'll let you go.

147
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:17,640
Well, I need a bit more than that.

148
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:18,699
Oh, do you? You know what,

149
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,019
- fuck this.
- Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

150
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:21,077
- Don't shoot him.
- Why not?

151
00:18:21,078 --> 00:18:22,199
Just throw him in the water, mate.

152
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,199
That's why I put the bloody
cuffs on his ankles.

153
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,619
Right. So we just...

154
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:28,219
we just drown the cunt.

155
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:30,003
Push him in.

156
00:18:30,004 --> 00:18:33,190
Where's the money?

157
00:18:33,192 --> 00:18:36,379
Well... how do I know you're
not gonna kill me here?

158
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:38,219
Oh, fuck. We're going around in circles.

159
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:39,460
What do you want to do?

160
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:40,760
That's a lot of money.

161
00:18:40,764 --> 00:18:41,975
Mate, what do you want us to do?

162
00:18:41,976 --> 00:18:43,499
Well, I got...

163
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:46,339
I just can't take your word for it, Ray.

164
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:48,319
Well, that's all we got, mate.
So if you don't believe us,

165
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,939
I don't know what to fucking tell you.

166
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:53,689
Okay. How about this?

167
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:55,729
We go to Maroota, right?

168
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:57,519
- Right, right? Good.
- Yeah. Yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

169
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,899
So, we get there, yeah?

170
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,785
When we get there, you park the car.

171
00:19:00,786 --> 00:19:01,879
I get out.

172
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,799
- You guys... We all get out of the car.
- Fuck me.

173
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,455
I stay at the car. I point
you in the direction

174
00:19:06,456 --> 00:19:07,839
of-of-of where the money is,

175
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,199
and you guys-you guys-you guys
walk over, you go get it.

176
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,209
And then what?

177
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:12,779
Then, when you get to the spot,

178
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:15,770
then I'll-I'll start walking off.

179
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:21,160
Do we look like a couple of fuckwits?

180
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,929
- Hmm?
- Okay.

181
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:27,099
How about you get there, you dig it up.

182
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,659
The money's... the
money's in a bag, yeah?

183
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:29,669
You dig up the bag.

184
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:31,040
- You get the bags...
- You-you know what,

185
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:32,679
this is what's fucking gonna happen.

186
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:35,239
All right? We'll stay by the car.

187
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,029
You know where the money
is, so you can toddle off

188
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:38,430
and you dig up the bags.

189
00:19:38,431 --> 00:19:39,549
- Right?
- Yeah.

190
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:40,559
- Yes.
- Yeah?

191
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,560
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah?

192
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:42,699
- Can we go?
- Yeah. We... Yeah.

193
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:44,520
We stay at the car.

194
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:47,279
That's not gonna work either.

195
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,289
Why?

196
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:50,859
What if he's got a fucking
gun in one of the bags?

197
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:52,609
Oh, fuck.

198
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:54,059
All right, here's what's
gonna happen, all right?

199
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:55,079
We stay at the car.

200
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,579
- You go back out there...
- No, no, no.

201
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:58,217
- No, he stays by the car.
- Okay.

202
00:19:58,218 --> 00:20:00,009
You stay... He stays by the car.

203
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:01,239
I know what I meant to say, right?

204
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,299
I know what I meant to say.
He stays by the car.

205
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:05,119
- Mm.
- Right? We go out there

206
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,699
and we dig up the bags, right?

207
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:08,959
Make sure the money's all there.

208
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,760
And then I'll give you a signal, right?

209
00:20:11,768 --> 00:20:13,148
Make sure everything's okay. And then...

210
00:20:13,149 --> 00:20:15,439
and then, only then...

211
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,469
he can go.

212
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:17,487
- Yeah.
- Okay.

213
00:20:17,488 --> 00:20:19,399
Mm. Mm.

214
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,499
Is that-is that... Yeah?

215
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,959
- That's it. Yeah.
- S-Signal?

216
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:23,979
- Yeah.
- Okay.

217
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:25,239
- Yeah.
- We happy?

218
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,560
- Well, let's go to Maroota.
- Let's go.

219
00:20:34,661 --> 00:20:36,370
Oh, you...

220
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,999
In you go.

221
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,490
I don't want to sound
like a pain in the ass,

222
00:20:45,498 --> 00:20:47,183
but can I just ride in
the car with you guys?

223
00:20:47,184 --> 00:20:48,729
Absolutely not.

224
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:50,799
Come on. I suffer from claustrophobia.

225
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,349
You're gonna suffer from lead poisoning

226
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:54,650
if you don't fucking get in there.

227
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,809
Fuck.

228
00:20:57,810 --> 00:20:59,969
Come on.

229
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:00,979
Oh.

230
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:02,099
- You all right?
- Yes!

231
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,116
Watch your fingers.

232
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:28,750
