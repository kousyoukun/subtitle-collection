1
00:00:03,971 --> 00:00:05,473
<i>Previously on</i> SEAL Team...

2
00:00:05,573 --> 00:00:07,733
My integrated deterrence
partnership has been approved.

3
00:00:07,808 --> 00:00:09,477
You ready for your
new role at DEVGRU?

4
00:00:09,577 --> 00:00:10,744
I won't let you down, sir.

5
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:12,246
Do you remember Ben,

6
00:00:12,346 --> 00:00:14,848
<i>the vet that Clay
was trying to help?</i>

7
00:00:14,948 --> 00:00:16,884
Ben pled to, uh,
felony vandalism.

8
00:00:16,984 --> 00:00:19,520
Stella is gonna show up
and ask for leniency.

9
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:20,697
She asked if I
would go with her.

10
00:00:20,721 --> 00:00:21,722
The job's changing,

11
00:00:21,822 --> 00:00:22,822
op tempo with it.

12
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:24,134
If you've conquered
all the demons

13
00:00:24,158 --> 00:00:25,893
war made you endure,
then Brad can, too.

14
00:00:27,295 --> 00:00:30,030
That public temper
tantrum that you threw

15
00:00:30,131 --> 00:00:31,599
didn't win you many
hearts and minds.

16
00:00:31,699 --> 00:00:33,767
I would just like to
know why my teammates

17
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:35,436
<i>are suffering for my actions.</i>

18
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:37,037
15 years as an exemplary SEAL,

19
00:00:37,138 --> 00:00:39,507
and I end up in
Command's doghouse.

20
00:00:39,607 --> 00:00:41,842
- Not sure you all have met.
- Drew Franklin.

21
00:00:41,942 --> 00:00:44,154
- Thought he was an urban legend.
- You're all here for an assignment.

22
00:00:44,178 --> 00:00:45,879
You all will be
spending the next month

23
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:47,315
working with Swedish SOG.

24
00:00:47,415 --> 00:00:49,193
No, he can't boss me
because he's not my boss.

25
00:00:49,217 --> 00:00:51,485
He's Bravo 1, and he
outranks all of us.

26
00:00:51,585 --> 00:00:53,087
- Ah, this isn't an op.
- Relax, dude.

27
00:00:53,187 --> 00:00:54,622
It's detention.

28
00:00:56,557 --> 00:00:58,292
We got active
shooters in the mall.

29
00:00:58,392 --> 00:00:59,627
This is a coordinated attack.

30
00:00:59,727 --> 00:01:02,263
We got no weapons between
us to take 'em out.

31
00:01:09,137 --> 00:01:12,240
Shitbirds inside are using
civilians for target practice.

32
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:13,941
Bombs and shooters?

33
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:15,481
This is more than
a lone wolf attack.

34
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:16,944
So who's doing it?

35
00:01:17,044 --> 00:01:18,855
- Feels like Mumbai or Beslan.
- All that matters is,

36
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:20,479
whoever they are, they
get put down hard.

37
00:01:20,514 --> 00:01:21,925
- Where's a SAW when you need one?
- All right, look.

38
00:01:21,949 --> 00:01:23,560
Being unarmed, that
doesn't make us helpless.

39
00:01:23,584 --> 00:01:25,253
Ray, Omar, stay here,
triage the wounded.

40
00:01:25,353 --> 00:01:27,264
- We'll do what we can, boss.
- All right, Brock,

41
00:01:27,288 --> 00:01:29,423
Sonny, Drew, with
me inside the mall.

42
00:01:29,523 --> 00:01:31,568
We're gonna help whoever we
can however we can, got it?

43
00:01:31,592 --> 00:01:33,036
First responders are gonna
need intel when they arrive.

44
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:34,638
Save 'em some time if
you can get the shooters'

45
00:01:34,662 --> 00:01:36,173
- numbers and locations.
- All right, look.

46
00:01:36,197 --> 00:01:38,566
Without comms, we use cell
phones to communicate.

47
00:01:38,666 --> 00:01:40,668
You better AirDrop those
Bat Phone digits there,

48
00:01:40,768 --> 00:01:42,503
Drewce Wayne.

49
00:01:44,238 --> 00:01:46,307
Okay.

50
00:01:46,407 --> 00:01:47,775
Got it. You solid?

51
00:01:47,875 --> 00:01:49,777
- Let's move.
- Jace.

52
00:01:51,245 --> 00:01:53,526
You sure you don't want me or
Omar inside instead of Drew?

53
00:01:53,614 --> 00:01:54,882
Guy's a total wild card.

54
00:01:54,982 --> 00:01:56,360
That's exactly why I
want him on my hip,

55
00:01:56,384 --> 00:01:57,985
so I can manage him, all right?

56
00:01:58,085 --> 00:01:59,453
Roger that.

57
00:02:09,263 --> 00:02:10,831
Move. Get to your right.

58
00:02:14,268 --> 00:02:16,437
I've got an unknown over here.

59
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,040
Sonny, Brock, bump up.

60
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,485
See if you can get
eyes on the shooter.

61
00:02:21,509 --> 00:02:23,143
Okay, easy. Help him out.

62
00:02:26,614 --> 00:02:27,648
Come on.

63
00:02:27,748 --> 00:02:28,792
- Anything?
- The lights are on

64
00:02:28,816 --> 00:02:30,184
but nobody's answering.

65
00:02:30,284 --> 00:02:32,162
- Should we exfil him?
- Nah, the people deeper inside

66
00:02:32,186 --> 00:02:33,487
the mall are more in danger.

67
00:02:33,587 --> 00:02:35,189
Let's try and get
him up. Go easy.

68
00:02:36,457 --> 00:02:37,467
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Over here.

69
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:38,392
Help us out with this guy.

70
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:39,993
We got to get him out now.

71
00:02:40,093 --> 00:02:41,695
Easy on his leg. All right?

72
00:02:41,795 --> 00:02:43,964
Go to your right.
Okay, move, move.

73
00:02:59,647 --> 00:03:01,515
Sounds like the good guys
with guns are coming.

74
00:03:01,615 --> 00:03:02,750
It's about fucking time.

75
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:03,951
Sonny?

76
00:03:04,051 --> 00:03:06,053
I got eyes on three
of these assholes.

77
00:03:06,153 --> 00:03:08,155
They got AKs, chest
rigs and sidearms.

78
00:03:08,256 --> 00:03:09,523
Is that all of them?

79
00:03:09,623 --> 00:03:11,100
Think there's a fourth.
Haven't seen him yet,

80
00:03:11,124 --> 00:03:12,302
but I can definitely
hear his gun.

81
00:03:12,326 --> 00:03:13,827
It's carnage, Jace.

82
00:03:13,927 --> 00:03:15,639
We just got to keep doing
what we're doing till the cops

83
00:03:15,663 --> 00:03:18,299
storm this fucking place
with guns a-blazing.

84
00:03:23,737 --> 00:03:25,306
Get down!

85
00:03:25,406 --> 00:03:26,574
Get down!

86
00:03:28,576 --> 00:03:30,077
Get down!

87
00:03:30,177 --> 00:03:31,712
Folks are Swedish
fish in a barrel.

88
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,482
We can't just watch
them get mowed down.

89
00:03:34,582 --> 00:03:35,982
It's a good thing
this guy can't hit

90
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:38,185
- two targets at the same time.
- Playing decoy

91
00:03:38,286 --> 00:03:39,846
without our kit ain't
a good idea, Jace.

92
00:03:43,524 --> 00:03:44,858
I've got this, old-timers.

93
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:46,226
Easy, all right?

94
00:03:46,327 --> 00:03:47,795
Save that speed
for the civilians.

95
00:03:47,895 --> 00:03:49,997
When I move, you move.

96
00:04:00,408 --> 00:04:01,642
Come on!

97
00:04:04,011 --> 00:04:05,346
Go, go, go!

98
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:15,423
Down the stairs, let's go.

99
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:37,545
Copy that, 1.

100
00:04:37,645 --> 00:04:40,147
I'll relay that info.

101
00:04:40,247 --> 00:04:41,882
Hey.

102
00:04:42,716 --> 00:04:44,761
I'm going to give the police
an intel dump from Jason.

103
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:46,687
- You good?
- Solid. Go.

104
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:49,256
- All right.
- All right, let's see here.

105
00:04:57,164 --> 00:04:58,766
Oh, oh...

106
00:05:00,734 --> 00:05:02,603
Uh...

107
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,016
Oh, oh. I'm an American,
I'm here to help.

108
00:05:49,116 --> 00:05:50,818
What are you doing here?

109
00:05:50,918 --> 00:05:52,662
I'm U.S. military, here
on a training exercise.

110
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:55,556
Four of my teammates are inside
helping to evacuate people.

111
00:05:55,656 --> 00:05:56,757
When are you moving in?

112
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:58,435
Ambulance and paramedics
are on their way.

113
00:05:58,459 --> 00:05:59,593
What about the shooters?

114
00:06:01,629 --> 00:06:03,296
You need to assault.
People are dying.

115
00:06:11,004 --> 00:06:12,339
Talk to me, Ray.

116
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,983
Yeah, the police are
here, but they're holding

117
00:06:14,007 --> 00:06:15,367
for their tactical
team to show up.

118
00:06:15,443 --> 00:06:17,645
Fuck SWAT. Fucking clown show.

119
00:06:19,179 --> 00:06:20,213
Yeah.

120
00:06:20,313 --> 00:06:22,315
Nobody's moving in?

121
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:25,719
Waiting for the
goddamn tactical team.

122
00:06:25,819 --> 00:06:26,887
That could take hours.

123
00:06:26,987 --> 00:06:29,056
You remember Nairobi?

124
00:06:31,191 --> 00:06:32,793
These people don't
got time, Jace.

125
00:06:34,595 --> 00:06:36,072
Yeah, we're the only
motherfuckers here

126
00:06:36,096 --> 00:06:37,598
who can do anything.

127
00:06:37,698 --> 00:06:39,066
Time to go on the offensive.

128
00:06:52,813 --> 00:06:55,315
Four guys with AKs against
four guys with cell phones

129
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:58,085
isn't a fair fight,
almighty Bravo or not.

130
00:06:58,185 --> 00:07:00,087
Nancy Drew already
solved this case.

131
00:07:00,187 --> 00:07:02,189
Our arsenal is as thin
as a fiddle string.

132
00:07:02,289 --> 00:07:03,924
My grandninny
always taught me not

133
00:07:04,024 --> 00:07:05,535
to dig up more snakes
than I could kill.

134
00:07:05,559 --> 00:07:06,736
Slow is smooth, smooth is fast.

135
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,095
One step at a time.

136
00:07:08,195 --> 00:07:09,997
- Yeah, what's step one?
- Get a gun.

137
00:07:17,337 --> 00:07:18,772
What have you got?

138
00:07:18,872 --> 00:07:20,517
Broken femur. Makeshift
splint isn't much help.

139
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:21,675
We need to stabilize it.

140
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:23,577
The ambulance
should be here soon.

141
00:07:27,114 --> 00:07:28,782
It's got to be her
femoral artery.

142
00:07:30,317 --> 00:07:31,397
Broken bone must've cut it.

143
00:07:38,091 --> 00:07:39,459
All right, look, we need

144
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,520
to rig up a pressure
dressing to buy us some time.

145
00:07:47,901 --> 00:07:49,603
Samara...

146
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:56,209
Hey, look, grab me
that baby bottle.

147
00:08:02,182 --> 00:08:03,584
Thinking the lid

148
00:08:03,684 --> 00:08:05,819
- will make a plug for the artery?
- I'm gonna try.

149
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:08,689
It won't hold long.

150
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:22,378
What, are you worried
about her lungs?

151
00:08:22,402 --> 00:08:23,412
Blast wave injuries are tricky

152
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:24,476
without that X-ray vision.

153
00:08:25,806 --> 00:08:27,875
Oh, God, this isn't working.

154
00:08:27,975 --> 00:08:29,242
Hey.

155
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:30,744
Let me, uh...

156
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:32,412
let me see if the cops

157
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,514
have a trauma kit with a
proper tourniquet, okay?

158
00:08:34,615 --> 00:08:36,359
All right, but what
about the girl? She okay?

159
00:08:36,383 --> 00:08:38,385
Keep an eye on her.

160
00:09:02,976 --> 00:09:05,112
Looks like we found
our rifle, boys.

161
00:09:05,212 --> 00:09:07,180
We're getting sucked
into the room.

162
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,717
Brock, how long will
it take for Pepper

163
00:09:09,817 --> 00:09:11,619
to get on the bite from here?

164
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:17,424
About five seconds or so.

165
00:09:17,524 --> 00:09:18,558
About three fewer seconds

166
00:09:18,659 --> 00:09:19,860
than it takes to reload an AK.

167
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,037
As soon as he goes
dry, you send him.

168
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:22,421
We're gonna need
to be on him fast.

169
00:09:22,495 --> 00:09:23,495
Follow the dog.

170
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:25,565
- Dead nuts sprint.
- Fuck yeah.

171
00:09:28,669 --> 00:09:30,370
Pepper...

172
00:09:40,848 --> 00:09:42,816
50 grand of dog training
finally pays off, right?

173
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,718
I got dibs on the big gun.

174
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:51,258
Jackpot. Now we can finally get
in these psychos' game plan.

175
00:09:51,358 --> 00:09:52,836
Yeah, if only any
of us spoke Swedish.

176
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:54,494
Hey.

177
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,296
Over here. Come here.

178
00:09:56,396 --> 00:09:57,396
You speak English?

179
00:09:57,464 --> 00:09:58,966
<i>Ja.</i>

180
00:09:59,066 --> 00:10:01,010
This is what I want you to do,
I want you to head that way,

181
00:10:01,034 --> 00:10:02,712
back to the main entrance.
It's all clear there.

182
00:10:02,736 --> 00:10:04,013
Give this to the
police. You understand?

183
00:10:04,037 --> 00:10:05,305
Good.

184
00:10:07,574 --> 00:10:10,077
All right, look,
we got two teams.

185
00:10:10,177 --> 00:10:11,611
Me and Drew with the Glock,

186
00:10:11,712 --> 00:10:13,413
Sonny, Brock, the AK.

187
00:10:13,513 --> 00:10:14,991
- Got it?
- We got three guys that are still vertical.

188
00:10:15,015 --> 00:10:16,817
What's the plan, Jace?

189
00:10:16,917 --> 00:10:18,318
Straight hunter killer.

190
00:10:18,418 --> 00:10:19,820
Put them down and end this.

191
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,655
Straight up. Sonny, head east.

192
00:10:21,755 --> 00:10:24,075
- We got west. Let's roll.
- Let's go make that Navy money.

193
00:10:42,275 --> 00:10:43,376
Samara?

194
00:10:44,611 --> 00:10:45,946
Samara?

195
00:10:47,781 --> 00:10:49,116
Samara!

196
00:10:50,283 --> 00:10:51,852
Help her, please.

197
00:10:51,952 --> 00:10:54,054
Please! Please...

198
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:55,164
If the plug comes
out of your leg,

199
00:10:55,188 --> 00:10:56,489
you'll die.

200
00:10:57,758 --> 00:10:58,838
You're too weak to hold it.

201
00:11:00,761 --> 00:11:03,263
If she dies, I have
no reason to live.

202
00:11:03,363 --> 00:11:06,233
Please, I can manage.

203
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:09,636
If you save her, you'll
have saved me, too.

204
00:11:09,737 --> 00:11:12,272
Please. Please!

205
00:11:17,911 --> 00:11:20,447
All right, just-just,
just keep holding tight.

206
00:11:25,753 --> 00:11:27,163
All right, I'm gonna
relieve the pressure

207
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:29,256
that's built up in
her chest cavity.

208
00:11:52,913 --> 00:11:54,514
Let's move.

209
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:09,296
What's Swedish for
Mexican standoff?

210
00:12:10,663 --> 00:12:12,232
Sure could use that
rifle right now.

211
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:23,743
Can Pepper fetch as good
as she takes a shit?

212
00:12:23,844 --> 00:12:25,012
Not a chance.

213
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:29,282
Right, left. Right,
right, right, left.

214
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:31,618
Hey.

215
00:12:31,718 --> 00:12:33,320
- Please...
- Where you hurt?

216
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,755
My leg. They shot me.

217
00:12:35,856 --> 00:12:37,424
That's a lot of blood.

218
00:12:37,524 --> 00:12:39,226
We'll need to get
him back to the CCP.

219
00:12:39,326 --> 00:12:41,294
I can't leave.

220
00:12:41,394 --> 00:12:43,163
I sent my children inside
that store to hide.

221
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:45,208
Slow down, all right? You're no
good to 'em out here like this,

222
00:12:45,232 --> 00:12:46,266
you understand me?

223
00:12:46,366 --> 00:12:47,634
I promise I'll get your kids

224
00:12:47,734 --> 00:12:49,002
back to you safe.

225
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:51,038
- Here.
- No, no, no, you take it.

226
00:12:51,138 --> 00:12:52,882
There could be more enemy back
there where we cleared before.

227
00:12:52,906 --> 00:12:54,975
You understand? Plus
he's gonna slow you down.

228
00:12:55,075 --> 00:12:56,209
Let's get him up.

229
00:12:56,309 --> 00:12:57,477
- Okay.
- Got it?

230
00:12:57,577 --> 00:12:58,979
Got him?

231
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:02,782
- Hey, keep your head on a swivel.
- I got you.

232
00:13:05,752 --> 00:13:06,954
I got two mags left.

233
00:13:07,054 --> 00:13:09,689
Nothing's gonna change
unless something changes.

234
00:13:10,891 --> 00:13:11,992
Then we got to flank him.

235
00:13:15,095 --> 00:13:16,705
That's gonna be awful
hard with one weapon.

236
00:13:16,729 --> 00:13:19,666
He's got to think he's being
flanked on both sides, okay?

237
00:13:19,766 --> 00:13:21,468
- Here, take this.
- Okay.

238
00:13:21,568 --> 00:13:23,770
Time to shine, Pepper.
Let's go, baby.

239
00:13:23,871 --> 00:13:27,274
Set. Set, set.

240
00:13:33,246 --> 00:13:34,347
Pepper!

241
00:13:53,533 --> 00:13:55,568
That's three down.

242
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:57,871
Make sure you grab his rifle.

243
00:13:59,439 --> 00:14:01,574
How do you not have
one single trauma kit?

244
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:03,610
You got a woman fighting
for her life over there.

245
00:14:05,512 --> 00:14:07,632
Look, if you won't do something
for the people inside,

246
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,083
at least do something
for the people out here.

247
00:14:11,451 --> 00:14:12,552
What?

248
00:14:15,422 --> 00:14:16,990
What is it?

249
00:14:21,261 --> 00:14:22,261
Go.

250
00:14:22,329 --> 00:14:25,165
That radio you grabbed
was a gold mine.

251
00:14:25,265 --> 00:14:27,476
Police just told me there's a
third enemy element operating.

252
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,445
Third element? What are you
fucking talking about, Ray?

253
00:14:29,469 --> 00:14:30,749
We just took out three shooters.

254
00:14:30,837 --> 00:14:32,339
<i>It's mobile, Jason.</i>

255
00:14:32,439 --> 00:14:34,374
<i>Suicide bomber headed
straight for the CCP.</i>

256
00:14:34,474 --> 00:14:36,476
<i>They're targeting all
the people we saved.</i>

257
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:45,028
All right, get Sonny and
Brock back to the CCP.

258
00:14:45,052 --> 00:14:46,562
It's obvious that we're the
only ones who know how to deal

259
00:14:46,586 --> 00:14:48,021
with a vehicle-borne IED.

260
00:14:48,121 --> 00:14:49,121
Okay, what about you?

261
00:14:49,189 --> 00:14:50,490
<i>Look, I got kids in here</i>

262
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:52,259
and at least one
more shooter. Move.

263
00:14:52,359 --> 00:14:53,393
<i>Copy.</i>

264
00:14:55,828 --> 00:14:57,830
Whoa, easy.

265
00:14:57,931 --> 00:15:00,367
Easy. I'm your friend,
I'm here to help you.

266
00:15:00,467 --> 00:15:02,735
I'm gonna get you
back to your dad.

267
00:15:02,835 --> 00:15:04,371
Stand up, come on.

268
00:15:04,471 --> 00:15:06,311
We're gonna get out of
here. Everything's okay.

269
00:15:08,675 --> 00:15:11,078
Okay...

270
00:15:11,178 --> 00:15:13,180
Get in there.

271
00:15:37,337 --> 00:15:39,177
- Get down! Get down!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,

272
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:40,516
- whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...
- Blue, blue, blue!

273
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:41,441
No, no, no.

274
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:42,909
These are my friends.

275
00:15:44,511 --> 00:15:47,080
Struck out on the trauma kit.

276
00:15:48,248 --> 00:15:49,816
Doesn't matter.

277
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:53,353
When Samara wakes up, her whole
world's gonna turn upside down.

278
00:16:02,729 --> 00:16:03,963
Hey.

279
00:16:05,999 --> 00:16:07,959
I need you to get yourself
back in the game, okay?

280
00:16:09,402 --> 00:16:10,770
I'm solid.

281
00:16:11,738 --> 00:16:12,772
What's going on?

282
00:16:14,107 --> 00:16:16,009
We got a VBIED headed
straight for us right now.

283
00:16:16,109 --> 00:16:17,277
How far out?

284
00:16:17,377 --> 00:16:18,787
They're trying to
locate its position

285
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:21,048
listening in to their comms,
but let's assume close.

286
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:25,218
All these people are hurt bad.

287
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:27,454
I mean, anyone still at
the CCP is nonambulatory.

288
00:16:27,554 --> 00:16:28,954
And we don't have
time to move them.

289
00:16:29,022 --> 00:16:30,466
All right, on us to
hold the line then.

290
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:31,667
Well, I ain't ever
been that good at math,

291
00:16:31,691 --> 00:16:34,261
but my calculation's
we're one gun short.

292
00:16:38,198 --> 00:16:39,699
I write traffic tickets.

293
00:16:42,235 --> 00:16:43,470
Appreciate the trust.

294
00:16:44,737 --> 00:16:45,772
All right.

295
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:49,576
Well, some of us haven't fired
a shot that counts since Mosul.

296
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:50,977
Get ready to knock
that rust off.

297
00:16:51,078 --> 00:16:52,112
Hey, Drew.

298
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:54,681
We could use a hand.

299
00:16:54,781 --> 00:16:56,249
I got to get back inside.

300
00:16:57,884 --> 00:16:59,186
Definitely not a team guy.

301
00:17:02,922 --> 00:17:04,357
They're all sitting
ducks out here.

302
00:17:09,762 --> 00:17:11,631
So let's put a force
field around them.

303
00:17:13,266 --> 00:17:14,534
Come on, let's move.

304
00:18:05,618 --> 00:18:07,687
Not exactly impenetrable.

305
00:18:07,787 --> 00:18:09,665
We got to stack three more
cars to be fully shields up.

306
00:18:09,689 --> 00:18:12,091
- All right.
- Vehicle is inbound!

307
00:18:12,192 --> 00:18:14,093
Mag check.

308
00:18:14,194 --> 00:18:16,263
Make sure you're hot.

309
00:18:45,192 --> 00:18:46,226
Make your shots count!

310
00:18:46,326 --> 00:18:48,328
If we can't stop the
car, stop the driver.

311
00:18:57,604 --> 00:18:58,938
Car's gonna make it through.

312
00:18:59,038 --> 00:19:00,907
On me, on me!

313
00:19:06,613 --> 00:19:08,748
Got to move, go,
go! A few more feet!

314
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:12,552
Break off, break off! Break off!

315
00:19:27,867 --> 00:19:30,303
Oh, please tell me
that's the last of them.

316
00:20:33,165 --> 00:20:35,468
Fuck.

317
00:20:56,689 --> 00:20:57,890
It's over.

318
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:00,593
The assault team's moving in.

319
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:13,373
As my suggestion to
individually review

320
00:21:13,473 --> 00:21:16,709
potential joint operations
met some resistance yesterday,

321
00:21:16,809 --> 00:21:18,645
I'd like for us to walk
through one together,

322
00:21:18,745 --> 00:21:20,947
get a feel for the boxes
that Naval Special Warfare

323
00:21:21,047 --> 00:21:23,716
wants checked before signing
on as a partner force.

324
00:21:23,816 --> 00:21:26,986
Box one: is it an appropriate
use of Tier One assets,

325
00:21:27,086 --> 00:21:29,756
the most lethal weapons we
have against terrorists?

326
00:21:30,723 --> 00:21:32,267
That's a fair question,
Lieutenant Commander.

327
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:36,195
One of many that we need to be
asking as SOCOM tries to balance

328
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:38,431
boots-on-the-ground
counterterrorism actions

329
00:21:38,531 --> 00:21:40,331
with state-level adversary
deterrence efforts.

330
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,802
All due respect,
Lieutenant Davis,

331
00:21:42,902 --> 00:21:45,204
you're the only one in this
room who's never actually been

332
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:47,039
boots on the ground
fighting terrorists.

333
00:21:48,074 --> 00:21:49,809
Well, if we're
trading battle scars,

334
00:21:49,909 --> 00:21:52,154
I took a rifle butt to the head
from Venezuelan Special Police,

335
00:21:52,178 --> 00:21:54,381
but I'd rather stay focused
on the task at hand, sir.

336
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:59,919
The ATF is disrupting arms
trafficking in the Caribbean.

337
00:22:00,019 --> 00:22:01,988
Pretty sure Admiral Rivas
said we're worried about

338
00:22:02,088 --> 00:22:04,524
Russia, China, Iran.

339
00:22:04,624 --> 00:22:06,034
The transnational
criminal organizations

340
00:22:06,058 --> 00:22:07,370
that are trafficking
arms in the Caribbean

341
00:22:07,394 --> 00:22:09,529
are disrupting and disabling
America's backyard,

342
00:22:09,629 --> 00:22:12,832
providing those nations with
an opportunity to infiltrate...

343
00:22:12,932 --> 00:22:15,201
Sorry to interrupt, but
I need our ops officer.

344
00:22:15,301 --> 00:22:18,137
Seems Bravo Team disrupted
a terrorist attack.

345
00:22:18,237 --> 00:22:20,272
Terrorist attack? In Sweden?

346
00:22:20,373 --> 00:22:21,617
We don't have all
the details yet,

347
00:22:21,641 --> 00:22:23,009
but sounds like
authorities there

348
00:22:23,109 --> 00:22:25,445
were completely unprepared
for something of this scale.

349
00:22:25,545 --> 00:22:27,380
It's a good thing our
door-kickers were there.

350
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,315
A reminder...

351
00:22:29,416 --> 00:22:31,618
of what we do best.

352
00:22:40,793 --> 00:22:44,163
Well, I won't pretend I'm
sorry we're heading home early.

353
00:22:44,263 --> 00:22:47,299
That was definitely the
worst FID I ever been on.

354
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:50,269
Issues are usually
boredom and bad food,

355
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:52,939
not a group of murderous
ultranationalists.

356
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:54,807
Is that who they were?

357
00:22:54,907 --> 00:22:57,777
Forgot to ask them
before shooting them.

358
00:22:57,877 --> 00:23:01,481
Yeah, the news had a statement
claiming responsibility.

359
00:23:01,581 --> 00:23:03,683
"Making a stand for the...

360
00:23:03,783 --> 00:23:05,985
untainted heritage
of their motherland."

361
00:23:07,153 --> 00:23:10,490
A stand that got them wrecked
after losing a five-gun lead?

362
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:11,891
- Right?
- Yeah.

363
00:23:11,991 --> 00:23:14,026
Bravo for the win.

364
00:23:15,161 --> 00:23:16,696
Still feels like we
could've done more.

365
00:23:16,796 --> 00:23:17,897
Hey.

366
00:23:17,997 --> 00:23:20,099
You saved that
woman's daughter, man.

367
00:23:20,199 --> 00:23:21,279
You granted her dying wish.

368
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:23,736
There's nothing more
you could've done.

369
00:23:24,771 --> 00:23:26,539
Okay?

370
00:23:26,639 --> 00:23:28,174
Yeah.

371
00:23:29,141 --> 00:23:30,543
Think Command
bringing us home means

372
00:23:30,643 --> 00:23:32,020
they're putting us
back in the fight?

373
00:23:32,044 --> 00:23:33,746
I mean, come on. What
else they gonna do?

374
00:23:33,846 --> 00:23:35,915
After we pulled that off, yeah?

375
00:23:36,015 --> 00:23:37,416
Especially you, Pep.

376
00:23:37,517 --> 00:23:40,319
Hey, Pep, yeah, yeah, right.

377
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:42,855
Yeah? Well, I'll
tell you what, Pep.

378
00:23:42,955 --> 00:23:46,926
<i>Old Yeller...</i> well, it makes
me sadder than spilt bourbon.

379
00:23:49,629 --> 00:23:51,864
Uh, definitely, uh,

380
00:23:51,964 --> 00:23:54,000
all played our parts.

381
00:23:54,967 --> 00:23:56,769
What do you say, Drew?

382
00:23:56,869 --> 00:23:58,871
Yeah?

383
00:23:58,971 --> 00:24:01,508
How'd it feel to be
babysat by Bravo 1?

384
00:24:01,608 --> 00:24:03,109
Huh?

385
00:24:03,209 --> 00:24:04,753
Well, actually, it was
the other way around,

386
00:24:04,777 --> 00:24:06,412
since you asked.

387
00:24:06,513 --> 00:24:08,713
- The hell you talking about?
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

388
00:24:08,748 --> 00:24:10,249
Don't encourage
this huckster, Ray.

389
00:24:10,349 --> 00:24:12,552
Just wait till Jace
gets in earshot

390
00:24:12,652 --> 00:24:14,654
and slaps his lying mouth.

391
00:24:14,754 --> 00:24:16,956
Well, Tango had the drop on him.

392
00:24:17,056 --> 00:24:19,058
I hit his light switch
with one 40-yard shot.

393
00:24:20,693 --> 00:24:22,662
Oh, that's such bullshit.

394
00:24:22,762 --> 00:24:24,039
There's no way in hell
you can make a shot

395
00:24:24,063 --> 00:24:25,164
like that with a pistol.

396
00:24:25,264 --> 00:24:26,566
Well, maybe you can't.

397
00:24:29,702 --> 00:24:31,246
Oh, so the tale about
you forging your score

398
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:33,840
at a sniper contest is one
rumor we can cross out?

399
00:24:36,709 --> 00:24:38,711
No, that happened.

400
00:24:39,712 --> 00:24:41,213
Oh, you ain't cheating,

401
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:43,550
you ain't trying, boys.

402
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:54,927
Well, I just got off
the phone with Command.

403
00:24:55,027 --> 00:24:58,264
- Yeah?
- They gonna plan a parade for us? Shit.

404
00:24:58,364 --> 00:25:02,468
Ah, they think that, uh,
we compromised our presence

405
00:25:02,569 --> 00:25:04,270
by running into the fire.

406
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:06,138
They can't expect us
to sit on our hands

407
00:25:06,238 --> 00:25:08,240
- while people are dying around us.
- Really don't

408
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:11,711
know what the fuck they
expect from us anymore.

409
00:25:11,811 --> 00:25:14,346
But what I do know is that
our shore duty continues.

410
00:25:22,822 --> 00:25:24,657
Hey, guys, look,

411
00:25:24,757 --> 00:25:26,626
remember,

412
00:25:26,726 --> 00:25:28,227
w-we didn't help out back there

413
00:25:28,327 --> 00:25:30,296
to get in Command's
good graces, okay?

414
00:25:32,632 --> 00:25:34,333
All right, we did
it to save lives.

415
00:25:34,433 --> 00:25:37,203
We did it because it was
the right thing to do.

416
00:25:37,303 --> 00:25:40,006
Yeah, best we could, anyway.

417
00:25:40,106 --> 00:25:41,608
It's crazy how I was relieved

418
00:25:41,708 --> 00:25:43,743
when the VBIED came
in and I had a target.

419
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:47,556
It's pretty twisted that it
takes more of an emotional toll

420
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:51,183
to help people
than... to kill 'em.

421
00:26:03,495 --> 00:26:05,698
Bravo okay? All coming
home in one piece?

422
00:26:05,798 --> 00:26:08,200
Yeah, they may be the
problem child of DEVGRU,

423
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:09,902
but Bravo knows how to win.

424
00:26:10,002 --> 00:26:12,038
Well, hope this gets
Command back on their side.

425
00:26:12,138 --> 00:26:14,774
Actually, I'd like to
get Command on my side.

426
00:26:14,874 --> 00:26:17,043
Are you saying DEVGRU's
resistant to change?

427
00:26:17,143 --> 00:26:18,577
Well, they all nodded

428
00:26:18,678 --> 00:26:20,579
when Admiral Rivas
explained the strategy.

429
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:23,215
Didn't make me think I'd get
pushback every step of the way.

430
00:26:23,315 --> 00:26:25,417
Yeah, I feel like
there's a metaphor

431
00:26:25,517 --> 00:26:28,554
about trying to turn an aircraft
carrier that's apt here.

432
00:26:28,655 --> 00:26:30,056
I wish it were just that.

433
00:26:30,156 --> 00:26:31,624
This feels personal.

434
00:26:31,724 --> 00:26:34,861
Like, "You don't have a
Trident. Who let you speak?"

435
00:26:34,961 --> 00:26:37,129
Well, there's a good
chance you're right.

436
00:26:37,229 --> 00:26:39,231
But if they're not
willing to work with you,

437
00:26:39,331 --> 00:26:43,035
what's to stop you from carrying
out the assignment yourself?

438
00:26:43,135 --> 00:26:45,404
Rivas gave it to
you for a reason.

439
00:26:52,144 --> 00:26:54,681
So you bailed on the VBIED

440
00:26:54,781 --> 00:26:57,850
'cause you were looking
out for Jace, huh?

441
00:26:58,818 --> 00:27:00,452
No man left behind's a tenet

442
00:27:00,552 --> 00:27:03,089
even a lone wolf
like me believes in.

443
00:27:03,189 --> 00:27:05,825
Maybe you're a
team guy after all.

444
00:27:06,859 --> 00:27:08,728
Or maybe I'm just
looking to get home

445
00:27:08,828 --> 00:27:11,497
to torch tax dollars on
my next Pro Dev trip.

446
00:27:12,965 --> 00:27:15,267
Oh, and anyway, you know
you can't be a team guy

447
00:27:15,367 --> 00:27:18,170
if... there is no team, right?

448
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:20,172
Just take the damn
beer, dickface.

449
00:27:20,272 --> 00:27:22,441
Oh, go ahead and
drink both of 'em.

450
00:27:22,541 --> 00:27:24,110
It sounds like this might be

451
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:26,578
the last time Bravo
tastes victory.

452
00:27:27,579 --> 00:27:30,216
Oh, God. Okay.

453
00:27:31,217 --> 00:27:33,619
Hey, hey, I don't
know what to say.

454
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,755
This guy.

455
00:27:35,855 --> 00:27:37,323
Hey, hold up.

456
00:27:37,423 --> 00:27:38,991
You say something?

457
00:27:46,265 --> 00:27:47,734
Well, I know you... you wanted

458
00:27:47,834 --> 00:27:49,869
to get your little
girl one of these.

459
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:53,372
You take it.

460
00:27:59,278 --> 00:28:01,680
You know, I can't
accept a... dime piece

461
00:28:01,781 --> 00:28:03,282
from a... a douchebag.

462
00:28:03,382 --> 00:28:06,318
It's real.

463
00:28:07,353 --> 00:28:08,955
After that shit was over,

464
00:28:09,055 --> 00:28:11,457
I-I swiped it at the mall.

465
00:28:11,557 --> 00:28:13,993
Along with six more.

466
00:28:16,796 --> 00:28:18,330
Just keep it.

467
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:26,172
So close to home, and
you still look like

468
00:28:26,272 --> 00:28:28,307
you're a million miles away.

469
00:28:30,076 --> 00:28:31,556
Yeah. Yeah, I didn't
expect to be back

470
00:28:31,643 --> 00:28:33,179
on the crazy train
so soon, you know?

471
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:36,315
Tell me about it.

472
00:28:36,415 --> 00:28:39,819
Thought I was cruising
into retirement, and, uh,

473
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:42,688
next thing I know, I'm
doing E.R. under fire.

474
00:28:44,656 --> 00:28:47,659
Now, you didn't
keep me outside, uh,

475
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,805
'cause I'm at the one-yard
line on my retirement, did you?

476
00:28:49,829 --> 00:28:51,197
What? No.

477
00:28:51,297 --> 00:28:53,732
- Classic Bravo 1, if so.
- No, no.

478
00:28:53,833 --> 00:28:55,634
No way. It's just...

479
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:57,703
Just, uh, everything
happened so fast,

480
00:28:57,804 --> 00:29:00,106
felt more like my
first op than my last.

481
00:29:01,107 --> 00:29:05,077
Part of you wish you had
stuck to triage with me,

482
00:29:05,177 --> 00:29:06,813
kept your ass out of the fight?

483
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:12,985
What's that mean?

484
00:29:13,986 --> 00:29:15,922
I heard you had a close call

485
00:29:16,022 --> 00:29:18,324
Drew sniped you out of.

486
00:29:19,325 --> 00:29:21,760
Not how it went down?

487
00:29:21,861 --> 00:29:23,896
Guy had me dead to rights.

488
00:29:23,996 --> 00:29:26,098
That'll rattle anybody.

489
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:31,070
Yeah, yeah. That close call spun
me out for a minute, I guess.

490
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:33,405
You'll shake it off.

491
00:29:33,505 --> 00:29:35,507
Nothing you haven't done
a hundred times before.

492
00:30:02,268 --> 00:30:04,103
It was such a nice
surprise hearing from you.

493
00:30:04,203 --> 00:30:08,607
So, your, um... your new post
in Acquisition and Sustainment

494
00:30:08,707 --> 00:30:10,877
includes weekend
work in Vah Beach?

495
00:30:10,977 --> 00:30:12,544
This trip is strictly social.

496
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:14,546
Speaking of new
jobs, how's yours?

497
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:17,216
Let's just say that
it's making me nostalgic

498
00:30:17,316 --> 00:30:19,218
for some of our old arguments.

499
00:30:19,318 --> 00:30:20,887
Funny to think we
were on opposite sides

500
00:30:20,987 --> 00:30:23,422
of a policy debate and
somehow both wrong.

501
00:30:24,756 --> 00:30:27,126
Integrated deterrence feels
like the right compromise.

502
00:30:27,226 --> 00:30:28,794
You want to tell
my coworkers that?

503
00:30:28,895 --> 00:30:30,572
If they're like me,
they're more afraid of you

504
00:30:30,596 --> 00:30:31,998
than you are of them.

505
00:30:32,098 --> 00:30:33,765
But you need a
favor, I'm your guy.

506
00:30:33,866 --> 00:30:36,068
Well, thank you. I
will keep that in mind.

507
00:30:36,168 --> 00:30:38,504
Actually, one of the
reasons I reached out.

508
00:30:38,604 --> 00:30:40,272
I need a favor.

509
00:30:40,372 --> 00:30:43,475
Uh, you remember that file I got
you about an ODA tic in Mali?

510
00:30:43,575 --> 00:30:45,511
Yeah.

511
00:30:45,611 --> 00:30:46,971
Army CID's
investigating an assault

512
00:30:47,013 --> 00:30:48,280
on the battlespace commander.

513
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:50,782
- Colonel Decker?
- He's a general now.

514
00:30:50,883 --> 00:30:52,784
But, yeah. Apparently,
the assailant was looking

515
00:30:52,885 --> 00:30:54,786
for payback for a
security failure, so,

516
00:30:54,887 --> 00:30:57,289
CID's looking into all
actions he was involved in,

517
00:30:57,389 --> 00:30:59,791
going through with
a fine-toothed comb,

518
00:30:59,892 --> 00:31:02,494
see if anybody had
a beef with him.

519
00:31:02,594 --> 00:31:04,796
Do you think there's
something in that file?

520
00:31:04,897 --> 00:31:06,808
I don't know. The man's
served for almost two decades.

521
00:31:06,832 --> 00:31:08,567
Just trying to cover my own ass.

522
00:31:08,667 --> 00:31:10,669
Look, I doubt CID will
ask you about a file

523
00:31:10,769 --> 00:31:12,438
you requested through
proper channels,

524
00:31:12,538 --> 00:31:16,175
but if they do, you mind

525
00:31:16,275 --> 00:31:18,911
not mentioning that you were
dissatisfied with the results

526
00:31:19,011 --> 00:31:20,712
and I cut some red tape for you?

527
00:31:22,949 --> 00:31:24,583
My lips are sealed.

528
00:31:25,584 --> 00:31:26,986
Thank you.

529
00:31:39,765 --> 00:31:42,634
Definitely prefer this
reintegration routine

530
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:44,470
to burritos.

531
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:46,172
Well, okay, burritos
don't apply, okay?

532
00:31:46,272 --> 00:31:47,573
FID was not a mission.

533
00:31:47,673 --> 00:31:49,341
What?! What?

534
00:31:49,441 --> 00:31:52,244
Putting down an extremist
attack doesn't qualify as an op?

535
00:31:52,344 --> 00:31:55,781
Well, let's just say that,
uh, we got lucky, you know?

536
00:31:55,881 --> 00:31:58,017
- Right place, right time.
- Lucky?

537
00:31:58,117 --> 00:32:01,353
Most action you've seen
lately was on that trip

538
00:32:01,453 --> 00:32:03,522
through Central
Virginia's wine country.

539
00:32:03,622 --> 00:32:05,800
Yeah, and what did I end up
with? Beer-of-the-month club.

540
00:32:05,824 --> 00:32:07,859
Should have just
gotten the T-shirt.

541
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,395
So it wasn't rough, then,

542
00:32:09,495 --> 00:32:11,397
getting thrown back in

543
00:32:11,497 --> 00:32:13,699
and having to switch
gears so quickly?

544
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:15,334
Was like riding a bike.

545
00:32:16,335 --> 00:32:18,537
It was. I'll tell you what.

546
00:32:18,637 --> 00:32:20,672
- Let's get back into...
- Mmm.

547
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:23,142
This reintegration
process, shall we?

548
00:32:23,242 --> 00:32:24,743
Oh!

549
00:32:28,014 --> 00:32:31,717
Cerby, bed. Go to bed. Bed.

550
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,622
Saved hundreds of
innocent lives, and yet

551
00:32:36,722 --> 00:32:39,791
we are back to doggy day care.

552
00:32:39,891 --> 00:32:41,360
Well, I hate to admit it,

553
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:44,096
but after that close
call with the VBIED...

554
00:32:45,064 --> 00:32:47,666
a few more weeks of briefcase
duty doesn't sound so bad.

555
00:32:48,667 --> 00:32:50,369
You guys up for
hitting the Bulkhead?

556
00:32:50,469 --> 00:32:51,803
Wish I could, but, uh,

557
00:32:51,903 --> 00:32:54,240
I should get home.

558
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:55,674
Yeah.

559
00:32:55,774 --> 00:32:57,443
I get the urge to
hold your babies

560
00:32:57,543 --> 00:32:58,620
after what we went through.

561
00:32:58,644 --> 00:33:00,079
I've gotten so used to, uh,

562
00:33:00,179 --> 00:33:02,548
what the future with
them's gonna be like,

563
00:33:02,648 --> 00:33:05,417
I almost forgot that war
likes to have the last word.

564
00:33:06,852 --> 00:33:07,953
You boys have fun.

565
00:33:08,054 --> 00:33:09,921
- Later, Ray.
- All right, buddy.

566
00:33:10,022 --> 00:33:11,890
And then there
were two... unless

567
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,359
- you want to call Brock?
- Yeah.

568
00:33:13,459 --> 00:33:14,869
Nah, you and the
Radio City Brockettes

569
00:33:14,893 --> 00:33:16,228
are on your own.

570
00:33:16,328 --> 00:33:18,930
See, I have to, uh,
FaceTime Leanne,

571
00:33:19,031 --> 00:33:22,634
make sure that, uh, she ain't
calling anybody else Daddy.

572
00:33:22,734 --> 00:33:24,236
Then I got to call Stella.

573
00:33:24,336 --> 00:33:26,214
Oh, give her the good news,
we got pulled back early,

574
00:33:26,238 --> 00:33:27,849
and you can go support
her at Ben's hearing?

575
00:33:27,873 --> 00:33:29,351
Uh, no, there's actually
a change of plans.

576
00:33:29,375 --> 00:33:30,842
She had to head
back to her folks'

577
00:33:30,942 --> 00:33:33,245
and help her pops recover
from knee surgery,

578
00:33:33,345 --> 00:33:36,615
so she ended up just
sending his lawyer a letter.

579
00:33:36,715 --> 00:33:39,017
- Well, you're off the hook.
- Yeah.

580
00:33:39,118 --> 00:33:41,019
It's probably best that way.

581
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:45,124
You know, I'd rather eat a
bug than see Ben right now.

582
00:33:45,224 --> 00:33:46,725
I thought you didn't blame him?

583
00:33:47,726 --> 00:33:49,495
All I know is, Clay's gone.

584
00:33:49,595 --> 00:33:52,164
You know, between the shore duty

585
00:33:52,264 --> 00:33:54,966
and Drew's doomsaying,

586
00:33:55,067 --> 00:33:56,768
uh, I just feel like

587
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:59,271
Bravo is slipping
in the rearview.

588
00:33:59,371 --> 00:34:01,573
Oh, don't let Drew
get in your head.

589
00:34:01,673 --> 00:34:03,175
Even if he was on the level,

590
00:34:03,275 --> 00:34:04,715
you've got to wonder
about a team guy

591
00:34:04,776 --> 00:34:06,812
who doesn't want teammates.

592
00:34:06,912 --> 00:34:09,948
Yeah. Clay always said,
"We all need teammates."

593
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:13,018
He was right.

594
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:14,986
Man was not meant
to tarry alone.

595
00:34:15,087 --> 00:34:17,189
What the hell's that mean?

596
00:34:17,289 --> 00:34:19,291
Ah, it's just that, seems like

597
00:34:19,391 --> 00:34:21,660
Clay walked that talk
even outside the teams.

598
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,163
Like what he was
trying to do for Ben?

599
00:34:37,309 --> 00:34:39,745
What the fuck?

600
00:34:39,845 --> 00:34:42,514
Sorry.

601
00:34:42,614 --> 00:34:44,150
Are you all right?

602
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:46,418
It's been months since
you had a night terror.

603
00:34:46,518 --> 00:34:48,820
No, I'm all right.
I'm good. I'm good.

604
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,556
No. No, clearly you're not.

605
00:34:50,656 --> 00:34:53,192
It was just a dream. It
was just a bad dream.

606
00:34:55,794 --> 00:34:57,696
I'm good. Just go back
to bed, all right?

607
00:35:26,792 --> 00:35:29,127
Hope everyone had
a good weekend.

608
00:35:35,567 --> 00:35:37,169
Lieutenant Commander
Kirkpatrick,

609
00:35:37,269 --> 00:35:40,071
you're back. So this means
you've set aside your doubts

610
00:35:40,172 --> 00:35:42,073
about my fitness to
lead this initiative

611
00:35:42,174 --> 00:35:43,709
or about the initiative itself.

612
00:35:43,809 --> 00:35:45,553
Or you know how important
this is to Admiral Rivas

613
00:35:45,577 --> 00:35:47,045
and don't want to
run afoul of him.

614
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:48,785
Well, you don't rise
as quickly as you did

615
00:35:48,847 --> 00:35:50,816
without understanding politics.

616
00:35:50,916 --> 00:35:53,785
Great. So let's talk politics.

617
00:35:54,953 --> 00:35:58,089
I get that you all think
we're wasting our time.

618
00:35:58,190 --> 00:35:59,925
But here's the thing...

619
00:36:00,025 --> 00:36:01,927
SOCOM gave us one job to do,

620
00:36:02,027 --> 00:36:04,162
find a joint op with
an external partner.

621
00:36:04,263 --> 00:36:05,564
We don't do that,

622
00:36:05,664 --> 00:36:07,733
it makes it that much
harder for Captain Walch

623
00:36:07,833 --> 00:36:09,635
to fight for DEVGRU's
share of the pie.

624
00:36:09,735 --> 00:36:11,870
I'm not willing to
let that happen.

625
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:14,373
So I'm picking an op,
with or without you.

626
00:36:19,745 --> 00:36:22,648
If it matters, I'm a person
that shares credit for success

627
00:36:22,748 --> 00:36:24,716
and takes full
blame for failure.

628
00:36:51,176 --> 00:36:52,536
I understand your
client would like

629
00:36:52,578 --> 00:36:55,113
to make a statement before
I deliver my ruling.

630
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:56,114
Mr. Gossett,

631
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:58,049
you may proceed.

632
00:37:13,799 --> 00:37:16,034
Just wanted to say I am...

633
00:37:16,134 --> 00:37:19,738
really sorry for everything
that happened that night.

634
00:37:22,007 --> 00:37:25,243
Someone tried to... help me,

635
00:37:25,344 --> 00:37:26,978
save me, really.

636
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,115
Paid the ultimate price for it.

637
00:37:30,215 --> 00:37:32,918
So, whatever the
court sees fit...

638
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:36,555
I deserve it.

639
00:37:37,523 --> 00:37:39,658
Thank you.

640
00:37:39,758 --> 00:37:43,161
Does anyone else want to
speak on Mr. Gossett's behalf?

641
00:37:47,966 --> 00:37:49,368
If there's no further comment,

642
00:37:49,468 --> 00:37:51,403
we'll continue with sentencing.

643
00:37:52,371 --> 00:37:54,039
To the charge of
felony vandalism...

644
00:37:54,139 --> 00:37:55,273
Your Honor.

645
00:37:59,445 --> 00:38:01,079
My name is Sonny Quinn.

646
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:05,216
Clay Spenser,

647
00:38:05,317 --> 00:38:08,954
the man Mr. Gossett
credits to saving him...

648
00:38:11,089 --> 00:38:12,591
he was my friend.

649
00:38:12,691 --> 00:38:13,792
May I speak?

650
00:38:13,892 --> 00:38:15,260
You may proceed.

651
00:38:32,611 --> 00:38:34,913
Clay was the best
friend I ever had.

652
00:38:37,082 --> 00:38:39,117
And I can't help
but stand here...

653
00:38:41,286 --> 00:38:42,320
and look at Ben...

654
00:38:43,689 --> 00:38:46,191
part of me wants to
tear him limb from limb.

655
00:38:51,663 --> 00:38:53,665
But Clay, he...

656
00:38:53,765 --> 00:38:57,235
he was a better man than
I ever dreamed of being.

657
00:38:58,203 --> 00:39:01,707
And he'd never blame
Ben for any of this.

658
00:39:02,708 --> 00:39:03,875
Both Ben and I,

659
00:39:03,975 --> 00:39:06,812
we lost our best teammate
that terrible night.

660
00:39:08,547 --> 00:39:10,081
So it is...

661
00:39:11,049 --> 00:39:12,684
it is on me...

662
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:15,987
to be the next man up.

663
00:39:17,255 --> 00:39:20,291
I'm asking the court to...

664
00:39:23,695 --> 00:39:25,731
to give Ben a second chance

665
00:39:25,831 --> 00:39:27,098
at having a good life.

666
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:30,168
Because I know in
my heart that, uh...

667
00:39:33,138 --> 00:39:35,340
well, Clay...

668
00:39:35,441 --> 00:39:37,876
he'd think he deserved it.

669
00:39:42,313 --> 00:39:44,516
So I do, too.

670
00:40:00,365 --> 00:40:01,876
So right back into
pushing papers, huh?

671
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,268
Yeah.

672
00:40:03,368 --> 00:40:05,170
This is one packet I
don't mind pushing.

673
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:06,672
- It's my retirement docs.
- Yeah?

674
00:40:06,772 --> 00:40:08,516
- Making it official right now.
- That's hard to believe.

675
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:10,075
20 years of warfighting fits

676
00:40:10,175 --> 00:40:11,743
all into that one
little single folder.

677
00:40:11,843 --> 00:40:14,079
That's quite a career, brother.

678
00:40:14,179 --> 00:40:16,982
So you, uh... are you here
to, um, deliver the smackdown

679
00:40:17,082 --> 00:40:19,317
to Command for not
reinstating you and Bravo?

680
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:21,777
I mean, I might stick around
to watch you crack some skulls,

681
00:40:21,853 --> 00:40:23,822
rearrange some furniture.

682
00:40:23,922 --> 00:40:26,157
See, man, I knew a
little taste of action

683
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:27,937
would snap you right
back into battle mode.

684
00:40:27,993 --> 00:40:29,394
No, I'm not that
guy anymore, man.

685
00:40:29,495 --> 00:40:30,996
I'm just here to
do my shore duty.

686
00:40:31,096 --> 00:40:33,264
Whatever the brass
decides to do with Bravo,

687
00:40:33,364 --> 00:40:34,800
I'm good with it.

688
00:40:37,168 --> 00:40:38,604
Wow.

689
00:40:39,605 --> 00:40:41,807
Jason Hayes giving
peace a chance.

690
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:45,944
You know what?

691
00:40:46,912 --> 00:40:48,980
All the work you've
put in on yourself...

692
00:40:51,116 --> 00:40:53,151
I'm proud of you for
how far you've come.

693
00:40:56,421 --> 00:40:57,823
Yeah.

694
00:41:06,498 --> 00:41:08,399
Yeah, man, just being
in that courtroom,

695
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:09,780
I-I don't know
what came over me.

696
00:41:09,835 --> 00:41:11,903
I just got up and
started talking.

697
00:41:12,003 --> 00:41:14,005
A door-kicking Atticus Finch.

698
00:41:14,105 --> 00:41:16,341
Whatever Batman
villain that may be.

699
00:41:16,441 --> 00:41:19,344
Hey, but seeing Ben
up there, alone,

700
00:41:19,444 --> 00:41:21,780
not even fighting for himself,

701
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:24,282
yeah, I knew Clay
wouldn't want that.

702
00:41:24,382 --> 00:41:25,984
You did good.

703
00:41:26,084 --> 00:41:27,953
Clay was there with
you, spurring you on.

704
00:41:28,053 --> 00:41:30,021
Yeah.

705
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:36,161
Ah, from a pat on the back
chased by a pain in my ass.

706
00:41:37,963 --> 00:41:38,964
You invite this guy?

707
00:41:39,064 --> 00:41:40,065
No.

708
00:41:40,165 --> 00:41:41,867
But after what we
went through together,

709
00:41:41,967 --> 00:41:43,735
- he can pull up a seat.
- I doubt he will.

710
00:41:43,835 --> 00:41:46,404
That grifter's probably
here to scam drunks or...

711
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:48,640
steal quarters from
the phone booth.

712
00:41:49,641 --> 00:41:50,909
Drew.

713
00:41:53,178 --> 00:41:54,179
Yo, grab a glass.

714
00:41:54,279 --> 00:41:55,581
It's Brock's tab.

715
00:41:55,681 --> 00:41:56,882
There it is.

716
00:41:56,982 --> 00:41:58,249
That's why you keep him around.

717
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:00,018
Nobody talks about
Brock like that.

718
00:42:00,118 --> 00:42:01,887
Well, except us.

719
00:42:01,987 --> 00:42:04,222
Why don't you pull
up a chair, big guy,

720
00:42:04,322 --> 00:42:05,957
- take a load off.
- I'm good.

721
00:42:06,057 --> 00:42:07,617
Don't want to interrupt
Throuples Night.

722
00:42:08,994 --> 00:42:12,097
A SEAL that hates
SEALs telling jokes

723
00:42:12,197 --> 00:42:14,199
that hate laughter.

724
00:42:14,299 --> 00:42:16,401
That's awesome. Awesome.

725
00:42:16,501 --> 00:42:18,036
You enjoy yourselves, boys.

726
00:42:18,136 --> 00:42:19,370
Huh?

727
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:25,543
The guy is unbelievable.

728
00:42:27,045 --> 00:42:28,346
Told you he wouldn't
sit with us.

729
00:42:28,446 --> 00:42:30,749
All this proves
is another rumor.

730
00:42:30,849 --> 00:42:33,484
Falls for every woman he sees.

731
00:42:37,522 --> 00:42:40,091
So what's so important that
you'd step into a dump like this

732
00:42:40,191 --> 00:42:42,193
instead of just telling
me over the phone?

733
00:42:42,293 --> 00:42:43,528
We have a situation.

734
00:42:43,629 --> 00:42:44,963
Sounds ominous.

735
00:42:45,063 --> 00:42:47,933
Leo can't make it to your
party in Saint-Tropez?

736
00:42:48,033 --> 00:42:49,400
Cute.

737
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:50,669
Actually,

738
00:42:50,769 --> 00:42:52,904
the family needs us
to circle the wagons.

739
00:42:56,608 --> 00:42:59,778
Remind the, uh... the
council of deadbeats

740
00:42:59,878 --> 00:43:01,980
I'm not really
into family favors.

741
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:03,414
Go ahead. Ice me out.

742
00:43:03,514 --> 00:43:04,916
Dad, too.

743
00:43:05,016 --> 00:43:06,985
But this could be your
reputation on the line.

744
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:10,288
God forbid.

745
00:43:10,388 --> 00:43:13,558
How will I ever show my
face in the vineyard again?

746
00:43:15,193 --> 00:43:16,995
There's a reporter
doing a podcast

747
00:43:17,095 --> 00:43:18,463
about "the House of Franklin."

748
00:43:18,563 --> 00:43:20,341
- Mm.
- She's digging into the whole family saga...

749
00:43:20,365 --> 00:43:22,600
ancestors, right up to now.

750
00:43:22,701 --> 00:43:24,169
She's relentless.

751
00:43:24,269 --> 00:43:25,671
Does not hold back.

752
00:43:25,771 --> 00:43:28,774
Now, you realize
our family's a joke,

753
00:43:28,874 --> 00:43:30,208
right, Nora?

754
00:43:31,176 --> 00:43:33,511
A sex tape away from
being the Hiltons.

755
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:35,613
I still say you
have it in you, sis.

756
00:43:35,714 --> 00:43:38,016
Okay. Despite this "salt of
the earth" metamorphosis,

757
00:43:38,116 --> 00:43:39,184
you're still an asshole.

758
00:43:39,284 --> 00:43:41,319
Maybe if you guys ever
got your hands dirty,

759
00:43:41,419 --> 00:43:42,988
you'd realize there's
no reason to cry

760
00:43:43,088 --> 00:43:44,455
over a little spilled tea.

761
00:43:44,555 --> 00:43:45,733
We can only aspire
to be like you

762
00:43:45,757 --> 00:43:47,292
and have so very little to lose.

763
00:43:48,694 --> 00:43:49,761
Until then,

764
00:43:49,861 --> 00:43:52,397
if and when you're
contacted by her,

765
00:43:52,497 --> 00:43:55,133
help us out and do
what you do best...

766
00:43:55,233 --> 00:43:56,467
don't play ball.

767
00:44:00,405 --> 00:44:02,373
Wow. Whoa.

768
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:04,242
- Hey.
- What's, uh, what's all this?

769
00:44:04,342 --> 00:44:06,211
The Zillow listings you sent me

770
00:44:06,311 --> 00:44:08,379
- when I was in Afghanistan.
- Right.

771
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:09,948
I found a few more.

772
00:44:10,982 --> 00:44:12,583
- Mm.
- Thought we could...

773
00:44:12,684 --> 00:44:15,020
discuss them over
extra cheese...

774
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:16,354
- Right.
- Pick some,

775
00:44:16,454 --> 00:44:18,690
maybe go check 'em
out this weekend?

776
00:44:22,593 --> 00:44:23,962
Second thoughts already?

777
00:44:24,062 --> 00:44:25,697
Uh...

778
00:44:25,797 --> 00:44:28,233
No. No, it's-it's, uh...

779
00:44:28,333 --> 00:44:30,001
it's not about that. At all.

780
00:44:30,101 --> 00:44:31,536
About something.

781
00:44:34,272 --> 00:44:35,306
Um...

782
00:44:36,274 --> 00:44:38,176
The, um...

783
00:44:38,276 --> 00:44:40,311
attack that we had in Sweden.

784
00:44:41,279 --> 00:44:42,647
It, uh...

785
00:44:43,614 --> 00:44:45,717
It wasn't just
like riding a bike.

786
00:44:46,818 --> 00:44:48,996
I got a little too comfortable
sitting on the sidelines.

787
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:50,155
Like...

788
00:44:50,255 --> 00:44:51,322
way comfortable.

789
00:44:51,422 --> 00:44:52,490
A little too much.

790
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:55,426
There's no shame

791
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:58,396
in enjoying a break from
the blood and the trauma,

792
00:44:58,496 --> 00:45:00,398
life-and-death decisions.

793
00:45:00,498 --> 00:45:02,400
I mean, it's no wonder
you had a night terror.

794
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:04,469
Yeah, well, it was...

795
00:45:04,569 --> 00:45:06,071
I just put up my walls.

796
00:45:06,171 --> 00:45:08,473
Again. And...

797
00:45:08,573 --> 00:45:09,908
I'm sorry I lied to you.

798
00:45:10,008 --> 00:45:11,810
I just...

799
00:45:11,910 --> 00:45:14,045
didn't think I was
that guy anymore.

800
00:45:14,145 --> 00:45:16,047
Well, this conversation
proves you aren't.

801
00:45:16,147 --> 00:45:17,482
Yeah.

802
00:45:17,582 --> 00:45:19,326
It's just, like, all the
work that I have done lately

803
00:45:19,350 --> 00:45:21,319
on myself,

804
00:45:21,419 --> 00:45:23,721
all the TBI treatments,
focusing on you,

805
00:45:23,822 --> 00:45:26,224
focusing on my kids,
I found a balance.

806
00:45:26,324 --> 00:45:28,059
And I really liked it.

807
00:45:28,159 --> 00:45:29,460
I mean, I loved it. I...

808
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:32,397
For once, I could really see...

809
00:45:32,497 --> 00:45:35,033
or at least get a
glimpse into the future,

810
00:45:35,133 --> 00:45:36,701
what that would be like.

811
00:45:39,737 --> 00:45:41,439
But, uh, after this one op,

812
00:45:41,539 --> 00:45:44,009
I just feel like running
back into the fire.

813
00:45:45,010 --> 00:45:46,211
All that's just gonna...

814
00:45:47,245 --> 00:45:48,655
destroy the progress
that I've made.

815
00:45:48,679 --> 00:45:50,515
Everything's gonna
blow up, and...

816
00:45:53,018 --> 00:45:54,986
I'm scared about that.

817
00:45:55,086 --> 00:45:56,454
I really am.

818
00:45:56,554 --> 00:46:00,558
You've worked really hard to
swing the pendulum this far.

819
00:46:01,526 --> 00:46:03,294
Unlikely it'll swing back.

820
00:46:05,530 --> 00:46:06,431
Yeah.

821
00:46:06,531 --> 00:46:07,799
You're right.

822
00:46:16,041 --> 00:46:17,442
Right.
