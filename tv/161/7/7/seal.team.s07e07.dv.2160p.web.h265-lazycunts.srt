1
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:05,540
<i>Previously on</i> SEAL Team...

2
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:11,120
What is it?

3
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:12,510
Nothing.

4
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:15,266
Kind of "nothing" you need me
to torch if you don't come back?

5
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:16,586
Ray, just bring my burn box, will you?

6
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:19,796
I'm asking the court
to give Ben a second chance

7
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:20,876
at having a good life.

8
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:23,540
Because I know Clay...
he'd think he deserved it.

9
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:25,460
<i>This team needs Bravo 1.</i>

10
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:26,517
Yeah, well, I hope not.

11
00:00:26,541 --> 00:00:28,400
Because you're gonna
have to manage without me.

12
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:29,570
Is Mikey that bad?

13
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,016
Gonna need reconstructive surgery,

14
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,266
- so I got to be there for him.
<i>- The rumors</i>

15
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:36,866
of Bravo's demise
are greatly exaggerated.

16
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:38,300
Ain't that right, Magic Mike?

17
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:44,786
You are my priority, 100%, full attention.

18
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:45,810
Mikey.

19
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,357
What the fuck?

20
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:49,616
Michael's blood test

21
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,896
showed tranq in his system.

22
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:52,587
Tranq?

23
00:00:52,611 --> 00:00:54,536
Fentanyl mixed with Xylazine,

24
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,036
an animal tranquilizer.

25
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:57,656
<i>When I got hurt wrestling,</i>

26
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,026
<i>a-a teammate gave me some pain pills.</i>

27
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:02,596
<i>And I never used any,
but they were still in my bag.</i>

28
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:04,156
Mikey didn't know when you'd be home.

29
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:05,506
So he took one.

30
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:07,480
Why am I in the hospital?

31
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:11,230
You had to work a problem that I created.

32
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:12,946
<i>One of the reasons
why I came back home</i>

33
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:15,646
was to show that I could
finally have a balanced life

34
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:18,400
being Bravo 1

35
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:20,170
and a dad.

36
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:22,780
Well, that just blew up in my face.

37
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:26,296
Because I almost got
my son killed and my teammates.

38
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,970
I'm just starting to believe

39
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:30,670
that war does have the last word.

40
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:36,376
So, how many more days you got

41
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,870
till you hang it up forever, Ray?

42
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,676
Fourteen. Not that

43
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,776
my whole family is obsessively
counting or anything.

44
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,116
And, yet here you are, still training.

45
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:45,550
Yeah. I get it.

46
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:48,286
It's hard to pass on the chance
to peg paintballs

47
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:49,310
into Sonny's throat.

48
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:51,850
Not gonna clock out early after 20 years.

49
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:53,746
All right, good. 'Cause I will take

50
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:56,080
every ounce of that
old man wisdom I can get.

51
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,540
Come on, you can't wait
to invade his cage.

52
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:00,956
Thirstier than a Mormon in a saloon.

53
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:01,980
Hey!

54
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:05,486
The bigger surprise is casting
Drew as the third Stooge.

55
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:07,976
He's still at Shemp level,
but under my tutelage,

56
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,126
he, may... may... unlock Curly.

57
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:13,350
I'm fucking Moe, you knucklehead.

58
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:14,757
Yeah, well,

59
00:02:14,781 --> 00:02:17,156
kicking ass in Asia
cemented us as a go-to team,

60
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:18,980
and you are Bravo for the long haul now.

61
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:20,780
Bravo doesn't rebuild, we reload.

62
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:22,730
Well, all this team rah-rah,

63
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:25,640
maybe it's time Drew
claims a cage in here.

64
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,140
I'm good where I'm at.

65
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,616
Squirreling your gear in the,

66
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,340
abandoned, likely haunted,
basement of DEVGRU?

67
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,500
I don't mind the ghosts.

68
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:37,650
Understood.

69
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:42,050
Look who it is.

70
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:44,010
Big guy.

71
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:45,536
Long time no see, boss.

72
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,210
Well, just here for the muster.

73
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:50,186
How's Mikey? Torn ACL... that's rough.

74
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:52,286
With that Hayes grit, he's
probably kicking doors already.

75
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:53,310
Yeah.

76
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:56,000
Yeah, his knee's, you know,
it's coming along.

77
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:59,740
So, I heard you guys had
one hell of a last op?

78
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:02,410
Young guns made it through
the fire all on their own.

79
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:05,180
Look, I'm sorry
I left you guys all exposed.

80
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:07,246
- You kidding me, man?
- It was good for the underlings

81
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,190
to get their hands dirty, you know?

82
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:12,130
Besides, you were taking care
of more important things.

83
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:14,776
Weren't you? Like your son. Okay?

84
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,800
All right?

85
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:37,990
This way, Dad.

86
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:40,390
Right behind you, baby girl.

87
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:44,980
You put these here all wrong.

88
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:48,880
I was just distracted by all
the progress you and Mom made.

89
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:53,626
Seems like you wanted

90
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,510
to do it as fast as possible.

91
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,266
You know what, I'm gonna
go grab the other boxes

92
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:00,636
and try to limit my collateral damage.

93
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:01,710
- Okay?
- Okay.

94
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:03,950
Your daughter's working me hard.

95
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,930
She is so excited to have you here.

96
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:08,610
To keep having you here.

97
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,760
It's gonna be quite a change.

98
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,650
Can you believe it?

99
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,350
Two weeks and our "tomorrow"
finally begins.

100
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:19,110
Everything we've been waiting for.

101
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:23,880
How's it going, hon?

102
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,500
Good. Just finishing this one.

103
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:33,216
Sorry, I lost you for a second there.

104
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,860
Can you just say that one more time?

105
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:37,446
Hi.

106
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:38,670
Right, okay.

107
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:41,910
Great, thanks, Doctor. I appreciate it.

108
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,480
Mikey's CT results?

109
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:47,536
We're good, we're clear. There's no,

110
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,726
there's no sign of,

111
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:51,936
brain or organ damage
that, you know, leads to...

112
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:52,896
What a relief.

113
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,920
Thank God.

114
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:56,820
Right, Mikey? That's a relief.

115
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,320
No, I heard.

116
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:00,020
Only one busted head in the family.

117
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,756
Brad will be so relieved.

118
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:04,910
Assuming I ever connect with him.

119
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:06,657
I guess they don't

120
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:09,340
carve out a lot
of personal time in BUD/S.

121
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,756
- Right? She's going...
- Right, right. Right. Right.

122
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:18,986
That's right. Probably
can't remember his name, right?

123
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:20,936
After making sugar cookies all day.

124
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,916
I'd rather freeze my ass off in the Pacific

125
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:24,440
than listen to all this wedding talk.

126
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,300
Listen.

127
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:30,296
Mission success is determined

128
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,146
during mission planning. Okay, Mikey?

129
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:35,006
Hey, you know,
one family member spouting

130
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:36,920
military clichÃ©s is plenty, Mandy.

131
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:39,580
I'm gonna leave Brad a voice mail.

132
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:45,536
Time for me to run back to my hotel.

133
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,960
I may return

134
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,256
bearing pizza.

135
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,546
Right, okay, I'll...

136
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:52,016
Look, I can go and get food. Why don't...

137
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,680
No, no, you need
alone time with the kids.

138
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:56,000
Almost as much as I need a shower.

139
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:06,730
Hey, bud?

140
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:11,130
We, still need to talk, you know?

141
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,000
There's, still somebody out there.

142
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,490
Are you still chasing this bogeyman?

143
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:19,986
Right, the bogeyman
that gave your friend

144
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:21,366
the fentanyl-laced pill

145
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:23,460
- that nearly killed you.
- I told you.

146
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:25,116
Doug warned the person
that gave him the pills

147
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:26,160
to flush the rest.

148
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,566
- Who gave Doug the pill?
- Why's it matter?

149
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:31,266
It matters because he needs
to be held accountable.

150
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:33,150
What are you gonna do...
kick down his door?

151
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,650
Leave it alone, Dad.

152
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,140
I'm alive, thanks to you.

153
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,670
Mission accomplished, right?

154
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:46,590
Good. I have to show you something.

155
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,356
Got a location update on the barrels

156
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:51,006
of Chinese fentanyl precursor

157
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:53,070
that Bravo Team tagged at Heron Reef.

158
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:55,760
The barrels that landed
in Mexico three days ago?

159
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:58,376
Turns out the voyage continued
for some of the cargo.

160
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,116
One of the six tagged barrels

161
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:02,240
just landed in the port of La Ceiba.

162
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:03,450
Honduras.

163
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,806
SSE from the cartel members
that Bravo took out

164
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:09,146
indicated their bosses
in Tijuana were angry

165
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:11,636
about some shipments that
turned up lighter than usual.

166
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:14,186
Someone suicidal
skimming from a Mexican cartel?

167
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:16,580
Or the Chinese dipping
their toe into the market.

168
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,500
Attention on deck.

169
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:20,396
At ease, at ease.

170
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:23,186
Admiral Rivas. I wasn't aware
you were up from SOCOM, sir.

171
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:24,866
Had a sit-down with Captain Walch,

172
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:27,380
thought I'd see how
our DEVGRU liaison was doing.

173
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:30,236
Well, sir, having to surrender
our Chinese HVT

174
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:31,826
was a disappointing turn

175
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:33,716
for our first
integrated deterrence mission,

176
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:36,296
but we still have some
intel irons in the fire

177
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,616
that might redeem it.

178
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:40,220
From where I sit, that first
outing was already a win.

179
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,806
We gleaned hard evidence
of Beijing's involvement

180
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:45,956
in the fentanyl trade,
ammo we can use against them.

181
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:47,660
I'm thrilled to hear you say that, sir.

182
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,360
Between us, Lieutenant?

183
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:56,230
I'm heading to the Pentagon
this afternoon.

184
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:59,590
Some talk of me bumping up
to a new role.

185
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:01,570
That happens,

186
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:04,720
I'm gonna need a first-class
admiral's aide as my right hand.

187
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:08,950
Sir, that'll be a huge honor for someone.

188
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:12,436
I don't want someone.
I want the brilliant officer

189
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:14,560
that shepherded this program
from the start.

190
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,320
What would you think of that promotion?

191
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:20,386
Sir, it would be an absolute dream

192
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:21,820
to have that impact.

193
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:23,420
Great.

194
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:26,270
We'll talk later.

195
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:34,336
The first thing you
need to understand, Sonny,

196
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,580
is how little you understand.

197
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:37,730
Okay.

198
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:40,486
Bringing an invention to the gear market

199
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:42,135
it-it's a treacherous journey.

200
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:45,850
Sharks around every corner...
including within the Navy

201
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,436
will try to exploit you, steal your ideas,

202
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:50,060
undercut your profits.

203
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:54,810
All this shark talk, I'm gonna
have to change my underwear.

204
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,746
Lucky for you, we at
Huntley Tactical can guide you.

205
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:01,710
If we deem it worthy
of our time and energy.

206
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:03,720
Can I be frank?

207
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:06,880
Shoot.

208
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,906
Your blowout kit's a fun little notion,

209
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:12,606
but it's gonna take a heavy investment

210
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:14,640
from people who actually
know what they're doing.

211
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:18,966
I got to go to the bathroom.

212
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:19,990
Excuse me, sir.

213
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:22,900
God dang it.

214
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:29,590
Man, come on, Sonny, get it together.

215
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:34,350
They hate my med kit
more than they hate me.

216
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:36,996
Do you really think they'd endure

217
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:38,556
watching you deep-throat that steak

218
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:39,990
if they didn't see dollar signs?

219
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:40,447
Listen, man, I-I

220
00:09:40,471 --> 00:09:44,346
I stashed you back here
for answers, okay?

221
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:46,440
- And not questions.
- Well, they're negging you.

222
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:48,486
Like, trying to beat you down

223
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:50,346
then save you with a low ball offer.

224
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:53,326
I-I'd much rather they
give me a kick in the nuts

225
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:55,150
than continue with this misery.

226
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:57,196
No, they're using
the same script my old man uses

227
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:59,950
every time he gets his eye
on a new sailboat or wife.

228
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:04,336
Okay, so, wh-what... w-what
do I... what do I do here?

229
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,840
Hey, know what scares the living
shit out of people with money?

230
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:09,580
- What?
- People that aren't driven by it.

231
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,330
Let 'em know you've got
other buyers interested.

232
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:16,960
They'll get more worked up
than Omar at a T-Swizzle show.

233
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:20,290
Okay. Play hard to get.

234
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,616
Play hard to get.

235
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,846
Slap me in the face right now, do it.

236
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:24,406
- Slap you in the face?
- Slap me in the face.

237
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:25,546
- There we go.
- Kick some ass.

238
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:26,860
All right. Here we go.

239
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:31,300
Sorry about that, gentlemen.

240
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,680
I

241
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:36,400
I got another offer.

242
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,050
In the men's room?

243
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:39,610
Yeah.

244
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:42,970
Yeah, it's a... it's a military town.

245
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:45,046
You know, we think there's been

246
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:47,500
enough talk from this side of the table.

247
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:49,450
Team guy to Team guy.

248
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,260
What do you want out of this invention?

249
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:55,560
Well.

250
00:10:57,210 --> 00:10:59,550
I just want to make sure that my baby girl

251
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:04,350
she's taken care of,
no matter what happens to me.

252
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:08,280
There we go. Let's work from that.

253
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:15,576
Hey, Coach Turek. This is Jason Hayes,

254
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,626
calling you back again.

255
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:18,480
Listen, I need you to get back to me.

256
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,220
I'm trying to work a problem.

257
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:23,376
I need to, talk to you
about a few of your wrestlers,

258
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,200
Doug Mitchell being one of them.

259
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,396
I'm, trying to fix a problem here.

260
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:30,396
Can you just please give me
a call back when you can?

261
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:31,420
Thanks.

262
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:34,236
- Where are the kids?
- Mikey was going

263
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:37,260
stir crazy, so Emma took him for a ride.

264
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:40,140
Nice.

265
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:43,110
Sibling time for them
means we get to eat.

266
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:46,740
- You want a beer?
- Sure. Yeah. Beer's good.

267
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:52,226
Did I interrupt you
planning a mud wrestling match

268
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:53,870
to boost Mikey's spirits?

269
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:55,860
That was nothing.

270
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:58,160
Okay. Well

271
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,200
now I know it's not nothing.

272
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,356
I'm just trying to get in touch
with his wrestling coach, okay?

273
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:05,300
Mikey's friend's wrestling coach.

274
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:10,466
Tell me you're not going Columbo
on that laced Percocet?

275
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:13,076
I need to find out
who that pill came from.

276
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,626
- Why are you sharking?
- I'm sharking so I can nail

277
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:17,486
the fucker who's pushing that poison.

278
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:20,900
You going seek-and-destroy mode
isn't gonna help anything.

279
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,996
Well, it's gonna help me start
to work the problem, Mandy.

280
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:25,286
Taking care of Mikey,

281
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:27,390
that's the problem that you're working.

282
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:29,340
You know what?

283
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:32,636
I left deployment early
so I could come back here

284
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:33,357
and be an asset,

285
00:12:33,381 --> 00:12:35,210
but I'm nothing but a fucking liability.

286
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:37,076
It was an accident.

287
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,576
Accident was me thinking
that I could have

288
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,400
some kind of a balanced life here.

289
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:42,710
Why would you say that?

290
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:48,830
Mikey OD'ing does not condemn you.

291
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:52,540
Mikey's just a drop in the bucket.

292
00:13:03,424 --> 00:13:04,630
Heard you were looking for me?

293
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:07,306
Yes, I'm eager to run
something by you, sir.

294
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:10,396
The barrels of fentanyl
precursor that Bravo tagged,

295
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:12,466
one of them landed in Honduras.

296
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:15,286
Made me wonder what sway
that cargo was buying Beijing

297
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:16,636
in a volatile nation.

298
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:17,477
Well, it's no secret.

299
00:13:17,501 --> 00:13:19,540
China's been setting a foothold
in the region.

300
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:21,406
Gifting public works projects

301
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:22,996
everywhere from Brazil to Cuba.

302
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:25,396
Right, but Honduras has been

303
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:27,946
more resistant to their advances.

304
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:30,466
So when the Taiwanese embassy
was firebombed last month,

305
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:33,730
the Agency dug into who was
behind such a pro-China move.

306
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:35,680
It was this man.

307
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,636
Ramon Nazario.

308
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:39,646
Former Honduran Special Forces colonel

309
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:41,956
who's been living off the grid
with a guerrilla force

310
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:43,510
and a populist following.

311
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:45,676
So why is he doing dirty work for China?

312
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:48,496
Pipeline of fentanyl precursor
is a hell of an incentive.

313
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,096
Intel suggests he's had his eye

314
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,490
on overthrowing Honduran leadership.

315
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:54,980
An injection of drug money
could fuel that.

316
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,936
Is this all a windup to a pitch

317
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,880
for the next
integrated deterrence mission?

318
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,576
Guess Rivas dangling
that promotion has you

319
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,730
gunning even harder on his behalf.

320
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:06,800
Yeah, he mentioned it.

321
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:09,500
Man has an impeccable eye for talent.

322
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:13,130
Thank you, sir, but, this isn't about me.

323
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:15,416
This is about China using drug money

324
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,216
to fund a coup in our backyard

325
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,590
and how we stop it.

326
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:25,350
Hey, what are you doing back here?

327
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:27,867
Blackburn called me.

328
00:14:27,891 --> 00:14:29,211
Him and Walch want to talk to me.

329
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:32,216
Probably red ass about that
whole TBI power move we pulled.

330
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,100
I'm sure it's nothing to stress about.

331
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:37,016
- Asia put us back on the brass's good side.
- That's good.

332
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,080
Maybe we'll be heading
outside the wire, right?

333
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:42,026
Getting some old-school Bravo 1 energy.

334
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:44,546
Maybe, maybe throttle down
before you head in there?

335
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:45,570
What's-what's wrong?

336
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:48,080
Just dealing with some shit with Mikey.

337
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:54,370
Being cooped up in that,
garage apartment together.

338
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:56,656
Hayes men are bound
to bump protruding craniums

339
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:57,497
at some point.

340
00:14:57,521 --> 00:14:59,116
You'll-you'll patch things up.

341
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:01,216
You know, I'm better at breaking
things than fixing them.

342
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,896
Not like you. You got that gift, right?

343
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,660
Helping people out with Spenser House.

344
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:08,356
1,000 miles from helping anyone, Jace.

345
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:12,256
You know, the modesty thing just
gives me a fucking headache,

346
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,996
Ray, all right? Just,

347
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:16,810
be grateful that your future's sorted out.

348
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:24,730
Come on in, Master Chief.

349
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:30,016
Seems Bravo has finally made it

350
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,440
through the choppy swell
to smoother waters.

351
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:35,806
And you've more than earned
your sweat equity with me.

352
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:39,400
So, want to talk about
something personal to you.

353
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:41,020
Sir?

354
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:43,546
Your push for action on TBI

355
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:47,170
while a tad dramatic...
has been answered.

356
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:51,540
DEVGRU's creating a new position
to work full-time on it.

357
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:54,516
Someone to guide war fighters
through treatment options

358
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:57,810
and track progress
in com batting the epidemic.

359
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,000
What do you think?

360
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:02,540
Navy should've been doing this all along.

361
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:05,850
He means what do you think
about taking on this job?

362
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,790
You're passionate about the issue.

363
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:11,766
The fact that you recently
offered up your Trident

364
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:13,680
tells me you're looking to what's next.

365
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:15,850
Well, I've been reminded that,

366
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:18,540
carrying a rifle is how I make my impact.

367
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,706
Your personal experience,

368
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:23,730
your fire for protecting your brothers.

369
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:26,460
I know you could excel in this role.

370
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:31,650
Think about it, Master Chief.

371
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:35,610
And it's still the early stages,
so keep it between us for now.

372
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:38,620
Yes, sir.

373
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,380
Mark my words, boys.

374
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:46,896
Tsunamis, nuclear meltdowns,
solar flares.

375
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,316
No match for the chaos
that will be unleashed

376
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:53,060
by Sonny Quinn with cash to blow.

377
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:55,670
That's right.

378
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:56,906
All right, boys. Well, look.

379
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:58,556
The deal ain't signed yet. Okay?

380
00:16:58,580 --> 00:16:59,427
But I'll tell you what,

381
00:16:59,451 --> 00:17:02,276
if it wasn't for
Trump Drewniversity over here

382
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:04,160
schooling me through, I don't know, man.

383
00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:06,260
Like a wise man once said,

384
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:07,887
"Mo' money..."

385
00:17:07,911 --> 00:17:09,470
No problems. That's right.

386
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,065
Tell you what, we got, cash in my pocket.

387
00:17:14,089 --> 00:17:15,746
Bravo is back in swing. Come on now.

388
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:17,156
We're walking on Sonny-shine.

389
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:21,050
Look at this, he got jokes
like, Lenny Drewce.

390
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,280
You're early.

391
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,586
Caught the lone wolf
of the Franklin dynasty

392
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:35,096
yukking it up with what looks
like a tight pack of friends.

393
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,136
- Hey.
- Gonna introduce me?

394
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:39,266
Boozy soundbites are podcast gold.

395
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:40,640
They're just coworkers.

396
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:42,110
And holster that thing.

397
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:43,640
I said we'd talk about,

398
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:45,950
you know, maybe talking
about my family.

399
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,640
And we're not doing that here.

400
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,790
Come on.

401
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:58,630
Swing and a run.

402
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:06,126
Your great-grandfather built
a landmark mansion in Newport,

403
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:09,990
and you've created a home on wheels.

404
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:11,590
Come on in.

405
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:13,596
Unless you want to try a fourth bar

406
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:16,290
where we can't hear each other
over songs about trucks.

407
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:20,406
"She was a journalist,

408
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:23,076
naively looking for color for her story."

409
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:26,070
I'm not buying that scared act
from the fearless reporter.

410
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:28,146
Couple of your relatives
couldn't get me in this van,

411
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:29,400
I'll tell you that much.

412
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:40,380
So, you ever go back to Newport?

413
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:43,086
I hear that polo tournament
your family puts on

414
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:44,370
is pretty chichi.

415
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:47,750
I'll take bullets and bombs
over those uptight snobs.

416
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,160
Home can be tough.

417
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:51,746
When I go, my dad still guilts me

418
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:54,836
about not following him into
a career in cement sales, so...

419
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:57,116
No, my pops is too busy ghosting me

420
00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:00,800
to do the, you know,
"follow my footsteps" thing.

421
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:02,340
And your mom?

422
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:07,610
I thought you knew all about that.

423
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:09,740
Not from you.

424
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,540
Yeah, she took off when I was 12.

425
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:16,100
Moved to France.

426
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,110
She left me and my sister behind.

427
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:21,176
I'm sure you've heard
what some people say.

428
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,700
Fuck what they say.

429
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:26,720
All people do is hurt and disappoint.

430
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,136
No, but, hey, you know,
without that damage,

431
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:39,230
you know, I might not be

432
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:43,130
you know, intriguing enough
to get you inside here.

433
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:47,300
You sure you don't want one?

434
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:51,640
I've got nowhere to be.

435
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:03,100
I

436
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,430
I shouldn't do this.

437
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,290
Yeah. I got it.

438
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:16,300
I need to go.

439
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:31,250
Fuck.

440
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:51,130
Boys.

441
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:03,576
I refiled the intake forms again

442
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,670
and updated your seminar schedule.

443
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:06,820
Great.

444
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:10,050
Feel like taking another stab
at fixing the printer?

445
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:11,976
Based on a recent run-in I had

446
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:12,756
with an air conditioner,

447
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:14,140
I probably should stay away, baby.

448
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,540
I can help.

449
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:17,730
Let's give a nod to
child labor laws on this one.

450
00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:20,826
- Hey, Naima.
- Hey, Sonny.

451
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:22,236
- Hey, what's up, man?
- How are you?

452
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:23,500
What's up? What you doing here?

453
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,530
Hangover IV ain't on the menu.

454
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:27,390
No, actually, I brought somebody.

455
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,106
Ben, reached out to me this morning

456
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:33,390
when he got released.

457
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:35,190
And

458
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:39,546
well, I knew that you, you
guys hadn't met before.

459
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:40,980
No, we have not.

460
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:44,320
- Hello.
- Then, well

461
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:47,800
Ben, he's trying
to get his life together, and

462
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,690
he's looking for help.

463
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,760
And he needs you talking for him?

464
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:54,020
What...

465
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,520
What exactly are you
looking for here, Ben?

466
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:01,396
Was hoping to continue the progress

467
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:03,310
- that I was making before.
- And all the

468
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:05,170
the hurt that you caused

469
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:07,420
that's-that's progress?

470
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:08,930
Ray.

471
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,280
I'm sorry.

472
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,840
I know that Clay was
your friend, and I'm sorry...

473
00:22:13,930 --> 00:22:14,290
No!

474
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,186
No, if you were sorry,

475
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:17,416
you wouldn't show your face here,

476
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,886
- so get out.
- But I was trying...

477
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:19,996
Get the fuck out!

478
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:21,020
Now!

479
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:24,700
Ben. Ben.

480
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:28,490
Really?

481
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:33,040
Ray, what was that?

482
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:38,660
I got to go to work.

483
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:40,340
Of course you do.

484
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:46,896
Ray, if we're getting spun up this close

485
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,930
to your end date,
you don't have to go, right?

486
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:50,646
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

487
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:51,517
The minute Drew gets here,

488
00:22:51,541 --> 00:22:53,130
I got to get to this briefing, boys.

489
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:56,910
He's MIA.

490
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,700
Look, I've been texting Drew all morning.

491
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:01,200
Radio silence.

492
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:03,530
You think maybe he slept in
with that chick from the bar?

493
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,226
Somebody want to tell me
where the fuck Drew is?

494
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:06,816
Yeah, he was...

495
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,676
He was, he told me
he was going up to Norfolk

496
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:11,196
to get his gun serviced,
but you know how, like,

497
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:14,466
that place is like
a cell phone black hole, okay?

498
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:15,876
- Let's go.
- I tried calling him,

499
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:16,980
and all I heard was like...

500
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:28,206
Gentlemen, last time I addressed you,

501
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:30,306
I challenged you
to be the tip of the spear

502
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:32,400
rather than a pain in my ass.

503
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:36,186
Well, after your work
in the Golden Triangle,

504
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:38,196
consider yourselves back at the top

505
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:39,840
of the DEVGRU food chain.

506
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,086
Lieutenant Davis is here to brief you

507
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:44,690
on a joint SOCOM-CIA mission.

508
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,560
Where's Franklin?

509
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:49,310
Stuck on a gear run, sir, we'll fill him in.

510
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:53,936
Thanks to Bravo's efforts
in the Golden Triangle,

511
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:56,696
we have a working theory
that fentanyl precursors

512
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,916
trafficked by the Beijing-backed
Sai Lou syndicate

513
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:00,830
have been funneled to this man.

514
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:03,626
Ramon Nazario.

515
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:05,726
Former Honduran Army colonel who ran

516
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:08,246
their elite Spec Ops unit, Los Panteras,

517
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:09,596
currently believed to have designs

518
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:11,906
on a forceful overthrow
of his government.

519
00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:14,336
A coup that we suspect will be financed

520
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:15,896
by turning the Chinese chemicals

521
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:18,266
into millions on the illicit drug market.

522
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:19,290
Honduras?

523
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:21,056
I thought it was the Mexican cartel

524
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:23,036
that was pushing this toxic poison on us.

525
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:23,757
They are.

526
00:24:23,781 --> 00:24:27,236
But the more dire threat is
Nazario's potential rise

527
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:29,126
a narco-fueled Honduran head of state

528
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:31,490
who would be utterly beholden to Beijing.

529
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:34,970
Doped-up commie puppet show
right here in our backyard.

530
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:37,106
A Chinese proxy so close

531
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:40,106
to our borders would have
seismic implications

532
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:42,206
for American standing and security.

533
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:43,946
We cannot let that happen.

534
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:45,746
To that end, Bravo Team will be deploying

535
00:24:45,770 --> 00:24:47,456
to La Ceiba, Honduras,

536
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:51,056
with the mission of proving
the Chinese-Nazario connection

537
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:53,120
and potentially neutralizing the HVT.

538
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,526
We still treading lightly
like we did in Asia?

539
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:57,296
Sneak, creep and, hold fire?

540
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,526
The number of violent factions

541
00:24:58,550 --> 00:25:00,566
in the region's drug trade
offers more cover

542
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:03,830
for direct action without fear
of international escalation.

543
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:05,666
Plus, Agency assistance will help

544
00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:07,250
conceal American presence.

545
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,530
The gloves are off, gentlemen.

546
00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:13,226
- Happy hunting.
- Wheels up tomorrow.

547
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:14,250
0800.

548
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,336
All right, listen up, boys.

549
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,346
Long overdue for a little
seek and destroy here,

550
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:21,380
so let's dial it in. Got it?

551
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:23,456
Well, you sure you're even going, boss?

552
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,436
I mean, with Mikey
still at home healing up?

553
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:26,300
I'm going.

554
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,980
I know how to handle this problem.

555
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:29,007
Well, how about the fact that Drew

556
00:25:29,031 --> 00:25:30,206
didn't even show for this briefing?

557
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:32,510
He misses troop movement,
he's out. Got it?

558
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:35,220
We're on it.

559
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,720
Ray. Hold up.

560
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,960
Look, I talked to Blackburn.
You're clear to stay home.

561
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:50,390
I didn't ask you to do that. What...

562
00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:52,170
Did Sonny say something to you?

563
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:53,880
About what?

564
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,440
Nothing. Nothing.

565
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,446
Look, I'm going on this deployment.

566
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:01,466
That's still my job, okay?

567
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:03,266
Just saying, seems like things

568
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:05,150
may get a little kinetic down there.

569
00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:07,916
You say that as if
you're looking forward to it.

570
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:10,166
Ray, you know what? You're so
close to spiking the football,

571
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:11,630
I don't want you to risk everything.

572
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:16,100
I'll see you on the tarmac.

573
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:21,326
What do you mean leaving tomorrow?

574
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:23,906
They can't do that to you. Not now.

575
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:25,100
I'm still on the clock, baby.

576
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:28,796
I mean, if you're really going,

577
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:32,420
then we need to talk.
What happened with Ben?

578
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:35,090
Surprised me at the wrong moment is all.

579
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:37,856
Is it your PTS?

580
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:40,750
What? No, no. Babe, no.

581
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,760
No, that's under control.

582
00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:44,650
Because I haven't seen you
that angry since

583
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:45,766
I'm just supposed to welcome him

584
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:47,590
like he didn't get my brother killed?

585
00:26:51,970 --> 00:26:54,210
I felt ambushed is all, babe.

586
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:57,950
Sonny should've known better
than to bring him in there.

587
00:26:58,870 --> 00:27:01,420
It's exactly where Sonny
should've taken him.

588
00:27:02,410 --> 00:27:04,666
Imagine how much pain Ben must be in,

589
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:06,706
how badly he needs our help,

590
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:08,980
to step foot in Spenser House again.

591
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,290
Yeah... needing help's been
on my mind, too.

592
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:24,286
I let Bravo roll without me
on our last op in Asia,

593
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:25,360
and,

594
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,090
and they nearly got wiped out.

595
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,690
Felt like I turned my back on them.

596
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:36,250
So, by retiring, you're
abandoning your brothers?

597
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:38,750
I don't know.

598
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:44,400
But who's gonna look after them
has been weighing on me.

599
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:49,590
Look, baby,

600
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:53,820
I should not have snapped
in front of you and Jameelah.

601
00:27:55,410 --> 00:27:56,410
I'm sorry.

602
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:02,010
Can't you talk to Command?

603
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:04,920
Ask to stay home from this deployment?

604
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:10,860
I have to look after my guys.

605
00:28:13,170 --> 00:28:14,170
Until the end.

606
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:16,730
That's all there is to it.

607
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:36,090
All this is all so sudden. I'm sorry.

608
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:37,610
It's fine, really.

609
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,796
I'm glad to get back
to my friends at school.

610
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:43,430
And Brad could use some support
back in Coronado.

611
00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:46,850
We've learned to manage
without you, Dad, don't worry.

612
00:28:47,150 --> 00:28:48,176
I'll drive Mikey up

613
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,036
this afternoon
and get him settled at school,

614
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:51,560
then fly home from there.

615
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:54,440
Maybe you and Mandy could
come visit when you're home.

616
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:56,720
Burritos really are better in California.

617
00:28:57,530 --> 00:29:00,236
That sounds fun. I'll look at some dates.

618
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:02,420
I'm not sure Command's
gonna let me go this time.

619
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:03,837
You don't need

620
00:29:03,861 --> 00:29:05,546
DEVGRU's permission to come see me?

621
00:29:05,570 --> 00:29:08,540
Op tempo's picking back up.
I got to be all in all the time.

622
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:10,107
I'm sorry I took you

623
00:29:10,131 --> 00:29:11,300
away from Bravo, Dad,

624
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:14,096
but I really loved
spending so much time with you,

625
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:16,760
you know, near-death experience and all.

626
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:21,510
Look, guys, I'm.

627
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:26,690
I'm really proud of both of you.

628
00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:33,020
Everything you've had
to overcome on your own.

629
00:29:36,930 --> 00:29:37,930
I love you.

630
00:29:44,010 --> 00:29:45,010
Love you.

631
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:49,680
Hello, Drewnabomber.

632
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:52,720
Hello?

633
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:55,140
- We got movement.
- Yeah, I see him.

634
00:29:55,410 --> 00:29:56,610
Put your clothes on.

635
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:01,290
Let's go, princess.

636
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:03,870
You guys ever hear of taking a hint?

637
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:07,260
Well, we don't just watch each
other's backs outside the wire.

638
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:11,556
Well, I hope this means you got

639
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:13,800
whatever's going on out of your system.

640
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:23,430
So, you overslept, missed
the war no, Cock-a-Doodle-Drew.

641
00:30:23,610 --> 00:30:24,840
Omar and I covered for you.

642
00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:27,300
I don't recall asking you to do that.

643
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,070
You miss the troop movement,

644
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:31,776
and Jace, he's not gonna be able

645
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,090
to revive you, you understand?

646
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:36,380
Well, feels like a no-go, boys.

647
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:41,120
Would you quit fucking around?
You're gonna be there, Drew.

648
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,160
No, I'll take that action.

649
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:45,110
How much we betting?

650
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,030
What are you doing, man?

651
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,156
This self-sabotage shit, it's got to stop.

652
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:52,340
Every squad you've been with
since Echo,

653
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:54,596
you shoot yourself in the foot, get tossed.

654
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:57,020
Right about now,
when you might be settling in.

655
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:03,230
Hey, it's <i>All the President's Frogmen.</i>

656
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:06,450
It's Woodward and Bern-sonny.

657
00:31:06,650 --> 00:31:08,186
Take yourself off the team

658
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:10,460
so the team can't be taken from you.

659
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:12,100
Is that what you're trying to do here?

660
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:13,916
Psychoanalysis from the guy

661
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:16,760
whose deepest wish
is to call Jason "Mommy."

662
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:20,480
Yeah, easier to torch it all
and just run, yeah?

663
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:22,380
I've been there.

664
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:24,890
Cost me more than you can imagine.

665
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:30,560
I didn't, I didn't realize
we were measuring sob stories.

666
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:34,130
Man, I wish it were just a story.

667
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:36,730
Being a dope like you're being,

668
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:38,920
man, that cost me my son.

669
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:40,670
You do this,

670
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,466
you will regret it

671
00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:45,520
every single day.

672
00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:50,320
You be on that plane tomorrow.

673
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:59,290
Drew, look at me. Hey.

674
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,680
Look at me.

675
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:04,270
Be my worst enemy.

676
00:32:05,530 --> 00:32:06,550
Not yours.

677
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:13,900
Well, thanks for stopping by.

678
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:01,890
Ace, hang on to these.

679
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:04,170
First kill is something
worth remembering.

680
00:33:21,870 --> 00:33:22,870
Fuck.

681
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:31,170
You wanted to see me, sir?

682
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,466
I got everybody cranking

683
00:33:32,490 --> 00:33:34,510
on those target packages for Bravo's trip.

684
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,246
It's not what I called you here for.

685
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:38,590
We need to talk, it's

686
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,360
regarding your future.

687
00:33:40,930 --> 00:33:42,496
You mean my potential opportunity

688
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,626
with Admiral Rivas? I hope you know that

689
00:33:44,650 --> 00:33:46,756
I would have discussed this with
you when the time was right.

690
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:49,606
- No, it's not that.
- As much as I'd miss serving here,

691
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:51,376
the chance to work
at that level in the Pentagon

692
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,206
is something I can't pass up.

693
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:55,540
And frankly, sir

694
00:33:56,650 --> 00:33:59,020
it's a role that
would mean everything to me.

695
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:01,780
It's a career-maker, no doubt.

696
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,150
But listen.

697
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:07,450
You should close the door.

698
00:34:23,170 --> 00:34:25,659
We're just gonna ignore
what's going on with you?

699
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:27,615
- Let's not do this right now.
- Okay.

700
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:28,860
Let's not do this, I...

701
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:32,346
Right, so you're already
back to: Your mission

702
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:33,546
and your men come first.

703
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:34,715
You know what, I cannot bring

704
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:36,905
all of this outside the wire with me.

705
00:34:36,929 --> 00:34:37,597
Not now.

706
00:34:37,621 --> 00:34:39,989
I thought you weren't that guy anymore.

707
00:34:41,010 --> 00:34:42,726
So your fear that operating

708
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:44,166
again would destroy

709
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:45,726
all the progress you've made,
you're telling me

710
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:47,346
- that came true?
- Actually, all the work

711
00:34:47,370 --> 00:34:49,506
that I have done has
actually helped me get over

712
00:34:49,530 --> 00:34:51,150
what's happened to me, Mandy.

713
00:34:55,590 --> 00:34:56,590
But not

714
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,450
not what you've inflicted on others.

715
00:35:03,090 --> 00:35:06,036
Well, that's why the night
terrors are back haunting you?

716
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:07,986
Look, it's not haunting.

717
00:35:08,010 --> 00:35:10,770
It is just reminding me

718
00:35:10,950 --> 00:35:12,516
who I am, what I've become,

719
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:14,460
and what I have fucking done.

720
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,950
It's the same dream over and over.

721
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:24,906
You know, clearing a house
in Sangbor, Afghanistan.

722
00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:26,610
It's the early days of the war.

723
00:35:27,930 --> 00:35:29,670
Dime-a-dozen HVTs

724
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:33,410
hit our convoy the day before.

725
00:35:34,610 --> 00:35:35,870
It was my first kill.

726
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:42,110
Took his prayer beads like
it was some kind of a trophy.

727
00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:46,430
Little did I know how much shame
that would bring to me.

728
00:35:48,050 --> 00:35:49,050
What shame?

729
00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:53,910
The killings.

730
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:56,930
Just... all the killings.

731
00:35:58,100 --> 00:35:59,900
In service of your country.

732
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,320
There's no shame in that.

733
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:07,490
There's a reason why
executioners wear masks.

734
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:09,860
I am contaminated.

735
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:13,646
How did Emma and Mikey turn out
so great, then,

736
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:15,506
if you're so toxic?

737
00:36:15,530 --> 00:36:16,940
Because of their mother.

738
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:20,606
Friends, you know, schools they went to.

739
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:23,480
You know, the one time I tried
to come back and be a parent,

740
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:24,660
the one time

741
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:28,166
Mikey almost gets killed.

742
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:31,066
Everything that is good in them
does not come from me.

743
00:36:31,090 --> 00:36:32,536
Only a few weeks ago,

744
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:35,296
you saw a life for yourself
after operating.

745
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:37,966
And now you're itching
to run back into the fire.

746
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:39,670
Why? What's that gonna help?

747
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:43,030
Yeah, fire is where I belong.

748
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:46,390
Nothing more to say.

749
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,130
I got to do what I got to do.

750
00:37:04,867 --> 00:37:06,300
Damn it.

751
00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:10,060
<i>- This is Drew. Leave a message.</i>
- Hey, anything for Drew?

752
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:11,860
- No.
- Man.

753
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:13,906
Should've frog-marched
his self-destructive ass here

754
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:14,897
when we had the chance.

755
00:37:14,921 --> 00:37:16,660
Yeah. Hey, Davis?

756
00:37:17,650 --> 00:37:19,810
What's got you slumming
with the unwashed masses?

757
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,696
Blackburn thought I should be present

758
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,970
to keep Bravo's eye
on strategic objectives.

759
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:26,626
So, SOCOM agreed.

760
00:37:26,650 --> 00:37:29,710
Hitching with us below
a shooting star like yourself?

761
00:37:30,590 --> 00:37:31,880
Just doing what I'm ordered.

762
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:39,416
Longer we wait
to tell Jason we lost Drew,

763
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,390
the bigger the blast radius is gonna be.

764
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:43,310
Well, you want to be 2IC, right?

765
00:37:43,610 --> 00:37:45,800
So now's the time. Have at it.

766
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:47,696
No fucking way.

767
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:50,036
Look, he associates you
with disappointment already.

768
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:51,116
This is your rodeo.

769
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:53,486
You are going first
through every damn door

770
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:55,280
we hit when we get there,
you understand?

771
00:37:57,950 --> 00:37:59,006
I know you tried to talk me out of it,

772
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:00,230
but I still got a job to do.

773
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:02,090
I don't need an explanation, Ray.

774
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:06,260
Hey, Jace, can I talk to you for a sec?

775
00:38:06,290 --> 00:38:08,000
- What?
- Okay, so look.

776
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:12,650
Drew, h-he is a certifiable...

777
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:14,600
- Spit it out, Sonny.
- Asshole.

778
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:16,196
He's an asshole

779
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:18,920
- that... we are lucky to have.
- Yeah, he is, right?

780
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:20,127
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

781
00:38:20,151 --> 00:38:21,831
- Yep, just wanted to let you know.
- Yeah?

782
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:25,400
You want to be a businessman, Sonny,

783
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:27,260
learn to spot a bluff.

784
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:29,237
Wow.

785
00:38:29,261 --> 00:38:31,696
That's so funny, Drew. Funny guy.

786
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:33,080
- This fucking guy.
- Unbelievable.

787
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:46,426
Squeezing in one last sun-soaked trip

788
00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:47,650
on the government's dime?

789
00:38:48,850 --> 00:38:50,440
Yeah, something like that.

790
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:54,640
Look, Sonny.

791
00:38:56,530 --> 00:38:57,730
I'm sorry I got ugly with Ben.

792
00:38:58,990 --> 00:39:01,870
I probably should've given you
a heads-up, you know?

793
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:06,010
But, hey, St. Ray is allowed
a stumble or two.

794
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:12,080
Way you've been able
to support Ben in spite of

795
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:14,480
everything.

796
00:39:15,850 --> 00:39:17,200
I ain't the one wearing the halo.

797
00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:22,006
Listen, man, you're gonna get
a thousand more chances

798
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:23,140
to help guys like Ben.

799
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:25,580
And you will.

800
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:28,460
'Cause that's the kind of guy
you are, Ray. Right?

801
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:30,640
Yeah, right.

802
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:49,236
Property was seized
in a cartel sting a decade back.

803
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:50,676
CIA bought it through a front,

804
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:53,706
so, goes without saying,
we need to keep a low profile

805
00:39:53,730 --> 00:39:55,380
even in the safe house.

806
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:57,060
The late booger sugar era

807
00:39:57,510 --> 00:39:59,100
with Scarface-ian touches.

808
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:00,670
It's tasteful.

809
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:02,910
El Rojo.

810
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:05,586
This must be the dethroned kingpin

811
00:40:05,610 --> 00:40:07,356
whose gold toilets we'll be using.

812
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:08,736
A gangster fueled

813
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:12,150
by cocaine and hubris
instead of the Chinese state.

814
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:14,220
Simpler times.

815
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:17,010
I'll take throwback commando action

816
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:19,470
for O.G. Bravo's last ride.
What do you say, Jace?

817
00:40:19,890 --> 00:40:22,056
Well, if you're banging this
whole "Bravo is dying" drum,

818
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,136
I just don't want to hear it, Sonny.

819
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:24,037
I'm not. I'm not.

820
00:40:24,061 --> 00:40:25,656
Okay, look, I was wrong about that.

821
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,566
You know, even with Ray leaving

822
00:40:27,590 --> 00:40:31,226
and-and... and you realizing
you can't do this forever,

823
00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:34,010
I'm... I'm gonna be okay with that.

824
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:36,356
The next men up... they will hold the line.

825
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:38,426
I'm just glad that you got
something else to hold on to

826
00:40:38,450 --> 00:40:39,450
other than your trident.

827
00:40:40,370 --> 00:40:43,316
"Osman 'El Rojo' Garcia
was an especially feared figure

828
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:44,876
"in the Central American drug trade.

829
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:48,266
"A ruthless, bloodthirsty man
who torched his enemies,

830
00:40:48,290 --> 00:40:50,726
"took no prisoners,
and mowed down anything

831
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:52,076
that got in his way."

832
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:53,570
Whatever gets the job done.

833
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:16,160
- Move, move, move.
- Fuck.

834
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:32,800
All clear in here.

835
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:34,590
- Fuck.
- Nothing?

836
00:41:50,490 --> 00:41:51,007
Target clear.

837
00:41:51,031 --> 00:41:52,080
I got nothing.

838
00:41:52,530 --> 00:41:54,150
Dry hole after dry hole.

839
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:56,220
What are we hitting next?

840
00:41:56,610 --> 00:41:58,090
How about we catch our breath, Jason?

841
00:41:58,320 --> 00:41:59,880
How about we find another target, okay?

842
00:42:00,390 --> 00:42:01,390
Let's go.

843
00:42:05,490 --> 00:42:06,906
Trackers on the fentanyl chemicals

844
00:42:06,930 --> 00:42:09,666
you tagged in Asia are still offline.

845
00:42:09,690 --> 00:42:11,526
Right. And we're 0-for-fucking-6

846
00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:13,146
on supposed drug-trade targets.

847
00:42:13,170 --> 00:42:15,126
Well, we can't start tying
the Chinese fentanyl

848
00:42:15,150 --> 00:42:16,236
to our would-be insurrectionist

849
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:17,706
until we actually get a whiff
of the product.

850
00:42:17,730 --> 00:42:18,846
Well, seems
the product might have come

851
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:20,196
with a lesson in trade craft.

852
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:22,500
Local traffickers
are a step ahead of our intel.

853
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:25,530
All right, look,
what are these places here?

854
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:27,476
Potential stash houses.

855
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:29,870
Shots in the dark as shaky
as the ones we've taken.

856
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:32,810
We may need to wait
for more robust intelligence.

857
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:35,360
From the same Agency oracles
that got us this far?

858
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:38,810
Fuck it. Keep swinging
till we get a hit, got it?

859
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:43,040
The old "even a blind pig
can find some fentanyl" tactic.

860
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:46,280
Look, every door we kick,
we risk exposing our presence.

861
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:48,320
Came all this way for a reason.

862
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:50,480
Let's keep getting after it.

863
00:42:51,530 --> 00:42:52,580
That's a good idea.

864
00:43:30,670 --> 00:43:31,670
Blue, blue, blue, blue.

865
00:43:34,630 --> 00:43:35,630
Clear.

866
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Son of a bitch.

867
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:43,840
Fuck! Anything?

868
00:43:44,020 --> 00:43:46,066
Computers, a fucking phone?

869
00:43:46,090 --> 00:43:48,196
I got cobwebs and cucarachas.

870
00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:49,220
Fuck!

871
00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:52,930
- Jace.
- What?

872
00:43:53,410 --> 00:43:54,410
I don't want to hear it.

873
00:43:54,580 --> 00:43:56,320
- No, Jason.
- Shit.

874
00:43:59,710 --> 00:44:01,060
Place is a cash house.

875
00:44:02,170 --> 00:44:03,826
Wait, that's at least a million right here.

876
00:44:03,850 --> 00:44:05,080
It could be in all the walls.

877
00:44:05,230 --> 00:44:06,616
Whoever's banking here isn't gonna

878
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:08,260
leave it unattended for long.

879
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:12,011
We need to set up surveillance
outside for when they show.

880
00:44:12,610 --> 00:44:14,146
Finally get ourselves some leads
to chase.

881
00:44:14,170 --> 00:44:15,220
Fuck chasing 'em.

882
00:44:16,410 --> 00:44:18,010
We'll bring 'em running to us.

883
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:19,270
Look at that.

884
00:44:35,610 --> 00:44:37,020
Let's go, boys. Move.

885
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:38,580
Time to light her up.

886
00:44:39,150 --> 00:44:40,326
Is anyone gonna get judgy

887
00:44:40,350 --> 00:44:42,900
if I duffel-bag my baby's girl's
college fund right here?

888
00:44:44,910 --> 00:44:45,910
Let's go.

889
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:48,750
Let's fucking roll, come on, move.

890
00:45:03,930 --> 00:45:05,706
We got two hidden cams
and a cell phone sniffer

891
00:45:05,730 --> 00:45:07,410
all wired here to be left in place.

892
00:45:07,860 --> 00:45:09,426
The feed'll route back to the safe house.

893
00:45:09,450 --> 00:45:12,300
We can start clocking faces, vehicles,

894
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:14,370
cell phones of anyone who shows up.
