00:00:03,687 --> 00:00:06,145
-以前的onSEAL团队...-他们会活捉她.
- Previously onSEAL Team... - They're gonna take her alive.

2
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:08,737
一定是这样的!
It's the way it must be!

3
00:00:08,762 --> 00:00:10,895
我们不能告诉你我们对你的损失有多抱歉。
We can't tell you how sorry we are for your loss.

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:13,270
我们明天将被撤回美国。
We're getting pulled back to the States tomorrow.

5
00:00:13,491 --> 00:00:15,710
你要离开我们？你不是战士。
You are leaving us? You're no warriors.

6
00:00:15,754 --> 00:00:17,645
先生们，我知道你们的脚几乎没有碰过
Gentlemen, I realize your feet have barely touched

7
00:00:17,669 --> 00:00:19,296
这里的地面，但你会旋转起来。
the ground here, but you'll be spinning up.

8
00:00:19,321 --> 00:00:21,562
你的任务仍然是抓获/杀死贾马尔·亚西里。
Your mission remains a capture/kill of Jamar Yasiri.

9
00:00:21,586 --> 00:00:23,588
此外，您将收集任何情报
Additionally, you will be gathering any intel

10
00:00:23,631 --> 00:00:26,069
这可能有助于揭露一个更强大的实体。

11
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:28,027
欢迎，嗨，进来吧。
Welcome, hi, come on in.

12
00:00:28,071 --> 00:00:30,049
太多的人离开战场相信

13
00:00:30,073 --> 00:00:32,094
他们永远不会动摇他们所看到和所做的事情。
they'll never shake the things they've seen and done.

14
00:00:32,118 --> 00:00:34,555
你知道，这个地方是为了帮助像我们这样的人。
You know, this place is to help guys like us.

15
00:00:34,599 --> 00:00:36,122
布拉沃队，什么不幸

16
00:00:36,166 --> 00:00:37,689
你回来伤害我们了吗？
have you returned to inflict upon us?

17
00:00:37,732 --> 00:00:39,169
我们回来干掉亚西里。
We came back to take out Yasiri.

18
00:00:39,212 --> 00:00:40,866
在他的手下杀了我们的指挥官几周后？
Weeks after his men killed our commander?

19
00:00:40,909 --> 00:00:43,956
据说，一些被摧毁的ISIS
Word is, some of the ISIS whose compound was destroyed

20
00:00:43,999 --> 00:00:46,132
可能知道亚西里的位置。
might know the location of Yasiri.

21
00:00:46,176 --> 00:00:48,700
贾马尔·亚西里，沙姆旅，你认识这个人吗？
Jamar Yasiri, al-Sham Brigade, do you know this man?

22
00:00:48,743 --> 00:00:50,547
在这里，我以为你是来道歉的
And here, I thought you were coming to apologize

23
00:00:50,571 --> 00:00:52,375
关于迫使我进入这个地方的无人机。
about the drones that forced me into this place.

24
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:53,966
是亚西里的无人机。
It was Yasiri's drones.

25
00:00:54,009 --> 00:00:56,447
亚西里是我们的敌人，就像他是你的一样。
Yasiri is our enemy just like he's yours.

26
00:01:00,103 --> 00:01:01,191
头奖。
Jackpot.

27
00:01:01,234 --> 00:01:02,888
雷，我需要确认
Ray, I need to confirm

28
00:01:02,931 --> 00:01:04,344
HVT的笔记本电脑仍然安全
that the HVT's laptop has remained secure

29
00:01:04,368 --> 00:01:05,586
在法拉第的案子里。
in a Faraday case.

30
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:07,110
保持停电，直到我能确保
Stay blacked out until I can ensure

31
00:01:07,153 --> 00:01:08,589
你没有妥协。
you haven't been compromised.

32
00:01:08,633 --> 00:01:10,001
你知道他们的武器是从哪里来的吗？
You figured out where their weapons came from?

33
00:01:10,025 --> 00:01:11,505
他们的武器，他们的资金，
Their weapons, their funding,

34
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:14,769
都是从同一个地方来的...伊朗。
it's all coming from the same place... Iran.

35
00:01:23,561 --> 00:01:25,389
-啊!-让我们他妈的看看
- Ah! - Let's fucking see

36
00:01:25,432 --> 00:01:27,260
我他妈的在这里拖了什么，嗯？
what I fucking hauled in here, huh?

37
00:01:27,304 --> 00:01:30,089
这是魔法。魔术来了。
It's the magic. Here comes the magic.

38
00:01:30,133 --> 00:01:32,918
好吧，桑尼第二个孩子的命名权。
All right, naming rights to Sonny's second-born.

39
00:01:32,961 --> 00:01:34,485
-没错.-好吧.
- That's right. - All right.

40
00:01:34,528 --> 00:01:36,878
布罗克的按摩。
A massage from Brock.

41
00:01:36,922 --> 00:01:39,707
特伦特永恒启蒙的礼物。
The gift of eternal enlightenment from Trent.

42
00:01:39,751 --> 00:01:42,101
-你不能给它定价。-不，你不能。
- You cannot put a price on that. - No, you cannot.

43
00:01:42,145 --> 00:01:44,408
好吧，我错过了什么？我错过了什么？
All right, what'd I miss? What did I miss?

44
00:01:44,451 --> 00:01:46,627
布罗克按摩。
Brock massages.

45
00:01:46,671 --> 00:01:48,151
只是炼狱的又一个扑克之夜。
Just another poker night in purgatory.

46
00:01:48,194 --> 00:01:50,109
请告诉我那是命令电话
Please tell me that was Command calling

47
00:01:50,153 --> 00:01:51,980
告诉我们我们要回去工作了。
telling us that we're going back to work.

48
00:01:52,024 --> 00:01:54,176
因为已经一个多星期了，我开始发疯了。
Because it's been over a week and I'm starting to go crazy.

49
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,768
不，是奈玛，只是一些兽医中心的东西。
No, it was Naima, just some vet center stuff.

50
00:01:56,811 --> 00:01:58,726
据我所知，
Last I heard from the brass,

51
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:00,443
他们仍在努力绕过伊朗
they're still trying to wrap their heads around Iran

52
00:02:00,467 --> 00:02:02,208
作为沙姆旅背后的力量。
being the force behind al-Sham Brigade.

53
00:02:02,252 --> 00:02:03,707
当他们包头的时候，
Well, while they wrap their heads,

54
00:02:03,731 --> 00:02:05,211
我们坐在屁股上。
we sit on our asses.

55
00:02:05,255 --> 00:02:07,518
与布罗克不同，国防部保持着他们的牌。
Unlike Brock, DoD's keeping their cards close.

56
00:02:07,561 --> 00:02:09,481
他们别无选择。我们采取行动，让伊朗
They got no choice. We make a move that lets Iran

57
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,261
知道我们知道了，事情升级了。
know we're onto 'em, and things escalate.

58
00:02:11,304 --> 00:02:12,934
你想和步兵一起开枪，
Shoot it out with the foot soldiers all you want,

59
00:02:12,958 --> 00:02:14,501
但是，当您锁定顶部时，它会着火。
but when you lock onto the top, it's hold fire.

60
00:02:14,525 --> 00:02:16,135
那部分。
That part.

61
00:02:16,179 --> 00:02:18,485
是的，是木偶大师保护木偶大师。
Yeah, it's puppet masters protecting puppet masters.

62
00:02:18,529 --> 00:02:20,226
没有人想要第三次世界大战。
Nobody wants World War III.

63
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:22,010
尤其是无辜的人
Especially not the innocent people

64
00:02:22,054 --> 00:02:23,882
在鲁莽政权的控制下。
under the control of a reckless regime.

65
00:02:23,925 --> 00:02:25,927
嗯，我看到布拉沃1
Well, I see Bravo 1

66
00:02:25,971 --> 00:02:27,668
仍然是强尼·陈的印象。
still does a mean Johnny Chan impression.

67
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:29,192
-是的.-看看这个，嗯？
- Yeah. - Look at this, huh?

68
00:02:29,235 --> 00:02:30,778
嘿，听着，听着，还有人认为
Hey, look, look, anybody else think

69
00:02:30,802 --> 00:02:34,066
杰森的头问题只是一个长期的骗局
that Jason's noggin problems is just a long con

70
00:02:34,109 --> 00:02:37,809
拿走我们所有的现金？
to take all our cash?

71
00:02:37,852 --> 00:02:40,333
嘿，你可以笑，新来的，没关系。
Hey, you can laugh, new guy, it's all right.

72
00:02:41,595 --> 00:02:43,641
你看起来确实是个纸牌鲨鱼。
Well, you do seem to be a card shark.

73
00:02:43,684 --> 00:02:45,575
也许那些爆头给了你一个美好的心灵。
Maybe all those headshots gave you a beautiful mind.

74
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:50,604
喔，在limbo呆了一周的一件好事
Whoo, the one good thing about a week in limbo

75
00:02:50,648 --> 00:02:52,215
我们是一个幸福的大家庭。
is we are one big happy family.

76
00:02:52,258 --> 00:02:53,868
我有一些副作用给你。
I got some side action for you.

77
00:02:53,912 --> 00:02:56,001
提高赌注，让它有点兴奋。
Raise the stakes, make it a little exciting.

78
00:02:56,044 --> 00:02:57,437
-好吗？-怎么了？

79
00:02:57,481 --> 00:02:59,134
一只手，头对头。
One hand, head-to-head.

80
00:02:59,178 --> 00:03:01,485
-如果我赢了，好吧...-嗯.
- If I win, okay... - Mm-hmm.

81
00:03:01,528 --> 00:03:02,877
你停止所有这些疯狂的谈话
You stop all this crazy talk

82
00:03:02,921 --> 00:03:04,575
关于几个月后退休。
about retiring in a couple months.

83
00:03:04,618 --> 00:03:07,404
现在，那是我一生中的一次，我将支持桑尼。
Now, that is one time in my life I will root for Sonny.

84
00:03:07,447 --> 00:03:09,275
-是的，是的，是的.-来吧...
- Yes, yes, yes. - Come on...

85
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:13,105
我很感激你，兄弟，但我宁愿保存我的运气
I appreciate you, brother, but I'd rather save my luck

86
00:03:13,148 --> 00:03:14,715
因为在电线外面。
for outside the wire.

87
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:16,761
嘿，我们把它和伊朗混在一起，我们需要它。
Hey, we mix it up with Iran, we're gonna need it.

88
00:03:29,948 --> 00:03:32,646
你意识到伊朗参与的发现
You realize the discovery of Iran's involvement

89
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:35,432
引发了整个战略问题的雷区
raises a whole minefield of strategic questions

90
00:03:35,475 --> 00:03:36,737
让SOCOM考虑吗？
for SOCOM to consider?

91
00:03:36,781 --> 00:03:38,086
我想我在想，先生，
I guess I'm wondering, sir,

92
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:39,542
我们属于这些考虑因素。
where we fall in those considerations.

93
00:03:39,566 --> 00:03:41,655
我们最后一次来这里，我们被拉回家了
Our last trip here, we got yanked home

94
00:03:41,699 --> 00:03:43,788
心跳加速，我们还有未完成的业务。
in a heartbeat, and we still had unfinished business.

95
00:03:43,831 --> 00:03:45,442
现在，我们的任务完成了。

96
00:03:45,485 --> 00:03:46,984
听着，如果有任何后续，让我们来看看，好吗？
Look, if there's any follow-ons, let us at 'em, all right?

97
00:03:47,008 --> 00:03:48,445
我们在这里抓墙。
We're clawing the walls here.

98
00:03:48,488 --> 00:03:50,328
墙壁仍然被十几个敌人包围，

99
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,492
包括亚西里民兵的遗骸，
including the remains of Yasiri's militia,

100
00:03:52,536 --> 00:03:54,320
他们的领袖得到了谁不高兴。
who can't be happy their leader got got.

101
00:03:54,364 --> 00:03:56,255
没有理由相信布拉沃是脆弱的
There's no reason to believe that Bravo is vulnerable

102
00:03:56,279 --> 00:03:58,324
报复性攻击。
to retaliatory attacks.

103
00:03:58,368 --> 00:04:00,979
该机构成功地推动了Yasiri的叙述

104
00:04:01,022 --> 00:04:02,633
被ISIS带走了。

105
00:04:02,676 --> 00:04:05,723
你们都很擅长编造那些谎言，不是吗？
You all are real good at spinning those lies, aren't you?

106
00:04:05,766 --> 00:04:07,377
打扰一下，士官？
Excuse me, Petty Officer?

107
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:09,572
现在，当你的故事破裂时会发生什么？
Now, what happens when that story of yours falls apart?

108
00:04:09,596 --> 00:04:11,250
我们就呆在这里接受打击？
We just gonna stay here and take that hit?

109
00:04:11,294 --> 00:04:13,600
好吧，检查一下，桑尼。来吧。

110
00:04:15,036 --> 00:04:18,039
Bravo团队将待命，直到进一步指示为止。

是的，先生。收到。

112
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:21,889
桑尼，后面是搞什么鬼？
Sonny, what the fuck was that back there?

113
00:04:21,913 --> 00:04:23,499
你为什么那样在布莱克本卸货？
Why you unloading on Blackburn like that?

114
00:04:23,523 --> 00:04:25,240
我是说，听着，你知道，他是我们的孩子，
I mean, look, you know, he's our boy and all,

115
00:04:25,264 --> 00:04:26,874
但他仍然是我们的执行官。
but he's still our executive officer.

116
00:04:26,918 --> 00:04:28,678
-你不能这么做.-我知道，我只是生病了
- You can't do that. - I know, I'm just getting sick

117
00:04:28,702 --> 00:04:31,618
厌倦了对我们马里行动的这种头头脑脑的打击。
and tired of this head-shed horseshit over our Mali op.

118
00:04:31,662 --> 00:04:33,794
好吧，这是食物链政治的重中之重
Okay, that's top of the food chain politics

119
00:04:33,838 --> 00:04:35,381
就在那里，你不能把它固定住
going on right there, you cannot pin that

120
00:04:35,405 --> 00:04:36,928
在布莱克本或德夫格鲁。
on Blackburn or DEVGRU.

121
00:04:36,971 --> 00:04:38,669
损坏的机器上的所有齿轮。
All cogs in a corrupt machine.

122
00:04:38,712 --> 00:04:40,386
不管他们藏了什么，戴维斯可能已经掉了，
Whatever they're hiding, Davis might have dropped,

123
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:42,281
但我不会，这不是阴谋，
but I won't, and this ain't no conspiracy,

124
00:04:42,325 --> 00:04:44,501
51区废话，贾斯，好吗？
Area 51 bullshit, Jas, okay?

125
00:04:44,544 --> 00:04:45,893
我们的手术发生了一些事情，
Something happened on our op,

126
00:04:45,937 --> 00:04:47,218
他们正试图掩盖它。
and they are trying to cover it up.

127
00:04:47,242 --> 00:04:49,462
我知道，我知道。我知道。
I know, I know. I know.

128
00:04:49,506 --> 00:04:51,856
我想他们也想让我参与其中。
I think they're trying to make me a part of it, too.

129
00:04:51,899 --> 00:04:54,162
你到底是什么意思？
What the hell you mean?

130
00:04:54,206 --> 00:04:56,251
我准备去马里参加海军十字勋章。
I'm up for the Navy Cross for Mali.

131
00:04:58,471 --> 00:05:01,735
我是说，那次奔跑你救了我们所有的屁股，尤其是克莱。
I mean, that run you did saved all our asses, especially Clay.

132
00:05:01,779 --> 00:05:04,564
但是他们给你奖牌的重点是你做了什么
But them giving you that medal focuses on what you did

133
00:05:04,608 --> 00:05:06,087
而不是出了什么问题。
and not what went wrong.

134
00:05:06,131 --> 00:05:07,761
没错，它把聚光灯放在我身上。
That's right, it puts the spotlight on me.

135
00:05:07,785 --> 00:05:09,787
不管烂了什么，它都停留在阴影中。
Whatever was rotten, it just stays in the shadows.

136
00:05:11,615 --> 00:05:14,748
现在，海军交叉调查，
Now, a Navy Cross investigation,

137
00:05:14,792 --> 00:05:17,447
这将跨越你的整个职业生涯，好吗？
that's gonna span across your entire career, okay?

138
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:19,318
他们可能会对你的TBI明智。
They might get wise to your TBI.

139
00:05:21,059 --> 00:05:22,626
这不是我担心的。
That's not what I'm worried about.

140
00:05:22,669 --> 00:05:24,062
你知道这是怎么回事。
You know how this works.

141
00:05:24,105 --> 00:05:26,238
勒索17，罗伯茨里奇，
Extortion 17, Roberts Ridge,

142
00:05:26,281 --> 00:05:28,240
所有那些试图得到答案的家庭，
all those families trying to get answers,

143
00:05:28,283 --> 00:05:30,068
他们无法得到真相。
and they cannot get the truth.

144
00:05:30,111 --> 00:05:33,201
国防部想埋葬一些东西，他们把它埋在八英里深的地方。
DoD wants to bury something, they bury it eight miles deep.

145
00:05:33,245 --> 00:05:34,962
这就是为什么我不会停止挖掘，好吗？
That's why I'm not gonna stop digging, okay?

146
00:05:34,986 --> 00:05:36,790
他们要对你做的调查，
And this investigation that they're gonna do to you,

147
00:05:36,814 --> 00:05:38,424
你没什么好担心的，好吧，
you don't have shit to worry about, okay,

148
00:05:38,468 --> 00:05:40,184
因为团队会像往常一样支持你。
'cause the team will have your back as we always do.

149
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:42,428
此外，布拉沃1拍了多少张照片
Besides, how many shots has Bravo 1 taken

150
00:05:42,472 --> 00:05:43,734
回家和离开？
home and away?

151
00:05:43,777 --> 00:05:45,605
其中一张照片着陆了吗？没有。
Has one of those shots landed? No.

152
00:05:45,649 --> 00:05:47,868
我有很多后果，桑尼，很多。
I've had plenty of consequences, Sonny, plenty.

153
00:05:47,912 --> 00:05:50,567
是的，现在看看你。你滚得很漂亮
Yeah, look at you now. You're rolling pretty

154
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:52,786
你九个生命中有八个半。
with eight and a half of your nine lives.

155
00:06:02,622 --> 00:06:05,451
尽管我们都发现德黑兰
As galling as we all find the fact that Tehran

156
00:06:05,495 --> 00:06:08,149
会使用代理来进行这次攻击
would use a proxy for us to carry out this attack

157
00:06:08,193 --> 00:06:10,848
在一艘美国船上，我还没有出现
on an American vessel, I'm yet to be presented

158
00:06:10,891 --> 00:06:12,545
有任何适当的回应。
with any appropriate response.

159
00:06:12,589 --> 00:06:15,156
根本没有对伊朗公开攻击的胃口。
Simply no appetite for open aggression with Iran.

160
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,419
恕我直言，上将。
Due respect, Admiral.

161
00:06:18,464 --> 00:06:20,466
我们可能有一个更具体的目标。
We may have a more specific target.

162
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:24,644
-更具体？-先生，我们的敌人是一个人.
- More specific? - Sir, our enemy is one man.

163
00:06:24,688 --> 00:06:26,777
伊朗将军阿夫辛·拉贾维。
Iranian General Afshin Rajavi.

164
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:29,170
与沙姆旅领导层的沟通
Communications with al-Sham Brigade leadership

165
00:06:29,214 --> 00:06:32,217
显示拉贾维将军正在向他们下达命令，
show that General Rajavi was giving them their orders,

166
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:34,654
供应武器，并亲自指挥
supplying weapons, and personally directed

167
00:06:34,698 --> 00:06:36,351
对克莱姆普顿号航空母舰的攻击。
the attack on the USS Crampton.

168
00:06:36,395 --> 00:06:38,547
拉贾维将军是地位最高的人物之一
General Rajavi is one of the most highly placed figures

169
00:06:38,571 --> 00:06:39,877
在德黑兰。
in Tehran.

170
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,269
为什么要弄脏他的手？
Why get his hands dirty with that?

171
00:06:41,313 --> 00:06:43,184
为了保持伊朗的清洁，先生，
To keep Iran's plausibly clean, sir,

172
00:06:43,228 --> 00:06:45,926
当他提高他们对该地区的兴趣时。
while he advances their interest in the region.

173
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:48,494
理论是，在那次袭击中使用俄罗斯导弹
Theory is, the use of Russian missiles in that attack

174
00:06:48,538 --> 00:06:50,409
是试图进一步引起我们的注意
was an attempt to further pull our attention

175
00:06:50,453 --> 00:06:52,890
远离中东前往莫斯科。
away from the Middle East toward Moscow.

176
00:06:52,933 --> 00:06:57,111
但是这种误导失败了，把我们的海豹突击队吸引到了叙利亚
But that misdirection failed, drew our SEALs into Syria

177
00:06:57,155 --> 00:07:00,506
揭露拉贾维是沙姆旅背后的人物，
and exposed Rajavi as the figure behind al-Sham Brigade,

178
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:02,769
一股现在已经退化的力量。
a force which has now been degraded.

179
00:07:02,813 --> 00:07:05,903
-这是一个闭环.-除了，先生，
- It's a closed loop. - Except, sir,

180
00:07:05,946 --> 00:07:07,731
Cramptonattack只是一次齐射
the Cramptonattack was only one salvo

181
00:07:07,774 --> 00:07:09,863
在秘密行动中
in a campaign of clandestine operations

182
00:07:09,907 --> 00:07:11,604
拉贾维在该地区发动战争。
Rajavi was waging in the region.

183
00:07:11,648 --> 00:07:13,780
在他的命令下进行的全力支持
Carried out under his orders with the full backing

184
00:07:13,824 --> 00:07:16,304
和伊朗的资源，同时给他们距离
and resources of Iran, while giving them distance

185
00:07:16,348 --> 00:07:17,958
从由此产生的流血事件中。
from the resulting bloodshed.

186
00:07:19,177 --> 00:07:20,700
我们来看看。谢谢。
We'll take a look. Thank you.

187
00:07:22,876 --> 00:07:25,749
恕我直言，先生，如果不对拉贾维采取行动，
With all due respect, sir, without action against Rajavi,

188
00:07:25,792 --> 00:07:27,577
我们乞求另一个乌克兰，
we are begging for another Ukraine,

189
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:29,361
邀请伊朗发动攻势
inviting Iran to launch an offensive

190
00:07:29,404 --> 00:07:31,537
这将改变地缘政治格局
that will change the geopolitical landscape

191
00:07:31,581 --> 00:07:32,930
一代人。
for a generation.

192
00:07:32,973 --> 00:07:36,324
现在是我们停止的机会。是他。
Our chance to stop that is now. It's him.

193
00:07:37,761 --> 00:07:40,198
我们不是在冒险进入一个主权国家
We are not venturing into a sovereign nation

194
00:07:40,241 --> 00:07:41,895
消灭一名现任将军。
to eliminate a sitting general.

195
00:07:41,939 --> 00:07:45,246
如果拉贾维像这些全球行动一样亲力亲为
If Rajavi is as hands-on with these global actions

196
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:48,685
听起来，他必须出差很多。
as it sounds, he must travel quite a bit.

197
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:51,514
有道理，先生。
Stands to reason, sir.

198
00:07:53,516 --> 00:07:56,083
如果有人能找到攻击他的角度
If someone can find an angle of attack on him

199
00:07:56,127 --> 00:08:00,914
在伊朗边界之外，没有牵连美军，
outside Iranian borders without implicating U.S. forces,

200
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:03,700
我可以看到他的绿色照明行动。
I can see greenlighting action on him.

201
00:08:03,743 --> 00:08:05,136
是的，先生。
Yes, sir.

202
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:20,934
你在那东西上摩擦得够多了，也许op精灵出现了，
You rub on that thing enough, maybe the op genie appears,

203
00:08:20,978 --> 00:08:22,501
给我们一些行动。
grants us some action.

204
00:08:25,373 --> 00:08:27,134
贾斯，你知道桑尼被命令弄得很咸
Jas, you know Sonny getting salty with Command

205
00:08:27,158 --> 00:08:28,986
不会让他们更快地任务我们
is not gonna make them any quicker to task us

206
00:08:29,029 --> 00:08:32,598
-或者带我们回家。-我和他谈过了.
- or bring us home. - I talked to him.

207
00:08:32,642 --> 00:08:34,682
你把他的屁股拧回正确的方向了？
You got his ass screwed back in the right direction?

208
00:08:35,819 --> 00:08:37,734
我刚刚意识到我的没有。
I just realized mine hasn't been.

209
00:08:39,431 --> 00:08:44,958
你知道，我一直在看着我的肩膀，
You know, I've just been looking over my shoulder so much,

210
00:08:45,002 --> 00:08:50,877
退役，奥马尔，勋章调查。
decommissioning, Omar, medal investigation.

211
00:08:52,487 --> 00:08:55,316
前两场风暴已经过去。你会经受住下一个。
First two storms have passed. You'll weather the next one.

212
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,362
好吧，我会很好地走开，
Right, I'll walk away just fine,

213
00:08:57,405 --> 00:08:59,625
当克莱、哈马尔和努里指挥官没有。
when Clay, Hamal, and Commander Nouri didn't.

214
00:08:59,669 --> 00:09:01,932
你也承担了你的责任，兄弟。
You've taken your share of damage too, brother.

215
00:09:01,975 --> 00:09:04,630
对，我每次都要继续前进，
Right, and I got to move on every time,

216
00:09:04,674 --> 00:09:07,894
而克莱只是被困在他的生活中。
while Clay is just stuck living in his.

217
00:09:09,809 --> 00:09:12,507
贾斯，生活在你的伤痛中有很大的不同
Jas, there's a big difference between living in your hurt

218
00:09:12,551 --> 00:09:14,031
和它一起生活。
and living with it.

219
00:09:14,074 --> 00:09:15,859
克莱，他做得很好。
Now, Clay, he's doing great.

220
00:09:15,902 --> 00:09:17,488
他每天都在中心付款
He's at the center every day paying forward

221
00:09:17,512 --> 00:09:18,818
你给他的支持。
the support that you gave him.

222
00:09:20,124 --> 00:09:22,169
我不需要啦啦队长，雷。
I don't need a cheerleader, Ray.

223
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:25,695
当然。
Sure.

224
00:09:25,738 --> 00:09:27,044
你需要一个目标。
You need a target.

225
00:09:28,915 --> 00:09:30,613
停机时间不是任何人的朋友。
Downtime's nobody's friend.

226
00:09:36,314 --> 00:09:39,491
好吧。我会让你去做的。
All right. I'll leave you to it.

227
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,241
嘿，本。
Hey, Ben.

228
00:09:50,284 --> 00:09:52,199
我们在小组会议上很想你，伙计。
We missed you at the group session, man.

229
00:09:52,243 --> 00:09:54,003
我们的两个人发现他们都受伤了
Two of our guys discovered they both got injured

230
00:09:54,027 --> 00:09:55,550
在收铁行动期间。
during Operation Iron Harvest.

231
00:09:55,594 --> 00:09:57,552
感人。我迫不及待想听到
Touching. I can't wait to hear

232
00:09:57,596 --> 00:09:59,946
《哭泣教练》的下一集发生了什么。
what happens on the next episode of Cry Coach.

233
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:01,513
哟，嘿。你说得好吗？
Yo, hey. You good?

234
00:10:01,556 --> 00:10:03,056
奈玛告诉我你错过了约会
Naima told me that you missed your appointment

235
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,298
昨天和V.A.
with the V.A. yesterday.

236
00:10:04,342 --> 00:10:06,170
我累坏了。
I'm exhausted.

237
00:10:06,213 --> 00:10:08,235
我以为睡在这里的床上而不是我的卡车
I thought sleeping in a bed here instead of my truck

238
00:10:08,259 --> 00:10:09,826
会有所帮助的。
would have helped.

239
00:10:09,869 --> 00:10:11,412
你还在寻找没有噩梦的睡眠吗？
You still looking for that sleep without a nightmare?

240
00:10:11,436 --> 00:10:12,761
噩梦比现实更容易处理
Nightmares are easier to handle than reality

241
00:10:12,785 --> 00:10:13,980
当我醒着躺在上午2:00
when I'm lying awake at 2:00 a.m.

242
00:10:14,004 --> 00:10:15,962
想知道我从这里去哪里。
wondering where I go from here.

243
00:10:16,006 --> 00:10:18,182
那个职业顾问有什么线索给你吗？
Well, that career counselor have any leads for you?

244
00:10:18,225 --> 00:10:20,880
李堡的设施维护
Facilities maintenance at Fort Lee

245
00:10:20,924 --> 00:10:22,534
或者大洋洲航空站。
or Air Station Oceana.

246
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,600
以为Top Gun很酷，等到你看到他们
Thought Top Gun was cool, wait till you see the guys

247
00:10:25,624 --> 00:10:27,278
治好那些家伙的混蛋。
that fix those guys' shitters.

248
00:10:27,321 --> 00:10:29,715
听着，嘿，你...你有没有想过，就像，
Look, hey, you... do you ever think about just, like,

249
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:31,543
尝试全新的东西？
trying something completely new?

250
00:10:31,586 --> 00:10:34,938
比如上学，还是试着把军队抛在脑后？
Like going to school, or just try leaving the military behind?

251
00:10:34,981 --> 00:10:36,635
让他们摆脱困境？
Just let 'em off the hook?

252
00:10:37,984 --> 00:10:40,030
-你什么意思？-他们这样对我.
- What do you mean? - They did this to me.

253
00:10:40,073 --> 00:10:42,423
我走进空军征兵办公室
I walked into that Air Force recruiting office

254
00:10:42,467 --> 00:10:46,297
被所有 “高高的目标，飞行，战斗，胜利” 的废话所点燃。
gaslit by all that "Aim high, fly, fight, win" bullshit.

255
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:48,734
嗯，我从来没有离开过地面，
Well, I never got off the fucking ground,

256
00:10:48,778 --> 00:10:51,128
打得很脏，从那以后我一直在输。
fought dirty, and I've been losing ever since.

257
00:10:52,259 --> 00:10:53,608
空军打断了我。
Air Force broke me.

258
00:10:53,652 --> 00:10:55,064
他们让我重新团结起来，
It's on them to put me back together,

259
00:10:55,088 --> 00:10:56,742
从工作开始。
start with a job.

260
00:10:56,786 --> 00:10:58,415
听着，军队更擅长破坏我们
Look, the military is a lot better at breaking us

261
00:10:58,439 --> 00:11:00,006
而不是它在修复我们。
than it is fixing us.

262
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:01,941
也许这就是为什么你最好切断联系，
Maybe that's why it's best for you just to cut ties,

263
00:11:01,965 --> 00:11:03,836
你知道，试着继续你的生活。
you know, just try and move on with your life.

264
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,664
是的，从那个给他们一条腿的人那里

00:16:57,363 --> 00:16:58,688
好吧，听着，你为什么把虫子弄死了
All right, look, why do you got the bug up your ass

398
00:16:58,712 --> 00:17:00,323
关于问责制，桑尼，嗯？
about accountability, Sonny, huh?

399
00:17:00,366 --> 00:17:02,127
记住，好吧，我们要去找那个混蛋
Remember, all right, we're going after the dirtbag

400
00:17:02,151 --> 00:17:03,804
谁带走了20名美国水手，好吗？
who took out 20 American sailors, okay?

401
00:17:03,848 --> 00:17:06,285
-所以，他妈的拨进去。-收到。
- So, dial it the fuck in. - Roger that.

402
00:17:17,949 --> 00:17:19,559
科伊在打卡。
Khoi's punching in.

403
00:17:22,301 --> 00:17:24,695
好吧。嘿，我们去工作吧。
All right. Hey, let's go to work.

404
00:17:59,121 --> 00:18:00,818
在商务休闲中汗流浃背。
Sweaty in business casual.

405
00:18:00,861 --> 00:18:03,560
我一生都是为了避免这种情况。
I built my whole life around avoiding this.

406
00:18:03,603 --> 00:18:05,736
是的。来吧。
Yeah. Come on.

407
00:19:00,356 --> 00:19:02,184
嗅探器找不到霍伊的网络。
Sniffer's not finding Khoi's network.

408
00:19:04,011 --> 00:19:06,057
布拉沃3号，我是真子1号。
Bravo 3, this is Mako 1.

409
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:08,364
HVT还在他的办公室吗，笔记本电脑在吗？
Is the HVT still in his office, laptop on?

410
00:19:11,932 --> 00:19:14,065
Bravo 3，这是Mako 1，收到了吗？
Bravo 3, this is Mako 1, do you copy?

411
00:19:17,199 --> 00:19:19,201
Bravo 3，这是Mako 1，收到了吗？
Bravo 3, this is Mako 1, do you copy?

412
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,291
可能都是同一个问题的一部分。
Might all be part of the same problem.

413
00:19:22,334 --> 00:19:24,510
站住。
Hold here.

414
00:19:24,554 --> 00:19:26,947
-我马上回来.-我会继续努力.
- I'll be right back. - I'll keep trying.

415
00:19:38,568 --> 00:19:40,134
1、你抄吗？
1, do you copy?

416
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:45,836
1、你抄吗？
1, do you copy?

417
00:19:47,881 --> 00:19:48,969
真子。
Mako.

418
00:19:50,319 --> 00:19:51,581
再说一遍，1.
Say again, 1.

419
00:19:51,624 --> 00:19:53,104
你崩溃了，但你可读。
You're broken, but you're readable.

420
00:19:53,147 --> 00:19:55,237
-怎么了？-我们有个问题.
- What's up? - We have a problem here.

421
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,215
似乎我们面临着某种信号干扰器。
Seems that we're up against some type of signal jammer.

422
00:19:57,239 --> 00:19:58,679
它扰乱了通讯和其他技术。
It's disrupting comms and other tech.

423
00:19:58,718 --> 00:20:00,938
我们可以用电脑试试变通办法，
We can try workarounds with the computer,

424
00:20:00,981 --> 00:20:03,114
但我们仍然会处于沉默的锥体。
but we'll still be in the cone of silence.

425
00:20:03,157 --> 00:20:05,377
你能把它放在你现在的地方吗？
Can you hold it where you are?

426
00:20:05,421 --> 00:20:08,293
否定的。离4太远了。
Negative. Too far away from 4.

427
00:20:08,337 --> 00:20:10,184
如果灰色西装从他附近的楼梯间弹出，
If a gray suit pops out of that stairwell near him,

428
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:11,514
他完蛋了。
he's screwed.

429
00:20:11,557 --> 00:20:12,950
如果你回到办公室，
If you go back to the office,

430
00:20:12,993 --> 00:20:14,560
你们都是盲人。
you're both working blind.

431
00:20:17,911 --> 00:20:19,696
我会和我哥哥在一起。
I'll stick with my brother.

432
00:20:19,739 --> 00:20:22,133
我要回去了。我们会快点工作，天黑了。
I'm heading back in. We'll work quick, going dark.

433
00:20:32,622 --> 00:20:34,034
我不喜欢他们在里面
I don't like 'em being in there

434
00:20:34,058 --> 00:20:35,886
没有眼睛和耳朵。
with no eyes and ears.

435
00:21:00,606 --> 00:21:02,565
尤其是当他们灰色夹克
Especially when them gray jackets

436
00:21:02,608 --> 00:21:04,107
被什么事激怒了。
are getting stirred up about something.

437
00:21:05,785 --> 00:21:08,614
可能与这有关。去街上看看。
Might have to do with that. Check out the street.

438
00:21:15,534 --> 00:21:16,753
嘿。
Hey.

439
00:21:30,854 --> 00:21:32,072
这是什么？
What's this?

440
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:34,553
是贵宾。
It's the VIP.

441
00:21:35,641 --> 00:21:37,556
更多的后卫。
More guards in the mix.

442
00:21:39,166 --> 00:21:40,907
布拉沃1号，这是3号。
Bravo 1, this is 3.

443
00:21:40,951 --> 00:21:42,711
安全部门正在扫荡并前进
Security's doing a sweep and making their way

444
00:21:42,735 --> 00:21:45,303
取决于我们的人的位置。
up to our guys' pos.

445
00:21:45,347 --> 00:21:47,218
-你收到了吗？-收到.
- Do you copy? - Copy.

446
00:21:48,393 --> 00:21:51,135
-有什么动作？-你留在这里.
- What's the move? - You stay here.

447
00:21:53,311 --> 00:21:54,878
我要上去了。
I'm going up.

448
00:22:23,515 --> 00:22:25,256
工作旅行，是的。
Work trip, yeah.

449
00:22:26,475 --> 00:22:28,520
干热，我的屁股，对吧？
Dry heat, my ass, right?

450
00:22:45,058 --> 00:22:46,538
来吧，贾斯。
Come on, Jas.

451
00:22:46,582 --> 00:22:48,497
还是没通过。
Still not getting through.

452
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:50,281
我们没有选择了。
We're running out of options.

453
00:22:55,199 --> 00:22:56,766
嘿。我们需要搬家。
Hey. We need to move.

454
00:22:56,809 --> 00:22:58,376
现在。走吧。
Now. Let's go.

455
00:23:28,145 --> 00:23:29,494
得到我们想要的东西吗？
Get what we're after?

456
00:23:29,538 --> 00:23:31,888
-差一点。-很幸运能出去。
- Not even close. - Just lucky to get out.

457
00:23:45,815 --> 00:23:47,357
我想你们两个公司袭击者
I take it you two corporate raiders

458
00:23:47,381 --> 00:23:48,731
没有完成交易。
didn't close the deal.

459
00:23:48,774 --> 00:23:50,254
科伊周围有防火墙，
Khoi's got a firewall around him,

460
00:23:50,297 --> 00:23:51,884
我们甚至不能进入他该死的网络。
we couldn't even tap into his damn network.

461
00:23:51,908 --> 00:23:54,258
哦，这绝对使我们无处可去。
Oh, and that puts us absolutely nowhere.

462
00:23:54,301 --> 00:23:55,888
告诉你，伙计，我们为什么不去佩特拉
Tell you what, man, why don't we go to Petra

463
00:23:55,912 --> 00:23:58,088
做点什么？
and make something of this godforsaken trip?

464
00:23:58,131 --> 00:24:00,699
-哟，我们可能不会无处可去。-那是什么意思？
- Yo, we might not be nowhere. - What's that mean?

465
00:24:00,743 --> 00:24:02,721
所以，我无意中听到两个警卫跑嘴
So, I overheard the two guards running their mouths

466
00:24:02,745 --> 00:24:04,529
在电梯里穿过杰森的开放式通讯。
in the elevator through Jason's open comms.

467
00:24:04,573 --> 00:24:06,400
Khoi的家伙提到陪同他的老板
Khoi's guy mentioned accompanying his boss

468
00:24:06,444 --> 00:24:08,402
今晚在安曼城堡举行的活动
to an event tonight at the Amman Citadel

469
00:24:08,446 --> 00:24:10,187
在他们去中国之前。
before they head to China.

470
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:11,904
看起来这将是一个地狱般的派对。
And it looks like it'll be one hell of a party.

471
00:24:11,928 --> 00:24:14,539
酒，女人...也许他的防御能力下降了。
Booze, women... Maybe his defenses come down.

472
00:24:14,583 --> 00:24:16,062
如果我们靠近他，
If we get close to him there,

473
00:24:16,106 --> 00:24:17,779
也许我们可以尝试克隆他的手机
maybe we can take a swing at cloning his phone

474
00:24:17,803 --> 00:24:19,477
-在他上飞机之前。-哦，伙计，电话是
- before he gets on his flight. - Aw, man, the phone's

475
00:24:19,501 --> 00:24:21,421
可能和电脑一样安全。
probably just as hack-proofed as the computer is.

476
00:24:27,117 --> 00:24:29,162
等等，你知道，派对之间的路线
Hold on, you know, the route between the party

477
00:24:29,206 --> 00:24:31,208
机场，这里有很多死角。
and the airport, there's a lot of dead spaces here.

478
00:24:31,251 --> 00:24:32,577
-那是什么意思？-这是什么意思？
- What's that mean? - What does it mean?

479
00:24:32,601 --> 00:24:33,993
你知道吗，我们还有最后一次机会
You know what, we got one last shot

480
00:24:34,037 --> 00:24:35,995
在这家伙消失之前得到他。
of getting this guy Khoi before he vanishes.

481
00:24:36,039 --> 00:24:37,867
手术刀坏了...
Now, the scalpel, it's not working...

482
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:39,584
对这家伙太微妙了。必须放下锤子，
Too delicate with this guy. Gotta drop the hammer,

483
00:24:39,608 --> 00:24:41,000
亲自去找那个人。
get the guy himself.

484
00:24:41,044 --> 00:24:42,872
杰森，我们不需要科伊，我们需要他的数据。
Jason, we don't need Khoi, we need his data.

485
00:24:42,915 --> 00:24:45,048
那我们走了多远？我们哪儿也找不到，好吗？
Well, how far did that get us? Got us nowhere, okay?

486
00:24:45,091 --> 00:24:46,963
电话没电了。别管电话了。
Phone's out. Forget the phone.

487
00:24:47,006 --> 00:24:50,183
好吧，科伊在半夜离开狂欢，
Okay, Khoi leaves the shindig, middle of the night,

488
00:24:50,227 --> 00:24:52,534
其中一个死区，车辆拦截。
one of those dead zones, vehicle interdiction.

489
00:24:52,577 --> 00:24:54,318
我们粉碎并抓住这个混蛋
We smash and grab this motherfucker

490
00:24:54,361 --> 00:24:56,078
挤压他对将军的了解。
and squeeze him for all he knows about the general.

491
00:24:56,102 --> 00:24:57,819
-是的，是的，是的.-你让它听起来
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. - You're making it sound

492
00:24:57,843 --> 00:24:59,410
好像我们不是在谈论十几个变量
like we're not talking a dozen variables

493
00:24:59,453 --> 00:25:00,692
那可能意味着灾难，贾斯。
that could spell disaster, Jas.

494
00:25:00,716 --> 00:25:02,326
科伊的警卫，他们不是开玩笑。
Khoi's guards, they're no joke.

495
00:25:02,369 --> 00:25:04,154
车是装甲的，我们得到了，什么，
The vehicle's up-armored, and we got, what,

496
00:25:04,197 --> 00:25:06,286
派对开始前八小时？
eight hours before this party kicks off?

497
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:08,288
-来吧.-那我们开始工作吧.
- Come on. - So, let's get to work.

498
00:25:08,332 --> 00:25:11,248
某些因素使op脱离了Bravo的控制，
Certain factors took the op out of Bravo's control,

499
00:25:11,291 --> 00:25:12,815
但是他们的组长通知了我
but their team leader has informed me

500
00:25:12,858 --> 00:25:14,686
他们正在探索其他途径。
they're exploring alternate avenues.

501
00:25:14,730 --> 00:25:16,296
各位，干得好。
Excellent work, everyone.

502
00:25:17,646 --> 00:25:19,256
我能私下和你谈谈吗？
Can I speak to you privately?

503
00:25:25,001 --> 00:25:27,394
我的团队抓了他们的屁股
My team busted their asses

504
00:25:27,438 --> 00:25:28,744
为了让布拉沃到达10码线，
to get Bravo to the 10-yard line,

505
00:25:28,787 --> 00:25:30,006
然后布拉沃摸索了一下。
and then Bravo fumbled it.

506
00:25:30,049 --> 00:25:31,573
看起来不是很久以前的
Didn't seem like that long ago

507
00:25:31,616 --> 00:25:33,444
无论输赢，布拉沃都是你的球队。
that Bravo was your team, win or lose.

508
00:25:33,487 --> 00:25:35,185
我推上山的巨石
The boulder that I pushed up a hill

509
00:25:35,228 --> 00:25:37,404
把他们送回叙利亚，拿到黄铜
to send them back to Syria, to get the brass

510
00:25:37,448 --> 00:25:40,146
在Rajavi上归零，它不能回滚。
zeroed in on Rajavi, it cannot come rolling back down.

511
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:41,844
骑得太多了。
There's too much riding on it.

512
00:25:46,065 --> 00:25:47,719
他们还在追求什么其他途径？
What other avenues are they pursuing?

513
00:25:50,766 --> 00:25:54,421
杰森让我与该地区的相互联系。
Jason had me reach out to a mutual contact in the area.

514
00:25:54,465 --> 00:25:57,207
约旦裔美国人，前OGA可以拉一些弦
Jordanian American, former OGA who can pull some strings

515
00:25:57,250 --> 00:25:59,775
为了便于第二次运行Khoi。
to facilitate a second run on Khoi.

516
00:25:59,818 --> 00:26:02,429
那么，他们需要其他数据提取的帮助吗？
Well, what help do they need with another data extraction?

517
00:26:02,473 --> 00:26:05,563
他们已经开始逮捕科伊本人。
They've pivoted to apprehending Khoi himself.

518
00:26:05,607 --> 00:26:10,960
除此之外，我非常相信他们不会问。
Details beyond that, I trust them enough not to ask.

519
00:26:11,003 --> 00:26:12,265
那我会的。
Then I will.

520
00:26:14,572 --> 00:26:17,488
当拉贾维将军的财人消失时会发生什么？
What happens when General Rajavi's money man vanishes?

521
00:26:17,531 --> 00:26:19,229
他会知道我们在追捕他
He will know we are hunting him

522
00:26:19,272 --> 00:26:21,231
他会深入地下。
and he will go even deeper underground.

523
00:26:22,885 --> 00:26:27,977
现在，我只专注于为Bravo的成功而努力。
Right now, all I am focused on is pulling for Bravo's success.

524
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:29,326
明白吗？
Understood?

525
00:26:31,241 --> 00:26:32,329
是的，先生。
Yes, sir.

526
00:27:08,713 --> 00:27:11,455
保持宽阔的泊位。给兔子一些空间。
Keep a wide berth. Give the rabbit some room.

527
00:27:58,894 --> 00:28:00,765
1，这是3。
1, this is 3.

528
00:28:00,809 --> 00:28:02,419
移至第二阶段线。
Moving to phase line two.

529
00:28:02,462 --> 00:28:04,856
-扣上拳头。-收到，3.
- Spiking the punch. - Copy, 3.

530
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:06,486
桑尼正在种植杀人开关的路上
Sonny's on the way to plant the kill switch

531
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:08,338
在科伊的车上。
on Khoi's vehicle.

532
00:28:08,381 --> 00:28:11,254
你的约旦朋友分娩了，带他去派对。
Your Jordanian buddy delivered, getting him into that party.

533
00:28:11,297 --> 00:28:14,953
当然可以。他骗一些票要容易得多
Sure did. A hell of a lot easier for him to scam some tickets

534
00:28:14,997 --> 00:28:17,695
比得到这只该死的鸟更喜欢派对。
into the party than getting this fucking bird.

535
00:28:19,088 --> 00:28:22,613
所以，HVT上路了，他们会杀死引擎，
So, HVT hits the road, they'll kill the engine,

536
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:25,311
我们将突袭并进行空对地拦截。
we'll swoop in and do an air-to-ground interdiction.

537
00:28:26,835 --> 00:28:28,880
听起来很简单。
It sounds simple.

538
00:28:28,924 --> 00:28:30,969
是的。但愿如此。
Yeah. Let's hope.

539
00:28:44,722 --> 00:28:46,289
是的。哦。
Yeah. Oh.

540
00:28:46,332 --> 00:28:48,726
是啊，嘿。是的，但是...
Yeah, hey. Yeah, but...

541
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:51,033
是的。我绊倒了。
Yeah. I tripped.

542
00:28:51,076 --> 00:28:52,817
这里的这些路是...
These roads here are...

543
00:28:53,862 --> 00:28:56,299
安全!
Security!

544
00:28:57,866 --> 00:29:00,216
喔，喔，喔。
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

545
00:29:12,794 --> 00:29:14,447
告诉他们你是汽车高管，
Told 'em you're an auto exec,

546
00:29:14,491 --> 00:29:16,034
忍不住仔细看看一个漂亮的底盘。
can't resist getting a close look at a nice chassis.

547
00:29:16,058 --> 00:29:19,278
赫夫纳，你知道我在说什么吗？
Well, Hefner here, you know what I'm talking about?

548
00:29:19,322 --> 00:29:21,193
我说得对吗？
Am I right, yeah, huh?

549
00:29:21,237 --> 00:29:23,195
是的，听着，我们应该回到派对上。
Yeah, look, we should get back to the party.

550
00:29:23,239 --> 00:29:25,284
好吧。
Okay.

551
00:29:25,328 --> 00:29:26,895
好吧好吧。
Okay, okay.

552
00:29:26,938 --> 00:29:28,200
嘿。
Hey.

553
00:29:33,466 --> 00:29:34,685
伙计们。
Hey, guys.

554
00:29:36,948 --> 00:29:38,863
你搞定了吗？
You get it done?

555
00:29:38,907 --> 00:29:39,995
没错。
Yep.

556
00:29:41,344 --> 00:29:43,563
这是2，磁铁在冰箱上。
This is 2, the magnet is on the fridge.

557
00:29:43,607 --> 00:29:45,696
2和3都烧了，落回到我们的卡车上。
2 and 3 both burned, falling back to our truck.

558
00:29:52,007 --> 00:29:53,878
你听到了吗？
Do you hear that?

559
00:29:53,922 --> 00:29:56,228
不，布莱恩醒了吗？
No. Brian wake up?

560
00:29:57,447 --> 00:30:00,450
不，很安静。
No. It's quiet.

561
00:30:02,408 --> 00:30:05,803
哇哦。
Oh, wow.

562
00:30:05,847 --> 00:30:08,414
嗨，思想和内心独白，
Hi, thoughts and inner monologue,

563
00:30:08,458 --> 00:30:10,242
已经很久了。
it's been so long.

564
00:30:10,286 --> 00:30:11,940
别让我打断。
Don't let me interrupt.

565
00:30:13,158 --> 00:30:14,527
你脑子里的声音有什么新变化？
What's new with the voice in your head?

566
00:30:14,551 --> 00:30:16,205
她很好。
She's good.

567
00:30:17,554 --> 00:30:19,556
她很好，是的。你的呢？
She's good, yeah. What about yours?

568
00:30:26,258 --> 00:30:27,607
这是什么？
What is it?

569
00:30:28,957 --> 00:30:30,045
我，呃...
I'm, uh...

570
00:30:32,047 --> 00:30:34,310
我想我不想回到绿队。
I don't think I wanna go back to Green Team.

571
00:30:38,357 --> 00:30:40,533
什么意思？做...
What do you mean? Do...

572
00:30:41,883 --> 00:30:43,493
你想回去手术吗？
Do you wanna go back to operating?

573
00:30:48,237 --> 00:30:51,196
如果我们没有停泊在这里，你想去哪里？
If we weren't anchored here, where would you wanna go?

574
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:56,158
比如，如果你能在任何地方追求你想要的任何东西，
Like, if you could pursue whatever you wanted, wherever,

575
00:30:56,201 --> 00:30:57,594
在任何地方抚养布莱恩？
raise Brian anywhere?

576
00:30:57,637 --> 00:30:59,335
为什么？
Why?

577
00:30:59,378 --> 00:31:01,424
因为我们生活的大部分时间都是关于我的。
Because so much of our life has just been about me.

578
00:31:01,467 --> 00:31:04,209
你知道，我的工作，我的时间表，我的挣扎。
You know, my job, my schedule, my struggles.

579
00:31:04,253 --> 00:31:06,124
嗯，不，不，不。它们是我们的。
Mm-mm, no, no, no. They're ours.

580
00:31:06,168 --> 00:31:07,909
-来吧，作家。-我是认真的.
- Come on, writer. - I'm serious.

581
00:31:07,952 --> 00:31:09,606
告诉我下一章。
Tell me the next chapter.

582
00:31:11,564 --> 00:31:13,001
哦，上帝...
Oh, God...

583
00:31:14,828 --> 00:31:16,352
好吧。
Okay.

584
00:31:18,876 --> 00:31:20,965
门多西诺海岸。
Mm, Mendocino Coast.

585
00:31:21,009 --> 00:31:23,272
一个小隔板小屋。
A little clapboard cottage.

586
00:31:23,315 --> 00:31:30,018
嗯，我教书，写我的小说，
Um, I teach and I work on my novel,

587
00:31:30,061 --> 00:31:31,671
这当然很棒，
which is, of course, brilliant,

588
00:31:31,715 --> 00:31:34,065
但仍然非常畅销。
but still very much best-seller accessible.

589
00:31:36,067 --> 00:31:40,724
我们三个去散步
And the three of us, we go on a walk

590
00:31:40,767 --> 00:31:44,423
海滩上的每一次日落。
every sunset on the beach.

591
00:31:45,859 --> 00:31:48,427
是的。如果你问的话。
Yeah. If you're asking.

592
00:31:49,472 --> 00:31:50,647
我是。
I am.

593
00:31:52,301 --> 00:31:53,737
听着，我一直在和阿什谈过
Look, I've been talking to Ash

594
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:55,695
关于恢复我们的TBI十字军东征，
about picking our TBI crusade back up,

595
00:31:55,739 --> 00:31:58,002
但我可以在任何地方做到这一点。
but I can do that from anywhere.

596
00:31:58,046 --> 00:32:00,004
你真的是认真的吗？
You're actually serious?

597
00:32:02,398 --> 00:32:05,444
自从我们相遇以来，我从未想过让你惊讶。
Ever since we met, I never wanted to stop surprising you.

598
00:32:11,189 --> 00:32:12,582
哦，对不起。
Oh, sorry.

599
00:32:12,625 --> 00:32:15,324
-我是本.-去吧.
- It's Ben. - Go ahead.

600
00:32:17,891 --> 00:32:19,173
嘿，本，怎么了？
Hey, Ben, what's up?

601
00:32:19,197 --> 00:32:20,546
克莱，需要你的帮助。
Clay, need your help here.

602
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:22,046
哟，怎么了，伙计？你在哪里？
Yo, what's going on, man? Where are you?

603
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:23,593
在汉普顿的购物中心后面，
Behind the strip mall in Hampton,

604
00:32:23,636 --> 00:32:25,116
6号高速公路和寺庙。你能来吗？
Highway 6 and Temple. Can you come?

605
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,726
嘿，嘿，好吧，慢点，慢点。
Hey, hey, well, slow down, slow down.

606
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:27,945
怎么回事？
What's going on?

607
00:32:30,643 --> 00:32:31,905
本。
Ben?

608
00:32:36,388 --> 00:32:38,434
-这是什么？-我不知道.
- What is it? - I don't know.

609
00:32:38,477 --> 00:32:40,131
他听起来很疯狂。
He sounded frantic.

610
00:32:40,175 --> 00:32:42,255
好吧，你上次见到他时说他在旋转。
Well, you said he was spinning last time you saw him.

611
00:32:44,092 --> 00:32:45,223
是的。
Yeah.

612
00:32:47,834 --> 00:32:49,401
也许我应该去看看他。
Maybe I should go check on him.

613
00:32:52,665 --> 00:32:53,927
当然。
Sure.

614
00:32:56,539 --> 00:32:58,193
好吧，我很快就回来，好吗？
All right, I'll be back soon, okay?

615
00:32:59,368 --> 00:33:00,760
-爱你.-爱你.
- Love you. - Love you.

616
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:17,777
好吧，我明天会收到你的来信。谢谢。
Okay, I'll be hearing from you tomorrow. Thank you.

617
00:33:19,388 --> 00:33:20,954
太棒了，待命。
Bravo, stand by.

618
00:33:20,998 --> 00:33:22,956
HVT可能正在退出。
HVT may be making his exit.

619
00:34:01,865 --> 00:34:03,432
太棒了，这是真子1号。
Bravo, this is Mako 1.

620
00:34:03,475 --> 00:34:05,434
HVT正在登上一架私人直升机。
HVT is boarding a private helicopter.

621
00:34:05,477 --> 00:34:08,263
我再说一遍，他是乘飞机离开的，而不是地面。
I say again, he is leaving by air, not ground.

622
00:34:08,306 --> 00:34:10,743
收到，HVT由直升机离开。
Copy, HVT leaving by helo.

623
00:34:10,787 --> 00:34:12,180
搞什么鬼？
What the fuck?

624
00:34:15,922 --> 00:34:17,663
真子1号，HVT的鸟，
Mako 1, HVT's bird,

625
00:34:17,707 --> 00:34:19,317
它有HeloSAT还是天线？
does it have a HeloSAT or an antenna?

626
00:34:20,144 --> 00:34:22,494
这是直升机。为什么，你在想什么？
It's a HeloSAT. Why, what are you thinking?

627
00:34:22,538 --> 00:34:26,107
我想我们在拦截之前先杀死通讯。
I'm thinking we kill the comms before we do an interdiction.

628
00:34:27,630 --> 00:34:29,197
1、再说一遍，拦截？
1, say again, interdict?

629
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:30,565
是的，我们要做一个从直升机到直升机的拦截。
Yeah, we're gonna do a helo-to-helo interdiction.

630
00:34:30,589 --> 00:34:31,895
他刚才说了什么？
The hell did he just say?

631
00:34:31,938 --> 00:34:33,331
1，我不认为这是一种选择。
1, I don't see that as an option.

632
00:34:33,375 --> 00:34:35,159
让你的跟车跟踪我们。
Have your follow vehicle trail us.

633
00:34:44,125 --> 00:34:45,865
1，我们以前从未尝试过直升机。
1, we've never tried a helo-to-helo before.

634
00:34:47,606 --> 00:34:50,827
战术卡玛经的页面我们不需要探索。
Page of the tactical Kama Sutra we do not need to explore.

635
00:34:50,870 --> 00:34:52,655
布拉沃1号，不值得你
Bravo 1, head-shed doesn't deserve you

636
00:34:52,698 --> 00:34:54,396
像这样让自己处于困境。
to put yourself on the line like this.

637
00:34:55,875 --> 00:34:57,050
你的电话。
Your call.

638
00:34:58,226 --> 00:34:59,923
布拉沃2号，你读了什么？
Bravo 2, what's your read?

639
00:34:59,966 --> 00:35:01,316
这是万福玛利亚。
It's a Hail Mary.

640
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:03,535
我说，布拉沃2号，你读了什么？
I said, Bravo 2, what's your read?

641
00:35:05,537 --> 00:35:07,235
布拉沃2。
Bravo 2.

642
00:35:07,278 --> 00:35:09,237
空中拦截是我们唯一剩下的子弹。
Air interdiction's our only bullet left.

643
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,977
说这个词。
Say the word.

644
00:35:13,241 --> 00:35:14,807
-我们在旋转。-好吧.
- We're spinning up. - All right.

645
00:36:53,950 --> 00:36:56,213
试图了解他们的直升机。
Trying to get an angle on their HeloSAT.

646
00:37:01,131 --> 00:37:02,959
头奖!他们的通讯被切断了。
Jackpot! Their comms are cut.

647
00:37:06,136 --> 00:37:08,138
给他们示意。
Signal them down.

648
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:19,105
他们没有回应。
They're not responding.

649
00:37:19,149 --> 00:37:20,498
这会引起他们的注意。
This'll get their attention.

650
00:37:32,336 --> 00:37:33,859
他们正在放下。
They're putting down.

651
00:39:13,437 --> 00:39:14,873
你在做什么？
What are you doing?

652
00:39:17,485 --> 00:39:18,660
你真的来了。
You actually came.

653
00:39:20,488 --> 00:39:22,794
空军征兵中心。
Air Force Recruitment Center.

654
00:39:22,838 --> 00:39:24,796
这是你入伍的地方？
This where you enlisted?

655
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,842
犯罪现场。
The scene of the crime.

656
00:39:26,885 --> 00:39:28,452
你的忍者技能帮助我进去，
Your ninja skills help me get in there,

657
00:39:28,496 --> 00:39:30,212
我们可以像他们对我一样对他们的办公室。
we can do to their office what they did to me.

658
00:39:30,236 --> 00:39:31,803
-你不会想这么做的.-你告诉我
- You don't wanna do that. - You told me

659
00:39:31,847 --> 00:39:33,457
我应该切断与服务的联系。
I should cut ties with the service.

660
00:39:33,501 --> 00:39:35,546
不能就这么走开，
Can't just walk away,

661
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:37,635
让其他孩子在里面被吮吸。
let some other kid get suckered in there.

662
00:39:39,768 --> 00:39:42,423
烧毁这个地方可能真的会有所作为，
Torching this place might actually do some fucking good,

663
00:39:42,466 --> 00:39:44,096
救赎我手上的血。
and redeem me for all the blood on my hands.

664
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,469
嘿，停下，停下，停下!
Hey, stop, stop, stop!

665
00:39:46,775 --> 00:39:48,298
你想被抓住吗？
You trying to get caught?

666
00:39:49,865 --> 00:39:52,650
我们去别的地方，我们可以好好谈谈。
Let's go someplace else, we can talk this through.

667
00:39:52,694 --> 00:39:54,609
那边有安全巡逻队，伙计。
There's security patrol right down the way, man.

668
00:39:54,652 --> 00:39:57,133
如果你不是来帮忙的，滚开。
If you're not here to help, fuck off.

669
00:39:58,003 --> 00:40:00,266
这只会让你的生活变得更糟。
This is only gonna mess your life up even worse.

670
00:40:01,442 --> 00:40:03,008
你现在正在经历的斗争，

671
00:40:03,052 --> 00:40:05,010
这不能解决问题。

672
00:40:07,883 --> 00:40:09,754
嗯，你可能是对的。

它不会治好我。
It won't fix me.

674
00:40:12,888 --> 00:40:16,065
在这一点上什么都不会。

675
00:40:17,719 --> 00:40:19,982
-那不是真的.-是的.

676
00:40:20,983 --> 00:40:24,247
我的生活已经在这里结束了。
My life already ended here at one point.

677
00:40:24,290 --> 00:40:26,771
不需要留下来...

678
00:40:26,815 --> 00:40:29,208
看到它再次发生。
to see it happen again.

679
00:40:36,999 --> 00:40:39,001
-你他妈的成功了。-还没结束.

680
00:40:39,044 --> 00:40:40,655
桑尼，检查一下。

嘿，把他转过来。

682
00:40:44,267 --> 00:40:45,636
-我们谈谈.-你是个商人，

683
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:47,183
所以你知道这笔交易是怎么进行的。
so you know how this deal goes.

684
00:40:47,226 --> 00:40:49,011
给我们我们需要的情报，这保持平稳。
Give us the intel we need, this stays smooth.

685
00:40:49,054 --> 00:40:51,335
否则你会感到我们从你身边得到它的痛苦。
Or you're gonna feel the pain of us getting it out of you.

686
00:40:53,363 --> 00:40:55,365
我能为美国政府做些什么

687
00:40:55,408 --> 00:40:57,498
回到我的夜晚，先生们？

688
00:40:57,541 --> 00:41:00,283
拉贾维将军，你处理他的财务。

and that nasty rumor is the one you want to discuss?

692
00:41:06,376 --> 00:41:08,683
我不向我的律师套路是失当的。
I would be remiss not to loop in my attorneys.

693
00:41:08,726 --> 00:41:10,574
你认为空中追逐和你的两个死去的警卫
Do you think a mid-air chase and your two dead guards

694
00:41:10,598 --> 00:41:12,401
是让你的律师参与进来的热身吗？
was a warm-up to getting your lawyers involved?

695
00:41:12,425 --> 00:41:14,123
拉贾维，何时何地？
Rajavi, when and where?

696
00:41:14,166 --> 00:41:15,733
否则他们会找到你的尸体

在燃烧的直升机里。

698
00:41:18,736 --> 00:41:21,565
恐怕那些半空戏剧都是徒劳的。
I'm afraid those mid-air theatrics were all for naught.

699
00:41:21,609 --> 00:41:23,393
太好了，把他绑起来。烧死那个混蛋。
Great, strap him in. Burn the fucker.

我的手机在我的左口袋里。

你需要的所有验证都在那里。

711
00:41:57,732 --> 00:42:00,648
-直到我们能确认.-那我怎么了？
- until we can confirm that. - Then what happens to me?

712
00:42:00,691 --> 00:42:02,277
总比将军会发生什么要好。
Better than what's gonna happen to the general.

713
00:42:02,301 --> 00:42:04,565
把他塞进他妈的卡车里。
Stuff him in the fucking truck.

714
00:42:14,444 --> 00:42:16,707
-把他妈的枪放下.-走!

715
00:42:16,751 --> 00:42:18,317
听着，我不会离开你的，好吗？
Look, I'm not leaving you, okay?

716
00:42:18,361 --> 00:42:20,208
-这不是答案.-你自己也这么说.
- This isn't the answer. - You said so yourself.

717
00:42:20,232 --> 00:42:22,887
军方和政客不会让我们重新团结起来。
Military and politicians ain't gonna put us back together.

718
00:42:24,106 --> 00:42:26,064
也许这会叫醒他们。
Maybe this'll wake 'em up.

719
00:42:27,065 --> 00:42:29,111
听着，我的...我的朋友四年前开枪自杀了
Look, my... my buddy shot himself four years ago

720
00:42:29,154 --> 00:42:31,330
在v.A.停车场。
in the V.A. parking lot.

721
00:42:31,374 --> 00:42:33,550
你认为这有什么不同吗？

722
00:42:33,594 --> 00:42:35,683
我不会让你跟随他的脚步。
I'm not letting you follow in his footsteps.

723
00:42:35,726 --> 00:42:37,859
听着，美国战争机器唯一的东西

724
00:42:37,902 --> 00:42:39,425
已经证明它有能力

725
00:42:39,469 --> 00:42:41,384
正在咀嚼并吐出它的战士们。

但我们必须继续战斗。

但是像你这样的人值得为之奋斗。

我被认为是最大的坏蛋之一

731
00:42:59,315 --> 00:43:01,099
在这个星球上，一个可怜的工作对象

733
00:43:02,710 --> 00:43:04,494
这让我回到了你几周前的位置。
And it put me right where you are weeks ago.

734
00:43:05,887 --> 00:43:07,386
我有一支步枪，在树林里挑出一个地方，

我没看到回来的路。

但愿我有这样的队友。

这场该死的战争已经是第三个十年了。

Man, guys like us, we're not alone.

你真的认为这就是为什么？

743
00:43:30,563 --> 00:43:32,870
我不知道，伙计，一定有什么意义
I don't know, man, there's gotta be some point
