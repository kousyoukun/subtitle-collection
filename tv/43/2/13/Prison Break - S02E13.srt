1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,150
Previously on Prison Break

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:03,870
We're staying.

3
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:05,910
Give 'em hell.

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:14,760
Phil, don't do this.

5
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:16,700
I've dedicated my life to this country.

6
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:20,490
Every photo, every
file-Get rid of it all.

7
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:21,980
Phil, don't do this.

8
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:24,110
You left a message for mr.Geary.

9
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,720
I'm going to gut you, bow to stern.

10
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:27,460
I did not kill roy geary.

11
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:28,780
Bagwell set me up.

12
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:31,380
You are under arrest for the first
degree murder of roy william geary.

13
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:34,040
My therapist said that
I need to confront you to

14
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:36,740
Let you know how betrayed I feel.

15
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:39,910
This is the tribune police.

16
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:42,720
Look, as long as you do your
job with me, not a chance.

17
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:46,400
And then you can go back to colorado
and visit your son and family.

18
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,200
Don't you ever mention his name again.

19
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,930
What about your friend back there?

20
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:53,360
If we're going to go down...

21
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,250
Might as well go down swinging.

22
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,540
Sara. Michael?

23
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,240
Almost made it.

24
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,320
Hello.

25
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:17,500
Hello.Michael?

26
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:20,580
Get up.

27
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,550
Turn around.

28
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:27,920
Turn around!

29
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,000
If you're going to murder us, Alex

30
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,620
You're going to have to look
us in the eyes while you do it.

31
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:32,640
Shut up.

32
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:34,130
You want me, you got me.

33
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:35,350
Let my brother go!

34
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:36,620
I don't want either of you.

35
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,810
I just want my life back!

36
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:40,600
You're going to kill two
innocent men to get it, huh?

37
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,200
Absolutely.

38
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:44,560
This is the united states border patrol.

39
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:47,180
Drop the weapon and
remain where you are.

40
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,700
Drop your weapon.

41
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:53,650
United states border
patrol.Drop your weapon.

42
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:59,300
I'm FBI.These men are in my custody.

43
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:00,460
I don't care who you are.

44
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:05,320
Until we verify, you will drop
your weapon or we will drop you.

45
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:06,990
Your choice.

46
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:27,570
Hands' on your head.Don't move.

47
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,820
You got anything to drink?

48
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:37,790
Check the back.

49
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:41,460
Unknown rider, unknown
rider, this is dea on guard.

50
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:44,100
Bring up frequency 1145.

51
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:46,540
Uh-Oh.

52
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,470
Uh-Oh?

53
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,570
What do you mean, "uh-Oh"?

54
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:51,530
Border patrol's on our ass, man.

55
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,920
How long till we get to Mexico?

56
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:55,760
We're already in Mexico, papa.

57
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,080
I thought they couldn't follow
us once we crossed the bord.

58
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:00,030
Hey, not since 9/11, hombre.

59
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,570
I repeat: This is dea on guard.

60
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:04,000
What are we going to do?

61
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,200
Pull the chord.

62
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:07,360
And pray.

63
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:09,050
Oh, hell, no.

64
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:12,250
Look, we try and land the
plane, we're pinched for sure.

65
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:14,010
And if we jump?

66
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:16,050
We're in the middle of the desert.

67
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:19,660
Patrol have a hard time
trying to find us once we land.

68
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:21,270
If we land.

69
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,770
Oh, you're going to land.

70
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,920
It's just a matter of how hard.

71
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,500
Good luck, amigo.

72
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:47,880
We're receiving reports that
escaped convicts Lincoln Burrows

73
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,350
And Michael Scofield
have been apprehended

74
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:52,730
Just a few miles north
of the us-Mexican border.

75
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:56,140
Federal agent Alex Mahone with
assistance from the united states

76
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:59,900
Border patrol took the men into
custody just a short time ago.

77
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:02,070
Now, not a lot of information
available at this time

78
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:04,100
But we do know the
brothers were apprehended

79
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:06,380
Without incident while
attempting to leave the country

80
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:08,950
Through the deserts of
new Mexico quite a long way

81
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:10,920
From illinois's fox
river state penitentiary

82
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:13,460
Where they escaped from
less than ten days ago.

83
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:16,620
The fox river eight, as the
group of convicts were once known

84
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:20,480
Are now down to four, as
only Benjamin Miles Franklin

85
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,500
Fernando Sucre, Charles Pathoshik
and Theodore Bagwell remain at large.

86
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:30,300
Sir. He just heard. And
he'd like to see you.

87
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:40,080
Convicts are now down to four
as only Benjamin miles Franklin

88
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,580
Fernando Sucre, Charles Pathoshik
and Theodore Bagwell remain at large.

89
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:46,260
Godspeed, gentlemen.

90
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:10,290
'Scuse me, sarge.

91
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:14,070
I,uh,was wondering if you
could, uh, help a brother out.

92
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:15,590
With what?

93
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,230
I only recently returned
from delivering democracy

94
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:24,050
To the desert and, uh, I was
wondering if you could tell me

95
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:27,200
How a guy goes about getting a hold
of one of those prosthetic jobbies.

96
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,460
What, they make you whole
before they shipped you back?

97
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:32,680
Well, let's just say
the doctor made the bed.

98
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:35,270
He just neglected to tuck in the sheets.

99
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:38,380
Best thing for you to do
is go on down there to va.

100
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:40,000
Get in line.

101
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:42,260
That simple?

102
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:43,810
Yeah.

103
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,120
Till they send you the Bill and
you got to figure out how to pay.

104
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,310
Those bastards up there
in washington send us off

105
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:51,670
To fight for them; not a
damn one of 'em fights for us.

106
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:53,840
And that is a crime.

107
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:57,240
But luckily for me, uh...

108
00:05:57,330 --> 00:05:59,750
Money is not the issue.

109
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:01,260
Is that right?

110
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:05,620
Any particular, uh, forms i
might need in order to qualify?

111
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,910
You know what, mr.
Don't ask, don't tell?

112
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:11,830
You figured out how to dye
that hair of yours up like

113
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:14,860
Like a nancy all by yourself,you
sure as hell can figure out

114
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:18,650
How to get a prosthetic for
that stump of yours by yourself.

115
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:27,500
Yeah, I think I got a pretty
good idea where to start.

116
00:06:42,645 --> 00:06:46,030
I'm here with Ed Pavelka, the new
warden of fox river penitentiary

117
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:48,760
Where Lincoln Burrows and
Michael Scofield are scheduled to

118
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:50,700
Be returned to sometime tomorrow.

119
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:53,010
Now, warden, the escape
happened a mere two days

120
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:55,460
Before Burrows was
scheduled to be put to death.

121
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:58,760
He's already been granted one
day; do you anticipate any further?

122
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:01,830
Lincoln Burrows is a convicted murderer.

123
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:06,010
His escape has endangered the lives
of civilians across this country.

124
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,440
He is not a celebrity.
He is not a martyr.

125
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:13,220
I can assure you that whatever
leniency was afforded him

126
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:17,850
And the her prisoners under the old regime
at fox river will no longer be tolerated.

127
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:21,050
The only thing that
mr.Burrows can expect is

128
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,670
What a jury of his peers
demanded: A speedy execution.

129
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:26,020
And Michael Scofield?

130
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:32,370
With his escape, the aiding and abetting
charges the felonies he's racked up along the way

131
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:36,290
On top of his original sentence
I'd say mr.Scofield will be spending

132
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:39,950
The rest of his life
behind bars.Thank you.

133
00:08:07,169 --> 00:08:11,392
Prison Break season 2 episode 13

134
00:08:15,278 --> 00:08:17,100
Who's got Mahone?

135
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:21,970
Congratulations, sir.

136
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:22,780
What do you got?

137
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:25,090
A call from the illinois doc.

138
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:27,340
They're sending a huge contingent
down there to collect Burrows

139
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,640
And Scofield, take them
back to fox river personally.

140
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:32,420
Remind them this is a federal case
and we'll handle the transport.Now...

141
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:35,940
I did. But it's an election year,
collar this big everybody wants a piece.

142
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:39,830
The warden called in a favor to the
bureau chief; he okayed it, so here we are.

143
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:41,930
Should be there in about an hour.

144
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:44,880
I want to be placed in the
prisoner transport vehicle.

145
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:46,130
What for?

146
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:47,620
Just get it done.

147
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:50,350
Sir, these were the big fish.

148
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,860
And you brought 'em in.

149
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:54,150
You should feel good about that.

150
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,530
Yeah...

151
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:59,050
Yeah.

152
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,760
Well, at least we're together.

153
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:04,080
Yes, there is that.

154
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,980
What are you thinking?

155
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:11,130
I'm thinking about the old man.

156
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:15,370
What he tried to do, you know.

157
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:20,620
Tough to go down swinging
when you're locked in a box.

158
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,330
This isn't over yet.

159
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,760
We're entitled to a phone call.

160
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:28,540
We make that one call to sara and she
has the information dad said she has

161
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,200
We can get you exonerated before
this whole thing goes down.

162
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:32,170
No.

163
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,410
Hey.

164
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:37,540
We're entitled to a phone call.

165
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:41,910
You're entitled to precisely squat
until you're officially in custody.

166
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:44,620
And that won't happen until
you're back in fox river.

167
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,560
So sit tight.

168
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:53,000
It's not over yeT.

169
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:54,530
Not yet.

170
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:58,970
A lot of ground to cover
between here and illinois.

171
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:04,320
I mean, what are the chances we
even make it back to fox river alive?

172
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:10,530
Saw you on the news, Alex.

173
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:11,540
Did you?

174
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:12,980
The brothers too.

175
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:15,080
They were a little more, um...

176
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:17,880
Breathing than I had hoped.

177
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:20,370
Yeah, well, border patrol
showed up. Nothing I could do.

178
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:21,820
Really?

179
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,680
Burrows and Scofield, can you
see them from where you are?

180
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,050
Yeah.

181
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:29,360
Then put a bullet in their heads.

182
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,070
They're being watched.

183
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:33,660
I don't care.

184
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:34,820
By armed guards.

185
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:37,020
They make it back to
fox river, it is over.

186
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,480
For all of us.

187
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,410
There's not much more this country
loves than a bad man with a good story.

188
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:45,780
How much longer do you think it'll be before
someone puts a microphone in front of them?

189
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:47,220
Hey, are you listening?

190
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:50,950
Okay, with the security here, what you're
asking me to do is tantamount to suicide.

191
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:52,300
Do you understand what I'm saying?

192
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:54,280
I wasn't asking anything.

193
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:57,040
That would imply you
had a say in the matter.

194
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:02,280
Pull this off and you're
halfway home, Alex.

195
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:05,980
You remember what
home is like.Don't you?

196
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:09,520
900 west end avenuE.White
fence.Red door.

197
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:12,260
Stay away from my family!

198
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,720
You got a little
something on your, uh...

199
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,930
No, I...

200
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:15,390
Here, let me.

201
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,840
Pardon my forwardness, I was...

202
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,280
It's okay.Thank you.

203
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,710
Normally I wouldn't
intervene, it's just...

204
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:28,850
Yesterday when I got home from
work I found what looked like

205
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:32,730
The brazilian rain forest lodged
between my two front teeth.

206
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:37,600
And all I could think about was the number
of people who must've seen and not...

207
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:40,650
Not a damn one of them
had the decency to tell me.

208
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:44,460
Mild diastema.

209
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,170
Excuse me?

210
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:50,260
It's a slight gap between
your eight and nine.

211
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,960
Your two front teeth.

212
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:56,530
And that it sometimes can act
as a magnet for food like...

213
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:01,030
Broccoli and tuna and sometimes rice.

214
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,440
Or relish.

215
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,970
All this and brains, too?

216
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:06,740
What are you, a dentist or...

217
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:08,800
Me? No, hardly, no.

218
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,200
I could never.

219
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:12,190
My ex, my ex-Husband, he was...

220
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:13,850
A bastard?

221
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:16,600
That too.

222
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:27,850
Have you ever been to Italy, uh...

223
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:29,550
Denise.

224
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:32,090
Denise, that's a lovely name.

225
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:40,700
You know, in Italy, they have
wine every day with lunch.

226
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:42,720
And what do we do in this country?

227
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:47,320
We power our food down with caffeine,
carbonation and high fructose corn syrup.

228
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:52,120
No one ever takes the time
to enjoy things anymore.

229
00:13:54,530 --> 00:14:04,440
Denise,would you do me the honor of
"enjoying" the rest of your lunch with me?

230
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:09,350
I think I'd like that.

231
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:13,100
White or red?

232
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,160
And with limited financial
resources he poses no flight risk...

233
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:22,960
Unless he'd rather not stand
trial for capital murder.

234
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:26,300
The defendant has shown
great resourcefulness in

235
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:29,860
Being able to travel across
country with little money.

236
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:32,470
There's no reason he
couldn't do it again.

237
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:37,110
If you don't want to believe
me, believe mr. Bellick.

238
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:41,110
You thieving son of a bitch.

239
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,730
You better get down on your
knees and pray to god that

240
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:48,310
I never find you because if I do, mark
my words: I will gut you bow to stern.

241
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:56,490
He promised to kill mr.Geary
and then he kept that promisE.

242
00:14:56,540 --> 00:15:01,940
A man like the defendant
should not be out in society.

243
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:04,590
I concur.

244
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:06,750
Bail denied.

245
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,260
Who would that be?

246
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,800
Only one person.

247
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Michael, it's me. Listen,this
phone rang last night and

248
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:24,610
I went to answer it, but I couldn't hear
anything and I-I nder if maybe it was you?

249
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,550
Oh, god, I don't know
what I should do right now.

250
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:29,950
I don't know if i should leave a message
or who might be listening to this, but...

251
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:34,020
Um, I, uh...I need to
know that you're okay.

252
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:36,530
I need you to know that I'm not.

253
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:39,140
I didn't leave you in gila. Something
happened to me and I don'T...

254
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:42,000
Um, I don't know what to do right now.

255
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,000
I'm not too sure where to go, but
I know that you're the only person

256
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:47,460
I can trust and I need you to, um...

257
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,250
I need you to be okay and, um...

258
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:56,520
And I need you.

259
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:58,370
Please.

260
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:36,020
Alexander Mahone, bureau.

261
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:40,440
These are my prisoners and I
will be personally escorting them

262
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,880
In their transfer vehicle.

263
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:43,210
You can follow in the chase car...

264
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:45,330
I don't believe you heard me.

265
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:47,420
I'll be accompanying them in their...

266
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,550
The only people allowed
in the van are the driver

267
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:55,480
And two guards who've been trained
and certified in prison transport.

268
00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:00,830
Are you really going to
make me go over your head?

269
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:03,830
I'll even dial the phone for you.

270
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:06,770
Now look,this is standard
procedure, agent Mahone.

271
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:09,520
We need to keep that environment
as controllable as possible.

272
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:12,560
The more bodies, the less control.

273
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:17,730
These men may have knowledge of
the location of the other escapees.

274
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:20,130
This is knowledge that I...

275
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:22,240
I need to do my job.

276
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:26,980
And my job is to ensure the safe and
successful transfer of these two prisoners.

277
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:30,360
Chase vehicles are right outside.

278
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:42,850
We're coming to you live as brothers
Lincoln Burrows and Michael Scofield

279
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:44,420
Are being led from the
border patrol holding cell...

280
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:46,980
There better be a damn good reason
why those brothers are still alive.

281
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:48,770
Bad day, Bill?

282
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:52,650
Sorry, I thought this was
someone who still existed.

283
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:54,630
How's the jerky business, Owen?

284
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:56,560
Actually, it's looking
pretty good right about now.

285
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,900
You call this number
again, you're a dead man.

286
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:01,570
Actually, you don't kill Burrows
and Scofield today so are you.

287
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:05,910
You know it and I know it, and luckily
for you I know how to save your ass.

288
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:12,230
The brothers are already
being transferred.

289
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:14,100
You're too late.

290
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:17,590
Actually, that transport van is
exactly where you want them to be, Bill.

291
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:20,400
Why?

292
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:21,910
Why?

293
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:23,730
You want my help,
Bill,I want my job back.

294
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,780
That means direct
access to the president.

295
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:27,520
I report only to her.

296
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,060
You're reaching, Paul.

297
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:30,030
Good-Bye.

298
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:31,390
Don't shut me out,Bill.

299
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:34,080
You think Burrows and Scofield are
a threat to this administration?

300
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:37,030
I know everything
caroline reynolds has done.

301
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:38,850
Everything.

302
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:41,580
Now,before you panic,all I'm asking

303
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:44,680
Is to be allowed to finish
the job that I started.

304
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:46,900
To prove to the president and to you

305
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,160
That I'm still an asset
to this administration.

306
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:53,600
What's your plan?

307
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:58,130
I have an old associate
in the illinois doc.

308
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,570
They're heading up the transfer.

309
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:01,720
It's going to take more
than one guy on the inside.

310
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:04,520
Not if the guy's in the right place.

311
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:06,880
Bill, you give me the go-Ahead on this

312
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:08,710
When those brothers get in the van

313
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:11,100
It'll be the last thing they ever do.

314
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:38,419
I have never done that before.

315
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:44,489
Then I guess we were making
up for some lost time.

316
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:49,789
I have to ask,sam,are you,uh...

317
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:53,399
Are you married or something? Me? No.

318
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:55,079
What makes you think... Come on.

319
00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:57,039
I may be plain,but I'm not a fool.

320
00:20:57,070 --> 00:21:00,729
Usually the men I end up with are
just looking for something,you know...

321
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,419
On the side.

322
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:08,289
Denise,the only "side"
I'm interested in,

323
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:12,939
Is the inside.And that
place within you...

324
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:16,349
Is not plain.

325
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,589
I have to get back to work.

326
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,919
Do you really?

327
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,299
I have to close tonight.

328
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:25,909
How 'bout I pick you up after?

329
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:27,929
We can have dinner.

330
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,809
Are you sure? Denise...

331
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:33,449
I insist.

332
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:50,369
Good news.

333
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,359
You're off the hook.

334
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:55,839
Paul Kellerman has a team ready to move
on the caravan just outside of albuquerque.

335
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,319
Okay.

336
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:58,579
So where does that leave us?

337
00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:01,949
When it goes down,there's sure
to be a moment or two of chaos.

338
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:06,099
A certain amount of
confusion,lots of bullets flying.

339
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:10,819
I need you there to make sure
Paul Kellerman catches one.

340
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:16,619
It's a little early to be
covering your tracks,isn't it?

341
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:19,709
The escapees--
That was our deal.

342
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:20,889
That's all.

343
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:22,449
Right.

344
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:24,839
Our deal.

345
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:30,899
Refresh my memory. Was our deal supposed to end
with Burrows and Scofield going back to prison or...

346
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:33,909
Bleeding from a hole in their heads?

347
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:37,619
We're giving you a chance
to make this right, Alex.

348
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:39,219
Just let Kellerman take care of it.

349
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:41,099
Let him be our oswald.

350
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:42,889
Then,that makes me your jack ruby.

351
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,899
Jack ruby was working alone.

352
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:49,199
You've got the support of the united
states government behind you,Alex.

353
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:51,919
Good luck in albuquerque.

354
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:04,219
I promise,sir,this
will all be over shortly

355
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:07,079
And it will be back
to business as usual.

356
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:12,999
Do you regret it?

357
00:23:13,050 --> 00:23:14,679
What?

358
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:19,539
Knowing what you know
now,do you regret helping me?

359
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:22,539
You'd have done the same thing for me.

360
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:24,979
You think?

361
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:27,449
I know.

362
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:31,109
You didn't answer the question.

363
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:35,779
I don't regret the act.

364
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:39,669
Just how it turned out.

365
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:44,149
We've got a premeditated
murder on our hands.

366
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:46,619
You wanted to steal money and
then kill the only witness.

367
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:49,189
Are you my attorney or theirs?
I told you I didn't do anything.

368
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:51,889
No,I'm just explaining their
theory of what happened.

369
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:54,389
Your explanation to the cops
that you didn't kill geary

370
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:58,609
Because you were too busy trying to steal
five million in federally insured money.

371
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:01,159
Probably not the best move.

372
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:03,159
But there is good news.

373
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:04,369
What's that?

374
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:06,629
The da is willing to offer a deal.

375
00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:08,339
25 years.

376
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:09,629
No.

377
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:11,749
Brad,they'll drop the capital charge.

378
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:13,019
No death penalty.

379
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:14,579
No.

380
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,269
I'd be almost 65 when I get out.

381
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,099
But you'd get out.

382
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:23,239
If this case goes to trial,there's an
excellent chance you're sentenced to death.

383
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:25,819
Now,I've been doing this a
while,brad,and I can tell you

384
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:28,909
These things never go down good.

385
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:34,039
When the system wants you,they
get you,one way or another.

386
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:44,619
Part of the deal's got to
be I do my time in illinois,

387
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:47,359
So i can be with my mom.

388
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,939
Where are they taking us?

389
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:09,409
Another foster home.

390
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,799
I don't want to go.I liked it there.

391
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,359
I know you did.

392
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:14,499
It's 'cause of you.

393
00:25:14,530 --> 00:25:16,909
The reason they're
making us move,isn't it?

394
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,109
'Cause you were getting
in trouble again.

395
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:22,049
Yeah,and I'm sorry.

396
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:31,019
Seems like I've been dragging
you into trouble my whole life.

397
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:33,849
Pulled me out of some,too.

398
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,649
Alex. Paul Kellerman.

399
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:04,399
Have you spoken with Bill kim?

400
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:08,599
Yeah,he filled me in.You're
staging in albuquerque.

401
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,059
Now,listen.

402
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:14,169
Me jumping in at this point.It in no way reflects
my feelings about the job you've been doing.

403
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:16,319
I just wanted you to know that.

404
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:19,199
Of course.

405
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:21,219
So long as we get the job done.

406
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:23,929
And we all get to go back
to our families,right?

407
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:25,899
The sooner the better.

408
00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:28,529
So what do I need to know?

409
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:45,509
What's going on out there?

410
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:47,229
Let me go check.

411
00:27:50,630 --> 00:27:53,399
What do you see?I'll let you know.

412
00:27:57,790 --> 00:27:59,579
How much time is it going
to take to move the semi?

413
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:02,039
I've got my men working on it now.

414
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:12,619
What's going on up there?

415
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:14,619
Are you in a hurry, convict?

416
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:19,669
Hey,we need some help getting
this rig out of the road.

417
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:27,019
Linc.

418
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:38,599
All right, let's say we get
the cuffs off. Where do we go?

419
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,989
There.

420
00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:43,199
That's too easy.

421
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:47,519
Come on. Come on, Michael, take it.

422
00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:52,249
Come on, come on.

423
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:57,389
Take it.

424
00:28:59,670 --> 00:29:02,819
Take it and run.

425
00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:17,319
Let's think about this.

426
00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:21,519
The keys are accidentally left out,
the door is accidentally left open.

427
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:23,839
It's our only shot.
It's their only shot.

428
00:29:23,870 --> 00:29:26,389
They don't have an excuse to
kill us unless we give it to them.

429
00:29:26,410 --> 00:29:27,629
How are we doing?

430
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,879
Mahone: Nothing so far.

431
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:30,289
None?

432
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:32,119
They're talking, that's all.

433
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:35,669
If they haven't bitten in five minutes,
you haul the semi, you tell them it's fixed.

434
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:36,939
You release traffic.

435
00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:38,049
And do what?

436
00:29:38,090 --> 00:29:41,689
If you want the rabbit to
hop, you move the carrot, Alex.

437
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,629
You showed.

438
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,099
A gentleman always does.

439
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:07,779
Where are we going to eat?

440
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:09,809
Wherever your heart desires.

441
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:14,999
You know, there's just one teensy-Tiny
thing I been meaning to ask.

442
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:18,339
Anything.

443
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:24,289
You know, forwarding addresses
are supposed to be confidential.

444
00:30:24,330 --> 00:30:26,799
I really shouldn't be doing this.

445
00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:31,859
You shouldn't have been doing a lot of
the things we did this afternoon, but, uh,

446
00:30:31,890 --> 00:30:35,739
Neither of us has been smited down yet.

447
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:38,929
There she is.

448
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:44,339
I'd imagine your cousin'll be pretty surprised
to hear about the money her uncle left her.

449
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:46,769
You can be certain of it.

450
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:54,189
Sam, I hope you don't
mind me asking, but,um,

451
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:56,289
Your hand.

452
00:30:56,330 --> 00:30:58,789
What happened to it?

453
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:04,729
I'm sorry.I didn't want to make you
feel uncomfortable or nothing.I just...

454
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:07,009
I want to know you.

455
00:31:07,050 --> 00:31:10,179
I want to know everything
about you, and...

456
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:19,019
If this is a part of who you
are, then I want to know how it--

457
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:21,769
Oh, dear god.

458
00:31:27,730 --> 00:31:32,109
I really wish you hadn't seen that.

459
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:55,909
Okay, here's what I'm thinking.

460
00:31:55,950 --> 00:31:58,849
You and some of the boys get
yourselves transferred over to ad seg.

461
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,479
That way, we can spend our days playing
scrabble and watching sportscenter.

462
00:32:01,530 --> 00:32:02,539
Look, cap'N...

463
00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:06,299
Then,in about a year and a half or so, you're gonna
recommend me for one of those work-Release programs.

464
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:09,579
Then, I can sweat off the rest of
my time heaving hay and getting sun.

465
00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:11,979
That's... It ain't freedom,
but it's damn close.

466
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:13,939
Is that why you
requested to be sent here?

467
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:17,579
I go anywhere else-As a
former co, I'm dead man.

468
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:19,469
But here I got men to watch my back.

469
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:22,699
Get me the finest accommodations...
They're not putting you in ad seg.

470
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:24,719
I don'care where they're putting
me.Just take me to ad seg.

471
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:26,549
It's not like it used to be, cap'N.

472
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,449
The cos don't run the game here anymore.

473
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,969
What do you mean? This new warden.

474
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,519
He's cracking down.

475
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:35,269
And to prove he's serious about
showing preferential treatment,

476
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:38,169
He's making an example out of you.

477
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,519
Lou, what the hell is this?

478
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,839
General pop.

479
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:03,339
Welcome home,

480
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:05,989
Boss.

481
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:16,889
Okay, everybody, we're moving out.

482
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:30,919
Window's closi, Michael.
Once the truck moves, we're...

483
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:33,949
If we run now, we give them permission
to put a bullet in our heads.

484
00:35:33,970 --> 00:35:37,139
We stay, I'm dead within the week,
and you're locked up for life.

485
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:39,299
Or until they find a way to get to you.

486
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:40,409
And, believe me, they will.

487
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:42,979
If we go back to prison,
we'll have a few extra days.

488
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:44,509
We'll have a chance to contact sara.

489
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:45,969
We don't know where sara is.

490
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:48,419
Sara may be dead, Michael.

491
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:52,849
Let me get us out of here
the only way I know how.

492
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:54,829
Fighting?

493
00:36:00,530 --> 00:36:02,679
Get the keys.

494
00:36:07,910 --> 00:36:09,639
Here we go.Here we go.

495
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:11,629
Copyhat.

496
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,719
All right, we're on. Heads up.

497
00:36:14,770 --> 00:36:17,379
Hold traffic.

498
00:36:29,810 --> 00:36:32,829
You know we have no idea
what's behind that door.

499
00:36:33,610 --> 00:36:35,649
Nope.

500
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,119
You ready?

501
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,389
No.You?

502
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:41,789
No.

503
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:44,729
Let's go.

504
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:29,659
Just pray there's
another way out of here.

505
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:51,089
Xxx

506
00:38:25,650 --> 00:38:27,199
Hey, they're in.

507
00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:28,509
And they're heading straight for you.

508
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,569
Armed?

509
00:38:29,570 --> 00:38:31,869
No.Where are you?I'll back you up.

510
00:38:31,890 --> 00:38:35,179
Just keep moving. As long as they're
running from you, they're running toward me.

511
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:37,249
They're boxed in.

512
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:09,229
Hold on one sec.

513
00:39:10,330 --> 00:39:12,649
Can I write a check for the
food?'Cause I don't have...

514
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:15,219
Hello, mrs.Hollander.

515
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:18,089
They say a good woman is hard to find.

516
00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:23,379
Well, if that's true,
you must be very, very...

517
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:25,209
Very good.

518
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:27,429
Don't be frightened.

519
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:30,589
Teddy's home.

520
00:40:17,970 --> 00:40:20,969
They're improvising,
heading toward the surface.

521
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:33,779
Where to?

522
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:34,919
I don't know.

523
00:40:34,970 --> 00:40:36,809
Look, if something happens to us

524
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:40,709
If we get separated or one of us doesn't
make it, promise me you'll find sara.

525
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:42,889
We're gonna make it.Just promise me.

526
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:44,789
I promisE.Come on.

527
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,079
President reynolds ruined your life.

528
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:19,249
She ruined my life.

529
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:21,209
You want to take that bitch down?

530
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:25,159
You just found your inside man,
but it's got to be right now.

531
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:26,879
Let's go.

532
00:42:26,910 --> 00:42:29,169
Now!
