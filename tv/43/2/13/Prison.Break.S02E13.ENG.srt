Previously on Prison Break

00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:08,370
We're staying.

3
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:10,410
Give 'em hell.

4
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,260
phil,don't do this.

5
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:22,204
I've dedicated my life to this country.

6
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:24,990
Every photo,every file-- get rid of it all.

7
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:26,480
Phil,don't do thiS.

8
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:28,610
You left a message for mr.Geary.

9
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:30,220
I'm going to gut you,bow to stern.

10
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:31,960
I did not kill roy geary.

11
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:33,280
Bagwell set me up.

12
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,880
You are under arrest for the first degree murder of roy william geary.

13
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:38,540
My therapist said that I need to confront you to

14
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:41,240
let you know how betrayed I feel.

15
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:44,410
this is the tribune police.

16
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:47,220
Look,as long as you do your job with me,not a chance.

17
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:50,900
And then you can go back to colorado
and visit your son and family.

18
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:54,700
Don't you ever mention his name again.

19
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:56,430
What about your friend back there?

20
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,860
If we're going to go down...

21
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:00,750
might as well go down swinging.

22
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:09,040
--sara.
--Michael?

23
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:18,740
almost made it.

24
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:19,820
Hello.

25
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,000
Hello.Michael?

26
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:25,080
Get up.

27
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:30,050
Turn around.

28
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,420
Turn around!

29
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,500
If you're going to murder us,alex

30
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:36,120
you're going to have to look us
in the eyes while you do it.

31
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:37,140
Shut up.

32
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:38,630
You want me,you got me.

33
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:39,850
Let my brother go!

34
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:41,120
I don't want either of you.

35
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:43,310
I just want my life back!

36
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:45,100
You're going to kill two innocent men to get it,huh?

37
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,700
Absolutely.

38
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:49,060
This is the united states border patrol.

39
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,680
Drop the weapon and remain where you are.

40
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:54,200
Drop your weapon.

41
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:58,150
United states border patrol.Drop your weapon.

42
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:03,800
I'm fbi.These men are in my custody.

43
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:04,960
I don't care who you are.

44
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,820
Until we verify,you will drop your weapon
or we will drop you.

45
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:11,490
Your choice.

46
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:32,070
Hands' on your head.Don't move.

47
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:40,320
You got anything to drink?

48
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:42,290
Check the back.

49
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:45,960
Unknown rider,unknown rider,this is dea on guard.

50
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,600
Bring up frequency 1145.

51
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,040
Uh-oh.

52
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,970
Uh-oh?

53
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:54,070
What do you mean,"uh-oh"?

54
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:56,030
Border patrol's on our ass,man.

55
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:58,420
How long till we get to mexico?

56
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:00,260
We're already in mexico,papa.

57
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:02,580
I thought they couldn't follow us
once we crossed the bord.

58
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:04,530
Hey,not since 9/11,hombre.

59
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,070
I repeat: This is dea on guard.

60
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:08,500
What are we going to do?

61
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,700
Pull the chord.

62
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:11,860
And pray.

63
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,550
Oh,hell,no.

64
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,750
Look,we try and land the plane,we're pinched for sure.

65
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,510
And if we jump?

66
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:20,550
We're in the middle of the desert.

67
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:24,160
Patrol have a hard time trying to find us once we land.

68
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:25,770
If we land.

69
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:27,270
Oh,you're going to land.

70
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,420
It's just a matter of how hard.

71
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:32,000
Good luck,amigo.

72
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:52,380
We're receiving reports that escaped convicts lincoln burrows

73
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:54,850
and michael scofield have been apprehended

74
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:57,230
just a few miles north of the us-mexican border.

75
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:00,640
Federal agent alex mahone with assistance from the united states

76
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:04,400
border patrol took the men into custody
just a short time ago.

77
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,570
Now,not a lot of information available at this time

78
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:08,600
but we do know the brothers were apprehended

79
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,880
without incident while attempting to leave the country

80
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,450
through the deserts of new mexico quite a long way

81
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,420
from illinois's fox river state penitentiary

82
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,960
where they escaped from less than ten days ago.

83
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:21,120
The fox river eight,as the group of
convicts were once known

84
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:24,980
are now down to four,as only benjamin miles franklin

85
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:30,000
fernando sucre,charles patoshik and
theodore bagwell remain at large.

86
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:34,800

'Scuse me,sarge.

92
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,570
I,uh,was wondering if you could,uh,help a brother out.

93
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:20,090
With what?

94
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:23,730
I only recently returned from delivering democracy

95
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:28,550
to the desert and,uh,I was wondering
if you could tell me

96
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:31,700
how a guy goes about getting a hold of one of those prosthetic jobbies.

97
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:34,960
What,they make you whole before they shipped you back?

98
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:37,180
Well,let's just say the doctor made the bed.

99
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,770
He just neglected to tuck in the sheets.

100
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:42,880
Best thing for you to do is go on down there to va.

101
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:44,500
Get in line.

102
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:46,760
That simple?

103
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:48,310
Yeah.

104
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:51,620
Till they send you the bill and you
got to figure out how to pay.

105
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,810
Those bastards up there in washington send us off

106
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:56,170
to fight for them; not a damn one of 'em fights for us.

107
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,340
And that is a crime.

108
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:01,740
But luckily for me,uh...

109
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:04,250
money is not the issue.

110
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:05,760
Is that right?

111
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:10,120
Any particular,uh,forms i might need in order to qualify?

112
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:13,410
You know what,mr.Don't ask,don't tell?

113
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:16,330
You figured out how to dye that hair of yours up like

114
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:19,360
like a nancy all by yourself,you sure as hell can figure out

115
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:23,150
how to get a prosthetic for that
stump of yours by yourself.

116
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:32,000
Yeah,I think I got a pretty good idea where to start.

JOLIET ILLINOIS
FOX RIVER STATE PENITENTIARY

119
00:06:47,145 --> 00:06:50,530
I'm here with ed pavelka,the new warden
of fox river penitentiary

120
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:53,260
where lincoln burrows and michael scofield are scheduled to

121
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:55,200
be returned to sometime tomorrow.

122
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:57,510
Now,warden,the escape happened a mere two days

123
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:59,960
before burrows was scheduled to be put to death.

124
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:03,260
He's already been granted one day;
do you anticipate any further?

125
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:06,330
Lincoln burrows is a convicted murderer.

126
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:10,510
His escape has endangered the lives of civilians across this country.

127
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:13,940
He is not a celebrity.
He is not a martyr.

128
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:17,720
I can assure you that whatever leniency was afforded him

129
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:22,350
and the her prisoners under the old regime at fox river
will no longer be tolerated.

130
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:25,550
The only thing that mr.Burrows can expect is

131
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:29,170
what a jury of his peers demanded: A speedy execution.

132
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,520
And michael scofield?

133
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:36,870
With his escape,the aiding and abetting charges
the felonies he's racked up along the way

134
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:40,790
on top of his original sentence
I'd say mr.Scofield will be spending

135
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:44,450
the rest of his life behind bars.Thank you.

Congratulations,sir.

142
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,480
What do you got?

143
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:29,790
A call from the illinois doc.

144
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:32,040
They're sending a huge contingent down
there to collect burrows

145
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:34,340
and scofield,take them back to fox river personally.

146
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:37,120
Remind them this is a federal case and
we'll handle the transport.Now...

147
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:40,640
I did.But it's an election year,collar this big
everybody wants a piece.

148
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:44,530
The warden called in a favor to the bureau chief;
he okayed it,so here we are.

149
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:46,630
Should be there in about an hour.

150
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:49,580
I want to be placed in the prisoner transport vehicle.

151
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,830
What for?

152
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:52,320
Just get it done.

153
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:55,050
Sir,these were the big fish.

154
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:56,560
And you brought 'em in.

155
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,850
You should feel good about that.

156
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:01,230
Yeah...

157
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:03,750
yeah.

158
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:06,460
Well,at least we're together.

159
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:08,780
Yes,there is that.

160
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,680
What are you thinking?

161
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,830
I'm thinking about the old man.

162
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:20,070
What he tried to do,you know.

163
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:25,320
Tough to go down swinging when you're locked in a box.

164
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,030
This isn't over yet.

165
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,460
We're entitled to a phone call.

166
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:33,240
We make that one call to sara and
she has the information dad said she has

167
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,900
we can get you exonerated before
this whole thing goes down.

168
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:36,870
No.

169
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,110
Hey.

170
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:42,240
We're entitled to a phone call.

171
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:46,610
You're entitled to precisely squat
until you're officially in custody.

172
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:49,320
And that won't happen until you're back in fox river.

173
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,260
So sit tight.

174
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:57,700
It's not over yeT.

175
00:09:57,770 --> 00:09:59,230
Not yet.

176
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:03,670
A lot of ground to cover between here and illinois.

177
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:09,020
I mean,what are the chances we even
make it back to fox river alive?

178
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:15,230
Saw you on the news,alex.

179
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,240
Did you?

180
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:17,680
The brothers too.

181
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:19,780
They were a little more,um...

182
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:22,580
breathing than I had hoped.

183
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,070
Yeah,well,border patrol showed up.
Nothing I could do.

184
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:26,520
Really?

185
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:30,380
Burrows and scofield,can you see them from where you are?

186
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:31,750
Yeah.

187
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:34,060
Then put a bullet in their heads.

188
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:36,770
They're being watched.

189
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,360
I don't care.

190
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:39,520
By armed guards.

191
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:41,720
They make it back to fox river,it is over.

192
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,180
For all of us.

193
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:46,110
There's not much more this country loves
than a bad man with a good story.

194
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:50,480
How much longer do you think it'll be before
someone puts a microphone in front of them?

195
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,920
Hey,are you listening?

196
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,650
Okay,with the security here,what you're asking me
to do is tantamount to suicide.

197
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:57,000
Do you understand what I'm saying?

198
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,980
I wasn't asking anything.

199
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:01,740
That would imply you had a say in the matter.

200
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:06,980
Pull this off and you're halfway home,alex.

201
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:10,680
You remember what home is like.Don't you?

202
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,220
900 west end avenuE.White fence.Red door.

203
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,960
Stay away from my family!

204
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,420
you got a little something on your,uh...

205
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:18,630
no,I...

206
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,090
here,let me.

207
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,540
Pardon my forwardness,I was...

208
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:25,980
it's okay.Thank you.

209
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:28,410
Normally I wouldn't intervene,it's just...

210
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:33,550
yesterday when I got home from work
I found what looked like

211
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:37,430
the brazilian rain forest lodged between my two front teeth.

212
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:42,300
And all I could think about was the number of
people who must've seen and not...

213
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:45,350
not a damn one of them had the decency to tell me.

214
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:49,160
Mild diastema.

215
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:50,870
Excuse me?

216
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:54,960
It's a slight gap between your eight and nine.

217
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:57,660
Your two front teeth.

218
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:01,230
And that it sometimes can act as a magnet for food like...

219
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:05,730
broccoli and tuna and sometimes rice.

220
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,140
Or relish.

221
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:09,670
All this and brains,too?

222
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,440
What are you,a dentist or...

223
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,500
Me?No,hardly,no.

224
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:14,900
I could never.

225
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:16,890
My ex,my ex-husband,he was...

226
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,550
a bastard?

227
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:21,300
That too.

228
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:32,550
Have you ever been to italy,uh...

229
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:34,250
Denise.

230
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:36,790
Denise,that's a lovely name.

231
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:45,400
you know,in italy,they have wine every day with lunch.

232
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:47,420
And what do we do in this country?

233
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:52,020
We power our food down with caffeine,carbonation
and high fructose corn syrup.

234
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:56,820
No one ever takes the time to enjoy things anymore.

235
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:09,140
Denise,would you do me the honor of "enjoying"
the rest of your lunch with me?

236
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,050
I think I'd like that.

237
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:17,800
White or red?

238
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:23,860
And with limited financial resources
he poses no flight risk...

239
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:27,660
unless he'd rather not stand trial for capital murder.

240
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:31,000
The defendant has shown great resourcefulness in

241
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:34,560
being able to travel across country with little money.

242
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:37,170
There's no reason he couldn't do it again.

243
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:41,810
If you don't want to believe me,believe mr.Bellick.

244
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:45,810
You thieving son of a bitch.

245
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,430
You better get down on your knees and pray to god that

246
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:53,010
I never find you because if I do,mark my words:
I will gut you bow to stern.

247
00:14:53,100 --> 00:15:01,190
he promised to kill mr.Geary
and then he kept that promisE.

248
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:06,640
A man like the defendant should not be out in society.

249
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:09,290
I concur.

250
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,450
Bail denied.

251
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:17,960
who would that be?

252
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,600
Only one person.

253
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:24,900
Michael,it's me.Listen,this phone rang last night and

254
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:29,510
I went to answer it,but I couldn't hear anything
and I-I nder if maybe it was you?

255
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:33,250
oh,god,I don't know what I should do right now.

256
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:34,150
I don't know if i should leave a message or
who might be listening to this,but...

257
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:38,220
um,I,uh...I need to know that you're okay.

258
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,730
I need you to know that I'm not.

259
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:43,340
I didn't leave you in gila.
Something happened to me and I don'T...

260
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,400
um,I don't know what to do right now.

261
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,400
I'm not too sure where to go,but I know that
you're the only person

262
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:51,760
I can trust and I need you to,um...

263
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:58,150
I need you to be okay and,um...

264
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:00,920
and I need you.

265
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:02,670
Please.

266
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:40,720
Alexander mahone,bureau.

267
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:45,140
These are my prisoners and I will be personally escorting them

268
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,580
in their transfer vehicle.

269
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:47,910
You can follow in the chase car...

270
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:50,030
I don't believe you heard me.

271
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:52,120
I'll be accompanying them in their...

272
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:55,250
the only people allowed in the van are the driver

273
00:17:55,340 --> 00:18:00,180
and two guards who've been trained
and certified in prison transport.

274
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:05,530
Are you really going to make me go over your head?

275
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,530
I'll even dial the phone for you.

276
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:11,470
Now look,this is standard procedure,agent mahone.

277
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:14,220
We need to keep that environment as controllable as possible.

278
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:17,260
The more bodies,the less control.

279
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:22,430
These men may have knowledge of the location of the other escapees.

280
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,830
this is knowledge that I...

281
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,140
I need to do my job.

282
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:30,880
And my job is to ensure the safe and
successful transfer of these two prisoners.

283
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:34,060
Chase vehicles are right outside.

284
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:47,350
We're coming to you live as brothers
lincoln burrows and michael scofield

285
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:49,720
are being led from the border patrol holding cell...

286
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:51,680
there better be a damn good reason
why those brothers are still alive.

287
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:53,270
Bad day,bill?

288
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:57,650
Sorry,I thought this was someone who still existed.

289
00:18:57,430 --> 00:18:59,330
How's the jerky business,owen?

290
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:01,260
Actually,it's looking pretty good right about now.

291
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,600
You call this number again,you're a dead man.

292
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:06,270
Actually,you don't kill burrows and scofield today
so are you.

293
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:10,610
You know it and I know it,and luckily for you
I know how to save your ass.

294
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,930
The brothers are already being transferred.

295
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,800
You're too late.

296
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:22,290
Actually,that transport van is exactly
where you want them to be,bill.

297
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:25,100
Why?

298
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:26,610
Why?

299
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,430
You want my help,bill,I want my job back.

300
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,480
That means direct access to the president.

301
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,220
I report only to her.

302
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:33,760
You're reaching,paul.

303
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:34,730
Good-bye.

304
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,090
Don't shut me out,bill.

305
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:38,780
You think burrows and scofield are a threat to this administration?

306
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:41,730
I know everything caroline reynolds has done.

307
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:43,550
Everything.

308
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:46,280
Now,before you panic,all I'm asking

309
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:49,380
is to be allowed to finish the job that I started.

310
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,600
To prove to the president and to you

311
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:54,860
that I'm still an asset to this administration.

312
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,300
What's your plan?

313
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:02,830
I have an old associate in the illinois doc.

314
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,270
They're heading up the transfer.

315
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:06,420
It's going to take more than one guy on the inside.

316
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:09,220
Not if the guy's in the right place.

317
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:11,580
Bill,you give me the go-ahead on this

318
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:13,410
when those brothers get in the van

319
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:15,800
it'll be the last thing they ever do.

320
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:42,519
I have never done that before.

321
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:48,589
Then I guess we were making
up for some lost time.

322
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,889
I have to ask,sam,are you,uh...

323
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:57,499
- are you married or something?
- Me? No.

324
00:20:57,530 --> 00:20:59,179
- What makes you think...
- Come on.

325
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:01,139
I may be plain,but I'm not a fool.

326
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:04,829
Usually the men I end up with are
just looking for something,you know...

327
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:07,519
on the side.

328
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,389
Denise,the only "side" I'm interested in,

329
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:17,039
is the inside.and that place within you...

330
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:20,449
is not plain.

331
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,689
I have to get back to work.

332
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:25,019
Do you really?

333
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:27,399
I have to close tonight.

334
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,009
How 'bout I pick you up after?

335
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:32,029
We can have dinner.

336
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:34,909
- Are you sure?
- Denise...

337
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,549
I insist.

338
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,469
Good news.

339
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:56,459
You're off the hook.

340
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:59,939
Paul kellerman has a team ready to move
on the caravan just outside of albuquerque.

341
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,419
Okay.

342
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:02,679
So where does that leave us?

343
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:06,049
When it goes down,there's sure
to be a moment or two of chaos.

344
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:10,199
A certain amount of
confusion,lots of bullets flying.

345
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:14,919
I need you there to make sure
paul kellerman catches one.

346
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:20,719
It's a little early to be
covering your tracks,isn't it?

347
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:23,809
The escapees--
that was our deal.

348
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:24,989
That's all.

349
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:26,549
Right.

350
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:28,939
Our deal.

351
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:34,999
Refresh my memory.Was our deal supposed to end
with burrows and scofield going back to prison or...

352
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:38,009
bleeding from a hole in their heads?

353
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:41,719
We're giving you a chance
to make this right,alex.

354
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,319
Just let kellerman take care of it.

355
00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:45,199
Let him be our oswald.

356
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:46,989
Then,that makes me your jack ruby.

357
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:48,999
Jack ruby was working alone.

358
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:53,299
You've got the support of the united
states government behind you,alex.

359
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:56,019
Good luck in albuquerque.

360
00:22:59,216 --> 00:23:00,992
(Retire Kellerman)

361
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:08,319
I promise,sir,this will all be over shortly

362
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:11,179
and it will be back to business as usual.

363
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:17,099
Do you regret it?

364
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:18,779
What?

365
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:23,639
Knowing what you know
now,do you regret helping me?

366
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:26,639
You'd have done the same thing for me.

367
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:29,079
You think?

368
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,549
I know.

369
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:35,209
You didn't answer the question.

370
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,879
I don't regret the act.

371
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:43,769
Just how it turned out.

372
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:48,249
We've got a premeditated
murder on our hands.

373
00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:50,719
You wanted to steal money and
then kill the only witness.

374
00:23:50,770 --> 00:23:53,289
Are you my attorney or theirs?
I told you I didn't do anything.

375
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:55,989
No,I'm just explaining their
theory of what happened.

376
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:58,489
Your explanation to the cops
that you didn't kill geary

377
00:23:58,530 --> 00:24:02,709
because you were too busy trying to steal
five million in federally insured money.

378
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:05,259
Probably not the best move.

379
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,259
But there is good news.

380
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,469
What's that?

381
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,729
The da is willing to offer a deal.

382
00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:12,439
25 years.

383
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:13,729
No.

384
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:15,849
Brad,they'll drop the capital charge.

385
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,119
No death penalty.

386
00:24:17,170 --> 00:24:18,679
No.

387
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,369
I'd be almost 65 when I get out.

388
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:22,199
But you'd get out.

389
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:27,339
If this case goes to trial,there's an
excellent chance you're sentenced to death.

390
00:24:27,410 --> 00:24:29,919
Now,I've been doing this a
while,brad,and I can tell you

391
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:33,009
these things never go down good.

392
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:38,139
When the system wants you,they
get you,one way or another.

393
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:48,719
Part of the deal's got to
be I do my time in illinois,

394
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:51,459
so i can be with my mom.

395
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:12,039
Where are they taking us?

396
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:13,509
Another foster home.

397
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:15,899
I don't want to go.I liked it there.

398
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:17,459
I know you did.

399
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:18,599
It's 'cause of you.

400
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:21,009
The reason they're making us move,isn't it?

401
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:23,209
'Cause you were getting in trouble again.

402
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:26,149
Yeah,and I'm sorry.

403
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:35,119
Seems like I've been dragging
you into trouble my whole life.

404
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:37,949
Pulled me out of some,too.

405
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:06,749
Alex.Paul kellerman.

406
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:08,499
Have you spoken with bill kim?

407
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:12,699
Yeah,he filled me in.You're
staging in albuquerque.

408
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:14,159
Now,listen.

409
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:18,269
Me jumping in at this point.It in no way reflects
my feelings about the job you've been doing.

410
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:20,419
I just wanted you to know that.

411
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:23,299
Of course.

412
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:25,319
So long as we get the job done.

413
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:28,029
And we all get to go back
to our families,right?

414
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,999
The sooner the better.

415
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:32,629
So what do I need to know?

416
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:07,749
Albuquerque,new mexico

417
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:49,609
What's going on out there?

418
00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:51,329
Let me go check.

419
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:57,499
what do you see?I'll let you know.

420
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:03,679
How much time is it going
to take to move the semi?

421
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:06,139
I've got my men working on it now.

422
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,719
What's going on up there?

423
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:18,719
Are you in a hurry,convict?

424
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:23,769
Hey,we need some help getting
this rig out of the road.

425
00:28:28,770 --> 00:28:31,119
Linc.

426
00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:42,699
All right,let's say we get
the cuffs off.Where do we go?

427
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:45,089
There.

428
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:47,299
That's too easy.

429
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:51,619
Come on.Come on,michael,take it.

430
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:56,349
Come on,come on.

431
00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:01,489
Take it.

432
00:29:03,770 --> 00:29:06,919
Take it and run.

433
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:21,419
let's think about this.

434
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:25,619
The keys are accidentally left
out,the door is accidentally left open.

435
00:29:25,650 --> 00:29:27,939
- It's our only shot.
- It's their only shot.

436
00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:30,489
They don't have an excuse to
kill us unless we give it to them.

437
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:31,329
How are we doing?

438
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:32,579
Mahone: Nothing so far.

439
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:33,989
None?

440
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:35,819
They're talking,that's all.

441
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:39,369
If they haven't bitten in five minutes,you
haul the semi,you tell them it's fixed.

442
00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:40,639
You release traffic.

443
00:29:40,690 --> 00:29:41,749
And do what?

444
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:45,389
If you want the rabbit to
hop,you move the carrot,alex.

445
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,329
You showed.

446
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:09,799
A gentleman always does.

447
00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:11,479
Where are we going to eat?

448
00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:13,509
Wherever your heart desires.

449
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:18,699
You know,there's just one teensy-tiny
thing I been meaning to ask.

450
00:30:19,770 --> 00:30:22,039
Anything.

451
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:27,989
You know,forwarding addresses
are supposed to be confidential.

452
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:30,499
I really shouldn't be doing this.

453
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:35,559
you shouldn't have been doing a lot of
the things we did this afternoon,but,uh,

454
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:39,439
neither of us has been smited down yet.

455
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:42,629
There she is.

456
00:30:43,670 --> 00:30:48,039
I'd imagine your cousin'll be pretty surprised
to hear about the money her uncle left her.

457
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:50,469
You can be certain of it.

458
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:57,889
Sam,I hope you don't mind me asking,but,um,

459
00:30:57,930 --> 00:30:59,989
your hand.

460
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:02,489
What happened to it?

461
00:31:02,930 --> 00:31:08,429
I'm sorry.I didn't want to make you
feel uncomfortable or nothing.I just...

462
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,709
I want to know you.

463
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:13,879
I want to know everything about you,and...

464
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:22,719
if this is a part of who you
are,then I want to know how it--

465
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:25,469
oh,dear god.

466
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:35,809
I really wish you hadn't seen that.

467
00:31:58,450 --> 00:31:59,609
Okay,here's what I'm thinking.

468
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:02,549
You and some of the boys get
yourselves transferred over to ad seg.

469
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:05,179
That way,we can spend our days playing
scrabble and watching sportscenter.

470
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:06,239
Look,cap'N...

471
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:09,999
then,in about a year and a half or so,you're gonna
recommend me for one of those work-release programs.

472
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:13,279
Then,I can sweat off the rest of
my time heaving hay and getting sun.

473
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:15,679
- That's...
- it ain't freedom,but it's damn close.

474
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:17,639
Is that why you requested to be sent here?

475
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:21,279
I go anywhere else-- as
a former co,I'm dead man.

476
00:32:21,290 --> 00:32:23,169
But here I got men to watch my back.

477
00:32:23,210 --> 00:32:26,399
- Get me the finest accommodations...
- they're not putting you in ad seg.

478
00:32:26,450 --> 00:32:28,419
I don'care where they're putting
me.Just take me to ad seg.

479
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:30,249
It's not like it used to be,cap'N.

480
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:32,149
The cos don't run the game here anymore.

481
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:33,669
- What do you mean?
- This new warden.

482
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:35,219
He's cracking down.

483
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:38,969
And to prove he's serious about
showing preferential treatment,

484
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,869
he's making an example out of you.

485
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:46,219
Lou,what the hell is this?

486
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:48,539
General pop.

487
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:07,039
Welcome home,

488
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:09,689
boss.

489
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:42,459
sonoran desert,mexico 40miles
south of the us/mexico border

490
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:20,589
okay,everybody,we're moving out.

491
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:34,619
Window's closi,michael.Once
the truck moves,we're...

492
00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:37,649
if we run now,we give them permission
to put a bullet in our heads.

493
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:40,839
We stay,I'm dead within the
week,and you're locked up for life.

494
00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:42,999
Or until they find a way to get to you.

495
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:44,109
And,believe me,they will.

496
00:35:44,130 --> 00:35:46,679
If we go back to prison,we'll
have a few extra days.

497
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:48,209
We'll have a chance to contact sara.

498
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,669
We don't know where sara is.

499
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:52,119
Sara may be dead,michael.

500
00:35:53,810 --> 00:35:56,549
Let me get us out of here
the only way I know how.

501
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:58,529
Fighting?

502
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:06,379
Get the keys.

503
00:36:11,610 --> 00:36:13,339
Here we go.Here we go.

504
00:36:13,370 --> 00:36:15,329
Copyhat.

505
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:18,219
All right,we're on.Heads up.

506
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:21,079
Hold traffic.

507
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:36,529
You know we have no idea
what's behind that door.

508
00:36:37,310 --> 00:36:39,349
Nope.

509
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:41,819
You ready?

510
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:43,089
No.You?

511
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:45,489
No.

512
00:36:45,850 --> 00:36:48,429
Let's go.

513
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:33,559
Just pray there's another way out of here.

514
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:54,989
xxx

515
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:30,799
Hey,they're in.

516
00:38:30,830 --> 00:38:32,109
And they're heading straight for you.

517
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,369
Armed?

518
00:38:33,370 --> 00:38:35,669
No.Where are you?I'll back you up.

519
00:38:35,690 --> 00:38:38,979
Just keep moving.As long as they're
running from you,they're running toward me.

520
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:41,049
They're boxed in.

521
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:46,079
ness city,kansas

522
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:13,029
Hold on one sec.

523
00:39:14,130 --> 00:39:16,449
Can I write a check for the
food?'Cause I don't have...

524
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:19,019
hello,mrs.Hollander.

525
00:39:19,070 --> 00:39:21,889
They say a good woman is hard to find.

526
00:39:21,930 --> 00:39:27,179
Well,if that's true,you must be very,very...

527
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:29,009
very good.

528
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:31,229
Don't be frightened.

529
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:34,389
Teddy's home.

530
00:40:21,870 --> 00:40:24,869
They're improvising,heading
toward the surface.

531
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:37,679
Where to?

532
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:38,819
I don't know.

533
00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:40,709
Look,if something happens to us

534
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:44,609
if we get separated or one of us doesn't
make it,promise me you'll find sara.

535
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,789
We're gonna make it.Just promise me.

536
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:48,689
I promisE.Come on.

537
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,079
President reynolds ruined your life.

538
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:23,249
She ruined my life.

539
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:25,209
You want to take that bitch down?

540
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:29,159
You just found your inside
man,but it's got to be right now.

541
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:30,879
Let's go.

542
00:42:30,910 --> 00:42:33,169
