00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:03,800
《越狱》前情回顾
Previously on Prison Break

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:07,190
我们要留下
We're staying.

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,060
让他们见鬼去
Give 'em hell.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,150
比尔别这样
Phil, don't do this.

5
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,920
我把自己的一生都献给了这个国家
I've dedicated my life to this country.

6
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:20,250
还有卡罗琳
And Caroline

7
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:21,450
每张照片
Every photo,

8
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:22,550
每一份资料 全都消除掉
every file... get rid of it all.

9
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,550
比尔别这么做
Phil, don't do this.

10
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:25,920
你给盖瑞先生留了言
You left a message for Mr. Geary.

11
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:28,390
我会找到你的  你最好祈祷吧
I'm going to gut you, bow to stern.

12
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,990
我没有杀罗伊 盖瑞
I did not kill Roy Geary.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,620
-巴格威尔陷害了我    -现在以一级谋杀罪
-Bagwell set me up.  -You are under

14
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:32,490
逮捕你
arrest  for the first degree murder

15
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:33,750
涉嫌杀害罗伊 盖瑞
of Roy William Geary.

16
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,290
我的心理医生跟我说
My therapist said

17
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:36,450
我必须要来面对你
that I need to confront you to

18
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:40,450
让你知道我有多么地感觉到自己被欺骗
let you know how betrayed I feel.

19
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:42,090
我们是警察
This is the Tribune police.

20
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:44,650
只要你做好你的事   我们就不会记得查尔斯 奥斯卡的事
Look, as long as you do your job with me, not a chance.

21
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:45,950
你也好回科罗拉多
And then you can go back to Colorado

22
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,600
去看你的儿子  还有家人
and visit your son and family.

23
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:52,590
不许你再提起他的名字
Don't you ever mention his name again.

24
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,250
后面有人在追我们怎么办?
What about your friend back there?

25
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:55,920
如果我们要越境...
If we're going to go down...

26
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:58,060
也许我们可以大摇大摆地过去
might as well go down swinging.

27
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:06,930
-莎拉    -迈克尔
-Sara.   -Michael?

28
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,490
差点就成了是吧?
Almost made it.

29
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,320
有人吗?
Hello.

30
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:20,620
是你吗  迈克尔?
Hello. Michael?

31
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:24,600
起来
Get up.

32
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:29,120
转过去
Turn around.

33
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:30,190
转过去!
Turn around!

34
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,050
如果你想杀了我们  阿力克斯
If you're going to murder us, Alex

35
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:33,790
动手的时候你应该盯着
you're going to have to look us

36
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,850
-我们的双眼      -闭嘴
in the eyes while you do it.     Shut up.

37
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:36,720
你要的是我  你也抓到我了
You want me, you got me.

38
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:38,820
- 让我弟弟走    - 你们俩我谁也不要
Let my brother go!   I don't want either of you.

39
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:40,020
我只是想要回我的生活!
I just want my life back!

40
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:43,050
那你打算杀掉两个无辜的人来换取?
You're going to kill two innocent men to get it, huh?

41
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:44,590
你说的没错
Absolutely.

42
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,450
我们是美国边境巡逻队
This is the United States Border Patrol.

43
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:51,130
放下武器并且站在原地
Drop the weapon and remain where you are.

44
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:53,490
美国边境巡逻队
United States Border Patrol.

45
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:58,530
扔下你的武器
Drop your weapon.

46
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,850
我是联邦探员  这些人是我的囚犯
I'm FBI. These men are in my custody.

47
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:02,920
我不管你是谁
I don't care who you are.

48
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:04,350
在我们查清楚之前
Until we verify,

49
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,850
把武器放下
you will drop your weapon

50
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,820
不然我们就把你放倒
or we will drop you.

51
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:10,960
你自己决定
Your choice.

52
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,100
把双手放在头上
Hands' on your head. Don't move.

53
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:38,150
有什么喝的吗?
You got anything to drink?

54
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,850
在后面找找
Check the back.

55
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:42,390
不明飞机  不明飞机
Unknown rider, unknown rider,

56
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,620
我们是缉毒组的
this is dea on guard.

57
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:48,150
立刻转到电台1145频率
Bring up frequency 1145.

58
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,390
啊哦!
Uh-oh.

59
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,720
啊哦?
Uh-oh?

60
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:52,050
什么意思?
What do you mean,"uh-oh"?

61
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:54,620
边境巡逻队追上我们了
Border patrol's on our ass, man.

62
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:55,950
我们还要多久才到墨西哥?
How long till we get to Mexico?

63
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,190
我们已经在墨西哥了  哥们儿
We're already in Mexico, papa.

64
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,350
我以为他们不能再追我们了
I thought they couldn't follow us

65
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,320
我们都跨过边境了
once we crossed the bord.

66
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:02,450
911以后就不再是这样了  兄弟
Hey, not since 9/11,hombre.

67
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:05,250
我们是缉毒组的
I repeat: This is dea on guard.

68
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:07,220
我们该怎么办?
What are we going to do?

69
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:09,720
唱圣歌并祈祷吧
Pull the chord, and pray.

70
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:12,090
才不要
Oh,hell, no.

71
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:14,050
如果我们试图降落这飞机      就肯定会被抓
Look,we try and land the plane,we're pinched for sure.

72
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,890
那如果我们跳伞呢?
And if we jump?

73
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,820
我们在沙漠的正中间
We're in the middle of the desert.

74
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:21,920
巡逻队要想发现我们得花上不少时间
Patrol have a hard time trying to find us once we land.

75
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:23,790
前提是我们能降落
If we land.

76
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,320
你肯定会降落的
Oh, you're going to land.

77
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:26,920
差别就是你怎么降落
It's just a matter of how hard.

78
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:31,360
祝你好运  兄弟
Good luck, amigo.

79
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:48,490
我们收到报告
We're receiving reports that

80
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,720
逃犯林肯・布伦斯和迈克尔・斯科菲尔德
escaped convicts Lincoln Burrows

81
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:54,990
在距离美墨边境以北几英里处刚刚被抓获
and Michael Scofield have been apprehended

82
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,850
联邦探员阿力克斯・马宏
Federal agent Alex Mahone

83
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:59,450
在美国边境巡逻队的帮助下
with assistance from the United States Border Patrol

84
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:02,290
在不久前将两人关押
took the men into custody just a short time ago.

85
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:04,620
现在很多消息都不明朗
Now, not a lot of information available at this time

86
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:07,320
但我们知道兄弟俩的被捕并非意外
but we do know the brothers were apprehended without incident

87
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,030
他们在试图穿越新墨西哥沙漠并离开美国 
while attempting to leave the country through

88
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:10,650
距离伊利诺伊州千里之外的地方被逮到了
the deserts of New Mexico quite a long way

89
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:13,450
也就是不到10天前他们
from Illinois's Fox River State Penitentiary

90
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:16,150
逃出的福克斯河监狱
where they escaped from less than ten days ago.

91
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,350
现在我们知道福克斯河的8名逃犯
The Fox River eight, as the group of convicts were once known

92
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,890
只剩4人在逃
are now down to four,

93
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:22,650
也就是本杰明麦尔斯・富兰克林
as only Benjamin Miles Franklin

94
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:24,770
费尔南多・苏克雷 查尔斯・波多斯基
Fernando Sucre, Charles Patoshik

95
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:26,020
还有西奥多・巴格威尔
and Theodore Bagwell

96
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:27,750
依然在逃
remain at large.

97
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,390
长官
Sir.

98
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,650
他刚听说了
He just heard.

99
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:34,160
而且他想见你
And he'd like to see you.

100
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:40,490
现在只剩4名逃犯
Convicts are now down to four

101
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:44,490
也就是本杰明麦尔斯・富兰克林
as only Benjamin Miles Franklin

102
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,520
费尔南多・苏克雷  查尔斯・波多斯基
Fernando sucre, Charles Patoshik

103
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,320
还有西奥多・巴格威尔依然在逃
and Theodore Bagwell remain at large.

104
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:50,800
一路顺风  先生们
Godspeed, gentlemen.

105
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:13,250
打扰下  士官
'Scuse me, sarge.

106
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:16,590
我在想不知道你能不能帮兄弟一个忙
I, uh, was wondering if you could, uh, help a brother out.

107
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,090
什么忙?
With what?

108
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:22,620
我刚刚从沙漠地区推广民主回来(伊拉克战争)
I only recently returned from delivering democracy to the desert and,

109
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:26,420
我在想你能不能告诉我
uh, I was wondering if you could tell me

110
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:29,590
什么地方能够做个假手臂吗？
how a guy goes about getting a hold of one of those prosthetic jobbies.

111
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,920
怎么在把你送回来前他们没把你整好?
What, they make you whole before they shipped you back?

112
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:35,150
打个比方吧  医生光知道铺床
Well, let's just say the doctor made the bed.

113
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,550
但却不叠被子(做事情半调子)
He just neglected to tuck in the sheets.

114
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,220
最好的办法就是去退伍军人服务处
Best thing for you to do is go on down there to va.

115
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:42,790
在那儿排队
Get in line.

116
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,890
-就这么简单?     -没错
That simple?     Yeah.

117
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,920
直到他们寄给你帐单
Till they send you the bill

118
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:49,820
而你则得去想办法怎么付钱
and you got to figure out how to pay.

119
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:52,960
华盛顿那帮畜牲把我们送出去为他们卖命  
Those bastards up there in Washington send us off to fight for them;

120
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,220
却没人为我们卖命
not a damn one of 'em fights for us.

121
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:56,220
这简直就是犯罪
And that is a crime.

122
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:59,890
但对我来说走运的是
But luckily for me, uh...

123
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:02,090
钱不是问题
money is not the issue.

124
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,620
是吗?
Is that right?

125
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:08,050
在此之前我是不是有什么特别的表格要填?
Any particular, uh, forms I might need in order to qualify?

126
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:11,120
你知道吗  啥也不问啥也不说先生?
You know what, Mr. Don't ask, don't tell?

127
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:14,390
既然你有办法自己把头发染成那样
You figured out how to dye that hair of yours up like

128
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,420
跟个娘门儿似的
like a nancy all by yourself,

129
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:20,000
你肯定也有办法为你自己那断手接个假肢
you sure as hell can figure out how to get a prosthetic for that stump of ...

130
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:29,060
是啊  我想我知道该怎么做了
Yeah, I think I got a pretty good idea where to start.

131
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,500
拉斯克鲁斯  新墨西哥州   边境巡逻队哨所基地

伊利诺伊州 朱丽 福克斯河州立监狱
JOLIET ILLINOIS  Fox River STATE PENITENTIARY

133
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,820
现在在我身边的是

00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:46,250
埃德 普维卡  福克斯河监狱的

00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,790
将于明天某些时候被遣返的地方
be returned to sometime tomorrow.

138
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,790
狱长  越狱发生于林肯・布伦斯
Now, warden, the escape happened a mere two days

139
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,020
将被执行死刑的前2天
before Burrows was scheduled to be put to death.

140
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:58,450
他本来就还有1天时间
He's already been granted one day

141
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:01,150
你认为他是否还会有更多的时间?
do you anticipate any further?

142
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:04,120
林肯・布伦斯是一名已经判决的谋杀犯
Lincoln Burrows is a convicted murderer.

143
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:05,650
他的逃脱
His escape

144
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:07,620
使全国平民的生命处于危险之中
has endangered the lives of civilians across this country.

145
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:09,020
他不是个名人
He is not a celebrity.

146
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:11,120
也不是个烈士
He is not a martyr.

147
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:14,990
我可以向你保证不管之前  他受到多少宽容的对待
I can assure you that whatever leniency was afforded him

148
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,390
还有在福克斯河旧管理阶层之下的其他犯人们
and the her prisoners under the old regime at Fox River

149
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,220
所有行为都不会再得到容忍
will no longer be tolerated.

150
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:23,990
等待布伦斯先生的  将是陪审团所要求的
The only thing that Mr. Burrows can expect is

151
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,650
迅速执行死刑
what a jury of his peers demanded: A speedy execution.

152
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:28,350
那迈克尔 斯克菲尔德呢?
And Michael Scofield?

153
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,350
因为他设计的越狱
With his escape,

154
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,350
帮助并且教唆
the aiding and abetting charges the felonies

155
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,820
那些他纠集起来的犯人
he's racked up along the way

156
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:36,490
加上他原来所犯的罪行    恐怕斯克菲尔德先生
on top of his original sentence, I'd say Mr. Scofield will be spending

157
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:39,690
必须要在监狱里度过余生了
the rest of his life behind bars.

158
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:42,700
谢谢
Thank you.

159
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:20,340
芝加哥  FBI指挥中心
CHICAGO ILLNOIS   FBI FIELD OFFICE

160
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:24,310
谁来接马宏的电话?
Who's got Mahone?

161
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:25,700
恭喜你  长官
Congratulations, sir.

162
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:27,340
你们收到什么了?
What do you got?

163
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:29,500
从伊利诺伊监狱部门打来的电话
A call from the Illinois doc.

164
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:31,370
他们派了一大队人马
They're sending a huge contingent

165
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:33,440
来接布伦斯和斯科菲尔德 然后把他们带回福克斯河
down there to collect Burrows and Scofield, take them back to Fox River personally.

166
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:35,000
告诉他们这是联邦案件
Remind them this is a federal case and

167
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:37,040
我们会负责犯人的转移工作  现在...
we'll handle the transport. Now...

168
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:39,400
我说了  但今年是选举年  蛋糕很大
I did. But it's an election year, collar this big

169
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:41,340
每个人都想分一杯羹  新狱长直接
everybody wants a piece. The warden called in a favor

170
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:44,540
向联邦调查局长要的  他同意了       所以我们就照办
to the bureau chief; he okayed it, so here we are.

171
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:46,200
他们大概一小时后应该到了
Should be there in about an hour.

172
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:48,300
我要进到
I want to be placed in the

173
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:49,500
犯人押送车里
prisoner transport vehicle.

174
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:50,670
为什么?
What for?

175
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,000
你照办就是了
Just get it done.

176
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:54,870
长官  这些可是大鱼
Sir, these were the big fish.

177
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,340
你把他们抓住了
And you brought 'em in.

178
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:59,470
你应该为此感到高兴
You should feel good about that.

179
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,300
是啊...
Yeah...

180
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:04,700
是啊
yeah.

181
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,540
至少我们还在一起
Well, at least we're together.

182
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:11,280
是啊至少如此
Yes, there is that.

183
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,300
你在想什么?
What are you thinking?

184
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:16,640
我在想老爸
I'm thinking about the old man.

185
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:21,050
他试图做的那些事  你知道
What he tried to do, you know.

186
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:26,150
当你被关在笼子里你就 不可能大摇大摆地走了
Tough to go down swinging when you're locked in a box.

187
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:27,540
一切都还没结束呢
This isn't over yet.

188
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:29,340
我们有权打个电话
We're entitled to a phone call.

189
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:31,840
我们给莎拉打个电话  而她有那些信息
We make that one call to Sara and she has the information

190
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:33,240
爸爸说她有
dad said she has

191
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:34,470
我们可以在这一切继续下去之前
we can get you exonerated before

192
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,410
-让你无罪释放   -别
-this whole thing goes down.    -No.

193
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:42,170
我们有权打个电话
We're entitled to a phone call.

194
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,600
你们有权乖乖的蹲在那里
You're entitled to precisely squat

195
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:46,440
直到你们被正式拘捕
until you're officially in custody.

196
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:48,940
而那必须要等你们被送回福克斯河之后
And that won't happen until you're back in Fox River.

197
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:52,910
所以去老实坐着
So sit tight.

198
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:57,400
还没结束
It's not over yet.

199
00:09:57,410 --> 00:10:00,900
还没
Not yet.

200
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:03,100
从这里到伊利诺伊州还有好多路要赶
A lot of ground to cover between here and Illinois.

201
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:05,240
我是说
I mean,

202
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:10,150
我们能活着回到福克斯河的机会有多大呢?
what are the chances we even make it back to Fox River alive?

203
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:14,840
在电视上看到你了  阿力克斯
Saw you on the news, Alex.

204
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:16,000
是吗?
Did you?

205
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:17,440
还有那两兄弟
The brothers too.

206
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,700
他们比我盼望见到的要...
They were a little more, um...

207
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:22,370
更生龙活虎了一点
breathing than I had hoped.

208
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:24,440
边境巡逻队突然出现  我无能为力
Yeah, well, border patrol showed up. Nothing I could do.

209
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:25,970
真的吗?
Really?

210
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:28,440
布伦斯和斯科菲尔德
Burrows and Scofield,

211
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:30,000
从你站的地方能看到他们吗?
can you see them from where you are?

212
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:31,470
可以
Yeah.

213
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:34,470
那动手杀了他们
Then put a bullet in their heads.

214
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,040
他们被看护着
They're being watched.

215
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:38,070
我不管
I don't care.

216
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,470
是武装了的守卫
By armed guards.

217
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,600
如果让他们回到福克斯河      一切都完了
They make it back to Fox River, it is over.

218
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:42,800
我们都完了
For all of us.

219
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:44,150
在这个国家里没有什么 
There's not much more this country loves

220
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:46,100
比一个有好故事的坏人更吸引人的了
than a bad man with a good story.

221
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:50,400
你觉得在有人给他们发言的机会前我们还有多少时间?
How much longer do you think it'll be before someone puts a microphone ...

222
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:51,500
你在听吗?
Hey, are you listening?

223
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:53,140
好吧  这里有如此多的警卫
Okay, with the security here,

224
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:55,200
你要我做的事情等于自杀
what you're asking me to do is tantamount to suicide.

225
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:56,440
你明白我在说什么吗?
Do you understand what I'm saying?

226
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:58,400
我不是在要求你去做什么事
I wasn't asking anything.

227
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:02,780
那样会让你觉得你还有说话的余地
That would imply you had a say in the matter.

228
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:07,900
解决这些事  你就差不多可以回家了      阿力克斯
Pull this off and you're halfway home, Alex.

229
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:10,800
你还记得家是什么样吧  是吗?
You remember what home is like. Don't you?

230
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:14,140
西头大街900号 白色栅栏  红色的门
900 west end Avenue. White fence. Red door.

231
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:17,950
离我家人远点!
Stay away from my family!

232
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:17,570
有点东西粘在你的...
You got a little something on your, uh...

233
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:21,610
不是...我来帮你吧
here, let me.

234
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,070
原谅我的直接  我...
Pardon my forwardness, I was...

235
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:26,500
没关系  谢谢你
it's okay. Thank you.

236
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:28,700
一般情况下我是不会管的  只是...
Normally I wouldn't intervene, it's just...

237
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:31,870
昨天我下班回家后
yesterday when I got home from work

238
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,170
我发现看上去好象
I found what looked like

239
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:34,940
巴西的热带丛林
the brazilian rain forest

240
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:36,900
卡在我的两颗门牙之间
lodged between my two front teeth.

241
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:39,270
我能想到的就是
And all I could think about

242
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:42,300
肯定有很多人看见了...
was the number of people who must've seen and not...

243
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:46,780
却没有一个人能好心地告诉我
not a damn one of them had the decency to tell me.

244
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,900
微度齿隙
Mild diastema.

245
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:50,570
什么?
Excuse me?

246
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:52,770
在你的8号和9号齿之间
It's a slight gap between

247
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:55,300
有一个小的缝隙
your eight and nine.

248
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:57,600
就是你的两颗门牙
Your two front teeth.

249
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,440
有时候它就会象磁铁一样
And that it sometimes can act as a magnet

250
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:01,770
把一些食物...
for food like...

251
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:05,600
象椰菜  吞拿鱼还有米
broccoli and tuna and sometimes rice.

252
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:07,300
或者一些调料吸进去
Or relish.

253
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:09,370
你这些都知道?
All this and brains, too?

254
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:11,040
你是牙医还是什么...?
What are you, a dentist or...

255
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:13,170
我?不是  当然不是
Me? No, hardly, no.

256
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:14,670
我不可能是
I could never.

257
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,540
我的前夫  他是...
My ex, my ex-husband, he was...

258
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:19,140
混球?
a bastard?

259
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:23,110
没错
That too.

260
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:32,100
你去过意大利吗 恩...?
Have you ever been to italy, uh...

261
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:34,440
- 丹妮斯   - 丹妮斯
Denise. Denise,

262
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:38,580
真是个好听的名字
that's a lovely name.

263
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:41,270
你知道  在意大利
You know, in italy,

264
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:45,340
他们每天中餐都要有葡萄酒
they have wine every day with lunch.

265
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:46,940
而在我们这个国家呢?
And what do we do in this country?

266
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:49,540
我们靠咖啡因和碳酸来下饭
We power our food down with caffeine, carbonation

267
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:52,100
还有高热果糖和糖浆
and high fructose corn syrup.

268
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:57,910
没人再花时间来享受了
No one ever takes the time to enjoy things anymore.

269
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:01,700
丹妮斯  你是否愿意
Denise, would you do me the honor

270
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:04,940
和我一起来享受
of "enjoying"

271
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:10,110
剩下的午餐?
the rest of your lunch with me?

272
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:14,140
我想我会喜欢的
I think I'd like that.

273
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:17,440
白酒还是红酒?
White or red?

274
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:20,600
堪萨斯州 克雷县    地方法院

275
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:22,100
在有限的经济条件下
And with limited financial resources

276
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:24,340
他不可能有坐飞机逃跑的可能...
he poses no flight risk...

277
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:25,470
除非他不愿意
unless he'd rather not

278
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,170
接受谋杀审讯
stand trial for capital murder.

279
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:30,700
被告已经显示了他在有限的经济条件下
The defendant has shown great resourcefulness in

280
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:32,040
穿越全国的能力
being able to travel across country

281
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:34,240
仅用了很少的钱
with little money.

282
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:37,240
没理由说他不会再做一遍
There's no reason he couldn't do it again.

283
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:38,970
如果你们不相信我
If you don't want to believe me,

284
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:43,080
相信贝利克先生自己的话吧
believe Mr. Bellick.

285
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:45,240
你个该死的杂种
You thieving son of a bitch.

286
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:47,200
你最好跪下向上帝祈祷
You better get down on your knees and pray to god that

287
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:48,840
最好别让我找到  因为一旦让我找到
I never find you because if I do,

288
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:50,640
记住我的话  我会
mark my words: I will

289
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:54,250
把你开膛破肚
gut you bow to stern.

290
00:14:56,050 --> 00:14:59,100
他保证了要杀死盖瑞先生
He promised to kill Mr. Geary

291
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:00,770
并且信守了自己的诺言
and then he kept that promise.

292
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:03,240
象被告这样的人
A man like the defendant

293
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:07,610
不应该被留在社会上
should not be out in society.

294
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,100
我同意
I concur.

295
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:13,010
不许保释
Bail denied.

296
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:18,100
会是谁?
Who would that be?

297
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:21,800
只会是一个人
Only one person.

298
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:23,140
迈克尔  是我 听着  这个电话
Michael, it's me. Listen,

299
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:25,770
昨晚上响了  我接了
this phone rang last night and I went to answer it,

300
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:27,540
但是我什么也没听到  我在想
but I couldn't hear anything  and l-

301
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:29,170
是不是你?...
I wonder if maybe it was you?

302
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:31,870
上帝啊 我现在不知道自己该做什么
Oh, god, I don't know what I should do right now.

303
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,170
我不知道是不是该留个言
I don't know if I should leave a message or

304
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,440
但我又不知道那边现在是谁在听...
who might be listening to this, but...

305
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:36,770
我...
um, I, uh...

306
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:39,040
我要知道你没事
I need to know that you're okay.

307
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:40,870
要你知道我有事
I need you to know that I'm not.

308
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,300
在吉拉我并没离开你
I didn't leave you in Gila.

309
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:44,140
有事情发生了  我...
Something happened to me and I don't...

310
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:45,640
我不知道
um, I don't know

311
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:47,100
现在该做什么也不知道该去哪儿
what to do right now. I'm not too sure where to go,

312
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:49,140
但我知道你是我唯一可以信任的人
but I know that you're the only person I can trust

313
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:53,610
我希望你...
and I need you to, um...

314
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:59,570
我希望你没事...
I need you to be okay and, um...

315
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:04,050
并且我也需要你
And I need you. Please.

316
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:13,650
准备开始边境巡逻队移交工作
Stand by to receive Border Patrol transport,

317
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:20,050
移送囚犯，待命
Incoming prisoners. Stand by.

318
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:22,650
是，长官
Yes, sir.

319
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:41,800
亚力山大 马宏  联邦调查局的
Alexander Mahone, bureau.

320
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:43,840
这些是我的囚犯我要亲自
These are my prisoners and I will be personally escorting them

321
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:46,940
在他们的车上押送他们
in their transfer vehicle.

322
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:48,040
你可以在护送车里跟着...
You can follow in the chase car...

323
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:50,100
我想你没听到我说的
I don't believe you heard me.

324
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:52,870
- 我必须要在他们的...   - 唯一允许进入
I'll be accompanying them in their...   the only people allowed in the van

325
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,270
那辆车的只有司机
are the driver

326
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,740
还有两名受训过的合格警卫
and two guards who've been trained

327
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:01,180
在囚犯运输过程中
and certified in prison transport.

328
00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:05,370
你一定要我找你上司来压你吗?
Are you really going to make me go over your head?

329
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:08,000
去找吧我甚至可以帮你打电话
I'll even dial the phone for you.

330
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:09,940
这可是标准程序
Now look, this is standard procedure,

331
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:12,000
马宏探员  我们必须
agent Mahone. We need to

332
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:13,840
让事情尽可能的在我们控制之下
keep that environment as controllable as possible.

333
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:17,170
插手的人越多就越难控制
The more bodies, the less control.

334
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:18,570
这两人
These men

335
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:19,770
可能知道
may have knowledge of

336
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:23,200
其他逃犯的位置
the location of the other escapees.

337
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:24,570
你要知道  我...
This is knowledge that I...

338
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:26,370
必须要完成我的工作
I need to do my job.

339
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:28,400
而我的工作是保证安全
And my job is to ensure the safe and

340
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:31,900
并顺利的运送这两名囚犯
successful transfer of these two prisoners.

341
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:36,710
护送车就在外面
Chase vehicles are right outside.

342
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:43,600
我们正在为您现场直播林肯・布伦斯和
We're coming to you live as brothers

343
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:46,640
迈克尔・斯科菲尔德兄弟正在被边境巡逻队
Lincoln Burrows and Michael Scofield

344
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:48,770
带出囚室...
are being led from the border patrol holding cell...

345
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:49,940
你最好有合理的解释
there better be a damn good reason

346
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:51,400
为什么这两兄弟还活者
why those brothers are still alive.

347
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:54,240
日子不好过了  比尔?
Bad day, Bill?

348
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:57,600
抱歉  我还以为是某个还存在的人打来的
Sorry, I thought this was someone who still existed.

349
00:18:57,610 --> 00:18:59,140
肉干生意怎么样  欧文?(参见第一季  凯勒曼的伪装身份)
How's the jerky business, Owen?

350
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:00,840
事实上现在这会儿很不错
Actually, it's looking pretty good right about now.

351
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:03,440
你再打一次我这个号码  你就死定了
You call this number again, you're a dead man.

352
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:06,140
其实如果你今天杀不了布伦斯和斯科菲尔德你也死定了
Actually, you don't kill Burrows and Scofield today,so are you.

353
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:08,470
你我都知道的  而你很走运
You know it and I know it, and luckily for you

354
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,750
我知道怎么救你的小命(用扬声器)
I know how to save your ass.

355
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:17,240
那两兄弟已经上路了
The brothers are already being transferred.

356
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:18,600
你太晚了
You're too late.

357
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:23,680
实际上  那运输车正是你想他们呆的地方
Actually, that transport van is exactly where you want them to be, Bill.

358
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:26,200
为什么?
Why?

359
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:28,370
为什么? 你想要我帮忙 你就得让我复职
Why? You want my help, Bill, I want my job back.

360
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:30,370
也就是说要向总统直接汇报
That means direct access to the president.

361
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:31,500
我也只需要向她汇报
I report only to her.

362
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:34,500
你在做梦  保罗  再见
You're reaching, Paul. Good-bye.

363
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:36,270
别想把我抛开  比尔
Don't shut me out, Bill.

364
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:39,570
你觉得布伦斯和斯科菲尔德对这个政府是个威胁?
You think Burrows and Scofield are a threat to this administration?

365
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:41,770
我知道卡罗琳 雷纳德做过的每一件事
I know everything Caroline Reynolds has done.

366
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:43,470
每一件事
Everything.

367
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:46,440
在你感到害怕之前  我只是想
Now, before you panic, all I'm asking

368
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:49,100
能够再去完成我的工作
is to be allowed to finish the job that I started.

369
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:51,200
向总统还有你证明
To prove to the president and to you

370
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:54,440
对这个政府来说我还是有用的
that I'm still an asset to this administration.

371
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:55,840
(计划?)

372
00:19:55,850 --> 00:20:00,070
你有什么计划?
What's your plan?

373
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,000
在伊利诺伊监狱部门我有个内应
I have an old associate in the Illinois doc.

374
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:04,000
他们负责押送
They're heading up the transfer.

375
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:05,700
这需要不只一个内部人员
It's going to take more than one guy on the inside.

376
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:09,300
如在合适的位置  一个就够了
Not if the guy's in the right place.

377
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:11,900
比尔  你给我句话
Bill, you give me the go-ahead on this

378
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:13,200
那两兄弟一走进车
when those brothers get in the van

379
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:16,750
这就是他们能做的最后一件事了
it'll be the last thing they ever do.

380
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:46,700
我以前从来没做过那个
I have never done that before.

381
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:52,660
那我想我们是弥补了一些失去的时光了
Then I guess we were making up for some lost time.

382
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,120
我必须要问问  山姆  你是否...
I have to ask, Sam, are you, uh...

383
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:58,320
是否结婚了或什么?
are you married or something?

384
00:20:58,330 --> 00:21:00,350
我?  没有
Me?  No.

385
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,750
- 是什么让你觉得...?       - 得了吧
- What makes you think...  - Come on.

386
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,250
虽然我很普通  但我也不是个傻子
I may be plain, but I'm not a fool.

387
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:05,850
通常和我在一起的男人
Usually the men I end up with are

388
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:08,120
只是在寻找一些...你知道...
just looking for something, you know...

389
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:11,850
余兴
on the side.

390
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:15,090
丹妮斯  我唯一感兴趣的
Denise, the only "side" I'm interested in,

391
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:17,520
是内在
is the inside.

392
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:19,650
而你的内在...
And that place within you...

393
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:24,130
是不普通的
is not plain.

394
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,890
我要回去上班了
I have to get back to work.

395
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,150
真的要去吗?
Do you really?

396
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:31,350
今晚是我负责关门
I have to close tonight.

397
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,320
然后我去接你如何?
How 'bout I pick you up after?

398
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:35,220
我们可以一起吃晚饭
We can have dinner.

399
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:37,490
- 你确定吗?      - 丹妮斯...
- Are you sure?  - Denise...

400
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:41,400
非常确定
I insist.

401
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:56,720
是我
Yeah

402
00:21:56,730 --> 00:21:59,520
好消息  你可以脱身了
Good news. You're off the hook.

403
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:01,820
凯勒曼有队人手准备在车队上行动
Paul Kellerman has a team ready to move on the caravan

404
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:02,990
只要一到阿拉布克
just outside of Albuquerque.

405
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,020
好的
Okay.

406
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:05,490
那我们该怎么做?
So where does that leave us?

407
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:09,720
等他们开始行动  肯定有一会儿会很混乱
When it goes down, there's sure to be a moment or two of chaos.

408
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:14,430
会有很多困惑  还有很多子弹在飞
A certain amount of confusion, lots of bullets flying.

409
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:19,760
我要你能保证保罗 凯勒曼吃到一颗
I need you there to make sure Paul Kellerman catches one.

410
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:24,350
现在就开始掩盖你的行动是不是早了点?
It's a little early to be covering your tracks, isn't it?

411
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:27,150
我们的约定只包括那些逃犯
The escapees... that was our deal.

412
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,320
就这么多
That's all.

413
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:30,050
是吗
Right.

414
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:32,920
我们的约定
Our deal.

415
00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:34,320
帮我回忆一下
Refresh my memory.

416
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:36,490
我们的约定是否应该以布伦斯和斯科菲尔德
Was our deal supposed to end with Burrows and Scofield

417
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,420
回到监狱为完结呢还是...
going back to prison or...

418
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:41,720
以他们脑袋中枪为完结呢?
bleeding from a hole in their heads?

419
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:45,450
我们在给你机会来把事情做好  阿力克斯
We're giving you a chance to make this right, Alex.

420
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:46,850
就让凯勒曼来搞定
Just let Kellerman take care of it.

421
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:48,790
让他当我们的奥斯华(注 谋杀肯尼迪的嫌犯)
Let him be our Oswald.

422
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,490
要我当你们的杰克 罗比
Then, that makes me your Jack Ruby.

423
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,850
杰克 罗比是一个人单干
Jack Ruby was working alone.

424
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:54,850
你身后可有整个美国政府
You've got the support of the United States government

425
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:56,790
当你靠山  阿力克斯
behind you, Alex.

426
00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:01,100
祝你在阿拉布克好运
Good luck in Albuquerque.

427
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:06,200
(解决掉凯勒曼)
(Retire Kellerman)

428
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:12,020
我保证  长官  这一切很快都会结束的
I promise, sir, this will all be over shortly

429
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:16,860
马上都会恢复正常的
and it will be back to business as usual.

430
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:20,120
你后悔吗?
Do you regret it?

431
00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:21,450
什么?
What?

432
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:26,350
在知道今天这种局面后   你是否后悔救我?
Knowing what you know now, do you regret helping me?

433
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:30,620
换了是你  你也会为我做相同的事
You'd have done the same thing for me.

434
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:32,350
你觉得吗?
You think?

435
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:36,090
我知道的
I know.

436
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:39,930
你没回答我的问题
You didn't answer the question.

437
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:44,490
我并不后悔我的举动
I don't regret the act.

438
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:47,800
只是对事情的发展感到遗憾
Just how it turned out.

439
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,820
我们现在是被控诉涉嫌谋杀
We've got a premeditated murder on our hands.

440
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:52,850
你想偷那笔钱
You wanted to steal money and

441
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:54,090
然后杀了唯一的证人
then kill the only witness.

442
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,490
你是我的律师还是他们的?
Are you my attorney or theirs?

443
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,920
我告诉你了我什么也没干
I told you I didn't do anything.

444
00:23:56,930 --> 00:23:59,690
我只是在跟你解释他们认为发生了什么
No, I'm just explaining their theory of what happened.

445
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:02,090
你对警察的解释是你没杀盖瑞
Your explanation to the cops that you didn't kill Geary

446
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:04,350
因为你忙着在偷
because you were too busy trying to steal

447
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,750
那属于国家的500万
five million in federally insured money.

448
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,950
这样做恐怕并不明智
Probably not the best move.

449
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,590
但还是有好消息
But there is good news.

450
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,590
是什么?
What's that?

451
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,890
地区法官愿意达成个协议
The DA is willing to offer a deal.

452
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:16,090
25年
25 years.

453
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:17,190
不要
No.

454
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,890
布拉德  他们会撤销谋杀起诉
Brad, they'll drop the capital charge.

455
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:22,120
- 就不会有死刑了    - 不要
- No death penalty. - No.

456
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:24,120
等我出来我就65岁了
I'd be almost 65 when I get out.

457
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:25,150
但你还是能出来
But you'd get out.

458
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,520
如果这案子送去审讯
If this case goes to trial,

459
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:31,290
你有很大机会会被判死刑
there's an excellent chance you're sentenced to death.

460
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:33,690
我见过很多这种情况了  布拉德
Now, I've been doing this a while, Brad,

461
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:35,790
这些事从来不会有好的结果
these things never go down good.

462
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,390
如果是整个体系都针对你
When the system wants you,

463
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:42,230
他们肯定能击败你  方法不同而已
they get you, one way or another.

464
00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:48,420
那这个约定必须要包括一点
Part of the deal's got to be

465
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:52,790
我要在伊利诺伊服刑
I do my time in Illinois,

466
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:56,330
那样我就能和我妈妈在一起了
so I can be with my mom.

467
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,550
他们要把我们带到哪儿去?
Where are they taking us?

468
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:17,120
另一个寄养的家庭
Another foster home.

469
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:19,550
我不想走  我喜欢这里
I don't want to go. I liked it there.

470
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,550
我知道你喜欢
I know you did.

471
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,950
是因为你
It's 'cause of you.

472
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:24,450
所以他们才要我们又搬  是吧?
The reason they're making us move, isn't it?

473
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:25,920
因为你又惹什么麻烦了
'Cause you were getting in trouble again.

474
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:30,100
是的  我很抱歉
Yeah, and I'm sorry.

475
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:38,920
似乎我这一辈子都是在把你拖进麻烦中
Seems like I've been dragging you into trouble my whole life.

476
00:25:38,930 --> 00:25:41,590
也把我从一些麻烦中拖出来过
Pulled me out of some, too.

477
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:45,630
是啊
Yeah

478
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,820
是我
Yerh

479
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:10,120
阿力克斯  我是保罗 凯勒曼
Alex. Paul Kellerman.

480
00:26:10,130 --> 00:26:11,920
你和比尔 金谈过了吗?
Have you spoken with Bill Kim?

481
00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:12,950
是的
Yeah,

482
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,190
是的他跟我说过了
he filled me in.

483
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:16,020
你要在阿拉布克行动
You're staging in Albuquerque.

484
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:17,020
现在听我说
Now, listen.

485
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:18,890
我现在加入
Me jumping in at this point.

486
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:20,620
并不代表
It in no way reflects

487
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:22,090
我对你做的工作有什么想法
my feelings about the job you've been doing.

488
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:24,490
我只想你明白这点
I just wanted you to know that.

489
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,850
当然
Of course.

490
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:28,490
只要我们把活儿做好
So long as we get the job done.

491
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:31,150
我们都可以回到各自的家人中去  对吧?
And we all get to go back to our families, right?

492
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:33,690
越快越好
The sooner the better.

493
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:35,190
那有什么是我要知道的吗?
So what do I need to know?

494
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,390
昨晚我们首次披露 经过九天逃亡后K
As we first reported last night, after nine days on the run...

495
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:42,820
逃犯中的林肯・布伦斯和迈克尔・斯科菲尔德
...fugitives Lincoln Burrows and Michael Scofield...

496
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:47,050
两名福克斯河8人越狱事件的主谋
...two of the masterminds behind the desperate Fox River Eight escape...

497
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:50,520
被美墨边境的巡逻队逮捕
...were apprehended by Border Patrol officials near the Mexican border...

498
00:26:50,530 --> 00:26:54,650
并将于今天被送回福克斯河州立监狱
and are being transferred back to Fox River Penitentiary today,

499
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:57,090
官方表示布伦斯的因谋杀总统的兄弟
Officials say Burrows, who was scheduled to die...

500
00:26:57,100 --> 00:27:00,590
特伦斯 斯坦德曼的死刑将会被重新安排
...for the murder of Reynolds' brother, Terrence Steadman...

501
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,990
提前到下周的某一时间
...could have his execution date rescheduled for as early as late next week,

502
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,030
因为帮助教唆其他犯人越狱
With the number of felonies the pair now face...

503
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,390
布伦斯的弟弟迈克尔斯克菲尔德 将会面临...
...Burrows' brother, Michael Scofield...

504
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
阿拉布克  新墨西哥州
Albuquerque, New Mexico

505
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:52,950
前面发生什么事了?
What's going on out there?

506
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,000
我去看看
Let me go check.

507
00:27:58,230 --> 00:28:02,060
- 看见什么了?       - 会告诉你的
- What do you see?  - I'll let you know.

508
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:06,250
移动这卡车
How much time is it going

509
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:07,450
要花多少时间?
to take to move the semi?

510
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:11,630
我的人已经做忙着解决了
I've got my men working on it now.

511
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:19,990
前面出什么事了?
What's going on up there?

512
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,300
你很着急吗  囚犯?
Are you in a hurry, convict?

513
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:28,460
我们需要帮手去把障碍排除
Hey, we need some help getting this rig out of the road.

514
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,900
林肯
Linc.

515
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,520
好吧
All right,

516
00:28:42,530 --> 00:28:43,550
我们先把手铐摘掉
let's say we get the cuffs off.

517
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:46,750
然后往哪儿跑?
Where do we go?

518
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,750
那儿
There.

519
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:51,730
这有点太简单了
That's too easy.

520
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:56,060
来吧来吧  迈克尔  快动手啊
Come on. Come on, Michael, take it.

521
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:01,930
快点 快点
Come on，Come on

522
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,330
拿钥匙
Take it.

523
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:10,530
拿上  然后跑
Take it and run.

524
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,220
让我们仔细想想
Let's think about this.

525
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:29,190
这钥匙就意外地掉下了
The keys are accidentally left out,

526
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,150
那门就这么意外地开着
the door is accidentally left open.

527
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,220
这是我们唯一的机会
It's our only shot.

528
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:33,650
这是他们唯一的机会
It's their only shot.

529
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:35,020
他们不能杀我们
They don't have an excuse to kill us

530
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:36,050
除非我们提供个理由给他们
unless we give it to them.

531
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:37,220
情况如何?
How are we doing?

532
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:38,220
目前还没动静
Nothing so far.

533
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:39,890
什么动静也没有?
None?

534
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:41,690
他们在说话  仅此而已
They're talking, that's all.

535
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:43,320
如果5分钟内他们还不上钩
If they haven't bitten in five minutes,

536
00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:44,850
你去卡车那里说问题解决了
you haul the semi, you tell them it's fixed.

537
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:46,720
然后把路恢复
You release traffic.

538
00:29:46,730 --> 00:29:48,050
然后呢?
And do what?

539
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:53,360
阿力克斯 要想兔子跳起来你就动动萝卜  
If you want the rabbit to hop, you move the carrot, Alex.

540
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:14,050
你来了
You showed.

541
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:16,350
一个绅士总是说话算话
A gentleman always does.

542
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:18,450
我们去哪儿吃呢?
Where are we going to eat?

543
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:21,350
随便哪个你内心向往的地方
Wherever your heart desires.

544
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,750
你知道我有点小事情
You know, there's just one teensy-tiny thing

545
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:26,820
想让你帮个忙
I been meaning to ask.

546
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:30,760
任何事都行
Anything.

547
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:34,990
要知道更新的地址应该是保密的
You know, forwarding addresses are supposed to be confidential.

548
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,450
我其实不该这么做的
I really shouldn't be doing this.

549
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:38,620
其实...

550
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:39,790
我们今天下午做的很多事
You shouldn't have been doing a lot of

551
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:40,890
都是你不应该做的
the things we did this afternoon,

552
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:42,790
但是

我们俩还没因此受到什么惩罚

找到了
There she is.

555
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,220
我想你的表亲
I'd imagine your cousin'll be pretty surprised

556
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:55,220
肯定会对舅舅留下的这笔钱感到意外的
to hear about the money her uncle left her.

557
00:30:55,230 --> 00:31:00,000
这点你可以肯定
You can be certain of it.

558
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:05,090
山姆  希望你不介意我问你  但...
Sam, I hope you don't mind me asking, but, um,

559
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:06,320
你的手

560
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:09,250
是出了什么事?
What happened to it?

561
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:10,750
对不起
I'm sorry.

562
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,450
我并不想让你感到不愉快
I didn't want to make you feel uncomfortable or nothing.

563
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:15,430
我只是...
I just...

564
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:17,920
想了解你
I want to know you.

565
00:31:17,930 --> 00:31:20,090
我只是想了解你的全部...
I want to know everything about you, and...

566
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:22,450
如果现在的你只是其中一部分
if this is a part of who you are,

567
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:26,830
那我想知道是怎么...
then I want to know how it...

568
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:33,760
上帝啊
oh, dear god.

569
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:37,950
(通缉)

570
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:42,960
我真希望你没看见那个
I really wish you hadn't seen that.

571
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,090
我是这么想的
Okay, here's what I'm thinking.

572
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:08,320
你和一些人
You and some of the boys

573
00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:09,750
你们想办法调到单独囚室去
get yourselves transferred over to ad seg.

574
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,190
那样的话我们就能每天
That way, we can spend our days

575
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,350
玩玩拼字游戏或者看看体育频道
playing scrabble and watching sportscenter.

576
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,890
- 听我说队长     - 然后在大概
- Look, cap'n... - then, in about

577
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:16,050
一年半左右你就推荐我去
a year and a half or so, you're gonna recommend me

578
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:17,220
做外面的劳改项目
for one of those work-release programs.

579
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:18,890
这样我就能每天
Then, I can sweat off the rest of my time

580
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:20,520
叉叉干草晒晒太阳
heaving hay and getting sun.

581
00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:22,650
-那个...     - 虽然这还不是自由  但也差不多了
- That's...  - it ain't freedom, but it's damn close.

582
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:23,690
是不是这就是你要求
Is that why you requested

583
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:24,890
被送到这里来的原因?
to be sent here?

584
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:25,990
要是我去别的地方...
I go anywhere else...

585
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,020
作为一个前任狱警  我死定了

586
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:30,390
但这里我有兄弟照顾我

给我最好的待遇...
Get me the finest accommodations...

588
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,750
他们不会把你分到单独囚室去的
they're not putting you in ad seg.

589
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:34,820
我不管他们把我分到哪里去
I don'care where they're putting me.

590
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:35,950
只要想办法把我弄到单独囚室去就好
Just take me to ad seg.

591
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,490
这里和以前不同了  队长
It's not like it used to be, cap'n.

狱警不再在这里有大权了

- What do you mean?   - This new warden.

594
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,050
他要采取严厉措施
He's cracking down.

595
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:43,150
为了证明他的决心

作为优先处理的对象

597
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:50,360
他要拿你作为示范
he's making an example out of you.

598
00:32:50,430 --> 00:32:52,750
这是怎么回事?
Lou, what the hell is this?

599

机会就要没了 迈克尔,一旦那车开走  我们就...
Window's close, Michael. Once the truck moves, we're...

604
00:35:42,730 --> 00:35:44,150

开枪打我们的许可

我们留下  一周内我就死了
We stay, I'm dead within the week,

607
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:48,490
而你要在监狱里度过余生
and you're locked up for life.

608
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:50,590
或者等他们再找到机会来干掉你
Or until they find a way to get to you.

609
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:51,950
相信我  他们会的

我们不知道莎拉在哪儿

613

莎拉也可以死了  迈克尔

就会一直跑到我这里来
