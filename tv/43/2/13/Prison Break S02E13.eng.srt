00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:03,870
We're staying.

3
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:05,910
Give 'em hell.

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:14,760
phil,don't do this.

5
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:16,700
I've dedicated my life to this country.

6
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:20,490
Every photo,every file-- get rid of it all.

7
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:21,980
Phil,don't do thiS.

8
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:24,110
You left a message for mr.Geary.

9
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,720
I'm going to gut you,bow to stern.

10
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:27,460
I did not kill roy geary.

11
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:28,780
Bagwell set me up.

12
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:31,380
You are under arrest for the first degree murder of roy william geary.

13
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:34,040
My therapist said that I need to confront you to

14
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:36,740
let you know how betrayed I feel.

15
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:39,910
this is the tribune police.

16
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:42,720
Look,as long as you do your job with me,not a chance.

17
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:46,400
And then you can go back to colorado
and visit your son and family.

18
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,200
Don't you ever mention his name again.

19
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,930
What about your friend back there?

20
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:53,360
If we're going to go down...

21
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,250
might as well go down swinging.

22
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,540
--sara.
--Michael?

23
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,240
almost made it.

24
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,320
Hello.

25
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:17,500
Hello.Michael?

26
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:20,580
Get up.

27
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,550
Turn around.

28
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:27,920
Turn around!

29
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,000
If you're going to murder us,alex

30
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,620
you're going to have to look us
in the eyes while you do it.

31
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:32,640
Shut up.

32
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:34,130
You want me,you got me.

33
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:35,350
Let my brother go!

34
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:36,620
I don't want either of you.

35
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,810
I just want my life back!

36
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:40,600
You're going to kill two innocent men to get it,huh?

37
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,200
Absolutely.

38
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:44,560
This is the united states border patrol.

39
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:47,180
Drop the weapon and remain where you are.

40
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,700
Drop your weapon.

41
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:53,650
United states border patrol.Drop your weapon.

42
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:59,300
I'm fbi.These men are in my custody.

43
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:00,460
I don't care who you are.

44
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:05,320
Until we verify,you will drop your weapon
or we will drop you.

45
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:06,990
Your choice.

46
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:27,570
Hands' on your head.Don't move.

47
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,820
You got anything to drink?

48
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:37,790
Check the back.

49
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:41,460
Unknown rider,unknown rider,this is dea on guard.

50
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:44,100
Bring up frequency 1145.

51
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:46,540
Uh-oh.

52
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,470
Uh-oh?

53
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,570
What do you mean,"uh-oh"?

54
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:51,530
Border patrol's on our ass,man.

55
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,920
How long till we get to mexico?

56
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:55,760
We're already in mexico,papa.

57
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,080
I thought they couldn't follow us
once we crossed the bord.

58
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:00,030
Hey,not since 9/11,hombre.

59
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,570
I repeat: This is dea on guard.

60
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:04,000
What are we going to do?

61
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,200
Pull the chord.

62
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:07,360
And pray.

63
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:09,050
Oh,hell,no.

64
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:12,250
Look,we try and land the plane,we're pinched for sure.

65
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:14,010
And if we jump?

66
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:16,050
We're in the middle of the desert.

67
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:19,660
Patrol have a hard time trying to find us once we land.

68
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:21,270
If we land.

69
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,770
Oh,you're going to land.

70
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,920
It's just a matter of how hard.

71
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,500
Good luck,amigo.

72
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:47,880
We're receiving reports that escaped convicts lincoln burrows

73
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,350
and michael scofield have been apprehended

74
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:52,730
just a few miles north of the us-mexican border.

75
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:56,140
Federal agent alex mahone with assistance from the united states

76
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:59,900
border patrol took the men into custody
just a short time ago.

77
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:02,070
Now,not a lot of information available at this time

78
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:04,100
but we do know the brothers were apprehended

79
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:06,380
without incident while attempting to leave the country

80
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:08,950
through the deserts of new mexico quite a long way

81
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:10,920
from illinois's fox river state penitentiary

82
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:13,460
where they escaped from less than ten days ago.

83
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:16,620
The fox river eight,as the group of
convicts were once known

84
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:20,480
are now down to four,as only benjamin miles franklin

85
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,500
fernando sucre,charles patoshik and
theodore bagwell remain at large.

86
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:30,300
Sir.He just heard.And he'd like to see you.

00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:10,290
'Scuse me,sarge.

92
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:14,070
I,uh,was wondering if you could,uh,help a brother out.

93
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:15,590
With what?

94
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,230
I only recently returned from delivering democracy

95
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:24,050
to the desert and,uh,I was wondering
if you could tell me

96
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:27,200
how a guy goes about getting a hold of one of those prosthetic jobbies.

97
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,460
What,they make you whole before they shipped you back?

98
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:32,680
Well,let's just say the doctor made the bed.

99
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:35,270
He just neglected to tuck in the sheets.

100
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:38,380
Best thing for you to do is go on down there to va.

101
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:40,000
Get in line.

102
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:42,260
That simple?

103
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:43,810
Yeah.

104
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,120
Till they send you the bill and you
got to figure out how to pay.

105
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,310
Those bastards up there in washington send us off

106
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:51,670
to fight for them; not a damn one of 'em fights for us.

107
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:53,840
And that is a crime.

108
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:57,240
But luckily for me,uh...

109
00:05:57,330 --> 00:05:59,750
money is not the issue.

110
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:01,260
Is that right?

111
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:05,620
Any particular,uh,forms i might need in order to qualify?

112
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,910
You know what,mr.Don't ask,don't tell?

113
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:11,830
You figured out how to dye that hair of yours up like

114
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:14,860
like a nancy all by yourself,you sure as hell can figure out

115
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:18,650
how to get a prosthetic for that
stump of yours by yourself.

116
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:27,500
Yeah,I think I got a pretty good idea where to start.

JOLIET ILLINOIS
FOX RIVER STATE PENITENTIARY

119
00:06:42,645 --> 00:06:46,030
I'm here with ed pavelka,the new warden
of fox river penitentiary

120
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:48,760
where lincoln burrows and michael scofield are scheduled to

121
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:50,700
be returned to sometime tomorrow.

122
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:53,010
Now,warden,the escape happened a mere two days

123
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:55,460
before burrows was scheduled to be put to death.

124
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:58,760
He's already been granted one day;
do you anticipate any further?

125
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:01,830
Lincoln burrows is a convicted murderer.

126
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:06,010
His escape has endangered the lives of civilians across this country.

127
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,440
He is not a celebrity.
He is not a martyr.

128
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:13,220
I can assure you that whatever leniency was afforded him

129
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:17,850
and the her prisoners under the old regime at fox river
will no longer be tolerated.

130
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:21,050
The only thing that mr.Burrows can expect is

131
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,670
what a jury of his peers demanded: A speedy execution.

132
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:26,020
And michael scofield?

133
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:32,370
With his escape,the aiding and abetting charges
the felonies he's racked up along the way

134
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:36,290
on top of his original sentence
I'd say mr.Scofield will be spending

135
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:39,950
the rest of his life behind bars.Thank you.

136
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:51,390

Congratulations,sir.

142
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:22,780
What do you got?

143
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:25,090
A call from the illinois doc.

144
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:27,340
They're sending a huge contingent down
there to collect burrows

145
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,640
and scofield,take them back to fox river personally.

146
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:32,420
Remind them this is a federal case and
we'll handle the transport.Now...

147
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:35,940
I did.But it's an election year,collar this big
everybody wants a piece.

148
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:39,830
The warden called in a favor to the bureau chief;
he okayed it,so here we are.

149
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:41,930
Should be there in about an hour.

150
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:44,880
I want to be placed in the prisoner transport vehicle.

151
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:46,130
What for?

152
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:47,620
Just get it done.

153
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:50,350
Sir,these were the big fish.

154
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,860
And you brought 'em in.

155
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:54,150
You should feel good about that.

156
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,530
Yeah...

157
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:59,050
yeah.

158
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,760
Well,at least we're together.

159
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:04,080
Yes,there is that.

160
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,980
What are you thinking?

161
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:11,130
I'm thinking about the old man.

162
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:15,370
What he tried to do,you know.

163
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:20,620
Tough to go down swinging when you're locked in a box.

164
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,330
This isn't over yet.

165
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,760
We're entitled to a phone call.

166
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:28,540
We make that one call to sara and
she has the information dad said she has

167
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,200
we can get you exonerated before
this whole thing goes down.

168
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:32,170
No.

169
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,410
Hey.

170
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:37,540
We're entitled to a phone call.

171
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:41,910
You're entitled to precisely squat
until you're officially in custody.

172
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:44,620
And that won't happen until you're back in fox river.

173
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,560
So sit tight.

174
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:53,000
It's not over yeT.

175
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:54,530
Not yet.

176
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:58,970
A lot of ground to cover between here and illinois.

177
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:04,320
I mean,what are the chances we even
make it back to fox river alive?

178
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:10,530
Saw you on the news,alex.

179
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:11,540
Did you?

180
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:12,980
The brothers too.

181
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:15,080
They were a little more,um...

182
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:17,880
breathing than I had hoped.

183
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:20,370
Yeah,well,border patrol showed up.
Nothing I could do.

184
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:21,820
Really?

185
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,680
Burrows and scofield,can you see them from where you are?

186
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,050
Yeah.

187
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:29,360
Then put a bullet in their heads.

188
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,070
They're being watched.

189
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:33,660
I don't care.

190
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:34,820
By armed guards.

191
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:37,020
They make it back to fox river,it is over.

192
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,480
For all of us.

193
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,410
There's not much more this country loves
than a bad man with a good story.

194
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:45,780
How much longer do you think it'll be before
someone puts a microphone in front of them?

195
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:47,220
Hey,are you listening?

196
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:50,950
Okay,with the security here,what you're asking me
to do is tantamount to suicide.

197
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:52,300
Do you understand what I'm saying?

198
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:54,280
I wasn't asking anything.

199
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:57,040
That would imply you had a say in the matter.

200
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:02,280
Pull this off and you're halfway home,alex.

201
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:05,980
You remember what home is like.Don't you?

202
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:09,520
900 west end avenuE.White fence.Red door.

203
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:12,260
Stay away from my family!

204
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,720
you got a little something on your,uh...

205
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,930
no,I...

206
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:15,390
here,let me.

207
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,840
Pardon my forwardness,I was...

208
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,280
it's okay.Thank you.

209
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,710
Normally I wouldn't intervene,it's just...

210
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:28,850
yesterday when I got home from work
I found what looked like

211
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:32,730
the brazilian rain forest lodged between my two front teeth.

212
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:37,600
And all I could think about was the number of
people who must've seen and not...

213
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:40,650
not a damn one of them had the decency to tell me.

214
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:44,460
Mild diastema.

215
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,170
Excuse me?

216
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:50,260
It's a slight gap between your eight and nine.

217
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,960
Your two front teeth.

218
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:56,530
And that it sometimes can act as a magnet for food like...

219
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:01,030
broccoli and tuna and sometimes rice.

220
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,440
Or relish.

221
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,970
All this and brains,too?

222
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:06,740
What are you,a dentist or...

223
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:08,800
Me?No,hardly,no.

224
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,200
I could never.

225
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:12,190
My ex,my ex-husband,he was...

226
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:13,850
a bastard?

227
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:16,600
That too.

228
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:27,850
Have you ever been to italy,uh...

229
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:29,550
Denise.

230
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:32,090
Denise,that's a lovely name.

231
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:40,700
you know,in italy,they have wine every day with lunch.

232
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:42,720
And what do we do in this country?

233
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:47,320
We power our food down with caffeine,carbonation
and high fructose corn syrup.

234
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:52,120
No one ever takes the time to enjoy things anymore.

235
00:13:54,530 --> 00:14:04,440
Denise,would you do me the honor of "enjoying"
the rest of your lunch with me?

236
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:09,350
I think I'd like that.

237
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:13,100
White or red?

238
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,160
And with limited financial resources
he poses no flight risk...

239
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:22,960
unless he'd rather not stand trial for capital murder.

240
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:26,300
The defendant has shown great resourcefulness in

241
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:29,860
being able to travel across country with little money.

242
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:32,470
There's no reason he couldn't do it again.

243
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:37,110
If you don't want to believe me,believe mr.Bellick.

244
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:41,110
You thieving son of a bitch.

245
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,730
You better get down on your knees and pray to god that

246
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:48,310
I never find you because if I do,mark my words:
I will gut you bow to stern.

247
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:56,490
he promised to kill mr.Geary
and then he kept that promisE.

248
00:14:56,540 --> 00:15:01,940
A man like the defendant should not be out in society.

249
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:04,590
I concur.

250
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:06,750
Bail denied.

251
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,260
who would that be?

252
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,800
Only one person.

253
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Michael,it's me.Listen,this phone rang last night and

254
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:24,610
I went to answer it,but I couldn't hear anything
and I-I nder if maybe it was you?

255
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,550
oh,god,I don't know what I should do right now.

256
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:29,950
I don't know if i should leave a message or
who might be listening to this,but...

257
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:34,020
um,I,uh...I need to know that you're okay.

258
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:36,530
I need you to know that I'm not.

259
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:39,140
I didn't leave you in gila.
Something happened to me and I don'T...

260
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:42,000
um,I don't know what to do right now.

261
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,000
I'm not too sure where to go,but I know that
you're the only person

262
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:47,460
I can trust and I need you to,um...

263
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,250
I need you to be okay and,um...

264
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:56,520
and I need you.

265
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:58,370
Please.

266
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:36,020
Alexander mahone,bureau.

267
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:40,440
These are my prisoners and I will be personally escorting them

268
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,880
in their transfer vehicle.

269
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:43,210
You can follow in the chase car...

270
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:45,330
I don't believe you heard me.

271
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:47,420
I'll be accompanying them in their...

272
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,550
the only people allowed in the van are the driver

273
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:55,480
and two guards who've been trained
and certified in prison transport.

274
00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:00,830
Are you really going to make me go over your head?

275
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:03,830
I'll even dial the phone for you.

276
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:06,770
Now look,this is standard procedure,agent mahone.

277
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:09,520
We need to keep that environment as controllable as possible.

278
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:12,560
The more bodies,the less control.

279
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:17,730
These men may have knowledge of the location of the other escapees.

280
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:20,130
this is knowledge that I...

281
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:22,240
I need to do my job.

282
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:26,980
And my job is to ensure the safe and
successful transfer of these two prisoners.

283
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:30,360
Chase vehicles are right outside.

284
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:42,850
We're coming to you live as brothers
lincoln burrows and michael scofield

285
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:44,420
are being led from the border patrol holding cell...

286
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:46,980
there better be a damn good reason
why those brothers are still alive.

287
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:48,770
Bad day,bill?

288
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:52,650
Sorry,I thought this was someone who still existed.

289
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:54,630
How's the jerky business,owen?

290
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:56,560
Actually,it's looking pretty good right about now.

291
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,900
You call this number again,you're a dead man.

292
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:01,570
Actually,you don't kill burrows and scofield today
so are you.

293
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:05,910
You know it and I know it,and luckily for you
I know how to save your ass.

294
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:12,230
The brothers are already being transferred.

295
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:14,100
You're too late.

296
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:17,590
Actually,that transport van is exactly
where you want them to be,bill.

297
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:20,400
Why?

298
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:21,910
Why?

299
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:23,730
You want my help,bill,I want my job back.

300
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,780
That means direct access to the president.

301
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:27,520
I report only to her.

302
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,060
You're reaching,paul.

303
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:30,030
Good-bye.

304
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:31,390
Don't shut me out,bill.

305
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:34,080
You think burrows and scofield are a threat to this administration?

306
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:37,030
I know everything caroline reynolds has done.

307
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:38,850
Everything.

308
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:41,580
Now,before you panic,all I'm asking

309
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:44,680
is to be allowed to finish the job that I started.

310
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:46,900
To prove to the president and to you

311
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,160
that I'm still an asset to this administration.

312
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:53,600
What's your plan?

313
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:58,130
I have an old associate in the illinois doc.

314
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,570
They're heading up the transfer.

315
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:01,720
It's going to take more than one guy on the inside.

316
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:04,520
Not if the guy's in the right place.

317
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:06,880
Bill,you give me the go-ahead on this

318
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:08,710
when those brothers get in the van

319
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:11,100
it'll be the last thing they ever do.

320
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:38,419
I have never done that before.

321
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:44,489
Then I guess we were making
up for some lost time.

322
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:49,789
I have to ask,sam,are you,uh...

323
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:53,399
- are you married or something?
- Me? No.

324
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:55,079
- What makes you think...
- Come on.

325
00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:57,039
I may be plain,but I'm not a fool.

326
00:20:57,070 --> 00:21:00,729
Usually the men I end up with are
just looking for something,you know...

327
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,419
on the side.

328
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:08,289
Denise,the only "side" I'm interested in,

329
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:12,939
is the inside.and that place within you...

330
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:16,349
is not plain.

331
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,589
I have to get back to work.

332
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,919
Do you really?

333
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,299
I have to close tonight.

334
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:25,909
How 'bout I pick you up after?

335
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:27,929
We can have dinner.

336
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,809
- Are you sure?
- Denise...

337
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:33,449
I insist.

338
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:50,369
Good news.

339
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,359
You're off the hook.

340
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:55,839
Paul kellerman has a team ready to move
on the caravan just outside of albuquerque.

341
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,319
Okay.

342
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:58,579
So where does that leave us?

343
00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:01,949
When it goes down,there's sure
to be a moment or two of chaos.

344
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:06,099
A certain amount of
confusion,lots of bullets flying.

345
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:10,819
I need you there to make sure
paul kellerman catches one.

346
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:16,619
It's a little early to be
covering your tracks,isn't it?

347
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:19,709
The escapees--
that was our deal.

348
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:20,889
That's all.

349
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:22,449
Right.

350
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:24,839
Our deal.

351
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:30,899
Refresh my memory.Was our deal supposed to end
with burrows and scofield going back to prison or...

352
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:33,909
bleeding from a hole in their heads?

353
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:37,619
We're giving you a chance
to make this right,alex.

354
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:39,219
Just let kellerman take care of it.

355
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:41,099
Let him be our oswald.

356
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:42,889
Then,that makes me your jack ruby.

357
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,899
Jack ruby was working alone.

358
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:49,199
You've got the support of the united
states government behind you,alex.

359
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:51,919
Good luck in albuquerque.

360
00:22:55,116 --> 00:22:56,892
(Retire Kellerman)

361
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:04,219
I promise,sir,this will all be over shortly

362
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:07,079
and it will be back to business as usual.

363
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:12,999
Do you regret it?

364
00:23:13,050 --> 00:23:14,679
What?

365
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:19,539
Knowing what you know
now,do you regret helping me?

366
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:22,539
You'd have done the same thing for me.

367
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:24,979
You think?

368
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:27,449
I know.

369
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:31,109
You didn't answer the question.

370
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:35,779
I don't regret the act.

371
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:39,669
Just how it turned out.

372
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:44,149
We've got a premeditated
murder on our hands.

373
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:46,619
You wanted to steal money and
then kill the only witness.

374
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:49,189
Are you my attorney or theirs?
I told you I didn't do anything.

375
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:51,889
No,I'm just explaining their
theory of what happened.

376
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:54,389
Your explanation to the cops
that you didn't kill geary

377
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:58,609
because you were too busy trying to steal
five million in federally insured money.

378
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:01,159
Probably not the best move.

379
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:03,159
But there is good news.

380
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:04,369
What's that?

381
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:06,629
The da is willing to offer a deal.

382
00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:08,339
25 years.

383
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:09,629
No.

384
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:11,749
Brad,they'll drop the capital charge.

385
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:13,019
No death penalty.

386
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:14,579
No.

387
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,269
I'd be almost 65 when I get out.

388
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,099
But you'd get out.

389
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:23,239
If this case goes to trial,there's an
excellent chance you're sentenced to death.

390
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:25,819
Now,I've been doing this a
while,brad,and I can tell you

391
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:28,909
these things never go down good.

392
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:34,039
When the system wants you,they
get you,one way or another.

393
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:44,619
Part of the deal's got to
be I do my time in illinois,

394
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:47,359
so i can be with my mom.

395
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,939
Where are they taking us?

396
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:09,409
Another foster home.

397
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,799
I don't want to go.I liked it there.

398
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,359
I know you did.

399
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:14,499
It's 'cause of you.

400
00:25:14,530 --> 00:25:16,909
The reason they're making us move,isn't it?

401
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,109
'Cause you were getting in trouble again.

402
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:22,049
Yeah,and I'm sorry.

403
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:31,019
Seems like I've been dragging
you into trouble my whole life.

404
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:33,849
Pulled me out of some,too.

405
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,649
Alex.Paul kellerman.

406
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:04,399
Have you spoken with bill kim?

407
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:08,599
Yeah,he filled me in.You're
staging in albuquerque.

408
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,059
Now,listen.

409
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:14,169
Me jumping in at this point.It in no way reflects
my feelings about the job you've been doing.

410
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:16,319
I just wanted you to know that.

411
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:19,199
Of course.

412
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:21,219
So long as we get the job done.

413
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:23,929
And we all get to go back
to our families,right?

414
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:25,899
The sooner the better.

415
00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:28,529
So what do I need to know?

416
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:03,649
Albuquerque,new mexico

417
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:45,509
What's going on out there?

418
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:47,229
Let me go check.

419
00:27:50,630 --> 00:27:53,399
what do you see?I'll let you know.

420
00:27:57,790 --> 00:27:59,579
How much time is it going
to take to move the semi?

421
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:02,039
I've got my men working on it now.

422
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:12,619
What's going on up there?

423
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:14,619
Are you in a hurry,convict?

424
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:19,669
Hey,we need some help getting
this rig out of the road.

425
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:27,019
Linc.

426
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:38,599
All right,let's say we get
the cuffs off.Where do we go?

427
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,989
There.

428
00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:43,199
That's too easy.

429
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:47,519
Come on.Come on,michael,take it.

430
00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:52,249
Come on,come on.

431
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:57,389
Take it.

432
00:28:59,670 --> 00:29:02,819
Take it and run.

433
00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:17,319
let's think about this.

434
00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:21,519
The keys are accidentally left
out,the door is accidentally left open.

435
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:23,839
- It's our only shot.
- It's their only shot.

436
00:29:23,870 --> 00:29:26,389
They don't have an excuse to
kill us unless we give it to them.

437
00:29:26,410 --> 00:29:27,629
How are we doing?

438
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,879
Mahone: Nothing so far.

439
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:30,289
None?

440
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:32,119
They're talking,that's all.

441
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:35,669
If they haven't bitten in five minutes,you
haul the semi,you tell them it's fixed.

442
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:36,939
You release traffic.

443
00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:38,049
And do what?

444
00:29:38,090 --> 00:29:41,689
If you want the rabbit to
hop,you move the carrot,alex.

445
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,629
You showed.

446
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,099
A gentleman always does.

447
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:07,779
Where are we going to eat?

448
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:09,809
Wherever your heart desires.

449
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:14,999
You know,there's just one teensy-tiny
thing I been meaning to ask.

450
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:18,339
Anything.

451
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:24,289
You know,forwarding addresses
are supposed to be confidential.

452
00:30:24,330 --> 00:30:26,799
I really shouldn't be doing this.

453
00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:31,859
you shouldn't have been doing a lot of
the things we did this afternoon,but,uh,

454
00:30:31,890 --> 00:30:35,739
neither of us has been smited down yet.

455
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:38,929
There she is.

456
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:44,339
I'd imagine your cousin'll be pretty surprised
to hear about the money her uncle left her.

457
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:46,769
You can be certain of it.

458
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:54,189
Sam,I hope you don't mind me asking,but,um,

459
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:56,289
your hand.

460
00:30:56,330 --> 00:30:58,789
What happened to it?

461
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:04,729
I'm sorry.I didn't want to make you
feel uncomfortable or nothing.I just...

462
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:07,009
I want to know you.

463
00:31:07,050 --> 00:31:10,179
I want to know everything about you,and...

464
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:19,019
if this is a part of who you
are,then I want to know how it--

465
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:21,769
oh,dear god.

466
00:31:27,730 --> 00:31:32,109
I really wish you hadn't seen that.

467
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:55,909
Okay,here's what I'm thinking.

468
00:31:55,950 --> 00:31:58,849
You and some of the boys get
yourselves transferred over to ad seg.

469
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,479
That way,we can spend our days playing
scrabble and watching sportscenter.

470
00:32:01,530 --> 00:32:02,539
Look,cap'N...

471
00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:06,299
then,in about a year and a half or so,you're gonna
recommend me for one of those work-release programs.

472
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:09,579
Then,I can sweat off the rest of
my time heaving hay and getting sun.

473
00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:11,979
- That's...
- it ain't freedom,but it's damn close.

474
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:13,939
Is that why you requested to be sent here?

475
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:17,579
I go anywhere else-- as
a former co,I'm dead man.

476
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:19,469
But here I got men to watch my back.

477
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:22,699
- Get me the finest accommodations...
- they're not putting you in ad seg.

478
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:24,719
I don'care where they're putting
me.Just take me to ad seg.

479
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:26,549
It's not like it used to be,cap'N.

480
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,449
The cos don't run the game here anymore.

481
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,969
- What do you mean?
- This new warden.

482
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,519
He's cracking down.

483
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:35,269
And to prove he's serious about
showing preferential treatment,

484
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:38,169
he's making an example out of you.

485
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,519
Lou,what the hell is this?

486
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,839
General pop.

487
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:03,339
Welcome home,

488
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:05,989
boss.

489
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:38,759
sonoran desert,mexico 40miles
south of the us/mexico border

490
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:16,889
okay,everybody,we're moving out.

491
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:30,919
Window's closi,michael.Once
the truck moves,we're...

492
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:33,949
if we run now,we give them permission
to put a bullet in our heads.

493
00:35:33,970 --> 00:35:37,139
We stay,I'm dead within the
week,and you're locked up for life.

494
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:39,299
Or until they find a way to get to you.

495
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:40,409
And,believe me,they will.

496
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:42,979
If we go back to prison,we'll
have a few extra days.

497
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:44,509
We'll have a chance to contact sara.

498
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:45,969
We don't know where sara is.

499
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:48,419
Sara may be dead,michael.

500
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:52,849
Let me get us out of here
the only way I know how.

501
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:54,829
Fighting?

502
00:36:00,530 --> 00:36:02,679
Get the keys.

503
00:36:07,910 --> 00:36:09,639
Here we go.Here we go.

504
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:11,629
Copyhat.

505
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,719
All right,we're on.Heads up.

506
00:36:14,770 --> 00:36:17,379
Hold traffic.

507
00:36:29,810 --> 00:36:32,829
You know we have no idea
what's behind that door.

508
00:36:33,610 --> 00:36:35,649
Nope.

509
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,119
You ready?

510
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,389
No.You?

511
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:41,789
No.

512
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:44,729
Let's go.

513
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:29,659
Just pray there's another way out of here.

514
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:51,089
xxx

515
00:38:25,650 --> 00:38:27,199
Hey,they're in.

516
00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:28,509
And they're heading straight for you.

517
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,569
Armed?

518
00:38:29,570 --> 00:38:31,869
No.Where are you?I'll back you up.

519
00:38:31,890 --> 00:38:35,179
Just keep moving.As long as they're
running from you,they're running toward me.

520
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:37,249
They're boxed in.

521
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:42,279
ness city,kansas

522
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:09,229
Hold on one sec.

523
00:39:10,330 --> 00:39:12,649
Can I write a check for the
food?'Cause I don't have...

524
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:15,219
hello,mrs.Hollander.

525
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:18,089
They say a good woman is hard to find.

526
00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:23,379
Well,if that's true,you must be very,very...

527
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:25,209
very good.

528
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:27,429
Don't be frightened.

529
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:30,589
Teddy's home.

530
00:40:17,970 --> 00:40:20,969
They're improvising,heading
toward the surface.

531
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:33,779
Where to?

532
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:34,919
I don't know.

533
00:40:34,970 --> 00:40:36,809
Look,if something happens to us

534
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:40,709
if we get separated or one of us doesn't
make it,promise me you'll find sara.

535
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:42,889
We're gonna make it.Just promise me.

536
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:44,789
I promisE.Come on.

537
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,079
President reynolds ruined your life.

538
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:19,249
She ruined my life.

539
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:21,209
You want to take that bitch down?

540
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:25,159
You just found your inside
man,but it's got to be right now.

541
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:26,879
Let's go.

542
00:42:26,910 --> 00:42:29,169
Now!

543
00:42:30,690 --> 00:42:34,519


544
00:42:34,910 --> 00:42:37,129
