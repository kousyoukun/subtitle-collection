1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:02,030
 <i>Previously on</i> Prison Break:

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:03,960
A very credible witness
has just come forward,

3
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:05,160
and he's willing to testify.

4
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:06,330
He'll corroborate
everything

5
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:07,500
you've said about
this conspiracy.

6
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:08,560
Who?

7
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:14,360
How much do you know
about Sona, Mr. Kim?

8
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:16,060
Only what I've been
given clearance on.

9
00:00:16,130 --> 00:00:18,330
There's been a, uh,
change in strategy.

10
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,560
How much further
would I have to go?

11
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:21,730
For this, you only
have to go to Panama.

12
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,200
I didn't know you were
gonna be here, Michael.

13
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:24,660
You e-mailed me.
You said T-Bag was here.

14
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:25,760
It's on the Web site.

15
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:27,100
I didn't write anything
on no Web site.

16
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,500
This is looking more
and more like a setup.

17
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,660
He's got Maricruz
locked away somewhere.

18
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:32,160
You're gonna help him
get the money

19
00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:33,160
or she's dead.

20
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:35,100
Freeze, Bagwell!

21
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,530
(gunshots)
(yells in pain)

22
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,900
Theodore Bagwell--
he's the one you want

23
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,660
for that dead chick in there.

24
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:42,430
MICHAEL:
Sucre, you'd better
pull it together.

25
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:43,860
(Sucre yelling)

26
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:47,100
Go get the money, please.

27
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:49,930
Who are you fooling?

28
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,060
You ain't going to kill me,
Mr. Michelangelo.

29
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:54,900
You ain't got it in you.

30
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,100
(screaming)

31
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,130
Linc?

32
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,860
Hello, Michael.
What do you want, Alex?

33
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:03,860
Bring me the money,
bring me the boat.

34
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:05,560
You are out of your mind.

35
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:07,530
We both have something
the other person needs.

36
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,400
Your brother for your plan. 

37
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:11,760
Five minutes.
That's all you have.

38
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:20,900
(sighs)

39
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:23,930
LINCOLN:
 <i>I didn't kill that man,</i>
 <i>Michael.</i>

40
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,960
MICHAEL:
 <i>I'm getting you out of here.</i>

41
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:28,630
LINCOLN:
 <i>I've got three weeks.</i>

42
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,730
MICHAEL:
 <i>Just have a little faith.</i>

43
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:34,600
 <i>I did everything I could.</i>

44
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:36,130
I know you did.

45
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:52,400
BOY:
Señor?

46
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:53,560
 <i>Chicle?</i>

47
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:55,330
No.

48
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,330
Soda?

49
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,230
Beer, my friend?

50
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:02,100
Spleef? Magic mushrooms?

51
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,100
Burst your brains,
split it wide open.

52
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:07,030
I'm your man, man.

53
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:09,160
Magic Mystery Tour
right here in this box.

54
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:12,160
And if I don't got it,
I can get it.

55
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:13,500
(phone vibrating)

56
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,860
Beat it.

57
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:22,860
MAHONE:
So you gonna do the right thing?

58
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:24,960
Right for who, Alex?

59
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:26,500
MAHONE:
You lost, Michael.

60
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,830
That's what you've done here.

61
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,330
And you're gonna lose
a whole lot more,

62
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,830
unless you tell me right here
and right now

63
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,530
you're gonna
bring me the money,

64
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,160
you're gonna bring me the boat.

65
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:37,900
And you'll just let
my brother go?

66
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,530
Yeah.

67
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,000
Just like you let Tweener go.

68
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:44,830
and Abruzzi...

69
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:46,230
and Haywire.

70
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,300
Things are different now.

71
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,300
Really?

72
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,500
Yeah. The people
I was working for,

73
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:55,730
they kind of, uh...
sold me down the river.

74
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,130
Now I just want
to go out to sea.

75
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,730
Well, that's funny--
I'll have to remember that one.

76
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,730
I face more prison time
than you.

77
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,060
I sort of jumped ahead

78
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:06,560
of you a few spots
on the public enemy list.

79
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:09,500
You're my way to freedom,
Michael, and I'm yours.

80
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:12,260
We both know what the other
one's capable of. Come on.

81
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:14,130
Let's treat each other
with a little respect here.

82
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,430
No games. No nothing.

83
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,060
Just two guys
doing each other a favor.

84
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:20,260
What do you say?

85
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,230
Where are you?

86
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:27,400
Miraflores shipping docks,
just outside of Panama City.

87
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:30,160
It's a big warehouse
right on the water.

88
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:31,900
That's a long ways.

89
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,100
It'll take me at least 24 hours
to get there.

90
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,800
Well, then, I'd get moving.

91
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:42,500
How's it feel
being on the run?

92
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,660
I'll survive.

93
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:46,130
Not if they catch you.

94
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,100
They'll send you to the chair.

95
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:51,530
You think that's ironic?

96
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,230
Think it'd be justice.

97
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,260
Mr. Kim, Alex Mahone.

98
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,260
Call me.

99
00:03:58,330 --> 00:03:59,760
Oh...

100
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:01,630
justice will be served.

101
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,730
KELLERMAN:
 <i>What I'm about</i>
 <i>to divulge to you</i>

102
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,960
will in all likelihood
get me killed.

103
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:10,900
Actually, I guarantee it.

104
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,430
Then why are you doing it?

105
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,800
Because this was supposed
to be about country,

106
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:17,660
about loyalty,

107
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:20,230
about what's right,
but it wasn't

108
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:21,300
because...

109
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,300
I wronged people

110
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,160
who should not have
been wronged.

111
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:33,200
Those orders were given
by Caroline Reynolds,

112
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:35,730
who was Vice President
at the time.

113
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:39,660
Acting on those orders,
I planted evidence...

114
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:41,000
I procured a body,

115
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:43,060
I lured Lincoln Burroughs

116
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:45,660
into that parking garage
that evening

117
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:47,730
under the auspices
of a different hit.

118
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:53,800
From the ground up,
we framed him.

119
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,300
Perfect.

120
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,060
So, Lincoln Burroughs
gets executed,

121
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:01,460
people forget
about Terrence Steadman,

122
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:04,600
the controversy surrounded him
and the presidency.

123
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:07,930
And nobody ever knows about...
The Company.

124
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,300
Ah, yes, which is a shadowy
cabal of corporations

125
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,030
that pretty much influence

126
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,030
everything that happens
in this country.

127
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:17,530
But I fail to see how any
of this is relevant

128
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,230
to Sara Tancredi and the fact
that she aided and abetted,

129
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,360
that she jumped bail...

130
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:23,860
She did so because she
feared for her life,

131
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:25,660
which was appropriate,

132
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:27,800
'cause I had orders to kill her.

133
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:41,800
(sighs)

134
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:44,000
(seagulls crying)

135
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:49,630
(waves lapping)

136
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:51,660
Hey!

137
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,660
Are you still
in the magic business?

138
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:00,130
 <i>Siempre.</i>

139
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,460
What's your name?

140
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:03,430
Chaco.

141
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:06,500
JUDGE:
 <i>It's all here.</i>

142
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,830
Everything Mr. Kellerman said

143
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,400
is corroborated
in these documents.

144
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:11,400
In light of this evidence,

145
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:14,160
my question, I guess, to you
is whether your time

146
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:16,760
and resources are best spent
in pursuing charges

147
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:18,330
against Dr. Tancredi.

148
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,860
No. My office will drop

149
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:23,930
all charges,
effective immediately.

150
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,360
(bangs gavel)

151
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:26,600
But, Your Honor,
I would like

152
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:27,860
to devote my time
and attention

153
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:31,460
in prosecuting this man,
Mr. Kellerman.

154
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:33,630
JUDGE:
Officer.

155
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:43,300
I-I literally don't even know
what to say to you.

156
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,730
It was good knowing you, Sara.

157
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:53,130
(cell phone ringing)

158
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,530
Yeah?

159
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,860
Where are we?

160
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:58,630
MAHONE:
I'm in Panama. Nice place.

161
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:01,460
Good weather. Cool breeze.

162
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:03,500
Where are we with the brothers?

163
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,430
When you get them
where they need to be,

164
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,500
I want to come down there
for visual confirmation.

165
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,100
Then I suggest
you get on a plane,

166
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,830
because by the time
you get here,

167
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:13,500
I will have Scofield and
Burroughs where you want them.

168
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,630
 <i>And then this</i>
 <i>whole thing is over.</i>

169
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:19,700
(cell phone snaps shut)

170
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:30,000
MICHAEL:
Sara, it's me.

171
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:32,300
It's a strange thing...

172
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,630
leaving a message

173
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,830
for someone you know
is never gonna get it.

174
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:40,760
I can only assume
the worst, so...

175
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:46,730
this will be the last message
I leave for you.

176
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,960
I just wanted you to know
that I made it.

177
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:53,660
But it's no good without you.

178
00:07:57,730 --> 00:07:59,960
Anyway, you remember when I...

179
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:02,030
remember when I told you
about those...

180
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:06,160
50-cent beers
in Baja at happy hour?

181
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:09,160
They're even cheaper down here.

182
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:13,530
If by some miracle,
you do get this...

183
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,230
I need you to listen close.

184
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:21,060
Sara...

185
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:23,600
Sara, I suggest
we get you out of here.

186
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:25,400
It's going to be
a media circus outside.

187
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:27,360
It'll only get bigger.
Let's go.

188
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:29,130
Sure.

189
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:32,330
TV REPORTER:
 <i>Larger, unexpected fireworks</i>
 <i>at the trial</i>

190
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:35,030
of Dr. Sara Tancredi
in Chicago today.

191
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:37,030
New testimony has implicated

192
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,900
that former President Reynolds
was complicit

193
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,260
in the falsification of...

194
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:42,960
Good afternoon.
We are coming to you live

195
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:44,530
from Chicago
County Courthouse

196
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,400
where a bomb has been
dropped this morning.

197
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:48,060
Purported killer
Lincoln Burroughs

198
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:51,100
who has fled the country
on a nationwide manhunt

199
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,860
will be exonerated
of all charges

200
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:54,730
effective immediately.

201
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,400
(camera shutters clicking)

202
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:58,730
Oh, my God, Bruce,
Lincoln's a free man.

203
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,360
Michael left me a message.

204
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:38,500
Okay... my God.

205
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,930
He doesn't know.
He's still planning on running.

206
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,630
Uh... Come on, Michael,
come on, come on.

207
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:50,600
(phone buzzing)

208
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:52,100
Let me do
the introduction.

209
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,360
All right, but I'll
do the talking.

210
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:55,900
 <i>Si.</i>

211
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,160
Okay, I got
to go to him.

212
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:04,530
What that, about
3,000 miles, Sara?

213
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,600
It is. So we're going to
have to swing by my hotel

214
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,530
and you're going to have
to get me to the airport,

215
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,600
because, Bruce, he's got to know
he doesn't have to run anymore.

216
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:12,500
What he's doing right now
is going to get him killed.

217
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:19,660
KIM:
The stars are finally
aligning, sir.

218
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:21,460
Mahone's got Burrows.

219
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:22,830
Scofield's on his way.

220
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,460
I will make it happen.

221
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:27,330
I'm going down there myself.

222
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,460
Uh, I assume we both know
which one that is.

223
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:43,730
I will call you
when I get down there.

224
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:59,060
MAHONE:
 <i>I just... I-I...</i>

225
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:01,360
I want you to listen
really close, okay?

226
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:02,830
PAM:
Alex, Alex, slow down.

227
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,030
Okay, okay.

228
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:06,660
I... We talked about
getting back together,

229
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:07,930
about giving it another shot.

230
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,830
Yes, and I said that
maybe we could.

231
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:13,900
Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.

232
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:14,930
Alex?

233
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:16,230
What about Colombia?

234
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,260
Cartegena?

235
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:18,300
What do you mean?

236
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,300
Go there?

237
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,460
You got summer break
coming up,

238
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:22,500
don't you? Same with Cam.

239
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,930
Yeah, but...

240
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,260
I'm not far from there

241
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:26,900
right now,
and I was thinking

242
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,360
that why not just
stick around

243
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:30,260
and have you guys
come down?

244
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:32,200
You always wanted
to go, didn't you?

245
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:33,430
Visit the homeland?

246
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,300
Yes, but you didn't.

247
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,160
Yeah, but I do now.

248
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:39,400
Uh...

249
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:43,060
Yeah. I mean, I suppose

250
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:44,830
we can maybe do two weeks

251
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:47,700
at the end of the summer...
Is that a yes?
That's a yes, right?

252
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,860
Yes, yes...

253
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:51,000
Come on, great coffee,
great beaches,

254
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:54,360
wildlife parks for Cam.
Alex, look, it might
not work out.

255
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:57,030
You've got to be
prepared for that, okay?

256
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:00,230
I... It can't be
like it was before.

257
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,060
It will never
be like before.

258
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:06,730
I know what's important now.
I know what matters.

259
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,430
Well, I guess I could...
I could look online.

260
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,900
I don't know, I should go.

261
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,160
Just come be with me, Pam.

262
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:16,830
Be with me.

263
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,060
(beep)

264
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:34,700
MARICRUZ:
 <i>Hey...</i>

265
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,430
You've got nothing
to worry about, okay?

266
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,930
It's you I'm marrying.

267
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:42,630
WOMAN:
Senor Gonzalez...

268
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:17,900
MAN:
U.S. Embassy operator.

269
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,030
I'm looking for a friend.

270
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:22,460
A missing American friend.

271
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:24,560
He could be
in the hospital.

272
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:25,860
Could be in jail.

273
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:28,200
What's the name?

274
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:30,160
Bellick...

275
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:32,560
Brad Bellick.

276
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:38,300
Hey! Hey, do I get to call
my lawyer or what?!

277
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,260
What are you savages down here?!

278
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:43,460
I get to call my lawyer
or something.

279
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:46,400
Freakin' banana benders.

280
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:58,200
Finally. That's him.

281
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:01,000
That's the guy.
He's the one who
killed that girl.

282
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:02,230
Good job, guys.

283
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,260
 <i>Bueno.</i>

284
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:07,100
Hey...

285
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,500
Aren't you going
to release me now?

286
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,360
Hey.

287
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:11,800
Hey!

288
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,360
You're busted.

289
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:18,360
Am I?

290
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:21,200
Where's the money?

291
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:23,460
Pretty boy's got it.

292
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:25,560
He's out there with
a royal flush

293
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:27,860
and you're in here
with a busted straight.

294
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:29,130
Hardly seems right, does it?

295
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,960
Your hand don't look
much better.

296
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:33,600
Maybe I got an ace
up my sleeve.

297
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:34,960
You know something I don't?

298
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,430
You should rest your leg, boss.

299
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:56,560
(speaking Spanish)

300
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,660
I was told we
could make a deal.

301
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:13,030
You're a long way
from home, boy.

302
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,530
Ain't no deal for you here.

303
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,930
You haven't heard
what I have to offer.

304
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,260
Guy looking like you do...

305
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:24,500
coming here...

306
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,200
the only think you're offering
is jail time.

307
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,960
I'm not a cop.

308
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:41,600
Check online.

309
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:43,500
Type in "Michael Scofield."

310
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,160
That means nothing to me.

311
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:46,960
Could mean 100 grand.

312
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:57,630
(whistles)

313
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:00,800
This takes longer than
30 seconds, you're in the canal.

314
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,830
Bait... for the catfish.

315
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:07,530
Hey...

316
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:20,600
You just gave me a 100,000
reasons to turn you in.

317
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:21,900
That's true.

318
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:25,500
I guess I'll just have
to give you a few more not to.

319
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:35,000
You know
I'm innocent.

320
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:36,930
Yeah? Probably.
And yet you don't care.

321
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,230
I don't care about
anything other than
getting my life back, no.

322
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,130
Your wife know
who you really are?

323
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,430
Yeah, you know how it is.

324
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,700
Good men doing bad things
because of circumstance.

325
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:50,460
I'd call her back
if I were you.

326
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:52,400
Tell her to forget
you were ever born.

327
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:54,130
Oh, you would, would you?

328
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,630
Stop the cancer from your life
spreading to theirs.

329
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,930
Cancer

330
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,300
of my life.

331
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,360
I wouldn't be begging
her to meet me in this

332
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:05,130
third world dump if it weren't
for you and your life.

333
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,130
There's no way out of this.

334
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:10,800
For you or for any of us.

335
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,530
For me there is.

336
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,660
For me there is.

337
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:26,530
How much of it
have you spent?

338
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,960
100,000...

339
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:30,430
200,000.

340
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:33,400
Of course, down here, it'd
be more like a million.

341
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:35,260
Be Louis XIV on a sum like that.

342
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:37,330
The Sun King of Panama.

343
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,960
You ain't gonna be seeing
much sun now.

344
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:41,830
I don't know.

345
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:48,200
You know, Bagwell,
out of all the guys,

346
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:52,800
all eight of 'em, you were the
guy I was hoping would go down

347
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:54,230
in a blaze of gunfire.

348
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:55,860
Why don't you give
me your best shot.

349
00:17:55,930 --> 00:17:57,260
Finish the job.

350
00:17:57,330 --> 00:17:59,200
||
Maybe I will.

351
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:04,830
That Siamese cat smile
just makes me want

352
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:07,000
to open you up
that much more.

353
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:08,830
It's Cheshire.

354
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,900
Cheshire cat smile.

355
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,360
Señor Bellick.

356
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,830
I'm free?

357
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:26,130
What the hell's this?

358
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,760
Hey, wait... wait a minute.

359
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:29,060
What about him?

360
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:30,400
He's the one
that did it.

361
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:31,560
 <i>Bueno suerte.</i>

362
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:32,830
 <i>"Bueno suerte"?</i>

363
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:35,130
 <i>"Bueno suerte,"</i>
what's that mean?

364
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,330
 <i>Bueno suerte--</i>
what does that mean?

365
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:40,560
 <i>Bueno suerte?</i>
Good luck.

366
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:05,760
Bellick.

367
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:08,830
Bellick!

368
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:12,760
Where is she, Bellick, huh?!

369
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:14,700
Where is she?!

370
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:18,760
(yelling)

371
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:23,030
Where's Maricruz?!
You want to know
where she is,

372
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:25,360
find a way
to get me out of this!

373
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:28,060
Get me out of here!

374
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:29,930
Get me out!

375
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:46,330
Maricruz...

376
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,530
Maricruz...

377
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:12,800
(seagulls calling)

378
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:59,660
Michael, that's
a beautiful boat.
Just promise me

379
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:01,830
you'll change the name
when you take it.

380
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,030
I don't think my mother

381
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,360
would have
approved of you.

382
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:07,030
Consider it done.
Come on.

383
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:08,160
Uncuff me.

384
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:09,830
No, not yet.

385
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,730
So is this the part
where you go back on your word?

386
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:14,400
Hands up. Hands up.

387
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,200
No.

388
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:19,730
And as of now

389
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:23,100
they want you alive.

390
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,730
Why?

391
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:28,160
That's a good question.

392
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:29,460
Figure it out someday
on your own time.

393
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:30,460
Where's the money?

394
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:33,230
Cut him loose.
No.

395
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:35,500
Come on, Alex,
you already got the boat.

396
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,700
Show a little good faith.

397
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:37,830
The money.

398
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:40,360
I want...
(phone rings)

399
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:44,460
I'm here. Where are you?
Yeah.

400
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:46,900
I'm inside the warehouse.

401
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,400
I'll be right there.

402
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:51,960
(dialing tones)

403
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:58,060
Here we go.

404
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:01,830
Hello. <i>Hola.</i>

405
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:04,200
You speak English?

406
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:07,830
Good. Yes, yes.
Miraflores Docks.

407
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:10,030
Yes, there's been
a murder.

408
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:12,500
A well-dressed Asian man
has just been shot

409
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:13,500
by two Americans.

410
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,960
Come.
Yes, come.

411
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,500
So you kill him and frame us.

412
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:23,730
Why?

413
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:29,530
So everyone will leave me alone.

414
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:32,360
'Cause that's all I want.

415
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:34,430
That and the money.

416
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,330
It's not gonna happen, Alex.

417
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,330
Let him go.

418
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,960
Give me the money.
Let him go.

419
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:40,200
Give me the money!

420
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:03,900
Don't be shy.

421
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,830
They're all yours.

422
00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:10,500
You said you'd have them
right where we wanted them.

423
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,430
This isn't right where
we want them.

424
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,200
ALEX:
Well...

425
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:16,800
that's your job now.

426
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:18,930
Oh.

427
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,530
ALEX:
This is as far as I go.

428
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:23,030
Or is it something else?

429
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:26,360
Another reason we're all here.

430
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:28,230
Like that.

431
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:31,360
Like a double-cross.

432
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:32,360
Yeah, just like that.

433
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:33,400
Say good-bye.

434
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:39,060
Like minds think alike,
eh, Alex?

435
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,300
(bones crack)

436
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:37,760
(sirens approaching)

437
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:00,330
(engine starts)

438
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:05,930
Once seated,
your four-piece

439
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,060
will be mounted
to the floor mount.

440
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:10,230
During transport,
do not speak to either...

441
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,100
I know the drill.

442
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:16,560
Get in.

443
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:42,300
GUARD:
So, what do we got,
another 30 minutes?

444
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:44,560
Yeah, something like that.

445
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:46,730
Why didn't you take
the freeway?
Rush hour.

446
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:50,460
Aw, hell.

447
00:25:50,530 --> 00:25:51,560
What?

448
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:53,630
The engine light
just came on.

449
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:56,530
It just got serviced
at motor pool.

450
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,830
Yeah, we better pull over
just to make sure.

451
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:15,800
All right,
I'll check it out.

452
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:26,030
In the French Resistance
it was considered a high honor

453
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:27,400
to face a Nazi firing squad;

454
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:29,100
I thought I told you
to be quiet.

455
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,430
Meant you did your job.

456
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:34,460
The highest honor was to smile
when they shot you.

457
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:38,960
Took you long enough.

458
00:26:47,530 --> 00:26:49,500
(ship horn blares)

459
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:53,860
Lake Gatun,
Eastern Canal,

460
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:56,700
approaches
to Cartagena. $27.50

461
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,660
What's that
crossing take?

462
00:26:58,730 --> 00:27:00,160
Two days
if you're under

463
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:01,960
full sail all the time.

464
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:03,700
Good time of you
to be down here.

465
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:04,960
No storms, nothing.

466
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:06,930
Had enough storms
recently.
(chuckles)

467
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,160
Enjoy it.
It's a beautiful
crossing.

468
00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:10,160
I plan to.

469
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:11,660
This boat here,

470
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:12,860
who's it belong to?

471
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:13,900
Señor?

472
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,330
We got a call that

473
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,330
this boat was used
in some illegal trafficking.

474
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,700
It's the wrong
boat, pal.

475
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,830
You can check it
if you want to, but...

476
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:23,460
Hey, you can't just...

477
00:27:23,530 --> 00:27:24,800
This is Panama, friend.

478
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:27,100
Get acquainted
with the law, huh?

479
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:31,300
I...

480
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,700
About two keys of cocaine.

481
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:37,360
Yes, I definitely think
you need to get acquainted.

482
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:38,460
Chico.

483
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:44,460
Oh... I...

484
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,330
 <i>Vamanos.</i>

485
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:53,060
LINCOLN:
You think they got him?

486
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:54,260
It's a pretty
singular boat.

487
00:27:54,330 --> 00:27:56,560
That's a lot of coke
to be carrying around.

488
00:27:56,630 --> 00:27:57,830
If you're at
the helm, man...

489
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:00,300
Be doing some serious
time; ten years minimum.

490
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:01,800
Yeah, you would.

491
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:02,930
We lost the boat.

492
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,800
At least we got
dead man's money.

493
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:07,900
It's out ticket to
the rest of our lives,

494
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,360
minus what I'm sending
Westmoreland's daughter.

495
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:12,000
Hey.

496
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:13,830
You showed up.

497
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,030
We had a deal.

498
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:17,460
This is my brother.

499
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:18,560
This way.

500
00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:23,700
So we get out of here,
and we never look back.

501
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,530
We never look back.

502
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:36,500
I want to thank you,
Michael, for everything.

503
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,300
You're welcome.

504
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,760
It's the best I could do
with the money you gave me.

505
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:44,900
MICHAEL:
That'll work.

506
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:48,430
 <i>Gracias.</i>

507
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:49,500
 <i>Gracias.</i>

508
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,800
She's very pretty.

509
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:55,060
She'll get us
where we need to go, right?

510
00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:56,730
Not the boat, señor.

511
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,400
(chuckles)

512
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:23,760
So, I got your message.

513
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,860
Thank God, I found you guys.

514
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:32,700
"Thank God"
is right.

515
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,760
Michael, Lincoln's free.

516
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:36,130
What?

517
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,730
Uh, it's all over the news.

518
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:39,730
Paul Kellerman

519
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,330
came forward

520
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,930
and he had, he had
everything documented

521
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,360
and he made a full confession.

522
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:46,360
Are you serious?

523
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:47,730
Yeah.

524
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,700
Everything?

525
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:52,230
Everything, all charges.

526
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:54,900
Whoa.

527
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:05,030
What, uh...? No more...

528
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:06,860
That means you don't have
to run anymore.

529
00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:13,500
What about Michael?

530
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:16,630
Uh, a friend of my father's
getting into it,

531
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:20,500
but he's pretty confident
that under the circumstances

532
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:22,300
nobody's going
to pursue you on this.

533
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,460
I need a drink.

534
00:30:28,530 --> 00:30:30,160
(laughs)

535
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:32,530
I'll go see
what I can find.

536
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:52,900
Here.

537
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,030
Help me
out of this.

538
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:02,230
We did it, Linc.

539
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:06,230
We did it.

540
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:07,200
Yeah.

541
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:08,900
No...

542
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,730
you almost did it.

543
00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:20,960
You want the money?!

544
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:25,660
Take the money. Take it.

545
00:31:25,730 --> 00:31:28,500
You think this is
about the money?

546
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,530
Pocket change
like five million?

547
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,830
Then what is it about?

548
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:36,700
My brother's
been exonerated.

549
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:38,060
The President stepped down.

550
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:40,830
We're not a threat anymore.
It's over.

551
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:43,000
You may be done with us,

552
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:44,700
but that doesn't mean
we're done with you.

553
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:46,530
The police are
on their way.

554
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,730
LINCOLN:
It started with me.

555
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,160
Let my brother go.

556
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:52,030
Oh, that's sweet.

557
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:53,600
That's sweet.

558
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:55,600
You don't hear that much
anymore, that sort

559
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:57,300
of fidelity
in families.

560
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,230
Two brothers that'll go
to the ends of the earth

561
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:00,930
for each other.

562
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,900
Too bad only one of you survive.

563
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,930
Don't!
(gunshot)

564
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:13,460
(sirens approaching)

565
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,030
We got to go.

566
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:24,030
(sirens blare)

567
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:34,830
(yells in Spanish)

568
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,260
* *

569
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:20,600
(door creaks)

570
00:33:28,330 --> 00:33:30,860
(panting)

571
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,900
My men are ordered
to fire if you don't

572
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,460
come out of there
with your hands first.

573
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:42,130
Come on, come on.

574
00:33:45,630 --> 00:33:47,760
Murder is not something
that we take lightly

575
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:49,160
here on Panamanian soil.

576
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:52,060
So come on out of there

577
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:53,830
and there will
be no more death.

578
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:56,360
Michael, I took
a man's life.

579
00:33:56,430 --> 00:33:59,530
Don't think
about that now.

580
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,430
You and I have got a date,
remember?

581
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:02,700
Two limes and a couple

582
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:03,860
of beers,
don't forget that.

583
00:34:03,930 --> 00:34:06,530
This is your
last warning!

584
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,200
Give me the gun.

585
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,530
I took a man's life.

586
00:34:14,430 --> 00:34:16,160
We're going to walk
out of here together,

587
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:19,360
and we'll tell them
exactly what happened.

588
00:34:19,430 --> 00:34:20,530
(cries)

589
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,900
(crying)

590
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:24,160
Look at me,
look at me, look at me.

591
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:26,230
Then we're going to
tell them what happened.

592
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:27,830
Okay.

593
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:30,130
We'll explain everything.

594
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:34,130
And I'm going to do
whatever I can to help you.

595
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:35,930
Okay?

596
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,630
Yeah.

597
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:42,060
Now give me the gun.

598
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,030
Here.

599
00:34:58,130 --> 00:35:00,630
I love you.

600
00:35:02,730 --> 00:35:05,060
I love you, too, Sarah.

601
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:22,030
'Kay.
You all right?

602
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:23,230
All right.
Yeah.

603
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:24,860
Come on.

604
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:30,900
Don't move!

605
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:33,200
I'll shoot!

606
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:34,530
Nody

607
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:39,030
(y iSpanh)

608
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:40,660
u cric eryth
No! Don't move!

609
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:44,860
No, I can't let you do this.

610
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,800
Michael!Michael!

611
00:35:46,930 --> 00:35:48,830
Now it's time to say thank you.

612
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:50,660
It was me.
It was me!

613
00:35:50,730 --> 00:35:52,660
He's innocent!
I did it!

614
00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:54,730
I did it!
He's innocent!

615
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,230
It was me!
He's done
nothing wrong!

616
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:57,500
Please! Please!
I did it!

617
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:58,960
It was me.

618
00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:00,360
He's done nothing wrong.
He hasn't

619
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:02,330
shot anybody, he hasn't hurt
anybody, please. Michael!

620
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,360
Michael, tell
them the truth!

621
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:06,200
Michael!

622
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,160
He's done nothing wrong!

623
00:36:30,530 --> 00:36:32,160
(cell phone rings)

624
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:35,500
Hello?

625
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,160
Hey, it's me.

626
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:38,830
Ooh, getting impatient.

627
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:42,500
Reminds me of
when we were in college.

628
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:45,430
Did you buy the tickets yet?

629
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,000
No, I'm still looking.

630
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:48,930
Don't.

631
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,600
What?

632
00:36:54,830 --> 00:36:56,900
Forget about them.

633
00:36:57,430 --> 00:36:58,600
Forget I ever existed.

634
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:23,800
Excuse me.

635
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:24,800
Do you speak English?

636
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:26,300
Yes, can I help you?
Yeah.

637
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,400
I'm looking
for a woman--

638
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:29,030
Sarah Tancredi.
She was brought in

639
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:30,330
to give her statement
and then released.

640
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:32,560
You just missed her.

641
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:42,700
Sarah!

642
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:20,030
Ah... ah!

643
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:26,330
I thought you'd never show up.

644
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,560
Okay, uh, when am I
getting out of here?

645
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:30,360
That's the thing.

646
00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:33,200
There's been a hiccup.

647
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:35,430
(chuckles):
A hiccup.

648
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:37,330
Look, you got me...

649
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,400
you got me fair
and square in Mexico,

650
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:40,030
all right?

651
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:42,330
I did what you wanted me to do.

652
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,200
Now it's time to cut me
loose just like we agreed.

653
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:48,860
Getting caught wasn't part
of the agreement.

654
00:38:48,930 --> 00:38:50,630
I got caught running your setup,
being your bait.

655
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:51,960
Now I got you Scofield
down here,

656
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:56,160
I got you what you wanted.

657
00:38:57,230 --> 00:38:58,660
You got caught, Bagwell.

658
00:38:58,730 --> 00:39:00,230
Hey, wh... where...

659
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:02,060
where you going?!

660
00:39:02,130 --> 00:39:03,930
Where you going?!

661
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,560
I got you what you want!

662
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:10,100
I got them boys down here!

663
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,200
I did what you told me to do!

664
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:13,860
Do you hear me?!

665
00:39:13,930 --> 00:39:16,760
I did what you told me to do!

666
00:39:17,930 --> 00:39:19,960
I did what you told me!

667
00:40:28,430 --> 00:40:30,260
This is as far as I go.

668
00:40:57,330 --> 00:41:00,730
General...

669
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:03,160
I trust this is
a safe place to speak.

670
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:05,500
It's Scofield.

671
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,130
They got him.

672
00:41:45,730 --> 00:41:47,500
Scofield back in the penn.

673
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:48,960
Got to be honest,

674
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,460
didn't think
we'd see it happen.

675
00:41:53,530 --> 00:41:55,530
You know he's
gonna break out.

676
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:00,000
It's in his blood.

677
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,760
That's exactly
what we want him to do.

678
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:46,700
* *

679
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:50,230
(men whooping aggressively)

680
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:53,230
(yelling, shouting)
