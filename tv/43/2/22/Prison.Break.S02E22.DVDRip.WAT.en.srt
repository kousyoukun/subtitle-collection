1
00:00:01,134 --> 00:00:02,601
<i>Previously on Prison Break:</i>

2
00:00:02,769 --> 00:00:06,205
A very credible witness has just come
forward and he's willing to testify.

3
00:00:06,373 --> 00:00:09,171
He'll corroborate everything
you've said about this conspiracy.

4
00:00:09,342 --> 00:00:10,775
Who?

5
00:00:12,412 --> 00:00:15,404
How much do you know
about Sona, Mr. Kim?

6
00:00:15,582 --> 00:00:19,382
Only what I've been given clearance on.
There's been a change in strategy.

7
00:00:19,552 --> 00:00:23,318
-How much further would I have to go?
-For this, you only have to go to Panama.

8
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:25,788
-I didn't know you were gonna be here.
-You e-mailed me. You said T-Bag was here.

9
00:00:25,992 --> 00:00:28,119
-It's on the website.
-I didn't write on no website.

10
00:00:28,294 --> 00:00:31,695
-This is looking more and more like a setup.
-He's got Maricruz locked away.

11
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:34,197
Either I help him get the money
or she's dead.

12
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:36,130
Freeze, Bagwell!

13
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:41,605
Theodore Bagwell. He's the one
you want for that dead chick in there.

14
00:00:41,775 --> 00:00:44,107
-Sucre, you better pull it together.
-Oh, God!

15
00:00:46,312 --> 00:00:48,212
Go get the money. Please.

16
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:50,980
Who you fooling?

17
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:54,120
You ain't gonna kill me,
Mr. Michelangelo.

18
00:00:54,287 --> 00:00:55,618
You ain't got it in you.

19
00:00:59,459 --> 00:01:00,949
-Linc?
-Hello, Michael.

20
00:01:01,428 --> 00:01:02,895
<i>What do you want, Alex?</i>

21
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:04,894
Bring me the money. Bring me the boat.

22
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:06,589
You are out of your mind.

23
00:01:06,766 --> 00:01:08,563
We have something
the other person needs.

24
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:10,430
<i>Your brother for your plan.</i>

25
00:01:10,603 --> 00:01:13,401
Five minutes. That's what you have.

26
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:24,912
<i>I didn't kill that man.</i>

27
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:28,011
<i>I'm getting you out of here.</i>

28
00:01:28,188 --> 00:01:30,850
<i>-I got three weeks.
-Just have a little faith.</i>

29
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:35,623
<i>I did everything I could.</i>

30
00:01:35,795 --> 00:01:37,160
<i>I know you did.</i>

31
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:52,875
Senor.

32
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,740
-Chicle?
-No.

33
00:01:56,916 --> 00:01:59,282
Soda? Beer, my friend.

34
00:02:00,587 --> 00:02:03,112
Spleef? Magic mushrooms.

35
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:05,120
Burst your brain, split it wide open.

36
00:02:06,326 --> 00:02:07,987
I'm your man, man.

37
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:10,186
Magic Mystery Tour,
right here in this box.

38
00:02:10,363 --> 00:02:13,196
If I don't got it, I can get it.

39
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:15,896
Beat it.

40
00:02:20,874 --> 00:02:23,206
<i>So you gonna do the right thing?</i>

41
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:26,010
Right for who, Alex?

42
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,245
<i>You've lost, Michael.</i>

43
00:02:28,414 --> 00:02:29,711
That's what you've done here.

44
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:33,876
You're gonna lose a whole lot more unless
you tell me right here and right now...

45
00:02:34,053 --> 00:02:37,181
...you're gonna bring me the money,
you're gonna bring me the boat.

46
00:02:37,357 --> 00:02:40,087
And you'll just let my brother go.

47
00:02:40,593 --> 00:02:41,821
Yeah.

48
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:47,262
Just like you let Tweener go
and Abruzzi and Haywire.

49
00:02:47,433 --> 00:02:49,333
Things are different now.

50
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:51,094
<i>-Really?
-Yeah.</i>

51
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:56,766
The people I was working for,
they kind of sold me down the river.

52
00:02:56,943 --> 00:02:59,173
Now, I just wanna go out to sea.

53
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:01,370
That's funny.
I'll have to remember that one.

54
00:03:01,548 --> 00:03:04,073
I face more prison time than you.

55
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:07,617
Sort of jumped ahead of you a few spots
on the public enemy list.

56
00:03:08,555 --> 00:03:11,115
You're my way to freedom, Michael,
and I'm yours.

57
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:13,282
<i>We both know
what the other one's capable of.</i>

58
00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:16,451
<i>Let's treat each other with respect here.
No games, no bluffing.</i>

59
00:03:16,629 --> 00:03:19,097
Just two guys doing each other a favor.

60
00:03:19,265 --> 00:03:21,290
<i>What do you say?</i>

61
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:25,237
Where are you?

62
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:28,306
Mira Flores shipping docks,
just outside of Panama City.

63
00:03:28,474 --> 00:03:31,204
It's a big warehouse right on the water.

64
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:32,935
That's a long ways.

65
00:03:33,112 --> 00:03:35,137
It'll take me at least 24 hours
to get there.

66
00:03:35,915 --> 00:03:38,247
Well, then, I'd get moving.

67
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:44,053
How's it feel being on the run?

68
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:47,151
-I'll survive.
-Not if they catch you.

69
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,125
They'll send you to the chair.

70
00:03:50,997 --> 00:03:52,555
You think that's ironic?

71
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:54,597
It'd be justice.

72
00:03:54,767 --> 00:03:56,291
Mr. Kim. Alex Mahone.

73
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:59,303
Call me.

74
00:03:59,472 --> 00:04:03,169
Oh, justice will be served.

75
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:10,007
What I'm about to divulge to you
will in all likelihood get me killed.

76
00:04:10,183 --> 00:04:13,482
-Actually, I guarantee it.
-Then why are you doing it?

77
00:04:15,355 --> 00:04:18,688
Because this was supposed to be
about country, about loyalty...

78
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:21,258
...about what's right, but it wasn't.

79
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:26,194
Because I wronged people
who should not have been wronged.

80
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:34,367
Those orders were given
by Caroline Reynolds...

81
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,770
...who was vice president at the time.

82
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:40,879
Acting on those orders,
I planted evidence.

83
00:04:41,047 --> 00:04:46,144
I procured a body, I lured Lincoln Burrows
into that parking garage that evening...

84
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:48,787
...under the auspices of a different hit.

85
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:54,688
From the ground up, we framed him.

86
00:04:58,231 --> 00:04:59,459
Perfect.

87
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:03,068
See, Lincoln Burrows gets executed,
people forget about Terrence Steadman...

88
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:05,636
...the controversy surrounding him
and the presidency.

89
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:08,968
And nobody ever knows
about the Company.

90
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:12,339
Yes, which is a shadowy cabal
of corporations...

91
00:05:12,512 --> 00:05:16,073
...that pretty much influence everything
that happens in this country.

92
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:19,741
But I fail to see how any of this
is relevant to Sara Tancredi...

93
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,820
...and the fact that she aided and abetted,
that she jumped bail.

94
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:26,686
She did so because she feared for her life,
which was appropriate...

95
00:05:26,859 --> 00:05:28,827
...as I had orders to kill her.

96
00:05:52,452 --> 00:05:54,249
Hey.

97
00:05:57,957 --> 00:05:59,686
You still in the magic business?

98
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:04,458
-What's your name?
-Chaco.

99
00:06:05,932 --> 00:06:07,524
<i>It's all here.</i>

100
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:11,158
Everything Mr. Kellerman said
is corroborated in these documents.

101
00:06:11,337 --> 00:06:14,135
In light of this evidence,
my question, I guess to you...

102
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:16,775
...is whether your time
and resources are best spent...

103
00:06:16,943 --> 00:06:19,377
...in pursuing charges
against Dr. Tancredi.

104
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:24,980
No. My office will drop all charges
effective immediately.

105
00:06:26,586 --> 00:06:29,453
But, Your Honor, I would like
to devote my time and attention...

106
00:06:29,622 --> 00:06:33,524
...in prosecuting this man, Mr. Kellerman.

107
00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:35,752
Officer.

108
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:44,331
I literally don't even know
what to say to you.

109
00:06:45,371 --> 00:06:47,862
It was good knowing you, Sara.

110
00:06:55,948 --> 00:06:57,939
-Yeah?
-Where are we?

111
00:06:58,117 --> 00:06:59,675
<i>I'm in Panama. Nice place.</i>

112
00:07:00,453 --> 00:07:02,444
Good weather. Cool breeze.

113
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:04,487
Where are we with the brothers?

114
00:07:05,324 --> 00:07:08,487
<i>When you get them, I wanna
come down there for confirmation.</i>

115
00:07:08,661 --> 00:07:10,094
<i>I suggest you get on a plane.</i>

116
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:14,097
Because by the time you get here, I'll have
Scofield and Burrows where you want them.

117
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,633
And then this whole thing is over.

118
00:07:29,515 --> 00:07:31,005
Sara, it's me.

119
00:07:31,184 --> 00:07:33,311
It's a strange thing...

120
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:37,547
...leaving a message for someone you know
is never gonna get it.

121
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:40,691
I can only assume the worst...

122
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:45,820
...so this'll be the last message
I'll leave for you.

123
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,530
I just wanted you to know that I made it.

124
00:07:52,705 --> 00:07:55,071
But it's no good without you.

125
00:07:59,078 --> 00:08:01,137
Anyway, remember when I...?

126
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:04,215
Remember when I told you
about those 50-cent beers...

127
00:08:04,383 --> 00:08:07,284
...in Baja at happy hour?

128
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:10,147
Well, they're even cheaper down here.

129
00:08:10,857 --> 00:08:13,849
And if by some miracle you do get this...

130
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:17,786
...I need you to listen close.

131
00:08:19,765 --> 00:08:21,665
Sara.

132
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:23,964
Sara, I suggest we get you out of here.

133
00:08:24,136 --> 00:08:28,402
It's gonna be a media circus outside
and it'll only get bigger. Let's go.

134
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:30,707
Sure.

135
00:08:30,877 --> 00:08:36,338
<i>Larger unexpected fireworks at the trial
of Dr. Sara Tancredi in Chicago today.</i>

136
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:39,883
<i>New testimony has implicated
that former President Reynolds...</i>

137
00:08:40,052 --> 00:08:44,546
<i>...was complicit in the falsification
of her brother Terrence Steadman's death.</i>

138
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:47,386
<i>The fallout from all this,
the purported killer...</i>

139
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:52,088
<i>...Lincoln Burrows, who has led the country
on a nationwide manhunt...</i>

140
00:08:52,265 --> 00:08:55,701
<i>...will be exonerated of all charges
effective immediately.</i>

141
00:08:57,270 --> 00:09:00,433
Oh, my God, Bruce. Lincoln's a free man.

142
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:41,737
Michael left me a message.
Okay. My God.

143
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:46,714
He doesn't know.
He's still planning on running.

144
00:09:48,688 --> 00:09:51,452
Come on, Michael. Come on,
come on, come on.

145
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:54,892
Let me do the intro.

146
00:09:55,061 --> 00:09:57,256
Fine. Then I'll do the talking.

147
00:10:04,403 --> 00:10:05,631
Okay, I gotta go to him.

148
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:07,500
-What's that, about 3000 miles?
-It is.

149
00:10:07,673 --> 00:10:11,370
So we're gonna have to swing by my hotel,
and you'll have to get me to the airport.

150
00:10:11,544 --> 00:10:15,310
He's gotta know he doesn't have to run.
What he's doing is gonna get him killed.

151
00:10:19,685 --> 00:10:22,483
The stars are finally aligning, sir.

152
00:10:23,155 --> 00:10:25,646
Mahone's got Burrows.
Scofield's on his way.

153
00:10:27,893 --> 00:10:31,454
I will make it happen.
I am going down there myself.

154
00:10:35,768 --> 00:10:39,761
I assume we both know
which one that is.

155
00:10:43,776 --> 00:10:46,540
I will call you when I get down there.

156
00:11:01,193 --> 00:11:04,685
I just-- I want you to listen really,
really close, okay?

157
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:07,560
<i>-Alex, Alex, slow down.
-Okay, okay, fine.</i>

158
00:11:07,733 --> 00:11:10,759
We talked about getting back together,
about giving it another shot.

159
00:11:10,936 --> 00:11:13,666
Yes, and I said that maybe we could.

160
00:11:16,942 --> 00:11:19,035
<i>-Alex?
-What about Colombia?</i>

161
00:11:19,545 --> 00:11:21,945
-Cartagena?
-Go there?

162
00:11:22,114 --> 00:11:24,275
<i>Well, you got summer break
coming up, don't you?</i>

163
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:26,748
<i>-Same with Cam?
-Yeah. But--</i>

164
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:28,944
Listen, I'm not far from there
right now...

165
00:11:29,121 --> 00:11:32,716
...and I was thinking that why not just stick
around and have you guys come down?

166
00:11:32,892 --> 00:11:35,019
I mean, you always wanted to go,
didn't you?

167
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:38,129
-Visit the homeland?
-Yes, but you didn't.

168
00:11:38,798 --> 00:11:40,026
Yeah, but I do now.

169
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:47,537
Yeah. I mean, I suppose I could,
we could maybe do two weeks...

170
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,174
<i>...at the end of the summer, or--</i>

171
00:11:49,341 --> 00:11:51,707
-Is that a yes? That's a yes, right?
-Yes, yes.

172
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:54,471
Great coffee, great beaches,
wildlife parks for Cam and--

173
00:11:55,281 --> 00:12:00,776
Look, it might not work out.
You've gotta be prepared for that, okay? l--

174
00:12:00,953 --> 00:12:03,046
It can't be like it was before.

175
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:07,886
It will never be like before.

176
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,290
I know what's important now.
I know what matters.

177
00:12:10,463 --> 00:12:13,261
<i>Well, I guess I could look online.</i>

178
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:15,463
<i>I don't know. I should go.</i>

179
00:12:15,634 --> 00:12:16,999
Just come be with me, Pam.

180
00:12:18,003 --> 00:12:19,664
<i>Be with me.</i>

181
00:12:35,955 --> 00:12:39,186
Hey, you got nothing
to worry about, okay?

182
00:12:39,358 --> 00:12:40,757
It's you I'm marrying.

183
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:45,458
Senor Gonzales.

184
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,596
<i>U.S. Embassy operator.</i>

185
00:13:21,767 --> 00:13:25,294
I'm looking for a friend.
A missing American friend.

186
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:29,168
He could be in the hospital.
He could be in jail.

187
00:13:29,341 --> 00:13:31,036
<i>Name?</i>

188
00:13:31,944 --> 00:13:35,937
Bellick. Brad Bellick.

189
00:13:37,283 --> 00:13:40,878
Hey! Hey, do I get to call
my lawyer or what?!

190
00:13:41,053 --> 00:13:43,453
What are you, savages down here?

191
00:13:43,622 --> 00:13:46,716
I get to call my lawyer or something.

192
00:13:46,892 --> 00:13:49,224
Freaking banana benders.

193
00:13:59,471 --> 00:14:01,029
Finally! That's him!

194
00:14:01,574 --> 00:14:03,838
That's the guy.
He's the one that killed that girl.

195
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:05,340
Good job, guys.

196
00:14:08,647 --> 00:14:11,343
Hey. Hey, aren't you gonna
release me now?

197
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:13,212
Hey.

198
00:14:13,385 --> 00:14:14,613
Hey!

199
00:14:18,424 --> 00:14:21,052
-You're busted.
-Am I?

200
00:14:23,162 --> 00:14:26,325
-Where's the money?
-Pretty Boy's got it.

201
00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:30,696
He's out there with a royal flush,
and you're in here with a busted straight.

202
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:34,567
-That hardly seems right, does it?
-Your hand don't look much better.

203
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,435
Maybe I got an ace up my sleeve.

204
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:39,077
You know something I don't?

205
00:14:41,146 --> 00:14:43,910
You should rest your leg, boss.

206
00:15:11,677 --> 00:15:13,668
I was told we could make a deal.

207
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:17,306
You're a long ways from home, boy.
There ain't no deal for you here.

208
00:15:17,516 --> 00:15:19,746
You haven't heard what I have to offer.

209
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:26,850
A guy looking like you do, coming here?

210
00:15:27,026 --> 00:15:30,018
Only thing you offering is jail time.

211
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:35,633
I'm not a cop.

212
00:15:42,341 --> 00:15:46,300
Check online.
Type in Michael Scofield.

213
00:15:46,478 --> 00:15:47,968
That means nothing to me.

214
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:49,774
Could mean a hundred grand.

215
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:07,956
This takes longer than 30 seconds,
you're in the canal.

216
00:16:09,268 --> 00:16:12,032
Bait for the catfish.

217
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:14,670
Hey.

218
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:27,551
You just gave me a hundred thousand
reasons to turn you in.

219
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,017
That's true.

220
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:32,646
I guess I'll just have to give you
a few more not to.

221
00:16:40,065 --> 00:16:41,623
You know I'm innocent.

222
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,098
-Yeah, probably.
-And yet you don't care.

223
00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:47,363
I don't care about anything
other than getting my life back, no.

224
00:16:47,539 --> 00:16:49,268
Your wife know who you really are?

225
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,574
Hey, you know how it is.

226
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:54,736
Good men doing bad things
because of circumstance.

227
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:59,545
I'd call her back if I were you.
Tell her to forget you were ever born.

228
00:16:59,718 --> 00:17:01,276
Oh, you would, would you?

229
00:17:01,453 --> 00:17:03,785
Stop the cancer
from your life spreading to theirs.

230
00:17:05,657 --> 00:17:07,989
Cancer of my life?

231
00:17:08,627 --> 00:17:11,460
I wouldn't be begging her to meet me
in this third world dump...

232
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:13,359
...if it weren't for you and your life.

233
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:17,969
There's no way out of this for you.
For any of us.

234
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,066
For me, there is.

235
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,735
For me, there is.

236
00:17:32,317 --> 00:17:37,584
-How much of it you spend?
-A hundred thousand. Two.

237
00:17:37,756 --> 00:17:39,747
Of course, down here,
be more like a million.

238
00:17:39,925 --> 00:17:42,416
Be Louis XIV for a sum like that.

239
00:17:42,594 --> 00:17:44,494
The Sun King of Panama.

240
00:17:44,663 --> 00:17:47,131
You ain't gonna be seeing
much sun now.

241
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:50,597
I don't know.

242
00:17:52,137 --> 00:17:57,632
You know, Bagwell, out of all the guys,
all eight of them...

243
00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:01,678
...you were the guy I was hoping
would go down in a blaze of gunfire.

244
00:18:01,847 --> 00:18:04,407
Why don't you give me your best shot?
Finish the job.

245
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,346
Maybe I will.

246
00:18:09,555 --> 00:18:14,356
That Siamese cat smile just makes me
wanna open you up that much more.

247
00:18:14,526 --> 00:18:18,189
It's Cheshire. Cheshire cat smile.

248
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:23,993
I'm free?

249
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:30,872
Hey.

250
00:18:31,043 --> 00:18:32,874
Hey, what the hell is this?

251
00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:36,208
Hey, wait, wait a minute.
What about him?

252
00:18:36,381 --> 00:18:38,110
He's the one that did it.

253
00:18:41,253 --> 00:18:44,484
<i>What's that mean? Buena suerte?
What does that mean?</i>

254
00:18:46,158 --> 00:18:48,149
Good luck.

255
00:19:11,783 --> 00:19:13,683
Bellick.

256
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:17,147
Bellick!

257
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:19,916
<i>Where is mi Maricruz?</i>

258
00:19:20,592 --> 00:19:21,820
Where is she?

259
00:19:29,768 --> 00:19:32,532
You wanna know where she is,
find a way to get me out of this!

260
00:19:33,605 --> 00:19:35,197
Get me out of here!

261
00:19:35,374 --> 00:19:38,605
Sucre, get me out of this! Get me out!

262
00:19:51,723 --> 00:19:54,351
Maricruz.

263
00:19:56,261 --> 00:19:58,286
Maricruz.

264
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:06,826
Michael, that's a beautiful boat.

265
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:09,331
Just promise you'll change the name
when you take it.

266
00:21:09,501 --> 00:21:12,095
I don't think my mother
would have approved of you.

267
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,171
Consider it done. Come on.

268
00:21:14,339 --> 00:21:16,432
-Uncuff me.
-No, not yet.

269
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:18,872
So is this the part
where you go back on your word?

270
00:21:19,845 --> 00:21:21,676
Hands up, hands up.

271
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:26,049
No.

272
00:21:26,218 --> 00:21:30,279
As of now, they want you alive.

273
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:31,888
Why?

274
00:21:33,392 --> 00:21:35,326
That's a good question.

275
00:21:35,494 --> 00:21:38,190
Figure it out some day, on your own time.
Where's the money?

276
00:21:38,363 --> 00:21:40,388
-Cut him loose.
-No.

277
00:21:40,565 --> 00:21:42,658
Come on, Alex.
You already got the boat.

278
00:21:42,834 --> 00:21:44,995
-Show a little good faith.
-The money.

279
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:47,533
I want--

280
00:21:50,008 --> 00:21:51,942
<i>-Yeah?
-I'm here. Where are you?</i>

281
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:54,044
I'm inside the warehouse.

282
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,514
I'll be right there.

283
00:22:03,255 --> 00:22:05,223
Here we go.

284
00:22:06,792 --> 00:22:08,987
<i>-Hello?
-Hello.</i>

285
00:22:10,062 --> 00:22:12,087
<i>-You speak English?
-Yes, sir. Can I help you?</i>

286
00:22:12,264 --> 00:22:14,994
<i>-Yes, yes. Mira Flores docks.
-Everything all right?</i>

287
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:17,727
<i>-Yes. There's been a murder.
-Are you in danger?</i>

288
00:22:17,903 --> 00:22:20,667
A well-dressed Asian man
has just been shot by two Americans.

289
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:23,103
<i>-We'll send a car right away.
-Come. Yes, come.</i>

290
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:28,335
So you kill him and frame us.

291
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:31,873
Why?

292
00:22:32,884 --> 00:22:36,684
So everyone will leave me alone.

293
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:41,591
Because that's all I want.
That, and the money.

294
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:45,218
-It's not gonna happen, Alex. Let him go.
-Give me the money.

295
00:22:45,397 --> 00:22:47,365
-Let him go.
-Give me the money!

296
00:23:03,482 --> 00:23:05,780
I am dumbfounded.

297
00:23:12,324 --> 00:23:15,760
Well, don't be shy. They're all yours.

298
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:20,861
You said you'd have them right
where we wanted them.

299
00:23:21,032 --> 00:23:23,296
This isn't right where we want them.

300
00:23:23,468 --> 00:23:26,767
Well, that's your job now.

301
00:23:28,473 --> 00:23:30,464
This is as far as I go.

302
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:32,971
Or is it something else?

303
00:23:34,713 --> 00:23:36,271
Another reason we're all here?

304
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:38,143
Like that.

305
00:23:40,285 --> 00:23:43,311
-Like a double-cross.
-Yeah, just like that. Say goodbye.

306
00:23:45,857 --> 00:23:48,985
Great minds think alike, eh, Alex?

307
00:24:56,761 --> 00:24:59,662
Okay, come on, come on.

308
00:25:15,046 --> 00:25:18,038
Once seated, your four-piece
will be mounted to the floor-mount.

309
00:25:18,216 --> 00:25:20,514
During transport,
do not speak to either I, myself--

310
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:22,380
I know the drill.

311
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:27,390
Get in.

312
00:25:50,115 --> 00:25:53,915
-So, what have we got, 30 minutes?
-Yeah, something like that.

313
00:25:54,085 --> 00:25:56,645
-Why didn't you take the freeway?
-Rush hour.

314
00:25:59,157 --> 00:26:01,318
-Oh, hell.
-What?

315
00:26:01,493 --> 00:26:05,429
-The engine light just came on.
-It just got serviced at motor pool.

316
00:26:05,597 --> 00:26:08,760
Yeah. We've gotta pull over
just to make sure.

317
00:26:24,049 --> 00:26:25,744
All right, I'll check it out.

318
00:26:34,025 --> 00:26:37,324
In the French Resistance, it was
a high honor to face a Nazi firing squad.

319
00:26:37,495 --> 00:26:40,658
-Thought I told you to be quiet.
-Meant you did your job.

320
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:45,031
The highest honor was to smile
when they shot you.

321
00:26:47,672 --> 00:26:49,606
Took you long enough.

322
00:27:01,886 --> 00:27:03,683
Lake Gatun. Eastern canal.

323
00:27:03,855 --> 00:27:06,824
Approaches to Cartegena.
Twenty-seven-fifty.

324
00:27:06,992 --> 00:27:08,619
What's that crossing take?

325
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:11,728
Two days
if you're under full sail all the time.

326
00:27:11,896 --> 00:27:14,694
Good time of year to be down here.
No storms. Nothing.

327
00:27:14,866 --> 00:27:16,857
Had enough storms recently.

328
00:27:17,035 --> 00:27:20,129
-Enjoy it. It's a beautiful crossing.
-I plan to.

329
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:22,830
This boat here. Who does it belong to?

330
00:27:23,608 --> 00:27:24,836
Senor?

331
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:27,945
We got a call that this boat was used
in some illegal trafficking.

332
00:27:28,113 --> 00:27:31,412
It's the wrong boat, pal.
You can check it if you want to, but, hey--

333
00:27:31,583 --> 00:27:34,711
-Hey, you can't just go to--
-Hey, this is Panama, friend.

334
00:27:34,886 --> 00:27:37,013
Get acquainted with the law, huh?

335
00:27:40,125 --> 00:27:41,990
-l--
-Coca.

336
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:47,320
Yes, I definitely think you need
to get acquainted with it.

337
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:49,433
Chico.

338
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:54,395
Well, I....

339
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:04,573
-You think they got him?
-It's a pretty singular boat.

340
00:28:04,749 --> 00:28:07,809
That's a lot of coke to be carrying around.
If you were at the helm--

341
00:28:07,986 --> 00:28:10,250
I'd be doing some serious time.
Ten years, minimum.

342
00:28:10,422 --> 00:28:13,050
Yeah, you would. We lost the boat.

343
00:28:13,224 --> 00:28:15,158
At least we got dead man's money.

344
00:28:15,326 --> 00:28:17,260
It's our ticket to the rest of our lives...

345
00:28:17,429 --> 00:28:19,863
...minus what I'm sending
Westmoreland's daughter.

346
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:21,931
Hey.

347
00:28:22,767 --> 00:28:24,962
-You showed up.
-We had a deal.

348
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:27,401
-That's my brother.
-Hey.

349
00:28:27,572 --> 00:28:29,472
This way.

350
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:33,636
So we get out of here
and we never look back.

351
00:28:34,312 --> 00:28:36,405
We never look back.

352
00:28:42,287 --> 00:28:45,279
I wanna thank you, Michael,
for everything.

353
00:28:46,591 --> 00:28:48,456
You're welcome.

354
00:28:50,361 --> 00:28:52,727
It's the best I could do
with the money you gave me.

355
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:55,923
That'll work.

356
00:29:01,873 --> 00:29:05,001
-She's very pretty.
-She'll get us where we need to go, right?

357
00:29:05,176 --> 00:29:07,303
Not the boat, senor.

358
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:33,701
So I got your message.

359
00:29:35,406 --> 00:29:38,034
Thank God I found you guys.

360
00:29:40,745 --> 00:29:42,679
Thank God is right.

361
00:29:42,847 --> 00:29:44,974
Michael, Lincoln's free.

362
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:47,118
What?

363
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:51,619
It's all over the news.
Paul Kellerman came forward.

364
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:55,351
And he had everything documented
and he made a full confession.

365
00:29:55,527 --> 00:29:58,087
-Are you serious?
-Yeah.

366
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:01,891
-Everything?
-Everything. All charges.

367
00:30:07,672 --> 00:30:09,936
What a....

368
00:30:11,075 --> 00:30:15,011
Man, what a-- No more....

369
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:17,648
It means you don't have to run anymore.

370
00:30:21,186 --> 00:30:23,381
What about Michael?

371
00:30:23,555 --> 00:30:26,547
A friend of my father's
is getting into it...

372
00:30:26,724 --> 00:30:29,818
...but he's pretty confident
that under the circumstances...

373
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:32,224
...nobody's gonna pursue you on this.

374
00:30:37,569 --> 00:30:39,696
I need a drink.

375
00:30:40,538 --> 00:30:43,063
I'll go see what I can find.

376
00:31:00,725 --> 00:31:02,488
Here.

377
00:31:03,261 --> 00:31:04,956
Help me out of this.

378
00:31:11,269 --> 00:31:13,362
We did it, Linc.

379
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:17,331
-We did it.
-Yeah.

380
00:31:17,508 --> 00:31:18,873
No.

381
00:31:20,478 --> 00:31:21,706
You almost did it.

382
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:34,849
You want the money?

383
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:38,127
Take the money. Take it.

384
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:41,730
You think this is about the money?

385
00:31:44,135 --> 00:31:46,000
Pocket change? Like 5 million?

386
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:49,162
Then what is it about?
My brother's been exonerated.

387
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:53,299
The president stepped down.
We're not a threat anymore. It's over.

388
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:57,177
You may be done with us,
but that doesn't mean we're done with you.

389
00:31:57,715 --> 00:32:01,651
-The police are on their way.
-This started with me.

390
00:32:01,819 --> 00:32:05,585
-Let my brother go.
-Oh, that's sweet, that's sweet.

391
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:09,784
You don't hear that much anymore,
that sort of fidelity in families.

392
00:32:09,961 --> 00:32:13,419
Two brothers who will go to the ends
of the earth for each other.

393
00:32:14,232 --> 00:32:16,359
Too bad only one of you will survive.

394
00:32:16,534 --> 00:32:18,434
No!

395
00:32:29,847 --> 00:32:31,838
We gotta go.

396
00:33:48,626 --> 00:33:53,120
My men have orders to fire if you don't
come out the there with your hands first.

397
00:33:58,569 --> 00:34:03,063
Murder is not something that we take
lightly here on Panamanian soil.

398
00:34:03,241 --> 00:34:05,835
So come on out of there
and there will be no more deaths.

399
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:08,478
Michael, I took a man's life.

400
00:34:09,247 --> 00:34:11,374
Don't think about that now.

401
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:13,881
You and I have got a date, remember?

402
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:16,520
Two limes and a couple of beers.
Don't forget that.

403
00:34:16,687 --> 00:34:19,053
This is your last warning.

404
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:20,713
Give me the gun.

405
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:24,994
I took a man's life.

406
00:34:26,931 --> 00:34:32,392
We're gonna walk out of here together
and we'll tell them exactly what happened.

407
00:34:34,005 --> 00:34:36,633
No, look at me, look at me, look at me.

408
00:34:37,308 --> 00:34:39,572
Now, we're gonna tell them
what happened.

409
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:42,577
-Okay.
-We're gonna explain everything.

410
00:34:43,181 --> 00:34:46,275
And I'm gonna do
whatever I can to help you.

411
00:34:46,851 --> 00:34:50,048
-Okay?
-Yeah.

412
00:34:52,890 --> 00:34:55,085
Now, give me the gun.

413
00:34:55,827 --> 00:34:57,522
Here.

414
00:35:04,869 --> 00:35:06,632
You ready?

415
00:35:11,042 --> 00:35:13,135
I love you.

416
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:17,543
I love you too, Sara.

417
00:35:32,864 --> 00:35:34,126
-Okay.
-You ready?

418
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:35,629
-Yeah.
-All right.

419
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,234
-Yeah.
-Come on.

420
00:35:43,407 --> 00:35:45,034
Don't move!

421
00:35:45,209 --> 00:35:46,904
I'll shoot!

422
00:35:47,078 --> 00:35:49,546
-Michael, what are you doing?
-Nobody moves! Nobody!

423
00:35:51,849 --> 00:35:54,784
-You sacrificed everything for me once.
-No.

424
00:35:54,952 --> 00:35:57,978
-No! Don't move!
-No, I won't let you do this.

425
00:35:58,156 --> 00:35:59,885
Michael. Michael!

426
00:36:00,057 --> 00:36:04,153
Now it's time to say thank you.
It was me! It was me!

427
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:06,558
-I did it!
-He's done nothing wrong!

428
00:36:06,731 --> 00:36:09,996
-He's innocent!
-I did it! It was me.

429
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:12,762
-I did it! It was me.
-He's done nothing wrong.

430
00:36:12,937 --> 00:36:15,667
He hasn't shot anybody,
he hasn't hurt anybody. Michael.

431
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,671
Michael, tell them the truth!

432
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:21,471
Michael! He's done nothing wrong!

433
00:36:45,903 --> 00:36:47,427
Hello?

434
00:36:48,673 --> 00:36:49,935
Hey, it's me.

435
00:36:50,107 --> 00:36:54,100
Oh, getting impatient.
Reminds me of when we were in college.

436
00:36:56,314 --> 00:36:57,781
Did you buy the tickets yet?

437
00:36:58,449 --> 00:37:00,883
<i>No, I'm still looking.</i>

438
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:02,280
Don't.

439
00:37:03,421 --> 00:37:07,187
-What?
-Forget about them.

440
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:11,194
Forget I ever existed.

441
00:37:35,686 --> 00:37:38,678
-Excuse me. You speak English?
-Yes. Can I help you?

442
00:37:38,856 --> 00:37:41,154
Yeah. I'm looking for a woman.
Sara Tancredi.

443
00:37:41,325 --> 00:37:45,386
She was brought in to give her statement,
and then released. You just missed her.

444
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:55,833
Sara!

445
00:38:29,573 --> 00:38:31,632
Oh, God.

446
00:38:32,576 --> 00:38:34,339
I thought you'd never show up.

447
00:38:37,248 --> 00:38:40,649
Okay, when am I getting out of here?

448
00:38:41,452 --> 00:38:44,683
That's the thing. There's been a hiccup.

449
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:47,514
A hiccup?

450
00:38:48,092 --> 00:38:49,616
Look, you guys got me.

451
00:38:49,794 --> 00:38:52,627
You got me fair and square
in Mexico, all right?

452
00:38:52,797 --> 00:38:56,324
I did what you wanted me to do. Now,
it's time to cut me loose like we agreed.

453
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,491
Getting caught wasn't part
of the agreement.

454
00:38:58,669 --> 00:39:00,534
I got caught running your setup.

455
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:03,170
Being your bait.

456
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:06,242
Now, I got you Scofield down here.
I got you what you wanted.

457
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:10,446
You got caught, Bagwell.

458
00:39:12,483 --> 00:39:14,542
Wait. Where you going?!

459
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:16,380
Where you going?

460
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:20,915
I got you what you wanted!
I got them boys down here!

461
00:39:21,092 --> 00:39:24,061
I did what you told me to do!

462
00:39:24,595 --> 00:39:28,725
Do you hear me?
I did what you told me to do!

463
00:39:28,899 --> 00:39:31,026
I did what you told me!

464
00:40:41,238 --> 00:40:43,832
This is as far as we go.

465
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:10,494
General.

466
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:16,535
I trust this is a safe place to speak.

467
00:41:16,707 --> 00:41:18,766
It's Scofield.

468
00:41:18,943 --> 00:41:20,877
They got him.

469
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:01,650
Scofield back in the pen.

470
00:42:01,819 --> 00:42:05,778
Gotta be honest,
I didn't think we'd see it happen.

471
00:42:07,291 --> 00:42:09,282
You know he's gonna break out.

472
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:11,655
It's in his blood.

473
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:15,756
That's exactly what we want him to do.
