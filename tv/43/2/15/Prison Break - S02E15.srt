00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:06,320
Previously on "Prison Break":

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:08,930
Yes? I'd like the number
for Channel 11 news, please.

3
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:11,280
Hang up the phone, now!

4
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:15,120
This is Michael Scofield. I'm
at the Cutback motel, room 11...

5
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:20,520
And I want to turn myself in.

6
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:24,880
Where is that?

7
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:26,600
It's Holland, where I grew up.

8
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:28,420
You know that.

9
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:31,030
It's beautiful.

10
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:32,400
This message is for Maricruz.

11
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:37,360
I'll be there in the airport
in Ixtapa waiting for you.

12
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,700
Hi, my name is Sara, and I'm an addict.

13
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:42,660
Hi, Sara. Hi, Sara.

14
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:45,800
I'm just looking to do my
time; I don't any any trouble.

15
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:47,500
Hey!

16
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:48,800
Break it up, convict!

17
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:50,430
No, no, this isn't fun
- What was fun

18
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:52,660
Was when Caroline and
I would talk about you

19
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:55,060
And the schoolboy crush
that you had on her.

20
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:57,600
He proposed to her.

21
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,100
Hey! Terrence!

22
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:01,700
I'm leaving!

23
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:03,460
Terrence, listen to me.

24
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,460
Just listen. So many people

25
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,400
Have suffered because
of this, because of you.

26
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,900
When the press get here,
you can tell the truth.

27
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:12,400
You can end this.

28
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:13,960
Sorry.

29
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:20,330
<i>We interrupt this program
for a special news bulletin.</i>

30
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:23,330
It's breaking news out
of Cutback, Montana.

31
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,100
Lincoln Burrows and Michael
Scofield, two of the prisoners

32
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:29,260
Who broke out of Fox River
State Penitentiary in Illinois

33
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:31,360
Have continued to
allude the authorities,

34
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,500
Leaving a trail of crime in their wake.

35
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:37,160
And today, they left
behind something else.

36
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,760
My name is Lincoln
Burrows, and I'm innocent.

37
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,100
We're done. There's no
other way out of here.

38
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:52,900
Next time you decide to
hold a press conference,

39
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:54,600
Do it from a room with a back door.

40
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:57,030
Just let me think.

41
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,000
Montana Highway Patrol.

42
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:02,200
Michael Scofield and Lincoln Burrows,

43
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:04,360
You'll need to exit with
your hands in the air.

44
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,000
This is a warning.

45
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:11,430
Exit with your hands up.

46
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:13,330
What about him? What
about him? He's useless.

47
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,260
A dead body? We got
fingerprints everywhere.

48
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,160
Are you worried someone's
gonna pin a murder on you?

49
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,660
So what's your plan, leave the body

50
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:21,060
Walk out the front door? Yes.

51
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:23,260
That's exactly what we're going to do.

52
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,060
Michael Scofield and Lincoln Burrows,

53
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:27,100
You need to exit with your hands up.

54
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:30,330
FBI. Hold your fire.

55
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,860
FBI?

56
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:34,030
Start rolling. I have Burrows
and Scofield in custody.

57
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:36,860
We're coming out. Hold your fire.

58
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:55,100
Hold up, who are you?

59
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:56,860
Federal Bureau of Investigation.
We're going to Billings.

60
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:59,600
Wait a minute, let me see that ID again.

61
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:00,560
Okay. Drop the gun!

62
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,860
Don't do it!

63
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:04,100
Everybody calm down,
and this won't get ugly.

64
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:06,660
All right, you!

65
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,600
I want keys to both of cop cars now!

66
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:10,960
Do not do it! Don't listen
to him! Get the keys!

67
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,660
Linc, get in the car. What's going on?

68
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:15,530
We're getting out of here
before anyone else gets hurt.

69
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,100
Lincoln, start it. Come on! Come on!

70
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:18,930
Come on! Stay there or I will drop him.

71
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:22,400
I'm not gonna tell you again.
One more step and I drop him.

72
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:24,060
Come on!

73
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,830
Welcome back.

74
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:47,630
You feeling...? Much better.

75
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,800
Update?

76
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:52,260
Okay, you got it.

77
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,830
Get a lead on something?

78
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:59,560
One of the COs from
Fox River, Brad Bellick,

79
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,230
Got locked up last night

80
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:02,730
For the murder of another guard.

81
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,560
Wait, we're looking for COs now?

82
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,100
What about the escapees?

83
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:07,230
Scofield?

84
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:09,160
Burrows? Nothing on them currently.

85
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,460
Also, Franklin's wife...

86
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,230
Was taken into custody

87
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:14,460
In North Dakota. His wife?

88
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,760
Line two.

89
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:20,760
This is Agent Mahone.

90
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:27,960
How long ago?

91
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:41,530
I'll make you a deal
- If you don't move a muscle,

92
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,800
I won't blow your head off.

93
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:44,230
No one's gonna hurt you, Greg.

94
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:45,200
Where are we going,

95
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:46,700
Michael? Can't keep driving.

96
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:47,630
We lost Steadman.

97
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:49,200
Sara's in the wind. Shh!

98
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:50,600
Turn it up.

99
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:51,900
Are armed and dangerous.

100
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:53,600
Burrows was sentenced to die

101
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:55,460
For the murder of the
president's brother.

102
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,130
The president could not be reached

103
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,160
As she continues to tour the Midwest.

104
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,700
I want to thank all of you who

105
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:02,830
Have supported me in the
past, and I appreciate

106
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:04,860
Your continued support
in the upcoming year.

107
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,830
Reynolds travels to Colorado tomorrow

108
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:09,530
For a scheduled appearance
in Denver this evening.

109
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:12,230
Pull over.

110
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:13,900
What for?

111
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:18,200
Just pull over.

112
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:44,330
Want to drop off this kid?

113
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,000
Later.

114
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:47,760
We should get rid of Kellerman, too.

115
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,960
We don't need him.

116
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,330
Actually, we do.

117
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,200
We still have assets.

118
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,960
It's just a question of how we use them.

119

Nurse.

123
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:44,330
Nurse!

124
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:47,500
You ain't no nurse.

125
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:49,360
You right about that.

126
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,200
Oh, that's a pretty
shiner you got, Captain.

127
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:52,800
Must make you think about all the times

128
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:55,530
You walked around here in
your fancy guard outfit,

129
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,960
Turning a blind eye

130
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,030
To everything you saw that was wrong.

131
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:02,300
"Who me? Oh, I didn't see nothing. "

132
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:04,360
How that blind eye feel now?

133
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,060
You son of a bitch.

134
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,200
Get used to it.

135
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:08,360
Hear old one-Eyed jack's

136
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,160
Gonna be getting screwed in the socket.

137
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,430
Over my dead body. No.

138
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:16,130
A dead man can't feel a beat-Down.

139
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,300
And you got a lot more coming your way.

140
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:21,660
Come on now, let's go.

141
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,530
It'll take the feds a
while to figure that out.

142
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,260
What time is it?

143
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,660
A little after 9:00.

144
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:01,830
It's gonna be tight.

145
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:03,400
450 miles in six hours.

146
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:05,400
What do you think? Got to move
now if we're going to make it.

147
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:07,000
Eyes front.

148
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:11,560
Hey, look at this.

149
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,300
It's perfect. You ready?

150
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:20,700
Yep.

151
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,830
Puerto Rico.

152
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:24,400
Ugh!

153
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:26,800
Here, Larry, that's for you.

154
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:28,630
What about this?

155
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:30,160
This is too small.

156
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,660
Why didn't it float?

157
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:35,030
Why didn't it...?

158
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:36,230
I need more wood.

159
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,430
Wood floats.

160
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:40,730
This will work.

161
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:44,630
Hey, man.

162
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:54,600
We were just wondering if
you could buy us some beer.

163
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:56,060
Huh?

164
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:01,830
Yeah, sure.

165
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:04,860
Can I get some food for my dog, too?

166
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,760
Do whatever thing you got to do, man.

167
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,500
You can even keep a beer for yourself.

168
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:12,360
Huh? Oh, no.

169
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,400
My dad used to drink.

170
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:37,860
You're going to want to see this.

171
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:41,660
We've shut down every freeway

172
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,130
In central Montana.

173
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,960
So far, no sign of them. Go wider.

174
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,830
Get troopers on and
90 and 94, all the way

175
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:48,560
Through Wyoming, and call Whitefish.

176
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,560
Have him lock down the
Canadian border at 15.

177
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,860
Recapping our top story on
the Fox River Eight, we will

178
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:56,400
Now bring you exclusive footage shot by

179
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:59,200
A cameraman who was
kidnapped by the escapees.

180
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:01,700
My name is Lincoln
Burrows, and I'm innocent.

181
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:05,260
I escaped from Fox River Penitentiary

182
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:07,360
Because I was sentenced
to death for a crime

183
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,160
I did not commit.

184
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,460
I did not murder Terrence Steadman.

185
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:15,960
He committed suicide last night
in the Cutback Motel, 30 miles

186
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,130
Outside of his home
in Blackfoot, Montana.

187
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,430
He killed himself out of fear.

188
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:23,460
Fear of the people who
have been hiding him

189
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,860
For the past three years.

190
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:27,660
The same people who
want my brother dead.

191
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:32,230
They don't want you to know
who they are, but know this:

192
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:34,100
They've stolen billions of dollars

193
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:36,500
And murdered dozens of innocent people.

194
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:38,730
And yet they plaster
our faces on the news,

195
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,860
And tell you to be afraid.

196
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,860
They are a group of multinationals

197
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,630
With corporate interests.

198
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:46,060
Together, they're known as The Company.

199
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,500
They are working

200
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:49,030
With the highest levels of government,

201
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:51,860
Including the president
of the United States.

202
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:56,530
Damage control immediately,
before this hits page one.

203
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,330
It's already airing, sir.

204
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,700
Start a wildfire in Florida!

205
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:01,060
Find a lost storage unit

206
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:03,260
Full of Arabs! I do not care!

207
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,930
As long as it's not
about Lincoln Burrows!

208
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:08,500
And they operate with impunity Go!

209
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:13,160
Under the cover of the Secret Service,
少几句字幕，听一下，一起械秸饫锢

210
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,250
Xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

211
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:03,830
Dr. Sara Tancredi.

212
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:05,960
Do we know how long the videotape lasts?

213
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,100
26 minutes, beginning to end.

214
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:09,700
It's all online.

215
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:12,730
I know I can't ask
you for another chance.

216
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,900
I can only hope that, by now,

217
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:17,330
You've found your safe haven.

218
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,460
Start a transcript.

219
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,830
I need every word.

220
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:24,400
...your commitment to help
others, and I put you in a place

221
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:26,900
That's every doctor's nightmare.

222
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:28,960
I wish I could do things differently...

223
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,260
Call Montana, have them
send an agent to talk

224
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:33,230
To the cameraman
- I want to know what he saw, what he heard,

225
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:34,630
What they were wearing
- Anything he can give us.

226
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:37,800
...people murdered by
government operatives.

227
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:40,560
One man, Special Agent Alexander Mahone,

228
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,930
Is responsible for
multiple deaths. He murdered

229
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,530
Not only John Abruzzi
and David Apolskis,

230
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:49,260
But also the last fugitive
he was assigned to chase:

231
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,530
A man named Oscar Shales.

232
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,560
A man who escaped from
prison two years ago,

233
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,860
Who remains one of this
country's most wanted

234
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:59,600
Despite the fact he will never be found.

235
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:01,230
The guy's nuts.

236
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:03,230
He'll do whatever it takes to
make the deaths look official-

237
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:05,530
Like they happened in the line of duty-

238
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,900
Disappearances, accidents...

239
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:12,100
Hey, thank you. Sure. Here you go.

240
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:19,760
What's the wood for?

241
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:23,130
I'm building a raft.

242
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:26,460
I need more wood if I'm
going to make it to Holland.

243
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,500
Holland? Yeah.

244
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,860
Want to see it?

245
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:34,730
The raft?

246
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:39,400
You're going to try to get
from here to Holland in that?

247
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:41,530
Uh-Huh.

248
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,260
Yeah, good luck, Gilligan.

249
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:45,360
I'm going to take a leak.

250
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:49,330
How are you going to
know where you're going?

251
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,230
Do you have, like, a map or anything?

252
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:56,160
Yeah. I do.

253
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:59,430
It's-It's right...

254
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:01,230
Oh, it's right here.

255
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,100
That's your map?

256
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:10,800
Uh-Huh.

257
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:15,300
Well, I really hope you make it.

258
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,460
You know, every morning, I wake up

259
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,960
And wonder what it would
be like to just disappear.

260
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:26,560
And you're just going to do it.

261
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:29,400
I think it's great.

262
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:37,060
Okay. Well...

263
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:44,900
What happened to your arm?

264
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:57,430
My dad drinks, too.

265
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,430
=以上为第二断=

266
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:02,960
What's going on?

267
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,230
Oh, nothing. No, no. No, no, don't...

268
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:06,700
Let me go.

269
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:08,060
I just want to fix it. Let me go.

270
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,060
No, I just want... Stop!

271
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,630
Matt, will you take me home, please?

272
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:15,800
No, I...

273
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,460
Freak.

274
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:49,830
All right, now, Brad, how we doing?

275
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:51,400
I could be better.

276
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:53,460
Yeah, that's a nasty contusion,

277
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:56,300
But it should go down in about 24 hours.

278
00:18:56,330 --> 00:18:58,730
I got your paperwork
here for your transfer

279
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,230
Back to Gen Pop.

280
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:02,000
Already?

281
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:04,530
Move 'em in, move 'em
out; you know the policy.

282
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,660
Katie...

283
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:07,860
Mm-Hmm?

284
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:10,330
You look nice today.

285
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,700
You worked here over tenyears, right?

286
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:20,360
Something like that.

287
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,700
That's a long time we've been friends.

288
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:26,600
Brad, if you think I can
pull some strings to keep you

289
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:28,660
Out of Gen Pop, I can't do that.

290
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:31,260
Please. Please, You
can't send me back there.

291
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:33,730
Do you want that responsibility,
knowing what they'll do to me?

292
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,600
Just listen, please.

293
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:36,760
One more night.

294
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,800
Just let me stay here tonight.

295
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:42,560
I know you can do that.

296
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,160
And when you go home,

297
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:47,630
Just leave that door open for me.

298
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,600
<i>They hung a sheet</i>

299
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:57,130
Behind their heads on the wall.

300
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,600
One of them-

301
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:01,030
The guy with the gun
- He found it

302
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:03,730
While Burrows and Scofield were talking

303
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,430
About how far they had to go.

304
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:11,200
Uh... Scofield said something
about 450 miles in six hours.

305
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,960
450 miles to where?

306
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,530
I don't know.

307
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:22,600
450 miles in six hours.

308
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:24,860
Any point on this circle

309
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:27,030
Could be their final destination.

310
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:30,660
75 miles per hour, stopping for gas.

311
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:32,300
It's doable. Yeah.

312
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:33,730
Where are they?

313
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:36,930
I'm not sure.

314
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,400
I still need more time.

315
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:41,230
This can't happen fast
enough, Mr. Mahone.

316
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:43,660
They've already done irreparable damage.

317
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:46,830
Scofield made the video in
a storage facility somewhere

318
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:48,460
Between Great Falls and Helena

319
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,300
Not long after sunrise.

320
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:51,800
From there, the witness said

321
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:54,800
They had 450 miles to
get where they were going.

322
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:56,130
There's Seattle,

323
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,860
Portland, Salt Lake, Denver...

324
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,630
Denver?

325
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:01,500
Yes. What?

326
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:03,430
The president is speaking
there this afternoon.

327
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:05,900
3:00.

328
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:12,260
Six hours from when they made the video.

329
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,230
<i>By escaped convicts Lincoln
Burrows and Michael Scofield</i>

330
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:21,860
<i>Was immediately dismissed
by the Justice Department</i>

331
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:24,460
<i>As entirely baseless, which
brings us back to the story</i>

332
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,760
We'll be continuing to
follow throughout the day.

333
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:29,500
The terror threat has
been raised to Orange

334
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:31,860
As a storage unit rented
by several Arab Americans

335
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,430
Was suddenly...

336
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:36,430
They buried it, dumped it off
the front page and buried it.

337
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:37,600
It's what they do.

338
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:39,130
They can spin it all they want,

339
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,430
It's out there now.

340
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:43,500
Give it time; the tape is going to work.

341
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:45,860
This is a Hail Mary, man
- If we don't get to her...

342
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:47,060
Getting to her is the easy part.

343
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,500
It's what we do after
that's the problem.

344
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:50,700
Which is why this has to happen quickly.

345
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:53,060
Once anyone knows we have
her, the curtain comes down.

346
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,300
Well, I'll notify the White House
to cancel the President's speech.

347
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:00,100
No. If there's any
change to her itinerary,

348
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:01,530
The brothers will know something's up,

349
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,030
And they're gonna go
right back into hiding.

350
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:04,700
We've found them before, we
can certainly find them again...

351
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:07,600
These are not pets, Agent Wheeler.

352
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:11,660
Yeah, thanks, I'm pretty clear on that,

353
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,560
But if you're going to
use the commander-In-Chief

354
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,930
As bait, it's certainly not going to...

355
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,130
You have a problem with
the way that I do things?

356
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,000
Yeah.

357
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:24,700
And I'm not the only one.

358
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,360
Is that right?

359
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,130
Internal Affairs has asked
me to run all your moves

360
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,700
Through them from here on out.

361
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,930
Then get a pen

362
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:50,800
And make sure you get
this word-For-Word.

363
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:54,800
The president's day does not change.

364
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:56,200
The only lead we have is that

365
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:57,730
We know where these men are headed.

366
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,230
So we're gonna keep quiet about this

367
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:02,660
And let 'em come.

368
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:06,330
Now, get out of my office.

369
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:13,460
They're two of the most
recognizable faces in America.

370
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,600
How do they think they were going to get

371
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:16,860
Anywhere near the president?

372
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:20,100
Because it's not just
the two of them anymore.

373
00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:22,560
I'm gonna go take a
closer look at that video.

374
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:27,830
If I may, sir, the president...

375
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:31,400
Are you certain we should
keep her in the dark on this?

376
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:36,460
Because there is a scenario where...

377
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,400
She could be useful.

378
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:45,000
It is... her ass on the line, sir.

379
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:48,060
And I think we're all
pretty clear she's been known

380
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:52,060
To get her hands dirty when
that line gets too close.

381
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:55,560
We should let her know

382
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,460
Just how close it is.

383
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:13,660
They did a good job masking the room.

384
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:15,300
No reflections, no flares.

385
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:16,900
Audio markers
- Church bells,

386
00:26:16,930 --> 00:26:18,530
Construction, traffic, anything?

387
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,760
The room tone tells us
they were in a large space-

388
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,800
About 100,000 cubic feet.

389
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:25,360
So the kid with the camera
- His story matches up?

390
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,760
We clocked the quality of light

391
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,000
With the time of day,

392
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:29,530
And it pretty much fits
his wheres and whens.

393
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:31,430
All right, content.

394
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:34,330
The usual tells
- Eyes, hands, feet.

395
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,000
Burrows, we were able to baseline him

396
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:37,330
Off the footage from his trial,

397
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,060
So we got even more clarity there.

398
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:41,460
I escaped from from
Fox River Penitentiary

399
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:44,460
Because I was sentenced to death
for a crime I did not commit.

400
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:47,260
I did not murder Terrence Steadman.

401
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:48,230
Okay, there.

402
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:50,260
The eyes.

403
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,500
See it?

404
00:26:51,530 --> 00:26:53,300
Yeah, slight shift to the left, then up.

405
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:56,230
Yeah, blink rate's up
here versus the pattern.

406
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:58,760
He committed suicide last
night in the Cutback Motel

407
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:02,660
30 miles outside from this
home in Blackfoot, Montana.

408
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:05,330
He's lying.

409
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,100
Seems so.

410
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:12,030
Okay, here, Burrows,

411
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:13,660
Arms folded.

412
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:15,800
He's protecting himself.

413
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:17,000
We'll do whatever it takes...

414
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:18,560
Not a lot of confidence in these words.

415
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,500
...like they happen in the line of duty.

416
00:27:20,530 --> 00:27:22,860
Okay, that means something
other than what he's saying.

417
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:25,200
Like our father Aldo Burrows...

418
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:28,260
Posture, shoulders in, for emphasis.

419
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:29,800
Really wants your attention here.

420
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:32,200
Our attorney, Veronica Donovan...

421
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:33,900
I was on the phone... Right there.

422
00:27:33,930 --> 00:27:35,530
...when they shot her like
an animal. Adam's apple.

423
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,630
Zoom in, zoom in.

424
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:39,130
We made this tape to
let the world know...

425
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,330
That's a lie.

426
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,860
Yeah.

427
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:43,160
His behavior is textbook.

428
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,360
If there's anything in here

429
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,630
About what they plan on doing in Denver,

430
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:47,430
They're gonna tell us.

431
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:53,730
If you say it that way,
it plays too earnest.

432
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,530
'Course it will
- It's the truth.

433
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,530
Okay, but the truth sends
them home to the wife and kids.

434
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:58,930
Lies will keep them busy.

435
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,230
I'm not telling a lie
to the whole country.

436
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:03,330
It's our one chance to say it out...

437
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,630
Yeah, say whatever the hell you want-

438
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:06,530
Tell them you're the Green Lantern-

439
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,460
But I know how they
break down these tapes.

440
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:09,600
I've done it.

441
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:12,200
Every detail matters.

442
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:14,200
Bin Laden crosses his
legs- Right over left-

443
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:16,700
Tells us something completely
different than left over right.

444
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:18,160
It's not the same message.

445
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,960
To them, it is.

446
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,560
If you want this plan
to work, whatever you say

447
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,600
With your mouths, you need to be saying

448
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:26,630
Something different with
your bodies and your eyes.

449
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:29,260
Slightly up and to the left.

450
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:32,895
Yes.

451
00:28:32,925 --> 00:28:32,930
=以上为第三段下部分=

452
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,230
Much blame has been placed
on another innocent person...

453
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:37,760
President's motorcade is rolling in.

454
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,430
So far no sign of the brothers.

455
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:40,400
Right there. Right there.

456
00:28:40,430 --> 00:28:41,600
What's Scofield doing with his hand?

457
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,300
We've been throwing them
a bunch of fast balls.

458
00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:46,900
What do you say we mix it up a little?

459
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:48,230
Like what?

460
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:50,830
We think it's Morse code.

461
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:52,200
For what?

462
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:56,000
Right now we've got a
phrase, "The water is warm. "

463
00:28:56,030 --> 00:28:57,960
Any idea what that might mean?

464
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,330
What the hell does that mean?

465
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,900
Nothing.

466
00:29:00,930 --> 00:29:03,300
But it'll take the Feds a
while to figure that out.

467
00:29:03,330 --> 00:29:06,160
We have teams checking
the surrounding counties

468
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,260
For the water temps.
It might be a message

469
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:09,960
To an accomplice.

470
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:13,400
The North Platte river
runs through the city.

471
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:14,400
Maybe they're trying to use...

472
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:15,860
It doesn't mean anything.

473
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,460
He's traveling with an
ex-Secret Service guy.

474
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,300
I'm guessing they're
spoon-Feeding us every lead

475
00:29:19,330 --> 00:29:20,460
They want us to follow.

476
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,900
So all this is just a distraction

477
00:29:21,930 --> 00:29:23,330
While they go after the president?

478
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,600
They had to know the
tape would be discredited.

479
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:27,960
They had to know that
we'd talk to the cameraman.

480
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:30,360
Much blame has been placed

481
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:35,200
On another innocent
person, Dr. Sara Tancredi.

482
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,830
Sara, if you're listening,

483
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:41,160
I know I can't ask
you for another chance.

484
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,930
I only hope by now you've
found your safe haven.

485
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,600
I took advantage of you,

486
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:48,760
Of your commitment to help others

487
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:52,060
And put your in a place that's
every doctor's nightmare.

488
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,930
Sara, if you're listening,

489
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,530
I know I can't ask
you for another chance.

490
00:29:56,560 --> 00:30:00,460
I only hope by now you've
found your safe haven.

491
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:02,760
I took advantage of you,

492
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,260
Of your commitment to help others

493
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:07,600
And put your in a place that's
every doctor's nightmare.

494
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:09,960
...of your commitment to help others

495
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,060
And put you in a place

496
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:13,830
That's every doctor's nightmare.

497
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:15,830
I've considered many ways to apologize,

498
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:17,730
But I must arrive at one.

499
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,960
There's more of the same here.

500
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,600
Uh, body language, his tells...

501
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:24,530
If you ask me, it doesn't
look like he means this at all.

502
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:26,300
I don't care what it
looks like. Play it again.

503
00:30:26,330 --> 00:30:28,830
I don't see... Play it again.

504
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,130
I only hope by now you've
found your safe haven.

505
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:36,530
I took advantage of you,

506
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,260
Of your commitment to help others

507
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:41,030
And put you in a place that's
every doctor's nightmare.

508
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:42,430
His voice
- Would you say

509
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:44,130
He sounds sincere when
he's talking to her

510
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,200
As opposed to when he's
talking about their crimes?

511
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:47,660
I... I guess you could say that.

512
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:50,060
I did say that. Would you say that?

513
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,430
I wish I could do this differently,

514
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:53,230
But it's too late for that now. Yeah.

515
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:56,060
It's too late for you and for others.

516
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,400
People murdered by
government operatives...

517
00:30:57,430 --> 00:30:58,800
This isn't about Terrence Steadman,

518
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:00,100
And it's not about their innocence.

519
00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:02,330
What do you mean? They're not going

520
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,800
After the president; they're
going after the doctor.

521
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:06,830
I want everything we've
got on Sara Tancredi-

522
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:08,800
Friends, families, pen-Pals.

523
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:10,400
If anybody so much as
wrote her a thank-You note,

524
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:12,530
I want to know where
the hell they arenow!

525
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:10,830
Sara Tancredi.

526
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:13,460
Dad dead, mom dead.

527
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,460
E
- Mail account shows a minimal list of contacts

528
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:17,700
With very little activity.

529
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:20,030
Credit cards used mostly for groceries,

530
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:22,600
Sporadic clothing shopping and, uh,

531
00:33:22,630 --> 00:33:24,300
The purchase of single movie tickets.

532
00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:27,900
And ob-Gyn records tell us
she's had very little in the way

533
00:33:27,930 --> 00:33:29,000
Of sexual relationships recently.

534
00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:30,100
To tell you the truth,

535
00:33:30,130 --> 00:33:32,730
I would say the bulk of
her life was her work.

536
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:49,730
Excuse me, sir, where are you going?

537
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:12,300
Apparently, we took out a janitor.

538
00:34:13,730 --> 00:34:15,500
When it all comes down, all
of this will get cleared up.

539
00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:17,400
Well, it ain't coming
down if we don't get Sara.

540
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:19,060
She'll be here.

541
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:23,230
I want to speak to my brother.

542
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:27,160
We got to start thinking

543
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,830
About what to do if she doesn't show.

544
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:31,600
Or if she does.

545
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:36,000
What if the only reason
this guy's helping us

546
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:37,930
Is to get whatever information Sara has?

547
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:45,095
What if this is just one giant setup?

548
00:34:45,130 --> 00:34:46,130
=以上为第4断=

549
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,360
Well, good night.

550
00:35:10,330 --> 00:35:13,200
It's about time you come home.

551
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:17,560
Been out with that Feytek boy again?

552
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,200
Sasha.

553
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:21,260
You may

554
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:22,730
Look like me...

555
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:26,130
But you take after your
mom when it comes to boys,

556
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,700
Now, don't you?

557
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:29,860
Hopefully, with a little better taste.

558
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:36,160
Damn it, girl, you are
gonna show me some respect.

559
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:52,030
<i>I know Sara didn't have many friends.</i>

560
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:53,730
She's sort of a loner.

561
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,400
But you were her friend.

562
00:35:55,430 --> 00:35:58,130
I like to think so, yes.

563
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,660
And you have no idea where she is now?

564
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:01,960
No.

565
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,200
This is a transcript of the
Scofield-Burrows videotape.

566
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:08,730
I highlighted the part where
he talks directly to Sara.

567
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:11,900
Mean anything to you?

568
00:36:11,930 --> 00:36:14,000
No.

569
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:16,660
You have no idea where
she might meet him, if...

570
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:17,700
That's his plan?

571
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:20,130
No.

572
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:24,630
Is Brad Bellick still
here in the infirmary?

573
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:26,430
Yeah. Why?

574
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:29,130
You must be loving this.

575
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:32,800
I didn't drive all this way to gloat.

576
00:36:32,830 --> 00:36:35,100
Well, then what the
hell you come here for?

577
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:42,030
First, I really... got
to tip my cap to you.

578
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:44,030
You've managed to draw
a bead on the convicts

579
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:45,260
More often than my own staff.

580
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:46,860
Well, thanks for the "attaboy," but...

581
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:48,860
As you can see, the correctional system

582
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:50,860
Doesn't share your gratitude.

583
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:54,460
I won't take much of your time,
but I do have a few questions.

584
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:56,200
About...? Sara Tancredi.

585
00:36:56,230 --> 00:36:57,700
She listed you as a reference

586
00:36:57,730 --> 00:36:59,430
On her job application to work here.

587
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:00,600
You know her well?

588
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:06,500
I'd know her a lot better if you
can get my ass moved to Ad Seg.

589
00:37:06,530 --> 00:37:08,700
I have no influence

590
00:37:08,730 --> 00:37:11,400
With the D.O.C.
- You know that.

591
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:14,860
If you want my help, you do.

592
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:18,360
I'll talk to the warden
and see what I can do-

593
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,500
Right after you give me some answers.

594
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:23,960
Scofield likes to communicate
with Sara via coded message.

595
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:28,160
Do you recognize anything here?

596
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:31,230
Anything that he may be
trying to tell her? No.

597
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:33,030
I mean, he's saying he's sorry.

598
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:37,860
Not that that's gonna do any
good with Dr. Cold Shoulder.

599
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:39,630
But...

600
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:42,500
What?

601
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:46,460
Ad Seg.

602
00:37:50,930 --> 00:37:52,730
Yeah.

603
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:55,500
All right, you see here,

604
00:37:55,530 --> 00:37:57,400
Where it says this stuff
about "another chance. "

605
00:37:57,430 --> 00:37:59,130
"Safe haven. "

606
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:01,230
That's out of the big book.

607
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:02,560
What big book?

608
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:04,160
Alcoholics Anonymous.

609
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,360
Sara's in recovery.

610
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,660
Yeah, I'm aware of
that. Those are the names

611
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:11,030
Of some of the chapters
in the book they use in AA.

612
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:13,930
Do you have a copy of the
Alcoholics Anonymous book?

613
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:18,230
<i>Sara, if you're listening,</i>

614
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:21,400
<i>I know I can't ask
you for another chance.</i>

615
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:30,630
<i>I can only hope by now
you've found your safe haven.</i>

616
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:34,560
<i>I took advantage of you,
your commitment to help others</i>

617
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:37,360
<i>And put you in a place that's
every doctor's nightmare.</i>

618
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:45,530
<i>I've considered many ways to apologize,</i>

619
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:47,730
<i>But I must arrive at one.</i>

620
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:55,630
It's getting late. I know.

621
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:57,160
She's not here.

622
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,300
I know that, too.

623
00:38:59,330 --> 00:39:02,730
There is a chance she
didn't get the message.

624
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,760
Or maybe she's just sick of all this.

625
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,730
The girl bailed on you back in Gila.

626
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:10,030
What makes you think she's
gonna come running back now?

627
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:12,730
The same thing that's
been keeping us going

628
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:15,830
For the last three months: faith.

629
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:19,530
Yeah, well... reality's
kicking faith's ass, man.

630
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:21,760
Look... Wait, wait.

631
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,660
Wait? Man, we can't wait anymore.

632
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:26,600
Once again, Michael
Crane, Listen, listen.

633
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:28,360
Please report to the front desk.

634
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,660
You have a telephone call.

635
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:33,100
Michael Crane to the front desk.

636
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,360
Yeah. Sara Tancredi.

637
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:38,030
That's right. She
might be with them now.

638
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:39,860
Just... Yes! Just call the local police

639
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:42,660
In Akron and tell them
to get everyone they have

640
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:44,400
Over to St. Thomas Hospital now.

641
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:48,260
Um...

642
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:51,860
Michael Crane. I think
you have a call for me.

643
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:57,760
Thank you.

644
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:01,630
This is Mr. Crane.

645
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:04,930
It sounded better than "Origami. "

646
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:07,800
Even if you got the message,
I wasn't sure you'd respond.

647
00:40:07,830 --> 00:40:09,530
I
- I couldn't get to you in time.

648
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:11,760
This is the only thing I could think of.

649
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:17,500
I swore I'd leave you alone,
but I had to contact you.

650
00:40:17,530 --> 00:40:20,230
Because I have something?

651
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:22,300
How'd you know?

652
00:40:22,330 --> 00:40:26,600
Michael, back in Gila I
was coming back to you.

653
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:31,000
Somebody... grabbed me, and they, um,

654
00:40:31,030 --> 00:40:33,900
They told me that my father
had given me something.

655
00:40:33,930 --> 00:40:35,860
Did someone hurt you?

656
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:37,860
I
- I got away.

657
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:40,430
Uh...

658
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:44,660
Michael, I want for this to be over.

659
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:48,800
That makes two of us.

660
00:40:48,830 --> 00:40:52,360
Do you think that's possible?

661
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,230
With your help, yes.

662
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:56,460
It's just a question of looking

663
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:58,230
At whatever it is your father gave you.

664
00:40:58,260 --> 00:41:00,160
It's just...

665
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:03,530
It's just a key.

666
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:06,600
Well, we'll figure it out.

667
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:09,330
Together.

668
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,830
I like the sound of that.

669
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:19,230
Me, too.

670
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:38,030
Hello, Paul.

671
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:42,060
Madam President, it's been a while.

672
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:43,330
I know.

673
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:45,700
I'm calling to apologize.

674
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,900
Okay.

675
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:53,360
It all just got away from
me, and I ended up hurting

676
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:56,130
The one person who's
always been at my side.

677
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:58,300
I want you to come home, Paul.

678
00:41:58,330 --> 00:41:59,730
We can fix this.

679
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,060
Together.

680
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:03,860
But not with those brothers
running around the country

681
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:07,560
Tearing down the very
office you helped me build.

682
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:11,060
Caroline...

683
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:13,800
Bring them in, Paul, and
everything can go back

684
00:42:13,830 --> 00:42:15,460
To the way it was.

685
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:18,600
That is what you want, isn't it?

686
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:23,130
I have to go now.

687
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:25,300
I'll see you soon.

688
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:35,230
Did you talk to Sara?

689
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:38,630
In a few days, this should all be over,

690
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:41,300
One way or the other.

691
00:42:43,330 --> 00:42:44,800
Absolutely.

692
00:42:44,830 --> 00:43:44,860
