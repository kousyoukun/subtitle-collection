You know that.

9
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:31,030
It's beautiful.

10
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:32,400
This message is for Maricruz.

11
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:37,360
I'll be there in the airport
in Ixtapa waiting for you.

12
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,700
Hi, my name is Sara,
and I'm an addict.

13
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:42,660
Hi, Sara.
Hi, Sara.
(applause)

14
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:45,800
I'm just looking to do my time;
I don't any any trouble.

15
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:47,500
Hey!

16
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:48,800
Break it up, convict!

17
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:50,430
No, no, this isn't fun--
what was fun

18
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:52,660
was when Caroline and I
would talk about you

19
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:55,060
and the schoolboy crush
that you had on her.

20
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:57,600
He proposed to her.

21
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,100
Hey!
Terrence!

22
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:01,700
I'm leaving!

23
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:03,460
Terrence, listen to me.

24
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,460
Just listen.
So many people

25
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,400
have suffered because
of this, because of you.

26
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,900
When the press get here,
you can tell the truth.

27
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:12,400
You can end this.

28
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:13,960
Sorry.

29
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,400
(yelling)

30
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:20,330
 <i>We interrupt this program</i>
 <i>for a special news bulletin.</i>

31
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:23,330
It's breaking news
out of Cutback, Montana.

32
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,100
Lincoln Burrows and Michael
Scofield, two of the prisoners

33
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:29,260
who broke out of Fox River State
Penitentiary in Illinois

34
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:31,360
have continued to allude
the authorities,

35
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,500
leaving a trail of crime
in their wake.

36
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:37,160
And today, they left behind
something else.

37
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,760
My name is Lincoln Burrows,
and I'm innocent.

38
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,100
We're done.
There's no other
way out of here.

39
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:52,900
Next time you decide to hold
a press conference,

40
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:54,600
do it from a room
with a back door.

41
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:57,030
Just let me think.

42
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,000
MAN (over bullhorn):
Montana Highway Patrol.

43
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:02,200
Michael Scofield
and Lincoln Burrows,

44
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:04,360
you'll need to exit
with your hands in the air.

45
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,000
This is a warning.

46
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:11,430
Exit with your hands up.

47
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:13,330
What about him?
What about him?
He's useless.

48
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,260
A dead body?
We got fingerprints everywhere.

49
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,160
Are you worried someone's
gonna pin a murder on you?

50
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,660
So what's your plan,
leave the body

51
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:21,060
walk out the front door?
Yes.

52
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:23,260
That's exactly
what we're going to do.

53
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,060
Michael Scofield
and Lincoln Burrows,

54
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:27,100
you need to exit
with your hands up.

55
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:30,330
FBI. Hold your fire.

56
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,860
MAN:
FBI?

57
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:34,030
Start rolling.
I have Burrows and
Scofield in custody.

58
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:36,860
We're coming out.
Hold your fire.

59
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:55,100
Hold up, who are you?

60
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:56,860
Federal Bureau of Investigation.
We're going to Billings.

61
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:59,600
Wait a minute,
let me see that ID again.

62
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:00,560
Okay.
Drop the gun!

63
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,860
(yelling)
Don't do it!

64
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:04,100
Everybody calm down,
and this won't get ugly.

65
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:06,660
MICHAEL:
All right, you!

66
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,600
I want keys to both
of cop cars now!

67
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:10,960
Do not do it!
Don't listen to him!
Get the keys!

68
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,660
Linc, get in the car.
What's going on?

69
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:15,530
We're getting out of here
before anyone else gets hurt.

70
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,100
Lincoln, start it.
Come on! Come on!

71
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:18,930
Come on!
Stay there or I
will drop him.

72
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:22,400
I'm not gonna tell you again.
One more step and I drop him.

73
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:24,060
Come on!

74
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:31,600
(tires screeching)

75
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,830
LANG:
Welcome back.

76
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:47,630
You feeling...?
Much better.

77
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,800
Update?

78
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:52,260
Okay, you got it.

79
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,830
Get a lead on something?

80
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:59,560
One of the COs from Fox River,
Brad Bellick,

81
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,230
got locked up last night

82
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:02,730
for the murder of another guard.

83
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,560
Wait, we're looking for COs now?

84
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,100
What about the escapees?

85
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:07,230
Scofield?

86
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:09,160
Burrows?
Nothing on them currently.

87
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,460
Also, Franklin's wife...

88
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,230
(phone rings)
was taken
into custody

89
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:14,460
in North Dakota.
His wife?

90
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,760
Line two.

91
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:20,760
This is Agent Mahone.

92
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:27,960
How long ago?

93
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:41,530
I'll make you a deal--
if you don't move a muscle,

94
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,800
I won't blow
your head off.

95
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:44,230
No one's gonna hurt you, Greg.

96
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:45,200
Where are we going,

97
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:46,700
Michael?
Can't keep driving.

98
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:47,630
We lost Steadman.

99
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:49,200
Sara's in
the wind.
Shh!

100
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:50,600
Turn it up.

101
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:51,900
(over radio):
...are armed and dangerous.

102
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:53,600
Burrows was sentenced to die

103
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:55,460
for the murder of
the president's brother.

104
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,130
The president could not
be reached

105
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,160
as she continues
to tour the Midwest.

106
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,700
REYNOLDS:
I want to thank all of you who

107
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:02,830
have supported me in the past,
and I appreciate

108
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:04,860
your continued support
in the upcoming year.

109
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,830
REPORTER:
Reynolds travels
to Colorado tomorrow

110
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:09,530
for a scheduled appearance
in Denver this evening.

111
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:12,230
Pull over.

112
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:13,900
What for?

113
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:18,200
Just pull over.

114
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:44,330
Want to drop
off this kid?

115
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,000
Later.

116
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:47,760
We should get rid
of Kellerman, too.

117
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,960
We don't need him.

118
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,330
Actually, we do.

119
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,200
We still have assets.

120
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,960
It's just a question
of how we use them.

Nurse.

125
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:44,330
Nurse!

126
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:47,500
You ain't no nurse.

127
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:49,360
You right about that.
(medical device beeping)

128
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,200
Oh, that's a pretty shiner
you got, Captain.

129
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:52,800
Must make you think
about all the times

130
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:55,530
you walked around here
in your fancy guard outfit,

131
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,960
turning a blind eye

132
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,030
to everything you saw
that was wrong.

133
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:02,300
"Who me?
Oh, I didn't see nothing."

134
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:04,360
How that blind eye feel now?

135
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,060
You son of a bitch.

136
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,200
Get used to it.

137
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:08,360
Hear old one-eyed jack's

138
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,160
gonna be getting screwed
in the socket.

139
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,430
Over my dead body.
No.

140
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:16,130
A dead man can't feel
a beat-down.

141
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,300
And you got a lot more
coming your way.

142
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:20,100
(door opens)

143
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:21,660
Come on now,
let's go.

144
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:37,600
(chatting indistinctly)

145
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,530
It'll take the feds a while
to figure that out.

146
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,260
What time is it?

147
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,660
A little after 9:00.

148
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:01,830
It's gonna be tight.

149
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:03,400
450 miles
in six hours.

150
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:05,400
What do you think?
Got to move now
if we're going to make it.

151
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:07,000
Eyes front.

152
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:11,560
Hey, look at this.

153
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,300
It's perfect. You ready?

154
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:20,700
Yep.

155
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:49,760
(clucking)

156
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,830
Puerto Rico.

(rustling)

160
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:24,400
Ugh!

161
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:26,800
Here, Larry, that's for you.

162
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:28,630
What about this?

163
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:30,160
This is too small.

164
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,660
Why didn't it float?

165
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:35,030
Why didn't it...?

166
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:36,230
I need more wood.

167
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,430
Wood floats.

168
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:40,730
This will work.

169
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:44,630
Hey, man.

170
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:54,600
We were just wondering
if you could buy us some beer.

171
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:56,060
Huh?

172
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:01,830
Yeah, sure.

173
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:04,860
Can I get some food
for my dog, too?

174
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,760
Do whatever thing
you got to do, man.

175
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,500
You can even keep
a beer for yourself.

176
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:12,360
Huh? Oh, no.

177
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,400
My dad used to drink.

178
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:37,860
You're going
to want to see this.

179
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:41,660
LANG:
We've shut down
every freeway

180
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,130
in central Montana.

181
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,960
So far, no sign of them.
Go wider.

182
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,830
Get troopers on and 90 and 94,
all the way

183
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:48,560
through Wyoming,
and call Whitefish.

184
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,560
Have him lock down the
Canadian border at 15.

185
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,860
REPORTER:
Recapping our top story
on the Fox River Eight, we will

186
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:56,400
now bring you exclusive footage
shot by

187
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:59,200
a cameraman who was kidnapped
by the escapees.

188
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:01,700
My name is Lincoln Burrows,
and I'm innocent.

189
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:05,260
I escaped
from Fox River Penitentiary

190
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:07,360
because I was sentenced to death
for a crime

191
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,160
I did not commit.

192
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,460
I did not murder
Terrence Steadman.

193
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:15,960
He committed suicide last night
in the Cutback Motel, 30 miles

194
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,130
outside of his home
in Blackfoot, Montana.

195
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,430
He killed himself
out of fear.

196
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:23,460
Fear of the people
who have been hiding him

197
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,860
for the past three years.

198
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:27,660
The same people
who want my brother dead.

199
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:32,230
They don't want you to know
who they are, but know this:

200
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:34,100
They've stolen billions
of dollars

201
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:36,500
and murdered dozens
of innocent people.

202
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:38,730
And yet they plaster
our faces on the news,

203
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,860
and tell you to be afraid.

204
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,860
They are a group
of multinationals

205
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,630
with corporate interests.

206
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:46,060
Together, they're known
as The Company.

207
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,500
MICHAEL:
They are working

208
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:49,030
with the highest levels
of government,

209
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:51,860
including the president
of the United States.

210
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:56,530
Damage control immediately,
before this hits page one.

211
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,330
It's already
airing, sir.

212
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,700
Start a wildfire in Florida!

213
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:01,060
Find a lost storage unit

214
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:03,260
full of Arabs!
I do not care!

215
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,930
As long as it's not
about Lincoln Burrows!

216
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:08,500
And they operate with impunity
Go!

217
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:13,160
under the cover
of the Secret Service,
少几句字幕，听一下，一起写到这里来

Dr. Sara Tancredi.

240
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:05,960
Do we know how long
the videotape lasts?

241
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,100
26 minutes, beginning to end.

242
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:09,700
It's all online.

243
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:12,730
I know I can't ask you
for another chance.

244
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,900
I can only hope that,
by now,

245
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:17,330
you've found
your safe haven.

246
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,460
Start a transcript.

247
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,830
I need every word.

248
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:24,400
...your commitment to help
others, and I put you in a place

249
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:26,900
that's every
doctor's nightmare.

250
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:28,960
I wish I could
do things differently...

251
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,260
Call Montana, have them
send an agent to talk

252
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:33,230
to the cameraman-- I want to
know what he saw, what he heard,

253
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:34,630
what they were wearing--
anything he can give us.

254
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:37,800
...people murdered
by government operatives.

255
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:40,560
One man, Special Agent
Alexander Mahone,

256
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,930
is responsible for multiple
deaths. He murdered

257
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,530
not only John Abruzzi
and David Apolskis,

258
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:49,260
but also the last fugitive
he was assigned to chase:

259
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,530
a man named Oscar Shales.

260
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,560
A man who escaped from prison
two years ago,

261
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,860
who remains one
of this country's most wanted

262
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:59,600
despite the fact
he will never be found.

263
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:01,230
The guy's nuts.

264
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:03,230
LINCOLN:
He'll do whatever it takes to
make the deaths look official--

265
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:05,530
like they happened
in the line of duty--

266
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,900
disappearances, accidents...

267
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:12,100
Hey, thank you.
Sure. Here you go.

268
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:19,760
What's the wood for?

269
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:23,130
I'm building a raft.

270
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:26,460
I need more wood if I'm going
to make it to Holland.

271
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,500
Holland?
Yeah.

272
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,860
Want to see it?

273
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:34,730
The raft?

274
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:39,400
||
GIRL:
You're going to try to get
from here to Holland in that?

275
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:41,530
Uh-huh.

276
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,260
Yeah, good luck,
Gilligan.

277
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:45,360
I'm going to
take a leak.

278
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:49,330
How are you going to
know where you're going?

279
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,230
Do you have, like,
a map or anything?

280
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:56,160
Yeah. I do.

281
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:59,430
It's-it's right...

282
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:01,230
Oh, it's right here.

283
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,100
That's your map?

284
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:10,800
Uh-huh.

285
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:15,300
Well, I really hope you make it.

286
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,460
You know, every morning,
I wake up 

287
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,960
and wonder what it would be like
to just disappear.

288
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:26,560
And you're just going to do it.

289
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:29,400
I think it's great.

290
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,630
(both laughing)

291
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:37,060
Okay. Well...

292
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:44,900
What happened to your arm?

293
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:57,430
My dad drinks, too.

294
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,430

295
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:02,960
What's going on?

296
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,230
Oh, nothing.
No, no. No, no, don't...

297
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:06,700
Let me go.

298
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:08,060
I just want to fix it.
Let me go.

299
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,060
No, I just want...
Stop!

300
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,630
Matt, will you
take me home, please?

301
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:15,800
No, I...

302
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,460
Freak.

303
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:49,830
All right, now, Brad,
how we doing?

304
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:51,400
I could be better.

305
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:53,460
Yeah, that's
a nasty contusion,

306
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:56,300
but it should go down
in about 24 hours.

307
00:18:56,330 --> 00:18:58,730
I got your paperwork here
for your transfer

308
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,230
back to Gen Pop.

309
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:02,000
Already?

310
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:04,530
Move 'em in, move 'em out;
you know the policy.

311
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,660
Katie...

312
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:07,860
Mm-hmm?

313
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:10,330
You look nice today.

314
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,700
You worked here over
tenyears, right?

315
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:20,360
Something like that.

316
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,700
That's a long time
we've been friends.

317
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:26,600
Brad, if you think I can pull
some strings to keep you

318
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:28,660
out of Gen Pop, I can't do that.

319
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:31,260
Please. Please,
You can't send me back there.

320
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:33,730
Do you want that responsibility,
knowing what they'll do to me?

321
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,600
Just listen, please.

322
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:36,760
One more night.

323
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,800
Just let me stay here tonight.

324
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:42,560
I know you
can do that.

325
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,160
And when you go home,

326
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:47,630
just leave that door open
for me.

327
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,600
(door closes)
REPORTER:
 <i>They hung a sheet</i>

328
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:57,130
behind their heads on the wall.

329
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,600
One of them--

330
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:01,030
the guy with the gun--
he found it

331
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:03,730
while Burrows and Scofield
were talking

332
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,430
about how far they had to go.

333
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:11,200
Uh... Scofield said something
about 450 miles in six hours.

334
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,960
450 miles to where?

335
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,530
I don't know.

336
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:22,600
MAHONE:
450 miles in six hours.

337
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:24,860
Any point on this circle

338
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:27,030
could be their final
destination.

339
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:30,660
75 miles per hour,
stopping for gas.

340
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:32,300
It's doable.
Yeah.

341
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:33,730
Where are they?

342
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:36,930
I'm not sure.

343
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,400
I still need more time.

344
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:41,230
This can't happen fast enough,
Mr. Mahone.

345
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:43,660
They've already
done irreparable damage.

346
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:46,830
Scofield made the video
in a storage facility somewhere

347
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:48,460
between Great Falls and Helena

348
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,300
not long after sunrise.

349
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:51,800
From there, the witness said

350
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:54,800
they had 450 miles
to get where they were going.

351
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:56,130
There's Seattle,

352
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,860
Portland, Salt Lake, Denver...

353
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,630
Denver?

354
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:01,500
Yes. What?

355
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:03,430
The president is speaking there
this afternoon.

356
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:05,900
3:00.

357
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:12,260
Six hours from when
they made the video.

358
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,230
 <i>by escaped convicts Lincoln</i>
 <i>Burrows and Michael Scofield</i>

359
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:21,860
 <i>was immediately dismissed</i>
 <i>by the Justice Department</i>

360
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:24,460
 <i>as entirely baseless, which</i>
 <i>brings us back to the story</i>

361
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,760
(over radio):
we'll be continuing
to follow throughout the day.

362
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:29,500
The terror threat
has been raised to Orange

363
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:31,860
as a storage unit rented
by several Arab Americans

364
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,430
was suddenly...
(radio shuts off)

365
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:36,430
They buried it, dumped it off
the front page and buried it.

366
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:37,600
It's what they do.

367
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:39,130
They can spin it
all they want,

368
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,430
it's out there now.

369
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:43,500
Give it time;
the tape is going to work.

370
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:45,860
This is a Hail Mary, man--
if we don't get to her...

371
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:47,060
Getting to her
is the easy part.

372
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,500
It's what we do after
that's the problem.

373
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:50,700
Which is why this has
to happen quickly.

374
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:53,060
Once anyone knows we have her,
the curtain comes down.

375
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,300
Well, I'll notify the
White House to cancel
the President's speech.

376
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:00,100
No. If there's any change
to her itinerary,

377
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:01,530
the brothers will know
something's up,

378
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,030
and they're gonna go
right back into hiding.

379
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:04,700
We've found them before, we can
certainly find them again...

380
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:07,600
These are not pets,
Agent Wheeler.

381
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:11,660
Yeah, thanks,
I'm pretty clear on that,

382
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,560
but if you're going to use
the commander-in-chief

383
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,930
as bait, it's certainly
not going to...

384
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,130
You have a problem with the way
that I do things?

385
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,000
Yeah.

386
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:24,700
And I'm not the only one.

387
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,360
Is that right?

388
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,130
Internal Affairs has asked me
to run all your moves

389
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,700
through them from here on out.

390
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,930
Then get a pen

391
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:50,800
and make sure
you get this word-for-word.

392
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:54,800
The president's day
does not change.

393
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:56,200
The only lead we have is that

394
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:57,730
we know where
these men are headed.

395
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,230
So we're gonna keep
quiet about this

396
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:02,660
and let 'em come.

397
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:06,330
Now, get out
of my office.

398
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:13,460
They're two of the most
recognizable faces in America.

399
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,600
How do they think
they were going to get

400
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:16,860
anywhere near the president?

401
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:20,100
Because it's not just
the two of them anymore.

402
00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:22,560
I'm gonna go take a closer look
at that video.

403
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:27,830
If I may, sir, the president...

404
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:31,400
Are you certain we should keep
her in the dark on this?

405
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:36,460
Because there is
a scenario where...

406
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,400
she could be useful.

407
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:45,000
It is... her ass
on the line, sir.

408
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:48,060
And I think we're all pretty
clear she's been known

409
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:52,060
to get her hands dirty
when that line gets too close.

410
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:55,560
We should
let her know

411
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,460
just how close it is.

412
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:01,100

(engine starts)

437
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:13,660
They did a good job
masking the room.

438
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:15,300
No reflections,
no flares.

439
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:16,900
Audio markers--
church bells,

440
00:26:16,930 --> 00:26:18,530
construction, traffic, anything?

441
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,760
The room tone tells us
they were in a large space--

442
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,800
about 100,000 cubic feet.

443
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:25,360
So the kid with the camera--
his story matches up?

444
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,760
We clocked
the quality of light

445
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,000
with the time of day,

446
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:29,530
and it pretty much fits
his wheres and whens.

447
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:31,430
All right, content.

448
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:34,330
The usual tells--
eyes, hands, feet.

449
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,000
Burrows, we were able
to baseline him

450
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:37,330
off the footage
from his trial,

451
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,060
so we got even more
clarity there.

452
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:41,460
I escaped from
from Fox River Penitentiary

453
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:44,460
because I was sentenced to death
for a crime I did not commit.

454
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:47,260
I did not murder
Terrence Steadman.

455
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:48,230
Okay, there.

456
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:50,260
The eyes.

457
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,500
See it?

458
00:26:51,530 --> 00:26:53,300
Yeah, slight shift
to the left, then up.

459
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:56,230
Yeah, blink rate's up here
versus the pattern.

460
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:58,760
LINCOLN:
He committed suicide last night
in the Cutback Motel

461
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:02,660
30 miles outside from this home
in Blackfoot, Montana.

462
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:05,330
He's lying.

463
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,100
Seems so.

464
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:09,930
(tape squeaking as it rewinds)

465
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:12,030
Okay, here,
Burrows,

466
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:13,660
arms folded.

467
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:15,800
He's protecting himself.

468
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:17,000
We'll do whatever
it takes...

469
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:18,560
Not a lot of confidence
in these words.

470
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,500
...like they happen
in the line of duty.

471
00:27:20,530 --> 00:27:22,860
Okay, that means something
other than what he's saying.

472
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:24,030
(computer keys tapping)

473
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:25,200
Like our father
Aldo Burrows...

474
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:28,260
Posture, shoulders in,
for emphasis.

475
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:29,800
Really wants your
attention here.

476
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:32,200
Our attorney,
Veronica Donovan...

477
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:33,900
I was on the phone...
Right there.

478
00:27:33,930 --> 00:27:35,530
...when they shot her
like an animal.
Adam's apple.

479
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,630
Zoom in, zoom in.

480
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:39,130
We made this tape
to let the world know...

481
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,330
That's a lie.

482
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,860
Yeah.

483
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:43,160
His behavior
is textbook.

484
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,360
If there's anything in here

485
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,630
about what they plan on
doing in Denver,

486
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:47,430
they're gonna tell us.

487
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:53,730
If you say it that way,
it plays too earnest.

488
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,530
'Course it will--
it's the truth.

489
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,530
Okay, but the truth sends them
home to the wife and kids.

490
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:58,930
Lies will keep them busy.

491
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,230
I'm not telling a lie
to the whole country.

492
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:03,330
It's our one chance
to say it out...

493
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,630
Yeah, say whatever the hell
you want--

494
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:06,530
tell them
you're the Green Lantern--

495
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,460
but I know
how they break down these tapes.

496
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:09,600
I've done it.

497
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:12,200
Every detail matters.

498
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:14,200
Bin Laden crosses his legs--
right over left--

499
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:16,700
tells us something completely
different than left over right.

500
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:18,160
It's not the same message.

501
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,960
To them, it is.

502
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,560
If you want this
plan to work,
whatever you say

503
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,600
with your mouths,
you need to be saying

504
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:26,630
something different with
your bodies and your eyes.

505
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:29,260
Slightly up and to the left.

506
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:32,930
Yes.

507
00:28:32,930 --> 00:28:33,930

508
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,230
Much blame has been placed
on another innocent person...

509
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:37,760
LANG:
President's motorcade
is rolling in.

510
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,430
So far no sign of the brothers.

511
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:40,400
Right there. Right there.

512
00:28:40,430 --> 00:28:41,600
What's Scofield doing
with his hand?

513
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:43,160
(computer keys tapping)

514
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,300
We've been throwing them
a bunch of fast balls.

515
00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:46,900
What do you say
we mix it up a little?

516
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:48,230
Like what?

517
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:50,830
(keys tapping)
We think it's Morse code.

518
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:52,200
For what?

519
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:56,000
Right now we've got a phrase,
"The water is warm."

520
00:28:56,030 --> 00:28:57,960
Any idea
what that might mean?

521
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,330
What the hell does that mean?

522
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,900
Nothing.

523
00:29:00,930 --> 00:29:03,300
But it'll take the Feds a while
to figure that out.

524
00:29:03,330 --> 00:29:06,160
TECHIE:
We have teams checking
the surrounding counties

525
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,260
for the water temps.
It might be a message

526
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:09,960
to an accomplice.

527
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,600
(tape rewinding)

528
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:13,400
The North Platte river
runs through the city.

529
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:14,400
Maybe they're trying to use...

530
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:15,860
It doesn't mean anything.

531
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,460
He's traveling with
an ex-Secret Service guy.

532
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,300
I'm guessing they're
spoon-feeding us every lead

533
00:29:19,330 --> 00:29:20,460
they want us to follow.

534
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,900
So all this is
just a distraction

535
00:29:21,930 --> 00:29:23,330
while they go after
the president?

536
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,600
They had to know
the tape would be discredited.

537
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:27,960
They had to know
that we'd talk to the cameraman.

538
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:30,360
Much blame has been placed

539
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:35,200
on another innocent person,
Dr. Sara Tancredi.

540
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,830
Sara, if you're listening,

541
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:41,160
I know I can't ask you
for another chance.

542
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,930
I only hope by now
you've found your safe haven.

543
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,600
I took advantage of you,

544
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:48,760
of your commitment
to help others

545
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:52,060
and put your in a place
that's every doctor's nightmare.

546
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:53,160
(tape rewinds)

547
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,930
Sara, if you're listening,

548
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,530
I know I can't ask you
for another chance.

549
00:29:56,560 --> 00:30:00,460
I only hope by now
you've found your safe haven.

550
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:02,760
I took advantage of you,

551
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,260
of your commitment
to help others

552
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:07,600
and put your in a place
that's every doctor's nightmare.

553
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:08,630
(tape rewinds)

554
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:09,960
...of your commitment
to help others

555
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,060
and put you in a place

556
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:13,830
that's every doctor's nightmare.

557
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:15,830
I've considered many ways
to apologize,

558
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:17,730
but I must arrive at one.

559
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,960
There's more
of the same here.

560
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,600
Uh, body language,
his tells...

561
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:24,530
If you ask me, it doesn't look
like he means this at all.

562
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:26,300
I don't care what it looks like.
Play it again.

563
00:30:26,330 --> 00:30:28,830
I don't see...
Play it again.

564
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:31,160
(keys tapping, tape rewinds)

565
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,130
I only hope by now
you've found your safe haven.

566
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:36,530
I took advantage of you,

567
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,260
of your commitment
to help others

568
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:41,030
and put you in a place
that's every doctor's nightmare.

569
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:42,430
His voice-- would you say

570
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:44,130
he sounds sincere
when he's talking to her

571
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,200
as opposed to when he's
talking about their crimes?

572
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:47,660
I... I guess
you could say that.

573
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:50,060
I did say that.
Would you say that?

574
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,430
I wish I could do
this differently,

575
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:53,230
but it's too late
for that now.
Yeah.

576
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:56,060
It's too late for you
and for others.

577
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,400
People murdered
by government operatives...

578
00:30:57,430 --> 00:30:58,800
This isn't
about Terrence Steadman,

579
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:00,100
and it's not about
their innocence.

580
00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:02,330
What do you mean?
They're not going

581
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,800
after the president;
they're going after the doctor.

582
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:06,830
I want everything
we've got on Sara Tancredi--

583
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:08,800
friends, families, pen-pals.

584
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:10,400
If anybody so much as wrote her
a thank-you note,

585
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:12,530
I want to know where the hell
they arenow!

Sara Tancredi.

601
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:13,460
Dad dead, mom dead.

602
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,460
E-mail account shows
a minimal list of contacts

603
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:17,700
with very little activity.

604
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:20,030
Credit cards used
mostly for groceries,

605
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:22,600
sporadic clothing
shopping and, uh,

606
00:33:22,630 --> 00:33:24,300
the purchase
of single movie tickets.

607
00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:27,900
And ob-gyn records tell us she's
had very little in the way

608
00:33:27,930 --> 00:33:29,000
of sexual relationships
recently.

609
00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:30,100
To tell you the truth,

610
00:33:30,130 --> 00:33:32,730
I would say the bulk
of her life was her work.

611
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:49,730
Excuse me, sir,
where are you going?

612
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:12,300
Apparently,
we took out a janitor.

613
00:34:13,730 --> 00:34:15,500
When it all comes down,
all of this will get cleared up.

614
00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:17,400
Well, it ain't coming down
if we don't get Sara.

615
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:19,060
She'll be here.

616
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:23,230
I want to speak
to my brother.

617
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:27,160
We got to start thinking

618
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,830
about what to do
if she doesn't show.

619
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:31,600
Or if she does.

620
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:36,000
What if the only reason
this guy's helping us

621
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:37,930
is to get whatever
information Sara has?

622
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:45,130
What if this is
just one giant setup?

623
00:34:45,130 --> 00:34:46,130

624
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,360
Well, good night.

625
00:35:10,330 --> 00:35:13,200
It's about time you come home.

626
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:17,560
Been out with
that Feytek boy again?

627
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,200
Sasha.

628
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:21,260
You may

629
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:22,730
look like me...

630
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:26,130
but you take after your mom
when it comes to boys,

631
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,700
now, don't you?

632
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:29,860
Hopefully,
with a little better taste.

633
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:36,160
Damn it, girl, you are gonna
show me some respect.

634
00:35:40,330 --> 00:35:42,660
(grunts)

635
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:46,530
(blows landing)

636
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:52,030
MAHONE:
 <i>I know Sara didn't have</i>
 <i>many friends.</i>

637
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:53,730
She's sort of a loner.

638
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,400
But you were her friend.

639
00:35:55,430 --> 00:35:58,130
I like to think so, yes.

640
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,660
And you have no idea
where she is now?

641
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:01,960
No.

642
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,200
This is a transcript of
the Scofield-Burrows videotape.

643
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:08,730
I highlighted the part where
he talks directly to Sara.

644
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:11,900
Mean anything to you?

645
00:36:11,930 --> 00:36:14,000
No.

646
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:16,660
You have no idea where
she might meet him, if...

647
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:17,700
that's his plan?

648
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:20,130
(sighs):
No.

649
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,930
(bell rings)

650
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:24,630
Is Brad Bellick still here
in the infirmary?

651
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:26,430
Yeah. Why?

652
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:29,130
You must be loving this.

653
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:30,260
(chuckles softly)

654
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:32,800
I didn't drive all this way
to gloat.

655
00:36:32,830 --> 00:36:35,100
Well, then what the hell
you come here for?

656
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:42,030
(sighs)
First, I really...
got to tip my cap to you.

657
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:44,030
You've managed
to draw a bead on the convicts

658
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:45,260
more often than my own staff.

659
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:46,860
Well, thanks for the
"attaboy," but...

660
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:48,860
as you can see,
the correctional system

661
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:50,860
doesn't share your gratitude.

662
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:54,460
I won't take much of your time,
but I do have a few questions.

663
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:56,200
About...?
Sara Tancredi.

664
00:36:56,230 --> 00:36:57,700
She listed you
as a reference

665
00:36:57,730 --> 00:36:59,430
on her job application
to work here.

666
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:00,600
You know her well?

667
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:06,500
I'd know her a lot better if you
can get my ass moved to Ad Seg.

668
00:37:06,530 --> 00:37:08,700
(chuckles softly)
I have no influence

669
00:37:08,730 --> 00:37:11,400
with the D.O.C.--
you know that.

670
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:14,860
If you want my help, you do.

671
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:18,360
I'll talk to the warden
and see what I can do--

672
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,500
right after you give me
some answers.

673
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:23,960
Scofield likes to communicate
with Sara via coded message.

674
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:28,160
Do you recognize anything here?

675
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:31,230
Anything that he may be
trying to tell her?
No.

676
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:33,030
I mean, he's saying
he's sorry.

677
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:37,860
Not that that's gonna do any
good with Dr. Cold Shoulder.

678
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:39,630
But...

679
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:42,500
What?

680
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:46,460
Ad Seg.

681
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,960
(sighs)

682
00:37:50,930 --> 00:37:52,730
Yeah.

683
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:55,500
All right, you see here,

684
00:37:55,530 --> 00:37:57,400
where it says this stuff
about "another chance."

685
00:37:57,430 --> 00:37:59,130
"Safe haven."

686
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:01,230
That's out of the big book.

687
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:02,560
What big book?

688
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:04,160
Alcoholics Anonymous.

689
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,360
Sara's in recovery.

690
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,660
Yeah, I'm aware of that.
Those are the names

691
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:11,030
of some of the chapters
in the book they use in AA.

692
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:13,930
Do you have a copy of
the Alcoholics Anonymous book?

693
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:18,230
MICHAEL:
 <i>Sara, if you're listening,</i>

694
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:21,400
 <i>I know I can't ask you</i>
 <i>for another chance.</i>

695
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:30,630
 <i>I can only hope by now</i>
 <i>you've found your safe haven.</i>

696
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:34,560
 <i>I took advantage of you,</i>
 <i>your commitment to help others</i>

697
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:37,360
 <i>and put you in a place that's</i>
 <i>every doctor's nightmare.</i>

698
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:45,530
 <i>I've considered many ways</i>
 <i>to apologize,</i>

699
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:47,730
 <i>but I must arrive at one.</i>

700
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:55,630
It's getting late.
I know.

701
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:57,160
She's not here.

702
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,300
I know that, too.

703
00:38:59,330 --> 00:39:02,730
There is a chance
she didn't get the message.

704
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,760
Or maybe she's just sick
of all this.

705
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,730
The girl bailed on you
back in Gila.

706
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:10,030
What makes you think she's
gonna come running back now?

707
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:12,730
The same thing
that's been keeping us going

708
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:15,830
for the last three months:
faith.

709
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:19,530
Yeah, well... reality's
kicking faith's ass, man.

710
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:21,760
Look...
Wait, wait.

711
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,660
Wait? Man,
we can't wait anymore.

712
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:26,600
(over P.A. system):
Once again, Michael Crane,
Listen, listen.

713
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:28,360
please report to the front desk.

714
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,660
You have a telephone call.

715
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:33,100
Michael Crane to the front desk.

716
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,360
Yeah. Sara Tancredi.

717
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:38,030
That's right.
She might be with them now.

718
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:39,860
Just... Yes!
Just call the local police

719
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:42,660
in Akron and tell them
to get everyone they have

720
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:44,400
over to St. Thomas Hospital now.

721
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:48,260
Um...

722
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:51,860
Michael Crane. I think
you have a call for me.

723
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:57,760
Thank you.

724
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:01,630
This is Mr. Crane.

725
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:04,930
It sounded better
than "Origami."

726
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:07,800
Even if you got the message,
I wasn't sure you'd respond.

727
00:40:07,830 --> 00:40:09,530
I-I couldn't get to you in time.

728
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:11,760
This is the only thing
I could think of.

729
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:17,500
I swore I'd leave you alone,
but I had to contact you.

730
00:40:17,530 --> 00:40:20,230
Because I have something?

731
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:22,300
How'd you know?

732
00:40:22,330 --> 00:40:26,600
Michael, back in Gila
I was coming back to you.

733
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:31,000
Somebody... grabbed me,
and they, um,

734
00:40:31,030 --> 00:40:33,900
they told me that my father
had given me something.

735
00:40:33,930 --> 00:40:35,860
Did someone hurt you?

736
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:37,860
I-I got away.

737
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:40,430
Uh...

738
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:42,030
(sighs)

739
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:44,660
Michael,
I want for this to be over.

740
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:48,800
That makes two of us.

741
00:40:48,830 --> 00:40:52,360
Do you think that's possible?

742
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,230
With your help, yes.

743
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:56,460
It's just a question of looking

744
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:58,230
at whatever it is
your father gave you.

745
00:40:58,260 --> 00:41:00,160
It's just...

746
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:03,530
It's just a key.

747
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:06,600
Well, we'll figure it out.

748
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:09,330
Together.

749
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,830
I like the sound of that.

750
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:19,230
Me, too.

751
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:21,330
(phone ringing)

752
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:38,030
REYNOLDS:
Hello, Paul.

753
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:42,060
Madam President,
it's been a while.

754
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:43,330
I know.

755
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:45,700
I'm calling to apologize.

756
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,900
Okay.

757
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:53,360
It all just got away from me,
and I ended up hurting

758
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:56,130
the one person
who's always been at my side.

759
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:58,300
I want you to come home, Paul.

760
00:41:58,330 --> 00:41:59,730
We can fix this.

761
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,060
Together.

762
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:03,860
But not with those brothers
running around the country

763
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:07,560
tearing down the very office
you helped me build.

764
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:11,060
Caroline...

765
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:13,800
Bring them in, Paul,
and everything can go back

766
00:42:13,830 --> 00:42:15,460
to the way it was.

767
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:18,600
That is what you want, isn't it?

768
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:23,130
I have to go now.

769
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:25,300
I'll see you soon.

770
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:35,230
Did you talk to Sara?

771
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:38,630
In a few days,
this should all be over,

772
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:41,300
one way or the other.

773
00:42:43,330 --> 00:42:44,800
KELLERMAN:
Absolutely.

774
00:42:44,830 --> 00:43:44,860


775
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
