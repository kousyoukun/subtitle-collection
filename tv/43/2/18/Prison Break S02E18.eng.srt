1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:01,930
prison break...

2
00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:05,090
it will work out.
You have my word.Be careful.

3
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:07,620
Jane's gonna look after you.
Hey.

4
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,930
I have a sister,I haven't talked to in 15 years.
You think she's better off for it?

5
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:14,100
Bruce?

6
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:17,220
I know we said not to use this number,but I just needed to know you were okay.

7
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:18,610
It was you.

8
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:20,510
What are you talking about,sara?

9
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:25,980
- I got three words for you.
- Yeah?

10
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:27,920
We gotta run.

11
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,590
I want to turn myself in.
But I got one condition.

12
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:34,940
Your wife was released an hour ago.
She'll be here soon.

13
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:36,900
Just hold up your end of the deal.

14
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:38,320
I'll get you scofield.

15
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:39,740
An nsa analyst

16
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:41,310
sympathetic to our cause got

17
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:43,750
his hands on a phone conversation the president had

18
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:47,500
with terrence steadman two weeks after after you supposedly killed him.

19
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:50,240
24 hours later,tancredi is dead,

20
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:55,080
the analyst is missing,and the white house echelon tapes have been deleted from the mainframe.

21
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:57,680
There's a tape,gives us everything we need.

22
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,700
Linc will be set free if we find it.

23
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:01,600
You have something here.

24
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,210
There are gonna be a lot of people who wish you didn't,but you do.

25
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:06,020
You think it's a conversation?

26
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:09,090
One they don't want us to hear.

27
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,440
You ready?

28
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:13,690
Let's do it.

29
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:44,830
oh,my god.

30
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:48,220
Yeah.

31
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:52,550
Patoshik...

32
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,270
dead.

33
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:59,060
Franklin,incarcerated and assisting with the capture of scofield and burrows.

34
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:00,820
What exactly is the protocol with that?

35
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,390
I'll handle that.

36
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,420
We're at the halfway mark,people.

37
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:06,680
Burrows,scofield...

38
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:09,580
bagwell,sucre--
they're still out there.

39
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:11,960
Now,I heard a report came in from...

40
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,870
mexico.

41
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:16,220
Fernando sucre was almost apprehended at the airport in ixtapa.

42
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:26,190
Excuse me.

43
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:30,310
Office,please.

44
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,740
What the hell are you doing here?

45
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:36,610
I came for my damn money.

46
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:39,520
- Your what?
- The patoshik reward money.

47
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:43,840
See,how a reward works is,someone gets rewarded the money,

48
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,690
and since I'm the one who bloodhounded haywire,the money gets rewarded to me.

49
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:49,220
You come to my office...

50
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:53,260
if you'd returned any of my calls,I wouldn't have had to.
We had a deal.

51
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:56,990
The deal was that you stay under the radar.
Is this under the radar,brad?

52
00:02:56,990 --> 00:03:00,740
No,this is an office full of federal agents,who now have all seen your face.

53
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:02,680
Yeah,I don't care what they see.

54
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:07,670
Hell,if you don't pay up,I'll go out there and drop trou.

55
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:25,620
patoshik died,you stupid son of a bitch.

56
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:28,710
There's paperwork involved.
Of course you're going to get the money.

57
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,270
But you're gonna have to be patient.

58
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:33,410
And if you ever...

59
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:36,770
come in my office again,

60
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,680
you'll not only never see the cash,you'll never see another sunrise.

61
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,600
now,are we gonna keep crying about money you've already got coming to you?

62
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:57,110
Or do you want to make some more?

63
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,410
I'm listening.

64
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,720
Ever been to mexico?

65
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:11,880
We give this thing to the press,the government's gonna discredit it,just like they did with the tape we madE.

66
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,610
Okay.

67
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:16,640
So what do we do with it?

68
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:20,090
Dad said there are still people in the administration that he was working with.

69
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:24,810
If we give the tape to them,they'll finally have the smoking gun they need to bring caroline reynolds down.

70
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,660
But they'll release the tape...

71
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:28,470
not us.

72
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:31,280
And how can she discredit her own appointees?
Sure.

73
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,470
We're gonna give the only thing that can exonerate me to someone who works for the government?

74
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:39,110
The same government that set me up?

75
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:42,860
We'll have to find someone we can trust,someone honest.

76
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:46,800
Jane phillips.
She'll know someone that can help us.

77
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,570
She worked with dad; she's watching lj.
I trust her,michael.

78
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,490
She'll do it; she'll find someone.

79
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:57,220
Well,I hope you're right.

80
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:01,870
Because this is our last shot.

81
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:07,260
This'll do you right.
She's a remington 700.

82
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,550
She a clean shot?

83
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:12,270
Like a good woman,she does not stray.

84
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:15,700
Varmint,stainless- steel fluted barrel,heavyweight caliber,

85
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:18,460
175-grain hollow point.

86
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,880
- I'll take the case,too.
- She's a throw-in.

87
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,610
Serial numbers have been cleaned.

88
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:33,670
Chamber's been scraped to throw off ballistics,just in case you're not,

89
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:36,720
you know,shooting at tin cans.

90
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:40,790
No,I'm hunting bigger game than that.

91
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,490
hey,hey,hey,hey!

92

<font color="#ffff00">Prison Break
Season 02 Episode 18</font>

95
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:21,360
Radio silence.

96
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,710
Look,I just don't know how often he checks this thing,all right?

97
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:28,910
Well,it seems not that often,considering you've posted three messages.

98
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,640
I'm starting to wonder why I need you at all.

99
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:34,800
To get scofield.
What?What are we doing here?

100
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:38,830
Well,I can type,and scofield can't see who's sending him the messages.

101
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:42,790
Well,you know what,he's gonna see whatever little rent-a-fed cops that you guys have set up,

102
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:44,710
whatever place you guys are gonna set up to meet him.

103
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:47,030
Now,you and i both know how smart this kid is,right?

104
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:49,770
Clearly smarter than you,considering you're the one who's wearing bright orange.

105
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:51,880
- Oh,yeah?
- Yeah.

106
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:57,590
Fish is not gonna peek his little white ass out from any rock that he's hiding
unless he sees a familiar face.

107
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:59,300
A famili...
and that's your face,right?

108
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:02,280
- Yeah,you're damn straight it is,so don't pretend you said sucre...
- you said like you don't need me.

109
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:06,320
- You overheard him telling sucre about a web site!
- Don't pretend like you don't need me.

110
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,330
- You overheard something?
- Look,he's a boy scout,he...

111
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:10,310
I don't see...
he helps,okay?!

112
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:13,430
If you have a little bit of patience,he will hit me back!

113
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:15,160
I'm the only one in the world right now helping your family.

114
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,880
- I help my family,okay?
- So do I.

115
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,480
I'm the one that got kacee released,I'm the one that gets dede medical care,

116
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:23,160
I'm the one that allows you to visit them,and I'm the one that can take it away.

117
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,660
Well,you know what,it looks like we both need each other,doesn't it?

118
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:27,310
Do we?

119
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:30,840
So I am gonna hold up my end of the bargain,and guess what?

120
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,780
You hold up yours.

121
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:36,220
Now,get off my back.

122
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:41,110
You can get what you want.
Just give me what I want.

123
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:43,710
Give me scofield.

124
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:46,330
PULLMAN,WASHINGTON

125
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:51,010
- hello?
- Hey,buddy.

126
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:52,550
Dad?

127
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:55,380
Yeah,it's me.
How you holding up?

128
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:57,670
Okay.
How about you?

129
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:59,900
Good.
Good.

130
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,340
I,uh...

131
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:02,840
i miss you.

132
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:05,030
Yeah,me,too.

133
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:07,300
I didn't know you had jane's number.

134
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:10,990
Yeah,well,uh,we exchanged numbers when you guys split.

135
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:13,150
You never called.

136
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:14,530
No.
Yeah...

137
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:17,520
I'm sorry,it's been,uh,it's been dangerous.

138
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,980
- You know? A little dangerous.
- It's-it's okay.

139
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:23,800
Lj,uh,listen,I know I've said this before,

140
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:27,420
but I think we've found something that's finally gonna put this stuff behind us.

141
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:31,040
When it's good,when it's safe,I'm going to come and get you.

142
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:32,580
You,me,your uncle...

143
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:34,470
- daD.
- Yeah?

144
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,380
I want you to end this more than anything,

145
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:41,430
but...
I'm in school again.

146
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:44,950
Under a fake name,but it's still school,you know?

147
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:50,160
I mean,it's not the same,but it's the closest thing to a home I've had in a long time.

148
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:52,570
I...
I guess...

149
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,030
I guess I'm just saying that...

150
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,680
for now,for-for a while...

151
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:03,790
I just want to stay in one place,have something normal.

152
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:07,330
Yeah,yeah,I...

153
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:09,750
I get it.
I,uh...

154
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:12,380
I need to speak with jane.

155
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:14,160
Okay.

156
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,840
I love you,dad.

157
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:20,600
I love you,too,son.

158
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:29,060
birmingham,alabama

159
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:31,030
Mr. Webster.

160
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,750
Sorry to keep you waiting.

161
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,690
Ah,it's no problem,doc.

162
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:38,930
I just,uh,wanted to tell you how much I appreciate you seeing me on such short notice.

163
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,150
That's what I'm here for.

164
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:43,130
Good.

165
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:46,840
'Cause I got a few things I need to get off my chest.

166
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:49,360
See you,jane.

167
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:00,890
Cooper green?

168
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,900
Former deputy attorney general.

169
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:08,980
Splits his time between dc,chicago and new york,jane says he's been an ally of dad's forever.

170
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:11,490
We find him,we got a shot.

171
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:17,710
How is lj?

172
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:21,260
He's doing all right.

173
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:27,970
Cooper green's office.

174
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:30,820
I'm sorry,Mr. Green isn't available at this time.

175
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:31,810
Please,this is very important.

176
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:36,010
Just tell him I have some information regarding the sons of aldo burrows.

177
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,450
- Aldo burrows?
- Yes.

178
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:40,800
He and Mr. Green used to work together.

179
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,760
Please hold.
I'll try to reach him.

180
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,710
She's tracking him down.

181
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:53,700
- HellO.
- Mr. Green,this is michael scofield.

182
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:56,610
- Do you know who I am?
- Of course. I knew your father.

183
00:10:56,610 --> 00:11:00,710
And I know what happened to him.I'm sorry.
He was a good man trying to do good things.

184
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:02,760
Well,so are we.

185
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,230
We have something.

186
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:06,490
- The tape.
- You've heard of it.

187
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:09,190
Well,I know a lot of people have been looking for it.

188
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:10,730
What's on the tape?

189
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:15,490
If you want to find out,there's a bronze statue of a mammoth
at the southwest corner of ebert park.

190
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:18,160
I need you there in an hour.
Do you have a blue suit?

191
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,320
- Yes.
- Wear it,and a red tie.

192
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:23,130
That way,we'll know who you are.

193
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:26,490
ready?

194
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:28,630
Yeah.

195
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:34,920
Good luck.

196
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:47,760
This will work.

197
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,330
You think?

198
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,920
Hello,sara.

199
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:34,130
I figured you'd show up eventually.

200
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:37,050
You look good,bruce.

201
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:41,170
You've done well for yourself at my father's expense.

202
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:44,190
I had nothing to do with your fath.
Your father was murdered.

203
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:47,370
By you.
And then you tried to have me killed.Don'T...

204
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:49,040
how can you say that?

205
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,380
My line was tapped,and they heard you tell me that you were at that pay phone.

206
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:54,300
Sara,I've known your family my entire life.

207
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,590
Which makes your betrayal disgusting.

208
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:02,060
For what it's worth,I've been tortured already.
It didn't work.

209
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:03,940
I shouldn't have to defend myself to you,sara.

210
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:07,790
If you can't trust me,then all I can do is just wish you luck.

211
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,240
Go.

212
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:34,840
look,before you get started,
I'm gonna save you some time here,jefe.

213
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:39,010
I played rat for you once,and that was it.
I got protection now.

214
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:42,070
I let the top bangers in here cherry pick the laundry--

215
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:46,650
clean sheets,new shorts--
and for that,I'm untouchable.

216
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:50,220
So threaten all you want,homes.

217
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,360
Yo,man,what are you going to do?

218
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:01,750
You don't look like you play too much tennis,manche.

219
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:04,650
This is probably more youspeed.

220
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:08,770
Entertainment center.
Wide-screen plasma.

221
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:11,950
Pinball.

222
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:13,290
Poker table.

223
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:14,900
Yo,man,what the hell is this?

224
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:16,710
Your future.

225
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:20,260
At kankakee minimum security correctional center,

226
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:23,180
where the only thing softer that the pillows are the guards.

227
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:26,420
I didn't come here to threaten.

228
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:30,590
I mean,why whip the mule when he'll work even harder for a sugar cube?

229
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:36,070
The same connections that got this fox out of the river so quick,

230
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:38,330
well,I can use them for you,too.

231
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:44,070
All I need to know is where down in mexico your cousin sucre is headed.

232
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:50,840
RIO JUAREZ,MEXICO

233
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,690
xxxxxxXX

234
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:07,100
look,mami,look!

235
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,330
I told you.
Llamas!

236
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:11,410
I think those are alpacas.

237
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:13,630
That's what I said,a pack-a llamas.

238
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:16,800
fernando!
Fernando!

239
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:18,280
Auntie?

240
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,500
My sister's baby boy.

241
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:23,780
It's so good to see you.

242
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:26,040
This is my Maricruz...

243
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:31,600
...and this is our child.

244
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:36,340
We will be safe here?

245
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:40,050
Yes.This is your home now.

246
00:15:54,120 --> 00:16:00,140
what I'm trying to tell you,
doc,is I just feel like I've been a penny on the train tracks my entire life.

247
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:06,380
And that 'ole union pacific just keeps on coming,every day,back and forth,

248
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:10,720
just running me down,running me over,but I will not flatten.

249
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,650
I will not flatten.

250
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:15,380
You know the nice thing about pennies,Mr. Webster?

251
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:18,350
They have dates on them.
And you can pick the date.

252
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:21,590
Your own date.
Today's date.

253
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:24,080
You can get a fresh start.

254
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,900
You can be a brand-new shiny penny.

255
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:34,000
you know,I got to be honest with you,c; I had no intention of--
whatsoever--

256
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:39,840
talking to you once I got inside your office today,but I have to admit,I find therapy...

257
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:45,730
well,it's therapeutic.

258
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,140
I don't follow.

259
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:50,870
If you didn't plan on talking today,why did you come in?

260
00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:02,030
Well,I saw the ad on the back of the bus stop today.

261
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:06,350
And,uh...

262
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:09,850
though it wasn't exactly like looking in the mirror,

263
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:16,250
you can't deny that there's a certain commonality in our visages.

264
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:22,540
I guess we do look a little bit alike...

265
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:27,310
but I don't understand.

266
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:36,720
What the hell you think you're doing?

267
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:06,320
hello.

268
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,080
- Mr. Green?
- Yes.

269
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:10,850
This is lincoln burrows.

270
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:12,980
Do exactly what I say.

271
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:16,310
Your suit jacket.
Toss it in the trash behind you.

272
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:17,930
Excuse me?

273
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:19,630
Do it.

274
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:36,700
All right.
I just threw my $2,000 zegna suit jacket in the garbage.

275
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:38,270
Good.

276
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:42,260
There's a phone on the other side of the park.
Be there in four minutes.

277
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:43,610
Four...?

278
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:06,840
make it quick.
This cell is running out of juice.

279
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:08,690
You were right.

280
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,130
- He's being tailed?
- Yeah.

281
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,400
On it.

282
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:24,300
- yeah?
- I'm looking for a guy in a suit.

283
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:26,630
Lots of guys with suits.

284
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:28,380
It's me.

285
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:30,110
See the fountain?

286
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,380
How could I not?

287
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:36,070
Get in.

288
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:08,050
They want to drown the mics in case we bugged him.

289
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,510
Hey,mister.

290
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:18,240
This is for you.

291
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,310
- I'm not interested.
- I'm not selling it--

292
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:24,590
some dude gave me 20 bucks to give it to the first wet guy I see.

293
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:26,270
Here.

294
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:30,650
See the building across from you?

295
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:31,820
Yeah.

296
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:33,090
Go inside.

297
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:35,470
Look,this is getting ridiculous.
I've done everything you've asked.

298
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:36,490
If you want to meet me...

299
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:39,140
we've been burned way too many times,Mr. Green.

300
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:41,570
We need to make sure that this thing goes down right.

301
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:44,490
Go inside,and keep the phone to your ear.

302
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:57,710
- yeah.
- Where are we?

303
00:20:57,710 --> 00:21:01,760
He's gone inside the beck museum,but we've got men out back.
He's not going anywhere.

304
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:08,540
yeah?

305
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:11,390
Get to ebert park.
I have men on scofield and burrows.

306
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,510
Ebert park?

307
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:16,140
Scofield set a meet with a target we're surveilling.

308
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:18,550
What the hell is scofield doing in chicago?

309
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:21,300
You're asking why the deer walked into your crosshairs?

310
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,280
Just take the shot,mahone.

311
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,200
I'm on it.
I'm on it.

312
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,000
And alex.

313
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,810
Franklin.

314
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:31,510
Using franklin to help me find scofield.

315
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:32,940
Yeah.

316
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:35,170
We don't need him for that anymore.

317
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:38,280
What I do need is a death with no questions.

318
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:52,690
hey,look,it's nothing yet,man,but I'm sure he'll hit me real soon,okay?

319
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,530
you know,if I were in your situation...

320
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:07,950
everything you've done,every decision you've made...

321
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:11,950
I'd have done the same thing.

322
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:16,670
You're a good man,good father.

323
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:20,330
There's,uh...
been a change of plans.

324
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:25,320
It looks like I'm not gonna ne your help after all.

325
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:30,860
so you found scofield.

326
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:35,000
My colleagues are getting pretty close,yeah.

327
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:38,080
- So...
- so i guess you can set me free,then.

328
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:44,430
Of course not.

329
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:55,030
- you and me,we had a deal,right?
- Right.

330
00:22:56,950 --> 00:23:00,690
I get your wife released,take care of your daughter's health,

331
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:04,000
you get me scofield.

332
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:08,120
But you,you're getting him yourself.
You just said that.

333
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,360
I know.I know.
I just want you to know...

334
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:16,930
that,uh,I'm going to keep my promise to you

335
00:23:17,610 --> 00:23:19,340
and I'm going to help your family.

336
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,930
But I'm gonna need hour help,too,

337
00:23:22,930 --> 00:23:25,870
and this is something that you're not gonna want to do and I don't want you to do this,

338
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:29,280
but i need you to do this and if you don't,I will have kacee arrested again,

339
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:35,170
and I will have dede's medical care stopped,and I will hate myself,and it will make me sick,but I swear to god...

340
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:41,190
I will ruin their lives--
don't make me.

341
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:44,390
What the hell are you saying to me?

342
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:49,630
Later today,you'll get a package in your cell.
Its gonna be from me.I need you to use it.Okay?

343
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:51,500
Okay.
What's in it?

344
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:56,640
Yo.
What the hell is in it,man?

345
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,320
Just use it,or you'll wish you had.

346
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,650
What's in the package?

347
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:03,980
What the hell is in the package,man?

348
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:06,260
Yo,what the hell is in the package,man?!

349
00:24:14,530 --> 00:24:16,370
I'm in the lobby.

350
00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:18,980
Take the stairs to your left.

351
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:23,990
When you get to the top,cross the catwalk.

352
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:32,930
Okay,I'm across.

353
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:36,180
Go down the hall,down the stairs to the basement.

354
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,730
Go through the white door.

355
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,300
The one on the left.

356
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,610
Sara,I wish you had come to me first.

357
00:24:58,650 --> 00:25:00,480
Cooper green and i go way back.

358
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:03,170
If anyone can help michael and lincoln,it's him.

359
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:03,800
Can I help you?

360
00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:05,410
Yeah.Is Mr. Green in?

361
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:07,200
Is he expecting you?

362
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:09,010
Bruce.

363
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:10,870
Oh,good,you're back.

364
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:11,990
I'm here to help you.

365
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:12,720
Help me?

366
00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:13,360
With what?

367
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:14,420
Scofield and burrows.

368
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,320
Where are they now?

369
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:16,240
This is absurd.

370
00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:18,490
This tunnel goes underground.

371
00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:20,910
You're already under another building.

372
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,930
See the second door on your right?

373
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:25,850
Congratulations.

374
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,700
You made it.

375
00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:33,940
I'sorry.Sara tancredi.

376
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,200
I-I trust you've met with michael scofield and lincoln burrows today?

377
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:39,690
Well,I'm sure I'd remember if I did.

378
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:41,330
Sara?

379
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:44,190
If you're cooper green,who's with michael right now?

380
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,330
Mr. Green?

381
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:50,380
I'm michael scofield.

382
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:54,000
Well,it's nice to finally meet you.

383
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:55,640
Do you...

384
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,880
uh,do you have the tape?

385
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,880
It's right here.

386
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:07,390
yeah.

387
00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:08,650
Lincoln,it's sara.Listen to me.

388
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:11,340
The man that michael's with right now is not cooper green,do you hear me?

389
00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:14,220
The man that michael's with right now is not cooper green.

390
00:26:27,610 --> 00:26:28,970
We should hurry.You're in chicago--

391
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:32,800
it won't be long before the company knows you're in town.

392
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:34,590
Where are we going?

393
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:38,610
Well,we're going to make sure that that tape goes in the right hands.

394
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:40,600
Whose?

395
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:43,040
A friend.

396
00:26:43,490 --> 00:26:45,840
What kind of friend?

397
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:48,230
He's a federal judge.

398
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:50,650
Is that good enough for you?

399
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:55,930
This tape is my brother's life.And mine.

400
00:26:56,140 --> 00:27:00,460
And consequently...I need a name.

401
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:08,940
Judge scott warren,a lifetime appointee who was put on the bench by president mills.

402
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:12,050
He has no job to lose,no loyalty to reynolds.

403
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:15,160
He wants to see her gone,just like us.

404
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:16,970
Well,let's go.

405
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,760
I-I,I left my car over by the statue.

406
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:21,060
You were tailed,Mr. Green.

407
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:24,240
The judge comes to us.

408
00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:26,560
I'll set up the meeting.

409
00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:28,510
Do you see my clothes?

410
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:32,440
Your brother made certain that anybody who was tailing me is long gone,

411
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,940
and on top of that,I'm an asthmatic.

412
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:39,790
My inhaler is in my jacket pocket,which lincoln made me throw away.

413
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:45,470
I'm okay now,but in about ten minutes,I'm gonna have a hard time breathing.

414
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:51,090
I've got a spare in my glove box,so could we please just get back to my car?

415
00:27:59,290 --> 00:28:01,830
My car is just a few blocks away.

416
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,690
Albuterol,cortizaid or prednizone?

417
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,440
What?

418
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:08,640
My mother was an asthmatic.

419
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,020
What do you use in your inhaler?

420
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:12,000
What the hell difference does it make?

421
00:28:12,050 --> 00:28:14,930
Just answer the question,please.

422
00:28:15,370 --> 00:28:17,560
You're a real piece of work,you know that?

423
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:19,550
How many times I got to prove myself to you?

424
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:21,330
Just one.

425
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:27,980
fine.Uh...cortizaid.

426
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:31,370
I'm sorry.

427
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:34,640
It's just,uh...if you knew what,

428
00:28:34,690 --> 00:28:37,750
uh,if you knew what we've been through...

429
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:39,380
I understand.

430
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,700
Can we now just,please go to my car?

431
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:43,470
Yeah.

432
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:01,540
One-way ticket to bangkok,s'il vous plait.

433
00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:03,110
Oh,I'm sorry.

434
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:05,090
We don't have anything until tomorrow.

435
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:09,450
Unless you don't mind taking a few connections through chicago,

436
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:11,740
and there's one more international stop.

437
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:13,270
Whatever leaves first.

438
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:15,390
Okay.I.D.,Please.

439
00:29:19,430 --> 00:29:21,380
Okay,mister...stammel?

440
00:29:21,410 --> 00:29:24,990
Oh,it's,uh,it's doctor stammel,and thank you.

441
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:26,740
All right,it'll be just a few minutes.

442
00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:27,630
I'll check this bag for you,sir.

443
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:28,760
Oh,no,that's coming with me.

444
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,570
Give it back.

445
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:34,600
Sir,I know that bag is way over the weight limit for carry-on.

446
00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:38,840
What difference does a few extra pounds make on a three-ton aircraft,

447
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:39,540
whether that's up above or underneath?

448
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:42,070
It's an faa violation.

449
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:45,300
Sir,your bag will be safe.

450
00:29:58,370 --> 00:30:01,940
Today will be a tough day for travelers in the windy city as all streets

451
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:07,170
In a six-block radius of the seaburn hotel have been closed to traffic

452
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:11,290
in anticipation of president reynolds's speech there this evening.

453
00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:13,920
This'll be one of several midwestern stops for the president

454
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:16,840
as she ramps up her election campaign.

455
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:21,550
Hey,theo,i know you're new,but we use both sides of legal pads in this office,okay?

456
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,370
Before we recycle,we reduce.

457
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:25,710
The comanche used the entire buffalo.

458
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:27,470
So can we.

459
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:30,000
Actually,a majority of tribes would farm land till

460
00:30:30,050 --> 00:30:33,070
it was stripped of its utility,then they'd just...move on.

461
00:30:33,130 --> 00:30:38,650
The indian as conservationist is a myth created by white liberal guilt.

462
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:40,550
Paul.

463
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:42,290
Hi,kristine.

464
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:44,920
I'd hoped maybe I'd see you at dad's funeral.

465
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:47,070
That man died long before his heart stopped.

466
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,820
That funeral was a formality.

467
00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:49,990
That's really not fair.

468
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:51,360
It's true.

469
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:53,700
So...you want to know how mom is?

470
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:57,540
Just 'cause someone spits you out of your crotch doesn't make them your mother.

471
00:30:57,590 --> 00:30:59,460
That woman is insane.

472
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:00,400
Do you remember?

473
00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:01,700
Have you suppressed it all?

474
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:02,260
I know,paul.

475
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:04,770
I was there every day...unlike you.

476
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:05,980
I was there for 18 years.

477
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:07,890
Then you just left.

478
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:09,800
I was ten,paul.

479
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:12,610
You were all I had in the world,and...

480
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:15,040
you just left me there.

481
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:18,200
I'm sorry.

482
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:22,540
If I could have taken you with me,I would have,

483
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:25,290
and I've thought about you every day.

484
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:37,330
I'm not the brother you remember.

485
00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:39,540
I've changed...

486
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:43,880
in A...really bad way.

487
00:31:43,910 --> 00:31:50,940
Uh...to the point where I don't know what good or bad is anymore,

488
00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:52,530
and I am going to do something--

489
00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:54,860
I have to do something...

490
00:31:55,930 --> 00:31:58,510
that a lot of people are going to think is horrible.

491
00:31:58,530 --> 00:31:59,160
Paul.

492
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:02,800
And you just remember...

493
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:04,950
the brother you grew up with.

494
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:07,390
You just remember him.

495
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:14,490
You're my sister,kristine,and I love you.

496
00:32:22,090 --> 00:32:23,270
I was out cold.

497
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,930
I don't know where they went.

498
00:32:24,970 --> 00:32:28,550
And it was their idea for you to meet them here in the middle of chicago?

499
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:31,110
Yeah.

500
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:36,870
oh,man.

501
00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:44,360
mahone.

502
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:46,920
You brought me in too late.They're gone.

503
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:49,850
then find them.

504
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:51,200
Let me get this straight.

505
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:54,510
The brothers come back to a city that's 15 miles from the prison they escaped from.

506
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:55,770
Why would they do that?

507
00:32:55,810 --> 00:32:58,060
Maybe it's because the president is in chicago to make a speech,

508
00:32:58,110 --> 00:33:01,930
and they're up to something,which is why we need to find them.

509
00:33:01,990 --> 00:33:04,050
And of all people,they want to meet with somebody

510
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,310
from the attorney general's office?

511
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:08,020
Your point?

512
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:09,790
Burrows is innocent.

513
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:12,810
Wow,you're good,alex.

514
00:33:12,850 --> 00:33:15,110
As advertised.

515
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:17,430
No one's truly innocent.

516
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:20,000
You of all people should know that.

517
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:26,670
it must have been the receptionist.

518
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:28,670
She's the only one I spoke to.

519
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:43,410
michael scofield.

520
00:33:43,450 --> 00:33:45,620
Cooper green.

521
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:42,350
We got to get as much of that in as possible before the baby gets here.

522
00:34:42,390 --> 00:34:44,140
Why?

523
00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:51,300
Because,once the baby's growing in there,doesn't it just get kind of wrong?

524
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:53,130
Oh,yeah.

525
00:34:57,130 --> 00:34:58,630
- Whoa.
- What?

526
00:34:58,670 --> 00:34:59,890
I just felt the baby move.

527
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:01,610
Fernando,that's impossible--it's a little too early...

528
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:04,200
I know what I just felt.

529
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:10,030
Well,the doctor did say that he can become active after certain activities.

530
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:15,240
Whoa!Did you feel that?

531
00:35:15,290 --> 00:35:16,620
Yeah,like a flutter.

532
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:17,690
Flutter my ass.

533
00:35:17,730 --> 00:35:18,430
He's strong.

534
00:35:18,490 --> 00:35:21,360
He's going to be the captain of the national soccer team.

535
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:23,860
You hear that,junior?

536
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:26,670
As soon as you're born,I'm putting a soccer ball in your hands.

537
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:28,780
No,he's going to have books.

538
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:31,270
Fine.

539
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:33,650
Books about soccer.

540
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:38,480
See,baby.

541
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:41,360
I told you everything was going to work out.

542
00:35:41,410 --> 00:35:45,610
We're out in the middle of nowhere,baby's doing great.

543
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,180
Everything's going to be perfect.

544
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:53,740
Well,it looks like we've got nothing but smooth skies ahead,

545
00:35:53,770 --> 00:35:55,570
so we should be arriving in mexico right on time.

546
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:56,870
Excuse me.

547
00:35:56,890 --> 00:35:59,510
When's the meal coming around?I'm starved.

548
00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:01,230
As a way to keep ticket prices low,

549
00:36:01,270 --> 00:36:04,300
we have removed the in-flight meal from our service package.

550
00:36:04,350 --> 00:36:06,720
What's left on the service package?

551
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:09,810
Pretzels and bags of krispity krunch.

552
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:11,680
Pretzels.

553
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:14,010
Just a few minutes.

554
00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:21,080
Freshen me up when you get a chance,darlin'.

555
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,510
Right away,dr.Stammel.

556
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:30,990
Dede's doing real good.

557
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:35,230
She's responding to the meds,um,eating.

558
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:38,470
she's going to be okay.

559
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,810
Because of you.

560
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:48,430
She's going to be okay because of you.

561
00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:57,160
I need to know...that you forgive me.

562
00:36:57,310 --> 00:36:58,390
I know that.

563
00:36:58,410 --> 00:37:00,780
Of course I forgive you.

564
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:06,260
You know when dede was like four,she wanted to watch this video.

565
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:10,760
And I kept telling her you know,"after the game,after the game,okay?¡±

566
00:37:10,810 --> 00:37:14,450
She kept asking and kept asking,and I lost my patience and I snapped at her.

567
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,140
I snapped at her real bad.

568
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:19,750
She went over into the corner,and...

569
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:24,210
I didn't even go over and say anything.

570
00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:28,710
Why are you getting yourself upset over something that happened years ago,baby?

571
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:30,160
Years ago.Dede loves you.

572
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,530
Baby,I want you to do something for me.

573
00:37:31,570 --> 00:37:36,280
I want you to tell her that I'm sorry.

574
00:37:36,330 --> 00:37:37,550
I'm so sorry.

575
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:39,800
And that my baby girls means everything to me--

576
00:37:39,830 --> 00:37:43,460
I want you to tell her that she means everything to me,okay?

577
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,980
- You tell her that every day.
-Time.

578
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,780
- No matter what...
- ma'am...

579
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:50,140
tell her.Tell her,okay?

580
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:52,440
No matter what,you promise that,okay?

581
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:54,890
Please,please,you got to tell her.

582
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:55,960
You have to tell her...

583
00:37:55,990 --> 00:37:57,340
okay,okay.

584
00:37:57,390 --> 00:37:59,610
Ma'am.You really have to gO.

585
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:02,310
Tell her,tell her.

586
00:38:19,490 --> 00:38:22,330
Attentn,attention.

587
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:26,360
All spectators must remain behind the barricades at all times.

588
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:35,230
whoa..Got a boom charlie half block south.

589
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:36,990
Team leader wants you there right now.

590
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:37,800
What's the M.O.?

591
00:38:37,850 --> 00:38:40,010
He's got an ied strapped to...

592
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:48,610
he asked you to come to this fountainpecifically?

593
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,200
Yeah.

594
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:55,290
Let me take a look at that park map.

595
00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:00,900
Why not the fountain on the east side of the park?

596
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:03,690
Because this one's closer to the pay phone he called me on.

597
00:39:04,010 --> 00:39:06,220
No,because this one's closer to them.

598
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:08,280
They tell you to meet them at the statue.

599
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:10,150
Then the fountain.

600
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:13,070
Then they send you to the building across the park.

601
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,710
Why?

602
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:18,590
'Cause they want to keep you in their sights.

603
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:21,020
Because they're watching you.

604
00:39:22,010 --> 00:39:23,200
But from where?

605
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:25,670
Statue,fountain,building...

606
00:39:28,430 --> 00:39:30,990
there.the hotel

607
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,640
You know what you have?

608
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:37,890
I think we have a pretty good idea.

609
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:39,090
What you doing?

610
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:40,940
Getting all unique data from the memory key

611
00:39:40,970 --> 00:39:43,480
so we can identify this key from any other--

612
00:39:43,530 --> 00:39:48,520
label it,start a proper record of a chain of custody to present to the judges I trust.

613
00:39:54,090 --> 00:39:55,310
no.

614
00:39:55,330 --> 00:39:57,080
What's wrong?

615
00:39:57,130 --> 00:39:59,920
No,it's the date stamp on the memory key.

616
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:01,570
It's the copy date.

617
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:02,870
I'm sorry,what's that?

618
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:04,790
It's the date the damn thing was copied,

619
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:07,810
not the date that the conversation was originally recorded.

620
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:08,840
So what?

621
00:40:08,890 --> 00:40:10,840
I mean,you heard what was on the tape.

622
00:40:10,890 --> 00:40:16,080
Without a time stamp of exactly when this conversation took place,

623
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:18,520
we can't prove that this is terrence steadman talking

624
00:40:18,570 --> 00:40:21,090
after you supposedly killed him.

625
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:23,960
This could have happened a year before his funeral.

626
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:29,400
No,it can't be authenticated,so it can't be admitted to any court as evidence.

627
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:32,950
People died because of this.My family died.

628
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,750
I'm sorry.

629
00:40:36,370 --> 00:40:39,270
Legally speaking,this tape is useless.

630
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:48,400
Alexander mahone,fbi.

631
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:51,310
Have either of these men checked in?

632
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:52,680
No,not that i've seen.

633
00:40:52,730 --> 00:40:54,490
What about this woman?

634
00:40:55,530 --> 00:40:57,500
Yeah.

635
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:00,940
Room 10-06.

636
00:41:00,990 --> 00:41:02,770
10-06,10-06.Thank you.

637
00:41:06,870 --> 00:41:07,930
It's not over.

638
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,030
We're this close.

639
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:10,720
You already said it's done.

640
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:14,770
Actually,I said it couldn't help exonerate you in a court of law.

641
00:41:15,650 --> 00:41:17,890
Maybe it can help you outside the law.

642
00:41:18,370 --> 00:41:19,990
How?

643
00:41:20,030 --> 00:41:21,980
Well,we all heard the conversation.

644
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:26,210
There's more to this tape than potential proof of lincoln's innocence.

645
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:29,270
There is proof of caroline reynold's guilt.

646
00:41:29,310 --> 00:41:33,550
Guilt about something that she does not want anyone to know anything about.

647
00:41:33,590 --> 00:41:36,140
So we blackmail her.

648
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:38,420
I'm an officer of the court.

649
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:40,390
I...i didn't say that.

650
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,850
Blackmail in exchange for what?

651
00:41:44,410 --> 00:41:46,760
A presidential pardon.

652
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:49,370
The woman that set me up...

653
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:51,790
is going to set me free.

654
00:41:52,770 --> 00:41:56,140
I think she'll sign it with her own hand.

655
00:41:57,820 --> 00:41:59,150
Ace team,beta team --

656
00:41:59,170 --> 00:42:01,380
this is leader one.

657
00:42:05,830 --> 00:42:09,340
The squaw will reach home base in t minus two minutes.

658
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,880
I love you.

659
00:42:33,170 --> 00:42:34,700


660
00:42:34,790 --> 00:42:36,560
