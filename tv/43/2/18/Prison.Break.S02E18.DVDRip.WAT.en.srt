1
00:00:01,134 --> 00:00:02,601
<i>Previously on Prison Break:</i>

2
00:00:02,769 --> 00:00:04,737
It will work out. You have my word.

3
00:00:04,904 --> 00:00:06,303
Be careful.

4
00:00:06,473 --> 00:00:08,236
Jane's gonna look after you. Hey.

5
00:00:10,076 --> 00:00:12,203
I have a sister I haven't talked to
in 15 years.

6
00:00:12,379 --> 00:00:14,677
-You think she's better off for it?
-Bruce?

7
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:17,840
We said not to use this number,
but I needed to know you were okay.

8
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:19,246
It was you.

9
00:00:19,419 --> 00:00:21,284
<i>What are you talking about, Sara?</i>

10
00:00:24,891 --> 00:00:27,917
I got three words for you.
We gotta run.

11
00:00:28,962 --> 00:00:32,022
I wanna turn myself in.
But I got one condition.

12
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:34,098
Your wife was released an hour ago.

13
00:00:34,267 --> 00:00:37,600
She'll be here soon.
Just hold up your end of the deal.

14
00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:39,102
I'll get you Scofield.

15
00:00:39,272 --> 00:00:41,866
An NSA analyst
sympathetic to our cause...

16
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:45,773
...got his hands on a phone conversation
the president had with Terrence Steadman...

17
00:00:45,945 --> 00:00:48,641
...two weeks
after you supposedly killed him.

18
00:00:48,815 --> 00:00:52,444
Twenty-four hours later, Tancredi is dead,
the analyst is missing...

19
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:56,248
...and the White House echelon tapes
have been deleted from the mainframe.

20
00:00:56,423 --> 00:00:58,482
There's a tape.
It gives us everything we need.

21
00:00:58,658 --> 00:01:00,717
Linc will be set free if we find it.

22
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:02,327
You have something here.

23
00:01:02,495 --> 00:01:04,827
There'll be a lot
who wish you didn't, but you do.

24
00:01:04,998 --> 00:01:07,432
You think it's a conversation?

25
00:01:08,001 --> 00:01:09,468
One they don't want us to hear.

26
00:01:12,038 --> 00:01:14,563
-You ready?
-Let's do it.

27
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:46,004
Oh, my God.

28
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,267
Yeah.

29
00:01:51,878 --> 00:01:55,370
Patoshik, dead.

30
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:59,775
Franklin, incarcerated and assisting
with the capture of Scofield and Burrows.

31
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:03,184
-What exactly is the protocol with that?
-I'll handle that.

32
00:02:03,356 --> 00:02:04,914
We're at the halfway mark, people.

33
00:02:05,091 --> 00:02:08,993
Burrows, Scofield, Bagwell, Sucre.

34
00:02:09,162 --> 00:02:10,424
They're still out there.

35
00:02:10,597 --> 00:02:13,225
-Now, I heard a report came in from....
-Mexico.

36
00:02:13,399 --> 00:02:16,562
Fernando Sucre was almost apprehended
at the airport in lxtapa.

37
00:02:25,578 --> 00:02:26,806
Excuse me.

38
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:30,839
My office, please.

39
00:02:33,887 --> 00:02:36,822
-What the hell are you doing here?
-I came for my damn money.

40
00:02:37,957 --> 00:02:40,255
-Your what?
-The Patoshik reward money.

41
00:02:40,426 --> 00:02:44,419
See, how a reward works is,
someone gets rewarded the money.

42
00:02:44,597 --> 00:02:46,724
And since I'm the one
who bloodhounded Haywire...

43
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,367
...the money gets rewarded to me.

44
00:02:48,535 --> 00:02:49,763
You come to my office--?

45
00:02:49,936 --> 00:02:52,837
If you'd returned any of my calls,
I wouldn't have had to.

46
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:55,440
-We had a deal.
-The deal was you stay under the radar.

47
00:02:55,608 --> 00:02:57,439
Is this under the radar, Brad?

48
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:01,273
No, this is an office full of federal agents
who now have all seen your face.

49
00:03:01,447 --> 00:03:03,506
Hey, I don't care what they see.

50
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:09,315
Hell, if you don't pay up,
I'll go out there and drop trou.

51
00:03:23,102 --> 00:03:26,265
Patoshik died, you stupid son of a bitch.

52
00:03:26,472 --> 00:03:29,805
There's paperwork involved.
Of course, you're gonna get the money.

53
00:03:29,976 --> 00:03:31,409
But you'll have to be patient.

54
00:03:32,345 --> 00:03:36,611
And if you ever
come in my office again...

55
00:03:37,984 --> 00:03:40,350
...you will not only never see the cash...

56
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,647
...you'll never see another sunrise.

57
00:03:51,197 --> 00:03:54,496
Now, we gonna keep crying about money
you've already got coming to you...

58
00:03:55,535 --> 00:03:57,628
...or do you wanna make some more?

59
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,172
I'm listening.

60
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:04,572
Ever been to Mexico?

61
00:04:07,847 --> 00:04:10,509
We give this to the press,
the government will discredit it.

62
00:04:10,683 --> 00:04:12,651
Just like they did with the tape we made.

63
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:14,081
Okay.

64
00:04:14,787 --> 00:04:17,312
So, what do we do with it?

65
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:20,323
There are people in the administration
Dad was working with.

66
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:23,824
If we give it to them, they'll finally have
the smoking gun they need...

67
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:25,828
...to bring Caroline Reynolds down.

68
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:28,963
But they'll release the tape, not us.

69
00:04:29,135 --> 00:04:31,797
And how can she discredit
her own appointees? Sure.

70
00:04:31,971 --> 00:04:34,565
We're gonna give the only thing
that can exonerate me...

71
00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:36,675
...to someone who works
for the government?

72
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:40,006
The same government that set me up?!

73
00:04:40,413 --> 00:04:43,871
We'll have to find someone we can trust.
Someone honest.

74
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:45,674
Jane Phillips.

75
00:04:45,852 --> 00:04:47,615
She'll know someone that can help us.

76
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:49,516
She worked with Dad.
She's watching L.J.

77
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:51,220
I trust her, Michael.

78
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:53,549
She'll do it. She'll find someone.

79
00:04:55,862 --> 00:04:57,625
Well, I hope you're right.

80
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:02,599
Because this is our last shot.

81
00:05:04,404 --> 00:05:05,632
This'll do you right.

82
00:05:05,938 --> 00:05:08,031
It's good from a thousand yards out.

83
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:10,006
She a clean shot?

84
00:05:10,176 --> 00:05:12,667
Like a good woman, she does not stray.

85
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:16,107
Bariment stainless steel fluted barrel,
.308 caliber...

86
00:05:16,282 --> 00:05:19,581
...175 grain, hollow point.

87
00:05:21,888 --> 00:05:25,051
-I'll take the case too.
-She's a throw-in.

88
00:05:29,362 --> 00:05:31,091
The serial numbers have been cleaned.

89
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:33,664
The chamber's been scraped
to throw off ballistics...

90
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:37,394
...just in case you're not,
you know, shooting at tin cans.

91
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:41,902
No, I'm hunting bigger game than that.

92
00:05:43,543 --> 00:05:44,942
Hey! Hey, hey!

93
00:06:22,815 --> 00:06:25,010
Radio silence.

94
00:06:26,252 --> 00:06:28,948
I just don't know how often
he checks this thing, all right?

95
00:06:29,122 --> 00:06:32,888
Well, it seems not that often,
considering you've posted three messages.

96
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:35,050
I'm starting to wonder
why I need you at all.

97
00:06:35,428 --> 00:06:37,988
To get Scofield. What?
What are we doing here?

98
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:42,095
Well, I can type, and Scofield can't see
who's sending him the messages.

99
00:06:42,268 --> 00:06:45,965
Well, he's gonna see whatever little
rent-a-fed cops that you guys have set up...

100
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:48,073
...whatever place you'll set up
to meet him.

101
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:50,402
You and I both know
how smart this kid is, right?

102
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:52,771
Smarter than you,
considering you're wearing orange.

103
00:06:52,945 --> 00:06:55,641
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

104
00:06:55,815 --> 00:06:59,717
Fish is not gonna peek his little white ass
out from any rock that he's hiding...

105
00:06:59,886 --> 00:07:01,114
...unless he sees a--

106
00:07:01,287 --> 00:07:02,982
A familiar-- And that's your face?

107
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:05,249
Yeah, you're damned straight it is.
Don't pretend like you don't need me.

108
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:08,155
You said you overheard him telling Sucre
about a website....

109
00:07:08,327 --> 00:07:10,625
-Don't pretend you don't need me!
-You overheard--

110
00:07:10,797 --> 00:07:13,664
-He's a Boy Scout.
-I don't see how that helps!

111
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:16,097
If you have a bit of patience,
he will hit me back!

112
00:07:16,702 --> 00:07:18,499
I'm the only one now
helping your family.

113
00:07:18,671 --> 00:07:20,161
-I help my family, okay?
-So do I.

114
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:22,807
I got Kacee released.
I get Dede medical care.

115
00:07:22,975 --> 00:07:26,809
I'm the one that allows you to visit them,
and I'm the one that can take it away.

116
00:07:26,979 --> 00:07:29,504
It looks like we both need each other,
doesn't it?

117
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:33,142
-Do we?
-So I'll hold up my end of the bargain.

118
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:36,516
And guess what? You hold up yours.

119
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,554
Now, get off my back.

120
00:07:41,093 --> 00:07:44,995
You can get what you want.
Just give me what I want.

121
00:07:45,164 --> 00:07:47,064
Give me Scofield.

122
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:54,531
<i>-Hello?
-Hey, buddy.</i>

123
00:07:54,707 --> 00:07:55,969
Dad?

124
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,842
Yeah, it's me. How you holding up?

125
00:07:59,278 --> 00:08:00,973
Okay. How about you?

126
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:03,206
Good. Good.

127
00:08:03,382 --> 00:08:06,510
I miss you.

128
00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:08,347
<i>Yeah, me too.</i>

129
00:08:08,521 --> 00:08:10,512
I didn't know you had Jane's number.

130
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:14,087
Yeah. Well, we exchanged numbers
when you guys split.

131
00:08:14,927 --> 00:08:17,794
-You never called.
-No. Yeah.

132
00:08:17,964 --> 00:08:21,491
I'm sorry. It's been,
it's been dangerous, you know.

133
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:23,635
-Real dangerous.
-It's okay.

134
00:08:23,803 --> 00:08:27,068
L.J., listen. I know I've said this before...

135
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,775
...we've found something
that'll finally put this stuff behind us.

136
00:08:30,943 --> 00:08:34,606
When it's good, when it's safe,
I'm gonna come and get you.

137
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:37,214
-You, me, your uncle, we can--
-Dad.

138
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:41,544
<i>-Yeah?
-I want you to end this more than anything.</i>

139
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:45,355
But I'm in school again.

140
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:48,016
Under a fake name,
but it's still school, you know?

141
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:49,922
<i>I mean, it's not the same...</i>

142
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:54,294
<i>...but it's the closest thing to a home
I've had in a long time.</i>

143
00:08:54,934 --> 00:08:58,461
<i>I guess-- I guess I'm just saying...</i>

144
00:08:58,905 --> 00:09:02,636
<i>...that for now, for a while...</i>

145
00:09:03,242 --> 00:09:05,039
...I just wanna stay in one place.

146
00:09:06,012 --> 00:09:08,037
<i>Have something normal.</i>

147
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:11,372
Yeah, yeah. I get it.

148
00:09:12,184 --> 00:09:13,947
<i>I....</i>

149
00:09:14,253 --> 00:09:16,744
<i>-I need to speak with Jane.
-Okay.</i>

150
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,254
I love you, Dad.

151
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:24,086
I love you too, son.

152
00:09:32,638 --> 00:09:36,096
Mr. Webster, sorry to keep you waiting.

153
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:38,001
Oh, it's no problem, doc.

154
00:09:38,177 --> 00:09:40,577
I just wanted to tell you
how much I appreciate you...

155
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:42,907
...seeing me on such short notice.

156
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:44,413
That's what I'm here for.

157
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:46,809
Good.

158
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:50,750
Because I got a few things
I need to get off my chest.

159
00:09:51,157 --> 00:09:52,818
See you, Jane.

160
00:10:02,668 --> 00:10:04,499
Cooper Green?

161
00:10:05,871 --> 00:10:07,498
Former deputy attorney general.

162
00:10:07,673 --> 00:10:10,039
Splits his time between D.C.,
Chicago and New York.

163
00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:12,439
Jane says he's been an ally
of Dad's forever.

164
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,546
We find him, we got a shot.

165
00:10:19,485 --> 00:10:20,952
How's L.J.?

166
00:10:22,822 --> 00:10:24,517
He's all right.

167
00:10:29,695 --> 00:10:31,663
Cooper Green's office.

168
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:35,392
<i>-Sorry, Mr. Green isn't available at this time.
-Please, this is very important.</i>

169
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:39,368
Just tell him I have some information
regarding the sons of Aldo Burrows.

170
00:10:39,872 --> 00:10:41,669
<i>-Aldo Burrows?
-Yes.</i>

171
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:43,809
He and Mr. Green used to work together.

172
00:10:44,276 --> 00:10:46,403
Please hold. I'll try to reach him.

173
00:10:49,281 --> 00:10:50,873
She's tracking him down.

174
00:10:53,886 --> 00:10:57,014
<i>-Hello.
-Mr. Green, this is Michael Scofield.</i>

175
00:10:57,189 --> 00:10:58,417
<i>Do you know who I am?</i>

176
00:10:58,591 --> 00:11:01,424
Of course. I knew your father,
and I know what happened to him.

177
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:03,994
I'm sorry. He was a good man
trying to do good things.

178
00:11:04,363 --> 00:11:05,830
Well, so are we.

179
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:07,761
We have something.

180
00:11:07,933 --> 00:11:09,730
<i>-The tape?
-You've heard of it?</i>

181
00:11:09,902 --> 00:11:12,393
Well, I know a lot of people
have been looking for it.

182
00:11:12,571 --> 00:11:13,868
What's on the tape?

183
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,941
If you want to find out,
there is a bronze statue of a mammoth...

184
00:11:17,109 --> 00:11:18,940
...at the southwest corner of Ebert Park.

185
00:11:19,111 --> 00:11:20,408
I need you there in an hour.

186
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:22,046
<i>-Do you have a blue suit?
-Yes.</i>

187
00:11:22,214 --> 00:11:23,613
Wear it, and a red tie.

188
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:26,949
That way, we'll know who you are.

189
00:11:28,454 --> 00:11:29,682
Ready?

190
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,021
Yeah.

191
00:11:36,962 --> 00:11:38,190
Good luck.

192
00:11:49,675 --> 00:11:52,508
-This'll work.
-You think?

193
00:12:32,818 --> 00:12:34,445
Hello, Sara.

194
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:38,046
I figured you'd show up eventually.

195
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:39,986
You look good, Bruce.

196
00:12:41,627 --> 00:12:44,653
You've done well for yourself
at my father's expense.

197
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:47,831
I had nothing to do with your father.
He was murdered.

198
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,696
By you, and then you tried
to have me killed. Don't--

199
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:52,201
How can you say that?

200
00:12:52,371 --> 00:12:55,704
My line was tapped, they heard you tell me
that you were at that payphone.

201
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:59,834
-Sara, I've known your family my entire life.
-Which makes your betrayal disgusting.

202
00:13:02,748 --> 00:13:05,444
For what it's worth,
I've been tortured already. Didn't work.

203
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:07,449
I shouldn't have to defend myself to you.

204
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:11,317
If you can't trust me,
then all I can do is just wish you luck.

205
00:13:12,224 --> 00:13:13,657
Go.

206
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:38,045
<i>Look, before you get started,
I'm gonna save you some time here, jefe.</i>

207
00:13:38,217 --> 00:13:40,708
I played rat for you once,
and that was it.

208
00:13:40,886 --> 00:13:42,649
I got protection now.

209
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:47,282
I let the top bangers in here cherry-pick
the laundry, clean sheets, new shorts.

210
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:50,758
And for that, I'm untouchable.

211
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:53,228
So threaten all you want, homes.

212
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:01,563
Yo, man, what are you gonna do?

213
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:04,574
You don't look like
you play too much tennis, Manche.

214
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:07,841
This is probably more your speed.

215
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:09,747
Entertainment center.

216
00:14:10,282 --> 00:14:12,876
Wide-screen plasma.

217
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:16,547
Pinball. Pool table.

218
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:20,290
-What the hell is this?
-Your future.

219
00:14:20,492 --> 00:14:23,427
At Kankakee Minimum Security
Correctional Center...

220
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:26,622
...where the only thing softer
than the pillows are the guards.

221
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:29,767
I didn't come here to threaten.

222
00:14:29,935 --> 00:14:31,163
I mean, why whip the mule...

223
00:14:31,337 --> 00:14:34,204
...when he'll work even harder
for a sugar cube?

224
00:14:35,641 --> 00:14:39,099
The same connections got this fox
out of the river so quick.

225
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:41,405
Well, I can use them for you too.

226
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:47,644
<i>All I need to know is where down in Mejico
your cousin Sucre is headed.</i>

227
00:15:08,374 --> 00:15:10,604
Look, mami, look.

228
00:15:10,776 --> 00:15:13,074
I told you. Llamas.

229
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:14,769
I think those are alpacas.

230
00:15:14,947 --> 00:15:17,279
That's what I said. A pack of Ilamas.

231
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,275
Fernando! Fernando!

232
00:15:57,389 --> 00:15:58,947
What I'm trying to tell you, doc...

233
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:03,618
...is I just feel like I've been a penny
on the train tracks my entire life.

234
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:08,759
And that old Union Pacific
just keeps on coming every day.

235
00:16:08,934 --> 00:16:13,997
Back and forth, just running me down,
running me over, but I will not flatten.

236
00:16:14,173 --> 00:16:15,663
I will not flatten.

237
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:18,499
You know the nice things about pennies,
Mr. Webster?

238
00:16:18,677 --> 00:16:20,338
They have dates on them.

239
00:16:20,512 --> 00:16:23,174
And you can pick the date.
Your own date.

240
00:16:23,782 --> 00:16:25,215
Today's date.

241
00:16:25,384 --> 00:16:27,352
You can get a fresh start.

242
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,883
You can be a brand-new shiny penny.

243
00:16:32,524 --> 00:16:37,587
You know, I gotta be honest with you, doc.
I had no intention of, whatsoever...

244
00:16:37,763 --> 00:16:40,163
...talking to you
once I got inside your office today.

245
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:44,166
But I have to admit, I find therapy....

246
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:49,171
Well, it's therapeutic.

247
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:51,365
I don't follow.

248
00:16:51,543 --> 00:16:54,808
If you didn't plan on talking today,
why did you come in?

249
00:17:01,253 --> 00:17:06,281
Well, I saw that ad
on the back of the bus stop today...

250
00:17:08,293 --> 00:17:12,787
...and though it wasn't exactly
like looking in the mirror...

251
00:17:13,665 --> 00:17:20,161
...you can't deny that there's a certain
commonality in our visages.

252
00:17:23,475 --> 00:17:26,205
I guess we do look a little bit alike.

253
00:17:28,781 --> 00:17:30,840
But I don't understand.

254
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,714
What--? What the hell you think
you're doing?

255
00:18:12,224 --> 00:18:14,215
<i>-Hello.
-Mr. Green?</i>

256
00:18:14,393 --> 00:18:17,521
-Yes.
-This is Lincoln Burrows.

257
00:18:17,996 --> 00:18:19,463
Do exactly what I say.

258
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:23,296
Your suit jacket.
Toss it in the trash behind you.

259
00:18:23,469 --> 00:18:25,994
-Excuse me?
-Do it.

260
00:18:39,918 --> 00:18:43,752
All right, I just threw
my $2000 Zegna suit jacket in the garbage.

261
00:18:43,922 --> 00:18:45,480
<i>Good.</i>

262
00:18:45,691 --> 00:18:49,024
There's a fountain on the other side
of the park. Be there in four minutes.

263
00:18:49,361 --> 00:18:50,885
Four--?

264
00:19:11,216 --> 00:19:13,878
Make it quick.
The cell is running out of juice.

265
00:19:14,052 --> 00:19:15,815
You were right.

266
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:18,146
<i>-He's being tailed?
-Yeah.</i>

267
00:19:19,191 --> 00:19:20,681
On it.

268
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,098
<i>-Yeah?
-I'm looking for a guy in a suit.</i>

269
00:19:31,537 --> 00:19:33,505
Lot of guys with suits--

270
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:35,037
It's me.

271
00:19:35,207 --> 00:19:36,834
<i>See the fountain?</i>

272
00:19:39,778 --> 00:19:42,747
<i>-How could I not?
-Get in.</i>

273
00:20:12,477 --> 00:20:14,945
They wanna drown the mics,
in case we bugged him.

274
00:20:21,954 --> 00:20:24,923
Hey, mister. This is for you.

275
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:27,718
-I'm not interested.
-I'm not selling it.

276
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:32,455
Some dude gave me 20 bucks
to give it to the first wet guy I see. Here.

277
00:20:35,701 --> 00:20:37,601
<i>See the building across from you?</i>

278
00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:39,760
<i>-Yeah.
-Go inside.</i>

279
00:20:39,938 --> 00:20:42,532
This is getting ridiculous.
I've done everything you asked.

280
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:45,939
-lf you wanna meet me--
-Been burned way too many times.

281
00:20:46,111 --> 00:20:48,409
We need to make sure
this thing goes down right.

282
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,741
Go inside,
and keep the phone to your ear.

283
00:21:03,395 --> 00:21:04,623
-Yeah?
-Where are we?

284
00:21:04,796 --> 00:21:07,629
<i>They've gone inside the Beck Museum.
But we got men out back.</i>

285
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:09,391
He's not going anywhere.

286
00:21:14,473 --> 00:21:16,134
<i>-Yeah?
-Get to Ebert Park.</i>

287
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:18,776
<i>I have men on Scofield and Burrows.</i>

288
00:21:19,077 --> 00:21:20,339
Ebert Park?

289
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:22,878
Scofield set a meet with a target
we're surveilling.

290
00:21:23,248 --> 00:21:25,307
What the hell's Scofield doing
in Chicago?

291
00:21:25,484 --> 00:21:28,476
You're asking why the deer walked
into your cross hairs?

292
00:21:29,254 --> 00:21:31,313
Just take the shot, Mahone.

293
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:32,855
I'm on it, I'm on it.

294
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:34,492
<i>And, Alex.</i>

295
00:21:35,027 --> 00:21:36,324
Franklin.

296
00:21:36,595 --> 00:21:39,723
<i>-I'm using Franklin to help me find Scofield.
-Yeah.</i>

297
00:21:39,898 --> 00:21:41,627
<i>We don't need him for that anymore.</i>

298
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:45,230
What I do need is a death
with no questions.

299
00:21:55,981 --> 00:22:00,543
Hey, look, it's nothing yet, man,
but I'm sure he'll hit me real soon, okay?

300
00:22:08,193 --> 00:22:10,923
You know, if I were in your situation...

301
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:15,131
...everything you've done,
every decision you've made...

302
00:22:16,635 --> 00:22:18,262
...I'd have done the same thing.

303
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,804
You're a good man, a good father.

304
00:22:24,543 --> 00:22:27,876
There's been a change of plans.

305
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:32,074
And it looks like I'm not
gonna need your help after all.

306
00:22:35,253 --> 00:22:37,619
So you found Scofield.

307
00:22:38,957 --> 00:22:41,983
My colleagues
are getting pretty close, yeah.

308
00:22:42,661 --> 00:22:46,062
-So--
-So I guess you can set me free, then.

309
00:22:49,301 --> 00:22:51,292
Of course not.

310
00:22:59,111 --> 00:23:02,569
-You and me, we had a deal, right?
-Right.

311
00:23:03,815 --> 00:23:08,479
I get your wife released,
take care of your daughter's health...

312
00:23:09,121 --> 00:23:10,645
...and you get me Scofield.

313
00:23:12,691 --> 00:23:14,989
But you're getting him yourself.
You just said that.

314
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,822
I know, I know.
I just want you to know...

315
00:23:21,099 --> 00:23:25,468
...that I'm gonna keep my promise to you,
and I'm gonna help your family.

316
00:23:27,139 --> 00:23:29,073
But I'm gonna need your help too.

317
00:23:29,641 --> 00:23:31,836
And this is something
you're not gonna wanna do.

318
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:34,001
I don't want you to do this,
but I need you to.

319
00:23:34,179 --> 00:23:36,238
If you don't,
I'll have Kacee arrested again...

320
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:38,508
...and I'll have
Dede's medical care stopped...

321
00:23:38,683 --> 00:23:41,083
...and I will hate myself,
and it'll make me sick...

322
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:42,880
...but I swear to God....

323
00:23:45,557 --> 00:23:48,048
I will ruin their lives. Don't make me.

324
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,126
What the hell are you saying to me?

325
00:23:52,664 --> 00:23:54,495
Later, you'll get a package in your cell.

326
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:57,100
It's gonna be from me.
I need you to use it, okay?

327
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:58,827
Well, what's in it?

328
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:03,364
Yo. Yo, what the hell is in it, man?

329
00:24:03,542 --> 00:24:06,204
Just use it or you'll wish you had.

330
00:24:06,678 --> 00:24:08,441
What's in the package?

331
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:10,911
What the hell is in the package, man?

332
00:24:11,082 --> 00:24:13,312
Yo, what the hell is in the package, man?

333
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:23,055
Okay, I'm in the lobby.

334
00:24:24,029 --> 00:24:25,656
Take the stairs to your left.

335
00:24:28,366 --> 00:24:31,392
<i>When you get to the top,
cross the catwalk.</i>

336
00:24:38,243 --> 00:24:39,471
Okay, I'm across.

337
00:24:39,945 --> 00:24:42,413
Go down the hall,
down the stairs to the basement.

338
00:24:56,294 --> 00:24:58,091
Go through the white door.

339
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:00,328
<i>The one on the left.</i>

340
00:25:03,401 --> 00:25:05,426
Sara, I wish you'd come to me first.

341
00:25:05,604 --> 00:25:07,333
Cooper Green and I go way back.

342
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:10,031
If anyone can help Michael
and Lincoln, it's him.

343
00:25:10,208 --> 00:25:12,233
-Can I help you?
-Yeah, is Mr. Green in?

344
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:13,877
Is he expecting you?

345
00:25:14,212 --> 00:25:15,509
Bruce.

346
00:25:16,147 --> 00:25:18,843
Oh, good, you're back.
I'm here to help you.

347
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:22,077
-Help me? With what?
-Scofield and Burrows. Where are they now?

348
00:25:22,254 --> 00:25:25,553
<i>-This is absurd.
-Mr. Green, this tunnel goes underground.</i>

349
00:25:25,724 --> 00:25:27,885
<i>You're already under another building.</i>

350
00:25:28,059 --> 00:25:30,152
See the second door on your right?

351
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:32,420
Congratulations.

352
00:25:32,797 --> 00:25:34,389
You made it.

353
00:25:39,671 --> 00:25:40,899
I'm sorry, Sara Tancredi.

354
00:25:41,072 --> 00:25:43,870
I trust you've met with Scofield
and Burrows today?

355
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:45,805
Well, I'm sure I'd remember if I did.

356
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:48,201
Sara?

357
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:50,974
If you're Cooper Green,
who's with Michael right now?

358
00:25:52,417 --> 00:25:54,248
Mr. Green?

359
00:25:55,253 --> 00:25:57,050
I'm Michael Scofield.

360
00:25:58,423 --> 00:26:00,857
Well, it's nice to finally meet you.

361
00:26:01,526 --> 00:26:03,653
Do you have the tape?

362
00:26:04,796 --> 00:26:06,388
It's right here.

363
00:26:13,772 --> 00:26:15,569
<i>-Yeah?
-Lincoln, it's Sara. Listen to me.</i>

364
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:18,208
The man Michael's with
is not Cooper Green. You hear me?

365
00:26:18,376 --> 00:26:20,970
The man that Michael's with right now
is not Cooper Green.

366
00:26:37,829 --> 00:26:39,353
We should hurry. We're in Chicago.

367
00:26:39,531 --> 00:26:43,126
Won't be long before the Company knows
you're in town.

368
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:44,800
Where are we going?

369
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:48,531
Well, we're gonna make sure
that that tape goes into the right hands.

370
00:26:48,807 --> 00:26:50,104
Whose?

371
00:26:51,142 --> 00:26:52,507
A friend.

372
00:26:53,878 --> 00:26:55,539
What kind of friend?

373
00:26:56,214 --> 00:26:57,943
He's a federal judge.

374
00:26:58,416 --> 00:27:00,281
Is that good enough for you?

375
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:05,745
Well, this tape is my brother's life
and mine.

376
00:27:06,358 --> 00:27:10,454
And consequently, I need a name.

377
00:27:11,196 --> 00:27:13,858
Judge Scott Warren.

378
00:27:14,265 --> 00:27:15,664
A lifetime appointee...

379
00:27:15,834 --> 00:27:19,031
...who was put on the bench
by President Mills.

380
00:27:19,204 --> 00:27:22,071
He has no job to lose,
no loyalty to Reynolds.

381
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,300
Wants to see her gone, just like us.

382
00:27:26,344 --> 00:27:28,710
Well, let's go.
I left my car over by the statue.

383
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,973
You were tailed, Mr. Green.

384
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:34,280
The judge comes to us.

385
00:27:34,452 --> 00:27:36,352
I'll set up the meeting.

386
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:38,646
Do you see my clothes?

387
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:42,657
Your brother made certain that anybody
who was tailing me is long gone.

388
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:44,988
And on top of that, I'm an asthmatic.

389
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:50,066
My inhaler is in my jacket pocket,
which Lincoln made me throw away.

390
00:27:50,368 --> 00:27:55,431
I'm okay now, but in about 10 minutes,
I'm gonna have a hard time breathing.

391
00:27:55,607 --> 00:28:01,603
I've got a spare in my glove box,
so could we please just get back to my car?

392
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:12,354
My car is just a few blocks away.

393
00:28:12,557 --> 00:28:15,458
-Albuterol, Cortizaide or prednizone?
-What?

394
00:28:15,627 --> 00:28:18,721
My mother was an asthmatic.

395
00:28:18,897 --> 00:28:22,355
-What do you use in your inhaler?
-What the hell difference does it make?

396
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:24,866
Just answer the question, please.

397
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:27,704
You're a real piece of work,
you know that?

398
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:29,737
How many times
I gotta prove myself to you?

399
00:28:29,908 --> 00:28:31,375
Just one.

400
00:28:35,413 --> 00:28:38,348
Fine. Cortizaide.

401
00:28:40,618 --> 00:28:43,314
I'm sorry, it's just....

402
00:28:44,089 --> 00:28:45,317
If you knew what--

403
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:47,287
If you knew what we'd been through.

404
00:28:48,126 --> 00:28:49,423
I understand.

405
00:28:49,594 --> 00:28:52,757
-Can we now just please go to my car?
-Yeah.

406
00:29:08,012 --> 00:29:11,504
<i>A one-way ticket to Bangkok,
s'il vous plait.</i>

407
00:29:11,983 --> 00:29:13,143
Oh, I'm sorry.

408
00:29:14,486 --> 00:29:17,046
We don't have anything until tomorrow.
Unless you don't mind...

409
00:29:17,222 --> 00:29:19,554
...taking a few connections
through Chicago?

410
00:29:19,724 --> 00:29:21,817
And there's one more international stop.

411
00:29:21,993 --> 00:29:23,290
Whatever leaves first.

412
00:29:23,461 --> 00:29:25,361
Okay. ID, please.

413
00:29:29,734 --> 00:29:31,531
Okay, Mr. Stammel?

414
00:29:31,703 --> 00:29:33,534
Oh, it's Dr. Stammel.

415
00:29:33,705 --> 00:29:36,401
-And thank you.
-All right. It'll be just a few minutes.

416
00:29:36,574 --> 00:29:40,374
-I'll check this bag for you.
-Oh, no. It's coming with me.

417
00:29:41,846 --> 00:29:45,577
Sir, I know that bag is way over
the weight limit for carryon.

418
00:29:45,984 --> 00:29:49,715
What difference does a few pounds make
on a 3-ton aircraft whether it's up above--?

419
00:29:49,888 --> 00:29:51,856
It's an FAA violation.

420
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:55,653
Sir, your bag will be safe.

421
00:30:09,073 --> 00:30:11,303
<i>Today will be a tough day for travelers
in the Windy City...</i>

422
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:15,742
<i>...as all streets in a six-block radius
of the Grand Carlisle Hotel...</i>

423
00:30:15,914 --> 00:30:18,075
<i>...have been closed to traffic
in anticipation...</i>

424
00:30:18,249 --> 00:30:21,480
<i>...of President Reynolds' speech there
this evening.</i>

425
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:24,554
<i>This will be one of several
Midwestern stops for the president...</i>

426
00:30:24,722 --> 00:30:27,748
<i>...as she ramps up her election campaign.</i>

427
00:30:27,926 --> 00:30:31,794
Hey, Theo, I know you're new, but we use
both sides of legal pads in this office, okay?

428
00:30:31,963 --> 00:30:33,487
Before we recycle, we reduce.

429
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:35,929
The Comanche used the entire buffalo.

430
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:37,590
So can we.

431
00:30:37,769 --> 00:30:40,033
Actually, majority of tribes
would farm land...

432
00:30:40,205 --> 00:30:43,174
...till it was stripped of its fertility,
then they'd just move on.

433
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:48,278
The Indian as conservationist is a myth
created by white liberal guilt.

434
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:52,347
-Paul.
-Hi, Kristine.

435
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:54,576
I'd hoped maybe I'd see you
at Dad's funeral.

436
00:30:55,053 --> 00:30:56,987
That man died
long before his heart stopped.

437
00:30:57,155 --> 00:30:59,020
That funeral was a formality.

438
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:01,522
-That's really not fair.
-It's true.

439
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:03,923
So you wanna know how Mom is?

440
00:31:04,095 --> 00:31:07,553
Someone spitting you out of their crotch
doesn't make them your mother.

441
00:31:07,732 --> 00:31:09,723
That woman is insane.

442
00:31:09,901 --> 00:31:11,835
Do you remember?
Have you suppressed it all?

443
00:31:12,003 --> 00:31:15,029
I know, Paul.
I was there every day, unlike you.

444
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:18,073
-I was there for 18 years.
-And then you just left.

445
00:31:18,243 --> 00:31:20,143
I was 10, Paul.

446
00:31:20,311 --> 00:31:24,304
You were all I had in the world,
and you just left me there.

447
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:28,318
I'm sorry.

448
00:31:30,855 --> 00:31:34,757
If I could've taken you with me, I would've,
and I've thought about you every day.

449
00:31:44,969 --> 00:31:46,960
I'm not the brother you remember.

450
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:49,533
I've changed...

451
00:31:49,841 --> 00:31:54,801
...in a really bad way.

452
00:31:56,748 --> 00:32:00,514
To the point where I don't know
what good or bad is anymore.

453
00:32:01,152 --> 00:32:05,145
And I am gonna do something,
I have to do something...

454
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:08,589
...that a lot of people
are gonna think is horrible.

455
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:12,161
-Paul.
-And you just remember...

456
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:14,993
...the brother you grew up with.

457
00:32:15,166 --> 00:32:17,225
Just remember him.

458
00:32:20,705 --> 00:32:24,300
You're my sister, Kristine. I love you.

459
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:34,877
I was out cold.
I don't know where they went.

460
00:32:35,053 --> 00:32:38,580
And it was their idea for you to meet them
here in the middle of Chicago?

461
00:32:39,357 --> 00:32:40,915
Yeah.

462
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:46,889
Oh, man.

463
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:56,402
-Mahone?
-You brought me in too late. They're gone.

464
00:32:58,676 --> 00:33:01,338
-Then find them.
-Let me get this straight.

465
00:33:01,512 --> 00:33:04,481
They come back to a city 15 miles
from the prison they escaped from.

466
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:05,877
Why would they do that?

467
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:09,577
Maybe because the president's in Chicago
to make a speech, they're up to something.

468
00:33:09,754 --> 00:33:11,381
Which is why we need to find them.

469
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:13,384
And of all people...

470
00:33:13,558 --> 00:33:16,186
...they wanna meet somebody
from the attorney general's office.

471
00:33:16,594 --> 00:33:17,891
Your point?

472
00:33:18,296 --> 00:33:21,459
Burrows is innocent.

473
00:33:21,632 --> 00:33:25,261
You're good, Alex, as advertised.

474
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:27,668
No one's truly innocent.

475
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:30,205
<i>You, of all people, should know that.</i>

476
00:33:35,446 --> 00:33:39,212
It must've been the receptionist.
She's the only one I spoke to.

477
00:33:52,397 --> 00:33:54,524
Michael Scofield, Cooper Green.

478
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:55,184
We gotta get as much of that in as possible
before the baby gets here.

479
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:57,054
Why?

480
00:34:57,795 --> 00:34:59,422
Because.

481
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:03,590
Once the baby's growing in there,
doesn't it just get kind of wrong?

482
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:06,031
Oh, yeah.

483
00:35:11,209 --> 00:35:12,801
-What?
-I just felt the baby move.

484
00:35:12,977 --> 00:35:16,174
-No, Fernando, that's impossible.
-I know what I just felt.

485
00:35:17,315 --> 00:35:20,216
Well, the doctor did say
that he can become active...

486
00:35:20,384 --> 00:35:22,284
...after certain activities.

487
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:29,316
-Did you feel that?
-Yeah, like a flutter?

488
00:35:29,494 --> 00:35:31,291
Flutter, my ass. He's strong.

489
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:33,896
He's gonna be the captain
of the national soccer team.

490
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:36,666
You hear that, junior?

491
00:35:36,834 --> 00:35:39,530
Soon as you're born,
I'm putting a soccer ball in your hands.

492
00:35:39,704 --> 00:35:42,036
No, he's gonna have books.

493
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:44,139
Fine.

494
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:46,003
Books about soccer.

495
00:35:49,514 --> 00:35:51,379
Hey, baby.

496
00:35:51,549 --> 00:35:54,177
I told you
everything was gonna work out.

497
00:35:54,552 --> 00:35:56,645
We're out in the middle of nowhere.

498
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:58,584
The baby's doing great.

499
00:35:59,423 --> 00:36:01,721
Everything's gonna be perfect.

500
00:36:02,793 --> 00:36:04,021
<i>Your attention, please.</i>

501
00:36:04,195 --> 00:36:06,720
<i>It looks like we've got nothing
but smooth skies ahead...</i>

502
00:36:06,898 --> 00:36:08,695
<i>...so we should be arriving in Mejico....</i>

503
00:36:08,866 --> 00:36:12,324
Excuse me, when is the meal coming?
I'm starved.

504
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:14,300
As a way to keep ticket prices low...

505
00:36:14,472 --> 00:36:16,997
...we removed in-flight meals
from our service package.

506
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:19,609
Well, what's left on the service package?

507
00:36:19,777 --> 00:36:22,678
Pretzels and bags of Krispity Krunch.

508
00:36:22,914 --> 00:36:24,643
Pretzels.

509
00:36:24,982 --> 00:36:27,507
Just a few minutes.

510
00:36:31,122 --> 00:36:33,454
Freshen me up
when you get a chance, darling.

511
00:36:34,158 --> 00:36:36,023
Right away, Dr. Stammel.

512
00:36:41,566 --> 00:36:43,830
Dede's doing real good.

513
00:36:44,001 --> 00:36:48,028
Responding to the meds, eating.

514
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,338
She's gonna be okay.

515
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:56,941
Because of you.

516
00:36:57,848 --> 00:37:01,750
-She's gonna be okay because of you.
-Yeah.

517
00:37:03,521 --> 00:37:05,489
I need to know...

518
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:10,053
...you know, that you forgive me.

519
00:37:10,361 --> 00:37:13,592
I know that. Of course I forgive you.

520
00:37:13,764 --> 00:37:18,963
You know, when Dede was like 4,
she wanted to watch this video.

521
00:37:19,136 --> 00:37:21,263
And I kept telling her,
you know, after the game.

522
00:37:21,439 --> 00:37:23,634
After the game, okay?

523
00:37:23,808 --> 00:37:27,369
She kept asking and kept asking.
I lost my patience and I snapped at her.

524
00:37:27,545 --> 00:37:28,910
I snapped at her real bad.

525
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:32,607
Well, she went over into the corner...

526
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:37,144
...and I didn't even go over
and say anything.

527
00:37:37,321 --> 00:37:38,982
Why are you getting yourself upset...

528
00:37:39,156 --> 00:37:42,853
...over something that happened years ago,
baby, years ago? Dede loves you.

529
00:37:43,027 --> 00:37:48,522
I want you to do something for me.
I want you to tell her that I'm sorry.

530
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:52,465
I'm so sorry. And that my baby girl
means everything to me.

531
00:37:52,637 --> 00:37:56,198
I want you to tell her
that she means everything to me, okay?

532
00:37:56,374 --> 00:37:57,773
You tell her that every day.

533
00:37:58,175 --> 00:37:59,540
-Time.
-No matter what.

534
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:01,803
-Ma'am.
-Tell her.

535
00:38:01,979 --> 00:38:05,142
Tell her, okay?
No matter what, he loves her, okay?

536
00:38:05,316 --> 00:38:08,012
-Ma'am.
-Please. Please, you gotta tell her.

537
00:38:08,185 --> 00:38:11,211
-You have to tell her....
-Okay, okay, okay.

538
00:38:11,389 --> 00:38:15,689
-Ma'am, you really have to go.
-Tell her that her daddy loves her.

539
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:34,378
Attention, attention.

540
00:38:34,879 --> 00:38:39,578
All spectators must remain
behind the barricade at all times.

541
00:38:46,524 --> 00:38:49,755
We got a Boom Charlie half a block south.
Team leader wants you there.

542
00:38:49,927 --> 00:38:52,191
-What's the M.O.?
-He's got an I.E.D. strapped to--

543
00:38:58,969 --> 00:39:01,494
He asked you to come
to this fountain specifically?

544
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:03,139
Yeah.

545
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:08,509
Let me take a look at that park map.

546
00:39:11,782 --> 00:39:14,012
Why not the fountain
on the east side of the park?

547
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:16,847
Because this was closer
to the payphone they called me at.

548
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:18,852
No, because this one's closer to them.

549
00:39:19,156 --> 00:39:23,092
They tell you to meet them at the statue,
then the fountain...

550
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:26,093
...then they send you
to the building across the park.

551
00:39:26,497 --> 00:39:28,089
Why?

552
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,293
Because they wanna keep you
in their sights.

553
00:39:31,469 --> 00:39:33,733
Because they're watching you.

554
00:39:35,072 --> 00:39:38,200
But from where?
The statue, fountain, building.

555
00:39:41,479 --> 00:39:44,312
There. The hotel.

556
00:39:47,184 --> 00:39:48,617
You know what you have?

557
00:39:48,786 --> 00:39:52,085
-I think we have a pretty good idea.
-What you doing?

558
00:39:52,256 --> 00:39:56,352
Getting unique data from the memory key
so we can identify this key from any other...

559
00:39:56,527 --> 00:39:59,462
...label it, start a proper record
of the chain of custody...

560
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:01,655
...to present to the judges I trust.

561
00:40:01,832 --> 00:40:03,322
Cool.

562
00:40:07,104 --> 00:40:09,971
-No.
-What's wrong?

563
00:40:10,141 --> 00:40:12,405
No, it's the date stamp
on the memory key.

564
00:40:12,943 --> 00:40:14,570
It's the copy date.

565
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:17,680
-I'm sorry, what's that?
-It's the date the damn thing was copied.

566
00:40:17,848 --> 00:40:20,578
Not the date that the conversation
was originally recorded.

567
00:40:20,951 --> 00:40:23,852
So what? I mean,
you heard what was on the tape.

568
00:40:24,021 --> 00:40:28,856
Without a time stamp of exactly
when this conversation took place...

569
00:40:29,026 --> 00:40:31,620
...we can't prove
that this is Terrence Steadman talking...

570
00:40:31,796 --> 00:40:33,957
...after you supposedly killed him.

571
00:40:34,131 --> 00:40:36,861
This could've happened
a year before his funeral.

572
00:40:37,034 --> 00:40:38,467
No, it can't be authenticated...

573
00:40:38,636 --> 00:40:42,299
...so it can't be admitted
to any court as evidence.

574
00:40:42,473 --> 00:40:45,499
People died because of this.
My family died.

575
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:47,171
I'm sorry.

576
00:40:49,313 --> 00:40:52,214
Legally speaking, this tape is useless.

577
00:40:58,856 --> 00:41:00,756
-Hi.
-Alexander Mahone, FBI.

578
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:04,019
Have either of these men checked in?

579
00:41:04,528 --> 00:41:06,826
-Not that I've seen.
-How about this woman?

580
00:41:08,766 --> 00:41:10,393
Yeah.

581
00:41:12,536 --> 00:41:14,003
Room 1006.

582
00:41:14,171 --> 00:41:15,900
Ten-o-six. Ten-o-six. Thank you.

583
00:41:19,877 --> 00:41:21,811
It's not over. We're this close.

584
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:23,708
You've already said it's done.

585
00:41:23,881 --> 00:41:27,339
Actually, I said it couldn't help
exonerate you in a court of law.

586
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:31,049
Maybe it can help you outside the law.

587
00:41:31,422 --> 00:41:32,650
How?

588
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:34,688
Well, we all heard the conversation.

589
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:38,928
There's more to this tape
than potential proof of Lincoln's innocence.

590
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:42,222
There is proof of Caroline Reynolds' guilt.

591
00:41:42,399 --> 00:41:46,358
Guilt about something she does not want
anyone to know anything about.

592
00:41:46,604 --> 00:41:48,401
So we blackmail her.

593
00:41:50,674 --> 00:41:53,336
I'm an officer of the court.
I didn't say that.

594
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:55,479
Blackmail in exchange for what?

595
00:41:57,515 --> 00:41:59,676
A presidential pardon.

596
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:04,253
So the woman that set me up
is gonna set me free.

597
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:08,017
I think she'll sign it with her own hand.

598
00:42:10,828 --> 00:42:13,296
<i>Ace Team, Beta Team, this is Leader One.</i>

599
00:42:13,464 --> 00:42:15,864
All spectators must remain
behind the barricade.

600
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:18,325
The president will be arriving shortly.

601
00:42:18,502 --> 00:42:22,029
<i>The president will reach Home Base
in T-minus 2 minutes.</i>

602
00:42:44,328 --> 00:42:46,421
I love you.
