我和你有个很大不同 迈克尔

你不会杀人

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:10,850
我会逮到你
I will get you.

00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:14,320
这个 呃... 万一你遇到麻烦
This is, uh...in case you run into trouble down the road.

6
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:16,020
沿着这路走

7
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:18,390
林肯 你父亲真的很想见见你弟弟和你

他在你弟弟十岁后就没见过他
He hasn't seen Michael since he was ten years old.

9
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:22,420
我们走
Let's go!

10
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:23,950
迈克尔从未见过你爷爷

爸爸

00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:27,490
-我找到布伦斯了-干掉他们

13
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,990
我想我有点享受这件事
I think there's a part of me that enjoys this.

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,490
感觉好像在追吸毒一样的快感
It feels to me like chasing a high.

15
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,650
现在我更了解状况了
And I should know better by now.

16
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:38,930

00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,320

00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:48,020
这是... 量血压的
It's for my... blood pressure.

20
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:50,650
-盖瑞 我们可以做笔交易 好吗?-不行
-Geary, come on, we can make a deal, man.-No deals.

21
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:53,020
你最后的筹码都用完了 伙计
You just crapped out your last bargaining chip, pal.

22
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:57,100
这难道不是你所见过最美的东西吗?
Ain't that the most beautiful thing you ever seen?

23
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:21,500
我们是警察

24
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:28,990
我们是警察
This is the Tribune Police.

拿走吧 请不要伤害我
Just take it; please don't hurt me.

43
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,100
求你了
Please.

44
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:12,120
你要付出代价的
You have to pay for that.

45
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:13,450
打开抽屉
vault.Open it.

46
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:16,760
为了大家
One for the team.

47
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:23,220
他不是在追捕我 而是我女儿
He wasn't gunning for me,he was gunning for my daughter.

48
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:27,600
告诉安娜我爱她
Give Anna her papa's love.

49
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:31,650
我会把你的喉咙给割断
I'm going cut your throat out.

50
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:33,390
我爱过你 迈克尔
I loved you, Michael.

51
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,590
你却利用了我
You just used me.

52
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,190
警察发现了你女友
Cops found your girlfriend fish-belly white,

53
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:39,220
脸色惨白  口吐白沫
gargling her own puke.

54
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:40,290
反正你不会关心
And what do you care?

55
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:44,330
只要她把那门开着就得了
As long as she left the door open.

56
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:48,050
能遇上你我感到很幸运
I feel very fortunate to have met you.

57
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,960
对不起 亨利
I'm sorry, Henry.

58
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:14,550
掌握政府是为了公司的利益
It's about corporate interests taking over the government--

59
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,850
买到选票 打仗
buying elections, fighting wars...

60
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:20,490
有人会死 他们从而得利
people dying so they can turn a profit.

61
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,590
我们想要阻止这些
We're trying to stop it.

62
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,450
那你们是什么 一大堆间谍?
What are you, a bunch of spies?

63
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:27,890
仅仅是一些议员和国会里的人
Just a handful of senators, congressmen,

64
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,550
以及像我那样曾经为公司出过力的人
people like me that once worked for the company.

65
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,350
人们想要揭露总统
People willing to expose

66
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,220
揭开他的本来面目--
the president for what she is--

67
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:36,020
一个公司抛出去的诱饵
a shill working for these corporations.

68
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:37,150
我们要拉她下台
We bring her down,

69
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,820
要击垮他们
we bring them down.

70
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:40,620
这和我有什么关系?
What's it got to do with me?

71
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:43,890
因为我们拉她下台的办法就是让你获得自由的办法
Because the way we're going to bring her down is....

72
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:46,720
大约一礼拜前 我们终于取得了突破
About a week ago, we finally got a break.

73
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:50,190
一位国家安全局的分析师同意了我们的计划
An nsa analyst sympathetic

74
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:56,350
他最终想办法进入并弄明白了那个梯次程序
to our cause finally worked his way up and got clearance into the Echelon program.

75
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,990
全国各地的电子邮件以及电话
E-mails, cell phone calls all across this country,

76
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,550
只要被传送 就会通过那个梯次程序
if it's transmitted, it goes through Echelon.

77
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,020
会被分类 翻译 并且储存下来
It's calogued, interpreted,and then stored

78
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:05,690
为了国家的安全
for homeland security.

79
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,450
他们什么都不会放过
Nothing is missed by them.

80
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:08,920
任何一切
Nothing.

81
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:11,550
包括 一次偶然的机会
Including, by accident,

82
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:14,590
在9-11后几个月...
for a few months after 9-11...

83
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,520
白宫
the white house.

84
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:22,590
那分析师监听到了总统和特伦斯・斯蒂德曼的电话
The analyst got his hands on a phone conversation the president had with ...

85
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,550
两周以后
two weeks after

86
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,300
就会安排你杀了他
you supposedly killed him.

87
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:34,130
后来 那分析师想要把这情报带出来
Now, the analyst tried to get this information out of the building...

88
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:36,820
...但后来发现有其他人也在监听
but it turns out, someone else was snooping, too.

89
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:39,820
(想知道真相就打开)
If you really want to know

90
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:45,230
某些其他人 想要知道总统的一些事
Someone else wanted answers about the president.

91
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:50,650
艾尔多和林肯想要单独待着
Aldo and Lincoln want to be left alone.

92
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:53,300
当然了 我明白
Sure, I understand.

93
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:59,250
24小时后 唐克雷蒂州长死了
24 hours later, tancredi is dead,

94
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:00,320
那分析师也失踪了
the analyst is missing,

95
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:05,830
而且白宫的梯次程序录音带也从主机上被删了
and the white house Echelon tapes have been deleted from the mainframe.

96
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:09,590
那卷录音应该还在
The tape is still out there.

97
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,790
想想他们对唐克雷蒂・莎拉追的那么紧
And judging by how hard they're going after Sara tancredi,

98
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,990
我很肯定他们认为录音带就在她那
I'm pretty sure they think she has it.

99
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,990
而且我想他们是对的
And I think they're right.

100
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,890
她是整件事的关键
She's the key to this whole thing,

101
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:23,860
林肯
Lincoln.

102
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,200
LJ  跟我来
LJ, COME WITH ME.

103
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:45,460
我知道你现在觉得被背叛了
I would imagine that you're feeling slightly betrayed right now.

104
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:50,100
我明白
I understand.

105
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:59,350
你也该知道了
As you can see,

106
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:04,030
我不叫兰斯 也不是个吸毒者
hi, my name is not lance,and I'm not an addict.

107
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:06,150
好吧
okay.

108
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:10,320
现在我有件事对你来说很重要
There is one thing about me that should mean a great deal to you right now.

109
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:12,550
那就是我是一个通情达理的人
That is I am reasonable.

110
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,450
只要你告诉我你所知道的 我就放你走
If you tell me what you know, you get to go.

111
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:16,890
好吧 或许
Okay, and then maybe

112
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:18,190
考虑到我们之间的关系
when this is all behind us,

113
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:21,090
你应该想一想我们以前的老交情
we get to grab a piece of pie for old times' sake.

114
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:24,330
好吗
Okay.

115
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:31,050
我不知道迈克尔在哪
I don't know where Michael is.

116
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:34,290
这和迈克尔无关 是关于你父亲的
This is not about Michael; this is about your father.

117
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,550
他在华盛顿留了些东西
He left washington with

118
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,120
一些不属于他的东西
something that didn't belong to him.

119
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:38,620
我们想要回来
We need it back.

120
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:39,720
就为了这你杀了他?
And you killed him for it.

121
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:44,220
不 我没有 这不值得我这么做
I didn't, no, for what that's worth.

122
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:46,550
但我也希望他的死
But I hope that his death

123
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:52,060
让你清楚地明白了现在的状况
properly illustrates the magnitude of the situation that we're in right now.

124
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:56,320
东西在哪?
Sowhere is it?

125
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:58,750
我不知道你说什么
I don't know what you're talking about.

126
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,020
在哪?
Where is it?

127
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:02,320
我不知道你在说什么
I don't know what you're talking about.

128
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:03,720
在哪?
Where is it?

129
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:06,490
我不知道你在说什么
I don't know what you're talking about.

130
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:09,690
莎拉 对这事我还有进一步的办法
Sara, there's a next step involved in this,

131
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:14,860
你一定不会想尝尝的
and you don't want to experience that.

132
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:19,750
我向天发誓 我真的不知道你说什么
I swear to god I don't know what you're talking about.

133
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:23,390
我爸爸没给我任何东西
My father didn't give me anything.

134
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:28,100
我真的不知道你在说什么
I don't know what you're talking about.

135
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:52,490
保佑我神父  我有罪
bless me, father, for I have sinned.

136
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,490
你上一次忏悔是什么时候?
How long has it been since your last confession?

137
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,220
这是第一次
This is my first time.

138
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:58,390
有生以来
In a long time.

139
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:02,090
你知道你的罪行的本质吗?
Are you aware of the nature of your sins?

140
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:05,930
本质?
The nature?

141
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:08,990
我不太确定
I'm not really sure.

142
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,930
在你内心深处你是知道的
Deep down inside your heart, you know.

143
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:16,590
也许是正义的吧
Righteousness, maybe.

144
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,190
相信到最后能为我的所做所为正名
Believing the ends justify the means.

145
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,250
你的最后目的是什么？
What are those ends?

146
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:23,890
拯救一个人的生命
Saving someone's life.

147
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:26,050
那你的所做所为呢?
And the means?

148
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:31,220
我几乎破坏了所有的法律
I've broken just about every law you can name.

149
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:34,660
但这不仅仅是我所做过的事...
But it's not just what I've done.

150
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:38,350
还有其他人做的事...
It's what others have done...

151
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:41,820
...因为是我让他们做的
because I let them.

152
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:43,950
因为我觉得自己在做正确的事
Because I was doing what I thought was right.

153
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,890
本来这次我应该更明白的...
I should have known better this time.

154
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:48,800
这次?
This time?

155
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:55,100
当我还是个孩子的时候...
When I was a kid...

156
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:59,260
我眼看着一个人流血致死
I watched a man bleed out and die.

157
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,490
而且我很高兴...
And I was glad...

158
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,920
因为这是他应得的
because he deserved it.

159
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:07,120
生命
Life

160
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:09,820
-是只有上帝才有权赋予或者带走的  孩子-突然间
is only for god to give and take, my son.-Suddenly,

161
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:13,920
在我内心就有了阴影
there is this dark space inside of me.

162
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:17,060
我知道那是不对的
And I knew it was wrong.

163
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:19,450
但事已至此
But here I am.

164
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:21,020
有办法来挽回的
There is a way to stop this.

165
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:23,620
把你的意志交给上帝
Surrender your will to god.

166
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:26,520
如果我现在放弃
If I surrender now,

167
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:29,290
我会失去我所爱的一切
I lose everything that I love.

168
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:35,360
会失去你的灵魂吗?
But do you lose your soul in the process?

169
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:42,700
人人都有自己的信仰
Well, we all have our crosses to bear.

170
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:49,060
你还好吗?
You okay?

171
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:51,250
这永远都不会停止
This is never gonna stop.

172
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:54,200
他们会不断来追杀我们
They're gna keep coming after us.

173
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:13,100
林肯  别接
Lincoln, don'T.

174
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,890
搞定了吗?
Is it done?

175
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:19,060
你完了
You are.

176
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,590
林肯 布伦斯
Lincoln Burrows.

177
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,220
你的人死了
Your man's dead.

178
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:26,850
和你派来杀我儿子的其他人一个下场
Just like anyone else you send to take out my son.

179
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:28,950
我们要的是你
We want you.

180
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:32,150
和LJ没关系
This isn't about LJ.

181
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,820
有个很简单的办法
There's a very simple way

182
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:34,920
让这一切都结束
for all of this to end.

183
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:36,450
我来告诉你这会怎么结束--
I'll tell you how it's going to end--

184
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:40,100
我会亲手掐死你
me staring in your dead eye with my hand around your throat.

185
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:43,400
你都不知道我是谁
You don't even know who I am.

186
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:53,090
还有多远?
How much further?

187
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:58,600
17号国道 墨西哥边境以北75英里处
COUNTY ROAD 17  75 MILES NORTH OF THE MEXICAN BORDER

188
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:05,400
就这里吧
Right here is good.Alright you got it.

189
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:12,890
谢了
Thanks for the ride.

190
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:15,100
小意思
No problem.

191
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:22,950
马宏探员
Agent Mahone.

192
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,950
我是比尔 金
Bill Kim.

193
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,420
是来接你的
I'm here to pick you up.

194
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:30,250
我叫的是克里曼
I called Kellerman.

195
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:33,590
他现在忙着呢
He's busy right now.

196
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,690
有别人知道你在这里吗?
Does anyone else know you're here?

197
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,350
-没有-那就好
-No.-Good.

198
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,250
你能把门打开吗?
Can you open the gate?

199
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:43,420
我还需要辆车
And I need a new vehicle.

200
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:45,320
我想你还不够了解我
There's something you should know about me.

201
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:47,450
我不太喜欢直接参与到行动中
I don't like being out in the field.

202
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:51,360
只有出了茬子我才会来
I only do so when there's been a screwup.

203
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:54,420
我现在也参与了  亚历山大
I'm out in the field, Alex.

204
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:55,950
那么你为什么不把门打开?
Then why don't you open the gate?

205
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,490
然后就赶快回华盛顿去
You can hurry back to D.C.

206
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:00,490
免得把鞋弄脏了
before your shoes get dirty.

207
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,120
我们有个线索可以知道林肯
We have a lead as to where Burrows

208
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:03,420
和他弟弟碰头的地点
will be meeting up with his brother.

209
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:05,650
一个他叫波茨瓦波什的地方
It's a place he referred to as "Bolshoi Booze."

210
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:07,520
你知道那个地方吗?
Does that mean anything to you?

211
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:09,750
是的  那是斯科菲尔德身上的一百多个纹身之一
Yeah, it's one of a hundred tattoos on Scofield's body.

212
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,290
是什么意思?
What does it mean?

213
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,590
我现在还不知道
I don't know yet.

214
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,850
你必须要在接下来的
You'll need to figure it out

215
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:15,050
几个小时里面破解出来
within the next couple of hours.

216
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:16,690
如果斯科菲尔德和布伦斯越过了边境
If Scofield and Burrows cross the border,

217
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:17,990
他们就在你的司法权之外了
they'll be out of your jurisdiction,

218
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,900
你对我们也就没价值了
and you'll be of no further value to us.

219
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:25,290
开门
Open the gate.

220
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:27,590
然后你能做什么?
So you can do what?

221
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,290
我想先听听
I want to hear it.

222
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,790
这位本来指望着帮我们结案的人打算怎么做
Straight from the mouth of the guy who's supposed to be our closer.

223
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,820
我会抓住斯科菲尔德
I'll get Scofield

224
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:35,790
和布伦斯...还有剩下的人
and Burrows...and all of the rest of them.

225
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,320
之后你和我
And then me and you

226
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:39,790
还有凯勒曼
and Kellerman,

227
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,550
各走各的路
we're going to part ways.

228
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:45,760
我只希望你动机明确
I just hope you're properly motivated.

229
00:16:55,400 --> 00:17:01,600
因为只要你尽职了 我们就不会记起查尔斯的事
'Cause as long as you do your job, we'll forget about Shales.

230
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:05,320
然后你就能回科罗拉多去见你的儿子
And then you can go back to Colorado and visit your son.

231
00:17:05,330 --> 00:17:06,790
卡麦隆
Cameron.

232
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:10,030
他五岁了  是吧?
He's five, right?

233
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:14,620
不许你再提起他的名字
Don't you ever mention his name again.

234
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:17,490
这就对了
There he is.

235
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:21,430
这就是我想听的
That's what I wanted to hear.

236
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,550
去破解它  亚历山大
Get cracking, Alex.

237
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:31,600
好多人就指望着你了
A lot of people are relying on you.

238
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:40,750
珍妮会照顾好的  你可以信任她
Jane will take care of it; you can trust her.

239
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,690
我知道这很不容易
I know this is hard,

240
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:46,900
但是会好起来的  相信我
but it will work out--you have my word.

241
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:50,900
-谢谢-多加小心
-Thank you.-Be careful.

242
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:02,590
听着  恩...
Listen, uh...

243
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:06,150
我明白
I know.

244
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,390
珍妮会照顾你的
Jane's gonna look after you.

245
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,990
我都不认识她
I don't even know her.

246
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,120
她没问题的
She's all right.

247
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:13,120
她为爸爸做事已经有段时间了
She's been working for Dad for a while.

248
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:17,230
我会...
I'll, uh...

249
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,830
我很快就会见到你的  我保证...
I'll see you soon, I promise.

250
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,290
是不是你爸爸也这么跟你说过?
Isn't that the same thing your dad told you?

251
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:26,960
是的  但我说话算话
Yeah, but I mean it.

252
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:02,250
是我
Hey.Hey, it's me.

253
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:04,390
收到给我打个电话好吗?
Just call me when you get this, okay?

254
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,760
有要紧事
It's important.

255
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:45,160
这是数字
the numbers...

256
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:42,460
这个是我的报酬吗？
Is that my payment?

257
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:44,690
医用硝化甘油
Medical nitroglycerine?

258
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:47,760
我答应过你的
As promised.

259
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:58,820
你可不了解要弄到这样的货色有多难
You have no idea how hard it is to get this kind of grade.

260
00:21:58,830 --> 00:21:59,920
就算利用我的关系也未必可以
Even with my contacts.

261
00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:01,820
那么该是你实现交易的时候了
It's time for your end of the deal.

262
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:03,690
飞机在哪里？
Where's that plane gonna be?

263
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:08,550
降落前几小时他们会打电话告诉我地点的
They call me a couple of hours before with the drop-off point.

264
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,350
为了甩掉药品管理局的追踪
It keeps the DEA off our backs.

265
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:12,090
既然还有一会时间
Since it's going to be a while,

266
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:14,550
进去避避太阳吧
you might want to stay out of the sun.

267
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:17,800
(西班牙语)

268
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:27,450
有问题吗？
Is there a problem?

269
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:31,300
他们是我的表兄弟
They're my cousins.

270
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:44,220
在你父亲得到消息之前
Now, after your father accessed

271
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:46,960
他用手机打了3个电话
this information, he made three calls from his cell phone,

272
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:49,920
全都是给你的
all to you.

273
00:22:49,930 --> 00:22:51,850
他告诉了你什么？
What did he tell you?

274
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:53,790
他刚从芝加哥回来
Just that he was coming back to Chicago.

275
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,390
好
Good.

276
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,020
你现在变老实了 很好
You're being honest. Good.

277
00:22:57,030 --> 00:23:00,250
在你父亲飞机降落和你到家的时候
Now, there's a half an hour between when your father landed

278
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:02,950
有半个小时的间隔 我不清楚
and when he got home that is unaccounted for.

279
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,520
我知道你曾在他办公室停留过
I know you stopped by his office.

280
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:07,050
-你见到了他吗？-没有
-Did you see him there?-No.

281
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:09,690
我最后次见他是在书房 但是已经死了
The last time I saw my father,he was dead in his study.

282
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:12,050
他让其他人给你任何消息了吗?
Did your father have anyone give you anything?

283
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:13,390
你认为我会隐瞒你什么吗？
Do you think that I'm just withholding information

284
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,750
因为我喜欢和你在一起
because I like hanging out with you?

285
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:15,920
所以如果我知道什么事情
If I knew something,

286
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:17,320
我会告诉你的  但是我不知道
I would tell you; I don't.

287
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:19,450
我对此一无所知
I don't know anything about any of this.

288
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:20,490
真的?
Really?

289
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,590
那么为什么你会给他
Then why did you give your father the file

290
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,150
关于林肯布伦斯的资料
on Lincoln Burrows?

291
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,990
为什么你会为斯科菲尔德开门
Why did you open the door for Scofield,

292
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,650
帮他逃出监狱
and help him escape?

293
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:29,590
为什么他寄给你这些密笺?
Why did Scofield send you those coded notes?

294
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:34,160
为什么你会来新墨西哥见他?
Why did you come to New Mexico to meet him?

295
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,820
别和我耍花样
Don't try to float a babe-in-the-woods routine by me.

296
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:40,320
你这样会让我很生气 那么...
It's really going to piss me off, so...

297
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:43,860
说吧
Come on.

298
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:05,630
没事的
You're okay.

299
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:14,890
听着 莎拉
Look, Sara.

300
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:19,400
你知道  我们正在达成共识  对吧
We're going to have to come to an understanding.

301
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:30,550
是的 你是对的 他们是预谋好的
Yeah, you were right;they are coordinates.

302
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,890
在GPS上定好他们的坐标
Plug them into your GPS.

303
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:33,650
他们会带你去一个地方
They'll take you to a spot in the New Mexico desert.

304
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:36,420
大概在沙漠的某个中心
It's in the middle of nowhere, basically.

305
00:24:36,430 --> 00:24:37,520
谢谢
Thanks.

306
00:24:37,530 --> 00:24:38,690
好的 没问题
Yeah, no problem.

307
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:42,020
长官  你在和谁见面?
Sir, who are you meeting?

308
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:43,450
他究竟在干什么?
What the hell is he doing?

309
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:48,430
让我们别插手  他就在干这个
He's keeping us out of the loop,that's what he's doing.

310
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:51,720
多次逃过了法律的制裁
Constantly running from the law with a bad heart...

311
00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:54,020
墨西哥  我的故乡 有许多好东西
Mexico, where I'm from has got a lot of great things,

312
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:57,290
但是...没有好的医疗条件
but... health care ain't one of them.

313
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:59,220
你还好吧?
You all right?

314
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:00,950
你有点紧张
You look a little nervous.

315
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,120
我可不是天天都干这个的
I don't do this every day.

316
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:04,750
我想知道关于这架飞机
I just want to get the information on that plane

317
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,090
还有
and, uh...

318
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:08,020
继续上路
move on.

319
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:09,320
就这样？
Is that it?

320
00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:10,990
就这样
Is that it?

321
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,090
我知道你是谁
I know who you are.

322
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:16,250
你看上去有点紧张
You don't have to worry

323
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:17,950
我们不会和联邦探员有交易
we can't go within 100 feet of a federal marshal

324
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,390
去领奖赏的
to collect the reward,

325
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:22,990
因为我们的脑袋在美国和墨西哥都没有保障
'cause we got U.S. and Mexican warrants on our heads.

326
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,720
但是至于去巴拿马的飞机
But this plane to Panama...

327
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:29,930
坐下吧
Sit down.

328
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:37,120
这全都是为了你的哥哥?
This is all for your brother?

329
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:39,720
是的
Yes.

330
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:42,420
我有4个兄弟 2个在监狱
I got four brothers,two in prison.

331
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:44,150
帮个小忙?  没问题
Accept a call? Yes.

332
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:46,120
不过帮他们逃出来?  太疯狂了
But break them out? Loco.

333
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:48,690
我的哥哥给了我一个棒球手套
My brother gave me a baseball mitt

334
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:51,120
作为14岁的生日礼物
for my 14th birthday.

335
00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:52,990
所以 我欠他的
I owed him.

336
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,050
你这个作兄弟的比我好啊
You're a better man than I am.

337
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:58,130
让时间来见证吧
Time will tell.

338
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:08,890
他们到现在应该打电话来了吧
Shouldn't they have called by now...about the plane?

339
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,650
是的
Yeah.

340
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:14,920
但是  我有个问题
You know, I...I have a question.

341
00:26:14,930 --> 00:26:16,520
我想
I thought

342
00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:18,620
我觉得这些应该是玻璃管装
that these came in glass vials,

343
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:21,120
不是塑料装的
not plastic.

344
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:25,450
我也怀疑过 但是卖我的人说
I thought so, too, but the guy I bought it from said

345
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:27,220
就是用塑料管包装的
he packed it in plastic

346
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:30,250
再运输过程中防碎 防火
for transportation over long distances to prevent a fire

347
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:32,450
或者防爆炸
or an explosion.

348
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:34,750
真的?
Really?

349
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:37,900
怎么从来没有听过
I never heard of that.

350
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,990
怎么了
I never heard of that.

351
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,450
我们要做一些品质鉴定
We're going to do a little quality control test.

352
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:51,850
这是最好的现货
It's the best available.

353
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:55,460
我们不急
We got time.

354
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:29,750
上次 一些二十出头的黑人
For the last time,some black male, early 20s,

355
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,050
从我后面跳了出来
jumped me from behind.

356
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:32,920
我连他们的脸都没看清楚
I didn't get a good look at his face.

357
00:27:32,930 --> 00:27:34,490
凶手从背后袭击的你？
The assailant attacked you from behind?

358
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:35,920
就是这样
That's what I just said.

359
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:38,420
他试图攻击你的前额
Yet he managed to make contact square on your forehead.

360
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:39,650
对啊
That's right.

361
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:41,320
用什么敲的?回旋镖?
With what? A boomerang?

362
00:27:41,330 --> 00:27:43,150
别这样 告诉我到底发生了什么了
Come on, why don't you tell me what happened?

363
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:45,690
听着 我是一个退休的伊利诺斯州狱警
Look, I'm a retired correctional officer out of Illinois.

364
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:50,460
要不要展示下我的专业礼仪？ 宝贝
How about showing some professional courtesy, honey?

365
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,150
我是罗伊 格雷  请留言
This is Roy Geary.Leave a message.

366
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:02,420
你这个狗娘养的
You thieving son of a bitch.

367
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:04,190
最好跪下来
You better get down on your knees

368
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,820
向上帝祈祷别让我找到你
and pray to God that I don't find you,

369
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:07,520
如果你被我逮到
because, if I do,mark my words,

370
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:10,460
小心你的小命
I'm going to gut you bow to stern.

371
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:15,150
今天早上总统莱娜斯在佛罗里达州塔拉哈西市
President Reynolds was in Tallahassee, Florida,

372
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:18,850
参加了一个为正在重选的
early this morning, attending a $5,000-a-plate breakfast fund-raiser

373
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:22,890
参议员马丁 奎汉茨举行的筹款会
for senator martin kleinhenz,who's running for reelection.

374
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:25,350
今天下午  记者招待会被搅乱了
Later this afternoon, her press conference was derailed

375
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,290
一个记者要求评论
when a reporter asked her to comment

376
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:30,050
关于林肯逃狱的事情
on Lincoln Burrows'escape from custody.

377
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:31,450
她拒绝了
She declined.

378
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:33,520
这表明了在她上任一个月以来
It's become clear in her first month in office

379
00:28:33,530 --> 00:28:37,190
都不能脱离和这次猎捕行动的关系
that she cannot separate herself from this manhunt.

380
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,450
只要猎捕行动还在进行
And as long as it continues...

381
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:43,400
...专家们分析关于布伦斯的问题会继...
...pundits say that questions about Burrows will contin...

382
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,690
女士们
Ladies.

383
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:50,750
让我们开始狂欢吧
Let's get this party started.

384
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:53,250
在过去30年中我恨你
The last 30 years,I've hated you.

385
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:57,660
你抛弃了我
You walked out on me.

386
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:00,950
你都没有见过迈克尔
You haven't even seen Michael.

387
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:04,220
我见过了
I've seen him before.

388
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:07,150
不是在报纸上 爸爸
Not in the papers, Dad.

389
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:12,330
我一直在想什么样的男人会放弃家人
Been trying to work out what kind of man abandons his family.

390
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:17,200
现在我在做同样的事情
Now I'm doing the same damn thing.

391
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,020
你会见到他的
You'll see him again.

392
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:22,360
我保证
I'll make sure of it.

393
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:25,720
还要开多久
How much further?

394
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:28,700
3小时
About three hours.

395
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:36,020
还有几分钟了
It's gonna be a few minutes.

396
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:37,450
我的兄弟就到这里了
My brother should be here soon.

397
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:39,720
可能我应该出去 确保他能够看见我
Maybe I should go outside and make sure he can see me.

398
00:29:39,730 --> 00:29:40,890
好主意
That's a good idea.

399
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:42,350
我派伊内斯多去做
I think I'm gonna send Ernesto to do it.

400
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:46,360
(西班牙语)
Ernesto, por favor.

401
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:57,150
你好
Hello.

402
00:29:57,160 --> 00:30:03,830
(西班牙语)

403
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:10,020
是不是有消息了?
Was that the call?

404
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:11,490
是的
Yes, it was.

405
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:12,590
关于飞机的?
About the plane?

406
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:18,690
(西班牙语)

407
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:20,920
糖水
Sugar water.

408
00:30:20,930 --> 00:30:22,720
你犯了个大错误
You just made a big mistake,blanquito.

409
00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:24,450
对不起 对不起 好吗?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, okay?

410
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:25,750
我不是个化学家
I'm not a chemist.

411
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:29,020
卖给我的家伙发誓说是医用硝化甘油
The guy I bought it from swore it was medical nitro.

412
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:30,220
我们都被耍了
We both got screwed.

413
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:32,120
是的 但是只有一个人会付出代价
Yeah, but only one of us is gonna pay for it.

414
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:33,150
听着 我只想从这出去
Look, I just want to get out of here,

415
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,420
而你想得到你要的报酬
and you want your payment.

416
00:30:34,430 --> 00:30:35,850
我的兄弟很快就来了
My brother's gonna be here soon.

417
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:37,490
我们可以商量
We'll work something out.

418
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:39,920
出个价吧
Just name your price.

419
00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:42,790
我已经出价了
I already named my price.

420
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:45,200
但你没有兑现
You didn't go through.

421
00:30:56,030 --> 00:30:57,520
你的兄弟到底什么时候到
When's your brother getting here?

422
00:30:57,530 --> 00:31:01,090
你一直在盘算着利用我们  对不对
You were planning on turning us in the whole time, weren't you?

423
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:02,250
他什么时候能到
When's he supposed to meet you here?!

424
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:03,520
(西班牙语)

425
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:05,520
放下枪  否则我就开枪了
Drop it, or I'm gonna shoot him.

426
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:07,020
让他走  否则我就杀了你
Let him go, or I'll shoot you.

427
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:16,230
(西班牙语)

428
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:28,020
在哪?
Where is it?

429
00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:32,830
我爸爸没给我任何东西
My father didn't give me anything.

430
00:31:33,530 --> 00:31:36,600
你为了谁而拿自己的命冒险?
Who you risking your life for?

431
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:40,090
林肯 布伦斯吗?
Lincoln Burrows.

432
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:43,520
街头的暴徒而已
Street thug.

433
00:31:43,530 --> 00:31:44,750
你为什么会那么想?
And why is that your concern?

434
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:46,520
我是说 这难道是医生立下的誓言吗
I mean, is there somewhere in the Hippocratic Oath

435
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:50,890
所谓的 我保证会冒着生命危险去救毫不关心我的人
where it says,"I pledge to risk my life for those who don't care about mine"?

436
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:52,820
他们是不会关心你的生死的
'Cause they don't care about yours.

437
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:57,850
布伦斯和迈克尔 斯科菲尔德是在利用你
Burrows and Michael Scofield just used you.

438
00:31:57,860 --> 00:31:59,990
你是否感到很惊讶这个世界上还是有人会
Are you that surprised that there are people in the world

439
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,390
勇敢的抵抗像你这样的人?
who will stand up to people like you?

440
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,490
你连这都不知道吗?
Are you that far gone?

441
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:06,090
很可爱
That's cute.

442
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:08,320
真是悲哀啊
Sad.

443
00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:11,330
但很可爱
But cute.

444
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,250
克里夫兰什么?
A Cleveland what?

445
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:29,220
别担心  我会慢慢跟你说的
Don't worry,I'll talk you through it.

446
00:32:29,230 --> 00:32:34,200
我们这儿有张玻璃咖啡桌
And we got a glass coffee table right here.

447
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,450
才不干
Hell no.

448
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:37,260
给一千我就做
I'll do it for a thousand.

449
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:38,560
500$
500$

450
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,500
1000$
1000$

451
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:42,200
750$
750$

452
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:48,500
好吧
All right.

453
00:32:57,830 --> 00:33:02,000
什么鬼东西?
What the hell?

454
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:12,900
闪人
Leave.

455
00:33:15,130 --> 00:33:16,890
你知道
You know,

456
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:22,590
在军品店你能买到很多不可思议的东西
it's amazing what you can pick up at an Army-Navy store.

457
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:25,420
那些折磨你的手段都是贝利克的主意
All that torture stuff,that was Bellick's idea.

458
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:28,290
我也觉得他做的太过分了
And if you ask me, he took the whole thing way too far.

459
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:29,850
听着
Listen,

460
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:32,120
我分你一半钱  然后我们就此了解?
why don't I just give you half the money,and we call it a day?

461
00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:34,120
好吧  六四开
All right, 60-40.

462
00:33:34,130 --> 00:33:38,100
好吗 T 万事好商量
Come on, T,we can deal.

463
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,990
飞机会降落在哪儿?
Where's the plane going to land?

464
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,700
去死吧混蛋
Kiss my ass, cobarde.

465
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:53,620
我们该怎么做?
What are we going to do?

466
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:55,090
我也不知道
I don't know yet.

467
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:57,790
我们不能从地面穿越边境
We're not going to get across the border on the ground.

468
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,590
没飞机我们就完了
Without that plane,we're screwed.

469
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,090
他失血过多了
He's losing too much blood.

470
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:02,690
他这样活不下去的
He'll never make it like this.He should have thought

471
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:03,950
在他开枪打我们的时候就应该想明白的
of that before he tried to kill us.

472
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,220
我们必须要送他去医院
We got to take him to a hospital,

473
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:06,450
不然他会死的
or else he'll die.

474
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:09,460
求你了
Please.

475
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:13,190
告诉我飞机的事我就让你们走
The plane,and we'll let you go.

476
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:20,030
（西班牙语）

477
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:27,650
芬雷路...
Finley Road...

478
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:29,850
8号高速公路旁边有一个停机坪
off of Highway 8,there's an airstrip.

479
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:31,950
这样好了吧？快放了我们
There, okay?Now let us go.

480
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,550
-我们走吧!-别!别!不要!
-Let's go.-No, no, no!

481
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:35,020

484
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,520
别这样  求你了

我们走吧迈克尔
Let's go, Michael.

486
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:45,190
如果换了我们在流血
If we were bleeding

487
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:46,320
他才不会在乎
he would have not lifted a finger,

488
00:34:46,330 --> 00:34:48,090
你知道的  他会把我们俩都杀了
you know that--he was gonna kill us both.

489
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:49,650
-我们走吧-不  不会那样的
-Let's go.-No, that's not true.

490
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:52,020
迈克尔我们要去赶飞机了...
Michael, we're going to get to that plane...

491
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:53,050

求你别这样?!
Please don't do this, okay?!

494
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,520
（西班牙语） 别这样
Callate!Don't do this.

495
00:34:56,530 --> 00:34:57,790

别听他的!
Don't listen to him!

莎拉  我很在乎你的

499
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:11,100
这不是我情愿干的事  莎拉
This is not what I wanted, Sara.

500
00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:23,890
克里曼

501
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:25,790
莎拉那边情况怎么样了?
What's going on with Sara?

502
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:29,290
她和你交代什么了吗?
Has she told you anything?

503
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:30,920
哪儿也别去
Don't go anywhere.

504
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:32,420
还没
Not yet.

505
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:35,050
我想你是...用心劝导过她了

00:35:40,330 --> 00:35:43,900
可她是知道点事情
Well, she knows something.

509
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:47,320
违背我的命令  你就完了
You disobey me, you are done.

510
00:35:47,330 --> 00:35:50,100
明白了吗?
Do you understand me?

511
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,500
干掉她  保罗
Put her in the ground, Paul?

512
00:36:41,930 --> 00:36:43,990
迈克尔
Michael.

513
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,520

Let's go.

514
00:36:45,530 --> 00:36:47,420
-迈克尔-等等
-Michael.-Hold still.

515
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:50,050
迈克尔  这么做是个大错误  我们该快点离开
Michael, we're doing it wrong--let's get out of here.

516
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:51,490
现在他肯定会去报警
Now, he's gonna call the cops,

517
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,490
-或者去叫他的人来-他办不到的
or go get his buddies...He's not going to make it.

518
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:54,550
你必须要...别动！
You have to...Callate!

519
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,950
等安全了我们再打电话叫人帮他们

520
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:58,390
我们走  迈克尔  我们走!
Let's go-- Michael, let's go!

521

522
00:37:00,530 --> 00:37:02,590
你们必须马上送他去医院

525
00:37:18,730 --> 00:37:21,120

忘了芬雷路吧

The plane is going to stop at the seven mile marker

528
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:28,620
在日落的时候  4号公路

529
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:30,550
会停五分钟

然后它就会飞往

531
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,320
墨西哥的奥克萨卡
to Oaxaca, Mexico.

532
00:37:33,330 --> 00:37:37,760
要是错过了你麻烦就大了
If you miss it,you're out of luck.

533
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,550
在来的路上流血过多死了
He bled out on the way over.

534
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,650
能确认身份吗?
Any ID?

535
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:54,460
知道  罗伊 盖瑞  是个外地人
Yeah, Roy Geary,just an out-of-stater.

536
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,550
你认识他?
You know him?

537
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,290
是我一个朋友
He's a friend of mine.

538
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:07,750
贝利克先生?
Mr. Bellick?

539
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:11,720
怎么
Yeah.

540
00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:16,260
介意我再多问你几个问题吗?
You mind answering a few more questions?

541
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:22,850
是我
Yeah.

542
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:25,950
我是潘
It's Pam.

543
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:29,130
出什么事了?
What's going on?

544
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,320
只是想问个好
I just wanted to say hey.

545
00:38:31,330 --> 00:38:33,890
你没事吧?
Well... are you all right?

546
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:36,960
你说是要紧事
You said it was important.

547
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:41,920
我知道事情一直往糟糕的方向发展...
I know things got kind of ugly toward the...

548
00:38:41,930 --> 00:38:43,720
你知道的...一直到最后
you know, the end.

549
00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:47,150
恩...糟糕的其实是我自己
Um... I got ugly.

550
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:50,150
不过我想让你明白  在某些情况下
But I want you to know that,that there were circumstances

551
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:53,150
恩...
that, uh...

552
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:55,720
也许对你和卡麦隆来说
It was better that you and Cameron

553
00:38:55,730 --> 00:38:57,890
没和我在一起反而更好
that you were not with me.

554
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:00,750
为什么你现在跟我说这个?
Why are you telling me this now?

555
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:04,190
如果我有机会重头再来的话...
If I had to do it all over again...

556
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:08,650
我不会象当初那么做了
I'd do it different.

557
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:10,720
我们还会是一家人
We'd still be a family.

558
00:39:10,730 --> 00:39:15,460
为此我愿意付出一切
I'd give anything for that.

559
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:17,920
我只想让你知道
I just wanted you to know.

560
00:39:17,930 --> 00:39:18,920
亚力山大...
Alex...

561
00:39:18,930 --> 00:39:20,750
出什么事了?
what's going on?

562
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:21,950
没事
Nothing.

563
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:26,700
我只想打电话给你跟你说....
I just wanted to call to say that I was, uh....

564
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,890
...我很抱歉
...that I'm sorry

565
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:31,050
对这一切
about everything.

566
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:33,520
你现在在哪儿?
Where are you right now?

567
00:39:33,530 --> 00:39:35,150
我来找你
I can come get you.

568
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:36,520
那可真温馨  是吧?
Wouldn't that be nice, huh?

569
00:39:36,530 --> 00:39:38,820
我是认真的  你在哪儿?
No, I'm serious.Where are you?

570
00:39:38,830 --> 00:39:41,420
还有件事
One more thing.

571
00:39:41,430 --> 00:39:43,790
如果你在媒体上听到什么...
If you hear anything in the media...

572
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,850
什么?
What?

573
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:49,860
你在说什么?
What are you talking about?

574
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:54,250
我爱你
I love you,

575
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:58,360
替我吻下卡麦隆好吗?
and give Cameron a kiss for me okay?

576
00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:45,490
我很高兴当初跟你说了这地方
Well... I'm glad I told you about this place.

577
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:47,920
我也很高兴能搞懂怎么用GPS
I'm glad I figured out how to work a GPS.

578
00:40:47,930 --> 00:40:50,190
下次能不能搞再复杂点?
Could you make it a little more difficult next time?

579
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:51,390
我欠你一次
I owe you one.

580
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,590
我们扯平了
We're even.

581
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:54,950
但现在我们要走了
But we got to leave.

582
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,820
林肯
Linc.

583
00:40:56,830 --> 00:40:59,520
老兄
Hey, buddy.

584
00:40:59,530 --> 00:41:00,790
你怎么样?
How are you doing?

585
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,620
-LJ在哪儿？-安全的地方
-Where's LJ?-Safe.

586
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:04,950
-那些钱呢？-慢慢再跟你说  我们要走了
-The money?-I'll tell you later;we got to go.

587
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,820
我带了个人过来
I brought someone.

588
00:41:06,830 --> 00:41:10,560
爸爸?
Dad?

589
00:41:23,430 --> 00:41:26,630
我们以前见过
We've met before.

590
00:41:49,830 --> 00:41:52,690
你现在必须告诉我  好吗?
This is happening right now, okay?

591
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:54,590
别逼我这么做
Don't make me do this.

592
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:56,850
别逼我这么做
Don't make me do this.

593
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:59,450
就算我知道也不告诉你
Even if I knew,I wouldn't tell you.

594
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:00,950
不告诉我?  是吗？
You wouldn't? Really?

595
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,420
你有那么笨?
Are you that stupid?

596
00:42:02,430 --> 00:42:04,150
你居然那么愚蠢?!
Are you that stupid?!

597
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:06,290
因为你现在必须要死了!
Because now you're going to die!

598
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:08,920
你要死了 除非你告诉我
You're going to die,and all you had to do

599
00:42:08,930 --> 00:42:12,750
你父亲给了你什么
is tell me what your father gave you.

600
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:14,320
我知道我的处境
I know my options.

601
00:42:14,330 --> 00:42:17,020
要么什么也不说的死  或者说了
I can not tell you and die,or I can tell you

602
00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:18,520
还是死
and still die.

603
00:42:18,530 --> 00:42:20,190
错了
No. Wrong.

604
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:21,720
莎拉
Sara.

605
00:42:21,730 --> 00:42:23,690
得了  放聪明点吧!
Come on, smarten up!

606
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:25,950
哪怕你一辈子就这么一次
For once in your life.

607
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:30,800
拜托了
For once in your life.

608
00:42:34,530 --> 00:42:39,330
去死吧
Go to hell.

609
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:45,590
溺死是很恐怖的   别误解我
Huh? Drowning is horrific--don't get me wrong--

610
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:48,550
但是一到你憋不住让水进到肺里
but once you give in and let the water come into your lungs,

611
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:49,620
会产生某种快感
there's a certain

612
00:42:49,630 --> 00:42:51,620
我听说的
euphoria... I hear.

613
00:42:51,630 --> 00:42:53,250
我猜作为一个瘾君子
I guess as a junkie,

614
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:56,660
我想你大概会喜欢那样
I thought maybe you'd appreciate that.

615
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:01,660
是你让自己落到这种下场的
You did this to yourself.
