那就是我很讲道理

结束之后
when this is all behind us,

129

他从华盛顿带走了些

144
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,300
我不知道你在说什么
I don't know what you're talking about.

145
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,400
东西在哪儿
Where is it?

146
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,300
我不知道
I don't know what you're

147
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,500
你在说什么
talking about.

148
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:05,700
Sara 我还有下一步打算
Sara, there's a next step involved in this,

149
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,900
我想你不想承受的
and you don't want to experience that.

150
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,300
我发誓不知道你在说什么
I swear to God I don't know what you're talking about.

151
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,300
我父亲什么
My father didn't

152
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,600
都没有给我
give me anything.

153
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,600
我不知道你在说什么
I don't know what you're talking about.

154
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,300
原谅我 神父 我犯罪了
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

155
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,100
你上次忏悔是什么时候
How long has it been since your last confession?

156
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,700
这是我第一次
This is my first time.

157
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,700
已经很久了
In a long time.

158
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,800
你知道你所犯错误的本质吗
Are you aware of the nature of your sins?

159
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,600
错误本质
The nature?

160
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,300
我不太清楚
I'm not really sure.

161
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:07,100
在你内心深处 你知道的
Deep down inside your heart, you know.

162
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,700
也许是正义吧
Righteousness, maybe.

163
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,600
为了目的可以不择手段
Believing the ends justify the means.

164
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,400
你的目的是什么
What are those ends?

165
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,900
拯救其他人的性命
Saving someone's life.

166
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:21,900
那么手段呢
And the means?

167
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,300
我触犯了所有的法律
I've broken just about every law you can name.

168
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,900
不仅是我的所作所为
But it's not just what I've done.

169
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,400
而是其他人犯下的错误
It's what others have done...

170
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,400
全是因为我
...because I let them.

171
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,900
因为我自以为做得正确
Because I was doing what I thought was right.

172
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,000
这次我应该更加清醒
I should have known better this time.

173
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,200
这一次
This time?

174
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,100
当我还是小孩时
When I was a kid...

175
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,800
我曾目睹一个人失血致死
I watched a man bleed out and die.

176
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:58,600
并且我很高兴
And I was glad...

177
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,700
因为他罪有应得
because he deserved it.

178
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:02,900
生命的本意就是
Life is

179
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,700
-上帝的给予和夺取 -突然间 
only for God to give and take, my son. Suddenly,

180
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:08,200
我的心里就留下了阴影
there is this dark space inside of me.

181
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,400
并且我知道是错的
And I knew it was wrong.

182
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,400
但是我已经无法自拔
But here I am.

183
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,800
有个方法能让你解脱
Thereisa way to stop this.

184
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,700
在上帝面前改过自新
Surrender your will to God.

185
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:21,200
如果我现在放弃
If I surrender now,

186
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,000
我就失去我所爱的一切
I lose everything that I love.

187
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,600
但是在这过程中你却失去了灵魂
But do you lose your soul in the process?

188
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,000
听着 我们都要背负十字架的
Well, we all have our crosses to bear.

189
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,300
你还好吗
You okay?

190
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,100
这事会没完没了
This is never gonna stop.

191
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,600
他们会在我们后头紧追不舍
They're gonna keep coming after us.

192
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,900
Lincoln 别接
Lincoln, don't.

193
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,100
搞定没有
Is it done?

194
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,100
搞定了
You are.

195
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,400
Lincoln Burrows
Lincoln Burrows.

196
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,100
你的人死了
Your man's dead.

197
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:22,600
和其他你派来抓我儿子的人一样
Just like anyone else you send to take out my son.

198
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,400
我们只想抓你
We want you.

199
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,200
与LJ无关
This isn't about LJ.

200
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,500
有个非常简单的方法
There's a very simple way

201
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:30,600
让这一切结束
for all of this to end.

202
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:31,700
我来告诉你怎样了结…
I'll tell you how it's going to end--

203
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:34,500
那就是你会睁着你的死鱼眼睛 看着我的手勒在你的脖子上
me staring in your dead eye with my hand around your throat.

204
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,800
你都不知道我是谁
You don't even know who I am.

205
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:47,900
还有多远
How much further?

206
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,100
就在这儿停
Right here is good.

207
00:14:00,066 --> 00:14:01,089
Thanks for the ride.

208
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,800
-谢谢你让我搭车 -不客气

209
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:18,700
Mahone探员
Agent Mahone.

210
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:20,000
Bill Kim
Bill Kim.

211
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:22,700
我来接你了
I'm here to pick you up.

212
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:26,000
我是给Kellerman打的电话
I called Kellerman.

213
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,400
他现在正忙
He's busy right now.

214
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,700
还有其他人知道你在这儿吗
Does anyone else know you're here?

215
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,200
-没有 -很好
No. Good.

216
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:34,900
你能打开这门吗
Can you open the gate?

217
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,700
而且我需要一辆新车
And I need a new vehicle.

218
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,800
关于我 有些事情你得了解
There's something you should know about me.

219
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,500
我不喜欢发飙的
I don't like being out in the field.

220
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,500
我只在事情办砸的时候才会那样
I only do so when there's been a screwup.

221
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,300
这会我已经发飙了 Alex
I'm out in the field, Alex.

222
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,600
那么你为什么不开门
Then why don't you open the gate?

223
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:52,700
你可以在你泥足深陷之前
You can hurry back to D.C.

224
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,600
赶紧回华府去
before your shoes get dirty.

225
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,800
我们有一条线索 是关于Burrows
We have a lead as to where Burrows

226
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:59,300
会在哪里和他的兄弟碰头
will be meeting up with his brother.

227
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,600
他提到那个地方叫"Bolshoi Booze"
It's a place he referred to as "Bolshoi Booze."

228
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,400
这让你想起什么来了吗
Does that mean anything to you?

229
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,900
是的 这是Scofield身上数以百计的纹身中的一个
Yeah, it's one of a hundred tattoos on Scofield's body.

230
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,400
那意味着什么
What does it mean?

231
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,600
我还不知道
I don't know yet.

232
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:09,900
在接下来的几个小时里
You'll need to figure it out

233
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,200
你得把它弄清楚
within the next couple of hours.

234
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,400
如果Scofield和Burrows越过了边界
If Scofield and Burrows cross the border,

235
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,100
他们就超出了你的管辖权范围
they'll be out of your jurisdiction,

236
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,300
那么对我们来说你也没有什么长远的价值了
and you'll be of no further value to us.

237
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,300
开门
Open the gate.

238
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,700
那么你能干点什么
So you can do what?

239
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,000
我倒想听一听
I want to hear it.

240
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,300
听听自认为是我们的终结者
Straight from the mouth of the guy

241
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,600
-亲口说出来 -我会抓住Scofield
who's supposed to be our closer. I'll get Scofield

242
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,900
还有Burrows… 和他们一伙的所有的人
and Burrows... and all of the rest of them.

243
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,100
那么我和你
And then me and you

244
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,800
还有Kellerman
and Kellerman,

245
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,600
我们分道扬镳
we're going to part ways.

246
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,200
我只是希望你能确定一个合适的目标
I just hope you're properly motivated.

247
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,300
因为只要你尽你的本分 我们就会忘掉Shales的事
'Cause as long as you do your job, we'll forget about Shales.

248
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,900
那样你就能回科罗拉多去看望你的儿子了
And then you can go back to Colorado and visit your son.

249
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:02,900
Cameron
Cameron.

250
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,400
他5岁了 对吗
He's five, right?

251
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,800
不许你再提他的名字
Don't you ever mention his name again.

252
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:11,800
就是这样
There he is.

253
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,900
这才是我想听到的
That's what I wanted to hear.

254
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:22,800
去干点什么吧 Alex
Get cracking, Alex.

255
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,500
许多人都在指望你
A lot of people are relying on you.

256
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,200
Jane会妥善处理一切 你可以信任她
Jane will take care of it; you can trust her.

257
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,500
我知道这很困难
I know this is hard,

258
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,500
但是会解决的 我向你保证
but it will work out-- you have my word.

259
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,700
-谢谢 -保重
Thank you. Be careful.

260
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,400
听着 呃…
Listen, uh...

261
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,500
我明白
I know.

262
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,700
Jane会照顾你的
Jane's gonna look after you.

263
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:05,900
我甚至都不认识她
I don't even know her.

264
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:06,700
她没问题
She's all right.

265
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,500
她为我爸爸工作一段时间了
She's been working for Dad for a while.

266
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,200
我会 呃…
I'll, uh...

267
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,900
我们很快就会见面 我保证
I'll see you soon, I promise.

268
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
以前你爸爸也跟你说过同样的话吧
Isn't that the same thing your dad told you?

269
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:20,900
是的 但是我是认真的
Yeah, but I mean it.

270
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,500
嘿
Hey.

271
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,400
嘿 是我
Hey, it's me.

272
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,200
你收到这留言就给我打电话 好吗
Just call me when you get this, okay?

273
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,300
这很重要
It's important.

274
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:37,800
这些数字…
the numbers...

275
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:33,900
这就是我要的货
Is that my payment?

276
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:37,600
医用硝化甘油
Medical nitroglycerine?

277
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:39,000
跟说好的一样
As promised.

278
00:21:45,294 --> 00:21:46,439
Whoo.

279
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,100
你知道弄到这种等级的货有多难
You have no idea how hard it is to get this kind of grade.

280
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,200
即使是我接头人也一样
Even with my contacts.

281
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,300
到你结束这笔交易的时候了
It's time for your end of the deal.

282
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,000
那飞机在哪儿
Where's that plane gonna be?

283
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:01,100
他们会在降落前几小时打电话告诉我
They call me a couple of hours before with the drop-off point.

284
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:03,500
这样可以不让缉毒局盯上我们
It keeps the DEA off our backs.

285
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,300
所以这还得等上一段时间
Since it's going to be a while,

286
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,400
你大概想站在大太阳里等
you might want to stay out of the sun.

287
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,900
嘿 嘿 嘿
Hey, hey, hey.

288
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:17,400
嘿
Hey.

289
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:20,400
有什么问题
Is there a problem?

290
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:22,300
他们是我的表兄
They're my cousins.

291
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
听着 你父亲
Now, after your father accessed

292
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,700
得到消息后
this information, he made

293
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,300
用他的手机
three calls

294
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,200
打了三通电话 都是给你的
from his cell phone, all to you.

295
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:44,500
他跟你说什么了
What did he tell you?

296
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:46,300
就说他要回芝加哥
Just that he was coming back to Chicago.

297
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:48,800
很好
Good.

298
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,300
你很诚实 很好
You're being honest. Good.

299
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,200
现在 从他飞机着陆到他回到家
Now, there's a half an hour between when your father landed

300
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,300
其间有半个小时去向不明
and when he got home that is unaccounted for.

301
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:57,300
我知道你去了他办公室
I know you stopped by his office.

302
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,800
-你在那里见到他了吗 -没有
Did you see him there? No.

303
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,800
我最后一次见到我父亲时 他已经死在了他的书房里
The last time I saw my father, he was dead in his study.

304
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,400
你父亲有没有让谁给过你什么东西
Did your father have anyone give you anything?

305
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,500
你以为因为我喜欢被你捆着
Do you think that I'm just withholding information

306
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,200
而故意隐瞒什么消息吗
because I like hanging out with you?

307
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:09,000
如果我知道什么
If I knew something,

308
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:10,200
我会告诉你 但我不知道
I would tell you; I don't.

309
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:12,300
对于这些事情我什么也不知道
I don't know anything about any of this.

310
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:13,500
真的
Really?

311
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,500
那么为什么你要把Linconln Burrows
Then why did you give your father the file

312
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,600
的文件给你父亲
on Lincoln Burrows?

313
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,000
你为什么要给Scofield留门
Why did you open the door for Scofield,

314
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,500
帮他逃跑 为什么Scofield
and help him escape? Why did Scofield

315
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,000
要给你寄这些密码纸条
send you those coded notes?

316
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:25,200
为什么你要到新墨西哥州来见他
Why did you come to New Mexico to meet him?

317
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,900
别想耍我 把我当成不懂事的孩子
Don't try to float a babe- in-the-woods routine by me.

318
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:32,700
那可真的会把我惹毛 所以…
It's really going to piss me off, so...

319
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:34,300
来吧
Come on.

320
00:23:53,687 --> 00:23:55,278
Shh. Shh-shh.

321
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,300
你没事
You're okay.

322
00:23:56,765 --> 00:23:57,839
Shh.

323
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,400
听着 Sara
Look, Sara.

324
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:11,900
我们还是来达成一个协议吧 你知道的 对吧
We're going to have to come to an understanding.

325
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,400
没错 你说得对 那是坐标
Yeah, you were right; they are coordinates.

326
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:24,900
把它们输入你的GPS
Plug them into your GPS.

327
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,100
他们会在新墨西哥州的 沙漠中定位一个地点
They'll take you to a spot in the New Mexico desert.

328
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:29,000
那地方四周基本都是空旷的
It's in the middle of nowhere, basically.

329
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:30,700
谢了
Thanks.

330
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:31,900
好的 没问题
Yeah, no problem.

331
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,800
长官 你要去见谁
Sir, who are you meeting?

332
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:36,400
见鬼 他在干什么
What the hell is he doing?

333
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:39,000
他要把我们排除在外 这就是他在做的
He's keeping us out of the loop, that's what he's doing.

334
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,700
通常亡命天涯的人都没什么健康可言
Constantly running from the law with a bad heart...

335
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,200
墨西哥 我们来的地方 那里有许多好东西
Mexico, where I'm from has got a lot of great things,

336
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:50,200
但是…医疗体系却不是其中之一
but... health care ain't one of them.

337
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,100
你还好吗
You all right?

338
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,100
你看起来有点儿紧张
You look a little nervous.

339
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:55,900
我并不是每天都干这事儿
I don't do this every day.

340
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,900
我只想得到那飞机的消息
I just want to get the information on that plane

341
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:59,400
然后 呃…
and, uh...

342
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,100
走人
move on.

343
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,400
就是这样
Is that it?

344
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,600
就这样
That's it.

345
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:07,300
我知道你是谁
I know who you are.

346
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:09,500
你用不着担心…我们可不会
You don't have to worry-- we can't

347
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,400
让手握赏金的
go within 100 feet of a federal marshal

348
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:12,400
联邦警察离我们只有100英尺
to collect the reward,

349
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:15,600
因为我们可是美国和墨西哥通缉犯
'cause we got U.S. and Mexican warrants on our heads.

350
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:18,400
但是这架飞机是去巴拿马的…
But this plane to Panama...

351
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:20,000
坐下来
Sit down.

352
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,000
这一切都是为了你哥哥
This is all for your brother?

353
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:31,200
是的
Yes.

354
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:35,200
我有四个兄弟 两个在监狱里
I got four brothers, two in prison.

355
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,200
打电话问候 我会
Accept a call? Yes.

356
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:39,700
但是救他们出来
But break them out?

357
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,700
-简直是疯了 -我哥哥
Loco. My brother gave me

358
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:44,300
在我14岁生日的时候 送我一个棒球手套
a baseball mitt for my 14th birthday.

359
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:45,900
我欠他的
I owed him.

360
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,000
你比我好
You're a better man than I am.

361
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,400
现在还说不准
Time will tell.

362
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,800
他们不是该打电话来了吗… 关于那飞机
Shouldn't they have called by now... about the plane?

363
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,200
没错
Yeah.

364
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:06,300
要知道 我… 我有个问题
You know, I... I have a question.

365
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:09,600
我觉得
I thought

366
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:11,700
这些应该装在玻璃瓶子里
that these came in glass vials,

367
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,500
而不是塑料的
not plastic.

368
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,600
我也这么想 但是
I thought so, too, but the guy

369
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:20,600
把这些卖给我的那家伙说 他用塑料瓶装
I bought it from said he packed it in plastic

370
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:23,200
是为了长途运输中以防起火
for transportation over long distances to prevent a fire

371
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:25,500
或是爆炸
or an explosion.

372
00:26:25,781 --> 00:26:26,829
真的吗
Really?

373
00:26:28,557 --> 00:26:30,012
这我还真不知道
I never heard of that.

374
00:26:39,907 --> 00:26:41,050
干什么
What's going on?

375
00:26:41,541 --> 00:26:43,665
我们得验验质量如何
We're going to do a little quality control test.

376
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:45,281
这已经是最好的了
It's the best available.

377
00:26:45,634 --> 00:26:46,562
我们有的是时间
We got time.

378
00:27:21,036 --> 00:27:23,596
我只记得是一些黑人 20出头
For the last time, some black male, early 20s,

379
00:27:23,684 --> 00:27:24,563
从我背后跳出来
jumped me from behind.

380
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:26,235
我没看清他长什么样
I didn't get a good look at his face.

381
00:27:26,314 --> 00:27:27,843
袭击者从背后攻击你
The assailant attacked you from behind?

382
00:27:27,947 --> 00:27:28,923
我刚才不是说了吗
That's what I just said.

383
00:27:29,026 --> 00:27:31,467
他还能在你脑门儿上来一下子
Yet he managed to make contact square on your forehead.

384
00:27:31,570 --> 00:27:32,322
正是
That's right.

385
00:27:32,434 --> 00:27:34,122
用什么 回旋镖吗
With what? A boomerang?

386
00:27:34,187 --> 00:27:35,634
算了吧 跟我说说到底怎么回事
Come on, why don't you tell me what happened?

387
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:38,997
我是个Illinois州退休的管教干部
Look, I'm a retired correctional officer out of Illinois.

388
00:27:39,637 --> 00:27:42,163
看在同行份上睁一眼闭一眼吧 亲爱的
How about showing some professional courtesy, honey?

389
00:27:51,665 --> 00:27:53,673
我是Roy Geary 请留言
This is Roy Geary. Leave a message.

390
00:27:53,817 --> 00:27:55,705
你这个手脚不干净的王八蛋
You thieving son of a bitch.

391
00:27:55,808 --> 00:27:56,841
你最好跪下
You better get down on your knees

392
00:27:56,944 --> 00:27:58,281
求求老天爷别叫我找到你
and pray to God that I don't find you,

393
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,697
因为如果我找到你 给我听好了
because, if I do, mark my words,

394
00:28:01,208 --> 00:28:02,873
我会把你大卸八块
I'm going to gut you bow to stern.

395
00:28:06,151 --> 00:28:08,518
总统Reynolds 今早在Florida州的Tallahassee
President Reynolds was in Tallahassee, Florida,

396
00:28:08,608 --> 00:28:10,872
出席Martin Kleinhenz
early this morning, attending a $5,000-a-plate

397
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,461
为再次竞选参议员
breakfast fund-raiser for Senator Martin Kleinhenz,

398
00:28:14,564 --> 00:28:15,867
而举办的5千块一位的慈善捐赠早餐
who's running for reelection.

399
00:28:15,963 --> 00:28:18,643
今天下午晚些时候 在她的记者招待会上
Later this afternoon, her press conference was derailed

400
00:28:18,732 --> 00:28:20,363
当一位记者请她
when a reporter asked her to comment

401
00:28:20,452 --> 00:28:22,891
对Lincoln Burrows的 再次出逃作出评论时
on Lincoln Burrows' escape from custody.

402
00:28:23,194 --> 00:28:24,067
她拒绝回答
She declined.

403
00:28:24,547 --> 00:28:26,802
在上任一个月后
It's become clear in her first month in office

404
00:28:26,906 --> 00:28:29,945
她对这次追捕行动的紧密关注 已经在民众心中逐渐清晰了
that she cannot separate herself from this manhunt.

405
00:28:30,225 --> 00:28:31,128
只要事情没有结果…
And as long as it continues...

406
00:28:31,599 --> 00:28:34,678
…评论家说关于Burrows的话题仍将…
...pundits say that questions about Burrows will contin...

407
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:40,612
小姐们
Ladies.

408
00:28:41,221 --> 00:28:42,955
开始狂欢吧
Let's get this party started.

409
00:28:44,355 --> 00:28:46,419
30年来我一直恨你
The last 30 years, I've hated you.

410
00:28:46,714 --> 00:28:47,691
你抛弃了我
You walked out on me.

411
00:28:50,442 --> 00:28:51,913
你连Michael长什么样儿都不知道
You haven't even seen Michael.

412
00:28:54,282 --> 00:28:55,521
我看到过他
I've seen him before.

413
00:28:57,161 --> 00:28:58,560
不是在报纸上 爸爸
Not in the papers, Dad.

414
00:29:00,609 --> 00:29:03,321
我一直不明白什么人会抛弃家人
Been trying to work out what kind of man abandons his family.

415
00:29:06,096 --> 00:29:07,847
如今我也在做同样的事
Now I'm doing the same damn thing.

416
00:29:10,647 --> 00:29:11,743
你会再见到他的
You'll see him again.

417
00:29:12,231 --> 00:29:13,463
我会尽力的
I'll make sure of it.

418
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:18,797
还有多远
How much further?

419
00:29:18,951 --> 00:29:20,078
大概三个小时车程
About three hours.

420
00:29:27,924 --> 00:29:29,060
很快就好
It's gonna be a few minutes.

421
00:29:29,189 --> 00:29:30,275
我哥哥很快就到
My brother should be here soon.

422
00:29:30,507 --> 00:29:33,012
我应该站在外面 他好能看见我
Maybe I should go outside and make sure he can see me.

423
00:29:33,115 --> 00:29:33,812
好主意
That's a good idea.

424
00:29:33,915 --> 00:29:35,427
让Ernesto去就行了
I think I'm gonna send Ernesto to do it.

425

是的
Yes, it was.

你犯了大错 兄弟
You just made a big mistake, blanquito.

436
00:30:16,143 --> 00:30:17,558
对不起 对不起
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, okay?

437
00:30:17,638 --> 00:30:18,534
我不是一个化学家
I'm not a chemist.

438
00:30:18,797 --> 00:30:20,885
卖给我的那人说就是药用硝化甘油
The guy I bought it from swore it was medical nitro.

439
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:23,432
我们都被耍了
We both got screwed.

440
00:30:23,518 --> 00:30:24,923
是的 但只有一个人要为此掏腰包
Yeah, but only one of us is gonna pay for it.

441
00:30:25,002 --> 00:30:25,733
听着 我只想离开这儿
Look, I just want to get

442

我哥哥马上就到

我们会想办法
We'll work something out.

445
00:30:31,447 --> 00:30:32,415
你只管开价吧
Just name your price.

446
00:30:32,991 --> 00:30:34,215
我已经开过价了
I already named my price.

447
00:30:35,654 --> 00:30:37,029
是你自己不守约
You didn't go through.

448
00:30:46,724 --> 00:30:47,598
你哥哥什么时候到
When's your brother getting here?

449
00:30:48,164 --> 00:30:50,988
你想一起把我们交公了 对吧
You were planning on turning us in the whole time, weren't you?

450
00:30:51,284 --> 00:30:52,762
他什么时候和你会面
When's he supposed to meet you here?!

451
00:30:52,868 --> 00:30:53,581
放下武器
Sueltalo.

452
00:30:54,787 --> 00:30:55,891
放下枪 要么我就打死他
Drop it, or I'm gonna shoot him.

453
00:30:56,028 --> 00:30:57,211
放了他 要么我就打死你
Let him go, or I'll shoot you.

454
00:30:57,315 --> 00:30:59,131
-把枪放下 -我不会放下的
Suelta la pistola. Ey, no estoy judiendo.

455
00:30:59,259 --> 00:30:59,929
放下枪
Sueltala, cabron!

456
00:31:04,219 --> 00:31:04,978
闭嘴

457
00:31:17,721 --> 00:31:18,406
在哪儿
Where is it?

458
00:31:18,527 --> 00:31:20,495
我父亲什么都没给过我
My father didn't give me anything.

459
00:31:23,758 --> 00:31:25,357
你把希望寄托在谁身上呢

Lincoln Burrows

一个街头混混
Street thug.

462
00:31:33,653 --> 00:31:34,853
这就是你关心的吗
And why is that your concern?

463
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:36,837
"希波克拉底誓言"里不是说 (古代西方医生开业誓言)
I mean, is there somewhere in the Hippocratic Oath

464
00:31:36,909 --> 00:31:38,896
"我发誓把我的生命献给"
where it says, "I pledge to risk my life

465
00:31:39,308 --> 00:31:40,849
"那些对我毫不关心的人"
for those who don't care about mine"?

466
00:31:40,946 --> 00:31:43,189
"因为他们并不关心你"
'Cause they don't care about yours.

467
00:31:43,399 --> 00:31:45,415
Burrows和Michael Scofield

468
00:31:45,831 --> 00:31:46,693
他们只是利用你
just used you.

469
00:31:48,311 --> 00:31:50,197
世上还有和你一样执着的人
Are you that surprised that there are people in the world

470
00:31:50,302 --> 00:31:51,750
你感到惊讶吗
who will stand up to people like you?

471
00:31:52,597 --> 00:31:53,789
你没几天活头了
Are you that far gone?

472
00:31:54,581 --> 00:31:55,484
说得不错
That's cute.

473
00:31:56,452 --> 00:31:57,213
痛
Sad.

474
00:31:59,363 --> 00:32:00,420
并快乐着
But cute.

475
00:32:15,986 --> 00:32:17,530
Cleveland的什么地方
A Cleveland what?

476
00:32:17,634 --> 00:32:18,954
别急 我慢慢跟你讲

477
00:32:19,554 --> 00:32:20,237

00:32:25,024 --> 00:32:25,993
绝对不行
Hell no.

480
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,080
1000块我就干
I'll do it for a thousand.

00:32:31,672 --> 00:32:33,318

$750.

484
00:32:34,798 --> 00:32:35,862
好吧
All right.

485
00:32:48,741 --> 00:32:49,964
这是什么
What the hell?

486
00:33:01,025 --> 00:33:02,418
出去
Leave.

487
00:33:06,522 --> 00:33:07,514
知道吗
You know,

488
00:33:08,401 --> 00:33:11,145
在军用品商店
it's amazing what you can pick up

489
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:12,945
总能找到好东西
at an Army-Navy store.

490
00:33:13,848 --> 00:33:16,049
那些折磨你的点子 都是Bellick想出来的
All that torture stuff, that was Bellick's idea.

491
00:33:16,169 --> 00:33:18,703
依我看 他做得有点过分了
And if you ask me, he took the whole thing way too far.

492
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:20,000
听着
Listen,

493
00:33:20,119 --> 00:33:21,991
我跟你一半钱作为补偿如何
why don't I just give you half the money, and we call it a day?

494
00:33:22,807 --> 00:33:24,088
好吧 四六开
All right, 60-40.

495
00:33:24,887 --> 00:33:26,438
别这样 T 我们还可以再商量
Come on, T, we can deal.

496
00:33:32,861 --> 00:33:33,934
飞机在哪儿降落
Where's the plane going to land?

497
00:33:35,221 --> 00:33:36,404
去你的吧 胆小鬼
Kiss my ass, cobarde.

498
00:33:42,494 --> 00:33:43,418
我们怎么办
What are we going to do?

499
00:33:43,885 --> 00:33:45,483
我还没想好
I don't know yet.

500
00:33:45,915 --> 00:33:48,160
从地面越境行不通
We're not going to get across the border on the ground.

501
00:33:48,392 --> 00:33:49,937
没有飞机 我们就完了
Without that plane, we're screwed.

502
00:33:50,104 --> 00:33:51,288
他失血过多
He's losing too much blood.

503
00:33:51,393 --> 00:33:52,960
-他这样撑不了多久 -他要杀我们之前
He'll never make it like this. He should have thought

504
00:33:53,024 --> 00:33:54,087
就应该知道后果
of that before he tried to kill us.

505
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,300
我们得送他去医院
We got to take him to a hospital,

506
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,600
要不他就死定了
or else he'll die.

507
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:58,200
拜托
Please.

508
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:02,400
告诉我们飞机在哪儿 就放你们走
The plane, and we'll let you go.

509
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,000
告诉我
Dicelo.

510
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:06,100
把一切都告诉我
Dicelo todo.

511
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,300
现在就告诉我
Dicelo ahora!

512
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:16,800
Finley路…
Finley Road...

513
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,800
从高速路8号出口出去 有一条飞机跑道
off of Highway 8, there's an airstrip.

514
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:22,500
就在那儿 成了吗 快放我们走
There, okay? Now let us go.

515
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:23,600
-我们走 -不 不 不
Let's go. No, no, no!

516

快走啊 Michael
Let's go, Michael.

521
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,100
如果是我们受伤了
If we were bleeding

522
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,400
他才不会高抬贵手
he would have not lifted a finger,

523
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,000
你知道的 他会把我们都杀了
you know that-- he was gonna kill us both.

524
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:39,700
-走吧 -不 并不是那么回事
Let's go. No, that's not true.

525
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:41,800
Michael 我们必须要赶到飞机那儿…
Michael, we're going to get to that plane...

526
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:42,700

Don't do this.

527
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,200

530
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:47,800
别这样 可以吗
Don't do, all right?

531
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:48,700
别听他的
Don't listen to him!

532
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:50,700
求你了
Please.

00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,200
Sara 我很担心你
Sara, I care about you.

534
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:00,100
这不是我的本意 Sara
This is not what I wanted, Sara.

535
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:13,500
我是Kellerman
Kellerman.

536
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Sara怎么样啦
What's going on with Sara?

537
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:16,800
她有没有告诉你什么
Has she told you anything?

538
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:21,300
哪儿也不许去
Don't go anywhere.

539
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:22,600
现在不行
Not yet.

540
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,100
我一直都以为你很有说服力

嗯 可她知道些什么
Well, she knows something.

544
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:36,200
你要是不听我的 连你都得玩完
You disobey me, you are done.

545
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,800
明白吗
Do you understand me?

546
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,200
杀了她灭口 Paul
Put her in the ground, Paul?

547

00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:37,100
Michael 这么干不行 我们赶快离开这儿
Michael, we're doing it wrong-- let's get out of here.

551
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,700
否则他会报警的
Now, he's gonna call the cops,

552
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:40,600
-或者召集他的手下… -他不会这么干的
or go get his buddies... He's not going to make it.

-你必须得… -闭嘴

不要去Finley路

562
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,900
飞机会在日落时分停在4号公路的
The plane is going to stop at the seven mile marker

563
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,800

567
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:23,200
如果你们错过它就惨了
If you miss it, you're out of luck.

568
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,600
他在途中失血过多身亡
He bled out on the way over.

569
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:36,700
知道他的身份么
Any ID?

570
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,900
是的 Roy Geary 是个外地人
Yeah, Roy Geary, just an out-of-stater.

571
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:51,600
你认识他
You know him?

572
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:53,000
他是我的朋友
He's a friend of mine.

573
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:54,900
Bellick先生
Mr. Bellick?

574
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:55,700
怎么
Yeah.

575
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,700
你能不能回答几个问题
You mind answering a few more questions?

576
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:09,900
喂
Yeah.

577
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,000
我是Pam
It's Pam.

578
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:14,600
出什么事了
What's going on?

579
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:18,200
我只想跟你打个招呼
I just wanted to say hey.

580
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:20,900
嗯… 你还好吗
Well... are you all right?

581
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,400
你说过这很重要
You said it was important.

582
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:27,800
我知道事情变得有些讨厌了…
I know things got kind of ugly toward the...

583
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,800
你知道 越到后来越是这样
you know, the end.

584
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,600
嗯…我也变得讨厌了
Um... I got ugly.

585
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:37,200
但是我希望你能理解 出于一些客观原因
But I want you to know that, that there were circumstances

586
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,400
嗯…
that, uh...

587
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:41,800
你和Cameron
It was better that you and Cameron

588
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:45,000
还是不和我在一起比较好
that you were not with me.

589
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,900
你为什么要现在跟我说这些
Why are you telling me this now?

590
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:50,200
如果我还能重来一次…
If I had to do it all over again...

591
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:53,300
我不会选择这种方式
I'd do it different.

592
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:57,800
我会让一家人团圆
We'd still be a family.

593
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:00,900
我会为此不惜一切代价
I'd give anything for that.

594
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,700
我只是想让你知道
I just wanted you to know.

595
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Alex…
Alex...

596
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:07,700
到底出什么事了
what's going on?

597
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,000
没什么
Nothing.

598
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:12,100
我打电话只是想说….
I just wanted to call to say that I was, uh....

599
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:15,700
我对不起你
...that I'm sorry

600
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
一切都是我不好
about everything.

601
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:20,600
你现在在哪儿
Where are you right now?

602
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:22,200
我可以去找你
I can come get you.

603
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:23,600
这真让人感动 是不是
Wouldn't that be nice, huh?

604
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:25,800
不 我是认真的 你在哪儿
No, I'm serious. Where are you?

605
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:27,300
还有一件事
One more thing.

606
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,600
如果你在媒体上看到什么消息…
If you hear anything in the media...

607
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:31,600
什么
What?

608
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,300
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

609
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:41,500
我爱你

610
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:42,900
帮我亲Cam一下好么

611
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:32,900
嗯… 我很高兴我把这个地方告诉了你
Well... I'm glad I told you about this place.

612
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:35,200
也很高兴我学会了怎么用GPS
I'm glad I figured out how to work a GPS.

613
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:36,900
你下次能不能把事情搞得再复杂点啊
Could you make it a little more difficult next time?

614
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,100
我欠你个情
I owe you one.

615
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,800
咱们扯平了
We're even.

616
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:40,900
不过该走了
But we got to leave.

617
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:44,100
Linc
Linc.

618
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,100
嘿 哥们儿
Hey, buddy.

619
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:47,800
你好吗
How are you doing?

620
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:50,000
-LJ在哪儿 -他很安全
Where's LJ? Safe.

621
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:52,300
-钱呢 -我一会儿再告诉你 我们得出发了
The money? I'll tell you later; we got to go.

622
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:53,400
我还带了个人来
I brought someone.

623
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:55,800
爸
Dad?

624
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:12,200
我们以前见过
We've met before.

625
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:40,000
我马上就得动手了 知道吗
This is happening right now, okay?

626
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:41,500
别逼我这么做
Don't make me do this.

627
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,300
别逼我这么做

628
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:46,400
就算我知道 也不会告诉你的
Even if I knew, I wouldn't tell you.

629
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,000
你不会 是吗
You wouldn't? Really?

630
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,700
你怎么这么傻
Are you that stupid?

631
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,500
你怎么就这么傻呢
Are you that stupid?!

632
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:53,700
因为现在你马上就要死了
Because now you're going to die!

633
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:56,000
你就要死了 而你只要告诉我
You're going to die, and all you had to do

634
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,500
你父亲给了你什么东西
is tell me what your father gave you.

635
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:01,100
我知道我的选择是什么
I know my options.

636
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,900
如果不说 会被你杀了 而如果我说了
I can not tell you and die, or I can tell you

637
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:04,800
也一样会被你杀了
and still die.

638
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:07,300
不 你错了
No. Wrong.

639
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,200
Sara
Sara.

640
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:10,100
快 放聪明点
Come on, smarten up!

641
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,100
哪怕一辈子就这一次呢
For once in your life.

642
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:13,800
求你了
Please.

643
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:23,300
你去死
Go to hell.

644
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:32,900
哦 淹死是很恐怖的 别逼我干这种傻事
Huh? Drowning is horrific-- don't get me wrong--

645
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,900
但是一旦你放弃挣扎 让水灌到你肺里
but once you give in and let the water come into your lungs,

646
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:36,900
却会有一种
there's a certain

647
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,700
快感…我是这么听说的
euphoria... I hear.

648
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:40,700
我猜是痛并快乐着
I guess as a junkie,

649
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:42,400
但愿你会喜欢这种感觉
I thought maybe you'd appreciate that.

650
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:47,600
这是你自找的
You did this to yourself.

651
