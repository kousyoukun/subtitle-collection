1
00:00:00,433 --> 00:00:02,444
Previously on Prison Break...

2
00:00:04,805 --> 00:00:06,597
There's one big difference
between you and I, Michael.

3
00:00:07,189 --> 00:00:08,157
You can't kill.

4
00:00:09,037 --> 00:00:09,989
I will get you.

5
00:00:10,269 --> 00:00:13,813
This is, uh...
in case you run into trouble

6
00:00:13,938 --> 00:00:14,828
down the road.

7
00:00:15,396 --> 00:00:17,700
Lincoln, he really wants
to see you and your brother.

8
00:00:17,836 --> 00:00:19,347
He hasn't seen Michael
since he was ten years old.

9
00:00:20,747 --> 00:00:21,531
Why are we going?

10
00:00:21,642 --> 00:00:23,003
Michael never met
your grandfather.

11
00:00:23,707 --> 00:00:24,483
Dad.

12
00:00:24,601 --> 00:00:26,627
I got Burrows.
Take care of them.

13
00:00:26,874 --> 00:00:28,547
I think there's a part of me
that enjoys this.

14
00:00:28,835 --> 00:00:29,714
It feels to me like

15
00:00:29,803 --> 00:00:30,913
chasing a high.

16
00:00:31,577 --> 00:00:33,489
And I should know better

17
00:00:33,914 --> 00:00:34,640
by now.

18
00:00:35,465 --> 00:00:36,496
Sara?

19
00:00:40,124 --> 00:00:41,045
Hi, Sara.

20
00:00:41,715 --> 00:00:43,378
Hey, what is this?

21
00:00:43,489 --> 00:00:46,937
It's for my... blood pressure.

22
00:00:47,225 --> 00:00:49,850
Geary, come on, we
can make a deal, man.
No deals.

23
00:00:49,928 --> 00:00:52,073
You just crapped out
your last bargaining chip, pal.

24
00:00:52,488 --> 00:00:54,792
Ain't that the most beautiful
thing you ever seen?

25
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:18,472
This is the Tribune Police.

26
00:01:25,848 --> 00:01:27,086
This is the Tribune Police.

27
00:01:27,294 --> 00:01:28,709
Make yourself known.

28
00:01:45,226 --> 00:01:46,490
Hey, you're in luck.

29
00:01:47,735 --> 00:01:48,831
Had a case in back.

30
00:01:49,183 --> 00:01:50,064
Excellent.

31
00:01:50,975 --> 00:01:51,976
Fishing reel oil.

32
00:01:53,567 --> 00:01:55,286
And you want
the whole case?

33
00:01:57,878 --> 00:01:59,006
Whole case.

34
00:02:00,038 --> 00:02:02,229
And the, uh, GPS?

35
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:04,837
And the GPS.

36
00:02:05,165 --> 00:02:06,557
Must do quite a bit
of fishing.

37
00:02:07,316 --> 00:02:08,452
Yeah, a lot of fishing...

38
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,316
not a whole lot of catching.

39
00:02:10,796 --> 00:02:13,428
$96.23.

40
00:02:20,123 --> 00:02:22,354
Um...

41
00:02:22,586 --> 00:02:23,930
I'm just going to take
the reel oil.

42
00:02:28,232 --> 00:02:29,144
Thank you.

43
00:02:29,287 --> 00:02:29,991
Thank you.

44
00:02:38,211 --> 00:02:39,913
Hey! You have to pay for that.

45
00:02:47,774 --> 00:02:49,902
Just take it;
please don't hurt me.

46
00:02:51,566 --> 00:02:52,549
Please.

47
00:03:07,733 --> 00:03:08,732
You have to pay for that.

48
00:03:10,669 --> 00:03:11,899
Vault. Open it.

49
00:03:12,667 --> 00:03:13,803
One for the team.

50
00:03:18,594 --> 00:03:21,842
He wasn't gunning for me,
he was gunning for my daughter.

51
00:03:21,947 --> 00:03:24,065
Give Anna her papa's love.

52
00:03:27,097 --> 00:03:28,648
I'm going cut your throat out.

53
00:03:30,401 --> 00:03:31,735
I loved you, Michael.

54
00:03:31,872 --> 00:03:33,095
You just used me.

55
00:03:33,512 --> 00:03:35,072
Cops found your girlfriend

56
00:03:35,176 --> 00:03:36,328
fish-belly white,

57
00:03:36,432 --> 00:03:37,856
gargling her own puke.

58
00:03:37,936 --> 00:03:38,910
And what do you care?

59
00:03:39,063 --> 00:03:39,903
As long as she left

60
00:03:39,938 --> 00:03:41,256
the door open.

61
00:03:43,434 --> 00:03:45,863
I feel very fortunate
to have met you.

62
00:03:46,067 --> 00:03:47,301
I'm sorry, Henry.

63
00:04:09,733 --> 00:04:12,652
It's about corporate interests
taking over the government--

64
00:04:12,853 --> 00:04:15,810
buying elections,
fighting wars...

65
00:04:16,315 --> 00:04:18,883
people dying so they
can turn a profit.

66
00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:20,979
We're trying to stop it.

67
00:04:21,075 --> 00:04:22,731
What are you, a
bunch of spies?

68
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:26,361
Just a handful of
senators, congressmen,

69
00:04:26,442 --> 00:04:27,769
people like me
that once worked

70
00:04:27,881 --> 00:04:28,633
for the company.

71
00:04:29,146 --> 00:04:30,785
People willing to expose
the President

72
00:04:30,898 --> 00:04:32,009
for what she is--

73
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:34,377
a shill working
for these corporations.

74
00:04:34,481 --> 00:04:35,329
We bring her down,

75
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:36,450
we bring them down.

76
00:04:37,544 --> 00:04:38,609
What's it got to do with me?

77
00:04:38,784 --> 00:04:40,192
Because the way we're
going to bring her down

78
00:04:40,297 --> 00:04:42,255
is also what we're going
to use to set you free.

79
00:04:43,368 --> 00:04:45,320
About a week ago,
we finally got a break.

80
00:04:45,735 --> 00:04:48,751
An NSA analyst
sympathetic to our cause

81
00:04:49,254 --> 00:04:52,086
finally worked his way up
and got clearance

82
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:53,454
into the Echelon program.

83
00:04:54,566 --> 00:04:57,654
E-mails, cell phone calls
all across this country,

84
00:04:57,765 --> 00:04:59,885
if it's transmitted,
it goes through Echelon.

85
00:05:00,389 --> 00:05:01,668
It's catalogued, interpreted,

86
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:03,835
and then stored
for Homeland Security.

87
00:05:04,269 --> 00:05:05,356
Nothing is missed by them.

88
00:05:06,132 --> 00:05:06,835
Nothing.

89
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,235
Including,

90
00:05:08,684 --> 00:05:09,780
by accident,

91
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:12,147
for a few months after 9-11...

92
00:05:13,739 --> 00:05:14,739
the White House.

93
00:05:16,074 --> 00:05:18,042
The analyst got his hands
on a phone conversation

94
00:05:18,169 --> 00:05:20,978
the President had
with Terrence Steadman...

95
00:05:21,353 --> 00:05:22,649
two weeks after you

96
00:05:22,747 --> 00:05:24,065
supposedly killed him.

97
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:28,640
Now, the analyst tried
to get this information

98
00:05:28,752 --> 00:05:29,705
out of the building...

99
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,192
...but it turns out,
someone else was snooping, too.

100
00:05:39,295 --> 00:05:40,037
Someone else

101
00:05:40,147 --> 00:05:42,665
wanted answers
about the President.

102
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:48,646
Aldo and Lincoln want
to be left alone.

103
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:49,926
Sure, I understand.

104
00:05:54,958 --> 00:05:57,181
24 hours later,
Tancredi is dead,

105
00:05:57,485 --> 00:05:58,820
the analyst is missing,

106
00:05:58,965 --> 00:06:00,501
and the White House
Echelon tapes

107
00:06:00,629 --> 00:06:02,365
have been deleted
from the mainframe.

108
00:06:06,084 --> 00:06:07,779
The tape is still out there.

109
00:06:08,211 --> 00:06:11,412
And judging by how hard they're
going after Sara Tancredi,

110
00:06:11,514 --> 00:06:13,155
I'm pretty sure
they think she has it.

111
00:06:14,514 --> 00:06:15,786
And I think they're right.

112
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:18,274
She's the key
to this whole thing,

113
00:06:18,402 --> 00:06:19,273
Lincoln.

114
00:08:02,707 --> 00:08:12,288
<font color="#ffff00">www.1000fr.com Present</font>

115
00:08:12,448 --> 00:08:22,254
<font color="#ffff00">Capture:FRM@FadeOut
Sync:FRM@Navel</font>

116
00:08:34,692 --> 00:08:35,419
I would imagine

117
00:08:37,492 --> 00:08:39,603
that you're feeling
slightly betrayed right now.

118
00:08:42,305 --> 00:08:43,138
I understand.

119
00:08:54,121 --> 00:08:55,105
As you can see,

120
00:08:55,736 --> 00:08:58,169
hi, my name is not Lance,
and I'm not an addict.

121
00:09:00,431 --> 00:09:01,212
Okay.

122
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:04,362
There is one thing
about me that should mean

123
00:09:04,443 --> 00:09:06,173
a great deal to
you right now.

124
00:09:06,266 --> 00:09:07,834
That is I am reasonable.

125
00:09:08,417 --> 00:09:11,064
If you tell me what
you know, you get to go.

126
00:09:11,648 --> 00:09:12,483
Okay, and then maybe

127
00:09:12,648 --> 00:09:14,105
when this is all behind us,

128
00:09:14,266 --> 00:09:16,262
we get to grab a piece of pie
for old times' sake.

129
00:09:17,356 --> 00:09:18,085
Okay.

130
00:09:25,827 --> 00:09:27,043
I don't know where Michael is.

131
00:09:27,138 --> 00:09:28,924
This is not about Michael;
this is about your father.

132
00:09:29,978 --> 00:09:31,394
He left Washington
with something

133
00:09:31,474 --> 00:09:32,755
that didn't belong to him.

134
00:09:33,434 --> 00:09:34,410
We need it back.

135
00:09:34,714 --> 00:09:35,769
And you killed him for it.

136
00:09:35,881 --> 00:09:38,918
I didn't, no, for
what that's worth.

137
00:09:39,849 --> 00:09:40,984
But I hope that his death

138
00:09:41,961 --> 00:09:43,704
properly illustrates
the magnitude

139
00:09:44,297 --> 00:09:46,191
of the situation
that we're in right now.

140
00:09:49,703 --> 00:09:51,511
So, where is it?

141
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:54,887
I don't know what
you're talking about.

142
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,062
Where is it?

143
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:58,318
I don't know what
you're talking about.

144
00:09:58,470 --> 00:09:59,382
Where is it?

145
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:01,254
I don't know what you're

146
00:10:01,358 --> 00:10:02,510
talking about.

147
00:10:02,886 --> 00:10:05,693
Sara, there's a next step
involved in this,

148
00:10:06,023 --> 00:10:07,941
and you don't want
to experience that.

149
00:10:13,627 --> 00:10:16,291
I swear to God I don't know
what you're talking about.

150
00:10:16,603 --> 00:10:17,259
My father didn't

151
00:10:17,363 --> 00:10:18,587
give me anything.

152
00:10:19,539 --> 00:10:21,578
I don't know what
you're talking about.

153
00:10:46,518 --> 00:10:48,262
Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.

154
00:10:48,382 --> 00:10:50,126
How long has it been
since your last confession?

155
00:10:50,525 --> 00:10:51,701
This is my first time.

156
00:10:52,634 --> 00:10:53,718
In a long time.

157
00:10:54,949 --> 00:10:56,750
Are you aware
of the nature of your sins?

158
00:10:58,811 --> 00:10:59,596
The nature?

159
00:11:02,124 --> 00:11:03,292
I'm not really sure.

160
00:11:04,947 --> 00:11:07,124
Deep down inside
your heart, you know.

161
00:11:09,139 --> 00:11:10,739
Righteousness, maybe.

162
00:11:12,378 --> 00:11:14,627
Believing the ends
justify the means.

163
00:11:15,314 --> 00:11:16,418
What are
those ends?

164
00:11:18,482 --> 00:11:19,898
Saving someone's life.

165
00:11:20,927 --> 00:11:21,881
And the means?

166
00:11:23,129 --> 00:11:25,312
I've broken just about
every law you can name.

167
00:11:27,183 --> 00:11:28,864
But it's not
just what I've done.

168
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:32,416
It's what others have done...

169
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:35,351
...because I let them.

170
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:39,870
Because I was doing
what I thought was right.

171
00:11:40,494 --> 00:11:42,030
I should have known
better this time.

172
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:43,165
This time?

173
00:11:46,853 --> 00:11:48,109
When I was a kid...

174
00:11:51,516 --> 00:11:53,781
I watched a man
bleed out and die.

175
00:11:56,938 --> 00:11:58,587
And I was glad...

176
00:12:00,306 --> 00:12:01,722
because he deserved it.

177
00:12:02,314 --> 00:12:02,938
Life is

178
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,681
only for God to give
and take, my son.
Suddenly,

179
00:12:05,883 --> 00:12:08,186
there is this dark space
inside of me.

180
00:12:09,833 --> 00:12:11,369
And I knew
it was wrong.

181
00:12:14,056 --> 00:12:15,448
But here I am.

182
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:16,793
Thereisa way
to stop this.

183
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,672
Surrender
your will to God.

184
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,159
If I surrender now,

185
00:12:23,223 --> 00:12:24,983
I lose everything that I love.

186
00:12:25,558 --> 00:12:29,614
But do you lose your soul
in the process?

187
00:12:33,118 --> 00:12:34,958
Well, we all have
our crosses to bear.

188
00:12:41,525 --> 00:12:42,325
You okay?

189
00:12:46,148 --> 00:12:47,090
This is never gonna stop.

190
00:12:47,187 --> 00:12:48,644
They're gonna keep
coming after us.

191
00:13:04,401 --> 00:13:06,904
Lincoln, don't.

192
00:13:10,358 --> 00:13:11,055
Is it done?

193
00:13:12,205 --> 00:13:13,052
You are.

194
00:13:16,412 --> 00:13:17,380
Lincoln Burrows.

195
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:19,083
Your man's dead.

196
00:13:19,867 --> 00:13:22,578
Just like anyone else you
send to take out my son.

197
00:13:23,242 --> 00:13:24,403
We want you.

198
00:13:24,868 --> 00:13:26,162
This isn't about LJ.

199
00:13:28,385 --> 00:13:29,523
There's a very simple way

200
00:13:29,653 --> 00:13:30,569
for all of this to end.

201
00:13:30,679 --> 00:13:31,677
I'll tell you how
it's going to end--

202
00:13:31,733 --> 00:13:34,500
me staring in your dead eye
with my hand around your throat.

203
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:37,792
You don't even know who I am.

204
00:13:47,016 --> 00:13:47,894
How much further?

205
00:13:58,242 --> 00:13:59,146
Right here is good.

206
00:14:00,066 --> 00:14:01,089
Thanks for the ride.

207
00:15:17,829 --> 00:15:18,749
Agent Mahone.

208
00:15:19,349 --> 00:15:20,005
Bill Kim.

209
00:15:21,693 --> 00:15:22,660
I'm here
to pick you up.

210
00:15:24,915 --> 00:15:25,988
I called Kellerman.

211
00:15:26,883 --> 00:15:28,371
He's busy right now.

212
00:15:30,243 --> 00:15:31,699
Does anyone else
know you're here?

213
00:15:31,828 --> 00:15:33,210
No.
Good.

214
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:34,915
Can you open
the gate?

215
00:15:36,138 --> 00:15:37,746
And I need a new vehicle.

216
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,793
There's something you
should know about me.

217
00:15:41,905 --> 00:15:43,465
I don't like being
out in the field.

218
00:15:43,792 --> 00:15:45,537
I only do so when
there's been a screwup.

219
00:15:48,895 --> 00:15:50,328
I'm out in the field, Alex.

220
00:15:50,448 --> 00:15:51,584
Then why don't you
open the gate?

221
00:15:51,691 --> 00:15:52,711
You can hurry back to D.C.

222
00:15:52,816 --> 00:15:54,630
before your
shoes get dirty.

223
00:15:56,422 --> 00:15:57,831
We have a lead
as to where Burrows

224
00:15:57,936 --> 00:15:59,271
will be meeting up
with his brother.

225
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:01,590
It's a place he referred to
as "Bolshoi Booze."

226
00:16:02,278 --> 00:16:03,438
Does that mean anything to you?

227
00:16:03,534 --> 00:16:05,925
Yeah, it's one of a hundred
tattoos on Scofield's body.

228
00:16:06,349 --> 00:16:07,373
What does it mean?

229
00:16:07,501 --> 00:16:08,573
I don't know yet.

230
00:16:08,997 --> 00:16:09,915
You'll need
to figure it out

231
00:16:10,004 --> 00:16:11,220
within the next
couple of hours.

232
00:16:11,294 --> 00:16:12,393
If Scofield and Burrows
cross the border,

233
00:16:12,536 --> 00:16:14,094
they'll be out
of your jurisdiction,

234
00:16:15,228 --> 00:16:17,341
and you'll be of no
further value to us.

235
00:16:20,212 --> 00:16:21,315
Open the gate.

236
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:22,748
So you can do what?

237
00:16:24,058 --> 00:16:25,044
I want to hear it.

238
00:16:25,171 --> 00:16:26,291
Straight from
the mouth of the guy

239
00:16:26,371 --> 00:16:28,554
who's supposed
to be our closer.
I'll get Scofield

240
00:16:28,954 --> 00:16:31,859
and Burrows...
and all of the rest of them.

241
00:16:32,162 --> 00:16:34,105
And then me and you

242
00:16:34,588 --> 00:16:35,826
and Kellerman,

243
00:16:36,121 --> 00:16:37,569
we're going to part ways.

244
00:16:38,137 --> 00:16:40,209
I just hope you're
properly motivated.

245
00:16:51,583 --> 00:16:54,303
'Cause as long as you do your
job, we'll forget about Shales.

246
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,870
And then you can go back
to Colorado and visit your son.

247
00:17:01,869 --> 00:17:02,853
Cameron.

248
00:17:03,045 --> 00:17:04,436
He's five, right?

249
00:17:06,933 --> 00:17:08,827
Don't you ever mention
his name again.

250
00:17:10,675 --> 00:17:11,811
There he is.

251
00:17:14,403 --> 00:17:15,914
That's what I wanted to hear.

252
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:22,777
Get cracking, Alex.

253
00:17:24,008 --> 00:17:25,513
A lot of people
are relying on you.

254
00:17:33,399 --> 00:17:35,191
Jane will take care of
it; you can trust her.

255
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:38,510
I know this is hard,

256
00:17:38,615 --> 00:17:40,542
but it will work out--
you have my word.

257
00:17:42,903 --> 00:17:44,741
Thank you.
Be careful.

258
00:17:55,059 --> 00:17:56,413
Listen, uh...

259
00:17:58,443 --> 00:17:59,491
I know.

260
00:18:02,434 --> 00:18:03,730
Jane's gonna look after you.

261
00:18:04,658 --> 00:18:05,865
I don't even know her.

262
00:18:05,988 --> 00:18:06,746
She's all right.

263
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:08,466
She's been working
for Dad for a while.

264
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:11,224
I'll, uh...

265
00:18:13,329 --> 00:18:14,937
I'll see you soon, I promise.

266
00:18:17,024 --> 00:18:19,039
Isn't that the same thing
your dad told you?

267
00:18:19,703 --> 00:18:20,943
Yeah, but I mean it.

268
00:18:23,462 --> 00:18:24,495
Hey.

269
00:19:56,432 --> 00:19:57,368
Hey, it's me.

270
00:19:58,831 --> 00:20:00,192
Just call me
when you get this, okay?

271
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,255
It's important.

272
00:20:36,729 --> 00:20:37,826
the numbers...

273
00:21:32,912 --> 00:21:33,936
Is that my payment?

274
00:21:36,305 --> 00:21:37,633
Medical nitroglycerine?

275
00:21:37,944 --> 00:21:39,025
As promised.

276
00:21:45,294 --> 00:21:46,439
Whoo.

277
00:21:47,023 --> 00:21:50,071
You have no idea how hard it is
to get this kind of grade.

278
00:21:51,862 --> 00:21:53,166
Even with my contacts.

279
00:21:53,372 --> 00:21:55,301
It's time for your
end of the deal.

280
00:21:55,596 --> 00:21:57,022
Where's that plane gonna be?

281
00:21:58,189 --> 00:22:01,092
They call me a couple of hours
before with the drop-off point.

282
00:22:01,677 --> 00:22:03,476
It keeps the DEA off our backs.

283
00:22:04,028 --> 00:22:05,252
Since it's going
to be a while,

284
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:07,388
you might want to
stay out of the sun.

285
00:22:14,466 --> 00:22:15,850
Hey, hey, hey.

286
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:17,426
Hey.

287
00:22:19,298 --> 00:22:20,447
Is there a problem?

288
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:22,297
They're my
cousins.

289
00:22:34,975 --> 00:22:37,046
Now, after your
father accessed

290
00:22:37,111 --> 00:22:38,742
this information, he made

291
00:22:40,302 --> 00:22:41,319
three calls

292
00:22:41,478 --> 00:22:43,223
from his cell
phone, all to you.

293
00:22:43,306 --> 00:22:44,501
What did he tell you?

294
00:22:44,661 --> 00:22:46,317
Just that he was
coming back to Chicago.

295
00:22:48,141 --> 00:22:48,828
Good.

296
00:22:49,045 --> 00:22:50,283
You're being honest. Good.

297
00:22:50,404 --> 00:22:53,179
Now, there's a half an hour
between when your father landed

298
00:22:53,237 --> 00:22:56,252
and when he got home
that is unaccounted for.

299
00:22:56,347 --> 00:22:57,316
I know you stopped by
his office.

300
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:58,809
Did you see him there?
No.

301
00:23:00,198 --> 00:23:02,751
The last time I saw my father,
he was dead in his study.

302
00:23:02,846 --> 00:23:04,398
Did your father have anyone
give you anything?

303
00:23:04,574 --> 00:23:06,527
Do you think that I'm just
withholding information

304
00:23:06,582 --> 00:23:08,166
because I like
hanging out with you?

305
00:23:08,275 --> 00:23:09,021
If I knew something,

306
00:23:09,118 --> 00:23:10,228
I would tell
you; I don't.

307
00:23:10,308 --> 00:23:12,349
I don't know anything
about any of this.

308
00:23:12,669 --> 00:23:13,510
Really?

309
00:23:13,757 --> 00:23:15,517
Then why did you give
your father the file

310
00:23:15,581 --> 00:23:16,636
on Lincoln Burrows?

311
00:23:17,668 --> 00:23:19,045
Why did you open the door
for Scofield,

312
00:23:19,084 --> 00:23:20,540
and help him escape?
Why did Scofield

313
00:23:20,631 --> 00:23:22,004
send you those
coded notes?

314
00:23:22,101 --> 00:23:25,156
Why did you come to
New Mexico to meet him?

315
00:23:28,466 --> 00:23:30,931
Don't try to float a babe-
in-the-woods routine by me.

316
00:23:31,066 --> 00:23:32,747
It's really going
to piss me off, so...

317
00:23:33,506 --> 00:23:34,282
Come on.

318
00:23:53,687 --> 00:23:55,278
Shh. Shh-shh.

319
00:23:55,415 --> 00:23:56,327
You're okay.

320
00:23:56,765 --> 00:23:57,839
Shh.

321
00:24:05,041 --> 00:24:07,437
Look, Sara.

322
00:24:09,132 --> 00:24:10,931
We're going to have
to come to an understanding.

323
00:24:21,556 --> 00:24:23,426
Yeah, you were right;
they are coordinates.

324
00:24:23,809 --> 00:24:24,850
Plug them into your GPS.

325
00:24:24,978 --> 00:24:27,074
They'll take you to a spot
in the New Mexico desert.

326
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:28,994
It's in the middle
of nowhere, basically.

327
00:24:29,465 --> 00:24:30,721
Thanks.

328
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:31,857
Yeah, no problem.

329
00:24:32,009 --> 00:24:33,776
Sir, who are you meeting?

330
00:24:35,272 --> 00:24:36,425
What the hell is he doing?

331
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,991
He's keeping us out of the loop,
that's what he's doing.

332
00:24:42,471 --> 00:24:44,687
Constantly running
from the law with
a bad heart...

333
00:24:45,239 --> 00:24:47,207
Mexico, where I'm from
has got a lot of great things,

334
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:50,174
but... health care
ain't one of them.

335
00:24:51,174 --> 00:24:52,078
You all right?

336
00:24:52,965 --> 00:24:54,109
You look
a little nervous.

337
00:24:54,782 --> 00:24:55,925
I don't do this every day.

338
00:24:56,109 --> 00:24:57,869
I just want to get
the information on that plane

339
00:24:57,949 --> 00:24:59,404
and, uh...

340
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:01,076
move on.

341
00:25:01,444 --> 00:25:02,373
Is that it?

342
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:03,556
That's it.

343
00:25:06,075 --> 00:25:07,275
I know who you are.

344
00:25:07,732 --> 00:25:09,491
You don't have
to worry-- we can't

345
00:25:09,579 --> 00:25:11,394
go within 100 feet
of a federal marshal

346
00:25:11,459 --> 00:25:12,419
to collect the reward,

347
00:25:12,499 --> 00:25:15,586
'cause we got U.S. and Mexican
warrants on our heads.

348
00:25:16,114 --> 00:25:18,409
But this plane to Panama...

349
00:25:18,922 --> 00:25:19,956
Sit down.

350
00:25:28,783 --> 00:25:29,976
This is all
for your brother?

351
00:25:30,319 --> 00:25:31,215
Yes.

352
00:25:32,664 --> 00:25:35,160
I got four brothers,
two in prison.

353
00:25:35,526 --> 00:25:37,222
Accept a call? Yes.

354
00:25:38,543 --> 00:25:39,700
But break them out?

355
00:25:40,049 --> 00:25:41,681
Loco.
My brother gave me

356
00:25:41,771 --> 00:25:44,341
a baseball mitt
for my 14th birthday.

357
00:25:45,005 --> 00:25:45,902
I owed him.

358
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:48,019
You're a better man than I am.

359
00:25:48,418 --> 00:25:49,411
Time will tell.

360
00:25:59,225 --> 00:26:01,849
Shouldn't they have
called by now...
about the plane?

361
00:26:02,232 --> 00:26:03,217
Yeah.

362
00:26:03,944 --> 00:26:06,336
You know, I...
I have a question.

363
00:26:08,807 --> 00:26:09,559
I thought

364
00:26:09,704 --> 00:26:11,727
that these came
in glass vials,

365
00:26:13,198 --> 00:26:14,494
not plastic.

366
00:26:16,392 --> 00:26:18,630
I thought so, too, but the guy

367
00:26:18,733 --> 00:26:20,646
I bought it from said
he packed it in plastic

368
00:26:20,726 --> 00:26:23,229
for transportation over long
distances to prevent a fire

369
00:26:23,324 --> 00:26:25,517
or an explosion.

370
00:26:25,781 --> 00:26:26,829
Really?

371
00:26:28,557 --> 00:26:30,012
I never heard of that.

372
00:26:39,907 --> 00:26:41,050
What's going on?

373
00:26:41,541 --> 00:26:43,665
We're going to do
a little quality control test.

374
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:45,281
It's the best available.

375
00:26:45,634 --> 00:26:46,562
We got time.

376
00:27:21,036 --> 00:27:23,596
For the last time,
some black male, early 20s,

377
00:27:23,684 --> 00:27:24,563
jumped me from behind.

378
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:26,235
I didn't get a good look
at his face.

379
00:27:26,314 --> 00:27:27,843
The assailant
attacked you
from behind?

380
00:27:27,947 --> 00:27:28,923
That's what I just said.

381
00:27:29,026 --> 00:27:31,467
Yet he managed to make contact
square on your forehead.

382
00:27:31,570 --> 00:27:32,322
That's right.

383
00:27:32,434 --> 00:27:34,122
With what? A boomerang?

384
00:27:34,187 --> 00:27:35,634
Come on, why don't you
tell me what happened?

385
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:38,997
Look, I'm a retired correctional
officer out of Illinois.

386
00:27:39,637 --> 00:27:42,163
How about showing some
professional courtesy, honey?

387
00:27:51,665 --> 00:27:53,673
This is Roy Geary.
Leave a message.

388
00:27:53,817 --> 00:27:55,705
You thieving son of a bitch.

389
00:27:55,808 --> 00:27:56,841
You better get down
on your knees

390
00:27:56,944 --> 00:27:58,281
and pray to God
that I don't find you,

391
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,697
because, if I do,
mark my words,

392
00:28:01,208 --> 00:28:02,873
I'm going to gut you
bow to stern.

393
00:28:06,151 --> 00:28:08,518
President Reynolds was
in Tallahassee, Florida,

394
00:28:08,608 --> 00:28:10,872
early this morning, attending
a $5,000-a-plate

395
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,461
breakfast fund-raiser
for Senator Martin Kleinhenz,

396
00:28:14,564 --> 00:28:15,867
who's running for reelection.

397
00:28:15,963 --> 00:28:18,643
Later this afternoon, her
press conference was derailed

398
00:28:18,732 --> 00:28:20,363
when a reporter asked her
to comment

399
00:28:20,452 --> 00:28:22,891
on Lincoln Burrows'
escape from custody.

400
00:28:23,194 --> 00:28:24,067
She declined.

401
00:28:24,547 --> 00:28:26,802
It's become clear
in her first month in office

402
00:28:26,906 --> 00:28:29,945
that she cannot separate herself
from this manhunt.

403
00:28:30,225 --> 00:28:31,128
And as long as it continues...

404
00:28:31,599 --> 00:28:34,678
...pundits say that questions
about Burrows will contin...

405
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:40,612
Ladies.

406
00:28:41,221 --> 00:28:42,955
Let's get this party started.

407
00:28:44,355 --> 00:28:46,419
The last 30 years,
I've hated you.

408
00:28:46,714 --> 00:28:47,691
You walked out on me.

409
00:28:50,442 --> 00:28:51,913
You haven't even
seen Michael.

410
00:28:54,282 --> 00:28:55,521
I've seen him before.

411
00:28:57,161 --> 00:28:58,560
Not in the papers, Dad.

412
00:29:00,609 --> 00:29:03,321
Been trying to work out what
kind of man abandons his family.

413
00:29:06,096 --> 00:29:07,847
Now I'm doing
the same damn thing.

414
00:29:10,647 --> 00:29:11,743
You'll see him again.

415
00:29:12,231 --> 00:29:13,463
I'll make sure of it.

416
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:18,797
How much further?

417
00:29:18,951 --> 00:29:20,078
About three hours.

418
00:29:27,924 --> 00:29:29,060
It's gonna be a few minutes.

419
00:29:29,189 --> 00:29:30,275
My brother should
be here soon.

420
00:29:30,507 --> 00:29:33,012
Maybe I should go outside
and make sure he can see me.

421
00:29:33,115 --> 00:29:33,812
That's a good idea.

422
00:29:33,915 --> 00:29:35,427
I think I'm gonna
send Ernesto to do it.

423
00:29:35,531 --> 00:29:36,459
Ernesto, por favor.

424
00:29:49,432 --> 00:29:50,168
Hello.

425
00:29:51,028 --> 00:29:51,680
Si.

426
00:29:54,096 --> 00:29:55,024
Bueno, te veo.

427
00:30:01,631 --> 00:30:02,704
Was that the call?

428
00:30:03,247 --> 00:30:03,950
Yes, it was.

429
00:30:04,679 --> 00:30:05,646
About the plane?

430
00:30:09,288 --> 00:30:10,102
¿Como se llamas?

431
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:11,734
Agua con azucar.

432
00:30:12,271 --> 00:30:13,487
Sugar water.

433
00:30:14,183 --> 00:30:16,046
You just made a big mistake,
blanquito.

434
00:30:16,143 --> 00:30:17,558
I'm sorry, I'm
sorry, okay?

435
00:30:17,638 --> 00:30:18,534
I'm not a chemist.

436
00:30:18,797 --> 00:30:20,885
The guy I bought it from
swore it was medical nitro.

437
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:23,432
We both got screwed.

438
00:30:23,518 --> 00:30:24,923
Yeah, but only one of us
is gonna pay for it.

439
00:30:25,002 --> 00:30:25,733
Look, I just want to get

440
00:30:25,811 --> 00:30:27,402
out of here,
and you want your payment.

441
00:30:27,513 --> 00:30:28,766
My brother's gonna
be here soon.

442
00:30:30,175 --> 00:30:31,311
We'll work something out.

443
00:30:31,447 --> 00:30:32,415
Just name your price.

444
00:30:32,991 --> 00:30:34,215
I already named my price.

445
00:30:35,654 --> 00:30:37,029
You didn't go through.

446
00:30:46,724 --> 00:30:47,598
When's your brother
getting here?

447
00:30:48,164 --> 00:30:50,988
You were planning on turning us
in the whole time, weren't you?

448
00:30:51,284 --> 00:30:52,762
When's he supposed
to meet you here?!

449
00:30:52,868 --> 00:30:53,581
Sueltalo.

450
00:30:54,787 --> 00:30:55,891
Drop it, or I'm gonna
shoot him.

451
00:30:56,028 --> 00:30:57,211
Let him go, or I'll shoot you.

452
00:30:57,315 --> 00:30:59,131
Suelta la pistola.
Ey, no estoy judiendo.

453
00:30:59,259 --> 00:30:59,929
Sueltala, cabron!

454
00:31:17,721 --> 00:31:18,406
Where is it?

455
00:31:18,527 --> 00:31:20,495
My father didn't
give me anything.

456
00:31:23,758 --> 00:31:25,357
Who you risking
your life for?

457
00:31:27,573 --> 00:31:28,718
Lincoln Burrows.

458
00:31:30,685 --> 00:31:31,646
Street thug.

459
00:31:33,653 --> 00:31:34,853
And why is that your concern?

460
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:36,837
I mean, is there somewhere
in the Hippocratic Oath

461
00:31:36,909 --> 00:31:38,896
where it says,
"I pledge to risk my life

462
00:31:39,308 --> 00:31:40,849
for those who don't care
about mine"?

463
00:31:40,946 --> 00:31:43,189
'Cause they don't
care about yours.

464
00:31:43,399 --> 00:31:45,415
Burrows
and Michael Scofield

465
00:31:45,831 --> 00:31:46,693
just used you.

466
00:31:48,311 --> 00:31:50,197
Are you that surprised that
there are people in the world

467
00:31:50,302 --> 00:31:51,750
who will stand up
to people like you?

468
00:31:52,597 --> 00:31:53,789
Are you that far gone?

469
00:31:54,581 --> 00:31:55,484
That's cute.

470
00:31:56,452 --> 00:31:57,213
Sad.

471
00:31:59,363 --> 00:32:00,420
But cute.

472
00:32:15,986 --> 00:32:17,530
A Cleveland what?

473
00:32:17,634 --> 00:32:18,954
Don't worry,
I'll talk you through it.

474
00:32:19,554 --> 00:32:20,237
And we got

475
00:32:20,272 --> 00:32:21,816
a glass coffee table
right here.

476
00:32:25,024 --> 00:32:25,993
Hell no.

477
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,080
I'll do it
for a thousand.

478
00:32:27,808 --> 00:32:28,527
$500.

479
00:32:29,823 --> 00:32:31,087
$1,000.

480
00:32:31,672 --> 00:32:33,318
$750.

481
00:32:34,798 --> 00:32:35,862
All right.

482
00:32:48,741 --> 00:32:49,964
What the hell?

483
00:33:01,025 --> 00:33:02,418
Leave.

484
00:33:06,522 --> 00:33:07,514
You know,

485
00:33:08,401 --> 00:33:11,145
it's amazing what you
can pick up

486
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:12,945
at an Army-Navy store.

487
00:33:13,848 --> 00:33:16,049
All that torture stuff,
that was Bellick's idea.

488
00:33:16,169 --> 00:33:18,703
And if you ask me, he took
the whole thing way too far.

489
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:20,000
Listen,

490
00:33:20,119 --> 00:33:21,991
why don't I just give
you half the money,
and we call it a day?

491
00:33:22,807 --> 00:33:24,088
All right, 60-40.

492
00:33:24,887 --> 00:33:26,438
Come on, T,
we can deal.

493
00:33:32,861 --> 00:33:33,934
Where's the plane
going to land?

494
00:33:35,221 --> 00:33:36,404
Kiss my ass, cobarde.

495
00:33:42,494 --> 00:33:43,418
What are we going to do?

496
00:33:43,885 --> 00:33:45,483
I don't know yet.

497
00:33:45,915 --> 00:33:48,160
We're not going to get across
the border on the ground.

498
00:33:48,392 --> 00:33:49,937
Without that plane,
we're screwed.

499
00:33:50,104 --> 00:33:51,288
He's losing too much blood.

500
00:33:51,393 --> 00:33:52,960
He'll never make it like this.
He should have thought

501
00:33:53,024 --> 00:33:54,087
of that before he tried
to kill us.

502
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,303
We got to take him
to a hospital,

503
00:33:55,471 --> 00:33:56,551
or else he'll die.

504
00:33:57,576 --> 00:33:58,249
Please.

505
00:34:00,926 --> 00:34:02,390
The plane,
and we'll let you go.

506
00:34:03,367 --> 00:34:04,046
Dicelo.

507
00:34:05,094 --> 00:34:06,078
Dicelo todo.

508
00:34:07,172 --> 00:34:08,301
Dicelo ahora!

509
00:34:15,541 --> 00:34:16,804
Finley Road...

510
00:34:17,604 --> 00:34:19,811
off of Highway 8,
there's an airstrip.

511
00:34:19,917 --> 00:34:22,495
There, okay?
Now let us go.

512
00:34:22,626 --> 00:34:23,645
Let's go.
No, no, no!

513
00:34:23,797 --> 00:34:24,700
Michael, let's go.

514
00:34:24,878 --> 00:34:26,829
Por favor... please.

515
00:34:27,103 --> 00:34:28,257
Michael, let's go.

516
00:34:29,372 --> 00:34:32,664
Don't do this,
please don't do this.

517
00:34:32,839 --> 00:34:34,277
Let's go, Michael.

518
00:34:34,428 --> 00:34:35,104
If we were bleeding

519
00:34:35,181 --> 00:34:36,383
he would have not lifted
a finger,

520
00:34:36,439 --> 00:34:38,007
you know that--
he was gonna kill us both.

521
00:34:38,247 --> 00:34:39,669
Let's go.
No, that's not true.

522
00:34:40,213 --> 00:34:41,797
Michael, we're going to
get to that plane...

523
00:34:41,877 --> 00:34:42,669
Don't do this.

524
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:44,187
Let's go now, please.

525
00:34:44,309 --> 00:34:45,659
Please don't do this, okay?!

526
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:46,731
Callate!
Don't do this.

527
00:34:47,012 --> 00:34:47,811
Don't do, all right?

528
00:34:47,891 --> 00:34:48,676
Don't listen to him!

529
00:34:49,956 --> 00:34:50,684
Please.

530
00:34:55,234 --> 00:34:56,186
Sara, I care about you.

531
00:34:57,570 --> 00:35:00,098
This is not what I wanted, Sara.

532
00:35:12,792 --> 00:35:13,486
Kellerman.

533
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,047
What's going on with Sara?

534
00:35:15,791 --> 00:35:16,775
Has she told you anything?

535
00:35:20,334 --> 00:35:21,310
Don't go anywhere.

536
00:35:21,862 --> 00:35:22,599
Not yet.

537
00:35:22,846 --> 00:35:25,062
I trust you've been...
persuasive.

538
00:35:25,542 --> 00:35:26,509
Yes, absolutely.

539
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:28,277
Then kill her.

540
00:35:31,477 --> 00:35:32,819
Well, she knows something.

541
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:36,163
You disobey me, you are done.

542
00:35:37,756 --> 00:35:38,755
Do you understand me?

543
00:35:40,491 --> 00:35:42,179
Put her in the ground, Paul?

544
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:29,800
Michael.

545
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:32,100
Let's go.

546
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:33,800
Michael.
Hold still.

547
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:37,100
Michael, we're doing it wrong--
let's get out of here.

548
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,700
Now, he's gonna
call the cops,

549
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:40,600
or go get his buddies...
He's not going
to make it.

550
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:41,700
You have to...
Callate!

551
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,100
We'll call them
when we get safe.

552
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:45,100
Let's go-- Michael, let's go!

553
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,600
Thank you.

554
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:49,600
You got to get him to a hospital
right away.

555
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,700
Okay.

556
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:05,800
Wait. Wait.

557
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,100
Hey, man...

558
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,400
Forget Finley Road.

559
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,900
The plane is going to stop
at the seven mile marker

560
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,800
on Route 4 at sunset.

561
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,600
It's going to stop
for five minutes.

562
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:18,900
Then it's going to go

563
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:20,300
to Oaxaca, Mexico.

564
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:23,200
If you miss it,
you're out of luck.

565
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,600
He bled out on the way over.

566
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:36,700
Any ID?

567
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,900
Yeah, Roy Geary,
just an out-of-stater.

568
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:51,600
You know him?

569
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:53,000
He's a friend of mine.

570
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:54,900
Mr. Bellick?

571
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:55,700
Yeah.

572
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,700
You mind answering
a few more questions?

573
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:09,900
Yeah.

574
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,000
It's Pam.

575
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:14,600
What's going on?

576
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:18,200
I just wanted to say hey.

577
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:20,900
Well... are you all right?

578
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,400
You said it was important.

579
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:27,800
I know things got kind of ugly
toward the...

580
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,800
you know, the end.

581
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,600
Um... I got ugly.

582
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:37,200
But I want you to know that,
that there were circumstances

583
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,400
that, uh...

584
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:41,800
It was better that you
and Cameron

585
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:45,000
that you were not with me.

586
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,900
Why are you telling me this now?

587
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:50,200
If I had to do it
all over again...

588
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:53,300
I'd do it different.

589
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:57,800
We'd still be a family.

590
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:00,900
I'd give anything for that.

591
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,700
I just wanted you to know.

592
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Alex...

593
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:07,700
what's going on?

594
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,000
Nothing.

595
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:12,100
I just wanted to call to say
that I was, uh....

596
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:15,700
...that I'm sorry

597
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
about everything.

598
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:20,600
Where are you right now?

599
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:22,200
I can come get you.

600
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:23,600
Wouldn't that be nice, huh?

601
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:25,800
No, I'm serious.
Where are you?

602
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:27,300
One more thing.

603
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,600
If you hear anything
in the media...

604
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:31,600
What?

605
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,300
What are you talking about?

606
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:32,900
Well... I'm glad I told you
about this place.

607
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:35,200
I'm glad I figured
out how to work a GPS.

608
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:36,900
Could you make it a little more
difficult next time?

609
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,100
I owe you one.

610
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,800
We're even.

611
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:40,900
But we got to leave.

612
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:44,100
Linc.

613
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,100
Hey, buddy.

614
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:47,800
How are you doing?

615
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:50,000
Where's LJ?
Safe.

616
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:52,300
The money?
I'll tell you later;
we got to go.

617
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:53,400
I brought someone.

618
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:55,800
Dad?

619
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:12,200
We've met before.

620
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:40,000
This is happening
right now, okay?

621
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:43,300
Don't make me do this.

622
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:46,400
Even if I knew,
I wouldn't tell you.

623
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,000
You wouldn't? Really?

624
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,700
Are you that stupid?

625
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,500
Are you that stupid?!

626
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:53,700
Because now
you're going to die!

627
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:56,000
You're going to die,
and all you had to do

628
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,500
is tell me
what your father gave you.

629
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:01,100
I know my options.

630
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,900
I can not tell you and die,
or I can tell you

631
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:04,800
and still die.

632
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:07,300
No. Wrong.

633
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,200
Sara.

634
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:10,100
Come on, smarten up!

635
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,100
For once in your life.

636
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:13,800
Please.

637
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:23,300
Go to hell.

638
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:32,900
Huh? Drowning is horrific--
don't get me wrong--

639
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,900
but once you give in and let
the water come into your lungs,

640
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:36,900
there's a certain

641
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,700
euphoria... I hear.

642
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:40,700
I guess as a junkie,

643
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:42,400
I thought maybe
you'd appreciate that.

644
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:47,600
You did this to yourself.

645
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:08,200
