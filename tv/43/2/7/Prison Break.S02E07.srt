1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:01,905
previously on Prison Break:

2
00:00:01,905 --> 00:00:02,839
The ranch is
gone, Michael.

3
00:00:02,905 --> 00:00:04,205
We gotta do something,

4
00:00:04,272 --> 00:00:04,694
and it's not going
to involve hurting you.

5
00:00:04,695 --> 00:00:05,929
I got an idea.

6
00:00:07,129 --> 00:00:08,494
Sorry to bother you, ma'am.

7
00:00:08,495 --> 00:00:09,896
Is your
electricity out?

8
00:00:09,962 --> 00:00:11,629
Those cons are in one
of these towns

9
00:00:11,695 --> 00:00:14,163
and couldn't have gone further
than 64 miles in any direction.

10
00:00:14,229 --> 00:00:16,595
I want everything
you've got in that perimeter.

11
00:00:16,662 --> 00:00:18,996
Well, to be honest, uh...

12
00:00:19,062 --> 00:00:21,196
I was expecting
to brief the president.

13
00:00:21,263 --> 00:00:22,629
You report to me now.

14
00:00:22,695 --> 00:00:25,462
Frankly, the biggest issue
we have to address,

15
00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:27,462
are the charges
facing your daughter.

16
00:00:27,529 --> 00:00:28,629
Good to meet you, sir.

17
00:00:29,562 --> 00:00:31,362
Sara, do you remember that guy

18
00:00:31,428 --> 00:00:33,328
that I met with you
in your apartment?

19
00:00:33,395 --> 00:00:35,295
I want you
to stay away from him.

20
00:00:35,362 --> 00:00:36,142
What are you talking about?

21
00:00:36,143 --> 00:00:38,311
??

22
00:00:39,417 --> 00:00:40,582
Where is that?

23
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:42,350
It's Holland.

24
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:44,150
It's beautiful.

25
00:00:44,216 --> 00:00:45,449
And that's for the car.

26
00:00:45,516 --> 00:00:47,283
We'll meet you right
back here in an hour.

27
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:48,549
(siren blaring)

28
00:00:48,616 --> 00:00:51,683
Put your hands behind your head
and drop to your knees.

29
00:00:55,749 --> 00:00:58,083
Don't say a word,
you little fools]

30
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:00,675
or I'm gonna cut
urG@oat out.

31
00:01:01,683 --> 00:01:03,994
Ah! Oh, please!

32
00:01:03,994 --> 00:01:05,675
T-BAG:
You tr again,
I'll pry those

33
00:01:05,676 --> 00:01:07,442
vocal chords right
out of your throat.

34
00:01:14,109 --> 00:01:15,009
Whoing?

35
00:01:17,082 --> 00:01:19,416
MICHAEL:
She's coming up.

36
00:01:35,882 --> 00:01:37,182
Mom, you home?

37
00:01:54,049 --> 00:01:56,015
Mom?

38
00:02:45,449 --> 00:02:47,049
Back away
and put your hands up.

39
00:02:47,116 --> 00:02:47,949
Just go easy.

40
00:02:48,015 --> 00:02:49,815
Go nothing.
She ain't the one

41
00:02:49,882 --> 00:02:50,949
carrying the cards here.

42
00:02:51,015 --> 00:02:53,382
Back away and put your hands up.

43
00:02:53,449 --> 00:02:54,815
I put my hand up,

44
00:02:54,882 --> 00:02:56,982
I'll take her jugular with it.

45
00:02:57,049 --> 00:02:59,116
I don't want anyone
to do anything stupid, okay?

46
00:03:05,949 --> 00:03:07,382
Uh! Let's be civil here.

47
00:03:07,449 --> 00:03:10,116
Stop. Relax.

48
00:03:10,182 --> 00:03:11,464
You can go.

49
00:03:11,465 --> 00:03:13,866
Guy at the garden center said
Burrows was strong as a gorilla.

50
00:03:13,932 --> 00:03:16,099
It was 1:00 p.m.
when they tangled it up.

51
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:18,831
The guy ID'd both of them--
Scofield, Burrows.

52
00:03:18,831 --> 00:03:20,232
No doubt about it
in his mind.

53
00:03:20,298 --> 00:03:21,723
Of course, given
that was 1:00 p.m.,

54
00:03:21,724 --> 00:03:23,724
those two could be 300 miles
from here by now.

55
00:03:23,791 --> 00:03:26,122
You have a half a dozen picks,
shovels and power tools

56
00:03:26,123 --> 00:03:27,056
missing from that store.

57
00:03:27,057 --> 00:03:28,157
They're here and
they're digging.

58
00:03:28,224 --> 00:03:29,456
Five million dollars

59
00:03:29,523 --> 00:03:31,391
buried somewhere beneath
the streets of Tooele.

60
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:32,572
You really believe that?

61
00:03:32,573 --> 00:03:35,041
They believe that, and
that's the important thing.

62
00:03:35,107 --> 00:03:36,373
They could be anywhere now.

63
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,373
We don't have

64
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,041
the units to go
door-to-door.

65
00:03:39,107 --> 00:03:41,437
We won't need them.

66
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,874
He's going to tell us
where to look.

70
00:04:25,113 --> 00:04:26,113
??

71
00:04:26,146 --> 00:04:27,454
I was just about to text you.

72
00:04:27,455 --> 00:04:29,341
Today's your
lucky day.
Is it?

73
00:04:29,342 --> 00:04:33,144
Yeah, my Aunt Maxine
finally gave me

74
00:04:33,144 --> 00:04:35,676
her famous chocolate chip
cookie recipe

75
00:04:35,677 --> 00:04:37,076
and if you're free tonight,

76
00:04:37,143 --> 00:04:39,210
I'd love for you
to be my guinea pig.

77
00:04:39,277 --> 00:04:40,143
Uh... I can't.

78
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:41,544
Not tonight.

79
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:42,577
Come on. You sound

80
00:04:42,644 --> 00:04:44,475
just like Daniel. Not tonight.

81
00:04:44,476 --> 00:04:45,759
Not tonight.
You know what?

82
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,894
if you don't mind,
I've actually gotta go.

83
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,226
Um...

84
00:04:49,293 --> 00:04:52,178
Are you okay? I mean,

85
00:04:52,178 --> 00:04:53,211
your cart's empty.

86
00:04:53,278 --> 00:04:55,979
I'm good. Thanks. Just gotta go.

87
00:04:56,044 --> 00:04:57,011
Sara.

88
00:05:12,078 --> 00:05:14,512
This is going wrong
in every possible way.

89
00:05:14,578 --> 00:05:16,411
This is stupid, man.
We can <i>not</i> do this.

90
00:05:16,478 --> 00:05:18,345
Hat's over the wall now.

91
00:05:18,411 --> 00:05:20,445
C-NOTE:
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

92
00:05:22,078 --> 00:05:23,979
I mean we committed.

93
00:05:24,044 --> 00:05:25,512
It's time to go
get the hat.

94
00:05:25,578 --> 00:05:27,411
We don't have a choice.

95
00:05:27,478 --> 00:05:29,497
Yeah, we do.
We can walk

96
00:05:29,497 --> 00:05:31,330
right up out of here
right now, man.

97
00:05:31,397 --> 00:05:32,364
T-BAG.
And then what?

98
00:05:33,317 --> 00:05:35,517
We are already in the house.

99
00:05:35,584 --> 00:05:36,950
Those women are bound.

100
00:05:37,017 --> 00:05:38,717
We have already
committed this crime.

101
00:05:38,783 --> 00:05:40,916
We leave, it ain't
gonna change any of that.

102
00:05:44,717 --> 00:05:46,150
Why couldn't there
just be a silo

103
00:05:46,217 --> 00:05:49,083
in the middle of a field
with no one around?

104
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,517
We'll figure it out.

105
00:05:51,584 --> 00:05:52,983
We can get the money
another way.

106
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:54,651
Yeah, maybe I can
rob another bank.

107
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:59,550
You know what Charles
once said to me?

108
00:05:59,617 --> 00:06:02,983
He said there's no
such thing as an ex-con.

109
00:06:04,331 --> 00:06:05,383
Because I used to think

110
00:06:05,384 --> 00:06:08,950
there was a way we could
wipe the slate clean,

111
00:06:10,654 --> 00:06:14,154
make up for
everything
we've done.

112
00:06:15,983 --> 00:06:17,651
The hat's over the wall, Linc.

113
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:21,617
For everyone.

114
00:06:30,217 --> 00:06:33,250
"Sorry" isn't going to mean
anything to you right now,

115
00:06:33,317 --> 00:06:35,717
but I want to
say it anyway.

116
00:06:37,983 --> 00:06:40,450
This wasn't supposed to happen.

117
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:46,050
One or two hours tops
and we'll be out of here,

118
00:06:46,117 --> 00:06:47,783
and you have my word,

119
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:49,584
no one will harm you.

120
00:06:53,284 --> 00:06:56,050
Keep your eyes open, okay?

121
00:06:56,117 --> 00:06:57,484
Nothing happens
to them.

122
00:06:58,517 --> 00:07:00,384
Nothing.

123
00:07:11,617 --> 00:07:14,484
KELLERMAN:
 <i>The doctor is suspicious.</i>

124
00:07:15,751 --> 00:07:17,081
She should be.

125
00:07:17,082 --> 00:07:19,347
She was on the line with the
governor when you walked up.

126
00:07:19,348 --> 00:07:20,415
You <i>were</i> listening.

127
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:22,348
Both lines are tapped.

128
00:07:22,415 --> 00:07:23,415
We're not rookies.

129
00:07:23,481 --> 00:07:26,481
Father tell her what you know?

130
00:07:26,548 --> 00:07:29,181
Not over the phone.

131
00:07:29,248 --> 00:07:30,682
But he knows who <i>you</i> are,

132
00:07:30,748 --> 00:07:32,548
and so does she.

133
00:07:34,187 --> 00:07:34,958
Seeing how she was

134
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:37,059
supposed to lead you to Scofield
and eventually to Burrows,

135
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:38,442
it looks like we're back
to square one.

136
00:07:38,443 --> 00:07:39,409
Not necessarily.

137
00:07:39,476 --> 00:07:41,576
There are other people
they care about.

138
00:07:41,643 --> 00:07:42,710
The kid.

139
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:47,266
In terms of the governor...

140
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:50,033
Burrows' kid, Paul.

141
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,066
Focus.

142
00:08:00,756 --> 00:08:02,056
Governor Tancredi's office.
Please hold.

143
00:08:03,282 --> 00:08:04,215
Governor
Tancredi's office.

144
00:08:04,282 --> 00:08:05,249
Hold, please.

145
00:08:05,315 --> 00:08:06,516
Hey, is, is my father in?

146
00:08:06,581 --> 00:08:07,548
Just a second.
(phone ringing)

147
00:08:07,615 --> 00:08:09,315
Governor Tancredi's
office.

148
00:08:09,382 --> 00:08:10,734
Hey, Bruce.
Oh, hi, Sara.

149
00:08:10,735 --> 00:08:11,900
I'm trying to get a hold of Dad.

150
00:08:11,901 --> 00:08:13,368
I need to reach him
on his cell.

151
00:08:13,435 --> 00:08:15,351
He actually just landed.
Should be home soon.

152
00:08:15,352 --> 00:08:16,952
Okay.
I don't know if
he's going to be

153
00:08:17,018 --> 00:08:18,618
in much of a mood
to talk, though.
Why?

154
00:08:18,685 --> 00:08:20,917
Your father got a call
from the White House.

155
00:08:20,918 --> 00:08:21,852
They withdrew his nomination.

156
00:08:23,232 --> 00:08:24,332
What?

157
00:08:24,349 --> 00:08:25,455
I talked to him two hours ago.

158
00:08:25,456 --> 00:08:26,790
He didn't say
anything about that.

159
00:08:26,857 --> 00:08:27,823
It just happened.

160
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:29,423
According to them,
his confirmation

161
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:30,989
was going to be a problem.

162
00:08:31,056 --> 00:08:34,056
We had the votes, right?

163
00:08:34,122 --> 00:08:35,389
Super majority.

164
00:08:35,456 --> 00:08:37,823
Okay. So...

165
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:39,790
President Reynolds pulled
the plug on a sure thing

166
00:08:39,857 --> 00:08:42,122
in order to start over
from scratch?

167
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:44,590
How often does something
like that happen in politics?

168
00:08:44,656 --> 00:08:46,756
Never.

169
00:08:53,122 --> 00:08:54,656
Since when did we
become kidnappers?

170
00:08:54,723 --> 00:08:56,356
It ain't right.

171
00:08:56,423 --> 00:08:58,056
MAN (on TV):
Without a doubt...

172
00:08:58,122 --> 00:09:00,323
MICHAEL:
Well, we can buy
a conscience tomorrow.

173
00:09:00,389 --> 00:09:01,590
Yeah, well, yeah.

174
00:09:01,656 --> 00:09:04,022
Closing your eyes
ain't gonna make it go away.

175
00:09:04,089 --> 00:09:02,223
...death row inmates...

176
00:09:04,789 --> 00:09:05,888
I'll take five minutes

177
00:09:05,889 --> 00:09:07,990
of a situation
I can control

178
00:09:08,056 --> 00:09:11,889
over 50 years
of one I can't any day.

179
00:09:11,956 --> 00:09:14,190
Hey, Mr. Hundred Dollar Bill.

180
00:09:14,256 --> 00:09:15,856
Uh, what's it
like being

181
00:09:15,923 --> 00:09:17,990
with the African persuasion
anyhow?

182
00:09:18,037 --> 00:09:19,155
You shut the hell up.

183
00:09:19,156 --> 00:09:21,023
Oh, hit me a nerve.

184
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:22,990
Fox River is the exception
to the rule.

185
00:09:23,056 --> 00:09:24,156
The system is...

186
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:26,689
Why don't you get down
in that hole and dig, man?

187
00:09:26,756 --> 00:09:28,689
Oh, yeah. How about you
backin' up, dark fella?

188
00:09:28,756 --> 00:09:31,723
You're a long way away
from home, trailer park.

189
00:09:32,523 --> 00:09:34,020
I can put you in that hole,

190
00:09:34,021 --> 00:09:35,555
and nobody would ever
hear you scream.

191
00:09:35,621 --> 00:09:36,921
Knock it off.

192
00:09:36,987 --> 00:09:38,787
We have security expert
Marc Bruni with us

193
00:09:38,854 --> 00:09:40,020
who will explain

194
00:09:40,021 --> 00:09:43,973
how other prisons are ensuring
that they are not victimized

195
00:09:43,974 --> 00:09:46,559
by the next Fox River Eight.

196
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,860
T-BAG:
Should be
the Fox River Seven

197
00:09:48,926 --> 00:09:51,827
now that Abruzzi's
taken his dirt nap.

198
00:09:51,894 --> 00:09:53,926
God rest the man's soul,
of course.

199
00:09:53,993 --> 00:09:56,794
Speaking of numbers,
we're short one.

200
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:59,827
Kid's taken a long time
to fill that gas tank up.

201
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:12,827
Leaned on him
in every way
I can think of.

202
00:10:12,894 --> 00:10:14,926
He's, uh...
he's not talking.

203
00:10:31,775 --> 00:10:32,820
Are you Catholic?

204
00:10:35,142 --> 00:10:37,209
Are you Catholic?

205
00:10:41,527 --> 00:10:43,460
Not much good in it.

206
00:10:43,527 --> 00:10:44,860
Lot of guilt.

207
00:10:48,126 --> 00:10:50,794
But the one good thing
is confession.

208
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,460
Whatever you got eating

209
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:55,460
at you, you just...

210
00:10:55,527 --> 00:10:57,560
give it up.

211
00:10:57,627 --> 00:10:59,627
Feels good,
I have to say.

212
00:11:01,493 --> 00:11:03,460
Guess it's letting it out.

213
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:06,827
Letting another
human being hear it.

214
00:11:06,894 --> 00:11:09,293
I ain't got nothin'
to say to you, man.

215
00:11:15,126 --> 00:11:18,226
What if I told <i>you</i> something?

216
00:11:18,293 --> 00:11:20,993
A secret
nobody else knew.

217
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:26,380
Oscar Shales...

218
00:11:32,393 --> 00:11:36,059
Guy I was chasing
a few years back.

219
00:11:36,126 --> 00:11:38,293
Smart as hell.

220
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,860
I...

221
00:11:39,926 --> 00:11:42,959
kept just missing him.

222
00:11:43,026 --> 00:11:46,160
It became kind of a game,
like, uh, chess.

223
00:11:46,226 --> 00:11:48,126
Would've almost been fun

224
00:11:48,193 --> 00:11:49,760
if it weren't for the fact

225
00:11:49,827 --> 00:11:53,427
that he was killing people
all along the way.

226
00:11:55,527 --> 00:11:58,126
Bodies kept stacking up,
and I started

227
00:11:58,193 --> 00:12:01,226
(chuckles):
to feel that
it was because of me.

228
00:12:01,293 --> 00:12:04,126
Because I couldn't do my job.

229
00:12:04,193 --> 00:12:07,326
Because I wasn't smart enough.

230
00:12:12,093 --> 00:12:14,315
Never did catch him,

231
00:12:14,498 --> 00:12:16,414
but I did lose him.

232
00:12:19,727 --> 00:12:22,860
I saw things
when I would drive at night:

233
00:12:22,926 --> 00:12:24,894
bodies...

234
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,627
nightmares to the point
that I couldn't sleep.

235
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,326
It...

236
00:12:31,393 --> 00:12:34,160
was a complete break
from reality.

237
00:12:36,059 --> 00:12:39,059
That's what these
little guys are for.

238
00:12:39,126 --> 00:12:42,059
To keep me in the game.

239
00:12:45,193 --> 00:12:47,860
So now you know.

240
00:12:47,926 --> 00:12:50,527
Now it's off <i>my</i> chest.

241
00:12:50,593 --> 00:12:52,827
Ought to try it
sometime.

242
00:13:05,794 --> 00:13:09,093
Like I said before...

243
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,560
I ain't gonna tell you nothin'.

244
00:13:11,627 --> 00:13:14,093
You know where those guys are.

245
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:18,727
If you're looking for a rat,
you got the wrong guy, man.

246
00:13:18,794 --> 00:13:22,831
Nah, I'm just trying
to spare you some guilt.

247
00:13:26,907 --> 00:13:29,692
Bagwell was free less
than 24 hours before he killed

248
00:13:29,693 --> 00:13:32,193
his first victim.

249
00:13:35,134 --> 00:13:37,188
If you don't tell me
where he is now,

250
00:13:37,189 --> 00:13:38,889
he's gonna kill again,

251
00:13:38,956 --> 00:13:41,755
and that blood is gonna be
on your conscience

252
00:13:41,822 --> 00:13:43,588
and nobody else's.

253
00:13:49,089 --> 00:13:51,755
Confession might not be
such a bad thing, huh?

254
00:14:00,522 --> 00:14:03,356
He just arrived, LJ.
That's impossible.

255
00:14:03,423 --> 00:14:07,090
I-I don't have a meeting
scheduled with my lawyer.

256
00:14:09,588 --> 00:14:11,655
He's a court-appointed
public defender in Illinois.

257
00:14:11,722 --> 00:14:14,588
I doubt he would come to
Arizona without calling me.

258
00:14:14,589 --> 00:14:16,322
Let's go.

259
00:14:46,337 --> 00:14:47,803
Yeah.

260
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:50,469
MAN:
We're all set in Arizona
with the Burrows kid.

261
00:14:50,536 --> 00:14:51,870
KELLERMAN:
Good.

262
00:14:51,937 --> 00:14:53,542
The kid's as good as gone.

263
00:15:00,569 --> 00:15:02,937
What'd you say the name
of that lawyer was?

264
00:15:03,003 --> 00:15:04,153
Didn't give it to me.

265
00:15:04,154 --> 00:15:05,453
Gave it to the warden.

266
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,252
Then I want to talk
to the warden.

267
00:15:07,253 --> 00:15:08,453
Hey, you hear me?

268
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,653
After.

269
00:15:36,689 --> 00:15:38,322
Hello, LJ.

270
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:39,772
What do you want?

271
00:15:39,773 --> 00:15:40,772
They didn't tell you

272
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,140
why I came here?

273
00:15:42,207 --> 00:15:43,307
No.

274
00:15:43,373 --> 00:15:46,507
I'm an ADA
here in Mohave County.

275
00:15:46,574 --> 00:15:48,773
I'm here to serve you
with these.

276
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:50,873
What are those?

277
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:52,806
Your release papers.

278
00:16:11,668 --> 00:16:13,030
Hey, Matt.
Ms. Tancredi.

279
00:16:13,031 --> 00:16:14,964
Is my dad in?
In his study.

280
00:16:15,031 --> 00:16:16,328
Great. Thank you.

281
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:21,098
Hey, Dad?

282
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,300
help

283
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:01,654
I need my pill.

284
00:17:01,655 --> 00:17:03,355
(muffled):
Please, I need my pill.

285
00:17:09,322 --> 00:17:10,622
What?

286
00:17:10,689 --> 00:17:12,471
I need my pills.

287
00:17:12,472 --> 00:17:15,005
Forget it.
No, you don't understand;
I need them.

288
00:17:16,405 --> 00:17:17,939
They're for my baby.

289
00:17:18,005 --> 00:17:20,504
They're Metformin
to prevent a miscarriage.

290
00:17:20,505 --> 00:17:22,139
Please.

291
00:17:23,206 --> 00:17:25,672
They're in the drawer
in the kitchen.

292
00:17:27,373 --> 00:17:28,872
That one right there.

293
00:17:32,465 --> 00:17:33,414
How many?

294
00:17:33,415 --> 00:17:34,981
Two.

295
00:17:35,048 --> 00:17:37,782
And water. Please.

296
00:17:54,649 --> 00:17:57,849
You know I got to put
the gag back on.

297
00:17:57,916 --> 00:17:59,948
Wait, before you do,
I just have one more question.

298
00:18:00,015 --> 00:18:02,615
You seem like
a really good guy.

299
00:18:02,682 --> 00:18:05,348
Why are you doing this?

300
00:18:06,882 --> 00:18:08,948
(grunts softly)

301
00:18:09,015 --> 00:18:11,849
I'm not a good guy.

302
00:18:14,749 --> 00:18:17,749
...changes, do you really think
they'll help keep predators

303
00:18:17,816 --> 00:18:20,315
like Theodore Bagwell
safely <i>behind</i> bars?

304
00:18:21,232 --> 00:18:22,565
MAN:
...sure the authorities...

305
00:18:22,614 --> 00:18:25,047
Picture makes me look
like a sociopath.

306
00:18:27,114 --> 00:18:29,381
There's too much at stake
not to.

307
00:18:29,447 --> 00:18:31,481
I'm not joking with
you, trailer park.

308
00:18:31,547 --> 00:18:32,963
Now, get in here and dig!

309
00:18:32,964 --> 00:18:36,297
I am incapable,
thanks to all y'all.

310
00:18:36,364 --> 00:18:37,463
You just remember:

311
00:18:37,464 --> 00:18:39,536
my X marked the spot!

312
00:18:39,537 --> 00:18:40,659
You remember that.

313
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:42,621
We got a bigger issue.
The kid.

314
00:18:42,965 --> 00:18:44,398
How long's it been
since he left?

315
00:18:44,464 --> 00:18:46,731
An hour and a half, maybe.

316
00:18:46,798 --> 00:18:49,132
Hour and a half
to fill a tank of gas?

317
00:18:49,199 --> 00:18:51,631
they're right
There has been a breaking development
That ain't right.

318
00:18:51,698 --> 00:18:53,380
in the double homicide
prosecution

319
00:18:53,381 --> 00:18:54,882
of Lincoln Burrows Jr.

320
00:18:54,948 --> 00:18:58,149
Due to the sudden disappearance
of crucial blood and...

321
00:18:58,214 --> 00:19:00,448
Hey, Linc,
I didn't know you had a boy.

322
00:19:00,515 --> 00:19:02,782
...itself, the Cook County
District Attorney's Office

323
00:19:02,848 --> 00:19:05,080
had no choice but to drop

324
00:19:05,081 --> 00:19:08,342
all charges
against the 16-year-old.

325
00:19:08,615 --> 00:19:10,639
Burrows is scheduled
to be released

326
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,007
from the Klipton
Detention Center

327
00:19:12,074 --> 00:19:15,107
in Kingman, Arizona,
where he's currently being held,

328
00:19:15,174 --> 00:19:17,075
tomorrow morning.

329
00:19:22,241 --> 00:19:24,248
Keys to the car--
where are they?

330
00:19:24,249 --> 00:19:25,249
??

331
00:19:27,028 --> 00:19:29,399
You can't do this. Linc.
Watch.

332
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,899
We're five minutes
away in there.

333
00:19:30,966 --> 00:19:33,342
We've been five minutes
for four hours.

334
00:19:33,343 --> 00:19:35,710
Just give me some time.
Be patient.

335
00:19:35,777 --> 00:19:36,822
You think I give a damn
about the money?

336
00:19:36,823 --> 00:19:37,790
I'm doing
what's necessary!

337
00:19:37,857 --> 00:19:39,679
You're afraid to fail--
you're afraid

338
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,180
this big plan of yours
ain't gonna work out.

339
00:19:41,247 --> 00:19:42,647
You want to get caught
proving you can

340
00:19:42,714 --> 00:19:44,046
pull this thing off,
be my guest.

341
00:19:44,113 --> 00:19:46,380
LJ's out there;
I'm gonna get him.

342
00:19:46,447 --> 00:19:48,414
We have come 1,500 miles

343
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,647
across the country.

344
00:19:49,714 --> 00:19:50,913
We have made it

345
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:52,946
this far.

346
00:19:55,113 --> 00:19:58,547
Then I guess
this is where we part ways.

347
00:20:38,017 --> 00:20:39,628
MAN:
 <i>Any word of how</i>
 <i>the interrogation's going?</i>

348
00:20:39,629 --> 00:20:41,162
WHEELER:
 <i>Nah, the kid's</i>
 <i>still stonewalling,</i>

349
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:42,956
 <i>but we've got confirmation</i>

350
00:20:43,023 --> 00:20:46,390
on Patoshik;
his prints were all over
that old lady's house.

351
00:20:46,457 --> 00:20:48,905
So he leaves the cash
and the jewelry.

352
00:20:48,906 --> 00:20:52,272
The only thing he steals is
a ten-dollar oil painting.

353
00:20:52,273 --> 00:20:54,093
What the hell's
wrong with that?

354
00:21:11,673 --> 00:21:13,306
(dog barks)

355
00:21:16,506 --> 00:21:18,440
Is there something
I can help you with?

356
00:21:18,506 --> 00:21:19,540
(barking)

357
00:21:19,606 --> 00:21:22,107
What? No.
You know, it'd be

358
00:21:22,174 --> 00:21:24,706
a little easier if you use
the cart for all that stuff.

359
00:21:24,707 --> 00:21:28,985
I'm just, uh, I wanted to...
see if it'd all fit in the bag.

360
00:21:33,087 --> 00:21:34,306
What happened
to your knee there?

361
00:21:34,307 --> 00:21:36,173
Motorcycle accident.

362
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,373
(barking continues)
So, uh...

363
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,706
you don't move around too well,
then, do you?

364
00:21:40,149 --> 00:21:41,783
Not very.

365
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:43,382
That's good.
Hey! Hey!

366
00:21:43,449 --> 00:21:44,516
Hey! Hey!

367
00:22:04,994 --> 00:22:05,981
You can still come with me.

368
00:22:05,982 --> 00:22:08,015
No, I can...

369
00:22:09,916 --> 00:22:11,583
I can do this.

370
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:15,483
And if you can't?

371
00:22:15,549 --> 00:22:17,082
Then we still
meet up

372
00:22:17,083 --> 00:22:18,916
exactly where
we planned.
Bolshee Booze.

373
00:22:18,983 --> 00:22:20,216
Bolshoi.

374
00:22:20,283 --> 00:22:21,816
Bolshoi.

375
00:22:21,883 --> 00:22:24,297
LJ's going to be with me.

376
00:22:25,548 --> 00:22:27,084
You remember how
to get there?

377
00:22:27,085 --> 00:22:28,282
How can I forget?

378
00:22:28,283 --> 00:22:31,383
Thursday night,
6:00.

379
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:33,016
It's our last shot.

380
00:22:35,217 --> 00:22:36,849
If we're, uh...

381
00:22:36,916 --> 00:22:38,716
Um...

382
00:22:38,783 --> 00:22:40,684
If we do this right,

383
00:22:40,749 --> 00:22:42,483
we're gone forever.

384
00:22:44,285 --> 00:22:47,092
Lot of ground to cover
in three days.

385
00:22:47,093 --> 00:22:48,092
Lot of ground.

386
00:22:48,093 --> 00:22:49,792
Yeah.

387
00:22:49,859 --> 00:22:51,082
All right.

388
00:22:53,257 --> 00:22:54,357
Take care.

389
00:22:56,330 --> 00:22:57,730
They'll be
gunning for you.

390
00:22:59,014 --> 00:23:01,913
They'll get you
any way they can, so...

391
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:03,780
Yep.

392
00:23:04,676 --> 00:23:06,175
Tell LJ...

393
00:23:06,413 --> 00:23:08,978
tell him I said
there'll be a surfboard

394
00:23:08,979 --> 00:23:10,580
with his name on it.

395
00:23:10,647 --> 00:23:12,413
Nice.

396
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,346
Bolshoi Booze.

397
00:23:14,413 --> 00:23:15,547
BOTH:
Three days.

398
00:23:15,613 --> 00:23:16,680
Keep your head down.

399
00:23:18,914 --> 00:23:20,914
(engine starting)

400
00:23:48,613 --> 00:23:49,914
Ms. Tancredi...

401
00:23:51,854 --> 00:23:53,488
Hi. Um...

402
00:23:53,489 --> 00:23:55,461
I just wanted to let you know
that the ME--

403
00:23:55,462 --> 00:23:57,979
she's finished her preliminary
examination of the body.

404
00:23:58,787 --> 00:23:59,565
She found

405
00:23:59,566 --> 00:24:01,699
no signs of foul play.

406
00:24:04,299 --> 00:24:06,332
I know it's a shock,
but we've also spoken

407
00:24:06,399 --> 00:24:08,366
to the detail guard
stationed outside

408
00:24:08,433 --> 00:24:10,766
and he didn't see anyone
other than your father

409
00:24:10,833 --> 00:24:12,332
enter or exit
the mansion

410
00:24:12,399 --> 00:24:14,065
since he came back
from Washington.

411
00:24:14,132 --> 00:24:17,032
My father is not
a suicidal man.

412
00:24:20,533 --> 00:24:22,617
Look, is there
any extended family

413
00:24:22,618 --> 00:24:24,117
I should call?

414
00:24:24,118 --> 00:24:26,852
I'm an only child.
My mother passed away.

415
00:24:29,092 --> 00:24:30,458
Could I have
a moment, please?

416
00:24:30,459 --> 00:24:31,758
Yeah.

417
00:25:04,718 --> 00:25:06,584
That's a hell
of a good deal, son.

418
00:25:07,367 --> 00:25:09,661
I mean, we're talking
no additional time
on your sentence

419
00:25:09,662 --> 00:25:10,211
for the escape.

420
00:25:10,212 --> 00:25:11,945
You want it in writing,
I'll put it in writing.

421
00:25:13,389 --> 00:25:15,607
We will put you up
at Club Fed

422
00:25:15,608 --> 00:25:17,758
and you'll spend your days
playing racquetball

423
00:25:17,759 --> 00:25:19,525
with stockbrokers and lawyers.

424
00:25:21,592 --> 00:25:23,757
Four years from now
you'll be out on the street,

425
00:25:23,758 --> 00:25:25,758
22 years old
with a clean slate

426
00:25:27,048 --> 00:25:28,791
and your whole life
ahead of you,

427
00:25:30,784 --> 00:25:33,517
and no blood
on your hands.

428
00:25:33,874 --> 00:25:35,844
Okay?

429
00:25:39,058 --> 00:25:40,826
There's a woman in the house.

430
00:25:44,926 --> 00:25:47,892
If you guys show up...

431
00:25:49,792 --> 00:25:52,380
it's just going to turn her
into a hostage.

432
00:25:54,125 --> 00:25:55,882
T-Bag--

433
00:25:56,883 --> 00:25:58,283
he ain't coming out alive.

434
00:25:58,350 --> 00:26:00,350
And he's going to take her
with him.

435
00:26:00,417 --> 00:26:01,983
Let me worry about that.

436
00:26:02,050 --> 00:26:04,783
Uh-uh. No, hell, no.

437
00:26:06,412 --> 00:26:08,467
The only way that
that woman

438
00:26:08,468 --> 00:26:11,801
comes out free is if someone
shows up on that porch

439
00:26:11,868 --> 00:26:14,450
that they trust.

440
00:26:14,451 --> 00:26:15,718
Being you?

441
00:26:18,651 --> 00:26:20,718
Being me.

442
00:26:29,228 --> 00:26:30,728
??

443
00:27:34,207 --> 00:27:36,240
You like it?

444
00:27:36,307 --> 00:27:38,374
You like jerk...
you like jerky?

445
00:27:39,941 --> 00:27:42,674
You like jerky.

446
00:27:48,207 --> 00:27:50,340
What were you in for?

447
00:27:52,374 --> 00:27:53,807
I don't want to talk, lady.

448
00:27:53,874 --> 00:27:56,440
I'm a prisoner in my own house.

449
00:27:56,441 --> 00:27:57,439
Least you could
offer me

450
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,237
is a little conversation.

451
00:28:01,007 --> 00:28:03,341
All right.

452
00:28:03,408 --> 00:28:05,774
Just let me know
when I hit it.

453
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,241
Murder?

454
00:28:07,308 --> 00:28:09,374
Rape? Kidnapping?

455
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,740
Sexual abuse?

456
00:28:10,807 --> 00:28:12,987
Child sexual abuse?

457
00:28:12,988 --> 00:28:14,854
Aggravated robbery.

458
00:28:16,596 --> 00:28:18,665
How long were you doing?

459
00:28:18,666 --> 00:28:20,067
Five years.

460
00:28:20,133 --> 00:28:22,367
How much longer did you
have left to serve?

461
00:28:22,434 --> 00:28:24,083
18 months.

462
00:28:24,084 --> 00:28:24,915
Why on earth would you

463
00:28:24,916 --> 00:28:26,684
break out of prison with...?

464
00:28:31,816 --> 00:28:33,483
What's her name?

465
00:28:35,617 --> 00:28:37,274
It doesn't matter.

466
00:28:37,275 --> 00:28:39,942
So what, she was running away
with another man?

467
00:28:43,391 --> 00:28:44,957
Look, maybe you should have let
her go rather instead of...

468
00:28:44,958 --> 00:28:46,292
She's having my baby.

469
00:28:48,541 --> 00:28:49,541
How far along is she?

470
00:28:49,608 --> 00:28:51,708
I don't want to talk about it.

471
00:28:51,775 --> 00:28:53,641
I'm two months.
I just had my first trimester

472
00:28:53,708 --> 00:28:55,775
sonogram on Tuesday.

473
00:28:55,842 --> 00:28:57,408
MAN:
10-5 Dispatch to all units.

474
00:28:57,474 --> 00:28:58,741
Has she shown you
pictures of...?

475
00:28:59,255 --> 00:29:00,055
Shh!

476
00:29:00,056 --> 00:29:02,355
Transporting David Apolskis
in FBI custody. Stand by.

477
00:29:12,088 --> 00:29:13,790
Yo, this is going
to take all day.

478
00:29:13,791 --> 00:29:15,057
We need more manpower.

479
00:29:15,124 --> 00:29:17,056
You know, standing around
jabbering ain't gonna

480
00:29:17,057 --> 00:29:17,804
get the dirt

481
00:29:17,805 --> 00:29:18,524
out of that ground.

482
00:29:19,094 --> 00:29:20,317
??all right,that is it

483
00:29:21,495 --> 00:29:22,495
??

484
00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:23,504
??now what

485
00:29:27,659 --> 00:29:29,155
We got to roll.

486
00:29:29,234 --> 00:29:29,868
Why?

487
00:29:29,869 --> 00:29:31,536
They got Tweener.
It was on the radio.

488
00:29:35,636 --> 00:29:36,919
Nice knowing y'all.

489
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,253
They say anything
about where we are?

490
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:40,020
I'm not hanging around
to find out.

491
00:29:44,636 --> 00:29:46,503
Well, maybe you should.

492
00:29:57,939 --> 00:29:59,772
Maybe you should.

493
00:30:06,439 --> 00:30:09,205
Maybe we all should.

494
00:30:28,194 --> 00:30:29,160
Let's go over
this again.

495
00:30:29,161 --> 00:30:30,295
None of them are armed?

496
00:30:30,361 --> 00:30:31,961
With guns-- no.

497
00:30:32,028 --> 00:30:34,827
Bagwell had a screwdriver
or something.

498
00:30:36,327 --> 00:30:37,494
Do we really need this, man?

499
00:30:37,495 --> 00:30:38,894
Yeah.

500
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:41,047
In case you decide
to do something

501
00:30:41,114 --> 00:30:43,247
stupid like tip them off.

502
00:30:43,423 --> 00:30:46,091
you get to the ocean.

503
00:30:48,423 --> 00:30:49,924
Holland.

504
00:30:55,256 --> 00:30:57,457
I'm going to live
in a windmill.

505
00:30:58,612 --> 00:31:00,634
All we need is a raft.

506
00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:04,290
I'm going to build it.

507
00:31:04,757 --> 00:31:07,256
It all starts with this...

508
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:10,550
no, this stick.

509
00:31:16,057 --> 00:31:21,124
Charles Westmoreland, God bless
you and your wrinkled old sack.

510
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:24,124
It's all here.

511
00:31:24,191 --> 00:31:26,462
I owe you a profound thanks,
pretty.

512
00:31:28,152 --> 00:31:29,607
A couple days from now,

513
00:31:29,607 --> 00:31:31,257
I'm going to be walking down
the streets of Bangkok

514
00:31:31,258 --> 00:31:32,857
with a million US
in my pocket.

515
00:31:32,858 --> 00:31:35,258
That's about 40 million baht
in the local currency.

516
00:31:35,325 --> 00:31:37,924
Man, what the hell is up
with you and Thailand, huh?

517
00:31:37,991 --> 00:31:42,291
Black market surgery,
anonymous transplant donors,

518
00:31:42,357 --> 00:31:45,158
"he"s dressed like "she"s--
what's there not to like?

519
00:31:45,225 --> 00:31:48,390
Are you really going to try
to replace that hand?

520
00:31:48,457 --> 00:31:50,691
Body ain't takin' to this one.

521
00:31:56,170 --> 00:31:57,433
Unbelievable.

522
00:31:57,434 --> 00:31:58,733
All right, let's move.

523
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:01,800
You know, that hand
ain't gonna be white.

524
00:32:01,867 --> 00:32:03,134
What?

525
00:32:03,201 --> 00:32:04,534
The new one.

526
00:32:04,633 --> 00:32:06,534
Even if you get down there,
it ain't gonna be white.

527
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,468
(engine revving)

528
00:32:08,534 --> 00:32:11,900
Hey, Johnny KKK over here
is going to have an Asian hand.

529
00:32:28,934 --> 00:32:31,834
No mistakes.
Let's get them clean.

530
00:32:40,301 --> 00:32:41,916
I need to know if

531
00:32:41,917 --> 00:32:43,650
 <i>I can trust him.</i>

532
00:32:43,651 --> 00:32:44,901
??

533
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:50,426
Now walk.

534
00:33:35,926 --> 00:33:38,059
Scott...
I don't got
much time, all right.

535
00:33:38,126 --> 00:33:39,259
I had to tell you something.
Son of a...

536
00:33:41,059 --> 00:33:43,159
What you did for me
that day at the motel...

537
00:33:45,326 --> 00:33:47,526
...ain't nobody in my life has
been to bat for me like that.

538
00:33:50,092 --> 00:33:51,359
And I lied to you.

539
00:33:53,159 --> 00:33:54,926
Hands on your head.
Get on your knees!
My name isn't Scott.

540
00:33:55,381 --> 00:33:57,581
On your knees now!
My name is Dave.

541
00:33:57,582 --> 00:33:58,615
Dave Apolskis.
Get down!

542
00:34:03,048 --> 00:34:04,248
And I just...

543
00:34:07,415 --> 00:34:08,615
I wanted you to know.

544
00:34:08,681 --> 00:34:10,148
Because I'm gonna be
writing you.

545
00:34:10,215 --> 00:34:13,549
And I sure as hell hope
that you write back.

546
00:34:33,182 --> 00:34:34,781
MICHAEL:
 <i>Can I help you?</i>

547
00:34:34,848 --> 00:34:37,615
I'm sorry.
Do I know you?

548
00:34:37,681 --> 00:34:38,981
Contractor.

549
00:34:39,048 --> 00:34:41,382
We got some
electrical issues.

550
00:34:41,448 --> 00:34:44,048
No. No, you can't help me.

551
00:34:44,115 --> 00:34:45,382
Excuse me.
Is there a problem?

552
00:34:46,515 --> 00:34:48,714
Ms. Owens is not home.

553
00:34:48,781 --> 00:34:51,848
Yeah, well, I'm supposed
to drive her to the club...

554
00:34:51,915 --> 00:34:53,015
She already went
to the club.

555
00:34:53,081 --> 00:34:56,382
Yeah, um, she came out,
said she was

556
00:34:56,448 --> 00:34:57,615
going to the club.

557
00:34:57,681 --> 00:34:58,981
She got into her car
and left.

558
00:35:01,015 --> 00:35:02,781
I don't know what else
to tell you.

559
00:35:05,115 --> 00:35:06,915
Yeah. Okay, thanks.

560
00:35:26,681 --> 00:35:27,981
He's gone.

561
00:35:28,048 --> 00:35:29,415
We got to get out of here.

562
00:35:29,482 --> 00:35:30,948
'Cause once he gets to the club,

563
00:35:31,015 --> 00:35:32,248
he's going to find out
she's not there.

564
00:35:32,315 --> 00:35:33,382
Then he's going to be back.

565
00:35:39,182 --> 00:35:40,848
Know what?

566
00:35:40,915 --> 00:35:42,115
You were right.

567
00:35:42,182 --> 00:35:43,830
It does feel good to get stuff

568
00:35:43,831 --> 00:35:44,932
off your chest.

569
00:35:45,998 --> 00:35:46,965
I'm sorry I had to

570
00:35:47,032 --> 00:35:48,032
play you like that, bro.

571
00:35:57,265 --> 00:35:58,464
Yo, what's up?

572
00:36:01,831 --> 00:36:03,731
Come on.
It's going to be a long drive.

573
00:36:03,798 --> 00:36:05,165
Stretch your legs.

574
00:36:27,432 --> 00:36:28,864
All right.

575
00:36:44,298 --> 00:36:45,665
 <i>Kellerman.</i>

576
00:36:45,732 --> 00:36:48,398
I thought you were going to deal
with the LJ Burrows situation.

577
00:36:48,465 --> 00:36:50,098
Oh, I did.

578
00:36:50,165 --> 00:36:52,799
Then why is he being released
from custody tomorrow?

579
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:54,699
In and of himself, the kid

580
00:36:54,765 --> 00:36:55,998
is useless to us.

581
00:36:56,065 --> 00:37:00,298
His only value lies in
who comes looking for him.

582
00:37:00,365 --> 00:37:01,732
More importantly, though,

583
00:37:01,799 --> 00:37:03,298
Governor Tancredi...

584
00:37:03,365 --> 00:37:05,098
not part of our plan.

585
00:37:05,165 --> 00:37:08,663
Last time I checked, you left no
shortage of bodies in your wake.

586
00:37:08,664 --> 00:37:11,931
No, I did what I had to do
to get Caroline where she is.

587
00:37:11,998 --> 00:37:13,165
Now that she's there,

588
00:37:13,232 --> 00:37:15,332
let's not draw any more
attention than we have to.

589
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:17,898
You think getting to the top
is the hard part?

590
00:37:17,965 --> 00:37:19,898
She's a hundred times
more visible,

591
00:37:19,965 --> 00:37:21,499
has a hundred times
more enemies.

592
00:37:21,564 --> 00:37:23,765
Anyone who knows anything
has got to be dealt with.

593
00:37:23,831 --> 00:37:26,865
If someone is a liability,
they go.

594
00:37:26,931 --> 00:37:31,365
Tancredi was becoming
a liability.

595
00:37:31,432 --> 00:37:33,432
So was his daughter.

596
00:37:33,499 --> 00:37:35,499
Wait. What?

597
00:37:35,564 --> 00:37:37,298
Sara?

598
00:37:39,831 --> 00:37:40,965
I'll be in touch.

599
00:38:26,432 --> 00:38:28,432
You walk out that door
with those guys right now,

600
00:38:28,499 --> 00:38:30,564
and it's only a matter of time
before you get caught.

601
00:38:30,565 --> 00:38:31,498
You realize that,
don't you?

602
00:38:31,565 --> 00:38:32,698
You're not just gonna be
dealing with

603
00:38:32,765 --> 00:38:34,415
escape charges,
but assault,

604
00:38:34,416 --> 00:38:35,649
unlawful imprisonment,

605
00:38:35,716 --> 00:38:37,382
kidnapping...
I don't need
to hear this right now.

606
00:38:37,449 --> 00:38:38,265
Oh, no, you do.

607
00:38:38,266 --> 00:38:39,199
How much longer
do you really think

608
00:38:39,266 --> 00:38:41,565
you can stay ahead
of the cops?

609
00:38:44,504 --> 00:38:45,965
Look, if you turn yourself in,

610
00:38:45,966 --> 00:38:48,257
I will testify
at the sentencing.

611
00:38:48,257 --> 00:38:49,390
I will say that
you cooperated.

612
00:38:49,457 --> 00:38:50,524
That can make
a huge difference.

613
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:51,657
Shut up.

614
00:38:51,724 --> 00:38:52,856
Be smart.

615
00:38:52,923 --> 00:38:54,090
You have a baby on the way.

616
00:38:54,157 --> 00:38:56,923
Do you want to be around
for its second birthday

617
00:38:56,990 --> 00:38:58,257
or its 22nd?
Shut up.

618
00:38:58,324 --> 00:38:59,256
If you didn't want to
hear what I had to say,

619
00:38:59,257 --> 00:39:01,023
if you didn't want to hear what
a big mistake you're making,

620
00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:02,956
you would've put
that gag back on me...
(yells)

621
00:39:08,618 --> 00:39:10,230
MICHAEL:
Fernando!

622
00:39:10,231 --> 00:39:11,832
Time to get out
of here. Let's go.

623
00:39:13,031 --> 00:39:15,532
You can still do
the right thing, Fernando.

624
00:39:20,765 --> 00:39:23,231
Look-a-here,
look-a-here.

625
00:39:23,298 --> 00:39:25,498
Look-a-here.

626
00:39:25,565 --> 00:39:26,598
Pocket change.

627
00:39:26,665 --> 00:39:28,264
In case you want
to tip the valet

628
00:39:28,265 --> 00:39:29,531
when you're at the Ritz.

629
00:39:29,598 --> 00:39:31,032
Yeah, that's what
I'm talking about, boy.

630
00:39:31,098 --> 00:39:32,232
Where's Sucre?

631
00:39:33,365 --> 00:39:35,965
Right here.

632
00:39:36,032 --> 00:39:37,065
What are you doing?

633
00:39:37,132 --> 00:39:39,432
Drop the bag.

634
00:39:39,499 --> 00:39:41,998
No one's going anywhere.

635
00:39:58,731 --> 00:39:59,765
Hey, yo.

636
00:39:59,831 --> 00:40:02,465
Just so you know, man, I'm not

637
00:40:02,531 --> 00:40:04,365
gonna roll on those guys.

638
00:40:04,432 --> 00:40:06,065
It ain't gonna happen, so...

639
00:40:06,132 --> 00:40:08,198
if that's what this is about...

640
00:40:11,865 --> 00:40:14,032
We were talking about

641
00:40:14,098 --> 00:40:15,865
confession earlier.

642
00:40:17,998 --> 00:40:20,598
And, uh...

643
00:40:21,664 --> 00:40:23,931
I think I owe you
an apology

644
00:40:23,998 --> 00:40:25,765
because I lied to you...

645
00:40:27,165 --> 00:40:29,499
...about Oscar Shales.

646
00:40:33,465 --> 00:40:37,499
Smart-ass just kept pushing it,
and I...

647
00:40:37,564 --> 00:40:39,664
I snapped.

648
00:40:41,232 --> 00:40:42,232
Right there.

649
00:40:44,265 --> 00:40:46,298
That's where I put
the bullet in him.

650
00:40:52,564 --> 00:40:55,531
I don't care about none of this.

651
00:40:55,598 --> 00:40:59,365
Mistake about that is forensics
will tell the whole tale.

652
00:40:59,432 --> 00:41:01,465
Powder burns.

653
00:41:01,531 --> 00:41:03,898
The gun was right
against his head.

654
00:41:06,531 --> 00:41:08,332
Sir...

655
00:41:08,399 --> 00:41:10,065
I think we should go back to...

656
00:41:10,132 --> 00:41:11,598
See, that's what's good
about confession, you know,

657
00:41:11,664 --> 00:41:14,931
'cause you say something,
you get it off your chest and...

658
00:41:14,998 --> 00:41:16,865
it just goes out there
into the whole world.

659
00:41:16,931 --> 00:41:17,998
And I'm so sorry about this,
kid,

660
00:41:18,065 --> 00:41:19,365
because I really hope
you understand.

661
00:41:19,432 --> 00:41:20,564
Yo, yo...

662
00:41:20,631 --> 00:41:22,265
I got nothing against you, kid.

663
00:41:24,598 --> 00:41:25,698
What are you doing, man?

664
00:41:25,765 --> 00:41:27,332
But they do.

665
00:42:16,865 --> 00:42:20,831
