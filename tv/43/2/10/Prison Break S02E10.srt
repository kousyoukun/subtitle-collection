00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:36,070
我都不确定你会不会来
I wasn't sure you'd come.

153
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:41,580
我没得选择
I didn't have a choice.

154
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:44,100
我知道这对你来说不容易
This isn't going to be easy for you

155
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:46,300
你的留言说
You said in your message

156
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:47,970
你有计划可以解决好这一切
that you had a plan to make this right.

157
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:51,110
我想知道是什么计划

你的传真机有记录吗?
Does the fax have memory?

169
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:27,740
应该有

00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,070

173
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:38,630
有什么要我做的吗?

174
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:41,670
她不会回来了
She isn't coming back.

175
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:45,200
我已经安排好一起去巴拿马了

176
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:47,470
明天我们就去和我哥哥会合

177
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:52,310
等下  这就是你的计划?

和两个美国头号通缉犯一起?

180
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:03,730
迈克尔  我来是因为
Michael, I came here because

181
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:05,370
我以为你会给我些象样的答案
I thought you were going to have real answers for me.

182
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:08,510
这就是答案
This is an answer.

183
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:11,200
这也是我们目前唯一的答案
And, right now, it's the only one we've got.

184
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:16,830
和一个欺骗过我的人一起亡命天涯?
Running away into the sunset with the man who lied to me?

185
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,300
是吗?
Really?

186
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:20,630
我是说你想过其他人吗?
I mean, did you know about the other guys?

187
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,570
你想过会把帝博格这种人

188
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:24,230
放回到大街上吗?
back out on to the street?

189
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,800
我从来也没想过会那样
I never meant for that to happen.

190
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:29,130
我在做一些不得不做的事
I was doing what I needed to do.

191
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:30,770
不然我哥哥就会死
My brother was going to die

192
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:34,140
可我父亲已经死了
Well, my father's dead

193
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:51,040
你父亲的事我很抱歉

对于你的那些事

196
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:01,200
我有很多很多的悔恨
I have many, many regrets

197
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:02,870
但那是最后悔的一个
but that's the biggest.

198
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:06,580
这已经于事无补了
it does not help me right now

199
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:14,180
这点我也很抱歉
I'm sorry for that, too.

200
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:17,900
我并不指望你...
I didn't expect you to, uh...

201
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:20,870
我并不指望你能原谅我

202

但是我不想让你...

不想让你独自来面对这一切

我不想独自面对

我们出不去了
You can't get out this way.

207
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:56,970
迈克尔 这是唯一一条出去的路
Go back is the only way out of here

208
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:59,680
我们就从这条路离开这里
That is where we are going.

209
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,870
坐稳了

太远了

如果我们不在他叫人来之前离开的话...

他不会找人支援的

238
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:42,700

00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:08,710
因为他我才被陷害的
He was the reason I was set up in the first place.

243
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,480
他以前为那些想我死的人工作

244
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:15,150
这些事情都是因为他

245
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:19,520
你父亲应该马上就到了

246
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:22,590

247
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:25,280

00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:30,920
你了解我爸吗?

250
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:32,880
了解很多?

我们以前共事过

00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:39,610
在公司里
Ah, the company.

00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:41,450
对
Yeah.

255
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:43,010
但那是很早前的事了
But that was a long time ago.

256
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:45,680
现在我跟公司对着干  他也一样
And now I work against them, just like he does.

257
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:47,850
那我猜你也抛弃你的家庭了
So I guess you walked out on your family, too.

258
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:49,410
没解释  没道别
No explanations, no good-byes.

259
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:51,180
我没有家庭
I don't have a family.

260
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:54,010
林肯  他真的想见你和你弟弟
I don't have a family.

261
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:56,280
迈克尔10岁以后你爸爸就再没见过他了
He hasn't seen Michael since he was ten years old.

262
00:23:56,290 --> 00:23:58,380
他们来了
They're here.

263
00:23:58,390 --> 00:24:01,720
在这等下
Wait here.

264
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,480
我们去哪里?
Where are we going?

265
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:13,710
迈克尔从来没见过你爷爷
Michael never met your grandfather.

266
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:16,460
嗨
Hey

267
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:26,050

我不想被困在这里
I don't want to get trapped in here.

269
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:31,250
另外那头肯定有个出口
There's got to be an exit on the other side.

270
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:35,480
你继续走
You go on. Michael.

271
00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:38,920
迈克儿  我会跟上你的  去吧

272
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,780
有坏消息了
the news is not good.

273
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:54,750
在我来之前  林肯・布伦斯被截走了
Burrows was intercepted before I got here.

274
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:57,680
是有点挫折  但我们没被甩开太远
It is a setback, but we're not that far behind.

275
00:25:57,690 --> 00:25:59,950
保罗 保罗 冷静 保罗  冷静
Paul, Paul, calm down.

276
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:02,150
没事了  会有人处理的
It'll be all right. Someone will take care of it.

277
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,710
有人  谁?
Someone... who?

278
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,510
比尔  别告诉我你--
ill, tell me you're not bringing someone else in on this.

279
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:07,810
--又找人介入了

280
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:09,880
你不会以为你是单枪匹马吧?
You didn't think you were alone on this, did you?

281
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:12,780
你只是个士兵
You're a soldier.

282
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:14,750
我们是支军队
There's an army.

283
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:17,980
你从莎拉那得到了什么消息?
Tell me, what do you have on Sara Tancredi?

284
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:19,810
这两件事有联系吗?
What does that have to do with this?

285
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:21,610
去完成你最初的工作
Go back to your original assignment.

286
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:24,050
比尔  这里有我  我能搞定  然后
Bill, I'm here now. I can do this,

287
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:25,380
那女的
and then... the girl.

288
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:28,350
我们要知道她父亲跟她说了什么
We need to know what her father told her.

289
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:33,320
你查清楚了  打我电话
When you find out, give me a call.

给我查查莎拉的租车信息

全景驾驶舱
flybridge, panoramics

295
00:28:33,890 --> 00:28:35,910
有了这么一艘船  你就是个人物了
you pull up in a boat like that, you're somebody.

296
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:38,960
-让我看看 -别碰
- Let me see. - Get off.

297
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:52,420
感觉如何啊?
how ya doin', Bagwell?

298
00:28:54,690 --> 00:28:56,110
去拿屎
Get the stool.

299
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,680
什么?
- What stool?

300
00:28:57,690 --> 00:29:01,220
去拿他的大便
- The stool.

301
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:10,310
这是开某个汽车站储物柜的
It's from one of them lockers in a bus station.

302
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:14,690
我会尽量不去想这玩意之前到过哪
I'll try not to think about where it's been.

303
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,720
不不不  别这样  求你挂掉吧
no, no, no, no-- don't do that, now. Come on.

304
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:26,890
你好  请派个警察来
Hey, there. Send the police.

305
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:29,320
一个疯子闯进我家里来了
Some scumbag broke into my house.

306
00:29:29,330 --> 00:29:30,960
对  马贝里山1505号 对 505 马泊里山庄
Yeah, 1505 Marberry Hill.

307
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:32,420
他还在吗?
- Is he still there?

308
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:35,100
在  你们最好快点
- Yeah, you better come quick.

309
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:37,120
上路吧  罗伊
let's hit it, roy.

310
00:29:37,130 --> 00:29:38,360
求你了  别这样
Come on, now, please don't do this.

311
00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:40,420
别  别把我就这么扔下好吗?
Don't-- just don't leave me like this, okay?

00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:41,960
我可以带你们去拿钱  我知道在什么地方
I can take you right to the money, I know right where it is.

313
00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:43,790
我也知道  再见
So do I. Adios.

314
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:47,030
求你了  别这样
I'm begging you, don't do this. Please!

315
00:29:47,570 --> 00:29:49,220
求你了  咱们商量商量
Geary, come on, we can make a deal, man. Come on, come on.

316
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:50,520
-求你了 -没的商量
No deals.

317
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:54,190
你已经输掉最后一块筹码了  老弟
You just crapped out your last bargaining chip, pal.

318
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:57,770
拜托!
Please!

319
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:45,050
我要是你可不会这么做  亚历克斯
I wouldn't do that if I were you, Alex.

320
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:47,790
闻到了吗?
You smell that?

321
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,420
丙烷
It's propane.

322
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:51,490
到处都是
It's filling the room.

323
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:53,950
你一扣扳机
And if you pull that trigger,

324
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:57,500
我们都会死
we both die.

325
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:13,050
我会开枪的!
I'll do it!

326
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:14,390
我会开枪的!
I'll do it!

327
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:17,050
可能吧
Maybe.

328
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:20,790
在那之前  我问你个问题
But before you do, let me ask you a question, Alex.

329
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:23,790
你认为你还算是个好人
Do you think you're still one of the good guys

330
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,720
在为正义而战吗?
fighting the good fight?

331
00:31:25,730 --> 00:31:27,550
因为我想我们都明白你已经越线了
Because I think we both know you've crossed over.

332
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:30,890
你在错误的立场上追逐着错误的对象
You're on the wrong, side chasing the wrong guys.

333
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:32,990
我哥是无辜的
My brother is innocent.

334
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,390
他根本没杀过人
He never killed anyone.

335
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:39,160
多谢你让我看清这一切
Oh, thanks for opening my eyes.

336
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:41,520
行了 亚历克斯  开枪
Okay, Alex, shoot.

337
00:31:41,530 --> 00:31:42,990
我们都知道接下来的事
We both know what will happen.

338
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,290
丙烷早晚会把我熏死  我开不开枪
The propane will kill me anyway,

339
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:46,920
又有什么差别  我到觉得现在正是时候
what difference does it make? Might as well do it right now.

340
00:31:46,930 --> 00:31:49,660
言之有理
That's a good point.

341
00:31:53,730 --> 00:31:55,150
好了吧
there. There!

342
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:57,490
这样就会给你点时间
That'll give you some time

343
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:58,950
来思考下你正在做的事
to think about what you're doing.

344
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,650
但首先给你句忠告  收手吧
But first, a word of advice: Stop.

345
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:04,290
因为你追得再近
Because when you get close,

346
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:08,330
到最后都是我赢
I will win every time.

347
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:12,390
你真这么想?
You think?

348
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,590
在笼子里的不是我
- I'm not the one in the cage.

349
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,190
对  不是你
- No, you're not.

350
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:19,350
你我之间有个很大的区别  迈克尔
There's one big difference between you and I, Michael.

351
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:22,420
你也刚证明了这点
And you just proved it.

352
00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:24,420
你不杀人
You can't kill.

353
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:26,850
而只有杀了我才能阻止我
And that's what it's gonna take to stop me.

354
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:29,390
因为我不会象你这样有所保留
'Cause I don't have the same reservations.

355
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:32,450
我也不能那样
I can't.

356
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:34,450
所以要么就是现在在吉拉
So whether it's today in Gila

357
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:37,090
或者是明日在阿儿布克亦或是2月后...
or tomorrow in Albuquerque or two months from now...

358
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:40,220
在巴拿马
in Panama.

359
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:43,860
我会抓到你的
I will get you.

360
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:50,130
我没的选择
I don't have a choice.

361
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:15,150
我争取了点时间
I bought us some time.

362
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,050
你还好吗?  在流血呢
You okay? You're bleeding.

363
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:19,090
没事  我们走吧
Yeah, let's go.

364
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:21,800
系上安全带
Your seatbelt.

365
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:41,090
这儿  804
Here.

366
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:44,160
让开
Move.

367
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:05,320
这恐怕是你见过的最美的东西了吧?
Ain't that the most beautiful thing you ever seen?

368
00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:07,320
全是钞票
All that green.

369
00:34:07,330 --> 00:34:10,120
这比大峡谷还壮观
It's prettier than the grand canyon.

370
00:34:10,130 --> 00:34:12,350
罗伊  这是历史性的一刻
You know, Roy, this is a monumental moment

371
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,350
对我们两个来说
for both

372
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,420
把包给我  贝利克
Hand over the bag, Bellick.

373
00:34:14,430 --> 00:34:16,620
把锤子放下  老太太
Put down the pounder, grandma.

374
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:18,050
我不是在开玩笑
Hey, hey. I am not kidding around.

375
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:21,130
你以为就凭你那软骨头...?
Well, you think your pansy ass...

376
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:37,830
下次你去屎堆里掏吧
Next time, you pick through the crap.

377
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:08,190
好了 急救箱
Okay, first-aid kit

378
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:10,090
可丢弃的电话和几支牙刷
disposable phones, couple of toothbrushes.

379
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:11,990
旅店怎么样了?
What about the motel?

380
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:17,360
他们是按小时记费的不需要证件
They charge by the hour, so they didn't ask for id.

381
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,490
你拿着钥匙吗?
- Do you have the keys?

382
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:26,160
是的
- Yeah.

383
00:35:45,130 --> 00:35:46,150
抱歉我们不在家
Sorry, we're not home.

384
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,420
在听到提示音后请留言
Leave a message at the beep

385
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:48,490
我们会给你回电
and we'll get back to you.

386
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:50,890
这个留言是给玛丽克鲁滋的
Listen. This message is for Maricruz.

387
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:54,090
我就在那里等你的电话
I was right there waiting for your call,

388
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:56,620
但是有警察来了我不能接电话
but the cops showed up and I couldn't pick up the phone.

389
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:58,750
我想这大概就是
I know probably that's the exact reason

390
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:01,590
你不想和我在一起的原因
why you may not want to be with me.

391
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,650
听我说
Listen to me.

392
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:07,190
我的姑姑达丽斯就住在墨西哥城外
My aunt Ldalyz, she lives outside Mexico city,

393
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,590
在山里面的一个农场里
in the mountains, on a farm,

394
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:12,990
有能让小孩骑的南美驼

395
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,220
在下周
So, next week,

396
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:17,150
等你回家的时候
when you fly back home,

397
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:18,620
当你到机场的时候
when you go to the airport,

398
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:21,850
我会到机场去接你
I'll be there.

399
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:23,790
我会在伊克斯塔帕等你
n the airport. In Ixtapa I'll wait for you.

400
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:27,450
我向你保证  玛丽

401
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:29,620
我爱你玛丽  爱你超过一切
I love you, Mari.I love you more than anything

402
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:31,150
我不能没有你
and I can't live without you.

403
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:33,920
我知道的
I just know

404
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:37,160
我会想办法的  宝贝
I can make it work, baby.

405
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:41,550
这是给你路上用的 万一有什么麻烦用的上
This is, uh, in case you run into trouble down the road.

406
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:49,360
我有办法
I have a way.

407
00:36:49,530 --> 00:36:50,890
她在哪儿?
- Where is she?

408
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:52,320
-谁? -玛丽克鲁滋
- Who? Maricruz.

409
00:36:52,330 --> 00:36:53,950
她不在家也没去上班
She wasn't home and she's not at work.

410
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,690
她也不在这儿
Well, she's not here.

411
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:56,620
我不知道她在哪儿
I don't know where she is.

412
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:57,820
你想找麻烦吗  卡琳达?
You want problems, Kalinda?

413
00:36:57,830 --> 00:37:00,460
别骗我
Don't lie to me.

414
00:37:06,330 --> 00:37:09,890
她去墨西哥了  是不是?
She went to Mexico, didn't she?

415
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:13,630
去度我们的蜜月
And on our honeymoon.

416
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:17,160
还是我掏的钱
Paid for with my money.

417
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,120
可能会有些疼
This isn't gonna feel good.

418
00:37:22,130 --> 00:37:25,090
我抗疼痛能力很高
I have a high tolerance for pain.

419
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:26,220
这你知道的
You know that.

420
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:29,000
是的
You do.

421
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:32,500
你也不是什么糖尿病人  是吧?
And you're not a diabetic, are you?

422
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:39,000
好吧
All right.

423
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:49,200
迈克尔  告诉我
Michael, tell me something.

424
00:37:50,430 --> 00:37:52,620
你是不是觉得某种程度上你也很享受这些?
You think there's a part of you that enjoys this?

425
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:54,420
伤口上的双氧水?

426
00:37:54,430 --> 00:37:55,690
不是
Peroxide in an open wound? No.

427
00:37:55,700 --> 00:38:00,450
我是说整个越狱以及逃亡
I mean escaping from prison nd being on the run

428
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:02,190
这些危险和恐惧
and the danger and the fear

429
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:04,220
紧迫感等等这所有的一切
and the rush, all that.

430
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:06,900
这个...
It, uh...

431
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:08,950
这对我来说就好象...
it feels to me like...

432
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:12,200
有吸毒一样的快感
chasing a high.

433
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:13,720
还有...
And...

434
00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:17,520
我知道这是什么感觉...
and I know what that's like and...

435
00:38:17,530 --> 00:38:21,700
我现在应该更明白了
I should know better by now.

436
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:26,930
我从来没从这方面想过
I never thought about it like that.

437
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:34,420
我知道我跟你说过这句话
I know you've heard this before

438
00:38:34,430 --> 00:38:37,050
但是不会一直这样下去的
but it won't always be like this.

439
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:39,720
从你跟我说的来看事情变得越来越糟
From everything you've told me, it's just getting worse.

440
00:38:39,730 --> 00:38:40,920
他们不可能永远追我们
They can't chase us forever.

441
00:38:40,930 --> 00:38:42,520
今天追我们这人
The guy who caught up with us today

442
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:44,650
他在边境就会停下
he stops at the border

443
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:46,320
所以我们必须要越境
and that's why we have to get across

444
00:38:46,330 --> 00:38:48,690
我安排了合适的人来帮我们
And I have the people in place to help us do that

445
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:52,400
明天我们就去见他们
We're meeting them tomorrow.

446
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:55,650
就再等一天  莎拉
One more day, Sara.

447
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:59,260
就一天
One more day.

448
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:03,500
我只要求那么多
That's all I'm asking.

449
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,190
你去清洗一下吧
You can go get cleaned up.

450
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:08,330
不要把这里弄湿了
Keep this dry.

451
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:25,960
莎拉
Sara.

452
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:30,000
我很高兴你来了
I'm glad you came.

453
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:42,510
那么...
So...

454
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:44,070
就是这位
- This is him.

455
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:47,470
小林肯
- Lincoln, Jr.

456
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:48,810
你照自己的名字给他起的？
- You named him after yourself.

457
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:52,450
我不会给他起名艾尔多的
- I wasn't gonna name him Aldo.

458
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:57,040
LJ这是你爷爷
LJ, this is your grandfather

459
00:39:57,050 --> 00:40:01,320
艾尔多 布伦斯
Aldo Burrows

460
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:09,250
我等这一刻已经很久了
Waited for this for a long time

461
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:18,850
我安排了一个安全的地方给你们去住
I've arranged a safe place for both of you to go to.

462
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:24,570
谢谢你把我们救出来但是  我们要去见迈克尔
I've arranged a safe place for both of you to go to.

463
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:26,270
他在哪儿?
Where is he?

464
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:30,310
在边境那儿一个叫波士瓦布丝的地方
Down by the border, a place called Bolshoi Booze.

465
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,510
我可以一个人去接他
- I can go alone and get him.

466
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:34,870
不行
- No.

467
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:37,970
情况变了
Things are different.

468
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:39,970
有些证据
There's some evidence.

469
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:41,910
我们只需要点时间
We just need a little more time

470
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:44,270
就能把整件事情公之于众...
and we can blow this whole thing wide open

471
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,540
但是没有时间了
but there is no time

472
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:47,940
我相信迈克尔 他有一个计划能  把我们都带到巴拿马去
I trust Michael he has a plan to get us to Panama

473
00:40:47,950 --> 00:40:49,940
你不明白
You don't understand.

474
00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:52,270
你们不需要去巴拿马
You don't need to go to Panama

475
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:56,620
不需要再逃亡了
You don't need to run anymore.

476
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:06,620
告诉我好消息吧
Tell me good news.

477
00:41:06,650 --> 00:41:10,070
巴伦斯们都在  共三个
I got Burrows-- the trifecta.

478
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:11,570
搞定他们
- Take care of them.

479
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:13,470
斯科菲尔德怎么办?  他们要去见他
- What about Scofield? They're gonna meet him.

480
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,510
没关系的
It doesn't matter.

481
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:18,480
快去干掉他们
Do it now.

482
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:57,280
莎拉?
Sara?

483
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:13,020
我已经学到教训， 对不起...
The fine I know better I am sorry...

484
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:16,220
你好啊  莎拉
