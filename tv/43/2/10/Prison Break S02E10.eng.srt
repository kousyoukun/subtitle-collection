Who is this?

6
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:13,920
I think you already know.

7
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:17,690
But if I buried someone in my own backyard,I'd think about it all the time.

8
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:22,350
Let me and my family disappear and in return,I'll keep your little secret.

9
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:24,260
I know it's not how you wanted this to play out.

10
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:27,300
Sometimes things happen that are just...out of your control.

11
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:28,600
I'll see you soon,michael.

12
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:30,710
It just may be sooner than you think.

13
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:31,680
You can't be here!

14
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:33,190
Where's your sister?I need to see maricruz.

16
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:38,180
Maricruz,she told him,"no." Can you believe that?

17
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:40,190
Go on,get your girl.

18
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:47,700

26
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:48,580
What is this?

27
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:54,040
it's for my blood pressure.

28
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,740
Looky what I found.

29
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,970
Guess ms.Hollander liked to beat some meat.

30
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:05,300
Maybe a couple of whacks in the temple with this will help you remember where you put the money.

31
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:08,890
Hey,we've been beating his ass all night.He ain't coming off the goods.

32
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:10,650
We need to do something different.

33
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:13,140
It don't matter what you do to me.

34
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,590
I ain't talking.

35
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:18,720
Well,I ain't stopping till I get what I came for.

36
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:21,230
not again.

37
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:29,920
now you're gonna tell me where that money is,or i'm gonna read it on your tombstone?

38
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,010
okay...

39
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:34,130
okay.

40
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:36,950
We'll give you a little clue.

41
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:41,360

He made it all the way to arizona.

46
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,180
Another day,he would have been gone.

47
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:14,890
You find mahone?

48
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:15,830
No.

49
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:18,830

59
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:41,560
Where's mr.Mahone?

60
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:44,910
I'm getting in touch with him right now,but I can take care of this one myself.

61
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:47,970
This is why we hired mr.Mahone.

62
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:50,180
He's the official face here.

63
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:53,780
Don't worry.This won't be official,and there won't be any questions.

64
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:55,510
Of course,there will.

65
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:59,530

A judge will decide that.

00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:22,140
You call ahead?
Yeah,phoenix is sending backup.

70

I didn't have a choice.

150
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:36,190
This isn't going to be easy for you.

151
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:40,060
You said in your message that you had a plan to make this right.

Yeah.He was trying to send her a fax.

00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:11,900
Did he do it?

161
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:13,740
Yeah.20 minutes ago.

162
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,450
Does the fax have memory?

163
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:17,280
I guess so.

164
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:23,910

Hey,if she comes ck,is there anything you want me to do?

167
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,620
She isn't coming back.

168
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,590
I've arranged for us to get to panama.

169
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:38,590
We're meeting up with my brother tomorrow.

170
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:42,380
Wait.That's your plan?

171
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:49,490
To run away to panama with the two most wanted men in america?

172
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,400
Michael,I came here because I thought you were going to have real answers for me.

173
00:15:56,430 --> 00:15:58,950
This is an answer.

174
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:03,570
And,right now,it's the only one we've got.

175
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:08,340
Running away into the sunset with the man who lied to me?

176
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:09,630
Really?

177
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:12,070
I mean,did you know about the other guys?

178
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:14,910
Did you know that I would be putting t-bag back out on to the street?

179
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:17,600
I never meant for that to happen.

180
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:20,330
I was doing what I needed to do.

181
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:24,220
My brother was going to die.
Well,my father's dead.

182
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:40,410
I am sorry about your father.

183
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:44,630
I'm sorry for a lot of things.

184
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:46,890
For what I did to you.

185
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:54,300
I have many,many regrets,but that's the biggest.

186
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:56,970
it does not help me right now

187
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,970
I'm sorry for that,too.

188
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:07,900
I didn't expect you to,uh...

189
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:12,090
I didn't expect you forgive me.

190
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:16,100
But I don't want you,to,uh...

191
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:20,030
I don't want you to be alone in this.

192
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:33,370
I don't want to be alone.

193
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,970
let's go.

194
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,260
get into the car

195
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:47,490
You can't get out this way.go back is the only way out of here

196
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:49,860
xxxx

197
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:07,970
Hold on.just hold on

198
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,350
micheal,what r u doing?
just hold on

199
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,210
come on

200
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:34,270
micheal

201
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,500
u alright?

202
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:48,170
He's still behind us.

203
00:18:58,310 --> 00:18:59,550
hold on

204
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,180
On your feet,bagwell.

205
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:47,090
Skewers are hot.

206
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,910
he's got a key

207
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:07,350
I'm going to get that key if i have to...

208
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,090
we're going to see that key again,friend.

209
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:30,760
We're going to see it real soon.

210
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:36,920
Give me my credit card.

211
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:39,100
What did you get me?

212
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,510
What did you get?

213
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:49,050
Prune juice,smokes,a little dip,and a bag of sliders.

214
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,310
What do you want first?

215
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:56,160
Looks like a chew guy to me.

216
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:09,750
No spitting.

217
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:13,040
He's had worse things in his mouth.

218
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:54,010
what do you want,fernando,from the future?

219
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:58,940
Would you run if I said you?

220
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:03,030
Would you chase me if I did?

221
00:22:18,890 --> 00:22:21,000
we got to get back to my car.

222
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,500
It's too far.

223
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:26,860
If we go now,before he gets more people...

224
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:29,050
he's not gonna call for backup.

225
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:32,190
he wants his privacy.

226
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:33,500
Why?

227
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:35,980
He's not trying to catch me.

228
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:42,510
He's trying to kill me.

229
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:51,290
Your grandfather.

230
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:55,740
He was the reason I was set up in the first place.

231
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:59,690
He used to work for the people who wanted me dead.

232
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:02,260
This is all just to get to him.

233
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:05,560
Your father should be arriving any minute.

234
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,960
Jane,right?

235
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:12,670
Sorry.

236
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:15,050
Don't worry about it.

237
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:17,010
You know my dad?

238
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,390
Well?

239
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:22,060
Well enough.

240
00:23:22,090 --> 00:23:24,050
We used to work together.

241
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:27,120
Ah,the company.

242
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:28,610
Yeah.

243
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:30,110
But that was a long time ago.

244
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:32,930
And now I work against them,just like he does.

245
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,560
So I guess you walked out on your family,too.

246
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:38,170
No explanations,no good-byes.
I don't have a family.

247
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,990
Lincoln,he really wants to see you and your brother.

248
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:43,410
He hasn't seen michael since he was ten years old.

249
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,120
They're here.

250
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,300
Wait here.

251
00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:57,440
let's go

252
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:59,200
Where are we going?

253
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:01,350
Michael never met your grandfather.

254
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:02,590
Hey!

255
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,290
Dad.

256
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,710
I don't want to get trapped in here.

257
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:19,270
There's got to be an exit on the other side.

258
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:23,240
You go on.
Michael.

259
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:25,170
i'll be right behind u.Go.

260
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:41,740
the news is not good.
Burrows was intercepted before I got here.

261
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:43,850
It is a setback,
but we're not that far behind.

262
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:46,670
Paul,paul,calm down.

263
00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:49,390
It'll be all right.
Someone will take care of it.

264
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,600
Someone... who?

265
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:55,040
Bill,tell me you're not bringing
someone else in on this.

266
00:25:55,050 --> 00:25:57,200
You didn't think you were
alone on this,did you?

267
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:00,520
You're a soldier. There's an army.

268
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:05,140
Tell me,what do you have on sara tancredi?

269
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:06,770
What does that have to do with this?

270
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:08,540
Go back to your original assignment.

271
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:12,320
Bill,I'm here now. I can do this,
and then... the girl.

272
00:26:13,810 --> 00:26:15,480
We need to know what her father told her.

273
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:19,290
When you find out,give me a call.

274
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:28,930
This is agent kellerman. I need that
rental car information on sara tancredi.

275
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:13,770
Yeah,this is it right here.

276
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:18,370
75-foot twin diesel azimut,

277
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:22,810
flybridge,panoramics, you pull up in
a boat like that,you're somebody.

278
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:25,350
- Let me see.
- Get off.

279
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:37,710
how ya doin',bagwell?

280
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,110
Get the stool.

281
00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:45,830
- What stool?
- The stool.

282
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:57,330
It's from one of them lockers in a bus station.

283
00:28:58,130 --> 00:29:00,060
I'll try not to think about where it's been.

284
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,040
911 Calling...

285
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,960
no,no,no,no-- don't do that,now. Come on.

286
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:16,450
Hey,there. Send the police.
Some scumbag broke into my house.

287
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:19,100
Yeah,1505 marberry hill.

288
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:22,200
- Is he still there?
- Yeah,you better come quick.

289
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,340
let's hit it,roy.

290
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:25,930
Come on,now,please don't do this.

291
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:27,680
Don't-- just don't leave me like this,okay?

292
00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:29,690
I can take you right to the money,
I know right where it is.

293
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:31,340
So do I. Adios.

294
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:33,550
I'm begging you,don't do this. Please!

295
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:36,240
Geary,come on,we can make a deal,
man. Come on,come on.

296
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:37,560
No deals.

297
00:29:37,570 --> 00:29:40,030
You just crapped out your last bargaining chip,pal.

298
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:42,010
Please!

299
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:32,380
I wouldn't do that if I were you,alex.

300
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:35,130
You smell that?

301
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,980
It's propane.

302
00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:39,050
It's filling the room.

303
00:30:39,650 --> 00:30:43,740
And if you pull that trigger,we both die.

304
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,780
I'll do it. I'll do it!

305
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:00,940
Maybe.

306
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:06,080
But before you do,let me ask you a question,alex.

307
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:10,340
Do you think you're still one of
the good guys fighting the good fight?

308
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:12,950
Because I think we both know you've crossed over.

309
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:15,800
You're on the wrong,side chasing the wrong guys.

310
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:20,040
My brother is innocent. He never killed anyone.

311
00:31:20,050 --> 00:31:22,390
Oh,thanks for opening my eyes.

312
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:26,200
Okay,alex,shoot.

313
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:27,950
We both know what will happen.

314
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:31,950
The propane will kill me anyway,what difference
does it make? Might as well do it right now.

315
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,530
That's a good point.

316
00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:41,370
there. There!

317
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:43,970
That'll give you some time to
think about what you're doing.

318
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:46,920
But first,a word of advice: Stop.

319
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:51,910
Because when you get close,I will win every time.

320
00:31:53,910 --> 00:31:55,150
You think?

321
00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:00,900
- I'm not the one in the cage.
- No,you're not.

322
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:03,840
There's one big difference between you and I,michael.

323
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:06,550
And you just proved it.

324
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:08,870
You can't kill.

325
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:11,470
And that's what it's gonna take to stop me.

326
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:14,630
'Cause I don't have the same reservations.

327
00:32:14,690 --> 00:32:15,880
I can'T.

328
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:23,440
So whether it's today in gila  or tomorrow in
albuquerque or two months from now... in panama.

329
00:32:25,770 --> 00:32:27,250
I will get you.

330
00:32:33,810 --> 00:32:35,600
I don't have a choice.

331
00:32:58,850 --> 00:33:00,400
I bought us some time.

332
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:01,700
You okay? You're bleeding.

333
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:03,320
Yeah,let's go.

334
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,370
Your seatbelt.

335
00:33:12,710 --> 00:33:15,100
TRIBURE.KANSAS

336
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:25,880
Here. 804.

337
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:27,190
Move.

338
00:33:46,690 --> 00:33:50,270
Ain't that the most beautiful
thing you ever seen?

339
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,840
All that green.

340
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:54,920
It's prettier than the grand canyon.

341
00:33:54,970 --> 00:33:57,450
You know,roy,this is a monumental
moment for both of us.

342
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:59,110
Hand over the bag,bellick.

343
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,010
Put down the pounder,grandma.

344
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:03,090
Hey,hey. I am not kidding around.

345
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:04,980
Well,you think your pansy ass...

346
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:21,720
Next time,you pick through the crap.

347
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:55,560
Okay,first-aid kit,disposable phones,
couple of toothbrushes.

348
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:57,290
What about the motel?

349
00:34:57,380 --> 00:35:00,070
They charge by the hour,
so they didn't ask for id.

350
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:09,370
- Do you have the keys?
- Yeah.

351
00:35:28,690 --> 00:35:32,600
Sorry,we're not home. Leave a message
at the beep and we'll get back to you.

352
00:35:32,610 --> 00:35:35,770
Listen. Is message is for maricruz.

353
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,830
I was right there waiting for your call,

354
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:41,500
but the cops showed up and
i couldn't pick up the phone.

355
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:45,650
I know probably that's the exact reason
why you may not want to be with me.

356
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:48,690
Listen to me.

357
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:52,090
My aunt idalyz,she lives outside mexico city,

358
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:57,510
in the mountains,on a farm,with...
with a llama for the baby to ride.

359
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:05,260
So,next week,when you fly back home,
when you go to the airport,I'll be there.

360
00:36:05,410 --> 00:36:08,570
In the airport. In ixtapa I'll wait for you.

361
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:10,420
I promise you,marita.

362
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:16,100
I love you,mari.I love you more than anything
and I can't live without you.

363
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:20,950
I just know I can make it work,baby.

364
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:27,280
This is,uh,in case you run into trouble down the road.

365
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:34,950
I have a way.

366
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,410
- Where is she?
- Who?

367
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:38,610
Maricruz. She wasn't home
and she's not at work.

368
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:40,850
Well,she's not here.
I don't know where she is.

369
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:43,790
You want problems,kalinda? Don't lie to me.

370
00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:53,580
She went to mexico,didn't she?

371
00:36:55,690 --> 00:36:57,560
And on our honeymoon.

372
00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:01,120
Paid for with my money.

373
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,660
This isn't gonna feel good.

374
00:37:08,050 --> 00:37:10,930
I have a high tolerance for pain.
You know that.

375
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,140
You do.

376
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:16,620
And you're not a diabetic,are you?

377
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,120
All right.

378
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,130
Michael,tell me something.

379
00:37:35,450 --> 00:37:37,590
You think there's a part of you that enjoys this?

380
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:40,660
Peroxide in an open wound? No.

381
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:43,890
I mean escaping from prison

382
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:49,260
and being on the run and the danger and
the fear and the rush,all that.

383
00:37:49,270 --> 00:37:51,400
It,uh...

384
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:55,540
it feels to me likE... chasing a high.

385
00:37:57,250 --> 00:38:02,130
And... and I know what that's like and...

386
00:38:02,470 --> 00:38:05,510
I should know better by now.

387
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,500
I never thought about it like that.

388
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:22,140
I know you've heard this before,
but it won't always be like this.

389
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:25,280
From everything you've told me,
it's just getting worse.

390
00:38:25,290 --> 00:38:27,460
They can't chase us forever.

391
00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:31,970
The guy who caught up with us today,he stops
at the border,and that's why we have to get across.

392
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:35,970
And I have the people in place to help us do that.
We're meeting them tomorrow.

393
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,570
One more day,sara.

394
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:44,100
One more day.

395
00:38:45,910 --> 00:38:47,680
That's all I'm asking.

396
00:38:49,810 --> 00:38:51,510
You can go get cleaned up.

397
00:38:52,050 --> 00:38:53,330
Keep this dry.

398
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:09,340
Sara.

399
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:14,670
I'm glad you came.

400
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:26,810
So...

401
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:30,910
- this is him.
- Lincoln,jr.

402
00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:35,530
- You named him after yourself.
- I wasn't gonna name him aldo.

403
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:45,700
Lj,this is your grandfather,aldo burrows.

404
00:39:50,290 --> 00:39:53,010
Waited for this for a long time.

405
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:03,110
I've arranged a safe place for both of you to go to.

406
00:40:05,730 --> 00:40:10,370
Well,thanks for bailing us out,
but,uh,we got to meet michael.

407
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:12,040
Where is he?

408
00:40:12,050 --> 00:40:15,780
Down by the border,a place called bolshoi booze.

409
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:18,730
- I can go alone and get him.
- No.

410
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:25,420
Things are different. There's some evidence.

411
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:29,450
We just need a little more time,and we
can blow this whole thing wide open...

412
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:31,850
but there is no time. I trust michael

413
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:33,350
he has a plan to get us to panama.

414
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:35,300
You don't understand.

415
00:40:35,470 --> 00:40:37,530
You don't need to go to panama.

416
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:40,700
You don't need to run anymore.

417
00:40:48,830 --> 00:40:50,370
Tell me good news.

418
00:40:51,910 --> 00:40:54,650
I got burrows-- the trifecta.

419
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:58,880
- Take care of them.
- What about scofield? They're gonna meet him.

420
00:40:58,890 --> 00:41:00,460
It doesn't matter.

421
00:41:00,470 --> 00:41:01,810
Do it now.

422
00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:41,530
sara?

423
00:43:00,070 --> 00:43:01,760
hi,sara.

424
00:43:01,990 --> 00:43:03,690


425
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:06,700
