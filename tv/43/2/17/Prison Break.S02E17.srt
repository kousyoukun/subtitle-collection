1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,200
Previously on Prison Break:

2
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:02,600
I'm breaking out,

3
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:04,500
and you're going to make sure
my brother goes with me.

4
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,630
I'm sorry, Henry.

5
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:08,100
This message is for Maricruz.

6
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:13,160
I'll be there in the airport
in Ixtapa waiting for you.

7
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:14,860
Sucre,
down the road,

8
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:15,860
if you're in trouble,

9
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:17,200
post a note
on the message board.

10
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:18,660
What's it called?

11
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:20,830
Europeangoldfinch.net

12
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:22,700
C-NOTE:
That's a bird, right?

13
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:24,160
Go pack your things.

14
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:26,060
We're moving.

15
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:27,660
We will be a family

16
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:29,500
 <i>if it kills us.</i>

17
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:31,500
KIM:
Pull this off
and you're halfway home.

18
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,600
You remember what home
is like, don't you?

19
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,300
Stay away from my family!

20
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,100
She needs that medicine--
she can't go

21
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,300
two days without it.

22
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,830
I don't feel good.

23
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:43,930
Oh, sweetie...

24
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,700
Michael, I want for this
to be over.

25
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:46,700
That makes two of us.

26
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:47,900
It's just a question of

27
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,830
looking at whatever it is your
father gave you.

28
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:50,860
It's just a key.

29
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:51,930
KELLERMAN:
It's in a lockbox

30
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,060
at the Corona
de Oro cigar club.

31
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:56,300
I'm not a wanted fugitive.
Give me the key.

32
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,800
I'll do it.

33
00:00:57,860 --> 00:00:59,530
You want to take a walk?

34
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:29,860
Miss Tancredi?

35
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:33,000
I need to have a word
with you.

36
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,330
Miss Tancredi?

37
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,060
Of course.

38
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,860
Miss Tancredi? Ma'am?

39
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:57,300
Miss Tancredi?

40
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,860
(gasps)
It's time to go.

41
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,260
Ma'am?

42
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:04,900
They're going
out the back.

43
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:11,300
(alarm ringing)

44
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,430
Come on, come on.

45
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:19,100
(alarm continues ringing)

46
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:28,960
FLIGHT ANNOUNCER (over PA):
Attention in the terminal...

47
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:33,160
Pediatrics, please.

48
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:34,560
(phone ringing)

49
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:35,830
Hello.

50
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:36,900
Cameron.

51
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:37,900
Hi, Dad.

52
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,160
How are you doing, big guy?

53
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:40,900
Good. I'm eating my lunch.

54
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,960
How is it?

55
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:43,460
Pretty disgusting.

56
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:44,730
(chuckles)

57
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,130
Maybe your mom can bring
you some dinner from home.

58
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,930
Did you see the doctor today?

59
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,130
Yeah. He said
I can go home this week as long

60
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,960
as I stay out of the street.

61
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:55,260
You're a smart young man.

62
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:57,160
You know how
to cross the street.

63
00:02:57,230 --> 00:02:58,260
Are you mad at me?

64
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:02,260
Listen to me.

65
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:06,360
No one is mad at you.

66
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:08,160
And this wasn't your fault.

67
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:10,160
I'm the one who should
have been looking out for you.

68
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:11,500
You weren't even there.

69
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:14,760
But I should have been.

70
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:16,000
(phone beeping)

71
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:17,100
Aw, man.

72
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,030
Hey, buddy, listen.
I got to go,

73
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,460
but I'll call you back later,
okay?

74
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:22,630
Cameron...
Okay. Bye.

75
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,100
(phone beeping)
I love you.

76
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,430
(receiver clicks)

77
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,930
Cam?

78
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,960
(beeping continues)

79
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:31,300
Yeah.

80
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,500
What have we got on Franklin?

81
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,700
Nothing new

82
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,960
since this morning.

83
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:36,360
Another witness
from the Minnesota diner robbery

84
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:37,630
gave a positive I.D.

85
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,460
Good. 'Cause I just landed
in Minneapolis

86
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:41,260
15 minutes ago. Anything else?

87
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:43,160
Yeah. The girl. Dede.

88
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:45,330
Apparently, she's been ill,
some chronic condition.

89
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,960
Fax Franklin's mug shot
to every hospital

90
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:49,900
in southeastern Minnesota.

91
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,560
Already done. With any luck,

92
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:54,860
she'll get sick enough to need
one, then he'll show his face.

93
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:57,760
You don't have kids,
do you, Lang?

94
00:03:57,830 --> 00:03:59,060
Nope.

95
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:02,000
Call me when
you have something else.

96
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:04,400
I'll take that.

97
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:12,360
We didn't get it.
What?

98
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:14,230
And we need to get back
in there soon.

99
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:16,460
Once the Company finds out
Sara was in there,

100
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:18,160
it won't be long before
they start wondering why.

101
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:21,260
Find a spot close to
the club and sit tight.

102
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:22,760
We're going to take the car.

103
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:24,600
We'll be back
in a couple of hours.
Where you going?

104
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:25,960
MICHAEL:
Turns out that maybe

105
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:27,330
there's one member of
the club who can help us.

106
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,900
Who?

107
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,360
Pope?

108
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:33,700
(knock at door)

109
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,260
Just a minute.

110
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:39,630
Henry.

111
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,100
What are you doing here?

112
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,600
Aside from jumping bail

113
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:46,200
and evading
the authorities?

114
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:47,530
There's something
that you need to hear,

115
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,060
but, first, I need to
know if you'll listen.

116
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:51,700
I can assure you, Sara,
we've got nothing to discuss.

117
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,000
Sir, please.
I need five minutes.

118
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,530
After that, if you want us to,
we'll leave.

119
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,630
Who's "us"?

120

121
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:36,030
I don't want any trouble.

122
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:38,030
Good. Because
that's not why we're here.

123
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,160
What the hell
are you thinking about,

124
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:42,400
waltzing in here?
You're a wanted criminal!

125
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:43,930
In case you've forgotten,
I dedicated

126
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,230
my career-- my entire life--

127
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,930
to keeping people
like you behind bars.

128
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,660
You're talking
about guilty people.

129
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:51,330
My brother is innocent.

130
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,100
And we may have the
evidence to prove it.

131
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,430
Well, I don't care;
I want you out of here.

132
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:57,430
It's in a lockbox
at the Corona del Oro club,

133
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,760
and you're a member.

134
00:05:58,830 --> 00:05:59,930
Out!

135
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,360
Henry, please listen.

136
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:04,730
Sara, I'm tempted to say
you should have known better.

137
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,430
But after
what you did...

138
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,060
My father was looking
into the Burrows case

139
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:09,660
when he was murdered.

140
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:11,800
This key is the only thing
I could recover from his body.

141
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,600
Where are we going?

142
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,430
They're hungry.

143
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,960
We've been driving all day.

144
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:41,130
Chick-O-Stick.

145
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,000
They need real food.

146
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:46,630
Soon enough, pumpkin.

147
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,400
Alackaday.

148
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:09,930
Miscreants.
Defilers. Defacers.

149
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,760
Despoilers.

150
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,260
(mutters softly)

151
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:21,930
What is this?

152
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,760
My home.

153
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:39,630
(engine sputters out)

154
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:42,160
Aw, no, no, no!

155
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:45,060
(groaning):
No.

156
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:48,900
(engine grinding,
horn honking)

157
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:57,500
(slams door)

158
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,860
(strikes car)

159
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:12,500
(vehicle approaching)

160
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,600
Hey!

161
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,060
 <i>Por favor,</i>
please, please.

162
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:43,760
(radio emitting static)

163
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:24,100
Okay. All right, sweetie, why
don't you sit over here, okay?

164
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,430
All right.

165
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,000
I'm going
to go over there

166
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:28,500
and I'm going to
talk to the lady.

167
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,730
All right? You need anything?

168
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,560
You sure?

169
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:34,330
Okay.

170
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:38,960
Yes?

171
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:41,730
My daughter, Dede,
she's really sick.

172
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,460
She's had this kidney
thing since she,

173
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:44,660
she was real young.

174
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:46,300
It's mostly...
Where is she?

175
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,700
She's sitting right there.

176
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,330
Have you
been here before?

177
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,860
No. I'm from out of town.

178
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:52,460
Can I see your insurance card?

179
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:55,360
Um... no, no.

180
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:57,100
I don't have any insurance.

181
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,430
After I left the army,
they discontinued my insurance.

182
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,630
Are you a resident
of Hennepin County?

183
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:05,130
Like I said,
we're from out of town.

184
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,930
You have a driver's license?

185
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,960
Look, I don't have
a driver's license,

186
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:12,100
an insurance card,
or anything like that,

187
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,430
but I do know the law.

188
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,330
You have to see my little girl.

189
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:18,430
Let me go get my supervisor.

190
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,900
Good.

191
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,760
I don't give a rat's ass
about you or your brother.

192
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:28,630
I trusted you,
I took you

193
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,960
under my wing, I treated you
like my own son.

194
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:32,460
I believed you!

195
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:34,130
Day after day,
you lied to me.

196
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,730
What kind
of a man does that?

197
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,060
A desperate one.

198
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:42,630
Yeah. Well...

199
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:45,300
you two made a big mistake
coming here today.

200
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,160
You give me no choice.

201
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:49,860
I'm going to notify
the authorities right now.

202
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:52,860
I'm sorry...

203
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:56,200
...but I can't let you do that.

204
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,300
ou, Henry.

205
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,500
Said by the man with the gun.

206
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,300
If it's the only way I can
convince you, so be it.

207
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,960
Well, you're not going
to convince me by doing that.

208
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:11,300
I'm not the man
you think I am.

209
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,330
Yeah, well, I have a pretty good
idea who you are, Michael.

210
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,760
If that's true,

211
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:17,000
then you already know I never
wanted to be in Fox River.

212
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:18,830
I never wanted to
meet you, Henry.

213
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,730
I certainly didn't want
to ruin your life.

214
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,730
(chuckling):
Yeah. Well, you've done
a pretty damn good job.

215
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,330
You're not saying anything
to him I haven't said myself,

216
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,560
Henry.
I've looked into this.

217
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:28,930
What he's saying to you
is absolutely true.

218
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,730
I just want my brother's
life back.

219
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,360
I want people to know the truth.

220
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:33,800
I'd give anything
for that.

221
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,360
I'd lay down my life.

222
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:36,430
Well, that's easy
for you to say,

223
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,960
standing on that side
of the gun.

224
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,360
What if I'm standing
on this side?

225
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:53,100
There are places that
can better serve your needs.

226
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,500
Look, I know my rights, okay?

227
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,760
This isn't a primary
care facility.

228
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:58,030
We provide necessary care

229
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,200
in life-threatening
situations.

230
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,260
Look, I know what this is.

231
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:01,460
Are you going to wait
until she's dead

232
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:02,560
before you give her
some help?

233
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:03,730
Is that what
you're telling me?!

234
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,230
I'm not going to argue
with you, sir.

235
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:07,730
This is a hospital,
not a homeless shelter.

236
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,500
A what?

237
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,100
What did you just say to me?

238
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,400
I can't believe you people.

239
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,330
Come on.

240
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,930
The line is a little
bit too long, okay?

241
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,460
We'll go somewhere else.

242
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:30,200
Where are we going?

243
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:32,260
We got to find another
doctor, sweetie.

244
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:36,630
Oh, my God.

245
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:37,960
Let's go.

246
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:43,930
Move!

247
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:50,800
Come on, baby.

248
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:01,300
Franklin!

249
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,700
Move out of the way!

250
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,160
FBI! Stop!

251
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:12,700
Stop!

252
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,060
Okay.

253
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:15,330
Okay.

254
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,630
Okay, okay.

255
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:18,830
All right.

256
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:22,560
Just one second, baby.
Baby, you got to get down, okay?

257
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:23,930
No!
No, no, sweetie,

258
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,160
you got to get down.
You got to let
him go, honey.

259
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:26,300
Get down.
Get down.

260
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,660
Honey, you got
to let him go.

261
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:28,560
No.

262
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,660
Man, she's not letting go.

263
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:34,030
Don't let her pay
for your mistakes.

264
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:36,060
(bell sounds,
air brakes express air)

265
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:37,500
You hear me?

266
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:54,960
I could shoot you right now
and not even think twice.

267
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:56,060
But you won't.

268
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:58,500
You spent too much time
around prisons

269
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,260
to throw your life
away like that.

270
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:02,200
What the hell are you
trying to pull?

271
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:03,500
It's simple-- that's the key

272
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:05,330
to an innocent
man's freedom.

273
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,530
Come on, Henry.

274
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,430
We both know there's
something going on here.

275
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,500
Too many people
have died.

276
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,600
Look me in the eye,
tell me you don't believe

277
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,360
there's a cover-up
going on right now.

278
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:17,900
I've got no moral obligations
here, Michael.

279
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:21,860
As far as I know,
Lincoln is as guilty as hell.

280
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:24,400
Then take a ten-minute drive
with me, and we'll find out.

281
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:26,230
That's all I ask.

282
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,860
Henry, you've looked
into this before.

283
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:28,930
You've thought about it.

284
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,260
I have.

285
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:34,930
And I've come
to one conclusion--

286
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,360
this has nothing to do with me.

287
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:40,100
But I am a man
of the law,

288
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,860
and right now,
I've got a convicted felon

289
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:43,600
standing inside my house.

290
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:46,660
Well, maybe there's something
I can offer you

291
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:48,760
to make you change your mind.

292
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:05,300
(door creaking)

293
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:37,860
===============================3==================================

294
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,460
(kicks dresser)

295
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:15,930
(page rustling)

296
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,960
(laughter echoing)

297
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:25,460
What do you intend
to do with us?

298
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:29,500
 <i>You grease monkey.</i>

299
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,460
You don't deserve
minimum wage.

300
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:34,500
The hell I don't,
working graveyard.

301
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,360
There ain't no man
deserve more pennies

302
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:39,030
on a dollar per hour
than they got IQ points

303
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,630
in their head.
I ain't stupid.

304
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:44,330
Seems equal stupid
as the rest of you.

305
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:48,430
Seems to run in the genes.

306
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:50,900
Teddy.

307
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:53,300
Ten <i>symonyms.</i>

308
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,560
Pick a word.

309
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,460
Pick a word.

310
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,700
Destroy.

311
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:06,760
Ten synonyms for "destroy."

312
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:15,030
Annul.

313
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,760
Mutilate.

314
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,730
Liquidate.

315
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:23,860
Abrogate.

316
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:25,860
Quell. Ravage.

317
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:27,860
Expunge.

318
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:29,300
Demolish.

319
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,530
Extirpate.

320
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,960
Extinguish.

321
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,260
Whoo, you see that?!

322
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:36,400
Stupid, my pail,
my boy's

323
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:38,960
 <i>gonna be president.</i>

324
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:47,300
(sighs)

325
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,760
(creaks loudly)

326
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:04,260
 <i>How come you ain't</i>

327
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:06,160
studying?

328
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:08,930
'Cause I'm tired.

329
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,800
'Cause I feel like
a circus freak.

330
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:19,100
Well...

331
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,530
now...

332
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:26,460
it's in your own
best interest.

333
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:28,830
Don't you
understand that?

334
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,530
Hmm?

335
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:40,700
Now, you're going
to be president someday.

336
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:47,000
You mark my words.

337
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,560
SUSAN:
Theodore.

338
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:56,800
Theodore, do you hear me?

339
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:58,930
What are you going
to do with us?

340
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:20,860
We're gonna put down some roots.

341
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:24,660
You wanted me
dead, Paul.

342
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:26,700
Just following orders.

343
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,600
Sent me to the chair
for something I didn't do,

344
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:30,360
all for your president.

345
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:31,600
You were willing to do that.

346
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:36,000
Just... following... orders.

347
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:37,430
Steadman said you loved her.

348
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:40,060
Steadman was a deranged man
that lived in a locked box.

349
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:41,060
You don't love someone

350
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:42,860
that loves power
more than life.

351
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:43,930
Bitter, huh?

352
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,100
Am I?

353
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:48,430
No offense,

354
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,800
but you're not capable

355
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:51,960
of understanding
the relationship.

356
00:19:57,530 --> 00:20:01,260
Okay, any way you look at it,
there is no light

357
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:02,500
at the end
of this tunnel.

358
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:03,530
One way or another,

359
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,400
you and I, we die.

360
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:06,930
Your brother, too.

361
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,030
Which is a shame given
all he's done for you.

362
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:12,960
I have a sister I haven't talked
to in 15 years.

363
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:14,230
Think she's better off for it?

364
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:15,630
We'll make it.

365
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:17,960
What is that, faith?

366
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:19,260
Yeah, that's faith.

367
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:21,500
All I see is a black hole.

368
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,230
And sooner or later,

369
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:26,200
they are going to suck each one
of us into it.

370
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:28,660
But when they come for me,

371
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:32,330
I'm going to take as many
of them with me as I can.

372
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:36,000
She must have really
broken your heart, Paul.

373
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:37,830
==============================4===================================

374
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:42,130
President Reynolds attended
a Chicago fundraiser last night

375
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,830
as part of her two-day stop
in the Windy City.

376
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:47,660
Reynolds' popularity continues
to soar in the Midwest

377
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:50,630
with appearances scheduled
in Indianapolis, Detroit

378
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,730
and Flint, Michigan
later in the week.

379
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,160
At a Democratic fundraiser...

380
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:55,330
Mr. Kim...

381
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,730
Sarah Tancredi
surfaced in Chicago.

382
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,760
She was spotted at the Corona
de Oro Club about an hour ago.

383
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:02,000
Corona de Oro Club?

384
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:03,100
It's a cigar club.

385
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,500
Her father was a member.

386
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,630
He kept a private humidor there.

387
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:14,860
Get me a jet to Chicago.

388
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:21,800
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

389
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,150
XXXXXXXXXXXX

390
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,350
XXXXXXXXX

391
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:28,340
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

392
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:32,680
XXXXXXXXXXXX

393
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:34,880
XXXXXXXXXXXX

394
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,750
XXXXXXXXXXXX

395
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:47,670
XXXXXXXXXXXX

396
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:51,080
XXXXXXXXXXXX

397
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:59,360
Tell me you're not still
thinking he's going to show.

398
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:01,600
He's let you down
so many times.

399
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:02,900
You know that.

400
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,630
Yeah, well, maybe
it's the baby in me

401
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,660
that's telling me that
this time it's going
to be different.

402
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:09,130
I don't mean
to burst your bubble,

403
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,160
but he's not
going to show.

404
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,830
Bubble's not burst.

405
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:22,460
I got three
words for you.

406
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:24,130
Yeah?

407
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,330
We gotta run.

408
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,260
Good seeing you, Theresa!

409
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,060
 <i>Andale!</i>

410
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:52,430
I'm so glad you came.

411
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,830
You're crazy.

412
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:57,460
How did they know?

413
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:15,760
You're certain...

414
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:17,830
about what's in the box?

415
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:21,200
No, but it's all we've got.

416
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:25,230
Thank you, Henry.

417
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,830
You sure about this?

418
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:41,900
No.

419
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,860
Either way,

420
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:46,830
you still owe me dinner.

421
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:49,600
Is that so?

422
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:52,060
Yeah. First week

423
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:53,560
in Fox River, you promised me,
if you ever

424
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:55,100
got out of there,
you'd take me to dinner.

425
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:57,800
Well, maybe, after we wrap
this up, we can stop off

426
00:23:57,860 --> 00:23:59,730
and get you a burrito
on the way back to Pope's house.

427
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,960
Scofield, I don't know
what you're used to,

428
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:03,460
but anything short
of a filet mignon

429
00:24:03,530 --> 00:24:04,700
is not going to cut it with me.

430
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:08,860
It's a date.

431
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,030
Hey.

432
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,400
How did you pull that off?

433
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:30,630
I'll tell you later.

434
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:32,600
Is he in yet?
Yep.

435
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:34,130
This shouldn't take more
than a couple of minutes.

436
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,600
Any longer than that,
we'll know we've got trouble.

437
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,930
This way.

438
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,330
Thank you.

439
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:46,400
Mr. Pope.

440
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:48,460
Hey, Warren
How's it going?

441
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:50,060
Did you hear what
happened this morning?

442
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:51,500
Sara Tancredi came in.

443
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,860
Yeah. So I heard.

444
00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:56,800
Next time,
don't let her get away.

445
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:58,700
Thanks.

446
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:32,400
* *=========================5========================

447
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:56,700
Excuse me, do you mind

448
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,330
if I borrow your computer
for a moment?

449
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,360
No problem.

450
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:00,860
Thanks.

451
00:26:06,930 --> 00:26:08,400
(glass bottles tinkling)

452
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,500
Pitch in, chitlins!

453
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:15,630
We can't do this.

454
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:16,960
We can't live here.

455
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:19,000
No, of course
not like this.

456
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:21,230
We gonna clean.
We are cleaning!

457
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:22,630
We gonna rebuild!

458
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:24,130
You can't do this to them.

459
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,660
Look at them.

460
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:34,460
Y'all mind coming along here
for a minute.

461
00:26:34,530 --> 00:26:36,860
Come on.

462
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:38,560
I think we're past me
waving that gun around,

463
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:39,900
don't you think?

464
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,530
Come on.

465
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,430
Thank you.

466
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,800
What are you doing?

467
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:46,300
Nothing is gonna
happen to them.

468
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,330
Susan. Susie Q.

469
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,300
Do you think I'd
bring you here

470
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,030
to so sacred a place
to me as this

471
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:53,600
if I meant you ill?

472
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:54,860
Look at me!

473
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:01,030
I am not the animal
you think you see before you.

474
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:06,500
I am the laws of karma
all come down wrong.

475
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,630
Don't you
understand?

476
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:08,800
I don't.

477
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:15,830
What I'm trying
to say is that...

478
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:21,060
I am the sin of my father.

479
00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:24,800
Why are you telling me this?

480
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:28,330
Because I love you.

481
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,960
Because I want you
to understand me.

482
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:34,960
I am the last in the line
of Bagwells.

483
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:39,330
The tail end
of a corrupted breed.

484
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,730
The earth, thank God,

485
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,760
shall see no more
of our generations.

486
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:58,500
I cannot procreate, Susan.

487
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:01,660
And yet, there's
something in that

488
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:04,100
that gives me
great hope.

489
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:06,360
No more Bagwells
shall roam this planet.

490
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:08,630
Not with that vile
blood in their veins.

491
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:09,760
All I want to do

492
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:12,700
is end the bloodline,
extirpate it,

493
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:15,800
and start another, afresh.

494
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,330
A new family.

495
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,630
Oh, Teddy.

496
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:20,830
Those children
are my salvation,

497
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:24,330
my chance to make this world
a better place.

498
00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:30,230
I will be
good, Susan.

499
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:32,230
I will love them.

500
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:33,800
I will love you.

501
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:35,800
I will take communion,
be baptized

502
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:39,130
under a truer light.

503
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,460
All I ask

504
00:28:40,530 --> 00:28:43,160
is that you
love me back,

505
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:46,430
just a little.

506
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:49,600
Or learn to do so in time.

507
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:52,900
Can you do
that, Susan?

508
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,630
I can't.

509
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:07,060
I can't.

510
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:20,100
I'm sorry.

511
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:28,700
SUSAN:
Teddy.

512
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:29,760
(pounding)

513
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:31,100
Teddy.
(pounding)

514
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,130
GRACEY:
Mommy.

515
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,530
SUSAN:
Please, please.

516
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,560
(pounding)

517
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:36,900
Teddy, it's okay, it's okay.

518
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,060
(pounding)

519
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:41,100
(Susan sobbing)

520
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:43,630
Teddy.

521
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:46,660
(sobbing):
Teddy, please.

522
00:29:46,730 --> 00:29:47,700
Teddy.

523
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,660
(Susan sobbing)

524
00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:51,760
Teddy, I'm sorry.

525
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:55,400
I can do it.

526
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:57,800
I can love you.

527
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:15,730
Where are we?

528
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,760
(whispering):
At the doctor's
office, sweetie.

529
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:21,100
Hello.

530
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,560
Hello, I have an
emergency in here.

531
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:28,830
Hello?

532
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:39,130
Hello.

533
00:30:42,530 --> 00:30:44,130
Hey, you
the doctor?

534
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,530
Need to wait your turn.

535
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,600
No, it is my turn.
This is an emergency right here.

536
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:49,600
I need you to look
at my daughter, okay?

537
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:52,100
She's not feeling
too good.

538
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,130
Please.

539
00:30:56,660 --> 00:31:00,430
Sweetie, hold on,
so I can...

540
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:03,900
All right, look, this is
all the money I got, okay?

541
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,560
That's $400.

542
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:13,060
Please look at my daughter.

543
00:31:13,130 --> 00:31:15,200
What's the matter
with her?

544
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:19,130
She has a kidney disease-- PKD.

545
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,500
Normally, we have it under
control, but I don't like

546
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:22,660
what I'm seeing
right now.

547
00:31:22,730 --> 00:31:24,660
Her stomach hurts, okay?

548
00:31:24,730 --> 00:31:25,830
And she's always hot.

549
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:27,830
How's her appetite?
It's gone.

550
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:29,830
She's always tired,
ain't that right, baby?

551
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:31,530
All right.

552
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:34,900
Hop up here.

553
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,160
Thank you.

554
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:39,900
Okay.

555
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,430
He just wants to take
a good look

556
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,560
at you, okay?

557
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:44,100
SILAS:
May need to run
a few tests.

558
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:47,800
Just do what
you have to do, man.

559
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:48,900
I'm gonna be right here,

560
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,060
okay, baby?

561
00:31:50,130 --> 00:31:52,700
Okay.

562
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:57,660
(line ringing)

563
00:31:57,730 --> 00:31:59,230
LINCOLN:
Yeah.
What's going on now?

564
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:00,760
Still in there.

565
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:02,700
This is taking too long.

566
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,830
LINCOLN:
Wait, wait, wait.

567
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:06,200
Here he comes.

568
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:14,030
What's happening?

569
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:16,260
We got company.

570
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:25,900
P
I didn't know you were
a cigar man.

571
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,730
Who are you?

572
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,730
Uh, a friend.

573
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,130
A colleague, in fact.

574
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,360
We're both
in law enforcement.

575
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:33,560
I'm not anymore.

576
00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:35,500
That's right.

577
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:38,160
You're, uh, retired.

578
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:41,500
Know the guy?
Yeah.

579
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:46,630
Looks like the lifestyle's
treating you well.
Yeah?

580
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:48,160
Socializing over

581
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:49,630
Cubans and cognac?

582
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:51,430
Uh-huh.

583
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:55,260
But that's not what
you were doing, is it?

584
00:32:56,830 --> 00:32:59,000
Henry.

585
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:02,260
You don't mind if ask you
to empty your pockets?

586
00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:03,700
As a matter
of fact, I do.

587
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,260
I'm not going to play
any games with you.

588
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:10,830
We both know why
you came here today.

589
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:15,360
I suggest you get out
of my way, young man.

590
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:19,560
I can't do that.

591
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:25,060
Unless you'd like

592
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:26,530
to cause serious trouble
for yourself

593
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,360
and your family,
(starts vehicle)

594
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:31,660
I advise you to hand over
whatever it is you found.

595
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,400
Now.

596
00:33:37,930 --> 00:33:38,860
Michael?

597
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:41,060
(engine revs and tires screech)

598
00:33:46,430 --> 00:33:48,060
(tires screech)

599
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,200
Get in!

600
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:05,360
(groans)

601
00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:09,730
(gunshot)

602
00:34:13,830 --> 00:34:14,830
Let's go!

603
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:16,830
Linc!

604
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:19,930
(sirens approaching)

605
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:29,400
Sara!

606
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:31,900
(siren wailing)

607
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:41,030
(whimpering)

608
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:52,360
(clattering, squeaking)

609
00:34:53,930 --> 00:34:55,530
(gasping)

610
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,930
Whoa, whoa, it's
okay, it's okay.

611
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,500
Easy, easy, it's
okay, it's okay.

612
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,730
(sighs)

613
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,430
Ma'am, are you all right?

614
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:05,800
I don't understand.

615
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:07,360
We got a call.

616
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:09,560
Someone said there's a
hostage situation here.

617
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:13,230
No one knew we were here.

618
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:16,430
(sobbing)

619
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:34,430
(sobbing continues)

620
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,060
Are you okay?

621
00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:38,460
Okay.

622
00:35:38,530 --> 00:35:40,260
Hey, so what's
going on?

623
00:35:40,330 --> 00:35:43,160
I'm afraid your daughter
shows signs of renal failure.

624
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:46,030
She ever had
hemodialysis?

625
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:48,930
No, hemo... No.

626
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
No, this has never
really gone that far.

627
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,360
What, are you planning
on doing it right here?

628
00:35:56,430 --> 00:35:58,760
(chuckling):
We're not set up for it.

629
00:35:58,830 --> 00:36:00,430
And neither is she.

630
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:01,930
But there is

631
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,400
a county dialysis clinic
a few blocks away.

632
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:06,830
But we're gonna have
to place a catheter

633
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:11,030
in her neck
so she can be examined.

634
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:14,530
Hold on, sweetie, this is
gonna be a little cold.

635
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:15,700
It's okay, baby.

636
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,230
Whoa, whoa, wait,
wait, wait.

637
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:26,530
Wait, what, what is that?

638
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,730
It's a trocar.

639
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,560
It's used for placing
the catheter.

640
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:31,960
I got her.

641
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:39,030
Do we really have to go
this far?

642
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:41,230
Look.

643
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:43,330
I'm doing the best I can here,

644
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,700
but you got to understand
something.

645
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,330
Your daughter is sick.

646
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,860
Now, this may look like a
desperate measure because it is.

647
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:58,160
This is gonna hurt
a little bit.

648
00:36:58,230 --> 00:36:59,030
Stop!

649
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:00,160
Stop.

650
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:02,860
Come on, baby.

651
00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:04,700
Come with me.

652
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,330
I can't do this.

653
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,930
What's going on?

654
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,760
I made a deal with Pope.

655
00:37:33,830 --> 00:37:36,060
You made a deal with Pope?

656
00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:37,730
What kind of deal?

657
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:41,200
If he came with us and
if we got what we needed,

658
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:44,230
I said I'd turn
myself in.

659
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:45,800
What?!

660
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:47,630
We don't even know
what this thing is!

661
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:48,900
It could be nothing,
Michael.

662
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,630
You know about this?

663
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:52,730
Not until it came
out of his mouth.

664
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,260
It's the only thing
I could think of.

665
00:37:55,330 --> 00:37:57,100
You two can still finish this.

666
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:59,430
You'll just have to do it
without me.

667
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:00,960
I'm not gonna
let you do this,
Michael.

668
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:02,230
Just...

669
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:03,600
There's no coming back
from this.

670
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:07,430
Hold on.

671
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:09,360
What's the holdup?

672
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:10,660
Your brother's right.

673
00:38:10,730 --> 00:38:11,900
I wouldn't count
on the courts

674
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,430
to show you any
leniency in this.

675
00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:17,630
That doesn't matter.

676
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:19,260
I said I'd hold up
my end of the deal.

677
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:22,860
You already did.

678
00:38:22,930 --> 00:38:25,160
I listened to this.

679
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:26,630
You have something here.

680
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:28,200
There's gonna be a lot
of people

681
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:29,660
who wish you didn't,
but you do.

682
00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:31,530
Listen, Henry...

683
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,000
I'd go now
if I were you.

684
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:35,660
And don't consider this
forgiveness.

685
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:38,830
In fact, I'm about ten seconds
away from changing my mind.

686
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:41,930
Thank you.

687
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:53,100
(engine starting)

688
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,730
(distant siren wailing)

689
00:38:58,730 --> 00:39:01,100
Okay...

690
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:06,060
Here, listen...

691
00:39:06,130 --> 00:39:08,460
let's tuck you in,
all right?

692
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:13,230
(car alarm blaring)

693
00:39:14,730 --> 00:39:16,660
Come on. Let's go.

694
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:18,700
(C-Note grunts)

695
00:39:19,930 --> 00:39:21,900
(sighs)

696
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,430
Let's just...

697
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:29,260
let's just sit
for a bit longer, okay?

698
00:39:31,330 --> 00:39:34,100
We're gonna go
in a little bit, okay?

699
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:44,130
(sobbing)

700
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:55,260
You know Daddy loves you
with all his heart, right?

701
00:39:55,330 --> 00:39:58,160
I love you so much.

702
00:39:58,230 --> 00:40:00,900
I'm so sorry.

703
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:04,500
I'm so sorry, baby.

704
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:25,330
MAHONE:
Yeah.

705
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,430
Got a call for you.

706
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:27,630
I'll call back.

707
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:29,360
I just heard from some clinic
up north.

708
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:31,660
They had contact with Franklin
a half an hour ago.

709
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:33,160
I think you want to take this.

710
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:35,900
Put it through.

711
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:37,730
(beep)

712
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,560
Yeah? Mahone.

713
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:41,400
Is this the man
in charge?

714
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:42,530
Oh, yeah.

715
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:44,760
My name...

716
00:40:44,830 --> 00:40:49,030
is Benjamin Miles Franklin.

717
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:54,060
And I want to turn myself in.

718
00:40:54,130 --> 00:40:55,760
But I got one condition.

719
00:40:55,830 --> 00:40:59,030
My wife, she goes free.

720
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:01,730
My little daughter,
she needs her mother.

721
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:05,930
I don't think I need to make
a deal with you, Mr. Franklin.

722
00:41:09,230 --> 00:41:11,630
And what if I got something
you need?

723
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:22,160
(heart monitor beeping)

724
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:49,230
(indistinct announcement
over PA)

725
00:41:50,930 --> 00:41:53,100
Your wife was released
an hour ago.

726
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:54,960
She'll be here soon.

727
00:41:55,030 --> 00:41:57,960
You promise me
that she will be okay.

728
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:06,500
Just hold up your
end of the deal.

729
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:10,600
I will.

730
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:16,230
I'll get you Scofield.

731
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,430
Come on.

732
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:35,530
(door closes)

733
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,900
Here we go.

734
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:46,560
You think it's
a conversation?

735
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:49,100
One they don't want us
to hear.

736
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:52,630
You ready?

737
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:54,200
Let's do it.

738
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:56,600
