Previously on prison break:

2
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:04,660
I'm breaking out,and you're going to make sure my brother goes with me.

3
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:06,240
I'm sorry,henry.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,370
This message is for maricruz.

5
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:13,080
I'll be there in the airport in ixtapa waiting for you.

6
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:17,280
Sucre,down the road,if you're in trouble,post a note on the message board.

7
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:18,560
What's it called?

00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,710
Europeangoldfinch.Net

9
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:22,360
That's a bird,right?

10
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:24,520
Go pack your things.

11
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:26,290
We're moving.

12
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:29,200
We will be a family if it kills us.

13
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,950
Pull this off and you're halfway home.

14
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:33,810
You remember what home is like,don't you?

15
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:35,750
Stay away from my family!

16
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:39,410
She needs that medicine--
she can't go two days without it.

17
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,690
I don't feel good.

18
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:44,180
Oh,sweetie...

19
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:45,980
michael,I want for this to be over.

20
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:46,950
That makes two of us.

21
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:49,580
It's just a question of looking at whatever it is your father gave you.

22
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:50,960
It's just a key.

23
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,000
It's in a lockbox at the corona de oro cigar club.

24
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:57,260
I'm not a wanted fugitive.
Give me the key.I'll do it.

25
00:00:58,700 --> 00:00:59,970
You want to take a walk?

26
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:30,500
Miss tancredi?

27
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:33,240
I need to have a word with you.

28
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:44,510
- Miss tancredi?
- Of course.

29
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:50,210
Miss tancredi?
Ma'am?

30
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:57,690
Miss tancredi?

31
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,520
it's time to go.

32
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,320
Ma'am?

33
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,690
They're going out the back.

34
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,830

Hi,dad.

40
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,800
- How are you doing,big guy?
- Good.I'm eating my lunch.

41
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,190
How is it?

42
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:43,930
Pretty disgusting.

43
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,480
maybe your mom can bring you some dinner from home.

44
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,470
- Did you see the doctor today?
- Yeah.

45
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:53,800
He said I can go home this week as long as I stay out of the street.

46
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,710
You're a smart young man.
You know how to cross the street.

47
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:58,770
Are you mad at me?

48
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,550
Listen to me.

49
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:05,790
No one is mad at you.

50
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:08,370
And this wasn't yo fault.

51
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:10,550
I'm the one who should have been looking out for you.

52
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:12,590
You weren't even there.

53
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:14,730
But I should have been.

54
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:18,570
aw,man.
Hey,buddy,listen.

55
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:20,630
I got to go,but I'll call you back later,okay?

56
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:22,480
- okay.Bye.
- Cameron...

57
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,690
I love you.

58
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,740
cam?

59
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:33,000
yeah.
What have we got on franklin?

60
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,790
Nothing new since this morning.

61
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:37,810
Another witness from the minnesota diner robbery gave a positive I.D.

62
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:40,890
Good.
'Cause I just landed in minneapolis 15 minutes ago.

63
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:43,090
- Anything else?
- Yeah.The girl.Dede.

64
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:45,890
Apparently,she's been ill,some chronic condition.

65
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:49,640
Fax franklin's mug shot to every hospital in southeastern minnesota.

66
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,990
Already done.

67
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:55,030
With any luck,she'll get sick enough to need one,then he'll show his face.

68
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:58,230
You don't have kids,do you,lang?

69
00:03:58,230 --> 00:03:59,400
Nope.

70
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:01,860
Call me when you have something else.

71
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:04,760
I'll take that.

72
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,670
- We didn't get it.
- What?

73
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:16,360
And we need to get back in there soon.
Once the company finds out sara was in there,

74
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:19,010
it won't be long before they start wondering why.

75
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:22,520
Find a spot close to the club and sit tight.
We're going to take the car.

76
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,790
- We'll be back in a couple of hours.
- Where you going?

77
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:28,270
Turns out that maybe there's one member of the club who can help us.

78
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:29,660
Who?

79
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:32,260
Pope?

80
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:35,120
just a minute.

81
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:39,020
HenrY.

82
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:43,640
What are you doing here?

83
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:46,040
Aside from jumping bail and evading the authorities?

84
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:49,530
There's something that you need to hear,but,first,I need to know if you'll listen.

85
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:51,890
I can assure you,sara,we've got nothing to discuss.

86
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:54,720
Sir,please.I need five minutes.
After that,if you want us to,we'll leave.

87
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:56,740

- Good.

92
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:39,110
Because that's not why we're here.

93
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:42,640
What the hell are you thinking about,waltzing in here?
You're a wanted criminal!

94
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:45,310
In case you've forgotten,I dedicated my career--

95
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:48,790
my entire life--
to keeping people like you behind bars.

96
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:51,460
You're talking about guilty people.
My brother is innocent.

97
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,470
And we may have the evidence to prove it.

98
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:54,960
Well,I don't care; I want you out of here.

99
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:59,150
It's in a lockbox at the corona del oro club,and you're a member.

100
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,460
Out!

101
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:01,910
Henry,please listen.

102
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:05,160
Sara,I'm tempted to say you should have known better.

103
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,030
But after what you did...

104
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:09,680
my father was looking into the burrows case when he was murdered.

105
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,620

They're hungry.

My girl's on the four o'clock flight.

129
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:37,730

I'm going to go over there and I'm going to talk to the lady.

You need anything?

00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:42,450
My daughter,dede,she's really sick.

149
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:45,840
She's had this kidney thing since she,she was real young.
It's mostly...

150
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,990
where is she?

151
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:48,750
She's sitting right there.

152
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:51,120
- Have you been here before?
- No.I'm from out of town.

153
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,370
Can I see your insurance card?

154
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,280
Um...
no,no.

155
00:09:56,280 --> 00:10:00,240
I don't have any insurance.
After I left the army,they discontinued my insurance.

156
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,800
Are you a resident of hennepin county?

157
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,800
Like I said,we're from out of town.

158
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,780
You have a driver's license?

159
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:11,760
Look,I don't have a driver's license,an insurance card,

160
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,870
or anything like that,but I do know the law.
You have to see my little girl.

00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:19,580
- Let me go get my supervisor.
- Good.

00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:26,970
I don't give a rat's ass about you or your brother.

163
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:31,330
I trusted you,I took you under my wing,I treated you like my own son.

00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:32,950
I believed you!

165
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:36,420
Day after day,you lied to me.
What kind of a man does that?

166
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,180
- A desperate one.
- Yeah.

167
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:42,140
Well...

168
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:45,730
you two made a big mistake coming here today.

169
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:47,660
You give me no choice.

170
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:50,220
I'm going to notify the authorities right now.

171
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,140
I'm sorry...

172
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:57,180
but I can't let you do that.

173
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:03,430
I don't want to hurt you,henry.

174
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:05,390
Said by the man with the gun.

175
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:07,610
If it's the only way I can convince you,so be it.

176
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:09,910
Well,you're not going to convince me by doing that.

177
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:11,440
I'm not the man you think I am.

178
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,880
Yeah,well,I have a pretty good idea who you are,michael.

179
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:17,160
If that's true,then you already know I never wanted to be in fox river.

180
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,180
I ner wanted to meet you,henry.

181
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:21,280
- I certainly didn't want to ruin your life.
- Yeah.

182
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:23,030
Well,you've done a pretty damn good job.

183
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:26,290
You're not saying anything to him I haven't said myself,henry.

184
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:29,190
I've looked into this.
What he's saying to you is absolutely true.

185
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:32,540
I just want my brother's life back.
I want people to know the truth.

186
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:35,190
I'd give anything for that.
I'd lay down my life.

187
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:38,310
Well,that's easy for you to say,standing on that side of the gun.

188
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:45,960
What if I'm standing on this side?

189
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:53,080
There are places that can better serve your needs.

190
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,650
Look,I know my rights,okay?

191
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:56,620
This isn't a primary care facility.

192
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:58,930
We provide necessary care in life-threatening situations.

193
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:02,350
Look,I know what this i are you going to wait until she's dead before you give her some help?

194
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:04,750
- Is that what you're telling me?!
- I'm not going to argue with you,sir.

195
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:07,690
This is a hospital,not a homeless shelter.

196
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:09,150
A what?

197
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,600
What did you just say to me?

198
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:18,050
I can't believe you people.

199
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:21,790
Come on.
The line is a little bit too long,okay?

200
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:25,490
We'll go somewhere else.

201
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:29,440
Where are we going?

202
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:32,600
We got to find another doctor,sweetie.

203
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,290
Oh,my god.

204
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,560
Let's go.

205
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,760
Move!

206
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:50,870
Come on,baby.

207
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,750
Franklin!

208
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:07,140
Move out of the way!

209
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:11,360
Fbi!
Stop!

210
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,400
Stop!

211
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,530
Okay.
Okay.

212
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:16,950
Okay,okay.

213
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:19,150
All right.

214
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:22,420
Just one second,baby.
Baby,you got to get down,okay?

215
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:23,820
- No!
- No,no,sweetie,you got to get dowN.

216
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:26,430
- You got to let him go,honey.
- Get down.Get down.

217
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:27,280
Honey,you got to let him go.

218
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,690
- Come on
- No.

219
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:32,160
Man,she's not letting go.

220
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,500
Don't let her pay for your mistakes.

221
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:37,560
you hear me?



1
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:55,140
I could shoot you right now and not even think twice.

2
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:56,770
But you won'T.

3
00:13:56,830 --> 00:14:00,650
You spent too much time around prisons to throw your life away like that.

4
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,240
What the hell are you trying to pull?

5
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,010
It's simple--

6
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:05,160
that's the key to an innocent man's freedom.

7
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:06,650
Come on, henry.

8
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:08,510
We both know there's something going on here.

9
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,100
Too many people have died.

10
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:14,730
Look me in the eye, tell me you don't believe there's a cover-up going on right now.

11
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:17,840
I've got no moral obligations here, michael.

12
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,140
As far as I know, lincoln is as guilty as hell.

13
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,060
Then take a ten-minute drive with me, and we'll find out.

14
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:26,650
That's all I ask.

15
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:27,980
Henry, you've looked into this before.

16
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,750
You've thought about it.

17
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:31,500
I have.

18
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:35,020
And I've come to one conclusion--

19
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:38,200
this has nothing to do with me.

20
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:40,390
But I am a man of the law, and right now,

21
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:44,360
I've got a convicted felon standing inside my house.

22
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:48,590
Well, maybe there's something I can offer you to make you change your mind.

23
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,570
what do you intend to do with us?

24
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,730
You grease monkey.

25
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:31,740
You don't deserve minimum wage.

26
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:34,220
The hell i don't, working graveyard.

27
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:37,780
There ain't no man deserve more pennies on a dollar per hour

28
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,660
than they got iq points in their head.

29
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,330
I ain't stupid.

30
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:44,590
Seems equal stupid as the rest of you.

31
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:49,080
Seems to run in the genes.

32
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,620
Teddy.

33
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,820
Ten symonyms.

34
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,740
Pick a word.

35
00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:58,030
Pick a word.

36
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:01,570
Destroy.

37
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:07,690
Ten synonyms for "destroy.

38
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:14,930
" Annul.

39
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:19,900
Mutilate.

40
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:25,070
Liquidate. Abrogate. Quell.

41
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:29,270
Ravage. Expunge. Demolish.

42
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:32,620
Extirpate. Extinguish.

43
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,540
Whoo, you see that?

44
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:38,030
Stupid, my pail, my boy's gonna be president.

45
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,830
how come you ain't studying?

46
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:08,650
'Cause I'm tired.

47
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:11,470
'Cause I feel like a circus freak.

48
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:18,450
Well...

49
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:25,440
now... it's in your own best interest.

50
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:30,260
Don't you understand that? Hmm?

51
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:40,630
Now, you're going to be president someday.

52
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,550
You mark my words.

53
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:52,380
Susan: Theodore.

54
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,160
Theodore, do you hear me?

55
00:18:57,210 --> 00:18:59,170
What are you going to do with us?

56
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:19,320
We're gonna put down some roots.

57
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:24,000
You wanted me dead, paul.

58
00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:26,340
Just following orders.

59
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:30,390
Sent me to the chair for something I didn't do, all for your president.

60
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,010
You were willing to do that.

61
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:35,550
Just... following... orders.

62
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:37,370
Steadman said you loved her.

63
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:40,140
Steadman was a deranged man that lived in a locked box.

64
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:43,110
You don't love someone that loves power more than life.

65
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:44,880
Bitter, huh?

66
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:46,510
Am I?

67
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:51,720
No offense, but you're not capable of understanding the relationship.

68
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:02,510
Okay, any way you look at it, there is no light at the end of this tunnel.

69
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:05,640
One way or another, you and I, we die.

70
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:07,170
Your brother, too.

71
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:10,040
Which is a shame given all he's done for you.

72
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:13,050
I have a sister I haven't talked to in 15 years.

73
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:14,960
Think she's better off for it?

74
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,690
We'll make it.

75
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:17,980
What is that, faith?

76
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,570
Yeah, that's faith.

77
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:21,380
All I see is a black hole.

78
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:25,880
And sooner or later, they are going to suck each one of us into it.

79
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:31,990
But when they come for me, I'm going to take as many of them with me as I can.

80
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:36,770
She must have really broken your heart, paul.

81
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,990
president reynolds attended a chicago fundraiser last night

82
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:44,660
as part of her two-day stop in the windy city.

83
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:47,690
Reynolds' popularity continues to soar in the midwest with

84
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:51,120
appearances scheduled in indianapolis, detroit and flint,

85
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:52,800
michigan later in the week.

86
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:54,430
At a democratic fundraiser...

87
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:57,250
Mr. Kim... sarah tancredi surfaced in chicago.

88
00:20:57,300 --> 00:21:00,390
She was spotted at the corona de oro club about an hour ago.

89
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,780
Corona de oro club?

90
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:02,880
It's a cigar club.

91
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:04,750
Her father was a member.

92
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,010
He kept a private humidor there.

93
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:13,980
Get me a jet to chicago.

94
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:22,640
hey,i got to,yh ,split.

95

101
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:47,910
May****guy.

102
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,510
He's here

103
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:59,450
tell me you're not still thinking he's going to show.

104
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:01,560
He's let you down so many times.

105
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:03,000
You know that.

106
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:04,570
Yeah, well, maybe it's the baby in me

107
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:07,110
that's telling me that this time it's going to be different.

108
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:11,400
I don't mean to burst your bubble, but he's not going to show.

109
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:19,380
Bubble's not burst.

110
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:22,680
I got three words for you.

111
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:24,130
Yeah?

112
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:26,070
We gotta run.

113
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:28,090
Good seeing you, theresa!

114
00:22:51,090 --> 00:22:52,190
I'm so glad you came.

115
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,820
You're crazy.

116
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:56,550
How did they know?



1
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:16,140
You're certain...

2
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:18,360
about what's in the box?

3
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:21,660
No,but it's all we've got.

4
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:25,010
Thank you,henry.

5
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,660
You sure about this?

6
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:42,900
No.

7
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:45,520
Either way,you still owe me dinner.

8
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,520
Is that so?

9
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,250
Yeah.

10
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:54,880
First week in fox river,you promised me,if you ever got out of there,you'd take me to dinner.

11
00:23:55,450 --> 00:24:00,490
Well,maybe,after we wrap this up,we can stop off and get you a burrito on the way back to pope's house.

12
00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:04,790
Scofield,I don't know what you're used to,but anything short of a filet mignon is not going to cut it with me.

13
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:10,020
It's a date.

14
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:28,040
Hey.

15
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:30,310
- How did you pull that off?
- I'll tell you later.

17
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:32,140
- Is he in yet?
- Yep.

19
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:36,760
This shouldn't take more than a couple of minutes.
Any longer than that,we'll know we've got trouble.

21
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:40,400
This way.

22
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,830
Thank you.

23
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:46,600
Mr. Pope.

24
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,160
Hey,warren how's it going?

25
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:51,190
Did you hear what happened this morning?
Sara tancredi came in.

27
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:53,180
Yeah.
So I heard.

29
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:56,590
Next time,don't let her get away.

30
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:58,610
Thanks.

31
00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:57,750
Excuse me,do you mind if I borrow your computer for a moment?

32
00:25:57,750 --> 00:26:00,110
- No problem.
- Thanks.

34
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:14,090
pitch in,chitlins!

35
00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:17,030
We can't do this.
We can't live herE.

37
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:19,820
No,of course not like this.
We gonna clean.

39
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:22,410
We are cleaning!
We gonna rebuild!

41
00:26:22,410 --> 00:26:25,560
You can't do this to them.
Look at them.

43
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:33,840
Y'all mind coming along here for a minute.

44
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:39,480
Come on.
I think we're past me waving that gun around,don't you think?

46
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:43,190
Come on.
Thank you.

48
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:45,890
- What are you doing?
- Nothing is gonna happen to them.

50
00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:46,830
Susan.

51
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:48,220
Susie Q.

52
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:53,180
Do you think I'd bring you here to so sacred a place to me as this if I meant you ill?

53
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:55,390
Look at me!

54
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:00,890
I am not the animal you think you see before you.

55
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:06,360
I am the laws of karma all come down wrong.

56
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:09,280
- Don't you understand?
- I don'T.

58
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:16,640
What I'm trying to say is that...

59
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:20,500
I am the sin of my father.

60
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:26,770
- Why are you telling me this?
- Because I love you.

62
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:31,230
Because I want you to understand me.

63
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:34,520
I am the last in the line of bagwells.

64
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:37,540
The tail end of a corrupted breed.

65
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:42,390
The earth,thank god,shall see no more of our generations.

66
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:57,730
I cannot procreate,susan.

67
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:03,400
And yet,there's something in that that gives me great hope.

68
00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:06,060
No more bagwells shall roam this planet.

69
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:08,430
Not with that vile blood in their veins.

70
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:12,170
All I want to do is end the bloodline,extirpate it,

71
00:28:12,410 --> 00:28:14,060
and start another,

72
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:15,900
afresh.

73
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:18,040
- A new family.
- Oh,teddy.

75
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:21,060
Those children are my salvation,my chance to make this world a better place.

76
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:24,280
my chance to make this world a better place.

77
00:28:28,130 --> 00:28:30,510
I will be good,susan.

78
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:33,100
I will love them.
I will love you.

80
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:36,960
I will take communion,be baptized under a truer light.

81
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:44,350
All I ask is that you love me back,just a little.

82
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:48,790
Or learn to do so in time.

83
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,780
Can you do that,susan?

84
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:02,940
I can'T.

85
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:07,160
I can'T.

86
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,600
I'm sorry.

87
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:28,360
Teddy.

88
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:30,480
teddy.

89
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:33,240
- Mommy.
- Please,please.

91
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:36,430
teddy,it's okay,it's okay.

92
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:42,490
teddY.

93
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:47,420
Teddy,please.Teddy

94
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,630
teddy,I'm sorry.

95
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:55,600
I can do it.
I can love you.

97
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,350
Where are we?

98
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:17,310
: At the doctor's office,sweetie.

99
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:20,580
Hello.

100
00:30:20,650 --> 00:30:23,140
Hello,I have an emergency in here.

101
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:26,690
Hello?

102
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:38,000
Hello.

103
00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:43,870
Hey,you the doctor?

104
00:30:43,870 --> 00:30:45,420
- Need to wait your turn.
- No,it is my turn.

106
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:47,120
This is an emergency right here.

107
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,150
I need you to look at my daughter,okay?

108
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:51,440
She's not feeling too good.

109
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:53,940
Please.

110
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:59,310
Sweetie,hold on,so I can...

111
00:31:00,490 --> 00:31:03,670
all right,look,this is all the money I got,okay?

112
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:05,910
That's $400.

113
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:12,930
Please look at my daughter.

114
00:31:13,770 --> 00:31:15,510
What's the matter with her?

115
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:17,490
She has a kidney disease--

116
00:31:17,490 --> 00:31:19,050
pkd.

117
00:31:19,050 --> 00:31:22,190
Normally,we have it under control,but I don't like what I'm seeing right now.

118
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:25,540
Her stomach hurts,okay?
And she's always hot.

120
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:27,430
How's her appetite?
It's gone.

122
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:30,130
She's always tired,ain't that right,baby?

123
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:31,960
All right.

124
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:34,910
Hop up here.

125
00:31:34,910 --> 00:31:37,220
Thank you.

126
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:42,080
Okay.
He just wants to take a good look at you,okay?

128
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:45,620
- May need to run a few tests.
- Just do what you have to do,man.

130
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:49,880
I'm gonna be right here,okay,baby?

131
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:52,330
Okay.

132
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:59,240
- Yeah.
- What's going on now?

134
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,880
Still in there.

135
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,270
This is taking too long.

136
00:32:03,610 --> 00:32:05,150
Wait,wait,wait.

137
00:32:05,150 --> 00:32:07,230
Here he comes.

138
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:15,160
- What's happening?
- We got company.

140
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:18,650
Hello,henry.

141
00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:26,050
I didn't know you were a cigar man.

142
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:28,230
Who are you?

143
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:29,590
Uh,a friend.

144
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:31,840
A colleague,in fact.
We're both in law enforcement.

146
00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:34,470
I'm not anymore.

147
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:38,170
That's right.
You're,uh,retired.

149
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:42,410
- Know the guy?
- Yeah.

151
00:32:44,970 --> 00:32:47,150
Looks like the lifestyle's treating you well.
Yeah?

153
00:32:47,150 --> 00:32:49,660
Socializing over cubans and cognac?

154
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:55,530
But that's not what you were doing,is it?

155
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,890
Henry.

156
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:03,730
- You don't mind if ask you to empty your pockets?
- As a matter of fact,I do.

158
00:33:03,730 --> 00:33:06,450
I'm not going to play any games with you.

159
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:09,800
We both know why you came here today.

160
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:14,320
I suggest you get out of my way,young man.

161
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:20,080
I can't do that.



1
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:28,420
Unless you'd like to cause serious trouble for yourself and your family,

2
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:31,860
Iadvise you to hand over whatever it is you found.

3
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:35,900
Now.

4
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,630
Michael?

5
00:33:54,330 --> 00:33:56,390
get in!

6
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:15,780
let's go!

7
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:18,460
Linc!

8
00:34:28,330 --> 00:34:30,590
sara!

9
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:59,660
whoa,whoa,it's okayit's okay. Easy,easy,it's okay,it's okay.

10
00:35:01,290 --> 00:35:03,890
ma'am,are you all right?

11
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,060
I don't understand.

12
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:07,410
We got a call.

13
00:35:07,450 --> 00:35:10,720
Someone said there's a hostage situation here.

14
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:15,060
No one knew we were here.

15
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:36,550
are you okay?

16
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:38,520
Okay.

17
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:40,470
Hey,so what's going on?

18
00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:43,950
I'm afraid your daughter shows signs of renal failure.

19
00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:46,330
She ever had hemodialysis?

20
00:35:46,370 --> 00:35:48,900
No,hemo... no.

21
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:52,580
No,this has never really gone that far.

22
00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:57,340
What,are you planning on doing it right here?

23
00:35:57,390 --> 00:36:00,460
Were not set up for it. And neither is she.

24
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:04,850
But there is a county dialysis clinic a few blocks away.

25
00:36:04,890 --> 00:36:11,690
But we're gonna have to place a catheter in her neck so she can be examined.

26
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,660
Hold on,sweetie,this is gonna be a little cold.

27
00:36:14,730 --> 00:36:17,210
It's okay,baby.

28
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,520
Whoa,whoa,wait,wait,wait. Wait,what,what is that?

29
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:29,910
It's a trocar. It's used for placing the catheter.

30
00:36:29,950 --> 00:36:32,260
I got her.

31
00:36:37,210 --> 00:36:39,430
Do we really have to go this far?

32
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:41,370
Look.

33
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:44,810
I'm doing the best I can here,but you got to understand something.

34
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,300
Your daughter is sick.

35
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:49,570
Now,this may look like a desperate measure because it is.

36
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:57,710
This is gonna hurt a little bit.

37
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:00,610
Stop! Stop.

38
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:03,500
Come on,baby.

39
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:07,560
Come with me. I can't do this.

40
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,320
What's going on?

41
00:37:28,410 --> 00:37:30,980
I made a deal with pope.

42
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:37,930
You made a deal with pope? What kind of deal?

43
00:37:37,970 --> 00:37:42,420
If he came with us and if we got what we needed,

44
00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:44,170
I said I'd turn myself in.

45
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,620
What?

46
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:47,500
We don't even know what this thing is!

47
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:49,710
It could be nothing,michael.

48
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:50,950
You know about this?

49
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:53,010
Not until it came out of his mouth.

50
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:55,060
It's the only thing I could think of.

51
00:37:55,090 --> 00:37:57,730
You two can still finish this.

52
00:37:57,770 --> 00:37:59,820
You'll just have to do it without me.

53
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:01,690
- I'm not gonna let you do this,michael.
- Just...

54
00:38:01,730 --> 00:38:04,290
there's no coming back from this.

55
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:08,010
Hold on.

56
00:38:08,050 --> 00:38:08,910
What's the holdup?

57
00:38:08,990 --> 00:38:14,720
Your brother's right. I wouldn't count on the courts to show you any leniency in this.

58
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:19,470
That doesn't matter. I said I'd hold up my end of the deal.

59
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:22,470
You already did.

60
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,830
I listened to this.

61
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:27,120
You have something here.

62
00:38:27,170 --> 00:38:30,830
There's gonna be a lot of people who wish you didn't,but you do.

63
00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:33,320
- Listen,henry...
- I'd go now if I were you.

64
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:36,020
And don't consider this forgiveness.

65
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:40,330
In fact,I'm about ten seconds away from changing my mind.

66
00:38:41,010 --> 00:38:43,640
Thank you.

67
00:38:58,730 --> 00:39:01,320
okay...

68
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:06,320
here,listen...

69
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:11,320
let's tuck you in,all right?

70
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:17,130
come on. Let's go.

71
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:30,160
let's just... let's just sit for a bit longer,okay?

72
00:39:31,690 --> 00:39:35,730
We're gonna go in a little bit,okay?

73
00:39:52,830 --> 00:39:56,400
you know daddy loves you with all his heart,right?

74
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:59,170
I love you so much.

75
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:02,330
I'm so sorry.

76
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:06,880
I'm so sorry,baby.

77
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:25,350
Yeah.

78
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,600
Got a call for you.

79
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:29,160
I'll call back. I just heard from some clinic up north.

80
00:40:29,210 --> 00:40:31,610
They had contact with franklin a half an hour ago.

81
00:40:31,650 --> 00:40:33,410
I think you want to take this.

82
00:40:34,490 --> 00:40:37,280
Put it through.

83
00:40:37,990 --> 00:40:39,760
yeah? Mahone.

84
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,430
Is this the man in charge?

85
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:43,000
Oh,yeah.

86
00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:44,800
My name...

87
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:51,250
is benjamin miles franklin.

88
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:54,200
And I want to turn myself in.

89
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:56,120
But I got one condition.

90
00:40:56,170 --> 00:40:59,290
My wife,she goes free.

91
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:03,080
My little daughter,she needs her mother.

92
00:41:03,090 --> 00:41:07,020
I don't think I need to make a deal with you,Mr. Franklin.

93
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:12,810
And what if I got something you need?

94
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:53,130
your wife was released an hour ago.

95
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:54,910
She'll be here soon.

96
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:58,950
You promise me that she will be okay.

97
00:42:04,250 --> 00:42:08,340
Just hold up your end of the deal.

98
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:11,910
I will.

99
00:42:13,490 --> 00:42:18,060
I'll get you scofield.

100
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:23,650
Come on.

101
00:42:36,850 --> 00:42:39,420
here we go.

102
00:42:44,490 --> 00:42:47,400
You think it's a conversation?

103
00:42:47,470 --> 00:42:50,680
One they don't want us hear.

104
00:42:51,530 --> 00:42:52,710
You ready?

105
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:55,370
Let's do it.

106
00:42:55,540 --> 00:43:03,290


107
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


108
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
