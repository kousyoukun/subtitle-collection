1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,250
Previously on prison break:

2
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:03,810
I got nothing against you,kid.

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:04,970
What are you doing,man?

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,280
But they do.

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:14,180
Your pal manche told me all about your little treasure hunt for westmoreland's stash.

6
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,980
We're going to utah.

7
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:17,390
Fooled you.

8
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:19,470
Hands behind your back.

9
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:21,530
Make yourself at home.
Sure.

10
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:27,750
Your father got a call from the white house.

11
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:29,140
They withdrew his nomination.

12
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,170
According to them,his confirmation  was going to be a problem.

13
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:34,260
My father is not a suicidal man.

14
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:36,410
Governor tancredi,not part of our plan.

15
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,630
Anyone who knows anything  has got to be dealt with.

16
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:40,410
If someone's a liability,they go.

17
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:42,120
Tancredi was becoming  a liability.

18
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:43,540
So was his daughter.

19
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:45,190
Wait,what?

20
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:51,960
Burrows is scheduled to be released from the klipton detention center in kingman,arizona tomorrow morning.

21
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:54,820
Lj is out there; I'm going to get him.

22
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:57,260
Take care.

23
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:01,030
Charles westmoreland...

24
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,950
god bless you and your wrinkled old sack.

25
00:01:04,990 --> 00:01:06,240
it's all here.

26
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:07,600
Where's sucre?

27
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:09,340
Drop the bag.

28
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:11,640
No one's going anywhere.

29
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:24,020
What the hell are you doing,man?

30
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:25,190
Sucre...

31
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:28,440
whatever it is you want...
I want the money,all of it.

32
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:30,480
What,are you robbing us?

33
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:32,060
The money was never yours to begin with.

34
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,000
This is about business.

35
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:36,560
$5 million worth of business.

36
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:39,510
So this is how it's going to go down,huh?

37
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:41,710
After everything.

38
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:45,220
Once a thief,always a thief.

39
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:47,530
You just figuring that out?

40
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,710
The backpack.

41
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:52,000
Now!

42
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,900
Don't do this,buddy.

43
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:00,960
Yo,take a look around you,papi.

44
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:05,700
It's three of us,it's one of you; you are outnumbered,man,and we will come after you.

45
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,190
It'll be the last thing you do,my brother.

46
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:08,930
What,are you going to shoot at all of us?

47
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,460
Probably not.

48
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:15,820
but I will get two.

49
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,260
Now...

50
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:19,720
which two is it going to be?

51
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:24,100
That's what I thought.

52
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:26,080
Adios,amigos.

53
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:35,530
I don't believe this.

54
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:39,420
We have come all this way and done all of this work.

55
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:42,710
Thought you was compadres,tattoo?

56
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:46,820
so what are we going to do now,man?

57
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,500
The police are going to be here any second.

58
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:52,970
Ain't no way I'm letting that-that dunderpate ride off with five...

59
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:55,030
It's your choice.

60
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,780
It's all right.

61
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:13,600
all right,I'm going to give you this,and,uh...

62
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:16,950
you should be able to cut yourself free in about an hour.

63
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,520
So what's the plan,man?

64
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,980
Well,you can do what you want.

65
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:24,560
I let that psychopath t-bag loose once.

66
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:26,380
I'm not going to do it again.

67
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:29,900
Make a nice little present for the police when they get here.

68
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:37,200
Where is he?

69
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:46,300
I don't know,man,look,I got to,I got to go.

70
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:48,350
Uh,good luck.

71
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:01,940
They're going to get you.

72
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:20,050
Ms.Tancredi.

73
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:21,240
I didn't mean to startle you.

74
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:22,950
What the hell are you doing in my house?

75
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:24,080
No reason to be frightened.

76
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,060
I used to work with your father.

77
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:31,250
I'm so sorry for your loss.

78
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:41,920
My father didn't commit suicide.

79
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:45,540
What are you doing?

80
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:48,000
Making sure it doesn't look like I did!

81
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:53,890
People will ask questions if the day the governor was found killing himself,his daughter is found dead in what looks like a struggle.

82
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,610
Well,then.

83
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:00,880
What if they don't find her?

84
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,870
In an apparent attempt to avoid jail time,

85
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:08,140
the governor's daughter skips bail and disappears.

86
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,770
We're talking about your last minutes,ms.Tancredi.

87
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,070
Please don't do this.

88
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,920
That stuff on that table is premium.

89
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:15,470
It's grade "A.

90
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:17,940
" Do yourself a favor,go out on a high.

91
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,490
Look,I'm begging you here.

92
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,740
One last ride.

93
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:26,060
oh,god!

94
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:26,850
adios,amigos,huh?

95
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:31,350
What?

96
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:32,810
Too much?

97
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:35,300
You were great.

98
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,240
this thing is freaking heavy,dude.

99
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:42,820
Won't be so bad after we split it up.

100
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:46,770
Three ways: Me,you and linc.
Four.

101
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,600
We're going to send a share to charles's daughter,with her father's love,just like we promised.

102
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,100
What about c-note?

103
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,860
I feel kind of bad about the whole thing.

104
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,410
There's no way to know if we could trust him.

105
00:06:56,430 --> 00:07:01,310
Once we get down to panama,we'll send something up to his family,make sure he's taken care of.

106
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:03,930
Five million dollars.

107
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:06,590
I can't believe I'm going to be...

108
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,310
where the hell is the money?

109
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:16,380
Where the hell is the money?

110
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,800
the backpack...

111
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:46,540

Merry christmas from the state.

Here's a list of options available to you.

120
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:05,010
Places to stay,businesses that are more open to hiring men out of the correctional system.

121
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,500
Any questions you might have about your immediate future?

122
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:22,150
No.

123
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:28,600
Well,the number on there is toll-free.

124
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:31,660
If you encounter any problems,you can call there 24-7.

125
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,890
Thanks.

126
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,820
Wait a second.You know what?

127
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:39,130
Why don't you tell me where you need to go,and I'll make sure you get there.

128
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:44,830
You know,I think I'll be all right.

129
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:46,290
You sure?
Yeah.

130
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,830
Thank you.

131
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,140
Kid didn't bite.

132
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,690
He's on foot.
All right.

133
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:05,670
Have your men follow.Remember,it's the father we want.

134
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,760
We can't go back.

135
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:10,930
You said it,without the money,we're screwed.

136
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:13,240
We can'T...
just let me think.

137
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:15,240
Maybe it's still back...
just let me think!Let me think.

138
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:16,800
Maybe it's still back at the house.

139
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:20,690
The money's not back at the house unless t-bag is.

140
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:24,620
He must've switched the packs.

141
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,030
wh-what do we do...

142
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:27,740
what do we do now?

143
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:32,400
We still got the five grand we took when we pocketed the money.

144
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:36,860
It's not gonna be five million,but it might be enough to get us where we're going.

145
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:38,410
All units be advised.

146

Escaped convicts from fox river have been positively id'd at 1131 monterey lane.

147
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:46,170
We have dogs being dispatched to the location.

148
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:48,660
I want every road in or out of town blocked off.

149
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,660
I don't care if it's on wheels,rails or hooves.

150
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:53,020
I want it stopped and searched.

151
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,540
I thought you said we would have a head start.

152
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,000
It was the gunshot,buddy.

153
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:00,060
One of the neighbors must've heard.

154
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,670
How fast can that thing go?

155
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:04,770
I don't know.Both of us,it could probably...

156
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:11,020
we're never gonna get out of here on the roads.

157
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:13,880
We need to find another way.

158

chicago,illinois

159

He's in your office.

160
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,170
Who let him in?

161
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:24,800
I can't believe they're calling me back here when my escapees are out there.

162
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:26,390
I want to know who this guy is.

163
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:28,660
Said his name was sullins.

164
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:31,920
Son of a bitch.

165
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:35,360
Let me know if anything breaks on the convicts.

166
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:40,880
Alex.
Thanks for coming in.

167
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:44,730
You want to tell me why internal affairs is pulling me out of the field in the middle of a manhunt?

168
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:47,420
It's been a while since we've had a sit-down,hasn't it?

169
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:49,260
Not since the shales escape,am I right?

170
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:50,890
Yeah,yeah.What's going on,richard?

171
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,030
Well...

172
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:54,880
that's precisely what I'm here to find out.

173
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,760
And you're not getting out of here until I do.

174
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:06,190
lyman,wyoming

175
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:10,500
Oh,my god.Civilization.

176
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:25,790
What can I get for you boys?

177
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:28,620
You tell me.

178
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:30,020
Two waters,then.

179
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:33,350
And the use of your phone,if you'd be so kind.

180
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:36,700
Don't worry,it's a local call.

181
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:42,370
First thing I do,we get home: Clean underwear.

182
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,300
Then what?

183
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:47,600
I guess go back to that liquor store,beg for my job back.

184
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:52,450
We had it.

185
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:54,440
We were so close.

186
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,770
I can still taste that money right there in the back of my throat.

187
00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:05,760
Well,nothing that a couple of keystones,a hungry man salisbury steak dinner and a night in front of the tv won't take care of.

188
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:11,010
Hey,mom,it's brad.

189
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:15,460
Hey,listen,me and roy,we ran into some car trouble and...

190
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:18,060
we were wondering if you could come pick us up.

191
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:19,710
I don't know,hold on.

192
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:21,460
What the hell town is this?

193
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:23,780
Thought you said this was a local call.

194
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:26,660
Hey,bradley,check this out.
Wait,mom.

195
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,970
These individuals were reportedly the prisoners

196
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:34,140
who escaped from the fox river penitentiary in illinois just a couple of days ago.

197
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,990
What were they doing all the way out here in tooele,utah?

198
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:41,480
Well,jeanette owens,whose garage they dug up,has her own theory.

199
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:47,390
They pretended that they were some kind of workers from the power company,

200
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:52,670
and that they had made a mistake and they'd have to do some digging.

201
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:57,650
Hey,mom,on second thought,uh,can you wire us some extra scratch?

202
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,760
Turns out,we ain't done yet.

203
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:16,710
hello.

204
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:18,370
Bruce,I need your help.

205
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:19,060
Sara?

206
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,910
Bruce,my father didn't commit suicide,okay?

207
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:23,840
Okay,just calm down.Where are you?

208
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:27,870
He was looking into the burrows case and I think that he found something that they didn't want him to know.

209
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:30,210
And now,I think that they think that I know it,too.

210
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:31,720
All right,I want you to listen to me.

211
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:33,250
I'm gonna send someone over to pick you up.

212
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:36,390
I'll bring you back here,and we'll sort all of this out,I promise.

213
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:37,980
Just tell me where you are.

214
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,410
Uh,I don't know,I'm at a pay phone on...

215
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,160
third and harper.

216
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:45,100
Do you have your cell in case I need to reach you?

217
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,810
Uh,I do,but I-I thought it would be tapped.

218
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:48,460
I don't know.

219
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,680
All right,someone's on their way.

220
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,880
Just stay right where you are.

221
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:53,450
Thank you.

222
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,750
I'll give you 80 bucks  for them.

223
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:07,750
Come on,man,they're worth...

224
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:10,560
worth a lot more to the person they actually belong to.

225
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:13,150
These are ladies clubs,doctor.

226
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:16,110
I'm guessing they're hotter than a monkey's jockstrap.

227
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,060
80 bucks.

228
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:24,370
Throw in the cooler,and you got a deal.

229
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:31,030
We got to lose the bike.

230
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:31,860
No way.

231
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,040
The roads are sealed.

232
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:34,300
It's the only way we're gonna make it out of here.

233
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:35,730
I can't,bro.I promised petey...

234
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:38,250
you're not getting that thing across the river.

235
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:41,890
And every minute we spend trying is a minute we don't have,okay?

236
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:43,550
I'm sorry.

237
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,550
We got to move.

238
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:57,640
I've heard about these kinds of places.

239
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:59,530
They got leeches,you know.

240
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:02,830
I'll take the leeches in here over the handcuffs back there.

241
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:04,350
I don't know,papi.

242
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:06,770
Sort of depends on where the leech leeches,you know what I'm saying?

243
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,270
Stop kidding around.

244
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:23,260
are you all right,buddy?

245
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,750
I can'T...i can't move!

246
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:28,130
You feel like you broke anything?

247
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:29,400
No,I don't think so.

248
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:31,700
Can you get it?Can you get it off me?

249
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,600
This thing's not going anywhere.

250
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:43,610
I'm gonna check your foot.

251
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:01,380
I'm sorry,buddy.

252
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:03,120
It's stuck.

253
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:42,380
you,call 911.

254
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:48,710
Kelli,my name is sara.I'm a doctor.

255
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,860
You're gonna be okay.Can you hear me?

256
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,830
You'll be all right.Take some deep breaths and...

257
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:58,760
kelli?

258
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:00,580
Kelli.

259
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:10,960
It's gonna be okay,right?

260
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:14,800
I mean,if you can get eight people out of prison,

261
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:17,980
you can get my puerto rican ass out of this,right?

262
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:20,900
Can't you?

263
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,290
come on!

264
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,060
damn it!

265
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,580
Do you hear that?

266
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:51,670
I know that sound.

267
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:53,690
There's a dam up river.

268
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,960
It's a signal.

269
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:00,390
It means they're opening the locks.

270
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:05,180
That means the water level's gonna rise,and when it does,the log will just float right off.

271
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,490
Yeah?

272
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:11,540
Canine units at the scene have multiple scents and are spreading out into the field.

273
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:13,980
Trail's fresh.These guys can't have gotten very far.

274
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:17,920
there were six cons back at that house.

275
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:20,420
They'll be tracking us in every direction.

276
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:25,740
It'll take an hour just to make it over this far,and by that time,the water level will rise,we'll be long gone.

277
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,490
Are you sure?

278
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,160
Yeah,I'm sure.

279
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:34,410
I'm sure.

280
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:38,620
Ask any of the 20 cops there,john abruzzi was armed.

281
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:39,800
John abruzzi drew his weapon...

282
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:41,890
he never should have been allowed to get that far.

283
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:43,120
Richard,let's be clear.

284
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,560
If you knew how things needed to be handled in a manhunt,

285
00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:50,480
you'd be out there running one instead of hamstringing the men that are.

286
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:57,450
The fbi's primary objective in investigating fugitive matters is to affect the swift location and capture of the fugitives.

287
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:59,320
You have two dead bodies,alex.

288
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:01,350
I've got two dead felons,richard.

289
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:03,970
Now,maybe that doesn't play well from a public relations standpoint,

290
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:08,820
but from a public safety standpoint,abruzzi and apolskis were by the book.

291
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:12,910
Shooting of an unarmed kid at point-blank range is by the book?

292
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:14,640
Come on.

293
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:18,310
Incident report,david "tweener" apolskis.

294
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:22,730
You know,I'm curious,was he cuffed during transport?

295
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:26,160
Says in here he somehow managed to grab your primary weapon.

296
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:28,700
You carry that in a shoulder holster?
Hip.

297
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,940
Left,right?Right,left?

298
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,660
Left.
Left.

299
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:37,540
I'm sorry,I get confused sometimes.

300
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:43,880
So just so I've got this right,you were driving along alone with a cuffed prisoner,

301
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:49,190
and somehow he reaches forward across your chest and grabs your weapon.

302
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:54,270
It's too bad you didn't react that quickly with apolskis.

303
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:57,190
Maybe he'd still be alive.

304
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:38,750
there's a plan to make all of this right

305
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:41,300
What does an origami bird  have to do with any of this?

306
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,770
Michael scofield sent it to her.

307
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:48,660
And since your brilliant plan to eliminate sara tancredi from the equation failed so completely--

308
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:53,380
I wouldn't say it failed completely at all.
There's a dead woman in a phone booth.

309
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:56,370
Civilian.

310
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:59,580
A certain number of bodies you can sweep under the rug.

311
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:03,530
President's rug is getting so full,you can hardly stand on it.

312
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:06,600
So what do you suggest we should do?

313
00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:10,390
You ever go fishing,bill?
Just make your point.

314
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:11,540
There's two ways to catch a fish.

315
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:14,860
You cast out a big net and hope you get what you're looking for.

316
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:19,150
Or you choose the right bait and guarantee that you do.

317
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:21,310
It's a simple strategy,plays across the board.

318
00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:23,420
Lj will lead us to burrows.

319
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:25,350
Sara will lead us to scofield.

320
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:27,160
And how do you intend to follow sara,

321
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:32,360
when the only lead you've got is an origami bird with an out of service phone number?

322
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,990
Maybe it's not a phone number.

323
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:52,050
what do you have?

324
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,560
Junior's on the move,but still no sign of burrows.

325
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:57,680
Sir,the guy's in hiding,maybe he doesn't even know his kid's out.

326
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:05,400
The cop that was held hostage in utah has burrows splitting off from the rest of the group just after word of lj's release hit the wire.

327
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:06,480
He knows.

328
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:12,830
Now if we want to know for sure if he's there,we need to do something to draw him out.

329
00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:31,230
Hey,you mind sparing some change?

330
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,280
No.

331
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:33,660
Come on.

332
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,800
No,I'm all tapped out.
You got something.

333
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:37,130
I'll take whatever you got.

334
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:41,070
Look,seriously,I just got out of lock-up.

335
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,420
Sorry.

336
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:49,290
I see,you think you're better than me,huh?

337
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:50,700
I don't think I'm better than you.

338
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:53,430
Yo,where you running,little man?

339
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:55,120
I'm not running anywhere.

340
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:07,820
This isn't how  it's supposed to go.

341
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:12,950
The whole reason I went along with the break was to have a life with maricruz and my baby.

342
00:24:14,130 --> 00:24:15,480
And now what?

343
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:18,220
Get some two-bit job?

344
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:21,160
Always be looking over my shoulder?

345
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:24,630
What kind of life is that?

346
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:26,660
You can come with me and linc.

347
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,130
To panama.

348
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:29,190
Start over.

349
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:33,370
The longer you stay here,the more chance there is you'll never make it to panama.

350
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:35,460
You've got other people to think about.

351
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:38,220
Your brother,your nephew.

352
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:39,730
sara.

353
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:41,960
She's meeting you down there,isn't she?

354
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,630
I don't know.

355
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,480
We never talked about it.

356
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,450
But you're hoping.

357
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,480
Just give it a rest,will you.

358
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:49,690
The dogs are locked in.We've got two trails merging.

359
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:50,850
They were definitely here.

360
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:53,160
They've headed east towards drucker ranch.They've gone off-road.

361
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:57,870
Any additional units,we need to setup a one-mile perimeter and then start closing in.

362
00:24:58,070 --> 00:24:59,930
It's getting deeper.

363
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:07,200
So how come this freaking thing ain't moving yet?

364
00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:10,560
let me check

365
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,810
you all right?

366
00:25:23,370 --> 00:25:25,070
Hey,michael...

367
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:27,800
I understand if you have to keep going,you know.

368
00:25:27,810 --> 00:25:29,360
Don't say that.I'm not going anywhere.

369
00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:32,180
No,but,look,just think about it.
You know,if I leave you drown.

370
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,450
No,I know,but just...

371
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,540
the water level's getting higher,sucre.

372
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,340
How many seconds can you hold your breath?

373
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,480
45?60?

374
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:41,380
That's how long you've got to live if I take off.

375
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,080
How long do you have if you stay?

376
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:44,730
How long till the dogs lead the cops here?

377
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:46,210
What you're suggesting is not an option.

378
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,800
Look,I ain't trying to be a hero or nothing.

379
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:52,560
We both know there are only two things that can happen now.

380
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:56,310
Leave me here...

381
00:25:56,690 --> 00:25:59,530
or we both get caught.

382
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:17,690
bruce.

383
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:18,680
Oh,sara.

384
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:21,860
I know we said not to use this number,but I just needed to know you were okay.

385
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:25,120
My driver said he went to pick you up and the place was a crime scene.

386
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:28,580
Yeah,the woman that he saw,the woman by the pay phone,that was supposed to be me.

387
00:26:28,610 --> 00:26:31,330
And-and I had to leave her there.I didn't know what to do.

388
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:32,560
Bruce,who are these people?

389
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:34,230
They knew exactly where I was going to be standing.

390
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:37,060
They knew where I was going to be...

391
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:38,760
sara?

392
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:40,950
It was you.

393
00:26:41,050 --> 00:26:43,230
What are you talking about,sara?

394
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:45,640
I just need to know where you are.
Oh,my god.

395

city memorial hospital
emergency

396
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:15,900
Excuse me,we'd like to check on a friend of ours,lj burrows?

397
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,160
He's getting some stitches.

398
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:18,670
We just want to make sure he's all right.

399
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:20,370
And you can see him when he's through.

400
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:21,470
It's policy.

401
00:27:21,490 --> 00:27:22,600
You don't get it.

402
00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:24,220
I get that that kid defended himself.

403
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,580
You going to tell us why you attacked him in the first place?

404
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:26,540
I told you man.

405
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,290
I know,some guy paid you.
Some guy paid me to do it.

406
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,890
Excuse me.Fbi.

407
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:32,110
What do you mean somebody paid you?

408
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:33,500
What the hell does it sound like,man?

409
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:37,520
Some dude gave me 50 bucks to give the kid a beat down.

410
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:40,560
It's burrows.He's here.

411
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:48,590
How you feeling,son?

412
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:50,150
Dad?

413
00:27:51,530 --> 00:27:53,360
We got to move.

414
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:14,810
Well,there's not much you can do,you know.

415
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:16,740
Excuse me,ladies.

416
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:17,850
I need to ask you a few questions.

417
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:20,680
I'm on the,uh,follow-up investigation team.

418
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:22,350
Excuse me.

419
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:26,220
Uh,we're just curious.

420
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:30,650
Did you see if the convicts actually found what they were digging for?

421
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:33,120
No.But sure sounded like they did.

422
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:38,490
The spaniard,he took off with one of my daughter's camping packs and he left the other ones in a real tizzy.

423
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:40,850
Sounded like he screwed 'em over something fierce.

424
00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:42,750
And-and they just let him leave?

425
00:28:42,770 --> 00:28:45,450
Well,they weren't happy about it,but,yeah.

426
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:48,580
He took off on his motorbike,and then they left a few minutes later.

427
00:28:48,610 --> 00:28:49,800
Together?
No.

428
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:53,970
The pretty one and the black fellow,they left first,and then that dirty southerner...

429
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:55,260
he snuck out the back.

430
00:28:55,280 --> 00:29:00,120
But he was moving kind of slow,you know,the weight of that backpack and that disability that...

431
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:01,780
wait a minute,he had a backpack,too?

432
00:29:01,810 --> 00:29:02,710
Yes.

433
00:29:02,730 --> 00:29:07,590
He came back in and slipped this into my brassiere on his way out.

434
00:29:07,610 --> 00:29:10,600
He said it was to cover the damages.

435
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:17,810
Um,we're going to need to keep this as evidence.

436
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,250
Thank you for your time.

437
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:21,080
get the car

438
00:29:29,930 --> 00:29:33,080
Seven,three,six,space.

439
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:35,210
Three,three,nine,space.

440
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:37,420
Eight,six,eight,seven.

441
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:40,540
And what exactly are you looking for?

442
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:41,600
A pattern.

443
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:43,200
A code.

444
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:44,650
Anything.

445
00:29:58,950 --> 00:30:01,340
result for number:7363398687

446
00:30:13,090 --> 00:30:15,690
What?What are you trying to tell me,michael?

447
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,370
They say...

448
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:22,470
people come into your life for a reason.

449
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:27,860
Maybe my reason was to help you get out of fox river.

450
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:32,080
You know,to help you save your brother.

451
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:33,650
No.

452
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:42,930
it's okay,papi.

453
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:45,920
Let me go.

454
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:49,660
We're a quarter mile up the river below the dam.

455
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:54,580
It's now or never,michael.

456
00:30:59,010 --> 00:31:00,630
I want you to hold your breath.Okay?

457
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:02,120
Why?
Just do it.

458
00:31:02,150 --> 00:31:04,540
I'll be right back,I promise.

459
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,270
What the hell are you doing?

460
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,720
all units to the river.

461
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:29,770
I want you to go under.

462
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:32,680
And then stick your arm up,above the water,high.

463
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:33,880
All right.

464
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:38,370
And then when you start running out of air,wave it back and forth so I can see it.

465
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:40,810
And I'll come back and get you.Okay?

466
00:31:40,850 --> 00:31:42,640
All right,give me your hand.

467
00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:45,320
One...

468
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:46,610
two...

469
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:47,970
three.

470
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:24,460
Come on.

471
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:25,580
Come on!

472
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,480
sucre!

473
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,910
Sucre!

474
00:33:47,890 --> 00:33:48,610
talk to me.

475
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:52,840
Well,there is one possibility,but it's almost too rudimentary.

476
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:58,460
We know we're not looking at a phone number,but maybe we're not looking at numbers at all.

477
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:06,170
What's important  are the letters  that correspond to that number.

478
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:10,940
Three dots,third letter

479
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:16,260
"R."  Two-- "d," "E."

480
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,940
Three possibilities per number.

481
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:21,310
That's thousands  of letter combinations.

482
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:27,040
But only one of them's  going to be right.

00:34:34,830 --> 00:34:36,730
She was right.

485
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:46,610
#1799
a real beauty

486
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:49,420
Hey.

487
00:34:49,450 --> 00:34:50,640
What are you in the market for?

488
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:53,070
Four wheels and a gas pedal.

489
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:56,040
Hey,petey.Uh,it's me.

490
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:58,850
Uh,listen,I-I got something to tell you.

491
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,720
Yeah,well,I was wondering when you were gonna call.

492
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:05,900
Yeah,um,a-a lot has come down since we last talked,and,uh...

493
00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:07,950
gee,I know,I heard.

494
00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:09,520
You ruined it.

495
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:10,720
Yeah.

496
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:13,090
you heard already?

497
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:16,490
Well,brother,everybody's heard,man,and let me tell you something,man.

498
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:18,510
Hector is pissed.

499
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:19,660
What does hector have to do with it?

500
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,430
It was his wedding.

501
00:35:21,450 --> 00:35:22,410
Wait,man.

502
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:24,270
What are you talking about?
Your bike.

503
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:26,320
What are you talking about?
The wedding.

504
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:27,680
What about the wedding?

505
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:30,610
Well,you know the part where,uh,you say,"I do"?

506
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:34,010
Maricruz said,"I don'T.

507
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:36,020
" She did?

508
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:42,210
Left homeboy standing at the altar holding his spam in his hand,if you know what I'm saying.

509
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,620
What were you telling me about my bike?

510
00:35:48,830 --> 00:35:49,920
All right.

511
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:51,700
I'll go get your keys.

512
00:35:52,170 --> 00:35:53,700
I got a couple stops to make.

513
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:55,970
First is this place called blanding.

514
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,250
Then we'll meet up with lincoln in a couple days.

515
00:35:57,270 --> 00:35:58,890
I can't go.

516
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:02,600
She said no,papi.

517
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:03,830
Maricruz...

518
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:05,400
maricruz told that son of A...

519
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:06,450
she told him no.

520
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,680
Can you believe that?

521
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:10,170
That's great.
I know.

522
00:36:10,370 --> 00:36:13,690
Now,I just...

523
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:16,530
no.Go on.Get your girl.

524
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:17,690
What about panama?We said that we were gonna...

525
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:21,210
some other time.Panama's not going to go anywhere.

526
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:28,000
This is,uh,in case you run into trouble down the road.

527
00:36:32,970 --> 00:36:35,060
In the river...

528
00:36:35,370 --> 00:36:37,680
I told you to leave me behind.

529
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:42,510
Yeah,well,I tried,but,uh,then I got tangled up in the rope,so...

530
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:48,230
okay,here you go.

531
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:54,650
Thanks,and,uh,we'll need another car.

532
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:03,030
Do you really think the diaper sniper got all of it?

533
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:04,480
Only one way to find out.

534
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:09,730
If you were bagwell,and you just got your hands on $5 million,where would you go?

535
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:35,310
s.hollander
1605 midberry hill

536
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:39,260
You think you're the only  one who feels betrayed?

537
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,830
I'm gonna get out of here some day.

538
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:49,370
And when I do,don't think I won't remember what your front steps look like.

539
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:05,680
Let me get this straight.

540
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:08,280
You-you paid that meth-head to whoop my ass?

541
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:09,320
Yup.

542
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:12,080
Feds were waiting for me to come get you.It was the only way.

543
00:38:12,110 --> 00:38:14,000
It worked,didn't it?

544
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:16,700
Yeah,it got me four stitches.

545
00:38:17,270 --> 00:38:18,460
Adds character.

546
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,980
Here,take that.

547
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,600
There's some ice in there.Put it on the eye.

548
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:24,690
Keep the swelling down.

549
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:30,310
I've been in a few fights in my day,too.

550
00:38:32,370 --> 00:38:33,970
Too many.

551
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:41,180
rendez vous
sundown/hot

552
00:39:02,610 --> 00:39:04,670
There's one more.

553
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:15,560
Clean it.

554
00:39:15,590 --> 00:39:17,930
Every surface,like she never came home.

555
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:48,560
You know,waiting for your flight from utah,I had a little extra time for due diligence,

556
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:52,730
so I decided to dig a little deeper on your history,or rather lack of one.

557
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,590
Starts off simple enough.

558
00:39:54,610 --> 00:39:57,080
Poor family.Mom leaves,cites spousal abuse.

559
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:59,450
Somehow your dad holds onto custody,and

560
00:39:59,470 --> 00:40:03,870
by the look of these pediatric meds,he beats you like a harp seal for the next four years.

561
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:07,780
Big shock-- poor,abused kid,not a lot of options-- he joins the military.

562
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:10,880
Will there be  any actual questions,or is this just a show-and-tell?

563
00:40:10,910 --> 00:40:12,030
Okay,I got one.

564
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:15,580
How does a guy go from infantry grunt with less than stellar marks

565
00:40:15,610 --> 00:40:23,100
to the gulf 1,special ops,to the federal bureau of investigations,leading the largest manhunt this country's ever seen?

566
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:25,750
I have all these dots.

567
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:28,590
And there's just no way to connect them.

568
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:31,580
Looks like you need to work on your clearance level...dick.

569
00:40:31,610 --> 00:40:32,990
Or maybe I just work on you.

570
00:40:33,010 --> 00:40:33,790
You want to do this?

571
00:40:33,810 --> 00:40:37,890
I will chain you to this desk until I get some answers I cannot fertilize my lawn with.

572
00:40:37,910 --> 00:40:39,190
You sure you want to do this?

573
00:40:39,210 --> 00:40:42,240
I know what they tell you to do overseas,alex,

574
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:47,410
and let me make it perfectly clear-- we do not do it on american soil.

575
00:40:47,430 --> 00:40:49,230
Sir,uh,there's a phone call for you.

576
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:50,790
I'll take it later.

577
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:53,560
Uh,sir,you're gonna want to take this now.

578
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:00,900
Yeah.

579
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:02,740
Yes,sir.

580
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:04,750
I,uh...

581
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:06,450
I'm with him now.

582
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:10,050
Yes,sir.

583
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:11,070
Okay.

584
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,160
Where you going,rick?

585
00:41:17,290 --> 00:41:20,690
I thought we were really starting to get somewhere.

586
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:23,770
Let's go.

587
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:41,170
Alex.

588
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,430
You got something for me?

589
00:41:48,850 --> 00:41:50,280
open it.

590
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,540
The numbers correlate to the letters on a phone.

591
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:58,700
Only on this one,none of the possible combinations make sense.

592
00:41:58,730 --> 00:42:01,500
We think it's a location,a rendezvous point for michael scofield.

593
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:04,340
You find it,you find him.

594
00:42:04,390 --> 00:42:06,750
You know,you could have gotten me out of there sooner.

595
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:11,000
You know,even we have to go through certain channels to make things appear on the up-and-up.

596
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:14,880
You know all about that,don't you,alex?

597
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:17,390
Keeping up appearances.

598
00:42:19,210 --> 00:42:20,710
Good.

599
00:42:21,370 --> 00:42:26,690
I was just making sure that we're still clear on the directive of this manhunt.

600
00:42:26,830 --> 00:42:31,140
You know,I understand the,uh,reasoning behind burrows and scofield,

601
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:33,910
but these other men-- criminals that they may be--

602
00:42:33,930 --> 00:42:37,660
there's nothing in their profiles to suggest...
you've been hired to do a job.

603
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:40,980
The reasoning does not concern you.

604
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,980
Don't ask any questions about us,and maybe we'll continue to make sure no one asks any questions about you.

605
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,400
Are we clear?

606
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:53,250
They all die.

607
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:56,810
They all die.

608
00:42:56,920 --> 00:43:02,130
