孩子 我对你没什么成见
I got nothing against you, kid.

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:06,990
你要做什么?
What are you doing, man?

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,280
但是子弹有
But they do.

你们的好朋友曼彻告诉了我有关 
Your pal manche told me all about your little treasure hunt

11
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:29,770
你父亲接到了通白宫打来的电话

12
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:31,150
撤销了你父亲的候选提名

13
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:34,180
根据他们的说法 你父亲的批准程序有些问题
According to them, his confirmation was going to be a problem.

14
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:36,280
我爸爸不会自杀的
My father is not a suicidal man.

15
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:38,430
唐克雷蒂州长不在我们计划之内
Governor Tancredi, not part of our plan.

16
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:40,650
任何知道蛛丝马迹的人都不能放过
Anyone who knows anything has got to be dealt with.

17
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:42,420
如果有人成了累赘  就干掉他们
If someone's a liability, they go.

18
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:44,140
唐克雷蒂就是个累赘
Tancredi was becoming a liability.

19
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:45,390
他女儿也是
So was his daughter.

20
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,950
等等  什么?
Wait, what?

21
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,190
布伦斯按计划将于
Burrows is scheduled to be released

22
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,820
明日在其关押地亚利桑那州的

24
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:57,190
LJ释放出来了 我要去接他
LJ is out there;I'm going to get him.

25
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,990
保重
Take care.

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,750
查尔斯 韦斯特莫兰德...
Charles Westmoreland...

27
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:06,190
愿上帝保佑你  还有你的破麻袋
god bless you and your wrinkled old sack.

28
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,420
全在这儿了
It's all here.

29
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:09,090
苏克雷在哪?
Where's Sucre?

30
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:10,390
放下包
Drop the bag.

31
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,230
谁都不许走
No one's going anywhere.

32
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:25,620
你他妈的在搞什么鬼?
What the hell are you doing, man?

33
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:27,750
苏克雷 不论你想要什么
Sucre...whatever it is you want...

34
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:30,690
我要钱  所有的钱
I want the money, all of it.

35
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:32,020
什么  你要抢我们的钱?
What, are you robbing us?

36
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:34,390
钱本来就不是你们的
The money was never yours to begin with.

37
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,590
这只是一个交易
This is about business.

38
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,850
500万美金值得我搏一记
$5 million worth of business.

39
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:40,590
这就是我们共患难的结果?
So this is how it's going to go down, huh?

40
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:44,100
我们共同经历了所有的事
After everything.

41
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:46,620
贼就是江山易改本性难移
Once a thief, always a thief.

42
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:47,990
你才意识到啊?
You just figuring that out?

43
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,620
给我背包
The backpack.

44
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:54,760
快!
Now!

45
00:01:56,930 --> 00:02:00,430
兄弟  别这么做
Don't do this, buddy.

46
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:02,970
小子  你自己好好合计一下
Yo, take a look around you, papi.

47
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:04,720
我们有三个人而你只孤身一人
It's three of us, it's one of you

48
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:07,710
难道这笔帐你不会算 我们会一直追你到天涯海角
you are outnumbered, man, and we will come after you.

49
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,210
兄弟  这可能是你能做的最后一件事了
It'll be the last thing you do, my brother.

50
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:10,950
你打算把我们都打死?
What, are you going to shoot at all of us?

51
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:14,460
也许不会
Probably not.

52
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:17,830
但是我可以打死两个
but I will get two.

53
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,540
现在...
Now...

54
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:23,390
谁想成为那两个呢?
which two is it going to be?

55
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,220
这就对了
That's what I thought.

56
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:29,360
再见  朋友们
Adios, amigos.

57
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,650
我真不敢相信
I don't believe this.

58
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:40,790
我们历经艰险 好不容易光明就在眼前
We have come all this way and done all of this work.

59
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,900
纹身小子  你们不还是好兄弟吗?
Thought you was compadres, tattoo?

60
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:47,890
伙计们  那我们现在怎么办
so what are we going to do now, man?

61
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,890
警察随时都会到
The police are going to be here any second.

62
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:52,890
我绝不能容忍那傻大个带着
Ain't no way I'm letting that- that dunderpate

63
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,720
五百万跑了…
ride off with five...

64
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:58,730
你们自己决定吧
It's your choice.

65
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:08,130
放心没什么事
It's all right.

66
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:14,450
别担心  给你这个  然后...
all right, I'm going to give you this, and, uh...

67
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,890
大约一个小时后你就可以
you should be able to cut yourself free

68
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:19,700
割断绳子重获自由
in about an hour.

69
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:21,590
伙计  你有什么计划?
So what's the plan, man?

70
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,220
你想做什么都行
Well, you can do what you want.

71
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:25,820
我让帝博格那个变态逃过一次
I let that psychopath t-bag loose once.

72
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:28,020
我不会再让他逃脱惩罚
I'm not going to do it again.

73
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:32,860
警察来的时候给他们留个小礼物
Make a nice little present for the police when they get here.

74
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:41,400
他哪儿去了?
Where is he?

75
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,850
我不知道
I don't know

76
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:47,950
伙计  我也该…我也该走了
man, look, I got to, I got to go.

77
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:51,460
好运
Uh, good luck.

78
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:05,230
他们会抓到你的
They're going to get you.

79
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:21,050
唐克雷蒂小姐
Ms.Tancredi.

80
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:22,490
我并不想吓到你
I didn't mean to startle you.

81
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,220
该死的  你在我屋里干什么?
What the hell are you doing in my house?

82
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:25,990
没什么好怕的
No reason to be frightened.

83
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,790
我以前和你父亲一起工作
I used to work with your father.

84
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,430
对你父亲的死我深表遗憾
I'm so sorry for your loss.

85
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:44,130
我父亲不是自杀的
My father didn't commit suicide.

86
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:47,120
你在干什么?
What are you doing?

87
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:48,590
让人确信我没像之前那样吸毒
Making sure it doesn't look like I did!

88
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,850
如果州长自杀的当天
People will ask questions

89
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:52,120
他女儿也被发现死于非命 现场还留有搏斗痕迹
if the day the governor was found killing himself

90
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:56,790
那么人们肯定会产生疑惑
his daughter is found dead in what looks like a struggle.

91
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,790
那么  好吧
Well, then.

92
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,120
如果他们找不到她呢?
What if they don't find her?

93
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:05,390
很明显州长的女儿为了避免牢狱之灾
In an apparent attempt to avoid jail time,

94
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:09,720
在保释中逃走并消失了
the governor's daughter skips bail and disappears.

95
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:11,920
我们在说你最后的几分钟  唐克雷蒂小姐
We're talking about your last minutes, Ms.Tancredi.

96
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:13,490
别这么做
Please don't do this.

97
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,520
桌子上的东西非常昂贵
That stuff on that table is premium.

98
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:16,790
A等品
It's grade "A".

99
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,250
帮你自己个忙
Do yourself a favor

100
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:19,520
出去享受一下
go out on a high.

101
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:20,920
我求求你
Look, I'm begging you here.

102
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:24,730
最后的盛宴
One last ride.

103
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:28,830
哦  妈的!
Oh, god!

104
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:29,230
"再见 朋友们"嗯?
Adios, amigos, huh?

105
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:33,550
怎么?  演过头了?
What? Too much?

106
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:37,600
干得漂亮
You were great.

107
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,790
老兄  这东西真他妈的重
this thing is freaking heavy, dude.

108
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,120
分了它就不会这么重了
Won't be so bad after we split it up.

109
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:46,650
3个人分  我  你  还有林肯
Three ways: Me, you and Linc.

110
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:48,220
是4个
Four.

111
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:50,490
我们得分给查尔斯的女儿一部分
We're going to send a share to Charles's daughter

112
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,820
并捎上他父亲给她的爱
with her father's love

113
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:52,890
正如之前承诺的那样
just like we promised.

114
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:55,220
富兰克林怎么办?
What about C-Note?

115
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:56,420
我总觉得整件事有点不太好
I feel kind of bad about the whole thing.

116
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:57,950
我们没法知道该不该信任他
There's no way to know if we could trust him.

117
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,190
等我们到了巴拿马
Once we get down to Panama

118
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,350
我们再往他家里汇些钱吧
we'll send something up to his family

119
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,520
确保他能过好点
make sure he's taken care of.

120
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:05,990
500万美金
Five million dollars.

121
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,290
我真不敢相信  我就要成为...
I can't believe I'm going to be...

122
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:14,320
见鬼钱到哪去了?
where the hell is the money?

123
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:18,600
见鬼钱到哪去了?
Where the hell is the money?

124
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:49,130
背包...快!
The backpack...Now!

125
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:02,880
出售汽车
for sale by owner

126
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,220
布伦斯先生?
Mr.Burrows?

127
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:01,020
恭喜你出来!

Here's a list of options available to you.

129
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:07,080
有些公司更愿意雇一些出狱的人
Places to stay, businesses that are more open to hiring.....

130
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:23,670
对你即将面对的未来有什么问题吗?
Any questions you might have about your immediate future?

131
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:27,150
没有

132
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:32,900
好吧  这上面的电话是免费的
Well, the number on there is toll-free.

-Thanks. Wait a second.

135
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,140
你知道吗?
You know what?

136
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:40,800
为什么不告诉我你要去哪呢？
Why don't you tell me where you need to go

137
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:45,010
我可以载你过去
and I'll make sure you get there.

138
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:48,390
行了  我没事的
You know, I think I'll be all right.

139
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,860
你确定?

140
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:53,380
是的  谢谢
Yeah.Thank you.

141
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:03,740
孩子没上钩
Kid didn't bite.

142
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:04,800
他步行的
He's on foot

143
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:05,870
好吧
All right.

144
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,970
派人跟着他
Have your men follow.

145
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:09,240
记住我们要找的是他爸爸
Remember, it's the father we want.

146
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,270
我们不可以回去
We can't go back.

147
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,040
你说过  没钱我们就完蛋了
You said it, without the money, we're screwed.

148
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:16,810
我们不能...让我想想
We can't... just let me think.

149
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:18,470
或许还在...让我想想!让我想想!
- Maybe it's still back... - Just let me think! Let me think.

150
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,540
或许钱还在屋里
Maybe it's still back at the house.

151
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:22,140
钱不在屋里
The money's not back at the house

152
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:26,500
除非帝博格还在那儿
unless T-Bag is

153
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:29,000
他一定是把背包换了
He must've switched the packs.

154
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:30,440
那...?
wh-what do we do...

155
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:32,140
我们现在怎么办?
what do we do now?

156
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:34,400
这里还有5千美元
We still got the five grand we took

157
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:36,640
装钱的时候留下的
when we pocketed the money.

158
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:39,170
没有五百万那么多
It's not gonna be five million

159
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,900
但也足够我们到要去的地方了
but it might be enough to get us where we're going.

160
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:42,640
各单位注意
All units be advised.

161
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:45,770
福克斯河监狱的逃犯被确定
Escaped convicts from fox river have been positively ID'd

162
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:47,800
在蒙特里路1131号
at 1131 monterey lane

163
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:49,470
我们已经出动警犬进行搜索
We have dogs being dispatched to the location.

164
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:52,770
进出镇的每条路都封锁起来
I want every road in or out of town blocked off.

165
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:54,940
不管是汽车  火车  还是走路
I don't care if it's on wheels, rails or hooves.

166
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:58,770
都拦下来  仔细检查
I want it stopped and searched.

167
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:00,740
我记得你说过我们始终快他们一程
I thought you said we would have a head start.

168
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:02,140
是那枪声暴露了
It was the gunshot, buddy.

169
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:03,870
一定是被某个邻居听到了
One of the neighbors must've heard.

170
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,440
那东西能开多快?
How fast can that thing go?

171
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:06,540
不知道
I don't know.

172
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:09,710
我们俩的话  或许...
Both of us, it could probably...

173
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:15,640
我们不可能从马路走了
we're never gonna get out of here on the roads.

174
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:18,530
我们得想其他途径
We need to find another way.

175
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:21,840
伊利诺州  芝加哥   FBI办公室
Chicago, Illinois FBI Filed Office

176
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:24,370
他在你办公室了
He's in your office.

177
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:26,140
谁让他进来的?
Who let him in?

178
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:27,770
真难以置信这个节骨眼上把我招回
I can't believe they're calling me back here

179
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:29,000
那些逃犯都还逍遥法外
when my escapees are out there.

180
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:30,570
我想知道这个家伙是谁
I want to know who this guy is.

181
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:34,140
他说他叫萨林斯
Said his name was Sullins.

182
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:35,340
狗娘养的
Son of a bitch.

183
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:41,910
逃犯这边有什么进展马上通知我
Let me know if anything breaks on the convicts.

184
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:44,140
亚历克斯
Alex.

185
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:45,170
谢谢你能来
Thanks for coming in.

186
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:46,600
你能告诉我为什么内务部
You want to tell me why internal affairs is pulling me out of the field

187
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:48,700
在我追踪逃犯中途招回我?
in the middle of a manhunt?

188
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:51,440
好久没和你坐下来谈谈了吧?
It's been a while since we've had a sit-down, hasn't it?

189
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:53,200
自从肖逃走以来都没有过吧?
Not since the shales escape, am I right?

190
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:54,770
是的  到底怎么样  理查德?
Yeah, yeah. What's going on, Richard?

191
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:56,270
好吧...
Well...

192
00:11:56,280 --> 00:12:00,650
这正是我来这的目的
that's precisely what I'm here to find out.

193
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:06,110
在我完事前你不能出去
And you're not getting out of here until I do.

194
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:10,500
怀俄明州  莱曼
Lyman, Wyoming

195
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:12,900
哦  天哪
Oh, my god.

196
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:17,010
人类的文明
Civilization.

197
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:30,470
要点什么?
What can I get for you boys?

198
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,270
你看呢
You tell me.

199
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,900
两杯水吧
Two waters, then.

200
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:37,470
知道你是好心人  让我用下电话吧
And the use of your phone, if you'd be so kind.

201
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:41,810
别担心  只打个市内电话而已
Don't worry, it's a local call.

202
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:46,370
我回家第一件事就是换条干净的内裤
First thing I do, we get home: Clean underwear.

203
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:47,400
然后呢?
Then what?

204
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:48,470
可能会回那个便利店
I guess go back to that liquor store

205
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,180
求他们让我继续干下去
beg for my job back.

206
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:56,740
我们曾有过机会
We had it.

207
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:58,940
可惜擦肩而过
We were so close.

208
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:02,740
我甚至还能依稀闻到那钱的味道
I can still taste that money right there in the back of my throat.

209
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,100
我现在不考虑别的
Well, nothing that a couple of Keystones

210
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:05,800
只想美美地吃上一顿汉堡肉饼
a hungry man salisbury steak dinner

211
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:10,410
然后坐在电视机前看看电视
and a night in front of the TV won't take care of.

212
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:15,040
嘿  妈妈  是我
Hey, mom, it's Brad.

213
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:19,500
我和罗伊的车子出了点问题
Hey, listen, me and Roy, we ran into some car trouble and...

214
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:21,600
你能否来接我们
we were wondering if you could come pick us up.

215
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:23,240
不知道  等一下
I don't know, hold on.

216
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:24,900
这该死的小镇叫什么?
What the hell town is this?

217
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:27,440
你不是说仅打个市内电话吗
Thought you said this was a local call.

218
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:29,570
嘿  布拉德利  看看这个
Hey, Bradley, check this out.

219
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:30,740
别挂  妈妈
Wait, mom.

220
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:33,070
据报道这些人就是
These individuals were reportedly the prisoners

221
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:38,500
几天前从伊利诺斯州福克斯河监狱逃出来的逃犯
who escaped from the fox river penitentiary in Illinois just a couple of days ago.

222
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:40,970
他们到底来犹他州的图勒镇做什么?
What were they doing all the way out here in Tooele, Utah?

223
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:44,100
根据珍妮特 欧文斯所说
Well, Jeanette Owens

224
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:45,300
她的车库被这些人挖开了
whose garage they dug up, has her own theory.

225
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:51,300
他们假装成电力公司的工作人员
They pretended that they were some kind of workers from the power company,

226
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:54,100
然后说这里有些问题
and that they had made a mistake

227
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:57,370
他们必须挖开修复
and they'd have to do some digging.

228
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:58,770
妈  我又想了想
Hey, mom, on second thought

229
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:01,700
你能不能给我们汇点现金?
uh, can you wire us some extra scratch?

230
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:05,580
事实上  我们还要办点事
Turns out, we ain't done yet.

231
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:20,670
你好
Hello.

232
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:21,970
布鲁斯  你得帮帮我
Bruce, I need your help.

233
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:23,170
莎拉?
Sara?

234
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:25,470
布鲁斯  我爸爸不是自杀的  知道吗?
Bruce, my father didn't commit suicide, okay?

235
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,900
冷静点  你在哪?
Okay, just calm down. Where are you?

236
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:29,340
他正在调查布伦斯的案子
He was looking into the Burrows case

237
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:30,600
我想他发现了一些
and I think that he found something

238
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:31,970
别人不想让他知道的事情
that they didn't want him to know.

239
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:34,540
我想现在他们认为我也知道了这些事
And now, I think that they think that I know it, too.

240
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:36,000
好吧  我要你听我说
All right, I want you to listen to me.

241
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:37,500
我派人来接你
I'm gonna send someone over to pick you up.

242
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:41,440
我先把你接回来 我保证我们一起把这事彻底解决
I'll bring you back here, and we'll sort all of this out, I promise.

243
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:42,700
告诉我你在哪里
Just tell me where you are.

244
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:44,870
我不知道  我在一个电话亭...
Uh, I don't know, I'm at a pay phone on...

245
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,040
第三大道和哈柏路的交叉口
Third and Harper.

246
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:48,940
你带手机了吗? 到时我可以联系你
Do you have your cell in case I need to reach you?

247
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:51,400
带了  但我想一定已经被监听了
Uh, I do, but I-I thought it would be tapped.

248
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:52,300
我不知道
I don't know.

249
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:53,940
好吧  我的人过去了
All right, someone's on their way.

250
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:55,240
待在那
Just stay right where you are.

251
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:59,350
谢谢
Thank you.

252
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:10,170
我出价80元
I'll give you 80 bucks for them.

253
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:11,500
不是吧  伙计 他们值...
Come on, man, they're worth...

254
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:12,570
对真正的主人来说
worth a lot more

255
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:14,540
当然远不止这个数
to the person they actually belong to.

256
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:16,970
这些是女子俱乐部的东西  伙计
These are ladies clubs, doctor.

257
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:18,200
我想她们比你那男人短裤
I'm guessing they're hotter

258
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:20,370
可要性感多了
than a monkey's jockstrap

259
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:23,510
80元
80 bucks.

260
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:30,250
加上那个冰块盒的话就成交
Throw in the cooler, and you got a deal.

261
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:34,640
我们必须丢弃这辆车了
We got to lose the bike.

262
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:35,870
不行
No way.

263
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,200
路都被封了
The roads are sealed.

264
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:38,570
这是我们从这里出去的唯一的办法
It's the only way we're gonna make it out of here.

265
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:39,870
老兄那我可办不到   我答应过皮提...
I can't, bro.I promised petey...

266
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:42,070
你不能把这辆车弄过河去
you're not getting that thing across the river.

267
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:45,800
我们浪费一分钟就少一分钟  明白吗?
And every minute we spend trying is a minute we don't have, okay?

268
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:47,770
对不起
I'm sorry.

269
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:51,050
我们得走了
We got to move.

270
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:01,840
我听说过这种地方
I've heard about these kinds of places.

271
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:02,940
有水蛭的  你知道吗
They got leeches, you know.

272
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:05,400
我宁愿被这里的水蛭咬
I'll take the leeches in here

273
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:07,140
也不愿被后面追兵拷住
over the handcuffs back there.

274
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:08,100
那可不好说啊
I don't know, papi.

275
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:09,640
要看这些水蛭咬什么地方
Sort of depends on where the leech leeches

276
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:12,880
-知道我说什么吗? -别开玩笑了
-you know what I'm saying? -Stop kidding around.

277
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:27,470
你还好吧  兄弟?
Are you all right, buddy?

278
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:30,200
我...我动不了了!
I can't... I can't move!

279
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:32,140
有什么地方受伤的吗?
You feel like you broke anything?

280
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:33,500
没有  我想应该没有
No, I don't think so.

281
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:34,600
能不能把这个?
Can you get it?

282
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:38,450
把它从我身上移走?
Can you get it off me?

283
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:45,500
一点都推不动
This thing's not going anywhere.

284
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:49,210
我下去看看你的脚
I'm gonna check your foot.

285
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:04,840
真不幸  伙计
I'm sorry, buddy.

286
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:08,950
卡住了
It's stuck.

287
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,380
你去打911
you, call 911.

288
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:56,170
凯莉  我叫莎拉 我是医生
Kelli, my name is Sara.I'm a doctor.

289
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:58,240
你会没事的  听得到我说话吗?
You're gonna be okay. Can you hear me?

290
00:17:58,250 --> 00:17:59,370
你会没事的
You'll be all right.

291
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:03,310
深呼吸  然后...
Take some deep breaths and...

292
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:05,700
凯莉?
Kelli?

293
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:08,980
凯莉
Kelli.

294
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:18,340
会没事的  是吧?
It's gonna be okay, right?

295
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:21,970
我是说既然你能把我们八个人从监狱里弄出来
I mean, if you can get eight people out of prison,

296
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:26,410
当然也可以把我从这里弄出来 是吧?
you can get my puerto rican ass out of this, right?

297
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,550
可以吧?
Can't you?

298
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:40,500
加把劲!
Come on!

299
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:43,810
该死的!
Damn it!

300
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:55,900
听到了吗?
Do you hear that?

301
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:59,140
我知道那个声音
I know that sound.

302
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:03,250
河的上游有个坝
There's a dam up river.

303
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:04,640
这是个信号
It's a signal.

304
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:07,670
意味着他们开闸了
It means they're opening the locks.

305
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,500
这就意味着水面要上涨了
That means the water level's gonna rise

306
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:10,500
水面上升后
and when it does

307
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:12,040
这根木头就会漂走的
the log will just float right off.

308
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:13,740
真的?
Yeah?

309
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:15,440
警犬部队闻到了几种气味
Canine units at the scene have multiple scents

310
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:17,100
现正分头到田里搜索
and are spreading out into the field.

311
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:18,440
痕迹是刚留下的
Trail's fresh.

312
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:22,940
这几个家伙跑不远
These guys can't have gotten very far.

313
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:25,200
后面有6个人在搜那屋子
There were six cons back at that house.

314
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:27,340
他们会从各个方向来追捕我们
They'll be tracking us in every direction.

315
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:29,700
搜到这里得花上一个小时
It'll take an hour just to make it over this far

316
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:33,170
到那个时候  水面上涨  我们也早跑了
and by that time, the water level will rise, we'll be long gone.

317
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:36,170
你确定?
Are you sure?

318
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:39,170
是的  我肯定
Yeah, I'm sure.

319
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:42,540
我确定
I'm sure.

320
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:44,570
去问问当时在场的20个警察中的任何一个
Ask any of the 20 cops there,

321
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:46,170
 约翰  阿布鲁奇是带着武器的
John Abruzzi was armed.

322
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:47,300
约翰 阿布鲁奇拿出了武器
John Abruzzi drew his weapon...

323
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:49,270
根本不该允许他走那么远
he never should have been allowed to get that far.

324
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,440
理查德  让我们说清楚
Richard, let's be clear.

325
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:52,300
如果你知道追捕逃犯应该怎样掌控局势
If you knew how things needed to be handled in a manhunt,

326
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:54,340
你就会让他逃跑
you'd be out there running one

327
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:57,840
而不是把他打瘸
instead of hamstringing the men that are.

328
00:19:57,850 --> 00:20:00,970
FBI调查这起越狱事件的主要目标是
The FBI's primary objective in investigating fugitive matters

329
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:03,340
掌握他们的逃逸地点
is to affect the swift location

330
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:04,670
并抓住这些逃犯
and capture of the fugitives.

331
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,840
你已经杀了两个人了  亚历克斯
You have two dead bodies, Alex.

332
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:08,540
理查德 我只是杀了两个重刑犯
I've got two dead felons, Richard.

333
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:10,040
现在也许从公众关系的角度来说
Now, maybe that doesn't play well

334
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:11,940
这件事做得并不好
from a public relations standpoint,

335
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:13,500
但从公众安全这个角度上
but from a public safety standpoint

336
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:15,800
阿布鲁奇和阿克斯按常理是应该被杀的
Abruzzi and Apolskis were by the book.

337
00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:18,770
近距离的向一个手无寸铁的小孩子射击
Shooting of an unarmed kid at point-blank range

338
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:20,000
也是符合常理的吗？
is by the book?

339
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:22,800
别狡辩了
Come on.

340
00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:24,070
报告上说
Incident report

341
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,940
大卫 阿克斯
David "Tweener" Apolskis.

342
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:28,970
你知道  我很好奇 他在押送途中带手铐了吗？
You know, I'm curious, was he cuffed during transport?

343
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,040
是的
Yeah

344
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:31,270
这么说是他不知怎么
Says in here he somehow

345
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,670
成功地抢了你的枪
managed to grab your primary weapon.

346
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,940
-你的枪放在肩膀上的还是臀部上的枪套里? -臀部的
- You carry that in a shoulder holster? - Hip.

347
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:37,270
左边  右边?右边  左边?
Left, right? Right, left?

348
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,740
左边
Left.

349
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:39,670
左边
Left.

350
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:45,540
对不起  我时常会搞混
I'm sorry, I get confused sometimes.

351
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:47,500
所以我可以这样推断
So just so I've got this right

352
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:51,270
你当时单独押着一个带着手铐的犯人开车
you were driving along alone with a cuffed prisoner,

353
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:54,140
然后不知怎的他袭向你的胸部
and somehow he reaches forward across your chest

354
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:57,550
抢了你的枪
and grabs your weapon.

355
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,000
很遗憾你和阿克斯在一起时
It's too bad you didn't react that quickly

356
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:00,600
反应还没有现在这么快
with Apolskis.

357
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:05,050
也许他还能活着
Maybe he'd still be alive.

358
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:45,070
有个计划可以解决所有问题
there's a plan to make all of this right

359
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,900
一只纸鹤能和这个有什么关系?
What does an origami bird have to do with any of this?

360
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:51,170
那是迈克尔・斯科菲尔德寄给她的
Michael Scofield sent it to her.

361
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:52,840
既然你为了平息事情
And since your brilliant plan

362
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:55,070
而打算把莎拉  唐克雷蒂除掉的杰出计划
to eliminate Sara Tancredi from the equation

363
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,040
-已经彻底失败了 -我不会说是彻底失败
-failed so completely -I wouldn't say it failed completely at all.

364
00:21:57,050 --> 00:22:01,970
在电话亭里死了一个女人
There's a dead woman in a phone booth.

365
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:03,200
一个无辜百姓
Civilian.

366
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:06,570
你可以把一部分人的死归结于某人名下
A certain number of bodies you can sweep under the rug.

367
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:09,570
不过以总统的名义已经行不通了
President's rug is getting so full, you can hardly stand on it.

368
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:13,040
那你觉得我们该怎么做?
So what do you suggest we should do?

369
00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:16,040
你钓过鱼吗  比尔?
You ever go fishing, Bill?

370
00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:17,200
请说重点
Just make your point.

371
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:18,640
捕鱼有两种方法
There's two ways to catch a fish.

372
00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:19,840
撒一张大网
You cast out a big

373
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:22,440
然后祈祷能得到你所想要的东西
net and hope you get what you're looking for.

374
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:26,670
要不你就得挑选合适的诱饵 并确保行之无误
Or you choose the right bait and guarantee that you do.

375
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:29,070
方法就是这么简单 世间万事也都如此这般
It's a simple strategy, plays across the board.

376
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,470
LJ会带我们找到布伦斯
LJ will lead us to Burrows.

377
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,370
莎拉会把我们引向斯科菲尔德
Sara will lead us to Scofield.

378
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:34,640
那你打算怎么跟踪莎拉?
And how do you intend to follow Sara,

379
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:36,300
她带给你的只有一直纸鹤
when the only lead you've got is an origami bird

380
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:38,440
和一个停机的电话号码
with an out of service phone number?

381
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:44,280
也许那根本不是电话号码
Maybe it's not a phone number.

382
00:22:57,050 --> 00:22:58,700
你发现什么了?
What do you have?

383
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:01,440
那小鬼出来了  不过仍没有布伦斯的踪影
Junior's on the move, but still no sign of Burrows.

384
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:02,740
先生  那家伙藏匿起来了
Sir, the guy's in hiding

385
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:04,600
或许他还不知道儿子出来了
maybe he doesn't even know his kid's out.

386
00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:08,000
犹他州那个被挟持的女警察已证实
The cop that was held hostage in Utah

387
00:23:08,010 --> 00:23:10,020
在布伦斯得知LJ被释放后
has Burrows splitting off from the rest of the group

388
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:11,800
他就脱离他们那一伙了
just after word of LJ's release hit the wire.

389
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:13,440
他一定知道的
He knows.

390
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:15,770
现在如果想知道他到底在不在这儿
Now if we want to know for sure if he's there

391
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:20,910
我们得采取点行动把他引出来
we need to do something to draw him out.

392
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:37,370
给点零钱花花
Hey, you mind sparing some change?

393
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:39,000
没有
No.

394
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:40,300
给点吧
Come on.

395
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:41,600
没有  我身无分文
No, I'm all tapped out.

396
00:23:41,610 --> 00:23:42,770
你一定有点什么
You got something.

397
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:44,770
我要拿走你身上的一切
I'll take whatever you got.

398
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:50,080
老实说  我刚被放出来 要是我有的话一定会给你
Look, seriously, I just got out of lock-up.

399
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:53,000
抱歉
Sorry.

400
00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:55,070
我知道了  你觉得你比我强  是吧?
I see, you think you're better than me, huh?

401
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:57,440
我没觉得比你强
I don't think I'm better than you.

402
00:23:57,450 --> 00:23:59,900
小子 你要往哪儿跑?
Yo, where you running, little man?

403
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:03,550
我哪也不去
I'm not running anywhere.

404
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:15,940
本不该这样的
This isn't how it's supposed to go.

405
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:17,840
我越狱只有一个理由
The whole reason I went along with the break

406
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:21,970
就是想和玛丽克鲁兹还有我的孩子共度此生
was to have a life with Maricruz and my baby.

407
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:22,940
而现在呢？
And now what?

408
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:25,240
找份普通工作
Get some two-bit job?

409
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:29,600
心平气和的看待一切?
Always be looking over my shoulder?

410
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:32,670
那种生活怎样?
What kind of life is that?

411
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,570
你可以和我还有林肯一起
You can come with me and Linc.

412
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:35,800
到巴拿马去
To Panama.

413
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:36,970
从头开始
Start over.

414
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:38,340
你待在这越久
The longer you stay here

415
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:40,640
就越没机会去巴拿马
the more chance there is you'll never make it to Panama.

416
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:43,240
你还有其他要牵挂的人
You've got other people to think about.

417
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:45,300
你哥哥  你外甥
Your brother, your nephew.

418
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:47,470
还有莎拉
Sara.

419
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,570
她会在巴拿马等你  对吧?
She's meeting you down there, isn't she?

420
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:51,100
我不知道
I don't know.

421
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:53,040
我们从没谈过此事
We never talked about it.

422
00:24:53,050 --> 00:24:54,180
但你希望如此
But you're hoping.

423
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:55,440
这个等会再说  行吗
Just give it a rest, will you.

424
00:24:55,450 --> 00:24:57,500
警犬们已经锁定住目标 我们还发现两条痕印合并一块了
The dogs are locked in. We've got two trails merging.

425
00:24:57,510 --> 00:24:58,870
他们一定在这儿
They were definitely here.

426
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,100
他们往东边的爵克农场去了
They've headed east towards drucker ranch.

427
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:02,100
他们离开大路了  还需要人手
They've gone off-road.Any additional units

428
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:03,970
我们得形成一个一英里的包围圈
we need to setup a one-mile perimeter

429
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:04,970
然后开始缩小范围
and then start closing in.

430
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:09,380
水越来越深了
It's getting deeper.

431
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:15,810
这个烦人的玩意怎么还是一动不动的?
So how come this freaking thing ain't moving yet?

432
00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:20,110
我来看看
Let me check

433
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:30,900
你还好吗？
You all right?

434
00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:32,700
听着  迈克尔
Hey, Michael...

435
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:34,440
我明白如果你要继续走的话...
I understand if you have to keep going, you know.

436
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:36,000
别说那个
Don't say that.

437
00:25:36,010 --> 00:25:37,170
我哪儿也不去
I'm not going anywhere.

438
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:38,740
不  还是想想吧
No, but, look, just think about it.

439
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:40,000
我不会让你就这么淹死
You know, if I leave you drown.

440
00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:41,440
不  我知道  但是
No, I know, but just...

441
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:43,400
水面正在升高  苏克雷
the water level's getting higher, Sucre.

442
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:45,170
你能屏住呼吸多少秒?
How many seconds can you hold your breath?

443
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:46,600
45秒? 60秒?
45? 60?

444
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:49,070
如果我走了你就只能活那么久
That's how long you've got to live if I take off.

445
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,740
你呆在这又能有多久呢？
How long do you have if you stay?

446
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:52,300
在狗把警察带到这里以前还有多久?
How long till the dogs lead the cops here?

447
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:54,400
你提的建议都不可取
What you're suggesting is not an option.

448
00:25:54,410 --> 00:25:56,440
听着  我并不想做个英雄或是什么
Look, I ain't trying to be a hero or nothing.

449
00:25:56,450 --> 00:26:00,770
我们都知道现在只有两种情况会发生
We both know there are only two things that can happen now.

450
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:03,740
把我留在这儿
Leave me here...

451
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:07,450
或者两个都被捕
or we both get caught.

452
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:26,940
布鲁斯
Bruce.

453
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:28,000
莎拉
Oh, Sara.

454
00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:29,370
我知道我们说好不用这个号码
I know we said not to use this number

455
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:31,140
但我想知道你是否安全
but I just needed to know you were okay.

456
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:32,840
我司机说他去接你
My driver said he went to pick you up

457
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:34,170
但那里是犯罪现场
and the place was a crime scene.

458
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:36,240
是的  他看到的那个女人 在电话亭边的那个
Yeah, the woman that he saw, the woman by the pay phone

459
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:37,840
本来应该是我
that was supposed to be me.

460
00:26:37,850 --> 00:26:39,500
我  我只能把她留在那儿
And-and I had to leave her there.

461
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:40,740
我不知道该怎么办
I didn't know what to do.

462
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:41,800
布鲁斯  那些是什么人?
Bruce, who are these people?

463
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:43,800
他们清楚的知道我的方位
They knew exactly where I was going to be standing.

464
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:46,770
还知道我要去哪儿...
They knew where I was going to be...

465
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:47,840
莎拉
Sara?

466
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:49,700
是你
It was you.

467
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:51,640
你在说什么  莎拉?
What are you talking about, Sara?

468
00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:53,300
我只是想知道你在哪儿
I just need to know where you are.

469
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:56,410
天啊
Oh, my god.

470
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:24,300
打扰一下
Excuse me

471
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,970
我想看看我们的朋友 LJ  布伦斯怎么样了
we'd like to check on a friend of ours, LJ Burrows?

472
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:28,070
他正在缝合伤口
He's getting some stitches.

473
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,340
我们只是想确定他安然无恙
We just want to make sure he's all right.

474
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:32,070
那他出来的时候你会看见的
And you can see him when he's through.

475
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,270
这是规定
It's policy.

476
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,270
你没搞清楚
You don't get it.

477
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:35,600
我很清楚  那个孩子是在自卫
I get that that kid defended himself.

478
00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:37,740
你打算告诉我们为什么先袭击他吗?
You going to tell us why you attacked him in the first place?

479
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:38,900
-我已经告诉你了 -我知道  有人收买你做的
-I told you man. -I know, some guy paid you.

480
00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:41,070
-有人付钱让我去做的 -打扰一下  FBI
-Some guy paid me to do it. -Excuse me. Fbi.

481
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,140
你说有人付钱让你这么做
What do you mean

482
00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:43,140
此话怎讲？
somebody paid you?

483
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:44,840
见鬼  你觉得听起来会是什么意思?
What the hell does it sound like, man?

484
00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:46,370
有个家伙给了我50美元
Some dude gave me 50 bucks

485
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:49,340
叫我揍那小子一顿
to give the kid a beat down.

486
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:52,950
是布伦斯  他在这儿
It's Burrows. He's here.

487
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:59,300
儿子  你感觉如何?
How you feeling, son?

488
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:02,170
爸爸
Dad?

489
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:06,550
我们得离开这
We got to move.

490
00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:26,950
你知道的  你能做的不多
Well, there's not much you can do, you know.

491
00:28:27,050 --> 00:28:27,970
打扰一下  女士们
Excuse me, ladies.

492
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:29,540
我有几个问题想问你
I need to ask you a few questions.

493
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:31,400
我是跟进调查组的
I'm on the, uh, follow-up investigation team.

494
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:34,710
麻烦一下
Excuse me.

495
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:36,670
我们只是想知道
Uh, we're just curious.

496
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:40,970
你是否看到那些罪犯找到了
Did you see if the convicts actually found

497
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:42,600
他们挖洞想找的东西？
what they were digging for?

498
00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:44,140
没有  不过听上去好像找到了
No.But sure sounded like they did.

499
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:45,400
那个西班牙人
The spaniard

500
00:28:45,410 --> 00:28:48,340
他非常兴奋的拿走了我女儿的一个露营背包
he took off with one of my daughter's camping packs

501
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:50,070
然后扔下其他人走了
and he left the other ones in a real tizzy.

502
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,440
听上去他用暴力手段背弃了他人
Sounded like he screwed 'em over something fierce.

503
00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:53,770
然后他们就那么让他走了？
And-and they just let him leave?

504
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:56,740
他们是很不乐意  不过也没有办法
Well, they weren't happy about it, but, yeah.

505
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:58,470
他开着摩托离开了
He took off on his motorbike

506
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,070
几分钟后其他人也离开了
and then they left a few minutes later.

507
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,370
-一起走的? -不是
-Together? -No.

508
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:04,070
那个帅小伙和那个黑人先离开
The pretty one and the black fellow, they left first

509
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,440
再是那个邋遢的南方人
and then that dirty southerner...

510
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:06,570
他鬼鬼祟祟的从后门走的
he snuck out the back.

511
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:08,170
不过他行动有点缓慢
But he was moving kind of slow, you know

512
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:09,470
一来那个背包很重
the weight of that backpack

513
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,440
二来他本身还有伤残
and that disability that...

514
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:13,040
等等  他也有个背包?
wait a minute, he had a backpack, too?

515
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:14,200
是的
Yes.

516
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:17,100
他又倒回来  在出去的时候
He came back in and slipped this into my brassiere

517
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:19,140
把这个塞进我胸衣里
on his way out.

518
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:24,150
他说用这个来弥补我们的损失
He said it was to cover the damages.

519
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:29,370
我们要保留这个作为证据
Um, we're going to need to keep this as evidence.

520
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:31,230
谢谢合作
Thank you for your time.

521
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:33,740
上车
get the car

522
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:43,540
7 3 6 空格
Seven, three, six, space.

523
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:46,040
3 3 9 空格
Three, three, nine, space.

524
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:49,900
8 6 8 7
Eight, six, eight, seven.

525
00:29:49,910 --> 00:29:51,770
你到底想查什么?
And what exactly are you looking for?

526
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:54,000
图形  代码
A pattern.A code.

527
00:29:54,010 --> 00:29:57,310
任何东西
Anything.

528
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:29,100
是什么迈克尔? 你到底想要告诉我什么?
What? What are you trying to tell me, Michael?

529
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:30,770
听说...
They say...

530
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:34,100
一个人闯入你的生活总会有个理由
people come into your life for a reason.

531
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:39,270
也许我的理由就是帮你离开福克斯河监狱
Maybe my reason was to help you get out of Fox River.

532
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:42,740
帮你救出你哥哥
You know, to help you save your brother.

533
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:46,310
不是的
No.

534
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:54,770
没关系  兄弟
It's okay, papi.

535
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:57,070
不用管我
Let me go.

536
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:59,270
我们现在距离水坝下的小河1/4英里
We're a quarter mile up the river

537
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:02,380
他们就在附近
below the dam.

538
00:31:03,010 --> 00:31:06,580
现在不走就来不及了  迈克尔
It's now or never, Michael.

539
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:11,470
我要你摒住呼吸
I want you to hold your breath.

540
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:12,640
-好不好? -为什么?
-Okay? -Why?

541
00:31:12,650 --> 00:31:13,670
照做就是了
Just do it.

542
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:17,050
我保证马上就回来
I'll be right back, I promise.

543
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:36,940
你在搞什么鬼?
What the hell are you doing?

544
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:39,600
所有单位改道小河
all units to the river.

545
00:31:39,610 --> 00:31:41,100
我要你潜下去
I want you to go under.

546
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:43,840
把手伸出水面  举高
And then stick your arm up, above the water, high.

547
00:31:43,850 --> 00:31:44,900
好
All right.

548
00:31:44,910 --> 00:31:47,540
如果你憋不住了
And then when you start running out of air

549
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:48,770
就前后挥动你的手
wave it back and forth

550
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:50,170
-这样我就能看到 -好
-so I can see it.

551
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:51,370
我就会过来救你
And I'll come back and get you.Okay?

552
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:54,950
明白了? 把你的手给我
All right, give me your hand.

553
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:56,700
1...
One...

554
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:57,870
2...
two...

555
00:32:34,810 --> 00:32:39,350
快点  快点
Come on.Come on!

556
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:19,750
苏克雷
Sucre!

557
00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:26,110
苏克雷
Sucre!

558
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:02,640
说吧
talk to me.

559
00:34:02,650 --> 00:34:03,770
是这样
Well

560
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:05,400
有一个可能
there is one possibility

561
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:07,040
不过可能太简单了
but it's almost too rudimentary.

562
00:34:07,050 --> 00:34:09,300
在看手机键盘的时候
We know we're not looking at a phone number

563
00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:13,810
我们可能根本不会看它的数字
but maybe we're not looking at numbers at all.

564
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:17,040
而是看每个数字上面
What's important are the letters

565
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:22,070
对应的字母
that correspond to that number.

566
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:25,400
3个点  第3个字母
Three dots, third letter

567
00:34:25,410 --> 00:34:26,700
R
"R."

568
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:30,970
2个点...D...E
Two-- "D," "E."

569
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:32,640
每个数字有3种可能
Three possibilities per number.

570
00:34:32,650 --> 00:34:37,370
那就有成千上万种可能
That's thousands of letter combinations.

571
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:42,040
但是只有一种组合是对的
But only one of them's going to be right.

572
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:46,050
(rendezvous:约会地点)
rendezvous pendextoup

573
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:52,650
问题是地点在哪儿
Question is where.

574
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:03,340
你好
Hey.

575

只要能开的车就行
Four wheels and a gas pedal.

577

嗨  皮特 是我
Hey, petey. Uh, it's me.

578
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:12,100
听着  我有点...
Uh, listen

579
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,240
事情要告诉你
I-I got something to tell you.

580
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:15,100
好的  我还在想你什么时候会打电话给我
Yeah, well, I was wondering when you were gonna call.

581
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:20,300
是的  上次见了你之后发生了很多事情...
Yeah, um, a-a lot has come down since we last talked, and, uh...

我知道  我听说了
Gee, I know, I heard.

583
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:23,770
你把它毁了
You ruined it.

584
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:26,340
是的  嗯...
Yeah.

585
00:35:26,350 --> 00:35:27,400
你已经听说了?
you heard already?

586
00:35:27,410 --> 00:35:28,840
老兄  所有人都听说了
Well, brother, everybody's heard, man

587
00:35:28,850 --> 00:35:31,200
让我说些事给你听
and let me tell you something, man.

588
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:32,400
赫克托气坏了
Hector is pissed.

589
00:35:32,410 --> 00:35:34,540
赫克托和这有什么关系?
What does hector have to do with it?

590
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:35,640
那是他的婚礼啊
It was his wedding.

591
00:35:35,650 --> 00:35:37,700
等等  你在说什么?
Wait, man. What are you talking about?

592

你的摩托车啊  你说的又是什么?
Your bike.What are you talking about?

593
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:40,900
婚礼
The wedding.

594
00:35:40,910 --> 00:35:42,000
婚礼怎么了?
What about the wedding?

595
00:35:42,010 --> 00:35:44,400
你知道婚礼中说"我愿意"的那段吧?
Well, you know the part where, uh, you say, "I do"?

596
00:35:44,410 --> 00:35:48,600
玛丽克鲁兹说"我不愿意"
Maricruz said, "I don't."

597
00:35:48,610 --> 00:35:50,170
她真的这么说?
She did?

598
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:51,970
留下赫克托一个人站在圣坛上捧着罐头
Left homeboy standing at the altar holding his spam in his hand

599
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:55,470
如果你明白我在说什么的话
if you know what I'm saying.

600
00:35:55,480 --> 00:36:00,680
你刚才说我的摩托车怎么了?
What were you telling me about my bike?

601
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:04,370
好的
All right.

602
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:06,800
我去拿钥匙给你
I'll go get your keys.

603
00:36:06,810 --> 00:36:08,440
有两站要停
I got a couple stops to make.

604
00:36:08,450 --> 00:36:09,770
第一个地方叫布兰丁
First is this place called Blanding.

605
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:14,140
-然后两天后我们和林肯会合 -我不能走
-Then we'll meet up with Lincoln in a couple days. -I can't go.

606
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:16,670
她说了"我不愿意"  兄弟
She said no, papi.

607
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:19,140
玛丽克鲁兹... 玛丽克鲁兹跟那个兔崽...
Maricruz...Maricruz told that son of A...

608
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:20,470
她跟他说她不愿意

609
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,040
你能相信吗?
Can you believe that?

610
00:36:22,050 --> 00:36:22,900
太棒了
That's great.

611
00:36:22,910 --> 00:36:24,570
我知道
I know.

612
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:26,140
现在
Now

613
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:27,540
我
I just...

614
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:29,900
不  去吧 把她找回来
No. Go on. Get your girl.

615
00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:32,270
那巴拿马呢?  我们说好我们要...

616
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,470
另外找时间吧
Some other time.

617
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:36,500
巴拿马又不会跑掉
Panama's not going to go anywhere.

618
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:38,970
这个  在路上你如果遇到麻烦
This is, uh, in case you run into trouble

619
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:43,110
可以用的上
down the road.

620
00:36:45,850 --> 00:36:49,540
在河里的时候
In the river...

621
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:51,300
我叫你别管我先走的
I told you to leave me behind.

622
00:36:51,310 --> 00:36:52,840
是啊  我试过
Yeah, well, I tried

623
00:36:52,850 --> 00:36:57,250
不过我被绳子缠住了  所以...
but, uh, then I got tangled up in the rope, so...

624
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:02,370

625
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:05,340
谢谢  还有...
Thanks, and, uh

626
00:37:05,350 --> 00:37:10,250
我们还要一辆车
we'll need another car.

627
00:37:14,510 --> 00:37:17,440
你真的认为那个恋童癖拿到了所有的钱?
Do you really think the diaper sniper got all of it?

628
00:37:17,450 --> 00:37:19,000
只有一种办法才能弄清楚
Only one way to find out.

629
00:37:19,010 --> 00:37:21,370
如果你是帝博格  你手上有5百万美元
If you were Bagwell, and you just got your hands on $5 million

630
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:26,310
你会去哪里?
where would you go?

631
00:37:49,450 --> 00:37:52,870
你以为只有你才被别人背叛?
You think you're the only one who feels betrayed?

632
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:55,940
有一天我会从这里出去
I'm gonna get out of here some day.

633
00:37:55,950 --> 00:37:57,470
那时候
And when I do

634
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:04,580
别以为我会忘记你家的前门是什么样子
don't think I won't remember what your front steps look like.

635
00:38:17,610 --> 00:38:19,970
我直说吧
Let me get this straight.

636
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:22,140
是你付钱给那个家伙叫他揍我的?
You-you paid that Meth-Head to whoop my ass?

637
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:23,470
是啊
Yup.

638
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:25,440
联邦调查局的家伙正等着我来接你
Feds were waiting for me to come get you.

639
00:38:25,450 --> 00:38:26,570
这是唯一的办法
It was the only way.

640
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:28,140
-成功了  不是吗? -是啊
-It worked, didn't it? -Yeah

641
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:30,470
是啊  让我缝了四针
it got me four stitches.

642
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,740
增加点个性
Adds character.

643
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:34,340
拿着
Here, take that.

644
00:38:34,350 --> 00:38:35,570
里面有些冰块
There's some ice in there.

645
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:36,700
敷在眼睛上
Put it on the eye.

646
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:40,140
消消肿
Keep the swelling down.

647
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:46,570
我像你这么大的时候也打过一些架
I've been in a few fights in my day, too.

648
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:51,320
太多了
Too many.

649
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:57,230
rendez vous: 约会地点 sundown/hot: 日落旅馆

650
00:39:16,210 --> 00:39:20,910

651
00:39:28,050 --> 00:39:29,640
清理一下
Clean it.

652
00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:33,550
清除所有痕迹  要像她从没回过家一样
Every surface, like she never came home.

653
00:39:58,950 --> 00:40:01,040
在等你从犹他飞回来的间隙里
You know, waiting for your flight from Utah

654
00:40:01,050 --> 00:40:03,340
我稍微有了点空闲
I had a little extra time for due diligence,

655
00:40:03,350 --> 00:40:05,970
于是我决定研究一下的你的过去
so I decided to dig a little deeper on your history

656
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:07,000
要不然还真不知道
or rather lack of one.

657
00:40:07,010 --> 00:40:08,870
开始很简单  家境贫穷
Starts off simple enough.Poor family.

658
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,770
母亲由于家庭暴力离开
Mom leaves, cites spousal abuse.

659
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:12,800
不知何故你爸爸抚养了你
Somehow your dad holds onto custody, and

660
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:14,740
这些儿科医疗记录表明
by the look of these pediatric meds

661
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:17,570
随后四年他像打格陵兰海豹一样地打你
he beats you like a harp seal for the next four years.

662
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:20,100
很大的打击  穷困  虐待儿童   别无选择
Big shock-- poor, abused kid, not a lot of options

663
00:40:20,110 --> 00:40:22,570
他参军了
he joins the military.

664
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:25,100
有什么想问就开门见山吧 别在那喋喋不休
Will there be any actual questions, or is this just a show-and-tell?

665
00:40:25,110 --> 00:40:26,300
好  我有个问题
Okay, I got one.

666
00:40:26,310 --> 00:40:28,370
为什么一个普通的步兵
How does a guy go from infantry grunt

667
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:32,200
作为特别观察员在第一次海湾战争表现平平
with less than stellar marks to the gulf 1, special ops,

668
00:40:32,210 --> 00:40:33,900
却能加入联邦调查局
to the federal bureau of investigations

669
00:40:33,910 --> 00:40:38,270
而且正领导着这个国家 有史以来最大的追捕行动?
leading the largest manhunt this country's ever seen?

670
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,500
我有这些零星线索
I have all these dots.

671
00:40:39,510 --> 00:40:42,170
但是我却不能连系在一起
And there's just no way to connect them.

672
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:45,640
你应该查你职权范围内的事情... 迪克
Looks like you need to work on your clearance level...Dick.

673
00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:47,200
或许我就想查你
Or maybe I just work on you.

674
00:40:47,210 --> 00:40:49,670
-你想这么做? -我要把你锁在这张桌子上
-You want to do this? -I will chain you to this desk

675
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,940
直到我发现我的猜测是错误的
until I get some answers I cannot fertilize my lawn with.

676
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:53,900
你确定你真的要这么做?
You sure you want to do this?

677
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:56,200
我知道他们让你在国外做了什么  亚历克斯
I know what they tell you to do overseas, Alex,

678
00:40:56,210 --> 00:40:58,370
让我把话再说得更清楚点
and let me make it perfectly clear

679
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:00,700
在美国国土上我们不能那样做
we do not do it on American soil.

680
00:41:00,710 --> 00:41:03,600
长官  有电话找你
Sir, uh, there's a phone call for you.

681
00:41:03,610 --> 00:41:05,000
我等一下再接
I'll take it later.

682
00:41:05,010 --> 00:41:09,550
长官  你最好现在就接
Uh, sir, you're gonna want to take this now.

683
00:41:12,850 --> 00:41:15,600
喂
Yeah.

684
00:41:15,610 --> 00:41:17,470
是  长官
Yes, sir.

685
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:19,100
我...
I, uh...

686
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:21,270
我现在就和他在一起
I'm with him now.

687
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:24,070
是 长官
Yes, sir.

688
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:26,210
好
Okay.

689
00:41:30,010 --> 00:41:31,540
你去哪儿?
Where you going, Rick?

690
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:35,240
我想我们应该进入正题了
I thought we were really starting to get somewhere.

691
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:39,410
我们走
Let's go.

692
00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:54,700
亚历克斯
Alex.

693
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:59,750
你有什么给我?
You got something for me?

694
00:42:02,010 --> 00:42:04,940
打开它
open it.

695
00:42:04,950 --> 00:42:07,470
这些数字联系到
The numbers correlate

696
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:09,340
手机上的字母
to the letters on a phone.

697
00:42:09,350 --> 00:42:10,800
只有这个可能
Only on this one

698
00:42:10,810 --> 00:42:13,500
其他组合都说不通
none of the possible combinations make sense.

699
00:42:13,510 --> 00:42:14,640
我们认为这数字对应的是个地点
We think it's a location

700
00:42:14,650 --> 00:42:15,870
迈克尔 斯科菲尔德约定的见面地点
a rendezvous point for Michael Scofield.

701
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:17,000
找到了地点
You find it

702
00:42:17,010 --> 00:42:18,770
就找到了他
you find him.

703
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:20,700
你该快些把我从那里弄出去
You know, you could have gotten me out of there sooner.

704
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:23,370
我们需要通过些渠道
You know, even we have to go through certain channels

705
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:26,300
才能把事情做得看起来可信
to make things appear on the up-and-up.

706
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:28,970
亚历克斯你明白这些  不是吗?
You know all about that, don't you, Alex?

707
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:33,450
保持原样吧
Keeping up appearances.

708
00:42:33,650 --> 00:42:35,000
很好
Good.

709
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:37,800
我只是想确认一下
I was just making sure

710
00:42:37,810 --> 00:42:41,300
你是否还记得这次追捕的目标
that we're still clear on the directive of this manhunt.

711
00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:44,540
我知道...追捕布伦斯和斯科菲尔德的原因
You know, I understand the, uh, reasoning behind Burrows and Scofield,

712
00:42:44,550 --> 00:42:46,740
但是其他人...虽然他们可能是罪犯
but these other men-- criminals that they may be--

713
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:49,370
但是没有证据表明...
there's nothing in their profiles to suggest...

714
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:51,800
你只是被雇佣做事的
you've been hired to do a job.

715
00:42:51,810 --> 00:42:55,100
理由不关你的事
The reasoning does not concern you.

716
00:42:55,110 --> 00:42:57,140
不要问关于我们的问题
Don't ask any questions about us

717
00:42:57,150 --> 00:42:59,270
这样或许我们能继续保证不再有人调查你
and maybe we'll continue to make sure no one asks any questions about you.

718
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:02,410
明白了吗?
Are we clear?

719
00:43:05,310 --> 00:43:09,180
全部都得死
They all die.
