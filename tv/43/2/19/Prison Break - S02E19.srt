1
00:00:06,326 --> 00:00:07,140
Let me get this straight.

2
00:00:07,237 --> 00:00:09,868
The brothers come back to a city
that's 15 miles from the prison

3
00:00:09,915 --> 00:00:11,276
They escaped from--
Why would they do that?

4
00:00:11,358 --> 00:00:12,651
Maybe it's because the
president is in Chicago

5
00:00:12,733 --> 00:00:14,322
To make a speech, and
they're up to something,

6
00:00:14,428 --> 00:00:16,506
Legally speaking, this tape is useless.

7
00:00:16,604 --> 00:00:17,690
So we blackmail her.

8
00:00:17,779 --> 00:00:18,964
In exchange for what?

9
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:21,362
A presidential pardon.

10
00:00:21,666 --> 00:00:23,179
Now, are we gonna
keep crying about money

11
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:24,514
You've already got coming to you?

12
00:00:24,635 --> 00:00:25,978
Or do you want to make some more?

13
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:27,920
I'm listening. Ever been to Mexico?

14
00:00:28,043 --> 00:00:30,538
When's the meal coming
around? I'm starved.

15
00:00:31,138 --> 00:00:33,424
Freshen me up when you
get a chance, darlin'.

16
00:00:33,513 --> 00:00:34,549
Fernando!

17
00:00:34,633 --> 00:00:35,583
Tia!

18
00:00:35,696 --> 00:00:37,721
Tia, ella es Maricruz.

19
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:39,146
I'll check this bag
for you, sir. Oh, no.

20
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,786
That's coming with
me-- Give it back.

21
00:00:41,565 --> 00:00:43,922
Sir, I know that bag is
way over the weight limit.

22
00:00:43,981 --> 00:00:46,461
Sir, your bag will be safe.

23
00:00:47,004 --> 00:00:48,126
They're watching you.

24
00:00:48,197 --> 00:00:49,421
But from where?

25
00:00:49,836 --> 00:00:50,725
There.

26
00:00:50,806 --> 00:00:52,349
President Reynolds ruined
your life; she ruined my life.

27
00:00:52,421 --> 00:00:54,700
You want to take that bitch down?

28
00:00:54,764 --> 00:00:57,908
You just found your inside man,
but it's got to be right now.

29
00:00:57,995 --> 00:01:00,954
Have either of these
men checked in? Yeah.

30
00:01:01,068 --> 00:01:02,282
Room 10-06.

31
00:01:02,372 --> 00:01:03,878
Later today, you'll get
a package in your cell.

32
00:01:03,971 --> 00:01:06,385
It's gonna be from me-- I
need you to use it. Okay?

33
00:01:26,157 --> 00:01:27,428
Open on four!

34
00:01:36,065 --> 00:01:37,462
I need a hand in here!

35
00:01:43,717 --> 00:01:44,516
I need a medic

36
00:01:44,589 --> 00:01:46,922
In B-4! Let me die.

37
00:01:47,049 --> 00:01:48,151
No.

38
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:50,034
Shh!

39
00:01:50,107 --> 00:01:51,146
Let me die.

40
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,729
A large crowd is gathering along

41
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:02,207
Beaumont Avenue here in
downtown Chicago, anticipating

42
00:02:02,263 --> 00:02:04,573
The arrival of President
Caroline Reynolds,

43
00:02:04,664 --> 00:02:06,523
Who continues her speaking
tour today with an appearance

44
00:02:06,604 --> 00:02:08,875
At the Grand Carlisle Hotel.

45
00:02:10,785 --> 00:02:12,488
Inner Circle approaching
the south perimeter.

46
00:02:12,568 --> 00:02:13,633
Marker One.

47
00:02:16,176 --> 00:02:17,543
Marker Two.

48
00:02:20,448 --> 00:02:22,175
Marker Three.

49
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:26,823
Okay.

50
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:32,941
I think you'd better go.

51
00:02:33,221 --> 00:02:35,262
You sure? Yeah.

52
00:02:35,342 --> 00:02:36,262
Thank you for your help,

53
00:02:36,349 --> 00:02:38,348
But, uh, there's nothing
more you can do for us.

54
00:02:38,429 --> 00:02:39,677
It doesn't feel right, just leaving.

55
00:02:39,749 --> 00:02:42,533
I don't think you want any
part of this. Thank you.

56
00:02:46,651 --> 00:02:47,978
It's ten minutes away, right?

57
00:02:48,083 --> 00:02:49,340
At least.

58
00:02:50,818 --> 00:02:53,244
Listen, if this doesn't work,

59
00:02:53,321 --> 00:02:56,227
We're gonna need a
way out-- For good.

60
00:02:56,434 --> 00:02:57,889
Well, that's on you.

61
00:03:00,928 --> 00:03:02,042
Yeah.

62
00:03:02,136 --> 00:03:03,504
What about Derek?

63
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,259
Derek Sweeney? Yeah.

64
00:03:06,715 --> 00:03:08,416
You think he'll be up for this? Yeah.

65
00:03:08,656 --> 00:03:09,879
All right.

66
00:03:10,302 --> 00:03:11,861
This is your neck of the woods.

67
00:03:12,127 --> 00:03:13,486
You want to meet at the park?

68
00:03:14,223 --> 00:03:16,646
Uh... how's Third d Racine?

69
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:18,189
Third and Racine?

70
00:03:18,589 --> 00:03:21,284
Uh... 3:15, the corner.

71
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:22,625
I'll be there.

72
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:25,349
If anything happens

73
00:03:27,132 --> 00:03:28,854
I love you both.

74
00:05:47,998 --> 00:05:49,007
Sit down.

75
00:06:23,342 --> 00:06:25,494
When were they here,
five minutes, ten minutes?

76
00:06:25,797 --> 00:06:26,717
They were never here.

77
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:28,133
No, no, no, they were
here. I know they were here.

78
00:06:28,213 --> 00:06:29,957
Wh-Where did they go?

79
00:06:31,707 --> 00:06:32,715
I don't know.

80
00:06:32,764 --> 00:06:33,939
No, you do know.

81
00:06:34,051 --> 00:06:35,284
He decided it was for the best,

82
00:06:35,339 --> 00:06:37,163
And I couldn't take this anymore.

83
00:06:37,532 --> 00:06:38,994
It's over just like that, huh?

84
00:06:39,053 --> 00:06:41,094
Yeah. It's over like the time

85
00:06:41,141 --> 00:06:43,175
You flew to New Mexico on dead
woman's ID to meet up with him?

86
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,804
Or it's over like the
time that you met up

87
00:06:44,869 --> 00:06:47,267
And got back together at the
train station in Evansville?

88
00:06:47,366 --> 00:06:48,444
Or maybe like the da today,

89
00:06:48,508 --> 00:06:50,284
When you checked into this hotel here

90
00:06:50,341 --> 00:06:52,346
Two hours ago? Which one
is it like, like that?

91
00:06:52,544 --> 00:06:53,631
I don't honestly care
if you believe me or not.

92
00:06:53,698 --> 00:06:54,956
No plans to meet, no phone calls?

93
00:06:55,017 --> 00:06:56,019
I'm telling you the truth.
He's not going to call you?!

94
00:06:56,095 --> 00:06:57,871
D't lie to me.

95
00:06:58,007 --> 00:06:59,302
You don't want to do that.

96
00:07:32,555 --> 00:07:33,178
Excuse me.

97
00:07:33,258 --> 00:07:34,258
Can you tell me what the sign means

98
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:36,016
Over there? I'm just wondering.

99
00:07:36,448 --> 00:07:37,416
No hablo granjero.

100
00:08:09,765 --> 00:08:10,473
Hey!

101
00:08:11,145 --> 00:08:12,168
Hey, hombre!

102
00:08:12,248 --> 00:08:13,303
¿Que haces?

103
00:08:48,148 --> 00:08:50,495
Listen to me, man, it
needs to be today. Shh!

104
00:08:50,576 --> 00:08:52,293
Hey, look, my family is
in trouble, all right?

105
00:08:52,349 --> 00:08:54,717
There's man out there who's
trying to hurt my family.

106
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:55,686
Your family is fine.

107
00:08:55,766 --> 00:08:57,213
There's nobody after your family.

108
00:08:57,457 --> 00:08:58,779
No, look at me, man.

109
00:08:58,915 --> 00:09:00,555
Look, I'm not crazy, okay?

110
00:09:02,276 --> 00:09:03,670
I know the rules.

111
00:09:05,811 --> 00:09:08,601
I wouldn't be asking you
if it wasn't an emergency.

112
00:09:09,164 --> 00:09:12,650
Please, just let me use that phone.

113
00:09:13,818 --> 00:09:15,369
Please.

114
00:09:23,575 --> 00:09:24,448
Agent Lang.

115
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:27,640
Yeah, yeah, I-I need to
speak to Mahone, please.

116
00:09:28,328 --> 00:09:29,399
Can I have him return?

117
00:09:29,494 --> 00:09:32,038
Listen, this is Benjamin Miles Franklin,

118
00:09:32,136 --> 00:09:35,039
And I need to speak
to Mahone right away.

119
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:38,126
It's Franklin for Mahone.

120
00:09:38,214 --> 00:09:39,605
I'll take it.

121
00:09:42,589 --> 00:09:43,533
Mr. Franklin?

122
00:09:43,557 --> 00:09:44,365
This is Agent Wheeler.

123
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:45,508
I don't believe we've met before.

124
00:09:45,573 --> 00:09:48,516
I need to speak to Mahone.

125
00:09:49,158 --> 00:09:50,852
Something I can help you with?

126
00:09:52,819 --> 00:09:54,210
Listen...

127
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,555
I want to leave a message for him.

128
00:09:57,082 --> 00:09:58,411
You tell him...

129
00:09:59,938 --> 00:10:02,682
You tell him that I'll do
what he wants me to do, okay?

130
00:10:02,795 --> 00:10:04,683
I just need a little bit more time.

131
00:10:04,739 --> 00:10:05,986
I'll do it.

132
00:10:06,353 --> 00:10:07,986
Just don't hurt them.

133
00:10:08,826 --> 00:10:09,993
You hear me?

134
00:10:10,075 --> 00:10:11,609
Don't hurt them.

135
00:10:16,024 --> 00:10:17,051
What's up?

136
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,607
Excuse me.

137
00:10:52,089 --> 00:10:53,015
What the-- Are
you crazy, man?

138
00:10:53,087 --> 00:10:54,750
What the hell are you doing
here, man? Keep your voice down.

139
00:10:55,141 --> 00:10:56,327
Keep it down.

140
00:11:02,053 --> 00:11:03,328
How you been?

141
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:06,180
You all right? It's
good to see you, man.

142
00:11:06,203 --> 00:11:07,388
You, too, brother. You, too.

143
00:11:07,892 --> 00:11:09,251
Look, if some of the
guys knew you were here,

144
00:11:09,323 --> 00:11:10,196
They might not be too cool...

145
00:11:10,225 --> 00:11:12,410
Well, I ain't hanging
around; I need a favor.

146
00:11:13,062 --> 00:11:14,011
You owe me.

147
00:11:14,099 --> 00:11:15,939
I-I do. Y-You
know I do.

148
00:11:16,603 --> 00:11:17,596
Look, it's just...

149
00:11:19,238 --> 00:11:20,906
Look, it's just your
situation right now.

150
00:11:21,066 --> 00:11:22,895
I mean, I just had a kid, a baby boy,

151
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:24,359
And I promised Marie...

152
00:11:24,415 --> 00:11:26,104
I didn't come here to cause trouble.

153
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,975
I'm short on friends;
I need to hook me up.

154
00:11:29,191 --> 00:11:31,759
You're the only one who can do
it without the green up front.

155
00:11:31,949 --> 00:11:33,582
I'm serious about this, man.

156
00:11:33,727 --> 00:11:35,093
Here. I need it.

157
00:11:44,365 --> 00:11:45,236
Okay.

158
00:11:45,345 --> 00:11:46,515
I'll give it a shot.

159
00:11:46,995 --> 00:11:48,683
By when? ASAP.

160
00:11:48,837 --> 00:11:50,372
Tomorrow? The next day? Now.

161
00:11:55,307 --> 00:11:57,138
Now.

162
00:12:00,793 --> 00:12:02,113
All right, Linc.

163
00:12:02,682 --> 00:12:04,569
Come with me.

164
00:14:02,927 --> 00:14:04,006
Who saw him go down?

165
00:14:04,094 --> 00:14:05,989
Any press? We got him down pretty quick,

166
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:07,174
But you never know.

167
00:14:07,334 --> 00:14:08,526
Somebody may have gotten a shot.

168
00:14:08,616 --> 00:14:09,573
Chk around.

169
00:14:10,622 --> 00:14:11,518
Confiscate cameras

170
00:14:11,599 --> 00:14:12,652
If you need to.

171
00:14:12,722 --> 00:14:14,861
Put out a statement
before rumors get started.

172
00:14:16,411 --> 00:14:17,996
And get everyone out of here.

173
00:14:18,675 --> 00:14:19,748
Now.

174
00:14:19,812 --> 00:14:21,512
We're still waiting for
the response from Counter...

175
00:14:24,621 --> 00:14:25,609
You and I both know that

176
00:14:25,669 --> 00:14:28,662
This situation requires
us to abandon protocol.

177
00:14:30,054 --> 00:14:31,389
I don't know what you need to tell them,

178
00:14:31,462 --> 00:14:33,309
But I need your men to leave.

179
00:14:34,675 --> 00:14:36,227
Now.

180
00:14:38,331 --> 00:14:39,804
Yes, sir.

181
00:14:46,366 --> 00:14:47,765
Where's your brother?

182
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,345
I need to see the president. Really?

183
00:14:50,703 --> 00:14:52,581
And you think that's a possibility?

184
00:14:52,814 --> 00:14:54,413
She'll want to hear what I have to say.

185
00:14:54,494 --> 00:14:56,175
Oh, I highly doubt that.

186
00:15:02,892 --> 00:15:05,532
The only person you get to talk to

187
00:15:06,509 --> 00:15:08,027
Is me.

188
00:15:09,019 --> 00:15:11,940
And the only way you're going
to live through the next hour

189
00:15:12,292 --> 00:15:14,737
Is if you tell me where
to find your brother.

190
00:15:15,945 --> 00:15:17,626
Okay.

191
00:15:19,706 --> 00:15:20,914
He's in a safe place.

192
00:15:21,018 --> 00:15:22,705
Be more specific.

193
00:15:23,633 --> 00:15:25,259
Specifically...

194
00:15:26,361 --> 00:15:28,688
A place you will never find him.

195
00:15:40,796 --> 00:15:44,168
I had the honor... to attend

196
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:45,359
This country's most prestigious

197
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:46,941
Military academy...

198
00:15:51,371 --> 00:15:52,984
Whose mission it is

199
00:15:53,359 --> 00:15:55,127
To ensure the greatness of this country

200
00:15:55,213 --> 00:15:56,760
And its future leadership

201
00:15:57,112 --> 00:16:02,677
Encouraging patriotism, building a strong moral
foundation and providing the service of men

202
00:16:03,622 --> 00:16:05,452
"Committed to the values of honor,

203
00:16:06,349 --> 00:16:08,299
Freedom and country."

204
00:16:09,612 --> 00:16:14,475
But, first and foremost,
they taught you this.

205
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:34,782
How do you say "cherries" again?

206
00:16:35,535 --> 00:16:37,297
Cereza.

207
00:16:38,024 --> 00:16:40,231
Looks like you have to get more cerezas.

208
00:16:40,839 --> 00:16:42,832
Baby, I just got you 100 pistachios,

209
00:16:42,895 --> 00:16:44,142
With the right amount of salt, too.

210
00:16:44,223 --> 00:16:45,422
Well, it's the combination.

211
00:16:45,503 --> 00:16:46,734
I need both.

212
00:16:47,461 --> 00:16:49,453
Why am I a sucker for you, huh?

213
00:17:08,265 --> 00:17:10,186
What? What's she saying?

214
00:17:10,283 --> 00:17:11,444
That looks like T-Bag.

215
00:17:11,688 --> 00:17:13,200
Shh.

216
00:17:18,601 --> 00:17:20,895
He said he was trying to
steal luggage from the airport,

217
00:17:22,296 --> 00:17:23,038
But...

218
00:17:23,128 --> 00:17:25,294
He's got $5 million. Why would he...?

219
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,973
Unless he doesn't have it.

220
00:17:36,356 --> 00:17:37,877
Unless he lost it there.

221
00:17:37,981 --> 00:17:40,090
Stop it, Fernando. What?

222
00:17:40,413 --> 00:17:41,114
Do you really believe

223
00:17:41,219 --> 00:17:43,090
That that money is at the airport?

224
00:17:44,194 --> 00:17:45,826
Hey, forget it.

225
00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:48,251
Look at what we have together.

226
00:17:48,617 --> 00:17:50,592
Do you really want to risk that?

227
00:17:51,169 --> 00:17:53,671
We have everything that we need.

228
00:17:54,441 --> 00:17:55,809
Except your cerezas.

229
00:17:55,881 --> 00:17:56,983
Right.

230
00:17:58,592 --> 00:18:00,130
I'll be right back.

231
00:18:00,368 --> 00:18:01,896
Fernando...

232
00:18:14,131 --> 00:18:17,468
Hey. I'll be right back.

233
00:18:51,013 --> 00:18:51,910
You got to know it's not

234
00:18:51,993 --> 00:18:54,413
Real hard for me to recognize a junkie.

235
00:18:55,052 --> 00:18:57,019
I'm... I'm... I'm...

236
00:18:57,117 --> 00:18:59,996
I'm saying you don't look so good.

237
00:19:02,893 --> 00:19:04,051
I'm fine.

238
00:19:04,147 --> 00:19:05,427
Yeah.

239
00:19:07,011 --> 00:19:08,914
You mind me asking what you're taking?

240
00:19:10,299 --> 00:19:12,243
Here. You want one?

241
00:19:12,376 --> 00:19:14,181
No, that's okay. Here.

242
00:19:15,826 --> 00:19:17,523
Save it for later.

243
00:19:21,505 --> 00:19:23,088
Varatril.

244
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:28,295
Benzodiazepine's a
hard-Core tranquilizer, man.

245
00:19:28,816 --> 00:19:30,391
You take these every day?

246
00:19:31,774 --> 00:19:33,479
20 milligrams.

247
00:19:35,638 --> 00:19:38,238
You must feel like
you're walking underwater.

248
00:19:39,783 --> 00:19:41,807
I do.

249
00:19:42,196 --> 00:19:43,970
It's very quiet down here.

250
00:19:44,935 --> 00:19:46,097
That's why you started, right?

251
00:19:46,188 --> 00:19:47,551
Peace and quiet.

252
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,462
That's not why you do it
anymore, though, is it?

253
00:19:53,543 --> 00:19:55,279
Now it's the headaches, right?

254
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:57,030
D you probably don't sleep.

255
00:19:58,934 --> 00:19:59,605
And you know

256
00:19:59,694 --> 00:20:01,757
You're going to destroy yourself, right?

257
00:20:04,484 --> 00:20:06,963
I haven't ruled that
out as a possibility.

258
00:20:10,077 --> 00:20:11,901
I hope we hear from your boyfriend.

259
00:20:16,858 --> 00:20:19,385
There's one difference
between me and Agent Mahone.

260
00:20:20,126 --> 00:20:20,784
He doesn't know the value

261
00:20:20,871 --> 00:20:21,685
Of a bird
in the hand--

262
00:20:21,742 --> 00:20:24,020
He just keeps beating and
beating around that bush.

263
00:20:24,336 --> 00:20:26,709
But if you don't give
up Burrows, I don't care.

264
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:32,364
One down, one to go.

265
00:20:32,468 --> 00:20:36,554
I need to talk to Mr. Scofield, Alone!

266
00:21:05,031 --> 00:21:06,751
Madam President...

267
00:21:07,615 --> 00:21:08,774
Could I...

268
00:21:10,489 --> 00:21:12,099
Have a word?

269
00:21:13,895 --> 00:21:15,644
It wouldn't be prudent

270
00:21:15,892 --> 00:21:17,490
For me to leave you
alone with Mr. Scofield.

271
00:21:17,546 --> 00:21:18,695
My men are right outside this door.

272
00:21:18,835 --> 00:21:20,593
I have a right to privacy.

273
00:21:20,683 --> 00:21:24,494
Your rights aren't my first concern.

274
00:21:24,585 --> 00:21:27,855
Do I need to remind you
who you are talking to?

275
00:21:27,935 --> 00:21:29,022
Step outside,

276
00:21:29,128 --> 00:21:32,069
And close the door behind you.

277
00:21:56,642 --> 00:21:59,772
The things you do for your brother.

278
00:22:00,274 --> 00:22:02,165
It's impressive.

279
00:22:02,426 --> 00:22:04,450
I could say the same for you.

280
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:08,274
But I won't.

281
00:22:08,353 --> 00:22:11,633
Bear in mind, your
opinion means little to me.

282
00:22:12,368 --> 00:22:14,162
This tape.

283
00:22:14,761 --> 00:22:16,687
You have it with you?

284
00:22:17,527 --> 00:22:19,099
No.

285
00:22:20,254 --> 00:22:22,631
But I can arrange for you to hear it.

286
00:22:24,759 --> 00:22:29,333
You don't make arrangements
for me, Mr. Scofield.

287
00:22:29,413 --> 00:22:31,844
I have people for that.

288
00:22:32,413 --> 00:22:34,565
I'm not exactly sure what is

289
00:22:34,628 --> 00:22:36,166
On this tape,

290
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:39,612
But I doubt it's of any interest to me.

291
00:22:39,812 --> 00:22:41,133
It's a recorded conversation

292
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:42,843
Between you and your brother.

293
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:44,516
Well, out of millions of conversations

294
00:22:44,643 --> 00:22:47,315
That I had with my brother
during his lifetime...

295
00:22:47,403 --> 00:22:49,347
I'll narrow it down for you.

296
00:22:50,145 --> 00:22:54,729
It was recorded
sometime after his death.

297
00:22:55,976 --> 00:22:57,834
And this

298
00:22:58,097 --> 00:23:00,727
Particular conversation...

299
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:05,151
You might want to keep in the family.

300
00:23:08,488 --> 00:23:10,486
And where is it?

301
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:11,822
20 different copies

302
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:13,901
In 20 different locations.

303
00:23:14,846 --> 00:23:16,406
I can call my brother right now.

304
00:23:17,087 --> 00:23:18,829
He can play it for you.

305
00:23:18,982 --> 00:23:20,362
Not on the phone.

306
00:23:20,645 --> 00:23:22,284
Have him bring it here.

307
00:23:23,492 --> 00:23:24,804
These are the terms.

308
00:23:26,635 --> 00:23:28,682
You can hear it over the phone,

309
00:23:29,635 --> 00:23:31,866
Or you can hear it on the news.

310
00:23:33,633 --> 00:23:35,040
It's up to you.

311
00:23:39,784 --> 00:23:41,216
I know it's why I started.

312
00:23:42,224 --> 00:23:43,697
Started what?

313
00:23:44,336 --> 00:23:45,511
Using.

314
00:23:45,684 --> 00:23:46,736
Same reason as you.

315
00:23:46,832 --> 00:23:49,662
Why, because you had to stay
up all night during residency?

316
00:23:51,494 --> 00:23:53,167
Because the bass player dumped you

317
00:23:53,245 --> 00:23:54,759
In front of the whole sorority?

318
00:23:54,854 --> 00:23:56,875
Yeah, you and I got a lot in common.

319
00:23:57,805 --> 00:23:59,717
I've seen people die, too.

320
00:24:00,748 --> 00:24:02,995
I'm assuming you didn't make them die.

321
00:24:04,261 --> 00:24:06,011
You need help.

322
00:24:06,515 --> 00:24:08,444
Not what I'm looking for.

323
00:24:14,579 --> 00:24:17,610
For your sake, I hope your
boyfriend calls back real soon.

324
00:24:20,442 --> 00:24:21,929
Ah.

325
00:24:40,643 --> 00:24:42,212
¿Tia?

326
00:24:46,234 --> 00:24:48,007
Maricruz?

327
00:24:52,401 --> 00:24:54,079
Where the hell is everybody?

328
00:24:57,782 --> 00:24:59,574
Mami.

329
00:25:03,111 --> 00:25:06,111
Hey... lookie here, good ol' Sucre.

330
00:25:06,268 --> 00:25:07,213
What did you do to them?

331
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:08,606
Where are they? Maricruz!

332
00:25:08,789 --> 00:25:11,005
Hey, hey, hey, hey, keep your cap on.

333
00:25:11,141 --> 00:25:13,435
They're out picking apples
for the Snuffleupagus.

334
00:25:13,509 --> 00:25:15,026
If you ever... Calm down!

335
00:25:15,116 --> 00:25:17,401
They're going to walk
back in here any minute...

336
00:25:17,899 --> 00:25:19,589
Which means trouble.

337
00:25:20,388 --> 00:25:21,973
Now, unless nlu want to see me try out

338
00:25:22,047 --> 00:25:25,565
The new T-20Z on your
bella muchacha, Mari-Poon.

339
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:29,278
...I think you'd better come with me.

340
00:25:35,618 --> 00:25:36,714
Yeah?

341
00:25:37,427 --> 00:25:39,194
Lincoln Burrows?

342
00:25:40,217 --> 00:25:42,011
Caroline Reynolds.

343
00:25:42,641 --> 00:25:43,643
I understand

344
00:25:43,722 --> 00:25:44,945
You have something

345
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,576
For me.

346
00:25:50,969 --> 00:25:52,264
You still there?

347
00:25:52,354 --> 00:25:53,776
Oh, I'm here.

348
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,814
It's good to finally talk to you.

349
00:25:56,661 --> 00:25:59,628
Wish I had the chance
one of those 242 nights

350
00:25:59,682 --> 00:26:01,086
I spent on death row.

351
00:26:01,176 --> 00:26:04,539
Please just play the tape.

352
00:26:13,442 --> 00:26:15,556
It's awful, I know.

353
00:26:16,081 --> 00:26:17,523
But the choice was clear.

354
00:26:17,608 --> 00:26:20,714
You needed to be far
away from all of this.

355
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:21,840
STD I am.

356
00:26:21,882 --> 00:26:23,200
I'm the Isle of Terrence,

357
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,361
Far off to sea.

358
00:26:24,442 --> 00:26:26,609
Look, I'm still here for you.

359
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:30,311
Now, listen to me, don't
dwell on the negative.

360
00:26:30,407 --> 00:26:32,569
Some people deserve to dwell, Caroline.

361
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,646
You know I'm only a phone call away.

362
00:26:35,727 --> 00:26:36,814
Mm-Hmm.

363
00:26:36,897 --> 00:26:38,775
And 3,000 miles.

364
00:26:40,071 --> 00:26:41,454
Do you...

365
00:26:42,621 --> 00:26:43,821
Do you know

366
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:45,565
How cold it is here?

367
00:26:45,654 --> 00:26:48,092
We talked about this, Terrence.

368
00:26:48,182 --> 00:26:51,364
You knew that you would be
lonely, but it's only temporary.

369
00:26:51,397 --> 00:26:53,533
His appeals process has started already.

370
00:26:53,587 --> 00:26:56,891
This is gonna fly by
quicker than your 20s.

371
00:26:57,051 --> 00:27:00,692
And soon the world will
forget all about him

372
00:27:00,811 --> 00:27:02,650
And they'll forget about you, too.

373
00:27:02,707 --> 00:27:03,961
I promise.

374
00:27:04,041 --> 00:27:05,525
But...

375
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:08,767
It's killing me not being able

376
00:27:09,062 --> 00:27:11,869
To see you, sweet Caroline.

377
00:27:11,941 --> 00:27:13,546
I want to see you, too.

378
00:27:13,621 --> 00:27:15,126
But that can't happen right now.

379
00:27:15,231 --> 00:27:17,262
This house is so big.

380
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:19,480
I just think of you...

381
00:27:21,027 --> 00:27:22,827
Lying in bed...

382
00:27:23,443 --> 00:27:24,835
I know. Me, too.

383
00:27:24,916 --> 00:27:25,605
Your warmth...

384
00:27:25,677 --> 00:27:27,140
Your touch.

385
00:27:36,288 --> 00:27:38,137
Was it quick

386
00:27:39,088 --> 00:27:41,272
When he killed himself?

387
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:44,647
It was a lot quicker
than how my father died.

388
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:47,288
They shot him in the back.

389
00:27:48,046 --> 00:27:50,191
He died in my arms.

390
00:27:50,983 --> 00:27:53,367
I just want to know what happened.

391
00:27:55,014 --> 00:27:57,333
Your brother apologized.

392
00:27:58,949 --> 00:28:00,573
He said he was sorry,

393
00:28:00,953 --> 00:28:03,541
And then he blew his brains
out all over the wall.

394
00:28:05,604 --> 00:28:07,339
It was quick.

395
00:28:07,524 --> 00:28:10,163
And it was his decision.

396
00:28:10,588 --> 00:28:13,019
And now it's time for you to make yours.

397
00:28:20,241 --> 00:28:21,426
Nah, nah, nah, man.

398
00:28:21,488 --> 00:28:23,156
I can't do it.

399
00:28:23,248 --> 00:28:24,673
I can't do that.

400
00:28:25,090 --> 00:28:26,409
Yes, you can.

401
00:28:27,272 --> 00:28:29,146
There's nothing to be afraid of.

402
00:28:29,998 --> 00:28:31,797
You don't get it, do you?

403
00:28:32,272 --> 00:28:34,353
You can't stop this guy.

404
00:28:34,762 --> 00:28:36,560
Not without your cooperation, I can't,

405
00:28:36,639 --> 00:28:38,430
But if you talk to me,

406
00:28:39,546 --> 00:28:40,802
If you tell me what's going on,

407
00:28:40,863 --> 00:28:42,844
I can take care of you, okay?

408
00:28:42,913 --> 00:28:45,294
You've got to trust me, Mr. Franklin.

409
00:28:45,502 --> 00:28:47,454
I can help you.

410
00:28:50,006 --> 00:28:51,838
C-Note, right?

411
00:28:52,261 --> 00:28:54,460
Yeah. Whatever, man.

412
00:29:00,018 --> 00:29:01,252
All I need you to do

413
00:29:01,332 --> 00:29:04,522
Is tell me exactly what
Agent Mahone told you.

414
00:29:05,811 --> 00:29:07,110
If you give me Mahone,

415
00:29:07,193 --> 00:29:09,033
I'll give you your life back.

416
00:29:10,109 --> 00:29:12,938
God's been smiling down
on me, I can tell you that.

417
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:14,876
First, I caught up to
Haywire up in Algoma.

418
00:29:14,929 --> 00:29:16,877
He did a swan dive off a grain elevator

419
00:29:16,934 --> 00:29:18,361
Before they could put him away,

420
00:29:18,388 --> 00:29:19,355
But I still get the reward.

421
00:29:19,425 --> 00:29:20,875
Wait, wait, wait. He's dead?

422
00:29:21,069 --> 00:29:22,444
Yep, like a gnat on a Peterbilt.

423
00:29:22,507 --> 00:29:24,163
Hope you don't take
the same route, Sucre.

424
00:29:24,276 --> 00:29:26,068
Oh, hell no, I got
plenty reasons to live.

425
00:29:26,131 --> 00:29:28,027
I hope a few of them are in Fox River.

426
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:29,338
Or maybe, if you play nice,

427
00:29:29,413 --> 00:29:30,603
I'll throw your Maricruz a couple bills

428
00:29:30,666 --> 00:29:32,386
After I turn you in.

429
00:29:32,584 --> 00:29:34,121
How much are you getting for this?

430
00:29:34,203 --> 00:29:35,314
A hundred grand.

431
00:29:35,396 --> 00:29:38,024
I bet you never thought
your ass'd be worth all that.

432
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,442
Wait, wait, wait. Wait.

433
00:29:40,625 --> 00:29:44,976
What if I know where you
can get five million dollars?

434
00:29:47,344 --> 00:29:48,775
You heard me.

435
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:51,430
Where is it?

436
00:29:51,544 --> 00:29:52,992
I could take you there,

437
00:29:53,473 --> 00:29:55,262
If you didn't have to
take me back to the States

438
00:29:55,345 --> 00:29:57,077
And turn me back in.

439
00:29:58,079 --> 00:29:59,788
Where is it?

440
00:30:02,366 --> 00:30:04,094
T-Bag's in town.

441
00:30:05,212 --> 00:30:08,236
I made my commitment a long time ago.

442
00:30:09,212 --> 00:30:10,294
I agreed

443
00:30:10,365 --> 00:30:13,052
To put my country ahead of myself,

444
00:30:13,109 --> 00:30:15,692
Like a mother does for a child.

445
00:30:17,538 --> 00:30:19,650
And I thought

446
00:30:19,941 --> 00:30:22,474
That what I was doing was noble and that

447
00:30:22,531 --> 00:30:24,361
I would be rewarded.

448
00:30:24,418 --> 00:30:25,673
You were wrong.

449
00:30:25,786 --> 00:30:29,319
Don't you see that I'm
a pawn in this, too?

450
00:30:30,481 --> 00:30:34,361
The power that has taken over
this country is like a cancer,

451
00:30:34,443 --> 00:30:36,873
And it will stop at nothing.

452
00:30:37,495 --> 00:30:39,791
It is out of my control.

453
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:41,719
So is this.

454
00:30:41,983 --> 00:30:44,672
Tell me what you want from me.

455
00:30:45,727 --> 00:30:47,654
Uncuff me.

456
00:30:47,823 --> 00:30:48,943
I don't have the keys.

457
00:30:49,016 --> 00:30:51,334
You'll get them. Second,
I want you to arrange

458
00:30:51,411 --> 00:30:53,350
For me to walk away, alone.

459
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:55,333
No surveillance.

460
00:30:56,572 --> 00:30:58,140
Okay.

461
00:30:58,653 --> 00:31:00,429
And finally,

462
00:31:01,421 --> 00:31:05,866
I want a presidential
pardon for me and my brother,

463
00:31:06,035 --> 00:31:09,034
Fully exonerating us of all our crimes.

464
00:31:09,508 --> 00:31:11,873
And I want it, today.

465
00:31:17,743 --> 00:31:20,405
I can't just hand out pardons

466
00:31:20,506 --> 00:31:21,700
To anyone I choose.

467
00:31:21,774 --> 00:31:23,676
There is a process, rules.

468
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:25,330
This is no exception.

469
00:31:25,661 --> 00:31:28,148
A document will be
delivered for your approval

470
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:29,116
Just like any pardon.

471
00:31:29,189 --> 00:31:30,196
You'll sign it

472
00:31:30,275 --> 00:31:32,209
And then file it with
the attorney general

473
00:31:32,289 --> 00:31:34,422
Who'll submit to the
presidential record.

474
00:31:34,499 --> 00:31:35,754
Fine. I will sign

475
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:37,794
Whatever you need me to sign.

476
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:39,210
That's very kind, but we both

477
00:31:39,290 --> 00:31:40,569
Know that's not enough.

478
00:31:40,682 --> 00:31:42,970
What do you want from me?

479
00:31:43,026 --> 00:31:46,184
I will unlock you myself,
walk you out of here.

480
00:31:46,242 --> 00:31:47,710
What, you want me to drive you

481
00:31:47,769 --> 00:31:49,328
To the airport? I guess I'm not

482
00:31:49,384 --> 00:31:52,154
As trusting as I used to be,
especially with paperwork.

483
00:31:52,201 --> 00:31:54,218
It's so easy to lose.

484
00:31:54,343 --> 00:31:55,621
No, I want you to go out

485
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:58,056
There in front of everyone and announce

486
00:31:58,111 --> 00:32:00,702
Our full pardon on live TV.

487
00:32:02,074 --> 00:32:03,828
You're insane.

488
00:32:03,983 --> 00:32:05,213
That is not the way

489
00:32:05,292 --> 00:32:06,549
Things are done.

490
00:32:06,605 --> 00:32:08,485
This is not a vacuum--
People will ask

491
00:32:08,553 --> 00:32:10,048
Questions. Pardon!

492
00:32:10,234 --> 00:32:11,229
On stage.

493
00:32:11,294 --> 00:32:12,489
Now.

494
00:32:16,846 --> 00:32:18,717
And-And how do I know

495
00:32:19,192 --> 00:32:22,783
That you won't release
the tape an hour later?

496
00:32:23,742 --> 00:32:25,212
You don't.

497
00:32:25,716 --> 00:32:28,157
You'll just have to take my word for it.

498
00:32:29,067 --> 00:32:30,767
Well, I need more than that.

499
00:32:30,834 --> 00:32:33,034
Well, you're not going to get it.

500
00:32:37,067 --> 00:32:38,667
Caroline...

501
00:32:38,734 --> 00:32:41,700
It's time.

502
00:32:41,767 --> 00:32:44,067
Make your choice.

503
00:32:50,401 --> 00:32:52,001
Adams, I need you

504
00:32:52,067 --> 00:32:54,001
To uncuff the detainee and bring him

505
00:32:54,067 --> 00:32:56,167
Here to be released.

506
00:32:56,234 --> 00:32:59,301
What are you doing?

507
00:32:59,368 --> 00:33:01,600
Am going to make an announcement

508
00:33:01,667 --> 00:33:04,834
Pardoning Mr. Scofield and
his brother, and he will walk

509
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,401
Away unharmed.

510
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:08,400
Are you out of your mind?

511
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:12,500
He has brought some
indisputable evidence to light.

512
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:13,700
We could end this all

513
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:15,500
Right now.

514
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,500
And you're gonna let them walk?

515
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:21,600
Am the commander in chief,
and you are a corporate lackey.

516
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,300
I am making

517
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,700
The calls now; you have no authority.

518
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:32,052
My men will see to it that
Mr. Scofield walks away

519
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:34,100
Without the interference of you

520
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,800
And your pit bulls.

521
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:09,900
You alone?

522
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:10,700
Yeah.

523
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:14,200
How'd you do?

524
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,700
Three tickets, one cabin, one way.

525
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:17,700
Nice.

526
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,200
I owe you.

527
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:20,700
No, we're even.

528
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,000
These are few you. Nice.

529
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,500
And this.

530
00:34:27,501 --> 00:34:28,299
What's this?

531
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:31,200
Eddie, when he broke out,
bet me a hundred bucks

532
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:32,400
You'd be caught in a week.

533
00:34:32,801 --> 00:34:33,599
I said, "No way.

534
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,700
Not the Linc I know."

535
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:36,400
Figured I'd split it with you.

536
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,800
So this is it, huh?

537
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:42,500
Yeah.

538
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,500
Good luck.

539
00:34:48,201 --> 00:34:48,999
You take care.

540
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,200
You, too. All right.

541
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:52,300
You be safe.

542
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,000
Your neck of the woods.

543
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:19,300
Yeah, how's Third and Racine?

544
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:20,700
I'll be there.

545
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:30,900
I don't want to do this, I really don't.

546
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:34,000
What are you, what
are you talking about?

547
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:35,500
But you can't say that I
didn't give you a choice,

548
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,900
But you, you know, you never

549
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,200
Take the easy way, you...

550
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,700
And I noticed that about you, you...

551
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,500
I didn't expect it to be

552
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:45,600
Any different, but I have a job to do,

553
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:48,000
A job that I'm being made to do.

554
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,400
Pick it up, Sara.

555
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,100
Sara, pick it up.

556
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:57,000
Pick up the phone!

557
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:58,100
Wait, wait!

558
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:01,900
Don't move.

559
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:05,300
Just, uh... don't, don't move.

560
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,500
Okay, I need the phone.
Give me the phone.

561
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:11,600
Stay right where you are,

562
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:12,700
Please.

563
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:16,100
You don't really want to do this.

564
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,800
You don't know the first
thing about what I want.

565
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:37,800
Get my message?

566
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:39,000
Yeah.

567
00:36:42,301 --> 00:36:43,099
I got her.

568
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:43,900
She's on her way out.

569
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:47,500
Follow her; she'll take
you right to Scofield.

570
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:12,100
Sir... we need to talk.

571
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:16,300
In just a few minutes,

572
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,300
The president is going
to announce a pardon

573
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,100
For Burrows and Scofield.

574
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,600
As you're well aware,
this is quite a departure.

575
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,900
She's always been willing to play ball,

576
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
But I think we need to
take some sort of action.

577
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,400
Sir...

578
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:39,144
I hate to disturb you, but I'm
not sure you realize the gravity,

579
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:41,500
Of which she's about to do.

580
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:01,600
Michael.

581
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:04,800
Sara, it worked.

582
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,100
The pardon?

583
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:09,200
She's announcing it any minute.

584
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,100
Oh, my God.

585
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:15,900
Oh... oh, my God.
Michael, that's amazing.

586
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,000
Just get here, okay?

587
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:21,000
I'm on, uh...

588
00:38:22,001 --> 00:38:22,799
Highland.

589
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,000
It's a warehouse. It runs
right down to the water.

590
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,100
Uh, yeah, yeah, I'm on my way.

591
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:07,500
We did it.

592
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,700
Yeah?

593
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:12,100
Um...

594
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,100
What happened to your face, man?

595
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:16,300
If you want to take the ride

596
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,700
You got to buy the ticket.

597
00:39:20,201 --> 00:39:20,999
Yeah, right.

598
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,100
Well, uh, Derek hooked
us up with a cabin

599
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,400
On one of those freighters.

600
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,600
South America via the Great Lakes.

601
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:27,900
We're not going to need that,

602
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,400
But, uh, this is appreciated.

603
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,200
One more time, bro.

604
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:35,000
We did it?

605
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:36,600
It's done.

606
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:38,600
We're done.

607
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
I, uh,

608
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:44,500
I wish I could have seen
the look on her face.

609
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:47,100
No, you don't.

610
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:49,700
Oh, yeah, I do.

611
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:55,900
Unbelievable.

612
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,600
She's going to do it.

613
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,400
Lievable.

614
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:04,700
The president is now
taking the stage here

615
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,500
At the Grand Carlisle Hotel.

616
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,500
The two-Hour delay in her appearance

617
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:10,900
Due to an investigation characterized

618
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,700
By Press Secretary Ryan
Berg as "an overzealous fan."

619
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,500
You are not going to do this.

620
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:24,600
I'm afraid I am.

621
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:26,700
There are some developments
you need to be aware of.

622
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,000
I have made my decision.

623
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:31,100
And I would appreciate
you not second-Guessing me.

624
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:33,300
I don't think you understand.

625
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,900
We know your secrets, too.

626
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:38,800
And we can reveal them just as easily.

627
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,200
You need to ask yourself
who you fear more,

628
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:44,300
Michael Scofield or us?

629
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,000
You got 30 seconds.

630
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:47,800
I won't keep you.

631
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:50,300
The world is waiting.

632
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:51,800
Ten seconds.

633
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:52,900
Ladies and gentlemen,

634
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:54,600
The President of the United States.

635
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:57,500
Nine, eight, seven.

636
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Six, five,

637
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:04,600
Four, three, two, one.

638
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:10,000
Thank you for waiting so
patiently all afternoon.

639
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:14,900
If it were not for the
support of this great state,

640
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,300
My home state of Illinois...

641
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:20,500
Thank you.

642
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:22,600
I would not

643
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:24,000
Be here today.

644
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:26,200
Which is why I have chosen

645
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:30,300
Today to make this very
important announcement.

646
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:33,200
A situation

647
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:35,500
Has recently come to light,

648
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:38,800
And I feel that I must take action.

649
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:42,900
It is my job as president
of this great country

650
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:47,980
To make rational decisions
when I am given facts.

651
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:53,500
Decisions that are best not
for me, but for the people.

652
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:59,200
And so, after much

653
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:03,400
Consideration, I regret to inform you

654
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
That I have been diagnosed

655
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:10,200
With a highly malignant form of cancer.

656
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:18,400
And because of that
reason, I am no longer fit

657
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:22,100
To serve as your commander in chief.

658
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:25,900
In the best interest of this country,

659
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,600
Effective immediately,

660
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:32,100
I am stepping down as president

661
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:34,000
Of the United States.

662
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:43,400
If she ain't the president,
the tape's useless.

663
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:46,100
She can't pardon anyone.

664
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:49,100
We got nothing.

665
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,300
There's only one thing we can do.

666
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:00,100
