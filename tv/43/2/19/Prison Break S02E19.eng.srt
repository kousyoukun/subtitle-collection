Let me get this straight.

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,940
The brothers come back to a city that's 15 miles from 
the prison they escaped from-- why would they do that?

5
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:14,220
Maybe it's because the president is in chicago to make a speech,and they're up to something,

6
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:16,470
legally speaking,this tape is useless.

7
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:17,650
So we blackmail her.

8
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:19,010
In exchange for what?

9
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:21,150
A presidential pardon.

10
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:24,630
Now,are we gonna keep crying about money you've already got coming to you?

11
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:25,830
Or do you want to make some more?  

12
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,880
- I'm listening.  
- Ever been to mexico?

13
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,340
When's the meal coming around? I'm starved.

- I'll check this bag for you,sir.  
- Oh,no.

19
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,840
That's coming with me-- give it back.

20
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:44,420
Sir,I know that bag is way over the weight limit.

21
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:46,750
Sir,your bag will be safe.

22
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:48,040
They're watching yoU.

23
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:50,470
But from where? There.

24
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,430
President reynolds ruined your life; she ruined my life.

00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,110
Yes,sir.

166
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:47,740
Where's your brother?

167
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,060
I need to see the president.

168
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:49,980
Really?

169
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,340
And you think that's a possibility?

170
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,150
She'll want to hear what I have to say.

171
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,990
Oh,I highly doubt that.

172
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:05,330
The only person you get to talk to.

173
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:08,230
is me.

174
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:11,720
And the only way you're going to live through the next hour 

175
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,980
is if you tell me where to find your brother.

176
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:17,420
Okay.

177
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:22,250
- He's in a safe place.  
- Be more specific.

178
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:25,190
Specifically.

179
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:28,740
a place you will never find him.

180
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:42,270
I had the honor.

181
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,210
to attend this country's most prestigious military academy.

182
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:56,510
whose mission it is "to educate,encourage,"***

183
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,070
*****

184
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:02,760
building a strong****** man

185
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:05,740
"committed to the values of honor,

186
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:08,190
freedom and country." 

187
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:12,900
But,first and foremost,

188
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:14,640
they taught you this.

189
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,390
RIO JUAREZ MEXICO

190
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:34,910
how do you say "cherries" again?

191
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:37,360
Cereza.

192
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,270
Looks like you have to get more cerezas.

193
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:43,890
Baby,I just got you 100 pistachios,with the right amount of salt,too.

194
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,280
Well,it's the combination.

195
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:46,560
I need both.

196
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:49,270
Why am I a sucker for you,huh?

197
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:51,920
*********

198
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:55,620
dolo*****

199
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:08,130
*******

200
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:09,350
what?

201
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:12,230
- What's she saying?  
- That looks like t-bag.

202
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:21,170
He said he was trying to steal luggage from the airport,but.

203
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:25,340
he's got $5 million.Why would he.

204
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,310
Unless he doesn't have it.

205
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:37,750
Unless he lost it there.

206
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,870
- Stop it,fernando. 
- What?

207
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:42,550
Do you really believe that that money is at the airport?

208
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:45,730
Hey,forget it.

209
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:48,020
Look at at we have together.

210
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:50,510
Do you really want to risk that?

211
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:53,770
We have everything that we need.

212
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:56,170
- Except your cerezas.  
- Right.

213
00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:00,050
I'll be right back.

214
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,400
Fernando.

215
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:17,640
I'll be right back.

216
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:54,250
You got to know it's not real hard for me to recognize a junkie.

217
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:56,650
I'M...I'M.

218
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:00,050
I'm saying  you don't look so good.

219
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:04,130
I'm fine.

220
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:09,150
You mind me asking what you're taking?

221
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,160
Here.You want one?

222
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:13,900
No,that's okay.

223
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:17,290
Save it for later.

224
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:23,150
Varatril.

225
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:28,450
Benzodiazepine's a hard-core tranquilizer,man.

226
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,530
You take these every day?

227
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:33,600
20 milligrams.

228
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:38,130
You must feel like you're walking underwater.

229
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:41,310
I do.

230
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:44,180
It's very quiet down here.

231
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:45,990
That's why you started,right?

232
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,650
Peace and quiet.

233
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:50,830
That's not why you do it anymore,though,is it?

234
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:55,020
Now it's the headaches,right?

235
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:56,830
And you probably don't sleep.

236
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:01,620
And you know you're going to destroy yourself,right?

237
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:07,020
I haven't ruled that out as a possibility.

238
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:12,080
I hope we hear from your boyfriend.

239
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:19,160
there's one difference between me and agent mahone.

240
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,530
He doesn't know the value of a bird in the hand-- 

241
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:23,790
he just keeps beating and beating around that bush.

242
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:26,800
But if you don't give up burrows,I don't care.

243
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,180
One down,one to go.

244
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:34,930
I need to talk to mr.Scofield.

245
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,730
AlonE.

246
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,500
madam president.

247
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:08,790
could I.

248
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,980
have a word?

249
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:16,830
It wouldn't be prudent for me to leave you alone with mr.Scofield.

250
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:19,090
My men are right outside this door.

251
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,460
I have a right to privacy.

252
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:24,310
Your rights aren't my first concern.

253
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:27,320
Do I need to remind you who you are talking to?

254
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:31,940
Step outside,and close the door behind you.

255
00:21:56,430 --> 00:21:59,230
the things you do for your brother.

256
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:02,090
It's impressive.

257
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:04,530
I could say the same for you.

258
00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:08,080
but I won'T.

259
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:11,270
Bear in mind,your opinion means little to me.

260
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:13,890
This tape.

261
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,550
You have it with you?

262
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:19,200
No.

263
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,660
But I can arrange for you to hear it.

264
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:29,030
you don't make arrangements for me,mr.Scofield.

265
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:31,380
I have people for that.

266
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:35,640
I'm not exactly sure what is on this tape,

267
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:39,390
but I doubt it's of any interest to me.

268
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:42,670
It's a recorded conversation between you and your brother.

269
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:47,030
Well,out of millions of conversations that I had with my brother during his lifetime.

270
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,030
I'll narrow it down for you.

271
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:54,490
It was recorded sometime after his death.

272
00:22:55,860 --> 00:23:00,050
And this particular conversation.

273
00:23:02,930 --> 00:23:05,370
you might want to keep in the family.

274
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:10,240
And where is it?

275
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:13,720
20 different copies in 20 different locations.

276
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:16,570
I can call my brother right now.

277
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,830
He can play it for you.

278
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,360
Not on the phone.

279
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:22,440
Have him bring it here.

280
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:25,230
These are the terms.

281
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:28,340
You can hear it over the phone,

282
00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:31,810
or you can hear it on the news.

283
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:35,360
It's up to you.

284
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,520
I know it's why I started.

285
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:43,730
Started what?

286
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:46,430
Using.Same reason as you.

287
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:49,380
Why,because you had to stay up all night during residency?

288
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:54,580
because the bass player dumped you in front of the whole sorority?

289
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:57,030
Yeah,you and I got a lot in common.

290
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,820
I've seen people die,too.

291
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:02,950
I'm assuming you didn't make them die.

292
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:05,790
You need help.

293
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:08,300
Not what I'm looking for.

294
00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:17,290
For your sake,I hope your boyfriend calls back real soon.

295
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:42,380
ia?

296
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:47,900
Maricruz?

297
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:54,380
Where the hell is everybody?

298
00:24:57,850 --> 00:24:59,270
mami.

299
00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:05,920
lookie here,good ol' sucre.

300
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:07,060
What did you do to them?

301
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:07,930
Where are they? Maricruz!

302
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:10,840
Hey,hey,hey,hey,keep your cap on.

303
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:13,210
They're out picking apples for the snuffleupagus.

304
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,920
- If you ever.  
- calm down!

305
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:16,770
They're going to walk back in here any minute.

306
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:19,420
which means trouble.

307
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:25,590
Now,unless you want to see me try out the new t-20z on your  bella muchacha,mari-poon.

308
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:28,960
I think you'd better come with me.

309
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:39,460
Lincoln burrows?

310
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,910
Caroline reynolds.

311
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:46,010
I understand you have something for me.

312
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:52,130
You still there?

313
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:53,330
Oh,I'm here.

314
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:55,510
It's good to finally talk to you.

315
00:25:56,600 --> 00:26:00,960
Wish I had the chance one of those 242 nights I spent on death row.

316
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:04,200
Please just play the tape.

317
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:15,090
It's awful,I know.

318
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:17,500
But the choice was clear.

319
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:20,460
You needed to be far away from all of this.

320
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:21,610
I am.

321
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:24,180
I'm the isle of terrence,far off to sea.

322
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:26,130
Look,I'm still here for you.

323
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:30,170
Now,listen to me,don't dwell on the negative.

324
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:32,480
Some people deserve to dwell,caroline.

325
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:35,560
You know I'm only a phone call away.

326
00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:38,490
And 3,000 miles.

327
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,440
Do you.

328
00:26:42,650 --> 00:26:45,430
do you know how cold it is here?

329
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,700
We talked about this,terrence.

330
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:51,220
You knew that you would be lonely,but it's only temporary.

331
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:53,490
His appeals process has started already.

332
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:56,340
This is gonna fly by quicker than your 20s.

333
00:26:56,930 --> 00:27:00,320
And soon the world will forget all about him 

334
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,460
and they'll forget about you,too.

335
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:03,700
I promise.

336
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:05,130
But.

337
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:11,640
it's killing me not being able to see you,sweet caroline.

338
00:27:11,650 --> 00:27:13,350
I want to see you,too.

339
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,850
But that can't happen right now.

340
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:17,200
This house is so big.

341
00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:19,000
I just think of you.

342
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,560
lying in bed.

343
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:24,740
I know.Me,too.

344
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:26,920
Your warmth.your touch.

345
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:41,100
Was it quick when he killed himself?

346
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:44,630
It was a lot quicker than how my father died.

347
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,950
They shot him in the back.

348
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:49,920
He died in my arms.

349
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:53,250
I just want to know what happened.

350
00:27:54,930 --> 00:27:56,970
Your brother apologized.

351
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,790
He said he was sorry,

352
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:03,590
and then he blew his brains out all over the wall.

353
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:07,260
It was quick.

354
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:09,810
And it was his decision.

355
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:12,880
And now it's time for you to make yours.

356
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:21,320
nah,nah,nah,man.

357
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:23,000
I can't do it.

358
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:24,530
I can't do that.

359
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:26,430
Yes,you can.

360
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:29,130
There's nothing to be afraid of.

361
00:28:29,930 --> 00:28:31,780
You don't get it,do you?

362
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:34,180
You can't stop this guy.

363
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:36,410
Not without your cooperation,I can't,

364
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:38,080
but if you talk to me,

365
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:42,380
if you tell me what's going on,I can take care of you,okay?

366
00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:44,850
You've got to trust me,mr.Franklin.

367
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:47,060
I can help you.

368
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:51,290
C-note,right?

369
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:54,150
yeah Whatever,man.

370
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:04,370
All I need you to do is tell me exactly what agent mahone told you.

371
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:09,280
If you give me mahone,I'll give you your life back.

372
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:12,810
God's been smiling down on me,I can tell you that.

373
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:15,080
First,I caught up to haywire up in algoma.

374
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:17,630
He did a swan dive off a grain elevator before they could put him away,

375
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,180
but I still get the reward.

376
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:20,740
Wait,wait,wait.He's dead?

377
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:22,460
Yep,like a gnat on a peterbilt.

378
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:23,910
Hope you don't take the same route,sucre.

379
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,750
Oh,hell no,I got plenty reasons to live.

380
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,870
I hope a few of them are in fox river.

381
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:32,390
Or maybe,if you play nice,I'll throw your maricruz a couple bills after I turn you in.

382
00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:34,120
How much are you getting for this?

383
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:35,290
A hundred grand.

384
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:37,980
I bet you never thought your ass'd be worth all that.

385
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:39,050
Wait,wait,wait.

386
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:44,520
What if I know where you can get five million dollars?

387
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:49,050
You heard me.

388
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,140
Where is it?

389
00:29:51,150 --> 00:29:52,580
I could take you there,

390
00:29:53,370 --> 00:29:56,520
if you didn't have to take me back to the states and turn me back in.

391
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,770
Where is it?

392
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:04,170
T-bag's in town.

393
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:07,860
I made my commitment a long time ago.

394
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:12,930
I agreed to put my country ahead of myself,

395
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:15,270
like a mother does for a child.

396
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:24,070
And I thought that what I was doing was noble and that I would be rewarded.

397
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,540
You were wrong.

398
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:29,120
Don't you see that I'm a pawn in this,too?

399
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:36,500
The power that has taken over this country is like a cancer,d it will stop at nothing.

400
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:39,580
It is out of my control.

401
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:41,310
So is this.

402
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,770
Tell me what you want from me.

403
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,530
Uncuff me.

404
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:49,890
- I don't have the keys.  
- You'll get them.

405
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:53,050
Second,I want you to arrange for me to walk away,alone.

406
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:55,100
No surveillance.

407
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,730
Okay.

408
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,040
And finally,

409
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:05,630
want a presidential pardon for me and my brother,

410
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:08,830
fully exonerating us of all our crimes.

411
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:12,010
And I want it today.

412
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:21,510
I can't just hand out pardons to anyone I choose.

413
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,480
There is a process,rules.

414
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:24,930
This is no exception.

415
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:28,980
A document will be delivered for your approval just like any pardon.

416
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:32,260
You'll sign it and then file it with the attorney general 

417
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:34,210
who'll submit to the presidential record.

418
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:37,690
Fine.I will sign whatever you need me to sign.

419
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:40,010
That's very kind,but we both know that's not enough.

420
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:42,810
What do you want from me?

421
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:46,060
I will unlock you myself,walk you out of here.

422
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:48,680
What,you want me to drive you to the airport?

423
00:31:48,690 --> 00:31:52,030
I guess I'm not as trusting as I used to be,especially with paperwork.

424
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,810
It's so easy to lose.

425
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:57,010
No,I want you to go out there in front of everyone 

426
00:31:57,220 --> 00:32:00,770
and announce our full pardon on live tv.

427
00:32:02,050 --> 00:32:03,470
you're insane.

428
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:06,350
That is not the way things are done.

429
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:09,160
This is not a vacuum-- 
people will ask questions.

430
00:32:09,170 --> 00:32:10,130
Pardon! On stage.Now.

431
00:32:16,610 --> 00:32:22,070
And-and how do I know that you won't release the tape an hour later?

432
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,050
You don'T.

433
00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:27,820
You'll just have to take my word for it.

434
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:30,810
Well,I need more than that.

435
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:32,850
Well,you're not going to get it.

436
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:38,920
Caroline.

437
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:41,500
it's time.

438
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:44,390
Make your choice.

439
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:55,650
Adams,I need you to uncuff the detainee and bring him here to be released.

440
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,340
What are you doing?

441
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:03,790
I am going to make an announcement pardoning mr.Scofield and his brother,

442
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:06,240
and he will walk away unharmed.

443
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:08,280
are you out of your mind?

444
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:12,520
He has brought some indisputable evidence to light.

445
00:33:12,530 --> 00:33:15,760
We could end this all right now.

446
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:17,570
And you're gonna let them walk?

447
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:22,200
Am the commander in chief,and you are a corporate lackey.

448
00:33:22,390 --> 00:33:26,130
I am making the calls now; you have no authority.

449
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:31,120
My men will see to it that mr.Scofield 

450
00:33:31,130 --> 00:33:35,990
walks away without the interference of you and your pit bulls.

451
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,670
- you alone?  
- Yeah.

452
00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:14,180
How'd you do?

453
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:16,850
Three tickets,one cabin,one way.

454
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:17,730
Nice.

455
00:34:18,370 --> 00:34:19,530
I owe you.

456
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:21,220
No,we're even.

457
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,950
- These are few you.  
- Nice.

458
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:24,930
And this.

459
00:34:27,770 --> 00:34:28,320
What's this?

460
00:34:28,330 --> 00:34:30,480
Eddie,when he broke out,

461
00:34:30,490 --> 00:34:32,720
bet me a hundred bucks you'd be caught in a week.

462
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:35,050
I said,"no way.Not the linc I know." 

463
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:36,940
Figured I'd split it with you.

464
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:41,140
So this is it,huh?

465
00:34:44,450 --> 00:34:45,910
Good luck.

466
00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:49,420
- You take care.  
- You,too.

467
00:34:49,430 --> 00:34:50,730
All right.

468
00:34:51,110 --> 00:34:52,600
You be safe.

469
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:18,040
Your neck of the woods.

470
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:19,460
Yeah,how's third and racine?

471
00:35:19,470 --> 00:35:20,740
I'll be there.

472
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,990
I don't want to do this,I really don'T.

473
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:33,980
What are you,what are you talking about?

474
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:35,840
But you can't say that I didn't give you a choice,but you,

475
00:35:35,850 --> 00:35:38,260
you know,you never take the easy way,you.

476
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:40,730
and I noticed that about you,you.

477
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:43,850
I didn't expect it to be any different,

478
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:45,720
but I have a job to do,

479
00:35:45,730 --> 00:35:48,120
a job that I'm being made to do.

480
00:35:51,470 --> 00:35:52,910
pick it up,sara.

481
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,610
Sara,pick it up.

482
00:35:56,110 --> 00:35:58,070
- Pick up the phone!  
- Wait,wait!

483
00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:02,210
Don't move.

484
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:03,870
Just,uh.

485
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:05,510
don't,don't move.

486
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,700
Okay,I need the phone.Give me the phone.

487
00:36:10,490 --> 00:36:12,710
Stay right where you are,please.

488
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:15,980
You don't really want to do this.

489
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:18,230
You don't know the first thing about what I want.

490
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,200
get my message?

491
00:36:42,410 --> 00:36:42,940
I got her.

492
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:44,130
She's on her way out.

493
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:47,780
Follow her; she'll take you right to scofield.

494
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,950
SiR.

495
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:12,570
we need to talk.

496
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:21,050
In just a few minutes,the president is going to announce a pardon for burrows and scofield.

497
00:37:21,730 --> 00:37:24,070
As you're well aware,this is quite a departure.

498
00:37:25,350 --> 00:37:29,240
She's always been willing to play ball,but I think we need to take some sort of action.

499
00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:32,140
Sir.

500
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:36,100
I hate to disturb you,

501
00:37:37,110 --> 00:37:41,680
but I'm not sure you realize the gravity of what she's about to do.

502
00:38:00,850 --> 00:38:01,800
michael.

503
00:38:01,810 --> 00:38:04,960
Sara,it worked.

504
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,580
The pardon?

505
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,530
She's announcing it any minute.

506
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,410
Oh,my god.

507
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:14,670
oh,my god.

508
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:16,210
Michael,that's amazing.

509
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,160
Just get here,okay?

510
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:21,100
I'm on,uh.

511
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:23,460
highland.It's a warehouse.

512
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:25,380
It runs right down to the water.

513
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:27,420
Uh,yeah,yeah,I'm on my way.

514
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:08,140
we did it.

515
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:14,530
what happened to your face,man?

516
00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:16,580
If you want to take the ride.

517
00:39:18,090 --> 00:39:19,880
you got to buy the ticket.

518
00:39:20,510 --> 00:39:21,600
Yeah,right.Well,uh,

519
00:39:21,930 --> 00:39:24,570
derek hooked us up with a cabin on one of those freighters.

520
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,720
South america via the great lakeS.

521
00:39:26,890 --> 00:39:28,790
We're not going to need that,but,uh,

522
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:31,630
this is appreciated.

523
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:33,420
One more time,bro.

524
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:35,510
We did it?

525
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,730
It's done.

526
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:39,030
We're done.

527
00:39:42,690 --> 00:39:44,720
I wish I could have seen the look on her face.

528
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:47,850
No,you don'T.

529
00:39:48,610 --> 00:39:50,050
Oh,ye,I do.

530
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:56,400
Unbelievable.

531
00:39:56,410 --> 00:39:57,780
She's going to do it.

532
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:00,640
Unbelievable.

533
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:06,430
The president is now taking the stage here at the grand carlisle hotel.

534
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:10,820
The two-hour delay in her appearance  due to an investigation  characterized  

535
00:40:10,830 --> 00:40:14,740
by press secretary ryan berg as "an overzealous fan." 

536
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:23,500
You are not going to do this.

537
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:24,610
I'm afraid I am.

538
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:26,630
There are some developments you need to be aware of.

539
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,110
I have made my decision.

540
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:31,080
And I would appreciate you not second-guessing me.

541
00:40:31,490 --> 00:40:33,280
I don't think you understand.

542
00:40:33,290 --> 00:40:34,960
We know your secrets,too.

543
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:39,130
And we can reveal them just as easily.

544
00:40:39,650 --> 00:40:42,580
You need to ask yourself who you fear more,michael scofield 

545
00:40:43,390 --> 00:40:44,860
or us?

546
00:40:44,870 --> 00:40:46,220
You got 30 seconds.

547
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:48,220
I won't keep you.

548
00:40:49,310 --> 00:40:50,680
The world is waiting.

549
00:40:50,690 --> 00:40:51,920
Ten seconds.

550
00:40:51,930 --> 00:40:54,670
Ladies and gentlemen,the president of the united states.

551
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:57,850
Nine,eight,seven.

552
00:40:57,860 --> 00:41:01,660
Six,five,four,

553
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:05,170
three,two,one.

554
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:10,000
Thank you for waiting so patiently all afternoon.

555
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:14,840
If it were not for the support of this great state,

556
00:41:14,850 --> 00:41:17,730
my home state of illinois.

557
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:23,990
I would not be here today.

558
00:41:24,490 --> 00:41:30,760
Which is why I have chosen today to make this very important announcement.

559
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:35,470
A situation has recently come to light,

560
00:41:35,830 --> 00:41:38,880
and I feel that I must take action.

561
00:41:39,310 --> 00:41:43,040
It is my job as president of this great country 

562
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:48,550
to make rational decisions when I am given facts.

563
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:54,000
Decisions that are best not for me,but for the people.

564
00:41:56,470 --> 00:42:00,780
And so,after much consideration,

565
00:42:01,470 --> 00:42:04,000
I regret to inform you 

566
00:42:04,990 --> 00:42:10,410
that I have been diagnosed with a highly malignant form of cancer.

567
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:16,810
and because of that reason,

568
00:42:17,210 --> 00:42:22,330
I am no longer fit to serve as your commander in chief.

569
00:42:23,930 --> 00:42:27,730
In the best interest of this country,effective immediately,

570
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:34,320
I am stepping down as president of the united states.

571
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:43,920
If she ain't the president,the tape's useless.

572
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:46,550
She can't pardon anyone.

573
00:42:48,090 --> 00:42:49,840
We got nothing.

574
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:56,890
There's only one thing we can do.

575
00:42:58,820 --> 00:43:00,610
We got to disappear.

576
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:03,520
forever.

577
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:06,500


578
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
