00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:02,210
Let me get this straight.

3
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:06,040
The brothers come back to a city that's 15 miles from
the prison they escaped from-- why would they do that?

4
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:09,320
Maybe it's because the president is in chicago to make a speech,and they're up to something,

5
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:11,570
legally speaking,this tape is useless.

6
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:12,750
So we blackmail her.

7
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:14,110
In exchange for what?

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,250
A presidential pardon.

9
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,730
Now,are we gonna keep crying about money you've already got coming to you?

10
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:20,930
Or do you want to make some more?

11
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:22,980
- I'm listening.
- Ever been to mexico?

12
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:25,440
When's the meal coming around? I'm starved.

13
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:28,290
Freshen me up when you get a chance,darlin'.

14
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:29,570

15
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:30,550
Tia!

16
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:32,740
Tia,ella es maricruz.

17
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:33,850
- I'll check this bag for you,sir.
- Oh,no.

18
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:35,940
That's coming with me-- give it back.

19
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:39,520
Sir,I know that bag is way over the weight limit.

20
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:41,850
Sir,your bag will be safe.

21
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:43,140
They're watching yoU.

22
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:45,570
But from where? There.

23
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:48,530
President reynolds ruined your life; she ruined my life.

24
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:49,780
You want to take  that bitch down?

25
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:52,390
You just found your inside man,
but it's got to be right now.

26
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,730
Have either of these men checked in?

27
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:57,230
Yeah.Room 10-06.

28
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:58,820
Later today,you'll get a package in your cell.

29
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:01,310
It's gonna be from me--
I need you to use it.Okay?

30
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:22,690
open on four!

31
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,610
I need a hand in here!

32
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:41,320
I need a medic in b-4!

33
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,110
Let me die.

34
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:56,540
A large crowd  is gathering along  beaumont avenue here in  downtown chicago,

35
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:59,520
anticipating  the arrival  of president caroline reynolds,

36
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:03,780
who continues her speaking tour  today with an appearance  at the grand carlisle hotel.

You sure?

43
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:31,850
Thank you for your help,but,

44
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,390
uh,there's nothing more you can do for us.

45
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,710
It doesn't feel right,just leaving.

46
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,190
I don't think you want any part of this.Thank you.

47
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:42,950
It's ten minutes away,right?

48
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,170

00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:48,230

57
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,050

When were they here,five minutes,ten minutes?

70
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,670
They were never here.

71
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,130
No,no,no,they were here.I know they were here.

72
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:24,630
Wh-where did they go?

No,you do know.

He decided it was for the best,

76
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:32,480
and I couldn't take this anymore.

77
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:34,160
It's over just like that,huh?

78
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:38,480
It's over like the time you flew to new mexico on dead woman's id to meet up with him?

79
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:42,350
Or it's over like the time that you met up and got back together at the train station in evansville?

80
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:46,070
Or maybe like the day,today,when you checked into this hotel here two hours ago?

81
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,600
- Which one is it like,like that?
- I don't honestly care if you believe me or not.

00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:49,970
- No plans to meet,no phone calls?
- I'm telling you the truth.

83
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:51,040
He's not going to call you?

Don't lie to me.

You don't want to do that.

Yes,sir.

165
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:43,740
Where's your brother?

166
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,060
I need to see the president.

167
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:45,980
Really?

168
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,340
And you think that's a possibility?

169
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,150
She'll want to hear what I have to say.

170
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,990
Oh,I highly doubt that.

171
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:01,330
The only person you get to talk to.

172
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:04,230
is me.

173
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:07,720
And the only way you're going to live through the next hour

174
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,980
is if you tell me where to find your brother.

175
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:13,420
Okay.

176
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:18,250
- He's in a safe place.
- Be more specific.

177
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:21,190
Specifically.

178
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:24,740
a place you will never find him.

179
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:38,270
I had the honor.

180
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,210
to attend this country's most prestigious military academy.

181
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:52,510
whose mission it is "to educate,encourage,"***

182
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,070
*****

183
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:58,760
building a strong****** man

184
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:01,740
"committed to the values of honor,

185
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:04,190
freedom and country."

186
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:08,900
But,first and foremost,

187
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,640
they taught you this.

188
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,390
RIO JUAREZ MEXICO

189
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:30,910
how do you say "cherries" again?

190
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,360
Cereza.

191
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,270
Looks like you have to get more cerezas.

192
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:39,890
Baby,I just got you 100 pistachios,with the right amount of salt,too.

193
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,280
Well,it's the combination.

194
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:42,560
I need both.

195
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:45,270
Why am I a sucker for you,huh?

196
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:05,350
what?

197
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:08,230
- What's she saying?
- That looks like t-bag.

198
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:17,170
He said he was trying to steal luggage from the airport,but.

199
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:21,340
he's got $5 million.Why would he.

200
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,310
Unless he doesn't have it.

201
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:33,750
Unless he lost it there.

202
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,870
- Stop it,fernando.
- What?

203
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:38,550
Do you really believe that that money is at the airport?

204
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:41,730
Hey,forget it.

205
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:44,020
Look at at we have together.

206
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:46,510
Do you really want to risk that?

207
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:49,770
We have everything that we need.

208
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:52,170
- Except your cerezas.
- Right.

209
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:56,750
I'll be right back.

210
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:58,100
Fernando.

211
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:14,340
I'll be right back.

212
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:51,250
You got to know it's not real hard for me to recognize a junkie.

213
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:53,650
I'M...I'M.

214
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,050
I'm saying  you don't look so good.

215
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:01,130
I'm fine.

216
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:06,150
You mind me asking what you're taking?

217
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,160
Here.You want one?

218
00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:10,900
No,that's okay.

219
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:14,290
Save it for later.

220
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:20,150
Varatril.

221
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:25,450
Benzodiazepine's a hard-core tranquilizer,man.

222
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:27,530
You take these every day?

223
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:30,600
20 milligrams.

224
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:35,130
You must feel like you're walking underwater.

225
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:38,310
I do.

226
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:41,180
It's very quiet down here.

227
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:42,990
That's why you started,right?

228
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,650
Peace and quiet.

229
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:47,830
That's not why you do it anymore,though,is it?

230
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:52,020
Now it's the headaches,right?

231
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:53,830
And you probably don't sleep.

232
00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:58,620
And you know you're going to destroy yourself,right?

233
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:04,020
I haven't ruled that out as a possibility.

234
00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:09,080
I hope we hear from your boyfriend.

235
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:16,160
there's one difference between me and agent mahone.

236
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,530
He doesn't know the value of a bird in the hand--

237
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:20,790
he just keeps beating and beating around that bush.

238
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:23,800
But if you don't give up burrows,I don't care.

239
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,180
One down,one to go.

240
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:31,930
I need to talk to mr.Scofield.

241
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,730
AlonE.

242
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,300
madam president.

243
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:09,590
could I.

244
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,780
have a word?

245
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:17,630
It wouldn't be prudent for me to leave you alone with mr.Scofield.

246
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,890
My men are right outside this door.

247
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:21,260
I have a right to privacy.

248
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:25,110
Your rights aren't my first concern.

249
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,120
Do I need to remind you who you are talking to?

250
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:32,740
Step outside,and close the door behind you.

251
00:21:57,230 --> 00:22:00,030
the things you do for your brother.

252
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,890
It's impressive.

253
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:05,330
I could say the same for you.

254
00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:08,880
but I won'T.

255
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:12,070
Bear in mind,your opinion means little to me.

256
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:14,690
This tape.

257
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,350
You have it with you?

258
00:22:18,290 --> 00:22:20,000
No.

259
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,460
But I can arrange for you to hear it.

260
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:29,830
you don't make arrangements for me,mr.Scofield.

261
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,180
I have people for that.

262
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:36,440
I'm not exactly sure what is on this tape,

263
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:40,190
but I doubt it's of any interest to me.

264
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:43,470
It's a recorded conversation between you and your brother.

265
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:47,830
Well,out of millions of conversations that I had with my brother during his lifetime.

266
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,830
I'll narrow it down for you.

267
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:55,290
It was recorded sometime after his death.

268
00:22:56,660 --> 00:23:00,850
And this particular conversation.

269
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:06,170
you might want to keep in the family.

270
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:11,040
And where is it?

271
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:14,520
20 different copies in 20 different locations.

272
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:17,370
I can call my brother right now.

273
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,630
He can play it for you.

274
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,160
Not on the phone.

275
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:23,240
Have him bring it here.

276
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:26,030
These are the terms.

277
00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:29,140
You can hear it over the phone,

278
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:32,610
or you can hear it on the news.

279
00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:36,160
It's up to you.

280
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,320
I know it's why I started.

281
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:44,530
Started what?

282
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:47,230
Using.Same reason as you.

283
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:50,180
Why,because you had to stay up all night during residency?

284
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:55,380
because the bass player dumped you in front of the whole sorority?

285
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:57,830
Yeah,you and I got a lot in common.

286
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,620
I've seen people die,too.

287
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:03,750
I'm assuming you didn't make them die.

288
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:06,590
You need help.

289
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:09,100
Not what I'm looking for.

290
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:18,090
For your sake,I hope your boyfriend calls back real soon.

291
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:43,180
ia?

292
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:48,700
Maricruz?

293
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:55,180
Where the hell is everybody?

294
00:24:58,650 --> 00:25:00,070
mami.

295
00:25:04,930 --> 00:25:06,720
lookie here,good ol' sucre.

296
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:07,860
What did you do to them?

297
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:08,730
Where are they? Maricruz!

298
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:11,640
Hey,hey,hey,hey,keep your cap on.

299
00:25:11,770 --> 00:25:14,010
They're out picking apples for the snuffleupagus.

300
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:15,720
- If you ever.
- calm down!

301
00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:17,570
They're going to walk back in here any minute.

302
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:20,220
which means trouble.

303
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:26,390
Now,unless you want to see me try out the new t-20z on your  bella muchacha,mari-poon.

304
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:29,760
I think you'd better come with me.

305
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:40,260
Lincoln burrows?

306
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,710
Caroline reynolds.

307
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:46,810
I understand you have something for me.

308
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:52,930
You still there?

309
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:54,130
Oh,I'm here.

310
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:56,310
It's good to finally talk to you.

311
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:01,760
Wish I had the chance one of those 242 nights I spent on death row.

312
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:05,000
Please just play the tape.

313
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:15,890
It's awful,I know.

314
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:18,300
But the choice was clear.

315
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:21,260
You needed to be far away from all of this.

316
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:22,410
I am.

317
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:24,980
I'm the isle of terrence,far off to sea.

318
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:26,930
Look,I'm still here for you.

319
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:30,970
Now,listen to me,don't dwell on the negative.

320
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:33,280
Some people deserve to dwell,caroline.

321
00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:36,360
You know I'm only a phone call away.

322
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:39,290
And 3,000 miles.

323
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,240
Do you.

324
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:46,230
do you know how cold it is here?

325
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,500
We talked about this,terrence.

326
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:52,020
You knew that you would be lonely,but it's only temporary.

327
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:54,290
His appeals process has started already.

328
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:57,140
This is gonna fly by quicker than your 20s.

329
00:26:57,730 --> 00:27:01,120
And soon the world will forget all about him

330
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:03,260
and they'll forget about you,too.

331
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:04,500
I promise.

332
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:05,930
But.

333
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:12,440
it's killing me not being able to see you,sweet caroline.

334
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:14,150
I want to see you,too.

335
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,650
But that can't happen right now.

336
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:18,000
This house is so big.

337
00:27:18,010 --> 00:27:19,800
I just think of you.

338
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,360
lying in bed.

339
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:25,540
I know.Me,too.

340
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:27,720
Your warmth.your touch.

341
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:41,900
Was it quick when he killed himself?

342
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:45,430
It was a lot quicker than how my father died.

343
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,750
They shot him in the back.

344
00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:50,720
He died in my arms.

345
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:54,050
I just want to know what happened.

346
00:27:55,730 --> 00:27:57,770
Your brother apologized.

347
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,590
He said he was sorry,

348
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,390
and then he blew his brains out all over the wall.

349
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:08,060
It was quick.

350
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:10,610
And it was his decision.

351
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:13,680
And now it's time for you to make yours.

352
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:22,120
nah,nah,nah,man.

353
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:23,800
I can't do it.

354
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:25,330
I can't do that.

355
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:27,230
Yes,you can.

356
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:29,930
There's nothing to be afraid of.

357
00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:32,580
You don't get it,do you?

358
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,980
You can't stop this guy.

359
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:37,210
Not without your cooperation,I can't,

360
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:38,880
but if you talk to me,

361
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:43,180
if you tell me what's going on,I can take care of you,okay?

362
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:45,650
You've got to trust me,mr.Franklin.

363
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:47,860
I can help you.

364
00:28:50,810 --> 00:28:52,090
C-note,right?

365
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:54,950
yeah Whatever,man.

366
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:05,170
All I need you to do is tell me exactly what agent mahone told you.

367
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:10,080
If you give me mahone,I'll give you your life back.

368
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:13,610
God's been smiling down on me,I can tell you that.

369
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:15,880
First,I caught up to haywire up in algoma.

370
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:18,430
He did a swan dive off a grain elevator before they could put him away,

371
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,980
but I still get the reward.

372
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:21,540
Wait,wait,wait.He's dead?

373
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:23,260
Yep,like a gnat on a peterbilt.

374
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:24,710
Hope you don't take the same route,sucre.

375
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,550
Oh,hell no,I got plenty reasons to live.

376
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:28,670
I hope a few of them are in fox river.

377
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:33,190
Or maybe,if you play nice,I'll throw your maricruz a couple bills after I turn you in.

378
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:34,920
How much are you getting for this?

379
00:29:34,930 --> 00:29:36,090
A hundred grand.

380
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:38,780
I bet you never thought your ass'd be worth all that.

381
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:39,850
Wait,wait,wait.

382
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:45,320
What if I know where you can get five million dollars?

383
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,850
You heard me.

384
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:51,940
Where is it?

385
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:53,380
I could take you there,

386
00:29:54,170 --> 00:29:57,320
if you didn't have to take me back to the states and turn me back in.

387
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,570
Where is it?

388
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,970
T-bag's in town.

389
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:08,660
I made my commitment a long time ago.

390
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:13,730
I agreed to put my country ahead of myself,

391
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:16,070
like a mother does for a child.

392
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:24,870
And I thought that what I was doing was noble and that I would be rewarded.

393
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,340
You were wrong.

394
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:29,920
Don't you see that I'm a pawn in this,too?

395
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:37,300
The power that has taken over this country is like a cancer,d it will stop at nothing.

396
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:40,380
It is out of my control.

397
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:42,110
So is this.

398
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:45,570
Tell me what you want from me.

399
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,330
Uncuff me.

400
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:50,690
- I don't have the keys.
- You'll get them.

401
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:53,850
Second,I want you to arrange for me to walk away,alone.

402
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,900
No surveillance.

403
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,530
Okay.

404
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,840
And finally,

405
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:06,430
want a presidential pardon for me and my brother,

406
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:09,630
fully exonerating us of all our crimes.

407
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:12,810
And I want it today.

408
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:23,410
I can't just hand out pardons to anyone I choose.

409
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:25,380
There is a process,rules.

410
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:26,830
This is no exception.

411
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:30,880
A document will be delivered for your approval just like any pardon.

412
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:34,160
You'll sign it and then file it with the attorney general

413
00:31:34,170 --> 00:31:36,110
who'll submit to the presidential record.

414
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:39,590
Fine.I will sign whatever you need me to sign.

415
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,910
That's very kind,but we both know that's not enough.

416
00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:44,710
What do you want from me?

417
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:47,960
I will unlock you myself,walk you out of here.

418
00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:50,580
What,you want me to drive you to the airport?

419
00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:53,930
I guess I'm not as trusting as I used to be,especially with paperwork.

420
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:55,710
It's so easy to lose.

421
00:31:56,130 --> 00:31:58,910
No,I want you to go out there in front of everyone

422
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:02,670
and announce our full pardon on live tv.

423
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:05,370
you're insane.

424
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:08,250
That is not the way things are done.

425
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:11,060
This is not a vacuum--
people will ask questions.

426
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:12,030
Pardon! On stage.Now.

427
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:23,970
And-and how do I know that you won't release the tape an hour later?

428
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,950
You don'T.

429
00:32:27,370 --> 00:32:29,720
You'll just have to take my word for it.

430
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,710
Well,I need more than that.

431
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,750
Well,you're not going to get it.

432
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,820
Caroline.

433
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,400
it's time.

434
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:46,290
Make your choice.

435
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:57,550
Adams,I need you to uncuff the detainee and bring him here to be released.

436
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:01,240
What are you doing?

437
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:05,690
I am going to make an announcement pardoning mr.Scofield and his brother,

438
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:08,140
and he will walk away unharmed.

439
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:10,180
are you out of your mind?

440
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:14,420
He has brought some indisputable evidence to light.

441
00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:17,660
We could end this all right now.

442
00:33:18,090 --> 00:33:19,470
And you're gonna let them walk?

443
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:24,100
Am the commander in chief,and you are a corporate lackey.

444
00:33:24,290 --> 00:33:28,030
I am making the calls now; you have no authority.

445
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:33,020
My men will see to it that mr.Scofield

446
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:37,890
walks away without the interference of you and your pit bulls.

447
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:13,570
- you alone?
- Yeah.

448
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:17,080
How'd you do?

449
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:19,750
Three tickets,one cabin,one way.

450
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:20,630
Nice.

451
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:22,430
I owe you.

452
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:24,120
No,we're even.

453
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:25,850
- These are few you.
- Nice.

454
00:34:26,490 --> 00:34:27,830
And this.

455
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:31,220
What's this?

456
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:33,380
Eddie,when he broke out,

457
00:34:33,390 --> 00:34:35,620
bet me a hundred bucks you'd be caught in a week.

458
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,950
I said,"no way.Not the linc I know."

459
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,840
Figured I'd split it with you.

460
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:44,040
So this is it,huh?

461
00:34:47,350 --> 00:34:48,810
Good luck.

462
00:34:50,910 --> 00:34:52,320
- You take care.
- You,too.

463
00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:53,630
All right.

464
00:34:54,010 --> 00:34:55,500
You be safe.

465
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:20,940
Your neck of the woods.

466
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:22,360
Yeah,how's third and racine?

467
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:23,640
I'll be there.

468
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:33,890
I don't want to do this,I really don'T.

469
00:35:35,410 --> 00:35:36,880
What are you,what are you talking about?

470
00:35:36,890 --> 00:35:38,740
But you can't say that I didn't give you a choice,but you,

471
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:41,160
you know,you never take the easy way,you.

472
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,630
and I noticed that about you,you.

473
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,750
I didn't expect it to be any different,

474
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:48,620
but I have a job to do,

475
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:51,020
a job that I'm being made to do.

476
00:35:54,370 --> 00:35:55,810
pick it up,sara.

477
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:58,510
Sara,pick it up.

478
00:35:59,010 --> 00:36:00,970
- Pick up the phone!
- Wait,wait!

479
00:36:03,770 --> 00:36:05,110
Don't move.

480
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,770
Just,uh.

481
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,410
don't,don't move.

482
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:11,600
Okay,I need the phone.Give me the phone.

483
00:36:13,390 --> 00:36:15,610
Stay right where you are,please.

484
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:18,880
You don't really want to do this.

485
00:36:18,890 --> 00:36:21,130
You don't know the first thing about what I want.

486
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:41,100
get my message?

487
00:36:45,310 --> 00:36:45,840
I got her.

488
00:36:45,850 --> 00:36:47,030
She's on her way out.

489
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:50,680
Follow her; she'll take you right to scofield.

490
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:12,850
SiR.

491
00:37:13,770 --> 00:37:15,470
we need to talk.

492
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:23,950
In just a few minutes,the president is going to announce a pardon for burrows and scofield.

493
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:26,970
As you're well aware,this is quite a departure.

494
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:32,140
She's always been willing to play ball,but I think we need to take some sort of action.

495
00:37:33,410 --> 00:37:35,040
Sir.

496
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:39,000
I hate to disturb you,

497
00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:44,580
but I'm not sure you realize the gravity of what she's about to do.

498
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:04,700
michael.

499
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:07,860
Sara,it worked.

500
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:09,480
The pardon?

501
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:12,430
She's announcing it any minute.

502
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:15,310
Oh,my god.

503
00:38:15,850 --> 00:38:17,570
oh,my god.

504
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:19,110
Michael,that's amazing.

505
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:21,060
Just get here,okay?

506
00:38:22,490 --> 00:38:24,000
I'm on,uh.

507
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,360
highland.It's a warehouse.

508
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:28,280
It runs right down to the water.

509
00:38:28,410 --> 00:38:30,320
Uh,yeah,yeah,I'm on my way.

510
00:39:09,490 --> 00:39:11,040
we did it.

511
00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:17,430
what happened to your face,man?

512
00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:19,480
If you want to take the ride.

513
00:39:20,990 --> 00:39:22,780
you got to buy the ticket.

514
00:39:23,410 --> 00:39:24,500
Yeah,right.Well,uh,

515
00:39:24,830 --> 00:39:27,470
derek hooked us up with a cabin on one of those freighters.

516
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:29,620
South america via the great lakeS.

517
00:39:29,790 --> 00:39:31,690
We're not going to need that,but,uh,

518
00:39:32,130 --> 00:39:34,530
this is appreciated.

519
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,320
One more time,bro.

520
00:39:37,130 --> 00:39:38,410
We did it?

521
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:39,630
It's done.

522
00:39:40,530 --> 00:39:41,930
We're done.

523
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:47,620
I wish I could have seen the look on her face.

524
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:50,750
No,you don'T.

525
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:52,950
Oh,ye,I do.

526
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,300
Unbelievable.

527
00:39:59,310 --> 00:40:00,680
She's going to do it.

528
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,540
Unbelievable.

529
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:09,330
The president is now taking the stage here at the grand carlisle hotel.

530
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:13,720
The two-hour delay in her appearance  due to an investigation  characterized

531
00:40:13,730 --> 00:40:17,640
by press secretary ryan berg as "an overzealous fan."

532
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,400
You are not going to do this.

533
00:40:26,410 --> 00:40:27,510
I'm afraid I am.

534
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,530
There are some developments you need to be aware of.

535
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:31,010
I have made my decision.

536
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:33,980
And I would appreciate you not second-guessing me.

537
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:36,180
I don't think you understand.

538
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:37,860
We know your secrets,too.

539
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:42,030
And we can reveal them just as easily.

540
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:45,480
You need to ask yourself who you fear more,michael scofield

541
00:40:46,290 --> 00:40:47,760
or us?

542
00:40:47,770 --> 00:40:49,120
You got 30 seconds.

543
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,120
I won't keep you.

544
00:40:52,210 --> 00:40:53,580
The world is waiting.

545
00:40:53,590 --> 00:40:54,820
Ten seconds.

546
00:40:54,830 --> 00:40:57,570
Ladies and gentlemen,the president of the united states.

547
00:40:57,580 --> 00:41:00,750
Nine,eight,seven.

548
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:04,560
Six,five,four,

549
00:41:04,570 --> 00:41:08,070
three,two,one.

550
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:12,900
Thank you for waiting so patiently all afternoon.

551
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:17,740
If it were not for the support of this great state,

552
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:20,630
my home state of illinois.

553
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:26,890
I would not be here today.

554
00:41:27,390 --> 00:41:33,660
Which is why I have chosen today to make this very important announcement.

555
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:38,370
A situation has recently come to light,

556
00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:41,780
and I feel that I must take action.

557
00:41:42,210 --> 00:41:45,940
It is my job as president of this great country

558
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:51,450
to make rational decisions when I am given facts.

559
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:56,900
Decisions that are best not for me,but for the people.

560
00:41:59,370 --> 00:42:03,680
And so,after much consideration,

561
00:42:04,370 --> 00:42:06,900
I regret to inform you

562
00:42:07,890 --> 00:42:13,310
that I have been diagnosed with a highly malignant form of cancer.

563
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:19,710
and because of that reason,

564
00:42:20,110 --> 00:42:25,230
I am no longer fit to serve as your commander in chief.

565
00:42:26,830 --> 00:42:30,630
In the best interest of this country,effective immediately,

566
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:37,220
I am stepping down as president of the united states.

567
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:46,820
If she ain't the president,the tape's useless.

568
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:49,450
She can't pardon anyone.

569
00:42:50,990 --> 00:42:52,740
We got nothing.

570
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:59,790
There's only one thing we can do.

571
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:03,510
We got to disappear.

572
00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:06,420
forever.

573
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:09,400
