1
00:00:01,102 --> 00:00:02,933
Previously on Prison Break:

2
00:00:03,022 --> 00:00:04,819
-What are the charges?
-Attempted murder.

3
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:08,038
He's also arraigned for the murder
of his mother and his stepfather.

4
00:00:08,079 --> 00:00:11,207
Don't look at me like I'm some con.
You're as crooked as scoliosis.

5
00:00:11,246 --> 00:00:12,804
I don't get caught.

6
00:00:13,198 --> 00:00:14,665
This is as far as you go.

7
00:00:14,766 --> 00:00:17,633
-come on, bro.
-You and l, we're not bros.

8
00:00:21,998 --> 00:00:24,398
When were you planning on
telling us about the money?

9
00:00:24,462 --> 00:00:26,157
-What money?
-Five million dollars...

10
00:00:26,254 --> 00:00:28,814
...that Westmoreland
planted in the desert in Utah.

11
00:00:29,134 --> 00:00:32,103
I found Steadman.
I'm with him now, Linc. He's alive.

12
00:00:32,142 --> 00:00:33,734
What? You found Steadman?

13
00:00:33,838 --> 00:00:35,465
Oh, my God.

14
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:43,435
My hand has been in that box
for hours now. It is dying.

15
00:00:43,503 --> 00:00:45,801
-I can promise you nothing.
-Story of my life.

16
00:00:46,094 --> 00:00:49,291
-And these?
-The keys to a car that's waiting for us.

17
00:00:49,326 --> 00:00:52,090
-A couple hundred yards.
-That a two-of-us or a five-of-us?

18
00:00:52,143 --> 00:00:54,304
-That's a two-of-us.
-We got company.

19
00:00:55,534 --> 00:00:56,762
How did he know?

20
00:00:56,878 --> 00:01:01,487
It's only a matter of time before we know
everything that is in Scofield's head.

21
00:01:01,487 --> 00:01:03,819
Where he plans to run to,
how he plans to get there.

22
00:01:03,886 --> 00:01:06,116
So when the time comes
that he does get there...

23
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:07,624
...we' ll be waiting for him.

24
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:12,144
Canadian and Mexican border patrols
have all the mug shots.

25
00:01:12,207 --> 00:01:13,401
BORTA C's on high alert.

26
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:17,774
See if we can get the Mexican border patrol
to set up checkpoints 50 miles in.

27
00:01:17,774 --> 00:01:20,709
The warden over at Fox River called,
asked to be kept in the loop.

28
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:23,412
-What should I tell him?
-That he's no longer in it.

29
00:01:23,471 --> 00:01:26,167
That info that you asked for
is on your desk when you get in.

30
00:01:26,222 --> 00:01:27,712
Thank you.

31
00:02:38,094 --> 00:02:39,356
What's the plan, man>

32
00:02:40,238 --> 00:02:42,069
No bars on these doors.
Do what you like.

33
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:44,195
With what?

34
00:02:44,302 --> 00:02:46,862
We're supposed to be in Mexico,
sipping on margaritas...

35
00:02:46,926 --> 00:02:50,259
...waiting for the heat to dip.
That was the plan.

36
00:02:50,446 --> 00:02:53,938
See? They just used us to dig, right?
We're gophers.

37
00:02:53,967 --> 00:02:55,730
-Where's Michael?
-He'll be here.

38
00:02:55,822 --> 00:02:57,619
Okay. You know what, Sucre?

39
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:01,077
Maybe you and I should go and get that
$5 million, you know what l'm saying?

40
00:03:01,102 --> 00:03:05,038
-lt's sitting there in Tooele, ready to get.
-You wanna stay, shut your mouth.

41
00:03:05,038 --> 00:03:07,370
-You've got one more time to touch me.
-Guys, chill.

42
00:03:07,438 --> 00:03:08,905
-What?
-Hey!

43
00:03:12,622 --> 00:03:14,681
Relax.

44
00:03:25,486 --> 00:03:27,977
Honey, are you sure
you packed everything?

45
00:03:33,902 --> 00:03:36,029
Yummy.

46
00:03:43,118 --> 00:03:45,552
Our photos are in the paper.
They're all over the news.

47
00:03:45,614 --> 00:03:47,980
Yeah, and you didn't see that coming?

48
00:03:50,574 --> 00:03:54,271
-What's so funny?
-The two of you. Cracks me up.

49
00:03:54,286 --> 00:03:56,686
Here's to amateur hour.

50
00:03:57,358 --> 00:03:59,588
-What do you say?
-Yeah, yuk it up, funnyman.

51
00:04:05,102 --> 00:04:06,501
Last supper, boys.

52
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:11,103
This is the part where we say goodbye.

53
00:04:12,078 --> 00:04:13,875
It's not much.

54
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:15,851
It's enough to get you started.

55
00:04:18,702 --> 00:04:20,829
-Hey....
-No.

56
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:23,879
-I'm not telling you where Fibonacci is.
-Well, I didn't ask.

57
00:04:25,422 --> 00:04:29,188
I only ask for a quarter for a phone call.

58
00:04:29,198 --> 00:04:31,029
Make four.

59
00:04:31,342 --> 00:04:32,775
Thank you.

60
00:04:34,574 --> 00:04:36,371
I wonder what happened
to the other guys.

61
00:04:37,102 --> 00:04:40,265
They all had a head start.
Except for T-Bag.

62
00:04:40,302 --> 00:04:44,261
Yeah, he was bleeding pretty bad.

63
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:46,833
Think he's dead?

64
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:55,943
Are you done?

65
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:59,948
-No, I still have to clean it.
-But you're done?

66
00:05:01,422 --> 00:05:02,650
Yes.

67
00:05:24,846 --> 00:05:26,108
It's time to move.

68
00:05:26,734 --> 00:05:28,258
We got everything we need.

69
00:05:28,366 --> 00:05:30,926
Just a quick stop in Utah
and then we're off to Mexico.

70
00:05:31,118 --> 00:05:35,214
L.J. has a hearing today
to determine if he gets tried as an adult.

71
00:05:35,438 --> 00:05:37,133
I can get him.

72
00:05:38,062 --> 00:05:40,326
-It's not the right time.
-When will it be?

73
00:05:40,398 --> 00:05:42,889
After we go to Mexico.
After we're off the news.

74
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:44,721
They framed him for a double homicide.

75
00:05:44,814 --> 00:05:47,510
Soon as he loses his hearing,
they're gonna ship him out.

76
00:05:47,566 --> 00:05:50,433
So today in the courthouse
is my only chance to get him.

77
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:53,560
They took Veronica.
They're not gonna take my son.

78
00:05:53,614 --> 00:05:55,104
I know.

79
00:05:55,214 --> 00:05:56,511
I know.

80
00:05:57,486 --> 00:05:59,647
I would never leave L.J. behind.

81
00:06:00,366 --> 00:06:03,767
But we can't do this now.
There's no plan in place.

82
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:05,815
Believe me, I know that courthouse.

83
00:06:05,902 --> 00:06:07,961
I've been there more times
than I can remember.

84
00:06:08,046 --> 00:06:11,072
The person guarding him's the bailiff.
He carries Mace and a stick.

85
00:06:11,118 --> 00:06:14,417
So you're gonna bum-rush the courthouse.
That's your plan.

86
00:06:14,638 --> 00:06:16,970
-Are you serious?
-Yeah.

87
00:06:17,133 --> 00:06:18,725
Hey, y'all, we're headed out, man.

88
00:06:21,518 --> 00:06:23,986
Well, good luck to everyone.

89
00:06:24,046 --> 00:06:26,446
-Stay out of trouble.
-Yeah.

90
00:06:30,478 --> 00:06:32,343
This is it, papi.

91
00:06:33,422 --> 00:06:36,721
-I hope you find the girl, buddy.
-She's all I have.

92
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,274
I'll die trying.

93
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:44,498
-Good luck.
-Yeah, you be easy, man.

94
00:06:52,557 --> 00:06:55,390
Maybe we'll see each other again.

95
00:06:55,854 --> 00:06:57,981
You never know, Michael.

96
00:06:58,286 --> 00:06:59,514
You never know.

97
00:07:17,774 --> 00:07:20,208
Tell me everything you know
about the courthouse.

98
00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:26,958
Season 2
Episode 2
Otis

99
00:08:06,318 --> 00:08:08,752
-You get any sleep?
-couple hours.

100
00:08:08,814 --> 00:08:10,611
Eight of them. I still can't believe it.

101
00:08:10,702 --> 00:08:14,502
This is exhibit A why you don't let women
work in the military or the police force...

102
00:08:14,509 --> 00:08:17,273
...especially inside a male prison.
Because look what you get.

103
00:08:17,326 --> 00:08:19,920
Dr. Sweetcheeks leaves the door open
for Scofield.

104
00:08:19,982 --> 00:08:22,644
-And here we are.
-Sounds like there's more to the escape--

105
00:08:22,701 --> 00:08:25,397
If Tancredi doesn't leave
her office door unlocked...

106
00:08:25,454 --> 00:08:28,287
...those eight dirtbags
would be in the SHU right now, okay?

107
00:08:28,334 --> 00:08:30,700
-Bottom line!
-Brad.

108
00:08:31,918 --> 00:08:33,579
-Any update?
-None.

109
00:08:33,678 --> 00:08:36,078
They were last seen
at that cemetery in Oswego.

110
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:38,006
-We'll get them.
-They'll get them.

111
00:08:38,094 --> 00:08:40,858
-It's been handed to the FBl.
-Doesn't mean we can't work it.

112
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:42,241
It does, actually.

113
00:08:42,349 --> 00:08:45,477
-You and I have been pulled off the pursuit.
-Why?

114
00:08:45,518 --> 00:08:48,783
We're going to find out shortly.
We have to report to DOC headquarters.

115
00:08:48,813 --> 00:08:51,407
-I will meet you there.
-Sir, we can get these guys.

116
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:53,938
-Give me a couple more days and I swear l--
-Brad.

117
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:58,490
We've got to go.

118
00:09:14,766 --> 00:09:16,791
No family with Patoshik? Nothing?

119
00:09:16,878 --> 00:09:21,070
Yeah. Until about four years ago,
when he killed them all.

120
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:25,234
Updated rap sheet on Apolskis.
Take a look when you get a chance.

121
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:43,399
You have to use the key
that we keep in the grill because that's--

122
00:09:45,709 --> 00:09:47,506
Man, I'm so sorry.

123
00:09:47,598 --> 00:09:49,293
It's my bad. My bad, bro.

124
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:50,982
I'm sorry.

125
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:08,440
"Scott Kolbrenner."

126
00:10:19,086 --> 00:10:20,986
It's this one here.

127
00:10:21,902 --> 00:10:23,995
Don't touch the radio.

128
00:10:33,486 --> 00:10:37,047
Yeah, hi. I'm with the Des Moines Herald,
I'm covering the L.J. Burrows hearing.

129
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:39,163
What time's that start today?

130
00:10:55,245 --> 00:10:56,678
come on.

131
00:11:29,006 --> 00:11:31,998
Thank you. Three o'clock.
The hearing lasts a half-hour max.

132
00:11:32,046 --> 00:11:35,277
He'll be taken down to Transport Bay
at 1 0 till to catch the 4:.00 van.

133
00:11:35,309 --> 00:11:36,640
So how do we get close to him?

134
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:40,516
Well, when I was locked up,
I had nothing to do except study the briefs.

135
00:11:40,526 --> 00:11:43,461
Nick Savrinn's bar number
was on the front page of every one.

136
00:11:43,501 --> 00:11:44,763
We wanna talk to L.J., we--

137
00:11:44,878 --> 00:11:47,039
-We pose as one of his attorneys.
-Yeah.

138
00:11:49,005 --> 00:11:51,872
Hogwash. That is absolute hogwash.

139
00:11:51,918 --> 00:11:53,613
Please answer the question.

140
00:11:53,934 --> 00:11:56,835
How was Scofield able
to have exclusive access to you...

141
00:11:56,877 --> 00:11:59,072
...pull a shank on you
and bind you to your chair?

142
00:11:59,149 --> 00:12:01,640
The warden of the penitentiary.

143
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:03,735
I trusted him.

144
00:12:03,822 --> 00:12:06,382
Obviously, he betrayed that trust.

145
00:12:08,045 --> 00:12:09,273
Officer Bellick...

146
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:14,477
...is it true that almost all the inmates
who either escaped or tried to escape...

147
00:12:14,477 --> 00:12:17,275
-...worked in Prison lndustries?
-That's right.

148
00:12:17,326 --> 00:12:19,157
Why did these inmates
have so much time...

149
00:12:19,246 --> 00:12:21,578
...to dig a hole in the floor
of the guards' room...

150
00:12:21,645 --> 00:12:24,239
-...while working Prison lndustries?
-I can answer that.

151
00:12:24,302 --> 00:12:26,896
If any of you
have ever worked a day in a prison...

152
00:12:26,957 --> 00:12:29,619
...you would know
since an inmate gets 1 9 cents an hour...

153
00:12:29,677 --> 00:12:33,010
...some are bound to drag their feet.

154
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:36,021
Officer Bellick...

155
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:40,137
...is it true you sold the right to run
Prison lndustries to the highest bidder?

156
00:12:40,141 --> 00:12:43,474
-No. Who the hell told you that?
-This is unbelievable.

157
00:12:43,502 --> 00:12:48,064
While we're wasting time in here,
there are eight escaped convicts out there--

158
00:13:03,789 --> 00:13:06,815
Were you employed at Fox River
as a correctional officer, Mr. Geary?

159
00:13:06,925 --> 00:13:07,914
-Yep.
-Yeah...

160
00:13:08,046 --> 00:13:10,310
...until he was fired
for shaking down inmates.

161
00:13:10,382 --> 00:13:12,976
That'll be your last outburst, officer.

162
00:13:13,229 --> 00:13:15,697
Were you aware of any arrangement
Officer Bellick had...

163
00:13:15,757 --> 00:13:18,590
...with any inmate
regarding Prison lndustries?

164
00:13:18,637 --> 00:13:20,195
Yeah, he sold it to John Abruzzi.

165
00:13:20,301 --> 00:13:23,737
John Abruzzi,
who is one of the escaped convicts?

166
00:13:23,758 --> 00:13:25,055
Yep.

167
00:13:25,165 --> 00:13:28,100
We'll get other c.O.'s to substantiate this
if we have to...

168
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:30,974
...so l'm giving you one chance
to get in front of it.

169
00:13:31,981 --> 00:13:34,449
Did you sell Prison lndustries
to John Abruzzi?

170
00:13:36,973 --> 00:13:38,736
Yes or no?

171
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:43,270
-Yes. But at no time was I aware of--
-That'll be all, Officer Bellick.

172
00:13:43,278 --> 00:13:45,337
That will be all.

173
00:13:45,677 --> 00:13:48,441
Warden, you and Officer Bellick
can step out into the hallway.

174
00:13:48,493 --> 00:13:51,155
We'll call for you
when we've reached a decision.

175
00:14:15,885 --> 00:14:18,012
I'm gonna get some coffee.

176
00:14:20,877 --> 00:14:22,902
Well, I did my best
under the circumstances.

177
00:14:24,046 --> 00:14:26,105
The good news, sir,
is you had the hand iced...

178
00:14:26,189 --> 00:14:30,057
...so I was able to restore blood flow
and the bones are pinned.

179
00:14:30,062 --> 00:14:33,031
However, I recommend
you get medical attention ASAP.

180
00:14:33,933 --> 00:14:37,061
Meanwhile, some aspirin.
It'll help thin the blood and avoid clotting.

181
00:14:37,677 --> 00:14:39,907
Antibiotics, some painkillers.

182
00:14:41,709 --> 00:14:44,041
I usually tell the owner of the dog,
cat, whatever...

183
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:46,806
...to coat them with peanut butter
so they're easier to chew.

184
00:14:46,861 --> 00:14:49,694
-But obviously, in your case--
-You did one hell of a job, doc.

185
00:14:49,741 --> 00:14:51,368
Well, thank you.

186
00:14:52,205 --> 00:14:54,730
Well, it's okay for you to leave now.

187
00:14:54,797 --> 00:14:56,628
Oh, l'm leaving.

188
00:14:57,486 --> 00:14:59,386
-And you're not.
-What?

189
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:02,132
-You heard me.
-Look, sir, I haven't seen anything...

190
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:04,488
...and I won't tell anyone.

191
00:15:04,557 --> 00:15:09,229
You know,
I fell for that bill of goods once before.

192
00:15:09,229 --> 00:15:10,491
Never again.

193
00:15:11,821 --> 00:15:15,655
-Sir, I swear to God I will tell nobody.
-You would.

194
00:15:15,661 --> 00:15:17,060
And I would die in prison.

195
00:15:22,925 --> 00:15:25,416
Please, please, please.

196
00:15:27,406 --> 00:15:29,966
Now, you did me a solid,
so l'm gonna return the favor.

197
00:15:30,413 --> 00:15:33,439
This can go down humanely
if you don't fight.

198
00:15:33,485 --> 00:15:38,830
But if you pull a stunt like that again,
it's gonna get inhumane right quick.

199
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:40,058
Your call.

200
00:15:40,173 --> 00:15:42,300
But one way or another...

201
00:15:43,789 --> 00:15:46,349
...I am putting you down, doc.

202
00:15:57,933 --> 00:15:59,992
-Lincoln Burrows Jr.?
-Yeah.

203
00:16:00,077 --> 00:16:01,806
In here. You got a visitor.

204
00:16:12,845 --> 00:16:14,244
You must be L.J.

205
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:19,698
Agent Mahone, FBl. Thank you.

206
00:16:21,741 --> 00:16:23,402
Please.

207
00:16:26,574 --> 00:16:28,804
I'm assuming you've heard.

208
00:16:29,741 --> 00:16:31,470
Yeah.

209
00:16:31,789 --> 00:16:35,122
I have to tell you,
what your dad and uncle pulled off....

210
00:16:36,461 --> 00:16:39,897
Very impressive.
I've been doing this 1 4 years...

211
00:16:39,918 --> 00:16:44,446
...and most escapes can be attributed
to dumb luck or brute force.

212
00:16:44,558 --> 00:16:47,721
The level of planning and sophistication
that went into this one...

213
00:16:47,757 --> 00:16:50,055
...and eight guys got out....

214
00:16:50,701 --> 00:16:53,966
I really do, professionally speaking...

215
00:16:53,997 --> 00:16:56,989
...have a lot of admiration
for Lincoln and Michael.

216
00:16:57,325 --> 00:16:59,418
cool. Now we're buddies.

217
00:17:02,606 --> 00:17:04,301
What do you need?

218
00:17:04,718 --> 00:17:07,846
Help me bring them in peacefully.

219
00:17:07,885 --> 00:17:09,648
I don't know where they are.

220
00:17:09,741 --> 00:17:12,904
-I don't know where they're going.
-There's another way you can help.

221
00:17:13,358 --> 00:17:15,155
-How?
-Go on TV.

222
00:17:16,461 --> 00:17:19,692
I can have a camera crew down here
in a half an hour.

223
00:17:25,517 --> 00:17:28,350
You know what, man?
The murder charge they put on my dad...

224
00:17:28,397 --> 00:17:30,558
...the two murder charges they put me...

225
00:17:30,637 --> 00:17:33,037
...everything's been a setup,
coming from way up top.

226
00:17:33,357 --> 00:17:35,825
So the fact that you work
for the government....

227
00:17:36,973 --> 00:17:39,203
I got nothing to say.

228
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:49,800
I'll give you the same advice that you'd get
from the guy working at the deli downstairs.

229
00:17:49,805 --> 00:17:52,103
Start thinking about yourself now.

230
00:17:52,173 --> 00:17:55,142
In fact, the sooner the better,
because no one...

231
00:17:55,181 --> 00:17:57,945
...not your father, L.J., not your uncle...

232
00:17:57,997 --> 00:17:59,965
...is going to do your time.

233
00:18:00,365 --> 00:18:03,698
And at 1 6 years old,
you're looking at a long stretch.

234
00:18:03,725 --> 00:18:07,456
How much time you get,
where you serve it...

235
00:18:07,821 --> 00:18:09,755
...who your cellmate might be.

236
00:18:13,549 --> 00:18:17,041
You need to start thinking
about yourself now.

237
00:18:17,069 --> 00:18:20,664
I want your dad, I want your uncle,
and l'm willing to deal.

238
00:18:23,181 --> 00:18:25,308
Don't wait and let someone else
get the reward.

239
00:18:41,389 --> 00:18:42,879
What's up?

240
00:18:43,533 --> 00:18:45,262
Hey, man, you look familiar.

241
00:18:48,173 --> 00:18:50,869
Did you rush Sig Ep last semester?

242
00:18:50,925 --> 00:18:52,756
-Sig what?
-Sig Ep.

243
00:18:56,173 --> 00:18:58,232
-No.
-Next in line.

244
00:19:00,013 --> 00:19:01,241
Where to?

245
00:19:01,741 --> 00:19:03,299
Utah.

246
00:19:17,006 --> 00:19:18,439
How we doing here?

247
00:19:21,677 --> 00:19:23,042
Nothing until tomorrow.

248
00:19:25,485 --> 00:19:27,715
All right, yo, I got 45 bucks.

249
00:19:27,789 --> 00:19:29,950
How far will that get me?

250
00:19:41,933 --> 00:19:44,993
Nick Savrinn. Bar number is 56437.

251
00:19:45,037 --> 00:19:48,234
I got a call time with my client,
L.J. Burrows.

252
00:19:53,453 --> 00:19:56,081
-Hello.
-Know who this is?

253
00:19:56,429 --> 00:19:57,953
Yeah.

254
00:19:58,061 --> 00:19:59,790
Yeah, Nick Savrinn.

255
00:19:59,885 --> 00:20:01,216
How you holding up?

256
00:20:02,061 --> 00:20:03,289
Doing what I can do.

257
00:20:03,405 --> 00:20:04,963
How about you>

258
00:20:05,997 --> 00:20:07,658
I'm worried about you.

259
00:20:07,757 --> 00:20:10,055
-l'm sorry about what you're going through.
-Thanks.

260
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:15,222
Word is after this hearing,
because of my dad being so high-profile...

261
00:20:17,069 --> 00:20:20,163
...they're shipping me to an adult facility
in Kingman, Arizona.

262
00:20:20,205 --> 00:20:22,935
Yeah, well,
hopefully that ain't gonna happen.

263
00:20:23,149 --> 00:20:24,480
You hear from Veronica today?

264
00:20:25,261 --> 00:20:28,253
She didn't show up.
They gave me some court-appointed clown.

265
00:20:29,581 --> 00:20:32,550
No, I haven't heard from her.

266
00:20:32,589 --> 00:20:35,353
Hey, this fed came by
and talked to me today.

267
00:20:36,365 --> 00:20:37,354
Yeah?

268
00:20:37,485 --> 00:20:40,249
He wanted me to help try
in getting my dad to turn himself in.

269
00:20:40,301 --> 00:20:42,599
Well, knowing your dad,
I doubt that's gonna happen.

270
00:20:42,669 --> 00:20:44,466
Listen up, L.J., this is real important.

271
00:20:44,941 --> 00:20:49,357
-All right.
-On the third, look out for Otis Wright.

272
00:20:49,357 --> 00:20:53,316
You got that>
On the third, look out for Otis Wright.

273
00:20:53,325 --> 00:20:55,088
Until then, keep your head up.

274
00:20:55,181 --> 00:20:57,115
-What?
-Just remember that.

275
00:20:57,197 --> 00:20:59,256
I'm gonna do everything I can
to get you out.

276
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:00,603
Hey, Nick.

277
00:21:01,197 --> 00:21:02,562
If you talk to my dad...

278
00:21:02,669 --> 00:21:05,194
...tell him no matter what, I love him.

279
00:21:11,597 --> 00:21:13,861
-Hey.
-Hey.

280
00:21:13,933 --> 00:21:17,061
-Did you get him?
-Let's do this.

281
00:21:18,317 --> 00:21:20,308
We got one more stop.

282
00:21:30,637 --> 00:21:33,231
There is a belief in my religion
which I know to be true...

283
00:21:33,293 --> 00:21:36,387
...and it applies to everyone,
Hindu or not.

284
00:21:37,069 --> 00:21:41,517
The acts we commit in this life
determine where we go in the next.

285
00:21:41,517 --> 00:21:45,715
And he who commits evil
can never hope for eternal happiness.

286
00:21:47,021 --> 00:21:48,921
Never been a goal of mine, doc.

287
00:21:49,005 --> 00:21:51,405
I'm more a here-and-now type.

288
00:21:53,933 --> 00:21:56,527
I'll tell you something I know is true.

289
00:21:56,589 --> 00:22:00,941
The lndians here, the tomahawk variety...

290
00:22:00,941 --> 00:22:02,169
...some of them believe--

291
00:22:02,285 --> 00:22:05,482
Well, used to believe, before most
of them were slaughtered.

292
00:22:05,517 --> 00:22:11,245
--that when a warrior
kills another in battle...

293
00:22:11,245 --> 00:22:16,581
...he absorbs that fallen warrior's spirit.

294
00:22:17,933 --> 00:22:20,800
So this isn't the end for you, doc.

295
00:22:23,405 --> 00:22:25,839
You're with me now.

296
00:23:33,357 --> 00:23:35,848
And how are you doing this fine day?

297
00:23:37,933 --> 00:23:39,230
I'm great. How are you?

298
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:42,902
couldn't be better.
Anything in particular I can help you find?

299
00:23:42,925 --> 00:23:44,222
Just looking. Thanks.

300
00:23:44,333 --> 00:23:46,893
Well, if you need any assistance,
just give a holler.

301
00:24:13,485 --> 00:24:15,578
-How are we this fine day?
-Great.

302
00:24:15,661 --> 00:24:18,323
-can I help you find anything?
-l'm good, thanks.

303
00:24:23,597 --> 00:24:25,531
Hey, we gotta go.

304
00:24:25,613 --> 00:24:27,080
-I just need to pay up.
-Now.

305
00:24:28,365 --> 00:24:30,731
How are you today, officer?

306
00:24:36,045 --> 00:24:37,808
Yeah, they were right....

307
00:24:39,789 --> 00:24:42,553
Well, they were right back here.

308
00:24:47,052 --> 00:24:48,849
We can make it
to the courthouse on foot.

309
00:24:48,941 --> 00:24:51,569
You don't understand.
Everything is in that car.

310
00:24:51,629 --> 00:24:53,756
Forget the damn car.
We don't have time.

311
00:24:53,837 --> 00:24:55,304
come on, man, let's go.

312
00:25:13,389 --> 00:25:15,687
-Hi.
-Hi.

313
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:54,285
It is the finding of this panel,
Warden Pope...

314
00:25:54,317 --> 00:25:58,048
...you'll be docked two weeks,
placed on three months' probation.

315
00:25:59,117 --> 00:26:01,017
Officer Brad Bellick...

316
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:03,763
...will be terminated,
effective immediately.

317
00:26:04,141 --> 00:26:07,599
Mr. Bellick, you can retrieve whatever
belongings you may have from Fox River.

318
00:26:07,629 --> 00:26:09,119
That'll be all.

319
00:26:10,253 --> 00:26:14,477
I've worked at Fox River
since I was 1 8 years old.

320
00:26:14,477 --> 00:26:16,843
Being a C.O. is my life.

321
00:26:17,101 --> 00:26:18,398
And we appreciate that.

322
00:26:18,508 --> 00:26:21,306
We could've saved a lot of time
if you would've just told us...

323
00:26:21,357 --> 00:26:23,188
...that this was gonna be a railroad.

324
00:26:23,277 --> 00:26:25,802
-That'll be all.
-There is only one person responsible...

325
00:26:25,869 --> 00:26:28,030
...for this escape.
His name is Michael Scofield.

326
00:26:28,108 --> 00:26:31,202
It's not Officer Bellick. It's not me!

327
00:26:31,725 --> 00:26:34,057
But you need a fall guy, fine.

328
00:26:34,124 --> 00:26:36,854
But you're not gonna be
just taking Officer Bellick's job.

329
00:26:36,909 --> 00:26:39,571
Because even though I am not proud
of many of his actions...

330
00:26:39,884 --> 00:26:44,253
...it will be a cold day in hell when
I turn my back on one of my own men.

331
00:26:45,549 --> 00:26:46,811
I quit.

332
00:26:47,213 --> 00:26:48,942
That will be all.

333
00:26:51,725 --> 00:26:55,320
If this thing doesn't work out
and you end up going back to Fox River...

334
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:57,535
...I ain't coming to get you.

335
00:26:57,612 --> 00:27:01,378
I mean, you are the brains
and I am the brute.

336
00:27:07,021 --> 00:27:09,216
Seriously, Michael,
you don't have to do this.

337
00:27:21,964 --> 00:27:23,625
Let's go.

338
00:27:54,092 --> 00:27:55,559
We're good.

339
00:27:56,461 --> 00:28:00,653
You got a call from Nick Savrinn
earlier today. What was that all about?

340
00:28:00,653 --> 00:28:02,985
He's my attorney. That's privileged.

341
00:28:03,052 --> 00:28:06,419
That's odd, because Nick Savrinn
was found dead in his apartment...

342
00:28:06,445 --> 00:28:08,777
...an hour before that call came into you.

343
00:28:09,325 --> 00:28:11,816
-Listen up, L.J., this is real important.
-All right.

344
00:28:11,884 --> 00:28:15,650
On the third, look out for Otis Wright.
You got that>

345
00:28:15,661 --> 00:28:18,221
For someone who's convinced
the government is capable...

346
00:28:18,285 --> 00:28:22,244
...of so many underhanded things,
you sure are playing fast and loose with me.

347
00:28:22,252 --> 00:28:25,016
What are you gonna do,
throw another fake murder charge on me?

348
00:28:25,068 --> 00:28:27,662
-Who's Otis Wright?
-I have no idea.

349
00:28:27,725 --> 00:28:31,183
I think you do. And if you don't tell me,
after you're convicted...

350
00:28:31,213 --> 00:28:35,469
...I will be in that courtroom when you're
sentenced, and I will hang you out to dry.

351
00:28:35,469 --> 00:28:36,868
Take it to the bank.

352
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:26,054
Yeah, put me in touch with the prosecutor
in the L.J. Burrows case.

353
00:29:29,165 --> 00:29:30,393
I want a meeting.

354
00:29:35,981 --> 00:29:38,108
On the third, look out for Otis Wright.

355
00:29:43,532 --> 00:29:45,659
Until then, keep your head up.

356
00:29:51,661 --> 00:29:54,152
Otis Wright.

357
00:29:54,221 --> 00:29:56,553
-Let's go.
-Hold on.

358
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:03,945
-Move it.
-Hold on.

359
00:30:33,612 --> 00:30:35,341
I'll escort the boy.

360
00:30:47,277 --> 00:30:50,769
Otis Wright. Otis elevator on the right.

361
00:30:51,085 --> 00:30:52,575
What is he planning?

362
00:30:54,317 --> 00:30:56,979
Keep it in the holster
and no one gets hurt.

363
00:30:57,997 --> 00:31:00,022
Keep it in the holster.

364
00:31:01,037 --> 00:31:03,437
All right. L.J., hit stop.

365
00:31:06,029 --> 00:31:11,160
He's coming with us, so just stay cool.
Stay cool.

366
00:31:12,268 --> 00:31:14,634
Hey, buddy, give me his gun.

367
00:31:18,861 --> 00:31:20,761
Hey, hey.

368
00:31:27,628 --> 00:31:28,959
L.J., give me your hand.

369
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:32,334
Thattaboy. Come on.

370
00:31:39,181 --> 00:31:41,979
Hey, back off. Back off. Back off.

371
00:31:42,028 --> 00:31:44,019
You're not shooting anybody.
Neither are you.

372
00:31:44,108 --> 00:31:46,008
Give yourself up and your kid can walk.

373
00:31:46,093 --> 00:31:49,551
That's the only way he's getting out
of this place. It's the only way.

374
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:51,891
Dad.

375
00:31:53,036 --> 00:31:55,027
Dad!

376
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:58,863
-Dad, you gotta let me go.
-No.

377
00:31:58,956 --> 00:32:00,719
Dad.

378
00:32:03,948 --> 00:32:05,142
You gotta let me go.

379
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:17,444
Up there. Scofield is in the building.
Take him.

380
00:32:17,612 --> 00:32:23,020
You guys, go. cover that way.
Scofield and Burrows are in the building.

381
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:24,715
come on.

382
00:32:28,716 --> 00:32:30,411
-Freeze!
-Don't move!

383
00:32:30,509 --> 00:32:32,477
-Truck.
-Stop or we will shoot.

384
00:32:32,941 --> 00:32:34,238
Stop!

385
00:32:45,804 --> 00:32:47,795
Two suspects heading south on Liberty.

386
00:33:29,229 --> 00:33:30,958
Bradley?

387
00:33:31,052 --> 00:33:32,781
Yeah, Ma?

388
00:33:34,381 --> 00:33:35,848
What are you doing home so early?

389
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:38,233
Well, I had to take...

390
00:33:39,437 --> 00:33:43,134
...my personal days, you know,
before they went away.

391
00:33:43,148 --> 00:33:45,912
Shouldn't you be looking
for the convicts?

392
00:33:45,964 --> 00:33:48,728
Well, they got somebody else
doing that, Ma.

393
00:33:49,133 --> 00:33:50,498
You okay?

394
00:34:00,909 --> 00:34:02,467
I'm good.

395
00:34:03,085 --> 00:34:04,575
Okay.

396
00:35:11,245 --> 00:35:12,769
All right.

397
00:35:12,876 --> 00:35:15,367
We should break
a bottle of champagne across its bow.

398
00:35:15,437 --> 00:35:18,463
If you're intending to get this home
for your anniversary tonight...

399
00:35:18,508 --> 00:35:20,840
-...I wouldn't recommend it.
-No.

400
00:35:21,164 --> 00:35:24,224
Listen, I want you to know, l....

401
00:35:24,268 --> 00:35:27,294
Well, I feel very fortunate
to have met you.

402
00:35:31,788 --> 00:35:33,619
I'm breaking out.

403
00:35:34,285 --> 00:35:36,617
And you're gonna make sure
my brother goes with me.

404
00:36:53,196 --> 00:36:58,862
Thank you for calling AutoStar, Dr. Gudat.
Am I pronouncing that correctly>

405
00:36:59,116 --> 00:37:02,415
-Dead on.
-How can I help you today>

406
00:37:02,444 --> 00:37:06,039
I need directions.

407
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:09,188
-Where to, sir>
-Utah.

408
00:37:21,388 --> 00:37:22,912
Excuse me.

409
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:24,248
I ' m sorry.

410
00:37:24,364 --> 00:37:25,592
Are you Scott Kolbrenner?

411
00:37:28,108 --> 00:37:30,269
I am, yeah.

412
00:37:30,572 --> 00:37:31,834
You must be Debra Jean.

413
00:37:32,172 --> 00:37:34,072
-It's nice to meet you.
-Yeah, same here.

414
00:37:34,156 --> 00:37:36,454
I was almost ready to leave
when you called.

415
00:37:36,524 --> 00:37:37,752
No one else responded.

416
00:37:37,868 --> 00:37:41,031
I guess there's not a lot of Utah people
out here. Are you from there?

417
00:37:41,868 --> 00:37:43,631
No, I just, you know....

418
00:37:43,724 --> 00:37:47,558
I'm headed out there
to collect an inheritance.

419
00:37:47,564 --> 00:37:49,794
-My grandpa died.
-Oh, l'm sorry to hear that.

420
00:37:49,868 --> 00:37:52,837
It's all right.
He went out with his boots on.

421
00:37:53,132 --> 00:37:54,497
So where's your stuff?

422
00:37:55,532 --> 00:37:57,659
I mailed it yesterday.

423
00:37:57,740 --> 00:38:00,368
Mailed it? I've never heard of that.

424
00:38:00,588 --> 00:38:03,751
You don't wanna lug it around.
Plus, I got a boy who works for UPS.

425
00:38:03,788 --> 00:38:05,949
So he hooked it up.

426
00:38:09,036 --> 00:38:11,129
So you wanna bounce?

427
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:16,953
Okay. I'm parked out front.

428
00:38:27,084 --> 00:38:29,075
Bradley?

429
00:38:29,164 --> 00:38:30,392
Yeah, Ma?

430
00:38:30,508 --> 00:38:34,069
They just announced the rewards
on the TV.

431
00:38:34,092 --> 00:38:36,686
-What reward?
-The convicts.

432
00:38:36,748 --> 00:38:39,410
For the convicts. The ones who escaped.

433
00:38:39,468 --> 00:38:43,302
-How much?
-A hundred thousand dollars apiece.

434
00:38:43,308 --> 00:38:47,468
Three hundred thousand for the animal
who killed President Reynolds' brother.

435
00:38:47,468 --> 00:38:50,232
Every whacko in the country's
gonna be after those bums now...

436
00:38:50,284 --> 00:38:52,184
...wouldn't you say?

437
00:38:58,796 --> 00:39:00,423
Police!

438
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:04,320
Step out of the vehicle
with your hands up.

439
00:39:18,508 --> 00:39:21,272
-We gotta move.
-I can't.

440
00:39:24,428 --> 00:39:26,259
Oh, my God.

441
00:39:34,092 --> 00:39:35,855
I failed him.

442
00:39:44,364 --> 00:39:46,093
I failed him.

443
00:39:50,892 --> 00:39:55,829
I sure hope you packed a lunch.
It's gonna be a long ride to Arizona.

444
00:39:56,267 --> 00:39:58,098
Move your ass.

445
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:27,711
Get men in all the area hospitals. Wherever
they are, one of them's bleeding good.

446
00:40:27,724 --> 00:40:32,718
Which means they either come to us
or they die.

9999
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,000
