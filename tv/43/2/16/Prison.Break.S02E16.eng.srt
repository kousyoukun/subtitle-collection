1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:02,060
Where is it?

2
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:02,970
Go to hell.

3
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:04,240
You did this to yourself.

4
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:09,210
Sara,if you're listening, I only hope,by now,you've found your safe haven.

5
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:13,040
I took advantage of you, put you in a place that's every doctor's nightmare.

6
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,100
Sara tancredi. You know her well?

7
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:17,450
I'd know her a lot better if you can get my ass moved.

8
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:18,490
I'll talk to the warden.

9
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:23,640
"Another chance" and "safe haven." Those are the names of some of the chapters in the book they use an aa.

10
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:26,370
Make no mistake about it.

11
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:29,280
We will be a family if it kills us.

12
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:31,120
That's your map?

13
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:33,320
What happened to your arm?

14
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:35,010
My dad drinks,too.

15
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,950
My tummy hurts.

16
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:42,210
She needs that medicine. She can't go two days without it.

17
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:44,890
Kacee's going into the system now. Aiding an escaped con.

18
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:46,450
Tell her lawyer I'll turn myself in.

19
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:47,750
Kacee said you need to run.

20
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:50,680
If you get busted or turn yourself in, dede won't have either of you.

21
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,790
Michael,I want for this to be over.

22
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:56,340
That makes two of us.It's just a question of looking at whatever it is your father gave you.

23
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:57,780
It's just a key.

24
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:59,460
If I may,sir,the president...

25
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,010
she could be useful.

26
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:02,200
Madam president?

27
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,490
I want you to come home,paul.

28
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,830
We can fix this,but not with those brothers running around the country.

29
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:08,750
Caroline...

30
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:13,130
bring them in,paul,and everything can go back to the way it was.

31
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:18,710
Evansville,Indiana

32
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:39,690
agent kellerman.

33
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:41,290
Paul,where are you?

34
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:43,360
Out in the cold. Remember?

35
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,680
I'm speaking in chicago tonight.

36
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:01,860
lincolN.

37
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:03,130
Sara.

38
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:06,770
It's funny how you only call me when you need me.

39
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:10,240
- Maybe "funny" is not the right word. - All of this can go away,paul.

40
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:13,210
- Can it? - Yes.

41
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:15,790
I'm the president of the united states.

42
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:19,880
Please just come back to chicago and turn burrows and scofield in.

43
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:24,280
I promise you that I will make everything go back to the way it was.

44
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,190
I have to go.

45
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:28,110
Just come back,paul.

46
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:30,230
I need you.

47
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:34,130
You actually think we have a shot?

48
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:37,480
It depends on what your father gave you.

49
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:42,320
This fell out of his pocket when I found him. I don't recognize the insignia,do you?

50
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:46,030
No.

51
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:48,270
But,uh...

52
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:52,820
sara,we've got someone working with us now.

53
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:06,830
good morning,sunshine.

54
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:13,390
How did you sleep?

55
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:20,090
I'll tell you what.

56
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:23,460
I'll go unlock the kids and make us all breakfast.

57
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:24,810
No. I'll get the kids.

58
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:26,570
- No... - tu-tut-tut. I insist.

59
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,000
No.

60
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:48,620
I'll get the kids.

61
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:55,210
Some hand cream will make them rope burns feel better.

62
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:57,140
It won't work.

63
00:03:57,140 --> 00:04:01,450
'Course it will. Says right here on the bottle: "Soothes skin irritations and..."

64
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:03,270
no. This.

65
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:06,400
It won't work.I've got a job. The kids have school.

66
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:12,270
We're all going to get back to our normal routines once this little adjustment period is over.

67
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:14,250
- There's someone coming over today. - Who?

68
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:16,730
This woman,patty,from the welcome wagon committee.

69
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:18,990
- Call her and canceL. - I don't have her number.

70
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:22,440
And,if she shows up,and I don't answer the door,

71
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,740
she's going to know something's wrong.

72
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,660
Teddy...

73
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:36,710
teddy bear...

74
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:39,940
you need to go.

75
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,480
If she recognizes you...

76
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:48,540
I don't want you to get in trouble.

77
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,950
That's nonsense.

78
00:04:58,010 --> 00:04:59,820
It's no trouble.

79
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,870
No trouble at all.

80
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,710
XXXXXXXXXXXX

81
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:15,990
Hi,sara.

82
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:19,120
What's done is done. We all want the same thing.

83
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,540
You didn't tell us you left her to die.

84
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:29,400
I was scaring her.XXXXXX

85
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,960
No. No,you left me in there to drown.

86
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:35,480
I wonder how long you can hold your breath. Maybe we should find out.

87
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,530
You need me,and you know it.

88
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:40,130
You need me. You need me,and you know it.

89
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:46,240
Why?Why do we need him?We have the key. We'll find out what it's for.

90
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:49,660
I can tell you what that key's for right now.

91
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,770
It's to a private cigar club.

92
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,350
Where?

93
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:59,390
Chicago.

97
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:34,820
We have to hurry.

98
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:38,430
We have to hurry,larry. I did a bad thing.

99
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:43,180
God! I did a very bad thing.

100
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,030
All gas stations: On 80,30,77.

101
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:55,670
I want scofield's and burrows' pictures on each and every gas pump.

102
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:58,060
If they have no fuel,they can't get anywhere.

103
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:59,360
- Sir? - What?

104
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,840
We might need to divert our attention away from scofield and burrows for a while.

105
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,010
Why would I do that?

106
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:08,340
Because one of the other escapees just killed a civilian.

107
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:13,040
A man fitting his description was spotted running from the scene of a brutal homicide.

108
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:17,770
Happened in algoma,wisconsin, less than four hours from the prison.

109
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:21,370
Call the field office in madison, and have them get some agents out there right away.

110
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:23,690
- Okay.I'll notify headquarters. - I didn't say headquarters.

111
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:26,310
I said,are you not following direct orders?

112
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:29,200
Oh,I am following direct orders,sir.

113
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:32,560
Just not from you anymore.

114
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:36,160
Everything goes through headquarters from now on.

115
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:38,970
may I?

116
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:49,870
yeah.

117
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,690
You heard about patoshik.

118
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,410
Just now.

119
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,390
Good.

120
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:56,810
He goes.

121
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:59,490
Come on,the man is mentally ill. He doesn't know anything,he's not a threat...

122
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:02,250
patoshik was one of scofield's cellmates for awhile.

123
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:05,150
Scofield included him in the escape. Who knows what he knows?

124
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:08,320
- Scofield and burrows are still out there. - Don't worry about scofield and burrows right now.

125
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:12,410
So,again...

126
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:15,380
patoshik goes.

127
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:17,660
Take care of it.

128
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:24,180
- Hi,are you in charge of seating? - Yeah,can I help you?

129
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:26,480
Agent paul kellerman,secret service.

130
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:29,840
I'm transporting a fugitive to chicago. I need you to clear a car for me.

131
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,380
- A fugitive? - Yes,that's right.

132
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:35,050
Well,it's just that we're already near capacity...

133
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:37,360
you want him to rub elbows with your other passengers?

134
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,970
- No,sir. - Okay.

135
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:41,930
- What's he wanted for? - Killing people.

136
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,520
Good lord. Make it happen.

137
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,780
All right,come on,follow me.

138
00:08:58,310 --> 00:08:59,950
It's gonna be all right.

139
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:04,490
If you say so.

140
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:09,830
We use him to get what we need,then we dump him.

141
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:14,080
Okay.

142
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,160
I'm sorry you got involved in this.

143
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:25,680
The fact that you're helping us...

144
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,620
means a lot.

145
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:29,930
Thank you.

146
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:38,440
The other riders aren't in any danger,are they?

147
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,710
I mean,should I make an announcement or anything?

148
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:42,670
You want pandemonium?

149
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:44,820
- No,sir. - Okay,then no announcements,right?

150
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:48,200
Just keep everybody out of this car then everything is jake.

151
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:51,040
I've done this a million times. Never had a problem.

152
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,790
Okay,will do.

153
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:05,450
Let's go.

154
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:17,340
We'll be in chicago in about five hours.

155
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:19,480
Want to get some rest.

156
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:39,330
You okay?

157
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,320
Yeah.

158
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,190
Joliet.Illinois Fox River State Penitentiary

159
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:59,150
Brad. You don't look too good.

160
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:02,870
I helped you with sara tancredi, and you were supposed to get me into ad seg.

161
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:04,850
I tried.

162
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,980
But your new warden... Mm...

163
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:11,880
straight as an arrow.

164
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,160
But I might be able to do you one better than ad seg.

165
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:20,560
You found scofield and burrows through the russian girl,right?

166
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,610
Yeah,nika. Why?

167
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:27,300
And you tracked down bagwell by following susan hollander.

168
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,620
Yeah.

169
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:32,060
And I blow my nose with my right hand and I wipe my ass with my left.

170
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:33,660
What of it?

171
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:43,390
I've got very powerful people behind me that want me to finish my job.

172
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:49,090
They can push through the quickest habeas corpus proceedings the courts have ever seen.

173
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,130
Paperwork's sitting on the right person's desk as we speak,

174
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:57,730
setting forth all the constitutional violations in your prosecution.

175
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:02,390
It's just waiting to be rubber-stamped.

176
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:05,780
And what do I have to do?

177
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:08,990
You just find those cons.

178
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:11,730
Only,this time...

179
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:16,710
you're gonna do it for me-- unofficially, under the radar,no paper trail...

180
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:25,290
I need a junkyard dog who's willing to do the ugly things it takes to bring a con to justice.

181
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:31,580
Are you my dog,brad?

182
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:36,670
Damn hell,yeah,I am.

183
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:43,320
This is delicious. What'd you call it again?

184
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:48,300
That,my dear patty-cake,is what my auntie back in 'bama used to call "hobo chicken.

185
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:51,790
" One part chicken,two parts spice,three part actual hobo.

186
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,150
I know,uh,uh...

187
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:03,420
fowl isn't part of a traditional brunch,per se,

188
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:09,150
but I have found a lean meat can act as an aperitif to,uh...

189
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:17,110
awaken the pallet for more subtle flavors and textures,such as...

190
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:20,680
mama mia!

191
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:24,010
Pumpkin cinnamon breads with fresh strawberries and cream.

192
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:26,410
Oh,boy!

193
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:29,190
Now,how did you two meet?

194
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:31,880
Church.

195
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,280
after my,uh...

196
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:40,180
accident,uh,I was volunteering with some other amputees.

197
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:46,580
My parish back home did an exchange program with churches all over this fine country and...

198
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:53,680
well... the good lord just saw fit to plop my country rump right down in the pew beside my susie Q.

199
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:57,830
And you just stole her heart.

200
00:13:57,830 --> 00:14:00,410
I'm a regular one-armed bandit.

201
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:02,430
A one-armed bandit...

202
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:08,020
mrs.Wallace,teddy just bought me a brand-new bike.

203
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:10,150
It's out in the garage. Wanna go see?

204
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:11,560
Sure.

205
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:15,280
- We have got company. - Oh,that's okay.

206
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:19,430
No,it's not; it's rude. Zack knows better. Isn't that right?

207
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:25,270
You do know better,zack.

208
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,620
you gotta have discipline.

209
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:43,550
Without a strong father figure, a young man might just end up in prison.

210
00:14:56,780 --> 00:15:00,780
since you are such a fan of lame store-bought blueberry pie,

211
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:03,120
I am gonna bake you a real pie...

212
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:08,310
hi,my name's lance and I'm an addict.

213
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:17,330
Hi,sara. Hi,my name is not lance,I'm not an addict.

214
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,110
hey,michael...

216
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:34,000
do you know if there's any way  I can get any water?

217
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,190
Yeah,I think there's a bathroom downstairs.

218
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:37,990
I'll check.

219
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Thanks.

220
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:55,390
It was never personal,sara war never is.

221
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,100
Yeah.

222
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,100
sara!

223
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,390

You get one of those.

230
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,100
One.

231
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,900
Get down,right now.

232
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:55,700
What?

233
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:59,500
These three guys said they saw what looked to be a fight going on in there.

234
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:00,790
They didn't,all right?

235
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,090
Just get the train to chicago.

236
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,490
Do I need to notify the police?

237
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,990
You need to do what I just told you to do.

238
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,790
You take the tickets,I'll watch the fugitive.

239
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,390
You guys can just continue to do bong hits,

240
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,990
or whatever you do back there,okay?

241
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,600
Now would you guys mind your own business?

242
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,800
Everybody clear?

243
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,300
Great.

244
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,600
Don't interrupt again,please.

********

246
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,300
If she tries that again...

247
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:26,500
you'll do what?

248
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,600
Just stay on the other side of the car.

249
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,400
It wasn't personal,paul.

250
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:27,000
*****

251
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,500
What're these?

252
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,490
Oh,I'm,uh...

253
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,600
gonna do some renovations.

254
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,200
Uh,I was just tappin' the sheetrock,lookin' for the stud.

255
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:37,000
Looks like you already found one.

256
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,600
Potty mouth!

257
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,790
Me and the girls get together every  friday for book club.

258
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,600
You ought to host it this week and  everybody can meet you.

259
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,200
I'll see you then!

260
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,600
Can't wait.

261
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,800
this ain't ever gonna work here.

262
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,590
Go pack your things;

263
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,900
we're movin'.

264
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:25,600
**********

265
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:34,400
if you don't stop me,I'm gonna eat this whole thing by myself.

266
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:40,800
All right,sweetie,

267
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,300
listen.

268
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,900
I'll make a deal with you.

269
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,500
Remember that merry-go-round that we saw today?

270
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,090
You're not gonna get a chance to ride it,

271
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:52,500
if you don't eat something.

272
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,400
Go ahead.

273
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,200
I don't feel good.

274
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,600
Oh,sweetie.

275
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,300
Okay,come on.

276
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,600
Let's go,all right?

277
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:13,100
I got you.

278
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:17,690
Okay,just hold on.

279
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:18,890
Okay,sweet pea?

280
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:19,900
Check,please?

281
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:20,990
All right!

282
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,300
Nobody move!

283
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:32,900
Hey,sara?

284
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,400
********

285
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,400
how is she?

286
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,000
Well,she wants to be alone.

287
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,890
So we get what her dad locked away with that key.

288
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,200
What do we do then?

289
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:04,100
I mean...

290
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,690
you saw what they did with the tape we made.

291
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,290
They're gonna bury everything we put out there.

292
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,400
That's why we're keeping him close to us.

293
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,800
He's got a lot of connections in washington.

294
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:14,690
So we get to the cigar club,

295
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,300
open her dad's box...

296
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,500
what if the only thing inside's  a bunch of stogies?

297
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,800
I think it's worth making the trip to find out.

298
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:39,690
Yes?

299
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:40,700
Caroline.

300
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:41,690
Paul.

301
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,000
Where are you?

302
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:48,490
I need to know exactly what you meant when you said you were gonna make this right.

303
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,390
I need specifics.

304
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,090
Where are you?

305
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,600
What's that noise?

306
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:54,390
I'm on a train. I'll be in chicago later today.

307
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,200
But I need to know specifics.

308
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,790
Where are burrows and scofield?

309
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:58,890
Are they with you?

310
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,200
Don't worry about them;

311
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:01,490
worry about me.

312
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,390
Paul,

313
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,790
there are still positions in my administration that need to be filled--

314
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,390
including chief of staff.

315
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,500
I want that to be you.

316
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
When I get to chicago,we'll meet.

317
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:13,400
We'll talk.

318
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,400
all of it.

319
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,990
Man,I just brought enough to get a sandwich.

320
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,800
I was sitting right there,okay?

321
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,300
If you're lying...

322
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,290
look,my daughter is sick,

323
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:35,400
and I don't want to spend any more minutes in here than necessary.

324
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,000
Trust me,that is all that I have.

325
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,800
What do you got,sweetheart?

326
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
What do you got?

327
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,100
You don't want to listen?!

328
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:00,590
Hey,hey,calm down,man.

329
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,290
Shut up!

330
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:02,600
-****** -All right.

331
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:05,100
Listen to me,you've got to calm down.

332
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,000
All right,I can help you get  everything that you want.

333
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,800
But you don't want to hurt anybody else,right?

334
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:11,900
Come on.

335
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:14,700
Look,listen.

336
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,590
Why don't you go ahead and lock the door,

337
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,190
and turn the closed sign back,

338
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,200
so everybody thinks that this  place is closed,all right?

339
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:25,000
And then,we can get everybody away from the winw.

340
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:26,200
Is that cool with you?

341
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:27,690
Everybody's away from the window,okay?

342
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:29,790
Let's move everybody onto this side of the room.

343
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:30,990
Get on this side of the room,everybody.

344
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,190
Let's move to this side of the  room from the window.

345
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:33,700
-Move! -Everybody,

346
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,490
let's get on this side of the room,okay?

347
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,590
This side of the room.

348
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,290
Why don't you take my daughter,okay?

349
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:40,790
Take her on this side of the room,so that everybody...

350
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,390
everything is gonna be okay.

351
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,000
Everything is gonna be fine.

352
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,200
Because you're not gonna put your hand on another person,right?

353
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:48,790
RighT.

354
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:49,900
We're all good.

355
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,800
Y'all good?

356
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,500
We're good,right?

357
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,300
Hey,sara?

358
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,100
Come on in.

359
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:24,100
I've been sitting here evaluating.

360
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:27,800
I,uh...

361
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:31,390
I jumped bail.

362
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,000
I'm on the run,

363
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:37,100
and I just tried to take a man's life.

364
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,600
I'm not using.

365
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,600
Which is actually quite an accomplishment.

366
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,800
But three weeks ago,I was a doctor.

367
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,200
You can get that back...

368
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:56,300
all of it.

369
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,700
You need to believe that.

370
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:01,900
You believe that?

371
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,700
You think you can get it all back?

372
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,700
I choose to have faith.

373
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,900
Because without that,I'm nothing.

374
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:21,900
It's the only thing that's keeping me going.

375
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:29,600
I got two things keeping me going.

376
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:33,300
First,is that I want the people who killed my dad.

377
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,200
And actually,the second...

378
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:45,700
ironically,I probably wouldn't even say if I hadn't lost him,but,um...

379
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,400
you should know that...

380
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:02,100
the first thing they tell you  when you take the job,

381
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:06,700
is,um,never to fall in love with an inmate.

382
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,400
what's going on?

383
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:08,300
Roadblock.

384
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:19,090
*****

385
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:20,100
It's locked.

386
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:55,800
You can't be in here.

387
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:05,890
run the roadblock.

388
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:07,290
Man,I can't do that.

389
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:08,100
Run it!

390
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:47,200
bradley bellick,fbi.

391
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:53,600
Brad bellick,federal bureau of investigations.

392
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,300
Brad bellick,fbi.

393
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:59,300
Special agent brad bellick,fbi.

394
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,900
Hi,there,I'm brad bellick with the fbi.

395
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:05,700
I'm an agent with the fbi,brad bellick.

396
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:08,390
Brad bellick.

397
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,700
I'm with the bureau.

398
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:14,700
Brad bellick.I'm with the bureau.

399
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:18,190
I already talked to the cops,told them all I had to say.

400
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,090
Yeah,well,I'm no local hayseed cop.

401
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:21,500
I'm federal.

402
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,800
And you're not going to get away with lying to me.

403
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,690
I didn't lie to nobody.

404
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:26,600
Really?

405
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:30,190
"He was just some homeless guy,hangs around hancock square,"

406
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,290
hitting up college kids for change.

407
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:33,290
"He's down there all the time.

408
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:35,800
If he's not there,I don't know where to find him."

409
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:37,200
That's your statement,right?

410
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:37,890
Pretty much.

411
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:41,890
Right.See,the problem is charles "haywire" patoshik is a paranoid,

412
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:43,490
who suffers from fear of crowds,

413
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:45,290
who's terrified of strangers.

414
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:47,290
If he's anywhere,he's in the middle of nowhere,

415
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:48,990
keeping to himself,being a weirdo.

416
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:49,890
And?

417
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:51,490
And if you want to get tough...

418
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:55,090
how about I arrest you right now for hindering a federal investigation?

419
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:55,990
Who they going to believe?

420
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,390
An agent with 15 years on the force and three presidential citations

421
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:03,800
or a piece of white trash with a juvie record?

422
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:06,700
I didn't ask him to do it,

423
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:07,890
but in case you haven't noticed,

424
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:10,700
I ain't exactly broken up over my stepdad's death.

425
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:13,090
Why can't you just leave this patoshik guy alone?

426
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:14,100
Where is he?

427
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:16,900
Or do you want to get locked up...

428
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:18,500
right now?

429
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:26,600
yeah.

430
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,090
I got a lead on patoshik.

431
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:28,900
Where?

432
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:31,700
I'm on my way.

433
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,500
Keep him there.

434
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:34,900
AlonE.

435
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:41,290
Any information on scofield and burrows,

436
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:43,000
I want to be notified immediately.

437
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:44,600
If that works out for you.

438
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:52,090
They're gonna have cops waiting for us at the next station.

439
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:53,270
We need to jump then.

440
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:54,910
And do what?

441
00:30:55,010 --> 00:30:56,570
Hide under a barrel?

442
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:58,500
Linc's right.

443
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:05,860
Okay,you just put those in there.

444
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:08,590
I'm so sorry about all this.

445
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,720
It's okay,sweet pea.

446
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:17,740
Here's everything right here,man.

447
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,430
It's good.

448
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:26,400
All right,everyone in the storage room.Now.

449
00:31:26,450 --> 00:31:27,930
What?

450
00:31:28,010 --> 00:31:31,640
Get back there until the cops show up.

451
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,820
No,no,no,no,I can't go back there.

452
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:34,660
Come on.

453
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:35,680
No.

454
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:37,340
Look,you kept a cool head this whole time.

455
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:38,810
Don't get yourself killed now.

456
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:40,510
You know what?Listen to me.

457
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:44,720
I'm a wanted man.Okay?

458
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:46,990
If the police show up here,they'll take me back to prison,

459
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:48,680
and you know what?That's fine.

460
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:50,450
But my little girl right here?

461
00:31:50,490 --> 00:31:51,780
She's sick.

462
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:54,180
And she's going to be left alone.

463
00:31:55,540 --> 00:32:00,990
And I can't let that happen,so can you please let us go?

464
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:14,630
Go!

465
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:16,190
Come on.This way.

466
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:18,100
Let's go.

467
00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:20,510
all right,everyone in the back.

468
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:22,410
Move.

469
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:23,800
Not yoU.

470
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:26,310
- No! - You're coming with me.

471
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:27,190
Go on.

472
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,740
Move.

473
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:31,670
Okay,I want you to stay right here,okay?

474
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:34,960
Go on!

475
00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:36,800
Hey.

476
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:40,700
I think you should let her go,man.

477
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:42,910
take off.Last chance.

478
00:32:42,970 --> 00:32:44,960
You've got the money.

479
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:45,910
Burglary and assault.

480
00:32:45,970 --> 00:32:48,290
Man,hey,that's change,man,that's little time.

481
00:32:48,330 --> 00:32:50,350
But this right here...

482
00:32:50,410 --> 00:32:52,490
you will be in prison for the rest of your life.

483
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:53,700
Believe me on that.

484
00:32:53,770 --> 00:32:58,750
Unless you want your daughter to see you die,move.

485
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:05,170
I'm trying to help you,man!

486
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:09,540
come here!

487
00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:18,200
sweetie,stay right there.

488
00:33:22,690 --> 00:33:24,270
oh,no.

489
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:40,230
who did this?

490
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:45,880
I did.

491
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:57,980
Thank you.

492
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:11,180
Bellick: Haywire!

493
00:34:11,350 --> 00:34:13,370
Don't move!

494
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:15,560
Run!Larry!Run!

495
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:17,460
Hurry!Hurry!

496
00:34:27,910 --> 00:34:29,460
Dino,it's eric.

497
00:34:29,530 --> 00:34:30,940
We've got four jumpers.

498
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,620
Three males and a female.

499
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:34,710
Call it in and get us to the next station.

500
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:35,810
Do you hear me?

501
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,870
Get us to the next station.

502
00:34:40,810 --> 00:34:42,700
The men who pushed through the roadblock are jumping off

503
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:47,220
the train near mile marker 54,just south of the tedford bridge.

504
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:29,740
freeze!

505
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:32,850
Don't shoot!Don't shoot!

506
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:34,680
Turn around!

507
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:38,890
I'm an employee of the train company.

508
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:40,310
Dino,it's eric.

509
00:35:40,370 --> 00:35:41,750
We've got four jumpers.

510
00:35:41,810 --> 00:35:42,810
Three males and a female.

511
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:44,460
Call it in and get us to the next station.

512
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,300
Let's go.

513
00:35:45,350 --> 00:35:46,920
Come on.

514
00:35:47,990 --> 00:35:52,270
They told us to jump and run and not to look back or they'd shoot us.

515
00:35:57,970 --> 00:35:59,790
We need to find a car.

516
00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:45,900
yeah.I got haywire trapped.

517
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:47,400
Don't do anything.

518
00:36:47,470 --> 00:36:49,230
Just hold him until I get there.

519
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:50,010
No problem.

520
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:52,260
I got this wingnut treed.

521
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:16,370
caroline.

522
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,790
Paul,where are you?

523
00:37:17,870 --> 00:37:19,300
Did you send the police?

524
00:37:19,390 --> 00:37:21,420
No,of course not.

525
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,470
How did they know I was on that train?

526
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:25,780
Paul,I have no idea.

527
00:37:25,830 --> 00:37:27,120
I'll let the president know.

528
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:29,570
I contact the president directly.

529
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:32,810
Are burrows and scofield with you?

530
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:36,060
I was expecting to brief the president.

531
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:39,030
You report to me now.

532
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:41,410
Paul?

533
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:45,300
Where did we spend my 35th birthday?

534
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,840
What?

535
00:37:46,910 --> 00:37:48,290
The restaurant.

536
00:37:48,370 --> 00:37:50,020
Where was it?You remember.

537
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:51,940
Don't be ridiculous.I have to go.

538
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:52,910
Do not hang up.

539
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:54,110
I have to go.

540
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:55,740
Just get burrows and scofield...

541
00:37:55,770 --> 00:37:57,420
hey.

542
00:37:57,470 --> 00:38:04,030
Whoever this is...tell bill kim that he just screwed up...big-time.

543
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:09,210
Paul?Paul?

544
00:38:36,570 --> 00:38:38,060
What's all this?

545
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:42,460
Some whacko climbs up to a grain elevator,people want to watch.

546
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:44,870
(oh,god,you we supposed to keep a handle on things.

547
00:38:44,930 --> 00:38:46,510
Do you know what that means?

548
00:38:46,570 --> 00:38:48,060
I got you haywire.

549
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:50,180
What else do you want?

550
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:53,190
FbI.He's my chargee.

551
00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:28,460
How you doing,charles?

552
00:39:29,310 --> 00:39:31,900
I don't want to go back to prison.

553
00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:34,340
I don't blame you.

554
00:39:34,890 --> 00:39:36,910
I want to go to holland.

555
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:39,920
That's not what i expected to hear.

556
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,830
But you can't go there,son.

557
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:44,670
I just...

558
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:51,920
I just want to go...here.

559
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:54,410
See?

560
00:39:58,390 --> 00:40:00,730
Yeah.I'll tell you what.

561
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:04,950
You don't have to go to prison.

562
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,890
But you can't go to holland,either.

563
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:10,890
Oh,no,no,no,no,no,no.

564
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:12,710
It's okay,it's okay,it's okay.

565
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:16,020
Hey,you're in a tough spot.

566
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:18,040
You feel trapped,you got no options,and...

567
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:21,360
caught in a situation where you have no control.

568
00:40:21,770 --> 00:40:23,710
I know how you feel.

569
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:25,830
I do.

570
00:40:26,170 --> 00:40:29,770
It takes its toll on you,and all you want to do is run.

571
00:40:33,170 --> 00:40:34,710
But run where?

572
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:37,740
I just want to go.

573
00:40:41,210 --> 00:40:43,390
There's a way out.

574
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:47,820
A way out?

575
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:52,740
- Yeah. - Of this maze?

576
00:40:54,750 --> 00:40:56,370
Yeah.

577
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:59,070
Chicago,Illinois

578
00:41:01,590 --> 00:41:03,750
There are private humidors in the back.

579
00:41:03,770 --> 00:41:05,790
Each member's name is on their box.

580
00:41:05,810 --> 00:41:06,790
Any security?

581
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:07,920
A receptionist.

582
00:41:07,950 --> 00:41:09,700
That's it.

583
00:41:09,730 --> 00:41:11,810
I'm not a wanted fugitive.

584
00:41:11,850 --> 00:41:13,830
Give me the key.I'll do it.

585
00:41:17,290 --> 00:41:19,180
Want to take a walk?

586
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:20,640
Yeah.

587
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:23,880
I know you killed your parents because they hurt you.

588
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:27,900
And I know you killed that guy yesterday because he was hurting sasha,

589
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:32,470
but what you did...was wrong.

590
00:41:32,550 --> 00:41:35,200
You know that.

591
00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:39,310
I just want to go.

592
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:44,240
You caN.

593
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:48,090
I want to go now.

594
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:02,840
it's okay.

595
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,880
Sara.

596
00:42:28,210 --> 00:42:30,720
Um...about before.

597
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,580
Me,too.

598
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:41,460
Yeah.
