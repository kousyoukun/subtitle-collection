1
00:00:00,843 --> 00:00:02,709
Where is it?
Go to hell.

2
00:00:02,776 --> 00:00:05,477
You did this to yourself.

3
00:00:05,542 --> 00:00:06,876
MICHAEL:
Sara, if you're listening,

4
00:00:06,943 --> 00:00:08,843
I only hope, by now,
you've found your safe haven.

5
00:00:08,909 --> 00:00:11,477
I took advantage of you,
put you in a place

6
00:00:11,542 --> 00:00:13,210
that's every doctor's nightmare.

7
00:00:13,276 --> 00:00:15,043
Sara Tancredi.
You know her well?

8
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:17,276
I'd know her a lot better
if you can get my ass moved.

9
00:00:17,343 --> 00:00:18,276
I'll talk to the warden.

10
00:00:18,343 --> 00:00:19,876
"Another Chance"
and "Safe Haven."

11
00:00:19,943 --> 00:00:21,843
Those are the names
of some of the chapters

12
00:00:21,909 --> 00:00:23,709
in the book they use an AA.

13
00:00:23,776 --> 00:00:25,542
Make no mistake about it.

14
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:29,509
We will be a family
if it kills us.

15
00:00:29,576 --> 00:00:31,709
That's your map?
Mm-hmm.

16
00:00:31,776 --> 00:00:33,642
What happened
to your arm?

17
00:00:33,709 --> 00:00:34,843
My dad drinks, too.

18
00:00:36,943 --> 00:00:38,909
My tummy hurts.

19
00:00:38,976 --> 00:00:40,843
She needs that medicine.
She can't go

20
00:00:40,909 --> 00:00:42,310
two days without it.

21
00:00:42,377 --> 00:00:43,176
DARIUS:
 <i>Kacee's going</i>
 <i>into the system now.</i>

22
00:00:43,243 --> 00:00:44,843
 <i>Aiding an escaped con.</i>

23
00:00:44,909 --> 00:00:46,377
Tell her lawyer
I'll turn myself in.

24
00:00:46,443 --> 00:00:47,676
Kacee said you need to run.

25
00:00:47,743 --> 00:00:48,876
If you get busted
or turn yourself in,

26
00:00:48,943 --> 00:00:50,743
 <i>Dede won't have</i>
 <i>either of you.</i>

27
00:00:50,809 --> 00:00:52,509
Michael,
I want for this to be over.

28
00:00:52,576 --> 00:00:53,509
That makes two of us.

29
00:00:53,576 --> 00:00:54,843
It's just a question

30
00:00:54,909 --> 00:00:55,542
of looking at whatever it is
your father gave you.

31
00:00:55,609 --> 00:00:57,509
It's just a key.

32
00:00:57,576 --> 00:00:59,509
If I may, sir, the president...

33
00:00:59,576 --> 00:01:00,542
 <i>she could be useful.</i>

34
00:01:00,609 --> 00:01:02,010
Madam President?

35
00:01:02,076 --> 00:01:03,310
REYNOLDS:
I want you to come home, Paul.

36
00:01:03,377 --> 00:01:05,343
We can fix this,

37
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:07,542
 <i>but not with those brothers</i>
 <i>running around the country.</i>

38
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:08,876
Caroline...

39
00:01:08,943 --> 00:01:10,676
 <i>Bring them in, Paul,</i>
 <i>and everything</i>

40
00:01:10,743 --> 00:01:12,276
can go back to the way it was.

41
00:01:37,909 --> 00:01:39,676
Agent Kellerman.

42
00:01:39,743 --> 00:01:42,110
REYNOLDS:
Paul, where are you?

43
00:01:42,176 --> 00:01:43,676
KELLERMAN:
Out in the cold. Remember?

44
00:01:43,743 --> 00:01:45,876
I'm speaking in Chicago tonight.

45
00:01:59,576 --> 00:02:01,043
Lincoln.

46
00:02:02,143 --> 00:02:03,709
Sara.

47
00:02:03,776 --> 00:02:05,876
KELLERMAN:
It's funny how you only call me

48
00:02:05,943 --> 00:02:07,276
when you need me.

49
00:02:07,343 --> 00:02:08,576
Maybe "funny"
is not the right word.

50
00:02:08,642 --> 00:02:10,743
All of this can go away, Paul.

51
00:02:10,809 --> 00:02:12,642
Can it?

52
00:02:12,709 --> 00:02:15,609
Yes. I'm the President
of the United States.

53
00:02:15,676 --> 00:02:17,609
Please just come back to Chicago

54
00:02:17,676 --> 00:02:20,143
and turn Burrows
and Scofield in.

55
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:22,477
I promise you that I will make
everything go back

56
00:02:22,542 --> 00:02:24,676
to the way it was.

57
00:02:24,743 --> 00:02:26,010
KELLERMAN:
I have to go.

58
00:02:26,076 --> 00:02:28,909
Just come back, Paul.

59
00:02:28,976 --> 00:02:30,676
I need you.

60
00:02:32,709 --> 00:02:33,943
You actually think
we have a shot?

61
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:37,509
It depends on what
your father gave you.

62
00:02:37,576 --> 00:02:39,609
This fell out of his pocket 
when I found him.

63
00:02:39,676 --> 00:02:43,576
I don't recognize
the insignia, do you?

64
00:02:43,642 --> 00:02:46,243
No.

65
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:47,243
But, uh...

66
00:02:49,743 --> 00:02:53,809
Sara, we've got someone
working with us now.

67
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:07,443
Good morning, sunshine.

68
00:03:11,509 --> 00:03:13,310
How did you sleep?

69
00:03:18,443 --> 00:03:20,609
I'll tell you what.

70
00:03:20,676 --> 00:03:23,509
I'll go unlock the kids
and make us all breakfast.

71
00:03:23,576 --> 00:03:24,477
No. I'll get the kids.

72
00:03:24,542 --> 00:03:26,576
No...
Tu-tut-tut. I insist.

73
00:03:26,642 --> 00:03:29,377
No.

74
00:03:45,743 --> 00:03:48,176
 <i>I'll</i> get the kids.

75
00:03:51,609 --> 00:03:55,110
Some hand cream will make
them rope burns feel better.

76
00:03:55,176 --> 00:03:57,043
It won't work.

77
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:58,410
'Course it will.

78
00:03:58,477 --> 00:04:00,509
Says right here on the bottle:
"Soothes skin

79
00:04:00,576 --> 00:04:03,010
irritations and..."
No. This.

80
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,377
It won't work.
I've got a job.

81
00:04:04,443 --> 00:04:06,276
The kids have school.

82
00:04:06,343 --> 00:04:07,542
We're all going
to get back

83
00:04:07,609 --> 00:04:09,010
to our normal routines

84
00:04:09,076 --> 00:04:12,043
once this little
adjustment period is over.

85
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:13,377
There's someone
coming over today.

86
00:04:13,443 --> 00:04:14,243
Who?

87
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:15,276
This woman, Patty,

88
00:04:15,343 --> 00:04:16,709
from the Welcome Wagon
Committee.

89
00:04:16,776 --> 00:04:17,909
Call her and cancel.

90
00:04:17,976 --> 00:04:19,909
I don't have her number.

91
00:04:19,976 --> 00:04:22,210
And, if she shows up,
and I don't answer the door,

92
00:04:22,276 --> 00:04:24,377
she's going
to know something's wrong.

93
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:31,776
Teddy...

94
00:04:34,809 --> 00:04:36,310
Teddy Bear...

95
00:04:36,377 --> 00:04:38,809
you need to go.

96
00:04:38,876 --> 00:04:42,276
If she recognizes you...

97
00:04:44,776 --> 00:04:47,909
I don't want you
to get in trouble.

98
00:04:54,642 --> 00:04:56,743
That's nonsense.

99
00:04:56,809 --> 00:04:59,776
It's no trouble.

100
00:05:03,642 --> 00:05:05,976
No trouble at all.

101
00:05:14,909 --> 00:05:16,110
Hi, Sara.

102
00:05:16,176 --> 00:05:17,509
What's done is done.

103
00:05:17,576 --> 00:05:19,443
We all want
the same thing.

104
00:05:22,542 --> 00:05:24,509
You didn't tell us
you left her to die.

105
00:05:24,576 --> 00:05:26,976
(choking):
I was scaring her.

106
00:05:29,343 --> 00:05:32,110
No. No, you left me
in there to drown.

107
00:05:32,176 --> 00:05:33,310
I wonder how long
you can hold your breath.

108
00:05:33,377 --> 00:05:35,143
Maybe we should find out.

109
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:37,176
You need me,
and you know it.

110
00:05:38,576 --> 00:05:39,976
You need me. You need me.
You need me.

111
00:05:42,776 --> 00:05:44,542
Why? Why do we need him?
We have the key.

112
00:05:44,609 --> 00:05:46,743
We'll find out
what it's for.
You're right.

113
00:05:46,809 --> 00:05:49,043
I can tell you what
that key's for right now.

114
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:54,276
It's to a private cigar club.

115
00:05:54,343 --> 00:05:56,143
Where?

116
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:59,243
Chicago.

Enjoy !

121
00:06:32,925 --> 00:06:36,258
We have to hurry.

122
00:06:36,325 --> 00:06:37,592
We have to hurry, Larry.

123
00:06:37,658 --> 00:06:39,225
I did a bad thing.

124
00:06:40,725 --> 00:06:43,458
God! I did a very bad thing.

125
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:51,991
All gas stations:
on 80, 30, 77.

126
00:06:52,058 --> 00:06:53,959
I want Scofield's
and Burrows' pictures

127
00:06:54,024 --> 00:06:55,825
on each and every gas pump.

128
00:06:55,892 --> 00:06:58,758
If they have no fuel,
they can't get anywhere.
Sir?

129
00:06:58,825 --> 00:07:00,492
What?
We might need
to divert

130
00:07:00,558 --> 00:07:03,058
our attention away 
from Scofield and
Burrows for a while.

131
00:07:03,124 --> 00:07:04,358
Why would I do that?

132
00:07:04,425 --> 00:07:06,291
Because one of the other
escapees just killed a civilian.

133
00:07:07,558 --> 00:07:10,458
A man fitting
his description

134
00:07:10,525 --> 00:07:13,525
wasspotted running from the
scene of a brutal homicide.

135
00:07:13,592 --> 00:07:15,458
Happened in Algoma,
Wisconsin,

136
00:07:15,525 --> 00:07:17,859
less than four hours
from the prison.

137
00:07:17,925 --> 00:07:19,625
Call the field office
in Madison,

138
00:07:19,692 --> 00:07:21,291
and have them get some agents
out there right away.

139
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:22,358
Okay. I'll notify
headquarters.

140
00:07:22,425 --> 00:07:23,892
I didn't say headquarters.

141
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:25,925
I said, are you not following
direct orders?

142
00:07:25,991 --> 00:07:29,458
Oh, I am following
direct orders, sir.

143
00:07:29,525 --> 00:07:32,625
Just not from you anymore.

144
00:07:32,692 --> 00:07:35,658
Everything goes through
headquarters from now on.

145
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:38,725
May I?

146
00:07:48,792 --> 00:07:49,792
Yeah.

147
00:07:49,859 --> 00:07:51,991
You heard about Patoshik.

148
00:07:52,058 --> 00:07:53,291
Just now.

149
00:07:53,358 --> 00:07:55,458
Good.

150
00:07:55,525 --> 00:07:57,191
He goes.

151
00:07:57,258 --> 00:07:58,625
Come on,
the man is mentally ill.

152
00:07:58,692 --> 00:08:00,091
He doesn't know anything,
he's not a threat...

153
00:08:00,158 --> 00:08:02,892
Patoshik was one of Scofield's
cellmates for awhile.

154
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:04,391
Scofield included him
in the escape.

155
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:05,558
Who knows what he knows?

156
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:06,925
Scofield and Burrows
are still out there.

157
00:08:06,991 --> 00:08:08,391
Don't worry about Scofield
and Burrows right now.

158
00:08:10,124 --> 00:08:13,358
So, again...

159
00:08:13,425 --> 00:08:15,525
Patoshik goes.

160
00:08:15,592 --> 00:08:18,492
Take care of it.

161
00:08:21,391 --> 00:08:23,258
Hi, are you in
charge of seating?

162
00:08:23,325 --> 00:08:24,592
Yeah, can I help you?

163
00:08:24,658 --> 00:08:27,258
Agent Paul Kellerman,
Secret Service.

164
00:08:27,325 --> 00:08:28,658
I'm transporting a fugitive
to Chicago.

165
00:08:28,725 --> 00:08:30,525
I need you to clear
a car for me.

166
00:08:30,592 --> 00:08:32,258
A fugitive?
Yes, that's right.

167
00:08:32,325 --> 00:08:33,358
Well, it's just

168
00:08:33,425 --> 00:08:35,091
that we're already
near capacity...

169
00:08:35,158 --> 00:08:37,391
You want him to rub elbows
with your other passengers?

170
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:38,792
No, sir.
Okay.

171
00:08:38,859 --> 00:08:40,225
What's he wanted for?

172
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:41,959
Killing people.

173
00:08:42,024 --> 00:08:43,158
Good Lord.

174
00:08:43,225 --> 00:08:44,291
Make it happen.

175
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:46,325
All right, come on,
follow me.

176
00:08:58,492 --> 00:09:00,458
It's gonna be all right.

177
00:09:01,525 --> 00:09:04,124
If you say so.

178
00:09:06,091 --> 00:09:08,191
We use him to get what we need,

179
00:09:08,258 --> 00:09:10,725
then we dump him.

180
00:09:11,758 --> 00:09:13,625
Okay.

181
00:09:19,024 --> 00:09:21,592
I'm sorry you got involved
in this.

182
00:09:23,658 --> 00:09:26,058
The fact that
you're helping us...

183
00:09:26,124 --> 00:09:28,058
means a lot.

184
00:09:28,124 --> 00:09:30,391
Thank you.

185
00:09:35,792 --> 00:09:38,358
The other riders aren't
in any danger, are they?

186
00:09:38,425 --> 00:09:40,391
I mean, should I make an
announcement or anything?

187
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:42,692
You want pandemonium?

188
00:09:42,758 --> 00:09:44,758
No, sir.
Okay, then
no announcements, right?

189
00:09:46,058 --> 00:09:47,358
Just keep everybody out
of this car

190
00:09:47,425 --> 00:09:48,458
then everything is jake.

191
00:09:48,525 --> 00:09:49,692
I've done this a million times.

192
00:09:49,758 --> 00:09:50,825
Never had a problem.

193
00:09:50,892 --> 00:09:53,024
Okay, will do.

194
00:10:04,325 --> 00:10:06,291
KELLERMAN:
Let's go.

195
00:10:14,558 --> 00:10:17,458
KELLERMAN:
We'll be in Chicago
in about five hours.

196
00:10:17,525 --> 00:10:19,492
Want to get some rest.

197
00:10:37,258 --> 00:10:39,358
You okay?

198
00:10:39,425 --> 00:10:41,425
Yeah.

199
00:10:56,725 --> 00:10:57,792
Brad.

200
00:10:57,859 --> 00:10:59,825
(laughing):
You don't look too good.

201
00:10:59,892 --> 00:11:01,058
I helped you with Sara Tancredi,

202
00:11:01,124 --> 00:11:02,725
and you were supposed
to get me into Ad Seg.

203
00:11:02,792 --> 00:11:06,325
I tried.

204
00:11:06,391 --> 00:11:10,358
But your new warden...
mm...

205
00:11:10,425 --> 00:11:11,825
straight as an arrow.

206
00:11:11,892 --> 00:11:16,558
But I might be able to do you
one better than Ad Seg.

207
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:20,758
You found Scofield and Burrows
through the Russian girl, right?

208
00:11:20,825 --> 00:11:23,191
Yeah, Nika. Why?

209
00:11:23,258 --> 00:11:27,792
And you tracked down Bagwell
by following Susan Hollander.

210
00:11:27,859 --> 00:11:30,391
Yeah. And I blow my nose
with my right hand

211
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:32,058
and I wipe my ass with my left.

212
00:11:32,124 --> 00:11:33,892
What of it?

213
00:11:38,692 --> 00:11:41,692
I've got very powerful people
behind me

214
00:11:41,758 --> 00:11:44,758
that want me to finish my job.

215
00:11:44,825 --> 00:11:46,525
They can push through
the quickest

216
00:11:46,592 --> 00:11:49,625
habeas corpus proceedings
the courts have ever seen.

217
00:11:49,692 --> 00:11:52,892
Paperwork's sitting on
the right person's
desk as we speak,

218
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,892
setting forth all

219
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:57,959
the Constitutional violations
in your prosecution.

220
00:11:59,692 --> 00:12:02,425
It's just waiting
to be rubber-stamped.

221
00:12:02,492 --> 00:12:06,225
And what do I have to do?

222
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:09,758
You just find those cons.

223
00:12:09,825 --> 00:12:11,658
Only, this time...

224
00:12:11,725 --> 00:12:13,325
you're gonna do it for me--

225
00:12:13,391 --> 00:12:18,825
unofficially, under the radar,
no paper trail...

226
00:12:18,892 --> 00:12:22,391
I need a junkyard dog who's
willing to do the ugly things

227
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:25,758
it takes to bring a con
to justice.

228
00:12:29,425 --> 00:12:31,391
Are you my dog, Brad?

229
00:12:34,525 --> 00:12:37,625
Damn hell, yeah, I am.

230
00:12:40,825 --> 00:12:42,091
PATTY:
This is delicious.

231
00:12:42,158 --> 00:12:43,825
What'd you
call it again?

232
00:12:43,892 --> 00:12:45,325
That, my dear Patty-cake,

233
00:12:45,391 --> 00:12:48,492
is what my auntie back in 'Bama
used to call "hobo chicken."

234
00:12:48,558 --> 00:12:51,859
One part chicken, two parts
spice, three part actual hobo.

235
00:12:55,925 --> 00:12:59,991
T-BAG:
I know, uh, uh... fowl

236
00:13:00,058 --> 00:13:03,959
isn't part of
a traditional brunch, per se,

237
00:13:04,024 --> 00:13:06,558
but I have found
a lean meat

238
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:10,225
can act as an
aperitif to, uh...

239
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:14,325
awaken the pallet
for more subtle

240
00:13:14,391 --> 00:13:16,859
flavors and textures,

241
00:13:16,925 --> 00:13:19,225
such as...
(inhales sharply)

242
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:20,525
Mama mia!

243
00:13:20,592 --> 00:13:22,492
Pumpkin cinnamon breads

244
00:13:22,558 --> 00:13:25,458
with fresh strawberries
and cream.

245
00:13:25,525 --> 00:13:26,525
PATTY:
Oh, boy!

246
00:13:26,592 --> 00:13:28,725
Mmm! Now, how did
you two meet?

247
00:13:29,758 --> 00:13:31,525
Church.

248
00:13:31,592 --> 00:13:32,825
Mm!

249
00:13:33,892 --> 00:13:36,725
After my, uh... accident,

250
00:13:36,792 --> 00:13:40,158
uh, I was volunteering
with some other amputees.

251
00:13:40,225 --> 00:13:41,825
My parish back home

252
00:13:41,892 --> 00:13:45,658
did an exchange program
with churches all over

253
00:13:45,725 --> 00:13:47,725
this fine country
and... well...

254
00:13:47,792 --> 00:13:49,024
the good Lord

255
00:13:49,091 --> 00:13:51,225
just saw fit to plop
my country rump

256
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:53,959
right down in the pew
beside my Susie Q.

257
00:13:56,058 --> 00:13:57,859
And you just stole her heart.

258
00:13:57,925 --> 00:14:00,091
I'm a regular one-armed bandit.

259
00:14:00,158 --> 00:14:01,925
(wheezing laugh):
A one-armed bandit...

260
00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:07,792
Mrs. Wallace, Teddy just
bought me a brand-new bike.

261
00:14:07,859 --> 00:14:09,991
It's out in the garage.
Wanna go see?

262
00:14:12,291 --> 00:14:14,124
T-BAG:
We have got company.

263
00:14:14,191 --> 00:14:15,859
Oh, that's okay.

264
00:14:15,925 --> 00:14:18,058
No, it's not; it's rude.
Zack knows better.

265
00:14:18,124 --> 00:14:19,458
Isn't that right?

266
00:14:22,692 --> 00:14:25,525
You do know better, Zack.

267
00:14:35,925 --> 00:14:37,525
You gotta have discipline.

268
00:14:37,592 --> 00:14:40,425
Without a strong
father figure,

269
00:14:40,492 --> 00:14:44,124
a young man might just
end up in prison.

270
00:14:56,725 --> 00:14:58,258
 <i>Since you are such a fan </i>

271
00:14:58,325 --> 00:15:00,959
of lame store-bought
blueberry pie,

272
00:15:01,024 --> 00:15:02,925
I am gonna bake you
a real pie...

273
00:15:06,358 --> 00:15:07,959
Hi, my name's Lance
and I'm an addict.

274
00:15:08,024 --> 00:15:09,692
GROUP:
Hi, Lance.

275
00:15:11,558 --> 00:15:13,425
Hi, Sara.

276
00:15:14,991 --> 00:15:17,191
Hi, my name is not Lance,
I'm not an addict.

277
00:15:29,291 --> 00:15:31,291
Hey, Michael...

278
00:15:31,358 --> 00:15:34,792
Do you know if there's any way
I can get any water?

279
00:15:34,859 --> 00:15:37,091
Yeah, I think there's
a bathroom downstairs.

280
00:15:37,158 --> 00:15:39,158
I'll check.
Thanks.

281
00:15:52,492 --> 00:15:53,991
It was never
personal, Sara.

282
00:15:54,058 --> 00:15:55,525
War never is.

283
00:15:55,592 --> 00:15:56,892
Yeah.

284
00:16:28,885 --> 00:16:30,352
Sara!
(Sara grunting)

285
00:16:39,965 --> 00:16:43,065
You get one of those!
You get one of those.

286
00:16:43,132 --> 00:16:44,265
One.

287
00:16:44,332 --> 00:16:45,998
One.

288
00:16:47,232 --> 00:16:48,465
Down.
Get down, right now.

289
00:16:54,499 --> 00:16:55,598
What?

290
00:16:55,664 --> 00:16:57,564
These three guys
said they saw

291
00:16:57,631 --> 00:16:59,831
what looked to be a fight
going on in there.

292
00:16:59,898 --> 00:17:01,998
They didn't, all right?
Just get the train to Chicago.

293
00:17:02,065 --> 00:17:03,332
Do I need to notify the police?

294
00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:04,931
You need to do what
I just told you to do.

295
00:17:04,998 --> 00:17:06,664
You take the tickets,
I'll watch the fugitive.

296
00:17:06,731 --> 00:17:08,432
You guys can just
continue to do bong hits,

297
00:17:08,499 --> 00:17:09,831
or whatever you do
back there, okay?

298
00:17:09,898 --> 00:17:11,298
Now would you guys
mind your own business?

299
00:17:11,365 --> 00:17:13,499
Everybody clear?

300
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,200
Great.

301
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,200
Don't interrupt again, please.

302
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:22,100
Just so we're all clear:

303
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,200
if she tries
that again...

304
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:26,500
You'll do what?

305
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:28,400
Just stay on the other side
of the car.

306
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,300
It wasn't personal, Paul.

307
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,600
Yeah.

308
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,900
???

309
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,300
Ooh! What're these?

310
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,500
Oh, I'm, uh...

311
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,300
gonna do some renovations.

312
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:34,200
Uh, I was just tappin' the
sheetrock, lookin' for the stud.

313
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,600
Looks like you
already found one.

314
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Whoo! Potty mouth!

315
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,600
PATTY:
Oh!

316
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:45,700
Me and the girls get together
every Friday for book club.

317
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,400
You ought to host it this week
and everybody can meet you.

318
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,300
I'll see you then!

319
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:51,800
(flatly):
Can't wait.
PATTY:
Uh-huh!

320
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,500
This ain't ever gonna work here.

321
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,600
Go pack your things;
we're movin'.

322
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,300
Now, hey, if you
don't stop me,

323
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:34,100
I'm gonna eat this
whole thing by myself.

324
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,400
Huh?

325
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,200
All right,
sweetie, listen.

326
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,700
I'll make a deal with you.

327
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,500
Remember that merry-go-round
that we saw today?

328
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:51,100
You're not gonna get
a chance to ride it,
if you don't

329
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,100
eat something. Go ahead.

330
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:55,200
I don't feel good.

331
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,700
Oh, sweetie.

332
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:08,900
Okay, come on.

333
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,500
Let's go,
all right?

334
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:13,600
I got you.

335
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,700
Okay, just hold on.
Okay, sweet pea?

336
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,000
(door bell jangles)
C-NOTE:
Check, please?

337
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,000
All right! Nobody move!

338
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,200
Hey, Sara?

339
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,900
How is she?

340
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:57,000
Well, she wants to be alone.

341
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:02,200
So we get what her dad
locked away with that key.

342
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,200
What do we do then?

343
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:06,100
I mean... you saw what they did
with the tape we made.

344
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,500
They're gonna bury everything
we put out there.

345
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,100
That's why we're keeping him
close to us.

346
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,300
He's got a lot of
connections in Washington.

347
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,300
MICHAEL:
Mm-hmm.

348
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:16,100
So we get to the cigar club,
open her dad's box...

349
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:19,100
what if the only thing inside's
a bunch of stogies?

350
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,600
I think it's worth making
the trip to find out.

351
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:39,800
REYNOLDS:
Yes?

352
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:40,800
Caroline.

353
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,800
Paul. Where are you?

354
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,000
I need to know
exactly what you meant

355
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:48,200
when you said you were gonna
make this right.

356
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,600
I need specifics.

357
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:51,300
Where are you?
What's that noise?

358
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:54,100
I'm on a train.
I'll be in Chicago later today.

359
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:55,900
But I need to know specifics.

360
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,200
Where are Burrows and Scofield?

361
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:59,000
Are they with you?

362
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:01,400
Don't worry about them;
worry about me.

363
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,500
Paul, there are still positions
in my administration

364
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:07,700
that need to be filled--
including Chief of Staff.

365
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,300
I want that to be you.

366
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:11,600
When I get to Chicago,
we'll meet.

367
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:13,900
We'll talk.

368
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,500
All of it.

369
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,200
Man, I just brought
enough to get a sandwich.

370
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:27,500
I was sitting
right there, okay?

371
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,300
If you're lying...

372
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,300
Look, my daughter is sick,
and I don't want to spend

373
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,900
any more minutes in
here than necessary.

374
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,800
Trust me, that is all
that I have.

375
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,500
What do you got,
sweetheart?

376
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,100
What do you got?

377
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,000
You don't want to listen?!

378
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:00,600
Hey, hey,
calm down, man.

379
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:01,300
Shut up!

380
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:02,800
All right.

381
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:04,800
Listen to me,
you've got to calm down.

382
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,500
All right, I can help
you get everything
that you want.

383
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,500
But you don't want to
hurt anybody else, right?

384
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,200
Come on.

385
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,200
Look, listen. Hey.

386
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,700
Why don't you go ahead
and lock the door,

387
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,100
and turn the
closed sign back,

388
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,800
so everybody thinks that this
place is closed, all right?

389
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,500
And then, we can
get everybody away
from the window.

390
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:26,000
Is that cool with you?

391
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,100
Everybody's away
from the window, okay?
Yeah.

392
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,600
Let's move everybody onto
this side of the room.

393
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,100
Get on this side of
the room, everybody.

394
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,400
Let's move to this
side of the room
from the window.

395
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:34,700
Move!
Everybody, let's get
on this side of
the room, okay?

396
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,400
This side of the room.

397
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,200
Why don't you take
my daughter, okay?

398
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:39,600
Take her on this side
of the room,

399
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:42,000
so that everybody...
everything is gonna be okay.

400
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,500
Everything is gonna be fine.

401
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,700
Because you're not
gonna put your hand

402
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:46,900
on another person, right?

403
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,800
Right. We're all good.

404
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:50,500
Yeah.

405
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,800
Y'all good?

406
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,400
We're good, right?

407
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:00,600
Hey, Sara?

408
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:01,600
Come on in.

409
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:10,300
Hey.

410
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,700
I've been sitting here
evaluating.

411
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,600
I, uh...

412
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,600
I jumped bail.

413
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:32,900
I'm on the run,

414
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,900
and I just tried
to take a man's life.

415
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,800
I'm not using.

416
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:45,600
Which is actually
quite an accomplishment.

417
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:51,700
But three weeks ago,
I was a doctor.

418
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,200
You can get that back...
all of it.

419
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:59,900
You need to believe that.

420
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:01,900
You believe that?

421
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,600
You think
you can get it all back?

422
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:11,400
I choose to have faith.

423
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:16,500
Because without
that, I'm nothing.

424
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:21,800
It's the only thing
that's keeping me going.

425
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:29,300
Well... I got two things
keeping me going.

426
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:33,000
First, is that I want
the people who killed my dad.

427
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,000
And actually,
the second...

428
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:43,100
ironically, I probably
wouldn't even say

429
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,700
if I hadn't lost him,
but, um...

430
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:48,300
You should know that...

431
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:56,800
Uh...

432
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:01,600
The first thing they tell you
when you take the job,

433
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:03,600
(clears throat)
is, um,

434
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,600
never to fall in love
with an inmate.

435
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:02,200
What's going on?

436
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:08,300
LINCOLN:
???

437
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:20,000
Linc. It's locked.

438
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:55,800
Hey! You can't be in here.

439
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,200
Run the roadblock.

440
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:07,300
Man, I can't do that.

441
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,500
Run it!

442
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:47,100
Bradley Bellick, FBI.

443
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:53,300
Brad Bellick, Federal Bureau
of Investigations.

444
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,200
Brad Bellick, FBI.

445
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:59,500
Special Agent
Brad Bellick, FBI.

446
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,800
Hi, there, I'm Brad Bellick
with the FBI.

447
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,500
I'm an agent with the FBI,
Brad Bellick.

448
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:09,700
Brad Bellick.
I'm with the Bureau.

449
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,600
Brad Bellick.
I'm with the Bureau.

450
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:18,300
I already talked to the cops,
told them all I had to say.

451
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,300
Yeah, well,
I'm no local hayseed cop.

452
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,400
I'm federal.

453
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,500
And you're not going to get away
with lying to me.

454
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,800
I didn't lie to nobody.

455
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:26,900
Really?

456
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,100
"He was just some homeless guy,
hangs around Hancock Square,

457
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,300
"hitting up college kids
for change.

458
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,500
"He's down there all the time.

459
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,500
if he's not there, I don't
know where to find him."

460
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
That's your statement, right?

461
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:38,200
Pretty much.

462
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:40,600
Right. See, the problem is
Charles "Haywire" Patoshik

463
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:43,600
is a paranoid,
who suffers from fear of crowds,

464
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:45,400
who's terrified
of strangers.

465
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:47,300
If he's anywhere,
he's in the middle of nowhere,

466
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,900
keeping to himself,
being a weirdo.

467
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,200
And?
And if you want to get tough...

468
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:53,100
how about I arrest
you right now

469
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,900
for hindering a
federal investigation?

470
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:56,200
Who they going to believe?

471
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:57,800
An agent with 15
years on the force

472
00:29:57,900 --> 00:30:00,500
and three Presidential
Citations

473
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:03,500
or a piece of white trash
with a juvie record?

474
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,100
I didn't ask him to do it,
but in case you haven't noticed,

475
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,100
I ain't exactly broken up

476
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,300
over my stepdad's death.

477
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:13,000
Why can't you just
leave this Patoshik guy alone?

478
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:14,200
Where is he?

479
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:18,000
Or do you want to get
locked up... right now?

480
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:26,700
Yeah.

481
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:28,300
I got a lead on Patoshik.

482
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:28,800
Where?

483
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:31,700
I'm on my way.

484
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:33,500
Keep him there.

485
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:35,100
Alone.

486
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,200
Any information
on Scofield and Burrows,

487
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:42,700
I want to be notified
immediately.

488
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,200
If that works out for you.

489
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:51,600
They're gonna have
cops waiting for us
at the next station.

490
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,100
We need to jump then.

491
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,100
And do what?

492
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:56,000
Hide under a barrel?

493
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,500
Linc's right.

494
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,300
Okay, you just
put those in there.

495
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:07,600
I'm so sorry
about all this.

496
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,700
It's okay, sweet pea.

497
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:16,800
Here's everything
right here, man.

498
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:23,400
It's good.

499
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:25,300
All right,
everyone in the storage room.

500
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,300
Now.

501
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,100
What?

502
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:30,900
Get back there until
the cops show up.

503
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:33,600
No, no, no, no,
I can't go back there.

504
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,100
Come on.
No.

505
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,000
Look, you kept a cool
head this whole time.

506
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,500
Don't get yourself killed now.

507
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:40,000
You know what?
Listen to me.

508
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,100
I'm a wanted man.

509
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,200
Okay?

510
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:46,900
If the police show up here,
they'll take me back to prison,

511
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:48,400
and you know what?
That's fine.

512
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:51,400
But my little girl right here?
She's sick.

513
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:53,200
And she's going
to be left alone.

514
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:56,900
And I can't let
that happen,

515
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:00,400
so can you please
let us go?

516
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:14,100
Go!

517
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:16,800
(whispers):
This way. Let's go.

518
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:20,300
All right, everyone in the back.

519
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,200
Move.

520
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:24,300
Not you.
No!

521
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,500
You're coming with me.

522
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,800
Go on. Move.

523
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:31,100
(whispers):
Okay, I want you to
stay right here, okay?

524
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:34,900
Go on!

525
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:35,700
Hey.

526
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:40,400
I think you should
let her go, man.

527
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,600
(cocks hammer)
Take off. Last chance.

528
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:43,900
You've got the money.

529
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,800
Burglary and assault.

530
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:48,100
Man, hey, that's change,
man, that's little time.

531
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:49,100
But this right here...

532
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,300
you will be in prison for the rest
of your life.

533
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,300
Believe me on that.
Unless you want

534
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,400
your daughter to see you die,

535
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:57,800
move.

536
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,500
(grunting, clattering)

537
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:04,800
I'm trying
to help you, man!

538
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:09,100
Come here!

539
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,500
Sweetie, stay right there.

540
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:23,700
Oh, no.

541
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:39,400
Who did this?

542
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,100
I did.

543
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:52,800
Is it good?

544
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,200
(whispers):
Thank you.

545
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:10,100
BELLICK:
Haywire!

546
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:12,200
Don't move!

547
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:16,000
Run! Larry! Run! Hurry!

548
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:16,800
Hurry!
(barking)

549
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:28,800
(over radio):
Dino, it's Eric.

550
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:30,700
We've got four jumpers.

551
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:32,000
<i>Three males and a female.</i>

552
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:33,100
 <i>Call it in </i>

553
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:34,400
and get us to the next station.

554
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:35,500
Do you hear me?

555
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,000
Get us to the next station.

556
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:42,600
The men who pushed through
the roadblock are jumping off

557
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:45,100
the train near mile marker 54,

558
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:46,800
JUST ???

559
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,500
Freeze!
Don't shoot!

560
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,400
Don't shoot!

561
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:33,600
Turn around!

562
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,400
I'm an employee
of the train company.

563
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:41,600
Dino, it's Eric.
We've got four jumpers.

564
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,600
Three males and a female.

565
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,000
Call it in
and get us to the next station.

566
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,800
Let's go. Come on.

567
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:49,300
They told us
to jump and run

568
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:51,500
and not to look back
or they'd shoot us.

569
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,100
We need to find a car.

570
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,000
(phone rings)
Yeah.

571
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,600
I got Haywire trapped.

572
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:46,800
Don't do anything.

573
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:48,700
Just hold him until I get there.

574
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:51,800
No problem.
I got this wingnut treed.

575
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,100
Caroline.

576
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:17,600
REYNOLDS:
Paul, where are you?

577
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,200
Did you send the police?

578
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:20,700
No, of course not.

579
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,200
How did they know
I was on that train?

580
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,600
Paul, I have no idea.

581
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:26,900
I'll let the president know.

582
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:29,000
I contact the president
directly.

583
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:32,300
Are Burrows and Scofield
with you?

584
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,200
I was expecting
to brief the president.

585
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:38,600
You report to me now.

586
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:40,500
Paul?

587
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:44,800
Where did we spend
my 35th birthday?

588
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:45,900
What?

589
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:48,000
The restaurant.

590
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:49,600
Where was it? You remember.

591
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:51,800
Don't be ridiculous.
I have to go.

592
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:52,800
Do not hang up.

593
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:53,900
I have to go.

594
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:55,600
Just get Burrows and Scofield...

595
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:56,300
Hey.

596
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:58,600
Whoever this is...

597
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,800
tell Bill Kim
that he just screwed up...

598
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:03,700
big-time.

599
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:08,200
Paul? Paul?

600
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:37,800
(chuckles):
What's all this?

601
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:40,600
Some whacko climbs up
to a grain elevator,

602
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:42,100
people want to watch.
(sirens approaching)

603
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,500
Oh, God, you were supposed
to keep a handle on things.

604
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:46,000
Do you know what
that means?

605
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:49,000
I got you Haywire.
What else do you want?

606
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,800
FBI. He's my chargee.

607
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:27,400
How you doing, Charles?

608
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,900
I don't want
to go back to prison.

609
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,400
I don't blame you.

610
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:36,200
I want to go to Holland.

611
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,000
(chuckles):
That's not what I
expected to hear.

612
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,800
But you can't
go there, son.

613
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,300
I just...

614
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,900
(crying):
I just want
to go... here.

615
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,300
See?

616
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:56,900
(whispers):
Yeah.

617
00:39:58,300 --> 00:39:59,400
I'll tell you what.

618
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:03,700
You don't have to go to prison.

619
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:08,300
But you can't go
to Holland, either.

620
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:11,100
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
It's okay,

621
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:12,500
it's okay, it's okay.

622
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:15,200
Hey, you're in a tough spot.

623
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,800
You feel trapped, you
got no options, and...

624
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:20,100
caught in a situation
where you have no control.

625
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:22,800
I know how you feel.

626
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:24,300
I do.

627
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:28,900
It takes its toll
on you, and all you
want to do is run.

628
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,100
But run where?

629
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,100
I just want to go.

630
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,200
There's a way out.

631
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:47,300
A way out?

632
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:48,800
Yeah.

633
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:52,200
Of this maze?

634
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:55,400
Yeah.

635
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:03,500
There are private humidors
in the back.

636
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:05,500
Each member's name
is on their box.

637
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:06,600
Any security?

638
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,500
A receptionist.
That's it.

639
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,300
I'm not a wanted fugitive.

640
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:13,300
Give me the key.
I'll do it.

641
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:18,600
Want to take a walk?

642
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:19,800
Yeah.

643
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,700
 <i>I know you killed your parents</i>

644
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:22,800
because they hurt you.

645
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:27,200
And I know you killed
that guy yesterday
because he was

646
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,000
hurting Sasha,
but what you did...

647
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,200
was wrong.

648
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,200
You know that.

649
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:38,000
(crying):
