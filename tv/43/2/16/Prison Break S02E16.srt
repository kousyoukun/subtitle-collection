00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,360
《越獄》前情回顧
Previously on Prison Break

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:05,000
-東西在哪?   -你去死
-Where is it?   -Go to hell.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,700
這是你自找的
You did this to yourself.

4
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:09,060
莎拉 如果你在聽的話
Sara, if you're listening, 

5
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:11,100
現在只希望你能找到安全的避難所
I only hope,by now, you've found your safe haven.

6
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:13,730
我利用了你 置你於一個
I took advantage of you, put you in a place

7
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:15,500
對每個醫生來說都是噩夢的境地
that's every doctor's nightmare.

8
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,260
莎拉·唐克雷蒂 你瞭解嗎?
Sara Tancredi. You know her well?

9
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:19,600
如果你能把我調到隔離監獄  我對她的瞭解會更深
I'd know her a lot better if you can get my ass moved.

10
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:20,560
我會跟獄長商量看
I'll talk to the warden.

11
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,130
"另一次機會"和"安全避難所"
"Another chance" and "safe haven." 

12
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:24,160
這都是出自一本有名的書
Those are the names of

13
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,030
這些詞都出自那"酗酒無名氏"的章節名
some of the chapters in the book they use an aa.

14
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:27,830
別亂來
Make no mistake about it.

15
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:31,800
我們死都要在一起
We will be a family if it kills us.

16
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,030
那就是你的地圖?
That's your map?

17
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:35,960
你的手腕怎麼了?
What happened to your arm?

18
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,200
我爸爸也是個酒鬼
My dad drinks, too.

19
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,130
我肚子痛
My tummy hurts.

20
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:44,400
她需要那藥 沒藥她走不了兩天
She needs that medicine. She can't go two days without it.

21
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,460
基斯的案子就要審判了
Kacee's going into the system now.

22
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:47,060
再加一條叛逃罪
Aiding an escaped con.

23
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:48,660
告訴她律師我會自首
Tell her lawyer I'll turn myself in.

24
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:49,900
基斯說你得趕緊跑
Kacee said you need to run.

25
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:51,100
如果你被抓了或自首了
If you get busted or turn yourself in,

26
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:53,030
迪迪就沒爹沒娘了
Dede won't have either of you.

27
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:54,830
邁克爾 我想讓這一切結束
Michael, I want for this to be over.

28
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:56,770
我們都想讓這結束
That makes two of us. 

29
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:57,860
但我們得看你父親到底給你留了什麼
It's just a question of looking at whatever it is your father gave you.

30
00:00:57,860 --> 00:00:59,860
就只有一個鑰匙
It's just a key.

31
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:02,900
必要的話 可以利用下總統...
If I may, sir, the president... she could be useful.

32
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:04,260
總統?
Madam president?

33
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:05,660
我想讓你回來 保羅
I want you to come home, Paul.

34
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:07,530
我們能搞定的
We can fix this,

35
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:09,830
我不要你帶這那兩兄弟到處亂來
but not with those brothers running around the country.

36
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:11,060
凱若琳...
Caroline...

37
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:12,960
把他們交給我 保羅
bring them in, Paul,

38
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,630
之後一切就可恢復原樣了
and everything can go back to the way it was.

39
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,930
保羅 克裡曼探員
Agent Kellerman.

40
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:44,330
保羅 你在哪?
Paul, where are you?

41
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:45,960
在個沒人管的地方 不記得了?
Out in the cold. Remember?

42
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:49,260
今晚我要在芝加哥發表演說
I'm speaking in Chicago tonight.

43
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:04,400
林肯
Lincoln.

44
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,960
莎拉
Sara.

45
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:09,530
真是有趣 當你需要我了才打電話給我
It's funny how you only call me when you need me.

46
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:10,900
也許有趣這個詞用的並不恰當
Maybe "funny" is not the right word.

47
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:13,100
這些都可解決的 保羅
All of this can go away, Paul.

48
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,860
是嗎?
Can it?

49
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:17,930
當然 我是美國總統
Yes.I'm the president of the united states.

50
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:19,900
回芝加哥來吧
Please just come back to Chicago

51
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:22,360
把布倫斯和斯科菲爾德交給我
and turn Burrows and Scofield in.

52
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:26,900
我答應你 我會讓一切恢復原樣
I promise you that I will make everything go back to the way it was.

53
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,300
我得掛了
I have to go.

54
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:31,230
回來吧 保羅
Just come back, Paul.

55
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:34,060
我需要你
I need you.

56
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,200
你認為我們手上握有籌碼?
You actually think we have a shot?

57
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:39,830
那得看你爸留給了你什麼
It depends on what your father gave you.

58
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:41,900
這是我找到他時從他口袋掉出來的
This fell out of his pocket when I found him.

59
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:45,930
我認不出這個標誌 你呢?
I don't recognize the insignia, do you?

60
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:48,560
不認識
No.

61
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,660
但是 呃...
But, uh...

62
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:57,160
莎拉 我們現在有個合夥人
Sara, we've got someone working with us now.

63
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:10,860
早上好啊 陽光燦爛的早晨
good morning, sunshine.

64
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,700
睡的如何?
How did you sleep?

65
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,860
讓我來告訴你
I'll tell you what.

66
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:25,760
我會讓孩子們出來 然後給大家弄早飯
I'll go unlock the kids and make us all breakfast.

67
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,730
不 我去給孩子們開門
No. I'll get the kids.

68
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:28,900
-不...    -噓 我去
-No...    -tu-tut-tut. I insist.

69
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:32,730
不
No.

70
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:51,560
我去把孩子們叫來
I'll get the kids.

71
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:57,360
塗些潤膚霜會讓瘀傷好一點
Some hand cream will make them rope burns feel better.

72
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,330
沒用的
It won't work.

73
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:00,630
當然有用了
'Course it will. 

74
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:02,730
看這上面寫的 緩解皮膚傷痛和...
Says right here on the bottle: "Soothes skin irritations and..."

75
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:05,230
不 這個
No. This.

76
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:06,700
這沒用的 我得去工作
It won't work.I've got a job.

77
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,460
孩子們得上學
The kids have school.

78
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:11,300
在這段小小的適應期過後
We're all going to get back to our normal routines

79
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:14,300
一切都會回復正常的
once this little adjustment period is over.

80
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,730
今天有人會過來
There's someone coming over today.

81
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:16,560
誰?
Who?

82
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,530
一個女的 帕蒂
This woman, Patty,

83
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:19,030
歡樂購協會的人
from the welcome wagon committee.

84
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:20,230
打電話給她取消
Call her and cancel.

85
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:22,130
我沒她的電話
I don't have her number.

86
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:24,400
如果她來了 我又不去開門
And,if she shows up,and I don't answer the door,

87
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,760
她會發覺有點不對勁的
she's going to know something's wrong.

88
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:35,130
泰迪...
Teddy...

89
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:38,630
泰迪熊...
Teddy bear...

90
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:41,130
你得走了
you need to go.

91
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:45,660
如果她認出你的話...
If she recognizes you...

92
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:51,300
我不想你惹麻煩上身
I don't want you to get in trouble.

93
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:59,060
胡說
That's nonsense.

94
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:03,160
沒什麼麻煩
It's no trouble.

95
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:09,330
什麼麻煩都不會有
No trouble at all.

96
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,430
嗨 莎拉
Hi, Sara.

97
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:19,830
過去的就讓他過去吧
What's done is done.

98
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:22,830
我們目標一致啊
We all want the same thing.

99
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,760
你沒告訴我們你想讓她死
You didn't tell us you left her to die.

100
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:30,360
我只是嚇嚇她
I was scaring her.And I could pull her out.

101
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:34,360
不 不 你想淹死我
No. No, you left me in there to drown.

102
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,630
我倒想看看你能屏住呼吸多久
I wonder how long you can hold your breath.

103
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:37,430
我們來試試看
Maybe we should find out.

104
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:40,530
你們需要我 你們知道的
You need me, and you know it.

105
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:43,330
你們需要我 你們需要我 你知道的
You need me. You need me, and you know it.

106
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,900
為什麼? 我們為何需要他? 鑰匙在我們手上
Why? Why do we need him?We have the key. 

107
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,000
我們會找出究竟是什麼東西
We'll find out what it's for.

108
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,430
我現在就可以告訴你們是什麼東西
I can tell you what that key's for right now.

109
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:56,630
這是一個私人雪茄俱樂部的鑰匙
It's to a private cigar club.

110
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:58,500
哪?
Where?

111
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,690
芝加哥
Chicago.

112
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:41,530
我們得快點了
We have to hurry.

113
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:42,830
我們得快點 拉瑞
We have to hurry, Larry. 

114
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:45,530
我做了壞事
I did a bad thing.

115
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:49,760
天哪!我做了件很不好的事
God! I did a very bad thing.

116
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:57,100
80 30 77公路上的所有加油站 
All gas stations On 80, 30, 77.

117
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:00,930
我要斯科菲爾德和布倫斯的照片貼滿每一個加油站
I want Scofield's and Burrows' pictures on each and every gas pump.

118
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:03,830
-沒油他們哪都去不             -長官?
-If they have no fuel,they can't get anywhere.  -Sir?

119
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:05,600
-什麼事?  -我們或許得把我們的注意力
-What?    -We might need to divert our attention away

120
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,300
從斯科菲爾德和布倫斯身上轉移開一會兒了
from Scofield and Burrows for a while.

121
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,560
為什麼我得那樣做
Why would I do that?

122
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:12,560
因為另外一個逃犯剛剛殺了一個公民
Because one of the other escapees just killed a civilian.

123
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:15,630
一個符合這樣描述的人
A man fitting his description was spotted

124
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:18,700
滿身血跡地從殘忍的殺人現場逃脫
running from the scene of a brutal homicide.

125
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,700
就發生在埃爾戈馬 威斯康辛
Happened in Algoma, Wisconsin,

126
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:23,100
從監獄裡逃出來不到四小時
less than four hours from the prison.

127
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,860
給麥迪遜辦公室打電話
Call the field office in Madison,

128
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:26,430
讓他們立刻找一些特工去那兒
and have them get some agents out there right away.

129
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:27,560
我馬上報告總局
Okay.I'll notify headquarters.

130
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,130
我沒有說總局
I didn't say headquarters.

131
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:31,100
我說 難道你不服從指揮
I said, are you not following direct orders?

132
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:34,660
我服從 長官
Oh, I am following direct orders, sir.

133
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:37,760
只不過現在不再服從你了
Just not from you anymore.

134
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:41,860
從現在開始所有事件都要聽從總部
Everything goes through headquarters from now on.

135
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:45,030
可以嗎
may I?

136
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,030
恩
yeah.

137
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:57,230
你聽說帕托塞克的事了
You heard about Patoshik.

138
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:58,530
就在剛剛
Just now.

139
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:00,730
很好
Good.

140
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,430
他跑了
He goes.

141
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:03,730
他是個精神病
Come on, the man is mentally ill.

142
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:05,230
他什麼都不知道 他並不是個威脅
He doesn't know anything, he's not a threat...

143
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:08,030
帕托塞克當過一陣子斯科菲爾德的同房囚犯
Patoshik was one of Scofield's cellmates for awhile.

144
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:09,630
斯科菲爾德把他列在逃跑計劃中
Scofield included him in the escape.

145
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:10,700
誰知道他知道些什麼
Who knows what he knows?

146
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,030
可斯科菲爾德和布倫斯還在逃
Scofield and Burrows are still out there.

147
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:14,660
現在不用擔心斯科菲爾德和布倫斯
Don't worry about Scofield and Burrows right now.

148
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:18,560
好 再一次
So, again...

149
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,800
帕托塞克
Patoshik goes.

150
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,800
小心點
Take care of it.

151
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,500
你負責這節車廂的座位?
Hi, are you in charge of seating?

152
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,760
有什麼我能幫您
Yeah, can I help you?

153
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:32,360
保羅克裡曼探員  特工部門
Agent Paul Kellerman, Secret Service.

154
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,830
我要把一個逃犯運到芝加哥
I'm transporting a fugitive to Chicago.

155
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:35,660
我需要你給我一節空的車廂
I need you to clear a car for me.

156
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:37,500
- 一個逃犯?      - 哦 是的
- A fugitive?    - Yes,that's right.

157
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,560
只是
Well, 

158
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,230
我們的車廂快坐滿了
it's just that we're already near capacity...

159
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:42,600
你希望他碰到你的其他乘客?
you want him to rub elbows with your other passengers?

160
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,960
-不 長官    -好吧
-No, sir.   -Okay.

161
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,460
他以什麼罪名被通緝
What's he wanted for?

162
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:47,160
殺人
Killing people.

163
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,360
天哪
Good lord. Make it happen.

164
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,500
那確實發生了
Make it happen.

165
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,630
好吧 來吧 跟著我
All right, come on, follow me.

166
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:06,660
一切都會沒事的
It's gonna be all right.

167
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:10,460
如果你這麼認為的話
If you say so.

168
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,430
利用他幫我們得到我們需要的
We use him to get what we need,

169
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:16,930
然後就甩掉他
then we dump him.

170
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:19,900
好的
Okay.

171
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:27,900
我很抱歉你被捲到這件事裡
I'm sorry you got involved in this.

172
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,300
事實上你對我們的幫助
The fact that you're helping us...

173
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:33,300
意義重大
means a lot.

174
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:36,700
謝謝
Thank you.

175
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:43,560
其他的乘客不會遇到危險吧?
The other riders aren't in any danger, are they?

176
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,660
我的意思是 我們是不是應該發佈個公告什麼的
I mean, should I make an announcement or anything?

177
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,860
你希望這裡變得一片混亂?
You want pandemonium?

178
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:51,030
-不 長官   -好 不發佈公告
-No,sir.  -Okay,then no announcements,right?

179
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,600
只要讓所有人遠離這節車廂就行了
Just keep everybody out of this car

180
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,660
那就萬事大吉了
then everything is jake.

181
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:54,900
我做這事兒都幾百萬次了
I've done this a million times.

182
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,030
從沒發生過什麼事
Never had a problem.

183
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:59,330
好的 我照辦
Okay, will do.

184
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:12,600
好了 我們走
Let's go.

185
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,630
我們大概要花五個小時到芝加哥
We'll be in Chicago in about five hours.

186
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:25,760
想要休息會兒嗎?
Want to get some rest.

187
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:44,630
你還好嗎?
You okay?

188
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:47,760
恩
Yeah.

189
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:02,930
光頭
Brad. 

190
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:05,060
你看上去不是很好
You don't look too good.

191
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:06,230
我幫你搞定了莎拉·唐克雷蒂的事
I helped you with Sara Tancredi,

192
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:08,000
你應該把我弄到隔離監獄去
and you were supposed to get me into AD Seg.

193
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,500
我試過了
I tried.

194
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:15,630
但是你的新監獄長...
But your new warden... Mm...

195
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:17,030
是一個道德上循規蹈矩的人
straight as an arrow.

196
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:21,760
但是我可以幫你弄到 一個比隔離監獄更好的地方
But I might be able to do you one better than AD Seg.

197
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:26,030
你通過俄羅斯女孩 發現了斯科菲爾德和布倫斯是嗎?
You found Scofield and Burrows through the Russian girl,right?

198
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:28,330
是的 尼卡 怎麼了
Yeah, Nika. Why?

199
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:32,930
你還通過追蹤蘇珊 霍蘭德 來追捕巴格威爾
And you tracked down Bagwell by following Susan Hollander.

200
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:35,630

左手擦我的屁股
and I wipe my ass with my left.

202
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:40,160
怎麼了
What of it?

203
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,930
我有個很有權勢的後台
I've got very powerful people behind me

204
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:49,930
他希望我趕快結束這項工作
that want me to finish my job.

205
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:51,700
只要他們說一句話
They can push through the quickest habeas

206
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:54,760
法院就能以前所未見的速度
corpus proceedings the courts have ever seen.

207
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:58,160
通過人身保護權行動程序
Paperwork's sitting on the right

208
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,060
然後就能保釋外出
person's desk as we speak,

209
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:04,230
你違法憲法的控訴
setting forth all the constitutional violations in your prosecution.

210
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:07,630
你就等著消除得一乾二淨
It's just waiting to be rubber-stamped.

211
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:11,460
那我需要做什麼?
And what do I have to do?

212
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:15,030
你只需要找到那些逃犯
You just find those cons.

213
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:16,860
只是這次
Only, this time...

214
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:18,560
你是幫我做這個
you're gonna do it for me--

215
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:23,960
非公認的 沒有正式公文
unofficially,under the radar,no paper trail...

216
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:27,600
我需要一隻專門處理垃圾的狗去做那些髒事
I need a junkyard dog who's willing to do

217
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:32,060
將那些犯人繩之以法
the ugly things it takes to bring a con to justice.

218
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,700
你願意成為我的走狗 光頭?
Are you my dog, Brad?

219
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:43,900
他媽的 好吧 我同意
Damn hell, yeah, I am.

220
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:47,230
這真好吃
This is delicious. 

221
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:49,100
你把它叫什麼?
What'd you call it again?

222
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,500
那個 我最愛的派對蛋糕
That, my dear Patty-cake, 

223
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:53,660
我阿姨回巴馬時曾經叫它"流浪雞"

一份雞肉 兩份辣椒 三份真實的流浪生活
One part chicken,two parts spice,three part actual hobo.

225
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:05,130
我知道...家禽

227
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,700
但我發現缺少肉類
but I have found a lean meat can

228
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:15,400
就像缺少開胃酒...
act as an aperitif to, uh...

229
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:19,560
會讓餐盤失去了...
awaken the pallet 

230
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:22,030
食物的香味以及鬆軟可口
for more subtle flavors and textures, 

231
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:24,460
就像...

00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:45,400
我和其他那些受切斷手術的人 一起參加志願活動

These three guys said they saw

279
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:08,450
你們快要打起來了
what looked to be a fight going on in there.

280
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:10,710
你看 我們很好 只要讓火車快點到芝加哥就行了
They didn't,all right? Just get the train to Chicago.

281
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:11,950
需要我去叫警察來嗎?
Do I need to notify the police?

282
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:13,550
你只要做好我剛才叫你做的事就行了
You need to do what I just told you to do.

283
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:15,380
你收你的票我 我來看好這群亡命之徒
You take the tickets, I'll watch the fugitive.

284
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:17,150
你們在外面想怎麼吵 
You guys can just continue to do bong hits,

285
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:18,480
或者你們在那想怎麼鬧就怎麼鬧?
or whatever you do back there, okay?

286
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,010
管好你們自己的事情 知道了嗎?
Now would you guys mind your own business?

287
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:22,180
都聽清楚了嗎?
Everybody clear?

288
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:24,510
非常好
Great.

289
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:26,910
別再進來打攪我們了
Don't interrupt again, please.

290
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:32,780
我想我們都應該清楚
Just so we're all clear:

291
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:33,980
如果她還想殺死我的話
If she tries that again...

292
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:35,450
你要幹什麼?
you'll do what?

293
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:38,080
你先在那排座位上待著吧
Just stay on the other side of the car.

294
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:42,250
保羅 這不是個人恩怨
It wasn't personal, Paul.

295
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:36,480
這是什麼?
What're these?

296
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,850
我...
Oh, I'm, uh...

297
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:39,510
做了些整修
gonna do some renovations.

298
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:43,780
我剛才在釘這個石膏板 還差一個螺釘
Uh, I was just tappin' the sheetrock,lookin' for the stud.

299
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:45,380
似乎你已經找到了
Looks like you already found one.

300
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:48,850
好大一張嘴
Potty mouth!

301
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:54,250
我和那些女孩每週五都會在書吧聚會
Me and the girls get together every friday for book club.

302
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:57,280
你應該來主持這周的聚會 這樣大家都可以認識你了
You ought to host it this week and everybody can meet you.

303
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,580
而且我也可以再次看到你
I'll see you then!

304
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:01,450
我都等不及了
Can't wait.

305
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:07,950
不能再在這裡待了
this ain't ever gonna work here.

306
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:12,150
去收拾你們的東西 我們準備要搬家
Go pack your things, we're movin'

307
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:39,950
如果你繼續不理我的話
If you don't stop me,

308
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:43,950
我就把這些好吃的都吃掉
I'm gonna eat this whole thing by myself.

309
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:50,750
好吧 寶貝 聽我說
All right, sweetie,listen.

310
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:53,810
我和你打個商量怎麼樣
I'll make a deal with you.

311
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:56,580
還記得我們今天看到的那個旋轉木馬嗎?
Remember that merry-go-round that we saw today?

312
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:59,550
如果你不把這些東西吃了的話
You're not gonna get a chance to ride it,

313
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:02,010
你就沒有機會去玩了  快吃吧
if you don't eat something. Go ahead.

314
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:05,210
我有點不舒服
I don't feel good.

315
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:14,110
哦 寶貝
Oh, sweetie.

316
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:17,580
好了 振作點
Okay, come on.

317
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:20,350
我們走吧 好嗎?
Let's go, all right?

318
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:23,750
我抱你
I got you.

319
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:26,450
好了 稍微等下 是要甜豆嗎?
Okay, just hold on. Okay, sweet pea?

320
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:27,980
結帳
Check, please?

321
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:31,850
聽著! 所有人都不准動!
All right! Nobody move!

322
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,280
莎拉 在嗎?
Hey, Sara?

323
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:44,280
我想一個人待會
Not now

324
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,180
她怎麼樣了?
how is she?

325
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:06,110
她想一個人靜靜
Well, she wants to be alone.

326
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:09,650
我們用鑰匙拿到她父親藏的東西後
So we get what her dad locked away with that key.

327
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:11,680
接下來我們怎麼辦?
What do we do then?

328
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:14,310
我是說... 你也看到了他們是如何分析那個錄像帶
I mean... you saw what they did with the tape we made.

329
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:16,110
他們會把我們揭露出來的事情都處理好的
They're gonna bury everything we put out there.

330
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:18,110
這就是我們為什麼把他留在身邊的原因
That's why we're keeping him close to us.

331
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:20,950
他在華盛頓有很多的關係
He's got a lot of connections in washington.

332
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:25,350
如果我們去雪茄俱樂部 打開她父親的箱子
So we get to the cigar club,open her dad's box...

333
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:28,810
卻只是找到了一大堆的雪茄 怎麼辦?
what if the only thing inside's a bunch of stogies?

334
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:31,950
我覺得它值得我們去弄個明白
I think it's worth making the trip to find out.

335
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,210
你好?
Yes?

336
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:49,710
凱若琳
Caroline.

337
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:52,750
保羅 你在哪兒?
Paul. Where are you?

338
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:54,580
我想知道你確切的意思
I need to know exactly what you meant

339
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:56,710
你說會把事情處理好
when you said you were gonna make this right.

340
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:58,010
我要聽具體點的
I need specifics.

341
00:21:58,010 --> 00:22:00,110
你在哪兒? 你周圍的是什麼聲音?
Where are you? What's that noise?

342
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:02,650
我在火車上 一會就到芝加哥了
I'm on a train. I'll be in Chicago later today.

343
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:04,350
我要知道具體點的東西
But I need to know specifics.

344
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:06,310
布倫斯和斯科菲爾德在哪?
Where are Burrows and Scofield?

345
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:07,510
他們和你在一起嗎?
Are they with you?

346
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:10,280
不用那麼擔心他們 關心關心我吧
Don't worry about them,worry about me.

347
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:13,150
保羅 在我的部門裡還有很多職位的空缺
Paul,there are still positions in my administration 

348
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:15,450
無論是主管還是職員都需要人
that need to be filled--including chief of staff.

349
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:17,850
我希望你會參與進來
I want that to be you.

350
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:20,280
當我到了芝加哥 我會去見你
When I get to Chicago, we'll meet.

351
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:23,510
到時候再談
We'll talk.

352
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:33,110
把全部都拿出來
all of it.

353
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:34,380
夥計 我就帶了買三明治的錢
Man, I just brought enough to get a sandwich.

354
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:37,610
當時我就坐在那兒  真的
I was sitting right there, okay?

355
00:22:37,610 --> 00:22:38,950
如果你說謊...
If you're lying...

356
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:41,350
你看我女兒生病了
look, my daughter is sick,

357
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:44,550
我不想在這裡浪費太多時間
and I don't want to spend any more minutes in here than necessary.

358
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:48,750
相信我 這是我所有的東西了
Trust me, that is all that I have.

359
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:56,610
寶貝 你有什麼東西嗎?
What do you got, sweetheart?

360
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:02,580
你有什麼東西?
What do you got?

361
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:07,880
你敢不聽話?!
You don't want to listen?!

362
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,210
嘿 嘿 冷靜點 夥計
Hey, hey, calm down, man.

363
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:10,350
閉嘴!
Shut up!

364
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:11,410
好吧
All right.

365
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:13,450
聽我說 你要冷靜點
Listen to me, you've got to calm down.

366
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:16,380
好吧 我幫你拿你想要的東西
All right, I can help you get everything that you want.

367
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:19,850
你也不想傷害任何人 對吧?
But you don't want to hurt anybody else, right?

368
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:21,750
來吧
Come on.

369
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:24,310
聽我說
Look, listen.

370
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:25,980
你先去前面把門鎖上好嗎?
Why don't you go ahead and lock the door,

371
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,410
然後把"停止營業"的牌子掛上
and turn the closed sign back,

372
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:30,650
那別人就會覺得這裡已經關門了 是吧?
so everybody thinks that this place is closed, all right?

373
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:33,050
然後讓大家都離窗戶遠點兒
And then, we can get everybody away from the window

374
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:34,350
這樣做你能放心點了嗎?
Is that cool with you?

375
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:36,010
大家都離窗戶遠點 好嗎?
Everybody's away from the window, okay?

376
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:38,580
大家快行動起來都到那邊去
Let's move everybody onto this side of the room.

377
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:40,050
去那邊 大家快
Get on this side of the room, everybody.

378
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:41,910
到那邊去 離窗戶遠點
Let's move to this side of the room from the window.

379
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:44,080
快!大家都到那邊去好嗎?
Move!Everybody,let's get on this side of the room, okay?

380
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,150
去那邊
This side of the room.

381
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:47,050
把我女兒也帶過去 好嗎?
Why don't you take my daughter, okay?

382
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:48,350
把她帶到那邊去
Take her on this side of the room, so that everybody...

383
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:50,910
所有人都會沒事的
everything is gonna be okay.

384
00:23:50,910 --> 00:23:52,550
一切都會好的
Everything is gonna be fine.

385
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:54,610
現在你不用對任何人開槍了 是吧?
Because you're not gonna put your hand on another person, right?

386
00:23:54,610 --> 00:23:56,550
對吧?
Right.

387
00:23:56,550 --> 00:23:57,850
沒錯 我們做的不錯
We're all good.

388
00:23:57,850 --> 00:24:00,280
是的
Yeah

389
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,850
我們做的很好?
all good?

390
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:04,450
我們做的很好 是吧?
We're good, right?

391
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,680
嘿 莎拉?
Hey, Sara?

392
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,980
進來吧
Come on in.

393
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:20,980
嘿
hey

394
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:34,150
我一直坐在這裡想
I've been sitting here evaluating.

395
00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:38,280
我...
I, uh...

396
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,950
我在保釋中逃走
I jumped bail.

397
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:42,380
並被通緝
I'm on the run,

398
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:46,650
而且我剛剛還想殺死一個人
and I just tried to take a man's life.

399
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:50,450
我真沒用
I'm not using.

400
00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:57,150
而這些就是我的所做所為
Which is actually quite an accomplishment.

401
00:24:58,050 --> 00:25:00,450
但是在三個星期前 我還是個醫生
But three weeks ago, I was a doctor.

402
00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:05,680
你可以把失去的東西都拿回來
You can get that back...all of it.

403
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:07,880
你要堅定信心
You need to believe that.

404
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:12,580
你真的那麼認為嗎?
You believe that?

405
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:16,650
你能把失去的東西都找回來嗎?
You think you can get it all back?

406
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:22,580
我選擇去相信
I choose to have faith.

407
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:27,080
如果我不相信 我就完了
Because without that, I'm nothing.

408
00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:31,750
這是唯一支持我做下去的動力
It's the only thing that's keeping me going.

409
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:38,880
是啊...有兩件事讓我一直堅持到現在
I got two things keeping me going.

410
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:43,780
第一是我要找到殺害我父親的兇手
First, is that I want the people who killed my dad.

411
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:47,510
然後第二件就是...
And actually, the second...

412
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:51,510
真諷刺 也許我不應該說是誰害死了他
ironically, I probably wouldn't even say 

413
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:55,450
如果我沒有失去他的話 而且...
if I hadn't lost him, but, um...

414
00:25:55,450 --> 00:25:58,380
你知道...
you should know that...

415
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:06,150
