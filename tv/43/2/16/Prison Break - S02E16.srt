1
00:00:00,843 --> 00:00:02,709
Where is it? Go to hell.

2
00:00:02,776 --> 00:00:05,477
You did this to yourself.

3
00:00:05,542 --> 00:00:06,876
Sara, if you're listening,

4
00:00:06,943 --> 00:00:08,843
I only hope, by now, you've
found your safe haven.

5
00:00:08,909 --> 00:00:11,477
I took advantage of
you, put you in a place

6
00:00:11,542 --> 00:00:13,210
That's every doctor's nightmare.

7
00:00:13,276 --> 00:00:15,043
Sara Tancredi. You know her well?

8
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:17,276
I'd know her a lot better
if you can get my ass moved.

9
00:00:17,343 --> 00:00:18,276
I'll talk to the warden.

10
00:00:18,343 --> 00:00:19,876
"Another Chance" and "Safe Haven."

11
00:00:19,943 --> 00:00:21,843
Those are the names
of some of the chapters

12
00:00:21,909 --> 00:00:23,709
In the book they use an AA.

13
00:00:23,776 --> 00:00:25,542
Make no mistake about it.

14
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:29,509
We will be a family if it kills us.

15
00:00:29,576 --> 00:00:31,709
That's your map? Mm-Hmm.

16
00:00:31,776 --> 00:00:33,642
What happened to your arm?

17
00:00:33,709 --> 00:00:34,843
My dad drinks, too.

18
00:00:36,943 --> 00:00:38,909
My tummy hurts.

19
00:00:38,976 --> 00:00:40,843
She needs that medicine. She can't go

20
00:00:40,909 --> 00:00:42,310
Two days without it.

21
00:00:42,377 --> 00:00:43,176
<i>Kacee's going into the system now.</i>

22
00:00:43,243 --> 00:00:44,843
<i>Aiding an escaped con.</i>

23
00:00:44,909 --> 00:00:46,377
Tell her lawyer I'll turn myself in.

24
00:00:46,443 --> 00:00:47,676
Kacee said you need to run.

25
00:00:47,743 --> 00:00:48,876
If you get busted or turn yourself in,

26
00:00:48,943 --> 00:00:50,743
<i>Dede won't have either of you.</i>

27
00:00:50,809 --> 00:00:52,509
Michael, I want for this to be over.

28
00:00:52,576 --> 00:00:53,509
That makes two of us.

29
00:00:53,576 --> 00:00:54,843
It's just a question

30
00:00:54,909 --> 00:00:55,542
Of looking at whatever it
is your father gave you.

31
00:00:55,609 --> 00:00:57,509
It's just a key.

32
00:00:57,576 --> 00:00:59,509
If I may, sir, the president...

33
00:00:59,576 --> 00:01:00,542
<i>She could be useful.</i>

34
00:01:00,609 --> 00:01:02,010
Madam President?

35
00:01:02,076 --> 00:01:03,310
I want you to come home, Paul.

36
00:01:03,377 --> 00:01:05,343
We can fix this,

37
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:07,542
<i>But not with those brothers
running around the country.</i>

38
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:08,876
Caroline...

39
00:01:08,943 --> 00:01:10,676
<i>Bring them in, Paul, and everything</i>

40
00:01:10,743 --> 00:01:12,276
Can go back to the way it was.

41
00:01:37,909 --> 00:01:39,676
Agent Kellerman.

42
00:01:39,743 --> 00:01:42,110
Paul, where are you?

43
00:01:42,176 --> 00:01:43,676
Out in the cold. Remember?

44
00:01:43,743 --> 00:01:45,876
I'm speaking in Chicago tonight.

45
00:01:59,576 --> 00:02:01,043
Lincoln.

46
00:02:02,143 --> 00:02:03,709
Sara.

47
00:02:03,776 --> 00:02:05,876
It's funny how you only call me

48
00:02:05,943 --> 00:02:07,276
When you need me.

49
00:02:07,343 --> 00:02:08,576
Maybe "funny" is not the right word.

50
00:02:08,642 --> 00:02:10,743
All of this can go away, Paul.

51
00:02:10,809 --> 00:02:12,642
Can it?

52
00:02:12,709 --> 00:02:15,609
Yes. I'm the President
of the United States.

53
00:02:15,676 --> 00:02:17,609
Please just come back to Chicago

54
00:02:17,676 --> 00:02:20,143
And turn Burrows and Scofield in.

55
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:22,477
I promise you that I will
make everything go back

56
00:02:22,542 --> 00:02:24,676
To the way it was.

57
00:02:24,743 --> 00:02:26,010
I have to go.

58
00:02:26,076 --> 00:02:28,909
Just come back, Paul.

59
00:02:28,976 --> 00:02:30,676
I need you.

60
00:02:32,709 --> 00:02:33,943
You actually think we have a shot?

61
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:37,509
It depends on what your father gave you.

62
00:02:37,576 --> 00:02:39,609
This fell out of his
pocket when I found him.

63
00:02:39,676 --> 00:02:43,576
I don't recognize the insignia, do you?

64
00:02:43,642 --> 00:02:46,243
No.

65
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:47,243
But, uh...

66
00:02:49,743 --> 00:02:53,809
Sara, we've got someone
working with us now.

67
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:07,443
Good morning, sunshine.

68
00:03:11,509 --> 00:03:13,310
How did you sleep?

69
00:03:18,443 --> 00:03:20,609
I'll tell you what.

70
00:03:20,676 --> 00:03:23,509
I'll go unlock the kids
and make us all breakfast.

71
00:03:23,576 --> 00:03:24,477
No. I'll get the kids.

72
00:03:24,542 --> 00:03:26,576
No... Tu-Tut-Tut.
I insist.

73
00:03:26,642 --> 00:03:29,377
No.

74
00:03:45,743 --> 00:03:48,176
<i>I'll get the kids.</i>

75
00:03:51,609 --> 00:03:55,110
Some hand cream will make
them rope burns feel better.

76
00:03:55,176 --> 00:03:57,043
It won't work.

77
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:58,410
'Course it will.

78
00:03:58,477 --> 00:04:00,509
Says right here on the
bottle: "Soothes skin

79
00:04:00,576 --> 00:04:03,010
Irritations and..." No. This.

80
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,377
It won't work. I've got a job.

81
00:04:04,443 --> 00:04:06,276
The kids have school.

82
00:04:06,343 --> 00:04:07,542
We're all going to get back

83
00:04:07,609 --> 00:04:09,010
To our normal routines

84
00:04:09,076 --> 00:04:12,043
Once this little
adjustment period is over.

85
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:13,377
There's someone coming over today.

86
00:04:13,443 --> 00:04:14,243
Who?

87
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:15,276
This woman, Patty,

88
00:04:15,343 --> 00:04:16,709
From the Welcome Wagon Committee.

89
00:04:16,776 --> 00:04:17,909
Call her and cancel.

90
00:04:17,976 --> 00:04:19,909
I don't have her number.

91
00:04:19,976 --> 00:04:22,210
And, if she shows up, and
I don't answer the door,

92
00:04:22,276 --> 00:04:24,377
She's going to know something's wrong.

93
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:31,776
Teddy...

94
00:04:34,809 --> 00:04:36,310
Teddy Bear...

95
00:04:36,377 --> 00:04:38,809
You need to go.

96
00:04:38,876 --> 00:04:42,276
If she recognizes you...

97
00:04:44,776 --> 00:04:47,909
I don't want you to get in trouble.

98
00:04:54,642 --> 00:04:56,743
That's nonsense.

99
00:04:56,809 --> 00:04:59,776
It's no trouble.

100
00:05:03,642 --> 00:05:05,976
No trouble at all.

101
00:05:14,909 --> 00:05:16,110
Hi, Sara.

102
00:05:16,176 --> 00:05:17,509
What's done is done.

103
00:05:17,576 --> 00:05:19,443
We all want the same thing.

104
00:05:22,542 --> 00:05:24,509
You didn't tell us you left her to die.

105
00:05:24,576 --> 00:05:26,976
I was scaring her.

106
00:05:29,343 --> 00:05:32,110
No. No, you left me in there to drown.

107
00:05:32,176 --> 00:05:33,310
I wonder how long you
can hold your breath.

108
00:05:33,377 --> 00:05:35,143
Maybe we should find out.

109
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:37,176
You need me, and you know it.

110
00:05:38,576 --> 00:05:39,976
You need me. You need me. You need me.

111
00:05:42,776 --> 00:05:44,542
Why? Why do we need
him? We have the key.

112
00:05:44,609 --> 00:05:46,743
We'll find out what
it's for. You're right.

113
00:05:46,809 --> 00:05:49,043
I can tell you what
that key's for right now.

114
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:54,276
It's to a private cigar club.

115
00:05:54,343 --> 00:05:56,143
Where?

116
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:59,243
Chicago.

117
00:06:32,925 --> 00:06:36,258
We have to hurry.

118
00:06:36,325 --> 00:06:37,592
We have to hurry, Larry.

119
00:06:37,658 --> 00:06:39,225
I did a bad thing.

120
00:06:40,725 --> 00:06:43,458
God! I did a very bad thing.

121
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:51,991
All gas stations: on 80, 30, 77.

122
00:06:52,058 --> 00:06:53,959
I want Scofield's and Burrows' pictures

123
00:06:54,024 --> 00:06:55,825
On each and every gas pump.

124
00:06:55,892 --> 00:06:58,758
If they have no fuel, they
can't get anywhere. Sir?

125
00:06:58,825 --> 00:07:00,492
What? We might need to divert

126
00:07:00,558 --> 00:07:03,058
Our attention away from
Scofield and Burrows for a while.

127
00:07:03,124 --> 00:07:04,358
Why would I do that?

128
00:07:04,425 --> 00:07:06,291
Because one of the other
escapees just killed a civilian.

129
00:07:07,558 --> 00:07:10,458
A man fitting his description

130
00:07:10,525 --> 00:07:13,525
Wasspotted running from the
scene of a brutal homicide.

131
00:07:13,592 --> 00:07:15,458
Happened in Algoma, Wisconsin,

132
00:07:15,525 --> 00:07:17,859
Less than four hours from the prison.

133
00:07:17,925 --> 00:07:19,625
Call the field office in Madison,

134
00:07:19,692 --> 00:07:21,291
And have them get some
agents out there right away.

135
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:22,358
Okay. I'll notify headquarters.

136
00:07:22,425 --> 00:07:23,892
I didn't say headquarters.

137
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:25,925
I said, are you not
following direct orders?

138
00:07:25,991 --> 00:07:29,458
Oh, I am following direct orders, sir.

139
00:07:29,525 --> 00:07:32,625
Just not from you anymore.

140
00:07:32,692 --> 00:07:35,658
Everything goes through
headquarters from now on.

141
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:38,725
May I?

142
00:07:48,792 --> 00:07:49,792
Yeah.

143
00:07:49,859 --> 00:07:51,991
You heard about Patoshik.

144
00:07:52,058 --> 00:07:53,291
Just now.

145
00:07:53,358 --> 00:07:55,458
Good.

146
00:07:55,525 --> 00:07:57,191
He goes.

147
00:07:57,258 --> 00:07:58,625
Come on, the man is mentally ill.

148
00:07:58,692 --> 00:08:00,091
He doesn't know anything,
he's not a threat...

149
00:08:00,158 --> 00:08:02,892
Patoshik was one of Scofield's
cellmates for awhile.

150
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:04,391
Scofield included him in the escape.

151
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:05,558
Who knows what he knows?

152
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:06,925
Scofield and Burrows
are still out there.

153
00:08:06,991 --> 00:08:08,391
Don't worry about Scofield
and Burrows right now.

154
00:08:10,124 --> 00:08:13,358
So, again...

155
00:08:13,425 --> 00:08:15,525
Patoshik goes.

156
00:08:15,592 --> 00:08:18,492
Take care of it.

157
00:08:21,391 --> 00:08:23,258
Hi, are you in charge of seating?

158
00:08:23,325 --> 00:08:24,592
Yeah, can I help you?

159
00:08:24,658 --> 00:08:27,258
Agent Paul Kellerman, Secret Service.

160
00:08:27,325 --> 00:08:28,658
I'm transporting a fugitive to Chicago.

161
00:08:28,725 --> 00:08:30,525
I need you to clear a car for me.

162
00:08:30,592 --> 00:08:32,258
A fugitive? Yes, that's right.

163
00:08:32,325 --> 00:08:33,358
Well, it's just

164
00:08:33,425 --> 00:08:35,091
That we're already near capacity...

165
00:08:35,158 --> 00:08:37,391
You want him to rub elbows
with your other passengers?

166
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:38,792
No, sir. Okay.

167
00:08:38,859 --> 00:08:40,225
What's he wanted for?

168
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:41,959
Killing people.

169
00:08:42,024 --> 00:08:43,158
Good Lord.

170
00:08:43,225 --> 00:08:44,291
Make it happen.

171
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:46,325
All right, come on, follow me.

172
00:08:58,492 --> 00:09:00,458
It's gonna be all right.

173
00:09:01,525 --> 00:09:04,124
If you say so.

174
00:09:06,091 --> 00:09:08,191
We use him to get what we need,

175
00:09:08,258 --> 00:09:10,725
Then we dump him.

176
00:09:11,758 --> 00:09:13,625
Okay.

177
00:09:19,024 --> 00:09:21,592
I'm sorry you got involved in this.

178
00:09:23,658 --> 00:09:26,058
The fact that you're helping us...

179
00:09:26,124 --> 00:09:28,058
Means a lot.

180
00:09:28,124 --> 00:09:30,391
Thank you.

181
00:09:35,792 --> 00:09:38,358
The other riders aren't
in any danger, are they?

182
00:09:38,425 --> 00:09:40,391
I mean, should I make an
announcement or anything?

183
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:42,692
You want pandemonium?

184
00:09:42,758 --> 00:09:44,758
No, sir. Okay, then no
announcements, right?

185
00:09:46,058 --> 00:09:47,358
Just keep everybody out of this car

186
00:09:47,425 --> 00:09:48,458
Then everything is jake.

187
00:09:48,525 --> 00:09:49,692
I've done this a million times.

188
00:09:49,758 --> 00:09:50,825
Never had a problem.

189
00:09:50,892 --> 00:09:53,024
Okay, will do.

190
00:10:04,325 --> 00:10:06,291
Let's go.

191
00:10:14,558 --> 00:10:17,458
We'll be in Chicago in about five hours.

192
00:10:17,525 --> 00:10:19,492
Want to get some rest.

193
00:10:37,258 --> 00:10:39,358
You okay?

194
00:10:39,425 --> 00:10:41,425
Yeah.

195
00:10:56,725 --> 00:10:57,792
Brad.

196
00:10:57,859 --> 00:10:59,825
You don't look too good.

197
00:10:59,892 --> 00:11:01,058
I helped you with Sara Tancredi,

198
00:11:01,124 --> 00:11:02,725
And you were supposed
to get me into Ad Seg.

199
00:11:02,792 --> 00:11:06,325
I tried.

200
00:11:06,391 --> 00:11:10,358
But your new warden... mm...

201
00:11:10,425 --> 00:11:11,825
Straight as an arrow.

202
00:11:11,892 --> 00:11:16,558
But I might be able to do
you one better than Ad Seg.

203
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:20,758
You found Scofield and Burrows
through the Russian girl, right?

204
00:11:20,825 --> 00:11:23,191
Yeah, Nika. Why?

205
00:11:23,258 --> 00:11:27,792
And you tracked down Bagwell
by following Susan Hollander.

206
00:11:27,859 --> 00:11:30,391
Yeah. And I blow my
nose with my right hand

207
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:32,058
And I wipe my ass with my left.

208
00:11:32,124 --> 00:11:33,892
What of it?

209
00:11:38,692 --> 00:11:41,692
I've got very powerful people behind me

210
00:11:41,758 --> 00:11:44,758
That want me to finish my job.

211
00:11:44,825 --> 00:11:46,525
They can push through the quickest

212
00:11:46,592 --> 00:11:49,625
Habeas corpus proceedings
the courts have ever seen.

213
00:11:49,692 --> 00:11:52,892
Paperwork's sitting on the
right person's desk as we speak,

214
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,892
Setting forth all

215
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:57,959
The Constitutional violations
in your prosecution.

216
00:11:59,692 --> 00:12:02,425
It's just waiting to be rubber-Stamped.

217
00:12:02,492 --> 00:12:06,225
And what do I have to do?

218
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:09,758
You just find those cons.

219
00:12:09,825 --> 00:12:11,658
Only, this time...

220
00:12:11,725 --> 00:12:13,325
You're gonna
do it for me--

221
00:12:13,391 --> 00:12:18,825
Unofficially, under the
radar, no paper trail...

222
00:12:18,892 --> 00:12:22,391
I need a junkyard dog who's
willing to do the ugly things

223
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:25,758
It takes to bring a con to justice.

224
00:12:29,425 --> 00:12:31,391
Are you my dog, Brad?

225
00:12:34,525 --> 00:12:37,625
Damn hell, yeah, I am.

226
00:12:40,825 --> 00:12:42,091
This is delicious.

227
00:12:42,158 --> 00:12:43,825
What'd you call it again?

228
00:12:43,892 --> 00:12:45,325
That, my dear Patty-Cake,

229
00:12:45,391 --> 00:12:48,492
Is what my auntie back in 'Bama
used to call "hobo chicken."

230
00:12:48,558 --> 00:12:51,859
One part chicken, two parts
spice, three part actual hobo.

231
00:12:55,925 --> 00:12:59,991
I know, uh, uh... fowl

232
00:13:00,058 --> 00:13:03,959
Isn't part of a
traditional brunch, per se,

233
00:13:04,024 --> 00:13:06,558
But I have found a lean meat

234
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:10,225
Can act as an aperitif to, uh...

235
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:14,325
Awaken the pallet for more subtle

236
00:13:14,391 --> 00:13:16,859
Flavors and textures,

237
00:13:16,925 --> 00:13:19,225
Such as... (inhales sharply)

238
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:20,525
Mama mia!

239
00:13:20,592 --> 00:13:22,492
Pumpkin cinnamon breads

240
00:13:22,558 --> 00:13:25,458
With fresh strawberries and cream.

241
00:13:25,525 --> 00:13:26,525
Oh, boy!

242
00:13:26,592 --> 00:13:28,725
Mmm! Now, how did you two meet?

243
00:13:29,758 --> 00:13:31,525
Church.

244
00:13:31,592 --> 00:13:32,825
Mm!

245
00:13:33,892 --> 00:13:36,725
After my, uh... accident,

246
00:13:36,792 --> 00:13:40,158
Uh, I was volunteering
with some other amputees.

247
00:13:40,225 --> 00:13:41,825
My parish back home

248
00:13:41,892 --> 00:13:45,658
Did an exchange program
with churches all over

249
00:13:45,725 --> 00:13:47,725
This fine country and... well...

250
00:13:47,792 --> 00:13:49,024
The good Lord

251
00:13:49,091 --> 00:13:51,225
Just saw fit to plop my country rump

252
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:53,959
Right down in the pew beside my Susie Q.

253
00:13:56,058 --> 00:13:57,859
And you just stole her heart.

254
00:13:57,925 --> 00:14:00,091
I'm a regular one-Armed bandit.

255
00:14:00,158 --> 00:14:01,925
A one-Armed bandit...

256
00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:07,792
Mrs. Wallace, Teddy just
bought me a brand-New bike.

257
00:14:07,859 --> 00:14:09,991
It's out in the garage. Wanna go see?

258
00:14:12,291 --> 00:14:14,124
We have got company.

259
00:14:14,191 --> 00:14:15,859
Oh, that's okay.

260
00:14:15,925 --> 00:14:18,058
No, it's not; it's
rude. Zack knows better.

261
00:14:18,124 --> 00:14:19,458
Isn't that right?

262
00:14:22,692 --> 00:14:25,525
You do know better, Zack.

263
00:14:35,925 --> 00:14:37,525
You gotta have discipline.

264
00:14:37,592 --> 00:14:40,425
Without a strong father figure,

265
00:14:40,492 --> 00:14:44,124
A young man might just end up in prison.

266
00:14:56,725 --> 00:14:58,258
<i>Since you are such a fan</i>

267
00:14:58,325 --> 00:15:00,959
Of lame store-Bought blueberry pie,

268
00:15:01,024 --> 00:15:02,925
I am gonna bake you a real pie...

269
00:15:06,358 --> 00:15:07,959
Hi, my name's Lance and I'm an addict.

270
00:15:08,024 --> 00:15:09,692
Hi, Lance.

271
00:15:11,558 --> 00:15:13,425
Hi, Sara.

272
00:15:14,991 --> 00:15:17,191
Hi, my name is not
Lance, I'm not an addict.

273
00:15:29,291 --> 00:15:31,291
Hey, Michael...

274
00:15:31,358 --> 00:15:34,792
Do you know if there's any
way I can get any water?

275
00:15:34,859 --> 00:15:37,091
Yeah, I think there's
a bathroom downstairs.

276
00:15:37,158 --> 00:15:39,158
I'll check. Thanks.

277
00:15:52,492 --> 00:15:53,991
It was never personal, Sara.

278
00:15:54,058 --> 00:15:55,525
War never is.

279
00:15:55,592 --> 00:15:56,892
Yeah.

280
00:16:28,885 --> 00:16:30,352
Sara! (Sara grunting)

281
00:16:39,965 --> 00:16:43,065
You get one of those!
You get one of those.

282
00:16:43,132 --> 00:16:44,265
One.

283
00:16:44,332 --> 00:16:45,998
One.

284
00:16:47,232 --> 00:16:48,465
Down. Get down, right now.

285
00:16:54,499 --> 00:16:55,598
What?

286
00:16:55,664 --> 00:16:57,564
These three guys said they saw

287
00:16:57,631 --> 00:16:59,831
What looked to be a
fight going on in there.

288
00:16:59,898 --> 00:17:01,998
They didn't, all right? Just
get the train to Chicago.

289
00:17:02,065 --> 00:17:03,332
Do I need to notify the police?

290
00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:04,931
You need to do what
I just told you to do.

291
00:17:04,998 --> 00:17:06,664
You take the tickets,
I'll watch the fugitive.

292
00:17:06,731 --> 00:17:08,432
You guys can just
continue to do bong hits,

293
00:17:08,499 --> 00:17:09,831
Or whatever you do back there, okay?

294
00:17:09,898 --> 00:17:11,298
Now would you guys
mind your own business?

295
00:17:11,365 --> 00:17:13,499
Everybody clear?

296
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,200
Great.

297
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,200
Don't interrupt again, please.

298
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:22,100
Just so we're all clear:

299
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,200
If she tries that again...

300
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:26,500
You'll do what?

301
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:28,400
Just stay on the other side of the car.

302
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,300
It wasn't personal, Paul.

303
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,600
Yeah.

304
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,300
Ooh! What're these?

305
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,500
Oh, I'm, uh...

306
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,300
Gonna do some renovations.

307
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:34,200
Uh, I was just tappin' the
sheetrock, lookin' for the stud.

308
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,600
Looks like you already found one.

309
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Whoo! Potty mouth!

310
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,600
Oh!

311
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:45,700
Me and the girls get together
every Friday for book club.

312
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,400
You ought to host it this week
and everybody can meet you.

313
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,300
I'll see you then!

314
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:51,800
Can't wait. Uh-Huh!

315
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,500
This ain't ever gonna work here.

316
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,600
Go pack your things; we're movin'.

317
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,300
Now, hey, if you don't stop me,

318
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:34,100
I'm gonna eat this
whole thing by myself.

319
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,400
Huh?

320
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,200
All right, sweetie, listen.

321
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,700
I'll make a deal with you.

322
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,500
Remember that merry-Go-Round
that we saw today?

323
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:51,100
You're not gonna get a chance
to ride it, if you don't

324
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,100
Eat something. Go ahead.

325
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:55,200
I don't feel good.

326
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,700
Oh, sweetie.

327
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:08,900
Okay, come on.

328
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,500
Let's go, all right?

329
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:13,600
I got you.

330
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,700
Okay, just hold on. Okay, sweet pea?

331
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,000
Check, please?

332
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,000
All right! Nobody move!

333
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,200
Hey, Sara?

334
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,900
How is she?

335
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:57,000
Well, she wants to be alone.

336
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:02,200
So we get what her dad
locked away with that key.

337
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,200
What do we do then?

338
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:06,100
I mean... you saw what they
did with the tape we made.

339
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,500
They're gonna bury
everything we put out there.

340
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,100
That's why we're
keeping him close to us.

341
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,300
He's got a lot of
connections in Washington.

342
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,300
Mm-Hmm.

343
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:16,100
So we get to the cigar
club, open her dad's box...

344
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:19,100
What if the only thing
inside's a bunch of stogies?

345
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,600
I think it's worth making
the trip to find out.

346
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:39,800
Yes?

347
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:40,800
Caroline.

348
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,800
Paul. Where are you?

349
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,000
I need to know exactly what you meant

350
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:48,200
When you said you were
gonna make this right.

351
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,600
I need specifics.

352
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:51,300
Where are you? What's that noise?

353
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:54,100
I'm on a train. I'll be
in Chicago later today.

354
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:55,900
But I need to know specifics.

355
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,200
Where are Burrows and Scofield?

356
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:59,000
Are they with you?

357
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:01,400
Don't worry about them; worry about me.

358
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,500
Paul, there are still
positions in my administration

359
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:07,700
That need to be filled--
Including Chief of Staff.

360
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,300
I want that to be you.

361
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:11,600
When I get to Chicago, we'll meet.

362
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:13,900
We'll talk.

363
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,500
All of it.

364
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,200
Man, I just brought
enough to get a sandwich.

365
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:27,500
I was sitting right there, okay?

366
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,300
If you're lying...

367
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,300
Look, my daughter is sick,
and I don't want to spend

368
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,900
Any more minutes in here than necessary.

369
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,800
Trust me, that is all that I have.

370
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,500
What do you got, sweetheart?

371
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,100
What do you got?

372
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,000
You don't want to listen?!

373
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:00,600
Hey, hey, calm down, man.

374
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:01,300
Shut up!

375
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:02,800
All right.

376
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:04,800
Listen to me, you've got to calm down.

377
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,500
All right, I can help you
get everything that you want.

378
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,500
But you don't want to
hurt anybody else, right?

379
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,200
Come on.

380
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,200
Look, listen. Hey.

381
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,700
Why don't you go ahead
and lock the door,

382
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,100
And turn the closed sign back,

383
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,800
So everybody thinks that this
place is closed, all right?

384
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,500
And then, we can get
everybody away from the window.

385
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:26,000
Is that cool with you?

386
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,100
Everybody's away from
the window, okay? Yeah.

387
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,600
Let's move everybody onto
this side of the room.

388
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,100
Get on this side of the room, everybody.

389
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,400
Let's move to this side of
the room from the window.

390
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:34,700
Move! Everybody, let's get on
this side of the room, okay?

391
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,400
This side of the room.

392
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,200
Why don't you take my daughter, okay?

393
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:39,600
Take her on this side of the room,

394
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:42,000
So that everybody...
everything is gonna be okay.

395
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,500
Everything is gonna be fine.

396
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,700
Because you're not gonna put your hand

397
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:46,900
On another person, right?

398
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,800
Right. We're all good.

399
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:50,500
Yeah.

400
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,800
Y'all good?

401
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,400
We're good, right?

402
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:00,600
Hey, Sara?

403
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:01,600
Come on in.

404
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:10,300
Hey.

405
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,700
I've been sitting here evaluating.

406
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,600
I, uh...

407
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,600
I jumped bail.

408
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:32,900
I'm on the run,

409
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,900
And I just tried to take a man's life.

410
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,800
I'm not using.

411
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:45,600
Which is actually
quite an accomplishment.

412
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:51,700
But three weeks ago, I was a doctor.

413
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,200
You can get that back... all of it.

414
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:59,900
You need to believe that.

415
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:01,900
You believe that?

416
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,600
You think you can get it all back?

417
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:11,400
I choose to have faith.

418
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:16,500
Because without that, I'm nothing.

419
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:21,800
It's the only thing
that's keeping me going.

420
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:29,300
Well... I got two
things keeping me going.

421
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:33,000
First, is that I want the
people who killed my dad.

422
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,000
And actually, the second...

423
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:43,100
Ironically, I probably wouldn't even say

424
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,700
If I hadn't lost him, but, um...

425
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:48,300
You should know that...

426
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:56,800
Uh...

427
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:01,600
The first thing they tell
you when you take the job,

428
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:03,600
(Clears throat) is, um,

429
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,600
Never to fall in love with an inmate.

430
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:02,200
What's going on?

431
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:20,000
Linc. It's locked.

432
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:55,800
Hey! You can't be in here.

433
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,200
Run the roadblock.

434
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:07,300
Man, I can't do that.

435
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,500
Run it!

436
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:47,100
Bradley Bellick, FBI.

437
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:53,300
Brad Bellick, Federal
Bureau of Investigations.

438
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,200
Brad Bellick, FBI.

439
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:59,500
Special Agent Brad Bellick, FBI.

440
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,800
Hi, there, I'm Brad
Bellick with the FBI.

441
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,500
I'm an agent with the FBI, Brad Bellick.

442
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:09,700
Brad Bellick. I'm with the Bureau.

443
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,600
Brad Bellick. I'm with the Bureau.

444
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:18,300
I already talked to the cops,
told them all I had to say.

445
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,300
Yeah, well, I'm no local hayseed cop.

446
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,400
I'm federal.

447
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,500
And you're not going to
get away with lying to me.

448
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,800
I didn't lie to nobody.

449
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:26,900
Really?

450
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,100
"He was just some homeless guy,
hangs around Hancock Square,

451
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,300
"Hitting up college kids for change.

452
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,500
"He's down there all the time.

453
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,500
If he's not there, I don't
know where to find him."

454
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
That's your statement, right?

455
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:38,200
Pretty much.

456
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:40,600
Right. See, the problem is
Charles "Haywire" Patoshik

457
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:43,600
Is a paranoid, who suffers
from fear of crowds,

458
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:45,400
Who's terrified of strangers.

459
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:47,300
If he's anywhere, he's
in the middle of nowhere,

460
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,900
Keeping to himself, being a weirdo.

461
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,200
And? And if you want to get tough...

462
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:53,100
How about I arrest you right now

463
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,900
For hindering a federal investigation?

464
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:56,200
Who they going to believe?

465
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:57,800
An agent with 15 years on the force

466
00:29:57,900 --> 00:30:00,500
And three Presidential Citations

467
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:03,500
Or a piece of white
trash with a juvie record?

468
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,100
I didn't ask him to do it, but
in case you haven't noticed,

469
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,100
I ain't exactly broken up

470
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,300
Over my stepdad's death.

471
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:13,000
Why can't you just leave
this Patoshik guy alone?

472
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:14,200
Where is he?

473
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:18,000
Or do you want to get
locked up... right now?

474
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:26,700
Yeah.

475
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:28,300
I got a lead on Patoshik.

476
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:28,800
Where?

477
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:31,700
I'm on my way.

478
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:33,500
Keep him there.

479
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:35,100
Alone.

480
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,200
Any information on Scofield and Burrows,

481
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:42,700
I want to be notified immediately.

482
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,200
If that works out for you.

483
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:51,600
They're gonna have cops waiting
for us at the next station.

484
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,100
We need to jump then.

485
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,100
And do what?

486
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:56,000
Hide under a barrel?

487
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,500
Linc's right.

488
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,300
Okay, you just put those in there.

489
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:07,600
I'm so sorry about all this.

490
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,700
It's okay, sweet pea.

491
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:16,800
Here's everything right here, man.

492
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:23,400
It's good.

493
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:25,300
All right, everyone in the storage room.

494
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,300
Now.

495
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,100
What?

496
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:30,900
Get back there until the cops show up.

497
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:33,600
No, no, no, no, I can't go back there.

498
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,100
Come on. No.

499
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,000
Look, you kept a cool
head this whole time.

500
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,500
Don't get yourself killed now.

501
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:40,000
You know what? Listen to me.

502
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,100
I'm a wanted man.

503
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,200
Okay?

504
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:46,900
If the police show up here,
they'll take me back to prison,

505
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:48,400
And you know what? That's fine.

506
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:51,400
But my little girl
right here? She's sick.

507
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:53,200
And she's going to be left alone.

508
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:56,900
And I can't let that happen,

509
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:00,400
So can you please let us go?

510
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:14,100
Go!

511
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:16,800
This way. Let's go.

512
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:20,300
All right, everyone in the back.

513
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,200
Move.

514
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:24,300
Not you. No!

515
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,500
You're coming with me.

516
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,800
Go on. Move.

517
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:31,100
Okay, I want you to
stay right here, okay?

518
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:34,900
Go on!

519
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:35,700
Hey.

520
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:40,400
I think you should let her go, man.

521
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,600
(Cocks hammer) Take off. Last chance.

522
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:43,900
You've got the money.

523
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,800
Burglary and assault.

524
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:48,100
Man, hey, that's change,
man, that's little time.

525
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:49,100
But this right here...

526
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,300
You will be in prison
for the rest of your life.

527
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,300
Believe me on that. Unless you want

528
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,400
Your daughter to see you die,

529
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:57,800
Move.

530
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,500
(Grunting, clattering)

531
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:04,800
I'm trying to help you, man!

532
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:09,100
Come here!

533
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,500
Sweetie, stay right there.

534
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:23,700
Oh, no.

535
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:39,400
Who did this?

536
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,100
I did.

537
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:52,800
Is it good?

538
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,200
Thank you.

539
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:10,100
Haywire!

540
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:12,200
Don't move!

541
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:16,000
Run! Larry! Run! Hurry!

542
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:16,800
Hurry! (Barking)

543
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:28,800
Dino, it's Eric.

544
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:30,700
We've got four jumpers.

545
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:32,000
<i>Three males and a female.</i>

546
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:33,100
<i>Call it in</i>

547
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:34,400
And get us to the next station.

548
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:35,500
Do you hear me?

549
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,000
Get us to the next station.

550
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:42,600
The men who pushed through
the roadblock are jumping off

551
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:45,100
The train near mile marker 54,

552
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,500
Freeze! Don't shoot!

553
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,400
Don't shoot!

554
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:33,600
Turn around!

555
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,400
I'm an employee of the train company.

556
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:41,600
Dino, it's Eric. We've got four jumpers.

557
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,600
Three males and a female.

558
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,000
Call it in and get us
to the next station.

559
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,800
Let's go. Come on.

560
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:49,300
They told us to jump and run

561
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:51,500
And not to look back or they'd shoot us.

562
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,100
We need to find a car.

563
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,000
(Phone rings) Yeah.

564
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,600
I got Haywire trapped.

565
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:46,800
Don't do anything.

566
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:48,700
Just hold him until I get there.

567
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:51,800
No problem. I got this wingnut treed.

568
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,100
Caroline.

569
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:17,600
Paul, where are you?

570
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,200
Did you send the police?

571
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:20,700
No, of course not.

572
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,200
How did they know I was on that train?

573
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,600
Paul, I have no idea.

574
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:26,900
I'll let the president know.

575
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:29,000
I contact the president directly.

576
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:32,300
Are Burrows and Scofield with you?

577
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,200
I was expecting to brief the president.

578
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:38,600
You report to me now.

579
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:40,500
Paul?

580
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:44,800
Where did we spend my 35th birthday?

581
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:45,900
What?

582
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:48,000
The restaurant.

583
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:49,600
Where was it? You remember.

584
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:51,800
Don't be ridiculous. I have to go.

585
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:52,800
Do not hang up.

586
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:53,900
I have to go.

587
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:55,600
Just get Burrows and Scofield...

588
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:56,300
Hey.

589
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:58,600
Whoever this is...

590
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,800
Tell Bill Kim that he just screwed up...

591
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:03,700
Big-Time.

592
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:08,200
Paul? Paul?

593
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:37,800
What's all this?

594
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:40,600
Some whacko climbs up
to a grain elevator,

595
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:42,100
People want to watch.
(Sirens approaching)

596
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,500
Oh, God, you were supposed
to keep a handle on things.

597
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:46,000
Do you know what that means?

598
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:49,000
I got you Haywire.
What else do you want?

599
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,800
FBI. He's my chargee.

600
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:27,400
How you doing, Charles?

601
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,900
I don't want to go back to prison.

602
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,400
I don't blame you.

603
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:36,200
I want to go to Holland.

604
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,000
That's not what I expected to hear.

605
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,800
But you can't go there, son.

606
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,300
I just...

607
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,900
I just want to go... here.

608
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,300
See?

609
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:56,900
Yeah.

610
00:39:58,300 --> 00:39:59,400
I'll tell you what.

611
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:03,700
You don't have to go to prison.

612
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:08,300
But you can't go to Holland, either.

613
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:11,100
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. It's okay,

614
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:12,500
It's okay, it's okay.

615
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:15,200
Hey, you're in a tough spot.

616
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,800
You feel trapped, you
got no options, and...

617
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:20,100
Caught in a situation
where you have no control.

618
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:22,800
I know how you feel.

619
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:24,300
I do.

620
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:28,900
It takes its toll on you,
and all you want to do is run.

621
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,100
But run where?

622
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,100
I just want to go.

623
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,200
There's a way out.

624
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:47,300
A way out?

625
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:48,800
Yeah.

626
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:52,200
Of this maze?

627
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:55,400
Yeah.

628
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:03,500
There are private humidors in the back.

629
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:05,500
Each member's name is on their box.

630
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:06,600
Any security?

631
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,500
A receptionist. That's it.

632
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,300
I'm not a wanted fugitive.

633
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:13,300
Give me the key. I'll do it.

634
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:18,600
Want to take a walk?

635
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:19,800
Yeah.

636
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,700
<i>I know you killed your parents</i>

637
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:22,800
Because they hurt you.

638
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:27,200
And I know you killed that
guy yesterday because he was

639
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,000
Hurting Sasha, but what you did...

640
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,200
Was wrong.

641
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,200
You know that.

642
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:38,000
I just want to go.

643
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:42,800
You can.

644
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,000
<i>I want to go now.</i>

645
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:01,600
It's okay.

646
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:25,600
Sara.

647
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:28,200
Um...

648
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:29,400
About before.

649
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:32,000
Me, too.

650
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:41,100
Yeah.
