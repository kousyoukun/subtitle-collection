1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:02,190
Previously on prison break:

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:04,590
Welcome home, boss.

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:06,270
Where's mommy?

4
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:08,040
Mommy is gonna meet us later, okay?

5
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:11,060
I'm not a murderer.

6
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:13,980
Terrence steadman, the
president's brother.

7
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:15,060
I didn't do it.

8
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:16,790
Mr. Steadman, it's contraband.

9
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:19,390
I brought it to protect myself.

10
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:20,800
That's what we're here for.

11
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,210
Can I write a check for the
food? 'Cause I don't have...

12
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:25,030
Hello, Mrs. Hollander.

13
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:27,250
Daddy's home.

14
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:29,340
It's pam. What's going on?

15
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:31,820
I love you. Give cam a kiss for me,okay?

16
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:35,090
You call this number
again, you're a dead man.

17
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:36,980
You want my help, Bill,
and I want my job back.

18
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:37,850
What's your plan?

19
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:40,460
When those brothers get in the van,
it'll be the last thing they ever do.

20
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:44,120
Paul kellerman has a team ready to move
on the caravan just outside of albuquerque.

21
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:46,680
When it goes down,there's sure
to be lots of bullets flying.

22
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:49,620
I need you there to make sure
Paul kellerman catches one.

23
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,200
President reynolds ruined
your life. She ruined my life.

24
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:04,620
You want to take the bitch down,you just found
your inside man, but it's got to be right noW.

25
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:06,100
Let's go!

26
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:23,160
I know the way out!

27
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,130
I want a team flanking west.

28
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:48,800
Give me another team down by the river.

29
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:59,080
Man down! Give me a medevac,asap!

30
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:08,630
Officer tuggle.

31
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:12,310
Officer tuggle?

32
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:17,600
I'm looking for Alexander
Mahone. I'm his direct supervisor.

33
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,930
Sorry to tell you this,sir,
but your boy's been shot.

34
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:30,280
Who are you?

35
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,950
I used to work for the president.

36
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,990
Why are you helping us?

37
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:37,120
Lay down on the floor,now.

38
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,350
Federal agent. Let me through.

39
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:03,850
Air support is telling us that they saw
your vehicle traveling alone down route 46.

40
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:05,620
Route
46--

41
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:08,550
Possible exit route for the
convicts. I was securing it.

42
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,820
No offense,sir,but we're
searching every vehicle.

43
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:14,490
Well,no offense, you either let me
through or you get me your supervisor.

44
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:17,220
I'm supervising this
roadblock,agent kellerman.

45
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,770
I'm sorry, but I need you
to get out of the vehicle.

46
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,080
Sergeant, uh, humphries.

47
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:26,570
Burrows and Scofield have been on
the loose for less than ten minutes.

48
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:31,320
That means,that at this stage, every second is
critical. So if you detain me for one moment more,

49
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:34,810
I will have all of your
jobs,do you understand me?

50
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:38,950
Go ahead. What?

51
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:41,060
Just let him go.

52
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,070
You still haven't answered my question.

53
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:05,840
Why am I helping you?

54
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:08,430
Because the enemy of
my enemy is my friend.

55
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,700
He said something about taking down the
president I'm gonna assume you have a plan.

56
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:15,040
I do.

57
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,770
It was a great dane.
We had a bird hound.

58
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,260
It was very peaceful.

59
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:23,290
Shh-Shh-Shh! One minute she was
breatng. The next,she wasn'T.

60
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:29,720
Turn around.

61
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:48,590
Get up!

62
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:49,860
Get up!

63
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:54,000
Give me one good reason why i
shouldn't blow your brains out!

64
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,010
Because I can give you the one
thing that's gonna set you free.

65
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,750
I know where Terrence steadman is.

66
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,950
How do you know where steadman is?

67
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:43,110
Because I arranged this whole thing.

68
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,260
You arranged to set me up? That's right.

69
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:48,180
You arranged the killing
of all the people I know.

70
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:50,280
I was given orders,I
executed those orders,

71
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:53,430
And now I have a bull's-Eye
on my chest, just like you two.

72
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,000
I don't trust him. Hey.

73
00:05:57,910 --> 00:05:59,460
Lester "rasta" speight

74
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,270
If I wanted you dead,you'd be dead.

75
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:06,990
You guys want to keep running,fine.

76
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:09,530
You want to be free,get in the car.

77
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:11,680
Last time I'm gonna offer.

78
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:18,390
Joliet,Illinois Fox river penitentiary

79
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:40,390
What's up,fish?

80
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:47,680
Looks like you're having
a tough time of it.

81
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:49,870
I'm all right.

82
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:51,490
Well,I'm just curious.

83
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:55,400
Why don't you hang out with the rest of
the ex-Guards that are locked up here?

84
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:58,730
Oh,yeah.

85
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:00,740
There ain't any.

86
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,590
It's just you.

87
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:10,330
Hey,ho-Ho-Hold
up,hold up.

88
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:14,020
Now,I got what's called a mutual
beneficial arrangement in my mind.

89
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:17,460
I'll look out after you, make
sure nobody get up in your mix.

90
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:21,630
And all you got to do is bring me
your dessert after the next meal.

91
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:23,840
It's real simple.

92
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,660
I'm just looking to do my
time. I don't want any trouble.

93
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:30,190
Yeah,there's what you
want,and there's what I want.

94
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,900
Your dessert after the next chow.

95
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:36,380
You bring it to me. You got it?

96
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,020
No. Wrong guy.

97
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,760
Hey! Break it up,convicts!

98
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:45,410
We're good,boss. We're good.

99
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:52,640
You bring me my treats,or
else this goes next level.

100
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:55,460
Do you understand?

101
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:00,610
He asked you a question,boy.

102
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,850
Yeah.

103
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:07,350
I ain't hear him. You
hear him? I ain't hear him.

104
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,410
Yeah, okay.

105
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:12,130
See how easy that was?

106
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:16,110
We're gonna be good friends, man.

107
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,860
Ness City,Kansas

108
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:38,670
There's no reason for
you to be scared,susie Q.

109
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,240
'Cause you see,I've forgiven you.

110
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:47,600
And you,in turn,can forgive
me for my indiscretions,

111
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:52,440
Which are so far in the past, they're nothing
but specks in our respective rearviews.

112
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:58,310
It's been such a long time.

113
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:01,130
You look lovely.

114
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:06,540
Okay. Let's go,right now.

115
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:11,160
We can,we can go away,spend
some time together.

116
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:14,580
Listen,I'm not a victrola, so
please don't play me like one.

117
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:19,170
There's not a white man's chance in harlem
you'd ever leave your children behind.

118
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:22,430
I'm sorry.

119
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:24,760
Don't fret now.

120
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:28,770
When you came to fox river,

121
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,380
And you spat at me like
I was some kind of...

122
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:34,850
Rabid animal...

123
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:40,690
I was happy.

124
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:45,890
'Cause such a visceral reaction could
only come from a woman who still cares.

125
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,670
The children don't know anything.

126
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:54,420
I didn't want to scare them, so I never
told them about you,so please don'T.

127
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:56,880
That is so perfect.

128
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,100
'Cause you see what we got here now?

129
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:07,990
We got ourselves a clean slate.

130
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:11,350
Right?

131
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:19,070
So,this is the conspiracy,huh?

132
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:23,110
Bunch of little boys in suits running
around, trying to kill each other.

133
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,810
It's pathetic.

134
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:29,410
Well,you were a little more
formidable than we anticipated.

135
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:31,910
We don't need compliments
out of you,jackass.

136
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:35,520
Oh,yes,there it is,the
winning Burrows personality.

137
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:39,020
Shut your mouth and drive. The one we
really knew would win over a jury. Good work.

138
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:47,050
Mr. Kim.

139
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:49,950
What the hell is going on out there?

140
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:52,990
Well,it was touch-And-Go there for a
minute, but I got everything handled.

141
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:54,860
Mahone's been shot.

142
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:56,960
Yes,I know,Bill. I was there.

143
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,670
I saw Burrows pull the trigger.
We lost a valuable asset,but...

144
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:01,490
Mahone's alive.

145
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:07,260
That's good. It looked bad.

146
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,360
Where are Burrows and Scofield?

147
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,290
Burrows and Scofield are
dead. And they're in my suv.

148
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:14,580
I'm heading out to bury them right now.

149
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:16,540
Don't bury them.

150
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,410
I need visual confirmation.

151
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:22,830
I'll get you a photo.
I'll say it one more time.

152
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,260
Don't bury them.

153
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:27,410
You know what'll be nice
to hear right now, Bill?

154
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:30,800
A "thank you.¡± I'll report
back when they're in the ground.

155
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:35,400
You leave that on, he'll trace it.

156
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:38,740
Yeah, uh, secret service.
It's untraceable. Thanks.

157
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,360
Hey, baby girl.

158
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:05,580
What? What's the matter?

159
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:08,190
Where's mommy?

160
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:09,930
Ah, come on.

161
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:13,350
I told you that mommy was
helping a friend. All right?

162
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:15,550
Now we're going to see
her real soon. When?

163
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:18,400
Baby...

164
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:21,930
We are going to be with your mommy
real soon. I promise you that.

165
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:24,000
Okay?

166
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,410
I don't believe you.

167
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:32,640
Dede! Dede!

168
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,890
Yo, Trey, it's me,man.

169
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:44,940
What's up?

170
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:46,710
Yo, what's going on with Kacee?

171
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:49,210
I'm at the courthouse.
She's getting arraigned soon.

172
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,440
Okay. Will you talk to
her? Is she all right?

173
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,900
She's in jail!
So,no,she's not all right.

174
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,090
What the hell happened?

175
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:57,360
Listen, your stupid ass think
I wanted it to go down this way?

176
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,210
Whatever. Man, I gotta go. Her
lawyer's gonna be here any minute.

177
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:01,950
No. Listen, listen.

178
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:05,970
Now look, I want you to tell Kacee
to put it all on me,all right?

179
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:09,730
That she didn't know what to
do,she was scared. Okay? All that.

180
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:12,050
Yeah,I already told her to do that.

181
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,260
I'll do the talking.

182
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:29,410
Owen kravecki? That's me.

183
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:31,830
Hey. Ben and phil.

184
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:35,470
Let's get it going before our wives
figure out this is a fishing trip.

185
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:37,810
Where's your gear? I keep it up north.

186
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:39,800
Okay. How long is the flight?

187
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:41,730
Hour 40.

188
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,760
We don't have a choice.

189
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:07,200
Albuquerque,New Mexico

190
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:16,990
Glad you're awake.

191
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:20,490
Collarbone rotator cuff.

192
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:22,920
Six inches to the right,you're dead.

193
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,150
Yeah,he just woke up.

194
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:37,040
Mr. Mahone. Bill kim.

195
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:40,290
You're a lucky man. Am I?

196
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:42,300
Kellerman finished the job you couldn'T.

197
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:45,170
But he,unfortunately,is still out there.

198
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:47,370
And he's a loose end.

199
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,770
You have to finish what you
were supposed to take care of.

200
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:53,330
Something funny?

201
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:57,300
Keller is more of a loose
end than you realize.

202
00:14:58,070 --> 00:14:59,890
He shot me.

203
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:04,000
That guy... you wanted to
double-Cross screwed you first.

204
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,040
Scofield and Burrows...

205
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:09,080
Are probably alive,

206
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:11,420
And on the run with kellerman.

207
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,130
Have a good day,kimmy.

208
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,390
We neutered kellerman.

209
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:26,000
He doesn't even
officially exist anymore.

210
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:30,650
He knows everything.

211
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,770
Blackfoot,Montana

212
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:41,330
Reports have been coming
in from new mexico officials

213
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:44,770
That escaped convicts Michael
Scofield and Lincoln Burrows

214
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:48,640
Have somehow managed to extricate
themselves from a transport van

215
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:51,250
That was bringing them
back to the chicago area.

216
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:54,190
According to this early
information,the convicts were--

217
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:55,930
You're great.

218
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:58,770
Top-Notch. I swear to go

219
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:01,860
Don't get yourself
work up, Mr. Steadman.

220
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:04,620
I was supposed to have
my life back by now.

221
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,530
Playing golf...

222
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:11,910
Going to movies... seeing people,

223
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:16,760
But because you guys can't get a handle
on an engineer and a petty crook...

224
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:20,590
I've been a ship in a
bottle for over three years.

225
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:22,260
Perfectly safe here.

226
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,350
I wish.

227
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,270
I just spoke to kim.

228
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:40,110
He wants you to finish the job.

229
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:41,570
Yeah?

230
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,010
Well, that's not gonna happen.

231
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:45,490
This isn't a request.

232
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:47,580
And this isn't a negotiation.

233
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:51,440
Kim and kellerman can try to
kill each other all day long.

234
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:55,330
But I'm out.

235
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:58,620
You must have forgotten how discreet
we've been with what we know.

236
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:01,050
Go tell the world about
shales. In fact I will.

237
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:04,770
I killed a predator, a man who tortured and
raped women and I buried him in my backyard.

238
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:06,540
I'll do the time.

239
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,770
I don't care anymore. I'm out.

240
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:11,360
Is that clear enough for you?

241
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:48,040
My man.

242
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:58,000
That's delicious.

243
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:02,170
Hold up, hold up, hold up.

244
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:03,870
We've got a problem.

245
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:06,630
There's one brownie.

246
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:08,930
There's five of my boys.

247
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:11,790
You see the position you put me in?

248
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,930
They gotta stand there with their stomachs
growling will I savor this delicious treat.

249
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:19,360
That makes me look like a real asS.

250
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:27,080
Are you trying to make
me look like an ass?

251
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:30,260
You said the deal was I was
supposed to bring you one dessert.

252
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:32,020
Yeah, well...

253
00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:34,480
I'm fickle, bitch.

254
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,710
Now it's five desserts.

255
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:39,130
Every meal.

256
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:42,940
Now, if you can't come up with thaT...

257
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:47,250
There are other ways to making me happy.

258
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:51,590
Well, I've got some other candy
on me if you want some of that.

259
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:54,560
Well bring it out, bitch. It's
all good. Y'all want some candy?

260
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:26,330
If memory serves, I was at
storytime village that day, too.

261
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:30,130
And I'm not in any of these
pictures? I could have sworn I was.

262
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:34,340
I'm just teasing, baby.

263
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:37,180
Every woman has burned the
photographs of her paramour

264
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:42,120
Only to later realize her love burns
even harder than the flame she used.

265
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:47,610
Please!

266
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:55,640
Teddy!

267
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,170
Uncle teddy!

268
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:00,890
How's my girl been? Good.

269
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,020
You still getting more
a's than an aardvark?

270
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:05,720
Yeah, I missed you!

271
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:09,160
Oh, same here, shortcake.
Yes, i painted my hair.

272
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:11,740
Look at you, Zack.

273
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,670
You are a boy no more.

274
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:17,330
I'm gonna have to lend
you my razor soon enough.

275
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:22,290
What are you doing here? Mom said
you got a job on an oil rigger?

276
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:26,310
That's right, right out
in the middle of the ocean.

277
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:28,970
But those metallic beasts are dangerous.

278
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:31,010
Got myself injured.

279
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:33,850
And don't be... don't
be frightened now, sugar.

280
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:40,600
The good lawyers at dewey, cheatham and howe
got me a million bones for every digit I lost.

281
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:43,230
Five million dollars?

282
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:49,420
Which means with all that cash,
I can do anything I want now.

283
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:54,500
And all I want to do is spend
all my money and all my time

284
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:57,200
With you.

285
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:05,610
CUBACK.MONTANA

286
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,630
What's the neighborhood like?

287
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:14,330
No neighborhood.The
house sits on 50 acres.

288
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:15,990
We coming out the way we go in?

289
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,670
No,there's a back road we take.

290
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,710
How many guards?

291
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,300
Usually none. At this point,

292
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:22,780
I really couldn't tell you.

293
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,960
The second I feel this thing going bad,

294
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:27,160
You get a bullet in the head.

295
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:31,180
I expect nothing less.

296
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:34,890
I will inform you every half hour.

297
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,070
Understood.

298
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:39,660
Private jet was chartered 
by owen kravecki this morning.

299
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:41,220
Headed where?   Montana.

300
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:44,520
Stop it from taking off.

301
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:46,230
It's already on the ground,sir.

302
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:49,160
Call Steadman

303
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:57,350
If that's my sister, I
would  like to speak to her.

304
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,620
Yes?

305
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:05,940
Right away, sir.

306
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:08,480
Evac.

307
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:11,310
Mr. Steadman, do you have
a jacket? We need to leave.

308
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:13,470
Leave? What?No.

309
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:16,160
Agents will be arriving shortly
 to take you to a safe house.

310
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:18,510
W-What do I need to be kept safe from?

311
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:19,920
Do you have a jacket, sir?

312
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:21,170
I don't want to leave.

313
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:22,660
I want to talk to my sister.

314
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:25,220
I've been authorized to
use force if necessary.

315
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:27,430
Now, is there anything
you'd like to bring?

316
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:33,500
My meds.

317
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:37,560
Go with him.Car's here in five minutes.

318
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,460
I don't know, stella.

319
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:45,880
She won't come out.

320
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:48,790
Who wants to be up in
the trailer all day, huh?

321
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:49,930
Would you?

322
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,270
Exactly, me, neither.

323
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:54,460
You feel like baking a pie or something?

324
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:56,860
A little cherry or lemon meringue?

325
00:22:57,170 --> 00:22:58,810
Daddy?

326
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:01,860
Is mommy in trouble, like you?

327
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:10,910
Sweetheart, come here.

328
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:19,150
Now, you listen to me, okay?

329
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:22,700
Mommy did nothing wrong.

330
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,880
She's helping out a friend.

331
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,400
Okay?

332
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,610
Okay, let me go see how
mommy's doing, all right?

333
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:35,840
I want to come.I want to talk to her.

334
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:39,320
No, no, no. You sit here
like a good little girl, okay?

335
00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:41,380
Don't give me that.

336
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:43,960
Hello?   Things are looking up.

337
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:47,450
Ah, that's what I wanted to
hear. Man, kick it down to me.

338
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:49,390
Her lawyer seems like
he knows what he's doing.

339
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,920
He thinks he can get the bail reduced.

340
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:52,540
Good. All right, listen.

341
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:56,410
When Kacee gets out I want you
to deliver this message for me.

342
00:23:56,420 --> 00:24:00,780
Okay?Tell her that we can all get lost.

343
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:02,950
You want her to jump bail now?

344
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:06,230
Boy, you better  be glad you ain't in front of
my face or I'd have my hands around your neck.

345
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,040
Listen, punk, just deliver the message.

346
00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:10,850
Okay, then what y'all
gonna do? Go live in a cave?

347
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,120
I got a plan, all right?

348
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:14,590
All right, well, let's hear it.

349
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:20,380
This guy back in my
unit when I was in iraq.

350
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:24,260
He used to go up to alaska and
work at these fish hatcheries, man.

351
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:27,220
They pay you cash and
nobody asks questions.

352
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:29,870
Alaska? Yeah, alaska, man.

353
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:31,440
They don't bother you up there, man.

354
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:34,350
You know, me, Kacee and dede,
we  could be a family again.

355
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,460
You feel me?

356
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:36,430
Man, you don't quit.

357
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,620
You damn straight I don't quit.

358
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:42,650
Do I get to know where I'm going?

359
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:45,380
You'll get all the information
 you need upon arrival.

360
00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:48,760
Yes?   We need to move
steadman to location beta.

361
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:50,440
We're sending a car to pick him up.

362
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,370
It's already here, sir.

363
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:55,030
Couldn't be.

364
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,260
The car just left.

365
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:00,820
Weapons down.

366
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,900
Now!

367
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:08,840
Down

368
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:10,610
Put your weapons down!

369
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,660
Whoa, don't get stupid.

370
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:17,560
Put your weapons down.

371
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:19,200
On the ground. Now!

372
00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:22,310
Terrence, step away. Get in the car.

373
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:25,420
You look pretty good for a dead man.

374
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:26,300
Get in the car!

375
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:27,430
Wh-Where? Why?

376
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,240
Who's there?

377
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:30,200
It's kellerman.He's got steadman.

378
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:32,520
Do not let him escape.

379
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:36,940
Kill steadman.Kill them all now.

380
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:42,760
Paul, please, wait. Don't, don'T.

381
00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:43,630
Get in!   Don't kill me.

382
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,440
Get in the car!

383
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,670
Let's go

384
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,170
Vomiting.

385
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:07,760
It's the worst side
effect of anesthesia.

386
00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:10,820
That should be the last of it.

387
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,970
You figure I'm on empty by now?

388
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,230
Pam?

389
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,890
Alex, Cameron's been
hurt. What happened?

390
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:28,690
It was a car, a hit-And-Run.
He's in the hospital.

391
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:31,180
His leg is broken in two places.

392
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:32,900
I'll be on the next
flight to Colorado, okay?

393
00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:34,060
He's in surgery now.

394
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:35,900
I'll be right there.Just
hold on.Just hold on.

395
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:37,300
They won't let me see him.

396
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:40,700
They call me at work,I come right 
here and now they won't let me see him.

397
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:42,990
Pam,please just.Keep it 
together until I get there.

398
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,120
Please,can you do that for me,okay?

399
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:46,390
Please hurry.

400
00:26:46,810 --> 00:26:48,530
Mr.Mahone,you cannot get on a plane.

401
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:50,910
You need to stay at least 
another day for observation.

402
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:53,150
You've been shot.

403
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,920
Mr.Mahone,please.

404
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:56,940
I gotta go see my son.

405
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:58,770
Mr.Mahone,I understand.

406
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:01,050
Please.At least stay
and talk to a doctor.

407
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:02,750
Taxi!Hey!

408
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:10,380
How's your boy?

409
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:13,080
Tib-Fib fractures are bad.

410
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:15,260
But if the growth plate's affected,

411
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:16,890
There's a whole host of problems.

412
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:19,370
You made a mistake.   No,you did.

413
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:22,550
You think you can just quit
like you work at a post office?

414
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:25,360
Now,you're needed back in.

415
00:27:25,370 --> 00:27:26,700
Go clean up your mess.

416
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:30,890
Maybe there won't be another accident
on the streets of Durango, Colorado.

417
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:36,020
Understand?

418
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:45,760
Every road shut down, every
car stopped and searched.

419
00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:47,970
I don't care if it's a group
of nuns touring yellowstone.

420
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:49,550
Their camper gets turned inside out.

421
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,130
Logistically speaking, every
 road's gonna take some time.

422
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:52,660
It's montana.

423
00:27:52,930 --> 00:27:54,610
Not manhattan.

424
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:57,320
Get it done. Yes,sir.

425
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:05,760
If we get a camera,we can take a picture
of him holding a current newspaper.

426
00:28:05,770 --> 00:28:08,150
If we put that on-Line,well,
that'll prove he's still alive.

427
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:12,260
It'll prove that we found a guy that looks
 like kind of like the president's brother.

428
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:13,710
Fingerprints, dental records?

429
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:14,850
We white-Washed him.

430
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:17,660
Pulled his teeth, burned
off his fingerprints.

431
00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:18,850
DnA.

432
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:22,660
To compare against the homeless guy
we killed and put in steadman's car,

433
00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:24,640
But we destroyed all
exterior dna samples,

434
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:26,860
So that there'd be
nothing to compare them to.

435
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:30,090
There's gotta be someone somewhere
who can identify this man.

436
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:32,090
Which is why we did the surgery.

437
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:35,460
Cheek bones raised two centimeters,
ears lowered a quarter of an inch.

438
00:28:35,770 --> 00:28:38,260
Not so much that someone who 
knew him wouldn't recognize him,

439
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:43,700
But enough that any forensic comparison of a photograph
 of that man would conclude that he is a look-Alike.

440
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:45,940
A hoax.Trust me.

441
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:49,200
We are very good at what we do.

442
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,150
Please just let me go.

443
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:57,130
Terrence, you've made every man in this
 room a prisoner, including yourself.

444
00:28:58,310 --> 00:28:59,550
It's time to set us free.

445
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:01,870
Nothing you do will work.

446
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:02,790
They will not let it.

447
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:05,780
Cut the victim act, Terrence.

448
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:10,140
He was more than happy to play along when he was lining 
his pockets with taxpayer money funneled through ecofield.

449
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:13,370
And then,when the
indictment is about to fall,

450
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:15,510
Who do you come running
to for help,Terrence?

451
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:23,690
Now we are gonna stay here for a day or two,
until they think we're a thousand miles away.

452
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:27,820
And then we're gonna
make our way to dc. Okay?

453
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:34,120
So that's the plan?We take him to a
city  crawling with company and feds?

454
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:38,190
And government agents,still in power,who've 
been working from the inside with your father,

455
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:42,520
People who can get that this pain in the 
ass to safely tell his story,on the record.

456
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:45,140
And we just stroll right
into the lion's den then,huh?

457
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:46,640
Pray we don't get mauled.

458
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:48,390
I don't think they're
gonna come to montana,

459
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,760
Scofield,so we're gonna go to them.

460
00:29:52,910 --> 00:29:54,410
No,leave her alone!

461
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:55,660
What do you want with her?

462
00:29:55,670 --> 00:29:57,280
What I want is.

463
00:29:57,290 --> 00:29:59,650
To date her.

464
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:04,590
I'll make us some more popcorn.

465
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:10,190
Honey,if any of us could eat
any more corn,I'd be a-Maized.

466
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,570
See what I did there,gracey?

467
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:15,960
Indian word for corn is
maize and I said "a-Maized."

468
00:30:16,050 --> 00:30:19,460
I don't get it.I'm corn-Fused.

469
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:22,450
You are smarter than a bee sting.

470
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:25,460
Second female president
of these united states,

471
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:28,470
Right here watching tv with us.

472
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:32,900
Look what I did.

473
00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:34,010
Honey,that's all right.

474
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:35,240
No,I'll get a rag.

475
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:36,910
No,I can.

476
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:45,470
I thought we had wiped the slate clean.

477
00:30:47,890 --> 00:30:49,380
Please.

478
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:52,910
I thought we had put the
past where it belonged.

479
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,100
We did.

480
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:55,980
We did put the past where it belonged.

481
00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:57,650
Do not.

482
00:30:57,890 --> 00:31:00,300
Do not lie to me,woman.

483
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:02,770
After turncoatin' me to the authorities,

484
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:06,300
After ruinin' everything we had,after
 breakin' my heart into so many pieces

485
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:09,560
That I will never be able to
find  them all,you can at least.

486
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:13,970
Do me the favor as to not
stand  there and lie to my face!

487
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:15,380
Mom?

488
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:18,790
Zack,you get your ass
back on that couch.

489
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:22,330
Get gracey!Go!

490
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:34,160
I gave y'all a chance.

491
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:36,980
Remember that.

492
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:06,300
Open on 22.

493
00:32:10,890 --> 00:32:13,580
Dude,you're crazy.

494
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:15,350
Is that what the other cons are saying?

495
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,310
Yeah.   Good.

496
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:19,200
But you took it to banks?

497
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:20,990
I don't think you want to
 be messing with him,man.

498
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,190
I'll mess with anybody
who  tries to punk me out.

499
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:28,440
Hey,you know I just been. Testing you.

500
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:31,320
Yeah,well,the test results came back.

501
00:32:31,570 --> 00:32:33,620
And top bunk's mine now.

502
00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:35,430
You got a problem with that?

503
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:47,380
Hey,what's up,stolte?

504
00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:49,790
You screwed up,brad,big-Time.

505
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:53,090
No,I had a message to send,and
 that message got delivered.

506
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:55,730
The guy you
schlocked-Banks--

507
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:58,980
He's got connections with
the  guards working nights.

508
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:03,840
Word is,banks is gonna have you
 pulled out of your cell tonight.

509
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:05,710
Well,can't you do nothing?

510
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:09,310
Yeah,I can warn you,which
is what I'm doing.

511
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,630
Well,can't you talk to some
 of the guys working nights?

512
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:14,610
They're working nights 'cause
 you put them on nights.

513
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:16,640
You should've treated the 
men better when you were here.

514
00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:18,540
They ain't gonna do you any favors,brad.

515
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:21,060
I treated you right,didn't I?

516
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:22,750
Come on,stolte.

517
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:24,200
Can't you do something?

518
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:25,160
Please?

519
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:27,340
You did treat me right,

520
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:31,740
But there is nothing I can
 do now except warn you.

521
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:33,830
Watch your back.

522
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:45,730
We can use the fire roads that the  park
rangers use in glacier national park.

523
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:47,190
They don't patrol them at night.

524
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,970
We get up into canada,we head
east, we cut down through new york.

525
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:51,610
The borders won't be a problem.

526
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:53,510
No,nobody will look for us there.

527
00:33:54,330 --> 00:33:55,470
This is.

528
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,800
Fun for you,Terrence,really?

529
00:33:56,810 --> 00:33:57,740
No,no,this isn't fun.

530
00:33:57,750 --> 00:34:00,910
What was fun was when caroline
 and I would talk about you,

531
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:03,790
And the schoolboy crush
that you had on her.

532
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,830
He proposed to her.

533
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:13,230
You actually thought that you would be  the
first husband,the serf who would be king?

534
00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:17,360
We laughed so hard.

535
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:20,610
You stood there and
watched them kill veronica!

536
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:21,270
Burrows!

537
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,990
And you did nothing!    Burrows!

538
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,360
She died because of you!

539
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,120
Shut up!

540
00:34:33,130 --> 00:34:35,200
Burrows,he has no value to us dead.

541
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:36,490
He has no identity.

542
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:38,300
You kill him,you have just a john doe.

543
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:39,080
Just put your gun down.

544
00:34:39,090 --> 00:34:41,770
When he puts his
down.Linc,we're so close.

545
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:43,550
Was it worth it?

546
00:34:43,570 --> 00:34:45,860
Killing those people,ruining my life?

547
00:34:45,870 --> 00:34:46,730
Scofield,get a handle on your brother.

548
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:48,580
Shut up.You're not
helping.You're not helping.

549
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:50,490
Linc,you don't want to do this.

550
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:52,080
Trust me.

551
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:53,730
This isn't what you want.

552
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:56,420
You don't want to do this.Okay?

553
00:34:56,530 --> 00:34:58,160
Trust me.

554
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:17,130
So many people dead.

555
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:21,760
And he gets to live.

556
00:35:26,930 --> 00:35:28,730
Hello.Hello.

557
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,090
They denied bail.

558
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:31,080
What?

559
00:35:31,090 --> 00:35:32,980
Judge didn't buy that it was all you.

560
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:34,750
Case is going into the system now.

561
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,180
Aiding an escaped con.

562
00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:38,350
She's looking at major time,man.

563
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:41,410
All right,uh.

564
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,200
I want you to tell
her lawyer-All right,

565
00:35:50,210 --> 00:35:52,710
You listen to me-You tell her lawyer.

566
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:57,490
I love you.

567
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,040
Tell her lawyer I'll
turn myself in,okay?

568
00:36:00,050 --> 00:36:02,040
No.Kacee said you need to run.

569
00:36:02,050 --> 00:36:05,320
If you get busted or turn yourself
 in,dede won't have either of you.

570
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:07,200
And they'll just throw
her into foster care.

571
00:36:08,350 --> 00:36:10,630
Look,man,I'm gonna hang
up this phone right now,

572
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,620
'Cause I feel I might
say something I regret.

573
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:14,030
Yo.

574
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:16,410
You just take care of dede.

575
00:36:28,930 --> 00:36:30,800
You know that.

576
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:34,690
My daddy wasn't really in the 
picture much when I was growing up.

577
00:36:35,330 --> 00:36:39,470
So as a result,I never really
 learned the art of carpentry.

578
00:36:39,890 --> 00:36:42,270
But I figure,jesus was a carpenter,

579
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:46,770
And his daddy wasn't around to
 teach him,so I taught myself.

580
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:51,310
Over time,I got to be a pretty
 good swinger of the hammer.

581
00:36:52,690 --> 00:36:55,430
Now,the good news is,

582
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:59,140
Unlike my papa and the great almighty,

583
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:02,180
I'm here for good.

584
00:37:03,070 --> 00:37:05,200
Don't make no mistake about it.

585
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:09,740
We will be a family.

586
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:13,670
If it kills us.

587
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:33,970
So sweet.

588
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:42,670
Car's out front.

589
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:44,140
Let's get covered up and move ouT.

590
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:46,210
These two are never gonna
make it in a car together.

591
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:47,780
You're gonna have to keep
your brother in check.

592
00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:49,230
You don't know him.

593
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,820
Then get my gun from him.

594
00:37:50,830 --> 00:37:51,880
We don't have time for this.

595
00:37:51,890 --> 00:37:54,510
You still think you're 
running the show,don't you?

596
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:56,720
You still think I'm not?

597
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:09,240
Yes.I'd like the number 
for channel 11 news,please.

598
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:10,930
What are you doing?

599
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:12,790
This is not the plan.Hang up.

600
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,090
Yes,connect me.I'll hold.

601
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:17,280
Scofield,you call the
news, they call the cops.

602
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:20,800
Yes,put me through.   Hang up.

603
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:27,740
Hang up the phone now!

604
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:30,360
Hang it up!

605
00:38:31,970 --> 00:38:34,310
Channel 11 news.Can I help you?

606
00:38:34,870 --> 00:38:36,500
This is Michael Scofield.

607
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:39,400
I'm at the cutback motel,room 11.

608
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:45,920
And I want to turn myself in.

609
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:53,410
Banks Brad.Ley.

610
00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:58,150
Brad.Ley.

611
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:05,650
Warden's gone home,bitch.

612
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:08,130
Mice are gonna play.

613
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:11,080
Brad.

614
00:39:21,170 --> 00:39:24,720
If anything jumps off,you get
 my back,I won't forget it.

615
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:27,260
Why don't you just forget it right now?

616
00:39:27,270 --> 00:39:29,610
You're in this cell,you're top bunk.

617
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:34,050
Out there,you're on your own.

618
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:36,890
Brad.Ley.

619
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:41,420
You want a piece of
me,you sons of bitches?

620
00:39:41,430 --> 00:39:44,050
Come and get me! You hear me?

621
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:47,010
I ain't scared of you!

622
00:39:47,530 --> 00:39:50,010
I ain't scared of nothing!

623
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:05,000
Start praying.

624
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:17,810
Yes.   Mr.Kim.

625
00:40:19,110 --> 00:40:21,130
I just wanted you to know that

626
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:24,140
I'm getting back to work.

627
00:40:26,470 --> 00:40:28,100
Good.

628
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:31,130
So I take it you got my message.

629
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:33,860
Oh,yeah.

630
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:38,070
Loud and clear.

631
00:40:48,370 --> 00:40:50,670
Please,come on.Please,please.

632
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:52,390
I'm sorry,Terrence.It's too late.

633
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,120
The press is already on their way.

634
00:40:54,130 --> 00:40:56,270
You can put the guns away now.

635
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:59,000
This goes wrong,you
guys are on your own.

636
00:40:59,010 --> 00:41:01,910
No,if-If-If I go back 
home,okay,let me,please.

637
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:04,740
I'll go back.Terrence,none
of us can,okay?

638
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:07,360
So just relax and keep your head.

639
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,950
Okay,okay.

640
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:13,090
Terrence! Terrence!

641
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:14,670
I'm leaving!

642
00:41:17,950 --> 00:41:20,050
Terrence,we can't let
you do that,Terrence.

643
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:21,020
Terrence,all we need is your mouth.

644
00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:23,200
I will shoot out both
your knees right now.

645
00:41:23,210 --> 00:41:24,530
I never liked you,Paul.

646
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:27,470
I won't hesitate to take your life!

647
00:41:30,270 --> 00:41:31,870
All right.Just.

648
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:33,540
Terrence,listen to me.

649
00:41:33,550 --> 00:41:34,890
Just listen.

650
00:41:35,490 --> 00:41:38,930
Terrence,for once in your
 life,do the right thing.

651
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:40,220
All right?

652
00:41:41,050 --> 00:41:44,060
So many people have suffered 
because of this,because of you.

653
00:41:44,850 --> 00:41:48,700
But when the press get
here, you can tell the truth.

654
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:50,850
You can end this.

655
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:53,950
Where does it end for me?

656
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:56,060
Disgrace, life in prison?

657
00:41:56,070 --> 00:41:58,150
You're already in prison, Terrence.

658
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:01,540
How many more people have to die so you can
 stay locked up in some cabin in the woods?

659
00:42:01,550 --> 00:42:03,520
It's over.

660
00:42:11,850 --> 00:42:13,470
Okay.

661
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:16,570
Okay.

662
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:23,600
Sorry.

663
00:42:23,610 --> 00:42:25,520
Terrence, no!

664
00:42:47,350 --> 00:42:48,710
We have to go.

665
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:50,750
Go where? We got steadman.

666
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:52,590
No, we have nothing.

667
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:57,900
All we got is a john doe.

668
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:02,850
Michael.

669
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:06,150
