1
00:00:01,134 --> 00:00:02,396
Previously on Prison Break:

2
00:00:02,569 --> 00:00:03,866
So where to, man?

3
00:00:04,037 --> 00:00:06,198
Anywhere we want.

4
00:00:08,174 --> 00:00:11,234
I'm not the brother you remember.
I've changed.

5
00:00:11,411 --> 00:00:13,038
And I am gonna do something...

6
00:00:13,213 --> 00:00:15,374
...a lot of people
are gonna think is horrible.

7
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:20,180
And you just remember
the brother you grew up with.

8
00:00:20,754 --> 00:00:22,517
She's not here.

9
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:25,785
-Yeah?
-Sara, the ship is leaving.

10
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:28,255
I'm already onboard.

11
00:00:28,728 --> 00:00:30,389
Love you.

12
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:34,494
Why are you telling me this now?

13
00:00:34,667 --> 00:00:37,534
If I had to do it all over again...

14
00:00:38,138 --> 00:00:39,605
...I'd do it different, you know.

15
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:43,039
Collarbone and rotator cuff.

16
00:00:43,309 --> 00:00:45,106
Six inches to the right and you're dead.

17
00:00:45,278 --> 00:00:48,714
-You've come so far.
-How much further would I have to go?

18
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:51,214
You're lucky. For this,
you only have to go to Panama.

19
00:00:52,919 --> 00:00:54,147
-He found him.
-Where?

20
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,448
-Just boarded a plane to Panama City.
-What's he doing in Panama?

21
00:00:57,624 --> 00:01:01,924
-You like wigs?
-For the right money, I like anything.

22
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,328
What about the message board?
The Goldfinch thing?

23
00:01:10,503 --> 00:01:13,336
-There is a message from Sucre.
-Still running, huh?

24
00:01:13,506 --> 00:01:15,064
He says, "The Bag still has the bag.

25
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:17,368
He's in Panama City
at the Fin Del Camino Hotel.

26
00:01:17,544 --> 00:01:20,138
If you're there and wanna help
put that bird in the cage...

27
00:01:20,313 --> 00:01:23,407
-...Iet me know. Sucre."
-See you soon.

28
00:01:35,462 --> 00:01:36,759
Christina Rose
PANAMA

29
00:01:37,831 --> 00:01:39,264
Michael!

30
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:42,100
Michael!

31
00:01:48,741 --> 00:01:50,436
Michael!

32
00:03:07,053 --> 00:03:10,784
Scofield, one thing's for sure.
You're just as pretty as advertised.

33
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:14,687
-Prettier even.
-You ' ve gotta help me. Please.

34
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:26,399
I'm coming for you. Are you ready?

35
00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:28,931
No.

36
00:03:29,108 --> 00:03:30,871
I'm coming for you....

37
00:03:38,651 --> 00:03:41,814
Say a word and I will cut your throat out,
you old whore.

38
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:47,820
Scofield.

39
00:04:52,158 --> 00:04:54,126
-Hello.
-Pam, it's me.

40
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:57,058
-Cam 's napping.
-Yeah? How's he doing?

41
00:04:57,230 --> 00:05:00,529
Good. It was his first day
back in school.

42
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,861
-That's great.
-Where are you?

43
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:05,800
I'm out of the country.

44
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:07,234
Is everything all right?

45
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:13,510
Remember how I always said that
the day would come and I'd be done?

46
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,310
-Leave the Bureau and never look back?
- Yes.

47
00:05:18,518 --> 00:05:20,679
Today's that day.

48
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:22,687
I have one more thing to do.

49
00:05:22,855 --> 00:05:24,516
And once I do it...

50
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:29,552
...everything is gonna fall into place
and I'll be done.

51
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:32,220
-Well, I hope you mean it.
-Pam.

52
00:05:32,398 --> 00:05:36,528
If I didn't have this job anymore,
or if I were free....

53
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:38,428
If I were free....

54
00:05:38,604 --> 00:05:42,665
-Alex.
-I need to know.

55
00:05:43,242 --> 00:05:46,177
I'm not saying no.

56
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:52,284
I will make this right, I swear to God.

57
00:05:52,452 --> 00:05:55,387
And you and me and Cam....

58
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:58,414
I have to go.

59
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:01,224
I've never stopped loving you, Pam.

60
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:05,255
-Ever.
-Just be safe, Alex.

61
00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:13,870
-You in position?
- Yeah.

62
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:17,199
-I'll be there in 1 0 minutes.
-Got it.

63
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:54,574
Michael.

64
00:06:55,114 --> 00:06:56,672
What's wrong?

65
00:06:56,849 --> 00:06:59,249
Que pasa, Scofield?

66
00:07:01,821 --> 00:07:04,415
Come on, move it.

67
00:07:09,495 --> 00:07:10,826
I love it.

68
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:14,722
Mr. Above-lt-All down here
trying to sniff out that 5 million...

69
00:07:14,901 --> 00:07:16,596
...just like the rest of us riff-raff.

70
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:18,327
See, you ain't no better than me.

71
00:07:18,504 --> 00:07:21,337
I want T-Bag locked up.
That's the only reason I'm here.

72
00:07:21,507 --> 00:07:24,169
Oh, Dudley freaking Do-Right, huh?

73
00:07:24,577 --> 00:07:27,171
-I didn't know you were here.
-What are you talking about?

74
00:07:27,346 --> 00:07:29,940
You e-mailed me, said T-Bag was here.
It's on the website.

75
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:33,313
What? No.
I didn't write anything on no website.

76
00:07:33,486 --> 00:07:34,851
To you or anybody else.

77
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:37,285
Is T-Bag in that hotel?

78
00:07:38,257 --> 00:07:41,522
Yeah, and a couple of feds
staking it out across the street.

79
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:45,561
-You're gonna help us get it.
-Maybe you missed the part about the feds.

80
00:07:45,731 --> 00:07:48,928
I don't care. I didn't travel 2000 miles
down the Diarrhea Trail...

81
00:07:49,101 --> 00:07:52,002
...to get to this backward-ass country
to not get my 5 million.

82
00:07:52,171 --> 00:07:55,402
Well, that's too bad.
This is looking more and more like a setup.

83
00:07:55,575 --> 00:07:59,011
Well, then, get that little
college boy brain of yours to work, then.

84
00:07:59,178 --> 00:08:03,911
And if you don't think I'm serious, just ask
your old cellie here what length I'll go to.

85
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:06,580
He's got Maricruz
locked away somewhere.

86
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:11,316
Either I help him get the money,
or she's dead.

87
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:15,385
Yeah, I'm a big jerk, Scofield.
Shame on me.

88
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:20,823
Michael, I'm in no position
to ask you for anything.

89
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:25,202
I need your help, papi.

90
00:08:26,105 --> 00:08:27,834
I do.

91
00:08:30,776 --> 00:08:34,109
Are you in, or what?

92
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:11,139
-Get the gun off me.
-I asked you a question.

93
00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:13,615
I said get the gun off me, or I walk.

94
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:21,590
All right, you'll get your 5 million...

95
00:09:22,428 --> 00:09:25,591
...you get Maricruz and I get T-Bag.

96
00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:28,893
-Win-win-win.
-But you gotta do exactly what I say.

97
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:34,172
Thank you, bro.

98
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:38,900
All right, Einstein.

99
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:40,306
What you thinking?

100
00:09:42,882 --> 00:09:46,909
And it's the third day of testimony
in the trial of Dr. Sara Tancredi...

101
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:49,554
...daughter of the late
Governor Frank Tancredi.

102
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:52,384
So far, pundits feel the prosecution
is well on its way...

103
00:09:52,558 --> 00:09:56,221
...to meeting its burden of proof
and getting a conviction on all counts.

104
00:09:56,395 --> 00:09:58,158
Defense counsel, you may proceed.

105
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:02,966
Your Honor, at this time, I ask that
this tape be marked Defense Exhibit D.

106
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:06,536
Objection. Your Honor,
this tape is the very propaganda...

107
00:10:06,706 --> 00:10:10,073
...that Michael Scofield
and Lincoln Burrows released to the media...

108
00:10:10,242 --> 00:10:11,971
...that was summarily debunked.

109
00:10:12,144 --> 00:10:14,874
-The jury still has a right to hear it.
-The tape is hearsay.

110
00:10:15,047 --> 00:10:16,378
Unavailable Witness Exception.

111
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:19,847
The witness is only unavailable
because he's a fugitive on the run.

112
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:24,649
Be that as it may, his statement
on this tape exonerates Dr. Tancredi.

113
00:10:24,824 --> 00:10:26,348
Your Honor....

114
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:28,920
The tape is allowed.

115
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:31,928
The State's objection
will be noted in the record.

116
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:38,804
Much blame has been placed on another
innocent person, Dr. Sara Tancredi.

117
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:41,873
She had nothing to do with our escape.

118
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:46,375
Sara, if you're listening,
I know I can 't ask you for another chance.

119
00:10:46,545 --> 00:10:48,740
I only hope by now,
you 've found your safe haven.

120
00:10:50,082 --> 00:10:53,813
The trial of the late Governor Tancredi's
daughter, Dr. Sara Tancredi...

121
00:10:54,186 --> 00:10:56,279
...continues today in Cook County.

122
00:10:56,455 --> 00:10:59,390
Dr. Tancredi, whose medical license
has been suspended...

123
00:10:59,558 --> 00:11:04,393
...pending the outcome of the trial,
is facing multiple counts, ranging--

124
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:14,957
-I ' m gonna kill him.
-And go back to prison.

125
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:16,362
I don't care.

126
00:12:16,535 --> 00:12:19,902
Once we get the money and he tells me
where Maricruz is I'm gonna kill him.

127
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:23,872
If you find Maricruz, you're gonna
marry Maricruz and live happily ever after.

128
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:26,978
Yeah, after I sink a knife
in Bellick's chest.

129
00:12:27,146 --> 00:12:29,614
Bellick and T-Bag will get theirs,
trust me.

130
00:12:29,782 --> 00:12:31,409
Didn't Fox River teach you anything?

131
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:33,647
Because the same rules apply out here.

132
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:37,318
It doesn't make a difference
if you're guilty or innocent.

133
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:39,890
-It's who survives.
-You're not that guy.

134
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:42,425
That son of a bitch took my girl
and locked her up.

135
00:12:42,628 --> 00:12:44,255
I am that guy now, Michael.

136
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,091
Look at me.

137
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:48,392
Only reason
I'm not five miles away from here...

138
00:12:48,567 --> 00:12:51,559
...is because I wanna help you
find Maricruz, not kill Bellick.

139
00:12:51,737 --> 00:12:55,104
And if that's your game, I'm gone.

140
00:12:59,411 --> 00:13:03,541
Believe me, I understand
the impulse to pull the trigger.

141
00:13:04,216 --> 00:13:06,844
But if we lose ourselves,
we lose everything.

142
00:13:12,858 --> 00:13:14,689
It's been a week.

143
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:18,887
-I don't know where she is. I'm scared.
-We'll find her.

144
00:13:21,867 --> 00:13:23,664
We'll find her.

145
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:45,317
What the hell is this?

146
00:13:55,568 --> 00:14:00,164
Attention, ladies and gentlemen.
The fire alarm has been activated.

147
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:03,934
Please proceed to the nearest exit
in an orderly manner.

148
00:14:18,924 --> 00:14:22,155
You start acting like a cowboy,
this whole thing's going south real fast.

149
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:24,159
Remember that.

150
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,471
Here we go.

151
00:16:13,405 --> 00:16:16,306
You're not gonna like
how this ends, Lincoln.

152
00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:20,839
I'm giving you a chance right now.

153
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,575
Just back away, all right?

154
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:28,310
-Just back away.
-The son of a bitch who killed my dad?

155
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:32,514
You're done.

156
00:17:00,219 --> 00:17:02,710
Those bullet holes don't heal
too good, do they, Mahone?

157
00:17:04,757 --> 00:17:06,987
Toss me the handcuffs.

158
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:11,461
Hand them over, or I swear to God,
I'll blow your head clean off.

159
00:17:37,523 --> 00:17:39,320
Americans?

160
00:17:39,691 --> 00:17:43,286
Oh, thank God. You know
where the Cathedral of Guadalupe is?

161
00:17:43,462 --> 00:17:44,724
Never heard of it.

162
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:46,762
Supposed to meet
my old lady half hour ago.

163
00:17:46,932 --> 00:17:49,628
-That's great.
-They say you can't miss it, but I missed it.

164
00:17:49,802 --> 00:17:52,566
I was wondering if you had
a travel guide or something on you?

165
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:54,433
Why don't you just keep on walking?

166
00:17:55,207 --> 00:17:59,075
Well, excuse me for thinking I could ask for
a little help from some fellow Americans.

167
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:00,836
Hey, listen, beat it.

168
00:18:02,881 --> 00:18:04,246
How we doing, gentlemen?

169
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:10,320
All right, Sucre, the gun.

170
00:18:13,192 --> 00:18:14,819
Come on.

171
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:18,295
Get in the alley.

172
00:19:54,459 --> 00:19:56,256
It is a global problem.

173
00:19:56,495 --> 00:19:59,055
Forty-eight percent
of North American lakes are eutrophic.

174
00:19:59,231 --> 00:20:01,290
-It's 53 percent in Europe--
-Kristine.

175
00:20:01,466 --> 00:20:03,297
-Yeah?
-It's your brother, Paul.

176
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:05,734
What? What's going on?

177
00:20:09,007 --> 00:20:10,668
Hello.

178
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:14,210
He's in this building right here.
We gotta move.

179
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:15,846
Let's see your lD.

180
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,816
Feds?

181
00:20:23,655 --> 00:20:27,284
No. If these guys were,
they'd be after T-Bag. You guys Company?

182
00:20:28,293 --> 00:20:31,126
Come on, Sucre.
Let's wrap these numbnuts up.

183
00:20:37,703 --> 00:20:39,762
What are you guys doing here?
What do you want?

184
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:45,939
I don't like this. Something's up.

185
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:48,737
Come on, Sucre, let's move it.

186
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:57,449
Now. Let's go, come on.

187
00:21:02,494 --> 00:21:04,291
Let's go, Michael.

188
00:21:23,682 --> 00:21:26,014
We know you're in here, Bagwell.

189
00:21:39,531 --> 00:21:41,089
Three to one.

190
00:21:41,266 --> 00:21:43,291
Do the math.

191
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:47,533
Okay, okay. I don't want any trouble.

192
00:21:59,951 --> 00:22:01,816
Slide the gun over.

193
00:22:04,022 --> 00:22:05,717
We can work something out, boys.

194
00:22:06,425 --> 00:22:08,290
Slide the gun over.

195
00:22:20,872 --> 00:22:22,339
Where's the money?

196
00:22:27,145 --> 00:22:28,578
Who called the cops?

197
00:22:31,483 --> 00:22:33,678
You got three seconds, hillbilly. One....

198
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:35,683
In there.

199
00:22:37,255 --> 00:22:38,984
Get it.

200
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:42,351
You want it, you get it.

201
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:44,920
We don't have time for this, Bellick.

202
00:22:45,097 --> 00:22:47,258
Nothing stupid now.

203
00:22:48,066 --> 00:22:50,591
You're not playing games.

204
00:22:50,769 --> 00:22:52,202
Open it.

205
00:22:59,611 --> 00:23:01,476
Sucre, move your ass.

206
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:10,552
Michael.

207
00:23:27,873 --> 00:23:29,397
It's a trap.

208
00:23:54,232 --> 00:23:55,756
Freeze, Bagwell.

209
00:24:02,407 --> 00:24:04,602
Get the money.

210
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:06,377
You want the girl, get the money.

211
00:24:21,326 --> 00:24:23,157
Don't.

212
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:25,953
Don't.

213
00:24:26,264 --> 00:24:28,630
We can work something out.

214
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,931
Move.

215
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:37,508
Sucre, come on.

216
00:24:37,676 --> 00:24:41,737
Theodore Bagwell. He's the one
you want for that dead chick in there.

217
00:24:43,448 --> 00:24:48,476
Anybody speak English? I didn't do it.
I swear to God I didn't do it.

218
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:50,712
Please, please.

219
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:54,520
We can do a little divvying right here.
Then we'll go our separate ways.

220
00:24:54,693 --> 00:24:56,217
Sucre, I want you to get us a car.

221
00:24:56,394 --> 00:24:58,123
What's going on? What's the plan?

222
00:24:58,296 --> 00:24:59,786
I said get us a car.

223
00:25:03,902 --> 00:25:05,699
Looks like you made some friends lately.

224
00:25:06,037 --> 00:25:08,938
-I don't follow.
-That little setup back there.

225
00:25:09,374 --> 00:25:11,239
It's a little out of your league.

226
00:25:11,409 --> 00:25:13,843
Looked almost professional.

227
00:25:14,145 --> 00:25:17,808
Let's say that's the case.
What's it worth to you to find out, huh?

228
00:25:17,983 --> 00:25:21,248
Because I am in possession
of some information...

229
00:25:21,419 --> 00:25:23,284
...that you might need, pretty.

230
00:25:23,455 --> 00:25:27,221
Okay, tell me what you know.
Maybe I'll let you walk.

231
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:28,856
Without the money.

232
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:32,822
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

233
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:36,630
-You're gonna let me traipse on out of here.
-Depends on the information.

234
00:25:37,135 --> 00:25:39,626
Who's pulling your strings?

235
00:25:40,739 --> 00:25:43,902
You know, I got a hunch you're speaking
with a forked tongue, pretty.

236
00:25:44,075 --> 00:25:46,407
So I'm gonna tell you what.
We go someplace public...

237
00:25:46,578 --> 00:25:49,570
...with a car waiting for me
to leave and then....

238
00:25:49,748 --> 00:25:52,216
Then I'll tell you. Deal?

239
00:25:54,352 --> 00:25:55,979
No.

240
00:26:19,177 --> 00:26:21,304
Oh, my God.

241
00:26:24,649 --> 00:26:26,310
Paul.

242
00:26:29,654 --> 00:26:32,953
That is only the second time...

243
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:35,450
...a weapon has ever jammed on me.

244
00:26:36,561 --> 00:26:39,689
First time was during training
for Gulf One.

245
00:26:39,864 --> 00:26:43,027
And as soon as it happened, the C.O.,
he got in my face, and he said:

246
00:26:43,568 --> 00:26:47,265
"Son, a weapon jam on the battlefield.

247
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:50,637
You might as well call that suicide."

248
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:18,095
Kristine, I've...

249
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:22,932
...done things....

250
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:33,212
-Damn.
-I love you, Paul.

251
00:27:33,385 --> 00:27:34,852
Whatever it is that got you here.

252
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:39,222
And there's a way out, believe me.

253
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:47,090
My entire adult life...

254
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:50,191
...I've followed orders.

255
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:52,894
And I did terrible things...

256
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:56,300
...because I thought they were right.

257
00:27:56,808 --> 00:28:01,336
And it turns out I did those things
in the service of nothing.

258
00:28:01,813 --> 00:28:04,611
So that's what I'm left with. Nothing.

259
00:28:06,084 --> 00:28:08,245
You have me.

260
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:11,746
Okay.

261
00:28:14,325 --> 00:28:16,384
And you have a clean slate.

262
00:28:16,728 --> 00:28:19,458
Anything, everything.

263
00:28:19,764 --> 00:28:23,097
-It's available to you starting right now.
-The things I've done, Kristine.

264
00:28:23,268 --> 00:28:25,099
Undo them.

265
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:29,529
Paul, there's always a way.

266
00:28:29,808 --> 00:28:32,368
Maybe that gun jammed for a reason.

267
00:28:35,613 --> 00:28:37,137
Come here.

268
00:28:51,429 --> 00:28:54,398
Don't let your pride
get in the way now, pretty.

269
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:55,999
Save it.

270
00:28:56,167 --> 00:28:58,431
Locking me up
ain't gonna help your situation none.

271
00:28:58,603 --> 00:29:00,969
I have information.

272
00:29:05,143 --> 00:29:08,078
-What's the plan?
-We're gonna take him to the embassy.

273
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:12,446
We're gonna make sure he's deported.
Then we'll go looking for Bellick, all right?

274
00:29:13,618 --> 00:29:16,815
Meanwhile, I want you to ride
in the back with him.

275
00:29:17,188 --> 00:29:20,282
I'm telling you, you are being
penny wise and pound foolish.

276
00:29:20,692 --> 00:29:22,660
Get in the car.

277
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:40,806
Pound foolish,
pound foolish, pound foolish.

278
00:29:42,347 --> 00:29:44,907
I'll tell her about the offer.

279
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:49,447
-Well?
-Twelve years.

280
00:29:51,322 --> 00:29:53,847
No, no, the jury heard
Michael's statement.

281
00:29:54,025 --> 00:29:57,324
They heard a convicted felon lie
for a woman that he clearly cares for.

282
00:29:57,495 --> 00:29:59,520
He's got no credibility.

283
00:29:59,697 --> 00:30:02,427
Sara, we need to take a hard look
at what they're offering.

284
00:30:03,268 --> 00:30:05,998
Due respect, Marty,
we aren't going to prison, I am.

285
00:30:06,171 --> 00:30:08,969
They've made it clear that they want
somebody to hang for this...

286
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:12,337
...and unfortunately, you're the only one
they've got in their grasp.

287
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:13,738
There's no avoiding it.

288
00:30:16,281 --> 00:30:19,614
This is the plea agreement.
We can walk you through it if you'd like.

289
00:30:21,853 --> 00:30:23,946
Twelve years?

290
00:30:29,227 --> 00:30:30,888
He ain't answering.

291
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:33,892
I certainly hope your brother
makes it back to that boat.

292
00:30:35,967 --> 00:30:37,867
And if he doesn't?

293
00:30:38,269 --> 00:30:39,930
You should see yourself.

294
00:30:40,104 --> 00:30:42,834
You look like you're hanging in there
by a thread.

295
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:47,139
I just want this over with.

296
00:30:47,812 --> 00:30:49,973
Then you should never have
come down here.

297
00:30:52,884 --> 00:30:56,376
In case you hadn't noticed,
me and my brother don't quit for no one.

298
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:59,251
Thank God for that.

299
00:30:59,557 --> 00:31:04,859
Because it's guys accused of things like you
were that keep guys like me in business.

300
00:31:07,265 --> 00:31:12,396
Kept guys like me in business, rather.

301
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:14,732
It's gonna end bad for you, man.

302
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:20,334
A couple of things in this world
I'm good at.

303
00:31:20,612 --> 00:31:24,378
One of them is looking into a man's eye
and knowing when he's beat.

304
00:31:32,957 --> 00:31:35,858
-How far to the embassy?
-Just hang in there, buddy.

305
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:39,459
-And then what?
-We're gonna turn him in.

306
00:31:39,631 --> 00:31:42,657
-And how do we not get busted?
-Before we get there, I'll pull over.

307
00:31:42,834 --> 00:31:46,235
We'll hogtie him with duct tape,
then we'll dump him out and hit the road...

308
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:49,134
...and I'll call the cops,
tell them where we left him.

309
00:31:49,307 --> 00:31:51,775
-How do we get to Bellick?
-Don't worry, we'll find him.

310
00:31:51,943 --> 00:31:56,004
-Y'all ain't getting within a mile of Bellick.
-Nobody asked you.

311
00:31:57,382 --> 00:31:58,872
He's got a point though, Michael.

312
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:00,745
Just keep the gun on him, okay?

313
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:04,252
I mean, if Bellick's locked up,
what good's the money gonna be to him?

314
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:06,617
-We'll fix it.
-My girl's life's on the line here.

315
00:32:06,791 --> 00:32:09,259
-Sucre, you better pull it together--
-Oh, God.

316
00:32:48,433 --> 00:32:50,458
Maricruz.

317
00:32:52,704 --> 00:32:54,865
Easy, easy.

318
00:32:55,573 --> 00:32:58,701
-Maricruz, Maricruz.
-You're gonna be all right.

319
00:33:17,428 --> 00:33:20,261
Go get the money, please.

320
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:31,899
Pressure. Pressure.

321
00:34:51,689 --> 00:34:53,953
What exactly is it that you want, pretty?

322
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:05,796
I'm turning you in.

323
00:35:07,405 --> 00:35:09,873
Is that it, really?

324
00:35:10,041 --> 00:35:14,410
It ain't about the money?
Because if it is, you can tell me.

325
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:16,479
Ain't nobody here but us cons.

326
00:35:16,647 --> 00:35:20,777
You can walk or get dragged...

327
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:22,476
...but it's up to you.

328
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:28,289
No, see, when you had the gun on me,
I afforded you a certain respect.

329
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:32,793
But here, well,
the scales are tipped back my way.

330
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:36,422
So I'm gonna spell out
the present options.

331
00:35:36,601 --> 00:35:39,263
Either we split this money...

332
00:35:39,437 --> 00:35:44,136
...and you can go get your legs tattooed,
or whatever the hell it is that you want.

333
00:35:44,342 --> 00:35:46,810
Or they're gonna find your corpse
over that chair...

334
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:51,415
...with your pants down around your ankles
because it's been a long time coming.

335
00:36:01,092 --> 00:36:02,992
Well, I got my answer.

336
00:36:04,929 --> 00:36:07,397
Whenever you're done yakking.

337
00:36:09,567 --> 00:36:11,831
Bring it, bitch.

338
00:36:37,895 --> 00:36:40,363
Who are you fooling?

339
00:36:40,565 --> 00:36:44,023
You ain't gonna kill me,
Mr. Michelangelo.

340
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:47,933
You ain't got it in you.
So why don't we just let me--

341
00:36:58,616 --> 00:37:00,174
All right.

342
00:37:10,428 --> 00:37:12,487
Okay, Sara.

343
00:37:13,097 --> 00:37:15,622
Now, here's how the plea
is going to go down.

344
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,530
The judge is gonna need you
to allocute to the charges.

345
00:37:18,703 --> 00:37:22,230
He's gonna ask you
if you intentionally left the door open.

346
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:24,169
-You will say yes.
-Right.

347
00:37:24,342 --> 00:37:26,037
And then he's gonna ask you:

348
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:29,543
"Did you give support and comfort
to Michael Scofield and Lincoln Burrows...

349
00:37:29,714 --> 00:37:32,774
...since the escape? " You'll say yes.

350
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:35,646
And then the sentence
will be immediately handed down.

351
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:38,488
The prosecution is asking
that you do your time...

352
00:37:38,656 --> 00:37:40,954
...in a maximum security facility.

353
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:46,527
I think the judge
is going to agree to that.

354
00:37:48,633 --> 00:37:50,260
Okay.

355
00:37:53,037 --> 00:37:54,971
With good behavior...

356
00:37:55,139 --> 00:37:57,937
...how many years of my sentence
can I expect to serve?

357
00:37:58,309 --> 00:38:00,800
On a 1 2-year sentence...

358
00:38:01,812 --> 00:38:04,246
...you'll do nine years.

359
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:09,276
I'll be out before I'm 40.

360
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:10,848
I'm sorry, Sara.

361
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:15,954
Sara, are you ready for this?

362
00:38:17,728 --> 00:38:18,956
What?

363
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:21,462
A very credible witness
has just come forward...

364
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:22,997
...and he's willing to testify.

365
00:38:23,167 --> 00:38:25,965
He'll corroborate everything you've said
about this conspiracy.

366
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:27,570
Who?

367
00:39:24,328 --> 00:39:25,818
Linc?

368
00:39:39,977 --> 00:39:41,740
Linc?

369
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:57,691
-Do you speak English?
-Si, señor. Yes, I do.

370
00:39:57,862 --> 00:40:02,925
Good, good. I need to get in contact
with every hospital in the Panama City area.

371
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:05,364
A friend of mine was....

372
00:40:05,536 --> 00:40:07,629
A friend of mine was in a car accident.

373
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:10,267
Sir?

374
00:40:10,441 --> 00:40:12,534
I'm sorry,
I'm gonna have to call you back.

375
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:14,442
Linc?

376
00:40:15,179 --> 00:40:17,773
-I'm sorry, Michael.
-What's wrong?

377
00:40:22,686 --> 00:40:24,085
Hello, Michael.

378
00:40:25,456 --> 00:40:27,583
If you touch my brother,
you're a dead man.

379
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:29,157
Oh, please.

380
00:40:29,326 --> 00:40:31,419
You don't have to worry about that.

381
00:40:33,697 --> 00:40:35,961
But when it comes right down to it...

382
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:39,395
...he's just like you.

383
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:42,834
He has a heart that won't kill a man.

384
00:40:44,875 --> 00:40:50,142
Give me the handcuffs, or I swear to God,
I'll blow your head clean off.

385
00:41:14,238 --> 00:41:15,796
What do you want, Alex?

386
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:19,966
I'll tell you exactly what I want.
But first things first.

387
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:23,204
When the authorities
captured Bagwell today...

388
00:41:23,714 --> 00:41:27,377
...the money was nowhere to be found.

389
00:41:28,219 --> 00:41:30,983
Now, I can only assume...

390
00:41:31,388 --> 00:41:33,515
...that you've got the money...

391
00:41:34,959 --> 00:41:38,224
...aboard the Christina Rose right now.

392
00:41:38,395 --> 00:41:41,728
It's an amazing plan. Take the money,
take the boat and disappear forever.

393
00:41:43,534 --> 00:41:48,836
But you are not the only one
that needs to disappear.

394
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:51,941
-Are you still there?
-Yeah, I'm still here.

395
00:41:52,109 --> 00:41:55,601
Good. Because I'm gonna say this
and I'm gonna say this once:

396
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:58,414
Bring me the money, bring me the boat.

397
00:42:00,284 --> 00:42:01,876
You are out of your mind.

398
00:42:02,052 --> 00:42:03,451
Not really.

399
00:42:03,621 --> 00:42:05,816
We both have something
the other person needs.

400
00:42:06,657 --> 00:42:08,557
It all comes down to this, Michael:

401
00:42:08,893 --> 00:42:12,056
Your brother for your plan.

402
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:16,422
Five minutes. That's what you have.

403
00:42:59,209 --> 00:43:01,200
