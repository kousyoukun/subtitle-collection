1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:02,130
Previously on prison break:

2
00:00:02,470 --> 00:00:05,080
Listen,why don't I just give you half
the money we call it a day?

3
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:07,330
All right,60/40.

4
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:09,510
You thieving son of a bitch.

5
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:12,620
You better get down on your knees and pray to god that I don't find you.

6
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:17,000
Because if I do,mark my words, I'm gonna gut you bow to stern.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,660
- Mr. Bellick? - Yeah?

8
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:20,790
Do you mind answering a few more questions?

9
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:23,740
We have a lead as to where burroughs will be meeting up with his brother.

10
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:26,010
It's a place he referred to as "bolshoi booze.¡±

11
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:27,040
They're numbers.

12
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:30,630
Plug 'em into your gps they'll take you to a spot in the new mexico desert.

13
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:34,440
- Daddy! - Hey,baby,you ready to go?

14
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:36,810
Go,go,go,go,go!

15
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:39,570
What do we do now?

16
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:45,740
- she told you anything? - Not yet.

17
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:48,120
- Then kill her. - Well,she knows something.

18
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,570
You disobey me,you are done! Put her in the ground,paul!

19
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:55,900
You're going to die,and all you had to do was tell me what your father gave you.

20
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:57,880
Go to hell.

21
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:01,910
Go!

22
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:05,740
The plane's gonna stop at the seven-mile marker,

23
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:08,020
route 4 at sunset.

24
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:09,960
- We got to go. - I brought someone.

25
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,400
Dad?

26
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:14,560
We met before.

27
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:20,390
It was you.

28
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:22,200
Go easy,son.

29
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:24,590
Stay away from me.

30
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,900
- What the hell's going on? - I know him.

31
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:28,600
What do you mean you know him? That's impossible.

32
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,500
I know him. I know this man!

33
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,930
- Michael... - Maybe that's far enough.

34
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:43,390
This doesn't concern you.

35
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:45,130
What the hell's going on,dad?

36
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:52,610
After mom died...

37
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:55,480
you were in juvie.

38
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,920
They put me with this...

39
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:03,000
this foster father down on pershing avenue.

40
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:07,530
He punished me,

41
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:10,340
locked me up.

42
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,920
If you leave someone alone in the dark for that long,

43
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,990
their eyes start to adjust.

44
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:22,000
You start to see things,no matter how small,

45
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:27,980
because if they exist,they can help you.

46
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:33,430
help you do the only thing you want to do...

47
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:36,180
when you're alone in the dark:

48
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:39,070
Get out.

49
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:11,320
I've used just about every lure that you could use.

50
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:14,280
Most of them,you need to be an expert to use.

51
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,240
This moto lure's a little different.

52
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,830
Everybody,I mean everybody,can fish with it.

53
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:22,250
And you're gonna catch bigger fish, you're gonna catch more fish.

54
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:26,600
it even works in weedy areas where most top-water lures won't work.

55
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:29,090
Take a look at this baby.

56
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:31,000
This thing looks like a real minnow.

57
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,050
This is one very cool bait.

58
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:35,830
I have never sn anything quite like this.

59
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:39,560
even if you've bought lures off of tv in the past and been disappointed--

60
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,620
and believe me,I know how you feel--

61
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,100
- hey. - Sorry,man.I thought you'd left.

62
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,100
No,still here. Here I am.

63
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:49,990
Yeah,it's just that a couple of guests are complaining about the volume of your tv.

64
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:52,530
Oh,sorry,I fell asleep.

65
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:55,230
I must have hit the remote. I'll take care of it.

66
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:56,750
Thanks.Sorry. Thanks.Great.

67
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:02,110
Um,so could you do that for me now, please,so it's taken care of?

68
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:03,840
Yeah. Thanks.

69
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:16,380
taken care of .

70
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:21,580
is,uh,everything okay in your bathroom?

71
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:24,110
Excuse me?

72
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,580
Your bathroom. There's a noise coming from it.

73
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:29,110
Yeah,my daughter thinks bath time is playtime.

74
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:32,960
I will clean it up. Scout's honor.Sorry.

75
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,570
All right. Have a nice day.

76
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:38,420
Yeah,you,too.

77
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:50,710
- Michael, - Michael?

78
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:52,670
- michael,please wait. - He did this to you?

79
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:54,560
- Michael! - Lincoln!

80
00:04:57,210 --> 00:04:58,860
He did this to you?

81
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:02,920
He did this to you?

82
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:10,670
Michael!

83
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:16,090
How could you do that to another human being with your own hands?

84
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:29,930
it's okay. You're safe now.

85
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:37,430
He's not going to hurt you anymore.

86
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,190
Come on.

87
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:51,050
Come with me and don't look back.

88
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:04,200
Michael!

89
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:07,440
Michael...

90
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:17,180
it's gonna be all right.

91
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:13,890
Six months I was in that place.

92
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,460
Where were you?

93
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:18,900
How long did you know?

94
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:21,650
I found you as soon as I could. The state kept moving you around.

95
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:23,130
Then you went away again,right?

96
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:25,560
You don't think it killed me to leave you like that?

97
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,250
To leave in the first place?

98
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:30,390
Since the beginning,I was the problem. Since day one.

99
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:32,460
Your lives are what they are because of me.

100
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:34,340
Yes,linc told me about the company.

101
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:37,760
Apparently,you were some kind of analyst. That's the job you chose over your family.

102
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,560
I thought I was doing the right thing. I thought I was protecting you.

103
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,330
From what,dad,from who?

104
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,250
The company had enemies! I was important to the company.

105
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:50,170
I became a target. Easiest way to get to me would be to get to you!

106
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:53,880
I left as soon as I realized how corrupt it all was. How they were buying the government...

107
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,840
- you could have come back at any time! - No,I couldn't!

108
00:09:57,460 --> 00:10:02,000
Michael,turning on the company put me and you at even greater risk.

109
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:04,580
I had to stay away.

110
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,530
We were your sons.

111
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:09,960
And you still are,michael.

112
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,900
We can fix this.

113
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:14,960
I came back so that we could fix this.

114
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:18,700
This can never be fixed.

115
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:24,420
There's a tape.

116
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,230
Gives us everything we need.

117
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:30,980
Linc will be set free if we find it.

118
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:34,080
You're not gonna believe who he thinks has it.

119
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:36,200
Who?

120
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,620
Sara.

121
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:46,050
Yes,uh,tall and slender, brown hair,brown eyes.

122
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,330
She'd be pretty banged up.

123
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:51,550
No one matching that description has been brought into the er.

124
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:58,040
Kellerman.

125
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:00,060
No report on sara tancredi?

126
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:02,350
She's dead. I'm dealing with the body right now.

127
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,150
You must be relieved that it's over.

128
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:07,730
Yeah. Yeah,I got to go.

129
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:10,870
One more thing: Confirmation.

130
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,910
I need a photo of the body before disposal.

131
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:16,160
Uh,take one with your phone and send it to me and I'll...

132
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,470
bill not a good time right now,all right?

133
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:24,930
Paul,take a breath,then take the picture.

134
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,910
I'm waiting.

135
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:40,390
"the trail led to a very dangerous place. (HARVEY.NORTH DAKOTA)

136
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,230
"Now,arvid knew that,"

137
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:44,680
but he held tightly onto the dragon's leash anyway,

138
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:49,010
"as the creature ran into the everdark forest, pulling the young boy behind him.¡±

139
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:52,130
Why didn't he just let go of the leash?

140
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:55,060
Well,because he loved the dragon.

141
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:59,440
Now,when you love someone,you'll do anything to hold onto them.

142
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:03,750
Anything to keep them safe and happy.

143
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:06,050
Is that why we're camping?

144
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:09,610
Yep. So we can all be together.

145
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,200
I'm happy.

146
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:16,750
I'm happy,too.

147
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:25,680
Here you go.

148
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:41,370
Well,it's all working out,huh?

149
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:43,540
Don't say that.

150
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:59,700
You know,this moment,right here,right now,

151
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,370
it's all worth it.

152
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,760
I love you.

153
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,760
I love you,too.

That's old.

156
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:40,210
The kids are bigger now.

157
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:41,570
Sorry. I was just...

158
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:44,480
getting bored out of your wits 'cause you been waiting so long.

159
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:47,420
Really sorry about all this.

160

We don't get a whole bunch of homicides out here, and,well,we're trying to play catch-up.

00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:53,330
Please,have a seat.

00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:02,820
Ain't that the truth?

165
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,760
So you guys out here in kansas together?

166
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,150
Yeah. That's right.

167
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,750
Doing what?

168
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,030
Well,you know,just seeing the sights.

169
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:13,600
You left chicago to see the sights in tribune,kansas?

170
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,100
Last time I checked,a man could go where he wanted.

171
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,480
Mr. Bellick...

172
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,110
brad.

173
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:21,360
Brad.

174
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:23,800
I don't really care what you were doing out here.

175
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:28,000
We're both in law enforcement. We can each sniff out a perp like a hot fart.

176
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,460
Pardon my french.

177
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:34,080
we both know you're not a criminal,so...

178
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,220
I don't care if you boys were out here whoopin' it without your wives or...

179
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:41,910
going brokeback.

180
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:43,280
What?

181
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,800
Hell,no.

182
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,530
My point is,I don't care what you were doing.

183
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:50,980
I just need to know where you were doing it and who you might have crossed paths with so

184
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:53,630
I can find out who carved up Mr. Geary.

185
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:04,010
Geary and I got a lead that one of the fox river eight was in town.

186
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:07,390
Which one?

187
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,470
Theodore bagwell.

188
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:11,700
The man who did all those horrible things to those teenagers?

189
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:12,810
That's him.

190
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:16,120
We were going to bring him in for the reward money, but we couldn't get a handle on him.

191
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,930
Geary and I split up, figured we didn't have a shot,but...

192
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:19,980
but what?

193
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:25,470
Well,after what happened,I'm starting to think maybe geary ran into ol' bagwell after all.

194
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,450
Right here in tribune?

195
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:32,400
Now,brad,do you think you could answer some questions

196
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:35,450
that might help us track theodore bagwell?

197
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,540
I'd be indebted.

198
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:40,610
I'll do whatever I can to help you nail that son of a bitch.

199
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:43,130
You think sara has this tape?

200
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:44,850
Government does.

201
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:50,680
I just saw her yesterday. If she does have anything,she doesn't know.

202
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:52,730
Well,where is she now?

203
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:54,520
I don't know.

204
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,240
Any way you can get in touch with her?

205
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,660
We brought cell phones. I could call her.

206
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:01,390
Please,please,please,bro, call her from panama.

207
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:02,690
Please.

208
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:05,930
We got less than two hours. I got to make the flight.

209
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:11,390
What?

210
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,420
Run. Run!

211
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:26,130
where's this car you keep talking about?

212
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:28,140
- It's over the ridge. - Give me that.

213
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:31,150
You guys head for the car! Go!

214
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:41,050
Come on!

215
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:50,890
Go!

216
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:53,290
Go back for him!

217
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,170
Dad! Go!

218
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:01,950
Come on,dad

219
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,400
We made it!

220
00:17:12,610 --> 00:17:14,410
Son of a bitch! We made it!

221
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:22,700
Linc.

222
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,690
Sucre,get us to a hospital.

223
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:37,220
Out here? Where the hell am I going to find...?

224
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:39,230
Just get us to a hospital,please!

225
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:40,490
Okay.

226
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:42,040
Don't worry. You're going to make it.

227
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:44,350
It's bile.

228
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:46,230
He got me clean through.

229
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:47,920
You're going to be okay! Just...

230
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,470
hold on.

231
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:51,810
Listen to me,both of you.

232
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:55,570
I'm sorry.

233
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,990
I wish I had never left.

234
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:02,820
Don't talk,don't talk. Just breathe.

235
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:11,090
Okay,so do you want a pb & b?

236
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:14,240
Not really. My tummy hurts.

237
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:18,650
Where's her knapsack?

238
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:20,460
Her what?

239
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:23,090
Knapsack. Her medicine's in it.

240
00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:25,280
I don't know,baby. I just grabbed her and ran.

241
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,320
She needs that medicine. She can't go two days without it.

242
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:30,680
Yeah,I know. I'm her father,all right?

243
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,210
Where is it?

244
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:35,240
Baby.Baby,look. Calm down.

245
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,190
What are you looking for?

246
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:38,640
Just tell me what it is,and I'll go ahead and get it,okay?

247
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,300
Her prescription.

248
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:44,470
It's a backup. I keep an extra,in case.

249
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:46,810
Okay. Okay.

250
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:52,310
so all we need to do is find a pharmacy.

251
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:58,150
Don't worry.

252
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:01,180
Hey,looks like we're going on a ride, sweet pea.

253
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:06,550
Look,we nail bagwell,he might still have some of geary's things on him,like his backpack,

254
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:09,660
which has his personal stuff in it. I know his wife would love to have it.

255
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:13,190
If we find bagwell,you can give it to her personally.

256
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:13,990
Thanks.

257
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:16,500
It's the least I can do considering ho you're helping me out.

258
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:19,900
Though some of the guys on the force are concerned about...

259
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,680
what are they concerned about?

260
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,650
Nothing.

261
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:25,470
But you know what?

262
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:27,650
Why don't you tell me what you know, we'll track down bagwell,

263
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:30,980
we'll get geary's effects back to his family, I'll make sure that everybody involved knows that

264
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:32,850
your help was invaluable.

265
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:36,820
I'll even recommend that you get most of, if not all of,that reward money.

266
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:41,000
What is it exactly that the guys on the force were concerned about?

267
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:47,130
Well,some of them thought that you weren't being totally upfront about your head injury.

268
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:50,160
I mean,to be fair,it does seem a little off

269
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,430
that you didn't see the guy who hit you smack-dab on the forehead.

270
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:59,550
You got me.

271
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:05,360
Geary and me had a little dustup over how to go about finding bagwell.

272
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,290
It got physical,and he hit me.

273
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:12,340
The two of us,we fought like brothers. I didn't want to rat him out to the cops.

274
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:16,330
After the fight,we split up.

275
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:18,980
And then...

276
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:23,830
Well,you know what happened to him.

277
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:27,960
I just wish to hell we'd never fought, you know?

278
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,090
Maybe then he'd still be...

279
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,120
brad,you can't blame yourself.

280
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:41,420
Why don't we refocus our energy on finng the man who killed your friend?

281
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,910
That's what roy would've wanted.

282
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,960
All right,baby.

283
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,170
Insurance card?

284
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:13,740
Uh,no,I don't have insurance.

285
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:16,450
You're paying for dexamethasone without insurance?

286
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,580
You got medicaid,medicare or something?

287
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:23,240
Nope. Um,I'll just pay cash.

288
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:25,560
It's $125.

289
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:38,750
Excuse me?

290
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:41,810
Excuse me?

291
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:45,640
Um,oh,sorry.

292
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:57,640
Sorry I don't have anything smaller.

293
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,090
I have to go to the back   to get change for $100.

294
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:04,290
So... I'll be right back.

295
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,260
- Right there! Hospital!    - I see it.

296
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:19,860
I see it. Just get us there.

297
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:21,060
No,you'll be caught.

298
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:22,810
Then we'll be caught.

299
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,910
I'm not gonna let you die.

300
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,420
Then listen to me.

301
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:30,040
You find sara tancredi.

302
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,090
She can end this.

303
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:37,240
It's up to you now.

304
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:49,970
yeah,I want an alarm out   on a dark blue sedan.

305
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:52,380
License: Ae9268.

306
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:55,150
40 miles southeast of los cruces.

307
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,230
Do it now.

308
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,670
oh,come on!

309
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:05,000
What?

310
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:08,480
What hospital?

311
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:12,300
CARLSBAD.NEW MEXICO    ST.DE LORENZO HOSPITAL

312
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:14,270
He came in with a bad gsw.

313
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:17,010
Docs called us in. He's in here.

314
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:19,510
We ran his name.

315
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:22,680
Came back with two federal drug   smuggling warrants out on him.

316
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,370
Heard you wanted to talk to me.

317
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:32,720
I got some information the feds want...

318
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:36,200
about michael scofield.

319
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:42,040
Like where he's catching a ride.

320
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:44,400
And where would that be?

321
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:49,440
It's not just the where but the when.

322
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:53,070
That when is coming up soon.

323
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,990
But I want to cut a deal first.

324
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:01,720
Give us a minute.

325
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:14,190
Anything you want to say?

326
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:19,500
One daY. That's all we had.

327
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:45,730
Back then,

328
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,380
when things were at their worst...

329
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:53,170
there were days I thought   I'd never see the sun again.

330
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:56,240
But he saved my life.

331
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,560
I just wish he could have   let us be a part of his.

332
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:11,350
Yeah.

333
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,730
I'll tell him.

334
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:28,370
Here's the deal.

335
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:32,960
All charges dropped and the government picks up   medical costs until you're fit to be deported,

336
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:35,980
all contingent upon your   information being accurate.

337
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:39,990
Where's scofield?

338
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:43,920
No deportation. I want citizenship.

339
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,520
Citizenship?

340
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:50,880
A little incentive,and I want it in writing.

341
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:53,740
I'm so tired of playing games.

342
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:56,310
Well,start typing.

343
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:04,510
No external pacemaker.

344
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:08,510
Oh,this is a good one--   no morphine drip.

345
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:09,810
What are you doing?

346
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:11,930
Fbi. Out. Out!

347
00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:14,380
What the hell are you doing?

348
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:16,450
Giving you a little incentive.

349
00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:19,620
Come on! Come on,you son of A...

350
00:26:19,930 --> 00:26:21,430
And they found nothing?

351
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:23,750
Okay,thanks.

352
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:26,440
Well,your instincts are great,brad,

353
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:29,040
but the precinct actually sent a   unit over to hollander's house today.

354
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:32,430
An anonymous caller said they saw   an intruder but no one was there.

355
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:34,090
Damn it.

356
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:38,240
If you knew about bagwell and hollander,why   didn't you just head over there yourself?

357
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:41,420
We couldn't find the house.

358
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,810
Really? It's listed.

359
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:52,720
excuse me.

360
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,890
Thank you.

361
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:05,000
Everything okay?

362
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:08,120
Yeah,yeah,everything's fine.

363
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:13,500
Brad,have you ever been to the fauntleroy   hotel? It's about 15 minutes from here.

364
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:14,940
Never heard of it.

365
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:16,950
Well,that's strange,

366
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,830
'cause they found this   receipt in geary's hotel room.

367
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,370
It's from your credit card.

368
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:23,920
THANK YOU FOR SHOPPING WITH US

369
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:27,060
I don't know how that got there.

370
00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:33,930
I think you're being evasive.

371
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:37,120
You should tell me   the truth,mr.Bellick.

372
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:38,940
What happened to "brad"?

373
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:42,270
About seven years ago,I   got my first homicide case

374
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:44,810
a woman,pretty.   She was brutally attacked.

375
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:47,060
Animal boyfriend left her for dead,

376
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:49,590
but she was still breathing... barely.

377
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:53,610
But she punched into her cell   phone the killer's number,

378
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:56,190
so she solved the crime for us.

379
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:58,770
When we found the receipt,brad,

380
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:01,440
it was in geary's hand,his   finger pointing to your name.

381
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:03,870
With his last ounce of strength, he told us you killed him.

382
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,110
Okay,listen.

383
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:08,120
Geary and I found bagwell   at hollander's house.

384
00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:13,440
We roughed him up till he told us where he'd hid   the five million bucks we knew he dug up in utah.

385
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:16,230
When we found the money, geary double-crossed me.

386
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,490
He hit me in the   head and took the cash.

387
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,160
I had nothing to do   with geary's death.

388
00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:21,480
You hear what I'm saying?

389
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:25,140
I'm the victim here, not that son of a bitch!

390
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:37,420
Come on,come on,come on.

391
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:39,800
Where are you at,baby?

392
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:47,490
Hey,uh,could you hurry it up?

393
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:50,360
It's just it's getting really   late-- I got to get home.

394
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:00,180
And,um,that's $20,$40,

395
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:03,220
$50,and $20 is $70.

396
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:05,940
One,two,three,four...

397
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,760
five...

398
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:09,250
seventy-five.

399
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:25,390
You got to be kidding me.

400
00:29:35,170 --> 00:29:36,430
Ma'am.

401
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,110
Afternoon,officer.

402
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:42,420
Do you have any id with you?

403
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,190
no.I walked over here,

404
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,890
so i didn't carry anything with me.

405
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:49,260
Did you? Where'd you walk from?

406
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,580
Is there a problem,officer?

407
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:55,060
There's only a problem if   you make one,ms. Franklin.

408
00:29:55,950 --> 00:29:57,900
You want to tell us   where your husband is?

409
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:02,000
I don't know.

410
00:30:02,490 --> 00:30:05,010
Place your hands behind   your back,please,ma'am.

411
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:18,110
Baby,I'm so sorry.

412
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,130
Oh,my god.

413
00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:39,400
Where's mommy?

414
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:45,960
Mommy,uh,mommy is going   to meet us later. Okay?

415
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:54,510
- Yes.    - Where's the photo?

416
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:57,170
Bill,there was a tactical error.

417
00:30:57,180 --> 00:31:00,380
I don't want terminology from the   cover your ass handbook,paul.

418
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:02,160
What happened?

419
00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:05,510
There were unforeseen circumstances, things that could not be predicted.

420
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,240
Where's sara?

421
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:11,410
She's gone,isn't she?

422
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:17,390
Yes,she got away,

423
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:20,130
but there's no way that she could...

424
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:22,240
bill.

425
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,860
I'm not going to let you die.

426
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:41,510
I love you.

427
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:46,190
You know that,don't you?

428
00:33:01,050 --> 00:33:02,700
Too many.

429
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:07,510
Too many people died because   I wanted you to be free.

430
00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:10,430
You couldn't have known,michael.

431
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:13,860
You couldn't have know it...   would have ended up like this.

432
00:33:13,870 --> 00:33:15,790
But it did.

433
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:20,210
They wanted him.

434
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,780
They wanted him in the ground,

435
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,720
and they got their wish.

436
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:29,270
This thing is not going   to end here,michael.

437
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:34,030
- I know.    - It's going to keep spreading.

438
00:33:36,130 --> 00:33:39,170
Their hands are going to   get more and more bloody.

439
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,380
Well,the question is,

440
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:45,700
is the blood on their   hands... or ours?

441
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:53,910
I'm sorry,guys.

442
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:56,370
We got to go.

443
00:34:15,490 --> 00:34:16,690
Get back on with border patrol.

444
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:18,920
Call the navy reserve   air station in dallas.

445
00:34:18,930 --> 00:34:20,130
They've got planes on alert.

446
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:24,580
We need an intercept of a white,single   engine a-36 beech heading toward the border.

447
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:27,450
Call mexico,get clearance   for an international pursuit.

448
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:30,530
Tell them if they got to take   the plane down,just do it.

449
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:16,290
Come on,guys!

450
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:19,160
Guys,come on.

451
00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:20,570
Come on,guys.

452
00:35:23,410 --> 00:35:25,050
What?

453
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:28,870
We're staying.

454
00:35:29,470 --> 00:35:31,960
- Ay,vamonos!    - Esperate,esperate,esperate.

455
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:37,470
Michael,this is what   we've been waiting for.

456
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:40,150
Maybe we'll see you   down there somewhere.

457
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:43,650
I can't talk you out   of this one,can i?

458
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:53,480
Well,I hope so.

459
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,370
Be good.

460
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:57,210
Thank you,michael.

461
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:59,040
Thank you for everything.

462
00:36:05,050 --> 00:36:07,650
- Take care,all right?     - I will.

463
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,030
Fly safe,papi.

464
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:14,760
Give 'em hell.

465
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:34,140
Panama would've been good.

466
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:35,720
Are you ready for this?

467
00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:38,510
- Been waiting years.    - Good to hear it.

468
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,280
'Cause today is the   day we stop running.

469
00:36:55,170 --> 00:36:57,330
- What now?     - We go back to the car.

470
00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:00,080
I drive to a border town, find a cell phone signal.

471
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:02,170
Call sara.

472
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,560
Where the hell are those jets?

473
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:28,870
you hear that?

474
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,320
Yeah.

475
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:34,500
Pull over.

476
00:37:47,110 --> 00:37:48,900
oh,god,they're going after sucre.

477
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:51,900
They're gonna take him down.

478
00:37:52,530 --> 00:37:55,130
- How'd they find out?    - I don't know.

479
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:01,420
Michael.

480
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,620
I want to know what   the hell's going on.

481
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:36,030
If you could've arrested me, you would've already done it.

482
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:36,790
I'm out of here.

483
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,660
Not really an option   for you,mr. Bellick.

484
00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:41,930
What do you got,a receipt? He left   it in his pocket. A fight? Big deal.

485
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:45,770
I got ten pals in chicago tell you   geary and i threw down once a month.

486
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:46,810
You're right.

487
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:49,550
Any of those things on their   own,probably not enough.

488
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,350
But when you add this...

489
00:38:51,690 --> 00:38:53,450
what the hell's that?

490
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:56,130
You left a message for mr. Geary.

491
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:59,520
You thieving son of a bitch,

492
00:38:59,530 --> 00:39:02,630
you better get down on your knees   and pray to god that I don't find you.

493
00:39:02,810 --> 00:39:04,880
Because if I do,mark my words:

494
00:39:04,890 --> 00:39:07,440
I'm gonna gut you bow to stern.

495
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:12,600
You want to hear it again?

496
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:19,710
Now at this juncture,brad,things will go a whole   lot easier for you if you admit to the crime.

497
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:21,110
Now you listen to me,

498
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:23,990
you manipulative little bitch.

499
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,220
I did not kill roy geary!

500
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:27,750
You understand what I'm telling you!

501
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,580
Bagwell set me up!

502
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:30,990
Get your hds off of me!

503
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,570
Bradley bellick,you are under arrest for the   first-degree murder of roy william geary.

504
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:35,650
You have a right to remain silent.

505
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:38,040
Anything you say can be used   against you in a court of law.

506
00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:41,050
You have a right to talk with an attorney and to  have him present with you when being questioned.

507
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:43,000
If you cannot hire an attorney...

508
00:39:54,150 --> 00:39:55,510
President reynolds' office.

509
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:56,910
This is agent paul kellerman.

510
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:59,610
I need to speak with the   president right now,please.

511
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:02,980
I'm sorry,this administration isn't   familiar with an agent kellerman.

512
00:40:02,990 --> 00:40:04,560
June,it's me.

513
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:07,450
I need to speak with caroline now.

514
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:09,410
June,if you don't put me through,

515
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:10,740
I'll make certain that the  president knows that

516
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:14,780
you were the one who did not allow me to  provide her with some very important information.

517
00:40:14,790 --> 00:40:16,340
Now.

518
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:20,510
I'm sorry,this administration   isn't familiar with an agent...

519
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:35,860
Please leave a message after the tone.

520
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:37,820
bill,don't do thiS.

521
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:41,510
I've dedicated my life to   this country,to caroline.

522
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,590
Everything I have,I give.

523
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:47,260
Every photo,every file.   Get rid of it all.

524
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,990
Make him a ghost.

525
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,560
I've been a perfect soldier.

526
00:40:50,570 --> 00:40:53,210
I've never asked   anything of you,ever.

527
00:40:53,730 --> 00:40:55,680
But I'm asking now.

528
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:58,420
Bill,don't do thiS.

529
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:05,100
I don't see him.

530
00:41:05,110 --> 00:41:08,400
Trust me,we haven't lost him yet.

531
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:10,590
No Service..

532
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:15,590
Connecting.. No Service..

533
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:17,930
Linc?

534
00:41:18,450 --> 00:41:20,450
- Stop the car.    - What?

535
00:41:20,530 --> 00:41:22,680
We got to stop the car.

536
00:41:28,650 --> 00:41:30,460
That's a radio tower over there.

537
00:41:30,470 --> 00:41:33,240
It must be picking up some   kind of analog signal.

538
00:41:33,850 --> 00:41:35,220
We got to get closer.

539
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:37,110
Turn around.

540
00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:39,040
What about your  friend back there?

541
00:41:39,050 --> 00:41:40,640
If we're gonna go down,

542
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:43,640
might as well go down swinging.

543
00:41:54,250 --> 00:41:56,050
Come on,come on,come on...

544
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:59,190
Connecting 505-555-0162

545
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:02,910
we are in business.

546
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,440
it's going through.

547
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:07,490
Come on,sara,pick up.

548
00:42:32,930 --> 00:42:34,410
Sara?

549
00:42:57,150 --> 00:42:58,810
Hello?

550
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:01,030
Hello? Michael?

551
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:03,020
Michael?
