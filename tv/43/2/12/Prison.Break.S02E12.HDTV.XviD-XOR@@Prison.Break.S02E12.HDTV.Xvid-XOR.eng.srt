<i>Previously on Prison Break:</i>

00:00:02,396 --> 00:00:04,351
Listen, why don't I just
give you half the money

3
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:05,309
we call it a day?

4
00:00:05,981 --> 00:00:06,960
All right, 60/40.

5
00:00:07,566 --> 00:00:09,565
You thieving son of a bitch.

6
00:00:09,639 --> 00:00:11,485
You better get down on your
knees and pray to God

7
00:00:11,525 --> 00:00:12,701
that I don't find you.

8
00:00:12,861 --> 00:00:14,505
Because if I do,
mark my words,

9
00:00:15,092 --> 00:00:16,932
<i>I'm gonna gut you
bow to stern.</i>

10
00:00:17,227 --> 00:00:18,772
Mr. Bellick?
Yeah?

11
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,668
Do you mind answering
a few more questions?

12
00:00:21,251 --> 00:00:22,587
<i>We have a lead as to where
Burroughs will be meeting up</i>

13
00:00:22,667 --> 00:00:23,678

14
00:00:23,784 --> 00:00:26,007
<i>It's a place he referred to
as "Bolshoi booze."</i>

15
00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:27,129
They're numbers.

16
00:00:27,314 --> 00:00:29,305
Plug 'em into your GPS
they'll take you to a spot

17
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:30,617
<i>in the New Mexico desert.</i>

18
00:00:32,041 --> 00:00:33,064
Daddy!

19
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:34,600
Hey, baby, you ready to go?

20
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,545
Go, go, go, go, go!

21
00:00:38,191 --> 00:00:39,512
What do we do now?

22
00:00:39,897 --> 00:00:40,462
(shrieks)

23
00:00:40,687 --> 00:00:41,254
(electrical zapping)

24
00:00:43,655 --> 00:00:44,566
She told you anything?

25
00:00:44,718 --> 00:00:45,718
Not yet.

26
00:00:45,848 --> 00:00:46,743
Then kill her.

27
00:00:46,823 --> 00:00:47,982
Well, she knows something.

28
00:00:48,189 --> 00:00:49,614
You disobey me, you are done!

29
00:00:49,902 --> 00:00:51,261
Put her in the ground, Paul!

30
00:00:51,604 --> 00:00:52,629
You're going to die,

31
00:00:52,831 --> 00:00:56,061
and all you had to do was tell
me what your father gave you.

32
00:00:56,333 --> 00:00:57,419
Go to hell.

33
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:01,130
Go!

34
00:01:03,088 --> 00:01:05,384
The plane's gonna stop
at the seven-mile marker,

35
00:01:06,015 --> 00:01:08,199
Route 4 at sunset.

36
00:01:08,323 --> 00:01:09,959
We got to go.
I brought someone.

37
00:01:10,127 --> 00:01:10,999
Dad?

38
00:01:13,046 --> 00:01:14,085
We met before.

39
00:01:18,886 --> 00:01:20,053
It was you.

40
00:01:20,422 --> 00:01:21,668
Go easy, son.

41
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:24,179
Stay away from me.

42
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:26,255
What the hell's going on?

43
00:01:26,341 --> 00:01:27,117
I know him.

44
00:01:27,188 --> 00:01:28,581
What do you mean you know him?
That's impossible.

45
00:01:28,636 --> 00:01:29,132
I know him.

46
00:01:29,235 --> 00:01:30,348
I know this man!

47
00:01:40,196 --> 00:01:40,812
Michael...

48
00:01:40,915 --> 00:01:41,938
Maybe that's far enough.

49
00:01:42,034 --> 00:01:43,288
This doesn't concern you.

50
00:01:43,451 --> 00:01:44,612
What the hell's going on, Dad?

51
00:01:50,922 --> 00:01:52,185
After Mom died...

52
00:01:53,784 --> 00:01:55,024
you were in juvie.

53
00:01:57,223 --> 00:01:58,671
They put me with this...

54
00:01:59,447 --> 00:02:00,968
this foster father

55
00:02:01,342 --> 00:02:02,863
down on Pershing Avenue.

56
00:02:05,998 --> 00:02:07,253
He punished me,

57
00:02:08,806 --> 00:02:10,230
locked me up.

58
00:02:11,359 --> 00:02:13,549
<i>If you leave someone alone

60
00:02:18,564 --> 00:02:22,172

65
00:02:37,405 --> 00:02:38,682

67
00:02:46,495 --> 00:02:47,311
Get up!

68
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,400
ANNOUNCER (on TV):
Now everyone can fish like a pro
with Moto Lure.

69
00:03:06,467 --> 00:03:09,067
MAN:
You know, I've been fishing
most of my life.

70
00:03:09,134 --> 00:03:11,067
I've used just about every lure
that you could use.

71
00:03:11,134 --> 00:03:14,001
Most of them, you need to be
an expert to use.

72
00:03:14,067 --> 00:03:16,101
This Moto Lure's
a little different.

73
00:03:16,168 --> 00:03:19,300
Everybody, I mean everybody,
can fish with it.

74
00:03:19,367 --> 00:03:21,268
And you're gonna catch bigger
fish,

75
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:22,600
you're gonna catch more fish.

76
00:03:22,667 --> 00:03:24,634
(knocking at door)
It even works in weedy areas

77
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:27,234
where most top-water lures
won't work.

78
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,433
Take a look at this baby.

79
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,967
This thing looks
like a real minnow.

80
00:03:31,034 --> 00:03:33,901
This is one very cool bait.

81
00:03:33,967 --> 00:03:35,567
I have never seen anything
quite like this.

82
00:03:35,634 --> 00:03:36,400
(knocking)

83
00:03:36,467 --> 00:03:37,801
Even if you've bought lures

84
00:03:37,867 --> 00:03:39,234
off of TV in the past

85
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:39,316
and been disappointed--

86
00:03:39,895 --> 00:03:41,412
and believe me,
I know how you feel--

87
00:03:41,634 --> 00:03:42,927
Hey.
Sorry, man.

88
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:43,995
I thought you'd left.

89
00:03:44,106 --> 00:03:45,855
No, still here.
Here I am.

90
00:03:46,022 --> 00:03:47,621
Yeah, it's just that
a couple of guests

91
00:03:47,717 --> 00:03:49,878
are complaining
about the volume
of your TV.

92
00:03:50,093 --> 00:03:52,387
Oh, sorry, I fell asleep.

93
00:03:52,454 --> 00:03:54,204
I must have hit the remote.

94
00:03:54,524 --> 00:03:56,341
I'll take care of it.
Thanks. Sorry. Thanks.

95
00:03:56,724 --> 00:04:00,691
Great. Um, so could you
do that for me now, please,

96
00:04:00,851 --> 00:04:02,147
so it's taken care of?

97
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:03,587
Yeah.
Thanks.

98
00:04:03,471 --> 00:04:06,176
And the Moto Lure series
makes a great gift for anyone...

99
00:04:07,059 --> 00:04:07,706
(volume lowers)

100
00:04:14,904 --> 00:04:15,783
Taken care of.

101
00:04:16,336 --> 00:04:17,056
(water sloshing)

102
00:04:18,766 --> 00:04:21,071
Is, uh, everything okay
in your bathroom?

103
00:04:22,495 --> 00:04:23,302
Excuse me?

104
00:04:24,711 --> 00:04:26,710
Your bathroom.
There's a noise coming from it.

105
00:04:26,862 --> 00:04:29,006
Yeah, my daughter thinks
bath time is playtime.

106
00:04:30,213 --> 00:04:33,069
I will clean it up.
Scout's honor. Sorry.

107
00:04:34,573 --> 00:04:36,476
All right.
Have a nice day.

108
00:04:36,611 --> 00:04:37,892
Yeah, you, too.

109
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:51,765
Michael, Michael,
please wait.
Michael?

110
00:04:51,854 --> 00:04:52,652
He did this to you?

111
00:04:52,754 --> 00:04:54,267
Michael!
Lincoln!

112
00:04:57,258 --> 00:04:58,297
He did this to you?

113
00:05:01,242 --> 00:05:02,370
He did this to you?

114
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,541
How could you do that

115
00:05:12,656 --> 00:05:16,237
<i>to another human being
with your own hands?</i>

116

(door opens)

117
00:05:27,234 --> 00:05:30,121
It's okay. You're safe now.

118
00:05:35,312 --> 00:05:37,024
He's not going
to hurt you anymore.

119
00:05:46,086 --> 00:05:47,190
Come on.

120
00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:50,455
Come with me
and don't look back.

121
00:06:02,786 --> 00:06:03,827
Michael!

122
00:06:04,575 --> 00:06:04,752
<i>Michael!</i>

123
00:06:05,968 --> 00:06:07,166

(wind whistling)

125
00:06:15,405 --> 00:06:17,157

Six months

129
00:09:11,869 --> 00:09:13,468
Six months I was
in that place.

130
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:16,089
Where were you?

131
00:09:17,417 --> 00:09:18,761
How long did you know?

132
00:09:18,923 --> 00:09:20,123
I found you
as soon as I could.

133
00:09:20,217 --> 00:09:21,674
The state kept moving
you around.

134
00:09:21,763 --> 00:09:23,065
Then you went away again,
right?

135
00:09:23,169 --> 00:09:25,328
You don't think
it killed me to
leave you like that?

136
00:09:25,425 --> 00:09:27,104
To leave
in the first place?

137
00:09:27,209 --> 00:09:29,264
Since the beginning,
I was the problem.

138
00:09:29,424 --> 00:09:30,360
Since day one.

139
00:09:30,656 --> 00:09:32,400
Your lives are what they are
because of me.

140
00:09:32,535 --> 00:09:34,111
Yes, Linc told me
about the Company.

141
00:09:34,233 --> 00:09:35,762
Apparently, you were some kind
of analyst.

142
00:09:35,823 --> 00:09:37,749
That's the job
you chose over
your family.

143
00:09:37,887 --> 00:09:39,191
I thought I was doing
the right thing.

144
00:09:39,246 --> 00:09:40,575
I thought I was protecting you.

145
00:09:40,662 --> 00:09:42,023
From what, Dad,
from who?

146
00:09:43,014 --> 00:09:44,511
The Company had enemies!

147
00:09:44,605 --> 00:09:46,253
I was important
to the Company.

148
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:47,430
I became a target.

149
00:09:47,533 --> 00:09:48,709
Easiest way
to get to me

150
00:09:48,789 --> 00:09:49,989
would be to get to you!

151
00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:51,742
I left as soon
as I realized

152
00:09:51,765 --> 00:09:52,837
how corrupt it all was.

153
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:53,810
How they were buying
the government...

154
00:09:53,864 --> 00:09:55,505
You could have come back
at any time!

155
00:09:55,569 --> 00:09:56,885
No, I couldn't!

156
00:09:57,439 --> 00:09:59,634
Michael, turning on
the Company

157
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:02,178
put me and you
at even greater risk.

158
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:03,874
I had to stay away.

159
00:10:05,721 --> 00:10:07,265
We were your sons.

160
00:10:07,777 --> 00:10:09,241
And you still are, Michael.

161
00:10:10,002 --> 00:10:11,041
We can fix this.

162
00:10:12,033 --> 00:10:14,836
I came back
so that we could fix this.

163
00:10:16,687 --> 00:10:18,159
This can never be fixed.

164
00:10:22,311 --> 00:10:23,519
There's a tape.

165
00:10:25,006 --> 00:10:26,754
Gives us everything
we need.

00:10:28,446 --> 00:10:29,494
Linc will be set free

167
00:10:29,582 --> 00:10:30,904
if we find it.

168
00:10:31,429 --> 00:10:33,309
You're not gonna believe
who he thinks has it.

169
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:35,517
Who?

170
00:10:36,717 --> 00:10:38,029
Sara.

171
00:10:42,508 --> 00:10:46,067
Yes, uh, tall and slender,
brown hair, brown eyes.

172
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:47,722
She'd be pretty banged up.

173
00:10:48,394 --> 00:10:51,546
WOMAN:
No one matching that description
has been brought into the ER.

174
00:10:56,697 --> 00:10:57,601
Kellerman.

175
00:10:58,648 --> 00:11:00,056
No report on Sara Tancredi?

176
00:11:00,087 --> 00:11:00,861
She's dead.

177
00:11:00,882 --> 00:11:02,249
I'm dealing with the body
right now.

178
00:11:04,424 --> 00:11:06,224
You must be relieved
that it's over.

179
00:11:06,225 --> 00:11:06,964
Yeah.

180
00:11:06,952 --> 00:11:07,848
Yeah, I got to go.

181
00:11:07,912 --> 00:11:11,095
One more thing: confirmation.

182
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:13,879
I need a photo of the body
before disposal.

183
00:11:14,033 --> 00:11:15,884
Uh, take one with your phone
and send it to me and I'll...

184
00:11:15,965 --> 00:11:18,020
Bill not a good time
right now, all right?

185
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:25,017
Paul, take a breath,
then take the picture.

186
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,400
I'm waiting.

187
00:11:31,296 --> 00:11:31,672
(receiver clicks)

188
00:11:37,287 --> 00:11:40,095
"The trail led
to a very dangerous place.

189
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:41,879
"Now, Arvid knew that,

190
00:11:42,266 --> 00:11:44,590
"but he held tightly
onto the dragon's
leash anyway,

191
00:11:44,709 --> 00:11:46,965
"as the creature ran
into the Everdark Forest,

192
00:11:47,029 --> 00:11:49,286
pulling the young boy
behind him."

193
00:11:49,974 --> 00:11:51,805
Why didn't he just
let go of the leash?

194
00:11:52,405 --> 00:11:54,499
Well, because
he loved the dragon.

195
00:11:55,488 --> 00:11:56,959
Now, when you love someone,

196
00:11:57,199 --> 00:11:59,533
you'll do anything
to hold onto them.

197
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:03,420
Anything to keep them
safe and happy.

198
00:12:04,196 --> 00:12:05,468
Is that why we're camping?

199
00:12:06,834 --> 00:12:09,355
Yep. So we can all be together.

200
00:12:10,411 --> 00:12:11,626
I'm happy.

201
00:12:14,818 --> 00:12:16,218
I'm happy, too.

202
00:12:24,185 --> 00:12:25,271
Here you go.

203
00:12:39,326 --> 00:12:41,077
Well, it's all
working out, huh?

204
00:12:41,534 --> 00:12:42,541
Don't say that.

205
00:12:56,892 --> 00:12:59,499
You know, this moment,
right here, right now,

206
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:02,899
it's all worth it.

207
00:13:07,097 --> 00:13:08,690
I love you.

208
00:13:09,769 --> 00:13:11,145
I love you, too.

209
00:13:37,237 --> 00:13:38,381
That's old.

210
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:40,228
The kids
are bigger now.

211
00:13:40,349 --> 00:13:41,371
Sorry. I was just...

212
00:13:41,497 --> 00:13:42,997
Getting bored
out of your wits

213
00:13:43,028 --> 00:13:44,448
'cause you been
waiting so long.

214
00:13:45,726 --> 00:13:47,069
Really sorry about all this.

215
00:13:47,542 --> 00:13:49,518
We don't get a whole bunch
of homicides out here,

216
00:13:49,589 --> 00:13:51,525
and, well, we're trying
to play catch-up.

217
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:52,940
Please, have a seat.

218
00:13:55,725 --> 00:13:57,389
I'm real sorry
about your friend.

219
00:13:58,709 --> 00:14:00,276
Sick world out there.

220
00:14:01,235 --> 00:14:02,560
Ain't that
the truth?

221
00:14:03,876 --> 00:14:05,724
So you guys out here
in Kansas together?

222
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:07,053
Yeah. That's right.

223
00:14:07,604 --> 00:14:08,628
Doing what?

224
00:14:09,347 --> 00:14:11,130
Well, you know,
just seeing the sights.

225
00:14:11,211 --> 00:14:13,626
You left Chicago
to see the sights
in Tribune, Kansas?

226
00:14:13,706 --> 00:14:16,082
Last time I checked,
a man could go where he wanted.

227
00:14:16,178 --> 00:14:17,369
Mr. Bellick...

228
00:14:17,457 --> 00:14:18,248
Brad.

229
00:14:20,129 --> 00:14:23,753
Brad. I don't really care
what you were doing out here.

230
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:25,920
We're both in
law enforcement.

231
00:14:26,039 --> 00:14:28,043
We can each sniff out a perp
like a hot fart.

232
00:14:28,903 --> 00:14:30,122
Pardon my French.

233
00:14:30,237 --> 00:14:30,911
(chuckles)

234
00:14:31,687 --> 00:14:33,870
We both know
you're not a criminal, so...

235
00:14:34,552 --> 00:14:36,214
I don't care if you
boys were out here

236
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:38,398
whoopin' it without your wives
or...

237
00:14:40,389 --> 00:14:41,853
<i>going Brokeback.</i>

238
00:14:41,998 --> 00:14:44,469
What? Hell, no.

239
00:14:44,933 --> 00:14:45,852
My point is,

240
00:14:46,101 --> 00:14:47,558
I don't care
what you were doing.

241
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:49,309
I just need to know
where you were doing it

242
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:50,420
and who you might
have crossed paths with

243
00:14:50,508 --> 00:14:53,220
so I can find out
who carved up Mr. Geary.

244
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:02,562
Geary and I got a lead
that one of the Fox River Eight

245
00:15:02,642 --> 00:15:04,313
was in town.

246
00:15:06,209 --> 00:15:07,347
Which one?

247
00:15:07,801 --> 00:15:09,433
Theodore Bagwell.

248
00:15:09,657 --> 00:15:11,161
The man who did
all those horrible things

249
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:12,648
to those teenagers?
That's him.

250
00:15:12,889 --> 00:15:14,072
We were going to bring him in

251
00:15:14,161 --> 00:15:16,312
for the reward money, but we
couldn't get a handle on him.

252
00:15:16,376 --> 00:15:19,015
Geary and I split up, figured
we didn't have a shot, but...

253
00:15:19,098 --> 00:15:21,279
But what?
Well, after
what happened,

254
00:15:21,407 --> 00:15:23,047
I'm starting to think maybe

255
00:15:23,071 --> 00:15:25,839
Geary ran into ol' Bagwell
after all.

256
00:15:25,945 --> 00:15:27,432
Right here in Tribune?

257
00:15:29,826 --> 00:15:32,091
Now, Brad, do you think
you could answer some questions

258
00:15:32,126 --> 00:15:35,652
that might help us
track down Theodore Bagwell?

259
00:15:36,028 --> 00:15:37,141
I'd be indebted.

260
00:15:37,685 --> 00:15:38,940
I'll do whatever I can

261
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:40,887
to help you nail
that son of a bitch.

262
00:15:41,388 --> 00:15:43,107
You think Sara
has this tape?

263
00:15:43,394 --> 00:15:44,384
Government does.

264
00:15:46,844 --> 00:15:48,154
I just saw her yesterday.
If she does

265
00:15:48,251 --> 00:15:50,827
have anything,
she doesn't know.

266
00:15:51,226 --> 00:15:52,376
Well, where is she now?

267
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:54,307
I don't know.

268
00:15:54,594 --> 00:15:55,834
Any way you can get
in touch with her?

269
00:15:57,001 --> 00:15:58,697
We brought cell phones.
I could call her.

270
00:15:58,785 --> 00:16:00,761
Please, please, please, bro,
call her

271
00:16:00,825 --> 00:16:02,385
from Panama.
Please.

272
00:16:03,169 --> 00:16:04,488
We got less
than two hours.

273
00:16:04,584 --> 00:16:05,896
I got to make the flight.

274
00:16:06,592 --> 00:16:06,802
(pebbles tumbling)

275
00:16:08,311 --> 00:16:09,981
Shh! Shh! Shh!

276
00:16:10,077 --> 00:16:11,341
What?

277
00:16:15,948 --> 00:16:16,758
Run.

278
00:16:16,862 --> 00:16:17,885
Run!

279
00:16:18,092 --> 00:16:18,365
(shots firing)

280
00:16:24,476 --> 00:16:26,075
Where's this car you
keep talking about?

281
00:16:26,371 --> 00:16:27,332
It's over the ridge.

282
00:16:27,563 --> 00:16:28,378
Give me that.

283
00:16:28,474 --> 00:16:29,595
You guys head for the car!

284
00:16:30,474 --> 00:16:31,186
Go!

285
00:16:48,679 --> 00:16:49,298
Come on! Go!

286
00:16:49,626 --> 00:16:50,759
Go back for him!

287
00:16:55,469 --> 00:16:56,195
Dad!

288
00:16:56,427 --> 00:16:57,434
Go!

289
00:17:11,657 --> 00:17:13,216
We made it! Son of a bitch!

290
00:17:13,329 --> 00:17:14,256
We made it!

291
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:22,479
linc.

292
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:35,702
Sucre, get us to a hospital.

293
00:17:35,742 --> 00:17:37,455
Out here? Where the hell
am I going to find...?

294
00:17:37,508 --> 00:17:39,165
Just get us
to a hospital, please!

295
00:17:39,709 --> 00:17:40,469
Okay.

296
00:17:40,597 --> 00:17:41,925
Don't worry.
You're going to make it.

297
00:17:43,133 --> 00:17:45,602
It's bile. He got me
clean through.

298
00:17:45,972 --> 00:17:48,724
You're going to be okay!
Just... hold on.

299
00:17:49,562 --> 00:17:51,795
Listen to me,
both of you.

300
00:17:54,227 --> 00:17:55,284
I'm sorry.

301
00:17:56,234 --> 00:17:57,554
I wish I had never left.

302
00:17:58,677 --> 00:18:02,152
Don't talk, don't talk.
Just breathe.

303
00:18:08,472 --> 00:18:10,992
Okay, so do you want a PB & B?

304
00:18:11,399 --> 00:18:12,415
Not really.

305
00:18:12,831 --> 00:18:14,248
My tummy hurts.

306
00:18:15,142 --> 00:18:16,207
Huh.

307
00:18:17,174 --> 00:18:18,190
Where's her knapsack?

308
00:18:19,414 --> 00:18:20,182
Her what?

309
00:18:21,221 --> 00:18:22,870
Her knapsack.
Her medicine's in it.

310
00:18:23,309 --> 00:18:25,308
I don't know, baby.
I just grabbed her and ran.

311
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:26,797
She needs that medicine.

312
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:28,388
She can't go two days
without it.

313
00:18:28,716 --> 00:18:29,325
Yeah, I know.

314
00:18:29,422 --> 00:18:30,748
I'm her father, all right?

315
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:33,149
Where is it?

316
00:18:33,309 --> 00:18:36,209
Baby. Baby, look. Calm down.
What are you looking for?

317
00:18:36,291 --> 00:18:38,578
Just tell me what it is, and
I'll go ahead and get it, okay?

318
00:18:39,568 --> 00:18:40,824
Her prescription.

319
00:18:42,306 --> 00:18:43,025
It's a backup.

320
00:18:43,098 --> 00:18:44,713
I keep an extra,
in case.

321
00:18:45,263 --> 00:18:46,019
Okay.

322
00:18:46,192 --> 00:18:47,089
Okay.

323
00:18:47,921 --> 00:18:52,286
Um... so all we need to do
is find a pharmacy.

324
00:18:56,525 --> 00:18:57,850
Don't worry.

325
00:18:58,887 --> 00:18:59,886
Hey, looks like we're going

326
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:01,222
on a ride,
sweet pea.

327
00:19:02,134 --> 00:19:03,726
Look, we nail Bagwell,

328
00:19:03,815 --> 00:19:05,192
he might still have
some of Geary's things on him,

329
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:08,296
like his backpack, which has
his personal stuff in it.

330
00:19:08,346 --> 00:19:09,815
I know his wife
would love to have it.

331
00:19:11,071 --> 00:19:13,207
If we find Bagwell,
you can give it
to her personally.

332
00:19:13,344 --> 00:19:14,775
Thanks.
It's the least
I can do

333
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:16,574
considering how
you're helping me out.

334
00:19:17,261 --> 00:19:19,671
Though some of the guys on the
force are concerned about...

335
00:19:20,197 --> 00:19:21,422
What are they concerned about?

336
00:19:22,165 --> 00:19:23,341
Nothing.

337
00:19:24,676 --> 00:19:25,468
But you know what?

338
00:19:25,623 --> 00:19:26,756
Why don't you tell me
what you know,

339
00:19:26,864 --> 00:19:28,796
we'll track down Bagwell,
we'll get Geary's effects back

340
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:29,829
to his family,
I'll make sure

341
00:19:29,908 --> 00:19:32,924
that everybody involved knows
that your help was invaluable.

342
00:19:33,035 --> 00:19:34,498
I'll even recommend
that you get most of,

343
00:19:34,589 --> 00:19:36,883
if not all of,
that reward money.

344
00:19:37,579 --> 00:19:38,874
What is it exactly

345
00:19:39,003 --> 00:19:41,082
that the guys on the force
were concerned about?

346
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:44,979
Well, some of them thought
that you weren't

347
00:19:45,075 --> 00:19:47,082
being totally upfront
about your head injury.

348
00:19:47,491 --> 00:19:50,164
I mean, to be fair,
it does seem a little off

349
00:19:50,244 --> 00:19:51,615
that you didn't see
the guy who hit you

350
00:19:51,724 --> 00:19:53,436
smack-dab on the forehead.

351
00:19:57,915 --> 00:19:59,060
You got me.

352
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:01,747
Geary and me

353
00:20:01,835 --> 00:20:05,427
had a little dustup over how
to go about finding Bagwell.

354
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:08,541
It got physical, and he hit me.

355
00:20:08,882 --> 00:20:10,274
The two of us, we
fought like brothers.

356
00:20:10,377 --> 00:20:12,690
I didn't want to rat
him out to the cops.

357
00:20:14,281 --> 00:20:16,450
After the fight,
we split up.

358
00:20:17,872 --> 00:20:19,089
And then...

359
00:20:21,928 --> 00:20:24,072
(sobbing):
Well, you know what
happened to him.

360
00:20:25,688 --> 00:20:28,135
I just wish to hell
we'd never fought, you know?

361
00:20:28,216 --> 00:20:30,007
Maybe then he'd still be...

362
00:20:32,214 --> 00:20:33,910
Brad, you can't blame yourself.

363
00:20:37,493 --> 00:20:39,674
Why don't we refocus our energy

364
00:20:39,779 --> 00:20:41,825
on finding the man
who killed your friend?

365
00:20:44,878 --> 00:20:46,910
That's what Roy would've wanted.

366
00:21:06,715 --> 00:21:08,060
All right, baby.

367
00:21:10,042 --> 00:21:10,898
Insurance card?

368
00:21:11,978 --> 00:21:13,658
Uh, no, I don't have insurance.

369
00:21:14,306 --> 00:21:16,249
You're paying for dexamethasone
without insurance?

370
00:21:17,705 --> 00:21:19,568
You got Medicaid,
Medicare or something?

371
00:21:21,162 --> 00:21:21,857
Nope.

372
00:21:22,066 --> 00:21:23,455
Um, I'll just pay cash.

373
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:24,949
It's $125.

374
00:21:37,398 --> 00:21:38,310
Excuse me?

375
00:21:40,111 --> 00:21:41,077
Excuse me?

376
00:21:43,765 --> 00:21:45,277
Um, oh, sorry.

377
00:21:55,418 --> 00:21:57,452
Sorry I don't have
anything smaller.

378
00:21:58,586 --> 00:22:02,314
Um, I have to go to the back
to get change for $100.

379
00:22:02,419 --> 00:22:04,018
So... I'll be right back.

380
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:17,882
Right there! Hospital!

381
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:18,672
I see it. I see it.

382
00:22:18,696 --> 00:22:19,815
Just get us there.

383
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:21,247
No, you'll be caught.

384
00:22:21,343 --> 00:22:22,399
Then we'll be caught.

385
00:22:24,063 --> 00:22:25,574
I'm not gonna
let you die.

386
00:22:25,998 --> 00:22:27,126
ALDO:
Then listen to me.

387
00:22:27,957 --> 00:22:29,798
You find Sara
Tancredi.

388
00:22:31,126 --> 00:22:32,702
She can end this.

389
00:22:34,788 --> 00:22:36,605
It's up to you now.

390
00:22:48,115 --> 00:22:50,131
Yeah, I want an alarm out
on a dark blue sedan.

391
00:22:50,211 --> 00:22:52,603
License: AE9268.

392
00:22:52,723 --> 00:22:55,425
40 miles southeast
of Los Cruces.

393
00:22:55,745 --> 00:22:57,090
Do it now.

394
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,335
(cell phone ringing)
Oh, come on!

395
00:23:03,717 --> 00:23:04,637
What?

396
00:23:07,037 --> 00:23:08,101
what hospital?

397
00:23:12,067 --> 00:23:14,034
MAN:
He came in with
a bad GSW.

398
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,401
Docs called us in.

399
00:23:15,467 --> 00:23:17,601
He's in here.

400
00:23:17,668 --> 00:23:19,401
We ran his name.

401
00:23:19,467 --> 00:23:22,567
Came back with two
federal drug smuggling
warrants out on him.

402
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,100
Heard you wanted to talk to me.

403
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,400
I got some information
the Feds want...

404
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,800
about Michael Scofield.

405
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:41,900
Like where he's
catching a ride.

406
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,000
And where would that be?

407
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:49,100
It's not just the "where"
but the "when."

408
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,700
That "when"
is coming up soon.

409
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,600
But I want to cut a deal first.

410
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,900
Give us a minute.

411
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:13,800
Anything you want
to say?

412
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:17,300
One day.

413
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:19,200
That's all we had.

414
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,500
He wasn't around often.

415
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:34,400
When he was,
it mattered most.

416
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:39,800
MICHAEL:
He was... in his way.

417
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:42,500
Yep, and we never knew.

418
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:47,000
Back then, when
things were

419
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
at their worst...

420
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,100
there were days
I thought I'd never 

421
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:52,400
see the sun again.

422
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:55,500
But he saved my life.

423
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,800
I just wish he could have let us
be a part of his.

424
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:10,300
Yeah.

425
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:21,600
I'll tell him. Okay.

426
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,200
Here's the deal.

427
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:29,900
All charges dropped
and the government

428
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:32,800
picks up medical costs
until you're fit to be deported,

429
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:35,600
all contingent upon your
information being accurate.

430
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,400
Where's Scofield?

431
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:41,800
No deportation.

432
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,600
I want citizenship.

433
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:46,000
Citizenship?

434
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:50,300
A little incentive,
and I want it in writing.

435
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:52,000
(groans softly)

436
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,600
I'm so tired of playing games.

437
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:55,900
Well, start typing.

438
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,100
No external pacemaker.

439
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,300
Oh, this is a good one--
no morphine drip.

440
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,400
Huh?

441
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,900
What are you doing?
FBI. Out.

442
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:12,000
Out! Out.

443
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,500
What the hell are you doing?

444
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:16,200
Giving you a little incentive.

445
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Come on!

446
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,700
Come on,
you son of a...

447
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,100
SLATTERY:
And they found nothing?

448
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:23,400
Okay, thanks.

449
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,500
Well, your instincts
are great, Brad,

450
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,300
but the precinct actually
sent a unit over to
Hollander's house today.

451
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:31,300
An anonymous caller
said they saw an intruder

452
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:32,300
but no one was there.

453
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:33,700
Damn it.

454
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,400
If you knew about Bagwell
and Hollander,

455
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,000
why didn't you just
head over there yourself?

456
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:40,900
We couldn't find the house.

457
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,300
Really?

458
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,600
It's listed.

459
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,800
(knocking)

460
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,200
Excuse me.

461
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:01,500
SLATTERY:
Thank you.

462
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:04,800
Everything okay?

463
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,800
Yeah, yeah, everything's fine.

464
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:12,200
Brad, have you ever been
to the Fauntleroy Hotel?

465
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,900
It's about 15
minutes from here.
Never heard of it.

466
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:17,500
Well, that's strange,
'cause they found

467
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:19,900
this receipt in
Geary's hotel room.

468
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:21,200
It's from your credit card.

469
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:26,600
I don't know how that got there.

470
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,600
I think you're being evasive.

471
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:37,000
You should tell me the
truth, Mr. Bellick.

472
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:38,600
What happened to "Brad"?

473
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:41,800
About seven years
ago, I got my first

474
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,600
homicide case--
a woman, pretty.

475
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:44,900
She was brutally
attacked.

476
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:46,800
Animal boyfriend
left her for dead,

477
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,600
but she was still
breathing... barely.

478
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:52,600
But she punched
into her cell phone

479
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:56,000
the killer's number, so she
solved the crime for us.

480
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:58,800
When we found
the receipt, Brad,

481
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:01,600
it was in Geary's hand, his
finger pointing to your name.

482
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,100
With his last ounce of strength,
he told us you killed him.

483
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:05,100
Okay, listen.

484
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:08,300
Geary and I found Bagwell
at Hollander's house.

485
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:09,200
We roughed him up

486
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,800
till he told us where he'd hid
the five million bucks

487
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,500
we knew he dug up in Utah.

488
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:16,400
When we found the money,
Geary double-crossed me.

489
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,500
He hit me in the head
and took the cash.

490
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,200
I had nothing to do
with Geary's death.

491
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,500
You hear
what I'm saying?

492
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:24,700
I'm the victim here,
not that son of a bitch!

493
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,300
Come on, come on, come on.

494
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:39,500
Where are you at, baby?

495
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,100
Hey, uh, could you hurry it up?

496
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,600
It's just it's getting
really late-- I got to get home.

497
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:56,900
Here you go.

498
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:59,400
And, um, that's $20,

499
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,600
$40, $50,

500
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,700
and $20 is $70.

501
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,100
One, two, three,

502
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:06,100
four...

503
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:08,800
five... seventy-five.

504
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,000
???

505
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,000
You got to be kidding me.

506
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:35,900
Ma'am.

507
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:38,800
Afternoon, Officer.

508
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:42,900
Do you have any
ID with you?

509
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:45,300
Uh, no.
I walked over here,

510
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:47,000
so I didn't carry anything
with me.

511
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,100
OFFICER:
Did you?
Where'd you walk from?

512
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:52,100
Is there a problem,
Officer?

513
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:54,700
There's only a problem
if you make one, Ms. Franklin.

514
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:57,600
You want to tell us
where your husband is?

515
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:01,600
I don't know.

516
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,600
Place your hands behind
your back, please, ma'am.

517
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,900
Baby, I'm so sorry.

518
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,000
Oh, my God.

519
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:39,000
Where's Mommy?

520
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:45,600
Mommy, uh, Mommy is going
to meet us later.Okay?

521
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,100
Yes.

522
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,400
KIM:
Where's the photo?

523
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,300
Bill, there was
a tactical error.

524
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:58,300
I don't want terminology

525
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:00,000
<i>from the Cover Your Ass
Handbook, Paul.</i>

526
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,800
What happened?

527
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,200
There were unforeseen
circumstances,

528
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,700
things that could not
be predicted.

529
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:06,500
Where's Sara?

530
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:11,000
She's gone, isn't she?

531
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:17,300
Yes, she got away,

532
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:19,900
but there's no way
that she could...

533
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:21,400
Bill.

534
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,300
(sniffles)

535
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:49,700
(exhales forcefully)

536
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:04,200
(sniffles)

537
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:21,000
(grunts)

538
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:35,500
I'm not going
to let you die.

539
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:41,000
I love you.

540
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,800
You know that, don't you?

541
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:02,200
Too many.

542
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:07,100
Too many people died
because I wanted you to be free.

543
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:09,200
You couldn't have known,

544
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,100
Michael.

545
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,400
You couldn't
have know it...

546
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,200
would have ended up like this.

547
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,100
But it did.

548
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,600
They wanted him.

549
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,600
They wanted him
in the ground,

550
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,200
and they got their wish.

551
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:29,000
This thing is not going
to end here, Michael.

552
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,300
I know.

553
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,600
It's going to
keep spreading.

554
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,400
Their hands are going
to get more and more bloody.

555
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,800
Well, the question is,

556
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:45,100
is the blood on their hands...
or ours?

557
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,500
I'm sorry, guys.

558
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,600
We got to go.

559
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:16,700
Get back on with Border Patrol.

560
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:18,900
Call the Navy Reserve air
station in Dallas.

561
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:20,200
They've got planes on alert.

562
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:21,700
We need an intercept of a white,

563
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:24,700
single engine A-36 Beech
heading toward the border.

564
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:27,400
Call Mexico, get clearance
for an international pursuit.

565
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:30,100
Tell them if they got to take
the plane down, just do it.

566
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:16,200
Come on, guys!

567
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,000
Guys, come on.

568
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Come on, guys.

569
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,300
What?

570
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:27,900
We're staying.

571
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,500
<i> Ay, vamonos!
Esperate, esperate,
esperate.</i>

572
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:37,200
Michael, this is what
we've been waiting for.

573
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,500
Maybe we'll see you down there
somewhere.

574
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:43,200
I can't talk you
out of this one, can I?

575
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:52,700
Well, I hope so.

576
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:54,700
Be good.

577
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:56,600
Thank you, Michael.

578
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,400
Thank you for everything.

579
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,200
Take care,
all right?

580
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:07,200
I will.

581
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,300
Fly safe, papi.

582
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,700
<i> Andele!  Andele!</i>

583
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,400
Give 'em hell.

584
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,200
Panama would've been good.

585
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,500
Are you ready for this?

586
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:37,100
Been waiting years.

587
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:38,300
Good to hear it.

588
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:40,600
'Cause today is the day
we stop running.

589
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:55,900
What now?

590
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,400
We go back to the car.

591
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:58,500
I drive to a border town,

592
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:00,200
find a cell phone signal.

593
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,800
Call Sara.

594
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:16,300
Where the hell are those jets?!

595
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:27,500
(low rumbling)

596
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:28,600
You hear that?

597
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:29,700
Yeah.

598
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,300
Pull over.

599
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:44,000
(rumbling)

600
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,800
Oh, God, they're going
after Sucre.

601
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,500
They're gonna take him down.

602
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,000
How'd they find out?

603
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,200
I don't know.

604
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:00,700
Michael.

605
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:10,100
(engine starts)

606
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:33,800
I want to know what
the hell's going on.

607
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,800
If you could've arrested me,
you would've already done it.

608
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:36,800
I'm out of here.

609
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,600
Not really an option
for you, Mr. Bellick.

610
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,600
What do you got, a receipt?
He left it in his pocket.

611
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:41,800
A fight?
Big deal.

612
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:44,000
I got ten pals in Chicago
tell you Geary and I

613
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,400
threw down once a month.

614
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:46,800
You're right.

615
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,200
Any of those things
on their own,

616
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:49,300
probably not enough.

617
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:51,000
But when you add this...

618
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,100
What the hell's that?

619
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:55,800
You left a message
for Mr. Geary.

620
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,900
You thieving son of a bitch,
you better

621
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:02,300
get down on your knees and pray
to God that I don't find you.

622
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,600
Because if I do, mark my words:

623
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:07,400
I'm gonna gut you bow to stern.

624
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,200
You want to hear it again?

625
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:16,200
Now at this
juncture, Brad,

626
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:18,200
things will go a whole
lot easier for you

627
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,500
if you admit
to the crime.

628
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Now you listen to me,
you manipulative little bitch.

629
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:26,100
I did not kill Roy Geary!

630
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:27,900
You understand
what I'm telling you!

631
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:29,500
Bagwell set me up!

632
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,200
Get your hands off of me!

633
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,800
Bradley Bellick,
you are under arrest

634
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,900
for the first-degree murder
of Roy William Geary.

635
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:35,900
You have a right
to remain silent.

636
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:38,100
Anything you say can be used
against you in a court of law.

637
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:39,200
You have a right to
talk with an attorney

638
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,300
and to have him present with you
when being questioned.

639
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:42,500
If you cannot hire
an attorney...

640
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:54,300
(line ringing)

641
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,900
WOMAN:
President Reynolds' office.

642
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:57,000
This is Agent Paul Kellerman.

643
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,200
I need to speak with the
president right now, please.

644
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:00,800
???

645
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,300
isn't familiar
with an Agent Kellerman.

646
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:04,400
June, it's me.

647
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:07,100
I need to speak
with Caroline now.

648
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,400
June, if you don't
put me through,

649
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:10,500
I'll make certain that
the president

650
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:12,300
knows that you were the one
who did not allow me

651
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:14,700
to provide her with some
very important information.

652
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:15,500
Now.

653
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:17,900
I'm sorry,

654
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:20,100
this administration
isn't familiar with an Agent...

655
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:21,100
(phone slams)

656
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,400
(mechanical voice):
Please leave a message
after the tone.

657
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,100
(machine beeps)

658
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,500
Bill, don't do this.

659
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:41,500
I've dedicated my life
to this country, to Caroline.

660
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,400
Everything I have, I give.

661
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:45,600
Every photo, every file.

662
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:46,900
Get rid of it all.

663
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:48,900
Make him a ghost.

664
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:50,400
I've been a perfect soldier.

665
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,900
I've never asked
anything of you, ever.

666
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,800
But I'm asking now.

667
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,800
Bill, don't do this.

668
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,100
I don't see him.

669
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,300
Trust me,

670
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:08,100
we haven't lost him yet.

671
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,400
Linc?
Hmm.

672
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,300
Stop the car.

673
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:20,300
What?

674
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:22,100
We got to stop the car.

675
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:30,500
That's a radio tower over there.

676
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:33,600
It must be picking up
some kind of analog signal.

677
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:35,500
We got to get closer.

678
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:36,700
Turn around.

679
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:39,100
What about your friend
back there?

680
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:40,400
If we're gonna go down,

681
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:43,100
might as well go down swinging.

682
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:56,800
Come on, come on, come on...

683
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:58,000
(beeps)

684
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:02,700
We are in business.

685
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:04,000
(beeps)
It's going through.

686
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:07,100
Come on, Sara, pick up.

687
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:32,100
(line ringing)

688
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,200
Sara.

689
00:42:57,300 --> 00:43:00,600
SARA:
Hello? Hello? Michael? 

690
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:04,200
Michael? Michael?

691
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:06,000
