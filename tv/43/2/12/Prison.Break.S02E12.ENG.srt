1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,630
Previously on prison break:

2
00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:04,280
Listen,why don't I just give you half the money we call it a day?

3
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:06,530
All right,60/40.

4
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:08,710
You thieving son of a bitch.

5
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:11,820
You better get down on your knees and pray to god that I don't find you.

6
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:16,200
Because if I do,mark my words, I'm gonna gut you bow to stern.

7
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,860
- Mr. Bellick? - Yeah?

8
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:19,990
Do you mind answering a few more questions?

9
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:22,940
We have a lead as to where burroughs will be meeting up with his brother.

10
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:25,210
It's a place he referred to as "bolshoi booze.°±

11
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:26,240
They're numbers.

12
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:29,830
Plug 'em into your gps they'll take you to a spot in the new mexico desert.

13
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:33,640
- Daddy! - Hey,baby,you ready to go?

14
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:36,010
Go,go,go,go,go!

15
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:38,770
What do we do now?

16
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:44,940
- she told you anything? - Not yet.

17
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:47,320
- Then kill her. - Well,she knows something.

18
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:50,770
You disobey me,you are done! Put her in the ground,paul!

19
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:55,100
You're going to die,and all you had to do was tell me what your father gave you.

20
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:57,080
Go to hell.

21
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:01,110
Go!

22
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:04,940
The plane's gonna stop at the seven-mile marker,

23
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:07,220
route 4 at sunset.

24
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:09,160
- We got to go. - I brought someone.

25
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,600
Dad?

26
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:13,760
We met before.

27
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:19,590
It was you.

28
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:21,400
Go easy,son.

29
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,790
Stay away from me.

30
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,100
- What the hell's going on? - I know him.

31
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,800
What do you mean you know him? That's impossible.

32
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,700
I know him. I know this man!

33
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,130
- Michael... - Maybe that's far enough.

34
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:42,590
This doesn't concern you.

35
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:44,330
What the hell's going on,dad?

36
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:51,810
After mom died...

37
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:54,680
you were in juvie.

38
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,120
They put me with this...

39
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,200
this foster father down on pershing avenue.

40
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:06,730
He punished me,

41
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:09,540
locked me up.

42
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:13,120
If you leave someone alone in the dark for that long,

43
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,190
their eyes start to adjust.

44
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:21,200
You start to see things,no matter how small,

45
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:27,180
because if they exist,they can help you.

46
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:32,630
help you do the only thing you want to do...

47
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:35,380
when you're alone in the dark:

48
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:38,270
Get out.

49
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:10,520
I've used just about every lure that you could use.

50
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:13,480
Most of them,you need to be an expert to use.

51
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,440
This moto lure's a little different.

52
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,030
Everybody,I mean everybody,can fish with it.

53
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:21,450
And you're gonna catch bigger fish, you're gonna catch more fish.

54
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:25,800
it even works in weedy areas where most top-water lures won't work.

55
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:28,290
Take a look at this baby.

56
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:30,200
This thing looks like a real minnow.

57
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,250
This is one very cool bait.

58
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:35,030
I have never sn anything quite like this.

59
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:38,760
even if you've bought lures off of tv in the past and been disappointed--

60
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,820
and believe me,I know how you feel--

61
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,300
- hey. - Sorry,man.I thought you'd left.

62
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:45,300
No,still here. Here I am.

63
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:49,190
Yeah,it's just that a couple of guests are complaining about the volume of your tv.

64
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:51,730
Oh,sorry,I fell asleep.

65
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:54,430
I must have hit the remote. I'll take care of it.

66
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:55,950
Thanks.Sorry. Thanks.Great.

67
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:01,310
Um,so could you do that for me now, please,so it's taken care of?

68
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:03,040
Yeah. Thanks.

69
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:15,580
taken care of .

70
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:20,780
is,uh,everything okay in your bathroom?

71
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:23,310
Excuse me?

72
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,780
Your bathroom. There's a noise coming from it.

73
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:28,310
Yeah,my daughter thinks bath time is playtime.

74
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:32,160
I will clean it up. Scout's honor.Sorry.

75
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,770
All right. Have a nice day.

76
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:37,620
Yeah,you,too.

77
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:49,910
- Michael, - Michael?

78
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:51,870
- michael,please wait. - He did this to you?

79
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:53,760
- Michael! - Lincoln!

80
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:58,060
He did this to you?

81
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:02,120
He did this to you?

82
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:09,870
Michael!

83
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:15,290
How could you do that to another human being with your own hands?

84
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:29,130
it's okay. You're safe now.

85
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,630
He's not going to hurt you anymore.

86
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,390
Come on.

87
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:50,250
Come with me and don't look back.

88
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:03,400
Michael!

89
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:06,640
Michael...

90
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:16,380
it's gonna be all right.

94
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:12,490
Six months I was in that place.

95
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,060
Where were you?

96
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:17,500
How long did you know?

97
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:20,250
I found you as soon as I could. The state kept moving you around.

98
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:21,730
Then you went away again,right?

99
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:24,160
You don't think it killed me to leave you like that?

100
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,850
To leave in the first place?

101
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:28,990
Since the beginning,I was the problem. Since day one.

102
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:31,060
Your lives are what they are because of me.

103
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:32,940
Yes,linc told me about the company.

104
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:36,360
Apparently,you were some kind of analyst. That's the job you chose over your family.

105
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:39,160
I thought I was doing the right thing. I thought I was protecting you.

106
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,930
From what,dad,from who?

107
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,850
The company had enemies! I was important to the company.

108
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:48,770
I became a target. Easiest way to get to me would be to get to you!

109
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:52,480
I left as soon as I realized how corrupt it all was. How they were buying the government...

110
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,440
- you could have come back at any time! - No,I couldn't!

111
00:09:56,060 --> 00:10:00,600
Michael,turning on the company put me and you at even greater risk.

112
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:03,180
I had to stay away.

113
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:06,130
We were your sons.

114
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:08,560
And you still are,michael.

115
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,500
We can fix this.

116
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,560
I came back so that we could fix this.

117
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:17,300
This can never be fixed.

118
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:23,020
There's a tape.

119
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,830
Gives us everything we need.

120
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:29,580
Linc will be set free if we find it.

121
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:32,680
You're not gonna believe who he thinks has it.

122
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:34,800
Who?

123
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,220
Sara.

124
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,650
Yes,uh,tall and slender, brown hair,brown eyes.

125
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,930
She'd be pretty banged up.

126
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:50,150
No one matching that description has been brought into the er.

127
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:56,640
Kellerman.

128
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:58,660
No report on sara tancredi?

129
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:00,950
She's dead. I'm dealing with the body right now.

130
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,750
You must be relieved that it's over.

131
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,330
Yeah. Yeah,I got to go.

132
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:09,470
One more thing: Confirmation.

133
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,510
I need a photo of the body before disposal.

134
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:14,760
Uh,take one with your phone and send it to me and I'll...

135
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:17,070
bill not a good time right now,all right?

136
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:23,530
Paul,take a breath,then take the picture.

137
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,510
I'm waiting.

"as the creature ran into the everdark forest, pulling the young boy behind him.°±

142
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:50,730
Why didn't he just let go of the leash?

143
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:53,660
Well,because he loved the dragon.

144
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:58,040
Now,when you love someone,you'll do anything to hold onto them.

145
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:02,350
Anything to keep them safe and happy.

146
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:04,650
Is that why we're camping?

147
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:08,210
Yep. So we can all be together.

148
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,800
I'm happy.

149
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:15,350

00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:42,140
Don't say that.

153
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:58,300
You know,this moment,right here,right now,

154
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:01,970
it's all worth it.

We don't get a whole bunch of homicides out here, and,well,we're trying to play catch-up.

164
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:51,930
Please,have a seat.

165
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,180
I'm real sorry about your friend.

166
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,160
Sick world out there.

167
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:01,420
Ain't that the truth?

168
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,360
So you guys out here in kansas together?

169
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,750
Yeah. That's right.

170
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,350
Doing what?

171
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,630
Well,you know,just seeing the sights.

172
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:12,200
You left chicago to see the sights in tribune,kansas?

173
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,700
Last time I checked,a man could go where he wanted.

174
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,080
Mr. Bellick...

175
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,710
brad.

176
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:19,960
Brad.

177
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:22,400
I don't really care what you were doing out here.

178
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:26,600
We're both in law enforcement. We can each sniff out a perp like a hot fart.

179
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:29,060
Pardon my french.

180
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,680
we both know you're not a criminal,so...

181
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:36,820
I don't care if you boys were out here whoopin' it without your wives or...

182
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:40,510
going brokeback.

183
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:41,880
What?

184
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,400
Hell,no.

185
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:46,130
My point is,I don't care what you were doing.

186
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:49,580
I just need to know where you were doing it and who you might have crossed paths with so

187
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:52,230
I can find out who carved up Mr. Geary.

188
00:14:57,810 --> 00:15:02,610
Geary and I got a lead that one of the fox river eight was in town.

189
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:05,990
Which one?

190
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:08,070
Theodore bagwell.

191
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:10,300
The man who did all those horrible things to those teenagers?

192
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:11,410
That's him.

193
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:14,720
We were going to bring him in for the reward money, but we couldn't get a handle on him.

194
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,530
Geary and I split up, figured we didn't have a shot,but...

195
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:18,580
but what?

196
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:24,070
Well,after what happened,I'm starting to think maybe geary ran into ol' bagwell after all.

197
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,050
Right here in tribune?

198
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:31,000
Now,brad,do you think you could answer some questions

199
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,050
that might help us track theodore bagwell?

200
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,140
I'd be indebted.

201
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:39,210
I'll do whatever I can to help you nail that son of a bitch.

202
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:41,730
You think sara has this tape?

203
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:43,450
Government does.

204
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:49,280
I just saw her yesterday. If she does have anything,she doesn't know.

205
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:51,330
Well,where is she now?

206
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,120
I don't know.

207
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,840
Any way you can get in touch with her?

208
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,260
We brought cell phones. I could call her.

209
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:59,990
Please,please,please,bro, call her from panama.

210
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:01,290
Please.

211
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:04,530
We got less than two hours. I got to make the flight.

212
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:09,990
What?

213
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,020
Run. Run!

214
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:24,730
where's this car you keep talking about?

215
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:26,740
- It's over the ridge. - Give me that.

216
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:29,750
You guys head for the car! Go!

217
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:39,650
Come on!

218
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:49,490
Go!

219
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:51,890
Go back for him!

220
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,770
Dad! Go!

221
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,550
Come on,dad

222
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,000
We made it!

223
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:13,010
Son of a bitch! We made it!

224
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:21,300
Linc.

225
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:33,990
Sucre,get us to a hospital.

226
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:35,520
Out here? Where the hell am I going to find...?

227
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,530
Just get us to a hospital,please!

228
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:38,790
Okay.

229
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:40,340
Don't worry. You're going to make it.

230
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,650
It's bile.

231
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:44,530
He got me clean through.

232
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:46,220
You're going to be okay! Just...

233
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:47,770
hold on.

234
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:50,110
Listen to me,both of you.

235
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:53,870
I'm sorry.

236
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:56,290
I wish I had never left.

237
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:01,120
Don't talk,don't talk. Just breathe.

238
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:09,390
Okay,so do you want a pb & b?

239
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:12,540
Not really. My tummy hurts.

240
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:16,950
Where's her knapsack?

241
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:18,760
Her what?

242
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:21,390
Knapsack. Her medicine's in it.

243
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:23,580
I don't know,baby. I just grabbed her and ran.

244
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:26,620
She needs that medicine. She can't go two days without it.

245
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:28,980
Yeah,I know. I'm her father,all right?

246
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:31,510
Where is it?

247
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:33,540
Baby.Baby,look. Calm down.

248
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:34,490
What are you looking for?

249
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:36,940
Just tell me what it is,and I'll go ahead and get it,okay?

250
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:39,600
Her prescription.

251
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:42,770
It's a backup. I keep an extra,in case.

252
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,110
Okay. Okay.

253
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:50,610
so all we need to do is find a pharmacy.

254
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:56,450
Don't worry.

255
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,480
Hey,looks like we're going on a ride, sweet pea.

256
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:04,850
Look,we nail bagwell,he might still have some of geary's things on him,like his backpack,

257
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:07,960
which has his personal stuff in it. I know his wife would love to have it.

258
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:11,490
If we find bagwell,you can give it to her personally.

259
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:12,290
Thanks.

260
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:14,800
It's the least I can do considering ho you're helping me out.

261
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:18,200
Though some of the guys on the force are concerned about...

262
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:19,980
what are they concerned about?

263
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,950
Nothing.

264
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:23,770
But you know what?

265
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:25,950
Why don't you tell me what you know, we'll track down bagwell,

266
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:29,280
we'll get geary's effects back to his family, I'll make sure that everybody involved knows that

267
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,150
your help was invaluable.

268
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:35,120
I'll even recommend that you get most of, if not all of,that reward money.

269
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:39,300
What is it exactly that the guys on the force were concerned about?

270
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:45,430
Well,some of them thought that you weren't being totally upfront about your head injury.

271
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:48,460
I mean,to be fair,it does seem a little off

272
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:51,730
that you didn't see the guy who hit you smack-dab on the forehead.

273
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:57,850
You got me.

274
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:03,660
Geary and me had a little dustup over how to go about finding bagwell.

275
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:06,590
It got physical,and he hit me.

276
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:10,640
The two of us,we fought like brothers. I didn't want to rat him out to the cops.

277
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,630
After the fight,we split up.

278
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:17,280
And then...

279
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:22,130
Well,you know what happened to him.

280
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:26,260
I just wish to hell we'd never fought, you know?

281
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:28,390
Maybe then he'd still be...

282
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,420
brad,you can't blame yourself.

283
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:39,720
Why don't we refocus our energy on finng the man who killed your friend?

284
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:45,210
That's what roy would've wanted.

285
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:06,260
All right,baby.

286
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,470
Insurance card?

287
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:12,040
Uh,no,I don't have insurance.

288
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,750
You're paying for dexamethasone without insurance?

289
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:17,880
You got medicaid,medicare or something?

290
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:21,540
Nope. Um,I'll just pay cash.

291
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:23,860
It's $125.

292
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:37,050
Excuse me?

293
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:40,110
Excuse me?

294
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:43,940
Um,oh,sorry.

295
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:55,940
Sorry I don't have anything smaller.

296
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:00,390
I have to go to the back   to get change for $100.

297
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,590
So... I'll be right back.

298
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:16,560
- Right there! Hospital!    - I see it.

299
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:18,160
I see it. Just get us there.

300
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,360
No,you'll be caught.

301
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:21,110
Then we'll be caught.

302
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:24,210
I'm not gonna let you die.

303
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:25,720
Then listen to me.

304
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,340
You find sara tancredi.

305
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:31,390
She can end this.

306
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:35,540
It's up to you now.

307
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,270
yeah,I want an alarm out   on a dark blue sedan.

308
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,680
License: Ae9268.

309
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:53,450
40 miles southeast of los cruces.

310
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,530
Do it now.

311
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,970
oh,come on!

312
00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:03,300
What?

313
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:06,780
What hospital?

314
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:09,710
Docs called us in. He's in here.

315
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,210
We ran his name.

316
00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:15,380
Came back with two federal drug   smuggling warrants out on him.

317
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:19,070
Heard you wanted to talk to me.

318
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:25,420
I got some information the feds want...

319
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:28,900
about michael scofield.

320
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:34,740
Like where he's catching a ride.

321
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:37,100
And where would that be?

322
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:42,140
It's not just the where but the when.

323
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:45,770
That when is coming up soon.

324
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:49,690
But I want to cut a deal first.

325
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:54,420
Give us a minute.

326
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:22,330
Back then,

327
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,980
when things were at their worst...

328
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:29,770
there were days I thought   I'd never see the sun again.

329
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:32,840
But he saved my life.

330
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:40,160
I just wish he could have   let us be a part of his.

331
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:47,950
Yeah.

332
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,330
I'll tell him.

333
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:04,970
Here's the deal.

334
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:09,560
All charges dropped and the government picks up   medical costs until you're fit to be deported,

335
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:12,580
all contingent upon your   information being accurate.

336
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:16,590
Where's scofield?

337
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:20,520
No deportation. I want citizenship.

338
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,120
Citizenship?

339
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:27,480
A little incentive,and I want it in writing.

340
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:30,340
I'm so tired of playing games.

341
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:32,910
Well,start typing.

342
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:41,110
No external pacemaker.

343
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:45,110
Oh,this is a good one--   no morphine drip.

344
00:25:45,330 --> 00:25:46,410
What are you doing?

345
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:48,530
Fbi. Out. Out!

346
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:50,980
What the hell are you doing?

347
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:53,050
Giving you a little incentive.

348
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:56,220
Come on! Come on,you son of A...

349
00:25:56,530 --> 00:25:58,030
And they found nothing?

350
00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:00,350
Okay,thanks.

351
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:03,040
Well,your instincts are great,brad,

352
00:26:03,050 --> 00:26:05,640
but the precinct actually sent a   unit over to hollander's house today.

353
00:26:05,650 --> 00:26:09,030
An anonymous caller said they saw   an intruder but no one was there.

354
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:10,690
Damn it.

355
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:14,840
If you knew about bagwell and hollander,why   didn't you just head over there yourself?

356
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:18,020
We couldn't find the house.

357
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,410
Really? It's listed.

358
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:29,320
excuse me.

359
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,490
Thank you.

360
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:41,600
Everything okay?

361
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:44,720
Yeah,yeah,everything's fine.

362
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:50,100
Brad,have you ever been to the fauntleroy   hotel? It's about 15 minutes from here.

363
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:51,540
Never heard of it.

364
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:53,550
Well,that's strange,

365
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:56,430
'cause they found this   receipt in geary's hotel room.

366
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,970
It's from your credit card.

367
00:26:57,980 --> 00:27:00,520
THANK YOU FOR SHOPPING WITH US

368
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:03,660
I don't know how that got there.

369
00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:10,530
I think you're being evasive.

370
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:13,720
You should tell me   the truth,mr.Bellick.

371
00:27:13,730 --> 00:27:15,540
What happened to "brad"?

372
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:18,870
About seven years ago,I   got my first homicide case

373
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,410
a woman,pretty.   She was brutally attacked.

374
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:23,660
Animal boyfriend left her for dead,

375
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:26,190
but she was still breathing... barely.

376
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:30,210
But she punched into her cell   phone the killer's number,

377
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:32,790
so she solved the crime for us.

378
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:35,370
When we found the receipt,brad,

379
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:38,040
it was in geary's hand,his   finger pointing to your name.

380
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:40,470
With his last ounce of strength, he told us you killed him.

381
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,710
Okay,listen.

382
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:44,720
Geary and I found bagwell   at hollander's house.

383
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:50,040
We roughed him up till he told us where he'd hid   the five million bucks we knew he dug up in utah.

384
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:52,830
When we found the money, geary double-crossed me.

385
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:55,090
He hit me in the   head and took the cash.

386
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:56,760
I had nothing to do   with geary's death.

387
00:27:56,770 --> 00:27:58,080
You hear what I'm saying?

388
00:27:58,090 --> 00:28:01,740
I'm the victim here, not that son of a bitch!

389
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:14,020
Come on,come on,come on.

390
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:16,400
Where are you at,baby?

391
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,090
Hey,uh,could you hurry it up?

392
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:26,960
It's just it's getting really   late-- I got to get home.

393
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:36,780
And,um,that's $20,$40,

394
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:39,820
$50,and $20 is $70.

395
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:43,540
One,two,three,four,five......

396
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:45,850
seventy-five.

397
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,990
You got to be kidding me.

398
00:29:11,770 --> 00:29:13,030
Ma'am.

399
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,710
Afternoon,officer.

400
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:19,020
Do you have any id with you?

401
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,790
no.I walked over here,

402
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,490
so i didn't carry anything with me.

403
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:25,860
Did you? Where'd you walk from?

404
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:29,180
Is there a problem,officer?

405
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:31,660
There's only a problem if   you make one,ms. Franklin.

406
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:34,500
You want to tell us   where your husband is?

407
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:38,600
I don't know.

408
00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:41,610
Place your hands behind   your back,please,ma'am.

409
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:54,710
Baby,I'm so sorry.

410
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,730
Oh,my god.

411
00:30:14,290 --> 00:30:16,000
Where's mommy?

412
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:22,560
Mommy,uh,mommy is going   to meet us later. Okay?

413
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:31,110
- Yes.    - Where's the photo?

414
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:33,770
Bill,there was a tactical error.

415
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:36,980
I don't want terminology from the   cover your ass handbook,paul.

416
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:38,760
What happened?

417
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:42,110
There were unforeseen circumstances, things that could not be predicted.

418
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,840
Where's sara?

419
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:48,010
She's gone,isn't she?

420
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:53,990
Yes,she got away,

421
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,730
but there's no way that she could...

422
00:30:57,150 --> 00:30:58,840
bill.

423
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,460
I'm not going to let you die.

424
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:18,110
I love you.

425
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:22,790
You know that,don't you?

426
00:32:37,650 --> 00:32:39,300
Too many.

427
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:44,110
Too many people died because   I wanted you to be free.

428
00:32:44,970 --> 00:32:47,030
You couldn't have known,michael.

429
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:50,460
You couldn't have know it...   would have ended up like this.

430
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:52,390
But it did.

431
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,810
They wanted him.

432
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,380
They wanted him in the ground,

433
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:02,320
and they got their wish.

434
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:05,870
This thing is not going   to end here,michael.

435
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:10,630
- I know.    - It's going to keep spreading.

436
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:15,770
Their hands are going to   get more and more bloody.

437
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,980
Well,the question is,

438
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:22,300
is the blood on their   hands... or ours?

439
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:30,510
I'm sorry,guys.

440
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:32,970
We got to go.

441
00:33:52,090 --> 00:33:53,290
Get back on with border patrol.

442
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:55,520
Call the navy reserve   air station in dallas.

443
00:33:55,530 --> 00:33:56,730
They've got planes on alert.

444
00:33:56,740 --> 00:34:01,180
We need an intercept of a white,single   engine a-36 beech heading toward the border.

445
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:04,050
Call mexico,get clearance   for an international pursuit.

446
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:07,130
Tell them if they got to take   the plane down,just do it.

447
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:52,890
Come on,guys!

448
00:34:54,270 --> 00:34:55,760
Guys,come on.

449
00:34:55,770 --> 00:34:57,170
Come on,guys.

450
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:01,650
What?

451
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:05,470
We're staying.

452
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:08,560
- Ay,vamonos!    - Esperate,esperate,esperate.

453
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:14,070
Michael,this is what   we've been waiting for.

454
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:16,750
Maybe we'll see you   down there somewhere.

455
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:20,250
I can't talk you out   of this one,can i?

456
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:30,080
Well,I hope so.

457
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,970
Be good.

458
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:33,810
Thank you,michael.

459
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:35,640
Thank you for everything.

460
00:35:41,650 --> 00:35:44,250
- Take care,all right?     - I will.

461
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,630
Fly safe,papi.

462
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:51,360
Give 'em hell.

463
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:10,740
Panama would've been good.

464
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:12,320
Are you ready for this?

465
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:15,110
- Been waiting years.    - Good to hear it.

466
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,880
'Cause today is the   day we stop running.

467
00:36:30,970 --> 00:36:33,130
- What now?     - We go back to the car.

468
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:35,880
I drive to a border town, find a cell phone signal.

469
00:36:36,470 --> 00:36:37,970
Call sara.

470
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:52,360
Where the hell are those jets?

471
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:04,670
you hear that?

472
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,120
Yeah.

473
00:37:08,830 --> 00:37:10,300
Pull over.

474
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:24,700
oh,god,they're going after sucre.

475
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:27,700
They're gonna take him down.

476
00:37:28,330 --> 00:37:30,930
- How'd they find out?    - I don't know.

477
00:37:35,830 --> 00:37:37,220
Michael.

478
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,420
I want to know what   the hell's going on.

479
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:11,830
If you could've arrested me, you would've already done it.

480
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:12,590
I'm out of here.

481
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,460
Not really an option   for you,mr. Bellick.

482
00:38:14,470 --> 00:38:17,730
What do you got,a receipt? He left   it in his pocket. A fight? Big deal.

483
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:21,570
I got ten pals in chicago tell you   geary and i threw down once a month.

484
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:22,610
You're right.

485
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:25,350
Any of those things on their   own,probably not enough.

486
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:27,150
But when you add this...

487
00:38:27,490 --> 00:38:29,250
what the hell's that?

488
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,930
You left a message for mr. Geary.

489
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,320
You thieving son of a bitch,

490
00:38:35,330 --> 00:38:38,430
you better get down on your knees   and pray to god that I don't find you.

491
00:38:38,610 --> 00:38:40,680
Because if I do,mark my words:

492
00:38:40,690 --> 00:38:43,240
I'm gonna gut you bow to stern.

493
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,400
You want to hear it again?

494
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:55,510
Now at this juncture,brad,things will go a whole   lot easier for you if you admit to the crime.

495
00:38:55,790 --> 00:38:56,910
Now you listen to me,

496
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:59,790
you manipulative little bitch.

497
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:02,020
I did not kill roy geary!

498
00:39:02,030 --> 00:39:03,550
You understand what I'm telling you!

499
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:05,380
Bagwell set me up!

500
00:39:05,390 --> 00:39:06,790
Get your hds off of me!

501
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:10,370
Bradley bellick,you are under arrest for the   first-degree murder of roy william geary.

502
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:11,450
You have a right to remain silent.

503
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:13,840
Anything you say can be used   against you in a court of law.

504
00:39:13,850 --> 00:39:16,850
You have a right to talk with an attorney and to  have him present with you when being questioned.

505
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:18,800
If you cannot hire an attorney...

506
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:31,310
President reynolds' office.

507
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,710
This is agent paul kellerman.

508
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:35,410
I need to speak with the   president right now,please.

509
00:39:35,830 --> 00:39:38,780
I'm sorry,this administration isn't   familiar with an agent kellerman.

510
00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:40,360
June,it's me.

511
00:39:40,370 --> 00:39:43,250
I need to speak with caroline now.

512
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:45,210
June,if you don't put me through,

513
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:46,540
I'll make certain that the  president knows that

514
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:50,580
you were the one who did not allow me to  provide her with some very important information.

515
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:52,140
Now.

516
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:56,310
I'm sorry,this administration   isn't familiar with an agent...

517
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:11,660
Please leave a message after the tone.

518
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:13,620
bill,don't do thiS.

519
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:17,310
I've dedicated my life to   this country,to caroline.

520
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:19,390
Everything I have,I give.

521
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:23,060
Every photo,every file.   Get rid of it all.

522
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:24,790
Make him a ghost.

523
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,360
I've been a perfect soldier.

524
00:40:26,370 --> 00:40:29,010
I've never asked   anything of you,ever.

525
00:40:29,530 --> 00:40:31,480
But I'm asking now.

526
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,220
Bill,don't do thiS.

527
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,900
I don't see him.

528
00:40:40,910 --> 00:40:44,200
Trust me,we haven't lost him yet.

529
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:46,390
No Service..

530
00:40:48,830 --> 00:40:51,390
Connecting.. No Service..

531
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:53,730
Linc?

532
00:40:54,250 --> 00:40:56,250
- Stop the car.    - What?

533
00:40:56,330 --> 00:40:58,480
We got to stop the car.

534
00:41:04,450 --> 00:41:06,260
That's a radio tower over there.

535
00:41:06,270 --> 00:41:09,040
It must be picking up some   kind of analog signal.

536
00:41:09,650 --> 00:41:11,020
We got to get closer.

537
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,910
Turn around.

538
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:14,840
What about your  friend back there?

539
00:41:14,850 --> 00:41:16,440
If we're gonna go down,

540
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:19,440
might as well go down swinging.

541
00:41:30,050 --> 00:41:31,850
Come on,come on,come on...

542
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:34,990
Connecting 505-555-0162

543
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:38,710
we are in business.

544
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,240
it's going through.

545
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,290
Come on,sara,pick up.

546
00:42:08,730 --> 00:42:10,210
Sara?

547
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:34,610
Hello?

548
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:36,830
Hello? Michael?

549
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:38,820
Michael?
