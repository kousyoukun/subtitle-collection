1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:01,840
Previously on prison break

2
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:05,620
I want a presidential pardon for me and my brother.

3
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:07,780
You tell me what's going on-- I can take care of you.

4
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:11,630
All I need you to do is tell me exactly what agent mahone told you.

5
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:15,360
I have a job to do, which I've been made to do.

6
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:16,000
Get off the phone.

7
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:18,880
Wait.Wait.Stay right where you are.

8
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:33,390
What if I know where you can get at $5 million?

9
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:34,650
Where is it?

10
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:36,360
I could take you there, if you didn't have to

11
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,860
take me back to the states and turn me back in.

12
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:42,420
Free tickets, one cabin, one-way.Nice

13
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:44,450
Sir, in just a few minutes the presidenis

14
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:47,460
going to announce a pardon for burrows and scofield.

15
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:51,690
I regret to inform you, I am stepping down

16
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:55,130
as president of the united states.

17
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,820
There's only one thing we can do.

18
00:00:56,870 --> 00:01:00,300
We gotta disappear.Forever.

19
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:12,500
Mexico Benito Juarez International airport

20
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:16,480
aqui es to maleta, senor stammel.

21
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:18,480
Gracias.

22
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,550
it's very heavy.

23
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:37,580
What have you got in there?

24
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:40,400
About 75 pounds of none of your business, pedro.

25
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:42,000
For your troubles.

26
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,040
Go!Go!Go!

27
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,110
Please.T-bag.T-bag, please.

28
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:06,720
I need that money.

29
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:08,750
Andale, you son of a bitch.

30
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:13,650
Please, t-bag, I'm begging you.no

31
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,550
Chicago....

32
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:24,600
What time does the ship leave?

33
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,150
About ten minutes.

34
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,800
I can't believe we're running again.

35
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:29,930
It's different now, man.

36
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:31,330
You think so?Yeah.

37
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:32,360
We brought the bitch down.

38
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:33,950
She stepped down, linc.

39
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,160
Because of us.

40
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,740
Yet you're still wanted for murder.

41
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:40,400
When you came to fox river...

42
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:41,670
remember what you said?

43
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,400
You said, "I'm gonna break you out of here.

44
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,180
" I'm alive.You did that.

45
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:47,680
You want to look for the good you look there.

46
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:50,430
Come on, let's just finish what you started.

47
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:07,220
Reynolds shocked the country and the world today when she unexpectedly resigned

48
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:11,640
...of usa...

49
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:15,010
hello?

50
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,720
Hey, are you all right?

51
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,600
Yeah, I'm fine.I just heard about the president.

52
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,020
What, what does it mean?

53
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:22,250
It means it's time to go.

54
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:24,020
Okay...when?

55
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:26,050
Ten minutes.How far away are you?

56
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:26,960
Five.

57
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:31,340
Listen, sara, linc and I are on the ship.

58
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:32,900
This is it.

59
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:35,930
There's no turning bacnow, so, uh...

60
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,700
I know it's not what you wanted from your life,

61
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:42,970
but in case your interested, there is room for one more.

62
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:46,500
Michael scofield, you asking me to sail off into the sunset with you?

63
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:50,490
Well, it's more of a freighter, but, uh...yes.

64
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,990
I'll be there.I'll see you soon.

65
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,690
She's heading west on leadwell.

66
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,590
All right.

67
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:08,110
Stay on her, I'll be right there.

68
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:13,100
What the hell's this?

69
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:14,310
I tried, boss.

70
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:15,400
You saw how he just took off.

71
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:17,680
The only thing I'm seeing is an escaped con,

72
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,720
who's begging to be taken nort-ay.

73
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:23,530
Okay, look, maybe we could call the cab company

74
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,200
and find out where t-bag was dropped off.

75
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:27,390
Now, you're talking.I saw some phone...

76
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:32,480
what's it going to take for you to forget you ever found us?

77
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:35,300
There ain't enough pesos in tj.

78
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:37,670
You sure about that?

79
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:39,140
Go ahead, shoot.

80
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:40,940
But it might not be the best idea seeing as

81
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,800
how I'm the only one who knows where your chiquita's tied up.

82
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,690
Where is maricruz?

83
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,800
If I tell you, I'm as good as dead.

84
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:52,070
Of course if you shoot, so is she.

85
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:55,420
- You're bluffing me.- Am I?

86
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:00,090
Let me tell you in words you might be more familiar with.

87
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:04,380
She's in "the hole," with enough food and water to last about three weeks.

88
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:08,960
Any longer than that your sweet little plum's gonna dry up like a raisin.

89
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:10,700
If anything happens to her, so help me...

90
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:11,290
help you?

91
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:14,500
Way I see it, it's you who's gotta help me.

92
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:15,740
'Cause you ain't gettin' your hands on

93
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:19,220
that girl 'til I get my hands on that money.

94
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:22,240
Guess that makes us partners.

95
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,130
here we go.

96
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:31,540
She's not here.

97
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:16,890
yeah.

98
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:18,650
Sara, what's the matter?

99
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:20,870
The ship is leaving.

100
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:29,250
- Michael...- what's wrong?

101
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:37,900
- Sara.- I'm already on board.

102
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:41,960
I'm sorry, i must have just missed you.Where are you?

103
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:43,240
We're on deck.

104
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:47,660
Great.I'm on my way up.

105
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:51,400
Love you.

106
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:57,480
We good?

107
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:01,520
yeah.

108
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,600
son of a bitch.

109
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,840
Where is he?

110
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:32,680
I don't know.

111
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:33,210
No more games, sara.

112
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:34,560
You were on your way to see him.

113
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:35,460
No, I wasn'T.

114
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:38,870
You were just compelled to flee the custody of a federal agent?

115
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,480
I couldn't find her.

116
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:56,550
sara...we got to go back.

117
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:58,030
Michael, you can't there's nothing you can do.

118
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,380
There's always something you can do.

119
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:01,470
Not this time.

120
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,050
Not this time, man.

121
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:05,120
It's done.

122
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:07,240
I'm sorry.

123
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:09,510
scofieldr prison.

124
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:12,000
I just wanted a donut, sir.

125
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:14,970
Get her a donuT.

126
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,030
Can we get her a donut?

127
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:16,730
Get her a donut.

128
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:18,250
Get her a dozen donuts!

129
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:20,960
Look her up!

133
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:16,840
1 week later

134
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,960
Where the hell did you go, michael?

135
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,560
Sullins: So, where the hell is mahone?

136
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:02,210
I don't know, sir.

137
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:04,070
He's been mia for the last week or so.

138
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:06,960
You think he knows I've been barking up one of his trees.

139
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,580
Mr.Franklin, good afternoon.

140
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:11,560
This is richard sullins.

141
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,590
Director of internal affairs at the fbi.

142
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:17,360
Which means whenever one of our people does something wrong,

143
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:20,510
it's my job to make it right.

144
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:22,080
How right are we talking about?

145
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:26,040
Well, let's be clear, you are a convicted felon

146
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:27,710
who broke out of a state penitentiary,

147
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:28,880
there's only so much I can do.

148
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:30,740
Well, there's only so much I can say.

149
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:33,500
Now, I'm sorry if I seem a little bit skeptical.

150
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:35,160
But the last time a federal agent came up

151
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,070
in here offering me a deal, there was a string attached...

152
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:40,870
that I was supposed to put around my neck.

153
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:43,220
I've been authorized to, uh, offer you a reduced sentence

154
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:45,770
in exchange for your testimony against agent mahone,

155
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:48,010
instead of 18 years, you'll be looking at 18 months.

156
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:49,560
18 months?

157
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,540
Hey, you know what?

158
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:51,900
That man tried to kill mE.

159
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:54,160
So as soon as he finds out that I'm singing,

160
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,490
I probably won't even last 18 days.

161
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:59,390
Mr.Franklin...he threatened my family.

162
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,210
Now, I need to be out there protecting them.

163
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:06,580
So until you can offer me something like that...

164
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:09,800
I'm not testifying to a damn thing.

165
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:13,000
Guard!

166
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:16,720
Free man.

167
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,320
You and your family.

168
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:21,790
Witness protection, fresh start.

169
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:23,580
Clean record?

170
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:25,750
Spick-and-span.

171
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:32,970
You put that in writing and you got yoself a witness.

172
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:44,490
Sir?

173
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:48,490
I knocked, but...

174
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:51,790
you okay?

175
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:53,830
What does that look like to you?

176
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,270
There, right there.

177
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:56,450
Uh, it's a triangle.

178
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,440
Yeah, I thought so, too.

179
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:02,940
How about this?

180
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:04,400
Right there.

181
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:06,070
It's the mathematical symbol for pi.

182
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:09,260
314.I'm thinking date, area code.

183
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,630
314, that's missouri.

184
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:12,490
So you think scofield's there?

185
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:13,190
I doubt it.

186
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:15,240
How's your greek alphabet, agent lang?

187
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:16,010
I don't know.

188
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:18,460
I guess it'S...

189
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:23,390
what if I told you that triangle was a delta and that this,

190
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:27,150
this here was not the symbol pi but the letter?

191
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:29,520
I didn't see any of those in the photos of the tattoos.

192
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,750
They weren't in the tattoos.

193
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:34,050
We pulled these from his original sketches off the hard drive.

194
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:38,430
Scofield numbered all of the steps of his escape.

195
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:39,710
It's how he kept everything in order,

196
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:41,300
but it looks like that he didn't use numbers,

197
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:44,440
that he used letters like, um...

198
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:46,870
a sketch of this tattoo.

199
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:50,360
Allan schweitzer marked with an alpha, first letter of the greek alphabet.

200
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:51,680
First step of his plan.

201
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,970
Epsilon, fifth letter of the greek alphabet.

202
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:55,100
Fifth step in his plan.

203
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:58,300
Here's theta, and kappa...

204
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,270
how about that?Tau?

205
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:00,610
At the border, right?

206
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,240
Getting closer to the end now; you with me?

207
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:03,540
So you think...

208
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:05,080
his omega...

209
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,440
the last letter of the greek alphabet.

210
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:08,750
Is the last step of his plan.

211
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,490
What is that?

212
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,640
Christ in a flower?

213
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:14,470
A rose.

214
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:15,700
And these numbers-- 617.

215
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,130
Could be biblical; chapter 6, verse 17.

216
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:21,380
6-1-7, 617.June 17th.

217
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:23,110
Oh, what's today?

218
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:24,220
The 15th.

219
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:27,740
- So whatever his last step is...
- it's going to happen in two days.

220
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:31,690
Mexico....

221
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:34,690
No.

222
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,060
There is Mr.stammel in our system.

223
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:39,770
You should ******rental...

224
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:41,650
What's he saying?Nothing.

225
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,940
The same as the rest.

226
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:44,550
Maybe he don't comprende.

227
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:46,180
What's spanish for "ins"?

228
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:47,000
Don't be stupid.

229
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:48,150
We're in mexico.

230
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:49,320
You're the illegal one here.

231
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:51,210
Hey, it doesn't mean he ain't got family up north

232
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,960
trying to clean their way to a green card.

233
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:54,220
He knows what I'm talking about.

234
00:13:56,450 --> 00:13:58,640
I hate this gringo...

235
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:01,280
but i need him

236
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:04,130
My girl *****too.

237
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:06,280
The ****for...

238
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:08,350

239
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:11,690

I****grateful

243
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:28,560
Mexico...

244
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:35,840
oh, you are too good to me, suzi-Q.

245
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:41,510
Mm.Just how I like it.

246
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:46,270
How did I get so lucky?

247
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:48,540
Oh, no, teddy bear.

248
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:51,110
I'm the lucky one.

249
00:14:54,660 --> 00:15:02,300
The day I met you...was the day I was born.

250
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:06,420
Mm.we're out of time.

251
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:11,470
No, susan, we got our whole lives together.

252
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:14,140
No, I mean, the hour is up.

253
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,180
I'll take care of you plenty, okay?

254
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:19,180
And since we're rolling here, so let's, you know, get back...

255
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,290
how's it-- what's cookin', good lookin'?

256
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:23,580
I would really feel better if you paid me up front.

257
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:26,410
And I told you up front that if you did this right,

258
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:29,030
I uld take care of you, so...

259
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,530
you paid me for an hour.

260
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:34,440
The hour is up.

261
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:37,190
If you want me to stay, I need more money.

262
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:40,580
great, great, you ruined it.Thanks.

263
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:44,040
You know, for a second there, I was actually like,

264
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:46,410
"this chick has a brain in her head.

265
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:49,930
" Then, if you did, you wouldn't be a street whore, right?

266
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:54,090
You know, I don't know who this suzi-q bitch is,

267
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,900
but no wonder she wants nothing to do with you.

268
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:02,540
You didn't just call her a bitch, did you?

269
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:06,510
Okay.I am going to count to three,

270
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:10,530
and if you don't put your arm down, I'm going to scream.

271
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:15,430
One, T...

272
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:39,480
Cristobal...

273
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:49,160
we made it.Not yet.

274
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:53,160
First there's someone we need to see.

275
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,410
Mahone: Okay, who's got what?

276
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:02,540
Christ as a rose is a pretty common theme that runs through the bible.

277
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:04,360
Martin luther adopted it as his coat of arms.

278
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:06,660
And there's the belief that christ rose from the dead.

279
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:09,870
This is scofield's final step, a new life.

280
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:11,560
Life.Could be something there.

281
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:13,690
You...keep track of this on the board.

282
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,450
On the board.

283
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:16,660
Where's wheeler?

284
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:17,620
Here we go.

285
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,510
The harmonists-- first settlers of new harmony,

286
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:22,510
indiana-- used a golden rose as their symbol for christ.

287
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,990
That's a reach.

288
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:25,630
There's a flower called the christmas rose.

289
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:28,290
Wasn't "christ rose" a rman code name for, uh,

290
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:31,160
the counterattack by the nazis that led to the battle of the bulge?

291
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:32,540
Where was that?

292
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:36,250
Ardennes forest on the belgium-germany border.

293
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:39,160
Yeah, not a bad place to hide if they can find it.

294
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:40,480
So you gonna look into that?

295
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,560
Yeah.All right, what else?

296
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:45,020
Christ actually rose from the dead on easter.

297
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:46,600
Easter sunday...

298
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:57,570
who's got scofield's file?

299
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:59,740
Um, here we go.

300
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:13,540
Here.Christ in a rose.

301
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:14,330
Yeah, what about it?

302
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,710
Scofield's mother's name.

303
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:20,360
christina rose scofield.

304
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:22,100
Hmm, but I thought she was dead.

305
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:27,640
Well, so did I.So did I.

306
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,710
the very first thing that scofield did

307
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:32,680
when they broke out of fox river is he picked up

308
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:35,010
a bunch of supplies that he had stashed in a grave.

309
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:37,780
I want you to find out where scofield's mother's buried.

310
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:39,530
And what?

311
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:41,580
And see if she's buried.

312
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:42,790
Yes, sir.

313
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:44,100
What about panama?

314
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:44,820
What about panama?

315
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:46,020
Well, when we found his hard drive,

316
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:47,770
it was full of information about central america,

317
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:48,930
panama in particular.

318
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:50,080
Which he knows you have.

319
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,690
The guy's got all kinds of hubris,

320
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,370
but he's smart enough to stay out of a country

321
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,210
where he knows you'll be waiting for him.

322
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:57,730
Unless there's something there that he needs.

323
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,690
Or someone.

324
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:03,410
I want a map of panama, and find out if scofield's mom,

325
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:06,640
christina rose, has any family in central america,

326
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:09,080
any property, anything.

327
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:22,110
The last time I was on a bus like this,

328
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:23,880
I was heading to fox river.

329
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,670
This country's amazing.

330
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:27,580
It's beautiful.

331
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:29,500
What's that smell, man?

332
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:31,200
Bananas.

333
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:32,210
And sugar cane.

334
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,470
That's panama's biggest exports.

335
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,670
Come on.

336
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:37,890
You've been talking about panama and bumpy bus rides

337
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,680
ever since we broke out, and now that we're actually doing it...

338
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:42,720
she should have been here with us.

339
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:45,450
We got all the time in the world for that.

340
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,660
Some ways down the track, you and sara...

341
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:49,210
can we just get there, please?

342
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:53,930
Sure.

343
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:56,520
oye!Tipo!Espera!

344
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:03,560
So far, no hits on any connection between

345
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:05,430
scofield's mother and panama.

346
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:07,590
But there are 38 listings of christina rose

347
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:09,650
in various combinations of first name,

348
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:10,680
middle name and last name.

349
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,110
All right, cross-reference the names with

350
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:13,820
the numbers 6-1-7 from the tattoo.

351
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:14,910
Maybe it's not a date.

352
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,380
See if it's an address, P.O.Box.

353
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:17,130
Got it.

354
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,530
If anybody pops, call the embassy,

355
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:21,570
have them send an officer to pick up the woman for questioning.

356
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:25,100
Um, I don't think we can just arrest a foreign citizen without any...

357
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:26,340
patriot act, agent lang.

358
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:28,690
I could arrest your grandmother for missing a stitch in her macram?

359
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:29,210
if I wanted to.

360
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:33,130
If anybody's helping scofield, dead or alive, I want to know who they are.

361
00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:44,980
- That her? - Yeah.

362
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:53,680
Hola, mrs.Vasquez.

363
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:55,110
You're late.

364
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:57,130
It's much later than the date you said.

365
00:21:57,170 --> 00:21:59,870
Well, we ran into a little bit of trouble.

366
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:01,750
Who is this?

367
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:05,440
It's a business associate.

368
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:07,510
Christina rose.

369
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:08,940
I remember.

370
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:10,750
You will find her here.

371
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:11,950
Buena suerte.

372
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:14,470
Gracias.

373
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:19,590
Oh, um...I'll meet you outside.

374
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:21,470
I forgot to ask something.

375
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:23,370
All right.

376
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:30,620
Do you have a phone I uld use?

377
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:40,200
Yes, uh, I need an international operator, please.

378
00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:42,350
United states.

379
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:46,560
It's, uh, 312-346...

380
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:47,720
what the hell are you doing?

381
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:48,760
Making a phone call.

382
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:50,530
You can'T.

383
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:52,430
We don't even know if she's alive or dead, linc.

384
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:55,260
If sara's in custody, they got her phone.

385
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:58,690
You want to get caught?

386
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:15,870
yeah.

387
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:17,550
Three things I hate, alex.

388
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:21,780
Traffic, hockey...and calling you with the same question over and over.

389
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:22,950
Well, then don't call me anymore,

390
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:25,130
but I do believe the brothers are in panama.

391
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:26,150
Is that so?

392
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,550
The key to exactly where is on one of scofield's tattoos.

393
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:31,640
While I'm thrilled you've narrowed it down to a country,

394
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:33,820
that's not why we're talking.

395
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:36,040
Benjamin miles franklin is alive...

396
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:37,590
I'm aware of that, yeah....

397
00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:40,530
And being released from custody.

398
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:41,470
That's not possible.

399
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,380
They would need permission from my office.

400
00:23:43,410 --> 00:23:45,690
Good to know you're on top of things.

401
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,950
Find me agent wheeler.

402
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,790
He'll see you now.

403
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,690
Forgive me for asking, sir, but...

404
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:18,360
couldn't we be doing this in my office?

405
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:20,900
It'd be much more comfortable.

406
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:25,370
I felt we needed to speak freely.

407
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:33,090
refer to as a "blind spot.

408
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:36,490
" Something to do with the position of the sun, I'm told.

409
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:40,320
Disrupts long-distance recording devices.

410
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:44,990
If I may apologize again, sir, for...

411
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,050
the unfortunate outcome with the president.

412
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,580
I know how important she was to our interests,

413
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:50,640
and I assure you that moving forward, I'll...

414
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:55,920
you won't be moving anywhere until you can explain to me how this happened.

415
00:24:58,290 --> 00:25:03,490
- The brothers...they're making it...
- still alive.

416
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:08,940
Yes.

417
00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:10,750
It appears they were able to flee the country.

418
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:12,190
To where?

419
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:15,250
Mr.Mahone seems to believe theyre in panama.

420
00:25:22,370 --> 00:25:27,160
Does our mr.Mahone know where exactly in panama they are?

421
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:30,650
- Not yet.Why?

422
00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:34,140
How much do you know about sona, mr.Kim?

423
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,360
Only what I've been given clearance on.

424
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:42,240
Perhaps what our situation requires...is a change in strategy.

425
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,030
How long until the court approves the arrest warrant for mahone?

426
00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:50,990
Should be anytime now.

427
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:53,120
We're just waiting for the indictment to come down.

428
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:54,780
Okay, well, I've got a question for you.

429
00:25:54,810 --> 00:25:56,070
What if he's in there?

430
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:57,670
I can't keep avoiding him.

431
00:25:57,710 --> 00:25:59,020
He reads people.

432
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:00,200
That's what he does.

433
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:01,990
And if he finds out that I'm involved in this,

434
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:03,100
I'm gonna need some protection from...

435
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:05,050
wheeler, relax.

436
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:06,560
Take a breath.

437
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,800
The only thing mahone can read is what you write for him.

438
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:10,180
Can you act normal?

439
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,300
That's all you have to do--

440
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:13,950
the last thing we want is for him to get spooked and take off.

441
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:15,590
This is all gonna be over soon.

442
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:17,790
All right.Thank you.

443
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:20,620
No.Thank you.

444
00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:31,380
Wheeler.Where you been?

445
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:40,030
I got to do this.

446
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,240
What are you doing, alex?

447
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:44,260
I'm not wearing a wire.

448
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:46,430
You gonna tell me what's going on here?

449
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:52,790
In old england...the punishment for a traitorous act was beheading.

450
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:55,180
Following the execution,

451
00:26:55,210 --> 00:26:57,510
they would hold up the severed head by the hair--

452
00:26:57,530 --> 00:26:59,500
not, as most people think, for the crowd to see the head,

453
00:26:59,530 --> 00:27:02,200
but for the head to see the crowd, because...

454
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:04,370
consciousness sticks around for another eight seconds.

455
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:06,220
The idea was that it would give the traitor

456
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:07,640
one more chance to take a look at...

457
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,640
you don't want to do this, okay?

458
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:10,530
Just take a moment...

459
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,450
if you're gonna stab me in the back,

460
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,760
agent wheeler, be smart enough to cover up the knife.

461
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:17,910
You go and visit franklin three times this week,

462
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:20,360
called sullins, what, twice a day?

463
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:22,660
Didn't you learn anything working for me?

464
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:25,890
You got to cover your tracks, unless you...

465
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:32,500
unless you want to get caught.

466
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:38,060
You wanted me to know it was you.

467
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,930
You're a killer, alex.

468
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:44,150
Is that so?

469
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:46,680
Soil samples taken from your yard in connection with

470
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:48,560
the disappearance of oscar shales.

471
00:27:48,610 --> 00:27:51,090
Forensics is prepared to submit a report detailing

472
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:54,320
the irregularities in the shooting of david "tweener" apolskis.

473
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:57,040
There's your blatant disregard for protocol

474
00:27:57,070 --> 00:27:57,970
in the death of john abruzzi...

475
00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:01,390
and the escaped con who says that I told him to kill himself.

476
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:06,800
You think his testimony is gonna send you into the promised land.

477
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:11,880
You can erase me, too.

478
00:28:11,930 --> 00:28:14,510
But it's not gonna erase the very real fact that

479
00:28:14,530 --> 00:28:17,470
you're gonna spend the rest of your life in prison.

480
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:26,390
You know...you remind me of myself when I was a young agent.

481
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,800
What?

482
00:28:29,090 --> 00:28:32,160
I wish I could take that as a compliment.

483
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:35,800
That's some real fine work, wheeler.

484
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:37,700
Good job.

485
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:40,980
Don't you let anyone scare you...

486
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:43,840
into doing the wrong thing.

487
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,890
Let me take you in.

488
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:51,550
Whatever mess you're in, we can clean it up.

489
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:55,510
There's only one way to clean this-- one way.

490
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:04,910
Hey.Got a visitor.

491
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:05,970
Yeah, who?

492
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:07,260
I don't know.

493
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:08,480
I was just instructed to bring you down.

494
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,160
Hey, look, I ain't going nowhere until

495
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:13,240
you tell me who it is I'm meeting, all right?

496
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:14,960
You got to stop it.

497
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:16,540
Listen to me for a second, all right?

498
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:18,790
That's all you got to do is go out there and check.

499
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:20,750
Guy's kind of tall, okay?

500
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:22,870
It's the least that you can do.

501
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:25,300
Huh?

502
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:29,680
what?

503
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:32,600
Daddy!Oh, my god.

504
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,190
Come here.

505
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:38,350
Oh.Oh, daddy loves you so much.

506
00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:52,070
so, um...is it real?

507
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:57,010
He says you're gonna go free, that we don't have to run anymore.

508
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:57,910
I mean, what happened?

509
00:29:57,950 --> 00:29:59,280
What changed?

510
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,720
Don't you worry about it.

511
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:04,020
You just know that your man handles things.

512
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:05,720
Ain't that right?

513
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:07,140
That's right.

514
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:11,070
Okay.I don't believe it, But okay.

515
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:14,530
Benjamin, if I could just have a quick word.

516
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,470
Uh...yeah.

517
00:30:20,010 --> 00:30:22,890
Why don't you go down the hall for just a quick second.

518
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:25,560
Okay?I'll be right there.

519
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:32,310
Here it is.

520
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:34,630
New address, new identities.

521
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,740
Now, the prosecutor's gonna be getting in touch with

522
00:30:36,770 --> 00:30:39,030
you to go over your testimony, so you just make sure you show up

523
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:41,280
where he says and when he says.

524
00:30:41,330 --> 00:30:43,470
Yeah, okay, okay.

525
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:45,850
But I'm a free man, right?

526
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:47,870
Free man.

527
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,430
Wait a minute.

528
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:53,880
What about mahone, you know?

529
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:55,300
'Cause I don't want to be looking over my shoulder

530
00:30:55,330 --> 00:30:56,800
for the rest of my life, you feel me?

531
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:58,440
You let me worry about mahone.

532
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,330
You just worry about staying out of trouble.

533
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:03,510
You ain't gonna have a problem with that, trust me.

534
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,690
Don't screw it up.

535
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:28,270
How much further?

536
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:30,090
Not far.

537
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:34,330
You know, for what it's worth, no one forced sara to do what she did.

538
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,730
Whatever gets you through the night.

539
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:39,050
The hell does that mean?

540
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,170
I didn't ask you to use her.

541
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:41,830
It's not that simple.

542
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:43,350
Whatever gets you through the night, buddy.

543
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:45,830
You know what amazes me, linc?

544
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:49,380
Nothing ever registers with you.Ever.

545
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:51,770
Just rolls right off your back, doesn't it?

546
00:31:51,810 --> 00:31:54,700
We ruined sara's life and it's like you don't even care.

547
00:31:54,730 --> 00:31:55,550
That what you think?

548
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,760
Well, we're here, and sara's back there in prison.

549
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:58,760
Does that seem fair to you?

550
00:31:58,790 --> 00:31:59,540
None of it's fair.

551
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:01,120
Just don't make this about boy loses girl.

552
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:02,500
Who should it be about, linc?

553
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:03,880
Westmoreland?

554
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:05,380
Tweener?Lj?Lj's mom?

555
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,570
Let me stop you right there.

556
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:08,350
Remember the name of the guard that was murdered

557
00:32:08,370 --> 00:32:09,700
because of the riot I started?

558
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:10,450
Shut up, michael.

559
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,190
Do you even remember his name?

560
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,410
I bet you remember veronica's name though, don't you?

561
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:16,090
You mention her name again, I swear to god...

562
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:16,940
What about t-bag?

563
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:18,910
Linc, he's out there, now, because of us!

564
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,120
You and me!

565
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:29,540
Every life he takes, that's blood on our hands.

566
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:32,020
And for what?

567
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:36,110
I didn't ask you to do what you did.

568
00:32:36,770 --> 00:32:38,350
They were gonna kill you, linc!

569
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:40,830
Well, maybe you should've let them!

570
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:43,750
Take that back.

571
00:33:09,930 --> 00:33:14,210
as bad as i feel about sara, she had a choice.

572
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:16,680
Veronica didn'T.

573
00:33:19,890 --> 00:33:22,100
I listened to her die, michael.

574
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:25,740
I listened to her die, and there was...there was nothing I could do.

575
00:33:25,890 --> 00:33:27,380
Nothing.

576
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:35,140
we've lost so much, man.

577
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:39,420
We can't afford to lose each other.

578
00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:42,430
We just can'T.

579
00:34:08,970 --> 00:34:11,250
you going somewhere, alex?

580
00:34:11,290 --> 00:34:13,130
I don't know.Am I?

581
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:14,920
come on.

582
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,500
You know i don't like to get my hands dirty.

583
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:28,670
It's surprising the things a man will do when properly motivated.

584
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:33,130
Wasn't it you who told me that?

585
00:34:33,950 --> 00:34:35,540
You know, I would kill you right now if

586
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:38,330
I thought it would give me an ounce of peace.

587
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:43,200
And what would give you peace?

588
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:47,280
I've been able to hold it together through all this...

589
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:51,120
because there was a light at the end of the tunnel.

590
00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:57,040
Life...at the end of the tunnel, for me, for my family.

591
00:34:57,070 --> 00:34:58,810
And now what?

592
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:00,620
Do you see my son?

593
00:35:00,650 --> 00:35:03,010
Do you see my wife?

594
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:04,220
What have I got?

595
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:05,960
What have you given me?

596
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:10,070
What if I was to tell you that there was something

597
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:14,670
that could turn that light...back on?

598
00:35:14,970 --> 00:35:15,990
What would you say?

599
00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:17,310
I'd say that's the same offer you made

600
00:35:17,350 --> 00:35:19,890
when you dragged me into this, you little bastard.

601
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:21,310
And look where it's got me now.

602
00:35:21,350 --> 00:35:23,020
They're gonna drag me before the public.

603
00:35:23,050 --> 00:35:24,890
They've gonna prosecute me like-like...

604
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:26,420
like some kind of murderer.

605
00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:28,160
There's-there'S...there's evidence.

606
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:31,650
Really hard, tangible evidence, that you can't take away.

607
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,830
You're right...

608
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:37,080
but I can help you get away.

609
00:35:37,090 --> 00:35:41,040
And at this point, I don't think you've got any other options.

610
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:48,570
Theodore "t-bag" bagwell was apprehended in mexico.

611
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:49,700
Oh, let me guess.

612
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:50,590
You want him dead.

613
00:35:50,610 --> 00:35:57,040
Oh, no.There's been a, uh, change in strategy.

614
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:59,150
We're gonna need him alive.

615
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:03,100
I'm talking about a very real finish line here, alex.

616
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:05,460
You've come so far.

617
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,790
How much further would I have to go?

618
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:11,150
Well, you're lucky.

619
00:36:11,570 --> 00:36:14,530
For this, you only have to go to panama.

620
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:24,030
I'm trying to remember the last time our lives made any kind of sense.

621
00:36:27,170 --> 00:36:29,120
Before mom died.

622
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:31,380
When it was just the three of us.

623
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:37,000
Well, there she is.

624
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:46,040
hello, lang.

625
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:46,790
What's going on?

626
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:49,810
I mean, there's all kinds of suits over here going through your office.

627
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,910
I'll explain later.

628
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:53,530
All right.

629
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:55,700
Um...did you get the fax?

630
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:57,320
No.Why?

631
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:58,420
What do you got?

632
00:36:58,450 --> 00:37:01,420
Some information on christina rose you might find interesting.

633
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,290
Looks like she was commissioned about four months

634
00:37:03,330 --> 00:37:06,040
before scofield robbed that bank by a builder

635
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:08,400
in panama named amparo vasquez.

636
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:10,480
Son of a bitch.

637
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,230
She's beautiful.

638
00:37:22,270 --> 00:37:24,600
Yeah, she's not the real thing, but...

639
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:26,270
so where to, man?

640
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:28,460
Anywhere we want.

641
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:35,810
So, it really over?

642
00:37:35,870 --> 00:37:38,310
Yeah, baby, it's really oveR.

643
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:40,140
Okay.

644
00:37:52,010 --> 00:37:56,850
what is it, baby?Huh?

645
00:37:59,530 --> 00:38:02,160
Oh, nothing.

646
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:04,970
Let's go home.

647
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:19,490
sucre: Okay, so we checked the train station in malinalco,

648
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:24,880
the-the bus depot in puebla, and just about every hotel there is.

649
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:29,050
hello.Hey, hey, hey, slow down, sancho.

650
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,130
Uno momento.

651
00:38:31,170 --> 00:38:32,860
It's for you.

652
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:36,570
Hola.S?

653
00:38:41,850 --> 00:38:43,660
that was the guy from the tourism bureau.

654
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:44,560
He found him.

655
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:45,790
Where?

656
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:49,450
An e.Stammel just boarded a plane to panama city.

657
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:51,890
What the hell's he doing in panama?

658
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:17,660
You speak english?

659
00:39:18,650 --> 00:39:21,460
Say, uh, "good morning, teddy.

660
00:39:21,810 --> 00:39:23,290
Good morning, teddy.

661
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:26,220
So then, actually, no, you don't speak english.

662
00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:28,520
Hablan ingles around here?

663
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,990
say, "good morning, teddy.

664
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:42,090
Good morning, teddy.

665
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:46,540
Say, "good morning, teddy bear.

666
00:39:46,570 --> 00:39:49,210
" Good morning, teddy bear.

667
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:51,930
Do you like wigs?

668
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:55,680
for the right money, I like anything.

669
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:33,770
Oh.There's nothing.

670
00:40:33,790 --> 00:40:35,780
Nothing online about sara's arrest.

671
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,400
Maybe they're keeping it quiet.

672
00:40:37,430 --> 00:40:38,250
What about the message board?

673
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:40,290
The goldfinch thing?

674
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:43,400
Just something from c-note and...

675
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,950
There is a message from sucre.

676
00:40:45,990 --> 00:40:48,240
Still running, huh?

677
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:52,240
What?

678
00:40:54,770 --> 00:40:58,800
sucre says t-bag's here, in panama.

679
00:40:58,820 --> 00:41:00,580
How the hell does he know?

680
00:41:00,590 --> 00:41:01,590
I don't know.

681
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:03,220
It says, "the bag's still has the bag.

682
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:05,680
"He's in panama city at the fin del camino hotel.

683
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:08,010
"If you're there and want to help put that bird back in a cage,

684
00:41:08,050 --> 00:41:08,790
let me know.

685
00:41:08,830 --> 00:41:10,380
Sucre.

686
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,620
" What the hell is that son of a bitch doing in panama?

687
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:13,400
We got to go after him.

688
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:14,380
Just let it be, man.

689
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,420
We don't need the money.

690
00:41:15,430 --> 00:41:17,270
It's not about the money, linc.

691
00:41:17,310 --> 00:41:18,930
Whatever good we do from here on out,

692
00:41:18,970 --> 00:41:21,040
it doesn't matter as long as t-bag's out there.

693
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:21,730
Michael, we made it.

694
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:22,820
Too much has gone wrong.

695
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:27,370
If we could just...if we could just make this right.

696
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:30,050
Panama city, is only an hour away.

697
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:31,560
And now we know where he's staying.

698
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:33,110
So call the police.

699
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:34,570
There's a reason I chose panama--

700
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:36,520
there's no extradition laws.

701
00:41:36,550 --> 00:41:38,220
They're not going to touch him.

702
00:41:38,270 --> 00:41:40,280
So what are you gonna do?

703
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,250
I'll figure something out.

704
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:42,940
Figure it out?

705
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:45,470
You don't take a piss without a plan, man.Come on.

706
00:41:45,490 --> 00:41:46,000
Look at me--

707
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:48,510
I never think things through and look where it got me.

708
00:41:48,530 --> 00:41:50,210
Yeah, panama and a boat-load of booze.

709
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:50,890
You got me that.

710
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:52,390
I got me a death sentence.

711
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:53,920
Look, let's just...

712
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:57,410
get out to sea, think things through,

713
00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:03,190
when the time's right, we make it right.Okay?

714
00:42:07,770 --> 00:42:10,920
I'm in.Let me know when you get there.Michael

715
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:23,360
I'll be there tomorrow see you then.Sucre

716
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:26,930
Trans panamanian airlines, flight 271 to panama,

717
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:29,550
now boarding all first class passengers.

718
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:32,780
Again, we are now boarding for panama city.

719
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:35,100
See you soon.

720
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:40,670
Home sweet home.

721
00:42:45,790 --> 00:42:48,690
I got the booze, but the limes are shot.

722
00:42:54,110 --> 00:42:56,660
Michael?!

723
00:42:57,980 --> 00:43:02,470
Michael!Michael!

724
00:43:02,530 --> 00:43:05,360


725
00:43:05,450 --> 00:43:07,180
