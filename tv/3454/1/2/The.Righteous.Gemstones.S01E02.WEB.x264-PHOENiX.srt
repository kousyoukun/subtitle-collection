1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:03,015
I am sure the congregation, the media,

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,992
your family, would love
to see you enjoying yourself.

3
00:00:08,166 --> 00:00:10,265
One million dollars.

4
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:13,100
Jesse, what in God's name?

5
00:00:13,125 --> 00:00:14,219
I'm being blackmailed.

6
00:00:14,243 --> 00:00:15,851
Somebody sent me this video.
They said they're gonna leak

7
00:00:15,875 --> 00:00:17,343
the whole damn thing unless I pay them

8
00:00:17,367 --> 00:00:19,170
a million dollars by Sunday.

9
00:00:19,195 --> 00:00:21,542
Johnny Seasons thinks he's a big shot.

10
00:00:21,567 --> 00:00:22,892
What do you got to say to me?

11
00:00:22,917 --> 00:00:26,283
Gemstones are an absolute
disgrace to all ministries.

12
00:00:26,308 --> 00:00:28,725
I finally figured out
who the blackmailer is.

13
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:30,553
- Who?
- Johnny Seasons.

14
00:00:30,578 --> 00:00:32,233
We're gonna ambush him at his house.

15
00:00:32,257 --> 00:00:34,060
Get him while his guard's down,
overpower him,

16
00:00:34,085 --> 00:00:35,725
and get him to give us that damn tape.

17
00:00:37,208 --> 00:00:38,537
Had enough of me?!

18
00:00:38,562 --> 00:00:40,558
This is the downfall of the Gemstones.

19
00:00:40,583 --> 00:00:42,433
I'm supposed to make the drop at ten.

20
00:00:42,458 --> 00:00:43,972
Then pay him, Jesse.

21
00:00:43,996 --> 00:00:46,132
I don't have the money, Judy!

22
00:00:49,192 --> 00:00:50,275
Get in.

23
00:00:50,714 --> 00:00:51,906
I love you guys.

24
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:02,974
I think the biggest
misconception about Thailand

25
00:01:02,999 --> 00:01:06,359
is that it's gonna all
be about the ladyboys,

26
00:01:06,384 --> 00:01:08,433
like they're just gonna be everywhere

27
00:01:08,458 --> 00:01:11,725
hanging out of windows with
their cocks in their panties.

28
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:13,787
But it's not, okay?

29
00:01:13,812 --> 00:01:15,541
The food, no joke.

30
00:01:15,566 --> 00:01:17,359
Beaches are unreal.

31
00:01:17,903 --> 00:01:19,725
And we're gonna be
taller than everybody.

32
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:20,906
He's here.

33
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,708
Oh, fuck. Here we go.

34
00:01:25,126 --> 00:01:27,710
Wait a minute. He's not alone.

35
00:01:27,735 --> 00:01:29,875
Jesus, that wasn't part of the deal.

36
00:01:35,323 --> 00:01:37,509
- Who's in the car?
- Nobodies.

37
00:01:37,534 --> 00:01:38,886
My brother and sister.

38
00:01:38,911 --> 00:01:40,808
Tell them to get the fuck out!

39
00:01:49,722 --> 00:01:50,781
Hi.

40
00:01:51,169 --> 00:01:52,566
Assholes.

41
00:01:54,374 --> 00:01:56,582
Walk slowly to the rear of the van

42
00:01:56,607 --> 00:01:58,148
and place the bags on the ground.

43
00:01:58,173 --> 00:01:59,933
I don't really feel
comfortable doing that.

44
00:01:59,958 --> 00:02:01,142
I don't know who y'all got back there,

45
00:02:01,166 --> 00:02:02,975
so I'm just gonna put
the bags right down here.

46
00:02:02,999 --> 00:02:04,916
No, bring 'em to where I told you.

47
00:02:09,886 --> 00:02:11,331
Baby, I don't like this. Let's go.

48
00:02:11,356 --> 00:02:12,730
Fucking asshole.

49
00:02:12,755 --> 00:02:14,753
He wants to be a big shot.

50
00:02:15,604 --> 00:02:16,783
I got this.

51
00:02:16,808 --> 00:02:18,667
What? No, no, no.
Don't get out of the car.

52
00:02:18,692 --> 00:02:20,408
- God damn it, Scotty!
- Scott, Scott.

53
00:02:20,433 --> 00:02:21,892
Oh, fuck. Shit.

54
00:02:25,489 --> 00:02:27,011
What's happening now?

55
00:02:27,036 --> 00:02:28,808
He's handing him the thumb drive.

56
00:02:31,794 --> 00:02:33,892
- And now he's air-fucking.
- Ugh.

57
00:02:33,917 --> 00:02:35,642
I hate when he air-fucks.

58
00:02:36,182 --> 00:02:38,112
Oh, shit.

59
00:02:38,137 --> 00:02:39,817
Oh, shit, they're fighting!
They're hurting him!

60
00:02:39,841 --> 00:02:41,323
- Who do you serve?
- Fuck!

61
00:02:41,348 --> 00:02:43,516
No, don't shoot. Don't shoot, Lucy!

62
00:02:43,885 --> 00:02:44,958
Shit!

63
00:02:45,317 --> 00:02:46,317
God damn!

64
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:47,759
They're getting away.

65
00:02:49,051 --> 00:02:51,191
Shit, fuck, fuck, he's hurt.

66
00:03:02,842 --> 00:03:04,092
Fuck. Scotty!

67
00:03:04,117 --> 00:03:05,386
No, no, no, no. Stay in the car.

68
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:06,480
Stay in the car. Lucy!

69
00:03:06,505 --> 00:03:07,980
Lucy, stay in the...

70
00:03:17,825 --> 00:03:19,516
Oh, fuck!

71
00:03:20,731 --> 00:03:21,995
Fuck!

72
00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:32,959
Hey!

73
00:03:34,222 --> 00:03:35,456
Oh, God. Scotty?

74
00:03:35,481 --> 00:03:36,667
Scotty!

75
00:03:37,897 --> 00:03:39,217
Mask.

76
00:03:39,242 --> 00:03:40,242
Scotty.

77
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:46,620
Where's Lucy?

78
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,847
Lucy.

79
00:03:59,211 --> 00:04:01,336
Lucy!

80
00:04:01,676 --> 00:04:04,706
Fuck, fuck! She's fucking dead.

81
00:04:04,731 --> 00:04:06,323
Scotty, don't say that. Come on.

82
00:04:06,348 --> 00:04:08,640
- Is she breathing?
- She's not breathing.

83
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:10,683
She's fucking dead, man.

84
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:11,925
Fuck.

85
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:15,333
Fuck.

86
00:04:17,325 --> 00:04:19,034
We gotta get rid of her.

87
00:04:19,288 --> 00:04:20,441
What?

88
00:04:29,184 --> 00:04:30,487
Ready?

89
00:04:31,622 --> 00:04:35,878
One, two, three.

90
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:52,128
- Should we say something?
- Shh.

91
00:04:59,765 --> 00:05:01,139
Help.

92
00:05:02,819 --> 00:05:04,597
Oh, shit.

93

94
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:18,559
What are we supposed to be thinking?

95
00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:21,402
They just disappeared,
just got up, and waltzed away?

96
00:05:21,427 --> 00:05:22,737
I think maybe what we've witnessed here

97
00:05:22,761 --> 00:05:24,121
is nothing short of a miracle.

98
00:05:24,146 --> 00:05:26,272
We need to go home and love one another,
be good to each other.

99
00:05:26,296 --> 00:05:27,709
That's the lesson to take from this.

100
00:05:27,733 --> 00:05:29,850
Maybe it was never even
real to begin with.

101
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:32,625
Maybe it was all just, like,
a figment of imagination,

102
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:35,286
a spiritual test that we overcame.

103
00:05:35,311 --> 00:05:37,169
Okay, well, they certainly felt real

104
00:05:37,194 --> 00:05:39,278
when we drove over what
felt like their skulls.

105
00:05:39,303 --> 00:05:40,513
Don't say that, Kelvin.

106
00:05:40,538 --> 00:05:42,246
Don't be like that,
projecting negativity.

107
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:43,623
Yeah, seriously, trying to act like

108
00:05:43,647 --> 00:05:45,247
we're gonna get in trouble or some shit.

109
00:05:46,667 --> 00:05:49,391
There is one matter I'd like
a little clarity on, though.

110
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:51,114
- 'Sup?
- The money.

111
00:05:51,411 --> 00:05:52,841
Where'd it come from, Judy?

112
00:05:53,546 --> 00:05:55,333
Cutting grass, cutting hairdos.

113
00:05:55,358 --> 00:05:58,106
Bullshit. You stole it from the church.

114
00:05:58,131 --> 00:05:59,131
Yeah, duh.

115
00:05:59,156 --> 00:06:00,572
So technically, it's not yours.

116
00:06:00,597 --> 00:06:02,466
Uh, 'cept it is mine,

117
00:06:02,491 --> 00:06:04,224
'cause I'm the one who
found a hiding place.

118
00:06:04,249 --> 00:06:05,941
I had to sneak. I had to climb stuff.

119
00:06:05,966 --> 00:06:07,019
I had to think it through.

120
00:06:07,044 --> 00:06:09,464
I stole that money fair and square.
You did not.

121
00:06:09,489 --> 00:06:11,667
That money would be gone if
it was not for my bravery

122
00:06:11,692 --> 00:06:13,261
and... and knowledge and courage

123
00:06:13,286 --> 00:06:16,391
to go back into the whole melee
and grab those fucking bags.

124
00:06:16,416 --> 00:06:17,708
That's true facts.

125
00:06:17,733 --> 00:06:20,099
So now we need to figure
out a meaningful way

126
00:06:20,124 --> 00:06:21,262
in which we can divvy it up.

127
00:06:21,287 --> 00:06:23,622
No, no, no, no,
how 'bout nobody gets a cut, okay?

128
00:06:23,647 --> 00:06:24,875
- Yeah.
- How 'bout it all goes back

129
00:06:24,899 --> 00:06:26,499
- to the church?
- I like that plan.

130
00:06:26,524 --> 00:06:28,224
That's a good plan.
Yes, now we're talking.

131
00:06:28,249 --> 00:06:30,266
No, I don't like that plan.
How 'bout this?

132
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:31,643
How 'bout we give half
of it back to the church

133
00:06:31,667 --> 00:06:33,375
and the other half we split 50/50?

134
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,256
How 'bout give a third
of it to the church,

135
00:06:35,281 --> 00:06:37,116
the other half 70/30?

136
00:06:37,141 --> 00:06:38,577
70 to me, 30 to you.

137
00:06:38,602 --> 00:06:40,892
How about a quarter back
to the church, 60/40 split?

138
00:06:40,917 --> 00:06:43,288
How about 1/8 back
to the church, 60/40 split?

139
00:06:43,313 --> 00:06:45,224
Church gets nothing, 60/40?

140
00:06:45,249 --> 00:06:46,717
- Deal.
- Deal.

141
00:06:46,742 --> 00:06:48,272
Hold on. Wait a second.

142
00:06:48,297 --> 00:06:50,819
See some new shoes?
Got some 22s you want?

143
00:06:51,155 --> 00:06:53,155
Security camera right there.

144
00:06:53,453 --> 00:06:54,869
Oh, my God.

145
00:06:58,813 --> 00:07:00,481
Oh, we're gonna need that.

146
00:07:04,296 --> 00:07:07,303
This hit-and-run story is
only gonna hold for so long.

147
00:07:07,912 --> 00:07:10,168
We gotta get out of here
before anybody else comes

148
00:07:10,193 --> 00:07:11,733
and asks more questions.

149
00:07:15,637 --> 00:07:16,975
How's Lucy?

150
00:07:17,445 --> 00:07:19,764
Yeah, uh, she's still...

151
00:07:23,418 --> 00:07:24,928
Pretty fucked up?

152
00:07:25,911 --> 00:07:27,453
Yeah.

153
00:07:27,478 --> 00:07:30,208
She can never know
what happened to her back at that hill,

154
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:32,418
how she got down there.

155
00:07:32,973 --> 00:07:35,583
- What are we supposed to say?
- I don't know.

156
00:07:35,726 --> 00:07:37,286
You know, that they did it.

157
00:07:37,714 --> 00:07:39,547
And they fucking ran us over,

158
00:07:39,572 --> 00:07:41,947
then they picked us up and
tossed us down the hill.

159
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:44,512
And then you showed up
when the coast was clear.

160
00:07:44,537 --> 00:07:47,037
Man, this whole thing has
just gotten so messed up.

161
00:07:52,249 --> 00:07:53,645
I need to see her.

162
00:07:55,064 --> 00:07:56,314
Scotty, seeing her like this

163
00:07:56,339 --> 00:07:58,088
is not gonna make you feel any better.

164
00:07:58,113 --> 00:08:00,629
Eh, if I can get her
to make me cum, it will.

165
00:08:00,913 --> 00:08:02,286
Hold my sauce.

166
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:12,708
Hey, you hang out here,
and you keep a lookout.

167
00:08:12,733 --> 00:08:14,350
Scotty, she's in no shape

168
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:16,351
to do the things that you are
thinking about doing in there.

169
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:18,124
She's fighting for her life.

170
00:08:18,149 --> 00:08:21,886
She is my girl, and I will
decide what she's in shape for.

171
00:08:21,911 --> 00:08:23,433
Now don't come in.

172
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:25,098
No. Scotty, Scotty.

173
00:08:25,123 --> 00:08:26,831
Don't do that. Scotty, Scotty.

174
00:08:26,856 --> 00:08:28,254
Shit.

175
00:08:48,841 --> 00:08:49,933
Shit.

176
00:08:51,137 --> 00:08:52,489
What are you doing?

177
00:08:52,514 --> 00:08:54,166
Getting her the hell out of here.

178
00:08:54,191 --> 00:08:56,731
You didn't really think I'd
try and get a blowjob, did you?

179
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,700
That's disgusting.

180
00:09:02,818 --> 00:09:04,458
Hello?

181
00:09:21,779 --> 00:09:23,239
There he is.

182
00:09:25,249 --> 00:09:26,577
But I do a little bit.

183
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,886
- He was a baby.
- He was a little baby bird.

184
00:09:29,911 --> 00:09:31,286
What the heck are y'all doing?

185
00:09:31,562 --> 00:09:33,387
Baby, you're home early.

186
00:09:33,412 --> 00:09:34,808
Nobody's supposed to be in here.

187
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:36,886
We were just looking at pictures.

188
00:09:36,911 --> 00:09:38,541
Guess what? Y'all hear about this?

189
00:09:38,566 --> 00:09:40,640
Gideon got cast in a Netflix movie.

190
00:09:40,665 --> 00:09:41,790
Say what now?

191
00:09:42,051 --> 00:09:44,541
I think y'all should just
go brush your teeth, okay?

192
00:09:44,566 --> 00:09:47,683
He seems to be doing well in LA,
following his dreams.

193
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:49,458
What, to be a bum in California?

194
00:09:49,483 --> 00:09:50,784
Congratulations.

195
00:09:50,809 --> 00:09:52,124
He's not a bum. He's a stuntman.

196
00:09:52,149 --> 00:09:53,387
Same damn thing.

197
00:09:53,412 --> 00:09:54,872
Hollywood.

198
00:09:57,016 --> 00:09:58,637
Did you just blow a kiss at me?

199
00:10:01,103 --> 00:10:03,042
Abraham, stop blowing on them coins.

200
00:10:03,067 --> 00:10:04,090
Go brush your teeth.

201
00:10:07,471 --> 00:10:09,221
What the hell, Amber? He called?

202
00:10:09,246 --> 00:10:10,850
- He did.
- And you spoke with him?

203
00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:12,625
I can't just cut off our son.

204
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:14,974
Well, I don't know why not.
He did that to us,

205
00:10:14,999 --> 00:10:17,300
snipped our nuts like
we're damn street dogs.

206
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:20,575
Well, he's a child,
and he's reaching out.

207
00:10:20,928 --> 00:10:23,143
To you, he is.
He ain't reaching out to me.

208
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,347
I didn't hear my damn phone ringing.

209
00:10:25,372 --> 00:10:27,351
You know what, as far as
I'm concerned, he's cancelled.

210
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:29,184
If he don't give a flip about
this family and don't want

211
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:31,249
to be a part of it, that's fine with me.

212
00:10:31,274 --> 00:10:32,899
But what I do give a flip about

213
00:10:32,924 --> 00:10:35,114
is you not being honest with me.

214
00:10:35,667 --> 00:10:37,500
Baby, I'm being honest with you.

215
00:10:37,525 --> 00:10:40,516
I'm telling you right now that
he called and that we spoke.

216
00:10:40,541 --> 00:10:42,917
I know, and we said that we
weren't gonna speak to him.

217
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:44,786
- Okay.
- Now he got you and the boys

218
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:47,081
aligning behind my back
with our apostate son.

219
00:10:47,106 --> 00:10:48,308
I look like the bad guy.

220
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:51,500
Oh, baby, you're not the bad guy.

221
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:53,892
- You're not.
- I know I'm not the bad guy.

222
00:10:53,917 --> 00:10:55,667
Now, you know, I-I'm working big time,

223
00:10:55,692 --> 00:10:58,636
overtime to keep the unity
and sanctity of this family.

224
00:10:58,661 --> 00:11:00,668
- I hear you.
- I don't need people undercutting me.

225
00:11:00,692 --> 00:11:01,825
You don't.

226
00:11:03,309 --> 00:11:06,073
I don't know why you wanna
hang out in this dumbass room anyway,

227
00:11:06,098 --> 00:11:08,066
all this stupid, childish shit.

228
00:11:08,348 --> 00:11:09,644
Boring.

229
00:11:16,124 --> 00:11:17,500
How you feeling?

230
00:11:17,525 --> 00:11:18,996
Shitty.

231
00:11:23,174 --> 00:11:25,301
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

232
00:11:25,326 --> 00:11:27,229
Don't treat her like she's handicapped.

233
00:11:27,254 --> 00:11:29,875
She shall not recover
lest she be challenged.

234
00:11:32,899 --> 00:11:34,059
Come on.

235
00:11:35,085 --> 00:11:36,621
There you go, sunshine.

236
00:11:36,939 --> 00:11:39,565
Ah, there you go, coming back already.

237
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:42,058
Squeeze it. Squeeze it.

238
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:44,144
Mm-hmm. You got it.

239
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:47,980
Love that. Love that.

240
00:11:48,228 --> 00:11:50,811
I've been thinking about
what we should do next.

241
00:11:50,836 --> 00:11:52,433
I think we should murder them.

242
00:11:53,733 --> 00:11:54,941
Murder?

243
00:11:55,169 --> 00:11:57,879
Vengeance. Yes, please.

244
00:11:57,904 --> 00:11:59,824
If they're dead, we get nothing.

245
00:12:01,058 --> 00:12:02,723
I fucking love you.

246
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:05,793
Of course we should stick 'em
for more money. That's smart.

247
00:12:05,818 --> 00:12:08,246
How are we gonna do that?
We have no leverage.

248
00:12:08,271 --> 00:12:10,004
With the backup copy of the tape.

249
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:12,277
- Backup copy?
- Yeah.

250
00:12:12,528 --> 00:12:14,707
I got a backup on my jack off drive,

251
00:12:14,732 --> 00:12:18,948
my LaCie Rugged,
indestructible weatherproof.

252
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:23,863
- I have a question.
- Mm-hmm.

253
00:12:24,445 --> 00:12:27,230
How did I end up down
that hill after the drop?

254
00:12:29,904 --> 00:12:31,480
You don't wanna know.

255
00:12:32,043 --> 00:12:33,402
Yeah, I do.

256
00:12:34,614 --> 00:12:36,340
They're ruthless, baby.

257
00:12:37,429 --> 00:12:39,512
They threw both of us down there

258
00:12:40,192 --> 00:12:41,746
like a sack of cats.

259
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:50,677
The security footage from
that camera is stored

260
00:12:50,701 --> 00:12:53,141
on a local server in the
back office of RimTyme.

261
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:55,450
I spoke with an employee
on his smoke break.

262
00:12:55,475 --> 00:12:56,475
Don't worry.

263
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,582
I disguised myself as a regular man.

264
00:12:59,041 --> 00:13:01,338
I want you guys to go in there
and get me that footage, all right?

265
00:13:01,362 --> 00:13:02,914
- Let's wrap this up.
- Okay.

266
00:13:02,939 --> 00:13:04,251
Why can't you do it?

267
00:13:04,731 --> 00:13:06,017
What'd you say?

268
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:08,364
- I said...
- What's that?

269
00:13:08,389 --> 00:13:09,513
Why can't you...

270
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:11,744
Don't challenge me, Levi.

271
00:13:11,769 --> 00:13:14,994
"Why can't you do it?
Why can't you do it?"

272
00:13:15,474 --> 00:13:16,724
Do it.

273
00:13:16,892 --> 00:13:18,643
Get in there. Get that fucking footage.

274
00:13:20,708 --> 00:13:22,500
I wish Chad wasn't in a coma!

275
00:13:22,525 --> 00:13:24,500
He sure as hell would
do what I asked of him

276
00:13:24,525 --> 00:13:26,725
without asking a bunch
of fucking questions!

277
00:13:28,149 --> 00:13:30,376
Sir, I spoke with a manager about

278
00:13:30,401 --> 00:13:32,344
a break-in I had in my
car in this parking lot.

279
00:13:32,369 --> 00:13:33,516
He said I can come by,

280
00:13:33,541 --> 00:13:35,851
sort through the security
cam footage in the back.

281
00:13:35,876 --> 00:13:37,917
- You spoke to who?
- The manager.

282
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:39,470
I'm the manager.

283
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:40,978
Oh.

284
00:13:41,962 --> 00:13:44,064
Okay. Uh...

285
00:13:45,336 --> 00:13:47,400
It wa... it was somebody else,

286
00:13:47,934 --> 00:13:49,220
a man.

287
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:51,683
- I'm a man.
- Yeah.

288
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:53,658
He looked like you.

289
00:13:54,734 --> 00:13:55,955
But...

290
00:13:58,591 --> 00:13:59,591
Did you get it?

291
00:13:59,616 --> 00:14:02,611
No, he didn't know nothing.
He was acting like a bitch.

292
00:14:03,061 --> 00:14:05,767
- Y'all didn't get the tape?
- He... he wasn't very helpful.

293
00:14:05,792 --> 00:14:07,353
Get the fuck back in there!

294
00:14:07,378 --> 00:14:09,648
Get the fucking tape.
Get the fuck back in there.

295
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:17,244
Y'all forget something?

296
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:46,587
Uh, okay, rolling.

297
00:14:50,343 --> 00:14:52,580
You can't kill the devil, son.

298
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:55,228
I'm coming after you.

299
00:14:55,801 --> 00:14:58,009
I still got footage of you.

300
00:14:58,999 --> 00:15:00,416
I made a copy.

301
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:02,058
So fuck you.

302
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:04,875
Now you're gonna pay me $2 million

303
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:08,058
or else this will get
released nationwide,

304
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:11,376
and once your reputation is smeared...

305
00:15:12,999 --> 00:15:15,436
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

306
00:15:16,278 --> 00:15:18,626
It doesn't really seem
like you're gonna kill him. It...

307
00:15:18,854 --> 00:15:20,525
- No.
- It kinda rang false.

308
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:22,010
What are you talking about, rang false?

309
00:15:22,034 --> 00:15:23,205
The voice is fucked up.

310
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:25,181
It's almost becoming,
like, a parody of itself.

311
00:15:25,206 --> 00:15:26,362
It feels like an empty threat,

312
00:15:26,386 --> 00:15:27,530
like you're trying to be a movie.

313
00:15:27,554 --> 00:15:29,808
Trying to be a movie? Fuck you.

314
00:15:29,833 --> 00:15:31,083
You wanna do it? No, you don't.

315
00:15:31,108 --> 00:15:32,460
So shut the fuck up. Look, I got this.

316
00:15:32,484 --> 00:15:34,681
I got this. Fuck you.
Go. Record this one.

317
00:15:34,706 --> 00:15:35,975
It's been recording
the whole time, Scott.

318
00:15:35,999 --> 00:15:37,142
All right, shut the fuck up, dude.

319
00:15:37,166 --> 00:15:39,767
Fucking piece of shit.
This mask smells like shit.

320
00:15:39,792 --> 00:15:41,096
All right, go again.

321
00:15:42,629 --> 00:15:45,713
Hey, motherfuckers.

322
00:15:46,809 --> 00:15:48,001
You scared?

323
00:15:48,802 --> 00:15:50,125
No, not really.

324
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:52,134
You know, this whole thing was my idea.

325
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:54,446
Scotty can act like he's
the leader of it and all,

326
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:56,783
but, I mean,

327
00:15:56,808 --> 00:15:58,808
he wouldn't have anything
if it weren't for me.

328
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:03,141
You two threw me
down the hill, didn't you?

329
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,611
No.

330
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:07,275
No way. No, of course not.

331
00:16:07,885 --> 00:16:09,302
You're a terrible liar.

332
00:16:09,783 --> 00:16:14,181
I weirdly expected this from him
but not from you,

333
00:16:15,051 --> 00:16:16,425
you pussy bitch.

334
00:16:19,179 --> 00:16:20,892
No, seriously, Lucy.

335
00:16:21,384 --> 00:16:22,462
Lucy.

336
00:16:24,606 --> 00:16:26,725
It's when we start believing

337
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:29,625
we can take life into our own hands,

338
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:31,609
resolve matters ourselves

339
00:16:31,634 --> 00:16:34,423
without the guiding hand of the Lord

340
00:16:34,567 --> 00:16:36,423
that we fall victim

341
00:16:36,768 --> 00:16:38,850
to the snakes of the world.

342
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:40,486
- Mm.
- Amen.

343
00:16:43,987 --> 00:16:46,138
Though cleverly disguised

344
00:16:46,163 --> 00:16:47,915
as a loving neighbor,

345
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:49,993
a trusted friend,

346
00:16:50,632 --> 00:16:53,642
- they will find their way in, folks.
- They will.

347
00:16:53,667 --> 00:16:57,398
Sometimes a snake will
come into the garden,

348
00:16:57,423 --> 00:16:59,243
and when one does,

349
00:16:59,871 --> 00:17:01,933
you need to close them eyes,

350
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:04,454
tilt that head up and say,

351
00:17:04,479 --> 00:17:06,759
"Good afternoon, Jesus."

352
00:17:06,784 --> 00:17:09,040
- Yeah.
- "Good afternoon, Lord."

353
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:11,600
That's not gonna bother Him a bit.

354
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:13,617
- I promise.
- I'll be right back.

355
00:17:15,362 --> 00:17:17,569
He's ready to hear your call,

356
00:17:17,594 --> 00:17:20,228
always there to help you

357
00:17:20,253 --> 00:17:23,099
deal with the snakes.

358
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:30,525
Let's turn to 1 Corinthians 10:13.

359
00:17:31,095 --> 00:17:32,962
Y'all wonder where those devils went,

360
00:17:33,372 --> 00:17:36,515
why there was no crime scene,
no police tape stuff,

361
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:37,540
no sign of nothing?

362
00:17:37,565 --> 00:17:40,423
Stop doing theatrics, Jesse.
Just show us your TV show.

363
00:17:40,448 --> 00:17:42,736
Security camera footage.
It's not a TV show.

364
00:17:42,761 --> 00:17:44,665
Shh, shh. Just be quiet. How 'bout that?

365
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:46,099
- I'm not gonna shush.
- Shut up.

366
00:17:46,124 --> 00:17:47,329
I'm watching TV.

367
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:15,448
Oh, shit. There's three of 'em?

368
00:18:15,473 --> 00:18:16,822
Ding, ding.

369
00:18:21,618 --> 00:18:22,798
They're not dead?

370
00:18:22,823 --> 00:18:24,853
Least the one I runned over's not.

371
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,908
The one you got has passed.

372
00:18:26,933 --> 00:18:29,000
Nuh-uh, mine looked like
he was gonna be fine.

373
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:31,705
The back fender probably just gave
him a charley horse or something.

374
00:18:31,734 --> 00:18:33,541
- Looks worse than that.
- Kelvin, shut up.

375
00:18:33,566 --> 00:18:34,808
Who cares, all right?

376
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:35,993
What we need to do here is figure out

377
00:18:36,017 --> 00:18:37,516
who these idiots are, and apparently,

378
00:18:37,541 --> 00:18:38,695
there's three of 'em.

379
00:18:39,374 --> 00:18:40,666
Let's brainstorm, okay?

380
00:18:40,691 --> 00:18:43,017
Let's have a spitball sesh right now,
come up with some ideas.

381
00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:44,352
How are we gonna find these guys?

382
00:18:44,376 --> 00:18:45,376
Levi.

383
00:18:45,401 --> 00:18:47,164
We can make a flyer
with a pic of the van,

384
00:18:47,189 --> 00:18:48,431
see if anybody's seen it.

385
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:50,709
They ain't a lost cat, Levi.

386
00:18:50,733 --> 00:18:52,224
Jeez, man.

387
00:18:52,249 --> 00:18:53,958
They ain't running for school president.

388
00:18:53,983 --> 00:18:55,661
- Yeah, dumb.
- Fuck off outta here

389
00:18:55,686 --> 00:18:56,995
with that idea, Levi.

390
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:59,073
Okay, this is a safe space.
We can pitch freely.

391
00:18:59,098 --> 00:19:01,231
Anybody else got anything?
Gregory, you got something?

392
00:19:01,575 --> 00:19:03,058
- Not yet.
- Yeah, not yet.

393
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:04,248
Of course. I'm not gonna hold my breath.

394
00:19:04,272 --> 00:19:07,266
- Uh, I have a real idea.
- Oh, well, let me guess.

395
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:09,141
"We should tell Daddy
and turn ourselves in."

396
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:10,693
All right, do you...
Do you want my idea?

397
00:19:10,717 --> 00:19:12,958
- Well, let's hear it.
- Okay, then shut up real quick.

398
00:19:13,145 --> 00:19:16,224
Thank you. Traffic cams, right?

399
00:19:16,249 --> 00:19:19,850
They got videotapes on them,
and when cars drive through 'em,

400
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:22,058
it will videotape that footage.

401
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:25,500
So I say we go and get
traffic cam footage from,

402
00:19:25,525 --> 00:19:27,108
like, the area that night,

403
00:19:27,239 --> 00:19:28,724
and then we can track where they went.

404
00:19:28,748 --> 00:19:30,057
Well, is that, like, a real thing?

405
00:19:30,081 --> 00:19:31,124
Yeah, it is.

406
00:19:31,149 --> 00:19:33,708
Every red light has a camera and, like,

407
00:19:33,864 --> 00:19:35,391
tons of technologies on it.

408
00:19:35,629 --> 00:19:36,708
Look at him.

409
00:19:36,733 --> 00:19:38,850
That's my baby bro-bro right there.

410
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:40,351
- Don't touch me.
- Thank you for participating

411
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:42,214
instead of being mopey
for once in your life.

412
00:19:42,239 --> 00:19:44,266
This is good.
This is exactly what we need.

413
00:19:44,291 --> 00:19:45,387
Thank you, buddy.

414
00:19:45,412 --> 00:19:47,128
So Kelvin's figured out that much.

415
00:19:47,153 --> 00:19:49,268
I need that traffic cam footage.

416
00:19:49,293 --> 00:19:50,714
Who in here's gonna get it for me?

417
00:19:50,739 --> 00:19:53,497
Not me. I've done enough already.

418
00:19:53,522 --> 00:19:56,516
Gregory, what if Jesus Christ
just did one or two things

419
00:19:56,541 --> 00:19:58,769
and was like, "I'm good.
I don't need to die on the cross."

420
00:19:58,793 --> 00:20:01,683
- Where would we be then?
- I don't know, Jess.

421
00:20:01,708 --> 00:20:03,708
Get your head out of your asshole, okay?

422
00:20:04,705 --> 00:20:06,879
I think I know someone who could help.

423
00:20:07,879 --> 00:20:12,059
See, you have form RG004A.

424
00:20:12,348 --> 00:20:16,808
You need form FR309 for a fleet
policy of 25 or more vehicles,

425
00:20:16,833 --> 00:20:18,391
which is the situation you're in.

426
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:20,043
So once you fill that form out,

427
00:20:20,068 --> 00:20:21,933
you can come back up
here and we'll get...

428
00:20:21,958 --> 00:20:24,375
I'll... I'll help you
with further assistance.

429
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,629
God bless you.

430
00:20:26,768 --> 00:20:28,036
Yo, what's up?

431
00:20:28,541 --> 00:20:30,973
Okay, yeah. Over... over back?

432
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:38,808
I could lose my job for this,
but I'd do anything for you.

433
00:20:38,833 --> 00:20:40,903
- You know that, Kelvin.
- I know.

434
00:20:42,186 --> 00:20:43,892
You saved me from the darkness,

435
00:20:43,917 --> 00:20:45,395
brought me to the light.

436
00:20:46,095 --> 00:20:47,567
I owe you everything.

437
00:20:48,523 --> 00:20:50,558
You know, I'd even
kill myself if you asked me to.

438
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:52,249
- What the hell?
- I know, buddy.

439
00:20:52,274 --> 00:20:53,669
You tell me that a lot.

440
00:20:53,693 --> 00:20:54,708
Okay, I would, though.

441
00:20:54,733 --> 00:20:56,255
I'm not gonna tell you to kill yourself.

442
00:20:56,279 --> 00:20:57,333
Okay.

443
00:20:57,875 --> 00:20:59,583
So these guys in the red van here,

444
00:20:59,608 --> 00:21:02,099
they're... uh, they're our
buds and our friends, you know?

445
00:21:02,124 --> 00:21:04,224
And we're just playing
some pranks with them.

446
00:21:04,249 --> 00:21:06,676
Yeah, just car pranks,
your average car prank.

447
00:21:06,701 --> 00:21:08,940
- Well, I trust you, friend.
- I know.

448
00:21:08,965 --> 00:21:11,999
Here's that van crossing the
intersection that you gave me.

449
00:21:12,024 --> 00:21:14,357
And then cameras catch the van

450
00:21:14,382 --> 00:21:16,141
for about a mile, and then we lose 'em.

451
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:17,823
- Huh.
- But then we pick them up again

452
00:21:17,848 --> 00:21:19,739
on a cam near the hospital.

453
00:21:20,153 --> 00:21:22,016
And, uh, a few hours later,

454
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:24,723
a camera picks the van up as
it's leaving the hospital.

455
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:27,583
And then, um, we end up

456
00:21:27,608 --> 00:21:30,482
following them all the way
on cams to right there.

457
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:34,458
And how long ago was that?

458
00:21:34,483 --> 00:21:37,301
- A week ago.
- And where are they now?

459
00:21:37,473 --> 00:21:38,864
They're still there,

460
00:21:39,181 --> 00:21:40,621
the same place they were a...

461
00:21:40,646 --> 00:21:42,129
A week ago.

462
00:21:47,458 --> 00:21:49,355
<i>You can't kill the devil, son.</i>

463
00:21:50,257 --> 00:21:51,605
<i>I'm coming after you.</i>

464
00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:54,004
Eat shit, Gemstones.

465
00:21:59,199 --> 00:22:00,878
What the fuck?

466
00:22:09,208 --> 00:22:11,191
Did you fuck us?

467
00:22:11,216 --> 00:22:13,350
- What are you talking about?
- Chicken shit.

468
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:15,129
- You did this.
- No.

469
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,754
It was me.

470
00:22:16,973 --> 00:22:18,418
You did this?

471
00:22:18,601 --> 00:22:21,266
I'm going home.
You left me for dead, Scotty.

472
00:22:21,291 --> 00:22:22,979
You dumped my body down a fucking ditch!

473
00:22:23,004 --> 00:22:24,151
No, I didn't.

474
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:26,262
Is that what he told you? Huh?

475
00:22:26,287 --> 00:22:28,516
This was our ticket.
This was everything.

476
00:22:28,541 --> 00:22:31,713
You and me, Thailand, piña coladas.

477
00:22:31,738 --> 00:22:32,742
Fuck you.

478
00:22:40,121 --> 00:22:41,816
Lucy!

479
00:22:46,152 --> 00:22:47,363
You told her.

480
00:22:47,388 --> 00:22:49,430
No, I didn't.

481
00:22:49,796 --> 00:22:51,370
Why'd you tell her?

482
00:22:51,838 --> 00:22:54,659
You like her? You think she likes you?

483
00:22:56,494 --> 00:22:59,475
No, no. Don't do this, okay?

484
00:22:59,507 --> 00:23:02,003
- You're hurt.
- Yeah, you're about to be hurt.

485
00:23:06,434 --> 00:23:07,675
Enough, okay?

486
00:23:10,972 --> 00:23:12,136
Ow!

487
00:23:12,434 --> 00:23:14,726
Whoa! Okay.

488
00:23:14,751 --> 00:23:15,959
I got something else.

489
00:23:17,958 --> 00:23:19,636
What the fuck was that?

490
00:23:22,715 --> 00:23:24,132
All right.

491
00:23:24,358 --> 00:23:25,725
Come on, man.

492
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:27,124
Oh, oh.

493
00:23:32,124 --> 00:23:33,433
Oh, my God, you broke my back.

494
00:23:33,458 --> 00:23:34,628
Okay, enough, all right?

495
00:23:34,653 --> 00:23:35,809
I'm gonna get you up and no more.

496
00:23:35,833 --> 00:23:37,166
You broke my fucking back.

497
00:23:37,191 --> 00:23:39,097
Come on, Scotty, you gotta work with me.

498
00:23:39,122 --> 00:23:40,175
Come on.

499
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:46,774
Oh, what's up now, bitch?

500
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:47,815
Fuck you.

501
00:23:49,493 --> 00:23:50,602
What are you gonna do?

502
00:23:57,359 --> 00:23:59,725
Quit fucking doing that shit.

503
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:01,667
Enough, all right?

504
00:24:01,692 --> 00:24:03,104
You fucked up, man!

505
00:24:03,129 --> 00:24:05,433
I'm tapping out. I submit.

506
00:24:05,458 --> 00:24:06,948
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you!

507
00:24:06,973 --> 00:24:08,116
You lost the fucking money,

508
00:24:08,141 --> 00:24:09,848
and you're gonna get it
back one way or the other.

509
00:24:09,872 --> 00:24:11,350
- I'll get the money.
- Okay?

510
00:24:11,375 --> 00:24:12,933
I'll get the fucking money, okay?

511
00:24:13,781 --> 00:24:16,489
All right. Truce.

512
00:24:16,514 --> 00:24:19,222
- Truce?
- Yeah, come on. Fuck you.

513
00:24:19,247 --> 00:24:20,957
Jesus Christ, Scott.

514
00:24:24,642 --> 00:24:28,159
If you don't, I will kill you.

515
00:24:29,541 --> 00:24:31,034
Does that sound believable?

516
00:24:31,559 --> 00:24:34,909
Do I sound like I'm trying
to be a fucking movie?

517
00:24:35,527 --> 00:24:37,190
You're fucking crazy.

518
00:24:38,582 --> 00:24:40,667
Get me the money.

519
00:24:49,628 --> 00:24:50,706
Ugh.

520
00:24:51,431 --> 00:24:52,775
Oh, fuck.

521
00:25:36,401 --> 00:25:37,808
Quick question, friend.

522
00:25:38,346 --> 00:25:39,850
You seen this van around?

523
00:25:41,233 --> 00:25:43,167
Seen a lot of vans around, man.

524
00:25:44,076 --> 00:25:45,577
Kelvin, plan B.

525
00:25:45,602 --> 00:25:48,878
Maybe this will refresh
your memory, hmm?

526
00:25:48,903 --> 00:25:49,903
- How you like that, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

527
00:25:49,917 --> 00:25:51,100
- Does that help a little bit?
- Got some answers now?

528
00:25:51,124 --> 00:25:52,471
- He loves it.
- Okay, yeah.

529
00:25:52,496 --> 00:25:53,957
They've been staying here
for, like, a week.

530
00:25:53,981 --> 00:25:55,767
- Yeah!
- Okay, all right.

531
00:25:55,792 --> 00:25:57,410
- I told you.
- There you go.

532
00:25:57,435 --> 00:25:58,809
Though they checked out today.

533
00:25:59,410 --> 00:26:00,987
- They checked out today?
- Ah, shoot.

534
00:26:02,435 --> 00:26:05,106
Hey, Honey Bunches of Oats.

535
00:26:05,422 --> 00:26:07,974
♪ Doo-doo-doo-doo ♪
What'd they look like?

536
00:26:07,999 --> 00:26:09,333
Huh? Details.

537
00:26:09,653 --> 00:26:10,942
Think hard.

538
00:26:11,721 --> 00:26:13,403
Just like regular white people.

539
00:26:15,497 --> 00:26:18,049
Did this whites happen to tell
you where they were heading?

540
00:26:18,074 --> 00:26:20,715
No, man, fuck you think?
People don't say shit to me.

541
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:23,081
Perhaps that's because
of the customer service.

542
00:26:23,106 --> 00:26:25,041
- Is this little boy your son?
- I'm fully grown.

543
00:26:25,066 --> 00:26:26,668
Thank you. I'm an adult man.

544
00:26:27,038 --> 00:26:29,016
Okay, well, uh,
y'all want a room or what?

545
00:26:29,041 --> 00:26:31,434
No, we don't want a room!
We want answers!

546
00:26:32,129 --> 00:26:35,141
Fucking guy thinks I'm old enough
to be your daddy. Jesus H.

547
00:26:35,166 --> 00:26:37,199
Well, you are aging horrifically.

548
00:26:37,715 --> 00:26:39,308
Look, Jesse, I know you're disappointed,

549
00:26:39,332 --> 00:26:41,291
but I think it's for the best.

550
00:26:41,316 --> 00:26:42,974
I don't know what you're capable of.

551
00:26:42,999 --> 00:26:45,541
I don't want our paths to cross
with those guys ever again.

552
00:26:45,566 --> 00:26:47,903
Shit, maybe that's that.

553
00:26:50,255 --> 00:26:51,965
No, I don't think so.

554
00:27:05,384 --> 00:27:06,926
Damn it.

555
00:27:06,951 --> 00:27:08,684
You're leading too much.

556
00:27:10,052 --> 00:27:11,093
Funny.

557
00:27:11,118 --> 00:27:13,326
I wasn't having any trouble
'fore you got here.

558
00:27:13,351 --> 00:27:14,809
You know, I would have come with you

559
00:27:14,834 --> 00:27:17,317
if you wanted to shoot
'em like we used to together.

560
00:27:17,528 --> 00:27:19,543
You're the one who stopped, not me.

561
00:27:21,575 --> 00:27:22,848
I'm sorry, baby.

562
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:26,871
I'm so sorry that I didn't
tell you I was talking to him.

563
00:27:27,542 --> 00:27:29,621
I never should have kept that from you.

564
00:27:30,273 --> 00:27:31,473
I agree.

565
00:27:32,153 --> 00:27:34,183
Can't keep secrets from family.
It's not right.

566
00:27:34,208 --> 00:27:37,066
No. No more.

567
00:27:37,091 --> 00:27:38,091
Deal.

568
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:40,824
Deal. Come here.

569
00:27:46,993 --> 00:27:47,993
Ooh.

570
00:28:23,551 --> 00:28:25,842
Good afternoon, Jesus.

571
00:28:25,988 --> 00:28:29,319
Thank you for watching
after my family and myself.

572
00:28:30,341 --> 00:28:34,058
And thank you for letting me be born
into this world as a Gemstone.

573
00:28:39,221 --> 00:28:41,825
The legacy of my family
carries immense weight...

574
00:28:42,875 --> 00:28:45,916
But I take it you are no
stranger to that, Dear Lord.

575
00:28:48,515 --> 00:28:51,161
We gotta get off the compound, baby.

576
00:28:52,625 --> 00:28:54,541
Oh, take me right here.

577
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:56,316
My duties are great,

578
00:28:56,341 --> 00:28:59,642
but many are the pleasures
you have bestowed upon me.

579
00:28:59,667 --> 00:29:01,500
Oh, no.

580
00:29:01,525 --> 00:29:03,058
I came.

581
00:29:03,763 --> 00:29:05,520
I'm so sorry.

582
00:29:13,875 --> 00:29:17,382
Grant me strength, Dear Lord,
to lead the people...

583
00:29:20,226 --> 00:29:22,703
To bring them to your righteous kingdom.

584
00:29:28,566 --> 00:29:29,974
And thank you, Lord,

585
00:29:30,328 --> 00:29:32,475
for forgiving me of my wrongdoings,

586
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:34,625
which you know are not who I am.

587
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:37,266
Your ability to accept
me for the sinner I am

588
00:29:37,291 --> 00:29:39,304
only speaks to your greatness...

589
00:29:41,445 --> 00:29:43,476
His righteous grace...

590
00:29:45,583 --> 00:29:49,875
Your guidance and mercy is all
that the Gemstones require.

591
00:29:50,842 --> 00:29:54,171
Please, teach me your patience.

592
00:29:55,205 --> 00:29:56,697
Teach...

593
00:29:57,958 --> 00:29:59,406
Fuckin' A.

594
00:30:00,476 --> 00:30:02,195
Somebody get the door, please.

595
00:30:05,183 --> 00:30:06,183
Get the door!

596
00:30:06,208 --> 00:30:07,531
I'm praying, God damn it!

597
00:30:11,527 --> 00:30:12,906
Hey, Mama.

598
00:30:14,367 --> 00:30:15,500
I'm home.

599
00:30:15,525 --> 00:30:18,516
Gideon. Oh, my baby.

600
00:30:21,544 --> 00:30:22,801
Oh!

601
00:30:23,981 --> 00:30:25,091
Hi.

602
00:30:25,853 --> 00:30:29,001
