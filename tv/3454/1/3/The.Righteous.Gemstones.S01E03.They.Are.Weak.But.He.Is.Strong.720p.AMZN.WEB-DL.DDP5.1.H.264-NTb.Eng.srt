1
00:00:06,267 --> 00:00:07,142
What are we supposed
to be thinking?

2
00:00:07,225 --> 00:00:08,225
They just got up
and waltzed away?

3
00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:09,225
I think maybe what we've
witnessed here

4
00:00:09,309 --> 00:00:10,267
is nothing short
of a miracle.

5
00:00:10,601 --> 00:00:12,768
Maybe it was all just like
a figment of imagination.

6
00:00:12,975 --> 00:00:14,934
They certainly felt real
when we drove over

7
00:00:15,017 --> 00:00:16,559
what felt like their skulls.

8
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:19,851
I've been thinking about
what we should do next.

9
00:00:19,934 --> 00:00:20,975
We have no leverage.

10
00:00:21,059 --> 00:00:23,100
I got a backup drive,
indestructible.

11
00:00:23,934 --> 00:00:25,309
Brother Pastors.

12
00:00:25,392 --> 00:00:27,100
We all have churches
in Locust Grove,

13
00:00:27,184 --> 00:00:29,684
and we're scared you're gonna
run us out of our own hometown.

14
00:00:29,768 --> 00:00:32,017
I finally figured out
who the blackmailer is.

15
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,017
Johnny Seasons.

16
00:00:34,934 --> 00:00:36,225
You want to mess with me?!

17
00:00:38,726 --> 00:00:39,643
You did this.

18
00:00:39,726 --> 00:00:41,559
It was me,
I'm going home.

19
00:00:41,809 --> 00:00:43,351
I'll get the money, okay?

20

00:06:51,975 --> 00:06:53,392
for all you men out there.

162
00:06:53,476 --> 00:06:55,684
But now you can buy Jesus,
amen.

163
00:06:55,768 --> 00:06:59,392
You can buy Jesus, amen.

164
00:06:59,476 --> 00:07:02,643
But you can't
put him on layaway.

165
00:07:02,726 --> 00:07:06,184
My wife, Tiffany,
she wrote that joke.

166
00:07:06,267 --> 00:07:09,893
She has a wonderful playfulness
she approaches life with.

167
00:07:09,975 --> 00:07:13,726
I'd let her speak, but she
ain't very good at it, so...

168
00:07:13,809 --> 00:07:16,434
I'll just speak
for the both of us.

169
00:07:16,517 --> 00:07:19,059
Gideon's looking tasty.

170
00:07:19,142 --> 00:07:20,601
Staying in shape.

171
00:07:20,684 --> 00:07:22,934
He is.
I mean, that's show biz, right?

172
00:07:23,017 --> 00:07:24,768
You gotta keep
a tight physique.

173
00:07:24,851 --> 00:07:26,768
It's pretty much mand.
That's mandatory.

174
00:07:26,851 --> 00:07:28,309
I mean, depending
on what you wanna do.

175
00:07:28,392 --> 00:07:29,601
If you wanna be
behind the scenes,

176
00:07:29,684 --> 00:07:30,934
you can be fat
as fuck if you want to.

177
00:07:31,017 --> 00:07:32,768
I'm talking
about stars, okay?

178
00:07:32,851 --> 00:07:34,100
You gotta be a specimen.

179
00:07:34,184 --> 00:07:36,267
You gotta be a straight unit
in order to break through.

180
00:07:36,351 --> 00:07:38,601
Mm-hmm, I think Gideon's
got potential for that.

181
00:07:38,684 --> 00:07:39,893
He's got Mama's eyes.
Mmhmm.

182
00:07:39,975 --> 00:07:41,267
All right,
first off, he don't.

183
00:07:41,351 --> 00:07:42,726
He's got Amber's eyes.

184
00:07:42,809 --> 00:07:44,601
Second off, he ain't
even trying to be a movie star.

185
00:07:44,684 --> 00:07:45,893
He wants to be
a flippin' stunt man.

186
00:07:45,975 --> 00:07:47,476
Damn crash test dummy.

187
00:07:47,559 --> 00:07:49,434
Really? You're not
at all happy he's home?

188
00:07:49,517 --> 00:07:51,059
No, I ain't happy he's home.

189
00:07:51,142 --> 00:07:52,601
Motherfucker waltzes in here

190
00:07:52,684 --> 00:07:54,893
like he's the damn prodigal
son, everybody kissing his ass.

191
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:56,643
Before we shine him up
too much,

192
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:58,517
let's not forget how
he abandoned this family.

193
00:07:58,601 --> 00:07:59,975
I mean, who does that?

194
00:08:00,059 --> 00:08:03,100
A sociopath who only cares
about himself, that's who.

195
00:08:03,184 --> 00:08:06,975
Your daddy has got a stick
up his ass something deep.

196
00:08:07,059 --> 00:08:09,684
Yeah, well, that's how
Daddy is since Mama passed.

197
00:08:09,768 --> 00:08:11,684
All he is
is just mean all the time,

198
00:08:11,768 --> 00:08:13,392
never laughing,
never having fun.

199
00:08:13,476 --> 00:08:15,809
Staring off into nothing like
a fuckin' Zoloft commercial.

200
00:08:15,893 --> 00:08:17,267
Well,
that saddens me to hear,

201
00:08:17,351 --> 00:08:19,643
but I can't say
that I didn't see it coming.

202
00:08:19,726 --> 00:08:22,351
Eli's a weaker man
than he lets on.

203
00:08:22,434 --> 00:08:24,434
Now I don't know
about weak, now.

204
00:08:24,517 --> 00:08:25,975
I don't know, Jesse.

205
00:08:26,059 --> 00:08:28,476
His slaps, they don't pack
the same wallop they used to.

206
00:08:28,559 --> 00:08:31,267
Baby Billy,
my tooth is hurting.

207
00:08:31,351 --> 00:08:33,142
Well, put some
of that cream on it.

208
00:08:33,225 --> 00:08:34,434
I told you we gonna
get you checked out

209
00:08:34,517 --> 00:08:35,476
once we get settled here.

210
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:36,893
What, you got yourself
a cavity?

211
00:08:36,975 --> 00:08:39,142
A cavity?
What you talkin' about?

212
00:08:39,225 --> 00:08:43,017
Your Aunt Tiffany is
a perfect ten, a Bo Derek ten.

213
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,768
The looks, the bod.

214
00:08:44,851 --> 00:08:47,517
She got the heart,
but them damn teeth,

215
00:08:47,601 --> 00:08:49,684
now, they something else.

216
00:08:49,768 --> 00:08:52,059
But even with them old stained,
crooked things,

217
00:08:52,142 --> 00:08:54,059
I still love you
with all my heart.

218
00:08:54,142 --> 00:08:55,809
- Come in here.
- Mm.

219
00:08:55,893 --> 00:08:58,142
Yes, yes, I am
the luckiest man alive.

220
00:08:58,225 --> 00:09:00,392
Like, I know
I'm younger than you all,

221
00:09:00,476 --> 00:09:02,726
but I'm just gonna
be a regular aunt.

222
00:09:02,809 --> 00:09:03,975
Okay?
Yeah.

223
00:09:04,059 --> 00:09:05,893
So y'all just
call me Aunt Tiffany.

224
00:09:05,975 --> 00:09:07,351
We don't need
to mess with all that.

225
00:09:07,434 --> 00:09:09,059
We'll call you Tiffany, 'cause
we don't like formal stuff.

226
00:09:09,142 --> 00:09:11,267
No, no, that's what I want
you to call me.

227
00:09:11,351 --> 00:09:13,017
- Well, come on now.
- Aunt Tiffany.

228
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:15,559
Come on. She's been real
excited about becoming an aunt.

229
00:09:15,643 --> 00:09:19,017
Now, for old Baby Billy, y'all
just call her what she wants.

230
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,225
Okay.
Well, yeah.

231
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:21,768
Whatever, no big deal.
Hey, Aunt Tiffany.

232
00:09:21,851 --> 00:09:23,893
There you go.

233
00:09:23,975 --> 00:09:27,392
How'd you like that?
All of 'em do it.

234
00:09:27,476 --> 00:09:29,434
Well?
Now, come on.

235
00:09:30,934 --> 00:09:32,434
Say it!

236
00:09:32,517 --> 00:09:35,684
- Aunt Tiffany.
- Aunt Tiffany.

237
00:09:35,768 --> 00:09:37,768
There you go.

238
00:09:37,851 --> 00:09:41,267
Yeah, looky there now.
Thank you, thank you.

239
00:09:41,351 --> 00:09:42,517
Yes.

240
00:09:42,601 --> 00:09:44,184
Thank you.

241
00:09:44,267 --> 00:09:45,934
Thank you so much.

242
00:10:03,809 --> 00:10:04,975
Eli!

243
00:10:05,059 --> 00:10:07,934
Who the hell did this?

244
00:10:08,017 --> 00:10:10,184
Seasons.

245
00:10:15,351 --> 00:10:19,434
God, everyone was so happy
to see Gideon at church.

246
00:10:19,517 --> 00:10:21,059
Probably talkin'
trash behind our backs.

247
00:10:21,142 --> 00:10:23,309
Bunch of gossips.
I wanna have a dinner.

248
00:10:23,392 --> 00:10:25,975
I wanna get together everybody
that's close to Gideon.

249
00:10:26,059 --> 00:10:28,392
I want him to know
that he's welcome here always.

250
00:10:28,476 --> 00:10:30,100
Oh, is that
what we settled on?

251
00:10:30,184 --> 00:10:31,392
I wasn't aware
that was the deal.

252
00:10:31,476 --> 00:10:34,100
Jesse Gemstone,
our son is back in our lives.

253
00:10:34,184 --> 00:10:35,726
Isn't that only
thing that matters?

254
00:10:35,809 --> 00:10:36,934
Well, he brought shame to us

255
00:10:37,017 --> 00:10:38,267
and continues
to bring shame to us.

256
00:10:38,351 --> 00:10:40,100
But, yes, sure,
let's throw him a dinner.

257
00:10:40,184 --> 00:10:42,059
I mean, maybe this
is the perfect thing.

258
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:43,975
Maybe this is what he needed.

259
00:10:44,059 --> 00:10:46,934
Maybe he'll be serious about
his faith and he'll find Jesus,

260
00:10:47,017 --> 00:10:48,684
like Paul on that road
to Damascus.

261
00:10:48,768 --> 00:10:50,517
But is he Paul, though?

262
00:10:50,601 --> 00:10:52,184
Or is he still Saul?
He's not Saul.

263
00:10:52,267 --> 00:10:55,309
Maybe he is.
Hollywood Saul?

264
00:10:55,392 --> 00:10:57,476
He's not Hollywood Saul,
okay?

265
00:10:57,559 --> 00:10:59,309
He's sorry.
He's sorry that he ran away.

266
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:01,351
He said that,
and you need to give him

267
00:11:01,434 --> 00:11:04,851
another chance because
that is our boy and I love him.

268
00:11:04,934 --> 00:11:07,768
He's such a good boy,
and I'm happy that he's home.

269
00:11:07,851 --> 00:11:09,100
You know
what'd make me happy?

270
00:11:09,184 --> 00:11:10,517
What?

271
00:11:10,601 --> 00:11:11,934
If I could chuck one
of these wieners in your mouth.

272
00:11:17,726 --> 00:11:19,517

00:12:29,975 --> 00:12:31,059
Yeah, fuck off.

290
00:12:31,142 --> 00:12:33,225
Don't nobody
wanna see that penis.

291
00:12:33,309 --> 00:12:35,267
Then quit lookin' at it.

292
00:12:37,142 --> 00:12:39,100
Well, well, well.

293
00:12:39,184 --> 00:12:41,225
If it ain't poor little
rich boy, huh?

294
00:12:41,309 --> 00:12:42,934
Sweet bike.

295
00:12:43,017 --> 00:12:44,726
I bet you missed
all your cool toys.

296
00:12:44,809 --> 00:12:46,434
Must be nice,
living in the lap

297
00:12:46,517 --> 00:12:49,517
of luxury again, spending
time with the fam, huh?

298
00:12:51,184 --> 00:12:52,768
Where's my fuckin' money?

299
00:12:52,851 --> 00:12:54,559
In there.

300
00:12:54,643 --> 00:12:55,934
It's all the valuable stuff

301
00:12:56,017 --> 00:12:57,559
I could identify
in my parents' house.

302
00:12:57,643 --> 00:12:59,309
Glass figurines?

303
00:12:59,392 --> 00:13:01,309
What are all these numbers
next to the items?

304
00:13:01,392 --> 00:13:03,851
Well that's my guess
at market value, see?

305
00:13:06,684 --> 00:13:08,726
Fuckin' Mickey Mouse shit,
man!

306
00:13:08,809 --> 00:13:10,975
Honestly!
Scottie, don't-

307
00:13:11,059 --> 00:13:12,851
There's other stuff
in there, man.

308
00:13:14,351 --> 00:13:16,100
That's stuff!

309
00:13:16,184 --> 00:13:18,309
I want money!

310
00:13:18,392 --> 00:13:20,726
Cash!

311
00:13:20,809 --> 00:13:23,768
There's a lot of it that goes
into that church, man.

312
00:13:23,851 --> 00:13:26,851
And I wanna taste some
of that fuckin' Gemstone loot.

313
00:13:26,934 --> 00:13:29,100
We can get it, okay?
We can.

314
00:13:29,184 --> 00:13:30,893
But my Dad
doesn't trust me right now.

315
00:13:30,975 --> 00:13:33,476
He's watching me,
just waiting for me to slip up.

316
00:13:33,559 --> 00:13:35,267
I need more time.

317
00:13:35,351 --> 00:13:37,975
Your family owes me.

318
00:13:38,059 --> 00:13:42,309
I might've lost my ability
to do fight sequences.

319
00:13:42,392 --> 00:13:45,309
I have to double down
on stunt driving.

320
00:13:49,726 --> 00:13:52,768
Fuckin' stunt driving!
Just be patient.

321
00:13:52,851 --> 00:13:55,851
The deeper I get,
the more I'll have access to.

322
00:14:01,267 --> 00:14:03,601
You gettin' cold feet on me?

323
00:14:15,434 --> 00:14:19,517
Okay, I can wait
for the big score.

324
00:14:30,643 --> 00:14:33,517
Music has always
soothed my vicious temper.

325
00:14:33,601 --> 00:14:34,643
Chad knows that.

326
00:14:34,726 --> 00:14:36,809
It's good to see you back,
Chad.

327
00:14:36,893 --> 00:14:38,726
Chad paid the ultimate price
with his body,

328
00:14:38,809 --> 00:14:40,351
and I paid
for his medical bills.

329
00:14:40,434 --> 00:14:41,684
Thank you.

330
00:14:41,768 --> 00:14:43,559
Thank you for keeping
your fuckin' mouth shut.

331
00:14:43,643 --> 00:14:45,351
Now, then,
I've brought you all here

332
00:14:45,434 --> 00:14:47,017
because I have made
a discovery.

333
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,684
Could I interrupt
for a moment?

334
00:14:48,768 --> 00:14:49,851
Gregory, I said
I'm talkin' here, okay?

335
00:14:49,934 --> 00:14:51,059
Just a moment.

336
00:14:51,142 --> 00:14:52,184
I have a gift for you all

337
00:14:52,267 --> 00:14:54,684
in honor of this
alliance that's grown.

338
00:14:56,975 --> 00:15:00,517
Coins that I made
to signify our bond.

339
00:15:00,601 --> 00:15:03,309
- You made coins?
- To signify the bond.

340
00:15:05,142 --> 00:15:06,726
Here you go.
Okay.

341
00:15:06,809 --> 00:15:08,559
Judy.

342
00:15:08,643 --> 00:15:10,267
Dang,
that's got some weight to it.

343
00:15:10,351 --> 00:15:13,392
- Yeah, these are nice.
- "We did it"?

344
00:15:13,476 --> 00:15:16,142
You made coins with our names
on it that says "We did it"?

345
00:15:16,225 --> 00:15:17,726
And we're trying to put
what happened behind us.

346
00:15:17,809 --> 00:15:20,225
You can't be making
fucking souvenirs about it.

347
00:15:20,309 --> 00:15:21,684
No, we're not doing coins.

348
00:15:21,768 --> 00:15:23,559
No goddamn coins.
Gimme them coins.

349
00:15:23,643 --> 00:15:25,476
Give 'em to me.
Gimme the coins, God damn it.

350
00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:27,059
Gregory, you're an idiot, okay?

351
00:15:27,142 --> 00:15:28,517
It's the thought
that counts.

352
00:15:28,601 --> 00:15:30,934
No, it's not the thought
that counts when it can get us

353
00:15:31,017 --> 00:15:33,559
in fuckin' jail
for committing crimes, Gregory.

354
00:15:33,643 --> 00:15:36,142
Now, then, through
God's infinite wisdom I have

355
00:15:36,225 --> 00:15:39,893
discovered who the perpetrator
of this most devious plot is.

356
00:15:39,975 --> 00:15:41,893
Shit was pretty well
orchestrated, if you ask me.

357
00:15:41,975 --> 00:15:43,768
Footage like that
of us at our most...

358
00:15:43,851 --> 00:15:45,309
vulnerable state?

359
00:15:45,392 --> 00:15:47,934
That can only be done
by somebody super close to me.

360
00:15:48,017 --> 00:15:49,476
I mean, real close.

361
00:15:49,559 --> 00:15:51,601
That brings me
to the third man in the van.

362
00:15:51,684 --> 00:15:53,017
His face was
too pixelated in the video,

363
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,934
so we can't obviously tell
who it is from that.

364
00:15:56,017 --> 00:15:59,059
But dude definitely
had a slender frame.

365
00:15:59,142 --> 00:16:00,975
Walked with swagger.

366
00:16:01,059 --> 00:16:03,643
Maybe he's used to being
onstage, you know?

367
00:16:03,726 --> 00:16:07,309
Confidence, razzle dazzle,
show biz.

368
00:16:07,392 --> 00:16:09,309
Levi...

369
00:16:09,392 --> 00:16:11,559
you're a rock-and-roll dude.

370
00:16:11,643 --> 00:16:14,392
I've definitely seen
you swagger around on stage.

371
00:16:14,476 --> 00:16:17,643
I bet you think
you're pretty cool, don't you?

372
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:19,142
I'm all right.

373
00:16:19,225 --> 00:16:21,643
Yeah, you're all right.
Grab his ass.

374
00:16:21,726 --> 00:16:24,100
What are you doing?

375
00:16:24,184 --> 00:16:26,851
What are you doing, man?
Shit, Jesse.

376
00:16:26,934 --> 00:16:28,809
You're the one who picked
up the whores that night.

377
00:16:28,893 --> 00:16:31,517
No, I didn't.
You did.

378
00:16:31,601 --> 00:16:33,476
All right, well,
you introduced me to 'em.

379
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:35,434
Maybe you also went
up to that hotel room,

380
00:16:35,517 --> 00:16:36,517
hid a camera in there, huh?

381
00:16:36,601 --> 00:16:37,934
Did you do that?
I didn't do that.

382
00:16:38,017 --> 00:16:39,309
You don't wanna
tell me the truth?

383
00:16:39,392 --> 00:16:41,142
How 'bout I stick this
blade in your handsome cheek?

384
00:16:41,225 --> 00:16:42,643
Get in there
and just do spinnies,

385
00:16:42,726 --> 00:16:44,017
making that
hole bigger and bigger.

386
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,309
I'll bet you'll tell me
the truth then, won't you?

387
00:16:45,392 --> 00:16:46,975
Yeah, Jesse.
Put it in his bottom.

388
00:16:47,059 --> 00:16:48,476
You want that? No, I'm not
putting nothing in his bottom.

389
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:49,643
Just put it a little bit
in his bottom.

390
00:16:49,726 --> 00:16:50,975
Tell me the truth right now,
God damn it.

391
00:16:51,059 --> 00:16:53,017
Did you betray me?
No, Jesse!

392
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,601
- Was it you?
- I didn't do it!

393
00:16:54,684 --> 00:16:56,267
- Hey, Dad?
- What's up, huh?

394
00:16:56,351 --> 00:16:57,351
- What's going on?
- Help!

395
00:16:57,434 --> 00:16:58,809
- Shh.
- What's up?

396
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:00,225
Um, well,
I just wanted to talk,

397
00:17:00,309 --> 00:17:01,851
but if I caught you
at a bad time...

398
00:17:01,934 --> 00:17:03,184
- No, no, no, no, no.
- Help. Help.

399
00:17:03,267 --> 00:17:05,017
- This ain't a bad time.
- Did he say help?

400
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,684
No, he's not.
Just go outside.

401
00:17:06,768 --> 00:17:08,017
I'll be out there in a second.

402
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:09,392
I'm just gonna finish up prayer
with these guys.

403
00:17:09,476 --> 00:17:10,726
Okay.

404
00:17:15,142 --> 00:17:17,684
Tell me the truth right now.
Did you betray me?

405
00:17:17,768 --> 00:17:21,059
Are you Judas Iscariot to me?

406
00:17:21,142 --> 00:17:23,559
I told ya, I didn't do it.

407
00:17:27,934 --> 00:17:29,684
I believe you.

408
00:17:29,768 --> 00:17:31,643
You are forgiven
from my suspicions of you.

409
00:17:31,726 --> 00:17:33,017
Let him go, guys.

410
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:35,351
Levi's cool now.

411
00:17:35,434 --> 00:17:39,851
He's been tested.

412
00:17:39,934 --> 00:17:42,726
Don't take it personal, man.
I just had to know for sure.

413
00:17:42,809 --> 00:17:44,225
That's too far.

414
00:17:44,309 --> 00:17:45,851
I had to be sure, man.

415
00:17:45,934 --> 00:17:47,893
Hey, no hard feelings.

416
00:17:47,975 --> 00:17:49,726
Everybody,
Levi's cool now, all right?

417
00:17:49,809 --> 00:17:50,893
You play too much.

418
00:17:54,768 --> 00:17:56,059
Some people pray,

419
00:17:56,142 --> 00:17:57,851
and what they're really doing

420
00:17:57,934 --> 00:17:59,434
is asking for things.

421
00:17:59,517 --> 00:18:02,726
"Make my life better,
gimme some more money.

422
00:18:02,809 --> 00:18:04,851
Let me have more stuff."

423
00:18:04,934 --> 00:18:08,851
But God only offers one thing:

424
00:18:08,934 --> 00:18:10,559
His love.

425
00:18:10,643 --> 00:18:12,434
This is
the most boring sermon

426
00:18:12,517 --> 00:18:14,768
I've ever experienced
in my entire life.

427
00:18:14,851 --> 00:18:16,225
Let me ask you something.
Hm?

428
00:18:16,309 --> 00:18:17,893
How long you been coming
to this church?

429
00:18:17,975 --> 00:18:21,225
- About two years.
- Well, today's your last day.

430
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:22,809
You see this?
Mmhmm.

431
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:24,768
It's a brand-new church.
Locust Grove.

432
00:18:24,851 --> 00:18:26,392
I'm the head pastor.

433
00:18:26,476 --> 00:18:27,809
You know where the Sears
used to be?

434
00:18:27,893 --> 00:18:29,851
- Yes, sir.
- Well, that's where this is.

435
00:18:29,934 --> 00:18:31,768
- Okay.
- I'll see you next Sunday.

436
00:18:31,851 --> 00:18:33,100
Okay.

437
00:18:36,684 --> 00:18:39,934
This damn spoon they've got
for the casserole's too small.

438
00:18:40,017 --> 00:18:41,809
Shit keeps falling off.

439
00:18:41,893 --> 00:18:44,267
I'm gonna swap it
with this pudding spoon

440
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:46,934
this idiot stuck
in the gravy.

441
00:18:47,017 --> 00:18:48,476
Gravy needs a ladle.

442
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:49,934
This ain't no ladle.
This is a pudding spoon.

443
00:18:50,017 --> 00:18:51,517
You're taking too much.
Put it back.

444
00:18:51,601 --> 00:18:54,517
People are lookin' at you.
Do you think I give a damn?

445
00:18:54,601 --> 00:18:56,643
Nobody eyeballing
my portion servings.

446
00:18:56,726 --> 00:18:58,601
Leave me alone.

447
00:18:58,684 --> 00:19:02,392
Look at 'em over there,
big-timing us.

448
00:19:02,476 --> 00:19:05,184
Mr. Small Time thinks
he's a somebody.

449
00:19:05,267 --> 00:19:06,476
Well, I'm beginning to see

450
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:07,893
why your approach
hasn't been working.

451
00:19:07,975 --> 00:19:12,184
You have elitist tendencies,
which are not pretty.

452
00:19:12,267 --> 00:19:15,643
know how to speak
to the common man.

453
00:19:15,726 --> 00:19:17,975
Don't say nothin'.
I'm gonna do the talking.

454
00:19:19,726 --> 00:19:21,184
Nice to see you here,
Reverend.

455
00:19:21,267 --> 00:19:22,643
I'm gonna
leave this here, now.

456
00:19:22,726 --> 00:19:23,768
Don't touch it.

457
00:19:23,851 --> 00:19:25,184
I might come back
and get some biscuits.

458
00:19:25,267 --> 00:19:26,643
All right, now.

459
00:19:26,726 --> 00:19:28,768
- Brother Pastor?
- Yes?

460
00:19:28,851 --> 00:19:30,643
I just wanted
to introduce myself.

461
00:19:30,726 --> 00:19:33,142
Baby Billy Freeman.
I'm your new neighbor.

462
00:19:35,601 --> 00:19:39,100
I heard that you and old hombre
Eli got off on the wrong foot.

463
00:19:39,184 --> 00:19:42,142
To be quite honest with you,
he gets on my nerves too.

464
00:19:42,225 --> 00:19:43,684
I'd appreciate
if the two of you fellas

465
00:19:43,768 --> 00:19:45,184
get the hell out of my church.

466
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:47,517
I got nothin' to say to you.

467
00:19:47,601 --> 00:19:49,684
Well, you sure had something
to say

468
00:19:49,768 --> 00:19:52,225
when you were spreading lies
about us.

469
00:19:52,309 --> 00:19:53,851
I do not lie, sir.

470
00:19:53,934 --> 00:19:56,517
You or one of your boys
or someone from your church

471
00:19:56,601 --> 00:19:59,975
came to my house
with weapons, batons.

472
00:20:00,059 --> 00:20:01,559
My wife was at home.

473
00:20:01,643 --> 00:20:03,975
You be careful of what you're
accusing us of, Johnny Seasons.

474
00:20:04,059 --> 00:20:06,017
Maybe you should be careful.

475
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:08,517
Locust Grove's gonna be nothin'
but trouble for you.

476
00:20:08,601 --> 00:20:11,476
Oh, y'all just stop.
Stop intimidatin' right now.

477
00:20:11,559 --> 00:20:13,517
Now, look, Pastor.

478
00:20:13,601 --> 00:20:16,392
Now, the fact of the matter
is we're here now.

479
00:20:16,476 --> 00:20:19,643
We in that Sears,
and we ain't going nowhere.

480
00:20:19,726 --> 00:20:21,476
Now I... I just think
that we should

481
00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:23,643
all live in harmony
as brothers in Christ.

482
00:20:23,726 --> 00:20:25,726
Now, why can't we do that?

483
00:20:28,309 --> 00:20:31,184
What is it you're lookin'
for here, Eli?

484
00:20:31,267 --> 00:20:33,893
How is it I can be content
in only God's love,

485
00:20:33,975 --> 00:20:35,392
and that's not enough for you?

486
00:20:35,476 --> 00:20:37,893
You want more, don't you?

487
00:20:37,975 --> 00:20:41,351
Why is that?
Why are you so hungry?

488
00:20:57,643 --> 00:20:59,392
Here.

489
00:20:59,476 --> 00:21:02,100
Come on.
Why you got to do that, Eli?

490
00:21:04,267 --> 00:21:06,559
Just put this... put this
in your pocket, Pastor.

491
00:21:06,643 --> 00:21:09,517
That ought to cover it, now.
Eli?

492
00:21:11,184 --> 00:21:13,184
Eli, hold up.

493
00:21:15,225 --> 00:21:18,934
Excuse me.
Gotta get my friend.

494
00:21:25,142 --> 00:21:27,768
So, um...

495
00:21:27,851 --> 00:21:30,392
Okay, uh...

496
00:21:30,476 --> 00:21:32,934
I was thinking,
while I'm home,

497
00:21:33,017 --> 00:21:35,142
I would like
to work with Martin.

498
00:21:35,225 --> 00:21:37,059
Shadow him.

499
00:21:37,142 --> 00:21:40,059
Sort of see the ins
and outs of running this place.

500
00:21:40,142 --> 00:21:41,601
Was this your idea, Martin?

501
00:21:41,684 --> 00:21:45,059
It was his idea, but I have
no objections if you don't.

502
00:21:45,142 --> 00:21:46,893
We could use the extra hands.

503
00:21:48,851 --> 00:21:51,517
Why do you care so much
about how this place is run?

504
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:54,017
I thought that all that
mattered to you was Hollywood.

505
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:56,434
I mean, it would just
be temporary while I'm home.

506
00:21:56,517 --> 00:21:57,975
Oh, and how long's
that gonna be exactly?

507
00:21:58,059 --> 00:21:59,476
If I'm gonna
get drilled in the ass,

508
00:21:59,559 --> 00:22:01,768
I'd love to know the size
of the fella's dick first.

509
00:22:01,851 --> 00:22:03,726
Jesse!

510
00:22:03,809 --> 00:22:05,643
I don't know why the hell
you two are even asking me.

511
00:22:05,726 --> 00:22:07,351
Sounds like you
got it all figured out.

512
00:22:07,434 --> 00:22:09,309
Maybe Martin
should be your dad.

513
00:22:09,392 --> 00:22:10,851
You're being ridiculous.

514
00:22:10,934 --> 00:22:12,934
No, what's ridiculous
is you coming home,

515
00:22:13,017 --> 00:22:14,643
trying to act like
there's nothing wrong,

516
00:22:14,726 --> 00:22:17,184
not apologizing or nothin'.

517
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:20,684
Just do whatever you want.

518
00:22:20,768 --> 00:22:22,768
Obviously what I
think doesn't matter.

519
00:22:23,934 --> 00:22:26,309
Hollywood big shot.

520
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:34,975
Now stop acting like
this ain't a big deal!

521
00:22:35,059 --> 00:22:36,975
I got to live
in that town, Eli!

522
00:22:37,059 --> 00:22:39,017
You over there making enemies.

523
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:41,184
I'm done talking about this,
Baby Billy.

524
00:22:41,267 --> 00:22:44,225
Seasons is bitter
we're about to eat his lunch.

525
00:22:44,309 --> 00:22:47,184
What else could we do?
I got my own church to run.

526
00:22:47,267 --> 00:22:48,851
Well, I had him
until you threw

527
00:22:48,934 --> 00:22:51,017
a damn potato
through the man's window.

528
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:53,142
- Wasn't working.
- You know what's not working?

529
00:22:53,225 --> 00:22:55,975
You.
That's what's not working.

530
00:22:56,059 --> 00:22:57,476
Now, your kids are worried
about you, Eli.

531
00:22:57,559 --> 00:22:59,726
I'm worried about you.
What did my kids say?

532
00:22:59,809 --> 00:23:01,684
That you were
a walking Zoloft commercial.

533
00:23:01,768 --> 00:23:04,559
Just a sad sack.
Lost all your strength.

534
00:23:04,643 --> 00:23:06,392
You... you're weak.

535
00:23:06,476 --> 00:23:08,017
Oh, you come into town
and instantly try

536
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,684
to turn my family against me?

537
00:23:09,768 --> 00:23:11,809
Your kids offered
their insights freely, big boy.

538
00:23:11,893 --> 00:23:14,017
And my sister's gone,
you over here drowning.

539
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,225
Don't talk
about Aimee-Leigh.

540
00:23:15,309 --> 00:23:16,559
I'll talk about
her whenever I want to.

541
00:23:16,643 --> 00:23:19,017
She's my sister, Eli.

542
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:21,726
You ain't the only one
that misses her, you know.

543
00:23:21,809 --> 00:23:23,726
I think about that woman
every single day.

544
00:23:23,809 --> 00:23:25,934
Well, you shoulda done that
while she was still alive.

545
00:23:26,017 --> 00:23:28,517
You're trying to cash in on
her name every chance you get

546
00:23:28,601 --> 00:23:30,768
and were nowhere to be found
when she needed you most.

547
00:23:30,851 --> 00:23:32,726
I had my hands tied, Eli,

548
00:23:32,809 --> 00:23:34,684
with that whole Christian
cruise ship thing.

549
00:23:34,768 --> 00:23:36,726
I was at sea.

550
00:23:36,809 --> 00:23:38,851
It was impossible for me
to get back here for her.

551
00:23:38,934 --> 00:23:41,601
That nonsense never got off
the ground and you know it.

552
00:23:41,684 --> 00:23:43,559
Well, I-I was
busy pricing vendors.

553
00:23:43,643 --> 00:23:45,768
- You're a two-bit con man.
- Oh, a con man?

554
00:23:45,851 --> 00:23:48,267
Then why did you invite me
back in the fold then, huh?

555
00:23:48,351 --> 00:23:50,351
Because I felt sorry
for you.

556
00:23:50,434 --> 00:23:52,559
I thought that's what
Aimee-Leigh would want.

557
00:23:52,643 --> 00:23:54,059
I thought helping you
would make me feel better.

558
00:23:54,142 --> 00:23:55,184
I was wrong.

559
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:57,309
Well, I ain't no charity.

560
00:23:57,392 --> 00:23:59,643
I'm a commodity.

561
00:23:59,726 --> 00:24:01,309
I'm a known name
in this industry.

562
00:24:01,392 --> 00:24:02,726
You lucky to have me.

563
00:24:02,809 --> 00:24:06,059
How dare you see me
as less than what I am!

564
00:24:06,142 --> 00:24:08,267
You less!
That's what it is, you less!

565
00:24:08,351 --> 00:24:10,267
I shoulda guessed this
is what would happen with you.

566
00:24:10,351 --> 00:24:11,893
You haven't changed a bit.

567
00:24:11,975 --> 00:24:15,934
All these years, still as
pathetic as you ever were.

568
00:24:16,017 --> 00:24:19,476
P-p-pathetic?
Well, how 'bout this then, huh?

569
00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:21,517
How 'bout that?
I quit!

570
00:24:21,601 --> 00:24:23,975
How 'bout that?
Who's pathetic now, huh?

571
00:24:24,059 --> 00:24:26,142
- You are.
- You are!

572
00:24:26,225 --> 00:24:29,601
You righteous Gemstone dick!

573
00:24:29,684 --> 00:24:31,309
You pathetic.

574
00:24:31,392 --> 00:24:34,100
Don't call me!
I'll call you!

575
00:24:34,184 --> 00:24:36,434
I'm gonna pack up my shit
and get out!

576
00:24:36,517 --> 00:24:38,476
What else did he do?

577
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:40,809
Kind of a big deal.

578
00:24:40,893 --> 00:24:42,017
- He does?
- We got pads.

579
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:43,476
He makes sure
that you're okay?

580
00:24:43,559 --> 00:24:45,309
Tell me something else
real serious...

581
00:24:45,392 --> 00:24:46,643
do you pray?

582
00:24:46,726 --> 00:24:48,975
Judy, Judy, why do you
put lipstick on your teeth?

583
00:24:49,059 --> 00:24:50,975
I didn't put it
on my teeth, Jesse.

584
00:24:51,059 --> 00:24:52,851
God dang it, BJ,
you're supposed to tell me

585
00:24:52,934 --> 00:24:54,142
when I have that.
No, you look-

586
00:24:54,225 --> 00:24:55,851
- But usually,
because of my frame,

587
00:24:55,934 --> 00:24:57,476
they actually have me
doubling for women a lot.

588
00:24:57,559 --> 00:24:59,684
It's something they
call "wigging" because I'm...

589
00:24:59,768 --> 00:25:00,975
Wait, what'd you...
what is it?

590
00:25:01,059 --> 00:25:02,351
Because of my frame,
they have me doubling

591
00:25:02,434 --> 00:25:03,559
for women a lot.

592
00:25:03,643 --> 00:25:04,684
It's what they call "wigging"

593
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:06,184
because I'm
usually wearing a wig...

594
00:25:06,267 --> 00:25:08,100
Isn't that interesting?

595
00:25:08,184 --> 00:25:09,809
To be pretend to be a woman?

596
00:25:09,893 --> 00:25:11,476
Uh, well, to do a stunt.

597
00:25:11,559 --> 00:25:13,142
'Cause he's very manly.

598
00:25:13,225 --> 00:25:15,517
- Gideon, that is fascinating.
- Thanks, Judy.

599
00:25:15,601 --> 00:25:18,184
Not that fascinating
in my eyes.

600
00:25:18,267 --> 00:25:20,392
Either way, I won't
be doing it much longer.

601
00:25:20,476 --> 00:25:22,184
Industry's kind
of cracking down.

602
00:25:22,267 --> 00:25:24,392
There's been, like,
a big push in the community

603
00:25:24,476 --> 00:25:26,684
for women to be represented
differently now,

604
00:25:26,768 --> 00:25:28,851
so there goes a lot of my work.
Well, look at that.

605
00:25:28,934 --> 00:25:30,476
LA's got my son sad,
'cause he can't pretend

606
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:32,476
to be a woman
for money anymore, damn!

607
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:34,809
You know, representation
of marginalized peoples

608
00:25:34,893 --> 00:25:36,684
is a big deal in Hollywood.

609
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:38,851
So I'm sorry
for your loss of work,

610
00:25:38,934 --> 00:25:40,975
but I'm glad for the progress
that it shows.

611
00:25:41,059 --> 00:25:44,351
'Cause if a script calls for
a woman to fall off a building,

612
00:25:44,434 --> 00:25:47,184
then it better be a woman
pretending to be a woman

613
00:25:47,267 --> 00:25:49,059
pretending to fall off
a building!

614
00:25:49,142 --> 00:25:50,975
I get... I just get
worked up about it.

615
00:25:51,059 --> 00:25:52,517
BJ's always thinking
about other people.

616
00:25:52,601 --> 00:25:54,517
You know, I might be old
school, but I think that it's

617
00:25:54,601 --> 00:25:57,017
boys that should be falling
off buildings, not girls.

618
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:59,517
Amen. I mean, I also think
that people at the dinner table

619
00:25:59,601 --> 00:26:01,559
shouldn't be talking
about Hollywood Agendas.

620
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:03,726
That's my...
my personal thing as well.

621
00:26:03,809 --> 00:26:04,934
Daddy, where's Baby Billy?

622
00:26:05,017 --> 00:26:06,768
Wasn't he supposed
to be here tonight?

623
00:26:06,851 --> 00:26:08,392
Baby Billy went
back to Freeman's Gap.

624
00:26:08,476 --> 00:26:09,559
- What?
- Oh.

625
00:26:09,643 --> 00:26:10,851
He ain't around here
no more.

626
00:26:10,934 --> 00:26:12,184
Well, how long he
gonna be gone for?

627
00:26:12,267 --> 00:26:14,684
Don't he got a church to run?
Nope. He quit.

628
00:26:14,768 --> 00:26:18,893
I told him he was a con man,
and I think that upset him.

629
00:26:20,517 --> 00:26:23,267
I know nobody you all like
is around here anymore.

630
00:26:23,351 --> 00:26:25,684
Your mama, now Baby Billy.

631
00:26:25,768 --> 00:26:30,934
Guess y'all are stuck with me,
man with a stick up his ass.

632
00:26:31,017 --> 00:26:33,434
Walking Zoloft commercial.

633
00:26:33,517 --> 00:26:36,726
If you all got something
to tell me, say it to my face.

634
00:26:44,059 --> 00:26:46,601
Pontius, why aren't
you eating your food?

635
00:26:46,684 --> 00:26:47,893
I don't like this food,
okay?

636
00:26:47,975 --> 00:26:48,934
"I don't like this food."

637
00:26:49,017 --> 00:26:49,893
You don't like anything,
do you?

638
00:26:49,975 --> 00:26:51,142
The macaroni's dripping wet,

639
00:26:51,225 --> 00:26:52,643
like someone
poured water on it.

640
00:26:52,726 --> 00:26:53,934
No wonder you're getting
in so much trouble at school

641
00:26:54,017 --> 00:26:55,476
with that fresh mouth of yours.

642
00:26:55,559 --> 00:26:56,975
Pontius is trying
to go for the world record

643
00:26:57,059 --> 00:26:58,768
of who can get
the most detentions.

644
00:26:58,851 --> 00:27:01,601
Shut the fuck up, man.

645
00:27:01,684 --> 00:27:02,768
Come again?

646
00:27:02,851 --> 00:27:06,434
Shut the fuck up, man.

647
00:27:06,517 --> 00:27:07,975
Get upstairs right now.

648
00:27:08,059 --> 00:27:09,601
What, you don't wanna hit me
in front of everyone here?

649
00:27:09,684 --> 00:27:11,100
I didn't even say
I was gonna hit you.

650
00:27:11,184 --> 00:27:12,768
Throw a pity party
for yourself much?

651
00:27:12,851 --> 00:27:15,893
Go upstairs.
Now!

652
00:27:20,017 --> 00:27:21,726
Stop laughing, Judy.

653
00:27:21,809 --> 00:27:24,559
It ain't funny.
Sorry, that was a hilarious-

654
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:26,476
- It's not hilarious.

655
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:28,434
Sorry you all had to see him
talking to me like that.

656
00:27:28,517 --> 00:27:29,975
That's just
how he's been acting

657
00:27:30,059 --> 00:27:31,768
since his brother
decided to run away.

658
00:27:31,851 --> 00:27:33,309
Actions have consequences.

659
00:27:33,392 --> 00:27:34,934
Because of one son's actions,

660
00:27:35,017 --> 00:27:37,517
now the other son
is a total asshole.

661
00:27:39,851 --> 00:27:42,351
No, thanks.

662
00:27:48,851 --> 00:27:51,184
- Are you crying?
- No, you dumbass.

663
00:27:51,267 --> 00:27:52,851
I'm just trying
to get my head clear.

664
00:27:52,934 --> 00:27:54,142
Y'all just come out
here to make fun of me?

665
00:27:54,225 --> 00:27:55,684
- Kelvin did.
- Oh, yeah?

666
00:27:55,768 --> 00:27:57,643
So did you.
Stop, Kelvin.

667
00:27:57,726 --> 00:27:59,643
Daddy, I'm sorry
you had to see that.

668
00:27:59,726 --> 00:28:01,601
I'm just trying
to raise my sons in a good,

669
00:28:01,684 --> 00:28:03,476
Christian home,
but all my sons wanna do

670
00:28:03,559 --> 00:28:06,309
is just humiliate me
over and over again.

671
00:28:06,392 --> 00:28:08,351
Sons can do that.

672
00:28:08,434 --> 00:28:10,017
Apparently daughters can, too,

673
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:12,559
talking trash
about me to Baby Billy.

674
00:28:12,643 --> 00:28:14,392
Daddy, the only reason
we talked to Baby Billy

675
00:28:14,476 --> 00:28:16,351
was out of concern for you.

676
00:28:16,434 --> 00:28:18,893
Yeah, nobody wants
to see you sad, Daddy.

677
00:28:18,975 --> 00:28:21,351
Uncle Baby Billy was
worried about you too.

678
00:28:21,434 --> 00:28:23,184
Baby Billy's
a sack of shit.

679
00:28:23,267 --> 00:28:26,601
He always hated me for taking
your mama away from him.

680
00:28:29,601 --> 00:28:31,684
Daddy, I'll admit it.

681
00:28:31,768 --> 00:28:34,517
I pretend I like Baby Billy
way more than I actually do,

682
00:28:34,601 --> 00:28:36,517
but everyone seems
to like him so much,

683
00:28:36,601 --> 00:28:37,726
so I just go with it.

684
00:28:37,809 --> 00:28:40,351
Daddy, Baby Billy
might be a sack of shit,

685
00:28:40,434 --> 00:28:41,726
but I don't know,
Mama always taught us

686
00:28:41,809 --> 00:28:44,684
we should never
turn our back on family.

687
00:28:44,768 --> 00:28:47,476
Yeah, maybe you
should heed that advice.

688
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:50,392
Ooh.
Daddy's right, Jesse.

689
00:28:50,476 --> 00:28:52,267
You should heed it too.

690
00:28:52,351 --> 00:28:53,934
Get your fingers
out of my face.

691
00:28:54,017 --> 00:28:55,559
Anyway,
I wasn't that rude to him.

692
00:28:55,643 --> 00:28:57,601
I just told him stuff
he already knew.

693
00:28:57,684 --> 00:28:59,559
What, that he's a con man?

694
00:28:59,643 --> 00:29:01,267
Yeah, it coulda been
a lot worse.

695
00:29:01,351 --> 00:29:05,559
And I didn't say anything
about his wife or her teeth

696
00:29:05,643 --> 00:29:08,768
or her tooth or whatever
she's got going in her mouth.

697
00:29:08,851 --> 00:29:11,601
Aunt Tiffany's mouth.

698
00:29:11,684 --> 00:29:13,225
Right, Daddy?

699
00:29:16,975 --> 00:29:20,142
Oh, maybe I was rude.
I should go apologize.

700
00:29:21,975 --> 00:29:25,142
I-I should apologize.

701
00:29:25,225 --> 00:29:27,517
And my fuckin' beautiful face
would've made this church

702
00:29:27,601 --> 00:29:31,434
a cultural phenomenon,
but not now.

703
00:29:31,517 --> 00:29:33,601
No, sir.

704
00:29:33,684 --> 00:29:36,100
Eli and his big-ass ego,
he gets none of it,

705
00:29:36,184 --> 00:29:37,267
none of it!

706
00:29:37,351 --> 00:29:39,809
Well, you're gonna
show him, Baby Billy.

707
00:29:39,893 --> 00:29:41,267
Well, don't think
this doesn't mean,

708
00:29:41,351 --> 00:29:43,267
we ain't gonna
get your teeth fixed.

709
00:29:43,351 --> 00:29:45,267
'Cause we most
certainly still are.

710
00:29:45,351 --> 00:29:46,768
I don't care
if I have to sell

711
00:29:46,851 --> 00:29:48,142
every fixture
in this damn place.

712
00:29:48,225 --> 00:29:50,476
You, get on away from me.
Get on, get on.

713
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:52,392
I don't even
want you next to me.

714
00:29:52,476 --> 00:29:54,309
Take mine,
what I'm gonna take.

715
00:29:57,017 --> 00:29:59,768
Holy shit,
we got a damn invasion!

716
00:30:04,934 --> 00:30:06,643
Come on!

717
00:30:08,684 --> 00:30:12,017
Rip it all up, boys.
Go to town.

718
00:30:15,351 --> 00:30:17,100
Whoo!

719
00:30:25,726 --> 00:30:27,934
Yee-haw!

720
00:30:29,267 --> 00:30:31,017
Ah, we got to run
for our lives.

721
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:33,059
Let's go.

722
00:30:34,392 --> 00:30:36,142
Someone's here!

723
00:30:36,225 --> 00:30:37,934
Get him!

724
00:30:38,017 --> 00:30:39,267
Come on!

725
00:30:43,934 --> 00:30:47,643
Baby Billy Freeman,

726
00:30:47,726 --> 00:30:50,684
from the bottom of my heart,
in Christ's name,

727
00:30:50,768 --> 00:30:54,267
I apologize to you
and your wife.

728
00:30:56,601 --> 00:30:58,059
What the hell?

729
00:31:00,601 --> 00:31:03,351
Whoa.

730
00:31:03,434 --> 00:31:06,309
We got company.

731
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:12,726
Come out, come out
wherever you are.

732
00:31:12,809 --> 00:31:15,351
Marco!

733
00:31:15,434 --> 00:31:17,351
You think you can hide?

734
00:31:17,434 --> 00:31:19,351
Here,
behind these children.

735
00:31:20,934 --> 00:31:22,225
We know you're in here!

736
00:31:22,309 --> 00:31:24,267
Dear Heavenly Father
who art in heaven.

737
00:31:24,351 --> 00:31:26,643
Bring it down, boys!

738
00:31:26,726 --> 00:31:29,684
- You better pray good.
- Hallowed be thy name.

739
00:31:29,768 --> 00:31:31,184
Thy kingdom come.

740
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:36,225
Thy will be done on Earth
as it is in heaven.

741
00:31:36,309 --> 00:31:37,517
Give us this day
our daily bread

742
00:31:37,601 --> 00:31:40,100
Hey, boys.
Hey, over here.

743
00:31:40,184 --> 00:31:42,726
I see you.

744
00:31:42,809 --> 00:31:44,184
Come on out.

745
00:31:46,975 --> 00:31:48,392
Drop them bats.

746
00:31:51,975 --> 00:31:53,643
That means you, Stretch.
Drop it.

747
00:31:55,851 --> 00:31:58,559
All right, everybody.

748
00:31:58,643 --> 00:32:00,726
You line up here.
Get up against them shelves.

749
00:32:00,809 --> 00:32:01,726
Down!

750
00:32:01,809 --> 00:32:03,601
Thank God, Eli.
You saved us.

751
00:32:03,684 --> 00:32:05,934
Get them masks off,
so we can take a peek at y'all.

752
00:32:06,017 --> 00:32:08,434
Go on, take 'em off.
Take 'em off, come on.

753
00:32:08,517 --> 00:32:10,142
What were your plans tonight?

754
00:32:10,225 --> 00:32:11,684
Destroy a temple of the Lord?

755
00:32:11,768 --> 00:32:14,392
Look at you.
Just a couple of country thugs.

756
00:32:14,476 --> 00:32:16,434
Just thuggin' around,
just nobodies.

757
00:32:16,517 --> 00:32:17,934
All of you,
every single one of you.

758
00:32:18,017 --> 00:32:19,392
Just nobodies.

759
00:32:19,476 --> 00:32:20,975
Tiffany, go flag down a cop.

760
00:32:21,059 --> 00:32:22,934
No, we ain't gonna
call the cops.

761
00:32:23,017 --> 00:32:25,893
These men are here
on behalf of Johnny Seasons.

762
00:32:25,975 --> 00:32:28,601
We're gonna send 'em back to
Johnny Seasons with a message.

763
00:32:28,684 --> 00:32:30,351
Tiffany, I still don't
want you here for this.

764
00:32:30,434 --> 00:32:32,934
Now go on down to the food
court and get you a Cinnabon.

765
00:32:33,017 --> 00:32:35,517
- But I don't got no money.
- Well, stand by the counter.

766
00:32:35,601 --> 00:32:36,851
Maybe they'll give out
free samples.

767
00:32:36,934 --> 00:32:38,809
Go on, now.
Go, this is man's work.

768
00:32:38,893 --> 00:32:41,476
What you lookin' at?
Strip off them clothes.

769
00:32:43,017 --> 00:32:44,100
Pardon me?

770
00:32:44,184 --> 00:32:46,184
You heard me, Lurch.
Get naked.

771
00:32:46,267 --> 00:32:48,267
Well now... now,
hold on one second, Eli.

772
00:32:48,351 --> 00:32:50,100
Now, I don't know what
you got in mind here, but...

773
00:32:50,184 --> 00:32:51,768
Come on, you can move
faster than that.

774
00:32:51,851 --> 00:32:54,267
Them panties too.

775
00:32:54,351 --> 00:32:55,975
Lemme see bare bottoms.

776
00:32:56,059 --> 00:32:57,601
Let's see them balls.
Come on.

777
00:32:57,684 --> 00:33:00,601
The Lord has always been
on the side of the Gemstones.

778
00:33:00,684 --> 00:33:01,851
Always.

779
00:33:01,934 --> 00:33:05,309
Our enemies will suffer
His almighty wrath.

780
00:33:05,392 --> 00:33:06,643
You understand?

781
00:33:06,726 --> 00:33:08,392
Come on.
Single file.

782
00:33:08,476 --> 00:33:10,934
- Single file.
- Come on, ducklings.

783
00:33:16,225 --> 00:33:19,184
Now, you boys run on home
just like that.

784
00:33:19,267 --> 00:33:22,476
And tell Johnny Seasons

I'm sorry I was an asshole.

00:33:29,392 --> 00:33:32,267
I know you've been going
through a lot.

788
00:33:32,351 --> 00:33:35,726
I need someone I can trust
to run that church.

789
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:40,643
Okay, Eli.

790
00:33:40,726 --> 00:33:43,517

Hey, Keith.

814
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:12,643
What's up, Keith?

815
00:35:12,851 --> 00:35:15,684
Come to sink in with us, bro?

816
00:35:16,643 --> 00:35:17,601
Keith, no.

817
00:35:17,684 --> 00:35:18,809
- Oh.
- That was close.

818
00:35:19,017 --> 00:35:19,893
Yeah, it was.

819
00:35:20,559 --> 00:35:23,476
Kelvin here specializes
in youth ministry.

820
00:35:23,684 --> 00:35:25,768
Is there anyway you could
sit down with our daughter?

821
00:35:25,851 --> 00:35:28,100
- Hey! How old are you?
- How old are you, bitch?

822
00:35:28,184 --> 00:35:29,100
- 40?
- No.

823
00:35:29,351 --> 00:35:30,267
40-year-old virgin.

824
00:35:30,559 --> 00:35:32,517
So what? I made
a celibacy promise, big whoop.

825
00:35:35,017 --> 00:35:36,643
Recently I broke
into my husband's email.

826
00:35:37,017 --> 00:35:40,142
- Say what?
- She broke into Chad's Yahoo.

827
00:35:40,225 --> 00:35:41,267
Good lord, that is wicked.

828
00:35:41,351 --> 00:35:42,559
Some of the ladies thought

829
00:35:42,643 --> 00:35:43,726
they may have been hacks.

830
00:35:43,809 --> 00:35:46,392
Stuff about prostitutes,
and ATL?

831
00:35:46,476 --> 00:35:47,643
Whatever that is.
