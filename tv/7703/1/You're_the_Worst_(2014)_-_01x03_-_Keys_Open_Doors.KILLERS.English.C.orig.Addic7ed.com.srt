1
00:00:40,339 --> 00:00:41,923
Let's go.

2
00:00:45,945 --> 00:00:50,267

3
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:07,532
I love your shower.

4
00:01:07,533 --> 00:01:08,833
Yeah, it's a good one.

5
00:01:08,834 --> 00:01:12,751
Me and this hand nozzle thingy
have gotten very close.

6
00:01:12,752 --> 00:01:15,957
You're S.O.L, but trust
me, it's amazing.

7
00:01:15,958 --> 00:01:17,697
I use it.

8
00:01:17,698 --> 00:01:18,981
How?

9
00:01:18,982 --> 00:01:20,232
I shoot it up my butt.

10
00:01:20,233 --> 00:01:21,650
You do?

11
00:01:21,651 --> 00:01:23,069
Sure.

12
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:25,071
Yeah!

13
00:01:25,072 --> 00:01:27,406
What do you know?

14
00:01:34,998 --> 00:01:36,749
What?

15
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:39,668
You missed a step
in that process.

16
00:01:39,669 --> 00:01:42,588
No, it's just pee. Look.

17
00:01:42,589 --> 00:01:44,256
You sit to pee?

18
00:01:44,257 --> 00:01:47,143
Yeah, I sit whenever I can.
I love sitting.

19
00:01:47,144 --> 00:01:49,929
Sitting's definitely in my top
five favorite activities.

20
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:52,825
- What are the others?
- Eating things.

21
00:01:52,826 --> 00:01:55,568
Shutting stupid
people down verbally.

22
00:01:55,569 --> 00:01:56,902
Bubble baths.

23
00:01:56,903 --> 00:01:58,270
Masturbating.

24
00:01:58,271 --> 00:02:00,272
- Where's sex?
- Eighth probably.

25
00:02:00,273 --> 00:02:03,192
- What about sex with me?
- Seventh, maybe sixth.

26
00:02:03,193 --> 00:02:05,778
Yeah, no, sex with
you, then sleeping.

27
00:02:05,779 --> 00:02:07,029
Unless I have a flying dream.

28
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:10,300
Then you're seventh.

29
00:02:10,951 --> 00:02:12,952
What's your day like?

30
00:02:12,953 --> 00:02:16,172
You know, tedious
interactions with awful people.

31
00:02:16,173 --> 00:02:17,673
Weird. Mine, too.

32
00:02:17,674 --> 00:02:18,924
When are you gonna be home?

33
00:02:18,925 --> 00:02:20,889
My clothes from last night
are still in your dryer.

34
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:22,604
On the late side.

35
00:02:23,538 --> 00:02:25,231
Want to give me a key
so I can get in?

36
00:02:28,301 --> 00:02:30,019
Jimmy?

37
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:31,470
You using the hand thingy?

38
00:02:31,471 --> 00:02:33,806
Edgar can let you in.

39
00:02:33,807 --> 00:02:37,193
Yeah, but in case he's not home.

40
00:02:39,029 --> 00:02:42,064
Hey...

41
00:02:42,065 --> 00:02:43,315
Hey!

42
00:02:43,316 --> 00:02:47,133
I just meant a key to get my stuff,
I didn't mean a key like... like that.

43
00:02:47,134 --> 00:02:48,370
Okay.

44
00:02:48,371 --> 00:02:49,538
I didn't.

45
00:02:49,539 --> 00:02:51,487
- Okay.
- Okay. Good.

46
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:57,213
- But, I mean...
- God's sake!

47
00:03:02,302 --> 00:03:05,003
Seriously, what if I had, would that
be any reason to shit yourself?

48
00:03:05,004 --> 00:03:06,722
Yes.

49
00:03:06,723 --> 00:03:10,106
We've spent the last five, six
nights in a row together?

50
00:03:10,107 --> 00:03:12,678
'Cause you fall asleep after sex!

51
00:03:12,679 --> 00:03:15,514
You're like a fat guy
in an American sitcom.

52
00:03:15,515 --> 00:03:16,515
It's a key.

53
00:03:16,516 --> 00:03:17,683
It's a way to get in.

54
00:03:17,684 --> 00:03:19,652
No, it's not.

55
00:03:19,653 --> 00:03:20,986
It's...

56
00:03:20,987 --> 00:03:25,324
It's my freedom melted
down into a metal totem.

57
00:03:25,325 --> 00:03:30,079
It means that there are rights
granted and designations...

58
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,697
Designated.

59
00:03:31,698 --> 00:03:34,834
No, it doesn't. It's a...

60
00:03:34,835 --> 00:03:37,703
My God, you're right.

61
00:03:37,704 --> 00:03:39,538
I am?

62
00:03:39,539 --> 00:03:43,759
I must still be hungover.
Thanks for calling me out.

63
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,261
Momentary lapse of sanity.

64
00:03:45,262 --> 00:03:46,378
Jesus.

65
00:03:46,379 --> 00:03:49,181
Right, so... are we
gonna hang out later or...?

66
00:03:49,182 --> 00:03:51,267
I actually have plans.

67
00:03:51,268 --> 00:03:52,885
Okay.

68
00:03:52,886 --> 00:03:55,024
Well, as my grandma used to say,

69
00:03:55,025 --> 00:03:57,890
"It's only a walk of shame if
you're capable of feeling shame."

70
00:03:57,891 --> 00:03:58,891
See you later.

71
00:03:58,892 --> 00:04:02,228
Thanks for doing all the sex stuff on me.

72
00:04:17,046 --> 00:04:18,883
That's a frittata.

73
00:04:18,884 --> 00:04:20,998
It's an egg-based dish
similar to an omelet.

74
00:04:20,999 --> 00:04:22,601
I know what a frittata is.

75
00:04:22,602 --> 00:04:25,604
This one has leeks and goat cheese.
I saw the recipe on Rachael Ray.

76
00:04:25,605 --> 00:04:27,313
You're not supposed to watch her.

77
00:04:27,314 --> 00:04:30,725
The doctor said that your
obsession with her is unhealthy.

78
00:04:30,726 --> 00:04:32,861
I know, but every minute
that I'm watching her,

79
00:04:32,862 --> 00:04:34,279
I'm not doing heroin.

80
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:37,114
Except sometimes I'm
also doing heroin.

81
00:04:37,115 --> 00:04:39,584
- You know, she asked for a key.
- Who?

82
00:04:39,585 --> 00:04:41,839
Rachael Ray.
Who do you think?

83
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,290
- Rachael Ray could have a key.
- Can you believe she would do that?

84
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:48,606
- Well, I mean, keys open doors.
- It's not a key. It's a symbol.

85
00:04:48,607 --> 00:04:50,383
- Of what?
- Of the unceasing,

86
00:04:50,384 --> 00:04:53,709
inexorable march of everything
towards predictability,

87
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:56,192
blandness and mediocrity.

88
00:04:56,193 --> 00:04:58,587
It's the Rachael Raying of the world.

89
00:04:58,588 --> 00:05:01,892
A cozy world full of home-cooked
meals and graceful weight fluctuation?

90
00:05:01,893 --> 00:05:03,758
I'd live in that world.

91
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:06,595
I honestly cannot sit there
and pretend not to be

92
00:05:06,596 --> 00:05:10,599
horrified by things as
unthought-out and unspecial

93
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:14,037
as "Can I have a key," ruled
by nothing more interesting

94
00:05:14,038 --> 00:05:16,507
than animal instinct to the
point that I might as well

95
00:05:16,508 --> 00:05:20,442
be sleeping with a migratory bird
or a leatherback sea turtle.

96
00:05:20,443 --> 00:05:22,444
I'm gonna eat your frittata.

97
00:05:22,445 --> 00:05:23,778
"Can I have a key?"

98
00:05:23,779 --> 00:05:27,282
I'll tell you what...
How can you see this shit

99
00:05:27,283 --> 00:05:30,335
happening and just smile
and be okay with it?

100
00:05:30,336 --> 00:05:32,671
How do you look at the person
you're with and not just know

101
00:05:32,672 --> 00:05:38,126
that there's another person
inside who's boring and lame

102
00:05:38,127 --> 00:05:41,496
and will eventually ask
for emotional support

103
00:05:41,497 --> 00:05:45,634
and to shop together for decorative
sconces at Williams-Sonoma.

104
00:05:45,635 --> 00:05:48,470
How can you just ignore that shit?

105
00:05:48,471 --> 00:05:49,804
I don't know.

106
00:05:49,805 --> 00:05:52,634
Because you like them, I guess.

107
00:05:53,693 --> 00:05:55,560
Yeah, well...

108
00:05:55,561 --> 00:05:59,614
I don't know how to do that, so...

109
00:06:02,902 --> 00:06:05,987
Well, it makes sense
she'd be emotional today.

110
00:06:05,988 --> 00:06:08,490
I swear, if you're charting
her menstrual cycle...

111
00:06:08,491 --> 00:06:09,658
It's her birthday.

112
00:06:09,659 --> 00:06:10,825
It is?

113
00:06:12,295 --> 00:06:14,329
Why didn't she tell me?

114
00:06:19,585 --> 00:06:21,169
It's Gretchen's.

115
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:23,255
I better bring it to her.

116
00:06:23,256 --> 00:06:24,256
Hand it over.

117
00:06:24,257 --> 00:06:25,307
What?

118
00:06:25,308 --> 00:06:26,641
I'm not gonna snoop.

119
00:06:26,642 --> 00:06:29,177
I'm not!

120
00:06:29,178 --> 00:06:33,014
Aw...

121
00:06:33,015 --> 00:06:35,767
Aw, this is stupid.

122
00:06:35,768 --> 00:06:37,986
Y-You are stupid.

123
00:06:37,987 --> 00:06:40,488
I'm living with the
stupidest person in America.

124
00:06:40,489 --> 00:06:46,194
Me, the smartest, and you,
the stupidest, living together.

125
00:06:46,195 --> 00:06:47,195
You seriously think I'm not

126
00:06:47,196 --> 00:06:50,665
strong enough to break
through what... ten staples?

127
00:06:53,336 --> 00:06:56,871
Have a good day at school.

128
00:06:59,792 --> 00:07:02,093
You've got to be kidding me.

129
00:07:02,094 --> 00:07:03,295
You're doing a juice cleanse?

130
00:07:03,296 --> 00:07:04,462
You disgusting cliché.

131
00:07:04,463 --> 00:07:06,881
You're going to embarrass
me at my diner.

132
00:07:06,882 --> 00:07:08,099
Don't care.

133
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:11,686
Day five. Gretch, you
can't imagine the high.

134
00:07:11,687 --> 00:07:13,622
- Bet I can.
- No, you can't.

135
00:07:13,623 --> 00:07:16,026
Remember the time you and
Chingy snorted K off my vag?

136
00:07:16,027 --> 00:07:18,276
Aw... yeah.

137
00:07:18,277 --> 00:07:22,781
This one is almond, flaxseed and
something called "whey runoff."

138
00:07:27,203 --> 00:07:30,839
You don't understand how skinny the
wives at Paul's firm are, Gretch.

139
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,851
- I can't compete.
- So, don't try.

140
00:07:33,852 --> 00:07:37,548
Those Westside women are all overly
tanned garbage monsters with fake tits.

141
00:07:37,549 --> 00:07:39,931
Hip bones jutting out of their Lululemons.

142
00:07:39,932 --> 00:07:42,447
- That's exactly what they are.
- So screw 'em.

143
00:07:43,119 --> 00:07:46,245
Screw 'em, divorce Paul,
start eating food,

144
00:07:46,246 --> 00:07:48,971
move back to the East Side,
become goddamn interesting again.

145
00:07:50,201 --> 00:07:52,386
If it wasn't your birthday,
I'd be really hurt.

146
00:07:52,387 --> 00:07:53,145
Sorry.

147
00:07:53,146 --> 00:07:55,530
This Jimmy thing has me all freaked out.

148
00:07:55,531 --> 00:07:57,305
I warned you about him.

149
00:07:57,306 --> 00:07:59,524
I bet you guys talk about
me all the time?

150
00:07:59,525 --> 00:08:01,442
- How much it bugs me.
- Nope.

151
00:08:01,443 --> 00:08:05,205
Ew! You guys probably, like,
talk about me during sex even.

152
00:08:05,206 --> 00:08:06,519
You guys are weird.

153
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,910
I didn't mean the key
thing like he took it.

154
00:08:08,911 --> 00:08:12,522
I don't think I did. We're having fun.

155
00:08:12,523 --> 00:08:15,227
- That's enough.
- It better be. He is a bad person.

156
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:16,758
I'm a bad person.

157
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:19,040
Are you still seeing
Mr. Fancy Director Guy?

158
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:23,363
- It's complicated.
- Your life is so fun and complicated!

159
00:08:23,364 --> 00:08:26,106
My life used to be fun and complicated.

160
00:08:26,107 --> 00:08:28,430
- And now you're married to a banker.
- Paul is actually VP

161
00:08:29,432 --> 00:08:32,434
of Wealth Management and
Investment Strategies.

162
00:08:33,436 --> 00:08:34,517
- Idiot.
- What?

163
00:08:34,518 --> 00:08:36,865
There you are.
I'm sorry, Gretchen.

164
00:08:36,866 --> 00:08:38,408
Your phone keeps
going to voice mail.

165
00:08:38,409 --> 00:08:40,499
I left it somewhere. What's up?

166
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,548
It's Sam. He did an interview.

167
00:08:42,549 --> 00:08:44,587
Without consulting me? Who with?

168
00:08:44,588 --> 00:08:45,831
A college paper.

169
00:08:45,832 --> 00:08:47,090
And?

170
00:08:47,091 --> 00:08:50,949
He used the word "gay"
and "faggot" 37 times.

171
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:54,718
As in "faggot is a really terrible word"
and "gay people are the best"?

172
00:08:54,719 --> 00:08:58,085
The reporter is the president of
the Gay and Lesbian student union,

173
00:08:58,086 --> 00:09:00,409
and he's threatening to go to the Times.

174
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:03,772
Go. Breakfast is on me.
Happy birthday.

175
00:09:03,773 --> 00:09:04,761
Nice try.

176
00:09:04,762 --> 00:09:08,066
You still have to buy me a
present... cheapskate.

177
00:09:47,626 --> 00:09:50,044
Come on!

178
00:10:13,169 --> 00:10:14,569
_

179
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:16,621
Who the hell is Ty?!

180
00:10:24,698 --> 00:10:29,997
I stole you a card from CVS,
but I lost it on the way over here.

181
00:10:29,998 --> 00:10:31,273
This is serious, Sam.

182
00:10:31,274 --> 00:10:33,933
Inside, it said,
"You're not just getting older.

183
00:10:33,934 --> 00:10:35,983
You're also getting less attractive."

184
00:10:35,984 --> 00:10:37,682
You can't bribe me with flowers.

185
00:10:37,683 --> 00:10:40,848
It's a joke, because you're so
young and beautiful and shit.

186
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:43,819
What were you thinking, doing
an interview without me there?

187
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:46,691
To quote you,
"I get nervous at these shits."

188
00:10:46,692 --> 00:10:49,199
We were skating and messing
with college girls, and

189
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,003
this skinny fool comes up and says,
can he ask some questions.

190
00:10:53,004 --> 00:10:53,771
Were you high?

191
00:10:53,772 --> 00:10:56,483
It was 10:00 in the morning.
Of course I was high.

192
00:10:56,484 --> 00:10:58,959
And the whole time,
you did not notice he was gay?

193
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,126
Presumptively.

194
00:11:00,127 --> 00:11:03,179
Yeah, I mean, dude was
hella fruity, but so what?

195
00:11:03,613 --> 00:11:07,741
My generation... we don't act
different around different people,

196
00:11:07,742 --> 00:11:11,187
frontin' fake personalities.
We cool with everybody.

197
00:11:11,188 --> 00:11:13,640
Except Shitstain.
He don't like Koreans.

198
00:11:13,641 --> 00:11:16,682
'Cause of their manipulative
currency devaluation.

199
00:11:17,194 --> 00:11:18,395
And their eyes.

200
00:11:18,396 --> 00:11:21,615
You called the head of the LGBT
student union a "faggot."

201
00:11:21,616 --> 00:11:23,794
So? I call my pops that all the time.

202
00:11:23,795 --> 00:11:26,369
- Is your dad gay?
- No. He's just a faggot.

203
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:29,572
Well, now I have to go down
there and deal with this.

204
00:11:29,573 --> 00:11:31,825
And do your job?
No, Gretchen.

205
00:11:31,826 --> 00:11:34,654
From now on, when you
receive an interview request,

206
00:11:34,655 --> 00:11:36,673
spontaneous or otherwise,
what are you gonna do?

207
00:11:39,604 --> 00:11:41,561
Politely direct 'em to your office?

208
00:11:42,173 --> 00:11:44,984
Damn straight.
Listen to Honey Nutz.

209
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:50,760
Damn it.

210
00:11:50,761 --> 00:11:52,012
Hey.

211
00:11:52,013 --> 00:11:55,015
Hey.

212
00:11:55,016 --> 00:11:57,434
I brought your phone.

213
00:11:57,435 --> 00:11:58,652
Awesome.

214
00:11:58,653 --> 00:11:59,853
Thanks.

215
00:12:01,022 --> 00:12:02,022
Beep, beep.

216
00:12:03,024 --> 00:12:04,024
You got flowers.

217
00:12:04,025 --> 00:12:05,025
Yeah.

218
00:12:05,026 --> 00:12:07,027
Buy them yourself or...?

219
00:12:07,028 --> 00:12:08,028
No.

220
00:12:11,736 --> 00:12:13,655
Special occasion of some sort?

221
00:12:13,656 --> 00:12:16,703
People send me flowers sometimes, Jimmy.
They want to see me happy.

222
00:12:16,704 --> 00:12:19,036
- People like me.
- I know that.

223
00:12:19,037 --> 00:12:22,132
Of course I know that.
So, what are you doing later?

224
00:12:22,133 --> 00:12:23,960
- I have plans.
- Fine! Bye.

225
00:12:29,329 --> 00:12:31,721
Hey, can I get one of those?

226
00:12:31,722 --> 00:12:35,805
- These are pretty expensive.
- Don't be an asshole.

227
00:12:35,806 --> 00:12:37,351
Fine.

228
00:12:38,501 --> 00:12:40,013
You're boning my publicist, right?

229
00:12:41,495 --> 00:12:43,304
Used to be.

230
00:12:43,305 --> 00:12:46,282
Yeah, I Googled your ass.
I liked your book.

231
00:12:46,283 --> 00:12:48,701
Really?
Thank you.

232
00:12:48,702 --> 00:12:50,336
What did you like about it?

233
00:12:50,337 --> 00:12:53,126
Obviously, I thought it
was, like, boring as shit.

234
00:12:53,127 --> 00:12:56,276
And clearly, you used to jack
off to Hemingway in high school,

235
00:12:56,277 --> 00:12:58,795
- but the prose was good.
- Thank you.

236
00:12:58,796 --> 00:13:00,346
Enjoy your smoke.

237
00:13:00,347 --> 00:13:02,848
Why'd you used to be boning her?

238
00:13:02,849 --> 00:13:04,300
I don't know.

239
00:13:04,301 --> 00:13:06,769
We were never a real thing.

240
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:07,970
How come?

241
00:13:07,971 --> 00:13:13,109
All I know is, I don't let nobody
talk to me the way Gretch does.

242
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:14,465
Yeah, me, neither.

243
00:13:14,466 --> 00:13:17,822
Figure she must be pretty dope
if we both let her do that.

244
00:13:19,366 --> 00:13:24,654
- Are you going back in?
- Yeah.

245
00:13:24,655 --> 00:13:26,327
Give her this for me.

246
00:13:31,745 --> 00:13:34,215
Hey, do you know someone named Ty?

247
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:48,433
Then I was, like,
"Girl, fix your weave."

248
00:13:48,434 --> 00:13:50,262
- Darren Kaplan?
- Yeah?

249
00:13:50,263 --> 00:13:52,881
I wanted to talk to
you about Sam Halton.

250
00:13:52,882 --> 00:13:54,049
Maker's, rocks.

251
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:56,365
When you went into PR,
were you aware

252
00:13:56,366 --> 00:13:58,030
that you'd become an instant cliché?

253
00:13:58,772 --> 00:14:00,468
Snotty gay reporter is better?

254
00:14:02,282 --> 00:14:03,723
Shoo.

255
00:14:05,812 --> 00:14:06,812
What do you want?

256
00:14:06,813 --> 00:14:09,982
I just want to make sure my client's
words aren't taken out of context.

257
00:14:09,983 --> 00:14:12,277
Don't worry.
I'll provide lots of context.

258
00:14:12,278 --> 00:14:13,869
He's a moron.

259
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:16,989
He's not even old enough to drink.
His opinions aren't fully formed.

260
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:19,472
We're on the dawn of a revolution.

261
00:14:19,473 --> 00:14:21,585
You wouldn't run around
saying the "N" word,

262
00:14:21,586 --> 00:14:24,088
but people feel free to say
"fag" whenever they want.

263
00:14:24,089 --> 00:14:26,331
He says the "N" word
all the time, too.

264
00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:29,245
He called wheatgrass
the "N" word yesterday.

265
00:14:29,246 --> 00:14:34,223
He was like, "This 'N'
word is... hella good for digestion."

266
00:14:34,224 --> 00:14:37,966
- You got anything else?
- No. It's my birthday.

267
00:14:37,967 --> 00:14:39,503
I didn't really prepare.

268
00:14:41,348 --> 00:14:44,720
This is the point where I would
normally try flirting with you.

269
00:14:46,153 --> 00:14:49,021
Okay, I tried.

270
00:14:49,022 --> 00:14:50,679
Wait, that's it?

271
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:53,192
Look, I love my
client like the black son

272
00:14:53,193 --> 00:14:55,312
I aborted in high school,
but maybe you're right.

273
00:14:55,313 --> 00:14:58,831
Banning words is always the misguided
byproduct of good social movements.

274
00:14:58,832 --> 00:15:01,834
So, maybe his career
is worth the sacrifice.

275
00:15:01,835 --> 00:15:04,792
I heard Caliber had a big hush budget.

276
00:15:04,793 --> 00:15:06,518
I can give you two grand... that's it.

277
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:07,840
And he has to come give
me another interview.

278
00:15:07,841 --> 00:15:08,841
Done.

279
00:15:08,842 --> 00:15:09,842
Happy birthday.

280
00:15:09,843 --> 00:15:10,843
Thanks.

281
00:15:10,844 --> 00:15:13,409
Congrats on choosing a
dying profession.

282
00:15:27,197 --> 00:15:30,236
She can do whatever she wants.
Just go home.

283
00:15:31,335 --> 00:15:32,891
Or go in there and ruin her date.

284
00:15:35,088 --> 00:15:37,006
Yep.

285
00:15:40,678 --> 00:15:43,796
- Farts.
- Sorry.

286
00:15:43,797 --> 00:15:44,848
Lindsay, what...

287
00:15:44,849 --> 00:15:46,910
I'm saying, like, you can
tell, like, she just stuffed

288
00:15:46,911 --> 00:15:49,561
it into a bag. You know
what I mean? It's so sad.

289
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:54,309
- Hey, Jimmy, how's it going?
- Here, honey.

290
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:57,310
- Just...
- Hey, Jimmy.

291
00:15:57,311 --> 00:15:59,126
- Nice to see you.
- Do you work here?

292
00:15:59,127 --> 00:16:01,864
Can I get a double whiskey, neat?

293
00:16:01,865 --> 00:16:07,320
Jimmy, it's Paul, Lindsay's husband?
We vacationed in Saint Lucia together.

294
00:16:07,321 --> 00:16:10,573
- Twice.
- Just get him the whiskey, Paul.

295
00:16:10,574 --> 00:16:12,825
Go.

296
00:16:12,826 --> 00:16:14,724
I lost eight pounds
since you saw me last.

297
00:16:14,725 --> 00:16:19,832
- Can you tell?
- No.

298
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:21,151
So, this is creepy.

299
00:16:21,152 --> 00:16:22,053
I know.

300
00:16:22,054 --> 00:16:24,610
How could you not invite me
to your birthday drinks?

301
00:16:24,611 --> 00:16:25,838
I mean you just showing up.

302
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:29,508
- I thought you were on a date.
- How is that better?

303
00:16:29,509 --> 00:16:30,509
Why'd you think I was on a date?

304
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:32,511
Well, a text came through on your phone.

305
00:16:32,512 --> 00:16:34,265
- You snooped?
- No, I... I couldn't

306
00:16:34,266 --> 00:16:36,058
figure out your password, so...

307
00:16:36,059 --> 00:16:39,518
What are we doing, Jimmy?

308
00:16:43,991 --> 00:16:45,074
Happy birthday, you.

309
00:16:45,075 --> 00:16:47,739
It's from a winery in La Cañada
I'm a partial investor of.

310
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:51,632
Where the 2 meets the 210.

311
00:16:51,633 --> 00:16:53,727
Yeah, they say it's our
Rhine Valley.

312
00:16:53,728 --> 00:16:56,786
Thanks, Ty.

313
00:16:56,787 --> 00:16:58,609
Gretchen, this is Element.

314
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:01,674
- LMN?
- Element.

315
00:17:01,675 --> 00:17:07,077
- Like Oxygen, Hydrogen.
- Arsenic, Radon.

316
00:17:07,078 --> 00:17:09,427
- Ty Wyland.
- Sorry, Twine what?

317
00:17:09,428 --> 00:17:11,141
Ty Wyland.

318
00:17:11,685 --> 00:17:13,618
I don't understand
what he's saying.

319
00:17:15,522 --> 00:17:17,779
Grab yourselves drinks.
We're right over there.

320
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:19,976
We actually can't stay.

321
00:17:19,977 --> 00:17:20,833
We have a fund-raiser

322
00:17:21,361 --> 00:17:23,546
for this very promising
Guatemalan reform candidate.

323
00:17:23,547 --> 00:17:29,318
Heavily into Central American
politics, are you, Element?

324
00:17:29,319 --> 00:17:33,539
Well.
Happy birthday, again.

325
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:36,683
I need to see you. Soon.

326
00:17:38,412 --> 00:17:41,589
Nice to see you guys. Okay.

327
00:17:45,886 --> 00:17:48,221
So that's why you didn't invite me.

328
00:17:48,222 --> 00:17:50,166
Also, I wanted to spare
you Becca and Vernon.

329
00:17:50,167 --> 00:17:55,205
Homeslice! Get your balls over here.
What? It's Jimmy.

330
00:17:55,206 --> 00:17:59,519
You could have just told me it was your
birthday and you were hanging with...

331
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,923
friends.

332
00:18:00,924 --> 00:18:02,035
I wouldn't have come.

333
00:18:02,036 --> 00:18:04,671
It's not my fault my birthday
came two weeks after

334
00:18:04,672 --> 00:18:06,673
we started... whatever we're doing.

335
00:18:06,674 --> 00:18:08,675
You thought he was
coming alone.

336
00:18:08,676 --> 00:18:10,843
I didn't ask for any of this to happen,

337
00:18:10,844 --> 00:18:12,049
in this order.

338
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:17,717
You didn't do anything wrong. Okay?

339
00:18:17,718 --> 00:18:19,445
Look, I'm gonna go, okay?

340
00:18:19,446 --> 00:18:20,637
No, stay.

341
00:18:20,638 --> 00:18:22,639
What, now that he's gone?

342
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,856
Don't be a dick.

343
00:18:23,857 --> 00:18:24,857
Fine.

344
00:18:24,858 --> 00:18:28,611
But if I'm in danger of getting
into conversation with anyone

345
00:18:28,612 --> 00:18:32,649
really annoying, just
kick me under the table.

346
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:34,567
Deal.

347
00:18:37,955 --> 00:18:39,822
Hey, guys.

348
00:18:39,823 --> 00:18:41,240
This is Jimmy.

349
00:18:41,241 --> 00:18:44,577
He's a... guy I'm sleeping with.

350
00:18:48,248 --> 00:18:51,084
Jimmy. Sit next to me.

351
00:18:51,085 --> 00:18:53,636
Paul, can you get me a backup drink?

352
00:18:53,637 --> 00:18:55,505
Go.

353
00:18:59,259 --> 00:19:01,144
She asked me not to tell you.

354
00:19:01,145 --> 00:19:03,146
You're not my friend anymore.

355
00:19:03,147 --> 00:19:05,148
Can I still live with
you rent-free?

356
00:19:05,149 --> 00:19:06,149
I guess so, yeah.

357
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:08,401
It was good to see you.

358
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:10,943
Hey, guys.

359
00:19:10,944 --> 00:19:12,989
Nice pull. Bec didn't tell
me you were hitting that.

360
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:14,440
Because I had no idea.

361
00:19:14,441 --> 00:19:18,264
Jimmy, you got to see this photo
my colorectal guy just texted.

362
00:19:18,265 --> 00:19:19,612
- It's sick.
- No.

363
00:19:19,613 --> 00:19:20,613
Aw!

364
00:19:20,614 --> 00:19:21,614
Just...

365
00:19:21,615 --> 00:19:22,749
Your loss.

366
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,584
I'm getting us Jagerbombsters.

367
00:19:24,585 --> 00:19:27,120
Jagerbombsters!

368
00:19:27,121 --> 00:19:31,273
Did it even occur to you to tell me
that you're sleeping with Gretchen?

369
00:19:32,092 --> 00:19:33,392
No.

370
00:19:33,393 --> 00:19:37,217
You and Gretchen are poison people.
This is going to end so badly.

371
00:19:37,218 --> 00:19:38,681
I know, right?

372
00:19:49,643 --> 00:19:51,527
I'm glad you came tonight.

373
00:19:51,528 --> 00:19:52,979
Stop.

374
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:55,531
Tough shit. I am.

375
00:19:55,532 --> 00:19:58,818
You are growing on me,
Jimmy... Stupid-Three-Names.

376
00:19:58,819 --> 00:20:00,486
You're drunk.

377
00:20:00,487 --> 00:20:03,206
Thanks. Ditto.

378
00:20:03,207 --> 00:20:07,126
There is no way that that model
is as good in bed as you are.

379
00:20:07,127 --> 00:20:10,797
I know, right?
Okay, that's weird.

380
00:20:10,798 --> 00:20:12,331
Sorry about the key thing.

381
00:20:12,332 --> 00:20:15,134
Yeah, speaking of which, I should
probably take back the one I gave Sam.

382
00:20:15,135 --> 00:20:16,335
That was my main key.

383
00:20:16,336 --> 00:20:19,672
- You gave Sam a key?
- To give to you, yeah.

384
00:20:19,673 --> 00:20:22,842
Wait, so you wanted
me to have a key?

385
00:20:22,843 --> 00:20:26,012
No, I just didn't want
you to be mad at me.

386
00:20:26,013 --> 00:20:29,565
I'm not. I'm just
embarrassed for asking.

387
00:20:29,566 --> 00:20:31,818
Okay, good.

388
00:20:31,819 --> 00:20:35,855
- Wait, he never gave you the key?
- No.

389
00:20:41,528 --> 00:20:43,362
Shit.

390
00:20:43,363 --> 00:20:44,363
Hey, guys.

391
00:20:44,364 --> 00:20:46,365
What the hell are you doing?

392
00:20:46,366 --> 00:20:47,366
Sorry.

393
00:20:47,367 --> 00:20:51,504
- We needed a place.
- For what?

394
00:20:51,505 --> 00:20:52,505
Hey.

395
00:20:52,506 --> 00:20:53,752
You're gay?

396
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:55,923
No...

397
00:20:55,924 --> 00:20:59,101
but this nigga sucks really good dick.

398
00:21:02,142 --> 00:21:05,551
