00:00:02,484 --> 00:00:04,853
(sultry electronica playing)

2
00:00:11,427 --> 00:00:12,428
What?

3
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:14,296
You're losing your hair.

4
00:00:14,297 --> 00:00:16,585
What? Why would you
say that to me?

5
00:00:16,586 --> 00:00:18,701
- I'm practicing.
- Practicing what? Dying alone?

6
00:00:18,702 --> 00:00:21,485
- Being honest.
- Well, go and do it somewhere else.

7
00:00:21,486 --> 00:00:23,909
You're always so honest...
I admire that.

8
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:26,597
- I'm a giant liar. Always have been.
- Always?

9
00:00:26,598 --> 00:00:27,691
I told the Spice
Girls I was dying

10
00:00:27,692 --> 00:00:29,849
of brain cancer in order
to get free concert tickets.

11
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:33,644
Dishonesty to spare someone's
feelings belittles everyone involved.

12
00:00:33,645 --> 00:00:36,219
Dishonesty to get free stuff is
just smart economics.

13
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:37,554
Thanks.

14
00:00:38,355 --> 00:00:41,934
Oh. No. No, no.

15
00:00:41,935 --> 00:00:44,714
- Why not?
- I'm gonna get latex poisoning.

16
00:00:44,715 --> 00:00:46,432
Well, you can't leave
me like this.

17
00:00:46,433 --> 00:00:48,107
I'll be really quick...
you won't even notice.

18
00:00:48,108 --> 00:00:49,232
Nice try.

19
00:00:49,233 --> 00:00:51,467
I learned blue balls were a myth
when I was 12.

20
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:55,169
The boy that told you
that is a traitor to our gender!

21
00:00:56,273 --> 00:00:58,541
(water running)

22
00:01:01,711 --> 00:01:04,347
(grunts)

23
00:01:04,348 --> 00:01:07,817
(exhales)

24
00:01:07,818 --> 00:01:09,552
Wow.

25
00:01:09,553 --> 00:01:11,560
Look at you.
You're like an animal.

26
00:01:11,561 --> 00:01:15,246
- Like some albino gorilla.
- It's your fault, baby.

27
00:01:15,247 --> 00:01:19,029
- Walking around with that ass.
- You know, erections can be wasted.

28
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:21,336
- You will get another one.
- But I like this one.

29
00:01:21,337 --> 00:01:23,499
And I thought all Englishmen
were sexually repressed.

30
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:24,694
No, you're thinking
of the Welsh.

31
00:01:24,695 --> 00:01:26,708
So you're just gonna watch me then?

32
00:01:26,709 --> 00:01:29,577
- I literally can't look away.
- You're not gonna ruin this for me.

33
00:01:29,578 --> 00:01:30,309
Okay.

34
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:32,242
- Doesn't bother me one bit.
- Good.

35
00:01:32,243 --> 00:01:34,463
- This is gonna happen.
- Glad to hear it.

36
00:01:41,984 --> 00:01:43,586
- Damn it!
- Ha! I win.

37
00:01:43,587 --> 00:01:47,385
Well, anyway, I just started my
period two days early.

38
00:01:47,386 --> 00:01:48,909
- Oh.
- It's your fault, buddy.

39
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:51,394
You're the one who smacked the side
of the ketchup bottle over and over.

40
00:01:51,395 --> 00:01:55,164
Okay, well, so I'll see
you in five days or so.

41
00:01:55,165 --> 00:01:57,700
- What?
- Seriously?

42
00:01:57,701 --> 00:02:00,269
What, do yours last longer or...

43
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:02,338
Forget it. Don't worry.

44
00:02:02,339 --> 00:02:04,306
I'll leave the village
till my moon is over.

45
00:02:04,307 --> 00:02:07,810
Well, I could always
play through, as they say.

46
00:02:07,811 --> 00:02:10,340
Stop.
See you in five days.

53
00:02:39,843 --> 00:02:43,752
Ferris Bueller. Awesome.
What channel is it on?

54
00:02:43,753 --> 00:02:47,183
- It's not. I rented it.
- You rented it?

55
00:02:47,184 --> 00:02:50,920
Are you a timecop sent
from the past to kill me?

56
00:02:50,921 --> 00:02:52,945
You rented a DVD?

57
00:02:52,946 --> 00:02:55,698
I literally don't know where one
can do that anymore.

58
00:02:55,699 --> 00:02:57,760
Well, I noticed it was playing
at the revival house this week,

59
00:02:57,761 --> 00:02:59,596
and I realized I hadn't
seen it in a while

60
00:02:59,597 --> 00:03:01,664
but I didn't want to risk going in

61
00:03:01,665 --> 00:03:03,763
because of what happened
during Captain Phillips.

62
00:03:03,764 --> 00:03:06,469
This movie has one of the
greatest villains of all time.

63
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:09,171
Yeah.
Principal Rooney is so mean.

64
00:03:09,172 --> 00:03:12,794
- Rooney? Rooney's not the villain.
- Oh, you mean the sister.

65
00:03:12,795 --> 00:03:15,738
- That girl from the movie, um... Wind.
- Dirty Dancing.

66
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:17,566
Right, first of all,

67
00:03:17,567 --> 00:03:21,442
Wind is what you retained from
Jennifer Grey's career?

68
00:03:21,443 --> 00:03:23,052
And, no, she's not the villain either.

69
00:03:23,053 --> 00:03:25,054
- Then who is?
- Cameron.

70
00:03:25,055 --> 00:03:28,594
Cam... No, Cameron's his best friend.
Cameron's the sidekick.

71
00:03:28,595 --> 00:03:32,939
Edgar, I think I know a little something
about Campbellian storytelling.

72
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:35,744
Ferris is the hero.
Jennifer Grey is the foil.

73
00:03:35,745 --> 00:03:39,795
Principal Rooney is the fool.
Sloane is the sidekick.

74
00:03:39,796 --> 00:03:42,276
- Cameron's the villain.
- Wait, how's Cameron the villain?

75
00:03:43,173 --> 00:03:46,190
Ferris just wants to show
Cameron a fun day, right,

76
00:03:46,191 --> 00:03:49,812
for once in his pathetic
little life, but Cameron acts

77
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:54,416
like a whiny knob the whole
time, subverting every attempt

78
00:03:54,417 --> 00:03:59,722
at fun with his passive-aggressive
anxiety and relentless nay-saying,

79
00:03:59,723 --> 00:04:03,092
essentially ruining what might
be Ferris' last day of freedom,

80
00:04:03,093 --> 00:04:08,531
by being a-a miserable, agoraphobic,
cockblocking enemy of fun.

81
00:04:08,532 --> 00:04:11,167
Cameron's sick.
He doesn't even want to go out.

82
00:04:11,168 --> 00:04:17,039
But Ferris guilts him into it and-and makes
him steal his father's luxury automobile.

83
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,409
Are we even watching
the same movie?

84
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:22,878
I think so.

85
00:04:25,548 --> 00:04:28,572
So, Gretchen left.
You seeing her again tonight?

86
00:04:28,573 --> 00:04:29,631
No.

87
00:04:29,632 --> 00:04:31,679
- Tomorrow?
- No.

88
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,956
Oh, well. She lasted longer
than most of 'em.

89
00:04:33,957 --> 00:04:37,126
No, she's not done.
She's... she's on her period.

90
00:04:37,127 --> 00:04:39,128
Oh, good call sending her away.

91
00:04:39,129 --> 00:04:43,699
I read an article about how the drought
is pushing bears farther into town.

92
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:47,570
It's nice that Gretchen's
so cool about how you are.

93
00:04:47,571 --> 00:04:50,086
- I'm sorry? How I am?
- Yeah.

94
00:04:50,087 --> 00:04:55,035
Most girls, they want more from a guy, but
it's nice that this is all Gretchen wants.

95
00:04:55,036 --> 00:04:57,382
I don't... I don't
know what Gretchen wants.

96
00:04:57,383 --> 00:04:58,113
Have you asked her?

97
00:04:58,114 --> 00:05:02,918
I'm trying to watch a movie and have a...
What-what do you mean what she wants?

98
00:05:02,919 --> 00:05:10,659
This is my brand-new "relationship"
that I'm experiencing through me, okay?

99
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:13,128
So it's not for me to worry about her.

100
00:05:13,129 --> 00:05:15,988
Or, you know... you could.

101
00:05:17,976 --> 00:05:19,761
You are such a Cameron!

102
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:25,174
Mm, no.

103
00:05:25,175 --> 00:05:27,276
I'll try chocolate coconut
truffle next.

104
00:05:27,277 --> 00:05:31,328
Spiced chai.
Three times in one afternoon?

105
00:05:31,329 --> 00:05:34,383
Ew, do you think he boned my
sister that much?

106
00:05:34,384 --> 00:05:36,652
Can you imagine how
pinchy her face must get?

107
00:05:36,653 --> 00:05:39,421
(high-pitched moaning)

108
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:40,422
Ew!

109
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:43,139
That's my sister.
I'm gonna vomit.

110
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:45,917
- Raspberry pomegranate tart.
- Salted caramel pecan.

111
00:05:45,918 --> 00:05:50,153
Three times! Why don't we ever
bone three times in one day?

112
00:05:50,154 --> 00:05:53,302
- Where's he taken you?
- Black forest cake.

113
00:05:53,303 --> 00:05:55,407
-  Peanut butter rum.
- We don't go anywhere.

114
00:05:55,408 --> 00:05:57,623
- I told you, we're just having fun.
- Be careful, Gretch.

115
00:05:57,624 --> 00:05:59,629
Jimmy is a soul vampire.

116
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:02,144
And, face it, you don't always
make the best choices.

117
00:06:02,145 --> 00:06:04,680
- You're one to talk.
- Ha. Mean.

118
00:06:04,681 --> 00:06:05,914
Kidding, Paul.

119
00:06:05,915 --> 00:06:08,767
So, what flavors
have we settled on?

120
00:06:08,768 --> 00:06:10,035
Nothing for me.
I'm too full.

121
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:11,153
Me, too.

122
00:06:11,154 --> 00:06:15,574
I got to go to work. See you soon.
Stop worrying about me.

123
00:06:15,575 --> 00:06:19,728
Never. As long as Jimmy's in this world.

124
00:06:19,729 --> 00:06:21,697
Bye.

125
00:06:22,898 --> 00:06:26,135
You know, you're kind of mean to
me when Gretchen's around.

126
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:31,273
How can you say that?
Gretchen is lonely. We're so happy.

127
00:06:31,274 --> 00:06:32,836
I don't want to rub it in.

128
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:38,947
- I love you.
- I'm so lucky.

129
00:06:54,867 --> 00:06:59,306
Good work. Now, um, go away.
Picture books are over there, all right?

130
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:06,278
(sputters)

131
00:07:08,481 --> 00:07:09,882
You can't read.

132
00:07:09,883 --> 00:07:11,817
(chuckles)

133
00:07:30,337 --> 00:07:33,205
Nice try, dickhole.

134
00:07:33,206 --> 00:07:36,384
How dare you try and take advantage
of my new dumb-ass cashier.

135
00:07:36,385 --> 00:07:37,209
No offense, Philippe.

136
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:41,654
You know, it is disgraceful that my
bookstore won't support new writers.

137
00:07:41,655 --> 00:07:44,952
- Especially a local one of some acclaim.
- Really? Where?

138
00:07:45,419 --> 00:07:46,923
Haven't seen you in a while.

139
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:50,511
One explanation: you got some
new slizz you've bamboozled into

140
00:07:50,512 --> 00:07:52,255
letting you throw your pasty junk into.

141
00:07:52,256 --> 00:07:53,864
No.

142
00:07:53,865 --> 00:07:55,942
- She's not a slizz.
- Oh, what's her problem then?

143
00:07:55,943 --> 00:07:59,316
Humpback? Scientologist?
Did she absorb her twin's fetus?

144
00:07:59,317 --> 00:08:03,355
Nothing. It's perfect.
She comes over, we have fun.

145
00:08:03,356 --> 00:08:06,443
You must've come across that kind of
happiness... in a book, at some point.

146
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:08,950
Wow. I knew you were a dipshit.

147
00:08:08,951 --> 00:08:13,028
I was just heretofore unaware of
the true depths of your dipshittery.

148
00:08:13,029 --> 00:08:16,288
- Look, take it from a woman...
- Really? Sorry, where?

149
00:08:16,289 --> 00:08:18,928
Look, I know how people date, okay?

150
00:08:18,929 --> 00:08:21,659
But we both agreed we don't want
anything, 'cause we're different.

151
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:23,015
Oh, okay.

152
00:08:23,016 --> 00:08:25,458
Well, keep going with that.
See how long she sticks around.

153
00:08:25,459 --> 00:08:29,038
Hey, Philippe, from now on, you
see this guy, you throw him out.

154
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:30,893
And put his books back
on the loser shelves.

155
00:08:30,894 --> 00:08:32,198
All right, bye.

156
00:08:32,199 --> 00:08:35,401
Oh, and good luck finding
another job in six months when

157
00:08:35,402 --> 00:08:38,181
this place is a Yoshinoya Beef Bowl.

158
00:08:40,006 --> 00:08:42,537
I'm sorry if all that sexual tension
made you uncomfortable.

159
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:52,384
Jimmy?

160
00:08:52,385 --> 00:08:53,519
Jimmy?

161
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:56,155
All right, the official line is:
"My account was hacked.

162
00:08:56,156 --> 00:08:57,857
I have no idea whose vagina that is."

163
00:08:57,858 --> 00:09:00,229
But it was my vagina.

164
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:03,195
You can clearly see my micro-tattoo
of the Nickelodeon logo.

165
00:09:03,196 --> 00:09:04,697
It doesn't matter, Pepper.

166
00:09:04,698 --> 00:09:07,204
A normal beaver shot is just a
bad PR problem,

167
00:09:07,205 --> 00:09:10,302
but when a 16-year-old tweets it,
that's... repeat after me...

168
00:09:10,303 --> 00:09:14,073
- child pornography.
- You're so controlling.

169
00:09:14,074 --> 00:09:17,743
You're like my dad and my
step-mom and my manager,

170
00:09:17,744 --> 00:09:20,414
who's also my real mom,
and my TV dad Mario Lopez...

171
00:09:20,415 --> 00:09:23,171
Sorry, babe. That's the law.

172
00:09:23,172 --> 00:09:25,351
- What about my tits?
- Don't worry.

173
00:09:25,352 --> 00:09:30,138
We're going to roll out those tits
in a controlled, legal environment...

174
00:09:30,139 --> 00:09:32,906
like a very tasteful photo
shoot with Terry Richardson.

175
00:09:32,907 --> 00:09:33,926
Really?

176
00:09:33,927 --> 00:09:35,327
No!

177
00:09:35,328 --> 00:09:37,930
Maybe.

178
00:09:37,931 --> 00:09:41,333
- Hey, Edgar. What's up?
- Nothing. Oh, sorry.

179
00:09:41,334 --> 00:09:46,472
Um, I was just cleaning the house and
I wanted to return these hair thingies.

180
00:09:46,473 --> 00:09:48,913
Thanks, but I have,
like, a ton of these.

181
00:09:48,914 --> 00:09:52,378
- And some of them are not mine.
- Oops. Sorry.

182
00:09:52,379 --> 00:09:53,745
Oh, yeah, uh, while I'm here,

183
00:09:53,746 --> 00:09:56,739
Jimmy wondered if you wanted to
grab a bite to eat tonight.

184
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:59,318
Tonight?
Really?

185
00:09:59,319 --> 00:10:01,887
Okay, I'll come over after work.

186
00:10:01,888 --> 00:10:04,723
He'll meet you at the restaurant.
I'll text you the address.

187
00:10:04,724 --> 00:10:06,425
Wait, why didn't he
just ask me himself?

188
00:10:06,426 --> 00:10:09,028
- Oh, he's slammed at work.
- What work?

189
00:10:09,029 --> 00:10:12,107
Okay. I should go.
I have to try to find Killian.

190
00:10:12,108 --> 00:10:14,700
Oh, uh, and Gretchen...

191
00:10:14,701 --> 00:10:17,536
if you go hiking in the next few days,
you're gonna want to attach,

192
00:10:17,537 --> 00:10:22,257
like, some bells around
your neck or-or something.

193
00:10:31,925 --> 00:10:33,894
Excuse me.

194
00:10:37,063 --> 00:10:42,202
I didn't know what you liked, so I just
got you one of their "mixology" things.

195
00:10:42,203 --> 00:10:44,038
- What's the other one?
- Whiskey soda.

196
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:45,738
Yeah.

197
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:54,815
It's called a "reservation," right?

198
00:10:54,816 --> 00:10:58,707
Not a "suggestion of eagerness
to dine at a specific hour."

199
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:01,889
(laughs): Wouldn't fit on the Web site.

200
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:03,857
(Jimmy laughs)

201
00:11:07,159 --> 00:11:10,817
They could at least give us chairs, so
we don't have to crouch under this pipe.

202
00:11:10,818 --> 00:11:13,934
Ah, yeah.

203
00:11:13,935 --> 00:11:16,567
Oh, look, people are
taking photos of their dinner.

204
00:11:16,568 --> 00:11:18,939
Are they afraid people won't
believe they went to a restaurant?

205
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:21,375
- Hurry up, they're waiting for us.
- It's right over here.

206
00:11:21,376 --> 00:11:23,344
- Excuse you!
- That is quite rude!

207
00:11:23,345 --> 00:11:24,778
Okay, whatever, man.

208
00:11:24,779 --> 00:11:27,014
Come on.

209
00:11:27,015 --> 00:11:28,649
(both chuckle)

210
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:31,652
- Should we just go or...?
- Oh. Well, I mean...

211
00:11:31,653 --> 00:11:33,821
Follow me.

212
00:11:33,822 --> 00:11:35,956
Uh, great.
Um, after you, uh...

213
00:11:45,966 --> 00:11:46,800
Here we are.

214
00:11:46,801 --> 00:11:48,535
Sorry, what the hell is this?

215
00:11:48,536 --> 00:11:51,451
- This is our communal table.
- "Communal table."

216
00:11:51,452 --> 00:11:56,024
If we wanted to dine with total strangers,
we would have taken an ad out on Craigslist.

217
00:11:56,025 --> 00:11:58,275
Or invited our parents over for dinner.

218
00:11:59,514 --> 00:12:00,982
You're not dining
with them.

219
00:12:00,983 --> 00:12:03,280
You're just dining at
the same table as them.

220
00:12:03,281 --> 00:12:06,597
You're really cutting with a semantic
Ginsu knife there, aren't you?

221
00:12:07,455 --> 00:12:10,390
Oh, man. I'm so hungry.

222
00:12:17,698 --> 00:12:22,402
- $32 for pellizzoni? What is pellizzoni?
- It's a type of pasta.

223
00:12:22,403 --> 00:12:25,628
What is it made of? Bald eagle foreskin?

224
00:12:26,508 --> 00:12:28,757
Couldn't think of anything soft
and expensive.

225
00:12:28,758 --> 00:12:32,419
Bald eagles don't have penises,
they have a cloaca.

226
00:12:33,281 --> 00:12:34,948
- Thank you.
- Good evening.

227
00:12:34,949 --> 00:12:36,750
Is this your first time at Insouciance?

228
00:12:36,751 --> 00:12:37,484
Yes.

229
00:12:37,485 --> 00:12:38,886
Let me explain how
our menu works.

230
00:12:38,887 --> 00:12:39,987
Why? Is it electronic?

231
00:12:39,988 --> 00:12:43,457
(old man laughs)

232
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:45,859
You said you wanted to
explain how the menu worked,

233
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:50,497
which led me to the comic premise of
taking your sentence at face value.

234
00:12:50,498 --> 00:12:52,533
Never mind. Go on.

235
00:12:52,534 --> 00:12:53,367
Okay.

236
00:12:53,368 --> 00:12:56,270
Now, most of our dishes are meant to be
shared, so we recommend three dishes

237
00:12:56,271 --> 00:13:00,176
from the top half and, depending on your
appetite, two to three from the bottom.

238
00:13:00,177 --> 00:13:02,276
Can I start you off with bottled
water or L.A.'s finest?

239
00:13:02,277 --> 00:13:03,544
- Tap.
- Bottled.

240
00:13:03,545 --> 00:13:05,145
- Bottled.
- Tap's fine.

241
00:13:05,146 --> 00:13:09,183
- Just bring both.
- You have to try the uni foam.

242
00:13:09,184 --> 00:13:10,684
I absolutely will not.

243
00:13:10,685 --> 00:13:12,486
Are people allowed to actually
talk to other people?

244
00:13:12,487 --> 00:13:15,155
- Seriously, we can go.
- No, we're doing this.

245
00:13:15,156 --> 00:13:16,490
Okay.

246
00:13:16,491 --> 00:13:19,059
Don't worry, I promise I won't
order the pellizzoni.

247
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:20,661
Oh, order whatever you like.

248
00:13:20,662 --> 00:13:22,997
Though you should probably
have some iron, right?

249
00:13:22,998 --> 00:13:23,597
I knew it.

250
00:13:23,598 --> 00:13:25,165
- Man!
- What?

251
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:26,934
I knew I shouldn't
have told you about...

252
00:13:26,935 --> 00:13:27,701
Hey, how's it going?

253
00:13:27,702 --> 00:13:31,972
- Excuse us.
- Hello.

254
00:13:31,973 --> 00:13:38,078
Shouldn't have told you
about the... Detroit Red Wings.

255
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:42,249
How they're in town
for a five-game series.

256
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:44,151
I don't know anything
about sports.

257
00:13:44,152 --> 00:13:48,188
You mean... do you mean your period?
Wait, did I do something wrong?

258
00:13:48,189 --> 00:13:52,059
Yes! You were so weird about it.
"See you in five days"?

259
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:54,695
How is that weird?
When your...

260
00:13:54,696 --> 00:14:00,367
the series is over and the Red Wings
leave town to go and play more...

261
00:14:00,368 --> 00:14:02,503
- Hockey.
- Hockey, elsewhere.

262
00:14:02,504 --> 00:14:07,207
- The ice will be cleared to play on.
- That's not the point. That's a dick move.

263
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:10,572
That's exactly the point. Look,
if my favorite pinball game...

264
00:14:10,573 --> 00:14:12,366
Creature from the Black Lagoon in 3-D.

265
00:14:12,367 --> 00:14:16,277
Yes. If Creature from the Black
Lagoon in 3-D is out of order,

266
00:14:16,278 --> 00:14:19,941
I'm going to wait to come back to
the arcade when it's working again.

267
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:23,255
There are other games!

268
00:14:23,256 --> 00:14:25,281
Do you mean your butt?

269
00:14:25,282 --> 00:14:27,361
Shit!

270
00:14:27,362 --> 00:14:29,396
Oh, goddamn it.

271
00:14:29,397 --> 00:14:31,005
Should we...?

272
00:14:31,006 --> 00:14:33,133
Hey, hey! Jimmy.

273
00:14:33,134 --> 00:14:35,469
Hey! What the hell are you...?

274
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:38,238
I'm surprised you're
not on your honeymoon.

275
00:14:38,239 --> 00:14:41,417
We go in a month.
It's the busy time for Vernon.

276
00:14:41,418 --> 00:14:44,244
Old bags always want to get their
hips replaced at the same time.

277
00:14:44,245 --> 00:14:47,715
It's like, if one of them can walk normal,
they all need to walk normal.

278
00:14:47,716 --> 00:14:49,083
You're dining alone?

279
00:14:49,084 --> 00:14:51,952
No, I am with someone,
but she's not feeling well.

280
00:14:51,953 --> 00:14:53,120
Oh.

281
00:14:53,121 --> 00:14:55,622
Sucks, man.
Ditched at the commune tabes.

282
00:14:55,623 --> 00:14:58,492
Well, enjoy your
solitary dinner.

283
00:14:58,493 --> 00:15:01,028
- Honey?
- I'll be right there.

284
00:15:01,029 --> 00:15:04,618
Hey, wanted to say sorry about
the ruckus at the wedding.

285
00:15:04,619 --> 00:15:05,905
Tensions were high.

286
00:15:05,906 --> 00:15:08,346
Mostly on account of Becca's mom
being such a cooze.

287
00:15:08,347 --> 00:15:10,594
Oh, you were throwing your life away.
You were stressed. I understand.

288
00:15:10,595 --> 00:15:14,536
Word. Well, I should get back to
Bec before the amuse-bouche drops.

289
00:15:14,537 --> 00:15:18,045
She's been known to take down hers
and my bouche if I'm not quick enough.

290
00:15:18,046 --> 00:15:21,482
All right.

291
00:15:30,391 --> 00:15:32,659
There you are.

292
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:36,063
I've been looking for you
everywhere I could think of.

293
00:15:36,064 --> 00:15:39,366
Turns out, parents don't really
appreciate a grown man driving

294
00:15:39,367 --> 00:15:42,136
slowly past playgrounds over and over.

295
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,664
Don't you have a phone?

296
00:15:44,665 --> 00:15:47,798
My parents are afraid I'll turn into
a YouTube celebrity if I have one.

297
00:15:49,544 --> 00:15:53,347
(Edgar sighs)

298
00:15:53,348 --> 00:15:55,771
You okay?

299
00:15:55,772 --> 00:15:57,017
Yeah.

300
00:15:58,259 --> 00:16:00,565
He didn't mean to
forget you at the bookstore.

301
00:16:00,566 --> 00:16:05,125
It's just, sometimes people just
have weird ways of being friends.

302
00:16:05,126 --> 00:16:06,293
Yeah.

303
00:16:06,794 --> 00:16:09,541
In Iraq, we used to
have this translator, Zaid.

304
00:16:09,542 --> 00:16:11,265
Oh, he was so funny.

305
00:16:11,266 --> 00:16:13,667
We used to teach him Eminem
songs and make him do these

306
00:16:13,668 --> 00:16:17,337
lip-dubs, and then, we'd put
them up on the Internet.

307
00:16:17,338 --> 00:16:21,008
- I miss that guy.
- What happened to him?

308
00:16:21,009 --> 00:16:23,843
The videos got so
popular that the insurgents

309
00:16:23,844 --> 00:16:26,471
discovered he was working with
the Americans, so they buried

310
00:16:26,472 --> 00:16:28,964
him alive in the desert, and they
ran over his head with a tank.

311
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:37,708
My point is, not all friends can
be as awesome as Zaid.

312
00:16:38,192 --> 00:16:44,265
We just... have to appreciate the people
who love us while they're still around.

313
00:16:45,933 --> 00:16:48,796
Hey, you want to go get some
doner kebab?

314
00:16:48,797 --> 00:16:51,071
There's this awesome place on Hillhurst.

315
00:16:51,072 --> 00:16:54,208
- Does it have gluten?
- We can ask.

316
00:16:54,209 --> 00:16:57,177
Come on.

317
00:16:57,178 --> 00:16:59,446
Bye, Debra.

318
00:17:04,908 --> 00:17:06,076
Psst.

319
00:17:07,765 --> 00:17:08,932
They didn't see me, did they?

320
00:17:08,933 --> 00:17:10,067
No.

321
00:17:10,068 --> 00:17:12,743
- Ooh! That was close.
- I thought you were mad at me.

322
00:17:12,744 --> 00:17:15,017
Not compared to what a
disaster it would have been

323
00:17:15,018 --> 00:17:16,620
if Becca and Vernon had
seen us together.

324
00:17:16,621 --> 00:17:17,490
Oh, right.

325
00:17:17,491 --> 00:17:21,147
Well, then I'm mad at you. You just
ditched me at the commune tabes.

326
00:17:21,148 --> 00:17:22,714
Vernon.

327
00:17:22,715 --> 00:17:26,968
Are you seriously ready to explain
this whatever this is to anyone?

328
00:17:26,969 --> 00:17:29,081
Because I'm not. And I
wouldn't have almost had

329
00:17:29,082 --> 00:17:31,290
to if you hadn't taken
me on this ludicrous date.

330
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:35,294
Well, I thought I should.
You were so mad after the period thing.

331
00:17:35,295 --> 00:17:37,830
Well, yes, I didn't
want you to automatically

332
00:17:37,831 --> 00:17:41,541
dismiss me as a goddamn viable
human being to share air with

333
00:17:41,542 --> 00:17:45,346
the second I wasn't available for
sex, but I'm not, like, mad, mad.

334
00:17:45,347 --> 00:17:47,828
I knew what I was
getting with you, Jimmy.

335
00:17:47,829 --> 00:17:50,188
Okay, well... good.

336
00:17:50,189 --> 00:17:53,929
I'm glad you hate this place,
too. It's the worst, right?

337
00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:56,352
No, dude. I've actually been
here before. It's awesome.

338
00:17:56,353 --> 00:17:58,625
I love this fancy shit, just,
you know, not with you.

339
00:17:58,626 --> 00:18:00,800
Ouch.

340
00:18:00,801 --> 00:18:05,914
I just meant not yet, or whatever.

341
00:18:05,915 --> 00:18:09,649
I told you up front.
I'm... scared of this shit.

342
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:11,113
Right.

343
00:18:11,114 --> 00:18:13,521
And I don't believe in it, so...

344
00:18:18,315 --> 00:18:21,427
- I'm still hungry. You?
- I could eat.

345
00:18:22,943 --> 00:18:25,711
(indistinct chatter on screen)

346
00:18:26,412 --> 00:18:27,779
Ah.

347
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:30,682
This was a great idea.

348
00:18:30,683 --> 00:18:33,952
- God, I love this movie.
- It's the best.

349
00:18:33,953 --> 00:18:36,655
Ugh, I hate Cameron so much.

350
00:18:36,656 --> 00:18:40,508
- He's repulsive.
- No kidding. It's, like, kill yourself.

351
00:18:43,028 --> 00:18:44,496
What?

352
00:18:44,497 --> 00:18:47,241
It's Nothing. It's Nothing.

353
00:18:47,242 --> 00:18:50,454
- Did we get chopsticks?
- Yeah, I certainly asked for them.

354
00:18:50,455 --> 00:18:54,105
(paper bag rustling)

355
00:18:54,106 --> 00:18:56,750
Aha, there you go.

356
00:18:56,751 --> 00:18:56,608
Shh!

357
00:18:56,609 --> 00:18:59,436
- You be quiet!
-  How dare you?!

358
00:18:59,437 --> 00:19:01,816
- Turn around and watch the movie!
- Just mind your own business, you old cow.

359
00:19:01,817 --> 00:19:04,727
- Shh! God. Some people.
- Really.

360
00:19:04,728 --> 00:19:07,239
- Right?
- Want a beer?

361
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,505
Yup.

362
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:17,118
Mm. This is good.

363
00:19:18,997 --> 00:19:22,300
(indistinct chatter)

364
00:19:23,795 --> 00:19:25,330
Excuse me.

365
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:30,342
I have a large book club of ladies,
and we're going to be reading a book,

366
00:19:30,343 --> 00:19:32,455
and drinking wine... what...

367
00:19:32,456 --> 00:19:34,851
and I just want to make
sure you have enough copies?

368
00:19:34,852 --> 00:19:36,807
Fantastic.
What is the title?

369
00:19:36,808 --> 00:19:43,815
Congratulations, You're Dying?
By some guy with a weird name.

370
00:19:45,203 --> 00:19:46,153
Why aren't you typing?

371
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:48,065
So, you're the slizz.

372
00:19:48,066 --> 00:19:49,753
What?

373
00:19:50,223 --> 00:19:52,557
Yeah?

374
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:55,060
- What a bitch.
- I knew it.

375
00:19:55,061 --> 00:19:56,194
She didn't buy it?

376
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,836
No, so I stole this.

377
00:19:58,837 --> 00:20:02,334
(laughing): Oh, sweet.
I love this guy.

378
00:20:02,335 --> 00:20:06,738
I'm telling you, people that
naturally suspicious of humanity

379
00:20:06,739 --> 00:20:08,673
should not be allowed to do
customer service.

380
00:20:08,674 --> 00:20:11,743
No kidding.
You think Killian wants a cat?

381
00:20:11,744 --> 00:20:13,402
Who?

382
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:17,534
(manager whistles airily)

383
00:20:18,235 --> 00:20:20,940
Kerouac?
Here, kitty, kitty.

384
