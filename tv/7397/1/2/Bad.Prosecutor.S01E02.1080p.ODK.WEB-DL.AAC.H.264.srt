as you described.

Is this an illegal taxi service?

56
00:04:25,539 --> 00:04:27,109
- Of course not.
- Right?

61
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:37,620
Right? Of course.
Good evening, then.

62
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:44,760
This must be your first time
calling for a taxi.

63
00:04:45,359 --> 00:04:47,630
What name should I put
your number under?

64

Hey, girl.

72
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:23,430
I'm sorry to ask you this,
but I need a favor.

73
00:05:23,659 --> 00:05:24,659
Did you call me a girl?

74
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:27,799
- What the...
- Get back here.

75
00:05:27,799 --> 00:05:29,399
- Come here.
- Hey.

76
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:31,200

77
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,839
Hey, stop where you are.

78
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:35,440
You with the illegal taxi service.

so get back here.

No, don't jump the wall.

82
00:05:44,649 --> 00:05:45,880
I told you not to do that.

83
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:49,089
What the... Darn it.

84
00:05:49,289 --> 00:05:50,320
Why you...

85
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:52,089
Hey!

86
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:55,229

88
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:03,169

89
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:10,010
Move!

90
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,609
Out of my way!

91
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,209
- What the...
- Hey!

92
00:06:32,359 --> 00:06:33,700
He's exhausting me.

93
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:35,529

94
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,149
Gosh.

95
00:06:51,719 --> 00:06:53,589
Are you done running?

96
00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:55,289
Get over here, then.

97
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,690
Who are you people? Are you cops?

98
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:03,060
No, I'm a prosecutor.

99
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:04,459
A prosecutor?

100
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:07,430
As if I would fall for that lie.

101
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:10,469
What kind of prosecutor
comes to work dressed in that?

102
00:07:10,469 --> 00:07:13,810
Tell me about it.
I don't know what I'm doing myself.

103
00:07:14,339 --> 00:07:15,909
Anyway, we caught you,
so get over here.

104
00:07:17,909 --> 00:07:18,940
No.

105
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,680
Hey!

106
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:22,380
Don't do this.

107
00:07:23,049 --> 00:07:24,649
Not everyone can make that jump.

108
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:27,620
There's a good chance
you'll fall and die.

109
00:07:28,149 --> 00:07:29,450
- Get over here.
- Come down.

110
00:07:30,459 --> 00:07:31,459
Come on.

111
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,789
- I'm still panting.
- Maybe for you, but not for me.

112
00:07:35,529 --> 00:07:36,799
Wait!

113
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:38,729
Hey!

114
00:07:39,899 --> 00:07:41,270
Unbelievable.

115
00:07:44,099 --> 00:07:45,469
Did he actually make the jump?

116
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:49,570
Hey!

117
00:07:51,109 --> 00:07:52,880
You startled us!

118
00:07:53,609 --> 00:07:54,810
Are you all right?

119
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:57,880
- Help me.
- I told you not to jump.

120
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,450
Call an ambulance.

121
00:08:01,789 --> 00:08:04,089
What on earth
were you up to out there?

122
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:06,959
You were to do public service,
not break someone's leg.

123
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:08,130
What are you, a thug?

124
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:10,159
Also, who on earth is this guy?

125
00:08:10,359 --> 00:08:11,700
I'm Investigator Lee Chul Ki.

126
00:08:11,859 --> 00:08:13,200
I asked to be transferred here.

127
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:14,969
Give me a break.

128
00:08:15,529 --> 00:08:18,240
I see you have
a loyal investigator by your side.

129
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:20,839
If this is how it's going to be,
quit already.

130
00:08:20,839 --> 00:08:21,909
No one will stop you.

131
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:26,440
Is this your way of complaining?

132
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:29,109
Are you annoyed because
I told you not to do your job?

133
00:08:29,109 --> 00:08:30,680
That's right.
This is me complaining.

134
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,320
- What?
- Should I be honest with you?

135
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,289
I don't get
what I'm doing around here.

136
00:08:34,289 --> 00:08:35,789
This is all I've done so far
in this division.

137
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,159
(Motel)

138
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:45,329
Investigating an extramarital affair.

139
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:52,569
Tracking down a runaway dog.

140
00:08:52,569 --> 00:08:54,470
Who are you people?

141
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:56,110
You should go home.

142
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:57,880
Wait. Hey.

143
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,350
Please take him home. Thank you.

144
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:01,980
Getting a taxi for a drunk guy.

145
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:07,590
And chasing after a dog
that had run away again.

146
00:09:07,789 --> 00:09:09,350
Those have been my tasks.

147
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,360
Even the police substations
don't take care of these tasks.

148
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,329
Besides, why are the substations
making us handle these requests?

149
00:09:15,329 --> 00:09:17,529
And why are we
actually handling them?

150
00:09:17,529 --> 00:09:19,659
- Like chauffeurs on call?
- Yes, just like them.

151
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:20,799
Why?

152
00:09:21,569 --> 00:09:23,029
Because that's what we do here.

153
00:09:23,439 --> 00:09:26,270
I'm not making you do them
because I want to bully you.

154
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:28,569
You're supposed to take care of
those requests here...

155
00:09:28,569 --> 00:09:31,740
until you retire at the age of 63.

156
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,049
Do you know
the real name of this office?

157
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:35,980
The garbage disposal office.

158
00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:38,880
They want disobedient prosecutors
like you to quit on their own.

159
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:40,490
They can't exactly tell that
to your face.

160
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,120
What if I don't resign?

161
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,120
You will be doing this
for the rest of your career.

162
00:09:45,689 --> 00:09:46,760
Here are the civil complaint files.

163
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:50,860
(Our puppy ran away again.)

164
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:53,829
It's the darn dog again?

165
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,899
Darn it.

166
00:09:55,899 --> 00:09:57,840
That illegal taxi guy will sue.

Go to him and say, "I'm sorry."

169
00:10:02,169 --> 00:10:04,380
- What?
- Or you can resign.

170
00:10:04,939 --> 00:10:08,079
Beat it. Go already.

171
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:16,689
Did you find out anything
about the victim, Park Ye Young?

172
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:19,460
I haven't found
any hard evidence yet.

173
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,289
I looked into the surrounding areas
around her house, but...

174
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:23,600
But nothing?

175
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:26,559
Like someone had gotten rid of it?

176
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:29,899
And Kim Hyo Jun
still refuses to see us?

177

179
00:10:37,779 --> 00:10:38,840
Yes?

180
00:10:39,579 --> 00:10:41,850
Can I ask you something?

181
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:42,909
What is it?

182
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:48,020
In the backseat...

183
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:52,760
Imagine how desperate
I must be to do that.

184
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:55,289
I can't find a way to fix this,
and I'm stuck doing this job.

185
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:58,130
I should seek their help.

Ask him to give us a lead.

If you need to say something,
just spit it out and leave.

Now that you're in the hospital,

195

- you don't look too bad.
- That's...

196

up to the doctor to evaluate.

Hey, Chul Ki.

Be on the lookout.

on the lookout at a hospital?

Gosh. Don't kill me.

So let me get this straight.

222
00:13:42,529 --> 00:13:44,399
Park Ye Young worked
at a hostess bar. Right?

223
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:46,100
Yes. That's right.

224
00:13:46,299 --> 00:13:48,569
I was just delivering...

225
00:13:48,569 --> 00:13:51,100
No. I was just driving the car.

00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:54,010
And I know nothing about the rest.
I'm telling the truth.

227
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:55,270
Who is this "him"
in the text message?

228
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:58,010
He was just Ye Young's regular John.

229
00:13:58,079 --> 00:13:59,909
He buys her meals
and gives her some pocket money.

230
00:13:59,909 --> 00:14:02,110
She told me she had a sponsor.

231
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:04,319
Goodness. Come on.

232
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:08,289
Who was her pimp?

233
00:14:08,319 --> 00:14:10,390
- What?
- You said she worked at a bar.

234
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:12,189
Someone must have owned
the hostess bar.

235

Who introduced the John
to Park Ye Young?

Oh, that...

237

I don't know that much
about this business.

238

Oh, no. Be careful.

His name is Yu Jin Cheol.

He runs a few hostess bars
in Gangnam.

According to my intel,

256

he sets up big names in finance
and politics with girls.

why are you answering for her?

329
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,690
I see. I'm calling
from the security office.

330
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:51,389
I called because Mr. Yu has visitors.

331
00:20:52,059 --> 00:20:54,329
A lady from a gallery is here
to take her belongings.

332
00:20:54,329 --> 00:20:55,529
I called to check.

333
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:58,799
Mr. Yu.

334
00:21:02,029 --> 00:21:03,230
He said you could let them in.

335
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,000
Driver Kim, you can stay here.

336
00:21:08,039 --> 00:21:10,440
We came by taxi.
Why am I Driver Kim?

337
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:27,690
Driver Kim will wait here.

338
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:30,490
Thank you.

339
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:35,970
I'll help you find your belongings.

340
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,539
It's okay.

341
00:21:38,539 --> 00:21:41,410
It would be faster
if two people looked for them.

342
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:43,569
Do you think you can handle it?

343
00:21:44,609 --> 00:21:45,609
Pardon?

344
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:51,819
This is a private space
for Jin Cheol and me.

He's not in his office at the moment.

I'm so annoyed already.
I can't believe this.

that it was a rhetorical question.

You're not in a position
to ask me that right now.

He was the last one
to meet the victim that day.

That makes him the prime suspect...

00:32:30,476 --> 00:32:32,645
can't be brought up
based on a photo like this.

496
00:32:32,786 --> 00:32:34,946
We need something explosive
that'll justify the action.

497
00:32:36,486 --> 00:32:39,256
Like a witness statement
from the man who took the photo.

498
00:32:39,486 --> 00:32:41,186
(Statement of Facts)

499
00:32:41,186 --> 00:32:44,155
Write down the nature
of his relationship with her.

500
00:32:44,395 --> 00:32:47,196
Also, state what you saw and heard
on the day of the murder.

501
00:32:49,436 --> 00:32:51,966
Grab your chance to escape
when it presents itself.

502
00:32:51,966 --> 00:32:53,536
Why is there a need
to weigh your options?

503
00:32:54,105 --> 00:32:56,676
Shouldn't you care about
saving yourself first?

504
00:33:00,776 --> 00:33:01,905
Prosecutor Jin?

505
00:33:04,375 --> 00:33:05,885
We have
a search and seizure warrant.

506
00:33:07,686 --> 00:33:08,885
(Search and Seizure Warrant)

507
00:33:09,155 --> 00:33:10,415
What are the charges?

508
00:33:10,415 --> 00:33:11,615
Aggravated assault.

509
00:33:12,315 --> 00:33:15,756
CEO Kim Hyung Gyun of Rich Fund
pressed charges against you.

510
00:33:17,825 --> 00:33:19,226
You should've listened to me.

511
00:33:22,165 --> 00:33:23,196
Execute the warrant.

512
00:33:23,996 --> 00:33:25,766
On whose authority?

513
00:33:27,305 --> 00:33:29,875
How dare you cause a scene
at this late hour.

514
00:33:33,105 --> 00:33:34,645
Don't you know
that I rule this place?

515
00:33:35,946 --> 00:33:38,476
What happens here
will be dealt with internally.

516
00:33:38,915 --> 00:33:41,615
That's the rule I established
when I first took charge of this office.

517
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:43,585
It's the same with people.

518
00:33:43,655 --> 00:33:45,016
Anyone who works here
is considered family,

519
00:33:45,055 --> 00:33:47,655
and I won't let others
take my family away.

520
00:33:48,226 --> 00:33:49,256
Now, get lost.

521
00:33:49,926 --> 00:33:51,026
Sir.

522
00:33:52,125 --> 00:33:53,526
We knew you'd come through for us.

523
00:33:54,796 --> 00:33:55,996
Got it.

524
00:33:59,665 --> 00:34:01,266
I hear such a rule doesn't exist.

525
00:34:01,536 --> 00:34:02,605
Is that so?

526
00:34:03,706 --> 00:34:04,936
Then there's nothing I can do.

527
00:34:06,375 --> 00:34:08,805
What... What do you mean by that?

528
00:34:09,516 --> 00:34:10,676
Get searching.

529
00:34:13,046 --> 00:34:14,216
Shall we?

530
00:34:15,546 --> 00:34:17,315
I found you to be violent as well.

531
00:34:17,315 --> 00:34:20,125
Can you let me through? Gosh.

532
00:34:26,966 --> 00:34:28,125
Yu Jin Cheol.

533
00:34:35,506 --> 00:34:38,076
We'll soon see each other again.

534
00:34:38,335 --> 00:34:39,576
Whatever.

535
00:34:39,806 --> 00:34:40,975
I mean it.

536
00:34:41,776 --> 00:34:43,315
I always catch who I'm after.

537
00:34:43,875 --> 00:34:45,616
No matter what it takes.

538
00:34:53,125 --> 00:34:54,285
Let's go.

539
00:35:20,216 --> 00:35:22,386
Get Yu Jin Cheol to China.

540
00:35:23,185 --> 00:35:25,716
Out of Tae Ho's and Jin Jung's reach.

541
00:35:26,656 --> 00:35:27,756
Yes, sir.

542
00:35:40,935 --> 00:35:43,205
Kim Tae Ho, you darn twerp.

543
00:35:44,335 --> 00:35:47,546
Prosecutor Jin
had Yu Jin Cheol in custody...

544
00:35:47,546 --> 00:35:49,645
but Prosecutor Oh had him released?

545
00:35:49,716 --> 00:35:52,685
Prosecutor Oh is receiving orders
from Deputy Chief Lee.

546
00:35:53,116 --> 00:35:55,685
What you said seemed to be right.

547
00:35:55,685 --> 00:35:57,085
There is a connection...

548
00:35:57,085 --> 00:35:59,355
between the deputy chief
and the owner of the hostess bar.

549
00:36:02,156 --> 00:36:04,855
Why did Prosecutor Jin
go after Yu Jin Cheol though?

550
00:36:04,855 --> 00:36:07,966
I don't think it was
to get him off the streets.

551
00:36:09,495 --> 00:36:11,696
Jin Jung's after the deputy chief?

552
00:36:12,565 --> 00:36:13,906
It seems like...

553
00:36:13,906 --> 00:36:16,806
Prosecutor Jin is still looking into
the Seocho-dong murder.

554
00:36:17,176 --> 00:36:19,806
I'll talk to him
once we wrap things up.

555
00:36:19,806 --> 00:36:21,475
The details...

556
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:29,685
How dare you target someone
to build an investigation?

557
00:36:29,685 --> 00:36:32,015
You think you call
the shots around here?

558
00:36:35,125 --> 00:36:38,026
Your inauguration ceremony
is tomorrow.

559
00:36:38,026 --> 00:36:40,495
I was going to report my findings
once I was done.

560
00:36:40,495 --> 00:36:42,526
You must always have
the last word, don't you?

561
00:36:43,366 --> 00:36:45,665
I've had enough of you
looking down on me.

562
00:36:45,665 --> 00:36:47,535
As if I wouldn't know...

563
00:36:47,866 --> 00:36:49,136
why you're looking into Yu Jin Cheol.

564
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:52,335
Just you wait and see.

565
00:36:52,806 --> 00:36:55,745
Once I'm the district head prosecutor,
you will be the first one I get rid of.

566
00:37:02,756 --> 00:37:04,915
I shouldn't have let you see that.

567
00:37:06,926 --> 00:37:08,355
Forget it ever happened.

568
00:37:21,765 --> 00:37:22,875
(Interrogation Room)

569
00:37:24,276 --> 00:37:25,676
I apologize, Prosecutor Shin,

570
00:37:25,806 --> 00:37:29,645
but Prosecutor Oh said
not to let just anyone in.

571
00:37:30,546 --> 00:37:33,515
Do I seem like just "anyone" to you?

572
00:37:35,285 --> 00:37:37,156
I'll ask you once again nicely.

573
00:37:38,986 --> 00:37:40,185
Move.

574
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:48,995
I'll cut right to the chase.

575
00:37:49,265 --> 00:37:52,366
Let's go after
Deputy Chief Lee together.

576
00:37:52,736 --> 00:37:54,835
Promise me that you will help
me and Senior Prosecutor Kim.

577
00:37:54,835 --> 00:37:56,236
Then I'll help you
get out of here now.

578
00:37:58,035 --> 00:37:59,605
Then let's make one thing clear.

579
00:38:00,506 --> 00:38:03,515
That we will do everything my way
starting now.

580
00:38:05,776 --> 00:38:06,815
I'm in.

581
00:38:10,855 --> 00:38:11,915
Gosh.

583
00:38:17,596 --> 00:38:19,426
- Hello.
- You can leave now.

584
00:38:20,366 --> 00:38:21,995
And I need to check something.

585
00:38:22,935 --> 00:38:24,236
But play it cool.

586
00:38:24,296 --> 00:38:25,835
Darn it.

587
00:39:00,035 --> 00:39:01,035
What's wrong?

588
00:39:03,176 --> 00:39:04,435
- You can't breathe?
- No.

589
00:39:04,506 --> 00:39:05,636
Why can't you breathe?

590
00:39:06,645 --> 00:39:08,546
You can't breathe? What's wrong?

591
00:39:10,645 --> 00:39:11,975
(Emergency staircase)

592
00:39:17,455 --> 00:39:19,656
I think I'm okay now. I feel better.

593
00:39:19,785 --> 00:39:21,526
You saved my life. Seriously.

594
00:39:21,526 --> 00:39:22,556
Thank you.

595
00:39:24,326 --> 00:39:25,355
Shouldn't you go see a doctor?

596
00:39:29,096 --> 00:39:30,565
I finally understand...

597
00:39:30,565 --> 00:39:32,565
why you arrested Yu Jin Cheol.

598
00:39:33,636 --> 00:39:35,335
What's the point of going through
all that trouble to arrest him?

599
00:39:35,335 --> 00:39:36,806
They cut him loose right away.

600
00:39:37,705 --> 00:39:39,136
Now that Yu Jin Cheol is exposed,

601
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:41,875
Deputy Chief Lee
won't just sit back and watch.

602
00:39:41,875 --> 00:39:43,375
He will try to bury the case...

603
00:39:43,375 --> 00:39:45,375
and ship Yu Jin Cheol
out of the country.

604
00:39:46,285 --> 00:39:47,846
Don't even think about getting help
from the police.

605
00:39:47,846 --> 00:39:50,415
Who's going to disobey him?
He'll be the district head tomorrow.

606
00:39:51,415 --> 00:39:53,285
Okay. Let's make a call first.

607
00:39:53,486 --> 00:39:54,526
A call?

608
00:39:54,955 --> 00:39:56,796
There's no point in wasting time.
Let's catch him now.

609
00:40:01,526 --> 00:40:02,966
- Hey, Prosecutor Jin.
- Hey.

610
00:40:03,736 --> 00:40:04,935
I'm on my way. Get him.

611
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:07,165
- Let's go.
- Now?

(Motel Uraejang)

613
00:40:11,636 --> 00:40:13,105
You had him followed?

614
00:40:13,346 --> 00:40:14,446
Hey, that's against...

615
00:40:14,446 --> 00:40:16,515
Don't be so unreasonable.
We just started.

616
00:40:17,276 --> 00:40:18,846
You agreed to let me do it my way.

617
00:40:19,946 --> 00:40:21,815
I knew it.
You and I will never see eye to eye.

618
00:40:22,216 --> 00:40:23,616
We'll see eye to eye
if we face each other.

619
00:40:24,415 --> 00:40:25,955
But let's look straight for now.

620

(Uraejang Bathhouse)

622
00:41:04,756 --> 00:41:06,156
Gosh. What do we do?

623
00:41:31,742 --> 00:41:33,012
So he already got away?

624
00:41:38,223 --> 00:41:39,223
Hello?

625
00:41:41,223 --> 00:41:43,652
What? Yes.

626
00:41:45,692 --> 00:41:47,893
I think he figured out
that we were tailing him.

627
00:41:48,962 --> 00:41:51,563
I found this in the microwave.
I didn't find anything else.

628
00:41:52,203 --> 00:41:54,003
He suddenly became so meticulous.

629
00:41:54,833 --> 00:41:56,003
It was Oh Do Hwan.

630
00:41:56,703 --> 00:41:59,072
Someone had to handle him
until he left the country.

631
00:42:01,742 --> 00:42:04,183
Searching for the target now.

632
00:42:07,282 --> 00:42:08,953
By the way, who are they?

633
00:42:09,083 --> 00:42:10,152
I'll explain later.

634
00:42:10,753 --> 00:42:12,853
- Let's go with plan B.
- We have plan B?

635
00:42:12,853 --> 00:42:16,023
The target has entered
Gyeongin Expressway.

636
00:42:18,563 --> 00:42:19,563
Yu Jin Cheol.

637
00:42:23,563 --> 00:42:25,733
We'll soon see each other again.

638
00:42:25,902 --> 00:42:27,402
If you were going
to track him with that,

639
00:42:27,402 --> 00:42:28,802
why did you make us tail him?

640
00:42:32,143 --> 00:42:34,373
If he's on Gyeongin Expressway,
he's heading to Incheon.

If he continues on this road...

00:42:36,712 --> 00:42:39,342

He's going to stow away on a ship.

00:44:07,433 --> 00:44:08,503
What's going on?

657
00:44:08,503 --> 00:44:09,833
Let me check the vehicle.

658
00:44:11,273 --> 00:44:13,043
What? He's not there?

659
00:44:23,853 --> 00:44:25,623
What are you doing? Gosh.

660
00:44:28,552 --> 00:44:29,592
What's this?

661
00:44:34,233 --> 00:44:36,063
Come on. Darn it.

662
00:44:42,473 --> 00:44:44,802
(Yeonin Fishery)

663
00:44:45,672 --> 00:44:47,543
I'll call you right away...

664
00:44:47,543 --> 00:44:48,942
once Deputy Chief Lee
becomes the district head.

665
00:44:48,942 --> 00:44:50,442
You must keep a low profile
until then.

666
00:44:50,442 --> 00:44:52,242
Listen.

667
00:44:53,342 --> 00:44:55,483
Why must I leave the country?

668
00:44:56,313 --> 00:44:57,753
How can I trust you guys?

669
00:45:01,623 --> 00:45:03,353
I need to talk to him directly.

670
00:45:03,992 --> 00:45:05,023
Turn the car around.

671
00:45:07,192 --> 00:45:09,092
I told you to turn
the car around, you jerk!

672
00:45:13,262 --> 00:45:14,672
You little... Hey!

673
00:45:15,172 --> 00:45:17,233
Listen to me carefully, Mr. Yu.

674
00:45:18,302 --> 00:45:20,342
We're not doing this
for Deputy Chief Lee's sake.

675
00:45:20,473 --> 00:45:22,442
We're doing this for you.

676
00:45:22,442 --> 00:45:25,512
I couldn't care less
about your relationship with him.

677
00:45:25,512 --> 00:45:28,453
But if I turn the car around now,

678
00:45:28,813 --> 00:45:30,552
you will be heading...

679
00:45:31,782 --> 00:45:33,322
to prison.

680
00:45:35,552 --> 00:45:37,793
Gosh. I'm too chatty, aren't I?

681
00:45:39,692 --> 00:45:41,092
I'll get going now.

682
00:45:49,833 --> 00:45:51,973
I'm certain we're missing something.

683
00:45:52,742 --> 00:45:54,003
What could that be?

684
00:45:54,103 --> 00:45:56,172
What do you think
about asking for help?

685
00:45:56,913 --> 00:45:58,143
Do you want me to put out an APB?

686
00:45:58,712 --> 00:46:00,483
I doubt Deputy Chief Lee
will just let me do that.

687
00:46:00,483 --> 00:46:02,353
I need a warrant first
to put out an APB.

688
00:46:03,282 --> 00:46:05,123
Right. The APB.

689
00:46:06,782 --> 00:46:08,223
Not you too.

690
00:46:08,223 --> 00:46:09,822
We'll never get a warrant for this.

691
00:46:09,822 --> 00:46:10,922
Exactly.

692
00:46:11,123 --> 00:46:13,962
Since we can't get a warrant,
he's not even on the wanted list.

693
00:46:13,962 --> 00:46:15,192
Why stow away out of the country?

694
00:46:15,632 --> 00:46:19,003
Yu Jin Cheol doesn't have to leave
because he's not the suspect.

695
00:46:19,233 --> 00:46:21,302
No one but us knows
that he's connected...

696
00:46:21,503 --> 00:46:23,003
to Park Ye Young's murder.

697
00:46:24,242 --> 00:46:25,842
If he's not going to stow away...

698
00:46:29,572 --> 00:46:31,543
Text messages or records.
I don't care what it is.

699
00:46:31,683 --> 00:46:33,813
Prioritize anything
relevant to the airport.

700
00:46:34,512 --> 00:46:36,012
Hurry up. I'm getting anxious here.

701
00:46:36,313 --> 00:46:38,623
Gosh. I'm doing the best I can
to restore this phone.

702
00:46:38,623 --> 00:46:40,282
Just give me some time
to do my thing.

703
00:46:51,063 --> 00:46:52,063
I got it.

704
00:46:52,632 --> 00:46:53,802
Hey!

705
00:46:54,032 --> 00:46:56,402
My goodness.
It's a 10 p.m. flight to Shanghai.

706
00:47:05,043 --> 00:47:07,442
The flight to Shanghai
is boarding now.

707
00:47:10,212 --> 00:47:12,152
(9:42 p.m., Wednesday, September 14)

708
00:47:34,572 --> 00:47:35,873
- Your ticket is checked.
- Thank you.

709
00:47:41,583 --> 00:47:43,152
- Hello.
- Hello. Welcome.

710
00:47:43,152 --> 00:47:44,552
- You can go inside.
- Hello.

711
00:47:44,552 --> 00:47:47,453
- Hello. Please show your ticket.
- You can go this way.

712
00:47:47,583 --> 00:47:49,992
- Thank you.
- You should go in and turn right.

713
00:48:02,433 --> 00:48:03,603
Good job.

714
00:48:04,473 --> 00:48:06,003
It's a 10 p.m. flight to Shanghai.

715
00:48:06,273 --> 00:48:08,913
Check the boarding list
and check Yu Jin Cheol's location.

716
00:48:09,773 --> 00:48:11,742
He's a prime witness
to a murder case.

717
00:48:12,413 --> 00:48:15,183
Even if you tell us to do that,

718
00:48:15,183 --> 00:48:17,983
we have no right to stop the flight.

719
00:48:18,282 --> 00:48:20,853
It's not like he's under
the prohibition of departure.

720
00:48:21,552 --> 00:48:23,253
Sir, I'm Prosecutor Shin A Ra...

721
00:48:23,253 --> 00:48:24,322
from the Seoul Central District
Prosecutors' Office.

722
00:48:24,362 --> 00:48:27,063
We have a situation.
Can't you help us out this one time?

723
00:48:27,262 --> 00:48:29,132
Well, then...

724
00:48:29,592 --> 00:48:31,632
Send me the warrant via fax.

725
00:48:32,703 --> 00:48:34,103
We don't have time for that.

726
00:48:34,103 --> 00:48:35,603
I'm busy, so I'll hang up now.

727
00:48:35,603 --> 00:48:38,172
Wait, sir. Hey!

728
00:48:39,373 --> 00:48:41,342
(9:52 p.m., Wednesday, September 14)

729
00:48:41,342 --> 00:48:42,773
(9:53 p.m., Wednesday, September 14)

730
00:48:50,683 --> 00:48:53,753
Please put your luggage
in the overhead compartment.

731
00:48:53,753 --> 00:48:55,992
Would you please put the table back
in its place?

732
00:49:15,413 --> 00:49:17,782
(International Departures)

733
00:49:17,782 --> 00:49:19,942
(10:20 p.m., Shanghai)

734
00:49:23,453 --> 00:49:25,583
Did the flight to Shanghai
leaving at 10 p.m. take off?

735
00:49:29,253 --> 00:49:32,492
Please check Flight JZ1852.

736
00:49:40,802 --> 00:49:43,672
They said the plane was moving
to the runway now.

737
00:49:54,483 --> 00:49:55,652
Let's go back.

738
00:49:57,282 --> 00:49:58,623
It's over.

739
00:49:59,483 --> 00:50:01,623
It's not a taxi.
How are you going to stop a plane?

740
00:50:03,592 --> 00:50:05,322
He took off. It's over.

741
00:50:06,293 --> 00:50:07,422
Let's go.

742
00:50:09,333 --> 00:50:10,862
No, there's still a way.

743
00:50:14,233 --> 00:50:15,933
We'll do something crazy.

744

(Airport Information)

745
00:50:25,543 --> 00:50:28,612
Hello, this is the information desk.
How can help you?

746
00:50:29,413 --> 00:50:30,882
I put a bomb on a plane.

747
00:50:31,753 --> 00:50:32,882
Pardon?

748
00:50:33,183 --> 00:50:35,223
Can you repeat that?

749
00:50:35,393 --> 00:50:38,663
The flight to Shanghai
that leaves at 10 p.m.

750
00:50:38,723 --> 00:50:40,393
There's a bomb on that plane.

751
00:50:42,063 --> 00:50:43,893
Stop the plane.

752
00:50:44,092 --> 00:50:47,103
Or you'll see a pool of blood
at this airport.

753
00:50:47,833 --> 00:50:49,933
Hello?

754
00:50:50,902 --> 00:50:52,302
Call security.

755
00:50:53,143 --> 00:50:56,543
Goodness. What have you done?

756
00:50:56,543 --> 00:50:58,382
Why would you even ask?
I don't know either.

757
00:50:58,382 --> 00:50:59,483
Let's go.

758
00:51:03,753 --> 00:51:05,123
- Hey.
- What?

759
00:51:05,882 --> 00:51:08,152
Stop Flight JZ1852 this instant.

760
00:51:08,152 --> 00:51:09,652
Here's an announcement.

761

Our flight, JZ1852, is...

762
00:51:12,063 --> 00:51:13,123
going back to the airport...

763
00:51:13,123 --> 00:51:14,833
- due to security reasons.
- What?

764
00:51:14,833 --> 00:51:16,032
Please follow the instructions...

765
00:51:16,032 --> 00:51:17,192
- directed by the crew members...
- What's going on?

766
00:51:17,192 --> 00:51:19,462
- and stay seated for a moment.
- Excuse me.

Here's an announcement.

768
00:51:24,072 --> 00:51:26,203

for your cooperation.

- Please wait, sir.

Please follow our directions
and calmly evacuate the plane.

- My goodness.

- What if there really is...
- We need to know about it.

796
00:53:07,172 --> 00:53:08,342
a bomb on the plane?

My goodness.

- Is this really happening?
- Why aren't they coming?

799
00:53:13,112 --> 00:53:15,012
- What's going on? Tell us.
- So...

800
00:53:15,552 --> 00:53:17,813
they will come out this way, right?

801
00:53:17,853 --> 00:53:19,253
The passengers from the plane.

802
00:53:19,253 --> 00:53:21,253
They need some time
to look for the bomb.

Look at his face.

804
00:53:27,692 --> 00:53:30,393
He doesn't realize
what he just caused.

805
00:53:32,333 --> 00:53:33,962
He'll have a plan.

806

I think.

Otherwise, we're going down together.

809

He's over there.

Move!

- Goodness. Move.

Excuse me.

00:54:26,123 --> 00:54:28,592
- Excuse me.
- I'm sorry.

818
00:54:28,652 --> 00:54:29,793
Excuse me.

819
00:54:31,523 --> 00:54:32,523
Where is he?

820
00:54:47,842 --> 00:54:48,973
Yes, Prosecutor Jin.

821
00:54:49,043 --> 00:54:51,612
Yu Jin Cheol is gone. Find him.

822
00:54:51,813 --> 00:54:53,043
Yes, sir.

823
00:54:56,753 --> 00:54:58,083
Darn it.

824
00:54:59,123 --> 00:55:00,123
Stop!

825
00:55:00,353 --> 00:55:01,652
Darn it.

826
00:55:01,953 --> 00:55:03,092
Hey!

827
00:55:05,922 --> 00:55:06,962
What?

828
00:55:07,262 --> 00:55:09,163
- What's going on?
- Don't follow me.

829
00:55:12,632 --> 00:55:13,962
- Goodness.
- Hey!

830
00:55:13,962 --> 00:55:16,802
- My goodness.
- Are you okay?

831
00:55:23,543 --> 00:55:24,712
Darn it.

832
00:55:30,282 --> 00:55:31,382
Move!

833
00:55:42,992 --> 00:55:45,163
He's going down. Hurry!

834
00:55:47,563 --> 00:55:48,833
Yu Jin Cheol!

835
00:55:49,333 --> 00:55:50,873
- Who's that?
- Yu Jin Cheol!

836
00:55:50,873 --> 00:55:51,902
Who are you?

837
00:55:52,203 --> 00:55:54,072
Give me a break.

838
00:55:56,712 --> 00:55:58,282
Unbelievable.

839
00:56:00,813 --> 00:56:02,012
Come here.

840
00:56:02,453 --> 00:56:04,112
Don't come near me.

841
00:56:04,512 --> 00:56:06,282
Don't come any closer.

842
00:56:07,382 --> 00:56:08,453
Hey.

843
00:56:09,322 --> 00:56:11,192
It's not going to change anything.
It's over now.

844
00:56:11,192 --> 00:56:13,393
I'm not joking.
I'll really kill her.

845
00:56:13,393 --> 00:56:15,762
I'll kill her!
Don't come any closer.

846
00:56:15,762 --> 00:56:17,293
You'll be in trouble
if you keep doing this.

847
00:56:17,293 --> 00:56:19,833
Don't come near me.

848
00:56:20,833 --> 00:56:23,473
He's really mad right now.

849
00:56:35,813 --> 00:56:37,413
You don't want to get caught
that easily, right?

850
00:56:38,253 --> 00:56:39,552
Let's have one round then.

851
00:56:40,052 --> 00:56:42,422
All right. You're dead.

852
00:56:44,353 --> 00:56:45,462
You punk...

853
00:57:01,072 --> 00:57:02,072
Why you...

854
00:57:02,543 --> 00:57:04,072
Get over here.

855
00:57:04,882 --> 00:57:05,882
Take that.

856
00:57:30,333 --> 00:57:31,333
This way.

857
00:57:33,143 --> 00:57:34,203

860
00:57:39,983 --> 00:57:41,612
You have impeccable timing.

861
00:57:41,612 --> 00:57:43,382
I'm afraid you'll have
to come with us.

862
00:57:43,583 --> 00:57:45,652
What on earth is going on?

863
00:57:45,983 --> 00:57:47,023
Handle him.

864
00:57:47,422 --> 00:57:49,293
No, you have the wrong guy.

865
00:57:49,492 --> 00:57:51,023
What are they doing?

866
00:57:52,623 --> 00:57:54,523
- This is the guy.
- Come on.

867
00:57:54,822 --> 00:57:56,192
- Wasn't it him?
- No way.

Where's Yu Jin Cheol?

870
00:58:02,172 --> 00:58:03,532
He disappeared from the airport.

871
00:58:06,473 --> 00:58:07,773
And Prosecutor Jin?

872
00:58:08,172 --> 00:58:09,172
Get the door.

873
00:58:12,083 --> 00:58:13,712
He is being held by airport security.

874
00:58:13,842 --> 00:58:15,112
That crazy brat.

875
00:58:15,953 --> 00:58:17,652
And he calls himself a prosecutor?

876
00:58:19,282 --> 00:58:22,393
I'll get hold of Yu Jin Cheol
as soon as possible.

877
00:58:23,953 --> 00:58:25,123
You do that.

878

879
00:58:27,023 --> 00:58:28,893
make sure that tomorrow's
inauguration ceremony...

880

goes smoothly.

My family at the prosecutors' office,

901
01:00:08,123 --> 01:00:09,362
I stand before you today...

01:00:09,862 --> 01:00:11,132

From here on out, we...

906
01:00:24,543 --> 01:00:25,813
We, the prosecution,

907
01:00:26,882 --> 01:00:28,712
will be trusted by the people.

908
01:00:28,983 --> 01:00:30,353
Rather than giving in to power,

909
01:00:30,753 --> 01:00:32,382
we will fight against it if we must.

910

- What was that about?
- What's going on?

914

I got the cramps
from being crammed in that space.

Can you stay right there?

916

- Why that...
- Mic check.

917
01:00:56,612 --> 01:01:00,043
Hello, reporters
and fellow prosecutors.

918
01:01:00,742 --> 01:01:01,782
I'm Jin Jung.

919
01:01:04,152 --> 01:01:05,723
I address you here
at the ceremony...

920
01:01:06,223 --> 01:01:07,422
to tell you...

921
01:01:08,253 --> 01:01:11,192
that the prosecutors' office
is more rotten...

922
01:01:11,192 --> 01:01:12,623
than you believe it to be.

923
01:01:12,623 --> 01:01:14,492
- What?
- What is he saying?

924
01:01:14,692 --> 01:01:16,262
- Are you out of your mind?
- Come on.

925
01:01:18,603 --> 01:01:20,132
Evidence that'd prove
a man's innocence was destroyed,

926
01:01:20,362 --> 01:01:21,703
cases were fabricated,

927
01:01:22,132 --> 01:01:23,703
and then they were closed.

928
01:01:25,643 --> 01:01:27,143
What I stated didn't happen elsewhere.

929
01:01:29,643 --> 01:01:30,643
Right here.

930
01:01:31,373 --> 01:01:33,882
It was done at this office known as...

931
01:01:34,012 --> 01:01:35,652
the nation's top
law enforcement agency.

932
01:01:36,052 --> 01:01:38,183
- What?
- Is that true?

933
01:01:38,922 --> 01:01:40,353
Now, watch what happens next.

934
01:01:48,063 --> 01:01:49,563
What do you think you're doing?

935
01:01:50,492 --> 01:01:52,802
I'll show you what I'm getting at.

936
01:01:54,163 --> 01:01:57,072
Lee Jang Won,
you are under arrest...

937
01:01:57,072 --> 01:01:59,143
as the prime suspect
in the Seocho-dong murder case.

938
01:01:59,273 --> 01:02:01,203
- What?
- What on earth?

939
01:02:01,203 --> 01:02:03,712
- What did he just say?
- No way!

940
01:02:03,712 --> 01:02:05,983
- Are you kidding me?
- What is he doing?

941
01:02:05,983 --> 01:02:07,612
- Can you believe it?
- Is he insane?

942
01:02:07,612 --> 01:02:10,212
Congratulations
on your life being over.

I heard Prosecutor Kim
pulled strings for me.

948
01:02:48,592 --> 01:02:51,123
It was to get rid of the cancer
poisoning this office.

949

Get rid of Prosecutor Jin.

950

- Drop your weapon.
- Yu Jin Cheol's gone.

951
01:02:55,333 --> 01:02:57,532
I had no choice
but to give a false statement.

952

We're going after
Deputy Chief Lee's flash drive.

953

If things go south,

954
01:03:01,063 --> 01:03:02,132
we'll be sentenced to
at least five years in prison.

955
01:03:02,132 --> 01:03:03,632
What's life without a little risk?

956

Let's go and get the bad guy.

957
01:03:05,273 --> 01:03:08,203
Only a nutcase would think to steal
from the deputy chief's office.

958
01:03:08,203 --> 01:03:09,212
The world's dirty enough,

959
01:03:09,212 --> 01:03:10,643
and it needs
at least one person like me.
