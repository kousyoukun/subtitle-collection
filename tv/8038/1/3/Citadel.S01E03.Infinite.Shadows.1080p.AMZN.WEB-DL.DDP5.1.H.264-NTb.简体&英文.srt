Couldn't tell you. We weren't that close.

纯粹是工作关系 从来没有私人交情

-快说啊 兄弟 -不行

121
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:21,620
我就是预先通报了一下 仅此而已
It was just a pre-briefing, that's all, nothing.

122
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:22,830

an advanced research facility in the Alborz Mountains.

125
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:31,330
厄尔布尔士山脉 为什么就不能是 阿卡普尔科 伯利兹或伊比萨岛呢
Alborz Mountains. Why is it never Acapulco? Or Belize, or Ibiza?

126
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:33,040
她还没说上几句话呢
Come on. She's barely two seconds in

127
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,950
你就像斯塔特勒 和沃尔多夫一样质问她
and you're heckling her like Statler and Waldorf.

128
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:43,080
你们知道吧  就是《大青蛙布偶秀》里那俩老布偶
You know, the Muppets? The two old Muppets?

129
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,950

Our newest Tier-One will be on-site. They've been working

133
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,200
把病毒放在了便于我们取回的位置
as a mole with Hasan and planted the virus for easy retrieval.

134
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,000
难点不在于怎么进去 而在于怎么出来
The hard part isn't getting in, it's getting out.

135
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,700
要塞有重兵把守 此外还有监控和导弹系统

139
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:12,620
-我怎么认出他们  -到时候自然就知道了
- How will I know them? - Oh, you'll know.

通讯已恢复
Comms reconnected.

158
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,120
敌人的全地形车正在快速逼近 你被包围了
Enemy ATVs fast approaching. They've got you surrounded.

159
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,870
那可未必
- Not quite.

160
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:44,910
不要 你他妈要干吗
- Mason, no, no, no! What the hell are you doing?

161
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:45,950
搭个车
Catching a ride!

162
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:06,370
动作快点 梅森 敌人从空中来了
Look alive, Mason. We got hostiles in the air.

163
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:09,910
启动滑雪靴
Activate ski-boots.

164
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:14,620

Merry Christmas, Alpha.

168
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:06,250
雪量快用光了
Heads up, the snow line is ending.

169
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:08,580
重复 你的雪量快耗尽了
I repeat, you are running out of snow.

170
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:17,290

我会坚持完成任务的
I'm pushing through it.

173
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:29,620
(波斯语) 住手
Stop!

174
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:38,250
就是她 她就是我们的新特工
That's her. That's our new agent.

175
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:52,250
我没子弹了
I'm out!

176
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,040
左肺充血
That left lung is filling up with blood,

177
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,000
氧气含量不足 而且你脑震荡了
oxygen levels running low. And you're also concussed.

178
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:09,450
就是这些情况
So, there's that.

179
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:11,120
给我枪
Gun!

180
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,540
他内出血了 血压在下降
He's hemostatic. Blood pressure's dropping.

前往向南三公里位于空地上的撤离点
Gemini, head to the extraction point three klicks south, in the clearing.

收到 正在前往 我们走
Copy. En route. Come on.

坚持住
Hang on.

184
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:43,620
你...
You...

185
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:45,370
保持清醒 好吗
Stay with me, okay?

186
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:46,500
好吗
Yeah?

187
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:04,540
我不方便
I'm busy.

188
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:07,830
抱歉 我不想打扰你 但我就是觉得应该自我介绍一下
Sorry, I don't want to disturb you, I just thought I'd introduce myself.

189
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:09,910
纳迪亚辛赫
Nadia Sinh.

190
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:11,870
梅森凯恩
Mason Kane.

191
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:13,660
不客气 梅森凯恩
You're welcome, Mason Kane.

192
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:15,500
你说什么
Excuse me?

193
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,790
你差点就把整个任务搅黄了
Well, you almost blew the entire mission.

194
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:19,830
差点就让美国的一半人口感染病毒了
Half of the U.S. would be infected by now.

195
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:22,160
-当时的局面尽在我掌控之中 -是吗
- I had it covered. - Did you, though?

196
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:25,910
小菜鸟 我是那种人
That's the thing about me, Rookie.

197
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:28,700
当你觉得我已经没有胜算的时候 我就会扭转乾坤
Just when you think I'm down and out, I'll turn it around.

198
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:29,830
好吧
Right, right, right.

199
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:32,790
对了 有句话我们必须说清楚
Also, just so we're very fucking clear,

200
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:33,910
我不是菜鸟
not a rookie.

201
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,540
你是哪来的 军情六处
Where'd you come from? MI6?

202
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:38,540
-印度情报局  -我可是土生土长的
- IB? - I'm homegrown.

203
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:40,750
我母亲是堡垒的特工 我五年前加入了堡垒
My mother was Citadel, I joined five years ago.

204
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,160
来自精英小队
Came up through Bravo Team.

205
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,950
精英小队 不错 了不起
Bravo Team. That's cute. That's adorable.

206
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:46,750
你知道最了不起的是什么吗
You know what's adorable?

207
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:50,910
你的上级求着我加入一级行动员 好让我救你狗命
Is your director begging me to join Tier-One just in time to save your ass.

208
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:53,080
这就是我魅力的一部分
That... is part of my charm.

209
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:56,200
有个当间谍的妈 从小到大肯定很不容易吧
Must've been hard growing up with a spy for a mother.

210
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,660
连个妈都没有 从小到大肯定很不容易吧
Must've been hard growing up with no mother at all.

211
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:02,620
抱歉
Sorry.

212
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,370
你看了我的资料
You read my file.

213
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:06,620
没想到你还是我的粉丝呢
Didn't pin you for a fan.

214
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:14,660
我一般不这么做 但我可以给你签名
You know, I don't usually do this, but I could sign an autograph.

215
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:16,700
跟你自拍
Take a selfie?

216
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:21,370
小心我干你
Fuck you.

217
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:23,700
那也尽在我掌控之中
I would've had it covered.

218
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:49,330
巴黎 两周后

219
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:52,410
我能信任你吗
Can I trust you?

220
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,080
当然了
Of course.

221
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,160
我能信任你吗
Can I trust you?

222
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:02,620
永远可以信任我
Always.

223
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:13,330
堡垒安全屋 十年后

224
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:23,120
私人模式已启动
Private mode initiated.

225
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,370
登录中...

226
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,580
发送安全信息

227
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:42,910
天气怎么样

228
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:52,160
基本上是晴天

229
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:03,290
真的是你吗

230
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:12,580
是的

231
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:20,250
货物怎么样了

232
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:21,830
在等你

233
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:45,910
瓦伦西亚可能暴露了

234
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:48,160
准备好应急措施 我很快就到

235
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:16,450
见到你我真开心 伯纳德
Nice to see you, Bernard.

236
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:20,450
见到你是真他妈糟糕 黛丽娅
It's horrifically fucking terrible to see you, Dahlia.

237
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:23,000
糟糕透顶
Couldn't be worse.

238
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:27,500
我想你看到我坐在桌子的这一头 很震惊吧
I imagine it's a shock to see me at this end of the table.

239
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:31,040
这倒是 我原以为你会在吸血
Yeah. I thought you might be at a blood-feed,

240
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:35,250
或者搞动物献祭 或者在忙你每周的女巫集会呢
or an animal sacrifice or your weekly coven meeting.

241
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:39,410
虽然多年前我们曾一起在联合国工作
Even when we were together all those years ago at the U.N.,

242
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:43,120
但你总是有那种 不可描述的反社会的特质
you always had that sociopathic je ne sais quois about you.

243
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:45,620
给他看看
Show him.

244
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:50,410
在我们拿到X箱子之前 只能用手头掌握的一些堡垒技术了
Until we get the X Case, we'll have to make do with what we've got.

245
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:53,160
我们尽全力抢救了 还没来得及被你的间谍破坏的
We made sure to salvage every piece of Citadel tech

246
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,370
每一项堡垒的技术
that wasn't sabotaged by your spies.

247
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:59,200
这其中最好用的 当属堡垒人工智能系统
Among the delights was a Citadel A.I. system

248
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,200
它能追踪世界各地的铀含量
that tracked uranium levels throughout the world.

249
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:07,790
还能随时追踪 全世界所有核武器的下落
The whereabouts, at any time, of all nuclear weapons.

250
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:11,830
唯一的问题是 我们无法进入系统 我们已经试了很多年
Only, we can't access the system. We've tried for years.

251
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:15,830
但仿佛天降恩赐一般 你作为系统的创始人
But here before me, like a gift from God,

252
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:20,370
就坐在我的面前
sits the man who created it.

253
00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:21,950
所以 伯纳德
So, Bernard,

254
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:27,200
你要告诉我 进入系统所需要的19位数的密码
you need to tell me the 19-character password to access the system.

255
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:35,410
好吧
Okay. Okay.

256
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:43,870
密码是...
The password is...

257
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:47,830
"你
"Why...

258
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,330
"为什么
...don't...you...

259
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:57,040
"不趁早滚蛋呢 "
...fuck off."

260
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,080
不对 这只有18个字符
Oh, no, wait, that's only 18.

261
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,370
抱歉 要19个字符
I'm sorry, it's 19.

262
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:05,580
还有个感叹号 抱歉
There's an exclamation mark. Forgive me.

263
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:08,330
"你为什么不趁早滚蛋呢 感叹号"
"Why don't you fuck off, exclamation mark."

264
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,000
试试
Go ahead.

265
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:14,700
你真觉得为了阻止你 我做不到置生死于度外吗
Do you really think that I wouldn't give my life to stop you?

266
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:17,500
也许你能做到吧 但你老婆和女儿的命呢
Maybe, but what about the lives of your wife and daughter?

267
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:20,660
-她们在怀俄明州 对吧  -我完全不知道你在说什么
They're in Wyoming, right? I have no idea what you're talking about.

268
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:23,580
她们跟梅森凯恩的妻子和女儿在一起
With Mason Kane's wife and daughter,

269
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:24,660
不是吗
no?

270
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,500
这把刀是我妈给我的第一把
That knife is the first one my mom gave me.

271
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:47,950
如果按下这个按钮
If you push the thumb button,

272
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:49,580
刀片就会弹出来
blade just flicks out.

273
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,040
太帅了
Cool.

274
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,910
你想要的话就给你了
You can have it if you want.

275
00:21:58,290 --> 00:21:59,950
我给你演示一下怎么用
I'll show you how to use it.

276
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:10,080
嘿
Hey.

277
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:11,830
嘿
Hey.

278
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,790
你跟你老公是怎么认识的
So, how did you and your husband meet?

279
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:24,080
大概九年前 我出了一场严重的车祸
Uh, well, I was, um... I was in a bad car accident about nine years ago.

280
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,080
太不幸了
That's awful.

281
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:28,120
我不记得了 创伤性脑损伤
I don't remember it. Traumatic brain injury.

282
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:32,540
总之 我们家附近有一家很棒的医院
Anyway, um, there was a great hospital nearby.

283
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:36,500
我在那里开始接受记忆疗法 当时凯尔也在...
And I started memory therapy there. And, um, Kyle was just...

284
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:40,540
他也参加了同样的项目
He was in the same program.

285
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:44,500
我俩就这样认识了
That's how we met.

286
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,580
这故事真精彩
Quite a story.

287
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:55,250
她们不在怀俄明州 我都不知道她们在哪里
They're not in Wyoming. I don't even know where they are.

288
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:57,290
别装了 我们到处都有眼线
Oh, come on, Bernard, we have eyes everywhere.

289
00:22:57,290 --> 00:23:00,750
我们能访问所有安防探头和卫星
Access to every security camera, every satellite on the grid.

290
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:04,790
你开车去了我们的纽约总部 所以我们顺着你的轨迹倒查
You drove your truck to our New York headquarters, so we worked backwards, used every camera

291
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:08,950
用每个探头拼凑出了你去时的路线
at our disposal to piece your journey back to where you came from.

292
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:13,620
追溯到夏延郊外就查不到你的车了 所以 找到你妻子乔
We lost image of your truck just outside Cheyenne. So it's only a matter of time

293
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:16,830
以及你女儿瓦尔 只是时间早晚的问题
before we find your wife Joe and your daughter Val.

294
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:18,620
顺便一提 她是我前妻
She's my ex-wife, by the way.

295
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,660
而且我早告诉过你了...
And I told you already.

296
00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:22,540
趁早滚蛋
Fuck off.

297
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:28,080
一个世纪以来 你们都认为自己是在创造新秩序
For a century, you lot thought you were creating a new order.

298
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,160
但间谍不可能是圣人
But spies cannot be saints.

299
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:34,750
你们的行为准则 非但没能让你们变得更好
And your code isn't one that bettered you, but blinded you...

300
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:38,200
反而让你们 对堡垒带来的恐怖熟视无睹
to the horrors Citadel imparted.

301
00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:40,330
你错了
You're wrong.

302
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,120
是吗
Am I?

303
00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:49,830
你的同事以前也是这样的想法
Your colleague thought the same.

304
00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:55,620
但去年我们抓到他之后 就给他看了真相
But after we caught him last year, we pulled the wool from over his eyes.

305
00:23:57,410 --> 00:23:58,450
卡特斯宾塞
Carter Spence.

306
00:23:58,450 --> 00:24:02,000
-卡特  -没错 他最开始
- Carter? - Yes. He was quite uncooperative...

307
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,330
极为不配合
to begin with.

308
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:07,200
拼了命硬撑着
Held out for as long as he could.

309
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:09,410
-他在哪  -卡沃医生
- Where is he? - Dr. Carvo?

310
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:18,450
你把卡特怎么样了
What did you do to Carter?

311
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:43,250
你这么爱说话的人 怎么变得这么安静啊 伯纳德
For a man who loves to talk, you've gone awfully quiet, Bernard.

312
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:46,620
好吧...
Well...

313
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,700
我在学着多一些倾听
I'm learning to listen more.

314
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:54,580
我们还有一种方法
There is another way we could do this.

315
00:24:56,330 --> 00:24:57,830
我们可以
We could...

316
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:00,660
直接
...cut right

317
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:03,660
切入你的脑干
into your brain stem.

318
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,790
提取你的记忆
Excavate your memories.

319
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:11,910
这是安德斯希尔杰发明的一个 很好用的小装置
It's a handy little device Anders Silje created.

320
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:15,410
先生们
Gentlemen.

321
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:23,620
你准备好玩玩新玩具了吗
You ready to play with your new toy?

322
00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:25,620
是的 夫人
Yes, ma'am.

323
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:28,000
别搞砸了
Don't fuck it up.

324
00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:31,910
你是哪一位来着
Which one are you, again?

325
00:25:33,290 --> 00:25:35,080
玛丽凯特还是阿什莉
Mary-Kate or Ashley?

326
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,450
梅森凯恩是你朋友 对吧
Mason Kane is a friend of yours, right?

327
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:41,660
我可不会把他算作朋友
I wouldn't say he's a friend. I mean,

328
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:44,580
他可能会说我俩是朋友
he'd probably say we're friends.

329
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:47,000
他可能会说我是他最好的朋友
Probably he'd say I'm his best friend, but...

330
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:50,540
但他的朋友并不多 很可悲
he doesn't have many friends. It's very sad.

331
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:53,450
我以前在工作中有很多朋友
I had a lot of friends at work.

332
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:55,950
卡尔P 安德里亚
Carl P. and Andrea.

333
00:25:56,450 --> 00:25:57,830
还有卡尔H
And Carl H.

334
00:25:58,790 --> 00:25:59,700
还有吉姆
And Jim.

335
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,410
但他们都已经不在了
But they're not around anymore.

336
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:05,830
奥立克先生 我研究过你的所有杰作
I've studied all your work, Mr. Orlick.

337
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:09,370
不得不说 我是你的忠实粉丝
And I have to admit that I'm a big fan.

338
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:13,000
人们常说:"千万别见自己的偶像"
They say never meet your heroes,

339
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:16,540
但我很欣慰见到了你 知道为什么吗
but I'm so glad I am. You know why?

340
00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:19,540
因为对凯恩的朋友
'Cause it gives me great pleasure

341
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:21,620
进行这样的操作
to do this...

342
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:26,620
能给我带来极大的快感
...to a friend of Kane's.

343
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:33,200
无论用什么方式 我都会拿到我想要的
Now I'm going to get what I want no matter what.

344
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:37,910
我们就盼着 我别破坏掉伯纳德奥立克的
Let's just hope we don't destroy the brilliant mind

345
00:26:39,410 --> 00:26:40,540
聪明才智吧
of Bernard Orlick.

346
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:43,540
布瑞尔还活着
Brielle is still alive.

347
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:45,870
什么 你刚才说什么
- What... - What did you just say?

348
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:47,910
我说:"布瑞尔还活着"
I said, Brielle is still alive.

349
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:51,830
你爱的女人是叫布瑞尔吧 不是吗
The woman you loved. That's her name, isn't it? Brielle?

350
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,660
堡垒骗了你
Citadel lied to you.

351
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,910
如果你这又是在耍花样
If this is another trick,

352
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:06,250
我就把你大卸八块
I'm gonna tear you apart.

353
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:07,870
听明白了吗
You understand?

354
00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:08,870
我发誓
I swear.

355
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,700
那你最好证明给我看
Well, you better prove it then.

356
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:13,950
把我的手机拿来
Bring me my phone...

357
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:16,660
我给你看
and I'll show you.

358
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:23,080
你俩还好吗
How you two doing?

359
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:25,080
你知道的...
Oh, you know.

360
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:30,620
除了我不让亨德里克斯在地堡里 刷短视频 导致她情绪有点崩溃之外
Other than Hendrix having a meltdown because I won't let her TikTok from the bunker...

361
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:32,830
我们挺好的
...we're fine.

362
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:37,700
那个堡垒的间谍 我找到她了
Well, I found her... the, uh, Citadel spy.

363
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,580
她什么都记得
She remembers everything.

364
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:40,580
是女的
She?

365
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:41,660
是的
Yeah.

366
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:44,450
她叫纳迪亚
Her name's Nadia.

367
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:48,330
那是好事啊
I mean, that's-that's great.

368
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:51,870
她是怎么说梅森的 她还知道什么
What-what did she say about Mason? What else did she know?

369
00:27:53,910 --> 00:27:54,910
她知道的并不多
Not a lot.

370
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,540
你们俩以前认识吗
Did you two not know each other?

371
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,370
好像不太认识
I don't think well.

372
00:28:10,290 --> 00:28:13,250
我们会把事情搞定 然后我就回你身边
We're gonna figure this out and then I'm coming back to you, okay?

373
00:28:14,370 --> 00:28:15,290
好的
Yeah.

374
00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:18,750
搞定之后就回来
Figure it out and come back.

375
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:19,910
我会的
I will.

376
00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:21,830
尽可能多打电话联系我们
Call as much as you can.

377
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:22,870
我会的
I will.

378
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:26,450
我爱你 凯尔
I love you, Kyle.

379
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,250
我也爱你
I love you, too.

380
00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:45,410
你开车去巴拉哈斯机场吧
Drive yourself to Barajas airport.

381

我要留下来陪你
I'm staying with you.

383
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,700
他们看到我们了 知道我们还活着 他们杀了伯纳德
They saw us. They know we're alive. They killed Bernard.

384
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:03,700
他们会来追杀我们
They're gonna come after us with everything they've got.

385
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,870
你应该回去保护好家人
You need to go home and protect your family.

386
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:07,580
如果我真回去了 他们会找到我
If I go home, they're gonna find me.

387
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:09,450
只有阻止他们 我才能保护家人
Stopping them, that's how I protect my family.

388
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:11,830
-你对我来说毫无用处 -伯纳德可不是这么认为的
- You're of no use to me. - Bernard didn't think so.

389
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:13,870
伯纳德很蠢 而你就是个累赘
Bernard was a fool. And you're a liability.

390
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:14,790
教教我
Teach me.

391
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:16,120
-教什么  -教我当梅森凯恩
- What? - To be Mason Kane.

392
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,910
-你在说什么  -训练我
- What are you talking about? - Train me.

393
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:19,870
-我会边学边干 -你不是他
- I'll learn on the go. - You're not him.

394
00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:21,370
-我可以是他 -你不会想变成他
- I can be. - You don't want to be him.

395
00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:23,950
没有别人了 只剩下咱俩了
Well, there's no one else. It's just you and me.

396
00:29:24,410 --> 00:29:26,910
一片红色的海洋里 只有两个闪烁的白点
Two flashing white lights in a sea of red.

397
00:29:38,330 --> 00:29:39,450
什么红色的海洋
What sea of red?

398
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:43,830
闪烁的灯是求救信号 搜索信件
Flashing lights are an SOS. "Search Missives."

399
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,870
这些都是求救的信息
These are all messages. Calls for help.

417
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:40,200
距菲斯几公里之外
He's a few miles outside of Fez.

418
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:41,910
这是个暗点
It's a black site.

419
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:43,660
你怎么知道的
How do you know?

420
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:47,250
我在青年党当卧底的时候 曾在那里受了两周的酷刑
'Cause I was tortured there for two weeks when I was undercover with al-Shahaab.

421
00:30:48,290 --> 00:30:51,830
这个暗点的老大是一个叫 鲍德温巴斯托的葡萄牙黑帮老大
This black site's run by a Portuguese crime boss named Balduino Basto.

422
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:54,500
我敢肯定这个暗点为曼提柯尔所用了
I bet Manticore's using it.

423
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:58,540
通过折磨卡特 以获取X箱子的位置
Torturing Carter to get the location of the X Case.

424
00:30:58,540 --> 00:30:59,830
我得把他救出来
I got to get him out.

425
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:01,500
-怎么救  -鲍德温
- How? - Balduino.

426
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:06,410
我只需要离他足够近 就能黑进他的手机 窃取访问代码
I just have to get close enough to hack his phone to steal his access codes.

427
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,120
问题是 他对我没有好意
Problem is he's not a fan of yours truly.

428
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,370
为什么
And why is that?

429
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:13,200
-我可能杀了他的哥哥 -"可能杀了"
I might have killed his brother. Might have?

430
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,700
我不能跟鲍德温见面
I can't get a sit-down with Balduino.

431
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:23,950
但他跟凯恩关系友好
But him and Kane, they were tight.

432
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,950
所以你的意思是...
So what you're saying is...

433
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,830
你准备好当梅森凯恩了吗
Are you ready to be Mason Kane?

434
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:38,700
摩洛哥

435
00:31:44,450 --> 00:31:48,120
记住我跟你说的 你要以诚恳的态度接近鲍德温
Remember what I told you. Approach Balduino with your palms up.

436
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:51,370
表明你不是个威胁 这样一来你应该就安全了
Establish you're not a threat and you should be straight.

437
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:06,450
我餐厅里居然来了个死人
There's a dead man in my restaurant.

438
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,540
好久不见啊
It's been a long time.

439
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:10,540
打火机里有个接收器
There's a transmitter in that lighter.

440
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:14,370
在我从他手机里下载数据时 你尽可能把打火机放近一点
Keep it as close as possible while I download the data from his phone.

441
00:32:14,370 --> 00:32:16,620
我以为八年前他们把你杀了
I thought they killed you eight years ago.

442
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:17,790
别坐立不安了
Stop fidgeting.

443
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:19,950
你是梅森凯恩 镇定点
You're Mason Kane. Own it.

444
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:23,410
然而这么久了 你却连一根头发丝儿都没长出来
And yet in all this time you haven't bothered to grow one single hair.

445
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:25,830
你这次来想干什么
So, what do you want?

446
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:29,830
你假意求他帮大忙 他肯定会很嘚瑟
Needs to be a big ask. It'll stroke his ego.

447
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:33,250
我需要你帮忙 把我弄进武装部队总司令的办公室
I need your help to get into the office of the Chief of the Armed Forces.

448
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:38,080
那是鲍德温的孩子
That's Baldy's kid.

449
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,000
他说让你去死
He just told you to go fuck yourself.

450
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,660
就没有个儿童球池 能让你家孩子去玩吗
Isn't there a ball pit somewhere your kid can go play in?

451
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:44,290
武装部队总司令
The Chief of Armed Forces?

452
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,660
你还不如直接让我
You might as well have asked me how to get

453
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:48,870
把你送到剑桥公爵夫人的两腿之间呢
between the legs of the Duchess of Cambridge.

454
00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:51,370
我会帮你摆脱曼提柯尔
I'll get Manticore's heel off your neck.

455
00:32:51,370 --> 00:32:53,540
现在江湖上是曼提柯尔一家独大
Manticore is the only game in town now.

456
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:56,330
我敢说 我要把你交给他们 肯定能大赚一笔
And I bet I could make a fortune if I hand you over to them.

457
00:32:56,330 --> 00:32:59,200
找武器 你可能得杀出一条血路
Look for a weapon. You may have to shoot your way out.

458
00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:02,620
我记忆中的鲍德温巴斯托
The Balduino Basto I remember would've wanted

459
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:06,000
可远远不会满足于 向曼提柯尔卑躬屈膝 撅腰瓦腚
something more than just to bend over for Manticore.

这是你女朋友给你的那个打火机吗
Is that the lighter your girlfriend gave you?

462
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:14,750
纳迪亚
Nadia?

463
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:20,620
我听说她跟你一起出现在了意大利
I heard she was with you in Italy.

464
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,160
她怎么了
What happened to her?

465
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,200
她死了
She's gone.

466
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:34,330
那你为什么还要战斗 是为了她吗
So, why do you still fight? For her?

467
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:35,830
为了她的回忆
Her memory?

凯恩 我很惊讶 你居然会爱上一个
I'm surprised, Kane, that you, of all people would carry a torch

470
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:46,500
曾经出卖过你 并且把堡垒摧毁的女人
for the woman who sold you out. Who brought Citadel to its knees.

数据传输完成 赶快出来
Transfer's complete. Get out of there.

472

你到底在说什么
The hell are you talking about?

473
00:33:49,910 --> 00:33:52,200
堡垒内部有曼提柯尔的人
Manticore had somebody working on the inside.

474
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,200
也就是你的女友 纳迪亚
It was your girl Nadia.

475
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:58,000
反正起码大家都是这么传的
Or at least, that is what the whispers say.

476
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,700
那个贱女人死得活该
That bitch deserved to die.

477
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:01,950
凯尔 赶快出来
Kyle, you got to go now.

478
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:03,200
不是吧
Oh, shit.

479
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:06,000
你居然被个妞儿耍了
You got played by a piece of ass.

480
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,040
我还以为梅森凯恩是个真男人呢
I thought Mason Kane was supposed to be a real man.

481
00:34:12,870 --> 00:34:15,790
我还以为 你爸跟妓女睡的时候戴了套呢
I thought your dad wore condoms when he slept with whores.

482
00:34:17,290 --> 00:34:18,120
凯尔
Kyle!

483
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:30,040
你这是急着送死
You are in a very big hurry to die.

484
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:32,700
今天不行 我要走出这里
Not today. I'm walking out of here.

485
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:33,910
把枪对准克里斯蒂亚诺
Point it at Christiano.

486
00:34:33,910 --> 00:34:36,540
鲍德温根本不在乎你开枪杀了他 但如果杀了他孩子...
Balduino won't give a shit if you shot him, but his kid...

487
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,910
杀了他 你还在等什么
Kill him. What are you waiting for?

488
00:34:39,910 --> 00:34:41,370
让他们把枪放下
Tell them to lower their guns.

489
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,120
你先放下
You first.

490
00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:48,750
杀了他
Shoot him.

491
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:20,500
这他妈是什么情况
What the fuck's going on here?

492
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,870
他刚才说的是什么
What was he talking about?

493
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:25,950
纯粹胡扯 他就是个骗子
Horseshit. He's a liar.

494
00:35:29,290 --> 00:35:31,290
伯纳德说过 堡垒的沦陷是内部出了叛徒
Bernard said the Citadel hit was an inside job.

495
00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:33,500
有人叛变了 但他不知道那个人是谁
That someone turned but he didn't know who.

496
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:35,500
是你吗
Was it you?

497
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:38,870
你想想 凯尔
Think about it, Kyle.

498
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:41,080
如果我在跟曼提柯尔合作
If I was working with Manticore,

499
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:43,910
那我为什么要闯入暗点 营救堡垒的特工呢
why would I be trying to break into a black site to free a Citadel agent,

500
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:46,370
而且我为什么要救你命呢
and why the fuck are you still alive?

501
00:35:47,330 --> 00:35:49,540
他跟我聊起你的时候 你一个劲儿地让我出来
You tried to pull me out when he started talking about you...

502
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:50,790
那是因为我不想让你送死
Because I didn't want you to get killed.

503
00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:53,370
你为什么不告诉我 你跟梅森曾经是一对儿
And why not just tell me you and Mason were a thing?

504
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:01,450
因为梅森和我之间的事情 只是他跟我之间的事情
Because what happened between me and Mason is between me and Mason.

505
00:36:03,290 --> 00:36:04,750
你现在坐在撤离的车里
You're in a getaway car

506
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:07,790
全世界所有的曼提柯尔特工都在找你
with every Manticore agent in the world looking for you.

507
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:11,540
所以 你要么跟我合作
So, you can either do this with me

508
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,450
要么就滚下车
or get the fuck out.

509
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,830
建议你打字的时候慎重一点
I'd be very careful what I type.

510
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:39,950
这是布瑞尔 对吧
That's Brielle, right?

511
00:36:43,370 --> 00:36:44,330
不会吧
No.

512
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:51,660
她还活着
She's alive.

513
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,410
她叫艾比
Her name is Abby.

514
00:36:55,290 --> 00:36:56,950
她嫁给了梅森凯恩
And she's married to Mason Kane.

515
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,410
我可以带你去见她
I can take you to her.

516
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:17,700
如果你把我从这里救出去 我就把一切都告诉你
If you get me out of here, I'll tell you everything...

517
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:23,660
因为你所知道的一切都是谎言
...because everything you know is a lie.

518
00:37:24,290 --> 00:37:26,370
? I was told a million times ?

519
00:37:26,370 --> 00:37:28,160
? Of all the troubles in my way ?

520
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,120
? Mind you grow a little wiser ?

521
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:32,750
? Little better every day ?

522
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:34,950
这是我们的新一级行动员吗
This our new Tier-One?

523
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:36,620
她跟我说 我会爱你的
She told me I'm gonna love you.

524
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:37,580
你不会的
You won't.

525

《堡垒》下集精彩看点

526
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:41,910
要想让他们相信你的谎言
The only way they're gonna believe your lie

527
00:37:42,330 --> 00:37:43,540
首先你自己要信
is if you do.

528
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:48,040
塞莱斯特已经失联三个月了
Celeste has been dark for three months.

529
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:50,200
你也知道打入内部是什么样的
You know what it's like on the inside.

530
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:52,540
她跟我能力一样强
She's just as capable as I am.

531
00:37:53,330 --> 00:37:55,000
这正是我所担心的
That's what I'm worried about.

532
00:37:57,250 --> 00:37:59,040
你当初就不应该让我加入
You never should have brought me on.
