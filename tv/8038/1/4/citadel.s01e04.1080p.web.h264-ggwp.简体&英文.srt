78
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:05,600
你这算是什么问题
What kind of question is that?

79
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,830
真诚的问题
An honest one.

80
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:10,540
没谈过
No.

81
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:14,370
我吓到你了吗
Do I scare you?

82
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,400
你为什么会吓到我
Now, why would you scare me?

83
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:19,520
- 因为我开始看穿你了 - 是吗
- Because I'm starting to see you. - Oh, are you?

84
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,190
看穿你的面具
See past the mask.

85
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:22,270
什么面具
- What mask?

86
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:24,160
你有很多面具
- Oh, there are dozens.

87
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:27,200
这为什么会吓到我呢
And why would that scare me?

88
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:30,000
我还不知道
I don't know yet.

89
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,580
我要给队伍里 扩充一位新的一级行动员
I'm bringing a new Tier-One to the team.

90
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,200

- 格雷斯什么时候批准的  - 今天早上

你今天早上跟格雷斯联系了
You spoke to Grace this morning?

93
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:49,060
你应该知道除了咱俩的“任务” 我还有别的任务吧
You know I have other missions besides ours, right?

94
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,270

再说了 我们需要她 她以前在精英小队跟着我干过
Plus we need her. She worked for me on Bravo Team.

98
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:02,120
这是类似于将死之人的愿望吗
This like a Make-A-Wish thing?

99
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:05,200
我愿意用性命相信她
I trust her with my life.

100

107
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:29,160
这是我们的新一级行动员吗

108
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:31,440
梅森 这位是塞莱斯特格雷厄姆

她并不能
She can't.

00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,500
“她”可是就坐在这里

Her Tier-One clearance went through, what, 36 hours ago?

118
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:54,350
别这样 梅森 这算什么 刁难新人吗
Oh, come on, Mason. What is this? Haze week?

119
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:56,100
这是你们特有的前戏吗
Is this your version of foreplay?

00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,480
安德斯和戴维克 经营着一家残酷的犯罪企业

他们已经开始扩张了
They've started to expand.

126
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:10,350
戴维克是打手 安德斯是军师
Davik is the muscle. Anders is the brains.

127
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,730
他要危险得多

130
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:19,940
我们最近拿到了 安德斯最新创作的部分示意图
We recently retrieved a partial schematic of Anders's latest creation.

131
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:21,980
他喜欢称之为奥兹钥匙
He likes to call it the Oz Key.

132
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:23,020
“奥兹钥匙”
- "The Oz Key"? - If he completes it,

133
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:26,870
他一旦完成 奥兹钥匙 将能够黑进全国的基础设施

137
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:37,830
不可能
It's impossible.

138
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:42,230
单说计算能力 需要新罕布什尔州 那么大的服务器场才能满足
The computational power alone would require a server farm the size of New Hampshire. Not to mention the fact that the source data-- which,

139
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:46,190
更不用说几乎是核心的源数据了
if I understand you correctly, is basically everything--

140
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:47,900
这将需要数千艾字节
that would entail thousands of exabytes of data.

141
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:51,540
需要整个马萨诸塞州 才能存得下那些二进制的数据
So I guess you could take over Massachusetts while you're at it to house all those ones and zeroes.

142
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:54,850
所以 除非 阿姆斯特丹的面积大幅增加
So, unless Amsterdam's gotten a whole lot bigger than I remember,

143
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:58,350
否则安德斯在完成奥兹钥匙之前 还有很长一段路要走
your boy Anders has a long way to go before he gets his Oz Key.

144
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:00,560
- 她挺聪明的 - 她比你聪明
She's smart. - Smarter than you.

145
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,310
- 但她错了 - 我没错
- But she's wrong. I'm not wrong.

146
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:03,900
你错了 但你确实很有说服力
You are, but you were convincing.

147
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:06,000
这也就是她很完美的原因
Which is what makes her perfect.

148
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:10,480
而且 她还有个双胞胎兄弟 就像安德斯一样
Plus... she has a twin brother. Just like Anders.

149
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:13,270
- 还有一个跟你一样的人  - 大卫
There's another one of you out there? - David.

150
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:15,190
- 你们关系近吗  - 一提他我就来气
- You close? - Hate him with a passion.

151
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:16,290
那看来你们关系很近
- Mm, so you're close.

152
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:17,560
形影不离
Inseparable.

153
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,810
- 而且我说对了 - 我可没那么说
- And I'm right. - I didn't say that.

154
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:21,580
虽然你从不承认 但我总是对的
Well, you never do, but I always am.

155
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:24,650
我以前在守誓者民兵组织当过卧底
I've been undercover before with the Oath Keepers.

156
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,650
当了多久
- How long for?

157
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,410
- 三个星期 - 三个星期
- Three weeks. Three weeks.

158
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:31,600
在卧底方面 纳迪亚在精英小队里教过你什么
What did Nadia teach you over in Bravo about going undercover?

159
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:35,830
她教我 当卧底的关键 是学会如何圆谎
She taught me that the key to being undercover is learning how to maintain the lie.

160
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:38,810
纳迪亚认为好间谍一定要擅长撒谎
Mm. Nadia thinks a great spy has to be a great liar.

161
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:40,450
- 确实是 - 不是的
- They do. - No.

162
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:43,870
优秀的间谍需要说真话
A great spy needs to tell the truth.

163
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:50,160
但首先 你必须要“消失”
But first, you have to disappear.

164
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:54,910
任务日：03

165
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:01,700
你需要做到照着镜子 觉得镜中的人与自己判若两人
You need to look in the mirror and see an entirely different person looking back.

166
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,910
阿姆斯特丹

167
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,160
你能在铁面酒吧找到安德斯
You'll find Anders at the Ironside Bar.

168
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:16,950
那里是他兄弟二人 共同经营的洗钱前沿阵地之一
It's one of the laundering fronts he runs with his brother.

169
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:27,730
看来你是一位工程师啊
We got an engineer over here. You must be a mad man,

170
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:30,580
你肯定是个疯子 我绝对会离你远点
I'm definitely staying away from you.

171
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,200
我叫安德斯
I'm Anders.

172
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:37,350
我叫布瑞尔
- Brielle.

173
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:38,540
布瑞尔
- Brielle.

174
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:47,400
别想方设法试图让他爱上你
Don't worry about making him fall in love with you.

175
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:49,560
而是你要爱上他
You need to fall in love with him.

176
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,910
找到他值得你爱的地方 这样才能感觉真实
Find things to love about him, so it'll feel real.

177
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,660
任务日：19

178
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,850
当卧底的时候不能撒谎
You can't lie when you're undercover.

179
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:12,730
安德斯和戴维克这种人 立马就能知道你在撒谎
Men like Anders and Davik will smell it

180
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:14,660
一旦被他们发现 他们会杀了你
from across the room. And if they do, they'll bury you alive.

181
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:19,790
要想让他们相信你的谎言
The only way they're gonna believe your lie

182
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,290
首先你自己要信
is if you do.

183
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,690
你跟他们所说的一切 都要成为你自认为的真话
Everything you tell them has to become your truth.

184
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:27,580
你要骗自己
You have to lie to yourself.

185
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:31,120
任务日：46

186
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:35,580
你的任务是 收集关于奥兹钥匙的所有情报
Your mission is to gather all intel on the Oz Key.

187
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:37,790
不惜任何代价
Do whatever it takes.

188
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:39,870
尽可能接近
Get as close as you can.

189
00:12:57,870 --> 00:13:00,950
这曲子真好听 你在创作新歌
It's a beautiful melody. You creating a new song?

190
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:03,750
我在试着创作
I'm trying.

191
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,540
那你又在创作什么
What about you? What are you creating?

192
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:11,200
你看到我给那个东西 不断地写代码 重写代码了吗
You see me writing and rewriting the code for that thing.

193
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,080
那是什么
What is it?

194
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,700
这取决于你问谁
Depends on who you ask.

195
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,660
你想让它变成什么
What do you want it to be?

196
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:23,500
我只想要你
I just want you.

197
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:26,200
你已经拥有我了
You already have me.

198
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:30,230
最困难的部分在于 要牢记你为什么会在那里
The hardest part is gonna be remembering why you're there.

199
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:32,370
要牢记那不是你的人生
That it's not actually your life.

200
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:38,500
我会一直拴着你的
I will keep you tethered.

201
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:41,650
你每周都要跟我报平安 给我打电话
Every week you check in with me.

202
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:44,410
我会提醒你什么才是真实的
Call me. I will remind you what is real, what is true.

203
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:48,580
伦敦

204
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:51,200
我知道就在这里某个位置
I know it's back here somewhere.

205
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:54,290
我说过吧
Told you.

206
00:13:57,950 --> 00:13:59,200
一点都不像个姑娘
Not very ladylike.

207
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:00,830
为什么现在说这个
Mm. Why start now?

208
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:04,450
你说服了德米特里
You had Dmitri convinced.

209
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:11,040
现在我们知道了希尔杰两兄弟 在维也纳跟谁合作
Now we know who the Silje brothers are working with in Vienna.

210
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,450
伦敦 维也纳
London. Vienna.

211
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:20,400
看来咱俩这段高质量的相处时光 要谢谢安德斯和戴维克了
I guess we have Anders and Davik to thank for all of this quality time together.

212
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:22,500
那你穿着这条漂亮裙子 我该谢谢谁
Who do I have to thank for this dress?

213
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:52,100
塞莱斯特难以自拔了
Celeste's in over her head.

214
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:53,650
她已经失联三个月了
She's been dark for three months.

215
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,730
没有报平安 也没有回应我的信号弹
No check-ins, no click-backs to any of my flares.

216
00:14:55,930 --> 00:14:57,100
但是全面攻破
But a full breach? It's too soon.

217
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,230
有点太早了吧
You know what it's like on the inside.

218
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:01,850
你也知道打入内部是什么样的 可能有数不清的原因
There could be infinite reasons why she didn't check in.

219
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:05,350
如果是你去当卧底 我倒想看看这场好戏 可惜卧底是她
And if it were you in there I'd be willing to see how it plays out. But it's not you.

220
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:06,940
她跟我能力一样强
She's just as capable as I am.

221
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:09,000
这正是我所担心的
That's what I'm worried about.

222
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:11,440
卡特发现了一些异常情况
Carter picked up some anomalies.

223
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:12,600
什么异常情况
- What anomalies?

224
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,940
可能不严重 也可能极为严重
- Could be nothing. Could be everything.

225
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:16,560
我一直在调查她的背景
I've been digging deeper into her life.

226
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:19,270
她的双胞胎兄弟大卫 有严重的赌博问题
Her twin brother David, he's got a serious gambling problem.

227
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:20,690
严重到赌资涉及六位数
Six figures serious.

228
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:24,560
他躲起来了 有些危险的人正在找他
He's holed up somewhere because some very dangerous people are after him.

229
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:25,690
所以呢
So?

230
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:29,350
当心爱的人处于危险之中时 人们就会做蠢事
You and I both know that people do stupid things when the ones they love are on the line.

231
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:32,000
她可以高价卖掉奥兹钥匙
She can sell the Oz Key for a lot of money.

232
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:35,190
你这是在无中生有
You're seeing things that aren't there, Mason.

233
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:37,900
有消息称 戴维克正在找买家
There's chatter on the wire that Davik's looking for a buyer.

234
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:41,400
所以奥兹钥匙就算不能完全运转 但也差不多了
So it's safe to assume the Oz Key is close to, if not fully operational.

235
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:43,830
- 只是时间早晚的问题… - 太早了
It's only a matter of time before... - It's too soon.

236
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:47,270
我知道她是你的朋友 但如果奥兹钥匙被任何人拿到
- I know she's your friend but if anyone gets their hands on the Oz Key,

237
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:50,850
我们就无法掌控奥兹钥匙 也失去了限制他们能力的机会
any chance of holding them at bay, any chance of keeping their power in check is gone.

238
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:52,750
我要派遣特别行动队
I'm sending in an ops team.

239
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,620
在这地方放钱包 真奇怪
Odd place to store a purse.

240
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:42,830
安德斯肯定会很想你的
Anders is gonna miss you terribly.

241
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:18,900
我从特别行动队那里收到了最新情况
I just got an update from the ops team.

242
00:17:19,090 --> 00:17:21,730
双方交火 我们有伤亡
Shots were exchanged and we've got casualties.

243
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:23,150
- 有多少  - 很多
- How many? - Enough.

244
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:24,750
天啊 塞莱斯特呢
Jesus. Celeste?

245
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,080
她还活着
She's alive.

246
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:28,120
被揍了 但还活着
Uh, beat up, but alive.

247
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,370
我们抓到了安德斯
We captured Anders,

248
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,480
戴维克不见了
Davik disappeared.

249
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,700
奥兹钥匙呢
The Oz Key?

250
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:37,940
行动队队长说他们没找到
Ops chief said they couldn't find it.

251
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:38,910
妈的
Fuck!

252
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:55,440
机密 她拿走了箱子

253
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,450
别提这件事 永远别提

254
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:09,700
还剩30秒
Thirty seconds out.

255
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,790
医疗舱就位 迎接伤员进入
Secure med bay for incoming.

256
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:14,700
医疗舱待命
Med bay's on standby.

257
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,200
把她放在第二审讯室
Put her in Interrogation Two.

258
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:21,950
那他呢
What about him?

259
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:25,870
稳定他的状态 让他能开口
Stabilize him well enough to talk.

260
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:29,730
是谁的责任
Who's on point?

261
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:30,730
是我
I am.

262
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:33,520
戴维克不见了 奥兹钥匙到底在哪
Davik's gone. And where the hell's the Oz Key?

263
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,850
我们着手去办
We'll get under it.

264
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:36,160
把事情处理好
Clean this up.

265
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:42,830
- 我想进审讯室 - 不行
- I want in the box. - No.

266
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,650
- 我不是在请求 - 你俩关系太近了
- I'm not asking your permission. - You're too close.

267
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,450
- 梅森 - 你俩关系太近了
- Mason. - You're too close.

268
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:53,980
开始录音
Begin recording.

269
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:55,370
这纯属胡闹
This is bullshit.

270
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:57,270
名字和级别
- Name and classification.

271
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:59,060
这些都他妈的不重要了
- None of that fucking matters anymore, Mason.

272
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:00,250
系统 身份识别
- System Identify. - Identified.

273
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:05,000
- 一级行动员身份识别完毕… - 塞莱斯特格雷厄姆
- Tier-One Operator. Celeste Graham.

274
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:08,020
奥兹钥匙在哪
Where is the Oz Key?

275
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:09,790
你他妈在逗我吗
Are you fucking kidding me?

276
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,330
放松点 梅森
Easy, Mason.

277
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:14,270
你就不应该在这里跟我浪费时间
You shouldn't be in here wasting your time with me.

278
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:18,200
你应该出去机动 追捕戴维克
You should be out there, mobilizing, hunting Davik!

279
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,370
松开手铐
Remove restraints.

280
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:33,200
这是示好吗 为了让我心怀感激吗
Is that supposed to be a gesture? To make me feel grateful?

281
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,060
塞莱斯特 你把奥兹钥匙怎么样了
What did you do with the Oz Key, Celeste?

282
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:42,060
我告诉过你了 在我的应急响应包里
I told you, it was in my go bag.

283
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:43,730
你的应急响应包是空的
Your go bag was empty.

284
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:46,750
特别行动队清了场 他们只找到了这个
Ops cleaned the site. All they found was this.

285
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:49,660
这是假的
It's a fake.

286
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,080
里边到底发生了什么事
What happened in there?

287
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:55,450
她在里边吗
Is she in there?

288
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,910
纳迪亚 你在里边吗
Nadia, are you in there?

289
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:04,950
你觉得是我拿走了
You think I took it?

290
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:09,580
- 你要藏在镜子后面吗  - 坐下 塞莱斯特
You're gonna hide behind a mirror? Sit down, Celeste.

291
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:12,910
经历了这么多事之后 你居然觉得是我拿的
After everything?! You think I'd do that?

292
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:14,290
去你妈的
Fuck you!

293
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,580
纳迪亚 你能听到吗
Do you hear me, Nadia?

294
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:21,250
你当初就不应该让我加入
You never should have brought me on.

295
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:30,730
过去三个月 你错过了每一个接头地点
For the last three months you've missed every one of your Live Drops.

296
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:33,270
是你违反协定在先
You were the one who broke protocol, Mason.

297
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:35,230
我还没有准备好 你就派了特别行动队
Sent an ops team before I was ready.

298
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:36,850
是你没给我选择的余地
You didn't give me a choice, did you?

299
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:39,980
你失联了好几周 我们不确定你是否还活着
You went dark for weeks. We didn't know if you were dead.

300
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:42,350
- 戴维克在哪  - 我把他安置在了地下室
- Where is Davik? - I secured him in the basement.

301
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:44,600
- 他不在地下室 - 我就是把他放在那里了
He wasn't there. That is where I left him.

302
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:48,160
你周围的各种人和各种物件都不见了
People and things just disappearing around you left and right?

303
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,250
去死吧
Go to hell.

304
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:53,500
好吧
Okay.

305
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,750
那我们聊聊大卫
Let's talk about David.

306
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,450
我兄弟跟这有什么关系
What does my brother got to do with any of this?

307
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:06,650
八岁时 你继父向你挥舞滚烫的熨斗 是你兄弟挡在了面前
At eight years old, he stepped in front of your stepdad swinging a hot iron at you.

308
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:10,060
是他挨打了 所以你幸免于难 那一次把他打得够呛
He took all the beatings so you didn't have to. And it fucked him up.

309
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:11,410
你想说什么
Where's this going?

310
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:15,350
我理解你一定深感愧疚
I understand the guilt you must have felt.

311
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:18,080
他为了保护你做了很大的牺牲
He sacrificed so much to protect you.

312
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:22,330
后来 在你继父对他的各种行径之后 你实在无力挽回他
Then after all your stepdad did to him, you couldn't fix him.

313
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:26,400
但你卖掉奥兹钥匙 就能借此保全大卫的性命
But you sell the Oz Key and you can save his life,

314
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:28,370
支付他头顶的赏金
pay the bounty on his head.

315
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:30,370
去你的 梅森
Fuck you, Mason.

316
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:40,080
你认识这栋楼吗
You recognize this building?

317
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:42,950
放大8C单元
Zoom in to unit 8C.

318
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,080
那是谁
Who is that?

319
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:54,600
梅森 我兄弟 跟这件事一点关系都没有
Mason, my brother has nothing to do with this.

320
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,650
但他却处处跟你有关系
But he has everything to do with you.

321
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,650
你每周给他打一次电话 每个月给他寄八百美元
You call him once a week. You send him $800 a month.

322
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:03,270
即使在创业孵化器毫无收获时 你也用了自己的积蓄给他付钱
Even when you were at the Incubator making nothing, you paid him out of your savings.

323
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:05,750
- 你兄弟是个废人 - 闭嘴
Your brother seems like a fuckup to me. Shut up.

324
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:07,700
战术小队 武装系统
Tac Unit, arm system.

325
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,080
系统已武装
System armed.

326
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:12,350
- 住手 - 告诉我奥兹钥匙在哪
- Stop. - Tell me where the Oz Key is.

327
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:13,940
我他妈真不知道
I don't know, I really don't fucking know.

328
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:17,120
你说你和兄弟关系很好 你俩间隔38秒先后出生 对吗
You said you and your brother were close. What, 38 seconds apart?

329
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:19,350
- 锁定目标 - 住手
Tac Unit, acquire target. Stop.

330
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:20,700
目标已锁定
Target acquired.

331
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,600
你为了他而卖了奥兹钥匙 不是吗
You sold it for him, didn't you?

332
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:25,690
承认吧
Admit it.

333
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:27,310
- 买家是谁  - 谁也没有
Who's your buyer? - Nobody.

334
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:28,450
最后一次机会
-- Last chance!

335
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:32,540
- 执… - 够了
- Tac Unit, exec... - Enough.

336
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:39,480
你觉得你刚才是在干什么
The fuck do you think you were doing?

337
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,060
我没准备把他干掉
I wasn't actually gonna take him out.

338
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:42,480
但你刚才听起来是认真的
Oh, yeah? You sounded pretty convincing.

339
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:45,400
- 不能打断审讯  - 刚才那根本不是审讯
You can't stop an interrogation! That wasn't a fucking interrogation!

340
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:48,060
那是在攻击我们自己人
That was an assault on one of our own!

341
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:50,440
塞莱斯特没拿奥兹钥匙
Celeste didn't take the Oz Key.

342
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,230
她说把奥兹钥匙藏在了应急响应包里 戴维克发现后拿走了
She said she hid it in her go bag. Davik had to have found the bag and taken it.

343
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:57,270
那是他在地下室被反绑的时候 还是从后门逃走的时候拿走的
When? When he was tied up in the basement? Or when he fled out the back?

344
00:22:57,470 --> 00:23:00,520
你问问塞莱斯特 再问问特别行动队 回答完全是两个故事
You ask Celeste, you ask Ops, you get two different fucking stories.

345
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,400
我认识她五年了
I've known her for five years, Mason.

346
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:04,910
我比这里的任何人都了解她
I know her better than anyone here.

347
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:07,700
她没拿
She didn't take it.

348
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,690
现在戴维克知道了她是卧底
And now Davik knows that she was undercover.

349
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:15,540
戴维克视她为累赘 所以会来追杀她的
She's a liability to him, and he's gonna come after her.

350
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,870
- 她说得对 - 我们得让她脱身 格雷斯
She's right. We have to get her out, Grace.

351
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:24,400
她最好的选择 就是被转移到一个独立的安全屋
Her best option is to relocate her to an unaffiliated safe house.

352
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:26,770
我可以联络一些军情六处的联系人
I can reach out to some MI6 contacts.

353
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:28,040
那是必须的
It'll have to do.

354
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:33,450
安德斯醒了 你们应该去审审他
Anders is awake. You should interview him.

355
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,000
我去吧
I'll do it.

356
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:44,330
别告诉我你们相信塞莱斯特
Do not tell me you believe Celeste.

357
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:46,020
纳迪亚信她
Nadia does.

358
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:48,660
她救过纳迪亚的命 纳迪亚当然信她了
She saved Nadia's life. Of course she does.

359
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:51,020
塞莱斯特拿到了奥兹钥匙
Celeste had the Oz Key.

360
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:53,100
她失联了三个月
She went dark for three months.

361
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,580
然后钥匙就消失了
Then it disappears?

362
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,350
她耍了我们所有人
I mean, come on, she's working all of us.

363
00:23:56,550 --> 00:23:59,150
无论是堡垒 安德斯还是戴维克 她需要谁就为谁卖命
Citadel, Anders and Davik, anyone she needs to to make a buck

364
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:03,350
就为了赚钱给自己兄弟还债 救他的性命
for herself so she can pay off her brother's debt and save his life.

365
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:04,650
那我们该怎么办
So what do we do?

366
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:06,790
我们向指挥部提出询问
We open an inquiry with Command.

367
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:10,040
我们对她启用后盾
We backstop her.

368
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:12,520
梅森
Mason.

369
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,060
我们不能就这样删除她的记忆
We can't just erase her memory.

370
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:16,540
她可是一级行动员 格雷斯
She's Tier-One, Grace.

371
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:20,600
她掌握堡垒的一切 你要让她这样回到现实中去吗
She knows everything about Citadel. You gonna let her out in the world with that information?

372
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,810
她会把我们出卖给出价最高的人
She'll sell us out to the highest bidder.

373
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:24,600
我们必须清除她的记忆
- We have to wipe her clean.

374
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:27,810
指挥部甚至都还没有批准 后盾的安全流程
- Command hasn't even approved Backstop's safety procedures yet.

375
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:28,940
这技术太新了
It's too new.

376
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:31,560
你光是提出这个建议 我就能对你施加惩罚
I could have you sanctioned for even suggesting something like that.

377
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:35,250
在你担任主管期间 内奸搞垮了堡垒 你想被贴上这个标签吗
You want to be known as the director who let a mole take down the agency?

378
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:41,660
我无法授权启用后盾
I can't authorize the backstop.

379
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:44,900
不需要你授权
You don't have to.

380
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:46,660
我们可以换个地方执行
We'd do it off-site.

381
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:49,190
不需要让任何人知道
No one needs to know.

382
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:52,310
瞒着纳迪亚 瞒着指挥部 瞒着所有人
Not Nadia. Not Command. No one.

383
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:53,700
我会处理好的
I'll take care of it.

384
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:58,810
如果最后能证明她的话是真的 我们再把她带回来
Look, if what she says turns out to be true,

385
00:24:59,010 --> 00:25:01,200
重新激活她的记忆 就好像什么事都没发生过一样
we'll bring her back, reactivate her memories like nothing happened.

386
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,270
如果是她干的呢
And what if she did it?

387
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:05,520
那就让她处于 被启用后盾的状态 让她坐牢
Then she stays backstopped. Goes to prison.

388
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,450
这样一来 堡垒的机密是安全的
But Citadel's secrets are safe.

389
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:19,160
我们要怎么跟她说
What are we gonna tell her?

390
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:29,810
- 把这个戴上 - 这是什么
I'm gonna need you to put this on. - What the hell is that?

391
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:32,440
能停用你的ARC芯片 以及你在堡垒的所有证明
- It deactivates your ARC chip and the rest of your Citadel creds.

392
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,900
- 为什么要停用  - 我们要带你离开这里
Why would I want that? We're getting you out of here.

393
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:38,190
戴维克知道你是谁 他会来追杀你和你兄弟的
Davik knows who you are. He's gonna come after you and your brother.

394
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:40,310
我们要把你转移至安全屋
We're gonna relocate you to a safe house.

395
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:41,310
安全屋
A safe house?

396
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:42,520
回头再细说 眼下来说…
There'll be time to talk later. For now...

397
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,440
他肯定能找到安全屋的位置
You don't think he'll be able to sniff out a safe house?

398
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,270
你们能找到我兄弟 他肯定也能找到
You were able to find my brother. Think about how easy it will be for them to do the same.

399
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:48,480
那你的建议是什么
-Then what do you suggest?

400
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:51,560
我不知道 但你迅速提醒了所有人 这次是你的行动
I don't know, Mason. But you're real quick to remind everyone this is your op.

401
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:55,790
既然是你的行动搞砸了 那你何不自己想办法呢
Well, your op turned into a clusterfuck. So why don't you figure it out.

402
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:02,250
还有一个选项
There is another option.

403
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:05,350
这是一个即将推出的新程序
It's a new program soon to be rolled out.

404
00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:08,560
适用于处境极为不利的一级行动员
Meant for Tier-One Operators in a worst-case scenario.

405
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,730
能确保他们消失
If, for whatever reason, they have to disappear.

406
00:26:10,930 --> 00:26:14,350
你将被带到墨西哥城的一个设施 在那里被注射镇静剂
You'll be taken to a facility in Mexico City. You'd be sedated.

407
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:17,310
在镇静期间 他们会对你进行两场无痛手术
While you're under, they'll perform a pair of painless procedures

408
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:21,020
重塑你的角膜和指纹脊 帮助你隐姓埋名
to reshape your cornea and the ridges of your fingerprints to help you hide.

409
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:23,540
你以后就不是塞莱斯特格雷厄姆了 而会是另一个人
You won't be Celeste Graham anymore. You'll be someone else.

410
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,290
会变成戴维克永远找不到的人
Someone that Davik can never find.

411
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,790
所以这算是证人转移
So it's Witness Relocation?

412
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,540
没错 你和你兄弟都是如此
That's right. For you and your brother.

413
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:38,580
尘埃落定之后 我可以回归我的生活吗
And when the dust settles, I can just get back to my life?

414
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:41,450
这是保护你的最佳方式
It's the best way to protect you.

415
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:46,660
那我们就这么办吧
Let's do it.

416
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:49,120
把她藏起来 直到我们可以撤离
Keep her hidden till we can evac.

417
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:57,580
我们不能把真相告诉纳迪亚
We can't tell Nadia the truth.

418
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:12,830
搞定了吗
Is it done?

419
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:14,540
重新安置好她了吗
She resettled?

420
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:17,330
我亲自打的电话
I made the call myself.

421
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:19,660
她正在前往安全屋的途中
She's on route to the safe house.

422
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:22,830
格雷斯 谢谢你做的一切
Thank you, Grace, for everything.

423
00:27:23,290 --> 00:27:24,500
先别着急谢我
Don't thank me yet.

424
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,660
我们还需要找到奥兹钥匙
We need to find the Oz Key.

425
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:30,660
是的
Yeah.

426
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:32,790
我们在找了
We're on it.

427
00:27:53,870 --> 00:27:54,790
有眉目吗
Any luck?

428
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:58,000
还没有戴维克的迹象 我们还在找
No sign of Davik yet. We're still looking.

429
00:27:58,450 --> 00:28:00,040
你觉得这个怎么样
What do you think of this one?

430
00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:07,230
很温馨 很典雅
Uh... Cozy. Classic.

431
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:08,750
这是在俄勒冈州
Yeah, it's in Oregon.

432
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:11,690
我祖母住过的小镇
Small town my grandmother lived in.

433
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:13,940
你给塞莱斯特 也安排了2点5个孩子吗
Did you give her 2.5 kids, too?

434
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:16,910
你想凭空捏造生活吗 随你便
You want to invent a life out of thin air? Be my guest.

435
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,900
听我说 如果被指挥部发现了
Look at, um, what happens if Command catches wind

436
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:24,100
你私自启用后盾程序怎么办
you back-channeled an unsanctioned Backstop procedure?

437
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:28,190
我可能会逃跑吧 也许我会就此安顿 过上简单的生活
I'd have to go on the run, I guess. Maybe I'd settle down for the simple life.

438
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:30,020
那我花钱也愿意看
Yeah, I'd pay to see that.

439
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:32,690
经历过这一天之后  不想想这栋房子吗
After a day like today, that house?

440
00:28:32,890 --> 00:28:35,290
看看这门廊 还有凉爽的夏日微风
That porch? Cool summer breeze?

441
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:39,410
天啊 你肯定连五分钟都撑不住
Man, you wouldn't last five minutes.

442
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:45,160
谢谢你还我人情
Thanks for calling in a favor.

443
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:48,040
对 安妮梅希亚 她是个老朋友
Yeah, Ana Mejía, she's an old friend.

444
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:51,540
她用后盾创造出了非常特别的东西
She created something very special with Backstop.

445
00:28:54,370 --> 00:28:56,370
我们需要毁掉塞莱斯特的药剂
We need to destroy Celeste's vial.

446
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:59,410
永久删除她的记忆
Erase her memories permanently.

447
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:06,580
梅森 你确定塞莱斯特是内奸吗
Mason, are you sure that Celeste is a mole?

448
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,000
我知道
I know it.

449
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:10,950
你必须很笃定才行
You have to be certain.

450
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:17,410
因为以前我有一次不是很笃定 后来每天都在后悔
Because one time I wasn't and... I think about it every day.

451
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:19,500
我很笃定
I am certain.

452
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:22,150
这件事开弓没有回头箭
You do this, you know there's no going back.

453
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:23,400
我就是要这个效果
That's the point.

454
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:25,080
我不是说她
I'm not talking about her.

455
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,620
我说的是你
I'm talking about you.

456
00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:29,950
加到命令里
Put in the order.

457
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,690
- 听我说… - 加到命令里
- Listen to me... - Put in the order.

458
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:35,750
听我说
Listen to me.

459
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:37,850
如果你错怪了她
If you're wrong about her,

460
00:29:38,050 --> 00:29:41,790
这件事情是不可逆的
this is not something that you can come back from.

461
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:44,160
不可逆
You can't.

462
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:48,950
一名间谍可能有一百个名字 一百张脸 一百个身份
A spy can have a hundred names, a hundred faces, a hundred identities.

463
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:52,290
但灵魂却只有一个
But you only get one soul.

464
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:59,080
我们要不惜任何代价保护堡垒
We have to protect Citadel at all costs.

465
00:29:59,910 --> 00:30:00,910
这是你告诉我的
You told me that.

466
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:04,370
那谁来保护你呢
Mm-hmm. But who's going to protect you?

467
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,410
不用担心我
Don't worry about me.

468
00:30:13,410 --> 00:30:16,410
堡垒后盾设施 墨西哥城

469
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:29,700
放松就好…
Just relax and breathe naturally.

470
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:47,080
卡特告诉我 塞莱斯特已经被转移到了俄勒冈州
Carter told me Celeste has been relocated to Oregon.

471
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:49,540
梅森 谢谢你支持她
Thanks for having her back, Mason.

472
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:53,910
也谢谢你支持我
And mine.

473
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:23,950
你还好吗
You good?

474
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:25,660
还好
Yep.

475
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:30,660
奥兹钥匙有消息吗
Any news on the Oz Key?

476
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:32,750
没有
Nothing.

477
00:31:37,910 --> 00:31:39,330
不是戴维克拿的
Davik didn't take it.

478
00:31:41,330 --> 00:31:43,580
而且你认为也不是塞莱斯特拿的
And you don't think Celeste was the one that took it either.

479
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:45,700
什么意思
Excuse me?

480
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:50,480
我是唯一能够访问 堡垒所有加密通信的人
I am the only one with access to all of Citadel's encrypted communications.

481
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,660
那是我的工作
That's my job.

482
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:54,080
这你是知道的 对吧
You know that, right?

483
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:59,330
兄弟 我认识你十年了
I have known you a decade, brother.

484
00:32:00,290 --> 00:32:02,910
我熟悉你的行为习惯和思维方式
I know your behavior patterns, how you think.

485
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:05,870
你今天的表现很不像你
You acted very out of character today.

486
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:08,790
我们处于危机之中
We were in crisis mode.

487
00:32:09,370 --> 00:32:10,370
那倒是
Right.

488
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:15,290
我一开始没想到 但我快速查询了我们的服务器
I didn't think to at first, but I scrubbed our servers.

489
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:19,230
发现有位一级特工向特别行动队队长 秘密发送了一条指令
And I found that a cloaked order was given to the chief of the ops team by a Tier-One agent in secret.

490
00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:23,910
而这条命令是违反协议的
And against protocol.

491
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:29,230
那位一级特工命令特别行动队队长 把奥兹钥匙藏起来
That Tier-One ordered the chief to conceal the Oz Key

492
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:31,480
并在回来后交给他们
and deliver it to them on their return.

493
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:35,040
- 我知道你知道那个特工是谁 - 别说了 卡特
And I know you know who that agent was. Stop there, Carter.

494
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:40,450
那条秘密指令是纳迪亚下的
Nadia gave the cloaked order.

495
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,190
你说过你对塞莱斯特启用了后盾
You said that you backstopped Celeste

496
00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:49,440
这样她就不能泄露堡垒的任何秘密
so she couldn't give up any Citadel secrets,

497
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,200
但我认为你那样做
but I think you did

498
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,080
是为了阻止我们发现她没有罪证
that to stop us from finding out that she didn't have any.

499
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,330
阻止我们发现她是无辜的
She was clean.

500
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:02,400
你为了让塞莱斯特代人受罪 所以一直对她假意怀疑
You needed to keep suspicion on Celeste to have her take the fall.

501
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:05,560
这样一来你就能对她启用后盾 抹去她的记忆
So you backstopped her, erased her memories.

502
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,690
并不是因为她对堡垒构成了威胁
Not because she was a threat to Citadel,

503
00:33:07,890 --> 00:33:09,650
而是因为她会对纳迪亚构成威胁
But because she would be a threat to Nadia.

504
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:12,750
因为你是在保护纳迪亚
Because you are protecting Nadia.

505
00:33:19,410 --> 00:33:21,290
因为虽然你很爱她…
Because even though you love her...

506
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:27,250
但你认为她可能是内奸
...you think Nadia might be a mole.

507
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,620
这些话你永远不要再提
Don't you ever say those words again.

508
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:45,120
就是你干的
You-you did this.

509
00:33:46,450 --> 00:33:47,540
我干了什么
What did I do?

510
00:33:48,370 --> 00:33:49,370
不是你
Not you.

511
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:52,660
是她
Her.

512
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,370
你不能相信她
You can't trust her.

513
00:34:10,950 --> 00:34:12,020
为什么不行
Why not?

514
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:13,270
纳迪亚
Nadia?

515
00:34:13,470 --> 00:34:14,770
《堡垒》下集精彩看点

516
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:17,440
你杀了数千名特工
You killed thousands of agents.

517
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:18,940
功劳不能都归我一人
I can't take all the credit.

518
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:21,790
一位堡垒的特工背叛了你们所有人
A Citadel spy betrayed you all.

519
00:34:24,330 --> 00:34:25,910
我已经不知道你是谁了
I don't know who you are anymore.

520
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:30,600
我们都没有自己想象的那么清白 这你是知道的
None of us are as clean as we want to be. And you know that.

521
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,250
我想知道真相
You want to know the truth?

522
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:38,160
