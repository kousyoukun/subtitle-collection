巴黎向來都很有意思
Paris always is.

68
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:39,410
“向來”
Always is?

69
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,900
你不會以為你是唯一一個 陪我來過巴黎的男人吧
You can't possibly believe you're the only man I've come to Paris with.

70
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:45,500
那倒是 但昨晚很顯然…
No, but last night was obviously...

71
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:47,950
- 質量很高 - 很高
It was up there. Up there.

能排進前五
Top five.

73
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,000
另外四位是間諜嗎
And the other four? Are they spies?

74
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:56,040
拜托 凱恩 我可不會宣揚自己的風流史
Mm. Come on, Kane. I don't kiss and tell.

75
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:57,450
談了很久嗎
They last long?

76
00:06:58,790 --> 00:06:59,830
沒有一個長久的
They never do.

77
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:02,290
你談過戀愛嗎
You ever been in love?

78
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:05,600
你這算是什么問題
What kind of question is that?

79
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,830
真誠的問題
An honest one.

80
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:10,540
沒談過
No.

81
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:14,370
我嚇到你了嗎
Do I scare you?

82
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,400
你為什么會嚇到我
Now, why would you scare me?

83
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:19,520
- 因為我開始看穿你了 - 是嗎
- Because I'm starting to see you. - Oh, are you?

84
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,190
看穿你的面具
See past the mask.

85
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:22,270
什么面具
- What mask?

86
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:24,160
你有很多面具
- Oh, there are dozens.

87
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:27,200
這為什么會嚇到我呢
And why would that scare me?

88
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:30,000
我還不知道
I don't know yet.

89
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,580
我要給隊伍里 擴充一位新的一級行動員
I'm bringing a new Tier-One to the team.

90
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,200
格雷斯批準了
Grace approved.

91
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:43,650
- 格雷斯什么時候批準的  - 今天早上
- When did Grace approve? - This morning.

92
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,660
你今天早上跟格雷斯聯系了
You spoke to Grace this morning?

93
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:49,060
你應該知道除了咱倆的“任務” 我還有別的任務吧
You know I have other missions besides ours, right?

94
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,270
我當時去哪了
- Where was I?

95
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:54,040
不知道 可能在吃法式長棍面包 墜入愛河
- I don't know. Eating baguettes? - Falling in love?

96
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:56,580
她很聰明
She's brilliant.

97
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,940
再說了 我們需要她 她以前在精英小隊跟著我干過
Plus we need her. She worked for me on Bravo Team.

98
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:02,120
這是類似于將死之人的愿望嗎
This like a Make-A-Wish thing?

99
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:05,200
我愿意用性命相信她
I trust her with my life.

100
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:07,810
她救過我的命
She saved it once.

101
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:11,190
她叫塞萊斯特格雷厄姆 你會愛上她的
Her name is Celeste Graham, and you are gonna love her.

102
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:13,060
既然她是你的朋友
Well, if she's a friend of yours,

103
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,700
那我肯定會恨她
I'm sure I'll hate her.

104
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:22,500
堡壘總部

105
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,700
注定躲不過
I mean, it was bound to happen.

106
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:27,330
- 是嗎  - 只不過是時間早晚的問題
- Just a matter of time. - Was it?

107
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:29,160
這是我們的新一級行動員嗎
- This our new Tier-One?

108
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:31,440
梅森 這位是塞萊斯特格雷厄姆
Mason, meet Celeste Graham.

109
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,540
你就是救過她一條命的人
You're the person that saved her life.

110
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:34,750
就是我
I am.

111
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:38,160
她跟我說 我會愛你的
She told me I'm gonna love you.

112
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:40,410
你不會的
You won't.

113
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:43,980
任務日：01

114
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:45,520
她能應付得了
She can handle it.

115
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,750
她并不能
She can't.

116
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,500
“她”可是就坐在這里
She is right here.

117
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:52,060
她的一級許可證 是什么時候獲批的 36小時前嗎
Her Tier-One clearance went through, what, 36 hours ago?

118
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:54,350
別這樣 梅森 這算什么 刁難新人嗎
Oh, come on, Mason. What is this? Haze week?

119
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:56,100
這是你們特有的前戲嗎
Is this your version of foreplay?

120
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,480
安德斯和戴維克 經營著一家殘酷的犯罪企業
Anders and Davik run a brutal criminal enterprise.

121
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,600

- I know who they are. - I don't think you do.

122
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,350
來自阿姆斯特丹的希爾杰兩兄弟
The Silje brothers out of Amsterdam.

123
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:03,690
他們統領著各類罪犯
They rule the city's underbelly.

125
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:07,770
他們已經開始擴張了
They've started to expand.

126
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:10,350
戴維克是打手 安德斯是軍師
Davik is the muscle. Anders is the brains.

127
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,730
他要危險得多
He's far more dangerous.

128
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:14,310
劍橋大學畢業生 一直致力于開發戰爭技術
He's a Cambridge grad who's been developing war technology

129
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:16,060
并將其賣給出價最高的人
and selling it to the highest bidder.

130
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:19,940
我們最近拿到了 安德斯最新創作的部分示意圖
We recently retrieved a partial schematic of Anders's latest creation.

131
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:21,980
他喜歡稱之為奧茲鑰匙
He likes to call it the Oz Key.

132
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:23,020
“奧茲鑰匙”
- "The Oz Key"? - If he completes it,

133
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:26,870
他一旦完成 奧茲鑰匙 將能夠黑進全國的基礎設施

他們可以劫持整個國家
They could take a whole country hostage.

136
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,810
別說不可能 他就是想讓你以為不可能
Don't say it's impossible. He wants you to say it's impossible.

137
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:37,830
不可能
It's impossible.

138
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:42,230
單說計算能力 需要新罕布什爾州 那么大的服務器場才能滿足
The computational power alone would require a server farm the size of New Hampshire. Not to mention the fact that the source data-- which,

139
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:46,190
更不用說幾乎是核心的源數據了
if I understand you correctly, is basically everything--

140
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:47,900
這將需要數千艾字節
that would entail thousands of exabytes of data.

141
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:51,540
需要整個馬薩諸塞州 才能存得下那些二進制的數據
So I guess you could take over Massachusetts while you're at it to house all those ones and zeroes.

142
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:54,850
所以 除非 阿姆斯特丹的面積大幅增加
So, unless Amsterdam's gotten a whole lot bigger than I remember,

143
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:58,350
否則安德斯在完成奧茲鑰匙之前 還有很長一段路要走
your boy Anders has a long way to go before he gets his Oz Key.

144
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:00,560
- 她挺聰明的 - 她比你聰明
She's smart. - Smarter than you.

145
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,310
- 但她錯了 - 我沒錯
- But she's wrong. I'm not wrong.

146
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:03,900
你錯了 但你確實很有說服力
You are, but you were convincing.

147
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:06,000
這也就是她很完美的原因
Which is what makes her perfect.

148
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:10,480
而且 她還有個雙胞胎兄弟 就像安德斯一樣
Plus... she has a twin brother. Just like Anders.

149
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:13,270
- 還有一個跟你一樣的人  - 大衛
There's another one of you out there? - David.

150
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:15,190
- 你們關系近嗎  - 一提他我就來氣
- You close? - Hate him with a passion.

151
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:16,290
那看來你們關系很近
- Mm, so you're close.

152
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:17,560
形影不離
Inseparable.

153
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,810
- 而且我說對了 - 我可沒那么說
- And I'm right. - I didn't say that.

154
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:21,580
雖然你從不承認 但我總是對的
Well, you never do, but I always am.

155
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:24,650
我以前在守誓者民兵組織當過臥底
I've been undercover before with the Oath Keepers.

156
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,650
當了多久
- How long for?

157
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,410
- 三個星期 - 三個星期
- Three weeks. Three weeks.

158
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:31,600
在臥底方面 納迪亞在精英小隊里教過你什么
What did Nadia teach you over in Bravo about going undercover?

159
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:35,830
她教我 當臥底的關鍵 是學會如何圓謊
She taught me that the key to being undercover is learning how to maintain the lie.

160
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:38,810
納迪亞認為好間諜一定要擅長撒謊
Mm. Nadia thinks a great spy has to be a great liar.

161
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:40,450
- 確實是 - 不是的
- They do. - No.

162
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:43,870
優秀的間諜需要說真話
A great spy needs to tell the truth.

163
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:50,160
但首先 你必須要“消失”
But first, you have to disappear.

164
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:54,910
任務日：03

165
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:01,700
你需要做到照著鏡子 覺得鏡中的人與自己判若兩人
You need to look in the mirror and see an entirely different person looking back.

166
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,910
阿姆斯特丹

167
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,160
你能在鐵面酒吧找到安德斯
You'll find Anders at the Ironside Bar.

168
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:16,950
那里是他兄弟二人 共同經營的洗錢前沿陣地之一
It's one of the laundering fronts he runs with his brother.

169
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:27,730
看來你是一位工程師啊
We got an engineer over here. You must be a mad man,

170
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:30,580
你肯定是個瘋子 我絕對會離你遠點
I'm definitely staying away from you.

171
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,200
我叫安德斯
I'm Anders.

172
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:37,350
我叫布瑞爾
- Brielle.

173
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:38,540
布瑞爾
- Brielle.

174
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:47,400
別想方設法試圖讓他愛上你
Don't worry about making him fall in love with you.

175
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:49,560
而是你要愛上他
You need to fall in love with him.

176
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,910
找到他值得你愛的地方 這樣才能感覺真實
Find things to love about him, so it'll feel real.

177
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,660
任務日：19

178
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,850
當臥底的時候不能撒謊
You can't lie when you're undercover.

179
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:12,730
安德斯和戴維克這種人 立馬就能知道你在撒謊
Men like Anders and Davik will smell it

180
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:14,660
一旦被他們發現 他們會殺了你
from across the room. And if they do, they'll bury you alive.

181
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:19,790
要想讓他們相信你的謊言
The only way they're gonna believe your lie

182
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,290
首先你自己要信
is if you do.

183
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,690
你跟他們所說的一切 都要成為你自認為的真話
Everything you tell them has to become your truth.

184
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:27,580
你要騙自己
You have to lie to yourself.

185
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:31,120
任務日：46

186
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:35,580
你的任務是 收集關于奧茲鑰匙的所有情報
Your mission is to gather all intel on the Oz Key.

187
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:37,790
不惜任何代價
Do whatever it takes.

188
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:39,870
盡可能接近
Get as close as you can.

189
00:12:57,870 --> 00:13:00,950
這曲子真好聽 你在創作新歌
It's a beautiful melody. You creating a new song?

190
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:03,750
我在試著創作
I'm trying.

191
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,540
那你又在創作什么
What about you? What are you creating?

192
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:11,200
你看到我給那個東西 不斷地寫代碼 重寫代碼了嗎
You see me writing and rewriting the code for that thing.

193
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,080
那是什么
What is it?

194
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,700
這取決于你問誰
Depends on who you ask.

195
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,660
你想讓它變成什么
What do you want it to be?

196
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:23,500
我只想要你
I just want you.

197
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:26,200
你已經擁有我了
You already have me.

198
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:30,230
最困難的部分在于 要牢記你為什么會在那里
The hardest part is gonna be remembering why you're there.

199
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:32,370
要牢記那不是你的人生
That it's not actually your life.

200
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:38,500
我會一直拴著你的
I will keep you tethered.

201
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:41,650
你每周都要跟我報平安 給我打電話
Every week you check in with me.

202
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:44,410
我會提醒你什么才是真實的
Call me. I will remind you what is real, what is true.

203
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:48,580
倫敦

204
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:51,200
我知道就在這里某個位置
I know it's back here somewhere.

205
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:54,290
我說過吧
Told you.

206
00:13:57,950 --> 00:13:59,200
一點都不像個姑娘
Not very ladylike.

207
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:00,830
為什么現在說這個
Mm. Why start now?

208
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:04,450
你說服了德米特里
You had Dmitri convinced.

209
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:11,040
現在我們知道了希爾杰兩兄弟 在維也納跟誰合作
Now we know who the Silje brothers are working with in Vienna.

210
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,450
倫敦 維也納
London. Vienna.

211
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:20,400
看來咱倆這段高質量的相處時光 要謝謝安德斯和戴維克了
I guess we have Anders and Davik to thank for all of this quality time together.

212
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:22,500
那你穿著這條漂亮裙子 我該謝謝誰
Who do I have to thank for this dress?

213
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:52,100
塞萊斯特難以自拔了
Celeste's in over her head.

214
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:53,650
她已經失聯三個月了
She's been dark for three months.

215
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,730
沒有報平安 也沒有回應我的信號彈
No check-ins, no click-backs to any of my flares.

216
00:14:55,930 --> 00:14:57,100
但是全面攻破
But a full breach? It's too soon.

217
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,230
有點太早了吧
You know what it's like on the inside.

218
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:01,850
你也知道打入內部是什么樣的 可能有數不清的原因
There could be infinite reasons why she didn't check in.

219
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:05,350
如果是你去當臥底 我倒想看看這場好戲 可惜臥底是她
And if it were you in there I'd be willing to see how it plays out. But it's not you.

220
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:06,940
她跟我能力一樣強
She's just as capable as I am.

221
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:09,000
這正是我所擔心的
That's what I'm worried about.

222
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:11,440
卡特發現了一些異常情況
Carter picked up some anomalies.

223
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:12,600
什么異常情況
- What anomalies?

224
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,940
可能不嚴重 也可能極為嚴重
- Could be nothing. Could be everything.

225
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:16,560
我一直在調查她的背景
I've been digging deeper into her life.

226
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:19,270
她的雙胞胎兄弟大衛 有嚴重的賭博問題
Her twin brother David, he's got a serious gambling problem.

227
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:20,690
嚴重到賭資涉及六位數
Six figures serious.

228
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:24,560
他躲起來了 有些危險的人正在找他
He's holed up somewhere because some very dangerous people are after him.

229
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:25,690
所以呢
So?

230
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:29,350
當心愛的人處于危險之中時 人們就會做蠢事
You and I both know that people do stupid things when the ones they love are on the line.

231
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:32,000
她可以高價賣掉奧茲鑰匙
She can sell the Oz Key for a lot of money.

232
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:35,190
你這是在無中生有
You're seeing things that aren't there, Mason.

233
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:37,900
有消息稱 戴維克正在找買家
There's chatter on the wire that Davik's looking for a buyer.

234
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:41,400
所以奧茲鑰匙就算不能完全運轉 但也差不多了
So it's safe to assume the Oz Key is close to, if not fully operational.

235
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:43,830
- 只是時間早晚的問題… - 太早了
It's only a matter of time before... - It's too soon.

236
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:47,270
我知道她是你的朋友 但如果奧茲鑰匙被任何人拿到
- I know she's your friend but if anyone gets their hands on the Oz Key,

237
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:50,850
我們就無法掌控奧茲鑰匙 也失去了限制他們能力的機會
any chance of holding them at bay, any chance of keeping their power in check is gone.

238
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:52,750
我要派遣特別行動隊
I'm sending in an ops team.

239
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,620
在這地方放錢包 真奇怪
Odd place to store a purse.

240
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:42,830
安德斯肯定會很想你的
Anders is gonna miss you terribly.

241
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:18,900
我從特別行動隊那里收到了最新情況
I just got an update from the ops team.

242
00:17:19,090 --> 00:17:21,730
雙方交火 我們有傷亡
Shots were exchanged and we've got casualties.

243
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:23,150
- 有多少  - 很多
- How many? - Enough.

244
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:24,750
天啊 塞萊斯特呢
Jesus. Celeste?

245
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,080
她還活著
She's alive.

246
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:28,120
被揍了 但還活著
Uh, beat up, but alive.

247
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,370
我們抓到了安德斯
We captured Anders,

248
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,480
戴維克不見了
Davik disappeared.

249
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,700
奧茲鑰匙呢
The Oz Key?

250
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:37,940
行動隊隊長說他們沒找到
Ops chief said they couldn't find it.

251
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:38,910
媽的
Fuck!

252
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:55,440
機密 她拿走了箱子

253
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,450
別提這件事 永遠別提

254
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:09,700
還剩30秒
Thirty seconds out.

255
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,790
醫療艙就位 迎接傷員進入
Secure med bay for incoming.

256
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:14,700
醫療艙待命
Med bay's on standby.

257
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,200
把她放在第二審訊室
Put her in Interrogation Two.

258
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:21,950
那他呢
What about him?

259
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:25,870
穩定他的狀態 讓他能開口
Stabilize him well enough to talk.

260
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:29,730
是誰的責任
Who's on point?

261
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:30,730
是我
I am.

262
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:33,520
戴維克不見了 奧茲鑰匙到底在哪
Davik's gone. And where the hell's the Oz Key?

263
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,850
我們著手去辦
We'll get under it.

264
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:36,160
把事情處理好
Clean this up.

265
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:42,830
- 我想進審訊室 - 不行
- I want in the box. - No.

266
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,650
- 我不是在請求 - 你倆關系太近了
- I'm not asking your permission. - You're too close.

267
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,450
- 梅森 - 你倆關系太近了
- Mason. - You're too close.

268
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:53,980
開始錄音
Begin recording.

269
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:55,370
這純屬胡鬧
This is bullshit.

270
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:57,270
名字和級別
- Name and classification.

271
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:59,060
這些都他媽的不重要了
- None of that fucking matters anymore, Mason.

272
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:00,250
系統 身份識別
- System Identify. - Identified.

273
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:05,000
- 一級行動員身份識別完畢… - 塞萊斯特格雷厄姆
- Tier-One Operator. Celeste Graham.

274
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:08,020
奧茲鑰匙在哪
Where is the Oz Key?

275
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:09,790
你他媽在逗我嗎
Are you fucking kidding me?

276
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,330
放松點 梅森
Easy, Mason.

277
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:14,270
你就不應該在這里跟我浪費時間
You shouldn't be in here wasting your time with me.

278
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:18,200
你應該出去機動 追捕戴維克
You should be out there, mobilizing, hunting Davik!

279
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,370
松開手銬
Remove restraints.

280
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:33,200
這是示好嗎 為了讓我心懷感激嗎
Is that supposed to be a gesture? To make me feel grateful?

281
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,060
塞萊斯特 你把奧茲鑰匙怎么樣了
What did you do with the Oz Key, Celeste?

282
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:42,060
我告訴過你了 在我的應急響應包里
I told you, it was in my go bag.

283
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:43,730
你的應急響應包是空的
Your go bag was empty.

284
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:46,750
特別行動隊清了場 他們只找到了這個
Ops cleaned the site. All they found was this.

285
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:49,660
這是假的
It's a fake.

286
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,080
里邊到底發生了什么事
What happened in there?

287
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:55,450
她在里邊嗎
Is she in there?

288
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,910
納迪亞 你在里邊嗎
Nadia, are you in there?

289
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:04,950
你覺得是我拿走了
You think I took it?

290
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:09,580
- 你要藏在鏡子后面嗎  - 坐下 塞萊斯特
You're gonna hide behind a mirror? Sit down, Celeste.

291
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:12,910
經歷了這么多事之后 你居然覺得是我拿的
After everything?! You think I'd do that?

292
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:14,290
去你媽的
Fuck you!

293
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,580
納迪亞 你能聽到嗎
Do you hear me, Nadia?

294
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:21,250
你當初就不應該讓我加入
You never should have brought me on.

295
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:30,730
過去三個月 你錯過了每一個接頭地點
For the last three months you've missed every one of your Live Drops.

296
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:33,270
是你違反協定在先
You were the one who broke protocol, Mason.

297
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:35,230
我還沒有準備好 你就派了特別行動隊
Sent an ops team before I was ready.

298
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:36,850
是你沒給我選擇的余地
You didn't give me a choice, did you?

299
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:39,980
你失聯了好幾周 我們不確定你是否還活著
You went dark for weeks. We didn't know if you were dead.

300
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:42,350
- 戴維克在哪  - 我把他安置在了地下室
- Where is Davik? - I secured him in the basement.

301
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:44,600
- 他不在地下室 - 我就是把他放在那里了
He wasn't there. That is where I left him.

302
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:48,160
你周圍的各種人和各種物件都不見了
People and things just disappearing around you left and right?

303
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,250
去死吧
Go to hell.

304
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:53,500
好吧
Okay.

305
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,750
那我們聊聊大衛
Let's talk about David.

306
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,450
我兄弟跟這有什么關系
What does my brother got to do with any of this?

307
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:06,650
八歲時 你繼父向你揮舞滾燙的熨斗 是你兄弟擋在了面前
At eight years old, he stepped in front of your stepdad swinging a hot iron at you.

308
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:10,060
是他挨打了 所以你幸免于難 那一次把他打得夠嗆
He took all the beatings so you didn't have to. And it fucked him up.

309
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:11,410
你想說什么
Where's this going?

310
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:15,350
我理解你一定深感愧疚
I understand the guilt you must have felt.

311
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:18,080
他為了保護你做了很大的犧牲
He sacrificed so much to protect you.

312
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:22,330
后來 在你繼父對他的各種行徑之后 你實在無力挽回他
Then after all your stepdad did to him, you couldn't fix him.

313
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:26,400
但你賣掉奧茲鑰匙 就能借此保全大衛的性命
But you sell the Oz Key and you can save his life,

314
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:28,370
支付他頭頂的賞金
pay the bounty on his head.

315
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:30,370
去你的 梅森
Fuck you, Mason.

316
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:40,080
你認識這棟樓嗎
You recognize this building?

317
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:42,950
放大8C單元
Zoom in to unit 8C.

318
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,080
那是誰
Who is that?

319
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:54,600
梅森 我兄弟 跟這件事一點關系都沒有
Mason, my brother has nothing to do with this.

320
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,650
但他卻處處跟你有關系
But he has everything to do with you.

321
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,650
你每周給他打一次電話 每個月給他寄八百美元
You call him once a week. You send him $800 a month.

322
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:03,270
即使在創業孵化器毫無收獲時 你也用了自己的積蓄給他付錢
Even when you were at the Incubator making nothing, you paid him out of your savings.

323
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:05,750
- 你兄弟是個廢人 - 閉嘴
Your brother seems like a fuckup to me. Shut up.

324
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:07,700
戰術小隊 武裝系統
Tac Unit, arm system.

325
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,080
系統已武裝
System armed.

326
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:12,350
- 住手 - 告訴我奧茲鑰匙在哪
- Stop. - Tell me where the Oz Key is.

327
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:13,940
我他媽真不知道
I don't know, I really don't fucking know.

328
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:17,120
你說你和兄弟關系很好 你倆間隔38秒先后出生 對嗎
You said you and your brother were close. What, 38 seconds apart?

329
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:19,350
- 鎖定目標 - 住手
Tac Unit, acquire target. Stop.

330
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:20,700
目標已鎖定
Target acquired.

331
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,600
你為了他而賣了奧茲鑰匙 不是嗎
You sold it for him, didn't you?

332
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:25,690
承認吧
Admit it.

333
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:27,310
- 買家是誰  - 誰也沒有
Who's your buyer? - Nobody.

334
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:28,450
最后一次機會
-- Last chance!

335
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:32,540
- 執… - 夠了
- Tac Unit, exec... - Enough.

336
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:39,480
你覺得你剛才是在干什么
The fuck do you think you were doing?

337
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,060
我沒準備把他干掉
I wasn't actually gonna take him out.

338
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:42,480
但你剛才聽起來是認真的
Oh, yeah? You sounded pretty convincing.

339
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:45,400
- 不能打斷審訊  - 剛才那根本不是審訊
You can't stop an interrogation! That wasn't a fucking interrogation!

340
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:48,060
那是在攻擊我們自己人
That was an assault on one of our own!

341
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:50,440
塞萊斯特沒拿奧茲鑰匙
Celeste didn't take the Oz Key.

342
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,230
她說把奧茲鑰匙藏在了應急響應包里 戴維克發現后拿走了
She said she hid it in her go bag. Davik had to have found the bag and taken it.

343
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:57,270
那是他在地下室被反綁的時候 還是從后門逃走的時候拿走的
When? When he was tied up in the basement? Or when he fled out the back?

344
00:22:57,470 --> 00:23:00,520
你問問塞萊斯特 再問問特別行動隊 回答完全是兩個故事
You ask Celeste, you ask Ops, you get two different fucking stories.

345
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,400
我認識她五年了
I've known her for five years, Mason.

346
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:04,910
我比這里的任何人都了解她
I know her better than anyone here.

347
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:07,700
她沒拿
She didn't take it.

348
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,690
現在戴維克知道了她是臥底
And now Davik knows that she was undercover.

349
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:15,540
戴維克視她為累贅 所以會來追殺她的
She's a liability to him, and he's gonna come after her.

350
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,870
- 她說得對 - 我們得讓她脫身 格雷斯
She's right. We have to get her out, Grace.

351
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:24,400
她最好的選擇 就是被轉移到一個獨立的安全屋
Her best option is to relocate her to an unaffiliated safe house.

352
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:26,770
我可以聯絡一些軍情六處的聯系人
I can reach out to some MI6 contacts.

353
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:28,040
那是必須的
It'll have to do.

354
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:33,450
安德斯醒了 你們應該去審審他
Anders is awake. You should interview him.

355
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,000
我去吧
I'll do it.

356
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:44,330
別告訴我你們相信塞萊斯特
Do not tell me you believe Celeste.

357
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:46,020
納迪亞信她
Nadia does.

358
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:48,660
她救過納迪亞的命 納迪亞當然信她了
She saved Nadia's life. Of course she does.

359
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:51,020
塞萊斯特拿到了奧茲鑰匙
Celeste had the Oz Key.

360
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:53,100
她失聯了三個月
She went dark for three months.

361
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,580
然后鑰匙就消失了
Then it disappears?

362
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,350
她耍了我們所有人
I mean, come on, she's working all of us.

363
00:23:56,550 --> 00:23:59,150
無論是堡壘 安德斯還是戴維克 她需要誰就為誰賣命
Citadel, Anders and Davik, anyone she needs to to make a buck

364
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:03,350
就為了賺錢給自己兄弟還債 救他的性命
for herself so she can pay off her brother's debt and save his life.

365
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:04,650
那我們該怎么辦
So what do we do?

366
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:06,790
我們向指揮部提出詢問
We open an inquiry with Command.

367
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:10,040
我們對她啟用后盾
We backstop her.

368
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:12,520
梅森
Mason.

369
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,060
我們不能就這樣刪除她的記憶
We can't just erase her memory.

370
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:16,540
她可是一級行動員 格雷斯
She's Tier-One, Grace.

371
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:20,600
她掌握堡壘的一切 你要讓她這樣回到現實中去嗎
She knows everything about Citadel. You gonna let her out in the world with that information?

372
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,810
她會把我們出賣給出價最高的人
She'll sell us out to the highest bidder.

373
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:24,600
我們必須清除她的記憶
- We have to wipe her clean.

374
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:27,810
指揮部甚至都還沒有批準 后盾的安全流程
- Command hasn't even approved Backstop's safety procedures yet.

375
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:28,940
這技術太新了
It's too new.

376
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:31,560
你光是提出這個建議 我就能對你施加懲罰
I could have you sanctioned for even suggesting something like that.

377
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:35,250
在你擔任主管期間 內奸搞垮了堡壘 你想被貼上這個標簽嗎
You want to be known as the director who let a mole take down the agency?

378
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:41,660
我無法授權啟用后盾
I can't authorize the backstop.

379
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:44,900
不需要你授權
You don't have to.

380
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:46,660
我們可以換個地方執行
We'd do it off-site.

381
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:49,190
不需要讓任何人知道
No one needs to know.

382
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:52,310
瞞著納迪亞 瞞著指揮部 瞞著所有人
Not Nadia. Not Command. No one.

383
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:53,700
我會處理好的
I'll take care of it.

384
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:58,810
如果最后能證明她的話是真的 我們再把她帶回來
Look, if what she says turns out to be true,

385
00:24:59,010 --> 00:25:01,200
重新激活她的記憶 就好像什么事都沒發生過一樣
we'll bring her back, reactivate her memories like nothing happened.

386
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,270
如果是她干的呢
And what if she did it?

387
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:05,520
那就讓她處于 被啟用后盾的狀態 讓她坐牢
Then she stays backstopped. Goes to prison.

388
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,450
這樣一來 堡壘的機密是安全的
But Citadel's secrets are safe.

389
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:19,160
我們要怎么跟她說
What are we gonna tell her?

390
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:29,810
- 把這個戴上 - 這是什么
I'm gonna need you to put this on. - What the hell is that?

391
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:32,440
能停用你的ARC芯片 以及你在堡壘的所有證明
- It deactivates your ARC chip and the rest of your Citadel creds.

392
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,900
- 為什么要停用  - 我們要帶你離開這里
Why would I want that? We're getting you out of here.

393
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:38,190
戴維克知道你是誰 他會來追殺你和你兄弟的
Davik knows who you are. He's gonna come after you and your brother.

394
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:40,310
我們要把你轉移至安全屋
We're gonna relocate you to a safe house.

395
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:41,310
安全屋
A safe house?

396
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:42,520
回頭再細說 眼下來說…
There'll be time to talk later. For now...

397
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,440
他肯定能找到安全屋的位置
You don't think he'll be able to sniff out a safe house?

398
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,270
你們能找到我兄弟 他肯定也能找到
You were able to find my brother. Think about how easy it will be for them to do the same.

399
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:48,480
那你的建議是什么
-Then what do you suggest?

400
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:51,560
我不知道 但你迅速提醒了所有人 這次是你的行動
I don't know, Mason. But you're real quick to remind everyone this is your op.

401
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:55,790
既然是你的行動搞砸了 那你何不自己想辦法呢
Well, your op turned into a clusterfuck. So why don't you figure it out.

402
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:02,250
還有一個選項
There is another option.

403
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:05,350
這是一個即將推出的新程序
It's a new program soon to be rolled out.

404
00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:08,560
適用于處境極為不利的一級行動員
Meant for Tier-One Operators in a worst-case scenario.

405
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,730
能確保他們消失
If, for whatever reason, they have to disappear.

406
00:26:10,930 --> 00:26:14,350
你將被帶到墨西哥城的一個設施 在那里被注射鎮靜劑
You'll be taken to a facility in Mexico City. You'd be sedated.

407
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:17,310
在鎮靜期間 他們會對你進行兩場無痛手術
While you're under, they'll perform a pair of painless procedures

408
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:21,020
重塑你的角膜和指紋脊 幫助你隱姓埋名
to reshape your cornea and the ridges of your fingerprints to help you hide.

409
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:23,540
你以后就不是塞萊斯特格雷厄姆了 而會是另一個人
You won't be Celeste Graham anymore. You'll be someone else.

410
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,290
會變成戴維克永遠找不到的人
Someone that Davik can never find.

411
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,790
所以這算是證人轉移
So it's Witness Relocation?

412
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,540
沒錯 你和你兄弟都是如此
That's right. For you and your brother.

413
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:38,580
塵埃落定之后 我可以回歸我的生活嗎
And when the dust settles, I can just get back to my life?

414
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:41,450
這是保護你的最佳方式
It's the best way to protect you.

415
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:46,660
那我們就這么辦吧
Let's do it.

416
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:49,120
把她藏起來 直到我們可以撤離
Keep her hidden till we can evac.

417
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:57,580
我們不能把真相告訴納迪亞
We can't tell Nadia the truth.

418
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:12,830
搞定了嗎
Is it done?

419
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:14,540
重新安置好她了嗎
She resettled?

420
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:17,330
我親自打的電話
I made the call myself.

421
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:19,660
她正在前往安全屋的途中
She's on route to the safe house.

422
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:22,830
格雷斯 謝謝你做的一切
Thank you, Grace, for everything.

423
00:27:23,290 --> 00:27:24,500
先別著急謝我
Don't thank me yet.

424
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,660
我們還需要找到奧茲鑰匙
We need to find the Oz Key.

425
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:30,660
是的
Yeah.

426
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:32,790
我們在找了
We're on it.

427
00:27:53,870 --> 00:27:54,790
有眉目嗎
Any luck?

428
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:58,000
還沒有戴維克的跡象 我們還在找
No sign of Davik yet. We're still looking.

429
00:27:58,450 --> 00:28:00,040
你覺得這個怎么樣
What do you think of this one?

430
00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:07,230
很溫馨 很典雅
Uh... Cozy. Classic.

431
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:08,750
這是在俄勒岡州
Yeah, it's in Oregon.

432
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:11,690
我祖母住過的小鎮
Small town my grandmother lived in.

433
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:13,940
你給塞萊斯特 也安排了2點5個孩子嗎
Did you give her 2.5 kids, too?

434
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:16,910
你想憑空捏造生活嗎 隨你便
You want to invent a life out of thin air? Be my guest.

435
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,900
聽我說 如果被指揮部發現了
Look at, um, what happens if Command catches wind

436
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:24,100
你私自啟用后盾程序怎么辦
you back-channeled an unsanctioned Backstop procedure?

437
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:28,190
我可能會逃跑吧 也許我會就此安頓 過上簡單的生活
I'd have to go on the run, I guess. Maybe I'd settle down for the simple life.

438
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:30,020
那我花錢也愿意看
Yeah, I'd pay to see that.

439
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:32,690
經歷過這一天之后  不想想這棟房子嗎
After a day like today, that house?

440
00:28:32,890 --> 00:28:35,290
看看這門廊 還有涼爽的夏日微風
That porch? Cool summer breeze?

441
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:39,410
天啊 你肯定連五分鐘都撐不住
Man, you wouldn't last five minutes.

442
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:45,160
謝謝你還我人情
Thanks for calling in a favor.

443
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:48,040
對 安妮梅希亞 她是個老朋友
Yeah, Ana Mejía, she's an old friend.

444
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:51,540
她用后盾創造出了非常特別的東西
She created something very special with Backstop.

445
00:28:54,370 --> 00:28:56,370
我們需要毀掉塞萊斯特的藥劑
We need to destroy Celeste's vial.

446
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:59,410
永久刪除她的記憶
Erase her memories permanently.

447
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:06,580
梅森 你確定塞萊斯特是內奸嗎
Mason, are you sure that Celeste is a mole?

448
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,000
我知道
I know it.

449
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:10,950
你必須很篤定才行
You have to be certain.

450
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:17,410
因為以前我有一次不是很篤定 后來每天都在后悔
Because one time I wasn't and... I think about it every day.

451
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:19,500
我很篤定
I am certain.

452
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:22,150
這件事開弓沒有回頭箭
You do this, you know there's no going back.

453
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:23,400
我就是要這個效果
That's the point.

454
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:25,080
我不是說她
I'm not talking about her.

455
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,620
我說的是你
I'm talking about you.

456
00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:29,950
加到命令里
Put in the order.

457
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,690
- 聽我說… - 加到命令里
- Listen to me... - Put in the order.

458
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:35,750
聽我說
Listen to me.

459
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:37,850
如果你錯怪了她
If you're wrong about her,

460
00:29:38,050 --> 00:29:41,790
這件事情是不可逆的
this is not something that you can come back from.

461
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:44,160
不可逆
You can't.

462
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:48,950
一名間諜可能有一百個名字 一百張臉 一百個身份
A spy can have a hundred names, a hundred faces, a hundred identities.

463
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:52,290
但靈魂卻只有一個
But you only get one soul.

464
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:59,080
我們要不惜任何代價保護堡壘
We have to protect Citadel at all costs.

465
00:29:59,910 --> 00:30:00,910
這是你告訴我的
You told me that.

466
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:04,370
那誰來保護你呢
Mm-hmm. But who's going to protect you?

467
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,410
不用擔心我
Don't worry about me.

468
00:30:13,410 --> 00:30:16,410
堡壘后盾設施 墨西哥城

469
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:29,700
放松就好…
Just relax and breathe naturally.

470
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:47,080
卡特告訴我 塞萊斯特已經被轉移到了俄勒岡州
Carter told me Celeste has been relocated to Oregon.

471
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:49,540
梅森 謝謝你支持她
Thanks for having her back, Mason.

472
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:53,910
也謝謝你支持我
And mine.

473
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:23,950
你還好嗎
You good?

474
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:25,660
還好
Yep.

475
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:30,660
奧茲鑰匙有消息嗎
Any news on the Oz Key?

476
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:32,750
沒有
Nothing.

477
00:31:37,910 --> 00:31:39,330
不是戴維克拿的
Davik didn't take it.

478
00:31:41,330 --> 00:31:43,580
而且你認為也不是塞萊斯特拿的
And you don't think Celeste was the one that took it either.

479
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:45,700
什么意思
Excuse me?

480
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:50,480
我是唯一能夠訪問 堡壘所有加密通信的人
I am the only one with access to all of Citadel's encrypted communications.

481
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,660
那是我的工作
That's my job.

482
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:54,080
這你是知道的 對吧
You know that, right?

483
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:59,330
兄弟 我認識你十年了
I have known you a decade, brother.

484
00:32:00,290 --> 00:32:02,910
我熟悉你的行為習慣和思維方式
I know your behavior patterns, how you think.

485
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:05,870
你今天的表現很不像你
You acted very out of character today.

486
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:08,790
我們處于危機之中
We were in crisis mode.

487
00:32:09,370 --> 00:32:10,370
那倒是
Right.

488
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:15,290
我一開始沒想到 但我快速查詢了我們的服務器
I didn't think to at first, but I scrubbed our servers.

489
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:19,230
發現有位一級特工向特別行動隊隊長 秘密發送了一條指令
And I found that a cloaked order was given to the chief of the ops team by a Tier-One agent in secret.

490
00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:23,910
而這條命令是違反協議的
And against protocol.

491
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:29,230
那位一級特工命令特別行動隊隊長 把奧茲鑰匙藏起來
That Tier-One ordered the chief to conceal the Oz Key

492
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:31,480
并在回來后交給他們
and deliver it to them on their return.

493
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:35,040
- 我知道你知道那個特工是誰 - 別說了 卡特
And I know you know who that agent was. Stop there, Carter.

494
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:40,450
那條秘密指令是納迪亞下的
Nadia gave the cloaked order.

495
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,190
你說過你對塞萊斯特啟用了后盾
You said that you backstopped Celeste

496
00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:49,440
這樣她就不能泄露堡壘的任何秘密
so she couldn't give up any Citadel secrets,

497
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,200
但我認為你那樣做
but I think you did

498
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,080
是為了阻止我們發現她沒有罪證
that to stop us from finding out that she didn't have any.

499
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,330
阻止我們發現她是無辜的
She was clean.

500
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:02,400
你為了讓塞萊斯特代人受罪 所以一直對她假意懷疑
You needed to keep suspicion on Celeste to have her take the fall.

501
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:05,560
這樣一來你就能對她啟用后盾 抹去她的記憶
So you backstopped her, erased her memories.

502
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,690
并不是因為她對堡壘構成了威脅
Not because she was a threat to Citadel,

503
00:33:07,890 --> 00:33:09,650
而是因為她會對納迪亞構成威脅
But because she would be a threat to Nadia.

504
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:12,750
因為你是在保護納迪亞
Because you are protecting Nadia.

505
00:33:19,410 --> 00:33:21,290
因為雖然你很愛她…
Because even though you love her...

506
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:27,250
但你認為她可能是內奸
...you think Nadia might be a mole.

507
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,620
這些話你永遠不要再提
Don't you ever say those words again.

508
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:45,120
就是你干的
You-you did this.

509
00:33:46,450 --> 00:33:47,540
我干了什么
What did I do?

510
00:33:48,370 --> 00:33:49,370
不是你
Not you.

511
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:52,660
是她
Her.

512
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,370
你不能相信她
You can't trust her.

513
00:34:10,950 --> 00:34:12,020
為什么不行
Why not?

514
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:13,270
納迪亞
Nadia?

515
00:34:13,470 --> 00:34:14,770
《堡壘》下集精彩看點

516
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:17,440
你殺了數千名特工
You killed thousands of agents.

517
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:18,940
功勞不能都歸我一人
I can't take all the credit.

518
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:21,790
一位堡壘的特工背叛了你們所有人
A Citadel spy betrayed you all.

519
00:34:24,330 --> 00:34:25,910
我已經不知道你是誰了
I don't know who you are anymore.

520
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:30,600
我們都沒有自己想象的那么清白 這你是知道的
None of us are as clean as we want to be. And you know that.

521
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,250
我想知道真相
You want to know the truth?

522
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:38,160
