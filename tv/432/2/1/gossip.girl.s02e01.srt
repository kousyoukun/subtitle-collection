1
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:14,600
Someone saw serena getting off a train at grand central.

2
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,000
52 WEEKS

3
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:18,300
I thought everything was good between us.

4
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:21,300
It was... before I found out you had sex with my boyfriend.

5
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:26,030
The best friend and the boyfriend-- that's pretty classy, s.

6
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,000
365 DAYS

7
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,000
You'd really go out with some guy you don't know?

8
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:31,900
Well, he can't be worse than the guys I do know.

9
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:33,900
Well, our kids were bound to meet. it's a small island.

10
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:36,060
Are you sure it's not some ploy you're using to get to me?

11
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:37,800
A WHOLE SEASON OF INTRIGUE

12
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:45,150
Did you sleep with her, huh?

13
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,910
I know how long you and I have been best friends, okay?

14
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,870
No, it's not okay, chuck. from now on, you stay away from me.

15
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:52,560
Did something happen last night? yes.

16
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:57,250
I'm done. I lied, and I stole, and I lost the respect of my family...

17
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:58,060
For what?

18
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:00,720
I tried to warn you. there's a price to pay.

19
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:03,780
Lily, would you do me the honor of being my wife?

20
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:06,930
He proposed before we left, and I'm going to say yes.

21
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:10,330
One thing I learned-- that in the face of true love,

22
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:11,820
You don't just give up,

23
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:14,570
Even if the object of your affection is begging you to.

24
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:17,630
I'm not who you thought I was, and you can't forgive that.

25
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,050
I don't know how to make things go back to what they were.

26
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:22,380
I'm locking myself away in the hamptons.

27
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:24,660
You know how I get in the summer. yeah, I do.

28
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:27,120
If you want to reflect together, I'll be around.

29
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:29,060
THE STORY CONTINUES

30
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,380
And who am i?

31
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:35,090
That's a secret I'll never tell.

32
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:37,620
You know you love me.

33
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:41,370
X.o.x.o., gossip girl.

34
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:51,640
Unlike the rest of us, sex, lies and scandal never take a vacation.

35
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:52,480
Instead,

36
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:56,790
They take the long island expressway and head east to the hamptons.

37
00:01:57,010 --> 00:02:00,600
Some would say summer is their busiest season.

38
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:11,110
Think park avenue, but with tennis whites and bain de soleil.

39
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:14,720
The players change, but the game remains the same.

40
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:22,210
I've been waiting for this all day.

41
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:25,930
Mmm. are you sure serena's still okay with covering for you?

42
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:28,590
She was a little cold. oh, she's totally fine.

43
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,840
Mmm. but you haven't told her anything?

44
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:33,940
All she knows is that I'm seeing someone 

45
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:36,350
I'm not ready to introduce to anyone just yet.

46
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,020
Or ever.

47
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:43,770
Look, she needed time to decompress from her breakup anyway.

48
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:46,600
Covering for me works for her, too.

49
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:57,460
Let's go to my place before somebody spots us.

50
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:58,730
Your house?

51
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,720
I thought we couldn't.

52
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,250
There's always the guesthouse.

53
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:14,300
Girls,

54
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:15,500
You don't know how thankful I am to have 

55
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:18,560
Finally found a use for geometry in my daily life.

56
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:24,420
Yes.

57
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:32,720
Spotted--blair waldorf at charles de gaulle homeward bound.

58
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:35,910
What could possibly make queen b.

59
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,000
Abandon her two dads before labor day?

60
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:42,190
We bet chuck bass wants to know. mr. chuck?

61
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,760
Is there something you need care taking of?

62
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:48,730
The only thing I need to take care of is you...

63
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:51,720
And you...

64
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:54,180
And you.

65
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:59,710
Also spotted-- serena van der woodsen on cooper's beach...

66
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,600
Alone again.

67
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:10,320
We've heard talk that things are heating up with nate archibald.

68
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:13,600
And where there's smoke, there's usually fire.

69
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:15,230
But if that's the case,

70
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:19,450
Why has nate fallen right off our radar and serena, as always,

71
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:20,980
Sighted solo?

72
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,500
Wonder what she'd do if she knew lonely boy wasn't so lonely anymore.

73
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:32,080
You know, i-i've been harris' assistant all summer.

74
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:33,780
How come I don't know you?

75
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:36,710
I was at his symposium at the 92nd street y in june.

76
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,990
No way. no, if you were there, we would have met.

77
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,490
"...and dish up justice.

78
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:45,370
"you considered violence and you considered reconciliation."

79
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:47,030
How about now...

80
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:50,700
We can meet whenever you want?

81
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:02,510
I had my eye on her.

82
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:05,640
I-i don't think she noticed, sir. I read from your favorite chapter.

83
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:07,190
Or did you not notice?

84
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,030
Uh, you know, I've heard that chapter so many times,

85
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,630
Sometimes I think I wrote it myself.

86
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,250
Speaking of, where is that story of yours?

87
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:19,110
You know, the one your internship requires you turn in?

88
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,750
Yeah, it's, uh, it's imminent. so is death. be more specific.

89
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:26,540
I-i'm just doing a polish.it's basi noah shapiro at the "paris review"

90
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:28,230
Is looking forward to it.

91
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,680
And calling him was an amazing thing to do for me.

92
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:30,890
Really, thank you.

93
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:35,590
I told him it would be even better than your piece in the "new yorker."

94
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,560
Don't let me down.

95
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:38,450
Oh, it'll be on your desk first thing in the morning, sir.

96
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:40,330
Why don't you go home and finish now?

97
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:45,210
Hey! where have you been hiding? hey.

98
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,570
Thought you asked me to meet you here.

99
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:48,770
You know what? unfortunately, i-i-i have to go.

100
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:50,380
Rain check for tomorrow?

101
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:53,560
I'll make it up. I promise. okay.

102
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:56,220
Well, well, well, lonely boy.

103
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:59,860
Maybe dating and dumping serena wasn't such a bad idea.

104
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:02,160
Looks like it's time to give you a new nickname.

105
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:04,000
How about "playboy"?

106
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:05,820
People, people, I'm worried.

107
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:09,380
Eleanor returns next week, and we are still behind.

108
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:11,930
Now since I have to go to that party this weekend, I won't be around,

109
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:13,220
And therefore, neither will you,

110
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:17,600
So you better get twice as much work done today, or you will regret it.

111
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:22,180
As for little j., looks like this summer has been all work and no play.

112
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:23,870
You can't be finished.

113
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,040
There's no way you could possibly be finished.

114
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:29,160
Don't you do anything when you leave here, ginny?

115
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:30,560
Um, actually,

116
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:32,710
I was hoping I could show you something I've been working on.

117
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,830
This isn't school. I don't look at your work.

118
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:41,560
I was an intern once, too. it gets better.

119
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:44,640
What is that?

120
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:47,840
Oh, it's a dress I made for the white party. for the vitamin water party?

121
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:51,320
Mm-hmm. who invited you? oh, lace?

122
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:54,370
Ugh! it's not even white. it's bone.

123
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,880
It's way too big for you. don't you know how to fit?

124
00:06:57,890 --> 00:07:01,280
It's huge. well, it's not actually for me. it's for you.

125
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:03,770
Um, I'm not going to the party, so...

126
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:08,650
So you thought I might wear some holly hobbie frock made by an 

127
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:12,560
Intern so that when I get photographed, your work ends up in "w"?

128
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,870
If I'm gonna wear a custom anything, it's gonna matter.

129
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,700
Here's what you asked for, laurel.

130
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:22,290
Since you did so well with repairing the trim on the dead stock,

131
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,020
Match these up.

132
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:28,230
Oh, and put that away. eggshell gives me a migraine.

133
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:38,330
Well, I guess now's as good a time as any to order dinner.

134
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:40,700
What do you want? indian? oh, it's too hot for indian.

135
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,210
How about popsicles?

136
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:43,350
Hey. where's mom?

137
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,350
Oh, she and alex had tickets to "south pacific."

138
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,160
What is that, more homework? finish your story yet?

139
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:49,040
Almost. good.

140
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:50,860
I'm hoping by reading it that maybe I can 

141
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,980
Figure out why you and serena broke up anyway.

142
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:57,570
Yeah.

143
00:07:58,340 --> 00:07:59,620
Yeah, me, too.

144
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:03,360
Hey, jen, I'm gonna head out and get some food.

145
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:04,770
I'll be back in a bit.

146
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:09,800
This is the first time I've seen you look in the mirror all summer.

147
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:12,430
Here I thought if you did, you'd turn to stone.

148
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:13,570
You must be pretty nvous about 

149
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:15,150
Something if you're willing to take that risk.

150
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:18,640
Ha ha, sis. I'm on my way out to lily nd.

151
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:21,030
With the triplets returning toio,

152
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,920
I thought I'd continue my tour of south america.

153
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:25,930
I'm thinking argentina. then what are the flowers for?

154
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:29,380
You wouldn't perhaps have overheard a recent phone call with a certain 

155
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:33,270
Best friend of mine who mentiod she's on her way out here on the jitney?

156
00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:35,170
What's a jitney?

157
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:37,410
If that's your way of saying no, then I'm glad to hear it,

158
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:40,220
'cause blair will never forgive you for what you did to her.

159
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:42,710
Who told you that little piece of advice-- your "boyfriend" nate?

160
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,060
Nate didn't say anything.

161
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:44,740
Good,

162
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:45,730
'cause I don't think it's wise taking 

163
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:48,820
Relationship advice from somebody in a fake relationship.

164
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:50,150
Call me crazy.

165
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:54,590
Enjoy another night alone with your thoughts.

166
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,870
Good luck on your suicide mission.

167
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:08,450
Spotted--chuck bass waiting for the jitney, a dozen roses in one hand,

168
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,550
His heart in the other.

169
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:15,790
You know what they say-- a man is a good thing to come home for,

170
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,840
But an even better thing to come home with.

171
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:30,560
Ain't karma a bitch?

172
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:33,250
We know blair waldorf is.

173
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:48,840
You didn't do anything all summer?

174
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:51,400
Please don't tell me you just sat around watching "the closer"

175
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:53,030
And eating takeout from nick and toni's.

176
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:57,170
No, della femina. what about all those rumors I heard about you and nate?

177
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,340
Mnh-mnh-mnh. completely untrue.

178
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:01,380
They just got people off my back about being sad,

179
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:02,950
And then nate could do whatever he wanted,

180
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,920
So it worked out for both of us.

181
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:05,920
you're telling me you didn't have any fun with anyone all summer?

182
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,920
oh, there was this hot lifeguard that asked me out.

183
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:14,220
But i, you know, i-i turned him down. what? are you crazy?

184
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:17,200
A hot lifeguard is like kleenex-- use once and throw away.

185
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:19,630
You couldn't ask for a better rebound. I don't think I'm ready.

186
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,310
I-i still miss dan sometimes...

187
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,570
More than sometimes... all the time.

188
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:27,920
The only thing lamer than dating dan humphrey is mourning dan humphrey.

189
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,940
And the only reason you're still sitting shivah is because 

190
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:32,400
You haven't gotten back out there and had your summer fling.

191
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:34,060
Yeah, the triplets esquerda'd,

192
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:37,620
But not before teaching me some portuguese tongue twisters.

193
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:39,260
I'll seea.

194
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:42,610
James is the classiest guy I've ever met, you know?

195
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:45,700
He drinks gin martinis, and he speaks six languages,

196
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:49,170
And he gave me this amazing bulgari 

197
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:51,390
Pearl choker with a gold "b" clasp on it.

198
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:55,100
Wait, I thought your dad gave you that. who's james?

199
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,760
Oh, my god, b.

200
00:10:57,770 --> 00:10:59,400
He sounds amazing.

201
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:03,450
The last time we talked, um... you hadn't even met him.

202
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:06,150
Oh, I know! he swept me off my feet.

203
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,200
He's so charming. plus, he tells the best stories.

204
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:10,570
You're lying.

205
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:11,350
I am not.

206
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,810
Your eyes are doing that thing where they don't match your mouth.

207
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:15,790
I wasn't aware that robots got jealous.

208
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,710
Did they update your software while I was away?

209
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,680
Come on.

210
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:20,930
You and I both know this guy's just a prop you bought 

211
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:24,580
To try to hurt me like I hurt you. you didn't hurt me.

212
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:30,290
Well, I will admit,

213
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:34,570
Waiting for you in tuscany the first few days were mildly humiliating.

214
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:37,160
But when I realized you weren't gonna show, I rallied.

215
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:39,540
Luckily, I made a friend on the trip over.

216
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:42,040
Boring ben-- my dad's ex-employee?

217
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:43,700
By the way, I had him fired just for you.

218
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:47,010
Well, I owe him everything. he introduced me to james.

219
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,990
You know, I think he might be the one.

220
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,370
Prove it. I don't have to prove anything.

221
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,710
But if you want to get to know james better,

222
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,380
I'll bring him to dinner tonight.

223
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:57,350
I'll bet you'll like him just as much as I do.

224
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,650
Oh, and if by that you mean I won't like him at all, then you're right.

225
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:03,130
I'll see you at 7:00.

226
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:09,460
Now how about we go find that lifeguard?

227
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:12,090
But we have to stop at nate's first.

228
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,870
He has something of mine that I need.

229
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:19,230
Hey. how's vermont?

230
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:22,270
Great. vanessa and her parents were at last night's gig.

231
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,350
I didn't even know she was up here.

232
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,080
When I asked her how dan was doing, she didn't answer.

233
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:29,380
I had hoped maybe that she could help him get over serena this summer.

234
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:31,430
I don't think dan needs any help in that department,

235
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,200
And I think vanessa noticed. is he still dating up a storm?

236
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:38,090
Well, if you call a different girl every night "dating."

237
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,320
I'm a little worried about him, dad.

238
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:43,060
Is he there? he's still sleeping. he was out pretty late last night.

239
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:44,440
Have him call me when he wakes up.

240
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:46,380
Hey, you know, you haven't told me how the dress went over.

241
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:47,820
Yeah, it's over.

242
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:50,090
Uh, laurel doesn't want to wear it to the party.

243
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,270
Well, why don't you wear it?

244
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,030
Dad,

245
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:55,160
As nice as it is that you're encouraging me to get my designs out there,

246
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:57,170
The white party's, like, super exclusive.

247
00:12:57,170 --> 00:12:58,600
I mean, summer interns do not get to go.

248
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:00,930
Last year, they even turned away jack johnson.

249
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:03,150
Sounds like a party with taste. dad!

250
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,930
Also sounds like the kind of party the van der woodsens would go to.

251
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:06,950
Have you asked eric about it?

252
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:09,640
Yeah, that might be a little awkward,

253
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:11,360
Considering the last conversation we had.

254
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:13,500
I sort of said some things I shouldn't have.

255
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:15,510
You know, maybe I should have just come with you this summer.

256
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,520
Eleanor's been in paris, like, the entire time,

257
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:20,060
And laurel's been so worried about everything.

258
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:23,740
What if it was a waste? it's not a waste if there's time to change it.

259
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:27,150
Maybe you should start with eric and then go from there.

260
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:30,010
Thanks, dad. see you sunday? you know it.

261
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:31,260
Okay, bye.

262
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:40,850
Not today, kid.

263
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:43,460
It's all right, joe. he's with me.

264
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,120
M sorry to interrupt you while you're working.

265
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:48,430
You wouldn't be interrupting if you'd shown up on time.

266
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,460
Something tells me you're here empty-handed.

267
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:52,920
All I need is, uh, one--one more day.

268
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:55,480
What, the last 60 weren't good enough?

269
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:58,000
I'm sorry, sir, but i-i-- don't sit. you're not staying.

270
00:13:58,010 --> 00:14:03,280
You told me you were serious about writing. i-i know. I tried to write.

271
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:04,050
I did.

272
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:06,930
But every time I sat down, it's just, there was something in the way.

273
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:07,570
I couldn't focus.

274
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:11,160
Excuses are for the unemployed, of which you are now one.

275
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:12,860
If you won't do your homework, then neither will i.

276
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:15,200
You'll get no letter of recommendation from me.

277
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:17,400
W-working for you is very important to me.

278
00:14:17,971 --> 00:14:20,471
And any of your action illustrated only the opposite

279
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:21,880
Drop my spare key in the mail.

280
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:24,020
That I'm sure you have time to do.

281
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:41,270
If it's apology time, you're about three months late.

282
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,740
Eric, wait-- and let me guess. you want something.

283
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,490
Yeah, you're right.

284
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:48,720
Um, does it help that the new me just answered that honestly?

285
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:49,990
Not really.

286
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:56,270
Look... I know I acted like a complete and total raging bitch last year.

287
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:59,630
But what you don't know is how bad I felt about it all summer.

288
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,770
You were the only person that was friends with me for me,

289
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:03,580
And I hurt you the wor.

290
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:08,260
Well, you did get yours in the end.

291
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:12,190
And since it's not like I have many fries myself,

292
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:16,210
I guess I could use ery lying, manipulating, backstabbing one I can get.

293
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:17,730
What'd you have in mind?

294
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:21,020
Well, do you happen to be in the hamptons right now?

295
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,120
Ooh. a honk instead of a knock. did someone order a townie?

296
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:29,850
Oh, god.

297
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:31,140
The lifeguard's got a camaro,

298
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:33,570
And not in an ironic "i've got a camaro" way.

299
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:36,000
Just go already. luck?

300
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:37,800
Yeah. you, too. mwah.

301
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:40,060
Hey, and if anybody asks, I'm out with nate, okay?

302
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:42,540
I still don't understand what that's about, but okay.

303
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:45,540
Where is he tonight anyway? I don't know. bye.

304
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,700
I'm sorry I couldn't see you all day. it just got away from me.

305
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:52,900
Oh, god. I wish the summer wasn't ending.

306
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,180
I forgot how much fun it is.

307
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:56,690
Well, lots of people have affairs that last year-round.

308
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,710
Yeah, but I can't get caught.

309
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:02,320
I can be really sneaky.

310
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:04,650
Sneaky is cute at your age.

311
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:07,070
A couple decades later, not so much.

312
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:10,720
Mmm. can we talk about this later?

313
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:13,580
If I'm so cute, let's talk about this now.

314
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:18,510
Why don't I do something that shuts you up?

315
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:25,590
So, james, did you have a chance to meet harold and, uh...

316
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,480
What is his boyfriend's name again?

317
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:29,420
Uh, roman? only briefly at the chateau.

318
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:33,470
Although cat didn't seem to like me nearly as much.

319
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:35,060
I ve the scars to prove it.

320
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:38,680
You certainly have crammed an awful lot into such a short time together.

321
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:39,520
I wonder,

322
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:42,420
Has blair had a chance to share her favorite movies with you yet?

323
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:48,030
"tiffany's," "roman holiday," and of course, "charade."

324
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:49,620
Oh, I thought your third favorite was "funny face."

325
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:52,580
It is. I hate "charade." chuck, stop harassing him.

326
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:54,620
Yeah, uh, "how well do you know blair waldorf?"

327
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:56,780
Is kinda boring for those of us who actually know blair waldorf.

328
00:16:56,790 --> 00:17:00,350
Not to mention transparent. well, thank you, grandma.

329
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:03,670
Why is it when you say that word it sounds like an insult?

330
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,580
No, no, i-i don't mind.

331
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:08,080
I would like to learn as much as I can about blair,

332
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:11,690
And there's no better way to learn than through a quiz.

333
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:14,800
Well, it's a shame you guys took a bus and not a limo.

334
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:18,060
I don't know if you know this, but blair loves a limo-- sweetie,

335
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:20,020
Will you please pass me the salt and pepper?

336
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:30,570
, excuse me.

337
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,310
I think I just lost my appetite.

338
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:39,980
Will you excuse me?

339
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:49,890
Chuck.

340
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,880
Look, I know what that pin means to you.

341
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:05,830
You gave it to nate the first time you said you loved him.

342
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,730
Well, I asked for it back.

343
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:10,400
I thought james should have it now.

344
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,620
Do you, uh...

345
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:20,110
Really feel the same way about him as you did nate?

346
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,210
I do.

347
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,400
I'll see you at school.

348
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:53,910
Oh, my goodness.

349
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:57,040
My pin must have gotten caught on your sweater by mistake.

350
00:18:57,450 --> 00:18:59,450
Oh, wow. I didn't feel anything.

351
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:00,800
Neither did i.

352
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:23,340
Well, nathaniel, you have a choice-- under the bed or out the window.

353
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:24,670
What?

354
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,940
My husband just pulled up. your husband?

355
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:28,920
I thought he wasn't supposed to be home till next week.

356
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:30,620
Seems he's home early.

357
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:45,800
Whoa. nate?

358
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:55,830
What the hell's his deal? I have no idea.

359
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:06,780
Damn that mother-chucker.

360
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:09,830
Ugh! he--he's totally right. I don't even like james.

361
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,920
Thank you. I was waiting for that.

362
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:14,270
I only hooked up with him a week ago because 

363
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,360
I knew that I couldn't get off the plane alone.

364
00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:19,030
And it would kill me if chuck knew that he'd ruined my summer.

365
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,530
Oh, b., I'm so sorry.

366
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:25,350
Was it really bad? I would be in my cabana at the h and there he would be.

367
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,300
Amid all the fireworks on bastille day,

368
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:30,480
All I could see was that chuck bass-tard.

369
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:32,110
The limo's taking me back in an hour.

370
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:34,670
You're welcome to join me. dude, you're not going to the white party?

371
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,560
Come on. pretty girls, white dresses.

372
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:39,210
Unless there's a sprinkler, I don't care.

373
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:43,390
Besides, it's tourist season in the city. easy pickings. ah.

374
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:48,270
Okay, and I don't want blair throwing her callboy in my face.

375
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:51,110
At least I could have gotten a more interesting stand-in than james.

376
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,640
Do you know how hard it is to find a good fake boyfriend on short notice?

377
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:58,380
Well, he was smart and fun at tea yesterday, and he's really cute, too.

378
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:01,900
You don't have to lie anymore, serena. he served his purpose.

379
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:04,150
Now that chuck is on his way back to the city,

380
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:07,000
I can dump james just in time to go to the white party stag.

381
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,770
How was your date, by the way?

382
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:12,000
After a few hours with that guy, I needed life saving, not guarding.

383
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:17,410
Babysteps, mach by the way, archibald, now that the summer's over,

384
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:18,940
I can tell you I never believed any 

385
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:20,800
Of the talk that you hit it with my sis.

386
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:24,410
Good morning, waldorf.

387
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:27,480
It was until now nate, why didn't you call me back this morning?

388
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,220
I can't talk about that here.

389
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:32,190
So where's princeton? I'm surprised you let him get away.

390
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:35,140
James goes to georgetown, and unlike you,

391
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:36,950
I don't lose something if I let it out of my sight.

392
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,020
When you told me you secret girlfriend was older,

393
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:40,140
I thought you meant coege.

394
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:41,650
Not to mention, catherine's married.

395
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:45,410
I don't know where you've been, but your boy toy is a princeton man.

396
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:48,290
He and I talked about it while you played dress up with serena last night.

397
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:49,950
Catherine ended it with me last night.

398
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:52,100
What? tell me. you misheard, chuck.

399
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:55,930
He's always going on and on about his crew division and his eating club.

400
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:57,300
It's georgetown all the way.

401
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:59,360
I know he said princeton.

402
00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:00,290
Georgetown. princeton.

403
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:03,900
Georgetown. serena, let's go.

404
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:06,360
Well, I'm glad to hear you're not seeing catherine anymore.

405
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:08,180
We can talk about it later.

406
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:14,230
Eric, it's me. you were at dinner last night.

407
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,310
What college does blair's consort go to?

408
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:19,390
Yeah, well, that's not what he told bla.

409
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:22,430
Do some research, junior. I'm in the mood to be right.

410
00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:29,520
I can't believe that I get a job workg for my literary idol,

411
00:22:29,530 --> 00:22:31,820
And he--and he cans me, you know?

412
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:34,810
I did everything he asked from picking up his dry cleaning to keeping him 

413
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,510
Sober before noon, which was, believe me,

414
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,720
The hardest thing I've ever done.

415
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:39,850
Harder than finishing that story?

416
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:43,170
I just couldn't write it, dad. i-i-i don't know why.

417
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:46,200
You're talking to a guy who couldn't finish a new song in 12 years.

418
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:47,100
I get it.

419
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:48,440
So what is the story about anyway?

420
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:49,800
The dissolution of a relationship 

421
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:51,550
Between two people from different worlds.

422
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:53,470
Science fiction, huh? yeah.

423
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:56,850
Well, if I can offer some fatherly advice from 300 miles away...

424
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:59,750
I-i haven't finished the story because I haven't 

425
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,570
Dealt with my feelings over the way I ended it with serena.

426
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:05,170
Couldn't have said it better myself, even if you'd let me.

427
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:07,060
I've tried not to think about her all summer.

428
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:08,000
I was afraid if I did,

429
00:23:08,010 --> 00:23:11,160
That I would-- I would see that I made a huge mistake.

430
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:13,590
So I've just been trying to distract myself the best I can.

431
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,280
Well, you've been running all summer.

432
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:18,170
Maybe it's time you stopped, and you turned around and faced it.

433
00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:23,280
So not only did james schiller not go to princeton,

434
00:23:23,290 --> 00:23:24,650
He also didn't go to georgetown.

435
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:27,830
In fact, I couldn't find a record of him at any of the big schools.

436
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:30,910
Since when did you become sherlock holmes?

437
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:34,150
So you think james is-- an untalented mr. ripley?

438
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:39,040
If you want entr there's no easier mark than a wronged woman.

439
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:43,620
It's time to call in the big guns.

440
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:49,590
Mike, I need a background check on a james schiller...

441
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,760
He's got a p.i. on speed dial.

442
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:55,100
Nate! I know that face. that face is not your friend.

443
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:57,260
My grandmother just informed me you told her I'm 

444
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:59,190
Gonna be your date to the white party this evening?

445
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:01,210
If things are really over with catherine,

446
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:04,890
Then why do I still need to be your cover? huh?

447
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:07,510
James...

448
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:11,230
The past six days have been exactly what I needed them to be.

449
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:15,800
Me, too. and there's something I've-- me first.

450
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:19,010
Sorry.

451
00:24:26,071 --> 00:24:27,071
Looks like I'll be seeing you and 'princeton' at White Party after all

452
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,690
Oh, what is it? what did you want to say?

453
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:33,860
I just wanted to ask if you'd like to 

454
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:35,290
Come to the white party with me tonight.

455
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:38,700
Sure. that--that'd be great.

456
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:42,900
I know I shouldn't have used you 

457
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:44,800
Again after our conversation this morning.

458
00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:46,850
No, I get it. you have feelings for her.

459
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,630
But let's just be honest about why you want to 

460
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,290
Go tonight-- you wanna check out the competition.

461
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:52,750
No.

462
00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:56,000
I just--i-i wanna see her and her husband together...

463
00:24:56,090 --> 00:24:57,590
Just once.

464
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,960
Yeah, that's called checking out the competition,

465
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:02,940
Which is stupid and potentially dangerous, nate.

466
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:08,510
Yeah, you're right.

467
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:13,140
But since I've been stupid and dangerous in the past, i...

468
00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:15,380
I'm not one to talk, am i?

469
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:19,260
It--it was probably gonna be an uneventful evening anyway.

470
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:22,080
Pick me up at 5:00.

471
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:29,890
Sometimes the stars align for two old friends to come together.

472
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:37,110
But sometimes theylign for two old flames to totallycombust.

473
00:25:37,530 --> 00:25:39,810
Hey, uh, 14 sandpiper lane? yeah, yeah.

474
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:40,710
You go there? all right.

475
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:45,660
Wonder what the sky holds for s. tonight-- friendship or fireworks?

476
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,700
Hey, thanks again for giving me another chance.

477
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:26,580
Thanks for being worthy of it.

478
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:28,030
You know you're on probation, right?

479
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,180
Yeah.

480
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:38,660
I think you guys all look great. I ju-- oh, you look great.

481
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:41,080
Please tell everyone I said hi. all right, bye.

482
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,540
Can you excuse me a moment?

483
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:53,040
Trying to ruin my marriage?

484
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:57,230
Get me drunk?

485
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,450
Absolutely.

486
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,400
Daniel humphrey.

487
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:12,520
I can honestly say I'm surprised.

488
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:13,830
Is--is serena here?

489
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,500
No, she's gone ahead to a party that I'm quite late for myself.

490
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:19,380
Uh, could you... please?

491
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:21,610
Oh--oh, yeah. sure.

492
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,680
Yeah, if you really want me to.

493
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:34,500
There you go.

494
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:35,910
Thank you.

495
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:38,750
Oh, you--you seem, uh...

496
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:40,360
I-i don't know, you seem different.

497
00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:42,330
Well, certain things are in remission, mr.

498
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:45,150
Humphrey, not the least of which is my former attitude.

499
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:47,310
Going through something like I did changes you.

500
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:51,030
You can see things differently. yeah? like, uh, like what?

501
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,830
Like how the keys to someone else's happiness 

502
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:55,950
Are not necessarily the same ones as for your own.

503
00:27:57,310 --> 00:28:00,910
Serena thinks she had me fooled this summer, but I know the truth.

504
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:03,350
You are still in her heart.

505
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,460
Are--are you sure I'm at the right house?

506
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:13,960
This party that you're about to take 

507
00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:16,250
Me to-- it has a very strict dress code.

508
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:23,610
And all of that is to say what I wanted to talk to you about earlier,

509
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:27,520
Is that my feelings for you have deepened, and i...

510
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:31,800
I can't help thinking that what I've done is something so terrible,

511
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:35,500
So inappropriate-- you're so funny! I'm--i'm sorry.

512
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:36,930
I could just listen to you all day.

513
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:39,350
Did i--did I say something funny? mmm.

514
00:28:57,070 --> 00:28:58,600
Hi. vitamin water?

515
00:28:58,670 --> 00:28:59,660
What kind would you like?

516
00:28:59,670 --> 00:29:02,010
Uh, "rescue," please? okay.

517
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:03,300
Make that two.

518
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:04,320
You got it.

519
00:29:04,330 --> 00:29:06,130
So, ginny...

520
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:10,520
How did you manage to get in, and in that dress?

521
00:29:10,530 --> 00:29:13,440
You know, I checked at the door, and your name's not on the list,

522
00:29:13,450 --> 00:29:15,610
And they said you were someone's plus-one.

523
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:19,330
But I told them that someone like you couldn't possibly know anyone here.

524
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:20,220
Oh, look.

525
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:21,970
Actually, here's someone I know coming right now.

526
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:24,960
Jenny, this is tinsley mormer, a friend of my mom's.

527
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,870
Tinsley, this is my friend jenny I told you about.

528
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,380
And that's laurel.

529
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:31,330
It's so nice to meet you, jenny.

530
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:32,970
It's nice to meet you, too.

531
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:37,630
I have a look book of photos from magazines that I cut out, and you're in,

532
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:40,940
Like, all of them. you have amazing taste. that is so sweet. thank you.

533
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:43,290
You know, eric said you're an aspiring designer.

534
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:46,610
Are you wearing one of your own pieces? yeah, as a matter of fact, I am.

535
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:48,330
Is something wrong?

536
00:29:50,610 --> 00:29:52,950
You've been using me to make that guy jealous.

537
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,540
I have not. it's no wonder you hate "charade."

538
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:57,700
It hits too close to home.

539
00:29:57,710 --> 00:30:00,200
You don't understand. chuck is an awful person.

540
00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:02,050
He does terrible things. he uses people.

541
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:05,120
And... you think you're any different?

542
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:08,880
I can't believe I've been so stupid.

543
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:12,030
I bet you don't even like me at all.

544
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:14,640
No, not really.

545
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:16,020
I mean...

546
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:19,100
You're kind of boring.

547
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:20,290
Am i?

548
00:30:20,970 --> 00:30:24,780
Or are you just too interested in yourself to get to know me?

549
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:29,150
You two deserve each other.

550
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:37,000
You really know how to hurt people.

551
00:30:37,010 --> 00:30:40,230
I admire you for it. this is all your fault.

552
00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:41,980
I would have never needed a james if you 

553
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:43,560
Hadn't stood me up at the airport in the first place.

554
00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:46,540
You made me use him. I didn't make you do anything.

555
00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:49,940
You were just you. don't you see? we're the same.

556
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:51,440
Stop trying to fight it.

557
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:54,210
I will fight until my last dying breath,

558
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:57,120
Because any resemblance to you is something I would hate about myself.

559
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:10,490
Playing) come on. cheer up, charlie.

560
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:14,430
What are you still doing here?

561
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:17,430
What did she just say to you?

562
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:20,940
She just asked me what I'm still doing here. oh, that's it.

563
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:23,240
She's officially not invited to book club next summer.

564
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:25,050
I don't even know what I was thinking.

565
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:27,550
No, don't feel bad.

566
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:28,210
Look,

567
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:30,230
It's her fault for getting things started with you in the first place.

568
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,510
Oh, I know, but it was stupid.

569
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:37,540
I just wish I could make her feel as badly as I feel right now.

570
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:39,990
You totally can.

571
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:01,680
Spotted--serena and nate in a massive display of p.d.a...

572
00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:02,970
Of course.

573
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:08,630
And that's exactlywhat dan humphrey is-- pretty damn angry.

574
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:14,360
No, no, no, dan, dan, wait.

575
00:32:14,370 --> 00:32:15,590
No, thank you.

576
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,650
No, i-i didn't expect to see you.

577
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:21,330
You--you completely surprised me. i-- well, I have to say you didn't.

578
00:32:22,210 --> 00:32:24,600
Nate, huh? I guess even bad history repeats itself.

579
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:25,980
No, it--it's not what it looks like.

580
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:28,740
Let me guess-- there's an explanation? yes. of course.

581
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:31,380
I was just trying to help him make someone jealous. who?

582
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:33,230
Well, i-i can't say. why not?

583
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:35,070
Oh, well, I'm sure you can't tell me that either.

584
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:38,370
No, I can't, but that's not the point. no, that's exactly the point.

585
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:40,230
It can never just be a simple answer with you.

586
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,490
It can't just be "i kissed nate."

587
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:42,930
It has to be "i-i kissed nate because someone I 

588
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:46,380
Can't name needed to see it for a reason I can't explain."

589
00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:49,460
It's the same drama, different city.

590
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:55,200
Hi. what are you doing here?

591
00:32:55,210 --> 00:32:56,910
I came with a date. I'm glad I did...

592
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:59,880
Because since I know her date, the two of us got to meet.

593
00:32:59,890 --> 00:33:00,930
Yeah, and then we got to talking,

594
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:03,610
And we figured out that the other night at jeremiah harris' reading,

595
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:05,630
When you were making out with me...

596
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,910
You were supposed to be with me.

597
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:15,670
Oops.

598
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:25,930
No, wait. no, no, let me guess-- you can explain?

599
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,640
Catherine. what are you doing? why did you kiss serena?

600
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:35,110
You said we were through.

601
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,790
I can't believe that you would try to make me 

602
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:39,160
Jealous in front of my husband and our friends.

603
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:42,450
Well, did it work? completely.

604
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:52,590
So i...  i-i-i went a little overboard.

605
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:55,040
A little? yeah. it's true, I did.

606
00:33:55,050 --> 00:33:58,420
And I hate that I'm even able to say this, but that's, um,

607
00:33:58,430 --> 00:34:01,780
That's not the first time something like that has happened.

608
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:06,690
I, uh...

609
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:10,380
I haven't been able to get you out of my head all summer.

610
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:18,300
I-i was hoping when I saw you, I would know that we did the right thing,

611
00:34:18,470 --> 00:34:20,250
But i-i don't feel that way.

612
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:23,190
I don't feel that way at all.

613
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:30,050
Can we not talk about this right now?

614
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:32,990
Right now I just need to make sure my 

615
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,940
Grandfather's suit from the '70s isn't ruined forever... yeah.

616
00:34:37,370 --> 00:34:40,810
More than it already was by being my grandfather's suit from the '70s.

617
00:34:44,270 --> 00:34:46,970
I miss that little laugh of yours.

618
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:49,800
Shh, just...

619
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:52,600
Okay.

620
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:57,620
When words get in the way, there's really only one thing left to do...

621
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,230
Let's get out of here.

622
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,580
You wanna get out of here? yes.

623
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:10,310
I just have to say good-bye to, um, a few dozen people first.

624
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,170
Um, do you want to-- yeah, I'll--i'll-- I'll meet you at the beach.

625
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:13,630
I'll wait there. okay.

626
00:35:38,990 --> 00:35:40,740
You were right.

627
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:42,950
I used you as a weapon against chuck.

628
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:46,890
I didn't need you to be interesting, so I didn't listen when you talked.

629
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,910
I just needed you to look good...

630
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,170
Which you do.

631
00:35:56,530 --> 00:35:57,940
Just in time.

632
00:35:58,130 --> 00:36:00,520
What's the dirt on non-james schiller?

633
00:36:00,530 --> 00:36:02,480
I'm afraid we have something in common.

634
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:04,180
Well, I look good, too.

635
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:05,940
Uh, not just that.

636
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:08,400
Um, it's what I was trying to tell you earlier.

637
00:36:09,290 --> 00:36:11,980
I haven't been honest with you.

638
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:14,570
Okay, spill it.

639
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:21,830
I don't go to georgetown or princeton or any school for that matter.

640
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,910
I'm afraid I slipped up on that detail.

641
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:25,550
My name...

642
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,720
Is actually marcus beaton.

643
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,980
I'm british...

644
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:31,800
And a lord.

645
00:36:31,810 --> 00:36:33,020
What?

646
00:36:40,970 --> 00:36:42,530
Well, why didn't you tell me before?

647
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:45,520
Well, most women I meet only like me for my title.

648
00:36:45,530 --> 00:36:47,020
I vowed the next time to pretend to be 

649
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:50,470
A common american and see what happened.

650
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:55,270
But after a couple of days with you, I was afraid if I told you the truth,

651
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,450
You'd hate me for lying in the first place.

652
00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:59,420
No, not quite, my lord.

653
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:03,440
Um, the title is great and all,

654
00:37:03,450 --> 00:37:07,110
But what I'd like more than anything is a little honesty for a change...

655
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,840
From both of us.

656
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,940
When you told me I was boring before?

657
00:37:14,170 --> 00:37:16,420
No one ever tells me things like that.

658
00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:17,610
I liked it.

659
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,270
Tell me...

660
00:37:20,310 --> 00:37:22,810
Oh, what else do you think about me?

661
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:27,780
Keep talking in that accent, and I'll come up with something.

662
00:37:44,210 --> 00:37:45,300
So...

663
00:37:45,310 --> 00:37:48,410
I hear tinsley offered to help you find an internship if you want one.

664
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:50,150
Yeah, she did.

665
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:54,020
I said thanks, but I'm actually learning a lot where I am right now.

666
00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:56,420
I didn't think it was right to leave just yet.

667
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:02,360
Well, enjoy the rest of your weekend...jenny.

668
00:38:03,170 --> 00:38:07,100
I'll see you monday? I look forward to it.

669
00:38:08,730 --> 00:38:10,030
Do you think she meant any of that?

670
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:13,220
No, probably not, but at least she knows my name now, right?

671
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,080
Chuck.

672
00:38:23,270 --> 00:38:24,910
Aren't you done trying to destroy my night?

673
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:27,050
Look, I should never have abandoned you.

674
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:30,240
I knew I made the wrong decision as soon as your plane took off.

675
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:35,970
I distracted myself all summer hoping I wouldn't feel it, but I still do.

676
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,530
And?

677
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:39,440
I was scared...

678
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:44,010
Scared that if we spent the whole summer together, just us...

679
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:48,480
You'd see...

680
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:50,120
See what?

681
00:38:50,130 --> 00:38:51,660
Me.

682
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:55,760
Please don't leave with him.

683
00:38:55,850 --> 00:38:57,140
Why?

684
00:38:58,530 --> 00:39:02,060
Give me a reason, and "i'm chuck bass" doesn't count.

685
00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:04,360
Because you don't want to.

686
00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:06,190
Not good enough.

687
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:08,570
'cause I don't want you to. that's not enough.

688
00:39:16,090 --> 00:39:17,410
What else is there?

689
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:23,260
The true reason I should stay right where I am and not get in the car.

690
00:39:25,010 --> 00:39:26,410
Three words.

691
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,790
Eight letters.

692
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:33,230
Say it, and I'm yours.

693
00:39:35,050 --> 00:39:36,370
I...

694
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:41,610
I...

695
00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:43,860
Thank you.

696
00:39:45,890 --> 00:39:47,610
That's all I needed to hear.

697
00:40:16,690 --> 00:40:18,830
they say summer love is fleeting,

698
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:23,830
But sometimes, what starts as a fling can lead to the real thing.

699
00:40:26,071 --> 00:40:27,071
THE MUAC HOTEL FRIDAY NOON

700
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:29,330
A simple trip to the beach could be all it takes to clear our 

701
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:34,880
Heads and open our hearts andwrite a new ending to an old story.

702
00:40:48,410 --> 00:40:51,050
There are those who got burned by the heat.

703
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:54,030
They just want to forget and start over...

704
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:13,630
While there are others who want each moment to last forever.

705
00:41:22,970 --> 00:41:27,900
But everyone can agree on one thing-- tans fade, highlights go dark,

706
00:41:27,910 --> 00:41:30,540
And we all get sick of sand in our shoes.

707
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:34,060
But the end of summer is the beginning of a new season,

708
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:37,250
So we find ourselves looking to the future.

709
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:51,180
You ain't seen nothing yet. x.o.x.o., gossip girl.
