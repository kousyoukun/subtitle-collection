1
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:06,660
Move!

2
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:08,080
- I was born for battle.

3
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:11,290
Built for it.

4
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:17,090
Sometimes in battle, a perfectly crafted plan gets compromised.

5
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:22,050
A true general comes up with a better one right there on the spot,

6
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:25,390
working without a net

7
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:31,310
and sticking the landing to thunderous applause.

8
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:37,740
- Hurry up, you dogs!

9
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:39,320
Let's go! Let's go!

10
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:47,620
- Where are they?

11
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,620
- They were coming straight at us and then veered away on a sidetrack.

12
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:51,920
This line bends Southwest.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,500
At that speed, they could be 20 kilometers away by now.

14
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:56,170
- Or coming about to nip at our heels.

15
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:57,760
- I'm sorry, sir. There was no warning.

16
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,220
- No, they saw to that, didn't they? No satellite coverage.

17
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:03,680
A moonless night. An ambush from the shadows!

18
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,550
- As cowardly as the day they left, sir.

19
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,600
- No, they didn't drive by for nothing.

20
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,480
Forward lamps to full.

21
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:14,020
Brake!

22
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:21,240
There's a moment in a fight when that first blow lands

23
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,820
and everything stops.

24
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:27,870
And in that flash of clarity, you know who you are.

25
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:33,250
I'll push as hard as it takes to get my engine back.

26
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,590
Snowpiercer, 1,023 cars long.

27
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:58,020
Full thrust. Push through it.

28
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:01,110
- Sir, if that axel-- - Full power, Engineer. Now!

29
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:12,540
- Well done, sir. Round one to you.

30
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:16,040
- No, no, that trap wasn't meant to stop us.

31
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:17,580
It was meant to slow us down.

32
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:19,500
We can't have any setbacks today, Kevin.

33
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:22,130
Ruth's people will be energized. Find them.

34
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:23,590
- I know just where to start.

35
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:24,800
- Take the gloves off.

36
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,140
Make an example.

37
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:29,760
- I thought you'd never ask.

38
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:33,600
- And Kevin? - Yes, sir.

39
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:36,440
- Send Zarah to me.

40
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:40,110
What's our speed?

41
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:41,780
- 14 kilometers an hour.

42
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:45,700
- All right, Mr. Layton, you got us at a crawl.

43
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,450
What's the play?

44
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:53,620
Layton knows better than to connect end to end.

45
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:56,420
My Jackboots would just sweep in and crush him.

46
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,210
So he's going to peck at us from the side.

47
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:01,380
- He needs parallel track.

48
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:04,510
- And this rail yard is an entire maze of it.

49
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:23,230
He broke free of the snare but slowed down.

50
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:26,530
- We can get right up alongside him in these sidings.

51
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:28,820
They'll be in position in 2 kilometers.

52
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:30,070
- Bring us around, Ben.

53
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,240
- Copy that. - How long we got?

54
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:32,160
- Three, four minutes.

55
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,990
- All right, stay sharp. Let's get this done.

56
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,450
I'll make sure Josie's ready.

57
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:39,710
- Bess.

58
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,500
♪ Bess Till

59
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:46,300
♪ Bess! - Audrey, shut it.

60
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:48,800
- What's happening? Is it him?

61
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,180
- You'll know it's him when his head is on a pike.

62
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:01,650
- You ready for this?

63
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,230
- Ben takes us close. I jump over, breach the Big Alice engine,

64
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,360
and you reconnect.

65
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:08,740
- We only get one shot at it.

66
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,910
- Well, then, better not miss it.

67
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:38,810
- Zarah,

68
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:40,020
just in time.

69
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:42,480
Thought you should be here for this.

70
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,360
- As a hostage or a spectator?

71
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,730
- As my confidante, nothing less.

72
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:47,650
Come.

73
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,280
Come on.

74
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,320
Have a look.

75
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:55,870
See,

76
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:59,290
that's your old life creeping up our flank.

77
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,250
- Are they attacking?

78
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,130
- Maybe they're here to surrender.

79
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,550
You see any white flags?

80
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:11,970
- No. - No.

81
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:13,140
No, and if I had to guess,

82
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:15,850
I'd say they're trying to cut the head off the snake.

83
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,270
But I have a surprise for them.

84
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,230
- Heave.

85
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,110
Heave.

86
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:35,410
- Well, whatever these tin cans are for can't be good.

87
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:37,490
- Pike, man, what's the plan?

88
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:42,080
- Keep your eyes on your work.

89
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,710
- Heave. - And quit standing around! Let's go.

90
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,920
- Come on. What are you doing?

91
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,300
- All right, time to move. I'll distract them. You guys get to Ruth.

92
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:54,510
- No. Whoa, whoa. That's not how it works, man.

93
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:56,430
You're in charge now. You don't get caught.

94
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:05,270
Catch.

95
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:27,920
- We're in position.

96
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:33,630
- Josie, it's time.

97
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,550
Be careful out there.

98
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:37,970
- I'll breach the bastard, don't worry.

99
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:44,940
Now! Harpoon!

100
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:46,020
- Deploy.

101
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:52,110
- Opening cold-lock.

102
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,500
Wilford has a cannon or something. Pull back!

103
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:07,670
- Switch track. Josie, hold on.

104
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:21,350
- We're derailing! - Try to stabilize.

105
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:23,810
- Well done.

106
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,100
Never fails to amaze me.

107
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:32,270
You take so much in and give so little back.

108
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:36,450
I just hobbled your man, Zarah, and you didn't even flinch.

109
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:43,660
At this rate, the war will be over by daybreak.

110
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:59,470
- Come on. The car is damaged. We gotta go. Let's go.

111
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:03,060
- We have to cut it loose. It's gonna derail us.

112
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:04,600
- Cut here? That's four cars.

113
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,980
- It's the closest J-link. It's the only option.

114
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:08,770
- Asha's back there. - We don't have time.

115
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,730
- Go.

116
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:12,810
- You okay?

117
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:13,730
Thank you.

118
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:16,780
- She waited eight years outside. Can't very well kill her on day two.

119
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:18,700
- Safety's off.

120
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:24,410
- Disconnecting now

121
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:28,500
And we're clear.

122
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:38,130
- Here.

123
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:44,930
You'll be safer up here.

124
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,730
Hey...

125
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,810
You gonna be okay?

126
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:58,110
- Turn out the lights.

127
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:01,660
- Sure.

128
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:06,240
Hold fast, okay?

129
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,200
- We have a problem.

130
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,290
Wilford's gone.

131
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:56,710
His train went dark. He could be anywhere now.

132
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:05,590
- Switch off comms and transmitters tip to tail. Not a peep.

133
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,390
Zarah, what are you doing still on your feet?

134
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,270
You must be exhausted. Come.

135
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:20,650
- So what are you planning?

136
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:25,700
Bit of a lull. It'll do us good.

137
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:31,290
Catch our breath.

138
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:35,250
I've invested a lot in you. And the child.

139
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:38,880
I just want to keep you near me,

140
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,300
for your protection.

141
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:43,880
- And because they won't attack the engine if I'm in it.

142
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,550
- Right.

143
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,400
- How do you lose a 10-mile train?

144
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:05,900
- We were the ones that led him into this maze.

145
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:08,490
- He could be running. These six routes head out of the valley.

146
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:10,530
If he gets to linear track, we'll lose our advantage.

147
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:13,120
- Yeah, or he's around the next corner, laying in wait.

148
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,370
- He's gonna pick us off piece by piece.

149
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:17,040
I looked into the muzzle of that thing.

150
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,630
- We need to get eyes on him. Can we get to higher ground?

151
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:23,090
- Here, track follows the ridgeline. Should give us a view of the whole basin.

152
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:26,590
- Okay, let's do it. Lights out. If he's gonna go dark, so do we.

153
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:38,900
- Up and at 'em, lovebirds.

154
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:42,320
- Kevin! Get out. How dare you?

155
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,900
- Commandeering the Nightcar.

156
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:45,070
- Ugh, Kevin.

157
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:46,240
- On whose authority?

158
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,910
- Call it a wartime measure.

159
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,830
Oh, you didn't hear? Layton's back.

160
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:53,490
Up.

161
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,200
There's work to do.

162
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:18,600
- Why don't you, um, go put some coffee on?

163
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:31,820
- Who--who's there?

164
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:35,990
- Here to see the prisoner. I'm her lawyer.

165
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,410
- I don't think that's a thing anymore.

166
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,000
- Lose your helmet, Jackboot?

167
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,670
- Hey, come on, man.

168
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:43,590
Hey.

169
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:45,130
- Do you know me?

170
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:50,470
- You're--you're a Tailie. Forgive me, I-I don't know your name.

171
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:52,430
- I know you.

172
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:54,390
Whiggins.

173
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:56,100
- Yes.

174
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,390
- Well, there's two things you should know about Tailies.

175
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:02,940
We have long memories and we win wars.

176
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04,520
- Oh, yeah?

177
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:09,400
We won the last one. And we'll win this one.

178
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:12,990
And do you wanna be the guy who stands in the way?

179
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,120
Hmm, Whiggins?

180
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,160
- You have ten minutes, Counselor.

181
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:23,040
Let me just get the door for you.

182
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:32,050
- Pike?

183
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:34,510
- You're looking good, girl, with those arms dangling down.

184
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:36,760
- You shouldn't be here. It's too dangerous.

185
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:40,020
- I'm gonna get you out of here. - Wait, wait, wait. Tell me what happened.

186
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:44,560
- Wilford drove Layton off with cannon fire. Now we're rolling around in the dark.

187
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:48,820
- Well, if Wilford is hiding, then we need to signal Layton.

188
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,360
- I'm gonna get you out of here first.

189
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,240
- You can't. You'd have to kill Whiggins, and then you'd have to find Clifford

190
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,740
and kill him too, 'cause he's got the keys.

191
00:13:57,830 --> 00:13:58,910
- Go on.

192
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:02,120
- Pike, Mr. Pike,

193
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:05,380
you're a dear man and a brave one,

194
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,880
but this war is bigger than us.

195
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:13,090
- How do I signal Layton?

196
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:17,050
- I've got an idea,

197
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,010
but you'll have to get uptrain to hospitality.

198
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:33,740
Asha. Hey, you good in there?

199
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:37,870
I'm sorry, I dropped you right in the thick of it. Here.

200
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:39,700
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

201
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:41,200
- What's going on?

202
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:43,330
Did Mr. Wilford cripple the train?

203
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:45,870
- No, look, it's just some cat and mouse, all right?

204
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,540
It's fine.

205
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:49,460
- And you're supposed to be the cat? Eight of you against the great Mr. Wilford.

206
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:51,800
- The great Mr. Wilford is not who you think he is.

207
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,590
- Isn't he the one that saved all of you?

208
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:55,180
- We saved our own damn selves.

209
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:57,470
He built all of this just so he could be king.

210
00:14:57,550 --> 00:15:00,720
- So now it's your turn? - No. This is personal for us, okay?

211
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:03,640
I have a partner that I boarded with. I have a child on the way.

212
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:10,690
- Oh, if you're doing this for a child, you will do things that you will regret.

213
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:13,530
- I just came in to warn you.

214
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:15,320
We are not giving up.

215
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:18,660
This is gonna get worse before it gets better, okay?

216
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:20,660
- Okay. - Hold on.

217
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:33,800
- ♪ You are my sunshine

218
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:37,760
♪ My only sunshine

219
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:41,760
♪ You make me happy

220
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:45,430
♪ When skies are gray

221
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:49,310
♪ You'll never know, dear

222
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:53,070
♪ How much I love you

223
00:15:53,610 --> 00:16:00,490
♪ Please don't take My sunshine away

224
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,370
- You know, when you sing,

225
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:06,410
I can almost convince myself you're not a horrible person.

226
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:07,960
- Thank you.

227
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:12,920
- And then I remember you only sing covers, so the words aren't actually yours.

228
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:15,460
- Lyrics are just dressing.

229
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:17,510
I sing for him.

230
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:19,380
- Oh, God.

231
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:21,720
- You scoff,

232
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:25,060
but at the end of the day, that's all there is.

233
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:27,430
A person you sing for.

234
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:37,190
Who's that to you, Bess?

235
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:47,830
How do you get all the way to the end of the world and have no one?

236
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:50,460
- I have people.

237
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:53,130
- Who?

238
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:57,630
- Layton, Zarah, Roche.

239
00:16:58,590 --> 00:16:59,420
- Roche?

240
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:00,840
- Yeah, Roche.

241
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:04,260
He was like a mentor to me and--and a friend.

242
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:09,430
Even though I fought him, he-- he had my back.

243
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,770
No, I don't-- I don't sing for him.

244
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:15,610
But not a day goes

245
00:17:15,690 --> 00:17:18,230
by when I don't think about getting him out of those Drawers.

246
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:21,990
- I'm sorry.

247
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:26,030
I hope he survived.

248
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:29,290
- Yeah.

249
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:38,840
- We're at the ridge. Eyes up.

250
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:42,550
If he is in the valley, this is the best vantage point.

251
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:52,190
- Anything? - Till?

252
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:53,690
Negative. There's nothing.

253
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:56,650
- But they can't just vanish.

254
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:31,600
- Time to put on a show.

255
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:02,010
To the south, far end of the valley. Are you guys seeing this?

256
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:04,840
- Oh, my God. Wait, wait, wait.

257
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:06,340
Is that-

258
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,720
They're still with us.

259
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,400
- We see you, Joseph.

260
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:43,800
- He's making a break for it. East over the ridge to the trunk line.

261
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:48,180
He wants to sneak out of the rail yard because it's where we have tactical advantage.

262
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:50,760
- If he gets out of the valley, he's looking at days of linear track.

263
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:52,390
- Can we beat him to it?

264
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:54,220
- Alex? - No.

265
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:56,930
I don't know, maybe. It's all assumptions.

266
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:58,640
- What are we waiting for? Pedal down.

267
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:00,230
- Let's cut 'em off at the pass.

268
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:04,150
- Full throttle, Engineer.

269
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:06,400
- Sir, with respect, we're draining really fast.

270
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:08,240
A few ticks slower would be more efficient.

271
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,990
- They've seen us. They're coming!

272
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:15,160
Tap every last reserve and get us over that bloody ridge!

273
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:28,420
- Come on! What are you doing?

274
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:33,220
- So you have a choice, Strong Boy.

275
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:37,930
I can take two fingers next time or I can take your thumb.

276
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,480
Or you could be smart

277
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:43,520
like when you bravely volunteered to step up to my table here.

278
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:48,320
Wilford just needs you to start talking and name your collaborators.

279
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:51,700
No.

280
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,990
- No? - Come on. Leave him alone!

281
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:00,750
- Hold him. - Ah, no! No!

282
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,340
Stop!

283
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:14,180
- I didn't sign up for this.

284
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:16,260
Just wanted to serve some drinks and play some tunes.

285
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:19,560
- Would you relax? War is not pretty.

286
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,390
But Wilford will reward us.

287
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:23,190
- If he wins.

288
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:25,570
- Of course he'll win.

289
00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:28,030
If he doesn't?

290
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:30,740
- And Layton rolls in here, finds this? Finds us?

291
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:33,660
Wilford's little wedding puppets.

292
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:37,620
- We're not the torturers, all right? We're just providing a venue.

293
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:40,710
- I'm sure the mutilated guy will be quick to sort that out.

294
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:44,290
Look, if you're not gonna talk,

295
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:47,130
I guess you don't need that tongue anymore.

296
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:48,670
Hold him, please.

297
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:55,510
Hold him, hold him.

298
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:57,100
Open up.

299
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:18,330
- Look, even if we catch up with him, we still have the harpoon issue,

300
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:19,790
and we can't connect end to end.

301
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:22,540
We'll never overpower his Jackboots.

302
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:23,830
- No.

303
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:24,960
- No.

304
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:30,500
So we need a plan to get into his engine. We need a distraction.

305
00:22:31,670 --> 00:22:32,800
- Audrey.

306
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:45,060
- What's this?

307
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:47,190
- Hands behind your back.

308
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:50,360
- Ooh, handcuffs. I knew you had a kink.

309
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,530
- Move.

310
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:57,200
- Good luck.

311
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:06,670
- It's moody in here.

312
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:08,670
- Sit.

313
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:14,380
- How much further?

314
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:18,890
- We're almost at the ridge, but we're basically running on fumes.

315
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:21,930
- Keep pushing. She'll make it. Then we're home free.

316
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:27,690
- Nice and easy, Ben.

317
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:40,070
- Joseph.

318
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:58,930
- Big Alice, this is Snowpiercer. Come in.

319
00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:04,850
Snowpiercer to Big Alice, come in.

320
00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:06,020
- Sir, should--should I answer?

321
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,230
- No, no.

322
00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:13,270
- Come in, Big Alice.

323
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:21,410
- This is Big Alice. To whom am I speaking?

324
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,370
- I'm the guy standing between you and open track, Wilford.

325
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:29,790
- I see that. So it's a game of chicken, is it?

326
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:33,290
- At the rate you're going, I don't think you'll make it this far.

327
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,880
- Oh, Big Alice has more fight than you know.

328
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,470
You called this meeting, Layton.

329
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:46,100
So go on, or are we just gonna stand here pissing off our prows?

330
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:49,230
- When we left, we made a deal.

331
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:51,650
I keep Audrey safe--

332
00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:54,020
- I remember, and I don't murder everyone.

333
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:55,520
Yes, I remember the deal.

334
00:24:55,610 --> 00:24:58,900
It was made under duress, I'll remind you.

335
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:00,320
But I stuck to it.

336
00:25:00,910 --> 00:25:01,990
- Where's Zarah?

337
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:06,120
- She's right here.

338
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,460
Positively glowing.

339
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:11,500
- I'm here, Andre. I'm okay.

340
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:13,710
- And Audrey?

341
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:16,550
I want to hear her.

342
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:22,470
I need to know she's all right.

343
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:28,060
- Surrender the train and you can tell her yourself.

344
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:31,850
- Surrender?

345
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:35,610
- We'll give you a car in First, food, drink.

346
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:38,280
You two can live out your years together.

347
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:43,530
- So I--I give you absolutely everything,

348
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:46,530
and you give me a little piece back in return?

349
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:48,490
That's quite some offer, Layton.

350
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:52,460
- The offer is, we end this without violence,

351
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:57,840
or you could roll back down into that rail yard and we'll pick you apart.

352
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,130
- That's it, sir. We're tapped.

353
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:04,340
- No deal.

354
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:27,660
I...I want to hear her voice.

355
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:42,670
- Joseph.

356
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:06,570
- All right, Ben, I'm at the cold-Lock.

357
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:21,210
Soon, soon.

358
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:34,480
- Auto-engaging hot reverse.

359
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,890
We should switch helms and get Big Alice pushing again.

360
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:38,980
- Full stop, Engineer.

361
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:42,940
Let her power down.

362
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:44,360
- What? - Joseph.

363
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:52,830
- That can't be good,

364
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:54,700
can it?

365
00:27:55,410 --> 00:27:56,250
- No.

366
00:27:57,750 --> 00:27:58,750
- Snowpiercer,

367
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:01,590
we are dead on the tracks.

368
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:05,590
If you don't reconnect, everyone will freeze to death.

369
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:13,760
- You're desperate.

370
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:16,930
- And you have no choice.

371
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:25,530
- Prepare to connect. Javi, abre una cerveza, amigo.

372
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:34,620
- Commander, move your boarding party to the connection point.

373
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:37,790
- Generation deficit.

374
00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:40,000
Train-wide temperature is dropping right now.

375
00:28:40,670 --> 00:28:41,790
- Better get your woolies on.

376
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,300
- All right, boys, you ready?

377
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:49,970
- Move out. Remember where to aim.

378
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:51,930
- They're preparing to dock.

379
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:54,810
- They've got no choice.

380
00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:58,430
Let's go, let's go. Move, move, move.

381
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,060
- Cap okay?

382
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:05,360
- Hey, watch your back. Move it, move it!

383
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,740
- This is crazy, Ben.

384
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:11,660
- Yeah, pirate's life.

385
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:13,030
- Shit.

386
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,160
- You're all right.

387
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,740
Just reverse her in as fast as you dare.

388
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:18,000
- Shit.

389
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:22,120
- And don't reconnect until we're in position.

390
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:32,220
- Hey, remember, people, we're gonna clear it first.

391
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:34,970
- Weapons ready? Move!

392
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:46,440
- Christ.

393
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:48,030
Josephine.

394
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,570
She's back.

395
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:53,820
The bloody balls.

396
00:29:57,330 --> 00:29:59,660
Did you climb aboard, you little hobo?

397
00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:03,750
Uh-uh, baby on board.

398
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:07,750
No, you won't.

399
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:09,710
She won't.

400
00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:17,970
Damn. Good one.

401
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:53,840
- Tell your men to stand down or I will throw you off this train.

402
00:31:07,810 --> 00:31:09,690
- This is Head Engineer Wilford.

403
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,610
Boarding party, stand down.

404
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:20,490
We will not be taking...

405
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:24,620
Snowpiercer by force.

406
00:31:29,330 --> 00:31:31,340
Stand down. Weapons down.

407
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,420
- Oh, my God.

408
00:31:45,390 --> 00:31:46,560
- Happy now?

409
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,560
- Say it!

410
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:05,160
- Andre Layton has the train.

411
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,630
- Citizens of Snowpiercer...

412
00:32:18,090 --> 00:32:19,340
We're back.

413
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:48,000
50 meters, 40 meters,

414
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:50,330
25 meters...

415
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:03,050
- It can't be just over.

416
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:11,020
- Well, I think it's about time we get on the right side of history.

417
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,530
- Here you go.

418
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:32,830
Oz,

419
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:35,590
I love you so much.

420
00:33:56,570 --> 00:33:58,110
- Long live the Resistance!

421
00:34:46,910 --> 00:34:48,450
- Ah, found it. - Ruth?

422
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:51,750
- Andre.

423
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:55,710
- I never would have found you. You're in civvies.

424
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:01,420
I remembered that Wilford had a secret tipple up here.

425
00:35:02,130 --> 00:35:04,970
- Oh, could use some of that. - Wanna celebrate? - Yes.

426
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:08,430
- Oh, welcome home. It's good to have you back.

427
00:35:11,770 --> 00:35:13,680
- I knew you'd hold everyone together.

428
00:35:13,770 --> 00:35:14,690
Well done.

429
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:18,900
- Let's do it.

430
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,610
- Take them out.

431
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:26,820
- He's stable.

432
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:35,410
Carly's stable. And Anne--

433
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:31,340
- Javi.

434
00:36:43,570 --> 00:36:44,440
Hey.

435
00:36:53,410 --> 00:36:54,580
- Oh, man.

436
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:07,300
- This warm spot, the Horn of Africa, you really believe it can support life?

437
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:10,840
- Yeah, our future is there, Ruth. I believe it with all my heart.

438
00:37:13,010 --> 00:37:15,970
- You know, the Horn of Africa, the approach is maybe the worst stretch of track on

439
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:17,100
the entire network.

440
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:19,230
And there was a war there when the climate crashed.

441
00:37:19,310 --> 00:37:20,690
- Yeah, yeah, I remember.

442
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:23,150
- The people are tired, Andre.

443
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:25,270
It's been a long six months, and your first order

444
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:27,400
is gonna be to steer them right back into more hardship?

445
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,610
- Mm-mmm, there won't be an order. We'll put it to a vote.

446
00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:32,820
- A vote? - Yeah.

447
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:36,700
We'll show them that democracy has won. We'll choose our path forward together.

448
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:40,460
- And you're prepared for the outcome of this vote?

449
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:43,040
- I am going to convince them that it is worth the risk.

450
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:45,880
Snowpiercer's running on duct tape and prayers.

451
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:48,510
This is a real opportunity to get off.

452
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:52,510
- It's also a vote on you, Andre.

453
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:55,510
Much of the train doesn't support your leadership.

454
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,220
- This isn't just about me.

455
00:37:59,350 --> 00:38:01,430
It's what Melanie would have wanted.

456
00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:03,560
- All right.

457
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:06,190
I'll, uh, inform the notary.

458
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:09,610
I know that everyone aboard will take their vote to heart,

459
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:12,400
but are you prepared to accept it if they vote no?

460
00:38:15,410 --> 00:38:18,410
You better think long and hard about exactly what it is you're gonna tell them.

461
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:30,840
- You're confined to Third and barred from the Nightcar.

462
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:33,680
- Where's Joseph? - You picked the wrong side, Audrey.

463
00:38:37,050 --> 00:38:39,970
- Has there ever been a right side on this goddamn train?

464
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:44,190
It's all gonna go to shit. You'll see.

465
00:38:58,450 --> 00:39:00,370
- It went straight through my hand.

466
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:03,290
- Something to remember us by.

467
00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:05,750
- Look at you.

468
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:09,340
A monster come for its creator.

469
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:13,010
It's poetic, isn't it?

470
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:18,640
- Layton can't hold it together, you know.

471
00:39:19,930 --> 00:39:21,260
They'll reject him again.

472
00:39:23,930 --> 00:39:25,310
I am the train.

473
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,530
- A vote?

474
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:42,490
- That's right.

475
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:46,160
You'll get a vote today too.

476
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:50,670
Politics.

477
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:53,590
You forget about them when you're the last person on Earth.

478
00:39:56,010 --> 00:39:57,090
Thank you.

479
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,090
- Don't thank me just yet.

480
00:39:59,890 --> 00:40:01,640
There's something I need to ask of you.

481
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:05,600
- You brought me back to life, Andre.

482
00:40:08,770 --> 00:40:09,980
What is it?

483
00:40:52,730 --> 00:40:54,190
- My fellow passengers...

484
00:40:56,900 --> 00:41:01,320
Today, for the first time since our departure...

485
00:41:03,530 --> 00:41:05,870
you will have a say in our destination,

486
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:09,660
and your choice will determine our future.

487
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:13,880
By now, you know that Melanie's sacrifice gave us a map.

488
00:41:14,790 --> 00:41:18,300
Proof that there are places on the Earth that are warming.

489
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:22,550
Traveling fast and light, we tested each of them.

490
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:27,600
Sulawesi, Gujarat, Managua,

491
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:29,770
the Atacama.

492
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:32,850
And each one of these let us down.

493
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:37,230
I know that you have suffered badly

494
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:40,450
because of our decision to break the train.

495
00:41:41,490 --> 00:41:45,580
But there is one more location on which I ask you to stake your hope:

496
00:41:46,830 --> 00:41:48,290
the Horn of Africa.

497
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:52,000
The journey to return there will be fraught with risk

498
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:53,960
and the hardships will continue,

499
00:41:54,630 --> 00:41:58,670
but we have someone here who can renew our faith.

500
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:04,390
Someone we had given up on believing in.

501
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:14,150
- What's he doing?

502
00:42:14,850 --> 00:42:16,270
- But I'll let her tell you.

503
00:42:17,610 --> 00:42:18,940
- He's bullshitting.

504
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:33,540
- My name is Asha.

505
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:37,420
I am a survivor.

506
00:42:38,090 --> 00:42:40,300
Layton found me out there, outside.

507
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:45,010
Along with trees,

508
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:47,220
green grass...

509
00:42:48,850 --> 00:42:50,180
and life.

510
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:55,350
I come from New Eden.

511
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:20,710
- I'm not asking you to choose between me and Wilford.

512
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:25,930
I am asking you to choose between the train we know

513
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:28,850
and the dream we don't.

514
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:34,810
Thank you all so much for your sacrifices.

515
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:44,360
The story needed a hero, and we brought one back.

516
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:47,860
- Well, in the wake of that performance,

517
00:43:47,950 --> 00:43:49,240
the yeas have it.

518
00:43:49,910 --> 00:43:51,410
Almost two to one.

519
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:54,580
- What's one more lie?

520
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:57,370
- The difference is, this is the last one

521
00:43:57,460 --> 00:43:58,500
we will have to tell.

522
00:43:59,290 --> 00:44:01,590
- Well, I doubt that. I've come to think this train demands a lie.

523
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:08,090
- Yeah, like an imaginary genius in the engine.

524
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:11,220
- Or Melanie saving us with perfect science.

525
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:14,180
- Or a survivor to show us the way.

526
00:44:15,230 --> 00:44:16,270
- So...

527
00:44:17,690 --> 00:44:19,350
we press on. - Agreed.

528
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:21,770
- What else are we gonna do?

529
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:24,320
- Josie?

530
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:27,200
- Well, we better be right.

531
00:44:35,370 --> 00:44:39,290
- Fellow passengers, our great endeavor continues.

532
00:44:39,790 --> 00:44:46,010
You have spoken, and by majority rule, we are heading for New Eden.
