1
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:15,910
走起來
Move!

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,330
我天生就是打仗的料
- I was born for battle.

3
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:20,540
具備打仗應有的素質
Built for it.

4
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:26,340
有時在戰斗中 精心設計的計劃會遭破壞
Sometimes in battle, a perfectly crafted plan gets compromised.

5
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:31,300
一位真正的將軍 當場就能想出一個更好的計劃
A true general comes up with a better one right there on the spot,

6
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:34,640
冒著風險采取行動
working without a net

7
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:40,560
然后在雷鳴般的掌聲中 圓滿地完成任務
and sticking the landing to thunderous applause.

8
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,990
快點 狗崽子們
- Hurry up, you dogs!

9
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:48,570
快走
Let's go! Let's go!

10
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:56,870
他們在哪兒
- Where are they?

11
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:59,870
他們當時直沖我們過來 然后轉到了一條側軌上
- They were coming straight at us and then veered away on a sidetrack.

12
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,170
這條軌道拐向西南方
This line bends Southwest.

13
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:03,750
以那個速度 他們此刻可能已在20公里之外
At that speed, they could be 20 kilometers away by now.

14
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,420
或者已調頭 跟在我們后面
- Or coming about to nip at our heels.

15
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,010
對不起 先生 這事事先沒一點征兆
- I'm sorry, sir. There was no warning.

16
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:10,470
當然 他們確保了這一點 不是嗎  趁沒有衛星信號
- No, they saw to that, didn't they? No satellite coverage.

17
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:12,930
在無月之夜 從陰影中伏擊我們
A moonless night. An ambush from the shadows!

18
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:14,800
就跟他們離開的那天一樣懦弱
- As cowardly as the day they left, sir.

19
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:16,850
不 他們從我們身邊經過肯定有陰謀
- No, they didn't drive by for nothing.

20
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:19,730
把前燈開到最大
Forward lamps to full.

21
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,270
剎車
Brake!

22
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:30,490
在戰斗中 有那么一刻 你被對方的第一擊擊中后
There's a moment in a fight when that first blow lands

23
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:32,070
一切仿佛都靜止了
and everything stops.

24
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:37,120
在那一瞬間 你心開目明 認清了自己是誰
And in that flash of clarity, you know who you are.

25
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:42,500
我會竭盡全力奪回我的機車
I'll push as hard as it takes to get my engine back.

26
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:47,840
1023節車廂長的雪國列車
Snowpiercer, 1,023 cars long.

27
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:07,270
加大馬力 沖過去
Full thrust. Push through it.

28
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,360
-可是 先生 如果車軸… -全速前進 工程師 快
- Sir, if that axel-- - Full power, Engineer. Now!

29
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:21,790
干得漂亮 先生 第一局您贏了
- Well done, sir. Round one to you.

30
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:25,290
不 他們放那個陷阱 不是為了讓我們停下
- No, no, that trap wasn't meant to stop us.

31
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:26,830
而是為了讓我們減速
It was meant to slow us down.

32
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,750
凱文 我們今天不能受任何挫折
We can't have any setbacks today, Kevin.

33
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,380
魯絲的人會受到激勵的 去把他們找出來
Ruth's people will be energized. Find them.

34
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:32,840
我正好知道該從何著手
- I know just where to start.

35
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,050
手段狠點
- Take the gloves off.

36
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:36,390
殺雞儆猴
Make an example.

37
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,010
就等著您這么吩咐呢
- I thought you'd never ask.

38
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:42,850
-凱文 還有件事 -您說 先生
- And Kevin? - Yes, sir.

39
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,690
讓扎拉到這里來
- Send Zarah to me.

40
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:49,360
我們現在的速度是多少
What's our speed?

41
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,030
每小時14公里
- 14 kilometers an hour.

42
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,950
好啊 雷頓先生 你已迫使我們慢如爬行
- All right, Mr. Layton, you got us at a crawl.

43
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:56,700
你有什么花招呢
What's the play?

44
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:02,870
雷頓知道車尾對接是行不通的
Layton knows better than to connect end to end.

45
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:05,670
我手下的軍靴可以直接沖進去擊敗他
My Jackboots would just sweep in and crush him.

46
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:09,460
所以 他會從側面襲擊我們
So he's going to peck at us from the side.

47
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:10,630
他需要一條并行的軌道
- He needs parallel track.

48
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:13,760
而這片鐵路站場就像個迷宮 布滿了并行軌道
- And this rail yard is an entire maze of it.

49
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:32,480
他們擺脫了陷阱 但速度慢了下來
He broke free of the snare but slowed down.

50
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:35,780
我們可以在這些側線上 趕上他們 與其并行
- We can get right up alongside him in these sidings.

51
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:38,070
他們距離那里還有2公里
They'll be in position in 2 kilometers.

52
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,320
本 調頭
- Bring us around, Ben.

53
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:40,490
-收到 -有多少時間
- Copy that. - How long we got?

54
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:41,410
三四分鐘
- Three, four minutes.

55
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:43,240
好 機警點 咱們把這事給辦了
- All right, stay sharp. Let's get this done.

56
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:44,700
我去確保喬西已做好準備
I'll make sure Josie's ready.

57
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,960
貝絲
- Bess.

58
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:52,750
貝絲提爾
♪ Bess Till

59
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,550
-貝絲  -奧德麗 閉嘴
♪ Bess! - Audrey, shut it.

60
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:58,050
出什么事了 是他嗎
- What's happening? Is it him?

61
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:01,430
他的腦袋被插在長矛上時 你就會知道是他了
- You'll know it's him when his head is on a pike.

62
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,900
你準備好了嗎
- You ready for this?

63
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:14,480
本開到他們邊上后 我就跳過去 進大愛麗絲的機車
- Ben takes us close. I jump over, breach the Big Alice engine,

64
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:15,610
然后你們重新連接兩車
and you reconnect.

65
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,990
我們只有一次機會
- We only get one shot at it.

66
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:21,160
那就最好別錯失這個機會
- Well, then, better not miss it.

67
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:48,060
扎拉
- Zarah,

68
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:49,270
你來得正是時候
just in time.

69
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:51,730
我覺得你該看看這個
Thought you should be here for this.

70
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:53,610
以人質的身份還是旁觀者的身份
- As a hostage or a spectator?

71
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:55,980
以我的紅顏知己的身份
- As my confidante, nothing less.

72
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:56,900
來
Come.

73
00:04:57,650 --> 00:04:58,530
來啊
Come on.

74
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:02,570
看一下
Have a look.

75
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,120
看到沒
See,

76
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:08,540
從我們側翼悄悄追上來的 是你的舊相好
that's your old life creeping up our flank.

77
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:10,500
他們要攻擊我們嗎
- Are they attacking?

78
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,380
也許他們是來投降的
- Maybe they're here to surrender.

79
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:15,800
你看到白旗了嗎
You see any white flags?

80
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:21,220
-沒有 -沒有
- No. - No.

81
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,390
如果非得讓我猜的話
No, and if I had to guess,

82
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:25,100
我覺得他們是沖著龍首而來的
I'd say they're trying to cut the head off the snake.

83
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:27,520
但我有個驚喜要送給他們
But I have a surprise for them.

84
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:31,270
（W 壓縮氧）

85
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:36,480
傳下去
- Heave.

86
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:40,360
快點傳
Heave.

87
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:44,660
不管這些錫罐是做什么用的 肯定不是什么好事
- Well, whatever these tin cans are for can't be good.

88
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:46,740
派克 你有什么計劃
- Pike, man, what's the plan?

89
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,330
專心干活
- Keep your eyes on your work.

90
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:53,960
-繼續傳 -嘿 別呆站著
- Heave. - And quit standing around! Let's go.

91
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:57,170
快點 你在干什么呢
- Come on. What are you doing?

92
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:00,550
好 該行動了 我去引開他們 你們去找魯絲
- All right, time to move. I'll distract them. You guys get to Ruth.

93
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:03,760
不行 不能這么做
- No. Whoa, whoa. That's not how it works, man.

94
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,680
你現在是負責人了 你不能被抓
You're in charge now. You don't get caught.

95
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:14,520
接著
Catch.

96
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,170
我們已經就位
- We're in position.

97
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:39,550
（冷封門已鎖）

98
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:40,760
（冷封門解鎖）

99
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,880
喬西 是時候了
- Josie, it's time.

100
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:44,800
在外面當心點
Be careful out there.

101
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:47,220
我會毀掉那引擎的 別擔心
- I'll breach the bastard, don't worry.

102
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:54,190
就是現在 魚叉炮
Now! Harpoon!

103
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:55,270
準備發射
- Deploy.

104
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,360
正在打開冷封門
- Opening cold-lock.

105
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:14,750
威爾福德有一個 像大炮的玩意兒 往后撤
Wilford has a cannon or something. Pull back!

106
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:16,920
馬上更換軌道 喬西 抓緊了
- Switch track. Josie, hold on.

107
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:19,380
（軌道切換）

108
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,600
-我們要脫軌了 -設法穩住
- We're derailing! - Try to stabilize.

109
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:33,060
干得漂亮
- Well done.

110
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:38,350
你總能令我驚訝
Never fails to amaze me.

111
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:41,520
受到這么大刺激 卻沒什么反應
You take so much in and give so little back.

112
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:45,700
我剛射殘了你男人的列車 扎拉 可你連眼睛都沒眨一下
I just hobbled your man, Zarah, and you didn't even flinch.

113
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:52,910
照這個速度下去 黎明前這場戰爭就會結束
At this rate, the war will be over by daybreak.

114
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:08,720
拜托 嘿 這節車廂受損 我們得離開這里
- Come on. The car is damaged. We gotta go. Let's go.

115
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,310
得把車廂斷開 否則我們會脫軌的
- We have to cut it loose. It's gonna derail us.

116
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:13,850
從這里斷開 那可是四節車廂啊
- Cut here? That's four cars.

117
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:16,230
這是最近的連接處 這是唯一的選擇
- It's the closest J-link. It's the only option.

118
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:18,020
-阿莎在那后面 -我們沒時間了
- Asha's back there. - We don't have time.

119
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:20,980
快走
- Go.

120
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:22,060
你沒事吧
- You okay?

121
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:22,980
謝謝
Thank you.

122
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:26,030
她在外頭堅持了八年 不能上我們列車第二天就被害死呀
- She waited eight years outside. Can't very well kill her on day two.

123
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:27,950
安全栓已解除
- Safety's off.

124
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,660
開始斷開連接
- Disconnecting now

125
00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:35,240
（連接處解鎖）

126
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:37,750
斷開了
And we're clear.

127
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:47,380
這邊走
- Here.

128
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,180
你在這里會更安全
You'll be safer up here.

129
00:08:57,850 --> 00:08:58,980
嘿
Hey...

130
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:02,060
你不會有事吧
You gonna be okay?

131
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,360
把燈關了
- Turn out the lights.

132
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:10,910
沒問題
- Sure.

133
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,490
待著別動 好嗎
Hold fast, okay?

134
00:09:58,290 --> 00:09:59,450
我們有麻煩了
- We have a problem.

135
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:01,540
威爾福德不見了
Wilford's gone.

136
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:05,960
他關閉了列車的信號和燈光 不知道他們在哪里
His train went dark. He could be anywhere now.

137
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:14,840
關閉全車上下的通訊和信號傳輸 停止一切聲響
- Switch off comms and transmitters tip to tail. Not a peep.

138
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:22,640
扎拉 你怎么還站著呀
Zarah, what are you doing still on your feet?

139
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:24,520
你一定累壞了 過來
You must be exhausted. Come.

140
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,900
那你有什么打算
- So what are you planning?

141
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:34,950
稍微歇一下對我們有好處
Bit of a lull. It'll do us good.

142
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:40,540
喘口氣
Catch our breath.

143
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:44,500
我在你和這孩子身上投入了很多
I've invested a lot in you. And the child.

144
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,130
我只是想讓你待在我身邊
I just want to keep you near me,

145
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:49,550
為了保護你
for your protection.

146
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:53,130
而且如果我在機車里 他們就不會攻擊這里
- And because they won't attack the engine if I'm in it.

147
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:54,800
沒錯
- Right.

148
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:12,650
十幾公里長的列車 你怎么能跟丟了呢
- How do you lose a 10-mile train?

149
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:15,150
是我們把他帶到這片迷宮里的
- We were the ones that led him into this maze.

150
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,740
他可能想逃出去 這六條線路通向谷外
- He could be running. These six routes head out of the valley.

151
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:19,780
如果他進入了直線軌道 我們就失去了優勢
If he gets to linear track, we'll lose our advantage.

152
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:22,370
嗯 他也可能 正在下一個拐角等著我們
- Yeah, or he's around the next corner, laying in wait.

153
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:24,620
他會把我們的列車一節節地廢掉
- He's gonna pick us off piece by piece.

154
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:26,290
當時那玩意的炮口正對著我
I looked into the muzzle of that thing.

155
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:28,880
我們必須找到他 我們能去高一點的地方嗎
- We need to get eyes on him. Can we get to higher ground?

156
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:32,340
這里 這條軌道沿著山脊線 應該能讓我們看到整個盆地
- Here, track follows the ridgeline. Should give us a view of the whole basin.

157
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:35,840
好 就這么辦 把燈熄了 如果他打算隱身 我們也一樣
- Okay, let's do it. Lights out. If he's gonna go dark, so do we.

158
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,150
小情侶 起來干活了
- Up and at 'em, lovebirds.

159
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:51,570
凱文 出去 你太過分了
- Kevin! Get out. How dare you?

160
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:53,150
夜車被我征用了
- Commandeering the Nightcar.

161
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:54,320
凱文
- Ugh, Kevin.

162
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,490
誰批準的
- On whose authority?

163
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:58,160
你可以稱之為“戰時舉措”
- Call it a wartime measure.

164
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:01,080
你們沒聽說嗎 雷頓回來了
Oh, you didn't hear? Layton's back.

165
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:02,740
起來
Up.

166
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:04,450
還有活兒要干呢
There's work to do.

167
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:27,850
要不你去煮點咖啡吧
- Why don't you, um, go put some coffee on?

168
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:41,070
誰在那里
- Who--who's there?

169
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:45,240
我是來見囚犯的 我是她的律師
- Here to see the prisoner. I'm her lawyer.

170
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:47,660
我覺得現在已經沒有律師這回事了
- I don't think that's a thing anymore.

171
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:50,250
軍靴 你把頭盔摘掉了
- Lose your helmet, Jackboot?

172
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:51,920
嘿 別這樣 哥們
- Hey, come on, man.

173
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,840
嘿
Hey.

174
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,380
你認識我嗎
- Do you know me?

175
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:59,720
你是個末等人 抱歉 我不知道你叫什么
- You're--you're a Tailie. Forgive me, I-I don't know your name.

176
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:01,680
我認識你
- I know you.

177
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,640
你姓惠金斯
Whiggins.

178
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:05,350
對
- Yes.

179
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:08,640
關于末等人 有兩件事你該知道
- Well, there's two things you should know about Tailies.

180
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:12,190
我們的記性很好 而且打仗我們總贏
We have long memories and we win wars.

181
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:13,770
是嗎
- Oh, yeah?

182
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:18,650
上一場戰爭是我們贏了 這一場也一樣
We won the last one. And we'll win this one.

183
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:22,240
你想當個礙我們事的人嗎
And do you wanna be the guy who stands in the way?

184
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:24,370
惠金斯
Hmm, Whiggins?

185
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:29,410
律師先生 給你十分鐘的時間
- You have ten minutes, Counselor.

186
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,290
我替你開門
Let me just get the door for you.

187
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:41,300
派克
- Pike?

188
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:43,760
姑娘 你的氣色不錯啊 沒有缺胳膊少腿
- You're looking good, girl, with those arms dangling down.

189
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,010
你不該來這里 太危險了
- You shouldn't be here. It's too dangerous.

190
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:49,270
-我得把你弄出去 -等等 告訴我發生了什么
- I'm gonna get you out of here. - Wait, wait, wait. Tell me what happened.

191
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:53,810
威爾福德用大炮把雷頓趕走了 此刻我們正在黑暗中瞎轉
- Wilford drove Layton off with cannon fire. Now we're rolling around in the dark.

192
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:58,070
如果威爾福德在躲著雷頓 那我們就得給雷頓發信號
- Well, if Wilford is hiding, then we need to signal Layton.

193
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:00,610
我得先把你救出去
- I'm gonna get you out of here first.

194
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:04,490
不行的 要救我 你得先殺了惠金斯 然后找到克利福德
- You can't. You'd have to kill Whiggins, and then you'd have to find Clifford

195
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:06,990
把他也殺了 因為鑰匙在他手里
and kill him too, 'cause he's got the keys.

196
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,160
還有誰 繼續說
- Go on.

197
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,370
派克先生
- Pike, Mr. Pike,

198
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,630
你是個好人 一個勇敢的好人
you're a dear man and a brave one,

199
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:17,130
但這場戰爭比你我都重要
but this war is bigger than us.

200
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,340
我要怎么給雷頓發信號呢
- How do I signal Layton?

201
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:26,300
我有個主意
- I've got an idea,

202
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:29,260
但你得去列車前列的待客部
but you'll have to get uptrain to hospitality.

203
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:42,990
阿莎 你還好嗎 在這里還行嗎
Asha. Hey, you good in there?

204
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:47,120
對不起 我們讓你卷進了 最激烈的對抗中 來
I'm sorry, I dropped you right in the thick of it. Here.

205
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,950
嘿
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

206
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:50,450
發生什么事了
- What's going on?

207
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:52,580
威爾福德先生把這列車弄壞了
Did Mr. Wilford cripple the train?

208
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:55,120
沒有 聽著 這只是貓鼠之爭 好嗎 沒事的
- No, look, it's just some cat and mouse, all right?

209
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:56,790
你們是貓
It's fine.

210
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,710
你們八個人 要對付偉大的威爾福德先生
- And you're supposed to be the cat? Eight of you against the great Mr. Wilford.

211
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:01,050
“偉大的威爾福德先生” 跟你想象中的不一樣
- The great Mr. Wilford is not who you think he is.

212
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:02,840
不是他救了你們大家嗎
- Isn't he the one that saved all of you?

213
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,430
是我們自己救了自己
- We saved our own damn selves.

214
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:06,720
他打造這列列車 只是為了自己能稱王
He built all of this just so he could be king.

215
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,970
-那現在輪到你稱王了 -不 這是我們的私人恩怨 好嗎
- So now it's your turn? - No. This is personal for us, okay?

216
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:12,890
登上列車時 我有一個伴侶 她現在懷著身孕
I have a partner that I boarded with. I have a child on the way.

217
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:19,940
如果你這么做是為了一個孩子 你會做出讓自己后悔的事的
- Oh, if you're doing this for a child, you will do things that you will regret.

218
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,780
我只是過來警告你
- I just came in to warn you.

219
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,570
我們不會放棄的
We are not giving up.

220
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:27,910
局勢好轉之前 會變得更加惡劣 明白嗎
This is gonna get worse before it gets better, okay?

221
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:29,910
-明白 -堅持住
- Okay. - Hold on.

222
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:43,050
你是我的陽光
- ♪ You are my sunshine

223
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:47,010
我唯一的陽光
♪ My only sunshine

224
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:51,010
當天空灰暗時
♪ You make me happy

225
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:54,680
會帶給我歡樂
♪ When skies are gray

226
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:58,560
你永遠都不知
♪ You'll never know, dear

227
00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:02,320
我有多么愛你
♪ How much I love you

228
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:09,740
請別將我的陽光帶走
♪ Please don't take My sunshine away

229
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:11,620
要知道 你唱歌的時候
- You know, when you sing,

230
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:15,660
我幾乎都能說服自己說 你的為人并不壞
I can almost convince myself you're not a horrible person.

231
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:17,210
謝謝
- Thank you.

232
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,170
然后我會想起來你只翻唱別人的歌 所以歌詞其實不代表你的心聲
- And then I remember you only sing covers, so the words aren't actually yours.

233
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,710
歌詞只是點綴而已
- Lyrics are just dressing.

234
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:26,760
我只為他歌唱
I sing for him.

235
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:28,630
老天
- Oh, God.

236
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,970
你顯得很不屑
- You scoff,

237
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:34,310
但歸根結底 那就是全部
but at the end of the day, that's all there is.

238
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:36,680
你為之歌唱的那個人
A person you sing for.

239
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:46,440
貝絲 你的那個人是誰
Who's that to you, Bess?

240
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:57,080
你一路堅持到了世界末日 居然會沒有一個那樣的人
How do you get all the way to the end of the world and have no one?

241
00:16:58,540 --> 00:16:59,710
我有
- I have people.

242
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:02,380
誰
- Who?

243
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:06,880
雷頓、扎拉、羅齊
- Layton, Zarah, Roche.

244
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:08,670
羅齊
- Roche?

245
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,090
沒錯 羅齊
- Yeah, Roche.

246
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:13,510
他就像我的導師兼益友
He was like a mentor to me and--and a friend.

247
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:18,680
盡管我跟他對著干 他還是罩著我
Even though I fought him, he-- he had my back.

248
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:22,020
不 我不會為他歌唱
No, I don't-- I don't sing for him.

249
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:24,860
但是每一天
But not a day goes

250
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:27,480
我都在想著把他從抽屜房弄出來
by when I don't think about getting him out of those Drawers.

251
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:31,240
我很遺憾
- I'm sorry.

252
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:35,280
希望他能活下來
I hope he survived.

253
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:38,540
是呀
- Yeah.

254
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:48,090
我們在山脊上了 注意觀察
- We're at the ridge. Eyes up.

255
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:51,800
如果他在山谷里 這是能找到他的最佳位置
If he is in the valley, this is the best vantage point.

256
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:01,440
-有發現嗎  -提爾
- Anything? - Till?

257
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,940
沒有 什么都沒發現
Negative. There's nothing.

258
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:05,900
但他們不可能就這樣消失不見啊
- But they can't just vanish.

259
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:12,280
（待客部）

260
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:39,220
（W 新年流程）

261
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:40,850
好戲登場
- Time to put on a show.

262
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:11,260
看南面 在山谷的盡頭 你們看到了嗎
To the south, far end of the valley. Are you guys seeing this?

263
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:14,090
我的天啊 等等
- Oh, my God. Wait, wait, wait.

264
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:15,590
那是…
Is that-

265
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:18,970
我們的支持者還在
They're still with us.

266
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:29,650
看到你了 約瑟夫
- We see you, Joseph.

267
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:53,050
他正試圖逃跑 在山脊東側 往干線方向去
- He's making a break for it. East over the ridge to the trunk line.

268
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:57,430
他想偷偷溜出鐵路站場 我們在這里有戰術優勢
He wants to sneak out of the rail yard because it's where we have tactical advantage.

269
00:19:57,510 --> 00:20:00,010
他要是跑出去了 接下去好幾天就都是直線軌道
- If he gets out of the valley, he's looking at days of linear track.

270
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,640
我們能趕到他前面去嗎
- Can we beat him to it?

271
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,470
-艾莉  -不行
- Alex? - No.

272
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:06,180
我不知道 也許行吧 我沒把握
I don't know, maybe. It's all assumptions.

273
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:07,890
那我們還等什么 加速啊
- What are we waiting for? Pedal down.

274
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,480
我們在山口截住他
- Let's cut 'em off at the pass.

275
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:13,400
工程師 加足馬力
- Full throttle, Engineer.

276
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,650
先生 恕我直言 我們的油耗非常快
- Sir, with respect, we're draining really fast.

277
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:17,490
稍微開慢點 燃油效率會更高
A few ticks slower would be more efficient.

278
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:19,240
他們已經看到我們了 他們要來了
- They've seen us. They're coming!

279
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:24,410
用上所有的儲備燃油 越過這該死的山脊
Tap every last reserve and get us over that bloody ridge!

280
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,670
拜托 你這是干什么
- Come on! What are you doing?

281
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:42,470
強壯男孩 給你挑
- So you have a choice, Strong Boy.

282
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:47,180
接下來要我砸碎兩根手指呢 還是砸碎你的拇指
I can take two fingers next time or I can take your thumb.

283
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:49,730
你也可以聰明一點
Or you could be smart

284
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:52,770
就像你自告奮勇 到我桌子這里來時一樣
like when you bravely volunteered to step up to my table here.

285
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:57,570
威爾福德只是要你提供信息 報出你同黨的姓名
Wilford just needs you to start talking and name your collaborators.

286
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:00,950
不干
No.

287
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:05,240
-不干  -拜托 別再折磨他了
- No? - Come on. Leave him alone!

288
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:10,000
-抓住他 -不要
- Hold him. - Ah, no! No!

289
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:17,590
夠了
Stop!

290
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,430
我沒答應過要趟這渾水
- I didn't sign up for this.

291
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:25,510
我只是想經營夜總會 提供酒水和歌曲
Just wanted to serve some drinks and play some tunes.

292
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,810
你能放松點嗎 戰爭都是丑陋的
- Would you relax? War is not pretty.

293
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:30,640
但威爾福德會獎勵我們的
But Wilford will reward us.

294
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,440
前提是他能贏
- If he wins.

295
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,820
他當然會贏
- Of course he'll win.

296
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:37,280
萬一他輸了呢
If he doesn't?

297
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,990
到時候雷頓進來發現這件事 知道我們也在場 怎么辦
- And Layton rolls in here, finds this? Finds us?

298
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,910
威爾福德的傀儡夫妻
Wilford's little wedding puppets.

299
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:46,870
行刑的人又不是我們 我們只是提供了場地而已
- We're not the torturers, all right? We're just providing a venue.

300
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:49,960
我覺得被肢解的這個家伙 可不會這么認為
- I'm sure the mutilated guy will be quick to sort that out.

301
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,540
聽著 如果你不打算開口
Look, if you're not gonna talk,

302
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:56,380
那你就不再需要這舌頭了
I guess you don't need that tongue anymore.

303
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:57,920
請抓好他
Hold him, please.

304
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:04,760
抓好他
Hold him, hold him.

305
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:06,350
張嘴
Open up.

306
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:27,580
聽著 即便我們追上了他 我們還是要應付他的魚叉炮
- Look, even if we catch up with him, we still have the harpoon issue,

307
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:29,040
我們也沒法進行車尾對接
and we can't connect end to end.

308
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,790
因為我們絕對打不過他的軍靴
We'll never overpower his Jackboots.

309
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:33,080
沒錯
- No.

310
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:34,210
沒錯
- No.

311
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:39,750
所以我們得想辦法進入機車 我們需要引開他的注意力
So we need a plan to get into his engine. We need a distraction.

312
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,050
奧德麗
- Audrey.

313
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:54,310
這是要干什么
- What's this?

314
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:56,440
手放在背后
- Hands behind your back.

315
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:59,610
手銬 我就知道你有性怪癖
- Ooh, handcuffs. I knew you had a kink.

316
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:02,780
快走
- Move.

317
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,450
祝好運
- Good luck.

318
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:15,920
這里的氣氛很壓抑嘛
- It's moody in here.

319
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:17,920
坐下
- Sit.

320
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:23,630
還有多遠
- How much further?

321
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:28,140
快到山脊了 但我們的燃油即將耗盡
- We're almost at the ridge, but we're basically running on fumes.

322
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:31,180
繼續開 它能行的 然后就勝券在握了
- Keep pushing. She'll make it. Then we're home free.

323
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,940
悠著點 本
- Nice and easy, Ben.

324
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:49,320
約瑟夫
- Joseph.

325
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:08,180
大愛麗絲 這里是雪國列車 請回話
- Big Alice, this is Snowpiercer. Come in.

326
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:14,100
雪國列車呼叫大愛麗絲 請回話
Snowpiercer to Big Alice, come in.

327
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:15,270
先生 我該回答嗎
- Sir, should--should I answer?

328
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:16,480
不要
- No, no.

329
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:22,520
大愛麗絲 請回答
- Come in, Big Alice.

330
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,660
這里是大愛麗絲 我在跟誰通話呢
- This is Big Alice. To whom am I speaking?

331
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:34,620
威爾福德 我是那個 擋在你和開放軌道之間的人
- I'm the guy standing between you and open track, Wilford.

332
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:39,040
我看到了 這么說 現在就看誰的膽子更大了 是嗎
- I see that. So it's a game of chicken, is it?

333
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:42,540
按你們行進的速度 我覺得你開不到那么遠
- At the rate you're going, I don't think you'll make it this far.

334
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:46,130
大愛麗絲的韌勁比你想象的強
- Oh, Big Alice has more fight than you know.

335
00:24:47,130 --> 00:24:48,720
雷頓 這次會面是你發起的
You called this meeting, Layton.

336
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:55,350
所以 有話快說 沒必要在這里做無聊的爭執
So go on, or are we just gonna stand here pissing off our prows?

337
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,480
我們離開時 你我有個約定
- When we left, we made a deal.

338
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,900
我確保奧德麗安全…
I keep Audrey safe--

339
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:03,270
我記得 我就不把大家殺了
- I remember, and I don't murder everyone.

340
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,770
是的 我記得我們的約定
Yes, I remember the deal.

341
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:08,150
我要提醒你一句 那是在脅迫下作出的約定
It was made under duress, I'll remind you.

342
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,570
但我還是遵守了
But I stuck to it.

343
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,240
扎拉呢
- Where's Zarah?

344
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,370
她就在這里
- She's right here.

345
00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:18,710
滿面紅光
Positively glowing.

346
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:20,750
我在這里 安德烈 我沒事
- I'm here, Andre. I'm okay.

347
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:22,960
奧德麗呢
- And Audrey?

348
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:25,800
我想聽到她的聲音
I want to hear her.

349
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,720
我得知道她沒事
I need to know she's all right.

350
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:37,310
交出列車控制權 你就可以親自跟她說話了
- Surrender the train and you can tell her yourself.

351
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:41,100
交出控制權
- Surrender?

352
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:44,860
我們會給你們一節頭等車廂 提供美食酒水
- We'll give you a car in First, food, drink.

353
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,530
你們倆可以相守到老
You two can live out your years together.

354
00:25:48,530 --> 00:25:52,780
也就是說 我把一切都給你
- So I--I give you absolutely everything,

355
00:25:53,370 --> 00:25:55,780
而你只會給我一點小小的恩賜
and you give me a little piece back in return?

356
00:25:55,870 --> 00:25:57,740
這個提議太可笑了吧 雷頓
That's quite some offer, Layton.

357
00:25:57,830 --> 00:26:01,710
我的提議是 用非暴力的形式了結這件事
- The offer is, we end this without violence,

358
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:07,090
否則就回到那個鐵路站場 我們會把你拆成碎片
or you could roll back down into that rail yard and we'll pick you apart.

359
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:08,380
完了 先生 燃油耗盡了
- That's it, sir. We're tapped.

360
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,590
我拒絕
- No deal.

361
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:36,910
我想聽聽她的聲音
I...I want to hear her voice.

362
00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:51,920
約瑟夫
- Joseph.

363
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:12,240
（危險）

364
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,820
好了 本 我到冷封門了
- All right, Ben, I'm at the cold-Lock.

365
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:30,460
快了
Soon, soon.

366
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:43,730
設置自動駕駛 急速后退
- Auto-engaging hot reverse.

367
00:27:43,810 --> 00:27:46,140
我們應該調換一下車尾車頭 讓大愛麗絲在后面推
We should switch helms and get Big Alice pushing again.

368
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:48,230
停車 工程師
- Full stop, Engineer.

369
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,190
關閉電源
Let her power down.

370
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,610
-什么  -約瑟夫
- What? - Joseph.

371
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,080
這不可能是好事
- That can't be good,

372
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:03,950
會是好事嗎
can it?

373
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:05,500
不會
- No.

374
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
雪國列車
- Snowpiercer,

375
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,840
我們沒動力 啟動不了了
we are dead on the tracks.

376
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:14,840
如果你們不跟我們連接 列車上所有的人都會凍死
If you don't reconnect, everyone will freeze to death.

377
00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:23,010
你這是不顧一切了
- You're desperate.

378
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:26,180
而你則沒得選擇
- And you have no choice.

379
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:34,780
準備連接 哈維…
- Prepare to connect. Javi, abre una cerveza, amigo.

380
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:43,870
指揮官 把你的突擊小組 派到連接點去
- Commander, move your boarding party to the connection point.

381
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,040
發電不足容量
- Generation deficit.

382
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,250
整個列車的溫度正在下降
Train-wide temperature is dropping right now.

383
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,040
最好把你的毛衣穿上
- Better get your woolies on.

384
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:53,550
來吧 小伙子們 準備好了嗎
- All right, boys, you ready?

385
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:59,220
出去 瞄準中心點 記住射擊目標
- Move out. Remember where to aim.

386
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,180
他們在準備連接了
- They're preparing to dock.

387
00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:04,060
他們別無選擇
- They've got no choice.

388
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:07,680
又要開始了 快走 快
Let's go, let's go. Move, move, move.

389
00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:09,310
駕駛艙沒問題
- Cap okay?

390
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,610
嘿 留神點 進去
- Hey, watch your back. Move it, move it!

391
00:29:17,530 --> 00:29:18,990
這太瘋狂了 本
- This is crazy, Ben.

392
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:20,910
是呀 強盜生涯就是如此
- Yeah, pirate's life.

393
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:22,280
見鬼
- Shit.

394
00:29:22,370 --> 00:29:23,410
沒事的
- You're all right.

395
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:25,990
用你敢開的最快速度倒車
Just reverse her in as fast as you dare.

396
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,250
見鬼
- Shit.

397
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:31,370
我們就位之前不要與對方連接
- And don't reconnect until we're in position.

398
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:41,470
好了 各位 記住 我們要先把對方清除干凈
- Hey, remember, people, we're gonna clear it first.

399
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:44,220
武器準備好 上
- Weapons ready? Move!

400
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:55,690
老天
- Christ.

401
00:29:56,270 --> 00:29:57,280
喬瑟芬
Josephine.

402
00:29:58,650 --> 00:29:59,820
她回來了
She's back.

403
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:03,070
真夠有種的
The bloody balls.

404
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:08,910
你是爬上來的嗎 小流浪漢
Did you climb aboard, you little hobo?

405
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:13,000
這里有孕婦哦
Uh-uh, baby on board.

406
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:17,000
不 你不會的
No, you won't.

407
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:18,960
她不會的
She won't.

408
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:27,220
見鬼 真夠狠的
Damn. Good one.

409
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:03,090
叫你的人退下 否則我就把你扔出列車去
- Tell your men to stand down or I will throw you off this train.

410
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:18,940
我是首席工程師威爾福德
- This is Head Engineer Wilford.

411
00:31:20,610 --> 00:31:22,860
突擊小組 退下
Boarding party, stand down.

412
00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:29,740
我們不打算…
We will not be taking...

413
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,870
用武力拿下雪國列車
Snowpiercer by force.

414
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:40,590
退下 放下武器
Stand down. Weapons down.

415
00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:43,670
我的天啊
- Oh, my God.

416
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,810
這下開心了
- Happy now?

417
00:31:57,650 --> 00:31:58,810
快說
- Say it!

418
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:14,410
安德烈雷頓擁有了列車控制權
- Andre Layton has the train.

419
00:32:18,290 --> 00:32:19,880
雪國列車的公民們…
- Citizens of Snowpiercer...

420
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:28,590
我們回來了
We're back.

421
00:32:54,490 --> 00:32:57,250
50米 40米
50 meters, 40 meters,

422
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,580
25米
25 meters...

423
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,300
不可能就這樣結束了
- It can't be just over.

424
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:20,270
我覺得該是選擇勝利一方的時候了
- Well, I think it's about time we get on the right side of history.

425
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:33,780
給
- Here you go.

426
00:33:41,170 --> 00:33:42,080
奧斯
Oz,

427
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:44,840
我非常愛你
I love you so much.

428
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:07,360
抵抗軍萬歲
- Long live the Resistance!

429
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,700
-找到了 -魯絲
- Ah, found it. - Ruth?

430
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:01,000
安德烈
- Andre.

431
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:04,960
你沒穿制服 我都認不出你了
- I never would have found you. You're in civvies.

432
00:35:07,790 --> 00:35:10,670
我記得威爾福德 把他的好酒藏在這里了
I remembered that Wilford had a secret tipple up here.

433
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:14,220
-我正需要喝兩口 沒錯 -我想著我們可以慶祝一下
- Oh, could use some of that. - Wanna celebrate? - Yes.

434
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,680
歡迎回來 你能回來真是太好了
- Oh, welcome home. It's good to have you back.

435
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:22,930
我就知道你能把大家團結在一起
- I knew you'd hold everyone together.

436
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:23,940
干得漂亮
Well done.

437
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:28,150
我們來喝吧
- Let's do it.

438
00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:29,860
把他們放出來
- Take them out.

439
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:36,070
他情況穩定
- He's stable.

440
00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:44,660
卡莉情況穩定…還有安娜…
Carly's stable. And Anne--

441
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:40,590
哈維
- Javi.

442
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:53,690
嘿
Hey.

443
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:03,830
天啊
- Oh, man.

444
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:16,550
非洲之角這個暖點 你真的相信它能維持生命生長
- This warm spot, the Horn of Africa, you really believe it can support life?

445
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:20,090
是的 魯絲 我們的未來就在那里 我非常堅信這一點
- Yeah, our future is there, Ruth. I believe it with all my heart.

446
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:25,220
通往非洲之角的軌道是整個鐵路網內
- You know, the Horn of Africa, the approach is maybe the worst stretch of track on

447
00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:26,350
最糟的一段
the entire network.

448
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:28,480
而且氣候崩潰時 那里發生過一場戰爭
And there was a war there when the climate crashed.

449
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:29,940
嗯 我記得
- Yeah, yeah, I remember.

450
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:32,400
大家都累壞了 安德烈
- The people are tired, Andre.

451
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,520
這六個月艱苦漫長 而你回來后的第一個命令
It's been a long six months, and your first order

452
00:37:34,610 --> 00:37:36,650
就是要讓他們再經歷更多艱辛
is gonna be to steer them right back into more hardship?

453
00:37:36,730 --> 00:37:38,860
我不會下達命令 我們會投票決定
- Mm-mmm, there won't be an order. We'll put it to a vote.

454
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:42,070
-投票  -是的
- A vote? - Yeah.

455
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:45,950
我們要讓大家看看 民主已經獲勝 我們要一起選擇前進的道路
We'll show them that democracy has won. We'll choose our path forward together.

456
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,710
你已經準備好面對投票結果了
- And you're prepared for the outcome of this vote?

457
00:37:49,790 --> 00:37:52,290
我會讓大家相信這值得冒險一試
- I am going to convince them that it is worth the risk.

458
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,130
雪國列車已經損毀不堪 不拋錨已是萬幸
Snowpiercer's running on duct tape and prayers.

459
00:37:55,210 --> 00:37:57,760
這是一個真實的能下車的機會
This is a real opportunity to get off.

460
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,760
這也是對你的投票 安德烈
- It's also a vote on you, Andre.

461
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:04,760
列車上的很多人并不支持你的領導
Much of the train doesn't support your leadership.

462
00:38:05,890 --> 00:38:07,470
這件事不止關系到我
- This isn't just about me.

463
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,680
這也是梅蘭妮會想要的
It's what Melanie would have wanted.

464
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:12,810
那好
- All right.

465
00:38:13,310 --> 00:38:15,440
我去通知公證處
I'll, uh, inform the notary.

466
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:18,860
我知道列車上的所有人 都會慎重地投出這一票
I know that everyone aboard will take their vote to heart,

467
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,650
但萬一投票結果是“不去” 你有這思想準備嗎
but are you prepared to accept it if they vote no?

468
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:27,660
你最好仔細琢磨一下要怎么說服大家
You better think long and hard about exactly what it is you're gonna tell them.

469
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:40,090
只準你待在三等車廂 而且禁止進夜車
- You're confined to Third and barred from the Nightcar.

470
00:38:40,170 --> 00:38:42,930
-約瑟夫呢  -奧德麗 你站錯隊伍了
- Where's Joseph? - You picked the wrong side, Audrey.

471
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:49,220
這該死的列車上有過正確的隊伍嗎
- Has there ever been a right side on this goddamn train?

472
00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:53,440
這一切都會崩塌的 等著瞧吧
It's all gonna go to shit. You'll see.

473
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:09,620
直接扎穿了我的手
- It went straight through my hand.

474
00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:12,540
這樣你就能記住我們了
- Something to remember us by.

475
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:15,000
看看你呀
- Look at you.

476
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:18,590
怪物來找它的創造者
A monster come for its creator.

477
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:22,260
很有詩意吧
It's poetic, isn't it?

478
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:27,890
雷頓沒法把列車團結起來的
- Layton can't hold it together, you know.

479
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:30,510
他們會再次拒絕他的領導
They'll reject him again.

480
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:34,560
我是這列車的靈魂
I am the train.

481
00:39:48,530 --> 00:39:49,780
投票
- A vote?

482
00:39:50,830 --> 00:39:51,740
沒錯
- That's right.

483
00:39:53,790 --> 00:39:55,410
你今天也會有投票的權利
You'll get a vote today too.

484
00:39:58,330 --> 00:39:59,920
政治
Politics.

485
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,840
當你是世上最后一個人的時候 就會忘記政治的存在
You forget about them when you're the last person on Earth.

486
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:06,340
謝謝你
Thank you.

487
00:40:07,010 --> 00:40:08,340
先別忙著謝我
- Don't thank me just yet.

488
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:10,890
我有件事要你幫忙
There's something I need to ask of you.

489
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:14,850
安德烈 你救了我的命
- You brought me back to life, Andre.

490
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:19,230
要我幫什么
What is it?

491
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:03,440
各位乘客同伴們
- My fellow passengers...

492
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:10,570
今天是這列列車啟程以來第一次
Today, for the first time since our departure...

493
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:15,120
由你們來決定我們的目的地
you will have a say in our destination,

494
00:41:16,830 --> 00:41:18,910
而且你們的選擇將決定我們的未來
and your choice will determine our future.

495
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:23,130
你們已經知道 梅蘭妮犧牲了自己 為我們繪制了一份地圖
By now, you know that Melanie's sacrifice gave us a map.

496
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:27,550
證明地球上有些地方正在變暖
Proof that there are places on the Earth that are warming.

497
00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:31,800
我們之前輕裝出發 快速地測試了每一個暖點
Traveling fast and light, we tested each of them.

498
00:41:32,550 --> 00:41:36,850
蘇拉威西島、古吉拉特邦、馬那瓜
Sulawesi, Gujarat, Managua,

499
00:41:37,850 --> 00:41:39,020
阿塔卡馬
the Atacama.

500
00:41:40,310 --> 00:41:42,100
但它們都不合格
And each one of these let us down.

501
00:41:43,230 --> 00:41:46,480
我知道 當初我們分開列車的決定
I know that you have suffered badly

502
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,700
害你們歷盡了艱苦
because of our decision to break the train.

503
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:54,830
但還有一個地方 我覺得大家應該寄予希望
But there is one more location on which I ask you to stake your hope:

504
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,540
那就是非洲之角
the Horn of Africa.

505
00:41:58,870 --> 00:42:01,250
返回那里的行程會充滿風險
The journey to return there will be fraught with risk

506
00:42:01,330 --> 00:42:03,210
艱辛還將繼續
and the hardships will continue,

507
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:07,920
但這里有一個人 能讓我們重樹信心
but we have someone here who can renew our faith.

508
00:42:11,470 --> 00:42:13,640
一個我們以前覺得不可能存在的人
Someone we had given up on believing in.

509
00:42:22,390 --> 00:42:23,400
他這是在干什么
- What's he doing?

510
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:25,520
我會讓她自己跟你們說
- But I'll let her tell you.

511
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:28,190
他在編瞎話
- He's bullshitting.

512
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,790
我叫阿莎
- My name is Asha.

513
00:42:44,670 --> 00:42:46,670
我是一個幸存者
I am a survivor.

514
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:49,550
雷頓在外面找到了我
Layton found me out there, outside.

515
00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:54,260
在戶外 生長了樹木
Along with trees,

516
00:42:54,930 --> 00:42:56,470
青草
green grass...

517
00:42:58,100 --> 00:42:59,430
和生命的地方
and life.

518
00:43:02,890 --> 00:43:04,600
我來自新伊甸園
I come from New Eden.

519
00:43:26,130 --> 00:43:29,960
我不是要你們 在我和威爾福德之間做出選擇
- I'm not asking you to choose between me and Wilford.

520
00:43:32,050 --> 00:43:35,180
而是請你們在我們熟悉的列車
I am asking you to choose between the train we know

521
00:43:36,390 --> 00:43:38,100
和我們不熟悉的夢想之間做出選擇
and the dream we don't.

522
00:43:41,850 --> 00:43:44,060
非常感謝大家作出的犧牲
Thank you all so much for your sacrifices.

523
00:43:50,770 --> 00:43:53,610
這個故事需要一個英雄 所以我們就帶回了一個英雄
The story needed a hero, and we brought one back.

524
00:43:54,530 --> 00:43:57,110
鑒于那番表演
- Well, in the wake of that performance,

525
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:58,490
投贊同票的人勝出
the yeas have it.

526
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:00,660
幾乎是2比1的比例
Almost two to one.

527
00:44:02,790 --> 00:44:03,830
多說一個謊又怎樣呢
- What's one more lie?

528
00:44:03,910 --> 00:44:06,620
區別在于 這是我們說的最后一個謊話
- The difference is, this is the last one

529
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:07,750
我很懷疑
we will have to tell.

530
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:10,840
我開始覺得這列列車需要謊言
- Well, I doubt that. I've come to think this train demands a lie.

531
00:44:12,210 --> 00:44:17,340
沒錯 就像虛構的機車中的天才
- Yeah, like an imaginary genius in the engine.

532
00:44:17,430 --> 00:44:20,470
或是梅蘭妮用完美的科學手段 來拯救我們
- Or Melanie saving us with perfect science.

533
00:44:20,550 --> 00:44:23,430
或是為我們指路的幸存者
- Or a survivor to show us the way.

534
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:25,520
所以…
- So...

535
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:28,600
-我們繼續前進 -同意
we press on. - Agreed.

536
00:44:29,310 --> 00:44:31,020
我們還能怎樣
