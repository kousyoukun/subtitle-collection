1
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:06,660
走起來
Move!

2
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:08,080
我天生就是打仗的料
- I was born for battle.

3
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:11,290
具備打仗應有的素質
Built for it.

4
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:17,090
有時在戰斗中 精心設計的計劃會遭破壞
Sometimes in battle, a perfectly crafted plan gets compromised.

5
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:22,050
一位真正的將軍 當場就能想出一個更好的計劃
A true general comes up with a better one right there on the spot,

6
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:25,390
冒著風險采取行動
working without a net

7
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:31,310
然后在雷鳴般的掌聲中 圓滿地完成任務
and sticking the landing to thunderous applause.

8
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:37,740
快點 狗崽子們
- Hurry up, you dogs!

9
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:39,320
快走
Let's go! Let's go!

10
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:47,620
他們在哪兒
- Where are they?

11
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,620
他們當時直沖我們過來 然后轉到了一條側軌上
- They were coming straight at us and then veered away on a sidetrack.

12
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:51,920
這條軌道拐向西南方
This line bends Southwest.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,500
以那個速度 他們此刻可能已在20公里之外
At that speed, they could be 20 kilometers away by now.

14
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:56,170
或者已調頭 跟在我們后面
- Or coming about to nip at our heels.

15
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:57,760
對不起 先生 這事事先沒一點征兆
- I'm sorry, sir. There was no warning.

16
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,220
當然 他們確保了這一點 不是嗎  趁沒有衛星信號
- No, they saw to that, didn't they? No satellite coverage.

17
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:03,680
在無月之夜 從陰影中伏擊我們
A moonless night. An ambush from the shadows!

18
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,550
就跟他們離開的那天一樣懦弱
- As cowardly as the day they left, sir.

19
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,600
不 他們從我們身邊經過肯定有陰謀
- No, they didn't drive by for nothing.

20
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,480
把前燈開到最大
Forward lamps to full.

21
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:14,020
剎車
Brake!

22
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:21,240
在戰斗中 有那么一刻 你被對方的第一擊擊中后
There's a moment in a fight when that first blow lands

23
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,820
一切仿佛都靜止了
and everything stops.

24
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:27,870
在那一瞬間 你心開目明 認清了自己是誰
And in that flash of clarity, you know who you are.

25
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:33,250
我會竭盡全力奪回我的機車
I'll push as hard as it takes to get my engine back.

26
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,590
1023節車廂長的雪國列車
Snowpiercer, 1,023 cars long.

27
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:58,020
加大馬力 沖過去
Full thrust. Push through it.

28
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:01,110
-可是 先生 如果車軸… -全速前進 工程師 快
- Sir, if that axel-- - Full power, Engineer. Now!

29
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:12,540
干得漂亮 先生 第一局您贏了
- Well done, sir. Round one to you.

30
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:16,040
不 他們放那個陷阱 不是為了讓我們停下
- No, no, that trap wasn't meant to stop us.

31
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:17,580
而是為了讓我們減速
It was meant to slow us down.

32
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:19,500
凱文 我們今天不能受任何挫折
We can't have any setbacks today, Kevin.

33
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:22,130
魯絲的人會受到激勵的 去把他們找出來
Ruth's people will be energized. Find them.

34
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:23,590
我正好知道該從何著手
- I know just where to start.

35
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:24,800
手段狠點
- Take the gloves off.

36
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,140
殺雞儆猴
Make an example.

37
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:29,760
就等著您這么吩咐呢
- I thought you'd never ask.

38
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:33,600
-凱文 還有件事 -您說 先生
- And Kevin? - Yes, sir.

39
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:36,440
讓扎拉到這里來
- Send Zarah to me.

40
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:40,110
我們現在的速度是多少
What's our speed?

41
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:41,780
每小時14公里
- 14 kilometers an hour.

42
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:45,700
好啊 雷頓先生 你已迫使我們慢如爬行
- All right, Mr. Layton, you got us at a crawl.

43
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,450
你有什么花招呢
What's the play?

44
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:53,620
雷頓知道車尾對接是行不通的
Layton knows better than to connect end to end.

45
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:56,420
我手下的軍靴可以直接沖進去擊敗他
My Jackboots would just sweep in and crush him.

46
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,210
所以 他會從側面襲擊我們
So he's going to peck at us from the side.

47
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:01,380
他需要一條并行的軌道
- He needs parallel track.

48
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:04,510
而這片鐵路站場就像個迷宮 布滿了并行軌道
- And this rail yard is an entire maze of it.

49
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:23,230
他們擺脫了陷阱 但速度慢了下來
He broke free of the snare but slowed down.

50
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:26,530
我們可以在這些側線上 趕上他們 與其并行
- We can get right up alongside him in these sidings.

51
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:28,820
他們距離那里還有2公里
They'll be in position in 2 kilometers.

52
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:30,070
本 調頭
- Bring us around, Ben.

53
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,240
-收到 -有多少時間
- Copy that. - How long we got?

54
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:32,160
三四分鐘
- Three, four minutes.

55
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,990
好 機警點 咱們把這事給辦了
- All right, stay sharp. Let's get this done.

56
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,450
我去確保喬西已做好準備
I'll make sure Josie's ready.

57
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:39,710
貝絲
- Bess.

58
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,500
貝絲提爾
♪ Bess Till

59
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:46,300
-貝絲  -奧德麗 閉嘴
♪ Bess! - Audrey, shut it.

60
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:48,800
出什么事了 是他嗎
- What's happening? Is it him?

61
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,180
他的腦袋被插在長矛上時 你就會知道是他了
- You'll know it's him when his head is on a pike.

62
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:01,650
你準備好了嗎
- You ready for this?

63
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,230
本開到他們邊上后 我就跳過去 進大愛麗絲的機車
- Ben takes us close. I jump over, breach the Big Alice engine,

64
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,360
然后你們重新連接兩車
and you reconnect.

65
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:08,740
我們只有一次機會
- We only get one shot at it.

66
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,910
那就最好別錯失這個機會
- Well, then, better not miss it.

67
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:38,810
扎拉
- Zarah,

68
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:40,020
你來得正是時候
just in time.

69
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:42,480
我覺得你該看看這個
Thought you should be here for this.

70
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,360
以人質的身份還是旁觀者的身份
- As a hostage or a spectator?

71
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,730
以我的紅顏知己的身份
- As my confidante, nothing less.

72
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:47,650
來
Come.

73
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,280
來啊
Come on.

74
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,320
看一下
Have a look.

75
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:55,870
看到沒
See,

76
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:59,290
從我們側翼悄悄追上來的 是你的舊相好
that's your old life creeping up our flank.

77
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,250
他們要攻擊我們嗎
- Are they attacking?

78
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,130
也許他們是來投降的
- Maybe they're here to surrender.

79
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,550
你看到白旗了嗎
You see any white flags?

80
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:11,970
-沒有 -沒有
- No. - No.

81
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:13,140
如果非得讓我猜的話
No, and if I had to guess,

82
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:15,850
我覺得他們是沖著龍首而來的
I'd say they're trying to cut the head off the snake.

83
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,270
但我有個驚喜要送給他們
But I have a surprise for them.

84
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:22,020
（W 壓縮氧）

85
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,230
傳下去
- Heave.

86
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,110
快點傳
Heave.

87
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:35,410
不管這些錫罐是做什么用的 肯定不是什么好事
- Well, whatever these tin cans are for can't be good.

88
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:37,490
派克 你有什么計劃
- Pike, man, what's the plan?

89
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:42,080
專心干活
- Keep your eyes on your work.

90
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,710
-繼續傳 -嘿 別呆站著
- Heave. - And quit standing around! Let's go.

91
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,920
快點 你在干什么呢
- Come on. What are you doing?

92
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,300
好 該行動了 我去引開他們 你們去找魯絲
- All right, time to move. I'll distract them. You guys get to Ruth.

93
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:54,510
不行 不能這么做
- No. Whoa, whoa. That's not how it works, man.

94
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:56,430
你現在是負責人了 你不能被抓
You're in charge now. You don't get caught.

95
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:05,270
接著
Catch.

96
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:27,920
我們已經就位
- We're in position.

97
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:30,300
（冷封門已鎖）

98
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:31,510
（冷封門解鎖）

99
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:33,630
喬西 是時候了
- Josie, it's time.

100
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,550
在外面當心點
Be careful out there.

101
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:37,970
我會毀掉那引擎的 別擔心
- I'll breach the bastard, don't worry.

102
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:44,940
就是現在 魚叉炮
Now! Harpoon!

103
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:46,020
準備發射
- Deploy.

104
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:52,110
正在打開冷封門
- Opening cold-lock.

105
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,500
威爾福德有一個 像大炮的玩意兒 往后撤
Wilford has a cannon or something. Pull back!

106
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:07,670
馬上更換軌道 喬西 抓緊了
- Switch track. Josie, hold on.

107
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,130
（軌道切換）

108
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:21,350
-我們要脫軌了 -設法穩住
- We're derailing! - Try to stabilize.

109
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:23,810
干得漂亮
- Well done.

110
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,100
你總能令我驚訝
Never fails to amaze me.

111
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:32,270
受到這么大刺激 卻沒什么反應
You take so much in and give so little back.

112
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:36,450
我剛射殘了你男人的列車 扎拉 可你連眼睛都沒眨一下
I just hobbled your man, Zarah, and you didn't even flinch.

113
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:43,660
照這個速度下去 黎明前這場戰爭就會結束
At this rate, the war will be over by daybreak.

114
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:59,470
拜托 嘿 這節車廂受損 我們得離開這里
- Come on. The car is damaged. We gotta go. Let's go.

115
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:03,060
得把車廂斷開 否則我們會脫軌的
- We have to cut it loose. It's gonna derail us.

116
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:04,600
從這里斷開 那可是四節車廂啊
- Cut here? That's four cars.

117
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,980
這是最近的連接處 這是唯一的選擇
- It's the closest J-link. It's the only option.

118
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:08,770
-阿莎在那后面 -我們沒時間了
- Asha's back there. - We don't have time.

119
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,730
快走
- Go.

120
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:12,810
你沒事吧
- You okay?

121
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:13,730
謝謝
Thank you.

122
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:16,780
她在外頭堅持了八年 不能上我們列車第二天就被害死呀
- She waited eight years outside. Can't very well kill her on day two.

123
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:18,700
安全栓已解除
- Safety's off.

124
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:24,410
開始斷開連接
- Disconnecting now

125
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:25,990
（連接處解鎖）

126
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:28,500
斷開了
And we're clear.

127
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:38,130
這邊走
- Here.

128
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:44,930
你在這里會更安全
You'll be safer up here.

129
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,730
嘿
Hey...

130
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,810
你不會有事吧
You gonna be okay?

131
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:58,110
把燈關了
- Turn out the lights.

132
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:01,660
沒問題
- Sure.

133
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:06,240
待著別動 好嗎
Hold fast, okay?

134
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,200
我們有麻煩了
- We have a problem.

135
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,290
威爾福德不見了
Wilford's gone.

136
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:56,710
他關閉了列車的信號和燈光 不知道他們在哪里
His train went dark. He could be anywhere now.

137
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:05,590
關閉全車上下的通訊和信號傳輸 停止一切聲響
- Switch off comms and transmitters tip to tail. Not a peep.

138
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,390
扎拉 你怎么還站著呀
Zarah, what are you doing still on your feet?

139
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,270
你一定累壞了 過來
You must be exhausted. Come.

140
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:20,650
那你有什么打算
- So what are you planning?

141
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:25,700
稍微歇一下對我們有好處
Bit of a lull. It'll do us good.

142
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:31,290
喘口氣
Catch our breath.

143
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:35,250
我在你和這孩子身上投入了很多
I've invested a lot in you. And the child.

144
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:38,880
我只是想讓你待在我身邊
I just want to keep you near me,

145
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,300
為了保護你
for your protection.

146
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:43,880
而且如果我在機車里 他們就不會攻擊這里
- And because they won't attack the engine if I'm in it.

147
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,550
沒錯
- Right.

148
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,400
十幾公里長的列車 你怎么能跟丟了呢
- How do you lose a 10-mile train?

149
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:05,900
是我們把他帶到這片迷宮里的
- We were the ones that led him into this maze.

150
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:08,490
他可能想逃出去 這六條線路通向谷外
- He could be running. These six routes head out of the valley.

151
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:10,530
如果他進入了直線軌道 我們就失去了優勢
If he gets to linear track, we'll lose our advantage.

152
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:13,120
嗯 他也可能 正在下一個拐角等著我們
- Yeah, or he's around the next corner, laying in wait.

153
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,370
他會把我們的列車一節節地廢掉
- He's gonna pick us off piece by piece.

154
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:17,040
當時那玩意的炮口正對著我
I looked into the muzzle of that thing.

155
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,630
我們必須找到他 我們能去高一點的地方嗎
- We need to get eyes on him. Can we get to higher ground?

156
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:23,090
這里 這條軌道沿著山脊線 應該能讓我們看到整個盆地
- Here, track follows the ridgeline. Should give us a view of the whole basin.

157
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:26,590
好 就這么辦 把燈熄了 如果他打算隱身 我們也一樣
- Okay, let's do it. Lights out. If he's gonna go dark, so do we.

158
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:38,900
小情侶 起來干活了
- Up and at 'em, lovebirds.

159
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:42,320
凱文 出去 你太過分了
- Kevin! Get out. How dare you?

160
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,900
夜車被我征用了
- Commandeering the Nightcar.

161
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:45,070
凱文
- Ugh, Kevin.

162
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:46,240
誰批準的
- On whose authority?

163
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,910
你可以稱之為“戰時舉措”
- Call it a wartime measure.

164
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,830
你們沒聽說嗎 雷頓回來了
Oh, you didn't hear? Layton's back.

165
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:53,490
起來
Up.

166
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,200
還有活兒要干呢
There's work to do.

167
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:18,600
要不你去煮點咖啡吧
- Why don't you, um, go put some coffee on?

168
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:31,820
誰在那里
- Who--who's there?

169
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:35,990
我是來見囚犯的 我是她的律師
- Here to see the prisoner. I'm her lawyer.

170
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,410
我覺得現在已經沒有律師這回事了
- I don't think that's a thing anymore.

171
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,000
軍靴 你把頭盔摘掉了
- Lose your helmet, Jackboot?

172
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,670
嘿 別這樣 哥們
- Hey, come on, man.

173
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:43,590
嘿
Hey.

174
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:45,130
你認識我嗎
- Do you know me?

175
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:50,470
你是個末等人 抱歉 我不知道你叫什么
- You're--you're a Tailie. Forgive me, I-I don't know your name.

176
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:52,430
我認識你
- I know you.

177
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:54,390
你姓惠金斯
Whiggins.

178
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:56,100
對
- Yes.

179
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,390
關于末等人 有兩件事你該知道
- Well, there's two things you should know about Tailies.

180
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:02,940
我們的記性很好 而且打仗我們總贏
We have long memories and we win wars.

181
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04,520
是嗎
- Oh, yeah?

182
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:09,400
上一場戰爭是我們贏了 這一場也一樣
We won the last one. And we'll win this one.

183
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:12,990
你想當個礙我們事的人嗎
And do you wanna be the guy who stands in the way?

184
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,120
惠金斯
Hmm, Whiggins?

185
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,160
律師先生 給你十分鐘的時間
- You have ten minutes, Counselor.

186
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:23,040
我替你開門
Let me just get the door for you.

187
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:32,050
派克
- Pike?

188
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:34,510
姑娘 你的氣色不錯啊 沒有缺胳膊少腿
- You're looking good, girl, with those arms dangling down.

189
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:36,760
你不該來這里 太危險了
- You shouldn't be here. It's too dangerous.

190
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:40,020
-我得把你弄出去 -等等 告訴我發生了什么
- I'm gonna get you out of here. - Wait, wait, wait. Tell me what happened.

191
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:44,560
威爾福德用大炮把雷頓趕走了 此刻我們正在黑暗中瞎轉
- Wilford drove Layton off with cannon fire. Now we're rolling around in the dark.

192
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:48,820
如果威爾福德在躲著雷頓 那我們就得給雷頓發信號
- Well, if Wilford is hiding, then we need to signal Layton.

193
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,360
我得先把你救出去
- I'm gonna get you out of here first.

194
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,240
不行的 要救我 你得先殺了惠金斯 然后找到克利福德
- You can't. You'd have to kill Whiggins, and then you'd have to find Clifford

195
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,740
把他也殺了 因為鑰匙在他手里
and kill him too, 'cause he's got the keys.

196
00:13:57,830 --> 00:13:58,910
還有誰 繼續說
- Go on.

197
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:02,120
派克先生
- Pike, Mr. Pike,

198
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:05,380
你是個好人 一個勇敢的好人
you're a dear man and a brave one,

199
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,880
但這場戰爭比你我都重要
but this war is bigger than us.

200
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:13,090
我要怎么給雷頓發信號呢
- How do I signal Layton?

201
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:17,050
我有個主意
- I've got an idea,

202
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,010
但你得去列車前列的待客部
but you'll have to get uptrain to hospitality.

203
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:33,740
阿莎 你還好嗎 在這里還行嗎
Asha. Hey, you good in there?

204
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:37,870
對不起 我們讓你卷進了 最激烈的對抗中 來
I'm sorry, I dropped you right in the thick of it. Here.

205
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:39,700
嘿
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

206
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:41,200
發生什么事了
- What's going on?

207
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:43,330
威爾福德先生把這列車弄壞了
Did Mr. Wilford cripple the train?

208
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:45,870
沒有 聽著 這只是貓鼠之爭 好嗎 沒事的
- No, look, it's just some cat and mouse, all right?

209
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,540
你們是貓
It's fine.

210
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:49,460
你們八個人 要對付偉大的威爾福德先生
- And you're supposed to be the cat? Eight of you against the great Mr. Wilford.

211
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:51,800
“偉大的威爾福德先生” 跟你想象中的不一樣
- The great Mr. Wilford is not who you think he is.

212
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,590
不是他救了你們大家嗎
- Isn't he the one that saved all of you?

213
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:55,180
是我們自己救了自己
- We saved our own damn selves.

214
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:57,470
他打造這列列車 只是為了自己能稱王
He built all of this just so he could be king.

215
00:14:57,550 --> 00:15:00,720
-那現在輪到你稱王了 -不 這是我們的私人恩怨 好嗎
- So now it's your turn? - No. This is personal for us, okay?

216
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:03,640
登上列車時 我有一個伴侶 她現在懷著身孕
I have a partner that I boarded with. I have a child on the way.

217
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:10,690
如果你這么做是為了一個孩子 你會做出讓自己后悔的事的
- Oh, if you're doing this for a child, you will do things that you will regret.

218
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:13,530
我只是過來警告你
- I just came in to warn you.

219
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:15,320
我們不會放棄的
We are not giving up.

220
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:18,660
局勢好轉之前 會變得更加惡劣 明白嗎
This is gonna get worse before it gets better, okay?

221
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:20,660
-明白 -堅持住
- Okay. - Hold on.

222
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:33,800
你是我的陽光
- ♪ You are my sunshine

223
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:37,760
我唯一的陽光
♪ My only sunshine

224
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:41,760
當天空灰暗時
♪ You make me happy

225
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:45,430
會帶給我歡樂
♪ When skies are gray

226
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:49,310
你永遠都不知
♪ You'll never know, dear

227
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:53,070
我有多么愛你
♪ How much I love you

228
00:15:53,610 --> 00:16:00,490
請別將我的陽光帶走
♪ Please don't take My sunshine away

229
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,370
要知道 你唱歌的時候
- You know, when you sing,

230
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:06,410
我幾乎都能說服自己說 你的為人并不壞
I can almost convince myself you're not a horrible person.

231
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:07,960
謝謝
- Thank you.

232
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:12,920
然后我會想起來你只翻唱別人的歌 所以歌詞其實不代表你的心聲
- And then I remember you only sing covers, so the words aren't actually yours.

233
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:15,460
歌詞只是點綴而已
- Lyrics are just dressing.

234
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:17,510
我只為他歌唱
I sing for him.

235
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:19,380
老天
- Oh, God.

236
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:21,720
你顯得很不屑
- You scoff,

237
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:25,060
但歸根結底 那就是全部
but at the end of the day, that's all there is.

238
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:27,430
你為之歌唱的那個人
A person you sing for.

239
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:37,190
貝絲 你的那個人是誰
Who's that to you, Bess?

240
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:47,830
你一路堅持到了世界末日 居然會沒有一個那樣的人
How do you get all the way to the end of the world and have no one?

241
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:50,460
我有
- I have people.

242
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:53,130
誰
- Who?

243
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:57,630
雷頓、扎拉、羅齊
- Layton, Zarah, Roche.

244
00:16:58,590 --> 00:16:59,420
羅齊
- Roche?

245
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:00,840
沒錯 羅齊
- Yeah, Roche.

246
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:04,260
他就像我的導師兼益友
He was like a mentor to me and--and a friend.

247
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:09,430
盡管我跟他對著干 他還是罩著我
Even though I fought him, he-- he had my back.

248
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,770
不 我不會為他歌唱
No, I don't-- I don't sing for him.

249
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:15,610
但是每一天
But not a day goes

250
00:17:15,690 --> 00:17:18,230
我都在想著把他從抽屜房弄出來
by when I don't think about getting him out of those Drawers.

251
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:21,990
我很遺憾
- I'm sorry.

252
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:26,030
希望他能活下來
I hope he survived.

253
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:29,290
是呀
- Yeah.

254
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:38,840
我們在山脊上了 注意觀察
- We're at the ridge. Eyes up.

255
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:42,550
如果他在山谷里 這是能找到他的最佳位置
If he is in the valley, this is the best vantage point.

256
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:52,190
-有發現嗎  -提爾
- Anything? - Till?

257
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:53,690
沒有 什么都沒發現
Negative. There's nothing.

258
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:56,650
但他們不可能就這樣消失不見啊
- But they can't just vanish.

259
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:03,030
（待客部）

260
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:29,970
（W 新年流程）

261
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:31,600
好戲登場
- Time to put on a show.

262
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:02,010
看南面 在山谷的盡頭 你們看到了嗎
To the south, far end of the valley. Are you guys seeing this?

263
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:04,840
我的天啊 等等
- Oh, my God. Wait, wait, wait.

264
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:06,340
那是…
Is that-

265
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,720
我們的支持者還在
They're still with us.

266
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,400
看到你了 約瑟夫
- We see you, Joseph.

267
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:43,800
他正試圖逃跑 在山脊東側 往干線方向去
- He's making a break for it. East over the ridge to the trunk line.

268
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:48,180
他想偷偷溜出鐵路站場 我們在這里有戰術優勢
He wants to sneak out of the rail yard because it's where we have tactical advantage.

269
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:50,760
他要是跑出去了 接下去好幾天就都是直線軌道
- If he gets out of the valley, he's looking at days of linear track.

270
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:52,390
我們能趕到他前面去嗎
- Can we beat him to it?

271
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:54,220
-艾莉  -不行
- Alex? - No.

272
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:56,930
我不知道 也許行吧 我沒把握
I don't know, maybe. It's all assumptions.

273
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:58,640
那我們還等什么 加速啊
- What are we waiting for? Pedal down.

274
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:00,230
我們在山口截住他
- Let's cut 'em off at the pass.

275
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:04,150
工程師 加足馬力
- Full throttle, Engineer.

276
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:06,400
先生 恕我直言 我們的油耗非常快
- Sir, with respect, we're draining really fast.

277
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:08,240
稍微開慢點 燃油效率會更高
A few ticks slower would be more efficient.

278
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,990
他們已經看到我們了 他們要來了
- They've seen us. They're coming!

279
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:15,160
用上所有的儲備燃油 越過這該死的山脊
Tap every last reserve and get us over that bloody ridge!

280
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:28,420
拜托 你這是干什么
- Come on! What are you doing?

281
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:33,220
強壯男孩 給你挑
- So you have a choice, Strong Boy.

282
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:37,930
接下來要我砸碎兩根手指呢 還是砸碎你的拇指
I can take two fingers next time or I can take your thumb.

283
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,480
你也可以聰明一點
Or you could be smart

284
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:43,520
就像你自告奮勇 到我桌子這里來時一樣
like when you bravely volunteered to step up to my table here.

285
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:48,320
威爾福德只是要你提供信息 報出你同黨的姓名
Wilford just needs you to start talking and name your collaborators.

286
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:51,700
不干
No.

287
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,990
-不干  -拜托 別再折磨他了
- No? - Come on. Leave him alone!

288
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:00,750
-抓住他 -不要
- Hold him. - Ah, no! No!

289
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,340
夠了
Stop!

290
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:14,180
我沒答應過要趟這渾水
- I didn't sign up for this.

291
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:16,260
我只是想經營夜總會 提供酒水和歌曲
Just wanted to serve some drinks and play some tunes.

292
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:19,560
你能放松點嗎 戰爭都是丑陋的
- Would you relax? War is not pretty.

293
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,390
但威爾福德會獎勵我們的
But Wilford will reward us.

294
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:23,190
前提是他能贏
- If he wins.

295
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:25,570
他當然會贏
- Of course he'll win.

296
00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:28,030
萬一他輸了呢
If he doesn't?

297
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:30,740
到時候雷頓進來發現這件事 知道我們也在場 怎么辦
- And Layton rolls in here, finds this? Finds us?

298
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:33,660
威爾福德的傀儡夫妻
Wilford's little wedding puppets.

299
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:37,620
行刑的人又不是我們 我們只是提供了場地而已
- We're not the torturers, all right? We're just providing a venue.

300
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:40,710
我覺得被肢解的這個家伙 可不會這么認為
- I'm sure the mutilated guy will be quick to sort that out.

301
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:44,290
聽著 如果你不打算開口
Look, if you're not gonna talk,

302
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:47,130
那你就不再需要這舌頭了
I guess you don't need that tongue anymore.

303
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:48,670
請抓好他
Hold him, please.

304
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:55,510
抓好他
Hold him, hold him.

305
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:57,100
張嘴
Open up.

306
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:18,330
聽著 即便我們追上了他 我們還是要應付他的魚叉炮
- Look, even if we catch up with him, we still have the harpoon issue,

307
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:19,790
我們也沒法進行車尾對接
and we can't connect end to end.

308
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:22,540
因為我們絕對打不過他的軍靴
We'll never overpower his Jackboots.

309
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:23,830
沒錯
- No.

310
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:24,960
沒錯
- No.

311
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:30,500
所以我們得想辦法進入機車 我們需要引開他的注意力
So we need a plan to get into his engine. We need a distraction.

312
00:22:31,670 --> 00:22:32,800
奧德麗
- Audrey.

313
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:45,060
這是要干什么
- What's this?

314
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:47,190
手放在背后
- Hands behind your back.

315
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:50,360
手銬 我就知道你有性怪癖
- Ooh, handcuffs. I knew you had a kink.

316
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,530
快走
- Move.

317
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:57,200
祝好運
- Good luck.

318
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:06,670
這里的氣氛很壓抑嘛
- It's moody in here.

319
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:08,670
坐下
- Sit.

320
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:14,380
還有多遠
- How much further?

321
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:18,890
快到山脊了 但我們的燃油即將耗盡
- We're almost at the ridge, but we're basically running on fumes.

322
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:21,930
繼續開 它能行的 然后就勝券在握了
- Keep pushing. She'll make it. Then we're home free.

323
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:27,690
悠著點 本
- Nice and easy, Ben.

324
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:40,070
約瑟夫
- Joseph.

325
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:58,930
大愛麗絲 這里是雪國列車 請回話
- Big Alice, this is Snowpiercer. Come in.

326
00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:04,850
雪國列車呼叫大愛麗絲 請回話
Snowpiercer to Big Alice, come in.

327
00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:06,020
先生 我該回答嗎
- Sir, should--should I answer?

328
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,230
不要
- No, no.

329
00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:13,270
大愛麗絲 請回答
- Come in, Big Alice.

330
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:21,410
這里是大愛麗絲 我在跟誰通話呢
- This is Big Alice. To whom am I speaking?

331
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,370
威爾福德 我是那個 擋在你和開放軌道之間的人
- I'm the guy standing between you and open track, Wilford.

332
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:29,790
我看到了 這么說 現在就看誰的膽子更大了 是嗎
- I see that. So it's a game of chicken, is it?

333
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:33,290
按你們行進的速度 我覺得你開不到那么遠
- At the rate you're going, I don't think you'll make it this far.

334
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,880
大愛麗絲的韌勁比你想象的強
- Oh, Big Alice has more fight than you know.

335
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,470
雷頓 這次會面是你發起的
You called this meeting, Layton.

336
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:46,100
所以 有話快說 沒必要在這里做無聊的爭執
So go on, or are we just gonna stand here pissing off our prows?

337
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:49,230
我們離開時 你我有個約定
- When we left, we made a deal.

338
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:51,650
我確保奧德麗安全…
I keep Audrey safe--

339
00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:54,020
我記得 我就不把大家殺了
- I remember, and I don't murder everyone.

340
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:55,520
是的 我記得我們的約定
Yes, I remember the deal.

341
00:24:55,610 --> 00:24:58,900
我要提醒你一句 那是在脅迫下作出的約定
It was made under duress, I'll remind you.

342
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:00,320
但我還是遵守了
But I stuck to it.

343
00:25:00,910 --> 00:25:01,990
扎拉呢
- Where's Zarah?

344
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:06,120
她就在這里
- She's right here.

345
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,460
滿面紅光
Positively glowing.

346
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:11,500
我在這里 安德烈 我沒事
- I'm here, Andre. I'm okay.

347
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:13,710
奧德麗呢
- And Audrey?

348
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:16,550
我想聽到她的聲音
I want to hear her.

349
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:22,470
我得知道她沒事
I need to know she's all right.

350
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:28,060
交出列車控制權 你就可以親自跟她說話了
- Surrender the train and you can tell her yourself.

351
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:31,850
交出控制權
- Surrender?

352
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:35,610
我們會給你們一節頭等車廂 提供美食酒水
- We'll give you a car in First, food, drink.

353
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:38,280
你們倆可以相守到老
You two can live out your years together.

354
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:43,530
也就是說 我把一切都給你
- So I--I give you absolutely everything,

355
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:46,530
而你只會給我一點小小的恩賜
and you give me a little piece back in return?

356
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:48,490
這個提議太可笑了吧 雷頓
That's quite some offer, Layton.

357
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:52,460
我的提議是 用非暴力的形式了結這件事
- The offer is, we end this without violence,

358
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:57,840
否則就回到那個鐵路站場 我們會把你拆成碎片
or you could roll back down into that rail yard and we'll pick you apart.

359
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,130
完了 先生 燃油耗盡了
- That's it, sir. We're tapped.

360
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:04,340
我拒絕
- No deal.

361
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:27,660
我想聽聽她的聲音
I...I want to hear her voice.

362
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:42,670
約瑟夫
- Joseph.

363
00:27:01,610 --> 00:27:02,990
（危險）

364
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:06,570
好了 本 我到冷封門了
- All right, Ben, I'm at the cold-Lock.

365
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:21,210
快了
Soon, soon.

366
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:34,480
設置自動駕駛 急速后退
- Auto-engaging hot reverse.

367
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,890
我們應該調換一下車尾車頭 讓大愛麗絲在后面推
We should switch helms and get Big Alice pushing again.

368
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:38,980
停車 工程師
- Full stop, Engineer.

369
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:42,940
關閉電源
Let her power down.

370
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:44,360
-什么  -約瑟夫
- What? - Joseph.

371
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:52,830
這不可能是好事
- That can't be good,

372
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:54,700
會是好事嗎
can it?

373
00:27:55,410 --> 00:27:56,250
不會
- No.

374
00:27:57,750 --> 00:27:58,750
雪國列車
- Snowpiercer,

375
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:01,590
我們沒動力 啟動不了了
we are dead on the tracks.

376
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:05,590
如果你們不跟我們連接 列車上所有的人都會凍死
If you don't reconnect, everyone will freeze to death.

377
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:13,760
你這是不顧一切了
- You're desperate.

378
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:16,930
而你則沒得選擇
- And you have no choice.

379
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:25,530
準備連接 哈維…
- Prepare to connect. Javi, abre una cerveza, amigo.

380
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:34,620
指揮官 把你的突擊小組 派到連接點去
- Commander, move your boarding party to the connection point.

381
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:37,790
發電不足容量
- Generation deficit.

382
00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:40,000
整個列車的溫度正在下降
Train-wide temperature is dropping right now.

383
00:28:40,670 --> 00:28:41,790
最好把你的毛衣穿上
- Better get your woolies on.

384
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,300
來吧 小伙子們 準備好了嗎
- All right, boys, you ready?

385
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:49,970
出去 瞄準中心點 記住射擊目標
- Move out. Remember where to aim.

386
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:51,930
他們在準備連接了
- They're preparing to dock.

387
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:54,810
他們別無選擇
- They've got no choice.

388
00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:58,430
又要開始了 快走 快
Let's go, let's go. Move, move, move.

389
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,060
駕駛艙沒問題
- Cap okay?

390
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:05,360
嘿 留神點 進去
- Hey, watch your back. Move it, move it!

391
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,740
這太瘋狂了 本
- This is crazy, Ben.

392
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:11,660
是呀 強盜生涯就是如此
- Yeah, pirate's life.

393
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:13,030
見鬼
- Shit.

394
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,160
沒事的
- You're all right.

395
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,740
用你敢開的最快速度倒車
Just reverse her in as fast as you dare.

396
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:18,000
見鬼
- Shit.

397
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:22,120
我們就位之前不要與對方連接
- And don't reconnect until we're in position.

398
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:32,220
好了 各位 記住 我們要先把對方清除干凈
- Hey, remember, people, we're gonna clear it first.

399
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:34,970
武器準備好 上
- Weapons ready? Move!

400
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:46,440
老天
- Christ.

401
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:48,030
喬瑟芬
Josephine.

402
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,570
她回來了
She's back.

403
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:53,820
真夠有種的
The bloody balls.

404
00:29:57,330 --> 00:29:59,660
你是爬上來的嗎 小流浪漢
Did you climb aboard, you little hobo?

405
00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:03,750
這里有孕婦哦
Uh-uh, baby on board.

406
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:07,750
不 你不會的
No, you won't.

407
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:09,710
她不會的
She won't.

408
00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:17,970
見鬼 真夠狠的
Damn. Good one.

409
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:53,840
叫你的人退下 否則我就把你扔出列車去
- Tell your men to stand down or I will throw you off this train.

410
00:31:07,810 --> 00:31:09,690
我是首席工程師威爾福德
- This is Head Engineer Wilford.

411
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,610
突擊小組 退下
Boarding party, stand down.

412
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:20,490
我們不打算…
We will not be taking...

413
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:24,620
用武力拿下雪國列車
Snowpiercer by force.

414
00:31:29,330 --> 00:31:31,340
退下 放下武器
Stand down. Weapons down.

415
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,420
我的天啊
- Oh, my God.

416
00:31:45,390 --> 00:31:46,560
這下開心了
- Happy now?

417
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,560
快說
- Say it!

418
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:05,160
安德烈雷頓擁有了列車控制權
- Andre Layton has the train.

419
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,630
雪國列車的公民們…
- Citizens of Snowpiercer...

420
00:32:18,090 --> 00:32:19,340
我們回來了
We're back.

421
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:48,000
50米 40米
50 meters, 40 meters,

422
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:50,330
25米
25 meters...

423
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:03,050
不可能就這樣結束了
- It can't be just over.

424
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:11,020
我覺得該是選擇勝利一方的時候了
- Well, I think it's about time we get on the right side of history.

425
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,530
給
- Here you go.

426
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:32,830
奧斯
Oz,

427
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:35,590
我非常愛你
I love you so much.

428
00:33:56,570 --> 00:33:58,110
抵抗軍萬歲
- Long live the Resistance!

429
00:34:46,910 --> 00:34:48,450
-找到了 -魯絲
- Ah, found it. - Ruth?

430
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:51,750
安德烈
- Andre.

431
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:55,710
你沒穿制服 我都認不出你了
- I never would have found you. You're in civvies.

432
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:01,420
我記得威爾福德 把他的好酒藏在這里了
I remembered that Wilford had a secret tipple up here.

433
00:35:02,130 --> 00:35:04,970
-我正需要喝兩口 沒錯 -我想著我們可以慶祝一下
- Oh, could use some of that. - Wanna celebrate? - Yes.

434
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:08,430
歡迎回來 你能回來真是太好了
- Oh, welcome home. It's good to have you back.

435
00:35:11,770 --> 00:35:13,680
我就知道你能把大家團結在一起
- I knew you'd hold everyone together.

436
00:35:13,770 --> 00:35:14,690
干得漂亮
Well done.

437
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:18,900
我們來喝吧
- Let's do it.

438
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,610
把他們放出來
- Take them out.

439
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:26,820
他情況穩定
- He's stable.

440
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:35,410
卡莉情況穩定…還有安娜…
Carly's stable. And Anne--

441
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:31,340
哈維
- Javi.

442
00:36:43,570 --> 00:36:44,440
嘿
Hey.

443
00:36:53,410 --> 00:36:54,580
天啊
- Oh, man.

444
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:07,300
非洲之角這個暖點 你真的相信它能維持生命生長
- This warm spot, the Horn of Africa, you really believe it can support life?

445
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:10,840
是的 魯絲 我們的未來就在那里 我非常堅信這一點
- Yeah, our future is there, Ruth. I believe it with all my heart.

446
00:37:13,010 --> 00:37:15,970
通往非洲之角的軌道是整個鐵路網內
- You know, the Horn of Africa, the approach is maybe the worst stretch of track on

447
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:17,100
最糟的一段
the entire network.

448
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:19,230
而且氣候崩潰時 那里發生過一場戰爭
And there was a war there when the climate crashed.

449
00:37:19,310 --> 00:37:20,690
嗯 我記得
- Yeah, yeah, I remember.

450
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:23,150
大家都累壞了 安德烈
- The people are tired, Andre.

451
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:25,270
這六個月艱苦漫長 而你回來后的第一個命令
It's been a long six months, and your first order

452
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:27,400
就是要讓他們再經歷更多艱辛
is gonna be to steer them right back into more hardship?

453
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,610
我不會下達命令 我們會投票決定
- Mm-mmm, there won't be an order. We'll put it to a vote.

454
00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:32,820
-投票  -是的
- A vote? - Yeah.

455
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:36,700
我們要讓大家看看 民主已經獲勝 我們要一起選擇前進的道路
We'll show them that democracy has won. We'll choose our path forward together.

456
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:40,460
你已經準備好面對投票結果了
- And you're prepared for the outcome of this vote?

457
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:43,040
我會讓大家相信這值得冒險一試
- I am going to convince them that it is worth the risk.

458
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:45,880
雪國列車已經損毀不堪 不拋錨已是萬幸
Snowpiercer's running on duct tape and prayers.

459
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:48,510
這是一個真實的能下車的機會
This is a real opportunity to get off.

460
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:52,510
這也是對你的投票 安德烈
- It's also a vote on you, Andre.

461
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:55,510
列車上的很多人并不支持你的領導
Much of the train doesn't support your leadership.

462
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,220
這件事不止關系到我
- This isn't just about me.

463
00:37:59,350 --> 00:38:01,430
這也是梅蘭妮會想要的
It's what Melanie would have wanted.

464
00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:03,560
那好
- All right.

465
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:06,190
我去通知公證處
I'll, uh, inform the notary.

466
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:09,610
我知道列車上的所有人 都會慎重地投出這一票
I know that everyone aboard will take their vote to heart,

467
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:12,400
但萬一投票結果是“不去” 你有這思想準備嗎
but are you prepared to accept it if they vote no?

468
00:38:15,410 --> 00:38:18,410
你最好仔細琢磨一下要怎么說服大家
You better think long and hard about exactly what it is you're gonna tell them.

469
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:30,840
只準你待在三等車廂 而且禁止進夜車
- You're confined to Third and barred from the Nightcar.

470
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:33,680
-約瑟夫呢  -奧德麗 你站錯隊伍了
- Where's Joseph? - You picked the wrong side, Audrey.

471
00:38:37,050 --> 00:38:39,970
這該死的列車上有過正確的隊伍嗎
- Has there ever been a right side on this goddamn train?

472
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:44,190
這一切都會崩塌的 等著瞧吧
It's all gonna go to shit. You'll see.

473
00:38:58,450 --> 00:39:00,370
直接扎穿了我的手
- It went straight through my hand.

474
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:03,290
這樣你就能記住我們了
- Something to remember us by.

475
00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:05,750
看看你呀
- Look at you.

476
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:09,340
怪物來找它的創造者
A monster come for its creator.

477
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:13,010
很有詩意吧
It's poetic, isn't it?

478
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:18,640
雷頓沒法把列車團結起來的
- Layton can't hold it together, you know.

479
00:39:19,930 --> 00:39:21,260
他們會再次拒絕他的領導
They'll reject him again.

480
00:39:23,930 --> 00:39:25,310
我是這列車的靈魂
I am the train.

481
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,530
投票
- A vote?

482
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:42,490
沒錯
- That's right.

483
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:46,160
你今天也會有投票的權利
You'll get a vote today too.

484
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:50,670
政治
Politics.

485
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:53,590
當你是世上最后一個人的時候 就會忘記政治的存在
You forget about them when you're the last person on Earth.

486
00:39:56,010 --> 00:39:57,090
謝謝你
Thank you.

487
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,090
先別忙著謝我
- Don't thank me just yet.

488
00:39:59,890 --> 00:40:01,640
我有件事要你幫忙
There's something I need to ask of you.

489
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:05,600
安德烈 你救了我的命
- You brought me back to life, Andre.

490
00:40:08,770 --> 00:40:09,980
要我幫什么
What is it?

491
00:40:52,730 --> 00:40:54,190
各位乘客同伴們
- My fellow passengers...

492
00:40:56,900 --> 00:41:01,320
今天是這列列車啟程以來第一次
Today, for the first time since our departure...

493
00:41:03,530 --> 00:41:05,870
由你們來決定我們的目的地
you will have a say in our destination,

494
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:09,660
而且你們的選擇將決定我們的未來
and your choice will determine our future.

495
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:13,880
你們已經知道 梅蘭妮犧牲了自己 為我們繪制了一份地圖
By now, you know that Melanie's sacrifice gave us a map.

496
00:41:14,790 --> 00:41:18,300
證明地球上有些地方正在變暖
Proof that there are places on the Earth that are warming.

497
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:22,550
我們之前輕裝出發 快速地測試了每一個暖點
Traveling fast and light, we tested each of them.

498
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:27,600
蘇拉威西島、古吉拉特邦、馬那瓜
Sulawesi, Gujarat, Managua,

499
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:29,770
阿塔卡馬
the Atacama.

500
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:32,850
但它們都不合格
And each one of these let us down.

501
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:37,230
我知道 當初我們分開列車的決定
I know that you have suffered badly

502
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:40,450
害你們歷盡了艱苦
because of our decision to break the train.

503
00:41:41,490 --> 00:41:45,580
但還有一個地方 我覺得大家應該寄予希望
But there is one more location on which I ask you to stake your hope:

504
00:41:46,830 --> 00:41:48,290
那就是非洲之角
the Horn of Africa.

505
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:52,000
返回那里的行程會充滿風險
The journey to return there will be fraught with risk

506
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:53,960
艱辛還將繼續
and the hardships will continue,

507
00:41:54,630 --> 00:41:58,670
但這里有一個人 能讓我們重樹信心
but we have someone here who can renew our faith.

508
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:04,390
一個我們以前覺得不可能存在的人
Someone we had given up on believing in.

509
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:14,150
他這是在干什么
- What's he doing?

510
00:42:14,850 --> 00:42:16,270
我會讓她自己跟你們說
- But I'll let her tell you.

511
00:42:17,610 --> 00:42:18,940
他在編瞎話
- He's bullshitting.

512
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:33,540
我叫阿莎
- My name is Asha.

513
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:37,420
我是一個幸存者
I am a survivor.

514
00:42:38,090 --> 00:42:40,300
雷頓在外面找到了我
Layton found me out there, outside.

515
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:45,010
在戶外 生長了樹木
Along with trees,

516
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:47,220
青草
green grass...

517
00:42:48,850 --> 00:42:50,180
和生命的地方
and life.

518
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:55,350
我來自新伊甸園
I come from New Eden.

519
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:20,710
我不是要你們 在我和威爾福德之間做出選擇
- I'm not asking you to choose between me and Wilford.

520
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:25,930
而是請你們在我們熟悉的列車
I am asking you to choose between the train we know

521
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:28,850
和我們不熟悉的夢想之間做出選擇
and the dream we don't.

522
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:34,810
非常感謝大家作出的犧牲
Thank you all so much for your sacrifices.

523
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:44,360
這個故事需要一個英雄 所以我們就帶回了一個英雄
The story needed a hero, and we brought one back.

524
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:47,860
鑒于那番表演
- Well, in the wake of that performance,

525
00:43:47,950 --> 00:43:49,240
投贊同票的人勝出
the yeas have it.

526
00:43:49,910 --> 00:43:51,410
幾乎是2比1的比例
Almost two to one.

527
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:54,580
多說一個謊又怎樣呢
- What's one more lie?

528
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:57,370
區別在于 這是我們說的最后一個謊話
- The difference is, this is the last one

529
00:43:57,460 --> 00:43:58,500
我很懷疑
we will have to tell.

530
00:43:59,290 --> 00:44:01,590
我開始覺得這列列車需要謊言
- Well, I doubt that. I've come to think this train demands a lie.

531
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:08,090
沒錯 就像虛構的機車中的天才
- Yeah, like an imaginary genius in the engine.

532
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:11,220
或是梅蘭妮用完美的科學手段 來拯救我們
- Or Melanie saving us with perfect science.

533
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:14,180
或是為我們指路的幸存者
- Or a survivor to show us the way.

534
00:44:15,230 --> 00:44:16,270
所以…
- So...

535
00:44:17,690 --> 00:44:19,350
-我們繼續前進 -同意
we press on. - Agreed.

536
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:21,770
我們還能怎樣
