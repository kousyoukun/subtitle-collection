1
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:15,910
走起来
Move!

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,330
我天生就是打仗的料
- I was born for battle.

3
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:20,540
具备打仗应有的素质
Built for it.

4
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:26,340
有时在战斗中 精心设计的计划会遭破坏
Sometimes in battle, a perfectly crafted plan gets compromised.

5
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:31,300
一位真正的将军 当场就能想出一个更好的计划
A true general comes up with a better one right there on the spot,

6
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:34,640
冒着风险采取行动
working without a net

7
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:40,560
然后在雷鸣般的掌声中 圆满地完成任务
and sticking the landing to thunderous applause.

8
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,990
快点 狗崽子们
- Hurry up, you dogs!

9
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:48,570
快走
Let's go! Let's go!

10
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:56,870
他们在哪儿
- Where are they?

11
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:59,870
他们当时直冲我们过来 然后转到了一条侧轨上
- They were coming straight at us and then veered away on a sidetrack.

12
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,170
这条轨道拐向西南方
This line bends Southwest.

13
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:03,750
以那个速度 他们此刻可能已在20公里之外
At that speed, they could be 20 kilometers away by now.

14
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,420
或者已调头 跟在我们后面
- Or coming about to nip at our heels.

15
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,010
对不起 先生 这事事先没一点征兆
- I'm sorry, sir. There was no warning.

16
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:10,470
当然 他们确保了这一点 不是吗  趁没有卫星信号
- No, they saw to that, didn't they? No satellite coverage.

17
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:12,930
在无月之夜 从阴影中伏击我们
A moonless night. An ambush from the shadows!

18
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:14,800
就跟他们离开的那天一样懦弱
- As cowardly as the day they left, sir.

19
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:16,850
不 他们从我们身边经过肯定有阴谋
- No, they didn't drive by for nothing.

20
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:19,730
把前灯开到最大
Forward lamps to full.

21
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,270
刹车
Brake!

22
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:30,490
在战斗中 有那么一刻 你被对方的第一击击中后
There's a moment in a fight when that first blow lands

23
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:32,070
一切仿佛都静止了
and everything stops.

24
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:37,120
在那一瞬间 你心开目明 认清了自己是谁
And in that flash of clarity, you know who you are.

25
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:42,500
我会竭尽全力夺回我的机车
I'll push as hard as it takes to get my engine back.

26
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:47,840
1023节车厢长的雪国列车
Snowpiercer, 1,023 cars long.

27
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:07,270
加大马力 冲过去
Full thrust. Push through it.

28
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,360
-可是 先生 如果车轴… -全速前进 工程师 快
- Sir, if that axel-- - Full power, Engineer. Now!

29
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:21,790
干得漂亮 先生 第一局您赢了
- Well done, sir. Round one to you.

30
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:25,290
不 他们放那个陷阱 不是为了让我们停下
- No, no, that trap wasn't meant to stop us.

31
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:26,830
而是为了让我们减速
It was meant to slow us down.

32
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,750
凯文 我们今天不能受任何挫折
We can't have any setbacks today, Kevin.

33
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,380
鲁丝的人会受到激励的 去把他们找出来
Ruth's people will be energized. Find them.

34
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:32,840
我正好知道该从何着手
- I know just where to start.

35
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,050
手段狠点
- Take the gloves off.

36
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:36,390
杀鸡儆猴
Make an example.

37
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,010
就等着您这么吩咐呢
- I thought you'd never ask.

38
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:42,850
-凯文 还有件事 -您说 先生
- And Kevin? - Yes, sir.

39
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,690
让扎拉到这里来
- Send Zarah to me.

40
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:49,360
我们现在的速度是多少
What's our speed?

41
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,030
每小时14公里
- 14 kilometers an hour.

42
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,950
好啊 雷顿先生 你已迫使我们慢如爬行
- All right, Mr. Layton, you got us at a crawl.

43
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:56,700
你有什么花招呢
What's the play?

44
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:02,870
雷顿知道车尾对接是行不通的
Layton knows better than to connect end to end.

45
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:05,670
我手下的军靴可以直接冲进去击败他
My Jackboots would just sweep in and crush him.

46
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:09,460
所以 他会从侧面袭击我们
So he's going to peck at us from the side.

47
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:10,630
他需要一条并行的轨道
- He needs parallel track.

48
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:13,760
而这片铁路站场就像个迷宫 布满了并行轨道
- And this rail yard is an entire maze of it.

49
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:32,480
他们摆脱了陷阱 但速度慢了下来
He broke free of the snare but slowed down.

50
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:35,780
我们可以在这些侧线上 赶上他们 与其并行
- We can get right up alongside him in these sidings.

51
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:38,070
他们距离那里还有2公里
They'll be in position in 2 kilometers.

52
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,320
本 调头
- Bring us around, Ben.

53
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:40,490
-收到 -有多少时间
- Copy that. - How long we got?

54
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:41,410
三四分钟
- Three, four minutes.

55
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:43,240
好 机警点 咱们把这事给办了
- All right, stay sharp. Let's get this done.

56
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:44,700
我去确保乔西已做好准备
I'll make sure Josie's ready.

57
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,960
贝丝
- Bess.

58
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:52,750
贝丝提尔
♪ Bess Till

59
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,550
-贝丝  -奥德丽 闭嘴
♪ Bess! - Audrey, shut it.

60
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:58,050
出什么事了 是他吗
- What's happening? Is it him?

61
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:01,430
他的脑袋被插在长矛上时 你就会知道是他了
- You'll know it's him when his head is on a pike.

62
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,900
你准备好了吗
- You ready for this?

63
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:14,480
本开到他们边上后 我就跳过去 进大爱丽丝的机车
- Ben takes us close. I jump over, breach the Big Alice engine,

64
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:15,610
然后你们重新连接两车
and you reconnect.

65
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,990
我们只有一次机会
- We only get one shot at it.

66
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:21,160
那就最好别错失这个机会
- Well, then, better not miss it.

67
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:48,060
扎拉
- Zarah,

68
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:49,270
你来得正是时候
just in time.

69
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:51,730
我觉得你该看看这个
Thought you should be here for this.

70
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:53,610
以人质的身份还是旁观者的身份
- As a hostage or a spectator?

71
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:55,980
以我的红颜知己的身份
- As my confidante, nothing less.

72
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:56,900
来
Come.

73
00:04:57,650 --> 00:04:58,530
来啊
Come on.

74
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:02,570
看一下
Have a look.

75
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,120
看到没
See,

76
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:08,540
从我们侧翼悄悄追上来的 是你的旧相好
that's your old life creeping up our flank.

77
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:10,500
他们要攻击我们吗
- Are they attacking?

78
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,380
也许他们是来投降的
- Maybe they're here to surrender.

79
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:15,800
你看到白旗了吗
You see any white flags?

80
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:21,220
-没有 -没有
- No. - No.

81
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,390
如果非得让我猜的话
No, and if I had to guess,

82
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:25,100
我觉得他们是冲着龙首而来的
I'd say they're trying to cut the head off the snake.

83
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:27,520
但我有个惊喜要送给他们
But I have a surprise for them.

84
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:31,270
（W 压缩氧）

85
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:36,480
传下去
- Heave.

86
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:40,360
快点传
Heave.

87
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:44,660
不管这些锡罐是做什么用的 肯定不是什么好事
- Well, whatever these tin cans are for can't be good.

88
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:46,740
派克 你有什么计划
- Pike, man, what's the plan?

89
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,330
专心干活
- Keep your eyes on your work.

90
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:53,960
-继续传 -嘿 别呆站着
- Heave. - And quit standing around! Let's go.

91
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:57,170
快点 你在干什么呢
- Come on. What are you doing?

92
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:00,550
好 该行动了 我去引开他们 你们去找鲁丝
- All right, time to move. I'll distract them. You guys get to Ruth.

93
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:03,760
不行 不能这么做
- No. Whoa, whoa. That's not how it works, man.

94
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,680
你现在是负责人了 你不能被抓
You're in charge now. You don't get caught.

95
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:14,520
接着
Catch.

96
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,170
我们已经就位
- We're in position.

97
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:39,550
（冷封门已锁）

98
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:40,760
（冷封门解锁）

99
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,880
乔西 是时候了
- Josie, it's time.

100
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:44,800
在外面当心点
Be careful out there.

101
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:47,220
我会毁掉那引擎的 别担心
- I'll breach the bastard, don't worry.

102
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:54,190
就是现在 鱼叉炮
Now! Harpoon!

103
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:55,270
准备发射
- Deploy.

104
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,360
正在打开冷封门
- Opening cold-lock.

105
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:14,750
威尔福德有一个 像大炮的玩意儿 往后撤
Wilford has a cannon or something. Pull back!

106
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:16,920
马上更换轨道 乔西 抓紧了
- Switch track. Josie, hold on.

107
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:19,380
（轨道切换）

108
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,600
-我们要脱轨了 -设法稳住
- We're derailing! - Try to stabilize.

109
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:33,060
干得漂亮
- Well done.

110
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:38,350
你总能令我惊讶
Never fails to amaze me.

111
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:41,520
受到这么大刺激 却没什么反应
You take so much in and give so little back.

112
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:45,700
我刚射残了你男人的列车 扎拉 可你连眼睛都没眨一下
I just hobbled your man, Zarah, and you didn't even flinch.

113
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:52,910
照这个速度下去 黎明前这场战争就会结束
At this rate, the war will be over by daybreak.

114
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:08,720
拜托 嘿 这节车厢受损 我们得离开这里
- Come on. The car is damaged. We gotta go. Let's go.

115
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,310
得把车厢断开 否则我们会脱轨的
- We have to cut it loose. It's gonna derail us.

116
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:13,850
从这里断开 那可是四节车厢啊
- Cut here? That's four cars.

117
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:16,230
这是最近的连接处 这是唯一的选择
- It's the closest J-link. It's the only option.

118
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:18,020
-阿莎在那后面 -我们没时间了
- Asha's back there. - We don't have time.

119
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:20,980
快走
- Go.

120
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:22,060
你没事吧
- You okay?

121
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:22,980
谢谢
Thank you.

122
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:26,030
她在外头坚持了八年 不能上我们列车第二天就被害死呀
- She waited eight years outside. Can't very well kill her on day two.

123
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:27,950
安全栓已解除
- Safety's off.

124
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,660
开始断开连接
- Disconnecting now

125
00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:35,240
（连接处解锁）

126
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:37,750
断开了
And we're clear.

127
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:47,380
这边走
- Here.

128
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,180
你在这里会更安全
You'll be safer up here.

129
00:08:57,850 --> 00:08:58,980
嘿
Hey...

130
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:02,060
你不会有事吧
You gonna be okay?

131
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,360
把灯关了
- Turn out the lights.

132
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:10,910
没问题
- Sure.

133
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,490
待着别动 好吗
Hold fast, okay?

134
00:09:58,290 --> 00:09:59,450
我们有麻烦了
- We have a problem.

135
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:01,540
威尔福德不见了
Wilford's gone.

136
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:05,960
他关闭了列车的信号和灯光 不知道他们在哪里
His train went dark. He could be anywhere now.

137
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:14,840
关闭全车上下的通讯和信号传输 停止一切声响
- Switch off comms and transmitters tip to tail. Not a peep.

138
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:22,640
扎拉 你怎么还站着呀
Zarah, what are you doing still on your feet?

139
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:24,520
你一定累坏了 过来
You must be exhausted. Come.

140
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,900
那你有什么打算
- So what are you planning?

141
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:34,950
稍微歇一下对我们有好处
Bit of a lull. It'll do us good.

142
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:40,540
喘口气
Catch our breath.

143
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:44,500
我在你和这孩子身上投入了很多
I've invested a lot in you. And the child.

144
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,130
我只是想让你待在我身边
I just want to keep you near me,

145
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:49,550
为了保护你
for your protection.

146
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:53,130
而且如果我在机车里 他们就不会攻击这里
- And because they won't attack the engine if I'm in it.

147
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:54,800
没错
- Right.

148
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:12,650
十几公里长的列车 你怎么能跟丢了呢
- How do you lose a 10-mile train?

149
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:15,150
是我们把他带到这片迷宫里的
- We were the ones that led him into this maze.

150
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,740
他可能想逃出去 这六条线路通向谷外
- He could be running. These six routes head out of the valley.

151
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:19,780
如果他进入了直线轨道 我们就失去了优势
If he gets to linear track, we'll lose our advantage.

152
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:22,370
嗯 他也可能 正在下一个拐角等着我们
- Yeah, or he's around the next corner, laying in wait.

153
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:24,620
他会把我们的列车一节节地废掉
- He's gonna pick us off piece by piece.

154
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:26,290
当时那玩意的炮口正对着我
I looked into the muzzle of that thing.

155
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:28,880
我们必须找到他 我们能去高一点的地方吗
- We need to get eyes on him. Can we get to higher ground?

156
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:32,340
这里 这条轨道沿着山脊线 应该能让我们看到整个盆地
- Here, track follows the ridgeline. Should give us a view of the whole basin.

157
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:35,840
好 就这么办 把灯熄了 如果他打算隐身 我们也一样
- Okay, let's do it. Lights out. If he's gonna go dark, so do we.

158
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,150
小情侣 起来干活了
- Up and at 'em, lovebirds.

159
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:51,570
凯文 出去 你太过分了
- Kevin! Get out. How dare you?

160
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:53,150
夜车被我征用了
- Commandeering the Nightcar.

161
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:54,320
凯文
- Ugh, Kevin.

162
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,490
谁批准的
- On whose authority?

163
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:58,160
你可以称之为“战时举措”
- Call it a wartime measure.

164
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:01,080
你们没听说吗 雷顿回来了
Oh, you didn't hear? Layton's back.

165
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:02,740
起来
Up.

166
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:04,450
还有活儿要干呢
There's work to do.

167
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:27,850
要不你去煮点咖啡吧
- Why don't you, um, go put some coffee on?

168
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:41,070
谁在那里
- Who--who's there?

169
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:45,240
我是来见囚犯的 我是她的律师
- Here to see the prisoner. I'm her lawyer.

170
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:47,660
我觉得现在已经没有律师这回事了
- I don't think that's a thing anymore.

171
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:50,250
军靴 你把头盔摘掉了
- Lose your helmet, Jackboot?

172
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:51,920
嘿 别这样 哥们
- Hey, come on, man.

173
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,840
嘿
Hey.

174
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,380
你认识我吗
- Do you know me?

175
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:59,720
你是个末等人 抱歉 我不知道你叫什么
- You're--you're a Tailie. Forgive me, I-I don't know your name.

176
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:01,680
我认识你
- I know you.

177
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,640
你姓惠金斯
Whiggins.

178
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:05,350
对
- Yes.

179
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:08,640
关于末等人 有两件事你该知道
- Well, there's two things you should know about Tailies.

180
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:12,190
我们的记性很好 而且打仗我们总赢
We have long memories and we win wars.

181
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:13,770
是吗
- Oh, yeah?

182
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:18,650
上一场战争是我们赢了 这一场也一样
We won the last one. And we'll win this one.

183
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:22,240
你想当个碍我们事的人吗
And do you wanna be the guy who stands in the way?

184
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:24,370
惠金斯
Hmm, Whiggins?

185
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:29,410
律师先生 给你十分钟的时间
- You have ten minutes, Counselor.

186
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,290
我替你开门
Let me just get the door for you.

187
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:41,300
派克
- Pike?

188
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:43,760
姑娘 你的气色不错啊 没有缺胳膊少腿
- You're looking good, girl, with those arms dangling down.

189
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,010
你不该来这里 太危险了
- You shouldn't be here. It's too dangerous.

190
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:49,270
-我得把你弄出去 -等等 告诉我发生了什么
- I'm gonna get you out of here. - Wait, wait, wait. Tell me what happened.

191
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:53,810
威尔福德用大炮把雷顿赶走了 此刻我们正在黑暗中瞎转
- Wilford drove Layton off with cannon fire. Now we're rolling around in the dark.

192
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:58,070
如果威尔福德在躲着雷顿 那我们就得给雷顿发信号
- Well, if Wilford is hiding, then we need to signal Layton.

193
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:00,610
我得先把你救出去
- I'm gonna get you out of here first.

194
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:04,490
不行的 要救我 你得先杀了惠金斯 然后找到克利福德
- You can't. You'd have to kill Whiggins, and then you'd have to find Clifford

195
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:06,990
把他也杀了 因为钥匙在他手里
and kill him too, 'cause he's got the keys.

196
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,160
还有谁 继续说
- Go on.

197
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,370
派克先生
- Pike, Mr. Pike,

198
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,630
你是个好人 一个勇敢的好人
you're a dear man and a brave one,

199
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:17,130
但这场战争比你我都重要
but this war is bigger than us.

200
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,340
我要怎么给雷顿发信号呢
- How do I signal Layton?

201
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:26,300
我有个主意
- I've got an idea,

202
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:29,260
但你得去列车前列的待客部
but you'll have to get uptrain to hospitality.

203
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:42,990
阿莎 你还好吗 在这里还行吗
Asha. Hey, you good in there?

204
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:47,120
对不起 我们让你卷进了 最激烈的对抗中 来
I'm sorry, I dropped you right in the thick of it. Here.

205
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,950
嘿
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

206
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:50,450
发生什么事了
- What's going on?

207
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:52,580
威尔福德先生把这列车弄坏了
Did Mr. Wilford cripple the train?

208
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:55,120
没有 听着 这只是猫鼠之争 好吗 没事的
- No, look, it's just some cat and mouse, all right?

209
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:56,790
你们是猫
It's fine.

210
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,710
你们八个人 要对付伟大的威尔福德先生
- And you're supposed to be the cat? Eight of you against the great Mr. Wilford.

211
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:01,050
“伟大的威尔福德先生” 跟你想象中的不一样
- The great Mr. Wilford is not who you think he is.

212
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:02,840
不是他救了你们大家吗
- Isn't he the one that saved all of you?

213
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,430
是我们自己救了自己
- We saved our own damn selves.

214
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:06,720
他打造这列列车 只是为了自己能称王
He built all of this just so he could be king.

215
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,970
-那现在轮到你称王了 -不 这是我们的私人恩怨 好吗
- So now it's your turn? - No. This is personal for us, okay?

216
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:12,890
登上列车时 我有一个伴侣 她现在怀着身孕
I have a partner that I boarded with. I have a child on the way.

217
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:19,940
如果你这么做是为了一个孩子 你会做出让自己后悔的事的
- Oh, if you're doing this for a child, you will do things that you will regret.

218
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,780
我只是过来警告你
- I just came in to warn you.

219
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,570
我们不会放弃的
We are not giving up.

220
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:27,910
局势好转之前 会变得更加恶劣 明白吗
This is gonna get worse before it gets better, okay?

221
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:29,910
-明白 -坚持住
- Okay. - Hold on.

222
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:43,050
你是我的阳光
- ♪ You are my sunshine

223
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:47,010
我唯一的阳光
♪ My only sunshine

224
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:51,010
当天空灰暗时
♪ You make me happy

225
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:54,680
会带给我欢乐
♪ When skies are gray

226
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:58,560
你永远都不知
♪ You'll never know, dear

227
00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:02,320
我有多么爱你
♪ How much I love you

228
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:09,740
请别将我的阳光带走
♪ Please don't take My sunshine away

229
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:11,620
要知道 你唱歌的时候
- You know, when you sing,

230
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:15,660
我几乎都能说服自己说 你的为人并不坏
I can almost convince myself you're not a horrible person.

231
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:17,210
谢谢
- Thank you.

232
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,170
然后我会想起来你只翻唱别人的歌 所以歌词其实不代表你的心声
- And then I remember you only sing covers, so the words aren't actually yours.

233
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,710
歌词只是点缀而已
- Lyrics are just dressing.

234
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:26,760
我只为他歌唱
I sing for him.

235
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:28,630
老天
- Oh, God.

236
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,970
你显得很不屑
- You scoff,

237
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:34,310
但归根结底 那就是全部
but at the end of the day, that's all there is.

238
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:36,680
你为之歌唱的那个人
A person you sing for.

239
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:46,440
贝丝 你的那个人是谁
Who's that to you, Bess?

240
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:57,080
你一路坚持到了世界末日 居然会没有一个那样的人
How do you get all the way to the end of the world and have no one?

241
00:16:58,540 --> 00:16:59,710
我有
- I have people.

242
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:02,380
谁
- Who?

243
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:06,880
雷顿、扎拉、罗齐
- Layton, Zarah, Roche.

244
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:08,670
罗齐
- Roche?

245
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,090
没错 罗齐
- Yeah, Roche.

246
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:13,510
他就像我的导师兼益友
He was like a mentor to me and--and a friend.

247
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:18,680
尽管我跟他对着干 他还是罩着我
Even though I fought him, he-- he had my back.

248
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:22,020
不 我不会为他歌唱
No, I don't-- I don't sing for him.

249
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:24,860
但是每一天
But not a day goes

250
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:27,480
我都在想着把他从抽屉房弄出来
by when I don't think about getting him out of those Drawers.

251
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:31,240
我很遗憾
- I'm sorry.

252
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:35,280
希望他能活下来
I hope he survived.

253
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:38,540
是呀
- Yeah.

254
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:48,090
我们在山脊上了 注意观察
- We're at the ridge. Eyes up.

255
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:51,800
如果他在山谷里 这是能找到他的最佳位置
If he is in the valley, this is the best vantage point.

256
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:01,440
-有发现吗  -提尔
- Anything? - Till?

257
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,940
没有 什么都没发现
Negative. There's nothing.

258
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:05,900
但他们不可能就这样消失不见啊
- But they can't just vanish.

259
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:12,280
（待客部）

260
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:39,220
（W 新年流程）

261
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:40,850
好戏登场
- Time to put on a show.

262
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:11,260
看南面 在山谷的尽头 你们看到了吗
To the south, far end of the valley. Are you guys seeing this?

263
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:14,090
我的天啊 等等
- Oh, my God. Wait, wait, wait.

264
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:15,590
那是…
Is that-

265
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:18,970
我们的支持者还在
They're still with us.

266
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:29,650
看到你了 约瑟夫
- We see you, Joseph.

267
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:53,050
他正试图逃跑 在山脊东侧 往干线方向去
- He's making a break for it. East over the ridge to the trunk line.

268
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:57,430
他想偷偷溜出铁路站场 我们在这里有战术优势
He wants to sneak out of the rail yard because it's where we have tactical advantage.

269
00:19:57,510 --> 00:20:00,010
他要是跑出去了 接下去好几天就都是直线轨道
- If he gets out of the valley, he's looking at days of linear track.

270
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,640
我们能赶到他前面去吗
- Can we beat him to it?

271
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,470
-艾莉  -不行
- Alex? - No.

272
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:06,180
我不知道 也许行吧 我没把握
I don't know, maybe. It's all assumptions.

273
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:07,890
那我们还等什么 加速啊
- What are we waiting for? Pedal down.

274
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,480
我们在山口截住他
- Let's cut 'em off at the pass.

275
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:13,400
工程师 加足马力
- Full throttle, Engineer.

276
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,650
先生 恕我直言 我们的油耗非常快
- Sir, with respect, we're draining really fast.

277
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:17,490
稍微开慢点 燃油效率会更高
A few ticks slower would be more efficient.

278
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:19,240
他们已经看到我们了 他们要来了
- They've seen us. They're coming!

279
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:24,410
用上所有的储备燃油 越过这该死的山脊
Tap every last reserve and get us over that bloody ridge!

280
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,670
拜托 你这是干什么
- Come on! What are you doing?

281
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:42,470
强壮男孩 给你挑
- So you have a choice, Strong Boy.

282
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:47,180
接下来要我砸碎两根手指呢 还是砸碎你的拇指
I can take two fingers next time or I can take your thumb.

283
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:49,730
你也可以聪明一点
Or you could be smart

284
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:52,770
就像你自告奋勇 到我桌子这里来时一样
like when you bravely volunteered to step up to my table here.

285
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:57,570
威尔福德只是要你提供信息 报出你同党的姓名
Wilford just needs you to start talking and name your collaborators.

286
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:00,950
不干
No.

287
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:05,240
-不干  -拜托 别再折磨他了
- No? - Come on. Leave him alone!

288
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:10,000
-抓住他 -不要
- Hold him. - Ah, no! No!

289
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:17,590
够了
Stop!

290
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,430
我没答应过要趟这浑水
- I didn't sign up for this.

291
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:25,510
我只是想经营夜总会 提供酒水和歌曲
Just wanted to serve some drinks and play some tunes.

292
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,810
你能放松点吗 战争都是丑陋的
- Would you relax? War is not pretty.

293
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:30,640
但威尔福德会奖励我们的
But Wilford will reward us.

294
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,440
前提是他能赢
- If he wins.

295
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,820
他当然会赢
- Of course he'll win.

296
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:37,280
万一他输了呢
If he doesn't?

297
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,990
到时候雷顿进来发现这件事 知道我们也在场 怎么办
- And Layton rolls in here, finds this? Finds us?

298
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,910
威尔福德的傀儡夫妻
Wilford's little wedding puppets.

299
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:46,870
行刑的人又不是我们 我们只是提供了场地而已
- We're not the torturers, all right? We're just providing a venue.

300
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:49,960
我觉得被肢解的这个家伙 可不会这么认为
- I'm sure the mutilated guy will be quick to sort that out.

301
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,540
听着 如果你不打算开口
Look, if you're not gonna talk,

302
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:56,380
那你就不再需要这舌头了
I guess you don't need that tongue anymore.

303
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:57,920
请抓好他
Hold him, please.

304
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:04,760
抓好他
Hold him, hold him.

305
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:06,350
张嘴
Open up.

306
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:27,580
听着 即便我们追上了他 我们还是要应付他的鱼叉炮
- Look, even if we catch up with him, we still have the harpoon issue,

307
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:29,040
我们也没法进行车尾对接
and we can't connect end to end.

308
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,790
因为我们绝对打不过他的军靴
We'll never overpower his Jackboots.

309
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:33,080
没错
- No.

310
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:34,210
没错
- No.

311
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:39,750
所以我们得想办法进入机车 我们需要引开他的注意力
So we need a plan to get into his engine. We need a distraction.

312
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,050
奥德丽
- Audrey.

313
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:54,310
这是要干什么
- What's this?

314
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:56,440
手放在背后
- Hands behind your back.

315
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:59,610
手铐 我就知道你有性怪癖
- Ooh, handcuffs. I knew you had a kink.

316
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:02,780
快走
- Move.

317
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,450
祝好运
- Good luck.

318
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:15,920
这里的气氛很压抑嘛
- It's moody in here.

319
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:17,920
坐下
- Sit.

320
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:23,630
还有多远
- How much further?

321
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:28,140
快到山脊了 但我们的燃油即将耗尽
- We're almost at the ridge, but we're basically running on fumes.

322
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:31,180
继续开 它能行的 然后就胜券在握了
- Keep pushing. She'll make it. Then we're home free.

323
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,940
悠着点 本
- Nice and easy, Ben.

324
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:49,320
约瑟夫
- Joseph.

325
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:08,180
大爱丽丝 这里是雪国列车 请回话
- Big Alice, this is Snowpiercer. Come in.

326
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:14,100
雪国列车呼叫大爱丽丝 请回话
Snowpiercer to Big Alice, come in.

327
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:15,270
先生 我该回答吗
- Sir, should--should I answer?

328
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:16,480
不要
- No, no.

329
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:22,520
大爱丽丝 请回答
- Come in, Big Alice.

330
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,660
这里是大爱丽丝 我在跟谁通话呢
- This is Big Alice. To whom am I speaking?

331
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:34,620
威尔福德 我是那个 挡在你和开放轨道之间的人
- I'm the guy standing between you and open track, Wilford.

332
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:39,040
我看到了 这么说 现在就看谁的胆子更大了 是吗
- I see that. So it's a game of chicken, is it?

333
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:42,540
按你们行进的速度 我觉得你开不到那么远
- At the rate you're going, I don't think you'll make it this far.

334
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:46,130
大爱丽丝的韧劲比你想象的强
- Oh, Big Alice has more fight than you know.

335
00:24:47,130 --> 00:24:48,720
雷顿 这次会面是你发起的
You called this meeting, Layton.

336
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:55,350
所以 有话快说 没必要在这里做无聊的争执
So go on, or are we just gonna stand here pissing off our prows?

337
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,480
我们离开时 你我有个约定
- When we left, we made a deal.

338
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,900
我确保奥德丽安全…
I keep Audrey safe--

339
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:03,270
我记得 我就不把大家杀了
- I remember, and I don't murder everyone.

340
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,770
是的 我记得我们的约定
Yes, I remember the deal.

341
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:08,150
我要提醒你一句 那是在胁迫下作出的约定
It was made under duress, I'll remind you.

342
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,570
但我还是遵守了
But I stuck to it.

343
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,240
扎拉呢
- Where's Zarah?

344
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,370
她就在这里
- She's right here.

345
00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:18,710
满面红光
Positively glowing.

346
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:20,750
我在这里 安德烈 我没事
- I'm here, Andre. I'm okay.

347
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:22,960
奥德丽呢
- And Audrey?

348
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:25,800
我想听到她的声音
I want to hear her.

349
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,720
我得知道她没事
I need to know she's all right.

350
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:37,310
交出列车控制权 你就可以亲自跟她说话了
- Surrender the train and you can tell her yourself.

351
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:41,100
交出控制权
- Surrender?

352
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:44,860
我们会给你们一节头等车厢 提供美食酒水
- We'll give you a car in First, food, drink.

353
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,530
你们俩可以相守到老
You two can live out your years together.

354
00:25:48,530 --> 00:25:52,780
也就是说 我把一切都给你
- So I--I give you absolutely everything,

355
00:25:53,370 --> 00:25:55,780
而你只会给我一点小小的恩赐
and you give me a little piece back in return?

356
00:25:55,870 --> 00:25:57,740
这个提议太可笑了吧 雷顿
That's quite some offer, Layton.

357
00:25:57,830 --> 00:26:01,710
我的提议是 用非暴力的形式了结这件事
- The offer is, we end this without violence,

358
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:07,090
否则就回到那个铁路站场 我们会把你拆成碎片
or you could roll back down into that rail yard and we'll pick you apart.

359
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:08,380
完了 先生 燃油耗尽了
- That's it, sir. We're tapped.

360
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,590
我拒绝
- No deal.

361
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:36,910
我想听听她的声音
I...I want to hear her voice.

362
00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:51,920
约瑟夫
- Joseph.

363
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:12,240
（危险）

364
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,820
好了 本 我到冷封门了
- All right, Ben, I'm at the cold-Lock.

365
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:30,460
快了
Soon, soon.

366
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:43,730
设置自动驾驶 急速后退
- Auto-engaging hot reverse.

367
00:27:43,810 --> 00:27:46,140
我们应该调换一下车尾车头 让大爱丽丝在后面推
We should switch helms and get Big Alice pushing again.

368
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:48,230
停车 工程师
- Full stop, Engineer.

369
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,190
关闭电源
Let her power down.

370
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,610
-什么  -约瑟夫
- What? - Joseph.

371
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,080
这不可能是好事
- That can't be good,

372
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:03,950
会是好事吗
can it?

373
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:05,500
不会
- No.

374
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
雪国列车
- Snowpiercer,

375
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,840
我们没动力 启动不了了
we are dead on the tracks.

376
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:14,840
如果你们不跟我们连接 列车上所有的人都会冻死
If you don't reconnect, everyone will freeze to death.

377
00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:23,010
你这是不顾一切了
- You're desperate.

378
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:26,180
而你则没得选择
- And you have no choice.

379
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:34,780
准备连接 哈维…
- Prepare to connect. Javi, abre una cerveza, amigo.

380
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:43,870
指挥官 把你的突击小组 派到连接点去
- Commander, move your boarding party to the connection point.

381
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,040
发电不足容量
- Generation deficit.

382
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,250
整个列车的温度正在下降
Train-wide temperature is dropping right now.

383
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,040
最好把你的毛衣穿上
- Better get your woolies on.

384
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:53,550
来吧 小伙子们 准备好了吗
- All right, boys, you ready?

385
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:59,220
出去 瞄准中心点 记住射击目标
- Move out. Remember where to aim.

386
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,180
他们在准备连接了
- They're preparing to dock.

387
00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:04,060
他们别无选择
- They've got no choice.

388
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:07,680
又要开始了 快走 快
Let's go, let's go. Move, move, move.

389
00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:09,310
驾驶舱没问题
- Cap okay?

390
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,610
嘿 留神点 进去
- Hey, watch your back. Move it, move it!

391
00:29:17,530 --> 00:29:18,990
这太疯狂了 本
- This is crazy, Ben.

392
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:20,910
是呀 强盗生涯就是如此
- Yeah, pirate's life.

393
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:22,280
见鬼
- Shit.

394
00:29:22,370 --> 00:29:23,410
没事的
- You're all right.

395
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:25,990
用你敢开的最快速度倒车
Just reverse her in as fast as you dare.

396
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,250
见鬼
- Shit.

397
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:31,370
我们就位之前不要与对方连接
- And don't reconnect until we're in position.

398
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:41,470
好了 各位 记住 我们要先把对方清除干净
- Hey, remember, people, we're gonna clear it first.

399
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:44,220
武器准备好 上
- Weapons ready? Move!

400
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:55,690
老天
- Christ.

401
00:29:56,270 --> 00:29:57,280
乔瑟芬
Josephine.

402
00:29:58,650 --> 00:29:59,820
她回来了
She's back.

403
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:03,070
真够有种的
The bloody balls.

404
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:08,910
你是爬上来的吗 小流浪汉
Did you climb aboard, you little hobo?

405
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:13,000
这里有孕妇哦
Uh-uh, baby on board.

406
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:17,000
不 你不会的
No, you won't.

407
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:18,960
她不会的
She won't.

408
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:27,220
见鬼 真够狠的
Damn. Good one.

409
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:03,090
叫你的人退下 否则我就把你扔出列车去
- Tell your men to stand down or I will throw you off this train.

410
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:18,940
我是首席工程师威尔福德
- This is Head Engineer Wilford.

411
00:31:20,610 --> 00:31:22,860
突击小组 退下
Boarding party, stand down.

412
00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:29,740
我们不打算…
We will not be taking...

413
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,870
用武力拿下雪国列车
Snowpiercer by force.

414
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:40,590
退下 放下武器
Stand down. Weapons down.

415
00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:43,670
我的天啊
- Oh, my God.

416
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,810
这下开心了
- Happy now?

417
00:31:57,650 --> 00:31:58,810
快说
- Say it!

418
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:14,410
安德烈雷顿拥有了列车控制权
- Andre Layton has the train.

419
00:32:18,290 --> 00:32:19,880
雪国列车的公民们…
- Citizens of Snowpiercer...

420
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:28,590
我们回来了
We're back.

421
00:32:54,490 --> 00:32:57,250
50米 40米
50 meters, 40 meters,

422
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,580
25米
25 meters...

423
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,300
不可能就这样结束了
- It can't be just over.

424
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:20,270
我觉得该是选择胜利一方的时候了
- Well, I think it's about time we get on the right side of history.

425
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:33,780
给
- Here you go.

426
00:33:41,170 --> 00:33:42,080
奥斯
Oz,

427
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:44,840
我非常爱你
I love you so much.

428
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:07,360
抵抗军万岁
- Long live the Resistance!

429
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,700
-找到了 -鲁丝
- Ah, found it. - Ruth?

430
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:01,000
安德烈
- Andre.

431
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:04,960
你没穿制服 我都认不出你了
- I never would have found you. You're in civvies.

432
00:35:07,790 --> 00:35:10,670
我记得威尔福德 把他的好酒藏在这里了
I remembered that Wilford had a secret tipple up here.

433
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:14,220
-我正需要喝两口 没错 -我想着我们可以庆祝一下
- Oh, could use some of that. - Wanna celebrate? - Yes.

434
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,680
欢迎回来 你能回来真是太好了
- Oh, welcome home. It's good to have you back.

435
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:22,930
我就知道你能把大家团结在一起
- I knew you'd hold everyone together.

436
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:23,940
干得漂亮
Well done.

437
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:28,150
我们来喝吧
- Let's do it.

438
00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:29,860
把他们放出来
- Take them out.

439
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:36,070
他情况稳定
- He's stable.

440
00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:44,660
卡莉情况稳定…还有安娜…
Carly's stable. And Anne--

441
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:40,590
哈维
- Javi.

442
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:53,690
嘿
Hey.

443
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:03,830
天啊
- Oh, man.

444
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:16,550
非洲之角这个暖点 你真的相信它能维持生命生长
- This warm spot, the Horn of Africa, you really believe it can support life?

445
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:20,090
是的 鲁丝 我们的未来就在那里 我非常坚信这一点
- Yeah, our future is there, Ruth. I believe it with all my heart.

446
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:25,220
通往非洲之角的轨道是整个铁路网内
- You know, the Horn of Africa, the approach is maybe the worst stretch of track on

447
00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:26,350
最糟的一段
the entire network.

448
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:28,480
而且气候崩溃时 那里发生过一场战争
And there was a war there when the climate crashed.

449
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:29,940
嗯 我记得
- Yeah, yeah, I remember.

450
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:32,400
大家都累坏了 安德烈
- The people are tired, Andre.

451
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,520
这六个月艰苦漫长 而你回来后的第一个命令
It's been a long six months, and your first order

452
00:37:34,610 --> 00:37:36,650
就是要让他们再经历更多艰辛
is gonna be to steer them right back into more hardship?

453
00:37:36,730 --> 00:37:38,860
我不会下达命令 我们会投票决定
- Mm-mmm, there won't be an order. We'll put it to a vote.

454
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:42,070
-投票  -是的
- A vote? - Yeah.

455
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:45,950
我们要让大家看看 民主已经获胜 我们要一起选择前进的道路
We'll show them that democracy has won. We'll choose our path forward together.

456
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,710
你已经准备好面对投票结果了
- And you're prepared for the outcome of this vote?

457
00:37:49,790 --> 00:37:52,290
我会让大家相信这值得冒险一试
- I am going to convince them that it is worth the risk.

458
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,130
雪国列车已经损毁不堪 不抛锚已是万幸
Snowpiercer's running on duct tape and prayers.

459
00:37:55,210 --> 00:37:57,760
这是一个真实的能下车的机会
This is a real opportunity to get off.

460
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,760
这也是对你的投票 安德烈
- It's also a vote on you, Andre.

461
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:04,760
列车上的很多人并不支持你的领导
Much of the train doesn't support your leadership.

462
00:38:05,890 --> 00:38:07,470
这件事不止关系到我
- This isn't just about me.

463
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,680
这也是梅兰妮会想要的
It's what Melanie would have wanted.

464
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:12,810
那好
- All right.

465
00:38:13,310 --> 00:38:15,440
我去通知公证处
I'll, uh, inform the notary.

466
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:18,860
我知道列车上的所有人 都会慎重地投出这一票
I know that everyone aboard will take their vote to heart,

467
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,650
但万一投票结果是“不去” 你有这思想准备吗
but are you prepared to accept it if they vote no?

468
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:27,660
你最好仔细琢磨一下要怎么说服大家
You better think long and hard about exactly what it is you're gonna tell them.

469
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:40,090
只准你待在三等车厢 而且禁止进夜车
- You're confined to Third and barred from the Nightcar.

470
00:38:40,170 --> 00:38:42,930
-约瑟夫呢  -奥德丽 你站错队伍了
- Where's Joseph? - You picked the wrong side, Audrey.

471
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:49,220
这该死的列车上有过正确的队伍吗
- Has there ever been a right side on this goddamn train?

472
00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:53,440
这一切都会崩塌的 等着瞧吧
It's all gonna go to shit. You'll see.

473
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:09,620
直接扎穿了我的手
- It went straight through my hand.

474
00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:12,540
这样你就能记住我们了
- Something to remember us by.

475
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:15,000
看看你呀
- Look at you.

476
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:18,590
怪物来找它的创造者
A monster come for its creator.

477
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:22,260
很有诗意吧
It's poetic, isn't it?

478
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:27,890
雷顿没法把列车团结起来的
- Layton can't hold it together, you know.

479
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:30,510
他们会再次拒绝他的领导
They'll reject him again.

480
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:34,560
我是这列车的灵魂
I am the train.

481
00:39:48,530 --> 00:39:49,780
投票
- A vote?

482
00:39:50,830 --> 00:39:51,740
没错
- That's right.

483
00:39:53,790 --> 00:39:55,410
你今天也会有投票的权利
You'll get a vote today too.

484
00:39:58,330 --> 00:39:59,920
政治
Politics.

485
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,840
当你是世上最后一个人的时候 就会忘记政治的存在
You forget about them when you're the last person on Earth.

486
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:06,340
谢谢你
Thank you.

487
00:40:07,010 --> 00:40:08,340
先别忙着谢我
- Don't thank me just yet.

488
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:10,890
我有件事要你帮忙
There's something I need to ask of you.

489
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:14,850
安德烈 你救了我的命
- You brought me back to life, Andre.

490
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:19,230
要我帮什么
What is it?

491
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:03,440
各位乘客同伴们
- My fellow passengers...

492
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:10,570
今天是这列列车启程以来第一次
Today, for the first time since our departure...

493
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:15,120
由你们来决定我们的目的地
you will have a say in our destination,

494
00:41:16,830 --> 00:41:18,910
而且你们的选择将决定我们的未来
and your choice will determine our future.

495
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:23,130
你们已经知道 梅兰妮牺牲了自己 为我们绘制了一份地图
By now, you know that Melanie's sacrifice gave us a map.

496
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:27,550
证明地球上有些地方正在变暖
Proof that there are places on the Earth that are warming.

497
00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:31,800
我们之前轻装出发 快速地测试了每一个暖点
Traveling fast and light, we tested each of them.

498
00:41:32,550 --> 00:41:36,850
苏拉威西岛、古吉拉特邦、马那瓜
Sulawesi, Gujarat, Managua,

499
00:41:37,850 --> 00:41:39,020
阿塔卡马
the Atacama.

500
00:41:40,310 --> 00:41:42,100
但它们都不合格
And each one of these let us down.

501
00:41:43,230 --> 00:41:46,480
我知道 当初我们分开列车的决定
I know that you have suffered badly

502
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,700
害你们历尽了艰苦
because of our decision to break the train.

503
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:54,830
但还有一个地方 我觉得大家应该寄予希望
But there is one more location on which I ask you to stake your hope:

504
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,540
那就是非洲之角
the Horn of Africa.

505
00:41:58,870 --> 00:42:01,250
返回那里的行程会充满风险
The journey to return there will be fraught with risk

506
00:42:01,330 --> 00:42:03,210
艰辛还将继续
and the hardships will continue,

507
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:07,920
但这里有一个人 能让我们重树信心
but we have someone here who can renew our faith.

508
00:42:11,470 --> 00:42:13,640
一个我们以前觉得不可能存在的人
Someone we had given up on believing in.

509
00:42:22,390 --> 00:42:23,400
他这是在干什么
- What's he doing?

510
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:25,520
我会让她自己跟你们说
- But I'll let her tell you.

511
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:28,190
他在编瞎话
- He's bullshitting.

512
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,790
我叫阿莎
- My name is Asha.

513
00:42:44,670 --> 00:42:46,670
我是一个幸存者
I am a survivor.

514
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:49,550
雷顿在外面找到了我
Layton found me out there, outside.

515
00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:54,260
在户外 生长了树木
Along with trees,

516
00:42:54,930 --> 00:42:56,470
青草
green grass...

517
00:42:58,100 --> 00:42:59,430
和生命的地方
and life.

518
00:43:02,890 --> 00:43:04,600
我来自新伊甸园
I come from New Eden.

519
00:43:26,130 --> 00:43:29,960
我不是要你们 在我和威尔福德之间做出选择
- I'm not asking you to choose between me and Wilford.

520
00:43:32,050 --> 00:43:35,180
而是请你们在我们熟悉的列车
I am asking you to choose between the train we know

521
00:43:36,390 --> 00:43:38,100
和我们不熟悉的梦想之间做出选择
and the dream we don't.

522
00:43:41,850 --> 00:43:44,060
非常感谢大家作出的牺牲
Thank you all so much for your sacrifices.

523
00:43:50,770 --> 00:43:53,610
这个故事需要一个英雄 所以我们就带回了一个英雄
The story needed a hero, and we brought one back.

524
00:43:54,530 --> 00:43:57,110
鉴于那番表演
- Well, in the wake of that performance,

525
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:58,490
投赞同票的人胜出
the yeas have it.

526
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:00,660
几乎是2比1的比例
Almost two to one.

527
00:44:02,790 --> 00:44:03,830
多说一个谎又怎样呢
- What's one more lie?

528
00:44:03,910 --> 00:44:06,620
区别在于 这是我们说的最后一个谎话
- The difference is, this is the last one

529
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:07,750
我很怀疑
we will have to tell.

530
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:10,840
我开始觉得这列列车需要谎言
- Well, I doubt that. I've come to think this train demands a lie.

531
00:44:12,210 --> 00:44:17,340
没错 就像虚构的机车中的天才
- Yeah, like an imaginary genius in the engine.

532
00:44:17,430 --> 00:44:20,470
或是梅兰妮用完美的科学手段 来拯救我们
- Or Melanie saving us with perfect science.

533
00:44:20,550 --> 00:44:23,430
或是为我们指路的幸存者
- Or a survivor to show us the way.

534
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:25,520
所以…
- So...

535
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:28,600
-我们继续前进 -同意
we press on. - Agreed.

536
00:44:29,310 --> 00:44:31,020
我们还能怎样
- What else are we gonna do?

537
00:44:32,610 --> 00:44:33,570
乔西
- Josie?

538
00:44:35,070 --> 00:44:36,450
我们最好是对的
- Well, we better be right.

539
00:44:44,620 --> 00:44:48,540
各位乘客同伴们 我们伟大的征程将继续
- Fellow passengers, our great endeavor continues.

540
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:55,260
你们已表态 根据少数服从多数原则 我们将前往新伊甸园
You have spoken, and by majority rule, we are heading for New Eden.

541
00:45:24,490 --> 00:45:29,500
