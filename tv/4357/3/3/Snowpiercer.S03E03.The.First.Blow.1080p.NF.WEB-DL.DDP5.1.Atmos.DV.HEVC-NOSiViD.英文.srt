1
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:15,910
Move!

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,330
- I was born for battle.

3
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:20,540
Built for it.

4
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:26,340
Sometimes in battle, a perfectly crafted plan gets compromised.

5
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:31,300
A true general comes up with a better one right there on the spot,

6
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:34,640
working without a net

7
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:40,560
and sticking the landing to thunderous applause.

8
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,990
- Hurry up, you dogs!

9
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:48,570
Let's go! Let's go!

10
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:56,870
- Where are they?

11
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:59,870
- They were coming straight at us and then veered away on a sidetrack.

12
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,170
This line bends Southwest.

13
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:03,750
At that speed, they could be 20 kilometers away by now.

14
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,420
- Or coming about to nip at our heels.

15
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,010
- I'm sorry, sir. There was no warning.

16
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:10,470
- No, they saw to that, didn't they? No satellite coverage.

17
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:12,930
A moonless night. An ambush from the shadows!

18
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:14,800
- As cowardly as the day they left, sir.

19
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:16,850
- No, they didn't drive by for nothing.

20
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:19,730
Forward lamps to full.

21
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,270
Brake!

22
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:30,490
There's a moment in a fight when that first blow lands

23
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:32,070
and everything stops.

24
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:37,120
And in that flash of clarity, you know who you are.

25
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:42,500
I'll push as hard as it takes to get my engine back.

26
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:47,840
Snowpiercer, 1,023 cars long.

27
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:07,270
Full thrust. Push through it.

28
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,360
- Sir, if that axel-- - Full power, Engineer. Now!

29
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:21,790
- Well done, sir. Round one to you.

30
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:25,290
- No, no, that trap wasn't meant to stop us.

31
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:26,830
It was meant to slow us down.

32
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,750
We can't have any setbacks today, Kevin.

33
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,380
Ruth's people will be energized. Find them.

34
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:32,840
- I know just where to start.

35
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,050
- Take the gloves off.

36
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:36,390
Make an example.

37
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,010
- I thought you'd never ask.

38
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:42,850
- And Kevin? - Yes, sir.

39
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,690
- Send Zarah to me.

40
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:49,360
What's our speed?

41
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,030
- 14 kilometers an hour.

42
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,950
- All right, Mr. Layton, you got us at a crawl.

43
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:56,700
What's the play?

44
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:02,870
Layton knows better than to connect end to end.

45
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:05,670
My Jackboots would just sweep in and crush him.

46
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:09,460
So he's going to peck at us from the side.

47
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:10,630
- He needs parallel track.

48
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:13,760
- And this rail yard is an entire maze of it.

49
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:32,480
He broke free of the snare but slowed down.

50
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:35,780
- We can get right up alongside him in these sidings.

51
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:38,070
They'll be in position in 2 kilometers.

52
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,320
- Bring us around, Ben.

53
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:40,490
- Copy that. - How long we got?

54
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:41,410
- Three, four minutes.

55
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:43,240
- All right, stay sharp. Let's get this done.

56
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:44,700
I'll make sure Josie's ready.

57
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,960
- Bess.

58
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:52,750
♪ Bess Till

59
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,550
♪ Bess! - Audrey, shut it.

60
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:58,050
- What's happening? Is it him?

61
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:01,430
- You'll know it's him when his head is on a pike.

62
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,900
- You ready for this?

63
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:14,480
- Ben takes us close. I jump over, breach the Big Alice engine,

64
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:15,610
and you reconnect.

65
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,990
- We only get one shot at it.

66
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:21,160
- Well, then, better not miss it.

67
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:48,060
- Zarah,

68
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:49,270
just in time.

69
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:51,730
Thought you should be here for this.

70
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:53,610
- As a hostage or a spectator?

71
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:55,980
- As my confidante, nothing less.

72
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:56,900
Come.

73
00:04:57,650 --> 00:04:58,530
Come on.

74
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:02,570
Have a look.

75
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,120
See,

76
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:08,540
that's your old life creeping up our flank.

77
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:10,500
- Are they attacking?

78
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,380
- Maybe they're here to surrender.

79
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:15,800
You see any white flags?

80
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:21,220
- No. - No.

81
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,390
No, and if I had to guess,

82
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:25,100
I'd say they're trying to cut the head off the snake.

83
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:27,520
But I have a surprise for them.

84
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:36,480
- Heave.

85
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:40,360
Heave.

86
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:44,660
- Well, whatever these tin cans are for can't be good.

87
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:46,740
- Pike, man, what's the plan?

88
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,330
- Keep your eyes on your work.

89
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:53,960
- Heave. - And quit standing around! Let's go.

90
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:57,170
- Come on. What are you doing?

91
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:00,550
- All right, time to move. I'll distract them. You guys get to Ruth.

92
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:03,760
- No. Whoa, whoa. That's not how it works, man.

93
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,680
You're in charge now. You don't get caught.

94
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:14,520
Catch.

95
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,170
- We're in position.

96
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,880
- Josie, it's time.

97
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:44,800
Be careful out there.

98
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:47,220
- I'll breach the bastard, don't worry.

99
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:54,190
Now! Harpoon!

100
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:55,270
- Deploy.

101
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,360
- Opening cold-lock.

102
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:14,750
Wilford has a cannon or something. Pull back!

103
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:16,920
- Switch track. Josie, hold on.

104
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,600
- We're derailing! - Try to stabilize.

105
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:33,060
- Well done.

106
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:38,350
Never fails to amaze me.

107
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:41,520
You take so much in and give so little back.

108
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:45,700
I just hobbled your man, Zarah, and you didn't even flinch.

109
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:52,910
At this rate, the war will be over by daybreak.

110
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:08,720
- Come on. The car is damaged. We gotta go. Let's go.

111
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,310
- We have to cut it loose. It's gonna derail us.

112
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:13,850
- Cut here? That's four cars.

113
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:16,230
- It's the closest J-link. It's the only option.

114
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:18,020
- Asha's back there. - We don't have time.

115
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:20,980
- Go.

116
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:22,060
- You okay?

117
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:22,980
Thank you.

118
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:26,030
- She waited eight years outside. Can't very well kill her on day two.

119
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:27,950
- Safety's off.

120
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,660
- Disconnecting now

121
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:37,750
And we're clear.

122
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:47,380
- Here.

123
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,180
You'll be safer up here.

124
00:08:57,850 --> 00:08:58,980
Hey...

125
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:02,060
You gonna be okay?

126
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,360
- Turn out the lights.

127
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:10,910
- Sure.

128
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,490
Hold fast, okay?

129
00:09:58,290 --> 00:09:59,450
- We have a problem.

130
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:01,540
Wilford's gone.

131
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:05,960
His train went dark. He could be anywhere now.

132
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:14,840
- Switch off comms and transmitters tip to tail. Not a peep.

133
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:22,640
Zarah, what are you doing still on your feet?

134
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:24,520
You must be exhausted. Come.

135
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,900
- So what are you planning?

136
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:34,950
Bit of a lull. It'll do us good.

137
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:40,540
Catch our breath.

138
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:44,500
I've invested a lot in you. And the child.

139
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,130
I just want to keep you near me,

140
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:49,550
for your protection.

141
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:53,130
- And because they won't attack the engine if I'm in it.

142
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:54,800
- Right.

143
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:12,650
- How do you lose a 10-mile train?

144
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:15,150
- We were the ones that led him into this maze.

145
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,740
- He could be running. These six routes head out of the valley.

146
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:19,780
If he gets to linear track, we'll lose our advantage.

147
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:22,370
- Yeah, or he's around the next corner, laying in wait.

148
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:24,620
- He's gonna pick us off piece by piece.

149
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:26,290
I looked into the muzzle of that thing.

150
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:28,880
- We need to get eyes on him. Can we get to higher ground?

151
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:32,340
- Here, track follows the ridgeline. Should give us a view of the whole basin.

152
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:35,840
- Okay, let's do it. Lights out. If he's gonna go dark, so do we.

153
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,150
- Up and at 'em, lovebirds.

154
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:51,570
- Kevin! Get out. How dare you?

155
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:53,150
- Commandeering the Nightcar.

156
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:54,320
- Ugh, Kevin.

157
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,490
- On whose authority?

158
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:58,160
- Call it a wartime measure.

159
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:01,080
Oh, you didn't hear? Layton's back.

160
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:02,740
Up.

161
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:04,450
There's work to do.

162
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:27,850
- Why don't you, um, go put some coffee on?

163
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:41,070
- Who--who's there?

164
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:45,240
- Here to see the prisoner. I'm her lawyer.

165
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:47,660
- I don't think that's a thing anymore.

166
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:50,250
- Lose your helmet, Jackboot?

167
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:51,920
- Hey, come on, man.

168
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,840
Hey.

169
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,380
- Do you know me?

170
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:59,720
- You're--you're a Tailie. Forgive me, I-I don't know your name.

171
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:01,680
- I know you.

172
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,640
Whiggins.

173
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:05,350
- Yes.

174
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:08,640
- Well, there's two things you should know about Tailies.

175
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:12,190
We have long memories and we win wars.

176
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:13,770
- Oh, yeah?

177
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:18,650
We won the last one. And we'll win this one.

178
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:22,240
And do you wanna be the guy who stands in the way?

179
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:24,370
Hmm, Whiggins?

180
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:29,410
- You have ten minutes, Counselor.

181
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,290
Let me just get the door for you.

182
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:41,300
- Pike?

183
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:43,760
- You're looking good, girl, with those arms dangling down.

184
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,010
- You shouldn't be here. It's too dangerous.

185
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:49,270
- I'm gonna get you out of here. - Wait, wait, wait. Tell me what happened.

186
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:53,810
- Wilford drove Layton off with cannon fire. Now we're rolling around in the dark.

187
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:58,070
- Well, if Wilford is hiding, then we need to signal Layton.

188
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:00,610
- I'm gonna get you out of here first.

189
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:04,490
- You can't. You'd have to kill Whiggins, and then you'd have to find Clifford

190
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:06,990
and kill him too, 'cause he's got the keys.

191
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,160
- Go on.

192
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,370
- Pike, Mr. Pike,

193
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,630
you're a dear man and a brave one,

194
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:17,130
but this war is bigger than us.

195
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,340
- How do I signal Layton?

196
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:26,300
- I've got an idea,

197
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:29,260
but you'll have to get uptrain to hospitality.

198
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:42,990
Asha. Hey, you good in there?

199
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:47,120
I'm sorry, I dropped you right in the thick of it. Here.

200
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,950
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

201
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:50,450
- What's going on?

202
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:52,580
Did Mr. Wilford cripple the train?

203
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:55,120
- No, look, it's just some cat and mouse, all right?

204
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:56,790
It's fine.

205
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,710
- And you're supposed to be the cat? Eight of you against the great Mr. Wilford.

206
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:01,050
- The great Mr. Wilford is not who you think he is.

207
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:02,840
- Isn't he the one that saved all of you?

208
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,430
- We saved our own damn selves.

209
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:06,720
He built all of this just so he could be king.

210
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,970
- So now it's your turn? - No. This is personal for us, okay?

211
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:12,890
I have a partner that I boarded with. I have a child on the way.

212
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:19,940
- Oh, if you're doing this for a child, you will do things that you will regret.

213
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,780
- I just came in to warn you.

214
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,570
We are not giving up.

215
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:27,910
This is gonna get worse before it gets better, okay?

216
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:29,910
- Okay. - Hold on.

217
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:43,050
- ♪ You are my sunshine

218
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:47,010
♪ My only sunshine

219
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:51,010
♪ You make me happy

220
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:54,680
♪ When skies are gray

221
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:58,560
♪ You'll never know, dear

222
00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:02,320
♪ How much I love you

223
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:09,740
♪ Please don't take My sunshine away

224
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:11,620
- You know, when you sing,

225
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:15,660
I can almost convince myself you're not a horrible person.

226
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:17,210
- Thank you.

227
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,170
- And then I remember you only sing covers, so the words aren't actually yours.

228
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,710
- Lyrics are just dressing.

229
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:26,760
I sing for him.

230
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:28,630
- Oh, God.

231
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,970
- You scoff,

232
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:34,310
but at the end of the day, that's all there is.

233
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:36,680
A person you sing for.

234
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:46,440
Who's that to you, Bess?

235
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:57,080
How do you get all the way to the end of the world and have no one?

236
00:16:58,540 --> 00:16:59,710
- I have people.

237
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:02,380
- Who?

238
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:06,880
- Layton, Zarah, Roche.

239
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:08,670
- Roche?

240
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,090
- Yeah, Roche.

241
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:13,510
He was like a mentor to me and--and a friend.

242
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:18,680
Even though I fought him, he-- he had my back.

243
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:22,020
No, I don't-- I don't sing for him.

244
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:24,860
But not a day goes

245
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:27,480
by when I don't think about getting him out of those Drawers.

246
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:31,240
- I'm sorry.

247
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:35,280
I hope he survived.

248
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:38,540
- Yeah.

249
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:48,090
- We're at the ridge. Eyes up.

250
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:51,800
If he is in the valley, this is the best vantage point.

251
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:01,440
- Anything? - Till?

252
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,940
Negative. There's nothing.

253
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:05,900
- But they can't just vanish.

254
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:40,850
- Time to put on a show.

255
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:11,260
To the south, far end of the valley. Are you guys seeing this?

256
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:14,090
- Oh, my God. Wait, wait, wait.

257
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:15,590
Is that-

258
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:18,970
They're still with us.

259
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:29,650
- We see you, Joseph.

260
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:53,050
- He's making a break for it. East over the ridge to the trunk line.

261
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:57,430
He wants to sneak out of the rail yard because it's where we have tactical advantage.

262
00:19:57,510 --> 00:20:00,010
- If he gets out of the valley, he's looking at days of linear track.

263
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,640
- Can we beat him to it?

264
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,470
- Alex? - No.

265
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:06,180
I don't know, maybe. It's all assumptions.

266
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:07,890
- What are we waiting for? Pedal down.

267
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,480
- Let's cut 'em off at the pass.

268
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:13,400
- Full throttle, Engineer.

269
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,650
- Sir, with respect, we're draining really fast.

270
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:17,490
A few ticks slower would be more efficient.

271
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:19,240
- They've seen us. They're coming!

272
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:24,410
Tap every last reserve and get us over that bloody ridge!

273
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,670
- Come on! What are you doing?

274
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:42,470
- So you have a choice, Strong Boy.

275
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:47,180
I can take two fingers next time or I can take your thumb.

276
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:49,730
Or you could be smart

277
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:52,770
like when you bravely volunteered to step up to my table here.

278
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:57,570
Wilford just needs you to start talking and name your collaborators.

279
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:00,950
No.

280
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:05,240
- No? - Come on. Leave him alone!

281
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:10,000
- Hold him. - Ah, no! No!

282
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:17,590
Stop!

283
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,430
- I didn't sign up for this.

284
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:25,510
Just wanted to serve some drinks and play some tunes.

285
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,810
- Would you relax? War is not pretty.

286
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:30,640
But Wilford will reward us.

287
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,440
- If he wins.

288
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,820
- Of course he'll win.

289
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:37,280
If he doesn't?

290
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,990
- And Layton rolls in here, finds this? Finds us?

291
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,910
Wilford's little wedding puppets.

292
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:46,870
- We're not the torturers, all right? We're just providing a venue.

293
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:49,960
- I'm sure the mutilated guy will be quick to sort that out.

294
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,540
Look, if you're not gonna talk,

295
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:56,380
I guess you don't need that tongue anymore.

296
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:57,920
Hold him, please.

297
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:04,760
Hold him, hold him.

298
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:06,350
Open up.

299
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:27,580
- Look, even if we catch up with him, we still have the harpoon issue,

300
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:29,040
and we can't connect end to end.

301
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,790
We'll never overpower his Jackboots.

302
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:33,080
- No.

303
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:34,210
- No.

304
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:39,750
So we need a plan to get into his engine. We need a distraction.

305
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,050
- Audrey.

306
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:54,310
- What's this?

307
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:56,440
- Hands behind your back.

308
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:59,610
- Ooh, handcuffs. I knew you had a kink.

309
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:02,780
- Move.

310
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,450
- Good luck.

311
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:15,920
- It's moody in here.

312
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:17,920
- Sit.

313
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:23,630
- How much further?

314
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:28,140
- We're almost at the ridge, but we're basically running on fumes.

315
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:31,180
- Keep pushing. She'll make it. Then we're home free.

316
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,940
- Nice and easy, Ben.

317
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:49,320
- Joseph.

318
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:08,180
- Big Alice, this is Snowpiercer. Come in.

319
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:14,100
Snowpiercer to Big Alice, come in.

320
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:15,270
- Sir, should--should I answer?

321
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:16,480
- No, no.

322
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:22,520
- Come in, Big Alice.

323
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,660
- This is Big Alice. To whom am I speaking?

324
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:34,620
- I'm the guy standing between you and open track, Wilford.

325
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:39,040
- I see that. So it's a game of chicken, is it?

326
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:42,540
- At the rate you're going, I don't think you'll make it this far.

327
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:46,130
- Oh, Big Alice has more fight than you know.

328
00:24:47,130 --> 00:24:48,720
You called this meeting, Layton.

329
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:55,350
So go on, or are we just gonna stand here pissing off our prows?

330
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,480
- When we left, we made a deal.

331
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,900
I keep Audrey safe--

332
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:03,270
- I remember, and I don't murder everyone.

333
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,770
Yes, I remember the deal.

334
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:08,150
It was made under duress, I'll remind you.

335
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,570
But I stuck to it.

336
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,240
- Where's Zarah?

337
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,370
- She's right here.

338
00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:18,710
Positively glowing.

339
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:20,750
- I'm here, Andre. I'm okay.

340
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:22,960
- And Audrey?

341
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:25,800
I want to hear her.

342
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,720
I need to know she's all right.

343
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:37,310
- Surrender the train and you can tell her yourself.

344
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:41,100
- Surrender?

345
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:44,860
- We'll give you a car in First, food, drink.

346
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,530
You two can live out your years together.

347
00:25:48,530 --> 00:25:52,780
- So I--I give you absolutely everything,

348
00:25:53,370 --> 00:25:55,780
and you give me a little piece back in return?

349
00:25:55,870 --> 00:25:57,740
That's quite some offer, Layton.

350
00:25:57,830 --> 00:26:01,710
- The offer is, we end this without violence,

351
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:07,090
or you could roll back down into that rail yard and we'll pick you apart.

352
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:08,380
- That's it, sir. We're tapped.

353
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,590
- No deal.

354
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:36,910
I...I want to hear her voice.

355
00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:51,920
- Joseph.

356
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,820
- All right, Ben, I'm at the cold-Lock.

357
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:30,460
Soon, soon.

358
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:43,730
- Auto-engaging hot reverse.

359
00:27:43,810 --> 00:27:46,140
We should switch helms and get Big Alice pushing again.

360
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:48,230
- Full stop, Engineer.

361
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,190
Let her power down.

362
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,610
- What? - Joseph.

363
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,080
- That can't be good,

364
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:03,950
can it?

365
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:05,500
- No.

366
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
- Snowpiercer,

367
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,840
we are dead on the tracks.

368
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:14,840
If you don't reconnect, everyone will freeze to death.

369
00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:23,010
- You're desperate.

370
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:26,180
- And you have no choice.

371
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:34,780
- Prepare to connect. Javi, abre una cerveza, amigo.

372
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:43,870
- Commander, move your boarding party to the connection point.

373
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,040
- Generation deficit.

374
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,250
Train-wide temperature is dropping right now.

375
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,040
- Better get your woolies on.

376
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:53,550
- All right, boys, you ready?

377
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:59,220
- Move out. Remember where to aim.

378
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,180
- They're preparing to dock.

379
00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:04,060
- They've got no choice.

380
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:07,680
Let's go, let's go. Move, move, move.

381
00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:09,310
- Cap okay?

382
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,610
- Hey, watch your back. Move it, move it!

383
00:29:17,530 --> 00:29:18,990
- This is crazy, Ben.

384
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:20,910
- Yeah, pirate's life.

385
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:22,280
- Shit.

386
00:29:22,370 --> 00:29:23,410
- You're all right.

387
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:25,990
Just reverse her in as fast as you dare.

388
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,250
- Shit.

389
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:31,370
- And don't reconnect until we're in position.

390
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:41,470
- Hey, remember, people, we're gonna clear it first.

391
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:44,220
- Weapons ready? Move!

392
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:55,690
- Christ.

393
00:29:56,270 --> 00:29:57,280
Josephine.

394
00:29:58,650 --> 00:29:59,820
She's back.

395
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:03,070
The bloody balls.

396
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:08,910
Did you climb aboard, you little hobo?

397
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:13,000
Uh-uh, baby on board.

398
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:17,000
No, you won't.

399
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:18,960
She won't.

400
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:27,220
Damn. Good one.

401
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:03,090
- Tell your men to stand down or I will throw you off this train.

402
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:18,940
- This is Head Engineer Wilford.

403
00:31:20,610 --> 00:31:22,860
Boarding party, stand down.

404
00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:29,740
We will not be taking...

405
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,870
Snowpiercer by force.

406
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:40,590
Stand down. Weapons down.

407
00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:43,670
- Oh, my God.

408
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,810
- Happy now?

409
00:31:57,650 --> 00:31:58,810
- Say it!

410
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:14,410
- Andre Layton has the train.

411
00:32:18,290 --> 00:32:19,880
- Citizens of Snowpiercer...

412
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:28,590
We're back.

413
00:32:54,490 --> 00:32:57,250
50 meters, 40 meters,

414
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,580
25 meters...

415
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,300
- It can't be just over.

416
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:20,270
- Well, I think it's about time we get on the right side of history.

417
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:33,780
- Here you go.

418
00:33:41,170 --> 00:33:42,080
Oz,

419
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:44,840
I love you so much.

420
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:07,360
- Long live the Resistance!

421
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,700
- Ah, found it. - Ruth?

422
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:01,000
- Andre.

423
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:04,960
- I never would have found you. You're in civvies.

424
00:35:07,790 --> 00:35:10,670
I remembered that Wilford had a secret tipple up here.

425
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:14,220
- Oh, could use some of that. - Wanna celebrate? - Yes.

426
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,680
- Oh, welcome home. It's good to have you back.

427
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:22,930
- I knew you'd hold everyone together.

428
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:23,940
Well done.

429
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:28,150
- Let's do it.

430
00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:29,860
- Take them out.

431
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:36,070
- He's stable.

432
00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:44,660
Carly's stable. And Anne--

433
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:40,590
- Javi.

434
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:53,690
Hey.

435
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:03,830
- Oh, man.

436
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:16,550
- This warm spot, the Horn of Africa, you really believe it can support life?

437
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:20,090
- Yeah, our future is there, Ruth. I believe it with all my heart.

438
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:25,220
- You know, the Horn of Africa, the approach is maybe the worst stretch of track on

439
00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:26,350
the entire network.

440
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:28,480
And there was a war there when the climate crashed.

441
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:29,940
- Yeah, yeah, I remember.

442
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:32,400
- The people are tired, Andre.

443
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,520
It's been a long six months, and your first order

444
00:37:34,610 --> 00:37:36,650
is gonna be to steer them right back into more hardship?

445
00:37:36,730 --> 00:37:38,860
- Mm-mmm, there won't be an order. We'll put it to a vote.

446
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:42,070
- A vote? - Yeah.

447
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:45,950
We'll show them that democracy has won. We'll choose our path forward together.

448
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,710
- And you're prepared for the outcome of this vote?

449
00:37:49,790 --> 00:37:52,290
- I am going to convince them that it is worth the risk.

450
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,130
Snowpiercer's running on duct tape and prayers.

451
00:37:55,210 --> 00:37:57,760
This is a real opportunity to get off.

452
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,760
- It's also a vote on you, Andre.

453
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:04,760
Much of the train doesn't support your leadership.

454
00:38:05,890 --> 00:38:07,470
- This isn't just about me.

455
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,680
It's what Melanie would have wanted.

456
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:12,810
- All right.

457
00:38:13,310 --> 00:38:15,440
I'll, uh, inform the notary.

458
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:18,860
I know that everyone aboard will take their vote to heart,

459
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,650
but are you prepared to accept it if they vote no?

460
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:27,660
You better think long and hard about exactly what it is you're gonna tell them.

461
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:40,090
- You're confined to Third and barred from the Nightcar.

462
00:38:40,170 --> 00:38:42,930
- Where's Joseph? - You picked the wrong side, Audrey.

463
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:49,220
- Has there ever been a right side on this goddamn train?

464
00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:53,440
It's all gonna go to shit. You'll see.

465
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:09,620
- It went straight through my hand.

466
00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:12,540
- Something to remember us by.

467
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:15,000
- Look at you.

468
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:18,590
A monster come for its creator.

469
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:22,260
It's poetic, isn't it?

470
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:27,890
- Layton can't hold it together, you know.

471
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:30,510
They'll reject him again.

472
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:34,560
I am the train.

473
00:39:48,530 --> 00:39:49,780
- A vote?

474
00:39:50,830 --> 00:39:51,740
- That's right.

475
00:39:53,790 --> 00:39:55,410
You'll get a vote today too.

476
00:39:58,330 --> 00:39:59,920
Politics.

477
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,840
You forget about them when you're the last person on Earth.

478
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:06,340
Thank you.

479
00:40:07,010 --> 00:40:08,340
- Don't thank me just yet.

480
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:10,890
There's something I need to ask of you.

481
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:14,850
- You brought me back to life, Andre.

482
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:19,230
What is it?

483
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:03,440
- My fellow passengers...

484
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:10,570
Today, for the first time since our departure...

485
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:15,120
you will have a say in our destination,

486
00:41:16,830 --> 00:41:18,910
and your choice will determine our future.

487
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:23,130
By now, you know that Melanie's sacrifice gave us a map.

488
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:27,550
Proof that there are places on the Earth that are warming.

489
00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:31,800
Traveling fast and light, we tested each of them.

490
00:41:32,550 --> 00:41:36,850
Sulawesi, Gujarat, Managua,

491
00:41:37,850 --> 00:41:39,020
the Atacama.

492
00:41:40,310 --> 00:41:42,100
And each one of these let us down.

493
00:41:43,230 --> 00:41:46,480
I know that you have suffered badly

494
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,700
because of our decision to break the train.

495
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:54,830
But there is one more location on which I ask you to stake your hope:

496
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,540
the Horn of Africa.

497
00:41:58,870 --> 00:42:01,250
The journey to return there will be fraught with risk

498
00:42:01,330 --> 00:42:03,210
and the hardships will continue,

499
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:07,920
but we have someone here who can renew our faith.

500
00:42:11,470 --> 00:42:13,640
Someone we had given up on believing in.

501
00:42:22,390 --> 00:42:23,400
- What's he doing?

502
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:25,520
- But I'll let her tell you.

503
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:28,190
- He's bullshitting.

504
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,790
- My name is Asha.

505
00:42:44,670 --> 00:42:46,670
I am a survivor.

506
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:49,550
Layton found me out there, outside.

507
00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:54,260
Along with trees,

508
00:42:54,930 --> 00:42:56,470
green grass...

509
00:42:58,100 --> 00:42:59,430
and life.

510
00:43:02,890 --> 00:43:04,600
I come from New Eden.

511
00:43:26,130 --> 00:43:29,960
- I'm not asking you to choose between me and Wilford.

512
00:43:32,050 --> 00:43:35,180
I am asking you to choose between the train we know

513
00:43:36,390 --> 00:43:38,100
and the dream we don't.

514
00:43:41,850 --> 00:43:44,060
Thank you all so much for your sacrifices.

515
00:43:50,770 --> 00:43:53,610
The story needed a hero, and we brought one back.

516
00:43:54,530 --> 00:43:57,110
- Well, in the wake of that performance,

517
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:58,490
the yeas have it.

518
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:00,660
Almost two to one.

519
00:44:02,790 --> 00:44:03,830
- What's one more lie?

520
00:44:03,910 --> 00:44:06,620
- The difference is, this is the last one

521
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:07,750
we will have to tell.

522
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:10,840
- Well, I doubt that. I've come to think this train demands a lie.

523
00:44:12,210 --> 00:44:17,340
- Yeah, like an imaginary genius in the engine.

524
00:44:17,430 --> 00:44:20,470
- Or Melanie saving us with perfect science.

525
00:44:20,550 --> 00:44:23,430
- Or a survivor to show us the way.

526
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:25,520
- So...

527
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:28,600
we press on. - Agreed.

528
00:44:29,310 --> 00:44:31,020
- What else are we gonna do?

529
00:44:32,610 --> 00:44:33,570
- Josie?

530
00:44:35,070 --> 00:44:36,450
- Well, we better be right.

531
00:44:44,620 --> 00:44:48,540
- Fellow passengers, our great endeavor continues.

532
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:55,260
You have spoken, and by majority rule, we are heading for New Eden.
