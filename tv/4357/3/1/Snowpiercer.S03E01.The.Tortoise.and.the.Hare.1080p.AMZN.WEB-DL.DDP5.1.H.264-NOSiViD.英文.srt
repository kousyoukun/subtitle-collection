1
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:11,760
- Two trains, two chapters to tell.

2
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:16,720
One runs hot and fast.

3
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:22,900
The other lumbers slow...

4
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,690
Cold-cast in Wilford's iron grip...

5
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:32,030
An armored tortoise plodding after a hare...

6
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,990
Everyone under a single thumb...

7
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:38,370
Serving a single obsession...

8
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:43,920
To retake the pirates and exact his revenge.

9
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,210
I can smell them.

10
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,510
Layton took my engine through here

11
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:54,050
about a month ago, judging by the ice buildup.

12
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,220
Practically on their heels.

13
00:00:57,970 --> 00:00:59,020
You see?

14
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,180
Like old footprints in the snow.

15
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,560
Set switch for the south fork, Engineer.

16
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:09,070
We'll get it back, Jupe, whatever it takes.

17
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:07,460
- Inside, it's a backwards world.

18
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:09,750
Only one class now,

19
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:12,840
the working class, freezing, stitching,

20
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:16,930
fixing, suffering.

21
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:34,900
- Hey, this isn't a pass-through.

22
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,830
- Winnipeg. - Message for the top.

23
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:55,050
- But frostbitten fingers hold fast.

24
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:00,300
Deep in the iced-over bowels where Wilford never treads...

25
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:04,890
A spark still lives:

26
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:07,350
the resistance,

27
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:11,440
nurtured and protected by the bravest of the brave.

28
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:18,740
- Message for the tippity-top.

29
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:22,700
- I didn't hear the password, Mr. Pike.

30
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:24,990
I expect more from my second in command.

31
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:27,580
They picked up sign of Snowpiercer.

32
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:30,710
We turned south, back on the main line.

33
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:32,420
Oh, thank God for that.

34
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:39,470
This is the first proof we've had that they are still alive in 32 days.

35
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:42,800
They must--they must have their reasons for all this traipsing about.

36
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:44,060
I mean, if Melanie's aboard--

37
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:46,270
We don't know.

38
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:52,440
- You ever think, Ruth, all alone down here at night,

39
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,900
that since Layton bailed on us in the first place,

40
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:56,570
he might never come back?

41
00:03:58,110 --> 00:03:59,820
No, I don't.

42
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:03,910
And neither do you, or you wouldn't be in the resistance.

43
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:08,450
- So antibiotics for the seamstresses. They'll need them,

44
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,750
all jammed up together in that sweatshop.

45
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:13,290
It's these little things that will keep us sane, Mr. Pike.

46
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:16,300
The passengers can survive all of this if we can ease their journey.

47
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:19,550
And keep them ready for Mr. Layton's return.

48
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:25,680
- The heart of hope still beats aboard Wilford's rolling gulag,

49
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:28,980
1,023 cars long.

50
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,100
Okay. Should be clear of track contaminants.

51
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,680
I'm gonna start pulling ice samples.

52
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:12,440
How's it looking?

53
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,650
- Palm trees, golden sands.

54
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:17,110
Gotta catch me some North Korean waves.

55
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:19,440
- Nice. I'll grab my board. I'll be right out, bro.

56
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:20,360
- Let him focus.

57
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,700
- I'm keeping him calm. - You're distracting him.

58
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:25,110
- Ben, the suit's at 22 minutes. Your heart rate's good.

59
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,740
You steady on, okay?

60
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:27,870
Copy that.

61
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,170
Engine any happier?

62
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,590
- We're venting, but still too hot.

63
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:43,670
How's it looking?

64
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:47,140
Oh, minus 86.

65
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,140
Oh, well, I'm sure glad we came all this way.

66
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:52,020
- Well, don't mistake the weather for the climate.

67
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:54,560
Ben's samples will show us the full picture.

68
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,060
We're looking for trends.

69
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:58,270
- I thought we were looking for a place to live.

70
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,690
The model likes this spot. Let's just wait for the results.

71
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:01,610
Oh, the model.

72
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:04,950
- Hey, Till, remember how much the model liked Sulawesi?

73
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:06,570
Yeah, I do.

74
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:09,530
Six months of going around the world with nothing to show for it.

75
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:11,370
- And we learned something from every stop.

76
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:13,910
Think of them as data points.  Okay, Professor Layton.

77
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,830
- They were not frozen hellscapes. They were data points.

78
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,920
Correct.

79
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,350
Shit.

80
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:34,060
- I need to talk to him. - Okay.

81
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,650
- Ben, we just blew a thermal switch on the main line.

82
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:41,020
- It's gotta be an error. - It isn't.

83
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:42,860
We came in too rich. I told you that.

84
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:46,360
- Just discharge the excess, Alex. She'll rebalance.

85
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:49,200
If I discharge any more, we won't be able to get going again.

86
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:51,870
We have to abort. Pull him in.

87
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:55,330
She's wrong, Layton. She can ride the levels.

88
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:56,460
Ten more minutes.

89
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:59,130
- We're burning up. We need to go right now.

90
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,670
Do what you can.

91
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,630
- I told him we came in too rich.

92
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:06,220
Okay.

93
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:10,010
Everything's under control.

94
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:12,390
- Ben, just stay on task. Okay?

95
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,240
Hey.

96
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:33,660
She touchy this morning?

97
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:35,370
- Scathing. So mean.

98
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,620
- Sykes is on her way. - Great.

99
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:42,500
Why have we stopped again?

100
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:46,050
You know, they're not gonna find an oasis. - You know that.

101
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:49,220
- I don't know anything. It's easier that way.

102
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:52,850
- Ugh, know no one, feel nothing. You're a woman alone, my jailer.

103
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:54,350
Well, at least I got you.

104
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,430
You gonna be civil, or do you want me to feed you in there?

105
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:00,310
Monsters first.

106
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:01,690
- No, please. - No.

107
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:05,980
- Okay. Today's dwindling selection.

108
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,320
We have the boeuf bourguignon,

109
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:12,570
the carbonara, the dreaded chicken mushroom bag,

110
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,950
and the last Thai vegetable.

111
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:17,450
- You seem to enjoy working for these pirates.

112
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:20,040
- Just a POW doing my time, Audrey.

113
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,380
- Well, he'd be disgusted with your cooperation.

114
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,090
Can you please?

115
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:27,590
- If nobody wants the Thai vegetable... - Just give me the carbonara, Martin.

116
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:29,800
Carbonara, it's the worst.

117
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:36,560
- Ben? Ben, the wind's picking up. It looks like there's a front coming in.

118
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,850
- Copy that. I'm on my way back.

119
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:39,770
- How's Alex?

120
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:40,770
- Alex, status.

121
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:42,350
We're not actively on fire.

122
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:44,230
Tell him to hurry.

123
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:47,480
- She says she took your advice and everything's working out.

124
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:52,200
So much blown snow.

125
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,070
A lot of wind comes through this basin.

126
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,370
- Well, that's good, though, right?

127
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,030
Could be.

128
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,750
Might be our warm spot stirring things up.

129
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,730
- Ben. - Ben?

130
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:24,100
- Ben. - Ben, come in, Ben.

131
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:26,310
- I can't see him. - Ben.

132
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,360
- Ben! Ben, do you copy? Ben.

133
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:36,620
Ben, come in.

134
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:54,050
The bit I don't get, Bess,

135
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:56,510
when we return to Wilford with your precious climate model,

136
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:57,430
what happens then?

137
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,350
Negotiations.

138
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:01,390
Both trains want to reconnect.

139
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:03,600
- Yeah. Hostage negotiations first.

140
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,940
You for Zarah.

141
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:07,940
- Yeah, but then what?

142
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:10,400
- Wilford's 2,700 to your 7?

143
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,150
He's not gonna take too kindly to a traitor and a stowaway.

144
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,200
How am I a stowaway?

145
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,110
I woke up from a nap in my carriage and the train was gone,

146
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,580
along with my husband and my twin boys.

147
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:20,490
Till here.

148
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,370
- Yeah, I need you to lock them down and get up here.

149
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:24,710
- What's up? - Nothing they need to know about.

150
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,120
- All right. On my way.

151
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:27,960
Ben, do you read?

152
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,460
All right, that's lunch. Martin, lock her up.

153
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:32,250
- Is something wrong? - Move, go.

154
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:39,470
- Hey, I saw Ben going outside earlier. - Do you need help?

155
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:42,010
- No, everything's good. We're good.

156
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:42,970
On it.

157
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,690
- Till. Hey,

158
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,520
what's going on?

159
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,560
You stay in your quarters.

160
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:51,730
Wait till the engine gives the all-clear.

161
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:54,400
- That's it? - Yep.

162
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,290
I'm going out there. - No, you're not. I'm going.

163
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:09,210
- Neither of you are going anywhere.

164
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:11,460
We can't stay here. Ben.

165
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:13,880
Ben, do you copy? We are not leaving him.

166
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:16,510
- Layton, if we don't get rolling right now, we will melt down.

167
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:17,840
How long do you need?

168
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:20,010
- 8 minutes to get up to speed,

169
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:22,300
10 to 12 minutes to run a discharge sequence.

170
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,310
- Great. Go. - And leave you outside?

171
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:27,310
- The breach suits have 30 minutes. You go, you come back for me.

172
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:29,650
- You are staying here. - Yeah. Like, hell I am.

173
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:35,110
It's not a discussion, Josie.

174
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:38,320
If all three of us get in trouble out there, there's no one left for off-train work.

175
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,490
- Yeah, well, I'll make sure that doesn't happen.

176
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:41,910
- You know, one time,

177
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:45,040
just for a change of pace, you could respect the chain of command.

178
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,290
Chain of command?

179
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:51,040
Layton, this isn't a battleship. It's a bloody life raft.

180
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:52,210
And you're staying on it.

181
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,470
- Ben shouldn't even be out there.

182
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:01,550
- He knew what he was getting into. - Yeah. Chasing Melanie's ghost.

183
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,640
Her theory.

184
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:05,850
We all agreed.

185
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:07,680
We find New Eden, then we go back for the others.

186
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:09,480
- And what if there is no New Eden?

187
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:11,650
What if she's wrong?

188
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,360
Guess we just all go down with her, eh?

189
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:21,860
- Till, you're gonna have to pilot us out of here.

190
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:23,320
- Me? Why?

191
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:25,030
- Because I need to go deal with that.

192
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,120
- What?

193
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:27,910
Oh, Jesus. Jesus.

194
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,000
Yeah, okay. I--I got it.

195
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:47,770
- You're starting to believe your own hype. You do know that, don't you?

196
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,890
- I'm just trying to keep everyone alive.

197
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:52,980
Yep. We know. Our great savior.

198
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:53,940
Never my words.

199
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,570
- I was there at the beginning in The Tail, in the muck and the shit.

200
00:12:57,650 --> 00:12:59,190
I know who you are.

201
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,110
- You encouraged me to be a leader.

202
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,150
- Not for this.

203
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:04,910
Didn't ask for any of this.

204
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:10,870
- Engine, we're at the bay door. Release the safety.

205
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:13,830
Uh, copy.

206
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,460
Bay door safety?

207
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:17,090
System panel, top right.

208
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,780
Josie, be careful.

209
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:43,700
- Yeah.

210
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:45,950
Yeah, you too.

211
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,880
You see anything?

212
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:04,430
We're on the wrong side.

213
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:07,970
Well, we've been stopped for an awfully long time, haven't we?

214
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:13,680
Engine, we're clear. - Okay. Copy.

215
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:14,850
They're clear!

216
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:16,690
- Okay. Take us up to 20.

217
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:24,030
- Easy! Easy.

218
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,600
- This is the general consolidated ledger.

219
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:59,860
And you can see where the quartermaster detected pilfering.

220
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:03,190
- Cleverly dispersed along the supply chain.

221
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,610
- Laytonites, or what's left of them.

222
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:07,860
- Yeah. Someone's playing Robin Hood.

223
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,290
Zarah. Zarah. How are you feeling?

224
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:19,080
Enormous. - I'm fine, thank you. Oh, good.

225
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:21,380
- I have the engineering report, Javi.

226
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:24,420
- I'll take that. - Let's hear it from her.

227
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:26,590
I appreciate how you deliver bad news, Zarah.

228
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:28,760
Always a clear-eyed view.

229
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:31,050
- So, then,

230
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:36,810
your water pipes are still frozen. Most of Second and parts of Third.

231
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:40,350
And Ag-Sec output is down again, but only by 6% this week.

232
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,310
- This is pilfering. I was--

233
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:45,900
- And last night, 43 sleepers and The Chains lost heat completely.

234
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:48,570
162 passengers remain evacuated.

235
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:50,610
- Well, if we can't keep them all warm at once,

236
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,990
they'll just have to be miserable in shifts.

237
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,700
We'll cut First Class.

238
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:56,410
Out of the question.

239
00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:00,040
- Well, you did decommission it, Joseph. It's empty and frozen. - Cut the weight.

240
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:03,340
- I will restore First to glory when I get my engine back-- and Audrey with it.

241
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:07,720
- Perhaps there's another way to conserve energy. - Like a cull.

242
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,170
- No, Kevin, you ghoul.

243
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:12,300
- Please berate him. Remind him there are rules.

244
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:13,720
Sorry to disappoint, Kevin.

245
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:17,060
But minus an arm or two, we keep everyone as alive as possible

246
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:19,980
so Audrey stays as alive as possible.

247
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:22,100
- Of course. - And you too, my dear.

248
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:25,320
- That's been guaranteed,

249
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:27,780
hasn't it?

250
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:31,910
Bye, Javi.

251
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:35,660
- Rules.

252
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:39,250
The resistance is not so constrained.

253
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:43,420
Every game has rules, Kevin. Get creative.

254
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,790
Jackboot Tyson.

255
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:25,630
- Can you get me out of compost or not?

256
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:26,960
One more week.

257
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:30,130
But in the meantime, how about a nice hot bath?

258
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:32,720
You taking the piss?

259
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:37,850
Bathing token for services to the cause.

260
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:45,810
- What can we do for you, Kevin?

261
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:48,230
Ovaltine.

262
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,400
Yeah, we don't have Ovaltine. We have train-made hooch.

263
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:55,240
- Fine. One hooch.

264
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:59,030
Mr. Wilford loves what you've done with the place,

265
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:03,040
but I'm afraid he needs just a smidge more from the deal.

266
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:04,620
Information?

267
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:12,170
- The subversives continue filching and currying favor

268
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:15,590
while their shot caller keeps slipping through our fingers.

269
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:20,220
We would like this person identified and captured... now.

270
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:25,350
- Maybe our passed-out Jack knows something.

271
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:29,150
Jackboot Whiggins?

272
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:32,480
Oi, Stuie.

273
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:35,320
Wake up, Whiggins. - What?

274
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,240
You said I could stay.

275
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:41,580
- They put you on Water Security, yeah? Yes.

276
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:44,540
- You're a former Firstie, so you'll be glad to help.

277
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:47,120
- Well, what's happening in Water Security?

278
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:51,880
Uh, you know, nothing.

279
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:54,460
Yeah.

280
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:56,720
Um, well,

281
00:18:58,090 --> 00:18:59,640
you know, very little.

282
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:03,970
Kevin doesn't need much. - Just a little thread to pick.

283
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,560
Come on.

284
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:10,480
- Well, I've heard that the Second Class Watermaster

285
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,230
was giving away hot baths

286
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,110
for service to the resistance.

287
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,280
Let's have a look.

288
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:25,450
Oh, that's healing nicely.

289
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:27,250
Have you applied your cream today?

290
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,710
- No, sir. - Well, then allow me.

291
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:42,350
Oh, it's all right, cub. It's all right. You like me now.

292
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:46,060
This business with Jupiter.

293
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:49,350
I know she's a blunt tool, Javier.

294
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:54,230
But when you're one man responsible for nearly 3,000...

295
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:58,110
It's not enough being a disciplinarian.

296
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,660
You need to add a little chaos to the mix.

297
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:02,910
In here, it's Jupiter.

298
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:06,200
Out there, it's Kevin, gnashing his teeth and running amok.

299
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,580
You can't fight the unpredictable, Javier.

300
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:13,380
That's how I keep everyone safe.

301
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:14,960
Anyway...

302
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:18,590
I hope you see it for what it is.

303
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:23,300
I do need you, Javier.

304
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:30,690
Good man.

305
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:37,940
Wilford.

306
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:39,950
Sir, we have a lead.

307
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:05,470
Watermaster Arnoldo Reyas.

308
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:18,190
Clean as a baby.

309
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,200
Come on.

310
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:32,080
Come on out before you get cold.

311
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:40,170
- The Watermaster told them where we are.

312
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:42,170
- Gotta go. - Again.

313
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:53,020
- Okay. - Okay.

314
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,310
- Come on. - I'm coming.

315
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:55,440
- There you go, that's it.

316
00:21:57,310 --> 00:22:00,070
- Oh. - No, no, no, no, no, no. Ruth, let's go, quick. Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick.

317
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:01,940
- All right. All right.

318
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:04,110
We can't all be built like a bloody whippet.

319
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,540
Come on. Come on.

320
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:21,210
We gotta go!

321
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,020
- Let's go. Let's go!

322
00:22:57,210 --> 00:23:00,210
End of the line. The First is too frozen for the subtrain.

323
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:04,920
Okay.

324
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:10,350
Crikey, it's cold.

325
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:12,390
Just wait.

326
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,110
- They were here. Right under our noses.

327
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:29,530
Treachery.

328
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:32,870
- Who are you,

329
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,450
you clever thing?

330
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:40,710
- They got it on trickle, stays around minus 25.

331
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:45,550
I'm hoping they won't look back here, because, you know, it's too cold to live.

332
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:56,220
Oh, my God.

333
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:01,350
What, Kevin couldn't put anything away?

334
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:04,860
In here, Ruth.

335
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:10,990
Watch your head.

336
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:24,340
Had a couple of our comrades gussy it up for ya.

337
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:26,550
See, minus 12.

338
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:29,340
- It's lovely, thank you. - Yeah.

339
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:31,090
- Send my regards down the line.

340
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,510
- What?

341
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:37,390
What, you likey that I'm built like a whippet?

342
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:40,140
- No. Mind your cheek.

343
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:44,400
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

344
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:52,450
- If you're out there, Mr. Layton,

345
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:55,780
now would be a great time to come home.

346
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,610
"Snowpiercer,"

347
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,860
come in. "Snowpiercer."

348
00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:37,490
Oh, shit.

349
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,250
Hey, buddy.

350
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:46,330
You bring your surfboard?

351
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:49,050
- Thought we'd do some sledding instead.

352
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:51,510
Hey, what's your suit at, man?

353
00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:53,470
- 7:45.

354
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:55,840
The Engine.

355
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:59,390
- Don't worry about the Engine. Alex is on it. Where are you hurting, Ben?

356
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:01,730
Bit of pain in the chest.

357
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:03,350
- Can you move your fingers and toes?

358
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:05,940
- All right.

359
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:08,440
I'm coming down. - Too risky, Layton.

360
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:10,150
Send down a rope.

361
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:12,820
- Oh, man. Don't worry about it. You sit tight, man. I'll be right back.

362
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:16,820
They're venting?

363
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:20,790
They're just rolling fast enough to cool down. - I don't--I don't get it.

364
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:23,080
- I do. - I don't think they got back on.

365
00:26:23,870 --> 00:26:26,290
What are you talking about? - So who's outside?

366
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:29,130
- I don't know. You think they tell me anything?

367
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:30,590
I know Ben went out.

368
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:33,090
- Yeah, well, I think I saw two more from my window.

369
00:26:33,170 --> 00:26:36,630
- Well, then Alex has to be driving. Did she ditch them?

370
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:41,100
They're not answering. Martin, it's time.

371
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:47,020
Yeah. Okay. What about Till?

372
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:49,940
- Well, we'll just have to go to the Engine and find out.

373
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:50,940
What's happening?

374
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:53,230
We have to get back with the other train.

375
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:57,320
Help us, and I won't tell Wilford you've been cooperating.

376
00:26:58,570 --> 00:27:00,160
Are you serious right now?

377
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,080
- Deadly serious.

378
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:07,080
Look, we need to reconnect. Okay? What are we doing out here?

379
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:09,920
- Yeah, we've been running around aimlessly. We're running out of food.

380
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:11,840
Last chance.

381
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:14,800
Get back with Wilford

382
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:17,840
or dig a grave with Layton.

383
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:23,810
Then get in the cage.

384
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,450
What's our speed?

385
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:47,040
Um, 75. - Okay, let's switch places;

386
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,830
I need you over here while I start the cooling sequence.

387
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:52,000
Okay, you're gonna match these lines.

388
00:27:52,090 --> 00:27:55,090
Blue to blue, red to red, and so on, you got it?

389
00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:56,050
- Yeah.

390
00:27:56,130 --> 00:27:58,340
- Be sure, Brakeman, okay? - These currents are live.

391
00:27:58,430 --> 00:28:00,590
- Yeah, match the colors. I got it. Let's go.

392
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,390
And I'm not a freaking Brakeman.

393
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:12,810
Hey.

394
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:14,860
Hey!

395
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:19,570
Okay, well, just in case they ask, you forced me to let you out.

396
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:05,120
- Hey. Time?

397
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:08,750
- Two minutes.

398
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:13,330
- All right, not to worry, brother. There's plenty to go around.

399
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:16,380
Not too much, Layton.

400
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:18,760
Let's not both run out.

401
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:20,880
Hey.

402
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:29,970
Hey, hey. All that surf stuff you talking, you really do that?

403
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:32,020
Bennet.

404
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:35,400
- Surfing? - Yeah.

405
00:29:36,770 --> 00:29:43,700
Yeah, I spent a summer in Sopelana when I was 16.

406
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:48,080
Yeah, the locals surfed a wave called El Bordillo.

407
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,370
- Oh, yeah? - Yeah.

408
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:54,750
I learned more on that wave than in seven years of university.

409
00:29:57,250 --> 00:29:58,170
You ever go back?

410
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:02,090
Yeah, once.

411
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,640
By then, the rising sea levels

412
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:08,810
changed the coastline.

413
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,930
The wave was gone.

414
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:16,650
- Shouldn't we start going back?

415
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,480
We're still too rich.

416
00:30:18,570 --> 00:30:21,150
- Well, how long? - I don't--I don't know.

417
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:25,200
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, Alex, you can do this.

418
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,700
- Okay? - I can't.

419
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,490
What would Melanie do?

420
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,540
- She would just know the answer. That's what she would do.

421
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:35,580
Okay, fine, then.

422
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,590
What would--What would Ben do?

423
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:41,460
- He would grab a pen and paper and start mansplaining.

424
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:44,420
- Okay, good. Just--just talk it out, then.

425
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:53,100
- Built to work at speed, under load,

426
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:55,100
but we have neither.

427
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:58,230
We're a jet engine strapped to a toy wagon.

428
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:00,770
All we have to do is stop on a dime

429
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:04,070
without stalling or burning up twice and once in reverse.

430
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:09,160
All right, Till, there's a three-minute window to reverse back to them.

431
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,910
Have you been avoiding me?

432
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:16,210
- I told them to lock you in the meat locker.

433
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,960
They thought the library was more secure. So much for that.

434
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:21,540
Are they all outside?

435
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:23,340
- I'm a bit busy right now, Audrey.

436
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:24,460
Well, I can see that.

437
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:33,640
Look. Look. Look, what I have.

438
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:35,180
Look!

439
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:38,600
I had it on me when they took me hostage.

440
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:42,940
I have been waiting six months for this moment.

441
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:56,330
Now let's talk about going home to Daddy.

442
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:37,370
- Hold on tight, buddy. I'll see you up there. - Josie, let's go.

443
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,000
All right, Ben.

444
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:11,740
Here you go.

445
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:15,370
All right. Nearly there, Ben. Nearly there. There, it's done.

446
00:33:16,410 --> 00:33:18,240
Over the edge, that's it.

447
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:23,080
- Josie, throw me the switch and start back with him.

448
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:27,090
- No, not till you're out of there. He's fading, Josie. Get going. I'll catch up.

449
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:35,090
What's your suit at? - Plenty. Don't worry about it.

450
00:33:36,050 --> 00:33:37,180
I'm right behind you.

451
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:39,930
Okay.

452
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:32,210
Hello.

453
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:22,390
Hello?

454
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:04,550
Layton, come in, Layton.

455
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:08,180
Layton, come in, Layton.

456
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,170
- Your mother didn't make it, Alex.

457
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:47,720
And that idea of an oasis out there died with her.

458
00:37:47,810 --> 00:37:49,020
No, it hasn't.

459
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:52,980
- Well, I think you would all be getting along much better

460
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:54,600
if you discovered anything.

461
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:56,980
- Well, you have no idea what we've discovered.

462
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:13,790
- Wilford has the answers, Alex.

463
00:38:15,830 --> 00:38:19,340
Just keep going, and you solve everything.

464
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:25,890
Just keep going.

465
00:38:46,610 --> 00:38:48,120
No, don't.

466
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,280
Get away from her.

467
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:53,450
Alex, you gotta go back.

468
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:55,870
- Ahead, Alex. Back home to him.

469
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:57,080
- We can't leave them out there.

470
00:38:57,170 --> 00:38:59,500
- Don't listen to her bleeding heart, Alex.

471
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:01,590
Just do the calculus of survival like Joseph would.

472
00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:03,710
- Stop! Both of you, just stop!

473
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:05,380
Shit.

474
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:08,680
Just go ahead!

475
00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:20,480
Alex.

476
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:23,030
Alex, stop the train. What if she was right?

477
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:25,860
What if Wilford is the best bet? - He's not.

478
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,450
Melanie is.

479
00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:30,950
Okay? We can get through this, Alex.

480
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:33,330
Don't tip it the wrong way.

481
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:37,210
Okay? Yeah.

482
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:54,780
- "Snowpiercer." Come in, "Snowpiercer."

483
00:40:59,330 --> 00:41:01,120
Layton, Layton, can you read me?

484
00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:04,040
Layton.

485
00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:07,630
"Snowpiercer," come in.

486
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:10,760
Shit.

487
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:14,180
There. There they are.

488
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,680
There's only two-- there's only two of them.

489
00:41:34,990 --> 00:41:37,200
- Wait, wait. - Sit there.

490
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:46,210
Layton, come in, Layton.

491
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:49,840
Layton,

492
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,170
come in, Layton.

493
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:55,890
Look, I'll be back, okay?

494
00:41:55,970 --> 00:41:58,220
- Josie, you've been out too long.

495
00:41:59,390 --> 00:42:01,480
- I can find him. I'll be back.

496
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:05,940
- Josie, his suit ran out five minutes ago.

497
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:20,620
Layton. Layton!

498
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,460
- What? What?

499
00:42:25,290 --> 00:42:28,840
He's there? - Yes. - He's there? He's there.

500
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:01,370
So what can I get you?

501
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:04,620
- I'd say I've got everything I ever wanted.

502
00:43:04,710 --> 00:43:05,790
A girl,

503
00:43:07,290 --> 00:43:08,580
a club,

504
00:43:08,670 --> 00:43:11,420
and the gratitude of the great Mr. Wilford.

505
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:14,210
Come on.

506
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:22,470
- Wouldn't we all love a nice warm bath?

507
00:43:23,890 --> 00:43:29,150
These two stole hot water resources from you for the resistance.

508
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:31,570
Because they had to be clean...

509
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:34,900
You go unwashed.

510
00:43:36,110 --> 00:43:37,320
You first.

511
00:43:50,170 --> 00:43:51,210
It's all right.

512
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:53,670
It was worth it.

513
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:20,410
- Well, I hate to miss a public defiling,

514
00:44:20,490 --> 00:44:23,660
but the proceedings are rather foregone, aren't they?

515
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:29,290
I'd much rather be here with my friends, embarking on a fresh path.
